Boxing cards are whack
No way he won that fight!
Is that Dusty Rhodes on commentary?
If Tyson wanted to do MMA I’m sure that could’ve been arranged. Cheeky elbow who dis guy man
Francis Ngannou has a rematch with fury if he made it to the 8th round where is the rematch  Chicken 🐔 ducking Francis Ngannou
Am I the only one who thought Francis won? Remember watching this live and thought he should've won
Rigged
Fury was allowed to fight Klitschko after failing a PED test, when he should have been serving a 2 year BAN!
Notice how fury looks directly to see what Francis reaction to losing the fight fury was surprised he won.
Fury has such a daddy body but what an amazing boxer lol
BOOOOO
Fury built like an orangutan
Fury was being nice from what I saw
Imagine debut against the heavyweight champion your first fight and losing by only 1 point.
Imagine If Francis had been training for about 2 years in boxing.
Nigerian Nightmare
What Elbow??? He at it like it was a delicious Steak😂😂😂😂🥊🥊🥊🥊
meh, tyson was probably just paid off by dana anyway. Make it a close fight
It’s embarrassing how rigged that was
Dude lost that fight Rs
Dumb, fake, fixed, staged! Embarrassing!!!!
He beat fury
Why is Tyson Fury built like a melted ice cream?
They robbed him out this
They robbed Ngannou.   He beat Fury.  I love Ngannou and I just hate to see how they can rob him of his victory like that.  SMFH.
Everyone Jocking Ngannou when he lost lol i understand he knock him down and i dont like fury at all but he outboxed ngannou🤷‍♂
I think Francis won
Tyson fury is the dirtiest fight ever
How is his talent and cardio sooo good, and he's still fat??? Like, really wondering.
Fury put zero effort into this fight and it shows. He should have done what AJ did
I’m never watching boxing again. Francis completely dominated the fight and even scored a knockdown. How on earth did the other guy win? This fight was clearly rigged!
He wasn't tested for TEST, his TEST-level was 11x normal.
He got robbed
AJ made quick work of Francis. Somehow Fury eked out a narrow victory.
If they met in an alley who wins
Fury threw that ELBOW ON PURPOSE
these highlights make it seem like francis got robbed
Have him get lil bro'd by AJ again
They simply couldn't have the reigning champion lose. But Ngannou was robbed.
Tyson fury is the goat
Fury up there lookin like butterbean 😂
Yo Francis lost this is crazy dumb
They robbed Francis lmfao
These highlights suck
ngannou won in my opinion
Thats so weird he got beat up
I thought Francis had this win  in the bag.
how does one judge get 95/94 ngannou and othe other get a 3 point discrepancy
Just proves how dead fury would be in a real fight
Fury only has size and luck on his side
Tyson just lost his balance. He was moving away from the shot and got knocked over. That shot didn't affect him. But Francis did well for his first fight for sure! He could continue in boxing if he wants to.
1st fight in boxing vs the belt holder. 1 point split decision and it seemed really weird that it was a 3 point difference for only 1 judge.
Nothing but respect for FRANCIS 💪🔥🐐
F the judges. A big F as a Failing to do their job properly.
robbbbbbbbery
Best debut boxing match ever
Mcgregor vs Maywether Fury vs Wilder  Probably the only two good cross fights
🦎💎💎
Francis should have won
francis won 95 94 without kd fury wins 96 95
If you knock down and go to a decision against the heavyweight champ then you're one of the best in the world.
Judges are either blind or bigots.....Francis was robbed of his victory Fury cheated throwing that elbow but still won....got knocked down twice but still won.....rigged
Those judges are paid well to have the furys winning all big sports are rigged
Yea give the W to the guy who got dropped and threw elbows.    Francis could’ve won all 10 rds and those judges weren’t going to let him win.
Robbery
Tyson Fury did not win that fight Francis Nagnou was robbed of the win.
Close one
robbed
They stole that fight. THey allowed Tyson to elbow and win.   Racism is real. I still love Tyson as a human, he's a great chap but he lost this fight. I don't think Tyson is racist at all but the boxing industry and most British people are.
Where's FAKE PAUL? I thought he liked boxing MMA fighters?  FRANCIS NGANNU VS FAKE PAUL
Another robbery this is what we go through as people of color
Nnganou won the fight this was so biased for the fury name
How did he win? Francis knocked him down in the third round.
Francis was straight up robbed
Francis.waa robbed. He scored a knock down. That should have been the W
You can’t beat the champ on a split decision, it just doesn’t work that way. You gotta BEAT UP the champ if you want to take his belt. I didn’t “see” the fight, but I know what a split decision means. It means the challenger actually did not do enough  to be deliver a “decisive” win. Which is what should be done if you want to get his belt.   A decisive win looks much different, and is worlds apart from, “Eh…I think he may have outboxed him?” You need to win by more than a sliver. It is the buffer the champ is afforded for being the champ. You gotta TAKE THE BELT AWAY, not slip it off his waist.
If a point was removed for the elbow, then what? Draw?
Fury looked like James Fetterman trying to get up off the mat
Gotta congratulate Ngannou again on that win. We live in a sh ithole world, you won in everyone's eyes.
Ngannou robbed.
Huh.  I had no idea this happened?!   Sub-casual apparently 🤷
I had Francis winning the moment it was over in my opinion
Tyson fury looks like a Wii boxer, a literal chicken nugget
Can’t respect Fury cause he cheats and gets away with it. Good fighter minus the cheating
He shouldn’t have let it even be this close so that they couldn’t have robbed him like the white out of shape pig they are
White robbery
Francis is the new Mike Tyson!!
The first punch did not even seem like it connected solidly at all... Oh well that's boxing for ya
He was robbed!!
Y it said still undefeated?
Fury doesn’t even look excited that he somehow won  he’s just like yeah I knew the fight was fixed for me  too always  win decision now give me that belt 😂
People Don't realize Africans built different
Tyson is pretty fast for his size even though he lost I'm impressed
Man …..Fury’s physique gets worse every time he fights. Maybe the contrast with Francis made it worse 😵‍💫🤔
WW2, Ngannou vs Fury coming soon, baby
Total robbery. Ngannou knocked Fury out senseless. And they still gave the win to Fury. Respect for both fighters, regardless.
Furry won on decision but Ng won if you watch it.
Bad decision!
If this was mma it was over for fury lmao
When ever Fury clinched Ngannou, Francis threw Tyson around like a rag doll.
Jesus Christ, Bob Arum is like a cockroach. He just won't die.
I think Fury underestimated him 😂
Congrats to Ngannou on his victory, corruption is deep

Love Ngannou btw. But after seeing Fury fight Ngannou and then AJ fight him. I think AJ cooks Fury. 💀
The highlights barely show Fury doing scoreable work, the tepid applause says it all, Fury lost the fight and knows it. If he was a man and not an ego child he would have renounced the victory on the spot. I would have. Any real man would have. Because it wasn’t a victory, it was a clear loss.
Lol everyone talking about “Francis did well and dropped fury” but when Conor mcegor fought Floyd and Floyd made it look easy y’all said he ruined the sport so which one is it ? 😂😂
Fury's 1st L 😑
There needs to be a rematch. I am patiently waiting 😢😅👍
Anybody else would of thrown there hands up after that elbow lol
Be someone the world wants to recreate 🐊🎲🎲
It’s rigged the African guy should’ve won😡🤬
I love how Fury is like, "good fight, man". All kinds of respect.
Illegal shot and knocked down, and still won? Yea ok
Who scored this fight my god
If this were in a mma cage ,  tyson would have been dead.
Robbery
Staged fights took the excitement out of sports!
When is that punk going to fight Francis again?
Cue the rematch music and workout montage.
Tyson god respect for ya man.BUT YOU NEED TO QUITE CHEATING WITH THE ELBOW BS, THIS HAS HAPPENED WAY MORE THEN ONCE, YOU NEED MAJOR CALL/FINES ON THESE. My opinion but francis won this, he put him down way more, ans had actual damage shots other then little taps that people give and get scored good, i dont get it/ rules need updated. Cause in real fight ya can tap all ya want, those hits that put people down and or hurt ya to the core mean way more then, little nose flicks 😂😂😂 boxing is becoming a complete joke!!!
Francis won
Francis got robbed
Still THE BEAST GYPSY KING!!!!
Tyson Fury. Love handles. Flab. Slow. Hits hard, true, but were the heavyweight division not so pathetic, he would not be a champion. He would have been a punching bag for heavyweights from the 1970s to the mid-2000s.
Fury didn't take this fight seriously, and just treated it like a paycheck.
Suiiiiiiiiii
He didn’t get knocked down though?
اون عربای کس مغز اونجا چه گوهی میخورن با اون لباس کیریشون .. چند ملیون دلار پول گرفتن این کیریا رو را دادن
Tyson lost this fight. They couldn't let the Jokic of boxing lose though
He was trained by mike tyson. Who was going to be qmazing
Was the fight before Usyk for Fury? If Fury couldn’t easily beat this guy idk why he thought he could win against Usyk, a skilled boxer..
Exactly.
Who's here after Oleksandr Usyk dethroned Tyson Fury?
That boy can pack a punch.
Tyson Fury look when they said he won was priceless because he know he lost... lol
Rob by the illuminati lol
Francis got robbed
Even fury was suprised he won
Isnt it a little bad for boxing that their heavy weight champ, almost got beat by a man thats never boxed before 😂
The Arabs said yeah we paying for this I’m handing over the belt 😂‼️💯
They don't want to give the win to the winner... hes not one of theirs
I know they're supposed to believe they're the best... But tyson was an idiot... saying he cant box etc
To be fair if a good boxer fought somone who was good and versatile in mma the mma fighter would prob destroy them most of the time if they were in an octagon or mma rules
You Can Tell They Robbed Him..
Robbery
Highlights?
You saw Fury fighting dirty, throwing that elbow.
Francis won this fight that's sad as he'll just boxing judges just don't wanna admit a mma fighter beat their best
Fury didn’t even train lol
The judges did okay... the champ should have to be knocked out,, thats the old rules.. that's always been... so.. fury looks like he's winding down fast anyway,, this fight was more of a trying to barely stay on,,, as it looked to me... furys body looks more out of shape than my 50 year old body,, the only reason he is anything is because his height, reach and weight has always far surpassed all of his opponents...just facts
Tyson lossed that fight anyone with a brain knows that
I see illegal elbow, got knocked down, and got hit with cleaner shots. Amazing performance but i gotta give it to francis
Tyson fury continues to be the great white hope
Tyson fury is the burliest man youll ever see
Everyone keeps saying Francis won....nah. BUT he did get a knockdown. Tyson was eating him up and showed better technique.
okay respecfully, Fury is always fat in his fights but he in this, he is extra jiggly; don't believe me? go look at his past fights, he was always heavy but not flappy. His 12 week camp for ngannou probably consisted of eating dounts all day.
Fury lost that fight. The judges gave it to him because the WBC profits off Fury's undefeated record. They didn't want him to lose his unbeaten record in a decision. Fury's a dirty boxer and everyone knows it. He headbutts, elbows and drops his hands into the palms of his gloves. There's tons of videos showing him doing it.
Really?  That was my introduction to Tyson Fury.  He can give Michael Gerard his last name back, because I truly am not impressed.
Booooyyyyy, that really couldve went either way. Fury SURELY resepcts Francis and knows to keep hush around him lol
https://youtu.be/Q_3cpQvjU50?si=9yt5jvwsuOPco4Oq
Fury took a dive when he went down but I guess he made it a point he would win the fight if he agreed maybe? I’m so confused after watching Joshua fight. Then watching that weak punch make fury drop
Highway robbery....
I think the elbow was for the back of the ear punch. The ear puch was unintentional, the elbow though...idk
Cheat
Francis has a strong core that just allows him to stand strong inside and generate torque on those short to medium range swings.
Francis trained like his life was on the line.  Fury stayed on the couch. Relying on a diet of deep fried foods, candy, & liquor   But yet still won even when not giving a fu!k.  The end
Francis was not robbed. He did land some amazing “oi bludy el” moments on Tyson, but Tyson did largely control the match. That said… most impressive pro boxing debut in history. Francis is a monster.
Ngannou won 🏆
He knocked him down and lost😮
Fury is a joke, dude has zero skill and has fought in a clown generation. Fury has absolutely no discipline and just depends on his size to carry him through. He wouldn’t have made it to the pros in the 80s or 90s or 70s. Francis is also a joke and a greedy man. Atleast Francis has some discipline. For a mma guy to fight the supposed best boxer and it to a split decision is absolutely embarrassing. I’ve done mma my entire life, and in that I’ve trained boxing but mma is so different from boxing the skills do not translate over the way these mma guys are thinking they will. Boxing is a sport, mma is fighting. I’m boxing you can concentrate everything you have on a good stance and loading up your punch’s it’s exactly what I just said it’s a sport. Mma you cannot do such things you have far more weapons and your opponent has far more weapons. These skills just don’t translate well when trying to cross. You don’t stand in the box when fighting mma the way you do in boxing, if you do your gonna get clinched, elbowed, knees and so on. Try to dip and dodge only in an mma fight and your gonna get kicked in the face. Boxers don’t have to worry about such things so someone who’s boxes their entire life has far different reflexes. Boxers won’t stand a chance in a cage not ever and mma guys need to stop trying to step into a boxing ring
Nawwww bro got robbed of a win 😢
Bless him Lord
Smh
Fury toyed with Ngannou and put on a show, ate that punch like a boss, looked jiggly and slow and made the entire world believe Ngannou is a world-class boxer 😂😂😂  It was only close because he decided to make it close, catch the documentary when he retires and the pre fight interviews currently unreleased.
Tyson fury is such a piece of dog 💩 Man he is the biggest cheater of ALL Time. Man I Really Don't Understand Why He Just Keeps On Getting Away With This Dog 💩 Fights. Are the judges paid off I mean he always does some 💩 that is so sketchy.
Wow i havent even watched boxing after The holyfeild vs Tyson era! And now i see why! Fury looks like a Slob! No real fighters since lennox lewis snd Holyfield!
Robbery
Round 1:fury 10-9 Round 2: Francis 10-9  Round 3: Francis 10-8  Round 4:10-10 Round 5: fury 10-9  Round 6:fury 10-9  Round 7: fury 10-9  Round 8: Francis 10-8  Round 9: fury 10-9  Round 10: 10-10. Overall I have it 96-95 for fury.
Had the left hook been thrown properly Fury stays down, but after that knockdown Ngannou was trying his damnedest to replicate that minor success but Fury was able to fend him off using his superior skill set.
who's here after Joshua slept him
Francis Ngannou
Aj fixed him
Robbed.
and y'all are surprised boxing is a joke?
Elbow was definitely intentional
Robbery really sad sad
How he loose
Had to come here again after AJ vs Ngannou see how good AJ actually is
Furry you did not win
How he won with an elbow?
Without any doubts, Francis Ngannou won this fight  hands down. He outboxxed Fury, he dropped him, stood his grounds, carried all that weight, and still looked the fresher of the two after the fight. Its really a shame that the judges had offer the win to Fury just to save the face of boxing. Ngannou is the real champ, both physically and at heart!!! Regardless of whatever anyone says!
Bs robbery fight
I’m here After AJ baptism of NGANNOU. DECAPITATED HIM.
People talking about an elbow like this guy wasn’t a ufc champion lol. Ate that elbow
Looks like Fury wanted to lose the fight. He did fight seriously.
Who is here after Ngannou got knocked tf out by AJ 😂😂😂😂
Fury wasn’t powerful enough.
I said from the beginning if it's closed they're going to screw Francis
Francis was definitely overrated. And he just lost to Anthony Joshua
Tyson fury is a blob. Ridiculous
SMH u knock a ninja out and still lose shits crazy
Francis so mma he ain’t even notice the forearm
Even Tyson Furys corner looked disappointed. Wow, Francis dominated.
How tf did that blob end up winning 😭
Robbery
Who here after Francis got knocked out
Didn’t think AJ would look that much better than Fury.   That’s a bad look
No way Fury won lmao
Tyson fury punches with his wrist smh
That man hits hard
robbery for the sake of making sure some prince doesn't lose his risky bet of ALL the oil money
Either this highlight reel didn't do Fury justice, or Ngannou got robbed
I swear fury the only fighter that gets knocked down in a fight and still wins by points somehow! Obviously the refs aren’t watching the same fight
Good fight and not being a hater but what a steal I mean Francis literally knocked Fury out it would have had too been a points based decision but still Francis was pretty much dominated the fight even when fury threw an elbow! Cool to the Victor but should have been Francis in my eyes!
Straight bs that there
Fury won by points but Ngannou deserved to win.
Racism helped the guy here
Ngannou won.
Tyson Fury is a dirty fighter. We all saw that elbow.
Steal? 👀
He didn't "Catch him off guard" it was a perfect counter left hook
He was robbed of a victory. Way to go Francis
Anthony Joshua is going to walk this fool down and knock him out and send him back to Africa crying.
Tyson looks big pink and nasty 🤢 🤮
He forgot he could take an elbow 💪 lol
fury with the elbow in the 6th round trying to cut Francis walked right through it lol
I feel robbed for him real talk🗣️😅
If Fury was black he would be considered the dirtiest fighter that ever lived.  He throws as many elbows as punches!!! Along with wrestling techniques...  Boxing is what he wins but not how he fights....
How do u get knocked down and throw an elbow and win man smh
Francis won that match anytime of the day
Mark my words nganno will beat aj
Francis won
Lol steroid black thing lost to a fat white man
That second judges scorecard is WACK. Any one with a slight intelligence in the sport would agree…
This just made me mad
Fury barely won this fight, it could go either way
He could have knocked fury down 12 times and he wouldn't have won. Saudis were never gonna lose on that fury, usyk Pay day. Maybe when ngannou upsets joshua he can get a stab at being the unified champion against the winner of that hopefully usyk. Although I don't know if he good outbox that slippery little guy.
Francis wins fury has a defeat Francis didn’t lose
Fury know he lost he wife knows he lost
Francis clearly won that fight, he definitely got robbed
Hey Google, Who wins by split decision if one boxer was knocked down & that same boxer throws an illegal elbow??
Tyson did not win that fight lmao
That was all about money....we  all saw what happened!!!😂 #staywoke
Boxing is a scam
I’m ngl Francis completely out fought him. I know it’s boxing and Tyson is the champ so he has to really upset him to win. But if this was a street fight it’s clear Francis would’ve mauled him😭
Nope Francis is 1-0 idk what the judges were smoking but that's crazy how he gave fury his first loss 😂
Unfair world
That punch was not technically sound. Think fury took a dive
Boxing is obviously rigged. So obvious. Those people judging are blind lol dude got clipped swing crazy first round it looks like.
Francis 🥇Won!!
HE GOT ROBBED!!!😮😮😮
Why they just didn't call it a tie ?
We all know Tyson is better in the rematch once he studies
Showing less than 2 minutes of a 10 round boxing match, is hardly a highlight.
Bruh pushed him with his lefty and he fell😭😭
Honestly Tyson lost this match I get ppv points and everything but Francis got robbed this fight. Just like wilder with the long count in the 12th round. Great fight.
Buck me did you throw the fight? It is very unlikely for a boxer like Tyson Fury to lose to someone's first boxing bout.
As a long time fan and boxing enthusiast I have to say the politics of the sport and the bias shown to the “darlings” in close fights is frustrating Tyson took an L 🤦🏻‍♂️give that man Francis his props 🥊 he sent that man straight to canvas land admission 1 🎟️✨
Rigged Tyson got destroyed
White ppl evil and don’t even know they are. He flat out elbowed him then once the bell rung he gave him dap on his glove, the tapped him on the face 👀🤣 weird ahz boy.
Yall need to see all the shots, this doesn't ahow all the fight, just looks like a highlight reel for Ngannou, he did great yet I want to see the full highlights of both fighters for that night
And he was getting advice from the original Tyson a.k.a iron Mike. I think he won the fight.
This was insane, they absolutely robbed Ngannou
He was hoping he walked into that elbow. That was dirty.
what?
I don't understand these highlights. Are these really the best shots of the match?
That elbow was nun for Francis 😂 he took worse before
Fixed you can tell by reaction of Fury when they read s ores 😮
Francis got robbed
Those judges pulled every technically out their behinds possible its quite childish😂 how do these judges look?? Is this a race thing??
Francis won that one , unfair judges
You know the fight finna be bussin when the High Table from John Wick show up to watch a outta shape Irish man get beat on🔥🔥🔥
That elbow was no accident.
He took that elbow like nothing like the UFC.  lol
This dude is cheating. He clearly be losing. This is sickening
A decision like this is why people think boxing is rigged and they have a point.
Proof that Tyson Fury is a trash cheater. I mean that elbow was flagrant. Bone against bone can cause some real damage. Dirt bag .
Boxing is a joke, that they decided fury 'won' this
My boy got cheated on
Francis was the winner
Cant win when it's rigged. All this fight did was teach me how fake professional boxing is.
How is the fat guy even fighting those good boxers?
I’m 100% positive they told Francis not to ko fury
Fury- “This ain’t wylder”
Fixed
Fury lost in of discussion
Foh ova a knock down 🤔😐
Fury throws an elbow like Francis didn’t eat those in the UFC 🤣
Boxing is a proud sport.. they are always going to score in their fighters favor .. they can’t let a guy walk in on his first fight and beat the undisputed champ …   He’ll have to KO Joshua or it’s gonna be the same thing again ..   Even when Connor fought mayweather the ref was Constantly stopping Connor and reprimanded him for nothing …   If they done get the KO they not gonna win … this Nguanuo fight prove that ….
just watch a robbery smh boxing is fixed
Who is the dude holding the belt
Luckily he's used to taking elbows to the face. He was like " that was a baby tap"
Fury lost that fight come on now
We all know who won this fight
He really started dancing over his body😂😂😂😂
They cheated
Dude thought an elbow would slow his pressure lol. Forgot that’s what he clocks in 40hrs a week for hah.
He got robbed
An MMA fighter with no professional boxing fights to his name beat the heavyweight champion of the world. Absolutely incredible.
Fury cheated
Homeboy got the shaft !!!
Them pure blood Cameroon dudes built diff tbh they like the Samoans of black people lol. Ik cause I'm black and yes ik black is different cause it's African American not from the mother land
Good thing Tysons face was in the way or that punch would of hit him full force
Ngannou won that fight AND Tyson was tryna cheat
That was a Francis W. Boxing is so corrupt
WBC is desperate to not have a black champion 😂
I was just thinking the way they fight a prime tyson would of destroyed them.
Fury getting knocked down and getting up like a middle aged father lmao.
I think Francis Ngannou is just a natural fighter. I think he would dominate in any combat sport.
Francis man-handled him. Still not sure how he lost.
Bro got robbed.
Tyson said who tf u talking to? 😂😂😂 #JesusNotForDebate
Like everybody told Floyd when he fought Conor😂 now it's time for Fury to get in the octagon with Francis😂😂😂😂 I guarantee you he will get destroyed😂
Political
Fraudulent….
If you notice at the end of the fight the ref is standing directly by Tyson ready to raise his hand, usually they are directly in between both fighters, they were prepared no matter what to give fury the win, he is the greatest fighter and probably my top three ever but Francis was robbed
That elbow didnt take points off the scorecard for furry? Just shows that furry been cheating and the boxing league has been helping him do it for years.
Francis did great but to beat the champ you have to whoop the champ!!
Robbery without a weapon!
If Francis was goin for the body more would’ve won by tko
Fury will lose to the Ukrainian..
Je thre that elbow on purpose, that was dirrty and not cool obviously
That elbow should have been a disqualification
Francis just proved he was better here came down to a split decision by one point in boxing this wouldn’t even be close in mma.
That's bs Francis won that
Francis won 150% didn’t want their fake money boxers losing lmao
Fury has gotten fat and slower. Ngganou should have won.
Yanni got robbed
Man. Ngannou got robbed. Tyson got beat up for once
Talking about Fantasy 😅😅😅
Robbed
I think fury took Francis lightly and looked at him as easy payday. I believe if they fought again fury would train harder and dominate. On other hand wht could have been if Frances would have started boxing at a younger age
Fury's corner looking real nervous when reading the score cards
0:04 weird...i didnt see him dancing like that in the 10th round lolololooloololol trash 1 punch predictable nerds always get smoked by the GOAT...once he beats Usyk and retires...whos better ??? not floyd....not floyd. sorry.
Im surprised Tyson fury looks the way he does
Got knocked down point lost from elbow boxing commission is a joke the bets dictated the results 😂
Bro jiggled when he fell
Francis did his little dance....and lost. Fury got hit in the ear. Didn't even phase him. The alpha male won. The superior man is still champion.
Robbed
Boo
Francis won that fight. Look at Tysons face. Looks like ground beef. Lol😅😅😅😂😂😂
Ngannou won
Robbery armed robbery at that
That’s a lie
lol 😂 Well that fight was…an entertainment bout…respect to Ngannou who was professional and respectful to the fight, to the sport. As for Fury, not his most impressive fight, in my opinion he lost, but it could have gone either way.
The fight was so unbelievably rigged
ALWAYS that 1 judge in the bag in boxing.ALWAYS
Two wonderful and classy champions!
Francis Nagano punch
He took an elbow 😳😳
Look at Tyson’s face….  It says it all ….   1) A knock down  2) With all the shots that landed they left their mark on Tysons face.  3) First fight against heavy weight champion… and it was a fight.  4) Judges also saw this by 1 point… it was very very close..   5) No marks on Ngannou’s face (even with that cheap shot elbow)  6) Based on knockdown and sportsmanship alone … Ngannou shocked the world!!!
They robbed Ngannou!!!
There is a misconception that Ngannou was a novice in boxing.  He actually started training and competing in boxing 12 yrs. ago in Africa inspired by watching Mike Tyson but switched to MMA when he emigrated.   I suspect the idea that he knew nothing about boxing was promoted by the Ngannou camp in order to make it seem like he couldn't box at all.  That was smart, Fury was overweight and did not appear to have trained properly, he was much slower than he usually is , did not expect Ngannou to be as skilled as he was and had no game plan.  Anything can happen in boxing if you don't prepare and underestimate your opponent.  Joshua has the advantage of knowing that Ngannou is a much better boxer than reputed and the Tyson style attack he will be employing.  He won't be stupid enough to brawl, he'll use his skills to walk Ngannou around the ring, tire  him out and pick him apart.  Joshua takes the decision by a wide margin.
Tyson Fury looks like a 6'9" software engineer. But size matters, sometimes more than skill.
Fury shrugged that punch in behind the ear like a true champ, francis should have been disqualified.
If all he looking to dodgers da right he susceptible to da left
He'll achieve his shot.. keep it full steam.
Anyone notice the dude in green next to tyson holding his one finger up before the last score card was read? Like he knew he had already won?
0:53 he actually could land a beauty right hand there but he chooses to cheat
Fransis, YOUR THE MAN
Let me guess, Francis wins the second fight and Fury wins the third. Fake. All about 💵
White excellence.
Tyson is the embodiment of a skinny fat tall irl pacman
Yea watching this fight Fury didn't look like he trained at all for this fight or took it seriously
Fury fell just like spence when bud knocked him down
Imagine Francis Ngannou in Bare Knuckle Boxing 💀
They robbed nganou
so this was a fixed exhibition?
Wack
Francus did great. Fury underestimated him. But theres  No Way that Franciis won that fight . Nganou clearly was outboxed and outclassed. But he has awesome power and caught Fury with a shot. Fury gets up and gets the job done. . And the elbow was unintentional. They happen all the time in boxing.
Absolute robbery he whooped Tyson
I don’t know what everyone else is seeing here but the guy that looks bloodied and tired and landed less punches is Fury. I just watch how they are moving and the guy that looks like he’s going to die is Fury. Francis beat him and on top of it took an elbow that wasn’t acknowledged. This fight was never going to the cards fairly to beat him Francis would’ve needed to knock out Fury. Fury has a tough chin and he’s a champion but he got beat by Francis in his debut. I’d love to see a rematch.
I am a huge fan of.both these fighters. However, That fight didnt gonthat way on my score card.
This fight was fixed before the bell even rang....😢
The a rab with the picnick cloth on his head knew before the announcement. They knew what horse they backed. They paid for it and they got what they wanted.
“Ouu!! An elbow!”
That was some amazing content girls ❤
Wait ... what. These 2 fought already 😂😢😂😂😅
Boxing is more corrupt than the NFL.
I would hate to live the life of some people in this comment section that defend fury, boxing and the “technicalities” that come with this dying sport. Like you really just wanna be right on the internet, you guys are the cornermen of guys like Apollo Creed, or what’s that one robot from the movie Real Steel, Zeus when he won the match against atom the sparring robot dummy. You guys are sore winners.
Tyson built like a stand up bag of milk😂
Francis is just notbused to being the small guy
Francis Ngannou vs. Anthony Joshua
Dana White is crying.
I mean dudes got the hardest punch in the world so
Thought this was a highlight vid
This was a real fight? Not exhibition?
Fury should’ve lost points for the elbow but instead he gets the W dirty sport
Literally lost by one point to one of the G.O.A.T.s! And instead of throwing his hands up like he shoulda one, he looked like he didn't care too much.
Francis won
Bulls#!+
Gets knocked out still eins the match in boxing....... Mafia fixed so the house wins
I should have known that something was up when they didn't take a point away from Fury for purposely throwing and connecting with that elbow, and the fact that Francis was dominant in most of the rounds plus the knockdown... yeah, this was robbery for sure, Fury knows he lost.
Ngannou is living proof of the saying "If you bet on yourself, you can't lose."
The fight went the distance. Fury hit the canvas once. Ngannou took an elbow to the face… Francis got robbed… this is why boxing fans are sick of boxing.
yall know that was weird smh
After this performance Francis cemented himself as one of the greatest athletes ever. What a story his life is, absolute cinema
And this is why boxing is dead to me, the man clearly threw and elbow and he got knockdown
Bruh this was a robbery
And people think Fury would be Jon in the octagon lol.
The judge that did 96-93 should be fired
Ngannou robbed
Ate that elbow for lunch
How he always does his thing, how much corruption, not even in sport, that fight was not won by Fury, very dissatisfied.
The Ref more worried about Ngannou dance need to be counting 😂😂
So much money is made who cares the winner!!
Francis box better then Wilder wow
😳
Lmao still wild how that elbow had francis unfazed lol..
This is the first time I've ever seen an mma fighter give trouble to a boxer in their own world
Congratulations to Francis he gets all the credit, but I hate how mma fighters and fans credit themselves for this win, even though mma nor mma trainers had nothing to do with this boxing match, MMA fans  had the chances when Floyd beat up Conor sent the last mma fighter packing like broken goods
Bombsqua
Francis won this bout... He knocked him down... Francis should have won
Wow, I would knock out Tyson fury and I weigh 190 pounds and I would bet the world that I could work this guy! 😮 I am totally convinced at this point which I’ve already known all these fights are staged. It just does not matter what happens. The decision is already determined long before punches thrown! 😮
This highlight was trash
I’m honored to see Francis last fight in ufc as champion ufc 270
That elbow should have made Tyson lose.
Yujiro Hanma busted a nut in Cameroon 😂😂😂
This fight was a clear draw for me, but I agree with decision overall it was very close to call!  Francis is a BEAST, he clearly has been one of Fury's toughest encounters to date!
Francis was the real champion b'coz real boxing fans knew there was no more furry in that Tyson's tank, 🍻
They told Francis they couldn’t give him the belt lilenthat
Didn't see anything special coming from Fury.... rigged if you ask me.
That 1 point should have been taken for that elbow and still been a draw and Fury would still have the title anyway all around good fight
Ngannou was robbed and Fury knows it.
Wait did Francis win this..was he robbed?
Black man got robbed
The fact they let that elbow from fury slide, he won the fight
Fury got exposed big time
UFC he wouldve ground n pounded finish
Fury has used dirty boxing techniques and turned boxing matches into fights. I think he had trouble mostly cause 1. Ngannou could match the size/weight and 2. Good luck makimg it gritty and putting your weight on a guy who wrestles with elite heavyweights. Heavyweight boxing and MMA is a different game.
I’m honestly not sure what’s more impressive. Ngannou flooring Fury. Or that Fury got up from ANOTHER blow that should have shut his lights off.
Fury won by points, anyone who says Ngannou won this fight doesn’t know boxing
Robbery!!!
SLO MO of Tyson’s love handles makes me want to do some side bends 😂
No mamen puto panson
This is why boxing sucks as a sport, it’s all rigged and always in favors of the favorite. Even if he loses they still say he won?!? So dumb sports be outta there
fury got beat up plain and simple
Yeah starting to think Tyson fury cheats too many suspicious things going in his fights
Tyson got floored and literally went shoooooo idk if I been hit that hard before. That image will forever live rent free in my head.
Rematch setup.
Fury got beat and everybody know it
🤬🤬😡😡😡😩
Usyk gonna beat fury. That will be fury,s last fight and a huge payday. He will pass the touch so to speak
Fury lost that.. fury kinda sucks and boring to watch
Rigged lol
Francis all the way.
And the fix was in!  3 knockdowns is an automatic win in the US
tyson is dirty to the core man that elbow was 100% intentional. hes always been dirty. typical of his culture man. they cheat to the core.
I think fury loses
how did tyson win? francis landed more powerful punches and knocked him down! i thought that they both fought terrible, but francis did knock him down and he also took a elbow and kept going. that split decision win was fixed.
I typed on YouTube Tyson fury first lost an this fight came up boxing is so ridiculous it’s crazy
Rematch!!!
Francis beat that fat idiot all night long.  He paid off the judge, paid off ref, elbowed, cheated and got knocked down in the 3rd and most missed he also got knocked down in the 7th, that was not a pull it was a punch and fat boy fell down.  Francis is the BMP (Baddest Man on the Planet).
The predator should fight someone like Andy Ruiz, Daniel Dubious, jarrel miler al winnable fights
Man I thought boxing wasn't fixed. Clearly I was wrong.
that elbow looked suspicious
Absolute rubbish the referees were paid off for sure
Fury should have had a point taken for that dirty elbow
Man was robbed😢
LOL is that Dusty Rhodes on commentary in the beginning?
Fury threw an elbow out of desperation 😂
Trying to fight a hispanic boxer or MMA fighter is like trying to fight a full-sized bush elephant with your bare hands.  They are too strong!
This didn't seem like a real fight to Fury.  He was doing alot of uncharacteristic things in that ring.
Fury is a dirty fighter. The elbow always shows up on his fights
Bro got robbed 😤
Boxing is cute because there's favorites the judges won't let lose as long as they're still standing at the end.
Tyson like Messi robbing like a clown 😂😂😂😂
This was a circus event period The greatest heavyweight champ since Rocky Marciano and John L Sullivan in a ring with a guy who head butted Tyson Fury s forehead held over and over again etc The referee was afraid to call taunting by Ngohou after a lucky punch Another black mark on a dying sport  It was a beautiful slice of Americana from the bareknuckle days until Rocky Marciano and now it is gone ,,,,,..burief in a bunch of gold chaibs     Tyson Fury won every round
Horror show for Fury. Maybe hes shot?. And needs to retire? Francis gave him a great fight and most likely won due to knockdown thats a 2 point round. Which means fury had to win 7 to win fight. Draw was worst case.
fight with zhang, why don't you do it
Tyson Fury, the greatest of all time.
Robbed.
What a joke
Definitely rigged fight, Francis owned that fight.
They should fight till sois knocked out. Decision sucks in boxing
La pelea la ganó Frsncis ngano
francis for sure worked him, however it also looks like fury thought he was going to be a walk in the park and didnt train as hard either as he shouldve have or as hard as he normally does. idk id love to see the fran vs fury 2
Francis won
The heavyweight division is now trash
Bad Refree bad judgement
Ngannou, forget about the MMA you can make more money fighting the top 10 boxing heavyweights and can be completely retired in three years with multi millions of dollars. You can fight Anthony Joshua - Deontay Wilder - Zhiley Zhang  and the list goes on and on. Do like Canelo Alvarez and fight every 4 or 5 months.
Fury cheated should of lost with that elbow n got knocked down
Dana White destroyed everything in sight this night 😂😂😂
He didn’t flash anything at the end either
See when Fury can’t use His size and has someone strong enough to throw Fury off of Him and throw Him around some HE becomes very average if Fury didn’t have that huge weight advantage HE is a average fighter
The knockdown came cause Fury thru the same jab straight right combination twice in a row and got caught in between the second time with the left hook landing before the right hand could land really good awareness from Francis
They robbed that man!
T Fury is fn DIRTY, How many fn times do we have to watch him throw an elbow into someones face just becuz he's desperate and losing the match. And never gets penilized
Fury was out of shape keep it real😅
Robbed.  Great fight Francis.
How can I take this seriously after that decision?
Robbed😢
Tyson furry lost that fight
He did win that fight
France’s won.🥇
I’d fall to if theirs a chance at another 50 million
The thing that amazes me is the hard hits he took and just shook 'em off. That elbow alone would have floored most. Heart of a champion.
Everyone so impressed with eating that elbow......that elbow was not intentionally thrown, by a man that doesnt throw elbows normally, with grease on Francis' face and head unlike UFC and it was a glancing blow at best.   Did he eat it? Yes. But it was glancing with other mitigating factors that would lessen its force.
F*ck the score cards we all know who won 🇨🇲🤴🏿
Francis Won
If they have a rematch Francis is going to have a tough time. Doubt fury took the fight too seriously
He should have dodged that elbow
Tyson won the fight but Francis won the night
Fury is like Homer Simpson when he was a boxer lol. Just a sloppy mess and only winning by being able to take hits. Just an all around terrible boxer with the ability to withstand big hits.
Robbed
All these fighting company’s needa step tf up with there judges
If you don't think this fight was rigged your delusional
You know it's just about the money when you got billionaires on your corner,smh. Francis won this fight all day! By the way....
The only crossover event that has to happen now is belal vs wilder in boxing🥊🥊
Man got robbed so hard I actually can’t believe it lol
*Francis Ngannou highlights. The real fight was much more one sided Fury's way
Bro got elbowed
I do think Tyson was the better boxer Ngannou was the better fighter
Francis won
I want to see Francis box more
this is robbery without Violence ,
Wow two amazingly talented fighters! Francis looked great! Shout out to Mike Tyson’s training! Very impressive
Tyson would whoop the dog mess outta Fury!
Theres no way fury won that.
that elbow wasn't really a major elbow anyway, and the niganou dude was way too slow.  THEND. FURY still undefeated.
Francis took the elbow like “I’m use to these things!” 😂
No Way FURY DID NOT WIN THAT.SPORTS IZ RIGGED TO PAY THE LEAST BETTED ON. ANYWAY FURY GOT HIS WIG KNOCKED OFF. THERE MUST BE A PART2
Hopefully they can rematch a 12 rounder
❤❤❤
Take notice people, you are witnessing the birth of a boxing icon.
Fury fighting dirty,clearly outmatched and gets the decision.  Bookmakers blackmailing judges.
This was rigged
They didn’t want Francis to make a historical moment
Tyson fury won in my opinion for sure. But he couldn’t even knockdown Francis, Francis won plenty of rounds and scored a flash knockdown against fury. None of that was suppose to happen. Fury should’ve dominated 🤷🏽‍♂️ yet showed really nothing honestly just barely edged it out trying to force the knockout on Francis without really giving it his all like he did in the wilder fights. Styles make fights I guess
The great champ nganou won!!! Awesome 😊😊😊
Robbery wow
tyson elbowed him, got knocked down , and somehow still won the fight     rigged
Tyson lost
The Gypsy was feeling the desperation Im thinking that why the elbow attempt
Fury is a madman to take clean shots from that roided up guy 🤯
Was paid and bought Tyson had no doubt he'd win decision
Robbed
Why was this only 10 rounds?
how francis lost 🫠
Can’t believe he elbowed him. Blatant cheating. Pretty much lost all respect for fury bc of that
Once again, Fury with the dirty tactics. That  was the most obvious, intentional elbow ever.
Fury back at it again! The king stands!!!
Very close fight but Tyson won because Challenger needed to show without a doubt but he at least deserves a rematch.
Fury lost.
He didn't do anything Mike Tyson train him to do
If Ngannu would loosen up and throw fast explosive jabs more often I could see him being unstoppable he just looked a bit heavy footed and not very fluent
Tyson is so fat
How TF did he lose? There's definitely a race thing going on with the judges. Nganou knocked him and did the most damage threw out the fight
The jelly on tyson in slow motion clips is the only thing furious about him. That jelly shook fiercely on that first slo mo clip looks like it had bacon since an hour ago at least….better feed that jelly more or its gona keep pullin you down like that……Tyson chicken is more like it. Boy got more jelly than destiny’s child. He looks like that one beach where all the walruses go to mate, what is it called again? I think its called the fatfuck island or sumthin? Idk I failed geography bcuz I was busy learning about things that matter instead
Francis won that fight
No idea why Fury won from these HL's
Bs.. fury lost the fight the boxing judges werent gonna let an mma guy beat their champ
Can we all say cheaterrrssss
U can tell tyson fury outta shape
I score it 1 knockdown to 1 illegal elbow. Clearly Ngannou won this fight. Boxing needs to anoint a better champion quick or these MMA guys are going to keep embarrassing you.
How many millions dide the judges make i hope they are investigated
Mike Tyson needs to work on ngannou’s punch accuracy because a better fighter can catch him on his left cheek whenever he wants to. He punches 1 punch at a time. No combinations. He has power.
Tuff🎉
Dont think it would go the same way if it's a rematch Fury would be more prepared Fury skillful even tho he got knocked down he rise back up right away Francis did better then Wilder did would have been nice if he got a K.O
Francis did win tho
even the saudis arent safe from corruption
I like how fury reacted to his knock down.. he didnt want to admit he got hit clean. He said he got hit in the back of the head when really, got clupped clean 😅
What heart.
What? What?
Ngannou hit him so hard that Fury's back fat vibrated.  We all know who won.
How is an out of  shape  dude still a winner after getting knocked down?
Rigged
94-95 was a joke,  perhaps it was oil money or whatever setup
Crazy no one gave the Notorious one a good justification against Mayweather. Fury didn’t even train for this fight lol
Such a robbery man hit him with a whole elbow wrong damage done
He got robbed...
You can Argue that Tyson fury won but the Fact that we’re even having a Debate on who won a MMA Fighter THATS NEVER BOXED BEFORE AND CAME FROM A INJURY THAT PUT HIM OUT FOR 2 YEARS VS ONE OF IF NOT THE BEST HEAVYWEIGHT OF THIS GENERATION IS INSANE
rigged fr
He won corrupt sport 🫡
Fury lost by a mile. No wonder I haven't seen or heard anything about this fight for the last two weeks.
Francis won that. They did him dirty
It's hilarious that one of the supposed best heavyweight boxers in history essentially lost to a boxer in his first professional fight.  I relatched every round & scored it and there is no way anyone but a corrupt judge would score it for Fury.  But even if you accept the corrupt scoring, this one of the "greatest of all times" lost to a guy in his first professional boxing match.  Too funny.
Did tyson ever knock down Francis? How tf did tyson get decision??????
Nganou did better than Wilder and Wilder has been training all his life while Nganou just started in boxing.😆😂😂😂😂
Tyson fury can take a lot of sledge hammer hits and still only come out with a single bruise!💀 whoever made that comparison is wrong clearly😂
Rigged
Apple versus pineapple fighting they funny
Judges couldn't let a non boxer be the champ after one fight
boxing scoring favors people who do no damage but just defend and get little taps on their opponent, its like competition tae kwon do
If they fight again, Francis has it.
y'all cheated that Francis Ngannou  out of that belt
Rigged 😳
The match was fixed and we all saw it. I am sure the Saudis try to clean the image of their country at the expense of everyone willing to take a big payday. Not my place, but let's focus on this man. This man got deported many times, but kept chasing his dreams. He defeated a boxing juggernaut, all while keeping his dignity.
So Tyson lost to a non professional boxer and because of the "integrity of the business" ? Foh all sports are rigged now
I always believed in Ngannou, I’m 16 now , I remember seeing him when I was super young and now seeing him get robbed vs Tyson fury is amazing
that ref was def paid what he doing worried about francis and not counting
That was BS
Nice Hook
Still undefeated the guy in a very bad shape, that was knocked down in the fight, use the elbow and almost get knocked out was the winner by split decision. He did not take this fight seriously but that almost got him knocked out.
Bro that left hook was a textbook counter Mike Tyson training him so well I’m proud of what he’s become and I’m happy he’s finally getting paid what he’s suppose to
Francis beating fury is insane
Fixed.  Tyson should have lost that fight.  Shady.
Ah poor black guy lost ,😢
Rigged, boxing is rigged .
Robbery hands down
If that's what a champ looks like I don't want it 1:52 can't even look the man in the eye lol
Fury is by far the most embarrassing heavyweight ever. He looks sloppy and he let a non boxer put him on the canvas in a prime time matchup smh lame
Ngannou won, Tyson was fighting a bit dirty
Francis was the strongest many physically Fury has felt, Francis was stronger and Fury did not know how to deal with someone he couldn't push around with his size and weight.
🤬🤬🤬
BOXING is fake! FRANCIS SHOULD ABSOLUTELY WON! IT WAS A SETUP!
I need a rematch but i dont know if we will get it
Fury should be embarrassed.
dude had to legit fight to keep his belt
I’m not trynna say it’s rigged but Tyson had that look like he knew he was gonna win it even after hearing Francis got the first card makes me wonder
Francis was robbed of this win.
Ive seen WAYY too many people that dont even watch boxing acting like experts. Its painfully obvious who those people are. The count only starts when a fighter goes to the corner. Thats why it took 4 seconds for tyson to get up but 22 seconds for the match to begin again. Also tyson won majority of the rounds  Thank you to all the real knowledgeable people educating others on the rules because 99% of people ive seen debating online dont even know about that rule
I think Tyson Fury & Gordon Ramsay should have a bout...Their friends, Gordon has a boxing background..be a good moneymaker.
Bull @$%!
So the guy with the busted up face “won” against the dude with a face that doesn’t even have a bruise or scratch… rigged
Big big respect Francis
I felt " Mcflurry" won, but not by much. It was close, but decisive.
How did Francis lose when he scored a knockdown Tyson is just to sketchy for me to like
It’s like Don King had a hand in this. The 2 judges were watching another fight! Francis beat Fury he knocked him down!!
And still!!!! 😂😂. Haytas 😂
THAT'S BS! THAT'S WHY I HATE BOXING 🥊!!!! FRACIS CLEARLY WON!!!!!
Fkng Arab they scary as fck 😳 if this was USA citizen he should 🏆 ✌️
It's a Barnum Bailey World as phoney as can be.
Fury needs to tone it up a bit looking a little flabby
I didn't see one highlight from fury that looked like he deserves that win.. this man CLEARLY LOST
Francis shocked everyone man. His power real, wilder still punches harder thoguh
We all know Francis won the fight
That elbow
So…..rematch?
Bull
I like how he ate that elbow and kept working. he was unphased and his preparation showed 🔥
I'm a MMA, and I started boxing when I was 10 years old. After reviewing the video this boxing match looks  fake to me!!! Think about it, how can a guy who hasnt been consistently in the boxing circuit all of a sudden fight the Heavy Weight Champ of the World.
How does a man that never got knocked down lose any of her elbow and people didn’t get no points taken off
Tyson fury really lost that fight
Elbow should have been another point deducted fury loss clearly
That hype man sounds like he’s on ludes 🤣
Ngannou won
Huh??
Judge 2 is blind af
This rigged asf and also racist af FUCK THE SPORTS ENTERTAINMENT
We all know who won
Oh my God please tell me nobody believes that first punch that he thrown at knocked him down was it real because it was fake I hope everybody knows that
TYSON FURY INTENTIONALLY THREW THAT FIGHT! THE FIGHT WAS RIGGED!! He didnt have his gloves on all the way, and he threw the fight! He intentionally missed punches! THE FIGHT WAS RIGGED!
Luser
Looks good to see beyond that
Hella got robbed 😂😂 but love the entertainment 🔥
I wonder what that Arab said to Francis at the last few seconds of the video with his finger in Francis face. “Probably like don’t say shit about the fight being fixed you know your getting paid good boy”😂😂
He was robbed... Good fight. He lasted the whole fight and knocked Fury down! Tyson is a great coach. Damn split decision! Enjoyed it...
I guess he needed a knockout to win the fight
Wow! Francis did his thing , thing against a high tex fighter.  Even though Francis was robbed. It still was a good fight.
Robbery
Fury is such a dirty fighter in my opinion idk why he gets praised so much
Looks like a fun fight…why are people acting like the guy who fought the champ and lost got robbed when most people and judges agree? Just accept it and look for a rematch. People must think Tyson cheats or gets lucky every fight.
Tyson fury is a bum, a paper champion!! Hes a paper champion give me 90 days i will fight him an win easy
TYSON ZELENOFF AKA FURY ZELENOFF AKA THE FURY ZELENOFF LEGACY FAMILY TREE OF BOXING😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Look tyson face hahahahahahaha
Fury lost.
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT, "AND IM A DIE HARD FURY FAN" WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING BY NOT BEING IN SHAPE FOR THE FIGHT AFTER THIS? BRO, YOU DIDINT EVEN LOVE US ENOUGH TO GET READY😭😭😭😭😭. JUST BECAUSE IT WAS NOT A TITLE FIGHT DOESN'T MEAN YOU DONT PREPARE 😢..  ALL THAT SHIT YOUR POPS TALKS ABOUT "NOW HE CAN CALL HIMSELF A REAL BOXER" SHIT IS DOWN THE DRAIN BRO. A REAL BOXER WORKS OUT BECAUSE HE LOVES HIMSELF AND HIS PEOPLE. YOUR PEOPLE ARE YOUR PEOPLE. YOUR REAL FAMILY IS YOUR REAL FAMILY 😢. IF NOT FOR US WHO ARE YOUR PEOPLE, AT LEAST DO IT FOR YOUR REAL FAMILY 😢. BEING A "REAL BOXER" as we all know, IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE A PERSON WHO WORKS THE FUCK OUT.          HOODY OVER YOUR FUCKEN HEAD AND RUN MOTHER FUCKER!!!
That elbow was a receipt for the punch to the back of the head in round 3
That’s bull shit he got him with the elbow that 💩 was rigged 🖕🖕
How are you going to have a highlight video and show two clips? 😅 why don’t you show Tyson winning the majority of the rounds… and on top of that all you showed was Tyson accidentally elbowing him 😅 fuckin ESPN
Francis is just one of those people who can train in any sport long enough, he will be able to at least semi-hang with the best lol probably not nfl or nba but you know what i mean lol
Ngannou is the embodiment of the perfect specimen, he’s a weapon
Don’t get me wrong I love UFC more than boxing but Tyson won this fight fair and square
Mad respect to Iron Mike Tyson, a total genius whom I respect. With ideas like this Iron Mike Tyson will always be rich. Tyson Fury faught " a black" and "cameroon." Cameroon was once a UFC champ, where is its professional boxing resume. Oh bologna. Tyson Fury fight a real professional boxing champ with real titles...coo Mike Tyson, nice mansion brother.
Francis got robbed big time
Boxing or NBA which is more rigged?
They know he lost
sorry, fury lost
Tyson Fury and Tommy Fury both lost their fights back to back. These judges need to be fired, clearly somethings going on.
They robbed him of a win, how do you get your head punched off and still win? Lool
Man, the boxing fanbase has really gone downhill. Every close fight must be a robbery, it's always racism, boxing is politics, can't yall just chill tf out?
That's exactly why pro boxing is in the toilet right now and YouTubers are getting more views than actual pro boxers because of BS like this he got robbed for that boxing match everyone knows it just because fury was favored in the fight I'm assuming this is just from what I can see they robed Ngannou
Wow even fury was surprised by that hook
Trash decision!
I will never gamble or watch boxing again. Shit is rigged. Those last two judges should be in jail
What a dirty cheap from Tyson I respect the champs but when you go on elbow someone in boxing ring
He IS the people’s champ!
If you paid to watch this crooked sport you are dumb as a box of rocks.  NO WAY Francis would be give a decision.  WBC is arguably the most crooked entity on earth ...right next to our Federal Government.  Now ....they will do anything into convincing you to PAY AGAIN.  Idiots.
Fury lost fucc the judges
Ngannou should IMMEDIATELY make the jump to pro boxing!!!!   sweep up the titles along with 5-600 millon dollars and just kick back.   hes a BAD BAD man!
that elbow was an old school gypsy move.   he knew he was getting beat.    and look at francis' face in the later rounds!!!   holy crap!!!!!  ive never seen anything that scary since TYSON TYSON!!!!
That man lost 😂😂😂
Tyson lost
thats foul they robbed him
We all know who eon that fight. And that second judge must be Tysons grandmother 🤦🏿‍♂️. Buuuut i always say if you just kttfo you never have to worry about the judges
That's Mike Tyson's left hook all the way
Tyson Fury is a good boxer and is getting old
Seems like a bad decision, but that's also thr nature of judging. Can call it crooked, whatever maybe. But humans have different perceptions. I love Fury and his general sportsmanship though.  I also love how he can get his clock rung and get up like that each time. That one with Wilder was awesome. You can see the life breathe back into him. Even if he had officially lost i dont think he would have been upset, Francis gave him a legit run for his money.
“Highlights”
Tyson should get in shape.
Francis could've knocked Tyson out and they still would've found a way to make Tyson the winner.
We knew that the only way for FN is to knock Tyson out.
ngonue vs wilder
Francis won that clear as day 😂
Frances was robbed racist lowlife bstards
96-93 Fury — 🤦🏻‍♂️
Just a good old fashion Aryan masterclass in White Power.  Big dumb black Goliath just wasn't smart enough for the white man
Francis did better than Wilder 😂
Fury lost three times in this match. 1. knocked down 2. illegal elbow to face 3. failed to beat mma fighter in his own game
They giving him these victories because he the great white hype
This is pitiful
I like Fury but he looked shitty here
Jelly belly
He kissed that man cuz he knew he lost 😂
Nah he got robbed
It’s cuz he ex ufc
A ton of respect from both of those men! My fav type of fights. No one trying to show each other up
Rematch man
UFC he would got on top of him and won
francis ate that elbow like a cookie
Good highlights that hook? Knocked out lesser men
Crap, fire the judges
Wonder if Fury knew that Francis hits harder than Wilder
Fury is a disgrace to the whole division. Filthy, filthy, classless man.
Bruh recently all these fights are being robbed, yes I understand these are legends and I love them but everyone has to lose there’s always a bigger fish and there will always be a new generation of better fighters
Ngannou keeps training right. He will be the next mike tyson.
How the hell can Fury be the only one knocked down in the fight and still win? I’m calling that a Fix…
How did Fury call Francis fat? Fury is the most out of shape boxer I’ve ever seen besides Butterbean.
Rateros le robaron el cinturón era para Francis.
This guy has averaged wilder 😂😂
Fury making dad bods feel like they can box lol
I don't know... Boxing is solo politics... So imagine a fight like this, a gimmicky, money fight.   I can only imagine what goes on behind closed doors.   Totally a set-up fight.
You could tell he was fighting the instinct to jump on top of him for the ground and pound
Robbery.🔫🤚🏾🤚🏾🏃
Yeah 👍 we No who really won that fight...??? I don't even need to say...??? Jus saying
Great fighters and a great fight. NO ONE wil ever  underestimate Francis again.  Fury thought he could coast on him but now the secret is out!
We know who's the real winner
Tyson Fury lost. F@$& them judges. In a   real WBC Boxing match like Mayweather and Tank, Fury would have lost and had a point taken for that dirty elbow. Fury definitely should have lost the first fight against Wilder. I give Fury props for actually beating Wilder the second fight fair and square.
Never boxed before and beat the undisputed champ
This fight was robbed paid by somebody to cheat
Tyson is the best heavyweight to ever come around besides a few more but being the best there is makes you a the best trainer there is so they're pretty good Mike Tyson congratulations I know if it wasn't for you he will not gone therefore you are looking at the next heavyweight champ of the world Tyson keep training and I know he's going places
This fight was stolen ,  Francis won this fight
Wow. Francis got robbed, based on these highlights. Freaking aye
Who ever score it 96-93 fury was def payed that’s nuts this whole highlights was Francis dominating this man
Once again rigged
Clearly the legendary Tyson as cornerman adds  +5 to confidence  +5 to strength  + 5 to boxing skill
Round 2 is gonna be like  Fury (but he is taking the fight seriously Round 1)  Vs  Ngannou (but he had more practice and isn’t in his debut match)
Who won wow that’s interesting
Fury lost That fight.
Last Boxing 🥊 match I ever watch … Shit is Rigged
Worst boxing match I've ever seen....this isn't boxing anymore this is clown shit....I'm done....I rather watch girl boxing... Tyson is a hump
Terrible, Terrible. What happened, to the old saying . " MAY THE BEST MAN WIN " Exactly why 🥊 🥊 is Dead and gone . He was robbed.
Boxing is fake💯
Fury looked horrible
Fury is a great champion
Ngannou needs to dispute the fact he was clearly elbowed and no point was ever taken. That could’ve been the match
Those highlights seemed biased based on who won. That or the judges got straight paid lol. Also, benefit of coming from mma - that elbow was probably like a cup of coffee for him.  Eats that for breakfast lol
Are you kidding me wtf why and how does fury keeps getting damn near knocked out but they always got him winning Francis literally beat this man and lost this 💩 is unreal
Mma is a father of protection and boxing is a child of protection and easy to beat in real fight
Oh you are a wrestler now...
Ngannou won by might, but Tyson won by favor. Good to serve God 🙏
That is bullshit
mafias money was on tyson, they never loose
Wow i just lost respect for boxing
Sir Francis got robbed it’s all good the truth need doesn’t need to be defended🙌❤️Fury still one of the Goats of course If Ngannou had Mike Tyson’s old fury he would slice through the heavyweight division with ease…💯
Casual fan with not much knowledge in boxing  But god almighty. I think Ngannou did better than anyone could have expected   Well, anyone but MMA fans
They cheated Ngannou, he won not Fury. That's what happens when you fight in a Foreign country
The sun shines on a dogs ass every now and then. Francis got lucky, he is gonna need it if he ever fights JonJones
So 8 seconds of actual highlights for a 10 round fight? And people wonder why boxing is dead.
Francis is Warrior Champion
More of an mma fan than boxing these days since boxing has gone down hill. That being said, Im a big Tyson Fury fan. His story is incredible, all he overcame and the awareness he brought to mental health. All that being said he looked straight up fat and sloppy and out shape here. Francis very well may have won and its embarrassing. He should be ashamed of himself. Im a huge MMA fan and am in no way diminishing Francis. Francis has real skills, and of course we all know his power is other worldy. I just think we shouldn't overlook how absolutely embarrassing this is for Tyson as a professional. He should have more pride than this. For a guy with such slick boxing skills, footwork, range, height, length...all these tools . He performed like an absolute nobody.
Wait but Tyson didn’t have any highlights how did he win
Tyson fury insists that he was hit on the back of the head. That is a lie. Just watch the video footage. He was hit on the SIDE of the head, which is completely legal.
fury should be embarrassed
In my Opinion:  Round 1: Fury Round 2: Fury Round 3: Ngannou  Round 4: Ngannou  Round 5: Fury Round 6: Ngannou Round 7: Ngannou  Round 8: Close…but Fury Round 9: Ngannou  Round 10: Fury  Ngannou scored a knockdown Fury should have lost a point from the elbow.  Ngannou is the New Heavyweight Chanpion of the World
Boxing is bullshit, all a scam and money talks. How this mighty sport has fallen 😢
waste of time. pathetic performance from both rigged contenders. Ppl are rlly stupid if they think any boxing match of mma match or even sports is real anymore. Colliseum anyone? dumbasses.
Dana saying boxing is dead and not letting his fighters cross over or give them high pay. Dude literally manipulates his fighters like Sean o maley . Dude is literally begging boxers for a fight so he can run to Dana and be like “here see we can make something happen”  Dana is that girl in a relationship where she has an onlyfans account and tells you she isn’t showing her body off. Yea okay dummy
Need a second fight best fight in a while…
I give ngannu only a 10-8 on the 3rd round and a 10-9 on the 8th....the rest for fury !!!...ngannu was just practically standing there not much action most of the time......if only he had the pacquiao killer instinct on the 3rd he might have had finished tyson........twas twas like when ugas had the same chance to finish spence in the 6th round of their match.....instead both ngannu and ugas lost those opportunities......allowing their opponents the breather to recover.....!
Rigged dog shit
Fury has a great chin. Wilder knocked him down a total of 4X during their fights & Fury got up every single time. I think Fury got lucky on this decision
Steroids > skill
He’s drunk and on coke
Idk why UFC stars go to boxing for more fame when It should be boxing stars trying out the real world (UFC) for more fame
All these ufc fighters going to box…I’m tryna see a boxer get in the cage man💯🥱
96 to 93 idiot needs to be banned from boxing how do you come up with that BS??????
George St Pierre once said that Joe Rogan has the hardest kick he's ever felt/seen. Francis's right hook came in at the exact same power has Joe's kicks. Let that sink in for a second.
With Jesus on your side you can’t lose even when you lose!😂
Wilder is gonna think the fight was fixed.
Even Tyson fury knew he lost. You can tell by his facial expression when they announced he was the winner
Fury lost that fight. Anyone who trains could tell you that.
Mike Tyson 😂 had his hands on this....they buck him frfr dude learn alot from the goat
Francis is him tho he’s amazing he’s insane
Didn't realize it at first, but Francis little dance after the knockdown was cold and sick as fuck. I also think it was his little subtle way in the ring saying to Tyson if this was an MMA fight you'd be dead right now.
All sports are rigged. Look at Mayweather.
I wonder how much They made on this fight Ngannou deserves a big payday, Fury too!
HAHAHA Francis barely noticed that elbow. I bet Tyson put force behind it too.  Dude probably took worse elbows in the octagon. Any boxer would’ve cried about it
With regards to Fury decision win,Fury  U are Peter Mckinnely!!! Pizza guy and  a very big fat silly-face east Boston resident!
“Catches him off guard” biased ahh commentators
even if they had given ngannou the belt, he couldn't even defend it vs a journeyman. Gerald washington would knock him out
ngannou did not outbox fury, he did not win this fight for all the idiot casuals saying how "good" ngannou did, youre exaggerating go watch the full fight ngannou won at most 4 rounds, rd 4 was a swing this was not a robbery fury has been knocked down many times, he's chinny so its not that surprising to see him get caught by a big juiced up idiot who swings wildly, not much skill involved ngannou suks dik as a boxer and mma fighter, only has power and size to win fights fury isnt great either, he's a chubby 7ft egg with spindly arms and legs and no chin or real skill, relies on stupid herky jerk showboating and constant holding he needs to retire back to the cocaine and donut kingdom after usyk boxes his head off but fury simply won more rounds than ngannou, outboxed him yeah ngannou had the size and power to pressure fury and keep him timid, even knocked him down, but never did much else with it it would be one thing if he knocked fury out but he didnt even do what he's known for send his gorilla asss back to the congo
Tyson looking like a bag o’ milk
Leave it to a Muslim to fuck everything up.
Bullshit judges... so sad.
Everybody know furry lost that fight come on now
When the highlights are 15 seconds 👀 🤔
10,,000 bucks Mike Tyson set that up for him to lose    Just to give him a little bit of humbleness
Bullshit ass sneaky elbow by fury they robbed ngannou
They say Francis hits like a cat hitting you at 60mph. That's 1 hard punch!!
Fury is a disgrace. Thought he was taking an easy pay and got whipped by a day-1 boxing rookie. What a joke. The gypsy clown 🤡
What a joke
Francis is a beast ..
Robbed ,money talks I guess!!!
If this match took place in the US... Francis would've won.
You get knocked down and still win...fuckin politics!
He definitely won with the knock down that truly was the difference maker but hey when u the minority what do you think was going to happen (A fixed outcome) such a joke in boxing it shouldn't even be a sport anymore PERIOD
More proof that boxing is full of s*** like this out of shape as boxer
Tyson fury is built like jello
Tyson knows he lost this fight and the world does too, just goes to show that the judges who gave Tyson Fury the win were bias in their judging this match.💯🫡
They robbed Francis
He got Rob
Francis is pound for pound the baddest man on earth
Side note* FUCK DUBAI AND SAUDI ARABIA 😁
Ngannou should have won that one.
Grreat fight!! Fury's speedy combinations won him the fight against the strong Ngannu ^_^
Fury is the champion of donuts maybe
Boxing: the only sport where one guy can clearly win, and actually gets elbowed on purpose by his opponent, but still lose 😂
hahhaha Moth Fkin Gypsty King… The F Ing Winner … Respect .
Francis was robbed so hard
Fury lost 100%, this shows how unfair the world is
Robbery!!! This is an effing robbery!!! No way!!! No way did fury!!! Coming from a Tyson fury fan this is a complete robbery!!!
Robbed!
Yall forget ngsnnou has the power of a semi going 40mph
Everyone wants to point out the elbow from Fury, but no one is mentioning the illegal punching while holding that Ngannou was doing.
Why was this fight only 10 rounds
Shits rigged asf
Fury won clear as day
Can we talk about how ESPN showed about 3 highlights and nothin else? Booooorrrring.
Fury's just a sack of blubber.
What a joke, they post all Fury highlights basically.
Tyson has to lose the rematch by default.. js
Do people actually think Tyson fury is a good boxer???😂😂😂😂
1:50. Seemed like a fake celebration.  One arm up.  Had to have it held up.  No emotion.
Boxing is trash nowadays
And he elbowed him
They were never gonna let an mma fighter to win Even tho he landed less punches he sure did the most damage and had the only knock down. And tyson even landed an illegal elbow. Francis ngannou was definitely cheated
U know he won if bob was standing next to him after fight like that in  Aww of him
Def rigged by the way fatboy was acting at the end
Francis got robbed
It’s not a robbery, boxing is just a shit sport.
Like wat kinda workout does this man do I never saw a heavyweight boxer built like a soup sandwich even butter bean looked more in shape
This is why people stopped watching boxing we know who one it was not fury
Ladys and gentlemen may i introduce the new mike tyson
Does being fat help you box better?  I don't understand how tyson os considered a professional athlete looking like that.
give us Francis vs Deontay
robbed at gun point
I don't know everybody thinks hes the champion hes always cheating hes a glove grabbing elbow throwing cheater.
It's amazing. He is every bit the more worthy successor to thw Gypsy King, but becausr boxing is at the mercy of mafia betting they gave it to the guy who got tf beat out of him. Disgusting sport.
Anyone else see how his eyes started rolling to the back of his head, after taking the elbow. Then immediately rolled right back like "nahhhh"…mans a tank🦾😂
Judges need to be fired bruh
Yeah we need part 2
This is some BS
One of the biggest robberies in boxing history
Fury relies on a couple things to his advantage. One he like to use his height and weight to lean on opponents and wear them down.  Two, virtually all of his offense is set up w feints.  Ngannou didn’t budge when fury feinted w the jab; and outmuscled him in the clinch.
When one man can barely see straight, and the other looks like he could go 5 more rounds- it's clear who the victor is. If it's possible to win in this sport while in that situation- than this sport is a joke.
Francis won this fight ?
Tyson was fighting different than he usually does but that's what you get for underestimating somebody
Shit look staged
Rematch definitely needed and how did a judge go 96-93 for fury the only knockdown in the fight
Crock of shit. Tyson literally fell on his ass lmao. And was dazed. In a real fight Francis would of literally ended his life there. No other time did tyson do such to Francis. He did land more hits I saw though.. just they didn't phase Francis. Sooo.
How tf he won that fight bruhhh?
Why isnt anyone talking about how boring this fight was???
Ngannous reaction was the fastest I’ve seen someone go from shock to fuck it whatever. He probably knew this would happen
WHAT THE HECK
Forehand I had no idea that Francis even had a chance. But, to absolutely win this fight, and get robbed clearly exposes boxing’s shady politics.
Fury definitely won it.... but impressed by ngannou
It looks scripted
There's no doubt that Fury is a great fighter. Did he win this one? IDK. What i do know is he looks awful physically.
So you can get knockdown , throw an illegal elbow and still win ?! Imagine betting on this man just to be robbed
How did fury win even with the elbow??
Look at the stats punching landing, Tyson, won that match
This was like watching old Mike Tyson, little glympses of him in his form, that training did REALLY good.. Tyson should full time coach and NGannu fight seriously in boxing
0:14
0:05
I bet Tyson Fury felt like Apollo Creed at the end of Rocky.
Boxing is RIGGED
He got beat up periodt he's so sloppy he's done✌🏽
Robbery
That some s
crazy how fury was the one doing mma in there
Robbery.
Francis knocked him down and caught an elbow he definitely won what ever
Nganou won by those highlights. Wish I woulda watched it though
Francis had this fight regardless I don’t care
two monsters
Robed him
Corruption corruption it’s disgusting
Tyson really lost
I don't really know why everyone is so surprised about Ngannou doing so well. Sure, he's not a boxer, but he *is* the UFC heavyweight champ. He already has all of the tools he needs to do the work, he just needs time to adjust to the job.
Tyson fury is built like a meat ball with two toothpicks for legs.
That look on furys face when he hit the mat, francs earned his respect.
I'm surprised Tyson didn't uppercut himself again. lol
Tyson fury cheated what's with the elbow hit not a fan of that
So is Francis now the baddest man on the planet?
And people still don't believe sports is rigged & racism don't exist anymore. Tyson Fury clearly lost this fight & they still gave it to him. I wonder why🤔
Fight Wilder next.
Fury should have been DQd after that elbow smh what an embarrassing performance from the world "champ"
Everyone with a brain knows Francis win this fight. Tyson Fury’s brotherhood had to bail him out of that one lol.
You know the judges were racist
How tf did he lose, he had a knockdown. The fuck is this bs
Wack decision, Francis won regardless of what those corrupt judges say, I’ve watched this fight 4 times and Tyson put up a great fight but he lost! 👎
I love Fury my favorite boxer but i think he lost this one 😢
Robbery
Biggest rob of all time. Well expect for that ref in the late 90s early 200s
There's always a time where someone Good will lose. You seen what happened to Ronda Rousey.
Boy have the mighty have fallen.
Eh looks to me like fury got rocked ..
Tyson fury wasnt the aggressive fighter, elbows ngannou, and gets knocked down in the 3rd, and still wins? What the hell?
They cheated buddy fury was done n the elbow
He might hit harder then wilder jus saying but that would be a crazy fight cuz wilder hits harder then fury but the way wilder got beat up shit that would be a good fight to see salute Francis
Rigged
What a disgrace , dirty dirty dirty .mad props to Francis a real one 👍whooped that trolls arse.
I know it's kind of his thing, but Fury looked flabbier than usual. Hope it was a big payday for both. And what fight was that second judge watching?
This is why we don't watch boxing anymore decisions based on opinion not facts
I love Fury, but he is the most out of shape looking in-shape guy on earth. I love watching his fights. Fury is AWESOME!!!!
We all know that Francis is the real winner, regardless of the two Judges who cheated for Fury! You made us proud Ngannou, You are the real Champion!
That’s so much BS !!!
Ngannou won that match and did very well!!!!
Hell nah Francis landed way more counter shots in there exchanges lol
Hi Hi won on his ass
That judge needs to go to prison. We just watched a man fight his very first professional boxing match against the world champion, and win. Robbery is a crime, and prison is the punishment. It was a good fight and I'm a fan of tyson fury. However that was clear and simple, no way in this life that fury won the fight. Francis went from being 1400 underdog, to being the favorite in the final round, per las vegas odds. Every person that knows boxing, how to score it, etc, all of them are saying Francis got robbed. I couldn't agree more. Happens wayyyy too often in combat sports. Have people that don't even know how to score the rounds, deciding who wins the fights. UFC is horrible for that shit. Boxing is just straight up corrupt as shit. Has been since I've been alive. This fight here, is a prime example of why the viewership on boxing is declining. It's corrupt, the refs are horrible(Francis gets elbowed in the face by tyson fury and ref doesn't even blink, same when they bump heads).
Didn’t see where Tyson won. Help me out. Did I miss something
Francis was robbed… rigged boxing.
Francis supposedly the hardest puncher CAP
Smh
Absolute BS ngannou won that  he got a knock down and fury elbowed his face they just want to protect the pride of boxing that a guy could train 4 months and beat their top heavyweight its all politics
Robbed smh
Ngannou won, I don't understand...
Correct me if I am wrong, but if you don't get the knock out, don't they decide fights based off how many punches you land vs the other person? I saw the stats on this and Tyson landed 31.8% and Francis 25.5% Total. If you want to say round by round, 7 out of 10 rounds was in favor of Fury. Idk how they treat knockdowns so someone can tell me in the comments, but based on just the statistics of it, Fury did deserve a win. If your opponent misses way more round to round than you and didn't get a knock out, I don't see how someone wins. It is like missing 80% of the questions on a test and getting mad that someone else has 80% correct on their test. Not saying it was a landslide, but I feel like people are putting too much stock on the knockdown and not seeing these stats.
I'd love to see Jon Jones and Ngannou  fight. Everyones starts screaming "JONES WILL DESTROY FRANCIS", you really don't know, it just depends on whose the better fighter on that night, in that arena. You don't really know until it happens. 100% of fighters were undefeated until they weren't. I really want to see that fight.
Tyson and Holyfield would knock him out
So the highlights are Francis and why he should have won? I understand that Fury getting beaten is bad for boxing but that was fixed.
This is so clearly a staged fight. Fury did everything he could to make Ngannou look good so they could make bank. But props to them both for putting on an exciting show and walking away with bags. (Seriously watch fury literally coachibg ngannou what to do and standing still waiting for him/giving him openings etc) and compare it to any of his last 6 fights. World of difference in how fury moves
Francis won that smh
Elbow? .. This looked bad for a WBC Heavyweight Champion
Francis won.
That was bs
Black man won regardless of what they say 💯
Francis Ngannou next fight should be.💰 :Deontay Wilder  :Anthony Joshua  :Andy Ruiz
I NEVER thought i would say this, but Fury was lucky to get the win over Francis. Not to take anything away from Francis, but it was obvious Fury did not truly see Francis as a threat. He came in extremely overweight, probably bc he thought he would easily out box Francis without any genuine threat of taking damage. The reason i say that is bc Tyson announces a quick turnaround fight with Usyk just days before his fight with Francis. I love how Francis showed the world that he can be the first guy in history to have real success in boxing from MMA.. Much respect to Francis!
daylight robbery
I don’t see no robbery here. I see a great but close fight. Ngonnau is very powerful and Fury got caught but yeah Gipsy King got up and got serious and won.
Sad, because of 1 biased judge.
They cheated for garbage ass fury!!!
Fury got his ass kicked!!!
Elbow Fury 💪🏻🐖
Wins by 1 pt & wasn't penalized for the  elbow to the back of Ngannon's head tells me that Tyson Fury actually LOST this fight
They're making a clown show out of boxing now. A guy with no experience boxing going to a decision with a heavyweight world champion. What the hell is going on? Should have never went to a decision, Fury should have destroyed him.
Francis clearly won this match  Fury was outclassed here and even the Fury family mannerisms indicated that. FURY even used illegal elbows and guillotines of which he should have been deducted massive points for they ignored
Huh?? Wtf
The only knockdown was by Nnganou
These announcers were all over Francis like he was Mike Tyson. I hate listening to bias announcers. Just call the fight, sheesh 🤦‍♂️
Francis got robbed. He beat the shit out of that tub of shit
Ngannou won.  Simple as that.
Nice 23 second count on that knockdown. Same thing Wilder complained about in the first fight, funny enough.
Idc what the scorecards said anyone can see Francis won
Rematch
Robbed
Rediculous! This is why boxing is a dying sport. Corruption
Ngannou got robbed
Looks like a pushed down to me
That was a good match
Ridiculously one sided hl.
Francis Won
Fury definitely lost
Who were the sheiks in the ring?
This some bs.
so he knocked him down, got elbowed in the face, but he lost?
Francis hit the rocky 1 on fury in real life
Imagine if fury worked out though. Ngannu wouldn’t be able to handle a yoked out 6’9 Viking. Mayne he will start taking his training more seriously going forward.
We all know who really won 😅
I would say that Francis did win they just couldn't wouldn't let that happen. Francis should have a rematch and go in there with more aggression to win and from the looks of it he can beat champ Fury 💪
That’s way better than mcgregor
Judges completely robbed Ngannou. Boxing isn’t even a real sport anymore. Completely rigged
Boxing keeps making excuses for Tyson saying "he didnt take Francis seriously" "he didnt train for the fight" "tyson carried francis". There are no excuses. Tyson Fury was on track to becoming the greatest heavyweight boxer in boxing history. Tyson shouldve been able to get out of bed and finish Francis the older fighter.   Boxing and mma fans don't understand how crazy this fight was regardless of the winner.   The mma equivalent of this fight would be if Canelo decided to fight Khabib in the octagon and on fight night wrestle fucks khabib for a couple rounds. All mma fans would be a little embarrassed and super shocked if the fight makes it past round 2.
all the sheiks lol
yooooo first time seeing the highlights and you cant tell me that elbow was not intentional. Fury mid punch changed the angle of his punch downward elbowing francis. Must be a boxing veteran move?
Naaah, Ngannou won that fight.
Very clear Ngannou was Robbed😡!
any normal person woulda been knocked out by FURYS first right hand. he put all his weight into it n ngannou isnt fased. THEN  NGANNOU hits tyson with a left that DOESNT have all his weight in it n down goes fury
Ngannou I really think you can beat them all
I love the one sided video this was lmfao 🤣 anything to make him look good
5 seconds of highlights? Lmao
How can you lose an even fight while having the only knockdown?  Completely rigged and bad for boxing
Give Francis another year to really train for pugilism. He’s gonna square away his issues with range and timing. And that monster right hand is gonna start landing clean over…..and over….and over.  Excited to see Ngannou’s career continue, the man is an inspiration.
What kind of highlight is this? half of it was the damn knockdown played over and over again and a random elbow shot... dudes getting lazy with these man 😂
I mean just look at fury's face omg just by looking at it it seems ngannou won
honestly think the judges were more than generous to Mr. Francis.
They really weren’t going to let a ufc fighter win, c’mon it would’ve looked really bad on boxing lol
It feels like racial problem at this point first ksi now ngannuo
Why do we keep watching this fake rigged bullshiit?? Is what we should ask ourselves
Fury is susceptible to the left hook like Larry Holmes. Thats how wilder knocked him down as well.
Cant wait to her Rogans take on his podcast
I’m soo happy i doing pay for this damn fight.  Tyson will now be ridiculed, even when you clearly lose, you win.
Robbed
Doubt the boxing federation would hand Tyson Fury his first loss in a exhibition match against a UFC fighter unless he got knocked out. Some people say Fury was knockout longer then 10 seconds
Ksi and Ngannou both got robbed by the fraud fury’s
That elbow was worth a point take away
That elbow was some bs 😮very unprofessional should have been fined
Ohh please…First of all, it’s soo obvious Fury wasn’t taking it seriously which he’ll even admit was a mistake, and regardless of what he says he definitely wasn’t in shape. If he would’ve taken it seriously and came in shape he would’ve destroyed Ngannou from the opening bell. Remember this : Tyson Fury is the last guy you want to give a second chance too.. Just ask Deontay Wilder ? We all know what happened in the 2nd fight with Wilder after they robbed Fury by calling the first fight a draw. When Fury prepared and came into that second fight against Wilder in shape, and with a purpose after all the shenanigans from the first fight along with the chatter Wilder & his team started-we all remember what Tyson Fury the world gets when he got something to prove. If I was Ngannou I would wait until one of those championship belts gets relinquished by Fury or Usyk, or until he could get a title shot against anyone other than Fury because if he ever gets in the ring with him again he’s gonna get SMASHED ! Mark my words and remember the date you read this !!!
That was definitely not fury in wilder shape. he probably thought it would be a cakewalk. wasn't. If fury gets in shape like he was 2nd 3rd wilder fight, nagnou going to sleep. Fury got to keep looking over his back and not get lazy like this or hes going to end up losing the belt. Close but fury obviously without a doubt outboxed him no problem. i will say this. the gypsy can take extremely heavy hits and still stand up after. FURY GET YOUR ASS IN SHAPE AND KEEP BEING THE WHITE BOY ON TOP DAMMIT!!!!!
Tyson didnt win that lol
Man just went againat one of the biggest threats in the sport for his debut and won the fan vote, brilliant fighter
racist world
Fury the go goat! Well deserved win
There was only 2 mins of good highlights in the whole thing??? What a chit fight lmfao
Just shows how rigged the fight system is, wish there were better decision makers.
Biggest robbery of the year
Ngannou is a real fighter. Took that elbow and didnt complain like some other boxers might
Wow, the word robbing runs the world because it is easy to rob an African and funny at the same time.
This fight is gonna be the spark for tyson to train hard for Usyk
Done with boxing since ain't nothing in the world fair no more.
Ngannou won the fight, he was robbed.
Fury!!!! Yes
Ppl forget at the end of the day. These mma fighters are athletes just like them (boxers) and train to fight. Not the same sport. It’s still fighting. He didn’t run through Francis like ppl thought.
This is just embarrassing for Tyson Fury
Homies a bag of sand
Back in the day, you had to bring it to take the championship from a true champion... With that said, in any close round, I'd score it for Fury. There were many close rounds, but it was typically Francis who started the round stronger, but Tyson finished off the round more active. I favored the champion in those rounds.   I had Fury 8 rounds to Francis 2 rounds.  However, on the very close rounds, if I was generous, it was 6 rounds to Fury and 4 rounds to Francis which still equated to a one-point win to Fury.  You don't take a championship for going the distance. I was going for Francis. It just seems more exciting if he wins. Yet, even in losing he won.  Fury not having any video of Francis boxing was the challenge... I don’t believe if they rematch, Francis will do much better. He is still limited and Fury will be able to study and shut down much of Francis's fight plan if they have another go-around.  Now, if Francis gets another half dozen fights, then that could change his experience level.  Possible Opponents: Parker, Ruiz, Joshua, Wilder, Ortiz, and Usyk  We will soon see.
You really can't judge who won based on this highlight reel. It was a long fight, and yes Ngannou had a third round knockdown, but Fury outboxed him the whole night. Ngannou didn't really throw that many punches.
Fury fucking lost man 🤬🤬🤬
When will boxing ever be clean??? 🤣🤣🤣 bullshit decision
Fury = bag o' milk
I just got warned my comments are inappropriate lmfao block me I don't give two shits about all this fake shit MFS
All they did is help eliminate boxing 😅
I'm not racist but he won cause he is white and cause boxing needs a reason to still exist 😮😮
World knows who really won that fight I agree boxing proved how fake it was anything to keep the sprt going lmao my dogs ass means more than that desission I won't watch fake shit nomre furry should got 50 cents for his ass whooping
Que problema este del boxeo gano con solo tener el apellido fury. Jajajajajajajajja
Espn as usual doesn't want to show the truth but instead just the bits where the black guy looks good and white guy doesn't which is factually super racist.
Those were the jugglers Highlights?? 2 or 3 good punches and an elbow😂
classic rigged decision
The highlight shows fury getting beat up but he wins??? Lmfaoooo yea rigged
They had to create that high$$$ rematch, but this time it may have backfired. ?do you win by punch count or total damage ….I say damage. Ngannou wins!
Highway Robbery 😮
Tyson seems to be out of shape boxing can be a serious physical sport anyway love Tyson Fury best of all to him
Bro emoted on him 😂
I don’t trust boxing.😅
Francis a rope a dope
Another stolen fight.
Just know the next time they get into the ring, Tyson Fury will be on then roids……
This "fight" was so FIXED, that Tyson Fury should be disgusted with himself! Wanker! Greedy Saudi's rigged this match!!!
RIGGED
The whole fight fury was fighting on his heels. After he got knocked down, he was scared for his life.
Francis  should have boxing investigated this not right. No points got deducted for the illegal elbow.
🤘
They had to Let him win he upset the fucking whole boxing community fury is trash
Disgusting robbery. Fury was beaten.
Black man was robbed 💀
Francis lost to the progressively hated fury in a heavy weight fight that went to decision. There’s no one left to match up with. The sport of boxing is dead. Regardless of skill, fury does not sell tickets. Your stuck watching fury now and there is no reason to bankroll a Francis push. Francis should retire. Unless they go for a rematch which nobody wants to see.
A bunch of bs
I respect Francis. True man
Mad respect to both fighters! Tyson Fury is the Champ! But Francis got my vote clearly as the winner on this bout! Wow
Usyk wins then fight Ngannou
In what world can you get a knockdown, get elbowed in the face, sustain no damage, and not get the “W”? Oh yeah, “professional boxing” 🙄  Guarantee, if Fury didn’t have an undefeated record, it would have been a loss.
Why this looked staged asf?
Fury weak throwing elbows put him in a cage with Francis so he can sleep
Props to Francis, but this just shows how horrible the heavyweight division has become
Ngannou won the fight… and the only reason Fury got the decision by 1 point, is simply because they couldn’t afford for their precious undefeated champion losing to an MMA guy in his first ever professional boxing match 🤷🏼‍♂️
He was in the UFC. He didn’t feel that elbow one bit 💯
LOL...why is that guy wearing an Italian restaurant table cloth?  Is that a promotional thing for pizza hut?  Where did this fight take place?  I guess I am stuck in the days of Don King promotions.
I think Tyson underestimated him
Fury always  a cheater
Boxing is a joke...the way this fuqqin cheater has been pushed through the ranks is disgusting. Everyone clearly see who won.
Fuck Texas and horns down🖕✌️👇
Run it back
The boxer who gets more knock downs should be the winner!11!1!!
Lol its only a Fury win in the boxing fairytale universe. Pathetic crybabies
Francis did all of us MMA rats so proud. For the boxing purists who don’t know, he immediately began dominating our sport out of nowhere too.. He came into MMA late in life, literally walked into a gym as a homeless man, signed with the UFC shortly after & sent many a heavyweight legends head into orbit before taking the title. Leaves the UFC at his pinnacle in the promotion for a much smaller organization, so he could have opportunities like this… it was such a massive gamble he took with his career & it’s so mind blowing, so awesome to see him shaking things up the way he is.
A flagrant elbow, got knocked down, was clearly gassed out and losing, even his celevratory jumping was half-hearted because he KNEW he should have lost.   If this **** isn't rigged, then what the hell is?   Utterly disgraceful.   Can't win, is losing, gets pissed, so he cheats with illegal moves. How fitting of "Tyson".   Mike Tyson was on drugs, and out of his mind, and is now a reformed man.   This "Tyson" Fury blob is just a disrespectful, cheating clown. Taking what isn't his. Disgusting.
That’s a fucking robbery!!!
Si llega haber una revancha Francis vencerá a Tizon F
Bro ate that elbow like damn
Rigged fight
Unless Naganou got a KO, the judges would NEVER give it to him on points.
Another Fake Sport for all Blind to see.
The fact that Tyson Fury got knocked down by a first-time boxer, former UFC fighter shows how badly the heavyweight division and boxing in general has deteriorated.
I think Francis did a lot better then whatever thought. Credit to Mike Tyson to help train Francis on the skilled boxing skills he looked like a natural boxer in the ring and with training Mike Tyson taught him
Dude the fact that francis just got out of the ufc and just boxed the heavyweight champion of the world….AMAZING. Francis is a winner regardless. Fury is the boxing King and always will be.
I would like to see a rematch
Just rigged. This matches are fixed.  You can just see it.. they not really trying to hide this crap anymore
Bro was literally robbed n hd 😂😂😂
We all know Francis won, but its whatever
At this point all sports are rigged to me
Y he kiss on him like dat at the end 1:17 honestly after I whoopped yo ahh I would want u kissing up on me 😭💯and he robbed him😭💯
Boxing is literally become a joke right infront of our very eyes i used to really love this shit. Why is the wbc handing out a belt in a non title fight why are the Saudis getting involved and not fixing the rigged judging system Why are these exhibition fights counting on their record???? Im done ✌️🖕
Love Fury
Robbed
Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The world will soon fall into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone!       John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”       We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”.       Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death.       Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT!       Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.”       Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”.        Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Repent of your sins and get saved now before it’s too late. John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”  Here are a couple links for further information.

Rigged no more ppv sold for boxing
Fury lost
Robbery
They robbed this man. I rooted for his success but I’m shocked by his performance and his results.
Thanks boxing politcs for ruining the goat underdog moment for your fake undisputed with whats his face? Little dough bellied diva cruiserweight cupcake that cant take a body shot and has refs save him from clinches? 😂
I love that so many people were crying like babies when Tyson F beat Deontay!  Same cry babies now haha
He should become a boxer
So now little people give belts away? Goo midgets
How?
Mad respect to francis mad respect he did amazing
Its not about who wins, but what draws in more money. This is why i stopped paying for fights decades ago.
That’s why boxing sucks. Always rigged.
"UNWRITTEN" Rule in boxing...."You GOTTA KNOCK the champ OUT" to win!
0:17 all them saudi’s sitting front row seeing their life flash before their eyes seeing the Usyk fight in jeopardy
Just the fact that Tyson Fury can fight as good as he does looking like some random dad from the crowd is insane to me. Dude probably went home and chilled on the couch eating donuts after this...
Fury lost
After watching the whole fight... It's like a C'Mon Man from ESPN.  Furry was fighting with punches in a clinch, lunges in with a shoulder, and that elbow.   Ngannou made him see stars... C'Mon Man!
Very Entertaining Fight!
robbery.
Francis got robbed.
That elbow was nasty and what’s nastier is that it didn’t phase him at all lmao
First time I’ve seen Fury fighting and I’m not impressed not one bit.Its like the Wish version of heavyweights of the past.Ngannou did a great job btw.
I don’t get his win, every video I see is just Tyson looked terrified and getting smacked by him or throwing illegal moves, judges are paid actors 😭
mad disrespectful to the obvious winner
Fury did not win that
Boxing is so boring..
Fury is a puts for that elbow
This is the worst highlight reel I’ve ever seen
GUYS, of course Francis ate that elbow, he eats them every time he's in that octagon.
dude fury threw that elbow on purpose. francis is such a beast to not even care or protest. just kept marching him down
Bullshit. Boxing is so effing rigged......tired of it.
That’s sad y’all don’t feel bad 😞 ?
Now lete see Fury in the cage vs Ngannou. Come on!!! Make it happen!!!
Yeah right dude lol
For you mma retards who thinks this was a close fight. Being up by 4 isnt a close fight. That 1 sided. Tyson isnt known for his power. Also he didnt even train for this fight. Yes francis did much better than we expect but he still got killed by a top fight who didnt train nor try. Also in my opinion that knocked down seemed fake
Tyson vs Ngannou ufc would be amazing 🤩
Weak ass highlight 😅
Fck boxing frfr since iron mike they dont want no mellinated man being top champ wilder was robbed gloves dont flap while punching but ok i guess I just be blind
The man who throws more shots wins In the the sport ..  But in My Book 📖 the only Book that matters Ganou won 🏆 tht
Francis was scammed
Robbery
Did they even dock a point for the elbow?????
That was a dirty Elbow by Fury 😢
What kind of BS is this lol. That was a bad decision. Francis clearly won.
Robbed
Ngannou frontin he dint even know he landed that 😂
Robbed
mad respect for tyson kissing his opponent but did it on the wrong month
Tyson was ALWAYS a dirty fighter. Glad he lost.
ROBBERY SMH
bailed by saudi family
Robbery
Gotta knock out the champ . Can’t let it go to a decision . Always been that way for better or for worse .
0:11 it looks like he’s  lifting up his body up the way you lift your pants when they falling 😂
Boxings judging is the most corrupt in all of sports.
They weren't going to let Ngannou win a decision. PERIOD. The fix was in.
Francis took the dub in my eyes tyson elbow him and got dropped
Tyson Fury ruined his legacy  With this exhibition fight.   Smdh.   Hope was it worth the money?
1;17 always licking touching ppl...bro you got beat by the Black hope gave u a way better fight than Wilder ever did smh...... he got robbes... we see how the gypsy sukkkks
Fury is a joke
Tyson fury looked wash up in this fight he needs to retire he,s over the hill his best days are behind him,retireeee
Boxing community  got nothing but excuses 4 Tyson fury the politics won him the descion 👎🏻❌💯  Francis Ngannou  made Tyson Fury look Average and the boxing community can't stand it, MMA/UFC COMMUNITY STAND UP  MY GUY Francis Nganno was totally disrespected, belittled and completely 💩 on by the boxing community said he had 0% chance of winning and that's what's wrong with y'all sports yall💩 shit on athletes too much and never give the boxer the respect they deserve and after 1 loss y'all disregard there skill and you literally kill the sport and athletes. The reason MMA UFC COMMUNITY is better cause win loose or draw we love the athletic and there journey and if you true fan you understand we don't switch up whenever they loose we support them when there down we dont kick them whenever they already are down! That's why BOXING IS 5-6 mega stars the rest the athletes nobody knows cause nobody believes and support them . Boxing is a corrupt sport and Tyson Fury knows he lost and he will eat him alive by what the majority of Media/fans are screaming Francis won that fight he is and should be heavy weight champ of the world he made Tyson fury look silly and scared a.f. so if YOUR A FRANCIS NGANNOU FAN AND BELIEVED HE WAS ROBBED AND WANNA SEE  Tyson Fury vs. Francis Ngannou 2 instead  Tyson fury run away scared to fight WE GOTTA KEEP SPEAKING OUT AND MAKE FURY FEEL THE PRESSURE AND EMBARRASSMENT OF HIS PREFORMS
Shouldn’t it be a point deduction for an intentional elbow
Arabs Robbed him😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭Arabs still hating on Africans Centuries after the Trans Sahara Slave trade🤷🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🫤🙄😐
Robbed
He gotta have better defense Tyson was scoring landing to many punches Tyson won.
The major title fights are always fixed 😅😂
the boxing association needs to rewatch
After seeing all the black people saying “robbed” I see they lied when I went back and watched. Tyson won clearly.
Ngannou robbed 🐂💩🐮💩🐂💩🐮💩
Ngannou got the heaviest punch
I cannot agree with the judges on this one
Fury didn’t this to run from Usyk and gets dropped 😂 guys down bad
TYSON FURY needs to through on the MMA gloves seeing how he threw an elbow...
They fucked him with that one Tyson fury did not win that fight..
Boxing sucks
Ain’t no fuckin way bro 🤣🤣🤣
imagine this was MMA, Francis would've gotten on top of him and pounded on him even more. Saying he'd beat Francis in the cage.. Yea right.. ahha
Boxing judges will NEVER rule in favor of the MMA fighter.
Robbed
Damn. Respect to Ngannou. That was impressive.
That was a robbery
Robbed
96-93 ??????
Knockdown no belt😮
Y'all bugging the fuck out in the comments. Tyson Fury FULLY underestimated this dude. If they fought again, I expect Fury to knock him out in 3 rounds, MAYBE 2. If he fight Wilder, Wilder will knock him out in the first round.
I am not racist, look at Africa. The French control, Africa's everything. And those are all black people.
Why fury is not fit
Fury lost this fight. Clear as day. Rip off.
So it was boring? The ad for this video was damn near longer than the "highlights"
You have to fight fury in the streets for money. Because the judges are always gonna vote for whites Is white supremacy
Was this an exhibition fight? Cause I’m trying to see what Fury did to win?
Nah let’s see a rematch..
Ngannou could have been one of the greatest Heavyweight boxers. He’s still great! I would like to see more boxing from him!
Sweet dreams Gypsy Queen, did she wake up yet from the knock out?
Rematch clause Francis won
lol what a joke
Ngannou is the new champion; we all know who won that fight!!!
Let's fucking go!!!!!
Rigged asf
Bruh they just gonna let the elbow go without deductions bruh? This shit rigged😂😂
he was scared😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
fury lost
Looked to me like the black dude dominated the fight. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Stay racially pure so you can take over the world, Russia and China!  Continue to keep blacks out of your countries!  Your plan to use black people as weapons to destroy all NATO countries is working beautifully!  Keep shipping more weaponized blacks into NATO countries and calling it immigration!  All prison gangs are divided by race, which proves that diversity is NOT our strength!!!
Nice fake ass knockdown.  Fake ass shit.
Fantastic strength that Francis has, he should not have quit the mma my respect
Francis got robbed
Baised on these highlights Ngannou shouldve won, what weak ass highlights though for 10 rounds🤣
TYSON FURY LOST ‼️‼️‼️
In my opinion, Tyson, fury was one possible point away from a drug and alcohol induced coma!!!
Fury made a  mistake by not taking this fight more seriously.
“HIGHLIGHTS” *shows 60 seconds of the knock down*
Fury was not in shape for this one
Fury lost simple as that so do knockdowns not count?
Bixing is more like Kungfu now. Win by name only
A-l-l these fighters now day's suck, Boxing died in America, after Tyson...White fighters can shine now, because the new generation black's have - NO skill and NO heart...O.M.G never thought I'd see Europeanian fighters ever dominate the game with no skill😞
That was a real fuxk knock down lol 😂
They robbed Francis top rank so rigged it’s favoritism at it’s all time high
I've been watching boxing since the Rocky Marciano days (82yrs old) and I have never seen someone knocked down 4 times and be declared the winner??????
Politics...
Francis didn't have a beat up face but Fury sure did. Iron Mike training Francis and what Francis already knew, Fury was in trouble and Francis got robbed.
Robbed him
Rigged
Same old boxing fix set up for a rematch. We all know Tyson lost this fight
Yhhhh they robbed him
Robbery..fury is dirty
96-93 judge is crooked. That basically means he think Tyson dominated the rest of the fight after being knocked down. Which just isn’t true, he ran the last 2 rounds
This was real life Rocky. Ngannou in his pro debut was able to hurt, drop, and give Tyson Fury absolute hell. Surprised me and gave one hell of a performance.
Tyson lost to me IDC what y'all say
It was at this moment....that Tyson knew he fckd up!
That was a clean win for Francis. Lennox Lewis says fury won. That’s bullshit. Bunch of cock riders. Had him on the back foot hurt multiple times. Dropped. Swollen busted up. Didn’t land anything that hurt him. WTF
That first shot though even in real speed it seemed way too slow almost like they had planned it.  I don't think they did though just saying it looks like it
Imagine where in a fight the guy who gets out boxed by a guy who isn’t a boxer & even gets knocked down by him still ends up winning. Boxing is the lamest organization ever. Completely rigged.
Let's be clear: Francis won. The moment Tyson went with the elbow, the march should have been called for Francis cuz 1) it's an illegal move in boxing and 2) the fact Tyson did it said he knew he couldn't continue without doing it
ALL respect is lost to the world of boxing!!!! The fix is in!
I’m just saying ESPN is trash at advertising. How did this whole fight happen and not one ad came across my YouTube or my real TV or my radio? This is crazy.
They don’t talk about the fury elbow
When u really look at the fury punch,   it looked like he pulled his punch, not a elbow
He looks like an old fat man
Scruum wowe out off
Iep wowe out off
Fury should’ve been disqualified for the elbow. Let’s see them in the octagon, everyone knows UFC kicks boxing.
Ngannou clearly won. So pathetic how they protect weak excuse of fighters. Every knows it.
Fury should have gotten points off for the elbow
It’s safe to say that the gap would be way bigger if the sports were reversed
That should be an L for Fury
Tyson looked like the goofball that he is when he was laying on the ground all dazed and confused 😂
The elbow was dirty af lmao
Robbery bruh Tyson is a fraud for that elbow
Dam he starting to look like wilder when he fought him
Francis not just mma this man is top boxer too like up there up there where’s wilder at or a mma fight w Tyson
Fury looked so out of shape, great job  regardless by Francis. I think coaching will be Mike Tyson’s new calling.
Fury lost. The boxing game is fixed!
Fury was in serious trouble! Fury want rematch Him!
If Francis Ngannou was an American, I would’ve said bullshit he won but he’s African so I’m glad Tyson fury won this meaningless boxing match
The African spearchucker knocks down the gypsy king
Francis Ngannou vs Jake Paul next!
Francis my man🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾 champ!!!💪🏾💪🏾🔥🔥💯💯
Mike Tyson made a beast into a monster, Ngannou got robbed of that title shot
Buffer reading the scores almost laughed when he saw the second score card. He knew it was bought and paid for.
These are such b.s. biased highlights.
Clean elbow
🤔
Um am I missing something? He knocked him down. Did fury get a knockdown in? Or was it points? How did fury win that?
Tyson lost.
How in the world was there a 96/93 score for fury? Maybe for Francis what a rigged fight. He just exposed boxing for not being athletic as they pretend.
I love fury but he lost yall need to admit it
Super proud of Francis I would love Francis v wilder. But I can tell Tyson gassed. Guarantee if he prepared like he did with wilder, he would have been MUCH more effective. But that is his weakness, he slacks sometimes
People making way too big of a deal about the elbow he whiffed the punched and his elbow barely caught his forehead stop bitching about it.
I'm glad this cheating bum fury is getting exposed he should have three losses stop putting him with greats like Ali he would get the snot beat out him facts
Nice exhibition match, hope they made the money they were looking for
Shows how good Gane is to turn Francis to wrestler
Ngannou is much a better ambassador for the sport. Furys been an annoying cunt ever since he beat wilder holding the hw division hostageZ
Fury is messy af
This is why i don't even bother to watch boxing anymore all fughts are fixed in order to make more money, now there will be a rematch, when clearly francis could of won that fight.
Francis hangs around in that strike zone with no fear and fires off bombs from there.
Boxing is a bad joke nowadays
what lol that wasn't judged, right
Francis reacting to losing and fury reaction to winning…enough said
ANOTHER FKN ROBBERY!
Tyson got beat that night them gave him the fight.
How the hell did Tyson win that fight? The game is rigged. This is one out of many reasons why I stop watching boxing matches like this.
Francis was robbed period! And this is because the score cards are definitely a little racist let’s be honest! Not one person on the planet seen it that way!
So fury was killed and he wins? 😂😂😂😂😂
We talking about how well Francis debit was .. but not how terrible Fury is as a waste boxer .. dude been boxing his entire career and still manage to cheat with elbows.. dirty tricks 😂 what an embarrassment he is..
Crazy how the ref just ignored the cheap shot with the elbow.
After this fight, I have so much more respect for Francis 🦾 He is a true champion
Who trynna bet tyson never gonna be the same again ?
Fuck fury is out of shape. They are both gonna get a even bigger payday at the rematch
Fury fan can say that he won that fight, but that's only because of the judges. Always remember that Francis's gloves never touched the canvas.😉
I’ll never understand how/why  the boxing committee just lets fury continue to do dirty tricks in every single fight.
Money Talk and B.S. well... gwh
Mike Tyson trained him and i saw nothing close to how mike Tyson fight
They cheated this black guy!
To me its a draw u kan even see how fury akts real funny when he wins mad respekt to Francis he needs 2 run it bak
BS
Something is odd. It’s as if fury already knew the judges were on his side. Boxing is corrupt. We need to accept. No way in hell boxing would allow a mma fighter win his first debut boxing match against the heavyweight champion. Imagine that.
That was in the back of the head that dont count
https://youtube.com/shorts/kBA3MjKpzEA?si=t4kMeNnB-qNwWDsM
He should have trained more... almost ruined his career.. i wanna see ngannu vs wilder
From this highlight Francis should of won this fight 🙁
Who’s the guy with the thing on his head?
homer simpson
I know Fury isn't the epitome of fitness, but he looks out of shape here compared to the Wilder fights. I think he was overlooking Francis.
Now, I see that prime Iron Mike Tyson would have knocked him out.
And that’s why I stopped watching boxing.  The judges are so crooked. Through out history, when the fight is left to the judges. The big name, and the person who can generate the most money will win.
I believe in this fight Tyson fury took this fight light and should of train harder took it more serious never underestimate nobody especially in any fight I’m sure if he gets in top shape how he did against wilder 2   I’ll be a different result but Francis did a great job took those elbows like a champ should of been a 2 point taken away but props for fury alway getting back up and fighting back n finishing all rounds. It should be a rematch.
I’m I crazy or did that elbow look intentional?
Bro this is rocky 1 in real life furry won but didn’t beat him furry hit him with his best and he just kept coming
Seems like a racist outcome. Dude catches an fury elbow doesnt say shit. Loses
What people need to understand about boxing is that the HW division has and will always be the weakest division, SKILL WISE in boxing. So many HWs in boxing have become champions after beginning their training as adults. Freaking Ali lost to a guy who had 7 fights, and lost to a guy who started boxing as an adult. The narrative around Tyson Fury, " oh he has as much skill as Welterweight, and moves like a Welterweight" NO HE DOESN'T. " He is one of the greatest HWs of all time" No he's not. He beat an old Klitchsko, and Deontay Wilder ( who began boxing as an adult). Those are Tyson Fury's notable wins. Who else has he fought besides that? HWs only need the basic fundamentals because HWs have the power to compensate for their lack of skill. Saying Ngannou had zero chance fighting in a HW boxing match is ridiculous.
Worst highlights clip ever
Man show the good stuff. You guys just showed Tyson’s small highlights. ESPN influenced by Vegas/boxing world. Pathetic
Possibly the most boring heavyweight fight I've ever seen!  Of course Fury won.  Even if he had lost every round he would have won.
Robbery
Got knocked down, threw an elbow. And still won smh 🤦‍♂️
Robbery
Love Handle Fury lost. Judges ashamed
NF made more in that fight than us whole career in the UFC! Teach your kids BOXING!
Unbelievable performance from Francis, seriously a natural born boxer and would have been a long reigning champion if he had been born in a different scenario
Wait wtf
Boxing has elbowing?
If he would have put him down a second time he would have won 🏆
Tyson Fury I think needs a good nutritionist and trainer - he seems a bit out of shape
Ngannou got robbed it was a clear win for him
RIGGED!
It was a tie.
RIGGGEDDDDDDDD
Francis won and it wasnt close and tyson did a elbow
Boxing is dead
I just love boxing. You can get knocked out on your feet, fall down, get up and throw intentional elbows and win.
This is EXACTLY WHY I don't watch or PAYndor boxing. Fights and scores fixed like the Mob running it
I thought Tyson won barely but only because Francis is unfamiliar with boxing and should have done some warmup fights. It was a lot of dancing around not like the super fights of the past boxing ain't what it used to be
Bruh 🤣🤣🤣
Ngannou shrugged off that elbow like a champ. 💪
What is this highlights there like no shots
Vegas wasnt about to pay out those odds. I hate rigged matches
Francis should have won that fight. He put on the best performance that an MMA fighter has ever had in strictly boxing.
Needa rematch that shit
Fury needs a dietary expert 😢
Stolen. Tyson Fury clearly lost this boxing match. There is literally no difference between Tyson Fury and Nikolai Valuev, both oversized bald white behemoths in boxing that only got wins and champion belts because of their size and dishonest scorecards.
Fury 😂😂😂😂what a doozweeerrrrrr
Dig Fury he could have won but didn't try, completely out of shape
Francis rules..
I can’t believe a man built like that out here winnin😂
Really could have went either way
dana can suck it
Ngannou vs Wilder
These are not highlights, wtf
Idc how the other rounds go, if you get knocked out, and don't know out the other guy, you lose.
Can we please stop calling Fury one of the greatest heavyweights of all time, he's very overrated.
ROBBERY!
I have completely changed my mind about mma vs boxing
Hey if Francis works on it he could be legit fury is just too technical with that size
Fury is a dirty boxer.
If you ever needed proof boxing is fixed here it is
He fought better than deonte wilder and in my opinion he won
Fury is so overated
Just shows how rigged the sport of boxing is like wtf fury got knocked down and hit him with an elbow and still won?? like thats a joke!
Buffer and the reff must had read the results wrong. Maybe they glitched out for a second or two while writing and reading the score cards. Clearly old boy lost the fight.
Francis loss. Good attempt, good fight, but he loss. Won one round
Francis got cheated Tyson still a dirty fighter
Pretty obvious Fury did nothing for 2 years...
Normally everyone would be sucking Fury’s Johnson for getting up lol
That elbow was crazy
Some one like this  suposted buy you house cars etc etc
Crazy how fury can get away with being built like a bag of milk
Rigged. Boxing is terrible these days.
Tyson didn't win but oh well Frances should have trained to ko
ESPN has not had none of they analyst talk about the fight why is that 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Ngannou reminds me of Jeb Bush. Where was his energy? He hit like he was driving in a school zone.
"96 to 93" 😂
His next 20 fights will be wins
This fight was staged.. Fury is way better fighter than this.. Nganau needed some money and light to shine on him and he got it
They cheated
Pure robbery...boxing ain't like it use to be it's fixed and garbage now...this was a perfect exanple....
Even the ref looked at him like “ you lost that “
Never ever..ever..supporting boxing again. This loser thug should be in jail for attempted murder on wilder. He is a cheat scum.
Rigged this why ratings are dropping plus these boxers dont have that Dog in them like the boxers had back in the 90s
Talk bout CHESTED 😮😮😮
Whyd he go easy on the camp
Francis looks good in the ring but he definitely lost.
I’m amazed to come to this common section and not see it’s spammed with “the judges and refs are wayyyycissst 😭” good job everyone proud of you and it was a great match
Andy  ruiz  will Vin  easy to fury.
How did the guy win?
Those were the highlights? Must have been a boreing fight
Tyson the goat fr
I’m a big fan of Fury but Ngannou won the fight and lost the decision.
This shit was rigged as hell. Ngannou should’ve won this fight
Does Francis bring back memories of the all time best UFC fighter Pat Smith? Pat was the funnest and most adrenaline boosting fighter of all time!
Bullshit! That’s why ppl stop watching boxing, fixed shit.
Homer/homie up  in their getting Ian gone lie.
Ngannou won all there was to win in this fight. Fury lost even if his hand was raised. But it was a really fun fight
Ok fury got knock down but out boxed ngannou all day. call is true, rematch is going to be good can't wait to see what fury does 🙏 need musule mass to beat this guy. new level big time new star ⭐ Francis 🎉
why does Fury keep saying it was a back of head shot that dropped him when it landed on side of his head and was totally legal
96-93 IS FUCKING NUTS!!!!
If this was mma fury would’ve lost, but that’s obvious
If it was mma tyson would die😂hope he atleast realizes that now
Francis ate that accidental elbow like a champ. Most boxers would have cried their way out of the ring.
I'm still astonished that Tyson Fury has retained the heavyweight title as long as he has.   He appears clumsy and without real boxing skills.  When I think of the great champions, Ali, Frazier, Foreman, Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano, Lennox Lewis, even Larry Holmes, Tyson Fury is a big clown!
Tyson looking more out of shape than ever. this was a clean and easy payday for the both of them
Idk anything at all. Maybe less than 0% ab boxing. But obviously Fury is a G. In-Gan-no (can’t spell it won’t try) is a legend. And knowing/not knowing the sport that was 100% a solid elbow by Fury. Francis’s story is awesome and that man literally lived hell to get a shot at dream and did it. To box Fury. To get a knock down. To not get embarrassed but to hold his own. The books say Fury won but Francis is my winner here. And it was awesome to see them both have respect and sportsmanship at the end. That’s what kids see and when they see YouTubers and washed up fighters/not legends throwing late hits and dirty blows on purpose or being 100% direct they’re trying to hurt or break the rules that’s not good for this sport. Or any sport. You compete. Things happens. You win or you lose but actively trying to be dirty or disrespectful leaves a bad taste if it’s not a one off or in a super super dialed competitive instance. This was awesome and made me respect the sport more after seeing people like Logan Paul and KSI treat boxing as a money machine knowing dam well if they had full training camps against a pro boxer in their weight class that was active it wouldn’t be anything short of a clinic. Jake Paul is honestly not bad to be newer. They all make their money but he’s at least fought talent. KSI and Logan Paul are a mockery. That’s like Fvcking with Tiger Woods and talking s to go head to head on 18 holes knowing you’ll lose but make 10 mill. I don’t think it should even be entertained. But it’s all about the money and spotlight for those kind of people. Not the respect or legacy or discipline. Money hungry. Great job Fury & Francis! Real fighters in a real fight!
96-93? Aint no way
Prime Mike Tyson would cut down Fury
Ngannou did a great job, but Fury will take him seriously next time and it will end with a Fury knockout.
Que robo de pelea
Ngannu is mores faster than fury and fury isn't in good shape hes body don't have any strength to receive those hits From Ngannu
Boxing is boring AF . Rather watch paint dry
Other then Wilder, who has Fury fought?  ????   Fury is a hype job.  I’ve always thought that.   Way overrated.
Another mail in the coffin.   With Showtime and HBO leaving boxing (a rich history of classic bouts).   Can ESPN and other outlets stop covering this crap?   Stop covering YouTube boxing IE Jake Paul crap.   Damn I miss the days of Al Bernstein.   Bernstein covered the fight and didn’t keep hyping up a brand fighter.   IE as does current commentary from ESPN.     Us fans of true boxing need to avoid this crap and avoid those entities that promote shit bouts.  The alphabet champs should be embarrassed.   Long live legends of the past who let their career speak for itself.  IE  Ali, Holmes, Chavez, Salvador Sanchez , Hearns, Hagler, Duran, Leonard, Arguello and many others.      By the way, YouTubers don’t know shit about boxing.   Watch a YouTuber bout, what do you see in the crowd?  A bunch of influencers holding up their cell phone.
Fury has never faced this caliber of opponent. Eff around and find out.
Fury is a cheating prick !
If these are really the sum total or even a large fraction of the highlights….yeesh, I bet the full fight was a bit mellow with a couple exciting moments of course….but maybe it’s just ESPN who is phoning in this video maybe
Fury's going to be in trouble if they really do step into a cage together.
Fury is trash. Talked the world and got dropped by the guy making his debut. How the fuck does Francis lose 96-93 when he got the only clear 10-8? Because boxing is rigged unless Francis knocked him out cold.
How did he lose??
Fury didn’t get exposed….Boxing got exposed…for the sake of boxing…they had to give the decision to Fury….boxing would lose so much value if the politics was taken out and you can just go and fight the final without building a resume’ n climbing the contender ladder….ngannou pulled a rocky balboa n beat Apollo creed so to speak…that was bad for business so boxing had no choice to cheat to protect their brand….
Left hook right hand lol
what was the point of holdin that belt?  haha there was no belt on the line to begin with.  haha if he lost, that man would still have to give it to Tyson.  haha
Francis got robbed ...fury is a bozo for that cheap shot
El boxeoo ya no sirve otro robo mas
I'm a Tyson Fury fan he's a legend, but, in my opinion Ngannou won this fight. Respect to both fighters.
That was mike tysons punch
These highlights suck lol
Why does this feel like Tyson Fury didn’t train? Are these guys real boxers or Jake Paul type fighters?
The only thing fury has is size
Zzz boring and lame as i expected
Fury is TRASH
Disgusted to watch. Seeing how Furys team its already celebrating before they declared the winner knowing deep down they've lost but also celebrating knowing that Tyson Furys hand is the one being raised. #fraud #rigged #robbery #joke #killingthe sport
When you factor in the point deduction for intentional elbowing to ngannous face, he definitely won
Transitioned into Boxing, and knocked down that Wall Tyson Fury.  Hes about to dominate.
Boxing is rigged and has always been either by the mob back in the day or by judges who feel that if Tyson fury is gonna lose he's gonna lose either by KO or in a title fight. Francis should have won that fight by a long run not only did he get the knockdown just look at furys face by the end of the fight. It's all BS
Fury was so out of shape, hopefully he takes him seriously in the rematch. On a skill level he's incredible.
These highlights it was Francis 100%. Need to the fight.
Francis won this fight 💯💯
Fury definitely paid this fight off
Tyson Fury got the brakes beat off him, respectfully.
Rigged
Fury lost....
Never realized how big Francis actually was til this fight. He also gave Fury the toughest fight of his life. I've never seen Fury so beat up in the ring.
Split decision by 1 point. Doesnt get any closer than that. Good fight
They cheated
Fury is way outta shape
Ngannou won, boxing is a joke and everyone knows that, and for a while now
This feel like rocky
Fury loss this one. What a robbery.
Ngannou is the man!!!!  the elbow, thai clinches, and double leg takedown from fury shouldve docked him points,, along with Ngannou getting the only knockdown should’ve secured it!! that little dance he did over fury after the knockdown looked like a caged fucking predator toying with a child outside the cage,, knowing that oh if there just wasn’t this rule they would destroy them, and taking joy in that,, what a fighter, what a man!
None of these men can beat fury. The best babe tried
Furry is a clown 😂
Fury pulling a right hand at :54
That elbow and they still have him the decision that’s crazy
Lol what a disgrace these dudges need to be punched like Fury for this
Never a moment that I doubted Francis. When everyone was somehow criticizing him for “fumbling the bag,” I was commending him for being principled and true to his original goal. The criticism never even made sense, I think it stemmed from Dana pushing a narrative about their falling out. People saying he fumbled the bag because he left an organization that doesn’t give him a fair bag was just goofy from day one. Well; he booked a fight with the heavyweight champion, actually had the fight without dragging on for years, made a boatload of money, and performed better than most ever expected of him, not to mention he did so while pushing age 40. Every time I think of the money that Francis had made in the beginning, but mainly the actually fair money he made by telling Dana to pack sand and not renewing his UFC contract, I feel nothing but happiness for him and his family, he deserves it. After this fight and the pay that came with it, the image that comes to my mind is Francis’ mother smiling and him getting to know that she and the rest of his family will be safe forever now. He made more money off this one fight than the entirety of what Dana’s cheap ass paid him through his entire time in that organization.   Dana was the type of cutthroat person needed to get the UFC off the ground to what it is, but now that it’s an established organization, that type of person has become a detriment and the UFC will only start to improve once he’s retired or dead. Death will probably come first, I would be shocked if Dana lived to retirement age, he’s the picture of bad health, like an even more unhealthy version of Joe Rogan.
The Excellency better slide some money for that knockdown.
I will say this was the best "money grab" fight by far. I'd watch a rematch!
How he win??
What the actual fuck
Los arabes  no aguites orita te asemos millonario$$$$$
Trash
Ring girl?
KSI elbow wtf, boxing so corrupt, y i prefer kickboxing
No point deduction from the elbow?
So deonty knocks him down 2 loses 🤔
What a shit show
Rigged
Fury looked so bad.
how did NGANOU lose HE WON THIS IS RIGGED WAKE UP
How did fury win when he got knocked down and elbow this man did they not take a point off for that and he only won by a point boxing so rigged up I don't see how ppl even wanna be a boxer
Racism is still very much so alive and well in todays age
Francis looked like a veteran pro boxer in there. He should definitely switch over to become a boxer
i wonder how much the random arab guy paid to give that belt lolol
I’m not taking away from Francis fight he prepared well and did amazing. However I think Fury greatly underestimated Francis and in his camp and didn’t really train. Hats off to both fighters and their incredible journeys to the top 🙏🏾
When fury got dropped I bet he was thinking, this fucking dossa!
Dat elbow a real gypsy king move
Francis clearly won . He got robbed so bad it’s ridiculous
he was never going to win. boxing wouldnt allow it. cant make money off a defeated fury
How did he lose that?
How did he lose that?
Lol Ngannou started walking forward ready to jump on and finish him. Fury lucky these are big gloves!
Love Tyson but that was robbery.
My boy got robbed
So no one gone comment on how that man just got cheated
Fighting this bum let Ruiz fight stop duckin wreck
On the knockdown…. Tyson looked up like “oh shit he throwing them bitches 😮‍💨”. Dat boy made the 😮‍💨 face and all
It's sad to see a boxer flat-out woop someone in knock them down in Lose the fight he was robbed broad daylight in front of the police
Bro fury lost for sure
Yeah yeah Gypsy King but F.N. was good I try not to throw my downhook because of the elbow but great fight.
Wtf! He knocked him out! How could've fury won?! 👎 sorry but Francis should've won...hands down.
Francis one and we all know how rigged this shit is? how many fights that are left to shady judges can you count that were completely wrong and one sided? I can count alot!
Word is there has been a APB out out the judges  today for Robbery!!
Francis beat the fight I don't care what nobody say Francis win the fight
This is why boxers don’t want to step on the octagon. Imagine knocking someone down and following through with it . Conor call boxing “ half a fight”
Its more of a testament to nothing these dudes can hit him with anything that compares to little gloves and shins in MMA.
I don't know how Tyson Fury win the fight with his elbow he did not win the fight
0:28 a look of pure fear
Tyson Fury did not win the fight
Tyson Fury cheated he's useless elbow that's not boxing you can't use your elbow
francis is different. his tendons are solid steel and his mind is built to fight
I love how fury said he got dropped cause he got hit in the back of the head what a fat bag of milk fury is …. And how fury threw an intentional elbow that landed flush on Francis and nothing was said about it .. if it was the other way around ppl would be calling Francis a cheating bastard
Fury straight up intentionally threw an elbow!!!
the elbow was INSANE!!!!
Wow. Now this is wooooow. Francis. Woooooooow blew my fling mind
Francis won rounds 3, 7, and 8. I can't find another round that he won. Let's pretend he won rounds 1 or 2. Then it would be a draw. But he lost rounds 1 and 2. Even if you give both a tie, which I thought it was. Francis still loses by 1/2 pt. The judges were right on. ✅️
Francis is like a bigger mike tyson😂
Highway Robbery
Omg this is the BEST! Francis the boxing heavy weight GOAT loool
Yall all he got robbed. For one hes black but the main reason you cant have newbie from another sport come in and beat an established champion boxer. Boxing would fall if that happened. Mike tyson would destroy fury.
As much as I like Tyson Fury. He did not win that fight.
ngannou was robbed
Even Furry didn't think he won😂😂😂😂
Francis Ngannou is coming off a torn MCL/ACL and hasn't fought in almost 2 years. Yet, he still beat Fury in his first boxing match🤣🤣🤣
Seen the Saudis not react when he dropped lol there ass holes tightened up for a second 😂
If Francis was born in America I feel like head would a NFL defensive lineman.
I’m black. So excuse my language. But Tyson fury is a big Nigga… seeing him fall in slow mo 😂😂😂
Maybe Fury ain’t used to those punch angles
If Ngannou can get a little more fast twitch action going he will be a huge?problem.
Come on that was a dive. He barely hit him
Bro that dirty jipsy elbow 😂
The ref stopped counting to talk to Francis foh
Francis won
Damn even ESPN sold on the highlights too make it look like it was closer for fury, Ngannou got robbed
Rigged that couldn't have a UFC fighter beat fury it wouldn't have been good for the sport
THIS is why Fury ducked Usyk and why he's going to get schooled by the Ukrainian
This reminds of i won but i didnt beat him
What a fight from great boxers
Happy for Ngannou! What a wild life he lived before living this one.... Absolutely amazing
That Boy Fury Got A Dose Of Francis Power 😂... Not 2 Be Played with buddy 😂😂😂 He Definitely Lost This Fight Look At His Face 😂 I Mean For Francis 2 Come Over 2 Boxing From MMA is Elite.... He Did Better Than Wilder For Sure and if they run it back he'll beat Fury No Doubt...Too Much Heat For Fury😂
They should of taken a point from Fury by using that elbow, and Francis got robbed
Dana white punching air
What a disgrace Fury throwing elbows to win against a non boxer.
Absolutely robbed
Give Tyson some credit giving this guy the chance,plus name some other heavyweight that would get into the ring with Frances? he's use to getting punish in kick boxing and he can take hits I say even give Tyson credit for going 10 rounds and winning!
good decision
Trash. Never mind the intentional elbow.🙄🙄😒😒
I know it was his debut but wouldn’t Francis have been technically “ still undefeated “ as well prior to the announcement ?
Should have knocked him out knowing how corrupt boxing judges are
R O B B E D
Ahh hell nahhh. Francis whooped that man
These rigged decisions make me almost not want to watch the sport anymore!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHQSfO_T2DY
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHQSfO_T2DY
All things considered, Ngannou looked solid and I'm looking forward to seeing him continue his newfound path in boxing!
Ate that elbow like nothing
I would not want to be hit by Francis. That dude can generate so much power it’s unbelievable.
Robbery
If Francis keeps training he’ll be world champion in less than a year
Bullshit decision rematch
217 mins long shout to the jesuits
That’s a Bull Sh!t decision…. FURY clearly lost…. Wow!
Fury lost that was robbery
Sorry Fury was knocked TFD. He Lost in my Book
Back of the head
Ngannou didn't complain about that elbow because he's used to it. Continued that fight like the warrior he is.
Those judges should never be allowed to this job ever again yo dropped his fat flabby ass 🤣 got a knockdown and hit with an illegal elbow?!? N still scored by each judge by one point that elbow alone should have made em loss smdh MMA OVER BOXING ANY DAY OF THE WEEK after seeing this tho Tyson fury wouldn't stand a chance in a MMA bout boxing is a disgrace period
Everybody SWORE furry was gone do sum🤣🤣he only won by decision bc he’s Caucasian
Lol were the judges watching the same fight we were? Without factoring in the knock down, it was competitive and close. With the knock down? There's no way Fury edged out the victory here. What a joke of an organization 😂😂😂
If he wants it, he just made it in the Heavyweight division and mega million dollar paydays.
Rigged af boxing is not fair at all
Where did Fury’s punching power go? Lol
Francis got robbed & jobbed. Boxn isa joke now adays....✊🏽😐❤️👉🏽🥊🦬💩
After the elbow watch Tyson begin his decent, hes gonna fall now.
We gone act like we didn't see that big illegal elbow he landed and still lost.  Garbage juice!
If you were picking a boxing team out of a hundred men and didn't know any of them, Tyson would be in the left overs no one picked. He does not look like a fighter, maybe a bar fly bouncer. But he isn't what he appears. He's smart,fast and has my upmost respect!
Boxing is so boring it needs to just end Zzzzz
Elbows, bad scorecards from the judges, slow fuckin count😂🤦🏾‍♂️ Ridiculous rigging..boxing isn’t even hiding it anymore
I have a question if the Bible is just a myth why do all of your problems come from doing the opposite of what scripture says?
Do a rematch  the other man win
He will lose in a rematch
Got robbed
Tyson at the end looks so nervous like he knew he lost & was suprised to win
Francis Ngannou also has a granite chin along with above average boxing skills 🔥🔥🔥🥊🇨🇲
Francis got robbed
Professional Boxing is not legit.  They think we are completely stupid.  Hand on Heart, I will never watch pro boxing ever again.
HOW IN THE HELL DID FRANCIS LOSE?!?!? YOU CAN EVEN HEAR HOW SILENT THE CROWD IS AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT WTF LOOK AT THEM BOTH A DAY AFTER TYSON GOT FUCKED UP!!!!!
RIGGEE BEYOND BELIEF
How can that chubby guy be a boxer?
A knock down and getting elbowed but still loses through decision.
I thought Fury had retired?
Man fury fans are the biggest D riders in the world. Shit is hilarious
From the humblest start to becoming the deadliest man on the planet. Ngannou should be champion of MMA and Boxing.
That man got robbed
Put it this way in Tyson fury’s way since they want to bring up king shiz medieval shiz. At the moment  Francis knocked him down that would of been done in the real world. Tyson didn’t even know where he was. So In reality Francis is the most dangerous and heavyweight champion of the world. Period.
Francis lost the decision but won the fight ..
95/94 just showed fixed fight b/c how the first 95/94 ngannou but not the last one fury🤔 #rigged
Wtf did I just watch
rigged he went down and still won come on
They gotta run it back first time in awhile a boxing event has been worth the momey
ain’t no way Francis lost from the highlights I just seen. Boxing Judges love to suck off the Furys
It would be financial negligence not to do a rematch for 12 rounds. Both guys would make so so so much more money
Esta pelea la robaron!!!! Y se la dieron a Tyson Fury😒😠
Fury won that match even tho he got knocked down he still finished the fight. How many times you seen champions lose by decision rarely. Hats off to Francis great fighter.
I think Fury wanted to make it an entertaining close fight for the promotional value but didn’t expect Ngannou to be that good. He always mentioned he didn’t want to be a pro boxer until he’s older into his late 30s getting his brain bashed in over and over so maybe this is his ticket to transitioning to non-professional boxing. Had it been a dominant win by Fury, it would definitely not have created this much interest, excitement and promotion value for a potential rematch.
Highlights were short af wtf
White is right.
My man's just Ate a fucking elbow and licked his lips like it was some chicken 🐔 0:53
Nah. That elbow was beyond foul
Take a point for the elbow Tyson lost what a way to protect the great white hope. Next time knock him out
I think Fury just thought that all he had to do was show up to win.  Found out different.  People are saying he should have lost the fight.  He clearly wasn't in shape for it.  There has to be a rematch after this.
Maybe the showboating was the deciding factor against him? I know some people hate that crap. No need for it. Knock the guy down, be humble and walk to your corner. No need for all that show boating crap. Makes you look like an idiot when you lose.
Dana White is dumb as hell for letting Ngannou walk.
Can you imagine had Francis really loaded up on that punch that knocked Fury down. I don't even think he would have survived if you would have killed that man lol😮
Wow Boxing is faker than Wrestling.
Another rigged boxing match
AND THE NEW CHARLIE ZELENOFF OF BOXING FURY ZELENOFF AKA TYSON ZELENOFF AKA TYSON "FURY" ZELENOFF NOW THE NEW MOST LAUGHABLE NAME IN BOXING... TOOK TWO TITLES FROM TWO DIFFERENT MEN AT THE SAME TIME.. THE NEW MOST LAUGHABLE  JOKE IN BOXING TYSON FURY ZELENOFF😅😅😅😅😅😅
Wilder better stay away from this animal!
Boxing is rigged! That’s all I have to say!
I wonder if Jake Paul is going to call out Francis out? I doubt it. He only calls out guys that are past their prime on are smaller then him.
I think Francis should ask for a second fight he would he would knock out I think
That fight was fix word he lose .. y'all stop fixing fight for MONEY TAKING PEOPLE PRIDE AWAY WORD Y'ALL SEEN THE FIGHT LOST THAT .. HE KNEW LOOK HOW U LOOKED AT HIM AFTER GAVE IT TYSON FIX FIGHT
Bs!
In order for Fury to win after being knocked down he would have had to have a couple rounds of clear advantage. Fury lost this fight.
Fuck that Tyson lost fair and square they rob that man out that fight boxing 🥊 is bullshit
Wow! You gotta love this guy Ngannou’s story!  What an underdog, what a class act, what a humble soul!
The irony when a boxer elbows a MMA fighter and thinks it will surprise them. MMA guys just like "first time?".
He hit me with a elbow im going to use my mma art
From what I have seen in this short video. It looks like Tyson fury lost. Tyson should have been disqualified for that elbow. But it's all about money.
Francis Ngannou Has to be the best boxer that has came out of MMA so far!!!
One knockdown won win him a split decision he should be more aggressive..
Francis is an absolute unit. I can appreciate fury’s sportsmanship in this.
Fury is over rated. The way boxing allows fighters to pick there opponents he will never be a GOAT
Francis got robbed. They just couldn’t give him the decision because it would have destroyed the boxing industry
Split decisions may as well be a draw in my book.
Straight up robbed him but in boxing if you can't knock out the champ chance is you're gonna get robbed
Y'all better put some fn RESPECK on Tyson Furys name! They keep throwing these roided up beasts at him and he is winning looking like Shrek out here! Think about how hard Francis was hitting him and he went the distance. Can you!? Fuck no.
Wilder should be ashamed of himself and he needs to ask Mike Tyson to train him instead of Malik Scott
He knock him out twice. He should've won that fight smh. Rigged forsure
What kind of highlights are these? Show more  smh
سیکس
The cartels need to step in and  take away the Saudi influence in boxing. Period.
Boxing will very soon become a wrestling.mivi  Fake decisions defines boxing.  Majority doesn't reflect the decision of this fight.  They will not like to rematch them soon rather they will put it on to Anthony Joshua.  They want him to @ the top.  Fury I don't hate you but your era has gonna.
Fury wouldn’t last a rematch.
This fight just proves that MMA is a harder sport than boxing. If you put Tyson fury in an MMA fight with ngannou everyone knows Fury would get absolutely devastated. But Ngannou almost won a boxing match against Fury.
Back of the head behind the ear
Everybody saying that Ngannou would demolish Fury in a street fight. Well, no shit! How long do you think Mayweather would last against Khabib? The point is boxing is a specific type of craft, not a complete fighting system.
F*** TYSON FURY Make that a chant
I have said this for a while now the fact that Tyson fury is the king of heavyweight division shows how watered down the division is. Now do I think he took this seriously no I don't fight again I believe he would smoke him but I will say it the best heavyweight right now is jared Anderson the only thing others may be able to get him on is experience. Wilder made it to the top on just power no skill
Francis is gonna be knockout the whole division
Francis Ngannou should have won. Tyson Fury has resilience ill give him that. But ultimately it should have been Francis who should have won. Thats my opinion.
Yeaaah  I don't agree
Wata ROB!!
Here comes all the loser Wilder fans crying about racism again🤣🤣🤣
Whatever side the sheek is on the guy with white......is the winner Arab money 😂😂😂😂😂
Judges got it wrong! Ngannou won that fight!
Fury said it was a hook in the back of the head stop lying he hit you right behind your ear looked right on the button that was a perfect knockdown by francis
These judges need to be held accountable, Ngannou won plain and simple.
And still!!!!
throwing elbows on purpose is legal?
Not fair.😢
Now you know this shit is rigged
Would either of these guys have lasted more than 2 rounds with Larry Holmes?
All of the top comments are singing Ngannou's praises but can't seem to admit he should have won. The lies people tell themselves just to avoid facing the truth is astonishing.
Nope bad call.. obviously one sided.. 😮
This is rigged. They dont want to see a brotha get the title. He clearly won.
Robbery
Please people stop all the BS, Tyson won on points every sport thats how u win,baseball,football,basketball etc etc i watch the whole fight with a note book Tyson won most rounds and connected more thats how u win, if anything he should have taken all score cards,after the knock down in the 3rd Tyson took the next 4 rounds, and he said his toughest fight in 10 yrs,Francs should continue as a heavyweight with MT TRAINING HIM!!
Francis Ngannou's childhood was rougher then that fight
If y’all think this is boxing you’re nuts!!! This fury guy? One of the sloppiest styles I’ve seen since I’ve been interested in boxing.. fury is just big and can move!!! Everything else is sloppy!!!
I love my country 🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Francis very humble man!
Imagine if Tyson Fury was in top physical condition the man is a beast now but he would probably be a champion contender for many years to come. He fights off of pure natural strength now if he slimed down and built up a bit he would probably have mor punching speed with even more power the man would be even stronger than he currently is and no one would want to get in the ring with him. I like the guy it’s been a long time since we had a champion like him. He looks to be approachable for like young kids to say hi and all that. I hope he stays healthy and strong so he can continue to give us all the entertainment he has already given us .
How’d Francis catch Fury off guard, I could see if Fury was sitting on the toilet and Francis just barged in and hit him, but they were both in the ring face to face fighting? How was Fury catch off guard?
Francis was robbed Boxing is BS
This was refreshing after all of the influencer boxing B.S.
Bruh it’s certain Jon jones don’t want none of Francis that man had Tyson confused for two rounds off of one punch and he was skilled
Worst highlights ever.  According to these highlights the fight had one knock down and an elbow.  I swear there seemed to be much than that when it was watched live.
That was BS
Ngannou was robbed of course they have to lie to themselves but the world knows lol just like everything else they steal lie cheat what’s new?
Robbed. Completely robbed. That would have put a nail into the coffin of boxing and they weren't having it. This has left a bad taste in my mouth and I know more than a few people feel the same way so it might be putting a nail in there anyhow.
In Trump voice: "It was rigged"
What!,!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
A completely FRAUD .. WTF😠😡
Maybe the biggest robbery I've ever seen, boxing looking like wwe right now
A 😚 wtf .
Was everyone else watching the full Highlights of this SAME fight?! How Dafuq did Nagnou not win this?!  Nagnou was robbed!
That’s BS tha judge gave 96-93 for Fury!!!😡😡😡
That elbow didn't bother him at all
If it's not apparent yet that boxing is rigged then idk what the hell yall are watching. Francis should've won!!!
Theft!
I bet fury doesn't want a rematch 😂
Dewey cooper was the real hero here !! Trained this man’s striking nice and sharp
The UFC is steaming rn😂
I want to meet both of these guys
Fury taking a page out of KSIs book with that elbow 😂
that fight was not judge right at all
How do you score a knock down don't take any damage an still loose even after taking a elbow is a slap in the face from boxing
Dude on steroids vs dude not on steroids
We can only hope this brings more eyes to pfl
One big giant dx crotch chop to Dana white
Tyson fury definitely lost. But ok. I'm convinced the judges are tards.
this fight was so rigged to defend tysons reputation
Bum juice
That man was robbed smh
Once Ngannou hit him with the thug shaker it was all over
Love how Francis seemed completely unphased by that elbow, what a beast. This was only his debut and he still performed THAT well. Baddest man on the planet.🤫
Frances won that from what I seen..
I'm a purist but thought that decision was about to be for Ngannou.
Bro he did great
Of course they gave the win to Tyson he obviously lost
This shit was fixed.  Ngannou won this fight.  Fury said the script didnt play out as planned at the end.  Hmmm
Francis Won That Fight
Francis won that fight!
Mike Tyson did a fantastic job training Francis.
I absolutely LOVE Tyson Fury, never will disrespect the GOAT that he is, but damn did Francis put some work on this man this past weekend 😭🔥🔥🔥
Ngannou just happy to get paid that $10mil 😂😂 good for him though he deserves it
Ngannou represented himself and MMA like a boss, I had it 7-3 fury but to give fury a black eye and cut when wilder couldn’t do any damage to Tyson’s face in 3 fights and dropping him?!!! What a performance
Iron Mike was proud I'm sure
He won more money this fight then all of the UFC together.
Everyone knows that unless Fury gets knocked out the judges gonna always say he won
Ngannou will only get better. Big payday. What he made in 1 fight boxing is as much as his entire mma career
96-93 judge was the one who got paid. He made sure to have fury up 3 points
Bad decision
Robbery
Francis got robbed.

wtf are they watching fury had no chance or way to win . the shit a joke .#rigged #furyfeltdefeat
B.s
Mike tyson is the real mvp. He really gave Francis ngannou a zenkai boost and accended him to a new level. He was NOT that good before he was coached by mike tyson.
Ngannou shoulda won wtf
Dana White said it best "Don't let it go to the judges"!
Weakest highlights since mike tyson vs roy jones
I Think also Tyson fury didn’t train serious for this fight . I mean man walk out to pretty woman lol
UFC and Dana really dropped the ball on this one. Fighters like Francis come by once a century.
Robbed!!!!!
Who the fuck is fury????
Fury lost. Period.
Robbery.       USKY IS GUNNA DESTROY THAT MAN
They gotta run it back
how does a guy win when he got knocked down and didn't knock down the other fighter?  BS.
Now think if it was bare knuckle boxing no gloves Tyson lost and would get absolutely destroyed in a street fight against Francis  MMA Francis = baddest man alive
with the money involved in 🇸🇦 and all revenue from casual boxing fans I wouldn’t be surprised if the fight was staged and fury was paid to go 12 rounds. Knowing how corrupt boxing is. Seriously Francis has better punch than wilder and is smarter than Dillian whyte?????logic it’s out of the equation on this….
Absolute BS by the 93-96 judge that clearly got paid
IS THAT A REMATCH I HEAR FROM WAKANDA  BLACK PANTHER - AS U CAN SEE I AM NOT DEAD
Boogus
Definitely rigged
Tyson's only highlight has a dirty elbow in it, mean while francis has a whole knockdown RIGGED FOR BETTING CLEAR!
“IS THIS YOUR KING?!?!?”
He won that fight i don't care. And in the octagon it's would have been quick. Even nicked Tyson in his own game. Would have been over right there is you could follow through after that
😂 I’m dead
Robbed my boy complete b.s
bull shit fury even hit him with a nasty elbow
I’m a Ngannou fan, but I scored it 95-94 Fury. But let’s be honest it’s a win win for Ngannou to take Fury to a decision
Ngannou won that was rob bs
Mf robbery
Fixed
That's fucked up that some weird shit right there
The Fury’s and their illegal punches works like a charm 😂
That elbow was serious but he use to that shit lol I wanna see the whole fight
I see a new career for Francis Ngannou! What a performance to go toe to toe with the WBC champ!!
They robbed Francis
No lost points for the elbow
Fury even knows it was a robbery, so fake. What is the world coming too. Judges are useless
What a robbery
This is what I like good sports manship from these guys not like Logan Paul and Dani's people who actually care to box not just a pay day
Fake knock down rigged
Rematch
Ngannou is a tough mf
ngannou was robbed
Francis got robbed....
Fury was shocked by Francis power. He didn’t even fully connect and knocked him down. Tyson throwing elbows like it’s a ufc fight
Straight up robbed him. Even Fury fans (me) knows he lost.
Francis won 🥇 😢
Ngannou scored a knockdown & fury hit him with an ilegal elbow how did fury win❓🤔🤔🤔
They basically gave that fight to Fury.They definitely got to keep the great white hope in a prominent position to not lose.They’re basically saying you’re going to have to knock his cheating ass out because if it goes the distance they’re going to make it difficult for any black opponent to win by decision.
And this is why most do not care about boxing.
God this division is such trash now
Great fight, Ngannou did awesome and Fury seemed really light on his feet. Well done fellas.
Robbery
If Nagannou started a boxing career he could easily become the champ
Look at Tyson Fury corner at the end. Deep down they know Tyson fury lost that fight😏
I was a Fury fan but he really embarrassed the entire sport of boxing with that performance.
Welp
how that ref ain't see that elbow?
Im 100% sure a few more rounds and fransis would of had it
Furys so fat😭
Wtf is this crap
Stop it everyone knows Francis won this fight Fury gave top to judges
Ngannou definitely won that fight.
All I heard leading up to this fight was what can Nganou do to make it somewhat entertaining. WELL,, ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED!!!
Bull shit fury lost fight
They need to do something about the unfair decision in boxing what a steel such a big big  shame
Mike’s training did history here  o matter what the result is ! UFC player showed  incredible control !
Hell nah fury should have been dqed for that elbow
He got robbed
Dirty white tyson threw the elbow
Ngannou is such a beast. Takes an elbow and just keeps moving forward. I don’t think anything is taking him down. I’m taking him with a W if they ever rematch.
Remember back in the day when people could lose and everyone didn't cry about it? This "My guy didn't win so the game is rigged" mentality is killing everything from politics to sports.
I was honestly expecting more from Ngannou. Dude seemed like he'd deliver a KO and end the fight in 30 seconds. Goes to show even more what a monster Tyson Fury is.
Francis got cheated
FREE PALESTINE !!
Frances win
You know you're losing when you purposely throw an elbow
African brothas not water down like American brothas!! They have ORGANIC POWER you haven't seen nothing yet
I think the judge that scored it 96-93 Fury was watching a Fury highlight reel of other fights and not this one. In what world did Fury win that many rounds?
The fact that Fury took to Francis like that is hilarious. You got all these insanely sculpted athletes that get mollywopped, then you got Fury lol
Tyson LOST the fight. No deduction for the elbow - lost his legs in the last round. Got clobbered and because he has another fight to defend the belt, they gave it to him. The rematch will be interesting.
JOHNNY BONES JONES ‼️
I didnt see any Tyson highlights and he won?
Francis got robbed
Nganou!!!
Fury lost that fight
*LIVE YOU DREAMS KING FRANCIS!. **#BLESSINGS*
GYPSY KING WINS AGAIN
No African is losing a fair fist fight to a European 😂
No way he won that
Booooooooo
He showed up and put on a great show and great fight FRANCIS
Francis got robbed there is no question about it. Francis is 5 inches shorter than Tyson Fury and you can clearly see he's nothing but muscle and only weighed 5 pounds less at the weigh in. He showed up much more well conditioned and much stronger than anyone expected.
Where are the haters now? He made more in 1 fight than in his whole UFC career!!
Francis doesn’t have the best skills but he’s pretty much a tank with great power. But the most impressive thing that sticks out to me most watching this fight was that nothing really effected him whether the fight was going his way or not and that’s very dangerous. He’s just a bad matchup for any man in the world.
Fury ass always gettin knocked over and still end up winning who riggging these fights
Fury is a "Goon".Slow fat and a disgrace.Any competent fighter from the Ali era would make a mess of him as would Tyson.Fury would not be able to take just one bodyblow from Joe Frazier or George Forman.By the way-this decision was a disgrace.
He loss STOP THIS ROCKY SHIT
I thought if you get knocked down you lose unless you knock your opponent out but i guess you can win on points
Boxing is just like wwe
he was robbed the only way you beat a big profile fighter is to knock him out francis wasnt hurt by anything, rematch!!
NOTHING NEW  OTHER ROB
What a rip off and they know it.a way to make more money in a rematch
He got Cheated!!!
A rematch would be better though. Francis now believes in himself as a boxer and Fury would take him more seriously.
ROBBED
It’s very obvious who would come out on top if these two men met in a parking lot.
Francis is the lineal UFC HW champion and the unofficial HW boxing champion. He is the baddest man on the planet.
Bullshit decision
I say Francis looked like a slow and unsure version of Mike
Like i said the only way francis can win is by knockout.
Ngannou got robbed.
This could be the final nail for boxing
To Beat the champ you have to BEAT the champ. Split decision is never enough.
Francis won that fight
Boxing is a joke! Francis won that
Se la debieron dar al tipo , fury no lucio tan bien
Fury's love handles look like a booty above his booty 😂😂😂😂 He lost
Fake af
Fury got beat.. worst beating he's took in a bit.. but if Francis won it would be to much of an upset to boxing.. but we all seen fury get beaten like he stole something 😂😅😂
I’m so done with boxing. Shit is just a joke 😂😂😂😂
FIRST KSI NOW FRANCIS 🫤 🤔 SOMETHING AINT RIGHT
Robbed. Boxing and Football has lost their integrity…
I feel like if they would've had on those ufc gloves this would've been a bloodbath, lol
Had to watch this in slow motion. Fury did win by 3 punches. Furys forearm hit Francis not his elbow. Also  Francis caught Fury in the 3rd round. That punch was a solid punch. But it was so close to the back of the head that it could be Illegal.  But this fight showed that Francis could be a Champion. I would love to see Usyk and Francis go at it.
Ngannu won this fight but boxing's pride wouldn't let him claim his victory that elbow should've cost Tyson a point and it should be a draw at the very least 💯
Francis won this fight!!!! Hands down no questions asked!!!!!! Brilliant and the Gypsy guy is a very dirty fighter.
no mames pinche robo
The world witnessed a man getting cheated out of his win after a nock down! Why?
ROBBERY AT IT'S BEST FRANCIS WON THAT FIGHT
It different wen they don't approve of ur cheating gloves u see fury has no real power but because he white hope once again another black fighters get rob the racism bias shit gotta stop
Wait what this is a real fight ???
Fury is not undefeated
He got up like a lion so why Francis is dancing Tyson landed most punches throughout the whole fight
Francis was robbed
Tyson fury es tremendo es como si quiso aguantar el golpe y lo aguanto y siguió peleando. Ala moe!
Francis won that fight there's no way he lost...
Don't be on Francis now y'all was on Tyson fury he's gonna destroy him man yall know tht boy Tyson lost but they can't let it go down like tht😂😂😂😂😂 jus like deante
Robbery
What a fking robbery.
Points should have been taken off for that elbow. Fury lost that fight.
Furys a Dirty fighter
Heavyweight boxing is completely dead. Champ has to fight dirty and can't hardly compete against a guy that's just trying to keep in fighting shape for cage matches. Fury is an embarrassment for a Heavyweight champ.
Breaking News John Fury has sworn to defend his son's honor after Francis turned Tyson into his gypsy bride last night.
Such a bias highlight show wow. UP THE FURY
Right off his big fat egg head
He got robbed for sure ngannou definitely shouldve won this period whether u favor one over the other
It's clear they will give it to the white guy to keep that title and get his name in the history books 😉
Right. We've seen this before. Fury has a terrible performance right before he faces the top guy, then destroys the top guy. I'm betting it happens yet again until it changes.
Nasty guy
His first boxing match gets hit with a cheap elbow knocks the guy down and still loses 👎🏿👎🏿
Very easy simple concept basic logic if life is not free why the hell would death be any cheaper it's not. So the question one may wonder is the spiritual cost to one's own soul and spirit for having lived and died  only using the smallest percentage of A fraction of the true potential they were first born with equally as reckless neglectful at the same time to the lowest standards of quality for so many years now global pollution has diminished the quality of life to the point where today's people are living, dying and yielding the worst spiritual kickback that has ever been manifested since the beginning of life only getting worse.  The polar opposite extreme to that is today's people should be living and dying to the highest standards of quality which would make each and every moment physically, mentally, financially and spiritually beneficial rewarding constantly consistently S.R.F.
Robbed … what about that elbow
Much, MUCH respect for N'gannou.
Down goes Fury!!
Rigged fight
Ngannou ate that elbow like It was nothing
All the comments say he did great? This was his very first boxing match and looked like he about to become Tyson. After seeing that elbow and how ngannou did blink was miraculous..i watched the entire fight and Francis won.
They need to investigate this
One point away is devastating 😢😢
Fury starting to fight dirty " elbow " and the score card had the results of the fight but the ring announcer said something else  . It's all about who can sell tickets
Ngannou got a future here
little muslims and jews can not comepete in boxing?  how come? no pork should be very good health for these little people.
Really francis 😢 u ran from jones to this RIP competition
He knocks Fury down, clearly had him hurt for a bit, but then shows absolutely no desire whatsoever to try to capitalize on it for the last 15-20 seconds of the round. I mean damn I wouldn't even say that's bad strategy, just badassery, but it did cost him.
All about money ✌🏻
i mean, let's be honest.  even if fury won the match, the fact that ngannou almost beat him is HUGE.  fury isn't some chump - he's a legit badass.  I don't have a dog in this fight - i'm just super proud that ngannou almost beat him
Boxing used to be my favorite sport. But I lost track of yet another big fight and as a result don't care that I missed all the hype and all the build up. The highlights don't move me either. I don't care anymore.
Wow! Fury back was twerking. 0:37   shake it for zaddy.💲💲💲💰💰💰💸💸💸💸
Now imagine if you could finish your opponent on the ground, Francis would be world champion boxer..
Ngannou I thin won.
Boooooooooo
Honestly if you guys have ever seen his mma fights y’all know Francis can knockout any man on the planet  What suprised me is his boxing skills he learned!!  Double jabbing in there He popped the gypsy king and left him looking like he didn’t know what hit him!!! Just like in his mma fights!!! Guys don’t know until they feel his pop! All look shocked
Fury won but he didn’t beat  Ngannou
So no ones gonna talk about how this was a robbery? Lmao
split decision my @$$ Francis had tyson on the retreat almost the whole fight
Nah this proves these are all scripted af .-. They RUINING boxing
Cus d'amoto would be very proud of mike👌🏿
Great fight.....right call
Ahhh Youtube comment sections… just take in the stupidity
Fury barely landed a single punch in this whole video lol
Tyson fury just got whooped this whole highlight package and then won in the end something is definitely off lol
Imho....Francis did so good that if I were Fury I don't think I'd risk fighting him again 🤷‍♂️
these dudes have so much, they make fights we want to watch possible.  They can make some coin off francis, but i dont think they need it.
FAKE
Man Francis looks more of a real boxer, than Denote Wilder, no disrespect to Wilder, but he just looks for the knockout, instead of focusing on the task at hand, Francis really pushed Fury for his debut, which was impressive!
Sheiks are like pharaohs when Americans see them.. it’s more wilder than Deontay
Francis won fr
Man fury just knew he lost lol tell by the look on his face
At 0:56 fury purposely thru that elbow you can just see by the way it was that he throw it on purpose what a bum he is
Once Francis refreshes his boxing skills he’s gonna be unstoppable.
That elbow was dirty!
Francis clearly won this. Rigged BS.  Tyson wouldn't Dare step into the octagon with Francis
Sorry Fury lost that fight!
Tyson fury sucks as a boxer he lost that one in my eyes
Fury seemed determined to lose yet he won.🐟🐡
Fury took advantage of Ngannou being dazed from his illegal elbow i wonder if the judge took that into consideration 🤔
This is rigged af giving him a free win ? Throwing an elbow wtf
Bruh how the hell did fury win
REMATCH
Fury didn't go full throttle! He took it easy on Him.
I can’t believe these comments watch the whole fight if you think fury won you should never judge a boxing match in your life also after that knockdown fury ran scared he felt the power with big ass gloves Francis is the baddest man on the planet in ufc street right after knockdown he was dead boxing even though I love it is not comparable to how real fight would go crazy street fight fury dies third round
Damn those hours with Mike Tyson showed some damn amazing results.
I love Tyson fury but that elbow looked intentional
Can't wait to see more from Francis. Makes boxing in the heavy weights exciting to watch again.
Bull shit.
That was a bullshit split decision win i  score boxing fights now for 7 years Francis definitely won not by that much but had him up a point but anyways fury threw a illegal elbow which should have definitely taken away a point so Francis won with and without illegal shot
Soo...when you get knocked down and smashed...you win!?
They need to check Juans bank statements for some sketchy off shore wires comin through.
Elbow...
Boxing lame. Ngannou woulda killed em in a real fight. Ggs after that knockdown.
Do you guys only watch boxing?? "Omg I can't believe how well he took that elbow" Bro are you dumb? He's a Heavyweight Champ in the UFC
Francis should’ve been the winner of this fight
Nobody's going too be honest Fury lost that fight
Such BS decision.  I guess they don’t want to ruin Fury vs Usyk.
if only this was the octagon that knockdown would have been more ngannou is a better fighter fury is a better boxer. boxing is one dimensional ufc is 3 dimensional
Francis ATE that elbow like the champ he was that night.
If Tyson Fury would actually do some fucking exercise, he would be unstoppable.   He looks like shit. He needs to train harder, lift weights, run, and basically do all the things that other boxing champions do, instead of eating hamburgers and talking trash.
He didn’t tire out like Conor did and pressed the whole nite. Good for him. Tyson took him way to lightly and should have stopped him as we all thought but didn’t. Fuckin slacker.
Wow Francis, those big gloves must be heavy. 😏
Ngannou won
Ngannou was the better man that night 🌙.  I always  cheer for fury but this time fury looked like a novice and Ngannou like a world champion 🏆.  I honestly think Ngannou got robbed. But in boxing there's always politics.  I guess in order to beat a champion you really have to hurt him bad, and the fight was really closed....Congratulations to Ngannou!!!!
How  did he lose what score cards was they watching
Francis won.  Smh
Fury is fat, sloppy and out of shape and a cheater.
Fury is the most overrated POS boxer that ever lived. He lost two fights that the refs gave him.
Ummmmm, how many points were deducted for the illegal elbow? Just sayin
They both suck and just use their weight and height
racism is still alive humans, wake the fuck up
So did Tyson actually help train Francis, or was that all part of the promotion
Robbery
Awesome Debut  but they didn't have to rob him like that though.
with a bit more training he would win a rematch
My man literally licked his lips on that elbow straight gobbled it down
That’s crazy
Man they cheated Francis and everyone know it 💯
What😮?
The Great White Nope…Where y’all Tyson dick riders at now?…Cheating ass mfs!!!
Trash
No one who knows anything about boxing could find 5 rounds to give Ngannou. Just because the rounds Fury won were much quieter rounds doesn’t mean Fury didn’t win them, and it definitely doesn’t mean that those rounds shouldn’t count on the scorecards. If people don’t like the 10 point must system that they’ve been using to score boxing matches over the past 50 years then try and get the rules changed.. However, at the end of the day just because Ngannou won the drama of the event and performed much better than everyone expected, and Fury obviously didn’t take it serious enough doesn’t mean Fury didn’t win. Fury clearly outboxed Ngannou in 7 out of the 10 rounds. The only judge that scored it correctly was the judge that scored it 96-93 for Fury. The other two judges who scored it 95-94 for each fighter went out on the limb and gave Ngannou every round they could. Therefore, all the people bitching and complaining about the scorecards should really take a step back and rethink where their saying, or watch the fight over again, and then comeback and offer their opinion regarding which fighter they think the judges were giving the benefit of the doubt too because if they were giving it to anyone it certainly wasn’t Fury.
Francis was ROBBED and that’s the bottom line
96 93 is fucking stupid
Francis Definitely shocked the world, he’s got it, just needs a little more technique and he should be solid. Tyson Fury still looked more technical but I think he needs to built a little bit of more muscle. His punches were landing solid but they weren’t having any effect on Francis lol
Very impressed with Francis 🤘🏼
I still can’t believe how many’s wins Fury has when he’s built like a Store Manager at Basspro Shops
they worked him SMH 😮
Francis seems to be all around the better of the two 🤷🏻‍♂️ including being in better shape lol
They cheated
So fury gets knocked down and throws an elbow and wins.  Makes sense.
Who invited Messi and srk there?
The Cameroon lion won and they decided to hand the Bell to the UK boy. "We no go gree ohh! "
In boxing you have to knock out the champ or lose the decision
Boxing rig more matches than the nba nowadays
Anyone who knows Ngannou's story knows he literally risked his life several times over trying to escape Camaroon, and eventually spent time in a Spanish prison, all to pursue a boxing career.  He transitioned to MMA because he was homeless and a gym took him in.  But at 37 he finally realized his dream and had his Rocky moment.  Imagine what Ngannou could have accomplished if he had been able to start earlier.  And boxing fan Dana White had the audacity to imply Ngannou was afraid to stay in MMA because of Jon Jones.  EDIT: Many in the comment section misinterpreted my Jon Jones comment.  There have been zero fatalities in the UFC and perhaps two dozen in the entire sport.  Francis Ngannou has faced death itself.  In 2022 there were 23 people killed for rushing the Spanish/Moroccan border.  The same place where Ngannou crossed over before he found himself in a Spanish prison.  The thought that Ngannou quit MMA because he's afraid of losing to Jon Jones is laughable.  Ngannou isn't afraid of losing to Jon Jones or even getting injured by him.  Those things are trivial to a person who has challenged death many times over.  A loss to Jon Jones is not a big deal.  There's no shame in losing to the best and with his history there will always be doubt his victory was clean.  Ngannou felt he could make more money in boxing and he was right.  Dana White did his best to devalue Francis Ngannou.  It's embarrassing to have your current champion walk out and I don't blame Dana for trying to minimize Ngannou but felt the implications of cowardice were going way too far.
Francis won 🤷🏾‍♂️
This looked very fake
What a joke in boxing
I am a big Fury fan but Francis got robbed.
Damn Tyson had get beat up 💯
You can see it in his eyes he knows he lost
Fkn racist robbery
Ngannou got robbed
How is this #1 trending if Ryans tiny home video made twice the amount of views in half the time?
Split decision win was a saving face moment for WBC.
Shouldnt he have won because of the elbow? No points off for that?
Fake news 😮 rematch and make the opponent richer,Fury is to old and he needs to retire , I think he’s wife will say the same.I thought show business was over I guess it still exist.Fake news,fake show business.
Once Ngannou gets accustom to letting them hands fly, the heavyweight division better be on notice. Fury simply couldn’t hurt him. Rematch is necessary.
KCUFTAF
THESE FIGHTS TODAY IS RIGGED NOTHING LIKE WHEN MIKE WOULD KNOCK OUT..
10 million dollars, dgaf who wins
@0:53 Fury was trying to cause a cut with his elbow so he can keep hitting Francis in it to open it up badly.
Tyson lost lowkey
Il y a de l’injustice, on a vole Ngonnu, c’est lui qui a gagné le match, ce sont mafiats qui dirigeaint ce match. Bravo à Ngonnu, qu’il soit fier de lui, c’etait le grand gagnant.
Pure robbery 😧
All you haters that wanted Floyd to get in the octagon after beating Conner's ass boxing, start a petition to get Fury in the Octagon with Francis 😅😅
I think Wilder could K.O. Francis but I think he might be scary to most other heavyweight contenders.
I think ngannou should have worked the body a bit more in the early rounds and then went for the knockout later on it might have kept him down. but maybe they will rematch not bad for how it was supposed to turn out
rigged
Francis is one of the baddest men on this planet fr.
Just based off of watching young Mike Tyson, and comparing that to the older Mike Tyson... I feel that Ngannou is at a place with himself that old Mike Tyson is at now. Young Mike was not at peace with himself, or secure in his own skin. He knew he was a monster when it came to physicality, mental warfare and aggression, due to his struggles, and fed his own flame (with technical boxing training). Ngannou basically has the back story of bane, yet he was not angry about his struggles. He seems to be at peace. Old Mike seems to be at peace with himself. I think it's a match made in heaven. A young specimen at peace with himself, training with a person who was once was a ruthless gladiator who finally came to peace with himself.
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
If they caught that elbow Francis would of made history that night. He the real champ and brave individual proud of you brotha
How is this sloppy out of shape holier than thou dude the WORLD champion? Are you kidding me? I literally stopped watching boxing when Mike Tyson retired so forgive me I’m definitely not up to speed. But watching this fight tonight I could literally see Mike Tyson trained him! The patience and game plan were unmatched. Congratulations Ngannou on your win tonight! If Fury was a true champion he would of never accepted that win.
Fury is a dirty fighter, I sure believe that elbow was on purpose. Had 1 been thrown by Francis it would have definitely   been a problem.
Francis won this fight
Fury is overrated. If he can't lay on you he's ineffective.
They got to run that back
Boxing have become a joke where does these big fat guys keep coming from.
Fury threw an elbow in the fight look it up
This should have been light work for Fury 🤣🤣 Ngannou tagged that ass boy!
Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me - John 14:6. I felt led to share this with you all 🥰
another robbery
Mike Tyson must be proud.
Hey we still get paid, and we won this fight.
Corrupcion thats why i don’t watch sports
Tyson Fury lost that fight but he's the champ so you have beat him up to win the Belt..
He knocked tyson down with a top of the head punch thats power
Fight was kinda ass not gonna lie
Money talks with the Sheiks....
L
I WAS WRONG FRANCIS WHOOPED HIS ASS... WHO WOULDA THOUGHT HE WOULDA DONE SOO WELL.
You woulda thought fury would have worked em. Had decent jabs. But this just shows highlights on how Francis should have one. And that elbow was clearly purposely thrown. This makes boxing something to laugh at right now. Francis might as well go pro. Give us something to watch
Francis won button.
Remember this, ur the challenger so make sure you will put him to sleep otherwise the victory always will go to the champion
This was a purely entertainment fight only. Both fighters had scripts to follow and both knew that outcome. It was all for the money. Anyone that didn't think Fury was going to get the W is mentally retarded.
Iv been kicked in the jaw by a shin and knocked out till my back hit the mat and we finished the fight but do u think being hit on top of the noggin like fury really made him look around silly like that ? Not saying the knock down wasn’t legit but the looking around like he was dizzy looked kind of fake to me lol
Francis should've won tho. It is a champion but ge couldn't take those powerful punches by the ufc beast.
ESPN is going to try to control the narrative as well. They have to protect the image of boxing
Keep it America wouldn't have this type of Problem.  Clearly the Saudi paid and wanted HIM TO WIN!
Let’s see ngannou vs Paul next!
Boxing gay
How did Ngannou not get destroyed?  Utterly incredible.
That shit is bought asf he clearly slept his ass
This nigga Fury fight dirty and still won this is beyond me 😐
He ATE that elbow😂
B.S. Cheatin Ass M.F.
Robbery bruh off top
Now let's put Fury in the octagon and see what happens. He is a fighter he can adapt.
Crooked world of boxing....what a shame
Francis did amazing!!
That "knockdown" wasn't even a real knockdown in my opinion. You can see Fury was already moving in the direction of the punch so the punch basically just made him fall due to where his legs were. What I mean is that he didn't fall because he got rocked, he fell because his feet were in the wrong place at the wrong time. At the end of the day Fury landed 71 of his 223 punches, while Ngannou only managed to connect with 59 from his 231 attempted shots. Not only did Fury land more shots but he landed more shots with less attempts. Fury won this definitively and the 1 judge who gave it to Ngannou should retire.
Dude walked through that elbow
This is exactly why boxing is full of shit
Tyson Fury lost the fight and all credibility
REMATCH OR NGANNOU vs AJ...... Fury vs Anyone but Francis DOES NOT MATTER ANYMORE ‼
Low key some bs bruh. We all know Ngannou won that
In a real fight there’s no man alive beating Francis ngannou
Bro who are these saudis in the ring lmao, u know they got $$$
What a pathetic joke the heavyweight division is today.  These guys are fat, slow, no talent clowns who can't box a lick.  The left hook that floored the great white hopeless couldn't have dropped Martha Stewart.
Nick Diaz did a great job teaching Ngannou boxing 🥊
Pssss fuch him. He dog s gushin
I can’t believe people in the comment section thinks this fight was not rehearsed. Fury and francis act their part. It was not a real fight, fury would have him knocked out in less than a minute. Most people believe it was real, i guess thats a good promotion for the fight, they got people talking about them now. Their market value for future fight now got bigger.
People need to relax about this fight. If you have ever watched Fury in previous fights, it is quite obvious he isn't going after Francis at all. He just stayed on the defensive and rarely targeted Francis's head. He wasn't taking the fight seriously. After round 4, Francis was completely gassed. If Tyson wanted to finish the fight, he would have.
Im confused right now... Wtf!!!!!!!!!...
they robbed the homie ..as usual 😒 right on anyway ✊🏿
The announcer, “OOOOHH, HE CATCHES HIM OFF GUARD!” 🙄 he clearly saw that punch coming 😂
Francis got robbed period
Boxing is phony
Why they cut off the first 2 rounds ? Francis dominated
Tyson really needs to lose some fuckin weight man
John 3:16
Francis should have won that. I’m mad the judges cheated
I'm black but I grew up around mostly whites so I don't mind that Tyson Fury won.
That elbow was crazy as well as that knock down ... This was highway robbery ...
Shows how overrated beyonce wilder is
Ngannu won this fight
Francis gave a good accounting of himself. Respect!
Francis won.
Dang when are these Boxers are gonna come into the MMA world 🌎🌍🌍
He lost lol
If they actually penalized for the elbow like they should have this fight would have been won for francis
Who is the Arab guy lol
Best comment section yet! No crying from anyone
Who wants to see Francis vs Wilder before Tyson vs Francis 2?
I didn’t like Francis dancing over Fury after he knocked him down. Act like you been there before, even if you haven’t. Show some class. Although I understand you we’re excited
......this is why mma took over. Garbage.
Love all the fake comments on here, when people should be outraged that Francis got cheated, but hey youd say I'm being political. Not in my sports
Fake ass Division
There is a reason why they prefer UFC fighters to box with boxers than boxers fight with UFC fighter in the UFC the UFC fighter has more chances of beating a boxer in boxing than a boxer beating a ufc fighter in the ufc
Tyson didn’t take this fight seriously and it should have cost him.
Robbery!
Tyson a master boxer only won by 1 point, nah that's a huge L for boxing
That shit looked gay
Yeah, he going back to UFC.
Fury looked sluggish, got knocked down 👇 in the 1st round, then throw an illegal elbow too his opponent's face. Come on Fury, that's not how a world championship 🏆 boxer 🥊 represents this sport. The Opponent clearly won this fight
Now do MMA.
No more these types of fights happen, the more they're looking like a sham
If they gave it to Francis, it would show what a farce boxing has become, a novice boxer can beat a long-standing heavy weight champ.
Nowplaying
Todays heavyweights are trash. Fury will be KO by Zhang.
Robbery In Boxing 🥊 Again!
If ngannou is 6 4 there is no way fury is 6 9
Biggest robbery in modern boxing
so who really won?
Chips 😅
Ngannou shocked us all, and did very well. Made the fight way closer then it was supposed to be but furry won. No doubt it was close but he definitely won. This is coming from a UFC fan.
bullshit
Highlights wack
Accumulation
Robbery
Imagine how good Fury would be if he worked out
📦 is dead
He beat him wtf
Bro
96-93 for Fury is fucking INSANE 😂 WBC just did not want Francis to win cuz it would only help the credibility of MMA and hurt Boxing
Fixed for Fury
Boxing fans needed to be humbled like this.
Lame af Tyson
This decision was bull 💩
Fury sucks bruh that’s a robbery
Ngannou clearly won that fight
00:10 if it was a "real" fight would have been the end of it
Francis is a legend for this!
The decision on this fight shows us that racism will never end smh
How the coach know a win and by 1 point before it was said. Suspect to me
He got respect from the Gipsy King!
Never thought the boxer would hug more than the ufc guy
Let’s not get too carried away.   Fury was clearly not at his best in this one.
No ahi forma con ese britanico
Why don’t Tyson’s  gloves do that weird floppy thing anymore?
You don’t have to go the bank to witness a robbery
How?! When his 🍑 got knocked down.
Aw cmon ppl. Are we gonna act like Fury wasn't pulling punches and just doing this to entertain us?? "Top notch" Fury puts Francis away while putting on a clinic. This was "look like he got off the couch" Fury. But good both for being good sports
Man ..we all know,who won.... this crap rigged
For Fury a knockdown is nothing to him
Nothing far happened 😮
Elbow looked intentional
Crazy how fury did more MMA moves than ngannou, the elbow and double leg takedown😂
The two guys in white at the end like dont worry we got a fat check for you
I know Fury tried to play it off like the knockdown was nothing but come on. Look at his eyes right when he hit the canvas, he was dazed and confused, then you can see in his eyes he was like in disbelief "oh shit, that just happened".
So why weren’t Fury’s gloves flopping around with every punch this fight?🤔
Fixed fight. Francis beat that fat Fury. Everyone knows it too.
Who would've saw that coming? Ngannou knocked him down, didn't get wailed on, Tyson landed an elbow, and Tyson won by decision..... 👀 we all saw that fight. One judge even said 96 93 Fury. If that doesn't prove its a rigged popularity contest, short of them admitting it, idk what else would.
Francis won that fight. Such a load of horse.
Gotta love how after every big boxing match the clueless fans think one round and one knockdown wins you an entire match lol.
Tyson has incredible stamina and it shows that he instilled some of that. Ngannou sbould be proud; the world is proud of him.
🧢
We need more Francis fight he has talent . Good to have fresh blood in division.
Everyone can clearly see Francis won this fight
Hope everyone see those Arab as they pointed at Ngannou that you are the winner.
Ngannou got robbed. He won that.   Since Fury snuck in that elbow (which Francis ate) now let’s do MMA.  Ngannou makes it look easy inside a round
Elbow deductible
My man Francis got Robbed!
These fights do nothing for me , just not serious enough, fury not in great shape and ngannou not a serious pro boxer , just too slow
Robbery
They cheated him🤔they lies and cheated thru their domination now it’s over.
People hate Tyron Fury now. They will love to see him knocked out next fight for the title. Which will lead to record sales hahah. Savy
FN is a machine, dude is impressive. Fury as always, awkward fighter but very skilled and a beast in his own right.
This was a robbery…
I am an MMA fan…I did not see this fight going the way it did. I actually don’t think Nganno is that good in MMA. Props to both guys.
Rigged bullshit
That’s why I don’t watch boxing. 1/2 a fight, and 100% bull 💩.
Nice fight.. but clearly the guy was robbed of his win. The boxing federation wouldn’t have allowed it 💯💯💯💯💯💯
WHITE MEN LETS GOOOO BABY WE IN HERE
Who do we want to see FN fight next?     Im not betting against FN next time 😂
Fury just proves heavyweight division is talentless
Fury won the bout, Francis won the fight 😭
All respect to FN.
Francis won that fight handidly.  It wasn't even close.  Tyson Fury is such a horrible boxer.  There is no competition in boxing today.
FURY LOST THAT MATCH!!!
Fury defeat is on the way...soon he is a big guy but not for long.
Another Robbery
Dana should be on the hot seat for letting Francis go
Imagine if Fury ever got "in shape"
Tyson fury cheated
This lackluster performance was all about business. They will both make millions in a rematch.
He is hurt the ear drum 🥁 almost pop
BOOOO !  BOOOO !
Robbery
Fury a dirty fat fighter throwing a sneaky elbow during fight
Props to Ngannou. Fury is a total joke. He beat an old Wladimir and an over hyped Wilder. He is fat and out of shape for a pro boxer. Doesn't take the sport seriously. I hope Ngannou continues to box because with a little time and training could clear out that division
I actually think fury lost but it's all rigged
Because of how tall Tyson is, his weak spot is a left hook to the top, right side of his head.
Another bullshit ass decision. Wack.
https://youtu.be/XaZeY60oN3A?si=mtaxF5lOdi6CORkW😂😂
Robbery
I don't think Fury was fazed from the knockdown like other people have been describing. Definitely took him off balance but still a legit knockdown💯
Comment ça 🧐
Tyson was literally TOYING with this dude, he was hardly punching at 50%, if any of you have seen a SINGLE Tyson Fury fight than you’d know know that he could have put Francis on the canvas at any point last night, this was nothing more than a sparring match for him…
👀
This decision was definitely wrong and the elbow shot should have points taken from fury
I’d be embarrassed to call myself a Fury after the last 3 fights Tommy and Tyson have had. Tommy fought KSI and barely won a decision, after illegally hitting the back of his head and getting docked a point (the YouTuber didn’t do any illegal shots, so why the “boxer”?). Fought Jake and barely won a split decision. Then Tyson goes out and also does an illegal shot (elbow) and also barely wins by a split decision. The Fury’s are what’s ruining boxing, they’re at fault just as much as the judges. 3 opponents who weren’t pure boxers and they were lucky to have beaten them. And they’re supposed to be a “legendary” family. HA! Yeah, right. 👍 only reason Ngannou didn’t win is because the payout would’ve been enormous. Dude started out at -1400, meaning you could have bet just $100 and won $1,400. And it’s undeniable that the Fury’s have a lot of influence over the boxing world, otherwise their last few fights wouldn’t have ended in split decision. Even IF Fury did enough to undoubtedly win, he still should’ve lost solely because he failed to get an MMA fighter out of a boxing ring, when he himself walked into that same ring being called “one of the best”. Embarrassing. And I was just starting to like boxing, but this sport is too rigged for me.
This confirms boxins is definitely rigged
Bullshit
Rematch
That’s bull he must be paying people off
I want to see Francis for more top 10 heavy boxers
That's what happens when you're not training hard and taking your opponent seriously, that's when you slip up.
Off balance , hit in back of head. Fury not hurt at all. Outboxed Ngannou the whole rest of the fight. Fury won by a wider margin than judges gave him. sGood fight but not a close fight unless you are an mma fanboy.
10 8 on knockdown  punches landed n control of ring is why fury won but it was close idk how judge gave it to francis
Being out of shape as a professional boxer is insane
NGANNOUUUUU! I'm a huge fan of both guys, and I absolutely expected Fury to machine-gun Francis and entirely outmaneuver him en route to a finish after Francis' gas tank inevitably failed. That knock-down is going to shine up Francis' highlight reel for years; hopefully it will also motivate the MMA gods to finally pay him what he's worth.
That elbow wasn't a mistake
Francis you won!
He was robbed of that fight
No way!! Watch that whole fight. Frances knocked Fury around!
He won, but Boxing is fake.
Bull. Clearly they are blind
Canelo face of world boxing.
Francis is gracious in defeat even though most people think he won. He seems like such a good human being. Hope he just keeps wrecking the fight worlds .
Tyson please workout bro
Who won yall
Francis Destroyed, Humbled and Embarrassed Fury
Dirty ass elbow from Tyson fury and before you say where 🤪 like a idiot it’s at 0:45
Wtf 😳
Fury won, Francis just got all the hype behind him.
Imagine if Francis chose boxing instead of MMA
Bro Fury just straight up elbowed him Wtf…
This was rigged.
Boxings corruption has been totally exposed and its like they didn't even try to hide it.
Yeah mad respect he did well against the champ
ROBBED!!! Boxing is a joke. Francis won that. Tyson knows it. What a dirty sport.
Getting knocked down don’t matter. What matters is getting back up. Getting knocked down don’t mean u lost
francis won that fight
Enyone who don’t see the writing on the wall.   Then are easy people. Because we all know they all planned this. They want money they are pulling wwe style shows.    Their will be a next match. And the money they will make will go into the billions.   It’s crazy.  Fury was throwing flop punch’s.  We are all getting got by both competitors it’s a selling match. So they have another one.   I’m sticking too  wrestling lol this shit is to  fake.  😂😂😂😂😂  😅😅.
highlight was one knock down and espn wonder why they are failing
Fury took it easy fr
These are the highlights from ESPN and furry had nothing offensive. Wtf
Are they going to call the elbow shot
This fight was a scam and a joke
Fury took a page out of KSI’s technic manual 😂😂😂
Definitely clarified one thing , fury would get dominated in the octagon
The “best” heavyweight boxer in the world has to cheat… at his own fucking sport… to beat a first timer.    Lmao. Bad look for boxing.  Fury wouldn’t last 1 round in MMA.
Bullshit!!!!!!!
Jake paul would beat the shit out of Fury
That is not the same fury that fought wilder took it easy
How would you rate Tysons chin?
i need a rematch ngl
L0L
Fury bounced an elbow of Nganous head and he didnt even blink , what a tough SOB.
Wth Francis ko him that should been 10-8 round judges full of shit
Noooooo
Francis has a pick up truck in those hands
Weak highlights espn
Did we just witness Rocky I in real life?
Robbed
The "best," boxer in the world, some consider him all time, won on points from a non boxer. Gypsy Joke
Francis won this shit fuck you Fury knocked down in the first round?! Not much of a champion.... #francistruechamp #boxing #ufc #robbed #truechamp
Fury could not wear Francis down with clinching like he usually does because Francis has grappling experience. Even if he had below average grappling as a heavyweight in the UFC that still makes him a far better grappler then even the greatest boxers without any grappling experience.
He lost that fight he got dropped by a ufc fighter and didn't return the favor
It’s so weird knowing two judges gave 95/94 for Ngannou but third just scored 96/93 for Fury? 😂😂 He reffed a total different fight from the rests of the world!
ppl who say this is a robbery are missing the point. Fury won, its that simple. A close fight but fury won. But the real takeaway is that Francis made him work HARD for that win, and it was in no way a clean win. Fury will have to prove himself all the more when he fights Usyk, and Ngannou has nothing to prove, he came and gave it his all, and shocked the entire world. Francis Ngannou is the baddest man alive.
Ngannou vs wilder is next 💰
Rigged
Shortest & worst highlight ever
Look at those curtain wearing rags....
Looks like Ngannou won....
Robbed
Fury lost bad he got knocked down and beat up every round he never looked that patient
That elbow was intentional
Boxing is officially the circus of the fight world. I will never watch another boxing fight. The judges should be fired and mentally evaluated.
https://www.youtube.com/live/tNaTiIaxHMM?si=qXkNfbttTeDkR2mb
Great fight
Where's the highlights? Too much spent on a single knockdown
That punch from Ngannou was definitely not on the back of the head or behind the ear. It was right above his ear. Clean knockdown.
Ain’t no way Francis is taller and more proportional and athletic at that height
I love how these highlights went out of their way to make Tyson look good but still failed to do so.
Greatest of all time lol. This clown couldn’t beat Mike Tyson at 55
BS 😂😂😂
This man’s  first pro boxing match and he made the contest close ass hell.
He got robbed
Can’t buy respect 🥊 💯
Fuck Tyson fury throwing elbows and shit. Sore ass mf
Did Francis also get knocked down...?😮
Racism
Tyson fury won Francis throw dirty punches i didnt know you can punch your opponent in the back of the head he lost because of points casual mf dont know how boxing works 😂
All these MMA fans tryin to say francis won is ridiculous asf..If you take away the one knock down francis lost every other round..It’s easy to see who won when yur a true boxing fan.. This fight wasn’t even close fury easily won..But francis could’ve won he didn’t throw enough punches and didn’t go after fury…Fury was the one engaging and making it a good fight..If fury fought like francis it would’ve been a boring fight so props to fury for going in there and throwing against the hardest puncher of all time.. You can’t say francis won just because he did better than you expected..
these social media fights are becoming boring now.
All sports Rigged as usual
I love boxing, but the business is ruining the real meaning of boxing.
Francis was walking him down.. that is so crazy that he didn’t win, wtf
Francis i thought was really good i admit hes better than i ever imagined.this made the MMA proud fasho
Was scripted from the jump 😭but Francis could have a career in boxing 🤷🏽‍♂️
Look how close he was to fury with the belt before the decision crazy 😂
To anyone who didn't think Francis had a punchers chance, you don't know boxing.
Say something about Francis Nganou’s fight IQ guys. Driving Fury around the ring.  Fearless. The true African spirit. Tyson was weak man, almost 5 inches taller and Nganou sent him to the ringers. I doubt he’ll want to fight Francis again. The latter was more professional, Tyson was just breaking the rules.
Francis knocked him down but Wilder had him out cold for past 10 seconds 🥶
What in the world? The debut against the BEST and loat to a split decision? Lets turn tables around ,… there will be no split decisions.
how did furry win???? cause it look like in this highlight reel furry was getting worked???
No one takes an mma fighter seriously in boxing.
If Mike Tyson had have trained Tyson Fury instead of Francis, we would have seen a fight for the ages..
He just peoved the power of dreams. And never to stop when its ur dream.. not anyone else's.. and the fact dana white wouldnt let him do what he let mcgregor do.. shows something.. bug loss for ufc.. but ifykyk
Man got robbed
If you're a person of color, the judges are going to give Tyson Fury the win, and  it's obvious at this point. They cheated for him against Wilder in their first match. Tyson was down longer than the ten count.
WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP!!! 😅😅😅😅
He didn’t “win” but he won. He’s got life changing money now. He made it.
Fury was the only one battered and bruised even though Ngannou was elbowed smh. They cheat people for fun
Lol tyson fury sucks. I think he's an awesome person but he sucks at boxing. He relies on his reach/height and power. There's no actual skill
Gotta win by tko or ko to win the belt
That elbow was blatant. Dirty.
Never underestimate dad bods.
Fury's dirty always has been always will be. Boxing was scared so fury won. Even gave him a round he got dropped lol. We all know who won
Robbery
I’m wondering if Fury even trained hard for this fight. Always joking around and almost lost. All fun and games til you lose
Injustice contre le camerounais
Nganu was better than Furry
Fury did not win that wtf
Nah ngannou won
Amazing naganuuu won
Seems one of these judges was clearly biased based on the score pattern. Tyson looked like he didn’t take this seriously. Been in heavy on the chubby treats
Alot of just standing around and not alot of punches thrown. Francis, u literally bad a chance to knock him down and go home.
Alot of haters on here.. Plenty of people feel the whiteboy had enough to take the V..Plain & simple!  Go cry to someone else haters! 🤣😂
What?
Boxing is fully rigged, never watching again
I don't think Fury trained properly for this fight he looked tired early. Nhannou obviously gave it his absolute all. I think a rematch with Tyson taking him seriously goes way different and not good for Ngannou. I would LOVE to see Ngannou fight Wilder or Luis Ortiz
Has more cardio than McGregor.
If he spent a few more days learning that drill with Tyson on how to step in to range and bomb, stepping sideways, and inward, we would’ve seen a one sided fight. That speaks volume on the skill of Francis ngannou. He is gonna be trouble if he decides to trade in the mma gloves for boxing gloves.
Let's see #jakePaul fight #ngannou great MMA fighter to challenge
This is a about as real as a jake Paul fight
Robbery!!!!!!!! Tyson fury along with the judges are Trash. Trash event too. Should have been in Vegas.
Nigganaw won
Idk man that elbow looked intentional
what a stupid fight they took people for idiots to watch this fight  to make money this is less than exhibition fight all the fighters of UFC want to box because there is less damage and make more money
I seriously can’t believe Ngannou actually beat fury I was shocked watching it happen
96-93?! Must have been the same judge from the first GGG/Canelo fight🤦🏻‍♂️
Nagganou has to be more active and choppy with creating punch points and not just going for the open knock down punch...
In what fucking world did Tyson win that shit. It doesn’t take an expert to look at Tyson’s face compared to ngannou’s and determine who won 💀💀💀
Usually mma guys don’t translate if Francis had more hand speed this fight isn’t close
Fury is never fighting AJ 😂 if fury can’t back you down hold and smother you he’s almost like a novice. He doesn’t have that fast jab, quick feet elusiveness anymore. His age and inactivity is showing. I pray fury and AJ get it on. AJ by KO
Y’all know damn well fury wasn’t even trying 😂😂
Ayo they straight up robbed my boy Francis no cap !!! Idk what fight the judges were watching but I saw a clear ass whipping handed to Tyson from Francis smfh I hope to see Francis back in the boxing ring soon though because hes definitely proved that he can box real talk !!! 😡😤💪🏾✊🏾✌🏾💯 !!!!!!
Bravo 🎉Francis
Heil
Francis sportin the Tyson black trunks 💯🤙
Francis is not human tyson landed the cleanest elbow ever and francis just ate it completely💀
Left hook was so perfect and so clean
That not fare tyson lose the fight
This fight is definitely a JOKE.....how can Fury win? He's not even in shape, hes all flabby..,.....and the other guy is ripped with a 8 pack. 😂😂😂😂😂
There's no other heavy weight that could beat Francis and honestly if they rematched he would destroy fury... But Tyson is such a beast cause ain nobody else that could take those punches from Francis like he did!!
I wanna see all these boxers try out mma  for a change. It's getting old seeing cage fighters go into boxing, Dana needs to get boxers to come into the cage. It'll be a completely different story 😂😂
Boxing is more rigged than ufc.
The 96-93 was even more corrupt and bought off than the other that gave it to Fury by a point.  Oh well we all knew boxing was plagued by corruption and incompetence.
Don't care what the judges say fury lost that fight clear as day.. a child watching it could tell you that.. The difference between Francis and all the other MMA guys is he actually took it serious and learned how to "Box".. He spent real time training with Mike Tyson..
Where the highlights
Wtf how did he win  White ppl is a fuck disgrace
Elbow wad on purpose
Tyson fury is a fraud always has been
Yall didn't want to respect that fury got his ass knocked down and he didn't dominate they couldn't stand the black man beating the white Boi 😮
Whoever scored 96-93 is insane
I assumed Fury would destroy him. I was definitely wrong. I should have lost money on that fight but I guess I can thank the corrupt judges. Welcome to the middle east where all that matters is oil and money. There's no honor in that god forsaken land.
1:47  *THEE BEST*
And tyson fury thinks he beats jon jones. Thats wild
I mean what was that 96/93 judging...
This is the most I've seen fury look beat up. Imo he lost. And it's a sad sight.
Tyson got exposed and he lost this fight
Rigged multi trillion business 😂😂
How do you get knocked down, and throw an illegal elbow, but still win?
Shouldve been a point taken off for elbow
Im so confused. Francis looked like he dominated the match? How did fury winnnn? And im a fury fan...
And once again the world of boxing cheats for Fury and the UK….. no surprise
Not many highlights, was looking for more than that.
They show 2 minutes of ngannu highlights and bro still lost?…..
Francis had a flurry of head punches that looked like it had fury hurt bad in the later rounds.
You simply cant give a guy a win who didnt get the job done , the dude dropped him but that didnt really stop tyson from coming back 100 percent.
Tyson, you are a dirty SOB. We all saw the elbow. You are fckd up. No honor.
https://youtu.be/-l8DO1qyDcA?si=D6IGq-w-nxXC4xdA
Wow, I'm surprised Fury wasn't able to knock that Mellon head racist out.
faked whole fight , Deontay Wilder were killed Francis
That is a big shame for boxing industry . Fury did not really do nothing.
The elbow tho....?
Oh well
Lmaooo people forget Francis can throw that power from short and long distance.
fury wasn't trying
Trash typical shit
isnt fury supposed to lose points from the elbow? he too pussy to fight in the mma but wants to throw an elbow?
THAT's the highlight?  If that is the best of the whole 10 round fight, then it mustve been a boring fight.
This is the most partial of a judgement.Francis was robbed of his strength.Judgment stinks.
Fury got ROCKED💥😴🤛🏾🤣🤣🤣
Ridiculous that Fury let it get that close. Sounds like a crap performances.
robbery
Hats off a promising boxer 🥊
Fuey definitely lost this is bogus this is outrageous i csnt believe this shit
Tyson Fury didn’t train for this fight but is not an excuse and we need a rematch for 2024
You missed Fury’s double leg takedown attempt
Bullshit. Tyson came out of that fight with his face fucked up and hit the ground. Little bitch threw an elbow, but ufc fighters eat that shit for breakfast.
Blatant robbery. L Fury. My boy is not Billy Big Bollocks 😂
Wow
2 minutes of highlights, 30 seconds of one punch from Francis, 45 seconds of the decision announcement, sucky video
That was a nice battle between two BIG dudes! 🥊 #CouldHaveGoneToFrancis
Fury is a big lumbering flabby slugger he's really not a boxer
Robbed 😂
Francis did Phenomenal in there! Arguably won that fight! Tyson did not display any overwhelming skill or power in there…. Let’s see a Rematch ASAP!
Francis won that fight this is why boxing is absolute trash 😂
Fury clearly won, just in the most unimpressive fashion. Ngannou did way more damage, knocked him down, and would've won by virtually any and all non-boxing scoring system. But Fury touched him up with enough jabs to still take most of the rounds. As soon as felt Ngannou's power and realized the danger he was in, he threw his plans for the KO out the window and decided to just outpoint Ngannou. I've never, not in 3 fights against Wilder or any other time, seen Fury this nervous and this cautious for an entire fight. Incredible from Ngannou - he won in every imaginable way... by damage dealt, damage taken, the knockdown, morally. Ngannou literally won in every way except by boxing rules. No issue with the decision,  but understandable why everyone thinks its a robbery. If it wasn't boxing rules anyone with one eye could see Ngannou clearly won. But in boxing, you gotta win rounds if you let it go to the cards.
pura pelea comprada
Es un asco furry perdió
The elbow should of been the end of the match
Fuck out of here u fucking serious this is so fuck up its been rig
Francis got robbed 😆😆😆😆 hope he runs it back
He best fury ass 😂😂😂
I think fury lost that fight personally but they couldn’t give Tyson his first loss in that close of a match up
ngannou was cheated.
I don’t get boxing scoring Francis is the only one that got a knock down in that fight so someone pls explain how fury won
Francis is a damn tank.
So this is the best Tyson Fury brings to the table? I cannot believe boxing has gotten to this.
Tyson is very smart. She knew she couldn't handle melee. So he took it seriously and started earning points and more points. while Francis wanted to knock him out again. since Francis trusts in his blows. But Tyson moved like a butterfly and stung like a bee, so Francis stopped touching him. Francis approved the first one. The second Tyson was already flying and Francis couldn't hit him... here he explains that intelligence beats pure strength
Tyson lost idk how he wasn't deducted for the elbow
Fury just knows how to win fights. It was a harder fight than he expected but still a solid tune up to head into the Usyk camp after nearly a year layoff. The way he uses his opponents to shake the rust off and secure a bag is genius. Now he’s goin into a history making unification fight against a smaller heavyweight in Usyk and he knows exactly what he needs to work on most. Unify the titles, etch his name in history, shut the haters up, and retire as a living legend. Y’all hate him but he’s a smooth operator.
FURY IS SICH A CHEATING PIECE OF SHII FIGHTER ALL HE DOES IS CHEAT
Fuckin robbery
Another robbery
Ngannou is a damn truck
The look on his face “wtf was that?!?”
Bullshit
Fransic should definitely take up boxing more money than the ufc
Hell naw, espn really paid youtube so they’d be on top of mr.beast’s video. 😂
Ngannou won. This is pure mafia. Even TF knows he didn’t win.
I'm sure the most important thing to Francis is, I got paid.
Bs
Yea… francis pretty much won that scored a knockdown ate an elbow. 47 43 fury is madness
Using dirty tactics what a bum
Francis won that fight!!
This some anime shit bro lol. Get trained by an old legend to then fight the strongest guy in your first match. You lose narrowly and the world knows from that moment, you are indeed the main character.
Unbelievable they gave it to fury
Wow they rob the guy! Fury throwing elbows and all. Dirty fighter!
Leaving a comment for the algorithm
FUCK BOXING COMPETITIONS, all this Paul bullshit and now this goddamn Robbery! Boxing as a sport is great, boxing competitions are pure dog shit now. There was no way they were gonna let an MMA guy come in and win heavyweight boxing. THE PEOPLE FUCKIN KNOW
Tyson was knockdown and dazed, then he proceed to kneel down on his knee, hugged Francis's butt, and gave him a blow job.  But he was given the win???
Tyson fury won for sure for throwing more punches. But Francis punches is hella scary and could knock out Fury if he got another clear shot
I WAS HERE
One of the Biggest Robberies of All Time
Tyson is trash.  Lmao
Robbed
Boxing scoring rule got to change , should be shown after half of the fight.. that way who ever is loosing or winning makes sure to try to not to loose or keep winning.! only sport that you don't know the score or who is winning..! needs to change and make it fair..! for both fighters
I think Fury should have come in fatter and softer. What did he do? Train like Buster Douglas did before he fought Holyfield?
Politics that’s all 🥱
No way!!!
That was a really nice fight. Too bad I missed it, I thought this would have been an easy victory for fury, but I admittedly underestimated how good Francis is in the ring just with his hands alone. Hats off to both of these guys. Great job!
Highlights of what ? 5 seconds of fighting
Can we get Francis vs Deontay Wilder now?!?! 🙏🙏
Not only does this make Francis look amazing, it also shows how amazing Floyd is.  When Mcgregor stepped into a boxing ring, Floyd made him look like a fool.  When Ngannou stepped into a boxing ring, he made Fury look like a fool.  I'm seeing a trend, are you?
Deontay Wilder got next??
Francis was robbed
TBH, I'm still surprised that there is still interest in Boxing at this point.  Especially in the Heavyweight division.  I would have to watch the entire fight to see if Ngannou was actually robbed, but considering he did go the distance and had a knock down against the world champion does beg to consider if boxing is corrupt.
boxing  is officially dead
Bro he was robbed and wtf was with that elbow?
Tyson looks like he had the body of someone in a nursing home
They might of sold a soul…or 3
Francis was never going to win by decision.  Never.   The judges were always going to maintain the status quo and score well for Fury, so going into this I knew he needed to knock him out or it would be a loss, simply because of the judges.  I was right, but even I was surprised by how much better Ngannou's performance was than Tyson's.  Even their faces at the end.  Ngannou won this fight.   We all know he did, and regardless of the split decision, this looks horrible for Fury.  Even Fury's next opponent is furious now because he took such a beating their 100 million dollar match will be delayed.  Where's the peanut gallery now?   See that elbow? Perhaps the things Wilder's team had to say about his gloves werent that far off.
Never underestimate the power of a dad bod 💪
Robed
All of a sudden Fury is back to having no power lolol.
It’s exciting that Ngannou is this good. Too bad he started so late in life. Could’ve been a major star in boxing.
If they go by points shouldn't all three points be added up instead of 2/3 decision?! 😊 What's the point of points.  It's as silly as the sport has become
Boxing is the worst
He never had Francis in trouble or hurt, so how did he win.smh
He got chatted
Uncivilized caveman neanderthal savage cheater, and then pretend like he has honor.once a cheater always a cheater.foh
I won , but I didn't beat him. - Apollo Creed
Francis is the last man on EARTH that you'd want to walk down a back alley and find.  What a BEAST. Imagine if he had.. literally ANY sufficient training in boxing
Frantic got robbed
Fury is a clown.
A couple weeks ago I had someone argue to me that Fury would drop Lennox Lewis (my fav fighter) lmao.
Ngannu Fancais!
What were these highlights
Cheated
Tyson and the judges was in cahoots, no doubt about it.
Lots of respect for Francis for sure.  Dude impressed all of us.   I didn't expect him to actually fight that long.  Thought for sure he was gasing out by the 5th lol.  Definitely would like to see him fight Wilder , get some experience in  boxing, and I'd bet my money he's champ in a couple of years.
Now I really want to see him vs wilder they would both be throwing
As an mma fan I LOVE what Francis did with fury last night..but I can’t help but think to myself..with Tyson fighting usyk so close from today in December, could he have been not trying to put to much tape on himself for usyk to see..almost like a chess play to make himself seem vulnerable? Just a thought cuz it’s really insane to think an mma guy can come closer to beating a legend like fury than other boxers who’ve studied the sport in MUCH. More detail than Francis..congrats either way tho
Dam SHAME
Man got Robbed in Boxing….  How weird?!??
Fury could have gotten knocked out xold and the wbc would have still found a way to raise his hand. Way too much money to be made on december 23rd for heavyweight undisputed.🤔
I’m less impressed by how good ngannou was and more shocked by how horrible fury was, made boxing look like a joke of a sport
Another robbery...that's why more people are watching UFC than boxing..Francis won..I have nothing against fury..but he lost.
Of course the privileged British always are supported more when it comes to the points
Fury knew that francis would let that elbow slide since hes from ufc 😂
Fake fight! One can clearly see Fury was not throwing hard punches, he was just sparring, having fun. When he goes down it is because he was out of balance and not for receiving a dangerous blow... so much more to say...
Good job Francis. What an embarrassment for Fury. Pathetic
Watch the knockdown again.. watch Tyson’s face he’s bracing for the hit. Later Francis throws the same punch but Tyson easily dodged it. This is a bullshit fight.
Judge's couldnt give it to Francis.  To bad
I’m crying
Fight was as fake as a wrestling match
Fury is a joke!  Elbow should have taken points away.
This is rigged
and this is why I don't watch boxing, it's rigged for future promotions for the industry. Francis Ngannou dominated
Fury is a cheater
Fury vs Ngannou 2 needs to be in LAS VEGAS. The gate and US interest will make more money.
Straight corrupt robbery
I don't understand how not many expected Francis to be able to go toe to toe with Tyson there was so many people thinking that Francis was gonna get demolished in this fight but not me I actually thought Francis could win and he did not officially but everyone including Tyson knows he won. Y'all forget that Francis wanted to be a boxer first before he even thought about MMA.
dang he tried to pull a KSI
What a fucking joke
Robbery
Tyson Fury came into this fight out of shape and looked like he didn’t even train at all
Robbery
And this is why MMA is better than boxing… in MMA you hardly see someone get cheated. You know who dominates the fight or who gets knocked the fuck out. They weren’t gonna let Tyson lose… he’s has what SIX MORE FIGHTS AFTER FRANCIS???? How much money is that? And if he lost you think those fights would happen??? Nah boxing is just as rigged as our elections homie… for money….
After this decision I gave up watching “boxing”.
Ik this a short bits and pieces but from what I saw nagounu shoulda won he was throwing more punches that were connecting fury was getting to staggered
Where the authorities at.. somebody has been robbed 😅😅😅
Wilder vs Ngannou
i dont think that elbow was intentional
Robbery
I fuck with tyson fury everything aint what it seems tyson fury is a true warrior
After seeing this Francis should definitely just stay in boxing I could see him beating Anthony Joshua
Even in real life that people are watching discrimination in brought day life. How is he the winner. Too bad can't watch wrestling again the judges are not fair. Too bad. Ngannou won and they gave it to his opponent. The truth is bitter but most be spoken. He won fair and clean. He deserves the medal
Ngannou did such a great job playing to his strengths and knew exactly what he was capable of. Seeing him so disciplined as a boxer is great for the sport, and for him as an athlete.
Scanner
Knocked down, threw an elbow and still won 😂
Fake fight, fury should've finished him. Boxing has gotten so dumb.
Yo tyson knows he lost
Rigged ass decision.
That’s some 🐂 💩
damn it looked like that elbow did as much damage to Tyson than it did Francis' forehead
Black power is real ✊🏾🇺🇸
Francis won that fight
I feel like Francis outbox tyson but the best man wins.  Tyson won 🏆
Robbed
How did Tyson win this despite getting his ass handed to him?
Took that elbow like a G!!!  If Fury gives him a rematch and we can only hope that he does that next fight is going to be Box Office
these two should never step foot in a ring again. both looked trash and slow. usyk and aj the best ones this decade.
Fury definitely didn't take this fight seriously. Obviously he didn't train as much as he should have.
I told y'all boxing fans Francis has better boxing form and is technically better than Wilder. Wilder lives up to his name the Bomber but that's all he is. Just a Wilder swinger who stumbles around when he throws big shots. Francis definitely doesn't do that. And look, he drops Fury. Plus Fury said he was going to finish Francis and he couldn't do that. Tyson Fury is to use to hanging on to the clinch and weighing his opponent down to gas them out. But he couldn't do that with Francis. They weighed pretty much the same thing and he was only an inch shorter than fury. Francis DEFINITELY BEATS WILDER!!
They robbed my nigga
Was behind the ear
Between the knockdown the illegal elbow that should have been a unanimous decision for Francis
Big congrats to Francis!!! If those were mma gloves , down goes Frazier!!!!! Lol with an intentional elbow I think and he still kept going?!? Mannn step into an mma fight and we’ll see
Que robo 😂 🤔🤑🤑🤑🤑😵😵‍💫👿
Fury is garbage  I don't  know why they keep letting  him get away  with the shit he does  he hit that man with a str8 elbow.  They r pay these  judges to give fury the wins he got sloppy built  . But he still heavyweight champion  Gtf out a here.
Already shows way more boxing skill than Wilder….while having all the power
The fact he knocked him down should of won the split in my opinion
This match proves Boxing is a corrupt sport
No one’s gonna talk about the leg like bruh what!?
Holy crap these guys are HUGE
Tyson fury is a joke and lost this fight .
Knock downs don’t count on non color
Fake knock down??
Even the highlights from this fight are of Francis landing more and Tyson landing an illegal elbow. Francis went 10 rounds and ate an illegal elbow and walked out Unscathed. Francis won this Imo.
They robbed Francis 🥱🥱
Look at that saudi slime ball with the belt. No one in that ring deserves any respect lol
Did the Arabs buy a boxing org? Wonder why the dude was holding the belt
Fury got washed and then handed the victory. Reason being? The father of all nations the UK has total control and will never let a black man be the champ.
Francis too a mean mf elbow too I’m surprised it was let go it looked intentional to me
Mad respect to Francis,Fury BARELY won
Lots of respect to both guys. What Ngannou was able to do kind of goes without being said. Incredible performance. But at the same time I also give a little bit of credit to Fury bc I think he was caught very off guard by Ngannou and still managed to weather the storm and remain composed regardless of who everyone thinks won the fight.
Bullshit… Gypsy King ain’t shit Big ups to Ngannou.  Excellent job!
Rigged. In no world did fury win that fight.
The fact people believed this fight wasn't set up, is ridiculous!!! The punches where light, the knockdown on tyson was a blatant set up. But hey, we just roll with this crap today
Hell of a fight. Both em of are bad asses. Much respect to em boys 🫡
Fury knew he didn’t win
Franchement c’est honteux cette victoire
Crazy Ngannou nearly won in the boxing ring, imagine what would happen in an octagon
nice elbow
Pathetic fight
Racist decision 🤦🏻‍♂️
Boxing proves once again it is bullshit. That elbow would have cost fury.. can't ahbe that happen tho.
Beautiful work by Ngannou. Hell of a fight for both guys. Francis definitely proved himself
but i dont undertand how come Fury was the one who won  is not possible because Francis hit him down
Are we all watching the same thing or is this some butterfly effect if I ever seen one Ngannou got robbed and no one sees that all this respect most of y’all are bias due to race it will always be expected
Francis is the baddest mfckr on the planet! He won period…Dropped this big dozer & made him look like an amateur 😂😂 Boxing has robbed countless men of victories …Also if this was an MMA Fight Francis eats Fury in 1 minute of the fight
Shame on Fury😂
Boxing is trash now
That cold. Fury got whooped
Uhhhh!!!!!! FRANCIS won that shit!
Francis won
FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART, IF FRANCIS IS SO BAD THEN WHY DIDINT HE DROP HIM AGAIN? THE WORLD CHAMP GOT HIS ASS UP!!!!!!!  FRANCIS COULDN'T EVEN BEAT AN ALMOST O.G. THAT ISNT IN TOP SHAPE. I COULD SEE THE SADNESS IN YOUR EYES CHAMP BUT HELL NO, DONT BE SAD CHAMP!!!!!! YOU ARE OUR CHAMP!!!  FUCK THESE MOTHER FUCKERS. GONE.
Fury had that look on his face like “here we go again”
This sport is a joke
Fury is so Tricky.. elbow jjjj He feel Francis power ✊👊
Bro gets knocked down then throws a elbow and somehow wins thats robbery id say francis won.... i say rematch in MMA next?
Francis v. Paul when?
Wait boxing is rigged? Never heard that before
Thats for WILDER PUSSC
Mike Tyson made a Beast out ove an animal 😮🤜🏾🤛🏾🫵🏾☝🏾👊🏾💯
The Ukraine guy would've beaten him easy.
Fat Tyson tried a straight elbow like a fat weasel. And still won and they didn’t deduct points. Completely fixed
Honestly he got rubs
Bull shit
Francis is the baddest man on the planet
Fury try to hit him with the elbow...
https://youtu.be/NCweK30AqAQ?si=8gow3tYPAK8MEgUv
Fury mustn’t have trained hard,should’ve been easy work. He will make the adjustments and kill him next time or maybe Francis is the real deal. Dude did his thing
Robbed
They always have to give it to the undefeated champs I am a huge fan of Fury but Ngannou really showed out this match.
I feel bad for the people who thought this was a real fight 😂
whats the big surprise. people saying its his first fight asa boxer and he did great. dont forget!!!! he is a pro fighter either way you look at it.  now if some random guy off the street did that to fury then ok i would say its miraculous.  but Francis is a pro fighter
They didn't want an MMA fighter to win that lol
Yall say mayweather won cheating fights lol NO THIS
Right at 0:53 seconds on that replay I lost ALL respect for Tyson Fury as a fighter. The sport of boxing don't need fighters that throw elbows at opponents with ill will intended. Slowed replay, and the intent is clear.  F*** you Tyson.
I like Fury but I feel Francis won that fight
This days boxing is a joke. How you can lost the very close fight with the knock down your opponent. Mind blowing decision you know why because if Francis even tide this fight for boxing word it will be disaster but anyway it’s. Word champ my as*
The Gypsy King ran into the Wakanda King 😂
How could boxing allow a MMA fighter to win in a Boxing world. Francis had to KO fury. Only way. Its just how it has to go. Sadly.
Ngannu got gipped
Scammers
AN ELBOW THO WTFFFFF
BS fix. Total crap.
Vegas wins
Fury needs to realize his power is not S tier. He’s improved it but he just doesn’t have that fast twitch heavy power. He needs to fight more like Larry Holmes and wear guys down behind a punishing jab and not back up in straight lines. He can’t clinch these superheavy guys that he can’t muscle around, that will get him knocked out. Francis should fight Wilder and Joshua.
If you think Fury won this, you’re delusional. This is obviously for keeping face. Fury got bodied by someone who has never boxed.
another robbery ... this fury family only knows how to payoff fights cringe
Fakest shit ever ahaha
Gets knockdowned and bullied all fight. Wins decision. Boxing ain’t real bro 😂
His big goofy ass always cheating throwing elbows wild ass
He beat fury bruh. Dropped his dumb ass😮😮
People keep falling for these catch weight fights and get fooled. I hope no one bought this crap.
Robbery hands down 😂😂😂
For being his debut fight, Ngannou did great...and it's also a testament to Mike Tyson's training
😢 garbage 😮
How fury always winning after getting his ass beat
If Francis had a little bit more stamina I think Fury would have been done for.
96-93 is absolutely absurd. That guy doesn’t deserve to judge another match EVER
you cant tell me ts ain’t rigged💀
Francis had a better performance than Wilder
Fury's eyes said what the fuck after that knockdown.
The match was rigged
You really can barely tell that fury is taller than gannou
This was an absolute robbery
Salute  to Francis  Mad Respect  2 him
BRO WHAT !!!
How he win that fight this shit rigged Francis whooped that boy and furry was the one throwing mma skrikes how ironic
I know wilder is an after thought at this point but this proves had he just worked on his technique he’d still be champ . But unfortunately do to his own ego he depends and only utilized his strength . Francis has been trying to get his form/ technique right and he barely lost .
Massive respect for both of these titans of men
Ngannou is definitely built for this... needs a lil more time to sharpen his skills, & dude can definitely compete with the best of them! That power is no joke...
Francis beat the brakes off that goofy pudgy clown, what a let down of Judge decision
I'm glad he is at least getting his respect Francis won that fight hands down if we are gone to be honest about it but great fight to both fighters
When's the rematch?
Always been a huge fan of Mr ngannou always a class act , humble and just nice , now there is no dispute about the man's hand to hand skills
Boxing is fake as hell
That’s a robbery Francis had that all day
What’s with Europeans elbowing
Fury didn’t deserve it boxing is so wack now
Wack Fury loss
Big trending
Im convinced francis hits hard asf
Came here for the highlights, in todays boxing world there is no such thing. Boxing is done.
Tyson kinda a dirty fighter fr
In MMA Ngannu would've stopped fury in the first round
Did i just see the first Rocky movie happen.?😂
Francis wins.
Rigged
Fuck ur highlights , they dont wanna show Frances whooping buddys ass
That knock down was just lucky in the right spot. His hand literally bounced off his shoulder. JS
The Predator is a true phenom in combat sports. Francis last fight he went in with a torn MCL and went 25 minutes in the Octagon to defend the UFC Heavyweight Championship against his former team mate. That was in January 2022 and his first fight back is in boxing versus Fury. Francis is an exceptional human being. 💯🦄
"Raped the shit out dude"
Dammmmm!! Okkkkk Francis!! 💪💪 they both won that night!!
Worst "sport" ever...rigged
This damn near a MMA fight the way he throwing elbows and going into the  clinch doing dirty boxing
Francis is simply amazing.  His life story is a Hollywood movie!!
What did we learn? Francis was better.
Francis did amazing especially for a very close win I was very surprised on how good Francis did
So this is what a robbery looks like in real time 🧐🤨
Francis was robbed
Yea this is youtube creator clash shit.
FRANCIS!!!!! wow you did it man!!!!, you didnt win, but you just skipped straight to the championship fight and almost Won. Amazing!
So it's clear the judges love fury's first it's his son and now him win over
I can't remember a time when boxing's heavyweight division was weaker.
Why are all of you acting like this was a clean fight? Yall are Sus.. the man francis won and you all "good job buddy" buncha weirdos..
Fixed
Grabbing and hold ad elbows got his aZZ KICK BAD
Fury is a dorser
1 min highlight for a 30 mins fight lmfso
The gypsy King looks more like burger king
Mas respect to nagaunau but that hook was straight up behind the head. That's killed people. But then again fury straight elbowed him lol
Look at Fury’s face at the end. We all know who really won
When tyson beat wilder you had flocks of wh?te basement dwellers lauging at Wilder....now the same ones are hiding and crying like Bitche$
So they allowed a elbow and a knock down and still lost sounds about right.
I don't particularly care for either fighter but Francis should have been the victor wtf are those judges smoking
Fury’s such a dirty fighter
If fury fights like that against usyk he won't win
I felt like there was no promotion with this fight. I woke up this morning saying..”Holy 💩 they fought & I missed it.” 🤷🏽‍♂️
That’s one hell of a fight, and he gave Tyson fury, more and more of a fight than Deontay Warlow however, you say his name his last name sorry but this African really gave it to him
boxing lost credibility with this one..
This is the story of Gigglamash
Wh?te boiz are mad 😂😂😂
What Bullshit
Wow white supremacy again 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fury been a dirty fighter in ways
Man if fury actually was more athletic nobody could touch him. And dude jus looked uncomfortable out there, kept fixing his shorts and jus looked out of shape.
I think Tyson was really hurt by Mike Tyson training Ngannou…even more than he openly admitted. Like…I would want to change my name. Tyson Fury and his dad have been poking at Mike Tyson for a while now. I don’t understand the logic.
😂😂😂😂😂K. O
This was a show. Why do so many think it was a real fight.
LOL at all the boxing armchair experts saying Fury would beat Francis in a street fight.  Francis arguably just beat Fury at his own game, Fury wouldn’t stand a chance in a real fight.
If Francis got into professional boxing he could win a heavyweight belt
Tyson made an animal
Rematch?
Robbery
It’s their world, iykyk.
Francis didn't take Iron mike body body upper cut technic
Gotta love Ngannou. Hes a really aeesome guy too and humble. Amazing competitor
now i want to see Ngannou fight Jon even more 😞
Ngannou is an mma fighter that elbow didn’t even phase him 😂😂😂 dirty boxing is nothing to an mma guy.
Look like Tyson lost to me but ok
Circus act
Vi la pelea eso fue un arreglo. Por cosas cómo está uno deja de ver deporte. La pelea más fea.
Francis won that
Francis’s story was already INCREDIBLE, now add that he gets trained by Mike Tyson and beats the Heavyweight champion of the world
Someone Check on my extremely greedy and smug cousin Dana White
He did much better than Deontay sticklegs Wilder. Lol
Definitely should have lost a point for that elbow tf
Boxing is rigged
Fury should have lost a point for that elbow. Could have been the pivotal point in making the other man the winner. I like how he just ate it though and didn't flinch.  I'm a boxing fan only but Fury embarrased us. Give a rematch and remove all doubt before going forward with unification bouts.
Tyson made an ass out of himself. He looked obese,  disgusting overall out of shape ( not if he ever was in shape). He’s just milking his fame. Shame on him.
I think fury underestimated ngannou and got hurt early in the fight and almost costing him the fight lol
Ate that elbow like a snack. Not even phased.
How disingenuous by ESPN… to LT shows highlights from Ngannou and none from Fury…. Then shows Fury with the split decision victory. I watched the fight, how come ESPN didn’t show any of Fury’s highlights? Bias.
should be a draw
I think Ngannou was robbed!! Should’ve been a draw at the least!! 😮💩
More rigged white man Bullsh#t.....😮😅😂
Fake knockdown!!!
His next fight against him he will win
That was a bullshit decision
Wait he didnt get a knock down and STILL won?  Weird
Goes to show how horrible boxing heavyweights are right now. Huge guys with zero skills. Fury is the only heavyweight who can box at all, and he has the power of a featherweight.
Is it me or did Fury not prepare for this fight he looks a pretty soft physically here.
The best showing for an Mma vs. Boxer of the last 10 years. Mauricio is about to put Predator in the top 15 of the Wbc.
Ufc fighters can box
That elbow was super illegal and not totally accidental... wow.
Impressive showing by Francis but he did not win the fight. MMA fans need to calm down. Fury landed way more which why he won.
They need to give Francis more fights. Brings back excitement for boxing.
Rigged fight. Just like the fight between Lomachenko and Haney. Francis knocked fury down and fury still managed to win.
And Ruiz would kill Fury with that sluggish boxing hahaha
Francis won that fight and showed how biased and dirty boxing is.  I guarantee you Týon Fury won't step foot in an MMA octagon with Francis. It would be beyond embarassing for Fury.
This is bullshit
That was a sad display from fury i hought it would be a landslide victory he looked ridiculous in there
WTF??
Chisora would have beaten this fury and most heavyweights. Somethings off with fury and ngannou. Fury wasnt moving like he normally does seemed very slow even his hands. And ngannou who is used to shoet fights and only trained boxing only for a couple months instead of mma and hasnt fought for a year and a half somehow comfortablly goes 10 rounds without being e haused at 38 years old. There are young boxers who have problems going from amsteur to pro bevause of the number of rounds at pro or pro boxers who struggke from going from 6 rounders to 10 . For a muscular guy 1st time in a pro boxing match he seemed a littke too good cardio wise.
We need Francis vs wilder next
Francis won that fight. Judges are full of bs
Racist ass result, its all about gambling. The saudis didnt wanna lose the billions they put on tyson and ruin his career as well. What a joke
So why did the rers give it to tyson!? SOME BA
He got robbed
This fight should of went to Francis. Tyson Fury lost my respect by purposely trying to elbow Francis.
I think fury lost
Great Job by Francis. He opened up a lot of fights and a lot of $$$ for himself with this performance. I thought going in Fury would be too fluid and Francis too stiff----I WAS WRONG!---I did wonder about how serious Fury was taking the fight and thought he came in too heavy and out of shape. Both are true. He will have to be more dedicated and committed going forward if he wants to remain unbeaten.
Francis got robbed
Eminem is just there 😂
I saw 2 fat people fighting. not entertaining.
That fight was rigged as fuck, fuck those stupid fuckin judges
What a disappointing fight. It did have a couple of highlights, Francis knocking down Fury, Fury elbowing Francis. This needs a rematch.
ridiculous, i cant believe it. ngannou was faaar far better
Fury is a cheater. He intentionally threw an elbow that landed and followed with stikcing his tongue out. Ref should've deducted a point. Ngannou won this fight. Fury only won in the eyes of those bias and paid judges but the rest of the world saw Ngannou win.
Can't believe some people think this was a real fight. I have some oceanfront property in Wisconsin I'll sell you real cheap
Where are the tyson fury meat riders ?
Minus one point for the elbow = DRAW
ROBBED
An honest thief would have worn a mask when robbing someone, unlike these judges
Not sure why they get paid so much!? Nothing to watch one is over weighted fat peace of shit another is body builder that can’t even move. Mike Tyson would have knocked both of them at the same time in his prime time! Garbage 🗑️
Him n Wilder got killer power
Wow,  Francis eat the ebow for breakfast lunch and dinner and still came forward the  Future looks bright for him atleats for 2 1/2 yrs of his career are whats left, boxing sucks becuzs these guys are coming over making world champions look like  Amateurs of they own sport, thats bad for the sport of boxing that the Judges had to  Blately mis judge the fight becuzs it was not a good look for boxing, wow congrats own the new heavy wt champion of the world Francis . 👍👍
the whole group of commentators looked like fools , so what happened to the gypsy king the so called best heavy weight throwing elbows , it looks like he went back to that snow
Francis knew he won the fight but respected Fury so much he just took his L and stood with it , he looked more confused then disappointed … Fury knew he lost but of course wants to stay undefeated so was just joyful.
Bullshyt !!
Is that third round punch was a little behind the ear.
We all know who won 😏 but the judges couldn't allow for Francis to win because their life is on the line 😅 them Saudi boys had big money on the fight 🥊
Those Saudis want a rematch, 😅
The 96/93 judge should be investigated
I liked to see deontay vs Francis.  Ahahaa
White guy cheated hard elbow!
I don't see why anyone is surprised that someone with incredible knockouts with his hands, does well in the boxing ring.
That was amazing fight
He got robbed
We Ngannou vs Jones in the UFC.
Lmao Francis just ate this elbow  That mma experience pays off 😂
Was rigged for rematch
Always expect the african to be scammed ! It's a business and he just coming in the top dogs arena. There is no way with what i have seen Fury has won this fight, they the elite behind this business had to protect fury's image. They would have never allow an african to won against fury specially on a first fight with the entire world watching!!! This is si predictable! Nganou proved this fury isn't as good as he thought he would beat Francis like an amateur. Francis taught him a lesson never underestimate your opponent and that alone Nganou can get out of this match knowing he is a champion warriors! See body language will never lie, look in fury's eyes!!! He competely lost confidence after receiving thid humiliation from francis a knock down from francis just a few moment in the match are you kidding me? And they dare said fury won!!!
I'm watching MMA for 20 years, yesterday I teared up watching Francis do what he did and when he knocked Tyson down, I jumped up and screamed from the bottom of my heart. WAR FRANCIS!  Update after the comments: (To those who feel like making fun of me because of my comment)  Everyone once in a while we encounter that guy whose mom never hugged him as a child...They always grow up looking for that attention in the wrong places. Get over it dude. Being a smart ass to complete strangers online is not going to fix what your mom did. Speak to a professional so you don't go around being told you're an idiot cause you don't know how to behave like an intelligent human being. There is help out there.   BTW: Walk away with this thought because this is how I really have the last laugh.  I put $200 on Francis NOT getting KO'd and going all 10 rounds 2 weeks ago. LOL
Another rigged decision…shocking
Fury is like Mayweather now it'll take a knockout for him to lose.
Smh and he was giving fury a onslaught of punches afterwards
So how he lose then
Francis hitting Fury with that Ford Escort power 😂
Francis Ngannou was robbed. Fury got his ass beat
Bro some one tell that fucking Saudi he is embarrassing the world by being there fuck the Middle East!!
Fucking fraudulent
Fury lost they just didn’t want to spoil the fight with Fury va Urysk that would ruin their investments
This is eerily like Rocky 1.
YT supremacy robbery at its best.
dana can sucks Francis d now. f dana slave master
What a dumb highlight. This went 12 rounds all you did was just show francis highlights lol. I get it the viral knockdown the best highlight of boring fight but then just show that and the elbow lol. People didn't actually watch this boring fight.
I don’t believe anyone expected Francis to do as well as he did WOW! Very impressive.
Some sorry ass heavyweights
Tyson said ooo shit when he got knocked down
I thought this fight sucked they both looked like so sorry ass heavyweights
This let me know that if Francis started off as a boxer he would have been unstoppable! He made Fury look stupid. Especially after eating that elbow
robbery but good fight
Ngannou is the man 💯
It’s simple, boxing politics would never allow an mma guy to beat the head honcho of the heavy weight division and arguably the current face of boxing in his first match ever. I love boxing but it’s pure bullshit these days, ngannou beat the dog shit outta fury and it’s clear as day he worked him the whole match
Bullshit decision! Tyson lost...Pure Bullshit!
Great 😂 I was tired of his mouth
How do you know we haven't been played how do you know it wasn't choreographed we don't know and I'm not buying it!!!!!!!!
The zionists at the end telling Ngonnu: We know you got cheated but remember the money we’re paying you. Remember the money!!!
find it kinda funny how all the comments complaining about the decision are deleted. just saying
96 - 93 is criminal....
Francis Won That Fight. He was Screwed Big Time.
Ngannou is the lineal champ
Boxings rigged
Whoever posted these "highlights" was salty a white man won lol
I'll never watch boxing again after this robbery. We all knew boxing judges would never allow an outsider to win this fight. As Chael Sonnen said, boxing is fake.
Even the Fury fanboys have to admit that Francis gave him a run for his money here.  You can make all the excuses in the world for him, we all know Fury didn’t expect any of that.
Still not seeing how fury won..
That elbow was 100% intentional, Gyspy King for a reason.
Those judges were biased
Fury is awful...put him up again Tyson, Foreman, Lewis, Ali, Frazer, etc...he would be knocked out in 2 rounds...
Francis really won he got cheated
Absolute robbery!!!!
This fight overrated asf lmaoo
So we really gone say Fury won? Ngannou got ROBBED
Bro got robbed
Tyson will beat him even worse in the rematch.
Fury a dirty fighter…I head buts are apart of boxing..but that elbow at 0:56 was crazy…no place for that in boxing…if he wanna throw elbow..hop in the octagon
Total respect to Francis for putting it all out there against Fury. Very good contest.
What an amazing man Francis is no crying no being salty if fury wasn’t champ he would have won no question it to be the champ you have to beat him and that was to close for titles to change hands but the rematch Francis will adjust and he’ll get him thought he was gonna do it this fight but i get the politics and the beat the champ motto just not sure he can knock out fury he’s not normal
Why is the champion so fat?
Racism played a part in judging the fight. Francis won hands down
Fury is going to keep quiet for some time to come. He was actually put to shame by that knock down. Now turn the table around and lets see if he could survive Ngannou in an MMA setting. 😮😮
I realized prize fighting and international conflicts are the same. No real beef, just a chance to make a lot of money.
Fury the new Goldberg. Fake no honor. Lames
In shady depth, where honor fades, A barking path of no soul is made clear. They seek advantage, tricks they play, In games like scandalous bastard, where winners are the usual suspects .  But cheating's touch tarnishes the thrill, A hollow insides a victory to yole , a bitter pill in the near future. For true success, in hearts unknown, to the real ones Its earned with honor, brightly shone. from taken elbows and maken KO's Ya'boy was almost Gone LOL  So heed this warning, fair and clear, To cheat and win is not sincere. In games of life, let truth abide, For honest triumph fills yoles pride.WE SAY YALL -you folks say YOLE
Your vid totally sucks.
I love Tyson, but Francis looked so good so good bravo Nganou
Fury being proclaimed the winner just shows how corrupt boxing is.
I promise you if I was a heavyweight, I’ll put him out for the rest of his life
All i seen was tyson get dropped on his ass . Not even the highlights sides with fury 😂
Rematch Furry may train a bit harder!
Problem with fights like these is that the outcome is premade. Even if Ngannou completely dominated Fury he would still lose unless he knocked him out cold. Fury is a big name that took a long time to build and promote to just throw away, sports are ruled by  paid for judges
Rigged
Fight should have been a draw with that illegal elbow from Fury.
I love Tyson Fury man. He’s just a competitor and a DAWG. A shit talker but a great sport at the same time. He showed Francis mad love and even kissed him on the cheek immediately after the bell. Two warriors 💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿🔥🔥🔥
ROBBED 😂😂😂😂😂
both did good , in boxing theres points fury scored a little more .it was close , if u dont finish the champ or beat by alot u wont win thats how it goes . Fury did well too he got hit by the best striker and got up .. dont forget ngannou is the ufc champ of the world and ufc is not joke he sent the best into orbit .. they both did well
Wilder appears to hit harder or
People forget Francis was a boxer way before he got into MMA this fight shows it. Mad skill
Bull butter Tyson lost
Fury Is Lucky This Isn’t UFC , If it Was Francis Would’ve KILLED Fury On The Floor , Now Get Your Ass In That Octagon
Can’t stand Tyson fury 😠dude is a scumbag
Robbery
Rig ass fight boxing should be arrested
Boxing is rip
Watch that knockout all that fat falling down. He’s not in a class of heavyweights that went 15 rounds. They cut to 12 because of no wind fat boys like this.
What a bunch of bs.
Wow!! Literally gave it to furry look at his face, and look at ngannnou’s face 🤦🏽‍♂️ fucking shame didn’t even take a point off for the elbow blind ass ref, shit would’ve cost him the fight right there looking as how close it was, had they just taken a point and ngannou would’ve been the clear winner what a fucking shame, I don’t see him loosing again to furry or anyone if he trains and gets more fights in.
Love these staged fights!
Good fight .. the KO is legitimately shocking.. however when all points are sum up .. Fury still has the edge.
Black man loses  Blacks in the comments: 😢 😭
Work.
rematch
Impressive performance, Francis!
That’s a joke. It’s a race thing.
I know what I saw, did the judges see it?  Lol
Francis is twice the badass that Fury is. This fight seems to prove that he’s just a huge guy that knows how to box a smaller opponent.
Look at their faces at the end that shows what’s up
Francis won the fight, only problem is that if you wanna victory you gotta knock down completely lights out a current champion Francis was trying to do this hard because he know that’s only way to get victory from cordon champion. but not points.
Definitely need rematch
Lmfao Tyson really threw an elbow. Let that be MMA and he'd been gone😂 knock down then ground and pound to oblivion 😂
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Regardless of how you feel about the result, this was an excellent match for us fans. We were finally treated to some great, legit boxing instead of all this Jake Paul publicity nonsense.
Joke,,,ok..
Well damn now we know how bad jon jones would do him
This was all the highlights of the fight. It was a few seconds and Fury looked like shit.
That result was compromised
Francis got robbed period.
def robbed that man
Biggest robbery boxing has ever seen
You all do know the Champions League is fake 🤣🤳
Fury is a champion solely based on the era he’s fighting in. Very over-rated, and Ngannou exposed him.
Bullshit
It's 2023, how can the judges be so off?
Way too many ppl in here bashing on fury acting like ngannou is some bum off the street. He’s a freak of nature, highly skilled, training for years and has been known for his power in mma. He’s not a BJJ fighter. He’s not a wrestler, amateur fighter or even some annoying YouTuber. He’s a heavy hitter recognized for power and knockouts. OF COURSE he was always gonna give fury a run in these circumstances. He’s been training in boxing, striking and all around stand up for years before getting Mike Tyson’s training. He didn’t just decide to do this 2 weeks ago. On the flip side, fury is the most unathletic dad bod looking world champion fighter in history yet ppl forget how impressive that is in itself. Besides all that, this was still exhibition, no belt or title up for grabs and not nearly as serious for fury as it was for Francis. Francis had nothing to lose and fury, trying, but not wilder fights trying, wants to put on a show. Let fury unify the belts from usyk then give me a true rematch title fight btwn Francis and Tyson to see how they really stack up
Ngannou won
Elbow to the face and knock down… ngannu won In my eyes.
When you’re the Champ and the challenger is a newcomer to the sport, you lost if it was even close.
lets be frank Francis got screwed on the score card. It makes me as a boxing fan not want to watch boxing anymore. A lot of fans had FRANCIS winning that match 62% to 35% Doesn't matter if your a better fighter then someone, if you got a bunch of British Tyson fury fan boys as judges you will lose anyways . FRANSIS WAS THE FIGHTER AND WINNER THAT DAY , THAT MATCH
So we not gone take a point off for the elbow  Robbery bruh
Yea but francis won and its beyond obvious......boxing will always be corrupt
Francis ate that elbow😯
Shit racist af yt boi couldn't even get a real knock down
Ahh bullshit
Yo, boxing fans, am i tripping? I watch a little mma, but did i just see an elbow?? Shouldn't francis's knockdown and damage count for more points? Oh he was outscored? Well shouldnt that elbow drag tysons points down? I mean come on, an elbow can KO anyone and certainly will stagger you. That alone could have rocked the stamina of francis in so many ways. I keep hearing it was a close fight, but that elbow should have been the decider of points. What the heck is this scoring?
That's BS.... This the exact same reason I don't watch boxing anymore
All these Dubai people look the same in that outfit.. LMAO can't even tell who's who 😂
Woooow y’all in these comments acting like they didn’t just CHEAT and award this man a victory when he clearly loss 😂
Rigged Francis won that shit like wtf
The old saying. Never leave it to the judges. We all know who really won.
The fact boxings most popular heavyweight champ lost to a UFC fighter, AND CORRUPT BOXING CHEATS YET AGAIN. Boxing is the most pathetic excuse for a sport there has ever been. Fury knows he lost the fight, you can see it in his face after the fight. Boxing is a joke 😂
BS
Weaka$$ fight fawkin pathetic
Once a cheater always a cheater.smh
There will be a rematch
That's what happens when you take you opponent lightly.
Bullshit
Fuckin robbed
Boring 😴
Sorry but my opinion is the fight was BS and they both got paid way more than they deserved. Glad I did not pay for it. Boxing is dead.
francis won
Francis won that fight
Weak left hook 🤣🤳
Imagine that knockout shot with MMA gloves and followed up with hammer fist.. tyson💀
If only we judged how they looked in the end
🤣🤣 Wow!  Was Francis Trolling and dancing in front of him when he knocked him down?.😯🤣  And he took thst elbow like he Actually enjoyed it. Like Yummy😋.   He must've felt right at home. (MMA)🤣👍
As someone who love’s boxing, I am a huge boxing fan Francis won this fight. Tyson was on his back foot more and was constantly clinching, I always believe that when it comes to a decision the victory should always go to the Aggressor
The fight sucked, Francis still crying as usual
Gotta do more to beat the champ.
Racism win this fight for fury because that elbow should’ve got a point taken away
Boxing is done
France N🏆 Really Won
Nobody expected that shit, good job Francis, you may not have won but you went further than anyone else would have. He scored a knockdown, made it to the end and almost beat a current boxing champ, that's pretty impressive.
I’m like a kid on the playground. “Again again”
Fury lost 😂😂😂
Run it back for the belts
It doesn’t matter about how good Francis did…the fact is Francis  simply won this fight …. The judges need to be investigated…. In fact fury even threw a whole elbow that should’ve disqualified him all together … this was some bullshit
Ngannou got hosed by the judges. I hope he gets a rematch, somewhere, down the line. He deserves one.
How?
Tyson fury is build like a drunk fat man
No other boxer walks through that elbow like Francis
This is like a real life Rocky story... if Rocky had already gained worldwide respect as a combat sport champion before fighting Apollo, lol.   In all seriousness, I love Ngannou has made a habit out of proving people wrong. No matter what the score cards said or if you agree with it, Francis shut a lot of mouths in that ring. People thought he would be a joke, the joke's on them.
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE LEAVING BOXING SO CORRUPT...
Robbery no respect at all fuck that
This fix he nock him down how he lost
The champion will never lose a title fight on an exhibition. They had to give it to Tyson fury. Nagano needs to challenge him to a title fight. I believe Nagano was robbed, but that’s how it goes when you’re in an exhibition fight.
Rigged like a mf
Fuck this rigged sport
I didn’t even see the elbow when I was watching. More Kudos to Francis! He won that fight in everyone’s eyes
Fucking cheated
Otra mafia más del boxeo q bochorno.. abajo el boxeo
Let’s be real white ppl suck at fighting 😂
Rigged fight Francis should’ve won that I’m never watching boxing ever again cuz What The Hell
Guaranteed Fury is waking up today feeling like he lost the fight
Strong arm robbery!! Wilder won first fight against fury and francis beat fury !! Be real
If this doesn’t prove the UFC fighters are levels above boxers in terms of combat then I don’t know what does
Robbery
Great fight
Wilder just entered the building
Man I don’t care what nobody say FRANCIS WON THAT FIGHT .
Lol I like how they show tyson constantly countering him the entire second half of the fight.
Fury is a cheater and his future fights should be over.
That elbow was vicious
Tyson had to get humbled
The African king beat the English king last night.
Fury can take an impressive amount of punishment
Next fight should be jake paul then hell be ready for the big leagues
That Elbow though?? Fury Still cheating.... but as long as he White he Alright 😂😂... Fury is a Bum of a paper champion 🏆👍🏾👎🏾💯😆
Coach Mike Tyson prepared him well!
The best way to castigate judges and promoters for this robbery is to have zero buys for any Tyson Fury PPV. Unless he runs it back with Francis again. And right away, don't take too long to do the rematch. Run it back in December of this year.
Imagine this was a UFC a match he would had killed him the first round 😂
Bro that left hook that knocked fury down didn't even look that good.. that just shows how freakin strong Gannou is
Dude got robbed
After the fight, we now know Franscis is the BADDEST man on the planet and Tyson Fury is back to the drawing board in the boxing and mma eyes.
Terrible decision.
I bet fury wont fight francis three times 😂😂😂
Respect to Francis , he won that
Why is it that non-boxers are promoted into making higher profile fights than real ones? Put Fury in the octagon and see if he gets the same publicity. Spoiler alert: He will not.
What's with the guy wearing a picnic blanket
If Francis knocked down the heavyweight champ so easily and he is a novice. Why would anyone pay to watch Fury vs Usyk now?
Cheating for that bum fury again ….
Everyone knows you have to knockout the champ to win… undisputedly. Cant trust the judges. 🤷🏼‍♂️ good fight!
When are you guys going to give credit to Mike Tyson for teaching his knocked down punches technique to Francis.
THEY DIDNT PUT MANY SHOTS FRANCIS LANDED. Biased
Fury face all knot 🪢 up that other guy clean lol😅
Fury doing the KSI to win 😂
Bullshit boxing…. Francis should win smh
Robed him
This split decision meant Francis won but optically speaking, if a UFC fighter beats the world’s most renown champion on his first debut boxing match, it would make Fury and the Boxing brand look weak so of course they gave it to Fury..  If Francis would have focused on knocking him out more, he would have and won.
This fight happened and I didn’t even know it dang 💀💀💀
Back ripples
My boy got robbed in plain daylight🤦🏾‍♂️
Fuck Fury he got his ass whooped!!!
Fury is one of the greatest athletes I have ever seen because he is beating guys with the absolute worst body god could have ever given someone. Wow!!
Bigges Bs on tv
If your Black you have to win twice …
Bs tyson lost that fight big time .
boxing is rigged
He will be the champ soon
That was bs fury lost that fight he was getting his ass whooped. He also was elbowing Francis in the face just fighting dirty judges gave fury that win
Francis almost beat the BEST heavyweight in his OWN sport. Tyson wouldn't last 30 seconds if it was the other way around. He is truly the People's Champion.
I was watching the UK stream. Carl Frampton was on there losing his mind saying Tyson Fury lost. I think he had it as a draw but because Round 3 was a 10-8 for Francis he gave him the win.
Has everyone forgotten that Fury didn't even train for this fight?😂
This is the reason why I don't buy paperview any more cause boxing is not what it was back in the days , lots of corruption .
Tyson fury fat boy couldn’t last 15 rounds in the 70’s, 80’s heavyweight class. No fat boys could last in those days.
Robo mas descarado
Biggest cheater in modern times . FURY THE CLOWN been cheating his whole career 🎉
Robo
Tobo
The more I watch the fight the more I just see a title stolen
Fury lost, but never leave the boxing match in the hands of the referee. Or even make it go down to points.
Good sports about it there at the end, love when athletes show good sportsmanship
And nobody talks about this cheating pice of shit! Throwing elbows in a boxing match because he got dropped.
We need our own league this shit is bogus we have the best fighters in the world
Wilder vs Francis next
im surprised ngannou did as well as he did. i thought fury was gonna toy with him. its a win for him either way
All these fan boys lmao. I get the dude hits hard but that’s legit it. He stands there no movement nothing.
England cheatin again to retain their ill placed glory. Lol story as old as time. They always been sore losers bro. Big fact
Fury is such a fuckin cheat and scumbag for that elbow hit 😡
The sport of boxing is washed up, too much favoritism and all the refs are rigged. I seen the Haney fight and the results did not add up. A lot of these fights outcomes are given not to the true champion or best fighter but to the known names. Boxing is trash now not worth the money no more. The best fighters don’t fight each other no more to maintain records and the fights rarely live up to expectations, these warriors are more like twinkle toes they take the knee when times get hard, and threaten fans instead. The time has come for Real Steele these boxers are soft. The heart of boxing heavy weights are more like heavy mistakes
Once again, the clown world of boxing embarrasses itself yet again lol
They had to pay the judges off
Francis won that fight. He got cheated. Tyson threw an elbow. Dirty. Just like Wilder dropped him 2 times and they ruled it a draw. And Tyson a racist
Usyk is going to manhandle Fury.
Tyson Fury is nothing but hype. He’s not even top 20 best heavyweights.
All about $
More power shots, a knockdown, Fury threw elbows and dove to hug him...the judges should face charges for the fix.  Fury couldn't hide the loss from his face.
Man Francis would be a freaking problem in heavyweight for the boxing community 🥶
I wonder  why Tyson Fury didn't use his magic 🪄 green boxing gloves, obviously he's not so tuff without them 😏
ngannou got robbed
Ngannou absolutely won this. Ngannou looked the same leaving the cage as he went in why fury look like he ate a truck to the face.  Boxing is rigged shit.
Love the respect that they gave each other future fighters should learn from this
Fury not breathing heavy, closed mouth at end of the fight. There's no way people thought that was an even match lol
Un ROBO gano el moreno
This was bullshit man he knocked his ass out and still lost 😢
What really killed fury is he wasnt able to lean and bully francis with weight
Wonder how many of these comments are shill accounts....
Francis was robbed
Great fight by Francis!
Absolutely mockery ..Fury defeated.
That’s how boxing works!! F/:ing steeling fights 😂🤣 that’s why  boxing for the last 10 years it really sucks
Fat Fury is the biggest cheater in the history of this sport from what I've seen. Does he even train to lose weight or just worry about how he will use his elbows and cheap shots?
That 96-93 card is criminal
Lets go GYPSY KING. Never give up. Never surrender!!!
Francis should start boxinggggg
Francis won that fight, smh
I think when it comes to the fury’s they must be paying these judges because it’s robbery’s all over
Trash. Kid was robbed
boxing boring af. 10 rounds and the 2min highlight video consist of several shots of one punch for 45 seconds...wtf
The boxers always win. Even when it looks like they lose
Robbery
Just my opinion, but Francis won that fight.
Fury had to but that elbow in the mix lol
0:05
Rigged af
Fury looked a little bit xtra fat.  I don't think he prepared seriously enough.
Fuck boxing. This just proved it’s irrelevant and it’s corrupt
Bro Got robbed
I get the feeling Fury took Ngannou lightly since Ngannou is no boxer, and probably didn't train as much as he usually does. That said, even at that, what Ngannou did was both shocking and impressive.
Riddick Bowe and all boxers from the 80' 90's would destroy todays boxers easy. Boxers today seem soft and lack skill.
What a fight!!!!
Somebody would’ve got they head chopped off if fury lost we know who really won
First Tommy Fury stole KSI's win Now this?!? October is a shit year for boxing
Where’s all the boxing fans? Mma just stole your heavyweight king at your own sport. Mma is still waiting for you cowards to bring your one dimensional skill set to real fighting
If there's a rematch... my boy Francis taking that big ass belt
Francis did a great job, great coaches but fury did still win but one of the cards was way way bias! It could've actually been a easy draw but your not going to get a draw against a champ.
Nice.
Thing is fury just knew he lost.
Man I wonder how long it took them to coordinate this absolute work. Lol. So rigged it's not funny. So fury csn fight usyk and come back for another big money fight with ngannou.
Definitely a robbery
Aaaaahhaaaa
Love how Francis seemed completely unphased by that elbow, what a beast. This was only his debut and he still performed THAT well. Baddest man on the planet.🤫
Fury sorry af, man is clearly not top level anymore no wonder he’s scared of all the real heavyweight boxers he’d get smoked by Zhang
🗣️FURY THREW THE ELBOW AS IF HE WAS A UFC FIGHTER THAT'S FOUL ‼️POINTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEDUCTED...☝️🥊👍✅CHEAT‼️CHEAT‼️ CHEAT‼️ FURY HAS NOT 🚫 EARNED MY RESPECT HE'S GOING DOWN AS THE GREATEST 💪 HEAVYWEIGHT CHEATING CHAMPION 🏆 IN HISTORY 👀🤓✅👎☝️‼️
Heavyweights of today are so trash compared to the 80’s-00’s  Fury didn’t win this fight
Fraud
Francis is taking shit on social media. Shut up and accept the loss. You lost. Enough…
Lies
These are the highlights? Lmfao. No wonder no one watches boxing anymore .
I’m not gonna lie nobody fucking with Francis with the boxing gloves on he’s eating all that shit lol
Robbed him
This is wrong.
Exactly why no one watching boxing. Biggest corruption goes down in boxing for a reason.
The elbow was accidental imo cuz fury doesn't want elbows with ngonou
I'm sorry only way to beat fury is a ko
You know it was a robbery when Vegas even thought Francis won by the end of it
An absolutely appalling decision. Shows the disgusting state of this rigged sport
they had that split decision score written down before the fight started lol
He was robbed
thats Criminal...  that Elbow!!!!
Francis won fuck that
Francis only scored a knock down not fury these refs make me think
thats why Tyson Fury will never be a great to me. always dirty tactics like that nasty elbow he gave to Francis. Fury may possess better skills as a professional boxer but there wasnt even one moment he dominated the fight. that was at least a draw.
Looked rigged
Fukn b.s
People are so used to boxing highway robberies that all they comment about the dude that got robbed. These crooks is what hurt  our sport and help rise mma. Those two judges need to be fired by today.
Fury probably won from a pure point tally standpoint.  But come on, Ngannou won from every other aspect.  Power punching, control of the ring, and  sportsmanship.
This shit is so fake…😄😁😆😆🥹😆🤣
Fury list this fight! The damage is evident without doubt, and that knockdown definitely humbled him! Just more proof these fights are rigged!
Fury definitely didn’t take Francis as serious as he should. He fought him and was looking fatigued in 10 rounds. Thats unlike fury.  Francis just became an outside star and set himself up for more big money boxing. Maybe a wilder fight. Millions in that.  Mike Tyson should be praised for cleaning Francis up in the period of time he had. Actually making his boxing better compared to his mma style.  This was awesome for fight sports.
Some big ah mfers 💀
Furry is a huge loser talk about being best boxer caint even beat a UFC fighter lol
Francis won Fair and square and proved MMA is far above and beyond combat fighting so much respect to Fury but u must admit that u lost and MMA is #1 in skill and respect. This gypsy king Best admit because if not he is only fooling himself not the majority of real MMA fans.
Cheated. N we know why😂
Rigged. How did both know who the winner was when the announcer said “still undefeated” ?🤔
Tyson couldnt hurt Francis. Idgaf I feel Ngannou got robbed
Ngannu Won ....
Bro that little dance was Francis saying if this was the octagon, you wouldve been dead
Draw
Boxing protecting it’s sport.
Francis ngannou the killer of the gypsy's king.
What round was this
Francis took this...
Robbery
People not talking about who trained him forgetting that MIKE TYSON did train him 😂😂 what do you expect
Ngannu was robbed
We need a rematch let ngannou spend more time in the gym
Francis exposed fury for me. He took all his shots and knocked him on his ass had fury so scared he straight up elbowed him. Francis won the judges just went with the boxing champ but we all saw who got the better and who had to resort to cheating when they realized how full of shit they were so much for that knockout huh fury? But your big ass sure got knocked down 😂
Anyone can fight a potatoe bag....boring fight freaking boring....nothing but a morbous show.
Fury lost gtfoh 😡
If he were smart, Jon Jones would have been taken A LOT of notes.  If Francis returns to UFC and Jones beats Stipe, there's only one fight to make.  I'm not convinced Jones can take Stipe, though.
Donna probably crying somewhere
Wow!
Fury didn't win that and the judges know it
Tbh I don’t even think fury was trying. Or he might have had a contract to where he can’t go all out. Cannot compare a performance to wilder and Francis
Francis was robbed, the WBC didn’t want to give a UFC guy (who walked away champion) the belt when Fury has a championship fight in December
Boxing is rigged and fixed. It’s not a legitimate sport. Frances won this fight.
tyson fury face tells a different story - looks like he got hammered
Bullshit!!!
Absolutely eating an elbow like it’s nothing…
If the knockdown came later in the fight Francis would’ve won the fight, but regardless what anyone says Tyson won the fight.
Wow 😮
As expected in this time of division, opinions on who won goes right down racial lines. Every comment I read from a blk athlete or celeb screamed that Francis was robbed, while anglo watchers said Fury won.
Y’all saying Fury didn’t train! Gtfoh! He did train and he got whooped! Francis was injured and trained only 3 months in a proper camp with no injury smh he’s kill fury! Bet money!!!! I got a stack!
Damn Tyson looked exceptionally out of shape I know he always looks like a guy off the couch but this time round those love handles were way bigger and he just looked slow I’ve never seen him look this slow I don’t think his work up was as serious as his former opponents just my take no hate respect to both.
To show the world, and prove to himself, that he is the best heavyweight Fury has no choice but to engage Ngannu again.  And win convincingly.
Rematch coming soon
They robbed that man smh
Francis was robbed of this victory
Francis brushed off that elbow to the face line it was nothing 😂😂 He probably reacted like that because standing elbows are legal in MMA. Suprising to see that kinda shot from a champion boxer though..
Francis should keep boxing!
Noooooo
Fight was rigged Ngannou won
The gypsy king was so out of shape my man was doing the truffle shuffle getting his belt.
i thought francis had it
Nahhh
No respect for Fury at all he's a bum and a true gypsy. He robbed that man.
Whoever the judge is that said ,96 to 93 for fury should never judge again
Idk how fury won he got beat up lol.
Worsr highlights every
Lmao not one highlight in Tyson’s favor either how tf did he win
Money was made
Boxing is kind of a joke now. UFC is obviously way closer to real fighting and definitely has the “baddest men in the world.” But now you got people like Francis and Connor going in and competing vs all time great world champs in their debuts. Pretty obvious at this point there’s more talent in UFC than boxing
If that's the highlights, Francis won.
r/boxing in shambles
PICKPOCKETS IN BOXING 🥊????? Robbery!!!!!!!!!!!!!
prime vs Prime,, Mike Tyson would have killed Fury
That was white privileged at its best mtf got drop but won this why I don’t watch that shit
It’s the reason I don’t watch boxing to this day.
Francis showed us an expose of the boxing world, and won. The boxing world couldn’t have it so they did what they always do, rig the fight in favor of their favorite champion. Francis won that night, and the world knows it.
If Francis had more hand speed I don’t think this would have been close. I’m shocked by the performance. His conditioning was more important than I thought it’d be but the fact that he fought clean with pace was all the difference
I gotta see the fight. The highlights look lke FN got robbed
0:54 is Wilde! ;)
NOTHING NEW IN BOXING 👎👎👎
Francis Robbed
Francis won 😂 how u get dropped n throw an elbow n still get the dub
Boooo ngannou should've won
It was tough to score. Very little action. Fury landed only a handful of good punches and the Francis guy would not let his hands go. It was a boring fight. Nobody’s face was swollen after because of low punch landing outputs.
Tyson just got alot of heart he wills himself to get back up and keep going even though he gets put on his ass alot. He barely won by a one point decision to a MMA guy. I hope he doesn't fight Wilder again because how much more does Tyson have left in the tank.
Rematch 😢
Bs! Francis got a knockdown and Tyson should've been deducted for that elbow
Man francis is a beast😮‍💨 if he keeps it up and can learn to box a little more he’ll have a chance at becoming champ . He really only won 3 rounds , he just had the most memorable moments of the fights . But he only landed 59 punches total compared to fury 71. He def gained hella respect tho . I hope he stays in boxing .
Noooo Tyson lost this one Francis I got mad respect for you. They missed the elbow thrown which should have been deducted in points
What a show of Boxing Competition But Francis Ngannou looked great seemed very reserved an really had so much more in the tank seemed he fought with one arm the whole match I'm sure if He would have unloaded everything he had we would be seeing a different result What a great bout
First ever boxing match and beat the undefeated boxing champion.  Francis would kill any man on a fight
Another steal shame on judges
They was never gonna give that belt up unless it was a full 10 second knock out and he wasn't getting up
I used to love boxing but it has gone to shit
Id give it to ngannou based off these highlights but im guessing we left out tysons highlights?
I could not believe hearing Lennox Lewis after the fight on live broadcast stating that Tyson was not knocked down 3rd and was just an off balancing. He said he wasn’t hurt one bit. Sounds like a whole lot of copium to me lol
lol
Them white folks at it again lying ass hacks!!
The elbow alone should have Wan Francis the fight. But mad respect. A little more technique and Francis could be a force in boxing.
Mike Tyson taught him well if he stick w this sport he’s gonna be unstoppable. And he’s gonna be crazy in the octagon
Do you really think the Saudi judges would let Tyson lose???
Tyson fury isnt the best boxer because he beat wilder a guy that doesnt know how to box. Loll smh getting this level of competition from a mma fighter just shows fury shouldnt box the top competitors loll
93/96 after you've been knocked on your ass
Boo
And they said Francis fumbled the bag 😂
Just look at Tyson's face. Tells you all you need to know.
This is what CAN happen when you train at an "all you can eat" buffet.
Fury trained 12 weeks for Francis and escaped with one questionable point from the judges! So, in my opinion Francis is the baddest because of what he pulled off in that ring. Even the commentators want to run this one back!! Lol Let's have a rematch. We'll buy the PPVs
Noooo way did Fury win!!!!! Come on! The biggest robbery in boxing history and Francis is the MMA fighter and he took the elbow to the chin and didn’t say a word!! No point taken not even a stern warning from the ref!! Wooooooowwwwww
This game is so fucking rigged
lol THATS the highlights?
Francis won
Dog shit judges that's crazy furry was walked. This is way boxing is a dead sport
Do y’all see Tyson face??? Dude was so tired he started throwing elbows wtf
dont know why people are mad at the results, theres no doubt about it that francis had some good rounds specials the 3rd round where he got the knocked down but he got out boxed. it wasnt anything crazy but tyosn throw more and landed more which at the end got him the win. francis has a good future in boxing no doubt about it. i would like to see him fight wilder, two heavy hitters that would be amazing
Fury won the boxing match. Ngannou won the fans. Boxing is not rigged here. The numbers show the truth.  Mma guys can’t seem to comprehend how the rules work in boxing or mma.  It’s all in the numbers
The look on his face after catching that hook
Knocked down and throws an elbow and still wins a fight get out of here
Boxing HELLA RIGGED Done with this fake ass sport
Massive respect to Tyson Fury for having the foresight and the heart to come through when Francis needed a real paycheck. Congrats to our African son for showing up and showing out.
Gotta take it from him, can't tie it from him
Lol every saying much respect lol Francis was eating 90% of Tyson punches haha hit him with a elbow and his face didn't even move haha. Yeah right. If Francis went straight to boxing ever heavyweight would be in trouble haha IDC what any of you squid say. Give him the same amount of years as he did in the UFC and watch him just beat the shit out of everyone he fights lol
Wow, Francis!! Incredible showing against Fury.. total respect.  Francis Ngannou can be proud. I think she shocked the Hell out of Tyson Fury. Mike Tyson did a Hell of a job coaching Francis!
I can,t believe that one of the judges had ngannu winning, I'm not a fury fan but ngannu only one 2 rounds. He did,nt throw enough punches to win, you could tell who that idiot judge wanted to win.the standards of boxing are very low these days,s. I did,nt pay for this fight and haven't, payed for a fight since they ended 15 rounds title fights, sorry but these fights are very boring nowadays,s. And some of the judges are terrible
ngannou is for real m y favorite fighter god damn that was amazing
This is what boxing has become? Pathetic...
I just think if Mr. Ngannou had even a fraction of the darkness the one and only Iron Mike Tyson had then Fury would have been KOd by the 3rd round.  What do yall think?
Wow. Great clip.. so much to see
Tyson Fury was getting worked. Even he knows he didn't win this fight😂.
fury a little out of shape
And just like the entirety of sports... Rigged 😆
Robbery.  The fix was in. Corruption. What a joke.
They didn’t even count right away
Ngannou was robbed
Those punches look painful at. This is unprecedented for Tyson fury. Tyson genuinely looks terrified
Yooo
How was that highlights? Pretty sorry. A knockdown and a couple of punches. I heard he won. Or something whathave I remember. Convincing very much!
This fight genuinely upset me lmao. Fury has had two fights since Wilder III. A scam fight with Whtye and last night’s garbage performance with Francis. Tyson Fury as heavyweight champ is bad for boxing. And now there is zero chance he fights Usyk in December.
I can't lie I expected Fury to win and possibly get a stoppage. But I always knew he wasn't who everybody hyped him out to be. He only looks good against fighters with no skill. After seeing this he has no chance in hell against Usak. Fury only beats one dimensional fighters. If Wilder was actually skilled and technical he would've known to not keep aiming for the head and go for the body. Now I see what he hasn't been taking fights against REAL boxers. He beat Wilder than all of a sudden everybody says he's the greatest of all time
ROBBERY
Bull shit
He got robbed again. Especially with that elbow. I give up in these sports. Fuckin ridiculous. I'm goin to go play disc golf
I mean he had to knock him out...he may got big hits but a slip and one knock down can win.  The longer it goes the more the ufc fighters gonna get gassed.  Either way its a tie or id have to go back and count...but the elbow should be a technical putting the ufc foghter in the new chanpion spotlight.   God knows who won..i dont
Gtfo Lol lost the fight
Imagine being butt hurt after making millions of dollars just because somone had an outside view abs doesn’t agree with you
Dana white at home rn punching the air.  Of course, after punching his wife. Lol
How the heck did Tyson win that? Wtf
Mayweather won fights while backing up the entire time. Being the aggressive fighter no longer is an automatic win since Floyd came along. More punches thrown, landed, and ability to defend and slip punches wins a fight. Fury won, hand was raised
Fury has forever been a dirty boxer
I guarantee fury don’t want to fight him again 😂
This fight convinced me that Francis could beat a lot of the top heavyweights in boxing.
Too cocky. He thought he was Floyd
If you gonna beat a world champion you better win every round   And knock him out so he doesn’t get up   The champ in any sport always gets more respect by the judges it’s always been like that, the people commenting haven’t been around the game long enough to know    If it’s a tight decision the judges always give the champ the w or a Tie   U gotta really destroy a champ to be a champ let’s be real
Only way Francis would’ve been allowed to win is by KO/TKO
Anybody seen Dana white? He’s probably punching the air or his wife.
One question. Why was this fight held in Saudi Arabia?
Fuck the win Francis went toe to toe with a world class Champion and actually did good, Francis a beast
Now y’all see how wilder felt in the first fight🤣🤣🤣🤣
What a joke. Francis won this fight and everyone knows it. Tyson Fury is over rated. An MMA fighter with no professional boxing matches beat, in reality, the world boxing champion. Of course, the judges were not going to allow this. But the split decision sham won't change reality.
That elbow was on purpose and dirty AF, he definitely hit Deontae with a metal object in his glove
IF THEY GAVE IT TO FRANCIS SOMEBODY WOULD LOST MONEY
I wonder what did the Arabs say to him after the score???
MMA fighters are a different breed
Tyson lost
He should stay in boxing.looks good.
That illegal elbow by fury should have cost him a point
Only reason Tyson won because Judges can’t handle an mma fighters beating a boxer at his own game especially the “champ”, we all know Francis won lmao, poor judging.
He got robbed
U can throw elbows now ? The ref nor judges saw it 👀..
5 rounds to both, with Ngannou having a 10 - 8.  Ngannou wins the title by a point here.
Fury has been amazing in the past. But he didnt take this serious( dont know whyhe didnt  francis is a totaal killer) i know hes not a body beautiful type of fighter like fedor but he came into this fight looking like a complete shithouse with skinny arms and a post pregnant body. Pride and arrogance i think beat him. Plus francis undeniabke will and heart. If i were tyson id give francis another one and train like he did for wilder 2 and 3. I couldnt sleep right after this if i were in tysons shoes.
Fury did not take this fight seriously
Ya boy was robbed anytime a fighter gets knocked to the mat he shouldn’t win the fight
Boxing in bull. Clear win by Ngannou. Tyson even deliberately tried to throw elbows. And why is he the ONLY MAN in boxing who gloves flop around at the fingertips. They cheating fir this man. I’m done with boxing
Honestly outside of a few good punch combinations by Fury I thought Francis should have won that fight But all in all, it was still a good fight..
Exhibition matches = Rigged
Francis have Joes background
You can tell Ngannous punches really sting!! They don’t even look powerful but holy shit Tysons face was pretty bruised up.
We just witnessed a robbery. Call the cops !
Fury always doing some dirty sht always
"Tyson fury!!!, king of the jiggles!!!!"
I dont like boxing anymore, this the second time in two months this has happened. Both with the Fury Brothers smdh
Boxing fans want DEONTAY WILDER VS NGANNOU 💯
This was like Rocky
The ref never started counting
W Francis
bro he lost what ya seen? and ya aint take a point off for that elbow ya cheated
Ahora,no voy a negar que Nagonnou con un poco más de técnicas no hay un peso pesado en el boxeo que le ganará con el poder que tiene el en las 2 manos y apostaría lo que no tuviera a Nagonnou contra cualquier peso pesado
Tyson is crazy.  The more you beat up on him the stronger he gets.  Never seen anyone like him before.  Most fights he starts off looking washed then ends up a superhero.
Everybody was saying Fury is one of the best. Ali, Tyson, Foreman, Frazier, Holyfield. Would've ran circles around this MMA fighter. Fury has no discipline he got too comfortable with them Wilder paychecks. I doubt he even trained.
Well done Tyson.
We know who the real winner is
I gave Fury 6 rds to Ngannou’s 4 rds. With Ngannou registering a knockdown I felt this should have been a draw. Fury did not look himself (no head movement). Looked like he wanted the bravado and tried too much on getting a KO rather than letting the KO open up naturally
Robbery
Tyson is big and that’s his advantage. However, he’s sloppy and not a great fighter. He’s like a sideshow act….
Señores no sean marionetas y no repitan la misma estupidez que otros brutos dicen,,,,por un nockdown tu no ganas una pelea y hay que ser realistas ,si es verdad que Nagonnou lo tiró en el 3 round pero los otros 9 round Fury le dió un baile y quién gana una pelea por qué GANASTES un round???? Son unos Marionetas jajajaja
Technically fury.
Yeah thats bullshit lmao, francis won bullshit ass judges
Y’all believe that Knock down? Tyson fury had to do something to not receive backlash from a win everyone expected.
Francis got robbed he knocked him down and did everything to show Tyson is not the best give Francis a year of boxing training and he would would wipe the floor with any heavyweight.
Francis is favored by god, Mike saw that and that’s why he trained him. Everybody doubted his decisions to leave the UFC. He got paid more than anyone in the ufc taking this fight. People thought he would get destroyed by Tyson. He’s the first ufc fighter to knockout a world heavyweight champion and go the distance. You can’t tell me shit.
I find it weird people are surprised how well Francis Nga did. He literally used be a boxer before he transitioned to mma.
Francis won that fight... Boxing has been rigged since it started..
They always gotta give the white hype the win
He was robbed by tyson fury
Huge L for boxing. Can we just get a real sport thats not rigged
The real winner is the one respected by everyone after
ROBBED
7-3 Fury for all you casuals
Split decisions suck
What fight were the judges watching?
WOW, what a display of boredom. People actually  go pay to see that?
Fury is no longer in contention for greatest heavyweight. They only gave the win to him to not upset the people who fund pro boxing.
Now let’s do mma next
Ever time they cheat to distory our people who win and everyone can see fuck racism black lives matters
Francis deserve respect
Highlights??? ESPN SUCKS with their fight highlights , just say it was the knock down
Wtf... Tyson LOST SO OBVIOUSLY! AND THIS IS WHY I DON'T GIVE A SHYT ABOUT FAUX BOXING. IT'S ALL BS AND BRIBED AMD FIXED. JUDGE'S SHOULD BE ASHAMED AND KARMA COMES RIGHT BACK AROUND. THIS IS WHY I DON'T WANT MMA FIGHTER'S IN BOXING. THEY'LL NEVER GET THE RESPECT THEY DESERVE. THANK YOU TO MIKE TYSON FOR TRAINING NGANNOU. CONGRATS CHAMP, THE WORLD KNOWS YOU'RE THE FACTUAL WINNER OF THIS FIGHT. FURY LOOKED LIKE JELLO WRAPPED SAUSAGE DANCING AROUND THE RING. DESPICABLE!!!
I appreciate that he actually looks like a boxer in the ring.
Real life Rocky movie.
Just wanted to comment on the love and respect shown here. Damn I been hanging around F1 fans too long 😂
Francis won
How.. Francis actually knocked him down, plus Fury used and elbow to the face. Fury literally cheats
What???
Then I do my lil dance 😅...Francis
With what I j watched Francis should have easily won
Boxing is dead and this proves it.
If there was going to be a winner it should be  Francis ngannou but at least make it a draw but I know why they make Tyson fury the winner because they want to save the heavy weight face of boxing and also the sports it’s self so doing that wouldn’t been such an embarrassment to the boxing federation. It’s still is regardless of what there decision is for it to even been this close in the score card says a lot.
Lmao you throw an elbow on a mma fighter that’s nothing
Fury gets knocked down but he gets up again your never gonna keep him down 😅.  Big up to both of these warriors for being great sportsman.
Was MBS there?
En lo tiempo de Mike Tyson no le dura ba dis rounds
that messed up he didn't win this fight come on now, tells how much did you pay the judges🖕🖕🖕
57 years old Mike Tyson can destroy Fury in 5 seconds.
Those two guys in red at the end said. "Dont worry" "we will pay you much more"
Fixed fights are embarrassing
Why are all theses fights happening in Saudi Arabia🤷 good fight tho
Fury tossing elbows now?! What a cheater
They couldn't let him win all a set up HORRIBLE
Tyson should have lost
Bullshit
FRANCIS WON ! this man exposed Fury ! 👏👏👏👏
Seems fixed.  I love Francis but cmon now
85% of comments reactions on judge untrue results.
That was bullshit wtf
Francis could box 🙌💯Dirty..smh
Boxing is bullshit. Francis won.
So I guess Fury's face doesn't tell the story?!?!
What an embarrassment. Liken to when Fraud Mayweather struggled with another guy who had never boxed before.
Aaand STILL!!!
The only way he could get that belt is by KO
Thunderlips pushed Rocky all over the ring back in the day  , this isnt really all that suprising to me .
Tyson Fury you loss and you know it
This is a day light robbery ohh my God
He dropped fury in early round! Fury threw a elbow not point taking away! Didnt do anything to show he was turning the fight around! Pure robbery Smh You gotta fight like TANK knock every fighter out
Boxing is corrupt
This should stop.. the results that could be seen by everyone, it clear but hear the score card.😮 I am a big fan of both Tyson = Francis won it.🎉 watch again the fight.
ROBBERY THE KNOCK DOWN WON!
Francis won! Period!
Fury is garbage
Fury the great white hype
I knew they would cheat for this devil.   They cheated Wilder and now they cheated this brotha.
Francis won that, Tyson Fury sucks and needed corrupt judges and elbows.
Fury took this fight off.
Nice fight Francis
Respect to Francis, but we all know this guy can't last 12 rounds.
WE WANT NGANNOU VS USYK
Boxing is being exposed.
Rigged
None of these guys would have stood a CHANCE against the boxers of old...
That’s what you call Robbery decision.
I think Francis should go pro as a boxer n leave mma . He did amazing and im not just talkin about the knockdown he actually boxed a good ass fight Vs a  legend who’s undefeated he would be a problem in the HW division I don’t see him losing to anybody but big baby usyk and possibly wilder if he gets caught
Rigged result?
I think Francis won, they can't hurt the credibility of Tyson fury like that. Because if he gets beat by an ameture, then his whole previous record kind of becomes a joke
Real props to MIKE TYSON for training Ngannou that mans first boxing match was great
Why did yall show that shit and call it highlights ?
Ppl in the comments really believing this was real🤣🤣... These were two business men taking advantage of an opportunity to make some big money! This entire fight was staged, the punches were pulled and set up! they was never going to let Fury lose! It's WWE with boxing.
When is a boxer going to mma?
This is like almost the set up to Rocky, bet they have a rematch and Francis becomes champ 😅
They worked him
Fury elbow was wild
Elbows and judges
Bullsheeeet. Im disgusted
That elbow shot should've  gave Francis the win
Ngannou won, period.  Completely rigged result.
Wtf were these highlights 🤣
More proof boxing is rigged
These fights are rigged fury should of lost  that's why a lot of people don't want to pay for fights  like this  I didnt waste my money on BS
Fuk the judges. We know who really won. 😂
Dana White is somewhere PISSED
You gotta knock the champ out...end of discussion.
Respect this respect that! Fury was the better man! That’s all to it
WHO WAS THE JUDGE THAT SAID 96-93 FOR FURY?????? WAS JOHN FURY A JUDGE???😂😂
Francis will be a boxing champ if he wants
That's the most damage I've seen fury take....and francis looks fresh
That elbow was supposed to be a point deduction. Boxing need to cleanse all the judges. 😂🤣
Robbery
Blacks losing left right and center by my white brother Fury.
Who the heck would have Tyson winning this…. Total robbery and I’m not one to normally say that…. Had this been the UFC or a real fight, Francis would’ve swarmed him on that knockdown and it would’ve been a stoppage by the referee (or death in a real fight)… the fact that the judges didn’t honor this shows that boxing rules don’t respect the martial side of martial arts.
I would say from the highlights he lost
Dam😂
That's bitch cheats again... Imagine that!!
Vages made that decision 😅😅😅
Wow these highlights are pretty bias.
That’s gotta be the best performance by an mma fighter coming over to boxing so far.
Who’s face was more beat up? That’s your loser.
Ngannou vs Joshua, make that fight now. Capture the moment and let Ngannou become a pro boxer and get the bag.
Can Francis fight Jake Paul next. 😂😂😂
I think Fury was even surprised he won
Wtf
you know waht's just as impressive that isn't being talked about? is how fast Mike Tyson had NGannou ready for this fight...Mike Tyson might be a really good trainer!!!
Big Bang Zhang would KO Fury
Boxing definitely protecting their boy. We all know what this was.
That check hook knock down was just amazing to see. Can't believe I missed this fight
Francis won that fight
Got robbed. This exactly why nobody likes boxing anymore because its so corrupt.
Great White Hype.. out of shape goofy white man beat a well built in shape black. Rematch in Vegas anyone! Boxing so fake😂😂😂
Fuck Tyson Fury and that fight. Francis got robbed.  -Tyson Fury Fanboy
Didn’t know it was a Muay Thai match🤣
Robbery!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What a bullshit call Francis won that no doubt what a shit corrupt sport
Fury fights are rigged.
Ngannou Can Win This Fight, Needs More Speed & It’s Over, Fury Goes Down. But Unfortunately, Moneys Involved So, Who Can Tell If These Fights Are Even Real
Boy better hang those gloves up and relax before he messes that record up
That MuthaF#€%er know he lost that fight. He had defeat all over his face with his cheating A$$.
Francis won this fight.
Go 8 rounds next time
Francis won the fight
Us blacks can’t win in America 🇺🇸
Lol they stole that fight lmao my boy got beat bad never go out the country to fight they are scam artist
This fight was like a real life Rocky movie. Both fighters did great.
Bullshit
Boxing judges saved their reputation by stealing from ngannou his win, they're so corrupted
Fight was not called fairly tyson was doing some dirty boxing without penalty and even looked like he knew he didn't win before they called it.
Minus point for elbow 😢
Francis won!!!!
Bull shit
Why I no longer watch boxing. The winner of the fight according to the eye is seldom the winner anymore unless it's a Ko
Tyson knew at the moment he fucked up
All the RESPECT to FRANCIS!   WENT THE DISTANCE WITH THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WORLD AND EARNED MAD RESPECT   FRANCIS IS GOING TO BE UNSTOPPABLE IN MMA!  Run it again!
Bs
Whattt
This shit was bullshit....fury jnown for cheating throein rlbows an shit 😂😂😂😂😂
Robbery
Pure heart
Gun won that dight
The great black hope failed.
Robbery
Da man beat fury. Boxing is rigged🤔
Bull sht
How is a mma fighter fighting for a heavyweight champion belt when you got guys who train their whole life in boxing to have this fight
Flash knockdown.  Fury got up fast, survived and jabbed his way to a very very close win.  You must take the belt away from a champion if this caliber and leave no doubt.  TOO MUCH MONEY involved in boxing.
Look at greasy Bob Arum(old guy standing next to Ngannou at the end), making sure to stay close by. Hes a money sucking leach promoter in boxing(the biggest). Wants his paws on Ngannou.
What Dana white gotta say about this shoutout Francis some bs
They robbed him bruh.. Got hit with a elbow and he was knocked down… I like Fury but they robbed buddy
After this fight i doubt Francis will go back to the UFC. If continues training as a boxer he will be a heavyweight contender for sure
Hes not bad
Francis knew unless he knocked him out with a ten count he wouldn't win.
I already knew this man would knock him the fuck down with his power
*To Be Fair:* Ngannou wasn't "robbed." It's more like he got _'gypped'_ by the judges... Afterwards he went to the hotel and stole all their bikes    Then sold them to Gypsy King.
Another bad judged Fury win, first that shit KSI fight when he literally was controlling the fight the whole time. To this Francis totally looking like the better fighter and didn’t win, it’s bs
Tyson fury don't want a rematch i bet. Come to the octagon now. Francis couldn't beat that ass the way he knows how in a boxing ring
I’m very disappointed fury you looked so scared 🤦🏽‍♂️ congrats Francis on beating the heavyweight champ in your first boxing fight crazy.
Tyson fury is a fat joke and so is the heavyweight division
That knocked down was weak lol he lost balance that’s it
SO GLAD for this outcome!  Francis is a BEAST!!!  I am SO sick of idiots going on and on about the "sweet science" of boxing and how Boxers will always win against an MMA fighter who magically has drastically different biomechanics when punching because...***something dumb***...  Its SO stupid.  This isn't Volley Ball vs Football, if ANYTHING Boxing takes LESS SKILL because there's MORE limits and areas you have to be skilled at.  I'm fine with Boxing (I've done it) and I'm fine with MMA (done it).  They are different but I'm old enough to remember how James Toney was going to kick Randy Couture's ass because of the "sweet science" and different timing and...whatever other dumb shit people said...look at what happend...
Announcers even knew you had it.  General consensus was that you won... and some judge has a 96-93 for Tyson? He couldn't have been watching the same fight I was... or the numbers are just entirely made up... Y'all notice ever since WWE + UFC combined, every event has been like this? We should all stop watching until they stop rigging.
Boxing politics at it finest 😂🤡
I really hate when a fight is somewhat close, casual fans start coming out and yelling “robbery”. You wanna see a real robbery go back and watch Pacquaio vs Horn. The Gypsy King won the fight. On top of that, Ngannou had boxing experience and was the UFC heavyweight champion so people making him out to be some Rocky character that got screwed are stupid.
Whats that Suadi prince POS doing there? Thats a slaver, for all you who hate slavery.
That elbow landed clean. Francis took it like a Champ. Tyson was desperate. He lost the mental edge and had to resort to dirty tricks. Shameful.
THE FIX WAS IN
Fury is gonna get cooked by osyk dec23
Just stop already.. why support a corrupt product ESPN.. unless you are all corrupt like Saudi Arabia?
Imagine if Ngannou worked on his cardio and had some tune up fights before this, Fury would be power napping.
How did tyson win? I didnt see fransis hit thae mat once let alone flinch… and he took an elbow to the head an kept walking forward tf is this?
What a robbery
No disrespect to Francis. I think he won. Fury, as Heavyweight champion? performed shamefully. As Usyk said , it looked like he was not serious. Might he have been sandbagging? Whatever the case is , If he gets in the ring with Usyk , he will get a boxing lesson imo.
Straight up bullshit
Judges were wrong
Tyson all cok3ed out in horrible shape look at that belly !
I never really watch Tyson fury fight but I don’t see him knocking the prime mike Tyson 😂
He lost for real that’s crazy
Fury is a joke
The African was robbed it’s clear and plain to see
Tbh fury looked a lot more fat this time
WTF Ngannou won.  Judges again rigged the match for fury.  I am now convinced that all sports are rigged from football, boxing, etc.
Ngannou is the people's champ
Wtf is this short ass highlight tape
This was a close match it was no robbery either way. I will say the rounds Francis won he won more convincingly than the rounds Tyson won but that’s not how fights are scored. I think people forget this and that’s why they’re calling it a robbery.   Big elements were Francis size and strength. A big part of Fury’s game is leaning on smaller fighters and getting them tired. That wasn’t happening with Francis because Francis is barely lower in weight than fury but Francis is solid muscle where as Tyson has some flab so Francis is obviously stronger.   Francis can also take punches more than recent heavyweights Fury has fought attributed to his neck size and weight.   Another element is that Fury was expected to tko/ok Francis and Francis used this to his advantage because it allowed him to be the counterpuncher. Many times in high level combat the counter puncher has the advantage, especially if they have power.   I think Fury got knockout happy with his last few wins and thought he could do the same with Francis. If you watch the Fury and Klitschko fight, you’ll see what Fury has to do to beat big fighters, it’s not pretty. I reckon if they rematch, that’s the approach the team will have and Fury will have an easier night.   In the end Francis stock went up where Tyson’s went down so in that aspect, Francis won.
If francis pushed just a little more between 4-7 he would have straight knocked him out
If anyone thinks Tyson Fury is a real boxer, you're out of your mind. That blob is a joke.
Robbed
Francis did Wayyyyy better than McGregor
Francis is humble, respectful, and the real winner.
So,was it an exhibition sissy fight or an actual boxing fight because, to me, it looked like punches were being pulled
Another reason boxing isn't a legitimate sport
Who expected an African to beat their Great White Hope. They don't even have the balls to try. Just pay them and they will give you a show on how to crumble. Only a BLACK American will have the dignity to win. Just by him showing off his flag tell it all for me.
Francis shocked the world. I now 100% respect his boxing skills. He went the limit & put down 1 of the greatest. Cant wait to see him fight again
Every knows Francis won the sport is so corrupt. Even Tysons knows he got beat.
Francis all day fucking robbery
Fury 👎
How????
Wait did Tyson knock down Francis plus no point taking away for the crazy elbow I’m lost did I miss somthing
That was embarrassing... Fury fat out of shape... Didn't train....
wow Francis is such an amazing individual.... seriously. this guy is special. I have a feeling fury took him way too lightly though and will make a statement in the rematch..but holy crap.... for Francis to seriously test the champion in another sport like this is just amazing.  Dana white should have paid this man more.
No ped use by francis
I didn't watch the fight, and I'm glad.  It looked like a boring fight.
Highway robbery
The Judge that scored 96-93 Fury needs to be looked into closely.  That seems beyond plain incompetence.
Tyson theory best in the sport what the hell are you smoking
Bad call… typical
Bro that elbow was pretty ridiculous i cant believe fury won this after being knocked down and fighting plain dirty against someone thats not even competing in their sport
I want to see Francis vs wilder now lol.
Back to the drawing board,next time dont get a dopehead to train you.
Ngannou is set to pocket approximately $10 million for his first professional boxing fight…. Im happy for him, I still want him to see him fight Bones Jones for UFC heavyweight strap someday
The future looks bright for Francis
Boxing couldn’t afford to let Tyson Fury lose this fight and gifted the win.  For us, if there were any questions about Tyson Fury being in the convo for baddest man on the planet, those have clearly been answered.   You can’t get to fight John Jones in the octagon if you wouldn’t beat Francis there 😂
I WANT WHAT THAT JUAN GUY WAS SMOKING
FRANCIS GOT ROBBED!  HELL WITH ALL THAT HIS 1ST FIGHT WAS GOOD! HE FN WON! TYSON FURY IS TRASH!
Boxing is a JOKE
Good job losing francis
That’s some BS
Straight set up… fury did not deserve that win what a waste of money..
Robbery
Fury wasn’t expecting the power behind that hook 😂
Much love to both fighters ! Making Fighting Great Again
First boxing match is against a LEGEND and he MANAGES A KNOCK DOWN? Hugeeeee respect🤝
As I always said! Tyson fury is a world class cheater! And always has been! And always will! There’s evidence! Only his fan boys refuse to see the light since they are pleased seeing him win at any cost! Fury has used dirty tactics and even cut part of his glove in a fight back when! And as we all know and seen, he also used the lose glove tactics to slip in & out of them to hit his opponent with pure knuckles! Also using his jab he will hit his opponent with the bottom of his palm✋ on the nose! Tyson Fury is & always will b a cheater!
Bruh see francis just needed some more time with mike and he would've knocked tyson fury out
As a Fury fan Francis did really good and deserved a rematch. This fight is very closed but I think the knockdown would have make Fury lose the decision. A rematch is needed but let us see the Usyk vs Fury first and Wilder vs Francis would be nice match up too.
You can see it in Fury face he knew he really loss
WOWWWWW SPLIT DECISION MY ASS FRANCIS SHOULD HAVE KNOCKED THAT TALL BLOCK HEAD FURY OUT
The white boy clearly lost the day fight...Boxing is officially not a must see sport anymore ..its reminds ne of WWE
That elbow should disqualify him
And everyone say Jones didn’t run from this man. John jones a bitch
ESTos pedejos del box ya es puro negosio  ponen a perdedores por ganadores ya es basuras El box bendidos
Fixed
Far from a highlight
Fury didn't even believe he won
Francis, stay away from mike tyson! He is a rapist!
That was robbery without a gun !
Wtf I did watch this but Fury actually got knocked down!!????
Acting
Francis won
That elbow should've lost Fury the match  WTF is that  If Fury wanted an MMA match he would've fucking flopped over
Ngannou looked quite good against Fury. I honestly thought it was going to be more like Mayweather v McGregor. Astoundingly good performance from Ngannou. Respect. Id like to see Ngannou v Wilder now.
They robbed Francis mane
The elbow showed lack of class. Fury lost respect from that.
So boxing still corrupt. K ill continue to not watch
I’m white on this fight black man won 🏆 😂
Rigggedddd there u have it
Looks like a tough man fight from the 90s...
BS
I see what y’all did there y’all cut the highlights to make it look like Tyson was kinda winning y’all always do that for y’all golden boys I just watched a 7 minute long highlight yall probably took it down by now because y’all didn’t want nobody to see it
And just like that, Francis let everyone know that Dana. Is full of sht and should have paid the man.
I feel like it'd of been a completely different fight say if they were actually competing in a real professional fight that counts. If Fury's belt was pn the line it'd of been completely different fight. Still gotta give Ngannou credit. He showed up for sure.
Francis would destroy AJ and Wilder
Francis got cheated out of this one
FURY GIVEN AN UNDESERVED GIFT DECISION...EVERYONE SAW NGANNOU DOMINATE.
Michael buffer just give no excitement when he’s the in ring announcer
If he wasn't a UFC fighter that elbow would've counted against fury.
They should make a movie about Ngannou’s life. He’s amazing
Bro call it how it is francis won boxing is rigged. This is why boxing is trash
I don't care how bad that you beat them in that ring,  every Black American fighter knows that you got to knock a european fighter out to win
Boxing have a new problem to deal with  France Ngannou , he should start fighting in Boxing now
Francis has won the respect of everybody and won what he wanted....a money of 40fights together of UFC
Francis got robbed! The promoters and judges could never let an outsider win belts in their first match.
😢😢😢😢😮
Not impressed with Fury at all. Boxing is a joke.
Shame on those judges. They are corrupt and lack moral integrity.
Hard to take fury seriously or this fight when you look like you just got of the couch after a 2 year cheez doodle and beer binge!
Damn fury looked horrible. He needs to take this sport serious. He’s honestly holding those titles hostage. How does he go from moving and jabbing like a smaller fighter to moving and hitting super sluggish and slow, dudes doing it for money
😂😂😂that's some bullshit I'm glad I didn't watch that s***
It’s a shame fury got to throw elbows and cheat to win against a novice boxer
You're telling me a non boxer knocked down the champion and didn't score a wine after also getting illegally elbowed
Boxing is dead!!!
Idk I like Tyson fury but that hit with the elbow should have dropped his score quite a bit
Fury lost
Francis ngannou HAS ARRIVED!
Obviously 2 judges were paid to see a different fight .
Entering for this sport history as the most unfair judges decision. Something was wrong there, with the scores counting. Dirty business
francis won easy.
Robbed that black man in front of the World 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️they say All sports are “Allegedly Rigged”
I like Tyson Fury but the judge needs to stop with the b/s Francis was robbed
Everybody knows Fury won the game of Boxing Politics / and NOT the BOXING Match…
Fury looks out of shape
Did we watch the same fight
Tyson won on points. I get that it looked bad but go watch it again. Yes Tyson got humbled but he threw more and landed more. Tyson did not get beat up, he got dropped once just like he has before and embarrassed. All this emotional bullshit right after the fight is just that. It was actually a pretty boring match. Compare that fight to the Riddick Bowe v Holyfield wars or the Ward v Gotti wars back in the day?? You can't. Tyson has purged his demons. Once a champ starts talking about being a Dad and a brother and a Son with cry baby piano music in the background and playing belly tickle at the weigh in he's finished. Francis will destroy him in a rematch. Not to mention, Tyson has been fed this old school line by his trainers that resistance training makes a fighter slow and cumbersome. Yeah if that's all you do it might but in a modern paradigm it's an absolute necessity. That argument has been put to bed long ago. Tyson looked like a bag of shit going into that fight. There is NO WAY you can train to your maximum potential and still look like that...even without lifting a single dumbbell. He's just used to having a big size/reach advantage. He and his family are too stubborn to change. It's time for him to retire.
If Francis ever sells the rights to a movie about himself, i hope a black filmmaker like Ryan Coogler directs it.
Wow Ngannou has a brick face no marks not even when fury the cheater hit him whit the elbow
Francis was robbed
Boxing is dying because the sport is even more obviously rigged than WWE
Bruh that left hook wasnt even hard 🤣
96-93?????? What fight was he watching???
I don't think Fury has ever looked so damaged in a fight not with Wilder not with anybody of course boxing is so corrupt and so much of a business end......of course they let gypsy king won, I'm just glad Ngannou knocked him out in the 2nd
👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
This proves that boxing it rigged. And has been for a very long time. Boxing is a dying sport has been for a long time, they can’t let their undefeated champion lose to a first time boxer
Ngannou won that fight. I like Fury as well, but come on.
Robbery
Fury planned to go in there and just run over Francis. Then, he got dropped. Like Mike says: Everyone has a plan until you get hit.
The announcement for who won the belt was so lame. Guy sounded asleep on the mic. UFC is so much better.
Full of shit
We needa rematch! Ngannou won that
If it was MMA, the fight would have been over once Fury hit the  canvas because Francis would have been able to keep punching until the referee stop the fight. I'm willing to bet Fury's purse for this fight that he will NEVER fight Francis Nagnou in a cage/UFC. Fury, that UFC elbow was dirty.😂
Cheaters never Win, Winners never Cheat! Congratulations Ngannou.
embarrassing for furry, phat phuck
Francis won this is bs
Ngannou stood strong
Francis Got Robbed
Cheating ass always throwing forearms and elbows and gets away with it
So many dumb fucks out here. Imagine thinking frances won. Bunch of apes
Fury lost this fight. Luckily I bet 5 dollars on this fight, for Tyson Fury, and I won 👍🏿
I personally this Francis won
El marrano del box siempre ha sido así de sucio el fury
Boxing is a joke.  Francis deserved the win.  Just glad he got his bag.  Now he can come back to MMA where he’ll be properly scored.
Exact reason why I don’t watch Boxing & instead prefer UFC Tyson was holding the whole dam night Francis broke him down. Francis Won Boxing is Rigged !!!!
They robbed him just because ngannou is a face in the ring
This decision is a prime example of “I’m white, and I say so”
Amazing
He scored the only knocked down and lost smfh lol
😂😂😂😂 fury 🫵🏾🫵🏾🫵🏾🫵🏾
Robbery
I didn't watch the fight so I have several questions, did Fury knock Ngannou down and were any points taking away with that clear elbow to the face of Ngannou by Fury?
That’s bs!!!
96-93 Fury is wild😂
He lost
They out robbing people and shi wtf
I was wrong about fury!! He's trash 🗑️
Barely ‼️ boy you better retire
Man people should be lining up to go train with Tyson
Fury was a nobody before the Wilder fight.. and still is a nobody he can easily be beat but you know it's satan's world so all the popularity comes from rituals the rich use to stay up and in power if you don't sacrifice and perform rituals you won't get THAT famous if you do you get shut up aka suicide😂
There was more fucking highlights than that
Francis vs Jake Paul next
Fury looked horrible
ha FN was cheated oh no rematch please
He was robbed in this fight. Tyson Fury took him for granted and had to be saved by the judge’s scorecards. No way 3 judges watched 3 different fights
Great Job Francis. You Are Gleaning.
How Fury got the decision is beyond me. Fury destroyed his reputation how embarrassing.
The judges are no good
That’s the I should have trained a lot harder look
Bro wasn't even guarding his face. Bro really underestimated him
Naw definitely fixed and this dude hit with Elbo Tyson fury trash  and so are the Judges
Cheating! How the heck furry won this match  .no way
Racist decision he dropped that cracca you won now they cheating blaccs to make whites and others win when we win literally
I think Tyson fury did win just because he was landing a lil more in the late rounds but much respect to Francis. He is tuff as nails. He doesn’t even look like he was in a fight even though he went against arguably the greatest heavyweight of all time. Tyson fury not only got dropped but his face is beat up
A split decisión damages Fury’s legacy. I don’t know if he took his opponent seriously or not, but either way, Fury is going to have to give Francis a rematch and show this was a fluke.
Gypsy king baby
Robbery
How can a professional boxer be a champion with a dad bod??? Blows my mind! Fury looks overweight…
Champs gotta be knocked out, especially undefeated champs.
How did Tyson furry win this match...Francis seems to punch and hit points  better than furry
Heavy weight Division is a complete Joke!
That elbo looked intentional. Francious ate it and didn't blink. Francious is a beast
Funny how no one is speaking on that clearly shown elbow Fury threw. He knew he was in trouble and tried to take the easy way out.
If wrestling is scripted then so is boxing the judges might as well be called creative writers
Tyson fury throwing elbows and illegal punches. The fix is in.
Usyk is about to eat. If Fury even has the guts.
Everyone knew Francis was gonna lose. The pressure was on Tyson Fury to not let all that go to his head and he didn’t. If Francis won, it was an upset, if Fury won it was just another day. Great job by Francis, and great job by Fury to not underprepare or underestimate too much given all the buzz.
What a Sham of a so-called Boxing match
Damn Fury's face when he got knocked down says it all. If that was a right he might have been done.
How you lose when you knocked the opponent down
Naganyu should of won, and Tyson fury cheated, again.  Lost all respect for fury here
More rigged boxing.
Robbery
Francis won
U definitely have to respect Francis nagannou he truly give fury a hell of a fight and for being his first boxing match he did amazing now they should have a rematch but UFC style
Lmao i felt these abu dabi fights have sucked lol last weekend ufc shit show this weekend boxing
Fury conditioning was a total mess, what a joke. Very sloppy. People paid to see this…….
fury won but its cool to talk shih bout the judges. the saudi's payed them good fashih show. i just caught that elbow haha fury hell
THIS IS WHY BOXING IS DEAD RIGGED AS FUCK
Yea another slow ass count from the ref😒
Robbery !!!
What?! That’s dumb
Francis was robbed. It was nowhere near even he clearly kept the belt because he can’t just come into a sport beat the champ and take the belt. Tyson Fury is as horrible a champ as Wilder. One has no technical training the other is constantly out of shape. Francis was the clear winner here!
Francis ufc career made him eat that elbow😂😂😂like it was lunch
Knock down, elbow , and they still gave it too the lad lad lol cheers ...francis kicked his ass streets know
Im damn proud of Francis
Ngannou should go to boxing immediately! He demonstrate hugh level
Fury was beaten period. He looked old, out of shape, unprepared, shocked and desperate with that intentional elbow. He was knocked down early in the 3rd, when he was able to fight with 87% of the best that he had, and he got knocked down. Yet he retained his championship? A judge scored the fight 96 to 93? 👌
Nganou lookin pretty ENHANCED in this one.
Francis fought so well…and he would absolutely maul Tyson in a cage after seeing that…great fight but I think it should’ve been a draw
The whole family is just robbers bro
And all fury could say was it was behind the head trying to make excuses but that hit was flush right to the side of his dome knocked his ass down fair and square!💪🏾👌🏾
This is a show not a fight no big deal glad it happened 👍 also F SA
Nganmou respect to you
How did Tyson win thou
Francis got robbed shxt is definitely payed off
This is a quetescetial example of racism. There's so much money invovled and the caucazoid powers that be will not let the white trash king lose to a migrant dirt worker. They wouldn't with Wilder (Glove) and especially NGANNOU (Elbow). The cheating!!!!! Gypsys are known to grift ya and they got ya again. Are you not entertained at the expense of white supremacy? silence is compliance
Wow Francis actually beat his ass. 😮 That's wild. He looked way better in there than Fury but of course he somehow loses. Fkn fake sport.
What fight were the judges watching? Maybe someone knocked them in the head before the fight? OR the mob told them how to vote?
Fury is a dirty ass fighter
You know damn well that was rigged Francis dropped him
How fury win tho 😂😂😂 rigged sports
Bullshit
Francis is amazing, and will soon be champ> I like Tyson how respectful he is. Both men are true warriors.
If I had any power I would create online page where the whole world can vote who truly won the fight the judges are full out not hiding they rigged
Bro got robbed 😤
Fury did not win guys he sells tickets
Francis vs Tyson in MMA, wonder how that would play out? I would love to see some of these boxers step into a MMA cage once in a while lol.
Cheaters never win? Well the judges cheated.
That card was miserable to watch
He rocked Fury again in the 8th
Most of the judges were blind!
Tyson was the planned winner guys cmon justa payday with the agreement tyson wins
Fury got the shit beat out of him. They should of said new champion.
These are some trash ass highlights 😂
How do you score the only knock down and still lose? And also eat an elbow with no point loss by opponent..rigged..now way they letting A God defeat a white man when The God is in his first boxing match ever! Francis won this fight
I thought Francis had that
Glad I didn't pay... Oof. That's their favorite, of course he gets the judges decision. People probably had money on the line.
Fury punches like an AT-AT
But if we was in a cage fury was done… this the only thing I don’t like about fighting… always mma going to boxing because boxers know they will get crushed in the octagon
This is crazy. Let’s see Francis vs Joshua or wilder. If he can win then he deserves to have a rematch which he could win. Don’t see him beating usyk though
Yea okay bud
Fury lost that fight they robbed Ngannou smh
Francis had a moment of glory (actually more than just one), but that wasn't a terribly damaging knock down.  Not like what Wilder did to him.   Fury was wide awake enough after that punch to even look down at the ground while he was falling.  Shame on Fury for letting that happen.
I don't know, based on Fury's showing here, he's very vulnerable. Someone more experienced like Anthony Joshua might actually beat him if he somehow fights and gets through Wilder.
Glad to see Francis back in the ring
There gonna be a rematch
The only thing I'm going to say is he gave him a good fight and he's MMA other boxers couldn't do that to fury and he did
Why the high lights the winner is getting his ass whooped..smh
This is total robbery. This entire fight was so one sided with Ngannou dominating the entire fight, so much so that Fury looked like he had never boxed and still gets the win. Really? Do the judges have eyesight or are they really this biased? This blows my mind.
Even Tyson fury at the end knows, ain’t no way he was going to win
they need to run this back now that ngannou has experience in the ring.  Give him another camp and he's the champ
Francis was robbed
2 highlights..got it
I’m not gonna take away from Francis amazing if he keeps on he has a bright future at the head of the table. But did it ever seemed like fury cared about this fight, the only thing I saw him care about is keeping his head off the canvas again, and getting paid at the end of the night.
I thought Francis would get waxed i hope he keeps boxing
All highlights were from Francis how did Fury win?
But he got hit in the back of the head 🤡 also that intentional elbow. Didn’t he have all these things incase Francis did anything mma 😂 by his rules he should be the loser not the winner
I haven't really trained but (oh and have a torn rotator cuff) so I don't think I could beat him right now....I think maybe  Tyson Fury would win a split decision over me too.  so nothing to be ashamed of
Francis@👏👏👏👏👏👏
And this is why boxing is not recognized as a serious sport anymore they protect their champs way to much lmao
Boxing is a joke!
Fraud.
I think Francis is where he belongs! He looks way better as a boxer! Makes deontay wilder look like an amateur
Fury totally lost
“ WHAT A FIIUGGHHHT” there was maybe 49 seconds of highlights in this 2 min video and half of it was the knockdown
Francis just needs a little more speed on his punches and it would have been lights out. Start working the speed bag Brother. I am a big Fury fan,but have to show some respect.😋
Props to Francis with knocking him down everyone doubted him REMATCH Francis WON
Let's be real here, N'Ganou got robbed. I guess this will reignite the hot debate between martial artists and boxers 😮‍💨
He is a MMA fighter , not a boxer, and he still won that fight, mad props to Francis, he got robbed
And they say boxing is real. LMFAO 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Ngannou got elbowed AND scored a knockdown..smfh. might as well watch WWE. At least they ain't hiding the fact that it's scripted.
I think he can beat jon jones
Francis looked bad dancing like a goon at the knockdown. Show some class.
Unfortunately, one knockout doesn’t win an entire fight in the sport of boxing, but Francis is a beast. I hope Tyson learned a lesson to take things more serious.
It was an exhibition match.  Ngannou fought well, but Fury was far from in fighting shape and it didn't look like trained seriously for this fight.  These type of matches are becoming more common as a money grab for the fighters.
I my eyes he won his first boxing match
Robbery.
Bravo! Francis Ngannou proved them wrong, never judge a book by it's cover.
The only thing now for Francis to do is beat Jon jones
Everybody including Fury himself knows he didn't win. They booked an undisputed fight for Fury b4 even fighting Francis. Everybody should boycott that fight to send a message
Robbery
he paid off those two judges.
Racism is real 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ this shit here is not right!!
Fury lost how did they give him that decision
I think Francis would win a rematch. He just needed to let those hands fly
Boxing would never allow their champion to lose to mma
Even with a elbow and a fury knock dwn he still won't 😂🤦🏾‍♂️
😅😅😅 Fury bought this 🥇 threw elbows and he's a cheater 😮. Screw him. He's weak look how he couldn't stand up straight 😅😅😅
I knew if Francis didn’t put him out he wouldn’t win boxing would never allow it I mean 1 point victory and he threw in a elbow boxing is ducking shit boxers think their the pretty boys but kick boxing does 50 percent more Muay Thai 75 percent more and mma 100 percent more than boxers boxers are shit and a bunch a pussie
Ngannou is the first fighter Fury couldn’t lean on the wear him down. Francis lower half is stronger than his upper half. He has an unparalleled God given strength.  He easily pushed Tyson off of him. Iron Mike alway said his power was in his legs.
Francis Ngannou WON this fight!
I hope fury hits the gym for his next one.
Damn I didn’t thing it would go down like that.
They robbed Francis
Fury lost that fight
With that much power Fury had to fight smart.
Beat Jon Jones Next Sheesh!
Francis is Heavy Weight Champ of MMA & BOXING!
Francis won
Yup I told y’all fury was gonna try an throw cheap shots to win crazy if ngannou was younger and more elusive Tyson would’ve went night night
Fixed, for a rematch, bigger payday for both fighters, it's been going on for decade's!
This was hilarious 😂
Tyson Fury always gets away with the wins since his first loss was with wilder but those judges are sellouts
This is some bullshit and everybody knows it
Francis got robbed
I can’t be bothered with boxing anymore. All of these boxers talk mad crap when they won’t even step in the octagon?
This is what’s wrong with boxing. 😠
Thats what it looks like when Fury fights someone his size.😂😂
There’s just something absurdly unlikable about fury.
That elbow proves that Fury is a dirty fighter..
Judges.... All I saw was a knock down on a so called "elite" boxer from a non-boxer. That's a win.
Nah based off those highlights Francis definitely won that, and that's coming from a Fury fan.
Damn I saw my first view of the video saw Tyson fury drop down WTF
Rigged
How 😂😂
It was perfect ending. Possibilities are endless.
Brits: Usyk looked so beatable against a #1 boxing contender. Man Fury is the greatest…he won a split decision against a man who had never boxed before. GOAT! 💀
Can you imagine a non boxer knocks out/know down 3 MMA world champions..?? Oh wait that did happen but no big deal .  Now an MMA champion Knock down a boxing heavy weight world champion.!! Everyone okay let’s make a big deal because it wasn’t Jake Paul 😂😂  Y’all are funny dude!!
Tyson fury is the worst heavyweight to ever box.
Fury knows boxing, scoring and how to outpunch/outscore people.  It's really too bad we'll never see Jones/Ngannou in the UFC.
The second fight would be even better.
Wtf
Francis won that fight.
Bro got robbed smh
Now they both should go mma style and see who wins.
This just goes to show how boxing is overrated.
Nothing but respect for Francis… nobody anticipated him putting forth this level of competition. He shocked the world. I don’t necessarily think scoring a knockdown was super shocking. Everyone knows the power he possesses. But the way he went toe to toe with Fury and boxed him on such a high level was absolutely amazing. Watching live, I was definitely caught up in it, thought he should have his had raised at the end… and being honest, really wanted to see, after what he did in the ring. That said, I watched back, and I think they got it right. Fury got a lot of uneventful 10-9 (rounds you don’t want to give him because you feel he should be performing to a higher standard). But getting those preconceived notions out of your mind, he did objectively win. Still, I was in awe watching Francis box Fury, and was definitely rooting to see him shock the world at the end.
They did a beautiful job, good fight.
God bless all glory to God prayers in Jesus name amen God loves you and I do too
Tyson ain’t as bad as he tinks 😂
We all know Francis won
LMAO THEY BLIND
Who makes these joke highlights. smh
This just tells you boxers in this era are trash
Complete bullshit. Francis won and everyone knows it.
MAN!!! that's F Up Tyson F got his ass beat hands down..#whiteMansWorld 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾
This is why Jon Jones waited Ngannou's contract out before transitioning to heavy weight.
Francis robbed …..
This is why nobody pays for Fury fights
MMA always wanna fight boxers knowing they are not conditioned enough to go past the 5th rd. if he woulda got in shape for 10-12rds it would been a different fight. frances was gassed out.
Wasn’t just the knock down Francis was competitive landing good punches all night
Fury needs to retire if he wants to keep his record undefeated!! He got lucky with this win that he shouldn’t have got. One more fight against anyone who’s not a complete bum, and he’s going to lose. He’s done
Fury fights dirty
FAAAAAAKE.
Someone have Wilder watch this fight with his notebook
Francis won
Big respect to Francis! The Gypsy King just keeps shocking me. He reminds me so much of the joker in that they really don't look like athletes but man they know what they are doing!
This is total faggott bullshitt, Francis Ngannou won that fight, more importantly Tyson fury would never happen the octagon with Ngannou. ㅋㅋㅋㅋ😂
He won if u ask me 0-0, goes straight for the heavyweight king and knocks him down n goes the distance ofc he’s not gonna win he came from mma
Francis won this fight 💪💯🎯‼️
FRANCIS IS NO SURPRISE..DUDE IS AN ATHLETE WHO CAN FIGHT... THAT'S DANGEROUS FOR ANY BODY THAT GETS IN THE RING
With Francis performance. Id love to see him box again.
That elbow should of put him back in points cmon. Francis did incredible and had fury fazed
Boxing has been Bullshit for Awhile!!!!.😒
They are getting payed to lie for Tyson fury he’s  a loser Francis beat the shit out of him and so did Deontay wilder
Effing robbery... That's another reason why boxing is losing fans to MMA
Can't say how many rounds this was because turned it after the 5th round for football. If they what to make this legit for me, maybe make it 12 rounds next time. I'm sure this wasn't 12 rounds.
Hold up so fury didnt get a knockdown but wins the friggin fight 🤔🤔🤔🤔
If that's ALL the highlights,  than how did Fury win again?
We need ngannou vs wilder
Wild How Fury steamrolled all his opponents like it was nothing. Rarely ever saw the man get weak feet against an opponent, and FRANCIS, a UFC fighter, goes the distance and wobbles fury? Jesus!
Can’t stand either of the furries.. none of them ever clearly win any of their fights.
They need to fight MMA now.  Ngannou looked like Ike Ibeabuchi out there for a little.  He is still a winner in my book
Most rigged fight, I would of bet my money on fury cause sincerely I thought fury would of had Francis within the first 4 rounds or so but Francis looked like more of the boxer and definitely won. He was in control and scored better. If I was fury I genuinely would of refused that belt.
Boxing sucks
Considering Francis been hit with 4 ounce gloves been elbow been kick in the head , he took that elbow like a champ , like most mma fighters would , he’s one solid human being
They robbed him of the title.....fury started sneaking elbows in like he does with others he faught.....but we know boxing would've let Francis win thats like kimbo taking the title from Ali.....this is all staged to merge mma with boxing.
Tyson won the match but lost the fight. Look at his face 💀
Pinches panothones
STUPIDEST Highlight clip Ive ever seen !  I watched the fight & you showed 0.099% of the fight. Fuck ESPN
He definitely won that fight but okay🤦🏾‍♂️
Robbed
Rematch in Vegas
Smh if Fury got in Joshua shape he’d be the best EVER 🤦🏽‍♂️😂😂😂
So glad I didn't pay for this shit!
Francis took that fight
Punk azz white boy knows he lost. White supremacist culture cannot let go of their great white hype.
ABSOLUTELY WILL NEVER WASTE ANY OF MY TIME WATCHING THE CORRUPT SPORT OF BOXING AGAIN!! RAY CHARLES COULD A SEEN FURY LOST THAT FIGHT!! STRAIGHT BUM N🤡 GET KNCOKED DOWN, N NEVER DOMINATE A DUDE THATS A UFC FIGHTER LOL. FRANCIS GOT ROBBED NO DOUBT! CONGRATS TOO THAT DUDE FOR SACRIFICING N PUTTING N THE BARD WORK, N ACTUALLY BEATING DUDE, TOO HAVE THAT SHIT, TAKEN FROM YOU!! LOL SHITS CRAZY💯
Damn that Elbow at 0:53 was dirty
Rocky is more believable than his story
Look like fury lost to me...and how 96 93 on a score card HE BEAT THAT MAN UP VICIOUSLY
Wow Francis got straight up robbed
Rigged
my as well hold it on an oil rig… 💰🌴💰
I didn’t see the fight, but I see the two faces
Where are the fury highlights 😅
This was an absolute robbery
0:31 "I done got myself into some s**t!"
Switch sports right now you still got it OG
Ppl, gotta realize politics. In boxing it doesn't matter who won the fight but which fight can make us the most money. Fury signed the usyk fight and ain't no way in hell will they're ruin their chances making more money with the fight. Imagine if they gave to Francis what then for usyk, what then with 100 million ppv buys. Guys instead of being so small minded open your brains and look at the bigger picture.
Possibly the most obviously rigged fight in history.
Even Tyson knew for sure he didn't win and yet he won 🤦🏾‍♂️ make it sense
To everyone on planet Earth who watch this fight, tell me how did fury won? What did the judges see? Or am I tripping or did I missed something
BS Call
HOW DID HE LOOSE ????? I hate this place 🤦🏾‍♂️
Ngannu vs Wilder next
Robbery
Right above the ear
Man this shit looks fake
Francis did very well, considering hes first time boxing was with the current best heavyweight boxer. I'd be scared to fight him again if i was Tyson.
The people that ordered this are the same ones that still watch WrestleMania.
Rigged
Rob my dawg Francis
They did my man dirty he had a knockdown
Come on fury lost that shit they didn’t wanna see they great white hope lose it’s ok cuz his time coming 😂
Francis is a dangerous man
First of all. Francis won that fight. Walked him down like the predator. Tyson looked like Charlo in there.
Unlike every other one of these boxing vs mma crossover fights, these guys actually look like they hit one another.
No way this phat slob won this fight, fury got the cheat one more time! What does he get on his knees and blw the judges in the back room! He lost fair and square! Fury you sck
Francis won that fight this is complete bs
Ngannou got robbed… 💯
This is what Tyson Furry is when he don't cheat. He's a complete fraud
Francis looking roided to the extreme and gypsy king is dad bod as always
And the white supremacist judges strike again
Francis won that fight 100%.  I mean they can’t really let a world champ boxer fall to a mma guy 😂. Francis did work on that head
All I saw was Tyson got laid out then he elbowed Francis in the head. Shouldn’t have gone to decision but that’s how it goes when it’s left up to the judges. If Francis went down after that elbow it would’ve been game over for Tyson. Problem is, Francis made that elbow look like nothing.
They are buddies and this was so fake
Francis won.
Good Job FN! You’re the winner. They couldn’t let a UFC guy get the win over a champion boxer. No matter what…
That should be atleast draw
As a Black American most of us come from what’s known as Cameroon 🇨🇲 through the slave trade so you understand where that dog comes from
Fury never was a big puncher. Put Francis against a big puncher and let's see how it goes.
Francis Ngannou won🥇
Huge respect. Imagine your first boxing match is against the champ, the best in the sport. The nerves alone would kill most people’s chance. But he handled all of the pressure and Tyson like he’s done it a hundred times. A Debatable Split decision against Fury for your first boxing match. Insane skill shown by Francis
Tyson couldn’t knock him out
This was so fake. Boxing is just like wrestling  all script.
This is why boxing is dieing and mma is on a rise. Terrible choice by the judges.
Great fight
Boring af
Meanwhile: Dana White asking his newly crowned "Slap Fighting Champions" to slap him.
Congrats to Francis. The fans love what's happening in this man's life. Praying more blessings come to him and his family.
Francis won the world over...People's Champ
Ok. Black dude got robbed!!!! Boxing over seas is definitely fixed!!!
Fury’s punch recovery is his greatest skill
This man who is not a boxer went the distance against the heavyweight champion. That alone is a win.
Spectacular debut by Francis but he didn’t win enough rounds
Francis won, foght was stolen from him he won hands down! They should have disqualified tyson for that elbow! Dirty fighter...
ROBBERY!!!
Fake af this wwe
This proves that ngannou would beat the shi out of Tyson Fury in a street fight
Ngannou is the best we saw coming from ufc 🤷 and i think he won to
That's why I don't look at boxing anymore this is bullshit
Fury acted like he knew the decision was in the bag. It probably was.
Just from the highlights, Tyson should’ve lost by 2-3 points from the knockdown and the elbow in the face… smh
Francis won that shit for sure. Got a knockdown and Tyson threw that elbow to the face. I’m no expert tho but I think a lot of people would agree Francis is the real winner
Great fight, Francis did a great job but fury dictated the pace and Francis just got lucky catching him off balance. Definitely Francis has a future in boxing if he wants it. Fury is just a badass, he's a street fighter with boxing gloves on. Got knocked on his ass and got up and still won.
Rigged..
96-93 Fury?? The refs were paid.
He had him on the run for a minute
Man if you cant tell the elbow was intentional youve never been a fighter. He pushed that elbow into his face. It was a self defense type if move. He was scared of getting walked down. That "punch" was way to vertical to be a missed thrown anything. He even made full eye contact and there was no remorse. No pause. No oop my bad. Ntn. Fury is a bum now. How he jumped when he won. He knew he lost but was going to take the W. That whole camp is remedial and they definitely bit off more than they could chew.
Robbery
That look staged
Not sure if Tyson Fury wants a rematch with Ngannou. Ngannou is one boxer who is stronger and made Tyson Fury fight on his back foot. Tyson Fury could not gain the advantage in the later rounds by leaning on his opponent cause Ngannou has an MMA background and created separation so that Fury could not use his weight on top of Ngannou. Ngannou is still new to boxing, but with a few more years of training, I think he could win the championship.
The most embarrassing night for boxing
Francis ate that elbow😬 chin strong asf, ain’t even look like it affected him.
Francis doesn’t win cuz he is black
The king elbowed Francis when he got frustrated. Mad respect for Francis, he showed he wanted it.😮😮😮
Francis got robbed
Boxing is more choreographed and corrupt than pro wrestling.
Bro this man elbowed him did they take points away?
Bring fairness to Sport.. Fury was favored
Boxing is rigged!!
This is a match that Fury and his team , knows they did not win .. Fury clearly favored .. even John Fury after talking too much … he was shocked and knows his son was defeated ..
Very controversial fight.
😂😭😭 Tyson Got His Ass Beat And They Got Mad…. SMH Punks
Fury with the dirty elbow! Francis won that fight. They gave it to Fury because he has to face Usyk for the Belts!
Hope no one paid for the boring fight. Fury is on out of shape joke who has never beat anyone good.
even tho Francis “Lost” He looked so good for his first boxing fight as a ufc fighter most ufc fighters would last a few rounds than get knocked out but Ngannou lasted the whole fight didn’t get knocked down but Ngannou knocked down fury and had some mean combos big props to Ngannou for taking this fight and looking very well
Boxing was not gonna let fury catch a L no matter what, it would of took the value of his title fight down tremendously
It's crazy how the MMA community is keeping the sport of Boxing alive. If Conor never fights Floyd I don't think we ever see these matches.
Yal misunderstood what happened,  They both took the money, had a little show to put on, went home. Just a money thing  Not a real fight.  Tyson went super easy on the guy BTW
rigged
Wilder vs Francis will be like Broly vs Gogeta! Gotta seee it
Somebody explain to me how Fury fought better than Ngannou! From what I can see, Ngannou dominated the fight, and all Fury did was land a big elbow which Ngannou ate like nothing and it's illegal.
Tyson Fury is a big sausage.
I’m not with that elbow!! Liked Fury but lost a lot a respect for him doing that! Robbed Ngannou!
I know Dana is seething
😮😮😮UR ...CHAMPION WAS fighting for his "LIFE" the title he was put on his Bottom with a left hook he was stopped... dead in his tracks like a Ferocious Bear meeting a Shot-Gun,Slug...😮Weee He finally met his match...POUND for POUND&MAN-😮-A-MAN-😮.... GREAT FIGHT BOTH DID VERY WELL
Course they give the split decision to the white men😒 yay the white men 🎉
Mad respect this dude decided to hop in boxing and not only fought a real boxer but one of the best ever boxers
Wow absolutely cheated that man i hope he got paid 100 million dollars he won that dam fight. How does a guy who got a knock down lose the fight specifically when the opponent is 6’10 300 pounds???
This is both Francis’ debut, and the end of his boxing career at the same time. Who would dare taking a fight against this monster now???? Specially in boxing where nobody wants to lose.
Gah damn right!!! Gypsy is king!!!!
Fury took that knockdown like "well, glad I trained for the distance ..it's gonna be a long night."   Proud of Francis. Fuck Dana White
The footwork and bobbing and weaving from Francis was impressive. Reminds me of Mike Tyson. Anyone know if they trained together? If they did, another camp with Tyson to solidify these techniques and I can see Francis being champ
Stupid announcers act like (1} Fury never fought heavy punchers or been knocked down by stronger fighters   And (2) Ngannou never flattened studs. Did they not see him END Cain Velasquez's career?!?!?!
now both furys have one only based off their name pathetic
Fury lost this shit!!!
Francis is a monster and definitely needs more practice in boxing but holt shit his physique and heart was insane. I knew he could throw hammers at fury but damn he did way better than I thought
Francis got robbed. This is the problem with boxing.

Fury was NEVER as good as advertised.  Ive been saying it for YEARS!  Fury is used to having either a 50lbs+ weight advantage or a 10in+ reach advantage or both!  He didnt have either last night and he couldnt bully in the clinch because all MMA guys know how to grapple.  He's never been particularly fast, or strong and his footwork is just average, but his size and ring IQ made up for alot of that. If not for his sheer size he'd have lost years ago.  Francis finally exposed it, but the judges and refs propped Fury up yet again just like they did in the Wilder fight.
Verguenza el boxeo
Francis was robed. There was no way the judges were going to give the win to someone that had zero experience in the boxing world no matter how many times Francis would have knocked him down.  Francis just proved boxing is fake and rigged.
Fury ain’t nothing but a cheating scum bag who just got his ass whooped
White People are still cheating.. Tyson Furry has always won by cheating. There's nothing here to see..
If francis went forward omg it would've been crazy he knew where he was probably the whole time
Just actors. Boxing is money making soap Opera.  Plotted out for optimal $$ Fury is a horrible boxer.
Frances fought Tyson better than any of his previous heavyweight matches
NO DOUBT the Baddest Man on the Planet.  So happy for him. He is such a hard working, humble man.  A True Champion.   SUCK IT JON JONES,
Francis was way too strong in the clinch
Fury intentionally came out with that elbow just to cheat as usual
You can’t even cut highlights to make Tyson look like he won
Francis got ROBBED!
He won, this shit is rigged
Rematch rematch
This is why people hate the heavy weight division and watch the lighter weight divisions.
They played him
If this was MMA or a real fight, Ngannou would have stopped fury, because there are no 10 counts in MMA. AFter that Knockdown, Francis would have mauled fury with ground and pound and he would have been slept.
If the fight was that close francis should've won via point deduction from am elbow and a knockdown score imo.
Furys trash
Fury lost
Francis on the rise?!
This "fight" was definitely just to sell tickets. Never was a match. Just a circus.
Everybody talked all that shit saying Francis was going to be outboxed absolutely wrong and btw Francis scored a knockdown and fury threw an elbow like wtf no way he won the decision
I don’t know, based on THESE highlights, I thought Ngannou won.
I didn’t watch the fight but based on the highlights it looks like Ngannou won the fight.
Stop saying fury is the best heavy weight in the world, he sucks.
Tyson hands down lost that fight
These “boxers” aren’t tough. Wanna empress ufc fans? Someone needs to step into the octagon. WOW A professional boxer won vs a ufc fighter SHOCKING
Francis kind of moves around the ring like Trevor Berbick.
Did we all watch the same fight????
Why are there Arabs In the ring? It’s not even there sport. They have nothing to do with boxing. Unless did they buy it
Booooo. CALL THE FIGHT THE RIGHT WAY…. HE GOT THE KNOCKED DOWN, NO FURY KNOCK DOWN,,,,WEAK WEAK WEAK….
I’m starting to think Tyson held back for TV …. Set up a rematch
Holy fuck Francis! Amazing performance! He could be one of the greats in boxing, unbelievable against someone like tyson.
Big fat got beat up by big big
They need to look down at that elbow and reverse the decision anyone throwing those cheap shots shouldn't win let alone be champion
Highlights show a one sided fight ends with a split with the guy getting beat winning.
Elbow punch?? What Saunders try on Canelo if u look at fight
Francis won this, hands down....
Fury has got to tone up his body. He's in worse shape every fight.
How does Francis lose if he got a knock down?? That elbow didnt even phase him. Fury looked scared like he was hanging on for dear life!
Actual horseshit
Francis was robbed !!!!
Francis I felt like he won.
Split decision my ass bro.
The problem is not whether he was robbed or not but how the WBC will be able to convince the future generations that the man who was on the floor was the one who defeated the one who was standing 😁
We all know Fury did not train for this fight like he should have, but respect to Ngannou.
He did better than Connor, who would have thought Francis would be the one to represent MMA in boxing.
Its completely and utterly amazing how someone can lift their arm in victory even after an disgraceful defeat 🤦🏽‍♂️.
SMH WOW FURY LOST THAT FIGHT …. BOXING IS RIGGED…..
The fact they didn’t take a point after he threw the elbow is wild. Should be A draw.
say what you want francis won lmfao
Nah Francis never went down knocked down fury once and well it's clear who won by looking at the faces after the match
Def was robbed
This fight looks fake af
Imagine if this had happened to the likes of Wilder, Mayweather, or AJ People would have been sshowing them no kind of love they wouldve been trashing them.....
I know fury embarrassed
Could have been AI for all we know lol
I would of wore a shirt in the ring if i had tysons body
Respect
Wow
Looks fake af
GREAT sportsmanship!  👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
You can see it in his face furry knew he lost
The Power of Francis 🤯
people who thought francis would win lolololol
This is why you need to go back to OLD OLD School rules, fight untill someone quits or gets knocked out.
Fury body looks like he should not be winning🤦🏾‍♂️ also, he def. Lost
Ngannou got robbed
This was a bs decision. Francis won
Fury lost this fight idc
Tyson was very confused and scared after he felt that power to ear!!
You see wilder this is how it is done dang
Fury been dirty and he lost this fight  Tyson a great trainer
Is Francis gets Mike Tyson back on the team this time as his full time trainer, he beats Fury in a rematch. Lets hope this happens!
Riggggggggggggggggged sports suck now days everything is about Vegas and betting no honor in any of these sports
Pure Robbery!!!
Stoopid
Mad respect to Francis. His fighting talent cannot be denied. Respect + 1 million brother
Ngannou normally won this fight (by split decision?), not Fury. Ngannou had a knock down. Ngannou backed and walked Fury down the ring the more. Fury probaby wrapped and tied Ngannou up as much as Ngannou did if not more. Ngannou looked tired at one point, but so was Fury. Fury never connected a solid and convincing punch except for a few lights jabs here and there.... Ngannou with a mma background won his first boxing match LITTERALY AND FUGURATIVELY against the world number heavyweight boxer. Now, that is an ACCOMPLISHMENT! Good job fellow, we are proud of you'
Tyson dirty dirty
Yall better deleted his video.   We know what greatness is and it is not our boxing now
Honestly an amazing performance by Francis. Very very few people can say they put Tyson fury on the canvas before.
If McGregor were to have won back then. I wouldn't be able to tell which would have been more impressive
Francis got robbed wtf ☑️ ng is rigged
What an underwhelming fight pretty sad really 🤷‍♂️🤣
LOL.  Fury wins because of politics.
They gotta promote tyson vs usyk. Of course they wasnt gonna let tyson lose.
I get it. Fury needed to win to not hurt the boxing image.. but francis won that fight in my opinion.. idk what fight judfe number 2 saw giving a 96/93 to fury.. smh.. but im happy for francis. Showed heart Dedication and took this serious.. and got PAIDDDDDDDD.
I just love the fact these guys showed respect to each other during the whole fight. After each round and the end
He got a chin nganou
642
Yall are stupid. Tyson wasn't trying. Just like mayweather. This was a pay day thats its. Let francis fight those other fighters in heavyweight who's willing to fight him. He's gonna get destroyed.
Racism 101
Looks like he just gave himself
They cheated again!
How many rounds was this they literally hit each other twice 😂
And boxing is still fixed😂
What is the point of watching Boxing or football anymore? Everything is so rigged and we as an audience so stupid
Robbery. Francis won that fight
Great job Francis 👏
Split decision but he knocked him down yea ok
Let me explain something for all you boxing fans who don't know MMA, Francis has improved significantly over the years in MMA with his wrestling and striking. He is a force to be reckoned with. I was very surprised when he knocked down. Tyson. Very impressive!
BS Fury lost
Bro that knockdown was fake 😂😂😂
Francis should have been a boxer instead of MMA fighter
Fury ought to be ashamed. And was scheduling future fights before the Francis fight even happened. And had to resort to throwing illegal elbows😂. One day Fury will admit he didn’t train worth a dam for this fight but it doesn’t matter. The images of this fight and outcome are now a part of funny man’s legacy.
Inspirational 👍
Fury is not very good against someone his own size. When he cant bully them with his lard, he cant do much.
Everyone please go to the elbow. Look how Fury doesn’t try to punch when he throws the elbow. Ducks his hand brings arm across. Smooth elbow. Hell of a chin Francis
Wish Ngannou would battle Jon Jones in the UFC. That is the fight everyone wants to see
This dude has more guts than that fraud broner
Throwing elbows…
Nahh Rematch
When fatty loses a point for an illegal elbow,we have a different result.
Just another in a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNGGGGGG line of terrible referee decisions in order to keep the next fight scheduled. Francis had to literally knock Fury OUT of the ring in order to win. They were never going to let Francis win because it would have meant the Usyk  vs Fury was not a Title fight. It didn't matter Francis, was never winning by decision.
They robbed that man SMH.
Fury won by 1 point lol 😒 I’m tight tho
They rigged it
Was it a boring fight ? I missed it :(
Those Arab guys were probably telling Francis relax there’s enough money to go around for everybody 😂Francis just put himself in line for some massive paydays
It still blows my mind watching Tyson. He look so out of shape and uncoordinated.
Tyson didn’t do shit
Uh oh that was a close one the gypsy king almost lost that one. Respect to Nongonnu
Ngannou won that fight. Boxing is just a joke of a sport right now & doesn’t want their champ to lose to a MMA fighter.
ROBBERY IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
Its a ROBBERY!
Fixed fight. Boxing is pathetic
👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
I forgot how big that moodafuka is
Nobody is admitting that Francis was robbed...
Naganno fights with heart. I like his endurance and abilities to stay focus his a badass fighter one of top 5 in the world .
Dude stated he got hit in the back of the head? Dude he punched you in the ear. You’re embarrassed, as you should be. Plus you threw an elbow.
That’s crazy as fuck
Wow brother got robbed
Fury lost!
Tyson didn’t win that fight 😬
Great showing by Ngannau but Fury won the decision.  If you look at the stats Fury outdid him (57 to 33) in non body shots.  He had more non body power shots too (27-24). You will win more rounds when you hit somebody more.  None the less Ngannau in large part took away his jab and made him struggle like none other.  He deserved all the credit in the world.  I don't think it was a fluke or Tyson not taking him seriously.  Ngannou's size and power just presented problems Tyson hasn't dealt with in awhile.  He couldn't dirty box him like he's done so well vs Wilder and just isn't what he was defensively since aging/ gaining that weight.
Francis needs to fight wilder next.
No shot he got beat up this shits rigged in all ways
Tyson. Was playing with him all night tyson has a resl match in December  is tune up fight.
That was real BS at  its finest!!!!
Two 95-94 vs one 93-96 is bull lol
I say that shii rigged we really thought they was gone let a UFC fighter beat the WBC world Champion
So we just gonna ignore the fact they robbed Ngannou?? Fury also cheated... AGAIN!!!   COMMENT SECTION looking like a bunch of participation trophy kids, nahhh they straight up don't deserve to have Ngannou for what they just did
This might be the greatest boxing match in the last in the last few years
Francis won that all day
Wonder how close it would be in the octagon 🤷🏻‍♂️
Nice Frances true warrior. All I saw is how garbage fury really is.
This was incredible much respect to Francis wow and Fury a beast too both men are true fighters and legends
That's crazy fuck that yo got scammed
Why are his hands down
I love watching "unstoppable" men realize they're stopping.
Mike would have DESTROYED Tyson.
It lookedlike francis was walkin thru those punches? I didnt see the live fight but in the highlights it seemed like that..
Tyson FURY did enough to Win the fight,still the real KING,shut your pie holes. He will beat Usyk and then he will fight The MMA chump again.My bet will be on the KING AGAIN!!!
Ngannou ate that elbow like nothing
Fury! Lost! Wow!
Fury did not win that match but hey it is what it is I bet on fury But Wrong is wrong
I didn't think Francis would have this kind of success in his first boxing match against the best HW in the world. I'm so glad i was wrong. Such an amazing fight for Francis.
Francis Ngannou won the fight...but  they  give the belt  to the owner
For fucks sake every single mainstream fight that ends in a decision is like this. It was a good, competitive, close hard fight. I think Fury won by one round. If you gave it to Francis by one round i wouldn't think you're crazy. Wrong but not crazy. A draw eeeeh maybe. He outlanded Francis and controlled the pace for a majority of the fight. I think people are so surprised by how great Francis performance was that even very serious boxing fans think Francis won. Honest to God, tho. On a rewatch, I'm sure most people will see that he didn't. He proved he could hang with any heavyweight in the world, though. That's a win in my eyes. Not a robbery tho. Stop calling close fights robberys. Francis didn't push for the win in the last two rounds and played it safe, and judges hate that. It cost him. Everyone in boxing knows that if you want to beat the champ. You have to BEAT the champ. If it's a one round kind of fight, then put a stamp on the last round and prove you deserve the win. Idk. That's just me. Francis looked great. Fury looked more sluggish in this fight than I have ever seen him. He clearly severely underestimated Francis. Calling a fight that isn't a robbery a robbery is just as harmful to the sport of boxing than actually robberys nowadays.
Judges and ref cheated. Fury should've been disqualified for using his elbows. This is boxing and not MMA.
Francis holy shit that was impressive. Mike seems like a great coach. Please knock out Jake Paul
Francis Ngannou won the fight
Good job didn’t think he would do that good very well done
See Francis is getting a Lot of Love throughout Hundreds of these Comments. Must hv Won. Can't leave it up 2 Boxing Judges though!!
Francis destroyed
The elbow was insane
Fury wakes up when he gets knockdown
All I know is I don't want to hear anymore stupid ass Ali comparisons EVER AGAIN! Fury is now and forever King Dosser! He should be ashamed. Even in victory HE LOST as far as I'm concerned!
Sand bros whispered: No way could they have you win against the world champ. Btw ur rich rich now.
Imma stop watching this fixed ass sport...🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
This lacks highlights made it looks close for fury but missed a lot of Francis
Nah! 😂and NEW 🎉🎉🎉 robbery!
They gave it to the champ! Boxing always spares the champs
That first knockdown was fake
Wack Fury lost from what people telling me
They rigged bruh Francis should’ve won that 😂💯
Francis is the definition of last of a dying breed. He did that to the current champion and I’m sure Fury loved every minute of their bout. People need to seriously give Francis and Fury a bakers dozen of flowers cause what i witnessed was just more than combat sports but a demonstration of willpower going against incomprehensible experience resulting in respect only those 2 individuals could ever acknowledge.. holy shit I know Francis W/L just wanted the bag and Tyson had something to prove because the media instigated this to stupid portions, but wtf shoulda been a draw 😅
Good job Tyson with the win!!knew that was gonna happen
Bravo Ngannou
Ngannou had to lose for the money to flow. I felt like he won but he lost with such humility that I know it will all work itself out. And who better to lose to than the Gypsy King, himself, another boxer who exemplifies humility in the ring. This was just awesome to be able to see.
Francis won that, he got the only knockdown of the fight, did more damage, and got hit wit an illegal elbow. Run it back, this time better judges💯
tyson fury  a fake champ he aint shit
It that was an elbow? Dirty fight
Asi o mas descarado .el box ahora es un circo .y se ve la corrupcion a mas no poder que robo monumental😮
Man Francis should go into boxing cause he would be a violent fighter especially dropping Fury like that
Lol...that punch knocked down Fury? Ok
I lowkey think if Francis really tried he could actually be something in heavyweight boxing😂💯
Rigged I'm done with boxing
Rigged. Francis won.
Tyson is overrated.
This was fixed just like the Mayweather McGregor fight to make it closer fight.
Ngannou basically was Rocky
Francis won now his big mouth dad can shut the heck up,rigged like election he got TRUMPed
Fury got beat up. They couldn't let Fury lose. Francis beat him up.
That’s bull shit
I would say he got robbed, but Francis was never supposed to win. But Francis won that fight to EVERYBODY who saw it. Tell Dana White that number just went WAY UP!!!!
Francis bro you just started and are going against a Goliath. Keep it up. Your time will come. You’re next.
Francis won and got knock downs and more overall damage. It’s obvious
Tyson be cheating he meant to through that elbow
Mfs saying they impressed….. na dude was straight up robbed
I don't care what the record book says....Tyson "Gypsy Queen" Fury was handed his 1st loss, Francis was straight up robbed because the boxing world didn't want to jeopardize the hype of the Fury/Usyk fight!
Went the whole distance and only 2min Highlights
Robbery!!
Francis won idc
Sime one paid off the judges
Like always fury has to cheat. Throwing. Elbows to slow down other fighters.
All I see in the comments is people saying how good he was for his first fight.. But nobody saying If he was robbed of a title
Haha I still can't believe how many people think this was a "real" boxing match. This shit was more scripted then a WWE match. Do you guys honestly believe Fury was going all out in this fight? First Mayweather McGregor bullshit and now this. People are so damn gullible. Fury been doing this shit since he was kid and been taxing the best heavyweights in the world for years. Including Wilder 3x who is considered one of the hardest punchers in the history of HW boxing. Francis just started training few months ago and you think he could actually win this fight? Don't get me wrong, he's a bad man in MMA but boxing is a completely different sport. He was getting carried and he could've gotten taken out in the first three rounds if Fury was going 100%. Watch Furys previous fights and compare that shit to today. It was a money grab and their will be a big rematch for even more damn money. Cmon guys, don't fall for this shit. It was entertaining but this shit wasn't a "real" boxing match.
I’m skeptical because boxing is shady af… Glad Ngannou got paid though…
I thought Francis won it
Frank won
Judges are the worse
Tyson won with All Jabs if you watch the fight and His 1-2
Boxing is clearly fucking rigged and fake...Fuck that Francis obviously won this fight
Great fight from both fighters 🔥
Broad day robbery
This is about money. Second and third fight. Don't fall for the oldest trick in the book.
I think Francis won that fight , he took the fight to Fury and it’s obvious by fury’s face
Tyson was whooped, he took an L
When your phone freezes to see Vince watching the match 😂
Fights like this that go the distance ESPECIALLY split decisions should demand immediate rematch.!
Heavyweight is TRASH in these days
francis is such a humble sweetheart of a mf beast love this dude most people would be complete cocky assholes in his situation he’s gotta good soul fr
This shows Fury is straight up Garbage
Bs
This fight ruined boxing forever!!!
Tyson Fury got beat up 😂
Ngannou is a better boxer than Wilder
He was def shiting it haha but hey props to Frances he’s a beat too
I cant belive it... This man Ngannou followed a SOLID game plan for 10 rounds. Not ONE round did he start swinging for the fences or look nervous. He worked off his jab, threw body punches, fought Southpaw and even threw combinations. I thought he was have quicksand footwork, but he moved very freely in their being as heavy as he is. I dont think there was a punch that stunned or affected him badly either. His fundamentals were better than most current heavyweight boxers. With that being said, Ngannou easily could destroy the top 5 in HW boxing.
BS 🔙 Stop it  . . They got to be kidding 🥴 Too Bad . .  kimbo slice is gone . . RIP . .  But he would of love to fight fury 🤨
Usyk will destroy Fury.
Am I the only one who thought Francis won. I’m still so Confused Iv rewatched the fight and counted the punches I’m so confused
Lame ass shit......
Tyson thought it was going to be an easy fight.
They robbed Francis
He got robbed
Francis just tilted the earth to the other side 🌎 when he knocked down Fury.
Bro that 96:93 is fuckin crazy. Dude needs to be dropped asap
Fury LOST that fight. Boxing is a sham. Usyk is gna walk all over Fury.
Not bad bro
To the fury fan girls that are not impressed and saying “fury weathered the storm” do you realize how ridiculous it is to say that according to you guys “the best heavyweight boxer to ever live” almost lost to a mma guy who never stepped foot into the squared circle and on his debut almost beat the champion of the heavyweight division. Ngannou made Fury look easy to beat. That’s says a lot about Francis.
In a real street fight, Fury would’ve died
WOWWWWWW HOW THEY ROBBED HIM THAT MONEY WENT TO THEM TO CHEAT EVEN IN BOXING THATS CRAAZY 🤦🏾 DISGRACEFUL🤦🏾🤮🤮 🐀🐀 MOVES!!!
Tysons fat af
Ngannou would’ve won if he had more gas💀 and 3 more months of boxing training😭
Love how fury said Francis was fat
What a shit show 😅 Francis won that 100%
Rigged
That’s Bullshit how do people have any respect for boxing that is so clearly rigged
FN🎉
Fury got some heart..
Craziest part of this is, give Francis 3-4 more fights and he could actually be a legit world heavyweight champ
Rematch… RE - MATCH!
Francis is a fucking UNIT. I couldn’t see one time he was genuinely wobbled. Even the elbow didn’t slow him down. Modern day mini Mike Tyson fr tho
Shit is rigged how tf this nigga keep winning after getting knocked down I don’t understand!!!!
legal robbery 🤦🏽‍♂️
Fury was scared like Floyd and run after round 3 all night 😂😅
Of course they were gonna rob him.. It's boxing. What did you expect.
I’m confused how a guy who elbows someone in the face and gets knocked down still wins…. Boxing is rigged
They stole this fight from that man
Well I lost $200
I love Francis' heart, but let's be honest, Fury is garbage 😂😂😂
Im so glad this man has gotten his opportunity in this sport. He’s overcome so much and continues to just be a great positive influence in every space we’ve seen him. Tonight i think everyone was an ngannou fan
Bro....dude threw a solid elbow that's how you know he was desperate ASF
Francious won that fight
Everyone said our boy was gonna get knocked on his ass, everyone said he didnt have a shot. Everybody said the Gypsy King was gonna walk all over him... and Fury DID win...by split decision, against a man making his boxing debut. Connor want that close with floyd. No MMA fighter has ever been that close, especially against the caliber of boxer that is Fury.  Francis Ngannou... What.a.Legend
Wilder who
Fight was rigged.
Point deduction for elbow Frank wins but everyone blowing smoke like usual. Frank's fight
Shame on the judges that scored Fury higher. They were obviously corrupt or simply blind
It’s so obvious that’s some BS! Fury lost this fight and threw a cheap ass elbow.
Francis won this fight to be honest
Question why is a Muslim holding American Western belt.
If Francis train more he will beat fighters like Anthony Joshua and Wilder
Alistar Overeem was probably yelling at the TV feeling vindicated finally, that being said I hope he gets a rematch with a massive payday.
Robbery
Imagine if Fury did not rely on talent and mediocre work, but also dieted properly and put in some hard work. Man what a monster he would be.
Can you image how Francis will be after a few years of training.
If there was a point deduction (there should have been) Francis would be the Heavyweight Boxing Champion of the world
Robbed
Fury losted that fight hands down
Francis will only get better he has accomplished so much already and has shown that he can stand and bang with the heavyweight champ. Give him some more time if he so chooses to continue box he could become the new champ.
Fake fight folks.
English bastard elbowed. Like Holyfield hitting with his head.i think tyson fury wasn't deserved it.
Tyson fury couldn’t survive in the 80’s boxing. He’s just a hype
96-93?! Someone was bought...
Boxing isn’t a real sport. Fran just showed the world todays best boxers are subpar to the true legends.   It’s no secret it’s a sport that is basically dead. One man just killed it officially.
Fury was looking more like a martial artist, with a blatant, crisp elbow strike
Fury thought it would be easy and didn’t train as hard as he should have and Francis truly has freak power and can knock anyone in the world out. Hopefully this wakes Fury up because he will get worked if this is the effort he puts out against Usyk
In a real fight Ngannou murks him.
I am an old boxer and Ngannou won that fight. You can see Mike Tyson’s tutelage in Frances. Rematch Needs to happen!!
The elbow was accidental as Fury pulled his right cross back to not devastate Ngannou. This fight was fixed folks. What a joke. 😂
Ngnou won
Nobody talking about the elbow to the face
Two facts after watching this fight: 1. Ngannou won hands down. 2. Fury is overrated AF and only wins due to size advantage. Ngannou schooled him from start to finish.
Furry bro sit your slow ass down you didn't move anything like when you fought deontay wilder..you should lost he tipped your ass the the floor!!FOH!!
Saudi making that bread. I watched the documentary of the Crown Prince . He really making Saudi better.. yeah he may have gotten dude off in turkey .. but Saudi doing their thing. They willing to give up some bread .
Francis could have finished him a few times but held back.... politics and money rule sports. In any reality Francis won and that is without him going all in for real.
IF Francis would’ve turned into that left hook like HE was suppose to don’t think Fury gets up Fury couldn’t use all that weight to win this fight Francis was easily pushing Fury off of him and when Fury doesn’t have that advantage HE is a average fighter at best I’ve ALWAYS SAID IT
Fury beat Ngannou, just like Paddy Pimblett “beat” Jared Gordon. Corrupt judges in both sports. Fans are sick of this garbage.
Cheated the man, plus ignored a elbow to the head.
First Tommy gets the decision very questionably. But this, Francis should’ve won. Starting to think this  gypsy family into making the odds in their favor.
Francis you did what no other ufc fighter has done in history . Today you are the champ in my eyes .
I have Fury winning 6 Round, Franics 2 Rounds with 1 Knock for extra point, Draw on 2 Rounds.  Fury had the most landed hits. Francis had the biggest hits.
Absolutely insane how good Francis is, he won the ufc championship heavyweight title fairly quickly in ufc and then to win one of the score cards against fury on his debut 👏
Sports are so rigged it’s dumb.  Francis won, fury through an elbow.  Francis scores knockdown.  Should’ve summed up how Francis won and fury loses points.  Load of BS, worst rigged sport out of all the fixed sports we got.
Francis did better than wilder shit lol
Fury is a dirty fighter
I knew from the get go they would cheat the African out of this match . They don’t want us to come up but they can’t stop the tsunami of talent that’s gonna hit the world in every sector real soon . Salute my African brothers and sisters
Fake fight
We need Francis the movie! While he’s alive
Ever see a robbery without a gun
Fake
Ngannou knows he won, and Fury knows Ngannou won too.
Most of these comment are from bots. He was robbed, he won the fight.
Dr eggman got away with murder
FN was robbed. I like TF but that was robbery
Definitely need to run this one back, lots of questionable scoring by the judges. Legit Francis scored a clean knockdown, and fury also had a really bad elbow that should’ve took off a ton of points and of course the elbow isn’t being posted anywhere. Honestly Francis should repeal that shit. Boxing is a fucking joke now. Put Tyson in an octagon and he’s cooked.
Ladrones todo esta lleno de corrupción
Fury knew he lost the fight. Look at his body language during and after the fight. The judges were not going to score the fight fairly. Ngannou was robbed. This type of BS is why people don’t follow boxing anymore.
The fix was in you dummies!!!!! This was a show to steal y'all gullible people's money. Fury had to make it look good and close or people would have been all over his ass. Wake up sheep
Absolutely boycotting these boxing matches till they fix yhis shit its been ridiculous
To think Fury lashed out at Joe Rogan for saying he wouldn’t stand a chance agianst Jon Jones. Frankly I’m tired of the MMA to Boxing cross over. Should of had a Boxing to MMA fight. Problem is Fury would of been mauled then. Two  different sports and one is clearly better then the other in terms of a actual fighting you would see if it were life and death. Enough is enough. These matches are just money grabs.
now include francis's skill set of kicking, wrestling, bjj and ground-n-pound that tyson has no clue of...    MMA wins, sorry
Francis will be back as a boxer
Highlights prove boxing is absolutely fake. Clearly unethical and immoral split decision!
Boxing going down the man was Robbed
I cant believe people think it was a real fight
How did the big fat guy win he was getting killed?
Congratulations Francis🙌 The People Know You Won That Fight..... Even in defeat He Won.  It was his 1st boxing match 💯 and he did this to the heavy weight champion of the world.... Please understand a split decision is a win.
Tyson is a true warrior.  He's been knocked down many times but ALWAYS finds a way to get up!
also illegal ELBOW to face wtf was that. tyson should not have won
Hats off to both these warriors! Francis gave a great account of his skills and deserves more great opportunities. Fury made it through, champions have those nights, the key is to get out of there with the titles, his undefeated record in tact,so in that sense it was a successful defense. Congrats to both!
why a fat guy is boxing 🥊?!
Just look at the damage. Francis won.
that knock down was to the side of the head from any angle. not the back like fury claims. if it was for those pillows tyson wouldve been slept in the cage with that cross
Francis proved the doubters wrong and he is a 🏆
BS decision. Ngannou controlled the whole fight. Striking stats were almost identical, more power shots landed, plus the knock down. Fury didn’t do a damn thing the last 3 rounds or so, yet he still gets the win? The fix was in, no way are they going to let Fury get his first loss against an MMA fighter. Even though Ngannou won hands down. Absolute embarrassment for the sport of boxing. Dirty ass, corrupt, judges. What a disgrace and robbery.
Robbery 😂😂😂
So fury cheated to win cool
all tyson did was hug. plus a knock down. idk but i understand its business in boxing
Robbery
Salute to you Franciss...damn badasss...now ask Fury to rematch you with MMA rule in octagon..😂😂
Anyone who says fury would beat a prime tyson is nuts lol
WILD ROBBERY lol
In a real fight Francis is making fury prey.
ROBBERY AT ITS BEST
That’s bs
Naw that shi was rigged
Robbery TF
Francis a un cœur de lion!!
Tyson took this fight lightly and was already looking forward to the fight with Usyk. I bet he does a rematch with Francis after the Usyk fight and puts Francis down within 5 rounds
Fury is a cheat and just another Great White Hope. Foh
Like many, I thought this fight would wind up being a b s spectacle like the Mayweather vs McGregor JOKE.  Francis came to fight and fight he did …quite impressive as he didn’t get thru decision but ‘won’ more respect and fans than did Fury who was probably more relieved than joyous with the decision
Straight b.s.
Jones is next
Jake Paul should fight Francis next 😂
🗑️🗑️🗑️
Boxing needs a guy like Francis! I’d like to see him and Deontae wilder fight! That would be fireworks
Robbery in your face🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
The boxing world robbed Francis and that’s not fair .
Guessing had to make sure Fury wins since he is facing Usyk for the unification bout.
Highway robbery
Huge shot by Francis
Yeah naw. Ngannou won that.
Francis won the fight
That's why I watch WWE it's much real than boxing from start to finish. 🤔🙄
Absolutely disgusting how they robbed Francis. That was such a clear cut win... I'm glad us viewers all agree, but the boxing world should be ashamed of itself.
Broad daylight Robbery... Shame on the judges
Rigged match
Francis was robbed clearly
96-93? What the fuck?
#realtalkfrfr #facts 🇯🇲 💯 ngannou was cheated and fury was cheating. Throwing elbows.
Definitely no corruption... that's for sure....solid judging....
Goes to show the judges will always be paid.
Comment sections has to be bots 🤦🏾‍♂️
Fury fat and out of shape. That was real garbage
Shit fake
Brah. Aint no way. Francis got ripped off.
How did he win this
Superman punch at end though 😮
So you can get knocked down and still win?!
I feel like a proud father
I didn't see Ngannou hurt. He walked Fury down exchanging with him and I thought Ngannou got the better shots on Tyson Fury. Francis Ngannou won inspite of the judges. Why do you think the majority of the fans in attendance were not happy with the decision?
Boxing is rigged
Anyone who is a true professional...should be in better shape! It's called discipline!
Fury is a master at avoiding punches and he often doesn’t have to take many but this doesn’t make sense how he won. I have lost some faith in boxing and does beg the question are certain situations staged for money and then ask yourself does Fury need the money for side hustles? No.
I thought Francis should’ve been throwing elbow? Tyson is just a dirty fighter.
Tyson Fury's unfair win was more similar to Israel's crimes in Gaza than anything else, which is easily reported in Israel's favor by having the power of the media.
Bs
Fury fucking lost anyone who says otherwise is on crack .. look at the scorecard
It’s this same outrageous nonsense that has made me stop watching boxing.
bruh how the he get knocked flat on his ass within the first 30 sec of the video and then the next minute is him getting ok punches and the random clean one but never dropping Ngannou but then  also leting Ngannou land hell punches
Bull shit 😂
I dont ever what to hear anyone compare Fury to Ali ever again.
Robbery, but a good fight regardless...respect
Francis Ngannou knocked daylight savings time out of Fury's mind. How could he lose to this has been?!
Mike Tyson DID
This isn't highlights wtf
Robbery
This is why boxing is ass this was a great fight for sure but how the fuck does a knockdown get you ahead on the board if I’m not mistaken Francis wasn’t knocked down once how was this a split decision Tyson should have had to get at least knockdown but hey like I said the sport is what it is
Francis Ngannoui won this fight easy lol
how you called yourself the best but got KO by a MMA lol
Francis won.
Who else had Fury winning this one....be honest after watching it do you agree with decision?
😂😂😂 YEAH RIGHT GREAT WHITE HYPE !!!
Wow huge congrats to Ngannou for an amazing job against Tyson Fury in his first boxing match gave him a better fight than Wilder did in 3 fights 😂 Wow can you imagine what Ngannou would've dun to Wilder 😮
Tyson a pretty dirty boxer that was a clear elbow
Doesn't francis has 3 losses in mma?so that means he isn't the baddest man on the plant?
Fury should’ve lost points for the elbow… And he was knocked down… I don’t think the boxing sport wanted an MMA fighter to have the Boxing championship… Francis had no visible damage after 10 rounds fighting the HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION and Fury might as well been hitting Francis with a pillow because he didn’t even look like he was in a fight after let alone 10 rounds… I suspect treachery…
Robbery
I love Fury, but I don't understand how he won
the great white hope🤑❌💯
Ngannou knock fury down what a left hand!!!!
ABSOLUTELY SMOKES WHAT CONOR DID !! He fought the current HW champion and lost by SD ! And knocked him down is amazing !! Huge Win for Francis !
Yall know damn well fury lost 🤦🏿‍♂️
😂😂 this is bullsh*t, Tyson lost.
Wow robbery, boxing takes another L.
In another reality Id love to have seen Francis Ngannou go into boxing as a younger man instead of MMA. He always wanted to be a boxer and man he could have been a great one. Not to diminish his MMA career, he is a legend regardless. But Im more of boxing fan. Ill look forward to Francis boxing again. He can make some noise even though he is already 37 and honestly I wasnt sure who won this fight. If not for the knockdown Id say Fury, but with that knockdown and the way Francis controlled the ring, always coming forward, solid defense,  willing to go for some big shots and land some.. I think Fury got really lucky 2 of the judges scored it the way they did. At no point did Francis looked phased or hurt, Tyson on the otherhand did.  Francis didnt seek the clinch, he stood toe to toe with one of the greats. I also think Fury needs to hit the gym a little in his later career, he didnt seem to have the same bounce and energy and power to his punches as he used to and when he fought Wilder.  Maybe this will motive him, cause he could have lost this fight on the cards. Well done Francis!
REMATCH
ngannou has a bright future in boxing, maybe ends up a champion in heavyweight div too
Look at fury face, look at frances. Fury got knocked down, francis was the aggressor, furry cheated as always elbowing this time..smh. wrong decision... but couldnt expect anything else in that rigged industry..   Cant leave anything to decision!
He won, they just wont give him the title
Nagganou beat him. End of story.
Francis looked impressive win lose or draw he looked amazing
Bro Francis is a scary dude 😂 way to show up tho.
I think this proves these fights aren't rigged  Between the fighters anyway.  Francis should of won
Fury said the other guy was awkward.  That's funny because Tyson is one of the most awkward and goofy fighters I've seen in a long time.
96-93 is DISGUSTING 😂😂😂 who tf takes boxing seriously🤣
😂 francis got robbed wow fury the greatest what?! Btw fury elbows dont hurt ufc fighters like that 😂😂😂😂
Am I the only on impressed by Tyson? I thought Francis would steamroll through Fury.  I understand this was Nganous first boxing match... but some of you dummies forget he knows boxing from fighting in MMA. This wasn't like he came from the NBA or the NFL and was just learning how to punch.
I find it hilarious that Fury's ass gets knocked down on the canvas twice against Wilder and once against a UFC fighter, and the judges give him the benefit of the doubt both times. If this guy ever boxed in Mike Tyson's Era, no one will know he exists
When are people going to state the obvious. Fury is getting too freakin' fat. Say what you want about padding, and it doesn't hurt his stamina, blah blah blah. You're carrying an extra 30 pounds for 40 minutes, trying to bounce and move. No way in hell he would not be better 20 or 30 pounds lighter. Usyk will put Fury down in Five.
absolute robbery.
Tyson didn’t have control, he lost
Don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t do what the entire world says you can’t, never be afraid of anyone and never back down. Ngannou proved too you all that he can go toe to toe with a champ he also has one of the hardest hits in the world. The champ got his bell rung and went the distance congrats too both of you and still one of the only reasons after breaking my arm that I still want too enter either ring ❤️  rigged  not rigged idc fightings in any way is just such a relief
Robo Total
He got robbed
I'll love to see a rematch. Even though I don't think Tyson won that fight, it would have been embarrassing for boxing if Francis had won.
ROBBERY!!!!!  INFURIATING!!!!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Francis won dat!!!! Only round he lost was round 6 before and after dat it was solid stop playing!!!
Francis looked strong and deserves a instant rematch. The Gypsy King looked sloppy and the elbow told the story he hurt and resorted to foul play I expect better from a world champion.
No he didn’t win he lost to a fat man. Just like the rest of Tyson Fury’s opponents. 😂🤷🏻‍♂️
This is why Boxing is trash and losing fans at a rapid rate
From the highlights looks like ngannou won? I haven't watched the whole fight but who did? Let me know  Tyson looked worried about the scorecard and ngannou looked confident
May God take the blind fold off our eyes. NGANNOU IS A Campion and he handled business points dedication for a elbow would have set records straight
#ROBBED #RIGGED Nyguanu controlled the fight, Judges must be paid off for the next Usyk fight. #Bullshit
I said that Tyson Fury is a bum! Real talk! He didn't do nothing!
Francis won
Sports are becoming so fake..Almost all sports seem to be scripted now it's almost embarrassing..Francis dominated Tyson but because of Tysons next fight paying out so much money it would have lost millions if Tyson would have lost. Nfl nba boxing its all wwe
Francs won. But the Saudi’s had too much money on the line.
Fury should of lost points for a elbow lucky Francis does mma
Fake bllsht! He got his a-whipped. I knew they was gonna cheat because he Socalled white. This is why I liked that Mike Tyson didn't let it go to the judges
I’m done watching boxing!! Nobody wants to win and it’s just a money grab. Trash fight along with the whole organization
You can tell Iron Mike made sure Francis did neck exercises. His neck looks like a human thumb.
Based off the 2 highlights I saw I can definitively say Francis won
Everyone who saw the fight knows Francis won.
Aint no way fury the heavyweight champ 💀💀💀💀
Not a fan of UFC fighters much since the GSP days but when a professional boxer gets his ass kicked by a UFC fighter in a boxing ring, it makes boxers look stupid!
I don't think anybody won this fight. One of these two were supposed to flatline the other. Tyson is the heavyweight champ and Ngannou was UFC heavyweight champ and holds the record for the hardest puncher. It wasn't a robbery, if anything it should've been a draw. Everybody including Iron MIke had Ngannou knocking Tyson out and Tyson claimed to be able to put Ngannou away. I don't see a win on either side. Its was more embarrassing for Fury though. On the contrary though, watching interviews; Ngannou's camp and other fighter analyst were saying for Fury to watch out for the clipping of a hook over the top of the head. That's what caught Fury! Seems kind of weird that lots of people knew the strategy to tryin' put Fury away🤔
They robbed that man
Bruh idk i was cheering for Fury  But honestly I think Ngannou got robbed
Ngannou got robbed
Ngannou is the King of the World. No man can beat him right now in any combat sport
EVEN TYSON AND HIS TEAM KNEW HE LOST THAT FIGHT! BOXING IS CORRUPT!
Francis "im just trying to survive" Ngannou
He did better in a boxing match than Woolley,asken,and Diaz hahah
This was nothing more then a performance to bait out a rematch and trilogy so both of them can make a few hundred Mill
The look he gave Francis when he was down hahahah. Tyson got nervous quick
Good job mike tyson for training the predator
Just looking at these two guys, you'd never guess who the underdog was 😂
This not fair ngannou suppostobe the winner.....
Fury better get his act together for usyk - he looked like a bum tonight
caucasians are nothing but lisrs
I had to giggled when Fury fell to his knees during a hug snf Ngannou instinctively wanted to sprawl and control the head😂😂
naw dog - if this is the baddest man on the planet match - Francis wins 100%. Nagnou in a death match 10/10 times
And next were going to have to watch jake paul fight another tomato  can.  Francis showed up and showed out.  Hes gonna be a problem
Man regardless you got to love Tyson fury he’s always so respectful even comes over to kiss Francis at the end I love to see the respect he has for everyone
Scandalous
I thought Deontay Wilder gave a better fight
Boxing score cards aren’t real, change my mind.
Fury is a dirty fighter…. Should be kicked out of boxing!
What!? If this wasn’t set-up to make Francis look competitive than he’s ready to whoop Deontay Wilder and after that, rematch and probably beat Fury to become the Heavyweight boxing champion 🤔 That’s weird.. Is he that naturally incredible or do boxers just kinda suck now?
wilder vs ngannou Now !!!!
Ngl this looked staged to me but I’m glad Francis got paid
Ok definitely didn't see that coming. I'll be the first to admit I didn't think Francis would do so well, let alone actually drop Fury. He should prob stick with boxing cuz he'll make a lot more money doing this than in the UFC and this was only his first fight
Francis won that
Supposedly this was a big thing today and ion even know about it as much  But I do like boxing🤔  Overall todays events were  1. FURY vs NGANNOU 2. EL CLÁSICO (Madrid 🆚 barcã) 3. San Judas day  Man what a time to be alive
Legit I thought Francis Won
What a fucking JOKE! But the joke is on US we keep thinking we gonnaee something real.
That knock down was definitely 10-8 but there’s still 9 more rounds to go and Ngannou didn’t do enough to edge the fight. IF he drop Fury one more time at the later round, surely he gets the W. 96-94 Fury!!!
Ngannou beat Fury. I don't care what those judges say. He scored a knockdown, walked right through a elbow uncut or swollen. Tyson left eye was not looking to good. The only thing I'm thinking was Tyson moved a little better but that comes with time. Great fight tho
Boxing is rigged but it has to be since it's connected to betting
WOW what a robbery, i will never order another heavy weight fight again !!
This was actually a really good fight. I'd like to see a rematch
omg this has to be the GAYEST championship fight ever. Imagine Lennox Lewis or Evander Holyfield just barely getting by a UFC fighter in the 90's...Fury should retire, fuckin bitch ass
Robbed
“Dont worrt Francis the checks in the mail”
All bs
The fight look so fake
No way Fury should've won that fight dude even threw an elbow that's instant disqualification!
And New !!!
Fury should of lost its fix
Terrible highlights
That rematch is worth it
Tyson looked like a overweight bum - straight trash!  You see his fat rolls jiggling all over the ring - Francis is a machine!  This call was BS
No Francis  beat Fury up
I think Tyson fury lost but o well rig the fights as much as possible these days
He ate that elbow “ Cheap Shot “ like it was nothing 😳 he different !!! Much respect
Quality of heavy weight boxing has significantly decreased. From the likes of Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson to now where these boxers are so slow and lack any major combination. Boxing nowadays runs on pure fixing and hype. Hardly there is any boxer who actually knows real boxing.
We all know this is bullshit right. Fury sucks
Francis was ROBBED.
Francis won. Period.
Fury is so out of shape
they cheated that man bruh 🤦🏿‍♂️
If it was boxing bare knuckle Francis would kill Tyson. Tyson can’t even faze him with his shots. And of course it it was a straight up fight Francis would murder him. I think Francis did more damage to Tyson in this match and he should of won
Clown shows.  All fake
Francis got robbed live on TV. Boxing is a joke
I’m so glad to see everyone who said Francis wouldn’t last 6 rounds giving him his flowers haha he put on a way better performance than most expected
What a freaking robbery, call the cops call the FBI the CIA I was seriously some grandtheft ! Tyson should be ashamed for saying oh, yeah, I beat him , and props to Francis, for being such a great sport when he knows he beat him terribly, and we all know what to!🥊
mike tyson would have killed fury in his prime
Bro Ngannou gave a better fight than wilder😭 no but honestly, Ngannou could finish up his career with a couple of boxing fights, he legit looks like a boxer and has crazy power.
Money talks.
Fake
Ngannou was a beast.  Guy definitely has what it takes to do boxing if he wants to.
The baddest men in the world don't box anymore, they fight MMA.
Francis win couldn’t kick started popularity in boxing and his career but boxing Mafia leaders have a big ego.
Once Fury elbowed him, Ngannou should have taken him down and ground and pounded him with elbows until he Fury was out.
High way robbery
I can't believe this fight happened
Wow Francis life has literally been proving people wrong at the highest level over and over, his life story is the definition of what the human spirit is capable of
Was this a sham or legit? Very skeptical after watching the mayweather fights. And if u think those fights are legit….you’re an idiot lol. They atleast sold this one better if it was a sham.
Boxing is rigged, like everything else. Get use to it. You suckers.
Props to Francis.
Threw elbow and all new he was losing
Another still for the Man!!!
They just played with my man blood they did the same thing to deante wilder bro
Tyson fury is trash 🗑️ only reason he won cause they have to much money invested on him vs usyk
Fury lost this fight hands down
I thought Tyson lost
What a fight man. 👏👏
My goodness! Mike Tyson created a monster in Francis Ngannou! 😮
Ngannou  compared to the Paul Brothers.  This is insanely impressive. He isn't fighting a past prime smaller or washed up opponent.  He's literally fighting the champion who is bigger and still held his own.  Plus humble. Guys becoming a legend.
Ngannou was so good. Nothing to be ashamed about.  For me he won.
francis is a beast, just as i thought! anyone who watched him study under the true tyson HW champ knew he had it in him; he took to mike like mike did to cus in a way. there were many moments i saw tonight that serve as excellent flashbacks to a prime mike, which is pretty freakin' awesome.
They robbed ngannou
If I was him I would contest this lost and have them remove a point cause that elbow was definitely intentional
If he did this Tyson fury I think he knocks out all other competitors he’s gonna be something like wilder was before wilder started focusing on actual boxing and was only using his knock out power atleast in the beginning because Francis seems to be an actual student whose interested in the sport without pride, but I think other competitors besides wilder he beats them
I don’t care what anybody will say ,Francis won this fight ,this is robbery
francise won this fight hands down everybody knows it.....🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉great job Mike tyson on training franchise please try to stay with him he needs more training great job francise should have won this one because he knocked down the gypsy king and the gypsy king gave him respect because he knew he deserved to win also what a shame...as long as the public  knows and saw who won that's all that matters and as ryan garcia says in his words THE BELTS DON'T MATTER ANYBODY CAN GET IT I AGREE
Fury’s a sore loser with them elbows. As a pro fighter that’s intentional. Also,  see Fury’s face ? This is only Ngannou’s first exhibition match in the boxing world.
Is this some sort of alternate reality where people just go along with stuff?🤔 Is this real life??  Ngannon put on a clinic and man hanndled Fury.  Ngannon is strong and was doing some methodical Mayweather control boxinig . Cut the BS. It was not even  close. This was TOTALLY ridiculous and rigged= WWE nonsense. Ruins the sport.
How come
Remember what Fury's Dad said about Francis's chances of winning? We know Tyson has no chance against Francis in a rematch even if he is allowed to cheat.
Question, do you think Francis would beat Wilder? I'd love to see that fight, and I really think he'd be favourite. He's a real force in the boxing ring, even if that version of Fury looks out of shape and can't be favourite to win against unbeaten never been hurt Usyk, who's basically the boxing master.
Politics is why people don't respect boxing. I'll stick to UFC
Francis landed more powerful shots and kept pressure, he switched stances to confuse fury and used the left hook to his advantage.. fury never hurt him once and francis ate that 6th rd elbow like a G.. francis won by far
Another Robery before the people’s eyes
This is crazy that Tyson won
Makes you wonder if fury even trained for this match! Or Francis is that good hard to tell.
Damn he fye
Man took a elbow like it nothing that deduction yeah they going to wonder what happen in those wilder fights
Highway robbery!!!!!!!
Tyson fury was out of shape with those love handles
Man I thought the predator won that fight look at his face compare to fury they gave him that win
Francis won
Greatest Robbery in Boxing History!
Greatest Robbery in Boxing History!
tyson Fury cant even belieive he surived great boxing Francis Ngannou
Whoever scored the fight 96-93 should be fired and stripped of scoring fights did they even watch the fight!!!!
This shit was ass !!! Francis shouldve won !!!
He would still lose to Jon jones but great performance by Francis
African never give up since from birth they have been cheated
He humiliated the champion
Fury is a prize fighter no one would of watched the fight if he didn’t flop
Boxing is shit!! What a rip off
Highlights? This was like 3 clips lol
Francis was robbed. He did an amazing job! But of course see what everyone is missing is that in December Fury has a title fight against another white boxer. There’s millions behind this fight. If Fury lost to Francis then it would’ve damaged the upcoming title fight in December. Now I see why people really don’t watch boxing as much.
Gtfo of here thats such bs! That elbow should have disqualified him or atleast had a point knocked off.    Fury got beat and the higher ups wouldn't let that happen.
Tyson fury wouldn't last a round against the fighters of the past.........
Bernard hopskins almost lost everything he loved lastnite
So boxers can throw elbows and nothing happen? Wow, you seem to be able to get away with alot when you got the complexion for the protection
Such a fake fight
Ngannou the peoples champ
Fake fight
Congratulations Fury... you just killed the Hype for Undisputed.  Fool.
Fury vs Wilder = Fury came out looking fresh  Fury vs Ngannou = Fury came out looking like mashed potato   Therefore, Francis hits harder than Wilder. I rest my case  🫳 🎤
This shit sad he clearly loose life crazy man and he elbow him smh
He took Fury's elbow and ate it
People were worried about Ngannou unable to break MMA rules?  Fury Throwing Elbows?!  gawwwddd Daaayumm! lol
Home boy got robbed
Francis started boxing years ago never wanted to be an MMA fighter he wanted to be a boxer he's boxed plenty
Robbery
Ngannou got robbed 😒😒
Plus that punch was set up for an elbow
Francis won that ..
$CRIPTED..  $HOWBUI$INE$$ All these people saying they're proud of Francis, LMAO.
Jon jones. That’s crazy.  Train hard. Francis, train hard.
It's really quiet in here? Where are all the haters who said Furry wins by KO?
Ngannou won this fight!!!
There was no way in a split decision that the judges would go against fury to a ufc fighter and have that embarrass their sport… because you know boxing is corrupt as hell..
He shouldn't have won that
The boxing authorities couldn't stand watching one of the greatest heavyweights go down by an MMA dropout. So, they lied.
We know who won 😂😂😂😂😂 the media is rigged
Naw man bro Frances won that fight they just gave it to Fury 🤦🏾‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️
From nothing to something to something greater, im sure he was always a capable man
Nah tyson is a bitch that elbow was intentional. By that alone francis won hands down.
I gotta watch the fight but it looks like fury got his ass kicked
I actually think Francis Ngannou had the edge in this fight, first two punches and Tyson hit the ground. Tyson was rusty as shit from not being in the ring in awhile, and I think he underestimated Ngannou!
one thing i didn't even put into consideration was that fury usually uses his weight against his opponents.In no way was he gonna bully Ngannou that way. Should've saw that advantage for him in advance i must 😅say
Rigged as fuck Francis won
Ngannou did way more damage and dropped him. And the illegal elbow by Fury. Should have been an L for Fury
Francis won
We have a new fighter in the division.
No way the judge vote for Francis 🤣
Fake competition *(make money in second fight)
Francis got robbed
They forgot to show the 10 piece combo ngannou gave fury
Mike Tyson did good !
That elbow was intentionally done.. Fury couldn't stand being walked down. Francis taking punches from 16oz gloves feels like a pillow, mad respect brother. What an incredible talent!
God Bless You, Francis Ngannou! You are a true warrior among men. I thought for sure it was going to be a lopsided fight with Fury winning but I was wrong. Francis got scary knock out power in them hands. Kudos to both guys.
Smh
Good sportsmanship from both fighters. GG.
What a silly scripted wwe-like event
Lol ngannou is like the hulk
Ngannou should be the champ period, amazing human being and a humble one at that
😂😂😂🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ flop😂😂😂
title not on the line so Fury comes in for a gym workout and gets roughed up
Francis did great… really impressive
Francis was robbed, never let it go to the refs.
Fury won...but props to Francis...People lose sight of the fact that just because you did way better than expected doesn't mean you won..although it was a close fight..
What did we learn…..
Fury didnt take Nnganou serious and it almost cost him. I have no interest in watching Fury box after this fight. Usyk will destroy Fury and Fury knows it. People act like Nnganou is some type of super hero. He just boxed a guy that put in no effort and got an easy paycheck. This fight hurt Furys legacy. No one will look at him the same now. Usyk is the best heavyweight on the planet and Fury proved that with this sloppy fight.
Its bullshit that francis lost. He clearly won tyson threw an illegal elbow thats a point gone for sure francis knocked him down in the 3rd and tyson kept hugging him. He realized francis was going to win an so did the boxing community so they ignored "didnt see" the elbow thats bullshit. If they ran it back in the cage tyson would be done first round guaranteed. Also tyson said he wanted to stand there and trade hits basically and didnt wven try to do that cause he would of been asleep! Francis won plain and simple!
Very impressive. Francis should call out Wilder or Joshua or even usyk. I don't think he's a pushover for anyone. MMA should be proud.
Jeez fury, you dodge Usyk, then throw dirty elbows. Keep working on that legacy bud.
muhammed ali must be turning in his grave with this cheesecake belly dude acting like the heavyweight champ
Ngannou should seek a rematch and as part of his training: practice the fuck out of body shots. With his power he can be effective on any part of the body. Tyson Fury is athletic despite his size. Head shots are good and quick but a champion will not give his head easy but the body can't hide.
Robbery.
Jake Paul vs Francis. Lets make this happen!
The Saudi Arabia Screw Job
Francis's boxing looked absolutely horrible but it was so bad that it seemed to be hard for Tyson to figure out. They say the hardest fight for a technical boxer is a brawler and vice versa.
What a rigged shit show.
One word, rigged. Lol
Robbery
Francis really won that fight
Man hit the floor and thanked the gods he was still conscious and not out cold bc that would’ve been devastating
This had to be staged
boxing is such bullshit
A UFC fighter took the heavyweight champ to a split decision in his first boxing match ever even knocked him down ngannou will win a rematch
I call Shenanigans!!!!!!!
Fury is a dirt bad for that cheap elbow. that was on purpose.
Judges were real judgemental on this fight 🙄
Man, So proud of Ngannou!
They couldn't let a UFC guy win
What nowbody is mentioning is the fact mike Tyson taught him so dam well
He wont fight Usyk for sure now.
I expected Francis to be competitive, but no way did i except this. You can easily make the argument that he won which is pretty incredible since it's his first pro boxing match against the undefeated champ. I think he won. He's a natural boxer.
Dang Francis won that ome
Wow!!!...to me, Francis WON that fight dispite the judges decision... #politics
“He’S aBiG fAT sAsuAgE” 😵‍💫
I’m surprised Fury didn’t have points taken off on that elbow. Francis did great!!
He was robbed
No boxer will go into mma and do this to a mma champion.
Noone lost..1st time boxer with a near win against a world champ plug big pay days for each.
The biggest boxing robbery I ever witnessed!!
Glad I didn’t pay for this
Francis has earned my respect. I thought he had no chance. My man can box. Love it. Rematch.
That elbow was dirty!!😠😡
Finally a guy who made a switch and actually impressed.
I gave Fury the edge by one or two rounds but as a hardcore UFC fan Francis shocked me! His skills, fight IQ, and activity was far better then what it was in MMA. This dude should’ve been boxing this whole time and despite that he was still the UFC champ.
I’d be very interested to hear a post fight breakdown by Max Kellerman & Stephen A. A knockdown, taking an elbow and staying aggressive most of the fight I’m not sure how Fury won.
This fight was set up to go 10 rounds, no belt was on the line. Is was a fight for fury to shake his ring rust and get some rounds in, get a big check and promote the upcoming fight with usyk in the new stadium in Saudi. That's it is was a scripted show
ROBBERY
Tyson did NOT win
Franics is the The baddest man on the planet and the heavyweight champion
What a crock of shit decision, another embarrassment to boxing.
Tyson was oddly inactive.  Perhaps Ngannau's power/skill was more than he prepared for but he's typically pumping his jab and today he just wasn't.
I’ve noticed a pattern. When the black fighters lose every black person on twitter tweets how they were robbed.
Total bullshit. Just like when Jake Paul knocked down Fury and lost.
Tyson Fury looked horrible. Off balance, sloppy, dirty. Francis is the Heavyweight King tonight
Francis won big time! Beat Dana  lol
Usyk beat this joke of a man. Ive been saying Furys overrated and this proves it
..im sorry, but dont kiss..hug..n definitely dont rub the top of my head..after trying to thow str8 elbows at me instead of punches, str8 cheating...then you wann kiss n hug🤬
Tyson: "I'm bullet proof!! These are bombs!!" 😳
Francis won
Francis very impressive gave him a run for his money.  You would've had to kill Tyson in order to win since you just started boxing. 😂
Bro this DUDE stand toe toe with a Heavyweight WORLD CHAMP and didn’t get knocked out. And the fight wasn’t one sided. Some moments I thought Fury was gonna get knocked. Cheers to fury tho!
Francis was ROBBED  wow. A mma fighter 1 professional fight just beat the heavyweight champion
its funny the guy says he catches him of guard to not make tyson look bad when tyson was going in for the punch😂😂
He threw an elbow?! Francis knocked him down
Robbery 🤦🏾‍♂️
Come on, man. How did tyson win this fight? How
I think it’s good in disguise that Francis lost. As people saw he got robbed his fan following increased definitely
Francis: "Oh, elbows,?? We eat those!" 😳
I love Tyson Fury. But he lost.
Rigged Fury a dirty fighter also
😂😂😂
I think its hilarious Fury thinks he could beat JBJ especially after this performance lol imagine if this was mma when francis knocked him down... would have murdered him with ground and pound
Legal robbery in Saudi Arabia smh
Rocky story in real life Great Fight
Francis arguably looks better and more natural moving around than wilder
Francis did so well from this fight alone he would beat many and I’m say many heavyweight fighters now with that skill he knocked down the king of boxing
Yo who tf can beat that big mfr lol i need Shaquille Oneal to step in the ring😂
Francis striking looked more disciplined in boxing than it did in MMA.
Robbery smh
He elbow him come on now
Fury lost boxing always has made wrong decision the truth ufc guy won.
Tyson Fury was cheating, hitting with back hand and throwing elbows.
This guy said he’d win in the octagon😂😂😭 won via robbery in his own sport
Francis kinda reminds me of Holyfield
Damm he won and am a hater 😂
What a robbery.
Bullshit call
Ngannou ate a clean hard dirty elbow from Fury like it was nothing. Insane.
Robbbbeddddddd
Sad day for boxing. Even as a Fury fan. That was a Ngannou victory. Not sure what fight the judges were watching….
Why did he read the scorecards and call him the champion in that weak ass voice? it's supposed to be AND STIIIIIILLL
Damn just think of what this does for Mike Tyson as a trainer!!!! Yell
Francis is the real life Rocky. Sorry Chuck Wepner.
The Plan was never to give Ngannou the Win.  This fight was just for Money and Hype. It was for pure Entertainment...
Francis = robbed
Francis' seriously a legend.
Tyson Fury Is A Dirty Bastard For Elbowing That Man , He Thought That Would Losen him Up So he Could Get A Knockout😂😂😂 Not Tonight Baby
Ngannou did a hell of a job 👍🏼👌🏼 real life rocky 1 ( again)
My friend was a boxing judge in small events all over for YEARS, and he was flabbergasted at how fury won this fight. He was on the back foot for way more than half the fight AND got knocked down. Should’ve been a draw at the LEAST.
I’m forever a fan of Ngannou after this fight. It should have gone in favor of Ngannou. Regardless he is now a respected boxer.
the difference between a fighter and a boxer is obvious
Name a fighter to get knocked down and still win that was black fighting a white/meixcan dude... RUN IT BACK cheating asses
He’s afraid to fight Jones and lost to Fury.
Bullshit
That’s so fake! Come on man! Really!
He didn’t do anything Mike Tyson taught him smh
Sold fight
One Point....YIKES
Bull shit
This is your king?
Boxing is a fake sport
Francis was robbed
Fury is a sad sack, lousy form, lousy talk, sloppy, no footwork, a-hole.
Francis is the winner! Dirty fury
The judge at :30 tyson come on now im gonna have to rigg my scorecard terrible!
Rigged.
He'd knock wilder out
Francis won that shit
Bro Ngannou was robbed
Fixed outcome lke i expected, Just like the wilder fight.
Meh. I thought the black guy did better. Good fight though and close either way. Also that elbow sucked but it was an accident. I used to box, shit like that happens
Ngannou had that fight all day long.
Wow make that decision make sense? Total monarchy BS as to be expected for a social media based event. God forbid fury gets embarrassed with all the white wigs watching. Smh
Give Francis alot of credit he dropped fury
I thought Francis did enough..although I'm an mma guy so maybe a bit biast
Tyson won 10 out of 12, minus the knockdown. Stupid fight. Stfu haters.
Round 7 was a second knockdown for Ngannou 😕
TO ME, THE FIGHT DIDNT MATTER TO ME, IT WAS FRANCIS’ STORY TO GET THERE IS WHAT MATTERS🫡 HE WON THE FIGHT! WIN OR LOSE.
I’m impressed how he went toe to toe with one of the greatest heavy weight today
They still trying to save this cocaine boy😂😂😂 this was a robbery
I bet Dana Pink is red in the face 😡
Francis did way better than I expected I thought he was gonna lose easy but he proved me wrong and went the distance respect.The Gypsy King is still my favorite fighter ever
Robbery
Round one tyson  Two  francis  there the uppercut dazed him on hugging proves my point   Round three 10 8 francis   Round four francis   Round five tyson   Round six neck crank/elbow  by tyson wtf sport is this but tyson round if refs were calling clean fight minus one point two fouls one round 9-9  Round seven - tyson falls/slips due to francis strength draw  Round 8 francis  Round nine tyson   Round ten tyson 94 tyson 95 ngannou
Everyone saying Francis did good for his first real boxing match. Just imagine if Fury went in to a MMA fight with the heavyweight champion and lost by 1 point. Francis did AMAZING!
I think Francis won honestly
just go to show you Tyson Fury a straight bum😂😂😂
This is the guy who said he’d beat Jones if they were locked in a room together😂😂😂😂
I thought FN won.
Fury embarrassed his sport tonight
Why is a 37 year old even debuting a boxing career lol
No way is fury brave enough to step into a cage with Francis now
Glad I didn't pay for it😂😂😂 Tyson Fury the worst heavyweight in the history of boxing
That’s the last man Mr.Fury wants to be trading elbows with
Remember the “embarrassing” pre fight warm ups of Ngannou?  He was putting on.  We mma fans knew he was putting on and acting slow and stiff.  He’s always had that left counter to an opponents big right cross.  And, thats how he caught Fury.  Unlike most mma fighters like McGregor, Woodley, Diaz(no power)Francis has every punch ( a left hook, straight, uppercut and all powerful).  Francis has never been stunned or hurt by a punch either.  So, he has incredible chin.  Fury did land many right crosses and he ate em.  He’s a physical specimen and incredible human being if you read his story.  Glad he finally got his payday that mma could never give him and he knows damn well he beat the heavyweight champ…he can take that with him forever.
Esos robos ni en México se ven 💔🤣
Tyson fury should now stop calling himself one of the greatest. This is a Shane to boxing
Boxing fan: "See, I told you my guy was gonna smoke him!(Francis knockdown, and close fight)... Whatever, it's totally rigged anyway"  Lol boxing fans are so bitter right now that Fury just got his ass kicked my an MMA fighter. What salty little babies 😂
Francis should just stay in boxing and get more of that 🤑
93-96 to Fury 🤔, ...someone explain that please
😮 I don't think they went all the way, maybe it's just because ufc and boxing is turning into WWE, yeah it sucked
Shame for Furry, who's even surprised to be the winner. Francis Ngannou is the real champion 🏆 🥇 🏅
Ngannou probably made more in this one boxing match than all of his MMA fights from small promotion to UFC combined. That's the important victory.
The Boxing gods could not let Fury lose going into a fight with Usyk. All this fight did was cement a rematch if Fury wins against Usyk. Imo
No MMA fighter will ever get a fair judgement in boxing.
It’s time for Tyson to hang the gloves up. Soon as a decent competitor steps up that can match the landed jabs, he’s done.
A black man cannnever fight in a white man home town
What a joke. Francis robbed.
tyson fury think he ksi with that elbow 😭
Ngannou was about to shock the world fury by  S/D is sad🤦🏾‍♂️
I need the rematch! I wanna see ngannou again
It was a close fight but fury definitely won! Respect to ngannou for giving the champ hell! Big respect
Wow
Robbery
Proud of Francis I really doubted him.. I take all of that back. He did a great job.
Andy Ruiz would beat the heck out of Tyson . I want that fight next. Great job to Francis I feel like you won man.
Tyson fury lost
Fury always gets knocked down. Fury took him light.😂😂😂😂 😂😂😂 Francis better get paid during a rematch 😂😂
Fury is trash wtf is happing to boxing
Damn they just scewed Francis wow. Even with am elbow to the face and he still stood tall. Francis won that fight
wait did espn even watch this fuckin shit?! how the fuck did he lose?!
Frances won the fight, the judges were not fair.
Fury didnt deserve the win
When the winner was announced, everyone started looking around and clapping awkwardly
Honestly this was a huge moral victory for Francis. I have so much respect for him and I really hope he comes back to the UFC and fights Jon jones cause imagine if he’s the one to beat him???
How
THATS CRAZY FOO......WTF WHO TF
Tyson didn't really believe it but he had to save face 🙄
Ngannou is a dawg man looked like top 5 heavy weight tonigjt in his first fight crazy lol
These are some good actors!
The biggest load of bullshit
Francis was beat by the sport of boxing, not a boxer.
The money man’s said this had to be done nagannu. This must be done. But everyone know you win. The whole world know.  The intro to a beloved king
now lets see the same fight with MMA rules and MMA gloves
Tyson looked like he didn’t even train for this fight , better not see anymore of these performances
I seen the look on fury face he so forced his movement he clearly knew he lost that fight just saying
Fury did not win this fight. He got knockdown and if the ref wudv seen that on purpose elbow he definitely wudv took a point from tyson.
Ngannou basically was Rocky. Comes in, shocks everybody, leaves a winner even in defeat!
Francis got robbed by the senile biased judges that don’t wanna except the new things to come, which is cross over boxing, and influencer boxing
Suilaman's face when the first judges card for Ngannou was read says it all. Boxing needs a union and AI judging technology.
Tyson Fury tried and elbow and he's just a dirty bastard he's a really dirty boxer
Damn so the top HW in boxing lost to a UFC guy in boxing? Wow
Ain’t no way boy
Nganno is the winner
Idc wat nobody says that elbow was dirty asf ain’t no way this man keeps getting away w dirty moves and no one holds him accountable
I have to give it to mike Tyson for prepping Francis to go the distance.
Wow great job Francis!
Ngannou won that fight 🤷🏻‍♂️ but 💰talks and they’re not gonna let the gypsy king lose to a prospect
Tyson Fury is their white hope. he cheats in every fight
Ngl i was proven was Francis is insane
I think Ngannou won. Fury missed a lot, the punches he didn't were either blocked or didn't do a lot of damage in comparison to Ngannou's. That's just facts.
Look how fat Fury is.  Al Bundy was in better shape.  Looks like he just got off the couch looking for the remote.
Fury gotta be embarrassed. He’s the undefeated, undisputed, lineal Heavyweight champ of the world and he almost got beat by an MMA fighter in his first ever pro boxing match . He’s a Gypsy too though …. Makes me wonder 🤔🤔🤔
Francis one this shit rigged fuck boxing!!!!
And the story of ROCKY WAS BORN!!!!! FUTURE CHAMP!
Remember when Connor fought floyd, and everyone dissed on connor for no reason but Francis gets all this praise?  Yeah, fuck that.
The furys are rigging fights left and right ffs
🚮 fight  Fury took his best shot and Still had no respect for him .. Francis is not that good . Not at all.. rematch if fury took him serious it would be a k.o in favor of gypsy king 👑
Fury is and has always been a fraudulent over-rated PED cheat, drug addict, glove cheat , fake Christian,  paper champion in the weakest era in heavyweight history. Media and match making hyoe job. He couldn't beat Otto Wallin. He said he could drink 25 pints of beer and beat Ngannou. Apparently not. He lost a showcase fight to a one fight novice. Usyk beats him easy a blown up cruiserweight. Respect to Francis but he gets stopped by Zhang, Hrgovic, AJ, and the big Russian that was on the undercard.
Stolen fight
Robbery
Who gaf. He made 10 million. To me, that's a W!
Bullshit 😜
Usyk might just beat fury
Reeeemmmmmaaccch!!!!!!!
Wanna only show ONE highlight from Francis?? ESPN really? Not only was this a one sided fight clearly, but don’t even wanna show credit when it’s due but ain’t that how it always goes for the brutha??
Put Francis against fury in a boxing match it’s a split decision put fury against Francis in a mma match and fury is out in 10 seconds
Francis Ngannou = Rocky Balboa
That's why boxing is now a spectacle like wrestling. 😢
Assuming that elbow wasn’t legal lol
Boxing is business now. That punch was weak.
I’ve never seen a more fat athletic man in my life 😂
Two fury brothers winning two rigged fights within a month is so funny to me 😂
Good thing boxing isn’t real fighting,, if that would’ve been a real fight fury would be sleep on the ground with his teeth missing💀
Tyson fury souled out hes trash
The two difference faces at the end tells you who really won. Francis made Tyson look so bad.
Fury way have won on the cards BUT Ngannou won that fight if you know what I mean
This is why boxing is dying, especially at the heavyweight division. A mma fighter can waltz in against arguably the best heavyweight in the world and bring it to a controversial split decision. This is why I never bought into the fury hype, Francis just made a majority of the “boxers” on fury’s record look like amateurs. Easy to look great against nobodies. Look at the 60s and 70s, just to be in the conversation you had to compete against foreman, Holmes, Norton, Liston, Frazier and Ali. In the 80s and 90s you had Holyfield, tyson, Bowe, foreman again and Lewis. Who is there now than can even be put in the same conversation as any of those guys?
No no good points
You people kill me. You all know damn good and well Fury was going to win this fight. It's all an exhibition, and no boxing champion is going to lose to someone outside his disciple/sport to ensure the integrity of the title in the sport. The Boxing Commision will not let it happen anyway. Hell...he has another big, REAL boxing fight coming up in the near future.  You fools spent an exorbate amount of money for tickets and ppv for this fuckin garbage. The knockdown was BS....wasnt even a real punch....all show to keep it interesting. I swear....you people are fools watching this garbage. Dumbasses.
Fury lost this fight
Imagine if Tyson took over as trainer for Ngannou. I don't think it would take two years to win a championship
How tf fury still win? 🤦🏾‍♂️
If you leave it up to the judges, they will always back the favorite!
Fury kinda lost this one it’s all good tho great fight from both these guys
I think Fury just had trouble getting his coke into Saudi Arabia. He seemed uninterested.
😅😅😅
Modern boxing is pretty shit. No one cares about a concert with shitty auto tune rappers, 20 minute walk outs, one hour transition period from the co-main to main, dollar store Bruce Buffer, lame ass scoring criteria, and padded “undefeated” records. Boxingtards stay loosing
You should be ashamed of yourself a man with no barking experience took you to school so much for a heavyweight champ I would like to see a rematch he would knock you out
For being so huge, powerful & athletic, i'm not impressed. Ngannou shoulda smashed. Fury is one tough dude.
He totally lost
Fury you lost that fight
That was it?
Tyson was hitting with his elbow he a cheater
I'm so sorry to bring it up but it's just so fun, I can't imagine living in alis time, these guys are so slow it makes you realize how amazing ali was as a heavyweight. So amazing. For anyone who hasn't YouTube Muhammad Ali amazing speed and just watch and then rewatch this fight.
Damn after rewatching the fight. Francis got screwed 😂
Big Francis got hands
Bulshit judges assholes
The gypsy kong got dropped and won no way , the other guy got robbed
This gave me real lifre ocky vibes lol
Francis got robbed!!
Fury didn't even train properly for this fight,boring fight.
Bones???!!!!! number 1 remember that
Francis > fury clearly the agressor more power punches and a knockdown... We ALL KNOW WHO WON THAT FIGHT
Looks like Ngannou got cheated...😒
Dirty elbow...deliberate
He was punching on Fury wow I wasn’t expecting that he won that fight smh
Boxing is rigged.  If they let Ngannou win the decision against the heavyweight champ it would have been the death of boxing so they had to steal it from him
Francis won fuck that and that elbow should’ve been  loss of points
Robbery
All respect to Francis
Ngannou didnt even blink w the elbow. Hes like "what? Thats not legal? Oh ok"
Props to Ngannou, giving Fury an even-matched fight like that. Not how I thought the fight would go down. Ngannou is a Legendary Fighter!!!
Ngannou has hands
Boxing fans, I know you're confused as hell rn and for good reason, but this kind of crazy shit happens every month in mma. Welcome to our world
Whoever gave 96-93 should quit their job and go back to how to score boxing classes
I dont care what anyone says if a mf can go the distance in his very 1st bout with the supposed champ shows how weak the heavy class is. If a real boxer come off the street they could be champ if somebody gave him a shot off rip
What a robbery tbh some one needs to get sued bro. How can they just do Francis like that. Tyson and his game if they have dignity. They can’t say Tyson won that.
For anyone who doesnt feek kike watching Francis won
Congratulations Francis. On everything, inside and outside of that ring. Keep proving them wrong.
Robbery
Tyson fury lost point blank
still lost
Image what Francis would do to him in the cage
This guy always gets up
You gotta be fckn kidding me.
Mike Tyson was right Fury should of been more focused this is crazy your the Champ and damn near lost to a beginner 😂😂😂
Dana is very grumpy right now
Dana White punchin air rn 😭😭😭
I'm a fan of fury but he did not win that fight
complete robbery, I bet on Tyson Fury and he did not win that fight. I think Tyson won 3 rounds max and that's honestly being too generous. When I kept track of it live I had it Francis 98-92.
Bullshit. Francis never went down.
No way Tyson fury won!!!!! Mike Tyson skills shows on brotha
The jury has deprived Francis from his victory, wherever there is a black there is fear, rubbish, I don’t think fury is watching the match, the number of times he felt down rubbish, Nganou❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉 congratulations
Somewhere. Jon Jones is wishing😂
Wow Francis look so good
Anyone that paid the $80 for that should ask for a refund.  Not Francis's fault either.  He did as well as you might expect particularly after taking that elbow.  My question is did Tyson Fury even train for this fight?  He looked awful.
This fight proves what I was saying forever. FURYY IS OVERRATED!!! he struggled with wilder who’s not even that skilled and now gets exposed by Francis who’s predominantly a mma fighter!!!
Nganou won for real
BS decision..and that cheap elbow shot 🙄
From what i saw, Ngannou did better against Fury than Wilder did🤷🏾‍♂️
These highlights are way too short to actually know what happened in the fight. I would not have thought Fury won based on this little clip.
Damn Fury Didn’t Know where he was 😭
Boxing sucks dick. That is all.
Damn dude can bcox and ko the other dude lol, good job!
Fury is trash 😂
Smh
0:54  Fkn cheap shot. That could of been seriously damaging. Tyson should of been disqualified after that
Francis took tyson punches and elbow for lunch and also in a mma match tyson would get destroyed
Great job by Francis! 🥊
Wow
Francis won
The first knockdown looked so fake. Fury even had a chance to look at the floor and make sure he'd fall down safely.
Fury sandbagged like a mf. Don’t believe the hype. Let him fight any other boxer and he gets waxed.
That elbow was crazy
Am i the only one who thinks NGannou won this fight by a landslide? Or am i just blind?
Wow
Somebody edited the Wikipedia page for this fight with: "Fury won the fight by bribing the judges." LMAO
Judge that scored it 96-93 Fury should be ashamed of himself
$1000 on Usyk!!!
I got into plenty of arguments with people saying Fury would school Ngannou. I grew up watching, and doing some boxing myself. Is not that Fury is a true boxer vs a powerful puncher, what people failed to realize is that this is not a sanctioned fight and also the fact Tyson would not take him seriously. It showed because of his worse than usual shape. He was clearly gassed and didn't take the punching power seriously. Just like Mayweather caught some hard punches by Connor, but at least he destroyed  Connor at the end, unlike Fury, who looked...well, bad.
Robbery
Mike Tyson trained a beast in Francis Ngannou. Cus would be proud of him. He needs to train more fighters and continue passing down the D’Amato style of boxing.
Francis won that fight. He did it right. He stepped in on Fury and did not fight long-range like the others.   Andy Ruiz could destroy Fury because he is a tremendous inside fighter. He would neutralize Furys' power like Francis did.
This is why people believe boxing is rigged.
Politics!
Boxing isBS.  Honk.  Honk.
Ngannou vs Wilder now
Francis got robbed idk how you can five it to Tyson Fury in anyway he got rocked 3 times and got knocked down I bet money on this too such bull 💩 is boxing when it comes to judging
Francis vs Wilder could be a good fight
So 2 judges gave Francis and that one judges 96-93 to tyson gave him the decision win. Damn
Alll the people hating on Ngannou are looking really foolish for right now. (The man’s overcome adversity you couldn’t even dream of.)
Now Fury and his weak legs need to go into  MMA
Fury da Hutt doesn't stand a chance against Usyk. He better cherish that belt while he still has it.
If you thought that was rigged for fury to win your about stupid
I knew this fight was gonna be close. Tyson trained him and has all of his knowledge plus cus’s knowledge. If they rematched in a year Francis is takin him out!!
Francis would destroy Johnny boy in a boxing match or otherwise!!!
francis vs deontay!!! I need to see that
If Tyson Fury would have lost I would have lost so many nickels and dimes
Someone got cheated dam
Did Tyson lose a point for the elbow? Looked pretty intentional to me. Could’ve been the difference in the fight.
Love boxing. Hate the politics. Fury is great because of his opponents. UFC lost a major draw in Ngannou. Fury's face after Wilder vs after Ngannou
I won't pretend that I know much of Ngannou, but all I've heard from various media leading up to the fight is that he would get "DESTROYED BY FURY". Yet another reminder that outcomes aren't won on paper. Congrats on a great showing Francis 👏.
0:54 it was an accident
Robbery francis shouldve won
Tyson should be ashamed to be built like that and a pro athlete. I don’t care about body shaming or none of that, but the fact that he looks like a sack of potatoes shows he doesn’t take it seriously. He could be twice as dominant if he did.
Don't forget: In a real fight, Francis would DESTROY FURY
the judges gave tyson the win because it would've been hard to sell that next undisputed fight he got coming up in December
I would've thought Ngannou would get the split given the knockdown. This was a real fight, not like the Paul circus. Respect to Francis and MMA guys crossing over.
Hold up something ain't
How he lost and he dropped him ?
Come on Man!!! Really? Rematch!! 😅
Should be automatic Rematch with that elbow throw.
If fury does a mma fight with this brother he is going to get destroyed.
I’m so proud of ngannou tonight….   No one gave him a shot, and he arguably beat the best boxer in the world. He has absolutely nothing to be ashamed of…  Edit: comments reek of salt. Cope harder
Camera man don’t know how to do it know good  distance very bad
Francis clearly woop fury's ass
Robbery
When he knocked his ass down, Fury realized he wasn't playing with Deontae Wilders punching power anymore. That man Ngannou didn't even get a full load on that left and you could see how much it surprised Fury. He has the most insanely heavy punches. Even when he doesn't get to put it all behind them, it's still such a powerful punch. If he can load up his punches, I don't think there is a human on this planet today, or ever in history, that could just eat it and not be getting woken up by the doctors afterwards.
Mad respect to Francis as a sportsman. He did  amazing, hell of a knockdown. IMO, Fury deserved the split decision win as he land d more punches and outboxed Francis, but still what an amazing performance from Francis.
A few more upper cuts and a few more combination punches with the right and this fight definitely could have went the other way for Francis
Francis won
MMA has pretty much evolved into 90% stand up, they train in boxing.
Francis beeds to enter boxing full time! Tough and skilld
That elbow was nothing to Francis he gets that all the time in the ufc
Francis just lost a SPLIT decision to the current Heavy weight WBC world champion in his boxing debut. Let that sink in for a minute. What Francis did tonight was nothing less the spectacular and proves that he is a freak of nature. His movement his ability to cut the ring off his shots. It literally leaves me speechless. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Nice short punches by Francis. He should work his way up in boxing.
clear blatant elbow.
Pay them no mind, I say, as we know you won.
Tyson never faced a stromg same weight fighter like francis
Big bigups to T fury for giving Ngannou that platform ,they both won the night
Fury didn't even train for this fight,he didn't think Francis would be any good and boy was he surprised
Well with that call 9n that fight it was this night everyone lost respect for a fair called boxing match
That Elbow though !
Love Francis. A great man and a great fighter! Kudos to both
Francis won even with the illegal elbow and clinching from Fury.
Two great fighters. They deserve a rematch, possibly a trilogy bout.
Robbed
He cheated.  He elbowed Francis and the ref didn’t see it. Hmm my boy Francis won the match. Case closed!!!!
hmmmm...and Tyson Fury threw an elbow too...
THIS IS YOUR BOXING KING????? LMAO
If he wasn’t a known heavyweight champion before the fight and wasn’t favored going in he would have lost that fight, Francis got cheated
Robbery to protect boxing
Bro this is a wicked world we live in Tyson did nothing to Francis nothing he was the aggressor and he dropped Tyson also landed the clean heavy hits never backed down from Fury at all
Fury in the mma would've have hammer fist to the face and have the referee stop the fight
😂😂😂😂😂 Tyson playin with him
Mother fucker he beat him wtf was that about
Fury is a filthy cheater and a lousy fighter blessed with the thickest skull (and nothing in it to protect).  Way to go on Ngannou, excellent performance especially considering the transition.   Split decision reeks of favoritism, gaps in points made no sense.
That was Francis 100%!
Francis robbed by referree.
Boxing is rigged!
Fury should be embarrassed!
How does the number 1 ranked Heavy weight boxer in the world, get dropped by someone that has never even Boxed before in his life, and almost lost?  Tyson Fury is an embarrassment to himself as well as the BOXING profession .
So basically Francis was robbed of this fight but nobody's talking about it. Francis was robbed and nobody seems to care about this, everybody seems to be cool with Tyson Fury getting the robbery victory over Francis. I wonder why that is?
That was fake fall bro come on 😂😂😂
Always these crooked judges omg
Give this man a secondary WBA title fight
NGANNOU WILL DESTROY TYSON IN REMATCH !!!
Mike Tyson just became the main trainer for MMA crossovers!!!
Giggle giggle go the love handles of Fury
NGANNOU ROBBED BY A SLOPPY FAT CHUMP !!!
Everyone underestimated Francis. Incredibly impressive showing. What a boss.
Notice it was a 10 round fight and ESPN just showed us a two minute highlight lol if you watch the whole fight you know what happened
Wtf
Great fight
He lost . Thats some BS
I went from wanting Tyson Fury to win, betting on him to how the fuck did he win.
FUry Lost Lmfao
I wonder if Tyson could have survived an elbow from Francis in return?
Wow another robbery in boxing! Lol not surprised, the announcer sounds like he’s reading funeral remarks. Lmao
Tyson lost this fight, but nothing in boxing surprises me anymore.
MUCH RESPECT FRANCIS!
If you see the elbow hit he should of lost due to point deduction. That's bull shit we all seen it pathetic. Fury is getting knocked out next fight and won't get up watch. Out assed out dirty ass fighter. He got a gift when he fought the brown bomber he got 13 second count or more to get up. Coward ass referees doing stupid shit
😂 ridiculous.  The only way Francis would of won . If he'd knocked him out. They wasn't going to let a amateur/ new comer  boxer beat a known champ. The heavyweight boxing is a real joke.
Tyson done Francis a SOLID FOR REAL SALUTE
Nagnou...soooo jacked on steroids.
Fury throwing elbowes
White people cheated again 😂
I’m sure fury broke a bone
This proves Fury isn’t that good…he will lose to Usyk. Fury has been knocked down 7 times in his career…7 times!
Imagine if wilder would have gone and asked Mike like he should have smh
BULLSH!T !!!!....At least he got paid.
And this is how we know boxing is rigged and why people don’t like it. How did a man with a knockdown lose to a guy who didn’t knock him down? Makes zero sense. Shit it so rigged it’s ridiculous
Cheating the black man yet again….
Francis lost but he proved he’s the baddest man on the planet.
Francis got robbed
Tyson ass be cheating bruh
Im soo proud of Francis!!!! I honestly thought this fight would be embarrassing for him. I thought for sure he would get out classed and gassed but i really wanted him to do great.... and boy did he!!! Im so proud of him and cant wait to see what he does next!!! Love you Ngannou
Straight cheating , Tyson did not win that fight
Wtf how tf did fury win
Now can we see an mma match now ?
Go sell your soul to the saudis
Fake fight ! Come on , it is fucking play
Fury is going out that easy he's a real warrior like him or not that man can fight
fuey sucks lmao nganou won he knocked his ass down. I get it they didnt wanns have him lose his belt but dam atleast make it less obvious 😅😂😂😂
Not judging anyone but repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. The Lord Jesus died and was resurrected on the third day for us so that we might have eternal life through believing in him and obedience to him and the word. Accept the lord Jesus as your savior today if you haven’t already have a blessed day. The Lord Jesus is coming back soon be ready 🤍🤍🧡🤍
Fury chunky chunky
NGAUNO MY CHAMP! ALL I WANTED WAS FOR HIM TO KNOCK THE TECHNO DANCER GYPSY...NOT NOBKING IN MY EYE'S. HE KNOWS HE DIDN'T WIN THAT FIGHT. HE TJINKS HES YOUNG DANCING TO THAT STUPID ASS TECHNO MUSIC...MIKE TYSON SALUTE TO HIM...  CARLITOS ☆BOSTON
FRANCIS WON
Anyone else notice that elbow lol
Robbed
This is why boxing is dead...........fights rigged Francis won the fight............ They could not let Fury lose and mess up the money for the Usyk fight  At the end of the day the bureacrat's and money people decide who wins and loses.............not the fighters
Francis won
Feels like the other guy got robbed
Good Job to UFC for losing the best HW in the world.  He clowned your company and instead of taking 8 million for three fight deal, he got 10 million for one boxing fight which will lead him to way bigger pay days.  Ngannou gambled on himself and won.  Congrats.  Fury did win slightly on my score card, but he did 10000x better than McGregor.
Ngannou, looked better, than the top three Heavyweights. Hats off. Would love to see him come over to Boxing. One badass dude.
Francis won for sure
Please,  Francis got robbed.  Boxing fans ought to be ashamed.
Split decision to an mma fighter? Usyk gonna retire greedy belly for real this time.
Ngannou is the winner he dominated all around.
Bullshit
Told yall he would win.People hated on me for saying fury would lose,But I was right.Judges are corrupt.Jokes on boxing tho!
Francis won but he needs to improve his head movement ❤
What the fuck.
It looked like Francis might of won,  today's boxers are a joke, they can't even compare to throwback fighters, the fact that an MMA guy can come in and compete at a high level with a "champion " shows that boxing has been watered-down badly, this sport is pathetic

Fury smokes crack if he thinks he can fight MMA
So….Francis won🤣
Wow! Never in a million years did i think Francis would have a chance let alone put up a performance like he did, I'm def more of an MMA guy but I will say tho that was NOT a robbery, There's a difference between a robbery and a close fight. I can see both fighters edging it out, Overall Francis absolutely blew my expectations out of the water with this fight tho, So even if Fury got the judges nod, This night def belongs to Francis.
A ufc fighter getting a split decision loss against a heavy great is an amazing accomplishment. Especially with the highlights he generated much respect to that man
Bullshit!!!
Francis is a beast he represented mma well
Looks like a robbery, you don't have a swollen eye, spots all over your face and get knocked down and win.  Then fury should have lost points for the elbow.  I feel bad for Francis.  He did amazing
He got robbed
Everybody crying about the decision. Fran man scored a knock down. Fury controlled the fight the rest of the way. I bet Fury barley trained .
Respect
I don't know what fight the judges were watching, Francis clearly won, fury never even hurt him, and Francis scored a knockout
Big white fat man kissing Nga knowing he lost
Now let’s have a rematch in the octagon.
Made Fury look silly.
I sure hope Francis keeps fighting. I think he should have won but it is what it is.
Francis has shocked the world.  Someone go check on Dana White
Boring fight! Big props for Francis for getting in the ring with a sloppy boxer.
That elbow was nasty. Did fury get a point deducted for that?
Here comes the money train for francis!!! Choo choo 🚂
Wat a robbery
Francis got robbed ….
Fury lost !
Ngannou got robbed.
Judges got this decision wrong!! Ngannou won this fight! Fury knows who won
Can you imagine a MMA fight lol!!! It was all set up for a rematch that fury will lose!!! He will get his paycheck and retire
And New Heavyweight Champion of the World.... Francis "The Gypsy Killer" Ngannouuu ☀️🌍💪🏾
Ngannou won it all tonight
96-93? What was that judge watching?
Maybe Tyson should train for his next fight, you think?
Highlights lasted 2 seconds glad I didn’t pay for this
King Francis
well they only showed us less than 20 seconds of actual action so its impossible to say how either performed, thANKS FOR THE 20 SECONDS I GUESS
Tyson blaitantly cheated with that elbow. Francis won. That was amazing and I hope Tyson gives him another shot bc Francis will for sure have hia number without fail. Incredible young man and look at how beat up Tyson looks! But... I am grateful that he gave Francis this life altering fight! I see Francia sticking to this sport and shining!
Couple points that are being overlooked: 1. The face test- ngannou unscratched, Fury banged up. 2. Stamina - Ngannou went 10 rounds in his FIRST PRO FIGHT against the lineal champ. AMAZING.
How did fury win?? Lol 😂
U see the racism in this sport. Unbelievable ! BS
Francis was robbed.
BS!!
If that was the highlights this fight must have sucked
Dana white he was never my friend swinging in the air right now the only mma crossover to boxing that actually beat the best boxer of the world in his own game where all the douters nos
1 point Split Decison! Incredible debut by Francis!
Rematch anyone
96-93 furry that’s insane. Fire this judge
Good to see a lot of people commending Francis. Even boxing/Fury fans are unanimously conceding they felt Francis won.   Personally, I'm the opposite. I'm an MMA fan to the core - don't watch much boxing aside from major fights and of course the MMA crossover spectacles. I went into this rooting for Francis, but strongly suspecting Fury would win.  I knew Francis had the power to get his respect, but didn't think the technical discrepancy would allow him to make it happen.  First off, I was utterly shocked at how well Francis fought. On a technical level, I actually think he's a better boxer than Wilder. I always compared him to Wilder in terms of what he would bring to professional boxing; a power hitter who can beat top competitors even with a technical disadvantage due to his power. But now I genuinely believe Ngannou would be the more technical boxer between the two if they fought.   But anyways, regarding the fight itself, I think I went into it with a built in safeguard to help me deal with any potential anger/feeling of "let down" that comes from judges scoring. It feels to me that the few major boxing fights I have tuned in for, the scoring always leans to the more famous/high ranked fighter. Maybe it was some bad experience watching Floyd lol, but whoever's obviously getting attacked more, but stays defensive and boring, and lands a few peppery shots wins the round.   So in order to avoid super disappointment for a potential robbery, I tried to watch this from a strictly scoring standpoint. And as fucking stoked and excited as I was whenever Francis landed ANYTHING - I would try to ground myself with "okay, I gotta remember Fury's getting his licks in too, not all of these are hitting Fury cleanly, and the judges are probably giving him these close rounds". So even though the true fan in me felt Francis was winning, the "but boxing scoring likes to ruin the vibe" party pooper side of me kept pocketing all the rounds for Fury that didn't clearly favor Ngannou.   However, this forced "be ready for a robbery" mindset sort of allowed me to score from a very open minded standpoint. And then, I started noticing that in all these moments where I'm screaming in joy for Ngannou... Fury was ducking the worst of the combo. Popping Francis in the head to close off the exchange. Snapping the jab during the dead time between moments when I would usually be otherwise talking to my friends about how well Francis is doing. And come the end, I felt like Fury edged 6 rounds with his jab and simply landing a few more.   Yes, I was still forcing myself to value Fury's brief moments and jabs more than I usually would as a Francis fan. I was still forcing myself not to score Francis' combos too heavily when I noticed Fury rolling with the punches and not eating them flush. So I'm by no means claiming this was the type of assessment wherein I'd put my reputation on the line with this claim that Francis won. I'm not even sure I believe that at all - especially after seeing these comments. So I do want to re-watch it.  But honestly F the outcome. F the result. Francis FREAKING Ngannou just went out there and brought it to the Undisputed HW Boxing Champ for 10 rounds, knocked him down, had the more profound moments, took him to a split decision and arguably looked like the superior boxer - in his FIRST EVER boxing match. Absolutely incredible and a HUGE win for MMA. This should be the narrative and talking point about this fight. Huge W for Francis and MMA.  Definitely helps earn back some respect for our sport and the skill level some of our fighters have in the striking department - and that many of these MMA guys could possibly give top 5 boxers a run for their money if they dedicated a year to it. Heck, before tonight, people didn't even consider Ngannou to have the most skillful hands IN MMA outside of his offensive power, and he arguably showcased cleaner looking technical defense than the best boxer alive did tonight.
I knew they wouldn't give a ufc fighter the boxing belt 😂 francis won if it was that close. Props 2 both tho. But Francis should not feel down about this at all
Francis won that
#MADRESPECT to Francis,  he achieved what many haven't and Fury is the champion.  Rematch
so far for what i see we need a rematch
Nawl they wrong
Robbery at it’s finest
Fury looked like he was feeling everyone of those punches, his face also tells a story.
Wow
Boxing is such a joke now
That's crazy great fight
Good fight, Francis looked more comfortable out there for a lot of the fight which was shocking. I expected a lot more from Fury. The scoring and decisions in boxing make it hard to take serious. Imagine if the NBA didn't keep score and then at the end 3 judges decided who won... So lame. At the very least they should have to post their scores after each round to hold them accountable.
Robbery call the cops. They did it to us again.  I knew he needed a KO to win. Big ups to the Nigeria nightmare. We’ll get the next one. Waiting on the rematch. Just sad to be cheated like that. Clear win for the MMA champ.
Robbery smh
Nahhhh fury lost that 1
Boxing is a hoax if you ask me
Ain’t no way
Hmmm Jake Paul fighting mma fighters seems legit to me now.
Man for a first boxing match every he nearly beats the heavyweight champ of the world wtf !
To do this well vs one of the best heavyweights we’ve seen in years is a huge deal. Props to Francis. Would love to see him go against Wilder
Just here to say Francis got robbed‼️
Even Sugar Hill knew that Francis shook up Fury.  Francis did amazing and only good things for that guy. This was his story!
Tyson fury even felt like Francis won
Tyson loss...   That's crazy
I don't give a  flying fuck those judges need their eyes fucking surgery on Francis one that hands down
And still!!!! 🫡🫡🫡🫡. Gypsy king!!
What a disgrace Fury is.
Francis got Robbed.
They rubbed Francis against Fury . corruption everywhere
Not once watching this I taught fury was the better fighter robbed smh
Run it back and get that money fellas! Happy for the both of them.
Francis won
This is why we need to get rid of these promoters & the politicians of boxing cuz Ngannou won this fight, but as well all know it’ll make Fury look bad to lose against a guy on his pro first bout. Wilder aside Fury is the other cash cow in the heavyweight division & the big fight now is Fury & Usyk. Just like Usyk got gifted in his fight with Dubois when he got hit clean to the body. It’s all about the money & the money fight is Fury Usyk -Wilder Joshua and then the winners meet up for a mega showdown Which I believe will be a Wilder & Fury 4 IMO
Francis did better than everyone expected. He will learn that he has to TAKE a victory. Instead of trying to box with someone that has boxed all of his life and is the Champion, he should have made it a down right FIGHT!
Thats wat happens wen u get hit by the WRH of hardest punch
tbh MIKE TYSON DESERVES SOME RESPECT
Cheating mf
That’s bull sht man. Now I’m definitely convinced that this fight was rigged.
That was amazing fight
If he got a point deduction for the elbow it looks like Francis would have won !!! Wild
Fury is in disgusting shape…. He got his ass kicked…. Francis won
Best first bout of any pro ever, period.
Tyson fury lost that fight
Unfair match ever seen
Francis was robbed. This is the biggest robbery ever in the history of boxing
That ufc chin different bro shrugged off a elbow 😬
Francis won this fight
Imagine him and wilder 😳
Nagnnnou got Robbed
Tyson dirty ASF!!! 🤨
Looks like Fury lost from this video. He was knocked down and looked out.
This is the only crossover/influencer fight I know that has lived up to the hype
That elbow should have cost fury a point
Those 2 judges were either bribed, 💰💵 or need their heads examined. 🧠🔍 They were better off calling the fight a draw if they wanted to save Fury's record. 🙄🤦🏾‍♂️
He deserves this. Get that bag man.
Fury was extra flabby for this one, hopefully there will be a rematch and he'll take Francis more serious, he showed he isn't just an MMA fighter, very athletic, talented athlete.
Francis won that. The forget the Usyk fight! The world needs a rematch!!
But this black monster here who the f wants to see this dude coming at you in 10 11 and 12 round definitely scary but i think he should definitely switch careers and make a bunch of money like he deserves
No way they give him a decision over their sports champion. Knockout or no win. Vince wrote the decision.
I wanted and expected Fury to win but Ngannou did very good for his first boxing match. I even thought he might have taken it for a second. Hope to see him continue to box and be successful
I’m mad I didn’t see that fight…..
All professional sports are about the money now!!! Sad!
This result shows how corrupted the boxing organization. Come on Ngannou won
0:05 Had to be the LEFT😂 They never see it coming!!! This is a scam!!!
Although I'm a UFC fan, I always have thought Ngannou was much better suited for boxing. As his punches could easily connect and easily knock down or knock out anyone he's up against. He was always a much better fighter while standing up and that fact showed tonight. I felt that he should have won this, but the current champ always has the advantage going in and the biggest factor of all, MONEY$ talks. Can't have the next dream fight in boxing if one of the men slated to be a contender in it, loses. Great job Francis & congratulations to Tyson.
Rigged Boxing 🥊 😫😫😫Why have people place bets on Rigged fights🤦🏾‍♂️💯
Fury didnt train fot this fight, bad performance, he believed that it would be easier and the truth is that could lose the fight.
Ngannou did amazing  Tough fight but still did great
That knockdown caught fury off balance but the punch didn’t do anything to fury. Fury outclassed him the whole fight i don’t get what everyone is talking about.
He proved , he scared the boxer and he got more money 💰 😂
Do people not remember that Francis was a boxer before he switched to MMA?
Thats a rip off,Tyson got beat
Robbery. But it’s okay because remember, this is only the starting point. Watch him dominate the boxing world now.
Francis at time took his foot off the gas at time he still did good really good keep pushing
Um that first sequence was definitely choreographed
They robbed Francis like the Jews did Palestine 🇵🇸
That was a money grab give away
Francis won that sh#t!
Perhaps one of the most boring'est fights ever.  Thank God I watched it somewhere else and didn't pay for it.  Props to Francis for going 10 rounds but other than that, it stunk.   For the life of me, I don't understand why boxers makes millions more than UFC fighters.  UFC are exciting, multi-dimensional fights while boxing is one big hug fest.
Ngannou showed heart, will, determination, grit, & a great chin. If this guy stays in the gym with a great trainer & learn the science & true techniques of boxing then the heavyweights are in trouble, & I think with a guy like Ngannou getting decent fights & scoring big KO’S it’ll he’ll bring back the heavyweight division. He had the confidence now that he can hang with the best cuz he just fought the best heavyweight fighter & he dropped him so that gave him even more confidence that he can not only hang but can hurt these guys as well, cuz Fury hit the canvas with wide eyes & said whooo 😮he was hurt. So I’m looking forward to seeing more from Ngannou from this point on…
W Frances. Tyson felt that power and did good out boxing him but for Frances first boxing match to go the distance and lose only on a split shows his potential max respect to both champs
The fight I saw. Francis won. Keep making excuses in the comments. Glad to see corruption is the same in a Muslim country too.
If they let Francis win that. The boxing sport would have lost a lot of money. Everyone knows that
Fury looked sloopy 😂.  I think he needs to start taking shit seriously again.  Bad idea to use style he used against wilder against him.  Should have used his more effasive style
Tyson Fury has always been overated
Fury looked liked garbage
Not only incredible for Ngannou but impressive for Fury to once again rise to the challenge, put on a good fight, and do enough to get a win against a sports superstar
ROBBERY
Francis got robbed, Fury vs Usyk  a made fight so I can see why the boxing  judges scored in Fury's favor. How to sell the Fury vs Usyk fight having Fury lost today.
Ngonnou won!
Francis beat him.
Never seen one get knocked down and never dominate the fight when lol😅
No way!!!!
I got Francis Ngannou winning the rematch.
I’m shocked. Francis first fight was THIS good! He definitely has a future in boxing.
Tyson fury might play that humble guy role...but really he is a dirty fighter!
Without the refs fury not what "others" think...  Edit: sorry but without the refs AND THE JUDGES FURY IS NOT WHAT "THE OTHERS" THINK...
Francis showed that he has boxing skills.
Shows how pathetic boxers are these days. They can’t finish men who don’t box . But the one time a boxer went to the ufc he got koed quick
Tyson fights so sloppy and he’s fat af how tf is he the top heavyweight… N’Gannou should’ve won the judges are bias and don’t wanna end a winning streak of the #1 champion. I usually agree with all decisions but N’Gannou def got robbed
Look at Fury’s face compared to Ngannous lmfao
He won this fight.  boxing is so damn corrupt
I slept on him for sure but Mike Tyson coach of the year just for that lmao
Surprise, surprise. That slimy dusty shithole known as Saudi Arabia, who cuts its own journalists in pieces if their views digress from the state's, also orchestrates shady judging...
Straight robbed
Fuck that that has to be the worst decision I’ve ever heard in my life
Bro francis did so good. Should have been a draw honestly
francis vs logan or jake, where those clowns at 😂
Fury caught a ass woopin from a MMA fighter ... Mike Tyson taught him well ...
Rigged
Fury is looking old, weak and out of shape
I’m so happy for ngannou!!! I’m glad he got paid!! So many fat ass checks in the future after that dope performance
So a guy fighting his first boxing match loses a split decision to the "best heavy weight" an it's a loss? Not in my book
M he will beat Tyson.nutz
I can't believe how good Francis did he dropped Tyson Fury and I know everyone's going to say that Tyson didn't train for this but Francis did better than Wilder did outside of Wilder actually knocking him out and Tyson coming back to life amazingly I believe this is Tyson's first split decision win they will rematch
I call bullshit..!
Complete robbery, 96-93!? Wtf was that judge smoking
i see why fury don’t want usyk
The way Francis blew Cain Velasquez out that he would give Fury a tough fight.
Wow to me there is no losers on this bout very good performance by both men 👏
Francis was robbed.
Francis got robbed he won this fight don’t care what nobody say💯👆🏾
u can here that bullshit decision in the crowd, We live in clown world. Everything is fake
It was all for show u fools
Would’ve lost if ref saw that elbow and deduct 1 point. Him and his brother squeezing out wins this month.
This looked like a Smash and Grab 😅😅😅😅😅😅
Haven't seen a robbery like this since Canelo vs GGG 1.
Francis took the best heavyweight in boxing 10 rounds,no one saw this coming
And the judges scored zero rounds for Conner when he fought may Warner and Floyd threw 2 punches the 1st round   Boxing is dead.   If this was MMA 3 leg kicks fury would tap.  I wouldn’t talk about Jon jones he would strangle fury in under 20 seconds
Fury lost that cheating ducks
Who are these guys with these turbins and robes? Are they powerful or some kinda world leader??🤔🤔
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz........
Why fury didn’t employed the JAB in this fight?  Ngannou was there for the taking
All the respect to Francis obviously, no body expected it to go the distance. But this fight was not as close as the commentators would have you believe. Make this a 12 round fight and it would be a different story.
Tyson fury got one of the worst bodies ever
Big robbery💯💯💯
Wow
Tyson fury  is a cheater
Who's calling this, Adam Sandler?
That’s dance Francis did after the drop is gold. Congratulations
Are y’all really so blind and naive not to see that the entire thing was a charade?  The fight was choreographed to stir controversy. No different than WWE, DAZN, etc… it was a cash grab, a very good one, and a psychological tool against Usyk. If you think the same man will show up to fight for the unified title you’ve taken the bait. Fury will make you all sucka’s when he unifies the HW title.
*Wild fight! Francis knocked it out of the park!*
I don't think so
They robbed him that was furry worst fight and yet he got a split decision yea right
This is a bs fight, so many sale outs for money, Fury held back so much and allowed the fight to be close. That is disrespectful to boxing.
he did pretty good think if he focus more on his cardio can make through a 10 round fight without gassing out. an experience fighter will take advantage and its one of the biggest hurdles a ufc fighter has to overcome especially at his weight.
Rigged: (This Fight)
Fury for sure dropped intentionally, that left hook had zero power on it. Fury is a hell of an actor
Robbery.
Francis won!
Funny how many people a fans of boxers or the sport but know absolutely nothing of how the sport is judged and what its based from. Everyone thinks they are the best judge of a match lmao
I was wit Tyson the last month partying he never ran trained or dieted he literaly underestimated nganou n next fight will be a first round KO
This was a robbery
How is this possible?? Who h go it knocked down
Fury is a great boxer but he lost to the UFC fighter tonight it was close but judges robbed Francis
Fuckin gyped
WS
Francis won.
Robbery??
Fury is so dam out of shape. Remind me of the great white hype. Obviously didn’t take this serious.
Wierd huh. Almost like that had to happen
Francis got robbed.
I HATE ADS!!!🤬
Wow Francis did way better than Wilder.
We all just witness a armed robbery 🤦‍♂️
Tyson Fury looking like a sack of wet diapers 🤣🤭😂😂. How can you be a professional athlete and look that terrible?
Mike Tyson should be his coach permanently
What a robbery! I believe ngannou can compete with the top heavyweights in boxing
Ngannou in my opinion won this fight but the split decision win for Fury don’t surprise me. When there’s a reigning champion the challenger can really only win by KO or a stoppage because judges are so scared of getting it wrong.
He got paid though.... That's all he wanted
Was that elbow purposeful or accidental?
This is his rocky 1 moment
brooo cmon, with the knock down and getting illegally hit (he ate that shit like nothing too!)? did so good for his first high anticipated profile fight- job well done francis; didn’t disappoint at all
I think Francis can get some wins in the heavyweight division. I didn't even have to watch the whole fight to see that from a few clips. But I am about to watch it now. Peace.
What a rigged sport lol didn't even watch the fight but I knew they'd do this.
Fury looked kinda disappointed when he got dropped
Caught him off guard. How the hell you catch someone off guard in the middle of an exchange. Fucking bias commentating
Tyson loss that fight.
Ok if he do that I believe he can beat Jon jones that’s crazy!
i wish fury washed him, because these kinds of fights further and further prove to fury he can't beat usyk, so we'll never see that fight
Francis would annihilate Fury in the mma cage
Horrible selection of the highlights! You big dossers are sold for boxing. Francis had plenty more highlights to show. I get it though, Fury has an upcoming fight.
ksi solos
Tyson fury has been overrated this entire time.... Not suprised he lost
I knew Francis would do a good job for his first boxing match. I wanna see a rematch!
They stole this fight away from Francis
They robbed Francis ngannou Fuck these racist white people
Stole the fight from him
Well that’s a crock
Fury underestiamted him, and francis surprised everyone
Francis has a real future in boxing
Fury got his ass whooped this fight
Fury got pretty fucked up in that fight. he thought it was going to be some easy exhibition but that was one of the toughest fights of fury's career. some argue he could have lost that one.
Warms my heart.
Dude ngannou actually did insane for not being a professional boxer. All blessing to him man happy for him
No wonder he’s been ducking Usyk
Just shows you how far boxing has fallen and how weak the competitor are now.
This shit is beyond rigged
He beat fury 😮that robbed him
Time for boxers to cross into MMA
Francis proved tonight  he's a fuken  animal.  Bigg props to him and remember who trained him iron mike 🤙🤙🤙
This is where ngannou belongs. He left at a good time stay away from bones
Fury was much better
The house always wins.. never let it go to decision😅
Robbed in broad daylight
Anyone else notice fury is supposed to be 6’9 and Francis is 6’4 but here, they look the exact same height
FRANCIS WON HANDS DOWN.!!!! Dropped him received an elbow and went the whole distance.
You can not get in the ring and spare with the champ then think your going to win the belt.
How did fury win......
This is humor so exsposed
Francis won that imo. But they wouldn’t give it to an outsider if it’s left to decision.
When you cant WRESTLE your way through a boxing match...it looks totally different. Congrats to Ngannou for showing us what we all knew
Fury lost, and he should have dominated
Robooooi
The wilder vs Francis is up next and it will make bank!! Even in this loss Francis stock just shot up🎉
White boy put it on dat a$$!!!😂😅
AT LEAST A DRAW. HE LOOKED LIKE HE LOOKS TONIGHT. GREATEST OF ALL TIME,  BULLSHIT.
I don’t understand how Tyson fury can win when he does an illegal elbow and gets knocked down
Fury should give Francis that belt. As the world heavy champ, he was almost beaten by a guy in his first professional boxing match. Give him the belt and ask for a rematch to win it back properly Tyson.
Give FG that cardio... he will be unbeatable...
Yo Fury was scared!  He tried to stop the fight with that elbow.  They would have called the match if Francis opened up bad.  Holy shit
There must have been more that fury did that wasn't shown in this hl reel because it looks like fury lost
So you get knocked down and still win
Boxing’s rigged Francis would’ve won but if he did then the fight between fury and usyk would be meaningless
Deum I think this might be the biggest robbery of the year
I’m so glad I don’t watch boxing, shit is so fixed😂 At least in UFC the fighters decide the outcome
Francis did really good, There is a chance that Fury didn't take this seriously enough and in a rematch it might be a different fight. Don't know just sayin
Well ofcourse they wasn’t gonna let furry lose
Tf they robbed Francis smh
People keep saying regardless of outcome, keep it 100. Fury lost. Despite this being Francis first boxing match, despite Fury throwing elbows and headbutts, he not only went the distance but won. But as always people make it racial instead of keeping it honest. Fury is a beast but he lost. Just look at Fury’s face and Look and Ngannous. The way ppl make excuses for this robbery is truly disgusting
For what i see Fury lost that fight.
Fury is so nice he didn’t want to be boring so he let ngano knock him down
Fury better start working out
That 'left hook' was Mike Tyson's specialty and his strongest weapon.  I think Mike Tyson should continue being a trainer.
I’m the type of person to admit when I’m wrong, and Francis really proved me wrong on this one not only did I think he would lose but I thought that Tyson would come out and walk him down easy Francis was the one scoring that knocked down on one of the greatest heavyweight boxers ever earlier in the third like that really really awesome job from him. Tyson might be getting a little old lol but I wanna see more boxing matches by Francis for sure after this.
Francis did great. Likely better than anyone's expectations, save for his own. He may actually have won, but subjectivity is unavoidable. Sometimes it's in your favor, other times, it is not.
Another  clasic Cooking show on Box sport  no surprise  at all all this corrupts are slowly  killing the sport with all their crap🤢🤮
I can tell Francis learned a lot from Mike Tyson.
Francis Nagano kick Tyson fury ass f poor judges bullshit if this fight truly was for the belt Tyson lost it the world knows now we seen it who's the real bad man
Ngannou went toe to toe with the champ and won in most people eyes, he knocked him down 🤷🏾‍♂️ and went the distance. That’s a strong man! Shout out to Francis Ngannou✊🏾🥊
I didn't even seee this fight I had work but damn am I so proud of Francis. Tyson deserves some praise as well 0-1 to a beast like fury I say keep this going!!!!
Bruh wtf..
Fury won the fucking fight .  His opponent did a great job . Fury needs to pull his pants for the next one .
If these are the 100% best moments of the fight this shit is rigged.
Rigged
This brother is the best .. Francis I am so proud of you… don’t mind this stupid people… you beat that bloke hands down.. thank you the great Mike Tyson for your hard work…
Francis robbed
Now let's go to the cage Tyson
Tyson Fury is nothing but a pussy I know its all about the white man but a Brother from Africa can't get credit and the win because he is black. Give Ngannou a rematch and be a man about it pussy.  Francis Ngannou is the new heavyweight champion
Francis must be the pound for pound best now!
Goes to show how horrible heavyweight boxing has become Fury is horrific
They cheated again that’s why nobody watch boxing watch how much they start losing
Why didn’t they count that knock down
Them lying ass white people
Francis won this fight bro
I'm a Fury fan but this was Rigged
There’s gonna be a rematch
Highway robbery
that’s not off guard anddd francis looked great
Most obvious dive ever 😹
Always said Tyson fury is garbage thanks
I know they will compensate Francis Ngannu for accepting the defeat to Tyson Furry, this fight should have been a draw or a win to Francis
Are we gonna ignore the fact Fury gave Francis a whole elbow and the man just walked right through it…this is the look fury had : 😳
Boxing is rigged like wwe
I’ve definitely seen that elbow before from fury
Yo. I'm so impressed! Francis actually looked like a boxer! And he knocked the best heavy weight in the world on his ass! 🤯
Fransis finally giving mms fighters some respect by his actions ! No other mms fighter has been good in a boxing match
Fury was treating this like a joke, and it almost cost him.
Fixed
Like father like some. For some reason when they lose they still win.
Ngannou should've won.
Entertaining
You put Francis in the cage with Tyson he's gonna for sure beat furry.
Francis needs to fight jake paul now
I already know fury is a documented dirty fighter. But 2 throw an elbow is weak af. He got knocked down early and the fact that he couldn’t dominate a ufc fighter that enters in YOUR field shows me fury should’ve lost.
Tbh jake paul could beat ngannou
Ngannou is the goat.  Beat everyone in heavyweight and then went toe to toe with the best heavyweight boxer in the world. Truly unbelievable. If Dana had a brain he'd pay 20 million to book jones ngannou.  The two goats
Trash fight but great production for the show 😂
Wow, what a robbery 😂 this is why boxing is dying
The world of boxing fudged the numbers to keep one of their own legit. Robbery, total.
That’s why showtime don’t want part of this corrupt sport frauds smh boxing is dead with all there rigged matches Francis won
FRANCIS WON!!
Embarrassing
Francis. The true champ.
SLAVIC POWER
Wow… more highlights!!! This sort clip looked like nganu won
Tyson fury would be mike tyson you guys smoke dope
I knew there was know way they was giving this fight to Francis. That would've  messed up there plans completely. For the unification fight. But the people know who won this fight. Salute to Francis
They cheated they never give it to the black man EVER😂
Fury overlooked Francis thinking of Usyk. Bad mistake Francis can fight.
Rigged
Run that back
Oh fuck francis won
Usyk gonna drop him
I'm want Francis to win because hi have the balls to say fuck to Dana white
Fury clearly wasn't taking him seriously and he paid the price and nearly lost. Would love to see a rematch at some point, Fury would have to take him as seriously as he took wilder in the second match to win because ngannou will only get better!
I’m sorry but Fury lost
Please tell me there was a rematch clause
Fxckn robbery 😂 😂 😂
I didn't watch but it seems like boxing took a giant L as a whole tonight
Bro Francis won this Idgaf
Rigged BS
Fury lost
Sittin sideways😂
Francis won this shit!!! Robbed
Elbow it is Francis Javier Gooseman
Draft king would lose tons of money if they let Francis win. No No
Great performance by Ngannou! Is there any video of the roberto duran jr vs jack mcgann knockout?
Big for nothing😂
He fought him harder than  Wilder. This man is the truth!
Let’s be real Fury only won because he has that experience in boxing.
After being put down by a MMA fighter & committing robbery to secure the victory Tyson Fury will not & can not ever go down in the record books as the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time
Omg everyone shocked Francis got a knock down against Tyson lol I knew that would happen off of the Bronx bomber knocked Tyson down and he’s way smaller than Francis lol…it’s a boxing match not a get 1 knock down to zero and you automatically win lol…Francis is known for his punching so yea in a boxing match I wouldn’t be shocked to see how he did but you still have to be able to out box the other guy and not just count on knock downs and knock outs! Good fight though
Good job!
TRASH!!! He’s NO KING!
Francis Ngannou clearly got robbed this was a political boxing decision so they can save the face of boxing after Ngannou beat up fury one of the faces of boxing
RIGGED,  RIGGED,  RIGGED!!!
Francis would've finished him 1st round in a real fight obv😂
Lol. I knew that hurt earlier.
You guys have to think about how boxing is so corrupt nowadays. You really think they're going to let a UFC fighter win a fight and defeat one of their best boxing marketing tools? There's no way Tyson Fury won this fairly
francis is fucking scary. even for a guy if furys size and skillset.
Ngannou is the peoples champ!
Bullshit
You know Francis should probably move into boxing.  He did lose the fight but in a short amount of time he could make a solid run at it.
Great job winning the Fight Francis Ngannou. 👏🏾
Francis was robbed
Ngannou bet on himself and it's looking like he might be here to stay if his stamina improves. He increased his pay. Can't hate on that.
Tyson Fury is alright with me. Kudos to Francis Ngannou.
Fake Azz Boxing Judges, ALL BUMS!!!
Bro fury is ass no way it should b that close
I think Francis won! Welcome to boxing Francis, no one will doubt you can box now!
The thing I dont like about boxing is that it's not realistic. Whoever goes down first should lose.
Francis won in my heart. But I'm also amazed how Tyson wasn't dazed after getting hit from the temple
Tyson is the still the best!
so the guy who got knocked down won??
Like the original Rocky movie
The biggest robbery
Bru Francis got robbed
That's Some BuuulllllSheet!
That's some fkng Bullshit!!!
I am wondering where are all the Ngannou haters now? They hated that this man wanted to help other fighters get better paychecks. It was a whole army of hating losers repeating exactly what Dana White said. Sometimes I suspect the UFC has a army of bots repeating whatever bullshit serves the interests of that exploitative company.
unbelievable
robbery
Francis won that wtf???
That elbow was intentional.
Done with boxing
Tyson cant help but to cheat. He tridd to elbow but aingvhijne work against Francis 😂😂
That elbow cheater didn't win
The Saudi dude whispering in Nganno’s ear sayin don’t worry my G I’ll give you DOUBLE for this
I can’t believe Francis beat Tyson 😮, “ I know Tyson won on paper” but Francis actually beat him. And I think Francis would ko wilder
Damn…the highlights need some highlights!
Congratulations  Francis amazing fighter
You can see the look on Fury's face; I think he hits harder than Wilder 😳.
Francis won 🏆 that fight 👏 he was a victim of boxing corruption.
im speechless. i was certain fury was going to low dif him. this is wild
ROBBERY
Francis won. We understand the reason why didn't get the win this time though.
Francis got robbed🤷🏾‍♂️👎🏾
The FIX WAS IN 😅
Fury is lucky that Ngannou’s instincts didn’t having him dropping the hammer fist of the gods.
This was a real Rocky fight. Life imitating art. 😂
He should’ve won
Fury lost. all sports are rigged for the highest payer
Robbed
imagine if he would’ve caught all of that knockdown punch. He nipped fury with that left and knocked him down. 😂
RIGGED B.S.
Francis ate that elbow and didn’t budge.
Nganou won this fight
Props to both Great fighters and attitude
How did Ngannou not win that fight.
Very obvious who really won, but god forbid a mma fighter beat one of the best boxers even with all the disadvantages
Robbery
Bullcrap
_FRANNCIS WON BUT HE DIDN'T KO_
Fury Won by one point. Francis should be proud it was expected to be blow out if it made it to later rounds but he made Tyson work n almost took him out. Francis should work cardio n learn numbers game n he could make a really good boxer
From these highlights Fury did nothing but get hit lol and you can who really won fight from the damaged done who gave 😂
Of fuckin course smh
They cheated my guy Francis smh
Rigged
He got cheated Francis won this fight
Francis was robbed
So... NOBODY saw Fury throw an Elbow after Francis Dropped him???!!!!
I think Francis should stick to boxing
What a robbery omfg
money grab
i couldn’t give a crap who won this fight but come on!, it’s borderline reality tv boxing,  it’s just money men making money, of course there’s gonna be a big money rematch, they earned $50m for tyson and $10m for francis tonight, why wouldn’t they want to do it again?
They can say what they want, those score cards are crazy... Fury lost, even if the point actually did save him, he lost bad
He should keep boxing
I’m truly impressed by Ngannou’s toughness. That elbow from Fury would’ve cut most boxers leading to an early stop.
Some Straight BullShiggady
ahh man... the most bull$#!+ fight ever.  man what  sellout. unreal stupidness.  i know you think im hating or jelouse. no. this was just clear cut bs
Obviously boxing is rigged and dead now
Of course they gave it to fury . He clearly did not do as good as Francis but the big bosses favor him.
Francis won that fight
I will say one thing .. Francis is blessed with power .. so even if he doesn’t know the sport .. just one shot that lands will damage his opponent 💯
FRANCIS WON THIS FIGHT. Boxing is a real scam
Considering he just came into boxing and did extremely great against the top of the heavyweight division P4P, ngannou can really make a full switch to boxing and be a great if he decides to 🙏 💯
Obviously that shit is unfair
Francis vs Paul!!! Knock that p***y out!
Tyson fury definitely lost that match.
Ngannou really the better fighter. Imagine if he had a couple years of boxing experience smh.
Fury could even cut francis with an elbow. Thank saudi for the fixed judging.
Robbery!
Can’t wait to see a movie about this guy.
Francis got robbed
Cheats 😅
Franices is the definition of standing on business 🙌🙌🙌🙌
Shitty corruption boxing
You people actually think this wasnt planned. Now they can run it back for another 100 million, have Frabcis win and do a 3rd fight for the title. Sheep.
Rematch!
Lmao they robbed him blind 😂😂😂
Pure robbery smh
Im going to go home and re-watch, but i think francis was robbèd. Imagine if fury lost, hed come up with some Bogus crap. He even said the knockdown was because he hit him in the back of the head. No way, he hit the temple
I’m really impressed with Francis boxing skills. He showed up and fought a good fight. Tough loss though.
I had it 6 rounds to 4 Ngannou. And a Knockown. Controlled the ring majority of fight. But for one judge to score it 96-93 would've meant he had Fury winning 7 of 10 rounds, which is absolute ridiculous. A draw would've been even a reach. I see it as they needing to preserve Fury's record to draw in next crowd for his USYK matchup. Complete robbery but also, huge W for Ngannou. To stand in there with the champ to the last round for a 1st fight is unheard of.
Jon Jones ain’t hurt. After this Francis’ credibility stock went up and if he comes to the UFC him and Jon Jones would be HUUUGGGEEEEEE. That’s what’s gonna happen, in my opinion
I want to see a rematch for the title, that was really close
I've never been a fan of  Tyson Fury, but I want to thank him for giving Francis Ngannnou this opportunity, he changed that man's life trajectory forever, it was a big man move.  Thank you Tyson Fury, thank you the Gypsy King, I love you brother!!
Who needs sanctioning Bodies for Boxing ?????A ranking system that only allows promoters fighters to get a title shot.  PPV has been drawing us away from believing this old system works at all, or at least gives the fan a fight to see that would once be impossible.  We are not talking a Stephen A Smith vs Greg Brady match but a MMA legit tough guy who was unranked in boxing taking his 1st pro boxing fight. Leon Spinks had Beat Ali after his 8th pro fight, this was a MMA star who had fought 20 times so nobody to taken lightly for sure. The Decision will be questioned, no doubt MMA fighters do not belong and one day soon Boxing's EGO will disappear when the MMA has a duel champion MMA?BOXING  in many weight  divisions . The takeover is coming closer than people think.
That's what happens when you leave it up to the judge.😡
Francis did his thing! Not the outcome he wanted but keep training! He's gonna be a problem
Fury lost ngannou got robbed
Ngannou was impressive great chin too
It appears "old fatty" almost spit the bit, he really "dodged a bullet here"!
I heard Francis got robved
10-9 francis
Thank god I didn’t pay for this fight…
WTF
Fury had no highlights
thats a solid elbow from fury.. he had a few good back of the head punches too.. That guys supposed to be the best boxer in the world huh?
Boxing is such a joke now.
I watched the whole fight, Francis won  This was an absolute robbery boxing absolutely is pathetic.
francis won
francis won lol yall boxing judges about as bad as mma judges
This just set the tone for Francis next fight..His stock just went up..yesterdays prices are not todays prices..
Uysk is the best boxer in the world. 🇺🇦
Francis is a legendary tier fighter. Shame we didn’t see him fight Jon Jones.
The referee even stand besides fury. this is rigged booooooooo..
Robbed without a gun‼️🤦🏾
ROB
what judge gave furry 96-93 tf was he watching
The elbow should’ve been one point take away. Boom it s a draw
What a performance 💪🏽 I would have paid this man what he desired *Dana White smh*
Francis won the fight ….
They still cheating for Fury smh
Sorry that was BS!! He won that fight!! Smh
Francis did well and looked comfortable, but Tyson looks like he didn’t train at all
Fury gave an MMA elbow and wasnt penalized?? This fight was fixed. Francis won!
Just the furry been throwing elbows to a  rookie boxer, he should’ve lost just because of that 🤣🤣🤣
Um Tyson fury did not win that fight…
bruh francissss
They whispered in his ear..we had to give it to him but you really won 😂
suprised me props to francis
*Noone ever talks about Francis’s granite chin. It’s legendary.*
So much better than watching the Paul Brothers fight. actual high-level guys putting on a good show.
Ufc fans have no idea about boxing to be saying  Francis won 😂 he did but good, but come on
Kind of annoying these are the only highlights a broadcaster like ESPN could do. A lot of good shots landed during fight
Francis is people’s champ
Francis won that fight
Francis got robbed!!!
Ngannou = Rocky I
Francis should have won that fight they didn't want the upset for his first fight  I want a rescore it was only one point
Stop paying for fixed competition! Smh
Rid Francis should of won
Let's be real Francis won the fight but Tyson wasn't losing that belt
Furry lost hands down
Rematch.
Black ppl not getting a fair shake ?? Wow, thats new !!
Riged Francis clearly won
Francis won wtf
That elbow was intentional
NGANNOU GOT ROBBED
Fury didn’t take the man seriously it it almost cost him. Going to a big money rematch that ends with a blow out mark my words!
Tyson Fury looks like a divorced PE teacher.
fight game rigged
He won that fight what the hell
The result was way closer than I thought it was going to be.. usually when MMA fighter crosses over to boxing they get worked but Francis impressed with his boxing skills in debut for sure
Damn, I love Fury, but now I see why he won’t fight Usyk
Why my mans look fater then Andy Ruiz lol 😂
Rematch...
Get the bag, Ngannou 🎒 💸  💰 !!!
Fury was very dirty in the fight.  I think he saw himself loosing, so he resorted to the dirty tactics.
Fury 🗑️🗑️🗑️
And this my friends is why boxing is going to shxt. ARROGANCE with another robbery RIGHT IN OUR FACES. Who’s gonna stand up for what’s right!?. Anybody?…. This sport is losing devoted fans by the second. Wwe performances…
Tyson Fury is a much more skilled and experienced professional fighter. Francis not being knocked out is a win.
Robbery, I only saw this video 🤣
Francis is a bad man. Loses a split decision against the linear hw champ
Ngannou winning wasn’t part of the script
I only saw the highlights but if Francis did not get knocked down,maybe he should have one but i think anytime a fight is close they give it to the champ.
Let’s be honest. Boxing I’d say it may have been an off night for Tyson but Francis is definitely an elite boxer. And add the fact Francis, while not the best ground fighter, can wrestle and has some prior knowledge of submissions. I’d say Francis is clearly the better fighter, boxing is one part of it and he’s still shown here he is elite at that. He was a kick boxer to start with
This is why ufc is better, this man just got robbed
Fury with these dirty hits and he lost this clearly Wtf up with these Politics   Fucking up sports
I'd like to see Francis box again...he' already a better boxer than wilder and I think he would be a nightmare for that British black dude w/ the soft chin
Can't believe this was competitive
So does this mean Francis Ngannou is a better fighter than Conor McGregor?
Booooo! Rigged!
Francis did solid for a UFC fighter
Pure Robbery despite I chose Fury over Ngannou  . 🤷🏿‍♂️🤠🤠🤠
This is why I don’t watch or respect boxing. I love the sweet science but the corruption disrespects the art
Props to Francis and Tyson.
Francis got power bro dude has one of the hardest punches in the  MMA and Fury was throwing dirty shots man was scared  if Francis wanted to change his field he’d do well he’d be ok
Fury lost like Floyd lost to De LaJoya.
Francis’s life will be a movie one day 💯
Booooo Booooo Booo Booo Call 911 There's been a robbery
Gimme Ngannou Wilder next! That fight would be wicked!  Two heavy hand Heavyweights!
Francis Won obvious!
I knew this was going to happen… you never underestimate you opponent. One punch can change everything
Rob
I don’t think anyone expected this fight to be so close.
Precisely why I don't believe in sports anymore. Francis was robbed. This is because Tyson vs Usyk is the money fight. Fans need to boycott. Stop supporting this stupid shit.
Francis needs to call 9ll to report a robbery
Francis Ngannou Won wtf
Cap
96 93???? LMFAO YEAH OK BUD
Wow, can’t believe what I just saw!!
I SAID BEFORE AND I SAID IT AGAIN TYSON FURY IS OVERRATED!!🤣🤣🤣
No fukn way! Francis won that shit!😮 WTF???
Fury’s jab cross was so dam solid.
Was it just one knoxk down?
😢😢, Just Rob the man,, Boxing is so fake 😮
0:54 lol boxing is fake
Pathetic
That should not have happened good for Francis. Its like a triathlete being very competitive. With Michael Phelps Francis just embarrassed Fury.
This fight and the decision is like a real life version of Rocky.
Francis just created wealth for himself to provide for his health and future. He should stick to boxing until he figures a way out if he's not fighting for the UFC.
Fury's eye tells the story. How did he win
Fury family keeps on paying off the judges
Francis won.....screw the fury family
Good grief fury looked horrible
Wow now that’s a robbery max form for ya
Fury’s dirty ass really through an elbow. That’s crazy
0:53 … if Francis is not an mma fighter he definitely stops fighting there and complains to the ref . Mad props for eating that and still walking forward !
He was Robbed!
With the elbow and knock down  shit should of been a drawl
These Saudis got so much money, they out here collecting fighters and making them battle like they're fuckin Pokemon
Bullshit We All Know What It Is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
After this fight i don't see how Jon Jones could beat someone like Francis hes just too good!!
THIS WAS A GREAT CLOSE AND UNEXPECTEDLY " A (COMPETITIVE-FIGHT) BETWEEN TYSON & FRANCIS.. HOWEVER, " I HAD IT 115/113 IN FAVOR FURY..   I MEAN, A (DRAW) WOULDN'T HAVE BOTHERED ME TO BE HONEST.. OR IF THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS (CLOSE-DECISION) TO THE BLACK-HULK.. EITHER WAY, "👉🏾IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT AT ALL A (ROBBERY)!!!🤷🏾🥱💯
That punch had nothing on it, staged for publicity.
Francis surpassed expectations so much holy GOOD JOB FRANCIS
Tyson fury is a dirty fighter
nah this is bad for boxing and by that I mean not giving francis the W  fury got beat at his own sport but they couldnt let it happen  the african man should be champ now
Francis won that for sure but whatever 😭🤦🏾
Talk about robbery
Fury lost
They cheated  Francis won the fight  all the rounds
They cheated my boy he put him on his ass
All BS money moaning scheme  People just want the spectacle, it’s doesn’t have to be real
I knew this wouldn’t be a stoppage. They’re both too tough to be knocked out.
What Tyson fury really threw an elbow.  Should be disqualified.  I don’t agree with this.
fury lost this fight.
One thing is for sure, jake paul will NOT be calling out francis
Fury got that high buttcrack
Francis Robbed
Man fury lost frfr
The look on both of their faces when the score cards are being read tells you all you need to know. One man knows that he won and was hoping that he didn’t get screwed by the decision the other man knows he lost and is praying that the fight is fixed and the judges give him the nod. The look of Francis’s face after the decision wasn’t a look of a man who lost a fight but a man bummed out that the biggest moment in his fighting career was taken from him, ripped right out of his hands in front of the whole world but it’s alright we all know who actually won this fight.
Jon Jones been real quiet ever since Tyson dropped
Seems like Ngannou got robbed
Dirty fighter same as always.
No f****** way he got rot
It was a good fight, but i had Francis winning this. I understand though when it comes to beating the champ in boxing or mma you have to beat them convincingly in order to win. If its ever close the champ will retain the belt. I was worried Tyson was just going to try and lay his body weight on Francis to tire him out, but that didnt happen. Kudos to both of them.
This is my boxing is a dying sport
Fury is a fcking cheater he deliberately throw a illegal elbow that grazed ngannou the ref should have taking a point for that but I still think ngannou won that  fight...REMATCH....REMATCH.. AND MAJOR PROPS TO MIKE TYSON FOR HELPING TRAIN THAT GUY
Francis robbed
😂😂😂all sports are a complete circus show now
WACKERY
Francis deserves a rematch!
Francis won
This why boxing will never come back to big rating it's rigged Tyson fury lost every round
Francis won period and I’m a boxing fan 🥊💯
I don't want to hear anything about Fury being one of the best heavyweights of all time. To get knocked down and only win by split decision against a guy in his boxing debut is comical. You put Ali or Foreman or even Mike Tyson in that ring with Ngannou and Francis is out within 3 rounds.    This match also underscores how weak the current crop of boxers is. If Ngannou is one of Fury's toughest fights and Fury is the best heavyweight in the world, P4P top 10, that says a lot about guys like Wilder and Joshua.
Rigged,joke!
Any sports match that can be swayed one way or the other can be bought. The only winners are Vegas and any betting house, the house always wins. If you're in the belief that any win, loss or tie are in any way in the balance, and that entertains you. Then you at least have that, but let's not kid ourselves, it's all a mirage. And the outcome is never in doubt. Of all the sports I think I'll stick to Wrestling, at least it kisses me on the lips before it bends me over.
My man FN should of worked on a jab he got some stuff to work on but he fought well I would like to see him again but more polished
Francis got robbed.  This is why boxing sucks, it's rigged.
These highlights look like Francis won the fight.and shows Tyson fury throwing elbows 😮😊-roberry-
How?
This is actually a perfect ending. Francis won one judge but Fury keeps his title.  Very satisfying
Still much rather see Wilder vs Francis
we all just witness a ROBBERY. Im so glad i dont bet on sports anymore.  Francis is the baddest man on thus earth
Ha ha... Francis throwing that Iron Mike counter hook. Fury is a bum!!
Once again Judges cheat for fury
I could beat tyson fury with no training he does not  deserves that belt  a dad body champion  a fraud  a wwe fight
If Fury thought he was the GOAT this proved he was not.
Great performance Francis!!!! You now have the respect of the boxing community....... NEVER COUNT OUT ANYONE .........,.
Fury def didn’t train
fury couldn't cheat an got his @$$ beat 😂 he prolly was on coke an peds still but wasnt enough he shoulda rigged his gloves again  how was fury gassed in a 10 rd fight but was much bigger and full of energy vs wilder an no floppy gloves here ? he didn't have the cocaine or peds for this fight and it shows he took ngannou light and got beat up..fury came to hug and get punched in the face fury won the game by rigging once again but obviously ngannou won the fight !
Ahh yes Boxing, the sport where you Win after getting your ass kicked.
Robbery
No way are we getting Usyk vs Fury in December...
From the highlights I saw Fury lost that fight.
LOOK HOW FAT FURY IS THO😂😂😂
Robbery
Francis got a knock down. Got elbowed in a boxing match and still lost? Right. Great fight Francis. I think he could shake the heavyweight division up
Wow Fury is straight booty…almost lost to someone that doesn’t even box 😂 probably one of the worst heavyweight champs right next to Andy Ruiz
Scripted pay day
Fury lost 🤬
Fury whooped that punks ass. Let they be a lesson to you
Everyone expected Francis to get finished in the first round but he did great despite losing.
LOL. THAT WAS FIX
Why is Tyzon fighting close instead of keeping his distance
Imagine Mike boxing Tyson fury. This proves Tyson would have gave tyson a lot of trouble.
Cheap shot artist
Nganou was definitely the winner
Rigged asf
Francis shocked the sht out of me with his boxing skills.  For the record, fk Dana White and the UFC bc  Dana White sold out and started sponsoring these pedos (BUD LIGHT), who is with grooming of  little children to these sick pedos. So if I was Francis I would tell Dana White to go screw.  We should all boycott the UFC for Dana White supporting and sponsoring BUD LIGHT.
He was banged up badly Fury I’m not understanding this fight
Dude he should have got slammed on his ass and grounded pounded for that elbow
0:53 Tyson been watching ksi highlights
Even Fury knows he lost.
Ooof Francis knocked him down
Respect
Damn Francis is no fuckin joke...man he really changed my mind about Fury kinda knocked him down a couple pegs for me...great job Nganu
After the fight, Fury: "That didnt   go as planned." Sounds like he was the PLANNED winner. 😂 Done with 12 rounds of boxing.
Tyson didn’t train
Good sportsman ship from both,  even after that elbow
Now, lets get Fury in an MMA octagon against Francis.
Francis wasn't winning any decision. It wouldn't look good for boxing. A UFC fighter coming in and beating the best in his first ever boxing match
It wouldn't have mattered if ngannou knocked down fury every round. The judges wouldve still ruled it in fury's favor because itll look bad for a debut boxer to take their golden boy. The only way ngannou couldve won was by tko or ko.
That’s why the Paul brothers took over boxing
Robbery
this made me look at fury differently 😭
Jajja some one call the police!!! It a robbery
🤦🏽‍♂️
People underestimated Francis too much
Fury lost this fight. He clearly didn’t look the same I’m assuming he got off the PED’s for this fight. Wilder would’ve whipped the floor with this version of fury
Rematch
That 96-93 was pure nonsense  ..What fight was that judge watching
Boxer is a scam now 🤦‍♂️ Tyson clearly lost 😂
Seems nobody wants to tell the truth cuz they all wanna make sure they make it back home,Broadcasters were talking mid 10th round like Ngannou won with " unbelievable " " Ngannou has done it " ...Ngannou was boutta raise his hand in victory too and was like Wtf!? Fury had to win becuz it hurts the credibility of that fight he signed with ( forgot name )
Dam shame
Mcgregor “you fought him once, I wanna see it again”
Did I just hear "This is what Ronaldo saw" The celebrity adulation in Arabia is second hand embarrassment.
Robbed
What a left hook.
The furys be robbing people
Smh
Won that fight
Stop being fruits. If you watched it,  you're a bot/pawn/the problem. The real issue is Tyson Fury kissing another grown man on the cheek after a fight.
Might as well go watch Aew. Just a glorified sparring match
Fury didnt look like he was trying
Y'all know Francis
Francis was robbed smh.
Robbery to keep the money flowing from Fury’s name
Holy smokes, who saw that coming. Many were saying Ngannou didn't even have a puncher's chance, though some said he did. Just shows you never really know what's going to happen when two accomplished fighters step into the ring.
Ngannou just has a chin that’s all and Fury has never been a power puncher. This was just a fixed spectacle lol.
RIGGED
Nganou eats elbows for breakfast lol didn't even feel it
That Elbow was on purpose but Francis use to those
once again I witnessed a boxer win a bout jus because he could withstand his opponent… even after getting knocked down jus like the first fight with deunte wilder
Tyson with the dirty elbow 😭
Tyson Fury did not win this fight. He didn’t even look comfortable accepting the win when they announced his name
Francis is robbed here.....
Bro Definitely got robbed no doubt
How did Fury win?
He was the only one to score a knock down and Fury was hurt.
Give furt the edge but was a great fight though
This was a great fight, Francis did amazing against fury. Im glad to see him evolve. Hes gonna be a monster once he gets a little more training and matches.great fight all around.  Congratulations guys!!
Robbery this shits crazy yo 😂😂😂
Boxing politics
RIGGED
Usych will smoke Fury
If those highlights were the fight how the hell did fury win? And also the elbow hit did he even get a point deducted?
Ngannou shoulda won
Man this was Ngannou’s night
wonder how much mike got paid for training francis
Wow never expected this. Well done
This is what it looks like when the MMA fighters are not paid off to lose and make the other clown look good.
Ngannou won that fight
Bunch of Bull
Ngannou could not beat wilder
Y'all know for real that Francis won that fight SMH
No way they give a MMA guy the title on a decision in his debut. That would take away the credibility of boxing 😂😂
Ngannou is a monster
Awesome fight from both these guys tonight.  Thoroughly impressed with Frances' debut in the boxing ring and he's only gonna get better.  Hope to see a rematch.
I can’t believe so many people fall for this garbage. They’re just stealing money from all of the people that watch this crap.
fckng boxing is becoming worse than ever! I love the sport so much that it makes me sad!... just to lure more crowds(money) for the 2nd bout, for making them mad that they cheated... I mean wtf!!!!
This shows how hard Francis hits. Fury was shocked and dazed hard off a missed left hook. Had it hit squarely that would have been lights out. Fury still won the most rounds and won the fight but what a performance by Francis. Very very proud of him/
Rematch
Now I wish I would have watched the fight. Looks like it was a lot closer than most people thought it would be. If Francis is that good at boxing he should switch over. Way more money, way less elbow, knees, ground and pound etc.
The dude got robbed. The same story with boxing.
I’m late but was he robbed or no lmk experts
😂😂😂😂😂 dam fury
Big Ups To Francis Man But He Lost He Really Can Do This Boxing Shit Though...
Who commentating
these highlights blow
That was a fake knockdown -  these are all staged pantomime matches.
We know you won Francis. We're proud of you. Amazing and inspirational.
This was a payday fight for everybody
Mike Tyson taught Francis that over hook left that Mike does. 😂😂😂
Francis got robbed. Cameroon 🇨🇲 and Africa are proud of Francis 🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿👏🏾
Someone didn't take this match as seriously he should have. Didn't watch it, but I'm sure others would agree watching these few minutes of highlights.
WOW!!! ... gained my respect! The World is yours
The world backwards how the hell u win both fights where u damner got knocked out 🤦🏾‍♂️ DAMN MAN, we can’t win to lose 😭😭💯
I've said it once and I'll say it again - This shit rigged like a mfer.
Yeah didn’t see em giving the win to Francis even tho he won, what about that illegal attempt with the elbow shot??? Same old Tyson Fury gets away with cheating lol..great job Francis
Robbery
Cheating white people... everything is fixed with them no way they actually said fury won
Tyson fury got his ass beat, mad bruises on his face and somehow won? This is a joke.
Trash production. Average fight.  Took wayyyy too long to start and all the concert stuff was very very cringeworthy.  Boxing is trying sooo hard to make up for lost ground to UFC, and they’re doing it in all the worst possible ways.  All in all it felt like it was a waste of time to watch.
How da hell did fury win?
Boxing still corrupt. Big reason why MMA took over.
Francis Ngannou vs Pope Francis! Let's make it happen! 🇨🇲🆚🇻🇦
Boxing 😂 rigged tyson lost and im neutral on both i like them the same but tyson lost 👊rigged
There will be a rematch and Fury will take the fight seriously
Straight robbery this is bs ..
He literally got robbed an Tyson must've paid one of judges so he won't be humiliated this boxing dumb
Robbery
White privilege 😂
Francis won. Idc. That man beat the HW champ I had him winning the first 4, 8, and maybe 9
A draw was the right decison. Giving Fury a win is injustice
Francis won!
Have a 12  round rematch this time for the title.  Imagine another 6 months of boxing training for Ngannou.  He could win it all.
Damn they robbed that man of the W! Fury knows in his heart he lost that fight, and eventually that’s going to eat at him.
Boxing is so corrupt.
Bro tyson lost
Did he even knock France down???
Francis body shot wore Fury down, That stab to the body was nice throughout, he slipped majority of Tyson’s power punches, knew how to hold him back when Tyson tried to clinch after wild missed shots, after he dropped him had him in survival mode, Tyson didn’t care to try to be focused and land. He just wanted to survive till the end with faints, and throwing arm punches to try to keep Francis at bay. Then Francis landed several combos in the 8th round were he had Tyson looking exhausted and leaning all his weight on him to try to keep from falling over from being exhausted, Francis still landing a few short choppy hooks on the inside of those clinches, to end it off when any boxing fight is called “ CLOSE” always the difference in a fight factor is always the KNOCK DOWN factor that ends up winning the fight, funny how tonight the knockdown meant nothing in what was called a “CLOSE” fight. 🥊
Ngl I forgot about this fight
Can’t wait for Rocky 2 when Francis beat Tyson in the rematch.
Boxing is rigged.
Obvious Nganou won
That Elbow was BS
Tyson Fury lost this one
I feel like this more than validates Francis making the right decision to move away from MMA to pursue boxing. Regardless of the outcome of this fight, Tyson is an incredible boxer backed up by all of his career works, and Francis having the opportunity to not only gain experience by facing a great boxer, but walk away with a huge payday and enormous boost of confidence, should he feel eager to get back in the ring there will definitely be a draw to see him fight again. Congrats to both fighters.
Hellll noooooooooo!!!!! We got robbed again.
Fury lost ,
It's funny how all you casuals believe this fight was real 😂
Francis Ngannous just pulled a Rocky. Cheers up to him for accomplishing his dream to be a high-level boxer.
He look like he didn’t deserve that one.
The baddest man on the fucking planet FRANCIS
Boxing is a joke. You knew the judges were bought and paid for. Pathetic.
All you dummys who dont know shit about boxing. "Oh he knocked fury down! He won the fight!" Bro, he didnt win
This is what our world looks like, Tyson Fury as the heavyweight champion of the world…. Man !!!! I miss the old days !!!! This world sucks now, I thought it was supposed to get better
They won’t let no black man beat him no matter what 🤦🏽‍♂️
Fury a bum when he not taking PEDS
Mexican judge Juan Carlos Pelayo throws up some kooky cards. He gave Whyte 2 and 3 vs Fury.
Respect from a fan of both 💯💪🏿
Francis looked good wow didn't expect that, at least in these highlight without seeing the whole thing. He got robbed by the looks of it.
Draw
He knocked him down. He WON the fight. That wasn't close. He knocked him down! That should've tilted the decision in Francis favor. Whyte supremacy led decision.
what a pathetic preference from fury.
That elbow should have been deducted from Fury.
How? Francis got robbed haha
Smh. We know who gonna hurt tomorrow morning. I thought fury was supposed to destroy him  talked all that shit and only won by a point which is complete bullshit and they know it
Francis hit Fury behind the ear. That's every boxer's dream, because you're going down, no matter who you are.
Tyson didnt even train for that fight .... He spared a little an trained for like 3 weeks. Nganu been training for 6 mos already...even had Tyson train him. He just tried to catch the champ slacking an try an steal the belt real quick.... That was dead tyson saw that coming
That's ngannou's WIN!!!! Wow!!!
Francis won
boxing is rigged asf
Tyson F, to me has been a dirty boxer.. That elbow is not the first time he has used it. Francis did get robbed
Everybody know Tyson fury lost that fight😂
White washed
Jon Jones is not a champion UNTIL he beats Francis Ngannou.
Let me explain this fury gets knocked down? To build hype and $ for next fight . Then he fights nuganye for even bigger $ and Francis might get another big fight? This is so fixed I can’t believe people are believing this crap why do you think the got Mike Tyson involved the fight wasn’t selling
cheating twice is crazy…
Tyson fury said he could beat Ngannou in an MMA match after this I don’t think there’s a chance in hell he could pull that off
Fury deserves an Oscar
Clear robbery
Come on come on! That's all I have to say!
Fury is 🗑️
Francis started boxing before MMA. Good to see it come in
Fury definitely won that fight…
Wow
Never watching boxing again if u don’t want black people to win just say that cause Francis won
Francis won that.. I want to see Francis Vs wilder now
Francis won that
That’s some B.S
They robbed big guy
Lol everyone that's never fought before dragging Francis like he didn't just knock down one of the top boxers in the world right now in his first match lol
Mma fan girls mad because mma fighters don't have what it takes to beat a boxer. They can say in the cage an mma fighter will destroy a boxer. Yet mma fighters can't even beat a youtuber in a boxing ring. An mma fighter should have at least decent boxing skills since they're "mixed" martial artists, but they don't. mma fighters need to stop embarrassing themselves in stay in their trashy so-called sport.
Boxing is so corrupt
This is some bs ! A straight robbery and they wonder why no one buys boxing pps anymore the shit is staged
What a sht show by TF tonight!  He wasn't the killer that beat the hell out of Wilder twice and left him not all there.  Now he either took that bum that isnt a pro boxer and has no gas tank lightly or he was paid to go 10 rds and give the moneys worth for 50 million he got, pick one or choose both lol. Semper Fidelis
Now I really think if Mike Tyson fought Fury now Tyson would win.
This is laughable
Lmao people saying Dana White is crooked but boxing is literally the most corrupt sport out there and nobody says a peep.
NGANNOU 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
I'm still waiting for the day that Ngannou gets wobbled. Hard to beat a guy who has so much power and a granite chin. In an MMA match, you'd have to take him to the ground
Ngannou won that fight 6 to 4 plus the knockdown. At worse it was a 5 to 5 but he still wins because of the extra point for KD. Fury it seems has been overrated for a long time. Who did he really beat?? Wilder is a C+ fighter with an A+ right hand, Klitschko was 39 years old and was washed and all of the rest of his resume is very weak.This fight really exposed Fury's level.  He simply ain't that good!  Much respect to Ngannou...fighting as a boxer for the first time, inactive for 2 years and does this well. He should be champ. Terrible look on many levels for boxing and on Fury.
How did he not get him out of there
Francis clearly did more damage.
Robbed!!!!
You really paying games out here with us
It's really hard to tell but is this the worst shape Tyson Fury has been in the ring?? He looks more out of shape than ever.
Did he got hit with an elbow lol
Ngannou vs Jake Paul next! Let’s gooo! lol
Fury is ass bro 😭
So that mean’s ngannou can knock him out in ufc fight 😂ngannou won they just didn’t want his streak to be taken by ufc guy cause there “ not boxers”
Where are all of the "If Francis connects, Fury is going to sleep" crowd at? I want my money by this Monday 12pm PDT!
Fury is a joke
Good rigged fight for the fans
that was a dirty move by the gypsy fighter
For real that’s crazy
people actng like francis won because of that chuck wepner knockdown.
Amazing what Francis has been able to accomplish. Everyone wrote him off when he ditched UFC. This shows in life follow your dreams & never listen to those who say “ you” can’t do It. I’m inspired. Deep down Fury knows what time it is.
Francis did awesome for his first fight as a boxer even though he got robbed of that win
Robbed clearly whooped Fury’s azz!!
I like Fury, but I think he lost this one.
Francis has won the respect of millions. He is arguably the most naturally gifted athlete alive today.
Classic boxing robbery
Lol from these few highlights it clearly looks like Francis should have won. I did not see the whole fight, I really want to now.
This fight was so blatantly rigged that the saudi's were in the ring whispering shit in Francis' ears after the fight. They don't even care how shady this was because they already have people's money lmaaaaooo
Damn Francis looked really good out there. He has been the best boxer coming out of MMA aside from Anderson Silva.
Shame on judges
Tyson doesn't take boxing serious anymore and it showed
Maybe Uncle Dana should reconsider signing Ngannou after that performance, 4 months of training to fight the best heavyweight champion in boxing knocking him down & losing to what could arguably been a win for him maybe even a draw. Can’t wait to see Ngannou in the PFLs
Insane Ngannou took this supposed GOAT to a split decision
Wilder vs Ngannou next!
mma fans🤡 go practice your ground sex grappling with your boyfriends. bunch of 🏳‍🌈
Lol Francis got robbed. 😂
The Refs score each round. Now go back yourself and try to score each round, and come tell me where this was a robbery.. A draw at best. Excellent performance from a Francis against a world class fighter. Absolutely proud for someone is not a professional boxer. No excuse for Fury to not be in better shape even if it’s not the caliber of fighter he has in boxing. That’s why Mayweather stands out. This is not Fury’s best performance, but he definitely did enough for the win
Robbery!!
Fury definitely out boxed Francis but it was a awesome fight 💯🔥🤘💪
Francis won! Omg
Very disappointed by Tyson’s performance.  Huge Tyson Fury fan, and I know what he’s capable of and this was a let down..  Not sure if it was an off night, if he didn’t train well, or if he was out of shape... but we want to see something better when he faces Usyk.
His brother loss too to ksi
Heavyweight boxers aren't Heavyweight boxers anymore. Tyson Fury is pathetic.
If fury and Usyk fight it will be battle of the robbery championship because both fighters lost smh 😂😂🙄🤦🏽‍♂️
Knocked down in the past in boxing 🥊 meant a win 😮 Who agree 👍
Gonna be a great re match
Fucking robbery
This fight is exactly why boxing remains a terrible sport.  So much flashy rigged bullshit its ridiculous.  Every fight between two high profile fighters is always a fix
What a shitty fight. Props to Ngannou, though, I guess. Talk about anticlimactic…
That was 100% rigged
Sad😮😮😮😢
The world can agree francis was robbed
"Can you say "Robbery" kids?" [In my Mr. Rodgers voice,]
They always robbed the black
These are the most biased highlights ever.  They only show what happened in round 3 5 and 8. Fury won ever round but maybe 3
There's no doubt in my mind that elbow was 100% intentional. Fury been practicing thos.
That’s crazy
Don't know if that was an intentional "dirty" elbow, but it was clearly a foul. Respect Fury for even taking this fight though. He's a very courageous fighter. He has endurance that many other fighters do not have along with a will to continue through adversity. I like all that about Fury even though his wild antics are annoying sometimes.
FURY LOST.
Welcome to pro boxing Francis.  Now go get your rematch and make even more money.
Fury landed more
I'm not surprised, Francis got a knock down. But I am surprised he lasted the whole fight.
Terrible highlight video.  Thankfully i’ve never given a dime to ESPN my entire life and never will.
Fury won the fight but it was a lot closer than it should have been. Like Francis almost won the decision close. He definitely didn’t take this fight seriously and Francis put on a masterful performance. I’d love to see a rematch.
Fury is a fraud, Boxing is a fraud!

Fury lost this one
FRANCIS WON EVERY ROUND & DROPPED FURY. THIS WAS RIGGED !!
Fury looks so damn out of shape.
Fixed fight
Hahaha I thought Francis didn’t stand a chance
Now I see why Bones Jones been ducking Ngannou. Fury better thank his maker it was a right hook
Fury def didnt take this fight seriously and didnt train. He looked out of shape.
Tyson Fury: gets his ass beaten up = wins  Ngannou: beats him up and gets elbowed = loses   What the...? How?
Bro that elbow don’t face him since he use to it but jeeezzzz others would of folded to that elbow
Total bs Francis won that fight what a monster
This is not the kronx style fury
I keep telling you they not going to let a blk guy win. They cheated 2 great Blk fighters out of a win with this fat YT fake. Boxing game is not fair anymore.
Mma fighters don’t go to boxing and do this. He deserves a rematch. He won
And this is why the heavyweight division is a joke.
Compared to Tyson’s face and Francis face, Tyson looked like he lost. Congrats to both
So there basically were no highlights 😂
Disgusting robbery
MMA gloves homie is in the gypsy shadow realm.
If this was an MMA match, Fury would be in the hospital after Francis knocked him down.  Heck, Fury elbowed Francis as hard as he could in the face and Francis acted like he didn't even notice it lol.
That's nuts
I wonder if jake paul will call out ngannou😂
Fury is on his way out
lol Boxing is a joke lol lol
They robbed francis
Now the ufc match Tyson fury don't have the men in him to step in the UFC embarrassing
FRANCIS CLEARLY WON THIS FIGHT !!!
U guys saw them Dubai niggas this shit was fixed
Francis should have won that, dude can be real special with more training in the boxing industry
Usyk will destroy this dude.
I love Fury, I am a fan if his.  But he lost this fight period.
Thanks!
This fight was so rigged....Francis won and in dominant fashion...just being honest.
Yes the elbow wow should have been a point deduction
No way. Francis won that. Rigged. Now imagine those bunches with mma gloves on. He’s got N insane ground games too. Tyson lost
Fury definitely lost
Boxing has officially become garbage
Francis won.  But the money already invested in Fury/Usyk.  No way Francis was gonna get decision.
I don’t get boxing but if dat was a street fight Francis won wtf I don’t get it he knocked em down
That knockdown punch on Fury didnt seem that strong.
Tyson fury is playing this fight.   He is trying to fool usyk into believing he is easy target.
Francis really walked off that elbow like he didn’t felt shit
Rigged
Fury throwing elbows. Figures, he's a dirty fighter
Fury as a man and a professional knows Ngannou whipped his ass
I'm a gypsy I'm supposed to root for Tyson but Francis  whooped that ass 😂😂😂
Francis was robbed… simple
Francis won but you know, boxing 🤷🏻‍♂️
Robbery.. Francis is my Champion
Robbery
Ngannou has taken a much more cerebral approach to fighting in general..when he beat Stipe Miocic, it showed his evolution from a slugger to something more methodical, and it has helped in this fight..Not only that, but is just a physical freak...He could do really well in boxing if he wants to
I'm in disbelief Francis didnt win Wtf I like fury but look at his face and look at Francis!! smdh shit dont make sense!!
Francis ate that elbow lol
I wish they made overtime rounds so they can fight to the bitter end!!!
Wow. I'm shocked. Francis did WAY better than I expected. I was wrong. Well done Francis.
Way better fight then the logans
Nag won that
Francis clearly lost he’s mid
Fury lost LOOK AT HIS DAMN FACE, he lost but you know they don’t want boxing to die down knowing a ufc fight fame and beat a boxers ass, they rigged it because Francis should’ve had more point’s especially from the knockdown smh
Im shocked that Francis didn't gas out in the later rounds? He obviously trained well for the fight and took it seriously and it showed but Tyson still won the fight.
The man pulled off Rocky twice! In MMA and in boxing
Tf did I just watch. Francis is a literal anomaly. He won this fight.
Disgraceful, another nail in the coffin of boxing!  Thanks Tyson for shiting on john l Sullivan,  Dempsey,  louis , etc.
Boxing is the most corrupt, negligent sport in the world. Fury simply didn’t win that fight, period.
This is where black people have f"ed up. Anytime a white person beats a black person in boxing, either the white person cheated are the black person was robbed. The race card has been played out! Even if it is actually true, the boy who called wolf is no longer believed by anyone!!!!!!!
Goes to show you that Fury is mediocre. Francis wouldn’t have lasted with old school fighters.
Rematch!
I’m a furry fan always have been but man fucking Francis man he showed up tonight and furry did not
Who landed more?
Tyson fury is a giant
robbery
Francis is my favorite fighter....ever
Smfh. Cant stand boxing. How he won🤦🤷‍♂️
Fury out of shape wilder can come get his belts back at this point
This proves that Mike Tyson knows how to train fighters
Francis got robbed but we all knew that was going to happen bcuz he wasn't supposed to win.
Francis won.
Francis got robbed, wow!
Francis got ROBBED with out a gun
Am I a good rapper? Music on my page let me know
Somewhere out there, Alistair Overeem is smiling 😂
Trump called Francis "They stole from you aswell brother"
Set up the boxing commission wasnt gonna let fury lose but fury lost that match
Fury wanted a vacation fight and he pretty much got it
Massive respect for that one judge that was honest. That second judge that didn't give Francis any points can go piss off! This right here r signifies that Francis is the toughest guy ever not only did he win this fight in my opinion he also is one of the top MMA guys and fury can't fight a welterweight.
Thats a lie
They fixed that result
Robbery
A total robbery
Tyson furry lost hands down
He got robbed!
This is unreal, that elbow would of knock any boxer out. Francis is a fucking killing machine
Super mad respect to Francis !! He did great!!!
Can’t tell if this was a huge troll job by Fury or judging by his weight he didn’t care
We need a rematch. Francis is a top heavyweight boxing contender. He shocced the world.
I hope he keep training with mike tyson
You see how dirty fury fights, trust he did that glove scam on  wilder that fight
Fury did NOT expect them punches to be that strong 🤣
With that, they say he lost, that's  racism
WHAT THE FUCK
Francis was robbed
ESPN bias 2 minute highlight to make francis the winner .. what happened to the oyher rounds that tyson won?
Francis true fighter..... Respect this man wait till his next fight...! Opponents going to sleep!!!!
Clown shoes
Welp,  there goes boxing, is there anything fair in this world??????I'm done.
Robbed
Props to Mike Tyson for training Ngannou. Because I thought that it would've been better if he had trained with either MAYWEATHER jR OR SENIOR
Robbbed.
Francis was robbed
Rigged as fuk wbc couldnt let their so called best heavyweight champ in recent years to get beat by a dude from ufc fighting his first boxing match its so obvious francis won how can a judge score 96-93 favor of fury huh make that make sense!!!
That was all the highlights? Musta been a boring fight
How you get dropped and still win…
WHAT A STORY!. From Collecting Dirt, To UFC, To Loosing His Coach For The Best Of Him, To Becoming UFC Champion, To Leaving The UFC, To a Title Money Fight Vs Fury, And Loosing By 1 Point, Amazing.
Wow - Francis gonna get more fights
Ngannou got robbed 😡!
Not only does this prove that Francis is not bad at boxing at all, but that Iron Mike should start coaching and become someone like D’Amato. He’s probably the only one on earth that can teach the peek a boo style effectively. It’s extremely underused and I really wanna see it more in pro fights.
That man is a beast
A lot of you counted Ngannou out. He did better than any other opponent fury had. Ngannou should've won that from the knock down alone!
Yeahhhhhh Ngannou did NOT win that fight lol
Cheat
Rigged 😂
Elbow should have been a point deduction, shouldn't it?
Sucks that he “lost” but I’m happy Francis got a huge payday. Made more than his entire UFC career.
Rigged
Clearly the judges were gonna give Fury the win no matter what unless he got knocked out cold..
look in Tyson's eyes before the decision and that tells you all you want to know - great fight
Much Respect, Much Love, for Our Brother Francis. Truly an outstanding Job.
Damn he got rob 😢 ... Connections Connections 👎....
I understand why Fury won, and not even Francis is mad at that, he know too lol! IM JUST GLAD MY BOY GOT PAID! And he probably LOVES the recovery time after a boxing fight hahaha. Wouldn’t be surprised is we see Francis on another Fury card as the co main! What a wonderful match between to awesome guys!
Ngannou knock down of Fury was the perfect reason for a rematch and the fighters getting even bigger bags of cash. I don't get it.
Rigged  just like sports betting now days. 🗑
That's cute Francis really thought he won should have been unanimous decision
They don’t want an African King to be champion😂
Book Wilder vs Ngannou next. Power vs power
Boxers are just going to fix their fights for him francis is way too strong
Tyson is lucky that in boxing, a fighter gets an opportunity to get back on his feet after a knockdown.
What a robbery
Francis u are now a Legend
Damn where those fury gonna kill Francis fans. 😂
Vegas definitely made a call to the judges. They would have lost hundreds of millions if Francis won cause so many people were betting in his favor against huge odds. Robbery
Francis Nngonnu got ROBBED!!!
Francis got robbed
Pathetic
Fury threw an big elbow!! It didn’t faze Francis!
If that doesn't wake Tysons overweight azz up nothing will. He better get in better shape for Usyk and start keeping his hands up
If this is Ngannou's first boxing match and he does this well, look out everyone! This man is gonna wreck some heavyweights! He's not a small guy either, and he has knockout power!? Just wait till he hones his skills and harnesses that power in the correct way!
Fury got beat up 😂😂😂😂🎉
The true baddest man on the planet title belongs to the winner of Jones vs. Ngannou if it ever happens.
Francis won
Dana white should have paid this guy he messed up bad Jon jones would lose so bad
Bro biggest robbery bro!! Fuck boxing ..
So knockout don't count when u fight fury ? 😂😂 Bro lost that fight
I'm shocked at how well Nganou did. Good for him
Robbery
Francis won the whole world knows
ngannou won that figh tyson was grabbing him at some points trying to take him down and he elbowed him
Scrub after scrub against the Paul's and then we get this and big brother botches it. Boxing and MMA are just so fucked right now. Can't get out of their own way let alone cross brands.
HOW DOES TYSON WIN I DONT GEY IT BRO GOT KNOCKED DOWN AND THREW AN ILLEGAL ELBOW 😱
Sorry Tyson your a monster but Ngannou won and Boxing didn’t want to look bad so the politics got involved sad!
Lol dats dat power John jones Neva felt
That’s bullshit needs to be investigated.  Foh you cheating mfers.
He couldn’t weigh bully Francis cuz of the MMA training  This was a Robbery  I’m disappointed in Tyson
I didnt get to watch the full fight, so does anyone know if tyson got points deducted for the elbow??
Francis robbed wtf??
Congrats for Francis for your WIN
ROBBERYYY
Lol I knew it
I actually thought Tyson was going to actually win but in my eyes he lost this fight. U could see it in Francis face how he knew he won. Francis definitely won this fight
Boxing people know they can't let a MMA fight just walk in and become Heavy Weight Champ! Francis is truly the badest man on planet 🤙🏾💪🏽👊🏾
Wow!!!!
Francis won that fight
Robery
Francis Ngannou was robbed on this one
Highway robbery how the duck did fury win wat was they watching
Fuk boxing. I will NEVER spend another dollar on anything boxing. It is the most corrupt sport in the history of the world. Hey boxing fans, come over to MMA where things are a lot more legit. Boxing is obviously rigged. Don't spend another dollar on this crap
That  elbow Tyson throws should of been a. DQ
It’s uncle miiiiiiike next time it follow through it’s uncle Mikecwith thOSE
Straight up robbed him
i give francis ngannou all my respect for the way he handled this shit
Great win for Francis. Glad anyone with two eyes can see that. All the best to him and his team.
Mad respect to Francis regardless of what the judges decided. That man just keeps shocking everyone with his resilience & perseverance. His life story is truly amazing & inspirational.
Fury will go nowhere near usyk after this trash of a performance. Francis thanks for making Us believe in our dreams! #weareafricans#
Boxing is dead and has been for decades. Tyson fury is a total joke, he shouldn't even be a ranked fighter yet he is the "champion".
Buddy buddy this fight was rigged like a tuna bait
Man they just cheated him like that
The fury protection plan is crazy
all I can say is wow... the judges... Francis won hands down. Not even close, wtf...
Robbery
I can see why Tyson fury ducked uysk 😂

We know who really won that fight 🤨✊🏿
Yeah idk about that one lol Gypsy king got rocked while Francis looked like he just walked in the ring lol
I’ve never thought of a scripted match until I saw these two body language
Fury should ne ashamed of himself fighting non boxers while being active champ then he didnt win the fight what a joke
You see Tyson face compared to Francis? One got beat up JS. It’s like baseball, tie goes to the runner and by tie, I mean coming down to a decision. Like Dana always says, never leave it in the hands of the judges🤷‍♂️  Let’s see them both in a cage fight next 😂😂😂. My money says it won’t go to a decision!
Run that shit back
Wow how they rob the black man 🤦🏾‍♂️ Fury is trash 🗑️ lol
i saw no highlights from tyson, how did he win?
Stolen mandate! What a shame! Francis Nganou is the 👑 of our 💕.
The moment I seen it was going to a decision I knew Francis wasnt gonna get the win sadly. He did better than a lot of people thought he would and he got the win tonight regardless of what any paid off judge says.
Francis won man this is why I switched to mma boxing is to money driven
Come on gee Dont rob bro like That Francis Got that man face lookin worse then i ever seen
Francis is a beast,he won hands down. For a first time,i think he did extremely fantastic 👏
Rigged!!!

Have I been under a rock? How did I not know this was happening today? Promo sucked ass for this fight. They dropped the ball big time
If it were a split decision I think Francis should have one just because of the knock down .and that elbow that fury threw .don't get me wrong I like fury but that elbow was a dirty move .
tyson fury ain’t no damn boss his bitch ass lost yet they give him the win after elbowing the opponent and getting knocked down, them racist pussy’s should be ashamed of themselves all of em, we know deep down y’all really afraid
Tyson L, Fury.
Arabs to Ngannou…You won Don’t worry will pay you.
We should be pissed tbh Francis just got robbed In our face 🤦🏾‍♂️💯
