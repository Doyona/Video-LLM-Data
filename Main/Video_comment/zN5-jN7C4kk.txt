HIS DAD GOT A BOMB FOR CHRISTMAS😱😱😱😱😱😱🙊🙊🙊🙊💔💔😭😭😭😭✨✨
Draw a face after his death is crime bro
He was about 70 years old or more when he died(well i think) heres how i found out,whem he got his first car, i found the exact one on google and said it was from the 70s,i googled how old you'll need to be to drive ur first car and it where i live you need to be about 16,so he would be 16 in 1970 or around that time, and so i added it up to 2024 wich is when this video was made and it equalled 54,and so 16+54 is 70,so thats how i found out hes around 70 or more
Dam you are so beautiful resting on the ground  so beautiful 😭
Como que lo tradujiste a español

The reason why you die is because your lungs cannot lived up long for 98 years to 100 years old then you get a heart attack then you'll die and that's how you die from old age

...
The people at his funeral were smiling
Yo….. you know          Ohio Boss
George dead just ellie Fredericksen and her wife shelby is still ok just like carl Fredericksen
George is writing all of his experiments
A
The whole story is just...   wow! It is funny, it is action-packed, and most fundamentally, it is so emotional and heartwarming.  The life experiences that George went through: Adopted a dog pet Celebrated Halloween, Christmas, Thanksgiving and a Star Wars themed birthday Party Started to learn to drive with the help and guidance of his father Graduated from High School Met the girl of his dreams and got married Travelled around the world with his wife Found a house where George and his wife can stay and where his parents can visit him from time to time Became a navy soldier, saved his men and the world from a zombie apocalypse and received his medal for his bravery Have children of their own and spent their own golden years together When George got very old, he wrote a book all about his life experiences Finally, he died of a heart attack and at the funeral, all of his friends, comrades, children, grandchildren and other people gathered around to honor his memory  Now, I guess that whoever discovered George's diary about his life experiences, will get to learn from them and make the best of his/her life.

Hypnosis is a human condition involving focused attention, reduced peripheral awareness, and an enhanced capacity to respond to suggestion. There are competing theories explaining hypnosis and related phenomena. Wikipedia
I don't like the sad ending
George has so much good luck sorry I forgot his name
I think you should have built George coming to his wifes funeral as a ghost and them in heaven
Pls make a dinosaur park
That game is game of life
That game is game of life
Totally relatable
Respect ❤
Awesome story
My god, it goes from being happy and with a home to brutally killing zombies to survive in 2 seconds
Even a zombie came to his funeral... Wow🫡 wat a life😍
Lego lore
Trending baby 😮
I watched someone’s whole life story in 9 minutes… I miss George. RIP
I like how the story went from a sweet, family home to a zombie apocalypse in 1 second
Dam grandpa does the trippy 360 on a pie

You had to spoil it @HMDbrickcustoms
George got that W rizz
Bro shoes during the wedding he got the Chi Chi iota

what about the dog?
Why is his dad holding a piece of dynamite and look the snow globes and I thought you was going to drop it
after 7:02 things were getting strange lol
Bro what happened to George’s dog
How about you build every sports including baseball and all the stuff
It honestly sucks that in our country Indonesia we dont celebrate Halloween and althouht we do celebrate Christmas, theres no snow, which also sucks. Althought couldn't agree more that Halloween and (or) christmas are the most important memory's of youre life
Idky I feel so attached to george
Did he just use the BFDI mouth? 0:07
I love how you plan and think . So creative . One of my favorite Lego people on here .
Duck: BFDi mouth oh dear 0:08
This is so beautiful it brought a tear to my eye.
Did anyone else see that “obi wan tano” (3:25)

Why was George's dad holding a stick of dynamite on Christmas?
Please do another one.
Why did the dad have dynamite 😐
2:14 I like the girl minifigure with the bonnet
Want abt a dog house 😢
RIP George he was a good man😢😢😢
Can you make a Lego video of you making the entire armies of the skibidi toilet and the cameramen because it's the most popular series in youtube and we would love to see you build that.
Oh no George is hurt 😢 :(
I liked that it actually shows his entire life from birth to death but why the apocalypse
They bought a house and we’re a happy family, then there was a zombie apocalypse
B
Dude what the hell my eyes actually started watering up at the end
Ayo this is me
the bfdi mouths lol
Bro the where those  dog alive  when he die
I have the game life and it’s called the game of life
The story is great but the zombie apocalypse? Ok I didn't know life could do that
Funny how I got a ad at 4:01
EYO WHY DA DAD HAVE A BOMB
I think you did someone that dies in a red dead redemption two mission in chapter 6 (my last boy)
that one guy smiling at georges funeral
It’s really funny to me that he dies just like Don Corleone, minus the little kid laughing at him
Do you know that zombies are not real?
What an AMAZING story!

Did you notice that the house that was in the Halloween event is the same one in the thanksgiving event😂😂😂😂
The zombie apocalypse is a nice way to avoid the boring part where you have to get a job and pay your taxes soooooo boring 😂 I like how you use things from your previous videos such as the horror tree like the one in the goosebumps cover
This video really shows how short yet beautiful life can be
I like how this video just came out yet. It’s already on TikTok.
George has a concussion and Shelby is just smiling like lol
Part 2 with his kids please 🙏
Finally a zombie apocalypse where the military isn’t useless
HOW DID THE DOGS SURVIVE FOR LIKE 80 YEARS
Lego mouth bfdi
Is it bad i crying
"After they moved in, a zombie apocalypse broke out across the country and George was drafted into the military as a jeep driver" That is the most out of pocket thing I've heard so far💀💀💀💀

3:35 deadass hits home for me, I have so many memories of my friends all just coming over during my party and we’d all spend the night playing the new game I just got. What I wouldn’t give to go back
Plz bring back goosebumps
I like that george is basically living the platonic ideal of a middle-class american life
2:09 why do you think it’s called cream pie?

George, the definition of a hero 🫡🥺
I love this evolution - a story of a LEGO Minifigure’s life. 👍
I cried at that last part💀
That is what life is all about nothing but death war And love we all must live life to the fullest because you may never know when your time in this world will come the an end    Abraham Ps Never give up on yourself
Rip George he was a Great man
Good story
And one day George was walking and died. Thanks for watching and see you later. Lol such a quick ending
Was really hoping for a build of George paying his taxes, but this was _such_ a beautiful story of all the fun moments we can all look back on/look forward to :)

Using trenches in a zombie apocalypse seems like a very dumb idea
