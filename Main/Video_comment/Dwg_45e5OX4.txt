As someone learning spanish, he did an amazing interview in english
You always explain things so well.
Su peor album despues de “Estas no iban a salir”
Guys, let’s just get Guermo to interview him with subtitles
It feels like home because New York Ricans  Nothing else
I thought he couldn't speak English
You’re an amazing creator.
Great job, keep it up.
The intro hooked me instantly.
Exactly.
Al Pacino …….❤
Bad Bunny has a new Black girlfriend with dreadlocks Knock them ads out the box ,Bad Bunny🤣😒😂😂🤣
IDC Taylor dances to everyone HAHHAHAHAHAHAHA
Sublime
I knew bad bunny from like 3 years ago but I never got a chance to song to his music because well I'm from Asia, latin music isnot really what we used to play. Anyway then I found DTMF and I was like move. As someone who prefer visual memory than taking more picture with my closest people made me think 'oh you know what he is right, we should take more photos' and the rest of the album is TOP NOTCH. I also learn Spanish a little bit like from 2 years ago it's so on and off. Now I have more reason to learn Spanish, just to get understand everything about him
TE AMO CABRON ❤❤❤❤❤
5:05
I love his laugh ❤
Why is he hiding his eyes?
Mr. Beneto Antonio Martinez  Ocasio, in the Month of December 2024 I  purchased a airline ticket from Fronteer Airlines  at the Philadelphia airport to  your Island of Puerto Rico and was planning  to stay a month when I  got news of a electrical black out that lasted most of the month. I canceled the flight lost $315 no refund just a flight credit. I am fighting with Fronteer to get a credit on my Debit card and it is 23  March 2025. I'm a retired  CWA union member  and don't like to give my $ away. I saw you with Jimmy Fallon several times, a very funny guy on his show and videos of you 2 on my YouTube.  Happy Easter Bunny from Rockledge Florida
Very sexy.
He is so handsome 😍¡ que guapo puertorriqueño
I never saw Jimmy kissing ass like that.
Él se hace.. él sabe inglés🐰
It’s so obvious this is Aaron Hernandez
He’s so hot - some people have everything 🥰🥰🥰
BAD BUNNY IS GARBAGE; A NO TALENT BUM. WHAT A JOKE. NOT UNLIKE CRAP DOG, OR SNOOP DOG. POPULAR DON'T MEAN TALENTED. SADHAM HUSSEIN VIDS HAD MILLIONS OF LIKES; DOES THIS MEAN HE WAS PRAISED, TOO? WHAT ABOUT USAMA BINLADEN, OR EVEN HITLER....
He loved getting the diddy
Diddled
I don't like his music but he is a great comedian!
Let it allllllllll out.... 🍆
I think he just needs to speak in WHATEVER language makes him comfortable. He is so intelligent and has so much to say. We can all just translate, right? ❤
What the FÚČĶ does he says when singing in spanish 😂
4571_&-+57
When he speaks in English he loses all of his charisma
Es el tio Bad Bunny
Humans are obsessed with stupid shit. yes music is good but the fact ppl scream over answers over humanbeings just shows how stupid life is.
“… I can’t speak Spanish so I can’t really don’t…” 😂😂😂 Bad bunny doesn’t even speak good Spanish..😂
You can tell he feels a bit uncomfortable speaking English 😢 it’s a shame that he has to learn English to speak it in interviews why don’t other people learn how to understand Spanish, unless you already speak it like myself and many others
hes just a nobody in non-spanish world.
I love it babe.. You were awesome.. Remember the fly babe..😂😂
His accent is so MEOW❤
STUDIO 54
Guy got zero good song and still popular af. The dumb liberal culture is stoopit and this clown needs immediate deportation.
Aww loved seein my soulmate...such a treat on somehin I've never seen before...❤ Beautiful energy ❤
Anyone can be famous 😂😂😂
Es un rasgo autista de las angloparlantes dar por supuesto que es el idioma natural de todo el mundo 😅
bad bunny say "hello" the public : ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I'm 62, and I would love to take a "Bad Bunny Class!" I have watched him grow as an artist and a beautiful young man. ❤ I think Latino men and women are the most gorgeous people on the planet!
I think he’s doing well with the English he knows. Probably nerve wrecking, but you can tell Bad Bunny doesn’t have confidence in his English. Peso Pluma interview is awesome.
He’s so handsome 😍😍😍
Good bless benito❤💙🤍🔟
I Wonder what he speaks with kendall Jenner
Excremento, decadencia, involucion...
Amazigh!! He speaks better English than Spanish. Cervantes would die again listening to his Spanish 😅
Even if he knows English so good, the problem is that obviously he can not be himself cause he is thinking in Spanish, so please make your guest comfortable, us they need to learn English you also can add subtitle or you can even learn Spanish. Benito we love you from Europa 🎶🍸🫶
Great video
Dude seems arrogant
Wackest int ever, BB was a good sport
May he continue to be this humble. He’s shyness is such a strength.❤️
❤ I love this babe,, I seen everything.. Congrats... I love you my love
I like that he is pushing himself out of the comfort zone and learning more the other language. Id like to do that with french.
Bad bunny smile 😍😍😍
finally A video where people dont destroy Bad Bunny with the comments
Lol nobody knows  hope he got all he wanted 😂 Because now he is canceling his shows due to not selling not even the 60% of tickets for his concerts
What a humble beautiful human 💞
Dewey sal de ahi, esa no es tu familia.
Orgullo Boricua...if he needs me to travel and interpret for him....let's go...
I am sorry but what a dumb interview. Does he really has that IQ level?  Or is he only nervous to speak english?
This guy listen to Azenavour songs, 😮 " He sampled Hier encore j'avais 20 ans "
La música cautiva y cautiva al oyente.
What a hack
Watch his entrance from WWE Backlash 2023, that was epic
Horrible shit people call music
🇵🇷🇵🇷 YHLQMDLG 🇵🇷🇵🇷😊💋😊💋❤️🙏💋
Dude, could you let your guests talk?  Can't stand Jimmy Fallon.
✈️  NO BREAKING TO HEAVEN! “ “
Why people are clapping after everything he says? It so freaking weird.
Is he slightly retarded ?
I love that he goes in and out of the two languages in his interview and Jimmy doesn't even blink about it. I also like that he seems to see people as people whether they are a celebrity dancing or his fans, or rather prefers the fans. Putting PR on the map for real!
For me i dont get the success this guy has. He obviously is not the smartest guy, he seems quite slow and i dont mean his english. Besides  keeping that cap on all the time is disrespectfull, the short answers....he seems bored. Whatever. The fact that he has so much succes reiterates the fact that the world is becoming dumb. Good luck. This world is going to 💩
Orgullo 🇵🇷❤️🙏
i saw him in bullet train but tbh he's ogs in this younger youths.
Too much cussing
It's great that Jimmy Fallon is giving him a platform, but it is obvious that he really isn't that familiar with el Conejo Malo.
PYPL
“Aww, look.” 1:33
Se nota que bad tomo clases de ingles con kendal, ha mejorado mucho su actitud ante hablar en ingles
la era de la basura musical ha llegado
He is soo cute 🥰 and he is so shy 🙈 but he learning how to speak English good for him
Who the fuck is that interviewer gay?
I didn't like this interview. He should be able to speak comfortably en espanol with live translators for his own comfort. I especially didn't like when he asked him to translate the name of his album into english knowing he is not 100% fluent. And when he(bad bunny) was speaking spanish, the CC literalamente dice  (speaking spanish). They didn't  even bother to translate it. It's so rude and disrespectful. Te amo, bad bunny. Tu eres muy guapo y mereces más respeto. yo te amo tu musica.
This man😍😍😍
He’s so hot
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥!!!!!!
No me equivoco es x
Jimmy's fake laughs etc are cringe
Jimmy should go back to acting or snl for a bit, i think he's loosing touch with his performer artist self!!! Bad bunny is awesome. Some of the questions though were eh! Cmon Jimmy give us some more flare bud! Go bb!
nazario stones
🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
It's called "nobody knows what's going to happen tomorrow"...except he just said his fans knew the album was going to come out? Jajaja
Al Pacino 🙌🏽
in his music video WHERE SHE GOES at the end of the video there was a billboard that said " NADIE SABE..." and people think that was a hint towards something
Learn English Bad Bunny!! Por favor tienes que aprender mejor!!
Vendo tamales 🫔
TheHelpGroup, Alien C. I. A INTERROGATION KGB mhmmmm yum:)😊😊😊😊😊.
Fuck, he’s so hot and legendary
Man he seems hella down to earth. His English has also gotten a lot better. I remember when he first got big his English was super broken but he’s learning and it’s cool to see him to mix the English and Spanish. And hosting SNL??? That’s fire, just love seeing him have all this success.
Bien bien bien
BOBOLON
Its so hot how he keeps pulling his pants from his crotch to get comfortable, someone open the window 🪟 in here 🥵 his sexy is incredible👅👄😹😹😹😹😹
ll L v e y o u Bby 🩷 🙏🏻 🇮🇩 🥹 🙏🏻 🇮🇩
It was kris Jenner
A las generaciones se les da la música q se adapta a su mente 😂
Is he on coke? His chin is moving weirdly🤨
Que bello nuestro Bad❤Orgullo Boricua.        EL INIGUALABLE!!!🧑‍🦱❤️🙏👋😘🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Trash ass album honestly that one AI song shits on his whole album and that's why he was fuming 😂
Cuanto le pagaste al pacino? Te costo un poquito pero te valió la pena. Buena canción.
🗑️🚮
I love that Jimmy gives international artists the floor to speak in their native languages - nobody else here in the US today would do that! Music is universal❤️
Y’all don’t understand Bad bunny speaking Spanish and Benito speaking English are TWO different people ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂
He needs to learn English!😂
Alguien póngale un traductor y que hable en español solamente porque la entrevista está bien pinche aburrida con su ingles de primaria.
Deammmm.. bad bunny looks like a snack love how he is dressed
lo amo pero que mal ingles tiene.............jajajaja ......... de ser asi que mejor solo hable en español
Why are the audience screaming… he’s just a person
He doesn't even know how to speak spanish,  no matter what anyone says!!!!😂
Al Pacino su tío?? .. 🧐😯 Neta???... O es broma?..
No speak english??? Really 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂Clawn 😂😂😂
Go, Bad Bunny represents.
He’s so yummy
Este cantante diabólico q horror
Nobody listens his music in PR
que tipo mas antipatico sin gracia, me cae pero FATAL
AND BB And MARCELO HERNANDEZ SHOULD HAVE BABIES!!!!!😝🤣🤣🤣❤️‍🔥🔥🙌🏼
Being famous just because being Puerto Rican!! Garbage music his lyrics make no sense at all !! He only express sexual immorality and Godless persona, is a truly disrespectful act to have this brainless music so kids can listen to this and had a wrong perspective of life values!!! Totally unacceptable the Lord will punish America soon along with Haiti Dominican Republic Puerto Rico and Cuba, whose countries are full of iniquity and sexual immorality, wormwood is approaching and who will be able to stand that day!!! The day of the Lord will destroy most America continent
This guy had one of the busiest years ever. He was everywhere & doing everything. Including successfully wrestling in the WWE.
Such a strange interview.
Míralo el Bad Bunny todo cocky
Man so crazy to see how far he’s come since 2016
If you could understand the words in his albums you would be disgusted. He graphically talks about sexual themes and devalues the woman like no other artist ever did. Only people with no morals or sense of values of relationships are the one who promotes him.
❤❤❤
If a woman behaved and talked like bad bunny her career would be over… he’s lucky he can be himself and not get canceled lol
Baby bunny is a hoot! Talented, sweet and cute!
❤❤❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Honestly, I don't not how this guy has gone too far without talent!  In his songs, he just says nonsense, and barbarities. Women are mistreated by his lyrics. Definitely,  No talent, and no good voice. The worst is that many young people follow him.
No gum chewing during interview please.
He’s so fine 🥰😛
He has weird looking to me
Puerto Rico Lo Hace Mejor 😎💪🇵🇷🏝🔥                        Bad Bunny
Why dont they have his grammy performance on youtube? I cant find the link. Thats some bs. Any1 can help me find it?
I can be bad bunny's translator
🇵🇷💙🇵🇷❤️🇵🇷🤍🇵🇷♥️🇵🇷💙🇵🇷 Bud bunny👌
BB's English has improved so much! Buen trabajo compa - let's gooooo!!!
✨BAD BUNNY!!💜💚💛💙❤️_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
que cosa mas bonita que eres benito
Perdonnnnn
Fun fact: He doesn't like Colombians (e.g. Karol G, J. Balvin) because he sees them as Puerto Rican wannabees. This is how he feels about all Latin Americans doing reggaeton that aren't from PR. I would stop supporting this guy, have some respect for yourselves.
☝️🥰😘
Bad Bunny makes great music. I don't know what he's saying, lol, but his voice/music are great
Never know that tomorrow takes from you🎶 damn it I think everybody will understand
Nobody Knows What's Gonna Happen Tomorrow  Amazing Show
Even Jimmy Fallon gets turned on when he speaks Spanish
Lo siento algo subido ahora 😞
He came off arrogant in this interview
That's why kids are Stupid
Como odio esas 3 viejas que gritan cada pendejada q dice bad bunny ...
KBRONNN BAD BUNNY ES LEYENDAAA SE LO TIENEN QUE MAMAR
Grande Bad Bunny
❤❤
Because because this is his first language in Spanish God bless you Bad Bunny❤ ✌😇🇺🇸✌😇💋From Florida❤
SI SUFRES DE DEPRESION Y ANSIEDAD O TIENES UN VICIO QUE NO PUEDES DEJAR,PIDELE AYUDA A JESUCRISTO AHI MISMO DONDE ESTAS HAZLO CON TODO TU CORAZON 🙏Y EL TE AYUDARA, ARREPIENTETE DE TUS PECADOS HAZLO
Mi conejito Malo💋💋💋💋💋
I'll give it to him, his english has come leaps and bounds since he first rose to fame. At first he arguably didn't speak english at all.
Wtf are the ticket prices for this tour? How are we supposed to afford seeing bad bunny and paying rent or fucking buying food. BENITO DO SOMETHING!!
wow no anybody can sing what a shame what happen to music...a disaster singer
I think it would nice for people to know that we, Puerto Ricans, speak both English and Spanish, that we are US Citizens, that we are a Commonwealth of the United States 🇺🇸 and that we abide by the United State of America’s constitution. Bad Bunny is an American artist. He is also Hispanic. Puerto Ricans are Hispanic Citizens of the USA but, as opposed to those of Central and South Americans countries we are citizens from birth! And that is what make us unique from the rest!
Este tipo es realmente original
dicen que sale con Kendall, le habla en español o que onda? jajaja
His English omg ❤❤❤❤
I love that there were no Kendall Jenner questions
His music is pure trash, no real voice, horrible lyrics
DE LO PEORSITO QUE HAN INVITADO
🐇
it’s said there are more Puerto Ricans in New York than anywhere else in the United States. Benito🇵🇷New York could be your second home.🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
Bad Bunny is arrogant and he is overrated.  I foresee him having a tragic ending like Freddie Prince.
Weird Interview. Had bad bunny taken something before the interview😅
Was he like this? so handsome☺️
Que bueno verlo sin tanta morisqueta en la cara y vestido normal ahora solo le falta limpiar su musica.
Love bad bunny not you
One of the greatest music artist to be with us and we’re getting to listen to a legend in the works.
Holding it down, dropping a few Spanish bars, reminding them about the culture bravado that everyone loves in his music.  Seems like a easy humble guy. Claps vigorously for the rest of the people involved in the show.
Thanks to Kandelaria he is there sitting on that chair🤣😂
Bad,Bunny,speak,Good,English..and Spanglish..😅😅😅😅,He,Look,like..What??😅😅😅😅Benito,Actua,bien.Nice,Show,!!😇✌
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The album should be called... no one understands what this guy is singing in the songs because the lyrics seem like they were written by 10-year-olds.
Es una pena que después de tantas entrevistas en ingles no trate de mejorar un poco más en su vocabulario.
He looks so humble
As a Puerto Rican that supports Bad Bunny I have to admit this wasn’t his best album. A few good songs but not good. Not hating tho I love Bad Bunny just being honest 🇵🇷
I saw him on a Magazine cover at the Veterans Hospital
Bad Bunny totally called out Jimmy for not being a fan lmfao. Jimmy has the facts, but not the juice.
the Taylor part haha
This young kid is awesome. His sound is so different from everyone else. From an old school guy like me is hard to give it to young kid. Pero Benito la tiene es el mejor!!
He’s a total Pisces! He’s uncomfortable talking about himself
❤
RIDICULO
Tipo mamon!  Sin talento ..no talent at all
I'm not giving hate to bad bunny, but he should be lil appreciative to  taylor dancing on her music, just don't say you don't care, she's very supportive and and good luck to bad bunny, no  offense, love him
As person who relies on subtitles and knows Spanish, I'd like to start the petition for actual subtitles in Spanish instead of "Speaking Spanish"
Clearly this album is showing his insecurities, nice beat tho
People commenting as if he doesn’t know English when in reality he dates a mercenary white American girl who doesn’t speak a lick of Spanish. He’s smart! Love him
He gets so shy when he speaks English it’s cute 🥹
insupportable les gens qui gueulent
Que persona sin alguna gracia. Que pesado
Has come a long way since the Dr. Phil Show.
So umm..that’s who’s dating Kendall Jenner ?
Rompe récord porque ya tiene sus fans más no porque sea un buen álbum.
I've heard of bad bunny before. I thought it was a woman. Maybe I'm thinking bad baby?. I dunno.
jimmy mentiroso
Orgullo boricua. ❤🇵🇷🇵🇷
🔥💎❤️🇵🇷🔥👑❤️🇵🇷🔥💎❤️🇵🇷🔥👑❤️🇵🇷
Bad Bunny odia hablar en ingles hahahah
No me gusta la actitud de Bad Bunny en esta entrevista... Vi sus anteriores entrevistas de este show y se le veía más emocionado de estar allí... Siento que perdió su capacidad de asombro,,, No es malo porque no debe ser fácil lidiar con la fama, pero no sé... Esperaba más
y que enseñan en ese curso?
Peso Pluma over this has been
Junior Washington en la casa  I wish you the best. God bless you keep you healthy.❤
His English is so good now. He’s even saying “liiike” just like a native speaker 😂
Bad bunny: Hi  Crowd: 👏🏻👏🏼👏🏿👏🏾👏🏽 uuuuuuu  🙄
He does not speak English . No  body knows. He is attacking Shakira in one of his songs to get publicity. He is stupid . He is hiding his eyes, because he is high on met.
1:55 🥹🥹🥹 LOVE AL PACINO I LOVED HIM IN SCARFACE 💕💕💕
benito es muy latino
World war 3 that's wtf is going to happen just wait
The celebrities people worship will mean absolutely nothing when christ returns. They are only there to deceive every one and lead them to Satan and trust me they know.
I love you my Good 😂 Bad Bunny , te queremos Salinas , Puerto Rico 🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🙏 Muchas Bendiciones 😊
I LOVE Bad Bunny
Bad bunny is the best  he a good person and is very proud where he comes from. ❤
Mejor invierte en tu inglés mamon !!!
I love his humbleness ❤️
Que Dios te bendiga 🇵🇷🙏
how does he communicate with his gf…
Bunny's teeth....how disgusting
🇵🇷❤️🇵🇷❤️🇵🇷❤️🇵🇷❤️🇵🇷❤️🇵🇷
How is this guy famous? His music is trash. World's gone to shit
Jesus is king 👑
HE NEEDS TO LEARN HOW TO SPEAK ENGLISH LIKE MY COLOMBIANS SINGERS!!!! THEY GET EDUCATED AND PUT EFFORT ON EVERYTHING.....He Can't compete with my Colombians like MALUMA, JBALVIN.
He seems humble but over it a little like super overwhelmed by his being so dope haha
his music sucks just like him. It doesn't matter how much you try to shove it up our asses it will never stop being a huge crap
I LOVE his look. ❤️
I just realized that’s Al Pacino lol
How is this individual dating an English spoken person? lol
He is soolo coked out😂
Not speaking English as his first language is part of his artistic persona....
Stop screaming and clapping for anything, it’s annoying
I LOVE BAD BUNNY...pero....no te metas con esa familia. Esa mucha no quiere a ti. Ustedes no puede comunicar y la hermanas de ella usa la gente.
Humble artist.  God is the Greatest!
Bad Bunny you are awesome 💖💯
🔥🔥🥵🙌🏻🐰
Te amo papi que lindo!!! Poniéndola en la China!
His demeanor, his energy, so calming so sexy omg I have a new crush. Beautiful soul I can tell. 😍❤️🤗
No te olvides te TODOS los latinos que te apoyan
I nearly believe him when he said that al pacino is his uncle
Get ready to sell a testicle to see em live
Peso Pluma >
I love a man who is confident with his feminine side as well he is a real man❤
A very bad influence!!!
Pretty lame
I thought he doesn’t speak English at all. That’s cool!
Me da risa cómo las personas dicen que no sabe inglés, pero si fuera un artista Estadounidense hablando el español con mala pronunciación sería más pasable. Latinoamerica se discrimina a sí misma.
Please teach him to look at the interviewer face, and not to hide behind the hat. Stop looking down, that shows he is not a trustworthy person. He needs to be more secure. So glad his style is clean and nice now.
i love how his accent has improved so little over the years, thats just great hahahaha
Dificil de creer q este hombre tenga tanto exito. Incomprensible. No sabe cantar, solo dice malas palabras y su musica son pistas.Que horror
Bad Bunny Bad Music
Perfect!
😍
No one knows what’s going to happen in 2024 it getting crazy out there
https://youtu.be/RfQy-Es4Vag?si=stNi4Chv6slNOWoI
Pa' cuando colaboración con Taylor Swift?
Jimmy Fallon keeps going weird with his face  expression when he can't get what he wants from the artist.
Good. El hecho es que bad bunny 🐇 siempre se expresa con todo el lema en spanglish y eso lo hace superlatino
Good that he is speaking Spanish in a English language interview
Desde que descubrí a este artista no he parado de sorprenderme y estoy esforzándome mucho para algún día colaborar con ustedes
Making us Latinos so proud. Viva Bad Bunny. Me encanta que hable español tambien! Sigue siendo tu Benito
Of course NY is special for you, your fan number 🇵🇷 one lives in here, my Benito God Bless you always🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
can we get a late night host thats bilingual? or even better thats latino? also why does Jimmy asked the most stupidest questions? and what is he laughing at?  Love Benito
🔥
Amazing Benito 🫶
El peor artista de la historia, no sabe ni cantar. Deja en vergüenza a todo latinoamerica
🇩🇴🇵🇷
Bad bunny seems like a douche bag. Think he’s letting the success get to his head
The way jimmy asked questions 😂
This whole shit is cringe.  NEXT!
YESSSSS
Que hermoso es ❤
Bad Bunny,tu que estas recibiendo tantos reconocimientos te sugiero que hagas algo por la gente de tu barrio en Puerto Rico. Arreglale la cancha de tu barrio para que los niños y los jóvenes de tu barrio tengan un lugar donde ejercitarse y así evitar que se entretengan con otras cosas. Déjale ese legado a tu pueblo, a tu gente y a la historia  artística tuya. Ya que el gobierno  no se preocupa por arreglarla haslo tu que tanto dinero tienes. Vi un reportaje del YouTube Oscar Alejandro y tu pueblo te admira y se sienten orgullosos de ti.Demuestrale tu agradecimiento arreglando la cancha que esta cerca a ru casa para que se sientan más orgullosos de ti.
Love u bad bunny❤❤
Needs to learn English…
Jodio charro
I think alpachino just being sarcastic not really liking him??? He’s not your uncle
💪
bro im growing to dislike these late shows... so fake and unnatural
Not very eloquent, but he's OK
Do need to learn English 😂
Can't wait to see Bad Bunny in Philly in April 2024❤😊
How much was his soul??  He seems sadder
el mejor
Se ve todo muy incómodo es como si se sintiera obligado a estar ahí
❤
Callen a la de los aplausos
Representando a Puerto Rico en el mundo ❤🔥🇵🇷
We need a subtitled translation into Brazilian Portuguese
Crazy how no artists use their platform to talk about the war happening in Gaza.
These interview is So off like w t f …weird
Tanto dinero y no poder pagar un buen tutor que le enseñe hablar English 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
He's sooooo hot!!!!    AND a really cool guy!!!!!!     Best to Bad Bunny, and, really,  stay away from the Kardashians.     They are bad news, my friend.     Users.     Be happy, Benito.   Jeff from NYC.
El caballero más espectacular el que más presume del talento la clase pero al final es el más grosero en su música y ni hablar inglés sabe. Papi a estudiar mi Niño
I love how he can go from spanish to English & back into spanish. We all know what his 1st language is and he is very proud of his raíces. As he should:). Having Puerto Rican roots. Estoy orgullosa de el. Pa'lante Siempre.
Salvatore farino nasty orgy's
He’s a humble guy! Love it! Congratulations bad bunny ❤️
Digging the mixed languages, that’s real life!
Jimmy really sucks with questions. He makes a weird atmosphere
Habla español y inglés a la vez. Speak Spanish and English at the same time. Amazing!,,, 😂😂
Does he have like a hard on cause he kept moving he’s pants like it was too tight 🤨😒
Oh I seriously hate him he’s seriously rude
MONACO IT’S THE BEST ALBUM 💿 ❤ FOREVER

Great fucking album 😎🔥🔥
He's such a jerk, covering his face, arrogant horrible guy
He dismissed the part about taylor swift cuz he didnt want kendall to feel bad ❤
Y con ustedes: El ídolo de millones.
I love that he switches back and forth from English and Spanish ❤
Ni el diablo se atravio a tanto que tristeza la "música" de este tipo no aporta nada a la sociedad y mas estar en un show tan famoso e importante donde han pasado realmente músicos y personajes de peso, llevar a este payaso eso sí indigna.
Why chewing like that??!
But why I’m I emotional like I’m proud of a good friend 🥹
Jimmy, zero host
His new album is garbage lol
❤❤❤❤❤
Album klo malo
Solo los que en verdad se dam cuenta,  bad bunny quiere despertar,  esta cansado, cuando baja que creo que es una tableta  dice que no " hay que estar despierto " palabras claves  seguido le truena los dedos y lo vielven a programar.  .marioneta de la elite
is it just me or do I feel that him calling him 'bud' is a bit of a micro aggression
But is he or is he not dating Kendal Jenner?!
No se porque este hombre me gusta tanto como canta? Tiene un timbre de voz súper bonito. Y eso que a mi la Musica de este tipo de cantantes no me va nada. Pero el en especial me gusta un montón.
Bad Bunny está en su prime!!! Yuhuuuuuuuuuuu 🏆👑💎
el 1.
American white decent guys dont know him at all
Perate, este señor no fue quien maltrataba a sus empleados?
De mi barrio VEGA BAJA pal Mundo!!!!! 🇵🇷🦾 Benito eres grande!!! Nunca lo olvides!!!! Estamos tan orgullosos de ti! Te amamos!!! ❤️
I LOVE YOU BENITO💙🫂💽🔥

He is witty I like it. He's funny
Cantando estupideses y vulgaridades
Vi el video entero sonriendo 😁
🔥🐰🔥
Bad Bunny killing the charts! 🇵🇷
Bad Bunny always such a cool guy…
Cutie pie❤
Le falta humildad  a ese benito y deberia ayudar a la gente q necesita  q esta en la pobreza  y niños con cancer😢 es muy creido y muy arrogante
Pero no tiene mas repertorio el  benito q no deja en  paz a nuestros colombianos q son muy Talentosos y muy    humildes y  muy excelentes cantantes y  sobre todo muy divinas  personas❤❤❤❤🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲
He looks uncomfortable
Papasito 😋😍
Ladies and gentleman u looking at Aaron henrnandez

His teeth… 👀👀
Home 🗽
He is a genius
Wow, Al Pacino with bunny!!! Priceless 🤫😂😂🤣hope it's a movie they're are filming
Great vibe ltg ❤
Proud of my boy bunny!
Why is Jimmy still on? His interviews are cringe
🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷💪🏼
Brain cells ?   Much redundancy, narcissism & lack of essence😢
garbage, bullshit
Tan belloooooooo❤❤❤❤
Bad Bunny is the most perfect example that you dot need talent to be actor, like Michael Jordan in Space Jam✨️
❤❤❤❤❤😊
Ver a Bad bunny ser entrevistado por Jimmy Fallon solo me da a entender que ya este tipo es una puta leyenda viviente, sin duda el artista urbano mas exitoso y tracen dentar de todos los tiempos a nivel mundial.
Qué rico inglés masticado de Bad Bunny JAJAJAJJAJAJA
el mejor
b
He's so healthy, very nice.
What about Kendell?
🐰🐰🇵🇷🇵🇷🐎🐎
Is anyone still buying the nice guy act by Fallon?
Bro, cuántos cantantes latinos o de origen hispano les importa un carajo y se ponen a hablar en spanglish, tiene un punto por eso
Volvió el bead, ponny viejo, 🐰🐇🎶🎶🎶 yeh Yeh yeh
zzz
It looks like Bad Bunny did not want to be there to talk to Fallon.  From what people are saying, a lot of people don't like talking to Fallon.   hmmmm Bring Back Conan! :)
The Spanish voice just hits different
Dijo que solo para los fans que hace allí
He ain’t a so called Rich Portican (Puerto Rican) anymore, though he is white he can stay gringo, I also noticed he has nothing else to say about the drama and the corruption going on in PR, they shut him up!
❤❤❤
The worst music ever !! 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Da pena ajena escuchar a este tipo, tratando de conectar la única neurona que tiene para hilvanar una frase. Buen programa, invitado basura
Sh#t of album
🐰
Jimmy Fallon sometimes overacts. It´s so fake.
🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
I don't understand what people see in this guy, no habla ingles, no perfecciona su español, y sus canciones son 🤮🤮🤮🤮
Bad Bunny's English: "I ON'T CARE.., IT'S FINEEEE..."  😏😏😏
¡Wow!..., aveces veo cómo casi TODA las poblaciones de distintos lugares del planeta sólamente tienden a admirar y a consumir, más que, todo aquello que ellos puedan ver que está jalando "views" y "seguidores"..., NO importa si dicha celebridad NO SABE NADA de inglés ó, si dicha celebridad canta sólamente disparates!!!  🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ 🤣🤣🤣
I'm still wondering how he communicates with kendall😂😂😂
He's broken all records as a latino right now nobodys close 💪💪💪💪💪Even Kanye  west said this dudes is selling OUT stadiums thats what real artista due
I am Venezuelan and my dream is to collaborate with this great legend of an artist... Amen
Como que le valla el inglés
Loved it!  He is not like the others reggaetoneros that show off their jewelry, watches and brands..Bad Bunny seems so simple and humble in this interview
Bad bunny 🔥😎🤍
Se gastó los dos pesos de inglés que tenía Benito camela
El conejo bueno
❤❤❤❤
Jimmy needs a interpreter next time so when he start talking in Spanish 😂
Thanks Americans. Keep paying taxes and supporting genocide by the terrorist Zionists   https://youtu.be/YDv0mTxPMXA?si=M9Nd06u6mFec5x_o
Arriba la Música Latina puñeta

This guy is on automatinc rn.
Awesome 👏🏼
la cabra
He did drop hints 😂
goat benito
The lyrics 🤮
As a puertorican, Bad Bunny embraces what a Puertorican is - humble and real . That’s why he is very successful. Jimmy is such an excellent interviewer! 🫶🏽🇵🇷🌹
6:04 FACTS
0:48 “Algo así es, no?” 😭
TE AMO BAAAD <3
Correct me if I’m wrong. But it felt like he was talking shit about the Mexican culture along with some other Latin artists.
I hate these interviews because Bad Bunny has such a great personality when he is himself but when he speaks English it doesn’t show his personality.  Great artist and his music is so awesome.
so excited to see Benito as HOST omg !! i've been watching SNL since I was born :D
double trouble with Benito And Jimmy :D I love you both so much !!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Does anyone know where his hoodie blazer if from
SAN BENITO jsjsjs
El mejor del mundo, bad bunny
his music cheers me up🤩 I don’t speak Spanish but I feel his music🌎❤️⚡️and there’s no reason🥰😊😉
Bad bunny estornuda* El público: WOOOOOWWW!!!!!! 👏👏👏👏
Really don’t appreciate the way he’s been coping Katy Perry 😅
Us Puerto Ricans speak Spanglish
No todo es culpa de Bad Bunny, la verdad es que las masas populares actuales son las que no tienen interés de buscar música de calidad o en su defecto no tienen oído entrenado, pero si tienen la idea equivocada que entre más reproducciones en YouTube o Spotify mejor es el artista en cuestión.  Es lo mismo de siempre : "Te prometo que vo'a tratar de venirme afuera", "Ahora mi bicho es tuyo", etc. El tipo no es bailarín, no es un compositor de calidad, no es músico instrumentista y ni siquiera es cantante, solo es una especie de rapero (que ni llega a rapero) con una voz particular como de bobo que me recuerda a Homero Simpson y Peter la Anguila. Bad Bunny es una tendencia de la era del sin sentido, (traseros, excesos, memes) que en unos años será una resaca de la cual todos sentirán vergüenza de haber sido parte. Un collage paupérrimo de super estrellas del pop anglo en cuanto a excentricidades y producción musical llevadas al extremo más genérico y comercial diseñado para "pegar" con ritmos pegadizos y monótonos, letras tontas y repetitivas fáciles de memorizar... en fin, la decadencia en su máximo esplendor. Esta bien, es verdad que cada género cumple su función por más básico o decadente que este sea, pero lo peor es cuando dicen que "superó a tal u otro cantautor y músico histórico" como si reproducir una y otra vez en YouTube fuera sinónimo de talento musical. Si leiste esto y herí tu fanatismo no pierdas el tiempo en responderme, mejor inviertelo en reflexionar. Y si te preguntas que hago aquí es porque a pesar de no ser fanático del urbano latino y el reguetón, si escucho bastante del género y admito que hay otros que sí tienen muchísimo más para ofrecer.
Very nice guys!
“Lo más Cabron, real que escuchen mi música…” and this is right??!!!
Bad Bunny no sabe expresar sus pensamientos, tampoco sus sentimientos.  No entiendo como una persona puede estar número sin tener cerebro!!! Contestando tonterías, nada profundo.  Así de tonto está el mundo también!
Terrible interview, Bad Bunny do not how to express his idea, unbelievable how this guy is number one without brain!!! MIRACLES!!!
So proud of his accomplishments!👏 Keep it going Bad Bunny! We enjoy your music, and most definitely...YOU!🤗🥰🥰❤❤❤❤🎶🎵🎼🎙️
Bad Bunny the best Puertorican artist of all time.
This guy doesn't  sing. He barks. We need real singers out there.
Bad bunny “funniness” if you will, is lost in translation
When I’m feeling down, I listen to his music. it cheers me up. it’s magic⚡️☄️🪐🌪🌎❤️🤩  iPadから送信
❤
Benitoooo ❤️❤️❤️
Ahora le da vergüenza salir calvo en una pantalla 😂😂😂😂
EUROPE NEEDS YOU
from one puertorican to another, dale duro papa!
THAT FIRE ❤️‍🔥
You can not tell me this man is dating candle, ain’t no way. No hate to her or him but I just don’t see them vibe like at all.
Jimmy fallen is excited for every guest...why is he so fake
The best. 🎉🎉🎉
he was more funny with James Corden on Carpool Karaoke🥳🚀👍💥🥰♥️
I LOVE HIM ❤️❤️❤️
I guess he doesn't talk much..
❤
👁️
3:44 - 3:50 I know they did not just clap without understanding a single word he just said😂😂😂 jimmy was like yeah whatever he said😂😂😂
Didn’t he say he was taking a brake🙄 I was so happy that he was taking a brake!!!
Idk know how Kendall like him cuz she might think he cute but he don’t sound very attractive in english im sorry
OMG him English is very very well... I wish him English 😅
Y’all really don’t know how to read people body language whenever he goes to Spanish its cuz he can’t say it in english not cuz he wants to, get it together! & then he sounds so unenthusiastic everytime he gets asked about the album he just like “yeah I’m happy” like ur not looking like it, then when he got asked what does he like about performing he clearly was thinking about what bs to say and just went with what jimmy said literally added nothing, he not making eye contact and u can barely see his eyes with that hat🙄 and if we talking about looks Manuel turismo so much better
realizing how uncomfortable dude is with speaking english, kinda makes you wonder how he has a relationship with kendall
🐰 ❤
Wepaaaaa benito ❤🎉
I'm a Yankee fan too but damn bro take off your hat lol
BENITO, PUERTO RICO TE AMAAA 🇵🇷 ESTAMOS BIEN ORGULLOSOS DE TII!!
Chulisimo!❤
He's so fine! 😍😍😍
What is Bad Bunny?
His really a simple guy, sencillo el camarada.  He has pride for his Latin heritage, good for him.  Me da gusto que tenga ese orgullo por su gente, excelente ❤ su corazón ♥️ es su tierra
His accent 😍
NO ONE IS LISTENING TO THAT
Why's he wearing a hat and hiding his face?
He was too nervous 🥹 wish I could’ve hugged him 🐻
Porque estan tan incomodos?
It’s amazing how a lot of people are so stupid to listen this clown.  Unbelievable!
I don't know what to do about this phone?i"m takeing it back!.
Sorry but the guy cannot sing, he is rude coincided macho
I think he needs to take English lessons ... Can't even speak English
Bad bunny tú habla español ellos son los interesados que se adapten ellos 😾
🇵🇷🇵🇷 TE AMA!! ORGULLOSO DE TI💪🏼👍🏻💯🙏🏻.
El Conejo Malo! 🇵🇷 🇲🇽🫡

I love him 😩 that accent is too fucking cute ❤️❤️❤️
I love you 😍
Vilvio Bad Bunny CTM 🐰😈💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
how the hell does Kendall talk to him....
Thank 🌍 for 🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🤫🎶🎶🎶
Lo siento mucho. Se que es de gustos. Y cada quien el suyo. Pero su musica se me hace un mugrero que espero que mi hijo nunca escuche cuando crezca. Sorry Bad Bunny, prefiero mil veces escuchar a RobinDracoRosa, Puya, hasta Jlo. Pero. En horabuena!
He's clearly more comfortable speaking Spanish. You need to learn ESPAÑOL and catch up Jimmy!
💪🏾🇵🇷
BENITO...DIOS TE BENDIGA HERMANITO...❤️🍒
I love that he doesn’t care and keeps talking Spanish ✌🏼
Going out with Kendall isn’t helping for shit huh? He can’t even speak to English properly still… lol that’s wild.
🔥🔥🇵🇷🇵🇷
Bad bunny habla inglés y a la vez traduce lo que dice que crack
He said before that he hated the closed captioning saying -speaking spanish- Here it happens again. Come on NBC!
God bless you bad bunny you are a amazing star you deserve it you done it and be proud stay focused and safe 🙏
The Goat 💯🇵🇷🔥🙏 🐰
I can’t wait to see him!! It will be my first concert that I gonna attend, I will see you in Dallas!! 😅❤

Good music is dead
i don’t know exactly why my mom says that bad bunny is a a hole irl he seems like a chil latino 🤣🤣
Benito ❤
Benitooo!!
This talentless dude. You can tell the fame got to his head and after dating one of the Kardashians he became another famous just to be famous.  Why someone who doesn't sing is breaking records like that? Wtf listen to his mumbling
Jimmy had some stale questions here
🇵🇷🇺🇲
La Kendall le hizo buenos contactos
Me metí a ver los comentarios y veo que dicen que él estaba penoso pero ahora que vengo de ver sus otras entrevistas con Jimmy Fallon veo que más bien ahora ya se volvió pretencioso y no le sorprende ya la fama.
His new album sucks .... its mostly trap and it sucks
How on earth does he engage in conversation with kendall Jenner
Bad Bunny representando hasta hablando español que maquina es
7:59 Jimmy was so disappointed that he didnt even know SNL was on Saturday lol... Jimmys face was disgusted like "This phony..." lol 😆
Jimmy: So, do you like singing and performing? BadBunny: uuhhhhhmmmmm yes.  Jimmy: wow! That's great!
lets go janky stadium
He better release a vinyl for this album. Idk if this is just a mock vinyl.
He got to say "cabron" in the Tonight Show and got away with it. Legend.
puerto rican power papa 🇵🇷
Somebody has to throw a shoe at the lady that screams after everything bad bunny says
loved him since 👁️… if you know you know!!
When is the album out
Well now days any one can sing with no voice lol. esto comprueva que no tines que saver cantar ni tenr voz para ser famoso jaja
we love you Benito!!!!
Le da ladilla hablar ingles jajajajajajajajajjaja....
Its annoying not be able to listen for 10 seconds without the audience cheering
He was so happy !!!
I love that me and bad bunny share the important day of him at yankee stadium
The guy can’t even speak his native language properly and people throw money at him for mumbling in a record that sounds more like he has a speech impediment. I don’t get it.
So sad.
El ridículo 🤦,  el más arrogante que mal cae 😂😂😂😂
Bad Bunny está en su prime!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ BORICUAAAAAAAAAAA DIOS TE BENDIGA MUCHO HERMANO ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
OMG!!! He is so CUTE!!!!!!
Not sure what was more of a struggle in this interview, Jimmy Fallon struggling to get an interview and answers and Bad Bunny just not caring about the answers or struggling to give them
You guys should get Karol g again 🙏🏻
❤/\❤
Asco
THE GOAT!
Why isn’t he making eye contact lol
Isnt this Sam Asghari in a costume?
Cuando va a aprender inglés?
how does someone with so much success, have zero personality?
Bad bunny: Everyone in that audience: Wooooooooo🎉🎉👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Iluminatiiiii with another iluminatiiiii. End of story !!
Nos queda claro que con Kendall no hay platicas sino solo el delicioso jajaja
Just don’t bring La Candle to the show 😂
Let’s goooo more Hispanics on American talk shows
7:27 Jimmy hints to his late night routine👃🏻😤😂😂😂
Gringos por favor aprendan español Latino pa' que hablemos más 🙏😇
To me this whole interview is awkward 😬
Latinos making it more big and more big
Yeahhhhhh Puerto Rico ❤❤❤❤ te amamos Bad Bunny ❤❤❤❤
El rey Midas de la música, ese es Bad Bunny
qué chevere su acento..
I seriously don’t get him!! Flash in da pan! All burnt out and no place ta go!
que sobrevalorado este mediocre
How does he communicate with candle??
Conan way better than this Jimmy
Grande el bunny
El conejo malo
La reciente entrevista de Benito fue bastante difícil de ver. Todavía tiene dificultades para traducir el español al inglés de manera efectiva, a veces luchando por comprender las preguntas que le hacen. Es desconcertante que admire mucho a Al Pacino, pero no puede recordar cómo se conocieron por primera vez. Cuando tienes a alguien en tan alta estima, esperarías que esos detalles estuvieran grabados en la memoria. Además, tiende a murmurar en exceso, lo que dificulta entenderlo. Además, al presentar su nuevo álbum, parece vacilante en transmitir su título en español en inglés para el público estadounidense.
Benito's recent interview was quite challenging to watch. He still struggles with translating Spanish into English effectively, occasionally struggling to comprehend the questions posed to him. It's perplexing that he greatly admires Al Pacino, yet can't recall how they first met. When you hold someone in such high regard, you'd expect those details to be etched in memory. Furthermore, he tends to mumble excessively, making it difficult to understand him. Additionally, when introducing his new album, he appears hesitant to convey its Spanish title in English for the American audience.
i love his laugh
dang
really? classes about him, that's DUMB
El le hablara a kendal asi 😂😂
Was this the guy who mercilessly threw the girl's cell phone away?
Im big fan I love bad bunnny I'm getting a jacket this month

💯🆙💯🆙💯🆙🤝🆙🤝🆙🤝🆙🤝
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
No me gustó su disco.yo estoy acostumbrado a puro reguetón.peso pluma lo va  a ganar por no ASER disco bueno
The fact that he speak his English and Spanish it makes it all ❤
Would be cool to see jimmy interview bad bunny in Spanish hahaha. But I really do think bad bunny did good. I still remember when he met will smith in an RV? Correct me if I’m wrong, but this dude has come a long way with his English.
I thought bro would do the whole interview in Spanish with a translator. He can clearly speak English, he needs to make songs in the English language already especially since he's so popping in the USA, it would quadruple his fanbase
Yo no entiendo nada  😂😂
...
Now hearing him speak English I’m rlly curious how him and Kendall talk
El mejor, cortaaaa
Bad bunny said "Va estar bueno" and Jimmy says "No it's gonna be great"... hahahaha.. too cute.
No amo a BadBunny, pero me gusto q viniera vestido bn sencillo
un rey
live laugh love benito
i love him
Lot's of Bunnies all Over!

Pa'lante puñeta!!!!
I'm sure bad bunny all his life he thought Scarface was a real life Latino.... Until he met Al n it broke his heart when he found out Scarface was a fiction character 😂😂😂
❤🥰♥️😍♥️♥️♥️♥️
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
He said my name!!
AHHHH! Benito is perfection 😍😍
Smiling at my phone like a pendeja
Goat 🐐🇵🇷
Does anyone know why he struggles to speak english if he is puertorican?
🇵🇷 🇵🇷🇵🇷
He's hot but he likes white girls and white Latinas only
El español es el mejor idioma del mundo. Being bilingual is super cool.
Only know bad bunny from wwe
Great to see Bad Bunny a Puertorican on your show. Really proud of this kid. He is killing it 😎
Brother el orgullo que siento por él, siempre representando desde el corazon al Caribe entero ❤🐰
He's a very sexy man, he should do more modelling just for fun...my fun. ha! I love how he asks the audience if his translation is correct,as if he doesn't know himself lol he just panders to us all and it works so well!  Also good job Jimmy helping him out and moving the conversation along.
His English has gotten a lot better
I love benito... but my guy was high af for this interview
🌻🌻🤗
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎🤮🤮🤮
His name is 3 letters
HELLO HELLO BABYYYY❤❤❤❤🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒
Proud of my dude  🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷 Bad Bunny 🐰 Makin history
Bad no sabe hablar inglés
His interviews are always fun. He was also great in Bullet Train❤
He's so fine in his new york rican outfit 😍 ❤ 🇵🇷🇵🇷
❤❤❤
What records did it break?
Most peope do not understand the concept of his new album, which is: Bad Bunny vs Benito. The album shows a duality/ an internal fight between the person and the artist. The album begins with Benito venting about how he really feels about fame/controversy/what he values, he then tells us about other experiences (someone cheated on him, he wants to retire at 33, thanking his 🇵🇷 and important people in his life, talking about Carliz etc.) and then we hear Bad Bunny fronting his success, saying “I could be talking about something deeper, but this is what sells and it confuses me (people critique but consume his explicit lyrics the most), Bad Bunny says he is afraid of how high (on top of the world) he is and then the album ends with Benito’s Un preview saying that he is ready to fall in love again (with his current girl) and show us a bit of what’s coming next year: perreo pa las babies)
Do you see peso pluma with Al Pacino 😂 whacked out Indians
Donde están los BORICUAS Y ESPECIALMENTE LOS KE SOMOS DE VEGA BAJA PR  cerquita de donde TRABAJO  EN ECONO Y LA ESCUELA SUPERIOR high school 🙏🇵🇷🫶👍👍🇵🇷🇵🇷
So many years and he can’t still speak in English.  So stupid
Bring Cornel West😢😢
Viva nuestro Bad Bunny good for him. Representando nuestra gente ❤❤

Always nice vibes❤️
OK OK BENITO ! Por favor deja un poco la arrogancia , Jimmy estuvo tratando de preguntarte cosas para indagar y tú fuiste bien cortante , que te pasa?
1🐰🏆🌎🏟🐐🔥❤️😍🐰
Mi gente latina
Que orgullo mas cabron! PR
Bad bunny comes off so unlikeable. Hes was cool in bullet train tho
This guy is so boring. Learn to speak English foreigner. How does kardashian even fuck this dude smh
the most overrated "artist" in the world,his lirycs are bullshit the sound just  sound the same always,and his singing skills WOW,it seems like hes`s yawning,we are living the worst time for real artist,hope this shit pass fast
I love benito 💞😘
En español por favor,deberian ser conciderados con nosotros los latinos dueñoos del movimiento...LATIIINOOO...
FYI. Benito does not like to do interviews in English, he is not fluent (he is also an introvert), but the deeper reason is because when American or other foreign artists do promo in Latin America, they speak in English and the interviewer has to adapt to their language even tho’ the artist is the one visiting. Latinos and others are expected to make the effort and  speak in English, but not the other way around! Also, Bad Bunny doesn’t believe that to make it big and be successful worldwide, artists have to do an English crossover like most have, that’s why he keeps on speaking/singing in Spanish only and pushing Latin music in Spanish! 👏🏼💯🔥
Universities are a complete joke of woke insanity...not surprising he is a course.  They have them on drag queens for the love of God.  Our culture is over.
This is great but the lyrics are horrific and ghetto towards women. It’s gross
Humble??? he aint humble when he went to the DR he broke a fans phone.... He lowers his head because his shy when speaking English bc he is learning it.... I was a fan until I saw what he did to that fan...... Vete pa la MMMMMMMMM
FINE ASSSSS MOFOOOO🔥🔥❤❤😘😘👌👌
this guy has NO TALENT at all
Monaco es un intento de parecer relevante luego de que nadie lo peló en estados unidos😂
TH8S WAS DRAKE BACK IN 2014... NOW BAD BUNNY CAME TO TAKE OVER YOUR SHIIIDDD.... LATINOS STAND TF UPPPPPP....
Porqué mira para abajo constantemente? Esconde su cara
Cringe
🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷😊
Love BB ❤️
Is see his girl teaching him better English, he sounding better every time 😂
You guys noticed how this guy used to dress when he was first starting looking all flamboyant pushing an agenda look at him now they just really poison the youth and get money for it and they no that kids and there followers are so naive to know what they do sell outs  But this the cut throat business they run
i’ll never forget his first ever Tonight Show appearance in 2018 now he’s hosting SNL🔥🔥
Benito’s way!!! I’m proud of him!!
Qué cute verlo así de apenado y nervioso!! Lo amooo!!
Jimmy is so fake

Soy Bad Bunny cada vez que me toca hablar en Ingles por mi trabajo 😬
El conejo habla mucho más inglés de lo que el quiere demostrar en cámara.
The best 🔥🔥🎤🎤🇵🇷🇵🇷
BAD BUNNY YOUNG LEGEND! 🔥🔥🔥
Me encanta Jimmy Fallon y Bad Bunny, dejen que se exprese en español
Meu amorzão Benitooo
Overrated singer Bad Bunny.  Just my opinion.
Wow I didn’t know how little English Bad Bunny could speak.
THEY SHOULD HAVE AN INTERPRETER FOR JIMMY.
Soy la unica que no me gusta este chico ni su fisico ni su musica NADA!!!! 🤢🤢🤢
Since Chat GPT came out, I always read Al Pacino as A.I. Pacino.
I never thought I'd see the day NSL would have a host like Bad Bunny. We've come so far. From Ricky Martin having to record an album in English to Bad Bunny speaking Spanish on the top late night TV show. It feels good to be latin@!
I love this man. He has grown so much. He just gets better and better.
The veneers are out of control
He speaks better English than he does in this interview, he was just a bit closed off. You can tell he doesn't love being on Jimmy Fallon like he used to.
His English has improved so much! As someone who is learning Spanish, him speaking English is a great way to learn the language! So yes, he would feel more comfortable speaking Spanish, but for him to learn, he has to be in the language.
Joder con los gritos de los americanos no? Qué pesados. Se escuchan muy fuerte, interrumpen mucho y lo hacen cada 10 segundos. Al final la entrevista es de 3 minutos.
everyones praising him how good hes doing. hes 29 years old and he doesnt speak english...in this world? english is an easiest language in the world to learn, people learn it in 3 months and he still speaks so poorly? it's embarrassing.
& thats how he talks to Kendal 😂😂😂
https://youtu.be/PGOF_FSR__g?feature=shared  Great video for you 🥳
el rey Bad bunny, amo cuando habla en español, es su idioma dond se siente comodo,lo mismo me pasara a mi . Mi ídolo triunfando minuto a minuto.
Bad Bunny ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Not much of a bad bunny fan I like the old school trap bad bunny but a lot of the songs on this album gave me the chills 💯💯
La fucking cabraaaa !!!! 🔥
Grande Benito ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I’m just waiting for April so i can get to see him on Tour 🙌🏽
industry plant.
❤
Endebe darle la entrevista a Chente...
When he speaks English 😩
❤❤❤
Aquí!
People say he's humble because he speaks with a low voice in this interview...🤔 What it seems to me is that he proyects insecurity by speaking english, like if he was afraid of making a verbal-mistake. He should study and practice more since the interview is in an american show. I mean, he has the tools for it..!
🔥🔥🔥
talk spaninglish
Listen, being bilingual isn’t easy. It’s one thing to sit one on one with someone without an audience, and a whole different world to have people watching you. Becoming shy and overwhelmed is super easy. He’s doing great, he’s always being humble and doesn’t really like to brag or talk about himself that much.  He’s still in the translating to English era before speaking lol it’s totally normal.
Benito siempre hablando español❤
I never 👂 trap , when I hearing bad bunny , in 2016 I’m like wow 🔥. I’m he’s fan until 2016 until now .
El mejor
Que bueno Benito 💕 te lo mereces estar ahí 🤠 y en otros lugares . Díos  con Tigo siempre .
🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🥰🥰🥰🥰
benitoo
Te amo Bad Bunny ❤🐰
I can’t wait until the tour ❤️❤️❤️
English isnt his first language for those criticizing his Spanglish.. There are a lot of us who understood him in both languages. No te gusta.. No lo veas.. simple 🤷🏻‍♀️.. Benito te queremos! 🇵🇷❤️
Te amamos! Una leyenda! 🇵🇷❤️
Que orgullo puñeta
Lo amooo❤❤❤❤ me encanta como habla ingles❤❤❤

tan guapo benito, TE AMAMOS <3
Jimmy Fallon comes through like some lame self-entitled ** who does not understand espagnol when interviewing espagnol speaking guests.
Mi gente latino
Se nota MUCHISIMO que tuvo que aprenderse las respuestas. No se ve fluido como Shakira para hablar. Por eso baja la cabeza. 😮
I'm a Mexican American who doesn't speak a lick of Spanish and it's so annoying To be listening to an English station. And then have Spanish music, come on. Or be watching an English channel and then listening to a commercial. That's in spanish so sick of it. Even apple music flooded with music I can't understand it's america we speak English blood
habla igual de mal que yo inglés
No es la cabra es el CONEJOOOOO ❤
Where are the trolls these supporters are wack
His lips are out of this world!!! ❤
Love him🤎
Te amo benitoooo❤🇵🇷
10 años haciendo las mismas canciones xD
Hes so fucking sexy bro
Porque parece hablar voz baja y nervioso si en entrevistas en Puerto Rico fluye es cómico simpático, aquí parece retardado y no lo es!!!
Donde la entrevista con Chente ?
🐇CANT WAIT TO SEE YOU NEXT YEAR BB!
😴
So many years and he still shy,  the lowering of his head when he speaks to people is a humble sign and not a disrespectful sign. He knows where he came from and he still can't believe his fame. He knows today he could be on the top but "You never know what tomorrow could bring". Nunca sabes que puede pasar manana". Thank You Jimmy. We Love You 🇵🇷 Bad Bunny.
Rude Rabbit. What a crappy guest. Next, please.
🐰🐰🐰🐰🐰🐰🐰🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
he still doesnt speak English?
Lo amo 💘
His new album has been on repeat for a week now
Te amo Benito! Eres un orgullo para nuestro País! Cada vez que mi hijo te escucha me dice habla como yo! (Nadie en su escuela habla español) Eso me llena de mucha emoción! Pa’ Lante Benito! 🙌🏼💛
bad bunny sin entender un carajo 😂
Ily Mr bad BUNNY Nuestro conejo 🐰 MALO
Don’t know much about him. Good looking though! 👍😂
i love how he always come out with his spanish!!! ❤️ real proud of him 🫶🏻
Y los subtitulos en español?
I love that bad bunny is speaking both languages, shows how confident he is... He is so cool!!! We are very proud! As a Gringa I say - Orgullo Latino!  - (EDIT) @myriamgasperin163  Actually if you listen carefully, you can see that he does dominate both languages well, obvious he speaks Spanish better because that is his native language, but he choose to answer in Spanish first then answered in English the same thing, his accent is good and so were his responses, he might be a bit nervous...  So with all due respect I disagree.  Please don't hate on bad bunny, if you have nothing to say sometimes is best to say nothing at all, specially, if English is not your  native language, it is my native language and I say he spoke well.  We should appreciate his effort rather than criticize him... let's show love not hate thanks!!!
Bunny 🐰
he's so cute😂😂😂🤣🤣
I have to be honest, I don’t know why Fallon invites Bad Bunny to the show. I mean, if you’re gonna go to an interview in English? At least TRY!!! I can’t even watch the interviews. I get second hand embarrassment. If you want to be a global artist, you need to learn English. PERIOD!!!
I feel out of touch because I've never heard a single Bad bunny song. If I did, I didn't realize it. Pretty ridiculous handle really and even though he was in bullet train he didn't get to do much
He has the look and smells like balls of a rugby player 🤣

Love this joking BB . Proud of from where he comes. Proud and grateful of latinamerican people. Grateful of how people recieves his album. Enjoiying his interview.
I loved the interview, I enjoyed it so much. Bad Bunny is cool, it was interesting to hear him speak Spanglish. I'm listening to his album and it's incredible, I'll be at his concert, he really is a great artist ❤👏

Estoy tan Orgulloso de el Conejo 🐰 malo, you are doing better in English too, Les Aseguró que son puros hits en su nuevo álbum 💿.
La neta el disco fue bastante malito, y si son inteligentes podrán darse cuenta como la industria está moviendo todo rápido, lo están forzando todo, gira rápida para pasar a otro álbum lo más pronto posible, se ve un diferente Benito al que conocíamos, se le ve incómodo
