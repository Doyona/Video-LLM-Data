Name of the song?
Please 4 movie
The first one was amazing, got me on edge the whole time. I'm ready to be excited again!
They should do the next sequel.
So what are we, some sort of “Suicide Squad?”
Did the main character die?
This is kind of like Final Destination if im gonna be honest
I been watching the first one and just found out this one is out today. Right when I’m going with my bushes partners to an escape room . ❤
This was good
I miss this era 2021 was the year of cinema
guys the daughters birthday is May 26.this trailer was made in May 26.btw for those who don’t understand it’s Sonya Amanda’s daughter
0:44 I PLAYED THESE GAMES BEFORE AHH MOMENT 🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣
virgin
the fact that they had played this brings too much fear
Waiting for part 3❤
It’s unfortunate that Escape Room didn’t do well when it’s so much better than that nasty gory Saw films.
first movie was great but the cliffhanger at the end made me so mad
Just didn't get the whole meaning
More like Torment of champions!
Omg I was watching this at my mom's friend house for hari ray a then we saw this and my mom say we go soon and then we go me and my brother was like mom 41min until the show finish and then we go becuz we need to go to another house for hari raya😭😭
Song “Survival” dy Scala & Kolacny Brothers
I don’t get why this move has so many bad ratings…. I liked it even more than the first one.
1:31 what room 🤔
I saw this trailer in YouTube kids somehow 😂
I have played these games before!!!
Worst movie time and data waste
With chapter three they should make a disco room game room fire station room and the traps are for the disco rooms the discs are sharp to cut you and Zoey escapes and a man called max did not so yeah for the game room there are aliens from that one alien game if u run out of time and not escape through the prize box I will explain the others later btw

Why don't filmmakers invent a new reward for the "shittiest movie of the year" 😊
2024 anyone
Worst movie ever made
Worst movie I've ever seen
Trash movie
This film was re titled “Escape Loom 2” for the Asia release.
I like that movie. When is the third one?
omg lydia
I am stressed out the whole movie fr
Loved it, but some of clues were silly.
فلم زربه نعلعله اهلج تبارك
what the swag
Sony 🙂☺️ WHEN ARE U GOING TO MAKE THE 3 escape room movie?????????????????????😔😔😔😔
i WATCHED TIS IN NETFLIX I ALMOST CRIED
Happy 3rd Birthday trailer!!
trailer release date 05/26
I finished watching this movie , and I'll be honest I loved both the movies and I was so excited for a part 3 , did some research and found it might not happen , and the ratings to both the movies were also okayish , i mean I need to understand why people didn't like it , I enjoyed every bit
Do’s anyone know the music used for the trailer
So where can I watch this second sequel this 2024? 😂
Today i watched it again😊 2 may 2024
can anyone send me the link of the full movie ?I can't find it
Something really weird is happening, I have watched both of the movies like a while ago, and I know rewatched them. But I can remember myself a scene wherein the on who died from the upside room came back and said "What you didn't see, didn't happen." and she designed this escape room. I can also remember Ben being stuck in some kind of room where she tried to get him out, they broke the waterpipe, and escaped the building. I also remember like a psychogolist helping her to get rid of her fear to fly. And then at the end of that movie, they got on Minos airlines. Anybody knows where I saw this?
Good
Lol what about the plane they were suppose to get on?!
The audacity of “welcome back”
They suppose be a plane
They should have kept in the welcome to Minos escape rooms tho.😢
is this released?
is that AMANDA!!!???
Am i trippin, or wasnt there a different ending to this one? and beginning? Sonya is the girl, daughter of the "boss" man, and she was "trapped" in a glass room, and could only escape with help from someone outside? Some time in the end, Zoey and Ben finds the girl, and helps her get out? The father killed the mother in the sauna? Girl is forced to create these rooms, and she put clues in them, so Zoey could find them? tell me im not trippin?
so like squid game.....but less money?
This Netflix
Zoey and Ben returned from the previous horror film since 2019
It woz dumbz I tell thee.
Naaaah twoz 🗑 🚮.  Dithernt bovva ⌚️ ing it. Scoo 🐝 do is betterer. Dis iz a steamied heapz ov 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 's.
So I watched this movie a couple months ago on prime on my friends tv. I don't have prime so I just rewatched it on a website and the one I just watched had sense added and deleted in it. The ending was completely different? I mean both were good just confused on if they made two of the same movies or added in deleted sense? and both sense are in this trailer??
Wasn’t expecting much with this movie, and I was still left bitterly disappointed, what a steaming pile of dog shit film, horrible acting horrible everything
Where can I watch it at
This movie was so fucking bad 😂
in which part does she get to her daughter who is locked in a cage??i remember as a father he made his daughter and she was showing zoe how to get to her?? in the end they killed her father, so that zoe would think that everything is over, actually her daughter is sick and she continues to make games.???can someone help me i'm lost...
korang kene tgk movie ni best gile
Excellent movie and effects ... but the set up was shockingly bad. Too coincidental that they all just happen to end up on the same train, on the same carriage, at the same train station and at the same time. I can think of a few story lines they could have used to set up the intro. But that aside, the special effects throughout the rest of the movie were amazing. Really well done. A fascinating concept.
Is this like Saw for Zoomers?
Good Excitement Gaming movie 👍👍
Good movie
I like Zoey. She acts naturally and the role really fits her. Her innocent looks is actually a smart braniac.
I absolutely love this movie, the best I’ve seen in a very long time, it’s such a shame that the first movie isn’t on Netflix
Dog shit movie to be honest. Smart and nice plot but the acting and everything it’s just not there.
Worst movie ive ever seen, like a copy cat of Jumanji, actors dont act, script dont make sense. cant finish watching it
The guy gave you back sometime that they stole from you. Did it look suspicious? How did he know it was yours? She should notice that detail.  Btw What the heck happened to Amanda ?
This is way better then the movie saw
This movie did not live up to my expectations.
So it's July 2023 and when will we get this awesome movie ??😅
This is the worst movie of All time
❤❤
we want part 3
Love in the trailer when it gets close to the end Zoey says; we’re in the game hey then she falls into the trap door of the taxi cab.
the saddest part for me was when the 2 women died under the rain. Rachel was my favorite. I was rooting for her but too bad only one person could get in the taxi. All three had a their part in solving that puzzle but only one made it out.
I hope they make a part 3!
The concept is good - but IMO very poorly executed. There is way too much screaming - and the movie seems to have been directed by an young adult. With the underlying plot - it should have been an edge-of-the-seat experience. What a missed opportunity!!
I watched both movies now and I immediately want the next one and the one after that 😃
This movie is annoying with the fact that they never got a “reward” for escaping.. like they should have millions with that traumatic experience and then the masters have the audicity to bring them back to escape again 🤐
Where to watch this movie
Producers, Hurry & Brew The Escape room 3 please.
These movies are literally some of the best movies ever made they're directed so well
Taylor Russell is amazing.  She's turned Escape Room into a profitable franchise.  One I'll continue to watch as long as she's apart of.  I would like to see her expand that into more mainstream big budget films as she's really talented.
Twitter sent me here 😊
Nhi bhyii hm middle class valo ka bukhar crosin m hi chla jata h Or khansi jukam adrk vali chai se😂😂😂
I hope a third movie is made. But the question is will they follow from the storyline of the theatrical release or the alternate version? The theatrical and alternation versions are basically 2 different movies. I think I prefer the alternate version better, but there were cool aspects in the theatrical version I liked too. Whichever direction they go with I hope it is the right one and it works out in the end for the third film. Maybe the third film could be called "Escape Room: The Final Puzzle".
The game is like Saw btw it was a good
Alice in Borderland vibes
What’s the song in the trailer?
Isabelle isn't in?
Never thought Nateman will be the best boy in this film. I am so proud of him.
This movie was poorly advertised, I’ve been waiting years for it and just realized it came out about 2 years later
this movie is gooddd! i need the next season
this is crap
I didn’t realise till later that the girl who her father locked her is in fact Isabelle Fuhrman! The child actress who played the movie Orphan in 2009! I watched Escape Room Tournament of Champions then I watched Orphan First Kill (2022) and then I was shocked that the girl in Escape Room was Isabelle Fuhrman! I didn’t notice it! 😆  Both are great movies btw, two of the best movies I’ve watched this year!
I loved that there is lessons gore and more puzzle solving.
Great movie 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽definitely recommend it to those who have not seen it yet. Thank me later ;)
We gotta try something right?no no no no no!
Zoey&mario:i not trust you bowser not now not ever
0:07 what-
so much panting in this movie it sounds like a porno
This is messed up rented this from red box and it's sadly nothing more than a repeat of the first one waisted time and money smh
Was I the only one waiting for the rooms to connect to the players in which the clues came from their real life trauma events that happened and without the player they would have to figure it out themselves bc in this one I don’t recall them doing that.
No one selfish and everyone is helping each other. We call it team management and we want spirit like this
Any escape room this year ?
It's like squid game
So i watched this was ok...but the black girl was kind of ruin it...throughout the whole movie she was acting like im the main actor, i know all the clues and answers, im the one who survives...would of been good if it was some other that won...

What is the song call
Izumi Akazawa Eyeless Jack Austin Williams Dread Ducky Bea Santello Mr Wolf Porsha Crystal Diane Foxington America Chavez
just watched it and there were a few flaws in this part 1) first of all the lead actress that played the zoey character can't give expressions for anything. In the most intense of the scenes too her energy and expressions were both so dull that it killed the whole vibe for me. 2) Most of the plot in this part seemed very predictable and cliche like I was able to guess who'd die when. 3) 90% of the movie was just them guessing number sequences like come on add something else too...
horseshit
i hate this video
This really reminds me of the Squid Game.   Need to go watch this.
I really like both parts 👍🏻
One of the best movie I have watched. so many Twists and very shocking scenes. Waiting for 3rd part
Izumi Akazawa Eyeless Jack Dread Ducky Austin Williams Bea Santello Mr Wolf Diane Foxington
What a disappointment it was. totally wasted the built up from the first movie. traps are far too complicated and less interesting. They seem to miraculously  get ideas to solve puzzles in a hurry. They have just rushed this movie without planning it very well.

So let’s cut to the part where Amanda said “if you didn’t see it, it didn’t happen” what if that meant for both movies, like Danny fell in, we saw him in the scene that he actually died, amanda, we saw her fall but we didn’t see her die, mike, we knew he died because Jason killed him, then Zoe past out but we didn’t see her die, then we saw Jason actually die in the illusion room, also whenever it was the beginning of the first movie, we saw Ben being trapped between the two walls, it was squishing him but we didn’t see him die, Ben, amanda, and Zoe were all the ones from the first movie that we didn’t see die, so it all makes sense to what Amanda has been saying, so now if we go to the second movie, we see Theo actually die from the electricity, so it did happen, then we see Nathan sinking into the sand, but we didn’t see him die, so he could still be alive, then after that we saw Ben sink into the sand, and we didn’t see him die, and he happened to be alive, that also gives more evidence that Nathan could still be alive, after that we see Rachel and Brianna in the acid rain, now this one was tough for me because I think they died but also Zoe fell into the taxi seat so I have no clue if she saw it or not, my theory is that Rachel and Brianna are dead, so if you read this all here is the recap of what I just said. Danny= dead Amanda= alive Mike= dead Zoe= alive Jason= dead Ben= alive Theo= dead Nathan= possibly alive Brianna= dead Rachel= dead Thanks for reading :)
This is such a horrible trailer. Spoiler-ish, almost every death was spoiled. Scenes from both versions of the movie are present in one lmao
What music was the trailer using
This is by far the most intense movie I ever seen. I watched it 30 min ago in my heart beating crazy!
I'm scared for real for real hahah
WAY TO RUIN THE MOVIE, MORONS!  Thanks for showing all the scary parts.
This movie sucked so much- acting and storyline- not that the first one was any good but this one was awful.  I think the turning point for me where I was like "wow I can't take this any more" was when she realized minos's daughter was crafting the games and immediately screams "you're a murderer." The leads acting is dog water and it sucks that movies like these get funded at all.
Just watched it and was amazing probably best movie of the century
How did I miss this????

What Song Is
This is the first thriller/suspense movie that i watch where the characters helped each other instead of betraying others just to survive. i love it.
This was a really good fcking movieee. i always thought that the first one is amazing but this one turns out to be better! it’s just sad that the second movie did not do well as the first one in box office, but i just hope that they would push the 3rd installment. cause if not the ending of the 2nd part would not make sense.
ending is suspicious
This trailer gave away WAY too much of the movie
Am I the only one who've watched this like 2 months ago then go rewatched it and find the ending changed? The guy friend's supposed to be dead and the girl found out the true mastermind behind all of this and there's no sequel at the end?
plennty of scenes weren;t used in the making
Those plot twist shocking tlga tejj
One of my favourite movies of all time but i just really didnt enjoy the extended cut.... like they removed so many intresting parts including Amandas return
Mist cringe actor and movie
This movie is awesome, more thrilling than the first one. It looks like we're gonna get part 3 right? Lol "escape room: we love you Zoey and the game will haunt you forever" 😭
I love this movie. Do not trust rotten tomatoes! I thought it's gonna be a certain way and was disappointed at first but I wasnt't! I also love how all the actors were great which is not always the case in this type of movies.
Literally squid game
The one thing I really love about this movie is that no one is selfish. Everyone's checking if the others are okay and everyone helped.
To be honest, it's a meh for me. It finished too quick.
Kinda shit tbh. The decisions they make throughout this series of movies really insult the average person's intelligence.
Escape room 2017, 2019, 2021 done.... what's next?
Just an FYI, if you plan to watch this movie, there is two totally different plot or ending to this movie (last 20 mins).
Too much like Saw..
High budget..😶
This movie is the best I like game movie horror 😇 I want they make part 3 of this 😀💞 this movie is better than squid game I hope they make part 3 of this escape room this is the best 💖💗🎥
this movie is amazing and psycho in same time, 9/10 is my rate
Movie was absolutely terrible with horrible acting.
Why man why?why criminals escaped??
Who the heck adds so many spoilers in the trailer? such a waste.
I LOVE THIS MOVIE, THIS NEED A PART 3
The movie was so intense that half of the movie felt only like 5 mins. I was on edge the whole time. Crazy
CAN'T WAIT FOR THE 3RD MOVIE
👍👍👍
Type of movie I wouldn't care if it gets canceled, its whatever.
I can't believe they are making a second one can't wait to see which one is shitter
great movie
was thinking of this first film i remembered the autistic winner saying blue room, kept thinkin of it then  this film fell into my lap
It s fun,but they shall make something even more and with characters with super skills.
I just dnt get the concept of this movie. How the hell from the subway it ended in the Mansion? Even the first one i dnt get it. It is good, but the concept to have a  twist with those scebe in different places i dnt actually get it
Loved it 😍
Way better than squid games
Beyond awful, dont waste your time.
This was so good!
Again, why do we need the third one of this?😂😂
This Was One Of The Shittiest Laziest Sequel
Spoiler alert           I hate the Spanish guy died on the first game he was a good character and smart too. It's sad he died on his gfs bday. 😭😭
i think its ben ...he stays with zoey and always made it out alive
Is there two versions of this movie?  I watched the one... In which there's Amanda
Can anyone tell me is this movie is connected with first part or not
One of the worst movies i have EVER seen. Seriously the actors were horrible! Especially the main characters. I couldn’t stay interested at all. Complete waste of time watching it.
looks so mid
Spoiler alert: this movie is trash 🚮
This movie is awesome really waiting for part 3
I just finished the movie on Prime Video, and it was breathlessly astonishing!  They even upped the game in the sequel so more thrills! Gosh, I really hope there will be a third one!
B grade movie to the max
What is the song at 1:14?
So it's SAW in the subway tunnels.
Just finished watching this, was super good throughout the entire thing !
Dude they’re just milking it with there’s going to be another sequel to this movie at this point. Don’t get me wrong I like the movies it’s just that they’re over doing it with the sequel plot twist bit.
Average Twitter user trying to escape the echo chambers of Twitter
AMAZING!!!! AMAZE BALLS!!! I can't wait to see how they top this one. More please.
What a cheap trick ending.  FFS
criminally underrated
This movie was crazy! Guess there will be #3.
if anyone is thinking of watching this, don't. the acting is bad and the writing is terrible. the first one was a lot better.
This version was desperately over reaching in EVERY WAY. It’s noisy, full of hysteria and the camera work headache making.  The clues and riddles are completely unrealistic. Not only would no one figure any of them out on any IQ range they were absurdly devised. After about 30 minutes I turned this shit show off. Done and done.
MY parents will watch this movie
escape room of tournaments of champions and escape room
pls I havent watch it in XXI
The main kid is a bigot and a hypocrite.
The core ofnthe movie just unreasonable panic, random screaming, forced-logic scene, and unable to make the viewers thinking... bad movie (for me)
The trailer is such a spoiler! I don't want to watch it anymore >:(
Who is singing at minute 1:13  ?
i would have actually like to seen the escape room with the influencer character brianna
This is streaming on STARZ this Thursday night......
just watched this, oh my god. I'm so mad its so bad im raging.
ESTHER YOU'RE HERE AGAIN!!!!
From the producer of the fast and the Furious and the director of insidious the last key?! Let's play a game!!
Скажите пожалуйста что за фильм и как называется на русском?!
What is the music in the the trailer called?
They put the last scene of the first movie in this trailer (the flight scene simulation). I guess it’s a clue to the flight at the end of the second movie and probably the new game of the third movie.👌🏻
very unexpected ending
So beautiful movie i see it in my laptop 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I loved the first one. So def gonna watch this one
lol this movie was ridiculous.
Escape Room: Tournament of Champions may be fun, it's also incredibly stupid. the electricity in the train, the sand that swallows you up. please. part 1 is much better. part two is more like SAW
This was a awsome 👌 movie both of them were awsome 😀
Yo,, this movie is very recommended!!super exciting and intense!!the challenges is so brilliant that i could never think of😆 The actors just kept shouting and their voice get raspy😂 pretty sure brianna got sore throat🤣
Trash movie
Just watched it... First one i was with it and understood everything because it wasn't going at 100 MPH. This one was far to rushed and hurried and lost track a bit, To much going on to quick, The movie needed an extra 15 minutes to slow things down. All things considered loved them both.
I loved the first movie, and I’ve waited so long for this. I’m so exited to watch it
Worth watching or just MEH?
I tried make it similar in gmod
I think this needs more advertisement or something that can make the movie to be known! this movie is so GOOD 10/10  if not because of Tiktok I will not know that escape room has a new movie. I'm the type of person who is picky in movies but this one is 100% good! I hope people will find this movie and next time I hope that they will make more advertisement about this so that a lot of people will see and watch this more. because I'm into social media but I didn't see any ad about this movie until I use TikTok and some clip show. GOOD JOB SONY! you made my day!
"I'm not playing your game, not now not ever"... But I want more... I hope for part 3 the film was perfectly and incredibly amazing!!!
for the people who are watching this trailer...  If you are confused whether to see this movie or not...  Just try it once I promise, you will not gonna regret it.
Damn, how did I miss this?
I drempt that the third movie poster was released and was called Escape Room: The Sole Survivor. Seems legit
I haven’t had this much fun with a movie since spider man 2! I can’t wait for part 3!
It was so sad movie for me 😭🥺
why is her voice so hoarsey?
The cinema is the only room I will be escaping
I already know the black girl wont die so whats the thrill?
NICE
The trailer could be better I mean they spoiled the whole show for us alr :/
This movie should be R18
This trailer sum up all the movie in 2:34 min. Now I don't want to see it.
Next page 2023 escape room possible Entrance killer Ride or trade Collide borrow Islands in the way Cube sacrifice String of death Amusement clown park  Hollow candy The earthquake cave Last stage Games of enternaty

Can't get enough of that crazy shit. Ready for Escape Room 3 in the airplane 🤪😱😈
Crappy movie, not worth your time. Trust me
Ive never laughed so hard watching a movie before this movie is hilarious
Some of the acting is cringy and bad but it entertained me I was laughing like crazy
Following success of Squid Game i see
Is this in webtoon ?
i think this is more better than squid game
0:40 the voice from squid game🤣🤣🤣🤣
Isabelle fuhrman....claire ..has grown up now from the orphan..if anyone noticed..🙂🙂..and she still is in plans killing people...😅😅
Good
i didnt see the fire scene why
2:12 that's really f*cked up bro
*😒AIN'T NOBODY GOT TIME FOR DAT...JESUS JUST TAKE ME HOME WITH YOU NOW🙌🏽....I DID NOT SIGN UP FOR NO INTENSE LIFE OR DEATH GYM MEMBERSHIP 🤨*
gotta watch this, but ARE YOU INSANE?😃you guys just need to work on the TRAILERS not SPOILERS 😃and you're giving us the whole PLOTS 😃 and you're telling me that Ben never made it?
i just finished watching this, and i hated it... tooo much loud screams too much noises, puzzles didnt make any sens with the amount of screaming its just toooooo bad
where i watch this movie?
i dont understand, why is everyone talking about the man saying tournament of champions?
Honestly it just seems like they took the premise from Cube with the puzzle nature of Saw
Aftet squid game i’ll watch this!
What are we? Some kinda Tournament of Champions?
They better make a third one. I liked this movie. They do a great job of creating heightened suspense during the rooms. They’re so imaginative. It’s the reason why the Saw franchise was so popular (back in the day). It had it’s flaws, but the actual escape room sequences are so well done… I’m annoyed at how mediocre it was rated.
Where i ca watch this full movie for freee? help plsss
This is one of the most spoilery trailers I've ever seen...  Sony has a real issue.  Venom, Venom 2, Amazing Spider-Man 2, Escape Room 2.  It's becoming a problem.
Plottwist: the game is about on who shouts the most....the guy (lead actor)won the game....
It's extremely depressive. No.
these dead games genre is really having a popular time these days...
Watching the trailer after I've watched the movie. 😁
Imagine Friends in this movie.  Joey: Hey, that Apple looks sweet.  Ross: Joey, no!  Joey: These people don't have basic human decency to keep sweet apples in here.
This film should be called, escape room the tournament of Harvard and MIT graduates
Movies billionaires want to see a death trap game, real life billionaires, bill gates obsessed with transforming poop into water and perfume
Oshe osh osh looks like it will be sooo good ! The last ones were sick !
this movie fucking sucks, ben dies
MrBeast 2050 be like...
Im glad they made a sequel.  The last one - I wanted a little more background on the sick folks.  I dont know - just wanted it more fleshed out.  I hope this one gives more insight other than "just a bunch of rich prics who are bored and want to kill people in puzzles)
This trailer is so bad , because you can see who dies first second and third 🤦
The trailer look promising, but when I watch the movies is totally a mess. I'm so disappointed.. Too much nonsense screaming and mumbling, also they all champion, but act like beginners.. I was hoping something more than the first one.
When does this come out on DVD
The trailer was kinda overdone.
Personally, the first one was a fave. The acting was significantly better than this one and the ending to this felt rushed.
another squid game
I can barely find my keys in the morning i know I’d die before the game even starts …
The first one was really good.  This one looks stupid
worth watching it!
I really want a part 3 after that ending 😩
This movie was straight trash, and I was looking forward to it. 😞
at the end, the girl got to know that she is stupid.
this part was a lot of unnecessary drama and decisions,  and lot less brutal
just like 'the cube' :(
Sad the two girl the last die casue the water is acid i already whatc this but i forgot the player name
OMG INDYA MOORE 😻
I'm glad ben was saved
Cinema Summary 😩😩😩
Remember Alice from Resident evil. She's the only one who can escape that room without too much talking.
Just when I thought Isabelle Furhman was a good character for once lol
Have you ever watch this movie ??
hlw ভাই এটা হিন্দি রিলিজ কখন হবে কেউ জানলে একটু বল
I finished watching Pose and it's nice to see Indya Moore in movies. And Holland Roden, I remember her Teen Wolf days.
The squid game on netflix is better😉
SPOILER    i dont understand why those two chicks didnt just roll under the car when the acid rained down
The first one was worth to watch. This one? Nah. . .
If you read this without having watched the trailer.  DO NOT WATCH THE TRAILER the movie is great but this shows like 90% of the movie
John Kramer...jigsaw....should watch this..😂😂😂
Guys definitely worth watching it! Can't wait for the possible final movie which will be the cherry on top!
i’ve watched the movie, i think they did cut some of the scenes out cause in the movie there’s no scene where ben is trapped in the water thingy.. hmm, wished they would’ve kept that in! 7/10 maybe cause i feel like they could’ve done so much more with rachel cause she cannot feel any physical pain, instead of just dying in the acid rain..
Next Movie 2022: Escape Room (Mobile Legend of Champions)
I loved it!!
Tournament of Champions? I guess that makes this the Quater Quell…
I cant believe I wasted my time watching this BS
crap
is there deleted scenes? i didnt see that teddy bear in the movie....
I was really excited for this because I liked the first one. But this one kinda disappoint me. I enjoy how they play the game there's a thrill what I don't like is some of their acting.
Genuinely the worst film I've ever seen in my life. Like, usually that would be a sarcastic statement but it's just painfully awful.
Alice in borderland
Get rid of the blatts. We don't want them in movies. They're only there for the SAG discounts.
So is this the new modern day SAW?
The real villain is not dead.
This movie so great even my mother in law scream. Hahaha
Did they decide to completely change the movie because ar first the trailers were they are in a plane and now theres no mention of a plane no scenes in a plane or anything
I watched half of this rubbish film and could stand no more.
When the rich and powerful get bored, we get f%&cked ! 😭
why that ben water scene and amanda i not see in the movie??????
Great movie especially for a sequel could arguably be the better of the 2 films
i dont want ben to die, he's too precious 🥺
Did this trailer pretty much show the whole entire movie?
are they really nuts touching electric bar with bare hand?
🇿🇦 it was made in South Africa CAPETOWN
Terrible acting to the poin of cringing while watching, some obvious scenes, and when it comes to the puzzles they are cool, the problem is that with some of them they could just skip many steps of the puzzle like that one in the bank i mean they would be able to jump across at least half of those tiles toward the bank vault... all in all  6.5/10
This movie is.......conveniently stoopid 👎😤
Spoilers alert....  Actually I already expected that the girl s the real antagonist cause she's smart and scaperoom s not always happy ending, so I'm shock I'm right right😂 well that might means there will be another scape room movie🐹
I prefer ths kind of thriller movie than movies with scary faces, I cant sleep whenever I see scary faces hehe
What f  there will be another sequel showing the game of the other casts here.(priest group,influencers and not feeling physical pain group) like n final destination hehehehe
Spoiler alert!  I'm so stressed while  watching  this almost wanted to stop watching then I'll found out that the master mind s still alive in the end 😑 thought its a happy ending, then what happened to priest btw? Hes also just swallowed by the sand like Zoe's friend and Zoe's friend alive n the end
The film is🔥🔥🔥
So I don't understand. At the end when Claire was in the room and she got out, it turns out she was behind everything. Wouldn't she have known what the clue to get out her room was?
This movie is a bit trash. I'm still like the first one. That's the best
I LOVE ESCAPE ROOM 😍 every movie 🥰
Super Movie
its like alice in borderland
these days i'm always on the lookout for stupid trend of anti male feminism and sure enough this one is no different...... LOL... Hollywood, you're lame.
The movie was kinda dumb, its like the puzzles were impossible but the girl with the libs somehow manages to know everything without clues lol. I think part one was better.
In the movie Rachelle is the one who says "So what is this tournaments of Champions?" and to be honest theres a lot of scene that has never been show in the second movie in this trailer.
How is this franchise still around it's so unrealistic and the only bright spot is no black men are being bothered other than the black chicks father's
I see there are many scenes here that were actually deleted in the movie!
there's some missing scene from the trailer that isn't in the actual movieeee. yyyy???
This movie was so shit. The acting was terrible.
2:07 sad that they didn't add this
idc what y'all say these movies were good
Zoey just let the goat out the next movie would be intense
i think the first is better . good movie but  missed the quality of the first part
Legit thriller movie made a 100 PERCENT WATCH
Its the most sense making type of jigsaw ......the movie is awesome .....
THE TRAILER SHOWS 79% OF THE FILM............
I think there's another part
Cheap version of the Cube...
Can't wait for the new movie where the winners of the second round compete again
1:55 Ben trapped in a glass room? 1:58 water escape room? 2:06 fire escape room?  2:07 teddy bear..  I’m sure I’m not the only one who didn’t see these scenes in the movie..? Right?
If I’m being honest which I think (well I am) most of us are only here to see if Danny survives the film or at least halfway.
Why is it that people re-produce movies that were epic, and make it into such awful movies. Not only do I strongly smell the feminist touch to this, not that anything is wrong with women but don't force it, its been like that with most movies coming out lately. They make the women so intelligent, and strong willed that the movies isn't even great. Nobody likes that in the end, it wont be a great movie like the once before it.  There was a time when you could sit down, and appreciate both the women and men in a movie and not think about the characters but the whole movie, and just enjoy it. Now you cant its literally been smerred in propaganda for women. The thought put into the movie also doesn't make it any better, it seemed rather dull compared to not the first movie, but older movies with escape room scenarios.  Now I respect women, I have never hurt or wronged them. Never act superficial or ignorant towards them, I know most men do, but don't punish me for that, I don't want garbage movies where you put too much effort into making the female character look amazing, and godly in every god damn movie I watch. I also don't want an escape room where its a story, what we want is pure carnage some maniac picking random people in every movie and butchering them.  This garbage like its first movie was god awful. Change can be hard for some to take, and people might say Its me having a hard time with all the woke losers compressing their agenda into movies to make a better picture for women. I can say wholeheartedly that its not, it just don't fit the movie.   If you wanna make movies where females are supreme you make movies such as: A woman ruling a kingdom A woman having supreme power  An example is Wu zetian, a chinese emperor the only woman in china to ever hold supreme power over china. That's some awesome stuff. And plenty drama series have been made around her life, and its epic how she rules, and can be the most powerful.  If you make movies where women need to be the focus make them the boss, the leader, the ruler, the supreme one.  Aint nobody even women dont wanna see a women where you liteally shove it in our faces that she's the smartest one, and the most strong willed, that's awful.
لا يوجد ي الفيلم مقطع غرق بين ؟؟
so this is like a "Cube" remake or something?
Fiza bagi link bila leha tanya mlm ni nk tgok movie apa. Skli baru Trailer. Best ke citer ni korang?
The ending make me excited for the 3rd movie😃
i've watched this, and it has cool alternative ending.
Lol I just watch the theater and online version of this... And now I'm really confuse if what is the real one because the beggining and the ending of the theater movie is different from the online version...
don't care if you nitpickers thinks the movie is stupid, still enjoyed and loved it. I watched the "Extended Cut" online where its a completelydifferent climax and just saw bits of the theatrical cut to compare. I prefer the extended cut/digital version because of the twist about Claire, compared to "Amanda is Alive" twist in theaters. and it perfectly sets up for a part 3. hopefully this movie is gonna make a hell out of a franchise of it coz the solving of puzzles is very entertaining to watch.
Why is this movie have different ending?
I really hate overreacting in this movie. So annoying
I love this movie
Copy of alice in Bodoland
Bruh I haven’t watched the movie yet but I think like the next movie would be called Escape Room: Winners last wish
the  trailer is big spoiler
This movie was greatly made. Every scene was exciting. Job well done!
Same old crap. No original ideas left in the horror movie industry.
if pls anyone watched this movie lmk rate it 10/10
Alice in borderland
The scenes from 1:31 & 1:54-1:56 & 1:58-2:00 were NOT in the movie. What happened?!???
Cool twist, huh? Now, imagine how much better it would be if we didn't watch this trailer beforehand. ... 😑 ... First stage of the game: We already lost.
0:47 They definitely made some changes as I just watched the movie and Holland Roden said that line instead
seems like youve shown everything already haha
I have a link if anyone wants it
This one was a banger,Another movie will surely come and it'll be more extreme 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I just saw itthe movie and the ending is both extremely satisfying and super terrifying 👍🏻👍🏻😍😍😍😱😱😱😖😖😖
Hindi me he kya ye movie
First movie was alright, this one is just an eye roll fest...
i loved oved loved the movie... it is just amazing and a must watch
good stuff
There's so many cuts as shown on trailer but not in actual movie
Fantastic film,but DONT WATCH THE TRAILER,it gives away too much..
Mantab...menegangkan...smoga msh ad lanjutan ny...
Real gamers be like: speedrun!!!
Saw called and wanted its script and story back.
Clue was red: There are 3 men wearing a suit on that seat over there, two suits are red in a deck of cards, red truck in the sand, ok grab that red rose and fold it into a truck and place it on the diamond over there, great solved.  Ok 1 min left before gas is released, Clue was number 6, there are 6 holes in the picture over there, and there are six of us, each one of us has an R in their name, ok grab hold of that raincoat and wow we found 6 keys, put all 6 keys from the raincoat in the six holes inside that picture.  WOW we did it guys, we're saved.....Figured that all out in 2 minutes before we all died...
Hated this movie. A bunch of teenagers screaming for 2 hours. There is no tensions more of a major annoyance... stopped watching halfway though, and I usually finish watching even bad movies...
Alice in Borderland 3
This movie is God awful. The first one was at least watchable. This one seems to have been written by a monkey with a pencil and its anus, you know what that would have been much better. This movie is just s***. If you like escape rooms like I do it has a few interesting rooms other than that, there's not much good about this movie. The script sucks and the acting wasn't great but with a script like that I can't really blame the actors.
just here for indya!!!!!! wahh
Can't we get any good movies this year?
Fake saw
how woke is this?
Reminds me of alice in borderland
Only in theaters? Keep dreaming...
This was absolute garbo
This was disappointing
They literally changed the scenes of the movie...
Far fetched film in my opinion, try and be more realistic if you make another one, I can't relate to this at all I'm struggling to finish it simply because of how unrealistic it is, the pressure these guys are under, with the small time frame to escape a room isn't reasonable at all
Puts me in a room with a female and have to figure out what I did wrong..... Yeah, I am dead.
God I hate Bens voice in the movie
Gonna watch right now
Why this movie has 2 endings? Anyone?
If you watch until the end. You will know who is the real evil mastermind.  (mastermind) She even kill his mother and father.
Believe it or not this is actually really happening.
Anyone after ott release?
Wth there’s scenes from 1:55 onwards that weren’t in the movie??
India Moore is coming for the Oscars 😍
Was there two different ending versions, because the movie i watched didn't have debroh ann woll in it and the daughter locked up her dad in her cell. But on wiki the ending was different. Anyone??
Those who saw the movie knows a lot of the scenes from the trailers don't even exist in the movie! Felts a bit mislead!
Escape Rooms movies are like SAW movies...all you need is to be clever.
These sadistic fudges came back on
Aftet this claire working with saw
Who think this one is best of all its parts💯💯💯
I cant even remember part 1
Watched it. one word…terrible!
After watch the saw series in fucking tierd it became a old stuff. But after releasing these kind of movie adventure and saw make new definition
Escape Room: Now Playing In Theaters!  Jigsaw: I haven't been playing game since 2017.
I just watched this movie. But realized that 2:06 was not in the movie. Or am i tripping?
These are always fun.
Something weird just happened to me. I just got the movie for a second watch, after the first time I watched it in theatres . The movie was 50% different with new actors and a different ending. I am literally confused, did anyone else see the two different movies as well?
Alice in borderland
the trailer is the whole movie already. thanks for the summary.
I don't understand why there are 2 different storyline
Movie is super woke SJW propaganda
Just watched the movie and it’s terrible 😣
plese dub in hindi big fan of this movie
Okay now Im gonna write some spoilers of the movie I just watched, and I'd like some explanation :D                   So the first 15 minutes of the movie was in 2003 where the Puzzle Maker's wife got killed, (apparently there is no OG puzzle maker so wtf) my dude said that at some point Amanda showed up from the 1st movie and explained shit that they got her daughter need to design rooms etc bla bla, in my movie AMANDA ISNT EVEN IN IT. At some point they clarified that the puzzle maker was holding his daughter hostage forcing her to design rooms and then in the end Zoey got out, helped her escape her room and then trapped her own father and in the end killed him, forshadowing that a 3rd movie is gonna come. But like in the cinema Zoey and Ben never even got on a plane there was no plane scene, oh and there was no Ben in a tank filled with water scene... No Amanda... wtf? Help me understand this pls and sorry if someone already posted a similar one.
Anyone already seen it was it a good movie?
Looks like seen the whole movie
While all your comments are dad joke funny, is this movie actually good?
I'm a grown adult with 2 young kids, my FREE time is very valuable. To anybody who actually watch this movie; is this worth watching???
When will you release on demand?
I can't wait to see this, I loved the first one.
What is the name of the first one, if this is the sequel?
When vod or ott or online release takes place.... please comment if anyone knows??!!!!
Final fantasy be like : why you playing game if you can kill someone quickly
Can someone please tell me how I can watch this I’m dying to watch this I love the first movie and I had no idea it came out three months ago. I’ve been waiting for this! How do I watch it I’m going crazy I will literally pay any amount of money
Rr_1
you cant make a trailer for this kind of movie without spoiling 50% of the movie
Animatronics
Song at the end: Survival by Muse
When this movie is coming in HINDI  i waiting for it too much because of its 1st part. this van also watched in english but there is not so much fun as i love hindi
Bruh when is the HD quality coming out on pirate bay
I just have watched the movie only a few hours. It is very exciting, still better than the first.  However, this video is not a trailer, but a spoiler. Unacceptable
this movie was sh!t and one of the parts was copied from Bruce lee but instead it sayd ''empty your heart'' not ''empty your mind''
this movie was sh!t and one of the parts was copied from Bruce lee but instead it sayd ''empty your heart'' not ''empty your mind''
LOLLLLLLLLLL that trailer reveals everything that will happen. So stupid
No we ripped off your movie
If i was in the movie: "'I played this game. Before." "We need to solve the 🧩" "If we dont we will die." "If we do, we can escape"
Little spoilers!  The plane crash incident has not happened in this film, there will be a next film. And Minos really has great power, even the police in this film are part of Minos. 😔
I have only seen the starting of the first movie but Taylor Rusell is so good in not only lost in space but it looks like in escape room also
So many good actors playing the game 🔥
Ive been waiting 😣😣
No Way Home trailer peas
Movie: It's just a game.  Viewers: It's just a movie.   Movie: I... I know, but I can't say that.
Ok, the trailer is the movie
I will be watching this for Indya Moore only
If you like this kind of series, you should try watching Japan’s Alice in Borderland. It’s pretty awesome with similar themes! But more gruesome … it’s on Netflix!
แทบจะไม่ต่างจาก อลิซ ในดินแดนมรณะ.เลย
i wanna know who they put in charge of this trailer because it showed me the whole move lol, it told me who survives and even shows me the plot twist lmao
WHATS THE SONG THEY PLAY TOWARDS THE END😫!!!
Part three ?like the way it ended and all the stuff Zoey said…
Ben is my favourite character because his every line he says is so funny it kills me
Yeah if I survived the first time aint no way I’m going back for round two
Saw but less gore
MAJOR SPOILER WARNING!!! I noticed in the trailer after watching the movie that 2 scenes were not in it, the plane crash and the temperature room, so my theory is that the 3rd movie will be out sometime near the end of next year or the very beginning of 2023 and they have already started filming the 3rd movie
I CANT WAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT PLS COME OUT
I know im a bit late to the party I’ve been waiting for this movie for too long lmao
when hindi dubbed will release
No way home trailer
Where is trailer spider 🕷️ man
Anyone else hear Survival by muse played by opera singers towards the end?
No way home?
We want spiderman no way home trailer....🕷🕸🕸🕸
It's better to go into this movie without knowing a single thing. Don't watch the trailer
Spider man no way home teaser 🥲?
We want Spiderman's movie trailer
this series is really good at showing off all the best sets in the trailer and the entire plot and concept and like everyone who dies
I must’ve missed this in theaters - where can I see this now???
Sorry haters - this movie was so good! Needed a better acting and got it, got the big twist at the end, and a start of a 3rd movie I really hope it’s gonna be out soon, can’t wait!
When NWH trailer is coming Sony?
Please release no way home trailer 🥺
I just got back from the movie theatre with my son, and I must say that this movie was very interesting. My son and I both love horror movies and escape rooms, we together have won many escape rooms together. I suggest to watch this movie if you live escape rooms and a little horror
Does anyone recommend this or discourage it for an 11 year old with her older siblings?
Please release in ott🙏
Release Spider man no way home trailer
I remember when this game was just an app! It went from that to an actual game house (which is soooo much fun), to a movie franchise! As excited as I am to see this I will be waiting until this is out on digital. I don't do COVID releases.
so the last puzzle will be the black girl and the main character cool
Felt all scripted. Everyone always knew exactly what to do. Didn’t feel believable.
I just loved the 1st part of it It has changed my taste of movie😍
Yeah and I find it absolutely ridiculous that a few of the shots showing in the trailer one in the actual film like for example the plane crash scene, literally before the film ended both the survivors from the end of the first film ended up on the plane and it turned out to be another escape room which left us on a cliffhanger, no burning pain or anything with Show which would lead me to believe that what we saw in this trailer is possibly a snippet of the third film that they might possibly have already secretly filmed judging by the way the second film ended
Sony spider man no way home trailer release we are all angry
i think when they going to end escape room i think they should put the main villian into the game at the end
What song was that in the video
1:52 these people don't make an appearance in the movie... is this on purpose? Maybe a hint to the 3rd movie???
Tsk tsk, where's the Spider Man NWH trailer ARGHHHHH
No way home trailer
Spiderman no way home trailer plzzzzzzz
Just finished watching. Unfortunately, it's not as good as the 1st movie. Too many rooms but too little time to appreciate the puzzles on each room. But it's worth watching and still entertaining.
Trash horrible trash
Trailer Snwh?
Okay so you don't wanna disappoint us with not releasing Spider-Man: No way home trailer. Cause it is going beyond the time. But you are saying us that the previous 2 installment of the films are available on something special. Yeah right.....We want Spiderman: no way home teaser atleast.....
Better watch this than Spiderman no trailer
Taylor Russell is So Cute and a Great actress!!
ONLY IN THEATRE Le corona: escape room
Far from home trailer kaha hai?????????
Sony .... spiderman no way home trailler 😬😬😬😬
Whoever write and direct and everything about this movie is a legend this movie is INSANE AND EVERY SCENE WAS SO INTENSE and now im waiting for part 3
кагда выйдит человек паук 3 нет пут дамой  Sony Pictures Entertainment
Upload Spiderman : No Way Home Trailer Now!
I wanna watch it but I'm not sure yet, was it good? And I haven't watched the other two prequels, should I before?
Is we can see Spider-man no way home trailer in this life???
awful
this is why i dont do or like escape rooms lol
Watched the movie and ben or whatever his name is he dies in the film but they bring him back and they bring back amanda from the first film back
Wait they made a other Movie Escape Room?   I Really don't watch the movies but everyone knows what is the movie about and happens first one?
After watching the film yesterday. There is alot of footage i see here that wasnt on here
LYDIA MARTIN?!
Spider-Man no way home trailer please
I was hoping Sly & Arnie would be in this but realised it was room and not plan 😞
Where is Spider man no way home trailer 😡😡
Their definitely making a part 3 after that ending I can’t wait
Don’t waste your money IMO. Most of it is just suspense, and it’s basically used as a follow up for the 3rd movie.  New characters all die. no fulfilling ending and it all feels like a fever dream. you’ll leave the theater feeling robbed of your time and money…
It was pretty amazing and awesome I think that is like the NFL Rush Zone Fantastic story and crossover mic game!
I am totally going to watch it.
I knew it was too good to be true just because you got away in the beginning and you think it’s that easy to take down something this big that’s easy if you look at the news headline the logo is the design for the company’s logo not to mention they guy that ran off with her necklace they found all of a sudden
Where is Spider man no way home trailer.... 😠😠😠???
Where is spider man 3 trailer?
Sony Pictures Entertainment and Marvel are not listening to their audience 😡 they are not releasing spiderman no way home trailer 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Please reveal trailer spider man no way home
Trailer kab aayega spider man 3 ka
I just finished watching this movie and I freaking loved it
It spoiled the whole movie
“What is this... like a tournament of champions?”  “And we’re out, great job everyone, you’ll all be paid accordingly”
I am the biblical prophet and I just went and saw Escape Room 2 and you got my attention with the chosen one! I like the guy. Reminds me of my life with more traps tho!🤟😎❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Where is no way home trailer
Nos vale pijas esta pelicula suban el trailer de no way home
Where is no way home trailer
Release no way home trailer with Andrew Garfield
No way home trailer ?
Just one question?  Where the hell is no way home trailer😭
It’s honestly sad that this trailer practically shows the whole film and it’s PG13. That means the deaths aren’t even gory. What’s even worse is they actually show some of the characters dying in this trailer. Why?
this is just like hunger games catching fire JSJDDJDJ
Yea wonderful, now can we have the no way home trailer ? I’ve had enough 🙄😑
👁    👁     👃     👄
Spiderman trailer
I have not seen the movie but based off this trailer, i no who dies in what room. Super annoying.
Me and my cousins when we play a game in my grandmas house:
"only in cinemas"  the internet: are you sure about that?
cant wait for Cinema Summary to review this one
Please drop spiderman no way from home

RELEASE THE SPIDER MAN NO WAY HOOOOME TRAILER
Give me THE SPIDERMAN TRAILER
Guyss what is the best streaming website to watch this movie instead of netflix?
스파이더맨 노웨이홈이나 빨리 내놔 십자석들아
Today is the day GIVE ME THE NO WAY HOME TRAILER
So I just watched the movie I’m guessing their going to be a number 3 aha
First one was better
But can we talk about the fact that Indiya Moore is in here😩😩😩😩
Spider Man No Way Home Trailer!!!
Make to movie 20-30 min longer nextime It should have been Escape Room tournament of champions part 1 and net movie part 2..  bring in more people with the cast of part 1 escape together is going to be a lot of fun and exciting and a little more budget for the movie
Spiderman?
Song name???
Sequel was very lack lustre rooms felt very underwhelming and boring to watch I hope the third brings the charm back of the first
stat7fifh Up botoy
I saw the movie !! It is literally my favourite thing ever !!!
Wow I’m so glad I didn’t watch this trailer until after I watched the movie.
what is the classical song
>> No Sylvester Stallone?  Never mind then ~
Anyone know what website i can watch this free?
What's the point of watching the movie when the trailer shows the whole god damn thing?!
Why spoil the movie?
Just watched this in the theaters today! GREAT movie 👌. Defined recommend much better than part 1!
In the trailers, it was Ben who says, "tournament of champions" but it was one of the girl who said it in the movie
So much for the plane teaser
So stupid made movie. Increidible how good was the 1st part and so dumb this one. Some really stupid scenes made me go out from the movies  before it finish. P. S There are moments everybody is shouting to the rest of the players and you dont understand what is going on. Acid falls on her arm, but she  behave like it was normal water. 1 wasted hour
So they all have unique talents that help them win their first escape room?
INDYA MOORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So glad that Tom Holland is on screen again let’s gooooo:)))))
LOL
Just saw it can't wait for 3rd and 4th installments and beyond!!!!!
Saw?
This reminds me of the american version of  Alice in borderland on Netflix
Where can I watch this?
Good movie 👏
Alice borderland or this ?? Which is the real deal !?
That last scene in the trailer hits different after you’ve seen the movie.
I did ok in one of the real life escape rooms, got myself on their leaderboard. But no one was trying to kill me at the same time.
SPIDERMAN NO WAY HOME TRAILER 😢 😪
Anybody else get hype at the Jigsaw Cameo at 1:35 ?!
House of Evangelista snatching trophies again me thinks
Penny 🌹
This looks dumb
I just saw this. It was just ok and there will be a part 3
Oh, lookie!  TWO final girls.  So at least we know all the guys are killed off.
Where is it gonna release
Can't wait 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Im still not over the fact that they couldve just called it All Stars
Did this trailer just spoil the whole movie?
I'm goin to see that this afternoon
Great move. Well worth it.
It’s amazing
My baby Indya 😎
Why is it on a train and not a plane tho? At the end of the first one they were going to go on a plane and the people were planning on getting them on the plane.
Character: "what is this?!, some kind of tournament of champions?"  CinemaSins: ROLL CREDITS
Category: Gaming
Just out of a screening, it’s super fun and entertains AF when you take away the fact it’s whole purpose is to be a cheap horror flick cash grabs that’s all flash but no substance
I might have gone to see this movie if the original had been available on any of the streaming services I subscribe to. But i'm not dropping theatre prices for a sequel that i haven't seen the previous instalment of.
Saw this today, what a load of rubbish, don't waste your money, saw the Forever Purge today as well which is good. 👍
The first Escape Room movie is my all-time favorite and I'm SOOO excited for this sequel!!! :D
Stupid dumb movie with a stupid dumb ending
may be a SPOILER but i've heard that zoey and ben is the last 2 survivors as the first one this is actually ridiculous how the 2 of them managed to escape again , regardless that the other players had also escaped before and they have the same experience  so not a single one of the four players could have escaped ?!! This is not logical at all
i mean they already showed the ending LOL the 2 girls are left and 1 gets into the last room in the taxi GG nice trailer
This looks even better than the first one
Woooow amazing
Spoiler alert…its terrible
When will this movie release in hindi
I remember watching the first one. I was high as hell and it really freaked me out cause when I saw it it was just me and my three friends in the theater the whole theater was empty and we thought we were in the game 💀💀
SPOILER   So in the second movie she actually never gets over her fear of flying until the very end after she plays there game again AND WINS. Then she ends up getting on a flight to leave and it ended up being ANOTHER GAME and that’s how it ended. Gosh they will never give her a break!😂😂😂
I really hate this kind of trailers, literally spoiled the movie😃
I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS MOVIE! 10/10 would HELLA RECOMMEND. It did the first one justice
Anyone else notice that a bunch of shots from the trailer weren’t shown in the actual movie?
I SAW IT TODAY AND OH MY GOD IT WAS SO GOOD YALL GO WATCH ITTT
Hnm I really liked it, some bs moments such as SPOILERS the two girlss(not MC) dieng becuase the taxi door closed.  Stupid because the timer wasn't even zero before the acid rain.
Anyone else really wants to play this ? Just me ? Okay…
Taylor Russell is hot.
Reminds me of the kdrama called " Alice in borderland"
Okay but do I need to watch the other Escape room movies for this?
Its clear Indya moore is the psych out final third that gets killed at the last second
This is the best trailer I have ever seen loved the first movie
Oh my Gaaaawd!!!!
by the way the guy with the hearing aids died and the 2 main characters survived everybody else died and they teased the new movie at the end
If this happens to me I’m just looking up a tutorial on youtube
I’m hoping James and Chelsey survives man. Not gonna lie...
Like they weren't inspired by Saw, lol.
Who keeps thinking that’s Simon baker in the thumbnail
i think ben will die
It’s all fun and games until a rich twisted and powerful bastard takes this for inspiration. (If you read this, it’s a joke. Don’t put me in these rooms😭)
I felt like it was a mix of Saw, Final Destination and Hunger Games. Good movie!:) good plot twists. (I kinda got the some clues throughout the movie).
As much as I love him I feel like Ben will die and Zoe will be the sole survivor. Hoping I get proved wrong with a different sole survivor or multiple but this is the most likely outcome.
When I see Sony I knew it going to be good movie. I going to watch it. And get Sony rewards point with it :)
I am a little confused. This movie is about past winners playing again... but in the first movie the gamemakers didn't want any winner and the remaining people barely escaped... so all these other winners also escaped them? Hopefully the movie will answer how they escaped and I am hoping to enjoy it regardless of the little details like this!
damn this is fawked
just watched the movie it’s amazing
I just saw this movie trust the trailer did NOT reveal the whole movie
the way i’ve been waiting for this
i think they revealed to much in the trailer
Appalling.  First one was better
Don't u dare take Spiderman out of mcu I swear to God if u do prepare yourself for a lot of angered fans u just care about politics and money u don't care what the fans want that's why u guys suck butt😡😡🤬🤬
Kind of crazy how Sony will release a movie like Into The Spiderverse, and then go back to making stuff like this…
I'm the Champion and didn't die! Hands trophy and it explodes. The end of trilogy.
I’ll fucking watch it
I am still waiting for Belko Experiment Tournament Of Champions
The Category is.......ESCAPE!
The four of them died, except the both to the same survivors.
That’s a dude
I  am going to see this!!
I think i’ll enjoy this one more than the original!
Yeah they release trailer and picture for every movie but only for spider man no way home just picture
I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THEATERS. LEAVE A LIKE IF YOU ARE A ESCAPE ROOM MOVIE FAN LIKE ME ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
OMGGGGGG I'M SO EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE. I SAW THE FIRST ONE " ESCAPE ROOM" AND I LOVED ITTTT❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wait is this like The Escape Room movie the one that is coming out is this the sequel
I’m so fucking hyped for this
Finally
Just use your banshee powers Lydia.
Ok so here's my prediction, Rooms: - The Train (electricity) - Illuminus Bank (lazers) - Lighthouse (quicksand) - Destruction room (basically things got decayed and stuff) - The Traffic (acid rain) - Ben's bedroom (narrowing wall) - Fire and Water room (room filled with water and room burned) - Plane (not quite sure what's the danger here)   Rooms and death order: 1. First one is of course the train, and the one that will die is Derek, the guy with white shirt   2. Second one is the bank, and I think all of them survive but got a few bruises from the lazers   3. Third is the lighthouse, because they still have the full formation and brianna still got the injuries from lazers. I suppose they all will be sucked by the quicksand, and ended up in different places, but as for Nathan, I think he will be eliminated at this room.   4. Brianna, Rachel, and Zoey will be at the destruction room, the room is identical to the colour orange and red, we saw some glimpse of this room which are the stove that burned Rachel's hand, Brianna hugging the wall because the room got into somekind of earthquake, and somekind of decaying cave that Brianna, Rachel and Zoey climbed up to.   5. they climbed up to a sewer that leads to a road which is the traffic room, but only Zoey survived because she got into the taxi, while Brianna and Rachel died by acid rain, we saw Brianna and Rachel hugging before their deaths and Rachel's face seems like she felt sorry for Brianna because she has to feel the pain of the acid rain, meanwhile Rachel herself can't feel physical pain.    6. After the lighthouse, Ben woke up in his bedroom, he thought its a dream but he realized he's still in the game, the room started narrowing but somehow he survived and got to the next room.   7. Ben and Zoey will meet at the water and fire room, seperated room but can see each other, I think ben will die cus of drowning because the room got fill with water, after that Zoey's room got burned but I dont think she will die.  So either Zoey outplayed the game again, or she joined minos, or she got into another room which is the plane, because theres a scene Zoey's in a plane, and I'm pretty sure they released a plane scene like some months ago that turned out to be minos experimenting a new room.  - bUt iT's Just a PreDiCtIOn -
When I check my free movie app I got early access
“You’ve all played before??” < Is there another movie with the other players playing the escape room??? I already seen the first one but they should have a movie with the other people playing
Cant wait to see. Would love to see it in 3D!
So it’s erm… it’s s- saw, mint
The second trailer just spoiled the movie! It's for revenge. They went looking for the creator of the escape room trap, the champion are asking to die, at that point.
IM HERE CAUSE IM HAVING AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS FOR THAT TWIST
The same hunting for clues in this sequel to not die in a weird game. But why did they start the floor riddle with lazer beams from the beginning instead of trying out at each bar end !?.
I’m up for round 2 baby!!!
Oh my God
How to escape these rooms Subway:Pull all false advertisement to spell the word “Welcome Back!” On the board to open the vent! Lobby Room:Get the correct “Cordnetes” from the clock on the chess board after imputing the code on the ATM machine from the blood money? Hourglass Bay:Unlock the Lighthouse from the postcard by finding the anchor/Key after getting the clues from the camera and playing Tic Tac Toe? The Shack:Escape the shack before you are crumbled? Hotel Room:Escape the Earthquake by climbing up? The Playhouse:Free Ben from the tank after solving the puzzles? Airplane:Solve the puzzles before you crash to stop it! City Block:Get into the taxi before it closes on you and killed in the acid rain! And then you survive!
Why is this movie called no way out and tournament of champions
Where can this movie be found
This actually looks good...hope it is and I hope the main girl survives!!!
A simulation inside an escape room.  Sounds like the work of Zigerion scammers.
1:15 anyone know what song that is?
LYDIAAAAAAA
I really love how its the continuation of the series and not some random characters again
This movie remind me the movie "the cube"🤔
Good movie
bro. they spoiled it. Rachel dies-
My escape rooms would be: 1:The Walls Room (Walls close in on you) 2:The Tank Room (The tank fills up with water to drown you) 3:Penguin Antarctica (Ice breaks to drown you in very cold water) 4:The Vents (Every path you go behind you the vents start to close in on you to “ eat you”) 5:Electricity Train (Zaps you with electricity and selfs destructs in 5 minutes) 6:The Thriller Maze (You path starts to burn in ashes and you must find the way out) Extras: The Intermission (Find all 6 Tickets for you to start the game) HeroVille (Find all keys to end the room 1 friend is trapped in to save them before they die) MiniGames (Game Masters gives you either a 2nd chance to escape or you must be freed by the champion!)
No way home please 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 spider 🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️🕸️ who needs spider man trailer
Mom can we have saw No we have it at home Saw at home:

Dont they kill the champions in the end of every game?
I got the names of the new characters! here are the names...
good lord I must watch this
i watched the movie tday its rly good except for the end scene
This movie is already out in Australia……wow. In other places it is getting released on the 16th of JULY I better enjoy it soon. Then.
Sent here from the KING Adam Aron
Loved the first one. Can't wait
I’m probably not going to see it anyway, but it feels like they revealed way too much of the plot in the trailer.
Bro they want us to watch this movie bro i got tired of this movie keep showin up🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
The tournament of champions name should have gone to the Mortal Kombat sequel Imagine Mortal Kombat: Tournament of Chmapions
I bet there is no grisly death like Saw, this is for kids
So they let these teenagers play this dumb game hmm interesting very interesting 🤔
This will be better if it came out a show
This movie gives me the shivers
If I play this I literally will die for the sake of my life
Can’t wait to watch this In the movie theater
This is kinda remind me the purge/ nerve
Who here a amc ape
Who's here after CEO Adam Aron's Tweet 😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
AMAZING MOVIE!!!!!!!!!
This movie is just 🔥🤯🤯🤯
I’m so fucking happy they cast Indya Moore omg
Damn! This gave me Chills!🙀
Amanda’s death in the first movie was really sad to me, she tried to hang on to save her life, but she couldn’t do it. But there is one thing I don’t understand. How come we never see her body? All the others we do, but we never saw hers. I’m hyped for this movie. The first one was cool. This one looks even Better! Can’t wait!
can someone tell me the name of its prequa
I'd so died during the first round, no way I would've made the sequel.
I think it was great
Sony pictures entertainment pls dubbed in Hindi too
Cool a 468
2 more weeks.
dAMN, THIS LOOK LIKE A GOOD MOVIE. INDYA.. I SEE YOU 😘
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THEY'RE GONNA LET YOU WALK AWAY FREE AGAIN!?
Is that an orchestral version "Survival" by Muse???
Like The Music For The Escape Room It is like The End Of The World 1:48
Ok, they messed up the subway scene so bad. When the tesla coil is activated and it arcs to the body of the subway, it doesn't make more arcs inside of the subway, all it does is allow the negative charges to go to the ground, not create more arcs inside of the subway itself
It’s only game. Why you have to be mad?
Try and imagine if Plankton was the Puzzle Master.
Awesome movie I'm waiting for it  Super thriller movie 🎥 Regards tamilmannanchannel on YouTube
does anyone know the song thats in the background?
More crap from hollywood
Is this a continuation of the SAW trilogy?
Yes finally
Welcome to minos escape room! good Luck! Brown skin girl:No No No....
It's only a game. *Why yu hav to be mad?*
My mom loved the first movie we are definitely watching this
omg this trailer spoiled us!
Did you guys see that she fall down in the car at the end??????
Yep I saw the ad for this on YouTube without watching the first one and we just had a family movie night so we could watch the new one when it comes out.
i think 2:03 is the reason for the last scene lol.
I kinda looks like Ben is gonna die here.
Holland Roden is here!!!!
This reminds me of saw,but way less gruesome
IM SO EXCITED
Omg yessss
Angel Evangelista!
So it's literally just SAW....
"It's just a game bro"
FINALLY
Looks like a movie i will forget about 5 minutes after watching it.
This is literally fucking Saw wtf
There coming out with a new one omg
So it’s danganronpa but not anime
Yass
If I see one more goddamn ad about this I will scream
People cant be serious.... This movie looks like straight trash !!!!   And its pg 13? Lol oh even worse!   No no. Movies like this need to be rated R !
No reason to watch the movie after this trailer summarized it so nicely.
I can't wait to see this movie. It is going to be great.
I bet all that Danny Khan is alive and he's the architect
I cant wait to see this but Im so mad they put so much info in this trailer, I'd rather be surprised that one person doesnt feel pain and that theres a whole simulated city fake out. Hopefully theres some bigger twists that didnt make the trailer
i can only say 2 words: HOLY SH**
When second trailer?🥵🥵🥵
Can't wait to see it
“Ay what’s going on!” *Proceeds to hug the door*
I'm shocked they actually came thru with a sequel, and it looks like they seriously upped the budget.
If zoey dies in this one I’m done 😭
I know that voice crack from anywhere that Lydia from teen wolf
My goodness. I'm sitting here at 2:17 am watching Martin and the commercials came on and these are the kind of movies coming out today ? This quality of movies is just garbage . Plain and simple . Looks like I'm going to be watching a lot of Tubi . It's filled with old movies from early 90's, late 80's , a variety of older movies . The movies coming out today are just sad and pathetic . No heart or meaning in them
Reminds me of that Japanese show, Alice in Borderland.
Lmao, the first movie was shit so this is gonna be even shittier. I guess we’re just gonna start making more saw movies but worse now.
This ain’t it, Sony.
How are all the survivors young attractive people?
So… modern jumanji?
Imagine you watch this in cinemas then you were locked inside the cinema which was an Escape Room
Tamil dubbed
i'm pretty sure the final room is where zoey sees ben trapped. you can hear her scream "make it stop" which indicates she's talking to someone who has to do with the game. i think zoey and ben gets separated as what others have said ( guys have their own game and females have their own) and the last male and last female will be in the final room with the mastermind which i heard is to be claire (Isabella Fuhrman). in the last scene we see two girls seemingly die by acid rain i believe which would make it zoey the final female. zoey makes it to the attic room after and sees ben trapped and that will be the final room or a room after that but i think we all can conclude zoey and ben will be the last survivors.    (just noticed in the same room where she sees ben trapped with the water she is turnt around saying "i'm not playing your game, not now, not ever!" which could mean maybe the game master wanted her to let ben die for her to win the game. you can also hear ben saying "what makes you think they're going to let you walk free again?". that could be at the moment when he's trapped talking to her on the other side of the glass which is where the idea that the game master gave her a choice to let him die and she wins comes from.   my main problem is who is the person standing @1:55? the bear moves which leads me to believe the gamemaster is controlling the teddy bear. but that person in the room with her randomly isn't seen after 1:55.
It’s okay Holland can just tell everyone how to avoid their death because she’s a Banshee!😃
I am so excited to see Indya in this!!!
Damn I just watch Cinema Summary do an explain video on the first movie
Is it just me, or is it possible that they’re gonna get separated into “boys vs girls” down the line?
Can't wait to see
Loved the first one 9/10
alice in borderland another universe
Indya moore
Indya Moore aka Angel Evangelista better win an Oscar!!!!
Here for Holland Roden. ❤️
I'm actually excited for this ^_^
Who is coming after by seeing the telugu dubbed movie in etv
Do you guys think she will survive again?
I swear to god that everyone will figure out how to escape these rooms shown in the trailer.
This is the most shameless “Saw” ripoff I have ever seen. I’m not saying all of those movies are a masterpiece but people like them for the traps. This movie is gonna do pretty badly.
*Am I the only one wondering why they are on a train instead of a plane???*
sad i think Logan Miller die this time.
This movie gives me The Maze Runner Vibes 😆 When I was watching this movie first part I was like Why this feels similar to The Maze Runner Franchise 🤥
Excellent 👌
Chick in the white top is Hot AF. Also How TF did those two get caught in the game AGAIN.
I wanna watch this, loved the other 1
" I can't feel physical pain. Just imagine the kinds of puzzles they came up for me" *burns herself and doesn't feel it* me: *dies*
Wow, that was the quickest movie I've ever watched. Why did they just put so much of the movie in there?!?!
Starring Sal Vulcano
Carbon copy of Alice in borderland
imagine being so dumb not knowing anything, spends hours and days to finish riddles and codes, then they choose and include you in this type of room... you'd pass away easily lol
Can't wait
just watched escape room 1, so excited for this film!
whats the music in the background
Calling it rn they are gonna pull a saw 2 and one of the group is working with villians
Do You want to play game ?
1st one was enjoyable didn’t care of the ending but obviously they wanted a sequel.ummm not gonna lie this one looks bad from trailer alone.
One of the Best movie and pls do more movie like this
Im waiting yo
Escape room: *This isn't just a game*   Escape room TOC: *It's only a game*
Trash
It's 2021. Escape Room still exist.....  Me:  *"HOW MANY TIMES MUST I TEACH YOU THIS, OLD MAN!!!"*
Where os Isabelle Fuhrman?
I can't wait!!!!!!
You idiots ruined the trailer. You practically showed everything. Heres at tip, you should have simply kept it at the Train alone with a few seconds of other places as a tease. I'll pass on this till it Streams.
Escape room participants: As commuting champions we we were forced to be a part of a escape room tournament.  Billy Batson: As commuting champion I became Shazam
Is this a part two? I feel like this trailer expects us to know what happened before the events of this movie.
Well its was obvious who dies lol
I want to see Holland Roden be cast for action movies such as Fast & Furious, Mission: Impossible, Lethal Weapon, John Wick, and etc.
When are we gonna get the Spider-Man No Way Home trailer??
Yeah l be watching space jam 2 this movie look garbage
When will no way home trailer arrive
DROP THE SPIDER MAN TRAILER 🕷 🕷 🕷
You are the only production company that didn't destroy the theatrical window because you are desperate not releasing on Digital , because you sell your CRACKLE STREAMING SERVICE .. The only one i waiting is Venom and Hotel Transylvania 4 i guess ill wait for digital release of Hotel Transylvania 4 but in venom i will watch on cinema.
Well that was a good movie. The trailer seemed to have shown everything
In my to-do list to watch...🤞
When will this come out
In theaters July 16
Alright but when James A. Janisse's Kill Count of this movie will be released?
I just want to see more of Taylor Russell.
So by that final scene with the timer are they dead or what? But idk the blonde haired girl is still alive
way to ruin the ending lmao
To the people who're asking where Isabelle Fuhrman is, i got a theory:  in the first movie, there was a keymaster near the end. (see where i'm getting at?)  Isabelle Fuhrman could be the keymaster for this game. 🤔
LYDIA!!!!
Its like Saw and The Hunger Games combined 😂
So gonna put my prediction now one of them is a traitor and is working for MINOS escape room company.  Can't wait to see this movie. 😁
Just here for Holland Roden lol
My favorite game movie
where can i watch
This looks fucking abysmal
Spiderman no way home
Your channel teaches a lot, it's fun, I'm comfortable👌
Yeah this film is what I waiting for❤️❤️❤️
Just watched the first movie today. I try to stay away from movies like this that look campy based on the trailers, but I must say that it blew away my expectations. Such a wild ride. And this trailer looks amazing.
This is "Now You See Me 2" levels of ridiculous and impossible. It may be entertaining, but it looks like suspension of disbelief will need to be turned up to the max.
Rare mango found in heart shaped
Plot Twist- Zoey escapes the Escape Room and becomes a freedom fighter leading a Civil War
Oh yess...
looks like its thrilling
i've been waiting for this ever since the cliffhanger in the 1st movie man
Waiting for this one!
Can't wait to see it
2:24 hmm 😏
Omg!!!! It's coming!!!!!
I love this movie
Can someone suggest more such movies 😇
I'm so excited to this sequel:)) I have to watch this
Were is Spiderman no way home Sony?
I was wondering with how they ended the first one if there would be a second one. I wonder how close to the first one this one was shot?
I'm siked about this sequel...😲👍
Imma keep my anxiety pills ready 😅
this same alice in wonderland
DUMB
Oh no 😅
Already watch
A kind of movie I've been waiting
Sa wakas.. eto yung inaantay ko
Gokil sih ini 😍😍😍
Worth watchin
Ngl they pretty much revealed the whole movie here
They included the guy in Black Mirror😮
Trailer de Spiderman
i feel like this'll be a trilogy and it'll close on the third film grand finale style. just a hunch
I wish danny made it alive. he was my favorite character...Plus  his an expert
honestly i will be severely disappointed if ben doesn't also survive this one. was very happy to see him survive the first one and i just know they'll use his charm and likeability as a way to make the audience sad when he does inevitably die. i'm guessing ben will sacrifice himself for zoey as a way of repaying her for saving him in the first movie.
Who would actually think to call the situation they’re in a “tournament of champions” bruh
Release no way home trailer!!!!!!
Spiderman trailer, u forget, u have 3 weeks or i...
Spider-Man no way home trailer.
لمغاربة ولعرب لي يشوفو هاد لكمنطير يدخلو يديرولي أبوني مرحبى بيكم عندي نتمنى نكون خفيف على قلبكم بي هاد طلب تحية لكل مغربي

Welcome to the minos escape room
Ever since saw, i cant wait for a whole franchise of these movies.
Already released ??? I want to watch
Well we know who the last two survivors are 👀
when your studio wants to participate in the SAW franchise but isn't willing to gamble in the R-rating market
Thanks for showing the entire Movie in one trailer smh
I'm glad that they casted Lydia from teen wolf & Angel from Posé 🥺🥺🥺
CADE O TRAILER DO HOMEM ARANHA QUERIDA??
I hope lidia from teenwolf don't die here 🖤
Hi Sony Unfair  Cancel culture got me I got banned from PS4 for 7 days for hate speech. I feel I was defending myself.  Another player got mad at me for being better than them at pvp game.  This person  sent me dirty hateful nasty spiteful messages first. I returned in kind.  The guy boasted he was a Conservative. I argue that he isn’t.  If your on PS4 and see this guy The_Subway_Guy69 Watch out he will entrap you and then report you (cowardice). Now PlayStation didn’t ask me what happened and there is no way to appeal bans of this nature. Can’t even get them on the phone. I payed for PS4 I buy games both in the store and online I pay for subscription to use online features. I pay for other subscriptions that I use on the PS4 that are other companies not Sony.  Sony has blocked that account from getting online and using services (games and video). This wrong they shouldn’t have the power to take my rights to what I payed for.
I've been bingewatching episodes of Taskmaster lately, which gives this a very different vibe
is that Carlito Olivero from X Factor USA ? and he will be the first to die?
"the train just uncoupled"... Either she's meant to be a train fanatic or that's a highly unrealistic line for a teenage character to shout out.
sony releases spyder-man trailer! All the speculations about the film have broken the bales, every day a rumor comes out.
Plz dubbed telugu
“We’ve all played the game before? So what is this, like, a sequel?”
We want Spiderman Trailer
Woah this looks intense!
Who’s pumped up for Escape Room: Tournament of Champions?

Feelings like... Watching Alice in borderland on Netflix 🤍

This sequel is DOPPIER!
Waiting
Just like hunger games. All winners will play the game and beat the system.😅
Director: Okay guys, you're in an escape room, but you'll actually die when you run out of time
Finally the part 2
This movie and the original give me the vibe of japanese death games movie.       And i love it
Alice in Borderland???
This might just be me but does anyone else feel like a character was edited out of the trailer? There were a couple scenes where there was an empty space in the center of the screen, especially in the subway room.
Wheres the NWH trailer
This is cool and all but we want the spider man no way home trailer please ❤️
spiderman trailer
Wait they literally spoil like the whole fucking movie in this trailer? How are companies so bad at making trailers!?!?!?!
yeah but why show the entire movie in the trailer
2:25 *They drowning there??*
If you think about this the Escape Room series is a bit like the Hunger Games, where in the first movie two people survive, and in the second movie previous victors are put in traps
THIS LOOKS AMAZING OMFGGG
"So what is this? Some sort of ESCAPE ROOM: TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS - Official Trailer (HD) | In Theaters July 16?"

So im assuming the guy from the first movie died, from the looks from the last scene when they thought they escaped.
So is this like Hunger Games?
Like a Spoilerrr
They spoiled the whole movie 😑
I like the way they make this movie. Iit starts where the first one finished...
This trailer spoiled waaay to much of the movie ngl
Why wait to watch this movie when you can watch Alice in Borderland.  Which this movie basically took notes from.  We will probably find out this movie won't be nearly as good as the Japanese original as well.  Just like Battle Royale and Hunger Games.
No jigsaw
Just release the trailer for Spiderman No Way Home Now pls
Yes!! One of my favorite franchises. The last one was off the hook and this looks crazy lit!!!
I LITERALLY just now watched this today and was super excited for the sequel and then THIS drops!!?  I AM SOOOOO EXCITED

This kind of reminds me of Alice in borderland
Wow .....this looks 10 times bigger than the part 1 .......awsm........ Franchise lvl UPGRADE
I loved the first one will be seeing this one 2 omg Escape room 2 looks like it's on a even higher level will be watching it in the theater. 😳😳😳🙃
You mean Escape Room: All Stars Season 1?
I swear I thought Isabelle Fuhrman was supposed to be in this... What happened?
Its Escape TRAIN😀
That acting is just atrocious. But hey I hear James Frain’s in it. He’ll probably be the only plus to this film.
Train se achha ek ghar me aisa game hota to maza aata
My favorite movie
I can't wait to watch
I'm Most waiting for this movie 🔥. Will release in official Tamil dub ???
Omfggggg INDYA MOORE YAAAAAAS

I did close the video to the half way too much talking.. Stupid a$$
Do you believe in ghosts?
Wooooooo🔥🔥🔥🔥
I don't know why it reminds me of "Table no 21".
trash rick

How about part 3 of Jumanji? … sound good?
Waiting for sinister6💯🔥🔥🔥
They just showed the whole movie in 2 min. No need to spend money.
Finally the wait is over 😍

If one character says the title of the movie, it's not a good sign.
*Awesome movie*
I feel lik they gave way too much away in the  video
Cant waidddd
So the bald guy didn't survive the train trap since he didn't appear in the next scenes?
Oh nice, another Saw movie 😂
I loved the 1st one, i hope this one is even better
Finally season 2
excited to watch this one
YES!!! I WAITED A LONG TIME FOR THIS
My favrt movie
Damn, seeing my girls Lydia and Angel in here got me on edge!!! Especially at the end of the trailer
uhm this trailer kinda sucks ngl! i mean i’m DEFINITELY watching this but there’s too much spoilers about the room designs which is my favorite part on the first film. plus the reveal at the end -_-
What an epic trailer
This has like..  alice in borderlands feel..
THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE VIBES
Was Waiting for one like this for a long time
Just match the movie it's awesome 😁😂
INDYA MOORE!!!!!
Its too be honest from this series..!
Outstanding ❤️
Nice, I liked the first one
Me every morning 2:15   Then I realize, its the same depressed life.
Is that Indya Moore?
I'm never escape from this movie 🍿🍿❤️❤️
"So what is this? Like a tournament of champions?"  *looks into the camera*
So excited
finally! it's hereeee!
The end is dead..........😵
Yes!!!!!
I get the feeling of Alice in Borderland series.
Ahh..... I have been waiting for so long...
Yess! Finally 🙌🏻
YYYEEESSSSSZZZ.. FINALLY
Since nobody can really go to an actual Escape Room, we’ll bring one to you in the form of a movie… why?! 😐🤦🏻‍♂️
People are waiting for pubg tooo......do pubg next😕😒😒😒
I've seen this concept before in a netflix series alice in borderland but still trailer looks good.
I love this...
Waiting to watch this movie for a long time
Finally its coming 😃😃😃
Waiting for this many days
I've literally seen the whole movie in this trailer 😂
Did anyone want to see a sequel? I mean the movie was good but it certainly wasn't logical at all and for a movie in which people have a battle of wits having little to no logic is just sad.
i cant freaking wait
I WANNA WATCH THIS SO BADD, take my money already
This gives me a Danganronpa 3 vibes
June:conjuring July: old, escape room 😍
The sequence I was dying for ❤️
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Heavy gamer ho  bhai
They are really the luckiest of the lucky
Just take my money 💰💰💰
YEAH I’M EXCITED
ok... I think this needs to be a marvel movie "hear me out" In Marvel comics there a guy called "Arcade" who is paid to make crazy murder world escape rooms to kill people any super, villain, other. I mean why would anyone spend a billion dollars setting up what you saw in the trailer to kill 5/6 random nobody's, but if you're trying to kill a superhero family member or trying to trap the hero or villain. this made more sense on the scale of the trap. How big and how long did it take to build what you saw in this trailer and how many workers did it take to set everything up and dress the rooms. and the last shot where they are on the StarTrek holodeck WTF?. This was why SAW was more believable as a single person could make the traps in that franchise over the weekend in their garage.
Minos stands for Madness Insanity Not for the timid Oh you’re dumb to do it again Stupidness at last
Did anyone notice the theme song?  It’s muse guys!
WHY does Sony ALWAYS give away the final ending scenes of their films?!?! I fucking hate them for that.
When I thought this movie couldn't get better!
Waiting End soon....
I cant wait to watch this movie.
Today i download 1st part...
If I was in the same situation I don't think I would have survived
What’s the song they use in the trailer
This looks so intense, I LOVE IT
maze runner type of shiiii
I loved the first movie can't wait for this one
Wow 😍😍
This looks like Alice in Borderland
Does anyone else feel they should be in this situation?
This was supposed to come out in 2020
I am so excited for this😍💯❤
SUPER EXCITED!!!! The first one was awesome!!!
I would be surprise if the footage in this trailer were for the promotion or just get cut just like the Captain America, Black Widow, Black Panther, Falcon, Hulk and the Wakanda Army running in the Infinity War Trailer
I will never understand why they show everything and everyone who’s gonna fucking die in the trailer 😐 I was watching this genuinely curious and seemed pretty good but just by finishing the trailer I feel like I’ve already watched the whole movie and I know who’s gonna die already so thanks a lot I will not be spending money to see this 😐
Ah, this is the same plot of Alice In Borderland.  Play the game or die.  Death will be in each game.  Solve the clue to win the game or everyone dies.  No one knows who is the game master. It gets a season 2. Movie gets a part 2. Both r game of champions.
I might be wrong, but isn't there another movie with a plot something like this? like the winners OMG THE HUNGER GAMES ISN'T IT?   sorry I realize while typing lol
“What are we? Some kind of... Tournament of Champions Squad?”
Trailer Spiderman No Way Home
This one is about to be better than the first. And the first was really good
I wasn't even aware ... 2nd part would be coming.. first one was meh.. but it alright will watch this too

One of my favourite movie!
Whooow🎉🎉🎉 it's finally realease
Ohh hell yeah excited to watch❤️
This is just the trailer. But It's already epic.
That's why Escape Rooms is not that famous anymore in my country because of this movie
release A Mouthful of Air trailer now
IS IT ME OR DOES IT LOOK TAYLOR RUSSELL'S CHARACTER WENT FROM BEING SMART IN THE FIRST FILM TO BEING A DUMBASS ALL SHE CARES MOST ABOUT IS TAKING DOWN THE ORGANIZATION WHO CREATES THE GAMES AND GETS SOME OF OTHERS KILLED ALONG THE WAY.I MEAN THE MOVIE LOOKS GOOD,BUT TO ME THAT'S WHAT THE PLOT LOOKS LIKE.
This Looks so good can’t wait till July gets here so excited!
I just watched the first one like 5 minutes ago and now I find out they're making another one.
Jigsaw: Am i a joke to you?
Wow... Zeoy comes again.
So the stewardess from previous movie gonna be one of the contestants is it???
the sequel is official! my sister and I have been waiting! Love, from India!
Holland Roden❤️
Ah. It begins. The sequel-vaganza that will bore us to death. Please find original ideas, Hollywood.
Did it just show spoilers?  Bold move, I like it.
kinda like the 75th hunger games....
Teen Wolf and Pose fans please rise
This is is like Hunger Games: Catching Fire
This series/concept is way better than the saw franchise
Actually super excited for this despite having no faith that this would actually get a sequel
I cant waittt
I can't wait 😬
INDYAAAAA MOOORRRREEEE
basically what if Jigsaw made an Escape Room game
Oh yeah! This is way bigger than last time! 💥
yes
Why do only horror movies come out on my birthday? I hate horror. I saw the trailer because I didn't think it was going to be a horror movie.
Zoey Davis: "aaahhh sh!t, here we go again" wkwkwwkwkwkwk
i see lydia from teen wolf and angel from pose. will definitely watch
I've been waiting for this.
🔥🔥🔥
Everybody: dying  The creators of the game:  It's just a game💁
No 1 time pass movies
the champion will recruited by Raiden to enter Mortal Kombat tournament
Very super nice 👍🏻!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They legit making another?
But the real question is: Where is Isabelle Fuhrman? And more importantly: How is she going to die this time?
Wow
I'm hype first one was good this could branch off into more movies if this is as good as it looks bigger stakes crazier rooms can't wait.
So it’s like Saw but PG
This franchise is the new SAW
The movie series we never knew we needed
I believe that the guy is the main Villain. I have a little doubt on him scince the last movie.
Oh I loved the first movie and I love this trailer! I can't wait to watch it. This is Awesome!!!
Makes me think of Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward.
"WHO IS DOING THIS TO US" John Kramer- Hello Zoey I wanna play a game"
Angel Evangelista has made it far mama !!!!!!
Jigsaw wanted to play a game, but little did he know Jigsaw would be the one playing the Puzzle Master’s game.
first one was a art cant wait to see the next movie
I'm so fucking hyped.
WELCOME TO JUMANJI! 🤣

More dog poop 💩
I want to play a game 🤡
Saw on crack. I dig it
I could not believe that there are movies coming in 2021 despite the 2020 halt.
മലയാളികൾ ഉണ്ടോ,, ഇത് ഒരു പൊളി പൊളിക്കും,,, 👍🏻👌🏻😍
Came for Taylor Russell, Indya Moore, Logan Miller and the fact that the first one was great. Stayed because this one looks even better.
Why do they always show a character dying in the trailer? I don't get it. I don't need this much information specially from a movie that i been waiting for ever. I love the 1st one, this one is wayyyy over the top but looks interesting and good. Can't wait.
Creo que ya vi toda la película en este tráiler
"What is this a tournament of champions" Me: He said it, he said it!
where is venom
My genre. Finally.

I wish Deborah Ann Woll actress character play as Amanda Harper. Was in this sequel using her military surviving skills to beat this game. Too bad she never had a chance at this to survive.
😆I have been waiting so long for this sequel I loved the first one so much
Omg Again!!!!!!!
Interesting use of Survival by Muse
🤯🤯
holland roden is in it you bet i'm watching it
Perfect example of Hollywood being out of ideas. Then they wonder why revenue is in the shitter.
Thala nenga rendu perum vaaga thala
i mean if anyone has to be casted to scream, of course it has to be holland roden
I hate trailer when to much spoiler
I find it kinda sus that Kill Count made a video on the first movie a few days before.
This Trailer reminds me Final Destination franchise
Well this looks incredible! I've been waiting 2 years for this!
Looks fantastic can't wait
so saw
Part  2  escape room
MUSE
hungry food 2021 version
Damn I can’t wait to see this.  It’s crazy how the first one and the second one is leagues better than the saw franchise.  In a way this is what saw could have been if they actually funded the franchise and hired big actors
Okay
Woahhh 🔥
More hotel transylvania movies are released, please, sow much people love hotel transylvania
FINALLY !!!!!!!!!
I watched James kill count like yesterday, so this is ironic.
Interesting than the first one😯(for me😆)
This is my favorite game movie and Alice in borderland when it comes to series
I think that this is the only ‘Escape Room’ with a literal sequel. I may be wrong.
Where is subtitle ???????
You just gotta love popcorn movies. 👍🙂
i only watch the trailer and i already now who lives and dies
So this is basically like SAW but Family friendly?
I JUST REALIZED THAT SHE'S IN LOST IN SPACE OMGGGG, SHE'S GOOD, I LOVE HERRRRR

So is this like saw 11
0:48 - Who else though of Movie Pitch Meeting and Ryan saying 'Thats the name of the movie' lolll
I need them to continue for sequel
"we all survived for a reason"  MC who literally was supposed to die in her game: Uh yeah yep tha-that's right mhm.
It spoil everything.... i recommend not to watch this Trailer!
Dubbed in hindi
Finally inner peace 💯
John Kramer a.k.a. Jigsaw : "Hello there. Do you want to play a game?"
Cool, I just saw the whole movie
Mmmhhhmmm reminds me of Alice in borderland
Woooooow
Fantastic sequel
She reminds me of lost in space.
Take care of Americans
🤩🤩👌👌
This movie has impressed me a lot...👌😍
The bad thing about the trailer is that you can figure out the order in which they are going to die
Hell yeah 🔥
cool movie ✌🔥
Hindi me hai kya.  🥺
Taylor Russell is so beautiful 💞😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Calling it now, one of them is planted by the organizers

Any game into a movie huh? Is minesweeper, Oregon Trail, or solitaire next?
Escape Room meets Catching Fire!
Wtf that literally gave away so much that trailer barely left anything to the imagination
I'm impressed
Spider man no way home  Add cover sony
I think they showed almost a minute too much in this trailer.
You guys have Wootan Yuu !!!
How it got sequel, and belko project didn’t?
I'm so hyped I loved the first
Did this trailer reveal a lot to us🤔
its says a lot bout the movies lol
I am big waiting for this movie
Sony watched saw franchise and just said: what if we make this?
2:13 I think ben is dead in this scene. sad.
Lol. What a fantasy of directors.. what the director think of audience, age 10, oh sorry, nowdays they are also matured to laugh at this crazy childish fantasy 😅
Why they revealed so much duh
O man Love it Again 😍🇧🇩
I've waited for so long for this movie.
I think Ben is going to die, I didnt see him him in the final trap when they thought they escaped 😢
Ready player one, JUMANJI, Hunger games, Tron legacy are my favourite one❤️❤️
PERFECT
Well now I don't need to see the film, I just watched it.
Can't Wait!  The first movie was such a surprise and so much fun.
2 years 🤬
escape room: all stars
Wellcome back... Well   Comeback 😁... Comeback Well...👍
The devilish bedroom postoperatively trouble because mayonnaise anatomically grip apropos a ablaze shingle. caring, dear sun
This is going to be some real thrill 🔥 🔥
SO THIS SEQUEL IS CUBE, RESIDENT EVIL, SAW, NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, & FINAL DESTINATION ALL ROLLED UP INTO ONE...       YES PLEAAAAAAAAASE!!!!!!
Final Destination + Saw + Hunger Games  = Meh
they spoiled who dies in the movie
This looks better then the first one:)
Movies like this always scares me but also its intresting...
The Rebellion is looking for new recruits today! Who will join us? ✴
Finally, the first trailer. It seems the suspension got doubled than last time.
I don't expect any sequel from this *anyway, its gonna be best...*
“I wanna play a game.” 😁
Como cuando Sony decide sacar trailer de Escape Room y no de Spiderman No Way Home
Its only game? Yeah TOOK YOUR FUCKING LIFE
If SAW is indie this is the AAA version
Yea!
"TORMENT" Of Champions ....... These movies are good.  I think you could have left  the last part at 2:19 out. spoiled it !
The person that created the game having enough technology that will help better the world instead they are doing this   FUCKING BRILLIANT
THESE GAMES LOOK BETTER THAN THE 1ST MOVIE
I seen the 1st "escape room" how do they escape this one ?
Yeahh. Finally... I like it
This reminds me so much of saw movies, i love it. Actually cannot wait for this movie!!
Saw 2021?
$AMC TO THE MOON!!!
Yo this actually made my day I thought it was coming out next year but this Summer hey that's fine by me this will be a good year for movies
i enjoyed the first movie and will probably enjoy this too but i hope they don't drag it like Final Destination or Fast saga. some stuff should just have a beginning and an end.
I really hope this series goes on forever kinda like the Saw franchise
muse survival
Guarantee one of the "players" set up the escape rooms and they "play" along.  Calling it now...but definitely watching it
Discount saw
Finally the wait is over
The trailer Spider-Man 3: No Way Home
Lol this is fucking awful
I like how these movies are very well produced and made. I like the first movie.
PG SAW
I wanna escape my screen haha gotem ligma dab
I hate how trailers have mini trailers at the beginning.
FINALLY 😌
I like my diet Saw
They really just spoiled how Ben dies.  He obviously gets stuck in a trap where they have to try to solve his puzzle for him, but since they can’t. Ben dies a sad death just so Zoe could have an emotional moment. Unbelievable, they are really killing all 3 men first huh.
I'm so excited! I like first movie and I already like sequel!
Ah, yes. The return of PG-13 Saw
Holland’s character better not die
Why would you ruin a good plot twist at the end Sony?..who the hell approves these trailer edits? You can tell who dies when. Still will watch it but the trailer revealed the whole movie.
Give away the whole friggin movie why don't ya??? That end,,with the sewer??? What the hell guys??? That woulda been an AWESOME twist to see in the theater/for the 1st times... The 1st one was surprisingly damn good. However, its sad cuz when a trailer tends to show way too much like this one, its a sign of a weak movie....  GREAT JOB!
So a generic trailer that spoils twists of the end. Why the f* are people giving likes to this kind of crap?
I searched for part 2 right after watching the 1st...back than there were no news about it I was so disappointed  But now its finally coming
I can tell you rn the guy who survived in the last movie is going to die here.
Who let The Riddler out?
I would die instantly if there was a room based on rubix cubes and how quickly you can solve it.
Rupaul’s Drag Race: All Stars
the cancer is back
Omggg
Some sort of The Cube meets the Saw.
First one was horrible. No doubt this will follow in its footsteps.
Super excited!!!
someone please call scott mccall and stiles
The first one was cool this one I might dig
imagine being stuck on a train with a hot chick
"pg-13"  Pass
i am in
I really liked the first Movie it was that good
Woowww 😍😍😍😍😍
Ya ubique 3 muertes en el trailer :(
I hope this happens to the Q train I take so I can skip work 😞
Looks intriguing. Hoping the traps are going to be creative as well as the script.
Come on all stars ⭐️!
Thats why I named my room "Escape Room" no one comes in these days !! even the hotel owner is scared af
What a bumer ........... they spoiled everything
What did they group of people do to anger the Sorcerer capable of designing these rooms?
I loved the first movie except for that stupid ending hopefully this makes up for it!!
Live or die make or choice.
can't wait to enjoy this turd
"So what is this? Like a tournament of champions" *roll credits*
The first one was surprisingly good.
This one looks like a blasts!!
Been waiting for so long
Logan Miller has definitely changed since the last film... and love Simon but I still hate him from that
I didn’t expect a sequel for this at all but I’m interested
Waiiiiitttttiiiing👍
Welp I feel like the bald guy already died at the train room, and guy with jacket died at the laser room... lmao I hope this one is more fun than the first one and more survivors too
yes. ✊
i forgot the final girl from the last movie (i think it was zoey or something like that) but if she dies im gonna cry
First one was extremely solid, so I have faith this one will be as well, because it looks so good
They missed the trick by not calling it 2rnament of Champions.
Kinda excited for this one I really enjoyed the first one
They’re gonna kill Ben aren’t they
What is this? Some kinda tournament of champions? -Deadshot from Suicide Squad 2016
Please drop Spider-Man trailer really soon
Wow lovely first part was nice and my favorite film I Was waiting for This Movie Sequel and Now see this trailler I am waiting 😍🤩
They just spoiled the beginning...
Please release Spiderman no way home trailer
Thanks for showing the whole movie and the deaths of the characters.
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait!!!!!!!!!! Bigger and better than number 1.
Hope this won't be a disappointment, you guys want to turn this into fast and furious
Is that survival by muse in the background?
IT COMES OUT SO SOON!
Looks so much better than the Saw Franchise. The tasks they have to solve are so much better, the Cinematography (i hope it's the right word for it i'm not sure) is amazing. The first one was already amazing. Can't wait to see it.
We will be watching!
You can tell the guy in the white tank top dies 1st as he's not seen in any of the  group shots except the subway scenes...
"This is way bigger than last time"   "Gotta try something right?"
Ready or not Here they come
MAKE THIS IN 3D
Thats odd I was just talking about escape room 😳
Jigsaw 2 😱
Lydia and Carlito, omg 😍😍
Oh man I loved this movie
Can't wait to see it
this is gonna rule
actually excited for this! so happy we dont have to wait months and months to see it only! less than 2 months away!!! been waiting since 2019!!!!! looks good!!!!
Did you really have to do the title-drop *like that*...
I look forward to it, the 1st movie was my favourite in 2019, so I hope it can be a great triology like Cube was back then :)
A game that John Kramer wishes he had the time to build.
Holland Roden deciding to join the cast after appearing in a rip off of Escape Room after her disaster in Follow Me last year. Escape Room was okay but they didn't need to make an over the top sequel.
I like how modern trailers reveal all of the surprises so we don't have to go see the movie. I watched for 2:00 minutes and I already know who makes it to the end of the movie and who dies. Congratulations Sony, you ruined another film before it is even released. Good job.
The first one surprised me with how good it was and how much I liked the characters so I hope this one does the same thing.
❤️❤️
For what it is, this is gonna be great
Waiting every second for 2 years since announced
Let’s gooooooooooo
This looks good
Omgie yesss pt 2
I feel like by showing the City Room it spoiled the death of the other characters which makes me kinda sad.
It seems dangerous than the 1st part🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Finally 🥳🥳🥳🥳 I'm waiting for this
I'm excited for the sequel!! First one quite ok.
I can’t wait to see this. This is a great trailer.
🙌
Unique Story that's great
Omg it's surprising trailer my fav movie escape room
FINALLY!
Waiting for this sequel so badly The first movie ended with a insane cliff hanger
Same problem as first trailer where it is really spoilish
I hope this is good 😍
bro, I watch the first one about 1 month ago and I was waiting for 2 but here it is.
First one was so cool can't wait for it
I just loved it, waiting eagerly for this part 🔥this time we have the think very very very far & different from 1st movie
oh i know lean ain’t gonna be happy about this one
Thanks for spoiling me all the movie
I don’t remember the first one, other than I kind of enjoyed it. So I guess I’ll probably see this one, because why not.
Idk how they got the money to make a sequel, but looks like this one will be the last most def
OKAEEEEEEEEYYYYY!!!
Teenwolf fans are gonna watch it because of Holland Roden(lydia)😫😫❤❤
Spoilers tho.
Some of the 438 shots in this trailer were more than eighteen frames long. This is unacceptable! Next time, make sure the editor has a steady supply of Red Bull and cocaine. ☺
Hindi 🙏🙏???? Plzzzzzzzzz
So that's it? We some kinda tournament of champions?
I have been waiting for episode 2 like finally 😍
It was terrifying 🔥🔥😊👏👏
First one yes. This is just stupid
This is giving me Alice in Borderland vibes
Maybe the bad guys are trying to appease the gods
Best
I forgot the first movie even existed
Wow
"I want to play a game." Oh wait wrong movies.
So far I know there are 4 Escape Room movies  Escape Room (2017) with a killer with a mask Escape Room (2017) with six friends Escape Room (with Deborah Ann Woll, first movie of this one) Escape Room: Tournament of Champions
not will be good as alice in borderland
Yahoo for a bigger buget!

This trailer gave away so much especially the last part. Would've been a good plot twist tho

So is this trying to be the new SAW, Final Destination, Conjuring and Insidious franchise?
They just showed the whole movie bruh don’t even have to watch it
"It's only the game"  Some games with sad moments: We don't do that here...
Decided to watch the first movie today, just finished and searched if a sequel was coming out. This trailer came out the same time I started watching the movie.
Even though this is probably going to be similar to the first one, this movie looks pretty good and intense.
"Let's spoil the whole movie in the trailer. Remember to put the plot twist at the end of the clip."
This trailer gave A LOT AWAY😬😬
Waiting for tamil dupped
YESSS INDYA MOORE my baby is finally getting the recognition she deserves 🥺🤍
I am very much looking forward to this movie.

You don't know how much I waited for this
FIIIIRRRREEEE I CANT WAITTT
I feel like this movie is gonna be a mix of *Maze runner* and *Jumanji*
Escape room UCL version 😁
I fucking cringed at "So what is this? Like... a tournament of champions?"
The game Looks Different this Time and Much bigger and Badder than The First.
I’m guessing there’s gonna be some sort of time jump after they got on that plane...
Unique Content and High level VFX this movie is going to bee Super Awesome 💯
Yessssssssssss I am soo freaking excited
Escape Room : Quarter Quell
I NEED TO KNOW HOW THEY ESCAPE THE ROOM
Thanks for showing the whole plot
I Thought that was Zendaya at 0:16
Looks like the Spider-Man trailer aint coming soon
Where’s Isabelle Fuhrman?
Finally after 2 ½ years!
I'm actually looking forward to this. It's slowly becoming a less gory SAW franchise, with better innovative traps.
First one was a guilty pleasure of mine. Feels like this could be this generations Saw/Final Destination franchise
I was waiting it since the first came out! Amazing 😁
I am excited for this ...
Can we have Hindi dubbed
The first part was really good, hoping the same for 2nd.

I was litteraly thinking about this like 2 seconds ago; I was like “I wonder if/when that will get a sequel” I’m a god
I hope they won't release a another trailer
At this point someone’s race and gender is a spoiler... cause guess which one gonna die outta the white guys and women of color lol

This is more Difficult than the First One😬😳

YOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Again a masterpiece
I'm so excited for indya Moore!!!
The first one was very good and this one will be epic. Do you want to play in Escape Room?
Sony plz release spiderman no way home teaser.
So what is this, some sort of suicid... I mean tournament of champions?
The first movie was one of the few movies that gave me the creeps(excluding old horror movies) mostly because something like this could actually happen to anyone and we'd never know it, I hope the sequel gets better
Ok Sony I see you, just make sure that teaser for SNWH on Friday is fire
Holland Roden aka Lydia from teen wolf..my favourite .... Definitely goona watch this one.....
Man this spider-man no way home trailer looks weird af
This series really is "Can we have Saw at home?"
I am so ready for this man 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱

Wow nice 👍🏻
This trailer literally gave us the entire movie
This is way bigger than last time!
ESCAPE ROOM Movie is like it's Name😍😍
Yes finally! The first movie was amazing, can’t wait for this sequel!
Believe me or not, when I watched this movies part 1 and searched for Part 2 . Even though it wasn't released but downloaded Escape Plan 2. I was like how could the concept be so different. No previous cast in here.  I was baffled but later I realised I've downloaded the wrong movie.
Imaging movie
the first one was so much fun, this looks like an XL version
I accidentally watch this movie and love it
From looking at this trailer, I like the rooms in this more than the ones In the last one
Waiting for spiderman trailer
Gives me jigsaw vibes
This is so great. It's fucking amazing. I can't wait
GIVE US THE SPIDERMAN TRAILER

1:21 The Continental
This was unexpected
Not seen the 1st film but this looks like something i could randomly watch one Sunday afternoon
Is it more or did the trailer reveal too much of the movie.
Excited!
Definitely watching this one!
Wow 😳, more horrific than before
That scene at the end of the trailer is dope!!!
Definitely forgot about the first one. Can’t wait for the 2nd. But where is the Spider-Man trailer???
I really forgot about the sequel lmao
Didn’t think there would be a sequel but wow , I mean the first one was a success
Spiderman no way home trailer
🤩🤩 waiting
We saw where everyone will die in the trailer, no need to watch the movie then
"What are we, some kind of Suicide Squa--err I mean what is this, some kind of Tournament of Champions?"
When will Venom 2 trailer...oh wait...sorry...old habbit
Well the fist one brought back this franchise and I hope this will surpass the expectations
I'm so hyped for this. This is gonna be so epic
I just watched Escape Room Yesterday on Netflix. I’m hype for this one!!!!!!!!!!
Cool
damn I was so eagerly waiting for this....
i'm so excited!!
What is this "Some kind of Sucide Squad"
“Woah finally this god damn movie released”  - victor “god damn” sulivan Oh you liked that here’s another one : Sony : we’re proud  t- Sully : hey , Sony where wtf is Nate and Godamnit  it  I look hideous Ed without this moustache Sony : eh
Been waiting for this 😍😊
You seriously need to stop the Trailer before trailer
It looks like we're gonna see the game master's real identity. Also I'm so excited.
I waited so long for this
"So what is this? Like a tournament of champions" has the same energy as "so that's it, huh? What, we some kinda suicide squad?"
Looks entertaining and the first was okay, but...  1. They showed way too much in the trailer.  2. When he said “what is this, a tournament of champions?” My eyes rolled so hard it hurt. I hope the rest of the dialogue in the movie is a little bit better.
Indya Moore!!!
very horrific 😳😳😳😳😳
yes i always knew there was gonna be a part two
Spiderman!!!
i like the first one so hopefully this will be good
Kadak bhai ❤️

Release the Teaser for Spider-Man No Way Home!!!
YESSSS
I appreciate the budget but you know this is the next Saw and looks way ott. Torture porn and they're gonna make a ridiculous franchise out of this (btw the trailer shows who does / doesn't survive along the way- poor editing)
Spiderman trailer?
Why does the main guy look like Jason Segel
Watching trailers are super easy barely an inconvenience
Sony smashing it again 😜 can’t wait
Carlito Olivero!!! Wow man he's come far!!!
A trailer without an announcement
