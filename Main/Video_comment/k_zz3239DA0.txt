Word man, don't understimate the small little guy with a hugeee brain
We sent Nancy pelosi, the woman that is, by tracking her insider trading practices, is out 100% for herself and is on camera saying she wants her "crumbs" back basically insulting 3/4 of the country cause she has such a disconnect between gov and the American population, we send HER to investigate/assess/negotiate our most important asset for the future? Are we the people seriously this freaking stupid that we continuously let our so called leaders screw us over at a fundamental level. WE NEED NATIONALISTS not socialists negotiating with our enemies. Nationalist believe in there home county so much that they'll risk their lives to protect the American way of lives. Socialists will sell us out for personal gain cause they want a one world gov anyway so why not sell secrets to China. Wake up people. The people that are supposed to keep us safe are same people that got us into this problem in the first place. If you want to have a bleeding heart, that's fine, but when you're away of life becomes threatened eventually, you'll then realize holy crap we need to defend ourselves from an invading super power that only became a super power because of us and our policies and voting practices.
This explains nothing other than the fact that US government and agencies are stupid! China will beat US’s ass off if things keep going like that!
The chip and ice cream ghost from adventure time possessed Johnny in order to make this episode.
I love reading Micheal Crichton (the guy who wrote Jurassic Park and Congo) when it comes to topics like this.  The way he describes how technology was outpacing itself every couple years back in the day was incredible and the feeling is almost lost, even though it keeps going. I guess when it outpaces what the average person will do with it, it is hard to see it. Plus when we get down to the size of atoms it cant really get smaller.
A video made for a flex. Weird haha 😂
dont forget without germany's carl zeiss no dutch machine would work, since these lasers need their lenses and Carl zeiss is the ONLY company in the world ABLE to produce them; which can be sold to the US if the germans and dutch stop that there is no prozessors for US and china. lets slap some tarrifs on that and boom both crippled to dust mirrors and lenses for US military satelites = carl zeis. Without european especially german engineering the US would still be stuck not as a 3rd world country that it is but far at the bottom. Why did the US import all the important nazi scientists and pardon them? right without them no nukes and no rockets. The US pride is such a farse dont forget the white US are poor exile europeans trying to get a better life and put all their saving into the crossing. But suddently you claim to be german/irish/frensh/italian etc. nope u not maybe your great great great grandparents. just face that the US wouldnt be the US withou ALL that european tech. I hear americans claim the invention of the car or TV for them... nope its european, drilling oil? european.
Your stuff is so good and holds up better than gold. You and your team are amazing.. Real, honest, important shit from a great perspective.

America is fucking SCARED of china 😂
Johnny is so Nationalistic about America, you can hear it in the way he talks about other countries, he first had to make America look like the pioneers before he started to give any other country its dues   What a muppet, A Mormon muppet
You can't see the war we are all In because its Invisible control of the mind of man.
Are you still a Mormon?
I don’t understand why Taiwan would sell chips to China when it’s their sole goal to take them over.
"The reason fabs look like this"... Um, not well explained. Fabs look like a virology lab because the wafers can be destroyed by particulate matter in your breath. I toured Infineon's fabs in Dresden. At the time I was a smoker, but even with the hermetically sealed machines, the hermetically sealed suits, and the hermetically sealed building, I couldn't have a cigarette for 12 hours before entering the building. Why, because some small piece of dust might escape my lung, my suite, the down draft air filtration system, and find its way into one of the sealed machines landing on a wafer and destroying it.
Great video. Your the best
Stop relate semiconductor to taiwan.  Taiwanese not owning top 7 tech companies in taiwan.  Majority share owned by US private funds
Ty for your work  Much Appreciated..
Bingo
14:44 missed an opportunity. Taiwan's now in the game, and semiconductors are its claim, name, fame.. not "are now becoming a geopolitical bargaining chip"
Pass!!
This is so educational, including for high schoolers
Everything's computer
Any Updates?😊
We don't use nearly as much electronics. I could go without.
Great journalism ! 👏🙏🌎
❤
man way to advertise I cant even skip forward its apart of the video, good on you.
this guy makes journalism cool. nice personality
I’m seeing this in real life now, going to more and more silicon factories in Washington state
Nice
Good content, thank you.
And who gave Russia all the chips for their rockets…. Hmmm
1:02 I prefer French fries myself.
New coldwar?
But this is not true saket explained right  https://youtu.be/QmaxkC6V7fs?si=yjjE2hIfqPJz7znE
land of the brave....
One of the best video ever. Thanks for your magnificent journalism.
Since the day this video came out to June 29, 2025,  $10,000 in NVIDIA on Jan 18, 2023 would be worth ~$80,884 today. $10,000 in TSM on the same date would be worth ~$26,597 today.
I have most tech skills.
We need a recent update if its a good time for one :D Great Video!
I think that U.S. interest in protecting Taiwan will end once they repatriate fab capability.  At that point, however, they won't export chip technology to Taiwan.  But it is possible that Taiwan could continue being a chip power house for other nations, assuming that other nations aren't scared off or impeded by a blockade.  It is also possible that China will throw a lot of money at Taiwan to make use of its chip technology, but in order for Taiwan to play ball, they would have to burn bridges with the U.S.  So the U.S. might still have incentive to protect Taiwan.  If U.S. fabs pull ahead enough, and if Taiwan's falls behind, that incentive may wane.  Perhaps that's where China steps in with a lot of money to keep Taiwan's capability modernized.
This is old.  China already has chips
This is ans awesome documentary  news update. I was wondering if the China is getting these advanced chip tech can they implement tracker or shut of switches or is that not posable to do
Wow j ai de la misère en général avec l autorité so ce mec là c est pas l autorité c est la raison car ses intentions sont claires et donnent le sens que leur métiers devrais avoir c est la seule autorité que je pourrais suivre ce gars là c est pas un voyous c est un homme les voyous sont pas des hommes mais ya des voyous partout ... Ce monsieur dit exactement ce que je penses t as des fonctions habite les dans le fond tjrs toute ou pentoute comme ça c est clair t es d un bord ou t es de l autre so viens pas brailler assume toi calisse right from magog Québec ❤
Its almost like you were required to  say "level up" 15x in that ad
It's chedda and!!!!!!!
Love this
I can't understand it so it must be aliens, just like with the pyramids
Your essays age so well it’s scary mate
Fish n chips
Respectably disagree, the U.S. did not get caught off guard by china’s hypersonic weapons… the game being played here is semantics at the highest level.
I don't understand why Taiwan is so afraid of China, when China says they don't exist 😂
wow i learned alot today..
I am not even half way through the video and I have had to skip ads 3 times wtf
Silicon...i have a piece market. My dog has an under skin id chip
Microchips and semiconductors are not the same thing
Make no mistake about it.  If china was to attempt to invade Taiwan the United States would respond with a declaration of war and a nuclear strike in no time at all .   TSMC is asset number 1 to the united states and our allies.  No joke
Here in 2025  you're 10000000000000% right
We’re fried
Won’t much longer ai and chip will change it all
Happen exactly now, I believe USA can’t control is otherwise it burn down Taiwan independent
Its a faux war - America and China are both controlled by the int money out of thin air cabalists.....      You are being gamed into their great reset.....
Holy shit, you're a genius, to be able to explain history and historical concepts that I never knew about. Thank you and keep up your brilliant work. Very well done !!!
Isn’t skaler just online university but for software??? Same thing as those big institutions
Do an update on this
Bosch is opening a semiconductor factory is northern California, theyre bought out a smaller company and theyre spending 2billion to remodel the plant. Its supposed to be up and running in 2026
Could you do an update video on this subject?  How much has changed/intensified in the last few years?
Why does this feel like Trump's 2025 strategy.
all your videos from 2 years ago are all coming to fruition now. incredible how you’ve predicted all this
Don't forget to translate this videos to Spanish. We need to listen does information to. To more informative and understand the decision that USA take
❤
Dubla esse pra português...
Whoever edits and animates your videos deserves recognition
johny is on acid again, or the CIA said come back, make some more propaganda for us, not bad for a weirdo from salt lake city, mate kolan koala says "why does johny wear a tea cosy on his head"
This was amazing! Your broke this down vey intelligently
They don''t explained it like this on official TV news channel
You do know Nancy pelosi is an insider trader right
Thanks!
Humans
I think Nvidia is doing okay despite the chip act
Remember when nvdia was just “this one chipmaker”
Johnny Harris, I like your videos but the background music is anything as fuck.
Even the camera lens is some form of silica based glass
This video needs a part 2 ASAP.
12:00 What’s the name of this song? Does anybody know? I’ve tried sound hound, Shazam, hell I even tried Deep Seak! PLEASE HELP
12:00 WHATS THE NAME OF THIS SONG PLEASE SOMEONE HELP
JOHNNY HARRIS PLEASE! Can you help me find this song? It’s been bugging me for months!!! 12:00
Joe Biden didnt do anything.. his handler did maybe but  not him
Unfortunately, the very same thing that is making us protect them  is the very same thing that is making them  a huge target...
왕이 바이든으로  전세계다니면서 모두 리턴시켰지.
You should have added a few comments on the Danish company that sells the machines  to Taiwan to make the semiconductors
5:45 that's not exactly how it works...
Amazing job ,explaining the whole thing .... including from geopolitics point of view. great video.great team making this video possible .... thanks guy's.
What about Russia where do they get their chips..i know America is not giving it to them..
Why he calls all Semiconductors Silicon? And it's Silicium, like Germanium, Gallium etc...
👍👌🌅🌎🌹✝️
Thank God someone woke up !
Business the American way. Gotta love unchecked capitalism.

Good one 😂 14:47
I was reading chip war and came here for context. Fantastic explanation👏👏  Love your work♥️
Is it just me or Johny Harris looks like Buck from Far Cry 3 lol. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
TLDR: CHINA IS GONNA TAKE THE US'S CHIPS BY TAKING OVER TAIWAN.  Jk if they take over Taiwan they'll literally just stop making the chips, so they probably won't do that.
Jhonny harris is an amazing researcher!❤
More about china ev bro
heavily biased towards west propaganda as expected but good video
I have to hand it to you, this video was incredibly well made.
This is a really awesome video. As a tech enthusiast, I’ve been engrossed the entire 30+ minutes.
Countries that can design and produce chips will control the world. Nations like Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, the USA, and Malaysia, with their strong foundations in the chip industry, have a significant advantage.
I would like to give you some corrections.  Cutting-edge chips are literally never employed in cutting-edge weapons at all. They are dedicated chips, with low sensitivity of cost. The military has already forbidden the purchase of any US commercial chips for security reasons very early.  Sanctions are a double-edged sword, which implies that they might harm some technologically and economically colonized countries. However, when you attempt to harm sovereign countries, they will harm you even more.  By the way, Taiwan is by no means a country. Even the US government dares not admit it. Chinese people have no intention of going to war with Taiwan. It's not because we are concerned that the US will get involved. On the contrary, the US lacks the courage to do so. Trust me, the US even has no backbone to get involved in the Ukraine conflict. Simply because Taiwanese are like family in our hearts.  I worked for US IT sector companies for over 15 years. I know how they collapsed from monopolies to others now. It is not caused by the effects of sanctions but simply by technological upgrading and the rise of domestic brands.  But I would like to thank you for making this great and interesting video all the same. You should listen to more voices from different side if you are willing to make this kind of research in the future.  Wish there would be no war but only peace and love.
I love the fact that this video highlights the intricacies of global free trade without taking a side. Being pro or against global free trade is an impossible stance to take - its just not that simple!
Such a great video!!
make a part 2.... current chipswar
Harris's usual standard of objectivity and deep sense easily outmatches the mainline channels.   Those could learn hugely from this young man's zest for the truth and discovering the underpinning wisdoms that should be uppermost in the minds of the major actors. But bearing in mind the nature of his brand new POTUS-to-be, I fear absolutely that he forms a miniature island of excellence in a US universe of lies, super-lies and ultra-lies, all formed to justify the worst of practices..  I've been watching the world closely for sixty-plus years and right now I feel less safe than ever has been the case in times gone by.  I'm truly glad that I'm old and on balance am unlikely to experience the obscenities being considered by manic brains in all too many locations.   All are stupid beyond belief since they don't count the possibility of friendship being mutually beneficial to all.  They always have to grab the other guy's land, language, power.  Humanity is a very deeply flawed species - having failed to evolve outside caveman-think tunnel-vision desires to kill, tear, obliterate those he sees not as allies by as enemies and potential enemies.  We learned nothing from two world wars that were the most dire conflicts in the planet's history.  And WW3 is, we're told by many sources, a very real possibility.   We don't deserve to survive, that's the essence of it.  H.Sapiens - "wise man" - what a laugh that is....
This is my favorite jonny video. So incredible and interesting.
Why would we want to sell the enemy our most advanced chips??
Biden sucks.
Great video with one big shortcoming. The role of one of the most important companies in the world: ASML in the Netherlands. The only company in the world capable of making the most advanced machines for chip manufacturing. The tension between China and the US has gotten so far that ASML has become a geopolitical issue. I consider the fact that this is not mentioned in the video to be its biggest shortcoming.
Jesus loves you repent he is coming back he died for your sins please ❤😊o
As a Microchip, I am totally in awe. Everything you said about me is correct and you added some of the things I didn’t even know about myself! Mindblwoing
China will have to find the way to stop the chips of Thaiwan into America. Middle East Nations are going to stop drilling crude oil and stop exporting into western Nations.
Micro Chip Boycot on America is about to occur. The eastern powerful Nations are going stop exporting all kinds of materials to America. The eastern Nations are sending troops into Iran and labenon to balance the east and west power.
Uh oh! Samsung chips got leaked to china. Imagine that
They make "chip" in Chinese secret bunkers, which rail lines go 154 stories beneath the Earth. Advanced Chips. Off market chips. Your chips are decades behind, just saying.
i like the way he presents things, but he has to post videos almost everyday to run his business, so he does not have time to do the homework. the real bottleneck is ASML with their machine, china's SMIC already knows how to make ships. they are made in Holland, but have American made parts. so the US is forcing them not to sell. this lithography machines are the most advanced thing the human race have ever made. they need laser from us, mirrors from Germany. china would take a decade, investing like the lunar program, to make a machine like that.  this move by the US has nothing to do with national security, small amounts of top of the line chips for the military is impossible to prevent, the US built the SR 71 with soviet titanium. not having the chips means worse cars, microwaves, refrigerators, solar panels. cellphones, laptop computers, AI, it is an economic measure.  And the strongest a country could do to another. Sun Tzu wrote in the art of war, “Do not press a desperate foe too hard.” china does not want Cold War, they do not want anybody to take sides. they want to make business with everybody. The US is forcing the world to pick sides
😊
It's the USA blocking them because of how far Infront china, but USA can't ever catch back up, china don't even care about fighting until this insecurity comes out
Can you do the bible how real it is
@17:49 No sir NOT simply"...a crazy UV laser..."! Dutch ASML makes the most cutting edge chip-making machines by far. ASML is, and will be for quite a while, the "de facto", absolute top fab-fabricator. There is in fact zero competition. They hold the de facto monopoly. Dutch ASML can sell chip-making machines to whoever they want, and those machines are way out of leage for every other competitor. So now again, @29:56 Two powers?👴🤨
Are you a panda hugger? What about Korea???
The Chinese are imperialists, like Xi xing pin. The U.S. should defend theirselves for decades to come.
6:40  😂. That was smooth,  'and' in the sentence with AND gate on the screen at the same time
A wonderful piece! However, few are aware of Sherman Fairchild. He had his brain in all sorts of radical things like cameras warplanes, airlines to name a few. He helped Intel, Texas Instruments and Rice University to get a good start. AND He started Silicon Valley. Fairchild Semiconductor made the revolution get its feet.
Wow one thing that Biden administration did right.but late, they already have the idea
I work for AMAT.  We feeling this war.  Can't sell to China Chinese coworkers who sre not American Cirizen are access-restricted
Yeah this didn't age well
🤯
It's different
Maybe Trump sold China the secrets and or they found it from him which would be easy it’s in his mansion in one of the rooms.
Que ya nos conocemos!!!!! Eeuu si no tienen enemigos se los inventa y .
Eeuu es incapaces de ser competentes contra china en tecnología, pues esta claro que pasa a ser un enemigo mas peligroso que taliban o sadan juseim..... A saber que se inventa para crear conflicto y..... WAR,war war......
Aaaaaaaa!!!! Claro también  esta China! Que en poco tiempo a progresado y ahora representa una competencia tecnología aplastante a eeuu y claro ya de paso.,,.. literalmente es El enemigo!!
thats great and all but what stops a 3rd party country from buying it and reselling it to china?  how would we ever know?
it comes to a surprise for me that you don't know what FABS stands for, it is just referring to IC Fabrication, in short we refer to these facilities as fabs.
Your stuff is really good, love this style of docu-learning
I just love transistors. The greatest simplest creation ever
If Linkin’ Park sang - When the darkness comes by Jeri’s Johnson
Watching this after the Asheville flood that has washed away Black Mountain 👍🏼
man, we are in the best geographic position to make chips for silicon valley, Its crazy that we don't. It is also crazy we don't export our natural gas too. There are so many high skill Canadians in America that we could attract back with investments like these.
I simply just started disliking all videos made with ads in them. Like buddy I’m paying YouTube red to avoid this nonsense 💋
Luck had nothing to do with it.  It was little green Men 🫵🤪
I loved this video! Amazing! Thank you
My goodness man, is it just impossible for you to *not* so openly advertise your bias? I'm not some free market purist diehard but I have the impartiality to recognize that Reagan didn't "abandon his principles" via the aforementioned measures against Japan. Protecting national interests does not require abandoning free market principles as you suggest.  You come off as so ignorant when you say crap like this.
NVIDIA brought me here!
But huawei almost beating iphone in terms of sale and in feature techs
Those U.S companies selling out should be shut down, many people jailed.
US will never let any other country better than them , because they are the boss💀
I work at Samsung Electro-Mechanics. Thank you for making me feel a little bit less depressed working in the chip industry.
Johnny, you're an incredible journalist, YouTuber and storyteller!! Wonderful stuff!!
We're selling our greatest tech to our greatest rival.... What could possibly go wrong? Oops 😬
fascinating video.. thanks for making it..
The little snip of “The Big Short” hit hard
Whats the point of making it smaller? It's already small, just use space for another cpu
Dude….. just found your channel…… great work!! If you haven’t you need to do a doc about how folks in the industry are freaked out about the sand crisis…… we are going to run out sooner than later. Read up on it.
… and after a year it is no surprise who will or would win.
One acronym and one name. ASML and Zeiss
take this video into consideration and all its contex on the global stage if ur thinking about Voting for Kamala...think of her running our country making the biggest decisions in the history of this country. cant happen...it just cant be her. absolutely zero qualifications.
All information that is invented from the US should be classified national security and protected soother entities cannot receive it without authorization we allow foreigners to steal valuable information stolen starting from our universities
God Bless you Senator Romney. I just learned that Trump was doing his tantrum thing in your favor against the electoral college in 2012 when it looked like you had the popular vote. It makes me think about how hard it must have been for you to be the lone republican who stood by his values and voted for trumps impeachment. So much love and respect for you. #integrity #morality
美國把敵人當好朋友相信產覺拿頭中搾自己的腳，幾十年錯誤只承認一個中國政策，讓中國霸凌全世界，毫無防備的結果.共產黨的人海戰術可以接收全世界能源，食物，土地跟全世界海域，別忘了台灣最大黨共產黨就是國民黨，美國這些日子完全在做是自殘，為虎作倀.尤其是美國這些大科技公司 Boeing intel ,tsmc 中國共產黨認為是屬于中國公司，Microsoft work for china communist party even part of google Facebook tesla  full of took over by china communist is becoming disasters national security even NASA sold out technology .that how usa politicians  congressman hos corruption sold out country  to china world very soon take over by chinese communist especially those African country allance with chinese communist party aldo United Nations some  corruption organization branch full failed about global humans right especially 器官移植 活災器官，制造 全球 global Covid 19 entirely world depopulation genosidey plan but united nations ICC Court are very weakness dont nothing about it
I love your videos, thanks so much.
ASML deserved a little more time. They aren't at risk from China but the USA does everything it can to keep ASML and the Netherlands happy. If ASML started selling to China, it would solve a third of the problem of setting up the fab.
5:32 that's a vacuum tube!
Netherlands is forced by the US to change regulations and forbid to sell anything to China. We're an American outpost in the EU and everyone knows it.
this entire time history was being made as we watched tiktok and ate tidepods
good video.
It will be practically impossible for china not to acquire chips from the US companies, it's too late for regulations, they're in on it more than we can ever imagine... that's another 50$ billion wasted in chips act
Technically china allowed Taiwan to develop his chip industry
The new leader will be those who invent first accurate quantum computer
Bro is The Goat of Documentaries🙌🏽
Capitalism is so stupid that Taiwan is selling chips to China so China can build its military and invade
hi nick
Now imagine houses in the years before the 80's that had little silicon - maybe the transistors in a radio. In the 80's I served on a warship that used TTL, but had no microchips. Lots of tiny wires in the backplane, cards with discrete transistors, capacitors, and other large devices.
16:30"And this is way we hv nice things" 😂
American greed crushing itself. What a surprise....
Thanks!
united states propaganda
In Spanish please! 😢
8:45 my goodness bill gates has a strong leap
kinda love this guy utils he called Taiwan as a country... It's not committed by the UN. Mind your words, plz.
I guess we know what biden son was doing
When it comes to Russia and china, you look slightly biased. But I understand.
To maintain our military supremacy?!
Honestly I am not able to digest that covid was a couple of years ago   I am still stuck in 2020 lol😂
lol so basically we sacrificed national security for more profit
Yeah..lol...good luck, China! .. wait, what??!
So what! They're making the technology in China? I don't understand US meddling in Taiwan because of chips? I wish it was a stronger resion
Great video.
I live in the Netherlands 🇳🇱 we are so screwed sitting between the two united states and the CCP
Still can't get over the U.S. government being that naive thinking China wasn't going to use the chips to create new weapons.  One thing you might not be aware of is China has been sending its people into U.S. companies (mostly engineers) to learn everything they can about semiconductors.. then they quit & go back to China. I'm quite sure they have everything they need to open up their own plants around their country. I've heard of a few people doing this within the company I work for.  I know they were trying to sue one of them for stealing patented information & designs, just not sure if they got anywhere with it.
Can we send this to Donald Trump?
Now imagine if we can get our asses on mostly solar, destroy our dependency on foreign oil!
you are doing an incredible job. A much helping video for students.
Where is India in this field 😢
Reagan didn't have any principles to start with. Besides greed and corruption.
ISN'T THERE ENOUGH PROBLEM FOR THE WORLD ? PROTECT...? PROTECT WHO ? NOBODY THREATENING  ...AMERICA...ONLY AMERICA  THREATENING  OTHERS ! WE NEED TO PROTECT THE WORLD..FROM THE HANDS OF OF POLITICAL  ELITES..SET ON WORLD DOMINATION AND DESTRUCTIONS !   THERE ARE PEOPLE  IN WASHINGTON WHO BELIEVE..BILLIONS MUST DIE...SO THAT THEY CAN MAINTAIN THEIR HOLD ON POWER...AND RESTART A NEW WORLD ORDER WRITTEN BY THEM....
Bro your videos are very informative and I love all that you do ✊🏾✊🏾
I love the videos but YouTube ads makes them almost unwatchable...
You talk about Taiwan  being a microchip producer but ......What about Korea & japan ?. The" US chip industry is helping China to make better chip technology "  china is getting ahead technologically thanks to US nicrochips ...... what about the black market ?  Some one will sell them chips  if  the US  dont  ... The valuble technology of chips  ...... dont you think there is a networking of the orientals ?  They are genetically different &  ASIANS ! 😅
I’ve watched several videos on this subject but this is just amazing. Could watch over and over.
thanks again!  this is the best educational vidya
Great work ❤❤❤
US continues to make the same mistakes over and over again. Move key components of our lifestyle to another country and then, that country becomes part of another country and we are in trouble or we simply rely too much in other country, instead of relying on ourselves.
Excellent video!! Greetings from Brazil!
"...a geopolitical bargain chip..."😂😂😂
So how long until Chinese industry and companies have total in house production of their own extreme UV lithography IC fabs and complete tool chains able to do sub 100nm feature level IC's which require extreme UV lithography. ? The extreme UV chip lithography fabrication process tech is pretty complex but the fact that it can be done means that it can be re-invented by Chinese industry if the incentive is there. It's been reported that Huawei is at parity with TSMC with their latest mobile chips so the US sanctions effort seem to have have already led to the Chinese building their own industry up and now all the sanctions are doing is harming US consumers and enriching the us military industrial complex. If the US are going to build up their local fabs then Taiwan is going to loose US business and will develop ever closer relations with China which is becoming an ever bigger trade partner.
I’m getting Bill Wertz energy from this video
ears cold or hair greasy?
I am honestly afraid of our future, as someone studying computer science what does this mean for our job market ?
2nm is a commercial name that doesn't have much to do with actual nanometers. The actual distance between transistors (gate pitch) in the 2nm process is expected to be 45nm.
i love your videos!!
Then how malaysia won this microchip war?
I don’t know how I feel about all this. Like yes, it is scary that China has all of these new weapons and it is a bit frustrating that like Russia, China seems to be a master at stealing technology that we figured out for them. They didn’t have to put in the money or the effort, and yet they reap the benefit. (I still wonder if the fact that we have an innovation machine churning here in the West still isn’t one of our truly largest assets. We still lead. I mean what happens when the person cheating off of your math test doesn’t have access to your work anymore?). Anyway, I too have wanted to believe that globalization and interconnectedness keeps us safe, and to be honest, I still think it does. But it is a fragile system, one that can easily break if too many parties start making messes and throwing temper tantrums because they can. It is so much easier to make a mess than it is to clean it up and rebuild. To me, I’m torn because I do feel like the US can’t afford to be so reliant on foreign chips because if China does invade Taiwan, I don’t necessarily want us to get dragged into another conflict, although at the same time, I’d be okay with because I happen to think democracy is the best form of government and I want to protect that. But at the same time, I wouldn’t want to get tangled up in a war with another military superpower with nukes. And if we become less reliant on Taiwan, it feels like that means we are being more populist which feels wrong in a world that we have largely promised to protect. I see America leaning further away from wanting to police the world and provide security for global trade. And it scares me to be honest. To me if we start undoing a lot of our alliances and defense agreements etc, it’ll create a pre world war climate where everyone reacts out of fear and begins stockpiling weapons and nukes trying to prevent more aggressive nations from invading them or taking advantage of them. It feels like a step in the wrong direction. It feels like we’re just reacting to things because that’s what the public wants and that’s what governments want. It is scary. I can feel the fear and the anxiety in myself quite potently. But sometimes I wonder that if China had unveiled that kind of weapon, the one that hopefully they’d never use but is still psychologically terrifying, and we had not retaliated or done anything at all, then maybe the tension would be a bit lower. And we could have quietly tried to do better at containing our technology or stepped up the development of our own hypersonic sub orbital nukes or whatever. Honestly, I’m not sure… it feels like China stole this tech rather than invented it. Would they really get ahead of where we are when they’re just copying our work? Would those weapons matter in the grand scheme of things? Does China really want to get into a hot war with the US? I’m not saying we should take China seriously, I’m just wondering if there’s a way of playing this game without it being so anxiety provoking and fear-based. Can’t we find a competitive game that isn’t potentially world-ending? I’ll take a Cold War over a hot one any day, but cold wars are still just so expensive and costly to our collective mental health. And it’s all being caused by forces outside any one person’s control (unless you’re a totalitarian in which case you actually can control it).
i ate a whole bag of chips while watching this 😂
I just dont get why Taiwan is allowing the us to start making their chips, I mean the only reason the us would have to be unable to make their chips in Taiwan is if either they are no longer friendly or China is involved and both cases are solved if Taiwan makes them themselves. I mean it just looks like the us is trying to make sure they dont have to save Taiwan in a war with China and Taiwan is helping them...
Super interesting video!
As long as the us has ufo technology it's nothing they can't do or make.
This man caps and spreads propaganda at times
I work for ADI and worked for TSMC in the past, and this video PERFECTLY explains this industry and its impact on the world. Amazing job, hats off to you guys
America initially stole gun powder and warships from China so shouldn’t be an issue if China did the same
I don't like biden, but that was pretty smart good for him
John several points that you make in this video is not accurate. I would explain here but it's late where I am right now and this really isn't the venue. Reach out and I'll share what I know. Be well, the videos are fun.
Where do you find all this info
Just watched 3 of your videos and have learnt more about the world than 5 years of high school education. A+ Content
TSMC is probably the most important company in the world and that's not an exaggeration at all.
ASML has a much bigger influence on the chip industry than there is mentioned in this video.....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSVHp6CAyQ8  You also forgot to mention that the USA made a deal with ASML to get 50% of there chips instead of going to China! Don't leave very very important parts out of your video....
Vladimir putin cutting off gas to Europe?! USA blowed up ns2 you hipster
I think you should also look at rare earth elements. This is relevant to this story as you need REE to make these chips and emerging “green” technology. China actually holds the raw materials to make these products.
All the fabs that were supposed to be built in America because of the chips act have been delayed although they are building in other countries lol.
Try to be more objective next time, why it's always military when it comes to China? Did US banned Japanese chips for the same reason? In fact it is US who have colonized the entire world, please don't act as a victim to foreign military threats.
Hi Nick
I thought you where going to break them gadgets to show us them silicons 😅🎉
America worst enemy is, Greed
Did China school us at the game of military/industrial complex?
Weird trying to connect that guy who invested into taiwans semi conductor chip company into saying it’s now a state owned company.
So Black Ops 2 was prophetic, kinda.
I went from "what's the big deal about these chips" to "OMG,  I see"! Great video: knowledge and delivery. Good stuff!
I love Taiwan even more now!
The KMT government started semi conduct production strategy back in 1980's, a time when US and China had a very cozy relationship, so to say taiwan developed semiconductor manufacturing because it wanted to have US protection is false.  Over the years the US has forced taiwan to build factories in the US, nd the Taiwanese company complied with US demand but these factories always failed to make profit because the US lacked qualified and willing workers.   Since Obama's pivotal to Asia  Taiwan faced massive pressure to move its most advanced production to the US because of "national security" concerns, and 2 thousand senior engineers was loaded onto planes and shipped to the US.  It is understood that the US instructed Taiwan to destroy the factories should China ever invade.  so it is ludicrous to argue taiwan uses semiconductor to guarantee US involvement. it is more logical to think Taiwan is being used as a proxy against China, much like Ukraine against Russia.
Did this guy really compare chips to China and gas to Europe 😂 yeah bro let me just go cook my food on my laptop
Just creating those missiles should be a war crime… wtf is the UN going to do about that, why are they allowing these militaries to invent weapons that make it easier and easier the destroy civilizations at such a fast rate. Do we not care about our own survival
Lol and the virus was a computer generated image based on an image of a bacteriophage which is much larger... What a smarty... :P
yeah china sell potato chips
More than 180 countries have established diplomatic relations with China. At the same time, they promised that there is only one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory, and the Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government representing the whole of China.  The United States does not want to see a prosperous and strong China surpass it, so it has used all means to suppress China. But it's okay, it's only a matter of time before China fully masters Stepper technology, just like our space station.
I say we don’t sell china any chips
In the Netherlands people say:   We don’t need NATO, we have ASML (The chip company)
So few understand what's really behind current conflicts
This Video is wrong actually because the US is not the most important country in global semiconductors supply chain. Many country are capable of semiconductor design including China it is getting it made that's actually harder and the hardest part is developing the euv machine that ASML makes, the lithography machine made by ASML are the most important because without ir nothing gets made. All the design and fabs in the world are useless without the euv machine.
Hi Thx for the good video. Simple question  - why do wear a hat at home while recording 😀
This all tells that's there is only one chess player that do all this .. and what he wants is WAR..
F-35,F-16,M1 abrams, genocide,conflicts,now these are main U.S MICROCHIPS
Mr Johnny Harris,  I tip my hat to you. I am 73 years old and recently retired. I have been a musician, a song -writer, a  pilot,  a pastor and I have headed up an innovation centre at a university and been a high school teacher  - but I  have learned more from you than I have learned from a lifetime of formal education. You are the most  gifted teacher I have ever witnessed and had the privilege  to learn from. Keep up the good work. The people of the world have much to learn and you are the best person to teach it!
I saw the Arizona TSMC fab under construction while on a road trip and it is mind bending just how huge it is.
These videos are so good 😆
Man is playing god, only a few more steps before creating life itself.
Cia agent, I can smell it
Tiny piece of silicon
It's my first time watching him, and I'd say he's such a talented orator. Good narration
I did recall reading a news article within the past year about TSMC.  They have many of their factories along the western shore of Taiwan, likely to prevent the PRC from cracking the value "eggs".
Why do you think China can't do it all by itself...the design and production...they have best engineers, cheap labour and a huge manufacturing sector...I don't understand why dont they think about designing it themselves...if they have engineers who can design and build a misile technology that even US is still trying hard to build, why cant a chip that has been here in the market for a very long time...
I know this video was made at least a year ago and now all the Chinese coming across our southern border makes sense. Can you speak on this?
A new war who make the operating quantum computers
Which country have more engineers and more researchers ? Which country have more technological companies ?
i just love how through out the video Johnny reaches at a conculsion and then quickly negate it--- i dont know its just so fun to watch---- also this is like my 5th time watching this video
23:45 bidin'
There's a great book about this called Chip Wars
I love this video.  It opened my eyes.
This is an informative video that is beautifully presented. Congratulations. However there are a few points where you were either misleading or intentionally misinforming us.  At 14:12 point, you said Taiwan needed to be able to defend themselves against their "big aggressive neighbour". Wait, at what point did China become an aggressive nation? At what point in their five thousand year history that instead of trading, they conquered and colonised far away lands like South East Asia? Do they have military bases installed around the world? What country has they ever invaded or sent military to? How do you define aggressive so that the word now only applies to China but the same adjective is never used in the other countries you mentioned in your video like the one that demolished and devastated entire civilisations like Indonesia?  At 30:20 point, you said Russia is using their oil as a weapon and threatened to cut off supplies to Europe. This is objectively false and easily disproved. They continued to supply oil and gas to Europe from their various pipelines until the applied economic sanctions from Europe (that is illegal and not recognised by the United Nations) made oil and gas supply almost impossible due to broken contract terms e.g. currency and broken turbines that remained unrepaired under the contractual framework left after the sanctions. As a journalist, surely have also searched and reported how Russia has continued even to this day to supply oil and gas to Europe (at a volume of 21.3 bcm!) through remaining pipelines, one of those goes through Ukraine (the Druzhba pipeline)!. The Russians are still paying Ukraine today for the transit fees to supply oil and gas to Europe, even when the employees are put under massive stress and difficulty because they still respect their responsibility to fulfil their supply contract to Europe. Even after the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines (not by Russia [The Economist][New York Times][Washington Post]), the Russians continue to try to supply oil and gas to Europe. So how can you say that Russia "wants to cut off supply to Europe to be spiteful" when every day ordinary Russians strive to fulfil their duty and obligations to Europe? When it is obvious third-parties (USA? Norway?) are the ones that destroyed Nord Stream and caused one of the most significant greenhouse gas release to this date? Remember methane is 28 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas - forget that net-zero carbon target.  But do you want to know who, on the other hand, wants to cut off oil and gas supply to Europe? You're the journalist. So I should not have to paste these here.  https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/11/energy/ukraine-russia-gas-suspension/index.html https://www.wsj.com/articles/natural-gas-prices-rise-in-europe-after-ukraine-cuts-flows-11652255011 https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/11/natural-gas-prices-in-europe-jump-after-ukraine-blocks-russian-flows.html  Those articles would have perfectly supported the point you were making - that economic interdependence is being used as a weapon. But bewilderingly, you did not cite them, but instead chose to cite misinformation that is objectively false.
This is why you should never depend on anyone we should be at top of everything from Doritos to microchips
Sorry to say, I find your video is reporting on the subject with the same underlying american supremacy assumption. Why not putting things in context and indeed pointing to the obvious, which is that it is just all about business. America does what it that for business and China does what it does for business. It is very apparent to me that one operates through wars and intimidation and the other through logic and diplomacy. State the fact please. How many wars has the american empire been in during its rise? Too many to count. How many wars has China been (so far) during its rise? Zero.
well you could say a virus is not alive but it reproduces... if a virus was not life,why would it try to survive? in my eyes the basic of life,is preservation of it.... and it tries to preserver it existance. a virus is like a parasite,only at cell level. like your cecum,it not there for nothing,its actually there as a home for a virus. (i know cause i have it) but this virus is like cancer,it can be good or bad. some people live with this virus,but lets say god,(since i know you where a believer ). in some people this virus causes trouble and you need to remove you cecum. but in other people is more symbioses...and the virus just lives in your intestines. its how the virus acts in your body.... i wanna give you a blessing,thank the lord god,you opened you eyes,and that church is not the only way. sometimes the light of god blinds people,and not make them see truth. church is not the whole truth. love your videos..... what created the big bang,and who created what? god created the universe...even if he does not intervene. bless you... you shine like sunlight itself......god loves you.
There are channels on youtube that if you don't watch, you are a horrible ignorant.
Excellent informative video
This was the most compelling video I've seen of yours yet.
This dude is solid with his knowledge 👏
You nailed the episode sir ! I watched the entire thing without a single pause and absorbed a wealth of knowledge and information from your videos. Thank you, sir.
Paranoid😂😂😂
China will not invade Taiwan. It will take time, but the time and the situation will come when Taiwan voluntarily joins China. The USA will be surprised, but even before this step, China will come to an agreement and build friendly relations with Japan. Sooner or later, the USA will realize that it will not go far with its overdeveloped weapons arsenal if most of the world voluntarily sides with China, because it sees that it can better promote its own interests and its own development. The USA was the great hope of the world after 1945, but today it has become an aggressive, selfish szuper-power, and fewer and fewer countries like it. You can be the strongest in a pub, but you can only win a fight if you don't start a fight with everyone.  Too much power sooner or later falls back on your head
I am very sure that DJI stole the tech from the GoPro Karma drone so it flopped
China designs cutting edge chips too. Like Huawei   now they are banned in the tame so they can’t make them any,ore. They are not just consumers
China will not defeat the USA militarily, not in a war. The majority of the world's countries will sooner or later rather stand on China's side, they will seek cooperation with it. The world is getting fed up with the unbridled aggressiveness of the USA,  forever and always putting its own interests above everything else.
Good piece except oatmeal brains. Didn’t go after china. Trump did. Please be real and not push your hate
Hey man, I like your videos! Just one thing though, the tariffs imposed by Reagan on Japanese products in 1987 only lasted for about a year and I quote “did nothing to curb American’s appetites for such products”. The Bush Sr admin removed all of the tariffs by 1991.   "U.S. firms prospered because of their ability to innovate and compete effectively, not because of such techno-nationalist or protectionist measures," says James L. Schoff, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace
😢我的天啊 這是我第一次看到，能從頭到尾完整講完晶片故事的人。 比那些被中國機器人假故事洗腦的人，你比他們好10倍。 願神祝福你 來自台灣的祝福❤  順帶一提，中國人他們透過很多方式 在海外大量取得晶片 例如，像4090電腦顯示卡 他們透過海外收購新卡或是二手卡，把所有外殼都拆光，再用郵寄的方式，把電路基版寄回中國。
I just discovered this guy, absolutely LOOOOOOOVE his videos wow theyre so educational and touch on global topics that are insanely interesting
Im just bingeing all these valuable informative videos Thankyou!
I actually deliver to a tsmc site here in Arizona. My company does business with them. By far one of the biggest job sites I’ve ever seen. Also competes with our intel fab52.
There is two heroes  in our world  who guide us to the truth druv rathee and jhonny harris.
Motorola had fabs all over the world listed on back of old data books location.  Guys, google then microphone  when listen comes out ask for chip location on part number or ask who has chip style resistor networks for example.  Or who has ASIC comprable to Atmel. Gate, clocks etc.  You must scroll move screen to find available dealer.  Motorola said call/us for funny LH000CH it was my first part. My second was a power supply for Schindler Elevator sold but wrong part. He said young lady I may have to stop all my production.  Everyone laughed at me and I didn't get it.  I felt so bad.  The whole office worked with me to fix this huge problem.  CAM/RPC
You can find replacement chips in old products ...pick the boards
You need to search on global positioning systemms GPS to find out the truth about TSMC being destroyed in war.*. That may be why silicon chips which were stamped fir different manufacturers are not available.  Atomic chip production is for new technology.  America is  silicon
Too much fluff not enough real news....
Thanks to scaler . I was a basic code writer essentially starting with myspace and now i make 300k a year which is modest. BUT, the people ive networked with have taught me how to make that 300 Tax free baby! 😏😉 Thanks johnny
The war started long ago and it’s picking up as of late.
"Biden rolled up his sleeves. What's the first thing to do?" Stick your nose on a child. Edit: Hilarious. This dude knows he does that, so he made it where I couldn't word it differently because the comment kept disappearing.
cold war II
Most of YouTube's videos about China have a strong political leaning, and people simply don't know what the real facts are. In short, history and rules are written by the winners, and in this war, if China wins, all the arguments will be only one voice, but if China loses, China will not only fall into endless slander, but also have no chance to turn over
2:24
Japan’s failure at chips wasn’t simply down to ‘Evil Reagan’ as you try and show. It was a complex issue, and also Japan’s fault. This is an example of your own political bias obscuring the truth, which is nuanced and not as black and white as you wish.
Biden let China balloon spy in low flight wrt satellites to get detailed scans of the most sensitive military & nuclear sites. Biden a got $millions from china. Biden is essentially a paid Chinese agent
Reagan didn’t abandon principles for chips. Even Adam Smith in the “invisible hand” says nations should protect vital industries at home with tariffs. In England he used the example of shipyards
Why are 2 most powerful countries fighting over chips ? Come to uk we will give you fish and chips
The Chinese are producing their own microprocessors from their own designs. While not as powerful as the AMD/Intel/ARM processors they will get there.
A microchip is not really like a brain at all except that it is structured like a network.  The microchip is a series of logic stages synchronized by a clock.  You can chain logic gates (ands, ors, nots) to make more complicated things like adders and subtractors.  Really a computer is designed to do a series of things in a sequence to perform a more complicated task.
Are you sure they're not called micro crackers?
Now who didn't see that coming
Leave The World Behind
I guess the ending of this was military war, correct me if I'm right?
USA really fcks up everything because of greed.
Just subscribed informative and interesting videos
If China accounts for 40% of chip sales doesn’t that make TSMC dependent on China for revenue? Not to mention increased competition as China is scrambling to create their own Chips even though they’re currently inferior they’re likely more than enough to power basic appliances that aren’t as integral as weapons development or smart devices like phones & computers? China’s allies don’t owe Taiwan or the US any favours so isn’t that just starting global economic factions in technology? China makes everything much cheaper than anyone else can even imagine. I guarantee no one will be selling cheaper  chips than China.
TSMC: “Taiwanese Semiconductors by Morris Chang”
In the PHILIPPINES we have Kakong CHIPS dominating the whole nation making life people's better
Intel was stuck on 14nm FOREVER, until they started getting help from TSMC. The joke was Intel's new "14nm++++++ fab", adding a "+" with each generation until they finally got off of 14nm after 5 or 6 generations of CPUs.
Wow it was super interesting the content was excellent and how you conveyed it was excellent. Thank you Johnny Harris.
Reagan should have funded the chip industry. We wouldn't be in this position now.
So....GREED, again, causes problems....
And you still got companies trying to skirt regulations and endanger our country for a buck... Nvidia
Awesome job with this video! Thanks for sharing.
You say it runs our world and we don't need any of it for any reason at all just like the days before it got here we didn't have it then and we didn't need it at all
There's a big mix-up about those advanced chips we talked about around 21:36 in the video. Turns out, missiles and military stuff aren't really using those super-fancy 7nm chips that the U.S. banned. It's actually our everyday gadgets like phones and electric cars that are big on them. These chips are more about powering the cool tech we use all the time, not so much for military gear.  And another thing, about those military drills mentioned at 28:56. They did happen in six areas set by China and lasted a few days. But, guess what? They didn't stop the shipping boats from doing their thing around Taiwan. So, despite some serious vibes in the region, it looks like business as usual for trade in those waters.  Basically, the U.S. blocking chips, hitting Huawei and other tech giants with sanctions, and not letting Chinese stuff like electric cars be sold in the States is really about slowing down China's growth. It's not just a jab at CCP, but it also messes with everyday Chinese folks trying to get better life. Taking a stand against 1.4 billion people? Not the smartest move.
Great video johnny!
As a Chinese, I do not worry about the Chip War between US and China, but about the so far unemerged tech in the future. USA is far more advanced in basic science and that is the area brewing new technology. While I am optimistic in China's future as our goal is not to beat USA, but keep improving the live standard of ourselves, that means China will also put great effort in R&D.
😂There is no war in the trade of microchips. No one will be killed. No blood will be shed. No buildings will be  destroyed.  China has her own Customers. The US has her own customers. They never need to worry as long as they can buy their devices     Harris Ng YM AMEN 🍰🎵🌲☕
23:15 "Joe Biden rolls  down his sleeves and" ... forgets what he wanted to say... 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yet... theirs the biggy
Johnny, your understanding of the Chinese/ Taiwan relationship is primitive, unnuanced, and uneducated. Not surprising, you as an American only see Taiwan as a chipmaker critical to maintaining global hegemony, Chinese see Taiwan as family. I would level up on your understanding of geopolitics in the region. Maybe scaler can help.
China and U.S. vs the super computer that can take control of the world
BTW, Morris Chang is born in mainland China.
China didn't need to invade Taiwan due to chips. Chips is out of the question here, it's all about "INDEPENDENCE". China will immediately invade Taiwan once Taiwan declares INDEPENDENCE. This is not acceptable to China because Taiwan is her island. China will not let that to happen to let Taiwan to get away with it.  So, once Taiwan declares INDEPENDENCE, that's the end of the road for Taiwan, it will trigger China to invade and occupies Taiwan at all cost. Even if USA send its entire force of 7th and 6th Fleets and its allies to  fight for Taiwan, China will still invade and occupies Taiwan and bring Taiwan back to its fold.
Biden simply advanced upon the int’l policies that Trump put into place. Don’t mislead the public.
Love the video with lots of  informative information.
Yeah....Huawei just won that war...
MATTHEW 13:44 Jesus said " The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field."
I’m so over all the bullshit ads
通篇胡说八道
Been pondering this since i saw a flower grow in the snow we are carbon based can you imagine what a silicon life base would be ?
Brilliant just 👍🏿 and sub 👏🏿.
You got the Jesus hippie look going on I see you Johnny Harris1
Hay Johnny Harris I see you got the long hair now. Hope you had a great Thanksgiving weekend1
Just missed the largest producer of chipmachines of the world but ok (ASML)
Make a latest news update video this videos is 10 month old make complete video about China and USA cold war
Wow
I really like your videos but I HATE YOUR LEEEEEEENGTHY ADS!!!
Today:  Biden: “Our greatest threat to our national security and future is China. We need to reduce our dependence on foreign nations and bring manufacturing back to the United States.”  Left: “Yeah, Go Biden!! Our hero!!”  7 years ago:  Trump: “Our greatest threat to our national security and future is China. We need to reduce our dependence on foreign nations and bring manufacturing back to the United States.”  Left: “Mean orange Xenophobe, China is our friends."   Really like most of your videos, but it is obvious what side of the tracks you are on. No such thing as an independent journalist today.
Microchip disagreements between the US and China will lead to recession and actual war. The sad truth is that innovation is inevitable. Innovation itself causes wars. It is a war between old traditions and loyalties versus new ideas and opportunities. Good is the enemy of better.
Russia has stronger military than China
Damn Semi Conductors ? ? ...
Thanks!
Why doesn't EU  and Russia doesn't start the microship prodution,too? What a lazy people that only want the plants only in China... Shameful West. ..🕳️👋
🤔
There are several huge fabs in Arizona
Your editing is amazing, and thanks for educating me about chips.
Comment just ro help the channel 😊😊
Nvidia is a Japanese company not an American.
Remember the last time this happened is 1957... the moment the soviet union invented the first ICBM and launch its first sattelite sputnik 1
Johnny Harris makes it easy to understand. ❤
Its funny how democrats take credit of protecting chips when its was the republican president ronald reagan really started it. Plus ronald reagan created the silicon valley in california in the 1980's.
I don't understand if US has those so advanced technics why they can't beat China?? the chips the software the internet , the money, the Language, there is so many barriers for Chinese. But still US can't beat China fairly ？  Can US just run faster instead of slowing others down?
yo
As someone on the inside working with this stuff, it's pretty cool how you're able to make the to me seemingly mundane seem really interesting :)
Taiwan is the 52 state just after Canada
China can become good at making chips too - potato chips that is😂
It's gonna be a demons' control to humanity. They used lying and improving technology of controlling humanitarian and their power. They are smarter enough than ordinary people to have like this technological advancement. The president in China and USA can be just a best friends playing a break game in reality that they both owned and developed. To test how it will exactly work. For sure its not just the first time of their tests.
China's military chips have long been self-sufficient. The problem is Consumer chip
Each transistor is smaller than my DNA 😱😭😭😭
looking back at us containment polices on chips, which are no more than jokes.   now they are planning to dump chips and choke the nascent Chinese chip industries. 🤣🤣🤣
The real problem is that US is kind of rotten to the core....   China military is making progress for sure, but look at how many failed military projects the US has failed in 21st century: F35s barely flying, cancelled Zumwalt ship, hypersonic weapons getting nowhere.  And 9 months after this video, where are the fabs being built in US? They are not getting anywhere and TSMC is now saying the most advanced fabs will stay in Taiwan.
If a nuclear war irrupted today because of these chips at about 30 minutes back from me writing this comment and the world perished from the war, I would never have known what killed me.
Say level up more
As the US cuts China off of chips, China can cut off US of materials, such as rare earth minerals, and high quality graphite, etc., since these things are also being used in US military weapon productions.
Just stop all trade, travel, cut the internet and live in peace. #givepeaceachance #usa #china #Europe #russia #sudan #myanmar
Some of your vids are completely wrong.
There are them in South Korea, Japan and the Netherlands. Why didn’t I know?
So the chips should be given to the United States and China? I don’t quite understand??
Bro I fucking love this guys videos
I love working in the semiconductor industry. But most importantly, i love working for TSMC. We are the best in the world at what we do 👏   And yes, Taiwan is beautiful and the people are amazing. I highly recommend visiting if you ever get the chance.
so whos been selling the equipment to china ?
I comment to help statistics
im so glad i dont live in the usa
Yeah I need to find a new night time YouTube channel this guys disrupting my sleep schedule
Thanks for the trade war and tech war. China is more independent and powerful than ever.
My NES is still working, kinda wish FABs stayed in Japan...
I love you I wish to meet you one day to just listen to you talk for hours.
huawei is coming haha
fun fact cars and refrigirators can be build without chips ....... but they are much less energy effective ..... so it works but it works better with chips (as long as no one hacks it or builds a montly fee to work model in it...)
Use and provide random micro chip technology to anywhere to sustain impact you hold
👏👏👏 to blocking all the chip. National security!
why the hell are you sitting in a room wearing a winter hat ?
This is an excellent educational video about chips.   Just to add though-US has over 800 military bases around the world. Guess how many China have? ONE. China are building their military in response to US Hyperpower empire expansion.
rock on Johnny!
If semiconductors are that important to human race today… I think the US should annex Taiwan before the Chinese, since Taiwan is the only place on planet earth that knows how to produce the most advanced chips.   If China needs Taiwan; the US and the world needs Taiwan even more…   ANNEX TAIWAN TODAY!!!
“Cold War vibes are back.” Clutches her pearl necklace.
why is it always the best youtubers that get targeted by scam sponsors
Any update now?
16:14 So you telling me we can implant a 2nm microchip into my DNA or Blood Nervous System.🤔 Together with A.I the world is approaching the Edge of Medical Science
1:40: How many are "Made in China" vs China's Domestic Consumer closed Market offline and online "China's great firewall".Which affects and is closed off towards Western Social Media and Ecommerce transactions...
This man blew my mind 😐
I’m going to illegally steal your content and repost it on IG
WW3 over chips
Thanks for your views!!! !!!!  !!!!!
The world change but only for worst,btw the computer is invented from Bulgarian guy Jhon Atanasov.
sadly this channel seems like it is becoming fake news
And so why do we want to stop China's advancement? Is it a given fact they will reign war upon s when they can, or do we just not like it when someone gets as strong/ stronger than us in some way?
So basically Microchips are like Vibranium today.
Lagta hai chips maang raha hai
You should do a report on how we get chocolate. Something to think about next time you turn to that Reese's cup for comfort..
It’s weird to watch this video now that Huawei is using Chinese 7nm chips made in China… the US really lost it’s edge on this technology
Hey update as for September, China finally getting on 7nm semiconductor on Huawei Phone. The whole reason of keeping Taiwan safe might be gone by now. And the big reason they blocked semiconductor, might be less effective.
Taiwan is NOT  country. Taiwan is a part of China. Taiwan does not have embassies, not do other countries have ambassadors in Taiwan. Taiwan does not have a seat in the UN. The US stopped recognising Taiwan as a country in the 1970s. So how is it a country? How can China invade itself. Can't trust this channel
Man if America is really have Taiwan back they come out and tell the world it going to give full military support Taiwan independent but they do not. And now people see China new Huawei phone with that new chips so US the one need to buy chips for China not Taiwan just see in 2 to 3 year time.
You're not wrong about silicon (chips) being in most modern devices and appliances but that's not really relevant to the point. Those low end chips are not what is being contested. There are a wide variety of companies with the knowledge and capability to manufacture low end chips. No one can or is trying to prevent China from acquiring low end chips. It's the cutting edge, high end chips manufactured with the latest process nodes that are guarded, such as those manufactured by TSMC, Intel, and Samsung. There are a slew of other fabs that manufacture less exciting commodity grade chips and they will continue to manufacture them and circulate them around the globe for use in everything from appliances, to cars, to toys, to medical equipment.
Some one elas out side of planet earth should take control of bit 🪙 coins and buy it out for a different level!
Bit coints?
Change the word 'smart' to 'death' ..as it tranlates to in hebrew..now place that word infront of your meter,phone,car,doorbell etc.💯👍🏻
It’s an prolonged inbalance warfare. Several tenth thousand of young engineers against a few politicians from the congress.
you know, the term "2 nm process" doesn't actually have a feature size of 2 nm. It's more like 20 nm. Still mind-boggling but a quick research on that would've done the job right
Damn!!! This level of quality reporting is on another level. I kind of take your contents as a mini lecture and I even sometimes mistook the ads to the actual subject, sorry 😮 my bad!😅
meanwhile, we recently just lost a plane the same way you lose your keys
To be more precise. The USA chip war against China, not US - China Chips War. Similarly, it is the US invasion and war against Iraq, Not war between US  and Iraq. US invasion and war against Libya, so on and so forth. By saying US - other country war, you are trying to spread the blame and guilt. It is always the USA, who first threatens, then take small military provocations, followed by full scale invasions and mass murders. There's ni invasion and mass murder in this US Chips War against China, nut the principle is still the same. US launched a one-sided attack and also forced its vassal states to follow, just like in their Invasions and mass murders.
There is a missing link here, a lot of chip design is actually British. Not American. Search ARM. The chip designs that are in every smartphone and tablet. Countless military weapons. When you talk about those incredibly small semiconductors, ARM designed chips are the ones leading the way. I think this is a bit of an oversight considering the instruction set for most SoCs in the world is British designed. Specifically in Cambridge
You seem to be doing very well, so I doubt this comment will ever make a difference. Still - to some ppl, like me, you're part of the propaganda machine, not the dissenting independent source that you  profess to be. In this clip, it's obvious from the complete disregard of Trump's efforts in the chip trade war. In another clip, you took Trump's completely sane and on-the-spot comments about C***D19 and presented them as "stoking hate" - like you can read minds and hearts. So - great content, but still serving the machine.
Hi Nick
Great video as always, but you should’ve eaten a chip at the end! 😂
What now? China can make 7nm chips with all indigenous equipment, while USA is still struggling with 10nm, which heaviliy depends on foreign technologies such lithography systems from ASML 😁
Holy Moly. Love your videos <3
Russia has had hypersonic missiles even before china lol
wait a minute the US ban was during Trump administration....
I wonder what chinas favorite chip is. My favorite is doritos
I like your videos but.... India China border in your maps are very wrong..
Imagine how far our civilization would go if we work together
now we have enough tech to made military chips 哈哈
That's why they want Taiwan's micro chip industry
哪个国家的芯片不安装在导弹上，美国吗
华为和军事有什么关系，美国政府是完全用国家安全的借口来打压中国科技公司
Missiles and fighters  normally use 100nm chips, the blockage of China from the most advanced chips is because the US wanted to remain hegemony of the world. Other countries don't have the rights to surpass them in the most leading field, they still thought they are the master and other have to beg to live.
at 17:52 you are missing germany making the lenses for the crazy uv lasers from the Netherlands^^
Sorry,if I am right,the first person brought up the idea is not morris cheng,his name is 曹興誠 ,an singaporean
Oversimplified, dumbed down, and some fairly poor conclusions, but hey-ho, it is not made for us Europeans, its made for Americans.  5% of Americans are the smartest people on the planet, so if you are aiming to grow a channel, that's not who your will aim your content at right?  FYI I am a semiconductor design engineer and I am based in China.
You just opened the freaking door. Wow.
中小规模冲突是有可能的，大规模战争永远不会发生，除非大家都想回到石器时代
Every time he says chips take a drink 🍻 ..... Of juice
It's inconclusive who wins the chip war, unless there's a national plan for producing engineers the caliber of Taiwanese.
Every Chinese American can see it coming from a mile away
What about Intel? Not being represented on the pie chart.
thanks this is very clear and good video right on the spot ... for me the armies of the future are gonna be from fighting robots imagine 10 000 drones against 5 000 tanks ......
US n soviet union was both not trusting each other even though they were allies during ww2. The US might have thinkin the same also on china
chips the new oil.
THANK YOU!!!! I have wanted to know so much of this for YEARS but couldn't ever find anyone who was able to explain how it all works and most importantly, in the (comprehensible) way like you've done for us throughout this video so now a lot of my questions are (at long last) answered!! I feel like a big itch has finally been scratched and it's very satisfying so seriously, thank you!! Lol!!! 👏👏👏👍
That sounds like a Chinese government type thing to do. Kinda like when ultron clowns on humanity using vibranium to make a shield when it’s applications are so much more than that lol. They put this huge amount of effort into creating a faster Nuke, all so the world could be destroyed even faster because it still won’t stop everybody from firing theirs lmao.
Steve Jobs and bill gates didn’t invent the color tv, a Mexican named Guillermo González Camarena who did.
We were good to China they broke peace. It makes since now. Especially how we look at that... We can't trust them.
Nvidia is now worth over $1 Trillion (market value) after destroying earnings expectations in first half of 2023. One of the best performing stocks this year. The new laws only highlight the importance of chips, and don't seem to be slowing down US companies.
Looking forward to the product that will replace chips. No idea what that could be, but it will come.
Huge thanks for what you do guys!
So this is why lots of foreign companies are leaving China!
China will win.
i think the next step in this economic cold war is for all US companies to move factories back to our land or to our neighbor Mexico. we need to not depend on a hostile government for manufacturing American products.
Oh this video is old. Should add in China banned the sale of two rare earth metals to the US. I think they are mostly used in EV batteries but I believe they are used in semiconductors too.
Because of this video, a part of my thesis is on the microchip war.
My dad worked in semiconductors for almost 30 years. His company designed low-power CPUs that were fab'd in Taiwan and sold to China. I once asked him what the chips ended up in, and he said something like "I dunno, maybe cheap computers for people." It now appears likely to me that my father's work is/was powering Chinese military equipment. 🫤
Propaganda.  You really need music every five seconds to fit the native?  Just say you support crony capitalism because your think tank pays you too  Just be honest you don't want a free market so poor people can have jobs you want a free market so corporations can have more influence to lobby congress into passing oppressive policies  Maybe people will still support that either way you shouldn't have to lie to sell your message it's not necessary
Dude scaler is not going to put a person on the front line or the cutting edge, it is basically a data structure algorithms class that one can learn for free on youtube. Just using filler word "cutting-edge", "put you on the front line", "level up" to advertise,. That is why I never believed at what sales people say. Also, using scaler is not going to make you a software engineer. It is just an interview prep course, which also does not mean the person will be ready for interview.
Why you have 20 unskippable ads
Thanks Johnny. Super interesting!!👌💯
soooooooo it is a cold war
USA failed to keep it secret 😔
This week…the escalation moved up with Bidens visit to Japan. Shits getting real.
Too simple and subtil inaccuraces
Real I.T stuff.
Idk... I wouldnt be suprised if all US chips have backdoors they can manipulate somehow... I mean, snowden/wiki leaks kind of proved they can spy on  you and access your devices even while they are powered off and not connected to a network with US chips ... so why would it be any different for US chips in chinese missles... if the US was actually threatened by them, I bet there is some method they could use to disable them in the blink of an eye... china is stupid asf for using their enemies tech.
*CORRECTION* China might have more ships, but they're all small fishing style boats. The US still has more tonnage.
I've been around silver spoons complaining. But this needs a bit of medical treatment. Please keep your thoughts under control. Worried about you buddy! Go outside and try gardening. It is how we, as in everyone on this planet, can live a bit longer.
The computer was inveted by Karl Zuse, a German mastermind!
Update needed since China has now placed a hold on rare minerals needed to make the chips!
Trader Joe’s sells peanut butter cups, but they do not sell Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups.
Just turn these videos into also a podcast! I would absolutely listen - obviously your visuals are so important and amazing, but i occasionally do just listen to what your saying
"and Joe Biden rolls up his sleeves and said 'Alright everyone, where's my sniffin kid? I'm not doin nothin until I get a whiff up both barrels'"
Looks like the tortoise 🐢 beat the hare 🐇 😅😅😅😅
It's so ironic but the people who are protecting us from China are our leaders and they are only doing it not to lose power, the US people have already sold out and continue to buy chinese. The people chose to lose.
didnt you miss the bit where it was democrats who gave away all the tech and were sleepwalking and then it was trump who put the tech embargos in place..
Summary of the book Chip War
so the next jump in computing isnt a transitor. We gotta find a new way to make electronics. A better way.
Palki Wion copied paste your talking points
Very informative 👌👌👌👌👌
The problem is, U.S.A selling chips with china since years ago. It was continous except what happened now? I mean almost all the people in the world knows china is the greatest country when it comes to imitation. I hope it's not too late to cut off selling chips to china.👍🙏
The Gateway to immortality (smaller diameter than a virus) - this is it Johnny, this is how  cardiovascular nanobots that prevent high blood pressure and sugar.  Artificial intelligence inside of us.. protecting us?  But we don't need those things right?  We can find high blood pressure ourselves, I don't know, it can be a hard fight (especially if you like smoking tobacco or eating red meat).  Potassium, hold my breath for a minute, ok, I'll keep doing that.  I'll look at sodium intake again, that's bad too  Everyone wants to live longer Johnny.  Putin wants to be younger, more attractive.  So does Xi.  We all want this!
I'm also something of a silicon user myself.
Im learning so damn much broski thank you 💪
Read China Mirage ...

it's fun that in like the current race two countries could have the ability to like annihilate the entire planet five hundreds times over in nanoseconds one day
Now I understand the plot of Fast and the furious and MI
That guy really makes conservatives melt 😂🤡🤡🤡
We lived half a century without chips. And y think that scares me😂😂😂😂
It is a very wonderful work, which fully explains the cause and effect of chips in complex geopolitics, but I think it is a pity that there is a part that is not objective when it comes to the conflict between China and the United States. In a democratic country, representative politics Constraints may make the government of a democratic country look slow and slow, but for the dictatorship of China, the government's response depends on the preferences of the leaders. The cause of the conflict also has a historical background. China cannot tolerate the fact that it once ruled the whole of China. The Republic of China (Taiwan government) can achieve democracy and economic development, which has a great blow to the legitimacy of the CCP’s totalitarian rule of China, so no matter whether there is a chip or not, they all want to invade Taiwan. In addition, China’s current economy The strength also comes from democratic countries such as the United States, who thought that helping them join the WTO and economic development would allow China to realize democracy, but now they have to pay for the wrong policies of the year, and raised a more totalitarian state with the financial ability to buy advanced weapons to threaten neighboring countries. monsters, such monsters are the main reason why globalization cannot continue
China will have AI like robots that will be trained to kill
Microsoft chips are not the only product. Our government let China steel our intrterlectail property for years. Than they sell back our own products. It's great seeing Peeps build again in our country. Build Americian
Move Silicone valley  to Mexico🤷
This is scary because now I can see why china wants to take over Taiwan omg. No wonder 💭 is no wonder china has to team up with Russia.
China is using Americans software , computer design to get ahead of US
Johnny, China's advances in hypersonic missile technology is not about chips. It was was advances in energetic or propellent, of hypersonic wind-tunnels (they have one), of high temperature metallurgy, of high Mach aerodynamics, of knowledge of plasma around the missiles ... These missiles are vintage 2019. There were no 3nm. chips then. America's being behind in hypersonic missiles is caused by its being behind in a lot of different fields other than chips.
25:15 now they can stop inflating their prices
Long-form content is still alive!
This video was very informative and helpful.
Thx for making us flag slightly larger than the rest 18:13, that is quite explanatory.
你关于台湾和中国关系的叙述，完全是站在美国的立场上的，统一不是入侵，中国的统一不可阻止，你应该学着接受这件事，顺便一提，中国统一后，也许你会为电子产品支付更少的钱就可以得到它。
One question: Why Taiwan?
台灣應該為中華民族的復興貢獻力量，而不是做美國附庸，幫美國反華。反華就是反自己，為種族主義者遞刀。
I am scientist at a University in NC. My PhD was in microfabrication and photolithography. You nailed this video. All of the science content was correct and communicated very well. I enjoyed watching this video because outside of the engineering and science content, I learned a lot. Well Done sir!
China is pretty smart, using the U.S' greedy money hungry addiction against themselves. If there is a world war 3 I blame america.
Just a correction, China is making their own military chips. Military level chips need to be large and robust. The chip war is very little into military competition; most of it is about economic dominance.
Sian countries making chips cheaper because there os SLAVERY AND CHILD EXPLOIT, shame on our countries turning a bkind eye to that unethical act and just focus on our financial Profit. Shame😤
It seems  you have a doubt stand.. you lift  the crook Biden, put trump down beside that you do a okay .
Just amazing.
Solid points. However china is FAAARRR behind in tech. US can make their own chips. Not as advanced as TSMC, just look at AMD vs Intel. An invasion of Tiawan will be the end of China.
Ronald Regan also put a gigantic tariff on Japanese bikes. All cause HD made crap bikes nobody was buying.
hilarious because China doesnt even have the technology to produce semiconductors😂they barely just figured out how to make the ball point of a pen. propaganda got you all. China doesnt own Hong Kong or Taiwan.
看到一半就看不下去了，🤣
There will be many loopholes to bypass the rules.
nice, update?:)
說不知道是一個謊言
*Yep. Most American engineers want regular work hours (80/10, 80/9, or 80/8 even), be home on weekends, hybrid WFH, etc.* *If they're not getting that, it better be temporary, or the pay better be significantly higher to compensate for the shit schedule.*
Generic information gleaned from other YouTube producers.  Asianometry is the one channel that covers this topic in depth, including all the history that preceded and shaped the world as it is now.
I really want you to not to use China to represent my ancestors in the way you are putting China.  It's more like US is againsting "the world". China now in fact has turned into a "world", mixture of other culture things, but not our own ancestors'. I do not see the world sees my ancestors, I do not see my ancestor's spirit and cultures, efforts, but you won't stop talking about China the China you make it up. Crazy
Lol “ the drone that shot this picture is silicon “
I don't watch this guy because it's clear he wants people to recognize him in public. Every video has his face in the foreground.
Leave it to America to fumble a 60 year head start.
Watching Johnny Harris' video is like watching movies...sooo entertaining😊
0:07: 🌍 The US and China are engaged in a war over microchips, which are crucial for both consumer and military technology. 4:59: 🧠 The invention of transistors and silicon chips revolutionized computing by allowing precise control of electricity and enabling the development of more sophisticated technology. 7:53: 🧩 The US leads in chip making, but faces competition from Japan in the 1980s. 12:32: 💡 Taiwan strategically establishes itself as a major player in the microchip industry, creating a Silicon Valley and becoming the masters of FABS. 15:46 - 16:16: 🔬 The chip industry is highly dependent on the US, Taiwan, and China, with China relying on the US and Taiwan for advanced chips. 19:39: ⚔ China's pursuit of self-reliance in chip production and military modernization has led to a reliance on US technology, creating a conflict between the two countries. 23:31: ⚔ The US government is implementing restrictions on the sale of computer chips to China, leading to economic consequences for both countries. 27:32: 💥 The visit of Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan signals the US commitment to protect Taiwan and highlights the importance of Taiwan's chip industry in American security. 31:31: 🌍 The world is turning inward, leading to distrust and rising tensions. Recap by Tammy AI
irregardless of the outcome of tawiwan those plants will never see the end of the war they will be vaporized by either country to ensure no one gets em. america should not have depended on forigen countries to process its chips for defense use outsourcing them to other countries when that should have by law been forced to be made here from the start and we wouldnt have this fiasco  a world war can start because of greed for cheap labour. pathetic
The next stage of the transpacific trade war, and the Netherlands is at the center of it :D  Very cool stuff that will shape this century in my opinion
At 12:26, I see what you did there 😬😬 very clever haha
What should we say? Is it Nuclear age or Silicon age going on?
dang that music
Is this the reason why there is still a car shortage  and consumers continue to get ripped off?
What’s the track name at 10:34 (Tom Fox Producer)
could this be one of the reasons why China wants to get hold of Taiwan?
So the us already went and made a deal with Tsmc. Offering to save his company if they let him replica his company in the us his life work will be save. So he agreed. Now America dont care about Taiwan no more. Us got the chips. So even i chinna still want to take over Taiwan for land but for the chip. America said they will just blow the company in Taiwan. Sad huh
Johnny revealing sins of the world
After a generation of one child policy China is in for a bi of strife soon.
*Imagine getting drafted to war cause you're military doesn't like it's rival's having advanced on-off switches* 🗿
美国对中国做出芯片战争 只会让中国国产芯片加速研发🤣
中国兵法。上站伐谋，其次伐交，再次伐攻！
Hi Nick!!
不太认可视频内容，军用武器对纳米制程要求并不高，稳定性是第一位，中国的中芯国际制造的14nm完全够用，但是目前芯片设计软件是美国垄断的，所以猜测df17导弹 用了美国的软件进行设计。中国的手机厂商都有能力设计芯片，但是不敢设计，因为当初华为推出了麒麟芯片，美国立刻禁止了芯片设计软件，台积电禁止了硅片出口，基本搞垮了这家公司。至于asml 根本不允许出口euv光刻机给中国，详情参考The Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Good and Technologies。客观的来看，在这种封锁下，中国加大力度发展半导体是必然的。但是说实话很艰难，毕竟这是西方国家几十年的积淀，目前中国有进展的领域有12寸硅晶片，arf光刻胶，蚀刻机，特种气体等，没有突破的最主要的有euv光刻机和芯片设计软件。其中euv光刻机是最难突破的，很难很难。但目前对中国有利的一点就是，中国和西方的差距可能不会进一步拉大，因为1nm是硅基芯片的极限，也许未来的战场并不在硅基芯片，而是新的赛道
The problem with globalization and global corporations is that there is no loyalty to any one country because they call no country home.  They dont pay taxes to the countires they are in, they seek out the cheapest labor and most lax environmental regulations, and they sell to the highest bidder and encourage need even if it means fomenting war.
One mistake here, China make their own military chips instead of buying
No mention of Samsung? I know TSMC makes a good majority of chips. But samsung and Korea are just as important to this story.
I’m a programming student in Ohio and we’re all super excited about the INTEL plant coming to New Albany. They’re hiring tons of Electrical Engineers and Computer Science Engineers straight from universities like Ohio State, Cincy and really anywhere they can find people with a knack for programming and circuitry.
He didn't talk about the most critical issue, but just kept hyping up semiconductors, which aroused Westerners' anxiety about China. The United States is afraid that China will take back Taiwan, because the Chinese navy can use Taiwan as a springboard to allow nuclear submarines to easily enter the Pacific Ocean without being detected, breaking the balance of nuclear power in the Pacific Ocean. In addition, the deployment of military forces in Taiwan can cut off all energy and material imports from Japan and South Korea at any time. These two countries are very dependent on energy lines at sea. As a result, Japan and South Korea will have to bow their heads to China and remain neutral or even biased toward China. This would greatly reduce US military influence in Asia. Semiconductors are just one part, but not the most important part. Economically, it is already difficult for the United States to limit China's catching up, but if this trend is curbed before China's military is fully developed, the Americans may still be able to maintain the number one position in the world for a longer period of time.
Another correction, you got the timeline wrong. First is that under trump govt, american was aiming at huawei and put sanctions on huawei, which almost killed a cellphone brand which has 18% share of the global market with a snap. Then china has no other choice to push through for technology independence. CCP has already granted huge amount fund in chip industries but not yet having any break through cos chips are too complicated and it was relying on global collabration for decades, even if you are asking america to build chip by itself, it will need at least 10-20 years to build everything by itself
Well you missed a important issue, is that semiconducter manufacture in taiwan is driven by strong support from then KMT govt, jiang jingguo has raised and poured huge amount of money to support those talented enginneers to open up TSMC, its not at all spontenous.
Thank you for making this video.
Wow it's so cool to learn all about this.
Spent my Saturday from morning to late night watching your videos. You’re the best at breaking down Geopolitics. I can’t stop watching. Learned in one day more than my entire school years. Thank you 🙏🏽
China is the second largest economy now because of 40 years of slave labor...
WE should all take a look at the original agreement Nixon signed with Mao...
This really makes me want a video about living in a simulation.  I mean it’s pretty much confirmed at this point
At least now we can finally go to the moon for real!✌️
The reason we can't "see it", is because *the United States censors its people exactly like China* ... only now through the use of tech companies.
Wait a second we will go this kinda distance to shut down China but leave how much military equipment in Afghanistan??
18:40 Taiwan: 😳 Japan: 👁👄👁
shame what happened with japan here
Taiwan was still an authoritarian regime They held guns to force people from the National Development Council to agree to invest in TSMC
Your videos have a VSauce vibe to them
Do you know what the chip act was done for it was done so United States eventually will not have to go to war with China in other words if United States can produce the same chips that you can get in Taiwan or even better then we don't have to defend Taiwan if China invades and we don't have to have a nuclear war that's what the chip act us is to prevent a nuclear war
You don't know a fact: military chips are not iphone chips.
lol Usa similar with China actually, blocking Huawei TikTok, same authoritarian, n now even block own business to free trade. btw different thing is its safe for woman to walk in midnight in China n can drink alcohol on the street, n list go on.
Taiwanese engineers were lured back to Taiwan because there was a glass corporate ceiling for Asians back then. Morris Chang was denied the CEO position for Texas Instruments despite all of his contributions to the bottom line. TSMC was born from that frustration.
Onsemi just took over GlobalFoundries FABS at the old IBM location in the Hudson Valley, NY.  I should know since I've worked there for the past year.  Onsemi is from Arizona.
Begun the microchip war has*
Same ideology,   …different methods on how to win.
.. BAITED !!   C’on , vaccinations 💉 to protect us !??!  🤦🏻 so angry now !!    Ps awesome content though 😁
just seeing this after China imposed export limits on rare Earth minerals...  USA - Ban chips to china  China-  limit exports of minerals for said Chips - your move USA.. USA- bruh..
“They (China) launched a long-range missile,” General John Hyten, the outgoing vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told CBS News. “It went around the world, dropped off a hypersonic glide vehicle that glided all the way back to China, that impacted a target in China.”18 Nov 2021
In your podcast (which you will make) you will interview people related to the content you cover on your YouTube channel
Reeses Peanut Butter Cups aren’t sold in Trader Joes lol
This nigga giving out plans for china 😂
The vibranium!!!!!!
你说的很对。但是半导体材料的原料大多数来自中国，没有原料，没有人可以制造出芯片。所以中国在前几天已经限制了原料的出口
😢 In fact, the military does not need chips with advanced manufacturing processes, but you have to say that the United States restricts China in order to prevent China's military weapons.  This is what populists want to see, not the truth.
This video will have like 20m views over the next few years when things start really kicking off
Too much focus on Joe Biden, when the anti Chinese chip trade war started with Donald Trump. I was expecting some recognition since everyone made fun of Trump for being so anti China.
You’re the MrBallen of History videos. Thank you
Holys#t , the power of silicon chips
Hi this is Nick. Lol.
why can't china make their own fabs then?
Fan here in the Philippines 🌴
27:10 Hey Editor Person! Down here!   I _really liked_ your choice in music for that transition.  It fit so perfectly, that it pulled me out of the video to make this comment. 😂  Nothing says "Looming Technological Danger" like some 1980s goodness.
Could this microchip manufacturing war speed up ai taking over the world??
Defend Taiwan.
the aussi govt. willing listen (not learning fr. the neighbor kiwis), or follow the big bros. says,  than is no wonder, probably absolutly involved the next region conflict!
Im sure a lot of efforts was put into making this video, but i'd like to point out a few things. First all these high end chips are mostly for consumer products. China is likely to be able to make the lower grade chips used in military by themselves. Second, I was expecting some analysis of the Chinese own chip industry whether it can catch up. From your video, one would think there is no such industry in China. But in fact they are able to make some low end chips without any external help.
Hasn't the USA left it far too late for this strategy to work? China has already got the chips it needed to develop it's weapons. China will soon / now be producing the chips it wants for itself in China.
Incredible journalism
It could be Gallium Arsenide... just sayin.
The emails
Cold War II
So you sold one of your biggest competitors advanced computer chips and they surpassed you, then you thought it was a good idea, to stop selling them chips.. like the logic escapes me here.. so you think they're gonna be like "Oh well they don't like our military prowess so we gonna just roll over" hahahaha America need to chill out
One thing about japan is that once it took a back seat to making chips itself, japan decided to be the country that makes the machines that make the chips. In addition to the machines that make the chips japan makes the chemicals that adhere to the chips and nearly have a global monopoly on said materials. Japan is still very much in the chip game just not so overtly.
Nvidia is just fine now

OMG... Love for the other part of the world ...TANZANIA from africa ..This has been so insightful in a most entartaining manner ever...JOHNNY YOU ARE THE BEST BRUH
Tit for Tat, there is nothing new in this conflict which America calls the Cold War!" there's nothing wrong with this new outcome, which we all see what's going on in the real field, which we all predict, and it's happening, if the US pushes China so hard, then China will return it same circumstance, Which are we all predict and assume it's happening, all those things!🙄🙄 And there's nothing wrong with that, You may know one thing, if you love someone, then What kind of love do you have? If you don't fight for this love, the same thing goes to war also!"

Hilarious, well told story @johnnyharris
China hasnt even caught up to the USA bro relax
I love chips 🍟
The conspiracy theory rumor, is that the very first silicate microchips were discovered on a crashed flying saucer.😮
Absolutely magnificent video, simply marvellous.  Deadly video, simply awesome. Unbelievable hard work, humongously deep research and effort has gone into production of this terrific video. Watching from Bangalore India.
You got your timeline wrong, after hellish withdrawal on Afghan, two nuclear power country smelled weakness and started moving, one in Ukraine and one in Taiwan... Now Biden is making a move to remove asset on Taiwan and put in US before China take over Taiwan.
What was not emphasized enough in the video, is all the collateral damage this Economic/Technological Cold War has had on jobs in the United States, and elsewhere.   Even U.S. ally, South Korea, had a negative impact when their government heavily subsidized memory chips in the late 1990s.
Show this video to all your Libertarianism friends and relatives. Similar things have also happened in the pharmaceutical industry. The United States is highly dependent on China and India for drugs, including antibiotics.
Funny enough USA neva shows their secret
Now China started banning USA chips like micron what is thst😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Johnny Harris is a brilliant History teacher.
China could kidnapped  the engineering team in Taiwan
China can just have a small country buy the equipment and just pray them for it
Can you stop playing the annoying music in the background? It has the sleazy vibe of a history channel fake documentary
I took a class in my university about going from transistors to logic gates, using logic gates to make different logical operators’ gates, arithmetic computation gates for small numbers, one-bit memory…..cool stuff
What’s the name of the song from 2:34 to 2:48 ish? Plz 🙏🏻
All the things you touched were also made with petroleum as well lol
And I bet some in congress bought stock in these companies. It’s a huge racket.
Trump actually cut China off not the alzheimers patient that's currently in office

US is only in a mental state of greed and fear. It is the basis, as in many other things (all the crimes in various ways that the US and Westerners commit around the world). US technology came from a vacuum? US scientists don't stand on the shoulders of other scientists from around the world, from different times and regions? Was it all just the brainchild of Americans developing the technology?  No other human involvement?  Stupidity and greed are indeed two things that know no bounds, before death.
1:04 -  1:45  Just showing off🤨
Hi nick!!!!!!
My cat has a chip in him and i know the gal who did it to him.
Hey I work for TI. The big arms race it quantum computing. Whoever gets there first will be able to turn off all of their enemies grids. Lock their enemies out of their computers. Launch their enemies' nukes and aim their enemies cities.
There is no way the chart at 16:58 is true.  Intel produces a shitload outside of taiwan.
Throw in cyberspace and the race to get back to the moon and it's going to be a fun decade. China is going to militarize the moon. In the military, the high ground wins. Lunar dominance for China neutralizes our satellites. Lastly, chips or fabs, remember we could be going to war with a country that could dwarf our WW2 industrial output. A war with China comes down to the Wyatt Earp gunfighting philosophy "fast is fine, but accurate is final"
You forgot about the failed attempts of Chinese semi conductor manufacturing and the factory that TSMC are building in the US.
China does only do IP theft, they been stealing American tech for years, hint the J-20 and even AI.
Video is mindblowing but the blur effects are really irritating tbh !
As usual, great video but, can you have a good hair day and ditch the wizard hat?
From trade war chip war is  begin
Reagan gets mocked when he puts the American people first by making chips in the US and protecting US technology. When Donald Trump mentions it he is called a Xenophobic. When Biden does it he get praised. Your Bias is showing Johnny
Basically USA government is a douche.
i want a bag of lays chips now
That's not a war, it's basic capitalism, if the west doesn't want war it should stop using that word but it won't, it does want war, it's not giving money and weapons to Taiwan out of love and generosity. Fortunately, the Chinese seem to be immune to such childish behavior, great.
Thanks!
I love this dude
Can people stop using the term leveling up if you're not playing a video game. We're not in a videogame this is real life.
2000s- Halliburton Wars. 2020s-TSMC Wars, baby !!!
Ooooo!! You showed Taiwan as a separate county!!  You're in trouble Budd!
oh and if you really want to get into embargoes and blockades, the u.s. navy excels at this.  has anyone heard of the Malacca straits?
its a fair game... the u.s. military budget requires a peer group enemy, Japan could not rise to the occasion, Germany could not rise to the occasion, the Soviet Union could not rise to the occasion, Russia could not rise to the occasion, the Middle East could not rise to the occasion, and im afraid china will not be able to rise to the occasion.  even tho we subsidized china and gave them our secrets, they are incapable of becoming a peer group enemy..  im afraid we will have to contact the aliens and subsidize them in warp drive technology to grow a near peer group enemy to continue raping the American taxpayer for higher defense company stock prices...but hey, it funds my retirement account and enables the Bahamas to also share in the  rising standard of living by selling me a hut on the beach and mixing my margaritas.
Too late China has copied it already, they will just improve it they can make it much better than the original
we will eat all market of chips, smart phone , car, airplan and so on , just wait
Bringing the fabs to America creates living wage jobs
As always, very instructive Johnny. I am always looking forward to your videos. On this topic you forgot another crucial part of all this. To build new semiconductor lasers anywhere you would need the key resource, neon. Ukraine supplies almost if not 50% of the world's semiconductor grade neon. This is all a coordinated attack of the Communist party to the Free Democratic world to increase the price if not halt the making of new semiconductor factories, making any technological advances even more challenging. Now you know.

Military needs the best chips? There was news about US military still using Windows XP because of its reliability and interdependence between various systems.
I knew we were sold out by corporate America. But I wasn't aware they are traders also .
My friend, try to be less american while being a quite cool world citizen ;)
Everything from Chiba is fake, including military mite
let's hope that this war can lead to a tech leap for mankind, not a “smart war" to end all civilization.
It’s past time the world deglobalize.
For a nation that thinks and plans ahead decades, the reactionary move of the US was probably anticipated. I'm curious what China's counter will be.
And all of these companies buy the chip "printing" tech from: ASML which uses photolithography. (even TSMC)
If the Chinese can't copy it, they can't produce it.
Winner channell yntegran ator libing nonbre legasi
Absolutely amazing video! You helped explain these complex situations in a really easy to understand way and I learned a lot from this video. It's crazy how the world is evolving.
I love how this kid hates on Ragan but probably voted for Biden 😂😂 the irony is unreal
Microchips and semiconductors are not the same thing. Semiconductors are used to create chips. It's like saying that lithium and batteries are the same thing.
👋🏼 1:50 hi Nick!
Love your stuff
Čína sa poistila😂😂😂
A pretty incomplete story by not explaining the absolute power of ASML in the chip FAB business and how the US has forced the company not to sell their chip fabrication machines to China.
“Wait what the hell Ronald Regan” 💀
한국에 대한 내용이 없어서 안도감을 느낀다 ㅋㅋ
Nice video production, but the content is just a shitty recycling of American anti-China bigotry and it's full of flaws. From the start, Taiwan is not and never was a country, it is legally and historically part of China before the US even existed. Next time try to put at least the most basic facts straight.
No, semiconductors is a category that includes integrated circuits. Integrated circuits are semiconductors; but semiconductors are also things like discrete capacitors, diodes, resistors,t transistors, and more. The volume of discrete semiconductors is probably 100x that of advanced integrated circuits. Don't call chips semiconductors; it shows you don't understand.
Have to say, between Chinese mainland & Taiwan island, there's no invasion, it's a civil war not finished yet since 1945, no agreement was signed so far.
So basically Biden did what Democrats slammed Trump for saying we should’ve done a long time ago. Lol these clowns will literally attack that man for everything and then turn around and do everything they criticize him for the only difference is it took them about six years longer to figure it out.
If TSMC has moved a Fab to the US then that kind of means that Taiwan will soon no longer be important to the US as they already got their treasure out of Taiwan. That’s scary as it means the US will likely withdraw their support for Taiwan leaving the island open to China. Seems a crazy move from TSMC’s position to have put a factory on US soil. We’ve seen what the US does to its “friends” once they are no longer needed like the debacle in the withdrawal from Afghanistan
Feel so complicated as a Chinese
The US is a big bully has-been for a long time other countries are getting tired of the bully.
Mean while Harris says is scary that China might invade Taiwan which is part of China just like Hawaii is part of the US. The US actually has invaded Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Livia, Hawaii, Mexico and countless other countries but that's not seen as scary.
Taiwan is part of China it has been for along time why are you onesiding this monolog  with propaganda for America.
START THE PODCAST
Can you cover Pelosi's trip to Taiwan? Because the air travel itself was the closest thing to Cuba missile crisis I've ever experienced It was breathtaking.
This illustrates a number of basic realities: Fist of all, this shows the deadly poison concepts like One World and world Free Trade. It also shows the deadly danger of dependence or reliance  On basic semi conductor electronics. Because, the entire subject of this video, The centrality of everything depending on semi conductors, is insane because ONE Ultra Cheap ENP Device over Kansas City and 95+% of the semi conductor and especially any and all semi processor dependent systems just became boat anchors. God forbid we listen to any of the serious physicists and even the US Govt commission on ENP. No chance of that folks..... Between the US Chamber of Commerce's one world trade advocacy over the last 45+ years and the hundreds of thousands of red Chinese agents and assets in the US, the largest espionage  Force in world history, the future is, well, grim or at least very guarded to say the least.....
China won they own Taiwan the best chips come from there.
This isn't even a fight over different ideologies of the world, its just straight up fight for supremacy. That is all this is.
AMERICA HAD WRONGLY PUT HIS AROGANCY TO CHINA FOR CHINA IS NOT JAPAN AT ALL...!!!. LET'S SEE ONLY TWO YEARS LATER IN 2025....!!!!. IS CHINA STILL NEED AMERICA CHIPS OR NOT AT ALL..!!!!
The anti-China rhetoric is pretty disguisting tbh.
Are you still working for NATO, Johnny?
Why else would Nancy Pelosi go to Taiwan
Wrong. Nice try shill
Hats off to the entire team for this amazing content. ❤
lol i love the taiwan is looking at its neighbour taiwan despite us rhetoric is china taiwanese people are chinese they pushed out what later became our maoori here in new zealand but m,ake no mistake those white as chinese speaking looking people are not taiwanese and never have been they are chinese who want to break away from china much like america is british people wwho broke away from britain and like america thier claim to independance is built on the bones of the original people who rightfully own the land and well if woke as england wont give ireland back to the irish why would china give taiwan to people who arent even indigenous americans eh just gloss over the truth every time
Excuse me, China owns that Micro Chips !  Robert Bob Cabana and all Mexicans at NASA and Pentagon, get off your Virtual CAMERAS !!!!
Briefly, as a prosperous and powerful civilization, China has existed for thousands of years. The history of 100 years of colonial aggression in modern times is called a century of national humiliation，tens of millions of Chinese were slaughtered by the invaders，then China went into civil war, the defeated regime fled to the Chinese territory of Taiwan (which had been colonized by Japan and It was returned to China after its defeat in World War II), and when the PRC tried to reclaim the territory,the US stopped the PRC and humiliated China with its power(like South Korea and North Korea, the US wanted to counterbalance the Soviet Union).China did not complete national reunification for 70 years due to US blocking.Chinese people suffered too much until the founding of the PRC，every Chinese has the shame of national history and the desire for national prosperity，so the PRC appears to be a socialist country, but it is actually a nationalistic country，that is why China is unlikely to become a voting system and the country will go to extreme populism.When China was unified, it marked the end of an era of bullying removed，that is why the Taiwan question is not an economic, technological or military issue，every Chinese desire for national unity lasted for 70 years and it wasn't about some bullshit chip and that is why you should not underestimate the determination of the Chinese people and government on the Taiwan question，Many people believe that China is now militarily and economically weak, and Taiwan has military help from the US and its Allies, so China will not invade even if Taiwan declares independence，I just want to say never underestimate the national mood of 1.4 billion people.When Taiwan declares independence, we will attack once, twice, or three times until we win,if the US and its Allies attack Chinese territory, it's gonna escalate to a nuclear war soon，the world will end.
If not because China and TW share same language, it would have nothing to do with Semi-conductor industry. In this area it would still be at Stone Age. Certainly, US helped TW build it’s Semi-conductor industry. Even though, China showed no gratefulness to TW instead of trying to invade TW. Don’t forget, the communist China had directly fight against USA.
What about us? I mean Africans 😂 only God can judge us😏😂
Hey Nick, I am also referred to as nick from time to time.
It’s a pity you tell your whole story from Washington narrative, it would be nicer to tell the story in a neutral way. Actually military don’t need the most cutting edge chips, they prefer more mature and reliable chips. This is an economic competition issue more than a military one. You said it in the beginning of the video, Japan got hit because they made better chips than the US. Is Japan a military threat to the US at that time? Blamed everything on military tech is vey misleading.
all i want to say is you do not know the history of china even do not know Chiness not all。
How many times did Johnny say “chips”?
Lol china has hypersonic missile and us dont have technology to intercept
Johnny 5:32  thats not a transistor…. thats an electron tube or valve. Tubes control/alter  current flow via a suspended vacuum, voltage plates and electrodes. Similar functions at a 10,000ft glance but entirely different physics. You should do a video on Tubes! And how the war in Ukraine nearly brought the guitar amp world to its knees (tube manufacturers are specialized and quite a few of the biggest players are in Ukraine and Russia)
Light bulb as well?, OK?, let's research first shall we?.
Thank You I can learn English with yours videos. Its interesting way!
GONNA START WORK ON MY FOOLPROOF BULLSHIT DETECTOR
THERE YOU TUBE! i did it without bullying or cussing and please quit hacking my comments you COMMIES
We have big problems Johnny and we know it but we need realistic solutions to them all where can we start or what should we do? I am not an expert on anything and don't claim to be. But with everyone who is or claims to be one of which there are many on the web these days...can't they all get together and brainstorm a realistic solution to the world''s problems if not they all need to ESTEEEFYOUU. STFU
taiwan is not a country i must correct u taiwan is a part of China
Enough with the beanie. Your inside.
16:31 "And this is why we have nice things."
Watching this while eating chips 🤌
这位老兄也许懂技术，也或许懂地缘政治，但是绝对不懂中国。中国要统一台湾不是因为什么芯片，因为1949年芯片都还没有出来，更别说更早的清朝了，中国的大一统意识外国人理解不了。至于芯片，美国现在有霸权地位，可以威胁盟友像日本、荷兰和台湾不要卖半导体材料、设备和加工给中国，如果在一个公平的环境下，中国制造出自己的芯片要简单的多。即便如此，中国依靠全国产设备依然可以做到28nm的芯片，而目前世界上应用的芯片90%以上都是28nm以上制程，所以即便美国制裁，中国也不会受到太大的影响。美国的确在科技领域给全人类带来很多的贡献，不得不钦佩，中国的历史文化里面也确实缺少科技的成分，中国有很多可以向西方学习的地方，但是作为一个5000年文明史的中国，一个天生的骄傲的大国，绝对不会自甘落后。中国人的智商不低，只要我们意识到了科学的重要性，那么我们在这些领域就一定会做出成绩来。中国从封建社会走出来不过短短百年时间，真正安定下来搞发展不过40多年时间，就这么短短几十年中国就取得了西方几百年的成绩，有什么理由怀疑中国未来不更好？只要美国不狗急跳墙主动发动战争，再给中国30年和平的发展环境，我坚信中国全面超越美国就一定会实现。希望看到这个片子的中国人，心中要有一口气，在自己的工作领域努力工作，为我们的国家和民族发展贡献力量。中国不是小国，没办法像其他小国一样在大国的荫蔽下喝点汤就满足，我们从来不甘只当观众，登顶是我们唯一的选择，加油吧！
America, you have to be confident.
18:45 fun fact companies like TI and intel heavily dependent on banglore india for software analog. us palyed a bug role but with the crucial help of india
thanx teacher Harris! pleasure as always. 😅
You shoulder cover the quantum computer race.
Why can’t they make it themselves?
Hi Nick
Military supremacy . Taliban is the top
Misinformation . Military don't need most advance chip
Johnny we must stop educating them. Cornell near my house is dominated with Chinese students. WTF
This is more about the economy and US hegemony. They're trying to limit China's growth like they did to Japan.  Once the US has they're own FABs in full production Taiwan will left out in the cold. It's all about staying No1 topdog, and the US elite won't care if that means burning down the world to stay there.
Covid-19 was introduced as a consequence
Silicon and Microchips or semiconductors are what make the world move and wouldn't have the amazing technology we enjoy including my phone without them
从此再无台积电，只有美积电，等台湾的高科技移到美国那一刻，有没有台湾对美国也就不重要了。
It’s a lot more than 🇺🇸 vs 🇨🇳. It’s more like the entire rest of the world vs NATO.   NATO keeps enabling 🇺🇸 which has the entire rest of the world held up by its military.   Really the rest of the world just wants 🇺🇸 to fuck off and die I feel.  💚💚💚
Thanks!
Ъ.ъ
This does make solid sanse more than this whooha floating on the internet.
Silica from melted SAND =  SILICONE= CHIP = MICRO PROCESSOR= semiconductor for automobiles, satellites, telescopes, F16, Mig's, stealth bombers, drones and toys, and spy gears!!! Enough to start The War of self-destruction?   Why looking for a hideaway in Amazonia, we can build more expensive marine carriers and submarines to house all the rich and God's chosen people: note, singular - just one RACE.
Semiconductors are not the same as microchips. You can have a semiconductor on its own with no 'microchip' properties.
FYI microchips are not metal lmao
Who knows if Chiba already hasn’t owned her own semiconductor technology. Hundreds of those engineers who have spent their lives producing the US brand chips are actually Chinese.
Bro was right..
the U.S. has the performance, China the production. and it so way lopsided with those it's crazy there is competition at all.
The movie departed predicted this.
Taiwan is not a country
The 2nm process is not 2nm. It became a marketing gimmick after around 14nm.
US has NO advantage over China; they are both just big customers. Technology bottleneck is at Taiwan & Korea, who actually produce the 2nm microchips and ASML, the only company that sells the machine to Taiwan & Korea to make these chips.   "software equipment" "chip design" HAHAHA what a cope. US is not even leading in chip design anymore.
If Trump did this what Joe did, he’d he would be called racist. He was so much ahead of this clowns!
Your videos are so interesting and informative this is my favorite channel keep it up Johnny !!! ❤
Maybe get ride of all that and maybe you can get back to the moon. Hahaha imagine using a calculator to get to the moon. Funnier thing is we in Australia saw a coke bottle on the moon since we got the direct wider screen feed and other people had the smaller view with the camera pointing at the screen for their “live” feed
Okay everyone, we can hack our job networks and if caught can tell them Johnny Harris said we had to do it. Screw your Centrelink!!! Heheeh😂
Microchips are not "tiny pieces of metal that run our world".
Tons of thanks, Johnny
Best acronym solution to world war which may have a ripple martial law effect... EMP!
Meanwhile me watching this on my Ipad while working on my Computer and chatting with my mobile:  Interesting 🤔
Great video
China can’t get access to the most modern computer chips anymore due to the CCP’s espionage programmes which is going to cause a lot of economic issues over the next few years. Especially since, as their population ages replacing people with advanced automation is going to get very hard.  Also statistics from CCP organisations, especially in relation to economic growth are worth nothing!
is it too late? I mean china had those chips and those could be a perfect sample for them to replicate. If theres anything we know about china is that they can , they will and they are good at counterfeiting things or improving and even selling it at cheaper price. but im not expert just asking,
China has something. No way they would run test and risk exposing themselves.
War is what you call a competition you have to cheat at to win.
Basically , US just want a new rival after the fall of USSR. So they just helped their rival , to rival the US.
Thanks for explaining this chip issue I was unaware of. No wonder the skirmish involving Taiwan and China. It felt intense in its persistence and consistence newsworthy consistency.
Johny, In US there is blurry line between millitary and businesses too. Its just that people outside of the millitary do not know about it.
China already developed their own chip, so.... the biggest loser all of this is the US.  Hehe
The same applies to Russian Forex reserves being weaponized by sanctions.
So glad I found this channel, your videos are very informative and on point!  Keep up the good work
HELP TIWAWN!!!!!!!!!
I think this war is clearly evident in any big west coast city ie Portland,LA, San Francisco.. China is trying and succeeding to destroy of society with in. And no one is seeing this. Not to mention all the land they buy in Canada, so again I see this war on our way of life everywhere!
hitech viruschip is originate at US to china then blame it to taiwan or to russia etc..👽👁👁
Filipino invented microchip.,😊and most factory worker in Taiwan is Filipino.,
awesome
this is mind blowing !!!
Are you my favorite teacher? Thanks for asking YES you are!
Amazing vid
This guy js outdated or what? China made decisive breakthrough on chip! Or lapsided in his analysis
damn it must be interesting family dinners at the harris house on christmas
China invent gunpoder and they ban us made guns. I mean bla bla..wrong
Love you johnathan
Chips are the new Oil.
This is what happens when political and business power goes to mediocre people this people only care about their position rather than development and innovation they ignore innovation people and hire stupid puppet people now they are fighting for semiconductor and just few years they will fight for bread poor souls
Whose here after china is running military drills on taiwan waters taunting the USA
😂 asian or corporation or smart people or politicians are good at making money "under the table". Good luck to those Block block block. I bet you they all will find a way to build a factory that can do what Taiwanese can do in China. 😂 that the reality of this planet. People will follow the money. 😂😂😂
The bill gates jumping over a chair will always get me. That was great editing
We are sanctioning our self. Saying we need chips to be made here wont work. It is making the big wigs loaded, gov folks loaded. It's like fauci saying, take this shot i have investments in
中国大陆与台湾的关系源自历史，台湾在数百年前就属于中国，那时候还没有美国，与芯片无关。
All inventions were made in the US and the UK
China using capitalism to beat the US in military technology…an awesome uno reverse card. But the US smarten up.
Taiwan should destroyed every manufacturing fabs and other raw materials. So that way if china actually captures Taiwan well it will cost china billions and billions of dollars . That will setback china for a decade and the engineers should flee to the u.s.China might try to invade Taiwan in 2024 when u.s have there elections and it depends who wins. If a Russian Republican wins china will invade.
Thak you so much for your video. You made it really easy to understand about the war over microchips in the world. I saw news about it but never understand them😂
There is a proverb a donkey became so weak even could not walk but never stop farting.😅😅😅😅
This was actually what Trump as businessman president was hired for. And failed, critically
By your explanation I came to know how much you hate china not to be above you (US).
Johnny Harris and the team total fucking you tube legends 10 out of 10  top marks
There's microchips in the trader Joe's Reese's !!!!! Don't eat them
Hi, NICK!  😉
That Chinese spy balloon makes much more sense now
washington always using its allies in the frontline the US just never going in alone even though the US might have the upperhand...
China please forbid US Companies to manufacture in China. The US would be screwed
eh, completely missed the ARM Architecture, designed by a UK Company
Most of you probably don't know...but China is designing & building some very sophisticated FABS at an unbelievable pace...really scary !!! US actions have forced them to be self reliant and are now moving into this elite arena !!! Well done Joe..you've just lost access to the largest chip market in the world...generating chip excess & created a new competitor !
Give you props johnny this is fire 💯
thx
That light and mic at the end there have chips
I always wondered about how Tiny Taiwan is still safe from the Chinese invasion.  That's when I heard about TSMC
TSMC is currently synonymous with Semi-conductor
Jesus, you're telling me we're in a proverbial cold war with China with Captain Dementia at the helm and a bunch of woke congressmen and companies that bend over backwards to appease China?  That is when they're not cramming their woke agenda down our throats?  Well...we're well and truly ****ed.
Please make Johnny Harris video about palsitin and israel conflict by doing this you will save many young kids life
We will fight them eventually! We just postponing it, which is not smart. Now is the time to strike before they get stronger.
Teacher : so, class, what did you understand from this video about world economy Me : I'm now going to eat a Reese's peanut butter cup from Trader Joe's
It's not metal. It's silicon.
Don't forget china's active policy of stealing intellectual property
So the US is basically responsible for the Japan Bubble Burst?
台灣第一
Great work!
5:17 Geoffrey Dummer, Malvern uk engineer. 1952 US conference, came up with the idea of the integrated circuit.
5:33 transistors are and never were thermionic tubes.
Do you mean joe Biden handlers told him to do…
Globilzation doesn't work, because they force one viewpoint, idea, or "tradition" on you. IE let's do business, but if you don't do what we say we will punish you economically. Both sides are guilty. Although, I'd argue China subjegates it's people more than anyone else. US liberal idealogy is more expansionists though only because of the current ifluence they hold & are losing.
Johnny Harris: Joe Biden rolling up his sleeves.   Me: Joe Biden falling up stairs. lol
i'll tell you where silicon isn't in      my ass....     yet...
Solution: the US needs to invest the billions of dollars it will take to manufacture its own microchips.   or delete China.
Much love brother
We dont have a prime minister in Taiwan😂
tiwan is part of china
The most insufferable video from this guy yet. Why so generous ? why don't you swallow rest of the information too ? Clearly there is too much details.
The real biggest giveaway was by Nixon/ Kissinger to give them money/ resources to do all this.
you can count the number of large cap US semiconductor mfgs on one hand
Indians too had plans of building fabs but the stupid government had a pass on it terming it as fancy not important tech. A large part of chip design and software is done in India by Indian engineers working in Indian offices of these chip makers.
You're good 👌
This is why countries hate us. We throw our weight around anytime we get behind on a tech or something upsets us. Like a big bully on the world market. Its the kind of shit that gives a person insomnia.
Safe To Say, The US Sold Itself Out 🤦🏾‍♂️
nice
Johnny Harris is that conspiracy guy who hates his own country so much and yet been sheltered his whole life, everything he discovers is like the invention of sliced bread to him and he just gets so over the top intense to sell it to people and tries to act like its not crazy.
I think this channel is not bias. Keep up the good work. High tech inventions, AI and all sort of pride hv made them miserable and stupid to it. Is that the karma from their cruelty?
wow very nicely simplify definitely a like.
Great video! I especially enjoyed how well the author described what semi-conductors are. Detailed, but easy to understand explanation. Well done, awesome communication here!
Just remember when this war happens that our own US companies and supposed leaders sold us out.
Scalar is trash please do not accept their sponsorships
Who raised the issue first?  Trump!
Not even a single second I was bored. It's a half and hour video i watched all
Azhhuuuuuuuu shhhh
Great vid on semiconductors total  garbage on the 1972 One China Policy. Taiwan is a province of China. It’s not worth nuclear war to try to blow that up.
I love your videos thanks to you and your entire team.
You had me until you said "they need it for their Military..." XD  MHmmm...
Good job
Remember Toy Soldier?
Hell week for me Johnny is when I miss your podcasts!
you say there is no silicon in the analog cameras, but what about the silicon in the glass that is used to make the lenses?
Great content like always.
MAGIC LASER MACHINES 18:13 so funy.... good...
Only bad thing US lost a huge market. Lot of billions
I learnt so much from this video, thank you!
the usa is the cancer of this planet
Even I (not an expert) know that aircraft, aviation, missiles, etc. do not require high process chips because of the high requirement for reliability and anti-interference. Most military chips are manufactured in the 65-120 nm process (also in the United States), and many countries can produce them without the need for "American technology".   The so-called "China uses American technology to enhance its military strength against the United States" is entirely an excuse. Firstly, military chips are not American technology, secondly, Chinese troops are not deployed overseas to "against the US". Finally, American military equipment also uses a large amount of alloys, materials, and technology from China.   The advanced chips purchased by China are fully used for commercial activities. Limiting China's access to, or even independent manufacturing of, advanced chips is primarily aimed at maintaining the advantages in next-generation industries, artificial intelligence, and other fields, which completely violates the principle of free market competition. This will greatly disrupt global supply chains, raise product prices, and ultimately destroy high-tech companies in the United States.🙄
Yes to 'The Johnny Harris Podcast' 👇👇
I gotta say, your videos are frickin' awesome! The editing and special effects are off the chain, and you always come up with the most interesting and entertaining content. You're seriously killing it on YouTube!  But, I gotta give you a little feedback - all them ads are getting annoying, man. I know you gotta make some dough to keep producing these sick vids, but three ad breaks in one video is too much. It's like, "Come on dude, let me watch the damn video!"  I'm not trying to hate, I just wanna keep watching your stuff without getting interrupted by ads all the time. Maybe you can find some other way to make some cash that won't be so in-your-face for us viewers?  Anyway, keep up the amazing work! Your videos are seriously top-notch.
There’s erroneous thinking that everything needs a MICROchip. A lot of things can get away with MACROchips. No need to go MICRO when MACRO can do.
so that is why silicon valley bank collapsed....? asking for a friend since the start ups in silicon valley bank used for them chips?
Johnny harris is such a sellout lmao
This is one of the best pieces of news I’ve ever seen
Mexico
We need to start recycling chips
5:32 Vacuum tubes are not transistors. They serve a similar function, but operate inherently different.
Great video!!
Video saturation/ contrast set to negative 1000
Did you know you can level up your skills with scaler?
I recently, subscribed to your content wow it’s mind blogging! I must say
Its like making a trade blunder in Civ
Oh so it's like the trade war between trump and and xi
During the 60's 70's 80's lot of movies about countries fight and kills to get their hands on lastest tecno.
Hi, Nick.
Thanks!
Provide better video/more info before dropping the sponsor ad. Bye
when you watch this and add the AI race  - you can easily begin to see why the tiktok ban is happening.
ASML in the Netherlands is the key player
Netherlands has the most important job though. Can't make those chips without those machines, and even with the good chips Taiwans chips aren't as good. Guess who Netherlands is more so in business with. It ain't China.
Man that is a thing, thanks for analyse.
I live in Silicon Valley. I remember when I was a teenager there were so many semiconductor plants here.
Me and Johnny Harris have the same microwave 😂
Brilliant video, concise and informative, many kudos. But I do think that describing the Chinese Mainland and Taiwan as just ‘neighbors’ or two nations that had a bit of a history lacks the nuances the situation deserves. It is much more akin to ‘estranged siblings’ that are each associated with some very dangerous people.   While the island of Taiwan along with Kinmen and Matsu were never absorbed back into PRC, it never officially claimed independence from Beijing either, which leaves it is the politically ambiguous state that inherits the name Republic of China (the flag you used for the map), with a government derived from the nationalist era of China which never officially ended the Chinese Civil War with the mainland government.  Taiwan has enjoyed and suffered a lot of unique situations due to this political limbo. And while with its own de facto government and military, it officially does not have diplomatic ties with any country on a national level, which makes it all the more sensitive as the center of geopolitical tension between the US and China when sovereignty comes into question.  Were it just another independent and legally recognized nation like, say, Singapore, then the situation would not be as delicate as it is. Just thought I’d mention it as it is oft taken as fact that Taiwan is ‘just another country’ when it comes to those discussions, a sentiment that is no doubt very much aligned with the interest of the US, who loves to present it as an uncontested fact of life, but is not the entire truth.
Since you think the chip led China to lead the US in hypersonic missiles. But then you say that the US has the most advanced technology of all for chips. So why are hypersonic missiles not as advanced as China's? You are being inconsistent.
Drinking game suggestion. Every time he says chip you take a shot
Hey Nick
Awesome video, but don't forget without ASML basically none of this would be possible. Netherlands literally hold the key to help making these chips
US new factories can't come up with what china could do. The human resource is the most important factor. The salary that US could potentially pay to employees is way more higher than equivalent china's version. The initial reason why from beginning many factories went to china was these factors

It's like you're an Olympic athlete, and you find that your opponent is not slower than you. Instead of wondering why you're not running faster, your first reaction is to be fixated on the fact that your opponent had eaten the bread sold by your family at noon. You shout out: "What? You ate my bread, got stronger, and still want to run faster than me!"
Love the work done, specially the undeniable quality, it’s giving the filling of getting into the most complicated matters of the world in a very short period of time with a single click 🫡👌🏽
I'm thinking it was Hunter  Biden who sold out the secrets to the chips, and what about poor Japan... they got ripped off 100% another reason to hate America...... better whatch out pearl harbor all over again... except with technological fallout ..
this video disappoints... in terms of editing
In the military, chips are only used to perform simple mathematical calculations and do not require high-performance chips. Besides, even the United States knows not to use Chinese-made cameras or drones. Would China put American chips in missiles or military computers with American chip design software? The US blockade of high technology is only to slow down China's economic development, and preventing China's military development is just an excuse. In fact, China's military has been blocked by the United States for decades, but now it is the world's second or third largest. The blockade is useless. If the blockade worked, China would not have new missiles and large destroyers. Similarly, the blockade will only make China's chip industry rise more rapidly, just like military blockade. Thanks to Biden. Without Biden's chip blockade, China's high-tech industry would never have known that the United States would actually block chips, nor would it have the urgent need for the rise of the domestic chip industry as it does now, nor would it have adopted domestically produced chips that were low-end at the time. Now, Chinese high-tech companies are forced to choose low-efficiency but expensive domestic chips, which will inevitably lead to the rapid growth of the chip industry. Even if the United States reopens the Chinese market with low-priced, high-performance chips in the future, Chinese companies will not simply follow suit. They will inevitably retain a portion of the profits for domestic chips to ensure that they are no longer restrained by the US chip blockade.
johnny reminds me of jake gyllenhall
jus found this channel, watchin all your vids. great stuff; keep up good videos.
Whoever makes the background music for your videos, I need a name right ducking now!
Nvidia thanks a lot assholes
It's important to understand: the transistor changed the world not because it could control the flow of electricity (we had devices that can do that way before of transistors) but because it made it possible to have much more logic devices in the same area.
"tiny pieces of metal"? well.... this one you got wrong, but of no importance for the story.
The US is just forcing China to develop their own chip great job Joe
The fact that the world’s most advanced chip maker is in Taiwan is more the fault of u.s. stupidity than brilliance on the part of Taiwanese
I hope we built self-destruct features into the semiconductor manufacturing equipment we sold to Taiwan over the decades. Actually, I'm sure we did. If China invades Taiwan they will find a bunch of equipment that goes haywire and can't be repaired. Americans have a great capacity to have fucked their enemies long before they were officially enemies. I find this trait refreshing. America will always land on top even after the nukes start flying.
Which is why the U.S. needs to stockpile more nuclear weapons. The only solution when you live next to an enemy is to have bigger guns than he does. "Peace through superior firepower!"
16:16 Just a ... yeah... . Please check this:  https://www.asml.com/en/technology/all-about-microchips/microchip-basics https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8IGkNhvIaA&t=6s&ab_channel=BloombergTechnology They work togheter but everything happend in Veldhoven, and you should give the right credit

*Quantum Computers enters chat*
I mean Hollywood in the 80s ,90s , I think was all about stealing Chips . 😭
Thought it was Chris Bumstead that  started talking micro chips.
After him saying FABS, M.A.D.S. and S.M.I.L.E.S. echoed in my mind. Then bit by bit, it started to ressemble Doffy, Ceasar, and Kaido.
Sounds like your trying to sound like lex freeman on your pod cast part lol
Day late and dollar short
Where is Samsung in all of this...?
Taiwan is just a island in Republic of China not a country
You didn’t discuss the R&D move away from silicone based chips towards organic chips etc and the players involved in that which might change everything making this all obsolete 🤷🏼‍♀️
All cos they were in bed with China in the first place... Trump admin was way ahead but someone felt his business was suffering... I think china has enough spies in china to push back adequately
when you said China military need chips from USA, I couldn't help laughing at your ignorance. 🤣
More doggy US propaganda to scare the world to believing that China is a threat to the world.    The US can't clean up its own house but can shoot bullets into windows of other houses.
We are breathing in these chips via chem trails.
I think it's because China is threatening America's number one position in the world, they just want to defeat China just like the USSR
Taiwan is not a country😅😅,it’s part of china

'Biden rolls up his sleeves'? HA! very funny.
I want my chips!!!!!!!!! Them Chinese ain’t taking my chips………….😈🔥USA💯
Regan is mentioned but not the Clintons.  Odd since they shared many of our secrets with China.
They did not do that for the black community in America 400 years we're still a minority the issue lights and we still have yet to get this white man and judgment for his sins against us and against the original inhabitants of this land
You got it wrong. Military chips does NOT require most advanced chip technology, even 28nm below will do.
Yeah but we have a valley full of the shit, or wait is it a valley full of shit, I’m not so sure!
Don’t underestimate Chinese,they are smart and work hard I’m sure they can make it even been cut off. Don’t forget that Taiwanese are Chinese either
What I need to correct you here is, Taiwan is a province of China, either Republic or People's Republic of China
You lied about many things in this video, Eg Russia didn't cut off the oil supply to Europe, your brilliant yet sleepy president did it, you know what i mean.
Excellent video, very informative. Easy to follow. Def Sub and like
Man, this video is soooo US centred that gives me nausea. Saying China's military as the center of the conflict is too naive. US spends more in military than everyone else, and bombed more countries than everyone else. The center point is US can't keep up the growth rate of China, and as spoiled kid gives sanctions after sanction. There is no such a thing as free market, it never had. That's why it keeps doing these sanctions, as it did to Japan in the past. These acts only show how US failed as a society. It loses to china in almost all metrics, and the chip act is a desperate measure, instead of looking at your homeland issues. Also, you know nothing about China. Taiwan IS part of China. Even US recognized that.
They are  Geopolitical fighting but Propaganda against MUSLIMS were tagged with Islamist Militants by Western Terrorist countries
Well done, Johnny......
I found extremely odd that asml is barely mention in the video. Asml, EUV fab machine maker, only use a small percentage of US tech but is crucial in chip making.  China doesnt need tsmc if they can buy the EUV machine from the Dutch to make the chip. And the key chip design software ARMs is UK based, not mention also. So no, US only holds a fraction of the global chip technology.
Such a good damn video!
Wasnt this facts for like 20 years now 😅 but yes be aware
Malaysia MH370 was high jacked for a new micro chip. Beijing didn't get it 👊
This is a great channel
...Implicit  war....explicit  war....
Sounds like everyone is gonna be drinking a liter of chips...
Fantastic! I work at one of these companies and it was so delightful to watch such a beautiful presentation of the work that my company is doing. You made me learn about my company much more than my company's onboarding videos did!
Wow how did you not mention USA's deal with the Netherlands in all of this?
Then yeah, you will definitly think about why the chips are mainly made from contries who located around china (Japen, Korean, Chinese Taiwan)? I bet after GSMC moving its most advanced product line to US, it will soon fade away like the Japanese Chip componies in the 1980's
Let us not forget that the United States of America is a stolen country. Since the foundation of the 13 colonies, they have never stopped fighting, and have killed the most humans in history. USA has been fighting wars for 230 years out of 246 years of its existence. The United States of America was created after committing genocide, that killed more than 90% of the Native population. Their nation's economy was built on the blood, sweat, and tears of black slaves. The United States of America survives on a war machine, called the US military-industrial complex. As long as the US thrives on war business, which is a cavemen mentality, there can never be peace and stability in this world.
Ur…. Military chip are usually so low end, they don’t need it run very fast, neither very small size, they just need it be reliable. China has made its own military chip long time ago, they are not competitive in market
And biologists saying that we are carbon based life... pfff
There is an obvious mistake in your video, Taiwan is not a country, Taiwan is a province of China
Unidentified group member of the KGB in Russia said she was watching the nightly radar activites and she had the same high altitude 10 thousand feet to almost ground level and witnesses were reported 16 silver objects there was two officers missing from base after a head count of the base .did they show back up or not? That's the one question that is important
US is too late, the cat is out of the bag and they will now be chasing the chinese; the tragedy is the republicans will no doubt reverse it
Plasma can become switches to a certain level and not so hot even colder than the usual
How do you build something that small?
You #missed  most important company in this video. The #Dutch company #ASML is only company in world making machines for manufacturing of advance chips. So #Netherland also has important role in this #ChipWar.
American corporations and the exploitation of cheap labour abroad have hurt the US's global power, its economy, its military, social harmony, and ultimately the well being of its people. When will Americans, especially right wing Americans, understand that free markets and prioritizing shareholder value will eventually destroy its country? The US needs more Bernie Sanders and less Donald Trump.
The west needs to go to war with China 🇨🇳 this as been coming for a long time now its going to happen let's get it over with. They have just threatened the USA 🇺🇸. Let's get in first they are ready to attack the west.
Hey 💕
Thank you.
OoohiiiiioOoOo....
@16:40 come on Johnny who's the artist/track??? 😢
Johnny Harris masterclass!
This is soo interesting we literally fighting to get ahead on technological advances wow 🤩
If china makes a boat blokade they can ship cargo trought cargo planes
Where does Russia get its semiconductors? Taiwan?
This has all been fairly OBVIOUS stuff most of the way through. We're not so stupid. It's also what has happened through the centuries as different empires based upon their contemporary technologies have evolved. From fire, through the metals, copper, bronze, iron, and then into steam, petrochemicals, and semiconductor tech.
Why say "quote reunite it" (Taiwan) as if it is a lie that Taiwan had been under China in the past.
WOW, great vlog.  I would note:  Reagan left presidency in 1989, so, when Japan stuff happened, it was also followed by Clinton administration to open trade with China.....and move industry to their land.
Actually, most of the microchips are made in Taiwan. With the lack of these microchips, it stalled the selling of new cars. Consumers waited months to get a new car. Due to these shortages.
Great explanation. CHEERS.
Imo its up USA fault and allso wester coutries that Chaina is so big now. And thats sad. "The capitalists will sell us the string with which we will hang them" - Lenin
What about India? I think everybody don't look at them right now. And don't forget, they just beat China by the number of population.
The thing is if china have shown their tech is way advance, it means they're not concern about USA cutting them off.
Best part is, China can't compete. They're running out of money and running our people. Sounds weird but they have a giant generational gap. China's economy will collapse in 10-15 years and Xi might be dead of old age by that time
China doesn't have a single soldier with any combat experience. So their military isn't scary at all
Instead of protecting them. Move Taiwan's production to us mainland. Make that land sovereign Taiwan land
General milley is such a weak general
It is very important for deaf community, it would be good to translate foreign language correctly too. I learned a lot from you.
The computer on the Apollo mission is as powerful as a calculator. Think about that
Anybody who thinks that globalization or interdependence are good things obviously has never heard of the bronze age collapse.
China's geographic location is their weakest link.  Most of their fresh water resources could be diverted fairly easily.  Try fighting a war while your people are revolting because they have no water for their crops.
A Chinese blockade of Taiwan would absolutely be considered an act of war. Also, the Chinese know they do not have the naval power to hold it against the US Navy.
So in the end usa shot its self in the foot for being to overly confident.
You should make a video on elon musk neurolink
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
“Oh.. oh.. wait“ interruptions are quite annoying. Content would be much better without it. Besides that, great work as usual.

Quantum computers is the one's  and zeros you can't see. Even the threes 4, 5 678 opposite of negative and positive making a cross numerativaly or religiously speaking
Taiwan is not a country. It’s part of China.
I watched your vlog about America and coups, seems like the US is ripe for a coup  yourself seems like your country is get more separated and disjointed be aware nothing is good and lasts forever. You made a lot of assumptions that the US has everything under control. After all wasn't it the Chinese who wrote the first book on warfare. The art of War
I wonder if the Taiwanese people are happy that the current Taiwanese gov are literally sending the crown jewels of their economy to the US.
Trump started the restrictions
No hate or anything, but I can tell you dont know a shit. You just read here and there in the internet as everyone can do this days. The problem with this is that you are not really an expert on what you are talking about and spreading ignorance, well done  . Yes the video are well done and have a good quality but this doensnt know you know whats up. Very sad
This is chilling….
Man I just wanna live bro

"Lucky for China there's a blurry line between business and military" This message brought to you by America's blurry line between business, government, and the military.
I was high watching this and it sobered me up. Really good video.
So American of you to give all credit of designing chips to American companies when they all buy their machines from ASML (formerly Phillips). "Magic chip machine" like you said is apparently what the Americans think of them haha no wonder China is winning lol
Do you need cobalt to make the silicon?
oh yeah tiwan is the world's largest chip maker, they have asml ultra violent etching machines that came from the Netherlands, China has Ben restricted from buying these machines that has the ability to print the size of a virus thousands of time tinier than a human hair,on a micro chip, and you can best bet they will reverse engineer it, guess who has their eyes on this machine ? oh yeah I suspect Russia has got a target on the Netherlands, because asml is the only company in the world that can make these machines
this guy gives more information in the shortest time so no waisted time
Johnny, won't the loss of all the revenue gained from sales of merchandise from China to the US discourage war?
I love your journalism! Keep it up! You are unbiased and focus on the facts. Bravo!
Pamela Anderson is too packed with silicone
Bring fab in North Carolina.
hello Johnny Harris, you are welcome to visit Taiwan to take a look. We are friendly to foreigner visitors.  and one more thing i want to mention about your video is.....   Besides the chips issue, just simply look at the map, USA can't afford to lose Taiwan and let China take away Taiwan.  the Map explains all.  in the past 10 years, China Navy kept growing fast, How come didn't you see their battle ships in the Pacific Ocean?
Very intelligent 👌🏾
Johnny this was by far the best video I have seen in awhile !
we make the experimentals here, then send them there for manufacturing. we do have fabs in usa.
Tf is that thumbnail💀💀💀😭😭😭😭
It used to be silicon but somehow it became sillakin. Hey, at least it's not silicone
This such amazing channel, thank you
Why would be 'scary' that Chine reunifies with Taiwan? They belong to the same country and you americans should know it.
Wrong again, the war is fought over currency to free themselves from debt. NOT semiconductors. To America, if they can strengthen their currency, they can purchase whatever they want from China at lower costs, but China has to spend more to trade from others to slow down China's overall progress. America doesn't care if China makes cheap semiconductors, they care if they're expensive semiconductors.  Replace the word semiconductors with anything and it's the same result.
Now Johnny needs to do an entire video on rear earth elements.
The subtitles are written as "FABS", as if its an acronym. Its just shorthand for "fabrication". As in microchip fabrication.
not only was nancy spouting her bull she was getting details to pass on to her drunk driving husband show he can sell millions of $ and then buy more but hey thats a free america but wait thats illegal and biden and norway blew up the nord stream pipeline that fucked his allies nice
I have been asking this question about what the heck is going on with semi-conductors for over a year and a half. You just put all the pieces together and elaborated more on the topic in 30 minutes. Thanks for this one, thanks for making it make sense.
One thing the U.S. has an abundance of that no one can match is....... ignorance and greed..... It's done an excellent job of creating a society full of greedy ignorant people. Yay! Good job!
The vibes in your videos are really relaxing, Sometimes I just sleep watching those skinny theme videos. Amazing work mate!!!
Brilliant!
This is why Republicans that Call Biden "Beijin Biden" make no sense. Sleepy joe is fucking up China right now.
Should have gone into packaging and EUV machines. It would explain why we can't just move everything or copy Taiwan TSMC. It would take the U.S A lot of Investments and years to get where Taiwan is right now.
Too late
Your story telling in semiconductor are misdirection, you have no idea, the struggle of the physicist to make it work....
Wow business and government working together in a communist country... never thought that would happen
Hi I'm not nick but my gamer tag is HB
Chinese authorities have no qualms with America and they will develop what they need without American inputs  America is dependent on Chinese innovations  America is stealing TSMC from Taiwan and China will let Americans take the eggshell only  America is stealing an empty building that will end up useless in the near future  All those Chinese workers from TSMC will not let America steal their hard earned technology
TSMC's founder/CEO didn't want to setup a factory to USA. But TSMC faced lots pressure from both US and Taiwan's president and finally gave in. TSMC is only about 200 miles from China's grip. They can get it if they really wanted.
One thing missed here is chips used for military does not have to be the most or even advanced ones.
Move all of the fucking  semiconductor bullshit somwhere else other than Taiwan.
*I was kind of waiting for you to joke about, "Let me go get them silicone breast implants too!*

china is good at math and science... who knew?
What if the chip itself is a whole transistor ?
Great video. Thank you  for helping me to have a clearer understanding of this important issue. God bless you.
Johnny how do you think China will respond to this? Would they use their dominance of rare earth minerals trade to fight back?
Absolutely brilliant.
Chip count : 412
Come to Arizona, specifically the corner of I-17 and the Carefree highway. Huge new micro chip factory in the desert. Looks like a new city.
This is only one facet of 5th generation warfare.

Please tell me good news
seriously when can i buy an mid to high end RTX for a reasonable price Again? I am gonna kill myself if my HD7780 is gonna fail and oh yes it will
It’s so funny how now we want to bring everything back inside the 🇺🇸.. hilarious..
Any time I hear the word "hack" I know shit is being pitched.
excellent researching on the subject. 💯
buy yet  the resoureces  needed to make chips   china has lmao biden suppoter
Should have NEVER relied on foreign countries.
Microchips got it
America should never have allowed businesses to send these things over there in the first place. We know that they reverse engineer our stuff and then build cheaper knock offs. It's the basis of their economy. Another thing that people don't think about is the fact that they send their brightest students to America to learn our technology in our universities, then they go back home and use all the cutting edge stuff they learned here to gain more ground in this 'luke warm war'. Corporations need to be held accountable for this. Their greed in wanting to have a market 3-4x bigger than the US economy made them willing to sell their own country out.
Which war? We don‘t fight against each other. Fool other people!! 🖕
ASML.
1:50 HI, I'M NICK!
Looks like Donald Trump wasnt as bad as libs would acknowledge. Biden has literally kept the same policy.
Isn't this what Trump was talking about an stopped it. But Biden start back up
Fantastic and informative video!
This transistor talk gives me ptsd from ATT in the navy training as a firecontrolman
Awesome Content!
To much overacted.
You forgot to mention that Taiwan is officially not a country, but a province of China. It has no representation in the United Nations and it's only recognized as a country by a handful of countries.

Johnny thanks for making it simple and clear for a guy like me to understand. We should all be paying attention to the story behind the stories. 🙏🇺🇸🙏🌎🙏
https://youtu.be/WDfJn1kcQuU
War will not bring us peaceful world, do not worry about China, China does not start the war in the history and believe is not their strategy, just work together to build cheaper chips, cheaper source then can fight for inflation since everything need chips. Too much of worry will bring tension and easily made wrong decisions. Hope good human can build the world better.
Let me explain what will happen. China is a huge market. Other players will sell chips to China. It will take a decade or two, but they will find new sellers.
China will clearly lose. They are too dependent on imports and exports unlike the USA. Russia or the Soviet Union wasn't dependent on other nations. They were an energy and food exporter. China isn't. So China can't survive in its current form without globalism.
Super sonic missiles are overhyped. Why would you take a press release as a source? They just want to make you afraid. Super sonic missiles create a lot of heat. Heat radiates. So they are trackable. Missiles are in general hard to stop. You have to catch them at the start. Once they fall, they are unstoppable (not just super sonic missiles).
I really don't care about chips in my fridge or in my toothbrush. These are low end chips. I'm interested in high-end chips.
Wearing a hat in a flat. Cmon take some criticism
Why was the Chandler, AZ Intel plant building a 5th Fab in like 2009 if all the Fabs are in Taiwan?
Fake conflict you mean since intel own locations in every major country this doesn't even make sense
As an Electrical Engineer I understand all these dynamics. But honestly American companies in this tech sector need to hire American engineers to do the jobs and keep America ahead. You cannot turn your back on your own engineers and expect your friendenemies to move you ahead. Common sense should guide tech leaders and decision makers!
China can never win because they don't let there people think ore be free.  If they let this happen then watch out
Hope for world peace! All people can be respected and loved. I'm Chinese.
Technically trump first attempted to ban China from microchips. But because he is republican it was heavily delayed. As soon as Biden got voted in, the democrats in the senate stopped blocking necessary laws.
Why USA defense Huawei? talking spyware that's ridiculous..
Don't forget about ASML

New subscriber ! I’m definitely rocking with y’all content man keep it up!
In jew politics ?
I've seen a lot of weird things on this channel, but being surprised that Reagan did a bad thing has got to be the weirdest so far
Cause Biden running through all the chips we need all the chips we got and can get
Ur content is good. Very informative but u also keep it interesting 👍🏼🙏🏼
fantastic
Love your videos🇨🇦
most interesting channel on youtube no 🧢
Nicely explained whole things, Thanks brother 👍
Seriously to me this is the best storytelling and video quality I've seen on YouTube. I keep getting stuck on his videos all the time
China does not only buy chips for military, in fact most of the chips were assembled with your PC, smartphones, etc. And sold back to the world. And you didn’t  talk about how China managing to catch up the advanced chip manufacturing these years.
Why Taiwan is so important to the US.  Not just chips. please do more study. Please go back to history. When Japan want to rule China and killed more than 10 millons people in china. You will know why china wants to get Strong. Why does japan want to rule china. Because Japan knows if I am not ruling china one day the US will rule me.
Morris Chang said to Pelosi :You Americans are naive. You think you can just move a whole factory there from Taiwan?
You have gained a new fan yo
Come on rabbit and tortoise
You apparently didn’t like Pres Ronald Reagan for taxing Japan’s semiconductor industry. Why? Did the U.S. understand as much about semiconductors then as we do now to include their implications? Or was the U.S. purposely trying to stagnate Japan in order for the U.S. to buy time to catch up in creating semiconductors?
The lack of talk about ASML in this video is disturbing.
Silicon is even in my girlfriend
Not accurance on the hypersonic missiles. They are trackable and they don't fly hypersonic. "Not What you Think got it right". Otherwise great show
The fact that powerful nations are banning together to try and dethrone to United States reserve currency and Petro dollar status means the war really has begun. Let's just hope WW3 is Nuke free, best we can hope for. Wish he would have explained how the element silicone was discovered. It was accidental during a space mission experiment that was looking at earth through a special telescope prism hot and cold gas in front of the prism or behind it. Can't remember the name of the method for detection of elements.
ww3?
Haha , chips is not magic, America is shooting themselves in the foot. Trade protectionism is not good for any country.  Americans may produce the most advanced chips but they got no customer 🤣. Sooner or later China will produce their own chips. Look what happened to the space station. America banned  China from it. China developed their own space station. It might take time but sooner or later they will do it .Just like the chip industries. 🤣🤣 Who is America going to sell their most advanced chips to  ,🤣
Yo idk how you get the views of respect you have on yt. You’re just smoke and mirrors
You can't tell me the train derailment in Ohio doesn't have to do with the new chip factory.
IT ALL MAN MADE  ! HOPE A BIG ASTROLITE TO HITE THE EARTH ! 🌎 ENDING EVIL HUMANKIND !
Do you really think Biden plays a part in the discussion on the chip global supply chain?  Lol no.
Maybe it is only me I found this simple video only brushed surface of the current chips war  but failed to talked about the implications and aftermath to the global supply chain due to the chips act. We know China is already capable to make 7nm chips which is not the most advanced but good enough to power almost everything except the latest iPhone. Also we are approaching the dead end of advancement of silicon based computer chips due to physics limitations, and it is increasingly difficult to improve the existing chips design. As ASML CEO said once China will catch up, it is matter of time, then what? Don’t forget how China is catching the car industry.
FYI military chips not necessarily need to be advanced. In fact 90% most advanced chips are used for playing games and mine Bitcoins. A chip used in the washing machines are sufficient to guide an ICBM missile.
In this whole scenario Indian will come on top as India is planing to make its own chip industry in fact India has already started its efforts
US loves free market till it works in their favour … if free market works for others then it becomes economic war  … story of double standards
Welcome to WWIII
Fun to see a libs brain explode when they realize bad guys do bad things
Kind of ironic when you consider the flight MH370 had some big microchip players onboard
Whomever has Taiwan controls the world
quite off on alot of this information, you should really take a second look at this
Man that was one of the coolest videos I’ve ever seen. This reminds me of a more in-depth National Geographic explorer.
USA is probably wishing it was competing with Japan instead of China right about now.

There is no war between countries. Governments are controlled by the elite.
This Fxcking video man🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
6:39, i dont think thaats a circuit thats smth else
start it now!!🤣👍
So did you do International Relations as a course in University?
Everything is great, until you have to say Taiwan is a country.   Really have to stick with facts.
"Biden rolls up his sleeves and.." na bro more like Biden sits in a room nodding sayin "ok and what do i do next"
the selling of all that stuff to china was also the ONLY reason they could not attack taiwan, if they basicly are cut of anyways ... why not swallow taiwan ? get all teh chips back ur cut of from ... jaeh this might "seem" smart but they put china in a corner where the most logical way out is "fast strike vs taiwan" before usa can react u need to already have soldiers on the ground and then jaeh u get 30 years of sanctions they dont care they cut of anways ... usa can say alot but if china is already on the ground in taiwan what they wanna do ? start an invasion of china ? gl that will cost millions of soldiers ... and usa dont wanna start the nuke war so the second china gets a foot into taiwan ... its theirs
The political background you share is just a theoretical aspect. In effect, the U.S. government positions itself as God, the creator and destroyer of other nations. Everyone must abide by the rules it sets, otherwise it will be punished or even overturned Except that the U.S. government has the supreme power including U.S. dollar military and technology, and these privileges owned by the United States do not allow other countries to surpass. Looking at other small countries in the past like Venezuela, How countries such as Iraq, Syria and Libya, Yugoslavia and now Russia are treated by the United States and its allies. And now the tension with China is even more exacerbated by the fact that the Chinese government advocates China's great revival and promoting the Belt and Road initiative helps  to revitalise the countries worldwidely, which threatens US hegemony. interests, intensifying the bottomless smearing and suppression of China with allies... All of these are not only political ideology, it may be only a small part, but more of the core interests of the giant capitalists and political parties sitting behind have been touched. There is a Chinese proverb: "Listen to his words, first watch his deeds."
I don't know if US could win. China biggest advantage is that they're a rich socialist communist countries that only have one head and always have one fully focused mind on doing something. If they decided to do something they always finishes it. Just look at the three gorges dam. unlike America where even making a jet took them decades and trillions of dollar to finish it. America's mind was in shambles, always had, because of the two party system. The only reason they're big now because they won big in WW II. Other than that they're losing everywhere and every time. Based on history alone I would put my money on China instead America anytime.
This is my stuff
Okay mr. Smarty you know you took our previous president comment out of contacts, that's right he shut down Japan to give us a better opportunity to exceed at the technology, what you have mentioned earlier silicon valley and shutdown foreign markets for the benefit of the American people, Ronald Reagan did not believe in a one world organism, he only believed in the benefit of his own individual country the United States, so for you to slander Ronald Reagan maybe because your own political views I really don't care that is your right, and thank God for the Constitution because that is your right get it
I don't think you understand the issue between gas from Russia to Europe... That Nord pipeline .. who blew it up... Hmm
Hey , Just wanted to leave a comment to tell you I just discovered your channel and I cant believe how interesting it is. Top quality content ,you get me hooked up from start to finish.
You’re so greedy with ads
They didn’t put a self destruct button in the chips??? Big fail
Imagine a world where humans work together instead of against
Great Insight thanks for the explanation on everything and your Insight
The war that's going on now in Ukraine and probably another in the Pacific soon.. this is a war to challenge American control over the world. Russia and China are determined to not allow USA continue being the world 'government' and america does not want to relinquish it's hold. In my opinion it's always better to have a multipolar world rather than a not..
Well done holy man, I’m now understanding why I didnt know what. 🖤🫡
Good cut them off. Shouldn't be selling out to our freaking enemies in the first place.
.. And before those ones Olivetti!!!
there a kerfinkle to the fuckle tho in this fukery...trade deal with mexico
what a good news channel
The reason China wants to invade Taiwan is a long history. But it begins back during the revolution, the nationalist government fled mainland China and set up in Taiwan. It isn't a good guy/bad guy story here. Both sides have a very checkered past.
Imagine if humans could just advance technology without a geopolitical handicap..🌎
Sweden will win
What is the name of music at 2.30?
Trump started the "trade war" with China and boy he was right. US will go all out war for Taiwan if they need to that is why China is still not invading Taiwan until now.  So China is enforcing their 9-line with a hidden agenda. i never thought that something else aside from oil would be war worthy.
what a coincidence i'm doing semiconductors question now
Kinda funny how i already found this issue with china 15 years ago... but took america until now to figure out something so basic... china has been at trade and property theft for the last 30 years.. most of the tech they have stolen.. It's funny to see tesla copies in china. Yes, they are identical, even the frame, etc... and then tesla wants  to sell them more cars... they just steal your shit and rename the product... nothing new classical Chinese  culture  and behaviour. How did the west not see this coming....
Anyone notice that two of the several toxic spill events have happened recently, were within less than 200 miles of these new chip facilities from Intel and TSMC? No tin foil hat here but thats a little coincidental, almost like someones letting you know they can get to you if they wanted.
US companies for profit, provides the enemy with chips for military use = OK. Julian Assange posts war crimes = traitor.  Lrts go BbbbbBrandon.
I work at a major semiconductor facility, like major. If you want any inside information on this, I have plenty of JUICY details. Especially about China.
Terminator is telling us the future
From what I understand is that the government (s) fear is losing technology. Without technology these world leaders are nothing. No power. No control. No protection. Etc.
“Reese’s peanut butter cup from Trader Joe’s” 😭😭
Ah yes, America want to give China, Stuxnet virus.
Chips chips chips what about the neon gas that’s needed to cut chips. Now you can answer the question why did Russia invade Ukraine. Its because Ukraine houses 80% of the world neon gas. WW3 will be based on chip control.
wuts up nick
He seems to be having the best time of his life because USA is losing
Atleast someone can make out what biden says
Love these videos. Just subbed and excited for the next one.
Just discovered your channel. Good stuff man. You do an amazing job look forward to more videos.
Big thanks ❤️
China will surpass the US and Taiwan in chip production
This video was good except at one point when there was a xylophone overload.
The Chinese spy balloon is starting to make sense now
Jonny click fingers (always leaves mass info off)
Putin is not cutting gas to Europe. Europe just does not want to take it anymore.  Like you said. economic war. check the                                            "BRICS" and u will understand meer
The only good thing sleepy joe ever did
Can't wait to see how this Semiconductor war goes!!!
this is a big  slap for china for no longer access on rhyt and lockheed..once this happen.
That's what we get for making others do everything now we don't know how to do it ourselves and now we have to take care of them for the rest of time
I was born in the late sixties you guys may have a problem with losing your chips but I have no problem they killed off most of the old people with this coronavirus to make things work better BS statistically if there was something going on I'd be going back to work and you guys be going back to school
$400 million drop us chip stock vs spending billions if not trillions in warfare with a now advanced China. $400 million is  pocket change
This channel is next level. Dudes a genius
I heard when the people came to the United Snake's with the idea the United Snake's told them to roll out so they went over seas and they expected them once the United Snake's found out what it was all about it was to late now look we are in a war now for the chip but it's to late
If China is Cell, then Taiwan is sorta like Android 18. China wants to absorb TW so to become the perfect Cell.
Taiwan is a bad counter move. In order to best case scenario the situation they’d have to surprise attack so hard that none of the scientists or engineers escape. Because in my mind there’s a 100% chance that upon invasion those fans self destruct to prevent china from using them. If they don’t for some reason there is a 200% a fleet of b2 show up and blow the shit out of them. If any significant number of scientists and engineers are able to flee in the invasion (it’s almost certain they would) they would be able help the US set up the sophisticated fabs in the US. This is why china has tried to interfere in Taiwanese politics and sentiment the only way for them to take Taiwan without losing it most valuable assets is with an open hand.
White dudes: 3 - 5" Black dudes: 🐴 " Latin dudes: 🌮" Asian dudes: 🐌"
Chinese men.... The 🐓 that you can't see....
TSMC what are the odds that WW3 starts to keep this world leading foundry out of Xi Jin Ping's grasping paws? Also it's interesting to see how big business doesn't give a sh*t about loyalty, not if it gets in the way of their profit margins. Governments need to reign in these greedy traitors, before they give our enemies the means to defeat us. Then you look at the politicians, people like Nancy Pelosi, and ask yourself is she more interested in lining her own pockets or making the USA and the West strong enough to be unchallenged by their enemies? Ummm between the greedy corporations and the greedy politicians I think we're up  💩 creek without a canoe,  🛶 nevermind a paddle.
I am a Taiwaness, people who lives in Taiwan should watch this.
It’s all well and Good Until Skynet takes over the Earth and Ai turns on us All🙈 Either way I ate A lot of Friendly Chips last night covered in Heinz Tomato Ketchup and I was the Only one Being Aggressive😜
Switzerland is actually known for producing some of the high-precision machinery the FABs require, like "Die Casting Machines."
Geopolitics definitely hurt some semiconductor hardware suppliers, I read one of the largest etch producing hardware suppliers just laid off a ton of workers
Stop with the BS, Taiwan is a part of China, all but five countries acknowledge this, including the US and Taiwan. The KMT (opposition) is pro unification, and in a recent, what you would call "midterm" elections, the KMT won 17 of the 23 districts, and are predicted to win the next general election. More than half the population see themselves as "Chinese" and on any given day, there are more than a million Taiwanese residents working and or living on the mainland. The whole conflict, war propaganda is about the very thing your talking about, chips, but you can't put the two together. It's about power and money. The U.S.A. don't want to give up their hegemony.
the 1st ship the Chinese stopped from getting to Taiwan, would also be the last;. A blockade would not work. It would be the button to start firing real shots. Not sure your opinion is realistic at times
The United , states is screwed. With this administration.
This about made my heart stop. And all I want is a new graphics card damn........ War ruins everything.
sponsor doesn't know ChatGPT is here.... IT guys and coders are OUT of the game they know that...  see ya @Mcdonnalds
hahaha you are a rich leftist ahahha
Thanks for confirming my thoughts all along  ... I knew there was no justifiable reason for Nancy pelosi to end up in Taiwan other than financial game for herself and to get the Fab knowledge and engineers to the United States to help us build out our own!
Great video, although I recently watched a Chris Williamson podcast and his guest, Peter Zeihan, counters your claim by predicting that China will inevitably collapse within the next 20 years...    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRT7P-VKM0k
Absolutely genius presentation. Simple yet effective at putting facts straight. Just love this kindoff content ❤
and the uk designs and authorises the  use of their patent.
That is because the world does not want to indirectly provide the US money to provide the security to allow globalization.  And China started saber rattling.
The US  is theft and they not that advance like they say still rely on Asian to survive sad......!!!!!!!!
I'm China I cut off rare earth materials to the US period and control 90% of rare minerals......!!!!!!!! The US don't have the process industries......!!!!!!!! China have everything. China make 7mn and design thier chips and going to 3nm now China call the way.....!!!!!!
Big new chip plant in Ohio... is there any connection between the chips and that chemical catastrophe that's after just happening after the train derailled?
I don’t believe that the US doesn’t have hypersonic missiles and I’m iffy about the idea that they have no way of intercepting them, why on Earth would they mention that publicly if they didn’t? Or maybe it’s a double bluff, they really don’t have the tech and are trying to make it seem like they do to China, because why would they say that if they truly didn’t?   “Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak” - China’s very own, Sun Tzu
Gr1000 video :)
biais biais
Fun fact: From a Chinese perspective Taiwan is as much a breakaway separatist region, as Crimea is from an Ukrainian perspective and the autonomy of both regions is not recognized by the UN.
gtg buy some micron shares now
I have said it time and time again and it seems only now can people see the reality of what I was labeled "crazy" for saying. THE COLD WAR NEVER ENDED!
Can’t see much when you’re looking through glasses made in China.
Very well done thank you
Who are the chip companies selling to if not China, the biggest buyer??? They will go bankrupt!
Germanu
He just does not know that Silicon is not a metal
Oh wow, that explains why ohio is building a giant chip factory, leading to Ibew union Jobs. Real shit.
Johnny Harris is a fed propagandist spreading Frankfurt style leftist critique that defangs any real leftist progress or thought and subverts leftist progress for the betterment of western imperialism.
Johnny: "tiny pieces of metal that are magic and run out world" me, an intellectual: "actually they're semiconductors not metals" 🤓
What? This is some of the stupidest propaganda and lazy reporting on the issue. Chinese hypersonic missiles don't use any american micro chips. In fact, their missiles have nothing to do with the chip conflict. All Chinese military chips are produced in-house by the PLA and are much bigger than the nano-sized chips used for phones. What makes Chinese missiles ahead of american missiles are not chips, but aerodynamics and wind tunnels.   Wind tunnels allow China to create simulation of high altitude environment in order to test and iterate the aerodynamics of their missiles at a very low cost. The wind tunnels require infrastructure prowess to build. This is why China is way ahead of america. USA doesn't have advanced wind tunnels like China has. The only way to test and gather real data for their missiles is by firing a real missile or prototype in the atmosphere, which takes a lot of time and huge costs.  The reason why usa is cutting China off from the chips supply is because this is the area of tech that usa has the highest chance to win in the competition, whereas China is already winning on a lot of other things, such as infrastructure engineering, telecommunication, EV, etc. The chip blockade is usa's last chance to keep China from surpassing.
Silicon is in your simcard and chip and pin.
This is Americas fault. There so fykking greedy that they ship it around the world to be done cheaper. Now dumb azz america forgot how to make them. Losers! America needs to stop educating other people that aren't from america, otherwise this ish will continue to happen. But this will never happen because america allows open boarder not thinking (because they never think) this will bite them in the azz!
This guy really has a chip on his shoulder.. love him to death..
I'm just being honest, the way you "ramble" is straight up lifted from hank green
Cheap US policy as always
It's too late! Even if the US banned any 3nm to 5nm chips to Chinese companies, the US would not be able to stop China from making weapons. Because China already has the industrial technology of 7nm to 28nm chips. Weapons don't require microchips, except for iphones and ipads. If China wants to put microchips in weapons, they can remove them from iphones. Is APPLE pulling out of the Chinese market?
New subscriber, really informative, enjoyable and digestible content. I feel I’ve learned something new today! Keep up the good work, and thanks
Every ARM chip in the world is licensed from a British company of the same name. That's a crucial part of your supply chain that you missed. It's wrong to say the US has the best design when every mobile device out there is based on a British design.
YOU ARE AWESOME!!!!!!!
VOX posted a similar video on this subject, literally falling asleep at their quality. They need you back, man!
Dude your simple explanation of why a transistor makes a computer work just blew my mind
Cold war 2.0
your ignorance is like a clown
Top video , but the silicone is made from sand I think so it's not a metal.
Good stuff! I can see a lot of effort put into the research. The only missing piece is the status of China's own chip industry. They can already manufacture not so advanced chips almost all by themselves and try very hard for a technological breakthrough for those more advanced ones. It will be interesting to see how this will unfold in the years to come.
Silicon based lifeforms are real ftr
These chips are just crazy part of our life we can't even imagine the life without
How's that Brandon doing now, red cap snowflakes? That's your president.
Don't lie, you didn't regret that pun. Lol
No oil. No chips.
But the thing is they already have the designs and used the softwere. Yea, they are cut but they know how magic is made. China beat US on the sage of their own product, but that also means their microprograming is top notch and thay they know  their magic silicon pieces well. So they know and understand the design. fabs might be a problem but they have the economy to build those. The magic leaser beams? A few for reverse engineering would be ebough and they are all set. It's scary and crazy.

What about Google and Microsoft competing for search engine supremacy !!! Definitely make content on it ⚡
greed is the downfall of all
It seems that there are no much wise strategists in the West. It is unbelievable that such a stupid strategy has been adopted.
The nm nomenclature is just marketing really. No part of the "2nm chip" is 2nm.
whats lacking from this is AI development.  AI seems to be developing exponentially. If the USA monopolises development there and AI becomes the game changer it seems it will be, China is essentially doomed.   One way out of that is to reset the game, like flipping the table on a losing game of chess.  Bomb Taiwan back to the stone age and take out 92% of the worlds chip production. As in "if I cant win, nobody can"   That would be WWIII, but if its a winner take all situation, why wouldnt they do that? Serious question.
did trump already know usa  could defeat china in combat? did he know it would be a terible idea to start a war w usa?
12:08 *China never said they will or wanted to invade Taiwan. They have always insisted on a Peaceful Reunification.*
It’s more like US domination. But that soon will change in a few years.  China is about to disrupt the industry with new and better technologies. First they will dominate the older chips (14 nn or higher). Older chips are used in more than 90% of all products
Greedy Americans.. who would’ve thunk 💡 come on guys there’s more to life than how much is in the bank Acct that can vanish in a… ✌🏼
You are forgetting a important player in the chip chain line ASML
New to the channel. Love your content. Extremely well done 👏 thank you
Hi Nick at 1:51
@johnnyharris, help me solve something. Were micro chips used as a covid vaccine as a liquid chip? I kind of believe that nonsense as a next generation future thing. Sapien deus was mythology or vision for something bigger than that. Otherwise, technology goes faster than a human brain can handle.
I have been studying semiconductor lessons in electrical circuits During a full semester course , and none of my teachers mentioned their use in the creation of silicone chips and how amazingly important they are , they only talked about how do we use them to amplify  voltage ....after watching this video I feel a wave of mixed sensations that are hard to describe, disappointment at not knowing this before, mixed with excitement and amazement.
I hate how the US is purposely slowing the world microchip development to stay above
I am a citizen in Taiwan, and the biggest problem in Taiwan right now is that there are too many CCP collaborators, and it's becoming a serious national security issue.
You do a really good job at showing us how existential a threat this is for all of us, and that we ourselves created it. Here’s cheers to our dystopian future 🍻
that's why it's called Silicon Valley.... 🤯
America Empire will Fall Just hope it fall with wrong people and not everyone and society that trying do right for the world.
Thank you for this wonderful story Johnny.
Morris Chan was not a Taiwanese returnee, he was actually born in China.
Fish and chips.
Not intending to argue with the video here regarding chips & economics, but I don't believe in military cause of all this.  1)Military is about weapons, yes, but cutting edge technology doesn't necessarily mean significant chances change in terms of winning, it's just silent threat. Mutual destruction isn't the goal, so what rocket can do? Blow up some economically/military vital structures or supplies. So why you do you rocket for that if you can have bureaucracy instead.  2)Lesser chips means more calculations per Watt. Instead of having more calculations, you can optimize your math and algorithms that you do on them enough for your purposes.  3)Lesser chips don't make much sense in military because chips below 65nm are more susceptible to radiation and environmental pressure, which I'm sure rocket experiences a lot. It's not intended use. Spacecraft microwave at most to be energy efficient. I.e you need chips for that, but you don't need cutting edge.   It's consumer market war, may be some corruption, power rearrangement, but that's about it.
If China would invade Taiwan,I feel Taiwan may be forced by USA to destroy the fabs and move the specialists to the new tmsc fabs in America
This is a seriously impressive video.
Can't wait to see the Chinese burn
Can you provide?   Soon as possible   US of America   New Relationship Country   Japan Taiwan  Thailand  Laos Nepal India Singapore   Now to 2032   Make new Product of Chip Items  Companies   Languages Japanese  USA American English  Taiwanese  Thai Lao Nepali  Hindi Malay   In Development new High Quality Chip Products for USA and World   Based on Technology Products Inspired by Japan World for USA grow from
I retired from a communications job where I worked with fiber optic,microwave and satellite communications. I started out in electronics working in a TV repair shop at 16 yo in 1969. I did a four year enlistment in the military in avionics and they taught us both tubes and semiconductors. It is amazing the changes I have seen over 50 years. Huge pieces of electronics that took up a whole rack have been reduced to a few rack spaces.
These videos are enlightening and interesting.
You should make a video about Alexei Navalny
Brah your videos are gold standard! So easy to understand politics with you.
Taiwan not a country it's part of China
Just like any market if you make it illegal you just create a black market and give people a way to make millions in the dark . If they want the chips they will get them .
Like they can’t get the chips. It’s just like drugs . Make it illegal now someone else will sell them to them
love you man❤
Newsflash: Economic dependencies have newer worked as a deterrent for war. To believe that globalization would stop this just look at the first era of globalization that ended with World War One.   Also in eras when globalization was in decline like before World War two. Germany's two greatest trading partners in 39 were France and Sovjet.  Now stop spreading the lie that globalization is good and read some Marxism.
Fun fact, tsmc's concept of pure fab was considered a joke when Morris Chang pitch it in the IT industry back in the late 80s. Took tsmc decades to where it is now. Guess who's laughing now....
Not sure if I missed this, but why doesn't China just make those chips by themselves...? They are resource-abundant, have the technology and the organic talent pool for them to set up these fabs to do it themselves. Why not?
This how western pirates logic works. They praise how good the free market and free trade are when they are sure that they will win; But when they think they will lose, they discard the things they once praised as their shoes.
Man you western people are so biased about China always painting it as Evil 😂  on the other hand Democracies drop nuclear bombs and they are still democracies... killing millions of Innocent people in Middle east, Vietnam , Africa, Indian Subcontinent...  Seems like you people are really afraid of China right now...
Agressive china will drop bombs like Democratic USA
The reason china got the technology is because of those traitors Zongchang Yu , Song Lan and Wanyu Li who worked at ASML, a chip company in the US/Netherlands. The US government was looking to arrest Zongchang in silicon valley, but he already fled to china as he was coerced into moving to china to start a new company. I wouldn't put it passed the CCP to have planned this for a very long time. I hope he gets dealt with properly.
Gotta love US rhetoric like it's some type of 1vs1 death match. The US hardly gets any mentions in Chinese media. 300 year old country acting like it rules the world when historically every hegemon only lasted 100-500 years, of which China has been multiple times. Get over yourself USA.  If you wanna talk about intellectual property rights how much in reparations does the US owe China for inventing paper, gun powder, the compass, noodles, pizza, etc? 😂
What will happen to us if the poles flipped
Sounds to me like a Cold War 2.0
Surprised you mentioned all these other companies in the history of computing and microchips/semiconductors… and Intel doesn’t get a mention here (although Robert Noyce does)
Hey Johnny, I don't know whether you will read this comment or not, but I am also a student of International Relations and want to learn video editing like you. What can I do in this regard? Kindly help me out
This looks like WW3 :)) Just a matter of time.. as without Netherlands China won´t be able to make/get new (micro)chips as just few days ago "Netherlands and Japan Said to Join U.S. in Curbing China’s Access to Chip Tech"
Me as a British person looking at my potator suspiciously
Really cool stuff... Thanks
Thank you for another great video brotherI enjoyed every second. Please keep it coming.
feeling is like this episode is a little bit ideological 🤭
I always thought it was called silicon Valley because of breast implants! I guess it would have been called silicon hills instead ha-ha
Thanks for the video 👍👍👍
This could get even hairier than the original chip war between Cheetos and Doritos! #orangefingers
The blockade creates a second, this time chinese, silicon valley, but 10 times larger. Good luck US!
I like chips in my sandwich. It’s a new thing for me, and I dig it. Seriously though, great content man!
This guy needs his own show on TV
Nick just stood there, looking at you as if you had just walked in, kicked his poodle; then began walking out! L0L   Man I Love Your Vids Sir!!
According to the logic, if chips help build missiles, Taiwan should look into building most powerful missiles than any countries in the world.
Why u bitin my style with the long hair and gray beanie
Needs to update this with the Chinese spy balloon! Thats where we're at now
This is like comically similar to how the war starts in the Star Wars prequels
Pelosi went to Taiwan to indirectly threaten Taiwan not to work with China. Mean sell a false narrative on media that they need to be in Taiwan to protect them from China
Good for China for catching up with  chip industry by  building themselves strong enough enabling them to defend and protect their country.
Would chips explain the Chinese spy balloons too?
So much vocal fry.
More than $380 billion trade deficit to China, absolutely dumb. "They will sell you anything including the rope which will later to hang them.
Is not just the chips that's needed, don't forget all super sophisticated R&D tools needed to develop firmware for those new hiend processors. Without those tools a chip is just a piece of usless silicon. And I don't mean freeware compilers for cheap microcontrollers or windows C++ tools.
I actually spoke to a team that was coming in from Taiwan to help with the fab in Arizona. Really awesome collaboration on that stuff.
The American's sanctions on China by denying the high end silicon microchips (of <7nM nodes) to China will force the Chinese to seek alternative solutions such as by  using photonic chips, RISC-V chip  architecture, Harmony OS, etc. Chinese are talented people and will find a way out, especially when they are persecuted, thanks to the USA. 真金不怕 紅爐火 真金不怕红炉火 (Real gold is not afraid of the hot furnace fire).
What do you use for music? I love the 17 min section!
I don't think your electric kettle has silicon in it. You might assume because it auto shuts down it must have some chip to control it, but no, it only has this thing called a bimetallic strip, which deforms in hot vapor to cut off the power, no chip needed. Ingenious design.
intel: cant even make chips in ohio💀💀💀
Does Vox copy your work on the war of microchips? They have similar video to
its to late they blocked china from US Tec aboout 20 years to late they now have the ability to make their own tec that is needed to make chips from scratch ...
they could of told me this instead of making a pretend virus to scare us all ,and crush china
so if they sprayed somthing on us with in the air ,and we breathed it in they could put tracker in us then ,or little on of switches ,,,the conspiracy people was right🤔
I’m about to invest heavily in the dip market.
😆 this is amazing
I enjoyed watching very informative.
And then the balloons
oil embargo on japan led to pearl harbour. microchip lead to china taiwan us east asia war? please no! please no war.
HTV2a & b program. Look it up
Scaring Taiwan into working for us as opposed to against us is both upsetting and impressive. It makes me thankful we have the opportunity to turn countries around like that, but heartbroken that it takes a financially beneficial deal to do so.
Some claim all this is possible because of the Roswell crash and the technology they took from it
If anyone thinks that rats are the only thing that the mad scientist are experimenting on with this then younare sadly mistaken..
the usa is  far away from being the good guy!
Masterpiece♥️
Love your videos.
BLM BLM BLM BLM BLM BLM BML MLB
the ultimate "chip" pun would have been Johnny eating a bag of semi-conductors with chop sticks
In the style of Casey Nystat
First of all, Biden isn’t rolling up his sleeves, he opened the door for the Chinese! U seem to forget he repealed the china initiative so the they can come steal our tech freely! Oh yea pudding brain and his dopey son get rich in the process. Open ur eyes people!!!!!!!
Hold up did he post this before the spy balloon?
The micro chip so small that it is used for technology upgrades in many field's but during the process of this technology the government was not smart enough to use it on satellites around this planet for the ultimate advancement of smaller Signal's that convergence in the same process of optical strand's of signals for communication hidden by signals registered as nothing until the lowest sounds are amplified by RF frequency reflection of light distortion of color from the color blind program. I hope I get deported to a smarter country soon, I thought China was smart but that's why the US and China best friends of too many Drugs.
Money, money, money it's a billionaires world. Meanwhile.... I was thinking... There's a chance.... I should take it... C'mon let's shake it
so basically, the US is the reason China are pissed. Because greedy Americans sold intel and chips to China and thought yes get more money...to hell with the consequences!
This war has been going on for quite some time. Perhaps after 2000. It's not just limited over microchips either.
Great work man! You need your own Netflix section.
He says China's missile flies under the radar, but if satellites can see if my shoe's untied, how can anything get past them?
And now cobalt (I think that’s what used for the ev vehicle batteries) will be next to surpass oil.
Its not a "Reese's Peanut Butter Cup" if you bought it from Trader Joe's.
This is not good for the industry unless US is willing to subsidize continuously.   The industry's major players will be slowing down without China's market.    At the same time,   US is also forcing China's government to accelerate developing advanced semiconductor technologies.      I think the main concern is not military.   It is the emerging AI industry that could jeopardize US's leadership in both technology and economy.
These vids are SO DAMN GOOD! Even when I know a lot about a topic... I always learn more.
Its really weird that these huge world powers are spending billions and going in to a war over a tv show from the 70s.
Just discovered this channel.   This guy’s amazing.
Cyberpunk 2077 always comes to mind when i hear Microchips
Tiny pieces of metal? wtf?
They're going to cut us off and we're going to suffer.
I'm just proud of my country as a Taiwanese. And I appreciate all the collaboration with the US. Let's continue be friends!
the problem is, if we ever fought a hot war with china, the United States would probably lose like it did in Vietnam. i will also point out that Joe Biden as general-in-chief is a clown with dementia, and no matter how big your gun is, you have to be able to aim it, and sleepy joe is incapable of such things like victory, military expertise, and overall ability to get even the most basic things done. if there is a war, china will probably win it. they are cunning, smart, and have a bigger arsenal than us. China is also more willing to get its hands dirty because it isn't as decadent as the US. the United States has been weakened by infighting, government incompetence, bad foreign policy, and a sense of squeamishness and "Pampered Prince Syndrome" that has come from a long period of peace. if there is a war with China, the United States as it stands today is fucked.
No mention of Russia and developments there as if their scientific/technolgical/military applications endeavors don't exist and matter whatsoever?!?!  As we smugly deride their conventional military's performance in Ukraine, hellooo, anyone noticing the nuclear hypersonic and nuclear hypersonic glide missiles technology that Russia has not only designed but is DEPLOYING, as well, along with the development and deployment of their  S -500 defensive system around Moscow, St. Petersburg, et al. cities?!?!  How are they held by you kind folks at 'arms' length from the micro-chip discussion you present here??!!
Just leaving a THANKS  for this very  informative, great paced & interesting Video Documentation.  I’m sure a  lot of work went into this!
as a consumer i couldn't care less about all the conspiracy theories, i'm sick and tired of all the monopolies and duopolies, just look at the prices of their products (hi nvidia, amd, intel, etc..), i couldn't care less if china innovate themselves or hack and steal as long as it puts them on a level footing to compete. And I do not believe that they will start an actual war at all, like they're the two biggest economies in the world, they would lose so much if there was a war.
Yh yh but for some reason we can’t go back to the moon because the tech no longer exist right?  9:12 - technology in our home more complex than what they used to go to the moon.
Johnny "Harrish"'s lisp drives me nuts.
Vox did a microchip video After you did! 😄 And yours was better!! Loving it! Keep it up, doritos&🥢,, actually I wasn't all the way through it.... there's is pretty good! But, they knew what to cover, stuff you didn't include.  I 👀 you Vox. Well played.
This was one of the best doc’s I’ve seen in a hot minute. Great job to you and the team!!
Funfact: Trump Trade War was also meant to prevent China surpassing USA and Allies technologically  Democrats didn't like it they want further escalation tho
The graphics and B-roll in this video was dooope. or should I say FABolous
They need to just start making them in space
9:07  faster and smaller  didn't come out right !
All of them have petroleum also.
Oh thank u for enlightening us great sage Johnny❤❤
Shouldn't have sold ANYTHING to China from the jump that would help their military Period! If anyone did  still get them for treason, seriously. That might sound extreme but how extreme do u think that hypersonic missile sounds when it's blowing up Americans all bc of the chips other Americans sold to china...Matter fact we shouldn't even be teaching Chinese citizens in our schools just so they can go take it back to China and use it against us (everything We taught them)... No I'm not racist by a long shot (I can't stand everyone equally, jk) but it's only obvious just like the 9-11 hijackers learned how to fly in America to use it against us, China is doing this on a bigger scale...
Really a good one! I'm sending my greeting from Taiwan!
US just stole Olivetti technology in the 60'
Thank you tons!  I love watching your vids.   Most of the things you report on I have very little clue about and even if I spent time researching, I likely wouldn’t find and be able to process the info as succinctly as you do. I am so appreciative of how clearly you share the facts, present them in a way that I understand, and make it all interesting.   Awesomesauce to you!
I have lots of chips. I have potato chips, plantains chips, and much more. 🤭
Lol USA is so pathetically insecure. Hilarious. I hope it fucks them in the ass.
Very informative, very satisfying to watch and most of all you learned lots of knowledge there, very well explained sir......
Vox stole your video.
they using our technologies, simple, insert a Line of code  in the programing of chip that will break any non proprietary use or authorized use, I don't see why was never implemented from day one, is like Trojan horse, and is a simple as it sound, if they try to change the code, make the chip useless
Thank lord trump isn't popular anymore
Basically, moral of the story is, USA promotes globalization, then realizes it can't compete, and retreats, puts up roadblocks to new emerging powers to compete fairly in a global marketplace.
Came here from the newer Vox vid. They basically took your idea and changed up a few words
I feel like I was just let in on a little secret about the nature of modern humanity that isn't as widespread as it should be. The tech race IS an arms race fundamentally.   Whoever is winning the arms race soon will get to win more of the economics and global policy race as well, which is just status quo historically.
Lol, trader Joe's. Maybe Google popped the first Touring test, and it's been silent and wants it to be the best. Chips are an important resource for a mechanical uhm... intelligence. Ok, ok taking the tin foil hat off. You should checkout why files, up and coming channel. No I am not a youtuber I just think you guys could get along. Good work ya got my sub and likes for future content.
I noticed Johnny's certain topics are being reproduced by another channel. 👀
whoa wait, at 17:15 you said the whole US is abasically reliant on Taiwan for their fabs and this is only partially true. Intel still has their FABs in the US and other countries.
No, the TSMC factories will not be destroyed,  and they will not be empty for long.   This will not happened and if it did  happen the U.S. would be in big trouble based on your own assessment of 90% of our chips not coming anymore.
You should definitely start a podcast
China has no sense of humor according to Jimmy O Yang therefore USA wins again.
If its Only about chips are fine, but the US want wars around the world to make money and stay on top. This is the problem. Example: Ukraine , Syria ... etc
They want to kill us and we are selling them all the tools for the kill ?  Yeah.  We are capitalist addicted to money and profits?  Yeah.  Well what woke us up?  Military asleep?
this is when toy vote for sleepy joe...
Not ohaiooooo
Nice desk.
the cold war had a berlin blockade, the chip war may have a taiwan blockade
nice china
Stop saying like, like , like
Eiffel 65 - silicon world
Russia saying Chinea:"first time".
I like chips.
Grew up without tech I know how to do things without it.
Maybe a fitting notion would be  'neo-neo synthesis' by Ole Waever (1996), aka a complex liberal-realistic approach to geopolitics. I also like to think that the US is using Its exceptionalistic doctrine and pragmatism to gain advantages and protect Its role as a global hegemon. The USA is at the end moving between the dichotomies of being isolationistic and expansionistic; this is the pragmatic US geopolitical approach, and It has been so for a long time. Lone ranger
Its America's technology so its America's right to reserve
Ironically, American company got greedy in profit cause all this to happen lol
The language of the future is Binary, understanding code is the key to the cyberpunk future.
28:24 They wouldn't know how to operate them? What an arrogant douche! First of all, they have engineers who already know how to operate and integrate American Chip technology. Also, if they recall half the engineers that were laid off from Microsoft, Google, and the other tech companies, they can even make it better. So stop commenting on stuff you know nothing about..
So this is saying that China doesn't have smart enough people to design and produce there own micro chips.......ya totally America and Taiwan are the only countries that have the skilled people to stitch switches on a slice of material accessible for every sing country...........ngl they haave balloons over your head.......
VOX just posted the same video right now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My silicon crystal…silicon.
silly kuhn sounds stupid as hell
Microchips are reaching their technological plateau and we need to start protecting the resources for creating quantum computers because that shit will go light years ahead
Hi Nick!
I have the notification bell on for your videos and this the first one to pop up for me in years love your content
Why are the universities in China are also banned to use the software from US companies, if the military supremacy is the only thing that Biden is concerned about?
Gotta read Col Phillip Corso Book Day After Roswell and this is 100% Alien Technology
The glass in the film camera you picked up has silicon in it, so you were right when you picked it up.... just saying ;)
The more you watch this guy's vids, the more you will realize he is just a CIA shill. 🤣🤣
Great soundtrack. Care to share the playlist?
The balloon, you called it so good
is there a limit to how small and advances this can get?
you remind me of Bill Nye
At lest not yet. lets hope man.
Johnny, as a dad with some of the most excellent dad jokes around, I thoroughly applaud your dad jokes about chips. You are ready for fatherhood, my friend
So to end all wars we must ban micro-chips. Wow. That was simple. Problem people solved.
Its all Joe's fault and people like him.
N ya, globalization is making countries turn to nationalism n looking at history, that “ism” turns to world wars so who knows what will happen.
hey johnny your a really cool and funny guy.  thanks for your new on all these different topics.   I bet a ton of work goes into making these and people like you and your team are vital to having an alternative to mainstream media that I have come to believe is not as forthcoming with important information.  What you and people like you do is important so please does your best to stay an honest independent journalist ok don't lose your way sir.
Why didn't we just , plant a kill switch in all the chips for China , and use it if needed ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Silicon based technology will be replaced by graphene from twistronics in the next 20 years
it was not just american chips tech that helped china but even american companies and universities all which have been fined since then by the tens of millions $
Thank you for clarifying this. It is very important.
The US has also been dealing with theft of intellectual property by, ahem “someone”, for a long time now.
US: *Blocks Chip Trade*  China: Sends a Big Balloon  US: Pops it  China: Bro's Overreacting
Taiwan is China actually. If you check it’s official name
💩 tin didn't stop the gas and Bran don just let the CC P float a balloon over the US
So... America started it?
Yeah which uses taxpayer money to pay f****** these tech companies so they don't sell chips to China what company take losses all the time and who's to say that they're not telling me ships to some other company outside of the United States in debt companies not selling chips to China
They want access to that s*** they got to pay Joe or should I say the big guy
Okay now ask yourself any of those top-secret documents that were found in Biden house have anything to do with that cuz we all know he's been selling information to China for years even sold and blueprints to the F-35 which we already said long time ago that China would never ever get that kind of a van information from us but yet soon as Joe Biden gotten office gets what China gets the blueprints to the F-35 so if they've built Hypersonic missiles just makes you wonder whether they got this Tech from top-secret documents Joe Biden sold to them not saying that that is the case but just seems awful funny that in the last couple years their Technologies Advanced this far and we all know China's been stealing Tech from America for years
the way he continouesly called it a piece of silicon with switches on it triggeres me a lot. Especially whe he is dependented on it in every way.  i am triggered because i understand how complicated this shit is .i know how complicated it is to do basic silicon circuites with these transistors let alone "the silicon piece with switches" he is talking about
“There lies a sleeping giant. Let him sleep! For when he wakes he will shake the world”  -----  Napoleon Bonaparte "Herein lies an aging giant. Let him sleep! For he has been partying too hard and no longer has the energy." ----- Me
Yeah unless you got people like Joe Biden and her selling them secrets
Ridiculous that people spend thousands of dollars on a school for somebody to tell you to read a book when you can just go buy that book and read it
Funny how we build microchip student Troy each other and the tree weapons but we don't use them to better mankind there's trillions of planets out there it is on if you don't like your neighbor figure out a way to leave the planet and get your own technology in ways to destroy one another rather than to make life better and to expand life to other place stupid counterproductive to me
The real future lies in the moon, the moon's resources
So they actually listen to trump 😅
Who is here after spy balloon
We need to kick out china from wto
China  just stole their technology
China lol😂💔
Think these u tubers would defend our country if something ever happens 🤔
correction on the Regan section. Goal, national wealth. Achieved. He was one of the greats.
14:20 I feel sorry for the investor who was forced to invest in TSMC. I hope he made his money back.
Johnny, I suspect that you have a team works for you to come out such impressive work, this is a very complicated issues involved history, technology knowledge etc.. not 100% correct but close enough and very impressive.
Ah. Googling “fact check Johnny Harris” makes me click off at 7:03.
I can bunk my clg lectures but not harris' one 😎
I wonder how many trees Johnny has killed with his printing addiction 🤦🏻‍♂️
Pues que se fumo este vato 😂😂
Johnny should do a video on how effing evil the thing Reagan did were/are
Great stuff Man. You really pull allí the strings together. Things you wont find in the news. All what Is said here Is huge!
Globalization isn’t good for the majority of Americans. Globalization hit the middle and lower class particularly hard by sending those jobs overseas.
American semiconductor companies create threat to national security through their own short sighted greed.. In turn American government punishes them by giving them billions of dollars of our money? I would laugh but I sold my diaphragm last week to pay for groceries.
This VIDEO Is biased. Do your research before u say stupid shit like that
Ahh, Taiwan followed the old adage……”During a gold rush, sell shovels.”
US giving Visa's for Asian/other Nation's Brains to invent things for them and call it US technology China: Hold my beer! I'm gonna use US tech to get ahead of US tech US: Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
Overproduced and melodramatic. I wish you would chill out.
When you hear someone claim that "Biden is weak on China," just show them this video.
Thanks for doing this video. I myself work for an American Semiconductor fab that is based in singapore. This encourage me to continue to further develop my career in this field... Thumbs up
Reminder to any lurking wumao's that Taiwan is a beautiful, sovereign nation superior to China in just about every way. Thanks 😊
The Chinese military doesn't need high end chips, military equipment doesn't need TINY chips, these tiny high end 5nm chips are used for smart phones. Both Taiwan and China trade freely and have co-existed peacefully for decades, for like 70 years. China can make their own domestic lithography machines, which means they can make 28 nm chips, covering 90%  of all chips needed. The true intention is to cripple China's economy. A lot of inacurracies here.
Capitalism
Nice video
that baloon stunt really makes sense after watching this
Ironic timing with this video lol, wonder what the ripple effect from the balloons will cause.
战鹰
The chips of the military of any country do not need TSMC, and 80nm is enough. Advanced chips are only used in consumer products
Small fab hub with micro bugs that code what ever an clean disks. Unmanned.. The bug is robot the chip is the egg. Get it done
Didn't you forget rareearth materials
Wow!! What an amazing content!!
Have you done a deep dive into where the materials come from to make these silicon chips?  Like... What's going on in the Congo?  Basically slave labour to pull these materials from the earth?  The mines involved, the players involved, the conflicts involved?
Looks like it’s gonna be the war we can see soon
Too bad China is just buying 1000s of aches in u.s. and taking over universities and flying spy balloons all over and just stealing the info instead
Do you think the recent Chinese balloon in America is essentially a poking stick?
Great job! Loved this video .. Thanks for an amazing story broken down where even I can understand it lol
Considering a Chinese UFO was just discovered over the US, I think this video proved it.
hi, hick!
Why criticize Reagan when he was making sure usa made money? How’s democrats working for you so far?
Just watched this one. Great piece. You are absolutely killing it, Johnny. No one comes within 1,000 miles of you for breaking down complex topics in such an articulate and entertaining way. Well done, sir.
YOU CALLED IT
Insert Chinese Spy Balloon
The main way technology grows is challenge, America knowing China historically was the most prolific innovator nation the world has ever known, placed our super critical information within osmotic distance, we allowed them to amplify many different aspects of that technology only to reverse  flow it right back thus amplifying our total sum. ingenious, hopefully not as stupid as it appears
Nope https://youtu.be/i8Kaqa93ilQ
Amazing! I love humans. ❤
That's why Corporate America has exported all that tech surveillance stuff to China? Maybe you should start thinking instead of picking up tech bones.
There's no reason it should last that long condense your material please you reach a broader audience
Not gonna lie, I was waiting for Skillshare 😂
How is it that when Biden puts his glasses on, he looks legally blind?
Time to cut China off!!
Level up
this was an amazing piece of storytelling
Does anybody know of any scholarly articles or journals over the act
They should just relocate from Taiwan to USA and still use their money made here to benefit Taiwan no USA taxes etc
u are TOP ;)
Thank you
Wow, fresh perspective. Great!
America’s weakness = Money  With money you can buy out American Politicians, Scientist, Businesses, Weapons
your videos are the best history lesson.
Can you imagine if we stopped the bs and all the countries worked together to build spaceships and conquer new planets?
Better pray Chinese doesn’t figure out how to make their own chips. They have all the raw materials needed unlike other countries who only have some of the raw materials needed.
China’s population drops like a rock moving forward due to the one child policy. India will pass them and USA France and Mexico will be in a good position vs others.
It must be working- because China is reduced to sending over balloons
Reese's Peanut Butter cups video dropping soon 👀
The chip act looks more like a payoff of politicians in Whashington DC to silicon Valley. It's too late already, we are almost 100% dependent on foreign microchips, and those companies receiving these billions of dollars will keep on selling their new technology and developing their products overseas... no restrictions on any of these in the act in reality. Also, it was an executive order, which can easily be dismantled; if it was such a good idea why it did not go through the legislature, which both chambers, if Congress were democrat majority? Something fishy about this...
LOVED THIS! became the topic of today's dinner convo
You are forgetting a crucial part of all this problem: The US Congress taxing and regulating everything in the USA in such a huge way that the American industry is practically destroyed. Many US companies in order to survive went to other countries. I could even say that the destruction of the American Industry was by design because the same Congress who killed industries and American jobs, turn around and gave Free Trade Agreements to all those countries, perpetuating the destruction of our Industry and making other countries like China superpowers... The USA, the so called leader of The Free World selling its soul to the biggest violators of human rights in history along with Nazis, Muslims and Medieval Catholics. If America was for human rights and freedom, should not buy one single product from China who enslave and kill its own people and have them living in misery... of course, nobody cares about people in China or anywhere else, as long as I can live comfortable, right?
Haha there's totally not a Chinese spy drone floating over Montana right now.. ha..ha......
I know someone thought it was a cursed cause whatever her eyes sees 👀 others also can see it and whatever her mind thinks, others can know what she is thinking. She wishes it could be removed
Thanks mate for the enlightenment
What's anyone doing to help China and USA understand that they need to be on the same team for the next century? Otherwise, Global Warming will destroy them both (and possibly really help Russia, as Crimea is a lot less important when the Baltic becomes ice-free.)
'....on steroids!', so- cranky and with tiny testicles?
All down to the greed of western companies and their directors! Amazing video, never even realised how interwoven the globalisation can be weaponised. However feeling the effect of the Russian gas, but realising our own govt is using this as a weapon against us for control.
Johnny what’s the soundtrack that you have used in this video 10:38
Red China wants you to think it is protecting itself from CIA coup d'tat by showing its military teeth at us Americans.  the ruling class over there, however, continues to send their offsprings to this continent ---all the while telling their own economically disadvantaged populace to hate the US/Cananda/Europe. I despise the Red Chinese because they are going down the path of Facist Germany and Japan---and worst, they are taking a page off our White Men's destiny ideology from the last century.(geo-expansionism) very scary indeed.
But china will overcome  obstacles and become semiconductor  giant....
Me cooking up transistor doritos in my basement: i'll rule the world one day
Of course corporate greed is to blame for the sharing of US chip secrets. Not surprised.
This video doesn't make sense at all, the reason why the world had a chip shortage was because Japan had a fab shop burned down, so yeah, I don't think this video is accurate
Thanks for the history lesson, but I lived through all of it. I'm well aware. It seemed fun in the 60s 70s and 80s. It's really not so much fun anymore.
Love your  videos !!!
Your so late to this 😂
The US wont abandon Taiwan.... UNTIL she (US) can stand on its own. Then its afghanistan baby , nope we out overnight.
Best Johnny Harris video by far. Would it be possible to listen the music tracks?
Thank you for your unbiased journalism. Excellent.
Johnny, your soundcreator guy/girl are amazing!!!!  Really pro-sound! BTW thanks for interesting videos - keep up the good work!
Anyone know anything about the team that was on MH370 that had to do with very advanced microchips or something like that?
this is why graphics cards are so expensive it’s annoying
14:58 : Fight !
Let me rephrase that. “Good luck you god damned rice farmers” lmao.
To be honest, you really did not focus enough on the role of ASML in The Netherlands. It is estimated that ASML is atleast 10 years ahead of the competition with their machines. ASML has a total monopoly on all machines that make 5nm chips. Almost every device you own was made with a ASML machine. The US can only design chips that ASML machines allows them to make. The US lobbied The Netherlands to stop selling ASML machines to the Chinese. China has all the resources to design the software and architecture of these chips, and they have been doing so for years. The only thing stopping them from doing so is the fact that they cannot get access to the latest ASML machines that's made in The Netherlands.   America is not the centre of the world.
Why did China have to build that hypersonic WMD? If they never did that, the world would be a better place. I don't understand the need for WMDs. It is psychotic to build such weapons. They are a waste of resources and do nothing but create hysteria and perpetuate the cycle of conflict.
Joe Biden is saving America.  You want to fail like the Romans, then go ahead fellas, vote for Desantis or Trump or whatever else.  You can fail, you can let the dream dye now if you want but you don't have to, it's not over.   There are people who knows what they're doing, vote for them.
Johnny Harris called taiwan a country 😮😮
you have an amazing ability to mix some facts with a bunch of bs
Fabulous topic choice.   Do more on geopolitics
HEY JOHNNY HARRIS, I wanted to know, why as a very big investigating journalist who has covered some controversial topics, issues, politics has not covered on what is happening with the PALESTINE/ISRAEL conflict and what is being done on both sides.. Is cause you don't like the truth or is there a higher power authority, government, or sponsorships that are/is preventing you from covering this TOPIC?
I'm tired of people playing up Chinese and Russian hypersonic missiles. They are not ahead of the USA. We simply realized how useless they were and stopped pursuing their development of them back in the 50s. All regular ballistic missiles are already massively hypersonic and impossible to shoot down. This is a waste of time-consuming research for some show boating, and the USA only pretends to be afraid as an excuse for more policies and military funds.
hey greate USA and from what u made new chips when u need rare earth minerals for them ? and theirs biggest supplier is China if China stop selling rare earth to USA then USA is fckup xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD  China accounts for 63 percent of the world's rare earth mining, 85 percent of rare earth processing, and 92 percent of rare earth magnet production.
steve jobs and bill gates? what about jack tremiel that built commodore? they were in far more homes than apple and ibm
Great video! One criticism though, you made it sound like Biden was the one making those decisions, when he obviously isn't able to
Alright, Jonny Boy, you say we rely on chips just like you do with Doritos.
Awesome documentary..opened my eyes 👀 big time
A long time ago treason meant helping an outsider rise above your own. Now everyone’s blinded and in it for an infinite dollar
I imagine Biden probably called Frito lays first and told them if they sale any more chips to China they will be sanctioned. Now the Chinese can’t get their Doritos.
Jokes on chjna i believe the "moores law" is ending
1:49 Ohh hello nick!
12:20 india and Pakistan are shown together with china occupying indian territory??
Soon as u said land on the moon i left 🤣
what about the issue on the start of the supply chain? china is not only the final costumer, but the primary source of the resource
Heading to Taiwan for ETCH Chamber Engineer training next month, great insight. Thank you.
Guess I’m gonna brush up on my mandarin 😅
I really enjoy your presentation style but gosh you're trying too hard.
Funny enough you dont need Scaler, your advertisement, to enter the semiconductor field and flourish as an engineer (they send you to school) or microchip manufacturing specialist, which all you need is a highschool diploma.
fair presenter
It's possible some of this technology, that has advanced more in the past 100 years, than anytime in any other time in human history, came from Alien👽 intervention.   We can't be the only ones out there, when there are billions of other galaxies and universes in space.
Hopefully things don’t escalate to where China sneaks a balloon into the US
Stop buying CCP exports 🇨🇳
Is Taiwan 🇹🇼 now an independent country? Because last I checked even the USA 🇺🇸 agrees that Taiwan is and remains part of China 🇨🇳 . I think your take on china 🇨🇳 is a little biased.
you have become a freat teacher.
I think there is a different reason why he likes to speak into a microphone
Thank you so much for sharing with us~!
This is all in all a good video but I have to disagree about the war and conflict evolving. War never changes and in the end this will end in bloodshed. Just as it has since the beginning of our existence.
So.... what happens to Taiwan after all these Fabs and other facilities go live? Does Biden say to China, "Ok, she's all yours! Have fun!" Fact: The U.S. is NOT going to war over Taiwan. Within the next ten years, if it has not already happened, China will have its own facilities. Did anyone forget where most rare earth minerals are on the planet? China is now just as advanced as the West. That's just a Fact. Get over it and move on. No One Needs To Go To War. China has moved on. To what? To real estate. If it's worth owning, they either already do or are in the process. What are Americans doing? Banking the Bucks. Selling out their country once again. Sad. And we did it to ourselves.
"semiconductors, microchips or integrated circuits, these are all the same thing"  27 seconds in, false information already, goodbye. a semiconductor isn't necessarily an integrated circuit.
I think China is already the new modern Soviet
This guy really hates China :)
So funny. I was thinking the whole video what a cool colour shirt that was and ping AI.... DARN ... maybe a video on AI?
Nvidia can't sell the chips now so they're gouging us on graphic cards
Mmm notice how he had to eat at the end ..isn't  food and water the thing that needs protection ......
You are one smart dude thanks for simplifying such a complicated subject for us to understand..
Actually it wasn't just wires before transistors it was vacuum tubes which is where the term bug comes from because the light emitted from these vacuum tubes would often attract insects and cause components to frequently burn out hence a bug in the system
China is friends with Russia too, who we've recently pissed off 😂
What a drama queen, don't fall for this sensationalism. So much for integrity.
"metal like substance" ? More like glass, with metal layers for interconnects.
So what happened they stop pay off to Joe and the rest of the criminal's that are selling out the country
It's all 'rich' people fighting amongst themselfs. I feel no tension. Try using those chips for something other than war, then there's no tension, anywhere..
wait till dhruv tatti copies ur video
india would be X Factor
thanks so much for the video, very educational.  fwiw Peter Zeihan has some takes on Globalization being dead and post US Globalization geo-politics
Thanks! 💪🏼😎👍🏼
This is brilliant. It's high time the US did something about china. It's a goddamn oppressive, autocratic regime that is hell bent on expansion and annexation
Buy your peanut butter cups from Aldi. Eat them frozen. Same product. Half the price.
9:34  Him "...these :"  Me : No shit ! backrooms are real !
A+ content, production, and execution.
The question everyone should be asking themselves is; Who wins? Who wins in every scenario?   Answer: the military industrial complex, that's who. Makes you wonder if they created the problem in the first place in order to enrich themselves. After all, money IS the root of all evil. War is, and always will be, extremely lucrative.
I remember K maps from my electrical engineering degree.  Look them up if you want a cool party fact.
Interesting but flawed video Taiwan is considered a part of China In the words used in the video China invading its neighbour  A country cannot invade itself a total non sequitur  The other factor being the human condition  Humanities greatest achievement is adaptability  I am sure that China will overcome any problem with chip manufacture eventually
Ww3 inbound
How green are those FABs?   Aren't you being a white nationalist by suggesting the US is a great power?
Interesting video, cheers for that! I see parallels between the geopolitics of microchips with that of lithium. Would be interesting if you did a video on the Lithium Triangle and how Sino-American competition implicates the green energy transition
nice
This...... 🤦
So how exactly the USSR built up so many advanced weaponry if USA had the monopoly on chips ?
Why did I see Estonian flag in the end of the video?
China won, they exported fentanyl.
Thumbs up
this is only the second vid ive watched of yours and im totally sucked in now, you are a fantastic journalist
One thing that needs to be mentioned: Xi Jinping actually invested billions upon billions to build their own chipmaking industry a decade ago in anticipation of this problem. However, when the US made noise about blocking the chips from US, he inquired on the investment he made. Unfortunately, he didn't get a good answer: the chipmaking industry was woefully lacking, and it seems that those billions instead lined up many people's pockets. So a bunch of the state-owned chip manufacturer's executives were arrested last August.
i hate ccp
No worries, China can never catch up with the west in technology, period.
False, hypersonic middle are old technology False, the software sold to design these chips are not the cutting edge you believe False, there's a spectrum of the type of chips and which can be circulated globally.
I like how degenerate Americans try to call anyone "aggressive". Lmao. Projecting hard.
This guy's got more than one sponsor if you know what I mean...
Your channel is so good, you do your homework and really make these topics interesting
Sooo America caused our own problems again….?
What the US have done is the typical strategy of the loser, if I can’t beat them I will ban them. 😏
The mature chip production' is king, and it needs a mature and big market base like China.
Forgot to like the video, so re-watched an ad just to like it.
Chips sell like hotcake.Every inventions need it.Economy Wars indeed.
He commits qualified fraud himself and is a fraudulent
When we made sand sentient the robot uprising began
I’m boycotting military equipment until I get a Ps5, governments has its priorities twisted.
oops!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thanks for using your platform to finally let the normies know what's up
He's getting one part wrong..... It wasn't luck. We didn't bump into this serendipitously. Private industry Bell Labs, and fed gov, DoD DARPA ARPA invested hugely into the research.
... and while big countries fight the chip wars, bitcoin is borderless and its computation power goes through the roof every day ;D
johhny harris is a crook and a scammer.
You spent exactly five seconds on the role of the Netherlands in this. Why the hell didn't you go into more detail? You describe ASML's EUV machines as "magic" and then completely ignore them... You do realize that Moore's law eventually runs into physical limitations and that ASML has a "stranglehold" (not my words) on the chip industry because of this, right? That is the reason that Biden is going further than American companies in than he's trying to forbid ASML (a Dutch company) from selling their equipment to China.
It's real funny how you think Russia cutoff oil to Europe who do you think bombed the pipelines from Russia to Europe I'll give you three guesses one Hint it wasn't Russia Russia wouldn't bomb their own pipeline so what's your guess
Not to mention China is constantly stealing things from anybody they can. Also, we shouldn't forget, one of the biggest reasons why Japan attacked us, is because we blocked their oil. Let's hope China doesn't decide to do that as well. They probably already have everything they need to make their own though. Honestly, in hindsight we should have allowed Japan to continue to attack China..
Aka taiwan
Not so ironic to use the virus as an example
This dude did maybe 15 minutes of research for his 30 minute video. If you actually want to learn about fabs,  you should watch some of the many channels on youtube that actually specialize in this subject.
lol,  we still use the long wires,  they're just on circuit boards now.
google says sillicon is atomic number 14 and its a non-metal bro
This video is very informative, all information are cited specifically and easy to understand. Thank you for a good video !!!
Thanks for making these videos so we can be more informed.
They can still buy chips thru proxy countries la
Since you came this far, why not go one step further to explain why China is growing its military like a madman? For fun, I guess.
Yeah, But It Wasn't Biden Who Put The US People On Alert, It Was Trump.  Biden's Administration Badly Needed Some "Credit" Because His Ratings Were Tanking.  Trump Got The Ball Rolling With Higher Tarffs On The CCP. 🙊🙈🙉🤑🤡🇺🇸💯
good job
You're trying so hard to make China seem like this imperialist villain. It's like you're talking about an Eastern US. CHINA DOESN'T DO WAR ANYMORE. They don't support them in any way. You won't see China helping Russia or Ukraine directly in their stupid war, you don't see China in the Middle East meddling with local governments, EVEN IN THE SOUTH 'CHINA' SEA things have been de-escalating for some time now. All they negotiate is trade. It's clear the CCP has a strong anti-war policy they've been enacting for quite some time. And it's obvious China still needs the military because EVERY country needs one. Particularly a big player like them. So why the hell are you trying to paint them as an imperialist power like the US? CHINA IS NOT THE US. This "war" is completely one-sided. This is ridiculous.
What happens when the Chips eat each other, and then there is the Fish to make Fish and Chips!
very nice , understandable for anyone
Yup, thank godness someone is aware of it. USA vs China thats the war who conects the whole world but it is excually going..
Dude you've left so much out of this and it's all the information you need to actually have a fair picture of this "war" which is COMPLETELY ONE SIDED. You just made US propaganda. What is China actually doing in all this? NOTHING
The Trilateral commission meeting held in Tokyo on 19 Nov 2022, consisting of invitation-only elites Asia Pacific group made of politicians, Finance minister officials, scholars, some members of the EU and NATO.  Interestingly the administration of U.S president Joe Biden, in it's first national security strategy released in October, the administration noted that China is the "only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to do so."     If this Tokyo gathering showcased anything, it was that the Asia Pacific group is concerned about the intensifying competition between U.S and China, makes sense as China is extremely crucial for Asia, even though China seemingly isn't trusted. The discussion went further than geopolitics into economics as a South Korean economist raised a point that most countries are battling with now, that his country would inevitably have to choose between U.S or China for tech purposes. "There is an increasing number of dual purpose products in the manufacturing sector" he said, "Therefore if you want to stay ahead in competitiveness, you have to choose which tech ecosystem you belong to. The choice that we are pressured into is not politics but also very much economic pressure."  A fascinating discussion, you should check it out.
Gracias a ti y a todos tus amigos, parientes y familiares, digas lo que digas sobre el desarrollo de la tecnología electrónica y los buenos sistemas, por ahora no estoy contento porque Cuando mi conciencia pregunta y pide a los interesados ​​que respondan preguntas que yo he hecho antes solo hace que se me desmorone el corazón, retrasar retrasar el tiempo De hecho, solo da una apertura para que el éxito cambie con el fracaso, la felicidad cambie con la miseria, la luz comience a oscurecerse, el corazón y la mente sean como una amistad que no es mutua. Entiende... no pienses en mi vida y nunca me presentes nada hermoso si todo hace que mi vida se disuelva en la miseria es solo un hazmerreír e insultos, nada Los que creen lo que digo porque el verdadero éxito sigue estando con ustedes 🙏🙏🙏🙏🌍 Que Dios siempre les de felicidad a todos
That was an amazing video. Editing made it a whole lot easier to understand and the content was on point. You just gained a new subscriber! Excellent work keep it going
Yeah Just Wait Until You Have To Wear That Micro Chip Inside Your Body To Either Buy, Sell, Or Go  Anywhere 🤔🙏
Keep up the quality work.
China launched the microchips war over 30 years ago but Western governments blindly refused to acknowledge it because of money!
And, of course, some of this story is truth, some is total lie. Of course you don't just simply decide to be "USAs friend" and produce "their" chips. It is the other way around. US decided to build the fabs off-shore for cheaper workforce and lower to no taxes. Strategically... this... was a mistake.
amish: lol u guys 👁👄👁
important vedeo
It's not like we can just invite the one company to move here or open one location here or just make our own 😂
nice explanation,
Which of these countries has a constitution and amendments enshrining the rights of the individual citizens of that country. Which of them is a tyrannical communist nation that murdered and starved millions of people in the 20th century.
It's video is very better for me
And there’s Congo that supply silicon 😂
I don’t think anyone can match the US in military might. They would have to outsmart us to beat us.
Make some real friends that have your back and know you’ve got theirs, go camping and don’t take a cell phone, bring a paper book and a journal, maybe an analog film camera, and carry some cash with you in case the place you need to buy something isn’t able to run your credit card. Start a fire and cook your own meals. Pray to God and acknowledge him as your creator and the reason you’re breathing.
... what happened with "Ronald Reagan The Prophet of Free Market and Free Trade"? ... he was a poser just like you "Johnny dreamy blue eyes" poser boy :)

"Hey! Pause! I feel really strongly that the Internet is a place where can learn to level up your professional skils. I learn all my skills on the Internet!" ... nnnnnaaaaaaaaaaaaah... xD You learn your skills at Langley ;)
The minds of Americans are very funny. You have forgotten that the motorcar tech came from Europe. Suppose the EU hide the tech and prevented it from going to America, could you have the GM, the FORD etc,etc? You are very arrogant and you haven't noticed that you are already too late. Remember where is the British empire??,? Where will be the US soon????
Vaccum tubed had reached a limit on how small we could make them. As well as requiring more power. You forgot to mention them.
this is a lie. It has nothing to do with missiles. What happens is that China does not want the USA to do again what it did with Huawei. which was leaving the company without semiconductors just when  Huawei was preparing to sell equipment in the United States
Joe and hunter Biden sold China them chips!!!
This invisible war is simultaneously working toward a converged interest of people above
the US gov gets fear about how China or Asia bounces back on hi-tech and then no more free markets, no more free trade just how to dominate other countries so as not to advance in front of the US in my opinion conflic interest geopolitical is very dangerous, and effect of these not only to china but whole the world needed semiconductor
Great episode !!!
What the US should do instead is start to innovate faster than China.
I'd be happier with a little less silicon
@1:51 hi, Nick, I'm phlezk!
Our USA always find an excuse for destroy any rival.  We lie to attacked Iraq.  We use security reason to kill HuaWei.  Now, seeing China is grow like Japan years ago, we got panic.  So we have to use military reason to stop selling chip to China.  Sooner or later, they will make it themselves.
We must stop throwing our old devices away.  Either melt them down yourself, in your basement, for rare earths and gold--or keep them forever.  No exceptions!
RF cutting gas to Europe? Lmao
Pelosi in Taiwan for exactly this fish & chips.
The Chinese haven't invented anything new in thousands of years. All they know how to do is steal. Thus China can't actually get a leg up is they would have to do better an American Wich has never happened.
How could you not at least mention moores law, you basically explained it without giving the actual words for the definition??
Went from American exceptionalism to no that's racist let's help everyone else to American exceptionalism again
the cobalt and lithium is the TRUE king
Call it a race or a competition. Calling it a war is so last century. Join us in the 21st century, where we choose different metaphors. K bud? Thx.
Most Americans don't even understand the tech industry and how China got involved with it. They mistakenly believe this is China's tech because it's built there. That couldn't be furthest from the truth. In fact, China has stolen all of this tech because it was built there. It was built there because China basically has the lowest manufacturing costs by industry standards. America lost all this manufacturing because of this. Americans want health insurance, high pay, and 401Ks.  The Federal government allowed these corporations to bale on American workers.  Now, our food is being sent there. No shit.  It's cheaper to send livestock over on a ship. Have Chinese workers process it, package it and send it back then it is to have it processed here in the States. Crazy! Cheap labor is China's only contribution in all of this.  The U.S. Federal government should've never allowed our tech to leave the country so corporations can make more money.  Now China is using this tech to bolster their military against the US. Taiwan and the U.S. protection of it is what's driving Us to war currently. An Airforce general just told all of his generals to prepare for war with China by 2025. We've given them all this manufacturing and it's not good enough. Now they want to use it to kill Us and take over the world. Preferably with Russia. Communism hasn't failed in China yet.
The American is pushing the Chinese to be self-reliance.
Fabs in Ohio 💀
I'm new... not sure how to take you yet. not that you give a shit. But so far, I'm watching more!!
So basically the theft history of china stealing tech from under the table now just going to walk over and take it from someone's hard work.
Your content is so well done. Love it
The only way to beat China is to turn the entire country into a carpark
Ironically enough, the US government embargo may be helping and saving those chip companies. I can guarantee you that by constantly selling those chips overseas to China, the Chinese are taking those very materials and fixing to make cheaper copy cat companies. Companies that will drive companies like NVIDIA out of business.
It’s not new baby
Well done son well done indeed. GLORY2JESUS
The way you tell these fascinating and thrilling geopolitical stories is so immersive !!!
Hi I'm nick 😅😅😅👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Well, shoot. Here’s the reason for all the inflation!
I once saw a documentary where they tried to remove everything that was made in China from a typical home, at the end there was not even wallpapers on the walls. Which is great for China, not so much for everyone else.
10:09 alert i see contaminants
How do I get in the game..
Hey, Johnny Harris, how much did the CCP pay you to tell this lie.  This is not fact.  This is propaganda.  The hyper-sonic weapon of which you speak cannot be possible within the communist mindset.  Creativity is always CRUSHED by dictatorial psychopathic mind bombing.   ha ha ha ha ha  Don't come to my town, Johnny CCP.  You are not welcome.
NO MORE CHIPS FOR CHINA!!! AMEN.
As a Brit, I can say with a degree of authority that our chips are the best in the world. And our fish.
Johnny can you please do a video on why eggs are so expensive? I need some real answers right now. Thanks in advance.
Good job
Awesome video really is a must watch amazing job at collecting and explaining all of this information really appreciate it
How is the US businesses not interwoven with the military. You make China sound scary but the us does the same…
Taiwan played so well, imposter alert!!
First thought that came to mind when he said "microchips" was a scene from "The Departed".   When Martin Sheen is telling Leo to keep his ears open about microproccesors. "We're going to be at war with the Chinese in 20 years and he's selling them military secrets" Not far off, film was released in 2006
Everyone wants to believe they know what’s going on but they prob don’t. There is much more cooperation between countries than it seems.
Fun fact: One of the YouTube founder is Taiwanese 🇹🇼🇹🇼❤
As much as a lot of the world looks at US foreign policy in disdain, I can understand why the US government is behaving the way they do with regards to China. Talk about unintentionally feeding a beast in which you can't exactly control in the future...
You forgot that glass used silicon.
Who else do you think is helping China develop military aside from other things like space tech - good old Ruskies whom already have that tech and knowledge.  China outsources or steals all information they get. Just look at that former US pilot that is being held in Australia for training China on flight equipment.
Great insights. Now I understand why tech firms are laying off employees in thousands and why there is a recession around the corner.... and why Gen. Minihan expects a war with China in 2025.
Seems the Chinese has been cut off of tech, chips, circuits and anything to produce tech..Mexico is better all the way around (if we think we need to outsource work) to be cheaper by American companies!! China needs to be dropped out of tech only in my opinion!
Makes me think about the vaccine for some reason.
War
Who do you think sold them the plans for it all? 😂 #FearPorn "Our tech" good old America ideology... So you take all the ideas from other countries copyright them for profits then wonder why other countries are overtaking using "your tech"...  Good job you had someone teach you to build train lines 😂  Boden saves the day and blocked it all... All those new jobs it has created... America is so great!  Tax money given to private companies to setup shop in the US... Do you think these companies are going to pay any taxes back? 😂
10 countries ans Johnny Harris recognize Taiwan as a country. Cool
Exceptionally great video
really interesting video!
Can you do a scenario analysis for climate change? Great video btw!
The quality of this video is insane. I hope you and your team get a deal with one of the big networks or Netflix to do exactly this (don’t change).
Incredible overview.
Thanks universe for biden visiting mexico 🇲🇽  .mexico supports usa 🇺🇸. 🤝  🪖 🎖
Western bias
Elon Musk War.
Silicon is you. You are silicon 🧘🏾‍♂️
Beanie genie
As a Taiwanese, I truly appreciate your explanation of Taiwan's role in the current geopolitical conflict. Thank you for making people more familiar with our country.
I genuinely believe that the American media’s constant antagonization of China is the real villain here. China has no ability or reason to invade Taiwan because that invasion would inevitably destroy the industry of the island, making it useless. But with American media antagonizing China and blaring alarms about Taiwanese independence they are insulting and motivating the Xi regime to standup and take action, sacrificing the island for their own honor. We are better suited pretending it’s a part of China and keeping our fucking mouths shut.
You shed light on an important point about economics. subsidies and import taxing are exactly what made giant markets what we know today (Korea/Japan/ UK/US) NOT globalization. Phenomenal upload as usual!
One must appreciate the amount of time and research that goes into making these videos ! Big thank you😁✌️
How clearly and concisely you have just explained such a complicated subject!! Great
God is Good and God is love repent and believe in his Son Jesus Christ always and forever amen.
soy sperging on matrix calculastions and china great, so sad
The USA has gotten fat and lazy now it's freaking out. If it has been loyal to the American worker instead of outsourcing everything. Our government is a failure, all sides for multiple decades.
4'45 of advertising !  Isn't too much ?!? I just don't want to go on listening anymore...
Sheesh!!!
Definitely my new favorite channel.. this is my dream job
Soooo this is the reason why GPU prices for GAMES are skyrocketing… Not bcs “NVIDIA HATES GAMERS”. I MEAN THEY GOTTA FIND THAT LOST 400M SOMEWHERE RIGHT
This so called "war" is only because USA want to keep its dominance on earth, like what they did to Japan 30 years ago.
Fake b00bi3s also have silicon…
Your videos are some of the absolute best content on YouTube and I love every one of them! You're awesome and thanks for making great informative videos!
nice
Your forgetting of raw material of Si where their from?
To be fair, Biden has no idea what semiconductors really are, but fortunately there are some smart people within the administration. Either way, we certainly need to make more chips in America.
Taiwan chips,this blokes on to it..
You actually ignored the fact that China is already making their own chips
ALL  chips  should be ban from any military  uses  ! ! !
They're the kind of processors they put into computers that can put a cruise missile up the ass of a camel from the other side of the planet
when you're from PRC but the video zoomed in to Taiwan while saying another country: >:/
We design them all in USA. It’s not a problem. Quick making them there they can’t make the good ones on their own already.  Make a video on Chinese real issue population collapse.
ummm
Youre still making contents?! You’re like the worst history and facts story teller!
Great video
well kept thinking about one thing in the supply chain, where is the materials for the chips coming from..?
It’s great news that the U.S. is building fabs here now!
OMGosh...was this an eye-opening informational report on a topic that now makes sense to me about our world affairs!  Thanx SO MUCH for the simple clarification to complex issues of contention!! Great Investigative Journalism!!
"WAR... WAR Nevr... uh Oh MY GOD!!!!!! "
Grass blades have silicon, actually silica.
Good.
Chinese communist party go to hell
The world is unfair and it's prone to whatever it decides to do.  Honestly converting to "faith based currency" is probably the most foolish thing the American economy ever did.   After it, our economy depends on internationally approval lest we risk hyper inflation.  Truth is though that the USD isn't completely backed by itself, it's backed by the chip AND oil now.  It's put the economy in a very dangerous situation for national sovereignty.  The nation is pretty much a vassal to a monarch in Saudi Arabia.  It's true that our military is dependent on chips and also oil too.  We can't exercise sovereignty lest we lose the USD's international spread and have no way out of the deficit.
Fun fact, the Internet was an American military invention but the World Wibe Web that runs on top it in and makes websites work is British.
Microchips smaller than DNA...on/off switches.....DNA.....................🤔
Yes, it's so evident, global trade is decreasing, which means more countries are building up their own home base factories and materials... China is getting some serious competition.,.
Behind any recent historical fuckery is Ronald Reagan
Who knew technology would lead to the end of the world as we know it. Can’t believe we didn’t see this coming and prepare better.
there's too much to say and I dont even know how to start. thank you for doing all the research with this, as I dont have the ability to do it and connect certain dots. Its really a shame that with this level of technology that can have the entire world connected, a certain few only see the potential for selfish gain that doesnt represent the wants of everyone. all that money spent could literally make our lives better in every way
military chips can all be built in china, chip war focuses on consumer chips at this moment, you must know chip industry before pulling together video like this.
Yay Capitalism!
The way he stretches a 10min video into over 30 😅
I'm from china... I hope my country can win this war
Is this what Hunter sold to China?
Wow!.....your video should be shown in schools....mandatory!
Regarding Reagan and the free market comments...At the time Japan was dumping chips (a non-free market activity) with tariffs of their own (on American imports - also non-free market), just like they did with TV's in the 1970's.
How on earth is this video just 31 minutes??? This is wholesome.
why niko G2 is making videos instead of winning the major?
I love this Video.
“China’s hyper missile and AI use American chips and software” oh boys! The capitalist American companies lol. Now US put bans on chips to China and China is screwed 😂. Well, maybe the Chinese CCP should stop promoting to their citizens that US is the enemy of China and stop being cocky just because they get little more advance 😀😀.
30:20 Putin cutting off gas from Europe.. what??  I thought it was Europe who was minimizing its dependence on russia and stopped buying Russian gas… to buy gas from USA(what a coincidence), and the the last pipe was blown up ‘the north stream’, so now only American or Arab gas. But yeah, let’s say russia did all that, just like CNN, ahaha. This YouTube ‘experts on everything’ are usually just surface knowledge these days. Probably the chips info is 70% accurate as well
Thanks man for making this video, this really are helpful in understanding our world current situation. All the conflicts and stuff. 🎉 REALLY APPRECIATE IT
Is it a war when one side has the power to choke the other?
This is a very exciting video! USA 🇺🇸 really makes the right move! USA is doing the right thing!  I have been watching this conflict since 2018 and it all makes sense.
Hahaha! I helped you! But you use that thing that I helped you with and you fight me back with it 😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 I don’t wanna be your friends now!
I'm learning a lot from this channel. Realization.
So USA dont want everyone ahead of them? Hmm
Hahaha. Don’t tell me that. I work in this industry 😂😂😂😅
Yet another great documentary. Thank you sir for your outstanding contribution to knowledge in a very short yet rich manner!
It's another example of unrestricted hybrid generation five warfare.
Maga 2024
I wonder where India is in all of these
Chips are in computers.
The transistors are already so small, they can't get smaller soon. They have to be larger than a specific size so quantum tunnelling can't occur. It will be more interesting how companies will fix this problem than just watching transistors getting smaller every generation. Also the heat problem is getting bigger and bigger. Squeezing electrons through such a tiny space ends up in a lot of heat.
Map of India is incorrect.
So you are missing a very critical company, perhaps the most important one which is ASML from Netherlands. Good explanation though
Nearly all the transistors are not on/off switches. Learn first, teach after. Don't pump bullshits in peoples heads.
This a very exhaustive, and entertaining documentary on how semi-conductors have shaped the relationship between China and the USA. Thanks.
"China's tech companies and military are connected" As if they aren't connected in the US as well.
Nano Vaxx
Hell yeah ! Nobody wants the dirty Chinese to get ahead in anything ! USA USA USA
Sweetheart I am halfway through your video and I'm sitting here not able to fathom Why, Taiwan with sell chips to China who openly talks about how they would love to invade Taiwan They are helping their enemy become strong enough to do it. 🤔 I would try my best to do zero business with my neighbor if they were openly talking about invading me. Globalization is amazing but after Russia invading Ukraine corporations are betraying their own countries for money. You don't help your enemies get strong enough to take you down. But at the end of the day I understand that we the people are not the enemies It is the governments fighting each other using us the people.
So, how much of a strategic mistake was it to provide Taiwan, which is still a Chinese provincie according to the U.N., with all of the West 's R&D un favor of cheap labor?
this video is insane
this is a very informative video. ty!
Sili-CON not Sili-KIN jeez that killed me😂
Your gotten at wrong bro. We are the leader 🇳🇱 😊
bro you forgot that Trump banned Huawei before Biden ever became Resident.
Thank you for the video Johnny.
I am asking Nathon Rich to debrunk this video again please.
Hey man, you need to look deeper into hypersonic missiles. You bought in to the hype. China is not ahead in any useful sense
That office would be fun to hack
Started from Word , finishing with digital. So sad! Bible prepared us long time ago!
I use to make these at Seagate technology in Bloomington MN
Nice work  Donald Trump was right again!
Johnny you did a really good one with this vid ! As a ce professional I approve this message.
That was a great video!  Well done.  Maybe you can explain to me why I have the urge to listen to Nirvana and visit the great state of Maine?
I put like for this video only because of Sleepy Joe’s rolling head 😂😂😂
Great informative video. Your video making skills are superb. Exiting and entertaining to watch. Keep up the quality work.
I read that 40% of researchers in the usa are foreigners including a lot of Chinese. China is developing photonic chips that will be more efficient than electronic, faster and less consuming.
When are you gonna make a video on chat GPT????
we could literally make superhumans out of silicon. I wonder if anybody has ever done that over the last 100 thousand years or whatever february 2022 purdue produced a reprogrammable microchip, so this is technology that can learn over time but doesnt experience death in the same way as humans who need to in order to evolve  I don't think it's safe to say that Joe Biden is scared of Chinese military It's a play that China would've made 30 years ago China waged economic war on the United States years ago. This is not news for them, it's just they've been winning because we're not at war with them.  We're currently moving beyond silicon technology and once we secure the manufacturing of that step, silicon these things will become more archaic like the production of the automobile.
typical video of a yankee who is interested in the US having military supremacy and becoming the world's policeman and who the f_ck has elected them as sheriff of the other countries? you ignore that the army of your country also controls and meddles in companies and people, does not imprison those who inform on them as Assange and Snowden, the excessive ambition for other people's oil and supremacy is diabolical claiming national security, which is the pretext for spending millions.
Why ego maniacs rule the world? We as a human being create things because we want to deliver value to our community and get respect in return. If we create to rule we will meet our end with loses on bouth sides sending humanity generations back to history, if we don't become united for survival of human race and our common enemy being the end of human race - we would not survive when our planet hits low reserves of resource and we would not have tehnology to move to another source of resources because we invested more in developing tehnology on creative ways to killl eachother reather than researching ways to prolongate our lifes as humans.
Really like the way you presented this. 🎉
china wins
2006-2021
♟unseen but very effective
U shoulda ate a chip instead of a Reece
The Microchip War has been raging for decades. It's now the rise of Cyber-Tech, and the Transhumanist War.
How the money works, how the economy works, problems please do the video on that
I like chips an all, but We need an update on the McDonald’s ice cream machines though.
popped up from where..?     C H I N A   !  !  !
Give this man another Emmy!
NO WONDER WE STILL SHORT OF GAMING CONSOLES
I launched  a nuke to watch  this
I'd love some content about local politics and how it ties in with global issues. Housing supply in the US is the first that comes to mind
Amazing,amazing, 🤩
I loved every minute watching this
24:26 this is killing me!what is Biden doing?😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
The biggest fight coming for USA is for pronouns and no one is talking about it.🚫
Putin did not cut off gas or oil to Europe. Suicidal Europe said they did not want it directly from Russia, but will readily take it if it passes through a middle man.
at 28:15 why you think china dont know how to operate? Maybe they don't know now but they can catch up fast.
See Trump was right about this. He mention this many time during that steel price war.
Interesting video. But his acceptance of warmongering is annoying. Conflict is not inevitable, with China it’s being consciously created, for no good reason.
China cannot be trusted.. The Americans are so stupid for loosing control of this important technology.. unbelievable
Very good documentary, although the collateral damage will also be those related business like TSMC themselves. And another detail missing is SMIC, (a Chinese chip company) which already has engineers previously working in TSMC, however there are still many pieces of the puzzle missing namely the Dutch Lazer and ofc the designs from the US. When China started to realise their vulnerability, I believe it's already too late, unless US is doing something irrational like crushing foreign competitions (i.e protectionism) like TSMC or Samsung.
It is beginning the end Communist China after Kremlin ruling System will be collapsed  very soon.
Where do you guys go to get all your economics news like how Johnny gets it??
I've actually worked at the fab in the Netherlands that you mentioned, believe me; that place is truly unbelievable in two things. First is the average iq of employees, second is the extreme security protocol in place...
america : no one can kill me, its illegal. only i am allowed to kill anyone.
Your podcast should be these YouTube videos but do more sight explaining like NPR does.
This was super interesting to watch, great content
if you'd like to learn more (kill your brain) on semiconductor chips? Watch Asianometry
Thank you.
When I can't sleep fast, I just watch Johhny Harris
As  a physics students, i dont think the term " silicon" will be suitable, should use "semiconductor" instead. Nowadays the famous chips used in milatary normally not silicon but gallium arsenine (GaAs) which have better conductivity at room temparature.
Is taiwan a country? I didn't know that 😳
all this time I've invested in TSMC, while having no idea the extent of its role in global geopolitics
America doesn't want fair fight and lose their privilege, and the whole world had enough. but they(america) are very good at it
Youd have to be the dumbest, white cunt to think a foreign, entirely obscure nation like USA has more influence in Taiwan than China does. because you morons dont even know what communism is, the amount of people that 'flee' Taiwan for mainland China is apparently "extremely high"
The only thing I got from the video other than the topic was America IS a SUPREMACIST nation. Kind of like in the medieval era where only the nobles are the most literate than their people that were lower than them in status.
sponsor seems scammy tbh do you use this?
this video is straight up propaganda
Scary how small they can make the chips.
12:25 here there is a huge mistake. China IS in the road to reunification with Taiwan, but never even thought about invade. That "invation" is the USA way to understand it.
I thought you would mention that the TSMC Arizona factory is basically a relocation of one in Taiwan. They're bringing over old equipment from Taiwan and the US is like, offering no-process visas to the workers. At least, that's what my grandfather said. I can't find any English reporting on it but he seemed pretty confident. update: my grandfather said the process is going downhill because the workers a being denied the residency permits they were promised.
Dope content! Keep it up! Do one on religion
From time to time we look at how others talk how scary about China who is going to ( still "going to" ) attack Taiwan. on the other side ,  US had crashed several other countries.
years later after trump left office,  I would say he was right about his stance on putting America first.
Cold war vibes are back
Just like how china surprised us how far they were in missile development program how can the west be certain that china doesnt know how to design, manage and run FABS??? I mean the assumptions has the exact same fallacy as with the missile program and I bet during the missile development program experts for sure argued how china was defacto behind which turns out to everyones surprise they were the opposite. Lol
Who else is going on a (killingspree) if the find a chip in their arm from a covid-19 vaccine  without any knowledge from the government?
Chips ahoi
Chips ahoi
Militant imperialists corrupting the chances of a peaceful world.
For some reason I read this as the war against microwaves
The only channel I’ll watch all the ads for the creator
Excellent video as always Johnny, it was very spicy :)
Please, stop being sensationalistic and start reporting facts more accurately.  Thanks.
incredible content Mr. Johnny Harris!  Btw, your video production is Top Shelf too!
I think you need to do some research on US-China relations a little closer than just the past few years. Biden and the left are not our friend when it comes to the China issue. They have been the catalyst for it.
It’s the free market for the US, not globalization and the global market. That’s why we have slaves in China and Africa our products today. Increase the import taxes, not taxes on Americans.  China stole information from us industry, it wasn’t simply sold.   The military of China goes hand in hand with industry because it’s a Marxist society. This is why the communists must be purged and starved out of the free world.
Damn great video man. I understood every word said haha. I have a much better understanding
Curious why we or anybody else hasn't "landed on the moon" since 69 since tech is so much better?
Didn't expect to get a quick revision of my 'Electronic Devices' course. Nice
Cut your hair homie
Your podcast should just be interviews with people from the industry and government or who have written books on the topic being featured.
It should have been Computer Engineers @ 6:41 instead of Science
Canadian in Taiwan,  USA is building TSMC plans for backup, and people here are willing to blow up the factories here if China comes to action with force
Yes, US will start a war to get them benefit.
congrats for the video!! love when intelligent and funny people really get me into learning new stuff.
I think the most likely thing to happen is that China will go ahead with the blockade debilitating the economic viability Taiwan chip making, eventually the US are gonna import all the brains and know how into their territory and Taiwan will end up being conquered.
Every war starts in board rooms
As a matter fact todays' militaries equiptment including missile etc do not use 3nm chips (as in mobile phone and PC's). Military uses 20nm+ chips and China makes plenty of those on their own.
When I heard Transistors... I knew what would be next few min of the video. Mainly here for the geopolitical reasons..
Wasn't it against WTO rules to add 100% tariffs on Japanese chips?
9:26 Captions - Crows Cheers, Pun unintended
The “problem” with China doing a naval blockade of Taiwan, is that China itself is vulnerable to a naval blockade from the various US lead alliance at various chock points across the world. China is a net importer of hydrocarbons as well as food. China can’t afford to be subjected to a naval blockade.
map of india is wrong 19:57 sec
After watching this I suddenly feel like Taiwan is 100% worth protecting lol. My Taiwanese brothers where you at???
I found your channel a few weeks ago. I listen to your videos as podcasts at work all day. Thanks for all your research, work and content.
Bro you bombed explaining binary 😂
nice, good one man 👍
They´re ahead or they´re bluffing like Russia used to?
👍🇧🇷🇷🇺🇮🇳🇨🇳🇿🇦👌😁👏👏👏👏
Great video 👍thanks for breaking everything down for us💯
Violation of basic principles of international trade described in the most convoluted and alarmist way.
Well someone better shit out some microchips, because I ordered an EFI unit from Holley almost a year ago and it still hasn’t shipped yet.
American are the blame for the rise of china's power.  Never trust the Chinese communist people.
there was no silicon in my rifle when I was with the army in syria.****INSERT TECHNOLOGY BASED ADVERTISEMENT***
Asia Asia Asia
Someone send this to the CCP
A lot of misinformation in this video. The US has had hypersonic missiles for years. There are several types of hyper sonic missiles.  To say China is ahead is a gross mischaracterization.
The key to a future in which the world is not ruled by a communist dictatorship is by only doing business with democratic nations. Bring manufacturing back to America and by America I'm talking about the continent.
Used to enjoy Johnny’s videos I just get a overwhelming feeling that he is just to far left
Don’t need sea transport for chips when they fit in your hand… fly over the lot of them!
Chinese are Chinese first… they send their students to the West … then 75% come back to deliver the knowledge that could not be developed in a communist ‘locked down’ society - Communism will always be behind, they’re like the tick on your ass when you go to free your mind camping with the kids… vermin…and cheats!
Ah yes, Bunny Suits in the FABS. I know people who have worked at Intel...apparently they work LOOOONG hours, and it sucks,  BIG time!
How do you do your infographics? They’re really cool plus the editing  - all important!
Moore’s law is not infinite…
There also a lot of Mainland Chinese born graduate students at the U.S. Universities who are in Computer Engineering and Computer Science. Mysteriously.
Stop Russia getting chips! Save MacDonalds in Taiwan!! 😂
@5:32 "transistors looked like this" Correction; that is a vacuum tube, the predecessor to the transistor.
Yea, you give Resident Biden credit for the Chip Wars, but you know dang well that it was President Trump that rang the alarm and starting the process of protecting US interests. Trump was right about microchips, and he was right about Russian oil. However, people like you will never admit it.
One bullet to shoot yourselves in the foot? Buckshot works much better you don't miss !
Getting chips just for military? that's silly
But the vintage camera does have silicon in it. Silicon dioxide is in glass
Does this channel support US hegemony?
that's nice, but what if you want to be a software professional and you don't know anything before hand?
Im an econ major and your videos truly helped me go from a D to a B in my class! Your way of explaining a subject is immaculate❤
Another important piece to mention is that the Dutch company ASML can't export the most advanced "magic laser" lithography machines to China. Even if China wanted to create their own chips at home they would not be as advanced as the chips the West uses.
Thank you for saying that China wants to invade Taiwan
Remember that Malaysian airlines going down? Some chip-makers were on that plane and the Rothschild family shot it down.
5:31 CORRECTION: what you’re showing here is the predecessor to the transistor called a vacuum tube. You have 1941 shown. The transistor was invented in 1947.  Great video. Thank you for what you do.
SERIOUSLY!!! OLD NEWS DUDE. ITS BEEN GOING FOR YEAR'S NOW.
Cold War vibes are indeed back, on a larger scale.
The Department of Commerce’s Export Administration Regulations is supposed to hinder the sale of commercial products to oversees countries that have dual applications to military applications especially if they’re hostile.
You are one of my new favorite channels
In my opinion, this is your best video yet! I learned so much in an engaging way.
Solo le copio la estrategia a Trump 😂😂
it's all just gone to absolute shit!
I hate life our whole entire country is fucked man!!
And they say there is food shortage
We didn’t need them before the microchips. No thank you. I don’t need it. Phone is fine but nothing past that for me.
When Ronald Reagan put the 100% tax on imports coming from Japan, he's literally doing PRECISELY what he said he'd do when he said "by ensuring our country's strength, while making sure everybody has more for themselves". How can you say he's abandoning his own morals and principles? By taxing Japanese chip imports, that thereby creates a supply and demand gap that gets filled right here IN HOME (domestic production), creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, leading to growth in our nation, which subsequently will spill over into the global market. At a minimum, at least do a khan academy course on macroeconomics before attempting to bash (arguably) one of the best presidents this country ever had by saying he abandoned his morals and lied, simply because he reversed the course of American dependency on Japanese semiconductors? Trump attempted to do the same, we all saw our economy begin to rise, then people like good Ole Johnny began to visualize Trump as their version of the anti-christ and got their panties bunched up because Trump made some "off-color" statements 20 years prior. And that's coming from someone that couldn't stand the guy at the beginning of 2016, now I look back and see all the incredible things he WAS TRYING to do for America, so even millionaires like Johnny Harris could have an even higher standard of living. Frankly, I think you should feel ashamed of yourself to bash a former president, let alone Ronald Reagan, especially after witnessing how he brought this country's economy back almost entirely from the dead (i.e., record inflation, 19%, prior to his inauguration)
This is fascinating but terrifying. The Cold War between the US and Russia was terrifying enough and now here we go again. This really shows the effects of greed and desire for wealth and power, not to mention the ineptness of the US government.   I have been to China and it’s plain to see that the powers that be over there don’t care a lot about their citizens. But they do care a lot about wealth from major corporations and their military.
I follow your channel, it’s one of the best for me and you give me me so much I’m not with the knowledge
In China 🇨🇳, there is a saying. “American government is stupid”
There's many facts that are wrong in this video, Japan was dumping chips in America and playing unfair, totally not a free market, which is why America responded the way they did, and Morris Chang wasn't a Taiwanese engineer, he was from mainland China, I recommend you read Chip Wars to get your facts straight
Thank you.
Humans are crazy
Do video about gujarat riot 2002
I can gauruntee that in the event of a chinese invasion all Taiwanese chip foundries would be utterly destroyed by the Taiwanese themselves.
Please do more “China bad, America good’ videos please!!!!
PODCAST: make it about geopolitical news and random info!!
Typical American who can't afford to lose. I don't have 5G because China stole it. China has hypersonic missiles because of American chips. I want to point out that hypersonic missiles don't need low nano chips. China can make 14nm chips stably by itself , if the yield rate is not considered, 7nm is also ok. This does not affect China's supersonic missiles at all, nor does it affect whether the United States can make supersonic missiles. If you always refuse to admit failure, spread wrong information, and believe it is true,  then America will decline.
THE SCALE OF THOSE CHIPS HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE
There is no country named Taiwan in the world.I think the real name is Republic of China.
Meh, life is probably better without it all. The quakers live more fulfilling lives.
When the chips act got passed and TSMC announced the investment in the US all i could think about was HOW none of the large Media outlets reported on this in the huge way this deserves. This is BIG.  EDIT: of course some reported, but I felt like delayed and without proper economic analysis.
Americans need to stop with the free market thingy. Such a thing never existed, does not exist and will never exist. The main and sole goal of capitalism is monopoly over a market.
Today's class, amazing...thank you Jonny Harris
DILLIGAF? What you don't see is that the PRC is influencing Australian politics in a way that weakens the citizens of Australia, no criticism of the PRC is allowed in Australian media OR on college campuses. Tasmania's wind farms have Chinese Ownership. New Zealand is weaker after Ardern's Chinese influenced gun ban. Canada is weaker now that Trudeau is banning guns. The Brits disarmed the people of Hong Kong after WW2 so they could NOT resist the armed invasion of the PRC. -don't give me that crap about treaties and top government agreements, the PEOPLE of Hong Kong are being renditioned to Mainland China for interrogation and prison.   Microchips? Ok, sure, the economy is a serious issue, but the relentless abuse and weakening of the private citizen is a PRC government mainstay and they are exporting it to the detriment of everyone who deals with them.   Surveillance, intimidation and the criminal abuse of law enforcement thugs and goons make for a terrified population.
@johnny Harris Now I understand why the New Nvidia GPUs are expensive
What Taiwan becomes another Afghanistan??
You seem to have forgotten to mention that the Dutch company of ASML also got a ban from our government with pressure from the USA to sell manufacturing equipment for 2nm wafers to China. However, for certain applications 5nm wafers are small enough. And they are most likely going to reverse engineer the machines to produce them.
Definitely the most educative YouTube channel I stumbled upon.
Awesome video! Great job man...!
If China can make hypersonic missiles using ,so called US based semiconductors,it's not so difficult for china to develop a full fledged microchip required for the untraceable missile🤖
The birth history of semiconductors can be traced back to the invention of the rectifier (AC-DC converter) in 1874. Decades later, Bardeen and Brattain at Bell Laboratories in the US invented the point-contact transistor in 1947, and Shockley invented the junction transistor in 1948.
They can't go but so small. Is this why they're now trying to work with some kind of element that's found in the ocean? Idk I'm asking
You're a little slow and you missed that  there's a few elephants in the room . China will hang itself if it even goes close to a blockade .
Where are silicones derived from?
And then the pandemic started
Thanks for covering this. Fabs are hands down the most complex manufacturing facilities in the world, and most people don't even know about them.
this and fusion, these are the wars to conquer the next era.
I see it like this: If China invades Taiwan they will fuck up the whole game. Which could be what they want/need to defeat the west. Imagine what would happen if the world's supplier got taken out and we the west aren't ready to film the gap fast enough they will get ahead just enough to become the actual Don dadas. I'm talking A.I mostly the nukes are just cool if America would try to jump in.  Seriously we are acting like oh nah they can't because they would lose this and that but damn bro they can if they feel like it. For example u wanna tell me the Chinese couldn't round up like 50 of the best engineers that survive Taiwans invasion and torture the shit out of them and their families for the knowledge?  They doing that stuff already with the uygurs for none really so I ain't really that sure they couldn't operate the factorys. Considering they are aware of their population problem and stuff they will know they need to move soon or they wont get another shot. Plus they have the mad rocket men in their pocket to. All together I'd say we are going to see the next big 💥  within 10 to 15 years and I ain't that sure how it's going to end. History repeates itself literally. WW2 jap vibes.
Finally someone is talking about this
Thanks!
Silly Can Chips 😊
Great video Johnny. Love it
As soon as you started blaming Ronald Reagan and making it Political, you lost all credibility, with me and it appears several thousand others. His move at the time made sense when you put it into perspective. How could he have known it would come to where it is today? He wanted AMERICAN companies to profit, not another nation, thus the tax on the most valuable product to the USA at that time. Dumb as hell bro
Hi nick, im daniel lol😂
Grate video, nicely explained
Time to Rage Unionize
Economic interdependence is the only reason China is where it is today
Needless to say Johnny did an amazing job on this, as he does an amazing job on every vid!!!
I love how he talks about TREASON so flippantly, --U.S technology and chip manufacturers allowing our ENEMY to purchase tech that will allow them to gain the upper hand!!!  We as Americans should of never been put in this compromised situation, this screams corruption at all levels, and those responsible need to face the same consequences that they would in China if they wronged that Govt!  I can understand if someone somewhere was smart enough to engineer chips with sabotaging or back door technology, so that when they use the high technology we are stupid enough to sell them ( to use against us in a coming conflict) it backfires on them.   How ignorant are we at this point collectively as a people that we just allow the big tech giants and the military industrial complex to become completely compromised and usurp our power as a people, even so far as deciding what I can and cannot say on a platform such as this one!  Must be nice--sell out your country and own the tech they would fight you with and then control the platforms so that what you say and think about it is controlled!  And all while the enemy dumbs down our populous with fentanyl and TicToc content to help them snooze!! When you snooze you loose folks!!!!  Wake TF up!!!
Dude, you get WAY too many views.
Gotta say, just found your channel today and I love it so far. Concise, informative, and hitting so many different topics.   It’s a person with chronic intellectual curiosity’s dream channel.
We made rocks count using lightening.
Some thing I don't recall being mentioned in your video:  China's recent rhetoric seems to have been to move more toward a nationalistic view of its interactions on the international stage.  For example, creating islands in the South China Sea and a few years ago they started cracking down on foreigners in the country.
Make a video about zelensky
Love the information and combination of humor and twist and turns along the way, thanks for sharing!
the science behind microchips explains why the chinese word for computer is electric brain
There's an A.I. war as well yeah!?
Fantastic video! Very well put together.
All this time I thought the USA was protecting Taiwan out of its goodness and kindness
US owning patents to advanced UV lithography manufacturing is why the US has so much pressure in this market.
And there goes the renewable energy. Remember wind and solar require silicone and most of that comes from China. We invented solar in the U.S., and China perfected the manufacturing.
Thank you for such an educational video. Excellent job! Can you explain about big firms like NVIDIA? Is it no longer one of the SC giants after the downfall?
There is no way the Chinese navy will blockade Taiwan Johnny. The sea is the domain of the United States and the Chinese navy is nowhere near being able to challenge the United States navy. The US would not allow Chinese ships to stop their ships - military or civilian
This is tasty, but it’s like popcorn, not real food.  For example, the explanation of why semiconductor technology was revolutionary was way too superficial, missing the key point which is its extraordinary scalability because of lithography (printing) instead of micromachining (carving). The concept of transistors and the ability to do computation based on circuits was not revolutionary at all, because that had become well understood before semiconductor.   Just like people can’t expect to live healthy on popcorn, I hope people are not getting their technological education and geopolitics education from videos like this.   Anyway, excellent presentation, helpful as mass education.
Let’s just put one of our most important factories right next to our biggest enemy. Seems good lol 😳😵‍💫😵🤦🏻‍♀️
AHH!!   I absolutely love these videos but every few weeks they cause me to have a melt down. I'm looking out my windows expecting to see Chinese tanks rolling down my street. American citizens are asleep at the wheel. China, in the literally sense is waging war with us in every possible way they can in scales small enough that won't unite us. I do find little comfort at least our government has the sense to ring the alarms. I'd even be cool with China over taking the USA economically if they'd stay to their own but we all know how that will go. I fear greed by American corporations will likely prevail and be the end of us.
Magic metal just highlights that the only difference between magic and science is not what it does but how much you know about it. Don't know how it works? Call it magic.  Is that a witch or a chemist?
Clever hipster :)
Just wow 😮, thank you 🙏🏾
That's really cool TSMC is building a FAB in the US so we don't have to cut off advancement from Taiwan. I wonder if China wants to invade Taiwan more now because of that though.  ∆∆∆Haha I made that comment before I watched the Nancy Pelosi segment or end of the video.
If wars and weapons, hence murder and death are at the root of progress, what is this progress’s real name? Barbarism. Brutality. Regression.
Incredible video man!  I love that when I need to know what is going on in the world today, I can trust Johnny Harris to present that information to me both unbiased and understandably. Keep it up man! This is what journalism should be.
Very interesting I’m glad you made this video
Man, this is huge! Thank you for the great video!
Geopolitical bargaining chip 😂😂😂
Just don't take it , personally you understand
China is kind of screwed in 10 different ways.... so no need to worry about them really....
Not my war I’m waiting for the clone wars
This is the first video of yours that I've come across.. I want to know everything about your cameras and equipment! The quality is fantastic and I felt like I was watching my TV not my laptop ha. Brilliant content too, hoping there's more of the same on your channel!
“I’m now going to eat a Reese’s peanut butter cup from Trader Joe’s” 😂😂
In the early 2000's I worked at micron, talk about a sweat factory that didn't pay crap.
At this point doing any business with China is doing business with the CCP. And unless you’re into ethnic cleansing, organ harvesting and general authoritarianism, that’s not a good look
One stakeholder is missed here , the most important one for that matter. Where does the Silicon comes from? Africa? Congo?
Silica is what separated man from ape. It was in fact the first weapon. A mere stone. Some apes got the idea to sharpen a stone and utilize it for simple things. Ironically enough in the glass age it revealed a whole new property.
The music and momentum is soooooooooo goooooddd
Well this is better than a war you CAN see. Because when average civilians see a war, people dies.
Hey Johnny, nice videos! I'm curious about the Chinese New Year, why is it different from the rest of the world and what's with the animals (Year of the Rabbit?) How do they pick the animals
If we had subsidized the industry from the beginning we wouldn’t have to be laying out so much now.
Duhhh. They just now figured out valuable chip technology will be used against us?
lol I mean this is magic
is silicon metal tho? cuz last i checked its more like glass
10 of the largest manufacturers of micro chips are in South Korea, Taiwan and the USA? Not China? Is this the war we cant see or the war that is blatantly obvious 😅
Gene therapy nanotechnology according to the WEF is the fourth Industrial Revolution.
I used to work for a company that started the LiDAR tech, Velodyne. The greedy people in charge thought it was a good idea to move manufacturing to China. Now, the Chinese can make their own Lidars and started their own LiDAR companies  🤣
American can't stand to wear a mask let alone a bunny suit in a sterile work environment.  Asians on the other hand wear mask 24/7, so they are able to wear the bunny suit all day.
18:32 -One can see why this looks like an injustice from China’s perspective. Taiwan is recognized by the UN as a territory of China, so the Taiwanese chip manufacturing industry that China is so dependent on should (from China’s perspective) rightfully be part of China’s domestic economy.
Did US actually put a 100% tax on the Japanese back in 87? Damm...
Love 👍👏
Soy boy
This is like the cold war where the US was so far up ahead until the USSR got the technology  from the US. Now Russia is ahead of the nuclear games.
never stop the paper stuff, love it xDD
America has lost.  Fertility rates at an all time low and will keep going down, USA population is 331 MILLION, China Population is  1.4 BILLION
the editing plus story telling technique = dope documentary short.
Taiwan is China only US doesn't recognize that fact!
Meanwhile the Netherlands: Doesn't matter. We will win at the end.
I work at a factory that makes parts for the OEMs. They have had a shortage of chips for almost a year maybe even longer. All our customers orders have significantly declined.
Hey man! I really appreciate your content and have me introduced to a lot of stuff I never knew about but lately it's kinda starting to become a little jarring I felt like skipping the video in the video half way... Maybe this will help your team to address some problems with the view count lately. But anyways keep doing the good work and fun/entertainment is key when converting information is the goal.
I think after Ukraine, Taiwan knows they need a deterrent.. and they have the tech and money to get it, even without US support. Maybe even better without support- the less people know, the better.
The real currency of power is wealth and has always been wealth because everybody is on sale. It's just a matter of price. The microchip war for the military advancement? Not really. Most of these military contractors who are building the advanced weapon and defense systems still use chips that are built in quite old process nodes. Because they do not require overwhelming processing power to control a missile. What makes microchips so important is the consumers. Everybody wants the cutting edge technology. Everybody wants the new fancy phones, cars, computers or whatever. China needs to develop their own semiconductors because the big brother (CCP propaganda machine) wants to prove Chinese people the way of the CCP is better than anything else. And also they make a buttload of money doing so.
so you are telling me, we landed to the moon with only like 4KB, but it takes hours to download a game, in the modern day.
希望世界和平
so to sum up this is a clusterf*ck
Doesn't speaking about Silicon offend actors and 'influencers' ?
Usa needed to make chips in usa from day one
Hi Johnny would you do a doc on the Vatican  missing girl Emanuel orlandi.
Usa as usual been an asshole
Fabs are fab. Sorry I had to.
Well I wonder who started open trade huh I could of been the big guy you know the.. the thing
28:51 Ah yes, adversaries should pay well attention on Youtube since many retired generals, expert think tanks, etc. such will literally teach you how to destroy them or screw them over, it's a gold mine on self-suicide.
Please learn how to tell a story. It’s hard, I know.
China is good at mass producing stuff cheap, but really not good at technology even if one might think so. For example only within last 10 years or so have China been able to 100% make a ballpoint pen - they used to import the ball-thingy from Germany and only relatively recently are able to manufacture it themselves. Anything slightly more advanced coming from China is more or less only assembled there, while chips etc. are imported. Also, the Communist rule ("with Chinese characteristics") does not foster innovation in people, so stealing IP is pretty much the rule there to get new tech.
Reece's peanut butter cups....
GREAT ONE
It's a wonder how the US hasn't lost yet. I mean you got certain Presidents and maybe certain Senators on the Intel Committee leaving classified docs all over the place reading for the taking by adversarial spies.
I found this very informative! Thanks! 👍
These chips are making me thirsty.
aint nobody gonna use no damn communist chips
Hi Johnny, could you do some reporting of the systemic lack of funding research and care the global medical community has treated ME/CFS. And how this systemic failure has now translated to Long Covid
There was a documentary made about this back in 1998. It was called Small Soldiers.
What a huge ego to display your face striking a pose like a model in your thumbnail of a video so serious. Seems a bit like an inflated ego problem
For a socdem, Johnny Harris isn't making a great point for why we need capitalism in his social democratic utopia. It seems like nationalizing certain industries has done China wonders and brought them ahead of Taiwan who just managed to buy themselves a shield with their state funded companies. It's almost like social capitalism is just an appeasement mechanism to convince the US government to get with the program. The US is bringing a donkey to a horse race (while the elephant is running backwards). Capitalism is not needed at all for the "economic interdependence" that Harris toats. A state run industry can choose to foster economic interdependence for the diplomatic and strategic purposes and still remain independent for security purposes. Not great CIA propaganda 3/10. The boss is not pleased. Do better Harris.
Only in Ohio
HI NICK😂
Nothing says freedom better than banning your own citizens from employment with the world's 2nd economy.
You believe we went to moon?
26:16 oh noo
Sounds like a summary of Chip War by Chris Miller
Two related concepts, in google-able essays: "The Case for Chip-Backed Dollars" about using chips as our currency, to gain a permanent A.I. lead and strong trade position after the petro-dollar collapses "Robot War Number One" describing how we are currently spiraling into a global war of attrition, waged by soldiers+robots - in "Putin's Love Affair" there is an update on this concept.
Teşekkürler efendim beğeni bıraktım
Isn't this called competition . What the US tells us is at the very hart of the US. Why is it called war?
A podcast would be amazing. Hopefully, it comes to fruition 😬
Nice vid
interesting point on china making super missile using US EDA software. consider this: the bullets fired from fancy US firearms were propelled by guess what? gun powder. take a guess whose tech gun powder is. don't want to argue but china rarely invaded anyone in the history. the US? well, over 4/5 of its less than 300 years history was about raising wars. there's no right or wrong for super powers. they are all about brainwashing their people for ruling and national stability
All of that "tech" is useless without electricity! destroy the grid and all else will fail in short order..!!  so, no chips are cool! but it's not real power! or a safeguard.
Well, it’s here
👍👍
Let me 'sabotage' how Johnny Harris OVERREACT to the superiority of microchips by stating that heavy military equipment and doom's day military weapons can be robustly build using relatively low resolution microchips. Russia and China can comfortably make them anyhow. Ahahahah! 🤣🤣🤣
Great stuff as always Johny, thanks
So do you start with a team to make these videos? Like if I wanted my own channel. How do I find a team?
Remember Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370? A bunch of the passengers are working in the semiconductor industry and heading toward Beijing.
Really good, earned a sub
You opened my minde dude thank you!
China has learned how to make semiconductors and will be producing its own semiconductors in a few years. Unlike the US China lacks allies. The US is beginning to economically invest in Asia and Africa. The economic dimension of the competition is equally important as the military dimension.
21:09 we are literally stupid with greed
the real reason why the us doesnt want chin a to have chips is because  it would make china n o longer reliant on western technology and be a leader. they can dominate the tech industry market and outcompete germany, us and taiwan in making phones and com merical tech. ikt will make china the most powerful country and that is the real reason why the Us cannot allow it.
. if you done your research, China doesn't need advanced chips for military as they al.ready can easily p;rovide all the military chips gthey need, that are don't need to be that advanced. they need really advanced chips because of future techilogy like ai and automation and supercompute
Realist professors taking major W’s across international relations classes everywhere recently
The usa will lose hegemony no matter what they do the dollar hegemony will end too
As the fab are all based on a small island next to China what happens if china invades no chips
I dont believe for a second that the US was unaware of CCP's development of a hyper-sonic missile system. The US is infamous for manufacturing issues to react to. My bet is that the US will shortly unveil similar missile tech, and this "being taken by surprise" is really the rationale for taking such drastic steps against China regarding chip tech.
Thanks for putting this together in a understandable way and why they are important.
You should be more careful when it comes to making computer-brain or computer-mind analogies. Computational theory of mind is one possible theory in the field of philosophy of mind, though it has its problems.
It cannot be overstated but very few people understand how advanced and resilient and resourceful the Chinese government and people are especially with reverse engineering just about anything's especially tech
I love how the entire video is talking about chips and economic war with china super serious stuff and then Johnny tops it all off with “now I’m gonna eat this Reece’s peanut butter cup from Trader Joe’s”. Honestly a funny palate cleanser. Another banger of a video Johnny!
Taiwan being so close to China, is why we are making our own FABS.  Cant block chips, if we are making them in house.
This is fantastic, great work!
Taiwan is not a nation
Thank you for explaining the dynamics- it pisses me off when politicians obscure their intentions with words like “protect our friends and family free trade for the wold American jobs” bullshit
Very well done. I'm subscribed.  Your delivery is impressive.  God bless
If you look at your corner of the world unbiased the most logical answer is war.  But we know war is bad, so the most obvious path is likely the one we don't want to take.  I get that the US is scared but so is china. You both need to find a better solution to this problem.  I personally believe a joint military venture where both sides get the next technology upgrade and apply it to their commercial industries instead of fighting would be the best way to go.   But I don't think either side really wants peace. There is always one person who wants to take the easy way out.
For those interested, the smallest size mentioned suffers from the electrons quantum tunneling across soooo there not sure practical. Can't have two right next to eachother
Once the US fabs are online, what happens to Taiwan? Then China sets up it's own  version of TSMC. The advanced software and chip designs will leak across the net to China, the probllem for China will be: Are the advanced software and chip designs for real?
Asml is not magic...
Since Biden's presidency, everything is f***d up
The first half is basically Taiwan is stealing Usa citizens jobs.
You should talk to the people you interview for your investigations that you do to get to know their personal opinions rather than the public opinions that they support. Now that would be a podcast
It is a war for world domination.
Where can I find the background music at 23:20?
Ccp needs to stop stealing what other people had to work hard for, uk,
🤣 because we will pretend Britain and the EU is not our competition either   Welcome to the developed community   America is in competition economically with China  Britain  the EU etc.
Was US intelligence really caught off guard with that Chinese missile test? I highly doubt it - I'm sure they had some idea - and in terms of them not being able to track it let alone attack it? I highly doubt that even more - I'm sure US Intelligence/Military have tech and weapons that the public is not privy to.   Probably gave that misleading info to news outlets since its more clickbait/newsworthy to say that US Intelligence got caught with their pants down vs actually knowing whats up
Your video was pretty spot on, you and your team have done a really job of putting the chip conflict in layman's terms just sad it was politicized.
Why doesn't the US government just arrest the CEO of the companies who are selling the information to China? They never go after the rich who are going against their own country
Well done. Thank you.
WEF SPARS PANDEMIC  SHEDDING NEUROLOGY  GEMATRIA CABAL  DO TRUE RESEARCH STOP BEING ADRAID TO TELL THE TRUTH ! DAVOS
In China, business and military is kinda blurry line, overseen by the state... LMAO Johnny. Do you mena unlike the US or France or the UK. Are you even serious? I don't mean to slam you or anything but come on, have you really think this through and wrote it down and filmed it without batting an eye??? wow so sad.
You see Johnny, when you like at past 80 years, I wonder which country should be called aggressive. Your video are really good, minus the propagandized american anti-chinese brain of yours. The rest is superb and interesting.      Just let's put the video this way: Bully consumerist America only protected Taiwan because they bowed to the all mighty american power and their greedy industry. How does capitalism is doing in America by the way? For the weak and poor people? Think harder really.
Semiconductor chips cannot be just “tiny pieces of metal” because they’re… semiconducting and not metallic lol
This started a long time ago , it’s why Pelosi has her Bs trip to Taiwan , it’s a huge source of tension for US and China , we have been fighting over Taiwan for semiconductors and rare earths , this has far from “just begun “
Wish we could steer away from putting humans like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates on a pedestal.  Billionaires are just humans, the real work were done by the thousands of employees.  Let's say Microsoft and Apple instead.
THANK YOU SO MUCH! GOD BLESS......
The same wanna be hip wool hat wearing vloggers screamed for four years how Trump was racist against China. Now that Biden is re-upping on Trumps starting point it’s all good. Until you can be honest about the orange trash panda and the drooling septuagenarian currently living in the White House how can you be taken seriously.
0:46 Why is his hand so tiny??
❤🙏☯️
A matter of time until China figures it out, if they haven't already
Please make some videos on INDIA in the position of their in Geopolitics. Btw a very good and informative video
Isn't it wierd thinking that some brilliant minds in our society in the past has made such an impact on our everyday lives even after their death. In fact, think about how many 'people' did not get to exist to make so many breakthroughs in science that are yet to come
I really hope things work out in 2023. Just straight up.
american companies need to make profit which is understandable for why they are selling china their software and chip design. i just have to assume my country's military (usa) has their own incredible, advanced chip software and design that doesnt enter the marketplace, and is only for usa military applications
The USA needs to pay for college students that promise to work in the semiconductor sector for ten years. If they fail to hold up their end they pay back the Government for college.
Another excellent vlog!
Trust me your career will thank you. They paid me 10 grand to say that, a cost they will pass on to their customers. But trust me I will say anything for mon.. er... your career will thank you
It's the UN's fault and Bush/Clinton/Biden/Obama for supporting the "brave NWO". Corporations seem evil but they are just following the money and can only do what the government allows them to do. Stop blaming everyone but the UN. I keep hearing it's the greedy corporations, or the joos, or it's because of white nationalists, it's always everything but the UN.
I know I’m probably insane, but I can’t help but believe that China really did create COVID on purpose.  😅 damn
I knew it. You’ve always had a *chip* on your shoulder, Johnny.
Why don't we Unite the hole Word ?  Is it that Hard ?   cuz, in a word where we, are all united..  We would have less limitations, regarding almost everything. We would have in some decades, only one Currencie, we would one day have less language barriers.  It would be a little bit hard at the begin.. But with the building trust, we could have more and more cooperations between countries..  IF WE UNITED THE WHOLE WORD For shure wars of all kinds would one day end..
Hey! Quite informative, great efforts,  it would be great if the 33min video length is cut to some 22min .
this is next level entreteinment
I am a proud Taiwanian lives in USA.  US needs to help Taiwan now and fast. China/Russia cannot invade other countries.
The Cold War never truly left as the PRC continued fighting hybrid warfare while pretending they would be nice. How'd that work out? Genocide and Totalitarianism persist in China today yet we don't call them completely out like we say we would to anyone since the end of WW2.  Regardless of baseline ideology, combating a slave power like the CCP controlled PRC is paramount to a free and prosperous world.
the ironical thing is when the biggest seller stops selling chips to the biggest buyer will leg whole industry behind, insufficient R&D funding as well.
at the end of the day US still depends on china for manufacturing of the samrtphones and computer coz manufacturing is cheap and easy in china
Dutch firm Philips actually funded TSMC in the beginning, they owned 50% in the beginning.
That's why its so important to buy as many high quality American Made vintage appliances as you can. These items will outlast your lifetime.
I feel for you Johnny.  I work for the U.S. Dept of Commerce, in the Bureau of Industry & Security.  Watching your brain melt at 23:45 reading updates to 15 CFR was very relatable.  This is only a small fraction of my work and yet it dominates so much of my offices time and resources.
Too little, too late.
NOW TODAY I UNDERSTOOD WHY RAJKUMAR SAID THIS DIALOGUE IN THE "TIRANGA" MOVIE, 'MESILE UDDAOGE KAISAI, ISKE FUSE CONDUTER TOH HUMARE PASS HAI' , ANYONE FROM INDIA?
People just can’t live peacefully even they know their full life span is less than a century
TSMC made a bad bet! We're doing this to China, not because they did anything wrong, but because they're better than we are. The West is done & the effect on us will be that we're going to get ALL of the evil things we've done to others done to us. The goal should be to get the BEST from anywhere so that it benefits mankind. We don't believe in that because we need to be the sole dictator of the world.
Taiwan is a great country!  Keep an eye on China, Turkey, Russia, and my home country of the USA.
Really wat is ur income.....make a video....of the you tubers income....
"*Dear computer scientist people, this is...". Yes, super reductionist but you did it in an acceptable way. Good job. By the way, great video, as usual. Thanks!
Keep in min that EVEN THOUGH TSMC AND iNTEL ARE MAKING NEW FABS IN THE US THESE FABS ARE ALREADY GOING TO BE OUTDATED AS THEY WONT PRODUCE THE LATEST  PROCESS NODES.
This explains why Brazil is getting in the middle of this with the Niobium chips…
5000 years ago, There goes China fighting the flood,2000 years ago, there goes China fighting The hun，100 years ago, there goes China fighting the colonists，I'm just very curious what will China fight 5000 years later
Its prophesy..  China wins this war, then uses A.I.  to  control of the world population where you can not even say a word against the Governing State.
Decades ongoing now Taiwan business man who broke away from Texas instruments
Thanks!
Hahahaha funny how the west forced China to Open Up for freue trade and nö China teaching US free trade
The U.S. will benefit greatly if they make Puerto Rico the new Taiwan in terms of micro industry
I drive past the new Intel semiconductor plant in ohio everyday on the way to work.
You 're more a patriot representing your government interests & SupEriOrityyy than an independent 'journalist' caring for the world peace and freedom.. Don't let out of your mind that YoUr patents are timely limited, and that ALL 'your' achievements are actually based on previous a.o. technological advancements of other civilizations, so have some free wind for others to build on yours and make humanity go on.. 🤔
1:15 that’s me, when I’m trying to sell few little things on OfferUp to buy some more silicon. 😅
the u.s.a. recogniced taiwan as being a part of china, so in their eyes there would be no invasion. the hypersonic missile (<- funny name shall it miss?) came from tech-sharing with russia, well certain kinds of friendly preassure on russia which was growing more dependent on the chinese market. jumped/skipped/hopped trough the video.  no worries , you even got philips in there. nice one. carry on.  👍
Thanks
So does it mean that Huawei CPUs are manufactured in China but made by US design and equipment?
Truly disappointed that even you follow the typical American nationalistic geopolitical bs. Why don't you check your own videos, it is the US who surrounds their military around the world constantly provoking new enemies and dictating everyone how they should run their own countries.  Even the Tainwaese themselves don't want Americans meddling with their issues, just look at their last election!
There is no chip in my refrigerator. 😁 I just asked him and he said "No, there is no chips inside myself. 😋
This was also when many other manufactured products were moved to being manufactured in china. BAD IDEA.
Reminds me of Micheal Scott's China, China, China!
If you didn't know, Israel is the most technology advanced country in the world and the most advanced producer of IC's. Including Software / Elbit Systems etc...
Just wait till quantum computation becomes available
Damn great video, Had to sub.
we know where chips go, We do need you to show us a pile of electronics. EVERYBODY knows what a chip is. Who are you dumbing this down for, a kindergartner? We dont need you to tell us what chips are for.
4:47 skip ad
Oh c’mon… not fair to this one   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiniX-rly1c
Wow, I just like how you make politics and economics so interesting. I'd like to see a video on what's your take, and the facts, on BRICS soon🤔🧐, but yeah thanks man✌
China using our chips in a possible war is like the U.S and other countries using the Mauser design for rifles against Germany. It a use of assets available knowledge. When dealing you never know if the part you provide will be used for harm but must consider it’s possibility.
Curious you didn’t mention Neongas & Ukraine!  But truly a brilliantly made vid. Wp sir wp
Come here to find out how the world really turns.
Almost as if there's a group of persons in control who are neither geographically or nationally bound?
How will the US borrow money from China?
this video correlates well with davos
Great video
Majority of our daily use appliances are made from silicone but most importantly butt implants are also made from this wondrous material.
So funny. All the world is a free market as long as USA benefits from it 😂 When other get advantage over it, WE take our toys and go home 😅
I loved the context of microchips in recent geopolitical activity.
USA and their one-china policy makes things weird. If they consider China and Taiwan as the same then... But they don't of course but they still have that policy.
Your videos are absolutely amazing, you and your team have done a excellent job of creating a unique and yet modern and interesting way of doing journalism. It's simply amazing.
US must be careful not to end up supporting another fascist regime . Chine is worse but India is almost there with China.
Going to moon...more like Nevada desert
One thing you forgot - China already has the knowledge to operate FABS They are given a lot of Intel by Israel. The US is compromised by "best ally" and has been forever. State of the art tech is constantly handed over by them to China.
01:50 Now Nick has to rearrange the office🤣
just FYI, because it will take awhile for the world to catch up, INDIA has more population than CHINA, good to keep in mind.
To a certain extent, yea.. this vid is very pro US and not considering, that  china have their own chip making. Just not the 4nm and below. 7nm china can be self reliant. what is happenning to china is also ongoing in US. US cannoy survive if their military industry goes down and their military mights dwindle. No war = no money for US. Simple... technology should be shared together. We need to someday get ourselves away from earth before dooms day occur. China is looking at that direction. But US? they are only looking to end humanity. Dont be a hypocrit....
Brilliant!! Absolutely brilliant!
Australia is keeping china running right now
Americans being Americans, they sell everything to china, after that they don't know who china goes so far on technology ahahahah
I get hype when you post a video bro
Super interesting, thank you!
Watch this again. This guy equates Geo-Politics to Violence & Power. 🤔🤔  & I 💯% agree.
Nicely done, Johnny. An issue at the forefront of importance in our current geopolitical situation.
Could you make a video about the protests/murders in IRAN? I dont understand too much, and u explain s good! Anyways, u put in alot of work no matter what the topic so cheers to that!
i really appreciate all your hard work and research, bravo!!!!
Yes you should start a podcast, but nothing to involved. Focus on your main vids.
Try to make small videos
Who cares if China builds their military?  Are you serious?  What are you just a paranoid?  America is huge and powerful.  You don't see all the other countries acting all scared of China.
Johnny please make a vedio on Babari masjid massacre led by Indian prime minister Modi... and investigate how and why  uk and us is rooting for him🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯
Talk about Poor Andrew tate.and did the illuminate arrested him because he choose Islam.?
And that reminds me how ridiculous and stupid putler's war in Ukraine is. Russia, recently one of the greatest powerful countries (in terms of history), is left ultimately far behind technologically and mentally. Desperately trying to get back on stage, but being not able to offer any goods for the new world of today. To the world of silicon, neuron-networks AI, computer science, etc. Nursing home of old farts relying on a bunch of oil under their asses and 30 years believing that this will be forever. Throwing all they have, including all the people to send out to the stupidest war, armed with rusted rifles from the early 80s. And the funniest part is that that action was the last nail in the coffin of russian dev. All high-tech and development companies of any size left this Stone Age country in two waves of migration (straight after the war began, and the final one after the mobilization was declared). I was in the first one. Such a pathetic folk.  Slava Ukraine!
Is there a microchip gap?
do American's call them microfries?
No superpower is getting their hands on my microchip
WEF shill
Love you men hahah hahah best videos  bro best videos on YouTube by far.keep the great work up
India🇮🇳 is also coming into the game with foxconn-vedaanta investing $20billion to start semiconductor manufacturing
gekoloniseerd
U saved my day!! Never laughed so much this month.
Johnny’s videos are really good. He’s just such a gaylord
Im sorry, as an electrical engineering student - so many mistakes has bee n said during the video..
Good vide. Just small mistakes, Si is not a metal. Yes its very abundant in the earth's crust, but you can't just use any sand, at least not yet, not at cost. Second the same people who caused golbalism and exported the "heavy manufacturing" especially dirty manufacturing overseas, they are the same who are now telling you that the only safe globalism is if, like you said US is the kingpin and other countries are its slaves. The problem aswell is that at least half of the population said Trump would start a war by doing exactly what Biden did and does. Also Biden's family had a stake in all those facturies, they got rich of your ppl loosing jobs, they criticised the guy who did this forst as a racist and xenophobic and now you pat them on the back for doing the same. So Im not sure are you anti-war or only anti-war when its not US causing it? You make great videos and lots of good info but somehow you always cheerlead US foreign policy. My point proven with the coment on natural gas...
I never knew this tiny devices have so many transistors and logic gates
Funny side note; the map here shows no boundaries between India and Pakistan and effectively renders both as one united country. Meanwhile Bangladesh still has its borders. So looks like India and Pakistan united and left Bangladesh to do its thing 😅
Cool, thank you. 🌴😎🤙🏾
Good watch.  But if you think Biden is doing anything but crapping his pants and getting lost, you’re really in la la land.  No love for the real admin and president who actually put all of the moves vs China into motion?   We are already at war, and it’s a lot more than just the chips.  Fossil fuels, farming, culture, chips and so on……Would have been a lot better without forced propping up Peter Pedo.  The “big guy” has been making too much money selling out the US to China, you’re making it sound like he knows he’s alive and where he’s at.
This clearly explains the GPU storage that occurred last 2-3 years
Well then what can I do to help us win?

Johnny Harris, HBO of youtube😉. Change my mind.
Incredible!  #subscribed
So awesome that you give credits to the entire team that deservedly be recognized. Looking forward for more contents.
Deeply ironic. I wonder how the USSR felt when companies trading as fronts for the US military purchased titanium to built the skunkwork SR71, so the  US could spy on the USSR?
Great job Johnny. Your report are far more intriguing and mind provoking than most national tv news report.
12:25 that was unexpected and hilarious haha
very informative video. Although SV is a short drive away, from my house, I  never thought to wonder why it's called semiconductors
Wake up. China already have everything. They started to produce their own graphic cards. Not yet so powerful as AMD or nVidia but they will get there at some point.
This is why flight MH370 went missing. It carried a team of microchip developer smaller than anyone in the world has ever done.
XD honestly I'd find it hilarious if china decides to blockade with warships, cause china has no warships lol. 😂 sure they have a lot of people but they have zero actual military. They are literally ranked 5th. Which is terrible considering they are the richest super power, with the most people.
The best video found so far explaining Why Semiconductor Chips are so important!
No printed maps?!
United States of America : We are the good guy and China is bad guy  United States : Went on to kill millions around the world directly or indirectly by proxy in Middle East, Vietnam, Ukraine, Latin America etc. Have military bases around the world and US marines committing violent and sex crimes in Korea and Japan  China : Goes around the world trade and invest and built infrastructures in foreign countries at cheaper rates than the West and offer cheaper loans than IMF
Biden emplimented those restrictions/sanctions on China because of their big hissyfit over Pelosi's visit. the Trump; now Biden administration made an error: most things are made with medium microchips. cars, for instance, are made with medium chips. the sanctions are going to hurt China, but you have to remember that China [as a country] was probably going to cease to exist by the end of this decade anyway. their birth-rate is the worst in the world. they aren't advanced enough to move up the value-added chain. they're pretty much done trying to compete as a super-power.
What a weird video. Showing China as the "big aggressive" nation is truly bizarre, compared to the US. And doing a whole deep dive on current chip technology without mentioning that the tech is at end of life is also super strange. Plus no mention that the US is trying to strongarm the Dutch into stopping sales with China, like the bullies they are. Just weird, man.
Windows use silicate
Mexico will provide them chips
You had me liking this video till you had biden on talking tough as if  he wasn't just reading the teleprompter lmao  then Pelosi 😭 they are weak an controlled by others I want to see others who think for themselves again!
Probably one of the best videos I’ve watched, and easy to understand what he is saying
China was just finally able to engineer a ballpoint pen. AFTER DEVOTING 4X YEARS TO DOING JUST THAT. You think they're remotely close to be able to manufacture anything close to the u.s ? Hellllllll noooooooo. They can assemble but they cannot produce . That's 2x huge differences
Wait… did he say scaler would make you level up or would it make you level up?
DF-17 hypersonic missile, like other Chinese military equipments, doesn't rely on US chip technologies. Do your homework.
OLD NEWS. I ALREADY KNOW.
not joining a mega liberial, sorry, saw Biden there taking credit for something he did not do!
america is evil
Johnny just needs to start tying his hair into braids so he looks just like Greta Thunberg. I'm mean, they're almost identical already, but he needs that finishing touch.
India, China and Russia will be the new global hedgmons in the next decade
Why don’t you do a video about the WEF in Davos ?
so wise , Thank You
Meanwhile India laughing at the corner..
Johnny your explanation of what a chip is, is the simplest, most clear, most rememberable one yet. Asante sana 🇰🇪 when you come to Nairobi, Kenya I demand that you stay at my house.
The US government is desperate to maintain its number spot. The Chinese will obviously respond.
Silicon is not Beetlejuice. You can't just say it three times and it appears.
H went hard in the beginning for no damn reason.
28:51: Xi Jinping be like lemme take notes
*The Silicon Age*  All my life I have had a fascination for the "life" that grows in places and things created by humans. Literally artificial life, not sentient yet, but alive in its own right.  I dream of a future where we can explore the universe through artificial life, explore reality through artificial intelligence and live in a new forest full of trees, plants and microorganism, but not (or not just) of biological origin but with so much more computing power than biological life that we surpass all limits.
What would keep other countries from getting them from 🇺🇸, and sell them for extra to 🇨🇳?
Yall really think China wants Taiwan for 5nm chips??? 😂 SMIC can already fab 7nm by stacking, and military tech and others need only 28-14 nm 😂 China is already capable bro (looking at Huawei’s advanced Kirin chip); TSMC is not even important in potential conflict (US politicians keep hyping this company) 😂. Istg US is really shooting itself in the foot
But they can't even produce their own ball point pen tips. 🤔
IT BEGAN IN AUSTRALIA MANY DECADES AGO THIS IS PRINCESS PEACH AND IMPEACHMENT...PAW AND ORDER INCLUDED YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH THIS AND+AMEN AND GFY
With climate changes and the important decline of biodiversity, it result surely in what some calls a global polycrisis. Super informative vid, and fun to watch despite the topic. Thanks!
Well I'm glad that America's Administration shutdown all the parties involved from selling out Americ's Technology to our biggest foreign enemy.  They shouldn't have been allowed to do it in the first place - Period!...
US government did the work that wake up Chinese businesses and engineers that Chinese hard to promote for many years. People feel cozy to rely on US technology and purchase it including HUAWEI.
I thought taiwan was its own country ?
Way, way too long and watered down. Hello, we all have ADHD now, remember? LoL not laugh out loud, figure it out.
SKIP SKIP SKIP 2:51 -4:42 ( non sense scam)
🎯🎯🎯……
communist china , will never be a superpower...
TSMC is building fabs in AZ, more than likely to keep themselves from being affected by Chinese intervention.
Only CHINA ❤ Zero respect to USA
wow
Please add LEO BRON, he lost his main thanx 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Just curious why you didn't give credit to Trump for Intels FAB in Ohio?
Greed, money, insecurity. They will end humanity before we know it.
2:05, 10:09
In the 80s the same happened with the USA vs Japan. The 1993 financial crisis was a big factor in the demise of the Japanese computer industry.
Anyone know what the song at https://youtu.be/k_zz3239DA0?t=1400 is?
Incredible explanation, storytelling, editing and sound design!
Your too late
Yet we can’t go back to the moon?  Seems a bit fishy.  Lol
Thank you for your time my fellow youtuber
Just another proof that usa is unreliable supplier of anything but propaganda and wars.
If people really knew how infiltrated and attacked by the Chinese we really are, thered be demands to bomb Beijing by morning.   2024 isnt far.
awesome vid
Full spectrum warfare. The ChiComs are not our friends .
Great episode 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Taiwan is the answer to many problems fir china but as time ticks china loses the ability to make the move on taking control of it . China would be wise to take Taiwan before 2026 .after 2026 the birth crisis in China will make this move impossible. War is absolutely coming folks.
Another good video Johnny, glad you put information like this out there, I mean it’s there but not a lot of people have time to constantly look for news and info. You help with summing up but still give enough depth. Thank you.
Any good stock recomwndations for this industry ?
Hi Nick, I see you!
It's amazing how the only thing that really changes is TIME ...  HISTORY does nothing but REPEAT itself over and over again...  The bottom line is HUMANSwill always be GREEDY as FUCK, even when it's obviously leading to Our own destruction...  Some years ago I wondered how could Hitler do all that he did in a little country that's not very much bigger than the state of Texas In a country that was virtually bankrupt at the end of World War I in 1918...  Yet, by 1939 when the Nazis invaded Poland, Germany had already become so powerful, it was able to start another World War in such a devastating fashion...  How in the HADES did all of that MASSIVE POWER develop within such an itty bitty litty Country, over just 20 short years?   Well, upon diligent RESEARCH, I found out it was WALL STREET who financed much of the build up of the Nazi Regime...  At first, they and US politicians justified all of that investment to the American people by saying they were only investing in German roads, commercial aviation, their automotive industry, and the Country's infrastructure.  All while knowing fully well, the Nazis were using those roads to move their TANKS and fighter PLANES, they were also using that same money to build up....  And the only reason US politicians forced them to STOP was after Germany's sworn ally Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, causing Hitler to also declare War on the US...  How much of a BACK STABBING WAS THAT?   BUT ...  Isn't that EXACTLY what American businesses were doing by them INVESTING hundreds of TRILLIONS of American dollars in COMMUNIST CHINA, over the last 40 years?   When now we know, they were only using Our technology and INVESTMENTS to prepare themselves for a WAR AGAINST US....   Hell, just in 1961 China was one of the POOREST Countries Worldwide, who had millions of their own people STARVE TO DEATH that year!!!  Guys, all of that BUILD UP OF POWER in China has happened within Our lifetime, right before most of our very own eyes, all while US politicians were giving US Corporations TAX BREAKS for them moving OUR JOBS OVER TO CHINA...   NOW, the way it stands, guess whose sons, daughters and grand children are going to be DYING, in order to bring those very same COMMUNISTS right back down to where they were, before all of this got started by NIXON?  The very same POOR PEOPLE'S sons, daughters, and grand children who got absolutely NOTHING OUT OF IT!!!!
The Netherlands side of the conflict with ASML is exceptionally interesting as well. Plenty of Dutch regulations on the Chinese
bro called taiwan a country XDDDDD
Funny thing is, both country's suck at building anything.. Thumbs down
I can't wait till we realize, we're all on one single ship, and if we sink it, we all lose.
Maps !!
Chip chip BRUHHH 😅😅
We're gonna build the most advance stuff right here in Ohio. Aliens in Ohio: You bet!
You got a lot of silicon my dude
China's access to advanced microchips wouldn't be a problem if the CCP weren't so bent on being a military bully, the problem here is not the US blocking chip access it's the CCP being a belligerent state.
For people who believe in this Utopian perfect world I have news for you, will never happen because of human nature and others forces that most people know nothing about. Human greed and the search for control others, what they sell you is one thing what they do is a whole different thing, globalists at Davos are planning all the steps in order that control is complete, they dont care about us, they are putting a show for us about all these wonderful good 17 goal intentions and how the world will become in a better place, but not, they continue making weapons without stop, and they continue making wars because wars are a business, in this moment we have many wars going on not just Ukraine. The problem is that history has been forgotten, nobody think that is important to study history but the ones we do know that this is not nothing new, different technology but the same, this time it will not be different, globalism is communism but with soft power and a huge scale, practically the whole world, and we the people, are losing, because we consent, we think that the oligarchs and the mega companies and the big money have our best interest at heart, and that is not true, never was, never will be because power is a drug.
Oww really? This and any other war only become more obvious…always. Literally and metaphorically speaking. 😉
When will Johnny talk about the UFO - UAP ? 😸
👍🇺🇸wins…
Really great work Johnny
So US greed basically gave their biggest rival a 60 year leap forward... seems kinda bad.
Amazing video, I really enjoyed this! The Semiconductor war, very interesting, yet very concerning to think about...
Holy SHIT this is getting juicy; more so than I could've imagined. A few wrong turns and this could get *ugly.*
great vid
I work in the semi conductor industry as a design engineer in the US and I feel great after watching this video, especially the short story of the mind boggling chip manufacturing process. Its unknown to many but its just out of the world tech innovation humans have ever come across. Many also don't know the impact of this trade war in their day to day life. I am happy you summarized it pretty well. I would love to watch a video on the whole cycle of chip designing. Its really interesting and it would be great for others to hear it from you. Great job Johnny.
Bet you can’t guess how many times chips is said in this video.
Excellent video production.
Why Us have afraid off china army ? China invade other countrys per year like the Us army ?
i love you
Yup we are in the futre but we cant see it we need too wakeup.
Dope video
So basically these chips are small enough to unsuspectingly insert into us humans 😳 💉🩸
that's why all americans (as in all and every americans including businessmen!) shouldn't be complacent! shouldn't be near sighted by just thinking about tax cuts and other benefits that china is offering them in short term! Because china is stealing all american ideas and in long term, all as in all american businessmen will be out of business! the last laugh would be for china! Likewise, american political leaders must do everything they can by passing a law or laws that protect and support american businesses by giving them special incentives! if china can, why can't american government support their own brilliant businessmen?
This whole video is blatant US propaganda. Only question is, are you paid, or just brainwashed and doing this for free?
Not a big fan of Reagan, but idk if it's fair to say that him banning japanese imports (which were only unfairly made cheap through market manipulation via subsidy) is against his free market values. He could have ignored it and abandoned his values all the same. There's no winning for his values in that situation. 😂
Learning here is like winning.
With the way truth or logic gates work I can't see how we can stop elections from completely jumping the gate at 2nan that's insane
I can't stand using this expression "Level Up".
My God!! What a  VIDEO!! what a DOCUMENTARY!!! You're the best journalist I know brhuv. Keep the good work!
Why did the USA allow Taiwan to manufacture micro chips they were made in the USA now we will go to-war for that decision how much will that cost the USA how many trillions how many life’s why do we not buy oil from Canada instead of the Middle East how many life’s now many trillions of dollars I do not understand the USA has many places to get oil and then there nukes power put it on ships that can be plug into the grid if a problem happens the ship can be taken out to sea now we all have nukes that China can kill us any time they want . Thanks USA government you sold us out .
Transistors are now a few atoms wide. They are so small that quantum tunneling is becoming a significant problem. It's not theoretical anymore. There are real electrical issues caused by quantum tunneling interrupting exchange between transistors.
suggestion for a video: Narendra modi vs BBC's documentary on him
确实，视频质量一如既往的好
Great Stuff Johnny way to go!
These micro chips will soon start being produced in the state of Sonora Mexico. A huge amount of money will be invested by US Canada and Mexico in order to produce these chips closer to the US.
hey Nick @1:50
Bro , I already thought i knew all about this war, but the history, the presentation, the details blew me away. You earned urself a fan😊
One thing that every adult learns from real life is how hard/complex things become when you get into the details, even seemingly straightforward things.  The global economy is too interconnected now that no one can truly be independent. Chairs? Sure. Microchips? No way. Yes the US is the most important player in making them, and China is only a consumer. But if you look at the entire list of things needed for US to get their chips. I don't need to be a chip expert to know some of them must require Chinese stuff. And at least one of them are bound to be irreplaceable. If it really comes down to that, it's easily either everyone has chips, or no one has chips.
Hey Dude, Taiwan is way much more than a neighbour of China. Please don’t misinform the folks please
That explains why graphics card are so high
Professional hypeman
Magic rocks rule the world and only the wizards in the towers know the secret language to conjure and control their powers.
I want learn how you do research your very good at explaining which I have a problem improving any tips
The movement when the cons of globalization come to light.
A bit of nuanced is missed here. All chips aren't banned, just the latest generation of chips. That's an important caveat.
great explanation johnny
the smarter thing to do is double down on Korea, Japan and Taiwan tech and keep Okinawa hot and ready….Japan and Korea need to learn to defend themselves because they left Vietnam by themselves, the Korean conflict is way older than that
I used to work in Fab11x for years and let me tell you the tools and automation they use is really cool. I have seen it all
Basically you've said nothing and bang, advertising. You people don't know marketing.
I am a minimalist to the degree that probably 60% of my belongings come from goodwill, 30% are gifted/hand me downs/found, and I buy the last 10%. I drive a hoopty from 87 because it's less harmful to the environment than a  newly manufactured Tesla - and I'm too broke to buy something more solid than the hoopty.   Looking at most of the products that people are worried about sort of makes me scoff because new tech doesn't usually enrich enjoyment or the artistic process. Good work is good work. It's typically just a facade for consumerism driven by lack of creativity/dedication.   When I go through the aisles of goodwill I see a glut of abandoned, perfectly usable products.
Not even a minute in and there's a correction that needs to be made, Everyone needs to not hang on every word of Johnny's, he's telling a story and taking a lot of liberties with that. If something's taking your attention, it's worth confirming the information herewithin.
I'm disappointed in the lack of chopsticks in this video as you're talking about chips.
China is limited to 7nm chips while Taiwan, korea and japan have license to 5nm machines from ASML (netherlands)
The universe was born in conflict. Everything that It holds, is held in tension. This tension is recursive from the micro, to the macroscopic. Everything you see, and every interaction you have, is an argument.
USA Terrorist country! NATO Terrorist entity! FMI Thieves!
Love the video bro thank you for your contribution to a better world
What's preventing those hurting chipmakers from working for the US military and becoming their own FABS?
Powerful storytelling skills
Isn't India about to step up their semiconductor industry
All of the sudden Trump was right. 🤦🏻‍♂️
BULLSHIT, a military chip doesn't need to be in the most advanced manometer SCALE!!!! US breaks the free market rule.
What you missed here was actually that Trump started this tradestop and forced the hands of the German and Holland companies/producers of the machine parts.. ASML (for the automateed enclosed machines containing the EUV technology etching the Chips with 13.5nm, used in latest iPhones/Macs and the new high-NA EUV with 2nm coming out in 2024) and Carl Zeiss (for the Elite class optics) could not do parts for China  and strongarmed Taiwan so they did npt sell latest technology to China so they could not build things or a machine nor access with the latest EUV laser technology and even later editions.  BUT you know what happends? Carl Zeiss is building a new factory in China, was announced at end of Octoberz. That means China are already in the full works of getting the optics for their new FABS INSIDE of China. Instead of needing to rely on EU companies and unnecessary transports. They will build their own ASML types of machines.   ASML were hacked in 2021.. so probably Chinese have access to the blueprints of even the latest 2024 machines for 2nm transistors.  They were saying China could not build ASML type of machines for 10y but they probably shorted these times down now. Would not be surprised if China already has high-NA EUV 2nm chips access already in 2024/’25 also..
Johnny talk about hot takes on geopolitical topics if you make a podcast
If I was president and I knew my leading edge semi conductor company was selling their product to China, aiding their military advancement. I would hit them with fines like the EPA did to dodge for selling hellcats.
silicon ain't metal, pins are, some casing, but the chip itself ain't
I truly appreciate your channel. Content is amazing and so well organized. Thank you for the knowledge and please continue the great work
Quality production.
That's realistic international geopolitical affairs, good content
The chips act has nothing to do with helping you. And everything to do with bailing out the country of California. Because the Democrats there have been so successful at running the entire economy straight into the ground. They needed a bail out.  Case you haven't noticed, the last three years, your federal government has been bailing out all kinds of industries without, Congressional hearings. They're just writing checks to all of their donors. And passing ATS, that secure the future of all of their donors, for the next hundred years.
Pity, you couldn't give some credit to Trump, who actually was the first president, to recognize the threat...
Glass is silicon, too, Johnny. :( Granted, it's not the semiconductor / integrated circuit kind...
nice game
The overwhelming majority of the CHIPS Act and groundwork for reshoring/building FABS in America was done under the….Trump administration.
Cool information
Nvidia losing 400m is like losing a penny to them, besides they've been ripping the gaming world with their overpriced GPUs!
One thing Johnny missed in the video is china has been hiring Taiwan engineers with ridiculous wage and buying equipment to made their own chips no matter the cost. And the truth is they succeed in fabricating low end chips, grabbed big market share by cheapest price and full stocks during the chips shortage. They are now advancing to mid tier chips like WiFi and 4G for IoT device. USA moves in banning chips is just a "better than none" tactics. The war will go on.
The simplicity with which he has explained. Hats Off!
China is really good at paying people for secrets. . . ie . . . . everything we banned.
Taiwan has always been part of China prove me wrong
I'm american and AMERICA makes me sick. Once the leader in everything, now a pathetic loser. They deserve whatever they got coming.
This is too good
Don't feel too bad for Nvidia.
from carving rock caves to carving switches on silicon.. look how far we have come..
Ugh, it pains me to see that Bharat missed the Silicon Rush 😥
Woaaaaaa
In fact, Chinese people make chips technical better than American, TSMC the one of co-finder Morris is Chinese people, because he born in China. Intel and AMD manufacturer’s technology is fallen now, e.g AMD is using TSMC chips technology, otherwise, no one wanna use.
Though India is far behind yet i understand why Indian government has started investing in chip making. They are about to open FABS. Becouse being relient on China or USA is deadly for aspiring nations like India.
I've enjoyed this upload... intellectually stimulating, this semi documentary  permanently compelled me to Uninstaller tiktok.
yeah my hometown in ohio has annexed a shit ton of land to build an intel chip factory
I learned alot in this video n connected some dots that I was never able to connect B4 like why is such a small country interested by the two most powerful countries in the world? Now I know why. Thanks
Down like ohio, swag like ohio, tsmc in ohio, intel in ohio
This analysis is missing a huge point, which is that China almost certainly knew this moment would come and has been preparing for this moment for some time. Anyone that is aware of the rhetoric in American intelligence/policy circles knows that there has been an ongoing obsession with China. If your ordinary Joe knows it, the Chinese establishment probably knew it 10 years before. And to think that they didn't prepare for an obvious eventuality is to assume they're as inefficient as the US -which, let's face it, hasn't had a leadership with any real plan in decades.  The Chinese have already bought the Dutch company that is key in making semiconductors (the EU is trying to void it to keep the US onside), and -if they were able to totally catch the US offguard with a new weapon- you can assume they are way ahead of what the US assumes in terms of chips production.  This is more about a nation in steep decline desperately trying to stop the inevitable. Yes, they might be able to slow down the new kid on the block, but they can't stop him. Not sure what it will mean for the rest of the world, but it's probably safe to say that less Middle Eastern children will get bombed.
Hey johnny harris, for your next video can you explain how some company makes their money, for instance facebook yet no one spends a penny on it, or snapchat, or instagram. I understand ads but that seriously cant be the powerhouse? Ive wanted to know this for a long time. How do some companys make money when somethings is free to use?
I don't need silicon and cobalt and think the world would be better off without it. This guy makes entertaining content with it though. Funny & informative. So, maybe not. 🤔
There is no brakes. Borg.
Dude, soooo good. Thanks for doing the research and then laying out in such an easy-to-learn way.
Amazing 👏 thank you
But now it's too late. The majority of American and European company has finally brought their products or sold to China in the last 30 years and still is, due to low production costs and wages. ( Tesla Giga Shanghai, Apple, Acer, Siemens, Milwaukee, AEG, Makita, Vestas Vindmøller, etc. ). It was a Chinese trap to bring companies and their technology to China and then copy everything. On the other hand, in the west, many jobs were left empty and a large steepness of the unemployed. But now it's too late, China is developing like never before. Everything you buy is made in PR China ....
This should be a movie, love the research and animation and politics. Keep up the good work bro
Is this guy aware that US government does not accept Taiwan as a country and there are only a handful countries which have the formal diplomatic relationships with Taiwan?
Good news almost everyone of those silicone devices is a want and not a need.   To think someday all the stuff will be in landfill. This includes me too. Man we buy way too much junk to put into our homes.
Great video! Thanks for the education
I m electronics Engineer and working as quality control engineer looking for opportunities in semiconductor or microchip or IC and PCB manufacturing industry
I mean, I don't care if the US is falling behind in terms of military technology. All this time US has the technological advantages and what they did? They commit warcrime in the middle east.
From strippers, to bombs. Silicone is in EVERYTHING!
... except they left loopholes for the companies to keep selling to china.
Subd jst now
They don't need chip's! That's just semantics! They have already used less obvious means like smart dust, the bio & tech that is the jab which sheds on those that did not choose the jab. So wake up people! Most are already controlled bio robots. It's not easy fight for your own consciousness especially if you are being targeted specifically.
17:14 the day when you uploaded this video, India officially became the most populous country.
For a second I thought it said mitochondria war.
Took three minutes to say the military uses, of all thngs, micro-chips. Why, who would ever have imagined? 'Fraid this is just a bit too insulting, buddy. I mean, THREE MINUTES, instead if three seconds?
China lies ...
No one can beat china, china is now 100 years ahead of the entire world
so TSMC is the Anaheim electronics of the gundam universe. AWESOME!
I can't buy an iPhone and Samsung phones are crappie!!!
You neglected to discuss a major part of this. Taiwan is actually a part of China, not a separate country. They are currently seen as a self-governed entity, but China sees Taiwan as part of their country. Imagine if the US had a civil war and one side was beat down and had to retreat until that whole side ended up in Hawaii. Then that side decided to take Hawaii and call it their own country. Well, that's what happened with Taiwan. China doesn't intend to give up a piece of what they consider their country. Also, this has been going on a lot longer than Biden administration. Trump actually started the ball rolling by getting the US back into the chip making game. It takes years and years to build a FAB and we are now getting close to having a couple of our own. Nice job on the video.
To extend on the "everything is silicon," it includes almost every device powered by electricity, except if it specifically uses mechanical parts for their operation (such as light switches).  Every device imaginable that you can interact with, you can be sure that it has a semiconductor inside. Of course it can also be a very small part of that device, but many devices it as their major components nowadays.
The arrogant trade gangster are jerks! 🖕 Down with the tech sanction bullies! 👎 All hail Quantum chip pioneers! ✊ Long live STEM engineers! 💪 May they and their descendants live in Peace & Prosperity for Ten Thousand years! 💖🙏🚀
But Taiwan is part of China through the OCP, signed and acknowledged by the US as well... Did you miss that?  Again, Russia did not cut its supply of gas to Europe. In fact, the EU sanctioned Russia which prevented EU countries from buying Russian gas... Did you miss that too?
A lot of bla bla bla from politic people, they are ONLY FUCKING PLAYING WITH US, WAR EVERY WHERE SO THEY HAVE MORE MONEY, FUCKING MONEY AND POWER
Silicon is the new oil.
Ok what is really exactly about Micro Chip CPU technology which USA is struggling to master  ?????????
I work in semiconductors. It’s something I never saw myself doing (getting into manufacturing) because I really believe in environmental sustainability, but this industry is easy to justify as we need them like we need food/water at this point to sustain ourselves. My company specifically has offices in the US and China, so I’m interested to see how this plays out. This isn’t something where you can just “build factories”, it’s a really complex process that relies on hundreds of seasoned semiconductor professionals, which aren’t exactly easy to come by (everyone is short staffed). Personally, I don’t see how we win this, knowing the cost differential and the knowledge that needs to be passed down generation to generation which quite frankly, hasn’t been. Also, knowing the cost/rarity of equipment, you can’t exactly “just scale up” the production, there are monopolies on the companies which make the semiconductor manufacturing equipment, like, there’s 1 company in the world and it doesn’t exist anymore so we’re all buying scrap parts and using machine shops unless you’re Intel…The US has certain expertises just like China has theirs, so I suppose it’s a matter of who gets a hold of who’s IP first as well, the smaller sites hold a lot of really useful IP that are inefficient that the bigger companies would never build if they wanted to sustain their margins. A small wafer fab probably costs a billion to open, so I am also curious how they spend that $300B and doubt it’s enough to get ahead
Lol, China is 10 years behind in semiconductors, and I'm being extremely generous
If you want to invest this is the market sector.  Intel, once the global leader, is investing billions into regaining that title.  Taiwan Semiconductor is another strong company.   Right now if it’s not Chinese and it’s semiconductors it’s a good place to put your money.  China is in the midst of an economic, and demographic collapse.  They don’t make high end chips, they are not a high end producer of anything.
Thank you Jonny and the Team for this very interesting topic. As we are looking at this, is it possible to do a piece on the "de-dollarisation" and the appearance of a "multi-polar" world and how China is courting Saudi Arabia to join the BRICS? This should be super interesting for those who need to see the "chips" (sorry 😀) fall into place.
good coverage of the story, it needed more maps though
50billion for chips and none for inflation... wut?
At least the US still have some strength. The UK is now almost completely in Chinas pocket (and the US for protection). To feed the investment portfolios of the rich, we have farmed out absolutely everything to the cheapest/most corrup bidder, our health system, our manufacturing facilities, our energy generation, our food. Give it another 30 years and the UK will be in a massive depression and the bottom 80% will be living like they did in 80's Soviet Union.
US being complacent , who knew????
It is free market. But only if it serves us. 🤣🤣🤣
EMP!
Thanks for covering this, I can know see a bigger picture than our government just simply telling that "wE aRe aT tHe NeW hEiGhT oF US-Taiwan reLaTioNsHiP" thing.
The Chip war wouldn't have happened if China was just honest on where they're using the US made chips.
me acting surprised when america doing american things
China will overcome their enemies HAI HEI!!!!!
There's no way Nvidia lost this much thanks to the new restrictions. They profited like crazy during the mining craze and ramped up production. Their pricing is now crazy and nobody is willing to buy their stock that they have plenty of. They are a greedy ass company and now suffering the consequences.
So ... China is "yikes" (because of interference between business and military), but not "Free-Market Reagan", I mean "US National Security" ? Is the US the only country who has the right to defend itself ?
Dude this is almost Better than any other docu I have seen ... Does this guy have any other places where he posts his stuff ??
Bro This Shit Is Real. There is A Chip war happening and Every country Want A Share of That. Like UsA🇺🇸-200Billion EU🇪🇺-100Billion South Korea🇰🇷-150Billion Japan🇯🇵-100Billion UK🇬🇧-100Billion Even My Country India🇮🇳-initially 10Billion but Plan (100to200)Billion
Taiwan is part of China,please respect it before make your  video  and stop preaching threats of China.USA is the real cancer of the world and humanity.
America is making problems everywhere.....only for their upper hand and monopoly.....
U.S. companies love for money will be the end of their countries dominance. Greed is killing their country they don't see it.
His Editing skills💥💥
I work for a company in the silicone Valley own by a Chinese owner and I know we have another company in China. I tell people at my work we are probably  making circuit boards for China. They seem to not take it serious. I believe we might because we are the only circuit board company who makes 80 to 100 layer boards. If anyone know circuit board that's a think board.  It makes sense it it for there weapons. I am not bull shiting either..
China did not have a great incentive to make their own microchips until now. The US will make China the biggest chip producer in the world by 2035, since they are now forcing them to do it. That's not how free market and capitalism works. That's how totalitarian regimes work.
He forgot to mention about new upcoming manufacturer INDIA.. Sooner or later 30% to 40% market will capture by India if every thing goes according to the plan
How does it make sense that China buys/steals chips and tech from the US but they somehow have Military weapons that we don't have. Does anyone actually believe that? How many Chinese jets,boats or cars have you heard good things about?
I cant help but think that this is no longer journalism, but dramatized fear mongering.
Great video. Thank you
♥️💐☕️👈👏
Yes we can see it very clearly, a lot of documentaries are already made on it.
Just for info india is most populous now😂
I love Taiwan, visited many times and it’s the food and people are amazing.❤Taiwan 🇹🇼
Holy sh.T my mind is blown
China is doing more than just simply being a customer to US tech industries. They also sabotage and use Hackers to obtain classified US tech secrets...
Not Microchips but Artifical Intelligence. Get your brain chip soon coming this summber from Black Stone's NeuralTech or Elon Musk's Neural Link.
Micro chips? Makes me wonder maybe its created using lazers and certain crystals to split the light beam up to small enough fractiled light, still powerful enough to cut the micro chip. Also sound vibration freqiency to get the precision.
Really interesting topic that I'm not gonna watch because you lost my trust. Why the hell did you become evil, you had such a great content
Meanwhile in India government trying to make  religion conflict using there godi media to divert attention from important things
Meanwhile, citizens just want to get along with each other. I love Chinese culture and want to learn more about the country and its people. This is unfair and ABSOLUTELY NOT what many of us want. We want PEACE!
We need to bring South America into the picture before they fall to the Russians. Same with Africa and China. The U.S. could dominate is they established a larger economic presence on these continents and rebuilt their economies/infrastructure. Plenty of incentives for the greedy corporations to play along and ditch China. Expand militarily into Eastern Africa to deter China and Russia (Syria) at the same time.   America’s bigotry always clouds it’s decision making. Luckily the opposition isn’t in the position to fully capitalize.
thanks for clear explanation
This shortage is because of AI. The public just found out about how advanced AI is, but in the background the higher ups have realized the obvious foreseeable future and the computation required for this. My theory
I REALLY enjoyed the shots at the end of the video where it displayed a bit of the production materials.  I LOVE IT
Dude, you're house is a mess 😅
my man didn’t have to unplug his whole house to get to his point 😂😂 Good vid
Thanks!
Yeah - I read “Chip Wars “ too
Anywhere in the globe USA is always involve in war & chaos. A warmonger, terrorist criminal government.
“The Netherlands makes this crazy UV laser machine.” Lol i thought ASML would’ve deserved a little more explanation here. If they go away, our future chip production goes bye bye.
Pople learning about this for the first time in 2023 lmaoo you guys are living under a rock with your phones stuck to your faces
There’s major misleading things that advanced chips nothing about  military. Military need robustness strength rather than size. The only reason the same as Japan 30 years ago. American hate people touch their “drug” level revenue business like weapons and chips.
"The X-1000...is a masterpiece. Imagine a microchip sophisticated enough to control the guidance systems of ballistic missiles. Imagine it can be used to instantly upgrade any system that it's plugged into, like a smart drug for machines. Then, imagine it can learn." -Ralph Quist
I think you underestimated China.  By the way when you saw them fly that rocket around the world it was not a test it was a warning and a flex.  Like they have a million more where that came from and so does Russia too
Not sure how you went to agree for scalar🫣
13:12 You misinterpreted on Morris Chang. He grew up in China and went from Hong Kong to the US, not from Taiwan. Later he came to Taiwan to start his business. There’s no clear cut. History is complex
Greed will undo us and it's already started.
Love this videos thank you 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I knew Jhonny back in our Utah days. What a grifter.
@6:27 the on/off switch lol like red stone in mine craft. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-NGRXY5u0
One thing you did not said... The machines who made the chips are made in Europe by a single company... Those are imported from Europe to Taiwan... Hahaha 🤣😂 What  stop China not to make them own chips? Nothing...they will do exactly that.. Buy them own machines and use them to make them own chips..
i studied microelectronics the first thing our teacher said in class was "the microchips are like shovels in good rush "
Chips?! Boastful Pride itself is a sin for a Christian, blinded one's understanding & causes a war. The U.S. owed China about trillions while China viewed themselves as Western 'victim; Both & any country will fall once its sin is completed in the LORD's sight
We may become master smugglers of chips one day.
Also Intel is building a fab behind my house as we speak
the optics aren't the best.
U clearly have zero comprehension of the nanometer scale and what it actually measures and refers to. Not to mention that nm process nodes haven't actually corresponded to gate length since like 14nm processes.
You can't hate the inventor. China is  stealing inventions
USA is a great country. But I wish they played fair. They crush everyone periodically except Europe.
Very great wonderful job 🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯✅✅✅
I live in the same city where the 100B $ Micron factory is being built
Intro was a little lengthy but the video was great all in all. Thanks
Amazing video
You grabbing all that stuff gave me anxiety
*and of course the US is doomed to lose...😅*
except that China will find a way to get silicone or to recreate silicone
I love when biden said alright in the background.🤣

Julian Assange’s conviction trial has begun, he will be put in prison for 100+ years by the US. Where is the freedom of speech which US preaches? Is it not valid for US but for the rest of the world?
Your presentation is fabulous❤
USA runs a drone programme, since W Bush and Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen Somalia, Libya, on and on....not China That's extra judicial assassination of anybody anywhere by drone....
Yes bro please share this is what has us at a state of emergency    We need to stop Chinese imperializeation    They are not trying to have globalization they want a Chinese planet & the Russians want a Russian one we want human global with all as one.
China is ahead on A. Haven't you seen Yi-Long Ma?
China steals from america, america steals from everyone. No new chip war, it has been going on since the start.
did you make the same propaganda video for iraq's WMD ?
If america took 150 million away from military an then build up the microchip building process it could literally be a joint Canada american project where we cut everyone out the picture
nice video bro
that ended unexpectedly
We used to fight wars for oil, now we fight wars for chips……and oil. When will humanity realize once and for all we all depend on each other. We need an enemy on another planet to unite us all.
That's right fuck those chiinxxs.
Lays and Doritos have a lot of catching up on advanced chips, they still need to remove all the air.
I am sure Trump was on this topic back in 2017. The beauty of the internet is that the internet does not forget.
Thanks!
Thank you friend
Cool to know the story of chips and how it came to be. Your documemtaries are so well done. Also nice to know the current admin possibly did one thing that helped us...jury is out on that one.  Im still convinced they are running our country into the ground with their self serving motives.
Being able to control the flow of electricity changes the world in tandem with human language. It's peculiar that logical concepts like 'if', 'and', 'or', 'else' can be constructed from groups of transistors in order to control the flow of what's being read and stored. The quantifiable/physical aspects of human perception are capable of being translated into software that gets compiled to binary that can be ran on a cpu. You're kinda controlling electricity with your mind.
Mexico will not replace Taiwan! Mexico has given enough!
Being the chip war has... America must win!!! USA! USA! USA!
Show these in a series of shorts. For people attn span.
I have reached 27:20.. and lol!!! the funniest part.. "Taiwan is a small country" 😂 .. Taiwan is a RPC.. it's China... and US can't get control over it... forget it.. back off from China!
omg do not build the new factory in Ohio 💀
Yummy chips 😋😂
If the Japanese government was subsidizing Japanese chips then it wasn't actually "Free market and Free trade", and Ronald Reagan was correct to respond to that with import taxes.
I only knew about Taiwan because of Nvidia. Didn't know that about Japan and America. Interesting..
tsmc is gonna get shafted lol
Ooooh.  A Journalist who questions his own assumptions!  Nice.  I'll be keeping an eye out for your Johnny.  Thank you for the video.  Well done.  I definitely know I am better informed for having watched it.  Would love to see you do a video on the monopoly corporations have on housing.  Even if you are a home owner, your neighbor could be a corporation.
His definition of semi-conductor really messes with me
Even though Iran was heavily sanctioned, the drones they sold Russia was made with American chips. It seems that these chip companies, don't really play straight in the sanction game.
Why do i keep getting unsubscribed from this golden channel??!!!
So basically the US is out competed and so they try dirty moves by sanctioning, banning, etc...
Yes to Podcasts!
Morris Chang is from mainland China.
I don't even want to teach English to the Chinese, how in the world is it we have so many traitors in this country?
This video made me realise that I need cash for the future big cash I mean the banks can just go off at any moment, cool.
The amount of advertising in this is unbearable
Weirdly my GF has silicon aswell, however still not able to use her smart capabilities , perhaps i should check her firmware 💁
18:12 lol stop splitting Taiwan! Taiwan is in China dude!! It's an RPC ! And US want to attack China to take control of that RPC.. chip chip chip yep
Are we surprised Reagan was President in 1987?
Silicone is old shit, the Chinese graphene chip is the future...
HI NICK
Rumors of war over micro chips wont happen.  Mexico will take over the microchip sector for North America .
Missing out a very crucial point, that i wish it was talked about but was left out. Before US chip blockade, the very top talent in microchip design, engineers, employees of all levels are Chinese. Not only are they working in American companies, but in taiwanese companies as well.
Just bc he's a WEF anti freedom shill doesn't mean he's lying about this, good information from a new world order shill.
I wonder if Johnny has ever had to fight for anything or seriously defend himself or someone he cares for. I wonder if he ever would really fight for himself instead of just looking shocked at the prospect of conflict.
china will win in long run and by the way Taiwan is  not a country , its part of china / even usa agrees to one china policy
So China can not advance its military to protect itself from being surrounded by US military bases in Asia? So China can not advance its military to prevent being attacked and colonized like what happened during the century of humiliation? So China can not advance its military while the US continually advances their weapons industry and has all the nuclear cards to point at anyone anytime they feel threatened? The US just wants to monopolize every freaking thing so they can get richer and richer and continue to get cheap labour from the rest of the world while they preach free market, equality and freedom. Freaking supremacist, always has been. The only country the world needs to be afraid of is the US itself, there’s no other country in modern history that is as deadly and as greedy as the US. You will invade countries out of “freedom” to get their resources then blame them for the wreckage you created and let the neighboring countries deal with the mess. It’s disgusting and Americans are too narcissistic to have this self awareness.
Well done young man. Excellent.✌️
This video was an eye opener in that we should keep our friends close but our enemies even closer! Also, if we still allow the Chinese to be educated in the United States and then they go back home to China to apply what was learned, how is this not contributing to the problem and continuing the trend of advancing beyond the US?
America first. Make America Great Again 🇺🇸 ✝️
Outstanding video! …. I’m 54 years old and I kind of sort of new The importance of semi conductors but you brought up a lot of new information that I was unaware of and made it fun to watch….. Once again great job
so rich companies get free money and build FABS here because we were too greedy in the past to keep it here because of lets all say it, MONEY.  yeah money doesnt rule to the world.   nope.
so we sell tech to China and we are surprised they use it?   come on now.
Have a haircut
It’s a shame that in the end. Both the US and China actually just want to use chip technology for weapons and not other technological advancements that would actually help humanity.
Globalism is failing... Nationalism is rising... Globalism means a central power controls all nations. This is a terrible idea. Decentralization via Nationalism is better.
correction needed: Trader Joe's neither makes or sells Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. ;)
I had already done all this research myself and your team have summarized it very well! Excellent work ✊🏻
the fact that i have the same midi keyboard as tom makes me feel a lot better about it
Everything was great until ohio (can’t trust)
Does ASML ring a bell Johnny Boy??????
"metal-like substance" - just call it _semimetal_ geez. Is the periodic tables that unknown in USA?
Influencers trying to talk tech and geopolitics is sad
your fear is unfounded, Harris.  did you know that most of TSMC's technology is actually owned by USA and its cronies? and recently, a new branch of TSMC is currently in construction in USA, so why the fear? what they need in taiwan is just their workers...even taiwan's most talented fab PhD cannot work outside TSMC without TSMC's technology which is very expensive and owned by USA... it's not like china is able to mimic USA's tech in just a blink of eye..sure china has a lot of smart people, but no matter how smart they are, all they can do is just making poor copycats at maximum because their basic mentalities are actually in business sector, not in technological innovation... you surely know that china does not even able to design a car engine by themselves right?
I think Trevor Wallace did a piece on this guy
Hi, Nick.
As a electronic technician, having problems looking for jobs since the repair biseness is low given how buying/building new stuff is cheaper and "better" than fixing what you have  I wonder if in the near future we will have a rebirth of electronic technicians jobs back do to this policies and resource shortage, recycling have been something we take for granted but I feel we are reaching a point where recycling will be less of a luxury and more a nessesity
Why the this things keeps popping up, im not even subscribe, what are you trying to make me watch Uncle sam?
The biggest problem is their culture... This war could be a total war
Excuse me but manufacturing thousand of stuff like iPhones in china 🇨🇳 is the recipe for att legally steal business secrets. Who was the dumbest who didn’t think this would happen???
He “Big guy “ has had relations with China for years. Had to go big on regulating China.. Sleight of hand.  Follow the money. The Focker was part of the problem that put us in this situation. Oil, chips. It’s what wars are fought over. Control over the most needed commodities = power. Which power doesn’t have a ceiling. Here’s to endless wars and people dying. Jesus we need you now.! Great vid. Btw 🤙
Your videos are so insanely in-depth but understandable. I can't understand how you keep putting this stuff online. I'd get burned out for sure.  Big respect and thank you again Johnny!
Silicon, the 'spice' of earth
Chips are tasty!
This used to be called industrial sabotage! Who says China wants chips for military? Why can't everyone have chips if they are in everything?  Wasn't China making everything for the world? Yesterday?  The world's factory? AND wasn't it AMERICA  that pulled out of nuclear talks and treaties (Trump) it's AMERICA who sh**s on everybody else!  Just ask the native American Indians about the colonisers, and treaties)
I'd argue the fallacy that economic interdependence prevents all out war.  Many politicians  and economists prior to World War I stated European economies were too interdependent to ever go to war even though tensions were high. Its very much like today where a catalyst event like a technology embargo or an assassination of a politician may trigger a knee jerk overreaction by superpowers and into all out war.
So much for “free market”
And judging by the amount of bragging from Biden and Blinken and others,  ("weaken Putin") etc it's my bet that America blew up Nord stream 1+2 (with the assistance of UK (Boris and Truss)  Plus the "great opportunity"(Blinken) this unfortunate event now afforded to USA specifically the sale of fracked gas to Europe at seven times the price of cheap Russian gas. Historically the west and big time USA is the aggressor in the world not China, and Germany, who invaded Poland, and please let's remember, it was Russia who overcame the Nazis, liberating the death camps.
China will do what it has always done. It will steal the designs through cybercrime. It's been doing that to every advanced country on the planet for decades. To claim the US does not already have a hypersonic missile is incredibly naive. I have no doubt this is how China got theirs...through cyber espionage and covertly paying big bucks to somebody working in the US industry who is willing to sell.
Seems like we're losing cause there's still no cars on the lot and to get an SUV you need to pay $700/mo+.   We suck.
You're going to get a whole hell of a lot more than just a microchip war.
You're saying NVIDIA losing money is bad, and I feel you... but have you seen the prices for GPU slowly going down?
You are so good 😊 🎉
My mechanical watch..... on my boobs with silicone...
There is no trade without war, nor war without trade.   This has always been the case, unless you intertwined an economy so much that it takes almost a decade years to unravel this will always be the case. Even the EU had member states leaving.
Oh yes, this supposedly catches intelligence agencies by surprise when various right wingers have been warning about China for years, and years, and years— only to be rebuffed as “racist”. Interesting
I really don’t want China to win this war. CCP has no respect on intellectual property. It’s been known that China kept stealing tech unlike Korea or Japan that developed their own so there’s better competition for buyer.
I am a Free Market advocate, but I am also a Nationalist. So, I believe the Government and the Free Market should work together to maintain the best health, well being, and interest of the Nation and its People. We shouldn't let Companies empower our enemies like China, or Iraq, or Iran, just because we want to allow free trade of ideas, products, and services. We all know there are rogue, evil, and tyrannical Nations out there in the World, and we can't feed them with stuff that will empower them. We need to ensure that we protect our Nation and borders above all else.
Oh Wow Yikes and we are not speaking about potato chips topic in general like on a ppls lower end stuffs 😂
lol @ this guy. This wasn't Biden. It was Trump that started this. When are people going to realize left and right are playing everyone. I can't even name all the policies Biden has carried over from the Trump administration.  Trump is the one who knew China was a threat. While US politicians played good cop bad cop everyone stood around not noticing anything that's going on. Sadly the Chip industry is a fraction of the real problem.
I think economic interdependence can be good for (mostly) free market nations.  But when it comes to Russia and China, their entire economic system is nationalized so any issues are quickly escalated through a military minded process.
Taiwan is useless without dutch asml. They are the sole producer of the most advanced chip making machines.
The best Baiden's policy so far. 👌
there you go.. knew it weak troll lol  Taiwan is China.. China can't invade itself... US is invading China by going to Taiwan!! lol .. Aggression from their biggest neighbor ? lol What a joke
I have only reached the intro.. 2:50 and you are literally resuming it... microships! So... That's why US is attacking China!! for microships!! ... Your country can't mind their own business.. they must attack countries all over the world!! .. Russia (proxy war in Ukraine)... Irak (gas) .. Panama 89 for that Canal.. and China now for microships... your country has a bloody foreign policy!! I'm hoping for a multi polar world would emerge soon!! We are tired of US imperialism!!  You are a weak Youtuber... your videos about the world conflicts are weak
i cant handle another war emotionally
Love from India. The map you used in the video doesn’t show the real boards of India. Many of territories belong to India which is shown as part a part of China in the Map
wow thanks for the great information Johnny Could you make a video about the education crisis  and tell how you would learn today with the knowledge you have from making this type of content?  I´m very curious because you in one of your videos yout mentioned that you have dyslexia.
It’s a good summarization overall - but what’s need more to discuss is the threat coming from the communist regime- it’s not just a threat for US but for the glob - all measures needs be to considered before it’s getting too late.
I think South Korea makes the most advanced chips
The economy war baby
You glossed over the Netherlands, but I would argue that ASML is more important than Taiwan in the big picture. US makes the design and software, ASML makes the machines, and Taiwan does the manufacturing. Without ASML, there is no chip. I also wouldn't underestimate the greed of US companies, corruption of government officials, cyber attacks, and intelligence of china. US companies don't care about morals or ethics. They sell weapons to the one who has them surrounded and taking shots at them. They sell to dictators today and genocide leaders today. Why would this be different? The US is so dependent on china today, I would argue the US is the weaker of the parties in this conflict. During covid, we were brought down to our knees with masks and toilet paper. We didn't have enough ventilators to care for the sick. china has us by the throat, and this must change.
The smartest students in the USA are studying law and economics (not engineering) and ratio between Engineering vs all students is much lower than in China and China has more students than USA (much larger population, of course). So they are "producing" many more engineers every year than USA - How long before they develop their own technology more advanced?
hey harris i’m From India and i’m waiting for bring something interesting on British colonialisms in India 🇮🇳 … plz
I better not see a SINGLE $1500 GPU come out of a TAX PAYER FUNDED chip fab in 2025
Comparing Processing to Magic is both hilarious and accurate 🤣🤣
Man that ti 108
I feel like that's what Russia is doing right now.. knew that with this Ukraine conflict USA would send weapons and Russia could reverse engineer them and sell to china or something also and gain the ports of Ukraine..
Interesting to see US was hitting on Japan microchip industries so hard back then that it got them crippled. Today we see Japan ganging up with US to cripple other country microchip industries.  Wow.
Why did the USA do this? like make cooler tech OR HIRE CHINESE DEVELOPERS
America is going to lose yhe chip war! There is no way we can compete with the mass manufactuere of the world ! They have more people , their wages are cheaper, and their education is better!
I looked to my wife for comfort... she is silicone.
best thing they can do is a green solar and wind energy revolution, to make it private must have, same as smartphones or cars. and this is definately good for economy. or start to produce all they were producing in china in usa and supermodern and superbest, creative etc way, for people at least have job and creative thinking etc. world of consumers is degenegative to people
and what is the plan to do with chips in usa??? even if some dumbass bill gates and zuckerberg, all investors at wall street and ilon mask will work together they will never do beter than even one small sony :)) what kind of new products they think they will invent???))) sony 8k 16 etc tv and vr will allways be beter, and sony playstation will allways be beter and there is nothing else future needs. all they can do is to print money by trillions and create metaverses noone needs
Im sold watched this vid just now and now throwing myself into the spiral of ur videos loool   See u in the next one
And then Nvidia just renamed their A-100 chips and continued to sell them in droves. Fuck Nvidia.
I'm pretty sure chips can afford air freight.
Incredible video and an amazing presentation overall.
but there is no tech growing, except sony vr and 8k products, and any thinkable weapons can perfectly work with tech of a 10 years old smartphone.
Currently, there is a significant research going on to switch from Silicon to Organic Semiconductors (OSCs), check it out :)
Heed Revelation 13:9-18 and I would love to tell you The Truth from The Holy Bible about what is going on. However, I politely encourage you to read it for yourselves. By The Way, check out Truthunedited and Stephan Darby's sermons to get a deeper understanding for The Life. May YAH bless you, your families, and HALLELUYAH!
Subscribed very interesting 👍🏻
china can produce anything they want, except sony playstation and sony 8k tvs, with old chips at old equipment, in china. so i suppose all this is a bullshit :)) world economy is simply died
Very good over view
I remember how much Trump was warning everyone about China, and the media just called him xenophobic.
I must be misunderstanding something. Bidens chip policies are basically rewritten Trump policies. But when Trump's policies went into effect it crippled the auto industry and caused the shortage, but when Biden dressed them up and implemented them, they are responsible for stopping China from nuking the world. Please explain.
artificial inteligence of internet sended to me a contest commercial in this video - about lays chips :)))
The US is going down. Period.
TSMC is also building factories and sending people back to the US to manufacturing there. Taiwan is losing the shield very quickly, with KMT recent big win. Majority of the people fed up with the BS the DPP keep pissing on China while the KMT is a more obedient younger brother that maintain peace for the last 70 years.
Very well done, thank you for such a great lesson!
Thanks again, great job!
If the US destroyed the TSMC fabs and framed China for it...
Awesome content. This deserves more appreciation.
Nancy Pelosi is going to hell no matter how many billions she has
As a semiconductor patent expert... yeah, it's a big deal that Biden shifted these policies
Cut off the chip supply is such a bad, bad, bad idea for doing business with your competitor's. We should sell them unlimited chips with a backdoor inside the design. By doing this, you are not just making big bucks from them, but also know exactly every single move they make. Further more, make them 100% rely on your feeding, so they will become weaker and weaker.
This baboon concealed that China's military chips are all independently manufactured by itself, and military and civilian chips are two. Seriously, civilian chips only affect the Chinese economy
US is using dirty tactics when free commercial market is against them. US and West spread lies and misinformation just want to demonize China in order to contain China progress. US and West are despicable and lost their dignity in front of the world to see. Everyone is distancing themselves away from the US as US is behaving like a mafia who lies, spread misinformation, false accusations and threaten others. US is a warmonger who funds chaos and wars throughout history in order to contain other countries progress.
Exquisite work! Thank you, SO MUCH!  I can only imagine how interesting it'd be to observe just one day of your living experience.  💝
This is such a well put together presentation.bravo 👏🏽
The Map, damn China is engulfing India into it. Where is the world. No one said anything while China distorts world map ?
Very informative... this has made me go on a rampage to learn all history of Microchips... thank you Johnny...
I wish this had spanish subtitles option to reccomended to my friends and family in Chile and Colombia and Paraguay and Venezuela, etc. I love this chanel, very very educational. I was 49 years old when I learned how a chip works.
The policies are based on two assumptions.  One is USA FAB and chips manufacturers can find an alternative market the size of China.  If not the taxpayers will have to continue to subsidize USA chips for landfills.  Secondly it assume that China cannot innovate or make chips.  Some reminders are the space station, nuclear missiles and the GPS system etc which proved to the contrary.  It is just a matter of time.  The potential is China might be down for a while but when the time comes its chips and EUV machines might destroy the global monopolies of these technologies.
Can you do a video on China and Congo
Liberalism always gives way to Realism with enough time.
The U.S. has been willingly and happily f***ing itself for DECADES! For Chinese money, it allows Confusius Institutes on college campuses, lets their "students" come over and study sensitive information, permits spy drvices called TiKTok on everyone's devices, and gives up all its business secrets for the privilege of having access to China's market. Now the govt is ready to send us to war and die for their wreckless behavior.
Johnny has became more like average twitter user. Pathetic
I love your videos, Johnny, but you really should have had your script reviewed by someone from the tech industry, because some terms you use there are very off (few examples: "small pieces of metal" (silicon is not metal), "precise signals / switching" (one of the principle of digital technology is that the signals can afford to be junk))
hi i love you're videos, do you have the list of music used in this one :) ?
I think the real conflict is AI now.  A lot of things serve AI now and people don't even know it.  To my understanding it is the POINT behind data mining and creating financial incentive to simply just run a computer for someone else.  Computing power to try and hit the "singularity" lie lol.
How many those high end chips does the Chinese need for military use? They can simply buy that few thousands needed for weapons. So this is just for chocking off China chip industry and not really stop their military using chips.
Great video
Good one 👍
I wish the entire computer science field was explained like you explained semi-conductor. So intriguing.
Competition is always a good thing even tho one is a communist state and the other is a war machine.  Maybe the US can now stop funding rebellions in these African countries for resources and instead help build them infrastructure
That's been what Tiwan and Ukraine is all about ( Russia sitting on 40% of the world's Palladium... Ukraine the world's global super power, epicentre for the rare earth metals they need for F16 fighter jets, Apache helicopters, cables, chips, ifones, electric vehicles, batteries wind turbines.rockets, nuclear fuel rods....on and on it goes, everlasting, neverending wars is what we're looking at, displacements, detention camps,  homelessness...hunger famine.,..
Everything is orchestrated, I REFUSE TO BELIEVE that americans made a blunder by giving their tech ideas to China, it was pre-planned
Jesus I really am a sucker for these kind of videos
This is great work , thank you!
Texas Instruments is spending $30 billion on a new fab. I have worked as a manufacturing specialist there at the current one for a few years now. The precision used on these chips still blows my mind.
Humans are greedy and power hungry. It is inevitable, we will be our downfall.
I believe that there won't be any software professionals in future, there could be AI Professionals / Engineers / Managers etc. I hope Scaler will make adjustments to their curriculum.
No ingenious man invented the micro chip. It’s not comprehensible for are tiny brains. We had help and it escalated so quickly which leads me to believe that we jumped the gun on a alien technology. Oops!
If there is anything I’ve learned from Johnny Harris, it’s that America deserves it because we partook in slavery 150 years ago.   Even though China also oppressed minorities within their country (and still do very overtly), the Chinese are POC and therefore they should be the rightful hegemonic power.  America being the hegemonic power = white supremacy. If you want to be a good ally, you should allow a POC nation like China lead the world.
An Indian edTech sponsoring Jonny's video.. we are truly global!
Level up
They need to ban Tiktok already. What are we doing allowing an entire generation to install Chinese Spyware on their phones?
US companies are selling software,  microchip technologies,  manufacturing equipment, and design to China. China is now getting ahead with missiles and beyond. Taiwan is just manufacturing. Biden has now cut off China. Nvidia is now losing lots of money. Bring FABs back to the US! China may blockade Taiwan.  Globalization does not equal no war
usa fight china and india is gonna win, india, the only future superpowder, jai hind
This is what happens when greedy corporations circumvent national security.  Everyone was ok giving away intellectual property to do business in China for ages; one of the few things Trump was actually right on - stopping, or curtailing sales in order to protect America and Taiwan (the place visited by Pelosi that caused a big stink; thus American protectionism is a non-partisan issue).
I just have to say it's silly to believe china beat the United States to hypersonic weapons. I know that was what the media and everyone said at the time but. Like really? Everything china makes or does was already done by another country. China doesn't know how to actually do anything on their own.  Something crazy to think about is in 2017 china officially produced their first 100% made ballpoint pen. It took them years and years of r&d to figure it out and a crappy Bic pen is still light years better than what they can produce. The United States has known how to make pens for almost 150 years at this point.
This is what happens When american politican drive by agenda and not by Hard work
It's everything is cake but silicon
One word - Brilliant
I'm a Taiwan audince thanks for Johnny making this video let more people know about Taiwan this independent country but to all the people around the world if China invade Taiwan one day please come to help us.
I drove by that FAB that is being constructed when i was home in Arizona. Cool to see geopolitics unfolding before my eyes.
The breakdown and explanation is so well thought through. It's always a pleasure watching your content 🙌🏻
A lot of my capital is deployed with $TSM and they have been good to me...
Damn, US is so powerful its afraid of everyone. Meanwhile Russia, India and China and others act all friendly and helpful to each other.
No wonder warrant buffet is betting big on TSMC
You should also cover what China is doing. Graphene. AI. Their own lithography machine. Tinghua University.  Should be interesting.
Much appreciation for you doing all the research and putting it in much simpler and fun way.
China can make low end chips but not the end one. Believe me your daily life won’t effect very much, but China is done.
I learned so much with you thank you
semiconductors ≠ microchips. Transistors, diodes, LEDs, power regulators, rectifiers, op-amps,  etc are semiconductor parts.  Microchips are better described as integrated circuits.  More specifically VLSI ICs since we are generally talking about microprocessor parts. Also gotta say, really offputting to go from the seasick handheld frenzy of looking for all the stuff with chips in your house, to a sponsor beg.  Not followed or subscribed.
Lucky for China there are plenty Israelis willing to sell them all the usa tech they can get their grubby little hands on, thanks Kissinger and co, BB Netynyahu, East India Trading Co, etc, etc
damn this put a lot of things into perspective
This Content is Fire. Thank you for you and your teams johnny.
You’re underrating  china , they just copy and paste
Amazing work ✌️👍👍👍👍👍
I better be able to build a computer more affordably if we’re ganna be making chips here lol
nowadays there are so many resources that actually are fundalmental for world ruling that microchips is a big part of one them... but take into account grains or other source of energy which power microchips... so... just another nicely made video with a meh content...
Bro this is better then the news.. you've included share holder information, current politics and the economics and the education on where computers came from like its some kind of history lesson.. yeah bro.. wow very educational all in 30 minutes wow bro.. if this was at a university that would be like a whole semester..
Totally biased idea.
If China were to release chips that were more consumer friendly and didn't have TPM and shit. They would top the market.
Was waiting for him to say silicon is in your wife
great video
Why Ukraine is shown as a part of russia on that map? Wtf
I think we always underestimate the chinese
Make a video on Subramanyam j Shankar Indian Foreign Minister
Our brain is unlikely a digital computer more similarities with a quantum computer
Why did you say China wants to take over it's "annoying neighbour"
27:13 the music is very deep rock galactic esc, love it
Impressive! this video is based on investigative journalism. 100% sure that battle of microchips has begun. 👍🤔
You have the best content on youtube man, I'm a big fan of yours
Who supply chips to Russia?
If China doesn't buy chips who will buy all those chips
Excellent presentation!  If this or any other human advancement isn't focused on peaceful use then there's NOTHING to applaud here. The insane funds going into developing techs & weapons for the SOLE purpose of killing other human beings speak volumes of our inhumanity! This and other continuing refinement of all military-linked tech will eventually lead to ARMAGEDDON!  Fueled by an insatiable greed by the west for dominance, profit, resources and an incurable lunacy, we are being taken down a path that WILL inexorably ignite a global conflagration, literally end the lives of billions, destroy our physical world and probably end life the way we know it.  When the inferno feeding off human bodies and nature subsides and the dust finally settles, Africa, perhaps will be the only ONE standing.  The only with a CHIP on its shoulders!
This video was thoroughly studied. It's great and very informative and supported by a visual presentation that helped us to understand more about this topic .🤩
I love your videos 🎯💯
It’s a war that we have lost already
I'm telling you Johnny that's some dip research I appreciate keep them coming
Absolutely loved the video 🔥🔥 it was like a movie about geopolitics of chips.
1:31 what’s he holding
Johnny that was so bloody interesting. They need to start showing your vid in schools
Wishing China well. I don't want to hear a peep out of amerika.
Don't be calling China aggressive.  Unless you're using it as a compliment.  You know, the way they describe the design of cars. If it's a pejorative, you can't be calling China aggressive unless you call amerika aggressive
Yes thy Son is a Senior Wafer Fabricator in a bunnie suit! MWM
Did you get chipped. We stil lead the way! It still is in the Valley. VECCO@ Tech. Gates was an Intel patsy. Jobs was authentic. That’s why they extracted him. MWM  C Chips
Remember the last time the US embargoed an asian country for a major economic sector? That went well.... but yeah the US establishing chips in the states means China also has no real incentive to not invade taiwan with full force as there is another source for chips now unlike prior. Essentially the concern for the loss of taiwan and its chips may force that to happen.
You are missing the boat. Data entry is over along with data monitoring by individuals. You have been by passed by technology. You must not know the Valley. Most of what you said is BS.
Designed by Germany
Software development is not data entry . Services and no goods days are over. Specialize in manufacturing. The glorified Data Entry Coding has been removed by AI.
Wonderful We still need Analog. Data entry is still “ Coding.” MWM
I'm sorry, but no shit that really how are brain works,.😂🤣🤣
should be shamed for sensationalizing technological competition as a war in journalistic reporting. There is every reason to use acute language towards peaceful ends and disregard the rhetoric of Lockheed Martin suits and boots.
The SCV is ramping up Manufacturing of our Chips. CMP is going gang Busters! MWM
The science part was pretty vague (bad)
Bad choice of music in this video, full of weird bass.. or maybe my speakers are that good
I don’t even need to watch this video to know that there’s no war, there however is a battleground and a common place with a battle of economic growth
GRATITUDE brother  Love from INDIA 🇮🇳
How chips are made? Why china and USA can't make chips like Taiwan?
US, China VS India
So, if tech industry can produce transistors much smaller than blood cell, how it relates to vaccines and theories of nanotechnology in it?
The most advanced chips were not  purposely  made  for the   enhancement of  humanity but for the elimination of it..
Johnny can you do a piece on Andrew rate
opium wars
👍
Chip war The US is not trying to stop the tech transfer. (Note that micro chip for most missiles, planes , cars and not effected by the tech sanction. China already produces those chips.) But trying to slow the business development..ie growth.. for Not only China but Singapore Malaysia ie Asean , of course Japan Europe etc... Though US Knows that sooner or later the Chinese chip will overcome the tech handicapp just like the space tech did. .... why would they wanted to promote this sanction of tech business because it leads to the quicker downfall of the global currency. Can you see it .. Comment please.
Thankfully the US still has control of the more advanced manufacturing processes for chips, I can't see China replicating it too well after we pulled everyone out of China involved in the industry. I think Zeihan makes some good points about this "war"..
Good to see Johnny finally covering this. I sounded crazy when I brought this up a year and a half ago to people who turned me on to this guy.
Go China I am right behind you in your decisions
The difference between this conflict and the OG cold war is people nowadays don't have the concentration span to care about this one as much due to tiktok and reactionary content creators pushing new culture war issues every other week.
I stopped this video when you referred to Taiwan as a separate country from China Taiwan is apart of China Taiwan is like a province of China just like Hong Kong is Taiwan is like Alberta in Canada Alberta has its own provincial government that can make laws in Alberta but the federal  governance manages the entire country  China is treating Taiwan as a province     This is why the west needs to educate themselves do not take information at face value and believe it research research research until the truth prevails
Semiconductor chips manufacturing must be spread to most of the developing countries so the fight if egoistic 🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳 not destroy world order
Msnbc and Bloomberg explained this stuff in depth about a year ago … 🤷‍♂️
Taiwan is going to make the US pick a side. Are they a legitimate country and do they get protection?
Can someone please tell the music used at 10:34 .
Oh look its Satan and Beelzebub. I mean, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.
In the end China rules
It's more like chinese living in america VS chinese living in china
We all know US and NATO love wars,don't accept competitors..don't find any excuse please
I'm vietnamese,i though Trump doin these things first right, remember trade war ?
It is a chip. Meant to be insertrd in the mouth. So it can... Solve hunger. And taste good. But if this is a chip, then where is the dip? Or am I looking at him?  -Meatwad
Johnny: Oh look It's Steve Jobs and Bill Gates "Bill Gates Jump" Woman: Yes
A blockade is not a “poke”. Cuban Missile Crisis anyone?
My brother in the background   "Hey are chips that technical?? Never heard of Potatoe fuckin chips with transistors"  I'm like what the fcuk bro GET OUT
My brother in the background   "Hey are chips that technical?? Never heard of Potatoe fuckin chips with transistors"  I'm like what the fcuk bro GET OUT
the transistors themselves are NOT 2nm size. This is a misconception pushed by salesmen with big mouths. Those 2nm means the smallest feature on the chip. For example the distance between transistor gate fins. A single transistor is actually near an order of magnitude bigger.
india is also trying to attract such companies
Also explains why the prime minister of my country was in Washington last week. Chip manufacturing and making the tools for them was a thing they talked about a lot. At least thats what it looks like with the media coverage
what about that Lithuania got license for micro chip frow taiwan
hey Johnny - I'm curious if you would be willing to do a video on graphene? I think you'd do a great cover on it.
Officially from the most populated nation called INDIA.. we are completely dependent on china for these electronic items.. hope people and govt realise what is important instead of manufacturing genocides. Johnny thank you so much for all the information.   Note: genocides are back . India is leading its way this time. Can you do a video over this?  People in this nation instead of comparing with developed nations, they just want to compare with pakistan, afghanistan.. sad but reality. When a issue is raised they say that india is better than talibans and pakistanis.
Awesome content. Today's software is not as powerful as chip tech or SoCs. Fast AI is even dependent on that.
Biden probably got rich in the process.  Maybe those files in his Corvette had some secret designs.
24:21 Funny how when the US wants to end their dependency on other nations, but when other nations end their dependency on the US, is "authoritarianism" and "populism".
Death to globalisation.
Bit confused about the difference between Taiwan and Japan selling chips to America. Why were he cool with Taiwan but not Japan. He even said America became dependent on Taiwan?
I just wonder why the US doesn’t pledge allegiance to the Taiwan flag every morning
its a great video but johnny you had a bias cuz you are American but you should leave you bias behind, you were like if china gets the semiconductor war the world is gonna end.
Because they are ultimately fighting about different ideologies they have about the world. Lol Humans 🙄 Great vid bro, thanks!
i love how he overreacts things, like a summary of karen + professor.
This might just be my favorite JH video.  He has earned a place on YouTube for his geography explainers but my favorite videos of his are the ones that explain economic phenomena.
Pls do a true millitary comparison between India pak and China, everyone knows india has qualitative and quantitative advantages but pls go in detail
Taiwan is NOT a country
@16:16, the image of the strand of dna is actually two strands of dna and the IBM chip's reference to 2nm isn't a physical measurement of distance, its just a marketing tool like 4g being followed by 5g...4 a 5 are just used nominally to represent advances in the field. I respect the man that made this very, very educational video, but just want to clear up some things because I'm presuming this Youtuber is not formally trained in science, tech, engineering or math.  My jaw literally dropped when I saw the mislabeling of double stranded vs single stranded DNA because I dream for a scientifically literate world.
I work at Lam Research as an engineer and i’ve seen the volume of product halt to china and divert to different places in asia or returning to stock/decommissioning…. crazy time
1:50 Hi Nick!
Independent media “Taiwan is an integral part of China” https://youtu.be/I0MB7xfQuRs
Lol, "one China policy" much
Too much content with less real substance
New intel building is in Ohio ☠️☠️☠️
1:50 Hi Nick 👋
Empires can only last so long till the next superpower takes over.
Nancy Polosi visits TSMC.... TSMC's stocks, "oh shit".... Hammer time 🤣
Listen jack cornpop was a bad dude, and no other country produces ice cream cones like Ukraine, that's why I shave my hairy legs in the sun.
You forgot to mention boieng and air bus america almost had a fight over making planes with Europe..
One your best videos Johnny, said this sincerely. From an Aussie. ♡
Why are you giving so much credit to Biden but none to Trump, who made the biggest moves to cut China off at the knees?
I'm an engineer and you calling a semiconductor and a microchip the same thing triggered me
Excellent video thank you, the only issues I have with it is that you didn't go into the sources of high quality silicone and also you talked about they hypersonic missile somewhat incorrectly.  The missile itself isn't all that bad for the US mil to deal with, the problem is that China was able to develop the technology.
You have to understand that the world needs each other. For example, those ships to be made or even get used by us we need energy and the circle keeps going for YouTube to be watched we need those chips for me to watch you I need my samsung I don't think any nation or country can live without the other, and it might be dangerous even..
The way you explain whole tsmc and making hypersonic missile by China to gain leverage over usa is super amazing just vowwwww ❤️🔥👍
I'm sure Israel sold China most of the designs to China. Israel couldn't get a F22 because United States were worried about Israel handing it over. ISRAEL IS AMERICAS BIGGEST SPY THREAT.
Tedious reporting! thank you ;)
Bro make a video on chatgpt and AI...
What I really like about your video is I can instantly look for additional facts in the comment section just to realize that there were still many voids in your explanation, some of which are the importance of ASML technologies, the reason why China stands as the main consumers to said chips, the enterprises in China who bought the chips themselves, and et cetera. Nevertheless, you're still superb for hooking me up and explaining the concepts with such clarity (though there exists numerous drawbacks with this method, one of which is it stops me to develop an unbiased understanding of the full landscape about the issue)
Nice video
Great video
If it's war than the US has already lost.  China saids that they can produce chips at 8nm and the US is stuck at 10 nm.  I predict Intel will go fabless like AMD in less than 10 years.  TSMC may be getting all the head lines but Samsung keeps improving their process.
US block China from ISS, International Space Station 🌌🚀, China say ok we built our own Space Station. US block China from high Tech Silicon Micro Chip. China say ok we built our own EUV chip machine. US block Tech company with US technology from selling to China.🥴🙄👹👺👿 US also block experts from working for China.🚀🌌🤬 US imperial Dictator Authoritarian Totalitarian hegemony power. Inferior complex 🥴🙄😱🤬
This is turning into a chips channel
Propaganda shill Jonny do provide us a document where it says Taiwan is an independent country. I’ll wait  Also do talk to Cuba regarding the blockade   Thank you .
Thanks
This doesn’t add up. Biden and his whole family are in bed with China…. Why the sudden shock and change?
This move should have been done two years ago and if Trump was President it would have been done
Fuck those companies that sell chips to China they can go and sell it to Brazil
The big flaw in this narrative of course is that it’s not about China’s military at all. Japan was not a military threat and yet the US put a halt to their rise. Ironically the US is now supporting Japan’s militarization so they can be used in a proxy war with China. China is not a military threat to the US, it is however an economic threat. This is about the US trying to hold on to their hegemony.
Johny teaching what American curriculum couldn't in a century in 20 minutes!
Johnny Harris also doesn't mention the Chinese spy networking how are Academia is essentially owned by China and they seduce democrat politicians like Mr Slawell
Government can essentially put chips in human bodies through are fine and benevolent Healthcare System and they can do Mass surveillance without our knowledge and from within which is sickening and scary
China will fall or at least its government within 10 years if left alone, The poverty and money management are going down fast.
Land of the free...
dude,the editing, soundtrack and graphics are all fabulous, but the content is just a joke.litte tips:iphone  or missile,which one need more high end semic
I’m not much of a tech person and could never pinpoint the exact moment the world went from “having technology” to what it is today. But now I know I can blame the people who made transistors 🙃
U need to get to the point faster
Mister Harris got dibs on chip and dip.
Yeah we have some really serious social issues in this country that we need to figure out a lot of corruption a lot of canceling of certain individuals which destroys the wealth in this country I've been a victim for many years now we really need to take away term limits for politicians let them serve for as long as they want and also take people's right to vote away get rid of the 26th amendment as soon as possible
Okay so someone finally explained the GPU, and chip shortage.  This makes a ton of sense.
Times were simple when chips was what you ate for snacks😂
Ok that's why "Tata" Indian conglomerate decided to make chip of our own. US$90 billion investment. If somebody who can make it possible. Then it is them.
🤎💙💛💛🖤
China has no match for the US because America owned the patent....its just about chief labor that China has....if US tranfer back their factory to the Philippines which originally lots of qualified and abundant of workforce....
Why are you still at 3.45 mill'?  You should atleast be at 15 mill' now.
Lol US is very petty.
This new World Lore update is really good! can't wait for the next episode!!
always love to watch your story its like a movie to me hehe =),,intense but dont want to happen the worst case scenario..keep it cool man godbless..
That's a nice clip. More things to block China for being aggressive.
The problem with history is that we learn nothing from history! China is a communist country, and people have forgotten that! Soldiers died fighting those comis, and that they killed over 60 million of their own people! Our politicians should be prosecuted for treason!
The part about the UV stuff in Netherlands is absolutely crucial for the process, nor USA, Taiwan or China can do that yet, so Taiwan, USA and China still depend on Netherlands.
Well hopefully the semiconductor plants in Ohio, AZ, and Texas will help, once they are in production, unfortunately the new car market is being effected right now too.
Silicon Valley will be devastated to be called central California
Unplug....go fishing...no silicon needed.
I'm really glad you finally made a video about this. It's the biggest reason why Russia is going after Ukraine to get full access of chips to optimize and stay ahead in their AI weapons amongst other things. Good job 👏
silicon is even in my wifes boobs
When Trump sounded the alarm about China that was racism because Orange Man Bad. As soon as Biden was elected being anti China became morally correct. Exactly the same as when Mitt Romney sounded the alarm about Russia and Obama, Clinton and Democrats ridiculed him.
I am surprised that your video implies that China isn’t (or can’t yet) make chips or FABS to lithographically print chips themselves. I can imagine that if they didn’t possess the technology to do so, it wouldn’t be too long for them to be able to do this (?)  Would that be the same with India?
Great video!  Nice work
Informative but tooo biased. China is a super power as well.
Taiwan should install a full self destruct system in their fabs and threaten to destroy it all if China invades.
This is so awesome I wish schools like this back in the 80s.
Good video.  Espionage.  That's how China is going to catch up unfortunately.
😂😂😂
If I am not wrong, Hypersonic weapons which are relatively big machine..like washing machines or cars. They don't require small chips to become intelligent. So.. d restrictions to prevent d acquisition of small advance chips are not really about  military might. It is about economic competition
Only thing I've learned is that you're obsessed with chips

Can't wait for proper channels to dig into this one! The debunks are gonna be good!
Love your videos! So much value! ❤
I would say that most analog film cameras have some semiconductors in them, at least going back to the mid 70's
Corporate greed did this to us. We need to fuck up China
oh so that's why Bill Gates suddenly invested in chatGPT
America shouldn't trusted and doing business with communist regimes in china that violeted human right and  still in power for a long time, since the collapsed of the Soviet union,  but we are NOT. We  allowed communist china  to servived and  taking  advantages of us economically  in the name of WTO or global cheap labors and cheating America for decades. DO NOT TRUSTED COMMUNIST CHINA periods.
I think America needs to solve the problem of their fabs, and not rely so heavily on Taiwan, not completely abandon them. But find an in between.
Logical gates
Poor and helpless planet Earth. Psychos dominates everywhere...
When will be the best time for China to strike though?
No, America is too preoccupied with gender-identity in abortion rights. That's why China is going to blow right past. But at least we got whats most important to Americans covered right.
Damn I want to eat some chips
Conspiracy theorists getting it right again🤔 But of course our country has been sold out like a cheap “‘made in China” toy. It’s too late, either we reinvent the modern chip or go to war. China wants power and US congress and greedy tech companies have no country in mind to save.
The biggest surprise is that US companies can't make the most advanced chips despite having access to EUV machines and not being sanctioned. This shows that having EUV machines is not the only thing required to make chips. You need other machines and skilled cooks.   This is why the US prodded TSMC to build another chip plant in Arizona and bring their engineers along.
You ready to be our next president 😅?
Excellent content
bro the US coast guards are better than the chinese military navy
You forgot to mention the dildo made of silicone
Moving FABS to Taiwan, the rich of US profited. Selling China those chips, the rich of US profited. Abandoning to sell chips but selling tech to China to produce the chips themselves, the rich of US profited. Abandoning to sell the tech and pouring tax payers dollars to US FABS, the rich of US profited. It looks like average Joe is getting fkd from right and left while becoming poorer, yet he's the loudest cheerer for "own" interest of them all LMAO
China used the West's greed against itself. 😂
Fabs really are remarkable. Some of the most automated facilities in the world, and they require almost complete retooling when wafer sizes change every few years. I worked in the space creating high purity gas lines for some of the bigger tool makers and the market is a constant cycle of boom and bust.
They're not magic ✨ Chips are meant to be eaten  Jalapeno Kettle Chips are best
Still wearing that unwash beanie.
A Reese's peanut butter cup from trader Joe's
Fantastic breakdown of a complex issue. Thank you.
US scared of losing power
China bought out the us they are letting to the lead.
You're like fox news, CNN,  Linus tech tips and Mr.Ballen all in one 🤣
the last i heard china was bankrupt, and is putting on a brave face to the world like its the leader of the world not the u.s. and what is even crazier is jr ( canada's prime monster) is welcoming their government to our shores in b.c. for military games........... the free world is in huge trouble if china some how out smarts the u.n. the united states may be singing the chinese national anthem soon if jr isnt removed from office.................
I'm addicted to Reese cups as well
Let's talk about Israel's involvement in this high stakes game of high tech dominance
When US has tech Advantage：Open your door When US behind on tech：Get out of my door
We've been in economic warfare for 20 years or more - the U.S. just recently figured it out.
Oh no, poor Nvidia took a hit in their stock. They must be crying in RTX 40 series dollars. so sad :(
If it were American made we would have no problem
It is ironic that you ate a peanut butter chocolate from Trader Joe. Trader Joe trades globally. To go back to isolationism from globalization, just because you can't compete, is like withdrawing from the Olympics because you can't win the gold.
The right thing for the US to do, is to spend more on education. Blocking China will just hurt the US companies, meanwhile not making the US more competitive.
I love your long vids❤🎉🔥
Should China actually block chips to the US or other parts of the world, the US will undoubtedly go to war.
China can make their own most of their chips without any US technologies. It will only promote China to be independent technologically from the US.
American chip manufacturing will fail or at least won't be very profitable. Americans are just not educated and hard working currently. American government needs to spend more education, than their military. That is what is wrong with the US. The fear of educating the American population, because then they won't be able to manipulate the "democracy".
You are just wrong. New chips are only useful in newest cellphones. Weapons need stable reliable older chips, not the newest smallest chips. New chips need the Chinese market to have enough profit for their research. Without Chinese market, the US chip companies will make so much less profit that their stock values will plummet, which will be detrimental in their long term prospect.
The biggest military blunder is underestimating the hunger of your adversary and the loyalty of your own. Many politicians were in on the cash from selling u.s tech to Chinese businesses by way lobbying and loops holes.
I threw everything with silicon at the wall and now it's time to throw this phone! BYE YALL!!!
Make a video on rare earth.. one step before chips
omg people are so oublivious even smart guys sometimes it's just depressing, yeah here in Europe we have stopped sharing architecture with chinese for some time but they are really bizarre over there + them suporting putin and Ukraine War is disgusting. Hope chinese youth does something soon.
Mouthpiece of usa 😍
Seems like American capitalist and financial experts forgot a simple lesson.   Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Now you have a major nationally important resource being made out of your country next to a rival superpower. Stellar planning
lithography and design are what hold china back. Plus they are repressive with idea sharing a important part of innovation.
you should just do a joe rogan interview type podcast.. open minded interviews would be awesome you'd be so good at it
I am sorry that China and Russia feel bullied by USA... But chips, engineering, ML, fusion, and war fighting, manufacturing, first principle thinking and finance, energy and food independence. Well, it only sucks more to be left behind...
Are you done with Vox? Is Vox gone? 😢 Great video
Forgot in all this is trump you liberals/lefties instead of getting on board wanted to call him a racist… mind you to the same thing that is being done… the left are morons
Anyone else just constantly frightened for where humanity is heading? In every way; technologically, spiritually...
lol us 🐱
Their tits... silicon. Their valley... silicon.
If China's move is to impose a blockade to merchant ships trying to get chips to the US from Taiwan, than the obvious move for the US is to send a military escort with merchant ships. I mean that's what seems to be the obvious move to me anyways. Then China has to choose to either back off or directly engage the US military. Something tells me China doesn't really wanna dance that bad with the US and thus they'd back down and go back to the drawing board.
As the world becomes more interconnected, world powers have shifted from positive punishment (introducing a negative stimulus like a hot militaristic war) to negative punishment (depriving access to a positive stimulus, like essential economic goods).
I'm not really interested in this particular topic, but your channel has 1st ammendment value and as such... I shall watch.  Continue the good work, my friend. Independent, unbiased and in-depth reporting by the people... for the people.
liberal hack
*Black Ops fans arise!* 🗿
I ain’t worried.. the usa is so ahead it’s not even funny.. we are giving away military equipment  because we need room for new shit constantly it’s crazy.. our 5gen fighter jet the best jet in the world is like 35 years old..
But if, just if, United States are the bad guys who has enemies everywhere. I can't imagine nowadays living in a country without cellphone, computers and stuffs like that. And i can't imagine Chinese people doing so.
The most important thing Johnny said here was “weapononizing economic interdependence” - very true. When these nations were becoming interdependent, they didn’t think some of them would intend to weaponize it. It shows why many empires of the past aimed to be 100% self sufficient.
This video is mediocre. There is no such thing as us or China military supremacy. They all can destroy the world with nukes, all of them can't concern each other. So there is no difference who shoot first
Well done I will like & subscribe 👏
North Korea and China have been working together against the US. I don't blame the US for taking risk management steps. Biden is NOWHERE near my top president list, but that was a wise move to protect the US.
This is the stuff of science fiction. Wars over tech and micro chips. Scary stuff. Seems like we are on the edge of major conflict, now with nuclear powers... let's all hope cooler heads prevail
Future combat are robots of whoever civilization standoutsmark my words and pin this
the iphone took things too far. we need to go back.
Let me tell you about the coming fight over crisps
Would you ever consider a podcast where you deep dive into different topics?
Very interesting. Thank you
Thank you for the education
insane that you haven’t talked about iran yet
We need to protect our chip shops!
Us always win coldwar and civilwar
Hey Johnny, Thanks for the content. It`s really detailed and interesting. I might imagine the amount of work that goes into making a single video.  I was watching your videos without subscribing, sorry for that, but now I am.  Keep it up. Also, a motivation for others to subscribe and take benefit of this channel.
it's amazing that the silicone, which is extracted from the boring, inert sand, and then magic laser machine turn it into artificial brains which used to operate the internet, which is essentially global network of artificial electronic brain 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
It seems that he is not aware of what is happening in Taiwan. After Nancy Pelosi's charade in Taiwan, there was an election. The Pro China Party won the elections. So no one will invade anyone, Taiwan will be the part of China.
Why do you make China sound like this evil country, testing nuke and building military weapons and all. As a matter of factor the U.S first tested nuke, and was the only government ever nuked civilian population, it has slot more weapons than china. Aircraft carriers, planes and all. Who is the real scary government here. Who is just wanting to defend themselves and have a chance to say no to the big bully. Please speak facts.
makes me hate USA even more for making Japanese chips down. Japan could've sold to other countries tho.
I would love to see Johnny do a video on Bostons Big Dig
been going on a loooooong time.
I graduated in computer programming in 1992 with 95% and never got hired except from my own company.  They do not only compete illegally, but, also, team up to violate human rights and other rights.  I'm offered money in law school against them, since, they make too much money and abuse it.
don't understand why us companies still have manufacturing in China, a hostile nation. Ship those manufacturing to allied countries.
Well made!   Really interesting. Love your energy!
Thank you
Hello Johny, please investigate this. It’s a coverup : New Brunswick·CBC Investigates No longer a sure thing: Records show how N.B. investigation into mystery illness changed over time
It started with the downing of mh317
cool
It’s hilarious that Reagan put the USA in this superconductor problem, all by crushing Japan’s startup because his greed was too strong
16:06 I believe the IBM chip was 12nm not 2nm. 2nm is just an industry naming scheme. But 12nm is still very small, but not smaller than DNA!
#TaiwanNumbaOne!!
USA surrendered to China officially on 110320. Details are not hammered out just yet. Not going to be a good outcome for any humanity, however.
Very intresting video!
Fuck the US, they're screwing everyone over just cuz scawy scawy china is buying chips
last video: Chips now: another chips
Usa will Win
Happy Chinese New Year!!!
GREED! Greed got us in this position
This is objectively the best thing Biden has done in office tbh.
bro just start a podcast!!!!
This is just straigth anti-communist propaganda lol painting china as the evil country and usa as the inocent one lol
They invest all this money into war but can't get autonomous vehicles right
Danke!
More info: book - Chip War, by Chris Miller
I can listen to you all day
Well, U.S banned China from the international space station program and guess what, China got their own. Similarly, the 5G technology which China is more advanced than any country in the world. Yes at this moment China is behind the U.S, but I can already see they are catching up really fast, let’s give it a few more year and see what’s gonna happen, my bet is the advantages for the U.S having now won’t last much longer. And bad luck to Taiwan, since they no longer have the silicon shield anymore due to the TSMC is moving to the states, China will no longer have any concerns to reunite Taiwan with military forces. Game over Taiwan
Johnny, what's ur stake on quantum computing?will it be a game changer
Hey Johnny,  amazing Video
Awesome video
Great video
I think this whole thing is about AI. Thats the new super weapon.    Sure the military needs chips, but I highly doubt you always need the high end chips for that and china can get older chips and even produce them. For example when building a hyper sonic missile, the least of your problems is having top of the line silicone. With AI, you do actually need that keep up.
Yeah, Cold War II is here with China and Russia. Communist China does not tell everyone how much money they are spending on their military, that is another big thing that is not talked about as well. We need to start spending more as well, we need to make sure we never have another 9/11 or Pearl Harbor ever again!
As someone who’s lived in the capital of Silicon Valley for the last 20 years we are not from central California , this is Northern California lol literally right next to / inside the Bay Area
U do know that a hypersonic missile has more components than just a microchip right? Also, there's no such evidence of such a test by China other than China's own claims and we all know how China fake claim most things ranging from GDP data to Covid data.
Taiwan might survive from China I think But who would ever know the end?
Oh my god Scaler conquered This channel as well
USA cut China off from space-station. Look at China now.
while timestamps are too advanced of a technology, I appreciate introducing the yellow timer in the ad section
Russia being outdated trying to control oil is no longer a treat and US and EU are not afraid just cautious of nukes from Russia
It’s a shame the people who run the country can’t learn to share all and get along always is one up man ship it out dated by now for god sake scribbling like rich school Kids
Microchips and semi conductors are what powers our modern world day in and day out, it's become a mineral resource everyone is after!!
Whoooo what "bringing jobs back to America". Something Trump didn't do, whaaaat didn't see that coming.
Chips are hiding in your windows, they're snatching your people up
US sold tech to China so that they could be a threat to US, thus prompting a needed boost to US military funding.  Brilliant ! 🤦🏻‍♂️
This war, to those who read on politics and are invested in economics and politics have been in discussions since 2018. That’s before corona. This is one of many micro wars being played out for years without resolution. It’s easy to see, difficult to predict and impossible to solve without big action.
And transistors change ourlives!!!
Well explained
Worry about sending China all the tech happened under orange man bad. Like seriously please disconnect. You're spreading nothing but propaganda.
Sillicon chips are the brain of circuit and technology
Basically, orange man bad was the best leader we've had in almost 100 years and the communists/fascists did everything they could to get him out of power to support dog eaters rise.
We did live better than you can imagine before this Tec shit you just don’t understand because you have never seen it and the good bit will be the fat cats can’t control us trust me this is the truth
The way you choose and narrate your content content demonstrates your American exceptionalism
C'mon u either preparing us or putting that fear..lol  I'm ver grateful to know that i still live under a rock y'all can have this but i won't just sit as if it won't affect my family  So to God i leave in his hands☝️
They better build a couple of fabs deep deep inside a couple of extremely large mountains for good measure.
16.59 is inaccurate propaganda. It shows all is either taiwan or s korea. Intel kept making chips in the US, and had dominance of the pc/server sector.
Is this why I still can't get a PS5?
Super but need to cut down on overacting!!
If we keep democrats in power we will never win
Thanks for making this video. I worked in the semiconductor industry in the past decade and while I'm familiar with some of the policies, some of the moves didn't really make sense to me without understanding the underlying situation. This video helped explain a lot of the missing pieces in the relationship and supply chain that helped me understand why certain things happened in my industry in the past decade.
Didnt russia built HM way before anyone eles lol?
It's like a reverse brain drain 🤣 Amazing word
Um... Do you know that South Korea is the largest microchip manufacture in the world? And China is relying on South Korea's microchips, not the US. In this video, you didn't mention how important South Korea is.
dOWN IN oHio cHips in OHio
This is a chip race now. The soviet and us had a space race.
my money is on the country that invented microchips.  thats all i gotta say
Our fuqking politicians created this mess in the first place. It started from the early nineties. Even a smart child can smell the stink a block away. Now they’re acting like they are the smart one solving the problems. Anyone who doesn’t know how this was started in the 90’s would believe these democratic and the RHInO vomit.
White men are losing. Well at least they still win with the Asian ladies compared to Asian men. Happy for ya losers 🤣
Can ANYONE on this planet explain why the USA has decided to build its fancy new chip fabs, which require an incredible amount of water, in a desert.
Biden didn’t do shit. Trump was the one putting a stop to China military exceeding and their 5G Huawei including Belt and Road Initiative.
The Reason, THEY LOOK LIKE Tramps. Now, they're gonna Make You look like Amsterdam.
Biden is definitely gonna win this war.
~😱~ mind blown!
Chips act is a JOKE. Need to like 10-20x that amount to keep up. There are individual companies committing hundreds of billions
'Magic Laser Machine'
Me living in the US: AH $H!T HERE WE GO AGAIN-
The Trader Joe's peanut butter cups are way better than that trash that the company Reese's makes. They are not one in the same
Wrong! It's a war we can see via this channel 😃
Amazingly informative piece, with your typical irreverent humor. For some reason in the last ten minutes or so I wondered what would happen if we built fabs in Ukraine or similar unstable political locations. Talk about pissing off both the Russians and Chinese. That would do it.
chips, potato chips
This video just earned u a new subscriber
You make China again look like the maniac guy obsessed of making advanced weapons. While cool Americans are protecting the world by starting this economic war. Also, almost nothing mentioned about ASML.   You oversimplified it and you really worked hard to make Americans look like the good guys in this conflict.
so this is why gpu so expensive
Because Reagan wasn't about free market, he was about ensuring the rich got richer. Free markets just usually make that easier but if he could do something else to augment it then that's great for him also
Damn Captain Queenan was right
My question is, how did we ever sold those chips to them in the first place? Who allowed it?
The difference is that most things with chips don't need the advanced chips that are behind the competition. Tons of places can make you a chip for a toaster
Beautifully explained, sir.
Make a video about the kobalt mines in the Congo ??
Could you please make a video about the arab spring.
China technology R&D budget are astronomical big, but almost nothing new come up from China. Can you make video about why that happened, because the Chinese academically very smart....thank you 🙏
Oil and chips are controlled by US ? Nope we don't want a monopoly company.
(BASS NOISE)
Time stamp??
Worrying commenced 🫡
bro your videos are awesome 👏🏾  you make learning so intresting.
Just like the Bronze Age.
Do a video on the cobalt mines in Africa
Great content as always… 👍🏾
Big construction going on in the Phoenix area. IBM building a new microchip plant
for the glory of this land of freedom has to be destroyed china and russia 🗽🇺🇲
Western bias. They think nonhwestern people have no creative abilities and poor intelligence. It is a racist video.
You missed a huge bit... The ASML (EU) has the lithography machine market cornered. They are also trying to boost chip manufacturing on the continent. Going to be interesting to see this unfold
About time. Let China ROT.
please ai history
This video is amazing. I think China already manufacturing there own chips, MediaTek if I’m not mistaking is a Chinese company  Obviously not as big as the TSMC or Intel it’s still …
And as Always the germans supply both parties of the war with their weapons. Zeiss Optics.
Can you explain the DMZ sometime, the wall that splits Korea?
Yes Johnny, start a podcast and talk about ANYTHING!
you forgot to mention the major investment of the usa in semiconducter in Europe. Alone the investment in Germany from the USA is giagantic. Hopefully there will be no war, but i‘m not so sure … sadly. Europe and Asia are changing and this will make major shifts in the world
Funny to see its seen as  "OK" for the US to cut chip supply to China. People should understand almost all countries are dependent on China for Cheap manufacturing and thinking America is the centre of the World is not going to play well in the long run. The Rise of Asia will be a thing to watch for.
I love the tone you set on this; 'there's a revolution happening'. A very important piece to note as it happened silently to most people.
We never should have shared our computer technology with the rest of the world. I'm serious.
I have once seen a Documentary about the magic laser machines from the Netherlands and I think to remember that the are only possible to build with some insane technology that comes from Germany and only they can produce.
25:05 Explains why the RTX 40-series is so much more expensive than the RTX 30-series at MSRP.
wow first time saw your video and I love it  you got a new active subscriber
I am glad Johnny stated Taiwan is it’s own country
It is very interesting Video, thanks! I am actually a part of this supply chain. I make the ASP Sensors ASML unses for thier machines.
Lil bro claims that he likes maps but in the thumbnail he placed china and use on the wrong sides xD
I don't want atheistic empire rule world
You know, in a backwards rounded kind of fashion.. you could just transport the buildings individually into the US. Move all the equipment into foundations like the box home that Elon musk is making but stronger, and transport it all in a single sweep that china would either have to attack or let happen.
Hello..ASML
If we went to the moon why can't they pull the shit out of storage and go tomorrow
Thank you for sharing.  I love your channel.
Great video
usa steals oil from Syria...and can't compete with China on ai and space then steal tsmc and forbid everyone to do business with China or sanction their ass
This guy might as well read wikipedia articles for you. Go find information somewhere reliable, he is not trustworthy.
,👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
It was hard to see how you glossed over how silicone and computer logic works. I get that you wanted to gloss over the technical part to get to the politics. But please do not pretend to explain it in detail and then skip it like its magic. It made me suspicios that the rest of the video might be as bad and that suspicion never went down after the beginning. And of course that suspicion was activated again each time you oversimplified something.
Nice ❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍👍👍👍
🇺🇸 YOUR READING A SCRIPT FROM CIA NSA USA MILITARY PROPOGANDA!
🇺🇸 DUDE... AMAZON,  GOOGLE,  MICROSOFT,  APPLE,  INTEL. QUALCOMM,  CISCO,  spaceX e.t.c ARE FINANCED BY CIA NSA MILITARY AND ALL HAVE TTRILLIONS OF $$$$$ CONTRACTS WITHN MILITARY!     Your CHANNEL IS FULL OF CIA NSA  Military PROPOGANDA!
The war goes a lot deeper than microchips, my friend
Thanks
this is good fiction story!  please do some studies... go talk to some old pioneers in this 'chip' evolution! You got all backwards..
I'm sorry to say but i found the video very biased even u claim to be independent journalist. U mentioned that whole chip war is based on an argument that China is using chip of American technology for their military. There are few points that r wrong. First, what chips does America use for its military? So American military is allowed to MILITARIZE chips but China can't?  Ok ur point is those are American chips. Is it? Is it really American technology? That second point. America brain drain every single country. And bring all thr talent into America. Then when some technology is ready that American technology. But hey... China isn't allowed to do that. Why? Ah... communist country. That's why...  Really? That's ur excuse? That's why i said u r biased and failed to show US hypocrisy. China is a tread to US because US is afraid to compete. Like u said. If can't compete them, join them. But US can't join China, then who gonna call itself LEADER of the free world (idk when free world voted for US to be a leader, just bcz u have deep pockets and urs guns are bigger so u call urself leader. That's the very definition of Dictatorship)
I think we have to push China just like Russia with this war a few steps back. Taiwan likes its independence, I think we all should support them against tyrannical dictatorships. Cant help but remind myself of what happened to the Alibaba founder, all his sweat and work gone to waste because China is insecure, and this shows a fundamental flaw in how these countries are run.  If you have no real pros and experts (not those that are just for show in the west), you land in China territory of locking ppl into factories, factories to dormitories just to repead the cycle again. We all know how that reflected into the Chinese tech industry, they rather work for scraps than waste their lives as defacto and dejure slaves. ITS ABOUT TIME WE GIVE THE COMMUNISTS A GOOD KICK IN THEIR BALLS, as they say "BE HUMBLE OR GET HUMBLED"!  China, just like Russia are the Dogs that BARK but CANT BITE, I think its about time to direct these, tech stealing abusers, human rights abusers, genocide infusers, propagandists and antagonist ideology fanatics. ITS TIME TO send them to their right place, below the ppl that work themselves to death, so you can have your fucking Iphone. Below of those horrific views of nets these Chinese companies have to set up to reduce the number of suicidal ppl closed into these sweat shops.  THE WEST HAS ITS OWN FAULT, I decided to not get another APPLE product after I heard the scandals, Im very happy with Samsung and South Korea at least they have a soul, unlike the CCP!
Back to The USA doesn't have friends, only interests, no matter if US government officials and corporations take money from China. Can always count on American GREED like no others in the world, and of course the megalomaniacs. Look at even how much Idiocracy is allowed to be megalomaniac, seriously believing that fit to be presidents of The United States of America That's because western Oligarchs make sure that Zombies think so much more than should about ownselves That's being realistic about how it is. That's extremely dangerous and frankly insane.
Moral of the story, everyone acts based on self-interests. No one gives a f**k about Taiwan. Only uses it as proxy to gain competitive advantages.
The ones who run the USA, china, russia,uk,EU... THE WORLD ARE THE SAME stop trying to convince people otherwise
''So all will have more'' lol
Thank you. I learned a lot from this video. In 50 years this might also count as Bidens biggest achievement.
No wonder Taiwan has surpassed the US into the semiconductor industry. Im not very informed in the subject but I heard many times that they can reduce the size of the chip only so far, someone mentioned "The Atom" to me this sounds mind-blowing can we even reach that level?!  I have my doubts.
Being SCALER Student , @SCALER sponsoring right people and course is great .
I'm NGL movies show US as the place where ai take over the world, but I'm sure China is Gonna be the start.
Not everything that's smart has silicon in it.. my ex gf umm  ...
Taken long enough as China has and still stealing Western technology and we need to stop them
All this talk about chips is making me hungry lol
A lot of semiconductor companies is "exiting" China due to the conflict, at the same time a lot of new semiconductor companies with similar scope as those "exiting"  are popping up in China and cooperating with those exiting companies.   The thing is the world is not run by superpowers, but instead capitalism
Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan was a shake down that why she took her son , who just happened to do a whole lot of business deals while he was there and she was telling Taiwan the us has your back
Who made silicon ?
Politics like this seems like such a joke sometimes like the "right" move is to do something that wouldn't necessarily warrant escalation but that's just guessing like say China decides to blockade taiwan that doesn't necessarily warrant US military action, but the at the same time the US could just decide to take it personally and blow the boats out of the water. What counts as "the line" and "too far" doesn't really exist
Currently the industry outside of computers and mobile phones does not need the most advanced chips. I don't know about the military equipment like the hypersonic missile, but I guess they also use more low tech but more reliable chips. Not to say the most modern chips are not essential to military since more and more data is collected, like with the F35 fighter jet, you need supercomputers to process them and help the command to get a better picture of the battlefield than the enemy. Like the system US gave to Ukraine and they build on it. The battlefield overview helps them fight back against stronger and bigger army.
"If the cash is there, we do not care" is the capitalists motto
If society ends over fucking silicon chips imma be mad fr fr 🫠
TSMC and ASML is a decade ahead of China.
Fkg arrogant American
you missed so much about ASML
Trump helped avoid a war by bringing in the regulations he did on semi conductors, it set back any war by 5-10 years. Joe Biden did shit all there all trump era programs and policies
You are the prettiest girl in video journalism
This video is incredible, amazing job
What Taiwan  doing with U.S IS same as What Saudi did With 🇺🇸🇺🇸 without Prejudice To Any Other State!! Ik  This Fact  needs no mention and shouldn't be out in the Public but We Folks, Respect Fact and always  love to go there to in orders study more  🙏 about them so that we are able to become a part of the Revolution. Hopes are high; In making sense and difference  🙏
Even my girl has got silicon in her
i'm craving pringles now
from doritos to microchips is quite awesome series hehe
i dont agree with 2nm and it seems impossible. 5nm does, the limit of ulsi (ultra large scale integration) chip and processor.
The transistor does not send a 1 or a 0.  It controls the flow of current in a way that is interpreted as a 1 or a 0.  Physical layer
I believe China will succeed in making their own cutting edge Chips one day and cut off dependence on US Chips
Love the video, but what do we do with this information?
How much of the chips going to China is going into the military?? May be like 0.01%?? So in order to stop China’s economic rising, to kill a few river bugs you need to poison the whole bloody river! Nevermind, the China has already found a way. Its photonic chip facilities will be up and running soon and thanks to you racists America and the sick West an entire industry chain will be formed. 1.4 billion and tens millions overseas will not back the f down.
Are you really sure that the US won’t throw tons of weapons onto China? Isn’t that the whole point of the military?  Shovelling tax money to shareholders of military equipment producers?
Keep up the jokes LOL
先炸了中南海的肉食者们
It is totally nonsense to compare China to the Nazis. Such biased view. I would call this evil.
Tiny pieces of silicon 😅
As a U.S. sailor it has been critical for me understand why I’ve been deployed to the South China Sea to “ensure free navigation of international ships” in recent years. There is a lot of monitoring of Chinese vessels involved with that.
I’ve known about this for awhile. But its nice to see him tell political normies. Fun fact Russia has some of the gasses used in in those magic lasers. Neon I believe it’s called. Yet they are still supplying it to the world.
so the netherlands has power these days they make the machines to make the chips :P
John Harris speaking to my geopolitical soul.
Well done and informative video.
Still the Netherlands could eff em both and let them need a decade to have the same level again
Silicon chips are future oil..and again usa is trying to take control over chip supply as they did on oil supplys via usd.
Did he say microchips are metals?
18:54 nice to see that johnny harris also believes that pakistan should not exist lol 😂
exactly the same during 1939, selling tech to Nazi !!!
Ruined the whole video with the add alone brother....oh this is all around us.. we should watch out for this... but support scaller pick your battles
Finally, people are starting to understand the importance of technology and its part in the world stage!
Wow. He talks like he discovered silicon.
man...
America, the free-market capitalist crusader has uprooted the Japanese chip industry for their own sinister imperial interests.
Where can I buy the map you put at the back ?
I've worked in a white room (clean room) before.
China is a big customer of microchips because it produces most of the world's electronic devices not just because it wants to build an advanced military. Of course you won't say that since the entire video is based on a biased and paranoid narrative of the Americans towards China as usual.
Great video, i wanted yo know what China is doing in order to catch up or even surpass the US in this industry, I personally don't believe that invading Taiwan is the only way to go to solve China's chip problems. I am sure they might have alternatives which I mostly wanted to know. Hope u can make another video about it. Anyway thanks for the great work.
14:21 Did he just say "Prime Minister of Taiwan"? 🤦‍♂Ugh. So disappointed in Johnny for that mistake.
The war i dont give a rats ass about lol
Hopefully we here in India also make some. Earlier govt tried but not able to achieve much.
I love watching your videos so much
I am amazed what a huge work is done behind the scene. Appreciate your work and interesting topics
14:46 love it!
Pull that beanie on properly mate. Bloody annoying.
One of the good moves by this administration
Buy weapons from America and use them to attack America. I feel like we have been here before.

China is ageing America is busy with political correctness and an Alzheimer's patient as president Japan is ageing It's India that is at its demographic dividend and an entrepreneurial population that will drive the semiconductor buisness it's India that will win the race .
P L E A S E cover cobalt mining next. It’s current day slavery and it is being minded in truly horrific ways. And is absolutely one of the most if not thee most covered up big tech related thing currently and recent history.
I have an odd counter view: This silicon race represents the last human war. The key is "brain-like". We're manufacturing brains. That's never happened before. And at the rate we're going, we've got a decade left. After that, who knows?
India in picture or
The end is near🤔👻😇
Making money is an art, you can only make money if you practice and master the art..... by the way I enjoyed watching your videos. a fellow creator----==--
This hasn't been just chip technology, this has been a trade war. Huawei Google Android ban was in 2019 by Trump. Huawei was competing with Apple, exceeding technology over Apple and the ban happened. Huawei was also leading 5G and most western nations were pressured to ban or not use Huawei 5G over security in 2018.
Like how Kashmir is a territory of China in this video. I don't know whether its because China is in the title and assume chinese people watch it or this channel is also going the western media route
0:59 Because your life depends on chips. Pringles FTW "China will make its own chips" Absolutely right-in 2017 China made an unlikely breakthrough!  After years of research, China has finally figured out how to make ballpoint pens
This is fake history pushing fake narratives. For children.  It's impossible to invade your own country for one.
like your videos but why are all of them demonizing the US?   Aren't you and everyone in your company citizens?  I guess just get the global views and feed off of the conflict.   also look into traders joes if you love them so much....
The victor in this entire conflict, remaining in the shadows and claiming the spoils…  is TSMC.
Bahahahaha, I love seeing America getting screwed.  It’s beautiful   But also, what’s that old saying about chickens and roosting
Thank You)
18:12 is fake news. Most of the lithography machines (magic laser machines) that ASML makes in the Netherlands go to Taiwan. US doesn’t supply those. Please fix or comment.
Uncle sam doesn't like so see China becoming super power. Gist of the video.
Hi Johnny I'm a big fan of your work and love your videos but a promotion from Scaler really threw me off guard. I hope you did all your research about Scaler just like you do for all your videos.
Freaking love your videos!
Nice! Awsome, and great presentation!  i am a great fan of your videos from Bangladesh!
Disappointed he didn't eat Doritos at the end.
So they use lasers to engrave silicone for energy to be transfered & managed on a micro scale? Sounds like sacred geometry is the pinicle of this tech then?
China is the SMART one here, All USA can do is poke and intidimate Big Brother China.
Both countries are far beyond corrupt. Don’t give any F’s
Watch this on 2x speed, man talks slow on purpose to drag the video out. Also, sponsor shill in a 30 minute video, as if YouTube won't pay him already.
18:24 JH: “… its a recipe for peace and prosperity…” Theres still half a video left
This was great, and I'm a big fan of your videos. Can you please do a video on the rivalry between Cisco and Huawei? There is defo more to this than the mainstream media are portraying. It's basically China Vs USA.
Americans and west spending billions of dollars in R&D just so that Chinese can stole them.
Really like your content but can't you get a gopro with image stabilization or something?  The shaky-cam thing is my only (hopefully constructive?) complaint.
And it all requires PETROLEUM. You liberals are idiots...... chips so we can blow billions of dollars defending ukraine? The United States is on a very fast track to collapse under the Biden regime and direction we are headed
Crap talk...China will produce better and more advance chips in no time.  And US will be totally price out of the market with little or no marketable product left for its economy.
how much is white house paying you for this lame propaganda video ? 👀  i hope its big enough to buy your low integrity value
They will destroy themselves and they don't see it coming..bet
Hey, can you imagine where we would be if we combined our knowledge instead of this dumb ass competition to see which country is better? Humans are pretty pathetic.
Technology is moving at the speed of light as far as Earth's timeline is concerned.
Its ridiculous that the main goal of most governments is to have the strongest military.. that says alot about where humanity is heading
I’m so glad you made this video to help clear up what’s going on in the semiconductor industry. Me, line many, had to get laid off because of this. Now I just want to know when will this have a resolution so I can get my job back…
Taiwan is not a country！This is the consensus of the United Nations
Keep researching bud, you got a lot wrong.
I remember US told Sweden not to sell their chip-making machine to China?
More spying u-boats please! And tips for other Nebula subscribers watch his latest on submarines.
Its funny 😂😂 that how in less then a decade China became from USA's biggest trading partner to a THREAT to USA.  a THREAT,  just because China has grown as a power to counter USA's dominance,  I mean China  was never a democracy at that time it didn't bother US gov but in last 10 years suddenly they realized, ooh China is a dictatorship, they violate human rights in their factory, but USA was not giving  a fu** about human rights when there companies were benefitting from it.
You can only delay China's technology but can't make it stop, the best solution is to help India and south-east Asian countries to develop their economy to counter China.
Good analyst video
Very nice video.  Not a fan of Biden or Pelosi but like what they are doing with chips and Taiwan
Im not sure your informaition on amount of fabs is totally right, Intel has tons of fabs in the US and outside of US, Intel is great on creating chips, US has like 4-5 FABS and across the world Intel owns like 15+ FABs all this not related to tsmc
Waiting for a response video calling this guy out on his bullshit. Just kidding.
dump china come to india.
Give it to us rrrraw and wwwwriggling. You keep nasty chips
Um how do we recycle these electronics when they get destroyed?
The way I see it, the war started during the trade war which former Pres. Trump started.  When he requested Canada to hold Huawei owner's daughter Meng Wanchou.  Then, USA started pressuring countries to stop doing business with Huawei.  He also prevented people from selling chips to Huawei.  So, China had to start making their own chips.
Most of these "wars" are nothing but dumbfounded paranoia of US and its citizens. YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO BE THE MOST POWERFUL NATION IN ALL ASPECTS! There is no semi-conductor war, all nations will strive to excel at things that will result in prosperity. Just because your nations development in one particular sector has reached to a plateau doesn't mean that there is any direct threat to you.
I hope your proud of your team for this. Phenomenal.
What a guy👏
This conversation isn't complete without talking about India's plans to crash the party with its own vision for semiconductor chips.
China have lots of other way to get it now USA is lost and USA going compromise Taiwan no more protection 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Great video!  Thanks for not being the mouthpiece of the U.S. politicians and soft on China.  We need people like you to balance the good, the bad, and the ugly war mongers.
The microchip war has been going on for ages, look into the machine made in The Netherlands which we have globally agreed to not sell to China. This is why they want to attack Taiwan, because they want this machine and we are making chips with these machines in Taiwan. China is restricted to older gen chips and cannot make new gen chips at the moment.
First video of yours I've watched. Incredible presentation. Humorous and mind blowing start to finish. I never imagined I would feel like I can understand the geopolitical importance of chips and enjoy learning about it . Excellent storytelling.  Thank you
ohio
I smell trouble for Haiti.
It's not the silicon that gives the power... it's QM ☮ Without quantum mechanics we would have no understanding of semiconductors, could not have engineered the transistor, and thus would have no microprocessors.
Cold war 2.0 finally release after decades of development and this time with a new goal. Instead of going to the moon like what NFT bros wanted, it is about AI and singularity  What a time to be alive.   Btw will you cover the new insane development of Covid in china? Sht going wild over there
Silicon is the new oil
Great sum up. I was born in Taipei so knows the importance of TSMC to the island. I would hold a different opinion thinking if China invades Taiwan, seizing control of TSMC could be a very meaningful political move. They won't just get fabs without workers. There will be some engineers there if the worst happens. As you mentioned, TSMC makes 90% of the most advanced chips. They are particularly important to military applications. The world will find a way to keep it going doesn't matter who controls it. Seizing controls of these fabs will become a huge bargaining chip when you look at the entire supply chain of semi-con. It is publicly known China doesn't stand a chance in any segment of semi-con supply chain from design, manufacturing and packing+testing. Invading Taiwan and seizing control of TSMC might just be the only impactful move they can immediately take. It might even be better if they do it sooner rather than later because TSMC is in the middle of setting up fabs in Arizona. The know-how will be spread-out sooner or later. I have families and friends in Taiwans so I sure don't want the worst to happen. I also know if China pulls the trigger the price is very very very heavy to pay as we can see what is happening in Russia+Ukraine. I have family and friends in Taiwan so surely I don't want the worst to happen but everything hangs in the mind of a single person.
(Sili-KAWN)
Great info. I now know more things than I did before watching.
From ATOM BOMB to CHIP !!!  What a shit politics
Old news that we were talking about for months, tune in to find out what happens next.
Exactly why every Nato country needs to gurantee the defence of Taiwan if they fall into Chinas the amount of power china can hold over the planet would be insane.
Mate, this content is fantastic. A college would charge a full semesters worth of tuition for this 30 minute description. Lucky to have content creators like this. Love this work and channel.
This is new. Was aware of semiconductor war but the way you explain is amazing.
Stupid America.
The clip of the factory that makes microchips looks like the backrooms
This video makes me wanna buy an expensive pc but im broke so… I guess I’ll put it in the back burner and keep using my laptop from 2015 🥲
Military don’t need that advanced chips, guy.
Buckle up chiefs
Guys, hear me out: what if we worked together… to benefit… all of us?
Typical us response just tries to stop others..
Love the way you explained this even a person from non tech background can understand this. Brilliant work man!
Interesting
So basically the US is not hiding its true color anymore that they admit there is no free market and the US will play dirty to beat any competitor such as Japan in the 80s and now it's China. We will see if US imperialism still works and if the US can crush its biggest competitor to remain number one. Johnny, stop using your imagination to say China will put a partial blockade around Taiwan so we have to defend Taiwan and freedom blah blah. You know it's all BS and self-projection if you look at what the US did on the sea to block other countries including China in the past. I only use Johnny's video to test my ability of critical thinking and I'm not the dummies below who start to applaud for how great the video is.
Biden elected is the the best solution!!! 😃🤤😃
Sounds like a bunch of nonsense I ain't buying nothing yo where's your real proof at dog
Silikin.......
Its always when the US feels threatened 🤦‍♂️
India has already initiated to set up semi conductor chip factory. Can you pls talk about that
Knowing how to run a video camera and a computer does not make you a reporter of accurate information
A month ago I wrote a uni paper about this industry (focused on AMD) and this video would have solved a lot of research time! I had no idea about how deadly important this specific problem is to the world. Lovely explanation, thank you!
Yes United States elected leaders are very stupid early 70's and 80's they moved microchip manufacturing from Arizona to Taiwan at the time a country separate from China now they moved microchip manufacturing out of Taiwan back to the United States Arizona.
Yeah that's probably where the smallest microchips are going robots military weapons satellites rocket engines nothing to do with the general public everything you showed would run on micro chips made 30 years ago
you think china didnt see that coming? I bet they already had a ton of stockpiles in their storage. globalization is not a good thing nowadays because countries use them to leverage against one another.
Just what's on the news violent clashes in Hong Kong Violent police citizen clashes in Taiwan violent authority mainland China clashes huge factories shutting down all the time because of covid 2023
Upon seeing the advertisement for your video I did a quick Google search Google says China is not competitive and not going to be competitive anytime soon
1:48 🧐who is that?
Those stealth bombs flying around with Nvidia logos on them.
war war and war... is it the nature of human to always being greedy? and scared of death? so we do everything to not die... we all forget that we will be die one day, we are not eternal...
Taiwan created the western world.
Instead creating transistors as small as DNA, can’t we just use DNA as transistors, and grow them instead…? 🤔
Your going to need that chip just to buy food one day, it’s called The mark of the beast
I like this ads better than the ones given by YouTube, If they don't really apply to you skip it, if they do stay and watch. This time, they talk directly to me! so I watched it.
Of course you shop at Trader Joe’s. Lean into it bro
You need to twist 5:23  Edit: 5:24 was too late for the joke and 5:23 is a bit too early but work with what you got   Ahh
If you think it’s just begun you have a lot more to learn catch up.
Lol i could care less. If no chips are made and i would not miss a beat
You can't see the grift ...   which is our tax dollars going to support the rich and help them get wealthy..   if you think our government is doing this for your own good, you're very naive..
US would experience a shock in the market temporarily. But US would wreck China shit if they wanted too. China as the worlds factory will over time be replaced with someone else
Silicon what does that mean?
Of course he's making merchandise out of us! So sick of this greedy generation! 😒
Took me a few days to watch this one. Didn’t think I would enjoy it but it may be the best one yet. Good job👍🏾
So microchip is the Uranium of WW2.
There you have it, they could definitely  put it in a vaccination 😱 Sad at the advancement of all this technology mostly to do with military and weapons. Not something peaceful, but all about control and destruction. Read about the hour of trial. Ancient Prophecy of a city, the hub of all trade, completely destroyed and burned with fire. This is definitely sad news, but judgment comes apon Nations that turn from God and murder innocent women and children. Tim Ballard gave a statistic that USA is the top buyer of online child pornography and the sale of human souls. They know what's coming down the pike.
So.   How come the US can’t make their own chips? You hate Reagan so bad but glos over everything.  Typical YouTuber.
Duh.
Who came here because of law of advisor
Love these videos! BTW, I think the video looks a little washed out white.  Minor complaint on an excellent video.
Absolutely Riveting!
Also a lot of nuclear analysts have stated that most of China's nuclear warheads are probably not operational
Even if China invaded Taiwan and took them over, they still don't have to know how to operate fabs. Do you think America was just going to let taiwan's most advanced engineers stay there in that country after invasion? Of course not, they would grant them Asylum and bring them here ASAP so there would be nobody left in Taiwan or China who could operate those fabs
you should play the game Factorio from steam. Its really starting to make sense...
Honestly all your videos about China are severely misinformed. They're not ahead on those missiles at all, Norma ballistic missiles are all Hyper Sonic you dummy. The only difference is that they can maneuver midair but the Chinese one they tested or not reliable enough. You cannot surpass a country by using an IP Grenadier military is a joke and the country itself will collapse within the next 20 years
0:30 silicon is not a metal 👀
What a great video.
3.44 million subscribers. You must be richer than Elon Musk. So when are you going to buy out YouTube and expose Zuckerberg for the scumbag that he is? 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆 🤣 😂   This info is all new to me. I had no idea how the system worked.  Thanks, Johnny!
Nanomachines Son! became Canon
The SpIce must flow.
Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel are probably the most important companies in the history of semiconductors and yet you left them out mostly?  Intel also has many fabs around the world and in the U.S.   Intel is the only real competitor to TSMC and just only recently fell behind in nodes to them, which they are correcting.  You need to look into what Intel is doing.  Nvidia doesn't make chips, Apple, AMD, and Nvidia get their chips form TSMC.  Intel makes its own chips but does outsource some work to TSMC.   Anyway, Intel will supply more chips (mostly from U.S. and E.U) then TSMC and you hardly talk about them.
Ahhhh
But another problem is that were globally reliant on China for our Apple products. This video sums my opinion perfectly. https://youtu.be/r0XChtIWsvY recent Chinese protests: https://youtu.be/37otC5vYirw
I don’t understand anyone who isn’t convinced to buy ASML stock hahahaha
as a mechatronics major i am geeking out at the history part and the definitions tuurgufudjdbdbfbbf
You know watching american history on the internet, it seems reagan is the worst presiden.. my knowledge is of course very limited on america history, so it might be very innacurate, so for those who know please enlighten me..
That's American greed ...they knew what they were doing and that's just the beginning.  The Chinese invasion is coming and the government is allowing it
WTF
This is all happening by design, not accident.
lol you were all complaining when trump was protectionist, now that biden is doing it you all support lmao NPCs
This content is garbage🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢
the work that goes into these videos is incredible, well done
I work in the Semiconductor industry and This is hurting companies across the United States.  America should’ve kept manufacturing State Side for something as important as Microchips.   The Tooling and tooling that is made to create these microchips are becoming more difficult to manufacture and build because of Raw Material shortages.
Highly overrated channel.  Full of theatrics, and vulgar display of weath, editing and graphics capabilities.  Unsubscribing !
Thanks for making the video. As a Taiwanese all I can say is that you indeed captured the essence of the issue we have been dealing with in the last 30 years 😂.
OK so chips are gonna be made in America. Great, get ready for really expensive tech. Luckily I'll probably be dead before the first chip rolls out of an American Fab. These facilities do not go up overnight.
Bullshit.
Countries: Chips Change the world!   Johnny: Mmmm. Doritos Chips!
America getting really  really desperate to control and contain China’s rise.  They were easily and able to control n cut down Japan, Germany n other smaller Asian countries but China is a totally different beast. These sanctions shows how desperate America has become. And as usual it won’t work in the long run. Rather it would just make China stronger as they will develop their own chips in the near future and perhaps ironically destroy America’s only advantage it has over China at the moment when China mass produces their own chips.
Thanks Johnny and team for making this known. I think the 24 hour news cycle hasn't touched this like your did.
this is the best video ever and I trust all the information given a 100% with no doubt whatsoever and knowing that this person does not work for the cia or any other government agency trying to sway public opinion one way or other and the opinion's written here are not bots at all just boosting credibility of anything said here.     wow amazing how independent research can open one's eyes 👁️
If the morons go to war over this lets just hope taiwan, silicone valley and Bejing gets wiped so we all can revert to vacuum tubes and mind out own business.
America is so dim witted....they let China manufacture damn everything now look at what happened... that move was not future proof at all.
I'm off grid anyhow,so...
I heard it takes almost 20 years to build one of these super high technology factories
Let’s not forget that China and it’s president are sending Fentanyl chemicals to Mexican cartels so that Americans get hooked and die. They don’t need to beat us with warfare. They’re killing us from the inside out. We need to stop Fentanyl.
Silicone is in you!
This is why all the lies about Uyghurs.
Gotta stay the heck away from microchips
Just don't get any microchips in your hand/wrist or forehead lol
"Now I will eat a peanut butter cip from trader joes."  What!?
Keep doing what you do. Thank you
so you really said silicon instead of chips a few times... well that could have spared me some confusion
Well really Joe Biden and the Democrats are the ones selling out the USA to China. To Joe Biden and the Democrats, everything has a price.
?????????
Whoever coined the term "bargaining chip" was surely a time traveler.
One chip to rule the world!
you missed India in this
Schwer zu sagen wer gewinnt . Aber so muss man dies nicht sehen wir haben ein ganz anderes problem.  Aber hierzu spaeter
You can't help yourself but to be a western mouthpiece and portray china as an evil state, I thought you're objective, shame on you.
Anybody know the song at 17:08
"Microships, this is why we have nice things!" Amazing video 👍
I’m surprised u didn’t pull out a picture of the Kardashians for all the silicone they use
Do ones on casino chips and how intricate they are
War china usa this is bs
It was USA who wanted a freetrade/globalization using there currency. Now someone is taking advantage of it,and now they are crying 😭😭😭😭. The hypocrisy of US
Selling our intelligence to foreign buyers should be illegal
This maybe how ww3 gonna start
the propaganda war is also happening. and this channel is prime example.
you are covering this story yet you dont understand why the semiconductors are ground breaking? and it binds your mind? how did you even get into this. Btw a ton of shit is wrong (or mostly/partially).
Without Asml there is nothing
Hi, Nick!
Am disappointed in Harris for reapeating the same words as propaganda media.  I thought he was better than a broken records who can only repeat someone else's words.   "WANT TO INVADE"   !  !  !   Please, go back to newspaper school.
American Capitalism wins again, they will sell everything
Why so many ads?
We already know the Chinese response. The CCP set up the "big fund", which was supposed to be used to create a domestic supply of chips. The problem however is that China is corrupt on a scale that is hard for us in the West to imagine. The "big fund" was essentially embezzled, creating some chips but of such low quality, they could not replace the good chips designed in America and fabricated in Taiwan. This isn't the only economic disaster on China's hands right now, hell, it isn't even the biggest disaster in China, not by a long shot.   If the CCP manages to juggle all its problems perfectly (and I do mean perfectly), it may have the opportunity to set up a second "big fund", one you bet they will not be allowed to be plundered a second time. This would be a multi-year endeavor, though, and assumes China doesn't suffer a catastrophic internal schism. So, that is the future: China breaks apart under its own weight, or manages to spend several years rebuilding itself, so it can have a second chance at domestic chip fabrication and design.
Not really a war if our enemies can’t see or drive 😂😂
This dude looks like a walking gap commercial
Do more of business and geopolitical stuff Johnny. Love it.
One of your best videos yet. Johnny, you need to do a video on the government and UAP’s. The fact they’ve admitted their real is mind blowing. I live in DC, and I’ve heard Senators and Congressmen on the Intel committees have had their minds blown by video and testimony from military and Intelligence community personnel.
no mention of ASML? still relatively obscure i guess...
I feel like it's a crime to subscribe to this channel 😂
Sup Nick!
I just want to point out China is the second most populous country in the world.
With Sleepy Joe as Resident, China will win the chip war.
And not to forget spiritual warfare
Like the fabs moving to America because I want to work at one of those fabs
Greed kills.
As someone who works in tech, I'm really wondered how much our western R&D is slowed down due to western bureaucracy. We can't keep up with China, thus instead of reducing our administrative bottleneck and improving efficiency, let's increase the amount of bureaucracy with a new set of additional rules...
Tesla, Nikola Tesla!, so no comments....
Hey Nick @1:50
This is absolutely mental
I've already forgotten the channel you used to work for, glad you kept going to become independent, there's integrity that comes from doing so and respect from me! Have you heard of a channel called asianometry? might be worth contacting him as he's done some very in depth videos about the semiconductor industry, from that UV thing you mentioned to TSMC, might get a few more videos out of this topic, or collaborate, that'd be pretty cool
China will never create a potato chip thats more tasty than an American brand. They don’t understand the cutting end ingredients that goes into a Lays for example. Their potato chip industry will never beat the us
I have no idea, or had, how important this stuff was...
I love the disclaimer at 6:44. My EE brain is happy to let the oversimplification pass.
being afraid of china is so stupid
It's ridiculous, no country will use imported chips to make weapons. The Chinese military uses low-end chips above 40nm, all of which are domestically produced.Cutting-edge chips are used to make mobile phones.
Ching Chang China 🇨🇳

all we need now is guac for this party
Does Johnny get pissed that Doug Demuro has a million more subs with kindergarten level editing?
Awesome video!
This all started the day President Nixon opened up trade with China. Good job Nixon!
16:19, While it is true that the transistor density is still increasing, they aren't really getting smaller, 7nm, 5nm, 2nm etc. are just process names, nothing in there is actually this size. Transistors are not 1-Dimensional anyways, so the size used to be the length of the Gate of the transistor but that is no longer the case.  Good video where der8auer shows electronmicroscope shots of modern transistors: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtuUANbaEFI
Just to be clear, China can make 14nm chips, and most, in not all, military equipments NEEDS to thicker transistors (their satellites use 100+nm chips). This is due to fact that they need to be reliable and nearly resistant to all electronic interferences. They can either use good shielding or less shielding with "thicker" chips. American satellites use 100+nm chips as well ( according to the chips used on the perseverance Mars rover). That why I think, chips or not, China will have hypersonic weapons. And chips will not *directly relate to military power. Taiwan produce 3nm chips, but their weapon systems are so out dated that most barely work (according to Taiwan reserve training videos). Also, since America is big and power in terms of chips, then why do you think they don't even have a working demonstration vehicle for hypersonics?😅
1:32 "nah in just playing with you, this doesn't have silicone in it"   Now I know it's not what you meant but it's got a lense i assume is made of glass, therefore it does have silicone in it
It makes more sense why my country (Lithuania) tries its best to get Taiwan's involvment to build semi-conductor factory here, especially that we have Russia at our boarder. We have good relationship with Taiwan and China is mad at us like a lot - they even put some economic sanctions (blocking all our products and raising taxes for theirs) specifically to my country. Taiwan's ambassadors are willing to invest and share their technology with us for actively supporting them and in about 5-10 years we will have a first semi-conductor factory at the geographical center of Europe. We are already starting to build it. Thanks for a great vidro Jhonny!
Actual video starts at 4:43
I wonder how China funded all this. It's almost like every nation kept doing trade with them boosting their economy. But that would be silly.
👏👏👏
interesting premise just couldnt watch it because of his hat
Would love to hear more about lithium and its role in global economics, as well as the environmental impact
Hi Nick! 👋🏻 lol
Since they can't fabricate high or medium-end chips and are totally dependent on other countries for the materials, equipment, software and expertise to build the poorest quality low-end chips. The stuff in you phones, computers, cars, etc. don't come from China. The build the chips for your smart devices or to make your microwave sing to you and with the Biden's tech embargo, that's over as well.  If China invaded Taiwan tomorrow took over the plants whole, without firing a shot, they can't run them.  They've tried getting into higher level manufacturing for years, spent a fortune and have nothing to show for it.
where do u live,.  u look like a dude from vancouver canada
could have and should have been a 10 min video
Has anyone here used Scaler?  I am in a run for my career and I am wondering if it would be good to take.
Who is he talking nonsense? Usa is a great power? Cold war?
"new conflict"... This has been going on for a while
Doritos and  now computer chips 🤣 Chips rule the world, now your channel
I like this guy, he very good at being a preak, imaginary paper treal and all.
Its contents like this what made people more confusing, advanced chips were not widely used in the military equipments as size isn’t a concern there, there are mainly used in portable consumer electronics, where China dominates, especially the mobile suppliers ie. huawei Xiaomi one+ and more, and that’s the reason why the US decided to destroy globalization and started the trade war against China and many its Allies at the first place, simply because American first and on one else stands a chance to challenge that, then the Us cut off China from the chip supply chain completely. However, lower end chips are still fine to ship to China up to this very date which actually more than capable to be used on missiles and fighter jets, but make hardly any use in  high end consumer markets.
Amazing video
Countries like India are trying to be in the game even its way behind than this gold rush.
USA making micro chips in OHIO 💀26:15
A bit disclaimer as of right now china is the biggest manufacturer of low end chip afaik as of now china is fully independent and this is the one inside your modern appliance  or even weapons frankly speaking its fairly easy to be made or reverse engineer. The one taiwan control are the high end one the one inside computers or phones.  Anyway USA is a jerk preaching about free market but absolutely hate the idea of losing and rigged the game.
Free Market Economy is possible. But not when you have a communist fella as big as China swallowing every new tech device to increasing their repression and become bigger and more threatening to the same world they're feeding of.
Electrical Engineering student here at UT Austin. Austin has now a dubbed "Silicon Hills", companies now settling in Texas. I loved this video man!
Data is the new oil..
US centric no a problem, but why US centric comes at the expense of affecting business in other countries? That’s a big problem.
So thats why us was making fabs on us territory... Feels good being able to join diferent pieces of information from diferent places and put it together
How many bots are in the comments 🧐
Dude ❌you give good Idea 💡💡💡 to china ❌❌❌ now china will block Taiwan ❌❌❌
Thankyou for clearing why it mattered
WW3 is at hand..... and people don't even realize it
They should have done this more than a decade ago.
OMG just get to the point!
I like the video, Harris, but Taiwan isn't a country. You should do a bit more research on that topic. Good video, though.
A thing I miss from this video (and many other geopolitical analysis) is an exploration of the reasons for China-America rivalry. China and America being adversaries I presented as a given, to the point that it's even worth discussing. But why are they adversaries? And why are they investing in overpowering each other in case of conflict, instead of investing in avoiding conflict all together?
We will see more and more countries trying to develop their own fabs, if possible - it's a resource like any other, if you can't at least make your own you will be reliant on someone else. Once America has multiple fully functional fabs stateside (and auxiliary ones in Canda, Mexico, Europe, India) they will forget how to spell the name Taiwan. Look at what happened with oil & gas and tell me I'm wrong. Once we gained the capabilities to scout, manufacture, stockpile our own oil/gas American culture & politics cared less about the oil trade and the Middle East in general.
It is extremely unfortunate that these fabs can only run if they have a lithography machine, of which only one comoany, ASML, produces these machines. If the US is really serious about making chips, they need to invest in building these lithography machines to be able to make the actual chips. ASML only supplies their machines to a handful of companies, I think five total.
Watching this while eating fish and chips
I feel so safe with Joe Biden as president! He's just the greatest and I feel confident that he and his caretakers, i mean handlers, i mean owners, i i i mean associates, will protect us from danger and war!
Add Rare Earth Minerals to the list
All I know is this channel is starting to get really chippy.
Killed this vid Johnny
My favorite Hipster
For people who want to understand more on this, go check out Asianometry
Nvidia is not a chipmaker. TSMC is. Stop calling those companies chipmakers, they just design them. And please be more objective about the US in general, we expect you to be. People all over the world watch your content and you shouldn't really be on the US' side all the time and dodge stuff that would paint US in a bad way.
Thank you for Being YOU. The show feels ethical, factual, and informative without being pretentious.  if I could invest...I would. :)
Please start the podcast........... That will be more informative.
You quickly overlooked the Netherlands there, which has ASML - the company that crates machines for all the FABs.  It is the only company of its kind and has zero competition. Without it none of the FABs could exist.  Yes, really.
Thank you for this video and also for sharing your sources! I was just about to start writing a paper on this subject, so I'm really happy I came across this video
Dictators are and will always remain a problem.
24:25🤣🤣
I LOVEEE YOUR VIDEOSS ❤❤❤❤
GO CHINA
Taiwan isn't actually apart of china. that's fake news. and um its under protection of the untied states and all our chips other than intel come from tsmc
Can you do one on the WEF (World Economic forum), please?
Taiwan recently invested into a few Lithuanian companies one of which is going to build a factory to produce semiconductors. This was big news in Lithuania as it's going to accelerate our economic growth and it's also a geopolitical move because Lithuania acknowledges Taiwan as a free country and China hates us for it :v
hey nick
We dont need any of that shit with chips in it... except maybe a refrigerator and theres refrigerators without chips
Mmmmm, Chips.... Oh wait. Not those kinda chips?
Great job with the video Johnny, awesome to see your storytelling and journalism evolve over the years of watching you
the big questions is who owns silicon ? CONGO ......THAT IS WHY THE WAR .......FINALY AFRICAN WILL  UNITE ...
Uhh... as a Taiwanese... Johnny made it sound like the situation is such a planned event from the Taiwanese government.  But the truth is (almost always) somewhere in the middle.  Honestly it's half planned, and half by accident that Taiwan got this "silicon shield", which the name is not even a thing until like 2021/22ish. It's also a really lucky half accident that TSMC didn't move to China, when in the late 90s to early 2000s Taiwan lost a lot of manufacturing to China.  The story goes that the other major fab MediaTek (under UMC) made the move to go to China, but the Taiwanese president at the time was able to convinced TSMC to wait first and see what happened.  Now 20 years later, the ex-president of UMC publicly expressing regrets moving to China, and TSMC becomes the head of the industry in Taiwan. There is also a whole saga of how China wasted billions of dollar trying to catch up and in the process poached quite a bit of high lvl management/engineers from TSMC/Taiwan, and all that effort down the drain... but that's a story for another day
❤👍good job, i love this video, a new Cold War is begun
Can't tell if that's a Dorito on his shirt or a piece of technology. Either way, seems like he has a chip on his shoulder.
for the last 20 years . US try to contain China .  China cannot be stopped . in 2030 China will crush the US .
Great video! (from a fellow history teacher point of view). Some additional relevant news: the USA is currently pressuring the Dutch government to restrict the crucial Dutch company ASML to supply any high tech "magic laser machine" parts to China. ASML CEOs in the Netherlands do not want to restrict further supply and business to China currently though. The major question now: is this going to change after president Biden had a meeting three days ago with the president of the Netherlands (Mark Rutte) in the White House?
I love how easy these are to digest. Makes it easy for a lazy ass such as myself.
How do you not have more subs. 3.4M is WAY TOO little. Keep up the amazing work man
I can't wait to see Skynet make their move on the U.S.A and China... oh, wait!
Great video but no one makes microchips without ASML a Dutch lithography company. Secondly what China does really well is recycle older computer parts, where the rest of the world just dumps their e-waiste look At a company like huanzhi for example recycling and making new x99 motherboards... And reselling them this has been going on for a few years. Old server parts still make good PC parts. There is a bigger agenda
YES!!! PODCAST!!! Talk about any damn thing you want!
Prime minister of Taiwan??? Are you serious!?
Why are you wearing a hat? Is it cold in your office?
So Trump was right all along
I think you are forgetting that blocade is in fact an act of war
You'd think China would invade before the TSMC plant in AZ is finished. Not sure how Taiwan trusts the U.S. enough to outsource their manufacturing to Arizona...  It's clear the higher-ups from Taiwan's government and chip industry have been given U.S. citizenship in the case of invasion.
Could you imagine if Europe & the UK stopped the US having access to their technology? It would literally go medieval overnight.
Sorry but absolutely laughed my ass off when you said that America was afraid of the Chinese military.....America would absolutely CRUSH China.......... period.  China is weak and full of projection . Every single thing they have is a CHEAP knock off of an American product. If you think that is something to fear than you need to get your head checked.
how do you research and read up on such important issues and explain them so well, even though you are dyslexic?
Great video Johnny
Do a follow up please and more economics pls
I didn't know ARM was American...
Why is it a 'threat' if another country makes a weapon you don't have. Does no one see that this is the root cause of EVERY problem? When will greed and hatred end? :(
spendy
Johnny. Thank you
next  CHATGPT
Love your videos. Many information and well known personality.
This does kind of miss the massive corporate espionage problem that companies kept assuring the government wasn't real until we found out it was even worse than that. Which is a big reason the government took these emergency measures.
Me when johnny isn't bias: impossible 😱
Like always amazing presentation ❤️ thank you
Poof! And suddenly my video card costs 1200 bucks
Innovation comes from individuals not governments
Well done piece man 🤜🏼🤛🏼
Live Taiwanese reaction:
dont feel bad for nvidia, they are not the good guys
I'm glad Johnny talked about silicin instead of silicon.
I've started seeing you videos and ways of thinking have changed about geopolitics. Some people suggested about you. A BIG 👍
What a video! Johnny is one of the best at what he does 👍💯
B.o.b said this silent war🎉
Biden is the puppet of the deep state. Try to change my mind...
So that's why fujifilm products aren't available for me to purchase easily in U.S protectorates
China is good stealing, and copying things that’s for sure. My family runs a business selling designs for signs and shirts and stuff on Amazon and we are constantly battling sellers from China stealing exact copies of our designs or copies that are so close it might as well be exact. Five or six years ago there weren’t any and now there are almost entirely all Chinese sellers doing this, so China is good at stealing stuff instead of doing it their selves.  Plus I highly highly doubt china beat us to hypersonic missiles. We just don’t yell it from the rooftops when we have it. open your eyes there is no way China is ahead of us militarily on anything when we spend more on military in the top next nine (approx) countries combined
I've always wondered how China even got nukes in the first place... did they get the tech from us after WWII or did they develop them on their own before we cared enough to stop them?
Hi Nick
Could you shoot in 24fps? This felt like it was shot at 30fps and above and was really jarring.
Joe Biden isn't afraid of the Chinese military - he's been getting paid by the Chinese Communist Party for decades. Joe Biden isn't qualified to make decisions regarding our national security, most presidents aren't, those decisions are made by people that are not elected. Most importantly, Joe Biden isn't coherent enough at this point to gracefully walk off a stage much less understand anything as it relates modern technology or National Security. He's a puppet, a mouth piece, and soon-to-be fall guy for the people that are really in charge.
Make a video on how the British changed the original names of different places and countries.
So us is leaving Taiwan  slowly. That is all I see. Too much tension.
China no more most populous country 🤣.
The waffle house has found its new host
i liked the back of the mind camera :)
Seems the same old story, we give them weapons so one day there will be an easy excuse to wage war. The fact that they say that china is technologically ahead of usa, take two birds with one stone. If you really search, you will see that china is not that advanced, the infrastructures they build are bad and crumbly. They may be advanced in the mass surveillance systems, but the rest doesn't cope with what they are saying about the military industry. How come, many of their new cities are so badly designed and constructed? But in the military they make wonders?? and i don't want to talk about their space program, just have a comparative look in what USA, EU, RUSSIA, and few others had produced, just the imaging  stuff (pictures and videos), you will see it for yourself.
This is awesome, Johnny, one of the best docs i have seen about the topic. Keep it up !
You should do a video on all of the international companies that pulled out of Russia at the on set of the Conflict. Reports are coming out that only a small percentage of companies actually left.
This Ronald Reagan, "theme" as you call it to protect American chips was a theme that should have continued. There are certain things that our country should never outsource to other countries. One of them being our technology - especially as it relates to our National Defense. Just take for example the chip shortage we had with the automotive industry as of late. If they were produced in this country, we wouldn't be dependent on other countries, and often our enemies, to supply them to us. Not to mention the endless possibilities of our enemies corrupting those very systems and spying on us because they control the manufacturing and supply. I wouldn't fault Ragan for that. Free market is essential for a prospering economy, yet so is national security.
Talk about a kick in the face smh these are cold war tactics from the us but for some reason you don't hear about Russia trying to get chips wondering why not.....good question
this video was amazing and being able to see all that is happening is insane. i would love to see you make a video about the Beirut port explosion in Lebanon and how that occurred, since there is many speculation about what truly happened on august 4th 2020 in the midst of a huge economical collapse.
Taiwan is not a country
All this talk of chips is making me hungry....Fries anyone?
19:51 China just stole some of South Korea's semiconductor technology recently. It's all over the news. It's an intellectual crime which is despicable. I hope they stop doing that. They did the same last time with folding screen technology as well. They just steal the hardwork of research that costs billions of dollars worth of investment by bribing people from other companies and countries!
24:18 This is highly misleading. As you kind of mentioned the US can't actually manufacture these chips without TSMC or Samsung, and they can't manufacture the chips without a whole range of expensive equipment from all over the world. The US has not only stopped export of US-made stuff to China, it has essentially forbidden everyone else from selling this equipment to Chinese companies as well. So they aren't just 'blocking' the lines from the US to China, they are 'blocking' lines coming from all over the world to China. Additionally, consider that these other companies from other countries produce the same chips for the US military. So essentially its cool when other countries help advance the US military but it is not ok if they help China as well.  This whole thing is literally just the US abusing its hegemonic powers to try and delay China from becoming a super power that can directly rival the US. And everyone else is playing ball because they currently exist in this hegemonic system and can't afford to go against the US.
Really... It's been going on for a few years...  But this is odd because goods and even services are being exchanged between the countries at "war"...
Is it only me or xi jinping looks like madam gao?
I'll always be amazed at how willing the US is to advance China technologically to a position of being a real threat. The height of stupidity in my opinion, and totally unnecessary.
16:15 That is not accurate, modern process nodes like IBMs 2nm do not actually give you any physical length. This used to be the case down to roughly 28nm, where the number gives you the gate-width of a transistor. More modern process nodes do not necessarily scale by making the gate all that much narrower, instead they scale by decreasing the distance between transistors, their height etc. Basically they just use other means of scalling but still use the old gate-width naming scheme so it is easier to roughly understand how dense and energy efficient a given process is.  The IBM 2nm process actually has a gate-width of roughly 12nm, so the virus is actually a very appropriate size comparison.
china is going to collapse in 30 days
great explanation Johnny! 👍 we would also love to hear more about Nickel and how they would impact the world in the future (since were talking about the future currency of the world now; chips, energy, etc)
Morris Chang was from China not Taiwan. Lol
I want to eat 2nm chip
Hey propoganda machine of west, fix your map Ladakh is sovereign territory of republic of India
aaah this is about that silicon. Not that other silicons. ho capito...
Hsinchu science park!😊
Dayum, those pingels are nice.
Wow
Can US trust China ? , its the biggest question going forward , as China is trying to deceive US and world by showing that they are having change of heart , and they are friendly country . Can US and world trust that ? China will backstab if they get chance !! China played its card too early and now trying to buy time so that they can earn time to become global leader .
great video, well done!
The supply chain is absolutely complex for semi conductors. If you liked this video look up Asianometry on YouTube. That channel dives into the tech where the manufacturers of the machines that make all the chips. Look up the Dutch company ASML. They also have mfg in the US. TSMC just invested a couple billion for a chip fab in Arizona
As always US did, when they felt threaten, Blocked.
Arguably the first step in the US-China tech war was when the US banned Huawei.
hey i wanna ask where india stands in all semi conductor war and can you make a detailed video about india''s future  plan to be a siginifcant power in world are or its just a small growth period of one random country
6:41 "Binary System & Mystic - Zero Or One [HQ Edit]"
Lol, so much emphasis on "AmErIcAn ChIP". China is employing strategies which America did 50 years ago, after WW2.  America controls the supply chain of tech but that is changing, which is worrisome for a declining super power.
So, in short, everything is about money. Richer countries don't want the poor ones to keep boosting their economy to improve people's life quality, so they must ensure their military power is way ahead in order to force the others to obey....In the meanwhile they keep spreading their values which is peace and love, sharing is caring, human rights and freedom.....Alright, that's how Human Civilization works...
Tsmc is also opening a massive plant in texas that will produce theyre second best chip but could produce the best one they offer if say there was a war in taiwan.
The U.S-led West terribly fears competition from the Socialist led Societies. What a coward!
Any Chinese here watching this huge stereotyping dude doesn't know single F of the Chinese history yet still enjoying his ignorant AF "knowledge" and tech stuff speech? Guess we are getting pretty used to it. Yea, just another westerner.
Hey greetings from Germany, we dumb an ignored all of that.  Even tho we probably could have buid the best machinery for it.
Who is the editor? Nice environment
What I Can say is, the technology will slow down and not as fast as the last 10 years. The World is splitting up. Yes there are good and bad side. why don't you see it from another perspective.
As my Bioinformatics professor once told me, be careful about describing computer things as being like brains.  Neurologists will dropkick you.
Very Typical US type of perspective, when you said using US microchip technology to build the technology. Why don't you said you use all old scientist theory to build the tech.
The issue is that we allowed countries that don't share our democratic values to join a system that they exploited and we were the fools that let it happen. Globalization can work but only with like-minded countries that want to share in the prosperity it brings.
No I'm thinking with all the different types of chips on the market there will be more new flavours that will place the packet of power that will crinkle the enemy  no doubt salt will be rubbed into the wounds  and many will crumble  but it's time for the big crunch .. this is my version of a sarcastic pun now let's here apt chats awnser  I'll post it separately  look for it
a ton people have it in there body pacemakers hearing aids and more
US just love easy job, the hard jobs throwing to other, when someone is more successful than him, US just crush it.
US just jealous on other countries that can make chip faster than him. Start to crush every country that is more successful than him.
Lays makes the best chips !!
I'm so glad we're finally taking China as a serious threat. This has been going on so long; they do not help any other country and don't follow agreements.
What im seeing is that we are going to pay a lot more for our tech than now.
The CCP is actually a subsidiary of Soviet Union. It is easy to tell just by looking at its flags. Soviet flags, The Hammer and Sickle; The Red and Gold; The Red Banner are flying all over the PRC for more than 73 years.   The five golden stars on the red flag of PRC are identical to the Hero of Soviet Union. The title Hero of the Soviet Union (Russian: Герой Советского Союза) was the highest distinction in the Soviet Union, awarded together with the Order of Lenin personally or collectively for heroic feats in service to the Soviet state and society.  Hope it is not too late to wake up…
My favourite chips are Doritos Sweet Chili Heat
need chips now
The word computer was originally used to describe women who did tedious scientific calculations. Both the word computer and calculator describe female mathematicians
Taiwan....
India is most populated country not china
Where Doritos for "food" chips reference?  Oh yeah, the taste elixir
Building fabs in Ohio doesn’t sound like a good idea 😂
Huh , though it was those greedy companies approached first
They make an advancement in technology, the US replies by blocking them and trying to stop humanity advancements. What a joke of a country
I dont think this is a  new thing,there is food war , clothes war ,metals war ,oil war ,gas war , electricity war etc.
Building fabs in Ohio might make my computer be on crack
Its such a regular thing in recent history that anything bad happening has a ~30% chance to be causeg by reagan or thatcher
Where is Russia in all of this, do they rely on there own tech. Or the US government ain't afraid of Russia, or are they allies😅.?
Even with billion people what chinese people lack is creativity. They are notorious for stealing others ideas and copying them. China is like that poisonous spider in your shoe. They are playing the long game by sending chinese to study in US and work for us companies some even defense contractors. They are here to steal and US doesnt do anything against it. They are even brainwashing the youth with tiktok in the US and collecting data. China killed millions with the virus they created because they eat everything in sight and when the world finally healed they are preparing for war. China is truly the parasite of this world that consumes and destroys everything in its sight.
Definitely blocking this trashtuber
Nice
Great video, appreciate the real talk💯💯💯
This block is stupid. It's of a 1980s mentality. Anyone in charge of national security should assume that all countries have complete access to extreme technology in a few years. This is the equivalent of emptying a sinking ship with a glass instead of isolating the compartments that are leaking
Hey Nick
Only US is exploiting others using military and washing brain using its media.
Forgot to mention Taiwan investment in Europe (Lithuania). They just signed on semiconductor deal. All because Lithuania gave a middle finger to china and acknowledged Taiwan as democratic country (with its own embassy of Taiwan) and not part of China. (while most of the world is afraid of choosing side and swing both sides).
Why does the video seem to be lacking colour?
In UK, they call them crisps
In the future ...I would rather be eating Peking duck and  Mongolian Beef  ...than chlorinated chicken and hormone beef patties!
Shameless gear dump. Gear nerds unite!
The visible makes the invisible, then the invisible controls the visible, who wins?  Looks like MoneyBob is the real dealer, SpongeBob never gets it eventhough he has a long nose 🤥
USA is a wreck.
Everyone needs to read Chip War by Chris Miller
Do you know how much you try demonising China? Aren't you the guy who said about Planting a Seed in the Iraq war video ? Congratulations, you planted one. Let's Just take X & Y instead of the US and China. X pioneered a business and Y understood the basics and he understood it so well where X thinks he can do a much better job than X did.  But since X does not want it to happen (as it doesn't serve the best interest of X). The only way you can stop Y from winning this game is by stopping Y to know any further. You will stop Y until X knows what Y knows to  remain a leader. Doesn't it look obvious?  In other words, the US does not want China. to be a contestant, because the US fears that China may win this game; hence you do not want China to Outsmart the US. You guys never know the true meaning of  competition, Do you?
Don’t think America can win this war. They just stolen the semi conductor factory from our little island
I am equally : - Wow  - BS   I see,  That's the politics of current world !
I’ve know about this war since it started but you did great with the details, especially for people you have no knowledge of this!. Indeed chip rules our world!!.
😇🌹🌹
Next on list is lithium, cobalt and rare earth metals. It’s high time that governments/ researchers look at alternatives like hydrogen and hybrid systems rather than pure electric revolution. If not they have to be tight lipped about Chinese policies as 80% of world’s lithium and rare earth metals are controlled by china.
28:04 "Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan?" Joe Biden "Yes, that's a commitment we made." Damn, I felt the weight of those words...
Now I want a video of johnny harris saying chips are the future, chips are power, then the video are just ads of potato chips
China needs to get more advance chips from Taiwan to grow their army in order to invade Taiwan.  What an asshole.....LOL
Is silicon a metal?
economic interdependence between democracies is good but its not the same with communist/dictatorship-type governments. Comrades see it as an opportunity to subdue others and rule them.
you really are a CIA op arent ya
You glorify wars
Gets me excited for a really strong solar flare
Hey Nick
Americans leaders talking about the most advanced technology yet millions of their people sleepin on the street
Boo hoo a Nvidia lost business after being super greedy to general consumers. Heck’em.
Just an input. It probably just me, but the shot between 1:10 to 1:40 gives me motion sickness because of the extremely shaky camera, sudden change of lighting, and sudden jump cuts. I understand you want to make it engaging and also making a point that a lot of object has silicon, but this is probably not one of the greatest shot you made.
Don’t be mistaken, it’s got nothing to do with ideology and everything to do with who dominates the world.
thanks Johnny Harris for this great documentary
When someone goes ahead of US and A USA ego hearts
India is currently the most populace country.
There's no such thing as a Chinese private company. All are arms of the CCP.
You guys from US does not need to fear. Who start the wars are US and other capitalist countries. Hope China surpasses US soon. Because let's be fair,  US is the danger to humanity.   Other than that and a bunch of fact errors, good video, despite it is clear a anti-China propaganda.
if anyone were to allow americans to live = how will that affect the world = calculate lives lost if america survives  Do the same for china  Both can fight, i will not allow any of those sides to win
Great post. It's even more complicated. China is facing demographic and economic collapse.  I highly recommend Peter Zeihans briefings, but especially his latest book.  Easily one of the most important analysts out there. Keep up the great work!
Very informative Johny and my request to you is to make a video on effects of "De-Globalisation" what we are experiencing at present ,gradually
Time to buy TSMC Stock?
China’s military is like that annoying little cousin that got a cheap drone for Christmas.
Oh yes I have seen it coming for years.  My opinion is it will be China and Russia against USA.
Great, tanks
I love eating chips, but this video is in another level of quality.
Start a podcast!
This is what happens when you don't let the nerds run the show.
I HEARD THAT THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO PUT CHIPS IN EVERYONE.    I HOPE I GET DORITOS.
THERE ARE 10 KINDS OF PEOPLE, THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND BINARY NUMBERS AND THOSE WHO DON'T.
China take Taiwan microchips and go against them with Taiwan's microchips. It like a heroes supporting their enemy to attack the same heroes who gave supplies to the enemy
God thank Obama and his successor  Biden for the mess the United States is in. We are all just part of God's "Plan"!!
this is mind blowing, always love your video and also your music background!
Say chips one more time…
Oil & gas is far from over. Norway earned an ungodly amount of money after Russia closed access. And its pretty clear that Russia wants to sabotage Norways delivery network
Scalar is big shit in india looting money from fake ads.and now youare also getting money from them ...blocking you bro
This is such classic USA. Apparently we cant realize that our biggest enemies will be the ones feed off of us 😂
Is it possible to make a video without "China bad" here and there? :)
If that's true why is he and hunter doing making back ally deals
So Lenovos won’t be able to have Nvidia cards anymore? 🤯
The best weapon China has against the US is the US’s insatiable corporate greed…
Silicon is a metalloid and that "first transistor" is actually a tube. Not a transistor. It's the transistor that replaced the tube.
Hi Nick.
Where did you get that map behind you on the wall?
26:08 i don’t know why i laughed at this, my humor is broken 😭
Video Starts at 12:34
25:16 FUCK Nvidia. Their profits are not worth more than American lives, more of which would be lost if OUR ADVERSARY has better tech should this cold war go hot.
I prefer lays
Make a video on Matrix !
So In the end your saying things are going globalism vs nationalism and I can definitely see this…
Geopolitics is more fucking interesting than anything......
In Taiwan we literally call TSMC, the Guardian Mountain of Our Nation. Anyways, I can't believe I actually live here.
6:42 really… 😅
It’s sad to see that we humans fight over everything
Finally Johnny talking about something I'm intimately familiar with! One thing to mention is that TSMC is building fabs in the US to help diversify. But as you might guess, building a fab is absurdly expensive, and takes a long time. Their Arizona fab alone is expected to cost $12B. Another thing to mention is that a large number of chips on older process nodes are already manufactured in the US (by Texas Instruments for example), and these are all the little "glue logic" chips that are around the fancy chips. These nodes have seen reductions in capacity as fabs have moved onto the newer (and higher profit margin) nodes which was a contributing factor in the current chip shortage.   By the way, I love you calling what ASML does "Magic Laser Machines". Can confirm that is an accurate statement :D
You picture China's porposes to grow milltary, igoring the facts that their companies are building very advanced technologies in chips and developing it in a faster speed than the US companeis. For example ,Huawei has the most advanced chip design in the world whcih is the reason why the US ban it for "national secruity". Its not just millitary, is about economy secruity.
Best. Video. Yet!
I ought to trust this guy from now on!  Thanks, Johnny Harris!
You forgot to mention Ukraine and how most the world’s neon is mined there. Neon is needed to operate the lasers that create all chips.
If the United States Govt gave Taiwan more then half of the money, to originally build these facilities. Being yet another thing that could have just been done in the U.S. in the first place, an when you say it "costs billions every year" to upgrade and maintain these F.A.B.S.. Even so, these companies bring in billions every year in earnings, an profit.   An the other thing is, "the Government and the Military" may need and want technology to continually get smaller and smaller. But we really don't NEED bullcrap electronics, cpu's, etc. To get any smaller then stuff is, it's basically irrelevant at this point. But since Governments purpose is to push technology to a point in which it destroys and controls every aspect of the world, they can't help but continue advancing.   An seems to be a pattern with this Administration, in making huge landscape changing moves and decisions before anything needed to deal with those changes is in place. Which time and time again, seem to have crippling effects economically. Any country should always produce whatever THEY are capable of producing. Any imports should not be a vital necessity or anything infrastructure or economy becomes "dependant on."
Fun fact, this man sleeps in a winter hat!
at 30 min you said putin is cutting off gas to Europe? No, he is not. the EU is the one sanctioning Russia. You got it the wrong way around
Already got one. Don’t know when they put it in.
the waffle house has found its new host
Set aside trade rules, create more conflicts, spread hate, scrap globalisation, zero sum
It's Cold War 2.0.
TSMC has a plan in place to literally DESTROY EVERTYTHING if Taiwan is invaded. They LITERALLY have a scorched earth policy to prevent China from getting their fab, their information, their designs, EVERYTHING.
Morris Chang, one of the most important people to ever live and thats the best photo they could get? it looks like some black and white obituary photo in the 80s lol
Mores's law has come to an end in silicon.. do this war will be short.. The Chinese have got to 5nm in the lad, 14 in the fab and are going to build the machines in a few years that probably are going to be as good as AMSL.. and AMSL wants to sell machines while they can.. so they will.  Russia is satisfied with 14nm and say the that 28nm is needed for anything military, so they are there where they want to be.. so we wait for the 'event', something like a Carrington Event to see if all those sub 7nm chips can survive.. Some they they won't..  If not the massive voltage spike of the incoming 'electron from the CME, the plasma bombardment still may be the crux that kills this 'too small' fab....
The weirdest thing, we send China BILLIONS per year as "a developing nation" like they are a third-world nation struggling to feed itself- while it uses OUR money, OUR tech, and has a space program and one of the most advanced military EVER seen on Earth.
Stupid hat ¡¡¡¡¡
NA....
Meanwhile Russia can't even win a war agianst Ukraine
Literally 2nd Cold War
Johnny Harris trying to explain microarchitecture and logic gates is hilarious.
And Republicans voted against the CHIPS Act. Talk about patriotism..
23:10 Bro can talk 💀
Rare Biden W.
Wow! I didn't now fap was that important to national security!!!
So, what you are saying is what ever country who wants to rule the world needs all that and bag of chips, right?
Too bad dentistry hasn't made such advances.
Long live the west ❤
Okay people are we REALLY going to skip over the material that actually makes this possible. Its called Graphene. Silicon is just used to keep it in place.
This is awesome!
Bro I've got a M2 macbook and I'm think of how many many things are on it
Great info but I find you annoying, dislike.
Nvidia having a monopoly on the gpu market makes up for China x100
Hey YouTube, I’ve removed the same three times already and I’m getting tired of trying to remove it and get it off of my history please
Great video as always! Though one thing is still not very clear to me: why does it matter so much for applications like ballistic missiles and military aircraft if the transistor is the size of a virus vs the size of a DNA strand for example? I could see why that would be impactful for a smartphone and other smaller devices but I would imagine there are diminishing returns in most larger objects in having the chips so exponentially smaller. Isn’t there a point where the cost of producing ever smaller chips is no longer worth tue benefits? I mean how much actual total space/weight would a “virus size” transistor chip take up in a huge missile or airplane, compared to the “DNA sized” chip that the advantages in computing power per square inch is worth the billions of dollars of investment?
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN BRING TECH TO DETROIT.. THE HEART OF AMERICAN HISTORY... 🏪❤️
I didn't watch the whole video, but did he mention my local semiconductor company, Texas Instruments?
wait silicon valley doesnt mean that theres alot of people with plastic surgery that live there?
I fwu real heavy Johnny, but wearing beanies and never washing your hair is crazy my friend I know you itching 😂
Free markets for me, not for thee.
Hi, I’ve tried to contact YouTube about putting calamity Halloween videos on my channel but they ignore me completely and they put them on there anyway I don’t appreciate this at all. I hope YouTube reads my comment and I hope they quit doing this. I don’t like this kind of stuff I never have and I never will. This world is bad enough as it is I don’t need to hear bad news, I need to hear good news once in a while this is getting to where it’s a bunch of bullshit it needs to stop I’m sick of hearing all the bad news all the time get it off my TV cause I hate this shit and that goes for kids videos to, and a few other things I am directing this to YouTube not to anybody else. I hope they read this.😖😖😖😖💩💩 they say they respect my wishes when I delete a video but I don’t think they do because they turn right around and they put it right back on again I’m sick of it👎👎👎💩😖
Hhmmm  TSMC building in AZ  I know individuals who work in their FABS and in Intel FABS  China will easily catch up by stealing Technology.... they steal everything.
that is... not great
Another Scary thought is the semiconductors are being used by the Chinese Communist Party to spy and collect AI data on its on citizens including and not limited its own people but also to the Uyghurs they effectively have under a giant surveillance prison. The more advanced these chips get, the power power and centralization of the Chinese communist party domestically as well.
It’s always interesting seeing videos from you on topics I’m fairly aware of. I think you covered a lot of good information. It’s good to have people know about it.
Enjoy the show.  These is only a dream
my dog is silicon
I'm surprised Youtube didn't commend this video to me.
Now, you made me wonder John, the shift towards environmentalism bring us an unexpected consequences: protectionism.
This is what happens when you let the kids (corporations) run the candy store Big Daddy Government 🤨  Destroy the county, destroy the world, who cares as long as line go up 📈💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰
Another great video
There's a deep fixation Johnny has with chips and I think the Doritos episode was just a gateway for a deep dive into this topic.
We should’ve been more self-sufficient ourselves, rather than relying on other countries to help us. I’ve heard all about this I say we make our own chips or get them from somewhere else, but it don’t always work that way because the United States messes up and relies on foreign policy, take care of our own selves. Don’t rely on other countries and shit like this don’t happen we’re just plain stupid sometimes especially with a stupid president.👎👎😖😖💩💩 and you can believe this one day this shits really going to hit the fan💩💩💩😖
Amazing video!!!
Nice..
China Confront The USA
8:43 BAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHA
Youtube : Here's your Daily dose of government propaganda .
Lol I too give myself a pat on the back for a job well done expect mine is literal
Need cheap stuff ? Go to China .....ohh wait!! They are competing with us coz they are rich now.   Lets make the chips here and we will block all the resources to them. West let them win, now they are awake and finding out China is too strong to beat
CIA johnny strikes again
Johnny giving china some ideas!
Already watched this video a week ago :) nebula W
Honestly what reason does China have to continue to not be allied with the us, all they would have to do is like not be dicks to their citizens
I'm surprised you didn't reach for a bag of chips... or Doritos🤣  awesome video BTW
It's the US basically not wanting their technology to go to China. It's one sided conflict. Don't blame china
Anyone else thinking about how he has to put all that stuff he piled up to show us all the tech with chips back?
Watching this while sitting at my job at a semiconductor manufacturer
What American politicians don’t mention is Chinese origin students dominate engineering classes in America, and they also are leaders of this industries in America.
you are smashing it sir! Keep up the great work. Your stories and research is always BS free, well put together and easy for anyone to understand. I appreciate it.
You really didn't hit the point that china STEALS information and they have an entire Bureau dedicated to stealing technology. The have ruined companies because of this. Into the multiple trillions of dollars of intellectual property have been reverse engineered by the Chinese.. They are horrible people as a whole, horrible people as a system. China sucks ass and its not racism, its how they live and how they are. They hate everyone else, they scream the N word to basketball players in their country. China WAS cool from when my friend lived there but it turned to butt super quick.
Very informative video.  Thanks!
Naval and air blockade (even partially) is an act of aggressive war, and the longer the blockade is on, the greater the chance of an ultimatum (from Taiwan, or the US or jointly). It seems now  the CCP is momentarily distracted with Covid again. Later this year they might try your suggested blockade tactic against Taiwan more comprehensively. A possible resulting world war against it would be very bad for China. Geopolitically, it is far worse off than many countries in this respect. China is easy to blockade for raw energy and most of it's food. Unlike Russia, it doesn't even have as many nukes as the United States.
from 'blocked Japan to blocked China' with love - U.S (don't get ahead of yourself China we are still number one and we will always be)
10:09 Johnny talks about dust and I see one on the wafer😂😂
China will whop those woke feminists ass
To quote a man smarter than I'll ever be, "teaching sand to think was a mistake".
Carbon is life Silicon is memory
Mind blowing
I live about a mile from the tsmc fab under construction but I didn’t know this is actually the reason why. I thought they were just doing normal expansion
wow this is so badly simplified.
So conclusion is Taiwan is safe without its chips factories?
So this video is white washing & rationalizing what USA is doing.
I think this specific episode is better at 1.5x😂
Solution: Its time for a consumer quantum computers!
Fascinating. My favorite video of yours so far!
Hi Nick! 1:50
If china invades I wonder if Taiwan has something set up where all the chip fabs self destruct and blow up. That’s what I’d be telling china. Say you step foot on Taiwan we are hitting the button. lol
Jesus loves you still John. H has not forgotten you. Love from Norway
This was a great episode! I caught it a few days ago on Nebula but there is no comment section there so I'm here to read comments. I did want to add that given the US and west sanctioned Russia with full force, a partial blockade of Taiwan by China will likely now be met with strong sanctions against China. In addition, the US and Japan and maybe others would have a navy also patrolling Taiwan's water so the partial blockade would be ineffective -- or else China will have to shoot at US and Japanese naval ships. But they don't want war with them.
1:45 my dude is freaking out here, yes it's as important to us as metals at the start of the metal smithing age . 6:50 partial disagree, the signals are purely deterministic (at this stage)
Down with China!!!
Maybe it's because I just finished reading "Dune", but the chips really look like spice melange
Fun fact.  Morris Chang was born in Ningbo, Zhejiang province in the mainland china.
As a Taiwanese, I have to point out one fact , Taiwan didn’t plan to use the semiconductor industry as a shield back to the 80th , it is a beautiful mistake
Is Johnny's next video going to be about poker to complete the Chip Trilogy?
It's a brave new world.
Only in Ohio
Wow, I'm in awe of this video. You didn't mention Donald Trump once. That guy who was warning America about Chinese spies stealing US tech? Who slapped tariffs and sanctions on China? The guy who wanted to repatriate US jobs from the Far East and was widely mocked for suggesting this? I have to hand it to you Johnny, bravo
Excellent video! Well done! So companies such as Nvidia are responsible for selling out US technology to foreign adversaries...why does it matter how much money they lost when the ban took effect
Taiwan is part of China Jonny.
Russia never cut oil off from EU! Russia wants to make money. It’s the EU that stopped buying gas from Russia.   This guy needs to do his research rather than spewing propaganda.
In the 80s, the US crashed the Japanese semiconductor industry, devalue their currency, and the US population increasingly showing hate toward the Japanese population. Fast forward to today, we are seeing the something playing out again, but this time the country in the US's crosshair is called China. I think this have nothing to do with US vs China, it's more like the US vs the world, if not China or Japan, there will always be another.
They’re running our world but they shouldn’t we made it way too damn complicated it’s all gonna come to an end we keep this up
I didn’t vote for the Biden administration and honestly thought very little of what has been done so far by them however good move cutting china off and defending Taiwan.
Just like when the Nazi's took silver from everyone, America is gonna start rounding up chips
Johnny, you might want to consider doing a similar study on the Lithium-Ion battery supply chain if you want to see how China might react to a full blown conflict over Taiwan.  "Rare Earth" metals really are the "New Oil" IMO and China has that market cornered.  If they feel the pressure of a chip shortage, they might well respond by placing a targeted embargo on batteries and the materials required to make them.
As an engineer at Micron. No one cares.
And congress members and their families made hundreds of millions buying stocks they were going to fund.
The USA is a day late and, now with the debt celling, a dollar short! Maybe in another life time. 👻
Thank you for that movie :)
Lmao we have ufos..
How will the giant new TSMC plant here in Phoenix (about 10 miles from my house) figure into everything? Will it mean less security for Taiwan itself if they have a plant here now?
wow super educational, I had no idea how this system works. Thanks
For your podcast you could just put your episodes on Spotify …I like to listen to your episodes as I relax at the end of the day 👍
The price of chips will become more expensive in the future. Thanks America.
Australia leads the fight on China! AUKUS!
One other interesting to note that should also be mentioned is that Russia and Ukraine are two of the largest producers of neon and palladium keys materials used to create semiconductors
so this backfired to those anti made in china military haters when basically its actually made in the usa?
Your content is amazing. Thank you and your team for the great in-depth overview! This was awesome.
The part where you discussed transistors triggered a bunch of repressed painful memories in everyone with a electrical/computers /electronics degree. I just had a nightmare about transistors and pop quizzes because of you
That's what I've been saying. Second Cold War is afoot and i can't believe i get to live through it.
16:42 wait is that Pam Beasley?
Wasn't Trump making Chyna pay millions back too our country.
Ya da man Johnny ❤
Brandon bows down to China
:32. “Tiny pieces of metal…” Not true. Silica. Not metal; not glass.
why the video quality is so bad? I dont see youtube option for selecting 1080p
Dude, "2nm chip" doesn't mean the chip is 2nm in size , it's the size of a single transistor on that chip -- and there are billions of those
I feel this video missed the mark
Fantastic job… and I’m an electrical engineer
@Johnny Harris, one correction, TSMC is not state own, it is a public traded company.
US government officials has been bought off by China a loooong time ago. It's a little too late for that now. It's nothing but false bravado at this point.
very good storytelling for the audience that does not have critical thinking...
Another masterpiece 🎉. Thank you for the video Johnny
Johnny is teaching us like they going to erase him❤❤❤ On you tube since 2008 This is by far the best Chanel to understand  Conflicts/Economy/Politics Subscriber Satisfaction  💯💯💯💯💯
Yes because j am clean wiork for mt money not films its their end and me rich beauty work ☺😊
2:03 did he say "alot of cameras"' . As in they DONT contain silica? They def all have silica in them 100% positive
Really appreciate this video (the content and the quality).  I'm subscribed but only saw the short.
Your videos used to be short and crisp, now all your videos are almost 30 minutes to gain more engagement.  While I don't blame you on your reasons, I enjoyed your shorter videos more.
When you can't compete effectively, you sanction and embargo the competition! No more!
Taiwan is NOT a country, it's a province of China, even the American Government knows this.
When China was founded (at the end of 1949), it was still an agricultural country, and capitalist industrialization had only been developed for about 50 years. You said that China’s technology was backward and there was no innovation. I agree. The United States has developed for so many years and is the leader of the third industrial revolution. How can it be possible? It's not logical to just catch up. Most of the technologies in China are learned or improved. Is this shameful? Does the United States feel uncomfortable when using the gravitational force of Britain and gunpowder in China? As for stealing technology, it is even more absurd. How difficult is it to transfer one person's ideas to another person's head without making mistakes? With so many technologies, the crystallization of the wisdom of human beings for one or two hundred years, how can it be possible to master them in just a few decades if you don't teach them or buy them? Americans are all saints. They are all given away for free? The American soldiers are all displaying and stealing technology and don’t care? What’s the point of insisting on ideological confrontation?
Not completely sure, but I don't think Nvidia, Intel, amd, etc, are blocked from selling chips to China. It's only the cutting edge chips that they can't sell to China. I remember hearing about Nvidia basically just changing the way they label their cards so that they can sell to china. Same for other companies, it's not a complete cut off. And most people are not buying the cutting edge cards or cpus anyway. Also, the fabs that tsmc will be producing here in the u.s. are a generation old. They are not bringing their best tech to the u.s. they need to keep it in Taiwan to still have leverage.
Totally NOT super bias. 😆  Hahaha, So America can't copy TSMI or make their own semi factory.  Lets take it from Taiwan 🇹🇼 😄
Thank you Taiwan 🇹🇼
#26 on trending 👍🏽👍🏽
Too late!! There's also a lot of Chinese students in the universities who will be gain the knowledge and expertise and will going back home.
At this rate we might actually see a real Gundam mech built
My brain can't decide whether that's a button-down denim shirt or a long-sleeve tee.
Start a podcast! pls
God bless China. American arrogance needs to stop!
I wonder how the raise of quantum computing will affect all of this 🤔 I don't know much about the mechanics of quantum computing but I think it will change how we use ones and zeros  Will it make silicon semi conductors obsolete ? Will we be switching to another material ? Will it bring in a new radical that might change things ? Find out on the next episode of dragon ball z 😉
My mom was one of the workers at @ Micro chips in Warren,Illinois way back in the50's for the first space ship.  My first video here and will subscribe.  So informative. Thanks
This hasn't started recently, it is years in the making. China has been trying to catch up, mostly by intelectual property theft & reverse engineering as usual, but is still generations behind. The greedy West still doesn't get China has been at war with us for decades, just like Russia.... And we keep sending them money and then acting surprised when shit hits the fan, it is getting real sad...
Thank you and your team for doing this. The very intent of simply pointing to historical unfolding of events rather than an aggressive pointing finger style of "journalism" is refreshing, although one would think that would be the norm...
Thank you for giving me another update with geopolitics
It interesting how when some facts are brought up in Russia, China , Belarus its authoritarian but when Taiwans president forces a businessman to invest its just “because it was that important”
In fact, Taiwan can only be regarded as another political region in China, similar to East Germany and West Germany. Taiwan belongs to China, which is recognized by most countries in the world, including the United Nations and the United States. So stop talking nonsense about aggression. Originally, Taiwan and the mainland have been at peace for many years, but this wave of U.S. military participation in public opinion guidance clearly intends to split China and disrupt China's internal issues. However, they shamelessly said that Taiwan is still a good place to live, while escalating the situation and selling arms vigorously, and then stood on the moral high ground and said that the United States is maintaining world peace and China is destroying peace. In terms of economy, China exchanges cheap goods and meager profits from labor for high-margin products and technologies from the United States. This is a win-win situation. To you Western media, it is low-end destruction of the environment and development itself is stealing technology (American businessmen don’t make money and give technology to China for nothing? It is the United States that calls globalization. It is also the United States that deglobalizes. The United States makes money on its own. , while saying that the people who buy things are dirty and arrogant. If you earn a lot of money from China, China and the United States are good friends. If the Chinese economy catches up with the United States, then China is the enemy). Anyone who has read history knows that the wealth of the United States was accumulated through wars, technology was obtained through the search for talents after the war, and land was obtained through bloody colonization and plunder. How many tens of millions of Indians are there in the United States now? ? Love peace, freedom and democracy? Yes, those who make you unfree are dead. How evil is China! Destroyed by war for more than 100 years, poor and white, relying on cheap labor to start and develop in their own country, it is not like the United States that always drives warships and planes to other people's doors and sends troops to various countries to "maintain peace". Yes, China is generally doing business wherever it goes, and wherever the United States goes, it is basically fighting wars, selling weapons and plundering resources. Now the United States wants China to kneel down to maintain world peace. If China does not want it, it will destroy world peace and stability. This is America!
This was happened months ago
Love you man 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Raise crows and they will gouge out your eyes.
Well look like finally American is making some good decisions
Buy intel its literally 50% on sale and backed by the American government!
Johnny finna cause WW3 by explicitly calling Taiwan a country 😂
I’m scared
Anyone that buys a hat made in China, or more of a financial purchase? Shame on you!!!  Your new iPhone is Chinese made by forced labour, do without
I’m worried that it’s already too little too late. China already has the tech that they can reverse engineer and Taiwanese engineers already work for Chinese firms. Biden might only be delaying the inevitable.
deep dive into traders joe?
Cold war vibes were back since the mid-2000's for me, even as a kid. I had teachers in HS that swore tensions would never rise again. Finally the world is waking up.
“And this is why we have nice things.”
Doritos and computer chips. Next up is breaking little pieces off of rocks
Another kindergarten-level summary by Johnny Harris.  Man, what happened to you?  Analytics, I suppose.  Well, do what you've got to do.
As somebody with a PhD in Evil, this video was profoundly interesting to me- thanks Donny.
I just want to know if you've started washing your hair more frequently now? 😂
Bullshit try again
Can you make a video on brics and how it would affect the US long term?
Your work is fantastic. Knowledge absorbing entertainment. CNN, PBS, and the rest aint hot chip on you. Looking forward to the next vidoementery
What is the difference between trump and biden when it comes to xenophobia and nationalism lmao
7:00 electronic engineers are chuckling to themselves. if only you knew how deep the rabbit hole really goes.
Who's paying for this one? The WEF? Maybe the Chinese?
Two videos, back to back on chips. Chips are so important!
Asia is protecting it's own markets. It's been going on for years. Have you all just woken up? It's not just chips or any other semiconductors. It's anything that is important to the rest of the world. Talk about stating the glaringly obvious.
Engagement engagement engagement
how are people so blind in US, All the wars we are dealing with now is since Biden has been elected
Is it just me or does he look like Bo Burnham🤣🤣(amazing vids btw)
Great vid
Hahaha I love the puns and little humor you put into these videos now. Makes it less depressing and more fun to watch!
Trump was right.... again 😐
That was great
Yeah imagine if the US didn't buy new technology when the next new thing comes out without trash cans being full of stuff that still works but it gets thrown out...
The Evil USA certainly has taken a particularly villainous step here.  Will China be able to recover is the question.
A second cold war is brewing.
Can we invest in semiconductor chip stocks? Is that even a thing? Sounds like a pretty safe investment
It’s incredible that we can make a chip that’s smaller than a strand of DNA.. just mind-blowing! The idea of another shortage is pretty scary..
China´s response will be develop their own technology
Always a pleasure to watch your videos. Very well explained with a lot of usefull information. Keep up the good work !❤
Crazy seeing tsmc stock grow
Good to see and ,nand,nor gate 😅😅😅
We should have been making these ourselves as soon as we realized how important these chips were. My job at ford is on and off because of these same chips. We work for two months, off for two
It's not just that China buys the technology from the US. They often steal it. Intelectual property theft supported or even organised by the Chinese government is a huge problem.
Oof I can feel the panic from all this people from the government. Taiwan was very smart having one of the top dog to protect them
While the US and China fight for old ressources, we just try to find a way to make graphite cheaper in production. Fuck silicon...the next valley will be graphite valley.
So basically USA is mr krabs, Taiwan is spongbob, Netherlands is Patrick and China is plankton
You made this make sense for me!🙏❤️
Does this mean if and when US no longer depends on TSMC, Taiwan is screwed? Since US would have no real interest in protecting Tawain?
Where did u get that wall map in the background?
Thank you! Loved the animated maps! It’s very interesting to see a Birdseye view of the global economic and geographical relationships between the worlds key players in the micro chip industry. This was very fun and informative.
You forgot to mention that Biden is meeting with Dutch prime minister Rutte _as we speak_ to negotiate trade embargo for export of semi-conducter laser piew-piew equipment to China.
It's only going to get much worse for America under Biden since he is literally bought and paid for by the CCP. When millions of dollars of Chinese money is funneled to the Biden crime family via the Penn Biden Center, via Hunter, via decades of selling out America for that sweet Chinese money, via the complacent and Pro China Democratic Party, it is a joke to think our government  run by these Far Left globalists has American interest front and center.
Joe Biden and the democrats were probably the ones who allowed it to happen in the first place. Tech was probably all copied and stolen by now and these aholes acting as if they're concerned.
How can you be a ceo of one of those companies selling this tech knowing what it might contribute to?
Ur the best Johnny. I always look forward to ur videos man.
“Keep it within the family”- the timing was 👌🏾😂
So, teaching sand to think was a mistake?
Wow man , I just want to say I don't know what is going on at the moment but you have this whole puff and when it gets the crux of the history and the geopolitik you just brush over it with massive inaccuracies and the continue on puff
I had no idea
Zonder ASML geen chips, alleen Doritos
So Reagan killed Japan's economy, sounds about right
This is one of the many (!) reasons why the free world needs to protect Taiwan at all costs. 🇹🇼 While setting up advanced chip factories and research centers in the US and Europe is super important, as of now the whole world depends on Taiwanese companies regarding this technology. Unfortunately, just like with Russia and Ukraine it's highly likely that mainland China will launch a full scale invasion at some point in this decade. We have to be ready for that.
Isn't crazy how in the pursuit of profit for a few shareholders, companies handed an adversary the very thing to make advanced weapons??
Would be more correct to say, that The West and not only the US has the technology to make the Machines to produce chips. Since ASML is really important and ASML depends for example on Lenses which can only be produced by Zeiss in Germany
This is a promise: China doesn't need to reunite Taiwan, nor does it currently want to.  China needs to destroy Taiwan, and make the world dependent on China for chips, and it wants to. China will vaporize Taiwan and nobody will retaliate, so long as China can and will provide microchips. Facts
Yeah. Taiwan is the concern now.
go china gooo
Biden? I thought Trump led the charge on that?
Semiconductors is the new oil.
A blockade just asks for it to be penetrated. Another words a WAR. One step closer.😮😢
Im a chinese we do not wanna go war we create weapons in order to protect ourselves  only american wanna invade and rip the precious from u for example Gaddafi 😔 with his currencies of gold to tumble the economie of america !!!
Sorry, you do important and relevant media. But... I'm to old for the "MTV" fast clip mashup videoclimax100% stuff... But, you are probably one of the few hopes the present mobilezombie generation may accidentally stumble upon... So, you are the Socrates for the kids now, a big responsibility... I hope you can cope!
Everything is a computer, the Universe trends toward computer
5:40 in and he's already got the fundamentals of semi-conductors, transistors and vacuum tubes wrong...
Giving Bill Gates credit for anything is really asinine. He is literally a thief that capitalized.
Has begun?)) My friend you're at least 10yrs late for the party
Politics is war without bloodshed while war is politics with bloodshed.
everything has silicon, my bitch got it too
including in dildos...to be honest
This legitimately might be Johnny's worst video.   China bad because they buy a product.   Fucking hell
you are either under the US wing or you're out  the US needed some country to balance the power and end its monopoly on the world, but it is acting like a narcissist another thing is that the US  keeps printing green paper to save its missed up greedy economic system while wreaking havoc on the whole world
Didn't know Biden had it in him.
First Doritos now computer hardware. Starting to think Johnny is OBSESSED with chips.
Jonny. I don’t know how you do it. I love all your videos. Infact, I only open youtube to check if you have made a new video.
TSMC is the only thing that unites Pelosi and Trump.
tsmc is not the first one. you could habe watched the asianometry video at least
Johnny the bend radius on that xlr cable is driving me nuts, please fix it. kthxbai
This is really weird and now the chip shortage makes sense. And it makes sense why China wants to invade and take over Taiwan. This is some scary stuff.
Let me guess. USA good. China Bad. Lame
Another homerun.
Yay used car sales are going up again!
epic
Did you re-release this yesterday or something? I'm almost certain I watched this video a few weeks ago.
Good content but a very redundant video. Could’ve been half the time
This is the first time Johnny has encountered math in his life  "IT'S MAGIC!" 🤪
Good video, though I miss one important aspect: if china blocks Taiwan, it doesn't only hurt the US, it will hurt the entire rest of the world. Which China will more likely not do, than if it would only hurt the US and risk that conflict. I know this would be a big rabbit hole to go into. But a mention would have been nice :) but like I said, still a good video.
Taiwan was part of China. It ws the fact. You tried to confuse people that China want to invade Taiwan because of Semiconductors. Taiwan want to be independent as a country. Of course China will not allow this will happen. It is USA again making trouble water and inseparable between Taiwan and China.
Finally USA grew some spine. We have been fueling Chinas rise for decades now, to what end?
Yesterday, I thought to myself, it’s been almost two weeks since Johnny Harris released a video. He must be working on something long. Then, I see this!   Thanks for always releasing lengthy full scale documentaries!
“Here’s a bunch of money” 💵 ✨
These videos are so informative and easy top digest. Great filmmaking slash presentation skills here 🥳
nice beanie
Great video 👍 👌
lol this is so funny  video to mislead the totally ignorant I just shake my head
China does not play by the free market rules so we are right to cut them off, we should have done it the moment Xi changed the the CCP's laws and become the emperor of China. China is interested is China's power (just like every powerful country)  and they don't follow the free world's model. They have a dictatorship and harshly push down freedoms the west and other free countries take for granted. This should have happened when they took over Hong Kong or better yet then they  began genocide in Tibet.
You forgot to mention that American chip companies are getting approval from the US govt to continue to sell to china, while its allies don’t. So that means it is only hurting the allies while American companies continue to make money.
21:20 "making promise and invade Taiwan and "reunite" with it" you deliberately omitted the fact that Taiwan (republic of China) also was claiming to invade and reclaim mainland. Since they were indeed same country, its weird to use the "reunite".
Hi Nick.  I'm DragonUltraMaster. Nice to meet you :) (I don't know if people has commented this so I did) xD
Intel i9-13900OHIO
Great explanation. Well done, great content.
go on jre
This man has love and hate story with chip.
I wish they made an X-Men movie out of this and also previous events that have been happening lately
wow man !!! you are narrating of information in most easy to understandable way
Brilliant work!
Taiwan 🇹🇼 is another China in a good package 📦
Really informative and interesting!
Word to the wise, don't make comparisons between brains and computers. They're not the same thing. Not even close to the same thing. They are both very complicated machines. But they are not the same type of complicated machine by any means. Non-tech people always do this. They're fucking apples and oranges. Don't think of them as even remotely the similar. Its a false equivocation and not even that useful of an analogy.
Biden poundin fists sayin alrite lol 😂 crackin me up
Finally is back with something interesting than doritos🤟🤟🤟
Trump declared the shipwar first not old Biden.  And Taiwan is a Chinese country by any way.
You missed an opportunity to be eating your breakfast when you said everything in your life depends on chips.
Chips is why Taiwan important and become gold in the world hhh
Tsmc it’s not American and Taiwan is part of China so USA never help China on none so it’s like Hawái whatever we make in Hawái yes is American but Taiwan it’s China so the tetch is Chinese
Say China invaded Taiwan and TSMC fabs were destroyed as planned to avoid them falling into China's hands, what would happen? Seems like all the latest tech such uses TSMC chips. No more iphones, game consoles, and a lot less computers for a long time?
the trade war between China and USA is becoming extremely good for India. Recently apple made a decision that it will make 50% of iPhone in India by 2027 and will make it's different accessories too. Samsung too took out it's business from China and built world's biggest manufacturing plant in India. this is all because of the trade war. so thank you USA to start the trade war. 😄😄
Videos are only getting better and better 👌🏼👌🏼
Nice to meet you Nick!
2:14 i designed some of that radar
Is it two ideologies about the world or just different financial interest.   I'm not sure ideology really matters anymore.
ok..pause...too depressing
Selling the Chinese military American technology that allows them military advantage is very capitalist lol. I'm not necessarily anti capitalism but this is certainly a downside
Yeah the US must have it's own fabs.  mercedes just partnered with nvidia to design and model their factories in the omniverse, which gives them significant advantages in design and speed of construction - overall efficiency. That's an invaluable competitive advantage. US fabs will be required do the same to speed up and future-proof their factory production. China's biggest problem is that they've created a state-automaton-groupthink society, which will always suffer when it comes to innovation.
Loved the 80s background music
5:33 is not a transistor, it's a vacuum tube
Interesting. So China have to rely on America for chips and America rely on China for medicine.   Sounds like it could just be a deal over the two. It’s actually not a bad position it seems…
18:58 Meanwhile US prohibit The Netherlands, ASML, selling those magical laser cutter to China!! It’s those magical Laser Cutters that makes the actual chip magic. This is what China ultimately want.
Begun?  It's Been!
Johnny Harris is for the media, what TSMC is for the computers.
Dear Johnny. You make really great content, but the color grading sucks. Literally, it gives that hazed-warm-soapy-like-in-2014-instagram feel that makes me dizzy. You deserve better color grading, Johnny
Fabs even put art on these chips in nano scale. Search 'silicon art' for some small-scale mind blowing. This stuff is so old it's on the Wayback Machine.
Nothing to worry about Biden said, they’re good folks over in China. They’re not our rivals.
This communist tone that you speak with that implies you're not a citizen and just a stateless observer is simply disgusting.
Americas capitalism greed will be the end of it
Got to say. You’re the best reporter I’ve seen to date. 100%
Cold war never ended, it just took a break. We were on a break!
Cobalt is another story that would be good to expose, it's in almost all tech and most of it is collected using modern day slavery
Taiwan should stop providing chips to chaina
There is only one God. “Within the one Being that is God, there exists eternally three coequal and coeternal persons, namely, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.” God is the creator of everything and is Sovereign over everything. God has appointed his only Son to judge the living and the dead. We have all sinned and broken God’s law, such as abortion, lying, stealing, lusting, anger, pride, etc. God is Holy, Just, and impartial. That is why when God judges he cannot let even one sin from anyone go unpunished and that punishment is eternal hell. We can’t work our way into heaven and our good deeds can’t save us from our sin. The bible says all our righteous acts are like filthy rags. We would perish if we died and faced God with our own righteousness.   The Good news is that God sent his only Son to save his people from their sin. Jesus who is fully God and fully human, lived a perfect life and never sinned. He willingly went to the cross where the Father took the wrath that was meant for his people and put it on Jesus. Jesus paid the price for their sin and died on the cross. He was buried and on the third day God raised him from the dead. God commands all people everywhere to repent of their sins and to put their trust in Jesus. Biblical repentance is a change of mind about Sin. It’s an attitude of the heart, genuinely turning from sin to God. Everyone who repents and puts their trust in Jesus, will have their sins credited to Jesus, and Jesus’s righteousness will be credited to them. Their sins will be forgiven, and they will be given eternal life. When it’s time to face God, he will welcome them into heaven because of Jesus’s perfect righteousness.
It's crazy how technology has advanced so much within just the past century. Thank you for the great work Johnny! Your videos always amaze me, the editing and production is just amazing.
When the empire and the resistance buy weapons from the same guys,..because....money
A collab with a podcaster where you involve maps would be cool.  A historian or story teller like Dan Carlin Hardcore History.
johnny is no longer objective, you push US propaganda nhe dosent even sound the same
Hunter and Joe sold China the chips
Russia didn't stop selling gas to Europe, it was Europe who sanction itself from buying Russian gas to the point where "somebody" destroyed the Nord stream pipelines and now I can't take anything you say serious after this single blatant piece of propaganda u spewed.
you really don't need all of the Jingoism, it takes so much away, or should I say adds so much unnecessary baggage to your presentations. The US Military in 20 years: Illegal invasion of Iraq; Afghanistan boondoggle; the Syrian piracy, the Khadafi Execution. China is on a whole nother vibe than the violent and beligerent White West.
This is so wild
Ronald Reagan was 🗑️
It has nothing to do with military. Simply because USA hates china to grow rapidly. Stop trying to give America any righteousness of doing so, since it has done it once to Japan.
king of soy puns
The amount of time ur using to advertise something degrades the quality of ur content and make me lose interest on what ur about to say or show next .
BEST VIDEO on microchips by far!
man it would all be so peaceful if china just didn't exist
america: lol mad china?? cant make funny computer part?? china: hahaha u are like a small babby, watch this  china: MAKES METAL GEAR REAL like a boss
Protectionism and economic nationalism may be a proper response to economically weaken economies the US doesn't like but it's also creating tensions with its allies (mainly European ones) and every other economy, as since microchips are used so often in consumer items, the economic shocks of restricting them will impact economies worldwide  This may cause other states that suffer collateral damage to orient themselves against the perieved cause. Does the fault fall on the US for blocking chip exports or does it fall on China who because they don't differentiate chip usage for military or civilian use cause the US to respond this way? Well that's up to the narrative  Expect heigtened US and Chinese propaganda as both try to grab onto international sentiments
Congratulation, you made a great video on this matter. Not only did you make it very easy to understand the technology and the politics, but the video is also visually and accoustically pleasant. I cannot imagine how much effort that was. Great Job!
Why is it ALWAYS Ronald Reagan?!
Sir make a Johnny Harris Hindi language  Chanel
Great video! You only might want to fix the captation at 19:21 where the "US" is captured as "IS". Subtitle little difference in meaning
The blockade of chips started in 2018 under Trump administration, Netherlands were kind of forced to block ASML sales of most recent EUV tech to China. Also the spying of companies like Huawei contributed to the ban. DUV sales were still allowed to SMIC, really should have covered all that a bit more, otherwise a good overview.
Block software?? Is that even a thing that's possible?  🤣🤣
Great video, Johnny!
Our silicon chips are now so small, that the electrons can pass through the transistor without the transistor activating. We’ve made them too small to work properly
We need to bring our microchip manufacturing back to the states. Could be wrong but seems like it's all in Taiwan. Dangerous for America. From what I've read what we need to make everything from batteries to bullets is dependent on metals and manufacturing from other countries. Doesn't make me sleep well at night. While I lay there and stare at my digital clock.
OMG! sound design is mind blowing. BOOOM

taking show not tell to a whole new level at the beginning there
It is funny to think about all the conspiracy theorist out there who are worried about being microchiped and it's like bish what do you think you're writing your comments on.
The transistors are not actually 2nm in size. The "nanometer" in the names are largely marketing with very little correlation to the actual scale of the things they refer to.
Now that is a good document
"No China for the last time you're not getting any chips! If you wanted chips you should have got some from the god damn hamburger store!" - Taiwan probably
loLol
Free market does not mean it is free of laws including state department restricted trade lists.

FABulous 😁 nice document
This is what Americans mostly don’t understand when criticizing aid sent to Ukraine. If USA allows Russia just take Ukraine for  itself on ground of it being integral part of Russia, they make a precedence for China to take Taiwan. Hence, Ukraine’s survival is vital for USA national security.
This is a very good video from US perspective, however it is a bit off on the reality in China. There are always two sides of the story. The video totally ignores the fact that China has the ability to manufacture his own advanced chips, even though not as advanced as US. China also has his own Fabs, EDA companies, equipment manufacturers and material supply chains. China's latest 5-year plan is to achieve intelligent manufacturing by 2025, and 10-year plan is to achieve 70% chip self-reliance by 2030. These plans are made even before the chip war. Nowadays China uses his own indigenous chips and Operating Systems in their supercomputers, satellites, space station, militaries and other key industries. By the end of 2022, China achieves 25% chip self-reliance. Yes, chip war makes it difficult for China and prolong the process to achieve self-reliance. However, even without the chip war, China is intended to change the course of chip manufacturing and pursuing self-reliance anyway as planned. The war just makes China going full throttle in indigenous semiconductor industry.
1+1=10
One of the best videos I have watched on YouTube recently !
Just saying the U.S. has had super sonic missiles for awhile, why would they tell the civilian public.
One thing that I have to remind of you is that Taiwan is not a country. China is still under the" Civil War". Taiwan is only a government like the "South". So, there is not an "invade". And this is the basic principle which makes Beijing re–connect with Washington.
Loved this!
Such a great video, keep up the good work!
i like your music choice in your videos. specifically this video.
This video is for people who have no idea what's going on. For a far more real-time and productive observation,  youtube "年代向钱看“ and ”关键时刻“
Dont forget ARM! Ignore hypersonics its just FUD
#TaiwanIsNotChina
is this thing called "Matrix" by andrew tate is real? try to post a video about it
This is leading to another cold war
Why are u not in Facebook
But doesn’t china have all the resources  so I would say they are not in that weak of a position
Doritos and Micro , When It comes to chips , Johny is just tremendous !  Great Work bro 👍
I hope he knws deyres ghost n I his apartment lol at 1:50
So I guess my question now is, is China already set up that blockade? And if not why doesn't Taiwan or the US set one up first? I'm probably missing something like the US being that close breaks some kind of treaty. Or maybe Taiwan doesn't have the navy power. But then it becomes why don't we help Taiwan build its navy power?  I guess I'm trying to figure out the military steps and what is or isn't possible.
All planned
I like how the US shows clear and obvious political and military action towards protecting its important national resources, but its somehow a big conspiracy that the US is just exploiting the middle east for oil by installing dictators and sponsoring terrorism.
This's incomplete Video. Johnny Harris need little more research.
Trump started it. Gotta give him his credit even though I’m not a fan.
If you want a deep dive on the production of Integrated Circuits I would go watch Asianometry on YouTube
i thought trade joe's chocolate was found to have heavy metal?
This is amazing video!!   Crystal clear concept of chips business👍
Hi Johnny, I love your video !!!!! You have explained this extremely well, so now I finally understand only thanks to your video. What is really going on here regarding China, Taiwan, and US war !!! It all makes sense!!! Thanks for explaining it !!! At the same time, the US would not give and damn about Taiwan if Taiwan would not be making these chips !!!! China would not care about Taiwan if they would not be making these chips. So it is terrible that poor Taiwan would be completely abandoned if they would not have this chip industry there !!! This is so sad and disgusting !!!
Interesting video as always! Might be a bit biased since I’m Dutch, but I feel like you didn’t really highlight the significance of ASML and the Dutch-US relations in this. 90% of the machines that make the chips are made by ASML. The Dutch government banned export to China, under pressure from the Biden administration. Our prime minister visited the white house earlier this week too. The EUV machines made by ASML are so advanced that that even if China were to receive an EUV machine, it would still take them years to understand and be able to make those machines themselves (or at least I’ve been told so). In a decade or 2-3, ASML came from non-existent to being market leader. Moreover, there was a huge scandal about a decade ago where Chinese spies infiltrated ASML. I have some minor knowledge on this but if you have the time I would greatly appreciate another video on this! Chris
chips -> doritos? yum yum (sorry i am still thinking of the doritos video)
Semiconductor, microchips, integrated circuits are not the same thing.  And those are not metal. Vacuum tubes are not transistors. Ok, there are a lot of mistakes in this video. Not exactly misinformation though.
ummm can Mexico turn in the next China?
Hey Nick 👋, 1:50
Anyone else notice the other crew member standing awkwardly in the background when Johnny was carrying the camera around? I kept expecting there to be a callback to that, but I guess it was just an accident.
This video helped me understand some things, thank you

Hi Nick
The more time passes the more Reagan seems to be the root of problems
First we exported our industrial Capacity to China, Now we're doing the same thing with innovative tech. The American Bussines men don't care about the health of the nation as long as they get paid.
I wouldn't be surprised that these governments have already developed something that is so small that they could just put into any devices that u are using or even making it as hidden camera to spy certain people.
So American companies sold out American national interest?! Very Nice! Awesome video, super informative. If you're reading this, make sure you watch it.
17:48 I was waiting for my country to pop up...
Still trust vaccines lol
China is expert in back engineering and copying, so empty fabs factory or bombed factories are gold for china.
Globalization works when the United States didn't start a trade war with China... as soon as they felt they were losing. This guy has this dog whistle conservative vibe around him.
12:26 "Back of Taiwan's mind" hahahah
I am glad Biden took some steps to reverse the governments line of Bull in terms of shipping technical parts to our communist enemies   The government needs to get the internet back from them and acquire all the properties they bought.back.
Johnny Drama
taiwan is china tho lol
Thanks Johnny, for the incredible amount of work you put into mak the these videos.
Johnny delivers yet again. What a masterpiece!
How much more  small are  the transistors gonna gettt ?
Paul Pelosi has already made huge profit from the chips act!🤣🤣🤣
In Germany, VW and Land-Rover are buying washing machines by the tons to use their chips for cars. 🙈
30:05 Because it’s not globalization and interdependence that allows and encourages states/people/businesses/ to use that interdependence as a weapon, it’s capitalism. The structure of the economies are the problem, not that they are interconnected.
Let’s be 100% clear. The US has done bad things. Terrible things. With dubious reasoning. But the single greatest threat to the overall mostly peaceful situation in the world (fewer people, and smaller % of population, die from international conflict every year than ever before) is China. It’s a country with massive aspirations for global dominance, massive military spending and development, and an overall disregard for human life.
Taiwán no es un país, si no parte de la República Popular de China.
US biggest nightmare - RUSSIA , INDIA , CHINA (RIC)….almost an AI superpower.
The comparison that US blocks chips to disrupt totalitarian regime getting more weapons, and terrorists russia blocking the gas to europe, is not just "blablabla"
The reason why China got ahead with u.s. chip technology is because they push the boundaries when it comes to the limitations to try to find out if there's a way to make them faster than they normally would be or whatever and they probably didn't Master simulations that's how they got the ability to get that supersonic level we were using wind tunnels to do our test while they did massive computer simulations speeding the timeframe up we're not using our technology to its full potential they are
Im a computer sciences student here in Mexico, and becasue my career belongs to the electric engineering department, I hear a ton from electronic engineers. Professors and Researchers have mentioned that the US has been doing some pre-talks to make Mexico the new Taiwan and sponsor fabs here. Mexicana de Semiconductores, anyone?
Nothing will happen.  The blocking of imports and exports is just an excuse for the US state to get more funds.  China is not going to invade the US because it is its main source of trade.
Hi Nick!😂
I really wish to see your video regarding AI Technology such as Chatgpt.
80 % or so chips semi chips made im Taiwan hahaha were fucked
Too bad Silicon isn't a metal eh.
Bro relax 😌 we had the yf22 and 23 in 1997.. we had the u2 spy plane in the 50's relax these are just the things declassified. The usa 🇺🇸 black budget is larger than the 700bill in defense 😳 I think we got some military technology nobody has even herd of
Wow, hooked beginning to end.
Fascinating how we use electronics daily but have no idea how it works or the geopolitics behind it....Thanks for this video
Never thought this China-Taiwan tussle was even about Semi-conductors, talk about mind opening. Awesome video.
I keep trying to find your non existent podcast! You should just put the audio up of these videos on Spotify. I’d listen
Why do people watch his videos??  Johnny is unintelligent and all he does is copy out some magazine article he's read.
In order for cooperative systems to work, everyone has to play along. And the biggest player is the one who makes the rules.
I really enjoy your videos for several reasons.  First, is content. Second, is execution. But I must admit, I like your voice and the way you talk. The voice is very important to me, when it comes to someone who plans to make a living with it.
The Taiwan already started to building in US. microcips ,because Taiwan and China are close to the war.
Man I love your videos!!! Keep up the great work my friend.
johnny doing his second video on chips
You are one of my favorite journalists when it comes to deep dives.  You remind me of Matt Taibi before he blew up and became more popular.  Keep on grinding these incredible stories out!
More misleading Harris talk. Arm chips is the leading the design, it runs your phones etc. That's British designed not American.
I got very hungry while watching the video
2nd cold war indeed
9:45 fabs
This guy seems smart until he talks about something you understand, his definitions for electronic concepts aren't totally wrong but extremely imprecise
I love the music u use....wanna know where I could  listen
Well it's kinda good that it's trade war and not nuclear war at least.
Major correction. Taiwan is not a country but a province of China. The whole world including US subscribe to the one China policy. Get the facts right
i just can’t understand how a country that was supposed to be such a superpower was caught with their pants down with c0v1d supplies AND we’ve let a tiny country nextdoor to a large political adversary have all of our systems by the balls because they make all of our chips. its time to get the grandparents out of the decision making process in washington dc.
Wow the movie the departed was way ahead of its time!
Wow now scaler is sponsoring American channels also
“Begun the chip wars have” -Doda, Yoda’s nerdy cousin
China can still buy chips from McDonald's 😂🤣
Excellent video, extremely concise and more objective than even media outlets. Great work
Hi Johnny, I LOVE you when you're NOT unnecessarily woke. This upload is amazing. One of your bests! Along with yung Borders series. So good that it brings me back to watching your stuff. I checked out because of your unecessary woke comments on fb. I hope you stay appropriately woke. Not unnecessarily woke.
Dorito chips?
this is one of your best videos, I think.  Chips chips chips, Doritos, microchips, chips...
The Kardashians have silicone too 😊
Also, remember people. Silicon and Silicone are two different things ;)
This video is going to be MASSIVE 760K views in first 22hours.. 👏 🙌
What a Video man loved it
Amazing stuff, Learning is so easy through your videos. Love from INDIA ❤️❤️
The cold war 2.0
Last years news.

@Johnny Harrys, that AND logic port that you are showing is not a transistor. You need more than one to make an AND.
Its a shame that things have to come to this in our world. Instead of working together to make our world a better place and perhaps boost our race to the stars for much more needed exploration, we have to endure super powers building better tech than each other to use for war. We have already seen what war is like... Why can't we just end conflict and work together to achieve bigger and better technology that we can all benefit from? Because one power wants all of the power.
Well-researched videos. You did miss China's local gains in chip manufacturing and the hiring thousands of Taiwan-based engineers to go work in China.  Anyway, unfortunately, China is not Japan, it's its own universe and this is not a battle the US is going to win i.e (containment of chinas growing power, which is what this is all about), even just based on the fact that they literally are 40% of the world's market and if they altogether stopped buying TSMS chips it would collapse, affecting everybody, but they won't (just not yet).   Companies like Nvidia are still making advanced Chips for the Chinese export market like the A800. The US banned the A100 from Nvidia but with their market share 70% down yr over yr and 400m loss every quarter they still needed China  Also, Silicone-based chips are reaching their end, getting diminishing returns in performance vs cost as they get smaller. China is already a world leader in the new iteration of the next advanced chips, graphene chips.   There are still other aspects of making a chip that matter like the supply chain, but literally, because China is aiming for domestic production of its own Chip, hired the best Taiwanese engineers and only needs the chips for their domestic market(at least for now), as soon as they have a breakthrough then it will be another Space station scenario where American/Taiwan companies are banned from selling any products to China and they go through a long long long recession(40% of their market gone). Unless they find consumers somewhere else in emerging markets, like AFRICA(where I am from, Kenya), which unfortunately they colonized for so long and people are more favourable to China or at least cautious about the West. Same with the middle east, Saudi Arabia etc. This is what happens when you try to enforce monotony of ideas instead of being more accepting of different cultures, which is sort of how we got to this battle in the first place.  China is pouring billions into investments. The only way for the US to beat China at this is to stop their local innovation, somehow, IDK, beg them to stop or attack their overall economy in some other way which they cannot because both are each other's largest trading partners, a trade war would hurt the US like the other one and make it look like a bully in the world stage.  The stage is definitely set for China to win this one, I don't see it going any other way. If China were not its own big market like Japan, then maybe this would work. But it's its own big market, and it is also the largest trading partner for like 95% of the world which is insane. They really do play a long game don't they compared to the election cycle US.  And China knows they are going to win, just look at their reactions. They are engaging diplomatically so they look good and inviting cooperation with other countries in all things (even the US got invited to the China space station). They are setting themselves up ready for the world stage.  This is a long as chase game and the CCP is like a grandmaster. The US can surprise you sometimes and also has a lot of really smart people. So can't wait to see how this plays out but I think my kids kids might not ever know us was a power once. And it ALL depends on these chips and the race for supremacy
It is funny how trump wanted to bring jobs back to the US and this is how a huge amount of jobs actually come back to the US
I think if you are gonna bring up Nancy Pelosi, you also need to bring up that she is invested into these chip companies very heavily and she (and her husband) even made some huge stock movements before arriving in Taiwan. Additionally, she came to Taiwan without agreement from very many people in the US government. Making her action even more questionable.
I would like to say how good the production value of these videos are, the visuals, the sounds and especially the music, i love the ending music with the cello (i believe), it's just so good.
freedom and democracy = riches bank balance
its almost as if when america talks about freedom and democracy what it really means is what benefits it economically or what benefits those at the top economically. No micro chips in Taiwan = why would the US care about Taiwan
On the news room ...would be a good podcast name
this has to be one of the best videos by jhonny harris
It didn't just now begin.
I can't believe you didn't eat a single dorito
To know how complex is a chip.... Lear about logic gates..... trust me your mind will be blown.... 😏
'math' ?? ..its maths ffs...im off to do some physic....dont understand why americans have to change the english language.
1:50 Hi nick 👁️👄👁️
That blah, blah, part is critical.
5:32 Hey, that’s not a transistor, that’s a valve. It’s what transistors replaced. The whole reason why computers were so big is because they used valves instead of transistors. Please make a correction.
hi I'm nick 😃
1:51 Hi nick!
not all semiconductors are microchips though.......and you mention as much later when you describe what a transistor is......so how the fuck can you erroneously call them the same thing in the beginning of the video?
Just think of the reason why Japan attacked US in WW2. They blocked their access to a military and economic vital resource because they want to prevent their Navy to get bigger and bigger. Not saying that will start WW3 - just interesting coincidence. History repeats itself.
Imagine how many of these chips have been put straight into the trash dump or scrap yard...smh
YOU FORGOT THE CABLES IN THE STACK OF SILICON
great video
When you said "I am now going to eat........" at the end of the video....I could have sworn and bet you were going to say Doritos😂😂. Hopefully one day, we can share a bag of doritos😁
I can't get past how he pronounces silicon as "sillikin"
Come home or the justification for Taiwan occupation/ enclave ?
Hi Johnny, I just wanted to make one thing clear I am totally missing in your video. China is able to set up everything to create a supply chain for microchips except for one thing. EUV technology, which is invited by ASML and no one else can compete with the performance of this technology. No one will be for at least 30 years from now (is my believe). Now luckily for the US they have a crucial supplier for this EUV machine allowing them to put restrictions on ASML EUV machine exports to China.  Apart from that, the argument that US is scared for China's military tech development is kind of bullshit. China can use less "high tech" chips to be able to achieve the same performance as a "high tech" chips have. It is just an excuse for economic reasons to put the restrictions on ASML to not export the EUV machines to China.
how 'bout crisp and chips?
The US government threatened to strip Americans working for Chinese chip companies of their citizenship if they didn't quit immediately. I didn't know they could do that. Effectively render one of their own people stateless. Pretty wild.
Being an engineer in ASML, I must say you did a great job explaining the whole thing. Great video as usual but I wish you had talked more about ASML than just saying magic laser machine makers. Having a monopoly on lithography machine  manufacturing, they are not less of a player than TSMC in the global chip supply chain.
Some foreign company just bought off a new reserve of copper and other metals recently in Pakistan. Right from under the nose of our corrupt and incompetent government. And then media just went silent on it. Honestly this is the real life deep pockets shenanigans right here. If we have incompetent governments like these then what id the difference between pre and post colonize nations?
Dude, taiwanese has spoken, Tsai is not in the presidential position anymore because she lost votes to the oposition. Its very obvious that taiwanese ppl didnt agree with Tsai about coming close to the US and leave China behind.
An analog chemist with a hat full of air?
I'll never be able to comprehend computers.
Data is the new petrol... chips are just the miners
On a geopolitical level, Russia is not in this loop at all so is headed for a caveman future. Its belligerent behavior recently has resulted in massive sanctions which means that it will only be able to source small amounts of microchips on the blackmarket for its weapons. That is if they don't blow the world up before that demise happens.
one plus one dose  not equal ten (7:02).
The FinFET war
26:30 just a typical day in Ohio to build chips
Did anyone notice their is no pakistan in the map in the video. Harris bhaiya supporting akhand bharat 🚩😂
Where is the ChatGPT video, I am waiting, Hello?!?!?!?!?👏🏻😎🤨🤔
did you ever think about the countries, their efforts, and pay that actually get that silicone out from the earth? it's as mind-blowing as developing a 2nm chip.
Japan got santioned to death by the US. Crushed by competition you say? Thats very bs.
US and western world wants to keep high-technology as their own and prevent developing countries manufacture high-tech products. China will smash their plan.
Johnny, we need a video about what OpenAI means because I'm certain that we won't know what to do with it until Gen Alpha become teenagers are start doing with it the same that that teenagers have done with new ways to communicate since time Immemorial.
The sad part of this with China is that it was the west that made China strong. Everything we have is Made in China. Yes, they're hard working people but in the end our money is buying the bullet for china that one day in the future will kill your son or my son.
Great analysis!
So let me try to understand... the US holds the world hostage due to his chips power, but fears China to hold the US hostage? Who is the bad guy here?
Grandpa Joe whipping China. Rightfully so.
Samsung is crying 😢 in the corner !
Remember when Pelosi almost started a war for her own investment portfolio
When will India wake up dammit
Woh Didn't expected Scaler as sponsor
Mr Jesus lookalike sounds like a supremacist in disguise. China has done nothing to offend the US other than the sin of developing faster or catching up to the US. He pretends he does not know that and talks as if China is an invading and warlike nation.  hmmm guess which country has been engaged in one war or the other for several decades now? Lets stop pretending that because we are in the West that we are objectively right and that what we stand for is for the greater stability or good of this world.  If anything, we are far more likely to cause conflicts and refuse to countenance competition, as shown by Reagans 100% import tax on Japanese (an Ally) chips.
I'm surprised that ASML wasn't mentioned
The Waffle House has found its new host
Even any phone charging cable have chip/s inside.
This guy needs to pay royalties to Casey Neistat.
Now silicon buttz and chests
This is a great video. Great explanations, great presentation, and I am considering Scaler. Liked & subscribed.
dont forget that the Netherlands gets to decide who wins this war! im talking about ASML
Bro you have missed one bit of data, Annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China for these precious material for Semi conductor manufacturing
But how can people know about a war inviserble to man I mean how did it manage to evade so much of humanity then hay you say the world attention for years to come how when we are so unaware because chips are not something we have any real insight into mate not sure I agree with that fella on your part West media does not go too great lengths to report details of this matter so highly unlikely son not saying we may not maybe one day however I hold no hope because we live in a very complex world and control over the world information is very much used to prevent a great lot of wealth of information on topics witch are vital for us from Marcus in australia no comment needed or like.
So much trash in this video. There's no chip war and China doesn't need chips just for its military, that's pretty much the last thing it needs it for. EVERYTHING, ALMOST EVERYTHING runs on microchips now. From your fridge to your toothbrush to your car to your freaking buttplug!   It's not a "chips war" there's the US wanting to slow down China's economic growth and that's about it, it's not about the chips it's just that in the modern economy chips run pretty much EVERYTHING and the best way to stifle any modern economy is to stop its access to chips.  "more importantly they want to continue to build up their military" 🤦‍♀ more important than making their economy viable?
8:44 bill gates is the original savage
this channel never disappoint
Ugh, why can’t the H,omo Sapiens who run these countries just get along?
Johnny, the Axel F rip off is a bit distracting. Just sayin, Ive dated myself, I know
Omg not again... first mental breakdown of the year...
Wonderful Video sir, however small correction, Taiwan not country sir.
wow amazing stuff thank you very much
China still has the economic disadvantage of having an authoritarian government but despite the title 'Communist' Party of China, it isn't communist anymore. Massive economic reforms by  moderates after Mao died lead to China becoming a mixed economy which is exactly what lead to its explosive growth these last few decades.  TSMC, which is mostly Chinese people, currently has the most advanced chip fabs in the world. China has around 60 times greater population. The Chinese economy is now second largest in the world in GDP nominal and first in PPP.  If one extrapolates that the per capita income of China might one day reach approximately that of Taiwan's, by the end of the 21st century the Chinese economy might be the size of America and Europe combined.  In other words...if current trends continue  China will dominate the global tech industry including processors. Mind you by then the world may have shifted to sharing quantum computers accessed remotely.
China is stealing Technology, buying western high tech companies, prevent purchase of own key companies, is further becoming a total dictatorship and want to have influence in the whole world. It is absolutely right to prevent china to steal our key hightech Industry
China is ready to mass produce chips .. so much for the blabla in your vid - could have waited a couple of more days before pressing the upload button
this was a fantastic video Johnny. 10/10
I just hope China overtakes US soon
American greed at play
Maybe i am less surprised by this because I know the version between Edison and Tesla (nikola, not the company named by him by Elon musk). And how one battle over the flow (pun intended) of electricity impacted the direction of global trade and commerce, and thereby global history politics and geopolitics. People who wish Nikola Tesla (the Serbian) had won believe in an alt history fiction genre called “Tesla punk”
Awesome journalism !
My alma mater university in my area is likely about to go on strike! People who paid tuition fees etc are suddenly about to either have their lives upended (if the strike goes ahead) or stagnate (if a deal is reached prematurely out of fear, and working conditions contributing to brain drain continue)
Where did Russia get its Chips from?
No man, not Scaler! :(
Correction: IBM's 2nm transistors are not actually 2nm big. The name is just purely marketing and that's been the case for these processes for awhile. The physical limit of transistors is around 5nm because around that scale you get the effects of quantum tunnelling happening making the transistor useless. The actual dimensions are three transistors stacked 75 nm high, and 40 nm wide. Bit disappointed this was missed
microchiips will turn china into East Taiwan
Hi I'm Nick
I've been watching your videos for a while now. The Scaler add made me subscribe. Thank you Mr. Harris. You are an amazing storyteller.
Your content is second to none. Thank you again to the entire team for the commitment to deliver quality content. FYI, I am one of the many waiting for the podcast.
I don't understand why USA needs to limit China's ability to make chips. Why not let them make the chips? They have zero creativity and can only copy anyway so we will be ahead BY DEFAULT.
Thank  you .     ( 2023 / Jan / 19 )
Ah, I'm kinda disappointed that you didn't mention a lot about the Dutch company ASML.  In my opinion, they actually play one of the most important roles in the supply chain. Their EUV machines are the only ones in the world that create the few nanometers circuits so they're the most responsible for how small and precise microchips are today!  From TSMC fabs to multiple companies in the US, everyone relies on these ASML machines to print the chips. On the geopolitical part, I think ASML doesn't completely agree with the US and wants to continue their relations with China (there is already an ASML branch opened in China).
Another invisible war that we're fighting involves computer hacking, where people who've got enough hacking skill could steal classified information or create viruses to take down big corporations in other countries.
Only thing that I don't like about this guy, is that he is panicking a lot.
Heyy Johnny, Long term follower here. Please work on the length of your videos, maybe cut 5-7mins ?
my life depends on Doritos.
I'm a welder/fabricator in the semiconductor industry. Our role is at the very beginning stages of semiconductor production. We fabricate the frames by hand, that later get integrated with the chemical deposition tech which produces our chips.   Was awesome to see some of the political insight covering this topic, my livelihood, and would love to see some further coverage in the future. Great work.
As a businessman from a Third World country in Asia who has been around the world every month except during the Pandemic. China is winning!
This is just China being treated in trade like they treat everyone else they can get away with doing so to.   *smallest violin intensifies*
Your insight towards  the world is beautiful  Don't stop  your videos!!!!!
0:32 They are not metal.
Hmm yes Taiwan whole existence is to be defended, so they exclusively developed chips for the US🙃🙃🙃
1:40 whole table of crap made in china. "china is just a consumer". Chips arnt really whats important. People, land and energy is, and we are having trouble competing. This isnt action, its desparation. Its gonna be funny looking back in 20 years when the BRICS decide r fate.
10:09 *several specs of dust visible on the wafer.
We should never underestimate the ability of humans to create violence and war from anything or any situation.  I kinda hoped for a bit there, that we'd grown up. But no. Children having tantrums are running the show again, and being fed pure sugar by the evil teenagers who run global corporations
Guess we can always go back to analog.
I hit the like button when I learned why semi-conductors are called semi-conductors.
There is no war: China lost.
Taiwan is a small country? Since when Taiwan is a country? Even USA don’t recognised Taiwan as a country.
I wish he would just dead pan it… all the lil sassy moments are beyond cringe.  They give soyboy wojak vibes
It's good to see indian owned company is sponsoring this kinds of videos
This does feel pretty US centric. Which it is fair enough. But the US is not just blocking US companies from selling and hurting their profits. It's also preventing other countries like the Netherlands from selling their stuff to China. A huge reason why the fabs in Taiwan are useless to China if they take over Taiwan today is that there's no prior experience etc. If the Netherlands does end up selling the EUV machines necessary then China can prepare. They can train they can build up supply chains. And then taking over Taiwan both becomes less important and more easy.
Another interesting point is how much further can silicon technology even go from here. Only in a few years we've gone from 28nm chips to < 5nm chips and are literally trying to break physics to achieve better results by going smaller. Kinda scary to think we might hit a plateau of some kind that results in no more insane innovation in this space.
You forgot to mention that Ukraine is where most of the silicon comes from and the war with Russia is making things crazy expensive. Everything has chips and the pandemic etc
I'm getting tired of these China videos
Let’s go Taiwan let’s go 👏🏻👏🏻
#FJB
Hi Mr Know All, what is Taiwan’s official name?
used to work in ane of this FABS(in israel).  this work is realy hard, 12 hours shift in this wuful suits and the scadual is always changing- one week morning shifts the other week nights shift. the FAB is working all the TIME!
Excellent video, I learned a lot.
A couple decades late buddy. What do you think SOPA and PIPA were? How about the countless other legislations both US and EU have tried to ram down our throats? All ways to try and privatise internet usage and hopefully completely militarize. But we the common people are NOT soldiers. Nor should we be. To me a soldier's job is to make sure no more soldiers are needed. If they need to fight their leaders failed their jobs in making sure soldiers van uphold theirs. And that, again, is the job of the legislaters. To make sure people uphold their promises. But that's not what these fuckheads do and so the problem is, always has been and, if we don't do something soon, always will be the politicians!!  Come on people
Why does he think thhat China is a agressive, giant and big bully?
What a chip off the old block!
The difference is that cutting chips from China threatens their technological and military advancement while cutting gas from Europe threatens the lives of millions of europeans during winter.
I vote video of the year right here!!!
❌. Bla bla bla ......
It's far to late.....
Don’t start a podcast. Just stick to what you do best
Did Russia also steal US technology to build their supersonic weapon? This video is full of glitters (effects)  but no gold (truth) It sad to watch Americans buying their own lies. Anyone who understand technology business will see the mistakes in the US chips policy. Advanced chips are overrated for now, and the Russia v Ukraine war is telling us a story about weapons and modern warfare. The US is importing engineers from China and this guy just said that "The Chinese will not be able to operate a chip factory in Taiwan if they invade and find chips in TSMC factory" Most of the chips that the Chinese are buying are for products that ends up in the West.  I won't be surprise if this video was scripted by a US government official.
Every Country with oil and microchips are by default protected by the USA
Great video! Thanks
And there, Ladies and Gentlemen, we hae the real reason why the United States will defend Taiwan against China. It's no more about freedon and Democracy than the Gulf War. It's about ulterior motives and if Taiwan ends up being taken over by China and the CCP the United States stands to lose their bread and butter in the semiconductor industry. I'm not saying it's a bad reason. They just need to be honest about it.
If the US is trying to move production back home they will be able one day to no longer support Taiwan and then its over 🙈 btw as a German I see a lot of fab projects here too now. Governments and companies take the learnings from the chip crisis quite seriously.
always the best videos. i learned a lot again.
Ridiculous, the USA become super power by using its military power to kill/threaten other countries’ citizens and got richer. On the other hand, China got richer mostly by working harder. For example, the US citizens wanted to consume more than what they could produce. China used the opportunity and got richer. Now all these countries, not just only blaming China for growing faster but also trying to take credit by saying that their “technology support” helped China to grow faster
Yes my life depends on these bag of ruffles that is facts
China would not have been thriving in their mix economy, so they're only good at is copying the US. And this is why a lot of Chinese students come study in the US on a visa to find internship or a job in these semiconductor companies, and steal intellectual property.
Johnny, your news story is the best of its kind!
We Humans are mind blowing
you masked of how they need us for all the imports and how one ship make more polishes then x cars in there life time is so big
Excellent video. I would just like to point out that, the reason for China being the biggest customer for microchips is because it is manufacturing many electrical products for the rest of the world. And out of the top 20 manufacturers who purchase semiconductors in China, more than half of them are NOT Chinese companies. With the speed that these companies shifting the manufacturing base out of China, it won't take long for China to be dethroned from the top microchips buying country of the world.
I enjoy your videos, maybe even too much.  However, watching them I get some Cleo Abrams vibes. It would be so awesome to make a video with her.
Taiwan is not a country, even America do not recognise them as a country. The Taiwanese president that was pushing for independence lost election because the Taiwanese people are more interested in stability and peace than Western backed independence that may lead to war against China. STOP THE MISINFORMATION.
Your story telling is next level.  You deserve much more recognition. Glad to find you. -- a new subscriber
Johnny got very unique way of explaining
28:54 noo i want my 5090 ti :(
hey mr smart, the chips inside your fridge or speaker are not important(i can  build them in home) for this is about only 0.01 of chips, the -150 nm chipsets Moron make a research before making video like a smart guy.
🤔
So glad you are covering this topic! I am in the middle of writing my thesis based on Taiwan and China’s relationship and the microchip war is a big part of it. So I really connected with this video. Great work!
Reminiscent of the USSR's attempts to copy western computers by reverse engineering.
the world is metamorphosing to something else
A podcast would be amazing. Invite politics, history, sociology professors. Invite scientists. Invite politicians. Invite speakers from different political institutes (Institute for eastern european studies, institute for the study of war, etc.)
The article was exciting, and it amazed me how Johnny repeatedly disgraced some multi-billion dollar news outlets.
We learn alot from your videos. Thanks. Greetings from Bosnia and Herzegovina
There's a channel called asianometry that goes into chip manufacturing.
“We are at a stage where interdependence is used as a weapon” This is so hilariously stupid that humanity does this. In any other system this would result in a catastrophic failure. Like if the heart stops beating to make a point to the rest of the body that would be the end of you. Humans like to fight for things like power and control without actually knowing why they fight for it. They just do. As if they are programmed to do so. As long as governments exist in the way they do today and power is in the hands of a few human beings wars will keep happening. Democracy is flawed because it puts immense amount of power in the hands of a few people. Just like capitalism. If the system does not change humanity will always be at war with itself.
Let’s go Brandon
While in the US they spend the last 25 years creating rules and regulations for the manufacturing industry, blocking new industry to grow due the "green agenda", increasing labor taxes, promoting strikes thru the unions and forcing the actual factories to outsource in other more industry friendly countries.... The train have passed and the technology is being produced else where now. I do believe now it is too late. It is not an "if.." question. It is a "when.." question about chine to dominate the technology.
I recommend the Joe Rogan podcast episode with geopolitical strategist Peter Zeihan. It’s a very insightful conversation.
800+ billion dollar military budget and China is ahead 😂😂
Opium War ... once again
Hi, Nick! Nice to meet you!

All this talk about chips but where is the fish?
You forgot to mention that China produces almost all the silicon in the world, and that if they wanted they could strangle the market.
Thank you for making this video.
Was this video made in the 70s by a dork by a dork in a  beanie in the 90s
I'm a software engineer and am going to ask an incredibly naiive question. What is an 'advanced' chip? Is it merely something with lot of transistors? Does advanced mean higher clock frequencies (which we've already hit the limit)? is it as simple as saying advanced = nvidia a100?  It bothers me a little but to not know that meaning, love the video - also check out Asianometry
The most importantly the chip designers in the american companies are mostly Indian its almost half of the engineers working in theese companies so yeah US is dependent on indian designers to make this possible. Awesome vid love from India
31:15 all made in PRC
China has cheaper labor lol, they will dominate the industry
You are so stupid, you make actual reality harder
When the US decided to ban China from the "international space station" in 2012, we started building our own, launched in 2022.  I am firm believer when the US and China works together, everyone wins.
It's all in the build up of chips doritos to micro
I'm a democrat  but you beanie guy are full of shit, you need to actually need to learn, and know what you are talking about
Forgot to mention that Carl Zeiss, a German company makes the lenses for that ASML machine
Great video on this chip issue between US and China. I do want to add to the points presented in this video that this chip war isn't all for geopolitics, it does have a business case as well. For years, Chinese government has been actively facilitating intellectual theft of foreign technology, usually in violation of their own laws or WTO rules. It is common knowledge in China that intellectual property rights are rarely protected, and only when government-backed entities' bottom line is of concern. Big name companies like Intel/Microsoft/Cisco have all been victims of that. In the long term, it actually helps these businesses to operate in a well-regulated economy, instead of having their engineers' hard work being ripped off to be sold pennies on the dollar or undercut their own businesses.
I've been aware of this stuff for a while, but this is a good vid to help me explain the significance of TSMC to non techy friends
👏👏👏
When you look at how many students at US universities are Chinese, and then look at how many of those students end up working at US defense contractors with security clearances, this all gets scary. China is playing the long game, and we let them knowingly do it for a quick buck. It’s naïve of us to assume they don’t have the knowledge to make the technology work without us— they’re already involved through agents placed in the US and Taiwan
17:14 Actually from 2023 onwards india beats China and became most populous 🇮🇳
Was actually a fairly interesting problem that Kilby and Noyce solved. Engineers up until the point they decided to use Silicon were using multiple different materials that were optimal for the conductivity. Then both of them independently found that Silicon were perfectly adequate when doped with other elements, and radically simplified the production process of ICs. Suddenly the flood gates opened. Another interesting story, Japan spanked the living heck out of American companies by picking their battle when creating chips. They decided to out compete the US in memory production. At first there was denialism, until AMD came out with hard numbers to show that Japanese memory failed by an order of magnitude less than Japanese memory chips.
id expect if china really needed microchips they may start making them on their own after the us blocked it from them
You are such a dohche, you are clueless

Lol, well America will need to contend with China. I am just glad India can bide it's time and continue growing at 7-8 percent every year and become the third largest economy by 2030. Tick tock. EU is going to be screwed in the process. All that wining and dining is in danger.
I may not always agree with all of his opinions, but when I see a new J.H. video...I know I'm in for a wild ride of information, entertainment, and top tier production 👌
Oil + Chips + MSG = U.S  love  Doritos.
1:30 yo mama, silicon
你是美国人，我是中国人.你认为芯片重要，我认为领土重要. 这很有趣！
If you are able to broadcast this on their MEDIA it's a thing they want us to see.
As a Taiwanese, I have to say Johnny, you're the first foreign Youtuber I've seen who actually get all the stuffs correct, a lot of western media such as CNN BBC, they don't even know that TSMC is TSMC today, it's because of the special chemical supply from Japan, EUV laser machine from Holland, and therefore even if China take over Taiwan, they still won't have chips, because due to political reason, Holland and Japan are most unlikely to give them the materials and equipment to make the chips(ofc along with Taiwanese chip making technology) but if you look at CNN and BBC's reports, they always try to tell you "China's about to attack Taiwan just so they can have their hands on chips", which is so misleading, but you got them all correct!!  If you're a TSMC stock investor, you should've got it all figured out(Taiwanese know about this years ago, and some of us even try to remind the western countries, unfortunately they didn't figure it out until 2022 and 2023)  Sometimes I feel sad that Taiwanese aren't only working hard for the chips that the entire world needs, but we're also defending democracy on the front line(Taiwan is currently the only Chinese language speaking country that has full democracy) Yet, it seems we still don't have enough support from the world and from US. I know Biden already told the media multiple times that US will use its military to interfere China's attack if war breaks out, but white house always sending an opposite message to Taiwan, telling us it's not happening, it just create an uncertainty to the Taiwanese society and government  I mean look at South Korea, they too make chips, maybe not that good, but they still got American troops install in their country, and US taxpayer pay for it, on the other hand, Taiwan didn't have that privilege, what's more is we always have to pay out of our pocket to buy US-made weapons to defend ourselves and the chips for the world, it feels like we're on our own all the time. US needs us but won't really give us the help we need, that's what a lot of Taiwanese is thinking nowadays.  Not to mention so many Americans they just don't know and do not bother to know all these, they don't even care about the war in Ukraine, they only care about gas price went up again(that's literally what's going on with my American coworkers and my American friends here in the US), which makes me worry more about Biden's promise, because after all, aiding Taiwan is not up to only president's call, but the Congress, and Congress also care about what American society thinks, it's just not looking good to me.
god damn peter zeihan was right
Hello ! love your content, what i love absolutely the most is how objective and well researched your videos are!  i really hope you can do one about lebanon's weird history and situation, i would love to help for insight on that as well as i am very credible in that if we ever make contact you would know.
Remember, PRC right now is a communist regime. If you look back into the history, especially the cold war, you know what this means. For Communist regimes, whether it is USSR or PRC, their goal is to destroy America, which we the freedom lovers don't want it to happen.
Good video.  One major mistake.  Yes 92% of chips made in contracted fabs are made in Taiwan, but not all fabs are contracted.  When you count companies like intel and micron that number is much closer to 70% than 92%.
Definitely should start a podcast, it should be based on geopolitics.
Nice to see Scaler being advertised on International Youtube channels
Why does the United States have chips but can't build hypersonic missiles
Ah yes, the marvel of engineering, smaller than a strand of DNA, just so I can look at memes while taking a dump. Science!
I’m about 21 minutes into this video so far I have to say you’re doing an excellent job of explaining this but one thing I do wanna point out is that even if China does buy the designs and etc. from the US they would not know how to make their own designs from scratch because if that was the case Taiwan when it only be able to make a CPU that runs at 1.2 GHz and it’s only a quad core CPU it’s much much more complicated than that like you can’t just review someone’s work and expect that to give you the experience to build your own chips that’s why we even allow chip manufacturing outside of the US by US companies also another thing I would like to point out China does not have super hypersonic missiles we don’t have the materials that would allow the shelling of the craft to fly that fast either it will burn up completely or due to the friction from the air it will just dismantle itself that is why we have never seen the video of the hypersonic missiles we’ve only had them a ledge that they have it
Actually it is silicium, not silicon.
“To strike back at the US”  As if America is the centre of the world. This is more than America vs China…
China will surely steal some IP related to chips. Mark my words
Please go on the Joe Rogan podcast!
As I am an Electrical and Electronics engineer ,  this episode amazed me a lot.

I don't know why I watched this it's all old news

Frankie is back in Hollywood.
Fascinating video! Also thinking about potato chips every time you say chips makes this video much more funny. Especially coming from the Dorito episode.
Why cant countries just work together and advance the space tech, that way each country can just find it's own habitable planet and stay out of each others way. The universe is too big and still waiting to be explored.
Biden in this video:  hero confronting a rising China, scaling back semiconductor technology, disrupting global supply chain, realigning the new world order  Biden in real life:  c'mon man, you know the thing
Great video
Virus is 14nm, and a mask works for CV-19 🤣🤣🤣
Hey2 media, "Microchip/ Chip" is made by semiconductor (silicon, etc.) but NOT every semiconductore are called/ NAMED "Chip/ Microchip" (example: Diode, transistor, etc.)
Hypersonic missiles are flowed and not a threat yet no one has a working one
From what we learned previously, your life also heavily depends on chips.. 😂
coming from a country that has lost almost all of its industry except for mining i can respect Reagans decision  Australia is fucked when it comes to trade and loosing industry to overseas  Jonny can you do a video about our shitty government from an outside perspective it would be interesting  thanks 👋
FINALLY covering this topic. Thank you for this!
This is one of the best videos on the current state of our world I have ever seen.  I am 56 years old and I have seen alot of videos on this subject.  VERY well presented!!
You give me so many Portland vibes😅
Maybe it is already late
@Asianometry how accurate is the video?
2:21 When your interests in porn become extravagantly specific and you're now only into a totally dark frame with green text at the bottom
One other way in which on-off switches have changed the world is that reliably turning on and off signals from one end of the world to another in mutually recognizable ways allows us to communicate globally, instantaneously and reliably.
[23:45] Imagine making a video just reading these papers all out with Joe Biden's face spinning...
Kissinger and Israel have stolen US tech for decades, and have given it to Russia and China- this is an indisputable fact.  #SynagogueOfSatan 🇮🇱
At eight minutes and fourty three seconds... Bahaha♡ that shit made my day! Like three pies, but I hadn't seen that one! LOL that's gonna give me joy all day, good sir.
yeah and we taiwanese people are the sacrificers
還好台灣已經是民主國家，不需要美國的民主快遞。現在怕的是共產黨來個共產快遞
Thanks for the very interesting show.
It's Less about chips and it's more about geopolitics.
Prepare for the CHIP war comrades. See you in the trenches. O7
Question is : why do we need all that technology for ?
Mmmmm chips...
when you play dirty no one want to play with you, Mr. China
I live in a cabin.  This isn’t my problem.
GEE for a capitalist channel... lot of governments giving PRIVATE companies money.... odd.
I have a feeling that china will invade taiwan in the 2024 us election
Either bring manufacturing back to the USA or closer to like Japan, which frankly makes the most geopolitical sense out of the bunch of Asian countries there. India would NOT be a good choice in my opinion, I prefer Japanese folks cuz I feel they wouldn’t have an ulterior motive to invade and seek conquest on an international level. Especially with the USA who spared them back in WW2. It also helps how Japan is the only country I’d feel safe walking in their streets without knowing the language 😊. They don’t have a government problem as far I’m concerned, nor a truly powerful one so they really are the USA’s best partners, period. The only issue I have with Japan is that it seems they’re accepting more and more overseas foreigners seeking work in Japan, particularly more so from other Asian countries. I really think that’s damaging for their nation and culture as a whole. Take this from someone who live in a multicultural Canada, it is not a place where people trust each other or see one another as “Canadians”. Trust me, don’t let your country and nationality decline and then disappear into wokeness. Stay conservative Japan, and that must include borders!
Since Trump, the US has had a ban on the most advanced chip technology export to China. What's different about the current much broader ban is all chip technology. In terms of the military tech keeping China ~3 generations behind is enough. The new ban is th destroy the Chinese economy. The chip ban by itself may not be enough so the US is arm twisting Europe arms to stop trading with China.  The economic war doesn't just hurt China actions that hurt China hurt America, even if China takes no retaliatory actions.  If we impose sanctions on Iran it hurts both the US and Iran but Iran's economy is so smalll compared to the US it doesn't hurt the average American much. But China's economy is roughly the same sized as the US. And our actions will hurt Americans.  But is this because we're afraid of China invading the US? No, but US is the global hegemon. And as the global hegemon we get to invade Iraq on a whim. We get to bomb Libya for no reason. We invaded Afghanistan.  And before that we bombed the Serbia when Yugoslavia broke up. We started 14 wars since 1980 and many more regime change operation with no one to Challenge us. US hegemony is what this economic war is being fought to preserve. No one challenged our regime change operations ultil Syria. Russia miliarily intervened and fought Al Quida in Syria, Al Quida funded by the CIA.
I always enjoy your videos.  Thanks.
Great video , I already knew that the tension of US & china were rising because of the micro chip technology  In Taiwan. I do believe china will invade Taiwan someday & it will be  very unexpectedly .
The strategy of the United States is a three-level world, the core world (the United States itself - design), the semi-marginal world (the European Union, Japan, Taiwan - manufacturing) and the marginal world (Russia and other backward countries - providing raw materials)  For this point, you can take a look at Albert's world introduction video in detail. But China is breaking the US hegemony strategy.
If a country is subsidizing an industry it violates free market principles. That’s why it makes sense to punish them with tariffs to offset the subsidies.
The free market is amazing for civilians and enriching all our lives, but it clashes with the game of power played by leaders of nations.  No matter how far we come, we're still a bunch of tribes fighting over the best land to hunt game, and the best berry bushes to gather from, or soil to plant crops.  I wonder if paleolithic humans also had situations where resources were sufficient for the entire local population and the majority of the members of rival tribes were cool with each other, but the tribe headmen/shamans/whatever leaders wanted to beat the other tribe.
Lool keep changing title
Taiwan is not a country, it is a province of China, period.
I love watching these anti-China videos so much. He keeps reminding China that they are taking the right path. Yes, we refuse to be American dogs. China is never like Taiwan and Japan. This is a game to change the rules of the world. This is an ideological struggle.
I need to know where i can get one of those huge maps Johnny has on the wall
So did you not want Reagan to do that to Japan in the 80s?
I have talked about this 15 years ago.  Why can't people see this???!!!
Only in Ohio
The transistors themselves are not actually 2nm.  The node size used to be gate size but now is somewhat abstracted from any of the components,  it's more a brand name.  So - a virus may actually not be a terrible scale.  Nonetheless your overall point stands that they are very, very small.
i tot that bargaining chip joke was funny why u embrassed by it
it’s over
A great job! Thanx for the informations..  With love from Africa!
Glad you realised the world works this way, the way it has always worked.
China always beats the US
Great video like always
Superficial! But fair enough to make the stupid Macdonald's understood.
Tiny pieces of metal... But silicon is a semiconductor.
I really love how he discussed the importance of chips. Now that chip manufacturing is returning to the USA, can other trust worthy countries like Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines be an alternative option?
From Doritos to semiconductors, Johnny sure knows a lot about chips.
It’s so mind-boggling to think that we can make transistors less than ten atoms wide now 🤯 — We didn’t even have rockets one-hundred years ago!
It's still about oil and food. With two ships we could cut of China's oil supply at the Malacca Straights. A few cruise missiles would blow up the pipeline from Russia to China. China would run out of oil in 2-4 weeks. They're already in a drought and water shortage that's impacting their Hydro power generation.  Globalization sounded good, but it was a lie. Entities that didn't live within your borders dictating immigration, healthcare, speech and other policies crossed. the lines. Countries lost their national identity and sovereignty to bureaucrats in Brussels. In the USA started following their trend, when the world use to look to us as the leader in policies and keeping the peace. Globalization is finished, along with woke culture. But it won't go down without a fight.
17:12 actually as of today India has become the most populated country
Not a single Mention of ASML?
Fabs will gain access to the quantum realm if they keep making transistors smaller.
tits, silicon.
So smaller is more efficient
@1:37 really electrics have chips yummy. We have widely available 4nm stuff. Is the news to anyone?
Lets keep it in the family
i am so grateful for this video. you have no idea how long I have waited for this
Great reporting good sir!!! I am enjoying how you put these videos together. Keep it up!
After Japan and China. The next is probably India who would got hit by the US giant economic baton to the ground after they got good at doing software or something.  Or they would invent some new kind of threat narrative to squash their rising. . Or both.
Who's in for Jhonny Harris podcasts?
It’s China vs the World
Let me get this straight. So if there's country that think that their first priorities is their own country they're bad and WTO need to punish them by embargo them or give them sanction. BUT! if it's US or any country that US allows to do that (for the sake of their benefit) we're OK with that? okay, got it.
People forget that the USA pretty much invented every piece of modern conflict.  Nukes, Airplanes, computers, the internet, space travel.   But China has a stable communist country with billions of people.  They happily enslave people and do what ever it takes to get ahead of the US.   China is in a expansion phase and the US is not.
❤️❤️❤️
OMG Johnny has a Fellow Stagg kettle
17:49 Germany manufactures the hyper precise mirrors used in those machines...
Most entertaining video so far!
America's going to win you know it. America will play dumb and lie to us.😑
I love all your content and video my friend its very helpful and  I discover a lot of things thankyou.
25:47 wow, what a warmonger statement there
good luck USA y'all gonna need it
Storytelling in this video is absolutely incredible, it kept me on the edge of my seat. The war on chips is truly an eye-opening topic, I had no idea how deep the issue went. Great work on bringing this to light!
Johnny reminds me of the Professor in Money Heist. Excellent work Sir!
i love this latte hippie from la
F*ck the Chinese government. It can starve for all I care!
Love how the US is shocked that China is more superior militarily when their own companies are selling every advantage to China... a communist country. That meme of shocked face with hand over mouth is the US gov 24/7
Am enlightened. Thanks Johnny 😊
Hipster but smart. Respect 🫡
Please.., please..... please do not become like Vice....
It must be from silicin valley lol
China will just steal as they always do
The Panic in west Is Real , past - UssR today China Future India.
The music editor of this channel is on another level 🔥🤌🏾
China has its own fabs company named SMIC. And it's not so far behind TSMC, producing 40 nm chips and even 28 nm recently. And, surprise, military does not need a 2 nm chips, it's completely fine with something around 90 nm for the most of the stuff
This is NOT a new subject. However, in your defense, your average person, at least in North America, probably has no clue.
Ok. I have been asking where the first silicon microchip came from? How on earth could a "human" ever have created one in the first place? Heck look what they had for the first Apollo...apparently less power than a simple calculator today! Please somebody point me to a documentary that simply explains how a human put millions of switches in silicon to create what we have and are developing like 60y after Apollo? Surely these silicon chips were given to us by much more intelligent entities? Like how did the first two guys suddenly just have the ability to place capacitors was it? (Sorry if they were called something else *tubes originally I recall?) Like how could human hands place these 0/1 switches on silicon?
THE CHINES ARE NOT USING CHIPS TO BUILD THEIR MILITARY. THIS IS U.S LIE. CHINA IS LEADING IN SO MANY TEC SECTORS THE U.S IS AFRAID OF CHINES RISE. REMEMBER THE WAR ON TOSHIBA AND OTHER JAPANESE COMPANIES. ITS THE SAME PLAY BOOK.. CHINA HAS ALREADY PASSED THE U.S IN 6 G TECHNOLOGY. SINCE  THE U.S CAN NOT COMPETE, IT ACCUSES OTHER NATION OF MILITARY OR SPYING. REMEMBER TOSHIBA? TAIWAN IS NOT A COUNTRY, TAIWAN IS A PROVINCE OF CHINA.    WHAT THE HOST DOES NOT SAY IS CHINA ALSO HAS A SEMI CONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AND  HAD A 7 CM BREAK THROUGH. CHINESE COMPANIES DO MANUFACTURE CHIPS THAT ARE NEEDED FOR THE EVERY DAY  GOODS THAT WE ALL NEED. CHINA IS THE WORLDS LARGEST MARKET AND THE CHINESE CAN ALSO BAN ALL AMERICAN COMPANIES FROM DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA COSTING AMERICANS BILLIONS IN LOST REVENUE. CHINA ALSO CONTROLS 90% OF ALL GLOBAL RESERVE OF REAR EARTH MINERALS WHICH THE US NEEDS. WITHOUT THESE REAR EARTH MINERALS THE U.S CAN NOT MANUFACTURE MANY OF THE HIGH TEC PRODUCTS IT NEEDS. WE CAN MANUFACTURE CHIPS IN THE U.S. GREAT. BUT MANUFACTURING IN THE U.S IS VERY EXPENSIVE.   IF WE LOOSE THE CHINESE MARKET, THE WORLDS LARGEST CHIP MARKET, WHERE AND TO WHO ARE WE GOING TO SELL OUR VERY EXPENSIVE MADE IN THE USA CHIPS? CHINA CAN ALSO FLOOD THE MARKET WITH LOW END CHIPS MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR AMERICAN COMPANY TO MAKE ANY MONEY ON THE GLOBAL CHIP MARKET. THE U.S MAY HAVE UNLEASHED CHINES INNOVATION PUSHING CHINA TO INVEST HEAVILY IN THEIR SEMI CONDUCTOR SECTOR. SINCE CHINA ALREADY LEADS IN 6 G, ITS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE CHINA CATCHES UP. FINALLY. THE BRICS NATIONS INTRODUCTION OF A NEW RESERVE CURRENCY. SINCE THERE  HAS BEEN GLOBAL DECLINE IN THE PURCHASE OF THE AMERICAN DOLLAR, A 20 TO 30% DECREASE IN THE PURCHASE OF US TREASURY BOND WILL DESTROY OUR ECONOMY WITH MASSIVE INFLATION IN THE U.S. THIS WILL MAKE EVERY THING SO EXPENSIVE OUR MONEY WILL BE WORTHLESS. IF WE CONTINUE THIS ECONOMIC WAR ON CHINA WE MAY BE ISOLATING OUR SELVES BECAUSE CHINA IS THE WORLDS LARGEST TRADING PARTNER AND I DO NOT THINK EVEN U.S ALLIES ARE WILLING TO DESTROY THEIR ECONOMIES TO MAINTAIN U.S GLOBAL DOMINATION AND HEGEMONY.
WHAT A VIDEO, the quality of you and your team's work is actually insane
The problem is that while the US has been comfortable underestimating China and its strength to catch up, China has been catching up behind the scenes.  US better stay awake and vigilant
“The most populous country” Not anymore😅
My god, the Biden administration actually did something? Proud of them.
As always America doing what it does best hide behind wars it create in world Ukraine Afghanistan Taiwan japan Korea Syria list go on them stupid they America is helping but basically it is destroying
Better start investing in Pringles and bottle caps😂
Being an engineer in the semi-conductor industry, none of this is news to me. But this presentation is so phenomenal, it hooked me in for 30mins straight. Jonny Harris is undoubtedly the GOAT🐐 of content creators.
High time the world diversifies Chip manufacturing to multiple countries, otherwise we're fucked
One of the most amazing story teller 🤌
This video was needed in 2021
If you understand that Taiwan is part of China, the military who is completely department is the US on China to make chips and integrate into not only military but all complex goods the US needs to exist.
Hey Johnny, you are right that there are geopolitical tensions rising between China and the U.S. in regards to semiconductors; however, according to a recent opinion article published by Foreign Policy magazine about lessons learned from the War in Ukraine, one opinion caught my attention, which was that of Anne-Marie Slaughter the CEO of New America who argues that instead of having mutual assured destruction, countries in the midst of these tensions should have a new practice called mutual assured Cyberdestruction or MAC for short (And yes this does involve special sauce that suddenly doesn’t sound BIG nor special anymore but kidding aside).   What Anne argues is that MAD is unsustainable because of how radioactive Earth will become in a worse-case scenario nuclear war, but with MAC while the consequences will be very equal to that of MAD, the radioactive component is left out, and while societies will still collapse, it will not result into turning Earth into a radioactive wasteland, but rather something that is more gradual, and perhaps maybe adaptable with time (as long as you know how to play the game of Logistics like the Swedes do or if your name is Bear Grylls).   I predict the negotiation table will be key to avoid a Cuban missile crisis like scenario by allowing MAC to become the way forward regarding deterrence capabilities in this ongoing chip war.    https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/01/05/russia-ukraine-next-war-lessons-china-taiwan-strategy-technology-deterrence/#anne-marie-slaughter
I think this video came to mind when you were making the one with Dorito chips.
Your ideas have conflicted. You say Taiwan is a country. While you made a video that it is not.
Taiwan is an independent, democratic country
Coincidence: the day this video comes out Biden has a meeting with the NL prime minister on chips. In the NL there is ASML, the only company able to make machines for FABs that makes the highest tech chips. Strategically maybe more important than TMSC and still selling to China.
Tldr; It's fair and game as long as US is winning.
theese counrties going to war bout crisps ye
Okay.... now are we ready to understand how  we are a Corporatocracy AND A TECHNOCRACY?  Not a democracy...
My dad has worked in the chip industry for over 30 years and I’ve grown up hearing abt this so it’s nice that you’ve given it a spotlight
Dang your videos are good.
USA women’s
The cat's already out of the bag. It's only a matter of time before China makes its own if its not already doing so.
USA
China got everything by reverse engineering and bribing people with lots of money.
This is mind-blowing! I'm an Electrical Engineering student and I know the value of Chips, I'm a Geo-political Enthusiast and I understand the value of Missiles and all the stuff. But these two together, Never expected to create a havoc of this magnitude! Plus Kudos to Jhonny's storytelling ❤️
I am surprised that you got the overall history of semiconductors correct, though I believe that the government originally did not purposely entice high tech citizens to go back to protect themselves from china. From my understanding, the science park was created as an attempt so taiwan could leave more base level manufacturing (like clothing factories and other things) and have more higher tech industries. The semiconductor part was a bet that really paid off, bc fabs was not a popular idea. Also fun fact: the government built a special school in the hsinchu science park specially for the kids of those who decided to move back and work in the hsinchu science park. There was a time where if you wanted to enroll in the school, one of your parents had to work in the hsinchu science park.
Johnny Harris hats off!!
There is silica in lots of plant as well
And of course the Chinese government anticipated the US chip blockade
Bro’s slowly turning into a hobo each episode.🤣 Still good videos tho.👌
We can all agree they are all liars 😭
Not just china....
We are learning the hard way that outsourcing everything to maximize profits wasn’t a very smart move…
Fake news my guy
There’s no war… China is done. Won’t even be a country by 2030. They lose.
Do unions next. Rich history most dont know about. Like where the word red neck came from. Its a beautiful label once you find out why
Why did 28:14 cross my mind though? 🤪
I actually have a whole chapter on semiconductors in physics  But never really understood it  But then Johnny comes out with a video on semiconductors  And I end up 2nd in my class  Thanks dude!
Brother, I do not like journalists for the most part. But you do a PHENOMENAL job. The rising sense of free thinkers and autonomy has only excelled with newer generations. Keep doin it!
Taiwan is China
TSMC, USMC... hmmm
I feel like there is a really big miss in the video in not bringing up ARM, which isn't US based silicon tech, but is now used in most cell phones, Mac computers, and largely vast amounts of smart TVs, smart devices, etc....  this is the largest power shift in the silicon industry since, forever.
Brilliant work!
There is one thing you completely missed... All the rare earth materials for making electronics are coming from china, they have the worlds largest deposits of rare earth elements
China test new missiles , its a WMD aim to threaten the world. US test new missiles, it a weapon for deterrent and world peace.
"It's on your digital clock it's what makes our world go round. Poetic
There is one thing you are wrong about. It's not completely stealing tech from the US, all around the world there are talented people who can make them. China has the world's best ranking universities and research scholars. Their research culture is entirely different from the US or any other part of the world, so far as i know chinese researchers are pretty darn good and it's easy for them to create software for chips and design them. China also has fabs, and they are rapidly expanding them. Americans always think.. They have all the knowledge in the world and the rest of the world is dumb🚶‍♂️
I’m back. The video is great as usual
Mmm actually it's usa who stopped a Chinese phone company to produce it's processor because it's was better than apple processor... So let's face it , if don't count Chinese ingénieur coming in usa , them Russian have more 17% more ingénieurs for alf of the us population... And you think you can compit with the Chinese? Was wrong with you guys?
I loved the video, and the storytelling.  I think you missed two significant points.  Please look into China's years of  stealing intellectual property (lessons learned) from our companies that design the chips: and new reports that they're now designing their own chips for themselves and Russia.  If these reports are true, they're possibly writing us (US) out of the supply chain picture very soon.
Cake or microchip?
Do you have the chip inside of you? Or your just main character?
@8:45 yeah!
Just wait until China bans the export of its rare earth metals that are needed in the production of the semiconductors.  The US imports 78% of China's rare earth metal exports.  Its a dangerous game to play to bite the hand that feeds you.
30:58 "our"?
But they can’t do that anymore because it was banned.
USA vs China, The War You Can't See = IT`S CALL COVID!
Both of them are winners in micro of other things. Like down there for men
Don’t call China a super power. They are definitely not that. They are the biggest importer of food and energy. How do you call that a super power? One blockade in there looking at a famine. Problem is they got a little bit of power and they got way power drunk. Showed their ass and got a spanking. Now they’re finished.
all a load of crap, the second this dude mentions pelosi I'm out.
If you are working in any of these high tech company get ready to be honey trapped by Chinese agents
This is the best news I've heard in the last decade.
So China is literally waiting for the USA to run out of ideas for making the chips smaller, then they can take it to reap all the benefits. Just like a ripe fruit that the USA planted.

Time for some chip destroying solutions. Mo chips mo problems.
The story about American greed leading to selling tech to China avoids the nasty truth that China also has engaged in technological appropriation to a dizzying degree.  Why invent things you can just steal. Why innovate when you can just repurpose, relabel, and modify.
Don’t forget this bill contributed chip shortage last couple years (who we directly or indirectly paid for it) 😢that manufacturers hoarding those chips. It also break trust of cooperation cross countries.
Taiwanese unificationists always are like "the US will push Taiwan into a proxy war because they don't care about Taiwan's interests, they only care about their own interests." Dude, not letting China take Taiwan IS THEIR BEST INTEREST. Meanwhile a white guy on YouTube sees the picture clearer than half of the Taiwanese people.
One of his best videos.  Super informative and really useful to understand this issue today.  Thanks for putting images to narrative.
China is ahead of America in technology by using American technology , Irony !
I actually started to have faith and believe in Johnny’s infos and news then multi million news agencies content
ur huh.  You don't actually believe that horseshit do you.  "China used the US chips to get ahead of it".  That is the cover story so you will focus your thinks on it.  While the "real" show happens in the, other, hand.  NOBODY, (especially the puppet master), is going to show their hand.  The very fact that, "you know" this tit-bit of (the game).  Proves it is (propaganda), (a lie), or my favorite (horseshit).  The US is so far past silicon that understanding.  Understanding, by us "dolts", is impossible.  All logic breaks down, when the action takes place at the itty bitty level.  Quantum laws are like that.  This next page in the show will be unbelievable.  Nuclear weapons, will be see as child's play.  Oh, this next chapter will be so exciting.
Yes do a podcast. Talk about maps. Or Switzerland. I'm sure there's room for that too.
Can't we just move Taiwan next to Texas? Wouldn't that solve the problem?
China already lost lol
AWESOME. A great short history of electronics as we know them.
Great video.
Investments go to where the market is. Cutting off China is not even possible.  China consumes over 60 percent of the total chip production. Btw, TSMC is part of the Republic of China. Who makes over 97 percent of the high end chips per year
I mentally added Dorito Infront Infront of Chips event time Johonny said it. Made this video much more interesting than it already was
Nancy Pelosi made tons of money with this Chip wars lol
Hi John, great video again, even no particular comments about the perspectives inside the video....kind regards from Donald at Suzhou, China
5:00 I feel it's a misunderstanding to say that it was all the wires that needed to be replaced with semiconductors. Before semiconductors, the calculations were done with vacuum tubes, and those are quite big. The semiconductor replaced the vacuum tubes, not the wires.
12:20 China doesnt want to invade Taiwan to reunite it with China.  Taiwan is a part of China that is governed by the Republic of China.  Under agreement with the People Republic of China, the ROC they can continue status quo in governing Taiwan.  The only time an issue will arise is if Chinese Taipei wishes to become an independant state from China.  Something the PRC has stated they will not allow.
