I love guy’s sense of humour and how he knows so much abt uncle roger 😂
5:36 😂😂
Haiyah Uncle roger, why your arm so WEAK. So WEAK!
0:43 I thought Uncle Roger and Nigel was the same person
5:40 5:42 5:44 5:44  sus
this is heaven for jamie oliver.
1:05 He‘s just a guy
Excellent PR, loved this.
0:43 is that uncle Roger or a twin
I think he went to Bangkok for 'more' than 'chilli jam' 🤣🤣
Are you sure he is your 'nephew'?  He looks so much like you! Unless you have a twin brother 🤣🤣
6:25
I know why Guy likes Jamie Oliver. Not because of his cooking skills or cookbook, but because Jamie Oliver is Tracklements top customer. He made money for the company.
Haiyaa, why so weak.
Uses and recipes for chili jam are needed.
That Tracklements CEO should get Jamie Chilli Jam a visit… see Uncle Roger for more.
Uncle Roger , you are real magic . I`m smiling watching you even till air raid alarm and rusian drones and other things (that much far from fried rice)  fall from sky. You can make people laughing and  happy when  they facing top critical sh1t . God bless you , Uncle Roger ! Greetings from Ukraine !
Is Uncle Roger and Nephew Nigel same person or separate I am confusing answer me pls❤🎉
Mr. Guy is literally the chillest one out there
I❤❤❤❤❤ Kuala Lumpur
some day Jamie Oliver will show up
"We just don't need it (MSG, we use natural flavors," the guy says, completely ignorant of the fact that MSG appears naturally in mushrooms and tomatoes..........
Wasn't this the perfect collab? It's a nice gag for nigel and great free promo for Tracklements.
as a chili jam fan, adding it to rice disturbed me
so humble
Lao Gan Ma Chili Crisp is the real deal! Try it, it is good for you!
"I didnt know this place could get any more whiter"🤣🤣🤣, its like reverse racism at its peak
I think I gotta buy this company chilli jam.Those spices in chili jam gotta looked hella nice!😂😂😂
Nah bro, people bringing msg to his shows only to get stopped by security for "a different type of white powder" is diabolical 😭😭😭
uncle roger acting so well I always thought nephew Nigel is real
Love the shorts - 7:56
Where was the love sounds the Uncle Roger got felt up? :D
their tartar sauce is next level
5:26 haha the guy doesnt hand him the tool, not joining in this performance hehe 😂
Damn this editor is good if he can make uncle roger appear twice in the same scene Unless they’re two different people
Please do another one, Guy is fun
This influencer era is going so strong, that the company invited him to take away the negative remarks he unintentionally inflicted on the chilli jam people.
Uncle Roger, why so weak? WHY SO WEAK?!
This actually made me wanna try chili jam the way it's intended to be
I live in bangkok!!!!
That was kinda mean telling him he's square.. I felt bad for him a bit lol
There is a chance that Jamie Oliver has used one of the jars of chili jam made by Uncle Roger........
Can’t hold bucket of sugar?! Why so weak?!?!
So you want to tell me, that somewhere on a shop shelf there is chilli jam jar made by uncle Roger ?
8:56 some egg fried rice haiyaa
Nah bc he visited one of his hells chile jame factory and Jamie Oliver’s kitchen
The CEO looks like an easygoing and kind person.
Philipines uncle roger😊
I just made shrimp carbonara the other dayband used MSG. Definitely stepped it up a bit.

5:55😂😂😂
I tot uncle roger & Nigel Ng are same person. 🤯🤯
Bro your editor is just f*****g hilarious
9:11 I don't like Jamei Oliver and I'm in uk
_bros chili wonka_
Sometimes I ask my mom for a rice cooker because it’s faster I’m White
Chili Jam need to save its names as it is not the issues, someone’s cooking is the issues 😂
instagram = instashit <3 NAILED it absolutely love this guy!
2:10 The CEO is roasting him back! Good job!
so its not even little bit spicy, if they werar in tabasco factory they would have to cover face, eye googles and wear masks
4:45 he say soo heavy but people hear soo sexy simply pls don't ban me
Chilly Wonka!
Its so strange to me that they allowed  to film it. Try coming with the camera  to chicken  factory or pork etc , you will be lucky  if they dont call police on you
Pls type glory of Hong Kong it’s a illegal song in Hong Kong and China
Nephew guy chilli jam deserve uncle title for making all the white people eat some spice. Maybe one day nephew guy can learn to make sambal then he will do more than talk to his jars 😂
Bruh, the guy is chill af
Did you poison the last batch?
Love Uncle Roger....love chilli jam too. Can't choose - fuiyoh !! 😅
BANGKOK? damn I’m late for two years
Uncle Roger so weak haiya!!! 😂
5:18 Uncle Roger so weak Haiyah
That bloke is the most bloke a bloke can be a bloke 😅❤
Secret flavour of chilli jam, "children" 😂  Don't trust Jason, he's the one that preps them 🫠 Look at the way the boss chuckles when you ask him, "you kill people here?". 🤣
This guy was a great sport! V good, makes me want to buy his chilli jam. Uncle Roger is jokes

Im from Chile 🇨🇱 and now I want to try chili jam 😊
Tracklements looks like a great operation and it’s so nice to see that uncle Roger was able to be flexible and enjoy his time there, even though he hates Jamie Oliver!
Guy Tullberg- "Dont give recipe away"      But... evryone can see this🌐
10:18 It got nice kick to it 'punches the air'
Nephew guy sounds like a british Arnold schwarzenegger
Uncle Roger: Jason, we NEED to COOK.
Are they twins?
I love how you are wearing the orange high vis jacket over your orange polo🤣😂
Uncle roger :find out what is chilli jam  Me:me too😅😅
Jamie Oliver: *clicks on video*… oh my… *unzips pants*
what about HK 😢
Uncle roger are you afraid of the super drunk asian simply ming Don't be afraid roast him! Haiya! He's drunk 25/8.
Honestly, this was a really good video. I’m so glad the CEO went along with your work, and even had fun with it.
“Don’t give our secret recipe away” Proceeds to film the process
WHY NOT HONG KONG????? :(
0:25 I thought nigel and uncle roger were the same person
do at malaysia
Honestly I would love to work somewhere like this
Jamie Oliver’s wet dream.
6:44 "Taste of  *R E V E N G E"* I can't with his reaction in this part, that's how you imagine Auntie Helen in there, Auntie Helen is vengeful. 🤣🤣💀💀
Oh man I can’t stop laughing
Auntie Helen is in deep trouble 😂😂😂
i dont get why they dont make a real chilli jam, with only chilies, sugar and something to make it last
1:29 as someone who lived in the uk for 6 years I can confirm what he said was true it’s always dark wet cold and ugly or really foggy
Why does Uncle Roger look like Zach King in the thumbnail 😂
Wait uncle roger is a twin? 0:35
Uncle Roger naughty naughty😂
Bro u both look the same 😂
2:00 thats actually true bc im asian and my mum used to say that whrn i wore a white hat
ur literally the uncle Roger version of dirty jobs almost
the fact that this has been an ongoing series with this jimmy guy has cracked me up from a distance for so long. thank you unc roj
Uncle Roger looks like Zach king in that dress
jami oliver sucks
maybe chili jam isn't that bad lol their marketing team definitely deserves a raise!
Wait... that Guy is called Guy ? Poor guy...
Uncle roger you are so weak～～you can’t left a sugar so weak~~~ that’s why auntie Estern left you
When he wear that orange jacket he looked like a Chinese construction worker
Classic
Jamie versus trash trash would win because he is trash
2 years already ?!? Time runs fast...
I sorry, does uncle Rodger had a twin this entire time
5:18 Why so weak? So weak.
going to buy chilli jam fuyioooh
Not gonna lie, that dip with chili jam and cream cheese looks goooooooodd😋
You haven't seen anything squirting for while due to your excessive consumption of m.s.g.   M.s.g. is detrimental to your reproductive organs. Hence the departure of auntie Helen.
Yep, and now I want to buy it . Mission accomplished . Smaaaart )
Uncle roger, I have bad news.. I found a Jamie Oliver cooking book in a store..
That CEO is what all bosses should be.
That's awesome that they weren't super uptight about this.  Great video because they just rolled with it.
Fush
i guess uncle roger is really a different person from nigel ng
Up front everyone in the UK does not "love" Jamie Oliver XD XD XD my generation hate him BRING BACK OLD SCHOOL TURKEY TWIZZLERS! (the new ones are naff) Keep roasting Jamie Oliver you'll keep my whole generation supporting you XD XD XD
Uncle Roger you also put my feet up on the chair
Bro where india where india 😢
Whoever got uncle Rodger to tour this factory they need a raise. I bet they sold even more jars of chili jam cuz of uncle Rodger and no cuz of Jaime Oliver. Even tho he said he likes Jaime Oliver I bet he switched over and is a bigger fan of uncle Rodger cuz of how much uncle Rodger helped the company after this video lol 😂😂
My name guy
but dont give the recipe away   the video:
I lost count, we put them in here got me dying 💀
Jamie Oliver is very nice in person
Why so weak so weak haiiya-          uncle roger😂
I heard chili is flamable, just saying
I haven't seen the weejio yet.   But the title alone is enough 😂
bros white and says he black
I grew up in Seee in maylay in kk right now
All you twins look alike;]😊
white powder
this channel's got comedy and cooking married together i'd say
i love how clean that factory is, you would not belive the absolute RANK state of so many of these food factories.
What about Albenia?
Daddy Roger 😍😍
Nigel, you have so sweet teeth (11:33)❤
love this Guy, hahahah
Unapropiate comments to CEO…
Twins ?
Uncle Roger! Why so weak? You can barely lift the buckets. You had to get help from creepy assistant.
The CEO i want to be one day
Perfect condiment for EFR
Uncle Roger goes to guys grocery ❤
Your going to Bankok?! Bro i live there, But i cant go...
" Don't give the recipe away! " Uncle Roger with over 5 million views ✨
I yet have to see a maker of hot sauce not loving the job.
having Uncle Roger wearing that jacket is trolling level over 9000.
"Just imagine Auntie helen's in there"
PLEASE DO A BREAKING BAD MAKING BLUE MSG 99.9% PURITY- FUIYOOHHH
I can't really see many applications that I'd use Chili Jam for. It's one of those questions of, "why use it over chili oil or chili paste?" Toast? There's a hundred other things I'd rather put on toast though.
😮
I saw the thumbnail and you remind me of Jamie Oliver, Hiyyaaaa….😞
Jamie Oliver's dream
Now he said like collect motor bike for like new job my dad have a Honda nx5 grand pre motorbike which that bike is actually mine and it race bike it official bike it amazing
And ty mean thank you
The man in factory that with uncle roger he said he go to Thailand and Bangkok well my mom from Thailand and I went to Bangkok in Thailand my mom speak Thai I love this video Ty for saying the word Thailand you might think I crazy but it really mean a lot to me!
I’m in Bangkok Thailand
HES GOING TO BANGKOK???????
What? he has a twin???
I will bring MSG😂
rofl the CEO whipped out some egg fried rice lol
I always ask myself what the other ppl are thinking when Nigel stops speaking "proper" english and goes full on Unkoo Rogia xD
Soooooooo did u also hate rice since he also used it in the same dish too
It looks like that's actually Nigel laughing at the thought of Jamie Oliver's green curry tasting good.
Actually, those steam pots are the same type you find aboard cruise ships. No fire hazard.
The boss seems to be pretty cool ! Nice video and looks like some great Jams !!
Uncle Roger do you have a twin that is Nigel?
Dei pee da
This episode was SO cool! I can see Uncle Roger doing a complete season of "Dirty Jobs" but in Uncle Roger style. The CEO was so fun to watch and listen to too. Love it! 🙌
You should've got some chili for Jamie
This man fired him up with the, "think of it like it's Auntie Helen" ☠️
Aunty Helen: Uncle Roger cannot lifting the inggrediens ... so weak ... so weak 😂😂
Uncle Roger looks 70% white 😅
Any tickets in myanmar
Are they twins?
Wait I thought there the same person
Why not Hong Kong haiiiia
Uncle Roger please stop teasing children the wrong way it’s not appropriate kind sir!
He missed the chance to call himself breaking chilli 💀
Haiyaaa love your rice cooker
I like MSG
How it’s made
Uncle Roger will always be above Jamie Oliver.  Jamie Oliver didnt even promote the company or so far I know. Uncle Roger and this CEO are the G!
Probably my favorite episode of Uncle Roger.  The chili jam CEO reminds me of the evil protagonist from Despicable Me.  Has such a charming persona and air 😂
pretty good editing! almost perfect doppelganger. Fuiyohh
Totally gonna buy some. Top review on Amazon blames Uncle Roger for the purchase, lmao
Of course. Because MSG isn't natural.
Now I really wanna taste C. Jam.
Legit gonna order this.  How nice 😊
Chilli jam in egg fried rice actually makes a lot of sense.   Its savoury, has a good bit of heat but also adds sweetness and tartness, which is a perfect away to cut through and add a bit of freshness/sharpness that egg fried rice really needs.   Used this way, its not an alternative for Asian style chilli sauces - but would serve a function closer to ingredients like green onions or (in the case of Nasi Goreng) lime juice used to cut through some of the richness of egg fried rice.
man this nephew guy is underratedly hilarious😆😆
Haiya I'm already in kloe haiiiiyaaaaa
Why you have trouble lifting buckets?  Why so weak?  So weak.  Haiyah.
When you visit me on North Korea?
I died laughing just reading the video title 😅😅😅 auntie Hellen arranged another torture for our beloved uncle, hayyia!!
Really went down the rabbit hole over this chili jam 😂😂
Had to pause weejo several times, was laughing so much
funny that the englishman is subtitled, but uncle rogrog, we understand.
Why this CEO feels like a white version of Shaq, he's also quite big.
Are you going to australia?
He shouldn’t  be putting his hands into the spices 😬😬😬 I wonder if they change the whole box
Guess this is his payment for all the shit hes giving for Chilli Jam lol
You guys never come to Bangladesh
Guy: why don't you imagine its auntie helen in there?  Uncle Rodger : *suddenly has so much more strength*
CEO “Don’t give him the secret recipe”  Uncle Roger: Starts to name all the ingredients while putting them in.
I want to try chili 🌶️ jam now… I can’t help but think of Kinky Boots w: this factory!
nah uncle roger looks like a 70yr old karate master
bro 0:30 is trippy
Uncle Roger worked on your arm strength since the divorce but still so weak 😂
That dude was actually really cool for letting him come and talk to him and his company like that and laugh at it. Most companies would say no, absolutely not. Nice job nephew tracklements, nice job uncle Rodger
I never thought uncle Roger would visit Chili jam factory
Jason must have a stong core from the looks of the buckets.
after seeing this weejio i am very angry at Jamie Olive Oil for tarnishing the reputation of this wonderful chili jam company.
Great move going to the factory. UR may have hurt their sales, this will bring them to previous levels at least, IF sales had fallen.
uncle roger has a twin?????
This factory own by jamie oliver
There has never been a nicer mean person than Uncle Roger. I mean, he just roasts everyone, but you know he’s so nice. I think that it was great that you did a collaboration with Tracklements. Everyone was so good natured. Next, collaboration with JO himself!
I, unironically, want to try their sauces after this. Even the chili jam is starting to sound enticing.
If this youtube thing fails he can always make it as a warehouse manager, he's got the look down. All he needs is a plastic container full of noodles and vegetables.
He needs to invent chilli msg not that Jamie Oliver rubbish haiyah
CEO and team played this amazingly. their sales probably saw a dip after Nigel's review vid, and I guarantee its gonna see a spike now... really funny CEO, shows care for his product, and that its not just jamie oliver bs
Chili jam a condiment…….
you got ignored 5:27
is uncle roger and nigel the same person or?
please come to surabaya in indonesia  I and many others want to meet u
MSG is a natural product its funny ppl still dont know a shit about it
It could go on a shirt : "Whatever your question is, cool, but I love SAUCE !" I know I'd buy it :D
The old Chilli Jam Man ist more savage than your usual Hosts(Victims).
I dont understand about this chili jam cant go with fried rice. We  Indonesian use chili and tomato sauce sometime when we cook nasi goreng / fried rice
Jamie oliver HAIYAAAA❤
Jamie Oliver maybe shit, but chilli jam is🔥
MY DAD POR  SOY SUSE IN FRED RICE! >:(
DO YOU POR SOY SUSE
instead of "No n0 I dO it MYself say: "I aint a kiddo mister"  >=]
im ok if you cant:)
Can you visit manila next in ph because that where I live
haiyaaaaaa no manila tour!!!! y no manila huh uncle roger! huh!?
5:18 why so weak? Why so weak
Burn it down
uncle roger, you should team with jame oliver and make propper egg fried rice!
I hope it all goes well!
The big guy is like the Walter Bishop of Chilli Jams!!
I cooked better than J Oliver when I was 5 yrs old here in Italy! ahahahah
I do chilli jam myself, in Italy we eat that with like seasoned stinking cheese or similar! ;)
bro whos gonna read all that on 0:00 cc has to be on 🥲
Whili jam
‘So why don’t you imagine it’s auntie Helen in there?’  Uncle Roger goes X games mode 😂😂😂
Uncle Roger I am not trying to insult you but you should lift some weights to get muscle 💪
Pretty late to comment. But you need to observe proper wearing of hairnets when entering a factory be it an employee or visitor. Just like the worker at 7:48. Her hairnet covers the whole of her ears.  Apart from hair, ear wax and other ear stuffs could drop on the food and can cause cross contamination.    You should also need to observe proper attire (wearing lab coats, indoor shoes/slashers).   They also didn't wear face masks in the cooking area. Some -spit- mouth droplets may get in the jam, especially when you are talking.   At 7:56 an employee on the right is wearing shorts?  Haiyaaa. You should always wear pants/slacks. And the left employee had her hair neatly tied, but no hairnet? Haiyaaa  1:55 bro I'm Asian but I think Lab coats and haircaps are cool asf 😂. Am I the only one on this?   I do agree tho that  safety vest on a labcoat is too over the top. I imagine it was very hot wearinh it 😆
i live in lampang, thailand
I like how unbothered nephew CEO is when Uncle Roger says Nike might sue.. "yeah, I guess" 😂  Maen, I want to be this chill
Now i feel like i need uncle roger to react to breaking bad. "This meth blue.. okay.. but no MSG. Hayyiiaaa... so weak! Heisenbeeeerg.. what are you doing??"
No Jamie Oliver was harmed.
Uncle roger why so weak why so weak ?
10:33 "I call it instashit"  , is this british uncle roger? 😂
This is funny
Really smart CEO, he knew he needed to do some damage control, because their product was judged without even trying it. Now if it’s good or not is another matter, but know people know the brand.
Why you not go to Manila?? why?? why?? so weak. so weak. smh
Good to Beirut  in lebanon 🌏 ❤
I'm not gonna lie but I like to put chilli jam in my bread
Uncle Roger what was that with the sugar??? Soo Weak!
Laughed out loud at the high viz vest 🤣
Now we love tracklements because this video😂
Rubbish sauce.if you can't handle chili, stay in caves. Don't add so much sugar n vinegar. That's not chili sauce...
Absolutely wonderful, and Mr Guy of TRacklements is charming.    NIgel you are a naughty man sometimes.
Bro where's Nigeria?
haha reminds me of the show "how its made" but with even better humor
I laughed for 3 minutes straight for the orange vest. Respect for Uncle Rogers for being a man of principles.
YOU WERE MENT TO DESTROY THE SITH NOT JOIN THEM
"Nephew Guy" made me think he kept forgetting his name... but his name is Guy >.>;
Uncle Roger so weak! Can't carry sugar or stir sauce
"So why dont you imagine auntie helen is in there"   It got me laughing
Uncle Roger like a spoilt kid one so much complain hard work lor.😮
Uncle Guy is the best
Uncle Roger couldn’t lift or stir the ingredients … so weak, SO WEAK.  Maybe that’s why Auntie Helen left.
I think uncle roger has a twin idk
Why you don’t visit MSG factory 😊
Uncle Roger Calling everyone weak when he so weak he couldnt even lift up 1 pound of an ingredient
Uncle MSG vs Uncle chilli jam
I’m just imagining his intrusive thoughts. He was probably like “FERB GET THE BOMB” 💀
lol to be fare that was a hell of a lot of spice
If great great grand nephew Jamie Oliver went to this factory he'd start swimming in the jam.
OK this was a great weejio
Uncle greg know make chili sounce with fish sounce
The thiland chili's is nam pok
I love sounce uncle roger
The factory is good uncle roger
Love the passion and love the CEO and his crew have for the food they make. Huge respect.
enjoyed this SO MUCH !!!    期待你 “回家" ~
I think the boss is a serious man, but he acted crazy guy.
Uncle Roger no come to India..haaiyaa
着迷罗杰叔叔的声音
Come to Hong Kong laaaaa many fan waiting for your egg fry rice show 😂😂😂
Uncle  j missed out on teaming Jamie  oliver
haiyaa can't even lift the bucket WHY SO WEAK SO WEA????
uncle Rodger is becoming Jamie Olivers fukboy,,,,,, chilli jam hiyah
I watched this a month ago. I ordered a jar of the Tracklement chilli jam.  I have a teaspoon left, it's awesome. Amazing glaze for BBQ meat.
Where can we buy the chilli jem?
Finally someone who matches Uncle Roger's energy at one of the places he visits lol
hmmm ... yeah .... id like to touch nigella too ... XD
sus
chillll
Haha, he does the Cantonese accent with a Brit accent. lol.
awesome
"Who buy so many chilli jam?" - Jamie Oliver's fans!
I can't find chilli jam in my country 😂
haiyaa factory
uncle roger - Too Weak - can't lift sugar
Wish more CEOs were like this guy
Pretty sure this ole Thai loving pērv can land the title of "Uncle" since he's twice your age and gets twice your Viagra script amount.
Yeah, the CEO wasnt traveling the Thai Trail of Tail for "Jam"... Edit: look at the black circles under his eyes and you already know he's a pred.
No one ever tell the CEO that MSG is natural?
Company name really is wack...
Dude you gotta stop cracking on Jamie, he's British. You already know he cant cook.
That CEO looks pretty square, but turns out he gets it.
What an absolute legend. I reckon workers at Tracklements are a happy mob with a CEO like that
The CEO is definitely a better sport than Jamie Oliver.
The Chilli Jam industry was in a panic because Uncle Roger was causing their stock to collapse, so they had to take evasive action.
6:25 had me in tears 😂😂😂
Imagine how much reputation damage Jamie Oliver has done to warrant this collab 🤣
Hello uncle roger 👋 i love your videos their funny😂...and i have a question ⁉️ are you nephew nigel twins cause you two look alike 😮,
Haiyaaaaaaaaaaa you visit every place but Indonesia Gordon Ramsay of course go to Indonesia more times than you.
take msg wherever i damn well please, lookin at you fda
Two rogers twins
Amazing CEO Cool vibes, I also think uncle roger got owned on this one😂😂😂
Look at the CEO's hand size... Between that and his demeanor, I get bareknuckle boxer vibes from him...
Come to Bangkok, I will help you find your lost Mom in Chilli farm. 😂
Chili jam sandwich not bad
I feel like uncle Roger can't speak Chinese and is just being racist.
Lol of course he puts on an orange safety vest
Love how the owner can take jokes and is well known for aunt helen :D
Nobody, uncle roger be like: ThIs ToO mUcH, jAsOn HeLp! Im dying🤣
Title: The Unappealing Aspects of Bland Chilli Jam  Introduction: Chilli jam, a condiment that combines the sweet and spicy flavors of chili peppers and sugar, has gained popularity in recent years. However, it is important to acknowledge that culinary experiences can differ greatly. In this essay, we will explore the reasons why some individuals might find bland chilli jam unappealing, considering its lack of flavor, limited culinary compatibility, potential health concerns, and impact on certain cuisines.  Lack of Flavor: One of the primary reasons why some people find bland chilli jam unappealing is its lack of flavor. While it may offer a hint of sweetness, the absence of a robust and well-balanced taste can make it unexciting and underwhelming. The absence of the desired spiciness in chilli jam can fail to deliver the expected sensory experience, leaving individuals dissatisfied and searching for alternative condiments that offer more flavor complexity.  Limited Culinary Compatibility: Bland chilli jam's lack of distinct flavor can limit its compatibility with various dishes. Unlike its spicier counterparts, it may struggle to enhance the taste of savory foods or create a harmonious flavor combination. This lack of versatility can restrict its usage in different cuisines and render it less desirable for those seeking a condiment that adds depth and character to a broader range of dishes. Consequently, individuals may opt for condiments that can better complement and elevate the flavors of their meals.  Potential Underlying Health Concerns: Another aspect that may contribute to the negative perception of bland chilli jam is the potential underlying health concerns associated with its consumption. Although it may appear less intimidating to those who are averse to spiciness, the high sugar content in sweet chilli jam can be a cause for concern. Excessive consumption of sugary condiments can contribute to various health issues, such as obesity, diabetes, and dental problems. Thus, individuals may opt for healthier alternatives or reduce their overall intake of sweet condiments.  Cultural Considerations: Cultural preferences and culinary traditions also play a significant role in shaping one's culinary experiences. In some cuisines that prioritize bold and flavorful tastes, the lack of flavor in bland chilli jam may not align with the traditional culinary practices. The absence of a distinctive taste may be perceived as insipid or lacking authenticity, leading to a diminished appreciation for bland chilli jam in certain culinary contexts.  Conclusion: While chilli jam has gained popularity for its unique sweet and spicy combination, the lack of flavor in bland chilli jam can be unappealing to some individuals. Its limited culinary compatibility, potential health concerns associated with its sugar content, and cultural considerations further contribute to its negative perception. Personal preferences and tastes in food vary greatly, and it is crucial to recognize and respect the diverse range of opinions when it comes to condiment choices. Exploring alternative condiments that offer more flavor complexity may better suit individual palates and enhance culinary experiences.
Uncle Roger couldnt even lift the sugar haiiyaaaah why uncle Roger so weak? So weak
Wow English chilli. Where is the sun to make the capsicums
Going bald
2:14 This set looks so cute on Uncle Roger :)))))
Delhi?
CEO just smiling while uncle roger just insulting his company
Uncle Rodger needs to work out a little bit more.💪 I love when he talks with out the exaggerated accent.
Traklemens stonks after the release of this video 📈📈📈
Former P&G employee here, Uncle Roger really knows how to speedrun health and safety violations. FDA would be absolutely furious with him for touching raw ingredients with his bare hands
I'm surprised you didn't see Jamie Oliver there 💀😭
WHY Just white and  asain What about  Africa
that was the most chill CEO
I hope you go to MSG factory
this english guy is so english that he hides all emotion untill camera drops 😂
Fair play to them allowing Roger in for that skit knowing that he's there to take the piss....just missed one major    thing to make the video perfect...a visit from Jamie to purchase a tray of jam
7:12 AYO-
Some person unknowingly got chili jam made by uncle Roger. Holy shit the irony is actually palpable
Good job, Uncle Roger.  With you, nobody is safe but they are perfectly safe at the same time.  TOUGH LOVE FTW!!!!!
The guy leading the tour has a really good sense of humor too!
Proper bloke innit
😂😂😂
The guy came prepared with the egg fried rice 😂

Jamie Oliver lives here!
This was awesome. 👏🏽 😎
Good that they are wearing hair nets.   But why are they not wearing masks while pouring stuff into the mixer, especially since they are talking to each other? 🤦🏻
Send it to srilanka
This ceo is a vibe
Thus too funny, chilli jam factory Jaime oliverr

Its not nam prik
Love the Borat vibe!
bruh when he said "so why dont you imagine it's auntie helen in their" and uncle roger said "uncle suddenly have so much strength" it got me so good i wanted to say he is a simp XD
When adding chili jam to egg fried rice use the right amount not the white amount  The white amount is 1 teaspoon, the right amount is throwing it to the trash
hes trying so hard not to insult guy
2:01 in America when people where white hats when they kill black people
Good chilli jam is so nice especially with some strong cheese
i never knew about chilli jam until the Jamie Olive Oil's egg fried rice episode where you review his video, after watching this, i will be picking some of the hot sauce to try. the owner is funny and i respect how he gave you a tour and let you help make a batch!
Please may have visit in India😢😅
HAAIYAAAAA WHY NO INDIA SHOW
can uncle roger and nepwhew nigel be in same room
British fried rice is Fried rice with chili jam
5:16 So Weak Sooo Weak
《guy》
And remember kids " vegetable taste like sad"-
Wait. Is uncle roger and Nephew Nigel different people??
Chilli jam. Also known as the devils nut.
Good sports about it.
He said don't give the recipe away but here is uncle Roger giving it away in the media yeah media in the yt community 😂😂😂❤ h HAIYYAA but fuiyooohhh at the same time because uncle Roger in it ❤❤
5:18  Why so weak??
If you knock Uncle Roger into a vat of the stuff, he’d go down like the Terminator but Thumb Down
This CEO gives me overweight Marlon Brandon Godfather vibes, I approve.
Collects motorbikes eh? What a guy!
Jason must be JACKED under that coat.
WHA HE HAS A TWINN FIAOCOSJFKWJ DC 😱😭
I like how he refers to a much older guy as nepwhew. XD
Uncle Roger week like his ex bitch foyooo
Excellent!!!
Best marketing strategy of the century.
Uncle Roger can't even lift up bucket without white man help.  So weak! So weak!
Don’t give the recipe away! Also Uncle Roger: **makes a video**
When security confiscates drugs, they usually try them out. I imagine theres more than one security guard who snorted MSG, then yelled and threw it away.
So cool and funny. From BBC news, mei mei, food truck, and up to here, Chilli Jam. 😂😂🤣 Too many opportunities and fun for more laughter and interest trying new products that Uncle Roger tried. 😂😂🤣
Fuiyoh, now visit msg factory
0:07 is the funniest parts
Bankok! He will visit me!
Uncle Roger is so fking WEAK! 🤣🤣🤣

Says don’t tell the recipe then uncle roger casually tells the recipe
Do you have this product in Sweden ? I really want It
Whats with all the white jokes you don't look like you seen the sun in 20 years yourself 👋
Guy needs to talk to HR
This man definitely did some research on Uncle Roger, whether he's an active viewer or not I'm not sure but he knew about Auntie Helen and tha's already more than I was expecting
we will teach you the secret recipe don't give it to anyone  uncle roger: *mention all the ingredient so loud*
like bbc
The guy give rice to uncle Roger he thinks that uncle Roger will like eating it 😮 camera man have to walk backwards 😂😂
Come back to Malaysia haiya

The CEO even Heard of Aunty Helen 🤔😅
I spit M&Ms all over my screen when he said “sent to HR for doing weird shit to your chili jam!”
his name is guy bruh his parents are weird
I have to check this out thanks for making this
his name is just Guy
As usual I wasn't disappointed. Good job Uncle Roger .
But why mesh Trilby?
Why so week  Why so week 😂😂
So chilli jam is a white version of less spicy thai sweet chilli paste.
Brilliant 👏  you both slayed it. "Nephew guy" is the king of marketing by far.
M’Lady-Hat finally at the factory💃🏼
Yeah ah. Uncle Roger have enough chilli jam to be abusive now
shoutout to the humble CEO

No Middle East countries for dat tour or just to scared huh scared of the war come to Qatar or Saudi

Uncle I am surprised you didn't simultaneously burst into flames at the sight of so much chilli jam
Nephew guy please export all tht products to Sabah, Malaysia please

Its so dangerous to your stomach,. You just drink hot tea maybe its make you to relax .. 😂😂😂😂
shit was funny about the first 10 times you watch it. then you just complain to complain and also its a character.
U are the same person
Jaime Oliver’s version of Breaking Bad
"hope they let me in and don't murder me" lmaoo this one caught me off guard with his delivery
Thats a great CEO, and a good comedian as well. I think Nigel broke character more often than he does.
Brilliant
Haiyaa
Wait uncle roger and nephew nigel are not the same person wtf
Uncle Roger you should go to msg factory please
Hats off to Tracklements for their sense of humor. I wonder if their business picked up after this video.
Tge ceo sounds like Bruce from finding Nemo
This "Guy" guy is so hilarious! I love the product simply by association!
4:16 the confidence to just whip out a sarcastic witty retort like that! That guy knows his way around humor!
That Guy guy is epic
So weak your brand name, I like it.
7:33 "it too fast, iT TOO FAST" HAHAHAHA the panic in uncle roger's voice 😭😭😭
nepew guy  looks like he didnt apeect it
Have u decided on the name for ur baby yeah guy
The Waffle House has found it’s new host.
Jamie Oliver more like Jam Olive Oil
can i have name of the song for descriptions
This is uncle Roger's worst nightmare
Haiyaaaaa no chili jam failure
5:17  So weak, so weak
Such a down to earth guy with some golden dry humor. I bet he's a good boss to work for.
If you have bloopers for a comedy video, are you so funny you make yourself laugh or are you so bad at being funny you have to retake a shot to make yourself funny?
Visiting chili jam factory 🤣🤣 this man is funny
I got the chills when he said “sorry children”🥲
HAYIAAAAAAA WHY CHILLI JAM
Their mustard ketchup is amazing with ham!
is it just me or is uncle rogers family a clone of him with a voice changer
Haha great this one. Nephew Guy understood the assignment. 😂
Fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh fuiyoh  hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya hayya

So weak, so weak
4:03 THIS guy is a great sport😂😂 Fuiyoooooh 👍
I stumbled upon these at Waitrose, this Xmas. A  tad pricey, but more than worth it. Absoloutely incredible. I have not stopped finding reasons to put it on stuff.
Lol they look same
超级赞
Infiltrating enemy lines
I’m glad uncle Roger went to the chili jam factory- Jamie Oliver gave it a bad rep 😏  No chili jam in fried rice ! Haiyaa
dont worry , we bring bring msg in little white baggie in pocket. roll up dolla bill  in bathroon when we see you. fuiyoh..
Chili Wonka's Emporium of Wonders reminds me of when I worked for P&G through a contractor. Only difference is that shampoo and bodywash are both scary, and mouthwash + toothpaste are both actually require toxic ingredients to produce. I was nearly unknowingly exposed to an alkylating agent in a pre-weigh position, as well as surfactants and fluoride salts. In A-Lab, Hexane, H2S, DCM, and Chlorobutanol were some of my best friends, as well as residues of Nitric acid and selenium
I just love how many things that Uncle Roger roasts tend to be good sports and plays along. Seriously props to them.
MEA
Chilli wonka no meat wonka
“FUYOHH” never gets old😂
Why they all look alike 😂
Ok but pepper jam is amazing mixed in burger meat tho
The problem is not with chili jam, which is actually a very nice condiment for certain things. It's how Oliver used it in that horrific display of fried rice. It's like how guacamole is good, but if you scoop it into your fried rice, you're just destroying the dish.
While you can't bring MSG to his shows, you can bring it to an airport so be sure to travel with as much as possible.
Australia?!
Nigel looks like an uncle roger edited on without the accent
Now we know chili jam is a CONDIMENT at the same par as Ketchup and Salad Dressing. Great for making vegetables less sad, not great with rice.
U 2 are copy paste 😂
That dude is awesome!
burn it down
Can’t wait for the show
u kill people then u kill people
dont give the recipe away   the people wathing the video seeing how they make it:
Aren’t you white
MSG is no less natural than most other condiments or ingredients. It's a salt found in tomatoes for example, and used to be obtained from vegetable proteins (old production method). Nowadays, it is produced by fermentation, similar to yoghurt. People can be so uneducated sometimes... MSG 4 life!
who does everyone who works with unlce roger look so pissed
*"Uncle Roger suddenly have so much strength"* What now-
Hj
i thought it whas 1 persson
Nigella is a goddess!
he sounds like shaq o neil haha
glitchy footage or is it my phone
CEO is so nice👍🏾 I wanna try the jam now
Uncle Roger finally met his match 🤣
srry children
Or as I like to call it, the lube factory
my cooking class followed a jamie oliver recipe once and someone it tasted like crap
for the people who dont know what MSG stands for: MSG = Make Shit Good
I’m Bangkok I live in bang cock
he just insulted the ceo
Tullberg is a Swedish name....😁😁
Jamie Oliveroil....
this is *guy*
5:15, why you so weak, SO WEAK
3:02 XD
''Hiyaa so weak your brand name'' Owner of tracklements: O_O
0:53 ok but are they wrong tho
I not going if they don’t allow msg
Uncle rogger looks like a health inspector
We call Instagram instashit but still use it... cuz money, good good
im confused so much ;-;
im confused why there 2 uncle roger
Hearing Twice made my day
GIANT!
Guess msg weigh less than sugar...so weak...so weak.
Haiyaa uncle roger can’t even stir the chilli So WeAk!
Culture Vultures Europeans! They literally stole everything in the world.
So did you sabotage? Uncle
imagine someone that has a BIG chilli jam factory and name is guy tullberg
So why dont you imagine aunty helen is in there?! HAHAHAHAH I loved this 😂
The pots look like gun pellets that are harmful
if he is the willy wonker of chilli jam then Jamy olliver must be the fat kid who fell in the choclat
No way dude he vist that factory
branding with insult.
From Nigel’s accent I assume he is a singaporean and don’t worry , I live in Singapore I know their accent
HAIYA Uncle Roger why so weak SO WEAK!
this is my first time seeing Uncle Roger and Nephew Nigel in one frame
In the first minute Uncle Roger starts insulting this giant. I wasn't sure he would survive.  But as the video progressed there was some good banter.
What a nightmare for uncle roger/mrnigelng
I love your channel uncle Rodger. Wayyyy cute, I'm happy auntie Helen isn't in the picture.  Lol ... love your humor!!!
haiya why chilli jam
You became the very thing you swore to destroy
Sorry children
Definitely one of best collabs I've seen Uncle Roger do.
Czemu każdy wygląda identycznie
I thought u died ur hair blue for a sec💀
Is this a series because I’m loving this. Meet the people behind the food we eat and learn how it’s made. The humour is always on point.
Stop complaining about your MSG haiyaa
The President of this company is a hell of a good sport! Good on them for inviting Uncle Roger to their factory. There is nothing wrong with their product, it is only the way clueless Oliver used it.
I thought i was gonna see chilli... all i see is shit
Ha ha! Visiting a chili jam factory. Just for the meme. Top quality 👌
Damn it now i wanna try some of their stuff, i wonder if they ship to the US.
Omgg laa u from kl too laa i come se ah
Seattle Neptune Theater in April!
why he look like zack king in the thumbnail
This is like a YouTube documentery but Asien 💀✨
WHERES HK
I want to see a video where uncle Roger does spice challenge
Mr. Tulberg is cool. He's probably got a bunch of motorcycles i dream of.
When he sayed "i just eating it" then you should have answer with "that what i did with auntie Esther" 🤣 or something like that
Jhjhjh
They gotta say they love Jamie Oliver. Why would they want to lose their biggest customer?
pov u found two ver of uncle rodger
i call it instashit  i like that guy lol
Hey chiccha come to India Hyderabad for comedy
Not all British people like Jamie Oliver. He’s embarrassing
i think Uncle Roger's roasting heat is too much for these dudes, leaving them speechless 😂
Why are you here?? THIS IS YOUR NIGHTMARE!!!!
YESS KL
I can’t even with the Jamie Oliver jokes
1:40 hella insulted that man’s brand name lmao 🤣
Honest factory, honest product.
Im buying.
The part where he said imagine auntie helen is there  Uncle roger:uncle roger sundenlly get more strengh
I have not tried Chilli Jam,  but I do have red pepper jam.  I like it on sandwiches.
I LOVE the owner of the company xD now I want to buy the chili jam.
Collect stamps. I was an avid Philatelist when I was a child, back in the late 80s and early 90s. I still have a pretty big collection of vintage postage stamps. Any stamp collectors out there? I wish that there was a cool way to display my collection. I have so many! They are like tiny pieces of art.
" its very difficult "  Owner : " So why don't you imagine Auntie Helen is in there? " "Uncle roger suddenly have so much strength "   Its so funny😂 especially Uncle roger's face when the owner said " so why dont you imagine auntie helen is in there ? "
🤣🤣😂😂
Bro Nigel editing skills are crazy I really thought Uncle Roger and Nigel were sitting next to each other I don't even see any background clipping or anything fuiyoh
Definitely have to try that chili jam with fried rice.
haiyaa uncle Roger you say you hate chili jam then you make chili jam why WHY haiyaa
I just wonder why until today jamie oliver doesn't response to all of uncle roger's trashing over him. He probably can sue uncle roger right? Maybe nephew nigel get a permission from him right? 🤣🤣🤣
'Worldwide tour' = everywhere but Africa
As a thai i felt cringe when 3:32 strikes 💀
It's hilarious watching Uncle Roger calling an obviously older gentleman "Nephew Guy"
Here in Texas, we serve jalapeno jelly over a brick of cream cheese and you can spread it on crackers. It is a great party food to set out.
Uncle roger u have become what u are fight against
This video was awesome but Im just sitting here in amazement marveling how advertisement and marketing has changed in the last decade. Now adays its not about TV and newspaper ads its real people showing things on their own accounts on social media and that's what drives people to buy things. Companies are giving a ton of free things to "influencers" for marketing. They're having to work harder (or be smarter) to stay relevant, but at the same time its easier bec the "influencer" is doing all the work for you and they're coming with their followers.  Just crazy how the game changed.  Chili Jam company is definitely smart!
When Uncle Roger comes to Netherlands?
Nephew Nigel said TOKYO!! Where is your Tokyo ticket link? Where your link? Haiyaaa…
i like how uncle roger and nigel  collab again
Uncle roger need a gym membership 🤣🤣
5:15 I instantly got diabetes from look at that
Wait..... are they both twins?
Uncle Roger why your arms SO WEAK??...
I think the CEO forgot how long they've been in business. I've heard "been around a long time" and "that's how long we've been doing it, for a number of years" 😅
This video shows that square middle aged men can also have a good sense of humor. Best regards, A square middle aged man.
Fuyoh
Fuyoh
Chilli jam🤣
Who cares how green the jelly factory is? Was it really necessary to say it the very first thing? What’s wrong with this world
The you make me feel special is the uncle roger rickroll
Uncle Roger is so cute in this, he looks like a little kid. 🤣
As a Thai I never seen chili jam on my country just seen chili sauce
i didnt know uncle roger and uncle nigel were twins ! :o
3:32 Bangkok and Thailand? What?????
I love this guy 🤣his so funny
5:18 why so weak, WHY SO WEAK?!
bro got humiliated straight away💀
maybe jason should share his workout routine with uncle roger, really putting the spice in that chili jam
Sounds like one of the voice actors off of Witcher 3
this is so funny alone but it’s also hilarious when you realize this is just an ad for chili jam
ceo: don’t give the recipe away uncle roger: instructions unclear, 4 million people know now
i like to go bang kok
Uncle Roger made me hate chilli jam so much. But now, this wejio made me want to try some.  The marketing strategy is astounding.
TRAITOR
Can't believe that's the CEO.. do you bring him a script and a list of a couple videos to watch of yours? or did he do his own research because this is extremely well done. Why no link to their website in description Haiyaaa!
Dude calls instagram instashit? I'm in
哀呀🤣🤣🤣🤣👍👍👍👍👏👏👏
that tracklements CEO is fucking legendary.
this guy is lituarily the white shaq listen to him and hes big too
Now this British chili jam gained world exposure and I wonder how it tastes like.
chilli jam factory haiyaaa or fuiyoh? in the comments
5:16 why so weak? Why so weak? Haiyaaaaaa
If i was Jason i would have said "Why so weak? Why so weak?"
The first thing I thought of when I saw the title was Jamie Olive Oil
Dont they mean chutney instead of chili jam???
The orange safety vest!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Love it!!
hwo to make nikacado avocado fatter
Uncle roger look so short 😂😂
5:25 jason dint give uncle roger the paddl
Good sport!
oi uncle did you got sued by them or black mailed?
Damn somebody skipped gym day.
ok i gonna try to buy a trackleman chilli jam to try out and see! The man seem to be a nice guy
Uncle Roger more cool.
I would have it with out sugar you know like just chill sauce. Like chatni
Idk about you, but it really looks like your typical thai sweet chili sauce but a bit more thick/gelatinous 🤷‍♂️
Why didn't wear mask while talking and pouring ingredients into container??
id love chili jam or chili sauce on my fried rice but only for the last thing to add, not something you cook with
Where’s the failure (Steven he)
They should make a limited edition of “Uncle Rogers fried rice sauce” 😁
“How many children disappeared in your factory?” “I’ve lost count we just put them in there”
3:33 living in Thailand more than 20 years, i have never heard of that chili jam ;(
Damn! Now I have to go and buy some chilli jam.
Whatever they're doing, it's working. The chili jam is actually great with grilled chicken skewers.
Shabu
Whoever likes Jamie Oliver means that those person have not taste at all in their taste buds n in their lives. #Blend  life
lol taste of revenge
Jason face when uncle roger drink that chili jam 🤣🤣🤣 6:42
Based CEO
man, uncle roger and nigel look so nice, lookin almost like twins
Great and very funny advertisement. But the real winner as always Chilli Jam Oliver. Its like a one sided Jimmy Kimmel vs Matt Damon
WHERE DENPASAR I WANNA SEE DENPASAR
"So weak your branding" bruh uncle rogers got balls of steel😂
Bro funny 😂
Uncle Roger needs to visit the gym - haiyaa!
Don’t knock it till you try it hahahaa
“Cider vinegar” :/
0:52 Do these two look almost exactly the same, or am I just racist?
Haha, first time working in your life ^^
5:16  Why so weak so weak
"just imagine it's auntie Helen in there" Uncle Roger suddenly have, so, much, strength 😂
i wonder how much cash Uncle roger got from this chillie jam advertisement xD. now i want to buy Tracklements chillie xx
Legit going to try chilli jam + cream cheese on bread/toast
So wek
Nephew Guy is the hero we need!
I have more respect for chili jam now.  Doesn't seem that different from a Lao Gan Ma product.
In your opinion what goes well with this chilli jam?
Uncle Rodger was getting paid!  Great Ads for the company though.
Uncle Roger so weak~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SORRY CHILDREN!!!!!!!!!!
Fun fact: Uncle Roger and Nephew Nigel look very identical, other than their wardrobe.
western style chilli jam is truely disgusting ... but korean or thai style is good
jamie oliver spicy poop jam factory
Uncle bojer can i eat 辣椒 pls
uncle roger so WEAK, SO WEAK
hahahaha love the Ceo is down to earth on this one
Love this video
What did it taste like? What do they reccomend putting it on? Looks like making Howard's hot pepper relish? Lol
Jamie Oliver once again uniting people in their mutual hate for him. Not sure why people are so mad about the company, I doubt they make their sales off people putting it in egg fried rice and there's nothing really wrong with chili jam as long as you don't claim it to be asian, let alone an ingredient for authentic asian recipes.  Probably the same haters that blame Clorox because some idiots claim bleach enemas will fix autism.
Haiyaa
*when your in the Philippines:*
I love uncle Roger accent lol 😂
CHILI WONKA
Cool Guy, this guy.
Urge to buy chili jam…. Rising….
He TALKS to his jars?! 😍💜! Ok, if I ever get to go to the UK, I'm getting some chilli jam!

It make more sense if you try to destroy the factory
This guy was trying to stay so professional... Don't know how he did it with uncle Rodger, he can make me laugh any time, any day 😂🙏
This video reminds me of Mr. Rogers when he would tour work places. You should do a parody video of Mr. Rogers Neighborhood.
cant lift bucket ‘so weak, so weak
Come to india too 😿
What an owner. Legend.
this is the first time that i cried laughing, this is too wholesome and funny😭😭
"This too much... Jason, help" 🤣
The people who take this all in fun are the people I like. Never would have bought something like this before but now I will buy at least 1 jar for this CEOs great attitude.
wtf even is "chili jam"
Whoever got that batch of chili jam, yours was blessed by uncle Rodger
That guy kind of looks like Skyler Gisondo, the kid from santa clarita diet
I like when companies can take a joke.
This guy tricked me into buying his jam with his personality
Look, it hell
For some reason I thought that uncle Roger and Nephew Nigel were the same person
Those jars that Uncle Roger leaned on can sell for extra bucks 😂
Yeaa uncle jam
Uncle Roger might need to spend mor time at the gym. So sad.
I can sue chillies jam for not using gloves
Uncle Roger not able to pour in the sugar or stir tge mix...........WHY SI WEAK???😂
I think uncle Roger and Nigel looks the same
Soup
CEO sounds like Idris Elba 🤣
Now I want to try the chili fish sauce. I m from Vancouver Canada.
this is the best laugh i have had in a very long time.  ThinkPad thanks you Uncle Roger
Pretend Auntie Hellen is in there Uncle Roger: … UNCLE ROGER SUDDENLY HAVE SO MUCH STRENGTH
Uncle roger: BURN IN HELL CHILLI JAM YOU USELESS SHIT
Uncle roger even has his hands behind his back when touring the place, a true malaysian uncle
Uncle Roger said the jam taste like Revenge, i don't know what it means but i want to try it
Why don't you get to Hanoi ...
Love the owner's sense of humour and high tolerance towards uncle Roger's sarcastic comments. Not many white people are like that when interacting with the minority groups
3:03 sorry children
Can u do tour in VN?
i just realised nigel ng and u are twins?
KL?
UNCLE ROGER, HOPE TO SEE YOU ALSO HERE IN PHILIPPINES AND TRY TO VISIT ALSO  THE  " WISH BUS "
Jamie Olive oil would be proud
Such a hilarious video, Guy was a great sport.
Please visit the Philippines!
W nephew guy
Good Good , nephew Nigel said KL but not Kuala Lumpur! Very Malaysian!
"Jason HELP" 😂😂
I approve.
This owner knows what he's doing. He won everything out of bad situation.
As a wise man once said *It is not the chilli jam's fault, Jamie is just using it for the wrong purposes*
Great video! Huge fun, handsome Nigel, and a good advert for Tracklement - I shall certainly be trying them out! :)
Chilli jaaaaaaaam
Am I the only Chinese, Asia born and raised person who thinks chilli jam would actually be nice in egg fried rice? (As a condiment not mixed in during cooking ofc)  It reminds me of sweet chili sauce Sweet chilli sauce tastes great with fried rice
There are 2rogers
THE EGG FRIED RICE OMG 😭😭😭😭😭
“Im sure his green curry tastes good”  *chuckle*
U have a twin?
.
This is the nicest guy ever, would love to try his products just for how passionate he actually is.
For youuuuu
So weak
he kinda looks like Zach king in the thumbnail              *also how tf is there 2 of them?*
Visit india
Uncle roger I'm from Malaysia
Dont tell anyone the recipe ............ Now over 3,500,000 people know the the recipe
"This is your outfit dont blame me" lmao had me dead.
"I like Nigella, she is on cocaine, but still a nice person" :-)
Uncle Roger and nephew Nigel Is same person
Brilliant episode <3
6:31 FUIYOOOOH FEEL THE POWER
Guy so nice boss, let me work for u
before the review with Jamie Olive(r)-oil  i didnt know chilli jam was a thing , i guess its not commun or popular in canada ( or at least where i live ) and i wouldnt use it over real chilli and fresh ingrediant for cooking but as a dip/condiment for cracker , bread etc it does look good
hi uncle Roger.  I just watched your visit to the chilli jam factory.  you needed help from Jason to lift the sugar: you so weak!
Gotta love the brits prefer them over americans any day they atleast are gentle people
That’s so funny;)))
I like M.S.G.
5:25 disgusting, if this was a brewery you get fired on the spot.
Are nephew Nigel and uncle Roger twins?
Why is half the things you say racist?
I thought it was Child jam
Uncle Roger roasting the CEO of tracklements in front of him
I liked Tracklements stuff before I saw this (Fig relish!) now I like them even more
Why you don't like your nieces and nephews in Canada uncle roger... You keep postponing your shows here. Haiyaa!!! Auntie Helen take all your money ..
This was great!  Kudos to the owner for being such a great sport and having a great sense of humor.  What a collaboration!  I'm not in the UK but if I see Tracklement's brand in the future I will be sure to give it a try.
Bengkok:bent
5:18 "Jason help" Jason: why u so weak? xD
I like this guy, he's absolutely on board for what's going on.
Theres 2 of them??!
Jason strong 💪 haiyaa
No INDIA?
The orange jacket over the lab coat is so funny
idk why but at the start when i saw the both of them scares me because they are almost  the same person
that lady shaking her head while packing :)
Uncle Roger: Jayson help!🥲 5:17
My first attempt at making fried rice: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2Oc4xq_TbQ&t=8s&ab_channel=LeoCooksThings
Instashit.... 😂😂😂
7:15 Uncle Roger be sussy
kind of refreshing to see someone laughing at uncle roger. I know he's funny but it's different when we see it.
0:40 honestly they could be different people or the same and I couldn't tell. those sorts all look the same.
Why you no plant Nigella seeds and grow more Nigella lawsons?
Good marketing
I haven't seen the comment yet but I'm still surprised no one's commented on the fact that there's two of them. Are they twins or they're the same person with filming magic? I thought, Uncle Roger was Mr. Nigel
Imagine Auntie Helen’s in their  Have a taste Taste like revenge  😂😂😂
Uncle roger is real?
Ceo seems like he should be uncle not nephew, he's got uncle energy 😂😂😂
OK... what's KL???
Uncle roger has betrayed us
The ceo looks dumbfounded to uncle rogers jokes
Come to Ireland or I'll never eat MSG again !
Try with pork.
Hi to msg factory
"got nice kick to it" proceeds to punch
Now I'm ready to try 😛
Aaahhahahaayaaa so weak 🤣
This factory is so close to where I grew up. Good Westcountry sense of humour from the CEO 😂
Why not they wearing mask?
Omg I laughed so hard at the end at the Nike joke.
The owner is super chill didn’t expect that
6:38 anyone please put uncle Sally from upin & ipin here
"You kill people, you kill people" -uncle roger
When he said "Sorry children" he sounded like an American.
great  shop     i  likely  would  prefer  the  no-sugar   products.    or  just  a  pinch  per  jar...
Uncle Roger came in with hot fire and nephew guy took the burns like a champ
chili wonka
hiya only white people country
Have you ever got a stand-up at Philippines Uncle Roger?
OMGGG uncle rogerr and nephew nigel looks so alike omygaddd 😱 HAHAHAHAHAA
I went from not caring about this jam but after watching this, I am curious of its taste now.
“Sorry children” always in every video
You weak!
This is such wonderful content…
I forgor
cool, episode, uncle roger! why you don’t go to hard rock hotel in south florida? it’s the best place for uncle roger tell jokes and be close to fort lauderdale and miami for great workation, you can tell joke at winwood in miami also! | chilli jam factory seems great. they seem to put alot of hard work into it, and it’s probably delicious, he seems to have put a lot of work into getting it perfect.
5:17 uncle Roger , so weak !!! so weeaak !!
"we love jamie oliver" (9:09)
Haiyaaa
Wow I love the brits. Usually when there is a celebrity, youtuber or company fight/roast in the US everyone just seethes silently in their million dollar mansion. But the British act so cool, and invite comedians to broaden their horizons. I respect the culture
i think uncle roger can use chilli jam way better than jamir oliver
I really want to know how chilli jam taste like. Btw, the CEO is hilarious
ㅤ
Never tried a Chilly jam, will purchase when I see one in front of me.
Uncle Roger, why so weak?  So weak!
This CEO is a badass.   His product looks gooooddddd
Awesome company, a great attitude to work..
i asked my friend to send me one way far from there.  And honestly, it just tastes as awesome as my usual dosage of eatsambel. so I already know what chili jam im gonna buy later when im having a trip there.
5:17 Hayyah!! So WEAK!
This Tullberg guy is so classically British, like tweed jackets, beans on toast and fish herring. Seeing him in a video with Uncle Roger is just as bizarre as that episode of Martha Stewart where she invited Snoop Dog on her show. Lolololol
Im so stupid that I can't relate that chili jam with Thai meatball sauce, until the owner shows chilli jam with coriander in it
So it's really more of a chili chutney... Chutney is Indian... Chili jam is valid ingredient.
Lol gotta get unc a gym membership he ain’t got no uppies
The sugar pots moment...X Why so weak ?
WAIT WAIT WAIT UNCLE ROGER AND UNCLE NIGEL ARE NOT THE SAME PERSON??? OR AM I TRIPPING
Just watched an entire ad on YouTube premium…
My grandmother in law was from Thailand. She has a chili factory and I guess when you say chili jam I think of sweet chili sauce. Her's is the best, especially when it's with garlic mmm. Put that on top of chicken and rice 🥰
LMAO ahhahaha uncle roger is cute, so small stirring the ingredients with a paddle-like stirrer ahhaha
Ahaha...Kudos to the owner...He has good humor...
Under roger why not Penang ? why KL :<
The CEO was such a good sport that I will buy some Chili Jam and MSG and give away to my friends for Xmas 😂😂
This is Jamie Oliver’s Place of heaven
i'm from the uk and jamie olive oil ruined school lunches. acc needs a beating from auntie helen
try stand up in indonesia uncle roger
why no jakarta? why?
No india. Haiyaaaaa
Chilly wonka
So this where Jamie Olive Oil get his chili jam
You know what's really funny? Uncle Roger don't talk like that in normal life. He over exaggerates his accent and this cute as hell
5:18  why you cant lift bucket  so weak  *SO WEAK*
The CEO and workers made this video, had they not had good attitudes about it; this video wouldn’t be nearly as good😂
Sounds like a soy factory.
My kid came up with this one: What is the opposite of MSG? Jaime Olive-oil.
Guy just gives off the vibes of a amazing grandfather
3,430,351 views, 136k likes, 5.8k comments, 5.78M subscribers. Nice!!
If you’re lucky, you might get some chilli jam made by Uncle Roger- 👁
uncle roger very time he see jamie oliver and chili jam: HAIYAAAAA
"we've got natural flavours" Isn't msg a natural flavour from seaweed? haha
“OH NO NO NO NO NO NO NOOO”
Yall look the same
"TASTE OF REVENGE"🙂
2 20 second ads at the beginning??? Very greedy Woger
0:44 how did you make tis illusion, you made yourself and uncle roger
America isn’t just white people country.
.uncle roger stop acting like a kid!
when the gym training doesnt translate into real life lol
So cool!
Is that actually nephew Nigel or is it himself
It’s not available for Bangkok. 🥺🥺
Name it sweat shop factory 🏭
Man this CEO has some business head
I'm willing to buy Treacklements  stock... prediction ; it going up.😁😁
Why cant you hold the big jars into the boiler uncle Roger? Why so weak? Why so weak? 😂
The CEO looks like a nicer version of Boris Johnson for a non British Person.
Haiyaaa. 5:17 Uncle Roger why you so weak. SO WEAK. It just 1/2 bucket of sugar and you need help.  Is this why Aunty Helen left? You not lift anything heavier than a laptop? I will have to look other way if I see you on sidewalk. You so weak, you couldn't even lift my spirits, haiyaaaaa.....
That CEO certainly knows how to generate good publicity.
Any of us that is living in the UK could have like 0.1% chance of eating the chilli jam made from uncle roger
😂😂😂😂😂 oh my god this video is killing me and am only 4 minutes in. I should have started watching uncle roger waaaay earlier
"Uncle Roger And The Chilli Jam Factory"
So how did they get them both on screen
Is Nigel and uncle Roger not the same person
CEO passes vibe check 👊
Terrible terrible name but such a funny CEO 👍😂
6:21 Haiyaa what was that Uncle Roger you almost spill the chili
the owner looks like general Eiling from the flash
Plot twist: Uncle Roger only went there to take down the factory from the inside.
soooooo week
To be fair, you're not wrong about the branding.
from the recipe the chili jam looks like thai chili sauce. the name jam is the one thats weird. i guess its a british thing
why does this dude look like boris jonson
u love ur customers 2 much? sell bigger jars for the same price i dare u. acting all high and mighty about not selling them less eventho the jar is the smallest jam jar u can buy X D its not even 300ml i bet its under 250.
Is it actually two people? Or am I just HAIYA?
After this video I have tried several Tracklements products (not the chili jam). They’re delicious 😋
Ask help from Jason you're so weak, so weak. 🤣
Uncle roger this was a fun video
I am hoping that the dirt from Uncle Roger's mind does not touch the clean, fresh, white hat
when i saw the title of this Vedjo, i thoought to myswelf '' hmmm ,he'S probably going to bash Jamie Oliver in this video'' and to my surprise it happened in the first 3 seconds :DDDD
I hope we get more videos like this...
After seeing this, I would definitely try his products. Great CEO.
5:17 Uncle Roger why so weak?? so weak!!
I like that ceo he’s pretty funny 😂
This was so good haha I love that Uncle Roger gave them a chance to stick up for themselves and get more people on board with their chili jam. Class 👍🏽
I actually hate Jamie Oliver. He's the reason it takes me 2 minutes longer every time I go shopping. I go shopping once per week so that's 104 minutes per year. The reason it takes longer because of that git is he thought he could get energy drinks age restricted by the government. He failed so instead he got the shops to and guilt them into doing it. Now when I do my scan as you shop some poor minimum wage person has to come over and say that a 36 yo looks over 25 for a product that they've restricted to 16 that isn't illegal for them to sell to anyone. Usually the person who has to check my age is having a nice chat with the person you is running the self service and they don't notice the beacon of gondor going off over my head so I have to wait. That's why I hate Jamie Oliver.
Not sure if uncle roger and nephew nigel are the same person or if I am just racist. I am white so it is possible.
There is an EIGHT year break between the New York Oct 20 2022 show and Toronto Jan 01 2030 shows? WHAT U DOING!?
This CEO is the best....instashit
Đức Phúc tuyệt vời. Giọng hát ấm áp và hay quá
This is just smart af from the company,ill try their product tbh
5:15 so weak, so weak.
You shoulda poisoned it
Uncle Roger so weak
The funny thing is Nike is possibly the oldest name on the list since it's the name of the Greek goddess of victory. It is believed the oldest statue of her is from 550 BCE making the name over 2500 years old if true.
.
Deliciously hilarious 😂 ♥️🇨🇦🌏🇺🇦
I thought Nigel and uncle roger was a diffrent person
chị hướng dẫn “Chuyện đôi ta” đi ạ😽
damn this is gonna sound really sus, but I legit can't tell if Nephew Nigel is actually Nephew Nigel or Uncle Roger with a black shirt and editing.
Hahaha just doing everything totally wrong 7:45 the CEO just has no nod at the lady after, "fix it, yeh".
“Jason help”
tbh i thought i saw joris bohnson in the video lol.
Are there 2 uncle rogers?
It's just wrong, isn't it?  Me rolling boiled new potatoes in MSG: uh... Yeah. So wrong... or, nom, nom.
"Usually when people go to Bangkok, they come back with wife"  Goddamit, that's what happened to my dad. I'm the result of a fucking stereotype akdhishaksnak
did you see how much sugar has been added???? da feck? xD i want chilli not feckin sweet shit...hiyaaaaa....
nigella seeds? oh shit it exists!! 🤣🤣😂😂
Brilliant PR, very funny and the CEO obviously loves his product - Just off to find me some Tracklements Chilli Jam and dill mustard sauce
Just imagine Aunty Helens in there. The man speaks from experience
wait are the people in the intro brothers?,twins?,or edited?
Don’t give the recipe away tells him the recipe
Twin
We caught uncle roger
Come to New York pleaseeeeee
This is a brand I would buy from.. where the CEO is human and not a corporate machine.
Nigela seed....😏
Uncle Roger defeated by plastic bucket, haiyaaaaa
lmao "you look like a cross between a builder and someone who's going to sell me sausage rolls" now I know why he's the boss-man, he's got the humor too 😂  Might have to give Tracklements a try next time I visit the fancy grocery store
U tha only man not in my family who I’d be horrors to call unc
Another version of chili jam here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGsHX4HScDw She makes the Thai version so this might be more pleasing than the one Jamie Oliver uses! :D
Anyone know what the music at the end is?
Cool CEO
me after reading the title: welp rip that factory
So yum~~ Love chilly jam XD
Did his parents just decide to call him guy Like hey guy  Wanna go for a walk
E
E
As an Indonesian i still disapprove chilli jam in my nasi goreng.
I live in the kl
M.S.G
haiyaa.. uncle roger so weak
The MSG being white powder made me laugh fuyooohh
The willywonker part 🤣🤣 not even gunna repeat it but 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jamie Oliver facotry
Bangkok? I love that place(i lived there for 7yrs)
7:05 @huggbess is it a filling machine or a rinsing machine ?
10:00 that's funny😭😭
you guys twin
V
Why you not come to Jakarta? Haiyaaaa
hidden company of boris jonson : EXPOSED xd
which country do uncle Rodger living
I thought chili jam is just chili and jam and they mix it together. I did not know they would put so many ingridients.
I feel bad for peanut allergy people. I bet they have to read the ingredients list just to make sure no nuts are in there. People without that allergy don't need to give a shit.
I really want to buy this Chilli Jam..
I think the chili jams secret ingredient is human meat, he makes too many jokes about it
Give the CEO a blond wig and he will look like Boris Johnson lol
I literally thought uncle roger was pretending to be Nigel as well I’m so stupid I watched too many Steven he videos
Awesome and really funny vid😂😂👍 better get my chillijam
Uncle TickleMan gives, as good as he gets,  quality
2 shows in Vancouver but none in Calgary? Haiyaa 😔
I  will only buy from them now lol
Go to manila my country:)
KL is Kuala lumpur in Malaysia
Just slap him
No, you don't hate chilli Jam. You just hate Jamie Olive-Oil. 😂😂
I love how Uncle Roger can just go meet the CEO guy first time and roast him all the time
Does Cambodia has the shirts?
Whaaaaat the hell...HAIYA...you go show face at a chili jam factory and get punked by it by not being able to pick up a tiny bucket...Haiya... Go get some gains...Where yo gym? Where yo gym?
HAIIIYAAAAA!!!WHEN U GOIN TO COME TO SINGAPORE-
3:35 im guessing he get it from nam prik pao
Tracklements makes the finest condiments, full of natural flavours indicative of substantial quantities of real ingredients. CEO has fab sense of humour, too! 🤩
why so weak
5:18 "Why so weak? So weak."
Canada is not a white person country, it's an eclectic mix of multiple countries peoples. But I do agree with the us comment.
3:40 killed me
INSTASHIT. Is right lad.
The nephew looks so much like him..
kl i no need ticket  need i live there
6:29  got me so good.
Jamie Oliver is a spoilt bratt and more annoying than his speech impediment
why no montreal canada.. aiyaaaa
Oh, it's so cute
No that is a great owner seem like he had a good company there
You're so lucky you don't get your block knocked off more often. 😂😂
Where is KL?
how can a company bring someone in to insult theyre product
One quick question, how to join to mailing list? I'm new fan of Uncle Roger and is it still possible to get the early bird ticket dou?
He found the Jeremy Clarkson of *s a u c e*
Uncle roger: Nike can sue you CEO: yeah may be 😭😂😂
I'm cracking up laughing at uncle Roger but I'm also cracking up at the CEO. He's hard case az. How many kids went missing in your factory lmfao. I can't stop laughing. Thank you for the laughs this morning uncle Roger.
Come hong kong
I thought you were the son of actor ng man tat
Is it like the "bottled sambal" thing in indo ?
I love this educational video Uncle Roger. Even though you dislike Jamie Oliver for putting chili jam in his egg fried rice, you showed all of us what is a chili jam. I only strawberry jams & other fruit jams.
JEEEEEEYYYYSSEEEEEN!!!~~
Damn is uncle annoying af
Uncle roger you have have twin?
Fihyouuuuuu
You roasting him whole day 😂
5:20 Why so weak? So weak Haiyaaaa
He needs to have the CEO in another video
Watched: 22-3-21-14-25
Uncleroger: "I just come to his factory and he keeps insulting me."  Factoryowner: 👀
So, to sum up: Chilli Jam good, Jamie Oliver bad
Very sweet guy!
Those half-mesh trilbies are DOPE. It's where fashion meets safety.
He should of said did you use the right amount or the white amount for the fish sauce
Out of all the places uncle roger could of worked I never thought he would work in a chilli jam factory.
Teringat Khairul Aming
This video is: You have become the very thing you’ve swore to destroy.
The 2 people from beginning are just uncle roger, bc the shadow and lighting makes the editing like shit
I love your channel .I made easy food channel too.
Uncle Roger so weak. Needs Jason to do everything for him.😅
uncle roger  can you visit myanmar also
Most fuiyohs ever. Big win for this company.
Bill Clinton's new job seems to be working out.
Fuiyoh! Singapore 15 June ticket sold out liao! Haiyaa...why 1 night only?
Yay :D
You gave the same voice as Steven He it is a fun fact if you're confused
woah that ceo so good at his job, give motivation to employee
This guy seems great! Would love such a lighthearted, hard working uncle.
5:18 why so weak
2:56 I thought he would go with “So I settled with seeding Nigella.. sorry Children”
The owner is so passionate! The part where he said that he would greet his chilli jams after they are packaged got me melting
This was an amazing video. Thank you for going to the birth house of chili jam.
I think in Thailand they called it "Nam Jim Khai" which translate into fried chicken dip it tastes spicy and sweet Those ingredients look really similar
alternative title : uncle Roger facing his worst fear (besides HOWTOBASIC)
ow wauw really love it thta the company cooperates with this. need to switch brand
PornHub is under a lawsuit for having underaged girls in their videos- #PornHubLawsuit
Wait, is uncle roger and Nigel, two different people? Feels like a joke but why make that joke? Thought for sure it was the same dude and now I’m doubting myself lol
Your commitment in telling the world about nigella 's coke problem is epic...I can't believe you really went there!
My mom like’s chili jam and i dont like it😡
fantastic CEO and company. good for them.
3:40 he loves the sauce -- man of culture!
wow ...I LIVE IN BANGKOK THAILAND
I adore this CEO!!!
Uncle Rodger has made peace with chilijam
does this mean the joke can finally die now
Seriously though. Chilli jam is probably good on cheese.
I think the only reason the CEO dude was actually having fun instead of being offended was because people in Europe always go into extreme vulgarity mode    Yeah Americans suck.
He is making great sh#$@t content!
He really look like an asian uncle 😂😂
So much for those pic's with your shirt off.... All show, no go...
"Jason, help!" 🤣
Chili Jam actually looks good. Except on egg fried rice. It's a crime.
Uncle Roger I want to see your show but i live in adelaide..its between Perth and melbourne..why you not come here? im sad
Whoever came up with marketing idea of this deserves a raise.
Only squinting at work tho 😂 ill tell my boyfriend. Let him know his businesses don't have him that far gone yet 🤣
The lip tho 😂
Uncle Roger why so weak HAHAHA
5:42 sorry children?? Where?
*insert Anakin Skywalker meme* (You've become the very thing which you swore to destroy)
Uncle Roger / Nigel - please drop the white jokes. It's not America, nobody is pointing skin colors here - that's US-only problem. Also, it's not as funny as you might think.
Uncle Rodger I'm probably being a bit defensive but Australia isn't a white country it's indigenous people are the aboriginals my people yes there's a lot of white people here but Australia's became more like a bag of mix lollies there's a lot of everything here again I and probably being a bit defensive but I felt I had to say something
Hope they let me in and don't murder me 😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹
the subtitles for the ceo hilarious
woo
I love it when Jamie Oliver gets roasted he's such a dweeb! Putting jam in rice is like putting jam in pasta. Gross!
He asked him how many children he lost in the factory he really said I've lost count 😭😂😂 that shit got me good lmao
"Nike gonna' sue you", "yeah maybe..."
The Guy is funnier than uncle.. 😂😂😂
They got the humor I like that person...
when i saw this i thought we were going to jamie olivers house
Yeah, but I love sauce.
What about Indonesia?
Pirated version of Heinz ketchup. Why did I find that so funny
Hope Uncle Roger goes to MSG factory next 😎
Fuiyoh
Uncal roger good channel you she Hiuyaaa !!!🙏 RESECT !!!!
Did i hear " NIke 'KENA' sue you"?
Okay, now i really want to have some chilli Jam 😋
"why only white people country?" kinda racist, yellow man
fake accent 100%
Go to a MSG factory
Nice kick to it *punches*
I didn’t know Boris Johnson has a chilli jam factory?
One of the coolest CEOs ever. Man had a sense of humor, definitely did some research on Uncle Roger as well, he gave credit to his employees, showed that they use fresh ingredients in their products and has great pride in the end result of their hard work. He also stayed politically correct when Uncle Roger took jabs at Jamie Oliver. Wish we had more leaders like this in all industries.   It all started with Uncle Roger making fun of their products. Instead of taking it as an insult this guy saw it as an opportunity and got amazing exposure for his company on a popular YouTube channel.  Well done Mr Tullberg. I'll definitely look for your company's products on the store shelves
😆 l was watching the introduction of this video and my dad heard chilli jam. My dad was like what ***** is chilli jam. The other was lost in translation but gave an asian uncle response.
hah, guy's actually really funny
I love how this is just u insulting the jam man for 21 minutes
The chili guru’s voice reminds me of the late Robin Sachs.  Nice video
Do you think of yourself as a good person?   Well as a human race, we aren't inherently good. We all have lied, stolen, and done bad things. Our very nature inclines us do what is wrong. Don't believe me? Well why is it that when we are told not to do something, that's the very thing we want to go and do? Or we want to do something, knowing that the consequences are bad but we still want to do it anyways?   But the good stuff you've done outweighs the bad stuff right?   Well try that in a court of law. "Yes judge, I know I've robbed a bank, but I've given to charity, I've helped people, given food to the homeless, and a lot of other great things, so could you just focus on those things instead and let me go?". If that judge were to let you go, that judge would not be just or fair.   It's the same way with God. Yes, God loves us with an everlasting love. But he also hates sin. Also one of his characteristics is that he's just. So if on judgment day, you say to him, "God, I know I've done some bad stuff, but I'm a good person. Look at all the goodness I have done, I pray every day, I give my tithes..." ect, he won't be just for forgetting the all the sin and letting you into heaven.   However, only 2 types of people are getting into heaven. Perfect people and forgiven people. Perfect people don't exist. However, God is so rich in mercy that He provided a way in which we can be forgiven. He provided us with Jesus.   Jesus was God manifested in the flesh, therefore he was sinless. Despite this, he sacfrifced himself, and all the punishment that we deserved for our sins, past, present and future, was poured out upon Jesus on the cross. Jesus suffered, bled and died so that we don't have to take that punishment. Jesus' last words on the cross was "It is finished". He said this because He paid the debt that was dividing us between God.   Just as in a court of law, if someone pays your fine, your bail, the court can legally let you go.   Justice and the relationship between us and God was restored because of Jesus.   If we repent (change our minds) from trusting in our "goodness" to save us and trust ALONE in Jesus and his finished work on the cross, believing in Him as our Lord and Saviour, we can be forgiven and saved. He will wash away all our sins and transform our hearts, giving us new desires for righteousness. You can also start a beautiful new relationship with Jesus.   Our goodness cannot save us, but Trusting in Him can. God's standard of the Law is perfection and we all fall short. But Jesus can give us His righteousness, as He took away our sin and filth.   Doesn't mean that we'll be perfect, but it means that we'll continue to grow in the ways of the Lord
Come 2 Norway
I like how he says the sauce has a kick to it but punches and doesn't kick
Uncle Rodger so weak with the sugar tub !
8:51 you make me "FEEL SPECIAL" https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3ymwOvzhwHs uncle roger
Actually we do put ketchup and chili sauce in egg fried rice but that really depends if you like it or not.And if he says he got it from bangkok it means it is really spicy stuffs
Why Indonesia does not in ur stand up tour ?
after viewing this video, we bought a few jars of Tracklements Chutneys & Relishes from Waitrose. Simply amazing! Thanks, Uncle Roger 🙂
"So I was travelling in bangkok and thailand" XD

Tracklements is actually one of my fave condiments. 👍

Bangkok and Thailand 🤔...not Asian enough 🤐
i just gotta imagine the talk u have with everyone before making a video.... like "ah, I'm sorry I gotta get into my role now, dont be offended by it, pls" XDDD kinda like that. and people say its ok before they know what theyre getting into XD
Never knew of this brand until this collab with Uncle Roger .... now I wanna buy their products!!
Okay but the crackers with cream cheese, chili jam and cilantro actually sounds good
5:16 oh god I laughed so hard
Really good sport for a CEO
Uncle Roger is litrally rosting their company name and they doesnt even have the sense of humar to react
10:20 "has a nice kick to it" but punches anyways...
The fact that he actually toured a Chilli Jam factory🤣 The war on Jamie Oliver has reached new levels, and the Tracklements CEO has joined our ranks.
6:31 “imagine it’s Auntie Helen in there….”
mandatory pornhub joke as always 😁
Is it one guy or.....?
Is nephew nigel you ore your twin brother?
1:27 uncle roger short king ?
Hello Uncle Roger, why you don't come to Singapore, HAIYAA
"White pepo County haiyaa"
ketamine gets bashed up with MSG
The "jason, help" just made it for me 😂 5:17
Kinda reminds me of conans visits to companys. Well done uncle roger.
8:08 every asians do this when they go to factory as a school trip
What is with Europe for the tour ?! 😔
U Look so asian in the WOKing clothes
I wish we had this in Finland.
I'm confused. Do you have a twin? (Begining of video)
Uncle Roger gets content The company gets advertisement Viewers laugh and know a good place for chilly jam Everyone is a winner
real talk. As a "Buy British" kinda guy, I will make an effort to go tracklement
Never heard of tracklements but if i see it in our stores will give its a shot for sure...
Whaaaat was Uncle roger doing so close to my hometown haha! I hope you enjoyed Wiltshire.
Seeing Orange so many times I would really like to see Roger doing a video with Blippi
Uncle Roger Always making videos and it always makes me hungry haish.
I bought some Chilli Jam!!! It’s bloody delicious!! Got some Spicy Banana Chutney too. It’s all great 👍🏻
i think the most agregious part of this video is the fishnet fedora. i dont know if hes gunna extort me for protection money, get friendzoned by his m'lady, or shake his ass on the stripper pole
Too much sugar? Why so weak? Why so weak?
"How to do marketing (advanced)" would be a fitting alternate title
I don't even know chili jam i just know it because of Uncle Roger's reaction at Jamie
The f*+king egg fried rice is everywhere🤣
Where's Jamie olive oil?🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. Lmfao.
im tempted to buy one and turn to the white side
that is a cool boss
3:42 Next Meme Material
This niece girl life so sad too
3:03 Sorry children
Lol! I want the movie: Uncle Roger goes to Willy Wonka Factory of Chili Jam Multiverse. 4:05
somehow my gut feeling told me uncle roger will be roasting jamie oliver in this video hahaha
And you guys just saw a full-length ad 😂
I love it he's so good at making people feel uncomfortable
The orange vest was definitely not for safety.
dont give the recipe away =))))
lol the ceo really knew who he was brining
He throws out Auntie Helen, Uncle Roger gets hate pounding on!
Jakarta please!
When can u come to India bro!!
Chilli jam is literally Asian Chilli oil, but thicker and sweeter
Uncle Roger cannot lift the bucket or stir haiyaaaaaa so WEAK....why so WEAK?!
YES YES YES CANADA
Thanks so much for presenting this wonderful company 😊 I hope to try the jam and the sauce soon!
are they twin??
Nigel what was up with the white balance in that first interview shot man :( hurts my eyes
had a pretty shit day, one video of yours and im smiling so bad :D thx for your content buddy
Manila uncle ?
I like that guy,he can take sarcasm and awkward jokes like a champ 🏆🏆
Imagine telling a CEO such a weak brand name lmao
Damn, made with actual spices instead of just being a chemical vat, this is some of the best product showcase I have seen in a long time
Why you so weak, so weak
so weak your brand name muaahahahhaahahhahahahaa
"so why don't you imagine it's AUNTIE HELEN in there" ***Uncle Nigel Proceeds to stir it aggressively***
India missing?
Wheres the video where you make egg fried rice?
is Rodger's favorite spice nigella becuase his name is nigel or because he likes cumin hmm... chili jam isnt that far from sriracha but dont confuse it with paprika jam or think think avacado jam is the next thing for your blt or watermelon jam for your omlete . if you like cottage cheese black coffee with broccoli jam okay .
Uncle Roger so weak. Need help to lift sugar. Haiya
This was entirely too funny on level after level!! It is comparable to classic comedy, the kind of show that you love to watch repeats of because the banter and wit is so swift! Thank you so much, ‘Uncle Roger’… My Dad was rushed to the hospital/Russia invaded the Ukraine/my boyfriend is ‘recovering’ from a coma/my first son is heading to Marine boot camp after his high school graduation this June. I need all of the smiles that I can find, and am definitely slipping them into my pocket for later!  🤗 You are one of my favorite smiles!  Thank you for being you. Also…. Chili jam sounds tasty!  But Jamie Oliver is lazy to use it in his recipes… it’s a condiment, Yo!!!  😅  Lastly, wearing the uniform I must say that you look as ‘Cool as a cucumber in a bowl of hot sauce’… Intergalactic, indeed!!  🤖
Excellent video
uncle roger you keep using Twice Feel Special , who is your fav member? any plans to colab with them?
is that white version of shaq?
hiyaaa chillly jam hiyaaaa
Holy balls this is hilarious and I love everyone involved
Best joke: imagine aunti helen there
He talks to his jars. So cute. He really  loves what he does.
I think I'm going to try chilli jam.
Why not call him "Chilli Wonka" haaiyaaah
so weak, SO WEAK
I like going on holiday to black country's like Jamaica and africa
I truly enjoyed this video lol loving the CEO sense of humor ❤️ also seeing HOW WEAK & LOUSY Uncle Roger IS…..not was but IS 😏 So weak so weak….why so weak? 😏
The UK Shaq everybody 😳
Uncle Roger is gonna make this chilli jam popular!!
I live in Poland but want to check out Tracklements products now. Good move on their side and a very enjoyable video :)
"Yeah,but I like the sauce" 😂
Colab with Steven he
The point of the chilli jam on fried rice joke is that egg fried rice is an ASIAN dish and chilli jam is like a british person's shortcut to make (poorly cooked) fried rice taste better. As an asian person, I have no problem with the existence of chilli jam because that's a british thing (I mean...it's a jam, not a chutney or preserve). Chilli jam and cream cheese dip sounds great! Just don't put it into Singapore noodle. There is no 'betrayal' here on the part of either Tracklement or Uncle Roger. Context matters.
So you went to Jamie Oliver's house
Hilarious 😂
Tracklements is def my favourite chilli jam, use it in all my kitchens. Guy and his family are great.
When it’s 0:52 I was like waht the fuck 2 uncle roger?
i will remember tracklements if i see it in the store
I will try this jam
👏👏👏
You said there's a show in Bangkok, but not on the website
but dont give the recipe away! also uncle roger:
I don't even know what chilli jam is. Hiya What. Anyways..not good for ppl with diabetes. Too much sugar.
So if i brought a 50 lb sack of msg, id get stopped?
4:06 The color of the floor makes it look like the factory has sunk 6 inches into a bog
"jam" ie oliver
Why does he add twice feel special in every video😂 is he a once
"Well, i call it Instashit"
Nephew Guy is awesome 🤣🤣🤣
Comedy, heartwarming, branding. Amazing.
Why no Adelaide
I love how these guys have a sense of humour. This was awesome.
UNCLE ROGE: very difficult CEO:  so why dont you imagine its AUNTIE HELEN in there ?   UNCLE ROGE murder face  UNCLE ROGE: Uncle Roger suddenly have SO MUCH STRENGTH.
Uncle Roger meets Borat. Let's make it happen.
Respect for uncle roger and the ceo, both a good sports
Instashit LOLLLL
Wait there's two people?
Why so weak 5:16
"INSTASHIT"  Well said, nephew guy ! 😂🤣
10:06 😂😂😂
Wait, you can't lift the bucket of sugar ? Where are the muscles you showed off the other time ?? 😧😭🤣
I haven't watched the video yet but I'm pretty sure it's delicious. I love sweet and sour dishes. ☺
Uncle Roger y so weak in this wideo?so weak?
UNCLE ROGER vs chili jam
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 watching your videos at 4:35am EST.... it's so hard not to wake up my sweetheart, but OMG!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
finaly someone who don't fear chilli, what a unique white guy :D
I love jalapeño jelly on cream cheese
I’m dieing rn 😂
CEO cool dude. Making me rethink not buying chili jam
uncle roger weak as fuck
"Nike gonna sue you" "yeah maybe" 👀🤣 well he's certainly got the spirit of Asians lol
"It has nice kick to it" starts punching
do more like  this vid
Uncle Roger: *throwing insults* Nephew Guy: yea yea he he
3:36 this is true, that’s how my grandparents met
Uncle Roger: “In Asia, we only use white hat when somebody die…” Guy: *awkwardly coughs* 😂🤣
best move of his to invite him since people are dumb and with a crowd of 5 million there are bound to be some who dislike jilly jam after he picks on it so much (which he does for fun) without ever trying it. pretty chill guy :D but smth tells me you dont wanna be on his bad side...he has some mafia boss vibes as well xd.
This is fun
So are you or are you not the same person
Haiyya how bout The pbillipines
Roger and Nigel are two separate individuals? Nah, must have been green screened.
Ive purchased their chili jams before! They’re really nice on toast ! Nice to know they’re such good sports about Uncle Roger roasting them😂
Please do a review of Almazan kitchen.
Nephew Guy, so funny. Great sport.
you are a racist 0:30
Racist
I use chili jelly at times, but only in an extreme pinch. Most of the time I forget it's there, and I get asian
Am I the only one who thinks that the CEO sounds like Harry Kane
Poor Jamie Oliver. After watching him get roasted constantly, I want to hug him and brush his hair as he cries in my arms.
5:36  Uncle roger is so weak
"tastes of revenge." ah it must be sweet then
Uncle roger should try swiss cheese fondue
Nephew Guy sound like Shark from Finding Nemo
I had a feeling chili jam really wasn't that bad
So Uncle Roger work for Uncle Nigel
Uncle Roger Hiyyaaaas why you no come to Atlanta :(
i love the HAYAAAA AND THE FUYOHHH
Uncle Roger on hotones. Let's go
It's nice to hear somebody say KL considering how small Malaysia is
“This too much Jason help” 😭
Cool  CEO well job well done! :) Its good to see people can smile of their own :3
Congrats nephew Nigel! Remember seeing you at the Camden Head maybe 3 yrs ago and now a world tour! Great stuff.
omo did he just use TWICE,  i dont mind his stereotypical/ orientalist persona and i liked it before but it does seem a bit pushed sometimes like that's all whats going for him. Although if his joke are good at times i cant complain much
Geeeez, don't be mean to nice people. xD xD xD
I've never seen chilli jam...is it a British thing?
This company is absolutely lovely, great CEO.
Uncle roger GOOD
keep growing )
just the "yeah maybe" he don't give a shit lol XD
This CEO sounds like the army fish from SpongeBob when mrs.puff needed a substitute and he was so tough and successful with SpongeBob till the end
Wait so is chili jam the white people's crappy version of thai sweet chili sauce?
3:00 Who allowed him to play with the spices that will go in our jams?
he was so casual about where he puts the kids
This is one of the best CEO's I've ever seen. "How many children have been lost in your factory?"  "I've lost count. We just put em in here."
This is Jamie Oliver heaven
Why is there two uncle Roger
"how many children dies in this factory" "I've lost count" you die when you get here
Now I want to buy Chili jam 😭😭
0:40 why not also ho chi minh city and hanoi
WHY NOT INDONESIAAAA
I've often used chilli jam, when I'm super lazy and just want a spicy condiment that's very viscous on my food
Hiya, why not DPRK? why only brown people Asian country's?
I love how he contaminates the seasoning with his hand, they probably had to throw it out  lol
Especially don't bring MSG in your suitcase to KL.
haiyaa
Now I wanna try this chilli jam.
wholesome :)
THIS BOSS MAN PASSED THE VIBE CHECK ! Awesome video
"N!ke gonna sue you" -- "Yeah, maybe"  XD  This is possibly the best Uncle Roger pairing ever.  XD
"I call it InstaShit" -- I fucking love this guy!!  XD
Also, Uncle Roger continually calling the guy who is CLEARLY older than him "nephew" is just sending me.  XD XD XD
7:11-7:33  Uncle Roger make everything sexual!!  Yet no "sorry children" here??  XD
Bii!iitch; we done seen your muscles on Facebook AND tha' Gram, don't act like that sugar bucket was too heavy.  XD
I didn’t expect to see a filling machine in this
Tracklements. Now I know this brand, im frm Malaysia
I'd like to see you tour the Sriracha factory in Irwindale .
I love this guy and the company's dig at aunty helen
Why not INDIA 😀❤️
Is Nigel And Roger A Different Person?
Is Nigel And Roger A Different Person?
Looks like the nicest people in the world at this factory.
thebottom lip poke out lmao
8:29 he is the british Trump 🤣
Uncle Roger bad worker, not like other Chinese factory worker
i do love some chilli jam, ngl
Germany needs Uncle Roger soooo much❣️
Tracklements makes amazing condiments! I end up buying loads when I see them in a farm shop 😍
And he remained unsued till today
Uncle Roger is my favorite...I have never laughed so much 😂. I just recently found this channel..and can't stop watching lol.
I love that he got a safety vest just so he could still wear an orange shirt
A company in Oklahoma, Suan's, makes an awesome Jamaican-inspired Scotch Bonnet jam.
If you get made fun of by a popular youtuber, you embrace it. If the people love their joker, they will love the company that has been a good sport about it. Other example would be flexseal, becoming a meme has probably made them some good money.
Wonder if the person he got the recipe off gets royalties? .... Carlos Mensaucier
I made in to 2:32 and found it too cringe.
The Wolf of Chilli Jam
5:17  me : Uncle roger...  why so weak ?! Haiyaaaa
It went from him ripping on white people to him not being strong enough to stir a pit of jam 😂 they roasted him good
Love how the CEO takes the joke and squeeze Uncle Roger's arm muscle when he can't life up the sugar bucket 🤣
next will be MSG factory
YOU MAKE ME FEEL SPECIAL
nigella seed gang:)
The next host of dirty jobs
Chappeau to Guy  Tullberg, handled that beautifully. Bigged up @Tracklements and team, showed a human side. Fantastic work.
Why so weak? It's sugar
Is that Chili jam sweet?
Its obvious this guy is a fan
CEO with a down-to-earth sense of humour? That means he has a good balance between social- and business-like steering. RARE.
This might just be a theory but are uncle roger and nephew Nigel the same people
@mrnigelng would love to see your version of Mexican Rice.
Do you have twin
Coolest CEO ever 😎
Visits their instagram but didnt see any Uncle Roger photos. Hiyaah why.
I'm starting to think uncle roger and nephew Nigel are the same person
0:45  isn't india asian?
when uncle roger bit the chip in half made me angry
MSG needs to sponsor him 😅
paid promotion?
However thought of this idea of bringing Uncle Roger into the factory got a juicy raise
11:10 I lost it here
no wonder my spice does be hot in the country am in tho
Why don’t you try number 1 chili sauce of Vietnam - CHIN-SU chili sauce
if you draw a pentagram with Chilli jam. you can summon Jamie Oliver
looks good but not in egg fried rice
I definitely would like to try the extra hot chilli jam that has 80 chillies in a bottle. Do they sell that in KL...🤔
lol
Nigella is 60+ years old… ahh ya! uncle roger thinks women are like wine…
0:29 Wait wait wait WAIT- i thought those were the same person
Nike gonna sue you 😂
Funni
Come to Singapore please
This guy has it on for Jamie Oliver haaiyaa
Tracklements hit the local supermarket last year, bit pricey but i really love their strong mustard :-D
They r the lost brothers of oz
Oh i see.. the chilli jam is look like "Nam jim Kai" in Thailand. It's make the same ingredients, chilli sugar and vinegar. It taste hot and sweet but it's the sauce for dip not for cook. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
so cringe worthy... I thought Guy was going to beat him up! haha... good publicity for tracklement
3:02 I knew that accent was a fake.
why does uncel roger and his nephiew look the same
Sooo uncle Roger gonna start using chilli jam in your egg fried rice now?? Haiyaaaa 😁🤣🙃😂
This company is smart
The shade  😭😭😭
Uncle Roger how you so weak
This is hilarious you can feed it to Jamie oliver
what a great sport that owner is great vijeo!
The ceo looks like Boris jhonson
That CEO is an excellent sport... the world needs more like him!
I have new respect for Uncle Roger! He plays the game well... From roasting Jamie Oliver using Chilli Jam to an amazing video at the Chilli Jam factory. Now he keeps planting seeds for Nigella Lawson. When will we seem him squirting his hot sauce over her?
Great video, need to get a jar of their produce now me thinks!
Why no India. Nephew Rithvik sad :(  ....... EmOtIoNaL DaMaGe !!!!!
Uncle roger in his mind : what is this!  Chillie jam plss stop your killing me!😐
The marketing team if  Of tracklement and the CEO being so on board also is very good PR
This is one of the best public x youtuber collabs I have ever seen, the CEO rolled with the jokes and got his message across at the same time the only other time i've seen this work well was some bon appetit videos and like 1 unus annus video
The second i saw this video i was like i have to watch this
Your one funny guy. You went this far just to find out what child jam is 🤣
he called canada a white country thats how insane the colonial powers are destroyed my people and now i live in a "white country"
“How many children have you lost in here?” “Too many I’ve lost count” Hahaha so relatable. 😏
damn you are very very strong
This nephew is funny haha, nice video
Are they 2 different people or 1 person
"This place couldn't get any whiter" ~Uncle Rodger
1 year ago more like 2 years ago
"This too much jason.. halp" 5:16
Oh nooo.... its like hating Hitler and then going to a tea party with him.... not gut.... not gut... but the CEO is great dude though
Do they sell that sauce in 🇺🇸?
Nice tour, I like the CEO he’s so chill.
Roger is so weak lol How does he have abs? 😂🤣
He got some "gewd" jokes there🗿
how much did thay pay you for this
Haiyaaaaa, no Philippines?
So Despicable Me got it right!
Aiiiyyaaaaaaa uncle roger hates Canada, only one show.
haiya
it’s like sweet chilli sauce but why call it jam
Uncle Roger looks younger than Nephew Nigel...
It's -21 tonight in Minnesota US. I'm germinating dozens of super hot pepper seeds. Chili peppers and chili jams  are catching on everywhere because of channels like this.  I only just found Uncle Roger. I want to shout out Johnny Scoville for eating peppers. And Jimmy Pickles for growing them in the US.
Uncle's smile's are so pure.
Not gonna lie, I want to try Chilli jam. Maybe on a burger though, not fried rice.
This  is a nice company
Not everyone in the uk likes Jamie Oliver. He took my turkey twizzlers and pizza slices out of school meals
Hi
'Chili Wonka' or 'Boris Jamson'. You can use those if you send me free rice maker.
Nephew Guy sounds a lot like Shaquille O'Neal!!
You made a typo in the title, i THINK you meant "heresy factory"
I rly want uncle roger to come to India
Why da ticket so expensive! I can watch Uncle Rodger from my couch on YouTube! Without pants!
He’s not allowed in Tokyo or Korea because they are still shut down for Covid until late this year
More CEO's should be like this. All my respect to Guy Tullberg. Seems to be a great workplace at Tracklements! <3
I hope Jamie Oliver doesn’t feel left out.
now that's what i call marketing
I had a tinder date that loved sauce aswell.
It's not tracklements! it's the naked chef's fault hahaha
“Jason Help” 😂😂💀
Somewhere out there are few jars made by uncle roger which might taste different
1:38 NIKE is ancient Greek goddes, so not that modern either
This boss.. seems like a regular decent bloke.. good laugh too.. gonna try tracklements.. extra spicy..FUIYOH!!!
Where's the animated Uncle Roger special for Netflix.
FUIYOHHHHHH!
The best CEO
NGL NIGEL.... this one was funny as shit i fucking loved it i loved how the owner was back a forth he seems like a  very interesting dude . could do another one there with other sauces ! MUCH LOVE FROM CANADA MY DUDE!
Why does my tiny brain really think of them as two different people?
I thought the both of them was same person I didn’t know they look same different people
jamie oliver doesn’t need to use any spices because he uses chili jam lol
Cool vibe on that guy. He can take a joke and can dish out some in return.
Having tried a lot of Chilli Jams (and I like it in fried rice ... sorry, not sorry!) Tracklements is one of the best, it's got some real kick and decent flavour. Definatly worth trying it if you haven't already to the commenters of YouTube <3
Great marketing strategy for the company. This video got me interested in their products.
Top notch CEO.... good for the humour
Ggjh
Uncle Roger is so weak. So weak.
No one buys chilli jam twice.
I love that old guy ahahaha
For some one who hates it so much you sure are obsessed with it lol
Uncle roger cant lift bucket? Why so weak? Why so weak?
OMG this absolutely made my day
Uncle Roger has  twin or no ,as i am new comer
INDONESIA PLEASEEEEE🥺🥺🥺🥺
Is this where jamie oliver gets his red paste for egg fried rice
I thought uncle roger and nephew nick were the same person
Even though he hates the use of chili jam, he STILL comes to the factory to get humbled. He's doing this for you Jamie, and you didn't even deserve it!
8:12 "And I say "Good luck fellas,hope you don't end in egg fried rice"
I hit like when careless whisper came on ...
10/10 Tracklements, never heard of you. Now I have upmost respect :D
I thought that uncle roger would go to a old lady’s cottage and make jam 1 jar a minute….👵
I give CEO 1000% for going along with the gag!
In the beginning when Uncle Roger and the boss were talking in the shop, the Boss was eyeing Uncle Roger like a bag of M.S.G.
Uncle Roger - you can add a little less and be millionaires Lays - your hired    :)
It was 10 minutes of roasting each other.
3:32 - 3:40 I'm Thai. I know. that hilarious. hahahahahahahahaha
This is great 😂😂😂😂
To be honest... The CEO knew he owes Nigel in somewhat way.. cause he did make chili jam a talk in town.. even if it is not in a manner he wanted it to be.. but publicity is publicity.. we all knew that
5:21 uncle roger so weak so weak
wait which KL. the India KL or the Malaysia KL?
best add i'v ever watched
I want Jamie Oliver+ uncle roger gonna be something really special
到底是辣椒还是果酱，还是简单的辣椒酱。。
What's the song at the end?
‘Imagine aunt Helen in there’ 😂 uncle roger suddenly have strength😂😂😂😂
fuiyyyoo😂
Uncle Roger call people weak if they no put msg or meat in food but Uncle cannot lift bucket of sugar.... so weak... so weak.... HAIYAAA!!!
I was expecting some joke about the cursed drawer full of jar in James oliver kitchen.... Still awsome vid as always.
Lmao love this ceo!
Uncle Roger probably just made a jar that will be used by Jamie Oliver in a video
Hold up I thought Nigel was uncle Roger
You're the biggest person in here... pretty sure the person in the background is bigger...
Some Black people hate Jamie Oliver he made jerk rice so not everyone in Britain liked him
Uncle Roger wandered into Jamie Oliver territory and paid the price by eating chilli jam.
Maybe someone in uncle Roger’s family die because he with guy who make this weird jam
So chilli jam is basically like asian chilli sauce. Then again we only use chilli sauce as dipping, not really in cooking
Lovely
This guy is great way to banter back and forth
Factories like this one are just screaming out to be in a plotline in Midsommer Murders...
Nooooo the tickets for Seattle are sold out 😭😭😭 why YouTube didn’t give me a notification on this vid I would love to see your show 🥺 wish you had done Portland OR also
This is so cool! Both the company owner and uncle Roger are so much fun. So there is nothing wrong with chilli jam, it’s the person using it 😛
Dont trust any person in the food industry that is against msg...
Salam uncle roger....says Dari kL ❤️❤️
just AWESOME :) no further words needed
Sorry children 😂
I usually eat bread with anything that says jam. Chili jam might be one of them too.
The CEO guy with the hat kind of looks like Boris Johnson.
Uncle Roger hate we have uncle Roger like we like
This CEO is a very smart. Millions in free advertising. Seems like a great guy as well, which makes me want to buy his product.
Uncle Roger: Haiyah, nephew Guy why you suddenly dressed like fish monger!?  Nephew Guy: And you have to dress up too.  Uncle Roger: NNNOOOOO!
Why doing only White Countries ? $$$ that’s way Uncle Roger
Lol, Uncle Roger you made them loose revenue, so they bring you in to get the hype back up. I hope you got your bag!
What does he mean, he loves sauce?
Uncle roger roast everyone he meet😂
Haiya, no tour to Jakarta ah
6:27 Nephew is true fan.
MSG company next😀😀
I am waiting for your show in Bangkok!!!
Bangkok too? Fuiyooooooo
NOOOOO WHY NO SINGAPOREEEE
Nice to see that rinsing machine
Why do Nigel and Rodger look the same?
"so why don't you imagine it's Auntie Helen in there?"  That man just passed the vibe check
I love there products
Uncle Roger looks soo cute in this video!
Why nephew guy didn't love Thai girl???
Nephew guy is into his "sauces"
Why can’t any of the youtuder come in South Africa and do fun things 😭love you uncle roger💕❤️🥰
Who was that other guy who look like uncle ?
Oh no, he has been seduced by the chili jam... just don't try to pound it :p XD
MSG is still natural XD
Uncle Roger can lift rice bag, but not bucket of sugar? Why so weak?
WILTSHIRE LESGOOO
Greetings! I’m from Thailand UNCLE, I can’t access to buy the ticket for bkk. It might a lil mistake.
Please don’t use chilli jam to make egg fried rice Mr.Jamie Oliveoil.
I dont understand why they wearing white extra clothes but not put the mask on to cover their nose and mouth for hyigennic reason. And also glasses to eye safety
Sauce guy

"This too much...Jason help!"
I love this CEO....his whitty replies to all the shade Uncle Roger throws at him
😂
Just for being cool im gonna check out this brand. Nephew Ceo is cool
Nigella Lawson watching uncle rogers vids:      👁 👄 👁
I love how the CEO is like: Yeah and why did I let that dude in again??? Ah my life choices
8:34 is that a child
This guy looks like he is about to offer me a 50 bucks iphone but if I bargain then I can get it for 7.
This chilliwonka CEO is such a nice guy.. This video is good marketing for their chilli jam Factory... Fuiiiiyooooh
Why not philipines haiyahhh
Uncle Roger has done more to let people know about the existence of chili jam than anyone else.
You missed HI uncle Roger!! Next time.
Yo I live there
seems like, only uncle roger can diss Jamie Oliver for like eternity
Today my sister was wearing a white hat and my mom slapped it of her head and said “如果你戴白帽子，表達你家有人死了”
Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the LORD your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you." Deuteronomy 31 8
Guy must've been one of those shy kids in class who would occasionally dish out some incredibly funny quips
Are they the same person
im buying tons of chilli jam now so i can get uncle roger jam
it's just sugar... why so WEAK!!!!
Uncle roger and uncle Nigel different person?!?! I never knew
2:05 😂
Be sure to believe, have faith and trust God and and repent of your sins so that when he comes back if you have been doing these you have been saved already.  and all sins are forgivable (except blasphemy against the Holy Spirit) because of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross.    and don't worship the antichrist when he comes he will force the world to worship and give them the mark of the Beast which doesn't let you go to Heaven.  And I'm not forcing you by the way God did give us free will 😎👍                                                     But it is better to know God before he comes back with wrath  And Jesus was nailed onto a cross because of our sins and he lived a perfect and sinless life and he isnt mad that we were the reason he died on the cross, after he died he was brought back to life and he wants us to put our faith in him and to trust his sacrifice so when we die we can enter Heaven.  And we can Know while we are still here. Don't let Jesus be a stranger to you. Don't let him   say "Depart from me for I do not know you"  But let him say   "Welcome home my good and faithful servant"  Have a Great day!   Sorry if I annoyed you   Summed up  don't worship antichrist (the one who gives a marking if you do (the mark being 666) if you do, you will go to hell later. And have faith in Jesus Christ to go to heaven  God has answered some of my prayers and I've felt the Holy Spirit and hes sent me signs and there are Bible prophecies that have come true).   . And sorry if I annoyed you. .
The word Auntie Helen gives Uncle Roger superpower
😄😄😄
Uncle roger look ripped when wear no shirt orange shirt and orange sleeveless shirt but cannot stir simple ingredient in large pot for chili jam. So weak SO WEAK!
Guy’s morale boost    “Then imagine it’s aunty Helen in there”
Uncle Roger why so weak 🤣
Makes me actually want to try chilli Jam!
Where, in Bangkok and Thailand, did the CEO guy eat chilli jam? I live there for 40 years, but never saw things like that. It can be something like “chilli sauce” (for dipping spring roll, etc.).
why not have one in China HAIYAA
Jamie Oliver would probably put chilli jam in ramen and call it hot pot.
Why no Indonesian haiya
Oncle roger new job
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WHY NOT INDONESIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Man literally became kingpin
5:19 Uncle Roger so weak...haiza...
They have no mask
Asking if Jamie Oliver is his customer had me dying.
5:17 why so weak?
Auntie Helen don't like this  nephew 😒
When Uncle Roger walked in the factory he looked like my dad when he walks in my room
Omg he actually has a different accent... I'm kinda disappointed now
This video made me smile. Deserves my like and comment :D
i like this jamie oliver roast episode
i'm getting dumber. are there two of them or is he just too good?
Its just wrong putting MSG in carbonara  Says the one who i assume using cream to subtitute the cheese sauce
You are sooo weak! Soooo weak! Fuiyoh!!
Ngl, I just like the hats lol, looks great for work and after work
very funny. you make me laugh aloud !
Sorry children.
Jamie oliver fried rice to weak to be called fried rice only can be called plate of soggy wet shit
i wanna go to tokyo so bad
Even that guy knew auntie helen
This video makes me want to eat chili jam fried rice now
Fuiiyoh 👏 you CEO of fried rice 👏👏👏👏
Msg is a natural ingredients available in nature,  most spices also have msg,  wat the heck the factory ceo talk about,  go study before starting a factory 😂
I still can't get over the character development and plot twist here. What a wild ride!
Great job Mr ceo guy.  Glad some real mfers in charge at some of these places.
Chili jam with cream cheese is delicious on crackers.  Been a christmas snack for years in my family.
Really nice to see Nephew Guy knows his Uncle Roger lore.
I'm Thai so in that is พริกเผา (prik-pao) in Thai it can do tomyum  It to delicious.>:)
WBKWBKOHZ4HOROHXRHOORHXPIVZTPRSH KL??????? IM IN KK IM SOBBING SO HARD
Uncle Rodger out here replacing Mr. Rodgers 😊
So, Josh Peck stopped acting and made a career with chili jam? It has to be stressful, look how old he got all of the sudden
Bankok
🔮💕🍏🔮
Aw man not Hong Kong?
0:40 No Turkey? Racist are we? Jk
LOVE this CEO!! 🤣🤣🤣
Hum
Fun fact: Jamie Oliver actually used this particular brand of chili jam in his egg fried rice 🙄🙄
Dont hate the ingredients, Hate the people who decide what to do with the ingredients. There is always a place for anything in the world.
no Jakarta for your standup tour? HAIYAAAA
I want to try that chilli jam
Nice my sister like your videos
This guy fills many jars
"Only squirting at work, this guy like Wolf of Wall Street" I love how he turned an insult into the best compliment ever
Chili Jam
Looks delicious, but unfortunately I live in Russia
Uncle Roger, why not come to Toronto, Canada? Don’t you know Toronto, Canada has the second largest Asian population in Canada?
5:18 more weakness
4:42 Sooo weak
I’m so sad I can’t go to your stand-up ;-;
❤️
Anyone noticed Uncle Roger occasionally plays Twice's song in his video? Is he a fan of Twice?
U should come to nz for ur tour!
I wish i could see you live here in philly…but since i cant be vaccinated, im not ALLOWED because PA seems to think we live in the USSA instead of America.  🤬 Vax required to enter public venues starting 1/2022  Hmmmm when else in history were papers needed to do things? Those who support this are on the wrong side of history, ethics, and are anti-freedom. I would have the same stance even if i was able to get the jab, but since health reasons prevent me from getting it, im even more infuriated.
Ariel, cleans 99.9% germs! *that 1% germ: uses chili jam from jamie oliver*
Seriously minute 8:30 when that guy with the Jack  Willis tshirt shot a glance at the camera made me laugh so much...i dont know why...i just love the irony of all of this n the winner is always going to be the company and Uncle Roger...now let me google the brand😂😂😂
Can it please finally be common sense that MSG is NATURAL?! It's in tomatoes, mushrooms, kombu and what not! Please don't give the impression (dear factory employee) that MSG is the devil. Glutamate itself is important for the metabolism of many living beings. The story, that MSG is bad, was supposed to be a joke by a physician...and sadly nobody understood that joke and just agreed to his statements (getting headaches, allergic reactions, etc.). It's so sad :(.  (Yes, I do take this seriously ^^)
"Nike gonna sue you" "....Yeah, maybe" I can't 🤣🤣🤣 Now I really wanna try this chilli jam
Uncle Roger not everybody likes Jamie Oliver in the UK
Hai ya, can't lift bucket?.... So weak, so weak.
He says don’t give the recipe away recording and saying every ingredient in the recipe
I love this fatherrrr!❤️
Can’t go I’m only 10 but really want to see you in sg
no Philippines 😥
69 batrey

chili jam definition- only used when want to trigger Uncle Roger
Ayo his editing skills are next level
Thumbs up to this CEO for keeping up with Uncle Roger and going along with all the jokes.👍
oh no um late its already dec 13 :(
Hi
3:03 My favourite part/Uncle Roger=Sorry children
Is it me or does the guy sound like Boris
Uncle Roger cannot stir chili jam. Why so weak?, why so weak?
Imagine someone Eats the chili jam Uncle Roger mixed and they suddenly feel like they had the sweet taste of a satisfying revenge
He breaks character at 3:00
ชิลีแจมขยี้ได้ตลอดจริงๆ5555555
Respect that stop in Philly (my home town).....but bruh, how are you gonna jump from Seattle to Australia and skip the Aloha State?!?!? Was so pumped to see you going out on a world tour - then I got kicked in the nuts with the middle of the Pacific ocean snub. Total hate on the 808. Speaking of....my 8 year old loves Unko Roger and was coming with me 😏
This was a good video. Now I just wait till the day you meet Jamie Oliver.
Hey uncle Roger how do you make chicken broth
His name is Guy and he wear blue shirt :D
I love this video. It's a perfect way to showcase that beyond the humor, there's real people making a quality product; and that they can get in on the joke. This is EXACTLY how to handle a situation like this, so that both sides end up looking fantastic.
The king of flavour actually is MSG  he needs to put MSG
"Yeah but I love jam"... What a great response.
As an Indonesian this is my nightmare. In Jakarta we hate eating chili jam  We just pound our own chili's make our own sambel to eat
The cutest promotion ever 😍
At 7:34 this is what they do in china all day
5:27 Poor Uncle Roger got dodged 😂
This CEO guy is like the weird uncle we all have, what an adorable human being
no one:  me: *” Guy “*
5:37 purple aki vibes
God tier editing
HOW
What a crock of crap!  They wont ship to the US.  Or maybe it's just California they wont ship to.  Oh well, take my money somewhere else.
I'm touring Canada too😒only Vancouver
I love these mini adventures, so wholesome yet hilarious xD
When are you goig to the MSG factory?
That’s how I grew up eating pepper jelly with cream cheese! So good
Uncle Roger bottle chilli jam available soon
Baked beans are the anti MSG
Uncle Roger just cooked auntie Helen🤣🤣🤣
Really sympathetic chef !Love to see him laughing! He has fun and his funny his self !! Great 👍 thank you very much
Really sympathetic chef !Love to see him laughing! He has fun and his funny his self !! Great 👍 thank you very much
Uncle Roger, can you review this fried rice making video? https://youtu.be/eY1FF6SEggk
The chili jam will be like our chili sauce, I think.
HAIYAAAA.  why so weak
Can't lift bucket of sugar? Why so weak? So weak?!
the fact that i'm in adelaide is pretty sad rip
This is not funny at all.
Talk to your editor! Sound is out of sync with wideo.
"got nice kick to it" *punches*
The CEO’s really cool from beginning to the end 👍
Ok but like guy takes it to easy
Guy is either really tall or uncle Rodger is just……..short
Absolutely love these fucked up videos. I bet the nightmares are auntie Helen and Jamie Oliver making fried rice
IM FROM THAILAND WELL MY FAMILY IS THAI
COLAB WITH STEVEN HE
Why they don’t wear mask in food processing plant?
Hyaa uncle roger ancestors left the chat why so weak why do weak
This nephew is a good sport.
Amazing video, educational. Thanks Uncle Roger!
I started being a fan 1 year ago lol
The CEO is the new purple aki, squeezing peoples muscles
Malin binuka na luknog an duwa
this is video sponsered by  chili jam, YAYAYAAAA!
In America warehouse food production is self governed by something known as sqf safe quality food it's basically an agreement between all the companies to keep mainly Metals in high quantities of bacteria out of your food products and containers it's important to have the certification because you won't get a lot of business if you don't
That was awesome, like the break from the regular VLOGs.
Haiya i just got back from bangkok
Uncle Roger, u need to start eating vegetables instead of MSG 💪🏼  (The CEO is hilarious)
He is just a sosi guy.
OMG AM DYING. This was so funny and made better because Guy-nephew went all along with it. Such a good sport and he can dish it out too! So awesome! Also love how it used different cultures and customs in 1 product. Ok, let me see how to obtain 1 pot of chilli jam, will request Guy-nephew to talk to it before sending it over to me
Hm... maybe we should give Chili Jam a chance....
Thanks !
I got double unskippable ads and they both WERE 15s long
How about Indonesia Uncle?
why no tour in the philippines haiyya
Uncle Roger's so weak...
Call him chilli Wonka
hey Uncle Roger, did you know you've been cooking fried rice all wrong? :P https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLtoGNsbbXw
We hate Jamie Oliver here, least everyone ive spoken to
Because of this video I am buying these as my husband‘s birthday gift this month.   Whoever thought of making this Collab deserves a raise and recognition.
0:11 SPRINKLE MSG
America isn’t a white people only country, dear.
Awesome episode Uncle Roger and even better with the CEO bants!!
Wait i thought they were the same person NaNi
Uncle roger you Betrayed me 😭😭😭
12,000-15,000 people got chili jam made by Uncle Roger
Uncle Roger PLEASE review Keef Cooks fried rice, this guy is really extra lol
Why don't you put MSG in the chili jams?
Uncle Roger: *can't lift the sugar* Me: Why so weak? :D
FUUUYIOOO
Waaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit do you actually have a twin???????
Uncle Roger ate to much msg.. week like lettuce 😂😂😂 haiyaaa
You and your couson look like twins
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I already loved trecklments!
Uncle roger: I fear no place or man, but that place, Chilli Jam Factory, It scares me.
There is Native Americans in Canada
"Trigger" warning: do not eat or drink while watching this video! I almost spit my coffee out at one point. Another point I was laughing so hard I choked on some rice. Lol.
I like how uncle roger act like he own that factory and say to that owner like his worker🤣🤣🤣
Whenever I hear chillijam I imagine two slices of toast and in the middle is chillijam
So your twin person is you
Plzz from Indian🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Why I use chili jam 8:07
Is this Pokémon? Because the channel seems to be evolving. Fuiyoh!
if I see trackelmens I will buy 💪💪💪
I'm soo sad now because I'm going to KL in December 10th haaayyiiaa
Owner :- Don’t leak the recipe Uncle Roger :- Uploads it to YouTube
The double cut was almost perfect but the shadows on the desk give it away. I'd suggest lighting more from the split point so less shadows form where it splits. Easier then adjusting the split as things move.
Netted Fedoras for the warehouse 😂😂
you know I wanted to meet uncle Roger but i just remembered that I have school...
Terrible name
waiting u come thailand or kl
You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would destroy the dark side, not join them.                                                 －Obi-Wan on uncle Roger
I'm starting to think "Uncle Rodger" is just a shtick and he doesn't really have a thick accent?
LMAOOO 5:16 this the most cutest thing I've ever seen from Uncle Roger
"jasons gonna tell us how to make it but dont give the recipe away"  *posts it online for millions of people to see*
i thought he would die in there and never come back alive.
in chilli jam have tons of MSG, they just use a different name so their customer don't freak out
I am very happy that an Asian finally taught Western countries how to eat rice. But here I would like to say one thing, that Iranian rice is much tastier than East Asian rice, try it once, especially with chicken stew or kebab . Finally, thank you for all your efforts in making such beauty programs
so trash so trash, uncle roger, haiyah!
why so weak, uncle roger, haiyah
Video was too good almost hit thumbs down lol
Sabah be like:👁️👄👁️
So excited to see you in Tokyo 🤩
I hate uncle roger bc he stereotypes asian people and im asian
Nandos + chilli jam
You're right for this job.
Visit Philippines also ☺️
Guy was such a good sport. They got a new customer.
jamie oliver is in pheaneas and ferb
“it feels wrong" literally every big restaurants,if you avoid MSG that giving you headache then stop taking salt that giving you blood pressure
Totally cool!  So funny!
9:00 when he pulled out the egg fried rice, that was just the cherry on top of this boss’s humor. You can tell he watched at least a little of uncle Rogers vids and can take the hits and give them back.
please try coming to india too next time
The CEO is legend, loved it
Fuiyooooo
that wolf of wallstreet line HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHA
6:38 uncle roger looks like a Yakuza
now i want to taste it, you guys know if that brand is in Spain?
To hell with the sauce...I want to see those bikes!!!
Actually might check out this guys products , such a down to earth CEO.
Nobody :  Uncle Roger :  Mhhhh this hot Chilli sauce got a nice kick to it *punches*
i want this chili jam
Uncle roger look like bts 😂
I like the fedoras
Ain't Bangkok and Thailand the same? I almost got deceived 😆😆
0:38, editor, you fucked up, the shadow…. That’s all I’m gonna say. Wait, that’s not really your fault.
Ask anyone who used to have school meals about Jamie Oliver and you'll get nothing but rage and dislike.
Uncle Roger: When I heard the name “Tracklement”, Uncle Roger thinks it some old lady in cottage The CEO: We’ve been going quite some time now, and that is how it started
This company is smart. They knew Nigel Ng dislike Chilli Jam in Egg Fried Rice and they still let him tour their factory and let him play his Uncle Roger persona. They even gave him fried rice and just play along with his joke. Now millions of people know about this brand and want to try their product.
5:37 ... i thought the CEO would say "Why so weak?"  to uncle
The thumbnail looks like uncle roger is steering lava lol
Gotta say, Kinda disappointed you didn't try the chilli jam with the egg fried rice...
OMG 😱 when are you coming to Bangkok?
Tell me why I thought there were twins on screen 😂 nice job on the announcement
Oh cinta.
Uncle Roger just hated chili jam as soon as he saw it Its because of Jamie Oliver
Is nigel roger?
Uncle roger is nephew nigel real
Can u watch dimslim five star fried rice
why no tour to hong kong haiiyahhh uncle
When the CEO told Uncle Roger to picture the mixture as Auntie Helen, he became cemented as an official Uncle.
Why everyone sees uncle roger blue hair
I AM  malasiya
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4SgTn1TEnQ
Great video!! Now we have to get us some chili jam!! :D   But no worries, we won't put it in our egg fried rice! Haha
I wonder why people don't wear masks in a food-producing factory?
the height difference though 😂😂
Uncle roger just makes my day!
You were supposed to destroy them not join them
owner brought good vibes
Why no Singapore lmaoo
Uncle Roger created the thing he sworn to destroy
I remember back at star headlight I met the CEO and he was the 4th generation owner and a super nice guy, I also met his dad the 3rd gen owner and even though I was let go they treated me like family.
6:29
Uncle Roger should do a Christmas meal with a turkey with a MSG brine!
Halo Halo How you doin

5M subs and do a challenge? Tracklement Chili Jam Fried Rice?

It would be really wierd for next gen chilli if it in thailand so thai people don't need it you just put a 4 or 5 chilli + pepper = your touge getting burnned
Lol hoo yooo
Is it possible because of ne variant?
Bought my ticket for the haiyaaa tour Newcastle venue 19th of march can't wait fuiyooohh
*Jason, help!*
I just had an epiphany. I could never figure out what chilli jam would taste like or even what the eff it is. And when the owner said he went to Bangkok… Now I realize where it was coming from! It is one of those chicken sauces we have, isn’t it!? Ps. You still don’t put it in any kind of fried rice. Never.
So much laughter.  👍
Haiiyah Fuiyohh
I wonder how you handled yourself in the place that reminds you of the British guy you bully imao.
https://youtu.be/Q5D6dfvlRjU
ill just buy MSG by your Local Store then 8-D
Uncle roger you should review Ninong Ry's egg fried rice.
Uncle Roger before visiting chili jam factory: I hate chili jam Uncle Roger after visiting chili jam factory: I will use it as a snack
Why don’t you stop over in Singapore, even though we are enemies.
Oh God are they rinsing or filling machines
Try doing a collab with steven he
sorry children
Uncle Roger I think you need to try you some collard greens with some good ole neck bones
Idk why but the owner is giving off dr nafario vibes
How much did they have to pay you to go to this shitty factory??
6:49 filling machine
hahaha
You either die as a hero or live long enough to become a villain. NEPHEW roger complimenting chili jam.
So disappointed in you Uncle Roger you're only going to Brisbane in Queensland. Jamie Oliver loves it there.  You need to come to Cairns.. Jamie Oliver isn't welcome here.
OMG I love this guy!!!!
I will actually try their chili jam after the video. Very open-minded and humorous CEO
Jaaaaaime, when are you responding to uncle?
UNCLE ROGER, GO SEE NICKS NEW VIDEO! WON'T REGRET
You’re not coming to Atlanta?! Haiyaaa!
https://youtu.be/iKRXIkboIqo
為何不來台灣
I had Wiltshire Tracklement whole seed mustard many years ago. It is World No.1
Legend says Uncle Roger is SUPER IDOL!!!!
TASTE OF REVENGE!
I like how he says why only white people when he's oh so white
5:18 haiya uncle roger so weak
Is it just me or the chili jam CEO lowkey looks and sounds like The professor from Despicable Me ?!?!
Dunno, the pair promotions are not as funny.
now i want Jamie Oliver to visit rice cooker factory
I forget about uncles Rogers actual voice but find it so soothing
I salute jimmy oliver that still stand strong despite uncle roger worldwide roasting..hahha
I really like the attitude and sense of humour of the CEO of Tracklements. Going to head over to their e-shop now and see what wonders they are selling.
but it only takes 2 to fill up ur moms table
Hi uncle Roger I am a huge fan of you could you do a tour at Indonesia because I can't go to another country
Collab with Steven
Going into the belly of the beast
The CEO must had watched all your weejios before the collab. He got so many on the point jokes with you

Uncle Roger and nephew nigel are actually different people?
Hello i'm from thailand 😀

"I call it INSTASHIT" That made my day! xD

Dear Uncle Rodger, I really admire you as a fried rice specialist. You've reviewed fried rice from all over the world. Please add India in that list too  https://youtu.be/P0ullgo0Lnw
3:36 "Usually when people go to Bangkok, they come back with wife, not jam" LMAO

Msg is literally a poison ☠️
Got the ticket!!! See you in 2022 Uncle Roger!!!

I’ve never had chili jam but honestly it sounds gross, if I wanted some sort of chili condiment or whatever I would just use chili paste or oil
5:16 uncle roger cant pick sugar up haiyaaah why so weak? Why so weak?
This was broadcast live. At 5:17, where Uncle Roger asked help to raise the bucket of sugar, the live chat EXPLODED with "so weak! why so weak?" comments. I was crying of laughter!
Sum ting wong

uncle roger roger, can you review indonesia street food
5:36 haiyaa uncle so weak laa 😂🤣🤣🤣
you are required by law that every time somebody says Bangkok you have to tap them in the balls. Get it Uncle Roger? Bang Cock 🤣🤣🤣
After watching this it seems like it's more of a premixed chilli sauce rather than jam. Might give it a try.
Nephew guy:I LOVE SAUCE me:I LOVE SAUCE
How much is your ticket
That’s basically our dipping sauce but with onion instead of garlic. We dip all kinds of fried food in that.
Ha!  My chilli jam has chillies and sugar and that's it!  Add onions and vinegar - that's chutney, not jam.
India, please, come to INDIA
The boss eat too much chilli jam until hurting his troat...and his sound became like this.
Told my best friend to buy msg today and when he went to buy it I called the narcs on him! They arrested him and apologized him to him when the results came! Revenge for putting a chimpanzee pic on my college certificate!
hey ya .what is 'fuyoh' mean?
ได้โปรดขอคำบรรยายภาษาไทย

Please react Marshmello's video Making Nasi Goreng.
Huh. I didn't expect to see the word "chilli" and "jam" together in my life but because of this video, I should've expected it
"I fear no man, but that thing...   **Jammie Olliver's Fried rice**  it scares me."
Visit  ITALIAN CHEF next
How much they pay for that
I like how the hats look like fadoras
Uncle Roger needs to hit a gym!!!! One of my fav vids, great job uncle Roger can’t wait to see you on your us tour.

Brilliant!
Very funny and nice chilli jam
One question, how where there 2 Uncle Rogers 24 seconds into the video?
The CEOs extensive knowledge and witty comebacks towards Uncle Roger is astounding
React to Doobydobap ramen
😂😂😂😂 Epic smashed it
0:52 what how
Uncle Roger really had stir up aunty Helens insides one more time 🤣🤣
Uncle Roger and Guy have such good chemistry just like Nardwuar and Tyler the Creator
I like this niece guy until he said Jamie's green curry taste good. Maybe that's why he doesn't get a Thai wife
Looking forward to seeing you in Australia Uncle!
Just ordered Chilli Jam from them now.
How the turn tables, huh uncle roger??...
saw someone put mustard in rice. came here to cleanse my eyes
how was there two of you
Kiss uncle Roger
Guy sensei
This is the first time looking at this young man, he is Hilarious. YOU ARE HILARIOUS !!!! I LOVE IT...
The employees must be jacked after doing that almost every day for years
i love that he said and of course *pause* KL. because most asian tours come to singapore instead 😂
He looks so small compared to that guy
See Jamie Oliver, don't fight him, join him... Laugh at yourself and move on
I mean.... Ajimoto is pretty much Cocaine for flavor.
I got a ticket for the Glasgow show yayy,excited!
White People Countries 😂😂😂😂😂 dead
I live in KL
But i love sauce
Alright, I really can't be the only one who heard that iconic beat when Uncle Roger was stroking the nigella seed 😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
what a guy
Wow that was a big jump for this company to let Uncle Roger in  great sports!
Haiyaaaa why uncle so lazy, please update everyday if u not lazy
What a cool guy
Haiyaaa...uncle roger is so weakkk.hahaha
Can confirm that I worked at Tracklement for a few months and Guy would often ask us to rub chilli jam all over our overalls so he could eat it off of us while feeling how muscular our arms were. Strong culture of body positivity and friendliness
can you react to the channel tasty where they make a giant version of ramen?
I need chilli jam in Italy too now
NIGELAAAAA CUT YOUR HAIR PLEEEEEASE !! HAHAHHAH
I love tracklements.
Wish i could go to the Nigel show, but he's not coming to Oklahoma 🥺
The Willy Wonka bit was comedy gold. Guy rolled with that so perfectly. I honestly did not expect him to hold his own quite so well. This video was hilarious!
This you have to check out  Uncle Roger ... https://youtu.be/B3CHsbNkr3c It's about rice, you'll love it.
Not gonna lie This makes me want to try some chilli jam in a PB&J sandwhich Savoury and spicy
If it wasn't for all that sugar, I feel like chilli jam might be alright.
Love this!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I like the fact that he always know to save others' career after insulting them.
Hating anything because of Jaime Oliver is completely valid, the man is king sized prat.
Fuiyoh!! Tickets booked for Uncle Roger’s fucking hilarious nephew Nigel in Singapore. We bought a new rice cooker to celebrate. Actually, we did buy a rice cooker a few weeks ago, but it sounded amusing.
Uncle Roger so soy, needs to eat more meat
uncle roger why your voice is soo funny
Haha chili jam factory very cool,jamie oliver sucks
i cant trust him anymore
Great work nige! Loved it and tacklements do make great stuffs. Quality in every jar 👌 Mr CEO earned my respect! ✊

Chilli wonka is chill
He said Bangkok and Thailand 🤣
Looks yummy. Motivated to try some chili jam now.

Make a culab with stevin he
I never once wanted to strike a TV chef before in my life !!!.... Until I seen Jamie Oliver use Chilli Jam in his egg fried rice, I'll have you know that people that do that need to have their privates dragged across broken glass coated with Indonesian Rendang paste !!!
Uncle Roger role-playing an Asian factory worker so well, FUUUUUIIYOOOOOOHHHHH!
woh~~ uncle roger in bangkok
Uncle roger, pls review kichi kichi omurice 😳
NIGELLA SEEDS LMAOOO IM DEAD
Yo I live in Tokyo. How all these entertainers and DJs getting in? Do the same border restrictions not apply? Half the kids in my class are stuck in their countries doing it all online and cant come back to Japan right now.   No shade, just genuinely curious.
this uncle is such a nice person.
I think it is motivated for auntie Helen suddenly she died uncle Roger feels good i will die for you for MSG love you uncle
Another Gem 😂😂😂
Want a collab with steven he
Lol only white people country... uncle Oliver never been to Cali. We stand Asians. Especially at UCLA
Lmao after watching all the uncle Roger's videos, now I want him to react on Oli London's videos. It will be so much fun watching him roast Oli London.
"Bangkok and Thailand..." wait a minute...
Is that special by twice
Not Indonesia uncle roger?
Uncle Roger roasting the CEO hahahaha

Awesome video! The CEO and uncle roger! Thumbs up!!!
*I CHALLENGE UNCLE ROGER TO MAKE FRIED RICE WITH CHILI JAM*

Uncle roger still waiting you to react Mark Wiens Fried RICE
My dad watched this in the car while driving and made me have an internal panic attack
Best episode ever!

The Chili guy seems like a cool person.
I'm glad he still alive and i'm glad the boss enjoy the joke too
Hyena

Didnt expect chilli jam cld be this funny🤣. The owner is a good sport, and is a natural on camera👍

I went on amazon and ordered me a jar of this chili jam (only 18 left for US customers lol).

So excited to see you in New York!!!!
Uncle Roger this is one of your best videos yet! lol Please tell nephew Nigel congratulations on his stand-up career! When you get punched in the face, you have reached "Jim Carrey" level status!
Just the thought of Auntie Helen😂😂😂
Not Uncle Roger struggling 🖐🏽💀😭
ny teacher used uncle roger in a meme for class

So the chilli jam is really from Thailand.

Its not a chill ja0lm factory Its a Jamie Oliver company😂😂😂
"Jason help" SO WEAK SO WEAK
I feel like they should be wearing masks and gloves around the food processing… not for Covid reasons…. just like… sanitary reasons
Weird to see Uncle Roger in my home County, in the best way possible!
Whew! This episode was SPICY! Pun intended.
My mum works here!!
Yo this man is the real life uncle from the Jackie Chan adventures! The catch phrase and all! Hayaa!!!!!! Keep it up 👍🏼
Nephew Guy is a legend, Tracklement has gone to the top of my shopping list
So excited, I now have tickets to see you in Seattle!
Oh man, imagine how much fried rice you can flavor with that! Jamie Oliver would be happy!
Why is the world tour named- haiyya world tour. Should've been "fuyoh world tour".
Uncle roger remember what you said in this video?: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e9WuB0Ua98&t=321s&ab_channel=mrnigelng  (skip to 9:23 at that video)
nigel is older then unc roger to be called his nephew Lol
The chili jam owner was chill. But he admitted that he got the idea for his jam by traveling Thailand. So, why didn't he label the product "Thai Style Sweet Chili Sauce"? And on that point, why didn't Jamie Oliver simply make a Thai style sweet chili sauce himself, and then call it such when he added it to his fried rice? Or better still, Jamie Oliver could have demonstrated a Thai fried rice recipe, then added a commercial brand of Thai sweet chili sauce.  ... However, I'm glad that NONE of that happened, because when Uncle Roger makes fun of Jamie Oliver and Chili Jam, he makes my day! 🤣
8:49 omg uncle roger is a ONCE <3
Can you come to work at VietNam restaurant after covid
This is great. “You don’t give a shit. You kill people you kill people, I like you people”
Lol good to see uncle roger succeed so well from nephew hard work during lockdowns.
Instashit
Sorry Uncle Roger. There's no such word as chilli.
Uncle Roger, that dip you're trying starting at the 9:18 mark is similar to an old Yankee treat, saltines with cream cheese and chutney. It was the weekend treat at the Vassar dining halls when my mother attended there in the 1950s.
Family is the answer to everything
i love the fact Uncle Roger can just walk in there and insult the shit out of the CEO. And Nephew Guy wasn't even that bothered. Love it. 🤣
Not trying to be racist. But Uncle Roger and Nephew Nigel look exaxtly the same.
Come to Rotterdam!
I daré you to give me an IP logger
Is Uncle Roger our version of Borat? 🤔
Uncle, when will you open the tickets presale for Bangkok? 🙌
Guy really deserved the uncle title.
Definitely took inspiration from Thai sweet chili sauce but this looks thicker, plus they use more fancy ingredients like cider vinegar instead of white vinegar. Also, why Uncle Roger so weak he can't even hold the bucket by himself?
Uncle Roger cannot lift a sugar bucket... Why so weak?
THEY BASICALLY FIND THE ENGLISH WORD FOR SAMBAL
Going to try the brand out just because this video made me laugh. The owner and uncle roger def. did a good job with this.
You must be vaccinated to keep traveling.
fun fact for viewers: the smaller the chili, the hotter it is (it depends on what type of chili you are using)
1:57 Uncle Roger : White hat, in Asia we only wear white hat when somebody in family died. .. CEO guy : **awkward laugh**
*Uncle Roger eating the hot chilli jam*  Uncle Roger : "put nice kick to it " * starts to punch *   :))))
Tour of Hong Kong on the horizon?  Home of egg fried rice.  Heiyaa
Screw Chili Jam
*uncle roger lifting the bucket* why so weak why so weak
What about South Africa..
UNCLE ROGER WHEN ARE YOU COMING TO DELHI, INDIA??
I like how they both try not laughing, but want to bust out laughing so hard! This video.. I’m dying
Well I guess MSG factory tour?
Uncle Roger Need His Own Rice Cooker Merch  Especially If It's Glow In The Dark Like The Neon BG in his new house
Uncle Roger should collab with Greg Wallis on inside the factory
Why not SG?
Aaaa in in perlis.....jauh ma dari kl
Chili jam sales after the video 📈📈📈
why no jakarta
Speechless...but very good effort
I wish you go to manila
Where is egypt
Uncle Roger: Got nice kick to it   *Punches air*

uncle roger looks so weak better work out
I genuinely see Uncle Roger and Nigel as two separate people
Bangkok eh? Well I might see u there lemme check my schedule first.

Uncle Roger's worst nightmare- *A chilli jam factory*
An Asian with a big pure white fellow.  Good duo. 💪😅😅
Do a Collab with Steven he plss
I did not expect a CEO to be funny like this. I was ready to roast an uptight, white, male CEO but boy was I sooo wrong 😂 would live to try this chili jam but I live all the way from the Philippines
Haiyaaaa!! haha
Uncle Roger join dock side haiyaa
Uncle... Chilli jam ni... macam sos cili lah kan? Ke... lain?
i still cant get over the "nephew guy"
Got my tickets!
I love that the chilli jam factory made a show with Uncle Roger while Jamie Oliver still keeping mum about everything.
Did you know when you use msg and mix it to the liquor the one who drink it is gonna faint and died and the come-like is gonna comes out of his mouth
respect for Uncle Roger for learning the secret behind chilli jam despite roasting it like there's no tomorrow. Really love both of their sense of humours! They clicked so well this is such a nice change of pace ^^
this nephew is older than uncle... so weird :)
This is branding done right …
Chili jam and egg fried rice was the victim of jamie oliver's cooking, he's the criminial and not the chili jam
“i call it instashit” lol. oh my…lol
Who want to see Uncle Roger making Weejio with Nigella Lawson?
this was good. i might try some chili jam in the future.
unlce roger cannot lift bucket of sugar? so weak
me in Johor be like: So close yet so far :")
ROGER AND NIGEL, PLEASE COME TO SEOUL!!!
I'm a normie and will wait for the public ticket sales XDD
;'mnn
I’m guessing they won’t reply to preserve their secrecy but I’m guessing the red bell pepper is fresh and the chili first boiled down and/or salt cured…can anyone confirm?
I think i am tripping but i heard rod or prim or whatever their names are say that they want to hear the best impressions of uncle roger on mix fm.
Bruhh whatta big balls move. Hes facing his weakness💀
Im gonna follow This company on instashit for the good fibes and REAL GUY remarks!!
Uncle Roger Can't Lift Haiyaaa
The chili jam factory owner....reminds me of Wallace and grommit
Doesn't matter how high you are,   Uncle Roger is Haiyaaa!!
Lol
You guys looks like twins
Haiyaaaaa, this is not jam...jam is sweet, this is call condiment lah 🌚🌚
What will you all think if uncle roger should collab be with
I want to see nephews motorbike collection.
I ask for non-British people. What actually is chilli jam? Is it just a thickened chilli sauce 🤷🏼
somehow reminds me of when conan o'brienvisits the sausage guy😄
he sounds like the general fish from spongebob when he was teaching him how to drive
can you react to Hasean the mickey mouse guy  sorry not good at english
69k likes. Nice. Sorry Children ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
This is hilarious and educational.
5:18 LMFAOOOO HAD ME ROLLING🤣🤣

Don't go in you'll die in there
I’m going to Haiyaa tour at capital mext year
Unker Roger why so weak??? Cannot carry the pail of sugar by urself? 😜
Hold up..hold up... u mean to say that chilli jam is actually supposed to be thai sweet chilli sauce??? My feelings about this is Worcestershire sauce-level complicated...
Uncle roger why so weak when mixing get some of that lol
Go uncle Roger

Uncle roger: It just tastse good    Me: If it just taste good THEN whats better I thought its king of flavor Haiya
Yes Uncle Roger... chilli jam not good. chilli jam for the british people and the british people arent as white as jamie oliver :D
As a children I forgive you Uncle Roger
That was actually super fun :D :D :D :D :D :D :D
Guy was a really wonderful and knowledgeable host!
I started to cook asian food just because of this channel. Much love
Imagine getting super roasted for advertising your product. Nephew guy is a Legend🤣😂
Uncle roger can you review Uncle Joshua ramen
Itz sweet chilli = chilli jam 🤣🤣🤣
Don't you talk to your rice cooker?
Uncle Roger: "its got a nice kick to it" Also Uncle Roger: *casually punches air*  lol wtf
Loved this video…Getting all excited about buying tickets in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada tomorrow… See you next year…💕💕
Uncle Roger talk as hot as chili, but I don't know why I still love him so much 🖐🏻😭
no mask and glove when cooking the chili jam?
I know it's been said a billion and a half times. But I love how much fun the CEO was having with it, and not being afraid to prod Roger gave them such great chemistry!  Thanks for this video! this was a unexpected pleasure! :D
😂😂
oi Got Singapore anot i wanna see
Tokyo too?
6:29
I'm.... legit gonna buy some fuckin chilli jam now. lol
hahahahah WHITE HAT!
This channel slowly becoming laptop si unyil
You should try 老干妈(lao gan ma)
Lao Gan Ma
Wait, so uncle roger has a twin? Or it was edited? Someone pls explain🥲
9.10 in thailand we hate him
I've never had chilli jam before is it good with toast bread?
LOL You can tell Nephew Guy is a fan the second he brought up Auntie Helen.
I'd try some chilli jam...
Uncle Roger is visiting where his worst nightmare is made
I hope I get tickets to Nigel/Uncle Roger show here in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. That would be AWESOME. But seriously I had to pause the video and laugh for 5 minutes cause I could not believe the title 🤣🤣
This is Guy  Movie flashbacks
Hey uncle roger, who is your bias in TWICE?
“JASON HELP” 😂😂 I can’t idk why that’s so funny to me
Listen I'm sure Chilli jam tastes just fine.  Time and place
wait I thought Uncle Roger and Nephew Nigel were the same guy, bruh
Haiyyyaah why dont go to Indonesia???
Dear Uncle Roger, I recommend you to view ‘tiny cakes’. Tiny cakes is mini version of cooking. Although there might not be MSG the king of flavour in there, there is wok and real fire! No induction stove! I think uncle Roger would be proud! The things in there are also very cute! Some materials are made out of recycled materials. Please view it!
"Most people come back from SEA with a wife" "I like my sauce"  Uncle Trackleman is lost in the sauce.
i like the guy - he's got sass and dry british humor.
Uncle Roger dont have the strength to work in a factory >.>
That guy was such a good sport it was great to see. Honestly he alone makes me want to support their brand.
1:43 "SO WEAK YOUR BRAND NAME"  🤣😂🤣 Uncle Roger is savage!!! Hahahaha his mouth is unstoppable
Wait can anyone answer me that theres a twin or only Nigel
Tullberg is great in this - such a good sport! Fun episode!
"don't give the resipe to other people" Bruh now everyone watching uncle Roger vids now they know the recipe
Bangkok
Uncle needs milk
Nephew Guy had great comedic chemistry with Uncle Roger. I think he should be made Uncle Guy one day.
Please bring us back Rice to meet you Podcast.!!
Enjoyed the tour Nigel!
GOOOO TO THE PHILIPPINESSS TITO ROGERRRR
I still cant get over the fact that the person’s name is Guy
Uncle Roger is a great host ngl
Super neat! :)
nevber thought there would be a guy name guy
We saw the filling machine but where is the rinsing machine?
WHAT!!!???there is another uncle roger!!!??Is that true????
4.15 why he have to say it like that 😭
How many times did I say, "STFU, Uncle Roger" in this weejio?  Too many.....   Nephew Guy is not JO.  Treat him with respect.  He at least brings much needed flavor to the British Isles.
WHY THERE IS NO SHOW IN JAKARTA ?
BRING BACK THE DISLIKE BUTTON!
Sorry Uncle Roger I'm gonna have to buy chill Jam, it looks yummy.......
why i can't find Bangkok ticket haiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I like this boss. So funny and humorous like Uncle Roger. No awkward moments. You guys talk like friends.
Uncle roger 1million views in 1 day!
Lol, the best conversation you can ever have is with yourself.

I WISH you would visit the uae
I love Jalapeño jelly.
Canada? Where in canada?
Eh, I made the mistake of buying Jalapeno Jam.  It tasted like sad, Haiyaa!
Are u going to go to Vietnam
No India tour?😓
Rip dislike button
You need to review doobydobap's Ramen!
😂😂 Nephew Nigel still scared of going back to Singapore after making that dictatorship joke 😅
Go to MSG factory next time
Man this make me want to get chillie jam from Tackleman

NO WAY THIS HAS A FRICKING *FILLING MACHINE*
*I dare uncle Roger to eat at Jaime Oliver’s restaurant*
This is so wholesome! Giggled my way through the entire video..
Why u visit  ur nightmare
Uncle Roger is giving Mr. Rogers vibes in this one! I love seeing how stuff is made.
5:19 Jason was like: “*Why so weak, so weak?*”
Oppps uncle roger what about philippines,, we are your fans too, we are jelous we're not on the lists! AAYYAAAA
This is nice and funny 😁
i used to like chili jam, its actually real good
Jamie Oliver is the secret investor for chilli jam 😂
I love how there is no dislike
The title alone sent me.
Smart PR move! Now i wanna try it😂👍
6:28
Lol
Chilli jam can be a force for good, if not used as a weapon of massdestruction on poor innocent egg fry rice
Ill be honest....i might give them a fair try after seeing this...good work to both brands Unce Roger and Tracklements. Some off thier others sauces look like fire.
5:36 lost it hahahaaha
Uncle roger looks great in the uniform lol
no wonder...it's -  Chilli Jamie Oliver
DIU LE LOU MOU UNCLE CHAU HIE.
Comedy gold
this video was so funny
COVID masks
Bro he ain't Willy Wonka he chilly chonka
Uncle Roger on First We Feast, please!
Lol
I feel bad for you uncle roger for someone to use chilli jam on Asian food! Haiyyyya! 😫
They should make How It's Made except with Uncle Roger as the narrator/host!
Why do they wear fedoras lmao?? 🤣🤣
luv your videos bro keep doing this ❤️‍🔥
This video was fantastic.  Nephew Guy was lots of fun.   Looks like a nice clean place that makes a lot more than I ever imagined.
With all your racist comments, it makes sense that you got punched in the face
...... Heads to supermarket for chili jam... ......
What about African cities? Haiyaaaaa!
Really very good and fun video.... I like Guy he's so cool to put up with Uncle Roger antics... One of the best videos... Fun educational and good chemistry together Well done both Uncle Roger and Guy of Trackelman ❤️
Packing Nan's burn was the best.
That had to have been fun dude.  I would have loved to see what was too bad for the blooper reel, because you know it happened and it would have been funny as hell.
Looks like we need an "Uncle Roger Approved" sauce from Tracklements ASAP.  One that has all the trimmings, peanuts, MSG & halal BBQ pork on the ingredients list.
Nephew Nigel and Uncle Roger are awesome! Hoping to see you when you come to the USA!
I was dying at this video. Uncle roger  is a fukin pimp
I wasn't sure what to expect when we started this video, but it was wonderful! The CEO and Uncle Roger were a magically funny duo. Fuiyou!! I am looking how to buy their products outside of the UK.
Congratulations Nigel, as a fellow comedian I can appreciate and recognize all the work you put into your career to get a tour set up
Uncle Roger is a guy that can talk crap with the CEO and go scott free with a free meal.
Uncle roger no like Jamie Oliver because he use chili jam on all thing. But uncle roger just like jamie oliver but always use msg
you could do a whole show with that guy hey bahahahahahahaha
How many children have gone missing here?   I’ve lost count.    I’m ded
Brand vs Brand
You inspired us Uncle Roger. Bought our first bag of MSG today. Gonna sprinkle some one the turkey for Thanksgiving here in Washington.
Loved this video!
Any Irish dates?
Uncle Roger should react to the eating challenges on I'm a celebrity get me out of here 🙂
You talk alot about england...but can you handle new England cooking. The sea food is calling you.
That face 2:31 - 2:35 , uncle Roger so cute! 🥰
Singapore for World Tour?
"I've lost count cause we put them in here" points to massive cooking pots xD
“Yeah but I love sauce”   🤭
😆😆😆
Oh no!! Uncle Roger couldn't lift up the bucket!! So weak! So sad!
The owner is hilarious! I love how he already knows all the references uncle roger makes
The sauce clearly had some kick 👊 to it
5:16 Haiyaa... Uncle Roger so weak... so weak!
Chili jam absolutely has a place ; it's just not where Jamie Oliver puts it Xd
I started doubting life when he sayed he loved Jame oliver
Love CEO bloke. Is he married?
Nephew Guy- I love SAUCE
The CEO was very cool, that was a fun video.
It couldn’t get worse because it chilli jam factory and now there no MSG!
Uncle’s accent is getting better.  Nephews are getting sadder.
How can Nigel be so handsome and his uncle not be ? What is going on there ?
GroovyRamon X “Just loook at it!!!”
Haiya uncle roger to weak
The CEO was great! Loved this
I mean at least it is not strawberry jam
So funny hope to see more of these kind of videos in the future!
It's amazing he met the CEO of a chilli Jam factory!  Really I wonder how he made this happen!  And he didn't ask the most important question! What is Chili Jam meant to be used for?!
Uncle roger just goes and roast them all
Amazed and funny 🤣
Uncle Roger come to India your always welcomes you ❤️❤️❤️
I actually like a fried egg sandwich with Chilli Jam...but never in egg fried rice!
I love the way you think Canada is not an Asian country! When was the last time you were here?
Hey Siri, please add Tracklements Chilli sauce to my shopping list.  Great video.
“Instashit”. I like him.
Uncle Roger has 6 packs but couldn't pour that bucket of sugar ? So weak!
So do u approve of chilly jam so can i use it on my fried rice now uncle roger
Jamie Oliver: Let’s hope this video is not about me  Uncle Roger : Haiya u clown prince of cooking bad
Why do you hate white people so much?
I REALLY don’t mean to sound racist or anything, but are those 2 asian people in the beginning the same person?
Haiyaaaa...Uncle Roger could barely hold a 10 kilo bucked of chili... Why so weak? WHY SO WEAK?
Is uncle roger and Nigel are twins or just one person?
HAIYAAH, why no LA?
Would love to see more of this " factory tours" definitely  lol
Haiyaaa
"has a kick to it." ::throws punch:: 🤣🤣
who reads this, be happy and healthy <3 <3
Oh snap! Uncle roger just tricked us into watching a 12-minute ad for chili jam.
Loved it mate. Keep on making my day like that 😅
Uncle Roger and Nephew Nigel are different people? I always thought it was just a role play!
You guys know why he won't go to China? because he gotta have 21 days quarantine for that LOL
0:30 Do uncle Roger know that in Africa Asian people are also white? The only diferece whith the Europeans is in the eyes.
The first thing i thought when i saw Guy was Boris Johnson lmao
The green Pedo would approve of this factory, except no Asian children working there.
so I work at a cake factory and always ask myself: WHO BUY ALL THIS CAKE? 🤣🤣  soo relatable Uncle Roger
I see an uncle Roger vid in my notification.  * I click.  I see an uncle Roger vid with the CEO of a chili jam.  * I smash the like button and literally share the link to my uncle, auntie, nephews and nieces.
Jam Wonka -"Don't share the recipe" Uncle Roger -"List's every ingredient and measurements of said ingredients out loud"
"ive lost count"
I try the link but it’s not working when I choose Canada
5:17 Haiyaa! Why so weak? SO WEAK!  hahahahaha
Uncle Roger! Blink Twice and Wink Once Each Eye if you're being held against your will and being forced to make this video! Do you need help?!
Uncle Roger, why only 1 weedjo for every two weeks?!?  WHAT SO LAZY?!? WHY SO LAZY?!?   Uncle Roger needs at least WEEKLY WEEDJO!!  Why get niece and nephew so addicted not make more weedjo?  Only Poor persons take two weeks to make weedjo!!  DO BETTER!!! DO BETTER!!  It’s funny when you do other things but you need to still do the food reactions!!  Just do two weedjo that week!!
Haiyaa Uncle Roger why you seem so weak..
This was such a great collab and it was really great to see how the staff at the factory were so chill with Uncle Roger just roasting them (and with them occasionally roasting back). And it definitely showed that they knew his brand when they brought in the fried rice XD
5:17 So weak
😂😂😂
uncle Roger so weak
Holland
10:08 that laugh was the biggest insult
Hey Uncle Roger, be careful with  Carelezz Whisperz, people have their whole video claimed just by singing it!
I actually buy this brand a lot...they make the best mint sauce and apple sauces too
From shitting on Jamie Oliver, to egg fried rice review. This channel have it all.
damn I love condiments
Only America tour :/
Sauce!  he ceo loves sauce anime fans we got him
Sambal is happy 😊
one of the best episode, got a lot of laugh
I actually love the owner he is hilarious and takes those jokes with ease.
South Africa when you  coming xD?
NICE UNCLE ROGER, VERY NICE
This CEO was hysterical! I really didn't expect him to have such chemistry and riff with Nigel so well
The comic + straight man combo was unexpectedly funnier than it should be. Well done!
Chilli jam approve?
Thanks as well as being hilarious I have a new fresh natural condiments and sauce brand to try! Great work to help recover their loss of income following your trolling of chillie jam 🤣
If you are coming to Canada, I have a feeling you will be going to BC and or TO…Montréal is for Francophones mostly, and that unfortunately is a deterrent for people in the entertainment field… Sux for me! You know, it costs more for an airline ticket to BC from Montréal than to the UK. With that said, I would MUCH rather wait to see you in the UK than my own country! HAIYAA! :P
Why not INDIA ? why not Haiyaaaaa
uncle roger so weak , cant even lift a bucket . sad life
i cant go to uncle roger i live in terenganu not kl😭🤧
Please export Tracklements to my local supermarket over here in Europe. Love to try it!
Come to Taiwan also, PLEASE~~~~
Uncle Roger and Nephew Guy bike riding video when?
No Hong Kong?
why no come singapore!
They should add a disclaimer on the jar that this product is not suitable for making egg fried rice.
Yummy!!!
Oh damn I actually know this brand lmao I used to work at an expensive grocery store and this brand was there lol really pricey for its size
Uncle Roger's a ONCE.
This guy was great. I don't need chili jam but I could use a jar of proper English mustard or two. Wonder if he ships to the states
When is uncle joger go to Indonesia
Come to germany as well please!!
What the hell Uncle Roger where's India now, isn't it in Asia?????
i just realized i have a box of MSG at home-
5:35 so wik! So wik!
Jamie Oliver will get the chillie jam uncle roger just made
Uncle roger why so weak you scared chili jam
Uncle Roger watch uncle Doobydobap Ramen video!!!!! :)
Holy shit, he's so tall
3:35 aha traveling  sounds like a sex tourist
who tf is the one selling him sausage rolls to make that comparison
You made my day 🤣❤👏
6:40 you were supposed to destroy them not join them.
so you went to KL and not even going to visit jakarta ?
Someone tell huggbees about the filling machine
where's india
Uncle Roger needs some teaching
Nephew Guy: "Just imagine Auntie Helen in there" Uncle Roger: M O T I V A T E D
That guy is having fun having uncle roger with him. I enjoy it too
I wish Uncle Roger would call Jamie Oliver "Jamie Olive Oil" like he used to...it made me crack up every time
HAIYAAA!!!
I was asking myself the exact thing... “Why only white People countries”
where's Latin America in your "world tour" huh? no love for your Latino nieces and nephews? :(
How come there's no Bangkok, Thailand in your lives ticket section? 🤔🤔🤔 Heard you mentioned that.
5:41 cracked me up!
OmG I laughed through out the entire video😂😂😂😂
Chilli Jam is kryptonite to Uncle Roger
Uncle Roger you said Thailand but in the ticket choosing there's no Thailand BKK
Thank you so much for sharing uncle Roger
有机会来老干妈看看
Uncle Roger can't lift bucket of sugar.... Haiyaaaaaa "So weak... So weak..."
I'm sure behind scene they begged him because he crushed there buisness🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
come to PH uncle rogerrrrr
why no philippinessss :'((((
Good episode.
哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈
Hayah! Why no African country 😢 also.
Uncle roger became the very thing he swore to destroy “chilli jam” Wait he became chili jam  No wait  ………
"You were the chosen one! It was said that you would destroy the chilli jam, not make it!"
You should review the fried rice/ramen (or any asian dishes he makes for that matter) of the channel "My Name Is Andong". He definetly should earn the title of uncle! He's also a big promoter of MSG.
Hahaha cili jem
Uncle roger needs to work out
The batch he made should be limited edition ones. :D
No stad-up date in Italy, Zio Ruggero so sad MANNAGGIA!
what a great show.
"Pirated version of Heinz Ketchup" got me off guard
ehhhh are you seriously coming to tokyo?? if its , please let me know ill be sure to signup lollll
That's why they called it jam. They use sugar...
Uncle Roger, don't go to serious businesses, it's just embarrassing for you...
PLEASE COME TO SOUTH AFRICA ONE DAY :(
So racist
I actually love nandoes chilli jam drizzled over my egg fried rice.
He is doing labour for free
https://youtu.be/hfx4lsDg8R4
I repeated the word Bangkok 10 times to tell myself that it’s not a hallucination and Uncle Roger will be in Thailand 🇹🇭 I’m looking forward to that day ❤️
Guy was a great sport as was Uncle Roger! And for what it's worth, the Tracklements brand is approved by my Anglophile friends here in the states. I bet they are seeing an uptick in sales thanks to Uncle Roger so good for them!
Please send some to Malaysia bro.. 🤭
Why don't you imagine it's aunty Helen in there. Hahaha, I'm dead
Cameraman hit something, CEO: OMG are you alright? U.Roger: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Instashit 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wow can't believe it's already a year since first rice video
No MSG?!?! I don't want to go anywhere if I can't bring the king
I now want to try chilli jam.
He called grandpa Guy nephew haiyaaaa
Tracklements has gift sets Fuiyoh!
Thanks for showing how to make this.  I am now making chili jam in my basement.  :-)
Taste of revenge... HAHAHA
Lao Gan Ma factory 👍🏽
Touching the spices, asian check ✔️🌶
But MSG make show better. 🙃
The older uncle Roger the hotter he gets
Vote for twice!
Gonna probably be first to say who else thought uncle roger dyed his hair to blue
"....Jason.......help..."   I laughed too hard at this part 😂
"Youre brand so weak..." in CEO face 😁 I know it might have been set before, but still its epic 😁
U dont show in jakarta?
Seriously, you are a man who came to BKK and came back with chili sauce but you said Jamie's green curry is good?  You better bring back a wife.
5:15 Uncle Roger cannot lift bucket SO WEAK
No.  They usually come back with gonorrhea from Thailand.
Pure marketing brilliance but uncle Roger, it was hard watching you pour in and stir the ingredients. Why so weak, uncle Roger?Why so weak?
Holy grail batman I "F"ing didn't know if they were twins or sisters loljk
Guy Tullberg and uncle roger they were fun :D
CEO YOU GOT YOURSELF A DEAL, NOW IM ORDERING
cries in europe
KL, Malaysia! FUIYO
MALAYSIA LETSSSSSS GOOO MALAYSIANS UNITE
Haiyaaaaa..... So sad.... I thought in your world stand up tour, you included Indonesia...... Come to Indonesia Uncle........ 😭😭😭 I will  give you unlimited amount of msg for free .......
Uncle Roger thumbnail is good enough for us to click and like!🤣
Wonder why he didn’t burn it down
no disrespect to nephew guy but he be making that donald trump confused face😂- 10:30 - 10:34 (''I call instagram instash*t)
Nice episode.  Very nice and humble owner n staff. Nice n clean working environment
Haiyaa its good enough u need phropah Chili Jham
Now we all want to try that chilli jam... Hahaha😁😁
Chilli jam and Uncle Roger? This chilli jam must be something else then
The first time I notice Jamie Oliver using Chili Jam I was like "What????". Then suddenly I think of one of my country (Thailand) ingredient "Nam Prik Pow" which I don't know the name in english. So I google it out and find out the english name for Nam Prik Pow was "Thai Chilli Jam" lol.
Uncle roger don’t even use OG rice cooker he use the new type HAIYA
Uncle roger, why no philippines????
i was today years old when i realized Uncle Roger had a twin… i thought he just changed clothes for all those skits
Backsoundnya serasa nonton mancing mania 🤣🤣🤣
Imma buy this chilly jam only caz of the CEO.
"got nice kick to it" *Demonstrates punching*
endgame
Uncle Roger looks like a factory Raiden.
Uncle Roger: literally shit on Chilli jam Chilli jam company: look at this nice man, let’s give him a tour yo
I love how the CEO just like follow the flow with Uncle Roger..  What a fun guy!
You missed a white people country! Are you coming to New Zealand?
i think he will offend alot of people
wait so they are 2 separated ppl ? i though they are one
aww hell nah wth man
Uncle roger visit chili jam= Uncle roger visit hell        Sorry kids
It really made.me laugh this one. Thanks for that.
I remembered that uncle roger said, he will try to cook chicken in the soil like girl cooked chicken at her office
Nigel is so small
Why is uncle Roger so weak? We need a help me Jason T-shirt.
man, the ceo was actually a really nice guy. Good luck tracklements
You went to Jamie Olivers house?
come to singapore please
Tokyo! Huiyoh, uncle Roger coming to non English country! It’s a good chance for Nigel improve his English more like an Asian!
Of all the business I see interact with a comedian this guy has nailed it. Props to him and the company.
Aunty Helen dumped Uncle Roger for a stronger man
They kacau it like dodol walao wehh
One up for Guy's staff 💪 , unfortunately not so for Uncle Roger.🤣
Wht a cool ceo🥰😍😘
is it halal?
Chiiiiiiiiiiiilli jammmmm
Uncle roger roast chili jam then becomes an endorser hahahahahhahah
This is the proper way to handle bashing! Well done!
Great viejo, nice factory they have there. Great video love your stuff.
why so weak? why so weak uncle roger? XD
Now, i want to try chilli jam
not allowed to bring msg? not a problem mix it in water and bring a portable stove
Uncle Roger is so annoying, LOL
？？？？lmfao
Unlce Roger should've brought a bag of MSG then just casually just put it in there xD
Uncle Roger so weak. Couldn't even carry a 10kg SHU Ga
Hey can you come to Nepal
other white powder笑死
The Company getting almost 1 million views from this video as of now: We just got more customers
wait do they need to wear a mask or they don't have to?
He's a nice guy is Guy.
Why No Singapore??
Uncle Roger mixing Chilli Jam while thinking about Jamie Oliver's screwed up Egg fried rice and Chilli Jam used in it.
Very fun, chili jam has it's place but not on fried rice! I hope you make it over in my direction, would love to see your stand up!
Why didn't you wear mask or gloves at the factory?! 😩
Alternative title: Uncle Roger having fun with his worst nightmare for 11 minutes and 45 seconds straight.
Seriously Great Video!   I was disappointed though that the High Point of the video COULD HAVE BEEN a cameo Jamie Oliver appearance with appropriate reparte’!  Oh Well,  Missed Opportunities!  LOL!
man said US then tried to call it a white person country
Almost a million people have watched this. I can't imagine how much business tracklements is getting now
Ajinomoto factory when?
uncle Roger lifting the sugar. why so weak , why so weak
I born in thai but I don't see any chilly jam???what
That chili Jam has almost has as many ingredients raw in it as i have raw in me
Chilly jam is not in thai
did you have to change back to your normal accent or just maintain the racy accent to not be awkward
30 years old Uncle roger calling a big ass Grandpa "Nephew"
Top kek, of course I put MSG in my carbonara 1. Parmesan 2. Guanciale both contains naturally MSG...
2:10 i thought his hair color changed lol but blue hair maybe fit on him nvm orange better for uncle
Great episode; although the audacity to subtitle Guy and not Uncle Rodger 🤣
Uncle Roger, nephew josuee can not see any US date yet. Make me feel like when taste wegetables. Sad.
Jeeze uncle Roger, do you even lift??
Uncle roger is so funny when he's roasting an industry 🤣🤣🤣
This guy look like every uncle in the UK at once - Jokes aside, loved the different style vid and loved how the tour guide went along with everything
Cute ad for a product I will never buy no matter how 'fun' the brand CEO is. Thank you for the reminder of how thin the line is between content and advertising these days  :/
At first i thought chilli jam is something like sambal in a jar but today i know they're different. It seems more delicious than the one at Jamie Oliver video btw😂
ngl this is a good location for a field trip
5:15 "Why so weak? Why so weak?!"
Why no Hong Kong WHY WHY????????
I wanna buy and taste all off that Tracklement flavour.
26th is my birthday :))
i think, I starting to like "chilli jam"
if Uncle roger goes fully in marketing i might stop looking at his videos...
When help was needed with the sugar bucket, seems that an immediate reply of "why so weak, so weak" was missing. lolz
She on cocaine but she still such a nice person 🤣🤣
why he is the white version of shaq this guy
I love how Sir Guy laughing even uncle Roger roasting his company😂
Uncle Roger has been corrupted by the jam... I think they put uncle Roger inside jam and replace him to talk good of chilly jam.

Uncle Roger:Jason Help!!
I love how the people and products Uncle Roger shat on had pretty much done an uno reverse card.. Aunty Hersha,  Chilly Jam.. JAMIE OLIVER THERE IS STILL HOPE FOR YOU LOL
Now I feel like trying some chilli jam
Why no chilli jam in KL?? I wanna try this after watching your vid
Uncle Roger Chilli Jam
I'm just waiting till this show has that Kimmel-Damon relationship
安安
I normally don't like videos like these. But tbh this is a super nice company, you can see the guy honestly likes what he is doing. I'm in Bosnia but I'd love to try your chili jam, Mr Motorbike Collection. :D
Uncle Rogerif you come to thailand Please don't wear that orange shirt. because it will make you look like a monk (พส)
Tracklements’ motive : don’t give a shit. You kill people, you kill people.
Now I need me a set of Tracklements condiments
The CEO actually having fun with this made this so much better.
Uncle Roger, why you ignoring the fact that MSG is naturally in many foods like soy sauce, anchovies, mushrooms, aged cheese, and tomatoes!
The guy sound like trump
this is the only video where the cameraman got hurt
chili jam from bangkok?... and uncle roger isn't surprised? I think he enjoyed chili paste and make his own thing, and its somehow called chili jam xD Other than that, boss man and uncle roger fit.
Nephew Guy is funny! the way he look at Uncle Roger... LOL
In china we have a wise phrase  that solve all problem If you cannot defeat the enemy ,just join them
Kocak banget ni orang wkwkwkwkkwk..🤣🤣🤣🤣
Absolutely loved their vibe! I wonder if we have them here in Singapore
To me, this isn’t really like chili jam.  It’s more like salsa for chips to me.
Where is India among Asian country list!!!! Y, Y , Haiyyyaaa☹️‼️
Guy was hilarious! Great video, and they come across as a solid business, I hope they get a boost because of it.
Now that I know there's missing children in the jam I gotta buy it
Love it when people can take some humor. This guy turned what could have been a negative into a brilliant marketing move.
I'm also not a fan of chilli jam but this factory is lit & Mr. Willy Wonka seems to be a really genuine guy....so Fuiyoh ~ that I suddenly wanna grab a jar...
me from thailand
Nephew Nigel & Uncle Roger should part their hair different ways ;)
Yes. Can't wait for see you at Melbourne, Australia
i see that tiny split in the table of the two twins
0:37 Ha Noi too....
I use my wok sooooo much that if you see it you will know that i use it
That Guy passed the vibe test!
this was funny
Nigel saying “KL” makes me feel home. Like non-Malaysians would be saying “Kuala Lumpur” but he says “KL”
Gatau kenapa om2 roger suka bgt ama nigella lawson kalaw gw c lbh milih farah quinn
Uncle Rogers heat is too much for chili jam
where your mask
why not come to Taiwan? haiyaa
That chilli guy looks pretty chill
I have recently gotten into his channel and I love the content he has and I also love that it's like an act. Can appreciate all of it, and also love that he adds k-pop songs just randomly. Love uncle roger but not like that or maybe.....😏
How come their eyes is not teary on the cooking area? When my mom cooked spice thing in the kitchen, I usually already sneeze in the living room.
Hm
When you put your hands at the back, you look like my old uncles 😆 Asian here ✋
Uncle roger can you eat eggfried-rice with tomato sauce
wtf can mention KL but not kuching ;-;
This is what we called international paid review. What a massive congratulation Uncle Rodger!
This man has all Jimin's lost jams
Is it available in Aldi?
Just laughed most part of the video.
anyone from ASEAN?
Weit nephew Nigel is a dif person
India? Uncle Roger! India?!
I thought this guy was pretty bland, a bland chili jam man. But then the children comment.
5:18 "Why so weak!? So weak!!" 😂
0:42 stonks*
Will Uncle Roger finally add chilli jam in his food?
dont bring msg, dress up as msg.
next weejio with Nigella Lawson
Is this the only place you see squirting! Uncle Roger you're mad!
Uncle Roger sold out, he's now a chili jam spokesperson...... Fuiyoh
Among a huge variety of factory, why chili jam? LMAO 🤣🤣 Uncle Roger know how to shake our belly 😆
uncle roger i am sad cause you cannot visit every country (i mean if i were i would probally visit every place on earth and the moon but ok) like your video btw
yo come to Guam while your in asia - its super cheap to fly there from Japan, add a show date, people will dig your humor here.
No jakarta? Are you have no dare to sasa msg turf?
coincidentally im watching this while eating sweet chili on rice
Why only one show in singapore... confirm sold out. At least shd have two!!!
"How many children disapper in your factory" "I've lost count, because we just put them in here" Hahahaha  Wait——
uncle roger so weak
No Singapore tour? 🙁
pakcik ni sempoi lah... hahaha
Come to New Zealand
Looking at the ingredient, isn't that just similar to sambal bawang?
no offense, but i thought the CEO sounded like Trump a lil
Unfortunately, I lived in Johor
Why u suddenly dress like fish monker hhaahahahah😂🤣🤣🤣 it taste of REVENGE😂
This kinda reminds me of the Conan sketches where he fucks around at factories and such. Hope to see more if these in the future!
finally a real world tour not  world tour=america
Uncle roger hurting himself just by being there. So sad :(
Uncle roger i wonder how you lift your lady you cant even lift a 10kg chillies properly. *Sorry children*

Owner: Don't give our sauce recipe Uncle Roger: Tells us all the ingredients with volumes. Let's make some chilli jam people.
"Nephew Guy why you insult me?" *spends whole video insulting Guy*
I still can't believe the fact that uncle roger has a twin
See, Nigel and his Uncle are two different people.
this is the longest and only ad I've seen on youtube
Uncle Roger meets How It's Made. Hilarious video and now curious about chili jam. I only ever eat chili paste
I like how this dude clearly had fun doing this interview
I’d like to see Uncle Roger further redeem chilli jam from its ignominious appearance in Jamie Oliver’s video by making his own nam prik pao and then using it as a base for a nice Thai stir fry in a future video. Sweet, spicy, flavourful - delicious!
4:42 why ? why not Taiwan “WHY?”
damn uncle Roger is expanding.
0:55 nigel kind of lets out the uncle roger vibe when he says "stop" XD
why not india?!
I never heard about chilli jam in Thai, is this recipe really from Thai?
I love how guy responds to uncle roger
Nephew Guy:Just imagine Aunty Helen inside there. Uncle Roger:I GOT STRENGTH
Breaking news, chilli jam factory is currently in flames after an unknown individual set the factory in a sea of flames
if your job requires talking to jars u f*** up
pls come to india
Stand up tour in Australia FUIYOOOOOOHHHHHH!!
Chili jam makers gave Uncle Roger an offer he could not refuse.
Im intrigued in trying this chilli jam
Uncle Roger: "How many children disappeared in your factory" The Chilli Jam Willy Wonka: "I've lost count, because we just them in here"
lmao that egg fried rice lunch reveal 👌
I want to buy chilli jam after watching this …
What happen?  You go to Perth, you go to Melbourne. You not stop in Adelaide, haiyaa. You fly right over. Why you not stop and say hello to Adelaide?
Oh, now uncle Roger sort of Master chilli jam. more professional than Jamie Oliver.

Bangkok? Wow

Uncle roger : "Its heavy"  Jason : Why so weak? Why so weak?
Why so weak?  *Why so weak???*   *Only 20 kg HAIYAAA*
where u go at KL im leave at KL im a big fan i want to see u
Uncle Roger can't carry bucket of sugar and that's why Aunty Helen left him
sorry uncle roger, but for 11:45 minute you just make me so anxious because why don't you and factory people wear a mask?
This was so wholesome.  Love it
uncle roger why you not scrape the side of the bucket with the chillies? haiyahhhh you white washed.. always wasting food. haiyahhh.
Loved the CEO!!!
Haiyaaa why no African country on your world tour, world tour not complete
"no, no I can do it"
Uncle Roger comes today with an important lesson for all his nieces and nephews.  Don't hate the chilli jam for the crime.  The chilli jam was an innocent victim, just like the egg fried rice.
kl heck yeah
Uncle Roger need help from Jason to lift sugar. So weak. So weak!
Collecting stamps... Lol what an ancient hobby. XD
no gloves, wtf is wrong with england
Why dont you go to MSG factory Uncle Roger?
I love Uncle Roger's accent and the way he talks with his hands.  And how have over 430 people come in here and given it thumbs down?! HAIIYAA! :(
I found why aunt left uncle roger....
Trending!
The "sorry children" is starting to bother me a lot.
How much did they pay for a 12min ad on a 4,56 million channel?
Whatever  I love uncle roger
0:52 lol who would bring MSG to the show?? 100% that uncle roger will bring MSG
This shit went too far
Uncle Roger need to hit gym next time before roasting chilli jam 😂

Uncle Rodger has just re-invented 'how it's made' for genz

Let's look for chilli jam in malaysia next.
Uncle Roger, please come Hong Kong too.... I will prepare MSG for you.....
Fresh belachan is the best lah.
Hahahaha -- this one was amazing. This nephew was super funny!  Luckily there was a Jason to help out!
I wonder how many people got confused by seeing uncle roger and nigel as a different person
DID I HEAR AUSTRALIA?!

Why I watch sponsor video till the end 😂😂

No Netherlands hiyaaaa
Dear Uncle Roger, please come to Jakarta too, we want to watch your stand-up comedy show
Heaven and hell are two very real literal places. And we all deserve Hell because we all have sinned and fall short of God's glory (Romans 3:23.) Nobody is righteous, nobody is sinless, and God will justly give us what we deserve by casting us in Hell for eternity where there is no rest. But even though we deserve Hell, God is still gracious and loving to us. He sent his only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to give us another chance. Jesus lived a perfect sinless life, He was tempted in every way as we are yet He never sinned. He paid the price for our sins when He was crucified and died a horrible death. Isaiah 53 says His appearance was disfigured beyond that of any man and His form was marred beyond human likeness. Jesus suffered to take the punishment we rightly deserve. Then, He was buried for 3 days, but He conquered death and rose again on the 3rd day. Jesus offers you the free gift of Eternal Life. He wishes that all would come to Him, and He will never turn you away. If you simply believe that Jesus did die for your sins and rose again on the 3rd (1 Corinthians 15 1-4) , and if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart God raised Him from the dead (Romans 10:9-10) then you are saved. No matter what you have done, Jesus loves you, He wants you to accept His free gift of Eternal Life. Now, you're probably laughing at me right now and scoffing, but I only say this because even though I don't know you, I love and care for you. I don't want you to end up in Hell. You know in your heart that this is true, Jesus is Lord. Don't suppress the truth, your eternity is at stake. Please just think about it.   Revelation 3:20 "Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with him and he with me." Revelation 22:17 "Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life."
This guy has the power to insult people and not get kicked out of their place...
that "yeah maybe" at the end make me go 🤣🤣🤣
Do Jamie olivers Christmas advert.
We all know he is only dissing jamie oliver cause he likes the guy and hoping he will see uncle roger.
"visit CHILLI JAM FACTORY"? More like "Uncle Roger dissing Jamie Oliver for 10 minutes straight"
Was amazing video. Love the fried rice throw.
Come to India. We have MSG here :)
6:37 Chili Jam Nephew trying not to laugh
smart people for having uncle roger come there. uncle roger make everything better. he is like the human version of MSG!
Bloody big round of applause for this guy going in and having a laugh about it all. This has been one of the best with his replies! 🤣
You know chilli jam sounds weird, until I saw this video. Gotta grab one from tracklements yo 🌶️
Alternative title: UNCLE ROGER visits JAMIE OLIVERS Home.
The real uncle Roger should have burnt down the entire factory. HAIYA!
Bring some to Asia and let us try?
Where in canada?
Uncle Roger has finally encountered a quick whipped counter man. This is awesome to watch.
No Jakarta??
walao sinagpore leh
Uncle Roger do Wideo with Josh and Ollie and no go to Korea? Haiya~~ All those pwomises made at Malay westowant, now no good. So sad... T_T
Uncle Roger, you should do a video together with Aunty Liz, and Chef Wan...3 combo...sure meletop!
WHITE HATE = KOPIAH KE???
Who from across the pond will be at your local market international section looking for tracklements products?
Please! For the love of god, tell me! Is Uncle Roger and Nephew Nigel the same person or are they 2 different people?? I CANT TELL ANYMORE T_T
After this visit, I can tell uncle Roger changes his mind about chilli jam.
05:15 WHY SO WEAK!!!? HAIYAA!!!
Lmao, Unc Roger really roasted the brand's name in the face of the CEO. Too sigma, too badass.
keep it easy uncle roger . with his hat its more like Don chilli jam Vito he can cook you and nobody will know it . chilli jam mafia here be carefull XD
"You have solar panels? But you're in the UK...."
Bro this man just made the best business decision of his life. The amount of people that are gonna buy his stuff now. Also the banter between him and Uncle Roger
pls collab with steven he plsssssssss(illtell my ancestor to subscribe)
Why no mask during production?
Good show old sport.
haiyaaa you made disappointed uncle roger
0:45 what aout singapore
another business that no longer welcomes uncle roger
What's the sauce😂
Uncle Roger was so weak... so weak... not able to pick the bucket up.... haiyaaaa......
They should make a "Uncle Roger Chili Jam" for the Asiens. With extra MSG.
Wonderful video and super creative
"this too much! Jason help!"  Why so weak?  So weak... ;)
this chilli tour is surely burning hot  for jamie oliver
Fun fact : prostitution is actually illegal in Thailand. Thai police said there is no prostitution in Bkk red light district 💀
Fuiyoo there is no indonesia in your country list? Uncle satria feel so sad
Uncle Roger, you have to ask a 60 year old guy to help you lift a bucket? So weak, so weak!!
This is my worst nightmare i woke up because i thought i was in a chilli jam factory
Turns out Uncle Roger is a weakling. Still sexy though.
Is that is another uncle roger 00:30
"Jason HeLp!"
OMG I’m so excited that you plan to come to Tokyo!! 🤩
Go to msg factory
instashit that was gold
Respect to Tracklements! Best wishes from Indonesia.
xd dude was eating his chilli jam out
main title:uncle roger goes to fear factory
so chili jam is like sambal but with just extra steps instead cooked with oil it's with a ton of vinegar. P.S. I can't believe they'd let you in their factory despite dissing them for every other episode! LOL
"This is crime against fashion" *Trenderman has entered the chat*
😭❤️come to India please
So white. Said it is wrong to use MSG while all they eat is shet processed food
do a collab with Steven He and Nathan Doan Comedy
I'm so sorry, I'm such a big fan - but this video really seems very corporate. From a marketing standpoint, this makes the character of Uncle Roger seem less authentic in my eyes.
The Tracklement team are so kind. They use solar power and filter their water. I don't like chilli, but I am going to purchase some of this jam anyway.
No Adelaide show. 👎
Imagine you invited someone to your factory, and one of the first things he said is your brand name is weak and you should change the name, lmao
guy: "why dont you imagine auntie helen is in there?"  our favourite Uncle named Roger: "I suddenly have so much strength now" xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
I see Uncle Roger like shang-chi
A
26 Nowember
Chili Jam Profit will sky rocket After This Uncle Come
5:41 Editor must have sorry children on there
No msg lol
Uncle Roger: Hoping he won't get murdered Also Uncle Roger: * *Insulting their company non-stop* *
Chili Jam after uncle roger approve. Stonk Up $$$$$$
Uncle Roger: "Nice kick" Also Uncle Roger: *punches*
If this product range was stocked in our grocery store I'd buy an assorted selection. Uncles wicked humor, the bosses positive vibe and the tour of the production plant combined, were a marketing master stroke. Thoroughly enjoyed this weejio 👍🏽
Nephew Nigel : Bangkok , Tokyo and of course. KL Me : KLLL KLLLLLLLL OMG OMG OMG
I can't believe uncle roger went to this factory it's great they can take a joke dunking on chilli jam since Jamie fucked up lol
Why not Taipei?
This is brilliant
I may have to come to Sydney and see you if the pandemic behaves! Of course I moved away from both KL (my dad helped open the convention centre you're performing in!) and Brisbane to make things harder on myself xD
See you in KL
sort of Disappointed
if this is available in indonesia im legit gonna buy and try tracklements for fried rice
i never clicked on a video so fast.
security guards are scared of msg and thought thoughs are cocaine
Hayya dont go to Brunei but go to KL hayya
Ayeeeee 26 November is my bday. Hi from Malaysia!!

Nigel duplicate!?!?!?!?!?!!?
Uncle Rodger needs to review "Self Cooking Egg Fried Rice Machine" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn4hBelQLlI&t=374s, no chili jam needed.
Uncle Roger soo weak soo weak!
Seems very nice man. Grats chili jam

When u coming to India Uncle Roger ;-;
Won't you do stand up in Bandung, Indonesia? My home twon

When Uncle Roger couldn’t open the container, it was begging for a “SO WEAK” from the guy!
CEO man so funny, and know aunty helen!  fuiyohhhhh
nightmare of every asian dream for jamie oliver
Next MSG Factory Visit 🤣🤣🤣
Mr roger WTH is chilli jam? Is it like Sos chilli maggie atau sos chilli thai?
Fuiyoh chain
pain.
I’m tired of this rollercoaster. When I first discovered Uncle Roger, I thought he was a real person. Then I got the impression that he was just this Nigel guy. Now I see Uncle Roger and Nephew Nigel in the same room together? Is chili jam the only ultimate reality in the universe?!
African niece and nephew No show🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️
Uncle Roger: So heavy.. Me: Uncle Roger so weak, so weak
Glad to meet you.
I love the jokes you guys can get away with in the UK
Now we know where the bomb should be planted
Maybe the manager is Jamie Oliver in disguise
is smokey bbq pork halal?? yes............. SESAT hahahahahaha
Keep making videos this is your art we are made happy by your jokes
Awesome
So weak your brand name 😆
So weak...
I like that guy, he’s kinda like a cool grandad who is funny.
Going to Austrailia and not coming to New Zealand is like putting Chilli Jam in egg fried rice....haiyah

Guy: we don;t need MSG, we got natural flavor Little did he know. MSG is a natural ingrdient
Okay, ol'dude, I'm not into the lack of msg..
WHY UNCLE ROGER NEVER COME SINGAPORE LA WTH.
Chilli jam is just a sweet sambal..
Uncle Roger can’t pick up bin of sugaaar…. SO WEAK. SO WEAK.
Loved the energy in this video ❤️
I like Chili jam
As an asian, NEVER PUT CHILI JAM IN FRIED RICE.
Haiyaa Uncle Roger how come no stopping by Hong Kong ah?

Omg that "no no no, I do it myself" was so cute and pouty 😂 I feel that uncle rog haha
I demand an Uncle Roger/BLACKPINK mukbang, haiya....
If Nigella rolled herself in M.S.G., Uncle Roger would propose imediately.
I'll definately check out Tracklements Chilli Jam at my local stores now.
I love that Uncle Roger (Or his editor) is a Once :)

Uncle Roger too weak to lift or open the buckets... that's why Auntie Helen left him
Uncle Rodger trying to get covid from the president of the chili jam factory. lol

The fact that they're not wearing gas masks says these are not spicy asian chillies.
Can you react to tasty's 25 pound ramen video?
Whyy .. you dont visit jakarta?? Im angry uncle..

MSG  Normies: Mono Sodium Glutamate  Asians: Master of Savoury Goodness  👌👌👌

Uncle roger why so weak? Cant lift a pale of chili ahhahaa

10.09 noo as thai people if jamie oliver come here we kick him out
The CEO seems like a sweet person!
I'm Thai and live in Bangkok but I don't know what Chilli jam is. I guess that the CEO means chili paste.
That vid made me want to buy their stuff! Hope you got paid...And of course, i lolled a few times as well! Nice one.
does uncle roger know what sauce is in weeb carrier ?
Seeing uncle roger's ego go down is truly funny. Such a fun weedio uncle roger🤣

Uncle Roger weaker than Jamie Olive Oil green curry, haiya! Need to practice lifting family bag of rice
I think Uncle Roger needs to review this video next on what this guy eats and how he prepares it. He will go nuts on this guy, but he is a bodybuilder and may hit back lol. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqZ1mQ546aI
No show in SG?

Uncle Roger just making a very long ads
Uncle roger look so small compared to factory people
Wholesome
That chili jam actually looks good. But I think Uncle Roger is an undercover agent for MSG agenda. 0.o Hiyaa
oiy cousin nigel, do a show in Singapore please
Next time the factory owner must open every thing for uncle roger before he open for 20 minute
lmao the way he just couldn't take his eyes off of you Uncle Roger. You better watch out of he's going to try and make him self your husband.
5:17 Uncle Roger why so weak? So weak.
No sg? 😞
Chill jam unlocked. What's next? Uncle Roger and Jamie Oliver?
If rhe CEO of is Chilli Wonka then Uncle Roger is MSG Wonka.
Uncle Rogers: “Usually when people go to Bangkok and Thailand, they come back with wife, not Jam”  Me a Thai: *Choke on my dinner*
nephew nigel actully exist!?!?
Weak lah URoger
best job for HK BritishNOers haha, but they will probably F it up as they are so weak and slow and they will never stop complaining haha
This was such a great video! Really genuine and Guy was great! Thanks!
I thought he is going to burn the factory
Shout out to Guy for playing along.
@0:38 split screen revealed
Uncle Roger,  What do you think about Chef John from the “Taste Show” he used rice cooker to make fried rice!  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YieIRSCHndM
Uncle roger coming to Bangkok? YAY!!!!! :D Also will there be a live stream also?
Fuiyoh have bangkok in list

*"You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain"*
Staking out the enemy I see....
Aww! Your rice cooker neon sign is so cool!
Pretty classy guy.  I bet he has a really nice motorbike collection.
that moment when you realized that asian people is whiter than white people.
uncle roger: NOOOOO WHY CHWILLI JAMMMMM  also uncle roger: * gives mr chili jam stocks *
uncle roger is bought  by chilly jam factory?
Instashit
Uncle Roger, please review Steven Lim for his show - Dish Granted. Especially the one with Nasi Lemak. Steven Lim made it big on buzzfeed, now he's ventured out. Would love to see overseas Malaysians collab.
That packing lady was throwing so much shade >.<
Fun Fact  : YouTube put a dog food ad in this chili jam video 🤣🤣🤣🤣
who else wants to see a follow up video with the motorbike collection?
Imagine telling the CEO their brand is weak :v
怎麽都沒戴口罩
I’m pretty sure that this ceo already seen uncle Rogers videos before lol
Uncle Roger so weak can't lift sugar, can't stir like factory worker... so sad.
FAK  your ads!
Uncle roger trying to blend in and be more whiter
In the end..., it's endorsement.... But I love it.... 🤣👍
It taste of revenge... best line to date.
Wow!Uncle Roger has a full crew now,fuiyohhhh!
Uncle Roger so weak so weak. Not enough MSG Neice a d Nephews be sure to go to his world tour to make sure he's keeping up with his MSG intake
Uncle Roger and the _I Love Lucy_ conveyor belt moment.
Bummer Tracklements doesn't ship to US
5:18 Uncle Roger why so weak.. so weak???
That was weird.
White  People country best people country.
Hi Uncle Roger... Can u cook turkey with Mr Bean 😁😁🇲🇾
This is going to put Tracklements on the map!
01:43 haiyaa so weak your brand name.... hahaha
Why not Singapore
I would like to actually try this chilli jam with fish balls, pork balls and beef balls. That should be nice.   No not the kind you get at takeaway, that's something we make up for white people, not real Asian food XD
I don't know how Nigel going in hard on Jamie Oliver never stops being funny.
เครื่องปรุงใช้กับของกินเล่น ^ ^
When lockdown ends plz come to new zealand bb
why don't you go to indonesia :'(
This is Jamie Oliver's favorite place because have chill jam
Is he your uncle or your brother or maybe edit?
Haiyaaaa..uncle roger body so nice..cant lift small bucket….so weak..so weak..😂
He can roast Jamie without using heat EVERY WEEJIO
Guy is cool, he keeps up with you Uncle Roger.
Guy is cool, he keeps up with you Uncle Roger.
If I ever buy chili jam I will absolutely seek out this brand. Great video! Great marketing! Love this guy!
Never come Singapore? Haiyaa
Lol white people countries? Canada is super diverse. America also
Coming to Adelaide man?

Sweet chili sauce is basically chili jam 😅
Haiyaaah Why chilli jam what happen to sambal uncle roger
The "no!" And worried face when nephew guy brings out the egg fried rice. Lmfaoo🤣🤣🤣🤣
Uncle Roger has outdone himself. Great video!😆😆😆😆
Is chile jam like pepper jelly?
Finally  . Uncle Roger does Chilly jam a justice
I think I heard this guy on BT sports boxing. haha
You can tell a place is really impress when it impresses uncle Roger
Uncle roger facing his absolute worst nightmare.
@mrnigelng come Singapore also leh😝
Greetings from Thailand. I wanna try  the British chillie jam for once. They put cider vinegar in there so it's gotta be very flavorful.
Old white dude clearly a fan. REspect.
3:52 "Nah just eating it" more like eating it out
Go to Thailand usually get wife back Me:Uncle Roger Know everything!!!
Next Uncle Roger Visit MSG FACTORY fuiiyoh.
CEO: We love Jamie Oliver Uncle Roger : <smile> <no reply> This CEO is a very tactful Peace Maker.  Well Done !!
i bought a jar of chili jam when i visited england. airport security stole it from me bc it was that good
Repeat after me: Chile Jam does not go on Egg Fried Rice, Jamie Oliver doesn't know what he is doing
Next year you must visit the MSG factory
So there are people out there that will be buying chili jam made by Uncle Roger  And they won’t even know
Yay! if your going to thailand go to phitsanulok!!!! ( my home town)
Okay but like can we all take a moment to appreciate how uncle roger is just so amazing, funny and cultured? I always get bullied for being asian, but watching Uncle Roger's videos just make me feel proud to be asian.
How is it possible that Uncle Roger has more character development than an average primetime television character
to defeat ur enemy, first u had to know ur enemy
Ririririri
Uncle Roger got set up. Chili jam on fried rice by a Jamie Oliver fan.
Can’t wait for the tour, see you in Tokyo
Man just admitted to child mass murder, haiyaaa.
Has anayone asked worker's about the facility and situations , probably not so this video is  a fail .
Omg so we can bring other kinds of white powder only isn’t msg hahahah
I wanna order that chili sauce 😍
is it me he sound like donald trump?
No New Zealand?  Haaiiiiiiyaaaaaa.
That was hilarious!
9:00 UNCLE WORST NIGHTMARE!!!
CEO:"Image it’s Auntie Helen” Uncle Roger:"My name is Uncle! Roger! And I'm here to take my rrrrrrrrrevenge!"
fuiyoh
Uncle Roger: How many children disappear in this factory? Nephew: Ive lost count.   This dude is so chill-i 😂
Great video Uncle
I hope I'm not the only one who sings along whenever the "you make me feel special" comes up
It says 40 k likes and no dislikes 😂🤟
chilli jam fac😂
are you going to discriminate who can come to your concerts?
Haiyaa, old white man stir better than Uncle Roger.
Not a fan of the text popping up lol Makes the video look cheap.
Did you say you are coming to Australia? Any chance you are trying to come to Perth?
Guy: well Jason's gonna show us how ro make it but DON'T give away the recipe Roger: Onion
Go to MSG Factory Uncle!!!
this is both cool to see and also incredibly cringe.
Uncle Roger, your mustache area so red. How did you irritate it?
I wonder how much this will boost sales
Haha😄see you anytime happy！haiya see you again.
Are you twins?
Not sold your soul AT ALL 😈
"Men would never be scared" Men:
FUIYOH uncle guy is friends with jars because of all the live Queens his jars brings him
I have never wanted to buy chilli jaam more, I'm actually gonna check this company out
What a very informative wideo, thanks for the great content!
Will there be tiny pieces of Uncle Roger in these chilli jam in the coming few months?
Gym , hit gym hit gym , uncle Roger  Weakling
Hahaha
Uncle, next time please show us the MSG factory :)
It looks like all those muscles were just for show.
we don't all like jamie oliver, he took away our twizzlers!
This ep why so weak uncle roger
Uncle Roger lifting sugar, why so weak? SO WEAK?!
Trackements is nice but stokes has the firey heat
haiyaaaaaaa! Uncle Roger, why so weak? Cant lift bucket of sugar. Struggle so much just to stir chili jam. Bucket lid has more muscle than you
Such chemistry. You two should be recognized by Nobel
"Nigella is ... because she on cocain but still such nice person." LMAAOOO
Nephew guy: “Don’t give the recipe away”  Uncle Roger: *Proceeds to list every ingredient as they are poured in on video*
Why no MSG
This guy is just some random dude but he was legit funny and keeping up with the jokes and everything. Must be a fun boss lol.
Tracklements: Don’t give the recipe away Uncle Roger: Onions... Chilli.. Cider vinegar...
We should all just tag Jamie Oliver and show him this
This weedio has more comedy than our local tv show. contents getting funnier with this factory tour :))))
The best chilli jam ad
Uncle roger is just the best
Uncle Roger 1 year ago: Haiyaaa why u use chili jam?? Uncle Roger 1 year later: Chili jam tastes like revenge
Pple who live in Germany be like: excuze me wha
Haiyaaa why security so negative thinking
MSG is natural
fuck that, if I can't bring MSG I'm out :P
Great video
I hate it how the CEO'S they don't get engaged with Uncle Roger, they just try to use uncle Roger as an advertising platform and talk about the company. We don't care you use solar panels to make chilli jam, we want to know if you have a secret underground delivery system connected to Jamie Oliver's restaurants !
uncle roger:its so hard nephew guy,what would you if that's auntie helen? uncle roger mind:i squash her like i pray for been struct by lightning
You should visit an Ajinomoto MSG factory. Make sure to bring a translator.
what do people expect us to do with chilli jam? put it on our toast in the morning?
And that’s how you have 1 M view 22 min advertisement.  Wow
Did uncle roger just did locking????? Uncle roger know how to DANCE! SHOW US MORE!!!!
Just got back from watching Nigel Ng live in Sheffield, ready to watch his new video. Great live show, so funny!
This is amazing, I love this boss lol
7:21 hiyaaah🥿 luckily no belt emoji of course my dumb ass thought it would be under sports category should be😂🤣🤣🤣jk
Haiya, I just received Uncle Roger's international tour timetable for 2022. You will go to so many capital cities all over the world but you don't include Dublin, in Ireland. Why you don't like Ireland? Are you now like the white people in England that don't like Irish? I am disappointed. Uncle Roger didn't come to Helsinki Finland when I was there. Now I moved to Ireland and Uncle Roger is going to Helsinki. Grrr....
Haiyaaa so weakkk
No Indonesia ,haiyahh
It feels weird looking at food manufacturing factory and nobody’s wearing face masks
I looooove Tracklements!
ah yes the most important ingredint in chilli jam: "children"
Do NOT even insinuate negativity on Heinz. Pittsburgh will riot within a minute!
Are you by chance coming to Michigan?
I live in kl
Uncle Roger can’t lift 10kg? So weak 😜
the tartar sauce in our restaurant has the same kind of lid its fucking infuriating 😭
I wonder if Uncle Roger will start loving Chilli Jam like he loves MSG
Of course the chilli jam factory CEO is chill, it's not the "i jam" factory
NIKE doesn't use a swish, they use a swoosh...lol!  😉
Shiiii how was Nigel and uncle roger sitting together, what sorcery is this
This CEO was hysterical! I really didn't expect him to have such chemistry and riff with Nigel so well
5.18 "Jason Help"...Haiyaaaa Uncle Roger, you are so weak...so weak. That's because you eat too many MSG 😁🤭
I legit thought that you passed away and went straight to hell, after reading the title
Another great vid Uncle Roger. But your tour isn't coming to Adelaide Australia. So weak!!!!!!  Tell Uncle Nigel to come to Adelaide for the Fringe Festival. Lots of fellow comedians. 🤣
Okay, I'm now curious about trying chili jam, but not in my fried rice.
Haiya!  Why you no come to Seoul Uncle Roger!
The humor is so so spot on. This man deserves a rice... A raise 😅
Haha hilarious video that spark joy in me 🤣🤣
That ceo is soo wholesome!!
Maybe go to an MSG factory next? owo
whaaat has jamie oliver done, the poor guy hahahaha
Nephew Guy is a good sport :)
I tried to order the chili jam online in AU, it is out of stock. You need to produce more! :D
can confirm most people in the uk do not like jamie oliver.
This was so much fun.^^ The lady(?) at 07:49 just cracked me up. Her expression is deadpan comedy.
'Jason..help!' :-).  Genius.
International tour and no Singapore?? That's hardly an international tour then.
I think Uncle Roger will loving Chili Jam more than ever
Bit surprised you seal and wrap the jars when the chilli Jam is still hot
Guy likes Jason's sauce...
Uncle roger and Nigel look very similar…
Do a msg factory next
HIYYYAAAAA WHY ONLY WHITE PPL CUNTRYYY
You are missing the most liveable city in Australia: Adelaide.... :-(
If Arnold were British
Uncle, You’re not coming to Los Angeles? HAIYAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!  😢
Never thought in a million years I’d laugh this hard at a video all about chili jam lol
When you are Malaysian and hear KL  WHERE THE TICKETS AT?
India?
Love the CEO, so much care to explain the concept of Jam. Jam is not bad as we, asian, thought. Maybe Jam is used for Universal Business terminology, instead of sauce.
Ewww...why are you putting your nasty fingers in the spices!!!  WTF??? 🙄
Tracklements make my favourite piccalilli. I still have no idea what chili jam goes well with though.
🤣
No shows in Asian countries cus I’m pretty sure they’re offended by Uncle Roger character haiya
6:55 now wait, is that a rinsing machine, or a filling machine?
Most wholesome collection of sexual jokes about jam I've seen in a while
Honestly, the saftyvest compliments the orange polo rather well. Maybe you should wear that more often.
Ok
Come to Singapore lah
Yeyyy-can’t wait to see you here in Oz, Nigel and his uncle. 😉
Lmao I’m imagining Nigel going in and being like “okay so when I switch accents just roll with it, don’t laugh too much 😂”  This was so fun, very cool to see the factory and your guide was so friendly and social, I had a blast watching this.
Not going to Euro country, why so weak?
Come to south africa 🇿🇦🇿🇦beautiful country with a large number of Asian cities
this guy is so incredibly chill
Chilli Jam Board realize Uncle Roger's influence power and decided to bribe him. It's kinda late but still smart.
Actually we don’t love Jamie Oliver ,why do you think his restaurants failed
man said he "collects mountain bikes " not ride ...lets not judge here!!
Good vid bro
“Jason help” 😂 needs to be on a t shirt
fui-yoh! and i thought chili jam was just jam that was spicy
I love ❤ watching Uncle Roger when I argue with girlfriend.
Uncle Roger researching the passion for Uncle Jamie's favorite Chilli jam,.... excellent short documentary idea.
Can someone tell me the music name starting at 8:42 with the bassline? I'll give you all the FUIYOOH out there
This was cute that was a neat tour that was cool of everyone
I like fella.  I wasn't sure until he made the joke about putting kids in the jam.    He's alright in my books.
OMG there's a filling machine!
THE CEO WAS SO CUTEEE BYE QWQ
most wholesome thing ive seen since nigels tour
Pretty entertaining, nice puns and jokes
5:20 Uncle, why so weak?!
Imagine it's Auntie Helen in there.... Lovely old bloke!
Uncle Rodger can't afford septwolves shirt. Hayaaa... Also where your belt? Can't even see it without your shirt not tucked in. *puts leg off chair
I always thought nephew nigel was just uncle Roger dressed up. How did I never realize he was actually another person
that was coincidental with the nigella seeds there- clearly the nigels are meant to be
Uncle Roger comes face to face with British sarcasm lol
When will the USA dates be announced?
Old nephew
Very successful advertising, I think I should get one 💯
457167 person here
The title had me scared that  Uncle Roger had turned into Jamie Oliver fuckboi.
Waiting for Uncle Roger to say joke about boat people when using the oar in the chilli jam. Also, Why so weak when stirring? I think M.S.G is making you *so weak*!!
i'm just imagining the interactions when requesting to make a video at the factory "so i'll go there and i'll be roasting the living shit out of your company and you can't clap back"
Love love love ❤
just eating it😂🤔
The owner was so lovely. Nice tour.
Work at Gucci
Please come to Alaska!
Please come to Alaska!
you fucked up, you  should have said taipei not tokyo, u fucked up
Marketing jam through a comedian dunking on it. Genius.
That CEO gives zero fucks…. :)
Uncle roger I think you have to workout you can’t even pick up bucket haiya
Nigel is really going out of his way to get Jamie Oliver on his show.
Nephew Guy is older than Uncle Roger 😂😂😂😂
The CEO: I’m gonna pull what they call a “pro-gamer” move.
so weak uncle Roger, so weak😂
===Nigel and Nigella Ng===
Chili jam manufacturer finally got him
Suprised how chill uncle roger was at the start, I thought he be like: WTF, WTF, what is all this sh*t
That guy's voice is great. He should consider voice acting
Anyone notice at the beginning that nephew Nigel's head is bigger than uncle Rogers?  Edit, Guy is a legend.
Jamie oliver should advertise and be on the front of the cover of chili jam lolol
Guy was a really good sport, fair play to him. I'd not heard of their brand but I'm gonna have to give it a go now!
I hope uncle roger and Jamie oliver collaborate on a youtube video like a cook-off type setup.. hahaha
Asian version of Dania cook
Not gonna lie. It's gonna be pretty funny when you pass Jaime Oliver's subscribership.
Steven he
Not gonna lie bro you lost some man points in this video lmfao but I love your stuff brother
It took me a minute to figure out why Uncle Roger was wearing the orange safety vest.
I love Uncle Roger lol🤣🤣😂 I love how he roast the hell out of people .
Um excuse me, there are lots of asians here in Canada including me
❤
Funny videos... white people this... white man that... racism is alive people.
If Chili Jam can be redeemed... I expect a full on Jamie Oliver collab and redemption arc
Calling him nephew when he’s twice your age 🤡
“Uncle Roger suddenly have so much strength” Fuiyoh!
The CEO actually having fun with this made this so much better.
I like how oncoe roger front him the whole time
Uncle Roger need to work out more.  He getting verry flabby.  Maybe Auntie Liz can help.
Not racist but they look the same
4:17 Uncle Roger cannot handle spice Haiyaa, so weak, so weak
Tracklement guy is funny
"But I love sauce"  Every weeb: _a man of culture he is_
well that was awkward
Yo what bout africa n south america
Uncle Roger is twice as young as the CEO but still calls him Nephew. Lol
Tracklements is actually a more modern word than Nike. Nike comes from the ancient Greek word νικη which means victory.
Come to Germany
I bet nephew Nigel could’ve listed that bucket of sugar easily bc he’s ripped
"Jason help", "hard to stir".... why so weak uncle Roger? Why so weak?
If I ever need some chilli jam, I will get Tracklement!
I love it who ever came with this collaboration Genius.💓💞💞💞💞
They twins?
Well done giving a genuine producer of Chilly Jam a break after bashing that product, both in humor and in seriousness! You did good, m8!!!
Oh my goodness, Nephew Guy is awesome!
0:37 Don't forget to adjust the mask on the table for shadows and reflections.
KL? Kuala Lampur?
What no tour stop in germany? :(
chilli jam dopeeee
If he was sexually involved with his chilli jam he would have to visit ER not HR.
That massive Tory is pretty weird.
Best video yet lol
now blow it up
Europe?
Uncle Roger should collaborate with Jamie Oliver
Uncle Roger a little weak.. He needs to do some push-ups.. Failure..
Seriously that CEO is a good sport. Love that dude
Why does Uncle Roger look younger than his nephew? Msg make you like Brad Pitt in that Movie the Curious Case of Benjamin Button.
HES A BIKER TOO! Ah man this guy is super cool 😎  You would probably like my 09 Bonnie I’m putting a 2016 Thruxton R front end and spacing the wheels here soon.  It’s gonna handle real well
Look, it's not hard to create clowns when you have the proper editing software but this isn't about finding editing mistakes. This is about my theory that Nephew is Uncle Roger's twin brother and Uncle Roger just keeps him locked up in a basement
Uncle roger … so weakk
When he brought out the fried rice🤣🤣🤣🤣
This was so good 😂
Nephew guy what a total legend and such a nice guy best he’s a top boss.
OMG I never thought I would see uncle eat chili jam!!!! ❤️
This CEO is 👌🏻
Damn Uncle Roger gettin schooled how hard it is to make Chili Jam
Awwww I like this guy.  I like when he just started rolling comedy with you.  What a nice man 👍
Lmfao 🤣🤣🤣 tracklement...so weak 🤣🤣🤣🤣
It is a rare experience to meet a CEO that has any kind of personality. This was fun.
Uncle Roger: if you speak to that jam, you need more friends. Him also: *him also have sexual relationships with unalive objects*
Chili jam taste shit on egg fried rice I got spanking for a week
UNCLE ROGER PRO CHINA SLAVERY 🇨🇳
If someone brings an empty msg bag, would you sign it?
Why so weak? So weak?
Uncle Roger can't bring his favorite white powder packet. 😪
That was hilarious! 🤣🤣🤣 What happens in the chili jam factory, stays in the chili jam factory. 😆🤣  I love how the CEO just went with the flow. 🤣
When you come to Bangkok ? Of course Get ready
moral of the story, chilli jam is not the enemy, jamie oliver is.
#freetibet
NEON RICE COOKER 😻🤩
Taste of revenge :))))))
Just brilliant, and all good humoured too!
Uncle Roger's skin is glowing😳 But it's nice seeing their energy match
its not heavy your just weak  haiyaaaa
The CEO is a cool guy. “Instashit” lol.
So if I am not wrong, after reacting to Oliver's Fried Rice video the sales of chill jam went so low that CEO himself have to take  help of Uncle Roger. From the beginning to the end of this video feels like this company asked UR to tell the audience that its not a sweet jam or something.  ---to all the Ns&Ns.
Uncle Roger need help with spice. So WEAK!! 😂🤣
Great video
Anyone else think that the ceo sounds like kano in mortal kombat?
I have a lot of respect for the CEO.🌹🌹💗💗 He's so cool, funny and chill. 😘😘 Now I want try that Chili Jam.  Love the video. So awesome funny.🌹🌹🌻🌻🙌🙌👍👍💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗❤❤
I just love this new nephew 😅 He takes all the jokes so well and surely watched a lot Uncle Rog before he met him. Now i need to buy a jar of his jam.
Uncle Roger did you turn vegan or why are you so weak, so weak😂
I have no clue how these 2 got connected but I’m happy it happened.
Ceo guy is such a great sport, if I'm ever in the UK I will get some of that hot sauce and jam!
Awesome show thank you guys
Oh my, I always look so forward to seeing your new videos. Thanks! Can't wait to see you live.😂😂
So this is what hell looks like
those sauces look really good
One step closer to that Jamie Oliver collab that will cause the Internet to implode.
You can see it was even awkward for Uncle Roger in the video.🤣
No New Zealand? 🥺
Best ad ever! Seriously!
Uncle roger weak.why are you soo weak
Uncle Roger, Pls colab with Steven He
Uncle roger weak .
Plot Twist: Uncle Roger visits the Chili Jam Factory founded and invented by Jamie Olive-Oil.
Am ur grt fan can u plz react on indian cooking.
I want get a heart, plz ♥️
This ceo seems like he was a fan before and it makes for such a great video. His energy is AMAZING!
I'm Thai and never had chilli jam before.
I always love the TWICE song references in Uncle Roger's videos. Excellent choice Uncle Roger
I love when he says, “sorry children.” 🤪♥️
This chilli jam must be very aromatic and flavorful that the CEO can withstand uncle's stinky mouth 😅
Imagine having like a 98% non American, non-UK audience and not touring countries you have viewers in.
Uncle Roger saying Fuiyoo while struggling to stir is just the kind of wholesome shit I needed.
uncle guy was amazing. I'd buy his chilli jam if i could.
Uncle Roger is a Once. This makes me feel special.
In Louisiana, USA we like to put pepper jelly (not sure if it's the same) with sour cream on crackers as well.
Wait is there actually 2 identical uncle Roger? Or it’s jsut editing
Throw that in Olivers Face
That dude looks like Dr. Nefario from Despicable me
Uncle Roger need friends too when he always talk to his rice cooker
Makes me wanna buy chilli jam 😂
I want some Chili Jam now
INSTASHIT XD
I watched this when it premiered and still can't get enough of it
Why only tour the Commonwealth, haiyaa! People on the Continent love Uncle Roger and his nephew too!
Let's just take a moment to appreciate how Guy Tullberg is the ultimate Uncle Roger sidekick.
5:17 Nephew Nigel work out. Why uncle Roger not work out and lift sugar, haiyaa! So lazy. So lazy!
i won't preorder until i know where it is
Love the orange safety vest to keep with the Uncle Roger brand.
When you come to China !!!
Safety of the camera man before finishing the shot hahaha
nice commercial for them !
This video just made me say fuiyoh and haiyaa all at the same time
This makes me want to pick up some chili jam and actually try it
Guy definitely passed the vibe Check
Why you calling that man nephew.
I'm eating garlic egg fried rice as I'm watching this 😜
very good video :) !!! once again Nigel, I twitted u about the challenge from hot's one !!  U always said that white people can't eat too spicy food !! For my part my prefer food its Lamb Vindaloo !! very hot spicy !! I will just love to view u go up with the hot one challenge like gordon ramsay made it (2 years ago) !! Im a fan !! thank you so much for all ur video !! :) !!
Has anyone actually tried chili jam?  How is it different from chili sauce?
The way he half shrieked " JASon , HeLp " 😂😂
shouldnt tehy wear masks or they spit rom talking just is accepted in food in the uk?
WAIT UNCLE ROGER SOUNDS NORMAL😭😭
This YT video is probably the most fun thing thats happened in this factory for years
You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
is chilli jam just like sambal in our local cuisine?
Don’t bring MSG.🤣🤣🤣
To anyone who went to see his shows. What was it like explaining the white powder to security.
This video is so wholesome! Now I want to buy from Tracklements, but I don't think they ship to Southeast Asia 😅
Uncle Roger. Perhaps Jakarta also got included in that standup tour. If yes, then it's really nice, and I would consider attending the tour. But if not, yeah there would be many other opportunities to see you anywhere.
I legit thought chili jam is just other name for chili sauce, only thicker
Who's next after nephew Guy?  Uncle Ben maybe?
Love this video!! Love the CEO! Great Jam. Love to try it.
Yoooo Nigel and Uncle Roger look so much alike
Omg my birthday is the 26th 🤣🤣 Time to see if I can go see Uncle Roger lol, buy myself tickets for a present
Guy Tullberg was such a good sport! Made me even want to put Chilli Jam in my fried rice
25th Nov is fried rice festival for China. Will you produce a video to celebrate it?
They gave too much!!!
why not  india  ??? Hayaiia. ...
Time to visit MSG factory next...
Uncle roger! Why so weak?!
Are we finally going to get Uncle Roger at Madison Square Garden? We need Uncle Roger at MSG
Haiyaaa...uncle roger getting so weak to new profound chili jam...lol
twice reference again, uncle roger is an once 100% confirmed
Hi ya why not Singapore
Haiya so weak!! My grandma still lifts boxes of cabbage for kimchi! why you so weak! Eat some meat
haaiyaaa come to India as well..
You have to have some balls of steel to go up to a CEO and just tell him "Your life is sad and your brand name is weak"
Jamie Oliver probably did clicked like and closed the video instantly, haha...
Good editing.
Kudos to the guy for understanding what Uncle Roger is. I can see other people getting offended by not understanding the character. He does a great job rolling with it.
ghus voice is so deep
This video is illegal
5:36 it very hard to STuuu
FUUIIIIIIYOOOOO
You said that only scared of earthquake,flood,tsunami. But come on it's just chili jam,hospital is everywhere don't be worry 🥸🥸🥸
Such a wholesome video. Good to see a CEO that is so on point with what's going on and being able to take a joke or two Well done to the whole team!
Whoever it was in the marketing team at Tracklements that set this up is a genius 🙏🏼
Uncle Roger should sell bags of msg at the event, and he could just say it's part of his merch line.  Sounds legit to me.
Why does this episode of Uncle Roger remind me of a twisted episode of Mister Rogers
Uncle Roger always so original, keep it up 🤩🤩
5:28 Uncle Roger: this is the stuff that you use on boat trip!  Me: that's what my mom used to hit me with
NO MSG?? MSG looks nothing like nose candy.  Long crystals, very different and I would assume much more painful. :)
The ingredients in that chili jam are good. Just not for fried rice in my opinion. I prefer a little salty instead of sweet when it comes to fried rice. Could be tasty on a turkey sandwich.
How could you not come to China!?!?! You've got lots of nieces and nephews here!
u no visit India :( me sed me big fan from india
Hi Uncle Roger, i think at this point should view Adam Liaw's ENTIRE ramen section. I bet you gonna title him Uncle too🤗
I hope your coming to LA. The most chinese city in the US. It's so chinese I don't even speak english.
Those condiments look really good.  Do they sell to the US?  Asking for a friend.
Quick! Team Lift @5:17
that big guy sounds like shaq looks like shaq too hmmmm
Good to see uncle Roger repent himself after he almost brought down their business hahahhaha
That CEO had a great sense of humor, good sport. XD
Is this brand available in Canada?
Not coming to Europe? Why so weak? Are you afraid of Brexit?
Nephew Guy is hella funny, i absolutely loved the video!!
this guys seems like hed actually be a great boss
Guy Rocks!
god it's getting worse with every video are there now 2 people or is he alone? i really don't know xD
I love that guy just for the Instashit....
Uncle Roger's casually pained face at 5:50 absolutely killed me! 😂 can't stop replaying it!
well done, uncle roger. now review the Lao Gan Ma crispy chilli.
You went to meet the devil🤣🤣🤣
Good sport 👍🏻
Jason: 💪💪💪
健身白练了属于是哈哈哈哈
CEO looks like he might put his fist through you if you were to talk shit about his jam down at the pub after hours. I'll bet all his motorbikes are converted to run on pure jam ...the teslas of jam ...
Please come to Berlin, so that people can bring the white powder they want.
why so weak lol
You know we need UNCLE ROGER visits msg factory!
Loved it !! Congratulations for the tour is well deserved !
💖Thanks for the new video! Uncle Roger, your wry humor makes my day better.
I actually quite enjoy these "how is it made" type of videos
Bro this man just made the best business decision of his life. The amount of people that are gonna buy his stuff now. Also the banter between him and Uncle Roger👌
No Europe dates for the tour?:(
Uncle Roger! What are you doing in a chili jam factory? You don't even have a toaster! LOL! Video: Good! Good! A nice info tour.
i dont know if uncle nigel is real or fake anymore and at this point im too afraid to ask
Damn that company had balls and an amazing PR team to collab love it
Hey Uncle Roger I was the black nephew at your show in Manchester just wanted to say was an awesome show and we'll be coming again in February lookin forward to it
Gotta meet Steven He in USA and make video.
pleeeeease come to korea
The factory owner is a cutie 🥰😀
The tittle should be "roasting Jamie Oliver"
You noticed that Uncle Roger and Nephew Nigel have the same haircut?
lol 😂 We only wear white hats when someone dies!
In this video, Uncle Roger looks like a little kid😂
Boss: “Imagine auntie Helen in there” uncle Rodger: “I suddenly feel so much strength” some people: “what do you mean by that”🤨
"In asia we only wear white hat when sombody in family die" me: Looking at the white guy with white hat. me: rip
I love this sort of advertising collaborations.
what about india??
Regular British people are boring 😏  Edit: Que British hate 🙄
8:04 guy behind them looks at them like "you don't have a fcking clue what we do here, you go back to the office and send some emails"  Reminds me every manufacturers where 90% of people got less knowledge of production process than remaining 10% :D
Who was the marketing Genius that hired a truly hater of his product for an ad? cause it works
People in this asia city be like: o yeah o yeah yay yay yay btw i from perak uncle roger
nike gonna sue you lol
I like Uncle Roger, but ngl that jam owner just let him touch the spices without gloves and they both talking over the cooking cylindrical pot without a mask - made me cringe, that owner should've been more conscious about the hygiene as this is going to be watched by millions of people
It's weird that i worked in a food factory for 3 years, and comparing it to other factories you see, it was never clean.
That guy was loving this haha
Nephew Nigel looks so much like Uncle Rodger
My husband thinks I have gone off the rockers with all the laughing I am doing.  The chile jam guy was funnny.🤣
🇨🇳🥡🥢💀 just eating knowing you are working at your most hated factory
4:35 - Onion? Onions are for poor people.
He name is guy and he wears blue shirt ....he must be a fan of "free guy"
Omg Uncle Roger just ate chili jam and liked it! I think you can put it in fried rice from now on
This video has no right to be this funny
8:56 now that’s funny
Why not go to Africa too hayaaaa
uncle roger in my head is saying, white people so strong, asians use pencils for weights in math class
Fuiyoooooh ❤️😘
Ohhhh daaaaaaang whenever Nigel says "Sorry children" in that voice ... SPLOOSH 🥵💦🌊
That was a rinsing machine, right?
Damn Uncle Roger, u couldn't open that container of chillies. WHY SO WEAK? Lol
Uncle Rodger visiting a place I been going to for years servicing their weighing equipment. Seeing the equipment I sold/maintain in the background was entertaining. Must of been great fun for all the guys working on site that day!
Lmao white people country 🤣
Does the swoosh in the label mean they use *slaves* to make their products like nike does??
Got nice kick to it while he punched the air
Go to Msg factory next
Meh. Cool that people think the manager guy was funny and a good sport. I thought he annoying and I didnt enjoy him acting like he was a comedian. Maybe it's a British thing.
“So I was traveling in Bangkok and Thailand” umm I’m pretty sure Bangkok is in Thailand 😂😂
you know he’s good when he nearly drops a giant bucket of sugar and still doesn’t break
uncle roger and Jason crossover X3
Uncle Guy clearly loved this!
Why dont islands and African countries deserve some uncle roger love????  Since your audience is white and Asian countries, I see no point in being a subscriber. (I will never see you in any of the places I visit). Now, we break up.
Please review doobydobat Naruto ramen🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
5 million subscribers we need uncle roger to collab with Jamie Oliver or Gordon Ramsay
5:16 Uncle Roger so weak, so weak!xD
No Hong Kong so sad.
Poison the chili jam so Jamie don’t use it again.
Some brutal cuts in this one lol just bashes the brand name and immediately cuts before the guy's response
Wait. So uncle Roger and Nephew Nigel is not the same person 🙆🏽‍♂️
How many children have disappeared in your factory 😨😰🥶
Uncle Roger not tour Africa I sad now
I'm gonna need a Nigella and Uncle Roger collab.
Your videos always make me laugh, thank you Uncle Roger. (I have MSG now from watching Uncle Roger)
he was an amazing guest and so funny too. he really gave you your shit right back at you. have him on again. like maybe make one of jamie olivers reciepe out of his book that was on the shelf and see how crap it really is.
No msg 😑😬😔😂
ORANGE vest... nice touch lol
Epic 👌
Uncle roger have that touch
Great humour from the owner, made the whole tour interesting.
My man have to deal with uncle roger 😤😂🤣😭
Uncle Roger is really Baby Roger next to “Nephew” Guy. Also needs to put his biceps to good use, so weak, haiyaa. After working those biceps out, he gets treated to “lunch” of celery and carrot sticks.
Comment msg is the god of flavor if you hate chili jam in egg fried rice
Nephew guy life so sad like Jamie Oliver’s cooking
Why no India!? WHY NO INDIA!?
Three hours late
Uncle Roger looks alot like Nigel it's like... It's like they are the same people!  Conspiracy theory! They are twins!
Insulted the man within 30 seconds 🤦🏿‍♂️😂😂😂
Next, Uncle Roger visits Colendar factory
Props for that owner being so engaged and making it work so well.
9:27 it’s not a mixture it’s all on top of eachother
This really makes me want to try some Chilli Jam :D
That's a lot of fried rice.
Love this!
This guy had no clue what he invited into his life
Instashit was hilarious
Uncle Roger can't even lift sugar. So weak, so weak.
Just found out about this channel and this video came up. Fuiyoooo. Great content.
Indeed
5:17 this part damn funny  🤣
0:37 if you know, you know
We need behind the scenes of this episode :D
So nice so much insults
Congratulations on your new tour.
When you perform in places like HK and KL, do you do the act in English?
"How many children have disappeared in your factory?" "I've lost count, because we just put them in here." Love this guys sense of humor :D
Smart move done by the manufacturer to approach uncle Rogers. Now I know about chilli jam.
Nephew Guy is awesome. He insults Uncle Roger about using msg and pranks him at the end with egg fried rice. 😁 Omg, Uncle Roger gets hot and bothered over Nigella seeds. 😳🤣
Noice
5:20 Uncle Rodger so weak, so weak...
:1 me: why is my cher like uncle roger    cher: i watch uncle roger    me; 0_0 runs*
Uncle Roger soooo wikk
Kay yell  Yes thats how we said it
5:07 Why does this remind me of Breaking Bad so much?
guy
There place where the main ingredient for egg fried rice is made.
He looked so upset when he said he thought it was like ketchup 🤣
so he finally gave in to chilli jam
now you try chilli jam what you think what you think?
ohhh uncle roger i love you!!!
hi :p
I'm sure I've met the owner before in public, weird. Good video though!
Come to South Africa 😀😁🇿🇦
He’s a good sport
Thank you, Uncle Roger, for this wonderful birthday present!
So nice that Uncle Roger promotes the company and shows the good quality of the process for chili jam and such. Great that he shows and promotes other's fine business's. Learn much about this company and will try their products. Thanks for a fun and light hearted video and showing a great company at work.
(09:08) 😂😂
The 176 people who disliked use chili jam in their fried rice
In the end they ate chili jam with cream cheese and coriander... that's such a British combination wtf
He got a Chilli Jam sponsor before Zojirushi sponsorship. Sad :'(
I know this is a dumb question but are you going on a tour in london
0:40 - Where exactly is KL? xD
How you struggle with sugar?  It so sweet and delish and you cannot even lift.  So weak so weak :P
'Taste of revenge' something Uncle Roger will proudly say after getting revenge on Aunty Helen
Now I want chili jam 😋
Instashit 🤣 I love this guy
I saw the thumbnail and thought Uncle Roger dyed his hair blue
7:25 Uncle Roger needs to stop 😂
Nephew Guy is a delight.
Roger came to the factory just to roast it
Uncle Roger is gonna buy Chilli jam to put it in Aunty Helen's makeup
The episode was fun lol
When are you coming to India
FIRST!
Uncle Roger you should've brought MSG for them Haiyaa
So I can't even bring msg when I visit Uncle Roger, Haiya!!!
uncle and nephew look the same tho lol
Uncle Roger lifting and stirring skills so WEAK
Uncle Roger, you are going to Bangkok, so let see what you will bring back.
Lol this was fun. Chili jam doesn't look so bad. But still not for egg fried rice probably. 😋
Uncle Roger, nephew Nigel, why don't you come to Indonesia? You guys got a lot of fans from Indonesia. Uncle Roger also can have a lot of SASA MSG here. Haiya. 😋😋
The chilli jam looks like Thai sweet spicy sauce.
HAIIII YAHHH You already know once you step in,you can already feel the disappointment.       *tsk *tsk *tsk
Why those people not wear masks?
Petition for uncle Roger on hot-ones
Indonesia pls 🥲
oh my god chili jam uncle i am so disappointed
i fucking lost it when he pulled out the egg fried rice, that was good haha
Please come to the Netherlands! All the international students will flock to the location!

*Puts child to work in chilli jam factory*

Owner of the Chilli Jam Factory gives me a Luca Brasi feel from the Godfather
Why your tour no visit Singapore, lah?
welcome to hell on earth
Uncle roger: it’s go a nice kick to it. Him: showing a punch 🤜
LMAO imagine you become so famous the object you constantly make fun of want to collab with you for publicity lol.  Cool move.
Hi
How to know if you malaysian? Say KL beside kuala lumpur😂
No…. You joined the dark side
Give me a code for that company to get a discount for that chilli jam.
Are you going to tell me that chilli jam was inspired by Thailand Sauce?
That's a cool CEO 😂😎👍
This man roasted Uncle Roger the entire episode lol
3:41 he is the man of culture. Bois he wants sauce

Good sport these Chili jam people
must be fun to see you in KL but i'm in pahang rn.... i hope i'm at university in KL when you come
30% chili jam 70% comedy, love ur vids uncle Roger
Congratulations on the tour, Nigel!
Uncle Roger is on field trip yeay
Nice one nigel i like it
i wish i can go to kl to see you but don't have money to spare so sad
That was a fun video!
Lol I thought you dyed your hair blue like BTS
Chilli jam finally approved ☺️
M.S.G is natural. More natural than chilli jam.
I'm sure that the sales of chilli jam after uncle roger have collapsed, cooperation was the only way to survive
Why haven't we seen uncle Roger in a movie or series/ he needs to be brought in in with auntie Mary
Not coming to India huh 🤔 😤
Tastes like Revenge!  This was a great video!
1:40 "So weak your brand name!" Iconic!
this was lovely
Hai-yah!  Uncle Roger will need to have nephew Nigel explain everything to white people when touring USA and Canada. Show will take six hours to tell three jokes.  Maybe they let audiences bring something to read.
Instashit? Should be the new name for Jamie Oliver's 15 minute meals.
Nice uncle roger! Looking good...
The ceo is so funny i died 😂
Tio roger why u always talk about jamie oliver, jamie oliver this jamie oliver that…is there more going on behind camera?
Uncle Roger - this too much, Jason help. Me - haiyaaa...Uncle Roger, why so weak? Why so weak?
This guy is clearly a true uncle roger fan!
instead of hitting children, Uncle Roger might need to hit the weights
I love that he had to put a disclaimer for us to not bring him MSG as a gift. 😂🤣
NO JAKARTA?!?!?!?! THAT'S BS UNCLE ROG😤😤😤
Y no korea uncle
Uncle Roger so weak yet so strong
He said he got recipe from the trip to Bangkok, Thailand. Me a Thai  born and raise inBangkok who heard  "chilli jam" first time from Uncle roger reaction Video.  =_=
i'm still wonder if Uncle Roger and nephew Nigel is Doppelgänger or not 😳 ?!
When my unit came back from Thailand, most of them came back with the clap...
Finally see uncle roger work again  Good job good job 😁🥰
No mg in Philly  they 🛑🛑 u can't have it no more
Word of the day Hiyaaaaaaaa  PS: Wish uncle Roger was my real uncle
I feel like you’d make a killing in HK big British population tonnes of English speaking people modern and metropolitan sounds like your kind of city
Uncle roger so weak, so weaak!
omg i thought they were the same person
come to germany toooo :-(
No South Africa?
8:58 "you fuck with my rice I fuck with your life"
no more chilli jam bashing anymore huh? besides chilli jam is ok for egg fried rice, sugar and chill with vinegar in one go. not a Jamie Oliver fan here, but the shortcut was good, so use it next time you cook. auntie Helen won't know
I suspect thos guy will not be doing any more youtube partnerships
“Usually when people go to Bangkok or Thailand, They come back with wife” 😂 This is so true lmao.
imagine like kids think that they are both different people while seeing at 0:31 XD
Nike gonna sue you yeah maybe😂😂
@0:25 I was confused like uncle got a twin bro or something!?? 😶
That was a wholesome tour, now Asians who visit UK will be curious to buy “Tracklements” as souvenirs. Profit stonks for chili jam.
Are u going to Manila?
0:56 Crystal not powder
Bak kata pepatah melayu "tak kenal maka tak cinta"
Chili Jam company must've paid Uncle in millions to stop more market injuries from him.
MONTREAL NIGEL YOU HAVE TO COME TO MONTREAL
Uncle roger should go on Vegan diet Because He So Weak!
CEO is the boss
Uncle roger why no come Singapore……
Funny Nigel said the volume was all the same because clearly one of the nozzles was filling higher than the rest. I wonder if he noticed.
Why not visiting India
Do they also cook meth there?
I can't describe how awesome it is, that people tryed to bring MSG to a show
Nephew guy going to asian countries: "Give me sauce!!!"
I am surprised that they wear white laboratory outfit but don’t wear mask when in contact with the ingredients
This factory belongs to Jamie Oliver's father !!
Haha!! Uncle Roger so weak! So weak!
This is so absolutely excellent.
Nooo, I missed it. :(
Was not expecting a UK sauce exec to keep up with Uncle Roger.
I signed up! Can’t wait to see Nigel ( and Uncle Roger ) in the States!
Whatever marketing person at Treacklements made this happen deserves a raise. This was a very fun video.
now im Sad because i didnt hear you say India for the tour haiyaaahhhh 🤦
This guy gives off boris johnson vibes
Uh oh
Jason shut have sad: why so weak, why so weak😂
This video was actually a call for help because he was actually kidnapped by them
Philippines plz
♥☺♥
00:30 I know all Asians look the same but this is ridiculous!
Uncle roger why so weak why so weak can’t even pick up sugarrr
As much as that chilli jam starts to look nice to me, still wouldn't put it in my egg fried rice
Guy: ``Why Not Imagine Auntie Helen in there``  Uncle Roger: ``HAIYAAA You Gone done it Now``
Its feel better watching uncle Roger's video after stressing doing my assignment. 😂
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates. 🎈
So funny going to look now see if u going to be close live in Washington state.
Nice protective fedoras!
Nephew Guy looks like a very cute person😄😄
“Can y’all stop saying shit I didn’t say” - sun tzu , the art of war
Uncle roger loves twice i guess but who is his favorite twice member
This CEO guy is very funny and he has good humor, he even knows auntie Helen.
Come Singapore pls pls
Respect to the company owner, he lets this be a fun video, even though Uncle Roger says some negative/controversial jokes etc 😅 Not everyone would let Nigel publish such a video but this guy seems to understand the internet and has got any sense of humor 😆
Damn lie. Thats your son!
I’ve been waiting for this
hahahahaha thats a really cool boss. anyways why do i feel like this chilli jam is like salsa sauce for the uk? am i wrong?
Nice to see Theresa May, working at the packing plant ✅👌😂 being useful. 🙄
Next msg factory
This video feels illegal for some reason
The number of bots in the comments is almost as high as the number of STDs Aunty Helen has.
Finally KL
HAH, cHiLLy jAm FaCtOry???
HAIYAAAA! INDIA not asian enough for you? What you doin? WHAT YOU DOIN?  All jokes aside, Love you uncle Roger. You're videos make my heart go FUIYOOOOOH
I didn't even know chili jam is a thing until I watched uncle Roger reaction to Jamie Oliver lmao
Instashit. Exactly. Same as Twitshit
Nephew Guy is a cool guy.
One of best episodes.
I love how he always adds something related to k-pop in his videos
5:18 jAsON HeLPppp!!!! 😂😂😂
Why zojuryshi is so expensive? Is it worthy? Here in Brazil it is  250$ and other brands are like 50$
Chili jam looks very much like just Malaysian sambal.
that was a change of jam^^
He's pretty chill lol
Now i got to try out this tracklement chili jam.
bankcock..
Taste of revenge died laughing
Now I wanna try willy wonkas sauce ....wait 🤔😅😅
Come to India, Uncle Roger
Uncle Roger Jamie Oliver doesn't have anymore restaurants they all failed 😂
why no hong kong
That's big of them to collaborate with Uncle Roger. Buying a jar of chili jam in my next trip to the supermarket to try 😊
Uncle roger cant stir chilli jam. So weak.
hahahahahaha
“Haaaaaiya” 🦵 🤦🏻‍♂️
He talked shit about them so much there sales went down they had to bring him to show they not enemies  People dont get jokes
Plot twist : they are different person
(world tour) Haiyaaa no Philippines 😏
Chilli jam in thumbnail....and I immediately liked the video
No msg, but a lot of saliva😝, kept talking without mask🤪ヾ˚*̥(∗*⁰͈꒨⁰͈)*̥~
Man the banter is off the charts.      It's OVER 9000 MSGS!
What about japan
haiiyaaa you going to KL but no indonesia???? why no indonesia??? we"r neighboor
Also chilli jam is Jamie Oliver’s msg🤣
They will defo kill you in the chilli jam factory
Uncle Roger calls everyone weak but can't pick up a 10 kilo bucket. Hiyaaa....
💜💜💜 the sorry children jokes were on point in this video 🤣😂
5:18 why so weak?  so weak?
u look like my actual uncle but younger 😭✋🏽
What a very cool owner.
I love your "white" people jokes!!
when I saw chili jam It remind me of Thai sweet chicken sauce and I was right. Try chilli jam with fried chicken and you'll love it.
*Where I can get the Uncle Roger's chili jam handmade,haiyaaa?*
So weak 😂
I LOVE the fact that he’s in on all the jokes and just goes along with them 😂😭
He went to Bangkok to get some jam, not wife. ... 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
The problem isn't the chili jam, its just Jamie Oliver
Tracklements make the best tartare sauce!  Mmmm 😋 🧡
*Breaking News* Asian man blows up Chilli Jam factory with improvised explosives
Why you say UK tour when you only have dates in England? Why you not come to Scotland?
Uncle Roger banned from entering EU during world tour?
The English capturing nigel to work in a chilli jam factory
Haha this is a real funny video! And educational too! Never knew how chili jam was made! Thanks uncle!
This guy is a genius 🤓 Since Uncle Roger ruined the image of chilly jam. He invited him in his factory...
So…Guy been to Bangkok and he is impressed by Thai chili jam and  makes UK chili jam ???  Check this recipe “Nam Prik Pao” (Thai chili jam) it goes well with FRIED RICE !!
visit ur beloved MSG next time, I love you uncle (oji-sannnnnnnnnnn) >w<
Why is Philippines not part of the tkur hiyaahhh
No tour in Manila? Haiyaa!
