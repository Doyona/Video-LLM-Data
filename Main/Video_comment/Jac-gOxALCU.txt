This song represents emotions that most humans could never understand. But I can. Thanks to this song I was awakened to many things previously considered unimaginable. Thank you for this exquisite song.

The thing I like about this generation’s music is the honesty and vulgarity of song writing. Straight up just telling it how it is is sometimes better than using poetic language. It just hits different

one way is the most beautiful thing to ever lay my ears.. one way is a form of art i've never seen or rather heard before. its a masterpiece above all other forms of masterpieces.. it changed me. it turned my life around. it made me into a intellect or rather reach a level of intellect i could never have had any hope of reaching before my ears heard this beautiful song. it cured my depression, my pain, my sadness, my family problems.. everything has been lifted off my shoulders while listening to this masterpiece. benjamin c. phillips jr is a savior.. a different level of genius. hes changed this world , all humans he reached lives. my outlook on life itself has shifted...

Been a autumn fan since 2018 it’s feels good watching him blow again and again
pure creativity
love this song fr
Take is offf for me you know I 😘😘
Idk
😢
He’s the 🐐 of the underground scene rn nobody can take tht away from him . I’ve listened to him since he quit his job at Walmart to making Nina . he’s an artist but a heavily pluggnb artist which I love but this guy is really bigger than the entire underground rn not bc of the views but bc of the Versatility & great content. Autumn up next .
Being a Autumn fan isn't just a hobby, it's alifestyle, a reason to breathe, an escape from the cruel world filled with thieves. It's art, the first gift you open on Christmas, a hug from a loved one, everything you've ever wanted, everything you need. Thank You Benjamin C. Phillips Jr. for this music its power and greatness to my ears.
Autumn is my father 😅
“I don’t wanna waste no mo time” 😩
Everyone keep on saying this shit mid this shit got my in a corner and shit
What a masterpiece of music
Hey does anybody know the bpm for the song?
This shi got me crying bro 🥲
unpopular option No New Friends was better than One Way
I'm in my bag again 🚬
