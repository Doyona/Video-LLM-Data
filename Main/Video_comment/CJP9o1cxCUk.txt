Great vid 💪🏾
Peace be upon you. Believe in ALLAH (GOD) and the judgement day and do good deeds. Don't show non well covered women that will be better for you in this life and the hereafter.
so where the highlights at
Mane these ain’t no fucking highlights
This clearly said “highlights” sooooo where tf are the highlights ?
Camme here the hl but had to leave
I wanna see Izzy vs prime gsp.
Next time do this without all the talking
another fighter not hungry enough to cut the cage and make it grimy for that belt, and pieced up once again for 25 minutes putting people to sleep...
I feel like Izzy isn't as exciting anymore. He mainly throws jabs and leg kicks, not really bending many styles.
I💤y with another snoozefest
I just want the ducking highlights not this bullshit
Dude, if you don't have the ©️ to post real highlights, don't post anything, don't cheat with this shit.
I though cannonier would do better
Damn still the champ in the middle, get em izzy
Izzy was TOO WEAK to KO Connonier and had to rely on the judges. POOR PERFORMANCE once AGAIN from the Broken and BENT style wanna bee!
So jabs and leg kicks feints and circle out he's a point fighter now
Did you see any highlights =?????????
Bro literally showed 2 clips and calls these highlights🤦🏽‍♂️
Ya ufc bloqueo el contenido el Yt por lo que veo
dont name the video as if its gonna be a highlight video when its just some narrated bullshit with minimal content sprinkled in
You doing all this talking in videos , just show the highlights
I like how everyone says "Izzy is just running away and using his reach advantage".. Like it would make more sense for him to not play to his advantages, ignore them and just jump head first into smaller guys with more power? Just so he can display how many hits he can take? There are weight classes for a reason, if they want the belt, they should go get it, not Izzy's fault if they drop on the way to it.
Where are the highlights ?
Good pm😍🎻😘🌸
It blows my mind how people are influenced so easily by hype and therefore latch on and follow the bandwagon. As much as I do believe Adesanya has some skills, he is totally beatable. The minute the ufc puts the right opponent before him who can't be psyched out by his hype, we'll all see the holes. It's only a matter of time.
I still don’t get why someone 15-5 even got a title shot
TROLL CONTENT FAKE VIDEO
Not to mention his French Manicure!!  😂
I dont like cheats like Adesenya who uses drugs to win ,a big cheat
Num falha!!!
I hate wrestling thts y I love watching adesanya
Is it just me or does style bender look super way more feminist
I💤y 😴
I knew this would be a complete sleeper boring asf
i really hope izzy beats the shit out of alex...not cuz of alex cuz hes cool but boy the hate on izzy is real strong in almost every ufc convo....let the dude have fun man....
What song is playing in the background?
This is how I saw the fights Sean vs Alex - beginner vs a master Volk vs max - master vs a expert  Izzy vs cannon - two girls play fighting
Mean Adesanya Mean I loved the Pukana you did Israel after they put your UFC  champion belt on your waste KIA KAHA ISRAEL ADESANYA 💪😎
Funny title
great video, you earned a new subscriber
Adesanya is the most boring fighter I really don’t understand how anyone likes his fighting style UFC needs to find a way to get rid of him maybe Alex Pereira🤞
Just play the entrance. That’s the highlight😂
Respect
Clickbait his mother
Why not just allow us watch, instead of this boring comments 😒
where is the highlights buddy
Damn I missed this match
Bro looked like he just ran outside to grab something out of the car not a scratch 😬
Fucking fucking fucking YouTube. FIX your fucking algorithms
Third straight snooze fest.
I won't watch anyone that says "creativeness" instead of "creativity."  Education ftw
Izzy tko’d the fans
Somebody better come up with a game plan for those thunderous leg kicks, if not, those strikes will keep landing hard.
Who gives a shit? - bleh...
Chuck liddell in his prime against Izzy now would be insane.
izzy still the queen of the middleweights

Honestly man post just the highlights no one wants to hear you talk
Never watching a ppv again
Yo he put eveyone to sleep
Very interesting video. Thank you)
I actually liked the jabs but Jared needed to go forward. Izzy still the least touched champ crazy 😂
bro ruined the vid talking, no one wants to hear you bro
Adesanya fights are a waste of 60 dollars every single time, and people call him the most entertaining fighter and meat-ride him. I’ve gotten more worth out of my hard earned cash by buying tickets to space jam II
Finally someone gave the credit the champ deserve
It is surprising how many humans do not feel they have the divine right to experience an abundant life. This is so sad, when you consider that true abundance isn't something bought, or given, it is something that is shared. Till at last we rise forever in the arms of perfect love.
His walk out was his biggest highlight but he still couldn't do enough to put him away in the urn
Great video and analysis Stylebender is the greatest to ever do it!
Congrats Stylebender!
Highlights of a sparring session. Izzy came in as the Undertaker because he bet the under on strikes landed.
talk talk and no video....poor!
He did not beat Yoel he basically ran from him and did not engage.
Shit video, not highlights -
What highlights
stone hands is coming... i like izzy but DAM alex is a humble scary mf
You talk too much.
It's boring but effective, however he has no equally rivals in style, reach, and size. Alex Pereira is gonna beat him, Adesanya is gonna get out of his confort zone
Some advice stopping talking so much in your videos we dont wanna hear you we wanna watch the highlights if you even call this BS highlights
Why the commentry MF
0:51 that undertaker entrance though💯🐐
Izzy vs Jon Jones should happen 💯
Izzy is a dog
Stop posting nonsense here again
Isreal is a badass
Yoel really did a full split with jeans on?
He is not undefeated. Blachowiz,
Alex Pereira might just knock izzy out again dont sleep he is knocking on the door.
The undertaker intro is crazyyyyy Lmaoo 😭😭😭😭
This channel is #1 bullshit. Didn't show anything you know the viewers wanted and the narrator sounds like he's just reading a script like a robot.
wtf where's the highlights? ots just pure talking waste of time..click bait
thanks a lot bro
Want to be a like adesanya? Go learn how to dance 😉
If its not for izzy fighting a person of upper weight class...he is still undefeated
Why they break out into a Dance off and the end of the video.🤣
THUMBS DOWN
really hope izzy clears his division so we can see izzy vs jones
Congratulations style bender on your W
This is no highlight sucker...dont recommend this channel checked
f u
Same punch that's catching em all, left hook is lethal, so well timed he's bad ass alright, good luck to Poatan but I'm with Izzy till the end 🤪😝👀
Always just mute these things damn son i just want to watch the highlight reel
Why are Adesanya finger nails so long and glossy.  Is there no rules about the length of finger nails for concern of eye poke damage?
Unsub
Ngannou👀
Worst highlight video I’ve ever seen
Adesanya game says it's all boring and not funny. That's why Whitaker is more popular than you.
Izzy is a great fighter, just not an entertaining one.
Actually something good when click the bait.
well Perriera of course
Thanks 4 the upload
Bruh L vid

👍👏
Y’all found highlights?
