Russian is unstoppable ❤
Zelensky is a vile person who is refusing to end the war for personal gain.
A lot of young ukrainians are already in Europe, they don't give a sh t about Ukraine and Zelensky is begging from usa😂😂😂
New Berlin
i wanna know how russia got 5 miles away from the president house and today they got push back all the way close to the border between ukraine and russia
And nearly 2 years later, we now know that those weren't Russian tanks but instead some rogue Ukrainian units in the streets of Kyiv.
This is a Strela only used by Ukraine, not Russia
That's not a tank
So obviously these are films of not undestroyed Russian tanks not rumbling into not Kiev. As unreported by BBC CNN UK united zMedia. Innocents behind tanks eith hands ied behind backs are getting not murdered after non torture. Snd Biden is a person of character. Not
Looking back those russian must have been lost as fuck
,🤣🤣🤣🤣
Where were the "tanks filmed entering Ukraine's capital Kyiv"? I didn't see a single tank.
Glory to mother Russia ✌ 👍 🙏 🇷🇺
Kiev, not Kuiv, bich
Лол це українська техніка Стріла-10, один із засобів ППО 🤦‍♂️
🇺🇦🇺🇸🇪🇺
Watch out they are coming boy!
I don't understand anything..zelensky talks about what goes in Victoria in Victoria..but what is the truth?  They are already in the same capital of Ukraine!  And zelensky like Hidden Hitler asking his People to win and resist even if it is by throwing bottles of Gasoline at them... they make me between 😄 and 😭 just like the Egyptian president and the coalition in 1967 told their Peoples and the World through the written press and on the radio and on television that they were winning the war against Israel and the truth was another...zelensky was a liar and coward like Hitler...Hiding safely asking his people to sacrifice for freedom and sovereignty...when he is more of a slave from the "west" that put him where he IS to execute what these cowardly do not risk doing ... and worst of all, he enslaves his people to die not for their country ... but for other interests
Poor b washed western liers and it's fellow blind sheeps voters. This title totally not corresponding with reality, just like the lies the military actions didn't start 2014, but 2022. The closest point to the capital Kiev that Russian troops came to was Gostomel city - 25 KM away from the capital. The airport Antonov located in Gostomel was the target Russian forces seized. Did not even attempted to raid the capital. The military vehicle seen on most the mainstream medias presented for "russian tank abusing and hitting cars in Kiev" aside the fact isnt a tank, it's not russian one. This the self-propelled air defense complex " Strela / Arrow " operated by Ukrainian military. Sadly not only they hitting its own citizens but shot dead tens of civilians on the outskirts while they attempting to get out of the city. The most frustrating tragedy was a whole family with a toddler inside the car being shot dead and blown up by " territorial defense" pseudo heroes with free out of control given weapons . Every single case with dead civilians inside Kiev and on its outskirts on Ukrainian record.. simply because russian troops never attempted to storm the city..
🤦🏻‍♂️😩 Naught Boy  Putin it's its 2023 now still war on
No worries, we kicked their assses, they are all dead now !!! Hello rom Ukraine! )
Sergey Lavrov , another idiot ex. leather in Putin Mafia talk like an animal , thinking something in Ukraine belong to them ( or all Ukraine , who knows ). all Russians nowdays looking , behave , thinking like they are now un USSR times ( passed long ago) . Russia is a country of dombs , only Propaganda tv by Putin , still another idiot ,  want be like Stalin or Peter (dreams). all world just waiting to see the finish of this Russia desaster cruel goverment . Slava Ukraine , Glory to Ukraine fighters , i am with you 100% , Michael from Tel-Aviv , Israel.
А в итоге там укр
Fake caption.. It's a Ukrainian tank. No Russian military unit ever entered Kiev

Watching this in October after the Russians have just been chased out of Lyman. This war is such a waste of time. We're all cheering for Ukraine and its amazing resolve.

Can anyone explain how Russian tank can enter Kyiv? Absolutely brainwashing western media. Where is V, Z or O?
Ukrainian Challenge "We're Coming...!!! Zelinsky..."
It's June now and this turned out to be bullshit..... just like everything else you have said BBC.
This was a ukrainian AA
imagine the families being torn apart because you're being barred from leaving and being forced to fight for a country that's doomed to lose
more media lies.. if you think thats  a lone Russian personnel carrier scootin around kiev, then you're a fool
So why has the BBC not corrected this yet? Those were Ukrainian vehicles firing on each other.
Next London)))

BBC did I just hear citizens 18 to 60 told not to leave the city, Why???? are this not the same civilians that Zelensky is using as cannon fodder. smh
Yes . After Ucraninans Neo-Nazi killed so many thousands of civilians in Mariupol and the region of Bonbas, now Russians have to go to fight the Neo Nazis to exterminate the killers of civilians in Kivk. Now here are really real Ucraninans that’s why they are leaving but they didn’t let to leave people the Ucraninans Nazis the people of Donbass. Zelensky ask for continuing the war. He doesn’t want peace.
This is no tank, it is ukrainian strela 10 system
Russian tanks without Z letters? Bullshit, this is Ukrainian tanks
4weeks after the war started and Russians still haven't reached the capital, so was this the Ukrainian military committing atrocities against their own people?
USA GO HOME

*Fake news!* All armored units in first part on the video it's ukrainian! We can to see AA self-propelled system 9K35 (old version, only in ukrainian army) 00:10 00:18 and 00:28 ukrainian new recon armored car "Varta".
This is the Ukrainian "Arrow" there are not even identification signs there. Come to your senses! You are being rubbed with fakes!
Please take a look! Come to your senses! They're lying to you! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPG6oxa1-Gg&t=163s
You take the audience for idiots
the tank was a Ukrainian shopping mall, the Russian army is not there, yet
Мне интересно а где Украинские солдаты с джаволинами чтобы очень быстро уничтожить этот танк? Это что какая то шутка?
YOU WANT ME to BELIEVE THAT RUSSIA IS ONLY BOMBING schools and hospitals and nursery and apartment buildings and shopping centers AND BOMBING NO SOLDIERS.....if they are targeting those places its because ZELENSKI Gave CIVILIANS 18,000 weapons like AK 47 AND STINGER'S and they are shooting out of these places .Civilians think they are protecting the people inside these places and that what makes them targets for Artillery or they wouldn't WASTE THE AMMO... In Israel terrorist hide ammo, missiles 'and weapons in the very places they are bombing its just PROPERGANDA
In fourth week now and Russians are still getting the shit kicked out of them
FAKE NEWS! Das ist ein Ukrainischer Panzer! KEIN Russischer!
its not Russian tank or vehicle as no markings on it. But it says u have in town itself military hardware which is  legitimate target in war and its driving along civilian vehicles which is just a reminder that Ukrainians are not paying much attention to civilian safety. If bomb fell on that vehicle all would cry its war crime instead asking Ukrainians wtf they are doing in dens populated areas with military hardware.
Is that bus filled with Russians
All Biden and Zelensky can do is LIE and KILL. Where there are these two people, there will be no peace...

Fuk Putin, Lukashenko and China.
These tanks are send in to die, to wear out the Ukraine's. To exhaust their antitank missiles, resources, planes, soldiers lives, everything, moral etc. After that, they move in with their most capable weapons, "Hammer Blow" and win the war. Putin is a willy old fox🦊!
This is not a Russian tank. The letters "z" and "v" are painted on Russian armored vehicles. This is the Strela-10 anti-aircraft missile system, which has long been decommissioned in Russia and is used by the Ukrainian army. The incident took place on February 25, when there were no Russian troops in the city of Kyiv, as they are not there yet. This video shows how the Ukrainian military is destroying their own people in order to blame Russia for it later, and the Western media are helping to spread lies.
Cancer holder
No Russian Markings, No "O" ,or V or Z. BBC, YOU"RE so fake. YOU BELONG IN A DUST BIN, YOU ARE RUBBISH.
Looking for all my russiha friends
How do you know that this is Russian tank? It's not even marked. Maybe this is Ukranian tank hidings in city with civilians.
This tank is terrorist without sign. Russian will give up and Ukrain has flag.
The Russian and Ukrainian forces use practically the same AFVs. Can't see the 'Z' or any other military mark that are painted on the Russian vehicles. So is it possible that we are not seeing what we are told we are seeing?
video 12days ago, russians still not in kiew...dont worry i forget human mistakes
Fox nor CNN don't show are the truth, just some truth however Russia did not only bomb civilians they did bomb Ukraine airforces with surface to air missiles and military also U.S. news only show when Ukraine shoots one Russian tank but they don't show the 50 Ukraine tanks Russia destroyed the American news reports are too one sided to say the truth.
3 min in is litterally footage from the Brad Pitt movie World War Z...😌😂😵 WAKE UP People

thats an ukrainian tank, russia doesn't send anti air vehicles ahead of the entire force to roam alone through kiev streets, you absolute imbeciles
All the russian bots in the comments telling people they are Ukrainian tanks 😂😂😂 god they're desperate
Russia and Ukraine had excellent relations until Madame Nuland and Senator McCain arrived in Kyiv. We know who quarreled these countries and it is not Russia.
BULLSHIT!!
Where is the Z sign on that tank?
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
They all have reports (FAKE)  combined with footage from 2015, isn't that funny, This tank is from 2015, we've seen the footage before, BBC doesn't care, Ukraine pays them well!
FAKE NEWS....KIEV is peaceful, NO WAR, The MSM is Corrupt, paid by Ukraine...you do the thinking..
The court in The Hague scorched Kyiv, an investigation into the genocide in Donbass. A preliminary report by the International Criminal Court, published in December 2020, found that there were “reasonable grounds to believe that a number of war crimes were committed during these years from 2014 to December 2020, including murder, rape, torture, illegal detention and deliberate attacks on civilians. " Ukraine kills Ukrainians, its own people .. Ukraine has started a war with Russia, and Ukrainians have massacred Russians in Donbass - says Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova
Pure lie. There are no Russians in the center of Kyiv. Russian tanks have the inscription Z   The Russians surrounded Kyiv.
I supports Peace Process for both Parties and Pray for Russia and Ukraine
Footage showing helicopters flying over cars without shooting them, and unmolested traffic jams, reflects that Russia is not targeting civilians.
Lol u r funny. This is not Russian tank. It's Ukraine anti aircraft strela 10
Who permitted to kill the innocence.
International community you suck
No no no that is an Ukrainian 9K35 Strela-10 (SA-13 Gopher)
"filmed entering kiev"........" miles north of the capital"   ...the usual fake news huh  lol
Thats not a Russian tank, Its a ukranian vehicle, Russian vehicles move around in groups what would one vehicle do so far alone in a hostile country, Stupid propaganda journalism by bbc what a joke. Its an anti air strella its the vehicle involved in driving over their own citizen who was breaking martial law.
So sad 😪 God have mercy on the the people
That first tank be like “F your lawn,I came all this way to rip turf”
fake news
I will 40 days just how Iraq was bomb  to sh33t by west.. I tell u russian  weak lik3 u all insinuating.  Its hard to trick the mind   when  things does not  make sense anymore what is happening  around you  then  are  consumed  hopelessness
Show Ukraine fighting  not just fire ball editing propaganda. I will believe u news
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP7wVHBRyhw
Uk cant fight with russia becoz russia is powerfull , and uk should surrender against russia👍
After a week, does anyone explained this was an aged anti-air armour from Ukraine army?
This video is fake 🤬🤬🤬🤬
This is not tank but anti aircraft system 9K35 Strela and belongs to Ukraine. You are spreading lies.
Why the west was not worried for Uyghur People in China getting killed tortured, Azerbaijan Karabakh, Rohingya people in Far East. Afghanistan, Lybia, Iraq and Syria, Palestine. But seem to be worried for Ukraine because they are Christians !!!
LIARS. Those armored vehicles are Ukrainian.
Zelensky is a Dumb Comedian Actor President of Ukraine.  He is responsible for death of innocent people in Ukraine
Это украинский танк , в России этой старой техники нет давно списали

THOSE ARE UKRAINIAN TANKS  Russian tanks have a white "Z" or "V"  painted all over them. Stands for "West" or "East". Russian troops wear white or red arm bands as well. Those are Ukrainian tanks most likely setting up for the invasion, because they have no markers that would indicate them being Russian. Russian tanks and infantry have these markers in order to distinguish themselves.

PUTIN SUCKS
Hope Ukraine destroys Russian Army!!
This is a tank of Ukraine, the anti-air defense of Ukraine...in Russia, this is not used because it is considered obsolete. Don't lie to the world!
Poutine STOP Your invasion in Ukraine. Keep our children FREE!!! -----> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQza7eub32o Thanks to share this vidéo. All in solidarity with the Ukrainian people!!!
I wish ukraine goodluck, push back those invaders!
Just let Russia 🇷🇺  take over  ..NO.ORE KILLING  AND DISTROING THE CITY PEACE ✌
This is not russian tank. Its strela10 short range airdefence vehicle soviet production, that is not in use in russian army for years...this one is Ukraine army vehicle. stop spreading fake news
Zelensky must step down as president in Ukraine. Or surrender to Russia and seek consensus for his safety. If he believe that international media can do something in favor to him by  painting Putin as the Villain. I think he has a wrong assumption. Putin is a brilliant leader, he has a valid reason to do such action, and knew also that at the end victorious will be on his side. Now Ukrainian president even you are  begging help from U.S, or NATO, I don't believe U.S agree about your request. Remember, if you love your country and people, agree to Putin condition to avoid more nightmare inside Ukraine. You cannot matched up the military power of Russia, you are alone to solve your problem. Don't wait that your military Generals, deliver you to Putin, rather than to witness, that their soldiers dying under there command in a no match war.
U wonder why they call u B. This war to me is a highschool bully fighting a 3rd grade nerd. Calm ur nerves Russia. We were not born with hate in us. Only love. We learn to hate

Funny how "russian tank" unarmed entered kiev while all the russian forces are so far away. Never seen so much fake sht in one day. Guys, please, before trust in this garbage, check more sources
those arent tanks? a tank is a specific design. you guys are making it worse by not saying what it was
America and European Union excuse Russia military action by imposed sanctions as open eyes and dare gut to loot Russia huge assets and wealth in America and western countries
in fact that America excuse anti-terrorism to aggression middle east countries over twenty years, at least fighting with Russia and Ukraine over ten years to end of war, Russia is not alone fighting for America and European Union
Putin is a demon 😈

Ukraine hold your ground you have proved that the Russian Army is not worth two hoots. i am sure that the russian foreign minister has been produced by spitting image.
I'm not sure how a barely armored anti-air vehicle with zero defensive capability was allowed to walk into an environment with zero cover and 6 possible directions to be attacked from, but it's an embarrassment for Russia.
BBC are scum
BBC is the biggest corrupt, lying, misleading and hypocritical corporation out there.
It's time too stand up and be counted , the USA, Europe and all NATO countries , put an end to this once and for all . Most countries in the world wants this cruelty from Putin to stop, even the Russian   people want this to stop , be on the right side of history and stop this  genocide
For every Ukrainian citizen (local or traveler), please stay safe and may God be with all of you. I'm sorry this is happening to you. ✌😔💙
PEOPLE ARROUND THE WOLRD PLEASE UNITE AND INFORM THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING! PLEASE UNITE TO STOP A MAD LEADER MAKE US ALL CRY. WAKE UP PLANET EARTH. PLEASE !!!!! OPEN YOUR EYES !!!! -I appologise for posting this on your channel but THIS IS REAL.
Putin = hitler that's how history will tell you
The only problem is that tank was not in Kyiv.
Fake News !!! Even the Major of Kiev Mr. Klitschko says there are no solders enter kiev !!! Your news are propaganda at all

STOP LYING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’ve seen how good Russians are at steering tanks so I don’t think they’ll be there for a few days at least. And if they try to trailer the tanks there it’ll be a month.
FAKE!!!! BBC F**K YOU!!!!! YOU SUPPORTED WAR!!!!! ON FIRST VIDEO NOT RUSSIAN TANK!!! DON'T  BE STUPID, ASK YOUSELF, WHY ONLY ONE TANK??? IT'S UKRANIAN DEFENDERS IN CITY!!!!
LOL i believe nothing of what i am being told. I believe we are in a post journalism age.
but why Putin?
The EU and its US ally in Asia sided with Ukraine. But not the rest of the world, we will remain neutral, we understand well why Russia has to. NATO has ignored too many warnings, although aggression is wrong, protecting national security is the most important thing. Many other countries know NATO well, the US is the aggressor, try to find out if the wars from 1950 to 2020 mostly belong to the US and NATO with the silly reason of democracy, human permission. Who wants democracy when the country is devastated. But they are rich and powerful, and no country dares to speak out.  About the promise not to expand nato to the east, nato does not fulfill the promise, it brazenly deceives, nato is to blame for everything, Nato expansion to the east is a direct threat to Russia and other countries

I just can't see how short video of one tank without any recognitional signs is a proof thats its a Russian tank and not Ukrainian. If u turn on critical thinking and not emotions,  90 % of the information on this subject is questionable, and can be twisted from both sides. What one single tank is doing close to houses? Where is the rest of the line? One single tank cant just leave the troop and go wherever it wants, that make non sense, I am sorry. Not saying that people are safe and nothing happening, but  what exactly happening is a big question.
Busdriver: next stop London
The Russian government are scum
bbc are scum this video is 6 years old
Hh all fakes
Not too much scary like US invasion in Iraq and Afghanistan
The Ukraine government claiming to be democratic and not like Russia are forcing all men to fight. They have put the life of the civilians at stake as they have also been designated as hostiles by the Russian military. The tank running over the vehicles was clearly a warning to the civilians.
Russia acha ugomvi
it's a ukrainian strela-10
Not sure about this one, I saw this video I think day two of the invasion already, definitely should fact check this.
Peace and freedom immediately to Ukraine.
russia marks there tanks jeeps etc with Z that is ukraine donkey.
err thats ukraine tank.
Zelensky has been assassinated
ложь
lol and civilians walking around and buses and cars, stop with the lies this all fake
Ukraine came under seduction of usa and NATO. This mess is self created.
🇺🇸 and NATO are equally responsible for this mess.
I actually find Putin's excuse more valid than that Israel uses when it attacks and invades Palestine!
what kind if reporting is this
Same pictures again and again. It seems there is no new footage, or its not what they want us to think.
Metro 2033
It’s Ukrainian vehicle !!! Don’t layer the people , of Corse I don’t won’t war jest inform the thrust plis !!!! Thank you !

That’s a Ukrainian tank lol
I keep on getting $19,000 every week from a new trading platforms in town.
Fuck nato!
I’m from Ukraine and hope this ends sooner or later. Thank god for Russia for helping us and saving our families and children. We escaped thanks to their busses and are residing in Russia now. But our friends are still there. I hope Russia can help end this and eliminate the nazi ukranian military after everyone they’ve slaughtered
This russians APCs will find their way... melted in the next Ukraine foundry! Slava Ukraine!!  support from Rio Grande.
Rescue and rehabilitation
Keep pushing into Eastern Europe, NATO.  Don't think that Western interests are blameless here.
18 to 60 thats not freedom that communism  forcing people to stay and fight
Alot of this footage is from the on going war that been going on in ukraine  most of these videos are from thewar in 2020. Even ones that MSM outlets putting out is old footage. Wtf is going on?
I’m from Scotland and this is horrible no one deserves this,there should be more hand shaking than people killing 🇺🇦🤝🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿

Go Wolverines!
If it wasn’t for Russia you Brits would be speaking German.
It's lie! This is ukranian vehicle
Its funny how the world reacted differently when US invaded and killed millions in Iraq. Those countries protesting the war joined forces with US and killed innocent human beings in Iraq. This war is not just another war it just shows how dirty the world is.
Could Taiwan be the next
The US news is saying the Russians are loosing, so how are armored vehicles in the capital if they are loosing?

(I Share with you the way of Life and Truth and i share it like a Gift you can take it, or throw it away) When something continues to happen for more than one generation, the new generation  considers  the norm and they start thinking this is how its supposed to be, this is why Islam is teaching you, to question your faith, when you know that there is something wrong here, you feel there is something wrong, you question it in order to find the answer that is correct, this is how people come on the right path So dont be afraid Islam has the answers.  ( The belief, Islam In short form) The belief in One God, One Creator, Allah = The only one worthy of whorship, allone and there is nothing like Him. This Creator send us guidens, In form of Prophets like, Abraham/Ibrahim, Moses/Musa,Jesus/Isa , Muhammad  ﷺ  and many more, peace be upon all of them. The belief in all Angels and Books like the Original  Zabur/Psalms, Tora/Tawrat, the Gospel/Injil and the Quran.  The belief in the Day of Judgement and the Hereafter. To believe in all of them and that Muhammad  ﷺ  Is the last and final Prophet and the Quran the last and final revelation from Allah, until Judgement Day. By following and believing in all of  these, you are a Muslim = The one who submits to the will of the Creator.  The evidance for this belief are the Quran and the Hadith, you can check both and study it and  listen to those who done it, to understand this  believe better and to learn more about it.   Maybe you have a bad picture about Muslims and Islam  from things that you heard or seen in the media, but isn't it better to make your own picture, before judge about something ? I'm sure you will discover a new side of Islam, a side of beauty and peace, kindness and compassion, you just have to allow it <3.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9np1b4C3XnE / Medina as Non Muslim - Solo Travel in Saudi Arabia  May Allah guide you Insha´Allah. Quran 17:15 - Whoever is guided is only guided for [the benefit of] his soul.

So bear in mind these tanks have been in the city for 2 days unless they are moving at 1 mile a day how can it not be taken over
This is a mainstream media invasion... Not an actual invasion
back in the early 2000s there were docs released that showed Putin had some unique personality issues the then intelligence agencies found alarming.... he was willing to take extreme risks. the greater the consequences, the bigger the risks.  those docs are probably still on the interweb.  I believe he believes he will die or become invalid before his work is done.
All BBC news footage from social media lol. Why do you even exist if you can't send a single reporter to a war zone?
Ukraine tank you liars. Western bullshit
Scene: *the Putin household in an imagined near-future.* Putin’s partner: “Good day at work, dear?” Putin: “Oh, you know. Just authorised the launch of enough nuclear weapons to incinerate the planet five-times over, that’s all.” Putin’s partner: “Oh, that’s nice. More tea, dear?”😩
This is the BBC though, so they could be ice cream vans entering the Sahara.
Dania i Szwecja wysyła pociski przeciwpancerne dla Ukrainy to się Putin wkurzy, a mówił że jak inne kraje zdecydują się działać na szkodę Rosji to zrobi coś takiego czego jeszcze w historii nie było. Coś mi się wydawaje ze wojna będzie na całą Europe, ukraina to tylko początek
Russiaj must lose. Putin is idiot.Bulgaria with Ukraine
Putin is Destroying the Cabal & USA Bio Labs. STOPPING Child/Human trafficking, Sale of Babies and Human Body parts. The Truth will be made clear soon.

I am from India and i don't want any country to war please stop this war there is no profit except loss a deadly loss please stop this #avoidwar
Its wonderful to see and hear how you, the BBC, turn upside down the reality on the information of news!!!. V. Zelenski has been during the last 8 years killing people of Donbas!!!, and as it’s up to date, he shall be taken to a trial for crimes of war on civilians!!!. And how BBC stands for a new war in Europe, thanks to Biden and the NATO, and of course the narco B. Johnson from 10 Downing St.!!!
Pray to God for Ukrainians!
Hello chauvinist racists Europeans and Americans. I am Russian. And I'm studying psychology. I love psychology, it can explain the actions of a person and even entire states. Even the structure of a multicellular organism is similar to the structure of a state as a complex system. People compete and fight for better jobs, working conditions, comfortable housing, transport, food and more. States behave in the same way. There will always be contradictions. Everyone's conditions are different. It is a fact. We are all different. Whites, blacks, Russians, Americans. There will always be disagreements. And there will always be those who will lead others. Such is the evolution of any system. As for the situation in Ukraine. In February 2014, radical nationalists seized power in Kyiv militarily. There were hundreds of victims. These nationalists began to suppress any resistance in all areas of the country. They burned alive the opposition in the house of trade unions in the city of Odessa. Around that time, the inhabitants of the Crimean peninsula held a referendum on joining Russia. After that, the nationalists and the military of Ukraine announced an "anti-terrorist operation" and began an invasion of the seceded territories of the southeast of the country - the Donbass. However, they met resistance. And since then, they have been constantly fighting and shelling against the inhabitants of the self-proclaimed republics of Donbass. Announcing to the whole world that they are holding back the Russian threat and protecting Europe. At the beginning of the year, the President of Ukraine complained about Ukraine's lack of nuclear weapons. This continued until February 24 of this year. The government of the Russian Federation announced the start of a special operation on the denazification and demilitarization of Ukraine. I live on the border with Ukraine and witnessed shelling from the territory of Ukraine. And the movement of Russian troops towards the border. I pray to God for the success of the Russian military and peace with Ukraine. All peace and prosperity!
Same happened in Armenia!  🙁
Y don't the leader itself fight it self like man, instead of sending those innocent soldiers.
Fake 🤥 News BBC😂😂😂😎
Свои операции надо было так освещать, нашлись моралисты!
Us,NATO! Don't you invade enough countries!Yugoslavia,Iraq,Libya, Syria, Afghanistan.Don't they have human rights and freedoms!You slaughtered innocent people all over the world. Now you are stirring up war between Russia and Ukraine,your evil deeds will be judged by Jesus oneday
Это украинская стрела, она два дня там кошмарит
7 Вооруженные силы России не наносят никаких ракетных, авиационных или артиллерийских ударов по городам Украины: высокоточными средствами поражения выводятся из строя военная инфраструктура, объекты ПВО, военные аэродромы и авиация.  гражданскому населению ничего не угрожает.
Stop the war
Английское БРЕХЛО! В Российской армии такие самоходки давно списаны и НЕ СОСТОЯТ на вооружении РФ!
Where is NATO  Allied don't dare to attack Russia but crushed Iraq
Dead of usa
Is the entire European continent pacifist?    Russians are now waging war IN Europe.  Help your neighbors!
What about Donbass? Whrere 8 years ukrainian army and neonazi organisation killing donbass people. 8 years all does'nt see this, but see as kiliing Ukrainian army and "stop war".  Europe - THIS BLOOD IS ON YOUR HANDS, YOU supplied weapons there, and prepared for war with Russia. You lured her into NATO. YOU supported the Ukrainian government in everything, you made it anti-Russian. So it's you Europe and the United States staged this war and this blood is on your hands. And on your conscience.
Ewe mwenyezi MUNGU mkuu
I am from India. Pls stop the war and save innocent people.
Don’t forget about Iraq and Palestine what goes around comes around
I hope you learned a lesson not to support other people invading other countries like you support the invasion of Iraq or your support for  Israel against the Palestinians I hope you learn your lesson and stop being a mercenary and see this shit is happening to you, what Goes around comes around.
Putin is a murder.  But this is Biden pushed it.  Biden help China and Russia united together. This is big mistake. Biden, you made  many mistakes for our country and world. Biden and Democratic get out DC.  The China is much evil than Russia. We need to take power away from China first then Russia. President Reagan is super smart. He know how crushed communist.
I hope you learned a lesson not to support other people invading other countries like you support the invasion of Iraq or your support for  Israel against the Palestinians I hope you learn your lesson and stop being a mercenary and see this shit is happening to you, what Goes around comes around.
Most Russian tanks were stopped from entering - and when one gets in, it is incinerated in minutes by angry locals. Putin is a terrible military strategist. He thought they'd storm the airports and invade with ground troops. Epic fail - and there is no plan B. Morale is already TERRIBLE for Russian soldiers who don't want to be there.

Fake news!
UKRIANE handed over their nuclear weapons because of a lie .Now look at them .Never trust NATO .This is proof .If UKRAINE had kept 10 % Of its nuclear arsenal then they would have never been taken over
Fake News. Those are ukrainian tanks. How unprofessional are you?
This is UA tank..not russian.Stop posting bullshit.
Zelenskyy is corrupt , Rus is not even bombing ukraine he wont do that , like hitler did , sending 100 bomb planes same time, why putin dont do that ?
BBC you are faking corrupt MEDIA  controlled by CORRUPT ELITE GO TO HELL ALL
Zelenskyy misendeavor has already produced much hardships in lives of Ukrainian and many people accross the world. He mustn't try to provoke world and jeopardise the world peace for your own ambition.
Zelenskyy is corrupt , Rus is not even bombing ukraine he wont do that , like hitler did , sending 100 bomb planes same time, why putin dont do that ?
this is air defense, strela
Russians ( this is not russians ) in single military vehicles driving in the middle of Kiev without any reinforcements. ??? strange dont you think and this happened first day they invaded ...hmmm
WHERE WERE YOU FOR 8 YEARS WHILE UKRAINE WAS KILLING RUSSIANS IN THE DONBASS. WHILE UKRAINIAN SNIPERS WERE SHOOTING CHILDREN, DOCTORS AND TEACHERS.
ГДЕ ВЫ БЫЛИ 8 ЛЕТ ПОКА УКРАИНА УБИВАЛА РУССКИХ НА ДОНБАСЕ. ПОКА УКРАИНСКИЕ СНАЙПЕРЫ РАСТРЕЛИВАЛИ ДЕТЕЙ , ВРАЧЕЙ УЧИТЕЛЕЙ.
this is not russian tank , this the same tank who destroyed car , this happened first day when russains came , they are not even inside first day , and this is anti missile tank , dont uses for invasion but defensive vs planes and helicopters , why the hell is this fake russian tank dryving alone inside kiyv ? and all Russian tanks are Z-marked
Это украинский трактор. В армии РФ таких давно нет.
fake info
Fake news! Funnily enough, now the BBC  website front-page article by Owen Amos two full days later claim they are NOT in Kyiv yet! BBC mouthpiece for corrupt Ukraine government.
If Russia keeps going this hard and brutal, they will face hard times themselves, the European and International answer will follow for sure. We (the EU) will support the Ukraine, i believe in the end also with active military support and force against russian troops, to stop and limit this cruel war. Very sad indeed, but that's the world we live in and that's what the EU had "gambled" with by not listening to Putins words clearly enough in the first place. Let's hope and "pray" that this doesn't evolve into a big, unnecessary and bloody 3rd world war...the price is already too high, innocent people are dying for this senseless act.
The footage with the tank was made in 2014 not now.
Лживый BBC, это украинский танк
where BBC hide when Israel behaves like Russia?
None of these videos show ukranian army fighting russian army its very fishy, I dont buy it
Why has no one bombed the’ //// out of the Russia tanks with drones strikes. Remove the tanks will slow invasion down. What Russia has done is so wrong I liked Russia but now they are stained like China two countries that are on my super dislike board along with North Korea  & the eu
De er skøre de russer 🇷🇺👎🤮🥸ud med Putin
This is fake Russians don't use such cars, look for the original video
Old man egos getting young men killed no matter where ur from its wrong
0:11 More lies and misleads from BBC News!!! Russian vehicles have *BIG WHITE LETTER "Z"* on boards. This armored vehicle is Ukrainian.
Ukrainian economy will be back by 50 years
That's  not a Russian tank , thats a Ukrainian army 9K35 Strela-10 Tank and has been confirmed by many military experts. This is fake news on part of the video uploader and many of the news networks. At least some press news say in their headlines SUPPOSLY and Russsina tank , because they are smart , as for the rest of the news networks and youtube uploaders , the will be be judged by God for incdigating a war against Russia. This thing will be over in week anyway. Putin actually just sent missile attacks only to BIO weapon labs in Ukriane which were build by our own US DOD agency and as for a invasion , Putin is working along with the president of Ukriane to get rid of the money laundering mobsters who have been terrorizing their country for years and funding terrorist actions with Iran and money laundering for Hilary's Hati fund , Obuma , Biden , Pelosia's and Chuck Schumer others funds. This will be over probably over in a week and these funds will be cut off form these corrupt politicians. Don;t listen to the fake news , they are corrupt and they will end up in jail soon. God is good !!!!

HOAX!!!

Putin is the guy who saved Syria from ISIS ,I bet he knows his job. NATO and the west is scared that Ukraine and Russia may unite, they knew that in 2000 , so they created that conflict , and they are funding the corrupt ukrainian governments
Peace! Russia! Please Peace!
will i get stalker 2 now?
All of this would not have been happening if only US would have back off from pushing Ukraine into Nato. They were pushing Ukraine again n again to become part of a Nato. And, Ukraine was foolish who believed in Nato's promises. Now, that same Nato has left Ukraine alone. After Ukraine, USA started convincing & pushing Finland & Sweden to Join NATO. When they were doing this, Russia sent a clear war threat to Finland & Sweden. And Russia itself on it's behalf is right no one wants to see Nato right next to your doors. And, most of post Soviet Union European countries are part of Nato. Where ever Nato goes they create Instability, they fuel the wars and ran away. Just take Afghanistan as an example, they were there in Afghanistan for 20 years and were headache for Afghanistan and Afghanistan's Neighboring Countries. They were creating Instability in South Asia. They were creating proxies in Afghanistan to make Afghanistan & Afghanistan's Neighbors unstable. And, Ukraine President is a Jewish & Zionists and their Prime Minister is also a Jew Zionist. He came into power after a fall of Pro-Russian Government in Ukraine in 2013. And, Russia hates Israel. 2013 is the same year when Russian forces entered MiddleEast and saved Syria from Nato & Israel. By dethroning of Pro Russian government in Ukraine they said to Russia, if you'll come in our way in our MiddleEast's plans, we will become headache for you near your borders. And, Since Russia went into Syria against Israel & Nato especially against Israel because Israel wants to occupy Syria they have already occupied Golan heights of Syria. Even Trump declared Golan heights as a part of Israel during his presidency. But only problem is Russian Presence in Syria their Military bases instead of MiddleEast they wants Russia to stay engaged in Europe that's why all of this started US was pushing Ukraine to join Nato & Russian was feeling Threatened by Nato's presence near to their homeland. They Installed a Jewish Comedian & Actor as a President of Ukraine to work on their agendas. Now that clown is making emotional videos to show itself innocent and fueling the fight by announcing Martial law and pushing young male Ukrainians into a fight against Russia. Russia only wants him & his government to step down. But since he is a Zionist and every Zionist is 1000s times much more loyal to a Jewish Country he will try to make Russia weak as much as he can. Poor Ukraine is just scape goat for them. If this war became Gorilla Warfare then it won't end for a long time.
Russia may claim victory within a week of war.
Just remember,the same legacy media who lied about covid for 2 years has seamlessly switched from covid to Russia/Ukraine now..They lied then, the probability of them not covering this accurately is pretty high.👍
It is a disaster
I think its like killing their own people they both are same I guess
Am NOT buying the notion that the russian people dont know whats going on....they know they benefit.....russia must be sanction and punish and boycotted til russia is no more...putin threaten nuclear war....they means he wants to destroy the world....and yet germany italy and beligum still want to do business with putin
Many  sabotage groups active  “battle of media” at WAR
Not too long ago, in 2019, Trump was blackmailing the Ukrainian president by freezing much needed military aid ($391 million) used to protect themselves from Russia. And this wasn't the only move that Trump made to help Putin with his plan to reunited the Soviet Union. Trump also worked very hard to hurt the United States' relationship with our allies. He even threatened to pull the U.S. out of NATO --- Trump spent his entire presidency trying to weaken the territory that Putin was going to eventually invade. It is heart breaking to see Ukrainian civilians, even children having to go out on the streets to fight a much stronger Russian military. This is an act of cowardice and complete abuse of power from Putin's side and Trump helped him prepare for these attacks.

That is an SA-13 gopher SAM missile launcher mounted on an MTLB Ukraine has lots of them. So probably not Russian. Why would Russia be sending short range anti aircraft into a city?
BBC and CNN 😂😂😂😂making from hero’s traitors and from traitors hero’s watch out China you next and same crap will use ( propaganda )
That's Ukrainian Strella SAM.  Positioning for Russian air strike.  You don't send a mobile SAM into the target area by itself.  Don't you guys at BBC have military expert?  By the way, those who are shooting these videos, I hope they're not broadcasting these live.  Giving out Ukranian SAM locations.

Why won't Biden send us in? I don't understand.
It is Mr.Bayden's game
Neither of those vehicles were Russian......why lie?
I want peace like every normal man do, but where was all world when Ukraines were murdered childreen in Donbas?
WEST has only remembered the Minsk agreement only 24 hours before the Russian strategic military offensive.
The west knew Ukraine would be destroyed, but still put Ukraine into bait unenviable position.
Disputin? Diss Putin?
Razz Putin.
You crane?
Restriction of men leaving is violation of human rights
Ukraine should’ve pledged neutrality before getting blasted
Russia does not have such tanks, it's like the 80s, only Ukraine has them ........
Remember when Trump refused to have any witnesses in the 2 hr closed door meeting with Putin.           Then Google,“ Trump son-in-law met executives of sanctioned Russian bank” 28 March 2017. Russian ambassador to the US, Sergei Kislyak, developed contacts among the Trump team.    Also, “Trump son-in-law Kushner wanted 'secret communications line' to Moscow” 27 May 2017- Secret Deals.        06 Aug 2018 - Trump (Again) Admits His Son Met With Russian Lawyer To Get Dirt On Clinton    What did Trump use to pay for that info.  What info did Trump use as collateral. What did he really promise PUTIN.  Or what did PUTIN have on Trump to blackmail him with?              NOTICE that after Trump lost the elections, he shut down the Open Skies treaty, even though we had already allocated money to upgrade the aircraft to be used to carry out the 30 yr accord.  That treaty allowed US a way to do reconnaissance flights over each Russian territories.  What a coincidence!!!       There is a reason why TRUMP is cheering on PUTIN.  🤨🧐🤔               Expect TRUMP and KUSHNER to have personal investments in that Russian Oil company.  And their Off-shore accounts have ties with Russian OIL production companies and PUTIN team facilitated it.           CRITICAL to Research HARDER Trumps ties with PUTIN and that so called sanctioned Russian Bank. 🤔🤔🧐
You lied russin heaviest have on them Z sighn.. Its ukranian tank
American and NATO stop parking missiles on Eastern boarders threatened others

this is all Zelensky and USA fault.  now Germany wants to send weapons, that would be the worst mistake, those weapons have no comparisons with Rusias weapons, if Zelensky stop lying and open to discussion the war will be over by now..
this is a lie, Russian armored vehicles have white stripes on their sides, in the video - Ukrainian armored vehicles.
Where's russian Z and V marks on military vehicles ??

We are not all brainwashed in the west , we do remember the Ukrainian nazis burning 50 people in a building while committing a coup very recently ( which the bbc has conveniently forgot) it doesn’t fit their agenda)) disgusting war mongers !!!
Fk BBC
Don’t panic Aussie if you can’t take the heat
This rocket that hits a multi-storey building is not Russian! This is a BUK surface-to-air missile. It was released by the Ukrainian military, which gave a malfunction in electronics, since it has been in service since the Soviet Union for > 40 years. But the whole of Europe and America believes the media, which say what is beneficial to them, and not what is actually there.
This comedian is not a funambulist! That's why the Russians have invaded Ukraine!
So this is what it was like to watch Hitler invade Poland...
All these criminals in suits, including plastic face putin should be hanged. NATO, US & EU are impotent to help.
Why you publishing fake news?
Those 2 Vehicles you showed driving down the road - are not Tanks ! Considering your country invented Tanks, it would seem you would know a Tank from an a IFV.
I'm just impressed by the driver of the public transpo. Still out on their route during an active war.
I am from India 🇮🇳 I wish peace in worlds...stop war putin
Where is pope? His people are fighting each other.

🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺👍
Ukraine incident is no longer a matter of one country. Germany and France are still appeasement. Hitler will be devoured one by one. Each country thinks it has nothing to do with itself. In the end, it will lead to World War II.  Afghanistan, North Korea, Taiwan, if these places start like Ukraine, the entire international community will collapse, democratic and free countries are still calculating their interests and making concessions and appeasement, and there will still be three wars in the end. Can you stay out of it?  If you don't stand up to the communist forces, the whole world will be devoured.  The war must be stopped by issuing a warning to commercial enterprises, directly causing heavy losses to these interest groups, and encircling the dictatorial communist state with nuclear weapons.  And this time has to be planned in advance, just like the fight against the covid virus.
Гнилая ложь BBC.
America and Nato are the cause of modern wars. They are demons with the word "oh my God" on their lips. Poor Ukr leadership, who have been led by them, now they will send more gunpowder and bullets to turn your country back to the stone age.
This war needs to be stopped somehow https://youtu.be/ujeR_jZfJyA
My heart is breaking for the people of Ukraine. Just imagine a neighbor breaking into your house and slaughtering your children and no body comes to  help you.😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏🙏
Praying for the people of Ukraine.😭😭🙏🙏🙏
putin pls stop this isn't you 🥺
This war us unfortunately going to go on for many years. The Russian haven’t thought through of the high cost of their invasion by Ukraine guerilla warfare in their suburbs.   If I was the Ukrainian prime minister/president, I would allocate a senior military person per 150 citizens and arm each suburb with anti tank weaponry. I would plan ambush attacks and strategies to cause as much damage as possible strategically. With a goal of each citizen to take out 6-8 Russians. That’s likely the ratio they’ll need, to win this war.
Looks like guys just got lost or drunk . One tank marching on the street . Delirium of BBC.
KILL THEM NOW
You really can’t believe any media outlets at this time. Full scale ?? Don’t be stupid stop spreading misinformation. It is not yet a full scale!
Stop lying! This is not Russian equipment, this is Ukrainian military equipment.

WHERE WARS ARE WON OR LOST ! Wars are waged by older men In battle rooms in countries apart. Who call for greater firepower And troops for the combat chart.  While out among the shattered flesh The dreams of all have turned gray. So young and determined their faces were Till on the battlefield they lay.  Unable to overcome their pride The politicians cast their vote. For this or that or something else As the rage of war sounds its note.  Wherever wars are won or lost The soldiers fall like toys. Down through history it remains the same Most who die are hardly more than boys.  Like monkeys in a revolving cage Man squabbles for the peanuts of power. When will we rise above our greed And become as a beautiful flower?  Death to death, dust to dust The wrath of war is a hideous crime. It’s our beast within that still prevails As it has through the torments of time.  By Poet Tom Zart Google = Most Published Poet On The Web Tom’s 1,650 Poems Are Free To Share!

The only problem is that Russia isn't even serious in this fight. If they used even 40 to 50% of their true capabilities, ukraine would be pulverized.
People in comments are saying that was Ukrainian tanks. IF SO BBC is the KING of PROPAGANDA.
Lies, BBC is a liar. It was Ukrainian vehicle. Lol. One Russian military vehicle entered Kyiv?! Lol
Does anyone know what type of tank that is?
Putin will get whats coming to him soon
It s no russia tank omg!!!!
I will try to make a brief YouTube video today or tomorrow about the 2022 Russia-Ukraine war for the "Today with Jesimiel" Channel.  Some key points I will discuss:  (.) The USA and other countries inciting Russia towards conflict via conspiracies and hidden agendas!  (.) I sent the Russian Government letters to consider peaceful alternatives!  Russia should not have invaded.    (.) The Ukranian government asks for international help, pleads for justice, etcetera, yet, they force by law men between the ages of 18-60 to remain in Ukraine, for war defences purposes.  Why exactly are you calling Putin uncivilized/aggressor, while the Ukranian President in an uncivilized, dysfunctional, and unjust way forces men to fight a war!  What about women?  I have been a long-time advocate of women rights, but, are you telling me that the thousands of women that practice sports in Ukraine, or that join intelligence forces or work, are not more qualified to fight a war, than many over weight Ukanian men who could hardly run, or that may be a lot less intelligent than many Ukranian women?  If women want "equal rights", they need to fight alongside men, including in the front lines.  Thus, I may be compelled to defend Ukraine when I see the news, but, I, representing Heaven, or wanting to exert such higher reason ideals, will not be deceived by "any" dysfunctional governments.  (Jesimiel Millar Fernåndez)
Glory and Peace to Ukraine!

If nobody wants war, then why Ukraine wants to join in Nato?
Old footage, there is so much more now… poor reporting
Where do you get your informations from? Lol more than 3,5 thousand Russian troops have been killed by today’s morning…
Fake news! It”s Ukrainian mtlb!!!!
Media is having a field day. Putin should take Ukraine to task for being a traitor. Traitors should parish
That’s what the UK and the US did to IRAK some years back, you  remember?
Pause. Is this not what the european man been doing since the beginning of his existence here on planet earth?? Creating WAR and CHAOS?? My real question is. WHY THE SHOCK NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN?? Sure bc the acts is not against Arabs or Aboriginal beings (so called blacks) and it’s old school Vikings vs Barbarians.. just like the time of Medieval now y’all heart broken?? Know thy history. Know thy nature. Is what it is! All will come to an end soon enough anyways. CORRUPT WARS that is. POWER to the “people” ✊🏿

*not trying to force anything on ppl*  But Jesus is seriously coming back , we are in the END TIMES! We need to WAKE UP!

Obviously we didn’t just show up on earth by ourselves,  there’s a God , and it’s Jesus , believe or not. I just really want to open ppls eyes so they may repent.

Putin has alienated the whole of his people to the world, well done Putin you’ve really shot your self in the foot.  Looooser.
If I was Ukrainian I’d get 3000 troops together and go over to Russia and then you can say you’ve invaded Russia and shoot any Russian soldiers You see.   By moving women and children out to Poland Russia knows who is left is there to fight so they can blanket bomb the city’s, if the woman and children stayed the Russians would have to be more precise with there missiles and artillery.  But it’s a sad time the Ukrainians are in and you have my support. 🇬🇧
Thats a Ukrainian strela-10 stop spreading fake news.
There are NO Russian tanks in Kiev, Russians try to avoid entering cities. The main targets are military bases and ammunition depots.
1:42The fire-in-the-sky was a friendly fire when UK-rain anti-aircraft missile grounded UA plane. Debries from the skies damaged high rise building.
This is the fate of a country that trusts NATO and the United States and is militarily dependent and doomed to failure.
Find Shukhevych Avenue on the map of Kiev. Look who Shukhevych is on Wikipedia. And ask yourself why the authorities in Ukraine call the streets after the Nazis???
Ukrainian Ministry of Defence claim 3.000+ Russian soldiers dead, 80+ tanks destroyed, 20+ war planes shot down! Which, as you can understand, is sheer fake news!
In fact this so-called Russian tank is a anti-aircraft missile launcher   with bewildered Ukranian soldier behind the controls! Russian tanks always come in numbers. Ukranians always try to place tanks and missiles in densely populated areas to prevent strikes from enemy Russian forces.
🤔why did vice news, time and city news do specials on nazis in Ukraine along with many others?🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Russia!!!Please stop this bloodshed and don’t go for any casualties. we feel really grief for  Ukrainian. Please go for peace. They are your neighbors. Please be friendly and don’t be cruel.
Deeply sorry for the lost lifes and injured from the both sides. But why this happened - brother against brother. NATO and USA need to be blamed for this murder act. Open your eyes, go back in time and will understand why this is happening. After the fiasco in Korea, Iraq, Serbia, Syria -  now putting order in Ukraine... Did USA manage to fix all internal problems already and have will to fix the world problems? What a shame! Shame for USA and its politics, sorry for the blind us people living in the fog.
Stay strong Ukrainians! Give putin HELL! 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Those are not Russian vehicles
My heart goes out to children and families. I hope this war to stop  and and everything back to the normal.
I am ashamed that Europe doesn’t help Ukraine.
It's hilarious seeing American comments about what Russia is doing in a Ukraine while their country is responsible for over 1 million deaths of Iraqis alone, and it was only for oil, lol the hypocrisy.
While I feel horrible for the innocent citizens of Ukraine, I can't help but to feel that it was the only way Russia can stand up to the most evil country the world has ever known "the US of A". Ps. Of you're American please shut up because your country killed millions of innocent people in last 2 decades alone, mostly the good people of iraq.
putin the war crime Putin=Hitler

Fake news from the BBC. Why would a singular Russian vehicle be on its own in the middle of Kiev. A tad dangerous dont you think? All fake news from these so called media outlets are being recorded for later use.

The Ukraines seem really unprepared.    Why didn't they mobilize weeks ago?   Draft men and women (feminist equality) to fight?  It's time for the Europeans to lead.  Famous for weak appeasement.
Seeing a Russian tank purposely running over a car really makes me furious. Putins nazi puppets will have to live with what they are doing and will have to pay for it.

Attack Russian supply lines behind with small units like squad because soldiers can't fight without ammo, food and fuel.  Poison water and food and leave them for Russian invaders.  It worked in the past in centuries stand up against bigger enemy.  Treat all Russian prisoners as war criminals.  Give invaders hell for invading Ukraine.  If Afghanistan can defeat Russians so can Ukraine.
How is the bus driver not faced by any of this? The people of Ukraine are Strong af.
If Ukraine leader is a hero, he should surrender to stop the war

NATO made a mistake had to declare war on Ukraine and send the armies of Poland and Romania to take over Ukraine and see Putin's army if we would enter Ukraine and strike NATO and the war would end with 0 casualties
Lies from the first words, these are not Russian tanks. If you yourself cannot distinguish Russian military equipment from Ukrainian, invite experts. How to trust you for the rest?
Go Russia
NATO can help more than they are. I am like the rest of you scared Russia decides to let loose a nuclear war but as the quote suggests "There are various ways in which the Constitution seeks to prevent tyranny of the majority. One such way is through the principle of 'checks and balances', which is one of the core principles upon which the Constitution was written." But this is also about our freedom which is the same as Ukraine's and we owe it to them no matter what the consequences are to our  free speaking nations. My heart goes out to Ukrainians but also the Russian people who oppose this brutality and are also living under tyranny themselves and years of propaganda. We have also experienced similar propaganda through our own experiences being told Iraq had weapons of mass destruction as a way of invading another country. But a countries right to freedom  is a core principal that must be adhered to as the main human right of every man, woman and child.
Who wants justice for Syria, Iraq, Yugoslavia? who?who?
In the name of Jesus all the Russian ministers resign from the government

Please stop war
Ложь!!!!!!
The video at 0:17 looks staged. Watch in slo-mo or pause it often and you see cars driving around normally plus many people stood around in various positions, almost like a film set.
Stop British government helping Ukrainian Nazis kill Ukrainian people! Bo Jo you are criminal!

Where is Ukraine? No need its Russia now.
Russian Tanks and vehicles have a white Z painted on them. The APC in the video must be from the Ukraine Army, its probably just them positioning to defend the city.
USA provocates..Russia retaliates..Ukrainians suffers..USA economy is totally dependent on creating global wars and reconstructions make billions .no emotions...pure capitalist protestors business.
1:33 This is not a Russian tank. This is a Ukrainian SA-13 Gopher

Well Pavlo from Ukraine if that's what you want then tell your dickhead president to go back to stand up comedy and playing the piano with his penis on television.  Zelinski is such a 2 faced spineless little worm who together with the Bidens is the cause of all your current problems.
THAT'S UKRAINIAN "TANK" YOU NAIVE PEOPLE!!! DON'T BE FOOLS AND BELIVE IN EVERYTHING WHAT REGIME MEDIA'S WRITE!!!     RUSSIAN "TANK", ALL ALONE IN MIDDLE OF KYIV.  So stupid!  And at the and...that is not a tank!
Sin does not leave the father.   Among the countries that directly supported the US-led invasion of innocent Iraq in 2003 was Ukraine, now Russia's kicking Russia.  I am not at all disturbed by the cries of the people of Ukraine, because I grew up watching the naked wailing of old women and children in Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Myanmar.
Since the revolution in 1918, apart from Gorbachev,  i cannot think of one soviet leader that has done anything good in this world - stalin was a mass murderer, Kruschev almost caused a 3rd world war by putting missiles on Cuba, and now we have this numbskull (Putin) causing more misery and worry in the World. Has anyone ever seen a country as pointless and irrelevant to world order as Russia? Putin paints himself as saving Ukrainians from genocide. there is no evidence of that at all. it is an excuse to invade. He is a bare-faced liar. he has been protesting for weeks that the military were on the border for 'exercises'. but he knew he was going to invade all along. he is a little man trying to justify the existence of russia and himself. the sooner this maniac is removed and brought to the hague for trial, the better. he should be hung for what he is doing in ukraine
Greetings from Albania. Ukraine is fighting alone because they want to be Europe and not bolshevism. we support the Ukrainian people and their President is a very brave man. this fight is not only for Ukraine but all Europe, democracy and not communism/bolshevism. Putin is a dictator is a Killer nothing else, how he can do it,  it is unbelievable to kill civil people in this century.  the Russian soldiers in Ukraine to leave the war and not kill people but to go in their homes, in their families. All European leaders and people must stand up to stop this war. we pray for civil people and their freedom.
Feel sorry for you, we saw war in Iraq and afgan sadly innocent people will die that’s life
I did NOT see a single tank in the entire video. Only an airdefense most likely Ukranian. Can someone please help identify.
all because of America and NATO.... America and NATO is responsible for this war and the innocence people die in Ukraine......
why are they fighting for ?
The BBC is vile.  Dont trust them.   Russia is NOT the enemy.  They are removing the evil people who run Ukraine who were installed by George Soros and the "elite"
If this is a Russian tank, why doesn't it shoot at nearby houses and civilian buses? After all, in one news item you say that they are bombing civilians, and here he does nothing? if everyone is actively defending there, why is this, from your point of view, a Russian tank, no one is attacking? where are all these heroes and fine weapons? Fake, you blatantly lie to everyone, people they blatantly lie to you!
Avrupa devletleri çok korkak kuyruğunu kestirmiş it gibiler Müslümanlara gelince saldırıyorlar sivilleri dahi öldürüyorlar elinde silah olan Rusya ya gelince it gibi titriyorlar korkudan Ukrayna'da Avrupa'nın bir parçası sayılır ve ne tuhaftır ki sizinle aynı dinden biz Müslüman Türkler dahil Ukrayna'yı destekliyoruz şu da bir gerçek Avrupalılar rahata alıştılar Şehirli bisküvi çocukları gibi Oysaki Rusya köyden gelmiş hırçın çocuk bir yumrukta avrupalıları yere seriyor bu bu kadar basit ve bunu Avrupalılar bildiği için Rusya'dan korkuyor Ukrayna'ya yardım etmiyorlar rahatlığının bozulmasını istemiyor Avrupalı devletler

This could be solved in 1 minute. Let NATO leaders declare that they would not admit Ukraine into NATO.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy he has my respect, no matter what the outcome is, he strong stay with his peoples to fight Russia invaded Ukraine, he is heroes. My heart for Ukrainian peoples. I'm praying God Bless All Ukrainian peoples & Ukrainian Soldiers. Nobody help you better than you help yourself now!! Stay strong Ukrainian. God & Buddha Bless You All Ukrainian!!

No way the BBC is click baiting this situation. Y’all are sick in the head
Two generations on and another nazi occupation of the Ukraine. But they have reckoned wrong they have no popular support anywhere they have invaded.
America, Great Britain and NATO should not have given false hopes to Ukraine.! this is a revelation for everyone not to be deceived by those who make big promises.!!
Liar and war criminal Putin and his henchmen should be taken to trial. All free world should immediately expel all Russian diplomats. And Russia deserves blackout. There have been made too many compromises already, too many retreats. They seized Crimea, they took sovereign soil and Ukraine and west world fall back. They now invade openly and world fall back? Not again. The line must be drawn here. This far, no further.  Now it is straight 1939. Fascist kleptocracy in Kremlin is now attacking free world. War is already unleashed by Putler. Even the blind now can see that Kremlin government si pure evil. To hold back sanctions was foolish. To hold back is foolish. It is time to destroy Russian economy by severe sanctions and let moscow strongmen eventually choose a new less psychotic tsar.   "Let not any one pacify his conscience by the delusion that he can do no harm if he takes no part, and forms no opinion. Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing. He is not a good man who, without a protest, allows wrong to be committed in his name, and with the means which he helps to supply, because he will not trouble himself to use his mind on the subject." - John Stuart Mill, 1867  "Appeasement policy, the policy of appeasing Hitler and Mussolini, operating jointly at that time, during 1937 and 1938 by continuous concessions granted in the hope of reaching a point of saturation when the dictators would be willing to accede to international collaboration. ... It came to an end when Hitler seized Czechoslovakia on March 15, 1939, in defiance of his promises given at Munich, and Prime Minister Chamberlain, who had championed appeasement before, decided on a policy of resistance to further German aggression." – Walter Theimer (ed.), The Penguin Political Dictionary, 1939
when Ukraine inevitably is defeated there will be a bloody and protracted guerilla war sad to say!!!!
World must be help to Ukrain against this barbarians...
Only one APC?Co me on...
and yet you dont call out the us and uk about syria funny that, the uk and us have killed way more civilians in syria and iraq, why dont you say that, grow a set, and tell the truth like assange
All organizations in the world are useless, world leaders are useless, they'll create war and back off, bunch of carbages using the their people to play politics 😥
Brussels Broadcasting Company (BBC) spin ? UN a waste of money, hiding place for tyranny ?
I don't think Ukraine can hold any longer. The Russian is too powerful. It just a matter of hours before she collapse. I pray that all civilians are safe. They don't deserve this wat 🙏🏼
To all foreigners who believe that it was the Russians who started this war, I advise you to watch this video (2015 year) and generally review the entire channel. This war, or rather the genocide of Donbass residents has been going on for 8 years. If you don't take my word for it, then believe your eyes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pybRVa1oD40&ab_channel=Grishanov

Those are NOT Russian tanks. In those videos are Ukrainian army APC! Those are   Soviet Era  1970's APC that Ukraine army still operates. Russia have scrapped those back in year 2000's!   Watch closely -  ALL Russian armed machinery have a special insignia looking like " [Z] " on their hull. So quit your lying.
So much for the massive attack by Russia as said by the Left wing media, not such shock and awe as the USA attack on iraq , killing thousands of citizens and making millions homeless ,people have short memories, people don’t rely on the government issuing gas masks when the Russians launch nukes against Europe because of the left wing media stirring up panic and anti Russian rhetoric ,  they couldn’t even get face masks sorted  during COVID, what are people going to use against the atom bomb fallout, tea towels .
Stop Russian aggression against Ukraine
I think a lot of misinformation from the media is not telling the truth, Russia's lighting strike is text book. Ukraine is a young badly trained army, relying on militias and volunteers. The old Ukraine army was dismantled back in 2015/2016 due to its loyalty to the deposed former Ukraine President. It's now in Russia's hands how they want to end this. Ukraine does not have a say in its destiny now.
Get it over as soon as possible.
The Ukrainian air defense installation "Strela-10" drove through the streets of Kyiv and deliberately crushed civilian cars. All the blame was placed on Russian tanks that did not enter Kyiv. Russian troops captured airfields near Kiev. The Ukrainian authorities distributed small arms to the civilian population of Kyiv as part of the general mobilization. Now people are robbing shops and killing each other with these weapons. Then they will tell on TV that these were not marauders, but Russian reconnaissance and sabotage groups.
No war in humanlife
Kievans WANT Russian tanks to come closer, it is easier to kill them in close quarters. Faith to proud Ukrainians! Slava Ukraine!
Where  is your Rocket launcher   ??? fight Russians THE SAME WAY THAT afghan did    if  a column of Tanks  are coming  hit the first Tank  and hit the last one then stop hitting them one by one  since they will not be able to escape    but i donot see that  Uranian  fighter   to carry any  shoulder rocket launcher  you can not fight only  with a machine gun   Use Mine  so  to blow  the Russian tank
lies! that are not russian vecihles! ukrainiens killed their own peoples and that is anti aircraft SAM 13 vehicle and just stupid person would belive that russians are entering in city with vehicle so anpropriate for fighting
Ukraine should have been neutral so that it would not happen to them as president duterte of the Philippines did that all countries like american or china or russia would be our friends and reconcile, if china was always our enemy and we trusted and enlisted the help of america and allied countries its just because of the west philippine sea we are like in ukraine, and so is the beginning of the war because of military drill or exercise like russia did then on the border of ukraine and russia and russia lied that it had no intention of occupying Ukraine and also the philippines and america with a shoulder exercise that China also did not agree and they also did a military exercise that is because the threat of every country and started war, the country's leader must think what is good for the country not good for other countries, we know there is no end to the conflict because both own the land, it's ok that one country is the real owns the land since then.
How tall is Putin?
It was the same in Belgrade during the NATO bombing...sade

The crypto market continues to go bearish as a result of the Russian invasion on Ukraine. This act has triggered and endangered global economy this includes stocks, bitcoin, alts, oil, gold etc.. ill say it's out rightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait to continue incur more losses along the line, instead find a way to grow your portfolio. As a trader, I have been able to continue growing my portfolio through the help of Trent Hart which I have made about 11 BTC lately by simply using his daily signals, insights and guidance.
Suport and love Rusia from India🇮🇳 ❤🇷🇺
Now where is Usa. I think they,r  join when russian .... Finish their bomb.
All Ukraine president westerners and US r  responsible people's killed in Ukraine 3000 solders could have been living in Ukraine and people's would have not been suffering so pathetic conditions if international community leaders had made Ukraine surrender to Russians imeadetly simply they have killed so much soldiers of Ukraine what suffering their families members would have to undergo there in Ukraine and what all sufferings they have still undergo after war already prices would have gone very very high people's who have very little already would have to suffer very pathetically still women and children's how badly they r going to suffer will b very very pathetic all happened to Ukraine only because of Ukraine president and all other nations supporting him  if that  bloody foolish Ukraine president had surrender imeadetly r atlest talked to mr Putin obligingly responsible  there would have been no suffering to people's and rest of the country's who r partners with Ukraine in tradings would have smoothly going on
Prestitutes.
The noise that is coming from America and Europe over Putin's invasion of Ukraine is so deafening and he is rightly being condemned for it. I give thanks to Putin.Hopefully the next time NATO and the Americans decide to invade another country in Africa or the Middle East in the name of protecting civilians or bringing democracy to that country, the noise will be just as loud as it is now.
STOP Putin, turn off your heating. D’ont use or buy Russian gas or oil. Long live Ukrainia!!!!!!

First, there is no tankS, just one tank. And second, this tank is not russian 🤦
Coward NATO and america are responsible for this they left Ukraine alone... shame on them
That large fireball is was reported to be a downed Russian fighter Jet
Russian Putin is most afraid of the tactics of the Afghan rebels' stinger missiles and anti-tank missiles.  There may be a repeat of the abandoned armored tank escape scene 。
Atleast Ukrainians aren't suffering like Iraqis from Carpet Bombing by westerners
Where was the big white Z on that tank ?
In 1999 this nato idiots bomb my country for 78 days 13 big countries against one little Serbia 🇷🇸  And all because of kosovo so that they can control drug and dirty business with albanians and now they calling RUSSIA 🇷🇺 aggressor  nato is biggest AGGRESOR  I feel sorry for innocent people losing life and it will happen for sure only sad thing this politicians will not die coz they are hiding behind walls or whatever  SAD THING IS THEY WRITE ON BOMBS HAPPY EASTER if and of you think nato is peace maker belive me they are anything but peace makers
nasanba Kasi ang nato kahit dipanila kasapi Yan .puro gusto nila maging kasapi sa grupo nila ang Ukraine dapit tinulongn na nila dapat full surpot na sila
This don't surprise me. Russians love war, the Soviet Union was all about war
THE FACT THAT PUTIN CENSORS ALL RUSSIAN MEDIA IS A DAMNING ADMISSION OF A CRIMINAL ACTION
Make no mistake this is a power/land grab by a fever sick DICTATOR
PUTIN IS THE BEST SALESMAN FOR NATO
God speed Ukraine!
That Russian armored vehicle drove across the grass!!!
And governments are allowing this to happen.  Vlad needs to go.
i curse putin is family and his supporters. may they all be murdered
Fuck Russia!!!
It's a 9K35 strela-10 short range air missile vehicle, not tank. Are you sure Russ sent a air missile vehicle to the front line Kyiv?
We offer this powerful prayer of protection. Everyone, please pray this prayer especially for the innocent people, parents, and children of Ukraine.  https://youtu.be/wNgY1GcYS7Y
Small and Powerless countries should maintain neutrality, shouldn't align with big powers. Then Iraq and now Ukraine are in the similar position. As a citizen of third world country, I have condemned US invasion in Iraq and now condemn Russian invasion in Ukraine. But, fact is that US and UK have already lost their moral ground to condemn Russia because of their illogical and unprovoked invasion in Iraq, Syria and Yemen directly or through their allies.

Because of USA
as fast as Americans invaded Iraq
C'mon get off ur high horses and start pressuring ur govt to do something meaningful. Have you forgoten how Hitler started?  Can you imagine what Putin will tell the Ukrainians after takin it over..!! This is what.. "You believed in the western countries and they abandoned you.. left you for the dead... " And that's how he will recruit to multiply his army. Ukraine is a an Army population.. almost everyone knows how to perfectly fire a Kalashnikov.  You don't want them on Russian side. Ukraine needs help now.. stop all this and start airing how little your county is doing to help
I hope GOD will strike down with huge wrath and wipe out human race , I pray for the 4000 feet wide meteor to aim straight onto earth and decimate it into oblivion
When you arm your citizens, you just put all citizens at risk.
In 80 years this will be a historical peace of history and I am amazed that I’m watching a peace of history
Stop war Russia don't kill innocent people of Ukraine
Putin strong guys in world 🌎 💪 Russia 🇷🇺 superpowers if any body have problems Russia waiting for you chk ur power 🔋 👏 😉
I didn't see any tanks.
This looks fake
U.S ,U.K ,Australia, poland  invaded and killed 2.1 million Iraqis and hanged their leader Saddam Hussein  where were you?
My opinion: The US has been trying to possibly get NATO and US nukes closer to Russia to control Russia over the years, and now the US has been pushing for the ability to have nukes to close to Russia recently and that has left Russia with no choice, - But to strike Ukraine currently, as to get US possible future nukes backed away from Russia at this time, as it was backing away in the past as in trying to retain the peace in the world. And at this time, what is happening in Ukraine: - It is the same issue as the Cuba missile crises was back around 1961AD toward the US. And if we load up NATO too much too quickly at this time of 2022AD, we might end up in a nuclear war with no winners. - 2 25 2022AD RDW -Here is something else: - Putin: How Would America React If Russian Missiles Were Placed At The Border With Canada & Mexico!? - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2Cugn8JZfk - -
I hope Biden sent Ukrain's president one of our ufo fighters to defend his capitol with!
Helmets and weapons are left strewn all over the battle field as the Rusians advance to capture Kiev. It's not the same to talk crap from afar  than to have crap dripping from behind. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is doomed and the sooner he is captured the sooner peace will be restored in Ukrain. FSLN The international press cannot resist the temptation to transmit propaganda even as the world see the truth from plain sight. Soon those warmonger liers will stage children suffering from poisonous gas attacks and babies being picked up from the side of hospitals, some of them still in incubators. FSLN Los rusos han vivido en austeridad por muchos siglos y las sanciones que ahora afectan la economia de su pais no son motivo de panico para ninguno de ellos. FSLN Putin esta a punto de tomarse Kiev para apresar y encarcelar a los titeres de Washington. Magnifico! Vladimir Putin tiene los guevos mas grandes del mundo. Ahora los criminales de Washington dicen no poder meter las manos al fuego para salvar a sus proxis. Putin no es Saddan, no es Gaddafi ni es al- Assad.

putin is killing us because we are Ukrainians. We want to have the right to our language and history. Stop nazism іn the 21st century! World, please, help us to save Ukraine! 😢
Stop war
God bless the people of Ukraine.
Root of problems is Nato. Learn from reality  Touch the bear red line. War is what you got. If you not learn that, more tragic will come this world become radioactive ash. So please use your 100% diplomatic negotiation to prevent war. *Sanctions* *Hard rhetoric* *Moron politician* *Or hypocrite statement of nato(iraq, libya, Yugoslavia)their country become western NATO victim* *Just not gonna help to make peace*
If this comment gets 10 likes I’ll brush my teeth tonight
Remember Syrian
What tank is that?
If this keeps going I’m going to have to get involved
Russia has bo guts to face Nato so they're doing this ego wars and kills the innocent civilians there🤬
The only one who benefit most from this war is UK, follow by the US and others. From sales of oil to LNG, to funds and investment in Russia, to purchases previously from Russia. Now all direct to UK and US .
Don't ask for sympathy..You all said nothing and chose not to report when Israel killed over 500 children with illegal bombing. You CHOSE to turn a blind eye to Israel war crimes and hid the videos of Palestinian parents pulling little children's bodies from the rubble..You biased and corrupt media channels are disgusting and sick!
these are not tanks
Sure those tanks are entering the capital of Ukraine.
America and NATO only watching it
They need to use IEDs
If Belarus is joining Russia why won't another country join Ukraine? The world is leaving Ukraine hanging in the wind, it's disgusting. Countries like Italy and Belgium are holding back sanctions because they don't want to sacrifice their luxuries. The U.S. has the weakest president in our history. We can at least send arms through NATO borders to Ukraine. We and NATO got them into this mess and now they're being cowards. Zelenskyy is a true leader the world needs more of.
How much lies have you fabricated so far?
Why don't all the government officials meet in a big field and have it out with one another?. Leave the citizens out of it.
None of their reporters were wearing masks whether underground tunnels subways or anywhere same for cnn nbc.
That is a Ukranian tank, definetly.
Putins the devils choice..
Imagine Russian was invading a Muslim country. The comments would be totally different. Hypocrisy to no end.
Hope Russian army is smart enough to retreat
Uk and America giving lectures. What about Iraq?
God bless Ukraine
They didn't show the part of that highway Tank video where he ran over a car driving infront of them.
to remind the whole story: when Gorbachev was dissolving the Warsaw Pact, NATO promised not to expand to the East. Once the Warsaw pact was dissolved, NATO immediately accepted Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland and other neighbouring with Russia countries to NATO. In December 2021 Putin last time requested NATO to give guarantees that Ukraine will not become its member. NATO replied that it was not Russia's business. It left no choice for Russia but to take actions to demilitarise Ukraine. It mirrors the Caribbean crisis of early 60's when the USSR was about to put its missiles in Cuba. USA was in panic, and the world was on the brim of World War.  Suppose, Russia would decide to put its missiles in Mexico - what would the Western narrative be?!

Why no one is mentioning that this war started because of the US and NATO
FREE HAWAII !!!
FREE HAWAII from the ugly evil greedy imperial warmongering dictator Uncle Sam`s illegal brutal invasion and occupation.
fuck Russia they have never done any good for the world except help stop Hitler. other than that theyve cause more harm to the world and it own people than any other country except maybe North Korea (regarding its own people). they need to be stopped they cannot be trusted. communist dogs.
Real shame the Ukrainian government didn't allow and encourage the arming of their own civilian populace at large to fight this evil invader. But subjects are not to be armed until it's too late, ie, in defense of the state.
This is an Ukranian airdefense armored blocking civilians to flee the city
leaving your own country? so much different with Israel, they joined their new born country and went to the battle strightly after they stood on their homeland.

Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
See, guys, this is the hypocrisy of the west laid bare. Check out this scenario, Imagine Russia, China, Belarus, Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea, Iran etc., forming an alliance similar to NATO. Then they decided to put troops and anti-aircraft systems in Cuba and Venezuela for example, do you think the US will ever allow that? Not a chance in hell, this will never happen. They will be invaded and their Govt replaced. Yet, we are asking Russia to accept such, Ukraine joining Nato means Nato is literally a few kilometers away from Russia's border. That's not happening. Ukraine President now offering neutrality was the move he should have made, and those lives lost and destruction wouldn't have happened. Nato claimed to be only for self defense of member states, yet same Nato was used to destroy Libya. The west talk about sovereignty and international laws, yet we attacked Iraq without justification and responsible for the death over 200k Iraqis. We've wiped out numerous families in Iraq and Afghanistan off the face of the earth by so called accidents. We currently occupy part of Syrian territory without the consent of their Govt. We have zero moral authority here. Israel launch attacks on her neighbors as they see fit. Aren't these not against international laws? Or that only applies when we chose to apply it? Bunch of hypocrites. I wish this war didn't happen, but Ukraine's President was naïve to think anyone is coming to his aid. Negotiate for peace, stay neutral and that should do it. Every big country bully others, nothing new here.
鼻子不通气啊
Ukraine's capital, Kiev, is surrounded by Russian troops. Tonight the United Nations should immediately send troops to bomb the Russian army and kill the invading Russian army.
The Russians did not attack civilians. The Ukrainians shot down a plane over a populated area, endangering people's lives. We need a new government that guarantees the rights of minorities.
Democratic Politician Vladimir Putin has committed "War Crime." Once he is eventually captured, he will be tried as a "War Criminal" according to the Geneva Convention.
Pray to God for us Ukrainians, pray for Ukraine.  We will win!  Glory to Ukraine!  Glory to the heroes!  Death to the enemies!
Всё пиздеж
Lair
It's time to accept reality, people. Putin becomes a monster, because he can. Weak NATO leadership has been pushing for memberships closer to the Russian borders, but is unable to substantiate their desire with military strength to counter Putin.
Push hard Russia victory is in sight
Democratic Politician Vladimir Putin has committed "Abuse of Power" as the President executive of Democratic Federation of Russia.
Russia is being very gentle with Ukraine, Compare to what the United States did to Iraq, Syria, Lybia, Vietnam, Yugoslavia... Keep it up Russia! 90 % of the world is with you🗽
Russia sucks
Russia banned fromm all Olympic games to anything....
strela 10 or sa-13 Ukrainian vehicle! whiteout the Z mark! BBC rat
F**k you Vladimir Putin. This makes me feel so much rage and sadness for all the innocent people dying.
Ukrainian citizens are what we should all aspire to be. I just wish the rest of the free world had the balls Ukrainians have. Fuck Putin, save Ukraine, free Russia.
Fuck Biden fuck Russia
Russia needs to pay in blood. Russia this is an American speaking. If you had a Ukrainian pilot get an ace what will happen when you face an American with a F22 Raptor. Our planes can and will darken the skies of Russia. Our navy has more planes than you do
Fuck russia

Can somebody help Joe Biden hes got his lips stuck on Vladimir Putin's zipper
Russians were not in capital at this time
PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN YOU ARE A COWARD
And this is why Americans should be able to own rocket launchers, grenades, machines guns, and any other weapons. THIS IS WHY YOU DEMOCRATS
The Ukrainian army lasted two days. They cant even defend their capital. A two day war! What a farce. No wonder their President is a comedian. The Odessa front has collapsed. Thus is a walkover.
don't worry us ontarians will take in 20,000 refugees and give them jobs and free houses thanks to fuckface trudeau
Imagínate vivir en europa y perderte de los memes que hacen de la guerra, te quiero Latinoamérica, ahora los países que nos pusieron en guerras internas en la guerra fría, ahora ellos estan en guerra
God bless Putin
Shame on Ukraine president he shut give up now and safe people life instead to give out weapons to civilians shame on him he using civilian for war  he can’t win any way. Shame on Ukrainian army who using women kids and old people as human shield . If they want to fight they should protect the city of Kiev on the border not inside the city!!!

Stand up american where is our human right. that we be fighting for, Russia already broken the human right, why you still waiting? civilian already died!
Problem is not Russian army , problem is Ukrainian government: 18000 machine guns was giving to civilians , to anyone who wants it ,just simply on the streets , with the pretext of defense Ukraine. Who and how this weapon will use no one care.  Placing rocket launchers and artillery exactly in the city between civilian’s buildings. Russia ask for talk, President of Ukraine was agreed , but then starts to set back , take a pause ,during which Nazi reconcile to cities and as, I said  before  , rocket launchers. Now they are under cover of civilians and Russia can’t attack them. Nice move , exactly like terrorists in Syria.
Here is another demonstration of how the united nation and the rest of the world only enter a country when there is gold, oil or any other resources that they can take out. my prayers for all the children and the elderly and also all the innocent people who are going to die because of the irresponsibility of corrupt governments
omg awesome BBC i rate this channel for a few years ago BBC did a prank about this very same thing happening now amazing wow
Tired of this fake news . One russian  tank moved in  and drives around the city where is most Ukrainian military 🤣 I bet that is Ukrainian tank .
We don’t know who’s vehicle is that We can’t trust MSM
Europeans suddenly recognize the value of the US 2nd constitutional amendment.
You would have thought they had better defensive positions protecting the capital?
The West caused this war by encouraging Ukraine to interlope in a hopeless relationship.  Don't f* with your neighbor's wife if you aren't willing to back her up when the husband finds out.

Let the world forever remember that on the eve of World War III that China's Emperor Xi stood with Putin.
Let's all thank limp wristed outlets like the BBC for this outcome.
Putin knows there is a lot of support for Russia in Slavic nations. Might as well make them part of Russia.
So Scotland secedes. Then Russia backs them, sells them a missile base on Skye. Then the UK invades Scotland...what about that...? ROFLMAO! Everybody is Bats**t.
Everybody says want peace... but Ukraine wants to belong to NATO... this is no peace sign.
what
BBC news is bullshit news don't believe them.
I’m surprised how the Russians are just charging in with no infantry support, those old Soviet apartments would be great for ambushes.
By what logic the Ukrainian “democracy” ended up with a TV clown as a leader to deal with Putin? Didn’t the Ukrainians notice what country exists next to them, and the same Putin who is in that country for over 20 years?  It appears Ukrainians watch too much TV.
This is It Ukrain tank arrow 10
Plan mines on the road
BBC can never report the Truth? these armored vehicles are Ukrainian, Russian vehicles have a big! Z on them. be careful where you get your news from viewers
They called Russia bluff on the "red lines "and Putin proved them wrong.
This is real loss of Freedom, real Tyramny, real violence cor all those carelessly using those words to describe free vaccines, free masks, free healthcare. Take note each one of you that have embarressed your fellow citizens with such blatant willful enforcing of ignorance wasting natural resourcea and our politicians time when Ukrajne has needed our help worldwide.
Guys it’s ok!!!! I sent thought and/or prayers. UKRAINE IS SAVED!!!
Move the capital to abother city.
If ww3 actually happen no one win we all die
I don't understand why Russia is moving into the rest of Ukraine although any war there or anywhere is evil and not needed, what I do not understand is why are other countries going in but doing nothing, they say supporting NATO but I am lost, someone please explain and this has to stop. who in the past have Ukraine ever hurt, really, like no one, they don't deserve this. just so sad. WOther European countries had better open their doors to all that need to get in, passport or no passport, these are humans and not a threat.
That armor vehicle is very impressive to drive in a city. If I had a vehicle like this I would never get stuck in traffic or snow.
This the beginning of the end of the little shrimpkin Putin.His fate will be the same as Saddam's.., strange fruit hangin from the poplar trees.
biden started this war trying to "wag the dog" another bill clinton
Wow ! I c ukranian anti air system on streets ! This is not a russian tank ! Why you lie ? If you dont know where is russian and where is ukranian vehicle - stop do news
we will win, I have no daubt about that. it is fighting nation; death will come from every place. shame on superpowers of the wourld standing by and whating. Russian Ship, fuck off.
In short, the leaders of evey country on earth work together 100% within this conglomerate!! This includes Russia, U.S., Ukraine, China, and every country/corporation that joins in this!  The number one goal of these so called military actions, is to instill constant fear into every person on earth! The leaders will all be laughing it up,   as their slaves do all of their dirty work! Order your so called congressman to STOP, or they're FIRED!
this is what usa and Uk the devils , bring to ukrainia  and they leave her alone ,
Why don’t they destroy the tank by roket or denamit
Weird how all western news channels are calling this a Russian tank when it is Russian made but is run by the Ukrainian army and misrepresenting so many facts in this conflict...
Russian tanks in Kyiv??? What happened to the thousands of "Javelins" we gave to the Ukrainians - did they sell them to ISIS already?
Where the fuck is the USA? Biden's a JOKE.
fake news BBC trash UK has more blood on it's hands that most Time to stop believing the warmongering imperialists.

Ukrainians are showing love and respect for their country, they may be outgunned, but history has shown big armies can't fight with harts, love, compassion and dignity. Ukrainian fight with hart and desire for freedom, and that makes them more fearless and strong as soldier. Stay strong Ukraine
Nato should offer the Russian troops and its people an opportunity to overthrow Putin and its oligarchs with the reward of receiving all of the Russia's wealth and oil to be returned to its people where it rightfully belongs.
Rusya tarih boyunca Osmanlı Hilafeti ile savaşmıştır.  Çarlık döneminde Rusya, Türkistan ve Kafkasya'da, Kırım'da ve Balkanlar'da işgalciydi.  Rusya, Ermenileri, Sırpları, Rumları ve Bulgarları Osmanlılara karşı kışkırttı. Ve bu azınlıkların isyanı ve ihaneti devletin çöküşünde büyük rol oynadı.  Bu azınlıklarla birlikte Rusya, Osmanlı İmparatorluğu'na saldırdı ve binlerce Müslüman'ı öldürdü.  Sovyetler Birliği Rusyası, Türkistan ve Kafkasya, Kırım ve Tataristan Müslümanlarını ateist yapmak istedi ve binlerce Müslümanı öldürdü.  Rusya Afganistan ve Çeçenistan'ı işgal etti. Binlerce Müslümanı katletti. Kadınlara tecavüz ettiler. Çocukları öldürdüler.  Rusya'nın desteğiyle Sırplar, Bosna ve Kosova'da Müslümanlara tecavüz edip katlettiler.  Rusya, Çin, Amerika ve Avrupa'nın desteğiyle Şiiler, Suriye ve Irak'ta Sünni Müslümanları katletti. İran, Rusya ve Çin'den güç alıyor.  Rusya, Amerika, Avrupa, Çin.. Dört büyük şeytandan biri Rusya!  Kısacası mazlum Ukrayna halkları için üzülüyor ve Rusya devletini lanetliyoruz.   http://www.ayncalut.com/somurgeci-rusya/?amp  ......  Russia has fought the Ottomans Caliphate throughout history.  During the Tsarist period, Russia was an invader in Turkestan and the Caucasus, in the Crimea and in the Balkans.  Russia provoked Armenians, Serbs, Greeks, and Bulgarians against the Ottomans. And the rebellion and betrayal of these minorities played a big role in the collapse of the state.  Along with these minorities, Russia attacked the Ottoman Empire and killed thousands of Muslims.  Soviet Union Russia wanted to make Muslims of Turkestan and Caucasus, Crimea and Tatarstan atheist and killed thousands of Muslims.  Russia invaded Afghanistan and Chechnya. He killed thousands of Muslims. They raped women. They killed the children.  With the support of Russia, the Serbs raped and massacred Muslims in Bosnia and Kosovo.  With the support of Russia, China, America and Europe, Shiites massacred Sunni Muslims in Syria and Iraq. Iran gets power from Russia and China.  Russia, America, Europe, China..

Tanks for everything, and GoodDie.  See you at Tiannamen Square, tank boy.
Countries need to go in there and stop Russia!
Childish propaganda 🤦🏻
We need a new rule of war that whoever the politicians are that start it must actively fight among the soldiers.
Time for Nato to declare a no-fly zone over Ukraine.  Russian air force no match for the fighter planes of NATO. Do it now or do it when Putin tries to take Poland or one of the Baltic States.
Putin's nuclear threats and acts of terrorism in Ukraine and UK using both conventional methods and Novichok are more than enough to justify UN and NATO intervening to prevent the overthrow of elected government in Ukraine or anywhere else. We don't need him to defeat Ukraine and continue his attack on democracy- he should be challenged now, immediately, not in Ukraine but in Russia, on Russian soil. HE should have remembered not to challenge nuclear armed countries. He has enslaved and terrorized his own country and his first step across his border should have been challenged. He has only been emboldened by the ridiculous shortsighted fear of an impotent toxic fossil of a backwards country.
My heart and prayers goes out to these people this could end up in world war III the whole world it could end up that way I hope and pray the Lord it don't happen,, put your hearts in with God
BBC reporters. Kkkk unhuman like they want people to die, regardless Russian or American or Iraq or Pakistan I just don't want dead people.  "Russian claims they killed some Ukrainian but it's very important to mention thAt we know 400 Russians have died ...
IF YOU TOLERATE THIS THEN YOUR CHILDREN WILL BE NEXT
If you're in Ukraine and need to seek asylum, Poland has opened it's borders and suspended their visa requirements. You can enter with just a passport, or by speaking to the right people at the border control points. They're promising safe lodging and a meal to anyone coming out of Ukraine who needs it. Check the Polish government's official website for more information. <htps://ua.gov.pl> https://www.gov.pl/web/udsc/ukraina  Information in Ukrainian https://www.gov.pl/web/udsc/ukraina---ua  Information in Russian https://www.gov.pl/web/udsc/ukraina-ru  Information in Polish https://www.gov.pl/web/udsc/ukraina2  Information in English https://www.gov.pl/web/udsc/ukraina-en
Is that a 1 sibgle enemy tank without any troops backup?  Is this normal in warfare?
Get in the game NATO! Help our friends!
This is just horrible. But Russia would care more for Ukraine than the United States Russia and Ukraine are like bothers. I'm pretty sure when the Soviet Union collapsed they said NATO will not be in former states of the USSR so like that's bad for Russia. And Russia once asked to be in NATO but they said no Soo I don't get it ae they just demonizing Russia. So why does NATO exist? I mean what would America do if Russia took over Canada or mexico? This is pretty one-sided to me
Russian smoothbrains, easily fooled people acting as sheep for their master.
And the United States is still buying oil from Russia.
Till 1990: NATO had 16 members  Russia: Don't expand further  America: Okay we will not expand (verbally, not written)  1999: Poland, Hungary and Czech republic joined NATO  Russia: But you said you won't expand!  America: Where is the written document, so jack off  2004: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia joined NATO  Russia: But you said you won't expand!  America: Where is the written document, so jack off  2009: Albania and Croatia joined NATO  Russia: But you said you won't expand  America: Where is the written document, so jack off  2017: Montenegro and North Macedonia joined NATO  Russia: But you said you won't expand!  America: Where is the written document, so jack off  2021: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia and Ukraine will join  Russia: Enough is enough, you are betraying us ever since 1990s, if we allow you, you will deploy missiles on our borders.  World: Russia is so aggressive, they are e l, they don't think about humanity, Russia is expanding. Putin is being unreasonable......  Hypocrite world!!!!!
All the latest battlefield videos here, God bless Ukraine
This is crazy!!!!  The Ukraine was doing very well.  Putin needs to be stopped..  The world should have immediately stood up..
REMEMBER, NO RUSSIAN.
It has begun we’re in the end game
Cold war never ended only morphed.
The grass! ~ The city already has very little greenery and spring is coming to Ukraine. Does Putin mean to ruin lives?
Where is the world ? Why are we so afraid of Russia ? It's time to take down Russia and China .
this is all Americans & Europe faults!! you knew that if you kept meddling in Ukraine's government eventually Russia wont take it any more and will invade Ukraine! you knew that but you did it any ways so all these shared blood of this ware caused because of you !!
This video is reminiscent of an Alien Invasion where normal peaceful life has been halted until further notice.
China and Taiwan may be next.
Ukraine's government is guilty for their people‼‼ Russia agreed ukraine's independence even ukraine was a part of CCCP. But Ukraine government leaders have corrupted too heavily with american democrats and chinese communist party and eu's some country leaders. Ukraine's army attacked to Russian land Luhanski first and the most of top politicians of ukraine left their country. WHAT A FUCK IT IS⁉⁉⁉ The most of american televisions are fake and washing their people's brain. american democrats are scared of losing their investments in Ukraine and lie to their people too. unfortunately, american democrat presidents Biden, Obama, Bush, Clinton etc ruined afghanistan, palestian, syria, libya, iraq and killed millions of millions of innocent children and people. Now these countries people are living in refugee camps starving and selling their little girls to survive. OPEN YOU EYES AND LEARN THE WORLD PEOPLE‼‼
Huhu
I support Russia
death to the communist dictator...stay strong Ukrain
🧖🙏🏿🙏🙏🏻😊 Please stop war and fighting for little kids and honest people... We must avoid and hate the war and fighting for any purpose and changes it grows violence and many more social crisis... We all want peace and silence to face the challenges and obstacles,it brings positive social changes and evolution... Revolutionair must follow the directions of peace and quiet for facing the challenges and problems. All get remed😊 Peace and silence is must powerful and greater zone to  kill the big obstacles and challenges 🌚
This is an unprovoked act of war, plain and simple. Putin used to be head of KGB and cares little about murdering and pillaging. The world needs to stand against Russia and protect Ukraine from invaders.
Srsly remove this video as the UN president used this and it was detailed as UKR vehicle 9 hours ago! Shame on you BBC
Won't be a complete cake walk, CIA has been training Ukraine troops since 2015.
Ukrainians all need to be protesting in the streets blocking tanks.  Would Soldiers really kill women and children?  Live on TV or a recording.   Nah!!
BBC still doesn’t know what a tank is, media sensationalism at it’s best.
Yet the world watches and does nothing to stop Putin. Just wait to see what China will do next.
Everybody in the world join Nato.
Russian politicians have lost what little credibility they ever had. When they speak we all know it is propaganda and blatant lies. Their efforts to blame NATO and Ukraine are completely futile as everyone knows Russia is the aggressor. This illegal invasion has proven that what many have said for decades -- Russia cannot be trusted.
Из за американской политики столкнулись Украина и Россия. Держитесь подальше со своей политикой. Люблю и Украину и Россию
Second War was over long time. The world nothing change.
Wolverines!!!!
NATO CAUSED THIS, BY LYING TO RUSSIA AND EXPANDING FURTHER AND FURTHER EASTWARDS TOWARDS RUSSIAN BORDERS,  PEOPLE SEE THROUGH THE FAKE 1 SIDED NEWS, LIKE TRUMP SAID FAKE NEWS, WAS SYRIA IRAQ AND LYBIA NOT SOVEREIGN?  HOW MANY UN LAWS WERE BROKEN THEN, I HOPE THE UK DOESN'T STICK IT'S NOSE IN WHERE IT DOESN'T BELONG, BECAUSE WE SUFFER.

No o n z no v.. so its clearly russian.. just bbc logic
Where were EU and UK in the last 8 years of murder and manslaughter in Dombass and Lugansk?! NAZIs will be sent to justice next week... it will be over. Putin with this necessary upheaval prevented the already third attempt of USA to initiate Thrid World war. By the end of this year the $US will plunge down to hyper-inflation. Then USA will fall apart into separate zones. Civil wars will tear off the states. Novus Ordo Seclorum is over! It never succeeded and will not succeed.
They are committing war crimes but no one will be punished. They will just be taxed or fined
US tanks filmed entering Baghdad the capital of Iraq. British troops seen fighting in Iraq ...

NATO is fucked up trying to pull Ukraine to join them but when Ukraine is under attack they left him No Action Talk Only
They say tanks yet no tanks shown. Then they say a missile, and show a flare. Great news channel 🙄

*Putin is a War Criminal*  This attack was unprovoked.  Putin will pay dearly for this...😈
Russian tanks moving through the city along with a passenger bus and cars.  Let me guess they were full of soldiers.

russian tank entering alone? is that possible

I think third world war is going to happen and might be the end of humanity
War is for the weak, peace is for the brave. It takes brave heros to prevent wars and weak cowards to start wars.
Questo tank e ukraino non russo , i russi hanno z bianca ….male informazione
That was an Ukrainian “tank”...
USA,Canada and european  countries are not helping Ukrain. the all countries are just barking against Russia instead of helping Ukrain. shame on USA and European countries. After creating trouble between two nations now they are playing Human rights play card. If USA and European countries want to fight Russia then fight with them straight away. They are using Ukrain. Ukrain have to understand USA and european countries policy.
Helicopters fly over houses and smoke from a fire is visible on the horizon. And it seems that helicopters are bombing the village. But it does not burn at all in the village. But this is not important, you should be shown what you need to see and know.
Why?
End the war right now if not ,war will end you
I'm proud of the Ukrainians for putting up a fight. I hope they win the war.
The helicopters are Russian, but they are not launching missiles, but traps from stingers so that they are not shot down from the bushes. But they tell you that it is missiles that are flying, of course.
No Russians tank,
No, are you kidding? This is not the Kiev metro at all.
It’s kinda like when the US invaded Iraq! Causing death and destruction based on lies and fictitious reasons!
This is not a Russian tank! Don't you see yourself?
Things like this only happen because the people let it happen. There are about 44 million people in Ukraine. Putin sent less than 200,000 of his troops there. No civilians picked up arms and fought back. They just ran away. There is strength in numbers. If Putin's mission was to eliminate Ukrainian citizens, then there would be mass casualties already. That isn't a part of his objective. The people of that country should have stood their ground and drove out his army. Sure, there would have been casualties, but all wars have them. If a person doesn't fight for their home, then they don't deserve to live in it. 🤷🏾‍♂️
BBC News is the only news media reporting Russian entered Kyiv, less alone tanks. As many pointed out in the comments these are Ukrainian tanks. Very suspicious, but I am not surprised. BBC news now have reporters reporting events all over the world - working from the comforts of their own homes in UK using the cloudsourced "news" on social media as facts. 🤣
The United States and NATO must respond immediately, in order to destroy the Russian military that Russia will remember for decades to come.
0:52 "Martial law has been imposed across ukraine with men aged 18 to 60 barred from leaving the country" I wonder where are the feminists now. Equal rights huh?
ukraine forces shell dozens of children in the past and u media say nothing
Usa caused it using ukraine poppet gov doing what they want , now they are alone in this war and biden is eating ice cream and condemning
those buildings looked like that already kkkkkkkkkkkkk
My heart bleeds for these people these people are incredible they will die for there country & there  freedom the United States  looks so weak but we were told ther wood be nuclear war so people pray alot

Российские матери, ваши дети заживо горят в танках не во имя свободы а вопреки ей. Выйдите на улицы, защитите тех кто пока ещё жив.
Battlefield music plays
Only a matter of time, it seems.
What about Kosovo, everyone from the West supported Kosovo being independent from Serbia, when Kosovo was part of the republic of Serbia for many centuries? When Russia is doing the same that Albanians from Kosovo were doing, then they're the "bad guys". Serbia and Ukraine were in the same situation and yet the Western countries supported the invasion of Kosovo and they do not support the invasion of parts of the Ukraine, due to fаct that Russians cannot be more powerful then thenm. If you want to be democratic then you must be democratic to every single country on this beautiful planet, not only on the ones that you can benefit from. I hope that everyone stays safe in Ukraine and Russia!
Mr Puttin go away u damn Dictator !
When will they decide to stop this war.innocent are dying😔🥺
ВВС лжет всегда, когда выходит в эфир, и это смешно;)))
Syria seemed a training ground for this.
this is a dome war 🤪and Putin need a boo tin
Where is ukraine ?
So the so called killer virus covid 19 is now out of the headlines....I thought it was a threat to the world...looks like now they'll move on to something else to achieve they're goals
wow
How Ukrainian naciz every day for 8 years doing genocide and killing their own kids. Just cause of this territory want to be free from Ukraine. Just watch!!! Open your eyes! https://youtu.be/7IvW3pRAC-c
One of those APC’s is begging for a rocket hit.
Russia tanks & helicopter will be destroyed 1st ... hand held shoulder missiles will harm Russia advances.
God bless Ukrainian people, we stand with you from Lebanon 🇱🇧
The president of Ukraine. The biggest clown 🤡 https://youtu.be/dBNeq56-PNo
It is strange that they have just started talking about the war. Ukrainian troops have been shelling Donbass for 8 years, children were killed, houses were destroyed.
March 15, 1939 was not that long ago.
Ukraine are just getting back what they have ben doing for the last 8 year to the separatist so stop crying like little baby that your innocents and did nothing .
Blow all the Russian planes down. Scum commies
Brexit split the eastern church & rainbow western church. Now Russia will contain the destructive NATO Gog & Magog.
As you can tell the Ukrainians are terrified of the Russians as they drive their cars and the bus's goes by ......  Yea folks the normal people know that the Russians aren't going to slaughter civilians

Новости. Америки. Террористические новости.
America is losing Ukraine, but it doesn't care about Ukraine Rather, they are interested in encircling Russia
Where is the Ukrainian army ?
I wonder if that’s the same tank that ran that guy over. That’s a war crime btw
There is no one to criticize it from Russia I think because America fears Russia if it is Iraq Or Afghanistan will declare war because it is a weak country Not like Russia is a mighty military power
"War... what is it good for" 😮‍💨
May God  protect Ukraine and citizen in Jesus name
"Cry 'Havoc!', and let slip the dogs of war."
wtf is wrong with russians?
Russia VS Ukraine Perfectly balanced As all things should be
"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing." It's truly terrifying to behold the weakness of the current European and world leaders.
Ukraine is not alone, the world is watching.
Plain evil
It really tells you something when the the entirety of the world is telling Russia to stop but Russia refuses and stands alone.
People keep talking bout how war is bad as if we havent been killing countless women and childeren in the middle east for over 20 years
愿世界和平！
Where is Nato - those who pushed poor Ukrainians against Russia now left them for their own fate when the going got tough. What a shame - Nato sending nato troops to Eastern Europe to do what? Presumably watch how Russia assaults weak Ukrainians to learn how to assault weak countries the next time Nato assaults another weak Arab or African country.
Don't be naive. this is not full scale attack. Russian army pick targets because Ukraine citizens are their brothers. When they attack Germany or UK they wont choose targets, then you will see what is full scale attack. only idiot would think this is full scale attack.
Europe is so weak cmon!!! Stop put ur pants down! Make warriors stop creating snowflakes.
I thought all of the russian vehicles have a big white z on their vehicles.     So were those russians or Ukraine's ?
i wonder what happened to apple stores and expensive stores. i'd rob the whole sht up
Look, BBC, not every single armoured vehicle is a tank.
Now the U.S. and Europe should support the Syrian Freedom fighters against Russia in Syria
Why are they making Ukraine the victim?
This is honestly terrible, Hope all the Ukrainians are safe and sound.
E.U. and America should deport all russian nationals
Russian vehicles have letter Z on sides, another lie, right now
When israel army were hammered the palestine u quiet...now u saw that action be happened to u too..ukraine..pity to u ...israel invaded palestine , russia invaded  AS invaded iraq ... ukraine ..u are still believing nato AS to help u ..time to fight ..ukraine..fight for ur own dignity..
People, you are fed with one-sided information, they create the image of a monster from Russia, but this is not true. All these actions have reasons. They dont explaine it to you. If you consider Russia a crazy beast, then study the topic in detail, and not from your media(US or euro), they deliberately denigrate us, this is part of the information war.   This war has taken on an unprecedented scale after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, almost every piece of news is a lie, if not completely, then partially. They manipulate information and mislead you. I'm not asking you to believe in something else,   I'm asking you not to be fools, and not to blindly believe your news, It's full of lies.  There is no country that just like that, having nothing to do, will invade another country.  The reasons must be very important.

Do you know that shown tank, belong tp ukranian nationalist army? And they hide inside citizens districts
the western and Europe politicians  want war and get what they want. They gave them hope and left them on their own! the civilians are the one who's paying the price. May God bring peace in ukrain and the world. I'll pray until im tired so that i can see their smile once again. #nowar.
How can U.S. citizens help Ukraine right now?  We want to help but not sure how, tell us what to do.
They need supplies and reinforcements asap!  Where is NATO? Where are the freedom fighting allies?!
This just shows how good the world has it to have the US as the world's most powerful nation instead of China or Russia. Easy to take for granted the US as the most powerful nation in the world until you see the alternatives in Russia and China
No one should have to live through this…  …. No one

A question I dont think anyone has realized yet. What will putin do about the U.S. helping weaponize the Ukraine? Wouldnt that be considered interfering military wise against the Russians? Will that cause war between russia and the untied States?
Stay strong Ukraine. X
We are all sinners and we have all fell short of our sins. Our sins will cost us our souls, for the wages of sin is death. There is GREAT NEWS. Our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ died on the cross, was buried, and rose on the third day to save you from the destruction of your sins. For sins yields to death, without believing in the gospel, accepting Jesus into your hearts, building a personal and deep relationship with him, repenting and turning away from your sins, your souls will not enter into Heaven. Your souls will be casted into hell for eternity. Jesus is returning soon, but time is severly short. This world and what it has to offer is fleeting away as I type this, however the word of God stands forever. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He loves you and thought about you since the beginning of creation, and every moment that lead up to him on the crucifixion on the cross. Accept him now. God Bless you.💛

Putin is Adolf Hitler !
How do you know this is Russian Tank?!?! Why will Russian military go in City with Air missile tank??!! That don't have any sense 😳
It is sad that a dictator can bully and kill a neighboring country at will and the rest of the world stands by and watches doing absolutely nothing but talk and hold meetings...
murder putler
"Wait a month" GOD HELP THEM...America and Britain has failed the Ukrainian people...we removed their only true deterrent and now look at what's happening, our backs are turned.
So Russia sent ONE APC into the capital I don’t  buy it that was Ukrainian military
Why is no one coming to help. Cowards of the world. All full of shit would sit and watch Hitler if it was then. And puddin brain Biden better fly those refugees to USA.
Not Russia want to place military bases into Mexico and Canada for threats to USA and not Russia brake up USA economic. This is politic of USA for Russia because it target of USA - to put away geopolitic competitor. And more precisely, not America but his government. And brothers Ukrainian people for Russian people have make betrayal for russians because they was make help to USA in this. And this sadly - betrayal have place into reality but not only in melodramas! Not only one year i have speak with my Ukrainian brothers in web an have attempts him reasons and put out the flame of war in Donbass, but they dont want to hear me. A have make to this all what can i do! But if soft strength do not can to help in this target, i think coarseness strength may be help to stop this war. 8 years Russia have endured infinity shelling of Donbass there lives the same peoples as we! How much Russia may be tolerate to this crime?! This peoples 8 years have live under shellings from Ukraina. Ask they how what is!
Where are the Ukrainian military in these videos? Where are the Ukrainian planes?
Should show the video of the russian tank running over a old lady driving down the road
We see how not great USA is, they just like to attack people in caves.
*“World belongs to humanity, not this leader, that leader or that king or prince or religious leader. World belongs to humanity.”*

damn, that ukraine army tanks mam...   :))
Ukraine belongs to Russia I wish Mexico had the fire power to take back what's our California new Mexican Nevada Texas parts of Wyoming and idaho
Same thing happened to Germany in WWII, after realizing that no one will stop them in conquering their european neighbors, they decide to build a European. If we don't learn from history, history will repeated itself!
Keep struggle for peace the World.
biden is a pussy has fear inside his head where is now his power of stealt bombars air force hahahahahahahaha,,,, biden is a chicken
Let's go Brandon..!  Ukraine = Middle east war for America and allies to sell weapons!
Come on BBC: I expected better! 1) Not a Russian "Tank," but a military vehicle, and 2) Not Kyiv, but a northern suburb. I expect such  misleading statements from your prime minister, not the BBC!!!
This is not a tank!!! It's a mobile SAM (Surface-To-Air Missile) battery "Strela-10".  I highly doubt it's Russian. Besides not having the white markings, why would the Russians send a SAM battery deep inside a hostile city? A more likely explanation - this is part of Kiev's mobile air-defense system. The same that shot an unknown plane or rocket last night. Just my 2c
Funny how this leader is actually in danger, and he still stays in his capital!..... Yet  Justin Truedo fled from a bunch of people singing and dancing 😂
Again! Russia is not fighting with ukrainian people! No civilians will be hurt! It's a special operation by demilitarization of Ukraine! This operation will stop the genocide of people of Donbas!
Why 16-18 year olds tho? That’s so fucked up it should be at least 20-30 year olds leave the kids out of this.
Ukrainian "Strela 10". No sense that AA machine drives alone in hostile city, unless, Kyiv fall aready, and it's not.
Chaos
Dear Ukraine, time to start fighting or you're going to be part of the reunified USSR.
WTF's Putin's problem? Trying to flex his military?
Stay strong
I don't understand where the proper defensive weapons are that the West should have supplied to Ukraine. I mean where are the heat seeking missiles and anti-ballistic missiles to intercept the bombing of the Ukranian cities? Where are the anti-tank weapons?  Why aren't their battles keeping the Russians from advancing? What is going on? It is so sad. Ukraine relinquished its nuclear arsenal when the Soviet Union feel with the assurance from Russia and the U.S. of guaranteed security. This is just horrible.
Take over Russia do the damn thing
people all over the world - unite against putin
If only these people had some balls like the Asians and threw some molovtovs at these fucks, there not doing anything but blowing up vacant and poor housing riding through the streets making propaganda videos
Stop lie! These armored vehicles at the begining was ukrainian! Not russian! Russian army will not entering the city by one or two units alone! Turn on your brain! 4:06 - is a result of nonprofessionalism of ua forces! They shot down some aircraft right over the civilians buildings!
Britain, France, Germany and America should be fun to put people at war and then watch them die from afar.
Trust idiots to start another war.. pointless.shame on the ones taking orders in the army and not standing up..
Putin, this war is on YOU!  Innocent Ukraine people, Russian people and soldiers on both sides (who have no choice in the matter) are dying because of your ego & greed.
GrEAT JOB BIDEN!
Stay strong 🇺🇦💪
No Z painted on the tanks. Fakenews.
"Do not expect that once taking advantage of Russia's weakness, you will receive dividends forever. Russian has always come for their money. And when they come - do not rely on an agreement signed by you, you are supposed to justify. They are not worth the paper it is written. Therefore, with the Russian is to play fair, or do not play." - Otto Von Bismarck.
BBC is 🤥
Those were Ukrainian armoured vehicles and the plane that was shut down was Ukrainian, idiots thought that it was Russian.
自己选的总统 怪谁😁
Yep Ukraine is gone no one is correcting Kiev to Kyiv. Next time Ukraine spend money on defense not programs to get foreign countries to spell Kiev, Kyiv.
How come muslims can be perfectly fine from the strongest powers of the world but ukraine gets wiped in 3 days💀
Say thank you for this war to the USA who has been bullying Russia for so long.
I would urge people to check their pension and investments since this war started. I checked and they are dropping like a stone. Is this the start of a great financial crash?
Wow this is just so blatant.  You should be ashamed BBC....... you are sick!   This video clip of "Russian armor" is showing what looks to be the very same sa13 that ran over a car moments later in the video when it lost control.  In this clip you see what is likely a Bars or Kozak 4w apc Ukraine made, driving the round about.     So am I to believe that two Russian apc one for air defense the other light armored  patrol entered a hostile city on their own. Just the two. Or am I too see the russian vehicle that murdered a civilian?    That is promoted as such on the the latter part of this video?  That video has no context no info just an sa13 accidentally running into a car. That is sold as Russians murder.   War is horrific on its own it does not need the BBC to dump gas on the fire. Russia has invaded Ukraine people are being killed is that not good enough for you? You keep pushing until what? we demand we get in on the killing? That everyone must kill...god help us!
Trump Strong like ManlyMan Pootin & Talibans
I wish thr BBC covered the Iraq and Afghanistan invasion like this
I wish Russian army would STOP killing innocent lives and STOP bombing blocks full of people. Tanks intentionally are driving over civilian cars with people. Streets are full of blood and teared flash from shot people and drove over with tanks, armored vehicles. Dead Ukraine soldiers and civilians on streets. This is not war ..it's war crime. The Geneva Convention it's violated. Putin... you are a dictator ,not a president or leader. Soldiers who kill innocent civilians just because they think it's fun, are the ones who should not have the right to live.
I hope Ukraine kicks those dirty commies ass  Isn't it wild that if you don't like communism the commies call you a fascist?  Im pro freedom Fuxk pootin
The  creator  what is  the meaning of  this
China is so stupid they should atack Rusia for Syberia free resource but oblic eyes are stupid!!! Why to pay $ for gas and oil when China can invade Rusia and take for free?(Now is your time China to shine atack Rusia!!)
BBC fake news
No Russian tank.  Ukrainian tank.
So the Lav says do as Putin says or get killed? Okay.
Long live Ukraine!
You see the craziest things when you don't have a javelin
Nato aprovizionati odata aramata cu ce promiteti anti tank macar asa fac daune serioase Rusiei ce dracu tot asteptati sa nu mai aiba cine sa le foloseasca impotriva Rusilor Criminali????
Too much talk from NATO and the US without action on the ground to help. Come on move in and help Ukraine.
Are you asking about the results of Russia’s “aggression”? They are as follows: half of Europe and part of Asia got their statehood from the hands of this particular state.  Let’s remember who:  – Finland in 1802 and 1918. (Until 1802, never had its own state).  – Latvia in 1918 (before 1918 it never had its own state).  – Estonia in 1918 (before 1918 never had its own state).  – Lithuania restored statehood in 1918 also thanks to Russia.  – Poland restored the state with the help of Russia twice, in 1918 and 1944. The division of Poland between the USSR and Germany is only a short period!  – Romania was born as a result of the Russo-Turkish wars, and became sovereign at the behest of Russia in 1877-1878.  – Moldova as a state was born within the USSR.  – Bulgariawas liberated from the oppression of the Ottoman Empire and restored its independence as a result of the victory of Russian arms in the Russian-Turkish war of 1877-1878, which had its purpose. As a gratitude, the state of Bulgaria participated in two world wars as part of anti-Russian coalitions. Now Bulgaria is a member of NATO, and US bases are present on its territory. After 1945 there was not a single Russian soldier on its territory…  – Serbia as a sovereign state was born as a result of this war.  – Azerbaijan as a state took shape for the first time only in the USSR.  – Armenia was preserved physically and was reborn as a state only in the USSR.  – Georgia survived physically and was reborn as a state thanks to the Russian Empire.  – Turkmenistan never had statehood and formed it only in the USSR.  – Kyrgyzstan never had a statehood and formed it only as a part of the USSR.  – Kazakhstan never had statehood and formed it only in the USSR.  – Mongolia never had statehood and it was formed only with the help of the USSR.  – Belarus and Ukraine also for the first time gained statehood as a consequence of the Great October Revolution in the USSR republics. And only in 1991 (also from Russia) they gained their full independence.  It is also worth considering the role of Russia and the USSR in the birth and establishment of such states as China, Vietnam, the DPRK, India, Greece (repulsed from the Turks by Russia in the distant 1821), Algeria, Cuba, Israel, Angola, Mozambique, etc. .  This strange “aggression” was historically manifested by the Russians!  With the significant contribution of this country, even Switzerland has achieved independence from France. Or rather it was made thanks to Suvorov (217 years ago) and since then Switzerland has never (!) fought;  Also:  – Liberation of Austria from the Third Reich in 1945;  – The liberation of Czechoslovakia from the Third Reich in 1945;  – The position of Catherine II in 1780 with the creation of the League of Armed Neutrality and the actual support of the North American United States in the struggle for their independence from Britain.  – Twice for the last 2 centuries Russia granted independence to most European states after the destruction of Hitler and Napoleon;  – Stalin’s position in negotiations with the United States and Britain gave Germany the opportunity to preserve statehood after the defeat in 1945;  – The position of Gorbachev allowed without undue problems in 1990 to re-unite both Germany;  – USSR assistance to Egypt, after which it was able to withstand and consolidate its independence in the war with Israel, Britain and France in 1956-57.  – Intervention of the USSR in 1967 stopped the war between Israel and Egypt (actually saved the Arabs from the defeat in two wars in 1967-74).  – The decisive role of the Union ensured the conquest of Angola of its independence in 1975.  And finally, the main thing. It was the USSR after the victory in the Second World War that played a key role in ensuring that most of the colonies of Western Europe gained their independence in the process of worldwide decolonization launched by the Union.  The whole history of Russia suggests that it was consistent with any power and system in upholding the principles of independence and self-determination of nations and peoples. It is Russia who helped in every possible way to create a multipolar world in any epoch and at all times.  Unfortunately, very often at the same time, it sacrificed own interests, and if the policy of Mother Russia was at least equal to that of the British, now half the world would be part of the Russian Imperial Commonwealth of Nations, and the Russian people would bathe in luxury like sheikhs of Saudi Arabia, at the expense of states, countries and their capitals freed from other colonizers.  That’s why half the world owes Russia to the grave. And that’s why all of you are so guilty before this great country.

If theres no concrete help from NATO and US, they are not a real friends and allied..better to bow and embraced Russian annexation , its your mistake to be  friends with west than east..one thing is sure now Putin is a mad man.
Love to Ukraine. Hope this war ends asap 😥😥😥😥
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xcfJY6QwnY here is footage that shows russian military driving over civilian vehicle in armored tank... thankfully the person did survive and yes it's russian rank not ukraine, it has Z on it same as russian military are known for marking their tanks and equipment with Z
Hold on Kyiv!
Be wary of media reports. The Ukrainians use the same armoured vehicles as the Russians. Secondly, that is not a tank. Thirdly, would it be on its own? The media are not experts. Pray for the Ukraine.
I'm wondering what Putin thinks about how bad those Javelin & Stinger missiles taste right now. 10+ aircraft shot down. How humiliating for the Russians. What a weak military.
Muslims have defeated Russia twice in Afghanistan and again in Chechnya. It's true that they took it in the end, but after Russia's billions in losses and a proper president change, Putin was chosen.  And the reason is that we believe in one God and we want to testify more than life. As for you.I don't see you firing a single shot of fear.  🤔💔👏🏻
Tanks have been around since the first world war and BBC STILL hasn't figured out what a tank is. None of their footage here showed a SINGLE Russian tank. Anyone who trusts BBC at this point is not too bright themselves.
😱🙏
Why nobody stoped/ attaked them ?
Как же БиБиСи, и не соврёт. Настоящие журналисты, никогда не проверяют инфу и всегда лепят пропаганду.
Clearly Washington and the Wall street have long expected and wished it to happen. There were a lot they could do to avoid this war but they didn't. Look at yesterday's stock market.
I see another video that the same tank destroyed a civilian vehicle
The western  world will never be the same until the Putin regime is displaced - hopefully by internal dissention. This Russian aggression against a  sovereign independent state will never be overlooked in our future trade and commercial dealings with both Russia and probably also China who has not refuted the use of force to take back control of Taiwan.
They ask what the Z is for on Russian equipment? It is for Zombie. Mindless puppets of Putin. Death to all Zombies.
Ukraine ❤️🙏
this should be called olds, because of news it has nothing, the same images the same giberish
outright lies, there are no Russian troops in Kyiv, fake
Totally propaganda F.U. Remember. Iraq. Afghanistan. Libya. Syria. This is not something new
Have to wake up ! Focus on Canada and globalism ...
1:48 Ukrainian air defence shot down its own SU 27 it fell on the city.
Propaganda is alive and well with the  corporate war mongering media.
The difference in manhood between the Russia and Ukrainian Presidents is startling. One fighting and one a pussy in Moscow.
Just play russian hardbass
I honestly think Putin is dying, or has completely gone off the rails. It makes no sense! What is Russia actually gaining from it? Nothing, it’s just an ego thing. But if it were an ego flex that you could get away with… stupid, but whatever. But this thing costs Russia its economy, e.g. Germany has suspended the building of a massive gas pipe.  This is the behaviour of a man who doesn’t give a damn, someone who wants to do something explosive. His “patriotism” is very typical of what Putin’s media promotes as patriotism… that is, one that is not defined by making your country more prosperous, but by your hatred for your neighbours and your willingness to sacrifice your own people. It’s messed up.  Ukraine has done nothing wrong! Wanting to be a corruption-free democracy, as opposed to being a vassal state for Putin, is not a crime! And the West… what the hell?? How can you abandon an ally like that? What kind of message does it send to other bloodthirsty regimes, like Turkey or China?  We have known of this plan for many years. OK, Crimea has always wanted to be a part of Russia (that is, the majority of Crimea)… but no poll in the history of the Donbass and the Luhansk area before 2014 had ever shown a desire to secede from Ukraine, quite the opposite (and only an idiot would recognise the 2014 Donbass referendums, which were held at gunpoint). The terrorist groups ruling these areas now, the DNR and the LNR, are mostly made from Russian mercenaries who were sent to Ukraine to destabilise it.  There is no doubt that the people of Donbass and Luhansk wanted to protect the status of the Russian language in their area from a perceived threat. In 1994, the Donetsk and Luhansk Regions held a referendum where 90% voted in favour of making Russian an official language in Ukraine, alongside Ukrainian. The Government of Ukraine ignored these results, which, in my opinion, was a strategic mistake.  If you have a nation made up of different ethnicities, ethnicities correlating with certain geographic locations, the smartest option is to follow the Switzerland model – that is, cultural autonomy for the different parts of the country, and neutrality when it comes to regional conflicts. If Switzerland had sided with any of its neighbours in any war, it would’ve collapsed, as the German part would’ve supported Germany, the Italian part would’ve supported Italy, and the French part would’ve supported France. Neutrality is the way Switzerland remains united.  The huge mistake the Government of Ukraine made in 1994 was to ignore the will of the people in East and South Ukraine in regards to the status of the Russian language. When you have a pro-Russian East, and a pro-Western West, divided by language and allegiances, your only way to build a strong nation with an identity which appeals to all is to declare international neutrality and give the different ethnic groups cultural autonomy. Anything else just sharpens and escalates those differences.  However, despite all the discontent in East Ukraine about the perceived threat on the Russian language, Putin knew that the majority of the people there would never secede from Ukraine, so he created two terrorist groups to do the job, the DNR and LNR – and now, as expected, he has moved in to officially annex these areas to Russia.  What is worrying as much as the invasion itself is China’s support of Russia. No government causes so much harm to the world these days as commie China. China has established its importance by becoming the main slave provider to world manufacturers. It’s a bloodthirsty regime that maintains concentration camps for political dissidents and stands behind such vile regimes as North Korea and Putin’s Russia.  In order to enjoy the Chinese slave labour and market, the West has done the dumbest thing you can do – recognise commie China, as opposed to the Republic of China (Taiwan), as the “real” China in 1971 (the shameful United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758). This is one of the two major betrayals the west has committed against its allies in the East, the other one being the handing over of Hong Kong to commie China in 1997 by known war criminal Tony Blair, as opposed to allowing the people of Honk Kong to have a referendum and decide whether they wanted to be independent, join the Republic of China (Taiwan), or join commie China.  My biggest concern is that the murderous regime of commie China will use the Ukraine situation as a precedent and invade the Republic of China (Taiwan), a democratic ally of the West.  This thing is quite personal for me. I was born in Donetsk, I’m half-Russian and half Jewish. I don’t speak a word of Ukrainian, I never felt Ukrainian… and yet I can’t think of anything worse for the people of Donbass than be a part of Putin’s Russia.  I think one of the things that motivated Putin was the fact he didn’t like seeing the situation in Ukraine improve, as it has been in recent years. Finally, for the first time in its history, Ukraine has a good President – a guy who is not corrupt, a true liberal, someone who really has a vision to take Ukraine forward – Vladimir Zelensky.  My feelings towards the EU are mixed. I genuinely think it’s bad for some countries (it was bad for Britain, and I think it’s bad for France, Italy, and Greece), but I think it can be financially good for other countries (its lack of democracy is a whole separate topic) – like Poland and Ukraine. Under Zelensky, the prospect of Ukraine joining the EU has become real, and that’s what frightens Putin.  It’s not a rational fear, it’s an ego issue for Putin. Putin is like an abusive ex hating to see his former partner, Ukraine, becoming successful and finding someone good, after years of him abusing her and telling her she’s worthless without him.  What disappoints me is the fact the world did nothing to protect Ukraine. No, I don’t mean to invade Russia – just like with Vietnam and Iraq, it’s time people learn that foreign military invasions don’t normally end well. However, if NATO nations had made the effort of sending NATO soldiers to Ukraine, simply to be present there, Russia wouldn’t have dared to attack it. The West completely abandoned Ukraine, showing Russia and commie China they can pretty much get away with anything. How can the free world protect itself if tyrants get to get away with attacking and destroying democratic states?  It’s very interesting to see how the Russian internet reacts to it. Judging by the comments, most Russians are cynical about this situation and don’t see any benefit in it. The problem is, after years of being abused by sadistic dictators, Russians don’t have any concept of civic responsibility. The whole idea that a government should be accountable to its people and that the people are the ones with the power to replace a government… they don’t get it, which is a shame, as a democratic, free Russia would not only be good for the rest of the world, but it would mostly be good for the Russian people themselves.  https://imaginarygun.wordpress.com/2022/02/24/save-ukraine/
We condemn deeply... We are concerned deeply... We will... Bla bla bla... This is Biden government, NATO, UN... Ukraine never trust in West...
This is a total lie!. Those are Ukrainian tanks with Ukrainian soldiers!. Stop making up lies and just tell the truth!!!.
Profiting $32,650 every two weeks, Mr. James Williams has totally changed my life.
Immediately at first glance those are Ukrainian Strela-10 along with Varta 4x4 apc in the front..they are on their way and none had those visible Z markings consistent with Russian columns.
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇮🇷🇮🇷🇮🇷🇮🇷
Dictator Putin.
😂I'm happy with what's happening in Ukraine. I remember when they entered Iraq with America with their tanks  And today Russia enters them with their tanks. It's God's appreciation. 😉❤️ America has wreaked havoc on the countrys. I think it's time to end the American era as a nation's member.
In the former Yugoslavia, the UN has brought peacekeepers, the Blue Helmets. There is also a fratricidal conflict in Ukraine as in the former Yugoslavia. It doesn't take NATO to make peace. Russia has deployed peacekeepers in the Donbas. UN troops could also intervene to create a "no man's land", a green area where Ukrainians can be protected. Eventually they can do this around the big cities where they are civilians, so that they do not suffer because of the invading soldiers who could commit barbaric acts, rapes or massacres with lethal weapons against the defenseless.
May Allah accept what I said.
FROM TODAY I CLOSE RUSSIN GAS AT MY HOME  HOPE ALL EUROPEAN CITIZEN DO SAME
У НАС НЕТ ТАКИХ "ТАНКОВ"!!!!!!!!!! ВРЁТЕ КАК ДЫШИТЕ!
The best and perhaps only way to stop the killing in Ukraine is for Russian citizens to unify and stand up to Putin. Putin isn't as bad as Hitler but he stands just behind him as a ruthless killer.
Do you remember videos from Desert Storm? In comparison this does not look like an all out assault. More like a stand-off inside Ukrainian territory, in order to negotiate.
How can the west close their eyes to this genocide ? Who is next Germany ? This is embarrassing for the west ? Is G7 gone still include Russia !
The biggest agressor in this moment is the USA, this war is about they, like Syria, Afganistan, Irak,Lybia, and so more country
Ukraine should both leave NATO and NOT annex to Russia in any way. Then proceed to lap dance US for financial gain in secret, craftily keeping Russia calm that they won't allow enemies to be at their backyard and keeping US entertained with economic treaties. Honestly Ukraine sold themselves too cheap to NATO for too high a risk, bad business on their diplomatic team.  Some countries in South America lap dance both the US and China quite successfully, it can be done.
Hearts and Prayers to the innocent people who just want to live in peace.
I can't imagine the horror of waking up to this with children and elderly  and no where to go. Their government told them not to panic. They could not have prevented this but they should have prepared the people. My heart is so broken. If I could go fight with Ukraine I really would.. please pray
Almost 3 million people in Kyiv. WTF Putin? Lunatic, megalomaniac and murderer of innocents.
sorry, but how is possible that an alone tank is driving inside kiev and the ukrainian army dont fight against it ? i can not understand this.
Putin is a punk. Too bad Russia couldn't pick on somebody their own size. Cowards.
Since the West, Nato and US is so weak, just surrender and lay arms down.  Russian won't shoot you be at peace. I'm sad on the little children's and elderly that can't run.  Maybe it's time for a regime change and it's best to be under Russia.  At least the innocent Ukraine people won't suffer.  It's the government issue not the people especially the US is to be blame they have a history of causing revolting promise of lies to other country.
Russia fight dirty
Where is western  countries  who promised  Ukraine  for security  against  Russia.  Ooooo.... these countries  are  enjoying  this war. Because  they  love blood. Americans  had did a biggest  mistake  by electing  their president as Biden, i think  if trump is in power  at this moment  then war can't  happened.  Thax western  countries  for showing  their real face. We will never trust you.
So nazis are the kids too So fuckn stupid  Its hella messed up
Why is this happening.?where is the Ukriane army.
NOW you get a look at what 8 years of  bombing of Ukraine by the Anglo-Saxon's regime looks like .
Is this a Ukrainian tank? If so why isn't it being reported as such?
where is germany..
Очередное враньё. Кушайте "господа". Мозгов же у вас нет?))))
Trump emboldened Putin. Shame on Trump
Red Dawn
first US told Ukraine they will help them and now They are saying God Bless Ukraine   NATO = NO ACTION TALK ONLY. US and its kids Allies in NATO push Ukraine to fight one on one with Russia Stop giving false hope to innocent Ukraine.  Russian Supporter
you all hypocrites, who were you when the Americans started a war in the Middle East? where were you when the American government fed the terrorists to overthrow the government? Ukrainians = Russians Russians = Ukrainians. Do you think it is a coincidence that Russian soldiers do not hit civilians? since they are their brothers. you are 0 in history to understand that behind the comedic president who came up with a coup is America. those who are fighting now are mercenaries and Nazis !. is it a coincidence that the Ukrainians did not throw a single bullet at their brothers? of course not. love from greece Ukraine join Russia you are a family. your saint had seen all this.
Idiots. this is Ukranian old style tank going to set pisition in urbans areas to avoid air strikes from Russia, they covers their asses inside the civilian areas....
Blood is in our hands
I am from Pakistan and I am a peace lover❤️
Russian troops have already killed hundreds of Ukrainians.  👹👹👹 Putin is a devil ❢❢❢  👹👹👹
*People fleeing Ukrainian* Putin: ah yes they love me
People don’t talk about the people that are dying in Yemen
Sending Massive positive energy.
Drones, road side bombs, cruise missiles, jokr missiles-  where are they? Why aren’t they being given to and used by the Ukrainians???
Other BBC news says Russians are 20 miles from Capital , and here you say Russians are in Capital , the fk is wrong with you :D Atleast say 1 thing not both :D
That is not a Russian vechical, no white 'Z' on it.
Western intelligence was 100% accurate.
Putin is now a war criminal who can never go anywhere in the world anymore except to visit his friend the Chinese dictator....or Kim Jung Un...
I hope Russia goes down in flames to invade a city full of civilians like that in this day and age makes me wish ill on the Russians. If you were decent people you wouldn't support Putin.
Europe made assurances if the Ukraine gave up its nukes they would be protected every man woman and child that has died is on there heads
Heart goes out to all Ukranians and RUssian civilians who may die or are dead. why doesn't EU do anything?
.Not like we never seen it before. Before 1990 Russia controlled  Ukraine, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, East Germany, Poland, Romania  , Yugoslavia, Estonia, Latvia Lithuania and Afghanistan.  Tell this old KGB dinosaur that the 1980s are not coming back.
Cowards killing children civilians theay want peace putin is a coward fro Alb Nm
europ has closed his borders for his friend Ukraine
Shame Covid didn't take Putin.
Easy kick these tyrants and power freaks out.one man in each nation who are in power gone saves lives.
Fuck you kremlin fascists!
Русские вперёд
Don't worry Putin will dei soon
PUTIN = HITLER
Putin won this. He didn't even bother with civies and it looks like the civies didn't even bother defending much either. Good thing they're not Taliban else people will be starving to death.
God help the Ukrainian people.
Governments get their power/legitimacy from the peoples willingness to allow them to lead. Any government put in by putin (no pun intended) will fail in enforcing any pro russian policies on its people.
Why are innocent people dying ,innocent children  , may there be peace
Putin needs to be taken out
where the English are, there is a war..Irak,Libia,Syria,Serbia...Ukraina
Вообще оборзели!!!
Afghans rn 🤬 how it feel bi**h
I pray for Ukraine, for the innocent Russian civilians who want no part in this... They have a Psychopathic Serial Killer for a President... Not the traditional serial killer that takes out victims one at a time... He takes them out by Cities at a time....
Yeah my ass russia had more deaths. The russians are going to win period. The ukraine forces are weak.
The president of Ukraine is blaming the world for not doing anything? Didn’t he say, “stop making it bigger than it is. Stay out of it” to the US and such?
Currently not too hot on the Russians well the sympathetic ones but with all the miss information going on, that makes me believe they are targeting only military and key infrastructure; but they don't APPEAR to be intentionally harming civilians and I will give them that. Which is very nice to know in such a shit situation. (capitals on appear, bc I'm English and iv been keeping well informed but to a limit im not there and i dont know for sure! no im not counting crossfire and accidental missile debris collateral will happen in war. yes its Russia's fault but were bit past that)  Edit: nevermind https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SB1cxIc3qDA
NATO betrayed Ukraine
Where the fukk is *Team America?*
A few American AC. 130J Ghostrider gunships, and some euro fighters. Would really help the Ukraines out.
Man wonder how it feels like.... To be powerless..
Evil USA Europe Russia
Make no mistake. Even if Ukraine or Russia wins the citizens of both suffer and the leaders will go their ways the day after all this is over.
Ukraine still looks like old soviet ukraine, now Russia will occupy them no they doubt they will stay like this.
Russian tank without the Z markings.  Right.
на видео . Украинская техника
Why don't they show the tank running over a car that was driving?
Stop the f*** putin !!! Do somethink we must help Ukrain !
Let the Ukrainians thank the German Greens and other Europeans with similar energy policies, the dismantling of power plants and therefore the absolute dependence on the stalin of the XXI
The US was criticized a lot for the oil wars, no one has yet informed all those flip-flops that 90% of the gas that Russia sells to europe with lower case letters passes through Ukraine with its corresponding tolls, if they are not allowed to sell through the gas pipeline of the Baltic in the conditions that they want, what better than to control Ukraine.
ROTHCHILDS NEED THAT DIRTY ASS CURSED MONEY.  WHAT THE HELL ELSE IS NEW.  THEY GIVE PEASENTS ALL THE SHIT THEY CAN'T STOMACH.
War isn't the solutioni Please stop WAR! NO WAR! NOW WAR! NOW WAR!
WTF is wrong with people! Like we dont have enough problems on this planet. There is nothing good in war!! Why is it so hard for these hot headed people to understand !!
Free Ukraine! Stop Russian aggression! I pray for all Ukrainians! ❤️ 🇺🇦
Why only men barred from leaving the country?  Where's the gender equality?
that 1 tank was stuck on the road because it intentionally ran over a civilian vehicle almost killing the old man inside he made a turn right into the car....
Kiev*
450 Russian trips killed in one day? Jesus so at this rate in a year all the Russian troops will be dead.
I'm Serbian and it looks it will take us to unite all Slavs
My future wife is in Ukraine, I just haven't met her yet.
Where is NATO??
So if russia will manage to take over ukraine in a few days. Probably, they can invade england in a day while bojo is decorating number 10 for stag party and scotland in 5 mins while nicola sturgeon is busy creating another covid restriction 😂😂😂
Cowardly Putin, their quarrel is with NATO so why attack Ukraine? Because Putin is cowardly and wants an easy fight. He also wants a puppet state so he can rule Ukraine indirectly. Let’s see Russia fare against the entirety of Europe plus USA. They wouldn’t last a week LOL
Where is the Ukrainian army . thought they had arms.
Where are the Ukrainian army
SA-13 gopher? They will have the air locked down super fast.
If President Zelensky leaves all of this would maybe and hopefully stop . All of those innocent people dieing for nothing .
Very Bad News 😂
Besides condemning Russia for the invasion, lessons shall be learned:  1. How to deal with superpowers (Today’s consequence is a result of past decisions made by the Ukrainian government…)  2. Never trust empty promises. (Disarming yourself based on some verbal promises is not a wise decision…) 3. Select first then elect is a key when picking a country’s leader. (Popularity doesn’t equal to competency, government needs a competent leader not a popular one…) At this moment, it seems Zelensky and a number of government officials are still in the capital. You earned some respect at the end. Best luck to you and those who voluntarily stayed to defend Ukraine. 🇺🇦👍
Russian assassin's!!!!!!!
They didn't show that tank run right over a car with a person inside.
entering in London....
Greatest deception of the century by US and EU... Sorry for people of Ukraine.....
So what’s NATO and UN doing in all of this🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
West should open the doors for Ukrainian refugees.
Ukraine is a RUSSIAN territory victory to Russia death to nato and imperialism love and solidarity with Russian comrades from Chicago USA!
US & NATO only support Ukraine with lip service! Wake up poor Ukrainian! please see their true color
Afghanistan season 2
Bloody hell those vehicles are only just over 5 miles away from the Capitol building. Dear God that is way too close. If they don’t put up an absolutely massive front against the Russians here they will capture full control of the city probably within two days. For fuck‘s sake we need to do something.This is MC horrific. Hong Kong was bad enough but this is right on our doorstep. What the fuck is it going to take for us to actually bloody well do something beyond just meaningless sanctions. They aren’t going to stop bullets flying through the air.  At least during all of this the Ukrainians have truly given it an absolutely massive go.They’ve taken out so many armoured vehicles and Russian personnel as well as that large aircraft that was downed last night. Still would be interesting to know exactly what that one was. Don’t surrender Ukraine just yet. It is never worth it. WE BELIEVE IN YOU. You truly have the strength to carry on, probably more so than we do today. You hold within you the spirit we once had, all those decades ago.
I always enjoy listening to the callous 'Told you so,' speeches.  "You shouldn't have wore a dress, and you wouldn't have been raped."  "It's all your fault!" "Didn't want to pay high fuel prices, you shoulda thoughta about thata when you bough your car!" "You're poor, because you didn't work hard enough!" "You should have moved when Putin threatened you the first time!" "The cops would not have knelt on his neck if he just obeyed the law!"
God bless the people of Ukraine.
Where's the uk?  Where's the US?  Where's nato?  Putin could easily be defeated if civilized countries would stand up and help Ukraine fight back.
There are no strong leaders in the world who could stand against Putin.
We all want peace apparently except putin so russian citizens need to take him out
Ukraine most have the lamest army in the world, the world knew this invasion was coming for weeks.
Does Ukraine have an army? Seems like the Russians are casually strolling in without much resistance 🤔
A nicely aimed Multi warhead ICM aimed at Moscow/Kremlin  would may be Wake Russians up to what they are doing to apparent close neighbours not for the first time either.
Hurrah! Russia is for the truth and peace! 💪🚩🇷🇺
TALK IS CHEAP! PUTIN'S PROPAGANDA PROMISING :NEXT AFTER UKRAINE, WILL  BE ALL EUROPE COUNTIES, STARTING FROM POLAND AND BALTIC COUNTRIES!
Yeah, and they kill civilians like chickens: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-REUO-EMU
F*CK RUSSIA
Why tjey don't first remove all civil innocent people who don't want war in Ukraine, out from coutry, specialy children's and then let dirty politics throws bombs on themselves if they want it so much! I don't understand, this way all people, even those who don't want war are in huge danger for no reason.
NO BODY IS COMING TO HELP , BIDEN HAS HIS HEAD UP HIS ASS SO FARE HE CANT SEE SHIT
Russians You are crazy YOU are KILLING  CHILLDREN. Blood on your hands. We do not want you in Europe I will  never vote to any pollitican who says something good about you. Go to  China. Maybe Putin gives orders but shoots ordinary people who want to  be called solldiers. Be condemned . Ukrainians : remeber  Afganistan Russian could not take it there is still hope. Children and  women you can evacuate to Poland , Polish borders are opened we invite  You. Children can cross polish border without passports, Next to border  help and buses are prepared. We are preparing homes for You. Wellcome  sisters and  brothers
So they're just coming unopposed?? Where's Ukraine's military??
putin, the crook / gangster / dictator commends the Russian army .......does he really care about the Russian soldiers who have lost their lives ?      I don't think so...........Russia and its soldiers ask yourselves why are you fighting Ukraine?
Ukrainian and European media have been lying for 8! years ignoring the people of Donbass. Thousands of ordinary people who are historically Russian were killed and injured in their homes. Just because they wanted to continue speaking their native language. 😢 WHY WAS THIS OK? Why wasn't Europe terrified than? Wouldn't write this if I didn't see real people from Donbass who had suffered from the Ukrainian army. It's unfair! Not a word was spoken in Europe in order to defend these people whose basic rights were infringed by Ukrainian anti-russian government. Nobody  told people in Europe about the real situation. Russia has been trying to negotiate, to tell the truth but it's forbidden in Europe to have another point of view. Democracy, you know... What should Russia do when nobody wants to hear and when at the same time people, actually Russian, are being killed at its borders? Why so unfair??? Real war of information!!! It's getting dangerous to believe media, first talk to real people than form your opinions.
Good chance this is Finland's future as well.
Such a shameful time to be russian. I never wanted this, neither ANYONE among my friends.
When the rich wage war it's the poor that die

You need to deal Peace with Putin. But don't surrender. Ukraine is independent country. Russia invaded Ukraine. Not Ukraine invaded Russia.! Thats not fair if Ukraine surrendered. Thats nosense. Let's fair and generous.
Russian soldiers out of their minds - if they run out of fuel, or get stuck, they have to necessarily throw-away their uniforms and blend in with the populace or get attacked.  so stupid.
Russians You are crazy YOU are KILLING  CHILLDREN. Blood on your hands. We do not want you in Europe I will  never vote to any pollitican who says something good about you. Go to  China.

Children and  women you can evacuate to Poland , Polish borders are opened we invite  You. Children can cross polish border without passports, Next to border  help and buses are prepared. We are preparing homes for You. Wellcome  sisters and  brothers
WTF IS EUROPE DOING... ECONOMIC SANCTIONS  DOESN'T WORK...  THE WHOLE SANE WORLD SHOULD STAND AGAINST RUSSIA. PUTIN IS NOT BEING JUST A BULLY HE'S BEING AN INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST.
Go Putin! Please after you liberate Ukraine, come liberate us from the corrupt comunist criminals that are the E.U.
Ukranians blood and fear is on it's wester partners hands , shame and only shame , they support them just till the fight began , and then left ...
Ukraine's government taunted Russia since 2014. Did they really thought there will be no consequences?
@BBC News, If you ever had any dignity before the Covid crisis, now you have no credit left. You can even show aliens coming down and, obviously, I wouldn't believe any word you're saying and claiming to be NEWS.  BBC, CNN, DW, ABC and all mainstream media are spreading complete nonsense and manipulation.
#russia #ukraine  plese stop war . Stop the war in the name of humanity. Everyone wants to live. What do you get by fighting?Stop the war in the name of humanity. Everyone wants to live. What do you get by fighting?
y'know... just for gits and shiggles, China should munch up Siberia while Tsar Vlad's attention is on his western border
western & world : send pray n love for ukranean.( then move on with their life.. drink coffee,etc)  ukranean people : whats that use for?! send armies for god sake! hello hungary n poland?  hungary n poland : dududu.. pretend not hear..
I was in kyiv in 2015.  It was such a nice place and great to see that the country was trying to be a more open tolerant democracy. And now this happens :/ hope this conflict will resolve it self soon and leaders will return to peace and prosperity
How many more innocent people have to die for these world leaders & elitists who just want power and money? First COVID wipes out millions, crime being rampant killing more, and now a damn war. When will we learn?
Fake news at its best....those are Ukrainian Strela-10 anti-air systems. You don't have to be a military expert to know that you do not assault a city with a weapon which has no ground fighting capabilities, and if these were Russian, wouldn't they been burning already? Do you really believe that there's not a single anti-armor weapon in the entire city? Dafuq is wrong with you people? Also, if this was true, it would mean that Kiev fell this morning, since the vehicle, as mentioned before, has absolutely no ground fighting capabilities(except the crew's sidearms). Secondly, what would any kind of tank/vehicle/apc been doing in an unfamiliar city, driving around the city on its own? Where's the infantry, the fighting? One armored vehicle terrorizing entire city, but the traffic goes on as if nothing is happening? XD
the more russian tanks destroyed makes the world more safe
AMERICA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS. AMERICA WANTED ITS PRESENCE IN UKRAINE TO KEEPAN EYE ON WHOM? NATO RESPONSIBLE AS WELL. WHERE ARE THEY NOW?
The Russian talking at 2:12 is “cherry picking” Putins words. He mentioned Putin of 2008 when Putin said 4 days ago he Wasn’t invading Ukraine. Take advantage of this Weak American leadership while u can!! The Democrats will be Out starting next election. There is Plenty of ad fodder for Anyone That’s Not a Weak arse Democrat
Mother Russia 🇷🇺
Own Tanks run own people down
Russian President do all things remember ICC is waiting for you.
Holy fwkin 24 putin taikin ukraine b force fwk man
One vehicle rushing through just to make ppl panic. Also Ukraine vehicles were seized and used to go deep in. But they all were destroyed Kyiv are on guard there is no way Russian gonna take over shit.
Can you remind us of Cuba an how it was a red line for US. Ukraine is Russia red line.your   double standards are showing.deceiving the masses
Russia saying they're attacking key military outpost and if you lay down your arms and return home you'll be safe... in the first 24 hours I've seen over 2 dozen videos of them blowing up houses, apartment buildings, business and civilian vehicles full of bullet holes.
SO.. WHAT HAPPEN WITH PALESTINE? EVERYDAY ISRAEL ATTACK CHILD AND WOMEN. ISRAEL KILL CIVILIAN AND GENOSIDE PALESTINE PEOPLE !!  WHY ALL COUNTRY IS SILENT !!!! WHY..?????????
Your lie is too obvious BBC. thats why our countries today censored alternative from telling the truth.
Europe is afraid to attack , also the reaction was too late , much too late. Europe is nothing, we should help Oekrain with big weapons and rockets, Europe act like a leader  not like an afraid chicken
Russia is 🐂 enter Ukraine
I'm glad that the Russians are getting taken out
AND why is the UK not sending its troops? they did send a aircraft carrier to South China sea when China started war on no one
Russia: I'll show you who is US & NATO UKRAINE: Lessons learned, never trusted anyone
PUTIN IS A WAR CRIMINAL  STOP HIM NOW!!!!!
Russia needs their asses kicked putin is the new hitler .
fuck BBC shit
NATO is watching from afar. Ukraine reject NATO go back to normal life.
It’s Russians living in Kiev not ukranians. False narrative.  Ukro slang for the Russian cities Kiev as they started writing kyiv won’t go.it’s  Russian genocide. Hopefully Kiev, Harkov, Odessa, Ekaterinoslav, Lvov will be liberated soon. It’s certainly not harkiv and not lviv, you nazis
If only other countries had as much balls as Ukraine to stand up to Russia, Putin doesn’t give 2fucks about sanctions he is happily going to trade with china and india as always only normal people going to suffer through increased prices, whats the point pumping hundreds of billions into military and be afraid to use it,
Fight strong Ukraine 🇺🇦💪🏽
Putin protects his countries interests like everybody elese....nothing special.
The problem is that a moral vacuum is generated when societies promote the idea that God is a myth created by the human mind. This moral vacuum generates people who are more than willing to restrict the freedom of others based on a violation of God's Ten Commandments in Exodus 20 (Ukrainians who do not wish to be part of Russia were accused of being a threat to Russia before Russia invaded). Another big problem of humanity is to pretend that God does not exist or that His Ten Commandments in Exodus 20 are irrelevant to our existence and happiness on this earth.   Wars and rumors of wars is a self-punishment our modern world is giving to itself based on the decision that societies and governments have made making sure that people do not become fully aware of the spiritual, moral, ethical, social, and civic instructions derived from the teachings of our Lord Jesus according to Matthew 5:43-47, Matthew 19:18-19, Matthew 20:26, Matthew 22:21 and Matthew 28:20.   Those spiritual, moral, ethical, social and civic values taught by Jesus are very easy to read, to understand and to keep in mind: People should be taught to abstain from hating anyone, abstain from killing anyone, abstain from raping anyone or any kind of sexual perversity, abstain from robbing any one, abstain from spreading lies against anyone, be proactive in honoring their mother and father and in being proactive in loving others as they love themselves and that it is the role of the government to be a servant to the welfare of all members of society, give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s (this is to pay our fair share of taxes to support basic public services expected from the government), and to God what is God’s (when Russian authorities continued to enforce the Supreme Court’s 2017 ruling that banned and criminalized the activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses as “extremist” by raiding homes, seizing personal property, detaining hundreds of suspected members, and sentencing individuals to prison, Russian authorities usurped the authority of God the only one who should punish us for having a wrong religious opinion); on the other hand, based on Matthew 19:18-20 Jesus has commissioned all those who believe in Him to go everywhere in this world teach those same instructions to every man, woman, and child of this planet Earth.  The destruction of the freedom for self-determination of the people is based on a  gross violation of God's Ten Commandments in Exodus 20 (—a free and independent Ukraine is a military threat to Russia—) this is an example of a violation of God's Ninth Commandment in Exodus 20:16 asking us to avoid making false accusations against other people); therefore, many people end up  being killed through a Russian invasion; injuring and killing people through a Russian invasion is a violation of God’s Sixth Commandment asking us to abstain from killing people. As a result, when people forget about God’s laws, especially God’s Ten Commandments (in the way Jesus taught us how those commandments should be obeyed), the people are destined to hurt and kill each other before falling under the tyranny of a very small elite.  We all need to continually pray that God send powerful angels from heaven so this earth is not dominated by those who are making war to Jesus' words in Matthew 28:18-20 when Jesus said: “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations...."  🙏 🙏 🙏
When NATO does things like this, worldwide, then everyone is silent. Let every evil be equally condemned.
Capital city is the most important city in a country and the Russian military entered the city of Kiev,  Where is the big devil  and vampire(USA)
The vehicles shown at the start, moving through residential areas are NOT tanks. Those are Strela-10 (SA-13 Gopher) surface-to-air short range missile systems. We see no insignia, so they might even be Ukrainians, since it is Soviet era system and both sides have them.
So what Germany did to Poland once upon a time, now Russia does to Ukraine... without Germany and Russia world would be much safer place.
SHAME ON THE WORLD! We can go fight Iraq, we'll invade Afghanistan but don't have the balls to T off on Russia! COWARDS!
Hey Ukraine, wanna borrow a f22 raptor?  Maybe do some trades?
https://youtu.be/5Fr1fYzdtXo Rocket atack on civil house
Is there a go fund me yet to arm Ukraine with some precision missiles?
Thats not tanks plural. Its one tank. Driving randomly as not part of an army at all.. Where is the front line? All the footage online looks deserted. Where are the 200000 soldiers? Where are the 2000 tanks? Not that I want it to he a war but where is the actual war? This is a very awkward war..
Where is the defense?
Little man Putin making Russia not so great again.
Those soldiers of the Putin army are scum and puppets. How could you do something truly so awful like that ?
Bokchod British channel
A narcissistic sociopath is dangerous if he comes to lose the war. Putin is likely to use nuclear weapons at some point.
Do you know, how many children was killed by ukrainian soldiers and how did they killed them for the last 8 years in Donetsk and Luhansk?
Ukraine will hold out about as long as Poland in WW2.
Chamberlain and "Girlie Men"; not a single Churchill;  not a single Chevalier. All Gripped by fear of a Tyrannical Rule already here.
We will defeat this evil-Putin-Hitler !!! Слава Україні!
None wants war. Just we should be friends all people and countries
The serbs entered with tanks in vukovar but left in black garbage bags...
Ukrainians be strong, war will be end soon....🤝🤝
Don't believe western news. Those are Ukrainian tanks they shot down their own plane by "accident" and ran over a random car driving down the street killing 2 civilians don't believe western news! Don't be fools
These media can manipulate and twist things to a completely different stories.. Russian media gives completely different pictures
Bbc propoganda for idiots!!!
Sad that they couldn’t come to an agreement, but that tank is not a Russian tank, in Kiev.
Putin is Khuilo !
BIDEN AND NATO ARE BOTH WEAK,COWARDS AND USELESS ALLIES.😎👎👎  THEY'RE ALL THERE,JUST TO SEE THE SITUATION OF UKRAINE ON HOW They DIE..?😔😔😎WTF!!?😎  WORDS AND SANCTIONS ARE USELESS WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING TO HELP UKRAINE.  PRAY FOR  THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE..😔😔🙏🏼🙏🏼💖
HOT NEWS. GIBRALTAR IS GOING TO SPAIN ACCORDING TO ITS INDEPENDENCE.
By reading the comments it's interesting to note that many blame Russia but some blame Ukraine for the escalation. In my opinion it's the US which is is the most evil one. They were responsible for what we are witnessing now. NATO (read US) could have easily said that Ukraine would not become a NATO member. Instead Zelensky and Biden took a gamble hoping Russia would back off because of the massive economic sanctions threats. Their gamble did not pay off at the expense of so many lives lost of both Ukrainians and Russians.  US gave promises and assurances that US would support Ukraine against Russia. Now that Russia has actually in attacked Ukraine the Americans and her allies are nowhere to be seen. Zelensky said Ukraine is alone in this fight against Russia. US has achieved her objective when Germany announced not ratifying nordstream 2. With US objective met the Ukrainians are left to fend for themselves.  Typical US hit & run tactic.
16 years old!!! Just babies nothing but kids still.... It angers me to see Ukraine all alone in this fight!!!  the USA doesn't want a war with Russia but i promise you russia doesn't want war with the entire world!! We all band together NATO forces and military and we make it known the world is not going to stand for this
Where are their American backers from the last eight year's, where have they all legged it to, why aren't they there with the brave Ukrainians who they sold so many weapons to? Oh, I forgot about the Americans fleeing in panic recently from Kabul, why didn't the Ukrainian Government learn from that American debacle?
I see men who look between the age of 18-60 in that traffic jam. They better give those keys to the women, and go defend their country🤨A real man dies defending his family and his people, not fleeing like a coward. They can't subjugate 40+ million people, especially not with a couple hundred thousand soldiers and a couple billion dollars of military equipment. Logically, Russia can't win, maybe overrun the conventional forces, but they won't be able to occupy the entire nation.
Putin started this war. He could stop earlier. There were no reason to start it.
NUKE THE UK!!! they like poking their noses in other people's business, So cut it off along with everything else from the neck up!!!
I think it’s time to bite the hammer, we have to send troops in, and launch our nukes before Putin does 🤷🏾‍♂️
❤puttin ❤✌️✌️✌️✌️
Get your facts right,, they are Russian tanks, yes,, BUT they belong to Ukraine,, 99% of Ukraine equipment is made in Russia,, SO THAT MAKES BBC out to be LIARS,,
Arrogant leaders on both sides making innocent people to suffer
At least the buses are running
The world must STOP Adolf Putin! Afghanistan 2.0
It's missing Russian white markings. That's an Ukrainian vehicle.
Ukraine fights for human right and freedom. There is no human rights in Russia. Putin can put in jail anybody or ask Kodyrov to kill anybody. If Putin take over Ukraine same will be in Ukraine. People will loose their freedom. Look at Belorus there are millions people peacfully protested where are they now? Ukrain should fight should protect themself and democracy. Otherwise Europe will be next to fight.
Y'all need to do better about your fact-checking. These are Ukraine vehicles. They have no Russian markings.
Kick russia out of the UN until putin is gone.
I'm a high schooler from Turkey, I cannot stop the war, I can only pray for innocent people. Ukrainians are not alone.
Dude, never thought I'd see  gorgeous city taken over like this in my life time...   It's like playing Call of duty Modern Warfare.
again this guy is lying, the only casualty they show is the building who got damaged from  a fallen Russian airplane, civilians are not targeted
Allah help Ukraine
atomic bomb hits moscow
In the meantime Erik is in Irvine, CA doing the ❤️ operation to sabotage the US.
#STOP WAR It is very difficult to believe the people who give hope in advance. As the President of Ukraine is doing. Husband needs to educate people! How much did the US and its Western allies hope that Russia would have to pay the ultimate price if anything happened in Ukraine? .But when the aggression started, everyone became silent. Just showing people the ban could not do anything. America and its Western allies ..
Putin is cleaning Gouaches mess
Why aren't the US, UK, France, Germany and other nations helping the Ukraine? Russia just invaded for lame reason's. They need to leave the Ukraine alone!
I don't see "Z" marks on these vehicles. Why are they moving in such a disarray?
Bomb the Russian fuel trucks!
Putin dont give a fck for your Twitter hashtags
FUCK USA! U ARE WORST OF ALL IDIOTS , FUCK BIDEN SICK OLD MAN JUST WANT WAR NOT RUSSIA !
Putin is hungry for more now the new Joseph stain is going for Poland and the rest of Easter European countries.
Spy Putin has psychologic problem so he must go to hospital
Hello what is this video about please.
Hello I like this video it is good and interesting four me to watch also.
#nowar
Putin is an evil man..Why can't he just live the Ukraine alone...Get a life..
They must fight Ronald Reagan made that point
Of course, I don't think war is desirable. Civilians are pathetic. But I would like to ask when the US-led NATO countries bombed Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, etc., did you pray for them as kindly as you do now?
The Russians see their direct neighbours as their buffer zone against the imperialist west and NATO. This goes back  To WW2. The Russians can never get over that and never will.
first off, thats not a russia armored vehicle. thats a ukranian strela AA armored vehicle. bbc, at least fact check shit before you report on it.  that strela was fleeing a defeat against russia. the AA deuce that was with him didnt make it.
My heart broken , while i watched news on tv ,  the war has begun , keep strong for ukraine ,,,big heart .tears
Пиздаболы..........................
Realistically this is no different than the US invading Iraq.
Poland 1939
Goofy ass tanks
It feels embarrassing to be Russian nowadays. Our army forces turned from defenders of the motherland to a bunch of goons. All the best to the people that reside in Ukraine. Remember that our empathy to your pain knows no limit.
Macron gets rewarded for his failed diplomacy with a soccer final in Paris.
Blow their tanks up
So what you're telling me is as an actual city bus driver here in America, I'm gonna be expected to go to work even if my country is invaded? Did you all see that bus moving in the 1st 50 seconds of this video?
Like I said before all this bs, Should of b52 bombed the entire russian  fortified  boarders before putin can do any more manifested  thinking with his polluted brain 🧠 that needs to catch a buller
I wish to declare war on news reporters that call MRAPs and their ilk tanks.
I'm American and far from a coward.we need a leader bottom line.i do know if we target Russia it would be over with
Not Russian...it has no z on it....
Biden NATO us military ALL COWARDS!! to get tricked into being scared by kremlin disinfo maskirovka threats of nuclear war against a tin pot dictatorship is a joke. remember what happened in turkey? russia threatened nuclear war a week before turkey shot their planes down over syria? guess what their nuclear bluff is ALWAYS a bluff you IDIOTS! biden you should be ashamed of yourself you disgust the world and should resign, you are better than trump but after this and afghanistan not by much.
A man who uses force is afraid of reasoning. -Kenyan proverb
Why we not helping Ukraine this is absolutely absurd 😡
Where's this russian plane wreckage? Heard it was a drone or cruise missile.
It doesn't matter if you for Russia or are Ukraine they need to stop fighting war is wrong
Where is the free world on this? US? UK? Canada? Thats right I forgot, weak leaders.
Why only men 16--60 years are barred from leaving the country. Why not women and gender fluid people also.  Do they think women are weak & can't defend themself and their land 😡!! Zelensky is a misogynst & transphobe. Send Americal army to topple this backword regime and liberate Ukrainian women
Those look like UA tanks.
Why you don't cover the Israeli Crimes like you do now with Russia/Ukraine issue?!!!
As a British citizen,  I am sick of what UK done to Ukraine and Ukrainians people! BBC stop spreading fake news and stop spending licence payers money for your sick goals! We know UK government is bunch of criminals! They must be taken to criminal court! UK people should know, that UK Government is trying to use Ukraine against  Russia! We are not blind! UK hands of Ukraine and Russia! We are brothers and sisters and you won't be able to change this! Bo Jo! Hands of Ukraine!
Putin is our New Hitler.
America and Nato responsible for this disaster where is Nato now just watching  you pulled a helpless country to this and now just watch
Chase them out Give them hell
NATO need to attack Russia
Useless NATO
Is it sleeping looking this ? Shameless united nation
Dear Putin and Zelenskyis stop thingking of war.... The innocent dies in wars.... Did they had in heaven or hell. Instead preach to love one another. Live together happiness. life is short.. Jesus is coming soon.
Support form the West is pathetic, Putin did not and will not give a damn about sanctions. He would rather let his people starve, and most of brainwashed population of Russia will willingly commit to that.
If I was going to war I would attach a machine gun to a drone
what's doing united nation?
Why are u killing innocent people
this is what you get for trusting the west, they thought EU and USA is going to fight against russia, this is what people get for electing a comedian as president.
After USSR split-up Ukraine was the 3rd biggest nuclear weapons country in the world in 1994 (just after US & Russia); about one third of the Soviet nuclear arsenal.  Ukrainian MP Alexey Goncharenko now recalled the Budapest Memorandum how Ukraine gave up nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees from Russia, US & UK.   In fact the memorandum included the security assurances against threats or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. Where are these guarantees now, even during Crimea occupation time in 2014?   During 2014, Pavlo Rizanenko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament said "We gave up nuclear weapons because of this agreement. Now, there's a strong sentiment in Ukraine that we made a big mistake... In the future, no matter how the situation is resolved in Crimea, we need a much stronger Ukraine. If you have nuclear weapons, people don't invade you." ...these sentences he told in 2014.  That is even true in 2022 as well. Ukraine’s former defense minister Anriy Zahorodniuk said “We gave away the nuclear capability for nothing” After 2014 Russia made its economy as independent as possible from the US Doller. It has foreign reserves of around $630 Billion dollars now. The sanctions will have some influence but not so effective.
The U.S/ canada needs to send more troops pronto.
Go for it Putin, you are the best leader. Show them who is the boss. 👍🇷🇺💪🇹🇷
“No matter how paranoid or conspiracy-minded you are, what the government is Actually doing  is worse than you imagine.”   ~  William Blum
It's a pity the price of petrol keeps going up. I love a good fight with molotov cocktails.
Jesus, how stupid u people r! When Russian tanks enter Kiev, u want see  any videos. Russian tanks and trucks have big letter Z on them!
Liberation of Ukraine!!
Ukraine will be a part of Russia in just few days .
Denying WEST and their policy would bring peace to the world!! People should unite together!
We watched Iraq 🇮🇶 Libya 🇱🇾 And Money More dying, I hope we don’t watch Ukrainians. It is Time to say no war. The world 🌎 is gift From Allaah we should enjoy and live safely in it not destroy.
Damn it’s sad how males between 18-60 are banned to leave Ukraine, not everyone wants to fight (and die).
Can we just settle this with a bottle of Stolichnaya?
Everyone supports gender equality until some real shit goes down. The men are the ones who will need to stay behind and fight.
Lie. STOP LIE.
All soon , will  be over ,  Russia  has already  won . This   war is NOT against Ukraine , but  against  stupid    American libtards and  democrats , who still believe , that they  can one day control  and rule the world.
Seriously what’s the point of having a UN?
Why do u lie more!
hypocrites nato give us back kosovo🇷🇸🇷🇸🇷🇸🇷🇸
Canada needs to stay the fuck outta this we have enough problems at home with our dictatorship
It's a disgrace Ukraine didn't settle things peacefully with the Eastern territory for the past 8 years, which Russia did for them. Not to mention forbidding the use of Russian language. That's some way of "protecting your sovereignty." Please subscribe,..................    https://youtu.be/X2uXP3M5Rpo
I remember a Soviet City called "Kiev." If I am not mistaken, Ivan had a Naval installation there.  Now, the Borscht eaters have started fighting one another, and suddenly we all become a bunch of Beta males kissing their Vodka soaked asses, and spelling shit in their back ass cyrillic mumbo jumbo code.  NO!  It was KIEV before, not "kiyviv(backweards r)istan and it is Kiev now. If Ivan doesn't like it, we can take it out back and settle it once and for all.  You were issued a set of BALLS, Murca. Use them!
Why the ukranian army isnt fighting?
There after the boss. This seems to be the objective. Force a capitulation and become the ultimate arbitrator of the country preventing its expansion into Nato. I say  if it avoids a full scale World War. Let him have it under certain conditions. Because he won't stop until the country, its military and Parliament buildings, are in Russian hands.
Uhhh
0:30 those people in the bus are probably thinking "F*ck"
Give them hell!      SLAVA UKRAINI! ❤️💪
Soon Ukraine will be ours .. West mind your own business own business . And duck off your sanctions we don't care soon Georgia rest will be free , If America come they will die so don't cross your line doggy America
No more killing, please.❤✌🙏😭
Americans are now facing their hypocrisy as they forget about Afghanistan and Iraq.  Russia is stuck in the 1850's,  maybe things will change.  The bad things need to stop,  with the way things are going, who knows?
This is what UK/ US / NATO wanted blood of innocents . Same like what they have done in Iraq, Syria  and libiya  killed millions of innocents in the name of so called democracy
Fuck nato
Fucken illuminati
One more thing.. Shame on West,  “Democratic  “ world . Why You all,at all,doing some parades,with your military equipments,when,You not use that !???? How many innocent people should be dead,before will You, Powerful Nations,finally do something ? Nobody doing anything..we just watching straggling of Ukraine People,just like..watching some movie !? And nobody do anything,to Really help ?? Shame on You..All of West Democracy  Shame
WHERE THE FU*K IS AMERICA AND THE EU??? WHERE IS EVERYONE???RUSSIA CAN BE STOPPED IN A DAY IF PEOPLE JOIN BUT NO, NO ONE GIVES A SH!T, DISGUSTING!!!
Weak leaders gives you wars
A lot of pictures not seeming very logical. 2 single tanks alone up front? Public buses still in service? shots of low flying helicopters? Everybody leaving but not able to use available capacity? Just 1 lane into the city seems too much for this emergency. These are no war scenes.
Pick up my RPG,  hop on a bus, destroy a Russian tank in the resistant community.
Putin cross the red line shame on Russia he like to kill women & children shame on Russian people who let that happen
Pronounced KEY EV.   Not Keev
Men are barred from leaving the country? What about the Feminists??
I'm from Ukraine please 🥺 pray 🙏 for me 😭😭😭
https://youtu.be/Fw5oC2-cmGI
Send  70-100k US army troops to ukraine, and recruit more soldiers. How will putin feel about that! And send 4000 tanks and 100 choppers XD
FUCK RUSSIA
Let me guess the Ukraine army got DESTROY......
Where is the film footage of the Russian tank running over the car
Thank you BBC for this. Freedom Fighters have been suffering like we can't imagine. The children? It would  cost America 50,000 troupes to even make the Russians think about leaving. What else in that region was invaded?
China could be next.
Ukraine politicians should’ve spent money on National Defense when they first got their freedom & independence from the old Soviet Union 30 years ago and kept all that left behind nuclear arsenal !   Instead they blew the money 💵 on stupid stuff like Wel Fare and corruption ….. now look at them.  Dummies !!!!!’
Obama said it best: "if you want to screw something up, you put Joe Biden on the job"
The footage on the tanks to the left of the screen were from Tanks in Atlanta, Georgia USA not Russian Tanks! This whole situation is unbearable!
Love how they didn't show that tank running over a moving car moments beforehand, luckily the driver some how survived. Disgusting.
Just surrend if you dont want war...
World..UN...should prepare , court, for , Vladimir Putin ! For same actions, like Hitler was doing..80 years ago . Putin should not be respect more,like legitimate president of Russia ! From all democratic world..He should be completely isolated. Nobody more,should have any more dealings,with that evil Man. Russia should awake,and people of Russia should take action,to change their completely leadership. This is enormously wrong ! I’m sure,people of Russia not need this shame .
Not a Russian Military vehicle …BBC propaganda
7 russian planes have been shot down,,,,,and ukrain doesnt even have an airforce or airfield or chopper left
Putin is a terrorist. Please help our country for the sake of people. Ban Russia from SWIFT! Protect Ukrainian Sky! Send NATO to Ukraine! #BanRussiafromSwift #CloseTheSky #SendNatoToUkraine
why doe?
https://youtu.be/JZpgOzwOqqg
Soldiers should protect country not attack other country.
This could have all been avoided.
The aircraft that she mentions that was shot down has been debunked and it was shot down in Syria many years ago. Putin has asked the Ukraine Military to seize control of the Ukraine and to remove the corrupt leadership WEF affiliates from power. They want peace without the corruption.
F*CK PUTIN!!!!!
all ukraine had to do was stay neutral dont join nato because that will put nato rockets close to russia,but ukraine government still pursue becoming a member now ukrainians are suffering
Another disaster caused by NATO.
Send some Taliban advisors to Ukraine, Russia will get a taste of what Soviet Union had to face in Afghanistan.. let's goo!
Send US army 70-100k troops to ukraine, and recruit more soldiers. How will putin feel about that
Putin is a Hitler wonnabe.
Execute any caught Russian troops
Keep up the great journalism. Here in America it’s hard to find the real news.
Bravo putin
battle; nothing but fear and misery. It burns, it destroys, it kills, it destroys. May God help Ukraine our prayers are with you 😰
Where is the mouthy US now?
BBC propaganda in full swing. Those tanks she was talking about were Ukraine's tanks and the plane shot down was Ukraine's  MIG-29.
fuck that troll dwarf putin fuck that 3rd world cuntry russia
We never excuse NATO, they are guilty & middlemen.
And again - Europe is just watching!
thats not a Russian tank in the thumbnail thats a Ukrainian Strela
Judging by the images many Ukrainians are leaving their country and I'm not saying this is good or bad but again judging by many videos in Youtube many are leaving.  Do they really support their president? what do they really think about him and his government?  Greetings from Mexico, we all hope this war ends as soon as possible, stay safe Ukrainians!!!
Slava Ukrajini!!!🇺🇦🇭🇷✌
Z if it has this Z on it it is Russian if not it is Ukrainian. As they use many of the same machines the Russians Use the Z on their machines to identify them in battle. FYI.
Great job great 👍 👌 👏 Russia 🇷🇺 👏
You fucked up putin. You really messed up this time. You attacked a country that didn't attack you. 🤦‍♂️

Fight For Ukraine!!!
Love from Kerala 💛
Как можно так нагло врать??? Этой ложью вы заставляете русских НЕНАВИДИТЬ англичан!!!
NOTE:  OVER 3838 russian soldiers KILLED (Underground Source)   UPDATE:  Accurate information below, of troops, the 2014 invasion, what's happening in the background and new objectives.   1. Donbas Region -Russia "putin" wants to annex this one next to continue the land bridge to Crimea because they never got to do this on their first assault due to Ukrainians fighting back. After pushing them back the so called rebels "LITTLE GREEN MEN - I DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE" putin said, Ukrainians started attacking Crimea and at the same time the Donbas region. The Ukrainians directed their attack mostly in the Donbas region due to being a industrial hub of the country.. they almost got it back but russia "putin" interfered and the same went to Crimea. It's never about the invasion, NATO, or whatever reason(s) putin uses.. it's outside of the picture and you need to understand this monster in a way you never done before. You don't play the chess-board even when you're a pawn! You play the game in order for you to be part of it but this does not mean your actually there playing it. You're dealing with putin that keeps taking because you keep giving by losing.   2. russia wants to connect the Donbas region to Crimea "taking over all warm water ports that Ukraine has" all the way to Moldova. The thing about this is.. the main focus will be the Capital of Ukraine but the main target is The land bridge. But if russia "putin" see a window within the scopes of multi formation attack.. then Donbas will connect all the way to Poland/Baltic States to land-bridge kaliningrand "a Belarus gateway."  3. putin isn't stupid to invade the entire country "he can do this" but he won't be able to hold it together for a very long time. That's currently the information we got from my Russian military friends in "Mother Russia" aka Belarus, Donbas region, and Crimea.  4. U.K. Hacked and shut down. Ukraine hacked and shut down several days ago. Canada hacked and shut down earlier today. Who's next!  5. Two Georgian states - Information not available.     NEW NATO FORMATION:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9rfWFLgYCg  VERY INFORMATIVE INFORMATION 02/19/2022   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQdIiLt-4iI  Predicted with new INFO  https://www.yahoo.com/news/putin-may-launch-invasion-of-ukraine-in-donbas-region-analysts-say-230334521.html  Recap History:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK-yJD_fAtk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRTakARMODE  THE MAIN OBJECTIVE AND EVERYTHING ELSE MANIPULATION: 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGaa2sSoDgg&t=334s 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axEiFZURXaM  Current situation now:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omz0od9fP_U   Events:  1992 Barcelona Olympics: Invasion of Moldova. 2008 Beijing Olympics: Invasion of Georgia. 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics: Invasion of Ukraine. 2022 Beijing Olympics: Current Actions "Pending" but imminent. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Here's the problem with your statement comrade. If U.S. was part of the USSR and it became like Ukraine "okay." You have a lot of russians living in the U.S. So what you're saying is putin thinks he cane invade it because the government think very different than his and that everyone in it or most of the people in U.S. are russian.. so putin wants to "MERGE" both country and he becomes dictator in both countries for life. Is this what you said here MF? because I think you need to fraking wake up. This is not 1945 and shi t, it's actually 2022 in the 21st century.   AGAIN, THE PURPOSE OF THIS SHI T IS TO PREPARE FOR WAR IN THE FUTURE/ troops readiness and equipment staging are key principle for future conflict and at the same time.. looking at opportunities and vulnerabilities and how others would respond. And at the same time... look and read below:   After placing 198k troops on your border.. what do you expect huh? You have to learn to think magical my friend like fairies.  So putin doesn't want Ukraine to join NATO but it wants it to join the Russian block. What the F? Well, F putin. UKRAINE FOR NATO/EU.  How can you give respect to the person who invaded his neighbor for his gain only? Don't join NATO because I will put another Belarus dictator near you and you will join my alliance instead like that gas prices act in neighboring kazakhstan. MF is a made up hype to make things look real and for putin's army to march with their chest up lol   And the Belarus event was to test the outcome of the invasion "PEOPLE" how Poland would respond, how much military can be prepared on that area when it's happening, what's the focus point and how it would be overwhelmed. These are in-placed to see the reaction on multiple location points in real time after the decision has been made.    NOTE:  Here's the best part of this story!   putin INVADED Ukraine's Crimea region because under that "OCEAN" there's a very old and the biggest pyramid in the entire world under that ocean floor. Plus putin's palace 2 is in Ukraine Crimea Peninsula. The so called "WARM WATER PORT" for it's navies. Everything is starting to make sense now at least to me. This guy has specific objectives.. This is like playing chess but you have to not play it in order for you to win. So you let putin win by not letting him win. But what the "WEST" is doing.. preparing like chess, each time putin moves.. they counter that move! For me.. that's not bad but if you look very closely.. you will understand all of these MFs objectives. Solution: Stop playing the guy's game and actually get multiple things moving before he moves that PAWN AGAIN...    IT'S BETTER TO FIGHT AND DIE RATHER THAN BE A COWARD AND LET PUTIN JUST INVADE.  WHAT ARE YOU STUPID OR SOMETHING?   XLXXC...
Ukraine should have been laying mine fields down as Russia was amassing. Take a page out of the Vietnamese war, if they want a fight, give them one!
Time to turn up the heat on Putin!!! Putin is Evil!
why is no one helping this country?
How to separate fact from propaganda in a war situation?
00:11 that's not a Russian vehicle.  What you are seeing is a Ukrainian air defence vehicle (SA-13 Gropher) taking up position.  Russian vehicle assets in this war has white Z or V markings to distinguish themselves. Moreover, the russians did not deploy this type of vehicle to the war (they are outdated). They deployed newer PANTSIR variant of vehicle. Very misleading reportings by BBC.
9km away is literally a 10 minute drive depending on traffic... Pretty sure any car would yield if you're pulling through with a tank 🤷🏾‍♂️😂
https://youtu.be/yY2tn7ATL_4 Korea's Democratic Party presidential candidate said, "The Ukraine stimulated, Russia causing war."
Our condolences, citizens Ukrainians, but it is very necessary for the president Biden that Russia got bogged down in war with the Ukrainian Nazis, and he could finish with China. Your comedian Zelenskyy did not even know what he set on fire (ше was your asses).  Ukrainians and Russians it is the same people. Just Ukraine was taken by pro-NATO puppets and tried to sic Russians on Russians. There is no democracy in NATO. There is only the American military industrial complex. In NATO there is no free press, only a lie, a lie, a lie, a lie
Joe Biden’s weak self fault
do that retardet Lavrov and Nazi Putler think that now he will win Ukraine to their side? They will never comply now even if russia will put there some puppet
it’s already 2022 and our life is still dictated by a few men so called “leader”
Protest against Putin's dictatorial empire attacking Ukraine. Putin and his interests have ruled Russia for too long, so an ego that is too big will be a disaster for the World.
Fuck the Ukraine prime minister. He has been stealing from his people and forcing them into poverty. Now Putin is cleaning house for the old empire.
For achieving peace, need more action. The most sad thing is, International community, UN, Western county, NATO doing nothing to against Russia’s invasion and let more and more peoples die. If this trend rises,  Ukrainian’s suffers on our head one day.😔😔😔
Protest against Putin's dictatorial empire attacking Ukraine. Putin and his interests have ruled Russia for too long, so an ego that is too big will be a disaster for the World.
All you hear is we stand with Ukraine from other nations. If you give a shit you'd be sending weapons they need to defend. The west is weak as shit.
“Should have thought about that before” nothing!
if bbc filming from window then how so sure tanks are russian?
Obviously, the Russians have met light to zero resistance. Their intentions are equally obvious, they intend to take the whole country. They will then place Russian sympathisers in all key leadership positions of Government, and rewrite the Ukraine Constitution to assure their dominance.
Accept them into NATO and fight back.
cant wait for putin assasination :D
And no one talks about genocide against Russian people in Ukrainian, that lasts for 8 long years, no one talks about hundreds of thousands people who left Ukrainian and run to Russia to save their life, I live in southern Russia, 2 hours from Donbas, so I met a lot of them. You all see just one side of it all, keep it in mind ☝🏻
TOUSANDS WILL BE KILLED. WHY NOT KILL JUST ONE PUTIN - PROBLEM SOLVED
Neto and America are false oppressors. 😡😡 They fled, endangering Ukraine😭
BBC Fake News 🤮🤮🤮
THERES .... a sense of RUSH in russia's actions ...I FEEL IT !
Horrible for Ukraine and for the world! All must speak against this but always support ways to stop Russia’s aggression.
Remember to turn your prayers and wishes into donations or actual helpful items sent to Ukraine. This is tragic.
One Tank.. Russia is invading kiev🥴
And USA has become the biggest pussy in the entire planet
too proud to accept Minsk as a meeting place to discuss peace says it all
No "Z" those look like Ukrainian hardware. There were reports of Russian soldiers stealing Ukrainian vehicles near Kyiv, so maybe that or they cleaned off the "Z"?
I see comments in several videos saying that the tank in the video was actually Ukrainian.  Is there any proof that the tank is Russian or Ukrainian?  Also it seems kinda weird that there's only one single "Russian" tank running around Kiev like that, hmm...
Western d!rty media, go go...Russia Army ❤️
Boris sleping...
That's a video of a Ukrainian armored vehicle, the Russians have white Z on them. Damn and the jet shot down was Ukrainian, friendly fire. So much misinformation, shame on you....
Our condolences, citizens Ukrainians, but it is very necessary for the president Biden that Russia got bogged down in war with the Ukrainian Nazis, and he could finish with China.

USA and other western countries are big time cowards and left Ukraine alone in such disastrous time. They had to send NATO forces to defend Ukraine and prove to Putin that he can’t do such shameful actions to a NATO country. But NATO proved to be a hoax and just doing lip service. They can only brutalise poor countries and totally unable to defend their allies . Leaving their friendly countries in dire conditions of life and death is their old tradition.
it will result in more hatred toward russian people..putin must stop his greedy adventure
It's all good, russian military bitchez in Kyiv were eliminated. Glory to Ukraine!
Where are the Ukrainian soldiers or their cops?
Russian President Putin thinks he's up against a world full of snowflakes ❄.  He just might be right
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺❤️❤️❤️❤️
Heartbroken to see what's happening in Ukraine, people don't have to die, those are some lovely people.
Вы наглые лжицы!!! Надо бомбить Лондон!!!
Fellow victims, welcome to Africa.
This is completely senseless.  Russia is a huge country with a declining population.   Why attack a small neighbor?  Russia has nothing to gain.  Putin is out of control and it is up to people in Russia to stop him!
Nato condenm 😂. NATO (No Actions Talk Only)
NATO And America had provoked this sad situation and they left alone to Ukrainian. what a ridiculous.
After second world war, who killed most people , destroyed most countries prosperity, made innocent citizens to refugees ? Please answer.
Love Ukrain from Turkey! I just want this to stop what's happening are horribl please stay strong brothers and sister <3 The world is with you
assasins
So this little short man syndrome Putin who is still butt hurt from a failed communism Russia wants all this on his legacy? What a freak of nature his mom and dad had.
MOLOTAV COCKTAILS   WOLVERINESSSSSSSSSSSS
How are sanctions against Russia going to help Ukraine in the short run?
There is no Russians in the video, its just some tank driving somewhere, even president biden could drive it !  lol its all just words..
It doesn't seem very coordinated by the Russians, looks like rogue tanks here and there, very strange.
Cmon Usa lift ur planes! Start it, its gone be what is gone be!!
Well it just goes to show when you do dealings with a drug addict and his two-timing father they might not always have your back maybe Ukraine shouldn't put all their eggs into the Biden basket
Российские войска в 20 километров от Киева, это украинский танк
heard the plane was Ukrainian Su107  not Russian
Это украинский танк
So marshal law is stopping men of fighting age from leaving. I personally think that's wrong. It will be a massacre for those who don't have fight in them.
WHERE WAS ALL THIS "SYMPATHY", WHEN UKRAINE GOVT. ALLOWED FASCIST UKRAINIANS, IN 2014 ODESSA TO BURN UP RUSSIAN UKRAINIANS😭
wtf america. step tf up
I remember innocent people in Damascus begging for rescue when they were trapped inside their city …
Stop saying you are sorry! That doesn’t help! Adress your governments, demand action, support Ukraine militarily and politically. Strike Russian leaders and their families hard. Make them non grata persons, take their money, arrest their accomplices.
That was not a plane, but a rocket(ukrainians themselves confirmed it).
This is not a video game these people are really going to die  people and die Putin is insane to do this
😪😪😪😪😪my family nd I will be praying 4 u all OMG💔
Such bullshit this video. Us and Nato mind your own bussines. You are the cancer
Trying to start a war in 2022, pathetic.
Good 👍 fuck usa 🇺🇸 and Biden hope Russia 🇷🇺 does them all in. Fuckin trash 🗑
and those mofos are driving over civil cars whit people inside. "were not harming civis" my ass
Gallows for putin and laverov war criminals
Looked like Ukrainian vehicle.. Doesn't have the Russian markings
Where is america? Hiding in their money bins.
Please pray for Ukraine
They are not tanks , they are APCs
Give Alaska the intel.🙄🙄 AP/Capital restricted Zone!  - playing with my bean counter.
Does no one cubian missile crises
If US could just enter black sea it will not happen. As of now japan is the proxy at the black sea.
It was a Ukraine plain was it not?
2 vehicles were crushed by tankers! Heartwrenching to watch! Praying for Ukraine's families! Stay safe🙏🇺🇦❤️🇨🇦
I wish they'd try and invade the US. Especially the south. They would get destroyed by us.
Why did all people wait till the last second to try and leave
What is the cause of all these hostilities?
Don’t kill
Putin is an old disgusting animal. He is not balanced.. Enough that Trump praise him. Two pieces of sheet.
You poking a sleeping bear for long time so expect the consequences that your arm will eventually get ripped off!
It’s Ukraine President and USA should be blamed for this
We are in WW3 ….
$200 billion donated to Ukraine's military ( over 4 years )  ... 4 years later - NOT a single US made military weapon in sight ... so - where did the $ 200 Billion ... go ?
What russian tank was that?
I don't get how we don't intervene here...
Usless media ... what a hell are you talking about, this is Ukrainian armored vehicles. it's confirmed
Much more peaceful and calm than the brutal invasion of Iraq where hundred of thousands were killed .
Call Greta
Putin just became a new Hitler and Russian army a new Wehrmacht. Shame on Russians.
The USA and NATO f…gote this is the WAR that the US and NATO wanted and now they do like its only a ukranian problem.  So i you are real man stand with boots on the ground with the ukranian people
Imagine what the baltic states are thinking right now. This is going to be them in the near future.
This is the Best Written Explanation on what’s happening in the Ukraine   COPIED   NATO tried to put military bases and missiles POINTING at RUSSIA into Ukraine... which is illegal under NATO and the Ukraine Constitution... Putin said if you try... we will stop you... you'll note he NEVER said he would INVADE...NEVER...  When Putin said this NATO pulled its troops BACK... so Putin WON but did not fire  shot...and the West (which runs NATO) said well... we might still CONSIDER  putting missiles into Ukraine... so Putin put 100,000 troops and tanks on the border and said... BETTER NOT you stupid little iriot naughty boys... so Putin won round two...so NATO  and the God of Dxmentia  said we might look at sanctions...and accused Putin of warmongering....so the Ukraine President  came out and said ...Putin is NOT the threat and he will NOT invade... so PUTIN  won yet again... and the mxrons in the West Just went back to the FAKE NEWS MEDIA  and created more BS stories for.people to.pick up 🥰.. and still the West did nothing ... except threaten to get the girly-girl  who pretends to run France involved which he couldn't do because he is just another useless  mxron... so PUTIN won again...and by now the West and NATO are looking Iike a couple of Eunuchs... so the next thing that happens  is that the Ukraine subversives INSIDE Ukraine  start shooting at the Russian quarters  INSIDE UKRAINE (which makes up about 1/3 of.the population and about half of the States... they're pro-Russia..... this action sponsored by the West to cause trouble for Putin...   in other words a West sponsored CIVIL CONFLICT... but did Putin attack...NO HE DID NOT... he sent peacekeeping forces into THAT particular section and stopped the Russians shooting at the Ukraine separatists...and advised the separatists if they fired at the Russians, he would have to stop them... he did all this without firing a shot..  So there was NO INVASION...so Putin won again... now the West looks really, really stupid..  They have withdrawn NATO  FORCES...they have no chance of getting a NATO missile base into Ukraine... it requires an Act.of Parliament and the Pres. Himself now says NO...and now Putin has peacekeeping forces INSIDE UKRAINE...so Putin wins again! (Wait! Wasn't NATO supposed to be the peacekeepers not the warmongers... sorry that went out the window when they became a Brando patsy)... so.much WINNING for Putin, going on right under your noses... and  the penny hasn't dropped... NO INVASION  and now he is INSIDE UKRAINE as a peacekeeper... making the West, Mr Dxmentia, NATO, Boris etc. Look like the completely incompetent jerks they are... so NOW.. The juicy bit .. Putin is INSIDE Ukraine,  the Ukraine  Pres approves.... So now NATO or the WEST will have to INVADE if they want to do anything about it..  It's  virtually game over... Putin has snookered the mxrons 🤣🤣
Ukraine was a fool believing the west would aide them should have negotiated with Putin and not join nato
200 BILLION over 4 years ... & Ukraine's says ... " we are not good enough - we need a more robust leader to tell them to stop "
God bless the Ukrainian people and keep them safe
All Taiwanese now are watching and praying for Ukraine people and President. Don't surrender to the Tyranny. What Putin does is not tolerable... We also concern that China will attack sooner or later. And we will fight back just like brave Ukrainian.
Ukrainians are fighting not only for their freedom, but also for the freedom of the entire Eastern Europe. Not to sound too dramatic, but every drop of blood their spill, every russian plane they shoot down, every russian tank they destroy increase the changes of turning out those, who fell for the retarded russo-fascist propaganda.
The UK and US promised Ukraine security after they gave up nuclear weapons in 1990s, as part of an international agreement. Where is the protection? Cowards.
If the United States gets invaded one day will the public fight back?
Вот заливают-то, твари. Это украинская техника!!!
Same things happen in Afghanistan, Iraq, syria, Palestine and it's doing by US
"Devil's Politics in England". It is the destruction of Arab territories and the destruction of their territories when they do not feel it is necessary to form a political home or political people who have a message of peace. Enough laughter and deception of people who will not play the role of you, there is no way, enough tampering with poor countries, and war and wreaking havoc on the countries who have decided to make peace.
How are you going to declare martial law in your country when its being attacked? You cant defend it and then bar all men from 18 to 60 from leaving?  I hope the men havnt listened these criminals running ukraine are asking their men to get slaughtered. next they too will have a lgbt community after generations of their children being molested and abused by members of dark orders. Ask the US.. WW1 and 2 destroyed western patriarchy so the weirdos could rule.
How did they invade so fast?
不得不说，带英拍的图像👍
WHY US& EU ABANDON UKRAINE???
The president won't be killed but he will be taken prisoner if he stays. That is likely anyway.
Hopefully Putin sends in all 140k+ troops. That way all NATO allies can join in at once and deal a fatal blow to the Russian Army. I always wanted to die in a nuclear war, /S
America is the agresor!
Stay strong Ukraine ❤️The whole world is supporting your fight! And to the people of Russia - many of you oppose this war. I know that great courage is needed for this in your country nowadays, but you are courageous. Do something - there are many of you, organize yourselves, request help from outside - you must set this stupid, dangerous idiot aside!
BBC is good chanel for nature docs just a opinion
Those are definitely not Russian tanks, they're AA vehicles. Those vehicles don't travel in the vanguard, so there is no way they got in without infantry support. They are definitely Ukraine AA, not Russian. Why are news networks these days so full of dumbasses?
I hope these criminal actions taken against a sovereign nation end up with the eventual collapse of the Russian federation. They deserve nothing less.
PUTIN MAD
The Ukrainian people are innocent, but the leader of Ukraine is a puppet government and will do anything to please nato, also boris Johnson is a idiot who broke his own laws so I don’t know why he is sitting there acting like Winston Churchill when he and America did the same thing Russia did for example invading Vietnam, Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq and throws bombs on Syria and Yemen when they feel like it , not killing terrorists but killing innocent civilians as we all know that the terrorists help America and it’s allies get richer, allowing illegal trade and stealing natural resources, furthermore even tho Russia is in the wrong, they don’t want nato near them so nato should butt out of There politics, and why doesn’t nato say all this to China who kill Muslims for no reason and steal other countries land, which is also an invasion, to conclude the uk and the USA are all Hippocrates who do the same thing as Russia but just  want to cause some drama with this tension to make themselves look better in the face of their people and just.
0:35 ... DECLINED invitation of ( NATO ) for pat 35 years - UKRAINE doesn't have & never wanted any ... "partners" " Ukraine needs help from partners "
Hello everyone, I'm from Russia. Everything is not as clear as they tell you. The majority of Russians are against war, no one wants it, we are a fraternal people and it is very sad that the power play leads to such consequences for civilians. BUT, it all started in 2014 in the DPR (Donetsk People's Republic) And the LPR (Luhansk People's Republic), when Ukraine started bombing and shelling these republics. 8 YEARS of civilians (among them the Russian military) The LPR and the DPR suffered and were afraid that at some point a shell would fly into their house. And that's how the real Russian army came, Ukraine immediately became a victim. That is why some residents of Ukraine (especially the DPR and LPR where people took to the streets and thanked) are very happy about the entry of Russian troops into Ukrainian soil. But again, this is not a method of conflict resolution. I'm for peace.Just my English, I write through a translator.

AMERICA NEEDS TO SEND TROOPS TO UKRAINE TO STOP THE RUSSIAN FORCES!!!!!!!
Ya allah save ukrain.from Philippines
Ukraine chose to side to ally with the west instead of its powerful neighbor. Looks like they chose the wrong side to ally with… as there allies just silently watch from a distance. I’m American btw, even I know you can’t trust American government.
Only Putin can Save them..... ✨😈✨
Prolong for views /lol

If they want War. Why they won't go in to dessert Place to fight not the in cities of country for the civilian. This is my opinion if you disperate to make war go to dessert or for WAR no bodys care even 20 years long fight but it keep away from civilian. Pray for Stopping the WAR let your soul touch of LOVE 💕💕💕 and afraid of JESUS CHRIST
Alex Jones was right.
The Russian Hitler Putin should be stopped immediately and charged with crimes against humanity.
But i saw Russian tanks marks with z. They are not marked. Something wrong?
May the people that are worried, hiding in train stations, stay safe. To the ones that are fighting on this war, be safe. To the ones that are in their homes terrified, stay safe ❤️ To the ones that have lost family members and friends may god be with you and hopefully you can feel calmer in these terrible situations. Just so you know their are millions praying for you on these moments ❤️‍🩹 🇺🇦
Shame on Putin
It's not Russian armour. Ukrainian.
Those aren't even Russian tanks
thats an ifv to be exact
That is "Streal" and its Ukrainian not Russian.
"Unless a nation’s life faces peril, war is murder." -- Atatürk 🇹🇷

Biden puss. He is transgender
saba mozete u evropu kao humanitarni emigranti. Srecno
The vehicle in the video looks like a SAM (surface to air missile) launcher, not a tank. It specifically looks like a SA-13 Gopher. Seems unlikely it would be Russian given how vulnerable it would be to light antitank weapons if deployed in this fashion. Probably just Ukrainian air defenses repositioning.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9K35_Strela-10
Fuck the new Hitler terrorist Putler
No one learn from wars. The human is still stupid. After destroying every thing they will shake hands and stop wars. Later they make the same mistake and so on!!!
If Ukraine wants peace, why are they still asking for NATO membership? People should know that NATO was a group founded just to destroy Russia. Any nation who isn't a member of NATO have a right to protect themselves.
Nuke russia💚
Dear UK, can we please have one Sky Sabre to help us protect our sky? Save Ukraine!!!
Its disgusting how cowardly other countries have been. This should have been met with near instant strike from NATO countries to cripple Russian forces.
At this rate Ukraine won't last a week
I sympathize with the children and civilian lives that are in peril... They need to evacuate those people from the country... I caution the world when I ask, "Is it worth being a King to rule over a pile of ashes for a kingdom?"
fight fight fight 🥊🥊🤛🤜🥊
Amazing how NATO and the WEST have driven a wedge between two countries, who were basically very good friends  for decades.     NATO and the WEST planning on installing missiles on the Ukraine 🇺🇦 Russia 🇷🇺 border was not a good idea after all.
1:14 Champions league will move to Paris  People dying in war and football,  all the same important to them
China can now take Taiwan
All I'm gathering from this comment section is that everybody is placing blame on everyone and nobody is taking responsibility and apparently since I was born in an American and the politicians who I saw vehemently hate decided to do some messed up stuff I know have no say on this entire situation makes sense honestly all I'm getting is that we are a bunch of monkeys and we are going to destroy this planet maybe this is the kick we need maybe world war 3 is the best thing for humanity maybe we do need to Nuke ourselves into Oblivion because we're just going to cause so much hardship for others
BBC you blind? the tank that rolled over a car is a very old Tank. Russia dont use this model for years! its clearly a ukrainian vehicle. But i understand and forgive you...dissinformation is what you get payed for from NATO.  I WANT PEACE FOR EVERY SINGLE BEEING ON EARTH!! but with a Devil Killing Machine NATO this will be not possible
This is not a Russian, but a Ukrainian tank !!! (there have been no such old "tanks" in the Russian army for a long time, and at that time the Russians had not yet entered Kiev). People! Today the BBC exposed itself as Fake Garbage!!!
😂😂😂😂 another British propaganda about Russia:450 Russia soldiers dead how do Colonialist,corrupted souls destined for Hell know the number of deaths whilst not at centre where the bone meets the meat?
18 to 60 years old can’t get out of the city from Ukrain, what! They want to use civilians as a human shields, what a nasty action, that is thanks to the clown 🤡 Selenzki
Ah yes. It is *so* courageous, and heroic to bomb civilians, their homes, and intimidate them in the name of freeing them of "Western opression" only to unveil an iron curtain, and impose freedom... As long as they follow Putin's rules.
I mean who has the right to kill and attack someone,this is violation of him an rights and mental and physical oppression
Knock them out just like the Chechens did.
That tank actually its an Ukrainian tank that got lost from its convoy and apparently it is searching for it. These things should be double checked before making such assumptions saying its Russian. Not defending Russia at all by the way..
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺👍👍👍♥️♥️♥️
Russia never short of a warning.. Ukraine made a hard choice for the sake of Its Allies US and NATO undermining Citizens security.
what a load of b0ll0cks
the people need to take up arms, put down the camera and start shooting. They aren't prepared for guerrilla warfare, so give it to them!
The Bible tells us there will be wars and rumors of war. The most important thing for all of us and our families and all of the Ukranian and Russian soldiers and people to do is to be spiritually prepared for our eternal lives by repenting of sin and accepting Jesus Christ, God on earth, as our Savior Who was born one of us to die and resurrect from the dead to pay for our sins for us to reconcile us sinners with God, to give us eternal life with Him, by believing that:  Jesus Christ came down here from heaven, God on earth, to be born one of us His own creation, and He dwelt among us for over three decades and He lived a perfect sinless life, then He gave His perfect sinless life to all people from all nations to pay for our sins for us, by dying on the cross and resurrecting from the dead three days later, to pay for our sins and defeat death for us to reconcile us sinners with God to give us eternal life with Him, and after He resurrected from the dead, He lived on earth for forty more days, speaking to many people, then He ascended back up into heaven and He is coming back again at the end of this world to set up His eternal heavenly kingdom and all people will see Him and have our sins judged by Him.  If all people do not accept Jesus Christ as our Savior Who died and resurrected from the dead to pay for our sins for us to reconcile us sinners with God, then OUR sins will remain with US at the final judgment and there is no other salvation for us.  Obey God, repent of sins and be spiritually born again, by honestly accepting Jesus Christ, God on earth, as your Savior Who was born one of us to die and resurrect from the dead to pay for our sins and defeat death for us, to reconcile us sinners with God, to give us eternal life with Him.

Dead Putin
Putin is a bully; I think USA,CHINA,UK N other powerful countries in EUROPE should attack him,  is he God? by invading and attacking a vulnerable country which pleads with him not to attack.He is really a bully

pov: the year is 2032 russia made a new atomic bomb. they drop it in a small village in ukraine but the death toll rises but then skrinkens. You see a bunch of Ukrainians walking towards you but something feels off. you focus on one of them and see their face half burnt off and their flesh falling off. They get closer you start sprinting away until you enter a small subway where you lock the door and hide in there for the time being
Damn...no one really give 2 shit about ukraine.  It's like russia is taking candy away from a little kid and everyone is just watching!
all them anti-gun ppls gonna die lol
Ghost of kyiv is a god
it was a small russian spetznaz group who captured few Ukrainian armored vehicles and entered Obolon. they all were shot in the morning so its old news. by the way one of them ran over civilian car with old man in it, thanks God civilian driver survived.
it`s 1 tank???
Bcoz of Western group,  you really know about that who they are !
We wanna bomb UK
Ukraine was abandoned by the world.
Great job Russia
It is such a shame that nobody learns from history, it's just like 1938 with Czechoslovakia. Don't they learn how bullies need to be dealt with? All they had to do is station a few lightly armored multi-national blue helmed peacekeeping divisions along the border and Putin would have never had the courage to touch them because bullies are always cowards, there are one and the same.
I miss Angela Merkels presence  .. where are the balls of leadership anymore ..  if this was maggies day (love or hate her) or Angela Merkels watch . Man  this world 🌎  is screwed if we keep voting in some of the worst  comic book characters to run it .

War is never a solution but circumstances were being built for Russia to take action. NATO wants to set up their Terrorism Industry every where,this time they failed.

I am having a wonderful day sitting here in my comfortable big chair with my feet up.  I am drinking grape soda (Shasta) and eating Cheetos.  I am watching the news from Ukraine and laughing out loud.  I find it funny and amusing because the Ukraine government really got themselves screwed over.  LOL!!!!!  They spent 12 years and over 80 million dollars bribing hunter biden and the big guy for protection from the United States……and all they got was a couple of meaningless sanctions from a demented senile old fool.  LOL!!!!!  Next time they should have bribed Putin!!!!!  Ha ha ha ha ha!!!!
How  much scared they are ...
Disgusting editing by the BBC. Why not show more comments from Sergay Lavrov's?
Like some guy from 1939..
Old men start wars ... young men fight them.
Good job.
Don't worry Johnson has put the Ukraine flag out, that will show them.
I have a lot of respect for Ukraines president now. In Afghanistan, their leader got up and left without a word in a helicopter to save his own life. Ukraines is staying with his people right in the capital without trying to save his own skin, but rather to provide morale for his people and give them hope that they haven't been abandoned. He is truly a stubborn, caring, courageous leader and I wish many countries leader had his strength
Hate putin
It's all played out. US will be involved just watch.
Where is Boris and Biden??? They encouraged  Ukraine, then walk away when they see trouble...bit like Afghanistan
Does Ukraine remind you of London in the blitz??
The russians have to get out of their tank eventually and when they do shoot them in the face

Bro I saw a video of a tank running over a car that was moving towards it shits crazy over there
Ukraine is a US vassal. That’s what happens when you bend over backwards for the scum of America. Ukraine had 8 years to avoid this. They deserve everything that’s coming their way. And America keep prodding the bear. You’re next. Everyone just magically avoids the question, what has the US done around the role and still doing around the world as we speak, killing,  bombing and regime changing numerous countries. Russia finally said no, not on my doorstep. You deserve all this. Go Russia. Go, these ignorant mindless cnn bbc news reading morons have no clue. Ukraine is full of US puppets and Nazis. Google is your friend. Wake the f up. Only one nation truley for the people. That’s Russia. Enough with America. That’s it. Done.
I honestly think Putin has just really badly been wanting to use his toys! By toys I mean tanks ships jets ect. Interested to see what the outcome will be for him.. Will it turn into a hilter hunt? Or will he come to his senses?
1 Corinthians 15:31-35 (KJV)  I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die. Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners. Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame. But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?
Horrible world
Nato Eu and USA are unsuccessful
IN 1994 the United Nations lead by America promised Ukraine protection of Russian invasion if it gave up it's Nukes and fast forward over 20 years and the UN and America are nothing but cowards to Putin .
What happened to we stand with Ukraine 🇺🇦 🤔 they should have said, we stand with Ukraine until Russia 🇷🇺 arrives with their ships, tanks and fighter jets.

I hope we remember this when this is over. That no one was willing to put boots on the ground to stop a fascist dictatorship from attacking Europe, again. When they asked for our help, we ignored them.
Ukraine should nuke putin
Dear friends! Hard times have come to Ukraine. It is no secret that our brave warriors, our brothers, husbands and fathers, are defending us from the Russian threat right now. Unfortunately, civilians, our women and children, also got under attack and already suffered casualties... We are a volunteer organization, our primary task is to evacuate citizens from battlefields. We try to help everyone, but more and more people become afraid for their lives and their future. So if you are not indifferent to the fate of millions of Ukrainians, we ask you to help to protect our women and children! Say "No!" to war, any little help can save someone's life!  Our Bitcoin Wallet: bc1qg0zwkh7msvqd2845t2vuyj3cw266w94gxmf6g4 Spread the word!
How horribly helpless they must feel. Immasculating to watch tanks roll into your city unchallenged like that
Where is the Ukrainian army when Russian armour is doing recky petrols round the outer perimeter of the city?
Biden nothing infront of Putin.
"Si vis pacem,para bellum/If you want peace, prepare for war."  Old Latin proverb.
BBC fake news.
I want to know is this terrorism ? Or do they have to be Muslims ?
The West should have supplied Ukraine with useful weapons like the CBU-105. The could incinerate all those tanks and APCs and the Ivans inside. Such an outcome could have led to Putins overthrow. What NATO have done is feeble. Sanction will make no difference. The EU, US and NATO have watched while 40 million democratic citizens are ensalved.
So if you want to join NATO just make sure your next door neighbor agrees about it, NATO are you effing kidding me, you havent done anything to help ukraine or deter this invasion you had easy 4 months since they started building up troops
Hang the politicians first. Liz Truss? Well what did you expect? The British Govt. has got exactly what it wanted......why pretend it wanted anything else? Russia has a right to enforce its borders, just like the US defended its borders 20 years ago. The thing is.....Ukraine is next to Russia.....can't really say the same about Iraq now, can we?
Where's the Rambo ?
I am from Tennessee and we have great people here. There are no doubt great people in Ukraine who are struggling. Sending love from Tennessee

America done this job the want Ukrain and Russia fight and the enjoy the war on tv ,people foul where America there is fight America is a devil'

The US dragged ukraine into war and set a side to enjoy the war theatre.
They need to set up on those roofs and shoot those tanks with Javelins.
Lol Russia won in one day.
Putin is a bad human
If you are reading this I want you to know that none of us can live up to God’s, and even our own, moral standards. The good news is that God knew this and he knew that he had to meet the standards for us. This is why God loved us so much that he put on human flesh and came into our world and lived the perfect life that we know that we couldn’t live. So that way our salvation would be judged by the life that he lived rather than the life we lived. Even more, he offers that life to us as a free gift. All we have to do is accept it.
Pray for Ukraine.. world should talk Putin. UN SHOULD TALK N WARN PUTIN..what the Ukraine government.. they are weak like Afghanistan government..
The USA is the problem in Ukraine stop antagonizing Russia. Russia is not Libya. Russia have the right to defend itself
Ukrainian capital conquered in two days. Well done Russia! 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Man the narratives are stupidly biased.
Ghost of Kyiv goin crazy rn
Fake News BBC lying again… it’s a Ukrainian tank… Russian tanks have a white Z painted on them… every one knows that… except, it seems the BBC..😂😂
Wheres the Ukrainian army?
America n UK where?? Hahaha
Do you understand that Ukraine is suffering heavy losses?  children, civilians were killed, now civilians are being bombed in Kharkov, Kiev, Kherson, full of videos !!!  tomorrow Putin will go to Kazakhstan, the Baltic states, Poland, Europe, why didn't you help Ukraine earlier?  Ukraine, Kazakhstan need nuclear missiles, the people want to remove Tokaev's tyrant, Putin's puppet. If these countries had nuclear missiles, then Putin would not go to war out of fear, there would be no war, no sacrifice, everyone would economically trade with Europe and America.
The odd thing is that NATO, UN, USA or Britain and others who are talking about Ukraine and saving them are infact not helping Ukraine at all with their forces, even though Ukraine asked for help.
people don’t understand the USA crated this and the uk because where are they now to help they actually lied to Ukraine because if they talk like they are so close where are they they made sure no nato was there and delayed Ukraine joining nato so they the USA and Uk don’t go to war it’s funny how the USA and uk pick on weak country’s like Iraq when they never had any nuclear weapons and they had sadamm killed the USA and uk people are cowards and slaves it’s a fact when has the uk ever had a civil war never because they fear a weak government
Mr. Putin the mad psychopath should be responsible for the unethical, shameful, and barbaric attack on 🇺🇦 Ukraine 🇺🇦 which is an independent and sovereign country. If US and NATO retaliate with military response Putin will face horrible defeat, but as a mad dictator, he will potentially try to nuke the entire world. Then the Earth will be a dead planet. West has to act wisely and deal with this situation with many precautions. We salute the brave and strong peoples of 🇺🇦 Ukraine🇺🇦 pray for them.
I hope that ukraine is safe... but if they were to surrender, that's basically just making them a pushover and the russians will feel like they can control them and make threats if they don't listen. Russia have been known for their threats if they don't have their own way, abit over 8 months ago United Kingdom passed through the Ukrainian waters which is completely fine with them as we have a good strong relationship with ukraine. But the russians had spotted the uk and started following the 1 ship, but the russians ended up having about 2 ships 2 jets and 2 helicopters shadowing the uk when they were passing through Ukrainian waters so had nothing to do with Russia it wasn't threatening. But Russia ended up telling the British to turn around and go back and basically get out of the waters or there would be repercussions. So the uk got armoured up and the next minute russia had fired warning shots at them to turn away. Its disgusting, it's like they want to take over the world, they want to control everyone and tell them what to do and bully them! The uk had stood their ground and they didn't turn around because they weren't a threat at all and they weren't even in Russian waters and they weren't heading that way!
Hey PUTIN.. Make sure you have 10% to big guy. He’s in a bunker now
ukriane should not have given up their nuclear weapons... periods... thats how you survive today from war, no other way..
It wouldn't have been a problem if Ukrainian government haven't sided with USA
The problem is not this war my friends, it's this crazy desire for patriotism and fleeing the Union and trying to become the strongest alone, Russia and other countries in the world shouldn't exist anymore, to evolve we must join our minds and our hands as one ,one people one single nation one single flag, abandon patriotism and unite so we never see a war like this happen again so that humanity will not be afraid of each other anymore
Sad situation… Russia shall be condemned to highest level… Back off.. still there is time.. And about America once again proved that America is big bully, when it comes to smaller country in few hours they sent thier invasion armies but when it comes to stand against china or russia they always runaway… very weak approach..
How about show the video of the Russian tank deliberately riding over a civilians car.
seems Russians are getting their ass kicked by what im hearing on the media.
The groundwork for this invasion was laid when NATO moved east and added former Warsaw Pact countries in Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary after the fall of the Soviet Union. Russia was no longer as big of a threat but NATO couldn't wait to acquire new members then attack Serbia, a close ally of the USSR.
Despicable comment by Lavrov in relation to the plight of civilians caught in the cross hairs. They should have thought about it in 2008...-??? What would they do? Claim pre emotive refugee status? Asylum? Just leave? USSR of course, did that before with Ukraine- removing indigenous people to replace them with Russians who had never lived there. People complain about Soros... Lavrov - you are a lousy negotiator.
Take it all Putin! f joe biden!
People of Romania are on  the Ukrainian side. Hope freedom will win!
It's not a war between Russia and Ukraine It's a war between Russia and US , NATO and West who butchered millions of people....now its their turn
Why NATO dont nuke russia? We dont need Russia on this planet

One heard very little from the BBC when British soldiers in Iraq or Afghanistan killed everything that came in front of their shotgun. One can almost get the impression that you want to justify your own actions with your hate speech against Russia.
More British propaganda bullshi*?
Mad man...
Putin's actions are unmoral. That man is a cold blooded murderer. Ukraine just wanted to live peacful life and it's citizens are one of the best and most honest people I have ever met. Their lives are now at stake because of some dictator and his crazy vision of reuniting the Soviet Union. Putin does not belong to 21st century...
The people of Ukraine shouldn't have to suffer at the hands of this bully ,but the Ukraine must stay strong and fight on the Ukrainian people will be atrong togetherness
I think  China will try to take over Taiwan next an USA will just sit back and watch
No country can match the Power of Russia. Nor any leader. West and NATO are bunch of fools.
Too damm bad Ukraine didn’t have a few nukes as a deterrent!  Too bad they didn’t turn Moscow to glass. As a deterrent to others in the future. All the lawlessness in the world is a mirror image of the worlds leaders. At this point why have laws at all if they only protect the criminals and enrich politicians. Soon everyone  will wear a gun and the world will become a polite place.
When Putin says "no" to Ukraine joining NATO and bringing in NATO base, He means no lol

Putin is doing what most nations leaders are too scared to do, and that is resisting the attempts to impose American hegemony. Ideally, it is necessary to liberate Ukraine, clear it of Nazis, as well as pro-Nazi people and ideology.
they are running cars with people in them with tanks
We shall see what will you say in 2 weeks. brainwashed clowns in the comments
Go russia
Ukraine its just as corrupt as Russia and the USA just let them do whatever.. They didn't get involved when we bombed half of middle East based on the same things Russia are invading Ukraine for ppl need to do some. Fuckin research
Good work putin
THOSE ARE UKRAINIAN TANKS  Russian tanks have a white "Z"  painted all over them. Stands for "operation Z" Russian troops wear white arm bands as well. Those are Ukrainian tanks most likely setting up for the invasion, because they have no markers that would indicate them being Russian. Russian tanks and infantry have these markers in order to distinguish themselves.
Russia will never invade Ukraine.
This is an evidence of international military crime!
Shame on you russia. Putin is the new Hitler!
Ukraine needs loads of anti tank missiles and portable air defense. Just hand in to every soldier and Russian tanks Will be all taken out
In a dystopian sign of our social credit score future, four million French people woke up to discover their vaccine passport had suddenly expired because they hadn’t got the latest booster shot.  Yes, really.  France 24 reports on an 18-year-old student who “headed straight for the vaccination center” after she “woke up to an expired vaccine pass after not getting a booster shot in time.”  The student complained about there being “too many rules” and the length of time before people had to get a booster being shortened from 6 to 3 months, but she went ahead and rolled up her sleeve anyway.  Another young woman interviewed by the news channel who chose not to get a booster shot said, “I don’t have the right to do anything anymore, so I’m not even trying, I hope the pass is suspended soon.”

If only people around the world concern Palestinian people like how they concern Ukrainian, it's very sad when people just ignore what USA did to Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, but when Ukraine getting attack, people suddenly care, what a world I live in,

The small region contested should have already been given to Russia. Not that Ukraine is capitulating to tyranny, and this would be the line in the sand. This did not have to happen.  The contested area is not worth the brave but prideful Ukraine military and citizenry being killed. It isn't surrendering or giving in. It is common sense.

Those 'tanks' appear to be Ukrainian. All Russian military vehicles have prominent markings on them ('Z' or 'O').
If kiev falls tonight
President Zelensky didn’t believe the US about an imminent invasion. Now he’s asking for our help. Am I missing something?
Putin is the only rational voice in the world today. Very intelligent man.  Stopping a genocide in Donbass .  He has a sharp mind and a kind heart.
Russia will pay for this - the country is done now
The people of Ukraine do NOT want this war.  The people of Russia do NOT want this war.  One man wants this war. That is what we call evil.
Sorry, citizens Ukrainians, but it is very necessary for the president Biden that Russia got bogged down in war with the Ukrainian Nazis, and he could finish with China. Your comedian Zelinsky did not even know that he set fire.  Ukrainians and Russians it is the same people. Just Ukraine was taken by pro-NATO puppets and tried to sic Russians on Russians. There is no democracy in NATO. There is only the American military industrial complex. In NATO there is no free press, only a lie, a lie, a lie, a lie
Terrifying!!! What is Putin's aim? Does he want Ukraine to refuse the idea of entering NATO? Or what? On what conditions will he stop this madness?
The Russian people need to stand up and stop their dictator. Putin is sending Russian sons, fathers, and brothers to their deaths for no reason. And is overseeing the murder of Ukrainain people who are like brothers to Russians. This is pointless.
Owen Shroyer hosts this LIVE edition of War Room, weekdays 3-6 p.m. C
That's what you get for being NATO's pet. Ukraine was supposed to be a bridge between the West and Russia. I am against the war, the Russian invasion, and the ignorant Ukrainian president who let his own people get caught in the crossfire.
Putin should be arrested for war crimes should he ever leave Russia.
One week i predict
Very sad why haven't Ukraine got tanks I'm in England,and I think it's discusting what Putin is doing .we are watching and I will pray for you all .
Every Russian soldier that gets captured or surrender has to have his arms chopped off and sent back to Russia .
Now the time has come! Putin is fooling the West by his own greedy nose! The West is too greedy to take proper action against Putin! It's a shame! An absolute shame! I am deeply ashamed to be a part of the West again after the departure from Afghanistan! My sympathy goes out to everyone who believes in justice, freedom and democracy! To all who are fed up with capitalism driven by greed and ruthlessness! And my special sympathy goes to the Ukrainian people! The West, driven by greed, is losing its freedom at this moment! I just can't believe we're just watching! That we didn't act after the Crimean invasion! No! Greed got in the way! And now that it matters and everyone has made big cheeks like our damn federal government! After the announced diplomatic and economic nuclear bombs, only a mild breeze! I am stunned and immensely disappointed by this federal government and the entire West! I believe that the West has put capital first! Freedom, democracy and justice are far subordinate to this! We have long since sold our values, our ideals, our soul and thus lost it!!!

We told you this was coming, tune in NOW to find out what happens next! Watch & share this bombshell broadcast globalists DO NOT want you to see!
Just a first wave and they have already got the capital
It's a lie he said that civilians aren't safe how would they be safe when you make them take up arms . 18 to 60 year olds . If I was there I wouldn't be going out to fight a superpower fuck that.
Russia is not making any sense. They don't want Ukraine to have their own autonomy. Also don't they have the autonomy as a country to choose their destiny or future, join or not join NATO. I know that in Russia's eyes it would seem that strategically NATO being on their doorstep is not good, but if Russia wants to play on the world's stage and be an active and contributing member - then why does it matter? If NATO is not your enemy, why do this?
ukraine will fall to russia, i hope they reach the settlement with each other and alteast fighting stops.. war is destroying homes, so much infrastructure and especially killing so many innocents...
Sleepy joe is sleeping as Russia challenge America
Ukraine should immediately become a NATO member. Then NATO should act accordingly.
I'm from Russia. I wish Ukrainians  to survive this and become stronger! I visited Ukraine several times and remember its kind and talented people!
Lies lies lies. Those are Ukrainian tanks !!
this is new nazi russia.  we were telling you for some time . u did nothing for us ot to prepare even for yourselves
THIS IS A TRAVESTY OF INDEPENDENCE FOR UKRAINE AND PUTIN IS NO BETTER THAN STALIN WHOM MURDERED HIS OWN PEOPLE FOR POWER AND PUTIN HAS STILL A SOVIET KGB MENTALITY AND WANTS TO RECLAIM THE IRON CURTAIN THERE WILL BE ALOT MORE PROBLEMS TO COME AND WATCH CHINA ATTACHED TAIWAN NOW THAT IT'S BUDDIES WITH PUTIN AND IF HE GOT AWAY WITH UKRAINE CHINA WILL BE EMBOLDENED BY THIS , GOD BLESS UKRAINE AND IT'S PEOPLE 😞😞🙏🙏
Tank running over a car and back again discusting ,I do not like Putin now
1. Where is the Ukrainian army? 2. Why are civilians not allowed out of the country? 3. Why doesn't the government capitulate?  The West did the same with the Hungarians in 1956. They promised all they gave nothing.  With the big difference that the Hungarians never persecuted the Polish-Russian minority, etc ...
The yellow bus driver didn’t want to miss a day at work.
Comments mean nothing during a war .
The Ukrainian military is firing indiscriminately into their own civilian areas as well as the civilian areas of the DPR start paying attention people that apartment housing block was not destroyed by Russians firing on the building it was destroyed by the Ukrainian military shooting missiles down that ended up blowing the buildings up listen to what the reporter said pull your head out of your ass people
And Boris Johnson was clearly seeking war and provocation toward Russia. May British people wake up !
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGDpo81qC5E
if u realy think a russian tank travels alone in kyiv u are retarded
Total sanctions on Russia now.
No more Appeasement 😡  Need Actions Not Sanctions  You can’t reason with Tiger when your head is in his mouth
Be careful of BBC they have a political bias
Fight back Europe, this is bullshit
Let them go retarded once there done I hope they feel very good about them self and get hunted by the ones that got killed for no stupid reason
Russia will be humiliated similar to Afghanistan in a couple years
PUTIN IS THE SHAME OF RUSSIANS FOREVER. HITTLER. MURDERER OF CHILDREN .
Adolf Zelensky is hiding in Rothschild's toilet.
May Almighty YAHWEH watch over the good people of Ukraine..
Cold beer in the Friday Night! 🎶🎵
NATO should down arms.
Why dont they have bucket loads of anti tank weapons. Anti aircraft on all roofs
Marshall law has to be super scary for these people.
This getting boring now
Only need 2 days to take Ukraine capital... 😱😱😱
this is a ukranian tank
Why do the tanks have to drive on the grass!!!
That fast already
Not even a week and Russia already at Kiev. That was quick. Russia should take over others Non-NATO countries.
DON'T TRUST BBC AND OTHER WESTERN AND AMERICAN MEDIA! IT'S A INFORMATIONAL WAR!!! PEOPLE DON'T BE SO NARROW-MINDED!!!!
Zelensky, go away, give up! The West deceived you, betrayed you. Do not use your peaceful people as meat. Rise up and save the civilians.
The Jew Zelensky crossed the red line.  He began to threaten Putin with a nuclear club.
Why can’t she say Kiev
We must unite as a world to defeat the Russian menace
Democracy my arse men having to stay and fight a none winning war for Ukraine . They'd have more freedom living with russian rule . I'm Irish and I'm not one bit free in my country they have new laws every day to make criminals out of us all they take 65% on taxes or more for fuel food is crazy prices to and the cost of living on this wet hole of a country is worse than Monaco at least they have the wealth and billionaires there we got spuds cabbage cows an sheep as our Welt and what every resources we have we give it away to the rest of Europe and buy it back off of them fuck sake we can't even metal detect here or look for treasures all we get from our government is we owe the European community money's from loans to use to build roads and bullshite our public transport is rubbish . Shame Russia didn't land here last month might pull us out of communist Ireland 🤣😂
Men 18-60 are bared from leaving to avoid the invasion men sacrifice soo much and yet in America feminism is diluting that sacrifice
you need to learn how a tank looks
TOTAL FAKE!!! SHAME ON BBC! There is no Z letter and it's an old type Ukrainian military vehicle in the beginning.
"Putin is a smart man" - this said as Putin drives his countries economy into the toilet to wreck another country which he intends to occupy, which will be extremely expensive. Putin is not smart.
Wtf nato doing really??
Taiwan will be the next if NATO do not stop Putin
And we believe anything coming from the  BBC. Lol
It is sad that no one went to support Ukraine.I hope future leaders understand what is the meaning of standing alone.
Damn GG already that's how powerful Russia is. Nato can't do shit to Russia that's how useless nato is and can only sanction them.
2 lightly armored vehicules, unescorted, are driving around the capital city of the country of 45 milion people. Without any opposition.  Putin placed 100k soldiers near the borders with Ukraine prior to « the invasion ». Those number are way to low to invade the country of that size.  Dont know what but something strange is happening there. If putin used this amount of ressources against, lets say, Serbia i would not even worry. Even A country like Switzerland would have crushed Ukraine.
ВСУ по дворам прячутся
Russian f*ck usa f *ck europa f*ck china f*ck NATO f*ck
Shame on NATO countries for their response. They sent armies to Afghanistan even when there was no real threat to Europe from Afghans but they are afraid to fight with Russia which is a real threat
Russians are equally responsible….NOT ONLY PUTIN
China: If NATO really does nothing to Russia, prepare an invasion of Taiwan.
Prayers going up 🙏🙏
Joe Biden is being cucked by Putin
Fake news
this is ukranian tank
Why doesn't Ukraine have enough shoulder fired missiles to take out  All of Russia's hardware?
The guy they have subbing the Russian sounds like Squidward.
Can someone help me understand? I thought Ukraine had a population of 44 million and a army of 250,000? How can, Russia gain access to the capital so fast? Sounds to me they gave up from the start?
"Russian tanks filmed - entering Ukraine's capital Kyiv with BBC News"
Seeing the comments made me realize that you shouldn’t read the comments.   If you see this get out while you can. Cause all of a sudden people are “experts” on any topic they are arguing about while only providing surface level “facts” at best to prove their points, you can find the info literally anywhere from a simple search. Y’all aren’t experts, stop acting like it. The actual experts are shitting their pants rn deciding what the hell to do. Not pointlessly arguing on a YouTube comment section lmfao.   Jesus Christ, have I lost faith in humanity. Especially to the comments defending Russia and calling Nato of all things nazism. Also “praying” doesn’t do shit to help.   Don’t get me wrong I’m not trying to put myself as an “intellectual”. I’m just someone who’s sick and tired of it all.
this wasnt a russian tank... theres a video of the russian tanks coming across Ukrainian border all with light camo and the model they brought didnt have any weapons attached... the tank in this image has dark camo and anti air attached...
Do not place a fake ! Here is Ukranian armored vehicle.
PUTIN keeps increasing his blood tank of people he has murdered with zero fvcks given.   The only people that can take him out are Russians themselves, not even the entire NATO can stop the "Bloody Russian Emperor".....  He can't wait to press that NUKE button and turn Europe to ashes.
Human beings  are stupid, stupid, stupid!
Please discuss Tony Blair and NATo mistakes and apologizing,  stupid liberators
Those look more like mortar carriers and infantry APCs (also saw what seems to be a TOS-Buratino thermobaric missile carrier) , even then it doesn't take away from how horrifying situation this is, respect to Zelensky for not abandoning his people in their time of need.
Does Ukraine not have an army, where are they hiding ?
Hope all Palestinian, Syrian, Afghanis, Iraqis, Libyans, Yemenis citizens are safe after the invasions of USA and it’s Allies.
Also other countries should apply now to get into NATO. That should help Russia understand they f’d up
Zelinsky is brave
Cancel russia 😂😂😂😂
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
This is what Putin believes about the West ...?    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNFDbx-nJNI
Reminds me of Hungary 1956.  No one came to help them either from the Russians.   Just talk.
What is life of a human being?
Z
Soon coming to every former East Block country, Baltic countries first. RasPutin has lost his mind after 22 years in power.
Were is united nation??
Europe, stand up from the toilet seat and go help Ukraine!!  🇺🇦 🇬🇪
🇷🇺
Ukraine is a sovereign nation, they can join whatever the hell they feel like.
Thank Biden for supporting Russia with oil money, and China with made in China money. Government regulations and policy are aiding communist countries.
They only going to charge the government in Ukraine.
Ukraine need help from other counrty....
if anyone actually believes anything the bbc publish your stupid.  biggest liars and misinformation clowns ever
It's not iraq or afgaistan.  It's Russia. Do you understand america and nato?
I pray for civilian in ukrain!!
Bu adam ölürse suçlusu  susan devletlerdir büyük değilsiniz müdahale etmiyorsunuz. Tüm katliamlarda sustuğunuz gibi  Ukranya korkma
Never ever trust BBC news
Putin is a bully, sticks his nose where a dog wouldn't stick it's tail! Power hungry LOSER!
They surrounding them . This is not a “ War “ . They’re going to topple Sylvenski and make the land theirs without destroying it
I can't imagine this is happening in 21st century...so sad
Putin IS doing right IS all americans fault
May all of those tanks and all the soldiers and all the Russians who support Adolf Putin burn alive in hell
Do you think a lone Russian tank commander would drive through the capital when the Ukraine's have been armed with javelin anti tank missiles that would blow it to pieces? It might be Ukrainian they both have the same tanks etc!
“Those who love peace must learn to organize as effectively as those who love war.” ― Martin Luther King Jr.
We need Trump
Russian President addressed to the official Ukrainian Army forces offering them to get rid of fascists in power and their drug addicted president and take the power over the country into their hands.
They are just doing what the alliance did in 2003 in Iraq,    there is no morals anymore
We need Trump
People should stay a fight for their country.
🙏🏻🥲
bs
where is Superman, Batman, Spiderman etc in this time
_'AT LEAST BIDEN TWEETS NICE!!'_   👉😣👈
Would you please show the British tanks riding over civillians in Iraq😂😂😂
Ukraine should also just say fuck it and invade Russia
Russia Has To Remove The Chemical Weapon From Ukraine
min: 0:25 Not Russian Tank. Ukraine´s Strella-10 or SA-13 Gopher
This is the consequency of trusting West and put your own country fate in the hands of Western politicians! Such incompetent Ukraine president brings entire country into jeapody! Sadly they never learn.
Fake news
holy sh... how is your look? its terrible... what happened? you came from ukraine? or you catched a russian rocket by your face?  pls. go to hospital,to fix it...
The foult is in US and the nazis..
Слава России 💪🏽
if its on the beeb it must be true...LOL
God bless russia!
How about yemen' Syria ' iraq' those aren't human ig.
Not a Russian tank, but a Ukrainian anti-aircraft gun evades a retaliatory strike. And the explosion in the sky is tonight the Ukrainians shot down their SU-27 by mistake. The US and your media is an empire of lies.
Russia Has The Right To Defend Itself
It's so sad to think that there's probably 0 chance of any country helping Ukraine, because the risk of world war III/nuclear war is high, i pray for Ukrainian's that they can safely seek shelter.. and everyone gets the chance to evacuate, in a time of war the counties people have no power to stop it, the only thing you can do is to rely on your government, and pray that this war will disappear with the power of negotiation and not escalate to millions of bloodshed...
War = Only cowards make war. If Putin and Biden want to make war go and fight with each other! Two globalists-freemasons who support poisoned vaccines as well! F*ck you! This is a fake war! This is about genocide against humanity. If you want REAL peace eliminate all freemasons-globalists worldwide!
У Путина капут от Бога! Russian troops one day turn to труп-s!
Англасаксы пошли вон с нашей земли !Надеюсь вы услышали Путина!
The world is always in a chaotic mess. Blaming their rotting mess and feelings to other countries. 😊 🇮🇱 I 🇮🇱 AM🇮🇱 ISRAEL🇮🇱
Now Russia is in control, this would be street and house to house fighting, If Ukraine leadership is wise enough  he will surrender to avoid more damage and killing. is not a cowardly acts at this point.
PUTİN İngiltere ve Almanya yı da istila et, londrayı ve berlin i ateşe ver 😉😂💪🇷🇺🇹🇷
Today, Ukrainians are fighting for our Polish, German, French-European and maybe a WORLD FREEDOM, INDEPENDENCE, DEMOCRACY AND SECURITY. The price is blood and life, men, women and children! In europarlament they shout "THE RULE OF LAW" and cut subsidies for Poland, impose fines. When a criminal is killed in Ukraine people, you defend him and your money, you shout "Opposition to Russia being cut off from SWIFT." How much does human life mean to you? How many more men, women and children have to die for Germany to recognize that now it is already illegal and it pays to cut off Russia from SWIFT? What has changed in you since World War II? What does "never again" mean to you ...?  Heute kämpfen die Ukrainer für unsere polnische, deutsche, französische – europäische FREIHEIT, UNABHÄNGIGKEIT, DEMOKRATIE UND SICHERHEIT. Blut und Leben sind ein Preis für Männer, Frauen und Kinder! Sie verteidigen ihn und Ihr Geld, Sie rufen „Opposition gegen die Ausgrenzung von SWIFT in Russland!" Wie viele Männer, Frauen und Kinder müssen noch sterben, damit Deutschland erkennt, dass es jetzt schon illegal ist und es sich lohnt, Russland von SWIFT abzuschneiden? Was hat sich in Ihnen seit dem Zweiten Weltkrieg verändert? Was bedeutet "nie wieder" für Sie ...?  Dziś Ukraińcy walczą o naszą, polską, niemiecką, francusko – europejską WOLNOŚĆ, NIEPODLEGŁOŚĆ, DEMOKRACJĘ I BEZPIECZEŃSTWO. Ceną jest krew i życie, mężczyzn, kobiet i dzieci!Krzyczą „PRAWORZĄDNOŚĆ” i obcinają dotacje dla Polski, nakładają grzywny. Kiedy przestępca zabijana na Ukrainie ludzi, bronicie go i swoich pieniędzy, krzyczycie „Sprzeciw wobec odcięcia Rosji od SWIFT”.Ile dla Was znaczy ludzkie życie? Ile jeszcze mężczyzn, kobiet i dzieci musi zginąć, aby Niemcy uznały, że teraz, to już jest niepraworządne i opłaca się wam odciąć rosję od SWIFT? Co się w Was zmieniło od II wojny światowej? Co znaczy dla Was "nigdy więcej"...?
So much bullshit. They're not going to send just 2 vehicles. This is a setup
Any Ukrainian can tell us what is happening with Ukrainian Army ? i heard you guys got 250 000 Troops, aint some of that stationed in Kyiv? Smash the russians entering your country
People, this is fake! Russians don’t have tanks in Kiev!!! It’s either tanks of local neo-nazis/Bendera soldiers or some old footage! Same in Kharkov, if you hear news about it! Just think about it - if Russia has destroyed military objects and airports, why enter on tanks?!? Makes no sense at all!!!
At least Putin ended the pandemic.
Show the video where the Russian tank rolls over a moving civilian vehicle 🤷🏼‍♂️
Tired of this bullshit. Filming but no defense and watch innocent get invaded. Fuk outta here
Bojo, are you ready die for U-craine (whah your "craine" look like?")
Ukraine missed a Golding opportunity to gain their severity and independent. they never tried to make peace with their neighbor Russia. on the contrary they always try to threating Russia with NATO. they are idiots don't know what's good for them.
We spend billions $$ and years of hard labor training Ukrainian Army , and they get smashed in one day.  This is as bad as Afghanistan, what happened to all javelins and stingers? I hope they didn’t get sold to ISIS , that’s really bad news .
Ukraine: Hey, NATO, just to check, you still want me in right?
I cried when I saw an image of a little girl on a bike killed by the russian attack… so sad
All it takes is one vehicle to take a major city? Yikes
I am actually getting really scared, R.I.P to all the soldiers that have already died we love you. 💗
The all thanks to the USA
Imagine this was UK and Boris offered citizens a weapon ,barring men 18 - 60 years of age leaving UK .As soon Bumling Buffoon tried old For Queen & Country many would say NO THANKS TAKE WEAPON BACK Protect my own with baseball bat & pile of bricks but shower call themselves Monarchs are on there own as would be Boris ,Nicola & rest lying pieces off shit .Our Grandparents fought WW2 & believed call for King & Country they defeated Nazi Germany & got what ? Germany rebuilt into better country than UK .I still believe Monarchy had hedged their bets no matter Nazis win would still live privileged life in their Palaces .Let's not pretend it's about saving the Nation it's about protecting same Politicians that screw you .Their families would be flown to pre arranged destinations along with corrupt wealth whilst your  family were mere cannon fodder I'm sorry call me traitor I couldn't care less Politicians who create Wars 99.9% never experienced Tulsi Gabbard a politician that actually fought as Patriot is Anti-War having saw horrors ,a BULLSHIT war our elected Leaders lied us into (not one has faced war crimes or crimes against own people) Putin you could see fighting but Biden ,Boris GTFOH  Trump I could see throw couple rocks then trip Melania up as Shoot & Scoot smoke & flames bellowing from Flat Feet got his ass out Vietnam War. Hey look President Flat Feet ain't missed a beat Tweet & Go leaving Melania his Hoe to face Putin friend & foe ,typical President Biden a no show The basement he went down to hide with Hunter his son a total clown
Wierd how Russia targeted US biological labs in Ukraine and no one says a word
I honestly hate Russia so much for doing this.
Where is nato now where is boris now??!!!!!!
I don't think it well end in Ukraine
Putin is a modern Hitler and has made a bad mistake.
If I read 1 more effin comment like this - "those poor people, my heart goes out to them. I'm praying for the dogs and cats and animals as well. Stay safe Ukraine. Putin bites the heads off children for breakfast"......and so on. And that's just Kay effin Burley of Sky News. You want the truth? Ukraine is a cesspool of high level corruption, money laundering for the elites and biological warfare research. The Biden's have made millions in Ukraine with their corrupt contacts and are up to their necks in the sewage of Ukraine. NATO has been installing new tech missiles in Ukraine and on the Russian border! Putin, as President of Russia, is doing his job! Protecting Russians. There are 11 biological warfare research lab's in the Ukraine. So far, Russia has taken out 7 of them, I think. What were they doing? Think about what will happen if they launch a real virus on the planet, not a flu derivative that never killed anyone that wasn't about to die anyway. Wakey wakey ppl.
🙏🙏🙏😥😥prayers for Ukrainian people's
Poor Ukraine... I feel sad for then but I beleive they have already lost
“Monkey killing monkey killing monkey over pieces of the ground. Give them thumbs they make a club to beat their brother down” right in two by Tool. Such a fitting song right now
give them hell ukraine, They arent going to stop until your country is smashed into the ground. Might as well die fighting then die lying down in the dirt. If it was up to me the US military would already be defending her ally, no matter the cost. Americans should be dying with Ukrainians right now.
The U.S needs to step in and push Russia out.
they need weapons!
Ukraine should have given Single shot anti tank missiles to every possible Ukranians, as they are the most lethal weapon against armoured platforms in an urban environment.
what was kyiv regime expecting after 8 years of bombing donbass and killing 14 thousands of people? donuts?
In the meanwhile Lavov are you going to attack Finland for being in the NATO meeting today, with Sweden another who is revisiting the idea of full NATO membership
It is clear that the EU and NATO have not given enough support to Ukraine. They have left Ukraine alone in the war. May God protect the Ukrainian people.
Where is American promises to Ukrainian? Why is Ukraine president calling for dialogue? Is Sanctions not working for Europeans countries to Russians?
Unbelievable! Millions dying from Covid wasn’t enough huh?? Humans are disgusting 🤮
This or WW3, hmmmm?
Almost as if it was originally theirs..hmm
Putin and whoever lead to this disaster shall suffer the extreme pain in hell.
Not Russia Tank. Ukrainian tank
don’t talk about things you don’t understand, I’m not supporting anyone when it comes to war but the fact is, Putin tried to avoid this since 2014 but NATO does not listen and it keeps expanding East. He wanted to negotiate but they don’t listen so  war is the only answer left. The US and Europe are the aggressors here but because we’re watching western media, they will lie to you in saying the opposite.
nice
Also ukranian soldiers need to stop wearing uniforms.dress in civilian clothing and conduct operations wearing russian uniform they need to fear everyone including themselves
Ratio
Given the amount of social media...there is limited footage or on the ground reporters?
Lol there is no Z mark and that is Strela 10 anti air defense, old soviet made, of course Ukraine also has that. Doesnt make sense Russian will be lonewolf in the Kiev and there is no atgm in Kiev??? Propaganda
Yea right Ukraine aint shoot shit down!!!
The only way to solve this bad situation is to sell Ukraine president to Russia. That could save many lives in Ukraine. Don't let politic people abuse you until you civilian being war victim.   This way will works perfectly according to my analysis.
Hypocrite BBC
Don’t they have Azov SS division , it’s all over the internet how tough they’re ,  McCain before he died he had a nice powwow with them ,  armed them to the teeth,  where are they?  I hope they didn’t run away .
Say it with us Fuck Russia for invading a beautiful country Fuck EU for being a coward Fuck America for not acting soon enough
It’s not a full Lavrov‘s speech. You don’t see all situation. Only a words and pray. But no one country cen help to 10000 peoples from Donbas for 8 years.Look at your government and your problems..
This is not Russian tank it does not have this big white "Z". UA keep shelling civilians in donbass but media turns blind eye
Worst jio
Remmember Serbia, u idiots! U wanted international haos and dissrispect of UN resolutions, now seat and watch. U will do nothing! Mother Russia is born again. 1 country against ,NATO, so called friends .... protect Ukraine if u can western super powers!!!!!! P.S i hope that u understand that this is 0.7 % of russian weapon and military force ... for western "democrats" will be a little 2 eyes for crying
Think about this world, over 1,000,000 ethnic Ukrainians work in Russia. Question? Why Russia is not interning them as the Anglo-Americans interned the Japanese-Americans (legal American citizens) during WWII against Japan?
Russia waited too long for this action. if they done it long time ago before Ukraine gets organized and get more weapons the casualties would be less.
I remember when Britain rolled into Iraq.....Libya .....Falklands
Ukrain is betrayed, it’s obvious. Country of 40 million could list Up to 1 million soldierrs, look what  Croatia did in 90’s … the whole country is colapsing and they halve balls to send people with molotovk against russian tanks. This is a disgrase.  IT is better to capitulate to Russians, atleast war would be over and human lifes spared.
Russian Red Army are the new Nazis. Everyone hates them. Putin is a corrupt gangster. Hope his people see sense and string him up.
It was a Ukrainian plane!
EUR / World leaders! Don't be pussy like during WW2 when Poland was invaded by Hitler. You can still vanish yourself!. Please remember - history won't forgive you being passive again like was not forgotten till now for passive approach after Hitler's invasion on Poland.
US and the West are lying to support Ukraine. Now they fight Russia alone.
Anonymous should replace Russian Media with videos of the Ukrainian people and the war happening there. Maybe do a video with hidden suggestions that Putin is POS
The results of Euro-Atlantic humanity can now be seen in Ukraine as well. As seen in Serbia, and in Libya and throughout the Middle East. Wherever NATO benefactors came for peace, chaos ensued.
I have Ukraine girlfriend and her families there i hope they all will be ok i pray all time
The number of brainwashed slobs blaming Ukraine, NATO and the US is sickening. Yet, they cannot give one concrete example to justify what Putin is doing. The slobs are simply reposting misinformation and lies from other sources.  Although many people posting comments in favor of Putin are Russian trolls, the-others-are-simply-id!0ts!   Putin claimed in an interview yesterday that "we are defending ourselves". Against who?! Putin is a psychotic, murderous dictator.  This is all about Putin not wanting Ukraine to join NATO.
World war 3 is coming don't worry Fuck on Biden adminstration  No help when Afghanistan needs and so nobody can help Ukraine now And next China will take advantage and attack Taiwan Soso everything will be okay after dead🤧
This is preparing for Bosnia. Europe Putin does not like Bosnia. Next is Bosnia.
The bbc has lied so much I don't even trust their news media
Western don’t hear Russia for decades…
I'm from Ukraine and we want peace, nobody wants war in Ukraine, people don't have to die! #nowar
puta’s  syphyllis is active and eating away at his diminishing brain and ukrainie is suffering. the west does nothing
Let's go russia
Every russian in Ukraine right now does not deserve any respect
Surrender and end this..russia drive ukraine better
Why dont you show the video where a tank drives over and crushes a civilian in a car?
So much for the lukewarm charade of 'support' from the loathsome EU, though naturally the BBC's woke-scum hypocrites never address that.
go russia go...
This right here is propaganda. That is a strela 10 short rage surface to air missile system, which is not in use by the Russian army for years now. Calling it Russian is total bullshit.
Ukraines soldiers are no use
Crimea was his Rhineland, the illegal breakaway states were his Sudetenland, and now he's getting the rest of Czechoslovakia. It's genuinely quite frustrating to see that these "great" "powers" appear to have not learned a thing from the shambolic mess that was the build-up to WW2. Now where's the Gdansk and how long will the inevitable Phoney War last?
BBC fake news  🤣🤣🤣🤣
Дезинформация. Российская техника имеет символы Z V D O, на видео Украинская стрела 10.
Why In every century is there wars like this how comes we never learn from our mistakes I remember my dad said ww3 would be nuclear but seems to be more power related and I think the next big war will be over religion
Once an evil dictatorship, always an evil dictatorship.  This is what happens when you give Russia a seat at the table, everyone knew it. And they did it anyway, because gas
Here come the cowardly child killers. NATO should be ashamed of themselves , telling the Ukrainian people that we are standing with them and doing nothing to help them , Putin and his gang of criminals are laughing at the rest of Europe and its pathetic leaders. What use is a lion with no teeth?
Uses the Blitzkrieg style of the Great German Army ww2
Where is the UN … 😡😡😡😡
Where are all the Javelin missiles that the US gave Ukraine?
If i know for a fact that we would lose a building, then they should blow up the building when the enemy captures it. Construction workers can hide it in the walls or something or even have it in a parking lot van
It's a good to see Ukraine being liberated
Ukraine is left to defend itself,NATO and USA are not trust worthy.
These are not russian vehicles. Its Ukraine's
The voiceover is horrible
No one knows who these tanks belong to. Maybe it's provocation. American provocation.
RUSSIA BREAKS INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE WHOLE WORLD GOING MAD ! ISRAEL BREAKS INTERNATIONAL LAW AND NO ONE BATS AN EYE LID. FREE PALESTINE!
Stop those Russian nazzi!! Stop Putler!
Media is telling about 1tank and u bealive them.Tank never go alone anywhere,you lying media
GOD blees our Ukraine . GOD IS LOVE !
Terrible. I feel so bad for Ukraine 🇺🇦 . Russia should not be taking peace for granted . What a selfish regime
为乌克兰祈祷🇺🇦🙏
I had a thought about why would Russia considered important to take hold of Chernobyl site... Meaning a simple dynamiting or small missile over the site would be equivalent of a nuclear explosion at least in terms of radioactive implication.  Then I wondered, to what extent, roughly speaking, would any civil nuclear site in fact amounts to representing a nuclear target.  Quite disturbing. A civil nuclear site in fact supplies nuclear technology to your ennemy against you.  Never came to my mind.
Where are the stinger missiles the US sent to Ukraine?! Why the Ukrainian army is not targeting these tanks?!
If you look at other channels , you will see all that equipment javelins etc , Russian go it all,  and busloads of Ukrainian troops mingling with Russians ,  what the hell is going on?
Has russia won that quick
Ukraine should have smashed their home grown far right militia long ago. Trouble is they are too influential and tolerated.
Don’t worry, Bidens will impose more sanctions
Putin has weapons of ASS destruction! And you're next.
The West are pathetic. I'm in the UK and we should be sending troops and all we're doing is sanctions. The reality is people sit here sending messages such as "We support Ukraine" when that does nothing and all they are asking for is some actual support in the form of troops but because of a lack of that then its like Zelensky will be subjected to horrible things if not killed before the civilians are soon after.
U.S. News  US ‘prepared’ to take Ukrainian refugees by RT February 25th 2022, 3:56 am The White House said that neighboring European countries would be a better fit for fleeing Ukrainians, however
Please pray for peace and love one another.
Now no country will give up its nukes
No offense, but enemy forces near the capital on DAY ONE, there must of been some catastrophic failings in the Ukrainian armed forces, considering how large the country is.
*government is likely to be overwhelmed and overthrown “Thoughts and prayers” - NATO members
Oh, so Putin says Georgia 🇬🇪 too. Putin I believe wants the EU back.
Russia's Dictator, now head of the Taliba, will turn Ukraine into Afghanistan. The Russian people are ashamed of Putin. Russians just don't say they hate Putin, because he kills all Russians. World leaders should be ashamed to talk to this killer.
man is leading man to its injury... how sad
Hardbass intensifies
Is Ukraine putting up any resistance? To me it looks as if the Russians are just driving into Ukrain. I haven't seen any figting on any news channel.
So Russia can't do this.. us in the west are fine to do it in Iraq Syria and countless other places.. makes me sick that we can be so hypocritical
What is NATO waiting for...Ukraine to be decimated...west seems to only talk big...however too soft to act...
USA is guilty for all this damage , they were supposed  to guarantee the independence of Ukraine
Ukraine government arming civilians in order to add legitimacy to the claim that devilish Russia is the aggressor rather than the defender of oppressed minorities, minorities oppressed on the say so of the US/EU/UK. UK media will have blood all over their hands again, just like when they parroted for G.W. Bush to pacify the population for the invasion of Iraq.   The EU/NATO are the ones who seek to (and have continued to) expand and absorb the resources and political systems of those around them, not Russia, not 'evil dictator Putin' - UK Gov, EU Gov, US Gov.   The ex-super powers can't go down without a fight, they will stand together waving sticks pointing to the bad people, just because the rest of the world isn't limited or contained by them anymore.
^^^^^     ^^^^^  “The surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe is that it has never tried to contact us.”   EXISTNC
They better wait until those sanctions kick in 40 years from now they’ll be reallllly regretting this (sarcasm)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc2vxtHAEwA
Now you see how Putin “wins” his elections.
I hope they will not dismantle this country, like they did with Yugoslavia!
Zelensky the Jewish president want a civil war so that many white  people die . .. this is part of his religion belief.😔.. he will fly to America or Israel when his mission is accomplished 😪
Russian tanks entered only to be destroyed by Ukraine forces.
Pulled up like Gta
Feminists from 18–60 should also remain and fight since ‘all are equal’
Sergey is another one, what do you mean they should have thought of that, it is their country your taking. You would not have had to declare war if you owned it.  Your own people do not want this, shame one you. You will all be held accountable in the eyes of NATO. The whole world is watching you disturb the peace and democracy we have fought so hard to have.
The Russians have a right to defend themselves.
Is not Russian tank ! That is Ukrainian one !
Bruh
That’s a Ukrainian plane shot down , so it’s fake news, just look in to it ,  this all lies.
Where is Nagel Farage sitting on the shores of UK trying to push back Ukrainians from fleeing
How they knowing Russian army vehicles and helicopters from home?
Russia! Bring back your land! Respect to Russia from Norway
pray for ukraine
The first vehicle was Ukrainian, all the Russian ones have painted massive Z on them so they can tell the difference
Why UK isn't helping 😂
Hell is going is going filled with Russian soldiers.
I hope china attack Russia from behind now that Putin hitting Ukraine there some borderlands near Russia that china claim is theirs
I thought US and Canada sent troops to Poland to help Ukraine?
Viva la Russia!!!
I hope Ukrainians are okay,  Sending LoL from India 🇮🇳 ♥️
Where is letter z Fake news
Nato expansion is to blame for this.  Anyone who thinks otherwise has done no research,  or has limited intelligence.
Just keep in mind people that Putin is NOTHING compared to the ALMIGHTY HAND OF GOD and HE will have the victory!
Uh Oh..
I wouldn't be cowering in the Subway like that I would actually be hiding behind a tree or under a car or something and then I'd come out from under the car as soon as they got close enough.  They were given weapons they should use them to defend their country
People do not fear take gun and fight back.
insane how the world allowed this madness happen
Weak nations need unity to confront those strong ones nato and rus

Check your facts, those are Ukrainian
Yeah this is nearly over. Bye Bye Ukraine.
In some localities of Ukraine, under the calls of President Zelensky and his colleagues from the Government of Ukraine, illegal distribution of automatic weapons to the civilian population is being carried out. When distributing weapons, no one is registered, and also no analysis is conducted to whom this weapon is issued. https://youtu.be/xasIntRON80
Thank you.
Time to fight against Russia, not just sanctions..
Can't wait to see Russia bomb the BBC building 🤣😂🖕fake news soros bich
USA 🇺🇸 UK 🇬🇧 ISRAEL 🇮🇱 biggest evil in the world
War in Ukraine ,pain in Britain
They keep using the same clips if it was a full invasion we would see more footage
USA led NATO, invasion of Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Lybia and so forth Territories. Many death tolls. How do those count? How are those justified? If those are justified then Russia's strikes against Ukraine are also justified in its own way.
this is Ukrainian air defense in search of a place to shoot down Russian planes and they are hiding behind residential buildings
Sanctions will do nothing. If it is not stopped other autocratic powers will follow. Rest will be history.
0:17 I really like the fact that the local bus service is running like it's tuesday. Give that driver a raise!
EU should do more to stop  this.war criminal  Putin's aggressive  behaviour  .against  a democratic  country  ...Next Putin comes to east Berlin and claims  as territory. ...sending  helmets  and keeping  quite  dose not help  ....or sending  Boots ...
The last time the world gave in to a powerful dictator’s ambitions, led to WW2, not saying it’ll be WW3 but history has shown where this can lead
Why isn’t Ukraine fighting back?
Waw
HAHAHAHA WE WIN
Martial law? Forcing people to stay in Ukraine? Evil dictatorship.
My heart goes out to Ukraine, all my thoughts are with you. I can't even imagine how scared the country is right now.
So Russia sent only one tank to Kiev. 🤣😂 You guys are worse than CNN
Its not russian it doesnt have a Z mark
Losing 450 troops within 48hrs is nonsense. Stop this madness Putin, learn from your predessor (Adolf Hitler)
why isn't the Ukraine army fighting them back any one no
Go Putin! Kick NATO and US out of Europe! We love Russia.
The lives of boys also matter, I cannot be forced to fight for a country owned by the rich. I'd be the first to leave. Call me coward but I know life has no rehearsal
Ukraine didn't build its own tanks and russian tanks were always there. So there.....
Fuck Putin & Co. They are psychos and that’s how history will remember them 🖕
The Russians are not attacking civilians... They are trying to bring stability to a region that’s been at war for over a decade...
Lmao I doubt 400 Russians have been killed
The US and its allies are responsible for this!!
Heartbreaks and prayers don’t do shit. Media wants clicks, views and ad revenue. People believe if they sympathize that they’ve done their part. Global acts of terror happen everyday yet, we’re force feed to care about this one and ignore the others.
В армии РФ не используется данное самоходное средство с 2000 года, это фейк!
I'ts not good 🤔
Russian tanks just casually roll in.  I'm going to guess that Russia's military are not as skilled and powerful as they are making us believe
In 1938, Hitler carried out the Anschluss, incorporating his homeland, Austria, into Germany. Soon he threatened to invade Czechoslovakia, allegedly preoccupied with the problem of discrimination against the Sudeten Germans. British and French politicians were afraid of a war that could engulf all of Europe and tried to pursue a policy of appeasement, hoping that Hitler would calm down by receiving part of the territory of Czechoslovakia. But that was only the beginning... Tens of millions of people will die as a result of the Second World War unleashed by Hitler.  Now you can still help Ukraine and defeat fascism
Go Putin 👌🏻 Clean Ukraine of neonacis
I said it before, this war is going to be over in two weeks or less.
None of those were tanks. You want us to take your coverage seriously when you can't identify war machines
God help Ukraine 🇺🇦 be strong !! USA 🇺🇸 is praying for people of Ukraine 🙏
if Russia got this chance then China will  be the second government who attack Taiwan because of no fear they realise NATO could not prevent anything
Why are the feminist not fighting to let the men and kids leave so that they can fight for their country 🤔 front line
Why is Russia invading Ukraine?
I don’t know what or how but I can feel something stupid is going to happen and it’s going to escalate and before you know it all these countries will be involved and the flames of WW3 will begin
Peace for Russia soldiers. God bless Putin
Nobody would think this kind of barbaric invasion is happening in the 21stcentury.  Mr Zelensky you are the hero of the world.to stand up against these evils. The Russian Army can come to their senses and refuse to obey Putin.!  The most horrible injustice I  have seen in my life.
Ukraine is a small town  v Russia unbelievable may be UN and UK should be informed for Russia to stop.
Ukrainians are willing and going to defend every inch of land. It's going to be house to house warfare. I'm predicting a Stalingrad level of carnage
The people of Ukraine need to get rid off the Fascist goverment the US put into power and peace will closely follow.
APC but still bad
America want to build military base in Ukraine Border and blame Putin for his reaction.
Claim is that, they are fighting for peace
Lay down your arms nato is all talk
If Hillary Clinton was president Moscow would be on fire right now!
War is war !! That’s what you get for siding with the Jewish Europe!
In Syria, terrorists have fought for ten years against the Russians and Assad...
And???????……..
One man saw this coming. The man in the Kremlin who planned this.
NATO and America to blame for the lit the fire
This was made possible thanks to Belarus...
Ben Wallace is a Big, Fat, Liar.
Lmao just respawn but all jokes aside I do pray for y'all I got  family up there I hope everyone is safe and I pray for the people who lost there lives and fuck Russia man fuked up
Putin bullies a first world nation and the rest of the world setbacks and lets it happen. Democracy has become truly weak
WAR BAD , Turks established many states, not only the Ottoman Empire, they approached religions with tolerance, took taxes from America, there is no need to say much, it is enough to know ETZEL... 🇹🇷
I can’t believe that while these brave Ukrainians are fighting for their lives, the powers in the EU are idly standing by, just watching things unfold. Putin, just like Hitler, counts on the fact that the West is useless and will do anything not to enter a war.
Make them bleed
Ваша светлость, подумайте о слабости Украины. Они являются жертвами этой войны, а не участниками правительства Украины. Помните гуманитарные науки, помните детей, помните гражданских, помните больных, простите правительство Украины, чтобы прекратить войну
Meanwhile Putin back home, cozy with his billions.
rusia stop the war
Europe...you forgot Iraq, Vietnam¿??? Rasist all of you. Imagine a Russian base in Mexico?
Russia has every right to protect it's boarders from America using ukraine to establish it's strategic presence there.
Those are Ukrainians BTR - armed Personnel Vehicles. No tanks in video.  As always BBC can not make news without lies . But the Russian tanks will be there soon.
This is wrong on so many levels! Many prayers for the Ukrainian people.
Nice to see Europe and the US helping a free state defend itself. Oh wait, they haven't done anything? Clearly a signal that the “western powers” aren't as honorable and responsible as they used to be. Cowards, all of them
Excellent fodder material for Western media to boost up TRP ratings. You should be grateful to Russia for your heightened TRP ratings now
Russia😊
Nobody will fight for Zelenskys criminal regime 🤣
I am gald to be living in an age were I can watch war footage in 4k
THIS IS MADNESS
All Ukraine had to do is say they would not join NATO , get the story straight people
The world is thinking of and praying for you, Ukrainians.
usa: russia is threat to Europe,  putin: USA is a threat to the world
US tanks filmed entering capital city Baghdad.
senseless
Western liberalism has made the west hollow. Sanctions did not deter Putin from occupying Crimea. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Fear Taiwan will be the next target with same result.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7LeNhY4wUk
The west has done this sort of thing to poor countries for so long, but now that another European country is dealing with the same thing suddenly they care. The west are a bunch of hypocrites and I could careless if Europe destroys itself if this war escalates, maybe then they'll get off the backs of poor and developing countries and stop meddling in their affairs.
I hope the free world will sanction russia as much as they can.
Reminds me what happened to Poland. Allies  promised to help but did nothing.
Meanwhile UK, NATO and EU scratching their balls, resokutions don't shot bullets or take down planes
STONE AGE VS NATO, both stones at war of losers. Stop the war and be great again of effective commonality and porosity that flows winners. Safety and healthy distance as learning from "zero gravity" where we could immediately float.
For me any russian person is agressor. Their leader represents them. İf they want they can stop him.
This is a bruh moment
Hitler's first attack on Poland. Relatable
All that talk about maintaining Ukraine's sovereignty, now the western bloc can't even agree on what sanctions to impose, Ukraine is being used (again) as a meatshield against Russia
USSR
“The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.” So sad 😭
How did they shoot down a russian aircraft?
The Ukrainian soldiers are bad MFers fighting against all odds they are truly hero’s to their great nation
I wish they could a video 📹 taped the United States 🇺🇸 raping Africans in africa and taking Africans out of Africa selling them in the United States and put that on the world news for the world to see
Russian bandits invaders
Ukraine is a beautiful country with beautiful people, my heart absolutely bleeds for them, devastated to watch this happen.
Russia Means Business
Legit seen a tank deliberately aim and drive over a civilian vehicle which was driving peacefully.. Disgusting behavior
Who cares.
Wouldn't "laying down your arms" be surrendering?
Russia, are you mad ? Ukraine is an independent country! They can join both EU and NATO if Ukrainians want. Stop acting as an obsessed old boyfriend. It is not an Soviet country anymore.
the same tank has been fimed running over a car with civlians inside
that is what happens when you have a iluminati puppet corrupt traitor president of Ukraine.
Go Russia go! 🇷🇸💪🇷🇺
Just remember that if NATO promised to keep their dirty hand off Ukraine non of this would happened.  Now Russia is aggressor and NATO is fluffy angel. Hahaha how ironic. Some say here they have met wonderful ukrainians. Well, how many russians you have met. Gues what, they are also wonderful people. And the 15000 died in Donetsksince 2014, just because disagreed with Kiev. Where were you when they were dying? Did eny one paid attention to what Putin repeatedly said over and over again? The thought is that you are blind and deaf for many years. Now you hearts are going out to this and that. Shame on you, your media and your politicians.
Z   blitz krieg      failed     prayin for all  the people
🇭🇷❤🇺🇦
Is this tank video verified?
Putin knows there are currently no world leaders with any balls. But hey, Biden sent him some harsh words, along with sanctions
In war only weapon works not sanctions, it's a clear example Europe and USA will can't help Ukraine. Love Russian weapons.
Kudos to that bus driver for working during an active war...my question is who's riding that bus tho?
Most comments here are just one sided who believe to American propaganda. Yes, war is bad, people dies but Russia has all the right to protect their country. NATO are bullying Russia from the start and Putin had enough and time to fight back.
He sayd it,romania is next, and usa doesent do anything?,nato will not protect any of the members,this is insane
What happened to all the anti-tank weapons they bought ?
Please stop war....😭
You liberals did this!
Officers and soldiers of the Ukrainian army hand over their weapons in large numbers, after which they are released home. Ukrainian servicemen do not want to resist Russia. The main fighting is being carried out by Ukrainian ultranationalist armed groups created by the government and instructors from the United States over the past 7 years. These nationalist groups are also embedded in the ranks of the standing Army of Ukraine. The purpose of these nationalist agents is to forcibly compel soldiers and officers of the Ukrainian Army to remain in position and not give up. Those who disagree can be shot on the spot or maimed.
It's ironic to see that the international community is doing literally nothing on the invasion of Israel to palestine. Lol.
Ukraine is the ancient homeland of the Russians and their ancient capital Kiev. They are reclaiming their ancient birthright.
PUT YOUR BABYLONIAN MKULTRA CLOWN BOXES IN THE GARBAGE 🤡📺👉🗑
#WhereTheHellIsNATO
It's so sad to learn that Ukraine is left alone and helpless. US and NATO could do nothing. They are totally afraid of the monster Putin.
Very sad to see whats going on in Ukraine..... So wrong in so many ways but i full understand why its happening...   Cousins fighting each other at the hands of Western influence......  Ukraine should of sorted this out with Russia 8,years ago....  Insted they are gona get shafted buy Europe..... Nato aint gona fo shit..... This be all forgotten as soon as China head for Taiwan......  Congratulations Europe and nato you just fucked the Ukrainian people big style......
Fuck Russia and Putin
Russia has Putin, the West has Biden.
Shame on world and shame on Europe. Big players prohibits nuclear weapons and bioweapon for small countries, yet won't help military fellow democratic nation against Hitler of 21 centery.
There appears to be an odd correlation between some Russian strikes an bio weapon laboratories. Cannot think why Mr Putin would want such labs or nuclear weapons on his doorstep. Very unreasonable of him to take any military action. Especially against a country which has no legally recognised borders.
How can they fight again Russia 🇷🇺  Why they even trying if it was the bookies who should you bet on ?  So why even bother ?
I wonder where India stands on this crisis between Russia and Ukraine?
"It is us today, it will be you tomorrow" -Haile selassie 1936 (Italian invasion of Ethiopia)
NOT ONE STEP BACK!!!! UKRAINE MUST FIGHT WITH A IRON WILL AND FIGHT FOR ITS SOVEREIGNTY!!!!       UKRAINE WILL NEVER BE RUSSIAN!!!! 🇺🇦🗽
What is Russia doing 👉 https://youtu.be/MZwxZtbgmtA
Now the world knows just how Adolf Putin and Russia deals.
Here's something...Hey 🇺🇸 how about you sit on 🖕🏼 and rotate?! EXACTLY RUSSIAS WAR AGAINST UKRAINE! NOT AMERICA NOT ANY OTHER U.N NOBODY ELSE! Yanks mind your own fkn business i know its been a while since you invaded anywhere but worry about your own backyard you bunch of fkn sticky nose hypocrites
Funny how the news is……. Where was the news when Obama n Biden were bombing Syria, to get to ISIS?  Where is the news when it comes to China’s concentration camps/ slave camps?  If you’re going to report the news. Report it!
I watch from Russia how interesting it is that Western countries, accusing Russia of lying, do not stop lying for a second without evidence. For those who have brains. This is not a tank, but a Soviet air defense vehicle. There are no distinguishing signs on the air defense vehicle, which are currently applied to all equipment participating in the operation. Now the question is, what does a lone air defense vehicle do in the capital of Ukraine, when Russian troops are still tens of kilometers away?
Keep those weapons flowing NATO!
❤️❤️❤️❤️🇷🇺❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍👍
Fake news. It was Ukrainian vehicle.
Corrupt Nazi Politicians of Ukraine 🇺🇦 brought the war to themselves 😔
Wanna kno why we will never find life on another planet or even live like the jetsons lived this is the number one reason humans are emotional beings that kill and destroy
This guy is not going to stop on Ukraine,he wants to control whole Europe,Ukraine is now fighting for free Europe...Next step is test NATO in Baltic states...Putin is barbarian,he just done crimes against humanity,bomb and killed civilians...
Didn’t the UN or USA sent help weeks/days before this?
thank you western europe for not doing ANYTHING to stop this! SPECIAL thanks to germany who keeps blocking real sanctions and military aid!
💝💖❤️May God help Ukraine to destroy Devil Putin 💝❤️💖
BBC propagande 🇷🇺🇷🇸🇧🇾
Go go Russia. NATO-NAZI
The Ukraine tank!
this is Ukrainian tank ,stop fake News
b
Don't give in Ukraine. The rest of the civilized world supports you.
URA! Bring the Ukrainians back to the motherland!
ukraine and natos fault
hello I'm Brazilian and I'm watching this situation, how awful!"
This media is fAke... They earn lots of money from this... Waiting for World wAr three... I love putin standart ideology
Zelensky asks Putin for negotiations. Begs in fact
Imagine this all of the soldiers will carry the bloods on their hands because of 1 man ambition...
This is putins arrogance more than saddam n idi amin , what usa will watch or show a lesson or be a spectator.
No mention of all the usa bio labs? No mention of the violations of the minsk accords? No mention of anything that lead up to this? All one-sided propaganda, disguised as news.
Any Ukrainian man or woman who isn't fighting for their country is a coward
c'mon  guys!!! - this is Ukrainian low range anti aircraft vehicle, back from 80s, with personnel in the other vehicle, not a tank at all... .  what a "russian" anti-aircraft vehicle is doing in Kiev alone???? shooting own aircrafts???? where is the logic ???...  BBC strikes again...
How many times are  you going to show this little video ? Haven't you got more information and repeat yourself?
Ukraine does not need moral support, They need Europe and the United States to send troops
it's been two days ... where's NATO ? The russians already reached kiev and zero NATO troops trying to stop them. Not good optics for the west ...
LOL fake photos
how is putin a president. like look at that guy he doenst have a happy bone in his body, cant someone just shoot him no cap
Ukraine Government should've armed all it's citizens just so they'll give an occupying enemy government hell 🤷🏾‍♂️
British army and troops should be totally collapsed by Russian army.
They look like the bully who looks scary until he gets his ass beat up.
Go Vladimir... Execute all those puppet regime members .show these murderous traitors to humanity whose boss.
This has all been building for almost 20 years and we all stand shocked and surprised this happened..   As the Western World postured it’s strength the Bear grew angrier and angrier until the fatal moment it struck with vengeance.. Now the belly of Europe bleeds and you do nothing..  If we don’t help Ukraine… I will have lost faith in Democracy in all.
Russia doesn't look that tough tbh.
At last the neo-nazi party of Ukraine is gona held accountable for the atrocities they made from 2014 till yesterday.
All of this for Putin to show the world exactly how tiny his pen!s is 🍄
I think this US leader is good but talks. You admit you're afraid of Russia?
🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
They should hv stopped them at the border n the roads that lead to kiev but it seems that Russian tanks cross easily into Ukraine..Where r the Airforce ,I think it hv been put out if action..They should hv install THADD in those airports both civilian n military..NOW its almost over..2 days it takes to captured a big country like Ukraine is really amazing n easy without any fierce fighting n resistance..I really feel for the Ukraine president whose plea 4 help felt on deaf ears..Nobody came to help ....their tough talk n promise to defend n help Ukraine is but a Big lie.This goes to show that NATO n EU dont dare to confront Russia n Putin..This gives putin a big boost to his ego cz nobody dares to challenge him.Those US n NATO troops based in European countries proves to b useless cz kiev is already gone n Russia hv won the war n it hv captured Ukraine, a Big country in just a span of 2  to 3 days..
Hahahahaahaha, so they entered city with 2-3 armored vehicles .... BBC news ... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
With so many naïve leftist politicians and pacifists in the West for decades, and Russia ruled by a warmongering despot, this kind of crisis is doomed to happen sooner or later.
Ukraine is getting steamrolled. Russia is already at the capital, destroyed 80 bases and only lost 400 people doing so….Christ.
This is riddled with fake information or deceptive wording.  1. The capital of Ukraine is Kiev not Kyiv but Kyiv is a major city.  2. What Ukraine shot out of the sky wasn't a missile but instead a Russian aircraft as confirmed by the bomb that it dropped and the damaged it caused of which you showed straight after  3. The footage I am not 100 percent sure but it was from Kharkiv not Kiev  4. It isn't a lie but more deceptive wording so Russia has gained ground in the south and north however they have gained little ground in the north and in the south they have gained a lot more ground but there advance has been stopped also I will be splitting Ukraine into East and West for the rest because that is more accurate as Ukraine is split between East and West by a river.  5. The airstrip wasn't just outside of Kiev it was a bit of a distance a way.  6. At the beginning that wasn't tanks but armoured vehicles and they were actually probably on Ukraine's side or were only a recon force and the force shown later on at around 0:30 are definitely not tanks and probably recon units or again Ukraine's force.  Also to get more information and real time news I recommended you use "live map Ukraine" as it shows you information about the war and shows you how long ago it was and any sources relating to it.
Lavrov is evil!
Not a us problem, y’all need lives mind your business
why is it just men?  i support equal rights.  why arent women also asked to fight the war?
700,000 people now know what Kyiv looks like
That's a lie. No Russian plane has been shot down.
So pleased that the end is insight and Russia has offered Ukraine a surrender- The end of bloodshed and Cuban missile crisis 2.0- Now the world remain peaceful x
Nato, take a vote,  add Ukraine to Nato, and put your long pants on and stop this nonsense.
Western media have come again with their lies and propaganda. How do you sleep at night after telling lies all day at work ? Na wa oooo.
Let's go Russia, make it fast so that the economy will not go down too much. Ukrainians pls surrender. You will live better under Putin.
Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth, the Life. No one comes to the Father except through Him. There is no other intermediary. May Jesus Bless you, trust Him, give your life - and He will take care of it :pray Convert yourself and believe in the Gospel - Romans 10 8-10 But what does it say? “The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,” that is, the message concerning faith that we proclaim: 9 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.  : Why this division, in the evil world we are in, we will be treated as objects and put to fight against each other. This is not what human life should be about. What is the point of wars, the constant enrichment of small units that they erode on the people they use in their plan. It is clear where this is going, we are only a pawn in the game and evil wants to use us for its purposes. There isn't much time left. No matter where you come from, who you are: Christ Is Waiting for you now. Wake up while there's still a chance. May God Keep u in His care.  An interesting thing about a disease that was created in laboratories by man. You don't remember any other flu: avian, swine, hiv virus that was also created by the human hand. The whole system of pharmacy [I recommend checking the meaning of the word pharmakeia] is not about treatment, but about stuffing the wallets of regular customers, leading them to death.    it's all business, people do not mean love: just look at what is happening in the world. Evil has no friends, does not know what love or loyalty is - it fights against its own. How to overcome evil? A simple way: apply love to him and wait for reactions. Evil doesn't know what it is, the easiest way to deal with the problem.  [MT 24] And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. 5For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. 6And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. 7For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. 8All these are the beginning of sorrows. 9Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake. 10And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. 11And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. 12And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. 13But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. 14And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. [...]  Christ is more powerful than the evil that now rules in this world. "  Remember that I have won the world <3" Jesus Is Coming - rejoice, the Lord Is near.  Just a moment longer and the Bridegroom will come and take His Bride   I recommend   I recommend reading materials about the 10 kings of the Roman club.

Thanks God it is just one this time,last time they were 2(stalin and hitler) Europa need to stay strong. Dont understand germany ,italy and cyprus! Stronger sanctions need to apply for belarus !!!
This news reader never has a smile.....ow I forgot it's the BBC...
Make no mistake Russia would never try to invade the United States it wouldn’t take a few days like it would Ukraine it would turn into a nuclear disaster, it would take Russia North Korea and China to all team up to take down the United States.
Nice distraction….  Nobody is talking about your 2 year long coercive fear campaign.   Filth, all of you.
Really sad times, brings back memories from my childhood when the US invaded my country in 1989. Too bad there wasnt social media back then.
I humbly request  to  Ukraine people to enter Russia with with hoping own  country which is your country also.
3. Russia will not allow the further creation of an ultranationalist regime in peaceful Ukraine, which poses a deep danger to both Ukraine and Russia. Therefore, a special military operation is being conducted. There is no purpose to wage war. There is a goal to restore a fair and safe society in Ukraine.
Well, Ukraine signed an agreement with Russia not to join NATO. Ukraine violated the treaty. Putin, won't compromise the country's national security. The question here is,  do the US would accept Russia to build a military base near to US  border? Not. Now, who's the devil and trigging this conflict? the arrogant power,  US & Western countries, must be stopped
Why is Ukraine not fighting Back? They are just letting them bomb what they want. I don’t see resistance
Zelensky is appealing for a ceasefire when only confronted with real force???
Thoughts & Prayers, that's all this generation is willing to give . . .
So Ukraine can stop 18-60 leaving country but Taliban cannot do the same!
Support Ukraine from Belgium
praying for peace
Nato is a horse shit tgey are more talks than actions
wheres the weapons lol......................its crossing a major city?
We’re dead
they attack civilians because the ukraine gov call the civilians to arms themself and fight the Russian
Please 🙏 stop attacking Ukraine
Ukraine is ready for surrender.
It's okay to Invade Palestine and take their lands by force everyday by Israel but its not okay for Russia to take Ukrainian lands by force.  Double standards...Free Palestine 🇵🇸
This is absolutely horrible! Putin saw and sees that the United States of America as a weak country, therefore he took full advantage of our weak leadership. North Korea & China are seeing the United States in the exact same light.
*the victim of conflict/s = civilian people especially the children...* 💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
How if Russia  and Ukraine held vote for people of Donetsk and Luhansk to choose to stay with Russia or Ukraine. Fair, no fear, no casualties, economical, and gentlemen.
The west betray the Ukrainian.  Nothing help, sanction is an old joke for their people.
Peple be carfeul with fake BBC news ☝️
So what the world leaders waiting for to act? should Russia 🇷🇺 continue killing civilians and the president of Ukraine 🇺🇦 before they know that this is a serious situation ooh God almighty please help the people of Ukraine 🇺🇦 🙏.
Look at this crap from the BBC, eating this up for ratings. They should be condemning their Country for not helping. They are as pathetic as cnn, nbc ,cbs, msnbc, you get the drift. They love this, they do not care about people. JUST RATINGS!
Note: As of October, anyone, including foreign nationals can join the Army. We can help out without getting our country in a war.
Wow
0:10 you can’t make it 10 seconds without misinformation as you see those air defence systems don’t have a big  White Z on them which means they are Ukrainian
Did the ukrainean tanks got lost ?
When Taliban attacks Afghanistan, where was UN,same thing happen now,new organizations  should be stablished
Lying Russian politicians saying they are not invading over and over again then coming in saying it's citizens own fault for not leaving. Putin just gave anyone on the fence about joining nato something real to think about. As a American I have never liked russian politics which is actually dirtier than our own, God help us
If russia invade ukrain russia will not stop invading orher europian country.
When will leaders tell the corrupt Ukrainian PM to resign and to get the military to stand down  He’s going to get them all killed
Лживый канал!
This is sad and terrible. Prayer’s for Ukraine
Rootin for Putin!!!
Just like when USA invade Iraq.
Obviously the United Nations and NATO have made a deal with Putin to allow the invasion of Ukraine
Where is the Ukrainian army????
This is very sad and terrifying,....Putin should behave well, he's evil to sacrifice people who's living in peace. I pray for UKRAINE to prevail.❤️💜💙
Bbc is fake news
the US did like it before: Iraq, afghanistan and the cuba missiles crisis, but don't care.
West is meek against Russia
2:47 funker530's footage made it into the news
Hope biden doesn't back Nazis in Ukraine cos the west seems like socialist Germany in1930s.........just sayin
This is an absolute disgrace. Kick Russia off SWIFT now!!!!! Develop your own sources of energy NOW!!!!  The Russian and Chinese governments are malefactors in this world. Only their own people can change them IF they have the courage to do so.
Show me where it says a Russian tank, then we’ll talk. Autistic ass news… “Russian airplane was shot down” Ukrainian Soldiers, shot their OWN plane down, by mistake
Ukraine soldiers on snake island will go down in history 4ever.long live 🇺🇦
Where Are You Westerns Who Gave Them Hope.
Is that a bus ?
Someone should just drop on a deuce on the Kremlin and Fuckboy Putin's favorite stable and have "made in china" etched into it.  Because you know, <Russian Accent> Jokes! </Russian Accent>
Is Minsk a neutral country for negotiation
Ukraine is just the first target we all know what Russia plans to do  soviet anthem starts playing in the background
Britain and American sponsored nazis will be crushed in the course of the week
FAKE NEWS !!!  Its an ukrainian vehicle.
ISN’T THAT WHAT YOU CALLED WEAK OR COWARD,  A SHOW OFF IF YOU PICK A FIGHT SMALLER  THAN YOU. YOU DON’T NEED 150 thousand TROOPS TO INVADE A COUNTRY THAT DOESN’T HAVE RESOURCES TO DEFEND ITSELF. ISN’T THAT A SIGN OF WEAKNESS? YOU NEED TEN MEN FULLY EQUIPPED TO BEAT UNHARMED ONE MEN ?  “ OH YES LET’S SEE WHO’S GONNA WIN “
maybe you should look up the Asov Brigade and understand who you are dealing with,  the west is supporting with modern weapons modern day NAZIS so what was the point in 45 to get rid of Hitler and now we support his people? My thoughts are Russia again saves Europe from this NAZI Sickness
honestly, if Russia attacks anything that moves as the Ukrainian president says, we don't see Russian tanks coming at the same time a public bus also still operating and no one gets shot. I want to believe what the Ukrainian president says but the video tells otherwise. Ukraine just stop fighting your relative and declare Ukraine neutral states, Russian will go home.
Prepare for Molotov Line 2.0. Moldova, Poland and Baltic states better watch out.
Waste of life.
Russia is crazy af
2. Officers and soldiers of the Ukrainian army hand over their weapons in large numbers, after which they are released home. Ukrainian servicemen do not want to resist Russia. The main fighting is being carried out by Ukrainian ultranationalist armed groups created by the government and instructors from the United States over the past 7 years. These nationalist groups are also embedded in the ranks of the standing Army of Ukraine. The purpose of these nationalist agents is to forcibly compel soldiers and officers of the Ukrainian Army to remain in position and not give up. Those who disagree can be shot on the spot or maimed.
Where is all the world leader,for me Russia is the world leader
In 2020, i started to write my new book about europe which is called "Europe yesterday and today" and i talked many things inside the book but unfortunately i never expected to start war again in europe, so sadly to all innocent people and Ukraine's respected citizens. Again I'm sorry for interruption comes to my writing way because of these bad news (War in Ukraine) 😭😭
Good day to all  To Ukrainian don't worry about Russia God is with you all to protect you because you are innocent
Why wouldn't they give arms to the civilians?
Terrible
Zelenski declares from London that he will not leave Kiev even when he is a target. Brave man.
This is just the begining. We are whitnessing russian soldiers targeting sivilians in the streets of Kyiv. It`s time for the biggest colab in history and squash the russian millitary once and for all. And China too if they don`t get in line!
I can’t believe that the whole world is sitting back and watching one evil man killing defenseless people!
Putin bringing democracy to the ukrainians just like the US did to Iraq
It's weird, if this happened in my two nation city, people would put up a massive fight; people would block roads, destroy bridges, set fires and dig up highways as a 4uck you to the invader. Tactics used by the drug cartel on the other side of the River.
ДАЙТЕ ЦЕЗАРЮ ЧТО ЦЕЗАРЬ
my two Ukrainian grandfathers flipping in coffins right now
NATO???? Ukrainian prasident is fool . He is now begging peace . No one can help him. Go to peace with russians.  Then people are safe . He is not a good leader .
Sergey Lavrov...
Prayers for the people of Ukraine. This never should have been allowed to happen. America and our NATO allies as well as any countries that support Ukraine should have stood firm and made it clear that no attack on Ukraine would be tolerated. As soon as the first tank or helicopter crossed the Ukrainian border NATO forces should have hit the Russian forces and made it clear they were not going to allow it. Unfortunately we here in America have a corrupt, deceitful, coward for a president who won’t do anything to help stop Putin. The Russian people aren’t to blame and are not some evil people like the Nazis either. Russian soldiers simply doing their duty are being forced to do what most probably don’t agree with and following the orders of former KGB spy turned corrupt President Putin who now has proven himself to be a tyrant who only cares about returning Russia to it’s former communist self. I pray for the safety of the Ukrainian people and pray that a country somewhere will have the guts to help fight instead of just using words.
world is affraid of one man ...there is no hope for human
RUSSIAN VEHICLES HAVE "Z" ON THEIR SIDES. These vehicles are not Russian.  I'm not a Putin supporter, but please suggest something as true if not confirmed.
Russia and Ukraine is the same thing. We don't need a global war for this chess play of America. Don't get fooled by the media. We need to know every side of the truth.
"Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.”  (1 Samuel 15:3)
crazy that shit like this is still happening in 2022
Show video how Ukrainians destroys Russians occupants
I'm from Belarus. It's terrible.
It always amazes me how the BBC always got reporter's on hand.
The Cowards of Europe will do nothing. They did Nothing when Hitler took them over. The most stupid White People on the Planet.
Stone age the primacy of emotions, perhaps the most frustrating and potentially dangerous thing you can do is tell someone they have failed. Beware then, that you entrust such a vast and mighty country to peace and enjoyment of life, all losers for the victors and the whole humanity of the life of the intellect destroyed by the losers from the Stone Age. These leaders must be sensitive to the emotional minefields through which to navigate all negative messages.
UN should be banned, no use of UN
NATO will leave its member country also in lurch if attacked by any non NATO country. NATO only Instigated ukrain and then backed out.
God bless the Russian troops
Why aren’t there Ukrainians tanks there too ?
So the (war) is lost. They blasted the bases and took the Capital in a day.
British Defense minister historical kickass warning looks more historical, And helps how many?
If Zelenski was a target, a hitman would be sent, not 200k army. He thinks too high for himself, and he is only a puppet.
Might have known the BBC would pronounce it "KEEV"....tossers
oh CRAP
Please pray for the Russian military in their quest to stop the 30-year Rebellion against the 30-year Ukrainian Rebellion. Soon all of the Soviet Union will be restored
This war began when Russia blew that jet out of the sky.
Correction "tanks not entering Kiev
Surrender and the fighting will stop.
The World 🌏⚖ Judicial System must have guts prosecuting putin for crimes against humanity +💰compensation to 🇺🇦 Ukraine  as independent country.Putin is not above the law👈
Where r the Javelin ,stinger etc..This shows that Russian force r met with little or no resistance..EU n NATO tough talk r in vain cz nobody dares to confront Russia.
BBC - Bullshit Broadcasting Commission. No.. we don’t believe anything you say anymore .
Saluut
Why are poor people fighting poor people for the elites ......WAKE UP!!!!
That’s pretty quick. WW2 was much slower because peoples were use to violence
"back in 2008" thats long ago, Russia!
:0
Ukraine gonna blow em up easily lol
Need to stop this now. Putin & his cronies need removing from power by the international community. My heart bleeds for the people of Ukraine & the boys dying for the madman running Russia. There will be no winners only loss and pain will come from this.
BBC FAKE NEWS
Outstanding! I am glad to see that Russia is finally reconquering this Breakaway Republic. Soon it will have all of its possessions back and be a strong country that does not have to bow and scrape to the United States anymore
Keep praying yo the invisible man in the sky. See how well that works
Yea think he needs to leave
450 aggressors killed in the first day of the kremlin's War on Ukraine - these are good numbers, more russia's fascist aggressors will be killed there, and I hope that after that, putin's soldiers will start massively deserting the war and running in every direction. This is an unjust and criminal occupation attempt by the kremlin and it Will Fail! I hope that all the occupying "Z" vehicles will be destroyed on Ukrainian soil!  I hope that this year, russia will be officially announced as a Terrorist State with all the consequences. This is not a country, these are criminals running a criminal Mafiosi regime.
"BACK IN THE USSR ................."
Putin: its time to unite soviet back again
I trust no western media.  Zilinsky was bombing Donbass before this started.  They covered it up blaming Russia for the bombs.  The people from Donbass were evacuated to Russia.  Biden and Zilinsky aren't free of guilt.  The media is lying
Nice movie and good trailer! :D
You can’t trust someone else to keep promise to protect you. Embrace, preserve, and protect your 2nd amendment, Americans!
im ashamed to be canadian today we recognised ukraine as a country first and now we have the means to help and are not doing a thing my father a canadian infantry veteran says all veterans currently thinking the same thing by god what has the world become
Why does everyone look very calm ?
Thank you Russia, England, USA for the Budapest Memorandum. 0 help
This war isn't diverse enough for the BBC
Putin and his henchman Lavrov are war criminals. Same as Hitler and Goebbels. They must be tried for war crimes. They don't deserve to rule a country. They are liars with sick ideology believing that they can decide which country has rights to exist and which don't, they accuse their neighbours of crimes that shouldn't be spoken without a basis. They invade and kill—their own countrymen too who have guts to stand for their rights. I'm sorry that the world hasn't stopped them earlier and now Belarus, Ukraine, George have suffered so much from these sick minds.
U.S and NATO  is full off shit and coward to defend Ukraine that is being slaughter by Russia...NATO means group off cowards and bullshit s..they don't have balls to fight the bullies Russia.
War. psychos. Killing so many civilians wtf.
Europe and America are cowards for sitting at home and not doing anything.
Thoughts and prayers and a Facebook like
Glory to Russia US backed fascists/neo nazis will be defeated 🇷🇺 ✊️
Good to see the buses are still running.also must be some tank. 1 tank alone entering Kiev.or is that bus a transformer.
Stop war. Want peace 💜🙏
The first phrase of the final conflict has begun the ANTICHRIST also called Putin makes the first move ☎️
on two vehicles? doesn't seem right
The Ukrainian army should be focused on defending Kiev, not telling civilians to do their jobs for them by instructing them to make homemade molotov cocktails to use against the Russians!
Aku suka itu... 🤣🤣🤣
Putin holds no regard for any man woman or child in Ukraine  And for this i hope he suffers when he meets his maker. #PeaceInUkraine 🇺🇦
The west are so slow to act. Only now today 25th feb ,thinking of freezing Putin assets. Come on. Him and his thugs must have moved any monies long ago. Pretty pathetic response by west I think.

Fake news
WHERE ARE THE JAVELINS?!?!
It is time for the world to trun its back on Russia and never again respect it as a country or its citizens as people.
Mostly  Peaceful   Tourism.    Stop being  so  Racist against the  Russian tourists  wheels,  it's just a rental !
I hope for WW3. Wouldn't love anything more than shooting someone and getting away with it.
That was fast.
Free Falkands
1939
They’re after the president of Ukraine and his family, why are we not dropping in there?
SLAVA ROSSIYA!!
What a BS news. These are Ukraine militairy
Putin ❤️❤️❤️
CNN reported that the plane shot down was according to the Ukrainian defense ministry, a Ukrainian Sukhoi fighter shotdown by Russian SAM. This is so sad, and senseless.
Respect to the Ukrainian men and women preparing to resist in earnest. Слава Україні.
The shield of Europe doesn't stay even 2 days lol.
F Russian president
Awesome!
HELLO WW3
Россия Вперёд!!! Путин Сила
The president of Ukraine is super brave.
the sanctions on Russia,the price of gas is skyrocketing because Russia’s fuel is clean and in the cheap.the price of commodities depends on the price of oil per barrell. The world is getting ars#d by you know who,peoples of the world
And what did not show how the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine put grads near civilians in the center of Kiev, hiding behind them, so they were taught from NATO and this is the tactics of terrorists, and what did not show how the nazis on dombasa do not let civilians out, they hide behind them so as not to storm them, so NATO taught
He has much larger ambitions in Ukraine. He wants to, in fact, reestablish the former Soviet Union.
It’s sad that Ukraine was not a NATO nation, yet the USA and other nations have gone I to many wars that were not NATO nations like Iraq etc… The war we have here in the US is economic. While people are being murdered and displaced in the Ukraine. Maybe the biggest mistake in the last 100 years was in World War 2. The Russians should have not been Allied with the USA and Great Britain, France. Allied with Russia in world war 2 was a Hugh error. Since then it’s be like cancer in remission. Russia is the world’s political cancer.
This lets me think of Hitler. Stupid sheep just following orders. Just know you have your own will. If they tell you to kill your mother as an order would you? You are nothing but disposable pons for the government. Your life doesn't matter. You are just a causality. Keep making babies (slaves) for these people.
Putin lost his damn mind.
Same Iraq 🇮🇶 sorry civilian
Where is the Pope and Religious Leaders? Stop counting donations money. It is time to stop the was by asking Putin stop this madness action. Putin has no respect for Cheaters becoming the free world leading government.
fake news ..the Ukrainian fighter plane missed the target and was hit by a missile on the ground
This is US (NaTO ) and Ukranian Pres fault. They played fire with Russsia and without thinking of consequences.
Wtf Russia is doing in Ukraine???
Europe, America, Britain, NATO should get involved for Ukraine. Screw Russia, they’ve made a very cruel move and completely unwarranted invasion. At least send a strong contingent of professional/special forces to help secure key areas.
Russians lost about 800 tanks taking Berlin, hope it's Deja vu
I wastern powers
Very sad news 🙏😥
RESIST!!!!!!!!!!!!! FREEDOM FOR UKRAINE!!!!! DOWN WITH FASCISM AND PUTIN!
Ukro-Nazis are finished. It is happy day for all the rest of Ukrainians who are the 99%
Your at war and you still try and impose bans on your men? That would make a strong case for defection
Peace is for the wimen and the weak .
When USA attacks a country its called liberation...  When Russia attacks a country its called annexation...  Russia just taking a page out of the USA playbook The double standards... SMH
Stoping the Russians is impossible,world war 3 is iniment and is long overdue, if NATO intervine the end of society as we know it will never be the same again. ?
God bless America🙏❤🇺🇸❤🙏 With love from Chechnya🙏❤🇨🇻🇺🇸🇨🇻❤🙏 Down with Russia 👎Russia is an evil empire 👎😈👿👎
Those who identified as feminists during the pre-war period, should be barred from leaving the country too.
Well apart from it not being a tank and apart from it not being Russian, great reporting BBC!
War is already over. Ucraine just taking hits unconscious. RUSSIA IS TO FAST FOR YOU NATO
Guess the people support this. Not much panic people driving around like normal while Russia tanks drive by. Even buses are running 🤔🤔🤔
Thanks for Nato playing firework in Ukraine, those Ukrainian really innocent.
Thank god for putin
Are the ukrainians not fighting? Russia straight blitzkrieging  their Ukraines asses...
Fight for your right, fight for your freedom! God bless UKRAINE!!!!
Stand with Russia from world smallest religion.🏳️‍🌈
Tell them to fuck off
Putin needs to pay for being a war criminal! Intentionally attacking civilians, what a POS
You have already invaded the other country and now you tell them to put down their weapons and come to the table for talks? What have you prepared for talks?
Russian Military should be ashamed of them selves!!!
I pray for the ppl out there n Ukrainians i pray that they eill realize that Jesus is their answer not mother mary or any other gods on esrth only Jesus Christ ppl,..😔🙏😪🙏
Wasn't Russia supposed to bring democracy to Ukraine just like USA and UK did to Iraq and Afganistan?
I thought this only happens in the movies…my heart is aching for everyone EXCEPT the lunatic Putin
This is a sad day for humanity. Also a wakeup call to the world. Russia doesn't care about killing innocent people. Russia is the aggressor period.
looks like ripe targets for 2 liter Molotov cocktails
WTF that was quick, I thought Ukraine had a decent military.
I hope all Russian soldiers gets there throat slit!
Nice Lets fire ukraine Where nato ?
Valodimir will die..
Hitler did not get enough of them
That's a big joke of a century 😳 🤣  that 450 Russia 🇷🇺 troops also have been killed by Ukraine 🇺🇦 army.  While the West  report that only 148 Ukrainians have been killed
The Ukraine president is an idiot..  he wanted US money but didn’t realise that it came with a cost.  Now he got more than what he bargained for and crying about it, too weak to admit his own mistakes…  The US had always wanted a war with Russia and now using Ukraine to do this, the US just sit back now and just sell weapons to Ukraine to fight for them and at the same time condemning Russia, making out there the bad guys…. Now the US have got what they wanted, to sell weapons and demonise Russia without even using their own troops…  There was no reason for Ukraine to join Nato, their fully aware of Russia’s stance on this, by joining Nato you are literally threatening Russia, and now Ukraine is in worse state than ever, lost 2 regions, owe money to US, try to fight Russia which they will never win and with no backing of the US or European countries, their all cheering for Ukraine but will not get their hands dirty, they’ll happy to supply you weapons but don’t forget to pay for them…
This is general mind set of ruler , that war is solution of dispute , rather negotiation is the best solution of disputes . Itis public duty to oppose wars and demand to their leaders a warless solution to every problem .
러시아야 그만둬라 누가 푸틴좀 어떻게해줘 Sorry for everyone suffering from the vain war including soldiers of both countries.
Damm Russian Army....
I am hearing from  Bangladesh
Wag the dog
Putin is unpredictable, he lost his mind 100%. Oligarchs have to replace him.
If the enemy drives through your cities without being under fire, you lost the war already. I am from Bosnia and in 1992 war we fought our enemy Serbia, Croatia, Russia and Greece with everything we had. We didn't even have an army not even weapons. We attacked them wherever they were.
The Ukraine wasn’t helped by:- 1. The west not putting what resources they should have put in, the was highlighted by Trump. 2. The precocial stance of countries & differences within the EU, in countries looking after their own interest.  3. The handling of Afghanistan & withdrawal by Biden & now the west is deemed to have no appetite for any confrontation. 4. To a certain extent the west preoccupation with woke, pc, left wing & gender issues, which are seen as govt. priorities. 5. The media!
We can say "our prayers are with Ukraine" all day long, but prayers won't do anything. Sanction are useless as well. Anything less thana willingness to commit force is sticks and harsh language.
Yesterday they were 20km away now 9km by today night it will be over
If Putin thinks it will be easy to pitch up at the front door of another’s home, with a view to forcibly taking it, he has clearly never seen Dustin Hoffman going apeshit in *Strawdogs* . 😳
i don't get why they don't bomb the tanks with what aircraft they have left few land mines
Ukrainian defenders are blowing up Russian tanks left and right.
The BBC needs to get its act together as Russia had full control over the Antonov airport in Hostomel when this video was put up. Ukraine needs to find a diplomatic solution here as they are going to continue to be destroyed by Russia unless they work out a settlement that precludes Ukraine from joining NATO.
Whenever the war on gangstalkers starts let me know, until then I’m chilling, but my prayers to all who are suffering from this war…. Fuck and rape and kill gangstalkers forever.
No democracy at the world level. UNO and UNSC is unable to prevent humanity around the world.
Russia is pushing countries for nato membership with it's scare tactics
Why approaching Russian borders? NATO why?
Recieve reports = facts  lol MSM ... don't forget the wepons of mass destruction narrative for the Iraq War 👀👀👀
At this rate Metro 2033 is really gonna become a reality....
This is only mr.Putin’s war, not the Russian’s people.
Russia is morally justified, not the Anglo-American thugs. Replace Zelensky and Blinken with real patriots and peace shall return.
They posted a video of tanks rolling through a rural area and are claiming it to be tanks rolling into Kiev? A beautiful city..  that looks nothing like what is seen in this video. Do people actually believe This?
the US and European encourage Ukraine to take a stand that was a bad idea now the president of Ukraine is talking about neutrality I guess that is what Russia was calling for from the beginning for Christ sake Russia don’t stop until you have the head of that Man
Metro stations build in soviet times lol 🤣
The west could of prevented this. If NATO would not include new member into the organization. Russia said Ukraine is the red line repeatedly. If Ukraine is in NATO, NATO can install missiles there which is In Russia's backyard. Similar situation as Cuba crisis.
What about ordinary Russian citizens who are against the war?  The dollar and the euro have skyrocketed, the economy is collapsing, assassins are in power, a series of sanctions against Russia that are ruining our lives... The Russians did not want all this, they wanted to live peacefully.  now it remains only to die of poverty. And all because of the miserable Putin.
Oh no
One thing the British and the US Govt should do is to lethally arm the freedom fighters in Syria to wreak havoc on the Russian military and get them to remove Assad's regime who incidentally praised Putin and his actions earlier today.    It's really high time that the democratic govts across the world take a very strong stance against Putin and his cronies including the oligarchs.  I mean how did the UK allow him to get away after throwing deadly nerve gas in the middle of a peaceful English town ??
All of this happened is because of USA they the one who bring army for many years in Russia border…
May there run rivers of russian blood in the streets
Russia: GO HOME
1. Ukrainian air defenses shot down their aircraft over Kiev early this morning. Most likely, this event happened by accident. Uncoordinated actions of air defense and aviation.
Only one thank entering that’s weird  why would they send just one thank
China and Russia are the new axis of evil. Sure America is evil too, but nowhere near the same.
Sean penn's  there.   Filming
Russian military vehicles have a big white letter (Z) written on the front and both sides. The vehicle in the thumbnail is no tank, it is allegedly a mobile AA, which would make little sense for Russians to deploy as front line vehicles in Kiev.
💕🇷🇺#StandWithRussia🇷🇺💕
Notice how all this progressive nonsense goes out the window when reality hits. 18-60 MEN, banned from leaving the country. It's their "privilege" to fight and die for their country.   Feminist take note
MW3
The west does this too just saying  Still this is horrible
Putin warned Ukraine and the West that this would happen if they didn't listen.......which of course they didn't
From where you've got the exact number of Russian soldiers who died???!
Imagine a world where NATO chose not to expand onto Russia’s borders
Who’s next? So the world just watched Russia and China take one country at a time? Unite everyone before it’s to late
I hope Russia is locked out of the global economy forever and recognized as the terrorists Russia is
World leaders should help ukraine 🇺🇦. Soon Russia 🇷🇺 will get into Poland 🇵🇱.
As a European I must say it's hilarious to see the media talking like this. Emmanuel Macron president of France used force to stop the peaceful protestors called "Yellow west movement". You literally have Justin Trudeau attacking peaceful protestors... If people dare to protest in Europe they will be met with bats in the face. European Union is the modern state of Nazism. Everyone with a brain cell can trace back the European Union to 1951. Created by Germany and France. Yes, Germany that literally were all Nazis 6 years before the creation of what is now European Union. Germany that flooded Europe with refugees from Pakistan, India and other Muslim countries. You want to know what they say to the Ukrainian people? Germany will not take in refugees from Ukraine. Guess they're not as easy to subjugate as Muslims are... Being Christian's. Anyone remember when Poland said they would not accept refugees unless they have European values? Germany and EU got so mad!!!! Tried everything to force Poland to do their bidding. Poland knew... They held their own against the EU Nazis. Ukraine is the same. Trying everything to join the Nazi empire called European Union.  Either stop whining when EU countries are using their elite SS beating peaceful protestors bloody on the streets in Europe or accept. The Nazis fooled you and have been building their Empire since 1951. Yeah... Try finding EU countries that will let the "people" own guns.  War is always hell. I feel for the Russians and the Ukrainian people. However someone has to stop their never ending expansion. The Nazi Empire is everywhere. Your "swamp" is part of it. Australia, Canada so on. Every single filthy world leader is part of it. At least someone is doing something about it.
Just like come to Berlin Russia don't give a shit I can't blame them if NATO expanding like nuts everywhere
Europe? Where real sanctions? Swift off, oil import from russia. Today. Every day thoughsands of people die in my country  now
The yellow bus.......and Phukjoebi Den
Could this downed Russian plane be from the Ghost of Kyiv
Ukraine is not of strategic importance to the US and Nato that is why Nato will not intervene in Ukraine. The best solution to this crisis is that there should be an agreement between Nato and Russia to make Ukraine a neutral country. Ukraine should not lean towards the West nor Russia. The USA should pull their resources together and focus on asia to counter the Chinese threat. What Nato is doing right now will just push the Russians into the hands of the Chinese. The United States needs the Russians and asian allies to counter china and this is what the US is failing at. Up to now there is still no strategic framework to deal with China and our asian allies keep asking us what is the strategy to deal with China and we still have no clear strategy.
America and Britain will “save” Ukraine from the Russians and then sell Ukraine to the Chinese
this video shows just how much of a vulnrable position the russians are in urban combat
Russia lies
yeeeeeaaa....comon Russia
Never believe assurances from the West….unfortunately might is right
Can't wait to watch the mass desertion and laying arms down by the Ukrainian troops that will speed up the surrender of the Kiev puppet regime. Now thousands of Ukrainian troops have lalready aid down their arms and asked to join the Russian troops to fight the neo-Nazi and ultra-nationalist regime installed by the US and the West.
Wished I could help
Well We basically lost They basically took it without opposition
So glad to hear the Ukrainians took back their airport.
HELP THEM USA .
The world now knows Russia president lies
Just remember  arming civil population  means they are now  under law  combatants can lead to blood bath
Operation Humblebee ..... In standing
Those are Ukrainian APCs. Arrow 10. Russian vehicles have Z on it.
about the downed plane over Kiev, it was Ukrainian, they confused it with Russian and shot it down🤣
All men need to stay in Ukraine and fight for their country .
its a ukranian unit.  russians got "Z" marking on side
I wish Urkaine surrender. Please stop innocent people from dying.
Russia is a state of mind
I hope this war ends soon :(
Strong Ukraine do not fold! Fight till the end! UNITED U STAND!! God be with u in this hard time!
May the Ukrainian stay strong n safe.
west with west ,east with east Go home USA!! American army kill 100million people in 20 year in world
Poppooil  look
My faith in International organisations like Nato, Un and western alliances is now non-existent. Shame on them for not having the balls to step up when it wad needed.
What is Biden waiting for.  Impose REAL sanctions!  Designate Putin a war criminal, cut Russia off from ALL business in the west!  Cut Russia out of the SWIFT banking system!  Blow up their damned pipelines to Europe.  Biden, re-start US oil production you FOOLISHLY shut down just to get at Trump.  What a stupid move that was!  We could haves used that oil and now you’re screwing the American people AND Europe!
Putin is the new Hitler. Lavrov, the new Goebel.
Why only men barred from leaving? why not also women? Where are the equal rights activists?
In 2022 this is appalling and frightening. They need military assistance. Sanctions are not enough. Putin is a madman and very dangerous to us all. My thoughts are with all Ukrainian people ❤️
It's incredible that the US spy agencies which cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars each year couldn't advise the Ukrainian government of the onset of the Russian invasion.  Brandon, the boy who cried 'wolf' finally was disbelieved and the rest is history.
Are they not fighting back?
Let's face it: Putin is the most dangerous terrorist in the world. The United States and Europe must take a stand: THIS FAR AND NO FURTHER! ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! We cannot allow Putin and his private army to continue killing innocent Ukrainian and Russian citizens! Putin and his private army must be stopped, whatever the consequences! Eye for an eye tooth for a tooth! It is comparable to Jews who were murdered in the gas chamber at the behest of Hitler. Many people knew but did nothing. PUTIN MUST BE STOPPED!
America and Britain are now scared of the gulag called Ukraine
Putin should stop his terrible behaviour,  GOD WILL PUNISH YOU PUTIN  IF YOU DON’T STOP.
Ukraine believed the west will protect her and this is the result. They were so stupid. If you live next to an elephant don't provoke it.
You see Russian tanks but not one single Ukrainian tank.
I  m french and i am hungry about Poutine Europe,US ,
افضل طريقه لتهديد الروس وايقاف غزوهم ان يقوم الكرواتيين بتلغيم مفاعل تشيرتوفيل والتهديد بقصفه
Where’s the Ukrainian army?
"450 russian troops have also been killed" 🤣🤣🤣 usless lies.
very rapid movement.
Putin knows the west well especially Europe, full of talk (lies), fear and hide behind their so called human rights. One sentence he said shook them to death.
I didn’t expect to be this easy for Rusia
😂 In every generation there will be war and it’s been proven through out history. There will always be war. It’s just a matter of time
When is joe Biden going to help !!!!
Why is no one helping the Ukrainian people to defeat these Russian aggressors??? It is so enraging to see Ukraine getting attacked!!!
Well done to China for saying to Russia stop what you are doing .
Where is NATO? Never Action Talk Only
Shame that the city is so unprepared… they should have fortified it more and turned it to Grozny 2.0 for Russians
Seems we're just watching and doing nothing. Ukrainians are being attacked, what are those with power doing? Eye for eye
Horrible Putin he should step down
So, the UN can’t stop Putin? Whets the point of having them then?
When they fire, what are they firing at? Ukraine military? Or just random shit?
Obviously the United States and Allies have made a deal with Putin to allow the invasion of Ukraine
"They should have thought about us killing them years ago!".... Ok what a callous load of BS
GO VLAD TAKE YOUR COUNTRY BACK. UKRAINE PUT OUT YOUR WHITE FLAGS THERE IS NOTHING TO WIN HERE ONLY EVERYTHING TO LOOSE. 🤔🧐😝
Why Ukraine fall so fast?
old video. BTW
They’re not gonna be able to last long as biden keeps sitting on his butt
This Strela 10 vehicle has no Z or V signs used by russian forces and has Ukrainian camouflage.
I still don’t understand, what is the logic behind this attack. I mean Ukraine isn’t in NATO yet ,   Why are you attacking and killing people for no reason
Hahaha 💪🇷🇺🇵🇱🇧🇾
Exactly the same thing NATO made in the Balkans not a long time ago...
Putin wants to remove Ukraine president , a government that is been push by the occident specifically USA. Now Ukraine has neonazi ideologies so Russia doesn't want that next to home. Once they knock down the president they place someone else with ideas more pro Russia and they'll leave
Why always innocent people have to died.. for some greedy politician.. We choose them from expectation for changes and development Imagine if we all were in Ukrainian place.. Last year Myanmar was seeking for help from other countries but what happen none of so called super power countries came forward for help.. What we can expect now?? During Covid outbreak none of so called super power go against CCP.. Do you expect that this time NATO, EU etc will help Ukraine.. I guess not
Time to activate and strengthen NAM please!!
Ukraine has no chances against Russia and should capitalize as soon as possible
Pray 🙏 for the Ukrainian people 🇺🇦
It seems as if Nato planned to give Ukraine membership and then use it to provoke a war with Russia and then get involved.  They didnt however see that Russia was winning the hypersonic missile race.
next, taiwan
That they did not completely transfer Zelensky as he broke down and shouted that he was thrown to the side of Es and no Germany promised money and that they did not show how in Kharkov residents met the VKS with the flag of Russia
This is so bad, Putin why
Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: “The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat. So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. They tie up heavy cumbersome loads and put them on other people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by others. But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth ‘father,’ for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted".  YOU SHALL NOT MAKE FOR YOURSELF AN IMAGE in the form of anything, in Heaven above or in the Earth beneath, or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them, or worship them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents, up to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me, and keep my commandments.  If my people who are called by my name, humble themselves and pray, AND TURN FROM THEIR WICKED WAYS, I will hear from Heaven, will forgive their sins, and will heal their land.  AND WHEN YOU PRAY DO NOT BE LIKE THE HYPOCRITES, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners, to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. BUT WHEN YOU PRAY, GO INTO YOUR ROOM, close the door, and pray to your Father who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need, before you ask him.  This, then, is how you should pray:  Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.  For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.  "Matthew 5-7 NIV Bible Gateway", we can use google search. These are the teachings, The Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ our God. REPENT, and start doing what is right. If you abide my teachings, you are really my disciples; then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.  Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in Truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. GOD IS SPIRIT, so his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in Truth.  In the New Heaven and the New Earth, only Righteousness dwells. May the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ our God be with you all.
NAM nations must assert themselves and convene an emergency meeting and strongly issue a response to the crisis in Europe.
I feel sorry for the Ukrainian people that their country have been used as a pawn by NATO and USA with the complicity of their US puppet President in their effort to draw Russia into this conflict.
About damn time
Sec of State George F. Kennan: "expanding Nato would be the most fateful error in American policy in the entire post-cold war era” .
Where is ukrainian's help where are all the armies where are the allies why are they fighting alone I just don't understand this is actually a war people are dying Ukraine or losing help to these people Jesus Christ help them Putin don't care about sanctions go to take him out
Is there no resistance? They just allow the tanks and armory move freely? Just blow them up
Hhhh America be like we don't want war because Ukraine is not part of NATO. Hhhhh 3 months ago" we will defend Ukraine with our blood"
America fought for Kuwait 🇰🇼 but cannot  fight for Ukraine...interesting...
Where are those anti tank weapons?
Go Russia 🇷🇺
Looks like my dog enters neiborhood's beautiful garden and let him pooping around.
Dude this is awesome 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺LETS GO 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺 war baby war🤝
Fake news. Ukranian tank. Ukraine = US refused to communicate. Thank god chernobyl nuclear plant is under russian and Ukranian armies! Yes both! Guarding together  :) where are news about it???? Guarded from Nazis and Zelensky
Russia adavancing like theres no one in front of them…wow
Worst mistake ukraine done is give up nuclear wepons
Reminds me of the Wolverines! mission
Wow bbc lying saying it was a missile that was shot down when it was actually a Ukrainian jet shot down
PEACE negotiation is urgent 🙏🏻
Where is ukranian army??
Looks like the brave men ( neo nazi men ) can not flee Ukraine fast enough . Give it another day and the Russian soldiers will be there on there own. They could not defend a rice pudding only fit for attacking the defenceless population in the Donbass
"UK MOD: Russian offensive failed"  meanwhile russian tanks rolling around kiev
Russia needs to be treated like a rabid dog that they are. No mercy for this backward stone age country that invades a weaker peaceful country in this day and age.
Dear people of Ukraine praying for each and every one of you and your President.May the good Lord extend His mighty power and protection up on you 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
It is of course very sad that Klaus Schwab's friends have considered the UN actions to be necessary over the past few months, but the cat is already out of the bag. This kind of diversionary maneuver no longer works. Blackrock and Vanguard & "CO" won't be happy about that. Now the ("CO") would all have to flee to Mars very quickly with Elon Musk. What's even funnier is that if they hadn't gone nuts, they might be up to mischief for another 100 years. Well it is what it is.
In 1938 Hitler chose violence instead of diplomacy ... the greatest power in the world at that time. remember Putin we will suffer by your decisions but you will continue to be burned by democracy! and yes will continue to burn in hell and never get no peace and tranquility in its place like your mirror image Hitler!!
Cursed be the ground for our sake. Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for us. For out of the ground we were taken, for the dust we are... and to the dust we shall return.
Oh yhaaa go go russia 🤣
The strategy of lies Russia is defending is territory against the west, sorry for Ukraine
at 3: 13...Ukraine is on it's own....the president said...if true they definetely not joining NATO, they fell like they are by themselves
Российские войска по одному не передвигаются.И по жилым районам не стреляют, а что больше нету информации как эту ложь смотреть.
This is exactly what will happen if your country is lacking fire power.
Fight for your freedom !!! 🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩
Virtual attack? Soon we expect to see simulation of a "real world war" ☺️
Well, all of the things mentioned in terms of military operations in this video are false. The 'tanks'(mobile SAM) belong to the Ukranian army and are displaced between buildings to minimize the chances of Russians shooting back at them & the airport was taken by the Russians & held on through the night, until relieved by reinforcements.
America created this war n.ran.away without helping Ukraine. wat a coward garbage country America
of all crazy stuff happened in 21st century, a full mobilization and invasion to a sovereign nation is definitely top 3 of craziest stuff that could happened.
Let us all pray for peace. Peace for all human peace for our Mother Earth. ONE WORLD ONE LOVE.
I’m calling this ww3
Stop this Putin guy. This is so sad.
UN has been very quiet these days. Let's us remember how this organization is just as meaningful as the lie coated with fancy words and pride of old men.
Ukraine wants to be a peaceful, prosperous, and democratic country and this intimidates Putin. Russia's criminal invasion of this country is repellent.  Prayers for safety and peace for the strong people of Ukraine.
Now the hunt for the Azovs begin!
West gave Russians free hand, NATO has ukranian blood on their hands and they will do nothing to stop this, Russians are killing fleeing civilians like they were cattle.
RUSSIA'S BRUTAL BRUTAL ATTACK ON ITS BROTHER UKRAINE CONTINUES.
Stop Putin and his War
WE HAVE TO FINISHED TU LIBERAL WORD ..RUSSIA AND CHINA HAVE TU UNITE...MAKE A NEV BANK SISTEM AND FHINISHED DE WORD JUD BANK SISTEM ...COM ON RUSSIA COMM ON CHINA
Why do they have Z's on tanks?
Why just men?? Alll of a sudden the women want no part of equality anymore??
Fuck Russia! They need to be taken out now!
😥I am Ukrainian and I may die because Putin decided to set me free!!!! oh my God!!
Za 10 , 20 lat w końcu ktoś go wyciągnie.I odpowie za zbrodnie wojenne i ludobójstwo
This is Ukranian tank :)))) what a lie!
Ukraine should have implemented a program to allow foreign volunteer fighters to be recruited. My mothers side of the family is UKRAINIAN, and I would like to help defend its sovereignty. Tough to watch Ukraine left in its own to fight the second largest military power in the world. Even if Latvia, Estonia and Poland got militarily involved nobody would blame them for doing so. Strong powers such as putins Russia NEED to be countered. It is not some minor regime with no significance, it needs to be checked and held accountable or the line breaks at their demands.
Put a stop to this Hitler is the world afraid of this evil so called man
YESSSSSS war!!! Can’t wait for 2024 Trump will be back baby 🙃🎉🎉🎉
The Germans held out against the Russians for years.  Ukraine must do the same!
Lavrov’s daughter should be immediately deported from “Hateful West” followed by real sanctions on Oligarchs, otherwise it is just empty words
Putin declared that his interests in the Ukraine's natural resources and lands are "NON-NEGOTIABLE" as if to say that his way is the only way and it is this "INVASION". This is totally selfish desire, disregarding human lives living on the country.  He is the worst dictator.  People in American needs to recognize his evil and inhuman ego, which is what someone has shown over the past 6 years.  America should not have such a cruel dictator "among" us.
Foolishness in its ful form. Hate politix!
Victory is near!
Every time comrades Democrats in the White house Putler invading Ukraine and advancing recreation of the Russian empire. In 2014 when comrade Obama was in the White House: Putler has invaded Eastern Ukraine and annexed Crimea. NO help and no respond from the Obama administration and NATO. Now DemoSocialist Biden in the White House, and Putler launched full scale invasion in Ukraine again.  The 1994 Budapest Memorandum signed by the United States, Russia, and Britain obligated “to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine”.  US and NATO must move one step ahead of Putler: apply all the sanctions until Russia will return Crimea, Donbass and Lugansk, and move away entire Russian military 200 miles from the Ukrainian border. And after that we will talk about removing the sanctions.   During Trump administration Russia couldn't start a war because of Trump sanctions and respond would be total different. Now... Biden blocked energy production in the US and buying oil from Russia. The Oil prices skyrocketed, and gave Putin all the resources for invasion. DemoSocialists are very "flexible" with Putler. THIS NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPEND UNDER president Trump!
#RedArmy LFGGGGGGG 🔥🔥🔥
Come on libtards where you at??? Go fight for Ukraine........cause you sure as hell don't fight for our borders!!!! Liberal Trash!!!!
Bravo Putin, kick out the corrupt Zionist cartel from Ukraine!
Brothers n sisters  be strong n stay  safe.god's love will be with you
I havw one missile may i shoot?
Putin just gave Russia people an other  Afghanistan. Remember the battle cry of Snake Island  go F yourself
Don't hear any liberals crying about the injustice of men 18-60 being forced to defend their country, as they should.
Eu should take them all in with open arms
Ukraine has made a big mistake in trusting the United States and NATO. It is hard to believe that the Ukrainian authorities did not expect military assistance from NATO. The British and U.S. armies are very cunning or cowardly
Isso é uma grande vergonha de matar muitas pessoas porque não tem nada na cabeça o dinheiro e o poder não é nada é muito triste por o mundo todo só queremos paz para o todo o mundo
American and Europians are really spineless and there friendship is horrifying....  They just pushed Ukrainians to die in War.
I want to say thank you to the journalists and crew people who risk their lives to show the world what's really happening. This is a disgusting act by the Russian government and should face some serious repercussions for what they are doing.  I stand with Ukraine and it's people. I know there's not much we can do from the United States, especially the normal population, but you have our support. Stay strong, I hope Russia feels enough pressure to back down. I understand putin cares little about his population, but would he really let his economy get driven into the ground?  I feel terrible for the Russians who are forced to deal with their governments consequences, but we can't just sit here and watch Putin invade another country without any consequences. It's hard to deal with situations like this without a great risk of dragging your country into the war
delaying the inevitable - they will eventually be overwhelmed by the russians
This is not Russia tanks,all Russian tanks and trucks are marked with the white letter Z ,i know you want so passionate to report the Russian attack but please dont lie to people !!!
all nations must sit down and get rid of weapons of war. or,like Einstein said,in the end they’ll be fighting using sticks and stones.that is if there’ll be sticks and stones left😂and humans to fight each other with those USA’s biggest export are weapons to destroy .
Keep on poking the bear and it will react, The USSR's Warsaw pact doesn't exist anymore, so why do the West keep pushing eastwards through NATO.  Of course War is terrible but this is the fault of the self righteous western powers who has toppled more countries than the rest of the world combined.  The West is nothing more than an Anti Russian bloc, if they care so much about civilians they would have intervened in Myanmar.
There is no argument that favors Putin. To all those who support him, I hope you have a terrible life
How else do the Russians ride into Ukraine
We pray for you  all n for your children,we tasted the bitterness of the civil war for nearly 3 decades,there is no glory. , only the deep rooted pain n  loss of precious lives,prayers fm Srilanka
BBC you know exactly what was shot down, a Ukrainian SU-27...but you trying to twist things yet again
ok and how many Ukrainian solders kill please
why don't you say that this was an Ukrainian SU27 airplane ..shut down by Ukrainians..!!!! By accident..i hope..
When you have  such big nuclear power as an enemy..you should've acquired at least some nukes..if not just pretend you also have some nukes.. its a great lesson  for other countries which just naive to believe in treaties and words of large nations..its so sad to see such invasions and wars one after the other.. as long as there are people or countries trying to control others.. this things keep happening..
Many lives destroyed,dreams and aspirations permanently put on hold,families distraught 😩. - Oh what have we done to offend the heavens? - Why are they watching silent? - Are the birds laughing at our sorrows? - Are the vultures gossiping about us as we’re about to bury our loved ones? 😭😭😭
Undoubtedly the action of scaring and intimating the innocent pubic is unacceptable. i hope for a better future. However, I can't begin to try and understand the great hypocrisy that the west is showing right now. Russia invades Ukraine and that becomes the new hot topic. Yet, Palestinians have been in the position of Ukraine since the creation of the state of Israel! and the world says nothing! if we are going to have a policy where we respect each nations autonomy and  sovereign borders, then we should  apply that across the world. Not just to certain countries which USA doesn't like!
Why...  I mean WTF ???  Why won't we and other countries and NATO help them.  We will go in every other stupid little problem and get out hands bloody why are we not there.. right when I start having faith in humanity something like this happens and it reminds me what low life pieces of selfish shit people are...
Don’t let lesbians leave the country since they claim to be guys !!!!!! They could he useful to fight .
Putin, Lavrov, and their cronies are war criminals now for sure.
People here need to stop btching about evil rulers this that!!!! Ur dumb ass's put these people in power with YOUR votes of bullshit!
I support Russia as  a Indian

holy shit, they are reporting actual news instead of propaganda as usual. who got fired?
Rambo 3 is coming!!😎💪👊🏹
How can people do this????? How can people harm innocent people for greed?! Like even if your president says “do this” how can people just harm others this way???? It just doesn’t make sense to me. How can you willingly harm others just because someone said so. How can you destroy so many lives and destroy families and homes and the lively hood of others because you want power and money? How can people do this to each other??! How can you harm others? This is heartbreaking!!!!!
fake news
It’s a Ukrainian strela 10
Do you think Putin is doing this because liberalism is getting out of hand and starting to take over everywhere? If that's the case then I agree 💯  with him.
this is absolute bullshit fake propaganda  i cant even believe the have the audacity to present this information to the public bbc should be ashamed of them self's Russia hasn't  sent no troops and no tank anywhere near kyiv  why is it so hard for the republics of Donbas to be recognised by the west , it wasnt a problem when latvia , lithuania and estonia broke off from USSR to become independent republics and they where welcomed to join NATO but when russia recognises these new republics which have their own presidents and have asked aid from not just russia but from the Collective Security Treaty Organization which not only militray aid is being sent but recources for the people to rebuild after what the private millitary groups backed by USA and other NATO allies had done to those regions , anyone that wants information regarding this subject should really listen to what Putin clearly speaks and says , he has to be one of the most  sophisticated well spoken his professionalism for speech is unmatched and is probably the only president that is a true statesman and diplomat  since 2014 he wanted negations between the Ukrainian government and the republics of Donbas ITS CLEARLY STATED IN THE MINSK AGREEMENTS !!!! which have been tossed aside by the Ukrainian government and have chosen to continue hostilities towards these new founded republics which only want peace and not to be called Russian back Rebels they have every right as does any province of any country to fight for their independence , like Catalonian in spain or scotland from the the united kingdom.
May God save human because world people blind.i hope may peace will came very soon 😭😭😭😭😭😭
May God restore peace and unity between the two countries 🙏
United states was an a hole in the middle east, and now they di nothing
Why is there all if a sudden two pronunciations of the city?   I’m 58 years old and have always heard it pronounced Kee-ehv not keev.
You british are one of the betrayers of ukraine .You people instigated the foolish zelensky and withdrew.
Dear Mr president zelinsky please surrender , Millions of lives now under threated 😭
Pray for Ukraine!!!
I think in the name of most poles i can say one thing: ...Kurwa...
Russians calling Germans fascist for past 80 years. Now themselves turn out to be the biggest fascists world has ever seen. Ironic.
How much is soros profiting???
Call Adolf and ask him for help.  He never was done with the Russians!
Stop showing old footages of other countries and making it look like it's the Ukraine, the BBC is the biggest  editing propaganda channel in the world
Wow Ukraine!👍🤙 there is Rambo existing special forces!!!!  Doesn’t need a tank or jet or helicopter!😎💪👊🤙👍 free 🇺🇦!! ✌️ I’m from 🇺🇸
Anyone got poptart
Ukraine should just wave the white flag and let sanctions on Russia do there thing 🤷‍♂️ it would save thousands of unnecessary deaths
Stay safe
How much is soros profiting???????
Russia and China have to make and grand new BANK SISTEN INDEPENDENT FOR  LIBERAL JUD BANK WORD
Nothing to do with me, mine or our country. We will not be fighting another rich man's war. No warmongering propaganda is going to change our minds. This conflict has been a long time coming and largely provoked by the 'western' interests pulling the strings of the gangster state that is modern Ukraine.
Max was here
According to some people, those tanks are not Russian. But Ukrainian. They seem to just be moving out.  The Russian Armored Vehicles have a Z marked on them.
ALL THIS BECAUSE PUTIN WAS ALWAYS PLAYING RISE OF KINGDOMS.
The cowardice of the Western World in the face of this Russian invasion is heartbreaking and shameful.  “All that is required for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.“  Find one good man among the thousands of politicians debating a response to this...
Wo sind jetzt die Panzerbrechenden Waffen? Wie auf dem präsentierteller....
Don't worry, they are only looking for Canadian truck drivers...
This is a lie .. Russian military vehicle will not go alone .. a 5 years kid will understand that.
Still no real footage of the so called fighting that supposedly going on.  Why are we not seeing the main action?
This is a crime against humanity.
That is not a Russian tank. Russian tanks have white Z painted on them. Propaganda on both sides....BBC should do better than this
Where Ukraine army?
i wish the world wasnt controlled by selective few men & if the world was truly free,ik its not possible but one can wish.
Where is the Ukrainian military ?
Putin is putting a stop to the corrupt government in Ukraine and the money that corrupt USA funnels through Ukraine!!! Fck Biden!
I don't understand why the Russian tanks are not being met with any defense. They are just rolling  in like they never left.
this armored vehicle was intercepted and destroyed, we destroy the occupier
Zelensky needs to be removed for incompetence.
Ukraines lost
it is  not tank 😂
Russia has digressed to a bunch of thugs.
https://youtu.be/U6AZv5H_gUI
Injustice with Russia is now answered. Russia must finish war in terms of hours not in terms of days.
I think we all know this won’t end well. Who knows how waves of attacks they have left. This will go on thru spring
Where is a prove it's a Russian tank on the Kiev's square? I can't see any marks on it...
I was hoping humanity has evolved beyond war and killing fellow humans for no reason at all, other than ego and greed. Alas, leave it to a russian backwards dictator dunce to prove me wrong
This is history happening, and the ones who suffer are the people not the politicians. The Ukrainians are wonderful and brave people, I pray this ends peacefully.
Ukrainian people are warriors, and fight light prid lions. Russian soldiers, lack good equipment, training and leadership. Ukraine will be victorious. 🇬🇧 ❤🇺🇦  💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙 💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛
Zelensky will be on a plane out very shortly... Get your 'reporters' there BBC.
Imagine if Mexico wanted to join Russian alliance to stand up against usa? I stand with Russia 🇷🇺
If China doesn't team with the rest of the world in condemning Russia and Putin, we should put sanction on China as well.  To hell with these damn dictators.
You better stick with your friends
Russia will be isolated for generations to come
They are already in Kyiv??
Ukraine should learn a lesson from this, never to trust NATO and allies, they are useless loud mouths with no action.
🇺🇦🙏✌️Борітеся-поборете, вам Бог помагає !!!
British Bullshitting Corporation
Putin, 21 centuries Hitler!
Now western union may feel pain of Palestinians and syrians
from Japan     We're going to fight against Putin with you until Ukraine has overcome this difficulties and eliminated Putin from the world. We're calling all friends from my family and neighborhoods and my offices to support Ukraine, fighting dirty Putin with Ukraine.
So Russia thinks it can pick and choose which sovereign country can join nato???
chicken Kyiv
Ukrainian people are rather nice and calm people. I feel absolutely horrible for what’s happening to them. I really wish I could help them.
Sleepy Joe and BoJo must hang their heads in shame.
UKRAIN making 18yrs fight as dead kids is disgusting 🤮
What about NATO bombing Serbian hospitals?
Feel like a ww2 movie. But this is actually real.
Please help them.. 😭
Usa caused this
Thank usa for your problem , should have thought about that before you talk.  We are going to do this and that  after  2 days your army  left  all their weapons  ran away , now you see who russia really is  when it's on,  NATO wasn't going to go, Russia will wip em all. , all you had to do is give them autonomy , but what you did with that school and other civilians  ,that wasn't going to happen, mr. Putin  has the right .
It is time for change on this planet. It doesnt work to have one person with so much power. There should be at least 100 different people that has the same amount of power in each country. And nuclear weapons should be forbidden and scraped all over the globe. Just send them out and away in space to get rid of them. This is proof that we are nowhere near as evolved as you may think. I am so ashamed of this planet and the stupid people on it.
Remember when NATO bombed civilians in Serbia for months?
The West dropped Ukraine. Shame on you.
prayers for that bus driver 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🌹
Couldn’t believe what I saw here!! https://m.youtube.com/user/MrTimoskee213
You are looking at the results of NATO and EU stupidity. Both need to fire their leadership. NATO STARTED THIS CHAOS.
Entire world turned from Ukraine. This is just fucked up. Everyone hates puting but only Ukraine fight agains him. HELP FOR GODS SAKE.
Fake news! The footage is from 2014!  More propaganda by the best at it , the BBC!
👍🏻👍🏻
nato betrayed ukraine people.  they are just screwed. sadly
God help Ukraine
Talking is no longer affective....we need physical force against the Russian invasion.
Ukraine community let's put a good price on mf putin's head. if all allies countries donate $5 probably he will be dead in a few days. When the dog is dead, rabies is over.
So 450 Russians dead and 130 Ukrainian dead,  Who is getting attacked here???? Fake media needs to get its numbers right...Liars
Fight Ukraine fight
😂😂😂good old Archive footage.......gets the people EVERY TIME . BBC PROPAGANDA SHIT ON 📺 !!
Shame upon EU for allowing this to happen always the innocent lives end up perishing
https://youtu.be/cDQ7SD151bo
They really wanted this war to be happened its because of there economy is sinking fck them in the name of $$ they wanna sacrifice the ukrainian peoples life🥲🥲🥲
Members of the public have you ever asked the question WHY DO WE THE PUBLIC HAVE TO FOOT ALL THE BILLS THE GOVERNMENT GREATS? GOT TO FOOT THE COVID BILLS, WHAT YOU'RE CURRUPT GOVERNMENT AND MEDIA AND DOCTORS AND POLICE OFFICERS AND CELEBRITIES ARE PROMOTING. WELL I WON'T BE GIVEN THEM ONE PENNY TOWARDS THEIR BILLS
So where is NATO? Where is Biden Squad???  I believe Obama rather than Biden without head.
Please Ukrainian men don’t run, stay and fight
America's tough talk yet no action.
Al Jazeera is saying Ukrainian tanks entering Kiev.... Bullshit Broadcasting corporation
Ukraine lost the war in 2 days thank god they didn’t join nato
Very sad 😥🥺. God bless ukraine people
I don’t remember the BBC  making such a fuss when the US and the UK invaded Irak in 2003! In fact , they supported the invasion!
If Putin wants this war so bad he should be on the front lines. It's easy to be big and tough in your bunker far away from any of the action.🙄
I hope that the Biden family crimes in Ukraine are at least exposed as a consequence of this.
Russia supporters: it is Ukraine fault that Russia have to invade Ukraine. The downfall of humanity cannot be greater.
UKRAINE IS RUSSIA  KOSOVO IS SERBIA
I was anti-war while you cheered for bombing Iraq. I was anti-war while you cheered for bombing Syria. I was anti-war while you cheered for bombing Libya. I was anti-war while you cheered for bombing Gaza. I was anti-war while you cheered for bombing Iran. And I'm anti-war now.
Game over ....yanks ....zelinsky is going to be arrested.....and order is going to be restored
Send a seal team in and take out Putin would be a good start.
Why can't we just live in peace and harmony us civilian people want peace not war please stop fighting on both sides I beg of you let's be friends instead embrace each other and build a better future for our family and kids the world will be a much better place if we stopped fighting please putin and zelenskyy let's stop this at once 🇷🇺🇺🇦💚
Be aware of russian bots in comment fields, russia has started a massive propaganda war through sosial medias using fake accounts, giving hundreds of likes to eachother on each post and spreading dissinformation to create rifts and destabilise the west as much as possible. They have been doing this for years especially during elections, but during the last days the activity has been massive.
Burn in hell russiam PARASITE !!!!
So, where did all the lethal aid go? I hope it does not turn up on the black market.
God help Ukraine
When will putin start concentration camps for the Ukraine people ..?????
People so evil God it’s your time to save your love one
Putin, I really hope you'll pay dearly for this monstrous act...
400 Rus soldiers killed, what kind of news you people in Britain listen to. This is pure propaganda.
The Russians came to liberate ukraine from ukrainian nazionalist illegal government,that was killing donbass people during last 8 years
Russia is doing this in violation of international law  complicates this issue so much is the deceitful American president🇮🇳
Это украинская техника
Lie after lie. It was UA aicraft shot down by UA anti-aircraft missile by mistake. There was enough time to check this out. Yet what we see is the conveninent narrative to support the stance. Who cares for the facts
That looks like a Strela-10M3 and anti aircraft vehicle
Humanity ought to be ashamed.I have always thought human beings with only 400,000 years of evolution are still primitive and this just proves it.
🙏
Word on the street is the the Russians bombed 8 U.S. BIO weapons facilities. You won't see that on the MSM.
America on lybia was wrong  But still a dictator was killed If pm of Ukraine be killed it will war crime  No doubt putin is a criminal
Do not believe nato they are all liars
So all the country going to site and watch them Kill off each other kmt
Ukraine is going to be like Afghanistan
Lol sounds like democracy when ur not aloud to leave but forced to die r
The Bear wants to get back what [it thought] belonged to it. The Eagle is helplessly watching from a distance.
Bad Putin !
Where is the actual army? it seems they are rolling around like in a game of GTA
that dude is out of his mind wtf is he doing ffs
Where is NATO they says they will defend ukraine.
Headline: *Russian tanks enter Kyiv!* Actual footage: *One or two APC’s sighted in a neighborhood North of Kyiv*
President Zelensky is brave and that is commendable. He's not given up inspite of a sure defeat. I pray the best for Ukrainian people and hope their democracy returns one day.
Make IEDs very Effective and has strong psychological effects on the enemy.
Fake news like always haha 🤣🤣
Peace is not a natural state - certainly not when a former KGB officer i president of Russia!
zelensky even wears the army color on his clothers as if he is in the military. the comedian
At this point very nation needs nuclear war heads just so there nation will not get invaded by The Bigger one. No Wonder North Korea still stands . There weapons terrifies even the US .
Just when you think Putin has "arsxhxle of the world"  title in his pocket  lavetoryov  puts in a strong challenge
Well done EU...  And NATO..  Now you guys happy...  Ukraine 😥
While Russia is taking control of Ukraine right now the world is still discussing what they should do lol it’s too late to do anything
Important lesson: refugees regardless of ethnicities or religions they shouldn’t be blamed.
the Chechen army is ready to join the Russian troops😔 https://youtu.be/WjxhpVY9Hk8
actions taken before Ukraine's natural resources got sold or handed over to the USA and Britain by the corrupt Ukrainians
No one can stop Russia except Ukraine, other country can only provide weapons, but Ukrainian will have to fight themselves,  because i rode the history of afghanistan, chichanya ,👍
So you kill 450-480 Russians or whatever it was out of 200k. Perhaps more. The media I swear. Like a fart in the wind. Sanctioning Russia will do nothing, he's already got the power to go to war and knows the possibility of other countries coming in against him like us with a measly 7000 people isn't enough. Especially since they're backed by China and China is backed by Russia. Which China has 2million soldiers and that much more on reserve. Once heard "the world is like a giant tinder box, all it takes is for someone to light the match." Actually it was Captain Price Modern Warfare 3, a video game made over 10 years ago. All about a Russian invasion. How Chernobyl seclusion zone of the nuclear plant became over ran by the Russians. What is exactly happening now. We all need Jesus.
Did russian troops steal a civilian bus??
NATO: No Attack Talk Only 🤣🤣,NATO: No Attack Talk Only 🤣🤣,NATO: No Attack Talk Only 🤣🤣,NATO: No Attack Talk Only 🤣🤣,NATO: No Attack Talk Only 🤣🤣,NATO: No Attack Talk Only 🤣🤣
When American British French army killing millions in the Middle East nobody gives a shit! But when Russia taking back his own land everybody crying for it!
Who's will win
p Ű T į ñ, will never forgive nor forget that the former s ø V i ə T Eastern Block States helped in bringing the ů $ § r down. He is settling scores as he is old & will soon pass on.
Man child Putin.
The west did something worse than that in Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen etc in which until today the consequences still exist. So it's a legal and normal for Russia too when they did so. It's fight for libration.
Notice how she says appearing? Its so they can cover there ass after everyone realizes its made up.
This is sickening.
Usa and uk must fight for ukraine as they have pushed them to war
I can't believe the world is sitting by just watching this.
humans can spend their wealth to take people's lives and destroying things that took effort but won't spend money to fight poverty....humans are strange...
Don’t enter now, carpet bombing for one week
Why is ukraine not answering them
This show  us that UN is a big rubish I am ashamed of the leadership in the world are seeing all this but do nothing, your country can bee the next coward.
Nice 👏
My heart goes with Russia
Nato is a coward people group no one face Putin
THIS IS ONLY TO DIVIDE, CAUSE FEAR, TAKEAWAY RIGHT, AND TURN OFF YOUR POWER GRID FOR NEW WORLD ORDER
This is Putin's war not Russia, thousands of people in Russia are against the war but are silenced by the government
When a leader threatens to destroy the whole world in nuclear fire if he sees a single US soldier, you know that everything that leader does is out of fear. Not fear for his people, but fear for himself.
I'm disgusted with NATO and the US. Doing nothing that will make a real difference. Nuke this bully boy back into the stone age where he belongs.
I don't believe it
Men ages 18 to 60 can't get out of the country ....they must fight the united states war till the last Ukrainian..  what a shit show
My plan would to be give up…it will get worse if we do any more i know. The lives  they have taken…but theres not really much we can do we can. Hope Americans take out china first and the rest not Australia the country’s helping Russia and then the rest can take Russia out god help us… i dont want my ANY in fear of there children family dying in front of them or without knowing Russia will die and i mean it but right now theres nothing more but to give up until the other forces help god some Russia people will. Burn in. Hell..
THIS WILL ONLY LEAD TO WORSE TO COME MAYBE NOT NOW BUT THIS CONFLICT WILL. HAUNT THE WEST   IN YEARS TO COME  THIS IS WHAT AMERICA IS ALL ABOUT  NO TICKER      SHAME ON EUROPE  PUTIN THINKS HIS   SUPERMAN THANKS TO THE WEST ☝️
No one looks at Russias side of the story. When America was invading Iraq for no reason the news didn't make America look bad.
Victory belongs to you,Vladimir Putin! All Slavic people must be ruled by Moscow!
It’s strange how intimate the Biden family is with Ukraine. If the most crooked family in the US is in love with Ukraine then I am not. I don’t agree with war or killing ANYONE but I do believe this is a result of how crooked Ukraine has operated.
F Tsar Putin
There are two things that the Ukrainians need to focus on (that would get thru to Putin): 1. Delay Russian advances as long as possible, delay their objectives.  2. Send as many Russian soldiers as possible home in body bags.   That is the strategy in most Russias neighboring countries (what our armed forces can't do - we will and there are weapons in virtually all houses).
Ukrainian people are wonderful and kind. I also say Russian people are very good people also. I don't hate Russian people just the crazed mad man who does not care about anybody. God bless the Ukrainian peoples
May God keep the innocent people safe. Putin got possessed by Hitler.
Britain’s shitting them selves 😂
Why is there no real footage only shots you get are from Twitter Facebook etc. Journals where not scared of Taliban but they are scared of Russia?
America could reach Russia through Alaska and attack them from there as well as from other directions. We should scare Russia just as he has scared us all and now is causing evil attacks to innocent people and the world.  Who is in charge of the world now?
Please help Ukraine country from Russian rule
Damn they got there fast
🇺🇦
China better not do anything dumb while all of these happens
This could have been avoided if Ukraine west had quit bombing the east.  What did they expect??  Zelinsky should have known better.
How come single Russian tank is entering the city. It must be Ukrainian
I heared alot of putin lately, he obviously must he a great person!!
The Anglo-Saxons  purposely armed Ukraine to watch them fight to the death just like the Romans used to do to the gladiators 🤔
WHY WEST IS WATCHING AND DOING NOTHING...MY PRAYERS ARE WITH THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE..THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE ARE SUFFERING AND THE WEST IS WATCHING SELLING ARMS AND MAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS...GOD SAVE THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE GOD IS WITH YOU STAY STRONG..🙏
Nothing to stop them now but the peoples army..
Its not that devastated...a public bus go behind the tank....😳
👍 👍 👍!!!
God is watching everything. Humans stop acting like u create this world on ur own.
Biden NATO and EU are giving away Ukraine to Putin! Their turning their back on Ukrainians. All Words no Action! Shame!
One great man said " Being America's friend is dangerous , but being a friend of the US is fatal ". In 1990 they asked Ukraine to surrender arms and they would help it and see it now leaving Ukraine on its own.
Afghanistan also
Why is NEWS outlets saying that Russian aircraft went down that's false news it was accutally 2 Ukrainian Aircrafts SU-27
the Ukranian gov't. needs a revamp. too many corrupt thieving officials. the Ukranian women are so poor their uterus are for rent for childless foreign couples and their children are so poor they're for adoption.Russia cleaning up Ukraine. Putin gov't. halted the the adoption of Russian kids,the girls got abused by their adoptive paternals
Where is UN ? UN is a big rubish, go and support Ukraine.
boring news now. no one in the UK is interested.
This is the tactics of America to sell their ammunition and to weaken both countries. They should talk to each other and stop this war.
Usa and nato have deceived Ukraine
NATO USA EU UK Canada are all war crimes against humanity in Iraq Iran Pakistan occupied Kashmir and Syria
May some "Javelins" get them!
the war started in 2013 with the coup. russia now ends this war.
Interesting how the internet seems to be working, conveniently for the West.
Even though whatever initiated by Putin is a bad bad thing, but why are just men barred from leaving the country, I thought women are strong, independent and equal to men, or maybe it's equality only when it benefits them.
west does worse than this to rest of the world on regular basis.....why is west so shocked....
Good finally the Red army once again is going to cleanse the land of the Nazis praise Putin he's saving the world you just don't see it yet by design 🤔
its funny as soon as war hits men 18 to 60 have to stay and fight. What about gender equality? What about genders being a social construct? only when it serves their purpose. But when they need protecting they want the men. Its disgusting.
I woke up this morning, after having a terrifying nightmare.. i switch on the news and realised the nightmare was true.
my heart goes to al the civilians and people his is horrible but if there is one groupe that i want to take arms and go fight in this war are the feminists since now a real war broke out go and fight show us how tuff u are .
NAZI invaders
Martial law. They are on their own alright. But people are still running away in droves. Always expect to fight for yourself. And this is reinforcing an idea that I have had. I think that countries who want to maximize their lethal potential should establish a Spartan methodology. 1% of the population shouldn't be military, the entire country should be military. The strong will ALWYS take from the weak. The only reason our leaders do not think like this= the weak is easily controlled.
Why those Russian trops are not wearing masks? Don't they know covids are still exist. At least they take a week for self quarantine. Wait until WHO banned them.
He's not going to annex, as that would give Putin a boarder with Nato, which terrifies him. So he's going to set up another puppet state, like the one the US backed coup removed ten years ago.
Don't play with Russia
Well done Russia Putin must be punish Ukraine leadership and NATO USA EU UK Canada are gone to Mariana trenches for sleep, well done Russia Putin Bear
Return of soviet Union 🇷🇺
They dreamed to join America's team. So they angered America's enemies. Yet the U.S. just uses them as bait. In this brutal world, small countries must learn the wisdom to survive. Don't become victim to the battle between super powers.
America put petrol over fire the fire became explosion then run away as usual and turtle down
Everything by OK!
Wheres NATO..
All we’re missing is an Emily to post a petition to stop Putin 😂
We all know nothing will stop the invasion without actual intervention. The result is inevitable.
NATO needs to get involved now. They need to send soldiers to stop this now. It's time to take action. Stop saying you're putting sanctions in place because they are doing jack shit. Ukraine needs support and big time. They need to see other countries getting involved to stop this war to push back the Russia attack. Because they have swapped through Ukraine like nothing and soon it will fall to the hands of the Russians. Stop saying we are praying 🙏 for Ukraine. And let's help this innocent country from being turned into a puppy state of Russia. It's time to take action now because Russia won't stop at Ukraine they will keep going. Stop using the appeasement strategy. It didn't work for Hitler. And it won't work for Putin. We need to unite and stand together and only then will Russia fall. Because God won't save us now.
Well i think ukraine will give up in oder to save the people from killing
There is no victory in war. Everyone who participate is a looser. Hope russia will understand this. Pray for Ukrain!
Even isis fought off russia better than Ukraine has hahahhaahhahaa
450 dead already
This reminds me of the US and co. carpet bombing, killing of civilians, night raiding homes, abusing in prisons of Iraq and Afghanistan. Poor civilians my heart goes out to them and what evil are the aggressors/invaders/occupiers/colonisers!
Those tanks seem lost, just tell them they're in the wrong city.  Also at 3:22 You tell us that it's a a lie, yet do not provide any video proof to follow up that statement. Whether it's true or not that is just bad journalism!
How come no one has mentioned we are paying the Russians to invade. We receive more oil from Russia the Saudi Arabia, and we refuse to sanction Russian energy exports.
It would be tragic if a Russian drone accidentally dropped its payload on Putin accidentally.
They are all consequences of wrong decisions made by corrupt politicians. I heard yesterday from some reporter words like "it was peoples decision" but true is different. I my country the government and president signed agreement between U.S. Army and Slovakia about some kind of defence policy but over 60% of our citizens were against. This is called the democracy in these days. I feel very sorry for Ukrainian people :( but understand why Russia had to take these cruel actions.
Ukraine paid heavy price for believing NATO, AND US.
When britain attacked iraq look much worst right
Russia can't afford a long campaign that's why he's going all out trying to finish Ukraine quickly
American played Ukraine and Russians will die from both sides and USA and Russian have history of destabilizing elected government and installing puppet regimes,just like colonial era but these so called superpowers are nothing but tyrants .
Everybody who is crying about the suffering civilians, do you realize that the failure of the collective west to send their own troops to protect their geopolitical interests has just exposed their impotence to the whole world?  Not showing up and committing your own sons and daughters to die to defend your interests has now doomed the US led international order.  Anytime a global leader from a non aligned country wants to go against US interests they understand that the US does not have the stomach for a war against peer competitors and will ask Russia or China to back their plays going forward.  Culturally, countries in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and South America are not culturally democratic and liberal.  They will naturally gravitate towards authoritarian models of society without the constant threat from the US military.  That spells the end of the US led post ww2 international order.  Congrats West!  While you mourn for people thousands of miles away whom you do not even know, the rug has been pulled out from under your way of life due to your governments' foreign policy failures and soon you will be the ones paying a price for their mistakes.  I wonder if you will still shed your crocodile tears when it is you living in desperation as your economic and military hegemonies collapse.
1:35 respect to that bus driver. That person has got a job to do and eff anyone trying to stop them. 😁👍
The Cavalry is on its way.  NATO buildup for the attack on Russia has continued and will soon be ready. B-52s are being armed with nuclear "Big Boys" in UK and Germany. Zelensky has been told to complain "No one in the west is coming to our aid" to throw the Russians off guard. Nice ploy. Zelensky is a stand-up comic so he's put on a good act. Putin seems to be fooled so far.  He won't know what will hit him. It'll be over in a flash of nuclear blast for him. And possibly 20m Ruskis! All fried to a crisp.  Hang in there Ukraine!
This so called country Ukraine sent phosphorus to Azerbaijan to destroy the forests in Artsakh and to kill the Armenian soldiers do not ever ever forget this . I don't agree with attacking another country but I tell you people something as an Armenian there is some justice . Next is turkey and Is Israel both culprits in last year's war in Artsakh/Armenia
This looks like a scene straight out of the movies.
I can understand Russia's war on Ukraine...Russia needs to invade Ukrainian because Ukrainian would have been used by NATO to subdue Russia as a Super Power and its growth...In a strange way this Invasion is Russia standing up to NATO
Stop the War & let the people live in peace.
Russia attacks because of the carelessness of the Ukrainian president why the ambition to join NATO, which threatens Russia, it is enough for Ukraine to be a neutral country
Well they should just take over the next country over ,Ukraine 🇺🇦?
"World leaders" had the guts to bash Russia and sanction the hell out of them for invading Ukraine and so far killing hundreds, but "world leaders" didn't condemn Saudi Arabia when the Saudi coalition killed 100,000 Yemenis through bombardment and starvation, because the Saudis are an ally of the US who export oil and buy American weapons in the billions. A sad and double standard world where the life of a European or American is worth hundreds of times more than the life of anyone else. Sending prayers to Ukraine nonetheless.
Why aren’t there any city defenses?
mana nih us peleer😋
The west caused this with their 2014 coup against Yanukovych and then going on to ban the Russians in the East from speaking their language, is anyone surprised that Putin isn't willing to sit back and see him people by tyrannised.
This is so quick Ukraine has no chance there is nothing on the way of Russians
US and NATO 👎👎👎
This is footage of Russian invasion   https://youtu.be/73Oc3LbqhZk
SEND SOME AMERICAN TROOPS BIDEN!!!!!!!!!!
Why none of the world leaders speak about this to stop war
Don’t believe this.
What a distraction from the peaceful freedom convoys that the west need or we fall to a authority based leaderships pushed by big pharmaceutical companies tyrannical push for more and more control. The banking families that bankroll both sides of war since Napoleonic wars... They should be held accountable for genocide,hate crimes and funding terrorism. Who are these evil groups with no face?
Ukraine shouldn't have possibly thought to join NATO in the first place,they are betrayers,look what they doing now,just watching the country being torn down.
These poor people are innocent. It's a sign that we haven't learnt anything from both the world wars. It's just sad and I'm really sorry for all these suffering people
This is unacceptable!
Putin (not the Russian people) decided to attack an innocent democracy and also threatened the world with nuclear options. Any sane world citizen needs to work towards removing this modern-day Hitler.
If the women had rocket launchers and not phones they'd be doing all right
They don't touch civilians... they even communicate and help with medicines if necessary. They call to lay down their arms and the Ukrainian troops for the most part lay down because no one wants war. Only people trained by the Americans embedded in the forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine stand to the last and die. Sometimes they  they try to hide among the civilian population, sometimes they fire at those who surrender, at their own .. A few were caught, they tell the Russians that they were trained and prepared.
1:40 it actually looks beautiful. Somewhat what I imagined a meteor shower would look like. It's sad knowing that something that looks so good in the visual is actually uprooting the lives of many.
So the president or whatever he is, is ceasing fire but wants everyone to come fight his fight? Don't bring us into this if you don't want to even fight your own war. I hope it don't escalate any further but we all know what's about to happen and if they try taking the capital then i think we should probably help but the president needs to actually try to put up a fight too.
Too fast too strong
USA and NATO will protect you! What a joke. It is time for Europe as a whole to realize that sucking American cock does nobody any good. We are on our own as we all have always been. USA has spread nuclear weapons in hidden locations across the EU to maintain control. What Russia is doing is wrong, and what USA has been doing for decades is even worse. EUROPE needs to take a stand !
This is so sad.. Ukraine already suffers from extreme poverty.. Ukraine is sadly a huge sex trafficking hub. So many innocent people who have been forced to survive in such a bad environment and now they are just getting murdered all because Russia wants more land. Russia is already the biggest country in the world. Such a tragedy...
Yeah that usually happens during an invasion 🤣😂😂🤣😅
Disingenuous BBC as always. Will anyone believe that damage to apartment caused by shell or missiles?
Imagine how pathetic your allies need to be that you have to plead to stop the future enemy. The US, Nato, and Europe dropped down.
WEST encourage their value, freedom, democracy, and people power. but yet they do nothing. they just condemn, and praying. Ukraine doesn't need beautiful sweet word. they need real action from west to help them fighting evil invaders
Wolverines!!!!!
No Action Talk Only
NATO and its allied nations should be in ONE to Seek World Peace and Diplomatic Talks to both Russia and Ukraine. The world in general does not want war, so peace loving people should show suport to Eukraine by staging a rally in a Russian embassy to stop the invasion. However, If nothing happens then face the worst consequences of crippling economic sanctions. The target appears not only Eukraine, but the whole Europe.  Let us pray for world peace and trust God in heaven to intervene in this Russia Ukraine war crisis. Nothing is Impossible to God.
Poisoner Putin's evil must be stopped. People is Russia have no free speech, a mockery of a democracy and are ruled with terror and lies, under a Stalinist dictator. #PoisonerPutin #Ukraine #Freedom #Democracy
Do you speak English🗣?
Literally the only good thing to come out of this is that the BBC and all the other MSM have instantly forgotten about Covid, mask wearing, social distancing, vaccine mandates and all the rest now that they have another juicy bone to chew on. I'm sorry that it comes at Ukraine's expense, but finally the Covid hysteria can come to an end now that the media will shut up about it.
That was fast
Clearly ukraine president is lying. Russian isnt blowing up apartment buildings. Collateral damage is one thing and is expected but to say Russia is not targeting, is clearly false. They could take those choppers and decimate all the buildings beneath them if they wanted to.
🥺
So sad, if Ukraine wasnt so encircled  and Kiev so near to the border they could really defend themself very well with 40+mio ppl and western shipments....
Remember, the TRUTH is always the first casualty of War.
i wouldn’t call that a full force …russian used more force in exercise then this.. and that russian that fall on resident was shot down or it would have hit military target
Russia weak. Old equipment. Us will wreck these fools
Where are the anti-nation state anti-democracy EU and WEF leaders, why aren’t they out there fighting the Russian army ? Oh yeh, they have similar motives, expansion of their ‘territory’ ! The globalists are truly devoid of morals - they failed to condemn the authoritarian tyrants Trudeau, Ardern, Macron, Van der Leyen, Morrison, the leaders of Austria and Greece ! These globalists hate love of county, love of flag, love of history and people ! They think the ordinary people who think like this are deplorables, demeaned and ridiculed, right wing extremists ! The EU and the WEF leaders and globalist dictatorship are toothless and impotent
I see that Russian forces are attacking nuclear power stations in Ukraine.  The last time that there was a meltdown at Chernobyl, the whole of western Europe was saturated with radiation.  It wouldn't be difficult to generate meltdowns in all of those facilities, at least not for a nuclear superpower.  It does look like western Europe is now under a direct nuclear threat from Russia.  Er, is anyone acturally doing anything about this .... ?
Does ukraine have no military?
Guaido to president of US jajaja or Bin Salman jajaja stuped nation jajaja
Biased western propaganda in action!  Russia is destroying only military objects in Ukraine, not targeting civilians.
Is there a "Z" or "O" on the vehicles?
this is wrong, for gods sake send in  NATO, if it starts ww3 that's Russia's fault
*Spread the Word!*  DON'T post any information about where Ukrainian troops are located and only post about Russian troop movement. If we can't fight out there, we can raise awareness against the invaders!
Russia attacking any country to prevent it joining NATO is an attack on NATO and should be met with force.
Why are the Ukrainian soldiers so stupid to let the Russian soldiers pass without resistance?
"All the love is woth you" quit the bullshit you idiots. Call your friends, tell them to call the governemnt and ask them to support Ukraine. They don't your bullshitic support, they need actual men and equipment
The tree of liberty must be watered with the blood of patriots.
Vivà le Putin 👍💖💖💯👍 His Excellency President Vladimir Putin is the greatest leader of the World 💗 We pray for his success and glory 🙏.  May God bless him Amen.  Have seen enough wars. From Afghanistan 😂👍
Big whoop, armour and urban don't mix.
Joe Biden? Do you see what you you allowed?
E.U cucks should send more condemnation messages to Putin. Who knows, all those messages might eventually deter him from enslaving Ukraine.     Well done E.U - keep sending messages and hearts for Ukraine.
Whole world is just watching the drama . shame
If I was puttin and the media asked me why did you invade Ukraine? I would say we have reports of arms of mass destruction sounds familiar?
Ukraine probably should have purchased air defences and anti-tank weapons from Israel.
This is what a real leader does stay and lead. Respect to him and all the men fighting.
Never trust and believe the Western media!
Russian nazists get out from Ukraine.
NATO is a Waste of money and a waste of time. Bloody cowards.   Dear USA and European countries don't you see Innocent people losing their lives and their near ones?  Russia will not stop here. In a few months or years, the next one could be ....
The BBC Propaganda machine in action. Old Footage and were those tanks Russian? T72 ,T80, T90 ? The answer is no. Just more BBC Brainwashing Bull.
this is Blitzkrieg Russian edition
Where are the Ukrainian soldiers by the way? Are they on an annual vacation near the Black Sea or have they migrated ahead of the conflict?This is increasingly looking hilarious. Ukraine has learnt something- their army is useless and overpaid. No more raises to the army in future for sure
There's also a video of an American and British volunteer fighting Russians to help defend Homstel (I think I spelled it right) airport.
I Di dnt see the world rallied behind  iraq Afghanistan libya syria when western nations invaded.
Shame on putin.he should be arrested for war crimes against humanity.
BBC has been spewing lies since time immemorial.
"Ukraine is alone."  We failed you, Ukraine...We have failed you. We're sorry.
Brother against Brother......
You western countries have used Ukraine to confront Russia and limit her global influences but when Russia attacked Ukraine you left her alone to face 2nd global power and you're talking about sanctions on Russia but dictator Putin doesn't understand words only actions ,I'm sure Dictator Putin will not stop to capture more countries like Maldova or Baltic countries to increase the scale of land he rules so today go and defend Ukraine than you defended your future and future of many other nations and innocent people .
I hope the world never forgives Putin, and he can never again form international diplomatic relations, aside from his incorrigible friends, such as Belarus, Iran and China/North Korea. We've had enough of them already, we need to show them the West will no longer tolerate their savagery.
It's a shame that they are driving those tanks on the pretty grass
Imagine being led by a former " Clown" who picks a fight with a former Intelligence head.
希望世界和平
Hitler, Stalin and Putin
Next Russia enter uk
0:10-0:36 this is a Ukrainian tank
Zelensky-railway station - Haag, NAZIST must be judged for murdering the children of Donbas!!!! Zelensky=MURDERER!
They will pay for the debt In Karma
It reminds me of the images sent all across the world, when the USA invaded Iraq and Afghanistan. Let's hope the Russians don't kill as many women and children as what the USA killed in the Middle East and North Africa.
y ee.uu y otan cuando se van de siria e irak

It doesn't seem to be a Russian armored vehicle. Firstly, it wouldn't be going alone (not particularly sound offensive strategy) and secondly, it doesn't have that famous letter "Z" on its side!
if allows by the international laws the Russian federation can use nor too much lethal nerve gas weapons against the Ukrainian force's cos it will definitely destroy Ukrainian capabilities
I need to see nuclear flash
Stop spreading propaganda those are Ukraine tanks not Russians
now everybody is going to make nuke.
IT IS THE ORDER OF THIS WORLD THAT WHEN EVER ANY COUNTRY OR EVEN A SINGLE MAN COME INTO POWER THEY CRASH THE THE WEAKS WE SAW THESE WARS FROM HUNDRED AND THOUSAND YEARS THE GREAT BRITONS ALSO INVADED ON 24 PERCENT OF THE WORLD INCLUDING INDIA .PAKISTAN,AFGHANISTAN ,CHINA,CANADA USA AUSTRALIA .NEW ZEALAND AND SOME COUNTRIES IN AFRICA ALSO  IN A RESULT OF THOSE WARS MILLION PEOPLES DIED.

Allahu Akbar!  May Allah preserve them as knights alive in Kiev
I thought we were done with this shit... Who the fuck pressed the reset button
🇵🇰🤝🇷🇺
fu$k putin. lets go brandon
Where are all the feminists ready to fight for Ukraine??? But all 18-60 males have to fight, wheres the equality?
BGM -71, TOW.
Nato should do strikes on Russian agression and no attacks should be made on Russian mainland. 1 week and putin will come on talks.
NATO is at fault then they abondant Ukraine knowing they would face Russia a mighty country and zulenksy fell for it. Now he's alone.
That’s so fucked that men can’t leave.. I’d bounce
0:27 NOT RUSSIAN TANK...Ukrainian air defense system - Strela .
Penyebabnya krn saling membentuk blok blok yg seharusnya perdamaian dunia itu nga ada pembentukan blok A dan blok B.......dan PBB juga hrs netral krn tujuan pembentukan PBB adalah netralitas
"peacekeeping tank"
Appearing to show???? NO the Russians are there !
Well done russia.terorist organisation NATO should be punished
Would be great if US and NATO stopped making Ukraine a target by threatening to expand Nato's reach.
Does anyone think that the US could possibly go toe to toe with Russia?   They have been watching us fight wars for the last 20 years. They know our playbook and know that the US soldier is a prostitute,  joining for absurd amounts of money and then fighting only for the  men around him. The Russian soldier is rested and trained by people who understand warfare. He is not weary from engaging in neverending war. He is not being sent around the world to secure resources for corporations.   They have been quietly watching and studying and, thanks to 20 years of war and media coverage, they know that the US has no warfighting strategy and is a paper tiger.   How many casualties before the US loses its taste for global domination? How many flag draped coffins before large scale mutinies? How many dead sons before the people rise up against the government?   We are living through the fall of Rome..
How this happened. 450 Russian soldiers died & only 170 Ukrainians died. When Russia is winning & Ukraine loosing. I am sure this is fake news. BBC please shut your mouth.
Ukraine Armed Forces country of 50 million people have not weapon.It' fabulous
Putin is mentally unstable and knows his time is up. He doesn't give a shit. Time for someone to take him out. 🤬🤬
My respect for president of Ukraine.
We stayed in the middle east for 20years helping people tht didn't wanna be helped  now tht a nation needs our help and genuinely wants to fight back we just watch them suffer this country is a waste of space we waste our time on resources on cowards and pay the consequences
At 50 there’s not much you can do on a war, maybe cook the soup for everybody else god alone know what you do at 60
another day NAZI RUSSIA will be end like nazi germany
With all the lies about covid,how can we believe anything from state media?
My father said to me in a battle of elder and youth, the strengths doesn’t matter rather experience does!
They lasted only 2 days ? 😟
If you want to find who's guilty, find the one who benefits from it. Ukraine? Russia? Think again. Congratulations to the US and NATO who managed to provoke this conflict with their open doors policy. To all the sympathetic commenters: you really think Russia wanted this war? Especially with Ukraine?... And now imagine Russia deploying missiles near your border the way Nato wants to do in Ukraine
There's a video on Reddit of a Russian tank running over a woman in a car!!! She survived but, it's insane!
Russians were forced to do what they have done. Globalists are to blame for this fiasco
I wonder why they didn't shoot down anyone at their borders before they could get far? Knowing I know nothing about war strategy but....
Putin would have not done this barbaric act if Donald Trump or Ronald Reagan were the presidents. You can't make a gentleman's agreement with a thueg/thug. Putin had to protect all his money he got from all the thieves by showing his agression to scare the innocent Russian civilians. He will end his tragic life by an uprising of true Russian patriots.
_Force always attracts men of low morality._ —Albert Einstein War is the strongest argument against the existence of God. 💕 ☮ 🌎 🌌
The USA and the UK have pushed ukraine into war without helping it now
Many lovely people in Iraq and Syria and Afghanistan were killed by America and NATO
After Ukraine..... what's next.....?🤔🤔🤔
R
Ukraine had literally been begging for years to be admitted to NATO because of fears that its hard won democracy may be snuffed out by Russia. But the cowardly Western countries were too afraid to entertain its requests for fear of offending Russia. Ukraine is not the first country to be thrown to the dogs by the Western countries and the US. You should never ever trust the United States- if your country has no strategic interest, then you have no value to the US.
With russian tanks running over civilian vehicles while people are inside shows the true scum of what russia really is.
2022 and people still filming with potatoes? Or is this maneuver footage from the last century? 🤔🤨
The men better NOT leave.  If Ukraine wants to stay it better fight one and all!!!!!
Poor Ukraine took NATO bait. Now they are on their own.
"We will defeat anyone" - famous last words from a comedian.
From london brixton UK.  Russia warned the west in 2003. it saw the nato package, as a direct threat. russia offered ukraine a tasty deal. ukraine refubbed russia.  I am on team Putin. Usa would not want some Russian military on its doorstep.   Ukraine the west pranked you. no 1 is sending troops to ukraine. u dont have oil  & usa does not think your  geographical location is a security use.  I hope Mr Putins team is swift, and the loss of civilian life which is sad., is kept to a minimum.  war is a messy business.

Clear video shows
I know where to spend this summer, in Kiev.Finally this country will become normal friendly state for tourism.
Fascist Russia
difference between "looking dangerous" and "being dangerous".Russia  describes military doctrine as defensive military doctrine. With regard  to nuclear weapons specifically, Russia reserves the right to use  nuclear weapons: in response to the use of nuclear and other types of  weapons of mass destruction against it or its allies,in case of  aggression against Russia with the use of conventional weapons when the  very existence of the state is threatened.   oops    google russia deadhand  The 'Perimeter' system, dubbed in the United States and Europe the 'Dead  Hand', is an automatic control system for a retaliation nuclear strike.  To put it simply, if Russia's territory is devastated after a nuclear  attack, the Perimeter system automatically strikes the enemy's territory  with its own nuclear missiles
We need to do something about this
Just because the west has the louder voice doesn't mean it's innocent in this.
NOW EUROPEANS CARE FOR WAR VICTIMS UNLIKE WHAT HAPPENED WHAT YOU DID IN IRAQ IRAN SYRIA LEBANON LIBYA AFGHANISTAN............
God bless Ukraine. We must stand with them against Putin's evil. There is more to this invasion than what's being told and it's not good for anyone but the tyrant.
Call on the Lord Jehovah Jesus holy Spirit
They are destroying US run bio weapons facilities that have been placed all over Ukraine.  Ukraine is a corrupt cesspool run by US politicians and it’s a threat to the world. Do some research everyone and stop listening to the news
Why are these reporters so dramatic ? I know it's bad but they are not there they are just acting.
Did Ukraine really destroy 30+  Russian tanks and 3-6 helicopters in return?
don't wanna hear nothing the British defence cheif has to say with his propaganda
Get in there 'western world' ,   and give Ukraine proactive support.      Get Russia out of there!       Humanitarian crimes are being committed in pure broad daylight.    Putin's testing out the tolerance of the west.
After watching multiple channels, I get the impression that this lady is lying.
Those idiots do you realize the kind of message this will leave to China, north Korea, Iran if Russia ends up conquering Ukraine and no other country did nothing to defend them
Russian president as bad hitler 👹 not in man of ❤  👹👹👹👹
I don’t believe most news agencies, they are fucken liar’s
Nato is responsible. They should not have been encroaching on Russian boarders. I wonder how the US, would have responded, if they were in Russia's place.
FIGHT!!!!!!!!!!
Its true that Russia doesnt care who they attack and kill, they dropped a damn missile on a 14yr old girl riding her bike. Might not be our country, but more needs to be done to help Ukraine.
Evil … who do you fuck you are telling other countries what to do
Russia is going to be the next only super power
Лицемеры! Где там написано, что это российский танк? Опознавательных знаков нету в виде белой буквы Z. Зачем он там ездит один без поддержки, да ещё с таким странным вооружением?
This is the fastest invasion I ever seen they destroyed them in couple of days
USA has justified again that he could fight only in Movies..!! 😂😂Now, Hollywood too cant pretend that USA is the protector of the world if the world is in danger.
Welcome to the comment section where everyone thinks thier a general 🤦‍♂️ 99.9 % of you haven't a, clue
Prayers for Ukranians
These ppl had years of warning, go Russia
President Putin is the most wise leader of all. The problem was arising from USA and it's supporters.
Stop crying too much for Ukraine, because more than half the country is ruled by interlopers. Their whole system is corrupt!
Russia needs to pay for this!!!!!!  What ever it takes!!!!!
Yess!!!!!!!!!!!We love you Russia!!!!!!! Denazify Ukraine, 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
British russophobia is unbeatable. 🤣🤣🤣
I like how the bus driver thought that his work ethic was more important than his existence.
I was laying in bed last night just thinking about the poor Ukrainian soldiers and civilians that were fighting for their country and their lives at that very moment.   What an absolute disgrace.  What’s even worse is that Russia are blaming Ukraine for wanting to join NATO, and then Russia go and prove exactly why NATO needs to exist..
Although Putin is threading nuclear war, the west still needs to engage militarily.  Putin will use his momentum to move into Poland next.
GG EZ
FACK YOU PUTIN!!! AND HIS PUPPETS😭
I have a feeling that this is just the beginning of a long time of war in Europe
Adolf putin
Send the liberal snowflakes over so they can understand the definition of the word "man" and that "men" have penises and don't wear dresses
All the talk about fighting back until they had seen the West was not going beyond sanctions. This is what happens when you become a western pawn. Not good allies.
US said they will help.. but they didnt specify what kind of help.. lol.. help watching..
Boycott US
You present the information a little changed, the equipment located in the city, which is shown, is just not Russian, but Ukrainian, according to how many Russian equipment has markings in the form of the letter Z. This is a standard recognition scheme (friend -foe).
Where is the NATO ? Get ready for China now 😉😉😉
But Biden told us Americans he would stand up to Putin.
Putin is reckless and unstable, he must be stopped
People understand that putin has sent in his weak forces , cheap militants and vehicle as his meat shield…. Before his main force enters Ukraine. Our leaders need to send troops in NOW! Non of this bullshit sanctions! I’d be happy to sign up and fight 👍🏻🇬🇧
Nato should fight this   you gonna end up fighting it anyway.  cause China an Russia are planning on taking the US in 2050   might aswell fight now, while they not that prepared   Cause you going to war with them in 30 years regardless
Let's go russia
Where is NATO. where are us soldiers. Poor Ukraine's believed they would receive help.
50,000 people used to live here, now it’s a ghost town.
Hi, I am from Kiev, look on russian missioner on tank drive to car https://www.youtube.com/shorts/e1zJaTEA160
USA is good provoking - its time to go and help Ukraine. Totally crazy
And the world stays still while civians are targeted. Whats wrong with the world?
That building seems to be a mortar damage. Tanks will punch in a big wide hole...
Не верьте это ложь пропаганда, народ Украины с радостью встречает российских освободителей 🇺🇦🤝🇷🇺
USA totally screwed Ukraine.
Bbcrussiadestroyed8USbiolabsandnonewsreportwhy
Covid now this...poor Ukraine, I really feel for them...it must be awful out there.
UK REPORTED 450 DEAD RUSSIAN SOLDIER WHAT A PROPAGONDA HOW DID HE KNOW LYING TO YOUR PEOPLE IS THE SAME AS THE POLITICIANS IN UK FK OFF
Democracy and freedom is sacrificed for oil...again and always. No one will come to their side aa long as putin controls oil...it won't stop in Ukraine
NATO should have addressed Russia concern's Ukraine only themselves to blame.
Ukraine tenks No Rusian
And the world is just watching while Putin invading and killing Ukrainians, WHAT A LAME COWARD WORLD, SO WHAT'S THE USE OF A SUPER POWER WHEN ITS CLEARLY THEY ARE JUST WATCHING UKRAINIANS DIE, WHAT A USELESS NATO AND THE WORLD, I WILL NOT MENTION AMERICA BECAUSE THEY ARE NO LONGER THE SUPER POWER, THEIR LEADER IS WEAK DUMB AND USELESS ROTTEN OLD MAN, I FEEL SORRY FOR THE UKRAINIANS, IF I HAVE ONLY SUPER POWER SIR I WILL PERSONALLY TAKE CARE PUTIN ALONG WITH BIDEN
When a nation attacks another its a confirmation that it's leader is a failure.
If I was the Ukrainian president I would get the hell out of there now
This is terrible
https://youtu.be/3nUcOENE9-8
Anything Russian you see around Kyiv at this time was airdropped in either at or around the airport. They didn't break through the Ukrainian lines, they flew over them. So it's not as bad as it sounds.
Prayers to russian army to stop (devil = nato ) plans
Is there no international law to prevent forced conscription when citizens seek refuge with their families? ***Please verify***
First thing the UN is of no use, it could never stop a war
Let the people go, don't dam them behind the iron curtain...
NATO = Not Action Talk Only 🥴
Russia invading Ukraine . China invading Taiwan. Taliban invaded Afghanistan . (Meanwhile US , UNO AND OTHERS) Why India is investigating Ranaayub😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  worst state usa and worst org  Uno   .  Respect      -1000
This is Heart-breaking indeed. Wish that people had this same reaction when Palestine was invaded
Ukraine
And the West just watches and eating popcorn
Where's the ghost at
Why in the hell there's no one helping them out ?!!!
Weird that Ukraine still didn't do anything about the entering Russian armed vircles
russia is doing the right thing by ukraine  being with americas and europe it makes the enemies of russia at its doorstep imagine russias allies being right next to america or in erurope yeah... america wont be a huge fan
If there gonna trap those boys in their country, ill gladly go make it a little more free for them.. fuck russia. America said put me in coach...
I would like to see a segment that strictly covers NATO's encouragement and desire to place missiles at the border of Russia through having Ukraine join NATO and how long this is been going on in building up?
Dead to UK
He could get a ticket for driving over that grass.
What a lies!! Bullshit lies !! Bullshit mass media scumbag!! BBC fake shit news!! They are not bombing civilians!!
🇷🇺🤝🇺🇦
Has Ukraine surrendered yet? Go Russia! сука блять!
I'm a part of WW III history😱
let them kill each other!!
Why we didn't give them landmines and shit?
Now what is UN ? Just a piece of shit
Where's the defense !!!! USA and Allies gave Ukraine tons of arms....use them !!!
2:24 nice censorship
US and Nato also must be held responsible. Leaving Ukraine on its own after their arrogance left this to happen first of all
This is clear to the world that USA 🇺🇸 has transformed into a paper tiger. So if any one depends on them they are on their own during crisis time. Other than a big mouth Biden has nothing to offer. What a downfall for a mighty global power
NATO = No Action, Talk Only
Stop rusia invansi ukrania
It's disturbing that leaders make wars just because it's an easier and more profitable way than negotiating and don't count human lives. If it was them or their children that had to be drafted, then suddenly they would have found other ways of solving their problems
Big Black C... News
There goes the Biden administrations cash cow.
The Taliban would know what to do.
Propaganda at its finest.
@1.35 what is the bus doing behind the tank?
This is Jordan all over again from 2008.  Putin is succeeding in rebuilding the Soviet Union again.  He is going to kill so many people, just like WWII again.
You give civilians gun they are targets too
Before posting lies about Russian tunk check who belong to that tank!  Russia forever
Ukrainian land been turned into a slaughter house dont let it get out of hand
russians dont know how to drive 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Such senseless loss of life for a pathetically weak man’s ego.
#nukerussia
This is horrifying. Some of the Russian soldiers might not be vaccinated!
Lavrov should be detained by un council under warcrime charges. If Russia can act like ww2 dogs so can we.
There should be only ONE target! ONE! Where's Waldo???!!! The whole world should be looking for WALDO. Every single breathing human being should be trying to stop him bc it effects every single one of us.  If or when he succeeds, its going to be open season on this sort of sht. China next with Taiwan.  Stop that madman now, before this gets worse. And it can ONLY get worse.
We do need to do more. If you don't up tyrants, they do not stop. He is our generations Hitler and we must not look back on this moment and realise we let it happen. History tells us.
Biden You are not a Russian puppet
Ukraine wants to be part of NATO precisely because of the threats from Russia. If Russia didn't bully and threaten Ukraine as they have for decades then Ukraine wouldn't feel the need to be a part of NATO.
These were the same tanks that turned Afghanistan into debris back in the 90s l, my mate says he witnessed about 50 tanks passing by his city, he said if a tank was to pass by on a road it would Destroyed the entire road. Lets not forget that.
Emperor Palputin can not prevail. Support Ukraine!
The west and the Ukrain's stupid leadership responsible for all this misery, only 2 legitimate demand was on the table from Russia, Ukrain could be a prosperous country keeping good relation with  Russa rather than being pawn of west.
Mungu awasaidie 😭🙏
I'm a Japanese high school student. I'm not good at writing and speaking English, so I'm using a translation app. Please understand even if the sentence is strange. I'm in Japan, Asia, and geographically very far away, but I'm heartbroken that there are victims of citizens and soldiers in both Ukraine and Russia. There's nothing to benefit from a war. There is nothing to make future generations happy at the expense. All that remains is sadness and hatred. That's obvious after repeated conflicts in human history so far. It's a beautiful thing for "children" who have just come out into society, but before making any more sacrifices and hatred, please choose and act for each other's leaders to throw away their weapons. No one wants people to die. I wish you peace.
Usa and france and uk kill millions of people in africa or asia every year and this is not covered by news. Now a pure white country is invaded, they feel shocked. Is this also white supremace?
This is terrible I feel so sorry for the people of Ukraine 🇺🇦  USA,  NATO,  European union,  should have taken Russia 🇷🇺 seriously but they only care about their shit
Where is LGBT to put the stop to heterosexual aggression?!!!
YES 😎💪🏾💪🏾 ❤️🇷🇺❤️🇷🇺❤️🇷🇺❤️🇨🇳❤️🇨🇳❤️ LONG LIVE RUSSIA 😎 FALL OF KYIV COMMING
We can only imagine what people there are going through. What does war solve..... nothing just misery 💔
Putin can only feel like a man by bullying people, he can't even get a woman, he's a pitiful man.
No “Z” on side of tracked vehicle?
close to what happened to iraq in 2003 but it was 10x worst
come on ukraine! i thought ya'll the land of cossacks n tatars? you can take russia!
I'm surprised russia might take kyiv in days
My heart is with the men made to stay and fight. It is a shame our country won’t do much to help their brave souls.
Hoping battle is almost over. Most important count index is human lives
Is it just me or does Russian equipment look outdated… whos flying those helicopters Rambo
Pls do not forgot about UA........       PLS DONT FORGET US
Ukraine use IED’s !!!!!!!
Complete lies and propaganda.
Go Russia. Kick all elements of NATO out of there.
Men age 18 - 60 barred from leaving the Country due to the Ukrainian Presidents first act after imposing Martial Law.  Russia's main issue was Ukraine joining NATO.  Now you're drafted to fight for it.
Zelinski seems like not in ukrain but speaking from ukrain. War is game of attrition. To die or to fight for an  illusion. Keep motivation of democracy of people for the rich.
Nonsense leader and idiots, wow nice countries may help whole world and all animals. They waste human intelligence on stupid war . ?????!???????
The question is "where's NATO?"
Send in the troops
Stop being weak U.N attack instead of support.. this is bs
A hero president must be safe
This is what Putin wants to prove to Ukraine that UN NATO or the US will not go to war for Ukraine. All they can do is impose sanctions but no real protection. The UN NATO and US needs to send their forces now and drive out Russia if they want Ukraine to join NATO.
NOW REPORTING FROM SOCIAL MEDIA ...???? THE RUSSIAN TANKS HAVE Z MARKED ON THEM AS REPORTED EARLIER...DONT THINK FACTS ARE CORRECT AS UKRANIAN ARMY IS ALSO LOCKING OFF THE CITY..THERE ARE CIVILIAN VEHICLES ROLLING AROUND AS USUAL EVEN A BUS
WE NEED TO DO MORE FS
The reason for that is the war, Biden and Europe. Death to America, Europe and Israel. Death to the traitors. The people of Egypt and the Arabs are with the great Russia ❤️ that pays for its security and stability from the enemies of Islam and humanity. The dog of Israel is killing the children of Palestine and women. Where are you, dogs of the West, wait for the day of judgment 🇪🇬❤️ Russia  the bone ❤️
The West likes to pray one of them is suffering, but ignore the suffering of other nations when they attack and kill. HYPOCRITES
Stay strong Russia 🇷🇺
You didnt listen us whwn we talked now ypu are watching like rats all of you
Yeah we got yer back says America... a week after evacuating everyone and bunkering down two countries away...   Note too the BBC will NOT remind us all that the legitimate government of the Ukraine was illegally and deliberately overthrown by the PNAC group of American elite led by Victoria Nuland who oversaw that regime change, so it seems the Ukrainians can only self determine if they kneel at the twisted cross of Yankdom first.
Free Palestine 🇵🇸 free Kashmir
🇷🇺👍
Why ur news is one sided? Why u not report.about the motive for.russia to.attack? It not that.russian soldiers want to attack. But have to out of selve defence. And who caused.that?
About time let the Europeans countries feal like the Middle East LoL
Surprised the tanks aren't firing at the buses and cars next to them.  Surreal.
We playing this shit rn in COD mobile 🤣🏃
THE HUMAN RACE WILL RISE UP AGAINST TYRANTS LIKE PUTIN ,THEIR TIME HAS PASSED LIKE THE HITLERS AND SADDAM BIN LADEN AND GADAFFI, AND THE HUMAN RACE IS NOW LOOKING AT YOU PUTIN YOU ARE IN ITS SIGHTS, AND YOU BETTER GET READY FOR A CONFLICT YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.WE HAVE JUST SEEN A WORLD WIDE PANDEMIC, THE PEOPLE ARE READY FOR PEACE AND JOY AND YOU WONT STOP THIS, THE YOUTH OF ALL COLOURS AND THEIR BABIES WILL STOP YOU, ITS NOT THE AMERICANS OR THE UK ITS THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE THAT ARE SICK OF YOU, AND THE DAMAGE YOU BRING, SO NOW LOOK INSIDE YOURSELVES BECAUSE WE HAVE TO CHANGE FROM WITHIN, THE WORLD IS OK ITS WE WHO HAVE TO CHANGE, AND NEVER SEE CONFLICT IN OURSELVES OR ANYWHERE ELSE.
Why are we not doing more to help?????
Someone just put this bozzo(Putin) to sleep forever!
Despite being over here in America, never before in my life have I have ever felt such so much fear and terror for a country and her people.  Nor have I felt such pain and sadness for them and that the world can only stand by and watch.  I hope that somehow and something snaps inside of Putin and he stops this before its too late or that the US, EU and NATO try to talk some sense of reason into him.
Weak government,  weak leaders,  corruption, US and NATO expansion,  and ukraine 🇺🇦 pay the price.  People and their ego.   Ukraine 🇺🇦 must grown  its economy, military and cannot depend itself on Other country
We cannot change Russians,  they have to change themselves and get rid of this beast.
Ukraine should’ve stayed neutral or even better to become Russia’s ally but they made a huge mistake listening to NATO and the corrupt U.S president sleepy Joe and look what happened to Ukraine!   Ukraine’s president should’ve learnt his lesson from the involvements of the U.S in Iraq, Libya, Syria and Afghanistan and the outcome of wasn’t good!   Ukraine, NATO and the U.S threatened Russia’s national security and Putin acted fast and took control of the situation, any sane leader would’ve done the same thing.   I don’t condone wars and invasions of other nations but when you play with fire then be prepared to face the consequences.   Ukraine made a huge mistake in negotiating with the U.S/NATO.
If Western countries (USA, Canada,etc) gets involved,  it's officially World War 3
Russia 🇷🇺 oyeeeee💪💪💪💪💪💪
And where are Palestine? Where are Iraq? Where are Syria? When Russia attack someone, people will scold Russia. But when America attack someone? Nobody cares, nobody say about their crime. And yes, Western people are racist.
The western world and USA  shouldn't be shame.  They let's the Ukraine 🇺🇦 people died and destroyed by Putin. Sanctions and sanctions and sanctions,  it's that all the western world and USA and NATO  can do, for helping Ukraine 🇺🇦.  The biggest military power number number US It's are fucin jokes 🤣  the only they military power muscles 💪 against the Arab worlds. When the enemies it's Russia 🇷🇺.  They are be chicken 🐔.  Joe Biden 😆😆😆
Whats puppet nato and greedy USA's doing they can just destroy weak nations and muslim countries
Has the Jewish president of Ukraine armed himself and gone on the streets to protect his people that he's embezzled there money from for years? Or is he talking from a border so when it gets bad he can just skip over to safety.
Where are you at now, Feminists? Don't fancy getting drafted equally??
Ukraine problem it's joe biden problem!  all joe biden fault!  we have records last few weeks , what is joe biden did!
Time to go kick some Russian buttskys.
wAS uKRAINE PART OF rUSSIA AT ONE TIME?
Before this most of world loved putin as a hero. But now he is a murderer
I keep forgetting this is all real and not just an EAS scenario
🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦 💩🇷🇺💩
Fuck Putin and fuck Russia!
There's an idiot name Putin sitting in his comfortable room sending other idiots to fight for him. What a crazy idiot
putin public butcher
Now, we know that nato is nothing..
That`s Ukrainian Army camouflage! - Are you out of your minds?! That`s not Russian tank - that`s STRELA-10 in UA colors! Professionalism 10/10 BBC so proud of you.  Edit: By the way -  the story about the garrison of Zmeiniy Island is actively promoted in Media, how they heroically defended the island to the last man. President Zelensky even awarded them posthumously - but the funny thing is that the entire garrison of 82 people is alive and surrendered.
Lol
Why didn’t you show the video of the tank driving over a civilian car with an old man in it???
May God look after the people of Ukraine, that peace may be restored in their homeland.
HEADLINE: Russia Invades Ukraine: World Sends Hopes And Prayers...🙄
My heart is broken  Let the world be a peaceful place🙏
Stop saying THE FULL SCALE ATTACK. Are you kidding? They are using at most 20% of their forces lol. This is a elephant stepping on a peanut. Anybody fighting against russia is just dumb.
Looks like they are cleaning up the corruption...
Russia does not have such military equipment
The West said we are behind you then ran
Will we see another Holodomor? Or russian soldiers will give away flowers and candies... Idt so.
Dictator Putin is a stain on humanity
NATO,USA & Their Allies did  A Mission Imposibble Job in Iraq,Afghanistan,Libya & Syria.
Here in Russia we hate Putin and stand with Ukraine
Now Putin has his low hanging fruit.  And he can have them.  Try the Baltics next Pacman.  See what happens.
We are all to blame for paying our TV licences to this shambles that spent so much time trying to grab our attention on be it anti Brexit rationale/Covid hyper scaremongering and D Street supposed parties... When at the same time this was brewing in the background for years...
If I would be in Ukraine I would set booms and have a parameter and wait to have the enemy Inside and boom their ass
Damn, for real, Ukraine is not ready for any wars, they don't have a sufficient army at all
When Russia does this they are breaking “international laws” but when Israel does this to Palestinian innocent kids and civilian it’s not a problem then. Don’t sound fair to me 🤷‍♂️. Carry on Russia 🇷🇺
The most sad thing is that we the NATO contiries, only watch. Its a scandal, and we will never be able to look into the eye of Ukrainian people again.
Love & support to Ukrainian citizens.
at least cut Russia off of SWIFT, I'd rather be cold and starving than for Ukrainians to be left without international aid.
UKRAINE IS COMPROMISED BY AN AMERICAN PUPPET REGIME THAT IS ONLY IN POWER AFTER A MILITARY COUP. UKRAINIAN PEOPLE DID NOT ELECT THE CURRENT REGIME AND ARE NOW TRAPPED IN A BLOODY WAR. MAY ALLAH SAVE UKRAINIAN CIVILIANS
I will never forgive our UK government for allowing this. I hate being British now.
Break out the Karl Gs. We should  have sent 1000s of those. If they take the city it's far from over..and now they have to kill the civilians  or care for them. Let's see. The army is to small for a face to face battle with Russia. Make them come for you in defence...
There is a place reserved in hell for him.
This war has revealed NATO to be a paper tiger and the leaders of the NATO nations to be cowards.  Neville Chamberlain-type cravenness will only lead to further aggression in Europe.  They are all unfit to their tasks.
Why isn’t Europe sending troops to Ukraine?  This is so infuriating. Putin is a bully and right now he does whatever he wants cause we ain’t fighting back.   Sanctions aren’t gonna stop bullets and tanks. And if we sent troops there to fight Russia nuclear war won’t start. Putin wants to bring Russia back to glory through any means, if nuclear war starts there won’t be any Russia to bring back, and he has two daughters.
Long live my friend putin
Where are america and nato ?
Sergei Lavrov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia, do you remember the fate of the Minister of Propaganda of the Third Reich, the Nazi Ribbentrop? Remember, please, and compare yourself with him ..
Yo that bus driver just trying to do his job man. Move your tanks out of the way jeez.
I'm sorry to say this but i think the Ukrainian president is stupid. All of these could be avoided if they didn't resist. We all know that they can't defeat russia and asking for help in the west is useless. The West or US can't do anything cuz there's no ties b/n them and they can't deploy their soldiers.  Praying for all the soldiers and citizens of Ukraine. It's a very sad day.
Америка же не хочет ,чтоб так происходило в Вашингтоне,тогда заткнись и молчи в тряпочку.
Men? Da fuc? Where is the quotas and affirmative action now?
2:45 that's an helicopter almost being shot by RPG btw, only the timely released flares saved it from disaster. A few seconds later you can see a long trail of smoke being left by missile that narrowly missed and flew past it. There's a good quality video with a much better view on internet, just few seconds later about 7-8 helis were shooting the shit out of that hill and nearby surroundings due to this threat.
Great news the murdering for 8 years is now over that killer have to run away into the nazis cos lord puting is about to take him to justice 😎👍🇷🇺
Love Russia.🇷🇺
NATO is full of shit, they said they would help and now the russian army is entering kyiv and the ukrainian army as no help and no military aid.... Only Estonia send some weapons... FUCK NATO
I love Russia 💞💞💞💞💋💋
War. The most terrible thing in the world.  This is the very beginning of the end.  3rd World War will erupt after this. China will be next. Unfortunately we cannot do anything, we pay taxes and we out ppl in Power.  I guess we are really a virus in this beautiful planet. All we did in less than 10.ooo years is wars, genocidal atrocities and destruction of the environment. Extermination of species and the creation of a system where the strongest and corrupted rules the masses.  No wonder recently the billionaires started a space race in order to leave this planet. They know something bigger and terrible is coming,
Stop war,
Pray for Ukraine 🇺🇦 🙏🏿
That guy has balls to stay, not many would
Let’s go Russia 🇷🇺 make Ukraine a good country. 🥳
what happened? didn't we give them javelins. anti tank missiles.
Xaxaxaxa lie lie lie
Это не российский танк дебилы , как вам врать не стыдно, лживые СМИ, это украинская техника , которая размещается в жилых районах , прячась за простой люд, по учению ваших трусливых инструкторов , которые так же обучали терраристов , и все что происходит сейчас в Украине, виноваты вы, потому как вы и ваши действия привели к этому ! А правительство Украины марионетки ... Мнение мое и не обязательно правильное !
I will sacrifice my life for putin
Respect to their president for not fleeing the country like a coward. If he doesn't make it, I hope at least his family remains safe.
The USA and its NATO stooges are to blame
Mother Russia has the right to defend itself
Look the bright sight. This has to happens sooner or later. And the Sooner it happens the less lives lost.
One tank solo is not showing Russian armoured “vehicles”
NATO tidak bertanggung jawab,gara2 NATO makanya ukrayna di diserang Rusia.mana bantuannya meliternya.semua negara melihat sekutu NATO cuma bisa memancing masalah saja.jgn MW jadi sekutu NATO.ngx ada bantuan militernya.cma berani menjatuhkan sansi saja.takut SMA Rusia.contoknya ukrayna dibiarknnya saja sendirian ngx ada yg membantu
Russian failed there special force operation, Russian army looks in bad shape. And command structure is even worse. Maybe rest of Europe can take many Ukraine refuges, lets open our doors for them!
wuhan virus wasn't enough for human lives?
if Ukraine follows neutral policy,  This war not happen. western provoked Ukraine and finally betrayed by them Ukraine must learn from Switzerland.
Men aged 18-60 are forbidden to leave. Citadel of Ricks: Nobody leave everybody stay. Nobody leave everybody stay. Nobody leave everybody stay. Nobody leave everybody stay. Nobody leave everybody stay.
GRAPHIC❗❗Patrick Lancaster goes where no Westerner will     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0180KvDIeo
Damn didn’t even put up a fight lol that was easy
Stop the war , rf people need to protest
Wow in only 2days russians almost won i thought Ukraines would be able to hold for 2weeks atleast
Geneva convention says we do not assassinate another countries leader.  Russia agreed to this and the US took saddam hussein and had him killed by Sheeites. Who had killed his parents before.
Wish we would help..this is not right
So sad 😢😢
Fuck politicians.
BIDEN IS THE WORST PRESIDENT EVER AMERICA HAD THE MANUFACTURING OF CORONA VIRUS COVID-19 BY RUSSIAN BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES CHINA HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT,,,,,(((((AMERICA, EUROPEAN INTELLIGENCE NO LONGER A SUPER POWER))))))
Can western media be trusted?
Is this that kind of diplomacy that people expect? The Western diplomacy and almost around the world ,talk too much ,seem to live in a world of their own ,cut from the real world ,seem they seek only to be elected then it's not the electors business. Lots of Mr and Mrs know it all on the media playing their game. But as it is ,game is over, the EU is an organisation of bla..bla..and the world is watching. What next ..the  UN security council,Davros...and so on and so forth..the same story all over again
I hate u NATO... U r not only powerless but also a lair
Putin is present day Hitler.
Thank you Russia!
god bless putin, evil nato plans has failed and the game changed, a better new world order coming soon!
Reverse evolution
what is happening to NATO?.  Ukraine got that courage to be firm in front of Russian pressure because they thought that NATO is at their back. Now that they are into this mess with Russia, NATO distant themselves, as Zelhensky said, " just watching from far away". They are bunch of cowards...
Russia occupied Ukraine in 12 hours.What a military doctrine
nato sent army right now,,ukriane in your plan after ukriane dying your want left us fuck offf,
I hate government war
It's a terrible World 😥
Love Russian troops missile attack
Taiwan 🇹🇼  next ..... don't trust Nato just they talking nothing else
Really that easy
War is not the way to show power.. Childish Putin😂
Don't throw your life away. You can't possibly stop the might of the Russian army, are you kidding. Run while you can. Idiots.
Disgusting
All people think the same .. i would taken the opposite lane which is empty. Its a fallen state do w.e you could do to leave.
Putin’s only goal is establishing a new USSR, nothing short of that.
That war plane was Su 27 of Ukraine Air force. Shot down over Kiev.
how can we sit by whilst our governments continue to discuss these matters and take no action?! If Putin wants the world he will get it if we keep allowing these monsters to do whatever they like with little to no consequences.
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Bared from leaving the country sounds very democratic to me
War leads to nothing. Putin should have stop the war. May GOD help him.
Ukraine is a god blessed country.please keep it safe.sure about russia
This is As bad as when Nazi Germany invaded Poland
I hope Russia crumbles to the ground! To hell with Putin
Ngl, This aged like a fine wine.
I had a dream running and hidding from drafts. This is a fricking sign
Liars..... it wasnt Russian airplane or craft. It was Ukraine mistaken shotting their own plane down and crashing into apartment block.
I think this is the beginning of the end for Putin. He tries to save his stupid, unattractive regime by "exporting chaos" outside his crumbling country. The "Soviet Union" continues to fall apart, we have seen it in the Ukraine, in Belarus. He seems to think the end of the Soviet Union was a series of mistakes Gorbachev made, a problem of flawed leadership. But it was not - and the collapse still goes on. His regime is a dead end, simply a negation of the West and nothing more. The Bolsheviks had an ideology at least. From Putin´s recent speech one can see that his ideology is just absolute rubbish. He is a man living in a fairytale world.  Time is on the side of the Ukrainian people. You will eventually prevail. History is on your side. Good luck!
Its a big lesson for every country in the world that America and EU is not trusty allies they always leave their friends as left ukrainians
Just curious does Ukrain have a military? Did they fight back?
Russian Nazis committed a crime against humanity and international law.
donde esta la defensa de la OTAN los dejaron solos
Vive la Russie vive poutine
Hey trump supporters what would trump do if his boy Putin wanted to take over Texas ? 🤔  I'm just curious  Well I do know Sen. Ted Cruz would run 🏃‍♂️ to Cancun
Need to start calling Putin, Pacman.  Waka, waka, waka, waka.
So Russia havnt taken anything they planned to, or they have?  wtf is going on with the reporting on this conflict?
You call this a country of peace banning men from leaving its country and trying to force them to fight?
THANKS UKRAINE EXPOSED NATO & EU.
I dont understand..why Ukraine 52 million people and their soldier let Russia tank came in Kyiv just 1 day ??  Where is Ukraine soldier ?? Where ??
Only men barred to leave? Where tf are FEMINISTS? Doesn't that work here ?
Coward NATO
0:40 friendly fire. It was a Ukrainian Su-27
Moral of the story: NEVER TRUST TO USA
I LOVE RUSSIA 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗 Fuck EU
Mark my words this is the beginning of world war 3 Any country that dares to attack in this time when years have gone for achieving peace They only want war
They're doing a better job than the US. The whole city would be flattened if that was the US.
Feeling helpless….
Ukraine is just like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Libnan etc. NATO invaded peaceful countries repeatedly and killed millions, formed Puppet Governments. Might is Right. If NATO justified as invadors and occupiers why NOT Russia ?
Great, great,cheers.Make it fast russia. Flatten the land with ur nuclear.
If they have entered Kyiv, then the war is over already for all intensive purposes. Good job Biden, good job Germany. Give more thoughts and prayers.
Putin chose this war but Biden and Democrats funded him.
they should of fortified the city weeks ago.
So innocent people must die for the egos of the rich elite? I guess that’s just humanity.
The B.B.C. is partly funded  by the British Government.
This is an example for other countries don't trust NATO and stupid usa Russia give up for Cuba crisis but America " in question"
Yes, even though Putin is the devil, he trained his army well. A little more than one day and his troops are already fighting in the suburbs of all the main cities of Ukraine. Only the divisions of the German Wehrmacht at the beginning of the Second World War could compete with such a speed of advance. But at the beginning of the operation, the number of manpower of Russians and Ukrainians was approximately the same, although the advantage of weapons and experience among the Russians was overwhelming. In my opinion, the goal of this military campaign is not so much to subjugate Ukraine to the will of Moscow, but to show the West and the United States the real strength of the Russian army. I think that many American generals are now scratching their heads and realizing the rather low quality of the weapons provided to Ukraine to provide worthy resistance to the lawless Putin.
Having an armed society is so important
I'm sorry what? So all I've heard for the last 5 years is about equality and men and only men between the ages of 18 to 60 are bared from leaving the country?
Illegal immigrants will take this as an opportunity to stay in countries that accept refugees 🤷
Putin is slowly becoming new Hitler, he must be removed from power before it's too late.
We pray for you all the people of Ukraine love and prayers from the Timorense  ( Timor Leste )
Russian soldiers lost the first Chechen war, the death toll was tens of thousands. They are still remembered as a nightmare. During the assault on the city of Grozny, they lost thousands of dead. And in Grozny there were then only 400,000 inhabitants, while in Kiev there were 4 million inhabitants. Kiev will become a coffin for Russian aggressors.
oh look another load of bullshit, they didn't hit car or person driving around it only two tanks?? yeah..... bullshit
To fight for a piece of land and die for some political ideologies is stupid. People should never have to be forced to do that while the politicians who give orders drink some fine whisky while watching the whole thing on television. Soldiers who want to fight must be well paid and do it freely. I hope Putin gets his ass kicked by someone but on the same time I’m thinking at the poor people who can’t leave Ukraine because they are between 18 and 60.. that’s stupid. War is stupid.
Putin would be stupid if he didnt think about this after engaging with Ukraine.Of course,the man came prepared. Sanctions would not really do any harm at all on them,the man came prepared. I think this is Putins way of knowing who is really his ally and enemy. Think before you decide remaing countries of the world. Russia will be knocking on your doorstep if your leader choose the wrong side.
If you want an independent country you have to fight for it.  Ukraine didn't.  Done deal.
Это украинская техника
Nato send more sophisticated weapons
Why is nobody helping Ukraine? Seriously, wtf?
Terrorists. What did you expect from people that started WW2 along with Hitler? Shooting down civilian aircrafts? Well,they will end as they did in Afghanistan. Crying back home
Russia going to take over Turkey next. Might not be this year or the next decade.  But Turkey is next. This goes back to the promises Britain and France made to Russia to get them on their side during the Great war(World War 1)
BBC's news coverage of developments is so bad. Need a different type off reporting for a war
Russian tanks be like, where Zelensky at??
as soon as the evil from the Clinton era is removed life will be wonderful.
If someone wants to pay me $10, I'll take Poontang out!  Kick Russia out of the UN!  NATO, grow a set of balls!
LOL what a bullshit! Single "Russian" mil vehicle desperately trying to find its way on the streets of a hostile city... do you even believe this  shit? these vehicles are Ukrainian ones, trying to retreat
The international community does not exist
Yes war
This bus driver is seriously committed to his job.   Much strength to all Ukrainians!   I am embarrassed by Germanys failure and weakness to fully isolate Russia from Europe.  A small financial blow for Europe against trade with a ruthless nation lead by lying war criminals.   For moments like these, the European values were established and more and more they seem like nothing but wind.
As a Vet, this war makes me me feel very angry  and genuinely upset, these are innocent people, lives torn apart unprovoked, all because a tantrum child lost his viagra.  I wish I could fight and be apart of their defence.  I wish them all the best and they prevail.   Marty's died and made on an an island and 450 Russian soldiers over powered, Ukraine won't fall.
Go Russia ! Take no prisoners !
Is Putin fighting because he had divorce? Is mens in Russia fight because they have 60% divorce rating?
Fuck russia
The United Nations supposed to be attacking Russia because they know that Ukraine can not defend itself all the whole world is just watching like cowards remember Hitler did the same thing they all just watch what’s wrong with the world
THE CITIZENS OF UKRAINE FIGHT ALOTS OF WEAPON DONATE BY THE WEST
It surprises me that a huge number of Ukrainians are in favor of this invasion and of reuniting Ukraine with Russia in general
NATO is the new Oh I See (OIC)
Ukraine is to be taken over by zionists! Russia is trying to save Ukraine.
In Russia you don't get to choose who will run your Country and if you complain or show opposition you are either put in jail or killed. Now Putin thinks that it is okay to rule another Country the same way. The gangsters own Russia and now they want another Country.
Where are the patriot missiles? Where are the advanced anti-tank grenades? The West never bothered to help the Ukraine with effective weaponry. In the end, the West sent some equipment and anti-armoured vehicle weapons but too little too late. These were flown in, put in warehouses for distribution (why not dispensed immediately?) and then blown up by Russian air raid as the first thing the Russians did when they attacked. Europe is a worm, militarily, and a snail politically. Laughed at all across the world. Jeez what a self-sufficient criminals (like Orbán), rank pussies and laid-back idiots (virtually all the rest of them in spite of their rhetoric they do nothing to contain the Russians), we have in power in our 27 European nations.  No wonder extremist groups are blossoming.
Ukraine any% speedrun 2022
marvelous
This is unacceptable madness!😑
This was one Ukrainian anti-missal tanks . They using it in occupied areas to cover them self and expect Russian won’t hit them in the return . Shame Ukrainian soldiers, use own citizens as shields
Not even a couple of buses trying to stop them, maybe it’s welcomed….
Vladimir = 2022 version of Hitler, what a Despicable man.  Stay safe please everyone of Ukraine 🇺🇦 xxxx
Ghost of Kiev is my hero
russia girl on boy
Europeans are so lazy and incapable that they outsource their security requirements to the US.
Pray for the civilians,,, but Ukraine doesn’t stand a chance. I’m nice the hard targets have been eliminated, Russian will rollover the entire country.
Whats happened to Covid BBC ?
Ukraine is 2022's answer to Czechoslovakia in 1938.
EUROPE and U.S.A will help, just like they did in WARSAW 1939...
It's those poor children all you so called leaders from Putin to Biden and Johnson etc should be ashamed of themselves.
The US can stop this war.  All the US has to do is say no NATO in Ukraine and everything is over
Trump is probably salivating wishing he was a dictator like Putin. After all he did call Putin's invasion "genius."
Did Ukraine even bothered fighting back?
Where is Gretta to say : How dare they !?!? XD
Time for the insurgency. UA Armed Forces should melt into the population. Place civilian clothed anti-tank & anti-air units in and on top of buildings. Take pot shots and coordinated hits. Consider all comms compromised, go old school. https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=-9_eElOuMAo&feature=share
Joint Forces Operation reports: Russian invasion situation❗ #stoprussia Today, at noon in the area of Belovodsk, Ukrainian soldiers gave battle to the Russian invaders. Our units broke through the positions of the invaders and consolidated their success with a counteroffensive. Having suffered significant losses, Russian units are fleeing the battlefield in the direction of the Russian border.
Our prayers are with Ukrainian people and especially for their President for their safety. How can a small country defend themselves alone with a mighty Russia.
The crisis is very unfortunate and all blame is on nato and western countries who are selling demoNcracy. Let alone the beautiful countries whom are entitled to choose how they should be governed. Seems like people sitting under pantagon are really who works under pentagram .
The west is hypocritical and so is everyone who supports them without recourse to obedience to international laws and United Nations rules of engagement. The hypocritical west and the rest of ignorant world pretend not to know that Ukraine government in Kiev have killed over 20,000 East Ukrainianians in the last 7 years. Why were they all silent?  Secondly, Ukrainian Government in Kiev refused to implement United Nations supervised MINKS AGREEMENT, yet in the last 5 years the hypocritical west and their partners in crime did nothing about it. They acted as though the lives of millions Eastern Ukrainianians does not matter. Is it because they are ethnic Russians or because we all have to hate Russians for their boldness in standing up to western hypcrisy and their potentials?   When NATO with America invaded Lybia, Iraq, Syria Venezuela and Afghanistan after lying to the world that they possess weapons of mass destruction, they killed millions of people, looted and pillaged these countries, all the hypocrites who are now ranting about Ukraine territorial integrity all acted ignorant.   Yet we are not talking of what NATO did in Kosovo and how it destroyed Yugoslavia. All their evil actions were swept under the carpet and they have continued to pretend like these things never happened, all in the name of democracy.   To make matters worst, this HYPOCRITICAL west and their ignorant supporters, supported the overthrow of a democratically elected government in Ukraine in 2014. After western instigated overthrow of democratically elected officials, Eastern Ukrainianians who opposed it were bombed to their eternal destruction but all these pretenders to democracy were dead silent.   Supported by United Nations charter on peoples right and principles of self determination, Western and Eastern Ukrainianians declared their independence from Ukrainian and the response from Kiev was more killings and imposition of all manners of wicked measures on them. The government in Kiev even stripped them of their Russian culture and language by imposing Ukraine language on them. Ukraine Government continued to  kill them despite the fact that their declaration of self determination is supported by United Nations charter.   Now for simply recognizing Eastern Ukrainians right to self determination and supporting them to take control of their declared territories, the hypothetical west is busy engineering unimaginable propaganda to further cement their lies. They no longer talk about the undemocratic overthrow of an elected government of Ukraine in 2014. They are no longer talking about how Eastern Ukrainians were massacred by Kiev for rejecting that undemocratic overthrow. They no longer believe in the United Nations agreed principles of self determination which these eastern and western Ukrainianians based their exit from Ukraine on, and which they were originally champions of. They no longer talk about the minks agreement that was supervised by United Nations and which the comedian president in Kiev refused to implement. They no longer talk about how Eastern and western Ukrainians have been massacred and bullied in the last 7 years despite agreeing to abide by the United Nations supervised minks agreement. The hypocritical west and their shameless supporters have refused to talk about how we got here but have continued to push their propaganda with the support of their compromised mainstream media who also played major roles all the massacres and destructions the west carried out in many parts of the world.   Even with Israel invading and occupying q large portion of Palestine till date, with the support of the west, they still shamelessly have the boldness to condemn those that have not committed anything close to the kind of atrocities they are known for all over the world.   Yet they claim to be the conscience of the world and leaders of democracy even when they are known to have acted unilaterally on many occasions against United Nations resolutions. Even when they have declined on many promises made to Russia and other countries in the times past.  This is nothing but hypocrisy of democracy.   Hence, I support the effort of Russia to go into Western and Eastern Ukraine to save lives and uphold the peoples right to self determination. Russia has done nothing wrong but to come to the aid of oppressed people of eastern and western Ukraine and to teach the comedian president a lesson on how to abide by an agreement.   Ukrainian president and the west must be held responsible for refusing to implement MINKS AGREEMENT and for acting along with those who are led by their hate for Russia for their refusal to come under the control of the west. Ukraine comedian president is stupid for playing such a role and must take responsibility for the outcome.   Especially, Europe must be ashamed of herself for ever remaining a puppet in the hands of blood thirsty defense industry players who are always stoking crisis across the globe in order to sell their weapons. Europe is a disgrace to the world, they have let God and humanity down by helping to propagate lies and enabling bloodshed across the world. Especially as those who claim to espouse Christian Values, they have failed by engaging in lies and blood letting. They are now a big stain in the moral conscience of the world. What they have shown to the world is nothing but hypocrisy of democracy.  No amount of Western propaganda can change the truth, only time will reveal all things.
Bbc , the poison behind all media news.
Oh where oh where are the United Nations peacekeepers at a time like this? They’re in Canada chasing down those pesky revolutionaries with their cans of diesel and bizarre bacon.
I got $20 on Russia now
Dont poke the Bear
I think that If the Russians don't take Kiev in 48 hrs this whole thing is gonna backfire. Putin expected the president to run and just walk in and set s new pro Russian government. Everything that they've done was to take Kiev as soon as possible, hopefully they can hold it.
If I was a betting man my money would be on Ukraine.
And at the same time public transfer takes place. That is possible because the Russians have promised to prevent civil victims as much as possible. Unlike the Ukraine military which is shelling the cities in Donbass and shooting everybody including public transfer. Since 8 years Ukraine military is shelling the Donbass and NOBODY has take notice about that!

What happened to the javelin tank killer
Hail Russia
Although a symbolic loss for Ukraine, its good that they abandoned the city and probably hurrying up defenses on the west Bank of the Dniper.
What he said was your free to think, just as long as we agree with it
God all you people in the comments are annoying as fuck. You dont actually care. Stop virtue signaling.
Damn, that's fast! I hope they're good at guerrillas tactics like the Middle East and Vietnam.
Ребята жгите их!!!
🕊⛪🕊🛐
No mentioning Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria. I know of dozens of other conflicts around the world where at least 200,000 people died. Nothing against the people of Ukraine. I hope it doesn't get that bad for them.
Ben Wallace with his big ass stop talking and go fighting!!!!
My heart sank
it's a bit rich for the Americans and the Europeans to condemn any sort of invasion...don't you think?
Hit with a javelin
THIS TANK RAM A MOVING CIVILIAN VEHICLE!!!!!
Ha ha ha to all the idiots of the west it is unbelievable how dense you have become he he he
THE UKRAINE FIGHT BACK WITH RUSSIAN AGGRESSION
Lesson learned If countries are able, they should go Nuclear.
Вы просто не представляете как нам страшно
The UK and the US have let down Ukraine... Classic response from the west 🍻
Ukraine is a figment of the Soviet imagination, that is being used by NATO.  It has, and always will be Russia, same people, except for the immigrants from Germany.  BBC...can we recall Ireland?  And the Irish are a different people than English with a different culture and language, or how about Scotland?  What is it called,...the United Kingdom?  Hypocrites and war mongers the British are.  NATO is an imperialistic tool used against sovereign countries -- Iraq, Syria, Libya.  The legacy of White European enslavement of Africa, Central America, India and China.
Napoli 2 - 4 Barcelona 😙😙😙
Everyone is talking about peace children's safety but these people's never said a words for Afghanistan Iraq Syria Palestine Kashmir yamen Libya syria Children's #Hypocrisy on its peak.
Lies - it's Ukrainian
Plss Save all people in din civilians guyss?
Stop running. Take up arms and defend your god damn country.
Bus driver: Expect Delays
Bad precedence now what will stop china from attacking taiwan. Satanic putin showing his might
So much for allies and their discussions.
Our Leaders need to wake up fast. This is just  example of what is coming next. If NATO doesn't gear up fast . What is there to stop this form spilling over in to other countries Putin wants to take over.
Yawn!  And BBC Propaganda...LoL..
This war is European elites and North American elites fault! Ask why kids of American politicians got high paying jobs when they weren’t qualified in Ukraine? What labs are the Russian troops going after and why? The people will yet again suffer because of politicians and elites doing shady BS!
They are screwed , nobody will go help them , only harsh words and sanctions, nobody wants to mess with Russian, all countries are pussies, including the us, I can say this, I served 21 years in the military, and watched us go down hill.
I can see even if Ukraine is captured and rule by Russians by this means, Russians will never know peace.when the people say they don't like you,you can't force yourself on them.this is common sense.
Украинцы сбили собственный самолёт по ошибке. Аэропорт остался в руках российского спецназа. Киев уже блокирован с запада.
Give 'em hell, Ukraine! You can do it, we're rooting for you!!!
Ever since biden stepped in as president he made america unreliable and seen as weak to its allies as evident one disaster after another. Afganistan now ukraine. Whats next taiwan? . . Biden should be removed from office. He is the weakest and the stupidest president of america the world has ever seen. Biden i hope u read this. You are a coward and a traitor.
fc ukrainian nazis
Resurrect Churchill, you all "politicians" from the "free world" are just pathetic, faded caricatures of once leaders of the world...
They still only count as 1!
More false BBC news. Note the bus casuaully driving by the UKRAINIAN army vehicle. If the Russians wanted to occupy Western Ukraine they would have done it by now. The US instigated this conflict, like it starts all wars, It pushed the Ukrainian Govt to join NATO knowing Putin would rightly not accept this. The US did not accept Russian missiles in Cuba back in 1963.  The Biden administration is collapsing. it needs to distract the people from domestic events. The USD was about to implode due to inflation.  The Biden administration had to instigate yet another war to push investors to run to gold and the USD  as safe havens, thus preventing a collapse of the USD currency. The US started the Vietnam War by the concocted Gulf of Tonkin incident. It started the Iraq war by the myth of the 'weapons of mass destruction'.  it started the Afghanistan War by saying Bin Laden was hiding there when he wasn't. Now the US has instigated this new war in the Ukraine and the stupid, gullible people believe the false news media that it was Putin's fault. Putin warned the US many times that Russia would not accept the Ukraine joining NATO.
Just so everyone knows, Ukraine and Russia have the same armored vehicles, this could be Ukraine's Army moving out.
It's super odd. Ukraine military seems to not be around. It makes no sense because they have a military with tanks and aircrafts
another afghanistan....now puppet of usa will run like ashraf gani
Where are the cities defenses?
America is totally responsible for this situation.
Please sanctions now on Russia. Send weapons to Ukraine.
Putin is evil

Ukraine also needs to stop their ego
NATO'S disorder that's all about it
Does not have the distinctive z marking on it… so may not actually be Russian
All of the russian troops obeying these orders are cowards! Every last one of them!
Its one thing to be there but another to keep it
Where are US and NATO forces
💔😭
how in the heck do you count casualties on both sides?
Please stop war..things about publice.😥😥😥
看来英国脱欧太对了！
Pull your finger out man Ben! We need to stop this ASAP!!!

These are Russians in Ukrainian tanks. They were eliminated shortly after the video was filmed.
European's Ass burning..🔥 🔥
The people of Northern Ireland had to suffer with the scorge of a foreign army for 30 years, the Brits have no authority to talk down to other nations.
O My! WOW sooo devastating!!! PFFFF!! This is the scene DAILY IN GAZA!!!!!
In 2019 my parents brought 3 kids over from Ukraine to live with us for a few weeks to see what our culture is like, they never had a mc Donald's before and they loved it, bless them. Bless Ukraine.

Does anybody know if war crimes apply to civilians?  Like if a random civilian gets a hold of a soldier and brutalizes them, woyld laws against war crime apply to the civilian
U only show news, cowards
Good for Russia and china. Americans are deranged.
Ukraine was an independent country . How could one snatch its independence ?. Amazing . Powerful could do anything. Weak can be crushed despite of this proclaimed civilised world . Weakness is itself a crime.
Were two all civilians
kremlin Idiots  they blind and mentaly sick   predators
EU got what it deserved.  100s of thousands of Ukrainians to take care of who beat feet at the first shot fired.
I think if the government initiates a conscript, then they themselves have to also personally go and fight!
Ukraines fault... Fault of GenZ Ukrainians
The fireballl was a Ukranian plane shot by friendly fire
Is it Ukraine 🇺🇦 not capable of fighting using there own military? Do they have defense system like for air strike? I’m just shocked that they are easily invade 💔 #PeaceOnEarth
It is so sad to see Ukraine attacked while NATO is doing nothing to defend them.
fuck usa u created this
Davai davai
I don't understand  how russian armoured personnel is just moving freely around their capital it makes no sense, they don't even seem fazed, no gunner is visible on these trucks or tanks I'm no military expert but even vietnam did a better job and went on to win the war and they were outnumbered, outmanned, and primative in terms of technology at the time, the media is obviously not telling us something, I wouldn't be surprised if Russia has organised a coop.
Russia needs to take control of all Ukrainian  territory soon as possible.
This is disgusting to watch 😡😡😡 #freeUkraine 🇺🇦
Israel did worst to Palestine than russia did to Ukraine
Ukrainian tanks actually - more lying propaganda from the BBC
BBC reported that Russian disregard civilian n attacked them. BBC reported that Ukraine President n his family were captured n executed by Russians on the command of Putin. Only BBC reports true news.
People act like they never seen war before
USSR is back. The WEST  is helpless.
I don’t get it! NATO, you need to step in, you need to support and help these people! Air support, start there!!!
Shame on Putin. He’s like an abusive husband who would rather murder his wife and children than see them happy with another man.
EU and NATO: Good luck Ukraine, we sanctioned their banks, but not the important ones. Sending good vibes.
How do we know that’s not Ukrainian tanks?
Correction: A Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet was shot down over Kiev not a Russian Jet as erroneously reported by Sky and BBC. BBC and Sky twisting facts as they go along but for what it's worth i guess you have to create a narrative  to keep Ukrainian and Western morale high.  Understandable.
Tomorrow its game over
Russia is really showing how much of a 3rd world totalitarian they are. Big boys with their big weapons. 3rd rate army at best... this is pathetic.
Don’t worry United Kingdom is next NATO WONT SAVE YOUR ASS.
Where is James bond ???
Behind Ukraine’s curtain 🇺🇸 is controlling them.
It's simple, we take out putin and the problem is solved
I cant even imagine seeing my classmates and older friends going to fight. Mortifying.
Keep hitting them with Anti Armor weapons. Strike and move positions
very badly every was washout no freedom life our India will be support the country we all prayers forthe people of Ukraine country have a nice  blessing Jesus day .
How can someone be so evil
I hope that all of the invading Russian forces are destroyed or captured. I believe in the Ukrainians and they will resist.
I hope Ukraine will be destroy soon as possible such a Syria 💀💀💀💀
We need to help putin is not going to stop at ukraine
Oh.
Am in Swaziland and praying for Ukrainian people and their families i know very well how iy is not to be safe in your own home.....
wheres captain price when you need him
This is result of US is always provoking others even now doing hegemony to China. This is really bad habitat. US should take all these cost of war on its back. From Korea 🇰🇷
Come on all democratic countries stand up and support Ukraine this is injustice.
Putin is like..........thanks for the weapons NATO.
If the Russian people Stand up to hitler (Putin) this war would have stopped. Or do they also want war? If so, I hope Russia will be wiped from the face of the earth…..
This man’s actions and thinking is the embodiment of a caveman mentality trying to live in the past. When he is done on this mindless rampage the precious land he wants will be destroyed and worthless.
submission is sense..to save lives,as freedom is only second to Life...
I love how overnight brits have changed their prounounciation of kyiv.
Plesse attack back russian
Stop war save earth save humanity 😭😭😭😭for the sake of human race 😭😭😭please 😭😭😭😭
(warning: Im not saying I suppourt this war)     this war (it cannot be called war. its more like a man hunt)  is the proof that cold war never ended. this is one of the  consequences of that. russia had to do it, and it did it. it felt tightned by the other forces and it did it.  firstly we have to understand that countrys doesnt works with emotions. countries works for their best interests. I think everyone has to search why they did it (not the bull s. they said but the real reasons, their hidden interests)    in the end they had to do it and they do it and I think ukraine should resign instead of resisting because russia is a grizzly bear and ukraine is a rabbit in this situation. other countries are not going to help and russia will never stop. if they dare to do something as putin said they will land their nuclear missles. and nobody wants to try out that if hes lying or not because russia has potencial to do that.
The biggest issue that not many understand that Russia treat to their military personnel in different way than European countries. While European countries try to eliminate own army losses, Russia can send as much as possible people without any hurt. Unfortunately, ANY country even in NATO cannot accept this challenge. If Ukraine falls, the next will be Moldova, Georgia, other small countries of Warsaw Pact. But next time the price of european glory will rise exponentially with more invaded territories. That is exactly what Putin wants
Putin is a plain criminal!!! We let a man kill innocents and literally take a whole weaker country and we did NOTHING !!! All nato countries should've just nuked him all at the same time without warning as he did !!!
I feel sad about what happens Be truthful, when usa lose 100 soldier you speak no only one injured but without prove you speak about other ,the truth all what happen because of you the west
Didn't Ukraine have an army?  2nd only to Russia in all of Europe?  Guess not.
Ukraine is as bad as Poland.
Typical Fake BBC news
Israel everyday attack palestine pbb and nato just silent no send troops
BBC, CNN AL FAKE NEWS LONG TIME REPORT CORONA LIES
men ages 18 to 60 cant leave. where are the feminists now ?
The world looks at it by tv, we are shit
Just remind Russia that US, France and UK are Nuclear-armed nations as well.
BBC U R so lazy , Al Jazeera reported it several hours ago .
We afghans  and Ukrainian paid a heavy price for trusting American and nato
those arent tanks
How stupid Ukraine is...🤬 Who told him to fight with Russia.... American?🤣 They will never come up to Safe Ukraine... Everyone knows American Hippocracy
NATO IS GAY AF. WHERE'S NATO. NATO = NO ACTION TALK ONLY.
This is what happen when you choose a comedian to be your president 🤣
EU and USA must save Ukraine now!!!
If Trump was on charge, he'd impose more serious penalty on Russia. The point is SANCTION might be a long-term solution but NOT an instant remedy, in fact blocking the trade and money is just gonna piss Russia off.
Good. Now show video of US tanks entering Bagdad.
Russia save Donetsk and Lugansk.
Me living right next  to ukraine border
It looks like Ukraine's army didn't even put up a fight, looks like they fled with their families!
The plane shot down was s Ukraine plane. Get your facts straight or are you presenting falsehoods?
Palestine kids everyday saw rocket and pbb nato just silent
Ukraine shouldn't have aligned itself with biden administration.
War is the answer when our democratic elected  leaders don’t look at the big picture, Ukraine has been abandoned, prayers to the poor people who have no fault on their own, it’s simple give Putin what he wants and stop it!! It’s better to have peace with compromise then war about who’s right !
Being from a country that was invaded by its neighbor in 1990 in the middle of the night, we all feel how terrifying the situation is for the Ukrainians. Tomorrow February 26 Kuwait celebrates 31 years since its liberation from Iraqi forces. Praying for this aggression to end soon.  Our hearts and prayers go out to everyone in Ukraine, stay strong.  🇺🇦♥️🇰🇼
This will be the WW 3 if we don’t watch it like three bible said look at our President and other things going on prayers this will stop🙏
Mr Blair caused 2 million innocent iraqi death without any accountability. The world is sick of natzi zionist evil creatures that invest in killing innocent people. ENOUGH 😡😡😡
Why has "everything changed for Europe"??? How does this impact a housewife in the outer suburbs of Paris, for example? This invasion is evil and barbaric, but really, it's enough with the exaggerated attempt to make this a threat to BBC listeners in South London!!!!
If BBC is saying it must be then ,lol
The aircraft shot down is Ukrainian. Shot down by their own. There's pictures of the debris and it's painted in Ukrainian colors.
In this difficult time, we should all unite together against Ukrainian criminal regime. They must pay for what they've done.
History repeat itself cause of human nature.  EU, US and the rest of the world stood to watch as WW3 will soon begin.
Ukraine is going to get over run in a week
This is the time when they need a bunch of RPGs, ATGMs. Easy target.
Sleeping 🐻 awake...time to look for food
There you have it folks. He said Georgia and Ukraine would join NATO. That's why they invaded them both.
We just following orders
When USA does it , its fine . When Russia does it , its not fine .  I am not supporting any , just pulling out the Hypocrisy and double standards.
l Think it's about time they Surrender
This is the first I've heard of Ukraine winning back a site with counterattack, great news! Hope they can push back more today, and that NATO announces forces contributions.
Russia is gonna use cluster bombs 💣
ukraine invited russian war...it was their politicians fault.
Biden’s strong words soft actions.
I am sorry for people in west and America, you have weak politicians and leaders, you lost it Putin, they left Ukraine alone, and this results other countries to think twice about their relationships with west.
BBC lügt und mach propaganda gegen Rusland!!
Now is the time for improvised weapons and a guerilla war against Russia military & civilian installations and equipment .In the spirit of the occupied Vietcong.Resistance..
Sorry for the Ukrainian people, but following the EU brings disillusionment.   When Trump was president, Russia was close to being friends with the United States.  it is not Russia the problem but the new government in the USA, they are the source of the evil all over the world
maybe the cocky ass ukraine government wont provoke russia any more , like they did the past decade , feel bad for the people
My heart is with the Ukraine people. Puttin is a war munger who needs taking down. Praying for all Ukraine people 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Those are armoured SAM DONT FLY OVER UKRAINE OR ELSE MORE CIVILIANS WILL BE KILLED “we didnt know it was a civilian aircraft like what happened to Malaysian Airlines shot by a Russian separatist SAM
All this talk is doing nothing
Putin be like I'm done with you guys, gave enough and more time for deciding. Now see my actions and stay silent. Yeah..!!! And please do go ahead with your sanctions, by the time I'll get Kyiv also ✌🏼🕊️
I pray for peace I don't understand the reason for it but I have two grandchildren 9 and 15 who are upset and concerned that this could be the start of a war. Why would Russia just enter another country and think that it's acceptable I pray that it is over before it has even. Began in jesus name amen
Guys, we all feel sorry and express our feelings but lets try to do something. I was thinking to raise some contributions no matter how modest and used wherever its needed for the Ukrainian families that are being forced out. Or any other suggestions if you have please let me know. I want to actually DO something about it instead of being just a spectator. I am willing to pickup the responsibility if anyone is willing to help either financially or voluntary activities. Please let me know if anyone is interested in doing more than just feeling sorry for Ukraine.
Fake. Russians tanks and vehicles got big white letter Z On all sides.  You can see that at the end of your video.
Japane might need to think, didn't Japane and U.S.A had similar agreement, U.S.A is slowly losing its ally trust with whatever agreement.
I pray for everyone's safety.
What about Palestinians?????
If West doesn't send troops, we will live as cowards.
NATO should've been disbanded after the collapse of the soviet union for European peace and stability. But instead encroach ever closer to Russia after multiple pleads by Russia to stop for the sake of their security. I'm an independent so I look at both sides of a story, after much research its clear NATO along my country America is the threat even after Russia's multiple peace and security drafts that were brushed off and ignored by NATO.
Europe threw Ukraine into war
May all the citizens of Ukraine remain safe with their friends and families. But those who are criticizing Russia for the invasion were involved in invading, destroying  I e Iraq, Afghanistan, Lybia, Vietnam.  Hypocrisy of the west at its best.
No sanctions were applied on USA, NATO and Israel for destroying muslim countries WHY?????
Europe and biden are really in support of ukraine.... yeah the message is clear...
Think what would US  do if their enemies use Mexico to threaten US influrnce or even national security ? What Russia is doing is right if you think from its perspectives? Don't forget what NATO pledged to Ussr in 1991 to do not expand this organization in East Europe. Don't put your blame on Russia alone.
Men between 18 and 60 can't leave the country and have to fight where is the sex equality now should make women fight too Ukrainian is sexist
New name for Putin, Genocidal King (GK Putin)
Every man 18 to 50 should be given a firearm and should defend their country.  Death before dishonor
🙏God save us🙏   This is crazy, doesn’t feel like reality  Zelensky needs to wake up
I hope Ukraine people are safe .. I'm praying for their good ❤️
Biden a liar.......   Hope God give them (Ukraine) strength
Shame on EU and Nato. We are really not doing much to help.
Let Putin the Genocidal king of 2022 be wiped out with his supporters of murderers
Legit Ukraine president was overthrown by west to place an anti Russia leader now innocents are paying the price of nato expansionist agenda I don't like putin but think this should have never happened
Hmmm
This would have been avoided :( NATO and U.S. took too rude attitude toward Russia. Ukraine's authority was ignorant, and Ukraine people are innocent.
Nato europe must be held responsible for any innocent lived lost im Ukraine.  The world is sick and tired of natzi zionist non stop war mashine. Stop bullying nations. You all suck😡😡😡
Why other country just watching such situation
Well looks like public transport is still running
How are they that close allready common Ukraine ffs😂
The army rejected my application last week, I'm going to tell them to do one if they try to contact me.
Nothing new here.
we did nothing and now its too late... thanks western goverments, you have fucked Ukraine good
I hope that the western civilization is ready to accept the weight of the sanctions it should put on Russia to annihilate it's economical potential. By accepting the weight I mean accepting the price that the west has to pay in order to make the sanctions be truly effective. Expensive gas, expensive petrol, delays in production, lack of different products, etc, etc.
Zelenskyy should start moving around, and address the country from a different city every day. He could multiply his strengthening effect on morale considerably in that manner.
United States of America you're government is coward
War is evil. These people are just like everyone else they have their children, homes and pets to care for. Now they are under the stress of war. Nobody deserves to be treated like this.
You can survive being America's enemy, but not its friend.
West betrayed yemen! Polarised views
какая страшная бабища 🤢
Has anybody footage on the Ukrainian artillery, defense forces?
Just 2nd day and Russia already entered kyiv 😳 The power of Russia 🇷🇺🔥
Biden is comprised, if he does anything Putin ruins his life
Damn it, I hate that men 18-60 are being held back for soldier fodder instead of being able to seek safety. I worry for everyone but, especially the boys who may be forced to fight.
Where is the actual help now?
R U S S I A ... URRRAAAAHHHHH.... DZ WAGNER
Only matter of time Ukrops. You are done
I see them I liveing there in Ukraine Kylv    Pls pin
I saw whole video this was Ukrainian tank .... Fake News
Just let ukraine into nato and jump russia until his own people uproot him
lol   such spin and dis info....jeezz
Glad to see the world is waking up. If you want zombies go play Resident Evil, thanks.
The Russian people openly opposing the invasion. So, so brave. Terrible scenes.
Do not fear God is in control 🙏🙏🙏
because of joe biden! now American it's a joke!  America lost world  leadership! joe biden need retire!
I pray for the innocent lives that they may be left unharmed.
Slava Ukraini!
Damn it's over already. That was quick. Smh. So sad
There will be an epic LAV fight at the parliament soon.
This is how WW II started...get ready
NATO and West is the main reason
Makerov
The anger wells up in me when reading most of the comments so far. Praying and hoping and sending good wishes to the people of Ukraine is about the most USELESS waste of energy I can think of. Does absolutely NOTHING for those in Ukraine but sure makes all the well wishers FEEL GOOD.   Putin understands only POWER OVER everyone and everything. The ONLY thing that will stop him is to be confronted with an OVERWHELMING power. He's not in the slightest deterred by sanctions from the outside world. By the time they take effect in any significant way Ukraine will be solidly under Russian control. I can only guess which country will become the next target.   Now Putin is threatening NUCLEAR response against any interference in his invasion plans.    NATO is acting like little yapping dogs at his ankles. Even bigger dogs, like Biden, are just barking and snarling. What is required to put an end to this criminal's plans is a precision strike on the Kremlin big enough to LEVEL IT, preferably while Putin is on TV from it, while doing as little damage outside the walls as possible. I guess the "west" could do it... a drone... or smart missile. But they won't. I predict the "west" will cave and let Ukraine twist in the wind..
God protects your people
All you can do is make Russia bleed badly . Fight for your right of self determination. This world sucks , no one will help your country  . Hit Moscow  with missles , Ukraine,  the only way you have a chance.to stop Madman Putin
It really sad but we can not do to stop it. If America support the ukraine it will be world war. I hope that this conflict well end it now.
It's pretty much over  and russians have invaded the whole country. They best surrender now to avoid further killings. In time west will bring Russia to its knees.
Come on Biden lets stand up for democracy
I love that bus driver. Not even tanks are gonna stop him from picking up passengers.
Defeat and disgrace are the hallmarks of Leftists and Democrats.
Where's all the tank weapons America sent you guys smh 600 million dollars we gave away in weapons smh what a waste of are tax payers money smfh
Props to those Ukrainians who fled to EU.  Took advantage of that opening immediately.
Meanwhile cbc says Russians in protests after Ukraine attack them???? What's real
why so easy to invade Ukraine?????
Doesn’t look like a tank， probably an armoured personnel carrier (APC)
This is the same Joker who claimed they were not going to invade Ukraine.
Ukraine is such a beautiful country and I really feel sorry for the people of Ukraine. I know a lot of people here are going to curse me for what I'm about to say here, but I simply don't care. Just by looking at the history, I'm not surprised at all why Ukraine is in such a mess today, and Zelensky was so naïve that he trusted and believed the US, UK & NATO, who time and time again have proved that they cannot be reliable PARTNERS at all, first they make FRIENDS/ALLIES and then use them for their pathetic interests and once the job is done, just throw them under the BUS. Now, why the US, UK & NATO are not going in to Ukraine to save them??? Imposing stupid sanctions will not deter Russia at all, they currently have foreign reserves of over 600 billion, and their economic partnership with China will protect them from these pathetic sanctions. Two back to back embarrassments for the US on global stage, firstly Afghanistan & now Ukraine clearly shows that US is a receding power now, and this is not a uni-polar world anymore, in fact it is tri-polar, and more interestingly 2 of the three "SUPER POWERS" are situated side by side in the most populous part of this planet, and have a very strong economic and strategic partnership. I still hope and pray that better sense prevails all around, loss of human life anywhere is just unbearable. Zelensky must, must find a way to reach out to Russia to stop further bloodshed, I'm afraid there's no other option left.
This is not a Russian tank. This is the air defense forces of Ukraine in Kiev !!!
This Russian ambassador is really an idiot and liar, thanks for your invading autocracy driving democracy out, darth vader
This is the Cuban missile crisis in reverse, the Russians don’t want North Atlantic treaty organisation(American)military bases on its borders just like the Americans back in 63 didn’t want Russian bases in Cuba seven miles from the coast of America. You can’t condemn one and praise the other.
They basically walked into the suburbs. When Serbs try to do that in Sarajevo, those armored vehicles were destroyed in seconds. Different mentality, I guess.
If anyone could remember these gang of countries sections once before in 2014 .what happened to those sections 😂 .hypocrisy on full swing  another funny line we are not send troops to ukraine.f.. hell how could u send nato troops to ukraine when ukraine is not the member of nato cant use article 5 . 😂😂😂😂😂 don’t think act on real sections now
Useless western alliance, can't defend democratic governments
The Ukraine should bomb the Russia too
Whole world Amarica, partners and Allies crying too much but you do not cry on India and Amarica' s child(I).In 1942 when your child Israel occupied Palestine , when India put jungle laws  on Kashmiries , these two bucher countries kill people like hunter kill animals when they kill muslims that time why do you keep your mouth shut, eyes close and you do not take any action but when Russia taking action for the self defence policy, will not allow Ukrain to join Nato and will not allow to any country to make Military base in Ukrain, it is Russia's policy for their country.you and west have the double standard ,would you like freedom of speech of course you do.
NATO needs to help in one way or another. Air lift supplies to the Ukrainian army or something. We can’t just sit by and watch Russia destroy Ukraine. Have we learned nothing from history?
Ukraine’s sovereignty ended in 2014 when the US overthrew its democratically elected leader in an illegal coup and installed a puppet gov’t. At least 13,000 people have died in fighting since then in a war fueled by US.
War is avoidable if only Western allies respect Russia demand for security,, instead they intimidate, instigate, muddle Ukraine government to fight Russia,,pity Ukraine you're now the sacrificial pawn of US, NATO to contain Russia...wake up Ukraine wake up....
This is the start of the new Soviet Union Ukraine is just the start
The American GOP and Republicans and Putin stand together in the senseless murder of innocent Ukrainians. #MAGA
Ukraine is not weak. This fight has barely begun.
The ukranian prez is responsible for all the sufferings. His Nato bootlicking practice backfired. Wasted American dream🤣🤣🤣
Shame on USA , NATO and UN for abandoning Ukraine. Why sign agreements you have no interest in implementing. No one is talking about the Minsk agreement.  This is all because America wants to set up military bases in Ukraine and Ukrainians will die for American interests shame!
Leftist Democrats project weakness, stupidity and cowardice.  Obama lost the Crimea, and now, Biden will lose all of Ukraine.
So that's all the resistance Ukraine can offer.... shameful
Ukraine is fallen!
Wars- Created by US, for US, but blamed on others.
Where the fuck is big mouth american british and European union,??? Pussies all these countries
It was a Ukrainian plane. SU-27
Where is US and UK , Who are responsible for this situation.They give only lecture but do nothing.If you such a responsible country ,do something.
God help us
NATO means No Action, Talking Only. All scared. UN means Useless Number.
They did not take back the airport it was Russian soldiers bad news
I hope the Ukraines receive some of the luck the Finns had during the Winter War when they were confronted by the enemy and similar odds.
Bust out those NLAWS and Javs, its anti tank time.
Ukraine army has been collapsed ?
Like people in Libya, Iraq, Syria....so sad!You need to help Ukrainian....or you only talk about this!
The west has given high hopes to Ukraine and its people.  Come on, join EU and NATO and we will protect you.  Now Ukraine is attacked, all the west could do is to impose sanctions on Russia and left Ukraine to fend or defend itself.  Terrible on the part of the western countries.
2:09 This action will definitely make them not want to join NATO. 🤪
and nary a shot fired in defense. Putin just took Ukraine...that part's over
My 2 cent is. Politics happend people did not agree like always... media blowing up situations. 2 leaders need to talk this out make the deals that need to be made and no one needs to die...
Where is..Ukraine army?
Please don't harm innocent civilians because they did nothing for this conflict 😭😭🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
1.5 day :)
The West and America are weak and traitors They represent strength over weak countries They will not appreciate Putin...
Kick Russia out of SWIFT now.
Wow they are taking over Ukraine fast
Why not show the Russian tank deliberately running over a moving civilian car?
Well that was quick shit Russia
18-60 Marshall law what's that mean they can't leave and have to take up arms
The world is wicked all they do is sit down and watch you suffer
it WAS unthinkable....but...remember wokies: TRUMP was colluding....that's why this all happened under the mean tweet man, oh wait. Secondly: i thought you wokies didn't believe in borders??? So what's the issue? Finally wanna admit the orangeman wasn't so bad after all? or....are ''offensive'' tweets worse than a nation being invaded? BWAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA WE F**** WARNED YOU FOR EIGHT YEARS OF THIS. YA DIDNT LISTEN. BWHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA hilarious!
Good by Ukraine.
I have a suspicion that Russian forces have been granted an easy path into Kyiv but are about to discover getting out may be impossible.
3 more days and ukrane will be lost
1. Mother Russia in Bible (1 thru 7).     2. She is a [Rat].     3. She is Cornered by Western Politicians.    4. A Rat Attacks When Cornered.   5. Neighbors Suffering, Now.   6. The Rest of us Suffer, Next.    7. Mother Russia Destroyed By Heavenly Father, Eventually.     Regardless, Individuals Must Be Born-again To Go To Heaven !!!
Dajcie ukranie  rakiety Stiger , Bić soviet bandytów !
bloody useless cowards
USA you have done what you wanted to do, I wish USA and England have dead, I wish Russia will f,,,, k your a,,,
You can see Putin is avoiding casualties on both sides.  That is why his objective is to seize the capital, power grids, transportation routes. If he wanted to beat Ukraine into submission by attrition of the civilian population he would do what Germany did during ww2 to England or the USA did to JAPAN and bomb cities.  Even when USA attacked Iraq or other countries they killed civilians by bombings.  It happens.
Hoax
It’s so sinful for Ukrainian President to summon for all the males from 18-60 to go fight and die for nothing. Stop your ego, stop killing lives !!!
NATO and USA brought this
Only the USA and UK have god given right to wage war on poor countrys and overthrow legitimate ellected governments?
STOP PUTIN!!
Don't forget to mentioned that 18 000 automatic rifles were given to anyone holding Ukrainian passport in Kiev. That would surely stop the tanks and not provoke any maradeurship. Bravo, Ukraine!
Western Europe really have not learnt a thing from WW2. WW2 started exactly like this when a part of Czechoslovakia was annexed by the aggressor.  Then that proved not enough, the aggressor then invaded Czechoslovakia while the rest of Europe stood still.   Had everyone stopped the aggressor of WW2 earlier then the scale of WW2 would not be what it is today.  Here we have the same playing out. Complacency on the annexation of the peninsula and no aide when the aggressor is unsatisfied and invades another country in full.   Shows all this WW2 remembrance amounted to zero lessons learned.
Yeah BBC You do nothing! Brits wtf
Already recycled ❤️🇺🇦
These tanks aren't stopping here. The Ukraine is just a refueling stage for the next few years. I've been invaded already (different continent). Stop hand-wringing and start doing real exercises.
This is how China invaded Tibet and the only nation that stood up for them was India and ended up losing the war to the heavily armed Chinese military. Hsitory will show that there was someone who stood up to defend the innocent and helpless.💪💪💪 stand with Ukraine
Sad news today
Inefficient and knowledgeless countries believe America and NATO in future
NATO: They will be responded decisively. Putin televise warning Also NATO: Yo just send em prayers, and grab me that popcorn while you're at it
wtf.... Why are there so many fakes????
Lesssgooo mother russia
Let them come all the way in and then cut in behind them. Then you’ll have them trapped
Europe needs to unite and build one united military, we are too divided.
The city should tear out a section of the median on that highway out of the city and divert some traffic out of the city on 3 of the 4 lanes that lead into the city.  In the U.S. that's what is done when people evac for an incoming hurricane in our coastal cities.
That's what you get when you rely on America. America gets what they want and you get their enemy's Tanks. America then retreats back to their safe home over the Atlantic and you deal with the mess they left on your door. Don't let 'murica in your house.
It’s not fair, poor people
Thanks to the US and NATO- this is what its been like everyday for most middle eastern countries. Yemen is still going through a genocide led by the US. Zelensky is a NATO puppet who brought war to innocent Ukrainians
What happened to gender equality 🙄🤯
Shoot it.
Russia is going to win and China will take Taiwan next
RAMBO PLEASE  HELP 🙏
I remember live footage of American tanks heading for Baghdad in 2003. The western world called it "liberation". Shortly before, the US had bombed cities and innocent civilians. This whole mess was based on a single lie presented to the world at the Security Council.   Double standarts.
Absolutely men on both sides should refuse to fight. The people who started this on both sides are safe and far away.
Keep going Putinho
Onfair ;
PRESIDENTE YANQUI ASESINO EN VES DE MANDAR VÍVERES DE  ALIMENTOS HACER QUE LA ECONOMÍA DE UCRANIA PROSPERE LES MANDA ARMAS Y ENCIMA ESTABA A PUNTO DE ENVIARLES ARMAS NUCLEARES
US & NATO cheated Ukrainians. That commedian president is useless got screwed by them. Russians can't allow NATO to encircle. I would do the same to protect my people. UK is same breed as US. Cheating world for generations.
And Russians call Ukrainians brothers. Suree... because this is what brothers do.
willing to go out on he's shield now that's a true leader
I don't believe anything the UK Tory government says regarding Russian casualties. Their propaganda is as bad as Putin's. Hopefully peace can come about for everyone's sake
What a bullshit… no russian in Kiev… if russian were in Kiev, it’s would be not 1 tank… Russian in Luhansk and Donetsk helping people to get freedom
If only the Ukraine had oil, US troops would have been there to defend... And all of the US lapdogs too.  The Ukraine is fighting alone The Ukraine is bleeding alone  The Ukraine is dying alone   Which side will they end on once they figure out that the west only sends them sad smiles and prayer emoji?   #PocketSunflowers
"the full force of the Russian military was released" You do realize that Russia is actually using less than 15% of its military force in Ukraine?
All bragging of Ukraine regime is gone. Bloody cowards, now all are hiding in parliament buildings. They wanted proof of russian withdrawal. They wanted to fight till last man. All hoax. It was simple, their joining of NATO would cause a security risk to Russia. Instead of talking this out and maybe chalking out a common minimum programme, they wanted war. Well, they got one. Short and simple.
The Ukrainian troops
well played EU ,brits , usa . slit the lamb (Ukraine) and throw in front of devil( Russia)  . 1- where are sections those were promised including swift 2- omg yes we did sections Russia on their unfinished gas pipe line to 🇩🇪  .also there is no gas in that particular project  3- sections on Russia billionaires those who are already under sections well before this started  4- china is very bad etc now only country could presumably do anything is china ahhh 😂 5- Australian politicians we will sections Russia end of March we still considering   who is hypocrite here all above countries or poor Ukraine ppl .  Russia invaded already but we will sections Russia 🇷🇺 soon in 2030 😂
So where is the ukrainian military??
oh noooooo
When US and allies bomb other countries. Freedom and roses of democracy. When war gets closer their home. Violation of human rights and precious lives matter. Nevertheless loss of lives is sad and I condemn the military action. I also hope the western hypocrisy ends. God bless.
I would advise you people to move to Africa because this is the start of world war III
Why don't they fight back ?
We heard British tanks going to defend Ukraine or what ?
Help Ukraine, save Europe! Ban Russia from SWIFT! Protect Ukrainian Sky! Send NATO to Ukraine! #BanRussiafromSwift #CloseTheSky #SendNatoToUkraine
In my opinion, Ukrainian President, Zelenskyy is to be blamed for the war and the sufferings of Ukrainians.    He should know very well that it’s futile and foolish to challenge Russia and because of his personal ego, now Ukrainians are suffering and eventually, Russians will also suffer because of the sanctions.   Just don’t join NATO and there’ll be no war.   Now, Zelenskyy himself is being targeted by the Russian military, being the #1 in the kill-list, is it worthwhile??? It was all so foolish.   Zelenskyy should immediately order his military to ceasefire and go home, just like what Putin said. That will save lives on both sides !!! It’s not worth the fight.   Then, Zelenskyy should escape from Ukraine before it’s too late.   Of course it’s the intention of America and NATO to instigate and provoke Ukraine to challenge Russia.  All that has happened can be described in one word, ‘selfishness’.   Now, just one stupid move by Russia, America or NATO, will spark WW3.
DESPICABLE *** Ukraine police holding Ukrainian citizens at gunpoint trying to force them to to turn back to take up arms even though they know it would be suicidal. This is a direct copy of Hitler's Germany at the end of WW2 when Hitler and his mob forced all Germans including children to fight to try to save his life. Ukrainian government committing unescesary mass citizen casualties by not capitulating and negotiation of treaty. Beggars belief!
#theghostofkyiv is the first fighter ace in decades and is likely the man responsible for shooting down the reported aircraft in the capital. Happy hunting Ukraine
Mr.SELENSKY is a Comadian, did he smile now??😁 Bravo Mr.Putin!
bro how are we just sitting here watching these communist pigs get away with this. DOWN WITH RUSSIA
https://youtu.be/L0RfzUbPAx0 send putin this lol
They forget to mention that we have a bunch of Bio labs in Ukraine making nasty stuff. Also it seems that Ukraine is used to wash money from the dirty elite
Putin win the weight of the world 💪🚀🛬🛫
Poland held out alone against Nazi-Soviet invasion in 1939, Ukraine held out against Russian aggression in 2022. Ukraine is not yet lost. Long live Ukraine !
💔
A Ukrainian air defense plane, not a Russian one, was shot down over Kiev
isnt it ironic ukrane has no oil like kuwait 🤣😂
Westerners and US are full of shit . All you know is instigate war when it comes to reality you run away like you did in Afghanistan. Countries should learn they are not going to save you it’s all about their interests. Ukraine is another victim.
Rusiannn.....stop war for Ukraina
Most of videos are fake from 2014,,,,
Covid no longer an issue no?
Europe is repeating the same mistake they made in WW2 , thinking they could negotiate with Hitler , History repeating itself . Ukraine has been betrayed by the west. Ukraine needs at the minumum military air defence . NATO is useless and the the UN is pointless . NEVER trust the EU and never trust AMERICA. Ukraines mistake was the EU and the west . Putin is a dictator and a bully and should be treated as such . My disgust is not so much what Putin has done , ( becuase most of us with some common sense knew this was coming ) , BUT in  Europe and the west for betraying Ukraine.  God bless Ukraine and its people.
At least the Prez of Ukraine is not leaving, unlike Afghanistan president, who flee before the Americans.
Prayers for the Ukrainian people 🙏🙏
Yes, and I am sure the coach service at 1:38 only had been stopped by a tank as Putin had given the order to check on the tickets of the passengers.
I hope people ( except the neo Nazis) surrender to Russia peacefully. Russia loved Ukraine more than NATO. Let them live as one nation. Honour, loyalty and respect.
Whats the point of having USA as an ally when they don’t have the balls to defend their friends.
NATO please, HELP UKRAINE! 🙏🙏🙏
Blitzkrieg. It's really effective. The key here is to prolong the war. If you prolong the war, Russia will lose. I bet Putin knows this.
How to abandon friends; B. Johnson - we give military support don't worry. Be patient Ukraine. Then - oops sorry. Too late. You are surrendered.
Это техника Украинской армии.
Am supposed China not takne advantage of this timing it shows America wont do shit
Uraaa
WW3 HAS COME
Nato is pussy
Can't somebody help them for God's sake! Innocent people are dying. This breaks my heart. I hope that someone will put a stop to this. Stay strong, as I am praying for you.
Europeans supplied weapons to ukrain before Russia attack but against Russian mighty weapons Europeans weapons useless
Только вот на кадрах украинская зенитная установка
Realistically speaking, it's going to be a rough fight for UA. The west will not do anything meaningful as they have no signed obligation like an alliance or something. Ukrainian will be forced to prove themselves like Vietnamese once were. Face it. UA will have to pay the price for independent this time, with no fault of their own.
Россия вперёд

The west shuld seport Ukraine from begining or just stay fuck back
Who wakes up one morning and decides this is the day he  takes over a whole nation. This ain't COD people this is real life and it shows the world is losing the "idea" of a world with "love". Theres less of it these days and shows how much we should actually create more love and not hate in the world. Spread love yall
👍
The 3 day war ,will be a good title for this war
How long before we fInd out thIs wasnt in ukraine and not 2022?  Fuck off warmongering BBC
Putin should get the death sentence for every life he's taken away with this invasion.
Где вы все были когда геноцид на домбаск был умники идите домой и пейте чай вам не победить Росссию
So y Dident you show the full video of that tank driving over a fleeing civilian car ????
Blame NATO. Trying  to surround Russia by sneakily legal means they implemented with their major objective to add Ukraine by adding a clause any country can join if there is a majority acceptance by NATO allies. Why didn't they just invite Russia.  Putin is right you don't want Ukraine to have missles with a flight time of 5 to 10 minutes to Moscow.  Remember the Cuban missile crisis.  Putin should retaliate and put missles there now.  What would be the flight time to Washington?  The USA between Cuba and itself have anti missles bases like on Guam where it is considered owned by the USA but inhabitants are not considered US citizens.  With NATO this has already happened with China.  USA leading the way has put missiles on bases in the Pacific Rim surrounding China.  Some are in Japan like Okinawa where the population there don't even want the base.  One world power by military and economic is what NATO is about.  Look who it's members are.
Don't have another way without war ? So sad see Ukrainian children and civilian 😢
Too much brutal from Russia
May peace and harmony prevail in Ukraine
We support Ukraine.
Idiots, this is ukranian forces, there arent letters Z or V on the body
Ukraine you are stupid. United Nation are fuck you up.
Is Britain sending any rainbow warriors?
What is NATO doing, why can’t they send more support on the ground
Why isn't NATO doing anything more for Ukraine? Sanctions going to do nothing to Russia!😒
Это украинская стрела у российских вс таких нет
Prayers for Ukraine 🇺🇦 🙏 ❤️ 🇺🇸
Maybe you should also put UK into emergency?
Ukrainian soldiers were in a Ukrainian residential area, they shot down the Russian plane, the wreckage landed in the residential area, the residential area was destroyed, it's not Russia's fault, right?
The last missile, which was shown in this video, blew up a few hundred meters from my home where I'm living now.😐😟☹
Bravo Putin.
A person I met about a year ago or so on Facebook lives over in Russia. He's been sending me information and this morning he sent me a photo of a news clip showing Ukrainian citizens that had been shot and killed in a vehicle and their bodies laying beside it and it looked like there were kids in the vehicle also
Thinking of the people of Ukraine 🇺🇦 💙  and also the animals and pets ♥
As in any war, the citizens suffer the most.
Everything changed in Europe 8 years ago when the world ignored Ukrainian aggression in Ukraine against ethnically Russian Ukrainians and genocide .......stop lying the Russians are putting a stop to it  https://www.youtube.com/c/WatchdogMediaInstitute/videos
there's film of Ukrainian civilians  taking up arms,  don't think this will be a short war if the Ukrainians want to fight . Stalingrad Grozny warsaw ghetto , its one thing taking a country the size of Ukraine its another thing holding it , we need to send them more weapons anti tank anti aircraft . Russia will lose tens of thousands possibly hundreds of thousands of people and will very likely need to call up people to fight in this highly unpopular war .
Russia has entered kyiv, Ukraine must be more alert
Russia Great country with balls
Thank Biden
With no traffic Russia will reach the parliament in 10 minutes
Wheres the Ukrainian army??
🇮🇩❤️🇺🇦
Lavrov is a cold hearted pig, when Russia's losses get too high to carry on Putin and his cabinet criminals should be ousted by the Russian ppl then face criminal charges for every murder and crime they've committed since being in power.
The West is toothless. Liars. Never trust them.  Ukraine should have kept its nukes
So based on what the Russian foreign minister said, this is actually a war against NATO?
So sad😢😢😢😢😢😢🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 Ukrainians.
Ukrain zrc strela 10
See , this is the world we 're showing to our beloved children. These children , they have to study in school with their friends by this time. Look, where they are. This war is a nightmare for the rest of their life. A painful life. Is there no other way to end the conflicts?? You politicians , don't call yourselves educated. You low minded peoples. I really wish the leaders of Russia and Ukraine would go for Fist fight between them only and not to involve these innocent peoples and soldiers. My heart is raging and crying for these kids and peoples😭😭😭
Where is USA now. Only blew the fire and now out
Russia has the right invade Ukraine. I am sorry for those terrified children and women but i think the ukranian regime is responsible for their suffering!
This son's of B... Russian gave them plenty of time..
If civilians were a target at least 10000 people wouldve died already
History repeating itself again cold times for the world ukraine now whos next ?
World please help Ukraine! Why you scared of Putler?
Fuck russia..
Uraaa🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Russia needs to be put in there place.
Lord🙏🙏🙏protect 🛡️Ukraine🇺🇦
Ukraine Foreign Ministry "the enemy is suffering losses"
This is the Dems fault. All that Russia bad talk and having an American puppet government in Ukraine right on russias boarder was a ticking time bomb.  These idiot politicians are alwa screwing my over regular people all over the world.
NATO’S promised ukraine 🇺🇦  we will be with you, so y they don't help them? The answer is Russia is too powerful for NATO’S, and its not like Afghanistan,iraq, Libya Syria Yemen and you name it. Ukraine 🇺🇦 made the greatest mistake in their history by trusting NATO’S propaganda, and this must be a big lesson for those eastern European countries who are not joined NATO’S
For fictional news, I'll explain... This is not a Russian tank. This is a Ukrainian tank. All Russian military equipment has an identification mark "Z"
Disgusting, in a world where possibilities are endless we just want to invent our own doom as well.
Chii Bhai Mr USA and Europe with big mouth helped nothing 😂
That's not a tank.
go RUSSIA go
All soldiers should lay down their arms , what are they fighting over that justifies taking a human life ? we just spent 2 years fighting covid giving it the big we are the world united together as a human race , a month later & we are blowing each other up wtf ?ain’t we ever going to change? We need 1st class people real leaders across the globe & not greedy seedy psychopaths
What a load of bs.  Everyone knows mi6 runs bbc.  When you going to explain how you knew building 7 was going to go down?  Compare this hodge podge of cgi, a common traffic jam and one apc to footage from the war in chechnya.  You are a fraud
Great Russia’s abt to have even more land. Eradication of the communist gov gon b nearly impossible without world fallout but they need to be eradicated. Evil minded war pigs. Democracy id say probably  is the closest thing the world has to being what humanity is supposed to be. Free. Not the opposite. Communism is a perfect example of what the world shouldn’t be. In my opinion. It’s evil. Our government ain’t perfect either but it’s a high step up from communism shit
Sanctions won't do anything as China ministry says it will maintain "normal" trade relations with Russia and Ukraine. China also said they will  view the "Ruble's" value the same as before the invasion matter what the US market views it as it blames the USA for  the invasion.   Someway somehow the United States made Putin invade Ukraine for some reason I guess.
There just letting russia come right in lol nato needs to start fighting
Force will only make an enemy out of Ukraine ad they eventually will become part of NATO... Russia is not giving a good example. China will do the same against Taiwan. This is not a good example for a stable world. Having said that NATO should not be pushed to borders of Russia either.
good job Russia now take over Israel too
The Russians fighting back the American agressors like the Soviet fighting back the Germans in world war 2
Next in line, Georgia,Belarus, Estonia,Lativa, Lithunia and Poland.Putin is on his way to make complete USSR.
Putin = Hitler
The government is so sexist Preventing only men from leaving the country
The fact is behind this war there's a west and their tricks and fingers on Ukraine and they are paying now 👍
Glory to the Russian army. Ukraine will surely be denazified. 🚀🚀🚀
Why cut the clip of armoured vehicles entering Kyiv which shows Russian tank driving over a civilian car driving out of danger… miraculously the man survived he was elderly and assisted by locals….
This is a Ukrainian car that ran away from the ambush they fell into. Russian columns enter side by side. Although for you we are all Russian is not surprising.
Have peace! -Jesus Christ
Where the hell r so called Ukrainian  Heros?
Ukrainian army give walkover to Russia 🇷🇺
Damn this is sad my thoughts and prayers are with the Ukrainian people
That is not Russian tank! Stop spread bad news! Ukraine deserve this. NATO make this to happened!
Where is chest thumping BoJo? The US and Europe shouldn't have given Ukraine false hope and made them negotiate with Russia before this blew up. If you look back Russia had no problems of Ukraine joining EU as long as it's territory was not used as a launching pad for an invasion of Russia. But sadly Nazis took over and we know the rest like killing of Russian speakers in Odessa which led to the Donbass revolting.
Please give us the chance to survive 🙏                                 Ban Russia from SWIFT! Protect Ukrainian Sky! Send #NATO to Ukraine! #BanRussiafromSwift #CloseTheSky #SendNatoToUkraine
Înfricoșător.😭😭😭😭😭😭
Nobody gives a shit. Fuck Ukraine.
It’s called a decisive victory.
Putin kill Ukrain nacist!
That’s a suburb?? Looks like a commie housing project. Russian invasion is good for ukraine. Putin will expel the grabbler president and NwO Zionist’s
Success Russia...
I only one I am missing is trump people down played him but his enemies were scared of him.
This is what asked 4. Bring the big guns out
Wherever USA and NATO war must happen and that country becomes yard
To brate Putine do Londona i Njujorka za sva zla koja su pod izgovorom humanosti naneli mnogim neduznim ljudima
Hopefully allies will be there asap❤
I’m with the us soliders as they protect us and Poland.
Ukraine is certainly not a Neighbor of Russia, Ukraine is joining the enemy. Russia supported.
When NATO bombed Seria, When US bombed Iraq, When....
Poor Ukrainian government acted slow
We did it Joe 😂
I hope Ukraine Prevails...praying for Ukraine🙏🏾
Long live Russia 🇷🇺💖
So where is Ukraines army?
we literally can see 1937’s policy of appeasement .  What Putin really wanna ? He wanna invade the Europe ,hilter called living space
Oh Putin will burn in hell
Not that I like war or anything but they should have at least evacuated it's people long before and setup IED's all over OR SOMETHING jesus there is still civilians walking about and public transportation wtf is this?
Why only men have to fight? Why not women or others?
General Stonewall Jackson once said War is the summation of all Evils but sometimes it is necessary! K All the ASEAN brotherhood countries are hoping and praying lets give peace a Chance! Together with the Pope the Catholic Vicar of Christ on Earth! Calls for cessation and immediate ceasefire! On both Russia and Ukrainian forces! K
Why not show the footage of them running over civilian cars? Get the message across
NATO US ,they are so disgusting china and rusia,let's attack now we can't wait any longer time now it can be north korea also attack south korea,we need to attack now from comunism
Europe wanted no part of Muslim refugees, I pray the sentiment is deferent for the people of Ukraine 🇺🇦
Ukraine missile defense system shot down it's own jet
The rest of the world is too comfortable to do anything
Those are actually part of recon units.  But whatever.  It's over already.  Ukraine didn't fight.  Just let them walk in unopposed.
How ironic that today is the anniversary of EDSA People Power and right up in the globe there's ongoing war
How can the Ukrainian government trust anything the russians say? - "Peace in our time?"
One tank by itself in the city. That's some brave russians. I don,t believe it
We miss you Trump
Western media: "The Russians have abandoned military targets and are focusing all their attacks on hospitals and schools!"
Run, ukrainian nazis, run, Russians are coming!
White on white crime anyone?
Stop War
Where are Ukraine’s military?
I thought Ukraine would put up more of a fight tbh
Why not just report , Putin Does what he likes,
America is lying https://youtu.be/J3s06SsRUZU Please take a look🤦🏿‍♂️😔
we need to send all the rappers that wanna drill over to Ukraine so they can drill all they want.
Support them , Ukrainian need your help , act !!!
That's was quick, hopefully no civilians lost
Is it just me or it really feels like the advance towards Kyiv shows that there's basically no Ukrainian army around it protecting...seems like Russia is just walking in without anyone showing any resistance.
why did they talk about it, they should just admitted them. We should have told Russia  one boot on Ukraine soil and they are in NATO, and Putin would have done it. Talk is useless with Putin.  He was bent on this. The Olympics were over, he'd made his agreement with Ping, the Russian representative was the monthly president of the UNSC (nothing like kowing in advance what they were going to do), so he made his move to invade, it was always invasion. we need to quit dilly dallying and acting like we don't know what's going on and what' coming next. Wishing won't make it go away and it's to his advantage - he'll take all the delays he can get.
Putin ❤️
EU and nato giving people False hope has led to this . Russia was never going to allow the eu or nato on their doorstep
Polands next! It’s just a habit
On a roundabout system, does a tank automatically have 'right of way'? It's not a Russian tank anyway, its a Ukrainian Strela air defense system - gotta love the depth of fact-checking of reporters these days...
Romans 10.13. whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved. Jesus is lord.
A strong USA President would be handy at this point.
Why did World ignored Georgia president's warning in 2008? "gEoRgiA bOmBEd, sOUtH oSsETAI" same story Putin is using right know against Russia
You didn't really care so much when Ukraine was bombing its own people, many which include ethnic Russians. You didn't care that for almost a decade Russia had tried to negotiate an end to hostilities in Ukraine but that they, along with Nato never even tried to fulfill their own agreements.
How is a Ukranian SU-27 fighter jet shot by their own defense system a Russian jet?
Nothing to worry.... American led NATO will provide Ukraine with the same support NATO provided to the people of Afghanistan!
Russia must prevail and demillitarize Ukraine.
damn russia this is sad hahahaah u r scared of nato hahah well be scared of nato
Utmost irresponsible: these are not tanks, merely armored vehicles in number of two. A diversion action, probably hijacked Ukrainian gear. Kiev is free and functioning quite well, but it is easy to incite panic. Exactly as the Russian aggressor intends. A big let down from BBC, another one after your FB profile spammed with tabloid-style content. Get yourselves together, You were a trademark of exemplary journalism some time ago.
Hero disease on all of his equipment to stop fake news like this
Zelensky such a fool..! You had all the time to do not bring you people to the war.. Now are you lookingfor a guilty...! The unic fool Guilty Are YOU..!
Why ukraine dont fight back?
Now Ukraine become a birthplace of terrorists,,,,enjoy NATO!!!
Giving up nuclear power to impress the west didnt age well for their future
BS there is no Z written on it that is a Ukrainian tank
It is not tanks.It' a armored car
peace sign for russians🖕f y
I think the others countries are hesitant to join forces with ukraine because they know Putin doent bluff he wil go for them too...ut doesnt look good at all a nuclear war might be be provoked .
Slava Ukraini
WWII & NOW ? As war is fought it takes charge And events spin out of control. The madness of men can alter the soil which nourishes the roots of their soul.  Many things will forever change Far more then wished to be. As the wrath of war starts to destroy Those things we fight to keep free.  War is the greatest plague of man, Religion, state and sanity. Any scourge is more preferred Than the one which disables humanity.  When war breaks out, boundaries change And all who die are a token Of the rage that must run its course Before words of peace are spoken.  It’s not a priest that gives us our freedom of religion And it’s not a reporter that gives us our freedom of voice. It’s not any judge, lawyer, politician, preacher or teacher But the blood of a soldier that has sacrificed by choice.

And are sire its ukraine ?i heard that the media don t know if its ukrain or RF and i don t think that if it will be RF transporter with vsokl rocket it will go alone
I am from Russia and I don't want to be here anymore and I don't want to have anything with Russian culture after that. It is total madness which will destroy Belarus and Russia itself.
https://youtu.be/PJbilH2P-mk
Nepal is with Russia 🇷🇺 😍👍
Ukraine army put up almost zero fight.  This is over.  USA wants a refund on our investments.
Adolf Putin
I think western countries countries could avoid such scenario. Russia wait eight years to solve the problem with dialogues lastly rejected the legitimate demand of sequrity gurenty to Russia.          Western countries blind the action Ukrain band Russian language and to speak though 47%of Russian speaking people lived in Ukraine. It's a Nazi regime. Western countries blind about continue war with their own people in  Ukraine.          I think Russia have no other option on their hand.
Where is america and nato? Biden just bluffing at the beginning. Taiwan have to learn from ukraine
Now USA and NATO is trapped hahaha 🤣🤣🤣
Putin invaded Ukraine because he knew the West was weak & impotent under Democrat Joe Biden & Harris plus the weak leaders in the E.U. The weak USA  pull out in Afghanistan only emboldened Putin to act. Next China will invade Taiwan within weeks not to be outdone by Russia. Wasting time on racial stupidity has weakened the USA to the extent that it can no longer be depended upon like the U.N.
5 4 3 2 1 . Keep it up and you'll piss off Poland and it wont be nice ! I'm sure you're getting close as Ukrainians are crossing the border asking for protection !
I hope Ukraine 🇺🇦 citizens will be vigilant...
WAR DOES NOT FIT TO THIS ERA, IT IS MEDIEVAL. MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN FOR EVACUEES
Joe Biden and the cheating Democrats are corrupt weaklings!
it wasn't a Russian aircraft.. the Ukrainians shot down a Ukrainian SU27 with its own air defenses. . priceless.. endless border forces and police surrender to Russians..
Don't mess with Russians
Anyone else excited for Fallout 2023?
Hopefully Russia will end this soon and arrest morons from Kiev government
Largest ground-war in Europe since WW2...
I want feminists to fight for the right to fight. I am waiting for them. No offense intended. Only pure equality expected
Distraction people! Distraction from what??? What are we being distracted from. This has been deliberately set in motion!  What's going on behind this WORLDWIDE distraction??? Putin is being used as a PAWN. The Globalist knew Putin would do this if they pulled the right triggers. He'd have no choice but to act. That is what the Globalist want. Putin is vehemently against GLOBALIZATION of the WORLD.   I laugh at some of the comments of Putin. It shows that many are asleep. They SEE, HEAR, and FEEL only what FAKE NEWS brings to them.   Follow the WHITE RABBIT in the "MATRIX" if you want to see the truth. Truth can be scary! Truth isn't popular! Taking the RED PILL will rock your WORLD! It will take you down the RABBIT HOLE.  This Ukraine thing is a POLITICAL SCAM used by the GLOBALIST to move us closer to some hidden AGENDA going on back behind this FAKE NEWS MEDIA FRENZY!  Call it a SUPER>BOWL>POLITICAL>SCAM! A MAJOR distraction (purposely created) to dull and distract your senses from what is taking place behind the scenes!  Could it be the GLOBALIST created this WORLDWIDE distraction with Russia's Putin???    Are the GLOBALIST fixing to cause a MAJOR FINANCIAL COLLAPSE of the WORLD monetary systems???  >So that they can raise up out of the ASHES a new WORLD ORDER!   Study history and see how many GLOBAL events were ARTIFICIALLY created to bring about a hidden AGENDA by these GLOBALIST. You'll be 😳 shocked!  It's time to take the RED PILL as Neo did in the MATRIX! https://youtu.be/ax2bQOZy6Sc
Dying for your president's mistakes does not make you a patriot it makes you a wasted life Zelenskyy should save the lives of these young men and accept the terms he is not even being asked to step down just not to stop any further flow of weapons to his country and to remain neutral
It seems Russia wants to surround Kyiv but not take anything else, just push for Kyiv… so that means while Russia is surrounding Kyiv, Ukraine’s military can surround them! Russia: “You’re surrounded!” Ukraine: “So are you!”
Same videos over and over on every news channel.
I'm in France, white flags are hanging everywhere.  I don't know what's going on or should I go to Dunkirk????
Putin has had free hand to do as he pleases and the timing is perfect with the "election" of Biden , the most incompetent president and worst administration the USA has ever seen. You can ever imagine this happening with Trump in power. This is shameful and speaks by itself with a democrat administration witnessing catastrophes like Afghanistan, Ukraine invasion and, in this country the rampant disregard for the south border. What is next, Taiwan taken by the Chinese? We have a demented leftists in power with a Pelosi's syndrome of wokism. Terrible for the world and USA.
Literally writing this inside the bunker underground 💀.Wtf is going on...
What is happening, why NATO and the USA don’t help Ukraine?  Why did they leave Ukraine alone against the second army in the world and its ally  Belarus? 2 vs 1. (((  USA and NATO are afraid?  They promised to help...  Iрiна Верещук - Irina Vereshchuk. "As a Ukrainian politican, I am appealing to the leaders of NATO states: As of yesterday, it's a new stage in our relations. No more room for tricky talk and enigmatic innuendos. You either do it or not. Enough talk instead of action. You still have you chance to do it right. Shut our air space, give us weapons, we will do the rest!"  “Yes, they have introduced new sanctions against Russia. But this is not enough. We are defending our country alone,” - said the head of the party, Elena Shulyak.
I blame America and its allies for this war. Because they have given this provocation to Ukraine. And for Russia, we will go for this because they gave independence to Bangladesh in 1971 and supported it with arms.💞🇷🇺🇧🇩💞
Hope they get annexed.
America is going to make ukraine NATO. so yes the usa are helping.
是时候捍卫美国和欧洲的信誉了，乌克兰把核武器废了，当遇到侵略的时候，你们在哪里？
Surrender and return to your families...  Now we see who are the smart and who are the dumb ones influenced by Washington! Congrats to the lightening and spectacular Russian operation against those who chose WAR instead of neutrality!  In a couple of days the Powerful Russian military took Ukraine's quite well organized military who received tons of sophisticated American and European weapons....  That is in contrast with American led NATO. After 20 years been spanked by Taliban Goat Herders Americans and their subservient NATO footman are defeated and flee Afghanistan is shame!  That goes 180 degrees from what we watch on Hollywood movies!
fake news as always, these are ukrainian guys in panic
Hmmmmm so Russia just drives right into the capital with no resistance 🤔
Fake news
I cant help but feel that Zalensky staying in Kyiv, while very brave, is a strategic mistake. He should think about setting up a government in exile to preserve his government and maintain the struggle should Ukraine fall as the Americans and others have suggested. I hope he changes his mind.
Fuck Ukraine!
Putin consults the Oracle: "Tell me, do the people of my country love me?" After a while, the Oracle says: "I see you being carried high above the heads of the people". As Putin turns to leave, the Oracle adds: "They are using pitchforks".
Zelensky only have God to help him..! But I believe is a litle late..!
Where are the Javelins? Do they know they can shoot them straight at helicopters? If Putin starts to lose anywhere, don't be surprised if he uses tactical nukes.
#facputin!
Come to MY door step you f***** prick
Why other countrys allow to do this.. he will come to us ... stop this madnes
‘Marshal’ law…pathetically ..Hilario’s …
Putin is showing signs of meth overdose.
Peace to civilians, victory to Russia and shame to U.S/NATO
Lavrov seems to be just as much warcriminal as mr littleman Putin..
It's just sad, corrupted upper class society of Ukraine chose the option of war. Now, innocent citizens have to flee from their homes. It's almost like a joke. Political arena should be monitored. Voters shall not forget it's representing the crowd ,not representative of the crowd. Media also played a huge role with their propaganda, now it happened, they would just update "Ah! Evil Russia finally showed their claws" meanwhile a country is facing destruction, innocent people living there have to flee for life. Sad reality.
Reminds me of the situations in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria.
Russia proved with this incident that they can feared. They steamrolled Ukraine. This is terrible.
go Russia! crush and conquer the land
ОСВОБОДИМ УКРАИНУ ОТ ФАШИСТОВ.
Rusia ,,putin ,is the best ,
Prayers for all the Ukraine innocent and animals.
Kiev*
THE NEO-NAZI REGIMEN IN KIEV WILL FALL WITHIN THE NEXT 36 HOURS.🔴
Best to stay indoors all they want is the government officials
https://youtu.be/JrP63AbapVo Jesus loves you🇷🇺🇺🇦🇺🇸🇪🇺
surprised they didnt show the footage or mention the russian tank that drove over a civilian car moving towards them and then showing the aftermath of people trying to get the pensioner out of his car by some miracle how he survived
As putin conflict with Biden and democrats now this happens, as predicted this war is start, but just would it be world War 3 next that's depend on what Biden said, if Biden shut up maybe putin won't takes it into world War 3
We are on the eve of destruction. a full nuclear war will now probably brake out now 🙏😔
Putin the new hitler
Losing the capital is nothing   Freedom as an Ukrainian is  Ready to get called russian again?
War is just a form of politics. Why some people think it is something different to routine political or diplomatic discourse. It is only western liberalism that thinks this.
Ukraine won’t loose! If they defend there cities as hard as they did during world war 2 they’ll have the Russians running in no time
God the human race will NEVER learn. And war never changes anything. It only brings death and destruction. And the worst part is that if Europe and US come to aid Ukraine, then we can expect Nukes eventually. No body wins. While leaders can live safely in a fallout shelter. I guess we can call this the great RESET!
These are Ukrainian armoured vehicles in Kyiv. Not Russian.  Why are the BBC misinforming people?
where are the feminist movements, only men are banned from leaving, are they going to insist women get banned too? Our hearts are with Ukraine on this needless and stupid war!!!
Ironically, in 1994 Ukraine gave its nuclear weapons to Russia in exchange for a guarantee on its sovereignty and security. (I believe it was called the Budapest memorandum) Of course since then Russia has found excuses to disregard that agreement.  Honestly I don't blame the Russian people for this mess. I place the majority of the blame on Putin... but I can't throw stones considering the last few presidents of my country.(usa) lmao
Ban Russia from SWIFT! Protect Ukrainian Sky! Send NATO to Ukraine! #BanRussiafromSwift #CloseTheSky #SendNatoToUkraine
Glad to hear Russian troops are getting killed.
When one comedian with no political background become president by help of USA or western support outcome is this and people suffer in the end .
Yellow bus driver went on his shift that day
Russia you are doomed
I see the propaganda is in over drive in the Wrst
so, not entering Kiev, but to the north of it. stop misrepresenting shit, people use news to see what's happening where their families are. You can't do this if you have a care for anyone but ratings. shame on you.
Brilliant go Putin take them terrorists out and get rid of that despot dictator
These are not Russian tanks, lol
Russians goes in columns, not by alone.
Proud to be Russian
Putin: I will eradicate neo Nazism.  Biden: I will unfollow you on Twitter.
Wish I was Superman. I would…
They ain’t even shooting civilians, not even ramming into civilians. What’s so upsetting? The real war ain’t even started
It’s time to completely cut off Russia economically, destroy Russian satellites and send military help to Ukraine. We know from the second world war that there seems to be no end to these crazy leaders ideas.
Where's the Ukrainian army. The Russian are coming from the North without meeting any resistance.
I can't believe that bus driver is still working.
Nice tank
Auld Killary Clinton and Biden have created a really good distraction now from all the crooked shit they are doing in America.
I just witness a Russian tank drive over An INNOCENT civilian car trying to get away. I'm speechless that Europe can allow what is Poland Invasion of ww2 2.0, where they are all bark NO BITE while the invaded country is fighting for their life only difference this time they are just saying it to Ukraine face instead of what happen with Poland where they  just lied that help was coming. You'd would think a continent that suffered TWO WORLD Wars on their soil with many families who have members that lived through or died in those wars. Countries Filled with valiant Soldier Graves who fought for your liberation and continued to do so through the cold War to prevent things like this. Many of your countries pride themselves on protesting yet fail when it truly matters.
This is US election consequences obviously.
Where  are  the  anti  tank  weapons  we sent ?
all of you that want EU to help Ukraine, you are praying for WW3, you are sick, Zelenski has a chance to stop everything, instead of telling people to fight, he needed to sign a piece of paper that will guarantee that NATO will not be in Ukraine, Ukraine should be guarantee for world peace, not a spark, instead of doing that, this clown doomed so many people in poverty and immigration, this is not a leader, this guy is a joke
Skip to 1:40 for the good stuff. Boom, boom, ha ha ha. This is awesome.
heartbreking was the bombarding serbia 1999 i was in shelter but usa aka nato killed my people + usa f..k up other countris and leave them in poverty but take they oil and evrything ,im soory about civilan s but usa come to the border of Russia,stop the war and come in dipomlatic way for solution
Ukraine you hold your own doing Amazing ‼️
Reminds me of the Taliban taking Afghanistan with little resistance.
Zelensky is to blame for all of this
Ukraine is not even fighting.
Ukrainian President was such a fool that he opposed Russia believing USA and Western nations..... Pentagon, White house,EU will jointly proclaim many condemning joint statements and hold many meetings and watch the situation closely...At the end Ukraine will be erased from the map and US and West will do their next job of fuelling other nations to fight....
Wish me luck boys. I'm hearing gunshot echoes from my position. Luckily I sent my wife and kids to her parents ahead near the border. She love this place. And I will protect what she love.   And here I thought we'd be together till old.... I hate this
LORD GOD 🙏🏽 PLEASE PROTECT AND SAVE UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS....
alpha af
Let's see how they treat their refugees in the EU. Are they going to be treated as Syrians or does race and religion really make a difference.  I do hope they are treated well tho.
WHY NATO DID NOT ACCEPT  THE MEMBERSHIP OF UKRAINE BEFORE THIS WAR HAPPENED.  BEING A MEMBER TO NATO IS A BIG FACTOR TO DETER RUSSIA.
now where is nato and usa all these should be ashamed because they cannot go to war with Russians they simply pushed  Ukraine' to hell
Putin is a mad dog for doing this he has two daughters This action will be hard on them if and when Russians get to him . Putin is a coward like his employee trump in America. Down with monsters.
Not Russian, Russians have Z painted on all equipment
Following.....
By the way, where is NATO and US ???
I like how the bus continues casually driving while enemy troops infiltrating
Where are Ukrainian defences ?
Western nations are reasonable for this war
Putin 💩
This war is over, just surrender and end the meaniless deaths from ukranians
Same old BS! The West talking a good game, but not really willing to do what it takes, and Putin knows that. We should all be ashamed of our Governments. This is not just about Ukraine, but democracy overall.  This KGB dictator must be stopped. Prayers go out to the innocent people of Ukraine.
The Ukrainian government is irresponsible & reckless...ever since I know him he talks & brags of war against Russia trusting in US & NATO...where are your friends now... it's sad civilians have to go through this
https://youtu.be/e3ruxo1qb6o
They need more RPGs.
Wow good to see BBC back in business on war reporting 👍....it was hard to find u guys for the past 10-15 years Iraq,sirya, Serbia, Lebanon, Libya,Afghanistan, Pakistan,  Hati, ....just to name a few
Putin Russia is Weak Putin Russia will Never Have Ukraine The only way Russia can Take Ukraine is if have alliances with other Countries I'm more worried about Korea an China an Japan Joining Russia or Any other countries Joining Russia
Russians are being nice. With that size military and that hardware, they can obliterate half the country. Putin just wants to show the west that no matter how sophisticated the arms given to Kiev are, Russia still has the numbers. Had US/NATO left them alone, this wouldn't have happened.
This is so surreal that civilian cars and military vehicles of the foe are present in the same frame in harmony.
Funny how the west was like hold your ground we coming but they left their keys and wallet at home the betrayal is real lol
What guarantees that Putin will stop at Ukraine? He didn’t stopped at Crimea.
Mother fuck er NATo  help them
I hope the tanks don't just drive over people's cars and crush them like the US did in Baghdad.
#GhostofKhiv 💪🏽🇺🇦
This is the result when you trust USA 🇺🇸 and uk 🇬🇧🤣🤣🤣  both mega countries can’t like USA and uk can’t stop Russian 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Putin, Step down!
To impede young people to leave and possibly force them to take arms will achieve only more deaths and grievances. It is easy to make that decision when they are not your kids. If Ukraine does not surrender unnecessary deaths will continue to pile up.
Omg, cod irl
Not yet
Putin be like: When you do it to Iraq and Afghanistan you are a hero, and when I do it i become villain, that's not fair, hypocrite USA
https://youtu.be/Ydo0rKKjxVg Jesus loves you, 🇷🇺🇺🇦🇺🇸🇪🇺
SO Ukraine wants to slaughter it's young untrained men to keep an ex comedian in power, contrary to popular progressive mythology just giving someone a gun doesn't make them Rambo.
And?
The US Congress is a terrorist organization
Romania supports Ukraine!
Много лжи все перекрутили с ног на голову,фуу пративно слушать ббс
Really sad to see that the US, UK and rest of Europe did nothing to help Ukraine. I support neither of them but I feel bad for Ukraine because the west showed sympathy and promised to help, but now in the peak time they showed their ass.  Sanctions are a bunch of bull shit.  Ukraine under the tyranny of Russia and we all watching it. Hope this doesn't happen to Taiwan.  Now I really believe that no one is holding anyone's back, one needs to learn how to defend itself.
Ukrainian women are said to be some of the most beautiful women on earth. Russian soldiers have been reportedly texting them via tinder, in hopes of some union. If no country on earth is helping Ukraine, perhaps some kind of guerilla warfare could be devised around this theme.
It's time Russia stood up to the New world order led by NATO.
Making sure nato dont try nothing
Hey Putin Vladimir  How would you like if someone or the United States invaded country huh ?
target, onli military techniks
Never TRUST the American and British governments. These governments are known for back stabbings. The Idiot Ukrainian government must learn what happened in Iraq and Syria and Afghanistan. Please people of Ukraine wake up.
Germany and London.
Sad to see so many people suffer because one guy has a stick up his butt. We hope the best for everyone in Ukraine
America sends thoughts and prayers. Also a bag of peanuts and a block of velvets cheese.
Ukraine is literally defeated. Prayers for ukraine.
When Israel attack Palestine civilians the wast never condoms, I supports Russia on Ukraine issue. The Ukrainian must understand that USA and England are not reliable countries they will use you like tissue paper.
Hahaha BBC. Arent they loving this. Not hi. G else in the world happening. How's the truckers getting on in Canada?? How's the Convoy getting on in the US. I trust Mr Putin more that the BBC
Male Privelege at 0:50
Ukraine should stop trying to fight Russia, the civilian army cannot be expected to fight toe to toe against the trained Russian army. By now we all know, no other nations will join in. At this day and age its not that Russia will make the slaves nor would torture them. Its ok to live under Russian rule, and the best thing is you will live.
In the 21st Century NATO does not need to expand miltarily eastwards towards Russia. A group of 30 countries is big enough.
They missed that bus
There's also a possibility where Russia starts using nuclear warheads if any outsiders interfere. Putin did state they'll meet the worst consequence.  Although this could also risk its own country so I hope I'm wrong on this one
Puttin  good job
Katie, you are the best reporter! Most semi-educated and well-educated people in North America cannot even begin to fathom just how corrupt and brutal the neo-Nazi political regime is in Kiev (Ukraine). Funded by Western private and quasi-military sources, (i.e. $45M USD in $100 bills -- hard cash delivered via chartered planes to the Borispol International Airport, which is south of Kiev, on a weekly basis to empower the corrupt Nazi regime in Kiev to continue to escalate the political situation and to destabilize the region for the purpose of political and economic anti-Russia strategy. We have 4k video and clear audio how this is done every week, including the agent provocateurs' names, faces, aliases, passwords for online communication, the online portals used by these agents to communicate with their local contacts, their military ranks, their nationality, their home and service addresses, their social security numbers that we plan to make public for the world to see how all Western wars were fabricated by certain "consultants" in Washington, DC called the "Beltway Bandits" known for their greed and committeemen to sell their souls for money to start any war in any region under any pretext that they literally make up or devise for a $25M consulting fee, including handling the false flag military operation in Vietnam, Korea, Iraq, Libya, Yugoslavia (a/k/a/ Kosovo Dis-Integration) and many other ongoing military operations and smear-campaign activities around the globe with one solitary goal in mind -- to
Американцы!!! Смотрите что творит ваше правительство!!! Это результат американской и натовской политики!!! Вы заставили воевать братьев!!!
Stealing video and not crediting the source.... Shame It's a yt channel suchomimus.
If this succeed say goodbye to taiwan
I pray to Allah to guide all the Jewish Christians. I pray to Allah for the ukrainian Muslims💖💖🤲🤲🤲🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩 nato and america have to take responsibility today Russia is forced to fight because of them innocent people have to take responsibility load Europe and America
Russian vehicles have white z on them?
That one vehicle was carrying a saboteur crew and as funny as it is it was stopped by locals who seized the vehicle, beat up the crew and then just waited on the spot for security service to take them.
Wer is NATO???  I THOUGHT NATO IS SUPPOSED TO STOP THIS BEFORE IT HAPPENS OR AT LEAST GO TO ACTION WEN IT STARTS. INSTEAD ALL I SEE IS A BUNCH OF SUITE AND TIES TALK WHILE PEOPLE ARE DIEING. THE TIME FOR TALK IS OVER. OUR ENEMIES ARE WATCHING AND TAKING NOTES. THEY WILL CALL OUR BLUFF IF WE DONT STAND UP NOW.
With so many prayers and hearts being sent, it does not seem that Ukraine needs any millitary help.
Good luck Russia 🇷🇺
Ukraine is part of Russia, Putin Says, SO WHY IS HE KILLING HIS OWN PEOPLE??
When Russia invade  It’s called an invasion examples Georgia, Ukraine; if it is the USA it is a liberation - examples - Iraq, Syria, Libya, Panama, Cuba, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia. But suddenly we are compassionate, shouldn’t it always be that way, so far we went after weak countries, for god sakes we nuked Japan.!!!!!!
USA & Nato is responsible for this whole Chaos... and they are sitting back in their safe place... never trust Americans... they will use you in their needs and they'll dump when you need them the most!
I m sure if one nato country involved in war and other member just put santion do nothing groups of nato country only in paper not in real world 🌍
Damn man, Ukraine not even letting its own citizens leave its crumbling country.
Yeah ukraine is fucked
So what u thought Putin like west were just messing around?
Let Russia and Ukraina became family again.. salam fr Indonesia.
Dam this is faster than france
Praying for Ukraine 🇺🇦 peoples~!!!
This is modern blitzkrieg
putin is a war criminal. Only one penalty for him - death penalty
Prove this are the Russian military please
This is what you get when the US and NATO have been trying to turn Ukraine into a hostile state and ‘battering ram’ against Russia; a hostile expansion of NATO right up to Russia’s borders; pumping weaponry of all sorts into Ukraine, greatly alarming Russia; flying a US nuclear-capable bomber up to 13 kms from Russia’s borders in November, 2021; ignoring Russia’s security concerns; deliberately excluding Russia from an all inclusive European security architecture; a US instigated coup against the Ukrainian government in 2014, then the unleashing of Ukrainian fascist right wing extremism on the Russian speakers of the Ukraine How would the UK feel if there were Russian military helicopters, tanks etc being sent to the Republic of Ireland? Russia is NOT a bogeyman! The West. i.e. the Washington imperium, has Russia’s back up to the wall!
FCK USA
FACE!!! ITS NOT RUSSIAN
stop terrorussia!
Why are russian tanks there?
Surprised Trumps not over there helping the Russians
I'm with Russia.
What happened to Ukraine soldiers?? Are they dead ?? Desserted?? Planning to counter attack??? Where the reserve/volunteer?? Have the fled the country??? Russian troops met with only minimal resistance and only minimal casualties.. whta happened to defending their country at all cost
The Russian regime is a liar and dangerous entity. It accused The West it was not going to invade Ukraine and proceeds to invade Ukraine. Once discovered, Putin said it was doing a military operation on donbass region. When accused that Russia was bombing Inner Ukraine, Putin denied that Russia had no plans from occupying Ukraine. Today when Russian tanks were confirmed seen on the edges of Kyiv, Kharkiv, and bombs,  Putin's ddog Lavrov now trheatens ukrainians in their own territory? This is not going to end well for  Russia nor Putin
GOD BLESS PUTIN!
Бляди неврите это украинский старый комплекс .солдаты рф на границе киева
END TIMES OF THE WORLD  THIS YEAR 2022
An rpg aimed at the tank's back where the engine is located should do the trick, StandWithUkraine 💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛
This not Russian tank, stupidddd reporters
These are the kind of refugees Europe must accept! Stay strong, Ukrainians!
I love this 😍 power to Russia 🇷🇺✊🏼
We fought Russian troops in Tripoli Libya in 2019, they are the dirtiest fighters ever, they act like savage animals, when they lose a solider they bomb any civilian residency nearby to get revenge, they even put mines in children's teddy bears. They are low live creatures
nicee
Western World must fight against Russia....sad to see that they did nothing...save Ukraine.. love Ukraine.....
PUTHIN ACTIONS ARE VERY CRUEL ON UKRAINE. WHERE IS UNO. & TOP COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD.!!!!!!!!?
Russia seems to be taking out the international bio labs.....why?
Propaganda channel BBC
I give 100% on Russia lets go boy🔥
Why don't these 'Russian' tanks have a big 'Z' on the side like all the others?
Taking Ukraine is a military and political blunder. It will be Putin's undoing, the Russian people in Ukraine and Russia are against this barbarism. His invasion is a war crime. However, none of this would have happened if the West had not exacerbated his paranoia; placed the leader of the Pro-Russian Ukrainian government in jail for 7 years, and threatened to back the anti-Russian leader with western military. We have two, not very intelligent bulls, butting heads with their 'principles'. Cleary Putin is the one most at fault, but we have to take some responsibility for this mess.
Please stop war. Bloody Russian president
Wtf
Your prayers and condolences wont do dogshit to help people getting their head blown off. How the hell is this even happening.
Europe's leaders will go down in HISTORY as INEFFECTIVE, AFRAID and TREACHEROUS. You have meeting after meeting after meeting where you talk and talk and talk. You can NOT EVEN agree on what sanctions to impose. IS THIS HOW LEADERS OF DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES SHOULD BE PERCEIVED IN THE FUTURE. SELFISH, UNWHILLING AND TREACHEROUS!? It seems that you think it is possible to talk the maniac to death!!!! Schultz, why don't you send a little more helmets to a DESPERATE Ukrainian people!!!! BEING A MEMBER OF NATO IS CLEARLY NO SECURITY WITH THESE AFRAID TALKING GASBAGS TO LEADERS!!! I can't feel enough with the UKRAINIAN PEAPLE, how THEY suffer in there loneliness when THE REST OF WESTERN LEADER ARE WATHING HOW THEY STRUGEL FOR SURVIVEL AND SUFFERING WHEN THEY MOST NEED THE SUPPORT FROM THE WEST!!! Who is NEXT in order of the old USSR counties to SUFFER when the rest of NATO members watch an do NOTHING, I wonder???
And Putin and rus military is a devil
Ukraine shouldn't have taken Russia for guaranteed believing that West will betray Ukraine. Russia is fighting for its national security and it's citizen safety. Can't trust the West.
Ukraine became a victim of the war between two egomanias Russia and the west. The west thought that they were the world power and tried to sanction Russia to get Russia down on its knees but Russia has too much ego in him and fought back by starting the war with Ukraine.
Do you know how the people on Afghanistan are suffering? US and NATO left it to be run by a terrorist group that has no mercy to the people? Did you raise your voice for a moment how those people are desperate and suffering  from the claws of Taliban? terrorists?
What can happen when guns are taken from a civilized society.
Fighting continues on the outskirts of Kiev, some groups of russian troops break through but they are quickly neutralized inside the city. Mates -  go to the squares of your cities and appeal to your governments and demand to impose additional sanctions against Russia,  becouse Putin spits not only on Ukraine, but on the whole civilized world
UK is pussy in front of Russia 😂😂
Be sure. Putin will be held responsible!
Raise white Flag is best solution for humanity
So what is next?... Putin isn't going to stop here.  When will Europe and the US stand up?  Which invasion will they draw the line at and will this be before or after China realises that nobody will interfere when they take Taiwan?
bring these damned war criminals to the International War Crimes Tribunal 🙏🏻🙏🏻
I wish oh Allah sef ukrane
The jet wasn’t shot down.” Russia's Defense Ministry said it had destroyed scores of Ukrainian air bases, military facilities and drones. It confirmed the loss of one of its Su-25 attack jets, blaming “pilot error,” and said an An-26 transport plane had crashed because of technical failure, killing the entire crew.”
Gentiles pepare for war and the children of Israel preparing to meet their creator Qudamawi i
Even tho my thoughts are with Ukrainian people here one thing I noticed everybody is concerned about Ukraine but not many was concerned about Iraq, Libya, Palastine and Syria when Americans Nato or Isrealis were killing those civilians? arnt those people too? were they too dark or primitive for the whitewashed western world?
Where are all those NLAWs and Javelin ATGMs ?
Ukraine is not yet lost.
I was in Ukraine in 2015 and they were racists. They denied me and my friends getting in to restaurants. I hope russians destroy them for good this time.
450 ?  coming from Wallace thats just utter bullshit
The falling debris that lit up the night sky is the Ukrainian Su27 plane they themselves accidentally shot down.
This is a horrible sight. Hope everyone is safe and my heart goes out to the civilians. ❤❤❤
Looks like the liberation of Ukraine is almost complete.
A capital can be invaded in 1 day, but that doesn't mean the country falls. This is where the fighting gets real.
Wouldn’t have happened with trump
Ukraine soldiers should be renamed freedom fighters
Go #Russia goooooooo......
How's a english man get to the front line i fancy helping these guys good time of year to scalp some russian soldiers.
Украине было предложено сдаётся без боя это их выбор. А элиткам Украины и России  плевать что люди гибнут с обеих сторон. Им на народ плевать.
Please God please God I beg of you to stop this remove these leaders of power! Bring us a shepherd of peace!
NATO have already done everything other than senting their force directly, which will start WW3 of course, they sent countless equipents and gave them training. So "nobody helps Ukraine" is a common misconception. But Ukraine is just too corrupted and incompetence over these years.
nobody remember how U.S. invaded Iraq and Afghanistan for 10 years, caused million innocent people dead.
SURRENDER UKRAINE
Props to Zelensky For Having Balls to stay in the country even though russian forces are in their doorstep.
Где же вы были когда украинцы издевались насиловали и убивали детей. Своих же детей и женщин на Донбассе. Запад это лицемериные безграмотных уроды
When's the war starting, I'm getting bored of waiting
UE and Nato fully unless. They should send their troops over there and help them. This is just start of 3rd world war. Now ukraine then poland germany one by one. And all will watch how russia takes on.  Send missles to moskwa kill them before they will kill all of us. Have balls its still gona come sooner or later.
Love for Russia from lndia 🇮🇳❤️🇷🇺
Wee all live on the same planet breath the same air Russia need to get a grip and stop wanting war where all in the 21st century everyone should be able to live without fear in there own country's and city's war just brings misery and hate and we should all work together thather than apart where all human no matter what country ur fa where the most intelligent species on this planet we don't need war or guns or bomb we should put all that in the past and move on to enjoying life and living amongst each other as human beings 🤔🤝🌏
Lavrov and Putin should get their own dose of Novichok.
НАЗВАНИЕ УКРАИНА ДОЛЖНА ВОВЕКИ ВЕКОВ ИСЧЕЗНУТЬ С НАЗВАНИЯ ЭТИХ ТЕРРИТОРИЙ, ВСЕ ЭТИ ТЕРРИТОРИИ РУС И ТОЛЬКО РОССИЯ. Чтобы западным русофобам во веки веков не приходилось зариться на эти территории, эти территории Пусть будут вовеки веков русскими и российскими. Чтобы никогда И ничего не хотелось больше русофобам отделить от России !!!!!!!!
Pieprzeni Ukraińcy złamali zawieszenie broni, nie stosują się do porozumieni mińskich, a teraz płaczą. Nie żal mi ich.
Stopping the guys from leaving, because you'll fight if we tell you.
Fake news. It was ukrainian tank.
Praying for the Ukrainian people 🙏🇺🇦💙💛
Before Russia invasion NATO: Come thru the door Bro, join us at the table. We will protect you.  When  Russia invade Ukraine: Hello all bros, please open the door, I need help NATO: May the force be with you bro.
Dond joke with Russians. We wait long, but move fast!!
Poor Ukrain. Left alone. No help from gb usa and europe!!! Gb and usa has murderd just arab children in iraq. Russian is to strong. No children there!
USA ni membawa malang perang
Not our problem ! we are not in europe and should be neutral like the USA was in WW2 ! Trillions wasted in afganistan as a USA puppet , and urgent gross misconduct charges for most of the upper government need addressing ! and dismissals from governmet office are needed !
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
All hail Russia.. Fuck usa
its not Russian stuped women
After Ukraine, Moldova will be the next Illegitimate government which needs to be "reunited" with mother russia right ? They dont respect no one, they throw you a bone when they fight others, so they dont have to fight in many fronts but after that you will become the next target. Btw this is a focus shift from Taiwan, an orchestrated crisis to tie down the west resources so it cannot be focused on one place.
Last year was Afganistan,  this year is Ukraine. So next year will be Taiwan? So now is all depends on their own ppl... God bless them...
Putin has to go
tuta kc ng kano. yan npala nyo sa pag papa uto sa mga kano.
barred from leaving country. held hostage truth be told to keep it going
Don't TRUST the western they will not Help to their ALLIES like Ukraine,they only Promise and Promise but expect with no ACTION they Only use there Allies for their own War......
Imagine being the American President and seeing that
Just to remind all of you saying that NATO left ukraine to fend for themselves. The president of the ukraine quite litterally said that he didn't want other countries to intervene and cause more chaos. After all we as regular people will probably never know what games are being played behind the scenes by the powers that be. Nor will we understand the true purpose of this
My prayers are with all the innocent people who are getting affected because of this war!!   This would have been avoided :(
That was not a Russian tank.
FALSO!!!!  FALSO!!!!!    QUESTO  ESERCITO UCRAINO!!!!!  ❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗  MEZZO CIVILI!!!!!!!!!
Not a Russian tank, it's Ukrainian AAA stolen by Russian saboteurs.
Это не русские пиздаболы
I'am from Nepal🇳🇵.  I think Putin  is the best leader but I hope he will be thinking for Ukrainian peoples as well as Human beings. God bless for Civilians  of Ukraine
Those are ukranian not Russian I believe.
Being arrogant and underestimating the enemy is a big taboo in the military. Just in case, take precautions to protect the family and the country. It is the responsibility of all men, women and children to resist the Communist Party of Russian and China to the last breath.  God bless.Ukraine
Those tracks do damages everywhere
Same to what the Nazis did surpised attack. Only few saw it coming.
One more war caused by USA
I've just watched a tank crush a civilian car which was driving in the opposite direction. Absolutely disgusting. I assume  the occupants of the car were killed.
Other countries doing nothing makes me so angry
Hello Everyone.  I'm from Ukraine.  On February 24 at 4 am I woke up from shots and explosions.  The President of Russia is the second Hitler.  We fight for our country, for the world.  Today Putin wants Ukraine, tomorrow he will want Alaska.  He wants to recreate the Russian Empire.  And he is ready to use nuclear weapons against any country.  He talks about it  in his speech.  Ukrainians are ready to fight.  We are grateful for any support.  Ukraine is certainly a weak country compared to the USA and UK.  But we are a young state that has faced with an aggressor.  Our people are very brave. The 3rd World War has begun. Ukraine became the first victim of Russian aggression.  It is very important to understand that only efforts of all countries that respect the norms of international law are able to stop the war. Do you remember the story of Pearl Harbor? Nowadays, my whole country is Pearl Harbor during World War II.
It isn't even hard to see why things have come to this point. Problems in USA today: 1. US dollars creditability crisis due to over printing money. 40% of all US dollars in existence were printed in the last 12 months. This is set to devalue the foreign reserves of all other countries. In recent years many countries have been trying to find alternative currencies in trades. 2. Inflation soared above 7% due to money printing and supply chain issue. The Fed has planned to raise interest rates to lower the inflation, which risks hitting the economy. 3. Nord Stream II: Last year the USA warned that Nord Stream II must be stopped, but it’s completed nevertheless. The crisis in Ukraine is the reaction by the USA. More reliance on Russian energy supply means Europe gets closer to Russia. It’s the best interests of Russia and Europe to be close instead of being divided. The USA allowed a gas pipeline from Russia to Germany passing through Ukraine, but NOT allowed a gas pipeline directly from Russia to Germany. Why? Because then the USA could control the gas supply to Germany via its proxy Ukraine (Ukraine has a government that the USA installed in the color revolution at Maidan in 2014). One of the most important purpose of NATO is to control Europe, as the first NATO Secretary General, Lionel Ismay put it: “To keep America in, to keep Russia out, to keep Germany (Europe) down”. The very reason for NATO’s expansion since 1991. 4. Russia and China are planning to use Euro as the currency for oil trades, threatening the petrol-dollar. America has just 4% of the world’s population and it’s isolated from the Eurasia-Afro supercontinent where 87% people live. The economy in this supercontinent is rising faster than America at a much bigger size, and Euro is a natural and preferred currency of trades here. The America has a long term strategy against Eurasia, as former Americans NSA chief Zbignew Brzezinski put it: “It is IMPERATIVE that no Eurasian challenger emerges capable of dominating Eurasia and thus of also challenging America.” 5. The Military Industrial Complex projects in the Middle East are closing down. 6. Biden’s low support rate heading to mid-term election. 7. Can’t get Russia into a direct war because it is nuclear armed.  If a war broke out in Europe: 1. Euro drops, strengthening dollars. 2. Capitals from Europe move to the USA. Killing two birds with one stone: reduce inflation, stabilize economy. 3. Russia is divided from Europe. The USA’s grip on Europe is maintained. 4. Petrol-dollar life is prolonged, therefore the life of the American Empire. 5. Continuity for the MIC. 6. Putting America in a commanding position in foreign affairs could boost the support rate. 7. A proxy war would place the battlefield outside of America. One in Ukraine, one in Taiwan (against China).  Seven major problems/concerns of America could be solved/mitigated if the war broke out in Ukraine. Not really that hard to see who’s behind the crisis.  Ukraine is never the root of the crisis but rather the consequence. If the crisis in Ukraine ends today, the USA would probably look for another proxy to play the game, Color Revolution in Kazakhstan in Jan for example. Let’s not forget after Euro was introduced in Europe in 1995, the US supported Kosovo’s independence causing the Kosovo War, as a result the Euro plunged 30%.   In geographical terms: The Chess Players (USA vs Russia), the Chess Pieces (European countries), the Chess Board (Ukraine).  Ukraine is just the chess board. Sorry for the ordinary Ukrainian people who would suffer from it.
the fact that this is 54 minutes ago is...
Only our PM can stop this ongoing war. Modiji please intervene and stop this war. People all over the world are waiting for your response 🙏
People of Europe and the USA, do not pray for Ukraine. Cut off Russia from SWIFT, give Ukraine military support. And pray for Russia.
Imagine the streets you walked the most,  you see tanks, imagine seeing the sky above your home with frightening rockets, and imagine yourself helpless. That's Ukraine's citizens!  The future seems bleak for Ukraine and for the world.
America has very poor leadership. Russia has very poor leadership. The real will suffer from poor leadership. Pray to your God to send a Shepherd of Peace to Earth!
the propaganda of west corporate media is in full scale. the trolls are out of the shadow and working more than ever. we are now asked to care more than ever. White tears are the highest price commodity... Forget about Yemen, Syria, Afghanistan, Soudan, Palestine, Libya, Irak, Myanmar ... they are brown and black so who could give a rat about their tears ... we are talking about something more important here and it is in Europe... life itself is in danger
Us,uk and eu biggest suckers in the world period!!!! U SUK E U
Bludy American is responsible for this war
https://youtu.be/Ydo0rKKjxVg Jesus loves you, 🇷🇺🇺🇦🇺🇸🇪🇺

Bring NATO troops to Help
Россия ❤❤❤❤❤
Only one tank?!! And you guys are so s not to know that Ukraine and Russian use the same weapons that's why the Russians use Z on their tanks and trucks. STOP THE LIES ! ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!
The West has abandoned Ukraine :(
They DID NOT enter the capital. This click-bait title on a video about the Ukrainian war disguises me.
This is absolutely terrible😢 my heart goes out for these people. Stay strong and stay safe everyione.

What you did in Syria,Afghanistan, Iraq killing millions and destroyed Yugoslavia  and did you raised your voice when those crimes were committed? Now you are shouting why you did not stop open door expansion that Russia demanded these exceptionalism has to be terminated.
wow
Humanity is all above stop ✋ war!  Pls Stop war 😔   War is not good for the world!
USA destroyed Iraq and Afghanistan like that. But non of you stood for them.
We will fight this war with sanctions. Hats off to G8 and nato
What is Ukrainian Army doing?!
18 to 60 they about to get drafted.
Once again America do nothing only provoke ukrain .. at the time of help they just blink there eyes ..america need strong leader .. and young
Where is all western nations now?.
Ukraine hv been warned.... No NATO.... Do. Not associated with the US & gangs
I wonder how fast you could train Ukrainian F-22 pilots ? F-22 planes would make sweet gifts for Ukraine !
Lilliput Putin, no one likes you and your dictatorship!
У нас нет стрелы10
Driving over the grass , yeah Russians 100%
This is so disturbing... One day can change our life completely!
My heart goes out to the civilians 🙏, not the country !
Heartbreaking 💔
They attacked iraq and the Arab world on false information that they new where false . America leave that  part of the.world is a tactically move..loads of westen.countries even russia told UK  and america not to go into iraq and Afghanistan.  But America didn't care and they distroyed and killed millions in iraq
Так это украинская оса!
Stop looking when powerful destroy powerless just help in any cost stop discussion only sitting in the chair and looking the event it's not film help the poor we r people defend the thoughtless brainless selfish fellow
Amazing how the UK tricked Ukraine and provoked this war not caring about losing soles. Wherever there is a prob, look for England.
Prime minister is brave man I must say💯👌
Why The United Nations has turned a blind eye to the fact that Saudi Arabia and the UAE are bombing Yemeni hospitals, homes and schools, which have been under siege for eight years, with billions of dollars in weapons purchased from the United States and Europe. But it quickly declares Russia's attack on Ukrainian military bases a genocide !!!
WHO MAKE THE WAR IN IRAK :  RICHARD PEARL  DONALD RUMSFELD  PAUL WOLFOWITZ   3 AMERICANS JEWISH LEADERS   ALWAYS THE SAME
the EU gave ZERO military aid to Ukraine x 7 years since the Crimea invation....no wonder tanks can go anywhere. More then a Putin war this is a EU disgracefull spectacular failure that gave Putin 7 years to prepare this  invasion.Plus the EU has bankrolled the russian military by buying its gas x 7 years.The EU has blood on its hands by its waiting & see policies.

To the Ukrainian people, hit the Russians with sniper fire, use gorilla tactics, hurt their morale, break them down, you'll be amazed at how much damage just 1 good sniper can do, never mind hundreds or even thousands of you, god bless you all, love and respect to you for putting up a fight, hopefully you can take back what these nasty bullies have taken from you. I'll be praying and if you set up a good fund us for arms I'll also be donating. Now go kick their asses 👊
Putin won't be invited on Boris Johnson's birthday party - The best sanction UK can offer.
Nawet na tak ważnych chwilach, jebany YouTube musi dawać reklamy.
Putin 😭😭😭
Putin's aim is to replace Zelensky with someone who will always say yes to him
War is always painful and unwanted no doubt about that but what is very alarming that Russian army entered capital Kiev within less than 2 days !! Though in military power Ukraine is no match to Russia but they have well equipped small army they have US and NATO supplied weapons and training (though not a NATO member), with these helps they failed to defend their capital.
Americans and Europeans should SHUT THE FUCK UP. Israel Bombed the heck out of Gaza and nobody said anything
Sad for such amazing Ukrainian people I never knew before: And so sorry, You were used as slaughter sheep for the "Empire of Lies."
Russians are many peoples, this is a horde
No one wins in war.  Putins not stupid but now one must wondered if he's insane.
NATO take your part in Ukrain before its too late. If Russia comes at the border with Poland you will have never ever  another chance.
Long live Russia
Thank God for Brexit 🙏🇬🇧🇬🇧
Don't they have RPGs to knock down Russian helicopters?
NATO are a bunch of pussies
That was Ukrainian tanks, not Russian near the outskirts of the capital
Thanks NATO, all lives taken is on your hands.. Why are you so addicted to bring NATO in Ukraine?  Maybe you are after its resources. The agreement  was not to give Ukraine membership of NATO many years ago..
Never trust the USA as a "ally".
Massive respect to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for not abandoning his country. Like a Captain going down with his ship.
Joe is the weakest US president ever
C’mon BBC … those are obviously not tanks. Accurate reporting PLEASE!
Its interesting how the great and powerful usa stands on the sidelines and doesn't stand up and defend democracy. What happened? Is it because Russia can actualy defend itself? Lol...
Why didn't anyone help these poor people? What happened to NATO? It will be to our shame that we didn't help them! Do we still feel shame??
Russian tanks rolling Kiev and civilian bus moving like it's nothing? I think Ukrainians wanted this invasion themselves
Not Russian!  Ukraine armour!! The vehicle dont have " Z" symbol
ㅠㅠ
In this modern world...is it right to destroy other country's infrastructure, buildings, home..... can't they find a solution.....its too bad.....i fear soon world war 3 will happen.....
Why dont the world step up and help them 😥
ZELINSKY THE JEW,  PRÉSIDENT OF UKRAINE LOVE TO SEE CHRISTIAN BLOOD IN THE STREET.
NATO's fault. This war is with the blessing of America, the agreement deal was reached 8 months ago.
It was not a Russian tank, but a Ukrainian strela air defense system. What kind of freaks are you after all
I hope Ukraine gets thousands of stinger and javelin missiles to fight with.
Oh no
18-60 male. You are war fodder get ready..
you forgot to mention that allegedly 6 russian jets where shot down by 1 ukrain mig 29
Chase the Nazis out!  There is no place to hide! 😐
Already?!!
I dont understand, what did ukraine do wrong against russia? Did ukraine commit attack? Did ukraine sabotage something? Steal something?
@1:35 imagine you’re on that bus on your way to work!
NATO = No Action,Talk Only.
detRATisation
people of Ukraine I love to fight for u if I get change god bless you all...
One vehicle? Is it what left from Putin's forces?
Too much corruption in Ukraine they have no money to buy weapons and now this is happening 😩
civilians are not fighting back even school buses can be seen in videos everything is operational Ukrainians fine dispite of heavy propaganda westrn media failed to show  Collateral damage russian is expert in liberting countries american and allies needs some lessons  HOW TO libert country without killing civillians 🤣
Hey JOE!!!! Wake up
Go Russia.. NATO fuck you
Fake! It was a ukranian tank
Stop spreading fake news. This video is from this morning, where mtlb was lost and drove into some housing area. There are no tanks in Kyiv. Stop it now!
Free Julian Assange
The difference in tone of the western media when the US invades other dictatorial countries to when Russia invades other dictatorial countries. Its shameful. The only difference being that Ukraine joining NATO and stopping water supply to Crimea has actual implications for Russia.. Which cant be said for any of the countries that the US invaded.
Didn't Putin say he wasn't going to enter Ukrainian territory
we can thank  obama for this crap its 100% the democrats fault.
A chess geopolitical game being played at the expense of innocent people...all superpowers are to be blamed...and DO NOT PRETEND THAT YOU ARE ANGELS. You all had spilled blood everywhere. Time and again...again and again....
international community = the neocolonialists (Britain, USA, and France) = hot air.
He in not able to manage ukrainien  interests , He is destroying the state , He must go back to make comic films that is his job.
What? How?! They already reached the capital? Where's their army? Pretty much similar to taliban takeover of Afghanistan
These are not tanks, they’re motorised infantry whose role is to rush and setup checkpoints or appear to capture objectives.  They had very poor results utilising that tactic in Kharkiv and Sumy where whole columns got destroyed.
Rothschild hate Putin. Rothschild is the enemy of the world
There goes your NATO and USA they leave you alone there cowards.
Putin is straight out criminal!!!!
There is a need for NATO to occupie their part in Ukrain starting from Poland border before Russia knocks their door! Russia wants to occupie Ukrain, why NATO do not want to do the same.
Why can’t they leave the country???why would that be not allowed
Kad ste bombardovali Srbiju BBC je lagao na sve strane!I izmisljao lazi!BBC🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
👁️🌍✍️
where is ukraine army how russia directly coming to ukraine ?
Only if America England and France should go to war all the black military personnel withdraw from it and if they want a war give them a war cuz all European oppressors will fall. America France England Australia Ca and the rest
Zelensky your time its done!!!!! your head will be the currency for Putin
This all is due to usa and its allies
Zelensky sacrifices everything and everyone to keep power. Even future generations of young people. Disgusting.
Fuck Ukraine They Belong to 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺 Hail Russsiaaaaa
Very sad that I cannot trust BBC anymore
Ukraine cannot against Russia without nato's help! If the war continues, occupation of Kiev is only a matter of time......pray for the Ukrainians.
Can you trust Wallace?
All the world country leaders are hopeless. They can't even unite to stop cruelty and Russian aggression . All that they're thinking of is their own bellies and wealth and probably sneaking around with other  women..
🤡
lets gooo 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Lightning warfare 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Job will be done by Sunday
lol wtf how can you let them enter your capital in one day...where the army,police
After watching Russian success on Ukraine, China will definitely attack on Taiwan.  It's a shame that all of major democratic powers have failed to defend a single nation.
Why aren't the population actively fighting them?
Putin and Lavrov's generations will never know peace.
The United Nations is no longer playing a role in maintaining world peace. At least as long as barbaric authoritarian states like Russia and China are on the permanent council, it is meaningless. It needs to be dismantled as soon as possible and a new world order of liberal democracies is needed.
That’s what happens when you listen usa !  Now you are getting crashed !!
The airport was not retaken - that's an obvious lie repeated by the BBC.
Just another morning in Chicago
2:30 fire your interpreter. Can't understand anything because he's fumbling so bad.
Jah jah 🙏🏼please guide them 🙏🏼 1palala 🍀 Rite deh suh 🍀we the American 🍀

USA, Europe are just going to leave Ukraine hanging on its own, They thought that they had the NATO at their back but look what's happening right now, i feel so sorry for Ukraine and its people.
What if it was America attacking... You would have heard how people say mighty mighty. Now it's Russia attacking people are calling them evil 🙄. Russia never interfered in your wars so don't interfere in his period.
Imagine invading a peaceful country because they want to join an organization to protect themselves. No wonder why so many European nations have joined NATO, Russia is not to be trusted.
Fuck Russia and fuck Putin. He claims to be going to Ukraine to denazify it but he is the actual fascist.
There is no Russian army nearly to kiev yet but Ukraine force's taking defense positions in the capital dont belive to fake news
Pray for Ukraine from Tokyo.Stop the war please.
So sad the people are forced to fight against impossible odds. Like the volksturm in the final days of the third reich!
Where are the Ukrainian tanks, helicopters and soldiers?
Won't be surprised if they take Kyiv today
There’s cam Footage of Kieve on 24/7 and as yet the city looks business as usual. People working/ traffic etc. No obvious conflict in the capital yet.
If you voted for Joe Biden, you're DIRECTLY responsible for this.The last time Biden was in the White House, Russia invaded a country. At least you don't have to read mean Tweets anymore.
They are playing battle tank game
this media sites are belong to U.S
EU expressed  a  "deep concern" one more time...
This is not Russian tanks😂
So sad.
Where is your idiot NATO forces?? Where is your British government and Queen???Feared of PUTIN ???😂😂
Now, can someone tell me the gain of being a member of UN?.
Go Russia destroy woke liberal Ukraine
Globalists doing what globalists do.  No countries on earth are mobilizing to save these people, just placing troops at the border to keep them from extending the invasion leaving these people to fend for themselves......NATO and the UN are paper tigers.
This only happens this quickly if the Ukraine Army didn't fight.  At all.
Fake news.The plane shot down in Chuguiv Eastern Ukraine. Tanks are Ukrainian Apartment is also in Chugiuv. A 2014 photo.
strela 10 ukrainian army
Putin is following the step of Hitler. He is destroying Ukraine and his own country. Whole world is facing economic crisis. God will never forgive his sins. He is killing innocent people. This is worst situation for whole world. 😭
If the world war 3 starts the end of the world starts firing nuclear bombs each other caused lots of smoke that can covered the entire world and can decrease the temp and the world starts to suffer.
The west and NATO is world joke
We blame Bojo, Biden and other war mongers for provoking Russia and using Ukraine as a bait against Russia.
Until Russia pushes too far. That's when everyone is in trouble. But the West also has a red line
Pray to get well all who patience and everything is on the way as usual
Putin is megalomaniac!starting war in Europe! and spitting into soul of every dissent human on Earth! god bless Ukraine and Georgia!
Ну и где Американские Джаволины которые так красиво подбивают танки?
Hypocrite USA, UK and EU, Discard NPT, and Expand UNSC permanent member, we can't depend on this handfull of irresponsible countries for world peace
Why are there no checkpoints, no trenches, no sandbags and no Ukrainian soldiers with anti-tank weapons? This is insane, you can't let foreign soldiers into your 'hood.
Only men are forced to stay? What happened to equality now? huh
If he wanted to kill people they’d have let dozens of missiles off and stormed with real bloodshed but they have done it in the nicest way possible
Here we can't even get americans to be patriotic enough to wear a face mask
how hard is it for UN to permanently sign a treaty that bared Nato from going to Ukraine  as grantee for Russia to stop invasion?.
BBC News , talking B.S. with poetry . Not credible.
NATO is kind of a cowerd
See the human race is NOT evolving. We have been killing each other since the dawn of time. How sad. These government leaders are no worse than gang members. Killing innocent people for nothing.
It's a Ukrainian SA13. The Russians no longer use these, they replaced them on frontline duty with the Pantsir M1.  #ScumMedia
Dude wtf isn't nato and it's Allies doing anything to stop this? This kind of behavior should not be tolerated,  if putin ever wanted to be in nato he definitely blew his chances. Russia needs to anex putin form office and be the democratic nation as they claim that they are. To the people who are being invaded my hope is they stay safe and alive
Why "WORLD POLICE" not helping Ukraine?
URAAAA 🥳🥳
😅😄👍🇷🇺😁😁
its sad that the world is like this, why, why is this wanted from Russia.  its really sad... :(
What can  a 60 year old man possibly do? 🥺
any doubts abut russia?
why aren't Ukrainians fighting instead of fleeing away like pussies???
this is the price  you are paying for that silence , which u keep when nato and americans killing millions of muslims in agfanistan iraq libya myanmar kashmir and palestine ,now with ukrain remember those humans also , and speak for those also .
this is stupid you are telling me all these other countries going to sit back.
It was not "full force" relased... It just first, trial wave... "full force" is yet to come... :(
Everybody ready for world war 3
#BanRussiafromSwift #CloseTheSky       #SendNatoToUkraine
An explosion in the sky over Kiev was caused by a mistaken strike by the Ukrainian air defense complex on its own fighter.
💝That" WAS aUCRANIan TANK!
Russia the whole world is with u ! NATO's war against Russia must be stopped ! warmonger western puppet Zelensky deserve this ! Love russian and ukrainian from Nepal ! ❤️❤️❤️
That SOB would go first
Would love to hear more about Russian version of this disagreement.
As a leader i will lead the capital as fast as possible and order the military to burn down anything on their retreat way
Это украинский танк
Russia should become a nature reserve .
BBC always shows picture they want to show. Noone shows casualties of Ukranians unprovoked aggression in eastern Ukraine where they have conducted a real genocide againts their own people. As usual Europeans are shameless - nothing changes. Remember, if you support aggression somewhere in the world, it may return to your home.
exatly what happened to kashmiri hindu's in back in time when jihadi (terrorist)  came from pakistan and raped womens and killed kashmiri hindu's , 500000 hindu had to evacuate their home in kashmir
We need Mr Trump ASAP
Wow binkov was so wrong lol...
I really wanna see a war
Where are those so called 200,000 Ukraine troops?
When you elect comedian to be president, he becomes puppet of USA...
Now they will push this instead of Covid for the NEXT 4 YEARS. Push anti Russian agenda..
Soon the Nazis that were put in the government by the west will be taken down.
lol its funny how the tank is heading the road and the bus doing his job like nothing special.
People should have acted this way when they invaded georgia but no one gave a fuck. Only when it benefits them they do something. This would have not happened if they put him in check during 2008.
I live in Ukraine and we are defending our independence. Many European countries are conferring for a very long time how to help us. History teaches nothing. It is impossible to agree with announcers - they recognize only force.
Here is a video of Ukrainia "Aзов" nazi  paramilitary killing a Russian captured soldier and burning him on a Cross. So think before you stand buy the Ukrainia government  https://youtu.be/6XaxSGth8GI  warning the Video is disturbing
Go Russia
Do literally all men from 18 to 60 do not have permission to leave the country? Is that right?
He’s not after the people he’s getting rid of the government who controls Ukraine and taking control of it. Civilians have nothing to do with this war
russian aircraft are not bombing civilian areas nd buildings wow US should learn from them before liberating any other country in future 😂
Ukrainians didn't show any mercy to the native Russians in Donbass... stop listening to the MSM  . Nato/EU had 7 years to sort this out but did nothing. Putin has been forced into this.
Simple Ukrainian needs to stay out of NATO and just become part of 🇷🇺, in the end they are both one of the same. I’m American and honestly it isn’t us Americans fight we’ve got enough issues here at home that need to be dealt with.
It’s time for war
Its so foolish that Ukraine hasnt surrendered yet.
Waitaminnit, I thought borders were meaningless and bad, and not even to be guarded, and that you're a Not See if you even consider such a thing?
Those who want nato to do something realize this now if they do  putin might get trigger happy with his nukes and that will be the end of everything.
Was not z russian aircraft which shootdown last night, it was Ukrainian aircraft.
It’s crazy how they do not have enough to fight back Russia is overwhelming them with ease
This world is always for those who have power!  Survival of the fittest
Scary times
ukraine president is like a puppet of us and NAto.... president of ukraine must think that us and nato abandon them...
Украина будет повержена и вернет русские земли! Слава армии России!
The military targets are mainly American biolabs, there were 9 of them in Ukraine. Like the wuhan one!
oh western media! 😂😂😂😂
Yet Biden and UK sits on their ass
Wow that was quick. GOD BLESS RUSSIA ❤
Shturm s in thumbnail
Zerlinkski will have to step down, and his corrupt friends around him. But for the Ukrainian people nothing will change. They will not be " occupied".
Men from 18 to 60 barred from leaving the country. Holy shit. These leaders need to fight their own wars.
Stop The War. Loved All The World.
United states is useless
Успокойтесь там все! Не лезьте в наши дела! Наши деды спасали вас в 1941-1945 и не только в эти даты! И вы должны быть благодарны, что и сейчас мы спасаем не только нас а ещё и вас от фашизма!!!
We will fight with Ukraine soon Afghanistan deafeted Russia like little kid before... Russia not strong as people think Ukraine just need some support
Its a Ukrainian tank that drove over a civilian car. One of those that fire at the Russians, hiding in the middle of civilian buildings. It's sad that the BBC won't show you a video shot by Ukrainians themselves.
They wanted decommunization. Now they're getting it alright. Back to Pre-Soviet times when there was no "ukraine'.. be careful what you wish/ask for, you just might get it.
Excellent news go Russia 🇷🇺  go 👏
wonder how the us would react if Cuba became a base for russia... oh wait...
Putin is a hero
"So you have chosen death" - said another senile madman, the Nuclear Joker Bidet!
Не пойду я ни на какую улицу. Вы там офигели что ли?
Glory to Ukraine and may God bless Ukraine! No matter what the cause of this was, the Ukrainian people did not do anything to deserve having their lives uprooted like this.
Its funny and annoying seeing sheep Who says the same everywhere
This Russian invasion of Ukraine reminds me of the US invasion of Iraq back in 2003. Full of non-sense explanations by their barbaric leaders to attempt a justification of the war. This is horrible.
Putin and is chinese friends will know thay can do what they want because the gutless West will do nothing to stop them unless there is something in it for them especially the usa.
USA and EU shame on you. You are useless and culprit.
What's going on in Ukraine is horrible and disgusting. I couldn't image something like that in XXI century. But what I am really ashamed that neither European countries nor the US are not helping Ukrainians to protect their country from Russian aggression. I hope for Ukraine. Slava Ukraine!
Älä huhkaile Venäjää
Sounds like a
Putin should stop invading Country that did nothing to Russia
Syria 😥Iraq😢Afganisthan😥Kasmir

BBC  SHIT
Martial law applies only to men?
Youtube does not tell you BBC is supported by UK government, like it tells for non-western government related media.  This is double standard.
Putin's doctor said he has Autism
I hope they fight like no one is coming to save them. Because no one is coming.
Вам рассказывают то, чего нет на самом деле, мне так вас жаль англо-саксы))
This is the evil regime ‘aggression of the Putin plan.
U.S.  Attacks only small and weak countries.  Like Afghanistan and Kuwait. This is not a super power. U S anable to strike against Russia and China.
now would be a good time to use those 1000s anti tank missiles
OMG. Sorry to say. You are so stupid, Mr. Zelensky.  Your ambitions are too high.  Your ambitions are at odds with the history and geopolitical conditions of your country. You never heard what Russian said. You abandoned for 8 years Minsk Agreement II. US/UK has its own agenda for Russia.  NATO/EU is only a tool and shield from US/UK. If you love your Ukrainian people and your country, you should surrender ASAP. So sad. NATO should be dissolved. NATO became an opium drug that gave the illusion of security in Europe and in the world.  NATO is the ringleader or the culprit of the war in Europe and other parts of the world.  Look what he did in independent sovereign countries like Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yugoslavia (Balkans) and now in Ukraine. Long live Ukrainian and Russian.  👍👍👍

THIS JUST IN  javelins are working
Its war is in African nobody care
The world failed Ukraine!!!
🇷🇺🚀🇷🇺🚀🇷🇺🚀🇷🇺
Ukraine is just getting liberated from western occupation.
That "450 Russian troops killed" BULLSHIT
Какое вранье
How did the person identify that machine as russian. I don't see any insignia or markings, not to mention flag, that can identify the machine as russian.  And another thing. One tank in the city, alone, making noise and some weird maneuvers, that suggests ukrainian crew.
Entering Ukraine  smoothly roads are empty🙄
Why does the Western world get to decide who is evil and who is angel? After desecrating Minsk and other agreements. Trying to encircle Russia. Now trying to lure Ukraine and Russia in a Syria or Lybia like war. Western world and especially US drummed up support for wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria which were completely based on lies. They took out leaders of these nations when they wanted to ditch petro dollar for gold standard. Decades after these leaders gone. Those countries still can't get back to normal.
BBC please check your news before posting no tans enter Kiev yet, fight is very hard and they wore stoped, but more coming we reloading our rocket launchers to fight to death  we have nothing left if we lose Ukraine 🇺🇦 God bless Ukraine and Ukrainians.
Я не доверяю российскому тв , но ВВС - это самое тупое и лживое издание ((((
And where is the cowardly NATO?
I am ashamed to be British, we stand bye and let this happen, this is not who we are as nation, we need strong leaders and let take the fight to Russia. like hitler said, lions lead by donkeys. Thatcher or churchill would have not stood bye.
Glory to Russia! as we talk 48 hours and we in Kiev! Nobody stop as
1 tank? Did it get lost?
In 1939 German tanks attempted to enter Warsaw, but were driven back because an urban environment is not condusive to tank warfare. Hitler respondeg by ordering a ferocious Luftwaffe bombardment of the capital, after which his troops were able to enter. There seems to have been no such fierce resistance in Kiev. Are the Kiev forces infected by woke? That would explain why Polish resistance was much more spirited and ferocious.
Let’s go Russia 🇷🇺
I'll say im so sorry everyday I live if I have to I just dont know what to here i wish I could help I really do this is insane to be witnessing this we shouldn't have to whatever happened to love of humanity our own people we already have to worry of natural disasters killing us why take orders for someone to kill innocent people? Russia y'all clearly misunderstood the assignment!!! You stand up to putin and tell him no we will not kill those people its wrong!! But just know if your ok with this it will come back n bite you hard !!I feel sorry for your judgement day
Whre is US and NATO ( No Action Talk Only) that is NATO means
someone needs to activate their sleeper cells in Moscow and like our late great Ron Popele said......" set it and forget it"
Why do innocent people have to suffer because of ego maniac power hungry men can't handle their shit???? Prayers to innocent Ukrainians 😢
Any Ukrainians out there, could you tell us the situation on the ground in detail. How are you all doing right now?
The west should be helping. Wtf
Russians are advancing to their own Death... they just don't recognize it. ;)
PUTIN IS DOING THE RIGHT THING
Stop this war.
I bet Putin just sees this as practise for taking over other places.  Let's not let them get away with anything. Heavy sanctions are being put against Russia.   If they try and take a mile, I suspect many countries will step in to stop them
USA and NATO also responsible for this damage. They giving hope to Ukrainians but what are they,  USA and NATO,  doing NOW!!
This is so sad
450 russian troops killed?? Did the brit made that up🤣
Just as in Afghanistan,  surrendering the city with little to no resistance.  They do not deserve international help.  You want NATO to fight your battle.
The fall of Kyiv is inevitable 😭😭😭😭
Опять пъяные украинские танкисты катаются
Russia end ukraine the usa end russia this is going to end well for sure
We have to do something now!! Otherwise Russia and China will continue to do whatever they want! We cannot just only stand around and do nothing! And sanctions are not gonna work!
Anschluss 2022.  Did US, EU, NATO and Ukraine think Russia wouldn't respond to their military build up on Russia's border, threats of NATO eastward expansion, and to ignore and dismiss Russia's security concerns?  NATO incited this conflict.
zelenskyy better surrender for his people, rather than calling everyone to join the war. we dont want WW3 ffs. ukraine needs to learn to stay neutral and having peace between west and east. Sorry to say. I hope civilians the best.
talk and talk only those allies
I don’t like what Is Going On .. But people that don’t know more about what’s going on Shouldn’t be quick to judge Russia.. Putin is doing this because of US trying to Use Ukraine as a way to get closer to the door step of Russia.. which president in this world will sit there for his enemy to get closer to him “NO”..  i Blame US for this
If US can invade any country killing and displacing millions in the name of anything then why not Russia or any other country
I wish I were a man!
Russia must fail 🙏🏼
Europe can pack the African "refugees" back to Congo and help their fellow Europeans instead
Needs to be 1000s of Russians
How you know if it’s Russian tank on video? Because you said so?
American an NATO already lost their power to protect their followers.
there is Z's on "russian tanks"?

Foolish of me to think we are past these kinds of wars...
Where are the feminists demanding 50% representation for Marshall law...insisting to stay and fight alongside the men!?????????
Was translation wrong or that Russian foreigner minister a little special?  Made no sense what he said.  He should be executed with putin as well.
Evils being, useless the burden of the world....👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
How lame nato is😥
Well done NATO UN USA other world leaders. Your weakness has been called out by Putin. USA "there will be strong consequences if Russia attacks Ukraine" Yes your anger really helps Biden Johnson  Trudeu UN and NATO leadership putin has looked at these leaderships and laughed called there bluffs their lies. Yes Ukraine you are alone because all the talk by fellow countries was just talk. I hope the death toll is as minimal as can be and for those innocent that fall my your gods guide you to peace
It's a lie! These are the Ukrainian military. Technique is not marked with a Z sign. The Ukranians themselves confirmed this! BBS - fake news!
What nato done???
We are not safe around these superpowers............
Keep fighting my Ukrainian brothers and sisters, never forget that there is no death more glorious then to lay down ones life for their family, friends, and homeland!
I'm excited to be the part of the world war 3 generation 🙈
Russian tanks free to do everything in the street?? And where is Ukrainian army?
While US and Allies killing innocent in Iran, Syria, Iraq and Libya, Russia strengthen muscle power, coward will never defeat the Russia.
This is not based on facts but I reckon Ukraine have a good chance of defending Kiev
Russian army are the most coward people .....#Fuckyouputin
That's exactly the sort of voice I want to hear translating for the mouthpiece of a tyrant
Извините пожалуйста !!!! Вы , либо идиоты , либо лжецы !!!!! Это украинская военная техника !!!
And remember, the BBC would never ever lie to you.
Children as young as 16, an old all the way up to the age of 50 have to risk their lives for their freedom, I feel for the mothers , to have to bury their sons, and won't see them graduate and become the successful men that they can be. I feel for the daughters that have to bury their fathers their Heroes, knowing that his death wasn't in vain, he sacrificed his life, to protect her her future. Here in America we take freedom for granted thinking that it can't happen on American soil. You better f****** think again, Stop this war. This cannot be another WWII where everybody sit back and watch innocent people die. Do something before Hitler Junior kills millions of innocent people
Instead of using Moletov cocktails, why not use drones to deliver 4 ounce jars of nitroglycerine to high value Russian targets? Helicopters and tanks?
Is this some kind of joke? within 24hrs Russian military are driving around the capital unapposed? where's the Ukranian army? Where is the famed Azov batallion? None of the reporting from western media makes any sense.
Just like always, USA and NATO are useless .They are only effective in movies.
This building was hurt by Ukrainian helicopter falling down, shooed by Ukrainians, yes. The Ukrainians showed up this and had given those explications. Time is changing, bbc lying, what a pity
Go gp go putin 🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮
and all these happened at the cold of winter time :(
Not one tank was shown
I urge all fair minded people to see the Nazi in Ukraine.       https://youtu.be/9_orSxqjwnU
Sanctions will not stop the Russians I fear....
If any country ever thought about doing this to the US, every citizen would bear arms and kill the enemy swiftly.
https://youtu.be/JrP63AbapVo Jesus loves you, 🇺🇸🇷🇺🇺🇦
Feeling sorry for them does achieves nothing.
The Russian war criminals ran over some guy in his car with their armored vehicle. Luckily he was okay and local heroes rescued him. But I really hope that evil Russian crew get killed by a British supplied ant-tank weapon.
Where are the z markings
The shot down plane was Ukraine shooting down its' own fighter.
i dont want to live on this planet anymore
This is insane we should not be allowing this to happen military action should be taken if need be
So how did they UK defence sec...take that body count?...that is misleading information..
The US has failed urkaine so as an American I no longer claim the US I am no coward like my own government
I saw 👀 one ☝️😂😂
It would have been nice if the west had a press that wasn't corrupt and incompetent.  Like....oh...the BBC for example.
Oh my Lord. This is INSANE. they are going to kill the president
Ww 3 everyone it is what it is ww 3
How come within only 2 days attack kiev already under Russia.where Ukraine president army and government agency? Even Iraq war ,US take time to reached baghdad. Ukraine more powerful military than Iraq .
BBC reports are as reliable as jimmy savile's word 👍👍
I cannot believe we are just watching….
Putin = poo + tin. He is a tin full of sh*t.
Loser NATO Starts this War Putin is right in his position...
Nato Please help ukraine
🇵🇭🙏🇺🇦🙏☝️
That doesn't look like Russian. I think its Strela-10 air defense system of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
And you europeans and british people- you did let it happen, you did eat it! well here is another threat caving in at your gates.
猎人让猎狗挑衅灰熊，灰熊暴怒要拍死狗，猎人说我用精神支持你
Russia to remove the puppet Ukraine's regime which was installed by NATO some 8 years ago.
This is the perfect time for china to take Taiwan! Lets Goo China!!!!!!!!!
..the Ukrainian president was warned, he was acting tough. Russia and NATO are mortal enemies just as the U.S is with Islamic States. Putin warned him not to bite on the bait as he's been used as an instrument for NATO infiltration into Russia because he's the closest to them  but he never agreed.   The "military sites" being destroyed are also the sites where U.S are developing bio-weapons in Ukraine. Certainly, Ukraine let itself be used by the west and Russia is just protecting itself the same way U.S did in the "Cuba Missile Crisis" of 1962.
Praying for ukrainian lives 🙏🙏
What happen to the US/NATO? Why are they abandoning Ukraine when it need them most now? This is really bad optics...especially for Taiwan.
I have a best friend in Ukraine who has a house here in Greece he said he'll probably be moving here
ਜੇ ਜੰਗ ਖਤਮ ਨਾ ਕਰਵਾਈ ਗਈ ਤਾ ਕੁਦਰਤ ਆਪਣੀ ਭਾਸ਼ਾ ਨਾਲ ਜਵਾਬ ਦੇਵੇਗੀ, ਸਾਰੇ ਦੇਸ਼ਾ ਵਿੱਚ ਵੀ ਐਲਾਨ-ਏ-ਜੰਗ ਦਾ ਐਲਾਨ ਕੁਦਰਤ ਕਰੇਗੀ। ਕਿਸੇ ਤਾਨਾਸ਼ਾਹ ਦੀ ਤਾਨਾਸ਼ਾਹੀ ਲਈ ਧਰਤੀ ਤੇ ਕੋਈ  ਥਾਂ ਨਹੀ। God ਤੋ ਡਰੋ, ਇਨਸਾਨੀਅਤ ਪੈਦਾ ਕਰੋ।😈🌎🌏🌍😈
This is all a smokescreen for the new world order deep state criminal cabal as they see people all over the world rising up against them.
Ukrainians!  Expect nothing from the country whose sport is attacking Harry and Meghan.
They brought this situation to themselves thanks to Cookie monster Victoria Nulan & the EU complicity...
Lets go Russia
So this is why the sudden withdrawal from Afghanistan
Everything changed when the Nato was misled to take on Russia without thinking about their own countries well being. Biggest winner is the US in both economical and political gains.  . Biggest loser is Germany and France. Getting the crumbs left will be UK. Getting bloody would be Ukrainian and the Russian. This is the reality of this conflict.
Very brave of you Lavrov. May God have mercy on your soul
Reznov would be disappointed in Russia
Its Karkiv, not Kyiv. Near border Russia and Luhanks province.
Thanks Russia to attack they always attacks on Muslim countries now they will be feel what we feel from last 20 year 🇷🇺 💪💪
Good, the liberation of ukraine continues! US & GB RIP !!!
Putin is modern Russia czar. We don't need another world War. Shame on us, we haven't learnt anything from world wars. If 3rd world War  will be fought, then fourth world War will fought with sticks, spears, bows, swords and stones.. Stay strong, Ukraine people. I pray for safety of Ukraine citizens and their children
You all have been outplayed, outsmarted, by the person and country you keep disregard, underestimate and belittle, for decades already. Maybe it's time to learn some humility. Or not. Your choice will determine your future.
obviously next 100 years is for Russia , game over for West
Bro Ukraines pls go ahd Russian were not ready to be challenged wirh u guys just go n face to be faced pls their 10th will be equalized to u 1God Promise
Marshall law it's as thay advance thay can replace & expand there army
This is america s fault as they gaslighted this war and now comfortably doing nothing
Slava Ukraini, Heroiam Slava 🇺🇦✋🎱🎱
Russia will take over the country and all the world will watch. Obviously rich countries will stuck sanctioning Russia. War will be over and they will keep watching
It's not russian one. Tf? Stop posting fakes. It's ukrainian
*Russia 🇷🇺 doesn't want war but it already took Crimea from Ukraine. Now Russia 🇷🇺 deploys massive troops and refuse to de-escalate by showing aggression invading Ukraine. Russia 🇷🇺 is absolutely doing the opposite of what it says. Love and support to Ukraine* 🇺🇦
Where is america super power France Germany italy India only talking no support Ukraine
They say NATO felt unloved under Donald Trump when all he wanted was for European countries to stop robbing America and pay their fare share for their own defence! Literally non of this would of happened under Trump or if it did European countries will of been more prepared and this comes from a Brit…  Germany has played right in to Russian hands in their age of military isolationism paying nothing in for their defence and shooting any would be attackers with a stern talk or some do nothing sanctions after feeding the Russian war machine for the better part of 10 years.   The west is such a joke now caring more about net zero and using the right pronouns then defending our and fellow democracy’s land! The funny thing is that apart from the US who’s basically bankrupt them selfs with their virtue signalling covid relief packages, on a virus that’s been proven to be no where near as deadly and had been blown way out of control by the media. There’s absolutely nothing we or any other Northern European country can do ! A shadow of our former selfs and almost laughable when threatening giants like Russia and China!   We and other European countries need to triple our military spending move it up to 5% GDP around $150 billion dollars. This way we can finally fund our cash strapped army with new tanks + equipments, also building more destroyers and naval ships (preferably in the north of the country). The same goes for our pathetic airforce!   We could pay for this by fracking (also in the north) this is what will truly level it up a combination of them both instead of promised that lead no where. It would also help with the cost of living crisis ($100 a barrel atm). An estimated $2 trillion dollars worth and the biggest reserve in Europe… could you imagine what good we could do with that, actually exporting to Europe making them less depending on Russia, loosening Putin’s grip!   Yes they’re an eye sore and may delay net zero for our country, but it doesn’t make a blind bit of difference when we just import it all in anyway! It’s about time we look after our own and finally have some strong decisive leadership.  God help us when China see’s what’s happening under the senile old man called Biden. First Afghanistan and now Ukraine…  If we don’t act now and completely cut off Russia from any trade from our selfs and ally’s starving them out, best wishes for Taiwan when the commy’s come knocking! China will know the west won’t do anything and even if we did potentially starting world war 3.   PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH
America and the west pushed Ukraine into this and now they stand bank providing "moral support" while Ukraine gets destroyed and poor Ukrainians getting killed and millions displaced. All of this is on America and their allies and the idiotic Ukrainian president who is allowing himself to be fooled by the west.
I have grandparents and other family who live in Donetsk. Back in 2012, we went to visit them and at the same time watch the Euro cup, as Donetsk was one of the host cities. Let me tell you that back then, the city was absolutely thriving, clean and just an amazing place to be. I honestly cannot believe what is happening in this beautiful country. I fully condemn what the Russian government is doing, and this is coming from a Russian who lives in Canada. #НЕТВОЙНЕ
Oh dear God. They entered Obolov 2 hours ago. Have friends there.
If any Ukraine male/female seeking a friend or just somebody to talk to when these times are very dim, we’re here 🇺🇸 please keep faith in your hearts and stay strong please. #UkraineStrong🇺🇦
Praying won't do jack, the world defended Kuwait when Iraq invaded yet the world just let's this happen, oh yes I forgot there was oil involved that's the difference
WAR. What a bad thing. Only bad people create it.
#Peace_of_Ukrianians
Ben Wallace in at ground counting how many Russian died lol where does he gets the Figure 😂😂
So much of Russians  soldiers has not been killed is the other way around Ukraine will more likely to lose that much and more.
Good fight as far
Afghanistan case USA says Afghanistan force don't want to fight with Taliban. Ukraine case USA says Ukraine not yet NATO member. Oh pity Ukraine. May God bless you.
Ay yo SHITS POPPING OFF
It's ukrainian anti aircraft vehicle
How come those Russian armour vehicles do not have a clear 'Z' on them?
Its not a tank And its not Russian Gather your sources better
Pick up the guns… they don’t want it any other way!
Keep safe all civilian innocent take care
Before this happened, All i can see was NATO here NATO there, where are they now eh ? No action talk only
BBC is bullshit dont believe a word.
How did the UK defense secretary get those figures. Western media and lies
Free Ukraine from the grip of the Nazis.
WHAT A GREAT VICTORY FOR RUSSIA 🇷🇺 👏
The US removed the nuclear weapons from the Ukraine when the Soviet Union fell, and at the time promise to protect them from Russia in the future. Over 1900 strategic nuclear warheads and between 2,650 and 4,200  tactics war heads....Our words are worthless!!! If Ukraine kept it's nuclear weapons, Russia would not only not be attacking today, they would not be in Crimea either! I am truly embarrassed how our nation has treated Ukraine
What here are needing are enormous  amounts of light of TasarBambas.
Please can someone provide me bomb i will put in the Pocket of PUTIN
Bruh. If this is the last time we're gonna see the Ukrainian president...😵
THANK YOU!!!! MY FELLOW POLES, 4 TAKEING IN THE 💕❤️💕 UKRAINE PEOPLE, AT THIS SAD TIME. WHAT IS THIS 🌍 COMING TO!! GOD IS WITH U ALL🙏 JOSEPH, FROM US

Jesus 💕 ✌️ ✌️ ✌️ Stay believeing ❣️ ❣️ ❣️
We feel
This will happen if the President is not Wise enough when it comes to geopolitical issues. Zelensky took the bait from US, now look what is happening civilians is suffering. 😢😢
Info about 450 russian troops killed is outdated, now it's went over 1k
Belgrade 1999 no body care
See a lot of dead Russians on social media also.....  and the captured soldiers certainly don't look like they wanted to be there.
450 troops dying just like a dog following ridiculous orders from deluded Putin.
R
They haven’t entered Kyiv those were Russian saboteurs.
Ukraine is fucked🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Help to Ucrania NOW Boots on Ground.  Now! Tomorrow is toolate! Save the live of Ucrania President and Family!  Nato do something!!!
Where the hell is Nato or leader's of free world???
Love rusia..  From Indonesia 🇮🇩🇷🇺
Украинцы, вы даже не стоите ногтя чеченских защитников 1994 года. Вам позор!!! Позорище!!! Вы, украинцы, предали Украину!

BBC is responsible for all of this,
Save Ukraine!!!

Remember friends telling me « no way there will be another war in Europe ». Well..

Meanwhile in the US, everyone worries about more government payouts and gender ideology. I weep for humanity and the lovely people of Ukraine.
Europe and NATO are allowing this to happen
This is what happens when a comedian becomes a president.
Nobody can stop Putin in Europe Now..It's over for democracy the door is wide open...Putin is stop until Europe is on their knees begging for gas.
I thought the 5000 helmets germany sent as aid to ukranian military would make ukranian military fierce.
I’m on team Russia 🇷🇺😎
WHERE IS THE UKRAINE MILITARY????
bad for russia
Pray for ukraine
There still bus service running  don't think those were russian tanks
Ukraine 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦 soutien totale au peuple ukrainien
May God punish all those who hurt innocent, stay strong Ukraine 🇺🇦💪
NATO is suck.. group of cowards.. pray for Ukraine
Yea. USSR, now Russia also "saved" my country but in 1945... And we had communism for next 44 years. Russian freedom means secret police killing millions.
We sadly found out the plane shot down was a Ukranian su-27
Im just sad we a a planet are not duing any thing  Its like in school when the big bully picks on the weakest and all the other children look on thinking am glad it isnt me !  Only when bullys are confronted they do eith 2 things run away or fight......We should be an example of russia for China to see
No fly zone for Ukrainian freedom fighters now.   Give them a fighting chance against the oppressor Putin
Putin is reincarnation of Hitler. Every word is based on a lie. World War III broke out. We cannot dream of 100 years peace in Europe anymore. Unfortunately, this villain was not killed by Covid-19. But he is a more deadly pest than Covid!
:))))
are they coming for the president of ukraine?
Wars and rumours of wars , nation rising against nation, famines,  pestilences,natural disasters,inequity,lawlessness,hatred and betrayal,increase in  wickedness , rampant sin and the love of many growing cold  all thats   happening now tell us that we are living  within the bible prophesies of the end times.We are not waiting for the time to come but it is already here. The signs that would happen before the end time tribulation are in place in the world right now. Believe in the Lord and be saved exhorts the bible when the grace of God is still there. Warning signs around us reveal the time to prepare for the coming of Lord Jesus .Today is the day of salvation-2 cor 6:2..for we have no promise of tomorrow..
The international communities should  not stand, look and observe. They have to do something to stop the invassion. Ukraine major city is invaded and eventually  the entire country..
This is Ukraine's fault
Looks like it’s almost already over
I am so proud of Ukrainian troops taking their airport back
That was lightning quick. I was expecting more resistance and not a repeat of what happened in Afghanistan. Let's hope the casualty rates remain as minimal as possible and a speedy end to this conflict.
Why is not every building occupied with a Ukrainian soldier armed with anti-tank rocket?
God bless Ukrainian
Your time Will come soon Russia sooner or later. Just wait and see
Sedih juga liat ukrania. Cuma mau gimana lagi, siapa juga yang mau melawan russia demi bela ukrania. Hanya bisa menonton dari sini
It is ukranian tank
This looks like magic. I expected Russia to be around Kiev in a week's time, not within a day.
Shoebilled Stork is also A Duck
U - useless N - nations
Unless Russian citizens get control of their country, they are going to have a very bleak future for decades to come.
Let's be clear. Putin said what he wanted. No NATO and NO Offensive Weapons. NATO called his bluff and said, "we won't be dictated to". Putin is now showing he wasn't bluffing, but the woke NATO / EU powers were bluffing and don't have the balls to do proper sanctions, let alone actually commit military. Von der Leyen has probably ordered some more broom sticks for European soldiers to practice with. This is thoroughly NATOs doing, and the lack of experience on the Zelensky's part. a) he should have seen the writing on the wall, how impotent the Europeans are and not relied upon them b) he should have played the geographical position of Ukraine much smarter and looked at how Singapore handled their situation in the 60s/70s Sadly, now there is only two possibilities 1) he declares neutrality and not to host offensive weapons 2) Don Putin will install a Russian friendly dictator like Lukashenko. The problem for us now is, Taiwan is gone, and they will be just as impotent with that as they are with Ukraine. Well, the woke globalists wanted a NWO. Now they are going to get it, but it won't be the Americans in charge.
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
guys those tanks could be ukranian they use the same tanks as the russian u know.
I have been thinking but it is almost time for China to claim Taiwan back
I wish someone would explode these invading tanks, they're very expensive, great for blowing up
man hunt for pres.of ukraine
My sympathy for the civilians. But honestly it's nothing compared to what US and NATO did to Iraq in 2003. Now imagine their sufferings.
That putin has turned into a madman wheres the nearest asylum?
How we know that those tanks are russian
No more brother wars! Us Europeans should rather unite and fight our common enemies.
Where is nato😂🤣
Time to wake up, sleepy Joe.
West bought by Putin's Hitler
GREAT RUSSIA 🇷🇺 👏 👍 👌 🙌 😀
Chechen fighters and the Mujahideen Brigades are being assembled and going to Ukraine to help the Ukrainians. Viva la Resistance 🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
Is this Russia or Russian backed rebel groups?
No more wait.  Should restrict Russian to use SWIFT immediately to let them feel pain!! Besides, pls send a fast air force to bomb blast Russia local land and their key facilities to make them got real pain too.   If so  Russian will know what is real war that hurting them directly and crying to stop themselves!!  Only self-defence will always loss at the end.  Have to be proactive fight back into Russian local lands to make turn around.
🧐
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
We have watched that maniac build up to this for years and no one did a damn thing to stop it.
FINALLY UKRAINE IS GETTING FREEDOM FROM NAZI GENOCIDE 🙌 👏
there more than 100 tanks surrounded Kiev and where is the help of Europe and USA with weapons and sanctions????
Pls why can't some Ukraine force go down to Russia to create some damages on them as well
All caused by NATO expansionism. They pushed the Russians into a corner. Russia pleaded with NATO for a year not to admit Ukraine, and NATO, led by the USA, told them to piss of and mind their own business. Well the Russians are minding their own own business now, and making sure that NATO missles won't be installed along the Russian border. That's what this is about. The West (THAT'S OUR GOVERNMENTS) are the instigators of all this 🤷‍♂️
Bruh. This is fucked up. These civilians dont even want to be a part of Russia anymore. They are being taken by FORCE.
Picture Russia and China Combined. East vs West. Not an All Stars game.
Putin! Get your filthy hands from Ukraine! dont bring your values to this free country! dont throw them back to the Middle Ages as you did it to Russia.
This is so exciting. Zelensky is now alone, after being propped up by decietful West and America.
Is NATO becoming weak and no longer powerful enough to face Russian army and China.. So we leve a country to fight for a war they didn't want.. I know Russia will use nukes to fight the world but they forget that God will destroy them..
Flashing lights
Only vietnamesse,, iraqi, libyan, yugosolovakian, afgani people can feel Ukrainian people pain
Нападает на Украину как на Польшу Гитлер.
wait why just men? what happen to gender equality?
Where are the paper tigers America, Britain and NATO. I think they only roar against weak countries like Afghanistan and  Iraq
I'm sorry but this is some mess you supposed to see in movies not in real life I thought we was past this foolishness😒 its sad and embarrassing for the human race no wonder we dont know if others are out there they probably are terrified to introduce themselves to us I would be
Thisbis Ukrainian nor Russian its A coup
My thoughts are with The Ukrainian ppl  Biden needs to grow a spine & stand up to Putin
Nazi MI6
The people should have fought for there country instead of running away the French did it in WW2 why can't you
Hong Kong and Taiwan might give invade by China just like this. People don’t want the war after all.
whos that dumbass the other day who said that to reach kiev need a long time
Here's an idea: Millions of Ukrainians flee Ukraine, and take refuge in the EU, the UK and the US, and then they'll have the protection of NATO.
And then  Russia must drop TasarBambas
Men ages 18-60 can't leave the country. To the sons, brothers, fathers and grandfathers stuck in a war they didn't want and couldn't leave...fight with honor and give them hell! To the women leaving the country, take good care of the children and honor your boyfriends, husbands and fathers. These men are fighting for you and look forward to getting back to you, so be there when they come back...it's all they ask.
Never forget that the Ukrainian government instructed its civilians to throw molotov cocktails on Russian tanks. This government is NOT on the side of the people. This government is there planted by the west to pit Ukrainians against Russians, to hurt the enemy of America. Civilians throwing Molotovs on tanks will only result in dead civilians.
BBC heheheh
Zelensky copying Hitler forcing Ukrainian citizens to continue risking their lives just to save himself instead of capitulation
Russia vs Ukraine - easiest explanation.   I'm sure everyone is confused.  If the news version of Russia vs Ukraine is too complicated, it is recommended to read the commentary of the novel version.  See translation   More than 20 years ago, Ukraine divorced her ex-husband (Russia), and several children belonged to her.    The ex-husband was also very accommodating to her and left her a lot of family property. After that, the ex-husband also paid off more than 200 billion debts for her.    After getting rid of her ex-husband, Ukraine started flirting and flirting with the village bully (USA) and a group of prostitutes (Western states) until she was completely in their arms.  That's still okay, (but) she completely listened to the village tyrant, and hooked up to attack her ex-husband.    The ex-husband was very angry and insisted on returning a child: Crimea.    Ukraine began to hold grudges and dreams. She wanted to marry into the NATO family and squeeze her ex-husband.   The village bully didn't want to marry her. He just wanted to use her to bully her ex-husband.  With every effort, the two children were forced to cry and look for their father.   The village bully was always on the sidelines, just sending some expired items (ammunition) from time to time.    Ukraine thought she had someone to support her, and was even more presumptuous towards her ex-husband.    The ex-husband couldn't bear it anymore, and looked at the poor children, and rushed over with the guy to ask the two children to go back, so they started fighting.  Weibo netizens posted this explanation of the relationship between Russia, Ukraine, the United States, etc. with a family ethics drama.   I understand immediately 😀
very strange invasion, with buses operating in the city. People seems to accept the situation or decided not to fight. Poor Ukraine.
Eh didnt it state that russian vehicles were all painted with a big Z? are these def russians
Watching former Vice President Joe Biden getting pegged by Vladmir Putin on the World Stage😲......Priceless🤣
In the next 24hours Kiev will on russian control
Mr Putin is ridding ukrain of US / NATO's military infrastructure designed to destroy Russia .I pray protection of psalm 91 from the Holy Bible over Mr Putin and Russia ...the warmongering US caused this .Putin is not their subordinate
Prayers dont do shit when they need guns, men, material, and vehicles
Vladimir Putin it's second Hitler off the World.  World have to wakes up.
God bless Russia..crush the west
Fuck I just want european and US forces to go in and batter the shit out of the russian conscripts, but that would mean ww3 and the destruction of the world as we know it.
NATO must challenge Putin in Ukrainian airspace with planes and missiles. If not there will be the need to do so in the future anyway. Better to do it now while Ukraine still fights on the ground
I wish the world would not give a platform for Lavrov - he's a sociopath and terrrorist
Let's just nuke Russia, China and North Korea and eliminate them from the political map once and for good.
F8ck Russia, F8ck Putin! Biden, Obama you're coward jerks, and f8ck you Trump. Our thoughts with you, Ukraine <3
While the world stands by , this is Putin giving a one finger towards the west , I can do whatever I want what are you going do about it
ББС НАТО НАЦИСТИ. СЛАВА РУСИ.!! ПОЗДРАВ ИЗ СРБИЈЕ.!
Zelensky had so many opportunities to prevent all this. And he only wants to talk now, when quite a bit of his country is under russian forces.
Sad man. Any military aged Ukrainian male is basically condemned to die at this point .
this is a nightmare, they never asked for war😭😭
UKRAINE     ✌✌✌✌  !!
A mostly peaceful invasion
All of this could have been prevented. Ukraine should have said "we will never join NATO, we will not develop nuclear weapon, we will respect Minsk agreement".
Who are responsible for this situation.. Why NATO wants Ukraine to be part of it?
USA's goal - to cause a long term internal battle using the word peace talks Russia's goal - imma end this bs now
It's sad to see Zelensky fall into USA traps and now he's involved in a war without the helped they promised
Everyone in Europe who have military experience and willing to help come to Ukraine and help us fight back Russian empire. Together we can bring Putin rule down. Every Russian that value human life - don't go to Ukraine don't comply to orders from this monster. GO OUT AND RALLY FOR PEACE.  If a million come out you no police could stop you. Share this message in social media.
Now I will continue to see where all national leaders across the world really stand on human rights. Biden started this by selling his son into the Russian underworld. The truth is slow, and the war is to dominate with China and the belt and road initiatives!!!!! This is a wake up call,  the ugly kind.
ukraine should have just said it wont join nato. unfortunately, it didnt. a comedian president made serious mistake in diplomacy. that's why.
Where's the nato game play...
Weak western countries
That’s smooth how they do it. Not like American soldiers and nato shooting soldiers with civilians drone booming streets with innocent children in the Middle East.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is all worried about the carbon footprint of the Ukraine invasion. . . I think little Greta Thunberg needs to throw a tantrum about that.
When you have for  president a comedian, the end of mandate will be tragedy!
The international community left Ukraine alone :(
Since the introduction of social networks, modern man's balls have shrunk. In the old days, peasants, horsemen, knights would stand up and fight side by side..
Salute to Zalensky. 1000 spits to Nato.
Poland we ask you for support please send in your troops let's stop Russia together before they get to your borders🙏. Ukraine Is Europe. Ukraine is Democracy.
Total blackout should be maintained.
Left unchecked, it seems DERANGED Putin will be bringing  war to more countries in Europe, especially the West. Which means destruction and death on catastrophic proportions.  Hopefully all the Strong and Independent women in the West who need no man, are ready to fight in the front lines without the men, to defend and protect the Western society. We are waiting. The time for action is now, not delusional social constructs. Reality will soon collide with deluded feminism.
Is this Ukraine or American and Mexico
Had Allah wished to take to Himself a son, He could have chosen whom He pleased out of those whom He doth create: but Glory be to Him! (He is above such things.) He is Allah, the One, the Irresistible.
Why are men only asked to fight, the EU should reject this sexist regime
Why is it that they have a bunch of videos of Russian troops moving through the cities and streets but they don't have a single video of Ukrainian military at all
War maschine propaganda
No war plz let become humman fist
Ukraine will be overwhelmed and the west are afraid of Putin. Russia is about to get alot bigger .Putin is a murdering prick.
Where is the US? NATO? Don't show your power to lessen military power like Iraq or Afghanistan. Why only talk no action? Show US/Nato afraid of Russia military might.
The West has abandoned Ukraine
Hope russia fails
According to CNN and other outlets it was a Ukrainian SU-27 fighter jet that was shot down over Kiev last night in that video.
Only in battlefield
Poland , Romania 🇷🇴  , Taiwan  Etc USA is Fast Fading Power . " ONLY MONEY " 💰  Is what USA 🇺🇸  Care About Nomore Democracy,  Liberty  .God Save Us
It reminds me about 1971 when western alliance I mean USA and Britain send warships towards Indian Ocean to counter India for helping their friend Pakistan it was only Soviet was stood between them and India with a Submarine. The aggressive approach from Soviet pushed them back. We were lucky to have that kind of friend but Ukraine were not so lucky all they got hastage we stand with Ukraine.
Where is the resistance ? This ain't no war ... Russia is just bullying Ukraine
🙏🙏 stop war 🙏🙏  War only create problems
Hypocrite west provoked putin. Now they oppose to ban Russia from SWIFT. if I don't mind to take arms to fight against putin then why European and US are afraid of.?
Freedom comes to Ukraine people from Nazi World Order.
The saddest of Ukrainian citizens. Stay strong Ukraine !! No body help you better than you help yourself in this time .
That is the true president zelenskie had never abondon Ukraine while Russia invade his own homeland where he leaves... prayers to Ukrainian peoples..we pray for stop the war..
One really does have to feel for those poor 16-18 year old boys they still in school and now they have to go risk their lives. So sad :(
They are not tanks and they are alredy destroyed
Where is US and it's allies. Where is NTO force. They talk big fat word before.
Go Forward RuSSiaN Army 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺 Take control this country. I sorry  🙏🥺 but this reality  when your country became black sheep 🐑🐑🐑 by US and nato
Why all those supporters did not blame Ukrainian army? Ukrainian army was bombing Donetsk and Lugansk for last 8 years, killed many thousands of civilians.  Why no one says anything about it?
Ukraine is done for, they dont even have the amass number of russian soldiers.. topping 190,000+
God help them
Its not russian, where is the Z marking?
SOVIET ANTHEM RANDOMLY PLAYS 🎤💂💂‍♀️🇨🇳💂‍♂️💂‍♀️🥁🕌💪🏽🎶🎵🎼
Is European Union not enough that a NATO is required ? DROP NATO ... and there will be world PEACE.  Any military emergence is a coercive power. NATO is a monster planted by western superpower that has grown enough now to incite the eastern superpower.  Thus, NATO is the pathway towards 3rd and final world war. Any country joining the ideology of NATO is a contribution to the destruction of mankind. 'NATO for peace' is a misnomer, because its a military alliance. No military alliance will ever work against modern nuclear warfare. Until a full blown 3rd world war explodes, NATO is an undercover alliance by US to unleash cummulative economic sanctions over eastern superpowers as well as gain access to setting up military bases close to its targets. NATO also silences its members to give a freehand to US to invade its targets (ex.Iraq) on false pretext of say 'weapons of mass destruction' although US itself is a nuclear power !
That are ukrainian tanks, russian have white “Z” painted on them…
i love bbc news so big
Russian generals should take Putin down. He's a crazy bully and is harming Russia.
Wonder why it didn't show the tank running over the car??? If anyones seen the whole of that civilians vid, they will know what I'm on about.
Putin has blood on his hands
It just proves to that the USA and nato can not be trusted.poor those ukrainian leaders whom trusted the USA and nato and look what's happening now,they left Ukraine behind on their own...
These idiots in suits always causing and bringing bad news to people
Taiwan is so up on the pinball machine next.  There's blood in the water, and the air is ripe with the stench of Team Joe's poopie pants weakness.  It's going to be a feeding frenzy now that's it's clear that the world's police force has been defunded and cancelled.
8 years Kiev was bombing Donbas almost every week , 8 years and nobody cared .
Where is Un/Nato,let me guess hiding  in a hole,they all a bunch  of rabbits
1 Million innocent lives lost in Iraq and no one bats an eyelid.
What about Yemen and US-Saudi coalitions kiling yemenies people over 300.000, is that ok?
Where is NATO  i dont see them
Erwin paulo de Jesus loves russia
If Trump had won in 2020, this is what the US could look like.
NATO is willingly allowing Putin to take Ukraine #whatgoodisNATO
Set up ieds for the tanks
Each time there is war the population is alot less
Korea loves russia
This is ukrainian tank is not Russian!
Russia is the most powerful country in the world , uk afraid to declared war against russia 🤣
It would be better for Ukraine if the Western leaders had not given false hope to Ukraine

So many people fleeing away , - tells you:   how Good opinion they have of present government.   🤔
They need to put the fire in Russia only way to stop this evil
God bless Russland!
If Biden didnt lift sanctions put on Russia by Trump then none of this happens.
if recent history taught us one lesson, it is that when shit hit the fans, the western powers will leave you all alone to deal with it.
The elite have prob already move on to there next crisis.
Its a ukranian tanks idiots
CYKA BLYAT
Poor handling of the whole thing by NATO n US. Ukraine left alone to fight ☹️
What is NATO going to do, they are all corrupted.
Then ukraine should not fight back, or anyoutside forces. Less casualty. But its not gonna happen since all elephants wants to show who pees higher. Hahaha
Lavrov telling everyone the Ukrainian people should have had an escape plan from the very start, even though he repeatedly lied through his teeth saying there is no plans for an invasion. This invasion has been planned for years. Absolutely disgusting. Stay strong Ukraine keep fighting 💪🏻
I bet the bus driver was like - bloody hell - tickets please.
KIEV MODERN WARFARE 2          “NO RUSSIAN” ELEVATOR AIRPORT MASSACRE MISSION
Good decision from Mr. Putin
Around four month before Israel ware strike occupied Palestine 🇵🇸   un armed civilian and BBC Western media ware not reporting how is painful 😢 at that time
good
Russian soldiers: fuck it lets drive downtown and see what's up
Thanks to people like Truss, (a pound shop version of Margaret Thatcher).  Britain has become a sorry joke on the world stage.  UK is pursuing a foreign policy which shows a lack of realism regarding its actual circumstances,  We are now seeing a British foreign policy that is high on rhetoric, low on substance, big on threats and small on solutions,    US/UK are country's with weak leadership, a weakening military and economically bankrupt.
OMG OMG  Gosh,I feel so damn helpless right now....
Take up arms and fight for what is yours!!! Better to die on your feet then live on  your knees!!!
This is Ukraine strela 10 you Muppets
Say what you want about Trump but he would have never allowed Putin to do this !
To be an enemy of America is dangerous , to be a friend of America is fatal. Think twice.
in short, America's unbridled greed and bigotry is being punished. Russia's move to break the siege has taught the West a great lesson. The world is on the verge of a return to the Cold War. The time has come for us to see a balanced system, as the United States and its allies are on the verge of another rift. War is bad, but it sometimes it will bring good results. The only thing that American democracy has for poor countries is poverty. Russia's latest move is expected to address widespread US-led injustices. but for the people of Ukraine who are now caught in the middle of this superpower's war, What can be done but pray for them.
Why were NATO peacekeepers brought into Yugoslavia, and now, when there is a genocide in Ukraine, NATO is silent? You are all cowards. Your sanctions will not stop Putin!!!!!
🇺🇦🙏
The Criminal arrogant west has thrown yet another country into the inferno and stood there watching and biting their lips
Where are the us troops that left for ukraine
Ukrainian shot there own su27 not russian
please, God send peace!!! 🙏🙏🙏
Europe and other civilized countries betrayed us by not imposing more sanctions against Russia and not adhering to Budapest Memorandum
WHY DID NOT THE UKRAINE SEE THE WAR UNTIL IT HAPPEN ,THAT'S SO SAD FOR THE CIVILIANS FOLLOW THE WRONG LEADER
Red dawn part 2
Putin is a war criminal, and one day should be tried as such
Well good news finally!!! According to the brits looks like Russia is losing the war
THE UKRAINE PRESIDENT IS A BONIFIED LIAR!!!
United states won't take any refugees. Because they are white.
This is FAKENEWS. Its a 9K35 Strela-10 short-range surface-to-air missile system. The lack of markings V Z O indicate that this is not a russian army vehicle. Also the lack of any infantry support suggest that it is indeed ukrainian, hiding in the suburb in order to attack helicopters. The sad story is that this vehicle ran over a moving car on a nearby road and apperently killed the people inside. It can be seen on another video circulation the net.
Oh my God! They are already inside the City.😳😳😳
now  NATO MUST HELP UKRAINE🌧
“To be an enemy of America can be dangerous, but to be a friend is fatal.” — Henry Kissinger
Well.....putin just made himself un unending war. Dumb ass.
Putin cannot catch terrorists... so he is killing own christians in neighbour.country. If he tries to catch terrorists.. he may not get oil and gas....
in 1991, the USA, Great Britain and Russia guaranteed Ukraine, if it got rid of its nuclear weapons, the defense of its territorial integrity and inviolability of borders. Ukraine did so and now we see help from the West. It was better not to listen to anyone and keep the nuclear missiles, then no one would ever attack her. Such are the alliances with the West and communists
Must be madness to not be able to leave the country. It’s sad for the people in Ukraine
Russian will be in France in May
Why I don’t see any Ukrainian troops or soldiers from mainstream media or social media??
America never trust,,
Reminds us on the  numerous operations which the USA have conducted in the recent history.
"Bloody Vlad"! Everyone who shakes hands with him, stands near him, will have blood on them from his killing.
when comedian turned politician
Stupid Zelenski... Gambling with Ukrainian citizen safety... MINSK 2 ACCORD should be implemented by now...
Yes baby. Let's russianise the world
Sad 🥺 day truly
Well done Russia and ukraine,climax has happened so fast.where is Ukrainian resistance.the joker president also talked a lot.there are not much damages in Ukraine as well.😁. Communists are slapping their own faces.very smart.
Ukraine should secede from NATO alliance and Russia should move towards peace talks. US has always been disturbing world peace which should be stopped now
Ukrain president is the idiot one. He could not realise that USA used Ukraine to create a reason to put sanction over Russia. USA/NATO ignite this war. By joining NATO Ukraine was bringing Russia's biggest enemy at their doorstep. Russia didit in self-defense from NATO countries. Russia was continuously appealing to give return assurance and we will not go for war. USA ensure not to give written assurance to made this war happen & solve their moto.  In 1971 Indo-Pak war USA send its warship to attack India, but it was Russia who send its warship to counter USA Navy. In current time USA provoked Ukraine & now enjoying sitting at safe side. USA is non reliable country.
The rest of the world needs to fight too
You supported Nato dumping uranium on Serbia. You betrayed your Orthodox kin for their money and power. There is your friend nato and the west lmao F***ing idiots
The West has been provoking Russia with their NATO expansion agenda. Now Russia is giving them more than they bargained for. I feel sorry for Ukraine for being used by the west. Taiwan watch out when China invades no Western country will defend you.
Karma is a b####
Everybody, say thanks to #joebiden for this!
PEOPLE OF UKRAINE FOR UNITY GO OUT TO CONVINCE SOLDIER OF RUSSIA TO STOP WAR FOR THE LOVE OF YOUR COUNTRY UKRAINE, DON'T AFRAID TO DIE FOR UKRAINE BCOZ SOLDIER OF RUSSIA WILL NOT DO KILLING CIVILIANS OF UKRAINE AND IF THEY DO MEDIA OUT LOOK FOR YOU AND ALL OVER THE WORLD WILL SEE WHAT HAPPEN, BCOZ IF YOU STAY AT HOME STILL RUSSIA FIRING MISSILES AND NO ONE EXCEPTION TO BE KILLED, IF YOU DO MARCHES TO SHOUT OUT TO STOP WAR FOR YOUR LOVE OF YOUR COUNTRY UKRAINE, TO STOP MADNESS OF PUTIN. THIS IS THE WAY TO DEFEND YOUR COUNTRY UKRAINE
I was in Ukraine back in 2012. I met some really lovely people there. I hope they're doing ok and keeping safe.
Shame on russians shame on you peoples
I'm very saddened about this.  Sanctions won't work.  China and Russia are allied.  They have their own economy together in place.  And ready to go.  We needed boots on the ground. And we needed to help Ukraine.  We suck as a planet. NATO is weak and so is my country
It's not good situation but you peoples also need to think that what your forces did in Syria, lybiea and Iraq...... That Muslims have not their families children's
Putin the terrorist.....
That’s good the war should be over in the next couple days then
Holding out with no one coming to help them... Heartbreaking.
This is old footage. You keep updating but with old news
No one want thier enermy allies next to them  pray to Ukraine it unfortunate event
At this point i think this will be a war in days or weeks, if it is longer i hope its because there is resistance and not because putin is taking europe
The next target if Russia achieve victory in Ukraine will be the Baltic States.
Shame to the Russian government, under false announces entering the border to Donbas to be the so called peacekeepers and heading up to Kiev, Shame on them, I looked up to Putin, but im mistakingly wrong,  his true face appeared, Shame shame shame!
This is what Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans have gone through and now Ukrainians are going through. Nato and Russia are disaster to the world 😭😭😭
Biden got all the kickbacks he could out of Ukraine and he had no more use of it.
Zelensky is a responsible personfor this brotherly war!
Biden king of the sanktion
I hope this will be a liason to everybody who has atomic bombs, don't give up on them nobody will protect you they just want to destroy you.
Imagine being a civilian and seeing that…
Real support is needed, not orally: 'I've asked 27 European leaders.' 'No Answers.' Zelensky insists 'Ukraine is not afraid of Russia' - YouTube
Ukraine trust on Europe and America. And see the results, Russian troops are in Ukrainian capital just within two days....
2:09 that accent though. 🤣
These nazi Ukrainian nationalists are scattering like rats from a sinking ship as the Russians de-nazify the country. NATO are on wrong side of history again. Long live the DPR and Luhansk Republic.
https://youtube.com/shorts/RjzoFBXKbEI?feature=share 🇺🇦😢
Funny news claims ukraine wining 450 kills yet begging russia to retreat  and russian tank inside capital
What about civilians in iraq, syria, palestine,yemen libya and Afghanistan
Most of our finnish newspapers keep making it seem like russians are having troubles invading...But something doesnt make sense now russians are in kiev
Just another normal day in Palestine
These look like Ukrainian armor
West failed Ukraine after encouraging it to fight Russia.  Poor Ukrainian.  Cowered west .
The tanks are roming around in capital city whereas there is a claim the Russian troops are getting resistance & around 400 being killed....hard to believe.
This is horrible,My heart goes out to the civilians!😭💔🙏
Notice how silent the Putin apologists and bots are right now. They must feel real good about themselves now, the pathetic bootlickers
Russia 🇷🇺 in exile suffers loss of life and property in war with Ukraine 🇺🇦  Nato must take action to stop Moscow aggression.
Ukraine needs to put up more fight do not give up
The Z on the Russian millitary vehicles is clearly Zelensky
stvarno ukraina nije država jer je niko ni ne brani,žalosno
The west needs to step up and help its allies, the one they disarmed in the 90's, Man Democrats are dumb...
One man's invasion is the others liberation. UK and USA pushed Germany and EU to a deadly ploy. This is a similar situation just before the war broke out in 1939.  I hope Covid did not take away all the good people in the world. How on earth did EU let 14k people to be killed in Donbas region since 2014. How on earth can NATO keep expanding without someone standing up for the bullying??? One soul dead is too many. Let love rule the world. Let others live as we wish.
Nato we will  remember your  anxiety and  betrayal  forever!!!
US Bio labs must be destroyed to prevent virus like Corona 19.
Aren’t Ukraine fighting ?? Why I can’t see any Ukraine army’s??
Shame for nato and America
So sad….our political leaders they don’t learn nothing from previous world war…
Take the fight to the argreesor.
无险可守
I am from Kyiv region. This is real life horror. I didn't believe that Russia and Belarus made full scale invasion to the last point. Because it is illogical. So as you is not believe that Russian is able to invade and bomb you're country and houses. Please make all that you can to stop Putin now. Till he is not start new world war.
God Bless 🇷🇺 Russia
You do know without putin russia could join nato right? Putin has little man syndrome and wont forget the embarrassment of the failure of communist ussr
That is so cruel and bad , Putin will be solely responsible for any deaths a warmonger
USA and NATO are sleeping 😌
The Kremlin has ideologically hammered Nazism into the heads of many Russians for more than 10 years. Today, many Russians perceive the attack on Ukraine as a defense of Russia and denazification. The Kremlin is now promoting the idea of empire, which should begin with the restoration of the Soviet Union and the destruction of NATO. The long-term idea is a complete victory over Europe and the USA.
Try to keep up BBC
#PutinMustDIE

Some of you saying why aren't other countries assisting? What can they do? Russia will start a nuclear war if other countries assist... and that will fuck all of us up, imagine all superpowers throwing nuclear bombs at each other. God be with all of us🙏
The bus service still operating ?
That's Ukrainian tank you hypocrites
Nato, a league of nations that did sod all when Hitler went on the rampage, wake up and put the beast down as talking will not help, next on the agenda another baltic state?

Ha ha ha where r THE yankee hiding.... Go go Russia Nuke the Ukraine n the USA...
Shame on you russia.
Thats Ukrainian armor
NATO was desperate for Ukraine to join even though the Russians warned than of severe consequences. The Ukrainian dictator chose a path he knew will hurt innocent civilians and normal people. And now NATO is nowhere to be seen.
Go Russia.. kill em all.
WHERE ARE YOU AMERICAN DEMACRACY, SUPPORT, AND SUPPLY? YOU ARE ONLY ALWAYS WORRING AND THAT IS ALL, AFTER UKRAINE EUROPE U WILL NEXT!
Respect to the Ukrainian president for not abandoning. especially in the capital.
Joe Biden = Neville Chamberlain
Rip Ukraine they fell ealrier then expected
Why aren't we doing anything? The entire world is just letting Russia do this, giving Russia the idea they can do as the please.
Russia are dead we will destroy them not physically but mentally destroying there economy but if we have to fight im already training my throwing knives and tactical mehods
So much for demilitarization
UKRAINE IS ON ITS OWN... NONE OF ITS ALLIES HELP NOT US NOT UK NOT NATO... NONE... UKRAINE STAND ALONE BETRAYED BY THEIR ALLIES!
Love Ukraine! 💛💙
The floating balls of light are illumination rounds not shot down aircraft
If they capture the Capital it's over.
Yes if the president leave the capital things with get back for them
this woman looks very sick.
That was quick.
Honestly shocked at the hypocrisy of western colonial powers.
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺❤️❤️
In this era, the true image remains vivid. Russians should continue to be resented by the world for decades to come.
We need to just get in there and crush putin and hand the government to the people.
Russia turns on it's nabour before it turns on him we must pray for peace it's only one human race
Refugees welcome in Scotland.
THE RUSSIA/UKRAINE CONFLICT PROVES THAT UNITED STATE OF AMERICA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, THE EUROPEAN UNION, ISRAEL, THE ROMAN CATHOLIC EMPIRE AS WELL AS AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN ARE NOW INSTIGATING GLOBAL WARS AGAINST RUSSIA, CHINA AND INDIA TO GAIN ULTIMATE CONTROL OF EUROPE, AFRICA, ASIA AND THE WORLD TOWARDS THE FULLFILMENT OF THEIR AGENDA OF "A ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT."
PUTIN IS A MURDERER !!!!
2:21 he sounds like Molotov.
UN council should take initiative against Russia and announce #Putin as a #WarCriminal Right now and urged America and NATO to fight for Ukraine against Putin.
BBC has never deviated from its main mission that is to be a British propaganda tool. All this feminine and emotional reporting sprinkled with mis and disinformation follows the long established tradition. How did that clown posing as Defense Minister count the Russian casualties? We saw the caliber of the clueless Foreign Minister already. Boris Johnson is a clown the whole world already knows about. What a joke.
Blow them up

"Airfield taken back by Ukrainians later during the day (yesterday)". This airfield is 30km from the capital's center. And this same media house reports that Russians are 9km from the capital' center alongside with armoured vechiles. If you are going to lie, at least do it right.
It was not Russian tank, it was Russian soldiers in our tank that they take over. It is second time when I see BBC News misinform. Looks like BBC News working on Russian side (((
Where’s the  Ukrainian army?
Look like there is no resistance, it's very difficult for tanks to enter urban areas with very sophisticated anti tank missiles with most nations
Seriously, Ukraine looks like the Middle East now! My heart truly aches!
surrender to stop the slaughter... people love to be delusional but when you are totally outgunned then it's just slaughter and not fighting
Nazi Ukrainian regime is on its last legs.
Wtf,how they're so fast to arrive already at the capital city😮
Ukraine should submit to Russia for the shake of its people and stop kissing NATO ass!! History suggest US, UK, France are dirty, they will never take a bullet for someone else.
Russia is evil. It brings nothing but death and destruction. After Ukraine, it may want to attack other countries too. Russia has to be stopped.
Russia should stand down
Arabs world it's time to kick out western companies controlling your oil!-dady vlad
If West is not sending troops to Ukraine to avoid nuclear war, then how it would be different when Russia want to occupy Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania . It would be same Russia versus same NATO . Would West take a risk of nuclear war because of piece of paper? ....Is piece of paper is more important than human life's and values????
This is military vehicle was stolen by Ukrainian soldiers who is drunk and driving through the City crashing the cars. Even Ukrainian social media said that.😅😂😂 you guys such a liars
Why Russia? Why?
The video from the university of Chicago about this crisis https://youtu.be/JrMiSQAGOS4
worst video ever with all old clips replayed, is this BBC?
Damn I'm tired of being right all the time. 2 or 3 days I said Wednesday.
As a Russian I feel ashamed but at the same time the West has had all opportunities and resources to integrate Russia into the West in the 90’s after collapse of the Soviet Union before Putin by ALL MEANS NECESSARY, nothing of these would have happened.
Where is NATO? Where are Polish tanks? We need to help them. WTF?!?!?!
NATO = No Action, Talk Only
USA wins . Now USA can sell gas and oil to EU . 🤐
alaska will be next
My heart to the soldiers, the civilians, and all those who just want peace. This should have been avoided in so many ways. There were options on the table... It is sad!!
Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him. Ezekiel 38:2  And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. Revelation 20:8   Josephus recounts the tradition that Gog and Magog were locked up by Alexander the Great behind iron gates in the "Caspian Mountains", generally identified with the Caucasus Mountains.   The Caucasus Mountains include the Greater Caucasus in the north and Lesser Caucasus in the south. The Greater Caucasus runs west-northwest to east-southeast, from the Caucasian Natural Reserve in the vicinity of Sochi, RUSSIA on the northeastern shore of the Black Sea to Baku, Azerbaijan on the Caspian Sea.
Putin is a murderer and really doesn’t care about the civilians and army personnel that have lost their lives because of the completely pointless action by Russia
The craziest thing is that this whole thing could have easily been avoided. Russia was only asking NATO not to expand east. Biden was like: I'll wait until Russia makes an irreversible move...hmmm yes
Ordinarily I'm not pro war, as the hope is that there is always a peaceful way out of it, but i think the time has come that the nations of the world need to step in, and I don't mean more sanctions, they are doing nothing. Force must be met with force. Imagine being punched in the face and people watching saying stop or we will take ur money away, or give u a harsh telling off and you will look bad. That is what we are doing. Most decent people seeing that would step in and stop the beating. This is what we need to do. Otherwise we are giving Putin a clear message that he can do this and the worst he will get from us is a slap on the wrist.
The West should hang its head in shame for not helping the Ukranians out. History will show how pathetic we were in their hour of need.
Can someone shout to United Nations that a war is going on here
what the bbc means: is,  russian tanks filmed for the media and probably by the media so they’ll have something to talk about.
I hope this war stop soon. And Russia will pay off what they did. Such a liars, they told millions of people they  didn't planning war. Now we see what it is ... Innocent people dying. Pls Stop the war ! We are all human
This is USA way, when they attack iRak 😄
Ask the NATO countries what they were doing....
I do not understand this ,from one side, you have reports of Ukranians fighting and inflicting huge loses to Russians, on the other side you see Russian tanks literally enter Capital of Ukraine on the video like its nothing ,  without any huge resistance from soldiers or civilians alike there is civilian bus driving behind tank.   So who is lying here?
Again it proved, Dont trust USA
Obama and Biden are to blame for this mess
The West is really going to allow this to happen. A sad day indeed
I blame Germany because they told Ukriane not to mobilize its troops to not offended Russia. WESTERN Europe have no spine bunch of weak pussies
Europe and US please help us, send in troops send in military equipment and help us defend democracy and European soil.
Writing was on the wall, along time ago. was plenty of time to negotiate😳😳😳😳

Putin crime
Taking the country is easy its holding on to the country after taking that's the real challenge.
Remember what you are seeing is propaganda.
I can put my life on it that the Ukrainian president is no longer in Ukraine. Why is he not putting on a tin hat and fighting. He's probably in Poland or with the Americans by now. About he isn't leaving.
What BBC should talk about is that all that could have been avoided if NATO signed deal with Russia that Ukraine Will Never join NATO. I guess they are Not allowed to do that 👎👎👎
cool.
People bar from leaving? That's a human right violations! Not everyone is a soldier, not everybody is able to shoot a gun, not everybody is attached emotionally with land of birth (I wasn't) .... If they wanna leave, they can... Fighting is a choice for civilians
Happened in hungary 1956 Czech 1968 Afghan 1979 The superpowers have the advantage!
Unreliable Negotiators
best thing for Russian soldiers is just sort their own country out!! taking control of Moscow and seizing the Kremlin 6-months you can have democracy. the Russian soldiers no it's an illegal war! ❤️🇺🇦
We are ready to shoot! Each of Russian  soldiers will be dead, wrapped into black package and returned home to their mother to mourn. We didn't invite them here! They are responsible for their actions, it's time to defend Ukraine!
7.000 ukrainians they came on foot in just 2 days towards Romania ! Can you image they literally left all their lives there , took their kids in arms and run from a war thei did not ask for  Incredible mobilisation from romanian people they offering house to stay is an outstanding response wich I am proud off ! Slava Ukraine
No  Action  Talk  Only
Armored vehicular are likely Ukrainian - it’s an AT launcher, not tank, plus Russians mark theirs with white paint
Ukraine: I literally need help here... NATO: The best I can do is more sanctions. Ukraine: I'm literally dying here! NATO: Have a nice day.
Shame, no resistance??? What America doing??? Seems Ukraine left alone
Defund the BBC
seems a bit strange to have so many of your troups in the south and not enough protecting the capital !!!!
They won.  🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
They beat the truckers to Washington! Took some doing.
Oooh let people to have a choice of leaving or staying, we live once..
Nah, everything is OK. This so called tank is already a history. Glory to Ukraine!
It is obvious that the Ukraine cannot beat Russia. It is obvious that no one will risk WW3 over this. Ukraine should surrender and stop the loss of life now. You cannot drive out evil with evil.
🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳WW3.5  THANK YOU BBC FOR YOUR PART!!!
Lord jesus christ we pray for our brothers and sisters in Ukraine....lord of peace hv mercy on us 🙏🙏🙏🕊🕊🕊🕊🕊❤❤❤❤❤
NATO- NO ACTIONS TALKS ONLY NASO-NO ACTIONS SANCTION ONLY.
FREEDOM for Ukraine 🇺🇦 & ALL of its’ citizens...😰 ...STOP ethnic cleansing by AZOF Battalion & RiGHT Sector !🙏
all this power and you cant stop putin. weak. just send like 20k troops right to his location bang dead. finished game over
The most interesting question right now is: do these tank stop at red traffic light?
Russia 🇷🇺 💪🇵🇹🥰
Во прикол показывают всу шную технику ,а выставляют русскими
That didn't take so long..  at this pace  Russia could invade another 2 or 3 countries by the end of next week
This was most likely a reconnaissance plane or a drone
"Ben Wallace": the Russian Ground Forces have failed to achieve it's objectives.  "BBC NEWS"  two hours later: *"Russian tanks move into Kyiv."*  lol. Just when one thought geopolitical embarrassment couldn't become any worse for 'Western leaders.'
so BBC has ignored the chelling and bombings of civilians in ukraine for 8 years, now when Russia has had enough and stoping the civil war BBC propaganda is that Russia is invading Ukraine... lol this is propaganda people, this war started 2014 because the west sponsored neo nazis to make a coup
More fake news it was not a missile you can't shoot a missile down with a tomahawk and Israel and America are the only two with missile defense Iron Dome
And the iron curtain comes down on Russia  Driving them back to there economic dark ages once again.
Russia is an occupier!We have to keep up with it!!! The next may be your country,so we have to unite and destroy our common enemy!
Where is NATO?  Will this escalate into a global conflict?  Russian will not back down.  Ukraine will be destroyed.
Trump  1. Peace with North korea 2.Serbia kosovo deals  3. No New wars 4.U.A.E, Baharain, sudan,Morocco recognized Israel  Biden Taliban occupied Afganistan Talibans using usa weapons left in Afganistan Failed to resolve Russia - Ukraine crisis   We did it Joe!
Meanwhile Biden is taking a nap with his babysitter.
Ukrainian people are learning a hard lesson, they did riots protests to remove past government in 2014 because it was inching towards Russia now Zelensky is inching towards west and see what happened.
How does BBC know that these are Russian armor vehicles in the video? It seems hazardous driving around with (Russian) vehicles in Kyiv without infantry support. It would be straightforward to take out with an anti-tank missile.
He wrote Z's on them so that we would know fake news from Real News
Urban fighting is coming
We're not fools there's knows he's on them that's why he wrote the letter z those are Ukrainian tanks sold to them and given to them years and years ago by Russia as they were part of Russia show me tanks with Z on them and I'll believe it
Just the innocents who suffer at the end. Instead of spreading goodness and safety to all human beings, humans are following the theory of Darwinism" survival of the fittest". How sad it is!!.  Stop Putin! 😡
Where's the Ukrainian Army?
I order all Russian troops to surrender immediately
They have a live 🇺🇦 Kiev camera, but not one of the 🇨🇦 Canadian truckers freedom convoy. - proving the press are against you.  WAKE UP. its a distraction. Putin is part of the WEF global currency plan. Putin meets Klaus 'cashless' Schwab on regular occasions.
Afghanistan and Taliban (USA weapon), Jammu and Kashmir (USA decision) and Russia and Ukraine (USA NATO) USA hidden evil 😈
Let’s go Brandon
Not looking good for soros and obiden's goons in kiev 😂
Having an ice cream?
Well nato have created this situation for the Ukrainians.
Please nato get forces in.
ahahahah lie lie lie 400 soldiers killed shut up! liers :P WE RUSSIA THE BEST
What is Biden doing ?
Where are the Ukraine fighters?
Please remember Afghanistan 🇦🇫.
Where the fuck is nato and America for whom Ukrain wanted to join Nato
What happens if Russia decides to drop a  nucular 💣   ???  Is that the start to World War 3 (  Or do they wanna invade and not destroy)
Putin being the hitler of the 21st century
