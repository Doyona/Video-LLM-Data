Michael i know you don't like BDSP but the 4 gen games where my favorite.I completely agree that the remakes suck but there a mod called luminescent platinum that corrects all bdsp's mistakes and it awesome 👌
No, Micheal, don’t do it!
The John Overlay as a clown is very funny!
How i got flygon in bdsp?
From one Michael to another. With the second/third floor thing the site which said second floor may have just been written by someone using British English rather than American English.  On the British side of the Atlantic we have a slightly different way of naming floors  First Floor (American) = Ground Floor (British) Second Floor (American) = First Floor (British) Third Floor (American) = Second Floor (British)  and so on.
Wish it was an actual series instead of many cuts and skips.
This game could've been so much better with literal minor tweaks. Idk why there are so many tiny things wrong
11:50 little did he know that, that old couple would’ve given him a Mew and a Jirachi💔🥀
TALK TO THE OLD COUPLE IN THE FLOWER TOWN!!! THEY GAVE ME A JIRACHI AND MEW!!
I'm playing my own playthrough with little to no knowledge about the story (but I played the original Pearl) and waited til gym 3 to look up playthroughs 😂
3:57. A BRA
I got a shiny geodude right before the first gym.
22:07  You could say it was ONIXspected
My name is Rowan
*Ignores piplup* *Destroys the regional bird starly* What happened to Team sky???😂
13:34 logic
We need more walkthroughs !
Time to rewatch the series again
11:49 angers me so much he could of gotten a JIRACHI [if he has sword and sheild save data] AND A MEW
the hatred towards BDSP is nowhere near valid
Look how happy you look Michael,  at least on the thumbnail, so funny to come back here to watch the series you shat on 😂
despite all the issues with these remakes, i'm happy to see you still enjoy playing through them.
Bro one of those older couples gives you a Jirachi 🤦🏼😂🤣🤣
You need a soothe bell to evolve a budew
Pachrisupersise me
I love how i just power-up punched my way through roark. Idk if i just got a godly nature or smth but i do remember just sweeping with a +6 chimchar.
I just played the game again and got chimchar so I tried to do the 1st gym with no starter evo and won
It is I!!!!!!!!!!!!! Random guy
''How does it ouspeed me!?'' Said to a purugly
Gruntyboi I don’t want to play raid shadow legends
You didn't want to get your free Mew?! lol
"I'm so excited about Raid Shadow legends who am I gonna tell" Looks at us "I'll tell you" Whilst I'm there like NOOOOOOO
Why does he look happy in the thumbnail, as if we all enjoyed playing this game.
Bro broke Grunty Boi's heart by ignoring him
How to you get gliscor pre post game ?
they should have table for arm wrestling
Why did the starly look shiny
I’m not trying to flex but BEFORE the second gym i got a full odds shiny geodude and i’m still happy about it
I can't tell the defend between male and female turtwing ?
Yahdah Yahuah Yahusha for life
you can get mew and jiarachi from the old couple
22:49
Ok that “finally my hat!” Got me laughing.
Oh my God I just realized that you’re the reason I say pachurisu like that. 😅
poketch? not poketech?
Ur wrong, empoleon is the best starter.   JK u can like who you want to like!
im not exactly a fan of sinnoh as a whole so i was already apprehensive to watch this mini series, but then you picked chimchar, an i cant watch anymore of this. i dont dislike your content, just sinnoh and the infernape line(as well as almost anything wukong related)
I actually prefer Barry in Diamond, Pearl and BDSP over Platinum. He's a lot more likeable
"Piplup? NO!" me: i am insulted :(
Mikeys reaction when he found abra made me die
Fun fact, I got a heracross on the first honey tree. I was so stunned and course it made my team
Mikey naming pokemon after real things like hemlock and me who  names pokemon random stuff like raman
12:03  PACHIRISU!
The old couple can give you Jirachi and Mew
How dare you pick chimchar!!!!!!!😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
Why does gruntyman sound like that?
/rest in peace Turtwig, the best sinnoh starter
If you say puff of the za za i will subscribe
1:21 😂 OMG I loved his reaction to the stupid hat!!
Grunty Boi ad start: 4:45 *Grunty Boi ad end:* 7:01 (although it seems like Mikey was still playing mid-ad but whatever) Thank me (and send death threats) later.
THUD = oof
Clefairy
"The water is so wet"
Is there somewhere I can watch this as a full play through without it being just the highlights?
One day, one of bidoof’s dex entries would talk about some people rendering it as a pest (with reference to PLA), then some would worship it as a deity, with reference to… you know
I know that Mikey makes a video about his complaints with BDSP after the playthrough, and I understand his concerns about these games considering the others that he’s played. But the fact that brilliant diamond is my first Pokémon game….mmmmmMMM
1:06 that's what i pick MIkey
I’ve never played this gen I have no clue what starter I would pick
GLISCOR IS MY FAVORITE POKÉMON!
11:50 You missed a frickin' MEW. Talk to the old woman in the old couple and you could've had a MEW.
I just got the game and already have a shiny zubat no joke
Screw this whole video, MACHOP HAS A TAIL?
I am an adult five seconds later am I a child again
Hay Mikey will pokemon ever get X and Y remakes like pokemon eternal X and withering Y that would be awesome
i played pokemon brilliant diamond and the man of the happy couple and the old man gave me a jirachi
Y
I have one question do you have pokemon sword or shield or let's go Eevee or Pikachu if you do u can get 2 MITHYCALS WITCH ARE MEW AND JARACHI
Just found this channel. I praise the Lord and the Algorithm gods for blessing me with such find. Currently binging all your videos, btw, love the beard. Please keep it up. Great content!!

"She looks so tired" She is just the average mom.
3:59 yo Mikey what do some woman wear to keep the breast’s in place
Chad purplecliffe

And a good reason to choose chimchar it has type advantage over the first 3 gyms and learns good tms
pokemon mand jtv
Bruh I named my shinx X-Ray!
Wow, this is the first time he didn’t shiny hunt in a Pokémon game
nah ther's rock below the water on the cave water encounter background
my nickname is sandy and scythers one of my favorite pokemon
when you he said he wanted to run into a shiny i went back to my memorie  of finding a shiny machop on my first day of having the game
I like you your just worried about the battle arena and not magikarp
One time me and my friend made a joke about it being Team Galactic policy for all the grunts to have bowl cuts
why does everyone saws that purugly is so hard I one short it when I tryed
All of mwachops evolutions have tails but the belt covers it up
11:30 I can still here Purplecliffe “sheeeesh”
My bedew evolved today i caught for my second pokemon i was sooo Surprised
Dont know How it was possible but in my game some Old lady gave me Mew Why did she do that 😂
Go to that cuppell to get jarrah Chi jarrah Chi

I got a impish gligar  is that good
"The water looks so wet!" John Michael ... , November 2021.

Purple clff if he sees the ralts THICC GARDIVOR
STOP INTERUPTING ME that got me laughing lol
Grunty Boi ain’t happy.
I remember when I was trying to catch a Murkrow in the underground, I found a level 37 murkrow that knows brave bird! And I failed to catch it.😪
Why don't u like empoleon ?
5:40 just realized Grunty-boi said poytions 😂
fun fact the starly that mikey fought was shiny
What’s wrong with a torrterra and a gliscor on the same team? I have both and I’m only using ground types for my own Evil team… TEAM DIRT
The “pachirisu” and the way said it got me rolling in laughing! Thank you for that!
Anakin hates sandgem town
Did anyone else notice "something" about those howler monkeys
Its a brah! Dude its an abra Bruh HOLD UP BRUH IS LIKE BRA
who is grunty boy i wonder?
My favorite shiny Pokémon is charzard
What is your favorite shiny Pokémon?
I named my rival trash boi
Legendaries
The old couple you can get
I was playing shining pearl and then a few hours later I found A shiny Gligar end it was low enough level for me to transfer to my shining pearl and obey me as I only had six badges and I beat the game with it in my party helped me a lot with fire fang and thunder thing
I found it so funny that he didn’t talk to the old couple and the the free jirachi and mew
If you talk to the old people standing in the flowers you get level 1 Jirachi and Mew
Talk to oldcouple for a mew and jirachi if you have a sword and shield progress and lets go
I actually subscribed when you told me to lol
I was playing another run through bd and the first gym I had a chimchar that just got like plus 10 attack from power up punch
I love your vids so much keep it up
I am saddened because I am piplup user
You can get a mew and jirachi if you played pokemon let's go and pokemon swsh
12:04
How do you JOKT assoscuate him as Barry when people order our Pattie’s
I nearly screamed when he just left the old couple in Floroma. If you have saves of sword/shield and let’s go pikachu/eevee you can get a jirachi and mew
12:45
I found like 2 random shinies in my first play through. I always find like 1 random shiny
Gligar is exclusive in bd
Having gameplay sprinkled throughout the sponsor is a great way to improve retention hehe
Its a braaaaa
By the way you can get a gallade all you have to do is battle Fantina get the relic badge go back through Mount corenet I don't know how to spell it rock smash your way through go up the staircase and surf and then there will be a Poké Ball that's the John Stone you can use a gallade
Drifloon Battle team galactic next Friday drifloon in Valley Windworks if you battle team galactic on a Friday you have to wait till the next Friday
I put this play on the background while I grind.
7:00 your welcome
ℑ𝔱'𝔰 𝔞 𝔟𝔯𝔞
You can get mew and javari from old man and woman just me
I used empillion he was great 👍
you can get it with the cuople
you missd mew...
Wright when you said chimchar I clicked off
Where is part 2 and so on?
Those cupel If you played let’s go Pikachu then I’ll give you mew and you played sword and shield they would give you Geraci
Michael you completely ignored and forgot about Grunty boy
I feel like the ad would be funnier if the Micheal just walks in with a cup of coffee and Grunty boi is just extremely confused
One of my biggest regrets is reseting my save file, cause it didn't occur to me until it was too late that I will no longer be able to get the Manaphy egg or the platinum style clothing anymore
Why did that starly at the start look.. shiny?
If he would have talk to the old couple he would have been so surprised
Cool!
Why his only sponsor is raid shadow legends?
Mikey makes sponsors fun
I just watch people play pokemon while I play pokemon shield doing the battle tower or tournaments
Mikey: “I know it’s unrealistic, but I really want a random shiny.” Me: **Finds a random shiny Geodude within an hour of playing the game**
I may be 11 but can I be part of team sky
I literally have no idea why they make TMs breakable again, maybe because the nostalgia to the original game or make it not too easy to get new moves. But they have made TMs unbreakable since gen5 and there’s no any f*cking reason to return to that bullsh*t again. I’m so mad at this even I haven’t played the game yet. The removal of HMs is just a disguise and they make us excited for nothing.
Here now, Grunty Boi, out of the entire world population, according to my statistics, 0% out of 100% asked.
Oh yeah, speaking of Skorupi, I just got a shiny Skorupi in Pokemon Legends Arkoos! Hail Yeah!
And Mikey missed the special mew and jirachi by talking to the old couple
I imagine Barry’s Mom would be tired often having to deal with a kid like that.
Now i get to wait 6 hours... for a wurmple 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Do you have a minute to talk about our lord and savior Bidoo- I mean Arceus
2nd floor in serebii is correct, in the UK it goes ground floor, 1st floor then 2nd floor 👌🏻 just a dialect confusion
So I beat my game of shining pearl awhile back and have to say, I honestly prefer platinum on the ds just because the legendary and the full Pokédex make the game a lot more fun in my opinion
6:45 I scanned that qr code in ultra sun just for fun and got Snivy's dex entry
The old couple give you mew and jirachi
Wait chinoru is good I got her during the s1mple event and I use her Goddamn not even one of my two legendarys they are ninja and s1mple
I named myself Michael in diamond
For some reason I can’t find this video in my computer but I can find it on my phone, please help
Michael you could have just used rock smash with monferno it ohkos Roark’s every pokemon except cranidos (Cranidos takes 2 rock smash)
7:29 *wack*
Can I just say how much I appreciate the fact that you took the time to caption these videos? Autocaptions usually make a terrible mess out of anything Pokemon-related, so the fact that this video has been captioned manually is a huge deal. I'm deaf and you've just gained a new subscriber and huge fan.
Do more team sky
I named my shinx X-ray too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Anyone realised that the starly was shiny
Is it just me or is it weird that fire is red and fighting is orange?
What do you mean the less cool kind of shellos 😢
wow
WAOT SHINX HAS THUNDER SJOCK OFF THE BAT. The ai on my game is stupid then. I'm doing a water only nuzlock of shining pearl. Cause it's the one I have and no shinx or pachirisu have used electric moves wild or owned.
barry more like Mr.Thud
Michael forgot that purugly is faster than latios
Got my 1st starter shiny on my 12th encounter
Got my 1st shiny starter at the start on my 12th encountering was turtig
Abra: Has energy ball early. Also Abra: Has great speed and special attack (105 spattack) Me: *Scared*
15:18 In platinum it is even more of a domination Monferno is great against Roark Great against Gardenia Immune to the Duskull's Will-O-Wisp and resists Magical Leaf(one of the most powerful moves of Mismagius) Great against Meylene's ace Lucario Weak to Wake's whole team Great against Byron,Roark's daddy Great against ...(i don't wana fall for that damned joke) Can do good against Volkner, if you run Dig on Infernape which most people don't do because they rather have a Garchomp..If not then neutral damage  Great against Aaron Bad against Bertha and Lucian Great for healing up during Flint(can stall out turns) and again good if you run Dig Great for Cynthia's Lucario and Roserade Man Sinnoh was made to make you feel this Raging Fire Monkey is overpowered Even the anime focused completely on the Super Saiyan mode of Infernape
1:07 am I bugging or is that Starly a shiny
Lmao I named my chimchar chimichanga
I just found a full odds shiny peleper on accident while surfing to the Pokémon league
The old couple gives you jirachi and mew
i am the basic white boy....Mikey 2021
more like f
team galactic grunts should be calld team bowl cut grunts or just call the team team owl cut not including trhe ppl named aFTER OPLANETS
Wow, finding Gligar, which I believe is a rare spawn in the first underground levels, twice and both have modest. That is terrible luck and I am only slightly bad that I laughed for a few minutes when you showed that.
In the original games I hunted a shiny combee for 2 months and I got a shiny male first but I continued for another 1 and a half months and got a shiny female
I played Pokemon Diamond as a kid. And I remember clearly that I only understand half of what it says in the games. Since the games never got an translation release.
Whitney the ice gym leader is so easy to fight.
I love you
Hey my name is Rowan!
Was that starly shiny ✨  the one he fought after he stole the chimchar
Wait did they add power up punch to Infernape 😳
It is Rowan not Rowun
I tried to hunt for a good natured Gible in my Shining Pearl playthrough, and out of the, like, **15** I caught, I got two total natures. And even then, all but 1 had all the same nature.  Though I guess the game made it up to me before that even happened, because I had gotten my first wild shiny ever (a Kadabra)
As of 2-6-22 I still haven't seen a Gligar...
Mikey you are so lucky getting the pre order quick balls because I didn't, I found roselia and the stupid flower wouldn't get in the pokeball because thats all I had
Michael:I only associate this guy with Barry Also michael:People Order Our Patties
spends so much time finding gligar, can't evolve until after the elite four
Is Godzilla's legendary is something order that Pokemon you wanted was legendary or something
Can you buy me Pokemon brilliant diamond
I was just walking in a cave and found a shiny geodude
I named my chin char munkee
That is me
3:58 It's a bra 👹👹
Grunty man
I love how he just got a gorgeous stone box so early on and didn't even know it was rare
I personally love empoleon and hate tortera but I can see the opposite
11:56 to 12:05 was some of the funniest things I’ve seen on your channel hilarious!
"Can't be playing a Pokémon game without a hat"  *cries in Sword and Shield's medium and wavy hairstyle for male protagonist, which makes it impossible for you to wear a hat *
Grunty boi, where did that beard come from?
His first statue was a shiny and he did not realize
Fun fact: if you have played let’s go on the same device and then talk to the old couple in flouroma town they will give you a free Mew.  Hope this helps :)
Well you choose turtwig as your starter in a new brilliant diamond play through?
I’m playing brilliant diamond and I keep running into geodude

For some reasin "Viva Las Vegas first try!" made me snort-laugh like an idiot. I can't even say why
little did he know.. he missed a free mew and jirachi
As a tribute to your playthroughs, I’m using a gallade that I evolved from a lvl 50 ralts I found in the grand underground! HAIL YEA!
barry's mom is definitely sedated.
He should of talked to the the elderly couple to get mew jirachi
I'd love it if Grunty Boy appeared in a non-sponsored video and was just like "Oh....t-there's no sponsor? Oh......okay then! Ta-ta!"
It made me so mad when you didn’t get the mew and jirachi 😭
Idk why I feel that old couple were prepearing to die and Michael just ruined it 🤣🤣🤣😅😅😅😂😂😂
The dark type gin lider Mikeyis trying to take control
Plllssss micheal make grunty boi play pokemon red team rocket edition
Talk to the old couple in floraroma town and they give you you something
I oveleved a little to much and had a level 28 prinplup before the fist gym
Talk with old PPL from town Floaroma because they give you Mew and Jirachi
You should do again deadly rank gyms and comprising to IRL gyms with BDSP
The old couples give mew and Jirachi if you have Pokemon lets go (Pikachu,Evee) and pokemon sword or shield once you get the wishing stars
Did you know the old couple gives you a Mew and a Jirachi
Lol I got a shiny Ponyta out of nowhere after no hunting, but there was no damn point in using it as I picked Infernape as my starter.
easy to become my favorit poketuber
I named my scyther Edward a simple name too I named it after the old movie Edward scissor hands
Hi
Beard isn't as epic as mine yet lol 😆
"can't play pokemon without a hat." Brendan: *And i took that personally*
Named my starter after you
When I first played through this game I never ran into a shiny but my brother first play through of this got a shiny Piplup and my first was on a different version and it was Bidoof
1:38 BARRY STOP BUMPING INTO PEOPLE!

I got a shiny magikarp 2nd fish
Fell out of chair when he ignored the couple that literally gives you the Jesus of pokemon besides Jesus Entei
If you talked to that old couple you will get a jirachi

Anybody notice that Barry looks like Croissant head (saturn) IS BARRY EVIL!
I am haunted by the lakes soundtrack
the old cupler gives you mew and jersey
I wanted a male Gligar and it took 10 to get one male, and I named mine Stealth!
Walking past the old couple was slightly annoying they give you mew an jirachi
He said one bad thing about raid shadow legends now it's like his only sponsor
I choosed from chimchar
Can't believe mikey got a shiny statue that fast
It annoys me so much seeing him skip mew and jirachi and him just saying “oh look an old couple”
when he fought roark he didnt need monferno, he couldve just swept with level 13 Chimchar cause using Power-Up-Punch ups attack and if he used it the entire fight he wouldve won either way cause i one hit his Cranidos with a power up punch.
The thing about choosing Infernape is that you need to evolve your Chimchar before the first gym. Although his Cranidos can be difficult to defeat at lower levels my Shinx still came in clutch with a paralysis and flinches.
First time playing shining pearl i had a pacharisu that would shred other teams until I replaced it after 7th gym with Garchomp (currently gabite)
I chose chimchar too
Purugly is quicker than latias and latios
I also have 2 Premier Balls😏   I bought 24 Pokéballs in BD
When he said him and monfernape were Jesus I thought of ludachrist
The old couple in floaroma town gave me a freaking mew
11:48 the couple give you free mythics
On route 210 I found a my first shiny✨ and it was full odds and I it was a ponyta I named it blue flame
I personally got shining pearl if you did get the game wich version did you get
When Dawn forced me into the catching tutorial, I had already caught a Starly and I was laughing my head off
That old couple  in floaroma town gives u mew and jirachi go back go back (if u have let's go /sword save files)
If you talk to the old lady in florma town you get a mew
My chimchar’s name is Arson 😂😂 I don’t know why but it’s tradition for me to always go fire type  and name it Arson
He missed jirachi and mew in floroma town..  Edit: but noticed the ppl who gave them too you (the old couple incase you didnt know) ^_^
Ignoring grunty boiii again 😔
Barrys mom is tired :/  Think its barrys fanatic energetic squirel brain lol
the old people has a jirachi
Mikey I have a torterra glisgor and a garchop
Why did he not get mew and jirachi
for those who play SP yo can legit get a jirachi before the second gym XDDDDD
So you can trade me
Me taking down purugly with a staravia who knows double team
Before: purugly is as fast as latios and latias  Now: how is this purugly faster
I beat roark with piplup named Emperor
Fun fact: if you talk to the old couple you get a mew and a jirachi
the fact he went " We are monke jesus" got me crying laughing 🤣
Why do you cut every 5 seconds oml i hate your videos were you do that
What if Grunty Boi had Yakkos voice
11:48 I don’t know if you knew, but if you talk to the old man, he will give you a freaking JIRACHI!
when I talked to the old lady I got a mew
Mikey: We can't be playing a Pokémon game without a hat... SuMo and SwSh: Am I a joke to you?
CHIMCHAR GETS LOVE
I found a gible in  the underground
Chose the same starter

He mikey you Gan battle dawn in post gema
Was the starly in the beginning shiny?
How dare you knock out a cat
Well that cat for some of odd reason is faster than latios and latias
Hi I'm new to your channel awesome videos keep up the work man
Barry’s mom isn’t tired  She is sad
AWWW WHY DO TMS BREAK AGAIN
I love you vids
I was replaying pokemon platinum while watching this
How about everyone counts how much people chose a starter that wasn't chimchar. You can safely bet your life that it's lower than 25
Grungy boy: Talking about raid shadow legends Michael: *C O A L*
I’m sad cuss I don’t have Brilliant Diamond so I’m stuck with Sword. 😭
Nice beard
My budew is level 33 and still hates me
*sad event happens to me*  "Haha it is I, Grunty Boy" Me: Eternal happiness
I shall Dub deed Grunty Boi Steve
I got a random shiny before
When they still make you do the catching tutorial after catching pokemon
Its nice to see Game Freak pushing the limits on the Nintendo switch 🙄
The old couple at 11:50 have a jurachi and a mew
Finally someone playing shining diamond or the Pearl that has good taste and a starter Pokemon
I'm getting pokemon Brilliant diamond for Christmas!
Excuse me I named my Gilgar NightWing are you coping
Why does this man hate the friendship evolution so much?? Can someone please tell me???
In America grunty boi annoys Mikey. In Soviet russia Mikey annoys grunty boi
Aww an old couple how cute  *sweating*
Fun fact: my first and only shiny pokemon was in the original pearl game. I found a shiny shinx (probably spelling the wrong) just before the 2ed gym, but didn't know what shiny pokemon were so I was just like "OOOOOOO YELLOW SHINX!" And thought it was the coolest thing because yellow is my favorite colour and shinx is one of my favorite pokemon. I lost it tho because I was playing on my brothers game and he asked for It back and only after I deleted the data did I mention to him the yellow shinx. -_- I was a dumb child
I simp for bearded Mikey
Name your rival 'stupid' 😆
Wow when did he grow a beard
Imagine getting a random shiny as your first encounter in a nuzloke that is a starly then getting it to level 29 then it dies from a double battle against a kadabravwhonuses phsybeam and a garden who uses waterfall. Could be me because it happened to me and I released it then saved the game
John Cena plays and I die of laughter
Mandjtv: "Oh look a couple how cute" Doesn't realize their purpose
I was shocked to find out the old couple he passed gave me a damn mew and jirachi in the start
Little would Mikey know that him not choosing turtwig as a starter would come back to bite him in the butt in literally the next episode.
It kinda triggers me that he was like “hehe old couple* and doesn’t talk to them even though they give you a free mew and jirachi
I planed for ninwtales and found out after the second gym I need nat dex but I found a shiny dustox
My rosellia was a budew and it had only died twice
I thought about un subbing when he picked the chimchar
Rick gastly the gastly
If I download raid shadow legends this sponsor will be the reason I do. Absolutely brilliant
mandjtvs wallet if grunty boy didn't exist 0$
i was gonna pick piplup until i watched the anime i just loved chimchar after that
I guess you could say that micheal was too enGROTHed in pokemon to notice grunti boi
Sandgem town  Anakin : But I don't like SAND *triggered*
My brother-in-law played for thirty minutes and got a shiny machoke
I named my Chimchar “Sun Wukong”, since that’s what Infernape is likely inspired after  EDIT: I call him “Sun Wu”
Noooo!!! They took away the Tm repeats?
,
Barry’s mom smokes way too much before the game’s release😂
you can't play pokemon without a hat
I had to battle Roark twice to get the first badge. I only had Monferno and Bidoof. His Cranidos did lots of damage after using Screech and lowering my Defense. Thankfully his Cranidos has Mold Breaker so my Bidoof’s Defense only got lowered one stage per Screech instead of two. Yes my Bidoof, now Bibarel, has Simple.
What old couple?
"You've probably heard of raid" YES, I HAVE! AND I'D PREFER NOT TO EVER AGAIN
Hal ya
0:23 lol
I just bought BOTH BD and SP. I’m so HAPPY! I didn’t want to watch ur gameplay because I didn’t want to be spoiled. Now I’m watching your gameplay with Brilliant Diamond WHILE playing it. Awesome!
if you catch a Bidoof in a HM game use it as a HM slave and name it HM Slave
Mikey: "I am a grown man." Grunty boi: "He's 27!!!!!"
...why DOES Machop have a tail?
The difference between normal and shiny status is that the shiny ones provide a bigger buff.
The old couple gave you mew and. Jriachi you know that right
Purguly is faster than latios and latias THAT DOSE NOT MAKE SENSE
Piplup and Turtwig are underated I haven’t seen a single poketuber use Turtwig or Piplup
shave
Who's gonna tell him that Gligar's evolution item is postgame?
You can go to the flower town and talk to the 2 old people and they will give you mew and jirachi
Omg John Cena bit was unexpected xD I ROTFLd
Turtwig all the way.  GROTLE GANG, ARISE!!
Since when do you have a beard???????
Mike...the Empoleon hater...
I love how he said i want a random shiny and i came across a random shiny budew when i played lmao
I mean, grungy boy is talking about a garbage mobile game when Michael is playing a brand new Pokémon title, what did we all expect 🤷‍♂️
You should get a shiny gliscor for your team
You didn’t get the jirachi and mew
Aaaaaahhhhh
wait....you didn't talk to the old couple in the flowery town?.....the old couple that give you a free mew and free jirachi...
I love turtwig  But chimchar is still a good choice
I think you need to shave man you look like you have chocolate all over your face
I spent like 2 hours getting my gligar.   Worth.
how do you get the gligar
your beard its cool
Wait you're playing BD right? How did you encounter a Houndoom? Thought that was exclusive too SP?!!
I am glad i wasn't the only one surprised to not see Cyrus and then remembered that Cyrus at the Lake is in Platinum XD
I chose chimchar to!!and shinx to!!!!
Dude I literally when I was in the forest I found a shiny warm pool
Would it be mean to tell Mikey that I got a random shiny Starly before I got to Oreburgh?
There is no such thing as a bad nature/personality when it comes to Pokemon rather it's bad trainers!
The old couple has legendary pokemon talk to them
Mikey the old couple gives you mew and jirachi
I had a random shiny Starly before getting to sandgem, I was devestated.
Monferno and Mikey standing on the water = LUDACHRIST!!!!
His first statue is shiny😭 ive been searching for one for so long😭
That old couple gives you mythicals😂
Anybody find out if gligar evolves during the playthrough or is it strictly post game
I came back to his channel and man looks like a lumberjack
Go get mew and jirachi
Whats the issue with Torterra + Gliscor?
I was holding off on watching this until I played it for myself
Mikey to Purugly: "How are you faster than me?" Me: *remembering back to an old video of Mikey's about surprising Pokemon stats where he has Purugly zooming past Latios in the thumbnail*
Dude plz let us see walkthrough without skip and ur large face covering half of the screen
I’m pretty sure that the us catchable starly at the start of the game was shiny
The old couple give free mew
Mikey, the "old couple" in floroama town give you Jirachi
I forgot to subscribe
I would've preferred if you didn't just skip too much
Anyone else gotta wait for christmas? 😔😔😔
Ah yes the *"Todays video is sponsored by Raid Shadow Legends"*
Already beat the game it’s fun
4:35 i  got a shiny pontya in floccessy ranch(if thats the correct name) in platinum unexpectldy and mistakenly released it ;-; after evolving it into rapidash....
OMG DID U NAME THE SKORUPI “DEATHSTALKER” BC OF KIPO?
PachirisuUu is forever burned into my mind
Did anyone notice that the Starly at the beginning was a shiny?
Ad ends at 7:01 nothing happens during Ad.   F*** Raid Shadow Legends.
The old coulpe gives you a mew
Not only did no shave November change Mikey’s and Grunty Boi’s beards but also their attitudes: Mikey no longer notices Grunty Boi’s existence and Grunty Boi no longer steals Mikey’s stuff.
Sorry that the purrugly is faster then Latias and latios
Will you do a play through 😢
the old people you said about the boy gives you a jirachi and the girl gives you a mew
You actually can still polish the gym badges but it's touchscreen only. It's a really nice touch.
It took me like 10 try’s to beat the first gym since I also started with chimchar and all I had was that a starly and a shinx so I had to just hope shinx would flinch using bite the geodude with rollout and the onix to preserve chimchar and starly to try and o-ko the cranidos, it sucked
The old couple has to have a backstory somehow on how they have two legendary Pokémon 😂
Your Chimchar evolved at the same exact point as mine
Wow, he's grew a mustache and beard, he no looks like he's 17 lol
1:09 that would be very painful to it because bird bones are hollow
If you talk to the old people in floroma town you get a mew and jirachi
Bro why do you always look like your wife’s boyfriend just bought you a switch?
If only he talked to the old couple then he could have gotten 2 mythicals before the second badge
How do you grow a beard in two weeks
How come my accounts unsubbed I didn't do that lucky I type name in search and why didn't this guy get the mew :/
I feel like it’s easier to level up your Pokémon on this one cuz my Infernape is level 58 before I got into vilter
It’s funny how instead of using music from brilliant diamond and shining pearl he uses the sword and shield battle music in the background
Ze Beird it beautiful
its amazing that you find the gligar so fast i had to exit and re-enter a cave for an hour before i found even one
Anyone notice that a lot of things clip in this game?
That Gligar hunt is everyone's nightmare scenario. Searching for a rare spawn that has a good enough nature AND the ideal ability.
INFERNAPE SUPREMACY
I actually have a good friend named Teighler and its spelled like that
Is no one gonna talk bout that beautiful beard
I see that Michal has a beard.
Yep driftfloon only spawns fridays after beating galactic. Make matters worse the only trainers that use it are trainers in the ghost gym meaning you can miss the encounters and be unable to get the national dex for a week. And like EVERYTHING in the post game is locked behind the national dex
That old couple gives you jirachi 11:50
Back in the town where you got honey, that elderly couple that you walked by give you a pokémon
you should have talked to the couple trust me
Me while watching this video: 50% on the actual gameplay 50% of Michaels facial hair gain
The ‘Serebii mistake’ about the floor wasn’t a mistake, it’s just a difference between British and American way of assigning floors (brits go ground, 1st, 2nd instead of 1st, 2nd, 3rd) and since it’s ran by a Brit, it’s written in that format 👍
Bruh, Mars is built like a plunger
Fairy ain’t in this gen
Can you get a shiny before the second gym?
11:32 - Must be from Utah, lol
The beard/stubble is fire btw!
The starter that I have selected is……  Turtiwg
Jesus christ mikey 🤣 that 💫beautiful💫 beard caught me off gaurd 😳
Also if y’all talk to the old man next to the old lady , you will also get a Jirachi.  But I’m freaking out here , cuz I jus got that.
Hey everyone,  Did y’all know , that we all can get a Mew from an old lady in floramora town….?  Cuz I jus got that.
By the way Mikey I love your channel and no hate
Mikey: I might as well catch bidoof for the dex Me: little did he know he doesn’t have to catch it he just needs to see it in battle for it to register in the dex…
teighler is an irish spelling, and for some reason Owen is spelled Eoghan
10:02 **Ludachrist intensifies**
Does anyone know if you delete save game after getting mew and jirachi if can get them again in the new save? Cause if can find out then will promise to subscribe 🙂
I’m wondering if Looker is gonna be here in BD.  Who else is wondering about that….?
I am choosing chimchar as my starter and I want to know what the best move set for infernape is. All help is appreciated
Legit every YouTube I know that is playing this game chose chimchar
DID EVERYBODY MISS THE SHINY STARLY
I need help to glitch the razor claw in how do I do it? And I’m on my moms phone cuz she took mine so I need help quick
Mikeyyyyyyy the old couple hands out free mythical Pokémon you can get a jirachi and a mew from them
The old couple gave you mew and jirachi if you played let’s go an got wishing stars from galar
3:22 Why don't you like Rivalry? And so lucky! It took five Shinxs to get a Male with Rivalry.  16:42 How'd you get a Shiny one immediately?  22:39 No duh. I spent 4 hours in the Underground trying to find a Houndoom that did not have Early Bird. His Nature raised Defense but lowered Speed which I was completely fine with.
Too bad this Chimchar isn’t Ludachrist, or it would’ve fit really well with the battle against Magikarp
11:48 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
BRUHHHH U SHOULD HAVE TALKED TO THE OLD LADY AND THE OLD MAN CUZ THEY GIVE YOU JIRACHI AND MEW
I'm gonna use a infenape and gliscor
*immediately unsubscribes for the Piplup*
What do u mean why is it faster than me purugly is faster than latios and latias
My team rn is prinplup Staravia Jirachi crobat pachirisu and croagunk
I got diamond too
Never and I mean  NEVER ignore grunty Boi ever.
Hehehe do a nuzlocke again hehe
I chose chimchar too
Chimchar id literally the worst choice
11:50 This pains me, he was so close to getting that Jirachi and Mew
I always used to name the rival Mike Tyson
Am I the only one who thought when they were younger that Geodude evolved into onix.
While I'll agree that Budew is awful to evolve i've been finding it useful for selecting Pokémon with good abilities.  Use worry seed and it will tell you what ability it has before it changes to insomnia.  And I feel you on the bad nature of the glisor.  My starter Chimchar had a TIMID nature!! Ugh!
If you talk to the old couple (The women) you will get Mew if you played Let's go. (The man) you would get Jirachi.
Please stop cutting and editing just do the playthrough.
Mikey: *playing a game while talking* Grunty boi: STOP INTERUPTTING MEE!!!!
NOOOO, HE PICKED CHIMCHAR. YOU’RE KIDDING.
Go to the old couple you get jirachi and mew if you have sword or shield and let’s go evvee or pikachu
I haven’t watched Mikey in a while and I come back AND HE HAS A BEARD?!
I caught my first random shiny last night and it was an second encounter unknown
Your note saying I’ve been stuck in the hideaways your area for days
Oh no! Samantha! They’re never gonna let us go back to the zoo now! We let the howler monkey take shots again!
Not trying to be rude by the constant cutting and crap makes it really agrivating to watch when you just wanted to see the game.
that was a shiny statue
You can't evolve your gligar till post game unfortunately
Can I just say, Mikey was already handsome but damn this man looks great with a beard
Drifloon doesn't start to appear until after you defeat Team Galatic
haven watched MandJTv got surprised of the beard
This is my first time seeing Mikey and his beard. I’m… conflicted.
BRO I WAS GONE FOR LIKE A YER AND YOU WENT AND GOT A FUCKING BEARD
haha" It's so moist" i love it! ^_^
Can’t get gliscor until post game I wanted one too
If you talk to the lovely old couple in Floroma Town they will give you a mew and Jirachi if you have Sword and Shield and the Lets Go games.
The beard is looking great! :D
When Mikey sang he actually kinda sounded like a Persona 5 song
You ever notice it's called a town map, but it's of the region?
0.0 how was i not subbed I've watched you for years'
Wait... was that...?    PERRY THE PLATYPUS?!?!
To people who understand this reference  Grunty Boi reminds me of Remus and Logan Sanders sometimes-
When will you shave
Pleas shave! 🙂
I like how he didn't even care about his starter in the early game he just cared about his amazing HAT!!!!!
I spent a long time trying to get Houndoom for my team, and the best one I found had an Adamant nature instead of Modest.  So I decided to try a Physical-attacking Houndoom from an egg.
weewee
Not a Piplup fan? unsubscribed
Wait did he say the water is wet
"UGH, TAH TAH!!!!!"
even in the wild bidoof are HM slaves
It’s the Friday after you beat team galactic and I got a shiny ponyta randomly during my play through
Let’s goooooo
Barry is a stupid name.  My rival’s name is BUTTMONKEY.  Yes, with all caps, that’s very important.
They reached a good balance of shared xp, xp boosts from participating in battle, and catching Pokemon (instead of losing out on xp).  I’m liking it a lot so far.
Cant wait for the next episodes
Bros it's so weird to see Mikey with face hair
I got a mini heart atttack when I saw his new beard...         My brain: HWAT IS MANDJTV'S FATER DON HAIR?
12:53 😘
cant wait to get mine for Christmas
Surrender to the Sinnoh Slog!
Teighler is from Utah.
BEARDY BOI
CEEP it up mat pls me and my brother loves the content
Talk to the old couple, you’ll see why when you do
Why does Mikey and grumpy boy have a beard
OK I HAVENT WATCHED U IN AGES, BUT AINT THE BEARD GOING A LIL BIT... TOO FAR???
I'm upset he got a gorgeous stone box first try
Why don't you use pachirisu as your electric type? Just for a chance
Great ad read
I love the sponsor interruption part😂
I'm curious  about what they did to the gts station?
It is good he picked chimchar because it is the best sinnoh starter according to michael himself
mand jtv is giga chad confirmed lol
Micheal: Purugly is faster than Latias Also Micheal: How is this faster than me?😂
According to The Holy Michael, the hat is holy and whoever wears it shall recieve power and knowledge.
Ah yes tiny starly's going RRRRRRRRRRRRRR and hitting opponents like wack very nice.
Michel with a bread it just seems weird not a bad weird just different but then again he is older and all but it’s just ehh    Oh also I feel like the Ralph meme IM IN DANGER
Lets go Mikey u chose the best starter
Smallant1 has completed the pokedex already btw, so it was possible to get drifblim and drifbloon on release day
hes has a beard now lol didnt know
Shave your beard
You should make howler’s name into lil moke
I can't believe he grew his beard out!
my name is rowan and when he says professer rowan i thought he was reffering to me
anyone else have themselves a little chuckle at the galactic grunt that calls himself the "gruntiest grunt"
PaChiRiSu1
I feel it weird that grunty boy had beard While being called grunty boy
The starly in your first battle have 2 good ivs think
I don’t like the beard
Bro mikey you missed mew and jerachi the old couples gives you them
Can't deny that music is outstanding!
Yo get shavin
Can we talk about this sexy beard he has….mmmm
Mikey ignoring Grunty Boy has to be the funniest Grunty Bit he's done XD
le he: why he is faster than me  le me: bro that is faster than fricking 2 legendary based on aircraft
Bowl cut bros
GODLY MONKEY
13:28 deal
Mikey's a wimp who cares about type diversity.
I only associate the rival as stoopid.
I have diamond on the DS and Chimchar as my starter and is a female. Interesting how here it's a male. Love the series anyway
i found a togepi underground but it has hustle
Mikey I think u have forgotten that u can get a mew or jirachi from theat lovely old couple in Floaroma Town.
Them mythicals
Mars looks like a who but a cool way *puts sunglasses on. Mars put sunglasses on then we dance to galatic music.
Beard?
whoah! you have a beard that's not really a beard?! also your big fan is back! I chose Turtwig and called him twig :) I have a shinx named Lux a budew named valentina! (I'm italian I can call her valentina it suits her quite magically) and a buneary called Cotton lola (1. i couldn't diecde the names >:( 2. she's kinda like a ripoff of my alatria who also has 2 names :)
Micheal: oh I got the manaphi egg I’ll hatch it but not use it. Me who uses the manaphi all the time: ok.
I like how Grunty boy just breaks the fourth wall because Mikey is distracted
Hi mandjtv plays if you go floaroma town you talk to a old man & old lady you get mew & a Hitachi if you have a save file for sword & shield & let's go Pikachu & Eevee
If you talk to the old couple  then they’ll give you a mew and Jerache
Bru I just noticed his beard I feel dumb
So excited for this game. I chose chimchar but it had a relaxed nature. Nearly lost to a level 5 starly, reset the game and got a docile chimchar instead
the old couple give you mew and jirachi just so you know
I'm on the 7th badge already
2:24 bw2 male protag and customizations
Your beard is so cool, mikey
Mikey with a beard is bikey
First wild in counter in Eterna Forest was a Budew and a Shiny Buneary! My first random wild shiny in a mainline Pokémon game ever. I named it Hero.
MandJTV says *first playthrough of poke-* bro, shave your face!
12:30
Shave
You need to shave
Mikey: No one is gonna be able to get a driftloon for a week  Small Ant: 💪🙂 Built Different
Pokemon doo doo dimond.
MandJTV: Where's my hat!?  I love how he's so focused on that one thing missing in the game at the start.
Just curious, can you use Pokémon home in this game, and if so then it is totally possible to get drifloon before Friday
Ludichrist-mas
Its funny u just talked bout a random shiny i just bought it today and after 1 hour and a half found a random starliu shiny xD never was that lucky xD
Beard Boi
My name is Rowan (•‿•)◉‿◉
I love how Mikey finally just ignores Grunty boy
Mikey wants a hat because he’s bald™
What's that on your face
WOOOOOOOOO  breaking tms suck tho
"Now I can wait six hours for a Wurmple"  so true...
If you ever give away dialga I will be there… I one hit it and forgot to reset my save and saved before the elite four. So now I can’t get it unless I trade it
@13:30 you got me, I'll subsribe.
you need to battle all the trainers in eterna forest to get the soothe bell
Team galactic just became K-Pop stans
Can we just appreciate mars and her condom skirt
HE HAS A BEARDDDD???
When he said "Pachirisu" I could have sworn he said "Mah chili soup". I was kind of watching this in between battles while playing Shining Pearl myself.
Also you should look up gligar man, a super hero in the anime
I thought the same thing about Mars when I first battled her. Looks so funny in chibi style 🤣
No NO the beard it scares me
2 days i was here hi mikey u Might need a shave
Isint gliscor a physical attacker?
Your one of my favorite youtuber
Mikey: *Names Gligar Darkwing*  Mikey: *Names the other Gligar Stealth because batman vibes*   Me: *Narrows eyes suspiciously*
Speaking of Shinies in this video I found a shiny Random bidoof on my second encounter of my entire game but i didn’t have any poke balls yet becoming my fist ever failed shiny!😭
Dang looking good with that facial hair, really suits you!
He Ignored Raid Shadow Legends ad again, this is a great way to make less people skip ads
mikey with a beard is gonna haunt my nightmares XD
Love love the beard!
Horrible voice
Love your youtube videos and my brother Said once That your the best
All 🔥 types RULE!
Grunty Boi had become too powerful, he is now aware of the 4th wall.
I feel your pain about the Gligar but with Togepi. I spent upwards of an hour trying to get one with Serene Grace and not an awful nature 😂
I guessed that sponsor and got it right!
From the couple in the flowers you get mythical Pokémon
Not trying to be rude but GET RID OF THE BEARD PLSSS IT SCARES ME
Man this just makes me want the game even more!!!!
I wouldn't call it unrealistic. I was playing through my pokemon y game adventure for fun, and I ran into a shiny Bouldore in reflection cave. And of course I had to catch it.
The old couple in the aroma town gives you a mew and a jirachi if you have played pokemon sword and shield and  let's go Eevee or Pikachu
Cool beard
'noone will be able to get driftloon for a week' Laughs in Smallant
Am I the only that thought the moss covered rock was shrek
So lucky I saw it at GameStop. I could not get it tho
He is no longer Grunty Boi, He is GRUNTY MAN.
I have to say that I want these kind of graphics for the next generation. Sword and Shield were cool, but I like this chibi style and the battle fields.
You look like bools
I DARE U TO SUBSCRIBE TO MIKEY
Shave please
I see that Michael and howler have acquired chakra control in lockdown to be able to walk on water while fighting the magikarp 🧐🧐
You look like u haven't slept in 4 weeks take a break man
0:38 the music, nostalgia....
His First Pokémon Encounter: Bidoof My First Pokémon Encounter SHINY SHINX OH MAH GAWD
why didn’t you talk to the old couple in floaroma town😂 you get an amazong gift😂
Your Gligar struggle reminds me of my struggle to get a serene grace Togepi and then after 5 hustle in a row getting an adamant one instead of modest/bold
How new are those hideaways in the underground? I don't think they're in the original, at least I hope they weren't, but I haven't played much past gen 5 so I have no idea when they were introduced.
Grunty boy has a Raid shadow legends hyperfixation
Brilliant  diamond  is my first trip through the region. Guide me well team leader
So who wants to tell him about the item to evolve Gligar being post game...
u look 10 years older with the beard, nice beard btw
14:31 you should because mine didn't evolve until after veil stone gym
My first starly I encountered was a shiny! I freaked out finding such a cool full odds shiny
not me thinking I'm all original naming my infernape howler and then mikey names his the same thing
The Abras are so broken in this game! 😂 Long time fan on my private account!  Check out our Pearl vid Michael!! 😍
You sadly can’t get the razor fang to evolve gligar into gliscor until post game 😔😔
I can't wait to see Mikey find out he cannot use a Glisgor for this playthrough
The old couple in floaroma town give you a jirachi and mew
You can't see me. That John Cena moments..Lol
Is there anyone who wants to trade with me? I want to use a Steelix on my team. It would be much appreciated ☺️
I actually found a random shiny
Not sure but I think you can only get gliscor post game
USE LUXRAY
Grunty boi stop intrupting me!!!!!
mikey with a beard just doesnt feel right...
The old couple give a mew for let’s go and a jirachi for SwSh
am i the only one who doesnt care about natures?
Did anyone else notice that all the chibis are voldemort
Talk to the couple in aroma city trust me
Mikey, I'm sorry, but while Gligar is available, Gliscor will not be able to be obtained until post game. The Razor Fang isn't available until then. 😥
When did Mandjtv get a beard
It’s horrible you can’t get gliscor till post game what we’re they thinking
Budew evolves  with max happiness, you just did not love it enough
Ur next nuzlocke will be with a piplup😐😐😐😐😐 it's really not as bad as u think, so u should at least do it ONCE. In the new diamond and pearl  Also, I played with a manphy in a playthrough: it's a water Pokemon GOD. It is crazy useful  Also also: [caught a bedew on the first  routes = evolved just b4 Hearthome city] >:3 it's super easy, u guys
whens episode 2?
did you get mew and jirachi from the old couple in floaroma town?
This was one of the best grunty boi moments ever
I think I’d be tired if I had a rambunctious child like Barry
MandJTV: "it's a bra!"  me: **spits coffee**
Micky started groewing a beard!!!
My man needs a shave i feel itemedade me
I off rip nuzlocked the game it’s going good so far
Shave
Mandjtv I am just saying maybe you did not know but that old couple that u passed by will give you a mew and jirachi I know you won’t use it anyways but you should grab it for the pokedex
Speaking of Gliscor, when is the earliest we can obtain the Toxic orb in the game?
finalllyyyyyyyy
U did not get the mew and jirachi Go talk to the old couple at floaroma town
This is just Pokemon Diamond but with cheap RTX
Anyone feel like telling him about gliscor?
Mikey try and talk to the old couple in the flower garden and get two mythical Pokemon
Play shinin pearl
Hey mandjtv YOU NEED to check out The Pokédex entries if you can PLEASE! I saw a very shocking one from Gengar the other day and I would LOVE FOR YOU TO DO THAT VIDEO IN THE FUTURE!
Use garchomp
Why does Rowan's suitcase look cute...HOW DOES IT LOOK CUTE.
#PiplupSinnohChoice #GrookeyGang
Hilariously ironic since before i watched i got brilliant diamond, named my rival barry, and nearly picked chimchar before picking turtwig! XD
So… who’s gonna tell him that the razor claw is a post game item
THE BEARD
HE DIDN'T TALK TO THE OLD COUPLE
what is with that beard
We love you Mikey

Him saying it’s a bra
4.04 :it's a braaaaa
beautiful beard Mikey
I got my game on Friday and have been playing the whole weekend between work and I'm already at 4 badges and my piplup is now an Empoleon. I also managed to run into a shiney ponyta withing the first 5 hours of game play. I can't wait to get through the rest of the game. I need someone to trade with me though so I can evolve my haunter!
HE GOT A BEARD
So I just dug up a girafarig a few seconds before you did lol scary
Damn that beard is nice i only noticed it now
I hate to say it but you can only get Gliscor Postgame.
He skipped the old couple with mew and jarachi!
I made it past the elite four easily and beat Cynthia’s first five Pokémon easily. Then her garchomp came in, used one sword dance, and one shorted my whole team. My highest level Pokémon was level 60 infernape and her garchomp is level 66
i will use a new team *uses infernape, staraptor, luxray and the old ones again*
Mikey asking for a random Shiny  Me sitting over here with a Random Shiny Budew without even thinking about it
Is anybody gonna tell mikey about the mew and jirachi he can get by talking to old people in flower town
It took me over 2 hours to get a Togepi with Serene Grace. I got two beforehand, both with Hustle, before spending ages trying to finf one with Serene Grace.
I got random shiny bronzor!
About drifloon, you can set your time to 11/26 and still get the encounter. It starts the friday AFTER you defeat team galactic
9:52 BOMBUT!!!
I felt foreboding when Grunty Boi said "I need to tell someone about raid show legends..." Oh no, no no, nooo "So i'll tell you"  Ah! ... I have nowhere to go. I must watch the ad out of respect for grunty boi.
MICHAEL IM TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW THE RAZOR FANG ISNT AVAILABLE UNTIL POSTGAME
You are very well with your sponsor part of the video. Since it also has gameplay of the game I found myself  watching the whole thing and enjoying it. I have seen Raid Shadow Legends sponsors a ton and feel lie downloading the game using your link to support you :) Thank you for the amazing content to! Godbless
Sorry to disappoint but you can only get Gliscor in post game because you cannot get the razor fang until you beat the league..
“Its a Bra!!!!” Made me laugh like crazy😂, love the vid keep this series up
Just so u know Mikey, u cant get a razor fang to evolve ur Gligar until the post game
Ur beard
I wanna use Roserade but u don't  like the other starters so turtwig would overlap
Mikey is here
9:55 this looks like a funco pop
you have berd
please saze
Every time I play a Sinnoh game, I ALWAYS name my rival Thud so that when he bumps into me he yells out his name; "*THUD*"
SINCE WHEN DID MIKEY GET A BEARD
i love how he says the water looks so wet 3:05
Talk too the old couple trust me
You know you could get a Charmander in the fire cave but if it doesn't come up then get out of it and go back in and repeat until you find one
You can get a mew and jirichia from the old people in the flower place
Why didn’t you catch a starly
Wow you look diffrent today.
there is no censorship for the rival at the beginning. So say hello to Assface
I wish the full playthrough was shown instead of just a highlights reel.
Jesus shave
dat beard doe
Touch. That. Bidoof.
yo mickey shave the beared it doesn't look good
RAID SHADOW LEGENDS
Y mike has a beard?
I waited until I actually started goin through the game to watch the video (I was shiny hunting for my chimchar and got it after almost 11 hours) and our reaction to Barry calling us a kid and the name of our Shinxs were exactly the same.
floatzel when he uses hydropump its very funny
I feel bad for him because the razor fang is obtain in the post game
you missed mew and jirachi which you get from the old couple in Floaroma town
Reccomendation for a team member: Finneon. It looks awesome during night
Very good adspot
Mickey with a beard. NANI?!?!
Idk why but I'm the player who plans their team and only catches members if their team
somebody please tell Mikey that he can't use a Gliscor during the main playthrough because the razor fang is a post game item
Where can we watch the uncut version?
I have played platinum and I've got stuck in heart home city for so long trying to defeat fantina that my monferno evolved/that my monferno evolved trying to defeat fantina                 fun fact: my monferno was at lvl 35 because of how it took me to defeat fantina
you should talk to the old couple left of  the wind mill because you could get a jirachi and a mew
pls do part2
1:08 is it just me or is that starly shiny
Poor grunty boy 🤣
Take the mustache of
Also I still have the dislike button lol Edit:not gonna use it on you tho lol
Yay he refrnced the pa hiring world champion I saw that fact and never forgot it and that's why pachirisu is so memorable to me and somebody in the anime had one
BOI I ALREADY AM DOIN THE LAKE QUEST
Which is better, rash or bashful nature?
what 12:03 just what
hey Mikey just got my copy yesterday
Me and Mikey are litteraly the same we both chose diamond,we both chose chimchar,we both chose the same avatar,both thought that Barry's mom looked dead inside that was a funny coinsidence. Edit:we both knew we had to evolve chimchars for gym 1
Should have named the Chimchar,   Ludacris
BIDOOF IS A POKEMON GOD!!!!!!!!
How are you getting the gliscor? Ive been Reading that the razoes claw is post game only :(
Before I watched this video I named my budew hemlock lol
PLZ bring episodes daily i  mean every days. ok we dont need facecam now pretty plz
I literally still own my copy of Pokemon Diamond.
nice beard!
Gliscor is post game
Haven’t been here in a year you have a beard!!!
i laugh at omg its a bra
WHAT THE-  HE HAS A BEARD!!!
I remember I watched a video on brilliant diamond that there is a chance that you can find other pokemon starters in the caves
Grunty boi, go and talk about this to John or Jack then
I wonder how he's going to take it that the Razor Fang is a post game item...
Did you know Purugly is actually faster than Latios?
The TM's break, but it is easy to get more.
Can't wait for my games to come in a play my play through of diamond just did a POC on Pearl so stoked to start one
Have you found the Mew and Jirachi?
Shouldve named Chimchar Monke
12:44 did anyone see anything? I didn't.
Why does grunty boi get his hair as mikey does
"why are you faster than me" Purugly being faster than Latios and Latias
Remember to talk to that old couple at Floraroma Town to get your Mew and Jirachi
Gligar evolves at the end of the game
If you want the evolution of Gligar you can't get it until postgame so I'm sorry
God your throat must hurt from playing Gruntie Boi
Omg Grunty boi WITH A REAL BEARD, AHHHHHHHHH!!!!
YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE, MICHEAL, WHY?????
I love the beard
Micheal should’ve named Barry Poop as a reference to his platinum play through
1:46 absolute king kong balls
bruh shave ur ber
On the topic of Brillaint Diamond, and random shinies.  The very first patch of grass I entered after Twin Leaf town, was a full odds, random shiny Starly.  Do yall understand how insulting it is to encounter a shiny Pokemon BEFORE you even have a chance to get Pokeballs?
I already watched on other channels but came here for grungy boy
No way he actually went past the npc that gives you mew and jirachi
He looks like a family friendly jacsepticy
Oh look an old couple They give jirachi and mew
Me: *Comes back to this channel* Also Me: "OH GOD HE HAS A BEARD NOW 0-0"
Hey mikey do you know you can get mew and jirachi from floaroma town if you talk to the couple in the flower they will give you mew and jirachi
The pain I felt when he did not get the mew and jirachi
Talk to the old couple :3
Hey Michael I am one of your fans I like how you play Pokemon my favorite Pokemon is Greninja and it was my starter I say this is my biggest accomplishment I defeated Pokemon X in 2 days my greninja's nature is Hardy and his characteristic is quick-tempered
ManJTV has grew a beard
My experience with the BDSP community has been weird. On one hand you have really chill people who are fun to talk to, and on the other hand you have 5 year olds screaming GIVE ME GIBLE NOW
The mustache
How are you planning to evolve the gligar. Because the razor fang is a post game item and you also can’t get one in sword and shield or lets go
GO shave
The character's look like Mii's and the battlefield is really cool.
I miss his kinda chill and mostly unedited playthroughs. now it just feel like he's trying to keep our attention
The pain of seeing Michael ignore the old couple with the legendaries 😅
Hey Mikey I know you worked hard on this video and you need to safe time and cut out the boring stuff but could you give us a raw walk through like let's go and sword. Plz like so Mikey can see.
I just realized Sinnoh here is just Hokkaido but lines
Pain Peko of knowing how to play Pokémon and still having to go through the tutorial
Lol you got a beard
you can get mew and jirachi btw :)
this editing style reminds me so much of PurpleCliffe! like how upbeat it is :)
You should have talked to the old couple you mentioned in Floaroma Town, they would have given you Jirachi and Mew! (Jirachi for a Pokémon ShSw save file, Mew for a Let‘s Go save file)!
Those 2 old couples that you past in floworama town will give you jirachi and mew for playing Pokémon let’s go pikachu and eevee and sword and shield.
Michal needs to shave like literally
3000 years after diamond ... me:finally sinnoh remakes that i don`t know how to progress cause i never played diamond
Wonder what mikeys reaction will be when he finds out you cant get Gliscor til postgame
I love your videos! I watch a few different Pokétubers but you always bring such a great sense of humor and joy to Pokémon content. It's wonderfully refreshing!
Mikey Needs to Shave
old rod more like magiccarp rod
You get Mew and Jirachi from the cute couple
“It’s A BRA”                             -Mikey
Route 210 is way to good
I beat shining pearl. My team was empoleon, togekiss, gengar, houndoom, gallade, and rhydon. I swept Cynthia using only togekiss. So togekiss is mvp.
Your beard looks very good on you 😉
Holy crap that music goes HARD. I might buy the game just for the music lol
The facial hair is magical
Bro you are the most entertaining youtuber i know, your content never fails to keep me attached thank you for this experience.❤
So who is gonna be tge one to break it to Mike that you can't get a razor claw until victory road or post game???
Nice beard 😀👌
SPEAK TO ZE OLD MAN IN ZE FLOOWER FIELDS, i did and freaked out when ⟟ got the thing
Why does he have a beard? BRUH!
SHAVE NOW MIKEY
Yessss I’m playing it while everyone else plays it it’s the one time of year when I’m happy   Also the old couple he mentioned in the flower town give you mew if you have played let’s go
He just casually skips the gift Mew and Jirachi
The first roselia I ran into was shiny sooooooo
Gonna be so angry when he finds out he can’t evolve it until the post game, we are in the same boat, we best get use to gligar
You know when he said "you can't play pokemon without a hat!" Well I am wearing a Pikachu Hoodie in bdsp and it doesn't have a hat in the clothing set so......
...nobody tell him gliscor is only available at nearly the end of the game
Did he purposefully skip the free Mew and Jirachi!!!!!
Talk to the old couple!!!
Thank Ilca
Grunty Boi breaking the fourth wall uwu
I don't think you can get Gliscor pre E4 so you'll just have a Gligar
“Man, did I get that lucky to get that unlucky” 😂😭😂
Jesus since when did he have a beard mikey no not a good look shave it off
Can’t get it yet because I lost my switch somewhere, but this just makes me really want to play!!!
That couple give you mew and another pokemon
I don’t like the Beard cuz it’s to similar to my uncles
When team galactic challenges you to a battle before the battle they place down their g mat
I love the beard
Yeah...I'm still hunting for a Ralts with a decent nature for my Gallade
The bug catcher doesn’t look like Pokémon at all
God Barry’s face is so punchable
Talk to the cute old couple. Thank me later.
Ur beard is …… cool?
You can get mew and jirachi from the old couple you passed in the city
Nice beard
U cant get gliscor till post game for some reason
You can re battle gyms in postgame
after u beat the game do shiny only nuzlocke
I wonder if Mikey ever realized Grunty Boi came over that day? 🤔
Bidoof
AHHHHHH MIKEY HAS A BEARD
Too bad Gliscor is post game razor fang is only available in the battle park literally just found out after grinding it up
I was in physical pain when he didn’t even get the Mew and Jirachi from the old couple. He doesn’t need to use it, I just want him to collect them.
This is so stupid I didn't catch drifloon and got all the math problems correct in the gym so now I have to wait until Friday to see a dam drifloon incredibly annoying
i picked Piplup but i understand your choice of Chimchar.
I appreciate the howler monkey reference
The couple gives you mew and jirachi
Michael looks so old with the beard... XD
Ayo grunty boi out here breaking the fourth wall.
It's nice to see that you too are really excited about the new games Mikey!
Take to the couple in the flower field they will give you a Jirachi and a mew
The reason you are forced to go home is to get the hat
Can someone explain why EVERY 3D Pokemon game is required is have this washed out color scheme? Why does Gamefreak like that so much? I see so many Nintendo games with vibrant colors...heck, the 2D Pokemon games had more vibrant color.
Talk to the old couple they give you mew and jirachi
Omg It’s happening he is playing it
That old couple gives you Mew and Jirachi for free. You need SW/SH save data on your Switch for Jirachi and Let's Go for Mew. I was contemplating getting these games for Mew (one of the few Pokemon I have never owned but wanted) but I do not have the Let's Go games so that kills it for me.
Hey mikey if you go back to the couple in floaroma town the man gives you a jirachi if you played sword/sheilf and the woman gives you a mew if you played pikachu/eevee
I’m sorry but Gliscor is a post game Pokémon because you can’t find razor fangs till post game
Hey sad news gligar can only evolve with a razor claw and you only get one post game I know it’s sad I wanted to use one as well 😭😭
MIKEY WITH A BEARD AAAAAAAAAAAAA
Those to trainers in the grass give you a jirachi and a mew gift
Michael got a beard now
this is literaly pokemon plat 3D
I have spent hours in the underground mining then I found out the old dude teaches you everything through challenges. I still haven’t looked at all the caves but it’s my current fave place to waste time and train my Pokémon. I kept running into level 27 - 29 with only level 22 pokemon
Nice Beard
That starkly looked shiny
I’m too bored to play the game myself so YAY FREE GAMEPLAAAAAY
Sorry to say, you can’t get razor fang until post game in BDSP, bit too faithful there
TALK TO THE OLD PEOPLE IN flaroma town they give you mew
The old couple give you mythical Pokémon, only know because I talk to everyone. I’m watching you while walking my 6 yr old through the same parts of the game
You skipped a free mythical if you talk to the older couple in the flower patch lol
talk to the old couple in the flower field  they give you mew and Jirachi if you pokemon let's go and pokemon sword and shield(its broken)
Did you know that when you get a random encounter, if the camera points over to you before showing the wild Pokémon, it means that the Pokémon you’re getting has it’s hidden ability
my man needs to shave Ö
Spoiler by the way they use flints diamond and pearl team
Ah good choice brilliant diamond 💎 is the best
He missed the mew and jirachi
i'm looking foward to seeing drapion
old couple in floaroma town give you jirachi and Mew
The spawns are basic because You have not setup any statues
Isnt gliscor postgame
``you should pick up the jrachi and mew in floroma town by the couple out
Talk to the old couple in floarama town to get mew and jirachi, if you have Pikachu/evee and sword/shield save data respectively For your underground base, go and talk to the underground man, complete a few simple sidequests, get a digger drill and make a base Interact with the orb to place a statue
Me no like beard/mustache ps. I still love your channel.
Please when it comes out please play Pokemon legend of Arcus please
Mikey has an enormous beard
I like the video but I wanted a full episodes of streaming the game instead of edited one.. love your content <3
Wait until he figures out that the razor fang can only be gotten in Post-Game I'm pretty sure.
I love how he just ignored the old couple that gives you Mew & Jirachi*
empolion
Apparently Brilliant Diamond doesn't like giving you good natures for Pokemon. I got 6 Zubats in a row who had a nature that was -Atk or -Spd. Then again, when I finally got one that did work, I got an Adamant Zubat, which is pretty good. So my luck has been really good or really bad. lol
wonder if dusk balls would work in the underground ?
Talk to the old people in the flowers to get mew and jirachi!
I wanted Mikey to name him poop 😂😂😂
0:08 That’s the japanese guy lmao if you wanted to be white you would have chosen the blond character
Pov: you don't skip Mikey's promotions for grunty boi
mikey: i know its unrealistic but i just want a random encounter shiny me, who found a shiny buneary before my second badge:
Hisuian Mikey
Wow Grunty boi has coincidentally also grown facial hair Hmmmmm
Michael:Oh look a cute couple. Me:AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
i got this when it came out and me and my brother already have 4 hours in it. and i got a shiny statue already as my first statue which i thought was hilarious
Why do you have a beard
Which version can I catch mime Jr I really want to use one for my team
The old couple gives you Mew and Jarachi
Him not at least claiming the Mew and jirachi is bothering me lol
YOU GOT A MUSTACH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
you can get mew and jirachi by playing sword and sheild
11:49 “Oh, look. An old couple. How cute.”  Me: “A couple who holds untold power in each of their hands.”
Get the Jirach and Mew
Yo he got a beard
So weird seeing you with a beard. Not that it's a bad thing it's just unusual.
I am mad that he didn't go for the miticals in flowroma (idk how its spelled)
Shave the beard mate
Talk to the couple in the flower something (I don't know the name of that place ;-;)  there is a surprise there
It is a disgrace he did not it Ludacris
Thanks for choosing the better version
the couple in floroama  gives you mew and jirachi
I’m sorry but is no one gonna mention the BEARD?!
I named my Shinx X-Ray too!!
21:30– “Deathstalker”? I didn’t know you watched RWBY.
Question do you think that brilliant diamond or shining pearl is better
Bro is there new starters of diamond?
The pain I felt when he found Gligar and remembered why I can't use mine. Razor Fang is post only 😭😭😭
Michael & Howler became Naruto fighting the wild Magikarp
As someone who using. Roserade It does take incredibly long to a evolve It didn’t evolve. Until Level 30
damn this had no dislikes, incredible
Do team sky when your don with your playthrou and see if gurunty boy wants to play plzplzplzplzplzplzplzplzplzplz
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.WHO IS THIS BEARDED KIDNAPPER
To turn Gligar into Gliscor you need the Razor Fang. Unfortunately, in Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, this is now a post-game item.  Sad times
I got the gsme yesterday then I lost my switch so now I have the game but no sitch
Go back to flouraroma town and talk to the old ladies
Mikey you got lucky finding that ralts I have been trying to get a ralts for the past 3 hour and when I find a female (the gender I want) and it’s level 19 or 20 (the level I want) it teleports away.
Grunty boy is now Grunty MAN
I asked for the game for Christmas can’t wait
Even though I always skip Raid Shadow Legends ads or sponsors, I can't help but watch them when Grunty Boy talks about them. Haha. Who else watched it?
This play through gonna be good!
Dat beard doe
talk to the old couple for special pokemon in floaroma town
Who this?
Get the mew frome the old lady
I'm afriad I have terrible gligar news, from what I can tell the razor fang is only optainable in the post game. As someone with a Gligar as a team member in my game I have searched far and wide on the internet. There is a possibility that you can found one as a pickupable item in the grand underground. As I found similar items like a deep sea tooth that haven't been listed online yet. But it ain't looking good mate.
14:14 you can get roselia early in the grand underground
I cannot buy it but please enjoy it for me
You should do bdsp but I’m team sky
that beard is ✨crisp✨
I’ve never played these games so I will have fun this Christmas I guess playing for the first time
You should talk to the old couple in floroma town, there's a reason
Please make part two
go to floraaroma town and talk to the old couple and they will give you mew and jurachi
I was expecting the return of ludachris, or his son but ok.
That “old couple” in floroama town give you mew and jirachi if you have (I think) sw/sh and let’s go data on the account that you’re using
Michael you need to talk to the old couple in Floarama town to get Jirachi and Mew
Man ur beard growing like heck lol, 😂 i am obsessed with ur clean shave
If you talk to the old couple in the flower Town you get a free mew and a free jirachi
The old couple in flower town give you a mew and Jirachi
You hava a beard
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but Flint of the elite four uses his diamond and pearl team
It’s team bull crap
O ko looooool
Hey Mikey! You should go back and talk to the old couple on the flower city 👀
Sorry bruh, you can't get gliscor before the league
Don’t you get razor fang post game so he can’t get gliscor until he beats the league
I found a random shiny bidoof on route 201
Anyone know where to find a trainer with Prinplup?? Trying to complete sinnoh dex & haven’t seen One.
Bald Mikey
I'm sorry but i wanted gliscor to only to find out you can't evolve a gligar until post game
Since when did he grow a beard?
https://youtu.be/I4f60bQ1s6E
4:45
I love his  beard more than I thought.
CHIMCHAR SQUAD
Mikey what happene that beasrd
Doctor: micheal with a beard doesn’t exist, it can’t hurt you Micheal with a beard:
Mikey with beard is unusually kinky
congrats on no.48 trending
if you talk to the couple in the flowers in the hometown they give u a mew (lets go save file) and a jirachi (sw/sh save file)
I like Pokémon Diamond but it sucks because my name is Barry so I can’t name my rival barry
I have Infernape, Bibarrel, Abomasnow, Luxray, Garchomp or Lucario, and Drifblim for my Diamond team where I'm at Victory Road. I even bought some Dialga and Palkia Capri-Sun at the grocery store yesterday.
Little did he know he walked past a free mew and jirachi
You can get mew and jirachi by talking to that old couple in flairoma
Funny story I was just talking about how I wanted to see what shiny buizel looks like and find a RANDOM shiny buizel
I subscribe to your channel and I love how they look so tiny and when you bottle they are so big.
I haven’t seen u in a while u even grew a bear
Do it now
Talk to the old couple
I’m sorry to say that you can’t get Gliscor :<  You can only get the Razor Fang post-game
you wouldn't have 1hkoed onyx anyway since it has sturdy
The old couple gives you jirahchi and mew
Wait a minute when did he get a beard
I lile how he forgot about the sponsor so he made ut like he didnt talk back😅
good thing no nuzlock huh?
1:34 YES
The presentation alone is better than Sword and Shield already. Say what you will about the chibi style, but the UI and battle screens are so much better looking than any other switch Pokémon game.   Absolutely loving this game so far.
If you watch Jaden animations Pokémon Ranger While playing the game it says: -Touch the bidoof Mand is like: -you are now mine bidoof Mand in the final battle: -OK bidoof you are useless get in the box
Someone found a shiny starly but no pokeball
Man he has a beard now?
I'm glad someone is using ChimChar besides me lol
Mikey is BALD that why he wants a hat
It's weird that Mike has a beard
Michael you can’t get a Glidcor until you beat the league! Big sad
Sir. Your beard
The “cute old couple” gave you Mew and Jirachi
I haven’t watched you in a while but god DAMN you rockin that facial hair and it looks great
Poketuber man get the Mew and Jirachi
We're not going to tell him that you can't evolve gligar in the main game
That beard tho
BEARD BEARD
Should use ralts when encountering gligar cause it can sychronize
I’m waiting to play these games till I number 1  Complete my sword Pokédex (I only have 20 left) and number 2 finish heartgold (I’m at the elite 4 now)
Imagine not getting an Adamant Gligar your first encounter
i just realized grunty boy just copies mickey like the beard
Jesus Monkey
Mikey SHAVE YOUR BEARD
Gonna be sad when he finds out you can’t get Gliscor until post game…
I looked away from the screen for a minute and he said he found Abra but  thought he said I found A BRA
12:43 it would be more funny if he added "sausage nippels" in there 😂😂
only 150
first go to water cave fire or grass you will find the starters when you complete the dex
WOOO
Hey mikey or katie plese don't edit this video like a challenge playthrough I want to see like uncut version since I  can't buy the game for myself
It looks weird that when not battling. The head is so Big meanwhile the body is small its just-
wurmple ez find in grand underground if u want one
Why beard?
I found a random shiny Zubat, I love Crobat and wanted one during my play through but alas it had an attack lowering nature :(
gligar only evolves postgame i think someone correctme if im rrong i want one

you have the same pokemon starter but he envolve I  nickname him fire breath
TALK TO THE OLD COUPLE THEY GIVE YOU LEGENDARYS
You probably already know this but you can get a Jirachi and a Mew talking to the couple in Floroma Town
Man this just makes me want the game even more
Did you ever realize that when you are running around everyone is short and fat but when in a battle they are normal
Mickeys beard
The old couple gives you mew if you have played Pokémon let’s go
Damn Mikey got a beard in nine days
11:48 Idk if you already know this and you decided to skip them, but just in case, that elder couple give you Mew and Jirachi if you have save data of Let's Go and SW/SH
He didn't talk to the old couple to get mew and jirachi
Why is no one mentioning Mikey's beard
Hey Mike, if you've played Let's Go Eevee, you get a free Mew, and if you've played Sword/Shield, you get a free Jirachi. Talk to that old couple in Floaroma.
I call him professor boat because he is Rowan (buh duh buh)
How wrong I spell all the characters name video should be done sometime 😅😅
Mikey looks weird with a beard
Trying to soft reset for a shiny Turtwig. Well over 300 soft resets
Dude I love your content, but please don’t take away my ability to skip grunty boy 😭
just to let you know i got a budew and even though i did nothing apart from use it for battles it evolved somehow
1:07 The first battle. The little Starly is there, AND I MUST CRUSH ITS BONE!! 1:22 Our lives were in danger from tiny birds who were only going HURRRRRRR!!! 3:05 The water looks so wet. 11:49 Oh look an old couple how cute. 11:55 Can I get your Papa ? I will crush those who have captured your Papa. 12:42 You cant see me. JOHN CENA!! 14:35 Hey girl! 17:25 Am I really gonna go through every single one of these hideaways on this one trip ? Absolutely I am.
Liked for that Draphion's Dedication 👍👍
Anyone out there who can help trade me an eevee and a rotom so I can use them on my team plzzz
Professor row anne
when mikey said where do i get my hat, that was literally me yelling where’s my hat
How are you planning on getting your Gligar evolved before the postgame?
I'm going to say this. The married old couple gives you a Jirachi and Mew when you beat the 2nd gym.
Talk to the old couple in Floraroma Town! They each give you something!
Beard mikey  go brrrrr
Who’s gonna tell him you can’t get a gliscor until post game
You have to talk to the old couple, so they can give you a free mew and jirachi
Bro digging the Beard
Anyone else gonna mention the beard? Like it’s quickly consuming his face
I it just me or I'm sad in this video cause of furret walk

I like when mandjtv is ignoring grunty boi
Lol had the same reaction I had to receiving the hat.  Current team: Zoe the Monferno Nova the Luxio Emily the Budew Nixie the Buizel
Your moustache is so funny cut your moustache
I really hope he uses scizor on his team
Mandjtv made it to the trending page. Congrats dude you’ve come a long way.
Play sw and sh save files and you will get a jitachi play lets go and get a mew
Bro mike I love facial hair 😁
I got the game on Friday and I haven’t ever used a shinx before so I caught one and named it X-Ray and then you named yours X-Ray too!!! Also shinx com day is today for Pokémon Go
I am now starting a petition for Mikey to refer to Pachirisu as the he calls it in this video!!! All those in favor respond Arkoos!!!
Michael is  a man now
1:25
You have to shave your beard mikey
1:24
You should save your beard cuz ur looking weird    Ayooooo Good Rhyme
Is it me or did he not talk to the old couple in Floaroma town to get both Mew and Jirachi?
I remember playing pokemon pearl for the first time in 2014 when I was 6
I love how Michael just ignores grunty boi
MIKEY TALK TO THE OLD COUPLE IN THE FLOWER FIELD ONE GIVES YOU MEW THE OTHER GIVES YOU JIRACHI
3:05 LOL  "Water looks so wet" Mikey 2021
It made me go glad to see he freaked out when he got his hat too! I'm not the only one 😆
Hmmm the razor fang is post game wtf why?!?! I want gliscor on my bd team im angry
Why is that grunt.
Soo who is going to tell Mikey that you can’t evolve gligar until you get in the hall of fame??
Something feels weird  about Michaels beard but I like it
He didn't get the jirachi and mew?
Grunty boi :, speaking about the sponsor Michael: interrupt him Grunty boi:stop interrupting me Me: dying from laughing because grunty boi got a taste of his own medicine
I’m a simple man, I see grunty boi, I skip ahead 120 seconds
Please shave
U have a beard
The hell
wait what. wasnt it gonna release in early 2022?
Had anyone tell him the bad news about the game?
I got my shiny Dialga on my 40th encounter
I honestly think that fighting should resist water because  athlete build their muscles by swimming
Michael beard look ..... ok
RAID SHADOW LEGENDS IS BACK?!?!
YOUR BEARD🤚🤚😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Can’t wait to get it for Christmas
How would torterra + gliscor be no bueno?
Speak to the old couple if you have let's go and sword/shield save data you get some mythicals
Hey if you talk to that old couple in the town that has the all the flowers you get mew and jirachi
Me realizing that if he talked to the "old couple" he would get a gift mew or jirachi:  😅😅😅
Therapist: "Michael with beard and mustash isn't real. He can't hurt you."  Michael with beard and mustash:

You know Mandjtv is wholesome, when he said “An old couple, cute”
This editing is pretty cool but i prefer the less edited long cut playthroughs
ur beard wierd
WHEN DID HE GET A BEARD
Commander Mars looks THICC!
Me:Oooooo the old couple that’s gives you jirachi  Mikey: Passes by them Me: *internal screaming* GO BACK TO THE OLD COUPLE IN THE FLOWERS
I love ur content
Mikey I’m so sorry to tell you but you literally can only get the razor fang for gliscor in the post-game
Mikey you absolutely should use those Skorupi
Is a modest serene grace jirqchi good ??
SHAVE UR BEARD PLZ
Why did you grow a beard?
Tiny birds that go HRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Amoongus
How did you get a shiny Statue without trying!
Amoongus
Amoongus
Amoongus
Amoongus

Dunno if you know but the old couple in Floaroma town both have amazing gifts if you have a let’s go and sword or shield save file!! (U probs know, but if not surprise)
Blah blah blah
0:49
Rip mikey. I was gligar hunting for more than an hour and caught 5 all with -atk  until i found one that wasnt trash and later realized gliscor was locked behind postgame 🙃
When will grunty boi do another gameplay
you can walk with your pokemon
It's I don't know why but I call proffeser rowen , proffeser powen ( sorry for spelling prof wrong I am a 11 year old kid ) and don't you DARE TO INSULT THE GOD THE ONE AND ONLY BIDOOF
I found my first shiny in brill diamond (not shiny hunting) ...and it had to be a bidoof.......a bidoof....
Even in chibi form Prof Rowan is badass.
So no one is gonna talk bout bearded Mikey,ok
Dude he looks so different with a beard
Poor Grunty boi...
Hey you know that old couple you should talk to them
Grunty boi with a beard is so weirdly scary-
He looks  so different?!  😅
Chimchar + 5 Aipom with pick up ability. Free pokeballs, potions and rare candies
YAY GLISCOR FANSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I thought I should mention this, but the item to evolve Gligar is post game I believe
Love the beard!
When did you get a beard
You should talk to the old couple in Floaroma, you'll get two free mons if ya played lets go and SwSh
I like how he ignores grunty boi and grunty boi gets annoyed, while every time we see them arguing 😂
What about mew and Jirachi did he get it as the gift Pokemon in Floaroma Town
11:49 you could've gotten mew...
You missed the jirachi at the old couple in flouroma
MY GOD MICHALE HAS A BEARD
Michael you need to talk to the couple they will give you a Pokémon that's really strong
1:46 yall seeing what im seeing????
Tip: once you make it to the 6th gym go up to the sailor and go to iron island and go to the cave and head down the stairs look for a platform and head down you will see a guy in all blue talk to him you'll fight 2 double battles and 1 team galactic double battle once you do he gives you a rioulo egg!
I just wanna say Mikey looks like the ultimate Chad rn
Did u know that absorb is super duper effective on rock types like onix, it 1 hit or 2 on a rock type. If u want a pokemon with absorb, u can get budew but u need to grind it because it will get the absorb
Maybe you should have named this chin hat Ludachrist after all…especially walking on water
How dare Mikey ignore Grunty Boi
Poor Mikey he doesn't know u cannot get a razor fang until post game
I got shiny wurmpel in the forested
by the way i beat roark with a team entirelly weak to rock and i still had a chimchar but my geodude got enogh rollouts that i beat his pokemon
Mikey when I'm alone: Today we are playing Pokemon! Mikey when my pparents walk in: A bra! (3:59)
You're so happy about the hat.i felt like you saying victory is mine.
Holy sht the facial hair. Inky only stopped watching for 2 months
huh when mikey grows a beard grunty boi does too, how strange
Nice beard you’ve got mickey
I'm not joking when I say I got a shiny bidoof 15 minutes
If you talk to one of the old couple in floroma town you get a free jirachi
You can change your outfit in the menu.
Mikey: HAT Everyone: It starts when you get your sta- Mikey: *H A T*
3:59 wtf
Your gligor bad luck is you karma for not  choosing the piplup btw everyone I have  seen play the game chooses chimchar no piplup and especially not turtwig that why I’m mad
He forgot new and jirachi
You like Nico from ssundee among us
MIKEY WITH A BEARD ISN'T REAL HE CAN'T HURT YOU
Hey plese pin my comment
Shave your mustache and beard and stop swearing
probably not the first to say this, and probably not going to be the last one but, you look really good with a beard!
"This Water Looks So wet!"                    -Mikey
I miss your smooth face
Second pokemon I caught was a shiny starly.
You can get a platinum uniform and a manaphy egg if you use the mystery gift thing and I think you unlock it at the third gym badge
Mikey should at least be glad that grunty boi is helping him with the sponsors-    Grunty boi deserves another whole video for himself-
talk to the cute old couple
play coromon
I haven't seen mandjtv in a while and seeing that bush is surprising!
I have decided to not use just the same six pokemon. As i progress through the region, i catch as many pokemon as i can, switching them up depending on the upcoming gymleader and which ones i havent used yet. furthermore to make the game more difficult i tend to play according to hardcore nuzlocke rules, except the rules where if one pokemon faints its dead and the rule where you can only catch one pokemon per route are excluded. Also i cant use more pokemon than the gymleader is using.
mikey looks like a dad
I am very angry that your chimchar Is NOT NAMED LUDACRIS

You can get a mew if you talk to one of them
No one is going to get a driftloon in like a week. Smallant: Hold my wooper
13:19 because it's faster than latios and latias
Honestly all Pokètubers are only using Chimpy boi Edit: male poketubers* and also choosing the blue hair boy :v:
i pogged for at least a mi ute in the undergroud wild areas also, turbo controller for idle chain raising igf u were wantingh to multi task as long as u keep an eye onit
WHEN DID YOU GET A BEARD       it looks amazing☺️
Wait ... this means you can find pre national dex pokemon before getting it ... YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
2:22 Mike: You can't play a Pokemon Game without a Hat! Me: Well... Actually you can! Ahem! Character Customization! 😄
Like the beard my guy
The old couple give you mew
plot twist: that first shinx he encountered had guts
I am the only one who notice his bear wow he is getting old
unoriganal but  named barry crack hed  cuz head wouldnt work qnd because he's always yelling and asking for money ands some of the starter dialogues are priceless as usual
You missed mew you could have get it by those couples in flower garden
You look so cool with the beard Mikey!!!!!

TALK TO RHE OLD COUPLE
Watdahelwitdat stache
I had fun using Budew and Starly against Roark. And of course Turtwig too. but he was given to fare well.
Michael im sorry for being the bearer of bad news but the evolution item to get Gliscor is in post game location.
he looks weird with hair in the ball
yo i didnt realize you have a beard now!
Why didn’t you get mew and jirachi ???
Micheal with a beard is so weird is it just me?
Mandjtv please make a grunty boy plushie which holds a sign that spells sub to Mikey     Edit: you make awsome videos
Me getting sad because I am still hunting for a shiny starter, I have hunted for 20 hours
"An old couple, how cute." Missed it by that much.
looking nice with beard
Get a Pokémon synchronise in a serious nature and there is a 50% Chance the Pokémon that you're catching with that Pokémon would be serious
Hi
Sed. No Torterra :(
21:40 this is how I feel about Togepi, low spawn rate and either hustle or freaking adamant nature
I watch his videos after 2 years and he has a full grown beard this looks so unnatural
Mikey: A-bra! Me: *what*
When did Mikey get Captain America's beard?
TALK TO YHE OLD COUPLE
Togakiss
Dude that is a sweet beard
I saw this!
I like the beard
Ya know it's funny I've never actually had a problem beating mars' purugly
If Mikey goes back to the 'old couple' and talk to them they give you each mythical pokemon if you have played Let's go or Swish
Talk to the old couple
That beard tho
Mikey if you talk to the old man in Floroma town you can get a jirachi
is a bra
Mike : how are u faster than me....to purugly Me : It is literally faster than the legendary jet Pokemon Latios.. 🤣🤣
So people know if you talk the old man and lady you get both jirachi and mew if you have played Pokémon go, and sword and shield.
Bro shave pls
You should speak to the couple you saw in 11:49, they give you a Jirachi and a Mew
If You Talk To The Old Girl To Floroama You Get A Free Jirachi!
sinnoh was the first pokemon game i got, my mom was very against me playing video games that weren't "girl games". pokemon was on that list so when i saw pearl at a second hand store i bought it. the first pokemon i caught was a totally op shinx i named belle that let me breeze through the first part of the game, now if i can get a shinx i always named it belle for my first pokemon baby.
Mike has a beard
I love the Beard now!      Be well now!
eyyyy!!! mikey did a gameplay on this lets go!!
I like your beard Mikey 😂😂😂
4:10 Yes, They do. But you can obtain them multiple times now
16:46 I thought they added loot boxes for a sec lol
You can mew and Jura hi for free if u talk to these two people as long as u have a let’s go game and a galar game save data on ur switch
Ohh you need a shave🪒
Why not markus :( it my name
13:15 "How are you faster than me!?" I find this funny, because I just watched your video where you pointed out that Purugly is faster than Latios & Latias.
BEARD
I picked piplup grunty boy more like glatic boy
Just find a better gligar offscreen
Please go back to the old couple and talk to the old man..
He started with a shiny starly
I have learned from my play through that you can not evolve your gligar into gliscor until post game. I’m sorry Mikey, you chose the wrong starter for no reason 😔
12:04
It has probably been weiteren already. But the old Couplet you ran by in the flowertowm (dont know the Name) gibes you mew ans jirachy, because you are having let's Go and Sword/Shield.
Shame he missed talking to the old couple, he could have had a Mew and Jirachi before the second gym...
mandjtv go to flomora town and go to the old couple speak to the women and a mew for playing lets go speak to the man and get jirachi for playing pokemon sword and shield
Talk to the old couple in the flower field.
That moment when Mikey passes up the old couple that give you mew and jirachi
you can find starters find in the undergroud
Did you miss the mew?
From heart home city we can bring out our pokemon from balls
It is my favourite mon
Please use staraptor
bruh be nice to grungy boii hes a great character so stop the grunt boi abuse :(
mike are you gonna shave
Mikey: oh look, an old couple, how cute! Old couple: when is this jackass gonna take our legendaries?
Boo turtwig team
I was gone for legitimately 2 seconds what happened
i want shining pearl
1:25 best sound fx moment 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fun fact: the old couple in flourouroma town gives you a jirachi
These games are fun’ on to the 6th gym,this is also my first run using a manaphy,mew,and jirachi!
get mew
Get A Jirachi Plz
I'm so used to Pokémon sword that this game looks really bad
Michael keep Skorupi cause I think You Don't use it before
Hi!! There, Why you can get Mew and Jirachi?
This play through is gonna go great and also loving the beard😂
Who's gonna tell him razor fang to evolve gligar is post game and eviolite doesn't exist?
Cool vid keep it up
I thought u,played shining pearl one time and said it was hard
I love chimchar
my parter is named loser
I called my zobat ZoBatman
Ro-ahn
Talk to the "cute olg couple" you will get Jirachi and mew
3:58 it's a-bra!
Grunty boi talking to us is cursed
Talk to the couple in floraroma both of the pls
you grew a big beard
Shave
Mikey shave
No because my first thought to the mining aspect was Pokémon brick bronze scuba diving if ykyk
whaaaaaaaaat is with your beard mickey?  You look like a lumberjack! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You can get mew at floromora
Mikey should Talk to the old couple in floeroma as you can get a jirachi
Shave your beard bro
He hee " The water looks so... wet."
To any and all players, DON"T USE LUXRAY. USE THE EXPONENTIALLY BETTER MAGNEZONE!!
bro the song on minute 13:30 gives me so much nostalgia
Beird looks weird
Some people don't know but abra can actually learn heck a lot of Tm's
Talk to the old couple in floaroma and you get a jirachi and a mew
21:36 Well, you see, your crime was getting a shiny statue out of your first box in the underground. This is the price you must pay for your actions.
Me,in a blanket while grunty boi talks to me as I smile and try not laugh
I had a similar struggle with Ralts. I encountered 7 of them. 3 teleported and 3 had an Adamant nature ( I didn't want Gallade I'm using Infernape).
Are we gonna get Grunty Boi takes over Sinnoh? Or Team Sky in Sinnoh? Maybe Mikey can convince Cynthia to join 🤔
So for the last two days I was training a Budew from lv. 4 untill lv. 26 and wondering why max friendship hasn't been achieved  While my Golbat evolved in Crobat the first level after it's evolution. Then I discovered Budew only evolves during the day/morning
I love that only Grunty Boi is the only one to introduce Raid Shadow Legends as the sponsor. The troll meme of this channel talks about the troll meme of YouTube sponsors. That way Mikey can get a sponsor and meme them at the same time
mans is gonna become his own fabio
What happened to your mostag
12:03 The moment Mikey turns into an anime girl
😱 He has a beard
Me and my brother keeps fighting for which briliant diamond (I want) or shining pearl (the one my brother wants)
YOOOO LETS GOOO
Wait brilliant diamond already came out man I have not been keeping up with the times
The Razor Claw is only obtainable in the post-game... rip gliscor
You could always breed a gligar with a better nature once you get to solaceon town. 🤷‍♀️🥚
I love how I wasn’t the only one that was asking the most important question, when do I get my hat?! 🤣
Around 10:51 on the "Serebii had a mistake"... it's not a mistake, it's a "separated by a common language" thing. It varies even within countries, but some places (such as the UK, where Serebii lives) count the bottom floor as Ground, the one above is First, then Second, etc, while in other places (like where you are, the US) counts the bottom floor as First, the one above is Second, then Third, etc... Serebii noted what you were looking for as being what he would call the Second floor and what you would call the Third, but it's the same floor and technically correct.
Ha ha it’s grunty annoyed
Blue shellos best shellos
when i get this game ima call my chimchar chilli
I heard you can’t get gliscor until post game
Seeing mikey with a beard still makes me feel unusual lol
Me looking at the B E A R D on this man: DAMN BOI!!!
I don't have a switch but I can watch Mikey playing bdsp this video is legendary
hey Mikey if you have your save for pokemon sword/shield or lets go, you can get a jirachi and mew from the old couple!
can you do a team locke 2v2 with jack and john pleaseee!!!
You could get mew and jirachi. Talk to the old couple
13:18 bruh that thing is faster than latios and latias and you even did a video on that.
You actually got a shiny girrafarig statue nice
I wonder if the acid rain glitch is still a thing
YAYYY
Can you imagine if he was doing a nuzlocke? His starter would be out already!
Please use Ralts because Gardevoir is the Best!!!
Glad I’m not the only one who decided to call the rival Barry. THAT’S HIS NAME NINTENDO YOU CAN’T LIE TO US
In the first hour of me playing I got a shiny
hey mikey. the beard looks kinda weird. just shave it off man
Bro when did you get a beard
11:49 the old couple gives you a mew and a jirachi! (If you had played sword or shield and lets go) the lady gives you mew for lets go and the man gives you jirachi for galar
Yikes I'm not used to you with a thick mustache and beard... Dang that's cursed
Like how grunty boy got enough and talked to the viewers
Give it a blue orb just go to hoenn  trade manaphy and get blue orb trade the kyogre  then boom
The beard scared me lol
The way he says mommy in the beginning 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The beard is amazing
Does this (15:22) mean no shiny hunting?
even mikey has fallen to raid...
3:58 A-bra???
Me who dont have a switch
Add  manaphy to your team it evolves to kyogre
😁
Really hopping for this series can't wait for more newer episodes this. You are right the graphics in this games are awesome including the battle scene ( in my opinion the best graphic out of all ) but the chibi still continues.
Empoleon is the best
Nice beard
You can get a mew and jarichi in flaroma
He hasn't got mew and victini yet... A lot of people got surprised by them...
I love how Mikey just refused to respond to grungy boi👌😂🤌
mandjtv is playing pokemon baaaaat chest
Mikey is growing a beard to look like an adult. ROFL
The fact that he didnt call his rival poop just dissapoints me.
Mikey: It Abra! My brain's interpretation: it's a bra!
'How are you faster than me' every poketuber 'bruh'
Can we talk about the Route 201 music tho? It gives me “carefree kid on an adventure” kinda vibe. Makes me feel like a child again 😌🥰
00:00 Your FACE!
I planned to use Gliscor too until I found out the item to evolve Gligar can't be obtained until after you beat the E4 :/
Michael: It's Abra! Me and my stupid brain: *A bra?*
Mikey your hunting for gligar was for nothing it’s evolution item is only in the post game I only just found this out my self after looking for one and then looking at its evolution item
Oh gosh tha that beard of Michael gosh
I’m sorry but that stash and beard has got to go it hurts my brain
mikey talk to the old couple you can get something great
Shave the beard and mustache I don't see Mikey now
I got a swinub in the underground before the 2nd gym
I just love how grunty boi broke the fourth wall just to tell us about raid shadow legends
love the mustache
I h
This is my first play through of any Pokémon game with you Mikey. And I am loving it.
OMG OMG OMG ITS HAPPPENING!!!!!
You can get a mew or a jirachi where the couples are
You have no idea how happy it made me to see someone actually name the rival their actual name... It’s nice not having to fine you for giving him just some random name or an insulting word of some kind 🤪
U look like young professor rowan
I called my starter monkee
I got a shiny Cascoon randomly now I doubt removing it from my team I got it in Eterna Forest. I’m on my 6th badge. His name is Dusk and he must not be harmed my beautiful Dustox
idk but is there an ability capsule in this game?
Btw one of the old couple give you jirachi
“Wheres my hat” 🤣 what I thought when i played
can somebody please tell me how you leave the grand underground?
Wait till he realizes that you get razor fang post game
I spent 4 hours in the grand underground trying to get a female togepi with serene grace but I finally got one
No Ludachristy?
You should get the gift mew and jirachi now they will be level 5 by the old couple whome you Said cute
i just had a heat attack i found a full odds shiny buneary by surprise
Why do I find it weird when Mikey grows a beard, Grunty Boi gets 1 too. I know they are the same person but it just feels weird.
I’m so glad Mikey mentioned the spelling of Teighler because that seriously made me mad when I first saw it.
i was actually feeling bad while watching this cause i cannot afford a switch. sed life
I can’t get it yet :(
The old couple gives u a mew and jirachi
mikey just walking past the old people that give you mew and jiratchi  me: wtf is he doing
I’m not saying he’s bad but my dad,brother,and maybe Evan my mom
Howler monkeys have big bouncy ball
Michael my team is going to be   Infernape  vileplume togekiss lucario floatzel garchomp   tell me what you think if you get the time thanks
you can't get gliscor till post game... it hurts
Weird how Grunty Boi got a beard the same time as Mikey... What a copycat!
Why does everybody like chimchar so much?!
Isnt that the new one
Pokemon beard diamond
Mikey has facial hair now !
I’m happy that you chose chimchar because it’s my favourite Pokémon
grunty boi with beard is sooooooo simp worthy .
U have beard
does anyone else think that this video is over-edited? I was hoping that this playthrough would be like his sword one in which the editing was kept to a minimum and not much of the game was skipped over.
why does he looks like socksfor1
Micheal probally won't see this but alk to the old couple in floroma town to get mew and jirachi
This is so stressful for me to decide who to watch between Mandjtv and Mandjtvplays.
Does he know that you can't get a razor fang until post game now?
Aaron team when you first meet him Dustox level 53  Beautifly level 53  Vespiquen level 54  Heracross level 54  Drapion level 57
Mikey now has a big beard noise One like= Idk maybe his beard will get bigger idk
so excited for this playthrough!!!
my reaction to getting the hat was the exact same lol
Go catch a  shiny shinx
Nnnnno team rocket. Is An OUTRAGE
Um, so does anyone wanna tell him he won't be evolving that Gligar til after he beats the game?
2 tips.  Completing Pokédex is just seeing the Pokémon Holding b speeds up text including level up
Empoleon is the best one Mikey, you disgust me.
Hello sir can you please tell me location of sealed chamber in Pokemon emerald enhanced version
Mikey you missed mew and jirachi in florama town
Man shave your beard
This is abuse for my boi grunty boi
Nice beard
Wow, look at this! A burning hellscape underground!     Skorupi: "Yo." Wow, a power station filled with machines!     Skorupi: "Sup." Okay, now I'm in some kind of digital environment. Definitely won't find any Skorupi living naturally in a place like this.     Skorupi: "Well, I'm here anyway."
Mikey: *walks past old couple*  Me: *visual anger*
i like how mikey's beard looks
Mikey: it’s so weird that machop has a tail Me: Machop has a tail?
I wasn’t able to see this vid yesterday
Grunty Boy addressing me directly during the ad read triggered my fight or flight response.
I’m very exited to play this game when I get it for Christmas
When you beat this game you should have team sky make a detour here
I like the way how Mikey got a beard
I’ve been loving these games so much. I have more of a revolving roster of mons as apposed to a standard squad of six, and it’s been so so fun.
Michael looks awesome with beard
MICHAEL, PLEASE LISTEN TO ME! The old couple in Floaroma town give you a free jirachi and mew!
Fun Fact:The Old Couple Give You A Jirachi
Funny thing. I was versing mars with my monferno and spamming power up punch. I think mars was worried about that because she kept spamming growl each time I used powered up punch. It was hilarious
Don’t know why, but I can’t get over the fact that Michael has a beard now
Hey mikey but you cannot get a gliscor until  post game at the battle tower sorry
ugh raid
Only if he knew about the mythical.
his first stachew was a shiny one
Mikey’s beard looking mighty thiccccc!! Loving it.
I love piplup because at its full evolshion it has blades of death and I named mine death blade
You should do first one to catch an emo shiny like marshadows shiny or any shiny that is grey, or gory
Please use Alakzam it's my favourite Pokémon
Mikey is an amazing player who chose only pokemon who only is strong against every player  I agree chimchar is the best starter GO HOWLER!!
Omg it a bra...🤣🤣
May I say that Michael has grown a beard which thinking of it almost all the YouTubers I see now has grown a moustache or beard
That comment about how weird it is to find skorupi both in swampy and desert areas kinda makes sense to me  There's this species of dinosaur called *Ceratosaurus*, which was found near both an arid savanna biome and a swampy biome, so I don't find it that farfetch'd for skorupi to be similar
Shave your beard 🧔
THE BEARD
Can't tell if you knew what the old couple gave you and were just skipping them or if you actually didn't know
An average Onix is 28 feet in length “I wonder if that onix is to scale” 👀
i wish he named barry thud
Bidoof :  touch me
Talking about random shiny’s, my sister got a full odd shiny geodude while we were playing today
I want more of this
When Mikey was talking about the random shiny I started chuckling because of my random shiny Buizel I found in Valley Windworks
Dyk, That you don't need to catch the Pokemon in order to register it to your pokedex, you just need to see the pokemon
Michael looks like a Chad..
I feel sadness when you realize the only razor fang is in the post game
Fun fact, Mikey. My middle name is Michael
I like your beard, Michael
My Fire red randomiser I used mew as my hm mule
Micheal,I have been seeing your videos for almost 4 years and I still love your videos
I literally had the same issue with Magnemite that you had with Gligar, where they just refused to appear and when they did they had bad natures. By the third one I had been looking for so long I literally said "screw it" and kept it despite the bad nature, because I just wanted to get on with the game. Edit: Decided to go back and try a couple more times, and I ended up with one that had Sturdy and a Rash nature (+Special Attack, -Special Defense)
i think it was Socrates that got executed using Hemlock juice
MandJTV looks almost old
pls play pokemon unite they added decidueye
Grunty BoI more like Grunty MaN
He has thick facial heat now omg
If you don't spend hours the first time in the underground you're playing wrong
Nice beard bro
Why don't you make a team sky vedio in this game
If you talk to the old couple in floroma town, they give you mew and jirachi.
"OOH you can't see me, OOH you can't see me" *JOHN SEENAAAAAAAAA* that got me, to the point where I choked on my donut laughing
oh my god he has beard i havent watched  videos in a few and mssed this development
It’s really getting strange seeing Mikey’s beard
Been waiting for this
anyone notice his mustachio and beard
grunty boy not talking about stealing while making a sponsor while getting ignored? what a suprise!
Nice beard
I don’t know what starter to pick in diamond
Why
Say "KID" backwards
Uhh you completely skipped a chance for Mew and Jirachi in flroaroma town
#48 ON TRENDING LESGOOOOOOO *DaBisharp intensifies*           Also nice facial hair ;)
12:43 best scene ever
nerds : watching mandjtv plays to see michael have fun  gamers / bullys : watches mandjtv plays to see grunty boy do the sponser

I WAS SO ABSOLUTELY SURPRISED THAT MY NAME WAS AN OPTION FOR THE RIVAL
I love  Grunty boy
This game looks really bad
you get what you get and you don't get upset
MandJ:purrugly is faster than the lati-twins Also him:how is this thing faster than me
I love how Michael’s reactions to Grunty Boi has mellowed so much overtime to the point where he’s straight up ignoring him.
Once I get my new Switch and either of the new games, I am taking LOTS of pictures. ESPECIALLY that dazzling cave.
We have the same Joy-Cons  Just an observation
Looking fabulous with the beard
MY HAT!!!! *YESSSSSSS!!!*      I’ll never forget these words
poor grunty boy
Michael I'm very sorry but you can't get gliscor till post game
If you could beat the game with the strategy that I’m thinking of it would still be impossible.We can’t run only castform in BDSP because Tms break.Then again Cynthia’s garchomp would destroy castform
he didn't name the rival poop :(
Ah, I named my shinx X-ray to
If you talk to the old guy in the flower village he gives you a Jirachi.
mikey:wheres my hat? 10 secl  later my hat yesssss!!!!!!!!!!!
Nice face hair
You do know that the old couple in Florida town have mew and star baby right hm right
mikey:sandgem town town of sand me:laughing so hard i can't breathe
😑
Bro do you not know that the old elder couple give you a mew and jirachi
When he found the abra I heard it's a bra haha
When tf did u grow a beard
U grew hair in the rong spot bro u still bald hail yay
That old couple will give a jirachi and mew to you if you have swsh save file and let's go save file.
You should totally go back to Floroma town and speak to that old couple. They give you something very interesting.
lets riot for changing starly's sound to "RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR"
This is gonna end up with 19 episodes. Im calling it
I think Drifloon appears after defeating the pokemon league
Micheal: why do I deserve this? Me: you intruded grunty boi sponsor
Yes he did it ! He really did it! He really really did it YES!
no one gonna talk about Mikey's beard.....just me?
Ayo prof Rowan brother playing brilliant diamond for us              Mikey looks so weird with the beard
Pls part 2
Um dude your beard
Did you grow a beer
Hey did you know that old couple will give you mew and jarachi if you have pokemon sword and lets go
Patcuritsu?! -Mikey 2021
I Like the video but i cant stop looking at Mikeys Massive beard- xD
I love that he said he wanted a random shiny with a Geodude on the screen, because I found a random shiny Geodude that attacked me in the underground before my 2nd badge.
mikey: THE WATER IS SO WET u can debate on that...
WHY DOO U HAVE A BEARD
Missed Opportunity to call your rival Poop.
“The water looks so wet” -Michael 2021
Did you get the mew and Jirachi from the old couple in floraroma town?
3:38 did he say uh-br-u 3:38 did he say uh-br-u 3:38 did he say uh-br-u 3:38 did he say uh-br-u 3:38 did he say uh-br-u
Mandjtv got a cool beard =)
“The water looks so wet”—Mikey 2021
3:38 did he say uh- br-u
When you get a female shinx with rivalry and -attack +sp attack: DUDE WHYYYYYYYY (I got that exact shinx type 10 times in a row ;-;)
Anyone else surprised with jirachi
I think it woud be awesome if mickey made a vod channel or like his full playthroughs and modded stuff
Hm.... chimchar..
I so feel your gligar struggle man it took me forever to get a damn togepi to spawn even with a togekiss statue in my base to raise the probability all I got was ralts over and over again thankfully it had a great nature the first time
Who else thinks Michael looks weird with a beard
When did he get a beard
My friend asked for shining pearl for his birthday but on the day the game came out Man made the honor roll so his parents gave it to him early then on route 202 he got a shiny bidoof
U missed the jarachi and mew with the old couple where the factory is
You can get legend from the old man and old lady you ignored And also shave
:0
Touch the biddof
i would have called shinx raycon
Beard
Mikey is getting old that means he actually might be bald...
You could have talked to the old people in Floroma town and gotten a mew and jirachi
Bruh the old couple gives you mew and jircachi
There a grit miycal in early in game
I'm jealous Micheal!!
> purugly outspeeds monferno Micahel: how is it faster than me? me looking at Purugly being faster than Latios:....
Yay !! I have been waiting for this!!
My Team Monferno, and Murkrow.  Atm I need team member Ideas im thinking Hippotas line. As next mon. Pls hlp first real playthrough of sinnoh i do want lucario maybe.
Talk to the old couple they will give you a mew
~1:30 POKÉMON let’s go mikey
Luke 11:28 But he said, “Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!”🙌
At floroma the old dude you walked past gave somone a jirachi and mew idk why maybe cheat codes or you get them when you become champion
He forgot the mew and jirachi
Lucky I still can't buy it because I haven't gone to gamestop or target
HE GOT THAT BEARD THO
😂 beard mikey
POV: you just learned that machop has a tail
You wishing for a sudden shiny just makes me smile knowing that my starter has PKRS with no resets. Absol-utely incredible luck
facial hair commin in grest btw
Liking the beard
You missed mew and jarichi
He said no crushing bones that is too violent..... time for cremation.
I was going to choose bd, but my friend wanted it so I did the respectable thing and said "pfffft, I didn't want it anyways...."
he.. had a beard now..
has Mikey's facial hare has grown or is it just me?
I don’t understand why there is tons of cuts it feels like I’m watching a trailer dang😐
No turtwig bo like
Raser Fang is post game
How abt playing Pokemon Unite?
Michael: The water looks really wet.  Me: Is water REALLY wet though?
Infernape staraptor Luxray Lucario Rosarade And Gliscore Is My brilliant diamond team
I hope Mikey won’t be too mad when he finds out the razor fang is POST GAME.
4:13 something that I’ve noticed is that they REALLY want you to know that TMs break after 1 use in this game
I like brilliant man
It might be a bit too late, but he should get the mew and jirachi from the 2 people on the left when you first go in the flower town
"Oh look an old couple, that's cute." *runs away*  Old couple: *slowly lowers gift mythical Pokémons and frowns*
go talk to the old couple because they will give you great pokemon a mew for let's go and Jirachi
Dude I haven’t seen u in a month… what happened to your face 😵‍💫
TOUCH THE BIDOOF
i love your vids
15:42 **Undertale flashbacks**
michael with a mustache looks so weird
SHINY GIRAFARIG STATUE?
Shave
“It’s another Modest Gligar! That’s two in a row! What did I do to deserve this?!”  Simple: you ignored Grunty Boi’s sponsor plug! How rude!
Why is everyone playing stupid Brilliant Diamond, Shining Pearl Is So Much Better Then BD #USESHININGPEARL
“Viva Las Vegas, first try” had me dying. I mean, that’s all you can really do against wild Abra without stuff like Taunt, but still.
It just dawned on me that Michael is doing no shave November
BEARD
E
Howler: Evolves. Me: LETS GOO *proceeds to spill hot chocolate on my shirt* Me: I knew it was to good to be true
Beard Mikey
NOOOOOO NOT GRUNTY BOI!!!!
Why in the game does monferno have somewhat of a baboons butt i am just wondering
I found a shiny geodude in the mine. It was my second encounter there.! 😜🤩
Dear Michael,  Please never shave
the old couple gives you mew ang jirachi
Wow Mikey, your trending.
we look like Jesus made me crack
They should let you change clothes on the fly, especially the Platinum Outfit. Hell it's litterally only a shirt change with a jacket and scarf(which honestly in my opinion should've already been the outfit for Diamond and Pearl and for Platinum some other cold climate apparel. Sinnoh is supposed to have a colder climate like in Canada or Russia.
*Y E S*
Can tou do a full playthrough
Mikey is becoming a middle aged man or a cave man
That’s a nice mustache you have there 🤣
when bdsp is released im like where's mikey's playthrough because i saw other youtuber playing bdsp
I need to wait till Christmas
11:49 TALK TO THAT OLD COUPLE PLEASE TALK TO THEM
tms are in one use again
I think they flipped a coin to decide the feature
i wish i could okay this platinum is my first pokemon game but i don't have a switch i can't play it
How did you get quick balls from the mystery gift i only got the the clothes and the manaphy egg
Rip the Gliscor plan since you can't get the razor fang till post game found out after getting an adamant one
Love you grunty boi
That beard tho MMM ove it
Go back to the old couple they give you jarachi and mew!
BEARD MIKEY IS AT 100% POWER. YOU BEST RUN.
I have to say I'm very impressed with how well of a remaster these are. Especially since it wasn't game freak making them
Mikey Your beard is so BEAUTIFUL. also Grunty boi with the beard is uhh Strange.
I love Pokémon diamond so far! Personally I prefer it over pearl
Just before the first Gym, I stumbled across a Shiny Abra. I managed to catch it in a Premiere Ball and it felt awesome... Then I realized it had a Hardy Nature. Boosted DEF and lowered SPL.ATK? Why? I'll be having a good time watching this playthrough. :)
You have a beard??
man you look really weird with a beard
If u talk to the couple in Floaroma Town you get a free Jirachi and mew if you have saved data from let’s go and gen 8
Since i found this channel i fell in love with grunty Boi  Meme: Grunty Boi: Is This the head quarters?  Mikey: No this is my office
Since when so tiny birds make perry the platypus noises
Ok so I wanted to use a Gliscor as well but I changed to Absol.. Reason being is because I got curious and did some research on how to get a Razor Fang and all sources say that its near Battle Tower which is endgame.. I did NOT wanna use a Gligar through the elite 4
Hate to disappoint but you cant get the razor fang until post game
That facial hair though 😏
You can only get the rayser fang in the post game
I called my Chimchar “Tamale”.
Ngl you caught me off guard with the mustache and beard
Talk to the old couple.
Talk to the old couple and get a new and a jirachi for free
BARK
If you talk to the old couple in floaroma town you get some special Pokémon
Wait        SINCE WHEN DID MIKEY HAVE A BEARD-
My first time I played pearl I got a random shiny bidoof
I remember when I started playing this I spent half of the day in the underground because just liked it
yoo markus is an option? i thought no one would ever spell it with a k
Are we not able to watch you live playing this. Like do you not live stream?
I've been playing Pokemon Shining Pearl and I'm disappointed about one thing: Unlike in platinum, Rowan didn't roast the Team Galactic Grunts before the multi-battle. He absolutely DESTROYED them verbally.
Your gonna complain about valkner and flint team
Can you shave your mustache and your beard please I’m not comfortable with it
im so glad you kept the beard
bro you could get a free Jirachi by talking to that old man
Micky in fallorma town talk to the old couple to get both MEW AND JIRACHI
Hey, just wanted to let you know you can’t get Gliscor until postgame. I also caught a Gligar then I googled and realized you can’t get a razor claw until the postgame.
That beard is on fleek tho
In floaroma town talk to the old couple and they'll give you a Pokemon. I won't spoil it but it was VERY unexpected!!
Jokes on you I have 7 gym badges
Omg I haven't watched you in 2 months and that luscious beard you have Mikey
*Can we talk about that amazing beard*
My fourth Pokémon I encountered in long grass was a shiny Shinx. There was 2 Starly one Jon shiny Shinx then a shiny Shinx on route 202. So my 2nd shiny ever caught during a playthru and not hunting for one after completing the main game and it was after only 10 mins into the game.
I will now wear a hat when playing Pokemon. Thonx Mikey!
mikey looks good with the beard
Mikey saying how are you faster than me for a purugly but he knows that a purulgy is as fast as latios and latias
I only got crits in the game
Noice beard
On my pokemon team when I get the game, I have 2 starters, Piplup is my actual starter, Chimchar was transferred from Pokemon Go
Grunty Boi should have taken the opportunity to steal from Michael when he was distracted.
If you talk to the old man in floraroma you can get a Jirachi
That beard looks cool
Mikey's beard tho
Why does Mikey have a beard
I love how Michael’s reactions to Grunty Boi has mellowed so much overtime to the point where he’s straight up ignoring him.
Can we talk about how great Mikey's beard is coming in??
You’re able to get jirachi and mew in the game early on in floaroma town from an elderly couple standing in the flowers
Micheal:How are you faster than me    Me remembering that purugly is as fast as Latios and latias
GO BACK TO THE FLOWER TOWN ON 11:48 AND TALK TO THAT OLD COUPLE. Because you played Pokémon sword&sheild and Pokémon Go they give you Pokémon. And let me tell you they are Pokémon that you want!!!!!
Beard Mikey is weird
I'm full odds shiny egg hatching Buizel and have been at it for about 9 hours straight, at this point I'll just be happy to get a shiny so I feel your pain Mikey. I nicknamed my Chimchar Hades for when its Infernape and has flames coming out of his head like Hades from Hercules
I got to say that luxray is one of my favorite Pokémon in this gen. It’s a 3rd evolution, evolution rate is balanced (unlike butterfree and beefrill), and you can get the 1st tier evolution at the beginning. It’s one of the few electric types that are new to the gen, and is capable to learn dark type moves without having the weakness to fighting moves which are pretty common; just give him/her an held item that boosts dark moves.
I haven't been here for a while. Since when have you had a beard?
Go back to the old couple they. Will give you a mew and girachi
i dont think mikey knows what 'no bwaino' means.
SHAVE THE BEARD
i also got brilliant diamond, im challangeing eterna city gym
He’s gonna be so fucking mad when he notices where he can’t get a razor fang until post-game
When did he get a moustache
Hey Mikey just so you know the razor fang is post game so you can’t use gliscor
I am so happy that Mikey got BD as Gligar is a BD exclusive
he has a beard now
Commenting this were relevant. 1st time checking honey tree. Munchlax. Sorry I had to brag
Micheal: look an old couple  Me:that give you mew and chirachi talk to them!!
Why couldn't I have been named shining diamond what about us JoJo enjoyers
I spend so much time in the underground searching for a female Rals I almost went insane
god mike i stop waching your vids for 2 weeks and you get hary
Yay Mikey with the "beard"
Gliscor is kinda hard to use since u dont get Razor fang until post game. Screwed me aswell
OMG i said the same thing when Barry called me kid!!
He called the lamp in the first cave battle scene 'Lanturn' lol
Sword and shield finally over   Sinnoh fans exited about the Diamond and Pearl remakes   Nintendo: E X P A N S I O N   P A C C
You can use the skorupi. Drapion is a Very good pokemon
11:49 talk to the couple, you get mew and Jirachi you have to talk to both of them tho
OMG he got the shiny uncatchable starly
It's a shame that Mikey didn't pick turtwig. I would have like to see him beat the Team Galactic Grunts Jaiden Animation Style.
Hay I’ve been a fan of your content for so long so this might sound dumb but what is set style for Pokémon battles. I’ve heard it a lot but it has never been explained to me.
You missed jiarachi and mew
SHEEESH
I picked piplup so I’m excited to see how are play through date diffrent
In my current playthrough of the original Pokémon Pearl game, I also named my Shinx 'X-Ray'!!!
Talk to the old couple! Trust me!
Loving this playthrough, I'm playing through building a New Pokemon Snap Photodex-based team. IE: If a Pokemon appears in that game I count its whole line as valid. I've got Prinplup, Graveler, Luxio, Crobat, Machop, and Murkow on my team right now. I'd replace Murkow for no type of overlap but my Absol doesn't have any damaging Dark-type moves.
I tried to fight gardenia today i lost...her roserades a f*cking nusence
Bro my gligar is worse it had a quiet nature and it took me 25 balls to catch
nobody gonna talk about his beard thats not a stubble anymore
Scruffy Michael back at it again
Oh wow full beard now
I got this game like right when it came out, which is unusual for me...
Jesus mikey...... cut that beard.....
Grunty boi : i guess ill take to you Me : nooooooooo
The faceted that I also pick Diamond and Chimcar is pretty funny
Dam this man needs to shave
Your weird mikey
BeardAndJTV
get mew
Just wait till he finds out he can’t evolve it till post game
Holy crap your beard is growing quickly  Edit: should have talked to the old couple, you could get a Mew and Jirachi for playing let's go and Sw/Sh
Did Mikey just skip over the elderly couple that gives away mythical Pokémon or did he just not put it in the vid?
I like Marz's design, if you know what I mean. Wink wink 😉
Go to the old couple in floaroma town and talk to them
I like you bater with out the beard
Micheal with a beard feels weird but I like it
So in my looking for a good shine early, I got extremely lucky and got a shiny one. Horrible nature and with the rivalry ability, but I couldn't pass up using a golden luxray
ITS A BRA
Plizz shave it dosest fit you plizz shave 🪒
I'm just itching to play it SO BAD, but I have to wait until it ships to my house... *sad snorlax noises*
Wow you got a really nice beard.
13:17 You forget your own content "I would never in a million years expect it to be fact but it had a base speed of 112, which is very fast. For comparison Latios and Latias only have a base speed of 110." Monferno only has a 81 base speed.  https://youtu.be/y1NL8hvBlKI?t=101
What The Beard!
i,started diamond yesteday and your probaly not gonne believe me but the FIRST wild pokemon i found was a SHINY STARLY  how big is the chance

Mikey if you talk to the old couple and have a pokemon sword/shield game and a pokemon let's go eevee/pikachu you get mew and jirachi
Anyone wanna trade back Elekids to get electvire?
Coincidence that Grunty Boi is growing a beard at the same time as Mikey

Nice beard bro!
MIKEY THAT BEARD BRO
why does micheal have beard i want unbeard micheal
whos gonna tell him you dont get the razor fang till postgame
I caught a random Shiny Cascoon last night in Eterna Forest with Cheryl.  Thankfully she didn’t kill it.
1:46 balls of gold quite literally
Oh my god, Michael, you have grown a HUGE beard
The first thing I saw was the beard
I have some bad news my friend you can’t use gliscor until the post game because the razor fang is only found in the are after the elite four
What do you have a beard
Me who tried to look for the Razor Fang to get Gliscor: Do I tell Him?
Talk to the old couple theyll give you something
Nice beard
talk to the elderly couple in floroma town
I found a shiny zubat when escorting Mira out of that cave and she killed the shiny... I was furious. I tried killing her Kadabra but it didn't die.
Mikey got a Gligar in a Quick Ball, that’s so perfect.
“ITS A BRAAAA” Abra: E X C U S E M E
Shake it off (Teighler Version)
I will say, for those who don't know, if you played "Let's Go" and talk to the old lady in the flowers standing with her husband, she will give you a Mew and her husband gives you a Jirachi, I think of you played Sword and/Shield. He mentioned a wishing star which is what the stones in that game are called so. Just wanted to give a special tip for anyone who wants them
The Grand Underground looks like tons of fun. The original Sinnoh Underground is really fun with the digging mechanic and with the dens, it’s now even better.
Mikey needs fix Grunty Boy before his fans get mad
Rip gligar only in post game
nice beard starlord
He hasn’t notice that the old couple in floramora (I can’t spell it) but that old couple gives you mew and jirachi (jirachi is with the old man and the old women has mew) you need to have save data of sword and shield plus let’s go pika and eve to get both of them
Yesssssss need this playthrough
*cries in unable to afford a switch*
You have no idea how much I want to watch this but I refuse to watch anything about brilliant diamond in shining pearl until I play the games
Your team should be Infernape Gliscor Garchomp Floatzel Roserade Drapion  Idk who should be your flying type bc gliscor cant fly and idk if hm's exists there
how did this get 15th on trending for gaming I mean I'm not complaining, way to go Mikey!
Hi
The old couple in Floaroma have a nice little surprise for you if you talk to them
You can’t get the razor fang until postgame to evolve your Gligar
Come on everyone sing with me.
IM BUYING SHINY TODAY!
LOVE the beard
Galactic grunts look like they want some berries and cream
I am at the therd gym in that game
B e a r d
Mandjtv i also always chose fire types
You can’t get the razor fang until post game
Saw a couple of vids saying you cant get razor fang until post game, sucks if thats true
YOU HAVE A BEARD WHAT
AYO THE HOWLING MONKEYS PICTURE HAS BALLS ON THEM
You missed the new from the old lady in floratoma
*talk to the old couple*
Also its Ground Floor, First Floor, Second Floor. With it being Japanese they dont have First Floor as the bottom floor.
This is something I would love to get in the near future either around Christmas or around the time of my birthday next year. A big part of it is I want to see what my brother-in-law gets cuz I often get the opposite game for Pokemon. It's kind of a coronated thing we try to do
Mikey your beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeëeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeêeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaåaaaaaaaaaaaaaãaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaard it so big
Not gonna lie the beard doesn't dust you
I'm a little bothered by the raising stat on the nature chart being red and the lowering stat being blue
I caught a Gligar, which I nicknamed Shadow, with a Serious Nature and Hyper Cutter ability.
If you talked to the old couple you could have gotten a mew and jirachi
Since when did you get a glorious beard?!
Is there anyway to persuade you to turn this into a nuzelocke?
Hey pokemon bdsm
mikey is bullying grunty boi #freegruntyboi
"An old couple... how cute" both with legandary POKEMON!!!!!
Imma leave this here in case anyone wants a Roserade, Togekiss, Gallade, Mismagius or Honchkrow before the second gym.  Tip: Catch 6 Pachirisu’s from the under ground with the pick up ability. I think they have to be over level 11, then battle with one of them until you get a Dawn, Dusk, and Shiny stone. They are surprisingly easy to get if you are battling at an early route.  Edit: added Mismagius to the list
"An old couple how cute"  Fun fact : Talk to them while have save file of lets go and swsh, they give u mew and jirachi
i would like this to be a nuzlocke like your old nuzlocke platinum videos
DAMN Mike Your So Handsome With Your Beadd
1:46 damn look at them sacs
U HAB BEARD?!?!?!
Anyone else feel kind of sad for grunty boy? * hugs*
Grunty boi: *fails to get Mikey's attention*. "well he's too engrossed..."  **More like too 'enGROTHed' **
Oldmantv
Not to brag but I'm at the elite four flint while writing this
Is no one going to say how good Mikey looks with a beard, Can I Get A Hail Yeah!!
Oh no! Its evil Mikey!
THAT BEARD THOUGH
YOOOOOOO
Mikey you look good, you should keep the beard
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
I’ve only played for an hour & reached Jubilife (I’ve only reached there because my ‘Pure Sinnoh Nostalgia!’ slowed me down) and my current team is Chimchar (Sunny Wukong), Bidoof (literally just Bidoof), Shinx (Zeusianna), Starly (Margalo) & Kricketot (Beethovia) (funny enough, everyone expect my starter is female).
Who else agrees that grunty boy is the only one to promote raid shadow legends without thousands of people facepalming around the world
Mikey playing Pokemon diamond  #TeamAwesome #BetterLegendary
HE GOT A SHINY GIRAFIRIG STATUE
cool but where is Hail Man from Hammerblocke?!
19:37 that’s waterfall from undertale
Make sure you pick up the mew and jirachi in floraroma town. (From the old couple)
I like the beard Mikey
Nice beard
Mikey u forgot mew and jirachi go to the old couple they give u mew and jirachi
i cant stop thinking that this game looks like a roblox game
I always named Barry Chitaku and me Dritzy
WOAH! WHEN DID MIKEY GET A BEARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I can spend literal *hours* within the new underground. It’s an amazing reboot of an already pretty cool gen4 feature.
Mikey getting caught up in the Grand Underground is so relatable, I spent a couple hours there when I first got access and got completely sidetracked.   ps - Michael if you see this, you need to go back up and the Ungerground Man will give you the drill for your Secret Base and you can place the statues. Serebii also has a couple things wrong about the Underground, it seems that you don’t have to complete the story/nat dex for some spawns and items and it actually depends on the statues in your base, amount of things dug up, whether you’re online, and diglets you run into. Also the Murkrow only spawn up top at night which is why you didn’t see them! They’re also part of the the reason I raced underground because I’m going to use a Honchcrow in my playthrough lol. Good luck, can’t wait for more videos!!
What the hell is the mustash it looks really DARK
Fun fact my school mascots name is howler
Am I glad he picked Chimchar? Yes.      That's it, I'm just like the fire monke.
Correct me if I’m wrong but I just found out that the razor fang is a post game item and now anyone that wants a gliscor has to wait until they finish the game.
Mikey: Oh look an old couple Me: *Triggered*
That a shiny statue if you place it down it higher the chance of shiny Pokémon
Can't be certain without playing, but I imagine Serebii wasn't incorrect about the Manaphy egg, just English; in England the floor of a building with it's entrance and exit is considered the ground floor (effectively floor 0), and the next floor up is 1st.
Nice beard mikey
I just got my Gligar earlier named him Horus after the egyptian god yeah it might not fully make sense but i based it because of power of flight and well my Gligar was level 26 and nearly destroyed my team i had 22 pokeballs and walked out with 6 left
ngl grunty boi with a beard looks ...cute       jk I mean cool      Cooler than a fridge           stop going down now pls        stop        I SAID STOP         PLS DONT GO DOWN AGAIN IT HAS MY BIGGEST SECRET          i think I like staravias hairstyle
Wait……………………………….. you have a beard and mustache your still my favorite youtuber
NOOOOOOOOOOO (5:09)
Michael got a shiny statue
Can't he not get the razor fang until the post game?
when mandjtv realises you can't get gliscor till post game
Gotta say... bearded mikey is best mikey
Did Mikey play UnderTale? If not please do a playthrough
Keep the beard it make you look older
I think the shinys are a lot easier to get in this game
mikey you are professor roan with a beard
I said the same thing about berrys mom she looks so tired and done with life
Isn’t there a shining pearl too?
I DIDNT WATCH YOU FOR LIKE 3 MITNHS AND I COME BACK U HAVE A BEARD?!?
Nice Beard love it!
I still have to wait a month for me to get a switch and bd
you can't evolve glider ;( until postgame
Manaphy with brine is busted
What took you so long Michael, been waiting just for your play through for ages.
Are we gonna talk about how he got a shiny stone on his first stone?
He missed the mew and jarachi lol
Ive never seen him with a beard he looks so weird
The beard!!
AHH!! that beard caught me offguard
You should’ve got the Jirachi and new from the old couple
jesus that beard caught me by surprise
I just can’t get over Michael’s beard! I mean, I guess it looks good, but... IT WASN’T HERE BEFORE!
i was waiting for a voice crack through the entire sponsor
4:47
“It’s a bra!!” -Mikey 2021
I'm absolutely in love with the battle arena, ILCA makes Sword and Shield looks cheap🤣
I just spent the last two hours trying to find a Ralts.
3:05 “the water looks so wet”  Yes the floor is made out of the floor
Ohh god, Gunty Boy looked at me 👀
Just wrapped the game
i like your chimchars name.
Speak to the old couple and you get mew with pokemon sword or shield data on your switch and jirachi with let's go data on your switch
YOUR TRENDING FOR GAMING CONGRATS Also you missed the free jirachi/mew with the old couple you mentioned lmao
11:49 if you talk with the old guy and lady the old guy will give you  jroche and the lady will give you mew
go to the old couple then talk to the old man in floaroma town to get a lgendary jirachi.
"stop interrupting me!" I love the irony in that sentence.
The beard is f**king amazing
I find it funny that out of all the pokemon players playing this game, Mikey is the ONLY one i can watch cuz he just, enjoys the game and not bash it every 2 seconds
The funny thing is I beat Roark without evolving my chimchar
What took you so long mikey
Yes
He calls the old couple in floreroma town cute but what he doesn't realise is that they are the people that give you the jirachi and mew
That "Old Couple" gives you a Mew if you played the Let's Go games and a Jirachi if you played Sword & Shield
I got both brilliant diamond and shining pearl
The graphics are disgusting
Your............
I'm pretty sure you can find Roselia on the other side of the ramp by the rock town I forget the name of
I can't wait to see Mikey's reaction to overworld Gyarados.
Had the same idea with roserade, then got fed up with Budew in that it's useless moveset and it was taking ages to evolve, boxed it, now to find another poison type. Also spent 30 minutes trying to find a togepi in the underground gave up and got a ralts instead to be a dragon defence
Ik Mickey will never see this but he needs to shiny hunt gligar and catch it in a quick ball bc of the color combo
I’m playing it too
Me : sees Mikey with beard and mustache   Also me: *shocked pikachu face
Idk guys, I think Mikey might like the battlefields in this game, not sure though
It’s bidoof !!!!!
Oh my god you have a beard
mikey still on that no shave november grind
I hate that Mikey makes Raid ads entertaining. Curses!!
Beard.
This game is so cool I have a dialga and also I thought you killed a shiny at the start lol
In floweroma town talk to the old people
I wanna play this game so bad but have to wait till Christmas because I promised my brother 😭
I unsubscribe because u don’t like piplup
Liking the beard.
#beardboi
GET THE MEW AND JIRACHI BY TALKING TO THE OLD COUPLE
anyone out there who beat the league yet?  i'm asking anyone who reads this. i was hoping for early trading after i get my first badge.
oh no i hate  beard Mikey yes a BIDOOF! boi is grunty
I just solo-Ed the first gym with rollout and rock smash from bidoof lol (he wasn’t even overleveled) BIDOOF POG
if only you knew abt gliscor :(
Talk to the old couple you get mythical
I got a random shint geode
i really wanna watch this but i preordered shining pearl and want a fresh playthrough without watching anything, can't wait to play it, and eventually watch this
9:30 "The badge case. Do I get to polish them?" At least someone remembers the best part of Sinnoh.
In regards to Michael's luck in regards to his Gligar's natures (good luck with evolving that BTW, Mikey), I had the exact opposite luck when I was looking for 2 of my Pokemon. The first Ralts I found (turned it into Gardevoir) was Modest and the Munchlax I found (placeholder until I get a Pokemon I can't get yet) was Brave.
Nobody: Mikey: 3:59  ITS A BRA
My first gligar I found also had modest
Monkey Jesus
micheal can you use a castform in this playthrough. please.
nice beard lol
I spent like 2 hours in the underground, I’m not ashamed of it. It was bloody fun
Murkrow has been an unexpected MVP in my playthrough.
I'm the Sandgem Town, Town of the Sand!
This is exiting : )
I like how every time Grunty Boi tried to talk about RAID, Mikey just does not care.
One
On of the old ppl give u a mew
also waited all day for this
Am I the only one that doesn't like this new editing style?
im in desperate need of a razor fang someone help
I have not watched in a while. WHEN DID MIKEY GROW A BEARD?!?!?
When did u get a beard
Go back to the old couple and talk to them trust me
Nice beard man
I feel bad for grunty boi because he got ignored
OMG I LOVE YOUR BEARD also happy early birthday  i remember because we have the same b day the 28th
Like your beard  clean👌
His beard tho
Will you get the jirachi ( don't remember if this is its spelt like this)
So i'm watching this in a call, and I accidentally unmute for them to hear, "I'm a basic white boy".
Mikey beard caught me so off guard I thought he was jack
The game looks good but I have to wait 'till Christmas before I can play it.
Talk to the old couple in Floroma town
He forgot to stream this on Thursday and if he does the tower on Friday it will not spawned until next week
Man this game looks great! Not sure what people are talking about. Of course i personally prefer the pixels, but this chibi style is a good in-between
talk to the old couple you get a mew and a jirachi
I started today and while looking for a starly and I got a shiny shinx
I've gotta say...          Mikey looks good with a beard
I literally named my Shinx the same thing as yours 😂
"How are you faster than me?" Talking to a pokemon with higher base speed than latias and latios
If you talk to the old couple you get a jirachi and a mew
Mikey you missed the mew and jirachi that you get from the old couple just for playing let’s go and sword and shield unless you knew and just didn’t want them
Why you always be skipping stuff
TMs break but you get multiple of each one so you don't lose your head(?...)
I do not like the Beard
Why does be look like chuck norris (Yes that's a compliment)
I LOVE YOUR FACE
I have a problem.How do I hatch the egg recieved on route 209?I got it from a camper
How do you get a shiny statue on your first box? I've gone through, like twenty myself!
Michael with the beard and mustache
Nee chanel name MMANDJ TV the extra m is mustast
I can’t believe the first statue you got was a gorgeous @.@ I had to do the diglett thing to find any.
this feels way too chaotic for a playthrough. couldn't follow half the things that were going on. Much prefer the way you did the u.sun playthrough
Well know we can say mikey rejected all other starters and returned to monke like he should of
Michel: names the rival Barry  Me: names the rival Accident just because of the line where the rival’s mom says, “Have you seen my little accident anywhere?”
Beard when mandjtv
He got the manaphy that I didn't even know about BUT HE DIDNT GET THE MEW OR JIRACHI WITCH IS ACTUALLY ON THE SHEET INSIDE OF THE BOX AND SAYS TALK TO THAT OLD COUPLE
My gligars were jolly and adamant… my Luxray is quiet, so I guess it balanced out…
Damn, I didnt know movember would hit you that hard. You look like Leonardo DiCaprio, I love it.
Anone wanna trade?,looking for a good water type
Nice
it is such an honor for grunty boi to be directly telling me about raid shadow legends
I’m not paying 60$ for this game that I got at 8 for 34.99
nice beard my man!
Mikey with a beard is interesting to see
Michael has a beard and a mustache...wow
Serebii didn't make a misteake, in europe the floors go Ground, First, Second etc.
I love this video it's cool to see you play the new games meanwhile I haven't played them I'm waiting until I get Brilliant diamond from my dad.
13:15 "How are you faster than me!?" I find this funny, because I just watched your video where you pointed out that Purugly is faster than Latios & Latias.
That old couple in floroma town gives you Mew and Jirachi if you have save data of sword and shield and let’s go
Did you know level 10 chimchar sweeps first gim Werid hu
Mikey why..
Mikey didn't care bout raid shadow legends lol
Bruh You Missed Mew And Jirachi The Elders Give You Them The Old Lady Mew The Old Man Jirachi
MARS IS WEARING PROTECTION
Don't forget the free Mew and Jirachi in Florida town
Also Mikey will you be sticking to one specific Pokemon type like u do in your challenges or all types?
The games came out on my bday yesterday 😆
He missed mew and jirachi
Chimchar boiiiiis
If you talked to the old couple you get mew and jarachi
0p
#GRUNTYMAN
3:09 this looks like top notch Minecraft shaders
Nice beard MandJTV and Grunty boi
WHAT ABOUT MEW AND JIRACHI
Why do you have a breed
DAMN THAT FACIAL HAIR THO MIKEY!!!!!!! #MandadTV
“I’d love to have an early game starter. Would make deciding my team a lot easier!”  Me: sitting here with a random shiny Geodude I found in Oreburgh Mine. It was my second encounter in there, I was just looking for a zubat lol XD
I caught a shiny bidoof in the first 30 minutes of playing this game
Mikey looking good with your beard
Do another grunty boy play through (or team sky alola)
That beard tho
Wait if Bebe in gen 4 is be-be, then is bode in gen 8 be-DE?
Don't talk to the old coupe in Floaroma Town ;)
is it just me or are the colors kind of weird in this game
I got mine yesterday and chose chimchar:)
His beard is so luscious
The grunty boy scene was so funny 😂
He has a beard!
My team is absol kadabra swinub zubat grotle and luxio
What happened to hour long playthrough episodes 😢
how come everyone can catch houndoom, but when i do...    it dies to struggle :(
On my play through I’m at the third gym
"How are you Faster than Me?"  Dude, Purugly is Faster than The Eon Jet duo wdym lmao
he has a beard
Pathetic Smallant already completed the Pokédex
LE BEATD
You're gonna be running with that Gligar till the post game because for some reason you can't get the razor fang until the post game
Nuzlocke this Mikey
13:04 I like the Gardevoir inspired haircut
Love your new beard dude you look amazing
nature doesnt really patter in the main playthrough or in a nuzlocke. An adamant alakazam is still a special sweeper, and a modest gyarados is still a physical beast.
Oh wow your on trending
Micheal :Wow that’s a cool couple  Me: but but ……
Mickey you only need to see the pokemon to complete the pokedex then you will get the national and also go to north from julife city and you will find mewtwo (lets go) yirachi (sword or shield) you need save data from let’s go eevee or pikachu and save date from sword or shield!!
One thing that I do have to say is that, given how much I played the original DPPt games back in the day, I still find it weird how not only do you not need an internet connection before going into the Underground, but you can now SAVE YOUR GAME while in the Underground. Don't get me wrong, it's absolutely awesome, but it's still a bit weird.  EDIT: For all of you who have noticed the 'other' comments I have been making, I REALLY don't want to be a dick, but it seems like nobody can bother reading the comments and checking to see if someone addressed something that was missed before posting that exact same comment over again. It's really not that hard to scroll down and read a couple comments before posting, folks.
I feel like he edited this too much maybe some raw gameplay would be better (unless he’s streaming this then disregard this)
Why does he have a beard?
i loved grunty boi doing that
Shave now
This guy got a first try shiny girafarig statue
the old couple you saw give you mew and jerachi
Fam your beard looking good
Love the content bro but be honest are you actually putting a voice on or is this real?
What’s with the beard
I love the beard
Mustash
Look it up you can get a mew and a jarace
I have to wait until Christmas until I can play shining pearl
If you talk to the old couple if you have played sword and shield talk to the man if you have played pokemon let’s go talk to the lady
Michael: ooh an old couple! Me who talked to the old man who gave me a jirachi
Speak to the elderly couple in flouroma. You will get a jirachi
Beard mikey isn't real. He can't hurt you.
Me shiny hunting for sneasel me getting a shiny machoke it took two hours btw in brilliant diamond
I feel that pain as I've been soft resetting the game since release trying to get the right nature for my Chimchar (took me about two days and ended up with a Hasty nature with 'Alert to sounds!' characteristic). Truly is the most frustrating aspect of Pokémon games besides shiny hunting of course.
The chimchar line is my favourite Pokémon’s
Hello old couple does know they give you Mew and Jirachi
I forgot that this came out today and got very confused
Hearning Michael's youthful voice while looking to his dad beard just makes me feel like I'm watching a miscast dubb. It's so uncanny HSUASHAUSHAUSHAUHSAUSHAUHUA it's like "Hi, I'm a man-child!!!"
Trending on gaming 24
By the way guys, Nature increases an active stat by 10% and lower another by 10%
Me: sees Micky with a beard he has evolved to is final form
He just went past the couple that gives him jirachy and mew!
Talk to the old couple in floroma town to get legendary pokemon from each based on if you have played lets go or swsh on your switch
I really do not like Barry at all he's just super annoying all the time.  Kid needs to take a chill pill
I CANT UNSEE MIKEY WITH A BEARF
10:30 I thought they had been transported to the shadow realm
My team is going to be  Infernape Scizor Spiratomb Altaria Mamoswine Gardevoir All except Infernape and gardevoir good sino Pokémon that I haven’t used on a play through before
the PACHIRIsuUU~ killed me
I got BDSP today and i love it. I never had a chance to play original sinnoh, so this is great. I chose turtwig as my starter, and the team is currently a shinx and a starly. I am on my way to floaroma town, and eventide city for the second badge
I saw the thumbnail and saw Mikey with facial hair in his video. He's usually cleaned shaved.
I found a shiny zobat on the first 30 minutes of my play though
When watching this watching My golebat Evolved
Mickey you should talk to the old couple in floroma town because you will get pokemon
Mikey please talk to the old couple in floaroma
nostalgia's kicking in
Mickey has a Chris Evans beard
That beard though
That grunty boy part is so funny
Team Chimchar!🔥🔥🔥🐒
Miley when you get to the department store go to the tm shop. You can buy flamethrower, dazzling gleam, and psychic for 3k coins
I played it early on 11/18/2021
I have spent hours now trying to catch an Adamant Buneary that is female. I feel your pain dude. So many Brave ones.
MandJTV should play Pixelmon
I beat the first gym with only chimchar using power up pumch
MONKE
Ngl, I was an avid hater of bdsp but after watching this I do have to admit, even tho I hate the chibi artstile the battles are SOOOOO pretty
Micheal.... That beard looks great keep growing it. (not too much tho..)
I have six badges and I’m heading to the third lake and I got the game yesterday
One of the cute couples gave you mew
Petition for grunty boi to turn into galactic boi for this BD series
I think pipplup is the best like it will eventually get a water steel combination and steel is like the most bulky but against fire the water can handle that so pipplup is the best
Too many people in the comments: HEY MIKEY! YOU MISSED THE MYTHICAL POKEMON IN FLORAROMA!!! Not enough people in the comments: HEY MIKEY! YOU CAN'T USE GLISCOR BEFORE POST-GAME!!!
Beard looking sweat
Talk to the old couple in Flora Town!! You won't regret it!
You went to fast on the walkthrough.. slow it down.
Do you know TM 69 is Rock Polish 🙈
I'm sorry to say this but the razor fang is only available in the battle park which is only available in post game
You can up the friendship necessary for Budew to evolve by walking with it.
Dude you missed the free Mew from the old couple! You get it by talking to the old lady in Floating Town!
MIKEY  THAT CUTE OLD COUPLE IN FLOAROMA GIVES U MEW AND JIRACHI
talk to the old couple for mew and jirachi.
Try talking to the old couple in floroma
I feel bad for grunty boi
talk to the old couple at 11:47 they give jirachi if you have swsh file i think (not sure about this other one but they give mew if you have a lets go file)
Can’t wait for the rest
React to Austin johns video it shows you about boxes
I got a +spAttack chimchar... it learns pretty much 0 good special moves
Mikey: I will wait for Roselia so I don’t have to deal with friendship evolutions My Golbat after leveling up once after evolution: I love you Trainer
we won but at what cost the furret escalator stream
I wish I could give you my luck.  I caught 2 gligar, one with a jolly nature, the other a brave nature.
The beard is looking good Michael cant wait to see the entire series
You can find Scorpions in almost any warm climate. You can find them in deserts, badlands, jungles, forests basically anywhere that is warm that they can get to.
S I N N O H   C O N T E N T   L E T ' S   F R E A K I N G   G O
Hi mickey i wanted to let you know that the razor fang that is use to evolve gligar is only available in the postgame
I really enjoyed you ignoring grunty boy like I usually do these days hahahaha
I like your mustache
I was on a different tab but still listening and then he said "Its Abra" And I thought he meant A bra lmao
I still am jealous he got A GORGEOUS BOX WHICH CONTAINS A SHINY STATUE as his first box
Ta ta ra ra r r mom mom
Can I just comment on how 🔥 🔥 🔥 Mikey’s beard is?
“i wanna get a random shiny” has yungoos ruined you
If you do get your Ralts to a Gardevoir, name it PurpleCliffe
Drifloon only appear on Fridays _after_ you liberate the Windworks from Team Galactic.
1:06 - I just need to CRUSH ITS BONES.. sorry that was violent, I need to BURN IT. (Always remember, crushing somebody's bones is never okay, but burning someone is.)
Can’t wait for his legend arcues play through 😂😂😂
The chibi sprites are so cute!
I asked for Brilliant Diamond for Christmas but my parents said it was to expensive, so now I have to experience Brilliant Diamond through YouTube
MIKEY. WITH. FACIAL HAIR. YOU LOOK LIKE THE GUY FROM V SAUCE BUT HOTTER
THAT is a beautiful beard
Hes the only one who realised they got a hat
hello keep up the good work
Fun thing I learned, Mars' Zubat had U-Turn. She used it on my own team which took me by surprise lol
Your moustache and beard is now exquisite
micheal has a fake beard on no other explanation
i wanted to use a gliscor to but the razor fang is a post game item
1:46 I think I spotted a Castform!
You skipped the mew
Imagine the first ever statue you get in the underground is a shiny one this dude is lucky asf
WHY  DIDN'T YOU GET THE MEW AND JIRACHI???????????????
WHEN TF DID YOU GET A FULL FUING BEARD
Mikey my first ever shiny in pixelmon that I got 2 days ago was a castform   Hailllll yeaaaaaaa
i think the name was tyler not taylor. still spelled weird tho
Chimchar great it's getting really repetitive sorry if I offend you.
I have spent 13 hours in this game and probably 7 of them have been underground, excavating statues and gems. I only have 2 badges but I’m having a great time.
Michael:how are you faster then me            Also Michael from a different video:purugly is faster then latios and latias
Warning you real quick: The difficulty of this game has gone from somewhat challenging, to difficult as crap! The Gym Leaders now have hold items, and so does the Elite Four. Roark is the only Gym Leader to not use any hold items in his Gym battle.  Edit: You and PokeMEN should totally do a challenge with this game.
I don't know if you are intentionally growing a beard but I hope it fills out soon, seeing you with facial hair just feels _wrong._
Probably the appearance of Grunty Boy
Why does he have a beared
Did he really skip over the couple??? Surely he didn't.........
Always remember purugly is faster than the latis
I am shiny hunting for my first shiny ever. An Onix I found in Pearl. Will not advanced in the game until I have it.
You forgot about the gift jirachi and mew fron floroma town you walked past the old people
Awwwwwwww poor grunty boi
Hi
Wait what if machamps 2 extra arms are actually tails 🤭
Hi hi im the president of the Pokétch company
that old couple you saw were the people that give u mew and jirachi 11:49
Mikey talk to the old couples they gift you pokemon in floroma town
This was great! 😊 the team what I am using is . infernape roserade luxray honchkrow floatzel and bronzong.
Aw, poor Grunty Boy.   I believe in his sponsorship power!
Mikey, says he wants a random shiny, me, finding a random shiny in the original diamond without the shiny charm
I thought that Mikey was someone else for some reason (Noice Beard)
GRUNTY BOII YEA BOII Wait Ball capsuls
Why does he have a beard?
Dude I just have to say I love how you look with the beard
GEEZ WHEN DID YOU GET A BEARD, IT LOOKS HORIBLE
This is the coolest pokemon game ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😀🔥🔥🔥😀🔥😀🔥😀🔥😀🔥😀🔥😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
Why go back to the house?! WHATS THE PURPOSE?!  Pokemon: Hat.
Digimon is better than Pokemon
shiny starly as the first encounter
My spouse promised to get brilliant diamond for me for Christmas, but it seems very far away as I'm watching this..
12th playthrough I've watched  Anyone else?
He got a shiny statue first box
"i am the basic white boy" LMAOOO
Yeeeeeeeeees
If since you have pokemon let's go data and Sword and Shield Data
can someone tell me what the chances are to get gible? and also, Mikey needs to shave ngl...
hello
Bruh I love how you said it’s unrealistic to randomly find a shiny when I randomly found one
The old couple can give you mew and  jirachi
Mikey go back to the old couple the man gives you a durichie and the lady gives you a mew
Am I the only one that thought he was going to name chimchar ludicrous or ludicrist
its weird how grunty boi stole Michael's beautiful beard
patchirisuuuu 12:04
Me: Oh Michael is just ignoring Grunty Boi again. It's raid shadow legends okay understandable   Michael: *PLAYS GAME DURING AD SO YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE AD TO GET GAME PLAY* " BEEEEG BRAIN STRATS"  Me: "HOLY CRAP YOU HAVE A HUGE BRAIN"
can we get an F in chat for Grunty Boi? 😂
Beard
Beard
you should have talked to the old couple…
When did Mikey get a bierd
HUH
you know if you talk to the old  couple in Floaroma town you will get mew and jrachi
Does he not know that he should talk to the old couple…if not then hey Mikey you should really talk to the old couple in Floaroma
Mikey turned into Rowan for this spelling intentional
Am I the only one not used to mikeys beard
I got a shiny buizel in bdsp
I'm so grateful for this video, i had almost entered eterna forest when i watched and realized I forgot to unlock my mystery gifts! Back tracked and got my quick balls for shiny hunting in eterna forest!! Thanks!!
Ummm...EXCUSE ME?!  If I’m not mistaken, that first Starly was shiny...WTF?!  The first Starly can still be shiny?!  That’s upsetting since you can’t catch it.
I’ve been to coasta rica last summer and saw AND heard the howler monkeys.(oh and those who live in the east they were louder than the cicadas
Nice goatiee Mikey👍
also been waiting on this all day
Love the moustache
You can get mew and jirachi back at floaroma Town by talking to the old couple.
Girl: Can you get my papa? Mikey: I will crush those who have captured your papa.
Nice beard bro👍🏻
There is a couple that gives you a mew and jarachi in Flororoma town
if it will fit you have to name a pokemon Jack is Maid or Grunty Boi
I'm a Florida Master Naturalist. I've worked largely with reptiles and amphibians most of that time. You will take my darling baby Torterra from my cold dead hands.
That beard tho
I want Shining Pearl so much but I don't have any money. When I do get the money, my planned team is probably Torterra, Wooper, Metagross,  Jirachi because I have SwSh, Weavile, and Mismagius because I like it's hat.
Pokemon games are sooooooooooooooooo bored 😑
I just noticed they changed chimchar’s idle animation because he used to just rock back and forth while standing in one spot. and now he bops while doing lil-bounces in one spot.
MICHAEL YOU COULD OF GOT MEW AND JIRACHI
BRO WHEN DID YOU GET A BEARD
20:06 who else saw the  machop becoming micheal jackson
Excellent starter Pokémon choice. Infernape is my favorite Pokémon.
when did you grow a beard?
Micheal: "An old couple how cute" Me: (Rips my brilliant diamond game case in half)
oooo the beard is hot
I miss Ludachris.... BTW the beard look suits you
Old Couple: *Has Mew and Jirachi* Mikey: Oh an old couple. How cute *ignores*
Damn Mikey with the full beard based
why he look so old like rowan ?
Sorry to ruin your dreams, but you're not going to use a gliscor in this playthrough, the Razor fang is only obtainable after you complete the game so you can either use a gligar for the whole run or use another pokémon instead
U look better without beard
You can't get the razor fang until post-game for some reason though
3:41every school argument ever
I love how mikey doesnt even carr anymore.
Me: sees the comment... Also me: I already now what's coming
11:48 I was scared this would happen. For those of you who don't know, he missed the mew and jirachi.
Is brilliant diamond the newest game?
What happen which the face Hair for both of them
RIP Gliscor  BRUH why did they make razor fang restricted to the post game😭
"Woah, that's a cool looking ball capsule you got there!" -MandJTV 2021
I named my piplup impostor
Ooh, you need to shave
7:01 to skip raid ad
I hope these games are tough!
Mandjtv this starly some you beat look like a shiny one
The Gligar hunt would have been a great time for the “This is Mikey” song.
is it me or mandjtv with a beard is weird
I like your berd
Already on the hype! Started my game yesterday. My copy arrived as I caught morpeko to finish my sword dex!
He didn’t the get Mew and Jirachi
I CANT PLAY THE GAME YET
Mike with a beard is kinda creepy but meh
I actually prefer the no hat look
2:39 "you must touch the bidoof"
Speaking of shiny I found 3 this week
Chinchar learning power up punch by level up, holy hell why
My entire city is flooded so I can’t get it
I literally said the same thing when I battled Teighler 😂 such an interesting spelling choice
My man Mikey is one step closer to being the third person to copy Thor's beard!!1!
Thank you!
I sad about piplup :(
I like your beard
Anyone notice the beard??
Do you have switch oled (anyone can answer)
Did you get the mew and jiraichi
Why must there always be. Raid shadow legands
mikey has turned into a lumberjack next thing you know he would turn into chubaka
Love the beard, Mikey
POG
oh god i havent seen micheal in a while and that beard is gettin thicc
Talk to the old couple in Floroma town because if you talk to them you get Mew and Jirachi
OH I actually thought he would choose torterra over infernape because he loves torterra I’m impressed
I love your videos Michael and I can’t wait to see more of this game and play it for myself
I don't know why, but I think I have an ability to make some of cool for community pokemon bad. I can't use Infernape or Treecko as good as Empoleon or Blaziken. But that is not for every pokemon. Crobat, for example, super cool, and he is my favourite mon of all time, and I use it very often.
10:52 I don’t think that was actually serebi’s mistake but a difference between British and American naming - in Britain the bottom floor is the ground floor so going up 2 levels would get you to the second floor
That “old cute couple” was ready to hand over two mythical pokemon
he gots a mustsash
I wish you were streaming this
Talk to the old couple they will give you legendary pokis
Well this sure was a pretty cool playthorugh of BDSP
Team sky
Hi
Micheal :pinplup  Me :its a diffrent choice  Micheal :torterra  Me oh great choice you know (before me finished the scentence) Micheal : chim char  Me :yep nevermind he is the usal
Bro, why did you do this like a playthrough challenge instead of an actual first playthrough? Like, there are so many cuts and stuff
USE.....TAHT.....SCORPI
Is it normal that the FIRST day I played this my stater and my whole team has pokerus?  Also,Mikey *DO A POKÉMON TALK WITH GROOKEY PLEASE I BEG*
manjtv you mist mew and jirachi that elder couple had them at level 1
I started with Brilliant Diamond, and guess what I named my Chimchar
Bro get the fence before they're gone
11:50 did you purposely ignored the couple that give you a Mew and a Jirachi? Lol
The old man and women give you legendarys
You with facial hair looks so weird
I can’t wait to play brilliant diamond I pre order it online and it comes later today I’m so excited for it to come.
I honestly feel like the top down view work better for the overworld encounters due to the limited viewing angles allowing for more polish.
No gliscor before post game Michael
Now that you have a Bidoof… touch it.
Don't for get jirachi
When did he get a beard 0o0
Why do you have a beard?????!!!
Mikey I'm already ahead of you and already have 7 gym badges and I went to a pokemart once and I have mew,jirachi and manaphy
How did grungy boi get a beard
Took me way too long to realize that Mikey has a beard
Hew knew that Mickey is Jesus
Funny enough on my firsts time on my way to the underground I ran into a my forest ever SHINEY and it was a shiney bedoof I wanted to catch it and name it god but I couldn’t catch it and now I’m s a d
Just so you know there is no togepi egg in this game
mikey did you get the new switch
Hey everyone can someone trade me a murkrow so i can use it on my team ? 🙏🏽🙏🏽🥺🥺
Congratulations to everyone who was kinda early who saw this comment
Someone tell this man that the old couple has a Jirachi and Mew if he has SWSH and Let's Go saves respectively
Yes
Hey Mikey if you’re gonna use a gliscor you will have to transfer in a razor fang because you can’t get one until the post game. Just a heads up because I’m using gliscor too
Your beard is looking 🔥 🔥 🔥
Random shines aren't unrealistic
What with the mustache
I honestly prefer bald face Micheal but that's my opinion
I am not used to seeing you with a beard
11:50 they give Mew and giratchi
Mikey I’m sorry, but your beard made me scream.
Pokémon Diamond is unbreakable
Grunty boi slowly becomes an ok being
Bruh when did your beard grow
am have way done my gym badges and cut your beard off or am going to give you a bad riveiw
infernape overrated
Michael: TODaY iM  plAyINg BRiLLIAnt DiaMOnD  Me: Mmmmmm.... ~Mikey beard~...
The couple Yousaw in Floroma gives you girachi and mew
How he said machop
The beard is scary.. I don’t know why
3:59 I wasn't looking at the screen and then I heard "IT'S A BRA!!!" I was there like wtf happened
Such big beard Mikey. Kan we say Mike.
in Floraroma town to the left of the pokemon centre you can get Mew and Jirachi from the old couple
Every time he uploads his beard grows
Did Micheal just say "BRA" for "ABRA"
You need to go talk to the old couple in Floaroma city for mew and jirachi
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FACIAL HAIR
If the beard starts to get itchy, start using some beard lotion and get a beard comb it does help a lot. But you should think about keeping it, it looks good on you and adds a few years of age to your look.
So I didn't notice the genders and I can't remember if they'll have the same or random but you could always try breeding them for an eternity
Go Katie!
you got a beard nice
In jubbaliff there is mew and  jirachi
The old people in the flower ground town give you a new and a jirachi Mikey go get it
The beard fire no cap
Guess I'm the only one who got shining pearl 😭😭😭😭
After stumbling on this channel a few months back, I thoroughly started enjoying the content. This is the channel I have picked to watch a brilliant diamond/shining pearl walkthrough.
beard
What I like about the BDSP artstyle(?) is that it feels more like a 3D Pokemon game because in the main world the characters are smol and are normal sized in the battle like in the old games!
Dude shave the facial hair makes you look older than your bald head does
you look like jesus (i mean beard and mustache)
Love the beard
When you said the water looks so wet that’s what she said
Man… Seeing Mickey with a beard feels weird but.. i can dig with it
I’d recommend speaking to the old couple you passed before the Valley Wind Works.
I get that Mikey and grunts boi are long lost twins or whatever but Mikey grows a beard and then grunty boy does that is weird                  Ik he’s fake
You know, since this game is powered by the Unity engine, I can predict a whole lot more mods that Mikey and the others can play with.
sdf
You got a beard
You should add an elekid/electibuzz/electivire to your team they can be found in the underground
Well this made up my mind about if I should get this game or not. I think I'll save up for Legends: Arceus or The New Pokémon Snap rather.
Ludachris returns from the afterlife
I miss when Mikey had no facial hair
just realized monferno has a red butt... play pokemon for over 20 years, i know that pokemon since its birth... but never did i pay attention to that xD
Seeing mikey with a beard is super cursed to me lol
Yo when did mikey get a beard and mustashe
Grunty boy look so cursed
Michael looks like freaking Jesus 😂
In order for you to get drifblim you need to set your clock to 11:55 P.M,  Friday, and stay in the game until it appears, then you fight it.
The old people give you legendarys
Grunty boy with a beard is so cursed
AAAAAAAAA THEY RELEASED IT
omg your beard
i am sorry to make you sad but the evolution item for gliscor is only available in the post game
Please do i can only use shiny pokemons nuzlock
That beard 0-0
Nice beard dudue
Finallyyy
Boy this game looks fun! Too bad I’m busy shiny hunting Piplup, the grind never stops 😎😎😎
Love the beard keep it it suits you
Dat Beard Do
I haven’t watch mikey in a long time  Something looks sussy
I'm excited for this playthrough I started playing pokemon with pokemon silver but Dimond is the game I really got into its a bonus that Michael is playing it
I still cant understand to this day why purugly has such high speed stat
I named my chimchar monkrackle
noice
Talking to the couple gets you Mew, and Jirachi!
Do you want to have a beard? It was a suprise when I saw your face😅 I still like your videos!
Damn Mikey You Sure Got A Beard But It Looks Cool I’ve Been WAITING For This Game
When the picture of the monkey shows up it exposes the balls of the monkey
If you talk to the couple in floroma town you get new and jarachi
My brothers name is rowen so at the start he was like “ROWEN MY NAME IS ROWEN FJSJNICJSJWJD”.
🅾🅼🅶
I have not been keeping up and the beard surprised me
I like how the ad is literally “I’m having so much fun playing this new game that isn’t RSL so I’m completely ignoring you”
3:00 water is not wet!!!!
I have 4 gym badges and still only have 20 pokeballs and 8 quick balls nothing else
I honestly think empoleon is the best looking sinnoh starter. If you dont, that's fair
Why
I love the part where grunty boi comes and Mikey ignores him
Both mikey and grunty boi with beard . Some should make a meme you copy your beard i see
The mountain background at sunset is super beautiful
*troll face*
Mikeys quote of the year “The water Looks So Wet!”
No shave november
Gliscor is a post game exclusive
The fact that it’s actually shining pearl
He looks so adult but his voice is so teeny ,i luv it.
Imagine if Michel got the Jirachi from the old couple
You should count yourself lucky. Roark's Cranidos knows Bulldoze.
Fun story. I actually did just get a random shiny zubat. Totally wasn’t planning on using crobat but I guess my game decided differently.
So far the game has surprised me in terms of battle field quality.
Is anyone going to tell him that he found a Shiny Statue of Giraffirig, or am I?
It feels weird that he just ignored the old man and women who give jirachi and mew
You win the bofa competition
I screamed as you walked by the old couple that gives jirachi and mew 🤣🤣🤣 I was like GO BACK also been waiting for a vid in this game so happy to see ya play it I'm loving it myself :)
Gonna be completely honest, I prefer you with the beard
The water looks so wet 😂
I named my rival Mr. Bean
talk to the old couples in floraroma town and you get both mew and jirachy
Getting it for christmas
Monfernape
Been waiting for you to play this game
U know, I don't hv a Switch, nor can I buy it cus my mum won't allow, and platinum is my fav pokemon game, so I'm just enjoying u playing as u r actually smart and choose the best pokemon in the world, Infernape, the King Of Monkeys Himself. (RIP Ludachris BTW)  LoL this thing is cool 👍
Nice beard man I like it
Talk to the old couple
WHAT TYPE OF BEARD IS THAT
I wish I could play the remakes but my isn’t working.
Time to get dangerous?
If mikey beats  brilliant diamonds before me defeating pokemon platinum with the 5th gym badge i will kill
you shouldve spoken to the old couple in floramora town cuz they will give you a jirachi and mew if you have a sword/shield and lets go pikachu/eevee save file
Epic video (but get rid of dat beard)
Mikey didn’t even talk to the old couple who would’ve given him Mew and Jirachi
Who’s gonna tell him the razor fang is a post game item
Beautiful beard man! keep it up!
mikey with a beard is oddly disturbing
Has anyone here beaten the game and is willing to trade me any Pokémon that’s holding a razor fang
Hey mikey
My Pokémon shining pearl team will be Torterra Staraptor Luxray Garchomp Alakazam Palkia or Gyrados
nice
Just to save you some trouble unless you trade over a razor fang you can’t evolve gligar until the post-game
In floaroma town you can find mew and jirachi
Did he get the mew
Nicknames actually matter imo ( wait X-Ray is the name of my animal crossing new horizons town lol)
Mikey: "I want to find a random shiny so bad" Me: "Finds random shiny pink shellos before the 2nd gym"
hi
This game be the best :)
I named my turtwig sulcata so we both separately named our Pokémon after real animal species
When did grunty boy start breaking the fourth wall
Yooo
F for grunti boy he was ignored.
You with a beard is confusing, not bad it actually looks pretty good, just, confusing
Beard?
Mikey has a beard lol
I’m gonna get the game for Christmas and I can’t wait as this will be my first playful of Sinnoh since it came out when I was like 4 months old, so the first game I played was white with my dad then I got black later kn
Does anyone know if the razor fang is available before beating the league? I really want to use a gliscor.
I loved Gen 4 but I won't be playing this. They ruined the best gen with these disgusting character models.
WHAT THE HELL, BEARD MIKEY
I’m sorry to break it to you but you can’t get the razor fang until post game, therefore gliscor is a postgame Pokémon :(
I often skip sponsores on other Youtubers videos but how u do sponsores is Entertainment
hey you missed the free two pokemon at 11:47
Purugly is faster than monferno. Purugly's base speed is 112 and monferno's base speed is 81.
MICHAEL YOU HIT PUBERTY AND GRUNTY BOI THERES NO WAY
Yes finally the video I have been waiting for although I thought it would be longer
Yo(Rowan-Michael) Honestly keep the beard man, it fits you well...
Look at that beard you look like my uncle
Finally some one actually talk in they're videos
i just got the game today and i chose         chimchar and named it fire boi
Do we have confirmation that the razor fang will be available pre national dex?
Mikey with the facial hair never shave it for this gameplay
The item to evolve gligar is only in the post game, which is sad.
I said the same thing about the hat and when Berry called us kid
ANAKIN;I don't like sand. It's course, and gets everywhere
Ok so I dont watch you for around 2 months, I come back, AND YOU HAVE GROWN A BEARD;-; Great video though btw, Love it!
Oh tms break....
Your handling of Grunty Boy in this video is perfection.
Wait so does this have the platinum dex?
Michael Is soo handsome in the beard
Wot, now he has a beard?
It's probably because of Barry's boundless energy
I was hoping that you would upload a BDSP gameplay video....and you did!
Nice beard Mikey
ayyyyy playthrough time!
I got this game yesterday and I already have 4 badges
Since when did Mikey get a beard
15:41 POV: playing undertale
Hey Mikey just saying Razor Fang is only postgame of Brillaint Diamond so you can only trade it from another game but your gonna have to wait beacuse you can't use Home until some days after the realese of Brilliant diamond so good luck
0:33 Barry's mom looks so tired. Yeah, I think because Barry gets all the coffee in the morning.
I've browsed for like 2 days I don't think you can get a razor fang before post game
i opened the video and saw a whole beard...
e
Just so you know you missed the mew and jirachi grabs
I’m America Grunty boi creates non sense in soviat Russia Mikey creates non sense
You can take a jirachi by talking to the old man in flower town
MIKEY DID IT HE GREW A BEARD
Man looks great with a beard
I would be tired too if berry was son
Me stoped watching his videos for a few days:he has a beard now!!!
I love your beard Micheal
That beard tho

When will you post unite???
Your beard
How dare u insult the mighty penguin
That beard is the best part of this vis
I think that Machop having a tail is a reference to humans having tails while in the womb but it eventually breaks off as the human develops before birth. FUN TRIVIA FACT!!!!
getting the game soon, im so excited
I think Machop has a tail because humans used to have tails then we evolved into normal humans like machoke and then we evolve into a machamp in the future possibly
You have a beard ew
If you talk to the old couple you get mythical Pokémon
oh my freaking god. I love your beard.
Talk to the old couple in Floroma town
you should try and go back to get  Jirachi and mew
I feel so bad for grunty boi lol
TMS BREAK SO RATING: 0/5 STARS
Yes! Been looking forward to you playing this. Love the beard too
Nice beard
Why you got a beard
I am soooooo mad I searched for a Gligar Underground for hours and didn't even see one.
Mikey: I'm not picking piplup you might be a fan of it but I'm not.  Me: what about James didn't you form a *BOND* with it
Diggin the beard bro keep it
Do you know That purugly is Faster than latios or layias
WHAT LVL WAS GASTRODON
I LOVE your beard
Were is Michael who is this
Shiny Giraffarig Statue.
Am I the only one who noticed he missed the old couple that literally gives him two legendary’s for having sword and shield and let’s go data in his switch
his beard is 10/10
Wait, was that Girafarig statue shiny?!
Nice beard
He looks like a dad
It's definitely interesting to see how a beard makes a dude look older. Perks of being a dude than a chick with a youthful face, I suppose.  It's a good look.
I really dislike chimchar
:o a beard!
The beard omg
Mikey: struggles to find a gligar in the underground Me: laughs in Pokémon home transfer
the beard
Bro shave yo beard
I think the razor fang to evolve gliscor isn’t obtainable until post game
You can get a mew and jirachi if you talk to the old couple in floramora town
Beard?!?!???!!!
Grunty BOY?!?!?!?!?! Grunty MAN
Not gonna lie, this was really hard to watch because of the editing.. :( Is there a place where you can watch the full length of the episode without the cuts?
0:49 WHY?!?!
"the water looks wet" Ah yes, the floor is made out of floor
REMOVE THE BEARED WE ARE NOT USED TO THIS
3:41 I kid you not we literally said the same thing as a reaction bruh
mikey: its weird machop has tail but the other two dont me: they wear underwear to hide the tail
This game looks amazing and I can’t wait to get it for Christmas
in floroma town, if you talk to the old couple, you will get a Jirachi.
I’m so sad he didn’t talk to the flower couple
Make team sky team on second playthrough
A BIERD?!
When did baldjtv got baldbeardjtv
talk to the old couple in floroma town to get mew and jirachi!
13:19 Purugly is faster than Latias too 😂
The "lovely old couple" give you pokemon get them
Is it just me or does bearded Mikey look kinda similar to Eminem?
Nice bread mikey
I chose pinplup just because it my second favorite starter and I bet I can kick your but Mikey
Beard.
11:50 if you didn't know you can get mew and Jirachi from these two
Wow!
b e a r d e d m i k e y   b e a r d e d m i k e y
Yo why do you have a beard?
Me checks my gliscore after this vid my gliscore has dream stats
“I am the basic white boy” best line from Michael
You can not get gliscor until end game it’s in the battle Tower
With a beard he looks like a father
In my most recent diamond play through i had a budew that was still a budew at the 7th gym   Edit: i dropped it for snover
Thanks mate for uploading i was waiting for your playthrough  I will follow it to the end because I can't by BDSP myself so I'll watch it instead lol
loving the new look !!
Poor grunty boi
The menu style and font choice of the game bother me and I can't quite put my finger on why...
hmmmm after this beard u look... sus :>
I also just named him Barry I literally can’t see him as anyone else lol
The beard is a bit too... much now. Shave a little Mikey
Pokeman7 as a Clown LMAOOOO
Hey Micheal can you shave  You look good without beard
I have never seen Mikey with so much beard. Suits you though
Talk to the old lady if you have lets go on your switch!!! I am pretty sure you get a mew
lol our team has quite a few same pokemons my team is Infernape Staraptor Luxray Floatzel Gliscor Garchomp
12:40 John Cena Mode
I was going to use gliscor but I learned u can get a razor fang until the post game to evolve it
Wait it’s out!? (Also could you use a gallade lol)
How is purugly faster says the one saying purugly is faster then latios
0:30 HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAH
The old couple have mithical talk to them
Your,have a musbread (a mustace bread)
Fun thing you can trow a pokeball on a trainers Pokémon but they Will just block it
Micheal: what is the purpose of going back to the house?  Me: TO GET THE HAT
you know the old lady and old man that were right next to each other could give you mew and jarichie
You should talk to the old couple, they will give you a jirachi and a mew if you have save data of sword and shield and lets go on your console.
Hi
Mikey is ROCKING that beard!
Jeez! This is so COOL!!!!
Poor grunty boi, always getting ignored by Mikey and skipped over by so many... I may have done this a few times.
"It's a Bra!!!"
petion for mikey to keep the hat
Mikey your beard makes you look like jackscepticeye
Bearded mikey
"Sand Veil isn't the best ability"  Meanwhile Sand Veil getting banned in competitive because it's too OP
Please make part 2 please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please
Diamond
Mickey looks like eminem with the beard, it looks weird that im not used to it but he looks cool
Cool fact: around the third town (im not sure its the one with all the flowers) you can get jirachi and mew if you played sword/shield you get jirachi and mew for lets go games
When did he get a beard
The graphics are way better than SwSh(i love it) only if they made the battle animation trainers the same in the overworld instead of chibis. They could have actually done that and actually reduced their work🤔😂 by using the same battle animation models and just make the world a bit bigger. But at the end of the day, they look so cute.
I'm loving Michael with the beard!!!!! That's a look 😍
Why don’t you livestream
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
when is the next episode ?
First time I ever comment on one of Mikey's videos to point out how handsome he looks with facial hair. And even without it he is very handsome. On another note I'd pick Chimchar or Piplup. I like all 3 starters but those are the one I'd pick and I'll incluse a Roserade on my team cause I love it.
Wow! I noticed you copied Thor's beard
really really excited for the new series! new episodes are about to be the highlight of my next month or so :)
Did you skip the gift mew and Jirachi in floroma town
*T H E   B E A R D*
I found out on Serebii that you don't get a Razor Fang until Battle Park... in the Post-Game. I wanted to use Gliscor, but it turns out, that's not realistic, sadly
Was that John dressed as a clown in Jubilife? Edit: BTW depending on who it was in charge of the serebii page for the manaphy egg, some places refer to the first floor as the ground floor and every floor up as 1, 2, etc.
4:35 I actually got a shiny in eterna forest and it took the spot on the team that I was saving for manaphy
When i start 5he vid fist thing i see mickey with beard
I bought shining pearl and I wanted to use cranidos but it’s only for brilliant diamond so now I’m sad
You know amazing how much a guy can look different if he has a lot of facial hair
To me, the Galactic grunts have the same hairstyle as Goshiki from Haikyuu xD
Bearded Michael 😍
Dude, the editing on this channel makes every video seem like a shitpost. I love it.
I have spent every moment in this game shiny hunting chimchar still no sparkle
Mikey, i’m planning on doing a shiny only run of shining pearl and streaming it but i most likely won’t get the game until christmas also i will be streaming it but i hope you do well on the playthrough
You should have spoken to the Old Couple because they give you Jirachi and Mew.
wait Teighler is Taylor? omg on my stream I called that trainer “Tegler”
But sick
Just saying I was just walking around trying to level up my Pokémon and I found a shiny geodude in like the 15 encounter
The beared looks kind of weird
3:05 what do you expect it to be like?dry?
The colour of sprites is so bland
how could you not be a fan of empoleon after you beat the hardest challenge in pokemon with it as your starter? Didn't you bond with it?!? HMMMMM??!?!?  Haha, in all seriousness, yeah empoleon sucks lol
GRUNTY BOI WITH A BEARD IS SO CURSED
When Mikey find out you cant get the razor fang until post game
You have a beard now?
Bro stop cutting so much!
Remove diamond from Brilliant diamond, that is what he is.
I know in the dazzling cave you can find ralts there too
Hey manjtv please shave your beard i missed the you with no beard
combeerd
GO BEARD MAN mandjtv used intimidate
anyone else like the beard??????????
That beard, looks awesome
"i'll call it X-Ray" Lol my luxray in bd is called X-ray as well
For getting Roserade, catch a Level 4 Budew and walk with it for at least 40,000 steps. Then level it up to Level 5. It should evolve into Roselia, and it will learn both Poison Sting and Mega Drain. It takes a long time, especially without a bike, but it is so worth it!
Let’s go
Games hace been out for 2 days now. And I STILL dont have my shiny Turtwig.
Get rid of beard dude
In bdsp, like diamond and pearl, you can't get soothe bell until after mansion on route 212, which is blocked by a bolder you need strength for
WTH I DIDNT EXPECT HIS BEARED
Hey michael, any idea what will be the upload schedule?
Jesus christ he have a beard now wtf
You do know if you want a Pokémon at one time you can use a Pokémon statue of the same type.
he got dat beard doe
Have you ever seen Kaitlyn spelled catlyn? I have
Jolly nature Skorpi with Sniper as the ability?! Dude, you're gonna have a savage Drapion!!!
That beard thoooo
Make it a nuzlocke you coward! (no hate, this is mostly a joke)
Michael: “You can’t play Pokémon without a hat!”  Me, removing my hat the chance I get when playing Pokémon Sun and main series games that come after: “Sure you can.”
Nice face
Me: why didn't you upload all of playthrough at once Mikey: *Content*
Umm can’t you get a gliscor in post game
OMG mandjtv got a shiny girrafig as his first statue
Got a shiny starly in the great marsh during the video so………. Thanks!!! :D
"One of the only members I planned for this team is a Gliscor"  Oh no.    (You can't get Gligar's evolution item until the post game so I don't think Mikey's sticking with that Gliscor)
DUDE HE GREW A BEARD
dude i need to get used to your beard cause it doesn't fit your face
I like your beard
Coward. I fought Roark with a Chimchar and swept his butt.
WTF HES BEARD
15:02 So I do have psychic powers... That's nice
You looked so frustrated after two modest gliscors. I feel your pain 😩
If you don’t know this mikey if you talk to the old couple in floarouma and have save data from sword and shield as well as saved data from let’s go pikachu and eevee you’ll get jirachi and mew
Don't forget about mega evolution
Finaly!!
What is it with you getting sponsers left and right you are getting them for the last 1 month
Noice beard
At the time watching I had not started but will some and catch a ra cya cya
It's so cursed seeing him with facial hair but at the same time it's anzing
Micheal looks even better with a beard
I have never actually played in the sinnoh region before. The remakes will be the first time.
Why you have a bered
finally
I love how Mikey walked past the couple that gives you Mew and Jirachi and said oh what a nice couple
Chimchar, the only logical choice.
The beard…… AHHH
Shiny hunting is racist
Just so you know you will not have a Gliscor up until the post game because the item is in the post game zone
Finally we get Grunty  boi with out that annoying Mikey also nice beard Grunty  boi
The 2 old ppl in floraroma town gives u mew and jirachi if you have lets go and SwSh
b e a r d
Love the beard, Mikey!
"How can I go to pokemon adventure camp without my hat?!" Mikey's Chimchar  "We will go on an adventure with or without the hat"
YES!
Beard.... nice
So in legends arcoos tanjiro became a teacher.
This is the start of a legendary lets play series.
best grunty boy commercial
if you talk to that old couple in floroma town you get a mew from the lady and a jirachi from the man
I was pretty annoyed when after I bought some poke balls and caught a starly Dawn still made me do the tutorial like I didn’t just catch a Pokémon… Did get free poke balls though
I picked shining Pearl and my team for Cynthia will be wukong the infernape, yopaat the luxray, ares the garchomp, azazel the yanmega, *cosmos the jirachi* (yes, you get jirachi from an old man in floroma town if you have a sword/shield save file on your switch) and cleetus the gastrodon. and in memorium of your platinum nuzlocke, I named Barry poop. Or: People Order Our Patties
Wait till he figures out you cant evolve gligar until endgame
NOO!the old mqn and the old woman after 1st gym gives you 2 mythical pokemon,mew and a other one.you can only get it by having saved data of pokemon sword or shield and pokemon lets go eevee/pikachu. (Do not click the blue link in this comment
Nice beard, Mikey. Also thanks for the videos.
wait berry is hyper and his mom is calm then whats the dad HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
Bearded Mikey   Bearded Mikey
I think he ignored them ironically
12:03 Anime Mikey
If you haven't known or if you have played sword and shield of the women will give you meal and the old man will give you Jirachi
the grunty boi segment was great
I’m so glad he spent so long in the first hideaway because he found all but one team member I plan to use, (Honchcrow, Gastrodon, Gardevoir, Toxicroak) I didn’t see a Tangela/Tangrowth
ayo micheal please shave my guy it looks cursed no offence
He didn't talk to the old couple so no he doesn't have a Mew and Jirachi
You can get a mew in florioma town by talking to a lady next to man
Talk to the old couple in floraroma to get some good Pokémon
Im stuck with a dumb togepi that won't evolve
is there an exp all or exp share where all pokemon get exp
10 likes and 3 views. Yep. Makes perfect sense
I’ve been waiting for this video to happen
The modest gligar had me laughing so much
I want to use the same flying type (don't know how to spell its name) as him but one of the rarest?! You're having a laugh
Grunty Boi’s voice is like Mikey voice cracking for 3 minutes straight lol
Paused video after you caught X-Ray and purchased Diamond for the switch. 🤣
You have a beard now
Petition to have Mikey keep the beard
Are you streaming this?
When I get the game should I choose a Chimchar or piplup?
The water looks so...wet
Your moustache look like my uncle
Mikey is evolving to ignore Grunty Boi
22:06 that was ONIXpected!
Mikey I am loving the beard!!
sorry can't watch right now don't want to be spoiled
It’s -ba-doof-
You should use empoleon (now do Naruto run in the overworld with follow mechanic.)🥰
I got Shining Pearl and it's going to be my first Sinnoh playthrough. Really looking forward to it. Also, Sinnoh has my favorite set of starters, so I will need to play through a few times
11:50 talk to the old couple for a surprise
The most important thing in this game is character's hat
Some bad news you cannot get gliscor before post game because razor fang is in a post game area. I am sad for it a lot.
DUDE TALK TO THE OLD PEOPLE THEY WILL GIVE YOU GOOD STUFF PLZ
by the way plz do your champion team in brilliant dimond
Me: I picked Turtwig and I named her Tera  Mikey: Yeah no I’m picking Chimchar
I have never seen Michael with a beard
His beard tho like the fact he has one
I wish I could get a Nintendo switch but I do not have the money. 😭
Nobody: Barry: Calls a full grown man a kid
I was there
Hey Michael Mah Man what's good
Mikey got like 15 years older in the last couple videos
PAID Shadow Leg-ends finally decided to sponsor you again. 🤣🤣
I am so frickin' tempted to watch this video but I don't have brilliant diamond or shining pearl (I'll probably buy one of the two in a few months) and I don't want any spoilers 'cause I've never played Sinnoh or gen 4 for that matter and want bdsp to be a totally new expireince!
Sad piplup face.
With that beard, you better have some dad jokes!!
Love the video but the beard is just weird
MIKEY THE OLD COUPLE IN THE FLOWER TOWN GIVE YOU JIRACHI AND MEW!!!!!!!!
My background is hail castform and its shiny
Mikey don't forget that old couple and Flora Roma town they give you Mew and Jirachi
Can’t wait for jack and Mikey’s reaction to battling tiny Cynthia
"The water looks so wet!"   -Mikey out of context
Save you mustash and breed plzzzz it sucksss
DAT BEARD!
Fastest click ever
Okay so the machop having a tail and the rest don’t got me thinking about the other two with tails, and I think it could actually be cool
Micheal why do you have beard
PIPLUP PROPAGANDA
I got both games but my brother is hiding it from me till i raise my Spanish and English grade
i commented before 1k i am a legend
finally so exited
You missed a free Jirachi in floroma town. If you talk to the old people in the flower patch they give it to you.
The manaphy egg gift is a real pain cause you can’t reset for the nature since it automatically handed to you and not obtained via an NPC, I got super lucky with a modest nature
Dorry iam late
He looks like a dad now
Beware of of the 3rd gym it has a lucario

Grunt 'd boi
I always still call Barry Barry even when I name him something else
does Brilliant Diamond have the platimun dex?
Is this play through gonna be daily or weekly?
At the end of the video when I could replay you look kind of weird
This was my first Pokémon game I played before the remake
@1:45 thats a WHOLE ASS pair of monkey nuts
Ah yes Small people. It looks amazing, Gotta love the OG small people.
‘The water looks so wet’-2021 mickey
MIKEY, YOU MISSED THE MEW AND JIRACHI! You get that by talking to the old couple.
Mines coming on Wednesday, so I’m excited, especially since sinnoh is my favorite region
That green statue is very rare
Finnaly a person i like (not on love way) done a video about brilliant diamond (plz name your Pokemon after subscribers plzzz )
Mikey’s beard keeps growing and growing XD
How did you get a grown beard so hailing fast
Nice beard
Love the beard!
Love the video an you gotta beat more gyms to get better pokemon in the underground
The beard is working
Mikey, my brain also broke when you fought trainer Teighler. 😭😭😭
You are wired
1:04 *my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined*
I am so happy to be here I love your vids mike and I’m glad that the games finally came out I’ve been subbed for almost 4 years and I am happy that your channel came so far hope you have an amazing 2022(hope it doesn’t turn out horrible again)
Pokemon brilliant diamond and Shining Pearl cool
Proof that MandJTV is Grunty Boi* Grunty Boi has the Beard Exactly when MandJTV has the beard
Petition for randomize soul link with Jack or jhon
Abra over here with Charge Beam and Energy ball.
Mikey?? You have a beard now! Whats next? kids?!?!?!
Michael: YOU CANT PLAY A POKEMON GAME WITG OUT A HAT   ASH:FACTS
More like grunty MAN
Hate to break it to u but u cant evolve gligar until post game :/
You named your rival after me right? Right? RIGHT?!
Me: *Searches one place only once* MandJTV: *Runs in the same patch of grass*
I was thinking about you as I loaded up YouTube wondering when you would upload a video on it since seeing others do it or give updates and here you are
The beard makes him look like a whole nother person
Is there a way to watch the unedited version of this video? Like a stream or something?
you have a musctesh and a beard! jesus christ mikey thats awsome
Touch the bidoof
Can u upload the next part soon please? I doesnt have Switch or anything, I love see ur pokemon vid.
Mikey.. Love the beard man.
finally lol
Mikey the “old couple “ gives you jirachi and. New
still getting raid shadow legends sponsors lol
The old couple in floaroma town give  you Pokémon! If you have save data from let’s go you get a mew from one of them and if you have data from sword or shield you get a jirachu from the other
MONKE jesus
Keep the beard
You missed a mew
Since when did Mikey get a mustache
I just got it and I caught Machop! (My favorite fighting Pokemon)
playing some woman tower defense on roblox, i think purplecliffe would like it
You don’t need to catch Pokémon to complete the Pokédex in this game
TMs break????? Its GEN 8
“Oh look an old couple how cute.”
Who else knew that machop had a tail because i didn’t
I don't like how Mikey keeps ignoring Grunty Boi now
Do  pokemon  platinum as team sky
Please make a full series including statue part
i wasn’t going to brag but you brought up wanting to catch a random shiny. i found a shiny starly RIGHT AFTER i got pokeballs. her name is astrid and she is BEAUTIFUL.
Wait since when did Michael get a beard?
MIKEY GO TO THE OLD COUPLE IN FLOROROMA YOU GET MEW AND JIRACHI
TOUCH THE BIDOOF
I’m gonna get this game later TODAY AND IM SOOO EXCITED
Don't tell Mikey that he got the impossible shiny starly. And that he also passed the people that give him mew and jirachi
Yaaaaa
Talk to the old couple in floraroma for a surprise
No beard
Nobody: Absolutely Nobody: Mikey: The water looks so wet!
I really wanted Mikey to use Infernape inorder to avenge Ludacris
This is the first canon playthrough I'm watching of you since I became a subscriber Really love your work ❤️ Hyped for both bdsp and legends arcoos 😁🥴
man if u talk to the old couple in the floroma town u will get a girachi if its friday and u will get something if u have a let's go version in ur switch
Even in the original games you can buy pokeballs before talking to Dawn. It was an accidental discovery
He has a BEARD
Dahh your beard so big ( the rest of the video is good 👍)
Am I tripping or was the starly you fight when you get your starter shiny for him???
The beard
Catch a Loppuny and Name it Purplecliffe/Jack
First Jesus Entei, then Jesus Monferno.   What is happening
Soooo cool
I wonder why Mikey or Michael's beard is so hairy now.
Bro I was waiting for this for so long.
Finally, it's here boyz
I uh... you cant get the razor fang until postgame.
Grunty boi had a missed opportunity to say "well, he's clearly enGROTHed"
My guy found a shiny statue immediately I'm so jealous
Pokemon unite
Damn mikey cool beard
Mikey Shave pls
How did Michael get a beard in 4 days
I'm monching and cronching on BBQ Lay's
Nice beard man!
Stop! Mikey already has the title for hottest PokeTuber, the beard is just flexing
I think its time overdue for a shave your losing your luster
the beard
Love the beard
Life dew came in swsh
Hope you get Lucario
Look, no matter if you either like or dislike this remake, you gotta agree that going back to TMs breaking after one use was a really stupid decision.  Also, nice beard Michael.
Infernape is the Reddish Brown Monkey
I’ll Come back to this after I play through my copy of diamond a bit
Rest in peace Furret on an escalator, your sacrifice won't be vain (RIP)
Talk to the old people you will get mew and jhirachi
what is on your face?
Literally Every Pokémon Fanbase: Ok Where is Gen 5?
Mew and jaricia n
YOU SHOULDVE DONE PIPLUP
YOU POSTED THIS WHEN MY PIPLUP EVOLVED
i cant play bdsp cause a switch costs 50k in my country -_-
NOOOOOO
The grand underground is quickly becoming my favorite part about BDSP. I already loved the original underground, but these caverns are awesome. I just hope you can decorate your base with more things than just statues.
"one complaint I have is that when pokemon level up it is very slow" Well that was supposed to be a faithful remake after all.
nice video
that beard tho
You have a beard that shocked me
Wow I’m fast
ironically i searched up if u did a playthrough and an hour later after i did, u posted this, glad its fun
I love granty boy😂😂
Um go talk to the old couple they give you very op things
Hehe massive spoilers          The last gym and the elite four teams make no sense again just like in the original games.
I guess Mikey's beard is here to stay.
Michael cursed beard
11:50 Talk to those old couple you won't regret it (if you have played sword and shield and let's go Pikachu and eevveon the same switch your playing bdsp)
Amazing absolutely amazing
pls help i cant beat maylene i need financial support
The fact that he ignored Mew and Jirachi  shatters me  and seeing his beard I am just 🤪🤪🤪🤪
I watched this while playing Brilliant diamond
Beard Mikey feels incorrect
Oooooooooooo
The face hair, its SPREADING!
Mikey go back to the Flourtown you can get mew and jirachi from the old couple !!!!!
I am super pissed cuz the drifloon wasn't there even after I cleared out the evil team it's still wasn't f******there and you know by next Friday I'm going to be the champion the little balloon ghosts won't really matter to me
Thud is in the game, it's over 10/10!
Micky your beard is ugly
I love that Grunty Boi just decided to do the entire ad on his own without any approval from Mikey.
Beard Mickey
I love the beard
Those old couples give you jirachi and mew so go talk to them
lmao ur beard is bigger every time
non american 2nd floor, england and a few other places count the ground floor as floor zero, so I don't think serebii was wrong, just using a different counting system
YOU MISSED MEW AND JIRACHI TALK TO THE CUTE OLD COUPLE AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
my team is torrtera togakiss scizor camerupt gallade and flotzel
mikey more like beardie
Grunty boi has so much commitment to looking like mikey he also grew a beard lmao
I legit started mine earlier today WAITING FOR THIS TO COME OUT!!
During my playthrough my zubat evolved into golbat leveled up and became crobat, it had no hearts on the friendship poketch app, how?
waht the j Michael has a beard
Bruhhhhh You just got a shiny statue
I got so confused about the mustache and beard.
The old couple in Floraoma town give you mew and jirachi if you have let's go and swsh saves
woah
I want a photo of mikey when diamond and pearl released compafed with one when the remakes released
I already know what team I’m going to use for my Pokémon Brilliant Diamond when I get it!
Jesus monke
I see you copied Thor’s beard
Imagine he finds out that the razor fang is at the post game   R.I.P
Oh my God Mikey you keep on growing out that beard and mustache oh my God what happened to you
Yoooo
that beard looks great on u! :)
0:59 Michael I wanna cry 😭😭 sorry to bring this to you but they replaced Razor Fang location with Tiny Mushroom, My pulled up my Gligar till lvl 30 and learned that Gliscor is post game only now Well anyways I will still be using Gotham (my Gligar) with an eviolite. (U can probably trade with someone holding Razor Fang)
Mikey, if you speak to the elderlycouple in Floaroma you will get Jirachi and Mew
2:43 bidoof being god as always
Did you know Gliscor is only available post game... Otherwise I would have used one...
It feels bad to know that the only pokemon Mikey wants on his team is Gliscor yet you can't get the razor fang until post game. I feel so sad about that because I also wanted to use a Gliscor in one of my playthroughs.
Drifloon won't show up till next Friday and Michael if you do not go back to the flower town and talk to the old couple. GET THE MEW AND JIRICHI
I can't wait to get the home I going to do a mono flying type run for the extra spicy challenge
i picked that one
“Don’t get cocky, kid,” “Kid? We’re the same age!” got me cracking up
I'm going to get this game for My Birthday. My Starter will be Infernape.
Less than 30 mins ago!
I also just named him Barry. He's always Barry.  Barry is only Barry.  Forever Barry.       Barry Barrys his enemies.                I think I might be a bit too intense about this.
At this point Grunty Boi is just doing Kamen Rider poses
I love Mikey's beard
My Charlotte basically went through work with no problem with power up punch I believe the Geodude took two punches because it hadn't built up any power but she OHKOd the onyx and cranidos with no issues honestly now that I have Mach punch which is the same power I still tend to choose power up punch so when I get some other coverage moves later I'm probably going to delete mach punch I hardly ever use it
Flip a coin. Got the female Avatar got to say my lucky weird
If you think about it, it would have taken half the effort to make the overworld look like the game does in battle and it would have cut the amount of complaints about the game in half
Name a Pokemon after me please
Dig the beard
Mikey, I LOVE the beard. You look great.
My third wild encounter in shining pearl was a shiny starley 😳😳
wait, was the first starly shiny?
Congrats on making it here before 1 hour.
POG
What's crazy is that I see this video after I just beat the game and this was my first ever playthrough of sinnoh since I didn't get it for the ds. I hope you dont mind me telling you my team: 1: Goku my infernape 2: Leo the luxray 3: Staraptor who I forgot to nickname 4:Waifu the gardevoir and I named it this due to some people in the fandom. 5: Dialga 6: Namib the garchomp (he was named after the Namib desert in Africa). Anyways I rarely comment on your videos but I enjoy them and they make my day so thank you for these great videos.
Bruh, they gave Gyarados Waterfall at lvl. 21. This remake is wild
the old couple has a mew and a jirachi!!!!
I just liked all comment
THE OLD COUPLE GIVES YOU JIRACHI AND MEW!!!
Ohh no ! Grunty boi is addressing us directly now!
But... Grunty boi is your rival
"Oh look, an old couple, how cute"  Ok...guess they'll just keep those mythicals to themselves
Mikey you missed mew and jirachi
That "Pachirisu!" was... uhmm.. nice
YES I LOVE YOU MANDJTV!! I also wanted to use a gliscor on my team but I thought it could only spawn after i got all eight badges, so glad i can use one on the playthrough!!
This game looks great!  So... Throwback Nuzlocke?
This is the first time I have ever played a sinnoh game and the only lost I have ever lost in this game is the first gym and the 6th gym
OMG AUTORUN I LOVE IT
Beard is hot (no offense)
Please don't shave
Sand gem town, only has a small beach maybe a small jewel like a gem of sand maybe???
I called my rival Nuisance since I never liked Barry
I love Pokémon
Mikeys look went from college senior  the last video to the cool dad who tells you yes when your mom says no in this  one
Omg I did not know that it out
Dude we literally had the same process except I caught a budew.
Brilliant Diamond nuzlocke when? hehehehe 🤣
We need a team sky version of this some day change my mind
My team that I have plan to play is   Garchomp  Infernape Lucario Floatzel Weavile Roserade
You picked the best starter
ive had the game for 2 days
Don't cut out the boring parts pls
Whos going to tell mike that he couldve found a gligar way easier if he went back up and ran into the grass next to the bicicle road
"I am the basic white boy"
The couple will give you Mew and jirachi.
Tbh Mikey with facial hair looks good on him
How often will this series be? Also I laughed so hard when he got two attack lowering Gligars in a row. Goodluck! I hope you get a shiny Gligar or something (I know Gilscor is your favorite Shiny Pokemon)
Mikey literally just took half of my future team members. First the chimchar, then the luxio, and now the roselia
The fact that the TM’s break is saddening
*Purugly attacked* Mikey: how are you faster Me: WHAT DO YOU MEAN! WE ALL KNOW PURUGLY IS FAST AS HELL FROM YOU MIKEY! 🙃🙃
this grandpa and grandma in floroma town give you jirachi and mew if you have lets go pikachu and sword
why does Mikey have a beard
Mikey talk to the old couple because you could get a mew and jirachi if you have a savefile of let's go and pokemon sword or shield
UPLOAD THIS MORE MICHAEL!!!!!! OR YOU SHALL BE NAMED MICKEY!!!!!
how late am i
You ask why the purrugly is so fast as if you haven’t made a video in which you complain about how it’s speed makes no sense.
Spoiler Alert: Flint still has his D/P team, but when you rematch him post game, the team is all fire types
7:33 is synced so well
687th
Mandjtv please sheave your beard please its curse
Mandjtv with a beard is oddly creepy
Please shave your beard you look better without. This isn't my favourite youtuber
MIKEY WITH BEARD WTF?!
Bearded Mikey activated
my team will be infernape,crobat,weavile,randpardos,toxicraok,garchomp
Hi
Today I found a shiny magnemite in brilliant diamond :D
I had to name the rival Barry too.
No One: Mikey: 3:59
Everyone else is confused on why there's a cutscene meanwhile Mikey is stoked he got his hat.
mine i still shipping from amazon i’ll get it at 24-25th nov
Micheal I think The Old couple In Floroma town Could Give you A Jirachi If Played Pokemon Sword And Shield because they say "Have You Seen A Wishing Star Before (Or Something Like That)" and then Jirachi Is Given To You But I'm Not Sure about that.
I love how he ignored the couple that casually give you a Mew and a Jirachi
Chibi Fantina is absolutely hysterical. Also adoring the beard Mikey
◉‿◉
4:24 I Love How He Completely Ignores That The Child Calls Him A Noob.
Talk to the old couple in floraroma town for a fun surprise
I called my Chimchar Macho
You missed the free jirachi
Anyone else loving this beard? DAYUM!
Will watch in a month, don’t wNt spoilers
Mikey looks so dope with the beard
Mikey with beard-Looks like a true man with exp Mikey with non beard-looks like just graduated from high school and started streaming at early age (well it is a fact)
Mikey: oh look a old couple  Me: TALK TO THEM YOU WILL GET MEW AND JIRACHI
Nice
I’m playing shining pearl and before you guys say “you got the wrong one”  I got both Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl
I was waiting for this
Ooooonmmmmgggggggg
Ahhh talk to the old couple in Florama town if you have let’s go and SWSH you get mew and Juratchi!!!
Ayo I didnt know Jackkecjfknfkeye played Pokemon and knows Pokemon very well? I suppose. And is a Gliscor fan. He and Mikey would be great friends
I replayed the part about the tiny birds making that noise at least, like, 20 times
I always preferred this version of the intro over the Platinum intro. In Diamond and Pearl Barry and your character go to the lake to find a red Gyarados, and they go into the grass despite your character's mom saying not to. They see the professor left behind a briefcase and get attacked, but they use the Pokémon to protect themselves and feel bad they had to do so. In Platinum the two just go looking for Rowan to get a Pokémon and Barry just carelessly tries jumping into the tall grass, only to get stopped by the Professor who just gives them Pokémon. They both encapsulate Barry's hyperactive personality and hasty decision-making, but Diamond and Pearl are better because it shows how that's a bad thing and his decisions could have major consequences. Doesn't change how the game plays out afterward, but I still prefer it. Plus who doesn't love when games reference previous games in the franchise?
It’s funny that Grunty boi was ignored during the sponsorship. Maybe he should join Team Galactic
You miss the mew and jirachi
Mikey forgot to use following pokemon
WHOOO  So exited!
omg haven’t watched michael in like 4 months and then i see his beard :D
22 min mark
Nice
Chesnaught starter run in X/Y
X ray is really cute
I feel like the bases are in the door looking one
this real funny speed up
YES FINALLY
Either Mikey forgot he had a sponsor, got the sponsor after the gameplay, or felt too lazy to record an extra part for the ad for raid. Also love the beard
It's FINALLY here!!!!
Mikey : Purugly is faster than Latias and Latios Also Mikey using Monferno : How is it faster than me!?!?
I am just before the third gym right now and I do not have an Old rod I will go back for that now I also don't like that my chimchar isn't fully evolved yet I evolved it once before the first gym I feel like the other members of the part of your energy leeches because I feel like my starter should be fully evolved by now but I still have a couple other things in my party that are evolved at least once
LOOKIT THAT MAGNIFICENT BEARD YOU GREW!!
My brain twisted like a Hurricabe watching this
I like the beard
yes you played it !!!
Go chimchar A.k.a goku
I think it would be fun to only use pokemon that got new forms in gen 4, that is what I will do with roseraid, magnazone, togekiss, mantain( because of mantyke) wevial, and gallade
Get Rid of the Beard. Burn it…. In a fiery pit
Mikey: ITS A FRIDAY Me: it’s Saturday
mickey pls shave your beard to i cant see it so i forget about it its cursed
the chimchar shouldve been called luda krist
Prison mike
YUP THAT BEARD SHOWS HIM HE IS A TOTAL DAD
Hi Love ur Videos
Why do you have a beard
Talk to the old kuple
Since I've only ever played games as early as Gen 7 I'm gonna use earlier Gen pokemon My team will be Infernape, Staraptor, Gliscor, Houndoom, Ludicolo, and Luxray.
hello
Mikey looks like Eminem playing Pokemon!
Bearded Micheal 🔥🔥🔥
“A very scruffy looking Michael here” anyone get that call back?
Someone at my school call's me kid just like Barry
Love that we picked the same starter I named mine son goku
Heres a hint: in floraloma town talk to the 2 people in the flower patch and go to jubilife tv and in the building one of the npcs asks you a question and answer the one with wifi to get mystery gift and a manaphy egg
Go back and talk to the old couple Mikey!!
I just want to say I'm glad this is a BDSP playthrough and not a Legends Arceus playthrough as I plan on playing Legends Arceus and would like to avoid spoilers if possible
Catch a Shellos mikey
At 4:00 "it's a bra!" XD
Ayuuup I already have the game and got the stufff along with it and it’s AMAZING
yeah mikey is diamond gang
Michael: ''How are you faster then me?!?'' Purugly: *is faster then latios and latias*
Grunty boi = spornser
LETSSS goooo
Bad game
These edits were unreal! Go you bro
Not giving you any spoilers mate, but Cynthia's gonna be a pain in the ass. I suggest that you prepare VERY well to deal with her team.
Prediction, Mikey chooses chimchar for better type coverage
Can somebody kindly tell me if in this version of cento you can buy poke balls in bulk and still get the premier balls I know you have to buy them in chunks of 10 to get it in the old James and there's some new games where it's like that so I just do that as a default rather than by as many as I want I got to leave there certain games where if you buy 10 of any pokeball you get a premier Ball but I think in others it's just the default PokeBall what I should do is save before I buy to check this myself but I didn't
anybody else saw that mikey has a freaking beard now holy sh*t
Love the beard man no joke it looks good on you
"How are you faster than me?" Did he forget that that pudgy cat is faster than a jet plane?
What a coincidence that Mikey and Grunty Boi grew a beard at the same time.
Wait for u its Friday night bc fir me its Saturday at dinner time also this isnt my first comment my first one was 28th comment
YEEEEEEEES
I lost to maylene 3 times in a row so I power leveled my Pokémon and now I have a level 35 torterra and a level 34 staraptor to use against her lucario
13:18 He's the same guy who made a seperate thumbnail on Puroughly being faster than latios and latias!!
Beans
You look weird can you shave
Rowan is a professor in Sinnoh, Rohan is a Mangaka from JoJo Part 4
With that beard and mustache, I think Grunty Boy evolved into Grunty Man
im buying it on friday beacause of the blak friday sales
I named my Chimchar Sun Wukong, but I might just shorten it to Wukong when I can.  Can't go wrong with the Monkey King.
11:48 Michael if you talk to that couple they will give you Mew and Jirachi
Hi micheal if I trick you u have to pin me    …Read more
Even thought he graphics look stunning but if we’re all being honest…. It’s absolutely nothing compared to sword and shield graphics
11:48 MIKEY TALK TO THE OLD MAN HERE HE'S GONNA GIVE YOU A JIRACHI
LUDACRIS III!!
Bearded stantler in a human form is bearded Mikey
Good job Mikey welcome to team 🔥 it's the only correct team especially in Sinnoh!
WAIT WHEN DID THE BEARD APPER?
Seeing Mikey with a beard feals wierd but he looks so cool tho
Omg I thought december
WAIT BD AND SP ARE OUT SLREADY
I have waited 2 days yay it finally came
I'm expecting the chimchar will be named after ludachrist or smth like that,bringing back the first time nuzlocke
The next grunty bou cameo better be from dollar shave club with that beard growing
Woah a beard!!!! Looks nice. It gives me serious hiccup from httyd vibes. Looks nice tho
Grunty buy finally becomes the first grunt to ever had a beard
Love this playthrogh so far. But it is a bit anoying to see mikey pick chimchar for a third time and not turtwig once.
Dude lookin fresh wit da beard tho
You can talk to the people in Floroma town to get a Jirachi and a Mew
You can get Jirachi and Mew
If you talk to that old couple in Floraroma town, you can get a jirachi and a mew for having a sword/shield and a lets go game save respectively
"you can't play a Pokemon game without a hat!" As someone who doesn't use hates in the Gen 7 games I felt called out
I really hate Raid Shadow Legends but Grunty Boi made the sponsor part of the video really funny.
In the original Pokemon diamond I got it for Christmas the year it came out basically done with the story in early January somewhere in January I ended up finding 2 female shinies a biberal in the Great Marsh and a staravia in the trophy garden the next night  Why this was significant for me is because before that my only shiny I ever found besides the Red Gyarados was a little pink wooper and gold who died with the internal battery also a girl there are some generations where I have never found a shiny I found a couple in galar which were the first main series shinies I caught since diamond like there are some games I went all the way through and have not seen a shiny. Like I never saw a shiny in any version of Kanto or Hoenn or Unova or Kalos or Alola
In case you didn't talk to the old couple in flororoma townti get a mew and jiratchi
is it just me or is mikey looking like a dad
Everyone: looking at the gameplay Me: Damn Mikey looks like a dad
Look! Grunt Boi is being truly evil by advertising Raid! Good for him!
I named my Chimchar Liebe cus of it's Shiny form and Liebe in German means Love
This is AMAZING
So i Have 4 members of the team rn Koko the Monferno Trap the Skorupi Stubby the Swinub And Lastly Charap the Chatot And yes i understand chatot is pretty bad but i think its underrated and i like its concept and plus i like a challenge :)
Talk to the old lady in Floroma town you will get a gift Pokémon that is quite cool
I dont fear anything But that thing...   Grunt boi with a beard It scares me....
Everybody gangsta till the monkey starts jesusing.
Mikey the razor fang is found post game
Talk to the old couple
Why you didint call Barry, Grunty boy?
The old people in the flower garden actually will give you mew and or jirachi if u played a sword/shield and or let’s go pikachu or eevee
Mandjtv you would have shiny hunted the starter you wanted to choose at the begging of your adventure
mikey i don't know if it is true but i heard castform's forms has shiny sprites in this game
I really dont want to skip Grunty Boi But its a Raid ad.
My starter was Turtwig (only one I've never used) and named him Pogo, short for Galapagos
*sees Mikey with a beard* OH NO HES HOOOOT.
Just bought the game earlier and I LOVE IT
You actually can't get neither Gligar and Gliscor in wild before post-game, but you can get them from pokemon hideaways in grand underground
I AM HERE!
Bruh he skipped right past the free mew and jirachi lol
the species of a non chimchar as starter run is nearly extinct
Please catch a shinx
Pokemon Legends: Bidoof and Pokemon Legends: Magikarp Coming soon...

Bdsp is gonna be good for the hideout stuff.
Talk to the old couple
Grunty boy has a beard too are u two have I having a beard of???

Early also nice beard
Mandjtv with bear looks so cursed
For it to be a Pokemon game, you need to have a hat on your character
Yey he chose monkey
Both Mikey and John chose chimchar. What will jack have
Speak to the old couple
Awesome

HEIL YEAH
Me : oh, it's edited,... Ok
I got 2 copies of BDSP when this uploaded

Mickie growing his beard to be ready to become a pokemon professor

Who would have thought it, grunty boi grew a beard!
Yo Mikey! Love ur vids and everyone here supports you! <3
bro what it's out?
I am so sorry to inform you Mikey but you can’t get gliscor until post game😭
That couple gives jirachi and mew in floraroma
Growing a beard I see
It feels weird watching this and playing BD at the same time
I’ve been shiny hunting chimchar, and let’s just say there has not been any luck for me at all 😭I’ve been at this for a total of 5 hours now
POG ooOoOoOOooOoOooOoOoOoOo [unintelligible gorilla noises
idk if i get this game or shield  ,  idk what to do
Talk to the old couple in floraroma: The Man: Jirachi The Woman: Mew (if you played swsh and let’go on this file.
My friend day one got a shiny bronzor. They were plesently surprised
Love watching videos on my B-day
Michael talk to the old couple you get mew and jerochi
I love Miley’s beard I know that’s random but still
WETNESS!
Mikey: When do I get my hat!  Also Mikey: How dare the make me go home and get my hat.
My literal first encounter outside of Oreburgh was a shiny Geodude. I shat a little.
beard....
Poketch sounds more like Pokemon and Sketch than Pokemon and Watch for some reason...
One thing to say: Beard
At 4:00 am Mandjtv making a vid about pokemon platinum remake ehhe
You can get a new if you have let's go and jirachi if you have sword or shield,just talk to the old couple in floraroma town
:)
WHAT IS THAT BEARD
YOOO
i deserve a heart<3
8:07 you're not just growing a bit concerned but also a beard(laughs)
There is no greater power move than calling someone that is the same age as you kid
Idk how should I feel about Mikey with beard 0_0
who it looks really good but the chibi people
In the grand underground you can get a lot of different pokemon
I don't have BDSP but I have pre-ordered legends arcoos. So I guess that's good enough
The Grunty Boi section though 😂
Can somebody tell me, when do yo get to customize your character and when do you get to get your mystery gifts?
So nobody's gonna talk about the fact that grunty boy broke the 4th wall?
Lol 19 November was my sister's birthday and my birthday is on legends arceus
Rate my team  Tentacruel  Gastrodon Gardevoir Rotom-heat Froslass Breloom
I think the next remakes will be gen 2 (gold and silver)
Grungy boi angry 😡
Omg he looks like professor Rowan
This is 7 minutes old?????
Cant wait for the full series
Therapist: Bearded Michael doesn't exist, it can't hurt you. Bearded Michael:
holy frick his beard
Just getting a Gorgeous statue accidentally, you are lucky sir!
Trying to mentally prepare myself for all of the (not leaving without a hat) memes on r/Mandjtv
Raid sponsors: There are new stuff Mikey: *being just like me* 🌿
I’m so excited to play this
Poor grunty boy!

Mikey waited for a long time for Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl that he grew a beard...

Every Gym Leader is the same size as a kid 😂

”You’ve probably heard about  raid shadow legends and how fun it is” - Grunty boi 2021
Hi
Yay
Mikey used ignore on Grunty Boi. It was super effective!
my friend got a phisical one day before the actual game came out which is strange
I don’t like the beard
Omg the thick and luscious beard!
I love how grunts boy gets ignored
that beard is menacing
Rowan's name is ironic to me, cause my last name's original version had Rowan in it.
“The water looks so wet” - MandJTV Plays (2021) Thank you for that, Mikey.
I thought Mikey's thick beard was edited.
Is Mikey's new strategy just to ignore Grunty Boi until he gives up trying?
i got this game today and am very hyped have fun with this playthrough mikey its prob gonna be very entertaining
Should I spoil the game and watch this?
I asked for these games for Hanukkah
cant get Gliscor til postgame,  the razer fang is post game
His beard is AWESOME
Having a beard on Mikey is evil
NO IGNORING  GRUNTY BOI
YESSS
Hej
His mustrak and Beard look like a different When I came inside this video l think is this MandJ😐😔
Bearded Micheal
4:25 that kid called Mikey a noob
Did you say “it’s a bra” for the fact that it definitely will become a meme

Let's wait till Mikey gets trapped and never gets out of the mines.
Noice beard
I was unlucky enough to get a shiny starly when I was trying to get a shiny starter, I’m still going and still no shiny starter and I now hate starly
John mentions a clown picture in a stream then we see said picture coincidence I think not
heh im in the first 1000 viewers  also nice beard
3:10 how is the magikarp flopping ON WATER!!!
0:59 *Me who used Torterra and Gliscor on his team in Pearl* rude (I traded in a Gligar in case you were wondering)
You took Chimchar as your starter, *HELL YEAH!!*
Yay
Which version is more worth it? Debating on which to get
Fear the beard
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates . 🎈
