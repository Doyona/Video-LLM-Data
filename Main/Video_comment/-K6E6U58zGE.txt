Literally every coastal person is raging over how he broke a coconut
Which do you think is better, Atlantic or Pacific lobster?
Holy shit that looks good!!!!!
Bro not going to lie that's pretty sexy
That coconut went bad
At least show the lobster some respect before you kill it.
You gotta open your own restaurant id eat their every dam day
Lobsters are starting to extinct, *welp.*
In the Bengali culture of India, we have a similar concept of serving lobster in coconut....except for the fact, that the lobster itself cooked inside the coconut, under ground due to the immense heat. It tasted delicious and is called "Daab-Chingri". Daab=coconut; Chingri=Shrimp/lobster.
Studio c
Man living with Max would be awesome cause he makes food
I will try that one day. I love lobster 🦞 😋
Looks poggers, Max!
My dad would call that wasting for some reason but fr it’ll probably be better some other way other then making it into other cheap foods it should go in other expensive foods not cheap stuff like fries
How are you not 300 lbs?  Are you in the gym every minute you're not do vids
Bro i want that sandwich
I like you content and all and i would like to make something from here but i am alergic to seafood and red meat

Any one think what ever he cooks he makes it look sexy
He was like they are alive then snap dead
I'm Samoan and coconut cracking is one of my fav things to do, my opinion is look at the three lines from the holes on top, then hit each one hard from the side, one after another
how to ruin lobster:
IM SO HUNGRY GIVE IT TO ME 🙄
The meat guy? Bro he used bread, butter, and cheese, therefore, he is a liar, he isn’t the meat guy
THIS MAKES ME HUNGRY EVERY-TIME

That’s technically a lobster melt, but I will let it slide.
Boston Lobster sucks. Maine lobster is superior in every way. I dont eat seafood,
*bold of you to assume i can afford lobster*
ok that looks good though 👁👄👁
Omg that looks like the best grilled cheese in the entire world like seriously
Cut the end of the tails off or your eating shit. Just sayin
Maine lobster>Boston lobster

I'll never understand this shit. Seafood tastes like disgusting pond water scene and monsters are just sea crickets. Fuck that. That's not food, that's fishing bait.
Omaigaddddddd
How fresh is the lobster before I call peta
Wow, look at that!!! He actually humanely killed his lobster before cutting it up and removing, its meat!!! Gee, I really love this video!!!
He's using a hammer to open a coconut interesting...

Y'all not talking about how he snapped the life out of those lobsters?
Hmmm i see No apple word here...
I'm not gonna rage you but, if you want to drink coconut, better use the younger coconut, when the coconut is still green, brown coconut is old and the water is not as good as green coconut

That's not a grilled cheese
As Filipino, the moment you started using a hammer to break the coconut hurt my heart 😂
That vegan teacher should react to this.. she just needs to stop. Like. We get it. You want the world to become overpopulated and overrun by animals.
I’ll take your entire stock
You lost me at coconut milk
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Wait your supposed to take the shell off?
That's just lobster sandwich with cheese
All i want is that lobster grilled cheese HOLY SHIT 😛😛😛. U can keep the rest

Putting it in the coconut was so extra lmaooo

When will cooks realize that PARMESAN DOESNT BELONG ON A GRILLED CHEESE
Boston???? Hell no.... Maine lobster hell yeah!!!

You and me have two very different meanings of simple bro.
Did he say ”today is all about fresh lobster lobster“?
this is the fanciest fucking grilled cheese ive seen
Looks amazing,

You can tell that Lobster really loves cheese
Oh crap.. the thing moved (on the right)

That is a disgrace to lobster. I have never seen anyone make lobster like that. Good luck ingesting that. 🤢🤢
Yikes
It came from prison food to now this
Does lobster taste the same as shrimps? Cause sadly I’m allergic to shrimps
Lobster x cheese the best ship
That looks so good keep up the good work
I'm from the coast of Maine. Brothers are lobstermen, until you have cooked a ice cold lobster directly out of the ocean cooked in seaweed saltwater on the deck of the lobster boat during hardshell season you have not had the best lobster!!
The way you break the coconut hurt my ass so bad.
I’m the only one who felt bad at the first scene
Mans has the power to make a lobster cooked at the snap of his fingers
Max the Lobster Guy
When i look videos like this i feel poor._.
did you kill the lobster before cooking i couldnt tell
Forgot to say “that’s amazing”
I’m so hungry now. End results look so beautiful!
No heavy cream in a bisque? I’m so intrigued! Wish I was good enough in the kitchen to try this out for myself. Looks sooo good!
California lobster is better
If only I wasn’t allergic
I don't like grilled cheese or lobster but boy does that look delicious!
That bread looked so good
I've seen so many of his videos so I thought he was going to pour the coconut on it
Lobster bee-yusque

Man I just cant imagine lobster and coconut very well together! But I won't knock it til I try it!! Look delicious 💪
You know, living in the boston. We have lobster a few times a year. You don’t need to make this seem so sophisticated. Like you just made some very below average looking lobster homie.

"Lobster x cheese". Or...how to ruin a beautiful lobster !
HOLY SHIT I WANT THAT. also do u have any recommendations on how to cook a lobster? I heard its hard

When you open a coconut u can actually split it perfectly in half with the flat of a knife, using a hammer makes it imperfect n its more unnecessary work
Why coconut milk
Vegetarians watching this
What a shame cheese and lobster...

Underwater crabs and lobster  watching  this:😅 I know your kidding wait- where did the kids go- 😳

That looks good asf
Bro I’m so damn hungry now.

It looks good but I don't think you should put the soup in the coconut

I was wanting to eat that until he said “wine”
Idk why but this sounded so much like sam the cooking guy in a good way

You should make brunchwieger
*That Vegan Teacher is typing*
Finally no bacon😀😀😀
As a professional chef, this disappoints me. Roast your shells homie!
Where's the bacon? Better put pork less in the title or else everyone will think there's bacon when there isn't!
.
Actually the sandwich is a melt because if it contains anything other than cheese or butter it isn't grilled cheese /j
الله يديم النعمه
Red do be looking kinda sus
Im from africa if my mom ever saw me breaking a coconut with a hammer I wouldn’t be alive to tell the story😂😂😂
Coconut threw me off fr
I don't like coconut .-.
Sir that is a melt.
Lobster doesnt go on coconut
Ngl lobster tail looks like an oversized shrimp
Why serve this in a coconut?
omg that looks so good😳
That looks bad in my opinion.
Epic, what’s the song too?
Cajun lobster ya meant?
dairy with seafood 🤨
The coconut is rotten though :(
Give it to me now
Parmesan chunk ruined that sandwich and that coconut water is a little suspicious. 🤙
Hell yea max I like this one. Definitely stealing ur idea.  U didn't read that 😂
I’ve seen you on tik toc
How to ruin a lobster
Fun fact:a long time ago lobsters were actually seen as "the cockroach of the sea" because there were so many and people were sick of em even as much as to serve lobster as regular prison food
I dont even like lobster but this looks so good im willing to try it anyways🤤
Im not the only one who thinks this guys is annoying right?
Larry 😟🥺
That looked so good and making my mouth water
I heard my snapping turtle was drooling...
That's looks good homie 👁️👄👁️
I wanna say though, it was unnecessary to out the bisque in the lobster. That adds a sweeter taste to the bisque. That's not what I would want in my bisque. But hey, you do you man! Other than that, it looked absolutely amazing!
tbh, that seams bad
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
You make seal dishes?
That  looks so good
Seems like to much work
Dude you sound like the arby's commercials 🔥
Plot twist he’s actually Gordon Ramsey
When he cut the sandwich it sounded so satisfying
Ya nasty ass COCONUT WITH SEA FOOD- hell no see yt need to stop
This guy makes some great food the only real thing I thought was stupid was the beef Wellington cake challenge it was a waist of food other than that he does a good job and has made me hungry many times.....
We use a machete kind of thing to break open our coconut much easier and sharp...
This is good, just don't overreact for view and you are good to go!
As Gordon Ramsey would say: you just ruined lobster you donut
Why do i find ”lobster X cheese” funny?
Hi master chef from season 10 guy!
Gordon be fuming
Yum
Applewood, low and slow
I am vegetarian but this is just damnnn 😍
Gross!
you only just need to hit the coconut with back of knife
😲
What did that lobster ever do to you
I don't even like seafood but this looks hella good
why the fuck did you out the bisque in the coconut
Careful with how much raw coconut water you guys drink can actually give you diarrhea
How babaies arebnadd
EEwW
fun fact, Lobster who was over running in the Massachusetts Boston Harbor area there were so many which mean that they were stupid cheap and they were never considered a delicacy and very dirty because they scoured the ocean floor trash from the boats that will dock what's up how overtime all that change and someone found a way to make money off them
Why do I hear the grubhub ad in the background at certain points
Max you gotta do the Chinese glazed ribs man

Can never get over how comfortable we are just breaking this animal in half on camera
Everyone's gangsta until Gordon Ramsay says it's bad

Change my mind but i thinks lobster tastes the best just cooked and done, maybe a little mayonnaise but that’s it
Me who eats cereal for 3 meals a day
Sounds like a death sentence for me 💀  (I’m allergic to shellfish)
Why is it in a coconut?
When did TikTok become master chef
Every rich kids breakfast be like:
HERBS WITH A H!!! 😂 I’m from England who invented the ENGLISH language and trust me, it’s Herbs pronounced”hurbs “
Honestly I really respect this one
As a mainer I approve of this meal
That looks appetizing!
This is one of the only good things this man has cooked
The way he brakes the coconut is just so wrong. Cracked the shell to a million pieces
Atleast he didnt rape the food that much
Ngl that bread looks 👌
He really put lobster in a fukin coconut
That looks so F ing good
Do it simple.. just some salt when u cook it. then mayonese, a sprinkle og lemon juice, some basilikum, salad, butter and bread..🍞🦞🍋🥬
I wonder if he removed the poop sack they have
Your videos keep making me hungry
I wish I wasn't allergic to shellfish
Why did i get this recomended
WHY DIDNT YOU EAT THE MEAT OF THE COCONUY
I Want this now
I've never had lobster but would certainly like to try one
Mmm really good.
How stupid is hammering a coconut? Just use a freaking bolo or mini axe jeez😪
Super simple... just add lobster broth
Grilled cheese for rich ppl
Why's that lobster so juicy
Lobsters are just big crabs
Y would you combine cheese and lobster smh
Mmmmm
That pull out game week
Im angry rn why did he opened the coconut like that
No one is gunna talk about how he killed a lobster in the snap of a finger
I personally like crab more some people say they're exactly the same but they're different to me lobster just doesn't have the right taste
Between the cheese giving my stomach the one two and the laxatives from coconut water destroying my intestines, my stomach will love and hate me for about 30 minutes
Gib
I'm just gonna eat the sandwich
Rip
Its a melt
I never understood how people like cheese on seafood not my slice of pie
Gorden Ramsey watching this        You donut
Nice.
It looks good and I don’t even like lobster
I always cringe when a guy like him says the word     *Lobster*
My stomach grumbled in poor
What did the poor coconut did to you to deserve that?
Boston. Lobster!!! Not even Maine lobster could have made it so much better
all i can say is *Legend*
That isn’t a grilled cheese, that’s a melt you buffoon
Alternative title: how to hide the flavor of your main ingredient.
Born and raised in Kansas City Kansas and no appreciation for Sea food
Lol..  Using hammer to open coconut
Man I want that spatula you have sounds like a knife
Lynja still best
The scraping eritates my ears
Why can’t you just make normal dishes not Cinnamon Toast Crunch Wellington just simple ole dishes
Oh yes daddy
Uncle Rey
Pro tip to opening a coconut: The coconut has three dots at one end we call it a face 2 eyes and a mouth. Between the eyes runs a line. Use a hard object and hit perpendicular to that line and it will break it in 2 and will be more presentable. 👌🏾✊🏿
Tried this and the lobster is overpowered by the cheese, not good
Looks delicious I haven’t had lobster in a while.
Mans said follow on instagram if you liked this content, bruh what should i do if i hated it. Bloody disgusting.
You lost me at putting the Bisque in the coconut...
I dont really ship lobster x cheese but i do think they both are great people, they just wouldnt work it out together
I’m fucking eating Pizza Hut whil watching this and no there is no cheese pull
The only second thing I'll eat that he has made no offense but I'm not the type to eat medium rare
I have shellfish allergies and I would LITERALLY DIE to have this
Coconut shrimp soup
NO ONE CARES ITS FUCKING SHTI
I feel poor and hungry watching this
Not a grilled cheese smh
Dieing like Larry....
Erm, in Indonesia we do not drink old coconut, we drink the green ones, which many people told us that it is disgusting.   Sorry for bad english
Did this dude really just add in the sound of the spatula grazing the crust??
HERESY! By definition that is not a grilled cheese, it is a lobster melt. Still looks yummy tho
Not sure how I feel about the coconut bowl... looks good though!
I bet you can be the best chef in the world 🌎
I cant even make normal grilled cheese without setting off the fire alarm
Sweet Moses
That looks disgusting
Wrap up your present
Did you leave the bands on them while cooking........rookie
I bet you significant other is never hungry, 🤤
Ew cheese and lobster does not do it  foe me cheif
that is pro lober
Sir when I was 8 I could smash a coconut in a stone stair with ease tf u need a hammer for?
This sounds like an ad for a dinner on tv.
I m hungry now I’m just making pizza for my family of 6 and I’m 11 I’m making it all by my self and I can make more stuff tho like tater tot
Oh my 🤭 I want some
Would be great If I could taste it😭😭
What happened to cooking it on Apple Wood "low and slowwww"?
Now every chef youtuber gonna be doing  grilled cheese sandwich
The way he opened the coconut made me triggered since Filipinos open it in another way
Just give me toasted butter I don't have time to prepare all of this I'm late shit
I literally came after watching this
Imagine *that vegan teacher* reacting to this
That's a melt.. not a grilled cheese.. but ok
Its funny cause the video right before this one is lobster amc and cheese
Your voice violates me
Why did Gordon Ramsay made fun of this dude the look good
Finally something that doesn’t look like it would make your heart pump in reverse
Gordon can hate you all he wants.but at least your cheese actually melts 🤭
V
All of this looks so good
oh my god,i cant believe my eyes,this is so original,thank go nobody elese have done it😑
I’ve never tried lobster. This makes me want to eat lobster every day.
two things ive learned from these videos: 1) after max takes a bite he says “mmmm” 2) after max takes a bite he says “wow”
POV: You’re hungry and you enjoy torturing yourself
Replacing the classic "wow" at the end with just an "mmm" nowadays, I see. This man thinks before he becomes a meme.
Wait...what did he just do with coconut
Okay but Boston Lobster isnt as good as shit from New Bedford boats. Fun Fact for all those who didnt learn this in school, New Bedford, Massachusetts was once the biggest whaling port in Massachusetts and was once a wealthy town due to this and the selling of Ambergris; once whaling and the farming of Ambergris became illegal New Bedford had to sort to other means of income via port so they turned to fishing and quahoging and grew positive notoriety for the quality of seafood being brought in.
Can you say low and slow for me?
oml 😭🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
I learned two things from this video 1.How to make lobster grilled cheese  2.That I'm allergic to shellfish
😍
Creamy cheesy rawy etc
But you didn’t say “that is amazing” at the end.
YOU DONUT
Yum it’s tastes so good
If you ask me this is destroying food you just make it fancy not a fan of this one
you know this dude has a ego *not that you could already tell in his voice and appearance* but when he changes the name from “Maine lobster” to “Boston lobster” because it sounded cooler for the video
I wish you where my Chef 😋
I think the point of grilled cheese and soup is that is super easy and fast to make.
Dang I’d really hate to be known for putting meat in my mouth.
Stop u make me hungry
EWWWWW DISGUSTING
ME POV: babe we need to buy a lobster
YOM 🤤
There was a video with a clickbait e girl as the thumbnail so it was either this video or that one and I gotta say, I’m glad to have chosen this video
I'm noticing a distinct lack of cheddar but I don't know if thatll go well with lobster
Ew
Ee
Imagine a vegan stepping upon this man's yt channel 😂😂😂...
This is the worst I’ve seen him cook. I would rather eat bats from wuhan.
Oh my god
Too booji for me
Now sell it for 1000$
This man is dangerous
Wth is shark provolone
i- putting soup in a coconut no thanks
I was witchu until you poured that lobster concoction into a fuckin coconut
Him vs Gordon Ramsey
Stop making your food look so good it’s making everyone jealous here
Where's the apple wood?
STOP SCRATCHING THE FUCKING BREAD
Aw yes that is very gooddd😊😋
Boston lobster over priced over rated. I still love it🤣
This isn't Max, where's the apple wood?
That looks sooooo good🤤
That's disgusting
That's just nasty.
younger coconut is more bettet to make as a drink, for old coconut are only good for making coconut milk,coconut oil ( by cook the coconut milk ) and shreded coconut ( only the white mead inside not the shell) . Different between younger n old is the meat inside , younger coconut has more slightly white color ,soft and gelatin texture meanwhile older coconut meat is more hard, pure white color and very crunchy when chewwing them straight
Wine is not halal don't drink it pls
Everything you post looks so damn good
What does lobster taste like 💀
Can you do baking???
Yumm
the water from brown coconuts is bad
I don’t understand... why the coconut though?!
I didn't know airrack could cook lol
Erbs???? Herbs
Pls dont drink coconut water from these kinds of coconut, its months old.  Buy one that still has a fresh greenish husk
Max the aesthetic meat guy ❤️
that is a  wrong way to open a coconut
He didn’t slap the lobster
This mans heat is more than arbys meat
Do you remember this if u do your a og "NO soup for you!
At the start: looking good. Puts the bisque in a coconut: no
If you want a BANGER of a grilled cheese, try cooper sharp cheddar, its godlike imo
Oh damn...
