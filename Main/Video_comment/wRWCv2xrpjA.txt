Quietest 50 I’ve ever seen. No one does it like goat
I used to pray for times like these
0:19 see that wouldn’t have happened to kobe
I hate the modern nba jerseys so much.
LeBron james🐐🐐
Lebron is more than an athlete
RIGGED GAME NO WAY WIZARDS GOT 20 MORE FOULS CALLED LMAO YOURE TELLING ME ABVDIA GOT MORE FOULS THEM BRON OF BROOK?? LMFAO. FUCK NBA CONSPIRING AGAINST LAKERS. CHECK BOX STATS 😂😂 RIGGED
Can't even win 2 games in a row.  Love it!!!!
Jordan  the goat deal with it Lebronites!
lebron blm kamala harris hunt errday ccp james
of course I get an ad at 1:09
That was a good game
The games was over in the first 5 minutes and Lebron plays 40 minutes , not to win the game but to pad his score! What a buncha clowns and what a useless coach !
https://youtu.be/8JjGry2v51I
Don’t get excited cause this bum ass team won only one game They still trash
He can only play against sorry teams😭
LeBron has the most unselfish game; this man is over *10,000* in both rebounds and assists, but can easily give you a 40 piece each night if he chose to. 😳💪🏾✊🏾
The.King lebron james..
Where are the haters huh???...
Bobo
What a waste of money AD for not playing .
I noticed erytime they throw an ol school song on lbj23 perform gd an always make the shot...if you watch what...I noticed during the game...u see what I'm talking bout
Lakers All The Way!
Booker staring down lebron wife as he cook lebron 😂 lebron not dancing tonight
I think this is what everyone expected from the lakers. Good for them.
Watching the Lakers suns game. The Lakers tapped out. Game over after first quarter.
Keep praising lebron and the Lakers everytime they win one out of 6 games. The lakers are garbage. This coming from a lakers fan. Yall new generation quick to call lebron the goat because he had a couple high scoring games. The lakers are still disappointing.
Nobody: Stu Lantz: ANOTHER NICKELLLLL!
Bro was straight flicking that shit. Kobe mode.
talen was on kuz all game lmao
If Lebron has to score 50 for the Lakers to win against the Wizards, you got probs.
Westbrook does it again he's my brick mvp
Good morning NBA
Unstoppable
Respect this man Lebron!
WHy isn't Rui playing more?  Get Kispert and KCP off the floor. They provide no offense for the team on their own. Rui can at least get his own shot. C'mon man the season is lost Let him and Deni get some run.
i think lebron is on a planet on hus own
At this point we cannot keep saying MJ was better.  At least just say they are just as good.
The only reason why Lebron doesn't have 6 championship or more, is because he is often playing  with not so great teammates.  In spite of that he often makes it to the finals or playoff.
HE IS THE GOAT
Give THT a raise, wow!  Monk, Reaves - Strong backups.  Then of course Lebron with those impossible fadeaways!
While it has been years since the Lakers traded both Clarkson and Hart in their bid to create a championship team, some are still thinking about “what if” the Purple and Gold chose to develop their youngsters that also include Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Kyle Kuzma and Julius Randle. While the counter-argument in the idea is the likelihood that LA wouldn’t have the 2020 NBA Championship, some would say that at least they would have a future. BLAME OWNER GENERAL MANAGER LEBRON JAMES ...STICK WITH YOUR PLAYERS LET THEM GET CHAMPIONSHIP CHEMISTRY WHY  TRADE TO MAKE A SUPER TEAM FULL OF EGOS  AND LOOSE THE CHEMISTRY  GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS  END OF STORY
Lebron make ball go into hoop for point very good.
56 points so what. james was playing against team in ranking with similar low ranking. Plus who was covering him? The Wizards almost beat the Lakers. Washington Wizards are the one of worst team in the NBA that more than likely won't make the playoffs. That is the real headline, and what does that tell you about the Lakers then.
Anthony Davis needs to get his ass healthy and stop getting hurt he is made of glass
Yea!
It's the King bitch 🏀 #Lbj
50 points not hard when your the only one shooting the ball lol
nah..when they winning games he always show sportmanship but when they lose nah forget it..crybaby lebron walking out to the locker room..hope they can still make it to the play in..😂😂😂
Still missing our boy. Kuzma!
Kuzma trying to make lebron regret trading him😂

Kuz was getting burnt up in that 3rd & 4th 😂😂
Bench WB. and will laker wins.
Bron gone have to drop 50 every win we get it seems
LBJ is a bad man 😮‍💨
LeBron x Kuz 🥺
Damn I feel bad lebron jumping for tipoff
what a game for LBJ
Thats what happens when you let Kuzma defend James.  He's his disciple, his padawan.  He ain't gonna rough his master.
This dude Lebron's got game. It's ridiculous he is doing this at his age. G.O.A.T status 🔥
Ice in his veins. Cold 🥶
Lebron is not a real Laker he is a Cleveland cavalier
Lakers sucks lebron James anit no 🐐 Jordan will always be the 🐐
Kuz and KCP are Lakers 4L
Kuz & KCP
Those LeBron Fadeaways were sick
When I think back to how great LeBron has been over the years with the love hate relationship people have with him just wanted to give LeBron his Flowers you know the talk of Goat or greatest of all time I's cool but LeBron is well seasoned can play all postion and has adapted his game to the game he loves so much. That being said wish other guys had that same mamba mentality that LeBron and Kobe has guys that special are why you say Top 3 MJ Kobe LeBron it's that will to be better and of course getting a W and a chance to compete for a championship but man seriously my hat goes out to LeBron staying in shape keeping the game we all love entertaining putting on a show like so many greats before him since 18 now 37 incredible the under dog from Cleveland now the Big Dawg on stage  just wish Kobe and gigi and the people on that plane were here to see greatness Rip Kobe Mamba Mentality Forever
such a shame that kuz couldn't handle the la pressure, he is balling out now that he is with the wizards compared to when he was with the lakers
what did westbrook do??  still a burden to LBJ  lol at age  of 37  LBJ is still carrying a team shame  on  rus
THT crosses KCP then posterize KUZ
He's so tired of losing he's just like fuck it I'll do it myself
Can't wait for Lebron to retire. He's the worst thing to ever happen to basketball.
people disagree when i said lbj is the greatest passer of all time. the reason-->Hes nearing 10k assist and he aint even a point guard for God sake.  He knows when to pass and how to pass it, then swish.  if u dont agree.better watch again.
Lebron so happy, you can see him flexing. He dont care about this team, so long as individually he put up the stats. Thats what you get when you try to compensate for lack of championships
Did anyone notice that fade-away mid-range jumper-pass … like who does that
Not them putting a ad right before LeBron’s dunk 😭
So... Center, huh?
Malik monk 💪🏻
Support our lakers don’t bash them when they lose and stop with the goddamn death threats you crazy motherfuckers are shaming the game shame on y’all grow the fuck up! #lakers fan since I was born! Facts!
First foremost die hard laker fan since I was born and I don’t appreciate crazy ass fans threatening players family it’s not that serious grow the fuck up so with that being I support Russell Westbrook the lakers have not been fully healthy since they won the chip stop bandwagoning it and be a real fucking fan support them through the trenches not just win they 🏆 # facts # real talk!!!
Will miss you kuzma coulda used you this year no doubt
Wtf happen to porzingis
I hate Lebron but he’s definitely one the most gifted athletes of all time. Absolute Fucking specimen.
THT dunked on Kuz! & Taunted him after his assist to Lebron for that 50 piece McNuggets 🤣
they win more without AD.
LeBron schooling lil Kyle
Shame on youall Bron haters
Lebron dunked so hard that YouTube went to a AD hell nah
Lebron is like a fine wine, get better with age!
Westbrook need to bench for rest of season!  He miss a lot of buckets n made a lot of bad decisions.
kuz played well too haha
This don't make no damn since get that nigga Westbrook and the other bums up out of there!! they should be a damn shame of themselves...for forcing a 37 year old to get 50 points to win a game... LeBron don't deserve this...it pisses me off his star teammates are ass
So it takes Lebron scoring 50 to beat the Wizards. The Wizards…
It’s never truly a laker game without the signature LeFuckYou 3
how can u hate leberon ?
1 game win streak King ✊🏿😂🤦🏿‍♂️
19:19 THT yelling in Kuzma’s face was 🔥😩!!!
Lakers Record let’s not forget 👀😂,
Funny how LeBron & the lakers can’t go all out against teams like the Clippers , Spurs , Dallas , Bucks , suns, top teams , 😅
Now why didn't lebron play like this in Houston?
LB leads the NBA in scoring (tied with Embid and Giannis at 29.0 per game).
King LeBron James 👑👑👑👑👑👑 best NBA player king
bron thankyou for the greatness we had witness
How awesome this 5 could be if coach makes the right subs....
Give it to the man. He was SOLID in this game. 🏀
Man!!!! I have been a LeBron Die hard fan for years... and to witness such greatness in this life time once again just like the Jordan Era is just amazing. I promise and mark my words when LeBron retires that will not be the last of the James LEGACY because I can promise you Bronny is gonna be just as good if not better. 🙏🏾🙏🏾 I am truly blessed to have been alive to see LeBron and can't wait for such awesome things that his son will continue in the future NBA. 💪🏾💯
50 piece dropped on Kuz head 🤣
You cant guard leBron
Can only Beat the teams at the bottom what a bunch of clowns
I think lebron could play like this intill he's about 42 or 43
Grabe ka lebron james💪🔥🏀
Congrats to LA nation for defeating the "World Beater" Washington Wizards,team. One game winning streak is back!, LMAO.
Buzzcut LeBron different.
lebron is just showing his former boys that he's not retiring soon.
LeSimmons : WE'RE NOT GOING TO THE PLAYOFFS LAKERS FANSSSS !!! *BOBBLING HEAD / SHOULDER SHAKE*
If he can do it in year 19 he can do it in year 20 with Bronny
Lebron is absolutely incredible
old man lost a little bit of his bounce. but still an unstopable force out there.
As expected he will score against the bottom team to make his stat looks good for himself. Even they are out of the playoffs. He is so happy arrogant bitch! Nba and Lebronoids must be celebrating now for their baby james hahaha! GROAT!!
Bro it’s the wizard’s and Beal not on the court. Like really look at the defense, I mean the wait around. Of course he gone get 50, I’m surprised it wasn’t more but he wanna pass the ball.
Ah They gave Kumza azz the business all that talkin
I miss Kobe dam this laker team of 2022 tbh💯
King James always been on top with class.
BOOOO! Lol
Russ and james combined 55 pts what a duo
That’s THT Slam Tho 😮‍💨🔥💯
CARMELO THE CURSE ANTHONY HAHAHAHA RETIRE DUDE
Who got Venmo
Kuzma got destroyed 😭😂
Check this out: @Anthony Davis https://youtu.be/SbA0iu-U5b0
This is the LeBron we've been looking for the past few month
The lakers won’t make the playoffs but if they do they will get a beat down Father Time has queen James time
If the Lakers want to make one last push, give LeBron the ball and gtfo way. Unfortunately, he really is hesitant to take late game shots like that game against Houston. Lakers really don't have anything except LeBron. They should trade everyone including AD. For Russ, I'm sure he'll have his own way of walking out. Sad to say that even Melo also needs to be kicked out.
Just when I start to give up on this team LeBron makes me believe Hennything's possible!
And when they talk about scorer, they don't mention lebron, smh
8:05 THT holy shit 😤
Another 50 ball 🔥
I bet if Lebrons contact wasn't so big, they could afford to pick up some quality pieces to surround him
50!
The Goat simple
Y’all fuckers really missed the logo 3 from Lebron wowww
It’s time for LA to catch 🔥before the playoffs‼️
LBJ is the goat of this generation period
Bro they just gave me an ad right before Lebron flushed the dunk mid air 😐
Lebron is amazing man wow
lebron at center is crazy
What did legoat said..."sorry i traded you all"😀😀😀
Anybody notice Stanley Johnson like “tip-off” / pre game ritual
As a solid fan from ph so much appreciate every game you play bron. LBJ forever. 💪💪
For the Lakers to Win Lebron have to score 50. Give that old man a break
Looking forward LaLakers , Lebron & Westbrook could still make it to PlayOffs. Miami Heat Fan 🔥🔥🔥
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. All you have to do is believe in him and you will be saved. ❤
Lebron future of the nba fr
Bulok nmn putol yung sa logo
Nice idol james
The game that I Will never forget when lebron beat the 73 wins golden State warriors and won the championship and now at 37 years old 56 and 50 points . Kevin Durant  try to beat the golden State warriors those days     but Steph curry was too good and he joined them
They need to get rid of Westbrook. He brings bad luck to the Lakers.
I can't wait for Shannon's take and this, and for Skip to just blow it off that LeBron had 2 50 piece games in a week.
W/o lebron wnba can defeat lakers
Lakers all the way
LeBron wanting Westbrook definitely top 3 worst career decisions
Skip Bayless call sick because Shannon was waiting for him at the studio he wants to cooked skip Bayless  . Bron is in the house
He have a chance to win the scoring title at 37 years old is lebron from another planet
Cleveland has a better record than Lakers!  Haha!
Him and harden can score against the weak teams in the nba !
Lebron 56 points and 50 points in the same week at 37 years old and he makes it looks so easy skip Bayless and those haters please keep your mouth shut .the king is in the house
Problem for russ is that he has never been considered anything more than athletic and hard working. He has always had high turnovers, but with his athleticism fading by the day, his turnovers look even worse without the accompanied triple double.
stats of WB this game? lmao Lbj gooin out next game coz he hurt his shoulders for carrying WB too much.
Lebron has to get 50+ pts to win, not sustainable in playoffs, hes a great player but he gets tired too just like the finals game in Cavs.
The king is out of this world playing like he is 18 years old.l won't be surprised if he score more 50 points games and win the scoring title the king is the greatest
Hanging 50 on the wizards an its like that, The Wizards lol really? Lebum is a girl... always tryin to take credit when it's good and no accountability when the bum ass team gets whooped ....because of his ass.  Who give a shit if you score 50, what a joke. The wizards lol.
Nobody comes close to the king of basketball . Bron numbers will do the talking facts please
Jordan who... Kobe who ... Durant who...king James is in the house playing like he is 18 years old ..just compare his numbers with any other players  facts of the NBA
Even when Russ scores it looks like a struggle
King James is playing like he is 18 years old 56 points and 50 points haters and Skip Bayless  lebron James is the Best if he wants to score he is a unstoppable Force ..LeBron numbers are better than Jordan and Durant . Facts of the NBA
How is Lebron real 😭😭😭😭
The only reason LeBron won is because the ex lakers let him win
My goodness Old Man King James😮 still battling Father Time
Appreciate greatness
Wenyon was a huge pick up. Real effort my god . I forgot what that looked like
5:10 whoever edits these needs a demotion…like SHOW the play instead of just Lebrons reaction and the start of the next play…
Now I believe about the conspiracy that Lebron was actually 10 years younger than his current age.
Keith king
Rams weak af just like these girls
Do the editor's of this video even review their work?? Terrible! They cut off one of LeBron's logo 3's that got the crowd super excited! REVIEW YOUR WORK, INTERNS!!
That's how the Lakers should be looking. Westbrook was okay on defense but if his offense clicking. They are a problem. Coming from a 76er fan.
Wowwwww
This highlight doesn’t have a the 70th point three pointer from between the logo and the three point line seems like a prretty important shot to omit from the highlight reel
Wow! Didn't see that comin
GOAT
🐐
Lebron and his young core is such a better combination than Lebron with his old heads
Shout out to THT and Malik Monk and Austin. Keep playing hard and getting those buckets when you get the ball. You see what beastmode LeBron is in right now. But You can trust them to score a bucket for you.
😱 Oh my hoodness !!!
2 50 points performances in 3 games? At age 37? Tf😅 Bron is built different
GOAT!
This dude bron needs help he damn near do this shit all by himself
whats wrong with Kendrick Nunn again?
LeBron always said; at the beginning of the season he has to get going so that, with no major injuries and this time late in season he is in shape like  29 year old bron
Bald Lebron is goat status
Westbrook. Let's go!! It's time for us to try to get in the playoffs. We don't care about your stats. You are going to be key for us to get a championship. And I can't wait for AD to get back. Melo let's go. You missed that mid range shot. Supposed to be automatic baby. Let's get to the playoffs and make noise.
Austin Reaves like, “can i get game ball for Bron?”
Lebron made sure he didn’t lose to Kuz
james skill set has gotten so much better wow you can see it, amazing what this guy can do.
THT spin and slam was clean
I appreciate his greatness! One of a kind talent. LeBron never really suffered serious/career ending injury so at 37 he is still balling. Though stats is good but not as better as winning championship rings since the competition is about winning championship and not personal stats. I hope he will win another ring. The league is been soft, fast-pace, 3pt era the last 10 or 13yrs now. Players been stats padding... but winning matters more than anything. Anyway, Who is the GOAT is nothing but personal opinion so my GOAT list is #1 MJ
Goodluck making the playoffs lakers. While everyone said theyd win a ring this year. Credit to lebron for still bulldozing tho
The spin the slam, the spin and the slam for tht. Lakers commentators are annoying
God I wish the Lakers would play like this all the time
In 3rd quarter I knew for sure it’s over here with I hope one day to catch one of his game before he retires
Those slam dunks are 🤩
I’m
LJ looked like he was on coffee.
Salty ass bulls and Jordan fans literally sit here and watch laker highlights just to cry about lebron incredible to see grown men in their 40-50s doing this lmaoo.
We Gon skip that shot fake
He needs a playoff chance..
I  believe that this might have been a bit personal.
How y’all just gon skip the logo 3 play ?
You gotta foul guys about to get an easy dunk.
Omfg LBJ
Kuzma got abused
Your Jealousy ONLY👉🏿ADD FUEL TO LEGOAT JAMES 🗣FIIRRREEEEEEE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪🏿💪🏿🙌🏿💯
The greatness of Lebron!
Yeeup
Another 50 bomb at 37? Jordan could never. At this point if you still don’t think LBJ is the Goat you a blatant hater. No other player in the history of basketball has done what he is doing right now. The nba is going to be at a huge decline when he retires.
Another level... the king gets wiser.
Hi
Awesome
Savor this moment. There will be no one like him 👑
This is a new year...why some people still hate this man....why....tell me something....this man came out of high school and straight to the NBA....stop comparing him and mj....both of them is a goat....he is 37 in his 19th year...still breaking records...respect what he is doing
There goes goat man …
https://youtu.be/op4gBmaKpXY WATCH
One of the greatest to play the game, LBJ 🏀
Father times got his hands full 😤😤
La is 9th west seed. You couldn't beat the rockets 15 West seed at their home game so you beat the wizards that's 11th in the east at home you think that's a playoff or NBA news and have a parade. Who raised you la fans. You la fans are simps and beta. Who raised you. I'm sorry your mama did. Keep drinking that Kool-Aid cuz you'll never see the playoffs. All of y'all punch drunk.
The goat. There’s no debate.
Russ looks empty tonight, He's not just enjoying it anymore, I feel so bad for him, We still have your back brodie!!
Lebron is doing something completely unprecedented in NBA history, pushing the outer limits of the definition of sustained excellence. I really don't see how you could continue to minimize or detract from his greatness at this point. I have him at number 2 all time and I don't see how anyone could reasonably place him any lower than 3rd.
5:11 yall skipped the highlight GOOFY 🤦‍♂️
Unbelievable,  they way the Wizards stopped playing defense at the end of this game. WTF
Just for reference, Jordan at 37 was putting up 20 points per game on 44% shooting. LeBron on the other hand is dropping 29 points per game, making him the leading scorer, on 51% shooting. We need to stop hating on LeBron so much, we need to actually compare him to Jordan, instead of just saying Jordans better. LeBron is statistically a better player than Michael Jordan, and everyone knows stats don't lie.
Why it always seem like Lebron plays the standings. It’s no doubt that Russ ain’t on one but HTH and Monk proved he’s not needed. I swear if they get the play in and win I’ll be so mad. This is our year.
Lol I like how Kuzma girlfriend got front row seats to watch his ass get dusted by Bron😂😂😂
Great game for the king 👑 🐐
Coach Vogel to bring Lakers to the Playoffs with young core around LBJ and start a Winning Streak…  Starting FIVE/Closing Line-up in the 4th Quarter: Center-Wenyen Gabriel, PF-LBJ, SF-THT, SG-Monk, and PG-Reaves. Four young athletic full of effort hustling young core players around LBJ.  2nd Unit:  Center-Howard, PF-Melo, SF-Johnson, SG-Westbrook, and PG-Augustine. Westbrook now the Sixth Man of the Lakers to head the 2nd Unit.  3rd Stringers: PF/SF-Ariza, SF/SG-Bazemore, SG-Bradley, Ellington.  Injury List: AD and Nunn.
2:58 sheesh
Kuz couldnt hit a wide open layup on the lakers and now putting up these shots
Its pretty unbelievable to me he was having fun all game tbh I think this is the game where he took the most heat check shots that all went in amazing that last fg was no net
Lebron better than Jordan now
Think about this - anyone 25 and younger can probably NOT remember a time where Lebron James wasn't the most dominant player in the NBA.  Think about how many stars came after Lebron, and have already faded away before him.
They should’ve kept Demarcus cousins when they had him
Yo this is crazy to think they look like that with the guys that wasn't really playing all year
Who wants to guess how many years he has before he calls it quits?
Great to see these fade always remind me of my city Lebronto nights 🔥🔥
lebron james baby
Those off line fade aways by Lebron are insane...
this nba editor is so fucking trash lmao how do you only include 2 out of 6 of lebrons threes @nba get a different editor no way y’all actually be paying this dude
What happened at 5:12 did cameraman forgot to point towards the court?
Please keep on doing that same shit 🥰🤩
cutting out lebron highlights, what a shit editor
Lebron is hope     Lehope
What will Skip Ballslees has to say now
I watched the whole game west brick was 1/9 from the field he’s ass bro
Lebron James: Your favorite basketball players favorite basketball player.   Name any one thing on this earth that gets better with age. Lebrons aged better then all of them.   The man's LeBenjamin Button!!
Remember this, you're gonna miss this man when he's gone. Love always King James.
A lot of people hated Kobe and took him for granted before he retired and passed away. I hope yall dont make the same mistake with Lebron before he stops playing in the NBA because we will never see anything like this ever again
Bron and Ar 15 killing this year
Nice big game winner shot for the Los Angeles Lakers win the game against Washington wizards 🧙‍♀️ in Los Angeles California 😎😎😎😎😎😀😀😀😄😄😄😄😁😁😁😁😁🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀⛹️‍♀️⛹️‍♀️⛹️‍♀️⛹️‍♀️⛹️‍♀️⛹️‍♀️⛹️‍♀️⛹🏻‍♂️⛹🏻‍♂️⛹🏻‍♂️⛹🏻‍♂️⛹🏻‍♂️⛹🏻‍♂️⛹🏻‍♂️⛹🏻⛹🏻⛹🏻⛹🏻⛹🏻⛹🏻‍♂️⛹🏻‍♂️⛹🏻‍♂️⛹🏻‍♂️⛹️‍♀️⛹️‍♀️⛹️‍♀️⛹️‍♀️⛹️‍♀️
Lebron is actually android 6 of the red ribbon army
Fuckin 🐐
Ballin at 19 years old and now ballin at YEAR 19
This was the first NBA game i’ve ever been to and LeBron did something he’s only done 13 other times in his career, that’s a pretty big flex ngl.  Oh, and the Lakers are now 1-0 when i’m in attendance btw
Ain't Over Til It's Over.  LeBron James still the best player on the planet.
Bron looks taller 😆😆🥇🥇🥇Strive for greatness ❤️
I want my pink metallic Porshe back 50 cents
I want my pink metallic Porshe back 50 cents
Lakers had to rock they “Wizards logo color scheme” uniforms huh
Just here to read the bronsexuals comments. 👀🧐🥶😆😂🤣😭💀
It funny how Ppl were complaining a game ago that Lebron wouldn’t take final shot… He passed to Melo for the 3, the game was tied…. But He just showed that he can score when needed, the Boy is a Human Legend. Let that sink in
Lakers underdog champion ?
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates ~ 🎈
https://youtu.be/oH9w8C8pXMs.....
King James nough said¡!¡!¡!
Still proud. Reason last team to be eliminated from the NBA playoffs. 😬
LBJ needs to put up 50the rest of the season
Lebron is amazing
i like lbj but a 50 point game against wizards is not impressive. If he does that against other better teams then it is worth noting
WAY TO GO LAKERS
We still talking about Jordan huh
Washington Wizards 109 Los Angeles Lakers 122

First foul lebron james first team foul
People wanna see the lebron vs Jordan buried ..I'm not so sure if it'll ever be buried if lebron keeps playing this way at 37.
Awesome Lebron......
Now it’s time for them to lose 4 in a row
LAL LBJ OMG!!! 😳
LeBron is old. Take him out sooner. He’s the only player that’s helping them win games, try to preserve him
5:39 lebron james steal nice shot slam
Video wasn't edited great. I wanted to see that logo shot 🙄
Bibigo Los Angeles Lakers I love this game
For three points make it basket lebron james
Austin Reeves 🔥
Goat James as always
that tht scream on kuz's face after bron's 3 tho
So question... If LeBron and the Lakers end the year 37-45 (a very likely scenario seeing how they're 29-37 now and realistically may end 8-8 over last 16 games), will this help or hurt his legacy? Because when 38 year old Jordan played for the Wizards and they ended the year 37-45 with Jordan in the 60 games he played averaging 22-5-5 after 3 years gone this was seen as a stain on his goat canvas. I'm just wondering if this will have the same impact if we're calling it fairly.
Is that DaBaby wearing a crown with a Kobe👑 2️⃣4️⃣ jersey?  Did Monk step out of bounds @9:08?
I appreciate everything you’ve done for the game Lebron and glad your still playing in da League all these years
Bronsexuals having orgasm off his 50 but didn't say a word about his choke game against rockets 😂😂😂
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X6v42yZ4ps&t=843s
I see they missed the 5:11 highlight. Oops!🤭
Mj is GOAT Kobe is GOAT LeBron is GOAT
Enjoy your L Kyle Kuzma. I take it that move to the wizards was really helpful to your new team. Lebron shit on the entire Washington bad team lol
So obvious kuzma was paid to lose this game lmfao
in order to have winning streak lakers must limit westbrook on the floor especially on the 4th qrt if the game is close they have better chance on winning games
Can believe lebron still scoring 50
The LBJ to AR15 pick and roll is pretty deadly
Thank God Westbrook was there... without him you would have only won by 8pt! 🤣
As a warriors fan before the first modern ring or KD, I can honestly say lebron is my goat, to still be this great at this age is unheard of imagine if u put lebron in any contending team they would be champion favorites and at 37
KP back to being ass i see
When I went to that game, it was crazy. We can all appreciate Lebron scoring 50 pt. Kanye was there also.
@lakers Westbrook definitely needs to be traded playing 30 plus minutes and only 5 points.
lebron putting up a 50 piece at 37, incredible
Great game by lerbon!!  Sometimes you got to do that especially if people are calling you the second greatest of all time.. you got to do the job yourself no excuses no blaming teammates NO EXCUSE JUST RESULTS I expect you to get the job done 😎
Kuzma didn’t block LeBron because he wants to get signed back to the Lakers 😂😂😂😂😂🤦🏾‍♂️
I think lebron better of with younger team  cause there fingers so much better with Dwight Howard DeAndre Jordan Russell Westbrook Carmelo Anthony
how does it feel for the LAKERS not making it to the playoff for the first time ?
Lebron is the mf goat idc.
LeBron fans are weird
Whenever he goes full bald. That’s when he unlocks his inner Thanos.
Friends I want 1.3M views in half an hour so please share this videos to your friends and relatives and ask him to watch this please guys help me
Use some celebration energy and play some defense.
Pure GOATness lol Like just look at this nigga bruh at 37 . Lol basketball ain’t gone be the same when he gone and the Bron haters gone feel it 😂
When he decides to take it to the rim with power he cannot be stopped. You saw on the 2 on 1 he said I'll bounce this to monk oh no I'll actually just keep it myself and throw it down. Then against 2 defenders he spins and finished through contact And 1. They need him to play bully ball and score big. Of his body can hold up he can do it and they can go on a run.
When AD coming back?! Bron need to do all that to win convincingly
And the lakers talking options to trade Lebron James! Haa You Fools!
If Lebron had a decent team he would go to the finals this man is not human
It jus don’t make sense how does Bron keep doin this at this age it’s unreal🤯🤯🤯
THT looking like he's finding his rhythm again man is ballin.
It's the wizards with kuz being there big player maker  I'll take the win  Cuz we need it but we have to keep the energy up  Definitely losing yo sum booty teams ain't it  Decent win but dont show out take the win and dip it's the wizards
It's easy to score if nobody is guarding you
I don't give a fuck if he score a 100 I still hate that nigga don't matter what fuck him
The only player with multiple 50+ point games pass the age of 37. The league won't be the same once he finally hangs it up smh
50 piece wing dinner hold the biscuits
This is rare form lebron this is "i want another championship" lebron
I can’t stand Anthony Davis. Why is it that a 40 year old man can stay healthy and put up numbers consistently but he can’t???
ThT with the dunk tho sheesh
🐐🐐🐐
Congratulations Lebron on a 50 piece on the Wizards
Tht looked nice this game
I'm no Lebron fan but when LBJ calls it quits, the NBA won't be as exciting as of now. Salute to the GOAT that i hate. my GOAT is still Jordan, but i respect lebron as one of the best.
I can appreciate LeBron's level of greatness, I can't appreciate him giving up on the season, and his teammates (that he hand-picked), to focus on personal accolades. He Couldn't make it more obvious
Can we just appreciate Austin Reaves who has been very reliable in cutting and setting up pick and roll? He is just great
This game had LeFuck you written all over it.
Let’s go lakers.
How does a 37 year old get 56 points and 50 points LeBron is Literally THE G.O.A.T.
🔥
Probo
Its sad to see lebron carry so fucking hard, and still not even win by that much agains the damn wizards. Really wish they had a better team or he got the fuck out of LA
BWENAS KAY SI ANGKOL
Lakers won a game again and now hopes of winning the championship has been revived! 😅
I hate being a Washington fan
He'll drop 50 at 50
Lakers are still 8 games below .500 so lets not act like one great game from Lebron and all of a sudden the Lakers are back. They still aren't gonna be doing jack shit this year. 100% gonna be in the play in seeing how they are 13.5 games back of the 6th seed. Clippers despite missing there 2 star players all year are somehow still better. Which means LA is probably gonna have to win 2 games in a row just to make it to the playoffs which is something they literally haven't done in over 60 days. Lucky they are in the west as they probably wouldn't even make the play in the East.
Goat no doubt
just here to comment. THE FAKERS WON A GAME.... Yes, the fakers beat the 5th worst team in the NBA to finally win a game.. ill bet they celebrated at lawhiner divas house over hotdogs, chips, and cheap beer... 😜🤪😝
Greatness
Krazy takes Lebron James to score 40+ for the lakers to win if he does this with AD in the playoff they could have a chance. If AD healthy
Just hate how everybody just stands at the three line waiting they need to move around
Lebron is one of the all time greats,  but let's be real kobe was pledged with injuries last kobe of years. And jordan had back problems towards the end. Lebron has been blessed with no major injuries
Lebron 37 and in shape. So in this weak league with no defense and 19 year olds. It's no surprise what he doing. In the 90s a young Kobe came off the bench.
He can score 100 a game it doesn’t lol
Prime longevity makes lebron the greatest of all time. Period. No stats no drama. Just pure greatness.
Who knew Kyle kuzma would become a better fit not in lakers
Lakers > Clippers
Come on man this man 37 stop tryna diminish this man legacy 💪🏿💯

Good match
One of the best
Lebron Son’d everyone on that team. Washington worse than the lakers practice squad. Btw prozingus is a baby B!tch.
🔥
Lebron should always keep his haircut that length
Even if the Lakers miss the playoffs, I’ll remember how great LeBron still is in Year 19.
He scored 50&56 points. guess what?!!.. he starting at a center position how TF is that happen! might be 27yrsold. Truly he is 😅 👑
Go Lakers 🏀🏀🏀
Im a jazz fan and now I’m a laker fan too!
Washington plays JV defense at best
Will Nunn (bone bruise) ever play this season? Will the Lakers keep him for next season? Is Nunn even a good player?
im liking comments about lebron 🔥🇵🇭
I bet he finna sit out next game.
So lebron dropped 2 50 pieces for them to win!
LBJ was a cheat code, i don't know when he's prime years will end, the "you cannot beat father time" quote didn't age well. Damn, 2 games with 50pts in a week is insane, we can't see another 37yr old beast like him again. Appreciate while he's playing. This was another silencer for his haters
The new trinity is Kobe, Bron, KD. MJ, Bird, and Magic get yall old ass on...those 3 would kill the old trinity.
What a player GOAT🐐
#beyond human
#like
#come fast imagine
Before It's Over , Everyone Will Know The Chosen 1!!
Virtuoso
He just entered his 6th prime .. this lebron is different
Bron : “Fine, I’ll do that t myself.”
Beast mode LBJ....
where is AD???????
Bron in POINT-CENTER then drop 50 points? damn true greatness..
Winning basketball happens when Westbrick is on the bench
Man’s is screaming like that after beating the wizards LMAO
The lakers are garbage...takes 50 from bron to barely beat the fucking wizards. Yeah, we're done..
NBA INBOUND IS FCKED UP LOOK AT THEM FEET REF! COME ON..
So I guess Bron gotta score 50 in order for us to win smh!! Shit, fuck it get the scoring title then!!
LBJ showing that greatness
Seems the king in space time😅
What a performance by the big 2! Lebron and Westbrook combined for 55 pts
At 2:38 they just let Bron just come in like the red Sea was parting.    #NO DEFENSE#
Lebron too legendary
look at bron showing sportsmanship after the game.
Wow
Hahahahahah
Wow 👌  great job bronny you scored 50 against the wizards 👏 lebum and the lakers are a joke !
After all the crap Kuzma has been talking. It is nice to see a slice of humble pie being delivered to him.
Man if they could get Kendrick Nunn and AD back they might have a chance to make a little noise. They need another consistent scorer bad.
Can’t wait for flights reaction😭
Watching Westbrook get outplayed by his teamates that don't make anywhere near the 40 mil is sad. Just feels bad watching Westbrook struggle.
https://youtu.be/4wgLb8bG1-k
HRT HGH Bron
This baby soft league... No wonder he's doing it in a league where most teams have no identity. The NBA is trash no matter what these paid commentators for ratings say LeBum wouldn't have done none of this years ago....smh #DontTakeThePill #MakeTricks
Never seen LeBron have 50 point games this close to one another. Took his scoring game to the next level this year.
Da goat!!!!
LeBron really gonna will this team to the playoffs. Like he always does. Idk why Davis can’t set that same example, he’s a quitter when shit gets tough.
Westbrook should seat down
50 pc chicken dinner with a biscuit
Finally!!! 🙌🏽
It's hard watching the Lakers with how they've been massively underperforming this year. Lebron doesn't have many of these moments left before he's done. It's best to appreciate it while it's happening now.
We shouldn't have traded kcp they said lol!
Great game  Lakers,  and  good  Team work. Always remember,  Team work Is the Dream work!
the future of the nba is in good hands lol
Definitely GOAT of this era
I hope you guys realize we will never see somebody like Lebron again. truly one of the greatest to ever do it, if not the greatest. Lucky to be able to witness him whilst he’s still ballin, not even a lebron meat rider.
The game will miss him when he retires.
Russ is the NBA equivalent to when Jay-Z said "You went from top 5 to not mentioned at all, to your bodyguard's Oochie Wally verse is better than yours".
It's going to be a sad day when LeBron James retires
Yeheyy, another win by Lakers. I hope they could make the cut ... next season, that is.
9:15 Love how tucker screamed in kuzma's face lol
ara gali bron tagal na yan ngayon molang pinakita yong tunay mong. lakas
https://youtu.be/Epiib6m9FBE
Lebron is still great at his age but are we not going to talk about that person making over 40 millions and only had 5 points. SMH. They can pay me a million and I can drop 6.
Lebron is not human
Lakers are so use to losing now when they beat teams like the wizards you’ll swear it’s the playoffs. This team is annoying.   Bron has to score this much bc that roster is inconsistent
Thr fuvcking goat
Kings got it again..
I love how Kuzma actually does something against Lebron and not when he’s on Lebron smh. Fucking Kuzma hate that guy. Now you play better when you aren’t on Lebron’s team? Fucking idiot. Glad Lebron got him back in the 4th to close the game. Payback’s a bitch Kuzma.
MVP Lebron
is this where the ball lovers hangout? im not gay either asking for a friend. you guys think one of those guys will put the ball in a basket? OOOOH BOY I HOPE SO!!! oops i mean im not gay. HOLY COW HE PUT THE BALL IN THE HOLE!!! AGAIN gotta change the sheets after that one.. also IM NOT GAY!
Lebron : age is just a number 👑
sHoUlD ThE lakErS ShuU DoWn LeBrOn???
I love goat James I told everyone he my goat 🐐 I will never change that and I witness his greatness
So lakers wont win if lebron fails to score 50
Is it just me or does Kuzma look bigger?
I damn sure not no lakers fan and...they trash 🤣🤣 But seeing lebron, "the old man" put on performances like this is pretty dope ngl.
Lebrons age is the only thing that makes haters realize his greatness so sad
Greatness
Can we just appreciate greatness LBJ💪💪❤️
1 more FG. Lebron will join jordan and kyrie. With 50+points 75% FG. Deym.
THT Omg! Stepping them skills up.
Has LeBron reached his final form?
I'm gonna tell my kids about this guy
Jordan coukdnt do this at his age.. Lebron still doing it
Why Tf y’all be skipping highlights
The goat
I can be 37 and drop 50 too
Russ scored 5 points, getting paid $40 million, SMH
T.h.t crossed one old teammate in dunked on the other one
Im gonna say it now and I been saying it .I don't think nobody wants to play the Lakers in the playoffs. The level of experience on that team can turn on and lead to a embarrassing upset.it won't technically be embarrassing bcuz they had big expectations,they just happened to have a shitty season which made then underdogs be default but they are capable
LeBron isn’t human
Does Lebron really have to score 50+ for his team to win!? 🤯
That’s why he’s the mf goat. He can do it all. You all saw when he was on the bench in the 4th quarter Russ almost let the wizards come back until lebron came off the bench and said give me the mf rock!
No pressure for LBJ,. just cut, roll, spot up, instant offense..no problem for him dishing his patented passes off the pick and a nice ball movement and player for them..pick in dive and pop love it! Lebron like MJ and Kobe drawing post up plays fade away and deadeye 3pter too good.! When he's open and he had no time to pass give it to him for a thunderous slam! Best game by THT too., plays agressively! 👊👊👊
This man LeBron still playing like he's 27 at age 37, so great to see
That’s my best player ever
Wow  you beat Washington
I love his greatness. But the fact the lakers NEED him to perform like this every single night is just sad
What a goat 🐐🗣‼️
3:00 Bazemore on the bench lol, that's gold.
Once you master the art of shooting u can dominate like this Bron might got 2 good seasons left 😆
Westbrook should have played football with his size and athleticism. Not Football. He miss the boat.
nanalo pala yong ice tubig ko kanina,hehe,, parang tagilid kasi nong 1st half, d na ako nkapanood ng 2nd half, peace yohh, panalo ng ice tubig..hhaha
So another 50...I'm loving nba now... Since no NFL on now
WOW 👑LeBron
Westbrook has never had to “think” before while playing. Has nothing to do with intelligence. I mean as far as second guessing himself. With lebron being the Go to option its  different and its just a hard adjustment
so good and sad to see LeBron had to literally carry this team but great effort overall
Y’all need help with this highlights playlist? Y’all skipping over entire shots.
Lebron doesnt respect Westbrook lol
That floater Lebron hit at 5:30 was the same game winner vs Toronto a couple years ago if you remember
Lebron setting his self up to be GOAT he win this year he's the  🐐
Legot 💪🏽😤💯
idk why the lakers traded Kuzma lol
the king lebron the goat this era
Let us appreciate his final year/s..a legend..he deserves it...he is my top 3 guy in the GOAT ranking...
Lmfao yo who be editing these videos. Y’all missed the whole shot at 5:13
Thank you Lakers for giving us a good game, it doesn't who opps is as long as we play well and win these next games to enter the play in and surprise people
Bron took this personal don't ever call me Ben Simmons & Kuz you can STFU
Lebron stat chasing just chucking up threes once they had a 15+ point lead with no time left in the fourth. Dude is thirsty af for Kareems numbers
wizards got deni rui kp and kuz and bron still getting guarded by kispert
You know Lebron is going to kill your team when he hits a LefuckYou3 from the corner.
50 from King James 🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Big Balla! Shot Calla!
1 game win streak again
Everytime lebron sat down the lakers lost the lead. He is still the reason his team is winning at age 37. If he left the lakers In the beginning of the season, I don’t think they would win 30 games this year
Kuz got gotted
As a lakers fan. It was great to see Kuz be the second best player in the floor last night
🐐🐐🐐
Dropping another Kennedy! All hail The King of Basketball
5:11 WTF! You manage to cut out a deep 3 by Lebron.
Why add the celebration of a huge play you don't have the highlight for? 🤦🏿‍♂️
vogal gonna keep his job just because he gonna sit russ for the  whole 4th quarter lol
I normally don't comment on videos but I gotta say, the Lakers went crazy at the end. Monk started it all at 7:36 Not a Lakers fan but I love seeing entertaining basketball and that was nothing but. It took me like 5 minutes to watch the last 2 minutes because I kept running it back
I don’t u see stand the hate LBJ gets … we are watching history .. let us all just be grateful and enjoy it.
Nice to see LeBron play so well and score 50. "LeBron James,  LeBron James, LeBron James is on fire, We don't need no water.  Let LeBron score. Score LeBron score.
Ok Bald LeBron need to stick around for awhile....man he on fire lately
At this point they don’t need Russell Westbrook, it’s like they just have him to the side kinda like isaiah thomas. The difference is Isaiah accepts the role and plays good.
Unreal performance at this age one of the greatest players all time
Damn THT dunk on Kuzma lmao
We will really miss Lebron when he’s gone. This is a one of a kind of player😔
Lebron defies age. The man is a BEAST!!!!! #King
Instead, the scoreboard is an enhanced setup to last 2 NBA 2Ks.
But still not able to change scoreboard :(
I was wondering about the PA announcer to see if he would change and guess what? Sure enough!
vintage lebron!!! on the other hand, tht needs to play like this all the time. reeves is improving a lot!
NBA 2K22 is SO realistic have u even tried it?
What’s crazy is how after that 56 on GS I said I think he could have multiple 50 pt games like Wilt and whaddayknow I was right. He’ll have more. He’s a winner and wants to be the Greatest to ever Live and he will get what he wants . He’s a Capricorn
It’s Washington
Pronzingas piss me off so much dude 7feet 3 playing like he a guard pathetic
fountain of youth LBJ
#2 ALL TIME
Too bad Davis can't play.
SKIP is definitely going to downplay his performance again 🤣
gonna miss u lebron
Good game by LBJ. Still no faith in this team.  Besides the 1 warriors win, they only show up against sub 500 trams.
Yep, that guy is the problem.
Since no is saying, let me say this ..bron when popping and hot is hotter than any scorer , idc who u say. Man FG is just insane when hot ......50 in 25shots ....wtf ....lot of player scores 50 but takes more shots & fts.... but this man wheewwww .....its treat to the eyes. Respect and enjoy his greatness even if u hate, hate him but i know deep down u saying "damnnnn"
Y’all saw lebron hit that last 3 and THT was talking smack to Kidman😭💀
even Dr Disrespect could score 50 on D Wizards cmom ppl  wake uppppppp
Kuz over there balling
8:07 IN YO FACE!!!!
Yes Sir ✌️🌄
Lebron its playoff mode 🤣💪
50 twice in 4 games come on this man is the 🐐
LeThanos really out here doing it himself. 👏🏻
Why they was beefing with kuzma 😂
Much respect to Lebron 🔥
I am a fan of Porzingis but I don’t think they will keep him. He is just not as good as he was when he played for the knicks. He did absolutely nothing this game. Defense was piss poor. But hats off to Lebron. I thoroughly enjoy watching Austin Reaves play because he look like he don’t belong lol but is actually pretty good
LeBron James's million and a half on fitness around the offseason is paying off too bad Kendrick done hasn't played not even a second this year for the Lakers they would be a playoff team he is very good on defense and stopping the other teams ball handler primary ball handler
is it me or is kuz taller and bigger?
Yeah my mavs won the trade biggest dude on the court and can’t even make a stop against any laker
Le50 is not the problem 💯
2:59 Owwwwwwshiiiiiiiiiiii!!!!!!!
i want to see lbj score 60 point or more like kobe bryant b4 he hang his jersey! to remember him forever for his greatness as nba player! godbless lbj!
How you gone play a ad when Lebron dunk tho
The GOAT does it again
My goodness lebron. You are god of basketball
Let’s not play Westbrook or start him
Another amazing performance by the king.  Two more assists away from 10000.   Appreciate him now,  lebron is a legend!
bro this man is unreal
As a die hard Laker fan it’s sad that Bron gotta try to do this every game in order for my team to win
Monk is the 2nd best player on the lakers no debate
The King made it again! He is old yes but he is young in talent and power! SALUTE TO THE KING!
Fun fact: IF LeBron can score 50 points for the next three games then he'll pass Karl Malone for second all-time career points
Lakers stink!!!
Let’s see him win against the Suns 🏆
Lebron playing like he's all he needs to win.. and I wish that was true.. but without Carmelo, Malik and THT... making buckets as well the Lakers are going to fall... Amazing performance tho..
Lmao. LeChina James typical stat padding and his go to guy Westbrick is on top of his game. 5 points! Lmao
great game by tht tonight!
Anthony Davis is letting Lebron & the Lakers down by not being available during LeBron’s own personal great season
This guy is insane
Lebron is the greatest everrrrr.  It’s sad to know that he’s not gonna get his legitimate homage until he’s long gone into retirement.  Nobody has live up to this man longevity and efficiency for this long n strong.  Man oh man.
Congrats LAKERS 💪💜 and What a Game for Lebron " KING " James hihi at the age of 37 yrs old. Pumupuntos pa ng 50 pts hehe. Wow amazinngggg Performance hehe
The NBA is going to sorely miss Lebron James when he’s gone. Wow
How do you leave out the LeBron deep three sequence from this highlight?!?!
There r trade Lebron takes out there. Ppl will say anything 😂
Grabehhhhhh
Lebron should start wearing “Why Always Me?”
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 this time sit for a week
Another wasted LeBron season, for ring-counting analysis standards
Nba going feel real funny in the next 5 years to the point I don’t even want to think about it 😩 just imagine there will never be staples in the league like Jordan and LeBron again
Legoat 🐐🔥🔥
As a lebron fan i woulda been so proud if the wizards won this
Lebron bring bronny to raptors, the trophies awaits
Editing is horrible on this video
Are they gonna make the playoffs tho 🤔
I just saw 15 adds for one video man wtf yt
russ is good in assist and defense...!!!1
I want to contend for a title, not have some old guy stat padding
LeBron Isn't Human
At 37 Lebron appreciate him
who edited this;how did mess up the logo shot by lebron
Lakers fan: Booed LeBron  LeBron : that's when I took it personal
LeBron is a diva & it’s obvious he’s the one that needs to keep that same energy
Goat Man Goat Man King JAMES 👑🐐
Been a fan of LeBron from day one. This guy is the 🐐 of this Era. The league will never be the same when he finally hangs it up. I don't care about his finals record. He is an all around better team player than Jordan. He can play 1-5 on any given day and to still be able to put up 50 in year 19 is unbelievable. #WashedKing #Year19
30-50 points man these players are giving us a good ass season 🤣🤣🔥
They could only beat. Teams like Washington that’s it
Too bad LeBron needs to go 50 again to win a game. My goodness!🤦🏽‍♂️
Keep on missing those layups and whine & act like a fool,a champ later . And cry more instead of doing what matters. Thats westbrick for u . Whooping 5 points
I hate LeBron. But must admit mf is an incredible athlete. 2 games scoring 50 points at almost 40 yO. Amazing!!👏
Weird. I don't see any LeWashed comments.
You know the team and coach is horrible if you have to score 50 just to have a chance of winning
Damn LEBRON.....save some of this for the PLAYOFFS!!!!.....CAUSE YALL DEF GONNA NEED IT...IF YOU COULD GET WESTBROOK TO GO OFF FOR 30 THE SAME GAME AS YOU DO....YALLD BE GOOD
I like the way Lebron turn around fade away shot in 13 feet, that's a hard shot made by NBA player and thats Lebron, he is impressive.👏👏👏👏👏👏 💪💪💪💪💪
Anybody else see in the last clip tht scream in kuz face after that LeBron 3? Kuz must’ve been talkin shit
44 million salary just to score 5points. Crap Westbrick
easy win without melo and westbrook in 4th....now they get it...
#LetsGoLakers 💜 💛
🔥👑🔥
50 is a great answer to the stupid Simmons comparisons.
Lakers #6 dominated this game = win!
LEBRON CAN DO IT ALL!!!💯🔥
5:12 You serious with this edit?  What do you pay these people $12/hr or something NBA?  Get better.
Very efficient 50 that's the impressive part
bro where are you going
Lebron is the best NBA player.💪💪💪💪💪💪
LeBron James can't score LeBron weak, LeBron that LeBron this, appreciate this guy greatness while his alive..
LeBron has to do way too much just to win 1 game. Lakers are running him into the ground, cutting a year or two off his career.
MJ got 6 rings doe 🤷‍♂️
Kuzma trying to get lebron on one on one on defense and offense. LOL  he thinks he can beat old lebron 🤣🤣🤣
Was never a Lebron fan but man I have to give it to this old head. He is like fine wine the older her gets the better he is.
This win isn’t necessarily good for the lakers because it just shows it takes lebron needing to score 50+ point games in order for them to win
So sad it takes a 37 year old man to drop 50 so we can win
Let’s be real LeBron is doing what all 19 yr vets have done that the number 1 option lose
They'll lose the next game by 20🤣🤣🤷🏾‍♂️. How long we gonna watch this roller coaster of a player and team this year?
Wow the Lakers managed to beat the Wizards lol Bron put up a nice 50, but he acted like every point what is the biggest deal in the world.
8:06 Omg its 2KTHT!
8:06 OMG 2KZ!
IT'S STILL OL'🐐👑JAMES#6 .. FROM 👑LAKERNATION .. WHO'S GOING TO WIN THE SCORING TITLE ..
Why does the coach hate playing Dwight so much? He had zero minutes tonight
LeBron is putting on a show for the world- STAND UP! We may never see a 37 year old put up numbers like this again.  He will have to soak his knees in Epsom Salt for the next three days, but its the only way the Lakers have a shot to make the play in.
Smh Wizards lost this in the 3rd quarter we took our foot off the gas and idk why
Why lebron celebrating like that after buckets they been getting spanked all season. Should stay calm until they get back on track
8:07  wait4it....
Goat
Lebron doesn't cheat the game but he neeeeeeeds to be drug tested immediately 😭😭😭😭😭😭
I can already hear Skip talking bout ‘stat padding’ in the next episode 😂 LBJ🐐🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
@ 1:11 Remember guys Lebrons knee is "injured"......LOL
Two equal teams played
Oh wow Lakers beat a lowly team 😂😂😂
LeBron James From a Kid From Akron Ohio to The GOAT in The NBA IN MY OPINION! I'm sure people will comment "Nooo MJ is The GOAT" yet I said MY OPINION I'm honored to be watching LeBron play and Coach Pop cause I'm 21 and just recently got cable to watch games
Damn
50!!? Damn lbj is a beast!!  Meanwhile, Russ had 5, sigh😳😳🙄😐😐🤔🥱🥱👀🤦
Lebron gets desperate again like he says! He did not let the team lose!
5:26 lebron buzzer beater vs raptors game 3 👑
Lebron haters scared away with this performance. GOAT
Lebron is better at 37 than he was at 27
Did everybody see when Lebron won the game at the end he starting walking  to the other teams bench lmaoooo this guy 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bron heard all the noise about his last game, and proceeded to drop 50 points 😂
Greatest
Lebron is like the 7th grader that beats up on the 4th grader and then yells WHAT?
They skipped his logo 3 at 5:28
Lakers Fan*  winning 1 streak game:  "watch out for us, we are in rythm, the squad will take the ring".  Lossing: Lebum is old, AD is injured, its westbrick faults. "Wait till AD comes back".  Ridiculous!!!! Whenever lakers win 1 game though they celebrate like they win championship, and the sad part is they always lose to trash teams.
Wouuu James is crazy’s 🏆🏆
Bron-Reaves-Monk is a hell of a Big 3.
4rings
LEBRON GAVE THESE CLOWNS 3 quarters of a season to get it together.... get out of the KING WAY 😤 “he wins a championship this year alone, yeah I said it LEBRON will lead this squad to a championship, on his own! Watch”
O' 🐐 James
How this guy is not on a MVP conversation 😡🤦🏻‍♂️
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED OMSIM DILOS SAKALAM LAKERS NATION MATIK ALL THE WAY 🌟 PURPLE N GOLD BOUNCE BACK STRONGER PLAYOFFS MODE ACTIVATED
Lebron just being the brad Beal of the lakers
Wow James galing
LeBron is the the MVP !!!!
Bro was playing 2k
Just wow how can you hate on this guy, i love him and curry
at this point yall cant say shit bout kyle. Even tho they lost that boy was getting buckets!
NBA is boring when the King 👑 retires. Just appreciate his greatness while he's till active.
as a mavs fan i hope lakers can still join the playoffs
Why is Vogel scared to put Westbrook on the bench where he belongs 🤔 😕 😒
That ny idol westbrook
lbj still the best on the planet  witness the greatness   the best player at age of 37  and best shooter in  nba  this tow guys is amazing  #🐐🐐
I love YouTube comments cuz people aren’t trolls 😂😂😂😂 y’all actually appreciate Lebron and don’t say some ridiculous things to minimize what he does
Wizards
And watch him do it again next game
Lebron is on drugs.
What an athlete . Hope All players make it like this. WISH TO ALL PLAYERS IN NBA A HEALTHY WHOLE CAREER SO THAT WE COULD WITNESS MORE LIKE THIS.
reaves, THT, monk being more valuable than inconsistent westbrick
THT, Monk, Reaves, Johnson. Lebron should realise he dont need an all star team. All he need is a young hungry shooter
Lebron need to drug tested or something, I don't think he's human anyways, this dude is from another planet
All that greatness on a bad team
Bron on PEDs btw
Stat padding in his late years i gues
idol Lebron James👑🦁🔥🔥🔥
50 points is incredible but boy does this man need some help offensively from his team mates
Where are the haters?
Appreciate lebron plsss people
Buti nlng nka chamba ang LAKERS hahahaha
I cant imagine when lebrons gone in nba. That would be so boring
Crazy thing is, during Bron late 20s, lot of folks thought he'll retire fast coz they thought his game was based on athleticism. Instead, the dude learned the game and trained: 3 points, fade away and so on.. well ladies and gent: this is how you stayed forever in your prime. Work ethnic.
Jesus loves you
appreciate him while he's still playing . The GOAT. LBJ 👑
Overrated performance
I love how he thinks he is the man for beating the wizard lmao stfu 😂 L J
50 point game tracker  MJ: 31 times in 15 seasons  Lebron: 14 times in 19 seasons
when you to the arena this is what you want to watch, long live the king!!
Way past his prime, and still dropping 50.
Russ man
“People are marveling at Lebron scoring 50 at 37. I scored 50 at 38.” -MJ
I don’t care imma say it Wenyen Gabriel is the blackest man I seen in a while
Miss kuzma and kcp 🥲
Damn kuz got traded then got 50 on his head😂😂that’s tuff
Just simply the Best!The legend LBJ!❤️
What are you doing THT!! 😂😂
THT woke up on the right side of the bed today, that boy feeling different
Dude can literally retire now if he wants and still be the GOAT
LeCarry
Get lebron some real help bro
Lebron seems like he is having so much fun this year regardless of the record . Congratulations on an OUTSTANDING career brother . There will never be NO ONE like you
LeBron showing the king's never stop what a great player at age of 37? It's improving the points contribute for the lakers but still lebron is over use, GOD BLESS
NBA please do better editing ! You guys fuccin sucks at making these highlights but dnt want other ppl to do it
👑👑👑
50 for the GOAT.
Lebron
It's a shame he has to do everything just to get a win they not gone make it he can't do this every night now he gotta take a game off to let his knees heal up
LeBron is beyond human comprehension.
The problem is LeBron needed to do this in order to win      If he got 30 they would have lost by 5, Westbrick is embarrassing himself he better be preparing for veteran minimums after his ridiculous current contract is done
Shebron and his merry band of HOFers Still way under.500  And people say he’s the GOAT?  Please.  MJ at 40 with 4 scrubs did better than this.
Cry and silent again next game against Suns
How many more ants have to sacrifice their legs so Lebron can have hair?
Seem like they only score when Lebron on the court or they struggle 😩lol
LBJ is🔥👑❤️
lbj since day one!!!
If this (Lakers organization doesn't built the right team around lebron James.. no other recruitment would not want to join this (Lakers franchise...
Lets go #Lakershow
Lebron James needs to be around players that wants to win... this Lakers organization is making horrible desicions
Wizards are 24th in defense and 11th in wins in the East.  Ah yes, 50 pts.
2003 was the year he started and I swear he been doing this since day one. DOMINATING
The lakers is not gonna make the playoffs at all period.  Because Lebron james won't be able to have to many high scoring games in order for this team to win.. besides it all, the the lakers got away from this win, because Washington wizards are not a 3 pointer team... which is the only team in the NBA that has a low percentage of 3 points made..
LeBwrong Team
WHY DOES NBA PUT THIS MANY ADS IN A YT VIDEO
GET LEBRON SOME HELP PLEASE!!😭
50 piece Cajun wing LeBron 🔥 🔥 🐐 🐐
Should've been 2 in a row. Good win Lakers, LAbron was poetry in motion on some of those shots. Sheesh.
Lowkey I guess it takes Lebron to score 50 pts to get a Laker Win these Days 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Le50 James
When all is said and done! Lebron will be the Greatest player to ever play the game!;)
Put some damn respect on their names‼️💜💛 #Lakershow
two evenly matched teams, unimpressed
Now all the sudden they love Lebron
Man the Lakers are wasting  👑 James prime!
Yoooo THT Is A Bad Man When He Plays Like That
Lakers beating the who? We know Lakers and Westbrick sucks. 😂 They are what we call COOKED. 😂 sorry to tell you Lakers fan the harsh truth of reality. Lol
LA Lakers VS Former LA Lakers
GREATEST OF ALL TIME
Just lucky
Imagine, NBA without LBJ😔
50 on 18 of 25. Well done LeBron!
Bron the 🐐 forreal
Lebrontosaurus! What a beast!
Who else nba players can do this for the age of 37. Omg ! There can only be Lebron James
6:42 the announcer called lebron needing 19 in the fourth for the Lakers to win, wild
OMG 😱 LeBron! Hmmm 🤔 was this an All Star game? Unbelievable after that I would just walk off the court bye 💪🏼
this team,  if ever they in the playoffs, I don't know if they can make it with this line up..if off night for lebron and no rebounder no shotblocker.. just give dwight a playing  time.
Born in 85, grow up seeing Jordan, kobe, lbj, Duncan, Shaq, Iverson, etc it has been great
Mama there goes that man  !!!!
9:18 kuzma can't believed it plus tht taunt him
For the people that's criticizing Mr. Russell Westbrook and being immature. Don't be disrespectful, it's just a game. Don't be so easily influenced by the media and people who can't play the game at all. If you can play better then show us. It's just a game people with no guarantees and for entertainment.  Let's get away from being such a negative society and encourage each other through our ups and downs.  Be an adult......and stop always criticizing and dividing.  We don't become better as a whole until we become better individuals. Everyone declines but he still broke a record that we never thought could be broken and is the triple double king.  Let's get better...... we should care more about what we do for our communities than a basketball game. We take entertainment to serious. IT'S JUST A GAME. If you want to critique something that makes a difference then critique the government  and shallow people that make the world worst. By judging  and being insecure of people who don't look like them.  If you don't like the entertainment that you chose to watch, then watch something else.  STOP IT....
LeBron James for 50 again how long can he keep this up it's coming down the stretch but will LeBron James have anything left coming into the play in tournament if the Lakers make it 😳💯🏀🙄👍🤗
This boys better get this dub I know dat !!
Kyle kuzma plsss back to you lakers
I can hear Shannon Sharpe right now
I’m gonna say it for Lebron. Join the bucks on a team friendly salary they have a solid team that could use him
I’m going be sick when he’s gone! 50 twice in a week. Possibly win the scoring tittle at age 37 🔥 👑
Imagin the LAKERS need this 37 year old to PUT UP 50! Every game just to WIN!. Bronny might not play with his father.
I know what lebron doin he decided to do it himself he knows Lakers don't have chance so he save his name. And do it one man players again.
LE50
Westbrook is 🗑️🗑️
LeSteroids
37 and still shouldering a team. Truely the GOAT 💪
Ad needs to be ashamed of himself
I'm a Clippers fan but it's scary to realize that LeBron still has some juice left to keep doing this 'til the playoffs. He has always had this "fuck it, I'll carry y'all" mode. Intriguing how much toll this must give him physically, though.
Is it a 1 winstreak again? Hope its not
One of the best bounce back games I’ve ever seen in my life
Lebron showing this generation you don't have to win by 3s alone
Was at the game. First time seeing Lebron in person. Incredible casual all time performance. No, I was not his biggest fan a decade ago (Sigh, I'm a Wizards fan haha) but you do need to get over it at some point and just appreciate how lucky we are to watch this all time player. He put on a friggin show tonight. Glad to have witnessed it.
Lebron is the GOAT
The goat
I was upset with myself when Kobe retired and I realized I never really watched him play live that much. Once he was gone I realized the greatness I had missed. I will not make this mistake with Lebron!
Lebron the most complete player. He can do everything inside the court.
Lebron taking it personally lmao
I just worry if Lebron can keep this up. Before Kobe got injured later in his career he was putting up crazy numbers then got injured. But Lebron is known for being Ironman but I still worry cause he’s 37
He reminds you all once again! Bow down to the King!!! Enjoy the show, while he reigns. If you feel otherwise, kindly accept my sympathy 😎👑
After the game, Kuzma whispered in Bron's ear, "Dang, bruh!  I thought we wuz frienz,"
50 let's see who can match this one.
Jordan wasn’t playing like this when he was 37!!!
King 🤴Bron
Westbrook is terrible!! These announcers were acting like it was the finals!!
LeBron has to score 50 plus to win games?? Come on Lakers please give hom some support.
Oh I'm tired, Monday the same who destroyed him after the pass to Melo will launch a GOAT debate again...😄  I'm a LBJ guy since 2003, but Lakers are not good, hope AD brings miracle but it might be late.
I love LeBron. I'll be happy for him when he retires just like I was happy for Kobe. I honestly hope his post career end up just as great as his NBA career. I know he will be at true peace knowing he left it all out there on the floor and ALL the greats respect him. This man literally been on top since I was 8 or 9 years old. Now I'm 25 and he still dropping 50..   If it wasn't for hair dye this dude would literally be the real life Uncle Drew ❌🧢 RESPECT KING JAMES
My goat is still Jordan. But man LeBron at age 37. One of the Greatest Player of all time. He literally carried his team at age 37. WTF MAN!?
Im happy Russell didnt get as much touches.... they win games.    Thank you King 🙏🏾🙏💜💛🐏  Greatness.
What a game by LBJ! Let’s make that play in game healthy and see what happens....
Talen Horton Tucker is Different 🤦🏾‍♂️🔥
Haven’t seen Washington all season but they look like they play street ball and that’s a good concern.
He will have the greatest stats in NBA history
ur the man  im with  lebron james  were ever u will go
LeGold
Its scary how similar these comments are
Lakers were just goofing around last game so they would pick up their 29th win on AD's 29th Birthday man lmao y'all keyboard junkies need to loosen up your bra this is alllll numerology 😂🍻🍺
This is the best game by far this year 👏..  The Counted Out LAKERS might be the best worst team that could transform in playoffs..  Didn't say win a championship..  But hey Play Ball and ..  LeBron is truly a Basketball 🏀  Marvel that proves his greatest  even tonight with 50Pts..  Also Austin Reeves is what every basketball coach used to produce on every level of competition, this guy has a John Wooden 1960's UCLA fundamental game that's lost even in 2022 coaching ..  And Malik Monk is a future superstar waiting to happen..
Lebron is the MVP
0:59 I respek u kuz Love Stu Announces Kuz
He will be sitting the next game with that knee soreness
LeBron going in 2018 playoff form
I’m a Lebron fan but He didn’t need to be in the game at that point .. He could’ve rolled an ankle or tore anything that was very selfish just for a headliner .
Skip still says lebron should do more and doesn't care about winning lmfao this team is shit yes he signed off it and holds some responsibility or maybe he didn't who knows maybe Palinka got a big dick and didn't like Lebron running stuff we will never know. But according too Skip I guess Lebron needs too average 85/45/35 too "care about winning". Other why's he's just chasing Kareem. LMFAO. No one ever said this about Brady, Peyton, Brees, Montana, Elway etc. When they were about too take all time passing record and no not ALL of them were winning really only Brady. Must be dat white boi complexion must be nice now look I'm no race baiter but I effing hate the hypocrisy that they only do it too black athletes esp Lebron. And god don't get me started when Bonds was gonna pass a white man in Baseball and take his record.. that's all I'm saying u picking up what I'm putting down if not wake the eff up. Only point I'm making. Much love homies 💕🥰
Those fade-away jumpers brought back memories of the late great Kobe Bryant carrying the Lakers to victory.
We need to talk about that THT poster
Why can't Lebron do this Sunday-Thursday because Skip Bayless really seems to forget to revisit these games if they didn't happen the night before yet will make a highlight reel of a loss if it happened on a Friday
Been tht..👑 Lebron has NOTHING 2PROVE 2ANY1 least of all media/'flip flooprs..' Sme media+ who've grossly unfairly criticized him since age 18.. Bron's 'taken ovr' tons of gmes & been 'clutch' thru-out his legendary career; & conts yr19. #lbj23_6🐐🔥😤🖤🙏🏽 #37yrsyng *1of1 #giftedintelligenthandsomestrongblessedblackking #morethananathlete #ignorehaters #striveforgreatness🚀 #letsgoteam✊🏽🔥 #stilllakeshow💜💛 #nba75🎉✌🏾💯🔥🏀🏅🏆  #spreadlovenothate🖤🙏🏽🌎
Conclusion: Lebron really got to drop 50 points to get a W for the Lakers.
LeBron being LeBron. I still can't get over they lost to the Spurs and the Rockets though. they looked like a different team
Lakers won? wtf
https://youtu.be/TBkhcW1k0-k
No Matter what you say, LBJ is still a Beast!!!
The King👑👏👏👏💪💪
LeBron HAS to drop over 40 points a game to keep his team in position to win games, thats how bad the rest of the roster is.  But then you have haters say he's stat padding when they win, but if he drops 40 in a lose then he didn't do enough. Nothing ever changes lol.
Easy Basketball for LBJ
Did Westbrook really come to LA to continue being trash
8:05 Damn that's a really nice move THT
People missing out on LeBron James 💯 talking all that shit watch the King get another Ring before he retires 💯👑🦁
7:59 This is almost the exact reverse layup they wanted LBJ to take at the end of regulation vs the Rockets.  I guess... he had a better angle this time? 😅
lebron needs to put up 50pts to make lakers win. lol
Get Westbrick TF outta LA with AllDone3
LA Lakers need to be in play off mj magic Johnson
Wla kasi legit center kaya hirap manalo lakers.
It didn’t take him scoring 50 for me to appreciate one of the greatest to ever lace them up!
今天老詹手感真好😄
Acts 17:30 The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent, 31 because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by Jesus Christ the Lord whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.”   Romans 3:23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, tyhrough the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.   1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Acts 16:30 Then he brought them out and said, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” And they said, “Believe in the Lord be saved, you and your household.   Repent and trust Jesus Christ as your Saviour and your Lord. True repentance involves a change of heart which includes sorrow for sin and determination to lead a holy life.   Christ deliver the repentant person from sin's penalty by dying on the cross. If not, you will be judged by the law, no one can be justified by law as all of us have transgressed the law one way or the other.   Seek the Lord Jesus while he may be found and turn away from sins and turn to him wholeheartedly as he is coming back to judge the world. Revelation 22: 11 Let the evildoer still do evil, and the filthy still be filthy, and the righteous still do right, and the holy still be holy. 12“Behold, I am coming soon, bringing my recompense with me, to repay each one for what he has done.   Grace and love from God in Jesus Christ be multiplied in your heart you all
Lakers Never Needed Million Stars 2 or 3 maybe THATS IT THATS ALL
Lebron should score 80 points everygame for them to win the finals.
Its very easy against poor teams
I hope LAKERS win next game and end the 1 win curse. Seeing KING doing his thing.
its sad to think that Lebron needs to make 50ppg to win for lakers at the age of 37.
can't wait for all the losers crying about bron stat padding
6:12 This move is some ISH right here.  Straight impossible  And Stanley checked AD and LBJ's reaction 😅
Nice game for LeBron 😍
Lebron is using real player percentage!!!
The NBA needs to give this man an award for the performance he keeps putting on for everyone. He's amazing, I wish his team could support him better though
I really don’t understand Lebron 😂 37 wit 2 50 balls in a week?? this is ridiculous atp
THIS MAN THE GOATTTTTTTTT <3
the goat is back.
Go lakers❤
King James
I told people when the Lakers were tanking that LeBron is fully prepared to put this team on his back like he did in the Cavs days, and they all looked at me like I was crazy. Some even thought it was nuts to say that 37 isn’t as old as we all think, lol. Nobody knew he was going to have two 50-point games in a week, though, with one of them being against the Warriors. Not even me. But, I think it’s safe to say that he is capable of going above & beyond to save this team & season. Never underestimate a man that thrives on hate and criticism.
the goat doing goat things.
Bron said "I'm giving them a 50 piece. Don't take me out until they eatin that 50 piece".
Lakers win only when Lebron scores 50 or more pts
LABRON JAMES HAS NOTHING ELSE TO PROVE,HE IS THE BEST TO LACE UP A PAIR OF SNEAKERS..PLUS LABRON NOT OUT EVERY NIGHT DRINKING & PARTYING.HE HAS DISCIPLINE &IT SHOWS WITH HIS BODY&ABLITY TO STILL PLAY THIS GAME AT THEE HIGHEST LEVEL POSSIBLE.WHO CAN BAD MOUTH LBJ-REALLY.THE PROOF IS IN THE PUDDING.YALL KNOW LBJ WAS GREAT OVER THE YEARS,BUT YALL NEVER KNEW HE WAS THR GREAT-NEXT LEVEL,AN ANIMAL LIKE PREHISTORIC WITH HIS GAME..SINCE 2003 "COME ON MAN"...
Lebron James is just incredible.Still balling like a champ at year 19
The game was a blowout and he stays in the game so he can pad his stats.
The look on his face @5:34 he knew he wasn’t about to lose to Kyle kuzma
Pretty good for a 37 year old man who can’t do this or that. They say Lebron can’t shoot, he is not skilled, he needs superteams, he’s not clutch. He brought a  title to the Lakers. Lebron did what he said he would do. The dude wins so much that his detractors will call him a failure win he doesn’t win a chip every yr. That’s the ultimate respect. They say..Lebron lost 5 finals, he sucks. I say he’s played in 9 finals and won 4 and lost 5. That’s impressive. Let’s put it into context. Lebron played against the best team from that respected conference every time he went to the finals. He won 4 and lost to the better team 5 times. I know the mentally unstable people will say that Lebron needed superteams, well then let’s make sure we attach that narrative to everyone else as well. Give this guy his roses.
Appreciate all pro ballers, they gave it all. Life, blood, sweat and tears. After Lebron, another big thing will surely come, so savor it while the next chosen one will come.
I will guarantee you Tom Brady's existence is a huge influence on Lebron. He wants to do to basketball what Tom did to football. Hell imma make a video on it. Sub to my channel 😎
Westbrook and Lebron combined for 55 pts!
Weeks ago, Bron got booed in homegame but take it personal and drop two 50 pts game
Bring back kuzma asap
Wesbrook needs a solid fans who suffort him the fans of lakers fan is so very toxic..
Galing ni bakes
Lebron needs to retire.
We won!
Lakers fans is so very toxic
bron must scores 50+ points in order to win.
I'm sorry LeBron but you can't play like a completely different person every other game and blow winning shot opportunities. We're going to have to start calling you LeWestbrick.
Cuz gotta drop 50 for them to win that’s sad
Anybody who knows anything about basketball,  knows you should not be able to do this in year 19
,,,I Hate tom Brady but I give his crown and I pay money to watch him play ,,,,,so you can hate lebron all you want but give the man his crown and pay to watch his game,,,,,because next 50 you will be one of those people who  watced the greatest  of nba all time
One man team. Almost.
LeBron James, carrying teams at 37.
Let’s gooo
THE KING THE GOAT THE MVP THE CHAMPIONS THE CHOSEN ONE THE BEST PLAYER OF NBA LEBRON JAMES 👑🎖️🏆🏅🥇🥈🥉🏀🐐💪 LONG LIVE THE KING RESPECT THE GREATNESS IN THE HALL OF FAME
everytime lakers won lbj will not leave the floor. but everytime they  loss his gone.. going str8 in the locker room. no sportsmanship..
Lebron have to drop 50 piece every other game just to win lol cmon russ
Keep up the good work king James 💪🏽💯🏆
Stephen a Smith don't ever tell lebron to shut it down again
Goat James for ya
Looks like the Lakers can only win a game against the league's sorriest teams if LB drops 50, otherwise they lose.
The wizards are terrible
Unbelievable 🏀
The only thing that lebron lack is the killer mentality, mamba mentality. If he have that he can beat jordan as the goat.
Now what people is going to say about LA by the way they played pretty good and a like the fact that bogal tried other player but lets be honest the wizards are kind of short handed and la as well but hey you have to play for what you got....
37 and still relevant in the NBA 🔥🔥🔥
He not playing on Sunday against the suns
Malik monk and Austin reaves combined make less than 3M. And are the guys closing out games. Lakers better pay them this summer!
Appreciate gr8ness. 37yrs old n still gon. It will b a sad day when LeBron hang #23/6 up.
Long live the king
Bron is on another level at center position...  what a great player..
i love what he did tonight putting his team on his back because i am a lebron fan and hes my favorite player lets just appreciate his greatness and his mentality
Russell waistbrook🤣
Lebron doing Lebron things
Why is chasing for triple doubles frowned at but not chasing after 50 pts? Both are stat chasing.
3:00 You can walk, AD? 🤔
Sobokan ng LA tangalin si carmelo cgurado bwenasin sila..ksi si carmelo ang malas sa LA kahit saan cya pomonta na team mamalasin
Most consistent player of all time! Age 37 doing the unthinkable 🔥🔥🔥
180 ° Turn!   SEEK YE the LORD while He may be found, call ye upon Him while He is near: [Isaiah 55:1-6-13]  FROM THAT time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. [Mt. 4:1-17-25]  I TELL you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. [Luke 13:1-3-35]  REPENT YE therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; [Acts 3:1-19-26]  BRING FORTH therefore fruits meet for repentance: [Mt. 3:1-8-17]  THE LORD is not slack concerning His promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. [2 Peter 3:1-9-18 KJV]  180 ° Turn!
Clippers the heart of LA my ass...
Now LeBron playing Stat pad ... But not for the play in .. 😆 🤣 😂
Built different ✨
Those were tough shots too
the PROBLEM is hes not doing this when needed, they just lost 4 straight, then turned around & lost 2 straight against weak teams, where was this then?? looks like stat paddin to me💯
As a freaking Spurs fan since Duncan and admiral days, i'm happy to have witnessed LeBron. He was 1-2 against the Spurs, but damn we're fortunate to always have the better team against him. LBJ is one hell of a player, arguably a better team player than MJ
Kahit ako man kaya ko cguro makapuntos ng higit 50.. sakin nakafocus ang bola e🤣
Wesbrick lol.
That cut is Legend
LeBron be like... "Fine, I'll do it myself"
The graphics it's look like NBA2K🥰🔥💪🏼🙏
This should be LBJ VS WAS!
Lot of travel
So lakers only win if Lebron is dropping 50+
LBJ’s   2K build:  6’9” PG/SG/SF/PF/C Pass First Playmaker/ Scoring Machine All Badges on Hall of Fame  1 Silver Badge for FreeThrows 😁
now that's the real lebron james
Westbrook wonder why we call him Westbrick 5 points man come on😒 I could’ve got 15 in 31 minutes
The King is back
Malik "Monkey" Monk lang ang sakalam.
Fuck the haters!!!!
No fucking way Bron had 50 again.
Stat chasing
Witness Greatness!!!!! After 19 years in the league and playing against world talent. Like it or not he is the MJ of our era.
He e was me
Lebron that nigga😈
We just witnessed another triple-single from Brick!
Let's appreciate Lebron effort and Greatness while he's in the league🔥☝🇵🇭👊😎💪💯🔥🔥🇵🇭
I think LBJ can turn up like this almost whenever he wants..  I think he can do this like maybe  90% - 95% of games “IF” he really wanted to.. & if stamina isn’t an issue..  But the crazy part is.. he’s a Pass First Playmaker at heart- loves getting team involved- Also can be a Scoring Machine whenever he wants.
1 WIN STREAK IS NOW OVER !!! bwahahahahahahaha
Great win for the Lakers. But, they need to be consistent. Let's see if they can rake up another win against the Suns.
King James is something else. 37 years old and he’s putting up 50 pointers like crazy
*Love his game* *At age 40 I was schooling 19,20,21 and 22 year old neighborhood ballers beating them 12-4,12-5,12-6 and 12-8 playing basic basketball* *Back down,turn around,of the dribble shots,BASIC* *The whole hood was watching and clowning them*
Damn I hate he had to do kuz like that but it’s #LakeShow over everything 🟣🟡
LeBron about to miss another game. 😂😂 I love when he balls like this thought.
wow
Tomorrow bouta be a good day🤭
this was the season i thought KD would finally overtake him as the best player but i guess that's happening next season
King or 🐐 is not the problem! RW is not the issue!🔑 David they do not need him weak body not his fault!🏀 Team Lakers no problem!👀 Magic & Media management & coach are the issue!🔑🏀🏆
I  told y'all LeCarry need to score 50 points per game to win every match they have lmao
Bro Russell Westbrook is an embarrassment to the sport at this point. Imagine being a top 5 paid athlete in the league and putting up numbers like he does. Absolutely shameful.
Westbrick at it again
LeBron proves hes the GOAT every season its insane
LBJ need another ten 50 pt games for us to have a chance to make the playoffs 😅
This one was on KUZ jajajaja 🤣
2:30
Go LAKERS♥️💚🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓
See.. Lebron needs to have a 50 points to win and carry his teammates to victory. If michael jordan will replace lebron i believe lossing streak will continue
Lakers for the win! . . . . Oh, it's just the Wizards. Move along..
2:23
At this point lakers not winning unless lbj drops 50
Lol why lebron go off like that?
Needs to do 50 to carry them
He’s the goat
The way kuz play,amazing!
Idol LeBron James Idol LeBron James Idol LeBron gobucks34 💓♥️💚💚💛💛💜🇵🇭
LakerNation 💪🏿 👑 LBJ!
Congrats Lakers from fans of GSW

Pick and rolls just with AD this team is unbeatable y’all are gonna see
50 piece again for the 🐐🔥
Gabriel is like a shadow running on the court.
and they will lose next game.
Big three looking like a big single 🔥
King of NBA LEBRON JAMES🥰
If lakers didnt won this game. They show Russ game stats.
Lebron on his Thanos. Fine I’ll do it myself vibe
it seems like Lebron's speed has slowed down - age is catching up with him
Don't call king for nothing
Being the official channel for the nba the editing so poor my goodness
Nice g idol but the other need to step up in all games to win.
lebron james is now leading the league in scoring...
A whopping 1 game winnin streak. Can we say see yawl in the finals..
5 fucking points from Russ????
Right now lakers 9 position but lebron has capability to reach lakers best 8 and qulify to playoff. I hope it will happen.
Lakers gonna be dangerous in the play off. Don't sleep on them
I was so sad that they loss last game but they came back to make happy to win the game
I don't think I was old enough to have memories when LeBron got drafted
ReactionDROPPING!!! subscribe and tune in👨🏾‍💻
lebronto version back at it
maka sigaw c kingkong akala mo pasok sa playoffs🤣🤣🤣
I guess bron has to have atleast a 50 pt game for lake to win ,😂
Wow another 50+ pt game in year 19...wtf LeBron lol
It will take years to witness another player like LeBron! I’m just glad to live in this basketball generation🤩
LeGOAT!!!!
THT Screaming in Kuzma's face at 9:17 lol :v
He is the stat king...NOT a killer or a winner
for sure lebron will not play their next game
360 combined for 55 pts. Smh
Mama…there goes that man 😭🙏🏽🙌🏼🤴🏾🔥…
Wait Porzings not even a starter in the wizards?
Legoat
THT gonna get drug tested after this game lol
Lebron's time has not end yet. Right now he is far better from many other young players . Lakers majar problm is injured playes like anthoy davis and few other next year they will come back with bang.
I knew it was clip. Lebron rarely has two back to back bad games.
Giving up 100+ points to wizards…
mf westbrook still on that wizard roster
I wonder why they kept lebron in even though the game was over
💜💛
LeBron is going after the regular season scoring title, lol. He knows it's a wash as far as winning anything.
So much load ... And yet fans booing him for what? ...
Here in Zimbabwe we all know that Lakers always get one winning streak this one will last for 24hrs they should enjoy it while it last
Despite the loss of Wizards, I appreciate the effort of Kuzma, He really wants to win.
Just think, this is Lebron’s 14th career 50 pointer and James Harden has already had 23. Kobe had 25. Jordan had 31. In a scorer’s era, we’ll see a lot more of these from a whole lotta players. Year 19 is impressive no matter what though. Hats off.
why is THT shouting at Kuzma's face? LMAO
I’m not impressed by the 50 points. You don’t lose to rockets
Feel bad for LBJ. has to work so hard just to win at his age. Where is WestBrk & Davis and Anthony and Others???Howard???
LeBron scored 50 against the lowly wizards, now he'll spend the next two or three games on the bench recouping, and don't forget, they play the Suns next, a perfect excuse, to claim he has a sore knee 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
this was one of the best lakers game in a while.......bringing back 2019-2020 vibes
Fun fact LeBron has the most seasons avg 27+ points he also has the most consecutive seasons avg 25+ points He is hands down the greatest scorer of the basketball all-time excluding nobody
18 points lead under 2 minutes and stil Lbj in the game this show how bad the Lakers team
I think it's time for youngins with lebron to start and put the old dudes off the bench
Nanalo.kc mahina kalaban
Well lebron your going to have to put up over 60 points next game because your playing the suns next and knowing the lakers record against winning teams it’s safe to say that you won’t be winning that one.
The strategy for the Lakers to win is simple, LeBron just needs to score 50 lol
Dang the Wizards suck. Their entire offense is iso's for mostly trash players and they have no defensive scheme or rim protection
westbrick with 5 points? is this a joke? how much is he getting paid? he made 2 baskets!!!
Bruh bron greatness is just masterful we may never see anything like him ever again 37 in da 25 in erry category insane no cap lol stay safe RIP Bob Saget Betty White Sidney Poitier Emilio Delgado BLM God bless pray for Ukraine checkout The Main Squeeze 🙏
What a freaking legend man. I just cant believe it!
Bro really has to score 50 for them to win 😭
That was real nifty you 5 me
Kuzma got destroy by the KING.
Lakers need this type of energy every night no matter the team
LAKERS WIN BABY!! 😍💜💛🔥
This game was as exciting as watching Orlando Magic vs Detroit Pistons
50 point game was good but I have a interesting topic, is this going to be more than a 1 game win streak. I'll give lebron all the props in the world if he does this Sunday against the suns.
Westbrook was trash as always .... Should trade him rn for extra icy hot for bron and the lakers final stretch for this play in thing
Added comment 667.
It’s like this dude is aging backwards. LBJ truly one of the goats 🐐 💯
Westbrick being westbrick again
Disliked only because I got 6 damn ads in less than a 10 min video! Absolutely ridiculous at this point!!!
i wish lebron is not a pass first guy lol
I hope they keep reaves long term man..
i love president vladimir putin
Lebron is on a mission to surpass the career points by Karl Malone   and next is Kareem Abdul Jabbar.
Can’t say it’s against the wizards because gramps just did it against GSW 🤣
#GOAT JAMES!!! WHERE THE HATERZ GO?!
Omg the Lakers beat the wizards , mybe they're about to turn it arnd , hahahaha ...tomorrow's news
The great Lebron J.
I would it be a shame if I was a Lakers fan, the worst team on the #NBA
As a Russ fan I don’t see him playing with any joy at all anymore the publics constant criticism of his game has driven him to this low of a point as a player but there’s always better day ahead
Wow LeBron ❤️🏀🏀
Wow man this is bringing me back to 2016 vibe on Toronto
Now let's actually get this man Bron some help next season. Younger players who can shoot and defend. we wasted this man 19th season
LBJ!!! Goat!!!
As LeBron says himself, He's not getting slower he's just getting stronger.
LeBron truly is the greatest of all time my god is he even human? Now it was the wizards but damn
Shiitttt if i was the coach i'll bench westbrook and cut down his playing time... I dont give a damn if he's complaining and whining about minutes cause his ass only be doing more harm than good and costing Lakers games, he be turning over the ball way too much and taking unnecessary tough shots for no reason and playing solo like he's the only star player, bruh i don't have a problem if you taking tough shot as long as you making them, but he cant make it.
Mans still playing like 15 years earlier
LeBron destroying narrative and media imposed expectations
Gotta put to rest the narrative that LeBron can’t shoot
lakers finally win a game for once lol
LeBron and mybe Westbrook need to go in the post more especially LeBron,  he's gotta bring back so.e of the Miami days
KOLBE OR JOKEDAN COULDN'T DO WHAT Leee🐏 JAMES BEEN DOING WITH THESE TRASH ASS FRANCHISE BY THEMSELVES.
Finally the Lakers got the win tonight over the Wizards
Best Laker game highlights I seen this year.  Good Friday night !   Kuz !
Another 50 piece 🥶 Goat 👑
If porzingas let the game come to him more and not rush things I think he cld be super talented
This is why this man ain't getting healthy. Y'all really need hin to score 50 to win.
I think Rui can be a baller
Lebron would be in MVP talks if LAKERS wasn’t on 9th seed
Lebron is so marvelous much ❗
Love seeing 👑 in attack mode
Lebron Hayme
Wow niceeeee congrats Lakers 😂
LeChoke, Lejoke, LeLegend... Lebron
Nba must not be bias he is the MVP  With his personality his i promise school his family as husban and father a good example for upcoming generation!! then inside the court with his madness IQ and talent Then insane speed & vission and power he is totally a superhuman  for me he is more than a goat GOD give him a streght longivity as reward for his kindness and humbleness  because he is the choosen one to be the FUTURE GOD OF BASKETBALL #versusYoungAge? #age37or27? #CenterGuardForwardLeaderEverything
where are the ppl hating the lakers now saying L on my prediction. lebron carried 50/7/6 and a block at 37 in year 19 is just unbelievable one of the greats appreciate it while u can
8:12 they play valorant for sure
Congratulations Lakers you finally won a game without embarrassing yourselves🙄🙄
Lebron is back what a game by lakers
Bron is goin to be number in NBA all-time scoring in 3 more games
Appreciate what we witness. This is a Legend. KING JAMES!!!!!
Reeve's gonna be a monster later on watch if Bron is teaching him
KUZMA was feeling himself..but BOY IM LIKING THIS NEW LAKESHOW
lebrons prime just got started
THE MOFUCKIN GOAT MAN PUT RESPECT ON HIM there WONT be ANYONE LIKE HIM AGAIN ENJOY IT WHILE YOU CAN CUZ MAN WE ARE ALL GONNA MISS EM WHEN HES GONE
I think the Lakers will have a record for the most 1 game winning streaks in a season 😂😂
Worst edit of highlights for a 50 point game
Lebron's game is incredible when the opponent is intentionally lose the game.. you are just watching WWE entertainment...  What a disgrace....
LeBron at the start of his Career: Carrying  LeBron at the end of his Career: Still Carrying Give this man a break.
THT🔥
LBJ and Reaves🔥
My God LeBron went off for 50 tonight  because  he knew the Lakers need  this win he's  basically  gonna have score 45 to 50 pts just for them to win lol.
lbj old but gold
Oh oh watch out. The LAKERS are back.                         Of the rest of the western conference.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
lafag scores 50 against a scrub squad that u should beat.. AND YOU STILL MISSING THE PLAYOFFS LMFAO!!!!!!!!!!!
Are we really going to pretend like beating the Wizards with a team that has LeBron is any type of accomplishment? Is this really what Lakers basketball has come to? Is this in any way worth applause?
I'm tired of the lakers  not putting enough effort / fight they are all playing as if they are off a step and keep loosing except for LBJ it's hard to watch and see LeBron give his all and come up short because of the team wake up and play as if every game could be your last!!!!!
Yo lebron wtf
Maaaaan. Another night that LeBron carries the Lakers. But, hey... a win's a win.
It's amazing that at 37, LeBron is still better than like 95% of NBA players!
LeGoat
Wish we had a decent roster around Lebron in his end of his career!
LeBron and Westbrook combined for 55! Unstoppable duo!
Respect to the king
Let’s go lakers
If LeBron has do that every game, I fear that Father time would catch up sooner than later.
Lebron gotta drop 50 just to beat bad teams… sad 😞
so good for so long! 👑
It's the wizards LeBron.....relax lol. Ur too old ...u gonna have to sit again next game
His retirement gonna hit different 🥲
SKIP on Monday: Lebron is stat padding! hahaha
GOAT JAMES!!!!
Ill have 2 fifty pieces please.
Wait did LeBron make 50 points twice this week? Or I'm tripping?? 🤯 Man it's going to be sad when he hangs it up! 😔 I may not cry but I'll definitely feel it! 💔
If LeBron is going to carry this team to the finals again like what he did to cavs in 2018... SNL is going to make another skit...
Keep Bron Talen Malik trade the entire team. Or go g league this is embarrassing 40 year old man doing everything.
Nanalo lang ng isa, yabang na ng LeBron. 😂PALIBHASA mga mahihina nakakalaban e
Is this the only way the Lakers can win? 50 point performances by LBJ? I hope the rest of the team steps up come playoff time.
Imagine being 37 years old and having to drop 50 points or more for your team to even come close to winning
Where were all these comments after the lottery Rockets smashed them.  What about the 6 game losing streak, the 9th seed??  Lefraud at it again with the empty stats and empty calories, straight to a fishing trip in April. 😂
Lakers will go to the playoffs if LeBron score 50 every game HAHAHAHAHAH
You robbed me off that game changing three by only showing lbj celebrating at the Halfcourt… lol anyways like for a Lakers dub 👍
Me and my ma went to this game and she finally respected bron
ENJOY The One Game Winning Streak , While It Last lmao ahahaha
I came here hunting for the haters
i was bet Los Angeles Lakers $200,000,000
Oh my GOAT-ness
LeBron is close of being the 2nd all time in career points
where is the seasonal triple double player? who is cup cake?
THE LAKERS ARE PATHETIC
that fadeaway shot was smooth one of my fave lebron shot. Man is 37 and still playing like he's 27. My greatest of all time player right here brooo
Lakers need lebron to score 50 and bench westbrook in final qtr to win a game.
That big guy makes my hearts jumps at the level. Nice game bron.. your the best 37 yrs old in the league .
Russ fans last game: RUSS JUST HAD 30 ON 50% SHOOTING WITH 2 TURNOVERS. BRON HAD SEVERAL TURNOVERS and HORRIBLE SHOOTING. HOLD HIM ACCOUNTABLE😡🤬” Russ fans watching Russ drop 5 on 18% fg and bron drop 50 on 70% fg vs the wizards “…..”
Holy shit this team is good without Russ
I don't care what nobody say Lebron should be leading in the MVP voting.
Chop the hair some more bron . We need to be a playoff seed 👂🏾👀
LeBron doesn't have to do or accomplish anything else, for me, to be called the most dominant and accomplished of his era. He's already there in my humble  opinion. I don't care if he wins another title or not. I love basketball and just seeing him put on a show like he did tonight is all that I'd be happy with if that's what the rest of his career looks like. You could really feel the rest of the team get3 energized from the way he was playing. I love to see that.
LeStatPadding
#4 on the Wizards looks just as small as Isaiah Thomas. Hope he’s given a chance
Omg bron
Appreciate greatness!
Goat showed up tonight... very nice L
Did lebron hugged and shaked hands after the game this time? 😁
He only does this vs bad teans smh
I hate the Lakers for not surrounding this man with prime talent to preserve him. Unethical fucks
No russel good game
Lebron brought me back with this one👏🔥💯
Lakers won another title after defeating the Wizards, another 2022 NBA Finals championship victory, hurray!!!!
The Lost Angeles Lakers defeated the eleventh-seeded Washington Wizards. Everytime the former wins, the LeBronites always yapping about James' greatness, verve, and so on. Both teams are still under five hundred, which isn't anything to write home about. There's approximately seventeen game left in the regular season. This particular Lakers unit are in for the greatest shock of their lives. Ciao!
Haters gonna hate.only player with lifetime endorsement with nike.📢📢📢📢🤣😂🤣😂🤣
What’s really messed up is this Lakers team just pissing away a very high level season from Lebron that we might not see next year 🙏🏾🙏🏾
I don't want to be killjoy of sort...but, it's against Wizards. Why not against Bucks or Nets or Suns?
This was all lebron and the rest where garbage, gotta give lebron respect for carrying this trash team by himself amazing performance from LeGoat
even when he wins, he's still a loser
If LBJ got 50 ppl would say he's into records, but if he plays normally  they'll lose know the differents
Not a quality highlights, some highlights are cut
Told yall he is the goat
LBJ ... GREAT BASKETBALL PLAYER. THE GOAT.
Lebron is The Best Player in the world regardless if we're tired of saying it or not he's still the best
When Bron retires it's going to be sad. 4 rings in 20 yrs with a the scoring title. Was hoping he out did MJ finals MVP 2 short All defense 1st team 4 short. All defense team 3 short. Defense player of yr 1short. Scoring leader 9 short . Steal leader 3 short. Rookie of the yr yes 1-1. Bron got him in assist over all 3 more a game, and 4 more rebounds per game. Not bad 6. 9 ft 280 vs 6.6 ft vs 225.
My only problem with this is that it’s Friday and now I have to wait for Monday to see Shannon’s reaction on Undisputed
Russ really earning his $44m going 2/11
Why would y’all show the 3 @ 5:11 You idiots
Russ and bron combined for 55 points 🔥
Imagine you think you a good team and you can’t even beat the Lakers
Cut the logo shot out? LOL sum haters
feel sorry for lebron. lakers ruined this season for him.
Bahahaha…..lequeen is a joke…..can’t wait for Sunday’s game against a team above 0.500
Westbrook 2/11= $44m
Lebron and westbrook combined 55 pts..
Sheesh Bron & Russ combined for 55
I'll praise russell westbrook before I'll praise that fake ass Jesus religion bullshit
For Lakers to actually win is that LJ needs to make atleast 50 pts a game for them to win....
Kispert tuff mf
Ain't none change they better get some young guys next year or the clippers gonna sweep them again
We are witnessing GREATNESS with the King dropping another 50 piece while on his throne. LONG LIVE THE KING!
Now lebron will sit out next game lol. It's ashame if lebron doesn't drop 50 the lakers cannot win
It's been so long since I've seen a Lakers blowout win. If they play like this even half of the season, then Lakers will be in the title conversation.
Really wish he would have better teammates
Year 19...sheeesshhhh
Congrats LAKERS 1 GAME WINNING STREAK LONG LIVE THE KING
Yea he's "37"
Grown strong black man playing with a bunch of kid's, let them all know who the goat is LBJ!!!
Russ some ass on this team! I don't know if he lost it but man it tough watching him
Grabe c lodi James naghalimaw na 50p
I wonder how the Lakers would play if Anthony Davis healthy.
Other players gotta step up. Lebron is still that man on the court but he can't score and defend all 5 positions every second of the game
happy for lebron for getting that 50 piece but the lakers are still trash 😂😂
THT is OC af. Dude looks lost most of the time
wow just wow
Westbrook.. you are Westbrook. Don't forget that. Let's go get to the playoffs
Mudaog lang og hinay ang kontra...hehe...
The king!!
Here we go, winning streak again. 🤣
Micheal Jordan: “Damn Lebron, it must be nice. I’m tryna get like you my boi”.
He really wants to pass Malone this season
Le 50 piece
non-bearing game
J Worthy Shocked that LeBallHog scored fifty at age 37 and in year 19 by stat padding
LeBron finally realized that scoring 27-30+ pts is not enough and decided to score 50+ pts in order for the Lakers to win.
LeGoat
LBJ scoring is impressive but come on Lakers if LBJ needs to put up 50 every game to win he wont have anything left
Let the bronsexuals have their celebration 🎉.  The Lakers season is almost done
There will never be another Lebron James.
Look at LeBron, one night he was booed by the fans, and very soon he showed who the boss, while he was not needed, is an Iranian proverb that says: the word of the people is the wind. But he is a full-time fighter for his team. But look at Russell, all this meme and all the criticism and criticism, spare no progress. To become a legendary athlete, you do not need only talent and genius, personality, this is what you definitely need along with them.
Bahhhhhh
Lakers keep blowing hot and cold. Nothing teams catching the Lakers cold and good teams suffering from LeBronchitis.
ever heard 37 year old carrying the team every game and still be the bad man???
The old guy carrying the loads.Damn Bron.
LeBron will be NBA’s top scorer of all-time pretty 🔜
Leee🐏 JAMES WITHOUT PIPPEN>JOKEDAN WITH PIPPEN.
Bron just decides when to be great. Lol. He’s lazy.
Bron was literally getting compared to BEN SIMMONS for the other night, and y'all expect him to be quiet in the next game? At home?! Against KUZMA?!! 🤣
Y’all can keep hating this man if y’all want to 😭😭😭
The fact that lebron is having to put in such monster performances to win these games shows how bad this team really is. Like the other night when he dropped over 50 they were still down by 10 late in the game but managed to end up winning. At 37 you can’t expect him to do this every single game and that’s exactly why they won’t get far in the playoffs if they even make it past their play in games at all. Curious to see what they do this off-season to improve the team
8:05 THT turned into Kobe
Bald LeBron will be unstoppable.
HE'S 37!!!!!!!!!! AHHAAHAHAHA... 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
LeBron need 2 assists to reach the 30k 10k 10k club 👑
King James drop 50 points
As we've seen... MJ & LBJ really doing good giving big respect on each other!!! I just said only Fans and Haters really doing Bad and everyday collide in comments! only haters can't appreciate on what LBJ does!
Just nuts. Absolutely unbelievable , I need to hear a Doris Burke speech about what Lebron has been doing this season
SAS with the magic words “ lebron will never be the goat “
THT @ 9:19 🤣🤣🤣  mans got no respect for kuz 💀
7:53 “Great effort Kuz, but I’m still the king”
Watching him play like this, im scare
What LeBron could do if he is a score-first player
This Man, King LBJ, GOAT, could have averaged 40PTS per season if he focused only on scoring. #GOAT
💪💪💪
LeBron is averaging 30 pts on 52% shooting in year 19. One of the greatest athletes ever. 🗣
Great game for LeBron and a WIN!
Lebron James is the GOAT🐐🐐🐐
LBJ has played much better after he got rid of that hair thing he was wearing, it was holding him back...
Broooo his beast knows no limits 🧐🚨
I think LeBron finally accept the fact that he can't rely on Westbrook... And I think Westbrook accept the fact that he rely on himself.... ✌️
Le50 piece again,take the L bron haters…Still greatest and best player of all time
Will always be a fan Lebron James
Russel Westbrick Stats - 5 pts in 31 mins of play, 2 for 11 FG. This motherfuc** crybaby need to just sit for the remaining games, trade him for 1st round picks!
King 👑
The g.o.a.t lebron James ❤️
Westbrook needs to be tough from criticism and step up this game. Prove the critics that he can still produce.
If we are going to be honest here - that's a nice magnetized ball Lebron is using starting around the 9min mark in the 4th. They use it on commercial breaks at 6:28 as he overshot that and - 1:41 again overshot. Just like the play-in - and he's celebrating lol But give him a magnetized ball and he is all about shooting. It's amazing how his ability to play is going away and people are just so oblivious
Greatest Player of all time
9:18 ThT at Kuz face 😂
nakachamba ang lakers kasi mahina ang kalaban
dude when I saw Lebron scorced another 50 points the only thing I was saying " LeGOAT LeGOAT LeGOAT !!!!" Because he is the greatest to ever do it.
Gabriel deserves more minutes he has lot of energy for a big could be good with Lebron on floor too and AD.
Just wow, lebron needs to score 50 or more for their team to win lmao
GOAT JAMESSSSSSS🐐
Good win but remember it’s only the wizards
Bron is insane 🔥
There's 6 ads in this video
LeBron making up for his bad game. That's how great players do it!
The league WILL feel different when LeBron retires. Regardless who you believes the GOAT, still appreciate what he's brought to the league.
what the fuck wizards
What a game by lbj6 with 50 points . .
put some SpecK on his name. thats my guy, #goatJames..Give this man his flowers while hes still playing. recognize greatness. Just get in baby, just get in.
I really love Reaves' IQ and hustle 💯
Yeah man..
I appreciate what LBJ dropping 50 points 2x this week but the fact that wb only score 5 points is worrisome plus LBJ is not suppose to take this so much load at his age
IF LEBRON WOULDVE PUT HIS FUCKING EGO. HE WOULD HAVE HAD LONZO AT 1. LIANGELO AT 2. LAMELO AT 3. AND LEBRON AT 4. AD 5. BRO YOU LEBRON ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS OFFERED TO FOR FREE. LOOK YOU GOONA HAVE SHOOTERS AND DEFENSIVE PLAYERS. IN 3 OUT IF 5
Now he’s “mVp” probably too 🤣🤣🤣
Good game
I can't imagine the NBA without Lebron😢🏀👑
nba showing missed shots of westbrook
This is pushing lebron to the limit, like kobe he might get injured
9:22 dudes sitting courtside trynna act unimpressed by Bron while wearing their Buckle jeans and same black hats lmao
🤯
Westbrook carries again! Look at those assists
Wow this guy man amazing
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄
This R.Wbrick was 2 for 11 against the Wizards....That's 4 points if my math is right...... Against the Wizards.
The Russ trade made both teams worse
LEBRON IS NOT HUMAN
The lakers finally found a D league team they can copete with
4:03. your welcome
2:59 😳
Remember at 37 many are already retiring like Kobe, lebron at that age still making fiddy!!
For that LEBRON hater that he seen tonight thanks....
Lebron doing all he can do to stop from being eliminated ......
Love him or Hate him, lebron is fun to watch. Once he retires, who's gonna receive so much hate/love like he does. Watch till we can't anymore.
Lebron 37 years old!! Long live for the king
AD, Lebron, and Westbrook combined for 55pts tonight! Incredible
Yo Kuzma 6 fts tho....anyway GOAT 🐐 James does it again...👑
Lebron best points
Washington ka Laban NYU bano 😂😂😂
The GOAT King James back at it!👑🐐💪
This old head really dropped two 50 points games in like 10 days. He really is build different
KING
They said that he cant carry a team.
lupit ni kalabaw
nah bro just sit out the rest of the season. next year will be better for sure.
The KING💪
LAKERS VS LAKERZ
That’s a 50 piece. A nickel is just 5 pts unles you got a double nickel aka 55 pts. Who is this noob?
At this rate lebron will surpass malone in just 3 games
Jordon couldn’t do this at 37 in today’s league
I spent $700 on a ticket behind the lakers bench When they played against San Antonio. He didn’t play. And before and after that game on Monday he dropped 50 :(
LeBron played like he couldn't wait for Ramadan to be over so he could order a 50 piece nugget and a cold soda pop for the wash down.
Lenickel.
What a game for LeBron. Sadly, we all knows the next 6 games will be another L.
Wow so cool! Still 8 games under .500,  congrats! 😂
Westbrook looks like he is trying so hard to lose the game. He shot 18.2% FG in this game.
Another 50 pts from LeBron but nothing to celebrate bout the win coz it's only the slumping wizards
Bro they bullied the hell out of Kyle
immunity
God Bless and Take Care always everyone. Stay Healthy. Have a Blessed, Meaningful, and Productive Day:)  🍀Luke 18:1 "Always pray and never give up" ☘️ Jeremiah 31:25 NIV I will refresh the weary and satisfy the faint.”
I've been EXTREMELY blessed to have lived thru the 80's Showtime era feat Magic Johnson, the Shaq and Kobe late 90's early 2000's domination, then the Mamba takeover and now Lebron James. I mean seriously even tho this has been a down year for my Lakers, to watch what Lebron is doing is simply amazing!
Another night, another horrible Laker opponent.  Adam Silver tried to get LeBron to the playoffs.  Easiest schedule in NBA history.  Many college teams in history could beat this misfit Wizards squad
Kuzma revenge game
Lebron may have had the most points, but THT had the best highlights  2:58 8:05
Washington WIZARDS 109 vs 122 Los Angeles LAKERS
Bro the only chance they got if winning if lebron play like Cleveland style aka give him the ball and watch the show
Lol..Lakers sure do flex alot after losing the game before🤣
Fun fact: Lebron is currently leading the nba in scoring rn Bron: 29.71ppg Joel: 29.68ppg He’d be the oldest player to ever win a scoring title. How can anyone say this man isn’t the greatest player to ever pick up a basketball?😭🐐
Ma boi brodie bench again in 4th q
LBJ always seems to hate the Wizards since day one.
Lebron playing this way, at 37 multiple times this season. Actually crazy that these young guys can barley score or keep up on the lakers he has no help without AD and monk occasionally
Man the wizards had loccdown defense on westbric 5 pts but didn't double Lebron 👏🏾🔥😂
LeGoat
Leb - Advertisement - Bron!!!! dunks*
Not too bad for an old man!
Had to keep Russ on the bench for the 4th quarter about damn time
YEEEEEEEEEEESSIIRR damn long live the KING🔥🔥💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Wooowww.. Just woooowww.. Another 50 for the king😳😳😳..
He's thirty-seven years old and going for fifty!! Wow! How many thirty seven year old men do you know that can do what LeBron did tonight?
Another loss for the Tank…
Lakers sucks so much that LeBron needs to score 50+ to win a game.
Can't wait for LeDaddy to posterize Bronny
Can't tell me LeBron isn't better than MJ. NO WAY.
Wtf lebron
Lebron was definitely in his bag today
Skip after the rockets game: “LeBron is out of the goat conversation”  LeBron tonight: “hold my goddamn hairlines”
Lebron balling ✊🏾🔥
people calling him stat padder, you call a 37 yr old man scoring as much as he can to lift his team?, lmao, what do you want from him, who's gonna do it if he won't? Russ?? lmao
Takes 50 point games from Labron to overcome Rus. Westbrook is unplayable. 2 - 11 for 5 points. Only Starter not in double digits plus/minus
Westbrick got 5(pts) on it !
Westbrook with 5 points shooting 2/11. He’s really a special player. 🔥 🔥
Broo I really don't understand haters who never played ball who say lebron is trash lmao.
Still Jordan 💯👑🐐
They showed a Russ miss as a highlight lmao. He can't catch a break.
LeBron James is an assassin.
The King made my birthday so special..Thanks again!!! I didn't have money to celebrate it but I'm happy
LODI LEBRON👑
And then load management next. lol
The edits cut the logo shot from LBJ
Good news "LeBron scores 50"  Bad news"LeBron sits out the next game with knee soreness"
37 years old and getting a casual 50 points? Truly amazing
For some reason  I'm never satisfied when we beat A team when their best player or players are out.. with B Beal I would've took the W better.but we need every W
4:34 Westbrook went ultra instinct
LeBron James just need to drop 50 points every game to Win the Game🏀
Not surprised how great Lebron is. Wish the lakers played with this energy all year and seeing Kuz killing upsets me that Vogel came in here, benches him and kills his confidence. Glad Kuz found success else where and I can’t wait to the Lakers fire Frank Vogels lame ass. He’s such a horrible coach.
1 game winning streak let's go!! Lol
westbrook in 4th quarter 💺
Damn king bron still got it, fuck haters
Make it to the playoff!
It’s alright guys, russ had no expectations coming into tonight
👑 🤜🏿🤜🏿🤜🏿🤜🏿🤜🏿✨
I’m going to cry when he finally calls it quits …but for now let’s appreciate greatness
Lebron is great , for them to win he needs to get 50 like man he is 37 and they relaying on him. lakers down bad he can't do that everynight
Lebron tonight!👌🏾🔥
You can hate him all you want but you cant deny the fact that he is one of the greatest! KingLeBron! 🔥🔥
All I can say is Daaaaaammmmnnn Lebron!!
37 yrs old! Unreal🔥
Can we please see some more of this Lakers and ima #Knicks fan 😭😭
tht is such a ballhog. refuses to pass the ball no matter how stuck in traffic he is. it's sad to watch
This kind of energy wohhh. Lezgow playoffs
Its a good thing he dropped 50 so that noone notices Westbrick's 2/11 FG and his 5 points
Lebron's turn-around fadeaway is getting better and better.Wow.My Goat.👍
Russell Westbrook out there for some cardio
You know LBJ is a legend when he had a triple double and people called it a bad game 😁
Nothing new 🐐!
Well if Lebron could score 50 every game we would be undefeated! Instead we are almost 10 games under .500
Bron 37 years old and he's dropped back-to-back  50 points games at home & in year 19  one of the craziest stuff I'll  ever seen from an athlete   UNREAL 🔥🔥🔥
first player over 35 to have 2 50 point games
19 points in the 3rd quarter 14 in the 4th 50 for the game at 37 in  year 19 🔥
LEBRON GOES BACK 2018BRON
LeBron James & Russel Westbrook combined for an AMAZING 55 points🙌 The best duo in the league right now no doubt!💯💜💛
He Heard What Y’all Had To Say
Another 50-point game for LBJ, doing it all at age 37, good bounceback game for the Lakers🔥
Take that kuzma 😂😂😂
It’s a shame he has to drop 50 to beat the wizards at age 37. Teams needs to step it up
Stephen A Smith: “LeBron is gonna stop playing in April, he doesn’t care about winning”  Bron: “And I took that personally”
Lebron is not just at the top of the Panthenon statistically. He made his own Pantheon with himself as the only member of many categories. Production, consistency, efficiency, longevity. The youngest to do xyz, the oldest to do xyz.   No disrespect to Wilt or MJ, but Lebron has carved a niche in the annuls of NBA history that are just beyond anything we have ever or will ever see.   Win a couple more chips Lebron and you will be the 🐐
#LeGOAT no more debates. The only person who can beat this man is himself.
Good win for the Lakers.LeBron did his thing tonight.Congratulations team LeBron.
LeGOAT... but also give props to @kylekuzma for playing like a champ. Dude was getting a clinic put on him but he fought hard and smiled after. Good spirit.
Russ got benched and Bron closed the game out. Russ fans need to open their eyes.
Imagine losing to the worst team in the league
Another 50 points again for the Goat 🐐 King 👑 James
KING 👑 🔥
THT really screamed in Kuzs face the disrespectful at 9:16
The Lakers only ever win at home cause they get all the calls. LeBron was on fire tonight but calling him the goat for a 50 point game is laughable. Jordan has as many as LeBron and Kobe combined. Stop it.
Not to forget about lebrons great performance but man that spin and dunk by THT was so disgusting I was shook
As a Warriors fan im actually glad and happy to be witnessing Lebron at his age doing this since it’s never been done before, hope he can keep this up because what we are witnessing is greatness every night
What an absolutely insane athlete. Too bad you can’t just hobble together a team out of individuals, leaving them in like the 9th seed
LeBron is literally Kuzma's Dad
LeBron is still the best player in the league don’t care what anyone says, if the Lakers were a higher seed he’d be the MVP rn.💯 At the age of 37 he’s in the running to win a scoring title.
🤡james
Ok at this point even though I hate to say it because I would never try to tarnish/disrespect a player but I feel like this has to be said…..”can we please see just 1 game just 1 game without russ just to see what would happen “and yea I know it happened once but that was when melo was injured so when the bench was playing like ass there was nobody to score .now that melo is healthy I just want to see it even more so if AD was healthy .also when russ was benched he played well leading up to all-star break but now that he feels comfortable as a player I feel like vogol has to wake him up again
👎
Skip Bayless on heart attach now🤣😄
I heard unseld was a defensive coach,he's almost as bad as his dad was ( coach),
Watch my sports podcast channel for lakers post game breakdown
They bench russ in the 4th😂
And just like that, Bron made y'all forget that rockets game 2 days ago even happened. 🐐🐐
Best player alive 🐐 we witnessing greatness we gone miss it when he leave the court
THT is different. If he keeps playing like that we’ll make the playoffs. Lebron can’t do it all by himself.
FTC
LeBron is a top three player all time, we can have the goat debate all day but LeBron deserves top three if not top 2, just greatness.
Lebron is stepping into his next prime
50 burger take that
Lebron gets 50, lakers win. Will have a sore knee next game and the streak will end. I just hope they can hold their Play in spot.
Bron need 50+ points every game if he want won he's team 🤣😂🤣😂
Lebron should be a MVP candidate.
appreciate lebron while he’s here cuz he’s the greatest
Poor video editor 😂
50 taco 🌮 for king
Points in year 19: Kareem: 14ppg melo: 13ppg Stockton: 10.8ppg Tim Duncan: 8ppg Bron: 29ppg There’s levels👑
Lebron & Westbrick combined 55 tonight what a duo.
i don't see any troll comment or hate on LeBron here what a rare day
The same fans who booed him for having a bad game against the pelicans  Are cheering for him every time he dominates  Ironic🤣🐐
Russ and Lebron combined for 55 tonight
Wow at 37 years old, still going for 50 pts. He's an example of prime longevity.
Some great LeBron games recently
Dude Lebron literally looked like Curry out there with all them high arching shots and they just looked effortless, it’s crazy that he’s doing this at 37, just wish his team was better like imagine him doing this in the playoffs
Lebron is beast mode!!!.. keep it up Purple and Gold!!. Nice win!!.
Lebron!lebron!lebron!
What's amazing is he is playing with an injury..Bad knee.Small tear.He knows he has to play and dig deep or else they don't make the play in.
I fucks with bron!!! But we have to run off a win streak!! 50 don't mean much sitting near the bottom. Lakers let's go
Lakers looked good today
At this point would the Wizards even trade Kuzma back for Westbrook? smh
LeBron James: 50pts 7 Rebs 6 Asts
I can't help getting injured. i love the feeling of hospital beds
LeGoat Played Center/Point Guard!!!
The coach needs to bench westbrook for the rest of the season. He could've saved it if he did it 30 games earlier. Lebron and bunch of shooters is always a nice option until AD comes back.
7:51 kuzma :I know what he is gonna do .I know what he is gonna do I can stop him....oh Man!! how the hell that went in.
Imagine being a bron hater waiting for him to fall off But 19 years later he’s dropping 50 point games with ease I can’t imagine how much they suffer💀💀
Now lebron knows what curry feels last season. Carrying their trash team
Did you realize that if Lebron takes 20+ shot attempts a game, he can be a scoring champ every year?   LBJ averages 27pts on 19FGA. MJ has more scoring titles because he shoots way too much. 23FGA at least. There's also a season where MJ shot 27FGA.   LBJ scored 56pts on 31 shots. Today, he scored 50pts on 25 shots. VERY EFFICIENT SCORER. Imagine if LBJ shoots 20-25FGA a game. He would average 35-38pts.
Not only did LeBron drop fifty tonight, but he looked very efficient in going about it. Do you know how hard it is to look efficient when going for 50? LeBron went 18-25 from the field and 6-9 from 3. Crazy stats!
Russ and Lebron combined for 55 points btw nice W😅
Why coach Wes always putting kuzma back in the game with only 7 minutes remaining.
Thanks Lebron for sending most of the haters back in their shells. I’m getting sick of all this slander on here. 😂
Man Lebron 50 pts Omg The man's a beast let's beat the sun's and let's make the playoffs
Lefity
“ They say this a big rich town!” - 50
This nigga Lebron is a straight Machine, a fucking Unit 💪🏽
Welcome to the LeBron James show ladies and gentlemen.
LEGOAT JAMES AGAIN!!!
Damn Russ is washed, can't even make layups now
How many more 50 points games gets them into the playoffs ?👨🏾‍🦯🗣
LeBron is the King of Carrying A Team!!!
Lakers starting their 1 game winning streak again I bet my house on it
Man I sure do love them street clothes
I’m glad I was alive and of age to witness and appreciate what Bron is doing at 37 is just spectacular wow🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Home win against the Wizards...😒👏🤷🏻‍♂️...
I sure don't want to hear what Stephen A Smith has to say after this performing the King. put on 2night lol
LeGOAT
LeBron literally cruises and get 50 like it’s to easy for dis man 🐐shit
LeBron pulling a Dame, dropping a 50 piece again after bad game the other night...but it's weird anyone doubts LBJ is a killer, more than Dame and any active player in playoffs easy...most game winners in playoff history at one of the highest%, highest ppg in elimination games or king of game 7, etc Narratives...
Eventually he'll drop 60
Lebron + the kids is the Lakers best lineup 🔥
I always say this about LeBron, we will never see anyone as durable and as good as LeBron at his age ever again we are blessed to say that we're able to watch this man play
Dallas for sure won that trade, Tingus Pingus Trash! LOL! good game bron.
This man LeBron really is something else 🐐
LET ME FORESHADOW WHATS TO COME…  NEXT GAME: LEBRON GAME MANAGEMENT. THEY LOSE BIG. LOSING STREAK STARTS AGAIN.
LeGoat went absolutely crazy this game‼️🐐 50 points( 2nd time in the same week)💯 18-25(72% fg)🔥 6-9 3pt(67%)🎯 8-8 ft😈 22 +/-🧠 Mj wasn’t ever built like this. Bron truly is the greatest👑
Lakeshow
Le bron is 2 assist shy of getting 10k points 10k rebounds And 10 k assists,the only NBA player to do it long live Idol!!
Great win. Bron cannot or should not have to keep this pace up to get wins tho.
🐐🐐
Twice in one week!!!!????? WHHATT TTTHHHEE FUFUUUHHHH!!! TTWIICCEE!!???? What IS this man!!!!!
G.O.A.T.
Still way ayu si Lebron
wild that kuzma is on the thumbnail pic vs LeBron
Final score: Refs(Brandon, Cackling Kamala, and Silver put magnets in the ball) 122, Wiz comeback 109
LBJ is a great player. Maybe lots of people didn't appreciate his greatness but for me at that age totally dominated the game then he's totally great
ALL HAIL THE KING 👑
Bron literally got to drop 50 for a win these days...😳
LeGoat
Great game crowd really loved it all
Le50
SPIN and dunk by THT was nasty!
Another 50 point game🤯
Oh my 50pts at his age
LeOat
LeBron James is the first player in NBA history with multiple 50-point games after turning 35.
Why does a 37Yr old guy has to play the most minutes. Every single game !!!!! Give the guy a break....he's 37..37..3777777..  Westbrook please play worth the money you getting paid.
LEBRON STILL THE BEST IN THE WORLD AT NEAR 40
4th Quarter was on fire these youngster plus the King is super fun to watch.so much movement around..i want to see more of these game.i always want it to see this 5 player play Malik,reaves,Johnson,Talen and James.awesome!!! now i can finally go to sleep.
Seeing Russ score less than 10 multiple times this year really shows how impressive bron record Of 1,000+ games of 10+ points scored really is
It's sad it takes a 37 yr old to drop 50 for them to win.
LeBron caught fire today after Houston mess.
Is he really 37 yrs old? Dang Lebron dropping another 50pt game
Crazy but true: LeBron James is now leading the league in scoring.   29.71 — LeBron 29.68 — Embiid 29.66 — Giannis
Leunder .500
LeBron James tonight:  50 Points 7 Rebounds 6 Assists 72% FG 6/9 3PM  KING JAMES. 👑👑👑
Even haters be rooting for lakers to win and make playoffs comfortably. Lakers are fun to watch be it win or losse.
Had to Rewatch THC crossover
IF the Lakers win the Finals this year Lebron james is the goat no question.
YOU LAKER STANS WAS JUST BOOING THIS MAN A LITTLE WHILE AGO.🤣🤣🤣
LeBron now has 2 games of scoring 50+ points this season.  Last Laker to have 2+ 50-point games in a single season: Kobe Bryant (07-08)
Center lebron😐😐😐
Kuzma seems frustrated carrying the wizards.
True Laker fans watch the highlights after the game is finished.
It's sad to think that LeBron has to score 50 just for them to win.
At age 37 ❤️💯🔥
Lmao LeBron ignored Westbrook after he scored 50 points.😂
Last Game Bashed this Game we’re witnessing greatness smh 🤦🏽‍♂️
Who win?
Amazing win for Lakers 🔥. ngl It's a shame that a 37 year old has to score 50+ to carry the team though.
😂😂50 points on 25 shots. So if he took 50 shots, he’d have dropped about 100. Bron out here exposing Brick-Boy gimmicks.
APPRECIATE LEBRON BEFORE HES GONE TWO 50 POINT GAMES IN 1 WEEK AT 37 IN YEAR 19
Lebron could do this every game, he just happens to be the greatest passer of all time also so…
Lebron is trying to play like these young kids.. I don't like this high tempo basketball.. The old, patient LeBron needs to comeback...
I hope everyone appreciates Lebron while it last. There’s never been another 37 year old no where near this good!
Man lebron is just a role model fr
Few things of note: LeBron was built in a damn lab Lmao. Westbrook will definitely do better with a new team next season and I hate to say it……… Carmelo is washed man. His entire career he’s never been a good defender but his offense always took up for that but now he’s just so inconsistent it’s getting bad
LeBron James is the KING of the ENTIRE WIZARDS FRANCHISE!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
LEBRON IN THE GOAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
50 points at 37 is nice
Average Lakers fan: Lebron scores 56: Goat🐐 Lebron shoots 34% next game: this is why Kobe is better Lebron scores 50 again: he's 37 MJ could never
Lebron is 50 points 7reb 6ast 18-25 field goal
LeBron James Stat's Line 👑🔥🏀 50 Points (2nd 50 Pts. Gms. this Season) 6 Assists (2 Shy from 10000 Careers Assists) 7 Rebounds 1 Blocks 18 - 25 FG (.72%) 6 - 9 3PT (.66%) 8 - 8 FT (.100%)
LeBron and Russ combined for 55🔥
2 50 point games in a week in year 19? One of the craziest stuff I’ve ever seen from an athlete.
Who is Lebron James? To the blind, he is the light. To the hungry, he is bread. To the sick, he is the cure. To the lonely, he is company. To the sad, he is joy. To the prisoner, he is freedom. For the poor, he is treasure. For me, he is everything.
Westbrook trick y’all, just running around doing nothing.
LeBron may jump high in the MVP rankings if Lakers get the Dub against the Suns!
Lebron James on fire again another 50pt game 🔥
We ain’t contenders because we don’t have Jared Dudley anymore. He’s the real mvp.
Shannon gonna be waiting for Skip at the studio… 😂
pers
The only way Lakers are winning is Lebron scoring 50  ,feel kinda bad
Lebron Dropping 50 wing chicken dinners at 37 years old ! 🐐🐐
Ey let's gooo
Malik Monk’s stat line: 21 points 3 rebounds 4 assists
Lebron owed his team this win after costing them the Rockets game. Now onto Phoenix...than the Raptors than the Timberwolves than the Raptors again. This is gonna get ugly again real quick
Should’ve kept last years roster, would’ve been contenders right now. Remember where LA were in the standings before all of those injuries. Now wasting these performances.
Still happy for kuz in Washington to have a fresh start he can't exceed the expectations in LA.
LeBron James’ stat line: 50 points 7 rebounds 6 assists
37 and he's dropped back-to-back 50-point games at home.
37 Years old Lebron James But score 50Points Awesome man!!!! This man is desserve another ring in L.A 🤔

LeBron James is the 5th Laker with 3 or more 50-point games :  - LeBron (3×) - Mikan (4x) - West (5×) - Baylor (17×) - Kobe (25×)
*Most 30 Point Games in 19th season*  27 - LeBron James 7 - Kobe Bryant 1 - Jamal Crawford  That’s all
Another 50 point game from the 👑
Lebron is the greatest basketball player of all time
