How crazy is it that this happened twice in the last couple of months?!
If these were left in for 5000 miles would the pulls break off ?
Like these the most in red.  Like an old AMG race car.
Those are 200 years old
unbelievable....what great customer service from the dealership....
Why in earth didn’t you take this up with the mercedes stealership?
boffington boff and the boffington boffs of boffington.
Nice touch that they colour match the suspension packing pieces to the seatbelts.
So muppets work at the AMG dealership - even bright yellow colour doesn't register - unbelievable.
✋🇫🇷🙏🍀🙏👍👍👍
My 2018 GTI was delivered to my wife with blocks in one side only, on a holiday weekend. By the time I drove it I think permanent damage had occurred.  The dealer replaced a strut bearing and on a second trip the strut but the clunk remains.  According to the dealer, VW says this is "normal."  So, this is my first---and last--- VW product.
if it happens on an Electric motor
Sam reminds me of Brian from Kansas!
Why didn’t you confront the dealer about this oversight? Instead you take the car to a tuner shop and remove the blocks yourself, thus absolving the dealer from whatever happens next. If the car experiences a major malfunction, the dealer will have this video as evidence of the car being worked on by a non-MB shop. Good luck with future warranty claims! For a so-called auto journalist, you are green as grass when it comes to purchasing a car and dealing with issues.
Crazy oh ok mr de ja  vu Amg not happy
Don’t know why you would protect such an unprofessional sorry dealership. If they are that miserable with millionaires cars like you how bad are they screwing normal people? Call them out so others can be warned...
I'm impressed how a little piece of plastic can endure that much car going down on it without exploding
It’s good to see you guys together
Next time, please get the shmee off the windscreen~
Sorry but not to be rude  I’m finding it little bit hard to believe Mercedes dealer didn’t remove transport blocks at PDI. Covid is no excuse apologies however standards are standards this is top end marquee car ..I mean blocks are luminous yellow you can’t miss them  it badly effects the suspension set up..plus ride quality so much surely you’d pick up on this in hrs days weeks and not months ? Why didn’t you return car and complain to dealer unusual practice these days ? I would have in a flash..especially taking the price tag into account ..you’ve not mentioned this at any point I recall in your content  ..Sir ? 😂
You removed with remarkable technique and outstanding panache. You are now thoroughly certified by AMG as suspension technician. LoL 😂 cheers 🥂
That is dreadful service from the main dealer that sold the car! ☹️
I think this is shocking on the dealerships part.
the person who responsible for the PDI definitely didn't do his/her job properly
I think you got a problematic car
I'd love to know what the dealership have said. Shoddy
Where did Schmee got the money from to afford these cars. ? Anybody an idea?
Sam: Gets a display area for his cars  Tim: Hold my beer
Makes you wonder what else they don't check when doing the PDI, i bet they checked how fast it went though !! hope the halfwit who signed it off has a proper talking too for doing half a job, total whopper of a bloke
That is shocking PDI prep!!
Where do you live Shmee150 and we can meet you
Truly, a first world problem.  Wish I was in a position to have the same issue.  Enjoy the heck out of it, Tim!
At 5.40 when you remove the transport blocks, you should do a design on them and do a little giveaway 😉 love the videos and your constant grind! ❤ P.s they look like pacman
I’d heard PAC-Man was trying to make a come back but I didn’t think being smuggled in exotic Mercedes Cars would be the best way to get attention….  I guess I was wrong 😁🤪🤣🤦🏻‍♂️
Nice car
Not enough twiggy content
I almost forgot you owned this! What a stunning car!
4:55 when the mechanic is removing the wheel without a removal pin (or two) makes my teeth itch... then he bounces the wheel off the disc for good measure.
I forgot you even have this car
Better hope the body attachments aren't damaged if you drove it. What a shower.
Mercs used to be over enginered now theyre made by acountants
Wow Shmee getting his hands dirty?
Name and Shame the dealer! Very dangerous what they did, and charged a grand for delivery? Expensive car wash...typical
That’s quite appalling that they were not removed at PDI...makes you wonder how many car’s don’t get checked
Mercedes & BMW= The biggest pieces of crap on the road. If you have money to flush down the toilet on these two car brands (while looking sporty doing it) God bless.
Yeah PDI..... quick glance over by a jobs worth and it’s done. It’s a real shame that attention to detail and care for the job in hand is rare these days.
How embarrssing of Mercedes!
Why not just take it to the Mercedes dealer?
I had that happen on a new car once and I didn't discover it until I went on a track day! TBH .. the handling may have been improved due to the reduced suspension travel! lol
Shmee we miss the SLS amg…
Every new AMG comes with a book about a plucky Spanish boy called MANUEL. You should read it.
we need more amg gt r content
wow, I better check my 2009 nissan for some suspension blocker
After it happened on the GT 500 I thought that you had encountered a rare and strange thing that must never happen, but this now makes me think it must be a semi common thing
great content as always
Its driver?
“WTF”🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
Top
That should have been removed during pre delivery inspection
Didn't you JUST go thru this with the GT500?
Is it just me that didn’t know he took delivery of this car 😂
Such a great looking car but the two tone wheels are ‘orrible, really let it down
Well done Merc,whats a pre inspection cost???
thanks for sharing
Laughed at the Pontiac with an AMG badge. There's a rash of those fake AMG badges in the US especially as the things cost $12 a set on eBay. I wanted to tick off my friend with a real AMG so put two badges on my Chrysler 300 (which was a Daimler-Chrysler product): AMG Black Series with V12 Bi-Turbo below it. Now every fool on the block comes up and wants to race me. My Hemi is tuned a bit so I actually have a shot.
Eric Davidich is right about Mercedes!
Loved the bit with Sam! It's always a delight seeing either of you OG's (especially STG/Sam and/or MrJWW James) cross paths!
It's like full sticker Rolex, shouldn't happen, but happens
Hi Tim, first of all I want you to know that I am the only one from from Sri Lanka who's been watching your channel since 2019 along with the only other two who I've subscribed to - (Harrys Garage and RBR,) who really give 61 year old petrol-heads like me clear, unabaised, detailed information about the new vehicles on the market. I'm really disappointed that Mercedes did not do a proper pre-delivery inspection of the car before giving it to you. The reason being that I am a Mercedes fan since 1971 when dad (a automobile engineer who worked in Dagenhem for Ford in the the 60's and bought his first car, a 3 speed Ford Prefect and drove it with mum and me overland back to Sri Lanka , and not to be bored in his years as a pensioner, bought a 1952 DB190 that was a restauration project over the next 4 years with me, a 11 year old, as his helper, handing over diverse tools to him that he needed when he was restoring this maroon with a cream top dream car. Just so you know, for me, although all cars that you have are beautiful pieces of work,this AMG Cabrio is MY favourite!  I've watched the delivery video 7 times already. Keep up the incredible, sadly, not daily, new posts. Lots of greetings from sunny Sri Lanka to you and your girlfriend, Stay Healthy. Keith.
Since when Shmee bought the AMG GTR Roadster?
04:58 it drove me nuts. Hurts me badly.
Was it PDI in the UK?  That would answer the question “why”?  British mechanics dealing with Germany engineering.  British mechanics can’t even keep up with British engineered cars let alone something as “foreign” as German.
It’s the equivalent of leaving the steel retaining rod in place on a washer or dryer, lmao
When’re we going to see the new shmooseum
So when something like this happens, do you bill the transport company for the service done to get this off?
Just a little viewer observation. When you record in the garage, the background ventilation is rather annoying and loud. Just my opinion 🤷‍♂️ Besides that, Thank you for all the great content 😊👏
👍
I had a similar problem with my washing machine.
his video brings to me a lot of memories I spent working day and night just to make a living. βͲC becoming more appealing to investors seeking low-correlation assets that diversify portfolios. The reason why people don't know they can buy a fraction of a βͲC is that nobody talks about it. I agree with all your points, nobody knows where βͲC will go, That’s why I bring to you my great mentor who laid a great foundation for me by putting me through. IN order for too much long talk I will advice to check out my discussion I have something exciting for you..
I don't believe you
I hope the shear embarrassment of this video towards the dealership will make them ensure they envoke the predelivery inspection as they must charge their customer for?
I'm sure you'll speak on it soon, but do you plan on chasing an allocation for the 812 competizione? @shmee150
Can we please just get all the cars together jeezus I’ve lost track.
Tim and Sam are literally the perfect pair lol
I’d be having a fairly interesting conversation with the principal of the supplying dealership, were this to happen to me…….
The potential consequence of leaving those in - is huge.   That's an item that should be on a checksheet, and signed off individually.
They may have left them in there thinking you would have it sent on a truck to get ppf wrapped before actually driving it,but forgot to tell you they left them in.  Honest mistake I'm sure
Is that a standard colour Tim. I like it
👍
My god, Tim started working on his own cars, whats happening to the world?
Best color though 😍
8:15 the most pointless pieces of sounddempening 😂
that parking garage is soooo ugly. please get a real one
You would think big dealerships did a PDI before...
A lot of "sack the inspector, punish the dealership" comments from people who obviously have never made a mistake in their lives. Chill.
I think thats absolutely terrible that this wasnt spotted on the PDI! Really really poor!
OMG that Twiggy is cute <3
Investing in c.rypto now should be in every wise individuals list, in some months time you'll be ecstatic with the decision you made today.
Make sure you check the spacers when you take delivery of the black series
4:59 dropping the rim on the brake rotor made me sigh. For my SL R231 with ceramic rotors, I bought wheel guiding pins to avoid this exact issue.
Wheels on gtr 🤮🤮🤮🤮
Just ridiculous...
Hi Tim, you should contact the dealership and explain what they had missed on the PDI and make sure all PDI work has been completed correctly and to Mercedes spec as they have taken the money from the finance company so they need to ensure the car is 100% ready for collection as they had the car for long enough prior to collection. In my opinion it’s simply not good enough when you spend north of £100k Best Wishes Alan B 👍
Tim is very diplomatic in his words regarding the dealership’s attention to detail. Is this the same dealership he purchased the G Wagon, GTR Pro and soon to be delivered GTR Black? If so, I would be taking my business elsewhere or having a serious discussion with the dealership principle
Why didn’t you take it Mercedes and let rip with an Exocet at them?
Excuse the silly question, but why not take it back to the Mercedes garage and have them do it? I appreciate that it's a really quick fix.
I wonder if anything would have been mentioned by the dealer at the first service.  Hmmm!?
Shmee acting like he is diffusing a bomb when he pulls the plugs out 🙊
Hmm
You've got to be kidding! I wonder what else they missed during PDI?
You want to fire that car back into the dealership that delivered it, I'd only be happy with new  shocks and springs. That's a dangerous situation really
Shmee is a very unusual young man
When is the reveal of the Shmeuusiom
Do you think AMG or Mercedes will reach out to you? Really wondering what their procedure is when this happens, and especially with a person who has so much reach on the online platforms.
kudos to Mercedes
Cumoon who did your PDI??? Who signed this off????
I feel like this is the vehicle equivalent of walking around with the shop tag still on your T shirt.
Hello Shmee and greetings from Athens, Greece ! Why did you go to Duke of London and not the official Mercedes AMG dealer? After all it's their fault! Honestly a childish mistake for a brand  like this...
6:08 is that brake hose not sitting in the bracket!?
OMG
OK for now on you need to check it with all your other coming cars as well ! Great though to see the AMG GT Roadster back on the channel.
Not good for Mercedes not to check this very poor
Thanks for visiting! Twiggy already misses you
jst wanna say, ITs just something amazing to see your videos everyday !!!! so wanna seee you do something which you usually dont do bt maybe an insane widebody modification of some car in ur channel ?
Is it really for that car won't bottom out under transport? Sounds weird can it even bottom out and hit inner fenders and front bumper without them? I think the struts prevent that already.  I'am thinking more like to reduce bouncing for the truck hauling them. Just imagen havin 10 cars bouncing, the trailer would start bouncy more than nesencery.
We want more collabs with the OG crew plz .
#Shmee150Shquad
That is a beautiful color! The lack of noise it makes seems hardly an issue. At some point you might enjoy having a more personal garage, perhaps a little bit more in the countryside . A parking structure type garage seems limiting.
Those transport blocks will be a good decoration for Shmuseum!
Seems like they are not up to the job... As the mechanic pulled of the first wheel, he hit the brake disc with the wheel. A carbon fibre disc could get serious damage from that. Maybe search for Mercedes Benz dealer who isn't located in the rough parts of town.
Who says Shmee doesnt work on his own cars?🤣
What about the rear wheels ??
who are these bozo dealers who cant verify this. What a joke
Yawn. You complain about problems and you spent more on that car than a lot of people spend for five years of groceries for their families? Ya, and I'm IMPRESSED.  Wait and watch.
Dealerships suck, does not matter what level of car purchase
Some garages might say you need a whole suspension system Lool
Hey Tim. Maybe a stupid question but in this case would you ask/expect Mercedes to reimburse the labour costs for that ?
You should start a suspension block collection maybe make some artwork I think they’ll be more!
How many cars do you have at the moment? More then 100 cars :-)!?
If dealerships can’t do the job right for a car this expensive, for a customer with this high a profile, what chance do the rest of us have. This is embarrassing for the dealership to put it mildly.
Well now this has just gotten silly with these transport blocks.🤣
19:10.  Bravo, well said. I equally believe this should be stressed if not enforced on every new vehicle. Come time to exchange ownership of vehicle to another owner Id hate to know my piston rings did not seat well. Cheers.
I knew that was gonna be the problem.
Well not all was right😕 Should be on a check list maybe?
Sam is such a good genuine guy, and makes excellent content
Sabotage? I hope not. Get those cars safely parked in the Shmuseum!
Love the color!
I drove around for 4 months with them still on my ZL1 Camaro before I noticed... Yes great inspection dealership
You are a truly entertaining person to watch. Thank you for working so hard to make good content.
Did the technician smack the inner edge of the wheel against the rotor when taking it off? That's what it looked and sounded like.
Sad this car isn’t driven more
Same thing happened to me on my M3.  The ride was brutal unti they took them off.
I read on a Mercedes club website that not removing that suspension transport blocks is a common issue with dealers.
Me: takes one look at badge on front....oh I think I'll believe it
When u we’re showing a car that had a AMG badge on it. You said a Pontiac   I believe it was a Chevy Nova.
Shmee, I’ve had 2 of my new Volvo’s in the last 6 years delivered (after dock and dealership prep) with the shipping blocks in.  Infuriating!  No excuse for the dealership to miss them.
The best UK car Youtuber and Tim. Big fan of Sam and his content. Such a genuine and authentic man who produces properly high quality content.
I genuinely forgot you even owned this lol.
I would send  the dealer the bill for this....
That’s a Chevy nova Shmee 👍
Why didn’t you go back to Mercedes to correct this? I’m sure they would have been very concerned that the car was delivered in that condition. A shame because it s such a nice car.😱😬🙂🙂🙂
OMG...I can't believe he bought that Car 4 years ago. Where does the time go?
Without pucks, should sit lower.  Pucks for shipping.
How the hell does the Dealership miss that??
This happened with my car also. And it took a year to realize
What else did your dealer miss? You probably should find a new one.
I had that happen to my Evo X as well, delivery blocks still installed 😒 I drove from DC to Florida and took the wheels off to paint the Brembos Verde Ares and sure enough it was still on. Pretty frustrating.
Nice to see you and Sam collaborate.  Kind of reinforced how talented Sam is at making a space look great.  His video vs your video was like seeing the set in the play vs a candid look at the set.  Sam was a little star struck to be with the master YouTuber.    Sadly made for an awkward interaction.   I would hope collaboration with SHMEE150 would help his channel.  His spectacular video presentation deserves a more substantial following.  I think this just diminished it.  Maybe this lack of confidence is the whole problem. I say this not to knock Sam but to encourage him to buck up.  This was an opportunity and Sam's stunning lack of confidence threw an opportunity out the window.  You can learn from this Sam.  I learned early to fake it till you make it.  It works.  Just do it.
TWIGGY, *BITE!*
Unacceptable! Goes to show the morons that are working in these so called high end garages.
I believe it.  Mercedes Benzs are moneypits.
How long have you been driving around like that for? It can cause real problems when there driven on.
Lol im confused. Why not just take it back to the dealer and tell them to take it off? Rather than a personal garage and pay more
Now how many others will you check, just to make sure?
4:58😬
Why didn’t you front the dealer and get them to fix it?
How many cars you have bro love you from india 😘
I can't believe how unreliable Mercedes are!  My friends and family have owned numerous Mercs over the years and it seems like, they are just getting worst!! Feels like they only care about how flashy they can make their interior with all their ambient lights
get your pdi refunded
This oversite made great video content. First time I have ever seen this problem.
Yea, Shmee I wouldn’t confess to this one.
I hope you kept the transport blocks as a momento to have in the new garage as part of the story of the car.
Did I hear it right? Sam has had the 360 for 4 years already???? omg
How could this be the second time Shmee!?
STG! Those poor thighs. Man he slaps his legs a lot.
Great car! 04:58, any damage to the wheel?
Not sure why you wouldn't take this back to the dealership and get them to explain how this was missed and reperform the PDI
Well good job you didn’t have an accident,very poor service from Mercedes it’s a disgrace, specially with such a high-performance car more care should have been taken
You're having no luck with that eye my friend dang thing won't go away 😅
fyi I used to work at ford and leaving those on is a massive safety concern and you should actually get some money back for it
SHMEEE! The Sabre from Triple F is currently at the shop where I work and when I saw it I nerded out cuz I knew you drove it! When I have to inspect it I'll be freaking out so much haha! Big fan of yours, keep it up🙏
Love STG, he's the embodiment of " happiness " 👊🏼🎃👊🏼 ( edit ) go on a Gumball with STG, just you two, it'd be so good to chill to and forget the world that's gone mad 🌎  Yo, TIM !!! HOW COULD YOU NOT STROKE THE LITTLE PUPPER ?!?!?! LOL 🐶
Who would've thought pacman on your suspension could cause that much trouble!
I’d be curious to know if you talk to the dealers about this and if they’re apologetic
This kind of thing should never happen as the PDI would require them to be removed, would worry me what else they haven't inspected.
Such a great car
Love the roadster why not bring it to Merc to take those yellow things off let’s hope they don’t cancel any warranty on the car
I'm curious whether you drive the other AMG GT as much since you got this and the SLS Black Series.
I am going to buy one of these. Maybe gray
Tim, did you say 180Nm for the torque on the front wheel nuts????  that seems excessively high.
Only Shmee can say, “take things from theare and get away
The AMG GTR looks amazing in that red colour with the yellow callipers!😍
A simple job and he can’t even do it himself 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
I think it's due to the bird poop on your windshield.
Hey Tim, can you make a video on your Ninebot Segaway GoKart
You got me checking my suspension now lol.
The gt 500 was delivered to you with it's transport blocks still put in and now the Amg gtr roadster same thing. Who would've guessed?
They may not have pre-delivery check in UK ! Should de done with the overall at the workshop ! Check the oil level too,  I recon !
Will yall do more videos with the whole gang again
Sorry to sound harsh but this is total negligence on behalf of Mercedes-Benz Brentford. It the dealer cannot get this right what else on the PDI was missed? Just awful service. Really the car needs to be back to a dealer for a qualified technician to complete a PDI. That is one fine pair of cars that STG is showing off. Nice to see his set up from a different angle. Thank you.
you should put this sealer on blast this is totally unacceptable and people should know to go else where
Can’t stand stg. His and sol channels are so past it
I always feel bad that I don't watch more of Sam's videos.
Niente carboceramici? Barbone.
Vote for NDL
some lazy pdi technicians lol
Just buy a hecking microphone Tim! Sound quality is terrible in buildings...
Mercedes-Best
I would go back to the dealership, as if I forgot to remove those what else could they have possibly forgotten when doing the PDI. Either way it’s not acceptable for any dealership yet alone Mercedes with an AMG product.
I winced when the fella banged the wheel on the brake calliper 😱
Transport blocks = Memorabilia for the Shmuseum 😉😉 Glad this was this simple with no damages.
Watching Tim remove the suspension blocks is the same gratifying feeling of finally removing a popcorn kernel from between your teeth.
Sam saying “I’ve enjoyed it” when referring to the 996. Talking like it’s sold or for sale.
Think you need to walk up to the service desk as the MB dealer and just say that those have fallen off my car and see what they say.
Reminds me of the splitter guard on Dodges.  These just add space in the suspension?  For s little clearance to be loaded onto a trailer?  If so, that's a clever design.
I thought it was an outer tie rod in the thumbnail.  I was worried, those going out is a severe problem.  Glad to see it was a much simpler fix.
That dealership is going to get a right roasting from Mercedes HQ ...
I can hear the sound of a Mercedes technician being fired as I type. Possibly the worst customer in the UK to make this mistake with. 😬
Ridiculous issue
I can understand this happening with the GT500 considering the way you have taken the delivery of it but this is just unacceptable. A merc dealer missing such a simple step of the pdi?!?! One wonders what else they have also missed with that pdi.
You'd think Merc would want to know, as it's poor service from the dealer. Makes you wonder if they checked anything?....
I hope the company that did the PDI are holding their head in their hands in embarrassment.
Technically you should replace the front left brake disc. Could be dameged by hitting the wheel on it
So sad to see how bad the quality of these cars going down hill as well as the dealerships servicing them.   This should never happen period!!
So the Mercedes said   "Kaput!!"
And Mercedes then reached out to Tim, apologized profusely and returned the $2,845.00 cost of his PDI which was obviously incompetently performed.      Not
Does he still own the Lusso?
Hope your car gets well soon 😂👍🏻
An amazing video as always 👍🏻
Takes to Merc Dealer: That'll be $5000 for service. See you back here in two months for more!
I hope that the AMG dealer has been suitably chastised for the quality of their PDI work Tim?! Given the number of subscribers you have, surely they realise the negative publicity this would cause them?
SCHMEE:Lets pickup my new car after a PDI HOOVIE:I'll wait until there has been a few PDI's
I can't wait for the AMG GT Black series and I can't wait to see it in Topaz Skin with Solar beam yellow because I hope you do Topaz Skin and not just a wrap!
The thumbnail looks like Shmee is proposing to the GTR roadster 😂😅
I would love to see the Merc. wrapped yellow!
Do dealers have a check-list for removing things like this when they get delivered to them? If so, are they ignoring them?
Are you sending these, now famous block, to a lucky subscriber?
Perhaps, they should put a long flag on the blocks so that you can’t drive off without this procedure. Oops. They did that.
That's quiet shocking actually, makes you wonder what else they missed or didn't do.
Shmee, Sam and Marc Priestly would make a great Top Gear trio.
OMG! How are you going to get to the grocery store!
Glad you got it sorted out quickly! Definitely makes you wonder what else they may have missed during the PDI.
Anyone else thought the title was related to the Taycan???
Love from Melbourne 😘🇦🇺🇦🇺😘
so it was number Two
Absolutely disgraceful pdi from a Mercedes dealer Just goes to show they don't check the car over
Definitely would make me go back to the dealership and have them do a full PDI, depending on what's required. If they missed something like this, what else could have been missed?
The car would def being getting taken back to Mercedes. Not duke of London. With your repeat custom history and this happens. Hell no
That's a sackable error and actually against the law to allow a car you've worked on to go out with them still fitted... 😒
It doesn't matter how long the car has been at the dealer, this is unacceptable and there are zero excuses for this to happen!
Owww dear
Son of Ronald Koeman 😆
KERRRRRKIING!!!!  Vehicle unsafe for daily use, sue 'em.
Since you about to get the Black Series I say get rid of all the AMG's you have 😅😬🤷‍♂️
I dont understand why you dong go to a official mercedes dealer
did you call the dealer and tell them?
That's pretty poor show from Mercedes
Harmless oversight, but like.. come on guys. Makes you wonder how often that slips by and people don’t notice
Next time you take off the wheels on a car with carbon ceramic brakes, use long threaded studs (every car brand has their own ‘special tool’) to keep the wheel centered and not hit the rotors when sliding them off. Otherwise it can chip and damage the very expensive ceramic brake rotors
You should stick with BMW 😀😀😀
Can’t believe dealer let you drive out like that when you received the car.
Surely them blocks would of been dangerous if not found 🤔
Sad that the YouTube algorithm meant we only get a few of these  colabs now.
Lol, that's crazy that's happened to you twice in a few months... you should mail those back to the dealership..... lol
Not Again!!!
It looks like he realized his mistake and the next rim was nice and smooth,,, it shows you how unprofessional they are even at expensive so called high-end places,,,
How much f-ing money does this a-hole have?  Every day hes got a new exotic car
That bugs me when they bang the inside of the rim off the brake assembly as they take it off the car,,, I noticed that happens almost every time you get something done with your wheels they bang the rim,,,!,,, I guess that's what happens when you have young kids working because the owner of the shops don't want to pay for experienced technicians,,,
Pure bullshit from Mercedes! Nothing gonna happen to the suspension during transport, even over the ocean! And the dealership should have known about this at the time of delivery! Thats why i'm always gonna choose BMW! 😉
You taking about the 'break-in' period jogged a memory from back in the early '90's at Daytona where I was talking to a Suzuki rep and asked him about the 'break-in' and what was up with it.   I'd always had my suspicions that with modern engines they really don't need much time for everything to seal and wear in otherwise they'd not be able to pass emissions.   The Suzuki rep said, to paraphrase "the engine is ready to run right out of the box.   The oil temps will be a tad higher until everything settles in but otherwise you can run it as you please.  The 'break-in' is for the rider...to give them time to get used to the bike in gradual increments so hopefully they won't bin it."   I think the automobile 'break-in' is similar....diff temps will be a tad higher as the gears lap in but otherwise it's good to go..it's the new driver they're trying to 'break-in' mostly.   Probably a great idea to follow the guidelines on modern cars because they have recording within the ECU that could cause you a problem with warranty should an issue arise.   Better to be safe than having to pay for an engine.   Good video Shmee!
that is the most amount of manual labour Shmee has ever done.  I would have marched back to the dealer who sold you your car and raised sh!t, or get part of your PDI back.  Duke of London garage looks like a dump
16:03 OMG the colour on that defender is amazing !!
Great video Shmee! Just wondering, are you wishing you had waited and got the taycan cross turismo, or are you happy with your current one? Of course there was no way of knowing about the cross turismo when you collected yours
GR8 to see Sam on your channel. Brilliant Guy with superb utube posts.
I hope one day I can pull out suspension blocks
What a disgrace Mercedes-Benz
I've got that bookshelf in STG's studio in mine. Well the 4x4 version. Love it and great for displaying memorabilia.
i would be outraged if that was my car - and I certainly would make  the dealer aware of their ineptitude.
I work for a Ford Dealership when the Focus ST came out in 2018 the first batch that came hadnt had the blocks put in at the factory and they had all been scraped really badly on the front bumper
Crazy crazy fault ! Is this also bottas his problem ??
Very pretty car, Tim. I'm looking forward to post run in driving clips.
Sam is so annoying
when u said deja vu i thought this got in a fender bender in the garage too... PHEW!
Shmee glad all is sorted and nothing serious, I just bought a c63 amg an the engine is a master piece😀👍
1st world problems....
Thank you Shmee, greatly appreciate the positive collabs; Burlacher rocking your cheers shirt, that's a nice touch 👍
Would never buy again from that dealership
Technician damaged paint on your wheel, when he removed wheel he hit brake disc or calliper. Sorry for bad news.
Didn't even need to take the wheels off. Could just jack the car up and come in from inside the wheel. Wondering what they charged him for this? lol
Unbelievable how cool you are Tim I would not be happy at all 😡😡😡
Hi Schmee do you still own the M8 competition
I would have though a phone call to Mercedes-Benz,  "get here quick and sort my bloody car out" would have been in order! I had a new car last September,  had to keep chasing minor problems with it but it should have been checked fit for customer prior to me collecting it.🙁
Sam needs to step his YouTube channel up to be able to afford more cars
You need to do some more videos with Sam you've got great chemistry together and your old videos were awesome. I really believe he deserves a million subs he has such a eye for photos and filming cars plus his personality.
Taking wheels off carefully, and using a torque wrench to put them back on... I wish more garages did this
Hard to believe a dealer would miss this in vehicle  prep. Should be on check list.
Such a basic mistake really by the Merc dealer, this should have been spotted immediately during the vehicles PDI.
The title is very misleading as you dedicate most of this upload to a guy from another channel. Stop mugging us off Tim.
It may well have been an easy fix,  but I,m not sure I,d want to buy a car from them
Tim  I would get this back to your dealer and kick up a riot.  They should be reminded of their duty of care and the fact they sold you a car with this defect which coud have caused an accident.  Not impressive !!!!!!
I had my car delivered with uncalibrated headlight and highbeams, got flashed by on coming traffic constantly. Very annoying, and you pay for delivery as well...and the checklist was indeed checked off..
That shop looks like it’s in the dodgy end of London.
The SQE is out2 weeks ago. where have you been? I had to watch i on unbox therapie... focus more on cars man  not your personal ego legend :D luv ya
Sorry mate, your audio is so bad. Unacceptable audio quality for a channel this size. How can you not realize it?
Why not take it back to the main dealer?
Was this car PPF’d? Surely would have noticed then?
Shmee needs to stop "inadvertently" scraping the side of his cars so he could make videos about them.  Shmee, you don't need to ding up your car to make videos about them! We'd be PEFECTLY happy for videos involving these awesome cars! xD
Good to have Sam on here! Good lad
Love the yellow stitching on the steering wheel. Have the same thing on my 997.
Are you going to also take the gtr roadster to renntech and maybe do some tuning?
what a small problem to have indeed xD
What cowboy of a company (ies) can't remember something as fundamental to the job as removing those blocks, I bet you paid a fortune too
Honestly Tim, you are a dream customer.....this could have killed you in a high compression scenario. Its a disgrace. When I was running Dealerships, this was a sackable offence! The supplying dealer should hang their head in shame, and do some serious sucking-up.
Thank goodness.  When you said deja vu and pointed at the Merc I thought someone drove into it as well.
Surely your Mercedes Benz dealer should have picked this up when doing the PDI.?
You need to start a transport block collection.  An excellent addition to your man cave.  lol
Friday afternoon car that one lol
Instant PDI fail & the PDIrs need instantly disciplining as it's a safety issue
Well I don’t know if you paid the garage for your work but are you gonna ask the dealer for compensation?
The advert placement is actually the worst
Nothing like bashing the wheel off the caliper. Why does a shop not have a tool for that? Insane....
How is the artist calles stg mentions?
Do they not just break off?
Glad to see you filming with STG again. When will we see the whole old London car spotting crew together again? Ferrari trip..?
How long before we see the Shmuseum ?
Puppi: "I'm bored already"   Sam's Puppy: "wut?!!" //0.o\\  🤣🤣🤣
You should do a Livestream Tim where you build a Lego car and talk about cars, motorsports, your travels. Take questions from the audience. Get a special guest or 2.
Shmee, Seen Through Glass, and Twiggy all in one video, could it get anymore perfect?
Beautiful car and great to see the GTR back on the channel Shmee, looking forward to the Black Series content too 🔥
Why you not take it back to dealership??
I would expect that with Ford,  certainly not with Mercedes.
Lemme guess....DIRTDOBBERS!! ...or Someone's givin' another Shmee car, a deep rub. 🤣🤣🤣  The transport blocks?............damn!! 🤣🤣🤣
I'm surprised you wouldn't take it back to the dealership so they can fix their mistake. Makes you wonder what else they missed on their "PDI"
I work at an audi dealer in the UK, if someone left the blocks in a customers car they would definitely get a disciplinary! Especially if it was for a customer such as yourself, im interested to know if the dealer you bought this from had anything to say about this
Makes one wonder how many cars are on the roads with these suspension blocks in place.
I was assuming you got a hole in the radiator again. Glad it's a easy fix lol
Shmee will you do a POV video anytime ?
First time I hear about  suspension transport  blocks. I'm driving for over 30 years now. Your dealer should've tell you about it.
As Shmee would say, "This is not ideal."
the og’s reunited stg and shmee😁
Good afternoon Tim!
So much for Mercedes PDI deportment. I must say Tim I really enjoyed your appearance on the seen though glass episode.
Before watching: You either got rear ended (as the gtr pro), or got a stone into one of the side radiators. Update: I haven’t thought about the fact that it could even happen.🤯🤯
Great video Tim. Quick question. I know it’s completely different from what you normally do being an automotive YouTuber but have you ever considered doing a house tour video or apartment tour video?
Shmee150 Where is Your Mercedes Benz AMG G63 in Blue with a number plate SH18 MEE
Hi tim great video. Any clue when shmuseum will be done?
I forget Tim had this car wow it's been so long since I've seen it
Egg Merc Face on................................
The sad part is they had that car forever in order to remove them. Oh well, at least you knew what to do. Hopefully they compensate you in some way. Like paying for the service. Maybe throwing in a free 1at gen GLA when you pick up the Black series...
yay, more vids with the amg gtr roadster
This is shocking from Mercedes. Shouldn’t ever get missed but even worse on a car like this. They are bright yellow for a reason.
What happend to the M8
I see a Shmee video i click
Pre Delivery Inspections clearly have not been carried out properly and the dealerships should be embarrassed - the individual mechanics will know it was them because they will be watching this video….
Any idea what the black dot is on your wheel ? It’s close to where AMG is on the wheel
Very bad and dangerous mistake by Mercedes. Thank god nobody got killed.
Wow why am I only early to shmee videos and late to other channels.
The thumbnail is like : omg i cant believe it my car has another problem (and he looks so proud) no hate though😂
This is like the mercedes dealer watched your gt500 on this topic video and said oops i also did the same mistake lol
Weird thing about this is that issues actually give you more content. Love your videos Tim!
I can't imagine Tim driving in real anger. Blasting 'Move B!+ch get out the way!' and slamming his hand on the steering wheel and screaming obscenities. That would be hilarious.
Ahhh I see u upload every other day now
So much for Pre Delivery Inspection by the dealership lol
Great Videos to watch.
The only man who can talk about a problem with a smile on his face and as bubbly and enthusiastic as ever! Tim is as genuine and real as they come
I bet this is the first check for new cars from now on 😂😂😂
24th ... the amg's problem is not that severe ,  no worries it will be ok
When are you picking up your Black Series ?
Hi Shmee I’m a new subscriber to your channel! My dream is a all electric Corvette someday they will make them.
Shmee orders a car  Factory leaves transport blocks in the suspension Shmee makes a video Shmee orders a car  The cycle continues
Really like the red on the GTR Roadster glistening in the sun!
What in the world is deja bu may I ask
When will we see the next update on theshmuseum? love the vids so envious when you were in the US and we were here stuck in lockdown in the UK 👍👍
Hi
Shmee, your STO Spec was amazing! I legit would have chosen the exact same spec! Loving the videos!
How are you feeling Tim? We were concerned about your health a few days ago. 😬👍😀💜
Greetings
So this video was on the day of the behind the glass podcast, right ? Or after ? I’m confused
#Shquad......hi Tim, I'm sure you will be checking all your new cars from now on.......what is PDI for anyway🧐
Oh no another problem? Car issues am I right 😒
Sorry that happened Tim, but that color is phenomenal, like a solid volcano red
AMG PWR!!!!!!

Hi Shmee I'm guys. Do you think you will do a South African after covid agian?
How the hell does this get missed?! The QC in handover for several of these companies is really not very good!
hello
Hey Tim, do not make Shtress. Everthing is fine                 (I guess lmao, isn't it??)
❤️❤️❤️
hi
First
How crazy is it that this happened twice in the last couple of months?!
