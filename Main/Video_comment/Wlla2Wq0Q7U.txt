THIS is what would have happened if the Levees had been built strong enough to resist Katrina's surge.
Hmm it might look interesting.
mrbeast is here to help
Jesus is the only way into Heaven Ask Him into your life, cleanse you from ALL unrighteousness Confess with your mouth that Jesus is your Lord & your Savior One day U will enter the Kingdom of Heaven

Is it worse than Katrina?
Biden’s fault
From Jersey just went through the hurricane last night and goddamn
I see the police aren't robbing civilians of their firearms this time..   Martial law is illegal..
😮☝️🙏
🥺😩😫I'm so sad for them what a disaster 😭
What can people do in this situation? First, they should know the real information about what it is happening. All information is in the conference "Global crisis. This already affects everyone", organized by volunteers from 180 countries. Second, people should unite, all together, to become one family, one Humanity, one Creative Society and survive in the period of coming global disasters because our planet entered the top of 12000 year climate change cyclicity.
All anambra  .0rj
At least they still had power?
it’s time for louisiana and run all of their wiring underground
Prayers from Tx🙏🏿🇺🇲❤️
How come you won't allow comments on Biden's speech? Cowards.
SO GLAD GOD IS TEARING THIS PLACE UP.
OMG
😲
Sending prayers to you all, 😢👑
As much as I hate to see people lose their life and damage to occur I think it’s time for New Orleans to either build their houses stronger or level the whole city because it seems that all the hurricanes hit there so they know what to expect when they live there either battle it out or leave. You’re not going to change anything.
Finally have power restored in Slidell. We could be so much worse off, but lots of roof damage. New Orleans, LaPlace, Grand Isle and Port Fouchon are all much worse off and sending prayers to them.
I feel sorry for people who have Fred loya insurance. Literally parks car in their driveway. Fred Loya insurance: “well we denied your claim, because you shouldn’t have parked in your driveway. If you would parked in the street it wouldn’t have happen.”
Lord be with these people.🙏
YYEEEAAAAAAHHHHHH
I live in Florida hurricanes suck, my heart goes out to y'all this is so heartbreaking what's even worse there below sea level
Did you notice how often abnormal climatic events happen now? This is gonna strengthen. And the culmination will be catastrophic. You can hear all the shocking details of what really happens globally from scientists who are brave enough to say the truth to the public in the international conference "Global Crisis. This already affects everyone". No one can overcome what awaits us on their own, only united in respect and peace we can accumulate whole our potential to create a plan for how we all can survive. It is time to become humanity as one family and start taking care of each other. United we can change the system and make this world safe and friendly for everyone
I’m supposed to go to New Orleans next month for my 30th guess that’s not happening
This Ida destroyed more then hurricanes before with evacuation
Weak i been threw worse with midwest twisters
Imagine going through this in the mist of a pandemic 😔 Have mercy..,Prayers out to everyone in Louisiana
Doesn't look that bad. What's all the fuse about? Lol.  Actually just hoping everyone is safe that look terrible.
Ida thought it be worse
See 13 American soldiers look during potato disaster evacuation
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
LOUSIANA RESIDENTS - PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU PREPARE AND DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO BE SAFE AND TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILY BECAUSE IF OUR MORON PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN HAS TO MAKE A DECISION DURING THIS HURRICANE, THERE WILL BE TONS OF CASUALTIES JUST LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IN AFGHANISTAN.  DON'T DEPEND ON OUR GOVERNMENT AND MUCH LESS IN OUR MORON PRESIDENT TO TAKE CARE OF THINGS.  DO THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW WILL WORK AND WILL PROTECT YOU DURING THIS VERY DIFFICULT PERIOD.  WE ALL HOPE YOU CAN GET BACK TO NORMAL AFTER THIS HORRIBLE HARD HURRICANE. GOD BLESS...
Nicklaus Mickelson
Jesus is coming. Are you ready? Repent of your sins and believe in Him!!
It's just a rainstorm to them. Otherwise why would anyone still be living in that region?
we call this Tuesday in Florida.
Louisiana Strong 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
The government and federal reserve will send tons of money for relief efforts and rebuild the entire city. We all will be contributing this effort through central bank planned hyperinflation and prices of everything going up from now on like gas, food prices, housing prices, rent etc…
Support Legislation in the U.S. to END COURT ORDERED RAPE!
I was worried about flooding, but it seems the local gov't learned their lesson with Katrina.
Hope y'all have plenty of booze!
New Orleans is sinking and I don't give af
*The Lord’s coming* Birthing pains before his return, End Days
So who cares, this is every year, big deal, move
😯 wow 😮
WHO GIVES A SH*T?! WEATHER HAPPENS. ABANDON THE SWAMP CALLED NEW ORLEANS
Who ever doing tha recording is stupid
Scary stuff.
Me who was there during Katrina: Yeah that looks about right.
This poor state always ends up in a mess I feel for them
One would expect cell phone coverage will cease to exist soon . Hello , hello hello
🌎🔜🔥B.C. and A.D. are timemarks everyone uses. Jesus Christ is the one and only Lord and Savior who Rose again. There is no peace without repentance and resurrection. ⏳⚰️🪦✝️
Good. What a degenerate city
In other news: Jeff Bezos is going to Sue Hurricane Ida for being so wet!!!
Visited this beautiful city a few months back and fell in love with the rich culture and the welcoming people, I really hope you all are safe!
I hope this finally washes away the piss smell from all of the alleyways.
Sending healing energy and love to my hometown... <3 <3
This is very brutal.
I feel sorry for Louisiana residents that have to depend on biden for help.
They didn't learn nothing after Katrina in 2005. They choose to stay in Louisiana rather than move western. So enjoy that hurricane and the next one...
GOD KEEP YOU ALL STRONG.
New Orleans before z hurricane: ugly & filthy.🤢 New Orleans after z hurricane: ugly & filthy.🤢
Hope everyone is safe I am praying for you all 🙏
never seen a hurricane up close before, very cool.
i dont live in new orleans by the way also i was there pobably 4 weeks ago i wnt there on vaction
how is praying to people wrong really that  your momo loves me
Keep your hat on folks God bless you all.
very minor damage if they are showing a few trees and rolling trash cans
I am from Bangladesh, very dangerous hurricane.
They learned nothing from Hurricane Betsy, nothing from Camille, nothing from Katrina, nothing from ANY hurricane going back to 1812! THAT one destroyed the entire area and the French consul wrote that not even the oldest person in their settlement had seen anything like it.  It's moronic!  Only since the industrial revolution has this idea of never letting a city die taken hold. The best thing you could do for New Orleans is to let the hurricane have it's fun. Then bulldoze the whole place and turn it into a nice wildlife sanctuary.
Keep in mind that for four years that orange POS and the entire GQP refused to do anything but help themselves...remember they only like white people...
why don't they bury the electrical lines like they do in Colorado?
God bless the people of New Orleans!
Climate change is real
BIDEN BEST President in HISTORY
Why don't they show south Louisiana and the flooding in LaPlace?
Hurricane ida hit my area after 18 year of hurricane katrina kenta nunnery is still a survivor 1:28
Some folks Pray like the Devil others Pray like Yeshua, I don't care just as long as U Pray. Learning is not always easy but don't give up..
Aww..man..remembering Katrina. I just hope everyone is okay.
The Washington Post story on Sunday, August 29 on Eritrea is fake and unsubstantiated. This is a war that is instigated by the corrupt and criminal TPLF against the Ethiopian and Eritrean people. The story reads that 15 Eritrean soldiers repeatedly raped a Tigray woman; where is the evidence? The TPLF media machine concocted fake stories like the one in the Washington Post to deceive the international media of the truth. Eritreans are honorable people; never in their 40 years of struggle committed any type of atrocities. On the other hand, TPLF has continued to rape the women in the Amhar and Afar region; loot and burn properties - things they had done for the past 30 years. We say, "Shame Washington Post" for being the voice of a terrorist organization. Where is your credbility!
Can't  wait to see people coming  up with climatechange hashtags  trending in twitter 🐦😊
Brought to you by George Bush.
We should sent old biden there To see if can walk straight
New Orleans never should have been reoccupied as a residential area after Katrina.
The ad sign was torn off.. now I don’t know what to buy 😭
Well all of my electrical linesman are allready driving down south!
Man, you guys should shut your channel down. Most pathetic news channel out there
Reading the comments I can't help but think if this was California they would be filled with hate. Take care New Orleans we are all pulling for you. You have certainly been through some tough times. All love.
You should be in doors! Don't take silly risks just for a video! It's going to get worse much worse next year even worse...Then a deep freeze will hit!
Pay back time.
I love Mother Nature.
It wouldnt have happened if the americans wore their masks!
Is Cafe Du Monde open? Itching for a coffee and a sugared donut...but seriously, prayers for the legendary city...and the state of LA
Remember the last time the Gulf was going to be devastated by a hurricane and it turned out to be a bad rainstorm? Yeah, keep watching.
Why aren't more power lines underground in the US and why aren't more buildings made with brick, as opposed to wood?
They need the Saints to come marching in prayers
You cant fight God at least open the Churches
They actually did a good job. Looks way better than expected.
😢🙏🙏🏻🙏🏼🙏🏽🙏🏿
The cataclysms that are now taking place in the world are cyclical. And strength, power, constancy will only increase. Many people think that the cases are lonely and temporary, but they are not. More detailed information can be obtained by watching the conference: Global Crisis. This already affects everyone.
*All nations before Him are as nothing; and they are counted to Him less than nothing, and vanity. That bringeth the princes to nothing; He maketh the judges of the earth as vanity. To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto Him? ~ Isaiah 40:17-18,23.*
This is what happens when you upset the almighty god he looking baby at everything
Praying for New Orleans 🙏.
Why didn't Biden downgrade the Hurricane... At least Trump would had turned it into a "Dick".
Why didn't Biden downgrade the Hurricane... At least Trump would had turned it into a "Dick".
I'm sorry but there is no way I could or even care to visit New Orleans. It's so swampy is dangerous around this time of year. I don't understand why it's so important to stay somewhere so dangerous below sea level
Is that D4, from the crew, running through the streets at 0:42?
Confused..  WP usually only reports on how forced vax and Biden's foreign policy is good for americs....
"And when affliction touches man, he calls upon Us, whether lying on his side or sitting or standing; but when We remove from him his affliction, he continues [in disobedience] as if he had never called upon Us to [remove] an affliction that touched him. Thus is made pleasing to the transgressors that which they have been doing"
I think they should start building a house made of stone.
This a REMINDER FROM NATURE
Looks pretty minor for almost a cat 5
I could believe when I saw the Electrical infrastracture  of these part of USA!    Is this really part of USA or third world? It's joke? these  people (Government) are going around the world Impose their will by force / wars to others  while they can't take care of the citizen. Someone has tell USA politicians to visit china and see and learn how city electrical infustructure looks like.
America is failing to cope the disasters.
Why is god doing this to us, we didn't do anything wrong. Wtf man.
I thought Joe Biden said when he became president there wouldn’t be hurricanes and bad weather anymore
see, if they would have called it hurricane Daisy as i told them, it would have petered out into a mild rain storm
I lived in midcity for a year. New Orleans is probably the most foul city in the country. I feel no sympathy ... Auwful people
“I will heap on them one disaster after another,   I will use up all my arrows on them:   pangs of hunger, ravages of plague,    and bitter pestilence.” – (Deuteronomy 32: 23-24) –  “Turn back all of you to God’s help; practice loyalty and justice   and wait always upon your God.” – (The Prophet Hosea 12: 6) –
Visited this beautiful city a few months back and fell in love with the rich culture and the welcoming people, I really hope you all are safe!
How about Pennsylvania Avenue?????
Accrochez-vous là-bas en Louisiane... vous avez traversé des pires, vous passerez à travers celui-ci aussi mes amis. Sincèrement de vos amis de l’autre côté de la frontière au Texas. Que les bons moments roulent, bébé!

nature shows NO MERCY 😱
terrifying
one thing that blows my mind is how merciful our climate actually is , considering we have to rotate 360 degrees at around 27,000 miles diameter in 24 hours which is more than a 1,000 miles per hour . how small are we ? more fun facts right ?
My brother was suppose to visit there tomorrow. Glad it hit now than tomorrow cuz then he would have been n trouble
Trump 2024
Stay strong !
“For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭6:23‬ ‭NKJV‬‬ When I gave my life to Jesus, I got saved, was no longer a slave to sin, I had peace, joy and happiness in my life and I continue to do so. Growing up I was not raised in the church and I did not want to go even if I went when I was really little, but I did not really learn anything so I was not a believer. When I began college I gave my life to Jesus and my life began to change for the better. A big part of this came from understanding more that the evil in this world stems from devil(satan), and he uses many people in the world to do bad things. God loves us to have faith in Him and surrender our life to Him. He also wants people to repent from their sins so they can all live their life for Him. My life went from not knowing God and not wanting to go to church to living for Him and being fulfilled and content in my life.
Meh, I've seen worse.
Why do they keep,rebuilding power lines above ground on poles?
It breaks my heart to see such a beautiful city get destroyed by ida so many memories I had there never gonna forget you nola I'll always be praying for you nola
It may be time for the people that live in the greater New Orleans area to think about leaving that area. Permanently. Because this will keep happening, and one day, that whole area will be under water.
WOW!
Does anyone think about the stray animals probably scared outta their minds??? 😢😢😢
Yup...still a liberal shithole!!!
Be safe
Maybe this storm will clean up the China virus and blow it away
😱🙏
Hm. Maybe that Six Flags property should just be demolished.
BOO!  You mean AFTER the hurricane came.  Dummies
Some rainx on your windows would clear up your video so you don't use your wipers so much.  Just sayin
The boondocks about to make another episode of this
End of Times........
IT CAME IN MY TOWN
These storms cause too much damaged and destruction lost lives I can't see myself living there
Probably should  move out of mother nature's way....IDK just saying!!!!   Let's settle here and no matter what keep settling!!!   You know what this is a sign.   I'm not settling anymore!!!   I'm moving to New Orleans!!!!
Greetings
Prayers for New Orleans🙏🙏🙏
I'll keep my snow. Prayers to those affected by this storm.
Praying for everybody in Ida's path😔
u think they're using the harrp?
I pray that the levees hold up this time.🙏❤️
Im just praying to God it isn't another Katrina
Atleast its not flooded like Katrina thank God.
OMG 😱🙏🙏🙏
Looks like the wind is more of an issue than the water. Wow.
Is there thunder a lightening within a hurricane?
Don’t worry! The Blue States will pay for it all!
Be stay all 🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️🇦🇺🇦🇺
Thankfully the black work force and their monetary contribution will fix the city ASAP
Praying for you, New Orleans.
My thoughts and prayers for New Orleans
Like praying is ever going to help...
2 years ago my job required me to transfer to New Orleans.  I quit the next day. F that.
Democrats the criminal party subverting everything
Democracy dies with fake news democrat run criminal media
Humans should get used to it as a everyday event in 100 years. What if we wake up and this happenning in a random place on earth every day.
I wonder when the power companies will start putting their lines underground.
Bets are this storm will be just like Katrina over a decade ago probably worse since these Hurricanes cause mass destruction.
Hope people are safe
Can't believe there are rains at this very time in other parts of the world, Here in my country it's just clear sun day after day, I can only see our house and the second home from ours is 15 kms away, the Kalahari sun can be cruel at sometimes,
wow, I haven't seen a garbage can in Australia since the 80s.
Its odd some people are allowed to run around wherever in their cars
Let's pray the Biden doesn't leave any one stranded....in Louisiana or Afghanistan
Good, that place needed a bath,
I recognize that WXChasing footage at 1:22
Hello higher gas prices.
Jesus is coming soon REPENT and accept Jesus TODAY
Louisiana: Has hurricanes Also Louisiana:  Thinks billboards are a good idea still
The whole city has no power.
If only they treated a pandemic by doing this, being inside. The numbers would be down.
Oh WOW! Hhu woulda THUNK!!
Prayer and Stay Strong Louisiana! Godbless  🙏 🙏
This is lame I want to see carnage and destruction
Praying for New Orleans I had an amazing vacation there that unfortunately ended do to those weather conditions the love that those people give out is remarkable they do not deserve such a storm #🙏🏾All Ok
God trying to tell us something
God trying to tell us something

Nature is so beautiful. The earth showing who is boss.   People seem to say we’ll destroy the planet, but forget how strong it is. We will be wiped out long before earth is.
PAY BACK TIME!!!! HIROSHIMA NUKE BOMB, NAGASAKI NUKE BOMB, OVER CIVILIANS, US TOOK 58% OF MEXICAN TERRITORY BY FORCE, PAY BACK TIME.  NO MERCY!!!!
The power of nature !
Place needed a bath, anyway... Thoughts and prayers.
' why why dept of parks / trees or dept of city halls are not orders to cutting all the trees trims before the storm come
New Orleans looks like a end of the road society:  what a dump.   🌬🕯
So after Katrina,  why are ANY of them still there...  ???
The governor said they have a system in place that is supposed to lesson the impact of the storm so maybe that’s why it doesn’t look so bad!
Is it me or how many people think this was done? I mean the exact date that hurricane Katrina hit  16 years ago🤔
Why keep living there
Wow what building was that down?
They control the weather too .
Breaking news AUMN found a huge gold vein 150 meters long catalyst
Why y’all keep installing stuff that’s not hurricane proof, I know we’ve been through this before..
Stayed up all night praying for the region as this storm was a monster, just crossing over into cat 5 status, yet the damage wasn’t anywhere near as bad as it could’ve been.  I truly believe God was answering all of our prayers.  Thank Him, amen.
Compared to Katrina this is ok right now
Praying for those affected🖤 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Looks like the infrastructure improvements helped a ton. This actually looks reasonable unlike last time
all of you people get in your cars and head north
🙏🏼God help
very hard to watch.
Maybe it's time for the US to think about putting the electric wiring in the ground as most of the other industrialized countries of the world?
Holy bird schlitz
Mother Nature is the boss.
I don’t care what advice ya give me, I ain’t going to shelter #1 1:45
Hope it doesnt flood, last time with Katrina they flushed all the turds into Texas.
I hope there are no deaths caused by the storm. The damage seems to not be that bad so far.
The drab hen advisably follow because nose ecologically practise times a red box. good, waiting snowstorm
Love you Nola ❤
As and after are two different words......

Why don't they make the levies over 8 ft  hi like a castle wall. When I was there it was about 4ft tall
Ewe theu are eben the water well I know they on eberything water food all that but ewe. Worm rain
Levees and offshore oil rigs have me worried.
Knocked down a few of their alien things
I'm rooting for you New Orleans. Don't go down. Been there and lov ya
Imagine living in place where you constantly have to rebuild your community. Dummies
That's Hot
New Orleans and Haiti have to be the most cursed placed natural disaster wise. They never get a break.
Don't accept Government help. Government is bad. Do it yourself. Don't kneel to the tyranny of government. The South will rise again....wearing a life jacket.
bring Jesus to America....from NZ
Pray there is no flooding like last time... I hope the work paid off
zuzu + hhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhh
That’s not bad
If this was the 1600s without the technoly we have now i wouldve thought this is judgement day or sum😂
This really blows..stay safe!
I m very  much  sorry
Makes me so sad to see this. year after year.. we have to make a change in the world because we have really messed up! I will pray for you and please stay safe out there!
His to many one somesing
Look at California no rain for almost a year and a half wouldn't it be nice to get a  rainy days here
😱😱😱😱 I PRAY that everyone is okay😥
Dios bemdiga a American
Take it easy .... ❤️ The big easy
Praise God the levees havent broken!
I know I sound heartless but come on. This happens every year and every year everyone seems to be surprised. And every year millions of government funds into repairing and rebuilding. So no I don't feel that badly. Figure something out to better protect from these yearly hurricanes or move.
Now if it would just hit New York and California.
“For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.” ‭‭Revelation‬ ‭22:15‬ ‭
Thank God that was not Galveston again.
gad bless that camera man🇺🇸
WHY DO YOU YOKELS IN THE USA STILL HAVE YOUR POWER LINES ABOVE GROUND ?? 😂😂😂😂😂😂 GET INTO THE 21ST CENTURY FOR CHRIST SAKES !!!! 🤪🤪😆😆😆😆
And we got raging fires here in calif.
For a 4 it ain't that bad, Mexico beach was wiped off the map.
Hurricane Ida, please come to California. We desperately need you, but just send a little bit of you here.
Looks like the redone levee system handled its business- NICE
Storm after storm after storm. I could never live there. I don't see how people do it.
JESUS SAVES..EVEN MARDI GRAS ATTENDEES WHO REPENT
IT hasn't torn through yet. This is false news.

Not after the truth, just at the service of the empire!
Just Dangerous
i was  on that block were the damge is
Totally engineered and they lied about how strong it was.
I gave the guy with " the End is Near!" Sign a dollar. WTF!
Strong reminder of how George W. Bush did nothing for many days, some of the worst behavior of a president imaginable.
bruh i was recnently in new orleans 3 4 weeks ago
Mardi gras, wicked festival And wonder why God is doing this. Yes I said God Not "Mother Nature" Which contrary to opinion, isn't found in Scripture
Prayers go out to you and your loved ones. Please stay safe.
Those waves were perfect for surfing down lakeshore drive.🏄🏼
Jesus Christ saves from sin. Romans 3: 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Hebrews 9: 27  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: Isaiah 64: 6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. Revelation 21: 8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. Romans 5: 8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. John 3: 16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 14: 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. Romans 10: 9-10.  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Jesus said John 5: 24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. 1John 5: 10-13 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. Ephesians 2: 8-9  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Romans 8: 1  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 1 Corinthians 15: 3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 2 Corinthians 5: 21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. ,............................................................................................
Doesn’t look too bad so far. Hope the coast further south is in as good of shape.
Louisiana is evacuating that’s what I heard
Praying from Trinidad.
While this is sad it's nothing compared to covid-19. What kills me is all my family/friends who are still in denial over covid who still won't get the vaccine and still don't care about anyone dying as a result of covid because they see it as some political non-sense look at a hurricane like this and like omg you see how bad that hurricane is and such? What, significantly more people will die today from covid in just 1 day in the US then this hurricane will, Even Hurricane Katrina one of most deadliest hurricanes in our countries history due to the flooding in New Olreans mainly still didn't even reach 2,000 deaths, a number we have seen on single days from Covid-19. I'm not trying to discount the hurricane, I'm trying to make these covid deniers wake up and start taking action and start getting the vaccine, ,fi they care so much about a few dozen people dying in a hurricane then they should be caring about the hundreds of day dying right now from covid, every single day. Unlike the hurricane, covid is easily preventable.
That's not bad
Rip New Orleans, once again lol
If it is not one thing, its another.  Hold on.  💙💙💙
SOS For Louisana
Stay save
Thank God this is a fast moving storm because Louisiana can't handle the flooding.
Hope all the animals and people are ok.
no amount of water can wash away the filth that is new orleans  >:(

Prayers from South Florida for everyone's safety!!!
I'd still take it over California any day
Why are those power lines not underground?
Insurance companies now.
PRAYING FOR EVERYONE GOD PLEASE SAFE THE PEOPLE WHO STAYED
God has another disaster to explain to the faithful! Send money to the Red Cross, they get things done. I hope everyone got out of the way of that thing.
Looks like tiny damage…good.
They're all fucked sadly.
Oh dear. How is the flooding?
Beautiful weather.
It's not over yet 🙏🙏🙏🙏
😅🤣🤣🤣🤣😆😆
Nature's way of cleaning up Babylon
As a Floridian we feel for them. Damage looks very minor, thought it would be much worse. In Andrew absolutely nothing was left standing in our area. The nation needs to be ready to help them recover.
Hope the leve holds.
Looks mild, CAT 5 Andrew in Florida you couldn’t see anything, it was walls of whiteness. In Andrew , most trees were down
Okay, looks like a rain storm with some trees down.  They still have power.
PRAYING 🙏 FOR EVERYONE'S SAFETY 🙏✝️💓🙌IN JESUS MIGHTY NAME AMEN 🙌 ❤️ 🙏 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
It hasn't landed yet
*Hope everyone stays safe.*  Sending thoughts and good vibes to LA from HOU. We know what this is like. Look out for one another.  ❤️🙏🏼
Wow, so sad😭😭😭 😞
Mother Nature is pissed off! Do I blame her? No I don’t.
Remind me again there is no such thing as climate change.
Tell me again how climate change isn’t real
Praying that everyone stays safe and secure!!! 🙏
