"Button up that tunic! Theres a good lad."  - "But Sarge, my nips are starting to chafe!".  "My nipples are chafing too lad.... but this is the uniform Queen Victoria honours us with.....and this is the uniform we shall wear!!   Absolute classic line! Such a shame that many new versions now omit it and those who saw the orignal have often forgotten it.
It is very interesting seeing their careers after the event. Fascinating for Bourne to see the development of warfare with tanks and aircraft. It must have been wonderous for those Victorian gentlemen to see such times. Truly a remarkable man.
11 VICTORIA CROSSES WERE GIVEN OUT BECAUSE BRITAIN NEEDED A VICTORY,, THEY HAD JUST GOT THEIR ASSES KICKED AND SO NEEDED SOMETHING TO GIVE MORAL BACK TO THE CIVIES,, IT WAS PURE PROPAGANDA,, ALTHOUGH I FEEL EVERY MAN DESERVED A MEDAL AND REGOGNITION FOR HIS BRAVORY IN THAT BATTLE,, I FEEL THE BLOODY BRITISH EMPIRE MILKED IT FOR WAT THEY COULD
Thanks
QUESTION:  Do you think the producers of the film "ZULU"  portrayed Color Sergeant Borne as a bit more mature man (certainly older than his actual 24 years)  because they did not think audiences would believe that such a YOUNG man could be so wise and self-disciplined?
I love that film!  I LOVE the history of the British Army !  It and other films and books have made me something of an Anglophile
“Nobody told you to stop working.”  😊
Color Seargent Frank Bourne was the consummate example of what a senior Non-Commioned Officer should be. He replied to the Commanding Officer of the Rourke's Drift, " with some guts behind the British Soldiers who defended Rourkes Drift".
Thank you for the story (as ex-Army). Such a hero.
A 5 ft 3 inch GIANT . . .
What would we do without you reminding us of old ghosts all should admire. No one ever dies unless they are completely forgotten. You help ghosts to live. Thank you . . .
After Bourne quoted the psalm and the soldiers just stood there looking at him. "Alright nobody told you to stop working, you lead back sided...get sweating!"
Reverend Otto Witt: [shouting, drunkenly] He breaketh the bow and snappeth the spear in sunder! Color Sgt. Bourne: [under his breath] I shall be exalted among the 'eathens... I shall be exalted in the Earth. Psalm 46.
Used to show Zulu as the standard "leadership" film in the Army of Oz.  Could pick the mistakes and say much of the dialogue. The DCM was highly prized because it did contain the ten pound annual gratuity - see the writing of Frank Richards (real name Francis Philip Woodruff DCM, MM (7 April 1883 – 26 August 1961)) in his Old Soldiers Never Die.  He almost resented the MM because it did not include the pension !  Richards (Woodruff) must have been unique - he served the entire war as a private in the line on the Western Font.
Why was he nor awarded the George Cross.
Well said!  Thank you
Brilliant.
The actor that played him certainly deserved an award!  Steady lads!!!
I've watched this episode now probably about 10 times and have just noticed that I hadn't before this given it the 👍 My apologies Chris, that's what happens when you're binge watching as you said 😊great story
The fact that he didn't receive the V.C confuses me. He absolutely displayed conspicuous devotion to service. I have always felt that he was the glue that bound the enlisted men together, enabling them to hold together and repel attack after attack. There should be a campaign to rectify that, but with so much time having passed it is a forelorne hope.
glad to see the bbc was shit then to
The rank insignia for a Colour Sergeant at the time or the Zulu Wars was three chevrons with crossed Union Flags above, but in the film C/Sgt Bourne did not have the latter. Was it correct or did the producers get the detail wrong?
SALUTE!
"Hitch, do yer tunic up.  Do it up!!!  Who do you think you are, man?!"
I seen Zulu Dawn first in the 80s. Loved it. Then in the early 90s I bought a VHS of Zulu, which I still have. It was even better.
Colour Sergeant Bourne died at the age of 91 at his home address, 16 kings Hall Road, Beckenham, Kent on May 9th 1945, the day after the second world war ended. His blue disc can be seen on google earth street view above the front door
"Officer on parade."
“Alright then.  Nobody told you to stop working”
Hey thanks for the info... CSM Bourne is a Legend, just like all the squadies at Rourkes Drift... British Soldiers all the way... "Stand To....!!" ❤
I dont really care much about historical accuracy in movies since they usually prioritize artistic value (or financial greed nowadays) over anything else. If anyone gets their History from Movies, thats their fault to begin with I would say.  Having said that, the depiction of Colour Sergeant Bourne in the Movie is truly remarkable and a great example of what an NCO should be. He is stern, disciplined and has a good eye for things that might cause trouble. One of the often overlooked parts where he plays a crucial role is when the Cavalry abandons them and the men are mortified and look in horror as they ride away. It is Colour Sergeant Bourne that breaks the tension with what seems to be extremely mundane given the circumstances when he says "get back to work" but his timing is impeccable and possibly averts despair taking a hold of the men by sending them back to duties and away from thinking too much about it.  Another scene is when the Soldier, visibly shaken, that guards the Priest is being subjected to the sermons of the Priest raising doubts in him. The Colour Sergeant gives him a stern look bringing him back in line and then (incredible performance by the actor) tells the Priest to basically "STFU" in a way that seems elegant and well spoken but at the same time carries over a silent but definitive menace/threat which is generally a part of the depiction of the Character throughout the Movie.  When he says "Now there is a good Gentlemen", you understand that what he is really saying is "do or Im gonna rip you a new one" and you believe he will.
No one told you to stop working
"All right, nobody told you to stop working."
"Steady Lad"......favorite quote! Wore out three DVD's of this movie!!!!!
"There's a good gentleman..."
The BBC doing something daft? Never... Anyway - Remarkable man, thanks for the video.
I wes in a museum in St Stephens Barracks Kilkenny , Ireland and the regimental colours from that regiment , after Rocks drift and the Zulu war the Regiment was sent to Kilkenny and that's how the museum  have them and other artifacts today , look it up
The best descriptions of this battle are found in, _Blackadder Goes Forth_, the memoirs of Captain Edmund Blackadder. There exists also a homonymous 1980s television documentary.
"Without Courage, We are Nothing" is a old Russian Proverb.
Definitely worth a listen.
Comment for the algorithm. Great video Chris!
I was born the year this film was released. I like that connection, tentative as it is... They know my voice when they hear it sir". Or "Go on get...sweating".
My favourite:" alright men! Nobody told you to stop working!:
Typical of the BBC to bin history
Rule of seniority worked wonder in Rockes Drift. It unintentionally placed an engineer to take command in that defensive battle - an ideal choice. Communist Chinese soldiers in the Cultural Revolution on the other hand would disintegrate in that situation.
Brilliant lol - my favourite is roll call at end of “HIcks”… he doesn’t answer and Borne says “Hicks your alive I saw you”. Hicks reponds saying Sergent ….. and Bourne replies “Sir… Officer on parade…. “ then sends him to infirmary.  LOL
The English should not have been in South Africa.
I wrote a paper on the Battle of Biak that occurred during WWII. It was an incredible story and I think few know of it. It was just a grueling tropical summer on a coral cliff shored island that was home to three Japanese Airfields. Fighting in the South Pacific was like traveling to the moon to fight. There was little in the way of supply or maintenance. I know that General McArthur's army contained Australian sailors and airmen. So any involvement of those sailors and airmen in that battle, that would make a good video. A eldest son of the of President Theodore Roosevelt, Lieutenant Colonel Theodore Roosevelt Jr., was pinned down under the coral cliffs with the 162nd Infantry Regiment which had to be repositioned by LVTs and DUKWs. Royal Australian Navy ships participated in the Allied task force, included: - HMAS Australia (heavy cruiser) - HMAS Shropshire (heavy cruiser) - HMAS Warramunga (destroyer) - Australian air squadrons also contributed to strategic air support, operating from bases as far away as Darwin.
This is an excellent video, and your narration was spot on. He was definitely a great hero thank you.
Can you please elaborate on the offer of VC vs. Commission as an officer, why he refused the commission (because it would have cost him personally to take an officer's commission?  Seems goofy) and if he refused the commission, why he did not get the VC instead?  I'm a bit confused about all of that.
Sergeant Major Plumley at LZ X-ray
Nigel Green was acting but Frank Bourne wasn't.  He did his job magnificently.   What an amazing career.
"Mr.Witt, Sir.  Be quiet now, will you.  There's a good gentleman.  You'll upset the lads..."
This was so interesting. Such a brave man.
Dear History Chap,  The work you do is inspiring and should be made compulsory viewing for British children and adults alike, as well as those wishing to settle and become part of our great country.  You truly bring back to life the courage, camaraderie and Christian morality that were the values of Britain and the British Empire. At a time when British and English pride and self esteem are at an all time low, your work is more important than we know.
Wow!! That is a GREAT story. Thank you for sharing.
Great video love it
Mine is "alright then! No one told you to stop working" just the way he says it in a deep voice and everyone is like oh dam quick move! I may have miss quoted but I'm sure it was something like that.
Mister Witt Sir, be quiet now, will you? There's a good gentleman. You'll upset the lads.
Wow! what an interesting life he lead.
Not only the backbone of the British Army - but its beating heart too. A great man.
you're alive ... I saw you
Hey hookie that's a flogging offence!
So true.
Everyone knows Colour Sergeant Frank Bourne as the unflappable hero of Rorke’s Drift, but few know he also dabbled in amateur espionage after hours—mostly to outwit the quartermaster for extra rations. One foggy evening in 1880, while sneaking out with a wheelbarrow full of pilfered tinned peaches, he bumped into a mysterious woman named Helga von Whackenschmidt, an undercover Prussian opera singer-spy with a weakness for moustaches and men who say "Fix bayonets!" in a firm tone. Nine months later, the first in a long line of astonishingly stealthy, suspiciously multilingual descendants was born. Generations passed, the peach smuggling genes diluted, but the tactical genius and brooding stare remained—until finally, one Jason Bourne awoke on a boat, memory wiped, but somehow still craving tinned peaches and shouting “Defend the hospital!” in his sleep.
thanks Chris keek up the history
exccelent thanks for your history lesson
Watching this I was inspired to try to connect Colour Sergeant Bourne into my family tree. Always knew there must be a connection due to Bourne and Balcombe. Finally found it. My Great Great Aunt's husbands 2nd cousin. A bit obscure as is another connection to the Poet Percy Bysshe Shelley who would be C/Sgt Bourne's 2nd Cousin's wife's 3rd cousin twice removed. It's a small world.
“Steady lad”
Well done. Thank you.
Sir,officer on parade.
The BBC binned his interview...There arent words. Theyll parade around degenerates and criminals but theyll bin real British history and heroes. Rotten even back then.
"A rifle Hughes"
Bourne favorite comment, “Now be a good gentleman..”
Well, now we know the Bourne Identity
Bourne family now run an agregates and soil business at Newenden. Their trucks rumble past my location on a daily basis. They are involved in local politics and many local enterprises.😉
And to think that some complete and utter moron binned an audio recording of the last surviving member of Rorkes drift. BBC a ship of absolute fools to be very polite.
Thanks
I would like you to do a video on my relative on my grandmother's side of the family, Benjamin Jesty the farmer from Yetminster who inoculated his family against smallpox twenty years or so before Edward Jenner. Thanks
The defenders at Rorkes Drift were almost out of ammunition at the time the Zulus gave up attacking. Had the Zulus known that, it could have been a different story (or no story at all!)
*Thanks for this excellent video.* x It was so good to hear and watch 🙏🏻
My old mates ancestor was at Rourkes Drift - and bloomin' survived!      Got to say, (albeit gushingly,) that Nigel Green as the Colour Sargeant in Zulu... have had an ENDLESS CRUSH on ... (he was beautiful in Reach for the Sky too.) Am glad Frank got the pension. Was more helpful day to day than a bit of tin. Sargeant was as far as he was going to get basically - until he accepted the award.  That's a REAL soldier. Nice decent solid chap. 🙋🏻‍♀️
"Do your tunic up, lad, where do you think you are!"  The most British attitude you'll ever see!
"Hitch? Hitch I saw you. You're alive"  As a veteran I love little touches of humor like that. They add so much realism. 😂
What an amazing life he lived. Really enjoyed watching as always.  Thank you.
My father was a lay pracher a great one for the psalms he was .... now now Mr with don't upset the lads.
He was much younger than depicted in the film I yhink he was in his 20s.
"Nobody told you to stop workin'" and " Now Sir..there's a good gentleman..we don't want to be worrying the men..Now do we" Bourne to drunk vicar. ...we'll if you must ask Sir , my father was a lay preacher...it'd 'Ave to be one of the Psalms..I suppose" Bourne to drunk vicar.  "Doo yer tunic up lad"
Just watched this again, the thing that shines through is the modesty of people such as Frank Bourne. He just got on with performing his duty right the way through his career. The Bourne VC debate will no doubt continue, but I think he would have thought he was just doing his job at Rourkes Drift. Whilst Nigel Green doesn’t physically resemble CSgt Bourne at the battle, I think the gravitas and stoicism his character displays is probably fitting for how he conducted himself throughout the action. Stand easy Frank Bourne, your duty is well and truly done..!! 🫡
Thank you fantastic ✌️❤️🤘
Thank you. What an interesting life, and incredible story. What a remarkable man !
Color Sergeant Bourne was awarded the Victoria Cross. He chose to receive a Commission as an Officer in the 24th Foot in lieu of the VC. Bourne retired a Lt Colonel of the Regiment and famously recorded much of his exploits on tape speaking to the BBC. Unfortunately, during the Blitz the recordings were lost, That's what happened to Lt Col Bourne.
One of my favorite movies. This was an excellent video. Thank you so much for sharing this!
Come along sir, there's a good lad.
Nigel Green got all the best lines.  Sergeant Bourne was a hell of a man. God knows how many times NCO's have saved the day ehen the Ruperts have got stagefright. Although I would say that, I'm the son of a 5'3'' NCO.
big deal
"Buttodn your tunic,, Lad"
I, too,  was intrigued by no VC for Colour Sergeant Bourne ......so I went to the regimental museum in Brecon to find out.... Your video does complete justice to this remarkable man.... Thank you for sharing......
Alright then, nobody told you to stop working! ❤
Nobody told you to stop working!
There you are you hook!
Enjoyed the journey.Could you tell me something about the HMS  Sybille from the Boar war era, please
“Hitch I saw you you’re alive” “I am  ? thankyou very much “ “now off to sick bay where you belong “
Yes lm  in my 60s and l feel a strong   feeling  like  a life in the past
Hughes: Colour Sergeant Bourne! What's that shooting? Colour Sergeant Bourne: A rifle, Hughes. Hughes: Eh? Colour Sergeant Bourne: If you're sick in hospital, I'd suggest you go and lie down. Hughes: Yes, Colour Sergeant.
Much respect after 124 years…………………..
A very  courageous man. I must admit, I was curious to know why he did not receive a Victoria Cross. I would certainly believe that he should have been awarded the VC, but I suppose they couldn't give one to everybody. Thanks again, Chris. I am learning all the time.
Ok so 142 Brits held off 4,000 ZULU for 12 hours and fired 20,000 round killing 400........... uh was that the gang that couldn't shoot straight?
“And a bayonet sir with some guts behind it” best colour Sargent borne line in the film
I always remember him saying thats it lad we'll make a soldier of you yet whilst in the hut that's on fire and full of zulus coming in through the ceiling and door so they dug through a wall i loved that film they used to put it on every X mas but I suppose it's not seen as politically correct these days such a shame
One question:  What were the British doing in South Africa?  Real history demands an honest answer.
Excellent video. Thanks for making it.
It is the Distinguishing Conduct Medal, not the Distinguished Combat Medal.
His discipline and leadership added one foot and one inch to his stature!
At the end of the day it was a minor action after the Zulu victory at isandwana . The VC’s where give out to hide the shame of that defeat by blowing up this little action by a minor Zulu leader
"Zulu's...fousands of 'em".
Do carry on with your mud pie. So Ching Ching
OK - I'm sorry but I have to tell you about the word you use a lot (used previously in the David Niven story too).  You pronounce the word 'recipient' with an extra 'r' - ie as in 'recipRient'.  I've only seen two of your videos so far but, trying not to be rude, had to let you know.  I do love your videos, and their subject matter, and mean to continue watching them all
Missing was the reason for the defeat at Isandlwana. Chelmsford went chasing a fake attack from the zulu's leaving the station undefended
"Khartoum" was an excellent movie which took place in 1885 and it clearly presented both Victorian England's political, religious position and the position of the African Muslims in and around Khartoum. Excellent movie!
"Look to your front... Mark your target when he comes."
You're obviously knowledgeable on British history from the 19th Century. Very good work that you do. As an American, I tip my hat off to you.
Wow. Frank was a real forest Gump of British military history.
Fyi. It's mutton chop 'Whiskers' not mustache.
Great story! Great movie "Zulu". Colour Sergeant Bourne was extremely brave. He certainly deserves to be recognized as a great war hero. This is coming from an American. Posthumously, I tip my hat to him!
I had heard (many years ago) that he was written up for a VC, however it materialised he had been caught sleeping during the battle and it was downgraded…
""Alright then. Nobody told you to stop working."
Judasz tusk i jego lewacka banda zniszczą Polskę !
I never get tired of this movie .
Officer on Parade...
Bromhead was militarily useless. Chard was totally inexperienced, and s was Bourne. Without Adendorf's expertise in building fortifications, the whole English contingent would have been wiped out, yet he got no credit whatsoever for his vital contribution and personal bravery.
"Hitch, I saw you, you're alive"
YOu are soo right. I have all the quotes down pat.
You seem to make out the British to be some kind of heroes, for hundreds of years the British invaded as many countries as they could and slaughtered innocent people then occupied the same countries and plundered them ! Stole billions! Then called it the commonwealth!
The men are very tired.
No comedians,please.
Color Sgt. Bourne was a master with the bayonet.
South Wales borders
All right you lot. No one told you to stop working
May I add that the British soldiers burial sites in South africa are a total disgrace to our nation, neglected overgrown and vandalised. Some people in SA😂 still show off troffies such as helmets taken from the dead. The United States of America would value their fallen better. Try going there and fix the grave sites rather than be entertained by the stories told. What is poppy day about?
What a fantastic video , thank you sir for keeping the memory of such courageous men of great Britain alive . When we look at our nation today and what it's become we must never forget the people who made , fought and died for us . God bless them all .
I heard that Frank Bourne took promotion instead of accepting the VC
Awarded an OBE when these weren't just given to celebraties 😅😮 thank you Chris
*LEGEND !!💯* Aotearoa New Zealand I saw the movie as a teenager in the 70's ... Thrilled me to bits !!
Do your tunic up lad where do yo think you are
“Back on the wall lad, with your mates”
He turned in his grave when he got the message as to what's happening to his country, and the cancerous iskamic takeover of his beloved country.
Sou Brasileiro e tenho um grande interesse nos feitos militares ingleses ao longo da historia e amei ter encontrado seu canal no youtube e sinceramente sempre achei que foram injusto com o Sargento Frank Bourne e foi bem oportuno seu video .
That was a lovely video, I learnt so much
Hitch! You’re alive! I saw you!
I like the way he casually drops Jack Hawkins brandy bottle. Just letting it drop and break, not throwing it or smashing it against a wall. Nigel Greens bayonette fight is brilliant. He is obviously doing exactly what the army manual and training had taught him to do. Which is exactly how it would have been done in real life. Stanly Baker choosing to show this rather than a "hollywood fight" is great directing.
Hello Mr history chap.where can I send you further information about rorkes drift? I have followed you for a good while. Hope this gets to you regards charlie
Color sergeant went from 6'4" down to 5'3", That's like going from John Way size to Audie Murphy's 5'5".  Movies sure distorts the reality. Little guys are indeed big men.
St Peter Gore Seer, I Thought The ZULU Was The Brave Far More Guts, Shame Thousands Of ZULU Were Destroyed,Slaved Spread To Other Countries To Be Brutalized.
An army friend of mine said he never got a vc because at his rank bravery was expected and so no reward for doing his job was made 🤷‍♂️
"Alright then. Nobody told you to stop workin'!"
As a retired Canadian Serviceman … Brazo Zulu … Frank … you are gone but not forgotten… well done
“the courage of the defenders” … what about the courage of the Zulu warriors ? that would be a different movie, for sure👍
“Nobody told you to stop working!”
Saw this in a theatre in Bristol. Dad took me and i loved every minute. Memory i will have till death. Absolutely a shame he did not get a VC. The respect that when they watched the Calvary rode off to silence and his voice sounded off "Alright then, None told you to stop working" They all jumped at his command presence.
Great video. Very informative, interesting and entertaining.
Unfortunately, he was part of an illegal invasion of a sovereign nation.
They were just murdering the indigenous people, nothing brave about that. Now in the UK we have boats full of people coming in....karma.
What a shame we lost that interview. A real legend of a man.
My great great grandfather was in the British Army during the Boer War.   I have a photo of him in his uniform.
They definitely did NOT like it up 'em
A very good museum there should you find yourself there. Quite far from most other places however. I've been twice when driving from Durban to Kruger
Then, same as now, Zulus are not compatible with western civilization....
I saw the movie in 1964. There are many inaccuracies in it. C/Sgt Bourne was a small man and quite young at the time and I have always wondered how he was promoted fairly rapidly. Perhaps due to having been well-educated, as there are references to him writing letters for his men (who called him "the kid". Any takers on this angle?
Amazing.. What a life..
" Nobody told you to stop working"     I always understood why CSgt Bourne didn't revive  a VC  nothing he did during the battle was outstanding conduct of a Color Sergeant.
Did the British army not have the rank of Sergeant Major in 1879?
Loved the video, thank you very much , makes you proud to be British
"the gentleman's got a bottle sir" 😂
These aren't heroes for what they did .. colonial          feckers .
As a Son of a 1965 & 1971 Indo -Pak War Veteran Indian Air Force Officer  ( Fighter Pilot ) who retired as a Two star Officer ( Air Vice Marshal )  just cannot stop laughing watching this video 👌👌😂😂😁😁😁😁🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  These days, many Britons watch videos showcasing the exploits of their bastard ancestors, often highlighting how their bastard forefathers fought weaker opponents and touted their so-called greatness to the world. They seem to relish patting themselves on the back, clinging to a narrative of past glory as a means of self-validation.  If those ancestors were alive today, they’d be utterly stunned to see how the world, especially Indians, mocks and laughs at their legacy. From ordinary ( M F , S F , A HOLE Generation Z  citizens ) to soldiers, sailors, and even RAF fighter pilots of that era, their dominance now seems a far cry from reality.  Take a look at the 21st-century military standings:  India ranks 4th globally in terms of firepower.  Britain? A modest 10th position.👌👌😂😂😁😁🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  Consider manpower:  India boasts the second-largest army in the world, with approximately 30 million personnel, including active, reserve, and paramilitary forces.  If we include self-voluntary forces, the potential swells to an unmatched 50-100 million.  In comparison, the British Armed Forces? A total strength of roughly 1,10 , 000, including regular personnel, Gurkhas, and volunteer reserves—a mere fraction of India’s numbers. Pea Nuts , Green Peas .👌👌😂😂😁😁🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  The scale of disparity is astounding! India's sheer manpower and firepower make   Britain’s forces appear almost insignificant—a drop in the ocean compared to India's military might. 👌👌😂😂😁😁🤣🤣  What once seemed formidable is now laughable in the grander scheme of modern global power dynamics.😂😂😁😁🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  Pea Nut will fight Russia .👌👌👏👏😁😁😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣   From India
The Zulus were the true heroes!

Brilliant! Thank you.
Two and half pennies a day. No wonder we couldn't afford our empire
Thank you so much. I always wondered why he wasn't awarded the VC and then to hear of his remarkable subsequent career. BZ.
My father died many years ago.  He never understood why Colour Sergeant Bourne was not awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions at Rorkes Drift.  Even now, I could not enlighten him
Because we’re here lad…nobody else.
I've gotthis film. Button your tunic stands out for me. I also have Zulu Dawn.
something we should remember is that the Heroes wrote the story.  not like there were any camera there. or un-partial observers.. they could have said that there was a million zulu there. nobody knows. there might only have been 50 zulu there
As a young reserve officer I quickly realized that my greatest resource was my sergeant and the company warrant officer.  There was no problem they could not solve, dependable to the end.
I am Henry Hook VC   , great grandson.Could you tell us about his family my grandmother was Letitia Hook his youngest daughter Cyril Bunting
I have been fortunate to go to both Isandlawana and Rorke's Drift and found both very atmospheric .  You are aware  that  it is a site of death and tragedy with the most beautiful scenery. The film was not shot on the actual battlefields  but  in the beautiful Drakensberg mountains.
Thanks!
now thats a knife
Heroes?!
I have often wondered why he was never awarded the VC. In fact I was flabbergasted! We have the video of this and the later video of the slaughter before the next battle at Rorkes drift!
“I shall be exalted in the heavens, I shall be exalted in the earth, the Lord of hosts is with us.”

Why was Britania invading Zululand?
Zulus, Sir. Thousands of 'em.
Brilliant. What an incredible man and a onderful exzmple of sheer grit and courage. Thanks Paul
"Say, 'Sir'.. Officer on parade."
Its hard to pick a favorite line as he had so many great ons! 👍😎
Thanks for this fascinating video!! Loved it.
Coulor sergeant Bourne was Five feet Six inches tall. That’s from his memoirs!  Nigel Green although a great character in Zulu, was Six feet six inches tall. But! It’s a travesty that Coulor Sergeant Bourne did not receive the VC.
Destroying his voice transcript is one of the most disgusting degradations of history imaginable.
Got to wonder at the idiocy in the BBC sometimes, the way they've wiped over or binned things 😖; a great video yet again!
I don’t understand the reason he refused a commission?
Thanks for that. Very informative
Here’s a better question: why do we still glamorize the unlawful invasion of a continent by the British Army?
I would like to know if there was a Foxon at Rorke’s Drift. My grandson said he saw the name on a list of men. I have been there and don’t know how they defended themselves. The ground has a very gentle slope. And that is all because it looks almost flat.  My husband’s ancestors were very involved in the fighting. They were 19 year old officer Foxon who escorted the Zulu King to the ship that was to take them to Cape Town and imprisonment. He was allowed the company of several of his wives. Foxon was my husband’s grandfather and having studied law became a magistrate in various areas the last one being in Mtunzini in Zululand. Foxon had arrived in Durban in the earliest years of the colony and was described in official documents as a gentleman of means. I  have written 2 books and the second book has much to do with the settlers difficulties and battles write up to their fighting in jWW2.
“Fix your tunic son… my god where do you think you are?”
This is one of the finest movies ever made!  Bourne was simply magnificent!  Now our heroes are overpaid sportsmen, pop stars, and dubious influencers.  As to the encouragement of youth rifle clubs, I’m old enough to remember when this was not vilified. I joined a defence rifle club at 15 and became a capable rifleman out to 1000 yards with the new 7.62 target rifle.  They were called defence rifle clubs so there was no mistaking their purpose, despite being genteel. I also shot smallbore at every opportunity. It didn’t induce me to go on shooting sprees either. Now to propose such pursuits with an archaic view to defending one’s country in time of need would incur massive condemnation for being extremist. Thank you for adding dimension to this true patriot! 👍🏻
" your alive, I saw you"!
For such a long-lived and experienced veteran, Col. Bourne reminds me of the movie "The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp" where the 19th century Col. Blimp confronts his anachronistic Victorian outlook in the 20th century, coming to grips that he has become obsolete.
Can't remember when I first saw "Zulu" (too long ago) but can't count the number of times I've seen it since mostly on TV nowadays. The back story and factual corrections I found out later do not in any way diminish from the frequent "artistic licence" of the narrative in the film. Of all the characters Bourne is arguably the most memorable.  As an aside Nigel Green who portrayed C/Sgt Bourne in Zulu played a less prominent though equally memorable  role in "Tobruk" with Rick Hudson and George Peppard.
Amazing story of this gallant soldier!
Zulu’s, thousands of them!
What a tragedy that liberal educationalists have made Britains glorious past a thing to be ashamed of.
FB what at a hero from bak in the day.......they do not make them like that any more!!!
Ce film est un chef-d'œuvre j'ai du le voir une dizaine de fois religieusement.les anglais on combattu c'est terrifiant guerriers capables de faire 50 km en courant et livré bataille

The King of Zulus did not what his warriors to Rorkes Drift. My parental Grandmother was front Welshpool was relation to one of the defenders of Rockes Drift . I work with a RAF Chef was relation to the civil service and RQM to hold Victoria Cross in Rockes Drift.
He reminded me allways of my grandad who also was a RSM Proffesional soldier always smartley turned out his whole life allways stood up straight an air of authority about him never aggressive  but u did as told
All right, no one told you to stop working.
Bless him ,lovely to hear his history at last
The fact Sergeant Bourne respected his enemy decades after his service speaks volumes to his professionalism.  I'm a veteran of OIF, and served as a medic on a MiTT team and as senior medic for engineers.  You never disrespect your enemy!  The moment you discount their dedication, intelligence, and commitment to watching you die you give them the opportunity to waste you.  They can bury you in a grave marked arrogance.   Real soldiers respect the enemy.
As an Australian I was astonished to find out that an Australian fought at Waterloo (born in Sydney) his name is 2nd Lt Andrew White of the Royal Engineers, can you research this further?
That battle was required reading when I was on active duty. Now I’m only 61 years old and when I enlisted in 1981, it was common to see men well into their 50’s and even 60 on active duty.  High year tenure policy of the mid 80’s put an end to that.  I fear that this helped expedite the process of what plagues our modern military.
I always LOVED actor Nigel Green's work.
''HOOK,!------------------------ HOOK!--------- I know you're here, I have seen you ''!
I saw the movie at our local theater and it was epic !
The heroes of Rorke's Drift will only ever be The Zulus. It was they who were defending their land and protecting their people.
Rouks drift... Is that near Chapel town in Leeds ?
Advance!
"Because we're here lad, just us!"
Can I ask if you can let me know what you may have a private Owen please?  He was the character represented by Ivor Emanuel in the film Zulu.  I’m interested in your earlier comment that men of Harlech wasn’t sung.  So I wonder where that story came from?  I know that Stanley Baker was an executive producer, so I wonder if he influenced the writers?  Apparently the regiment was being considered to move to Brecon or did take some time at the Barracks there.  Maybe there was influence of the 30 or so Welsh contingent of the regiment…. Possibly?  Were there VC’s given to any Welsh member of the regiment?  Thank you…. Really like your channel.   On another note are you looking to do any blogs on recent wars, for example the Falklands.
Leadership coupled with good men.
And all of the time,the only people to benefit from it all,were the aristocracy and the filthy rich!!
Do a story on the Canadian Forces in the Medak pocket.
I first saw Zulu as a kid; years later I happened to read an article about it and was stunned to find out that instead of grizzled vet like shown in the film he was actually a young man and called 'The Kid'
We were shown the film Zulu in 1965 on a troop ship, on the way from Singapore to Kuching Borneo . It was played on Deck . Being on active service fighting the undeclared war called the confrontation between the new Malaysia and the  Communists supporting Indonesia led by president Sukarno. The film was and still is fantastic, it gave us all ( most in our late teens) Inspiration and guts to carry out the hard and physicall jungle warfare expected of us.
Never take a spear to a gun fight. You'll lose.
He died?
"I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth. The Lord of Hosts is with us"  Probably one of my favorite scenes next to "Because we're here lad. Nobody else.... just us"
It's because, if you know anything about Brithish military history, and the snobbery of the class system, the despatches were always written by the commanders and always about their own officers. If historical despatches are to be believed then it was commanders and officers alone who won every conflict from the 1700s all the way up to the start of the First World War.
EXCELLENT! MOST  EXCELLENT PRESENTATION.   Thank You!👏👏👏
The REAL Bourne Legacy! Thank you very much for this.
"alright.... nobody told you to stop working"
Do you the reader, know what the film ZULU really is about,>
To this day my favourite dialogue in this movie is Caine after giving commands for several rounds of volley-fire. He switches to, "Independent, fire at will!" only for one of the Welsh soldiers to grin to his mate and utter, "Oh, that's very nice of him!"  Every time I watch it, that scene brings a smile to my face.
There is no way.. tell me it aint so!?
In the Finest tradition of a British Soldier, a great credit to the Queen he served!
If you’re sick in hospital I suggest you lie down
where was Frank Bourne buried at
He died in 1945 at the age of 90. He retired at the rank of Lt. Colonel.
"A prayer's as good as bayonet on a day like this." Color Sgt Bourne
They dont make them like that anymore. Loyal to the last.
I once faced  a lot of Vietnamese enemy and I know how they felt
Thank you for your videos they are extremely interesting and informative.
Nigel Green, always a Good actor....   he stood out! Nigel died 1972 from an overdose of pills: He had l child with 2nd wife.
It is a real pleasure to watch The History Chap. Your presentation of the history is truly masterful. I am 70 years of age and I recognize genius when I see it. Well done Sir
During the 1940s I spoke to an old kehla at Rorke's Drift, who had carried his father's sleeping mat and food before the battle. He told me that he ran way because the red soldiers were killing them. My great uncle Arthur Dixon lies in an unmarked grave somewhere near.
The gentleman has a bottle
Just came across this. I learnt something new today. I live just round the corner from where Frank Bourne was born. Thank you very much for sharing this.
... however... if you were a constant problem... kept on due to competence... but always a "not a team player"... well - any surprise?
Remind us again, what was the British army doing in Africa? Stealing more land and resources and trying to cull the native populations that had the audacity to tell them to go back to their own country. Heroes in your book. In the book of world history, you are simply evil. Asia hates you; the middle east hates you. The majority of decent people on the planet are literally sick to death of you too. Why is that? Give us your best guess Chappy? Hint, you've ben banging on about it for about 4 years now about your wonderful army. The irony is that one day you will wake up and realise that you have made a damning indictment for all to watch, the disgrace of British History.
alright then,nobody told you to stop working....
Steady.
Great story!
It would not surprise me if the majority of the BbC staff, university educated, elite and selected for cultural diversity rather than merit, would have far rather shown a left wing narrative showing colonial oppression by the facist oppressors of the British empire , cruelly stamping on the peoples of Africa who suffered years of brutality by their British filth! African independance from British oppression has been a great success. Zimbabwe being one example of their new found economic wealth......
Excellent account of a very brave man, thank you.
I know I'm a year late watching this,  but would you consider a video on Sir Isaac Brock, the hero of the battle of Queenston  Heights, during the War of 1812? Or, have you already produced one?
Fact…in the movie Gladiator they used Zulu war chants from this movie. It’s in the beginning battle scene.
Zulu's sir....fousands of em.
I find myself wondering if there are any relatives of his still alive. If so, how proud they must be.
The The musket school For where it stood, it's now Sainsbury's, but. But if you go into sainsbury there is a small picture history  on the wall . I'm always repeating  the history  of colours  Sargent borne how he served  here. Be interesting  if Frank Bourne came back & see what happened  to the Muskets school where it stood , he be shocked  what happened  to Hythe
" Nobody Told you to stop Workin."
i didnt know he was born in Balcombe.
I didn't understand the benefit of refusing the officer commision.  Why would he make that decision?  You suggested it was connected to pay...
"Button your collar lad. Officer on parade"
Colour Sargent was the rock of the engagement, providing calm and direction he should been awarded a Victoria Cross, he earned it.
Excellent! Well done you!
IS THERE NO live  CHAT today chris?
Sir Harry Flashman had a hand there. No doubt he slithered out somehow
Steady lads!
He probably tried reenlisting in 1939 too.
"Fewer", not "less".
I really wondered why he did not get a VC based on the film.  His stoic character was the model of British soldiery
These videos are really excellent, thanks so much for sharing them with us. Fascinating, and the type of content that deserves so many views.
Leave it to the BBC to trash real history.
I have watched Zulu many times it's a firm favourite, and admired Colour Sergeant Bourne as an excellent NCO. It was good to learn that the man so well portrayed, I thought, by Nigel Green, was as portrayed of the best type of soldier with firmness but fairness toward the men under him who's respect he had. My Father was an RSM in the Royal Artillery serving during the second World War.
I'm 31, grew up watching Zulu, Battle of Britain and other classics. Painted soldiers and airfix, played football, made dens and went pond dipping all summer. Eventually joined cadets and at 19, the Royal Marines.  I feel that's a pretty A typical childhood these days, I'm glad I managed to squeeze into that last generation before video games and social media, smart phones, etc. took over.  I feel sorry for people today. Hooked (no pun intended) on tiktok, where they're told to be ashamed of their heritage and view history through a miserly, pessimistic lense.
The gentleman has a bottle sir !!.
Because we're here lad and nobody else.
imagine living through that and not getting a VC. losers
I believe color Sgt.  Borne should be still awarded the Victoria cross . He held the lot together . He was the backbone of thr entire battle.
Everyone in the comment section is a recipient of the congressional medal of honor according to themselves. Every comment screams fairytales of military service. 🤣🤣😂
I have often wondered what ever became of Henry Hook?
Were they still using Muskets in the 1880s?
Why did he refuse a commission? Wouldn't the pay have been higher?
Entertaining and educational. Marvelous.
The quote you give is my fave: Because we're here, lad.  Thanks for sharing what became of him. He had perfect discipline.
Great story! Sorry, but I must say at the very end that only a Brit can say "Worcestershire" with such ease. Us Americans cannot pronounce it correctly
Holy cow! Five-foot-three!? Two inches taller than Mickey Rooney, same as Barry Fitzgerald, and three inches shorter than O'rance. Dare I say, a short-arse writ large?
That was so interesting. Thank you very much
He lived in Kings Hall Road, Beckenham in South London!
The blinkeredness of most of those commenting on this is staggering.  Is there no conscience at all about what we British were doing in the countries that we invaded and plundered?  Is it brainwashing, or what?
What a Brilliant man
Great piece, thank you.
Fantastic story. I served I'm 5 Squadron Royal Engineers, the Rorke's Drift Squadron, in which Lt. Chard VC served. But I was not aware of this story. Thank you.
5'-3" was common then. My Great Uncle was 5'-3" in ww2 and was awarded the Military Medal and later the bar to go with it  on the Somme. He fired a Stoke Mortar in his Battery Unit. We think Delville Wood but given no info on that. He was with his 6 brothers, they were in different regiments ...none were tall, one was my Grandad. I have researched other soldiers from UK and Ireland and they also were not tall.  Frank Bourne's father  "Merely a labourer" ..I would say that is one of the hardest jobs and to provide for 8 children took considerable fortitude. I visited the Brecon museum of the 24th foot, saw the assagais and Zulu shields up close....what an experience. They said originally they were the 2nd Warwickshire's..maybe you could do a program on those.
Brilliant video, thank you, what an amazing life he led.
Really great story, thankyou!
Hmm. It’s the Eastern Cape, and not the Eastern Country. Ta.
Thank you for doing this video. Loved the movie. Have always been impressed by former soldiers. During my service, I never forgot the bravery and courage of those who led the way, and tried to emulate them.
say Sir, officer on parade
I live near his home in Beckenham. It has a plaque.
I have to say that as l read the story, in a history professor book about the battle, and who wrote 40 years ago, amongst other things, that colour sergeant Bourne was ranking NCO for all the soldiers under him, and they were a company of engineers, not used to fight as they did. Were did you read they were proper infantrymen l wonder.
I just love the Welshmens , singing, but I'm of Welsh descent and a lifelong singer, what a great movie , !!! Gives me goosebumps, having been a rifleman fifty some yrs ago ! I always admired the Martini , they must have been a tough tool, to have survived those endless volleys
My father is a WW2 veteran 97 yrs old, He lost his Brother in the battle of the bulge , 17th Airborne, another brother lost his leg in the battle for france,was  a, D-Day survivor!  His sister Dolly was a Nurse in Pacific theater,!His father was a WW1 , victim of mustard gas, lived until 1937, I'm a disabled Vietnam veteran 25 the inf div, that's just a fraction of us. I remember so well the first time I saw Zulu was in the mid 1960s , and o must say , Rourke's drift has to be one of the most interesting battles ever, I also have studied Gettysburg for years and years, the Maine unit on the far left flank of little round top is also , similar to the drift ! Your videos are par excellence! I enjoyed so very much, good day mi Friend
Thanks for an excellent documentary based on evidence rather than skewed opinion - really enjoyed it.
GREAT! THANKS.
Wasn't the attack on Rourke's Drift made against the Zulu King's orders?
Being a army veteran, almost 50 yrs ago, i absolutely was facenated with the movie Zulu, Mr Caine was also a army veteran, what a movie, what a great Army the British have always fielded, i Salute these bravest of Men !
Really enjoyed this, thank you.
Snapeth the spear in sunder  l will be exalted in the earth the  Lord  of hosts is with us .do u know it sir
I wrote this for American Vets but it applies to all those who keep their country free. "America should be grateful they have men like us to protect them from men like us"
Excellent
Great story!!!
The Victorians treated and spoke of global conquest as 'the game', I think treating world conquest like a game made it easier for them to take over the world in their own daft minds
A really lovely appraisal of CS Bourne thank you!  Have you made any videos on Monte Casino? I had an uncle, an officer, who was in the Beds & Herts during WW2,  an absolute inspiration and guiding light, as CS Bourne I never heard him raise his voice but he commanded tremendous respect and even looked and sounded like CS Bourne in the film Zulu. He was very popular with his men and went all through WW2 with the Regiment two of the troop ships they were on were torpedoed. For his immense courage and bravery he was awarded a DSO by the King for numerous actions
Tunes of Glory was another British army standout , pipes and drums kilts askirling ,brave highlanders marching to the Bagpipes do or die !
Great story. Thank you
Chelmsford's move on the Zulus is all too often thought of as a 'British' move on the same.  But it was Theo. Shepstone who 'engineered' the whole thing in the background for a number of years. An adroit manipulator, and observer of people and things, convinced/manipulated Chelmsford to move on the Zulus.  Much to the horror of the Foreign Office.
Read Ian Knight's - Zulu Rising.  It gives a bullet by bullet account of iSandlwana, and Rorke's Drift.  (and the said Bourne....a might fine account he gave of himself, too!)
It's hard to have a 'favorite' quote, but I always got a kick out of, "Aaall right, no one told you to stop working". Truly the epitome of what being an NCO is all about.
I suppose he watched his men going above and beyond, proud and probably frustrated that he couldn't join his men as one of them.  Like a dog on a chain, I doubt any Zulu that got past the men on the wall would have lasted very long upon bumping into that English Mastiff on a chain!
Boy , they don't breed men like that now ! What a great generation , respect to them .....
Are there any Copies of the recording
Thanks. ✌🏻👊🏼
Thanks!
This was my favorite character in the movie.
What a great man.
The henry rifle should have got a victoria cross  also .....!
This was  extraordinary.   Thanks so much. Well done sir
How about British heroes of the Korean War
Interesting he was only 5'3".  Audie Murphy was pretty short too, only a couple inches taller than that.
I don't know much about the military. What's the difference between a Sergeant and a Colour Sergeant?
Alright .alright. nobody told you to stop working. GET SWEATING !
Great job on this video.
How about covering the 1972 battle of Mirbat.
Thanks for the video !
They shouldn't have been there.  Another war to make the ritch, ritcher and the lust for power and land from the Vistoria.
"Hitch. Hitch, I've seen you.  You're alive!"
1849 , the same year the brittish army and government are comitting genocide in ireland . The famine , weve a score to settle with the tans
The UNBELIEVABLE short-sightedness of the BBC never fails to absolutely astound me!!!.....
What about the Epic Battle between The History Chap and The History Guy?  Sorry Olde Chap, couldn't resist.
Now That’s Soldiering!
He totally epitomises being British. What a brave nice man. We could do with him now and many more like him. I salute you sir.
He became a spy for Treadstone.😉
What did will do for them to all fire at him
"There's a good gentleman"
Henry V, Waterloo, Zulu, Battle of the River Plate, Dunkirk, are some of the films recalling previous generations showing  'Britishness'.  It makes us(erase) me  proud to be descendants of such people;  the greatest of nobility in the 'lower orders'.   Whether, today's generation believes the cause of such battles were in accordance with today's standards is entirely irrelevant.
What a fantastic story
"Say Sir....   Officer on Parade."
I am deeply grateful for Captain Bourne and countless men and women like him who secure our liberty and inspire others to do likewise in a dangerous world.
Most interesting and educational. What a man, what a career and what impressive personal standards and skills. This video complemented and added to the film (which I much enjoyed).
I wonder where he lived in Beckenham and if the house still stands and has a `Blue Plaque' to acknowledge is famous former resident...
One of my favorite movies. Color Sergeant Bourne, A real Man's Man.
Thanks!
Why us colour sergeant? "Cos we're  here lad, no-one else"
I grew up in the old British/Canadian Infantry NCO culture, the cornerstone standard being that 'you take care of your Men  before you take care of yourself', and at least twice in my service I knew of soldiers refusing a decoration in favour of another soldier whom they maintained was more deserving of recognition. Perhaps that was a factor in this case.
Too bad the US has never really honored it's NCOs like that. Back in those days NCOs were total peons.
“Alright! Nobody told you to stop working! Get sweating!” My favourite line. Great presentation. I come back to these videos regularly. Respect from Australia.🇦🇺
No comedians please.
"Hitch - Hitch, I saw you, you are alive"
....because were here,lad,theres nobody else!!!
No comedians please.
"And a bayonet sir....with some guts behind it..."
My question is how did Nigel Green get ready for his role?  He comes across so well and I wonder if he had served in the British Army, perhaps as an NCO?  If not, he had some pretty good coaches.  And obviously researched and worked hard to make Colour Sergeant Bourne come alive!  He really nails it.  I participate in 19th-Century U.S. Army and Spanish colonial living history, having actually started doing that while in the U.S. Army 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, because our regimental commander wanted an authentic 1857 platoon of the type of men who fought against the Mescalero Apache.  I think a lot of reenactors have been inspired by Zulu.  The entire cast really comes across so very authentically - who trained them and got them ready for their astounding performance?  Whomever it was, big time kudos (BTW, I am a 30-year Infantry Veteran, retired as a senior NCO).
The British are the heroes here?? They invade another country and steal their natural resources and tell them to comply or die. Many of those who refused the invasion of their country were murdered by the British Army. The real heroes are the Africans who tried to defend their land against superior forces but were slaughtered by the British army.
Steady Lad steady now! Yes loved Frank Bourne a true Brit solder protail, Yet in Real Life he was only 5 ft 3 inch. Wow that was a shock.
I enjoyed that.  Thank you
Beautiful!! Thank you for this!!
He still there in EVERY Battalion trust me
I would like to hear your opinion of the relationship between Chard and Bromhead.   Loved the background on CS Borne
THE DEFENCE OF MAFEKING (Gametree hill)
Fantastic overview and great presentation - I watched the Zulu movie as an Army Cadet in Western Australia aged 14 in 1972!  I never forgot it and indeed went on to enlist in the Army.  One can't help but wonder what became of the various significant players in such battles as at Rorke's Drift or in other true stories, made into film. Often the historical event or persons involved are changed into something seen as more desirable for a theater going audience, and without detailed researching, one cannot be sure what to believe. Thank you for this video and excellent commentary expressed in an interesting and enthusiastic manner. I finished my military service as a Major (Royal Australian Infantry Corps) and am now 66, and through series such as yours, am still learning the truth of such events and characters, all these years later.  I was overjoyed to learn that Colour Sergeant Frank Bourne went on to do great things in the service of the Army and his country and was suitably recognised for this!  Thanks again!
he should be better known than what he was-a soldier at his finest
I saw Zulu when a little boy in Bath, wonderful film...I now am 68...thank you for the memories
This man Frank Bourne eptomises the calibre of the type of men around in the 1800`s . They were the TRUE British Bulldog spirit  of the type sadly we see very little of these days.  They were not appreciated one bit as even Lord Wellington considered them "scum of the earth" almost certainly said out of Class snobbery ,while they did the work he gained the laurels. Can you imagine going at a slow walk pace in a line facing towards and up  to within 15 feet of the enemy then stopping and opening firing . It was just a roll of the dice which side fired  first as  your chances of surviving the  line of deadly musket balls fired at you was slim and even if you survived instant death ,and were wounded ,you`d probably die of shock and or gangrene.
"All right now....nobody told you to stop working."
When completing recruit training (for the third time in my mixed military career) we had to complete an endurance course and finish off with a static-mechanical rifle course. To prepare us for the 'Challenge' as it was called. we sat down the night before and watched 'zulu' as a motivational incentive. It must have worked, because we all flew through the course the next day!
A very good video and most informative.  Thank you very much.
Thank you I really enjoyed that
Interesting story. I'd be interested in any historical bon mot relating to personnel from Darlington or thereabouts. I know Pilot Officer William McMullen of Canada is remembered by Darlington (Darlo) folk, his Lancaster caught fire on a training flight and he stayed at the controls so his six crewmates could bale out, and long enough to steer his plane past Darlington, saving countless lives but losing his own. I mention him to any Canadians I meet, and that the town still remembers him with gratitude. An episode paying tribute to this brave Canadian would be excellent.
Nigel Green was the perfect choice to portray colour sergeant Bourne
Thank you for reminding the  world that the DCM was second only to the VC.  Fighting hand to hand in the dark for 24 hours with no relief.  Very similar to the Battle of Lone Pine in August 1915.  The 1st Brigade of the AIF.    Seven VCs were awarded to men of that Brigade for their  actions during that battle.
High respect Sir
Amazing life.
Thank you so much for this.
Hitch, I saw you, you’re alive.
Thank you
Several years ago I took advantage of a BA offer and flew to Durban to fulfill my desire and travel the battlefields of the AZ war.  Two weeks self drive on my own B&B; the locals thought me mad; a lovely but dangerous country.  I visited many 'tin hat' clubs, similar to our RBL.  An experience of a lifetime..........
Excellent vid.  I just subbed so I can check out your others vids. Especially the Crimean ones you mentioned.
"Who told you to stop working?"
so glad he had a good innings and although no vc , he was certainly respected for his endevours
Knowing his actual age and stature puts a different slant on the movie and actual events, making it all the more incredible
What a legend. As a former Army officer, it is the senior NCOs that make or break a unit. Rest in peace Sir, your service is done. What an example he was.
What a life, what a career and what changes the man saw between his enlistment and his death.        Awarded £10/year? Well now, let's not pamper and spoil the man and drive him to ruination! However, "£100 in 1890 is equivalent in purchasing power to about £15,846.31 today, an increase of £15,746.31 over 133 years...The inflation rate in 1890 was 0.00%. The current inflation rate compared to last year is now 6.70%.."    Oh well, at least it makes me feel better for our hero and very brave Colour Sergeant.
Can I suggest a video on The Battle of Albuhera little known but a solider's battle. Thanks
What a life !!! A time before planes , To travel the world !!! Exciting times in British history 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧 Some people at that time never traveled more than 10 miles from their house all their lives !
Nobody told you to stop working
Hitch... Hitch, I saw you. You're alive.
Welsh and Irish troops at Rorkes Drift are Celts not Anglos.
Have you done a video of the Battle of Arnhem?  With the 80th Anniversary coming up in 2024 what better excuse for the video.  Whilst the film A Bridge Too Far is OK it doesn't go into the detail of what really took place.  There is a book which doesn't hold back, called "Arnhem"
You and your channel are absolutely brilliant! Thank you.
I have been to Rorkes Drift, it is an amazing experience. Ishandlhwana is just plain eerie, nothing moves there but the wind.
Henry Reynolds, VC, the Post  Surgeon. I have often wondered if I am related to him, no, not because of our common surname but because I have a great-uncle Henry Reynolds who served in WWI and also won the VC.  Quite a coincidence. Look him up, he has quite a story too, not just the action he was involved in but after the war.
Hook! Staywhereyouare,Hook!!
Great lesson in military History, I would love to know more about Orde Wingate (known as the father of the IDF) and a Hero of the, "Night Squads" and then the "Chindits2 Buried in Arlington Cemetery
I first heard about the battle of Rorkes Drift back in the 1950's at the age of around ten I beleive.   It's was the subject of a BBC radio play and it has stayed as a cherrished memory to this day.  It was quite funny when the film Zulu came out and I realised that I was watching a film based on the radio play I recalled from my childhood.  I have no idea what the BBC named that radio play and wonder if they have it burried away in their archives somewhere, I'd love to listen to it again.
My favourite is when a soldier says to him "why us colour sergeant" He replied "Cos we,re here lad and theres nobody else"
"say sir....officer on parade"....
The distribution of Ammunition was what made Rorkes drift a disaster with English pompous hierachy on who should distribute it such stupid snobbery rules.
He did much better in later life than did a number of the other members of the company in the battle.
Needless to say there's a reason why at 5'3 he was getting promoted very quickly to be a colour seargent at 24
Even in Welington's heyday about one in twenty British officers were 'Johnny Jump-Ups', commissioned rankers. But few got as far as a captaincy. The mid- and late Victorian military reforms facilitated Bourne's rise. The most spectacular example of the gradual move towards French-style meritocratic promotion was Wiliam Robertson: enlisted as a private, retired as field marshal and Chief of the Imperial General Staff. 'Wullie' commanded the largest army in UK history during the Great War. His career would be impossible under today's regulations.
Great Show!
No comeedians please!!
Upon retiring from the Army, he created the Bourne Burger convenience food chain.
Brilliant. Thankyou
Love this film.  Especially as it is not biased on either side.  In fact highlighting the brave attitudes on both sides.  Apparently not liked by M Caine.  Had the pleasure of meeting one of the actors and his family in spain in his latter years, not long before he passed away.  A keen boater, had drinks at the marina where a friends boat was berthed. RIP Glynn. 🙏
Heard that Windridge was the senior NCO at Rorke's Drift, going off the movie i always thought it was Bourne, which is correct ?
Good Story.
Button your tunic, you shoddy soldier
Thank you for sharing this amazing story.
Say sir officer on parade
The Dominion of Canada as well as Newfoundland fought battles on behalf of our shared crown... how about some Canucks...?? 🇨🇦  That episode ABSOLUTELY got a sub, by the way...!! Great show, sir...!! 👍
Lt. Colonel. Well done.
Best line. Nobody told you to stop working.
You lead backsided,,,, get sweating.
Excellence of the highest by a British Soldier. I look up to you sir.
what a hero RIP
That was a taut, terrifying movie, for sure
THANK YOU. I've been a huge fan of 'Zulu' since I was a teen. And I have always been enough of a realist to not be shocked that Bourne was a kid and short. Obviously his role made him 'a big man'. And I find it wonderful that he was offered a commission after his wonderful service in Africa, and that he was eventually able to take advantage of that offer and rise to Lt. Colonel. For me his stature grows from what I learned in your presentation.
There is a Blue Plaque marking the house in Beckenham where Frank Bourne lived.
Always loved the film Zulu. Frank Bourne is one of my heroes.
No comedians officer on parade
No comedians please.
Thanks for letting us know about his life!
The main thing with the Victoria cross whether accurate or not depicted in the movie was the majority that fought that were in sickbay and fought actively in the battles. Richard Burton narration at the end explains this. Victoria cross was created for valour and extreme courage not normally expected of the British soldier in face of the enemy. Where the majority were injured in battle or were already injured or sick fought on.
The moment he realises that chard has taken command.... Informing of the centuries have come in.  "Colour sergeant" (Chard)  "Sir" (Bourne)  "You have something to report" (Chard)  "Sir" (Bourne)  "Then tell me" (Chard)  " Very good sir, centuries report Zulu's to the south west, thousands of them"! (Bourne)
Very well told and interesting article. Love the film, such brave and fascinating soldiers. I wonder about his childeren?.
Fabulous history journey. Thank you
"Stay where you are, Hook!" Bourne was always my favorite character in the film, and Nigel Green one of my favorite British actors! Thank you for this.
Reoccurring theme in British history. Stupid leaders. Arrogant. A small army with superior weapons...against a large army who are warriors, not soldiers. Make a fortified camp and draw the enemy into attacking it. Or better yet, respect your enemy and bring in a proper force to do the job.
My father's brother was a colour  Sargent them days
(Csgt Bourne)Hitch, do your tunic up.  (Hitch) me tunic? (Csgt Bourne) Do it up, Where do you think you are man!
Amazing Story. Thank You. I was a SSgt. In Vietnam and a Sgt. In the police force where I retired. I considered that rank, the rank of Sergeant and its permutations, the best in all services.
Why do British Tommies face the enemy? Because the enemy can only kill you whereas the CSM can make your life hell.
Maybe you know already. Private Thomas Chester a veteran of Rorkes Drift was killed in a mining accident at Ferndale south Wales on the 13th Feb 1908 . And the film maker was also from Ferndale Stanley Baker was born in that mining village and his father worked as a winding operator as he also had a leg accident. Maybe he got the idea about the film from word of mouth.
Great video.
Thanks keepem conming
You need him now. The UK has been disarmed & cucked. London is full of those that wish to pull down all monuments of fading colour.
As if someone would throw away an interview with this guy! Absolutely bonkers!
his grave is mentioned on findagrave memorial no. 7368721 and his story...
“Say, ‘sir.’ Officer on parade.” Always loved this bit, emphasizing the _officer_ in noncommissioned officer.
The gentleman has a bottle sir!!.😊
The greatest post war recruiting colour sgt for the British army ! I know I joined the 1st Battalion the Duke of Edinburgh’s royal regiment on the back of Nigel greens performance in Zulu ! Rest easy c/sgt bourne and of course the great actor Nigel green.
Steady boy Steady !!
I'm a Yank!  AND "I LOVE!" this Srg.
Your presentation, the pace and tenor of your voice is ideal for story telling. I have watched a couple of your videos now and they are first class. The portrayal of Sgt. Bourne in the film coloured the expectations I had of my NCO's when I became an infantry officer. And almost to a man they rarely gave me a reason to be disappointed in them. Sometimes I would describe to another officer that this or that NCO was a real 'Sergeant Bourne'. Sometimes they knew the reference, and with younger officers, sometimes not.
Absolutely EXCELLENT !!!!!!!
Isaw this film at the EMPIRE cinema....
The zulu army at issan lawanda had a forty to 1 advantage.
Loved it. Thank you
You are alive Hitch,  I' ve seen You.!   During roll call.
The sound of the Zulus in the movie Rorks Drift was used early in the movie Gladiator with Russell Crowe to represent the barbarians of Germania in the opening battle scenes.
Well told story, good observations. Better yet with a British accent. Thank you.
NCOs are the backbone of every military.
Nobody told you to stop workin
There are three people at least    deserving of the Victoria Cross! .....Colour Sergeant Bourne  1879 Rorkes Drift......... Paddy Maine SAS  for his amazing leadership in the African Desert 19  42 to 1943.. .. and Fidgian Sergeant  Labalala...for his selfless   sacrifice in the defence of Mirbat! 1970s...   SAS... They gave a VC for Colonel  H Jones...who merely  lost his  military structural command in the  Falklands!
Id love to hear the military career of Enoch Powell. Which i know was record breaking..
Brits had grit....the british lions we need to realise our bloodline and  Make Britain great again...
That was a great video. Thank you🙏
i'm not patriotic so I wouild be extremely reluctant to risk my life for this country!  I mean, look at the people in it? To even die for this insane lot is madness in itself!
He opened up a boutique selling scented soaps.
Southerner from the States. Frank Bourne was a stud. No two ways about it. When you led by a man like that, calm, confident and skilled, you become capable of great things and that is what happened at Rorkes Drift. The legacy of NCO's in the British and American Armies has been the reason for such capability of our units. Russia struggles in Ukraine and one factor is their lack of developing and honoring the roll of NCO's in their ranks. Likely the severity of combat in Ukraine has caused that deficiency to be addressed. It is too early yet, but I can only imagine the acts of bravery that will come from this tragic war.
Good clear precise video,to the point with the information needed to tell a great story,thanks.
The part of the story at the First World War sounds a lot like the Col. Blimp story.
Nigel Green was so memorable in ' Zulu ', his strength and leadership mixed perfectly with his compassion and benevolence - just unforgettable 👏
13" might be the biggest difference between actual height and movie height ever portrayed
The man nearly saw the start of the nuclear war times
What an incredible man! Thank you for putting this magnificent video together,  i really enjoyed watching it💯 Needless to say, 'liked & subbed'
Appreciate hearing about this gentleman. I was a teenager when I first watched the movie in the 80s. It is a great movie showing underdog kind of fight.
As a former Warrant Officer, I was always questioning why Bourne wasn't awarded the VC.
My favorite scene is when Colour Sgt Bourne gives a terrified young trooper a reassuring wink as the enemy prepares to attack.
My initial thoughts was that the care about those who served under him. He knew every detail of their lives intimately and yet engendered respect.   Even in the height of battle in real life he appears to have strengthened them. Just doung his job is astonishing and in many aspects above even what the VC represents.  Thank you for putting context to a much loved character and the story is bigger than I could have imagined.
You do history right. Very entertaining and enthusiastic with a good retelling of the conflict from the perspective of the actual soldiers that fought. Thank you for not reinterpreting it to appease the apologists of today.
"And a bayonet, Sir.. With some guts behind it."🗡
Rising from the ranks to lieutenant colonel in the Victorian Era in the British Army was quite a feat.
I have seen this film and my favorites were the Zulus. Much more athletic as this fat invaders and ready to die by defending THEIR homeland by fighting with inferior weapons.
nice job, thank you. i watch Zulu every time it comes on the tele
My Dad walked into the Living Room while My Brother and I watched this Movie and Said “ My Pappa was in a battle like that . He said they had them stacked like cordwood. “ We asked where and He said Abyssinia. We had no idea where that was but later found out more about it . A Uncle said that “ Pappa barely escaped with His life and made His way to another Italian Camp where everyone had heard they were wiped out. “   My Grandfather was about 6’ 4” and was 18 when He fought there in 1896 . He passed away when I was about 3. We really liked the uniforms of that time. We learned how to shoot using Winchester pump gallery 22’s . We would use them single shot sometimes to mimic the Martini Henry. Now imagine if there were U.S Marine Corps Sergeants there   Pacing back and forth like someone having a Terets spaz attack.
True hero.
How infuriating that that clueless half wit decided to bin that man's interview
Great man, great character🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Excellent comments about The Kid of 5'3" but stood 6'5 a true Tommy 👍🇬🇧
The BBC would happily wipe out all our history. A disgusting bunch of woke 5th columnists!
R I P Colour Sergeant Frank Bourne. You earned it old soldier.
I   heard.  Of  soldier.   Stretcher bearer.  Who got George medal. Being. At front.   Of stretcher.  The one behind got nothing.  !! 😮
In  a battle.  Like that.  I would.  Have  made a  point of.  Standing next  to    Cs.   Bourne.  In his shadow  almost !!!!
Those British guns were powerful and one bullet could go through two or three people
No comedians please!
Great story. What a guy!
“Say sir, officer on parade.”
Quiet....officer on parade
Thank you Sir, another great story.
Beautifully told story, Chris.  I love the fact that "The Kid" was 5 foot 3. His character, of course, was sky-high.  Colour Sergeant Bourne lived and served in a time when duty really was valued. His story is inspiring. Thank you.
Every one of the soldiers at Rourke's Drift were heroes, but none more-so than Borne. It never fails that when the honours are handed out, that the NCO gets passed over. I have the Osprey book covering the battle, and it's brilliant.
Brilliantly told. Time for a remake of the movie, with Tom Cruise as Frank (forgive me if it's already been done)  ;)
Anyone surprised, the BBC thought that the recording of this great man, had know historical significance
Excellent video, and thank you - but where is Frank Bourne buried ?
Stunning landscape around Rorkes Drift and Spieon Kop.
What an absolute hero!
Do your tunic up lad, where do you think you are?
The battle was awful for everyone, I wonder how many VC's should have been handed out to the Zulus,  facing massed volleys of  lead bullets with only Zebra skin shields to defend themselves!  Spare a thought or two for these brave men who after all, were defending their homeland against invaders. That's not to take away from  the efforts of the British Garrison,  but to underline the futility of it all.
I think I will watch the movie again and just imagine him being 5’3” tall standing next to soldiers over 6’ tall. He must have had amazing skills and intelligence to accomplish so much in his life.
For whatever Reason i am taken from the Movie and the Bravery of the Men there. Even the Zulus. They fought against a technical much more powerfull Force wich most of them didnt understand. But they fought... and i have no doubt they know it thus only their sheer Numbers and Bravery would make the Difference. But the 24th was well equipped and in a good defence position. So the Day was in their Favor... But i will not forget their Bravery...
What an extraordinary man. I wish I had learned about him much earlier in my life as I also stand a mere 5' 3" in my socks.
The truth is often much more interesting than the fiction.
It's not the size of the dog in the fight. It's the size of the fight in the dog.
303 Squadron RAF WWII and their war record is something I would like to see.
Excellent story...about an exemplary soldier.
Great stuff
Men were men not woman!!!
"ALRIGHT NO ONE TOLD YOU TO STOP WORKING"!!! Classic
I have always loved the film "Zulu" and of course Colour Sergeant Bourne's portrayal, but the description of his real life given here was far more fascinating! This was a great video.
More colonial stories and how we stopped slavery.
I live 10 min walk from beckenham but now it’s under London since 1965
An excellent video! A film that tops my favorites list. Glad to know about Colour Sergeant Bourne.
Guy Gibson vC
Am i right in thinking Chelmsford wasn't authorised to piss off the Zulus?  He basically started the war on his own.
What about comments from the Zulus? Another dose of condescension.
Yes sir  The gentleman has a bottle
"No comedians, please."
Zulus to the south west sir .thousands of them
Stay where are, Hook!
I can't count the number of times that I've watched Zulu. I was 10 when I first saw it in the theater and as I remember, sat through it several times. You could do that back then. It still gives me a thrill to this day as I approach my 70th trip around the sun. Without a doubt, Colour Sergeant Bourne was/is my favorite character. My favorite quote from him is "Button up that tunic man...where do you think you are?" In my 22 years of service in the Army, I had the honor and privilege of serving with a number of NCOs whose character was just like that of the good Colour Sergeant. Great job Sir!
Great!
what a interesting man he was
"Be quiet, sir. You'll upset the lads, there's a good gentleman." Nigel Green speaking with Jack Hawkins as Colour Sergeant Frank Bourne, senior non-com at the battle of Rorke's Drift. Talk about a gathering of eagles.
I watched Zulu when it came out,.... a great movie,  .. remember,  that's what it was supposed to be, .. it wasn't a documentary! As the years have gone by, I think a true to life,  true to character remake would be better! ( sacrilege?) Than the original!!!!!! Warts 'an all!! The wounded Zulus were dispatched by a beyonet in the head for example!!!! They were not "patched up" as Bourn's son says in a 1930s radio interview!!! Both Officers on that day were too old for their ranks! They had been "passed by"  Why,... because neither had the qualities required for promotion.  Fate took a hand and there they were!
Do up your tunic! There's a good lad.
Gert Adendorff, 1/3rd Native Natal Contingent. 🫡
Wow Lt Colonel AND he got to see the end of ww2 👍
what a bout doing a video of the forgotten (until the Arctic Star medal was created a few years ago) heroes who endured for montrhs on end atrocious weather and the permanent threat of enemy attacks from the air and both on and below the icy waters of the Arctic ocean? My dad spent 2 years as an aircraft mechanic on escort carriers on the arctic convoys,and I think that it's im,possible to imagine the stress ,danger and discomfort these men were in for months on end.The only literature I have read that in any way tells of this is in fact fiction:Alistair Maclain's 'HMS Ulysses'.
My compliments on an extraordinary and insightful assessment of a man who represented the core values Of not only the British army, but England itself.  your eloquence and style is absolutely apropos for this wonderful memorial to the memory of a great man. I feel we will not see their likes again. Thank you for so vividly creating an extraordinary episode in history. It reminds  one that it is in the little places that great things are done, and where ordinary men undergo apotheosis….
Brilliant podcast. Thanks very much
The sentries report zulus to the southwest sir. Thousands of 'em.
Great article. I was lucky enough to pay tribute to Colour Sergeant Bourne at his grave in 2021.
Thank you, very interesting
My Great Grandfather was awarded a distinguished service medal during the Boer War he was the Regimental Sergeant Major of the Kings Hussars at the relief of ladysmith and many othe battles in S.A.  he rescued an officer who had fallen and my Grandfather rode abck and lifted him from certain death. An offiecer di a similar act and he got the V.C. officers got them first.
"Hitch, I saw you, you're alive."
Mr Green Thank you for this download. That man SHOULD have been awarded the V.C. its WRONG that he wasn't. the actor in question i without hesitation with his attitude would follow him into HELL....BRILLIANT ACTING and that man SHOULD have won an Oscar.
Ive returned to this after a year. What a great story.
All right, nobody told you to stop working.
In the film coulor sergeant gets the VC
“Bring your rifles to bear at the ‘illside and fire at the smoke”
"No one said stop working"....
Sorry had to say it , don’t forget mr Caine’s famous words “ will stop throwing those bloody spears “
They weren't heroes, they were mass murderers, plundering everything they could to make the rich richer and more powerful, the VC is just a useless bit of junk impressing impressionable unintelligent, uneducated misfits.
Lovely--so interesting and well presented and I'm so glad to know the story of this remarkable soldier.
Try the relief of ladysmith in the boer war by the royal navy.
The vc, is the highest aaard for valour in uk armed forces. It is not given just for taking part, you must havedsome feat and faced serious danver. Most vcs were postumous. I,e thoes who were awarded it were dead.
No comedians please
Hitch? Hitch? Hitch you're alive I saw you
🦁🎖🌟🍻🇬🇧🫡🙏
Thank you so much for your video really really interesting. About one of my heroes
Came across your video quite by accident.   At the end of his military career Frank Bourne assisted Lord Roberts with The Society of Working Mens Rifle Clubs which ran from 1901 to 1903 and then became The Society of Miniature Rifle Clubs from 1903 to 1947, rebranding itself as the National Smallbore Rifle Association to the current day. I work for the NSRA, Frank Bourne could have been my boss!
Comment? …. ''Spit lad,  spit'' to the bugler …. or was that Chard?
Brilliant
"Gentleman has a bottle, sir..."
Typical of someone at the BBC to think an interview with a survivor from Rorkes Drift "Had no value"
The real Frank Bourne is just as impressive as the one so excellently portrayed in Zulu. Many thanks for unearthing the true story of this wonderful, yet typical British Infantryman who embodies courage and discipline. Looking forward to more of the same.
An amazing summary of an amazing story/soldier
Thanks for this very interesting story. Even a citizen from the Netherlands can enjoy the glorious history of Britain 👍 I will enjoy seeing "Zulu(1964)" again!
My uncle was not very big but as a child he looked enormous to me he was a royal marine who fought in Italy and Germany but  He stood  so upright and proud he looked like he was over six foot.
They were not defenders, they were invaders
"A bayonet is as good as a prayer on a day like this" or something like that. I remember that line as a kid. Not to fully understand those words but solemn meaning came through ok. (Also my father explained it😂)
I read about Hook and his life after, so much looking forward to this vid.
In the interview, he states he was 5 foot 6 inches tall
Chard & Bromfeld were dribbling cowards, the leadership came from Bourne, the entire company lead by the only man close to them who they respected. expected discipline, Bourne dilivered and the movie potrays Bromfeld as a wanker (Michael Caine at his best) and Stanly Baker as Chard, brilliant as an actor and portrayed that so amazingly correct - Look - at the end of the day, Bourne could never receive a Medal - He was the Hero - he did his Job!
Thankgod you don't do videos about axis  heroes,, 😂
Michael Caine worked with Nigel Green again in the ipcress file and Funeral in Berlin .
The class system 😢
In hindsight the Zulus were the real heroes, fighting against modern weapons, to protect their homeland being taken by foreign Invaders which we were.
"Colour Sergeant Bourne, What's that shooting?" "A rifle, Hughes".
I will be honest Zulu was one of my all time films that I could watch time and time again. After being able to go and visit the battle fields of Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift I have never been able to watch it again. Hollywood at its worst
😊its not popular to give medals to ordinary troops unless there dead typical class theme
Nobody told you to stop workin’
Lt Col Bourne OBE. From humble beginnings to the senior officer ranks of the British army. Very rare indeed to reach such heights from the ranks and he must have been a very special soldier to have done so.  One example of the mobility offered within the armed forces of the UK.  What a legend of a man 👍🇬🇧👊
"No comedians, please."
A true giant of a small man. What a life to look back on. Thanks for unearthing all of this. Ex British Army.
I had my daughter watch this movie before she went into the US Army- just to watch Color Sergeant Borne and to understand the role of the NCO, which is very clear in this film.  She’s a Corporal now and should make Sergeant soon.  When we watched the film, I pointed out the officers making the decisions, but the Sergeant making it happen.
'And a bayonet, with some guts behind it." Needs to be the moto of every infantry formation in the world.
Zulu was the first film I ever saw.  The cost was a can of soup out of my mom's cupboard.  Some kind of charity thing.  Bourne was a lovely character, settling the other chaps in the face of certain death.
Rourke's Drift is one of the battle studies we do at US Marine Corp's Basic Officer's Course. A six month course for every new Marine lieutenant at Quantico.
"A prayer is as good as a bayonet on a day like this."
"I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth. The Lord of Hosts is with us."
Great job!
8:17
Zulu's reported to the south-west sir. Thousands of them
“Alllll right…. Nobody told you to stop working…!”
Amazing
Zulu is one of my all time favourite films.  I would like to know about the battle of Cambrai, my Great Grandfather was in the Grenadier Guards and perished there.
During Roll Call following the battle, CSgt Bourne calls the name of Private Hitch.  When there was no answer; Mr Bourne Repeats himself: "HITCH, I HAVE SEEN YOU.  YOU ARE ALIVE"  Pte HITCH Responds "Oh Yes " and giggles.  CSgt Bourne says: "SAY SIR, OFFICER ON PARADE"
Colour Sergeant Bourne was and is the epitome of a high ranking NCO. You know your place in the command structure and stay there because you know you'll do the most good. That's why the British government found the work around and gave him the pension for the VC. They recognizes that without his leadership, there wouldn't have been 11 VC's awarded and the causalities would've been much higher.
All the men at Rorke's Drift should have been awarded the VC, without exception.
"Button up ya tunic".
They wore their medals in battle ?
Splendid work, as ever.
I would like to see a piece on the Battle of New Orleans...I could show my History Students in American History.  Would love to hear your point of view on this battle  Sincerely Richard Capello.
Every one of them should of had a Victoria Cross
‘Fire at the smoke’
Was a lad from Salford there  .I think weaste cemetery
I served 27 years with colours of the 27th, 83rd,87th the Royal Irish Ranger’s , I met and served with many like SNCO’s Bourne and all good men and true, I even got to say on one occasions “mark your target when it comes”! Faugh-A-Ballagh!
R.I.P. Sir. A legend in his own time and after. Respect.
These soilders will never die in memory as to there bravery and sacrifice for king and Country heroes of Rock Drifed 1879
The battle of Rockes Drifted 1879  show the courage of the British soilder who faced overwhelming odds 100 British soldiers and 4000 Zulues yet these British soilder thought with honour and bravery like the Greek war of 1800
Great video. Quite a man, and quite a soldier. How about something about " the Ladies from Hell"- the Scots? MacTaggart
How fitting this legendary British warrior passed the day after VE Day ❤ “that’s it lads there’ll be no more world wars for a while so I’m off” - rest easy Captain 🫡
I can just imagine what the real Bourne would have thought about his image in the movie 😆.
I don’t know if you have done it already? Hook would be great.
❤but you have to give a nod to Surgeon Reynolds..."Damn you Chard, damn all you butchers!! It's funny, for this same actor plays Protestant preacher in the movie Cromwell with Richard Harris.
"Yes sir, the gentleman has a bottle."
Really enjoyed this.   Thanks.   A great soldier
Wow, what a fascinating story…. Love the movie Zulu and his character absolutely dominates every scene he is in. Well done telling his tale
The second time I watched "Zulu" my former husband and I were visiting an office friend who was from Jamaica and her family. We were all stoned out of our minds and it was quite an experience. It's a fantastic movie.
Nobody told you to sto working.
😅Can you please do a film about Peter Butterworths army career
Brilliantly enlightening video.  Many thanks from a Rorke's Drift buff from across the pond.
👏
My favorite Colour Sergeant Frank Bourne quote:: "Those fuzzy-wuzzy's don't like it up ''em!"
I still have my Grandfather's medel from the Zulu  war , and my Fathers  one from the N  W F 1919 along with mine .all from the same Regiment the Somerset Light Infantry
Amazing gentleman of such courage and bravery against such odds may he rest in peace the film was my favourite film of my childhood and still is thank you for sharing this with the world
Fasten your tunic son
My grandmother was left a medal in lieu of board when the lodger ran away to new Zealand It was from 1879 to either Miller or Stonehouse and had a little coin with a hole i think I was a child but I think it had a lion being speared on the ground but have never been able to find anything about it Any ideas please
At 13 mins he said the zulus didnt know how to us their rifles , but how many did they have , the film shows  maybe ten ?
Pass up an officer's rank because he's an eighth son? If anything that sounds like all the more reason to take it.
liked
Thank you for this video. A brilliant piece of history. The truth is often much better than the movie.
Ahhh the sheeple who love the heroic actions of the western imperialist rape, pillage and plunder crew.
All right, nobody told you to stop working
I really enjoy your work and the confidence you have gained through your research. My  wife is related to Lord Roberts  . Now there is a chance for more research . A truly great Hero and leader.
The xx Lancashire fusiliers 6 VCs before breakfast.
And don't forget all the Zulu men who fought with inferior weapons but were also equally brave, if not more so, because they knew what the British soldiers were armed with.
As a point of interest I have two spears picked up by a distant relative and handed down to me in the 1950s had them authenticated by a dealer in USA up for sale if anyone is interested
"Be quiet now.  There's a good gentleman.  You'll upset the lads"
He had an extraordinary life!
GOD save us from mad dogs and Englishmen!!!
“I’m too drunk to taste this chicken, let’s feed it to them” SGT BOURBON
Color Sergent Bourne, Whats that shooting?"  "A rifle Hughs!" I always liked that line, for some reason
SAW THE MOVIE ON 1ST RELEASE ... MESMERIZING TO A YOUNG LAD
Color Sgt Bourne is the size of a Grenadier, which adds to the fierceness.
Alright then Nobody told you to stop working: Colour Sargent Bourne
"Aaaallllrrrriiiggghhttt! No one told you to stop working!"
Colour Sergeant Bourne would have been an extremely tough 5' 3". He wanted to enlist at age 60 which back then was a lot older than 60 is now....Salute, Respect!
"The Gentleman has a bottle"
So the recording of Colour Sergeant Bourne's account was binned was it. That proves that the BBC had its quota of tossers then, as well as now.
Nothing but respect for all of those men, incredible bravery.
OBE=“Officer” of the Order of the British Empire to be distinguished from Member, Commander, Knight, etc.
Given the absolute disaster of Iswandhaia, there weas a vested intersest in seeking to redeem some honour and prestige....perhaps some degree of  Victorian "spin" explains why so many VC's were awarded.....reputations were at stake......just a suggestion.
Why hasn't Britain seized Zulu land ????  For their crimes they need to forfeit their nation now !!! Destroy the ZULU.....
"Because we're here, lad, and nobody else. Just us."
He said himself that at the time he was 5ft 6in, and painfully thin.
There was a radio interview  , but the idiots, wiped it
I am his great great great grandchild my grandmother was the last to carry his name before she married my grandfather. RIP Great x3 grandfather you're family are proud of you to this day
Right nobody told you to stop workin!!
Nothing so galant as a man facing his  death ready to meet his God.The  Old Testament Scriptures.                      ( The Lord is my Shepherd I shall not want )
Maybe it’s just me, but does Frank Bournes story not sound very similar to the story of Bernard Cornwells story of Richard Sharpe but 100 years later?
They were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!
My Great Uncle was a Scottish RSM who fought in both world wars. I never knew him that well but at his funeral in 1986 some of his surviving comrades told me what a good man he was. Maybe not that unlike Bourne, the epitome of the stiff upper lip cool under fire soldier that made Britain great.
What a thoroughly fascinating story... Youve got me hooked.. Ive subscribed.. I love British history... Im learning more about it on YouTube and your channel than I did in school 40 odd years ago..
really interesting, I always wondered why Frank Bourne was not awarded the VC. I would have loved to hear his Voice. Thanks for the Video
Excellent vid thank you HC :-) I was trying to place the background as it looked familiar then as soon as you mentioned it I knew it as went to the Pickled Plum just last week.
Hear hear
My favorite is He'll is coming to Breakfast!  WAIT that's outlaw Josey  Wales never mind.
What a marvellous man. I am so pleased he was recognised and honoured, for his service. I am sure he was an inspiration to his men.
Perhaps had Frank been present at Little Bighorn with Custer things would have turned out better for the Cav.
Calling the roll after the battle "Hitch, Hitch I saw you, you're alive." " Am I? Thank you."
As a junior officer in training, we watched this film. We were then, after, asked by the instructor [s] to write an after action report with appropriate recommendations for action taken under fire.  Everyone thought Bourne had performed admirably and expressed curiosity as to why he was not also recommended for a VC. And, yes, the instructor's response was the same - he was just doing his job.  Given what you have found and covered in this video, I think that if he had accepted the commission offered there would have been no question about him getting the VC. The fact that he WAS awarded the DCM AND an annuity equal to the VC's rather says it all. At that time in the British Army, commissions for officer rank were bought, and not generally earned. That he was offered one is indicative of the regard in which he was held. A commission as a lieutant would have normally cost £700 pounds sterling. If he was being asked to purchase it, then you can readily see why he declined.
"Mr Witt, be quiet now, will you? There's a good gentleman. You'll upset the lads" has to be one of my favourites... there are so many , though, not just from Bourne but the rest of the cast also.  Some inspired script writing went into this film!
"nobody told you to stop working."
"Come along now be a good gentleman" to Jack Hawkins who was cracking up...
Real heroes like Color Sgt Bourne, tend to be humble and give credit to others. Like Sgt York and Lt. Audie Murphy, heroes don't seek the lime light, it seeks them. The best scene in the movie that shows his true character is when he is with the soldiers hiding behind the wall at the redoubt, and the soldier next to him is scared and without a word he touches his shoulder to steady and reassure him. This is the kind of small thing that makes a big difference to the common soldiers. While officers are important, a professional NCO corps is the backbone of a good military. Look at the trouble the Russians are having in Ukraine, their NCO corps is nothing but a group of thugs (same as their officers). The regular soldiers wouldn't follow them to the bathroom and don't want to die for them in battle.
he was a real gentleman
this is my boyfriends great grandad❤
Very interesting.
The man was clearly an exemplary soldier of the highest order and an inspiration to all the men who served under him. He may have only been five feet and change tall, but was no less a towering figure. On the backs of such men an empire was built. I would have loved to have seen his face had he been able to watch his portrayal on film.
Yes sir the gentleman has a bottle
Medals for imperialistic killers
Love pershore
They don’t make em The same nowadays
Sadly these were given out like confetti to cover the disaster of the day before and to protect the overall commander who was a personal friend of Victoria. Veteran
He is the last one who died in 1945 out of all the survivor of rorke's drift..
I just finished watching the movie a couple of days ago. This was an excellent video, and now I want to watch the movie again!  I also want to read the transcript of his interview.  Thank you for renewing my long standing love of 19th century history, now on both sides of the pond.
Wow… what a life…
great series...
Love this movie
You've got this thing about the use of the word Anglo, it's only England that has Angle heritage, England isn't Britain
wow love this i just had to subscribe
I hope the ancestors save me some when I get there.
ps Sorry, another thought, Zulu is watched by my family every Christmas day after the late Queens Speech.
My dear new friend, you are the embodiment of the lovely C>S> Bourne, I saw the movie and would love to have met Frank. Maybe we will meet sometime, regards Sarah Janet Winter.
What a man he was,small in stature but massive  in courage.
Total respect. I think you should have emigrated, led an insurrection, or merely drawn your curtains across, had you lived now.
Were you at RMAS, Mr Green?
brilliant thank you so good
They don't like it up em
"Now don't upset the lads"
"Easy lads"
Can only imagine the incredible amount of discipline that those British had, even in the face of such an overwhelming situation.
Brilliant!
They faced a small renegade offshoot of the Zulu Army - the medals were a sop to hide the Islandwana disaster
Very informative video  Thank you The movie Zulu in my humble opinion  one of the best war movies ever
Fantastic story
Zulu is among the BEST epic historical dramas ever filmed!
All right, nobody told you to stop working.
Thanks from the USA!
Have you ever heard of the mutiny at Salerno?
1879 3 years before this custer lost his battle at little big horn in 1876 .
I don't mean to be disrespectful in any way to colour seargent Bourne but I can't help comparing his image to seargent who yelled and screamed at those enlisted characters  in the show  "It' Aint Half Hot Mum".
He looks white to me….
Is there any information on the battle of Kohima and what where the dates it took place  and the casualty  rate of the British  and what regiments where in action  and if possible  names of the  fallen
I would like it if you could do something on Popov's Private Army in North Africa in WWII
Besides the " just us" line.  " They knows my voice when they hear it."
Courage of the defenders? I'd have thought the attackers had more courage! Imagine running past corpses while guns blast away at you.
‘Do that tunic button up boy’. Classic line. It’s all about absolute discipline.
Who was the moron that binned the interview recording?
"All right Mr Witt sir, be a good gentleman then sir."
That was another great video. Here we all were thinking that colour sergeant Bourne was a 6ft giant, when he was only 5 foot 3  Still it was a great movie
What a complete badass.
Great story well done 👏
Yes, I enjoyed this very much.  Thank you for sharing.
Another excellent history. Thank You. I'd like to choke the BBC guy who destroyed that interview. (only to the point of unconsciousness)
I would add the courage of both sides of this horrific battle.
Cannot imagine a better actor to play Colour Sergeant Bourne than Nigel Green.
"All right, nobody told you to stop working." Nigel Green was one of those great actors everyone recognizes, though they may not know the name.
As a former soldier, I'm shocked at the amount of people in the comments who got to watch films during their training
“Say sir, officer on parade” “Hitch, I saw you, you’re alive!”
No Colour Sargent is 5ft 3in.  They are all 12 ft tall and breath fire.
WOW!  WELL DONE, SIR.
Lets just reflect on that; He participated in a legendary battle, got to serve in both africa and india, got to experience living through BOTH world wars, AND tried to sign up for the first world war at freaking 60!  This man got to see the british empire go from fighting spears in africa, all the way to experience London being bombed, something unthinkable at the time of Rorkes drift. - HOLY GEEBERS WHAT A LIFE!
British is always Best
*A fascinating story. As for "Zulu", one of my very favorite movies.*
"AAAALLLLLLLLRIGHT THEN...... Nobody told you to stop WORKIN' " I actually used this quote when a NCO in the US Army many years ago. It worked perfectly! 😊
Color Sergeant Bond was one of my favorites. I liked Chard and Bromhead and of courrse Surgeon Reynolds fixing the men up.
He was a rich brat, whose family bought a commission from the Crown.  He never suffered the rigors of a soldier.  He never dug a trench.  He had servants while on the battle field.
Yes watched it many times he was a hero and wanted to know why he was overlooked
What a great empire!
“Hitch I saw you.   You’re alive.”
He would have been so proud of his great-grandson, Jason.
What a legend.
So in the British Army a Color (or Colour as they spell it) is a Platoon Sgt.?
I'd love to hear the interview of Bourne.
As to units to look up LRDG and the SAS in the North African campaign.
Here is a second very thick very dry read with almost overwhelming detail. The Zulu War Paperback – June 30, 2005 by Saul David  (Author) Hard copy originals are going for hundreds of dollars. It fills in some materials missing from the "Washing of the Spears".
Zulu is one my favourite films. It’s a shame the Zulus didn’t fair better in the film. Colonialism is evil now and then
Thank you for telling us about Frank Bourne … what an example to us all.
What of the Fates of the two officers at RD?  Did the UK treat them of equal Valor through their careers?
(During roll call ) Hitch your alive … I saw you ….
Randomly found this video and put it on,  only to see my hometown abbey in the background lol
I always thought he was Colour Sergeant Vaughn, good to know!
I love all your videos.  This particular one is something I've  always wondered about. Thank you for all your effort in uploading all this amazing history 👏
I was in the Brit army in the 80's and many of our Warrant Officers were just like the F. Bourne portrayed in the film, moustache and all; incredible men. Zulu is one of my all time fav films, sadly it's probably deemed as racist these days or they'd have to remake it and put black actors in the main roles like Colour Sergeant Bourne before they could show such a film.
"I was sleeping, sir..."
Visiting England presently and stopped in for a spot of rousing history after listening to a rendition of "Scotland the Brave." Well done! I am not a military man personally but am a historian myself; I am also 5'4" and appreciate this man all the more now (and I am not from England, BTW, but a "Yank"). Many thanks. PS: No particular quote is my favorite, as all of Nigel Green's lines were brilliant, as were all the lines in that film. Love that show, and have, since I first watched it at age 12 or thereabouts (55 now). I am also very glad to know that Bourne saw VE Day! Good show.
Very well done. Thanks!
“Why us?” “Because we’re ere lad”.
Chills at 12:15. Loved the film, the history, and the success of a solid leader of men.
Great interesting and informative video!  Colour Sergeant Frank Bourne was perhaps my favorite character in the movie version of the battle of Rorke's Drift, and it was surprising to me that he did not receive the VC.  It was good to learn that not only was he offered the choice of a VC or a commission, but that eventually he rose as high as he did.  in the US Navy, the signal flag hoist for "Well Done" is Bravo Zulu, and that seems somehow appropriate for the gallant Colour Sergeant known as The Kid.
Once again, like most defeats bad strategy
Well, the Zulus were pushed down from the other tribes, and that’s where the Dutch actually found in South Africa
It actually doesn’t surprise me that the BBC binned the interview because they thought it had “no historical value”.
"No one told you to stop working..."
How about, when it fits your schedule, doing something on the Luddites.
I loved the part when Colour Sergeant Bourne was walking past the soldiers awaiting the Zulu attack, he paused to tell a soldier to do up a button on his tunic! classic British Army!!!
An excellent video which has drawn me to your other material. Films like Rorke’s Drift had a huge impact on me as a child, reading “Washing of the Spears” drew me further into the topic. My favourite quote: “A prayer’s as good as a bayonet on a day like this”
Alright!! Nobody told ya stop workin!
And I’d love to see you do a video on 2 Para on Operation Market Garden , defending the bridge too far 🙏🏻😍
My 2 favourite RSM’s is Greenes and strangely Michael Palins RSM from Monty Pythons Meaning of Life 😂😂😂
I watched Zulu a few times. But i always thought it was Nigel Davenport not Nigel green, So you live and learn, Good video 👍
A yank here, we admire men with "pluck", but this was more. We call it "grit", and this man had it in spades.
Hello . My dad was involved in the Salerno Landings WWII can you make a video about that . I have a photo of my dad running down a gang plank from a troop lander if you would like to feature it .
A life of service.
One of the Best videos on utub love this film
What a fascinating life! A soldier's soldier!
Brilliant actor. Heavy influence for me wanting to enlist.
As a note, i did hear many years ago that the best snipers in the British army in WW1 were Irish. I can't find any results with a Google search though.
So this makes the second of two well-known British officers from the 1800s who were played by actors that were a foot taller than they were. The other one would be Charlton Heston in the Khartoum movie.
Tony Atkins?  The soldier from Hidden & Dangerous?  I was honestly surprised to see you talking in person because most people who make many documentaries like this rarely show their faces. You don't look as young as your voice made you sound. 😁  I don't mean that to be an insult but as a compliment.
When he was offered a Commission bc of his extensive experience he should have been at least a Major not a Lieutenant. A soldier I know was a Sgt after ten years experience (he had a degree) was then offered a commission he ended up a Colonel.
I would not disparage the courage of men of Rorkes Drift. Indeed I would not dare as my late father-in-law served in the South Wales Borderers through WW2. Actually he was a Territorial in camp in 1939 when war was declared and left a Sgt. in 1946. However it is on record (somewhere) that Field Marshall Lord Frederick Roberts at the time was indignant at the amount of medals awarded for this battle and said "'this is not courage, which is from choice when you have an alternative, whereas even a cornered rat will fight for its life" or words to that effect.
Thanks for a very interesting video. I've been lucky enough to go to Rorke's Drift when I lived in Natal.
Loving your vids, just discovered them, 👍
I'll give you seven words and a big thank you.
The eu/un must be destroyed for all western countries to keep our European cultural, heritage, identities and for our children to have a safe peaceful, degenerate dictatorship free future.
" All right, no-one said to quit working."
I want you to re-inact that BBC interview that got "binned"
Thank you sir. Excellent video
That £10 pension was like £1500 a month today  😳
Thanks so much love history
Loved the movie as a kid and I am really enjoying learning the history of the battle an those that fought it! Great work !
This movie followed me through my Australian Army Military career. First in the 70’s with Army Cadets, then the 80’s at Bardia Barracks as a Reservist recruit and again on my Cpl and Sgt’s courses. The last time was when I transferred to Regular service with 1 Bde HQ. I last ran it was in the 90’s when I was running team building courses for ICI shift teams. I think it’s time again! This and the Dad’s Army series you have done have me hooked. Cheers Mate.🇳🇿
"Frank Bourne, the last surviving defender of Rorke's Drift died in 1945, one day after the Germans surrendered" - the sweep of history in that one life, spectacular - and horrific, with history defined by conflict.
Excellent video on the career of this most distinguished soldier!
Mister Witt Sir! be quiet now, will you? There's a good gentleman. You'll upset the lads
Favorite Quote Bourne: "Advance!" Brumhead: "Follow Me" Chard: "Form a flying platoon with Sgt. Winridge... Get yourself a platoon of bayonet Men. Take them head on at anything that breaks through our lines."
Fantastic production, thanks so much!
Fascinating story.
I am not a jingoistic "patriot" at all, and I couldn't care less for the Empire. But I found this very moving.  The man was a bloody hero, that's all there is to it.  {:o:O:}
What a man.  I would like to hear about James Finn,  a Salvationist who died in the great war please
Enjoyable.  Thanks for this.  Of course, I have long since learnt never get your history from movies!  But nice to see they paid him a great tribute.
A bayonet with some guts behind it has to be classic.
All right then nobody told you to stop working
Healing the climate lies of the past  Al Gore was not the first. Frank Baxter of The Bell System Science Series E.g.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHVTQ2fLM0 was first. This alarmist video was plagiarized by Al Gore.  The claim that CO2 was a "heat trapping gas" was scuttlebutt at that time. Alarmists presented no knowledge of the X10 CO2 level during the late Ordovician while a global glaciation prevailed, as revealed by drop stones in Sahara and Saudi Arabia. CO2 is NOT a "heat trapping gas". This claim comes from the 'authority' of Al Gore, psychopath, businessman. Al Gore took only one science course from Oceanographer Roger Revelle. They argued. Journalism records this snippet of history. Regrettably journalist historians did not report what grade student Al Gore was awarded, while a student at Harvard?  As a psychopath businessman Al Gore became excited with the business opportunities provided by Carl Sagan’s “Greenhouse”. Sagan’s “Greenhouse” was repudiated by Carl Sagan himself and his colleague Bishun Khare when they did chemical analysis of ‘Tholin’, using Infrared Spectroscopy and other techniques. Infrared Spectroscopy deals with Infrared radiation emitted and absorbed. For understanding IR radiation, there are the Beer-Lambert Laws. The absorption depth of IR radiation in air is measured at 1.0 cm. The highway mirage, Forrest M. Mims III  https://web.archive.org/web/20060218195616/http://www.sas.org/tcs/weeklyIssues/2004-09-10/gallery/index.html   ‘Black asphalt highways form a perfect substrate for the production of mirages. As the sun illuminates the pavement, its temperature rises significantly. The hot asphalt then warms a thin layer of air over the pavement. Warm air has a lower index of refraction than cool air.’  Al Gore has revealed himself to be an uneducated psychopathic moron. Who would believe what he says? Enough did believe him, that he earned $300 million$ which he invested in Southern California real estate. It appears he can no longer pay the property taxes.  Let’s analyze according to the Ideal Gas Law:  PV=nRT  Where: P=pressure V=Volume n=number of Moles R=Ideal Gas Constant = In terms of SI base units: R = 8.314462618... kg⋅m2⋅s−2⋅K−1⋅mol−1.  The Ideal Gas Law says that hot air rises, moist hot air rises faster (water vapor is less dense than air and so experiences a greater buoyancy force.)  Consider Al Gore’s brain diseased ‘heat trapping gas’. It needs a negative buoyancy force. It is inconsistent with the Ideal Gas Law. The claim that carbon dioxide is a ‘heat trapping gas’ is inconsistent with fact of the later Ordovician Era when CO2 was X10 present levels during a worldwide glaciation, shown by drop stones in Sahara and Saudi Arabia.
What a great story.  Quite a man and inspiration.   Thanks so much for sharing.
I remember talking to a neighbour when I was small and grandad lived with us and he was there, and my neighbour said he had been in the war. The only war I had heard of then was the Boer War and I asked if that was the war he had fought in, it wasn’t it was Korea
Rev Otto Witt - "Say it man., lift your voice to God let him hear it" Bourne - "He'll know my voice when he hears it"
The BBC really were the worst curators for their own archive.
First time? Told you I came to build a bridge.  Haunts me and says so much about leadership in a crisis.
The military life of actor Claude Rains seems to be that during the first World War he went in as a private seeing a lot of action, eventually becoming a captain?. And surprisingly information regarding the military service of another actor Trevor Howard seems to be rather sparse if not totally absent.
"mark your targets when it comes"
Mr Bourne was half the size of his movie character
"Say 'Sir", officer on parade"!
"The kid"
Colour sargentl bourne great lInes because were err lad. A 457
Wow..brilliant..
"Say sir, officer on parade!"
I didn't even know I wanted to learn this today! 🤪 What a great video! Simple, interesting, told with zeal! Thank you 🤩
Not only was the real man only 5'3" compared to 6'4" tall; he was also 25 years old and portrayed by a 40 year old actor.
Well Done - in telling the story of the colour sergeant! And Well Done to colour sergeant Bourne - for showing the standard for Colour Sergeants in battle. I will never forget my cousin twice removed Lieutenant General Albert Sheppard telling me as a Cadet how Sergeants are the backbone of any army! These are the underappreciated REAL Heroes!! God bless them everyone!
"Hitch!..........................Hitch I saw you, you're alive..........."  As the Sergeant slightly rolls his eyes LOL  Officer on parade indeed.
Typical of the arrogant British wanting to conquer the world.  Brutal murderers
What a true hero.As a little footnote…I was working as an air hostess in the early 70’s and just a few weeks before his tragically early death ,had Nigel Green as a passenger ,he was so right for the part.
Not just a fierce warrior, but a good man. He should have been awarded the VC.
Thank you Sir, a wonderful report, beautifully presented.
Wot a Great soldier and a great career.
"Quiet now.... that's a good gentleman ...... you'll upset the lads" ..... AND .... (excused duty's sir)..."no comedians please.......officer on parade........"  That's just off the top of my head haven't watch the film in about 7 years I guess. Also agree with you that he was the best part of the film. The rest was also very good but you really followed the film though him.
Spit boy spit when the bugler couldn’t play because his mouth was dry
I wish I was related to a man like this....what an inspiration.
SIMPLY BRILLIANT
Well done sir, your tribute to Colour Sergeant Frank Bourne (later Lt. Col.) was an outstanding presentation. Thank you for the straight forward and honest history of the times, events and man!
So glad to know that you idolized that movie  exactly the same as I did. I was born in 1960 and saw it as a youngster. It has been top of my list ever since. Watched it avidly when shown on tv. Now own on DVD along with Zulu dawn. I too compared actual account to movies via computer. Your videos are awesome. Thank you so much. My favorite quote from the Sgt was. " all right then, no one told you to stop working."  How could anyone maintain such discipline at a time like that? Movie or not. I believe that that level  of discipline  and courage did exist at that battle. How else can you explain it?
Thanks for the video. I have been interested in the Anglo-Zulu war since I first saw this movie back in the 60s. One thing I would like ask you and the others out in the audience is: what was the equivalency rate of 10 pounds a year to that in US Currency? Being an American I not sure how much the rate of exchange was in 1879.
“Steady Men, Steady.”
So Glad To Find You ...   I Cannot STAND The Many Self Hating British - I Have Much Respect Her And Her Glorious Past !
This definitely proves the old adage that it's not the size of the dog in the fight, but the size of the fight in the dog that counts. I'm 5'3", so this particularly hits home. I loved the character of Color Sergeant Bourne in the movie; it turns out the truth is even better. RIP Lt. Col Bourne.
5'3!?! I'm taller then he was!
There's a good lad
There should be a Frank Bourne Day to commemorate such bravery and should be a national example to all our youngsters of what can be accomplished from humble beginnings. Thank you for a brilliant video. Five foot three inches eh? Who would have thought it?
He’s buried at Beckenham cemetery.. visited a couple of times when I lived there.
"Hitch!.... Hitch, you're alive, I saw you"
Colour Sergeant Bourne: A prayer's as good as bayonet on a day like this
Greatly appreciated.
Absolutely fantastic movie.
Thank you for this video and facts. Much appreciated.
"Look to your front" mark your targets as they come"...Hitch do your tunic up". "My tunic??" "Do it up!" "Who do your think you are man". 😃😃
What about Sgt Joseph Windridge, my cousin. ??
"You're alive.... I've see you !!"
Physically he may have been 5'3", but in guts he was 9 feet tall.
Superb information !!
Because we’re here Lad! Nobody else just us!
what a fantastic film  i enjoyed the Zulu singing ,subtitle would have been good , don't know how many times i have seen it, Nigel Green`s along with Sanely Baxter, Michael Caine, Jack Hawkins,
Amazing! So in essence, the epitome of a career Non-Com who became a Mustang and rose through the ranks. We used to see quite a few Mustangs in the USMC, most being superb Marines and never forgetting their time in the ranks. And the Senior Non-Coms, the Master Gunnery Sgts and Sgt's Major, were always superb Marines. I wonder if there's a common thread of some sort running among these men that could be identified.
You know that you’re a badass when you keep being promoted. I served in Iraq. Colour  Sergeant Bourne is one of my profound heroes.
Oh, man...when you said his interview was binned, I groaned aloud.
Argh! To have binned an interview like that... typical BBC;  I would have dearly relished the opportunity to hear Frank Bourne in his own voice.
Hitch! You slobbering solder.
Great story, reality is always more interesting than fiction.
Be quiet now, you'll upset the lads, there's a good gentleman.
Dude you rock.
They say that to have a perfect army, you need americans for logistics, german officers, british ncoss, and gurkha as infantrymen...
Thank you so much for this,  brilliantly done, marvellous soldier
Is there a transcript of his rado interview anywhere?
He was my favorite character! And this line speaks volumes when he disciplines the preacher who tries to turn the guard against his fellow soldiers!: "Mr. Witt Sir. Be quiet now, will you. There's a good gentleman. You'll upset the lads." While at the time he was probably thinking, "You bloody bastard, shut your mouth, or I'll shut it for you." Of course, being a proper soldier, he couldn't say that. LOL!
He refused to leave until his beloved British Empire was again safe.
Do your tunic up lad, where do you think you are?
"he breaketh the bow and snappeth the spear in sunder" and "I shall be exalted among the heathen. I shall be exalted among the earth. For the Lord of Hosts is with us". Most badass Bible reading *ever*
That's right sir. A prayer's as good as a bayonet on a day like this
Nice video mate, i really enjoyed it! Thanks very much!
"get sweating"
"No comedians please, officer on parade ".
"Call me sir" Officer On Parade..…...
At 14 I saw it in 64 when it hit the big screen, still my all time favorite movie. Got the 50th anniversary edition DVD. Thanks for sharing this story.
It's a shame that that recording was destroyed. Well at least the transcript still exists.
Great film. Great dialogue. Great characters based the upon great character of those who were, "...in the arena.." & rose to the occasion.
Salute!
A truly excellent and enthusiastic presentation. Yes, the film Zulu did appear to over glamourise the roles of the two officers Lt John Rouse Merriot Chard, Royal Engineers and Lt Gonville Bromhead, 2nd / 24th Regiment of Foot, but as always it was most likely the steely backed N.C.O's like C/Sgt. Bourne that carried the day.
"Jesus Christ....it's Frank Bourne's grandson....Jason Bourne."
"That's a nice gentleman."
So where is his grave location, was surprised you didn't show it
Thank you Chris interesting facts one thing in my History studies always made me smile is the fact that the British fought in their famous red uniforms despite the surrounding countryside or forest etc one of the issues that pleased the guerrillas in the USA War for Independence
what a great video, thank you
Hi Chris green .. Chris green here love the chanel 👍
'Be quiet there's a good gentleman'..'Zulus to the Southwest....thousands of 'em'
He was no doubt an NCO worth more than given credit for!  Maybe he showed his ass to much to someone e shouldnt
Many thanks. 👏
STAND FAST LADS!!!
Private Thomas Burke features in the film, but his grave at Ford Catholic Cemetery, Litherland, north Liverpool, does not mention his service as a defender of Rorke's Drift, in B Company, 2nd Battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot. For this he was recipient of the South Africa Medal, with 1877-8-9...buried in my local cemetary
Not just a great film, or a great war film, but "Zulu" is one of the great films of all time.
Absolutely brilliant, mate. I MUST say that your youtube channel quite supplants the likes of the History channel as well as all of the others. Your channel is like military history à la carte! Cannot wait for your next release!
In one of your videos, you mentioned a personality whose personal history you described as a real life boys adventure. I can’t find that video on your list anywhere, am I hallucinating or do you remember that video? As always thank you for these videos. Each one of them is really fascinating and worth every minute.
How extraordinary that he lived to the end of WWII.  Early in the war, as a morale booster, the British published a series of pamphlets under the general heading "Great Exploits".  I still have the one titled "The Day of Rourke's Drift".  I read it many years before the movie was made, so I was eager to see how the event would be portrayed.  Except that there was more fighting at night than the movie suggested, I found it reasonably accurate.   It is amazing that Bourne lived to see the story published so many years later and at a time Britain needed to know the story.  I'll have to read it again to see whether there are references to him.
What a brilliant video mate. Thank you..
I all ways thought it was absurd he didn't get one
Wonderful video.  My step father was a fan of miniature soldiers.  He spent hours painting them.  One of his collections was of this battle.  He also had two lithographs art pieces depicting this battle.  We watch the two movies, Zulu and Zulu Dawn multiple times together.  He was a career soldier in the US Army (serving in post war Europe in the mid fifties, after serving in Korea, and in the 60's, in Viet Nam) and an amateur historian.  The British Empire always held a fascination for him, especially the First World War.  He had memorized many of Rudyard Kiplings most famous poems, including Gunga Din, The Road to Mandalay, and Tommy.  Thanks for the memories...I lost my dad in 2018.
Hi ! Is there any / enough material to do a full episode on Zulu accounts of Rorke's Drift / Isandlwana, from their own perspective ? That would be an interesting episode ... : )
Great story!!!
Cornwallis from Jutland died in Grimsby General Hospital after the battle
I don’t remember exactly what it was, but it was what he said to the priest after the priest tried to influence the Private guarding him
My dad who was born in Cardiff Wales loved the move Zulu. He was in the British Navy during WWII and had great respect for the Army. He would say wars are won based on the determination of the Sergeants and Privates.
That was a terrific biography of a terrific and dedicated soldier.
" ALLLLLL-RIIIIIGHT THEN ! No body told you to stop working ! "
Being a fan of the movie and an amateur military historian I have often wondered what had become of Colour Sergeant Frank Bourne. Thank you for the information. It was entertaining and informative.
Hi great video that’s why the saying the sun never sets on the British Empire was a common phrase in the late 19th century because of soldiers like Colour Sargent Bourne, and the line from the film is (Who told you to stop get sweating) 👍
button that tunic.
Wow
Great research, great video, thank you.
The BBC binned the interview!!! Would love to have heard his voice. Favourite part in zulu is Bourne 1on 1 and the volley fire scene with Bourne shouting ADVANCE
Hi    How about James Graham  Earl of Montrose.  In my opinion the best strategic general these islands have produced.  In the civil war he beat all the Kings armies sent against him.  When the Scots reversed their position Graham changed sides and beat all the Parliamentary forces sent against him.  A man of high honour who cared for his soldiers, but was betrayed to his death by Charles II.
That’s a life lived to the full wow what a man
Colour-Sergeant Bourne is the continuation of a line of noncommissioned officer going back to Caesar's legions.
Thank you very much for this.  I love informative and researched truth.  What a brave and honourable man he was. Fascinating that he lived -just - to see  VE Day.
What moron got rid of Lt Colonel Frank Bourne OBE DCM interview at the BBC! Would have been amazing to hear his voice.
As a recruit at Kapooka we had to watch "ZULU" as it shows what discipline does then later as a recruit instructor myself I watched it with every recruit course we did. 13 of them!
Hooah!  Outstanding biography of a genuine soldier hero!
After reading Ashcrofts Victoria cross hero’s wanted to hear more about the brave men tho bourne didn’t receive the vc   people like you and the film we will always relate to all the soldiers .all brave men
Oustanding video/documentary. Thank you!
All the 4s 🇬🇧🇬🇧👍
I too am a Retired U.S Army Officer and greatly appreciate your Historical film.  I have studied the Zulu Campaign over the  years, and by accident discovered the Canadian War Museum in Nanaimo Canada, with Zulu Campaigned mannequins on display.
I wonder if he was looked on as a legendary figure in the latter years of his career? The Victorian British Army had so many notable encounters and battles did Rorkes Drift get lost in the shuffle?
Excellent presentation and information. Thank You.
" The gentleman has a bottle^"
Nigel green was a great actor
The bravery of such men stirs me deeply, well done, lad 🤗
@thehistorychap There is a monument near my home in Birmingham dedicated to the brave soldiers at Roukes Drift, can you shed any light on this as I gathered they were Welsh from the movie
"All right, no-one told you to stop working"
Thank you. It is so informative. As a Cpt in 42 RM  it is justice for our fallen. May they RIP as the Last Post sounds. In god we trust
Brilliant video sir
Very good :) Thank you :)
Many Heroes are short men. size has no impact on courage. My father was born in Koenigsberg, East Prussia,  He fought at Stalingrad, he was wounded and was shipped out. he was awarded the Iron Cross for his efforts, ( still have the Medal) He was wounded six times.  He was eventually captured by the  Yanks in Italy.  He was sent to America, where they were put to work clearing the ground which is now known as Cape Canaveral. He was then sent to the UK to be repatriated, however he met my Mother and he stayed.  She made his life a misery, and me being the Eldest was treated in the same manner.
Now what happened to the "cowardly" cavalry?  I don't know if they really cowardly ran away or if they were ordered to go get help or something.
The empire "courageously" fighting against what you would deem "natives" or others would deem "defenders of their homeland"- perspective is a wonderful thing
Keep out out of other people's lands!
I love this. Finally.. the common soldier deserves some recognition. Greetings from Greece.
Thanks so much for this video, I learned a lot about the average British soldier and way above average human being.
CSM Bourne, "All right, nobody told you to stop working! You lead back-sided--------- get sweatin'!".
He didn't get the VC because he was doing his job. As a color sergeant he was rightly expected to do his job and he did it well, but you don't get a VC for that. I have always believed that to be the reason he didn't get the VC and now it's confirmed. But heroic, stoic, larger than life, movie-color-sergeant Bourne will live on for as long as anyone watches the movie Zulu. And that's not a bad legacy for any man.
Colour Sergeant, is a very respected, and senior rank in the British Army. They don't give out the colours, easily. You have to be the epitome of a British Soldier. Just like the RSM. It is a rank that is not easily achieved. Looking at the action in Roukes. You can see why men of the Colours, are chosen to hold that rank.
Stand up straight! Look to your front, and mark your target when he comes.
What a man!
Cause there ain't no one else lad!
Zulu's Sir. Thousands of them
Fascinating.
Thank you, yes, he may have not been as tall as I thought. Yet I wish I could of been around to talk to him
I wonder what happened to his sons and daughters?
Zulu is one of my all time favorite war movies. I wonder if you could do a video on Majuba Hill in the First Boer War?
He should have received the Cross just for helping Read and Write for his Troops.
Favorite call of Bourne?  Easy:  “Stand…….TO!”
i should never watch these vids  they ruin the movies i love because all i can see is the errors! was a great video and eye opening too! thanks for posting!
Happened upon ZULU in the days of regular TV.  Had never heard of it.  No wiki, or anything  back then(1980s).  Was stunned by it. NGs portrayal was top shelf.
It seems fitting that he lived just long enough to know that the Allies, with Great Britain, won WWII. What a brave man. Bravo Zulu. (pun intended).
A amazing story and a amazing job by Nigel Green. Incredible movie. I saw it when it first came out. Some many amazing scenes. This movie is timeless.
Queen Victoria awarded 11 to keep the morale up in the British army
Great story, well told. Thank you. I enjoyed this very much and learned about a great man. What a life.
All the horror films made, this film scared me. When the zulus appeared on the hill. Also the sound of the shields when they banged them. It was so scary. I liked when the private asked after he'd been shot, can I open my buttons now sir. The tears fell when they started singing and the zulus honoured brave warriors. Its a corking film.!!! Its real!!!!!!
"Steady, steady..."
A English Hero, I drive past his house in beckenham all the time. It has a purple plaque on the wall to commemorate his life and service and rightly so…..
Excellent video.  A real shame that BBC recording did not survive.
“Keep your voices down….officer on parade”
Thanks for providing a cap to this story.  In the US army, the Sergeants run the show also
Very good informations .
My father took his wife and all us kids to see Zulu when it came out here in the States. He was a Marine and we saw the film many times and knew most of the words! My favorite Colour Sergeant Bourne moment was him reciting Psalm 46:10, I shall be exalted  among the heathen; I shall be exalted among the earth. The Lord of Hosts is with us". Hope I got that right. When my dad died the Anglican priest read that psalm. When we took dad to bury him in San Antonio, Zulu was playing downtown. We thought that was a sign for dad. Cheers to C.S Bourne.
Thanks for this great presentation on CSGT Bourne. First seen by me in a high school english class, while I was also in the school's cadet unit. He is the epitome of the Senior NCO I later encountered in my Australian Army Reserve service, and the type of SNCO I wanted to be when I attained the rank of Sergeant. The calm, succinct voice of authority. In later times I served as a volunteer fire service officer for 30 years, where this calm succinct voice of authority I believe was key in leading firefighters and assisting worried fire victims. I'm not sure I reached Bourne's standards and of course I didn't have to bayonet a bush fire! On 19th December 2019 I and my crew faced near death during a severe bush fire overrun. The calm succinct voice of authority and firefighters who never once flinched servived the day.
Thank you for a very well presented piece of history of colour sergeant Frank Bourne. I myself have been 14 years in the mitary and love history.
What very brave and courageous men, gone but not forgotten. Thank you to all of our forces for defending our country and for your unstinting service.❤
Zulus, Sir, thousands of them"
very good video, it is surprising that him seeing so much action in his life lived to be 91 years old, hurrah for the man!
This is the transcript read out in this video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l59BTOG_iY&ab_channel=HistoricBattlefields
One phrase could some up his military service, “Now that’s soldiering!l”.
no comedians please
I wonder if there are any statues of him?
“It’s sir, I’m officer on parade
All right then......nobody asked yu to quit workin!!!
thank you
Yup then the pommies faces us the boere and we were damn good shooter
Would love to hear more of Private 593 William Jones who was awarded the VC after the Rorkes Drift action, it seems he had a most interesting life after his army service.
It would appear that the B B C were a bunch of left wing lunatics even back then
excellent history History lesson....Semper Fi Colour Sergeant Bourne
“Say Sir,” “ officer on parade.” Thanks….
Hitch!  You’re alive.  I’ve seen you! Am I sergeant?  Thank you very much
The real hero of Rourkes Drift was the retiring Dalton who gets hardly a mention other than by the people who were there. The building of a redoubt and splitting the camp was entirely his idea as both Chard and Bromhead acknowledged bowing to his experience.
"Look to your front  Mark your target when he comes" Yes sir !
29 years service, enlisted for 19 years and an officer for 10. Colour Sergeant Bourne is the epitome of the professional Soldier and NCO. Thank you for the video; his like should never be forgotten.
The BBC  got rid of his interview , what a load of scumbags .
“Because we’re here laaad, nobody elwsh”
"Even numbers, Sir ?"
Hook, your alive hook, I'seen you.
He actually did better than the other VC winners.
I’ve been to Rorkes Drift and it was Awesome to actually stand  where it actually happened. Unfortunately not as picturesque as the movie but still cool
Bravo
Thanks for that, Chris, very interesting presentation. As a short bloke (5'6"), I can well imagine how C/Sgt Bourne must have felt, even in an age when soldiers were smaller on average. Could we hear more about the Xhosa Wars that you mention in the video? All the best, Chris.
I always wondered why they didn't just slit the bags. Strange.
Without doubt my favourite presentation of the dozens you’ve made, Chris
This is the second of your programs I've watched and I'm thoroughly enthralled you seem awfully happy or jovial for an Englishman I don't mean that in a negative way my brother in law is English and he's kind of a happy fela too. anyways you should have more than enough material to work with considering the amount of wars that England was involved in along with her colonies anyway cheerio . Thanks for the excellent narration.
Good video.
Hi sir, can you make a documentary regarding the brief British occupation of Manila, which caused by the Seven Years War with France. Thanks
wonderful programme thanks! Can you tell me if there are any recorded voices of the hero's at the battle please?
Fascinating fact that he made it to the day after VE day.  I bet he let out a sigh of relief, and left.
Well my great great grandad is him
1:09, 2:28, actor Nigel Green plays his part superbly. His portrayal was believable!
“Zulus to the southwest … thousands of ‘em.”  Said with such a wonderful mix of nonchalance and gravity.  Still my favorite line.
" Yes Sir , the gentleman has a bottle ."
A superb example of Britain and its finest
“ You slovenly soldier” on dropping his bayonet on formation Very good video.. just super Thank you for some great information.. very interesting
Nigel Green ! Who else could have played that part ? But you are right . When my wife was a Cub Scout Den leader , one of the mothers got the notion of making diploma's from her new computer soft wear program to give the boys when they do what they are told . My wife brought up the question of why are you rewarding them for doing what it is they are suppose to be doing ? Besides , they get a badge for  recognition of what they accomplished . It doesn't matter that Bourne did not received the Victoria Cross , he got Nigel Green to play him !
What a life!
Hitch ...  your alive...I've seen you...Am I?...oh thanks very much...brilliant!!
Excellent! Good God man, button your tunic...
The "Little Princess" starring Shirley Temple does justice to the 1899 first Boer War in South Africa.
No idea why this was recommended to me but I watched it oddly enough. Amazing that he was born 20 mins from me in Balcombe. Its a small village with one pub.
What a truly brilliant story
"He maketh wars to cease in all the world. He breaketh the bow, and snappeth the spear in sunder"
That the BBC didn't recognize Frank Bourne's contribution to British history doesn't surprise me one bit. The rot began early.
Great story, many thanks
They don’t make folk like that anymore. Imagine if we went to war now we don’t have experienced men like that teaching lads how to shoot as firearms are so regulated by the nanny state. All young lads now know how to do is put on make up like women. China and Russia must be laughing at us. Frank Bourne would be turning in is grace if he knew what’s going on..
Fantastic summary of an absolute hero that quite literally made Britain Great. Thank you very much you have inspired me to look deeper in Colour Sergeant Frank Bourne.
I enjoyed that; thank you for posting it.
6 pence a day is only 9.1 pounds a year or $44 a year.   After deductions, 2.5 P a day is  3.8 pounds a year or $18 USD a year.  A US Civil war solder in 1864 received $$17(up from $13 a month ) and $34 in clothing a year added. Deductions rare (I have many pay muster rolls).  So. A US private soldier got $236 per annum (in greenbacks) in 1864 but British $18?   Seams too low.  Australian soldiers in 1915 got “5 Bob a day” or $1 usd.   English think 2 shillings
140 vs 4000 angry zulu armed with single shot rifles is somehow of a russian roulette game.
I guess you can look at him as brave, but he and his men invaded a land that wasn't there's and killed the natives. It's unfortunate that the Zulus didn't kill more of the British. Interesting history. Thanks.
What a lovely piece.  You've captured the spirit of the British Army that took an empire, and held it for generations.
AWLL RIGHT THEN ! Nobody told you to stop workin'...
The real Bourne legacy
As an old soldier, the Colour Sergeant epitomises the values I absorbed in the ranks and the Frank contempt I formed for the Officer Corps.
Hes turning in his grave seing the WOKE Black im a victim help me people of color im being abused because your all  white horrid people bolox happening in the country he and i served and defended so tbey could attack all white people who dont toe the WOKE agenda.  Thats what hes doing now.
Small man, stout heart. Amazing character and such a shame that we can't hear his voice from that interview. Thanks for sharing.
Zulu was the first movie i remember as a child and it enthralled me,still does,i watch it every time it shows on T.V.  I am glad Colour Sergeant Bourne lived a long happy life.I salute you Sir.
Really pleasant to listen to you and a very knowledgeable fellow.
brilliant
I think the best line Bourne has in the film is not a line at all. During the final Zulu charge, when Bourne and a number of men are hiding behind the redoubt a young soldier who looks like he's about to wet himself starts to waver. Bourne puts a hand on his shoulder to steady him. A true Platoon Sergeant / First Sergeant should be part big brother and part father to the enlisted. It was brilliant. Just a brief hand on the shoulder was enough to steady the young man for what they had to do. Reminded me of my old platoon sergeant from Iraq... who once told me "don't let the bad man get in your head" right before some nutty stuff happened. Brilliant.
Very tough to win a VC these days old chap..
2:00 "Hitch?" "Hitch, you're alive. I saw you." “I am? Oh, thanks very much.”
Mischaracterization hurt surviving family members. The alcoholic didn´t drink at all
💯💯💯
It's humbling isn't it   cometh the hour cometh the man
Whilst historically they were referred to as the "Kaffir wars", the word "Kaffir" is seen as very derogatory in South Africa with a dark history and thus I think that a more current description would be "Xhosa Wars" or the "Frontier Wars". What an interesting and distinguished life Bourne went on to live. Impressive that he went on to become a lieutenant colonel and get an OBE.
I did read the referenced transcripts and also noted his comments about the failure to easily slice op the large sacks providing a barrier.   Thank you for posting this video.
This film always makes me so proud to be British, English first.
That was fantastic! One of my favourite films ever! Very Surprised finding out that bourne was only 5’ 4” crumbs! The bravery of those soldiers was awesome 👏 I am lucky enough to have a Spear from Rorke’s. Drift with all the rust and a broken shaft (Probably done in or after the battle)
Same height as Audie Murphy if I am not mistaken. It seems that physical stature does not determine fierceness and ability.
Brilliant presentation..
Exactly,! True right to the point!😔🙏🇺🇸👍
Thanks for this fascinating video. Zulu is one of my favourite films. I am of the opinion that it is the best War film ever made. Doesn't matter that its not about WW1 or WW2. It is the best. You got my sub. Now I am off to check out your other Rorke's Drift videos.
Impressive chap, I have a Zulu war medal from the 2nd battalion of the foot, chap was sent home just prior to the invasion and served in India always wondered what he felt losing all him mates. An amazing piece of history this story is, an outstanding chap.
'Do ya top button up laddie'
This was only two years after Custer's Last Stand.
Superb video, so informative! and so well researched.
Bourne may of been only Five Foot three in height but in real life he was much much bigger.
LTC Bourne; Man of Honour. Soldier through and through.
Sargent Bourne is so bad ass even the grim reaper would ask politely if he's ready to go.
The bbc would probably rewrite history and blacken his good name and service. Sad but true
Thank you, that was great, you have won my subscription sir, I look forward to many more of your podcasts, take care.
A fascinating story Excellent 👍
Best quote was from rollcall "Hitch!? I saw you, you're alive"
do some research on William jones, he won the VC at Rourke's drift, he ended up in the work house in Manchester, hes now buried in Philips park Manchester, nothing seems to change when the vets leave the army, your a disposable oily rag. sad but true.
A  real credit to his profession .
The gentleman has a bottle sir
That was so fascinating, I will certainly subscribe.....sounds like the BBC of nowadays to be honest, anything to devalue or change Great British history in-line with woke/decolonized sensibilities.
"Very good sir, the sentries report Zulu's to south west,  thousands of 'em..."
Why were the stupid English in Africa anyway ?
i was walking past his house in Beckenham again today. it has a blue plaque. On Friday I was in the cemetery where he is buried.
"All right. nobody told you to stop working."
Dardenelles?  My grandfather's ship was sunk in that campaign and he rescued the Log Book thereby winning a commendation.  That's the family story anyway!  I don't know much about the war.
One of my favorite movies
Yeah it’s so brave to mow down an army that has no firearms and no artillery.... the brits really made the world a better place with the first use of concentration camps.... bravery? don’t you have any shame you egotistical limey fks?
Frank Bourne, Captain, 35 years service, several REAL COMBAT SITUATIONS.  I'm 5' 8", never had to fight in combat, no medals no pension (just SS) , this MAN towers over me.
The awarding system is a shambles. I was up for the VC in 2004 only to lose it for a lower award and it wasn't down to actions but politics
''Officer on parade!''
It amazes me that someone who fought in the Zulu wars, with a Martini-Henry, would have also seen the technology used in the mid-twentieth century.
"Hitch! You're alive, I saw you.
Alright then - Nobody told you to stop working
Best line when he's taking the roll of the survivors: *_Say, "Sir." -- Officer on parade._*
It would be appreciated if you could cover the Raid on St Nazaire, one of the highest decorated engaements of the last century and a turning point in WW2. It might take more than one video.
I salute this dedicated and courageous soldier, as I salute all like him!!
As an American I have always been fascinated with the air battles early on in WW 2.  Amazing planes and men.  I'd like to learn more about the top five British aces and how they compared to Germany's top five aces for the same time period.
Another brave serviceman is Leefe Robinson, VC, who shot down the first German Zeppelin over England. And his is quite a story that should be told in your professional manner.
"Subscribers, Chap! Faaasands of 'em!" Great vid as always!
Just for the record I have two Zulu spears given to me some 60+ years ago  they were picked up from the battlefield and bought home and given to me when I was a kid as he was going into a home and wernt allowed to take them
I came here to build a bridge…
Men of Steel all heroes
Frank FRANK Hitlers dead the war is over we are safe now.  "Praise God Now I can join all my old comrades Goodbye"
Amazing
91! I guess once you've faced down 4000 Zulus nothing seems that much of a problem.
Even in WW2 the average height of a British soldier was only 5'7". The poor nutrition of earlier times had not yet been resolved. Bourne would not have been out of the ordinary except for his giant heart.
Love the attempt at a Victorian working class accent ! Strangest thing I've heard since Dick Van Dyke !  The average height of common soldiers at that period was around 5'5". This is due to poverty and poor nutrition. Bourne wouldn't have looked that small at all. Go back further and the a stage height of a Roman soldier was around 5' 3 " . Size isn't the issue unless you buy into the post truth romanticism of the 21 st C.  I'd wager that the film ' Zulu ' is a far cry from the truth. The campaign was suicidal and if it wasn't for the noble warrior code of the Zulu , they would ALL have been wiped out.
"Mr Witt. Be quiet now will you, you'll upset the lads."
Looks like Pershore Abby in the background
He has a bottle sir
He seemed much older in the film.
The color Sargent calling roll said " I know you're alive. I saw you this morning. Answer the roll.! I can't remember the soldiers name.
Roll Call........Hitch!      Hitch!    Hitch your alive I've seen you. Oh thank you very much Colour Sergeant.  Answer Sir.....Officer on parade
“sergeant Major, officer in parade”. What a great program!  Every so often you come across a quality production on youtube and this is one.
Wow incredible history thank you R.I.P. color sergent bourne. Sorry for my shit typing im american poor and cant see cause healthcare. And frustrstion. Pray for us. Regardless of the idiots here. We need some therapy. Lol but thank you for that exelent history of one of the best of us. Kept his me alive always on service to country. To his people. Damn id by that man an expensive whiskey and shake his hand. He loved his countrymen and neighbors so much he served them by putting his body in the way of a spear or a bullet. Even the zulus recognuzed that courage at rorkes drift. Apprrcaite the reminder of hoe we used to act with honor and dignity.  Even if yoy didnt agree you recognaized what a person is form integruty
"and a bayonet sir, with some guts behinde it"
One of the best movies ever made great acting and fair to both sides A pity the  British army never incorporated a Zulu regiment like the Ghurkas and Sikhs had. I remember my father watched this film in a Welsh cinema in 1964 and  after the film finished alll the Welsh stood up and clapped and cheered the movie.
I’d like to hear about some the leftists at the BBC getting their a$$es kicked for willfully degrading British history and culture.
This just reminds me that there’s going to be some great movies about the Russian invasion of Ukraine
Amazing story.  Thanks so much! (now I'll have to see if we're related)
" Now Sir, be a good gentleman now" to the drunk missionary
Not a fan of the British in general but that movie is one of my favorites because I saw those soldiers less as British soldiers but more as courageous men willing to give their lives for each other ! They fought like lions against a vastly superior numbered force and deserved the final tribute that the Zulu warriors gave them ! They were truly bad ass fighters !
"Rear rank, fire! ONWARD! Rear rank, fire! ONWARD! Rear rank, fire! ONWARD!"
I was fortunate enough to see The Dalton VC at Buller Barracks Aldershot, for the same conflict.
Bromhead   “FIRE AT WILL”   Zulu “ IIm changing my name from will to Harry”
was his first name Jason ?
Enjoyed  that very much.
What a wonderful story!  Thanks for educating us.
Britain should not have been in South Africa.
Thousands of them
I remember as a young child, my father took my two brothers to see Zulu, he felt it was not a film for a young girl. Two weeks later my grandfather took me along with him to see it.  I can’t count the number of times I have watched over the years since.
Yes sir, the gentleman has a bottle
Can someone answer me this ok 1879 why didn't they have repeating rifles like USA soldiers against the Indians. It be more effective
I can only echo so many of the comments already made. Thank you. But his best line? "Be quiet, now Sir, there's a good gentleman; you'll upset the lads..."
here it is in HD https://youtu.be/0HKDhuG1GVM
Wow I wonder how I would have dun in the same situation.
All right, no body told you to stop working.
What a life Frank Bourne had.  From most humble beginnings, through the expansion of the Empire, to a high rank in the Army and to even live to see VE Day.  Somehow, his life seems to encapsulate Britain at its greatest.  The Nation sorely needs men of his calibre now.  May Lieutenant-Colonel Bourne have achieved eternal rest. And thank you for your research and video.
"No comedians please." when he's taking roll.
Invaders not defending.
My Great grandfather was one of the founding patrons of the Society of Miniature  Rifle and thus would have come across Bourne. My Great Grandfather was Member of Parliament for Edinburgh at the beginning of the 20th Centaury.
I've seen only the Monthy Python version of this battle
Those *were* some nasty sharp mangos!
This is such a wonderful story. Zulu has been one of my favourite films. I watched it first with my father a WWII veteran when I was 8 or 9 years old. Thanks for making this video. Simply amazing.
Sergeant Bourne"s  story is always worth a re - telling ,but didn"t know he ended - up a Lt .Col. and lived to a ripe old age ! .  Well done, a good yarn well told . Makes you proud to be British .  🧐
Is that what you call people who invade another land, a defender. lol
A pity to know that the actor that played Bourne, Nigel Green, comitted suicide in the 60's I believe.
Stay where you are hook!
Imagine thinking the BBC interview had no historical significance and throwing it away!
... "and a bayonet sir with some guts behind it. " Is also my favorite Color Sergeant Bourne quote.
"...Nobody told you to stop working..."
“Zulus sir, to the west, thousands of them “
I visited Rourke's Drift a few years ago and having met a few of the Zulus who run the attached 'Zulu village', I don't think Bourne's 5'3" would have been a disadvantage, as the Zulus themselves are not big people. They tend to be wiry, short , and athletic.
Men like Frank  Bourne are the  reason I am proud  to be British. Great video
Anything along the lines of Joseph Conrad's novels to place real history alongside the semi? fictitious.
Now there's a good gentleman.
What an amazing man!  Excellent video.  Scouts report Zulus to the south west, thousands of them
Itch?  Itch?  I know you're alive, I saw you!
What the hells a paper hanger?
How about Winston Churchill’s early military service in S. Africa?
Private Widdle: "Colour sergeant, there's ten thousand Zulus coming at us.....what shall I do?"  Answer: "Fill your rifle magazine, son; not your trousers!" (Ah, the imperturbable cool humour of the non-commission officers of the British Army.)
Is it possible to research the Tochi Valley Expeditionary Field Force as my Grandad, Capt. C.H.P Higgins, was a sergeant during that campaign
Just discovered the channel. Excellent video that’s answered questions I’ve had for over 40 years ..! Subscribed.
My Great Grandfather fought in South Africa in the 2nd Boer War. His medal says he fought as part of Brabants Horse. Do you have any info on this at all??
Thanks for this video! Being born in 65 I didn’t see this until I saw it on tv in the 70’s and was completely hooked! I later became an infantry captain in the USAR. I look forward to seeing the stories on the other defenders!
I read some place that he took a promotion in lieu of the Victoria Cross
S A L U T E............Color Sgt.
Fantastic information.  Thank you for sharing.  Cheers from the USA.
Sgt. Major Plumley is Color Sergeant Bourne reincarnate.
Don't ever take the film 'Zulu' as a history lesson. The film bears little relation to the facts. The film gives the impression that it was a regiment made up of mostly Welsh soldiers, yet it was actually an English regiment, made up of mostly English soldiers. The overemphasising of the Welsh element was no doubt due to Stanley Baker's involvement, even including fellow Welshman Richard Burton as the narrator. The Zulus didn't retreat in recognition of the soldier's bravery in holding out against them, they retreated because they knew a regiment of soldiers was making its way to Rourke's Drift.  The film is a great example of a great adventure story, very loosely based on an actual event. If you want the true account of what actually happened, then you'd be better served by looking elsewhere.
Great video! Thank you!
If the Listener transcript of the BBC interview with Bourne is available online, it would be most helpful if you would post a link.  If it is not available online, it would be most helpful to know how to obtain it.  And - as a Birmingham-born old soldier - I'd strongly suggest that you would be wise in future to give the 24th their full title (Second Warwickshire Regiment of Foot) when talking of them prior to Cardwell's reforms and their assignation to a Welsh recruiting area.  Worth also to cast an eye over the birthplaces of the eleven Rorke's Drift VC recipients.  Precious few woulda known the lyrics of "Men Of Harlech", trust me on this  ;-)
Excellent piece. Thanks.
Excellent presentation.
What a hero
"they know my voice.." or "do up yer button lad, where do you think you are.."
been a gaurd duty enough i feel his pain you miss out on a lot on gaurd duty and anything interesting always happened when it was my turn.
was a great movie
I SAW THE MOVIE AND I LOVED IT, YES, THE SERGEANT CARED ABOUT HIS MEN BUT ALWAYS KEEP A STRAIGHT AND STRONG POSTURE. REMINDED ME OF MY SERGEANT DURING MY TRAINING DURING THE CIVIL WAR IN CENTRAL AMERICA.
I live down the road, I still can't find his house in balcombe!
My favourite Sgt Bourne line is also one of my favourite lines in ANY film. ( The other all-time fave is from Goldfinger - "you expect me to talk ? No Mr Bond I expect you to DIE !" This partly due to Nigel Greene's superb appearance, demeanour and performance but also because it typifies Britishness to the core - or at least Britishness as it used to be. The missionary played by Jack Hawkins was drunk in the stockade and wreaking havoc to the troops morale. Sgt Bourne rebukes him VERY firmly but also with respect due to their differing social status. "Now then Mr Witt, Sir. Be quiet will you, there's a good gentleman. You'll upset the lads !"  I've replayed this line over and over for the sheer joy of the thing. Wonderful !!!
Please express your opinion of the movies accuracy.
I worked in Gloucester and a local guy told me Hook from zulu was buried in a little ghurchyard 20 mins from my job! I went to show my respects and found it! apparently he died penniless!
Outstanding! Thank you so much. What a distinguished career from a distinguished gentleman.
“Do your button up lad”
Well done! Thank you for creating this.
Former 1960s Scots Guards nco AGREES, an amazing man, a real HERO
"Do your tunic up man , who do you think you are".......?.
What a wonderful piece of history you produced..thankyou
Frank Bourne might have been 5foot3inches tall, but there was a hell of a lot of soldier in him. An excellent example of duty in Frank Bourne. 🇬🇧
Fascinating!!! What a man
He was my favorite
As a history enthousiast,  i like these stories a lot.  I would like to learn more about the combined british and dutch forces, during the war for spanish succesion. For example the capture of Gibraltar.  with much regard, a dutch conscript corporal from the 90's.
I’m in South Africa and going to the battlefields and Rorkes drift Jeremy
I always loved how this film portrayed the Zulus. Brave, fierce, skilled, persistent, honorable, organized, disciplined, basically the opposite of how they're viewed by conventional wisdom as helpless victimized children. They deserved that portrayal.
Stay where you are, Hook.
Sgt Bournes Grandson narrates the transcript of the BBC interview and it is on YouTube,, John Benson channel
Your sir with a bayonet and some guts behind it sir .His famous line.
He would have got more respect from the privates because he came through the ranks and not like the officers who bought there ranks by coming from families with money. Even in my time in the armed forces you respected men who made their way up the ranks instead of the one's who went to places like Sandhurst for officer's because the truth was even with their training they just didn't have a clue
I always like learning new things and this was certainly new to me. I have watched the movie several times and often wondered how close it was to actual events but quite frankly too lazy to do the research. Like many, I had pictured the real Colour Sgt Bourne much like the movie version. I was a senior non-commissioned officer that received a commission as well in the U.S. Navy so I could picture those attributes displayed in the movies as being characteristic if not accurate. While the courage and professionalism were portrayed accurately the physical stature and demeanor not so much. That is a small price to pay for a cinematic storyline. Thank you so much for this presentation.
Tremendously well done  What an utter legend and after all he went through no ptsd but instead wanting to fight at sixty
Really enjoyed that, thank you. Can I place a request that you do a piece on my own childhood hero, ‘Sniper Dennison’? What a man
'There's a good gentleman.'
in the movie hes a gunnery sergeant is that the same as a colour sergeant ?
Alright then.  Nobody told you to stop working.
My favourite  " steady lad...steady"
"  spit SPIT !!!  SPIT !!!...",   the bugle scene.
Proud to say that he is a distant uncle of mine
so glad I stumbled on to this story.
It's a crying shame that recording was binned. To hear the voice of a Victorian soldier, and one who fought in such an incredible action at that, would be incredible.
Yes sir, the gentleman has a bottle. You're upsetting the lads, quiet now, theres a good gentleman.
A great man
There is a plaque on the wall of the house where Frank Bourne lived in Beckenham. My brother lives round the corner. Every time I walked past it I thought of him and Rorkes Drift.
I think a video about the incredible life of Field Marshal Bill Slim who rose from private to field marshal would be very interesting. His comments about the soldierly qualities of the very many different nationalities he commanded are great food for thought
Swift promotion for British Army standards..the English don't earn their stripes lightly
Thank you for this.
can yu do one on the essex rgt taking the first french eagle ,and how the got the name pompadour's
Legend…what a life..
I always thought he didn't get the Victoria Cross for that exact reason he did what was required from a colour sergeant the standars at the time were high.
As a raw recruit in the Australian Army, this movie  was shown to us all as part of our basic training
Very interesting. Thank you.
excellent thank you
My favorite quote was from Colour Sergeant Bourne; "The sentries report Zulus to the southwest...  Thousands of 'em."  What a chilling deliver of that line.
Rorke's Drift is a piece of British history that will live on and on much like the Spartans at the Hot Gates and it is the men like Frank Bourne who have made it more than history but legendary.
mine fave was "alright men no one told you to stop working"
That a recorded interview with this man was thrown away for “having no historical value” tells you everything you will ever need to know about the BBC.
What a exellent video ive subscribed and now watching your clips thanks ,Neil
Stature is never necessarily a good example of stature of heart.  He apparently had the heart to be a good leader.
That was an excellent presentation. I can still vividly remember watching this movie as an 8 year old in 1964. The sound of what we thought was that of a distant train in the hills, turning out to be the Zulus terrified me. It's funny how these things stick in my memory. Watching it again in years later, impressed upon me the bravery of the soldiers against such overwhelming numbers. It righfully deserves it's place in our military history.
Can anyone tell me where did Nelson lose his arm and why is it that almost nobody in Britain knows about it? 🤔 Sorry to mention the war, but while you find out I'm flying home to Santa Cruz of Tenerife.
Nigel green definitely stole the show from Caine in zulu and he almost did it to Caine again in the Ipcress file which they both starred in.
"Do your tunic up!  Do it up!  Who do you think you are, man?".....Priceless!!
Why are these wars but when others come to the UK  and kill is crime ?  Prince harry fir example . How many died at the end if his gunship yet a talib shoots him in london hes a terrorist .  They cry about a irish song a palistine flag yet ignore israeli ukraine flags and are about to ram a poppy down our necks .  Hypocrites all
A charmed life and about the same sized man as America’s Audie Murphy.  Well done, lads.  Well done.
The Zulu king told his men not to attack a fortified place, it was one of his son's who did so, and the end of the film with the zulus praising the bravery is a lie, it never happened
Bourne, proof that you can be 5'3" and still a giant of a man. Remarkable fellow.
A prayer's as good as a bayonet on a day like this!
I would like to know about general jam3s Wolfe
Favourite quote? Easily: "Sentries report Zulus to the south west, Sir......thousands of them".
Being a Welsh teenager at the time of course I saw the film in the cinema (and promptly fell in love with Stanley Baker). Now I am a senior citizen of 70 and the movie still thrills me.Thank you so much for adding all this extra information.
What a man.  A hero in every way.
Do we know his final resting place?
No comedians please
EXCELLENT video. Thank you!
Hook, who was awarded a VC for his actions defending the hospital went on to join the militia guarding the British Museum. He donated a cup for shooting competitions between the BM and the British Museum (Natural History) in Kensington.
"Say 'Sir'. Officer on parade!"
I have enjoyed your videos. You have asked for suggestions for future research and video. I would like to suggest the great siege of Gibraltar (1779 to 1783) and its governor at the time General George Eliott. There is so little about the siege on the Internet.
Button your collar lad.
Button up that Tunic Lad 💯👌🏻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿✌🏻
There were survivors from Isandlwana, though few if any of them wore the famous red tunic. One Horace Lockwood Smith-Dorrien, then a second lieutenant, was one of only five officers to escape, attributing his survival in part to his blue, rather than red tunic. His survival would prove fortunate for more than himself as the high point of Smith-Dorrien’s career was to come during the long retreat to the Marne river ordered by Field Marshal Sir John French in 1914. Smith-Dorrien had become by then a full General and at Le Cateau, on 26 August he was forced to halt his column, reportedly commenting, “Very, well, gentleman, we will fight”. It was a decision taken to prevent the Germans from overwhelming the column on the march. A call from BEF HQ, ordering him to continue the retreat; was refused, as the men were already fighting. This rear-guard action stalled the German advance saving the British Army from a much larger force.
thanks, what a hero.
Colour Sgt. Bourne: "All right, nobody told you to stop working."
Steady Lads !
The reason that he wasn't awarded was because he was an NCO
Only complaint about this movie is the Zulus often seem to be standing around waiting to be killed.  In The Battle of Isandlwana, not so much.
Great video Chris, well researched and presented. You certainly highlight the courage and bravery of the British forces down through the ages. Fantastic!
i as a private soldier was posted to Wrexham North Wales was led to believe that this is where the soldiers in the Zulu war were trained and sent from the barracks Hightown Barracks is still there and evev the mascot was housed there in 1969 Cpl Yeo R C T
I was thoroughly disappointed by the complete lack of s***** CGI. All those extras they hired to make a brilliant movie really pisses me off. I require fake looking CGI.
where is CS bourne interned?
A very informative and excellent produced video. Thank you very much. Now subcribed to watch more!!
If the film Zulu had been real life, Colour Sergeant Bourne would be the only member of the garrison not to be court martialed. Queens regulations stated that all soldiers should have a moustache.
A great video Nigel, about a great individual and fine upstanding soldier, in Clout Sergeant Bourne. I, like many, were perplexed, watching the movie, wondering why he wasn’t one of the VC recipients, in what could be argued, as history suggests, was a slightly over decorated battle, notwithstanding the courage of the soldiers involved.  Why I say this is, is one example you may look at Nigel, although not British as such, was 6th Battalion’s Royal Australia Regiment’s stand, at Long Tan, during the unpopular Vietnam War. Essentially two platoons, of 106 men, fought off around 2000 NVA army soldiers, highly trained, with mortars and automatic weapons, with no defensive positions. Decorations were two DSO’s to higher commanding officers behind the lines, one MC, one DCM, two MM’s and a handful of MID’s. It’s a good comparison to being ripped off, when looking at Rorke’s Drift. Thankfully a handful of wrongs, have been righted.  I have now subscribed to your channel Nigel, after this excellent showing. Looking forward to watching some more.
An excellent video and what I would give to be able to hear Colour Sergeant Frank Bourne's voice today if that audio recording had not had been binned. I went to Rorkes Drift and Islawanda back in 2000. From what I remember, their was scant little there except for large boulders painted white for where certain soldiers or guns were lost at Islawanda. Rorke's drift itself was very little except for some manikins of Zulu's and British soldiers and a very small market. I guess with the hospital lost to the fire not much remained. I hope to think that it has gained much more in historical status since. The biggest thing that did strike me though was the high rate of alcoholism and the number of suicides from the soldiers of this battle years later. Something that is not mentioned at all in historic records. Having said that, can you imagine being a young soldier and living through what they did? Thanks for sharing!
Thank you for the video, do you have a link as to the interview of Colour Sgt Frank Bourne?
Some Corps in the Australian Army, use this film as a training exercise for new recruits
Honestly I was cheering for the Zulu army.. they are pussy’s for fighting with guns
Nigel Greens portrayal of Bourne really caught my interest in later years, his stance against the Zulu warrior was a brilliant moment. I looked further into his life and others at Rorkes drift. This has added further to that. Many thanks.
Grateful for your research. My humble thanks.
"OLD SOLDIERS NEVER DIE.,.. THEY JUST FADE AWAY🎖️🪖🇬🇧
"Hitch? Hitch I saw you, you're alive!"
Surely a man guided by God the youngest son with a distinguished career and died one  day after Germany surrendered
A different breed of men. True professional soldiers. That mustache is fricking awesome. I'm glad he did well 👍
In the movie he quoted Psalm 46:9 and described the whole psalm as the soldiers Psalm. To me that was a great line in the movie.
Let’s be ‘avin’you!
This boy Bo Mackinlay from my village in Scotland fought the Nazis for 5 years and when he got to the Rhine he quit and said; I didn’t join to invade someone’s country, I’ll awa hame then Got six months in Colchester
As a former NCO there is no doubt the back bone of the enlisted force is men like color sergeant Bourne. To lead because of your conviction because of the oath you swore to God and Country can only remind one of his or her duty and what we as military men and women will be called upon to perform.
Very much enjoyed getting to know the color sgt
Do a video on the British soldiers working their ticket to get home.
What happened to Lord Chambsford (spelled wrong I know) who should have been hung foe stupidity and having an Ego that ignored the slaughter of his men !!!
Zulu is my all time favorite movie . Favorite quote " Alright , nobody told you to stop working . "
Fantastic
Love this sort of thing, I did a family tree and found out, in 1860 my gt gt grandfather went to India after joining the Staffordshire 1st of foot, back then, they took their wives and children along. It would be incredible to learn more
Amazing life story of an original Victorian man who's real life story would have been forgotten thank you for sharing
Awesome
The Zulu regiment at The Drift were not the young Impi's but older "married" men who did not see auction at the drift.
Why then do you British allow your country to be transformed into a nation of Muslim immigrants? Retain your history! Limit any immigration!
One of the true injustices of the film was the depiction of Private Henry Hook VC. Hook was far from a malingering malcontent. Methodist preacher and teetotaller, he was considered a model soldier. I always thought it so wrong that the memory of a brave and worthy man should have trashed just for the sake of some additional colour in Endfield’s otherwise great film.
GREAT ACCOUNT OF AN OUTSTANDING BRITISH COLOR SERGEANT AND LATER BRITISH OFFICER !!
How long till someone calls this racist?
" All right then. Nobody told you to stop working "
Imagine living to 90 years of age and witnessing the most devastating war in human history come to an end...  I'd say that's a pretty satisfying to go out.
RIP frank bourne sir🙏🏻✌️
A final anecdote from the Zulu film isn't actually from Colour Sergeant Bourne this time, but from Stanley Baker in his role of Lieutenant Chard - and is rather sad than amusing. After the battle, both Chard and Bromhead (played by the brilliant Michael Caine) were discussing the whole bloody affair with regret and sadness when Chard utters his unforgettable final words in the film - "And I came here to build a bridge" - a truly melancholy statement after the horrible bloodshed both officers and their men had just been through, but had not chosen for themselves or indeed, for their Zulu enemies who lay dead around Rorke's Drift.
Another good anecdote of Colour Sergeant Bourne in the Zulu film was when he ordered the soldiers stationed on the hospital roof to shoot at the Zulus who had rifles on the hill. He then told them to "Fire at the smowe-k" !!!  Nigel Green was the perfect actor for this role, absolutely brilliant, I would say.
What’s that shooting colour sgt?  A rifle Hughes!  Top remark!
Excellent video, what a great man.  Just a pity about the idiot BBC destroying the sound recording.
Thank you very much for the facts about Frank Bourne. I suppose that, like many others, I tend to mentally see Nigel Greene's fantastic portrayal of him from the film!
"Hitch... Hitch, I saw you. You're alive."
The average height of British men in the 1870s was 167.05cm (5ft 5in). By the 1970s it was 177.37cm (5ft 10in) largely due to improved public health and nutrition.
Even with just 5'3" I can imagine the real Colour Sergeant Bourne to have been a "towering" presence on the battlegrounds of Rourke's Drift that day! I was very glad to hear that he went on to have an excellent career in the British army and even lived to witness VE Day in Britain in May 1945. What a life, and gladly a far better one than many of the VC holders from Rourke's Drift experienced.
What does Colour Sergeant Bourne say to the Swedish Missionary, locked up in a small shed, when he attempted to talk a young soldier into not fighting...(in the film); "Mr. Witt , sir, be quiet now will you, like a good gentleman, you're upsetting the lads!"  (or words to that effect). Absolutely brilliant!
Loved the movie! Remember the first time I saw it in the very early 1970’s. I was a resident physician on call and saw this movie in the TV guide. Figured what the heck, nothing else to do, so I watched it. Loved it and still own a copy. Must have seen it some 10 plus times. I was impressed how well the Zulus were portrayed! Many years later during my first IronMan triathlon, when things were starting to get difficult, I would start singing “Men of Harlech” or even the Zulu chants (admittedly not very good on the words). Great movie…at least for me!
Great story - love to hear about what you think of the siege of Kut.
"Thr Gentleman has a bottle.'
Apart from the more commonly remembered quotes: • “They’ll know my voice when they ‘ear it, sir” • “Stay where you are, ‘ook!” • “Alright, nobody told you to stop workin’, you lead backsided… get sweatin’!” • “Keep your voices down… officer on parade” • “Yes sir, he has a bottle” • “Well, as far as I can remember, sir, it goes something like this: ‘He maketh wars to cease in all the world, He breaketh the bow and snappeth the spear in sunder’ “
Probably went on to murder more civilians trying to protect their land.
My suggest would perhaps be……. TE Lawrence or Maybe Colonel David Sterling and or Paddy Maine any of these would be great to hear about
The anglos would have been more heroic if they hadn't been invaders
Anything on the Black Watch, Royal Highland Regiment, 42nd foot please
so he saw the Zulu war, the Burmese war, WWI, and WWII. Wow.
Zulus to the south west , thousands of em
"The gentleman has bottle"
Henry lang mbe vc
Beautifully done history. Thank you.
Im an ex service man 4/19PWLH and l think its a shame that theres more ex service men who deserved a VC who did not get one
"Officer on Parade."
No surprise that the BBC binned the interview. They have form in so doing from innovative comedy shows to first class serious interviews.
Love the film Zulu. They should all be remembered and honoured.
As a I B C historian but very great an amazing reader of your site. Great mate!
Chard was smart enough not to go charging into the face of the enemy,  but being an engineer,  placing the men in a defensive position, and  not a aggressive one.
Frank like so many Blokes did his job no fuss ..loyal to his Country Great Britain 🇬🇧..nice one Frank 👍
Brilliantly presented , the detail is fabulous 👍
I doubt that we will see that type of courage from a soldier today. If the movie had portrayed him as he really was, the heroics would have been greater. But Hollywood only wants BIG heroes. Hollywood has rewritten history only to be more entertaining...not true.
We have a Rifle from Rorkes Drift in our museum. I wonder what it might be worth.? And we have a framed copy of that Print.
But sad we had to invade their country it was not ours to invade. Queen victoria lost count of how many countries we invaded . Putin spdings to mind. Aling with hitler. So yes brave men but shit governments
Excellent info thank you😊😊
I loved HOOK😁😁🥲🤣
Very interesting and a wonderful commentary - thankyou
An amazing man thank you for explaining what happened with the colour Sgt he achieved a lot in his life and never forgot his duty
Hi there, Great piece on Bourne. Like yourself,  I can remember being overwhelmed by the Movie "Zulu" when I first  viewed it in the 60's. That Stiff upper lip approach and the Blood Red Uniform of the British Victorian Soldier have Always held my attention. I wonder if you could do a piece on EVELYN WOOD VC also served in the Zulu War. But also Served in The Crimea War, India where he earned the VC and, as mentioned, Zulu War. His Career Flourished. And went on to be Adjutant - General then a Field Marshal and was one of the major reforming General's  who lay the foundations for the Army's success in the Great War. Regards John.
The Colour Sgt.'s facial Hair is called, "Cavalry Whiskers"! Mutton Chops were Not connected to ones Mustache as usually M.C. wearers normally Do No sport one! M.C. wearers grew them straight down the Sides of Thier faces, & Brits usually grew them into what they called "Piccadilly Weepers"!
Excellent, thanks!
thank you so much  if only history at school could have been this good,  i could not say how many times i have watched zulu, it is in my top 5, thank you for letting us know what happened to this magnificent soldier who gave his all. two survivors from rorkes drift are buried in philips park near where my daughter is buried, i hope they are keeping her safe lol its an honour to have her buried in the same grounds, the graves were discovered by a journalist i believe and he arranged for them to be cleaned up and sorted out which is the least they could have done, WE WILL REMEMMBER THEM XXXX
Excellent presentation!..all well said sir...you got my attention...BBC bod tossing away sound script should be jailed!
My God almighty a few pennies a day, well well well
Absolutely so indeed, he held them all together til the end, and got them through it, and I bet there are many more Sgt Borne's in British Soldiers through the centuries
Very interesting film.  Thank you.  How about telling the story of Tom Abraham?  A British officer serving with the US army in Vietnam.  Captured by the V C and held in  semi submerged cell he managed to escape and return to friendly territory.
My favourite quote, delivered so deadpan: "Yes sir, the gentleman 'as a bottle"
All of them that died that day should have received the VC
Thanks for your tale of Bourne it was well presented, you asked of stories that i would like to hear and the story i would like told is, I Think one of the Greatest, but little known story from military history is the story of operations jaywick and rimau led by Ivan Lyon, yes there has been a book and a TV film made about it but its not well known....
Like many of the comments, I could believe that Frank Bourne did not receive the Victoria Cross but I'm only going from the film.  Thank you for explaining the situation.  But he was worthy of a VC.
Pleased that he saw the finish of WW2.A brave and humble soldier.
He was a Murderer
Good idea sharing this, much appreciated,
It was not an Anglo war it was a British war
I served Afghanistan 2009 and 2012 I was brought up on this film in the 1970s every Christmas on 3 channels, but I remember my dad who served with the glorious GLOUSTERS in Nicasia and Kenya that to be awarded the Gorge cross in battle means you have about 70% survival chance of that situation....To get the Victoria..well you shouldn't be alive and the metal is so rare because the medal's are made from a bronze cannon we retrived from the russkies in the Crimea war
What do you mean "illiterate troops"? Do you mean the largely Welsh soldiers who 'defeated' the Zulus those days?
All the amazing soldiers who have put it on the line in countless wars for us to end up going into a digital dictatorship,  begs belief how the world is now controlled by media fear and propaganda
I find it amazing that Heroes are always portrayed as big men, when heroes come in all shapes and sizes. Mt father was born in Koenigsberg East Prussia.  Then part of Germany,  he was "encouraged" to join the Whermacht.  He won the Iron Cross second class at the Battle of Stalingrad. He was wounded six times, he was shot just before Stalingrad fell apart and was flown out.  Like Frank Bourne he was only 5' 5". Not all heroes are muscle bound giants.
I did enjoy it but it makes me wonder why the English people put up with the “royal family.”
Splendid video.  Thank you very much.  An Old Soldier
Great warriors are great warriors, but to use them in unjust wars is utterly disrespectful to them, their courage, and their duty to follow orders!
Thanks for posting a lucid and interesting account of the man and the events. A real man, a man’s man; very hard to find today in this world of woke. Today’s young British men are simply not in the same league as their forefathers.
Great video! Only correction: Bourne was 5'6", albeit still nearly a foot shorter than Nigel Green. Of interesting note: The second highest-ranking NCO at Rorke's Drift, Sergeant Henry Gallagher (who's not in the film) was just twenty-three. Of the remaining section leaders, who were all junior to Gallagher in date-of-rank, Sergeant George Smith was thirty-nine, Sergeant Joseph Windridge was around thirty-five, with the recently demoted to corporal William Allan the same. Corporal Alfred Saxty, who was promoted to sergeant the day after the battle to replace the badly injured Allan (who still held a sergeant's billet), became the youngest section leader at just nineteen. Most of the private soldiers under their charge would have ranged between eighteen and twenty-one years of age.  I personally think Nigel Green would have been better cast as Commissary Dalton, who gets arguably the worst depiction of the film, outside of Henry Hook's character assassination. The real Dalton was 6' tall (so a giant for the time) thickly muscled and a highly experienced retired Army Senior NCO. Peter Gill, who gave a respectable depiction of Private John Williams (Fielding), VC, would have been a more accurate casting choice for Bourne in terms of age. Still, Zulu is a great film despite its many inaccuracies, and is what got most of us interested in the Zulu War. When writing my own novels on the conflict (which to date is the only series to cover the entirety of the war) I still gave a nod to the film by giving some of Nigel Green's film lines to my version of Bourne.
Allriiiiight no one told you to stop working.
My very favourite line from Zulu came from Colour Sergeant Bourne himself when faced with overwhelming odds from the Zulu Army, he says to a young recruit: Button your tunic, lad. Where do you think you are?
That's a good gentleman, your scaring the lads....
What an extraordinary life! Deserves a movie or a TV show!
The plural of Zulu is Zulu, not Zulus.
When we were the best 🇬🇧😊this guy was history n bravery at its very greatest, absolutely brilliant
Didnt finish the job ...
I served in the U.S. Marines as a helicopter gunship pilot through two tours in Vietnam.  I have read all the accounts I could find of the Battle of Rorke's Drift, starting with the account in "Our Empire Story" when I was a boy of twelve.  And, I have watched the movie "Zulu" multiple times.  I have always thought that Rorke's Drift was the best example of what properly led soldiers can do, even in the worst of battlefield conditions.  From the accounts I have read, and from the movie, I think Color Sgt. Bourne epitomized everything that a non-commissioned officer should be.  A truly magnificent soldier!
"Be quite now sir, theres a good gentleman, you're upsetting the lads"
Good morning...excellent piece...I would love to hear about Willie Redmond MP....brother of John Redmond MP the  famous nationalist Leader
Thank you so much for this illuminating sequel to the history so many of us thought we knew.
I first saw this in my pajamas, as a child, at a callifornia drive-in theater while visiting my father and stepmother when the movie first came out. I have since watched it many times, along with its tactical predecessor, Zulu Dawn. Two pieces of largely authentic movie making that would be impossible today.
Come along now, that's a good gentleman.
Jolly goodly, off to kill folk where they did neither belong or need to be! .
Steady lad .steady ....
Did UK fight to free Peru or any Irish soldiers against the Spanish?
No news in years has made me first so exited, and then so upset, as learning about that interview and its fate.
Only the bbc could throw away that interview.
Surprised you didn’t mention that he is buried in Beckenham and his grave is well cared for
I discovered your channel a few weeks ago and I absolutely love it. Very entertaining and informative. Great work!
Wonderfully presented pity cannot hear Borne`s voice 😢
No comedians please officer on parade
an outstanding, yet humble soldier. sounds like he was a great human being as well
What a man. He walked the talk for sure.
How about the history of the Men of Harlech song, which was sung at the end of the movie? Having trouble finding any information about this song sung by the Welshman in the 1400s!
All very interesting, I would perhaps not call him an example of Victorian heroism as the defenders of Rorkes Drift are suggested to have massacred many injured Zulu prisoners. A different time and all that. But i do wonder if when the world condemned German massacre's of prisoners if he ever reflected on what his army did back then.
Roll call....hitch ..hitch your alive I saw you!.
Thank you, that was eye opening. To have been able to hear his voice would have been amazing, but that's the beeb for you.
I'd like to hear about William F Mcfadzean VC.  The YCV Battalion (14th Battalion Royal Irish Rifles) Thank you
'You're all going to die! I'm afraid he's found a bottle, sir...'
"they know my voice when they hear it"
Excellent. Thank you very much for recording this tribute to Lt Col Bourne.  Phillip Taylor MBE
Well they certainly don’t make them like him anymore
At about 14.33 ... ' was awarded the OBE ... The Order of the British Empire ...'  is totally wrong - OBE is not The Order of the British Empire
Well done sir
As a Met Police officer in the Brixton riots of the 1980s, our small unit was suddenly about to be swamped by a huge chanting and charging crowd of black faced rioters. To my surprise, initial fear and apprehension turned to complete, sheer bloody anger, and a clear desire to take as many of them with me as I could before I went down. Weirdly, at that moment, Rorkes Drift and the resolution of the defenders came to my mind - except that this time it was us with the shields and sticks whilst they had the projectiles. Thankfully they stopped short and relied on raining missiles on to us rather than physically engage us. Shortly, a relief force arrived and we drove them back.  The experience stuck with me of course, and I felt grateful for the feeling that I had had the very slightest, but still significant, connection with what our brave forebears had experienced!
Excellent video and well researched much appreciated thank you!
My uncle who emigrated with me, I was a US citizen was enamored by The Sargent.  He had returned from duty in tie German occupation forces.  He told me that the The Sargent reminded him if his Sargent. He was very clear that it was the noncommissioned officers that were the glue of the British Empire.  I think this is more obvious than ever in light of the Ukraine War.
I always loved the Colour Sergeant Bourne in the movie and it was refreshing to put a life history to the face in the movie! Excellent!
I think it's possible to be proud of the brave men in that army, without being proud of the people who made the decision to invade South Africa, and all those other Countries forced into the British Empire. The sort of things that Germany did in WW2, were the sort of things that the UK did in the 19th Century, an irony not lost on Herman Goering.
This is an easy one his offspring emergrated to US and his future relatives joined the CIA THEN LEFT AND MADE A SERIES OF GOOD FILMS IE JASON BOURNE.
CSgt Bourne was doing his job. As a former Royal Engineers officer I was very lucky to be supported in my time as a 2Lt by very able SNCOs.
It wasn't the Buffalo River, that's in East London, Eastern Cape, it was the Buffels River, a small but geographically important difference.  Great presentation btw, wonder what would happen these days with 'modern soldiers'.........
"Steady, lad!  We can hold them off here.  Have a wee dram of Laphroaig, to build your courage".  Yessir, takes "stiff upper lip" to a whole new level..  God save the Queen!
We visited Rorke's Drift in September 1995. We stayed at The Penny Farthing, not far from Rorke's Drift. The owner was an historian and gave us lots of information. We traveled to Rorke's Drift and were surprised by the lack of much there to remember the event. The museum (we were told by the curator) had been open about three years. There was little else there. No hotels or shops. There was a diorama of the scene in the museum. From memory, the notes with it stated that almost 20,000 rounds had been fired, which was almost all of the ammunition held. In my view, I think there would have been more Zulu casualties. The defenders would have been firing at   short range or point blank. I accept that there would have been misses, but accounting for the several hundred wounded, you still have maybe 16,000 bullets that failed to find their mark. We will return at some time, although the site has changed greatly since we were there.
Brilliantly presented, I really enjoyed the story of Frank Bourne an amazing and courageous soldier, who achieved so much in his long life. I joined the army aged 15 years in 1960 and met many men who reminded me of Colour Sergeant Frank Bourne, their manner and their bearing. Many of those I knew had served during WWII and were coming to end of their service and in some ways laid the blueprint of how we, in later service, would conduct ourselves. I am now a retired British Army Officer.
Best movie ever!
"Alright, nobody told you to stop working, You lead backsided.....Get sweating!"
I love this film and the Zulu war!!!
Perhaps you could do a show in Captain Little:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Little
fascinating, subscribed😀
Would love to hear about the pals battalions that were formed in Dublin and in other parts of Ireland at the start of WW1
Steady lad steady
Button up Your Tunic Lad.
Do your button up lad'
As a SNCO, its nice to know that, like myself, a mans stature is not measured by his height (I'm 5'4'') but by his deeds. There really is no meritocracy like the Army.
Fantastic Story an incredible man.
In the film, the two commissioned officers are often excited and angry but Colour Sergeant Bourne never loses his composure.  Even during his bayonet fight, one of the most dramatic moments in a film with many such moments, he is in complete control.  Compare his movements and facial expression with that of the young Zulu warrior he is fighting.  His greater skill and self-confidence, the result of years of training and combat experience, are obvious.  Like the sword fight near the beginning of the Seven Samurai, there is never any doubt about who will win.
A rifle Hugh's
Yes, Zulu was a great movie. However now I am old it seems ethically questionable.. I am from another country.
On your submissions for more stories... There was an SOE guy called The White Rabbit who escaped a concentration camp... his story is very interesting.
Gonville Bromhead (Michelle Caines character) in reality came from the village of Thurlby his local town was called Bourne.
Steady lads steady..
Sixpence, not six pennies, please!
When the Zulus pick up a thousand Henry rifles from the battlefield and their reserves are coming for your 20,000 rounds of ammunition, you really have no choice but to make a stand and fight.  Irony that almost all those rounds were spent defending those rounds.  Can you imagine the embarrassment for Chelmsford if he lost both the rifles AND the ammo?(!)
I can imagine my own thoughts on a Sergeant Frank Bourne quote that probably was never said, but I can almost hear him say, I do not so much fight for Queen and country lad as much as I fight  so that my precious family can eat whilst being sheltered
"Nobody told you to stop workin"
BBC destroying pro  british material .. shock horror
Spit on it boy
A rife Hughes....!
As a South African...this was nice to watch. Interesting.
Wonderful! First saw film in 1964 aged 22. Really enjoyed your presentation. Thanks
An amazing story and an incredible man
Superb. Thank you for that.
From Zulu "Yes Sir!.....Officer on Parade!" Lol
Enjoyable vid thanks
One of my favourite scenes in this superb classic is when colour sergeant politely asks the drunk preacher, played by Jack Hawkins,  to remain quiet as he's upsetting the lads.
Genuine hero
When Zulu was released at our local cinema, my friend and I managed to stay in and watch it twice on the first day !! And in 2016, my son , who lived in South Africa at the time, drove us both down to Isandlwana and Rorkes Drift to visit the battlefield sites. Still cant believe I went there , so amazing !!
Thank you so much for sharing this,  very interesting .
A great video and well worth watching.I would like to see something about tge WW2  campaign in Sicily abd Italy.   My Dad was a dispatch rider for the Royal Signals during that campaign as well as the earlier campaign in North Africa...
A few years ago while waiting with my wife for her three monthly checkup at the Radiology Clinic in Hereford, I got chatting with a bloke who is a descendant of Bourne. He told me the Colour Sergeant had died in the 1930s. A long and full life in service.  RIP.
Wonderful informative video  . Thank you so much .
Went to Rorke's Drift on the 121st anniversary of the battle, and also visited the Isandhlwana battlefield of the night before. Awesome! And to hear the Zulu women singing in the church at Rorke's Drift was fantastic.

Sir Hue Dowding.. please
Very interesting..thank you..
Here’s a lead, Knights of the Golden Horseshoe, Virginia
I think he turned down the VC for a promotion.
Alright!  Nobody told you to stop working!
What did Stanley Baker say at the end of the film? If you ever go to Africa you will realise the disgrace of what we did there. Doesn't make the film any less great then it was
Do your tunic up there's a good lad . One of my favourite films
I would truly want to believe and be proven wrong,  especially being ex services my self back in the 1970s,  that our current Tommies and especially senior NCOs are on par with the men who were  at Rourke's Drift , Colour Sergeant Frank Bourne and all our soldiers up to WW2. Sadly we now see so often in the news, reports of soldiers and  NCOs commuting crimes, which I really can't record happening when I was serving with Joint Forces. What ever the criticisms in regard to brutality between the ranks, snobbery and poor living conditions in Victorian times,  I believe we simply no longer have the men of the quality of Frank Bourne. Even though I expect it was exaggerated in Zulu, it was such men  who were the backbone of the British Army and over 300 years allowed England to become the most respected and copied nation ever in the world.  A film I too never stopped watching and enjoying, especially the "Front rank fire.........fire, fire, fire" scene and the look on the men's faces at what they had achieved in the power and success  of a well-trained and disciplined line of men fighting a much larger attacking force. Would appreciate any recently long termed senior NCOs who came out, say 10 years ago, and kept in contact with their serving comrades coming back at me and 'factually telling me I am wrong
Just a wonderful story and so well presented.
Excellent, thank you. I have often wondered what became of him.
My great grandfather served in the Crimea where trouble strikes it again after all this time .  Almost ended up being brought up as South African if he had decided to emigrate .  But stayed in the Midlands and even later in life rescued his grand daughter my late mother when during the Second World War .  My mother and great grandfather were strafed by a German messerschmitt who had been attacking Coventry that day.
I have used clips of the video in my training of leaders within an emergency response organisation. In summary, the junior leaders combat the current battle, while the officers anticipate and plan for the future evolution of the conflict. It always was well received by the students.
Please look at the conduct of the British Army during the Great War. Did Blackadder nail it? Were they Lions Led By Donkeys? Or was there nothing else Haig could have done given the circumstances? Why was he never replaced? Why was Haig revered by his troops when he died in 1928? My grandfather was at Ypres. He went to his grave with German shrapnel in his hip. Gas damaged his lungs and the Great Smog did for him in 1961, I believe. Visiting Sanctuary Wood and Passchendaele, I wonder why we held on there when the Bosch seemed to hold all the high ground.
A guy who lived in my house fought in roakes drift Mr Thomas Chester lived in South wales  in a village called Blaenllechau  in ferndale Rhondda  by Stanley Baker.
why us.because your hear lad.
fire at will ? er. which one will.?
Awesome 👍🏻
Thank you, as your asking. My grandfather a Pole came to Britain from western France 1 month after Dunkirk  it never gets the press that it deserves because it was a northern evacuation. I wonder if that is a subject worthy of your look. Operation Ariel is the name and it was an outstanding piece of organisation.
Hi Chris. I live in Hanley Swan, Worcester. For over thirty five years I have been a military historian and now, at the ripe old age of seventy six, am still visiting battlefields and writing articles and books. Would love to arrange a meet-up sometime to discuss
Delightful story telling!!! Paul Harvey would be jealous!
Mangosuthu Buthelezi or 'Chief Buthelezi'    played  Zulu King Cetshwayo kaMpande, his great-grandfather. Chief Buthelezi went on to form the Inkatha Freedom Party in 1975 and while he continued to act, had a long political career in South Africa.
I only seen a few segments since. But the whole Movie was truly worth it.    Thanks for this update. Fix Bayonets...hand Salute, Vietnam Vet, Marines.
"Well my father you see, ee loved the psalms y'know" 'eer nobody told you to stop workin" ".
One  of my favourite all time movies still love it😀great documentary thank for history lesson
Excellent video…
He made it through WWII as well. . . Not serving, but damn. Not surprised he turned down the VC. Probably more reason for him to get it. You know the real good ones don't think they deserve a medal like that. Badass.   Also, this is why you don't mess about with short people. We will ruin your ENTIRE day.
Been there three times.
What a legend
Frank, we salute you.
The kid.great
What a badass , he was a man's man..
Thought he ended up in a board game?
Best quote “officer on parade lad, officer on parade”
Terrific, just Terrific.
Come along now sir, there’s a good gentleman.
Great video. Subscribed!. Favourite quote has to be. " Hitch, Hitch, I saw you. You're alive. "
In the movie he was the perfect portrayal of a British Army NCO in the Victorian era for Great Britain.
Well, that had me riveted from start to finish. Fascinating story very well told. I think i'll subscribe and see what else you can inform me of, 👍
There was a scene where he told one of the men to button up his tunic.
"The gentleman has a bottle.........Sir"
So if he was based in Dublin from 1914, I would love to know if he was there in easter 1916. Can anyone tell me?
No one told you to stop working
Well done a most interesting presentation thankfully devoid of political comment. Just letting people know what actually happened.
" Hitch ! Hitch your alive I saw you " " I am ? Well, thank you".
Hope he taught them to fire 3 rounds a minute
I thought he was awarded the VC but had the option to trade up,for a majorship, which he took. An ex military colleague recently restored his grave.
"Aaaalright then, nobody told you to stop working"
Brilliant.
Thank you for a great video as l always wondered what happened to this chap 👍
They know my voice when they 'ear it
Blimey! What a remarkable military career. Lived to see England fight a SECOND World War. Right then! Bloody good show.. 🇬🇧💥
i used to go past a big office block in Beckenham named Bourne house . now I know why . thanks
Thanks for this chap.
Yes, I did enjoy that!
"Hitch..!  Hitch I saw you, you're alive."   "I am..?  Oh, thanks very much!"
The Union of South Africa awarded (Used to award??) The John Chard Medal in Bronze for 12 years service and the John Chard Decoration in Silver for 20 years service, to all ranks. Recipient's may use the the letters "JCD" appended to their name.
You haven't mentioned the Welsh troops involved in this conflict,  as the English never do, same as the battle of Argencour won by Welsh longbow men, without them that battle wouldn't have been won.
What a legend!
Wow 🤩 absolutely fascinating video!  You sir have a new subscriber
Thank you for sharing his fascinating life and the connection with British military history in the 19th and 20th centuries.
"Jones! ..Jones you're alive, I've seen you "
Filmed entirely in Wales !
What a life, thanks.
CSgt Bourne is the standard to which any British man should aspire to.
As for Bourne being the son of a farm labourer, but despite this was literate, a surprising number of 19th century farm labourers were literate ... more so than lower class city dwellers  Their work was seasonal and they had time on their hands when not working to educate themselves.
Well carry on with your mud pies .Chin Chin.
Like many, I was very taken with Nigel Greene's performance and his absolute personification of the Colour Sergeant. What I most remember about it was a scene in which he bayonets a Zulu warrior and does it absolutely by the book - as you would expect from his character: thrust, twist, withdraw. he did it with no sign of fear or triumph, just doing with some distaste as was expected of him. As an aside, my mother and auntie went to the Royal Soldiers Daughters' school in Hampstead in the 1930s where they were classmates with Henry Hook's granddaughter. One other thing I will say is this. When I was an apprentice on the railways in the early-mid seventies I came into contact with an Scottish RSM, who like Bourne was a mere 5' 3". Frankly, the height didn't come into the equation. He was barrel chested, stood bolt upright and scared the daylights out of everyone. First thing he ever said to me was, 'What are you doing here laddy? Clear off.' I was actually there because I was meant to be there, but I went anyway.
For Zulu lovers: here is a link to the “Zulu Official” Channel - https://youtu.be/PCuJyG8A7E4
Amazing man
They don't like it up em
He even outlived hitler  What a ledge
Nice to here ,a positive look on  British soldiers.and remember they didn't get any wealth out of it,that's why  you shouldn't tar every body with the same brush.
Lovely very informative video production. This information about colour Sgt Bourne just goes to prove how tv films distort our perception of events or personalities of particularly history. I'm and never have been a military man having tried to enlist I was told in the 1970s I was quite short at 5ft 5ins but they could fit me in !!!! I think it rather dented my confidence however most Tommy's in Victorian edwardian army were very small 5ft 5ins being normal height!!! There was the first world war bantam regiments comprising men even shorter who won more vcs than most other regiments. Similarly gladiators have been portrayed as tall muscular when infact they were on average 5ft 6ins and chubby due to a special bean and barley diet. The extra fat it produces sustained them from deep sword cuts. I digress but sometimes popular media distortion adds to a wrong imagery. British army uniforms were probably mostly filthy lice infested and the pith helmets in zulu wars were not pure white but stained brown with tea also the white cross belted equipment was of dark brown the slade Wallace type. Altogether a different image to the 1966 film zulu. Loved this production and ps I'm glad I'm a military history enthusiast only and model soldier collector researcher rather than having been a soldier myself. I prefer my creature comforts🙂 but pay homage and respect to those who have served and endured privation and death ultimately.
Britain had developed this zen-like appetite for trying to colonize countries they had NO business being in...sometimes the locals took exception to that and developed a real attitude...And sometimes it got British troops absolutely slaughtered....
Would like to hear The Dam buster story of Robert Guy Gibson as being named after him by my father who was in service in the war.
Brilliant story we'll told
Great stuff!
Brilliant thank you
What a fantastic piece and what an amazing person Frank Bourne was
it was as a young man that i discovered rourke,s drift through a serial magazine of the time and became fascinated with the subject when i first seen zulu i was transformed.And can remember all of the regional accents and can repeat many of the lines of by heart i have just been awakened again by the surge of a mixture of pride and sadness for the passing of such a time.
"Alright, nobody told you to stop working."
"He breaketh the bow and snappeth the spear asunder"
LAD.
Hi. Frank Bourne was a great soldier. Also, it was fantastic how he was able to climb the social ladder in Victorian Britain.  A bit of trivia - was Jason Bourne named in honour of him? Interesting. Let's discuss. Who else to discuss - Lionel 'Buster' Crabb. Would this be possible? Topical at the moment, with tensions over Russia.
Him taking roll. "You're alive I saw you." "Oh, thank you very much." " No comedians please."
"heroes" I always root for the Zulu
Thank you for the excellent piece. God bless the memory of Sgt Bourne
This is fantastic thank you for putting it together.
Just discovered your channel with this video. Very enjoyable watch, looking forward to seeing some of your other productions.
"Mr. Witt Sir!  Be Quiet now, will you!  There's a good gentlemen.  You'll upset the lads!"
This was a great insight about Frank Bourne..what a terrific guy he was and brilliant soldier..I remember seeing the film with the memorable performance from the late Nigel Green!
That was very interesting and informative, he might even have instructed my grandfather in the first world war to become a marksman, I will have to look into that.
Not sure if this is word perfect but CSM Bourne said without wavering: "Zulus to the south Sir.....Thousands Of 'Em"
FANTASTIC. Thank you so much for this video.
"I know you're 'ere, I've seen you"
That was great to see and hear thank you and thumbs up.
Well presented & extremely interesting
Great information.  Subscribed and rang the bell. Look forward to more.
Hi History Chap-  Could you cover what happened to Chelmsford and his company when they went into Isandlwana after the attack?  I know they camped there, why did they not head to Rorke's drift?  Did they run into the Zulu's leaving Rorke's drift?
Thank you I always wanted to know.
Fascinating! Thank you.
Allllllll right then......nobody told you to stop working.....
I wonder how much history the BBC has "disappeared "
That soldier was HARD CORP
Frank Bourne was my Grandfather's uncle who was also born in Balcombe- he was actually offered the Victoria Cross but did not accept it as it would have meant the end of his army career.
Now you can see where the BLM and the other idiot Left wing radicals got their ideas from .
This gave me goosebumps. A true British hero.
Colour Sergeant Bourne was quite a man.
Having visited the Rorkes drift battle site I agree fully with what he had to say in the interview regarding Zulu marksmanship, the hill behind where the Zulus were shooting down from is very close and it would be very easy to pick off men with no problem at that range. Good story .
What a fascinating and amazing video.  What an amazing man.
No comedians please
Great story. How about some videos about the great Naval explorers of the Royal Navy. Often forgotten in their homeland, but still revered in the British Colonies. How about the Great Capt. Matthew Flinders, whose surveying and navigations added to the establishment, by British Parliament Act, of the "South Australian Company", which was a move instigated by the British/French war, to expand the Empire...and not let those French blighters expand.   Here is a little lesson to get you started. Look forward to it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em34Gux0-bk
I'd like to see a video on "Fighting Jack Churchill" . A complete nut job of WWII who went into battle with bagpipes and a broad sword.
"Do your tunic up lad. Where do you think you are?"
"Zulu". . . despite the film's historical (and other) moderate inaccuracies, it is nevertheless one of my very favourite movies, second only to "A Bridge Too Far". Just an outstanding film. I was privileged to visit the headquarters of the British Army's successor to that regiment back in the 1980s for a planning session of the Cambrian Patrol Competition.
Great video, thanks for posting.
Outstanding most Informative It’s called a Sergeant to Lieutenant-Colonel his wage is a colour sergeant was 6p a week I’ve got three cents will be adapted for meals and washing At5’3”  ,
One of my all time favorite films, but remember the reality, The English against London's orders, started this war against the Zulu!  And at the end of the battle of Rorke's drift, the red coats bayoneted to death all the wounded, Zulus warriors, that could not get away!
i've never read of a colour sergeant in any other context, is it the equivalent of a sergeant major, and when did that rank die out?
Never underestimate the Engineers! One of my favorite movies as a kid, even Zulu Dawn. Cheers from America.  US ARMY SAPPER
The striped medal his character in the movie is wearing is the Military Medal, awarded to non-commissioned ranks. It wasn't created until 1916, so didn't exist at the time of Rorkes Drift
I first saw this movie as wee lad of 3 or 4. But when I saw it at the good will store on VHS, I watched it many times over. Wore out my player
Physical size in war is immaterial. The skill to use what has been learned and used in battle is important. In my experience men that can fight in civvy streets often become fearful when faced with a true fight in battle and become cowards.
Thank you.
Great video Chris . Love your channel. Could you please do a video on the New Zealand Wars
With his career, you would need a large man to play the role to symbolize all that the real Frank Bourne did. Great video!
I see you Hook!
What's that shooting colour Sargent  ?.....A RIFLE HUGHES
I've been fascinated with this campaign since I was a kid in the seventies its such an interesting period of british military history I would have loved to have travelled to  natal where t his happened great video 👍oh and do your tunic up where do you think you are lad 😄
"Say Sir, Officer on Parade"
What a very interesting video. I certainly leaned a lot this evening. Well done and thanks.
Great documentary about a really brave man. Extremely well presented and very interesting.
Yes as an aside what happened to Private Hook VC?🧐🤔
Thanks so much for this inspiring and moving tribute to a really humble man and brave warrior.
Pegasus Bridge would be a great story to know the truth about. I under stand Richard Todd the actor was a sergeant at the battle.
I stumbled upon this video by accident, and it's great. But... is that Pershore??
If you showed that on telly now they'd be a right stink from the woke brigade who want they're history swept under the carpet.
have you ever heard the story of a Royal Navy vessel passing an Italian Navy vessel is WW2 in neutral water - where the RN crew impressed the jeering Italian crew with disciplined passing honours? [it may well be a myth]
tHEThe way things are going this movie will probably be banned someday as an expression of white chauvinism....
Please do a video about the travails (which were not that great as their reputation preceded them) about the Ghurkas in the Falklands.
What a wonderful indictment of the supreme bravery of those at Rorkes Drift. Your information on Colour Sergeant Bournes service to his country, and his subsequent promotions give us a real insight into his obvious quality as a serviceman. What a life he led!
Great Video 👍. You Brits have a Fantastic History for sure.
The story of the action on Beziers Ridge on D-Day, when 21st Panzer was stopped in its tracks by a Battalion of 6pdr anti-tank gunners, should be told.
seen the firm a number of time and as a child my dad told me about his  visited to the battle fields in the 1950s and camping at Rorkes Drift when working in the area so I had to make the trip as  well, he had a great respect for the Zulu and all ways said the firm was just Hollywood getting it only part right. If you can get the cd set "Day of the dead moon" by David Rattray, if you have an interest in the Zulu wars well worth it.
My Great Grandfather.. Llewellyn Jones  Fought that day.
👍👍👍
Incredible that he lived so long!
Great story, and well told!
Bourne's moustache and sideburns were called Burnsides, named after the US army general of the same name who had fought for the North in the civil war. When men stopped growing the moustache but kept the rest then the name was reversed and they became sideburns.  Stanley Baker owned Chard's original Victoria Cross, though he did not know that at the time. And, of course, he should have worn a blue coat being an engineer.  At the end of the film Michael Caine, playing Bromhead, tells Baker's Chard that he had not fought a battle before. This was not true as he already had combat experience.
Zulu sir thousands of em ..... very interesting . What a career he had . Well presented well done .
Fascinating, thanks for this epilogue to the famous story
A good story  about a brave  man thanks  for telling  it
“Alright then, nobody told you to stop working!”
My mothers family were Clan Gunn and her father went to South Africa to fight in the Boer War and remained in South Africa as both a Soldier and Colonial Administrator - He commanded a battalion of the Kings African Rifles recruited from Zulus in both WW1 fighting in both German East Africa and Germand South West Africa (now Namibia) against the Germans under Lettow Von Vorbeck and in Burma fighting the Japanese in WW2.     He had a farm on the west bank of the River Tugela opposite Zulu Land near where the Buffalo River (forded at Rorkes Drift) joined the Tugela River - The farm workers were the families of fallen Zulu Askaris from his battalion and his former Askaris and their families  by Zulu.     My mother grew up speaking both the Zulu language known as isiZulu and Xhosa.  I never knew my mothers parents as they dies before I was born BUT remember my mothers stories of growing up on the High Veldt and the family dogs, Rhodesian Ridgebacks trained to protect the family from predatory Lions and swimming in the River Tugela as children with her 2 brothers taking it in turns to sit on a rock with a high power rifle to shoot any predatory crocodiles !!!!     There were many stories lion kills on the house veranda, elephants stampeding through the house and stories of the Zulu farm workers and children including a graphic story of children scrabbling for dry wood to eat the termites from the wood and using their fingers to push termites crawling out of their mouths back into their mouths - Termites being a valued high protein snack!!  Of importance to this post is the fact my mothers father was a very strict military man and he always praised the Zulus he commanded in both world wars as the best soldiers he had ever fought with or commanded and the only soldiers fighting for the crown against the Germans in southern Africa that could out march and out fight the German army comprising 1000 Germans and 10,000 Askaris.      I assume that also applied to the previous generation of Zulus from the Zulu War who could run 40 miles to a battle and fight a battle when they got there!       A factor that meant once battle was joined only cavalry and mounted infantry could escape meaning any British or Boer force fighting the Zulus had to stand their ground and win as at Rorkes Drift where the soldiers had open ammunition cases unlimited ammunition or die as they did at Isandlwana when they ran out of ammunition because the ammunition was being fired faster than the ammunition case lids could be unscrewed and distributed.  From the comments my grandfather made I am sure they were the equal of the Gurkhas surprised the Army didn't recruit Zulu battalions like it recruited Gurkhas.
The battle scenes were not very realistic!
I saw Zulu in 1964 at the Odeon cinema in Southend-on-Sea High Street and even now can recall thinking that it was a film that would remain in my mind forever.  It was not just the story, which of course I realised then that it might not be totally accurate, but it was actually the film itself, the situation, the colours, the people, the interactions between characters like Chard and Bromhead where they fought to establish their seniority, that were so well written and directed and performed. Ten years later I was in South Africa in 1974, married, and discovered the bravery and toughness of the magnificent Zulu nation, where I employed them for their loyalty and strength of purpose and mind, with other tribes deferring to them always.  I think the film showed both sides well and was very respectful to the Zulu nation, and for me, the most haunting thing of all was when they withdrew their men and their assegais, with the sound of their chanting as a sign of respect to the people who defended Rorke's Drift just fading into the distance.  I have a vast collection of dvds, many quite superb and memorable, but which one do I watch time and again to see what I might have missed from the film over those almost sixty years!  Thank you Cy, and congratulations.
Me and my Dad always wondered why he did'nt get a mention at the end of Zulu for a decoration,now we know ,great vid ,well done :)
What a life
Absolutely brilliant Chris. I did a lecture around 5 years ago on the Martini Henry 577X450 and it’s failings in the battle of Isandlwana. I wish I had this information. Well done.
The Zulus were hard as nails! Imagine how hot it was in that tunic!
The Zulus were hard as nails!
Staunch ... no other word really 🇬🇧
VERY enjoyable , thank you.but OBE? ORDER of the British Empire??? . It is OFFICER of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, easy mistake to make. (Member, Officer, Commander)
Brilliant!!  For the past thirty years, I've made it a point to view "Zulu" on a semi-annual basis.  The Battle of Rorke's Drift is an amazing story of military discipline & survival.
That was very interesting, thanks.
Excellent true life story of a real man.
Late to the party as usual.  Great line during roll call. 'Hitch!.....Hitch! Your alive lad, I've seen you'.
A tiger in Africa??
stumbled upon this channel . enjoyed the concise no nonsense narrative .subscribed
The BBC communist filth binned the interview deliberately. Like thousands of others.
A huge fan of the movie Zulu myself, thank you so much for this video and wonderful content.
Because we're here, lad. It's just Us...
"Say Sir, Officer on parade", during the role call after the battle. Whatever the circumstances, military protocol must be followed. Priceless.
In actuality Chelmsford was a cuck, who ran to the queen to cover his bollocks. He failed and ran away. A true coward,in EVERY sense of the word
My great grandfather was a senior NCO in the South Wales Borderers at around the same time and he too rose from being a private solider to a commissioned officer. I have a photo of him bolt upright with a waxed moustache. He was also not particularly tall. What characters they were. Mens men. A fantastic example of discipline, toughness, courage and duty. My Great grandfather went on to serve at Gallipoli. And he survived.
Hero
Maybe a history of american units that served in the British army during the American revolution.
Allright nobody told you to quit working.
'be quiet now sir... There's a good gentleman...'
very informative thank you
Good to know the Colour Sgt Bourne was as impressive as Nigel Greens Mutton Chop moustache. What a life he led.
Loved this, thanks so much for the upload👍
He hung on til victory in WWII, then it was "Peace out!" Now that was a soldier for life
Great video and channel.
"For the sake of Peter lad!  Wipe your bum."
Fantastic, thank you.
Fantastic story
According to my uncle , (Anthony John Rouse ) who did genealogy before the internet, I am related to John Rouse chard. My grandad fought in the battle for primosole bridge , with the DLI, I only now parts of the battle,as he never said much about the war,  So I'd like to see how that battle played out . Great video Many thanks.
I am still amazed at how ignorant, polarised and racist our society remains.  Not one word is ever mentioned about the courage and leadership of the African people when the lecherous British arrived on African shores.  With all your books, movies and documentaries, you remain ignorant.  🤨🤔
Interesting Facts: The Zulus themselves were invaders from the Congo who killed and ate the local Hotentot people.
Discipline and Bravery, unfortunately the actions of these men now scorned by many. A great video I knew nothing about him until seeing this.
Coloniser.
That was really good.Family history is one of my passions.Do you know anything about the 99th Regiment of foot.They were in South Africa at the same time.My 4 x Great Grandfather John Hunt was a private stationed in South Africa at the time. Thank you
Walked from isandlawana to Rorkes drift many times. Fantastic museum there.
if you go to brecon there is a museum there and a plack in the cathedrel
Good to see he ended up with a good life, the back bone
"Nobody told you to stop working."  My favorite quote from the movie.
The boy did good.
done that that idiot a clack / slap , and with feelining
We salute you Lieutenant-Colonel Frank Edward Bourne.⚔
Wonderful story, I enjoyed it very much  BTW there is a very interesting advanced USMC training manual, available to all, about that famous river crossing defense. Defense of Duffer's Drift (FMFRP 12-33). and how the way of the battle in the story was not the best defense possible.  www.trngcmd.marines.mil/Portals/207/Docs/TBS/FMFRP%2012-33%20The%20Defense%20of%20Duffer's%20Drift.pdf?ver=2015-02-27-135608-183
Just an idea for the future. I have an exquisite Chinese carved stone statue from the Imperial Summer Palace, Peking. The family story goes that it was removed from the palace, before it was burnt down ca 1860, being just the right size to fit in a soldier's nap-sack. It passed from my great-great uncle (called Middleton), to his brother (a colour sergeant in the Grenadier Guards, Tower of London), then down the line to me. Would it be possible to do a video on the events around the destruction of the summer palace, and which British regiments were involved etc.
Yeah rifles against spears. killing the local people and then calling themselves heroes.
No comedianes please
Your alive lad I've seen you.
Bring your rifles around to bare on the hill, fire at the smoke
Just think. If we hadn't invaded Africa nobody would have been killed.
GOD SHAVE THE QUEEN & AND PRINCE HARRY
If you get a chance try and find the original making of Zulu movie, it’s really good but the locals they had as extras really made the dying scenes as dramatic as possible lol
Excellent video thanks,  my favourite saying is when he is taking  roll call  and he replied  'Say sir officer on parade "..
A favourite comment which causes me some amusement as well as seeing a wonderful soldier and father figure. There is the moment when they are mounting the parapets ready for action and he tells a young soldier to do up a button on his tunic “ Where do you think you are?
And a bayonet sir!
loved the film ...classic line do your tunic up where do you think you are ...to a scared young solider lol
No mention of the BRAVE BOERS/Afrikaaners and the shameful treatment of the British towards them (Whitewashed history of the tyrants), just ignore the British concerntration camps set up for BOER WOMEN & CHILDREN!
Nigel Green - one of the best actors we ever had and grossly under-recognised.
What an excellent presentation, highly informative, well delivered and the use of backdrops and photo's added to the imagery. Well delivered Sir, you have another Subscriber!.   BTW, I spent my teens growing up in Brecon, home of the SWB 24th and a close friend's father was on security in the Regimental Museum. This meant that we were occasionally given access to the weapons room, which was not in later years open to the public. This was a great shame as it held many unusual and interesting artefacts. I wonder what has happened to them now the Barracks in Brecon has closed?
Eye watering. When men were men and Values didn't come cheap. Thank you
"alright then no one told you to stop working"
Great historic story about the life of a Great Soldier
Nigel green made the film in my opinion he’s was brilliant
Fantastic video. 👍
"Running to fight a battle, there's daft for you"
Only reason we went on holiday. Great stay in the hotel and the battle field tour of both battles was amazing.
And a bayonet with some guts behind it.

i loved watching the movie zulu but i liked it when he recited the prayer to the Reverend will ordering men to collect grain sacks
An incredible individual matched only by his service history.
I tough that everyone at Rorke's Drift that fought as if it were kill or be killed.  Had a history teacher say one time if the Zulu was a modern army at the time the British would have lost more men then they had at the time..
'The sentries report Zulus to the South-West......thousands of 'em!'  (Stanley Baker) 'Alright Colour- Sergeant, stand to!'
Zulu is the Greatest movie ever made, not only do you get a action movie you get a bit of documentary too
Hughes asks " What's that shooting"? The reply was "It's a rifle Hughes."
Yes Sir, the gentleman has a bottle. Stands out for me.
Color Sergeant Bourne was my favorite character in the movie, his stoicism and stiff upper lip demeanour was exactly what you'd want in a man in that position. I always wondered why he was not awarded the VC, thought it an injustice, but after seeing this video, feel much better about it. It's wonderful he lived to see the end of WW2. And blast that BBC idiot who threw out his radio interview! Not historically significant!!!?
I'm into my 70's now and have watched Zulu many times, I have the film on DVD and it sits with others which I consdider all time greats to be viewed as and when. Zulu is one of those films which reflects the social distinctions and attitudes of the time, the bravery and unswerving loyalty to the flag of the British Tommy. When Ivor Emmanuel the Welsh tenor starts and then leads his comrades with Men of Harlech I get a tear in my eye and a lump in my throat every single time, guaranteed.
Well done, Sir! Bravo! 👏🇬🇧
Alright then!..........Nobody told you to stop working!
He was just a soilder doing what needed to be done.. a humble man who lead by example.  We have much to learn from him
Brilliant , such a moving story .R.I.P  Frank Bourne
Hang on, I'll just ask my great grandfather. He was there too.
Great actor (Green), great film.  Well worth a visit to the London Imperial War Museum, which has the world's largest collection of VCs -including, from memory, two won at Rorke's Drift.
HOOYAH COLOUR SERGEANT!!! I first watched Zulu when I was 8 or 9 years old. So many in my family had been Non-Coms and I aspired to be the best Non-Com I could. Colour Sergeant Bourne was one of my inspirations. He was steady, inspiring, looked out for the men in his charge (and the junior officers). To this day I look out for the junior troops in my sphere and do my very best to arm them with the knowledge and tools they will need that day it all goes sideways. Unfortunately, and I am not tooting my own horn, there are fewer and fewer that realize that without those junior men and women? Our stripes are just pretty decorations. Fewer and fewer are those in the commissioned ranks that truly care for their troops. Too busy trying to climb that ladder. Too many cowards. God bless the professional NCO. The backbone of every unit there is and ever was. Nothing quite as terrifying as a NCO who knows what they're about, and no one else you'd rather have with you when the dying starts.
Back when the British Army was a real fighting force, unlike today's Pongoes... I think it's great that medals like the  VC are not handed out very often, unlike the Americans and Russians and especially the NRK, who seem to hand out medals for anything.
The Very Reason Why...The British Soldier is The Best in The World. Our Navy, The Finest.  Our Air Force.  The Most courageous.  We who live upon this island are indeed a lucky lot.  Those who are British can rely upon the dignity fortitude and true guts of every Man and Woman who wears, The Queens Uniform. And for that. Let us  with all our Heart  Give our Thanks. James "Taff" Kerby. Bargoed. Wales. The United Kingdom 🇬🇧  Proud to have served in The Royal Corps of Transport.                         🇬🇧
They don't make men like this anymore, I'm sorry to say.  Salute, LTC Bourne. RIP
Exceptional storytelling and absolutely fascinating.
Amazing man. For God and England, No Surrender
Hitch... Hitch, I saw you your alive
I was raised in South Africa, and have found lead slugs at Rorks drifft they still can be found to this day.
Fantastic narrative.  Zulu is my all time favourite movie even today.  It was powerful without the gore of todays films yet conveying a number of strong messages and lessons. Bourne was my favourite character in the film and it was great to read the after story to Roukes drift.  My father being a commissioned officer and myself a senior sergeant policing in Australia both with para military backgrounds loved the roll call scene where he calls out Hicks who doesn’t respond “Hicks your alive, l saw you!” Lol lol even all these years my dad and l still joke using this line at appropriate times…. Lol lol   Thank you again for doing a great job. :)
Reading up on the Indian Mutiny of 1857 I have been amazed at the bravery shown by British soldiers in that conflict , the odds never in their favour yet somehow they stopped the mutiny. The names are too great to mention and their capacity for prevailing against impossible odds outnumbered sometimes by 40 to 1 , less guns , less cavalry fighting a foe schooled in their methods . Outram, Hodson , Hope, Havelock and Campbell spring to mind but many of the junior officers were brave beyond belief . Their stories deserve to be told but are so fantastical may not be believed .
They all should have got the vc at rourkes drift even posthumously it is the most awarded for one action but that happened because of the massacre at isandlwana the government were trying to deflect a crushing defeat
Why don't they show the film on TV anymore, or will that be seen as racist,  you know how  pathetic and devoid of common sense these censors are these days!!!
The men were pawns in the evil called the British Empire ..... I see no honour in the invasion and slaughter of innocent people by those motivated by greed to steal their homeland !
Great movie and anyone who passed through 2RTB in Wagga knows it well as it was played the night before the final Challenge as a means to inspire us recruits. All i have no doubt have seen it many times and never tire of the great actors especially the portrayal of Colour Sergeant Bourne.
Thanks for this.
I remember watching the film a couple of times in school.
Why was Colour Sgt Bourne wearing the Ashanti Medal 1873-74 Coomassie? My Grt Gfather and his brother were in this campaign and I possess both medals. I really enjoyed your well researched video.
Love this movie. Have a DVD of it . Even bought a Martini- Henry rifle to play with. The movie's theme was powerful!.
"Alright then nobody told you to stop working"
"We're 'ere lad, just us. No one else"
The MEN described in these videos are definitely NOT woke!! Most of our serving forces are pretty decent too. Its the leaders of our society who have become so corrupt.
This was an amazing piece of information, thank you. I especially liked the part where you mention in the radio interview he admired the Zulu Warriors,  this is important, after all Britain were the invaders and the ZULU were defending their lands.
"Slovenly soldier"
Fantastic bit of history, what a guy.
Superb presentation, thankyou.
Chard lived near my house
Now that was a fantastic story. He was even a much bigger character in history than they made him out to be in the film.
Excellent video...thank you.
Aaaaalllright then! Nobody told you to stop working…
He got married and had a child Jason.
Not wishing to cavil, but the expression is 'mutton chop whiskers'.
An excellent presentation, full of detail and interesting facts. Think mainstream tv companies would do well to hire you to present military history programs.
many thanks for this top notch informative and interesting video.
new to your site but being Ex RN do you have any navy VC's i served with two holders of the GC so funny as both were ratings and being saluted by officers
shame the film show him in his true colours hight wise which would of asking more question
"Mr Witt Sir, Be quiet now will you there's a good gentleman, You'll upset the lads"
Thankyou for this video ! I ask my self could I would I be as brave under such circumstances?🇮🇳🇺🇸🇨🇦🇬🇧🇳🇿🙈🙉🙊🌍
Could help me find out about my Great Grand father’s father  of the Bengal artillery and Firemen, who I think died in 1857 and his son who had a long career leaving the Duke of York’s Orfinige for HM35. I think his son Robert Prichard Clayton Wilson earned the Good Conduct Medal plus other campaign medals in Burma and Africa and played the Fr. Horn at Masonic Funerals?
Absolutely fascinating story. Thank you for sharing.
"Zulus, to the south east, thousands of them."
Interesting to know: it was the British themselves who armed the Zulus with guns they didn't understand or knew how to use!.
The truth..Guns vs spears....nuff said, still zulu is a cool movie
Brilliant video. Great research!
Loved the movie.
If this was remade today, the zulu army would win. Otherwise it would be racist.
My favorite quote of his is when he quotes from Psalm 46 ("He makes the wars to cease, breaks the bow asunder" etc.)
"Time of need"... there was ZERO need for the first world war whatever. Other than Europe annihilating itself.
Hughes ! " Yes Colour Sargent " Say Sir, Officer on Parade.  "SIR !"
We have the honour of 3 of the survivors from Rourkes   Drift being buried in our local cemetery.
Jason Bourne's grandpappy there I would say. What a badass.
Fascinating. No idea about his career after Chelmsford's disaster. Glad he did well.
“Hitch? Hitch I saw you, you’re alive.”  “Oh I am? Thanks very much.”
With a bit of guts behind it
Happy to say I have been to the site of rorkes drift and isandlwana. 2 amazing sites for different reasons.
Now do up your tunic lad.
Duty Honor Country !
Check out the seige of jadoville about 150 Irish troops against 5000 in the Congo in 1961 .
Check out the seige of jadoville,about 150 Irish troops against 5000 katangan troops and French mercenaries, similar to this battle,it took place in the Congo in 1961 .
Fascinating. Thank you.
In 1967, I was detached from my regiment in Aden on a 3 month secondment in newly independent Botswana. It turned out the outfit I was seconded to was B Company, South Wales Borderers. And they remembered Rorkes Drift OK! There were days (especially after  few beers) when it seemed all you would hear was "11 VCs before breakfast". I swear I heard it so often it made my ears bleed! While in Botswana, the regiment decided it would be a grand day out for a party from the company to make a pilgrimage to Rorkes Drift (probably about 700 miles in Army Land Rovers and Bedford 3 tonners). On the way, they had to ford the Limpopo River; wide but shallow enough to ford. The CO called for a volunteer to walk ahead across the river to ensure they kept the convoy on the shallowest part. A Lance Corporal (pretty sure he was a Davies) volunteered. When they safely reached the other side, the CO called to Lance Corporal and said "Well done...do you know what that was?" No Sir. "It was the Limpopo River, and do you know what it is famous for?" No Sir. "It is famous for the biggest collection of crocodiles in southern Africa". L/Cpl reportedly fainted on the spot!
How nice to hear true history  of the British army battles well done Eric Cubbin
In the summer of 1984, at the age of 10, I watched "Zulu" so many times that I memorized the entire script.   My friends and I would recreate the battle in our backyards in Virginia with our fences as the breastworks.  The next summer dad brought home "Zulu Dawn" on VHS and I almost melted with excitement.  Several years later I saw "Khartourm" and was no less enthralled.  The Victorian Empire contributed so much to my childhood, lol.
he was the dialogue of the film, shown during my high school, some 40 odd years ago.
In a treelined road in Beckenham, Kent, there is a pleasant looking house with a blue plaque commemorating Colour Sergeant Bourne. Not forgotten.
Brilliant description history. As an ex National Service man, always proud to serve plus 18 years as a Reservist in British Army.
Very Interesting what a life. Your alive I saw you 😂😂😂😂😂
Wòuld you cover the case of Pilot Officer Percival Ross-Frames Burton,the Battle of Britain^s forgotten hero?
You admitted to mention that the 24th of foot was “at the time of the battle” the Warwickshire regiment - which allows Welshmen to continue to believing it was a Welsh regiment.
YOU'RE ALIVE, I'VE SEEN YOU.  Say Sir Officer on parade!  NOW TODDLE OFF TO SICK BAY WHERE YOU BELONG!
What a shining example to young men of today.  Unlike some of the nonesense they are currently exposed to.
When I was younger, Hook was my favourite character, however, over time, Sergeant Bourne became the character I grew to like the most.
I am a keen collector of mMilitaria, and one of my favourite items is a Martini Henry rifle.
The gentleman has a bottle.
Some real life stories of duty and courage just reduce me to tears. This was one of them. Thank you.
From Tennesse, USA...this was EXCELLENT.
Excellent and thankyou for the time and effort you have contributed.
I’ve always loved the Zulu film one of my army colleagues father was an actor and played an nco in the Zulu film ,
Frank Bourne: What a truly brilliant soldier. Private to Lt. Col., an amazing achievement given the period in which he served. At the time of Rorke's Drift, the 24th was also known as the 2nd Warwickshire Regiment of Foot. I've always considered it strange, that a regiment from my home county would become a Welsh regiment, given that Warwickshire has no border with Wales.
He was a very brave man. Also, a very short man.
Awesome video for a giant of a soldier.
Frank, the real Bourne identity.
Whether or not he should have received the Victoria Cross, he certainly went on to much greater things in real life. Thankfully, he was greatly honoured for his long illustrious service to his country.
My grandfathers brother was in the 24th batt lanc fusileers , captured by the japanese and died in a p.o.w camp and is buried in rangoon war cemetery, trying to find out what happened to the 24th but not much luck .
We were  made to  watch  this film  as part of our  training  before we  went to  Vietnam. Twice in fact.
Best line in the Film was when Soldier Hughes said "Colour Sgt Bourne what's that Firing " ??  " A Rifle Hughes"   😂🤣😆
Interesting to hear Bourne tried to re enlist in 1914, my grandfather’s brother James King Warden won the DCM at Colenzo in 1899 re enlisted in 1914 and offered his services again at the age of 61 in 1939 he was told “go home grandad and send your son along”. He died a month later.
"Colour Sergant ,would you give your report to the officer commanding  this camp ?".A look towards his own officer  who nods,(Bromhead))."Very  good sir Zulus to the South West ! ,Thousands of them !"
5'3"?  It just shows that it's not the man in the fight, it's the fight in the man.
I've watched the movie many times and each time and every time I wondered why he was never awarded the Victoria Cross.
Do that button up lad
Now that's Soldiering
"Alllllllright then, nobody told you to stop working!"
What a great example of a professional soldier and NCO.
All right Lads, nobody told you stop working
War is a crazy thing that takes life and gives life .my grans husband got shot by a German on the head and died .years later my gran remarried and then started a family my dad being their first that allowed me to have a shot at the old life game ...nuts if the German didn't have a good aim my ass would have been grass lol
" Mr Witt sir. Be quiet now will you? There`s a good Gentleman. You`ll upset the lads."     Love that line!!
Officer on parade
As a South African history of the wars I found very interesting, in the area we lived we found old 303 clips of live ammunition in the hills. So one evening my two brothers and myself decidedly test a round. We were siting on the bed and opened the window aimed up and pulled the trigger. I still remember saying that that was the sound the soldiers heard during the Boer war.
So the BBC were always a bit doolally tap then! A term this great man would of no doubt been familiar with and probably seen a lot of it.
speak up your alive i saw you this morning...not exact quote
Zulus sir. Thousands of them.
My Dad had a VHS box set about the Zulu Wars. It had a few minutes about Henry Hook, with a dramatisation of Hook reading his bible by candlelight
"I've seen you Hitch, you're alive"
Thank you, you have made this more issue more clear.
Good name
Surprised he did not get a rifle again in ww2.
Sounds about right, some plonker from the BBC dumped the interview! some things never change.
Brilliant film , and brilliant research and presentation here, i have heard people say -the British army shouldn't have been there - they were only moving the Zulus because of Gold!. That may or may not have been the case - but if you and 150 of your mates are suddenly surrounded by thousands of angry warriors - i don't think sympathising with their plight would do you much good!? Independant ! Fire at Will !   (That's very nice of 'im!)
"Officer on Parade -say Sir!"
Do you have a comment on the British Commandos that trained with captain Martin Linge’s Norwegian soldiers during WW2 My Father John Søreide was a young 17/18 Norwegian man in escaping the conscription into the German army in 1942. He helped out on the Shetland Bus Until being enlisted in the Norwegian Brigade. I know very little about the Norwegians but nothing about the Commandos.
Men like him and his comrades were the backbone of The British Empire. Their principles their stoicism they steadfastness in the face of adversity set the standards for future generations. Generations of British men and women that built on the foundations of honour respect devotion and camaraderie. Skip to modern Britain selfish uncaring  and materialistic and above all don't lift a finger..
Mmmmm, good example of the likes of Lord Kitchener's men who raped, plundered the boer families and homesteads as part of Britain's scortched earth policy.  Britain pioneered concentration camps..... not the Germans!!
Brill 👍🏻
Linekers sir......thousands of em
Excellent
Brilliant!
The final role count.  Answer "Sir", officer on parade.
“I saw you. You’re alive.”
Really interesting
Excellent presentation. Thank you.
"SENTRIES REPORT ZULUS TO THE SOUTH EAST SIR...FAAAARSANDS OF EM!"
A jolly good chap that looked after his men when it mattered ,shame he never received the cross ,short chaps have been known to be mighty
As some one who loves military history and who has ZULU down as one of my favourite movies. This was a great piece of historical information and good to see that a 5"3 chap held up his end , as I am 5"4 and was a tiny Jock , until I carried the log around part of the assault course at Pirbright many many moons ago. Great to see he had a long life and achieved DCM OBE and high ranking commission.  "your not dead lad, I can see you"....... Pause ....... "Oh thanks CS, "here!"
Died 1945 one day after VE Day….
"THEY DON'T LIKE IT UP 'EM...!"
What a life....puts some of us to shame
Zulu is a great film but terrible historical representation of reality. It destroys the reputation of a true hero, turns a VC awardee into a drunk coward. Ignores other heroes, tells the world that the regiment was Welsh, when it was an English regiment and just makes up half the battle.
Thank you for a very interesting and well researched video. All the best from Sydney Australia 🇦🇺
what an amazing life and accomplishments this man had...
I have a few characters in the Army for The History Guy to write new Youtube video essays for:  Brigadier Mike Calvert - a hero in the Burma campaign in WW2 - a thorn in the side of the Japanese if ever there was!  Lt Col A D Wintle - there already is a 4 part program about him on YouTube, copied from an old TV show Heroes and Villains, brilliantly played by Jim Broadbent. But I'd like to hear the true history.   Maj Gen Sir Percy Hobart - of Hobart's Funnies fame. He invented many unusual weapon systems for the British Army, particularly for use on D-Day in WW2. He may have been the original basis for the fictional Professor Branestawm.
Im a retired Aussie Infantry Sergeant Major ( Warrant Officer), who also commissioned to Captain at the tail end of my career and I remember fondly when I was joining the Army as a young bloke the movie Zulu was one of the recruiting movies. It was a favorite. And you are bloody right because Colour Sergeant Bourne was a fine example indeed. I love the history of this era and the great traditions of the British Infantry, a lot of which us Aussies inherited as well. Thanks for the great video's mate !
subscribed  this is really good what happened to his family did they leave india ??
i would like to hear about the charge of the light brigade' .    in the crimean war.   the stiff upper lip of the english is a beutifull thing.
Apparently the English are going to remake Rourke's Drift with Frank Bourne as a black man. This might sound crazy at first, but this process is already being done in Anglosphere period pieces and it makes a lot of sense considering the universalist nature of the English and the future of England.
What a character he was. Shame he didn't live for another 25 years in good health.
Great commentary and research. Awesome. I lived and work some 8 years in Africa. 6 in South Africa/Namibia. If you are ever there and have a few  weeks. The battlefields from the 1800s, the Anglo  - Boer Wars, Anglo - Zulu Wars, German  Herero Wars, Zulu Kingdom and the Ndwandwe tribe...brutal, and WWI in Namibia are mostly intact. Few know that some 90,000 (both sides) Union of South African / British Troops / Portuguese  fought the Germans in Namibia/SW Africa. First planes - Australian - were  used as observation planes in Namibia/South West African. Check out one of the National Museums in Swakopmund. Cheers
Isn't that typical of the BBC. Destroying the best of British culture.
“Quiet in the ranks, officer on parade”
"Button your tunic!"  "my God, has he eyes in the back of his head?"
Good vlog. I have seen Zulu half a dozen times. Now a Colour Sergeant in the British Army had a crown above the 3 stripes. My father was a Colour Sgt in Northamptonshire Regt, served 22 yrs Northamptonshire Regt/East Anglian Regt.  In the movie and pic above I saw no crown, just the three stripes.  Error by director or ill advised by technical director?  He should have got VC, but did well getting commissioned from the ranks.  I am in Australia now, but some years ago visited the SW Borderers museum in Brecon, highly recommended.
What happened to Cook???
i liked the criminal in the jail he got a VC
Excellent story.  Thanks!
From what I understand, I’m commissary Dalton, was the backbone of the Roark’s Drift defense. Dalton was an ex-NCO.
My Mrs moms great uncle or great great uncle was in that battle...surname HOOK...won VC apparently
Yes I am proud of my country, history and culture and Mr Bourne is one of the reasons why. God bless you sir.
Outstanding.
HOOK !  HOOK ! I know you're here, I've seen you !!!
That film was one of the reasons I joined up myself. As luck would have it, as a Sgt. I was attending a course and was billeted at a barracks in Aldershot, Buller Barracks. Where the resident RCT unit was the descendent of one of those  present at Rourke's Drift. They had Zulu impi spears and shields on the Sgt Mess wall, with portraits of medal recipients. Another lad on the course "Taffy"  was absolutely amazed because one of his family served during the battle!  I have photos stashed away somewhere. Could be worth a video on the YTube.  Buller Barracks is gone now and I hope the RLC still have those items on a mess wall somewhere.
Wow,born just down the road from where i am now,amazing
I would like to see the battle of Waterloo in particular the defence of hugemont farm by the Coldstream Guards and the exploits of Sgt Graham on that day / days!
'Why me Sergeant? Why me?' 'Cos we're here lad, we're here'.
Wow thanks for a great informative video really interesting and well put together, I Have visited the south wales borderes barracks and museum in brecon many times and the cathederal were the colors from rorkes drift are on display and it never fails to fascinate me look forward to more vids...pete...Spain.
Afghan wars Sir please.
No Comedians please......Officer on parade.
Do you know where abouts in Dublin he was based and between what dates?
"Do your tunic up man. Where do you think you are?"
Thank you for this excellent historical fact   I enjoyed it very much
A motivated and disciplined NCO corps is the backbone of any army. Frank Bourne is a fine example of just such a soldier!
What an amazing guy.  I had no idea he was around When Hitler bombed England.
Fantastic story! Sadly a Sainsburys now stands at the site of the old School of Musketry in Hythe but I shall remember colour Sergeant Frank Bourne next time I pull into that car park.
What a career.
Great stuff.  There were so many wars and battles the British fought in the nineteenth entry.  This one is known because of the film, but so many are not so well known.
“Say sir, Officer on parade.”
Nobody told you to stop working
The color sergeant is my personal hero too in this movie! History Chap your video cleared up a lot of questions I've asked myself over the decades. I'm glad that this humble hero had a storied life. I salute this magnificent soldier!
“Zulu’s to the SouthWest, thousands of ‘em”
A Sussex man  "we wun't be druv"
Steady lads
Colour  Sargent bourn what's that shooting " it's a rifle  huges"
I am a new subscriber, I love your channel. Have you done a video on Douglas Bader? He is one of my favorite aviators from the Battle of Britain.
The Canadian Forces use Zulu, specifically Bourne's words and actions, as a training film for officers.
I have my great grandfather’s certificate of musketry which he gained at Hythe in 1890.
I live very close to Philips park cemetery where private William Jones V.C is  buried a veteran of Rorkes drift...there is a house on Edge lane Clayton / Openshaw border with a blue plaque bearing his name
I have often said it is not the size of the package BUT the quality of the contents that matters. Color Sergeant Frank Bourne is a perfect example of that statement. The American  Army had a similar case with Lt. Audie L. Murphy. Some people just don't have it in them to give up in a fight.
Fascinating very well done. But again so much lose of life due to British militarism  back then. Not a snow flake  just adding some perspective.
Admirable men. Contemptible mission.
I don't know if it was true or not but I recall reading somewhere that, after Roarke's Drift, Sgt. Bourne was given the choice of a V.C. or a commission, and he opted for the commission.  Incidentally, not long after "Zulu", Michael Caine and Nigel Green appeared together in another film, "The Ipcress File", although portraying very different sorts of characters.  One thing I always wondered , not being British, exactly what is the difference in status in the British Army between a "Colour Sergeant" and a "Sergeant Major"?
Wow what an incredible life and career.Who would have thought it? Did the Zulus actually sing together in respect at the end of the battle of Rookes Drift as they did in the film? Lieutenant Bromhead( Micheal Caine) shouted at the Zulus because he thought it was a war cry to finish the British soldiers off.Interesting that the role of lieutenant Bromhead should have been played by Richard Burton,Cy Enfield's first choice but he was unavailable, thus an unknown actor Michael Caine got the part instead. Richard read the introduction to the film off-camera.
Very interesting, thank you
Where is he buried?
Mister Witt Sir, be quiet now, will you? There's a good gentleman. You'll upset the lads...........Pure Class !
Frank Bourne was an Englishman, and did his duty. Our current Army senior officers, and our politicians should do the same.
If you haven't already covered it I like to see something about Operations Manna and Chowhound
What a man...what a life. An amazing account which I really enjoyed.
What a remarkable, inspiring story, of a brave remarkable man.  Great video.
Three and a half pennies  *Thrupence ha'penny*
The channel BritishMuzzleloaders has covered the Zulu wars in-depth from a weaponry POV.
Nigel Green also played Michael Caine’s (temporary) boss in ‘The Ipcress File’.   Zulu turned Caine into a star overnight, so he was the lead in Ipcress just a year later.
A strange connection from real life to film and back again, there was a man in the Cane Hill mental hospital, Coulsdon,  who ended up there due to being traumatised at Rorkes Drift, he was a young kid hiding under some stuff when a Zulu pulled it back to find the young boy, the Zulu didn`t kill him but he had a break down years later and never left the hospital after it. In the same ward in the hospital was David Burchell, Michael Caine`s half brother.
Well done sir and god rest your soul.
Sorry, could anyone tell me what "Colour Sergent "does mean??
How wonderful! Thank you. The media bag
"Nobody told you to stop working!!!"
I have seen this movie several times and this character inspired me. Spain and England have many things "together". Heroes, wars, a lot of history together and against each other. Trafalgar, Cartagena de Indias. When  I go to England, I visit the Imperial war museum.
The movie , " Zulu " is in my top 3 movies of all time. Colour Sergeant Bourne was a particular favorite. The way he carried himself and instilled confidence in his men. Truly a remarkable man who served his Country with distinction. My late Grandfather John Eddington was a Warrant Officer in the Royal Engineers in WW1. My Grandfather was awarded the OBE, MBE and decorated by King George for Valor. In WW2 my Grandfather John served in MI6. I would love to know more about what he did. Alas I can't find much out as records for MI6 are classified. I am so impressed with the true story behind Colour Sergeant Bourne. How he tried to enlist for WW1 at 60 yrs old. That showed his devotion to his country. Once a warrior always a warrior. Bless you Major Lieutenant Kernel Bourne. 💪🏼
Hitch.........Hitch, youre alive, I saw you
Brilliant video, many thanks.  I don't mind admitting it actually brought a lump to my throat and a tear to my eye.
Have u done one on John Williams/fielding vc Aa he's from my home town and buried here
Wow he really should have a VC.
One of the top ten war movies of all time.  Unlike all the 'woke' and culturally sensitive movies of late, it has a total realistic focus on the British Army unit that made one of the most incredible stands in military history.  Historically accurate, and with stupendous acting by all the principals.  It is in my Blu-Ray collection and watched when I need inspiration.  One facet I particularly admired was when Lt. Chard, an engineer, and Lt. Bromhead, Infantry, compared dates of rank.  Chard was senior and Bromhead immediately deferred and supported him completely.  Not at all like a lot of subsequent history.
By far the biggest danger for british troops fighting in the 3rd world during the Victorian age where however the 'local' diseases with malaria being the no.1 threat...
The Anglo Afghanistan wars and the last man at Kandahar is a fascinating story, if you haven't covered it .
Steady lads...
An excellent video about an extraordinary man.  Thank you.  You ask for suggestions for new videos.  I have one but the information is so thin that the mission seems impossible, however, should you decide to accept it...  Over the years I have read many books on all manner of British SOE operations during WWII.  Some ten years back in two separate books* a group of upper class men was mentioned... one sentence in one and two sentences in the other book.  It was the dark days of 1940 and as I recall they decided to recruit, from the 'Ole Boy's network, a group of men that would operate against any Nazi occupiers.    This was mentioned in passing by the two authors as a spontaneous group that was so secret that it didn't have a name much less a membership roster.   I've never had any luck finding out more.  It would be delicious if you could do so.  *It was more than ten years ago and I have no idea of the titles of the books anymore.
5'3" and not 6'3" why let 12 inches get in the way of a great movie! Historical accuracy always suffers at the hands of screenwriters/casting directors. The 1997 TV movie "Rough Riders" General Joseph Wheeler was played by Gary Busey who is over six foot tall, The real Joe Wheeler barely made the height requirement to attend West Point and was built like a jockey.
Just as men standing there, and I've stood on that dusty plain. That would be a truly terrifying sight to see that mass of Zulu warriors, that was only a reserve of 3000-4000 part of their main force too diverted to Rorke's Drift, who had fought at Battle of Isandlwana (British defeat) for a full day, an Impi consisting of approximately 20,000 Zulu men.  At Rorke's Drift there were 139–141 British regular troops, 11 colonial, vs. 3000-4000 Zulu. So about 28+ enemy combatants to each British defender.
No comedians please
My favourite comment has to be "Yes Sir, the gentleman has a bottle"
Alllll righty then, no-one told you to stop working!!!!! Love the film, and a great video, was shocked to hear he didn't get the medal,, but he got even more after, Results speak for itself..
My favorite character was Hoocker.
"Mr. Witt sir, be quiet now, will you. There's a good gentleman. You'll upset the lads."
Thank you sir for a wonderful historic telling of the famed Color Sgt. of Company B.  I hope to catch more of the stories and videos you produce.  Thanks!  SammyC
Should have got a VC end of. "Patrol reports zulus to the southwest.... thousands of them"... need a pair against them guys.
Highly unlikely woke BBC, ITV will ever show this film again.......I wonder if we could travel in time today and bring them back, would they anhilate the BBC, Rotherham and other town white coercers to the rapes.
As Russia has just invaded Ukraine it's neighbour I wonder why did the Britain invade a land so far away.
Great story. Have you covered Harry Hook and his Rorke's Drift involvement? He was portrayed as a rogue in the film but was anything but in real life.
Surely the Zulu script was written with Nigel Greene in mind. He quietly stole every scene in which he had a line, much to the chagrin, I'm sure, of Michael and Stanley. Every line is a winner, but who can doubt that the ultimate utterance was just three words: "Button your tunic." That stoic sentiment probably best explains the entire history of the British Empire.
I purchased the movie
The 1st image of this video, my Dad has the print on his living g room wall, my Dad's favourite film.
What an inspiration . sometimes when I'm really thirsty I imagine those men who fought in Burma and in North Africa in ww2 ..and I think how lucky to just turn a tap on for cold water .little things like that I never forget our veterans regardless what period . Waterloo,Crimea,Zulu wars..boar war ,ww1.northwest frontier,ww2.korea.borneo Malaya aden.yemen,Ireland,Falklands.etc
Such an awesome movie, made to tell the story of a few awesome men.
You forgot to mention that the Zulus had nothing to eat for several days and had been running to Rorke's Drift (Washing of the Spears).
"There's a good gentleman."
That was awesome
The true warrior ideal. Service, training, and never bragging except to praise those around him. I imagine when he passed away it was with the relief that his beloved country and won the day.
Ted willobegh who gave Barns Wallace the idea of the bouncing bomb
The real C/Sgt Bourne was not as portrayed by Nigel Green in 'Zulu'. He was a young guy in his 20s. Retired as a Lt Colonel and I think died in 1941. Neither were most of soldiers Welsh. The Cardwell geographical reforms had yet  to work through. Most of the soldiers in 1879 still  came from the Midlands.
Top man , professional, humble and eye to his men.
Very interesting, well researched and  presented video. Thanks for sharing, subscribed and look forward to watching your other videos
When one of his soldiers was killed  reading the roll call lol he was a lovely baritone
I suppose Alexander was 5'3" of thereabouts so don't knock the little uns.
Amazing. Glad the Colour Sergeant had a well deserved long life. What a great soldier and only 5'3" but I do like the Nigel Green portrayal in the Zulu film, which is one of the finest war films ever made. My namesake won a VC at that battle!
Excellent bio of CSgt Bourne. What some might fail to realise is that during that period the CSgt was actually the company sarn’t major, warrant officer class two- (WO2) as he or indeed she is today...be only 24 holding that rank is an outstanding achievement. In the modern British army it takes around something like 15-18 odd years to reach that rank if you’re lucky.
My great  great grandfather was Anthony Clarke Boothe.
Excellent presentation and delivery. Just found your channel. Keep up the good work. As a suggestion maybe a piece on Horace Smith Dorian who was one of the few survivors of Islandwana and went on to play a key role in WW1 although not liked by Sir John French who had already had his day in the Boer war .He was past his sell by date in WW1. What if HSD had had Haigs job however ?😊
Great video. Thanks from my hill top in. Sc. USA
His real story, especially life after the Boer war, is even more impressive and inspiring
Color seargent BOURNE DESERVES A VICTORIA CROSS
I wish you had mentioned that it wasn't actually a welsh regiment that fought at Rorke's Drift but in part a Black Country regiment,none the less i really enjoyed your insight to the battle,and obviously the information about Colour Sergeant Bourne
What's that shooting cloursargent. Arifle.
When a Senior NCO is doing their job correctly, it is seen in the actions of their junior NCOs and soldiers.  Great Sr NCOs influence, mentor, train, and coach.  Good soldiering is just part of the job.
"Yes sir, the gentleman has a bottle" And "All right now! Nobody told you to stop working!"
Bro head finished up as a Major General!
How about the history of the Durham Light Infantry. Although I was born in Nottingham I think of myself as a native of Durham, as both parents were from County Durham. I have lived here for sixty-six years and I would love to hear this history of what I have become to know of a very renowned infantry division of the British Army.
in the movie didn't he say something like "zulu's sir... thousands of them"
Zulu is a great historical military film and The Battle of Rorke’s Drift one of the greatest defensive victories in history, especially after what happened at The Battle of Isandlwana. I just have one question. Why were sergeants in the British military called “colour” sergeants? And are they still called that today? I’m American, so pardon my lack of knowledge with this.
Chris, that was superb
Starts as a private, finishes as a Lt Col having made an indelible mark on history. What an incredible man!  Also, I now know who Lord Roberts is, his name adorns the shooting centre at Bisley where my club is. I always meant to look that one up.
Thanks for raising this mans reputation to one of dignity and courage that he so much deserved.. I agree that he did his duty and should not of receive the VC. The other medals were however very much deserved.
In post in Dublin during the Easter Rising. Some members of the School of Musketry in Dollymount (Dublin) get a write up for action. Would like to find out more about Bourne's time in Dublin.
One hell of a career & life
Thanks for that video. I'm so glad the movie got at least one character correct. As a former Sgt from the U.S. Army, I've always believed Colour Sergeant Bourne was a perfect example of an NCO. I'm happy to learn the real Frank Bourne went as far as Lt Col.
What a life he lived from the Zulu War through to World War 2.
my favourite quote is "Say 'Sir'... officer on parade" at the end.  They've just had several days of battle, and are doing a roll call after the battle.  The soldiers are bone weary and one soldier incorrectly responds with 'yes colour sergeant', and he corrects him with how to respond.  It's like, 'for crying out loud colour sergeant, give us a break' to which he would respond 'no'. :D   Incidentally, I agree that "Zulu" was what made me learn of the Zulu Wars, I am eternally disappointed with how they portrayed Hook.
Watching the role call at the end,seeing the hurt in his eyes as he struck another soldier from the list,watch the same sort of scene near the end of the dambusters in the k.i.a.quarters,so painful.
Have you investigated the Sandringham company who were lost at Gallipoli, I have a personal interest as my Great Uncle (Robert John Overman) was a member.
Hook, I saw you
Button up your tunic, where do you think you are man.
TRUST the British bullshit core to adjudicate that an interview with such a man was of no historic value....??? HAVE they ever been any different?    But thank you for such an excelent video and content.
I would love to hear about Sergeant Peter King and his “invasion “ of France as a dentist as told about in his book Amateur Commando and as told in the film Two Men went to War. He went on to be Lord Lovatts Sergeant Major on D Day
my first platoon Sgt in 1979 tommy lee, 2 company 1st battalion Irish guards was very much like frank Bourne, a real soldiers, soldier.
Excellent video, new subscriber here
Zulu is full of great one liners, many of them from Nigel Green. "Hitch I know you're alive, I've seen you", "The gentleman has a bottle", "Be quiet now there's a good gentleman you'll upset the lads". For me, the best was "Sentries report Zulus to the south-west, thousands of them", although It should have been "thousands of the blighters". How typical of the BBC to discard the only recording of CS Bourne's voice.
All righty then …….nobody said to stop working
G'day.  Not related to to the Boer war, but thought you may be interested.  The quote you included from C-SGT Bourne reminds me of one in the film "The Odd Angry Shot" (a 1979 film about fictional characters in the 92nd Wing Australian SAS in Vietnam) "You're here because you're here.... and everyone has to be somewhere... and you're here.... so you'd better bloody get used to it" I didn't serve with the SAS (I did serve in the Royal Australian Navy, including in the original gulf war with the Australian Clearance Diving Team), but my uncle (Dick "Brekky" M - Brekky, because he got into a fight with some US Green Berets, after saying 'I eat Green Berets for Breakfast" - I believe the final score was - Like most Hotspurs games, whom he LOVED - Nil all) served with the 92nd Wing Australian SAS-R (for 3 tours), and he said the film is a fabulous "compilation of the Aussie SAS experience in 'Nam". Long story short.. not sure if the film is worth a video - as it's really a representation, not real individuals - but for your own personal reasons, have a watch of "The Odd Angry Shot", just for entertainments' sake.  It's been a favourite of mine for decades. And for anyone else out there.. it's actually not a bad movie 😀 Thanks again, Chris
"Nobody told you to stop working!"
That was fabulous!!
“Zulus Sah, fahsands ov ‘em.”
In the main the British Army was divided into families otherwise known as battalions or regiments etc These soldiers who lived and shared the good with the bad were well known for their complaining natures about anything and everything in the British Army, but when the shit hit the fan those same men became a deadly organised killing machine to be feared by all who opposed them: The British Army was more at war with itself in peacetime than it was during any conflict. British soldiers became bored very easily in peacetime so when a conflict was rammed down their throats they went at it as only a brave and disciplined army should. There were odd times when a few did let the side down but they were truly ostracized by their mates. The British army compared to some is a small army but it is also a mighty army when roused:
Zulus sir thousands of them.
I Zulu [ the film] was mandatory viewing whilst doing recruit training in Australia in the '60s and 70's. I watched it twice during 12 weeks of training. and probably another 10-15 times since. It might not accurately represent what happened, but it's still a bloody good film. One of the reasons so many VC's were awarded was to take away the impact of the Islandawana defeat 2 days before.  Colour Seargent Bourne to my mind was/is the epitome of a bloody good NCO.
men like this are the reason empires exist dam good
Thank you for informative history of Frank Bourne,
Great insight about the "Mealy" Bags as I wondered exactly the same thing!
Color Sergeant Bourne: “Yes, sir. The gentleman has a bottle.”
You did an excellent job of telling of the storied life and amazing career of Lt. Col Frank Boune.  I like your background and music at the end.
"Officer on Parade"
Looking at the replies / comments to this excellent Bio of Color Sergeant Bourne , shows just how the movie Zulu , I think played an important role in the Australian Army . This movie being shown to Australian troops in 1967 /68 on their way to Vietnam , through to the late 80's , is saying some thing about Zulu the Movie , The Discipline  & courage of the British & other's .who fort there  at the time . If those Soldiers did not follow orders , I am sure they would have been wiped out in the first wave of Zulu Warriors . So I salute the Sergeant and the Officers that held the troops together . aussie bob .
What a hero. Thank you SIR. JML
I am pleased he lived long enough to see Germany's surrender.
"I say, we must have gotten a hundred of them!" "Great. We only have 3,900 left."
The reason why they got 11 VCs was because of the defeat ar Isandwana, they needed a good story to turn the defeat into victory
Come back ye British soldier, come back to Mandalay where the flying fishes play, and the sun comes up like thunder from China across the bay
He should have been the Victoria Cross as did the others.
He was offered a VC or commission. He declined the commission is that why he recieved the DCM instead of the VC? Was it a trick question?
Both my grandfathers served in the British Army starting sometime before 1900 as they were born around 1878 both served through ww1 one a captain the other his sergeant they were from the town or village in Wales childhood friends and remained so all their lives
*Sometime in the past 20yrs., an uncle and his nephew were at beach in San Diego and the young nephew began screaming from a shark ripping-off a portion of his arm* *The 40-something paunchy uncle swam-out like 'Weissmuller in his prime' and began beating and ripping at a 6-ft long shark w/his bare hands and drags the shark by it's gill-slits to shore, gets a knife from someone and slices-open the shark's belly and retrieves nephews arm which was re-attached in a 30-hr. long operation and after some months the boy's arm was useful again* ____________ *THAT'S WHO I WANT W/ME AT 'ROARK'S DRIFT'* *OR ANYWHERE ELSE* *This 'Color Sgt. Bourne' sounds like an earlier version of the 'Uncle' who doesn't know what 'Defeat' even means or 'Retreat' either...it would be a privilege to stand w/a man like that, or the 'Black Gang' stokers aboard 'Titanic' that sealed themselves in behind water-tight doors to 'keep the electricity going' despite knowing they would all surely die*
there's a good lad
"There's a good gentleman" love that line and the perfect delivery.
I absolutely love Zulu and I'm very happy to know that Bourne was so highly regarded and done so well in real life.  He must of been a living legend in his local community, could you imagine this guy walking into a pub for pint and to read the paper smoking his pipe, every bloke and young man must of walked past him taking off their hat saying sir.    I actually shouted and was in disbelief that the BBC threw out a recorded interview with this legend, such a shame, but he will never be forgotten.
Where can I find the transcript of his BBC interview?
Colour Sergeant Bourne reminded me of a family forebear Colour Sergeant Norris (who hailed fromCounty Cork, Eire) who was posted to India in around 1850, where he remained for 21-years (3 7-year tours). He never came home but married a local girl in Kasmir. his daughter Isobel was my maternal grandmother. From the stories she recounted to me as a child, I immediately pictured him as a C/S Bourne type. I loved the movie ZULU, still do. Thanks for posting, History Chap.
Amazing story, thank you!
Hitch... Hitch, I saw you. You're alive.
It’s astonishing how much historical recordings the BBC threw out
“And a bayonet, sir….With some guts behind it”
WOW, this was a really intresting story about an "ordinary" man! Regards from Sweden.
The Royal tournament always had the royal naval gun run, could you please do the history of the real story. If you haven't already done it
Best soldiers in the world then and now
What were the english doing there?
Why wasn't he given the Victoria Cross? He certainly earned it.
Million dollar idea for free...self sealing sand bags
What a life! It spanned the Crimean War to WWII! More so was his participation some historic campaigns. Of his like we won't see again - sadly.
You can always rely on the bbc Biased broadcasting co
I first saw "Zulu" in 1972, at 17, with a bunch of fellow Texan hippies in a university repertory film series. Every time the Zulus killed another white Brit the audience came to its feet and roared approval. It was considered the correct, if not polite, thing to do at that time.
"They know my voice when they hear it, Sir."
One of the all-time best movies and a favorite of mine since I saw it in 1964 at the drive-in.  I never understood why Color Sgt. Bourne wasn't mentioned in the VC list mentioned at the end of the film.  I know why now, but I've often wondered why the film's producers didn't simply explain that he chose a commission in lieu of VC.
"Spit Lad Spit"!  Thanks for the great upload, I was fascinated by the film as a child
A real british soldier.
The actor Nigel Green committed suicide after a marriage breakup and severe depression not long after the film 😢
"Name....Name You're alive, I've seen you."
What great men they where and what a great man bourn was brilliant brave men
Do your top button up,where do you think you are.
Thank you for the history
British Bungling Corporation are still destroying our Heritage, shower of Rats.
Bourne: cup of tea in one hand, bayonet in t other. Stoic is an understatement for him, poking the impis like sacks without fear.
Elegantly put, told and  executed   in some ways he was the biggest man there .
fantastic history of a fantastic soldier.
I have to agree that Nigel Green's performance made him one of the highlights of the movie, and I've been laboring under the belief that the real Coulor Sergeant Bourne was awarded the Cross.  It's so interesting to hear how he was actually rewarded for his invaluable role in that action, and how he felt about the Zulu warriors who faced the British soldiers at Rourke's Drift.  Bourne had a distinguished and inspiring career, and this video was beautifully put together.  Excellent work!
Great history lesson 👍 Thank you as always my friend. May God bless you with His peace.
Salute to the true bravery on both sides.
This was very interesting thank you
Where was he buried?
My best line from Colour Sergeant Bourne was "Say sir, officer on parade" . Military procedures must be confirmed even when surrounded by hundreds of dead!
You asked so here goes.... After a gruelling Life&Death struggle lasting all night, the inevitable morning roll call has to be performed. Precious few are present. Colour Sergeant Bourne conducts the sombre proceedings stoically with a pencil. So many names are absent, presumed dead. He gets to Hitch. But Hitch doesn't answer. Bourne tuts and  says loudly, "Hitch, I've seen you... You're ALIVE.." Meekly you hear Hitch respond from somewhere in the pitifully sparce line of surviving troops. He replies boyishly... "Ah, thank you very much Sir..." CLASSIC LINE, MY FAVOURITE.  I WET MYSELF LAUGHING EVERYTIME. FOR ME, IT SUMS UP THE BATTLE PERFECTLY Ravi from London in Australia
So the BBC have always been crap !
Awesome, ty
Hollywood does change characters slot from the original person or book. One of my favorite Hollywood imaging is of Alan Quartermain from the the books of H. Rider Haggard. In the books I don’t think he peaks at 5’ 4” and weighs about 130 lbs. His only named gun is a percussion cap fowling piece from his first book. He was only a love interest in the first books, the later relationships were between those who hired him and another character. So in the movies he is over 6 feet has a special, named long rifle and sweats all the lovely actresses off their feet.
I am Canadian.  I read in British East India History, the British Army created the Legendary Gurkha army.  The British Army never formed a Zulu army.  What has changed, eh?
"Nobody told you to stop working . . . get sweating!"
I would like to hear about the Royal Irish Fusiliers relieving Ladysmith in the Second Boer War. My great grandfather Thomas Reilly served with them there.
A truly wonderful commentary on a truly remarkable and humble man.
What is Non Commissioned Officer.    What does "Colour" mean?
I just found this today.  Rorkes Drift is an awesome story and Colour Sergeant Frank Bourne was an excellent NCO.  I had the pleasure of serving with many fine NCOs during my time in the U.S. Army.  You may have covered this but if not, I would like to see/hear your take on Hector the Hero (Major-General Hector MacDonald).
Wow. That's interesting. Thanks
"say sir....officer on parade" Love it
(His report -- calm, cool, professional): "The sentries report Zulus to the southwest, thousands of 'em."
Where was the School of Musketry located in Dublin? Great video.
No comeadians, please
Enjoyed this video, it popped up on my YouTube feed. I must have watched the film Zulu more than a dozen times over the years. Nice to know that “The Kid” died at a ripe old age, having had clearly a successful military career.
I really enjoyed your brief and yet detailed interesting information on this...thanks.
Get Swicking!
I only got to know about this battle, when I joined the army in 1973. I was sent to the Prince of Wales division depot in Crickhowell, I was badged Royal Welch Fusiliers, there were another eight regiments within the division. And one of them was the Royal Regiment of Wales (SWB), as it’s their regimental day. We had a regimental dinner where we were served by senior ranks and officers. And watched the film
Brave lads My Grandfather Was on the SOMME 3 tours  and Got the Gas in at ARRAS 😥He took 10 yrs to DIE😞War IS ALL ABOUT THE BANKS OLD MONEY BOYS 😒BASTARDS g
Excellent.  Thank you for this very informative video.
Just caught this thank you very much.How about doing a clip on Mirbat. Oman. and the Batt team out there.That is a story which needs telling and the VC medal being given .
I've always loved the film, but now at 74yrs of age, I ask, were the Zulu warriors not just defending their land from intruders ?
A bit of family history, my Great Uncle Harry was there as part of the commissariat, and my father remembers he , Uncle Harry, brought back an Assegai as a souvenir, cheers
Do your buttons up, there's a good lad. That's Sir Hook, Officer on parade, can I unbutton my tunic now Sir, and dies. Whoever thought it would be a good idea to wear a red tunic battledress in foreign lands noting the Boers really knew how to dress for battle
Won't happen in this day but a tv series with him as the main character going through his life could be facinating.
Different breed of man then certainly not from the generation now who go to pieces when their internet connection collapses or who are obsessed with the complete BS that is Love Island or  other useless trash such as Britains got talent.
Thanks.  God save the Queen
‘Stop throwing those bloody spears…’
"Aaaaaaaaaall right then. Nobody told you to stop working." "Do up your tunic! Where do you think you are, man?"
The British really do love their war criminals don't they. Pathetic people
This answers a question I ask every time I watch Zulu. I could never understand why he never got a VC especially when you look at some who did, like Commissar Dalton, although I assume he did more in the actual battle than is shown in the film to warrant his.
My Hero, used his style very successfully in my 22 year, career in the Royal Navy, although no Zulus, except on the doors above two deck.
Well it's great for you British to be celebrating your murderous Victorian Wars that caused famine, destruction and suffering in it's wake.  And you guys are still stirring shit in the world to this day.  You divided the world against itself in the past,  the difference is today the rest of the world is watching.
One of my favorite movies but you can’t find it anymore on Amazon or YouTube. They probably took it down because they say it’s racist or something PC bs.  “He breaketh the bow & stare at the Speer in sunder.”  “Hitch, Hitch! Hitch you’re alive, I saw you.”.
You don't become CS at 24 unless you are one hard man.5t 3 or not.
In mid-1978, a handful of friends and I took an "unscheduled" holiday from our university studies to go down to Babanango in Natal, to be extras in the film "Zulu Dawn". This kindled a greater interest in the Anglo Zulu war and over the years I have gathered a fantastic set of books as well as original engravings from the Illustrated London News that depicted battle scenes of that ill-fated campaign. Both "Zulu" and "Zulu Dawn" were "generous" in their depiction of these two iconic battles - as is much of the historic record. Little is spoken of the bravery of individual Zulus- perhaps not surprising as they made no written record of their own tactics and heroes. In any event, it is a fascinating period in British Imperial History, and it's sad that schools both in SA and the UK do not make more of this campaign. Rorkes Drift is indeed one of the great defensive encounters of the 19th-century British Army. Very informative video... Thoroughly enjoyable!
Colour Sgt Frank Bourne: My Queen, we fought one hell of a bloody battle.  The Queen: Zulus?  Colour Sgt Frank Bourne: NO! We won!
WOW, he was alive in my lifetime. Not for very long, but still, how amazing.  Lest we forget
When asked by a young terrified recruit why it was they who had to fight this battle, the Color Sargent responded " Because it's us here and no one else". Simple straight forward explanation of a bad situation. GREAT movie, shows respect and honors both sides of the conflict.
Thanks for telling us a great Man's life story 🧐
I KNOW YOU'RE ALIVE I'VE SEEN YOU..😁😁😁
Ever since my first viewing of this movie I was so impressed by Color Sargent Frank Bourne's reply to the young soldier, I wanted to remember it. In this video it was, Bourne replied, “Because we’re ‘ear, lad, no ____, just us.” I've replayed that scene numerous times, but still cannot understand the word spoken, "... no ____ ...". Hopefully, someone with better hearing than mine can tell me what that word was.
"Jones ? . . .  Jones, you're not dead !! I've seen you  !!"
“Do your button up lad.  Where do you think you are!”
I was given a pile of the prop uniforms when I ran a small military museum in the 80s in Essex. I thought I'd taken possession of a treasure trove until I opened the large box and discovered that the tunics had been stored in soaking wet conditions and were sodden and mouldy and stuck together, literally dripping with water. They actually fell apart as I tried to separate them. I seem to recall a couple of them had the actor's names written inside the collars, including Stanley Baker's. What a let-down.
Bourne also served with Cpl Jones at the Battle of Omdurman where it was first learned that the Fuzzy Wuzzies did not like it up 'em! Cpl Jones subsequently learned that the Germans also did not like it up 'em!
As most of us know sergeants are the real back bone of leadership in the field of any army. It’s very hard to understand how he didn’t get a Victoria cross
The "Right Stuff".
Great video!  From ordinary recruit to Lt. Colonel is likely impossible now.  This was one tough customer!
My god its BOURNE
My favourite Bourne quote is: “Get some rest, Pam. You look tired”
Cos we’re ere!
Didn't he go on to be in the first Jumangi?
The awarding of high military honours is always a fraught thing, even if there are not political considerations. . .  But we endlessly debate the actions of the most conspicuous of those who 'missed out',  so, history is kind to these men.
What a Brilliant Documentary please take a Bow....there's a Good Lad!.......Alllll right then! Nobody told you to stop working! Superb Film never, ever get bored watching Zulu.
It would be interesting to hear the Zulu viewpoint on this war. After all they were defending against an invasion of their country.
He had a good long life
"Hitch?... Hitch your alive. I saw you". "I am? Thanks very much".
Brilliant it is a really good presentation and I enjoyed listening to it
I read recently a scathing comment from some ignoramous about the British army and its rank structure. It was obvious that this was from some left leaning no hoper filled with misconceptions from a minor university. It went something like this ; The British army is structured around the officer class filled with toffs from British public schools, served by uneducated peasants drawn from the working class and disciplined by non commissioned officers.' Or words to that effect. As an ex. army NCO, I was highly insulted by this obnoxious ignoramous and replied to that effect, along with quite a few others, I noted. Quite a few of my peers were commissioned, one even to the rank of L.Colonel.
From Mexico, thank you for the wonderful way you present the story of an extraordinary man, and time. Thank you again.
Thanks for that.
National rifle club? For preparedness... We could do with that now
I really appreciate the work you have done to bring him back to life many years after his passing. I do hope his resting place is well cared for.
Great Vid and lesson in History - can't believe some Gumby at the BBC binned the interview tapes, due to lack of historical significance, imbecile
Just goes to show you don't have to be a big person to become a big person.
'The gentleman has a bottle'.....
Perhaps the Colour Sergeant who assigned him to A Company knew what he was doing and realised what a truly big man he was, in character if not in height. The sort of man you'd want beside you in any crisis, domestic or military. Dying the day after VE day- wonder if he hung on to see that bit of the job done. Would have loved to have heard his voice....
Very interesting - thank you. Do you know where he is buried, as I would love to visit that place to pay respects - what a life story - amazing.
Brilliantly done 👍👍
Great video.
“Why are we here? We should be at home getting rid of the Royal family who are there by accident of birth”.  But on the DVD that was in the deleted scenes segment.
Fasten your collar lad. Where do you think you are?
As a British Veteran (Army) I knew that I stood on the shoulders of giants. As a Welshman and an ex member of the Corps of Royal Engineers I feel a particular affiliation to the South Wales Borderers, I almost went that way myself. Of course we all know that Stanley Baxter led the men through that battle.  Ably assisted by Michael Caine. A brilliant film and a beautiful story. RIP Colour Sgt Bourne. We’ll never forget them here in South Wales, their museum at Brecon is well worth a visit. Thank you for a great vid.
I really enjoyed this presentation. It is lively and informative, no padding, not boring for a moment. I wish  there were more Youtube presenters who could put across their message so well.
Hero of the Empire 🇬🇧
So this is why Jason Bourne is indestructible? Related I presume?
In Russia today they'll be creating their own myths about their justified 'special operation'  in Ukraine and the bravery and righteousness of their troops. There's will be fascist revisionism too.   This vid is nauseating imperialist tosh. It turns my stomach.
Interesting thx
Well done Sir....my Great Grandfather, JOHN WILLIAM FIELDING, stood with his Comrades to save their own lives, John WAS awarded a V.C. unlike C.S. Bourne which you relate to...much to the discontent of the existing and continuing Family.  Many, many stories have been handed down to 'Our Family' over the years. One that might interest you is that Cy Endfield, along with Stanley Baker, shortlisted Michael Caine to play the part of HOOK, not Lt. Bromhead ! JOHN, "Williams"..(Fielding) was with Hook in the Hospital...well documented.  Sir...I had the privilege of meeting ZULU KING GOODWILL ZWELITHINI at the Pageant held at Brecon Barracks on the 21st July 2019, sadly deceased now. Along with a Gathering of "Ibutho", a number of whom had MOBILE PHONES (switched off), a most enjoyable and unforgettable Day...AND THE SUN SHONE ALL DAY. My Mother, OLIVE, (Nee: Fielding), has just reached her 95th Year...with Her Sister, now in her 92nd Year, they hold many memories of their Grandfather. The FIELDING name is carried through my 2 Cousins and extended Family as MY Grandparents only had 1 Son, ALWYN, the remaining 7 Children being Girls. KEEP SAFE, FRIEND....G.A.R.
What a wonderful story. Thank you.
Maybe the GLOUCESTERSHIRE Regiment at the battle of the Imjin River in the Korean War they along with others held the Chinese peoples army at bay so as the UN could reform
Favourite quote? Has to be when he's doing the roll call, "Call me sir, officer on parade!" Priceless.
Thank you for this fine presentation. I read the Book "Washing of the Spears: The rise and Fall of the Zulu Empire when it was first released and highly recommend it to any interested in the campaign. The Zulus formed the backbone for many police units across the area after the defeat. Many were still serving in the police up through at least the early seventies not sure now information is a bit thin on many subjects from the area.
Riveting and fascinating story.  You have me hooked - Subscribed.
I always felt that he didn't get the VC even though he deserved it because he was simply doing the job that was expected of him. Awarding military medals is a strange process. My father told the story of an air gunner in his squadron who refused to clear his plane for a mission because the guns were defective. He was overruled by the pilot. During an attack by enemy fighters the cocking mechanism on the guns broke and the gunner was forced to cock the guns using the red hot stub bolt that held the cockling toggle on. His hands were burnt to the bone but his actions saved the plane. For that action the pilot was awarded the DFC, the co-pilot received an honourable mention and the gunner was ignored.
"no comedians now, just answer your name"!
"That's the good gentleman"
I think I need to watch that movie again :)
“No comedians pkease”
Had he accepted that commission 11 years before,he would have been a general by the end of his career.. magnificent fine fellow and a real soldier...
Class show love it
The modern US Army needs to pay attention to examples like this.  Far too many NCO's and Commissioned Officers only concerned about themselves nowadays.
There's a good gentleman...
" Right, noone told you to stop working! ". Great film that I've seen at least a dozen times over the years. Thanks for the excellent video.
Enjoyed Lt Col Bournes story very much and was really surprised that he lived until the day after CE day in 1945. He was truly a remarkable soldier and a leader of other soldiers in the 'lower' ranks.
Where going to need a bigger boat . Wait shark week
my favorite part was when after the battle he did roll  call so professional thanks for the video on him one of my favorites in the movie
Really interesting thanks
sIze doesn't matter, it's discipline and heart
I have always respected British military excellence but why were you there? That is the real question. Queen Victoria's imperialist tendencies were not much to brag about.
As a Vietnam Vet, Shame on the Crown for failing to Honor one of their greatest hero's  courageous service in the face of death............ politics.  But praise be to the LORD GOD of my salvation, My guess,  Retired  LT Col. F. Bourne  was a man of the faith: A heavenly minded Man towards GOD. with full heavenly  honors bestowed on him by the LORD GOD Jesus Christ himself. amen..........
No Comedians please …I remember that line
"He breaketh the bow and snappeth the spear asunder...." Bourne probably had something to do with the amazing accuracy of the British in the early days of WW1 when the "mad minute" firing awed the Germans and took such a toll of their ranks.
great movie..true i always wonderd why the sergeant never got the vc...good doco
What a good staunch chap Colour sgt Bourne. Thank you for this information
Favorite quote from the movie, "Nobody told you to stop working- get sweated."
Wonderful documentary, Thank you. Have watched "Zulu" more times than I can remember, and read "The Washing of the Spears" by Donald Morris. I wondered what happened to CS Bourne.
An illegal, contrived invasion for resources.... A defeat due to arrogance and incompetence of officers.... A Nation forced to concentrate on one single action to redeem the loss of an entire expeditionary force. No wonder they threw medals at them.
"Get sweating!"
Why any Irishman would serve in the army of his demonic occupiers is beyond me.
In that cathederal Mona Best married ( mother of Pete Best of beatles fame ).
It would be interesting to see a story on some of the post war interventions. South East asia, Gulf States, Africa
Brilliant history, delivered memorably and as a fitting testament to the unflinching spirit of the men who served from Victoria to George VI.
One of the reasons I joined the United States Marine Court infantry was this movie My dad introduced me to it had a young age I was in awe of their courage !
My favourite line: "Mr. Witt ..now be quiet ..there's a good gentleman..we don't want to upset the lads". Unlike Frank Bourne, actor Nigel Green died relatively young.
I would like to hear them all !! would be great thank to the lives of the Queens Solders !!! No fear in life or battle on land or sea .  The British soldier with Bayonet and kit was a site to see .  He was a force to be reckoned with and afraid of nothing.
How about when he told the private to button up his shirt as they faced the Zulus. 😄
in the middle of that bruhaha he gets on that guy's case about his top button?
The backbone of the army
Just after some distracting incident: "Aww right...  Nobody told ya to stop werkin."
I'm ex British Army. And believe me The Army is built around men like him. And don't think they have no humour.
You really need to make a video about General Smith-Dorrien.  Turning the British Army into a professional army in the early 1900's and then saving it in WW1 by defying French's asinine orders that would have lost the army - he's deserving of more fame.
“No Comedians Please” Color Sgt Bourne
Since I first watched "Zulu" in 1964, Color Sgt Bourne has grown taller and bigger, every time I saw that movie again and again. He portraits a perfect soldier, was the foundation boulder of the company, in the movie. The role call after the bloodbath really impressed me.  Just like they always said, the Brits have soldiers like lions but led by donkey generals.
STEADY
You and mark felton make up 90% of the good content on here
So they got a six foot five actor to play a five foot three historical character - ? But then Michael Caine's character actually had dark hair and a beard.  Ahh, that's  the film industry for you - !
Super video...so informative and excellent production
Great story. Thank you!
Thanks for a great video
"Allllright then, nobody told you to stop working"

"Zulus to the Southwest - thousands of 'em". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjD_cpFc69E
Thank you so much for bringing this to us. "ZULU" was a fantastic historical film and those of us in military service in the 60'S hoped to be as strait up as this Color Sergeant  Bourne..what a great career and contribution he made during his 40 year career..played by Nigel Green .  It was a terrible loss when Green passed at only 47 yrs of age.
That was absolutely fantastic, thank you
What movie. I thought the battle was popular due to Sabaton making a movie about it.
Very interesting and informative. I own all three versions of Zulu. "The Gentleman has a bottle." Speaking of the drunk vigor.
What a hero.
Brilliant, thank you.
Because, we're here, lad, nobody else is my favorite line
I would be interested to hear your account of lt.Colonel WTMarshall VC of the 19th Huzzars who won his award at El Teb in Sudan on 29th February 1854. He too was commissioned from a sergeant so closely matches the career of sergeant Bourne. WT Marshall was my grandfather.
I liked his no nonsense, yet sensitive roll call at the end of the battle.
What a great story, well presented! Very enjoyable - a Subscribe from me!
Great story! And I saw this film when it first came out. Later I became a professional actor (SAG since 1977) with lots of film and TV experience. It was people like Nigel Green I always paid attention to when I was a young man - the "character" actors who made the "stars" look good, and inspired me in my professional activities. This, before I ever thought of acting as a  career. Green OWNED the screen whenever he did anything. He was also very good in another film Caine was in..."The Ipcress File."
Well I’m shocked I live in his village
IIRC it was Stanley Baker who wanted this fight REMEMBERED...Nigel Green was the BEST character actor for that role...
Its character holds the line if not for a better word and rallies when all against as is true of all who serve in any military of any nation.
Was it the event that made this movie great , or it was  the movie  that that made the event memorable. It seems like the director of the movie was a general !
I agree i found it wrong he did nor get the V.C. I am extremely thankful to you for what  u have said about him. Yes i would love to know more about Lt. Evelegh  (early engineer) during the Great Siege : Gibraltar 1779\83.   Sgt. nice is famous for thinking of tunneling, but it was Evelegh who produced our unique “Galleries”. I have more info. If u r interested.  J.J.Rosado  Gibraltar. Thanks
"Because we're here lad, and no body else" very much my favorite. Cheers great video.
"Who told you to stop working?"
quality film-  nicely researched and informative, thanks 👍
Yes both officers got the cross ,why not the couloir Sargent  British snobbery at its best
Absolutely Fascinating.  Thanks for this info.  I had always wondered what became of him.  And why he was never awarded the Victoria Cross.
He had to hang around until after VE day just in case he needed to go kick Adolph's ass.
Thank you. I forget sometimes that these people from the past were real and some were quite amazing.
You guys would never have won if it had been a fair fight. We demand a rematch, only this time we will be using AK74’s and RPG’s.
Your only supposed to blow the bloody boers up.

Really enjoyed this. Thank you.
During my time in the RN the most typical NCO words of wisdom ( sarcasm) was when I was on my way back to my mess deck down the ladder and one step from the bottom,I came face to face with the " master at arms" ( responsible for discipline in all ranks) he said to me quite quietly.....am I " urtin you son?" No sir,I replied......then in a loud and bellowing voice said " I SHOULD BE.... I'M STOOD ON YOUR FUCKIN HAIR......GET IT CUT......." Then I backed up the ladder so he could continue...... Those were the days
You also need to visit the headstone of private Fredrick Hitch in chiswick old Cemetery. It is draped in a union flag with his pithe helmet on with his VC.
Excellent video! You have a gift to bring back to life events and people of the past. I will never forget watching "Zulu" when I was 10 years old in 1969. Although born and bred in Argentina and without a drop of British blood (I am of Italian descent) I remember how I cheered the red coats on. I am 63 years old now and I see with bitterness and anger how white men today (and particularly the British) are "ashamed" of the heroic deeds of their ancestors and apologize for everything you can imagine. We Europeans have nothing to apologize for. Greetings from Buenos Aires.
'Centurion' , that's the word that comes to my mind when I think of this man.
Big man in a 5'3" package.
Colour sergeant Frank Bourne turned down his VC. The reason is as follows: in the film the scene is where C/Sgt Bourne is against the sandbags the officer says 'Colour Sargent " CSgt Bourne looks up and replies "yes sir, I was sleeping" it is because of this he felt that he had let his regiment down. He declined to accept the VC. He continued to get promoted to the rank of lieutenant Colonel.
👍
An incredible man.
After Islawanda it was decided that British Ammunition boxes should be able to be opened without a special tool, it is thought the loss or breaking of the tool let the soldiers be overrun. I watched the film and was really annoyed at how the QM was portrayed as being miserly in giving out the ammo. Reminded me of my service, ``Them´s is Stores sonny, not issues, now bugger off!´´ ;) The VC is often a matter of luck as a well, one guy got it in WW1 because his Regiment decided that he didn´t cheat on their Rum or Whisky ration by putting his thumb in the cup and so getting an extra portion himself, when the Regt or unit received a VC he was chosen as the recipient. The most confusing of all UK Awards is the MiD or Mentioned in Despatches, the earliest of all UK awards, did he nearly get a VC, MC or something else? Recently there has been huge bravery but the VC is for, ``Bravery in the face of the enemy´´, that doesn´t count for rescueing comrades in a Blue on Blue :(  In Northern Ireland no VC´s were awarded because the Government called it a Police Action and not a War, so the bravest got the George Cross.
In the film the only guy who never flinched
Fascinating. Thanks for the upload.
I lived next door to Cy Endfnield the director of the film ZULU. I was their baby sitter and invited to go with them when Zulu was filmed. But my Dad wouldn't permit it. He was such a brilliant man. Hounded out of America for allegedly being a communist.  As you can Imagine Zulu is my all time favourite film. I particularly love the part when Ivor Emmanuel sang Men of Harlech to raise morale.  MAGIC, Thank you for such an interesting video.
I admire the colour Sergeant even more after watching this and when you told us he died a day after the end of WW2 he must have been listening to his country beiing bombed by the Germans  as he sat in old age. you can't imagine what he was thinking listening to Churchill's speeches..'we shall fight them on the beaches'..'AND A BAYONET!!!'
What a full and amazing life! Great vid.
Wait a minute... at 8:49 you say "Bourne was actually offered a VC _or_ alternatively, a commission." And you say he refused the commission. So why didn't he accept the VC?
What a man. Greatstory.
They know my voice when they here
All this bravery done in service to the evil of colonialism. Hooray!
Thank you so much for this video!  Zulu is my all-time favorite war movie, and as a 30-year military veteran myself (CMSgt, USAF, Ret), the valor of Colour Sergeat Bourne strikes me as a ever-ending example to the enlisted force.  Well done, Colour, and godspeed.
get sweating!
Thank you for this video, it was very informative. I find historical people like Colour Sergent Frank Bourne very inspirational.
Describing the Zulus at the Drift as a force overstates them. Best described as a mob or rabble is much closer. The king had ordered that none should cross the  river. All were at risk of punishment and they knew this, thus not making a good force, but a poorly disciplined group.
He went all woke.
I  have  actually visited the  site in South Africa,  I  was too young to  fully understand or appreciate  the  honour and  privilege it was to have been there.
What a legend great video they don't make men like that anymore.
There are a lot of graves of those who fought at Rorkes Drift in Ribbleton Cemetery, Preston, England.
@Tatum Argo- I didn’t know all of that. I knew what rifles they were using and that they were some distance from their ammo wagons, but that’s about all I knew with respect to what the reasons for the massacre at Isandlwana were. Well, That and what I seen in the movie Zulu Dawn, which I have no idea how accurate it was.  Like Zulu portrays Henry Hook  as a drinker and troublesome when from what I gather is that he was a non drinker and English, not Welsh. Both Isandlwana and Rorkes Drift fascinate me. Thank you for the information.
When it's either do or die, you find out what people are made of. I have watched the movie Zulu dozens of times. Great film, and I can't imagine what it was like to live through that.
Pvt. Cole actually lived through the battle but did not answer roll call, as he was buried under the hospital with Hooks, and was later listed as MIA in the rolls. In fact, Bourne later helped Cole with his kit, as while you could be promoted in the British army, they would not pay you if you were listed as dead. Cole also became an officer and eventually received pay, and he may have outlived Bourne as well. I knew his great-grandson Alan Cole jr., who was Captain of Brigade in Rhodesia, and his father was killed on the San Pueblo spy ship when it was captured. I believe the Cole's had their own coat of arms (a bear?), and I think another Cole ancestor is in a painting overthrowing some Noble, and was later hanged for his troubles.
What happened to the leader of the Zulus?
Hi, like the rest of my generation, we were brought up on films such as ZULU !. really enjoyed your video, thanks. My father fought the Japanese in Burma during the war, do you have any stories of this campaign ?
All right then, no one told you to stop workin!
Thoroughly Enjoyable thank you
thank you......
That was a brilliant film. I loved the part where the zulus were chanting at the same time the soldiers were singing “men of Harlech”. The way the two went together was brilliant as well 👍👍
Thank you! Bloody awesome!
This story has always fascinated me. I’m so glad this popped up. What a MAN.  They simply don’t make ‘em like this anymore   “Because we're here, lad. Nobody else. Just us.”
Got two spears from the battlefield picked up by a distant relation ...any idea of the value?
WOW! He saw the ends of BOTH WWI and II. Who would have thought? Thank you very much for this VERY interesting commentary about a very interesting war hero.
Fantastic video, I'd no idea he'd lived so long after.
"Because we're here, lad. Nobody else. Just us." is one of the most PROFOUND comments I've ever heard in ANY movie...ANY time. I'm 76, a combat veteran, and I've seen many MANY movies. So I KNOW from whence I speak!
"Alright, nobody told you to stop working!"  and "they know my voice when they hear it" with his simple confidence he broke the spell of the zulu's chanting.  I'm glad army pay increased so that he could afford a commission. it's like my great grandfather, a private in the Boer war. RSM in WW1 and a colonel in WW2. too old by then to venture into combat but doing vital work at home to free up other men.
A soldier's, soldier.
What is the point of this video?
From a fellow historian, although Danish, very well done, Sir! You make history come to life!!!
The real Colour Sergeant Bourne was not the elderly father-figure as shown in the movie - he was just 24 years old. He was also rather short. It is believed that he forsook the Victoria Cross in exchange for a commission. According to some historians the real motivating force behind the defence of Rorke's Drift was the Commissary, Dalton.
Typical BBC. It was probably because he wasn't of colour, if he was, they wouldn't have binned the interview.
An amazing soldier.
Thanks for this brilliant story. 👏  Loved it.  What a man he must have been.
a bunch of "invaders" in a foreign land faced by spears and cow hide shields...wonderful hollywood "SHITE" !!  BIGGER PICTURE THO .imperialistic facism, colonial oppression enslavement....
what an awesome military career.
I bet he would be disgusted by what his country has turned into today
My favourite film, great insight there, you certainly know your stuff. Thank you.
What fantastic work you're doing. Great work. Thanks.
" Be quiet now will you? There's a good gentleman."
An amazing story, about an amazing man. I just find it so incredible about how humble he was yet he was also so determined.
Why us sir ? Because we here and nobody else
Would some kind person explain what a ‘colour’ sergeant is. Why not just ‘sergeant’?
“Never mind 'im boy. You get along to the ramparts with your mates. Mr. Witt sir... be quiet now will you, there's a good gentleman, you'll upset the lads.”
Sgt Williams... who with Hook fraught in the hospital is buried in Cwmbran South Wales.  I came across his grave by accident while at the pub next door.   I research this further and found out Williams (his real name he changed it to join the army)... and Hook evacuated those in the hospital while fighting off the Zulu's.  One patient had a (from memory) and dislocated arm or leg and wouldn't fit through a window they were using to get everyone out. So they could get this chap out they broke his arm or leg so he would fit through!!!  That got everyone out... hero's!!
"Hook...........Hook. Hook you're alive, I saw you.
What a great documentary.  Thank you.
Typical of the bbc to throw away something like that
Unfortunately Colour Sergeant Bourne fell unconscious. When he awoke he had forgotten most of the details of his life, including the fact someone put him into a time machine and sent him forward to the future ...
The battle of Assaye
Thank goodness for a presenter who says Lieutenant in the English way (leff tenant) and not in the US way (lootenant) It really grinds my gears when I hear that. Thank you and I’ve subscribed. 👍😃
I've just come across your channel and subscribed. Many historical events interest me, have you done the Glencoe massacre?
Come now theres a good gentleman
No respect for colonialism of course, but all my respect for this grand soldier, a true leader of men and an exemplar in doing his duty.
What a soldier, what a man.
Thank you so much for this, you have answered my questions very well.
No historic value, that sounds like the BBC.
To hold fast knowing the British army had just lost its entire force of 1,300 men at Islandwana is in itself remarkable but the film did something unusual for its time in recognising the discipline and courage displayed by the Zulus when charging ranks of guns whilst holding just a spear and shield.
A true Brit a great man rest in peace 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
'Orrrlrite'en. Nobody told you to stop working!'
Definitivamente um homem de valor, algo raro no mundo atual.
Fantastic first visit to your channel and definitely subbed!!!
OBE is "Officer of the Order of the British Empire". MBE is Member of the Order, etc. The first letter denotes the rank in the order. You cannot be awarded "The Order of the British Empire".
Great vid👍
zuuuuluuuuu!   zuuuuuluuuuu!  The Henry was a single shot breach loader.  Surely a step up from a muzzle loader, being loaded with what any modern rifleman would recognise as a 'round' today.  Still, the shear courage it would take to go into battle with such a weapon is beyond understanding, since the bayonet was an essential addition, not the curio "combat knife that happens to have a mount for the muzzle of your automatic carbine" that it is today.  Only the best trained troops would be able to do well with it when the odds are worse than 40 to 1.  Remember this was a rear-guard unit too.  The British army really took training seriously and still do today I believe...  training Ukrainian batteries to fight the Russians in an artillery war.  Damn proud of my heritage.  It was history like this that encouraged many "Tommies" to join up in 1914, but alas they were met with the realities of the new trench warfare, something that mostly showed no respect for shear guts.  We will probably never see the likes of Frank Bourne again, though his dedication to duty is as exemplary now as it was then.
A heart warming story of a proper servicemen.  Lovely story to hear
What an extraordinary life.
It was such a pleasure to watch this and not have my memories of the film crushed, the opposite actually, these were men who trusted their officers and the NCO’s. The present day Army is exactly the same, instilling the same values, the modern soldier has more to distract than their predecessors.
Best quote: "And a bayonet, with some guts behind it"
My family are buried in Beckenham Cemetery- as I will be - when my father died I found myself wandering around the grounds, reading headstone’s stretching back years and came across a large memorial tomb,  overgrown and uncared for, it read Lt Col Frank Bourne, C/sgt Rourkes Drift. Zulu was the first film I saw with my dad, it’s still my all time favourite movie, and here he was, a giant of British history, lying in the same ground as my old man. It was a very personal and moving moment that made me smile.
Clearly a giant of a man, beyond measurement in any conventional fashion!
Isn't Sgt. Bourne the one that said, "That's soldierin'."?  lol
Great story well told👍
I stand with the Zulus!
Completely fascinating. thanks for this.
Very interesting....many thanks...
Brilliant story, and what a soldier 👏🏼🍻
What a brilliant video.  I’ve subscribed.  Superbly well presented.  And the man himself Frank. True British hero.  Brilliant story
Brilliant, really enjoyed that. Your detailed research really shon through, really well presented and illustrated too. Thanks for the hard work involved.
And a bayonet with some guts behind,,, Best line of the film
My God he saw alot of war in his time
Thankyou that was terrific, what a legend, from farm labourer to Left colonel in those days that is amazing.
Awesome video ! Thank you
that kind of man does not exist anymore the Woke takeover  has seen to that.
Witness accounts tell of the 2 lieutenants being spotted trying to saddle horses and run away, their fellow officers described them as useless. The real defence was lead by the commisary and colour sergeant Bourne. The establishment decided that the officers should get victoria crosses and that the real heroes should het minor awards as they were of the wrong class- an attitude typical of the time. Following a huge uproar in the press, it was finally decided that the commisary should receive a victoria cross and Bourne the DSO. Money talks, merit walks as the saying goes
Thanks for a great insight on Colour Sergeant Bourne. Really enjoyed that.  Is there any chance of a video on the Battle for the Dargai Heights concerning The Gordon Highlanders?
Thank you for this, I was always interested myself in what happened to the men after the battle.
Amusing how historians rave about historical battles but never outline the context of why they were there. Murdering people who didn’t want to be subjects of the crown and getting medals for it. Nothing to celebrate about oppressing people and murdering thousands.
My favorite quotes is " It appears the gentleman has a bottle".
" no comedians, please"
My god !!! Someone at the beeb binned the audio … unfuckingbelieavable ..
My favorite line is during the final roll call. " Hitch? Hitch you're alive, I saw you!"       Hitch "Aye, thank you very much!"
Zulu is my all-time favorite movie, I loved the music and the singing "battle" between the British and Zulu warriors. The Color Sgt was my favorite role, such a stern yet caring soldier.
Get sweatin!
Thanx much for the presentation on Sgt. Bourne. I'd always wondered why no VC for him. As I see it now, he did get the well-deserved recognition of his country, the army, and a stellar military career. Well done, indeed, Sgt. Bourne!
What a great historical story about one of the heroes of Rourke's Drift.
"You lead backsided... get sweatin'!"
Colour Sergeant Bourne is one of those iconic names that I knew little about, thank you for this.
No one told you too stop working
51st highland.division st Valery
Thank You!  Yes, Nigel Green was a favourite character in "Zulu".  Hard to believe that he lived to see the end of WWII!  A humble hero of his time!  Thank you for this!
Hughes: Colour Sergeant Bourne! What's that shooting? Colour Sergeant Bourne: A rifle, Hughes. Hughes: Eh? Colour Sergeant Bourne: If you're sick in hospital, I'd suggest you go and lie down. Hughes: Yes, Colour Sergeant.
Colour Sergeant Bourne: It's a miracle. Lieutenant John Chard: If it's a miracle, Colour Sergeant, it's a short chamber Boxer Henry point 45 caliber miracle. Colour Sergeant Bourne: And a bayonet, sir, with some guts behind.
Sad that some clown at the BBC binned his interview.
Reverend Otto Witt: [shouting, drunkenly] He breaketh the bow and snappeth the spear in sunder! Colour Sergeant Bourne: [Quoting Psalm 46, v10-11 just before the battle] I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth. The Lord of Hosts is with us.
Watched 7 23 22
Brilliant commentary
As an American I have a great deal of respect for the British military. Our own military closely emulated them. They set a fine example.
6'4" to 5'3" that's quite a jump. Personally I'd follow the 5'3" guy. Seriously undersized; but has lived and thrived for decades.
Can’t tell how long I waited for it to come out on video.
What about the British Regiment in the siege of the legation Durning thr “Boxer Rebellion”. And the continued down history with the US Marines exchanging telegrams on St. David’s Day and The Birthday of The US Marines
Excellent.  I too wondered why no VC.   Thank you !
Excellent as always…. How about a video on the battles the Boris de Buttes The Devonshire Regiment cheers Tony Woollcombe
Nigel Green rippa actor, couldn't see anybody else in that role, could you? Nice job m8! Thanks!
Upon facing the oncoming battle- "Hinch. Do your tunic up. Who do you think you are, man?" Talking firmly  to the Preacher who is locked in the Stockade and is unsettling the soldiers. "Mr Witts, Sir. Be quiet now, will you. There's a good gentleman. You'll upset the lads."
"Nobody told you to stop workin"
One tough person in my book . And what a excellent story thank you soo much I have watch the movie many time's each line he said .And when the camera left him too focuses on someone else i am like come on go back too him .This is even after all the time's I have watch this movie
And it wasn’t that he did not win the V.C. He won all 11 of them.
“You slovenly soldier” :-)
Great show, liked and subscribed. If you haven't yet maybe the Highlanders at The Battle of New Orleans would make for a good show.
I believed that Lt. Chad (based on the movie) had not remained in the army after the Zulu War but found his grave marker at the Rochester Cathedral as Lt. Col Chad. Guess he stayed in.
Greetings Sir! Is the story sung by Emerson Lake and Palmer in their famous debut album ion the song track Lucky Man a true story about an historical figure in British military history and tradition?  And, if so, who is the hero in the song and during what period of British history did he live.  Please respond. Thank you for your attention and assistance,  Phillip Jones  PS And thank you for the programs about the Zulu Wars!
That is a good gentleman!
Sgt. Bourne absolutely was as big as the actor whom played him! Couldn't have stepped up, and been remembered for the greatest stand !
CSGT Bourn deserves the VC as much as those who received them.
Interesting video. I live 10 minute drive away from Balcombe village and drove through the other day on my way to Haywards Heath  and always think of Sgt Bourne. I believe his house has a plaque to Bourne though i have not seen it yet.
Bourne:  "Hitch, do your tunic up."  Hitch:  "Me tunic?!?"  Bourne:  "Do it up.  Where do you think you are, man?"
I remember a scene where the Sargent tells the Reverend “Be a good Gentleman and shut up!”
"Button you collar.  Remember you're English"
My favorite scene is when he did roll call at the end of the battle
V R ... E VII R ... G V R ... E VIII R ...G VI R
Great story. Really enjoyed it!
Wonderful story. Thank you. 😊
" I know you're alive",,,,, OMG I could watch this movie endlessly!  I even look at this place on Google Earth as well as Isandlwana.
a Single Word expresses my thoughts and feeling about the subject matter and this Youtube Video.. "WONDERFUL"
That was a great story! Think there was a lot of snobbery against the n.c.o's from wealthy boot lickers that had their commission paid for by daddy and then  " fought" from way back from the front line with big talk and large whiskeys
Because we're here lad,and nobody else!
What an absolute legend not at all like the twats you get in all these Victorian dramas on tv🧐
Great video thank u, where can ii find that interview transcript pl, watch that film with my dad from when I was young lad, he's a retired police officer and his inspector in training always told them to button up there tunics, as per the film,
I definitely can imagine the BBC doing that.. they’re a disgrace .
Interesting :  to Summarize the situation   An invading army England try to seize the ancestral hone of the Zulu for ( pure financial gain)  The Zulu is defending it's homeland  from invaders   The Zulu armed with ( spears ) attacked the invader the well equipped British army armed with the latest  rifles.  Hum : I would think that the Zulu  are the real heroes   It's just like the British to turn these ( murders ) into  heroes.  But then the British Empire is based on ( opium dealing / piracy / slavery )   And of course armed occupation of defenseless countries .   Exploiting the native and stealing their resources .  All in the name of ( capitalism ) ( white man' s burden ) ( spreading civilization / Christian values ) to the  world  Is the legacy of the British Empire /  where still dealing with there mess today
My grandfather was a colour sergeant  in Queen Victoria's army, he fought at the battle of Omdurman. He died in 1965 and somewhere along the way we lost all his medals. I would have loved to have passed them on to my great grand children (11).
Chris thank you🙏 your knowledge, research and your whole delivery is the best on here by a country mile👍 If at any point in the future you may happen across the story of 47 Cdo RM at Port-en-Bessin I think that would be a very interesting  story..or possibly Limbang..😬..
All right then
Hamish Henderson’s Anzio Pipe Band, playing to the British, Canadian and US troops shut up in Anzio 1944
Awesome story sir. Subbed.
"Be quiet now, there's a good gentleman.  You're upsetting the lads."
Zulus to the South west......thousands of em
Fantastic channel ole bean.
Incredible man.And men.
He said he had fallen asleep while on guard duty.  No court marshal but no VC either. Final fight scene is one of my favourites. Saved to video
"Look to your front...mark your orders...mark your target when it comes"
Invaders are never heroes. The heroes are the defenders.
Fascinating. I’m a keen follower of military history from the C18th/C19th and this movie captured my imagination. I know Wellington’s exploits at Waterloo are a well trodden path but how about a piece on his siege of Cuidad Rodrigo during the Peninsular War? Particularly, storming the breach in the city walls (the “Forlorn Hope?”)
Hitch I saw you.....  You're alive.
Rourke's Drift as told by Sooty & Sweep.
You slovenly soldier lol
I thought that Rorkesdrift was one word/name.
What an incredible life's journey. BTW:
A true hero and someone who served his country to the highest level.🇬🇧👍
Alrighttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt Then
Would love information concerning my Great Great Uncle Jerry Delaney who was praised  to become light weight champion boxer of the world but went to fight WW1. After being decorated at the Somme he was eventually killed at the Battle of Delville Woods. Lonsdale erected a monument to him in Bradford.
Very interesting. Many thanks for upload.
did he ever say "get off my lawn"?
Amazing man.. what a life
great man, where is he buried.
I didn’t think it was so much Zulu discipline at Isandlwana, but rather Her Majesty’s “thin red line” ran out of ammo and were engulfed by a sea of black.
Fighting for your life doesn't require courage.  Purposely exposing yourself to enemy fire does.  I'm sure that many men showed courage that day.  I'm just as sure that if the choice is to fight or die, almost everybody is going to fight. The Zulus showed great courage that day.  Running straight into gun fire after everybody around you just fell over dead.  Even if you thought that you were impervious to bullets, I'm pretty sure it wouldn't take long to realize you aren't.
Apparently Colour Sergeant Bourne, although not a giant in stature, was a giant of a man in character and courage.  Perhaps that's why Nigel Green was chosen to play him in Zulu.  I'm pleased to know that Bourne was awarded the MBE - richly deserved.
Mr Whitt Sir be quiet now will you. There's a good gentleman. You'll upset the lads
How are these men heroes ? If they where from any country other than the western european usa etc an invading country are branded terrorists . Why are they attacking us ? 😂because they are defending their land .idiots
This bloke is brilliant, top man....
Excellent summary. Thank you.
Fantastic.
Pvt Williams i ve seen u ur still alive
Thank you for sharing your research
Why is it us ,why us ? Because we're here lad nobody else just us
What a life!! What service!
"Thats a good gentleman"
Button your tunic- and put your helmet on!! Reminds me of one of my first sergeant’s.
I belivie the former runner of this Regiment was the 2nd Worcester/Warwicks
The English soldiers were not the defenders, they were the invaders. The Zulus were fighting and defending their homeland.
Nigel Greens deep voice when the cavalry departed and said "Alright! Nobody told you to stop working!!"
Another great video. I wonder if he has any family left, and if they know about their brave ancestor. Also what happened to his medals.
That was a pub conversation amongst some wargaming mates many years ago. I pointed out that as a Colour Sgt/Senior NCO Bourne was 'merely' doing his duty. I mean no disrespect by saying that, for I felt he should have been given some acknowledgement. I finished my pint and never did get to research this (I should have done!) Well done you for this video,  what a tremendous guy Bourne was, to refuse the VC (and making it a round dozen😊) in modesty. He did however get his recognition and lived a long, full and fascinating life.
It seems to me he had a better military career than any of the Victoria Cross winners, including Chard and Bromhead.
Well done
I am nevv to your channel. Do you ever do stories about the colonials. The north vvest mounted police or the R. C.M.P has a fascinating history and served as a military unit in the first boer vvar.
That was excellent!  I would be interested in knowing more about the demobilition of Commonwealth troops at the end of The Great War and how they were treated by their own countries.
He played "Hercules" in a fantasy movie. I saw him in a couple of different flicks too. This is a joke. but he was Hercules.
steady laaaads!!
A respectful request for consideration, slight adjustment in your material which is referring to CSFB NCO'S Father as a mere labourer which Im sure was not an intentional insult  otherwise good show.
Thank you for the story of this amazing man.
11 Victoria crosses given out to try and take the sting out off the bad press from the disaster the day before not saying they didn't earn it but there's a wee bit more to it, Chelmsford was fighting to keep his job afer the disaster before garent wolseley came to take over 👍
My great Uncle was killed at Isandlwana along with the entire group of soldiers.
Great story and great video...as an ex soldier I can relate to C/Sgt Bourne in many ways... although I would tower over him being 5'5" 3/4 inch tall
Then was a time when there was a country of which to be proud!
An Excellent Overview of this Most Important Historical Event….Thank You Sir 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
"Now do be quiet, there's a good gentleman. you're upsetting the lads".
Very interesting
“Aaaaall right then, nobody told you to stop workin”
What a great story. You really excelled there. An amazing bloke. I had no idea that he had such a distinguished career.  Thanks mate for another top notch story.
My favorite quote:  "All right then.  No one told you to stop working!"
Be quiet please, there's a good gentleman!
Wow! I really enjoyed your video. Zulu is one of my favorite movies. I always wondered why Bourne never got the medal. Thanks from Albuquerque, New Mexico (USA).
Superb. "And I thought you'd be bigger" 😂😂😂 A respectful h/t to, ah,  my own instructors also. A very foolish child indeed judges a book by its cover.
"The gentleman has a bottle, sir"
Wonderful video.
"And a bayonet, Sir. With some guts behind it."
Nobody told you to stop working
Mr History Chap. Do you know what became of Bourne's family? Does he have surviving descendants? It might be interesting to hear if they have any memories. Thanks for this personal insight into a REAL HERO.
Thoroughly enjoyed your vid - just subscribed with full military honours
Zulus, Sir - thousands of them.
RESPECT for your service.
THAT IS A MOVIE.
''Do your button up lad.'' Very clever psychology which served more than one purpose. 1. It distracted the young man from his fears. 2. It focused him in a disciplined way. 3. It was reassuring of a familiar and safer world. 4. It showed him who he should really be afraid of.
Honestly, when I first watched this movie decades ago, I was amazed at the courage and leadership that brought about the survival of these soldiers at Rorke's Drift.  Two decades later I found this movie on DVD and immediately purchased it.  This is a once a year "must watch" movie that reminds me of the courage of men and to bring my life's little problems back into perspective.  GOD Bless them all, Amen.
Excellent video.  I had always thought the Colour Sergeant went on to Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and helped save the day in that story. So, I am glad to know he lived a long and honorable life in military service.
Wow, watching those hives dissolve every day until they disappear is definitely appeasing, I went with what I commented about and after 20 or so days the urticaria’s history, I simply go'ogled the latest by Shane Zormander and now my skin is as smooth and healthy as it has ever been!
Remember watching this as a kid and rooting for the people who fought for their freedom and not the invaders.
I joined the Australian Army in 1962 and was posted to the Royal Australian Regiment (Infantry) on graduation.  I lied about my age to enlist as I was only 15 years old at the time and should have been 17 years old.  I had completed my enlistment papers but left my date of birth out.  My dad who had to counter sign the form noticed what I had done and said: "Oi, you have left out your date of birth."  I told dad to sign the form and I would fill out the details later.  My dear old Irish mother was horrified when she asked me what date of birth I had give the Army.  I told her I had given the date of June 1944 (when in reality, my date of birth was June 1946.  Quick as a flash, mum responded: 'WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME REPUTATION (in her quaint Irish accent) I WASN'T EVEN MARRIED THEN."  Mum and dad were married in September 1944.  As a former  Australian  Soldier, the funniest line I heard used (I am unsure whether or not it was really used of written into the film) was at that point after the Zulus  withdrew, the roll was called  which is a standard procedure.  C/Sgt. Bourne calling the roll came to Private Hitch.  He called Hitch's name twice and got no response.  C/Sgt. Bourne called out a third time.  "HITCH, YOU ARE ALIVE.  I SAW YOU."  Private Hitch then replies with words to the effect: "Oh Yes" .  C/Sgt Bourne responds.  "SAY SIR; OFFICER ON PARADE"  It has been years since I watched this film.  I hope I got the sequence of things correct.  Thank you kindly for an excellent programme.
Interesting. Thanks
He seems even bigger and braver than in the film... Rourke's Drift was just his starting point...
I struggle with emotions on all of this. I do admire the individual courage and self discipline of the enlisted personnel and NCOs. However, consider why they were there and why were they under attack.....they were invaders and the native population was trying to repulse their domination. Soldiers don't typically get to pick the battles. But they are judged for their character and heroism in battle regardless of the bigger right or wrong that their leaders created.  We have similar disparity of values in the U.S. One of the many examples exists near where I live. There is a park honoring the gallant heroism of a young officer in the19th century. He won great acclaim and admiration from his superiors for his courage and leadership in battle with the enemy. Who was the enemy? It was farmers and fishermen who were desperately resisting having their families and livelihoods forcibly displaced yet again to land even less desirable to their needs than the land they were defending.
when l enlisted in the australian army back in the early 1980's, they show this film as part of our training. One of the things l remember one of the NCO's saying. "He didn't get a VC because he was just doing his job". Never forgotten that.
What a great story, an unsung hero but obviously appreciated by the Army.
What a splendid story of a splendid gentleman
Meh.
As an American... I can't help but view such presentations as this with an intrusive realization of just how much your "ruling class" hates your country, your country's culture, your country's history, legacies, achievements, and people.  Granted, it is the same situation in all the English speaking countries.  It's infuriating and heart breaking, really. (Addendum: Thank you for this well done biography, incidentally.)
The BBC, while a fine organisation, has a penchant for destroying history.
Might be short, but his balls were steel
A memory surfaces: a while back I thought I heard part of the 1936 BBC interview with Lt Col Frank Bourne. Could this recording or part of it still exist?
Excellent and Outstanding!!!
Wth were the brits doing in S Africa ?
Poor soldiers sent to rape, kill and rob distant lands for a fat queen!
What a remarkable man.
What a grand fellow he was,l like the line in the film,alright no one told you to stop working,said in that superb Nigel Greens voice.
I'd like to hear the story of the public lynching of the peanut from the BBC who binned the recording of Bournes account of the battle because "it had no historical value".
Around 8m 55 sec..I'm confused Commission/VC but gets neither  .was £10 a year worth more  ?..Ahh so the commission could be held open..Dalton the ex RSM commisariat officer is interesting too
How about one on Joseph Windridge 🤔 'Who's the Sgt with the muscles '..of 'Pick up Yr Bundle you dopy Welsh man ' lol
Great story
Bad.  Ass.  That is all.
Dear Chris, I've got a suggestion for a British army topic: the Walcheren expedition in 1809. The British "storming the beaches" of Zeeland, the Netherlands to fight Napoleon (or his brother). School taught me the obvious Travalgar, Wellington and Waterloo, but this invasion was unknown to me until it was mentioned by the Kings & Generals channel. I know the campaign failed (no reason to give it no attention), but not much more.  Hope it tickles your curiosity and interest.  Thanks, a Dutch sub.
The Jack Russell of the army.....Michael Caine played a good part too as he had seen action as a real soldier .His interview about I'm sure it was Korea was scary funny ....The 3 of them taking a piss before charging in the night ....
"Somebody at the BBC didn't think it [the recording] was of historic value". Just about sums up that channel nowadays, he or she, fresh out of Uni, was probably embarrassed by it.
"A prayer is as good as bayonet on a day like this Reverend "
Fantastic. I really enjoyed hearing that he was honored and did well. Green really did him credit with his portrayal of him too.
My favorite line in the movie is when he was holding roll call after the battle.  One of the men fails to answer when his name is called.  Sergeant Bourne calmly says "I saw you. You're alive".  and the man answers, as if it were a pleasant surprise, "Why, yes. I am."
Fascinating.
Defenders or invaders? If Africa just had  50 more tribes like Shaka Zulu Slavery  would have never happened  .
I like the line, "Fire at will" to which the reply is "that's very nice of him". Classic.
Thanks for the excellent piece of biography. As far as a request for a video goes, I do have one. I served for quite some time in the Australian Army, and during some historical reading on the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux, mention is made in the sources I was reading of extraordinarily skilled action by British cavalry in both screening and providing reconnaissance for Australia forces. However, no mention was made of what regiment/s were involved, or exactly what they accomplished. Nonetheless, the action of cavalry in this battle was vital to the eventual victory that helped stop the 1918 offensive. Perhaps this is a small thing amongst British feats of arms, but as a vital action in a war where the value of cavalry is often derided, I think it would be an interesting little backwater to explore. For your consideration.
Sir, great video, so glad I saw it… the photograph showing the VE celebrations at the end. Three ladies, one of whom is my Aunt , she is the centre one with a flag in each hand. What is the uniform she is wearing?
No comedians please. Officer on parade.
My cousin, Cy Enfield directed this film. Great to learn about Sgt. Bourne. Adds some additional personality. I shall be loading up my copy to watch again!
One of my favorite movies. Unfortunately they haven't shown it on TV in many many years. I always watched it when it was on TV. Probably seen it 10 to 15 times
All right, nobody told you to stop working.
An interesting video. One point regarding C/Sgt Bourne’s account of Rorkesdrift highlighted in the video; you can listen to it on YouTube and it is actually read by Bourne’s grandson.  Bourne makes the point, in his account, that the Zulus who attacked the mission station used the rifles seized earlier from the men of the 24th Foot killed at Isandhlwana.  This is incorrect. As the “History Man” correctly states, the Zulus who attacked Rorkesdrift were not the same men who attacked Isandhlwana. The former were from Impis who had been kept in reserve.  So even an eye witness to the conflict can get things wrong!
Enjoyed your info immensely! Thank you!!
Thanks for that beautiful story. The career of a man in the British Army in an important time in history related perfectly.
So very, very well done. What a remarkable man, Colour Sergeant and Lieutenant Colonel Frank Bourne.....
Thank you for a great video. This was very entertaining and informative, about a very superb man.
Nice report.   Thanks!!
Thanks for the Video I had no idea he was was only 5 foot 3 😄
"Mr. Witt, sir? Be quiet now, will you? There's a good gentleman"
Great Man. We could do with him today, but in London !!!
"Button that tunic"
He was a proud example of bravery and pose during an incredibly challenging situation. He seemed like a man who commanded respect from his soldiers. His soldiers probably never wanted to let him down and strived to earn his respect.
0:59 Can you identify the medals on Bourne?  A wonderful video on this subject, and well do I remember Nigel Green's portrayal of Colour Sargent Frank Bourne.
The man had a yard of guts, and sounded like a humble man.
dies one day after VE Day. Probably so he could invade Hell and bayonet Hitler up the ass. What an absolute gallant warrior, scholar, gentleman, and hero.
There is a blue plaque dedicated to Frank Bourne at 16 Kings Hall Rd. Beckenham
“Do up your tunic.” They have thousands of Zulus about to come at them and here he telling his men to dress proper for battle because it’s what real soldiers do.
Wow! This is a great historical narrative. Sgt. Bourn stands out as on of the great sergeants of all times and perhaps the only one who eventually retired as a Lt. Colonel! What a life!
Outstanding material…
Thank you for this, very well done!
Well done
The good old BBC . Where would we be without them.
Colour Sergeant Bourne may have only stood 5'3", but in the annals of history, he is a giant among men.
"Drunk as a Lord"
I watched the film 20 years ago on video in Zululand together with a niece of Trevor Manuel.
Stumbled across this video and really enjoyed it. Expected that I would have give it a couple of minutes but watched until the end. How I wish the interview with him had not been deleted Thank you
Total respect to an amazing man 🍻
No co medians please!!
Can you provide a link to that interview?  Would love to read it.
They must have been amazing times to live and serve in the British army. Bravery and or courage or naivety. Alternatively was the army a means of seeing the world and getting off the land? Certainly the aristocracy assuming the right to lead me into war and death,when all they knew was wealth and privilege. The  colour sergeants  where real leaders
Thanks ever such for the history behind the man that I so admired as a boy. I admire him even more now thanks to you wonderful research of his life and his lifetime contributions to his country.  Sincerely and respectfully,  Tim Ouellette Pennsylvania, USA
Fascinating Thanks
Cracking video!
Brilliant video, brother.
Great video 👍👍 Thank you
Always remain staunch lads.
The real hero? Why the 577-450 Martini Henry of course. Hands down.
Very powerful.  Thank you for posting this!
I heard that the two officers in charge were not any good, it was the others who did what was needed.
I always wonder what happened to the men and women who were part of the extraordinary events in mankind’s history! Thank you for this video of a brave soldier!
wow  fabulous facts   ,   thanks so much
Man …. I’m laughing…. What a dude color sergeant was … and should have received more than just  a VC …what a wonderful man 🙏
What a splendid fellow! Avery interesting video, as usual.  One thing I didn’t quite get though; you said that after the battle he was offered  a Victoria Cross or a commission, but turned down the commission. So what happened to the Victoria Cross?
Superb and fascinating. One of Frank Bourne's lines from Zulu, ' I was asleep, Sir'...hero to the last, what an amazing life too.
Great video, thankyou. So, how did 'Tommy Atkins' become adopted as the stereotype British soldier?
Great story...thanks. I've remarked below that we need to be able to remember and celebrate such men for their individual virtues and character and not let today's perspective on colonialism dim our view of them. My paternal G-Grandfather was a SM in the Royal Scots Greys. My maternal G-Grandfather (Ayrshire Yeomanry) fought and died in the Boer wars in South Africa ( fortunately for me, his son was born before he died in battle) These men and all of our ancestors need to be recognized for their accomplishments as individuals and how their influence shaped the following generations man by man (or woman of course).
Now be a good fellow
Fantastic narrative !! Thank you !!
The fools that contemplated and started the Zulu war are more or less forgotten, but the VC's and soldiers like Frank Bourne are among those we remember and are most proud.  I see no paradox in revering our squadies and their NCO's, while reviling the Lords and Dukes who put them in harms way.  One of the most fascinating days I have ever spent, was at Isandlwana and Rorke's drift, with a bunch of ZA friends and a proper historical guide.  That poor man had to keep talking all day, we asked so many questions.  A truly memorable day I shall never forget.
I have the DVD even though I must of watched it a dozen times when I was a kid. My all time favorite battle movie.
Brilliant film, actors and music and narration by Richard Burton. I too saw it in the sixties and like another post here  the quote ... 'Zulus to the south east- -thousands of them' stood out. Delivered by that great actor Nigel Greene in a nonchalant factual manner. Chilling but superb.
You mentioned the quote I was gonna use. That has always been my favorite, "with some guts behind it."
Do a segment on Optelic in 2003. The invasion of Iraq.
Colour Sergeant Bourne: Hitch... Hitch, I saw you. You're alive.  Pvt. Hitch: I am? Oh, thanks very much.
Just discovered you fantastic thanks
A great memorable film with great cast!
Genuinely 🙏 Awesome nonpartisan truthful representation of history 👍👍
Someone needs to make a film about Bourne as an individual. Do any of his descendants still live in England?
He is the very model of the modern Colour Sargent to Lieutenant Colonel.
"Say, 'Sir.' Officer on parade."
Man what a man!  He lived an incredible life.  He was a credit to the British Empire and the British Army.  Loads of respect to the people of the Victorian Era.
Me and my roommate two nights ago had a discussion on Color Sergeant Borne. The movie myth versus reality. Thanks for the video.
Yeah, But what about the attacks by Tigers........In Africa widely reported by British Officers.
Typical of the BBC to destroy those tapes.
Thank you for telling us this amazing life story of such a brave man.
That was really good to listen to. What an accomplished soldier he was. Big respect to colour sergeant Bourne. Many thanks
It is good that these stories are told. We get too soft, too prone to whining and complaining. Everyone wants to be a hero until there is hero work to be done.
great video. How can I get a copy of the transcript of Lt Col Bourne's interview with the BBC in 1936?
Hi History Chap, my favourite line from this movie is "Mr. Dewitt sir, be quiet now will you, there's a good gentleman!"
Informative and 'era correct' in your approach to explain the 'mystery' behind no VC for the 'Color Sergeant.  As a retired and miltary service connected 'disabled' senior non-commissioned officer, I recognized his 'award' in his words you quoted.  His men were a direct reflection of his 'leadership qualities and influence in their welfare and care. That is every NCO's 'award'.  Done successfully, they are enabled to continue their military careers and receive further promotions to higher positions of responsibility in troop leadership.  As a fairly new but 'novice' on British history, particularly that of 'The Raj' and the East India Company and it's 'colonization' of India.  I've learned a lot about British demeanor, attitudes and expectations projected through those who fought the several 'tribes' and then those who begat the India Civil Service, in their own image.  Even from the begining, these 'attitudes' and expectations' were projected in achieving what they sought most.  English trade in India.  'The Color Sergeant' was trained by this tradition that went back to days before his own birth.  These were the days of 'Empire'.  Days that the sun never set on the British Empire.   I should think that the fears that plagued the 'The Raj', dealing with perceived threats to it's 'commerce' from the Russians would make EXCELLENT subject matter. As this lasted from the early 18th century, up through the Afhan Massacres, the Indian Mutiny, there will be plenty of 'history' to be related into several chapters/videos.  My interest in 'The Raj' stemmed from US President Joe Bidens' sudden 'surrender' in Afghanistan.  I'd earlier read a book given to me by my brother, then in the US Department of State, Peter Hopkirk's 'The Great Game: The Struggle for Empire in Central Asia.  I'd remembered the massacres and determined I needed to 'refresh' my memory and now 'understand why'.. Essentially The British, The Russians, and The Americans have all 'been there' and done that with varying degrees of success, short term or long term.  My desire to understand this 'dynamic' led me to Lawrence James's 'The Raj'; and subsequently to this comment about the famous 'Color Sergeant'.
Pershore Abbey?! I’m from Pershore, immigrated to Canada in 1998. My Mum and best mate still live there, and my family mainly still live in Worcestershire.
My friend met one of the man who's ancestry fought at Rourke's Drift. In their conversation he told my friend that all  survivors and their male children have dreams of that battle. . According after the battle the Witch Doctor put a curse on the survivors and their male children.
This is my first, but definitely not last, visit to your channel, thank you very very much for sharing the story of Colour Sgt Bourne, obviously a soldier’s soldier, who did not shirk his duty for anyone or anything, I would have loved to hear his radio interview but I will definitely read the transcript. Thanks again. 😀👍🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇺🇦 P.S I don’t know if he is on your list but I would really enjoy hearing your take on either Douglas Bader or Johnny Johnson, both RAF heroes of WWII Battle of Britain and beyond. Thanks.
One of my favorite all-time movies. Quite intense. Nigel Green, as always, superb performance. And of course, introducing Michael Caine.
RELOAD!!!
This made me think of my great grandfather (father's side of the family) who was also a Victorian soldier. Don't know a huge amount about him, but the contrast to Colour Sergeant Bourne couldn't have been more different. A Dubliner and total madman by all accounts. Shot in the behind on some campaign, he did make sergeant, but was busted down to private fob being drunk and disorderly while commanding the guard in Gibraltar. All on my G'father's side were British Army men, One John Doyle took part in the Charge of the Light Brigade, 8th Hussars, his horse was shot from under him and he walked back through the valley with his saddle and accoutrements according to the role call taken next morning.
Yes Sir . The gentleman has a bottle.
Where is Frank buried
Zulus sah,fousands of’em.
“Alright lads.  Nobody told you to stop workin’.”
I say,who said you could use my men, They were stood around doing nothing.  Rather you asked next time old boy,do carry on with your mud pies
The thing most interesting about Bourne was how young he was. He was obviously a very promising soldier to have become a colour sergeant so early. He was already recognised as one of the the best noncoms in the army. The version I heard was that he was offered the VC but asked for a commision at some point in the future, which he did receive, ending as a Colonel. The fate of some of the VC winners was far more tragic.
Thank you for this. I'm full of admiration to hear he became a Lot C
I’d love to meet the compete moron who threw the interview recording out of the BBC archive
Liked and subscribed. Excellent
Been to the battlefields many times,never loses its appeal .Be quite thers a good gentleman, you 'll upset the lads.
Excellent..
Why am I NOT surprised at the BBC’s view on military history being unimportant.
A fascinating life, Lt Col.
Start sweating !
The British crown should have at least paid Bourne for the wheelbarrow he must have used to transport his Ka-Jones.
I am a retired U.S. Army officer.  I always held that Colour Sergeant Bourne was the ideal example of what an NCO should be.  I'm glad to finally know the "rest of the story".
theres a good fellow
👍🇬🇧
"Someone at the BBC binned the script (of the last survivor of Rourke's Drift) as they saw it had no intrinsic value". I never knew the woke rot went so far back.
VALOR was/“IS” the epitome of the British Army of those times and ours…They rank among the best is the world along with their Canadian and American Allie’s…None better unless you count India’a Sepoy ….Gallantry Is there middle name….
Fantastic thanks for sharing with us
Button your tunic! where do you think you are man?!
Does anyone know where Frank Bourne is buried please???
Came up as a “recommend” in my feed. First time visitor now a subscriber.
let's face it the awarding of high honors in any army are more likely to go to Officers then EM in proportion to #'s there off.  I see nothing that either officer in this case did that like colour sgt that was not just what their job description said.  Thus like the Sgt should not of gotten the awards they did.
Brilliant!!
Excellent video. Thank you, sir.
What a great story . unbelievable career of atcheivment. Thanks for telling it.
Fascinating.
Professional dedicated and selfless. An example to us all.
Fantastic appraisal.... Thank you.
Very interesting, real stuff.👍👍👍🇬🇧
“Get up that hill you stupid Welshman”  😂👌🇬🇧👍
"Be a good gentleman and die quietly Sir"😊 Nigel Green was one of England 's most underrated actors and your viewers should check out two more epic films he starred in. These are "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight", a brilliant film which I personally believe will never be improved upon it is always going to be the go to version and "Let's Kill Uncle" a very black comedy with a story not dissimilar to "Night of the Hunter".  Robert Mitchum was great playing the villain but Nigel Green can menace and intimidate with the demeanor of the most efficient psychopath and the cut-glass English accent just adds to the constant threat emanating from one of the best movie villains of all time.  Thanks for covering one of my favourite characters and the genius who played him. They just don't make them like that any more.
Thank you for this story behind the man - a real person who served our country in the best traditions, in one of the most famous battles (among hundreds!).
NCO's were the backbone of the army and Bourne a most splendid example. Of course they had to hire a giant of a man to play his role on film to represent of his larger-than-life actions. Fascinating story and his training no doubt saved the lives of many hundreds or thousands of English soldiers in the first World war. I am curious as to what is the name of that piece of music you use as intro/ending music?
A VC is an award for an individual act of bravery. The DCM is more appropriate for distinguished conduct over an extended period of time. It's an award that says volumes about him as an NCO.  It's probably worth noting that no senior NCO in his right mind would want to become a junior officer.  Particularly given the need at that time for a private income.  Even today, I don't think any decent NCO would want a commission. Sergeants, as a men know, have a clue. Ruberts (junior officers) don't.
i find it fascinating that he was offered the VC an turned it down, clearly he perhaps felt that he did not deserve such credit, the fact that he was given a pension identical to that of the recipients and offered a comission shows that his seniors felt that he more than qualified, as evidenced by his serving his country right up until his second retirement. An amazing man
The whole episode of Lord Chelmsfords handling of the Zulu war was an embarrassment for the Government, especiallly after news of the Islandwana massacre came out. What better way to divert attention away from the Govt mishandling ( or so it was viewed even though Chelmsford had  disobeyed orders from the govt) than to create 12 super heroes from Rorkes Drift.
I was always interested in the Zulu Wars. Nice to see what happened to one of the battle's most distinguished soldier. As for the interview in 1936, a typical bureaucrat's ignorance and oversight destroyed destroyed a valuable historical record. I would have likes to have listened to his voice. Great video. As for Nigel Green, always played very well in military roles and his portrayal is very much on point even if he was a foot taller than the original character since you can say that  Color Sergeant Bourne was large than life anyway.
who would want to face that mutton chopped... A 6'9" 400 lb Zulu with an  ”Iklwa” cut to his size of same age and experience
Thank you for your video.  It's great to hear about the true life of Colour Sergeant Bourne, a  remarkable man from humble origins.
there was a really good play about this i think on the radio years back.
Well done sir, well done.
I share the same surname as Frank Bourne, I would like to think we may be related but I really have no idea. Fantastic film anyway. And those men deserve the medals that were given out for their service. I still think we have one of the best Armies in the world.
Great series much enjoyed. How about Kut Al Amara. Several of our local dead were captured or were in the actions to relieve the besieged garrison.
He’s been my hero for decades. Professional,  calm, total strength of character. Each time we watch it I say WHY DIDN’T HE GET A MEDAL TOO? At least he got the DCM and an annuity.
Officer on parade
Do you know about a soldier named McGovern in the bore war he earned a VC God bless from Canada eh!
Great video! Continuing along the VC theme, how about you do a video on Noel Chavasse VC & Bar?
Thank you for telling the story of this amazing man. He honours all soldiers everywhere by his example.
An excellent video about a remarkable man!
"Outpost reports Zulus to the south thousands of em!"
love the film. but the real story is even more amazing.
Buried in Elmer's end private cemetery.
What most people don't know is that Lieutenant Bromhead was almost totally deaf, had a huge beard and moustache (As most soldiers did in those days) and the officers had to purchase their own pistols, instead of being issued with them. My late grandfather was an army orphan/sutler's boy/bugler attached to a Royal Navy detachment that enfiladed a Zulu Kraal at the same time as Rourke's Drift was being attacked. He was stabbed in the stomach by two Zulus with asegais, survived, went on to fight in both Boer Wars and the First World War, and tried to re-enlist in the British Army at the start of WW2, but was deemed too old, which he raged about for quite a while, according to my father, who was called up for duty in 1939. My dad always said my grandfather would rather die fighting than in bed, and he did, as he was also an Army bare knuckle boxing champion, and continued fighting bouts privately long after he retired from the Army, and had his last fight the day he died. They just don't seem to make men like these anymore :-) My grandfather was born in the back of an army wagon, was raised by the Army, and missed his life among his comrades in arms long after he was forced to retire from the army in the 1920's. I remember watching Zulu and Zulu Dawn over the years, and read the wonderful book "The Washing Of The Spears" about what really happened during the Anglo-Zulu Wars, and the movie showed Private Hook wrongly, as he was one of the bravest men at Rourke's Drift, and later became a Colour Sergeant himself, and it was his character that they based Colour Sergeant Bourne on for the movie :-) I still love both movies, and watch them often. The later stories of those brave men are even more interesting than most people think, as many of them went on to have even more adventures in their careers as soldiers, and after they left the army.
Very well put together sir , tho' I contend the ZULU's were not actually defeated they walked away , were they ever defeated as a nation ? I thought it odd that Nelson Mandela was first president of South Africa , when he was a Nomad , shouldn't it have been one of the ZULU tribe (true South African tribe) maybe a Buthelezi ? your thoughts ?
No one should be “awarded” for killing someone
"A prayer is as good as a bayonet at a time like this" one of my fav quotes
British Soldiers are second to none, Rule Britannia from Glasgow. 😎 🇬🇧
A time when men were men and women were women
Good video, thanks.
An astonishing life.
Nice presentation, thanks 👍
Is there somewhere that I could find out a bit more about what became of my g,g, grandfather in 1917? I haven't been able to find out much at all, other than his regiment number.
thank you
Have you done the campaigns of the Duke of Marlborough yet?
Pershore Abbey in the background!
Was Hooky a real character ?
BBC doing what always do and ditching our history for their own versions even then.
I saw this movie in the Natick drive in in 64 when I was 10  great movie  Bourne  should have been awarded the Vc for holding that unit together
Just found your channel and a great bit of history thanks 😊 Fred
I just came here to know what a "Colour Sergeant" is... Some one in charge of a lot of colours? Someone managing what colours the army uses?
I remember watching that when it came out, I was twelve, I loved it. I have watched it twice since,it’s still good ! the tension was beautifully built up with the sound of the marching Zulu impis approaching.
It seems that this lad is exactly what the Russian army lacks I'm told
I found this history of such a wonderful person riveting.
He retired and lived near me in Penge... that's what happened to him 😁 He has a blue plaque, 16 Kings Hall Road, BR3 1LU
Donald.  May I please suggest something on the 40th Foot in the Napoleonic Campaigns. One of only three British Regiments to serve throughout these and retook ( along with 30th Foot ) La Haye Sainte having been rushed from Ireland to Waterloo. An ancestor of mine served throughout and was a Colour Sergeant in the Regiment and  was involved in 13 battles plus Waterloo: William Vile who enlisted in 1803 at 15.
Nicely done, however you left out one important information. Where is he buried.
Thank you
Excellent documentary, thanks you🙂
Marvellous! I loved Nigel Green's portrayal of him in Zulu.
Can’t remember who quotes this but my favourite from this film is “we got at least 60” “that leaves only 3940”
What a guy
Guts, not heroism, that is the real Bourne. Backbone of the company indeed.
That was great. He was a giant of a man.
Hook, I saw you, answer your name!
I saw this on telly growing up and loved the winning against superior numbers. Liked the Stanley Baker character and the colour sargeant. Liked the hymn singing. Liked the first rank, fire, second rank fire but at the same time I always liked the Zulus. I didn't understand colonialism or politics as a kid but knew it wasn't fair. It was their land. They were impressive though. Great songs, chanting,  bravery and shield thumping. I like that the Brits won (survived) but ive felt respect for Zulus ever since.
Unknown Heroes or sometimes little known Heroes stories are quite fascinating! You should do more of these!
Thank you for this video sir! Thoroughly enjoyed watching it and you answered something I had wondered about. Looking forward to seeing more of your videos!
Great video
The best book about the Zulu wars is 'The washing of the spears'.
Well Done, Very Well Done Inspirational AND Educational! What a guy, such HUMILITY and such COURAGE! Outdone yourself. Bravo!
Thank you ! Inspiring and humbling. So good to hear the stories of men who took their responsibility for their comrades and the task at hand.
Very interesting video on our history nice video.
I watched Zulu with my dad when i was a kid and loved it. I read everything about the anglo/Zulu war after that. Thx dad👍🏻
Great presentation. I have read that King George VI served at the Battle of Jutland and was a member of "the 20 minute club" (RFC). But there's not much about that. Is it possible to dig and find what he actually did?
Let's hear something about the commissioned British officers who volunteered in the Prussian army during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870
Great vid revealing the afterlife of a popular icon
Make some videos about the War of Austrian Succession
Brilliant history lesson and what a fantastic soldier thank you, I personally love his roll call at the end of the film. The raid on Nazaire in WW2 would be a good one!
Excellently executed!
Thank you so much for  this very enjoyable and informative video I think Nigel Green made the picture for me I have  watched it many times thanks again
Six pennies? Sixpence please. Three pennies? Thrupence please. Apart from my pedantic numismatic comments, a brilliant video, entertaining and educational, quite a rare production on Utube.
Brilliant!!
A great Victorian hero and man of many adventures, Frederick Burnaby would be an ideal subject for one of your videos...
I didn’t know he lived through 2 world wars
Fire at the smoke
As an ex Natalian, it was very interesting visiting these sites as a teenager.  Many others were there.  Little outposts in Zululand on the tops of Koppies (hills).  There were little military cemeteries with regimental graves.  They were completely untended then.  Grown over.  I heard many were later disturbed / robbed for tunic buttons, etc.  Very sadly!  Almost all of the soldiers died of disease.  As was mainly the case all over colonial Africa and Asia. Probably only a minority fell in combat.
My favorite line from the Colour Sgt Bourne “ answer sir, Officer on parade”
I have actually fired a Martini-Henry rifle. It was, and still is, not a very pleasant experience. For those soldiers to have maintained any sort of rate of fire  was amazing. After about 20 rounds the barrel would have started to become very hot and would also have started to become quite foul. Given that 100-odd soldiers fired off about 20,000 rounds of "reserve" ammunition, that's over 260 rounds each counting the 60 rounds per man of normal use cartridges, that's a heck of a lot of fouling. No wonder the Zulu casualties were on the low side.
my god what would he make of these snowflakes today,
"There's a good gentleman"
"Alright then! Nobody told you to stop working! You lead backsided... get sweating"
British History is replete with such men.   Guy Gibson is another that springs to mind. Johnson Beharry and so many more.  Its quite humbling.
Do your tunic up lad
Well now I'm going to have to watch the film again! An amazing story.
My favourite from the film isn't what he says, it's at the badly wounded (possibly dying Hitch asks to 'undo his buttons now please sarge'. Very moving scene for me the tenderness in that scene
Great video thank you, Colour Sergeant Bourne is indeed one of my heros although I am not a Brit, I can recognise valour elsewhere, thank you sir indeed.
Sir your videos bring tears to my eyes..due to the often sad loses...but mainly due to the pride in our military forces and history..thank you.
Great video Chris. Perhaps a story or two on the incredible logistics of warfare. By all means pick a period (Medieval, middle ages, Vikings, US civil war, WW1, WW2 to keep it simple...). I saw a quote somewhere that no empire could match the logistical effectiveness of the Assyrian Empire right up until the US civil war and it's use of railroads. I found this factoid fascinating... Just an idea mate.
A full life well lived.
“ADVAAAANCE!”
Hinch I've seen you, you're alive. Now get off to sick bay where you belong.
My favourite comment was Bourne to a soldier on the ramparts, ' DO YOUR TOP BUTTON, LAD, WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?'
how accurate was the actual dialogue used in the film anyway? is it not just open to interpretation of the scripwriter? so no matter how burly and cute the written dialogue is in the movie there is no way to know what was actually said.
The BBC binned the interview, how many more national treasures are being destroyed by the self appointed regulator's of British culture the BBC. Surely a national archive should take control of all BBC film and digital record's they are not to be trusted, with precious record's, of our past. These record's do not belong to the BBC they belong to the nation.
My favorite Colour Sergeant Bourne quote is "Zulus to the Southwest - thousands of 'em"
Wonderful video exploring the unforgettable character that Nigel Green portrayed in the Battle of Rorke's Drift, Zulu! Frank Bourne was an extraordinary soldier, and the men were lucky to have him there for his leadership during the battle. Thanks for producing this retelling of history. In the movie, I like the exchange that Bourne has with the preacher when they're getting bags of grain out to build fortifications and he recites the Psalms. I love history. <subscribed>
Amasing...aussies had there own rorkes drift i n vietnam...they fought of a whole battalion  of regular nva army...they inflicted massive casualties   to the nva ...and like at rorkes drift lost only 17 men .....its one of australias   greatest battlesv
Unfortunately Stanley Baker turned the film into as advert for Wales, inferring that the regiment was Welsh, when it was in fact a border regiment. Quote: "I don't know what they'll do to the French, but by God they frighten me!"
very informative , thank you. Anyone know where is Frank Bourne buried?
I think an interesting subject for a video would be Sir William Robertson, CIGS in WW1 and the only man to have held every rank in the Army from private to Field Marshall.
I would like to see an account of the battle of Quebec - General Wolfe ordered his troops to ascend the Heights of Abraham, easy to type, but a task that would seem almost impossible, even today.  Once done, the 35th of foot, faced the elite French Rousillon Regiment on the right of the line, and basically, slaughtered them.  The 35th of foot...'the orange lilys', became the 1st Battalion Royal Sussex, who would later become the 3rd Battalion The Queen's Regiment, in which I served.  The 35th of foot (featured in the film 'The last of the Mohicans' ) had previous history with the French, and were determined to take revenge on the French for the betrayal featured in that film. I would very much like to hear more about this battle and the role of the 35th, as I don't think it's been done.
What a life! “ you’re not dead you’re alive” “ oh thank you colour Sargent” “ its sir, officer on parade”
I knew I man that met him in 1940
That was wonderful.  Thank you. From Richmond CA, USA where Kaiser built the Victory class ships of the Pacific War.
They don't like it up em.
Typical bbc binning history seems to have carried on to this day.
I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth. The LORD of hosts is with us
I would like you to do a video about 155 Battery at Sidi Nsir 1943. Or K Battery at Hondeghem 1940
I read somewhere only a few years ago that Stanley Baker became very much interested in the character he played in the movie "Zulu" - Lt Chard VC - and ended up possessing Chard's VC.
The Gentleman has a bottle Sir.
The BBC at it again. Erasing Dr Who and the Avengers is one thing, now we're finding out they've been erasing History, what Nitwits.
History was always a boring subject dry ;lifeless written by the Victors bemoaned and denied by the vanquished; when a lady friends son was given the subject to research and prepare I tried to give him the background knowledge Bloody queen Marys determination to restore the Roman Catholic Church to Protestant England; Her failed Marriage to the Catholic King of Spain and the result of having Syphilis and unable to have children ;the difference in the 3 navies (FRANCE :SPAIN ;England ) the composition  of English sailors to Spanish Soldiers manning the larger Galleons and their cannons; Drake and Frobisher had their" New" cannons loaded with "heated Shot " which skipped when it hit the water and caused fires in the hulls of Spanish ships igniting the powder charges  also because of the stronger barrels the English could use "Chain Shot".  After weeks of research I gave him my material to copy in the hope he would for once Get a Good Mark; what did he do ? he wrote 5 lines with the date ;the name of the Spanish King and Queen Elizabeth i   and the names of Drake and Frobisher, none about the key factors; last time I ever tried to help him.  ps my family name is D'BEER from my gran,s side, and Boers originally.
In the picture u showed with Michael Cane they were using Lee Enfield rifles! Its clearer to see in the film. Prob didnt have enough martini Henry?
thanks for the upload.I watched ZULU at the cinema when it first came out and at 76 years young its still my favourite film.keep up the good work and again ..thank you for the upload
Thank you for this interesting and informative video.  Although I was legally adopted out of the family I am related, by blood, to Frank Bourne.
Jeff Cooper writes of a heroic fight where the Zulus are trying to come in the back door of the hospital. An officer told a private--"Hold that door"--Yes Sir!! With fixed bayonet he killed 16 Zulus in single combat before being overcome due to exhaustion after which he was killed. Instead of entering the hospital the Zulus stepped back and performed a king of brief "dance" which they used to honor a particularly worthy adversary and then poured into the building. This is not shown in the movie.
‘Say sir!, Officer on parade.
He should be given a victoria cross!
"Hitch, do your tunic up" "Me tunic?" "Do it up! Where do you think you are man!"
Hitch... Hitch, I saw you. You're alive.
At 5’ 3”……but what a GIANT of a man!
Nobody told you stop working ... A fav of mine .
Reality was more interesting than fiction.
Wonderful insight to a true real life hero. Credit to him & your great video.
Nigel Green , as colour sergeant Bourne … to a drunk Mr Witt, ( Methodist minister I think ) … be quiet Mr Witt , there’s a good chap . At this time in the film , a drunk Methodist minister was , spouting that “ thou shalt not kill” , and be thy brother’s  keeper .. etc , in these perhaps more religious times, it was starting to upset the troops !! CS Bourne ,though instead of rifling off an command ,  to shut up… came up with a respectful line above , appealing to the minister . I also believe he , said when asked by Lt Bromhead ,what’s that noise …. 20,000 Zulu’s to the southwest …. Great Film ,put Micheal Caine and the Drakensberg moutains on the map ! This was our imperialist past , something that Now appears somewhat anachronistic , as Russia invades the Ukraine . Thanks for your video’s Chris , thought the backdrop had a similarity to the Cotswolds .
Fascinating story.  Enjoyed the video.  New Sub.  Thank you.  Reid.  Dallas, Texas, USA.
At a time of Brexit haters maybe a remake of the battle if Trafalgar would be an idea !!!
It would be nice to here about other fine British fighting men of all the home nations but for me it would be nice to here about welsh men god bless all the fine British fighting men and women
"What's that firing?"   "A rifle, Hughes."
This movie sparked an interest in British and military history when I saw it at 10 years old , I'm now on 16 years service in 2 armies and not planning on stopping anytime soon . 🇳🇿🇺🇲
My grandfather was in the south welsh borders in the battle of the Somme and received a MM
Psalm 46 V10 .  Still gives me goosebumps from the film
excellent!
As usual Sir you did not disappoint. Brilliant mini documentary and narrative. Kudos!
Chris Morning, Really enjoyed this one, great research and enthusiasm!  - Bourne's comments to the Padre "Mr. Witt sir... be quiet now will you, there's a good gentleman, you'll upset the lads." - It encapsulates the very essence of the recognition of a senior NCO, having to balance the discipline, brawn and brain over the delicacies of the Victorian class system - a well-constructed scene which tells us a lot about the challenges at that time for very capable individuals, but lovely to see he ended up as a half colonel and a CBE - possibly the best success story of the men of Rorkes Drift.  It would be interesting to know if his kids were able to escape the poverty/ class trap and entered British society with better prospects and where was he laid to rest?
As an American Infantryman I always viewed Color SGT Bourne as the epitome of the British NCO. Hard as nail and steady under pressure.
Australian Army Officer cadets at Duntroon during the seventies all watched the film as part of their training
What a great career and history. Thank you.
The early BBC had no sense of history.
Frank Bourne a real MAN !!!  Your description of his service brought him to life!  A hero lives on !!
It sounds like he was indeed a hero.
Jis this was great... thank you from South Africa
During rollcall, “Hitch…Hitch I saw you, you’re alive.” And Hitch’s response, “Oh, thank you very much.”  Classic
Excellent article, thank you.
Zulu's...thousands of 'em
The one I remember is when he says to a very drunk Jack Hawkins, ''Come along sir, there's a good Gentleman'' I could hear my father, an RSM, using a similar expression when dealing with young, errant, officers!
He was 5'3'' . Well i believe that a large person by stature does not have to fight like a smaller person  who others may see has an easier target. So the smaller person has to prove he can fight more often than the larger person.
"Hitch... Hitch, I saw you. You're alive..."
what and amazing story and extraordinary Soldier!  well done
What a great story!  I’m so happy to hear that the Color Sergeant was well recognized after the battle, and rose to such great heights later in his career!  What a man!  You are right!  One of the perfect examples of a Victorian British Soldier!
I saw you (can't remember the name) your alive! I am? Oh thanks very much..  No comedians please...  One of the best lines...
How about giving accounts, of the three men, who each were awarded two VC's each, all RAMC personnel too
A great video!  My favorite lines are Bourne reporting quietly to Chard, “Zulus Sir. Thousands of them.’
Could you do a battle timeline of the Highland 42nd The Black Watch Reg
One of the finest soldiers of all time and one must wonder whether he would have made Major General had he accepted that commission when first offered. So, he served in the Zulu War, the  Burmese campaign, WW1 and died at the end of WW2 One must wonder how he saw the 'march' of civilisation. Another point is that the impi that attacked Rorkes Drift specifically disobeyed a direct order from King Cetewayo that it was not to be attacked. His interview would have been fascinating with this attention to smaller details such as piercing the mealy bags and rifle standards of the Zulus. I wonder if he had any observations on Chard and Bromhead and their defence tactics. Probably not as it was inappropriate for enlisted men to speak of their superiors.
I visited Rorkes Drift in 1996. Standing there and remembering the battle, sent shivers thro' me.
As an American I've heard & read of this battle years ago, but this tid-bit of history really brings another perspective to what I read. Well done and thanks.
Link to the BBC Magazine interview?
Hey Chris, I don't understand. You said at 8-50 that Bourne was offered a VC, or a commission, yet was 'only' given a DCM. Why was that? Also it was pretty slack and unpatriotic, that the now roughly 85 year old Frank Bourne, didn't try to join up for some sort of service in 1939. Unbelievable! :)
"Allll right then! No need to stop working!" -Color Sergeant Borne
Colour Sergeant Bourne : Hitch... Hitch, I saw you. You're alive. Pvt. Hitch : I am? Oh, thanks very much.
I’m Texan. Of Course we have the Alamo. But Zulus didn’t have any Artillery
What about covering the battles between the Scott's and the British
That’s a true Englishman🇬🇧
You're videos are delightful as are you. My family here is Italian American but we have a wonderful British connection as my Uncle Leo, serving in WW 2 met and married a Devon lass named Margaret who moved with him back a ross the pond after the war. She was a splendid addition to our family. She and my dear late mom were like sisters. As an extra bonus many of Aunt Margaret's British relatives came over to visit us for many years and  brought with them amazing joy, one more joyful than the other. They are all gone now but I have great affection for the people of your great nation and a love of British military history. I was alwa
Your tale of Borne is what must be an usual man to have had such an army career, stretching as you say from the height of the redcoat empire in 1879 to the trenches of 14-18, and finally the end of empire [ although few saw that at the time ] VE day1945. BTW the movie quote I like - apart from the already quoted " upsettin'; the lads " was " The man [ Witt ] has bottle Sir ".
Well done, Sir. Great video.
Very interesting thanks for the information, im a big fan of ZULU
When he is taking roll call after the battle and he says "No comedians please"
What a great tale.  A long time fan. Enjoyed your presentation.
All right, nobody told you to stop working, get sweating! It would be great to see you put one out next April 1st on Sir Harry Flashman KCB etc etc. That would be a treat!
I'm sorry ,, this bloke was not 5ft 3"  He was 10 ft tall , I guess one could say , he was a Soldiers Soldier . I joined the Australian Army in 1974 , and Zulu was the movie shown to all recruits , Discipline & Courage are just 2 things that make a SOLDIER .. He does deserve the VC. I think he lead by example .. aussie bob..🥇🥇🥇🍻🍻
Nigel Greene was superb in his role...Hard for me to imagine, how you can train an effective force of men, when they can neither read or write...God Bless...
great movie.
Bourne was a small man; just 5'6'' at the time of Rorke's Drift when he was 23 y.o.  Nigel Green who played him in ZULU was 6'4 '' and 39 y.o.
Color sergeant, so cool under fire, professional soldier, by the book.
https://youtu.be/B9hssXUg1s0
The quote that I remember, after the battle, the roll call. "Stand to attention lad!...........officer on parade". Authority when and where needed.
Amazing Video... Amazing man... Amazing movie, Well done.
"Button your tunic lad.  Don't forget where you are."
My late father was a Sergeant Major in the NZ Army during WW2, subsequently promoted to 2nd lieutenant in the army, and then became a Pilot Officer in the air force. He often used to comment that King George VI must have a sense of humour, calling him an Officer and a Gentleman not once but twice.
Favourite lines?   "Do that button up man...where d'you think you are!"  And... "Hitch?   Hitch..I saw you...you're alive"  (Answered with " Iam..Oh... thanks very much!" )
it still amzess me that one person lived though the end of the victorian ear up untill the end of the second world war, just make you wonder the events one will live though and even be part of in their lifetime.
“Your here...I have seen you...”
The Bourne Legacy?
Seems the army took care of him and he enjoyed serving , and a DSC and OBE is nothing to sniff at .
Great history.  Thanks for giving us the true story.  I've seen the movie perhaps three times in my 61 years, and it never fails to amaze.  My favorite line by Color Sergeant Bourne was when he politely chastised the drunken vicar "Mr Witt sir, be quiet now will you? There's a good gentleman. You'll upset the lads."
"Keep your voices down." When he's calling the roll at the end of the movie.
Excellent story.  For me, there has always been some sort of a mix-up in regards to our Commonwealth      VC recipients who were at the time the action, were seconded to, or joined directly into British units. Are they considered as a British or Commonwealth in the national lists? Slain te'🍻
Hitch... Hitch, I saw you. You're alive.
Thank you for this, I had always wondered about the story behind the Colour Sgt.
An excellent video! An excellent film! And an excellent soldier! I have always found him not being awarded the VC a curious affair. Are there any sources behind him "seemingly" being offered one, as mentioned in the video? If so I'd be very interested in seeing it.
The men of the 2nd Warwickshire Regiment.
I loved that movie; EXCEPT  the way they degraded the role of the minister, making him a drunk and a coward. The truth is acted bravely in the face of the death they all faced together. Hollywood never seems to tire of putting Christianity in a bad light.
Taking roll call post battle receiving no answer from a man "You're alive, I saw you"
Zulu is one of the greatest movies of all-time. It certainly is mine!
"Mr Witt sir, be quiet now will you? There's a good gentleman. You'll upset the lads."
Hitch…Hitch,I saw you. You’re alive.
5'3" Giant! What a tremendous story of stamina, courage and service!
First class, as ever.
I win—Zulus!
He died at 91 (astonishing for that time) and 1 day after V-Day? Someone was defiantly looking out for him.
Yes sir....the gentleman has a bottle.....
Cheers Chris, what a story and what a life. They don't make 'em like Frank any more.
Years ago Guns & Ammo Magazine had an article on Firearms with pics & places where a battle was fought. Some of the rock croppings pictured showed bullet splatters from what i believe it came from a Maxim. Poor Chaps, spring foward a 100 or so years later & the comunista Cuban Soldiers sent there, found out Africa is a very hostile place.
Hughes: “Color Sergeant Bourne, what’s the shooting?” CS Bourne: “A rifle Hughes”
Great stuff chap!...the British Award system has Allways been rather cumbersome what!. Something about Marlborough's siege of Lille would be brilliant thanks.
Loved the story you told!
Favorite quote while calling the roll at the end..."Hitch... Hitch, I saw you. You're alive."
"Now behave like a good gentleman"
My favourite piece of dialogue from Zulu is the following exchange immediately before the battle is about to start: Colour Sergeant Bourne: Face to the front. Mark the orders. Mark a target when it comes. (quietly to Private Hitch), do your tunic up. Private Hitch: My tunic? Bourne: Do it up! Where do you think you are, man?
I first saw Zulu when I was 12. Repeated viewings followed over the years. Now own a blu ray disc. The fact I instantly clicked upon you video shows how much the film & the greater story of Rorke’s Drift has become ingrained into my memory.
Enjoyed that immensely.  Thank you.
Not enough attention was given to the fact that the Zulu were disobeying their Orders in attacking Rorkes Drift and in taking the casualties slicked off back to their Karl without the loot and glamour they had anticipated.
Colour Sargeant Bourne the Jesus on the Job who created the 455 Martini Henry miracle on demand..  they say those who survived Islandewana and Roarkes drift all had to be carried out on stretchers.. their balls were too big to allow them to walk.. Mad Respect from a former US Marine
No comedians please...
Brilliant !!
I was shown this film as a youngster drafted into the Australian Army, we were all slotted to be fed into the Green Machine in Vietnam and that’s where most of us went.
So if he was offered the choice of either a VC or a Commision, but turned down the commision down for monetary reasons; what was the reason he turned down the VC?
I’ve the same complaint about the CSM for D Company at Long Tan in Vietnam.
I’ve not seen your video on the VC winners from Rorkes Drift, but I’ll bet you the ORs ended up poor, diseased and forgotten and the Officers ended up wealthy, healthy and lionised. The nature of the British society dictates that outcome.
May I suggest more on VC winners...?
I'd love to see a video about the 1st Afghan war. My understanding is that an army of several men marched into Kabul in 1839 and only 1 man made it out alive. He was named Brydon and was a surgeon.
The Shangani Patrol?
1) THANK YOU SO MUCH, for yet another EXCELLENT presentation of our rich & vibrant History… A History that deserves to be told by someone who fully appreciates it, as you do - & who succeeds in relating it with a very compelling degree of reverence & pathos expressed for those who played their part in it, combined with what is your signature hallmark - a very engaging & genial smile. 😁  2) For all of the above reasons, your Channel really does deserve a much larger viewership & I sincerely hope that it continues to grow apace, so that many others can properly appreciate the hard work & diligent research that you put into preparing & compiling every episode & the rich History that you bring to life in the way that you relate it.  3) Speaking of APPRECIATING OUR HISTORY… One sincerely hopes that whichever BBC CLOWN 🤡 & utter PHILISTINE 🤨 was responsible for DESTROYING Colour Sergeant Bourne’s PRICELESS recorded account of his experiences at Rorke’s Drift, was stood in front of a wall & executed by a Firing Line drawn from the ranks of the many Marksmen trained by Colour Sergeant Bourne. 🤦🏻‍♂️
One of the best films ever made.  And the portrayal of the Sargent was genius.   Great film, great actor.
Hi Chris you mentioned the Anuity for receiving a medal IE> VC . GC. GM. in particular the GM as when I was at School in Hampshire a boy was awarded the GM for saving another child who fell through the ice in one of the Ponds at Osterley Park in about 1953/4. I have often wondered what the scale of payment was for this Medal. Thanks for all the detail that you put into your Channel .
Sad we can't hear his voice (bloody bbc)
I watched zulu one night with my Sargeant at cop Keating Afghanistan, the morning after we were surrounded and nearly overrun by a force 10 times our number.  I haven't watched it since.
Say SIR!  officer on parade .
Is there a procedure for review VC awards ?  We have that in the USA for MOH awards.
So THAT'S where Jason Bourne got his balls...
So often have I thought about that action,and wondered about the Colour Sergeant. Really glad he was decorated and his bravery recognised. Never forgotten the "Because we're 'ere,lad." I am also glad the film took the opportunity to praise the bravery of the Zulus who were fighting for their land. Even Winston Churchill asked about them one day. I recall the noise when the Zulus were approaching,as if a train were coming,the spears beating on the shields. To the few men there,that sound must have been terrifying,as they were in a land so strange and alien and hostile,with no hope of rescue or relief. Victoria Crosses were definitely earned that day.
My fav quote was when he was facing that Zulu and he didn't know how many shots he'd fired: "You Were Only Supposed To Blow The Bloody Doors Off!!" - ah, classic Sergeant Bourne. 😎👍
My Dad took me to see this film when I was about 4 or 5 years old, He was a Royal engineer and he loved this movie. Did they ever finish the bridge construction?
Great story, thank you, my favourite saying by Colour Sergeant Bourne was "Now sir, be a good gentleman and be quiet, you're upsetting the lads."  The type of conversation in Victorian times between someone from a lower working class background to somebody from the middle classes i.e. a man of the cloth, a vicar.
"I will be exalted among the heathen. I will be exalted in the earth. The Lord of Hosts is with us."
Magnificent performance of Nigel Green.
All right then nobody told you to stop working,  get sweating
"Thats it..that's a good gentleman"
Can you do a video about the battle of Hlobane mountain
Nigel Green and Michael Caine were versatile actors, whose screen interactions shone light on each other’s characters in memorable ways. I particularly enjoyed Green’s portrayal as a “passed-over Major” trying to contend with the cynical, cockney flippancy of Caine’s Harry Palmer in “The Ipcress Files”, made shortly after “Zulu”.  Also, thank you for taking the time to research and broadcast the life story of the real Frank Bourne, who, it now seems, was a noble fellow whose deeds deserve to be acknowledged.
He’s buried in Beckenham cemetery…I visited his grave many years ago …may he R.I.P
"Say Sir, officer on parade..." and "Hitch I SAW you, you're alive..."
Great content! Zulu (and not bothering to nit pick) remains a firm favourite, having grown up in Kenya and Zambia. What else would I like hear more about? Siege and Relief of Chitral? India has been a constant source of interest. Robert Clive, Plassey, Assaye, the Sikh Wars,  the North West frontier and the Sepoy Mutiny, Cawnpore and Lucknow. Stories of immense courage, impressive individuals, tragedy and often horror.
Very informative and enjoyable short video.  Love to hear more about the only survivor of the long retreat from Kabul in the 1st Anglo-Afghanistan war.
Trained my grand father in Dublin 1914, who survived  the war , of course.
A good recap of a solid soldier, just doing his job.  In my humble opinion, the British military hierarchy was so embarrassed over the disaster inflicted at Isandlwana that the Rorke's Drift battle and the subsequent awarding of medals, took the minds off the public and gave the military cover.
Nigel green died quite young .
Excellent video about Frank.
Useless  BBC  throwing away such important  British history  !
What a colorful life and dedicated man to his service for his country. Thanks for giving this perspective of such an amazing man. We only see the short films or scripts and never hear about the end game. He was truly a warrior and survivor. I am sure there are many just like him forgotten in history who have some amazing stories to tell. Please keep doing this
5' 3".   It's not the size of the man in the fight....
what a great man
Bloody Brilliant - Thank you Sir!
Chris, what an amazing topic. When I joined the army [1980] the movie was a must watch prior to attending your first promotion course for corporal. And this was 1980 and only a couple of people in the lines [barracks] had a video player. So you had to sign out the tape out from the OIC training and then we as a group [5or 6] would cram into a room in the lines to watch and re watch the movie. There was no History Chap and YouTube. We were in a rage when we saw that he did not get the VC. And no one knew this amazing story. He was a brilliant soldier and they are few and far between. Just in the past week I have purchased some brand new copies of the movie as well as Zulu Dawn. Not for me to watch as I have on my hard drive. Just in case I loose my copy, they will remain in their clear wraps. Colour Sargent Bourne was an inspiration to myself and many young soldiers over the decades, Cheers love your video's
reminds  me of my grandad in ww2 he had a  muttonchops lol
My favourite Colour Sergeant Bourne observation has always been the one you mentioned. When asked by the young soldier, "Why us, Colour Sergeant,  why us?" he replied,  "Because we're 'ere lad, there's nobody else.  Now run along and join your mates".   Incidentally that came just after the minister and his daughter were escaping the looming attack.  He, the minister, had called back to the waiting soldiers, "You're all going to die".  Which, as it happened, wasn't true.  Thank you for an illuminating account of one of the heroes of that battle.  One of the "Soldiers of the Queen".
What an amazing man and a great leader, thank You
Thankyou for that, it was brilliant as always.
“ You know Baldric, when I joined the army we were fighting fuzzy wuzzies with sharp sticks.”
When he reads the  roll call at the end, always bring a tear to the eye.
God Bless Frank Bourne, the Empire's finest!
“No Comedians, please…”
The Hundred Years War would be interestig.
RAF bomb disposal flight 6228 or 238 squdron history and hero also the evacuation of RAF members from Dunkirk, my father had some interesting stories on that one. On a trip to England he introduced me to Bob Doe.
Colour Sergeant Bourne: Face to the front. Mark the orders. Mark a target when it comes. (softly, to Pte. Hitch) Hitch, do your tunic up. Private Hitch: My tunic? Bourne: Do it up! Where do you think you are, man? 😉
What a life. No VC because doing VC stuff is the job is kinda funny.
What a soldier
Frank Bourne's radio interview in 1936 was taped over to save on recording costs.  Aaaaaaarrrgh
Forgotten heroes of Rorke’s drift the Zulus
Regarding the associated battle at Isandlwana, Natal. There is a memorial inscription on the  gravestone of the parents of a Glasgow Army officer, who was killed at that battle. I think his name  was Macpherson, unfortunately when I went to see the stone again at a later date, the whole area was overgrown  with a mat of grass and weeds and I couldn't find it. There must have  been many personal stories behind the casualties of this campaign.
That was a great story well researched and well told. Regards.
"Button your collar"..............
“Do your tunic up, where do you think you are man?!?” So British.  But Assistant Commzensary Officer Dalton was the real hero and the film did not do him Justice
I'd like to see you cover the tragic story of Colonel Stoddard and Captain Connolly who were kept captive in a bug pit in Bokhara, it's a fascinating story, one of many from that era.
I have watched ZULU many time and have a good deal of books and periodicals on Rourkes Drift and the Anglo-Zulu war. Your presentation is excellent. Keep your videos coming.
Amazing final chapters to the often wondered about life of amazing soldier. Lots of answers to a lot of questions. thank you.
Because we're here and no body else.
Brilliant thank you for this video
Hitch, you're alive, I've seen you !,
Color Sgt Bourne epitomizes the professional NCO that is the back bone of every army. His reading and writing for his men, is real part leadership. It generates trust. True leadership isn't based on screaming it is based on trust.
Aaalllright then nobody told you to stop working !!
Fire at the smoke
The  man is a legend and hero and great to know that he wasn't killed in action and had a long life
When you said he trained the British and Irish soldiers in Dublin at that time the the Irish troops were British as were the sots and English. ,  even now I am called a Irish vetran of an Irish regiment of the British Army when in fact I am British
“Hitch?, Hitch I saw you, your alive” 😆
I saw this movie in the theater in the United States Army base at Munich. It has been a favorite of mine ever since then. I know that historically is not entirely what you would call accurate. I think it does portray the discipline of the British army during its colonial empire building times very accurately. As far as why didn't they just leave? They wouldn't be able out run the Zulus. The cast in the movie I thought it was excellent. I just may have to go back and watch it for the 9 millionth time! It is a part of my collection
Get sweating.
Brilliant!! Some of that looked like it was shot in the grounds of Pershore Abbey. With St Andrews church in the background.I'm from just down the road in Evesham.  Maybe Another Battle to cover, 1265 The Battle of Evesham?
What an amazing life experience. From the Zulu War to the end of WWII. You already recited my favourite line; the simple stoic answer,”Because we are here.”
"get sweatin"
This is nice to know, he seemed to be a very likeable NCO?
Great stufff 👍
Excellent.. really enjoyed that .. please keep it coming .. there’s a good lad .. hehe 👍😁
Mr Witt, be quiet now will you, there's a good gentleman. You're disturbin' the lads....
Was he an ancestor of Jason Bourne?
Great video.thank you
Thank you, I've always wondered why he did not receive the VC.
Tuck your 'Eds in , afore they fall off!
Very well done, Sir.  What a great and steadfast example of manhood in a soldier he was.  Who wouldn't want 100 of these men around you, anywhere, in any battle?  That takes incredible nerve and discipline.  If I may suggest topics, could you please do a video on the Imphal battle in India in WWII and how the British succeeded against the guerilla war in Malaya (Malaysia) post-WWII. Thank you.
Thanks! Amazing that he lived to see the end of WW2
Nigel Greens Clr Sgt Bourne at the first appearance if the Zulu Impi     "All right. Nobody told you to stop working'"  Classic!
Fantastic.....as ever
5' 3" Sgt Bourne reminds me a bit of Audie Muphy, as he too was short at 5' 5", but both were large in performing deeds of valor. It's not the size of the dog in the fight, but the size of the fight in the dog that matters.
Another great story and video, thanks 👍
I love this channel. I'm interested in how a private company came to rule India. When you've got a spare minute!!!!!
Thanks for another great presentation as always much appreciated, it must take lots of your precious time to achieve so much knowledge 🇬🇧
35 years service absolutely amazing man ,deserves all respect and his legendary status 🇬🇧
Superb. I thoroughly enjoyed that, thanks.
"Say sir......officer on parade"
What a damned brilliant example of a man, citizen and soldier! He was then, when I first saw the film, and now an inspiration to me. I see now why the wokesters of the past and today want memories of him and others like him to be suppressed - he and they might positively influence youngsters away from mobile phones and BS.
A prayer 's as good as a bayonet on a day like this !  . . . . also Psalm 46 he breaketh the bow and snappeth the spear in sunder I'll be exalted by the heathens and exalted in the earth the Lord of hosts is with us. A great scene with Jack Hawkins who played the preacher Mr Witt. Those are probably my favorite C/SGT Bourne quotes .  Many Thanks Chris
We're dead good arnt we 🇬🇧
To turn a phrase from Hiratio Hornblower... (while not technically correct) he was a man who came from the age of "Wooden ships and Iron men".
Thanks for that one Chris. I remember that the BBC loved to show Zulu every Christmas time and my dad wouldn't have missed it for the world. My favourite line from the film was when Colour Sergeant Bourne announces the arrival of the Zulus on the crest of the hill," Zulus sir, thousands of 'em." He barely bats an eyelid. There's something about the Tommy Atkins understatement which just defines the, "ere we go again " attitude of the British soldier.
Another fantastic video!  "When you're in command old boy, you're on your own."
A good idea for a program maybe?? About an admiral called vice admiral sir George Tryon who collided with another ship off the coast of Malta in 1893 until then he had had a excellent career !!
Excellent thank you well researched and presented!! Sadly the actor who played him committed suicide I read a few weeks ago !!
Only the BBC could bin such an interview... nothing much changes!
"Psalm 46 Sir, He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth.  He breaks the bow and shatters the spear;     he burns the shields with fire. He says, “Be still, and know that I am God;     I will be exalted among the heathen,     I will be exalted in the earth." The Lord Almighty is with us" Amen, and another great story, thanks!
Frank Bourne was Born a leader. Great description of this battle. So enjoyable.
Well I can count myself to the people that believed he got that award. What an outstanding man he was.
The film always holds a place in my heart (despite the 'Men Of Harlech' scene) as we first saw it in our 'film club' after school in the early '70s
I’m sure people on this channel probably know but there is a narrated version of that transcript on YouTube somewhere 👌🏼
Nobody told you to stop work
Excellent, really enjoy these types of stories, thanks
I would like to hear about another hero who survived lots of campaigns.
It's a shame he's buried in a unkept grave in Elmer's end cemetery south London crystal palace,is this how we treat our heroes,it's a disgrace,you get better treatment rowing over in dingy,we should be ashamed of ourselves, woke cowards,well not me🇬🇧
Thank You for telling his full story.  Zulu is a classic movie I’ve watched it many times.
Fav quote "All right then, no-one told you to stop working" Video suggestions maybe a wee bit early in the time scale. But how about the Marquis of Montrose, James Graham and his year of victories during the war of the 3 Kingdoms. Great content as per what we have become used to.
"Right you lot! Get sweatin'"
As an American, the first time I’d even heard of the battle was as an extremely bored junior NCO wandering through the nearest blockbuster video ( that’s history in its self ) looking for something new ( to me at least )   How can I use my favorite lines , when you’ve pinched them for your example?   I’ll have you use someone else as a substitute.  ‘ He’s a Peeler , come to arrest the Zulu! ‘  In the Sharpes novels there is a character from Virginia, are there any notable American loyalists in the British army at that time ?
My first CSM, a Coldstream guardsman from Yorkshire reminded me of C/sgt Bourne from the first day I met him as a young recruit in 1976. A no- nonsense, brick shithouse of a man he exemplified professionalism, patience and honesty. I would have numerous CSM's in the following 25 years but he was the only one whom I never heard swear or show anger. I can still hear him say, "You're like a ruddy teddy bear lad", when I fecked up on the parade square. Good man.
fascinating
Think he needs a movie?  Wow!
As an historical representation I have become less enchanted by the film since more of the historical inaccuracies came to light, such as the claimed Welsh nature of 24th at that time, and the alleged presence of the Company choir (led by Ivor Emmanuel whose film career the rôle was supposed to boost).  Only later did the 24th become the South Wales Borderers; but Stanley Baker apparently insisted that they be Welsh.  Further, the salute by the Zulus after the fighting on film, did not happen, although I can certainly see why a device was found to commend the Zulu bravery.  However, Nigel Green's performance was outstanding.  I like his " Because we're 'ere, lad, because we're 'ere, lad.... Just us..... nobody else", which gives his realistic prediction of the likely outcome.  Similarly, his human but disciplined approach to the roll call parade, is beautifully done.  Best of all, though, for my money, is his conversation with the drunken Jack Hawkins: it is a style of deferential yet forceful insistence which I have seen deployed by Mess Sar'n Majors when young officers had been overindulging on the bottle and were likely to start damaging the Mess. Utterly brilliant!
Now that’s one special soldier,RIP Sir❤️
HITCH...HITCH...I saw you ,you're alive...say sir, officer on parade...now get off to hospital where you belong. Im a huge fan if Nigel Green.  I have an Enfield no 1 mk 3 no star that i named Nigel in honor of  Mr. Green.
Hitch... Hitch, I saw you. You're alive. Fantastic presentation Chris as always.
One of the reasons Zulu is so timeless is it just presents what happens in a very matter of fact way. It doesn't portray either side as the heroes or villains, just 2 armies doing their job. If it was made today you just know they'd have to include lectures about the evils of colonialism. and an overtly racist character
Enjoy your work!…have you done one on the battle of Tamai  (1884) or the battle of Tofrek (1885)…British infantry square fighting off the furious fuzzy-wuzzy…
after WW1 SHOULD OF BEEN KNIGHTED
Thank you - another very interesting video!  My favourite Colour Sgt Bourne quote is the one you mentioned - "Because we're 'ere lad - and no one else.  Just us."  He also says the quote that has been wrongly attributed to Michael Caine by one or two impressionists in the past: "...Zulus... - thousands of them!"  Except he says "The sentries report Zulus to the south west - thousands of them."  And I've just remembered another Colour Sgt Bourne quote:  Near the beginning of the film, Bromhead is out hunting, and a rifle shot in the distance is heard at the Drift.  Hughes (he of the bushy mutton chops and moustache) hangs out the hospital window and asks "Colour Sergeant Bourne, what's that shooting?" "A rifle, Hughes" comes Bourne's reply!  Great stuff.  The rock formation that is the dramatic backdrop to the film is called "The Amphitheatre" and if you were to climb that escarpment, you'd more or less be in Lesotho at the top.  It makes for a great background, but is actually about 100 miles to the south west of the real Rorke's Drift.  It's a fantastic location though!
Excellent bit of history. Thank you.
When we think of the Victorian British Army it is usual to think of the class prejudice and snobbery that goes with it, and yet, here we have an example of a man who came from the most humble level of British society to a position of considerable respect. I have no doubt crossing into the officers' mess hall was as difficult as any challenge he encountered across his career.
Hook was a surprise in real life
"Zulus sir, fousands of em"  Unknown squaddie, Roarkes Drift 1879.  "Afghans sir, fousands of em" - unknown squaddie 2003  They never learn do they...   That would be the Martini Henry Patent Self Exploder? Almost as useless as the SA80A1.
Zulu , thousands of them!
If you're amenable, I'd be interested in hearing about the storming of the Taku Forts or other episodes from the Opium Wars. As always, love your videos, keep up the good work!
Excellent presentation as always Chris. One of my favorite films. I've quoted the line to friends from time to time: "Ching-ching. Carry on with your mud pies".
'Alright lads, no one told you to stop working'.
“No comedians, please…”
“Do that top button up lad “ Nigel Green superb actor .
William Robert Robertson,  From Private to Field-Marshal
Col. H Jones in the Falklands or is that to modern.
“Get back on the wall lad, with your mates”
"Mr Witt Sir. Be quiet now will you, there's a good Gentleman; You'll upset the Lads"
That was very good thank you !!
What distinguished career..the great thing was his skills weren't wasted.
I think we can all agree that the true hero of the film was that Welsh top tenor, an invaluable strategic asset the Zulus crucially lacked. :)
And the bayonet sir, with some guts behind it
