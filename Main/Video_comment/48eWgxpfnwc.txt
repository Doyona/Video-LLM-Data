I love Daniel’s laugh😭
El mejor trío de Red Bull ❤❤❤❤ que lastima que ya no estén los tres juntos 😔
I don’t know what’s happening with laps and stuff but all I know is that I’m hearing 3 grown men constantly laughing
the three best goffs
Also was this speed boat an Adrian Newey side project - mini RC high speed speedboat
Imagine the diver reading the job description and being like “flip overturned mini speed boat, do not get hit by mini speedboat driven by f1 drivers”
I was not prepared to watch these boats flop about like fish, I’m fucking dying
@Oracle Red Bull Racing..oh do you mean RC Boat Remote Control from Monaco?👌
It´s a shame Ricciardo 😑. “Bad decisions” is the name of this movie
They should at least put flags so it's more fun for the race.
Imagine a world where Kimmi are still racing. And he are with Redbull.. and he needs to do this sort of things
i am so happy that daniel and max are together again!!!
I can't really put into words how much i hate Ricciardo.
الضحكه ترد الروح يا دانيال ❤😍
I ha cheered for Max in 2021 now looking at how he and team RedBull treat him I am no longer a RedBull supporter. You people deserve to lose for decades like Williams did.
Empresa hipócrita a uno lo tienen de chivo expiatorio y a otro le dan el 100% se burlan de la afición
Sabotaging Checo should be ashamed, what a coincidence that nothing happens to the weeping boy's car and neither does his strategy ???!!!!! Sucks 👎🏼
Red Bull 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼 a company for a single driver they are crap
Mr smiles and the team selling smoke
what the diver doing in the water for hahahaha
0:03 If dis' how Daniel define "super sunny", then how is cloudy ?
Max and Daniel are vibing so good together
Son Gratis los Mundiales F1 de Max y morirán sabiendo el Mundo 🌎
I swear, Max doesn't act like this with anyone and I mean ANYONE. Like slumping on the floor, laughing with his body bent, whipping around and beaming, and so on. And the way Daniel just lets Max fiddle with his controller like a kid and doesn’t give a shit. Danny really does give out the best on Max. And in return, Max instantly being a kid with him.
Ujang rohmat.
1:10 "What i do with my Booooat??"
I liked more when Ricciardo Wasn’t there jajaja
WHERE CAN I BUY THEM?!
I really like this boat race with Sergio perez and Daniel Ricciardo and Max verstappen from Monaco Grand prix weekend.
This title probably hasn't aged well considering recent events. Might want to edit the title of this video.
Checo being Mexican at the end sayin “can we keep this” 😂😂😂😂
Daniel is In shock Beucase the boat is faster that the McLaren
This side of Max is  too precious
I like how Perez is the only one thinking about playing with that thing back in the pool In his room when he is asking if he can keep it at the end.. I know he is because of the waves I’m just sitting there thinking how much better it would be with no waves and I know he is to.. hahaha
What boats are that ?
Sunny daniel 😘
The besties back together 😄 Man, hearing Ricci's laughter made me realize how much I missed that over the last few years ❤
That diver is a brave man…
Hi welcome to Jackass…
Its like being on a date and checo is the third wheel oh dear ,  where will he be next year at home
I want one of these boats . Say checo Pérez and I 😂
Porque tanta velocidad??
So Daniel is taller than Max 😂 I swear F1 drivers keep their height like it’s national secret🥹 Charles definitely not 180cm then
Won't be long before checo is out and Danny boi is back 🙌
they should have pitted for extreme wets
What's funny is I was playing with my dads RC boats this weekend lol
I wonder if Danny could get a seat at Aston Martin? I think if stroll could  secure a  seat at   Alfa or Alpha the old man would let him go for possibly a real chance at a constructors championship with Ric and Alonso. If anyone remembers Ric  blitzed Ocon in the same car 2020. and now Ocon sits just shy of Stroll in a car which is definitely outgunned by Aston Martin. I say this because there is no way RB are getting rid of Checo
this was not very fun to watch, can't even follow what is happening
RBR has done games and fun liike this during race weekends for a while now...and although other teams do similar activities I feel this is of actual importance when it comes to redbull. I get it is great for the brand, but do you also think this helps get the drivers relaxed before a race weekend?
it is fast because Adrian Newey designed it!!!!!
1:13 Danny Ric stunt double?
Yo apoyo a #checoperez ❤
Imo best duos Lando n sainz Gasly n tsunoda  Max n ricciardo
Must be nice having your own diver to flip your RC boat right side up!
Ricciardo always brings the laughs 😂 Gotta love him!
This is why RB rehired Daniel.
I love how Daniel Ricciardo is still by far the most popular driver in the F1 paddock even though he doesn't have a driver's seat at the moment. It says a lot.
what💀
Why is there a rescue diver in an RC boat race?  It was the diver that was most in danger here.
small,medium,large
But why was the diver there 🤣
Soooo, Max and Checo is 1, 11 and Max and Daniel used to be 33 and 3?
so there is a dude that his job is to put the mini boat on track if it turns over!! where can I apply ?
I really feel that Max is the most himself when he’s hanging with Danny
Thanks diver for putting those boats upright again, hope you got a nice payday.
Danny ric has some how finessed his sense of humor into big checks. What a G
TOTAL cringe
Finally, some competitive racing at a location that should have been abandoned many decades ago.
Da Max is back❣️ I love it 🤩
Daniel just brings people together 😂
Someone edited this mess of a video and thought "ah yes, this is content".
checo and his sons max and daneil
Max herzliche Glückwünsche zu deinem Monaco Sieg👏👏👏
Wish Lewis was in this ,boy he would have loved to race against all 3 RB drivers 😊
What make and model were those radio controlled boats, i want one lol😂
These 3 are actual children and I am here for it!
Daniel is a guy who enjoys life, whatever it brings him. How not to like him?
Nice to see a cameo from Danil Kvyat, torpedo in the water!
These things are stupid fast, and the fact that they have a dedicated boat flipper diver is peak rich people energy.
the fact they have a whole ass diver for these 3 kids to drive around a boat 😂
What boats are those?
Get these boats in the store!!!!! I’m buying!!!
They have a man who's diving only just to flip up their boats. It's like you're playing football and the young Gs just passing the ball every time you miss ;D
They look like 3 small kids with those jackets :D
What are this boats called I need one 😂
Who doesn't love to see Max fall on the ground from laughing when he is with my all time favorite driver Daniel...This just made me smile so much...
not sure but it looked like Checo was waiting very long yesterday to take his grid position.....thankfully Max´ car didn´t catch fire.
Best F1 duo everrrr!!! Danny and Max
Why is a nondrivers name in front of current p2?
Seeing max and Daniel together again healed my depression
Big kids lol.  Your mums must be something special to have put up with you guys lol😂
What is the make/model of these boats? I want one!
Lots of elle oh elles... 😂 (if you know, you know)
Love seeing Daniel!
F1 imola 2023 gp be like
Daniel Riccardo and Pals
that diver had to have his head on a swivel.
Not that it was even, I see that Max is faster than Checó Pérez because the cars of Checó Pérez and Max are so different 😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
There's no need for the diver. They just put him there to taunt the poor guy.
I think if Max wins his third title with Redbull he should get his own Redbull Flavour  Redbull Max Verstappen Edition
Why do they need a freaking tech diver for recovery?
That's the redbull rocketship!
They are children🤣
Anyone here in the comments just to find out what the boats are and where we can buy one? Just me?
What is Daniel doing with his life wish he would stop messing about and get back to racing he got talent and he just not using it. Forget F1 and try another motor sport
The poor diver must have PTSD after that
The camera men tho
Daniels laugh is so wholesome 🤗
Imagine chilling on your boat , and you look over to see the redbull team with a diver in the water, mini speed boats and Daniel on the verge of tears from laughing
“mate how is this thing so fast??”  *its redbull daniel. it’s redbull*
where can I buy one of those boats?... WHERE?
Daniel has that smile and laughter that getting $23M from your former employer's to play RC boats can only bring.
i love how Checo always wants to keep the things/toys they use probably for his kids <3
I wish I have a diver who can retrieve my RC boat…
Yo where can I get one of these??!!! These are awesome!
Thats 3 Monaco race winners there...
Should have given them Traxxas boats!
Red bull Damage the car of Checo Perez for NO win to Vestappen
It so funny that these words come out from the best F1 drivers 0:50
Last time singing duck. this time checo's kid getting a boat
The only time I like Max is when he's with Daniel 😂.  Those two have such great chemistry.
They should keep them for a little something for children
Checo ya va practicando para su equipo  de lanchitas eléctricas
Faster than a McLaren
can we have them ¡¡ can we keep them??... i would ask the same.. haha.. this is funny on weed... Ricciardo always is like if he had some weed..
@1:56 The Redbull samon failed back to up stream.
Max and Danny together again just feels right. Like the world can be at peace
Daniel’s laugh always makes me smile. He’d be so much fun to hang out with!
Like a bunch of children :) love seeing them all together.
This reminds me of my wife's favorite saying "Men never grow up!  There toys just gets more expensive"  When men start playing all seriousness go out the window. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  PS. Stop making up stories of Checo is a 3rd wheel and creating non excitant controversy, his having just as much fun as the other two 👍👍👍
MAX YEAR THE BEST YEAR SHOWS MAX YEAR RACE GOOD TES.❤.
Perez becoming a bit of a third wheel in these vids lol the chemistry between max and daniel is just too good you cant interfere
the amount of fun theyre having kills me lol
For the most lucrative race in the F1 calandra - these shenanigans are subpar.
you know it’s good when max has no voice left after being 30 seconds into the video 😂
Where can we buy these?
Should have done this for imola
checo, max and a new redbull content creator/sunday driver
Loved the moment when Daniel elbowed Max when the boat nearly flipped out of the water and they laughed together.
Those boats are faster than the McLaren's 😂
There was no way that would have worked without dainel .
They don't sink
"Bwoah i like this" 😂
Haha real funny but...Onboard camera🤔🤣🤣🤣
Max: "where's mine?" Ricc: "i'll come and get you" is just the best thing
It is just so good to see them laugh so hard
Just give poor Checo a break from these social media engagements, he's basically third-wheeling the Maxiel show at every point.
The reference to Tina Turner's 'Proud Mary' in the soundtrack is nice 👍
Please dont attack cameraman😂😂😂
Just three grown men being kids for a little while. That looks like so much fun.
I’m pretty sure Red bull hired back Ricciardo just because Max has too much fun with him
👍
Ok, where can I get one of those boats? That looks like fun. 😂
You call tell the paddock has been serious this year so far barely any jokes or any banter... cause no danny ric
Brilliant fun guys, Daniel should get them all together again and do some other RC fun 🫡
I have really missed Daniel's laugh!
what brand are those rc boats, i want one.
The pan to Max on the floor 😂
If checo didnt get to keep the boats im starting riots
Can we have this? Can we keep them? 33 years old Perez. - We men never age.
“Sink”? Or rather, “SINK”? Nope. Nothing sank.
I feel bad for the camera man diver
1:28 😂😂
Checo always ends up saying can we have this? 😂😂😂
love Daniel laughs 😂
Meanwhile, over at Ferrari…
1:58 😂😂😂😂
I missed this.. this is actually better than watching you compete..
love daniel's energy
Max & Daniel obviously have a good friendship, they are like good buds hanging out. Checo having a good time as well, just not quite as silly as the other two. Enjoyed this one, more please
Checo feels like the 3rd person in the relationship.
And they said we wouldn’t get an imola gp
Haha boys and their toys 😂
Can we keep them?   How sweet, little boy checo
Nice
Enchante.
Poor guy. Literally being used as a circus conductor
longer version
Is it just me or checo looks a bit uncomfortable here ? … maybe it’s the idea of Danny ric replacing him next year or somethin 😂
HOW IS THAT EVEN CONTROLLABLE??
Logged Dive: Monaco Harbour Max depth: 5m Tried not to get hit by F1 drivers driving boats 😂
I love how guys around the world are so simple and little like give them a RC boat to play with and they'll be as happy as ever
Where can we buy the RC Boats?
Ayyy!! Checoooo 😅 we love u 💕
1 GOAT, 1 driver, and 1 PR officer
La risa de Daniel es lo mejor
I hope Checo kept his boat
"Can we keep them?" Perez asking the real questions 😂
checo loves free stuff
3rd car for Dan Ric next year??
Im just wondering what the scuba dividing job description was... LOL
Checo always wanting to keep everything 😂😂 love him
Why am I hearing that Danny is the only one who can complete his full cycle laugh? 😂

So sad how Danny Ric has fallen.
❤️❤️❤️
What good content! It's nice to see the three of them together. But more than anything it makes me happy to see Sergio! In this world where extroverts predominate, it gives me joy to see and identify with someone like CHECO 💙 Always calm and smiling. I'm a fan of that boy 🙌
Maxi and dani 👌🤣
Give checo that boatt asap
cheko always asks for freebees
Max and Daniel should just go do the DTM one season together.
More of Maxiel-Content please ...
How ironic that Daniel takes his rightful place as the Red Bull clown 😂
The hand coming out of the water😂
Max gets along much better with Ricciardo
Checo: Can I keep it? lol boys will be boys.
How is it so fast? Adrian Newey probably designed it hahahaha
Boys and toys, always fun.
What a Bullshit ! Stupid games !
Red bull gonna sell theese boats?
poor checo man he’s always the third wheel with these two
It seems Daniel has become a presenter 😢
Ok but seriously, tell me more about those RC boats, they looked insane!
The best part is the driver trying to be sneaky
😂👏👍so funny to watch 😆
That Ricky Ric 😂 fits perfect there mate. 🫶🏼💪🏼
Just 3 kids who are monaco gp winners playing with toys
Sergio just trying to keep as many souvenirs as he can ❤❤❤
The best combo to happen on F1 IMO is Max and Daniel
Love Danny Ric’s personality back at redbull. Missed him doing stuff like this for years!
I like how Checo is acting like a dad and Daniel and Max are acting like his kids
I like this side of Max when he is with Daniel.
We miss your laughs, Dannyric.
you would think they could do this at the miami gp, but they don’t believe in real water
Put Riccardo back in the car or get him to do the grid walk interviews, either way it will be fun👍💪
Checo at the end- can we keep it?!  Reminds me of him asking if he can keep the baby shark toy last year in Monaco😂
I know RB has a rocket ship racing car, but don’t even know that they got these rocket ship speedboat! 🙈 RB is amazing!
Wow those things are faster than this year’s Mercedes.
They faster than an Alpha Tauri
So hectic, pure C H A O S, I love it!!
the most chaotic trio around! <3
love to see maxiel together
“We’re going to take part in an RC boat race.” I’m still waiting for the race.
I second with Checo, I want one😂
Three times in the season in which Perez's car is not good? Sabotaging again, we have to make shitstappen win however, however possible, the joke is that the sweet babe wins?
I only clicked to hear Danny Ric’s laugh
what rc boat is that? shit is hauling ass
マックスは常に最高であり続ける。 チームは世界最多ワールドチャンピオン獲得に向けて一丸となって目標に突き進むべき。
Max and Daniel the best and funniest racing duo in a extremely long time!
I miss Daniel and max sorry <3
Max: "how is this so quick" also everyone to the RB19: "how is this so quick"
The fact that they had a diver in the harbor for them is amazing
Fun kkkkk
Love me some Danny
Daniel is working as a team ambassador... It's been great!
chaos, utter chaos, i'm so here for this
can i buy my own one?
Never change DR 😂
Did that boat get stuck in a tecpro barrier? 😂 This was great fun. As ever Red Bull is living up to its "racing, while serious, is meant to be fun" reputation! I'm all for that 😆
😂😂
Christian: Daniel, Just because you became our socials manager does not mean you can get our drivers injured, Checo and Max are now in the hospital for getting stung by 50 bees just because you wanted honey... Daniel: But i like honey.. Christian: YOU HATE HONEY!  *EL PLAN FAILED*
Where can I buy one of these boats haha
Max is fast in everything 😅😅😅
Where can I buy one of these 😂
The "I'll come get you" 😂
Maxiellllllll
Danny’s laughter is so contagious
Checo always wants to keep the toys
Whahaha these guys are making millions, Checo still asking if he can keep it 🤣
So sunny right now
Most intense race I’ve ever seen 10/10
it is now time for jet boat racing 😎
Vamos checo ganhar campeonato mundial  numero 1 do el Mundo
2:20 Checo asking to keep the boats!😂
Awww, Checo is keeping the boat for his kid
3rd wheeling Riccardo is funny as can be.
Lol Checo's inner kid came out can we have them? Can we keep them? 😂
Anyone else feel like Daniel got some of Lando’s laugh stuck with him? 😂
Where can I get one of those boats? Those are crazy fast 😂
Maybe Red Bull must race with three cars. Daniel belongs to Red Bull.🤣🤣🤣🤣
These guys getting genuine kicks out of RC was great.
Hearing Daniel laugh will never fail to make me happy. I also love seeing him and Max together, they are so chaotic together. With Sergio, they form an amazing trio. Keep it coming admin <3
This video was waaaaayyyy too short. We need an extended version
okay but why are there divers in the water?
Danny's laughter is on another level, we love him 🫶🏼🥰
Love it.
Checoooo 💖💖💖💖💖💖
DR career 📉 bad
Checo asking the real questions: can we have them? Can we keep them?
WE NEED DANIEL AS OUR WEEKEND GUIDE!!!  give him a camera crew and just make your own show please!@!!
How did this ever get approved by EHS? Diver's face right at the level of those boats...
Man what a great set of guys and drivers! We need more of the three of them
„Can we keep them?“ 😭
The Fans won! Yes we did, Daniel, yes we did.
Three Monaco GP Winners 🏆
Boys will be boysssss
Max & Daniel bonding   Checo~ 😃
Whats the model of the speedboats?
Yuki must feel sick from riding in that boat!  😉
I live for that laugh 😂 DR ❤️
YESSSSS THANK YOU ADMIN!!!!😊
So wait who is controlling Yuki and who is controlling Pedro
"Can we keep them" 🤣
Love Maxiel
Max + Daniel = CHAOS AND LAUGHTER 😂
Checo is the third wheel lol.
Checo giving awkward 3 rd wheeling energy 😂
The only thing keeping Redbull's F1 Marketing together was Danny Ric and here he IS!
can we keep them ... nice toy
I could watch Max and Daniel being silly together all day. These two have so much fun together, I love them ❤
That donut in the end was epic😅😅😅
“how is this thing so fast” says every other driver on the grid about red bull😂
Dani Rick's laugh is music to the ears.
😂
Max and Danny get along so well a lot of times and looks like Checo is feeling left out ;D
You can tell checo is really enjoying this when he asked to keep one
😎 Soow those are very speedy fast RC boats. Max requested a review so we give it. Max we like them and the race as well. Unfortunatelly you should do a revange against Checo 😂 So good luck gentlemen against Daniel aka the joker 😂. Good luck this weekend with the Monaco F1 race. Remember the walls don't be showing any sympathie.
You know they were aiming for the diver lol
Loved it Could I have one Just email me/ message back plz
Max and Daniel are gold
Where's the sinking?
2016 madness all over again putting Max and Daniel together.
Boys will be boys! Right up their alley..
Max actually trying and you know it’s cause Daniel is there!
absolute chaos
Replace Perez with Ricciardo
Max and Daniel are SO chaotic together😅
Checo just wants to keep his new toy!
Can we keep them ? lol
Checo is the 3rd wheel lol
2:02 am I just hallucinating or is that right guy Niko Omilana
weird absence of Imola jokes...
This was mind blowing and hilarious to watch. Absolutely incredible 👍😍 That car just flew, probably rocketboat 😂
I see Daniel , I click
u should give  him a clown costume  fits  with his  skills aswell
They're just kids racing super fast cars, loved the video!
Max ALWAYS folds his torso when Daniel makes him laugh 😂
Can we keep them 🤣
These RC boats are gonna put them over the cost cap.
Maxiel❤❤❤❤
Awesome video, guys have more money than they know what to do with... Give them some kids toys and let the chaos commence.
Sergio “can we have them?” 😂❤❤
🤲🌏💪🏻success Daniel
All these videos are just Daniel laughing and smiling and you know what? I'm here for it!!
Made me smile. 🙂
Boys and toys
Jesus Christ, drivers as soon as you hand them an RC, chaos and carnage 🤩 Is the diver still with us?
1:56 😭😭🤣🤣😭🤣😭
Dani's home race 🤭❤️🤍🦬🦬🦬❤️🤍
admin, more maxiel content please
Checo saying like a good latino "Can we keep them?" lol
It's fun to see the side of Max's personslity that's still competitive, but not serious and relatable.  Reminding me he's a human and not a machine... even if he drives like a machine.  😎
Checo gets a little snowed under now by those 2 other clowns 😂🤡
Nothing I love more than some good Max and Daniel moments
I love this so much😂 Such awesome energy 💙💙💙💙
The whole video is just max and daniel having the best time ever and checo is just there
This was just CHAOS but I loved it. Daniel’s laugh is contagious.
Claim your “here within an hour” token here!
ric went from "I dont wanna be secondary choice to max" to "I'll just be a show host for my retirement paycheck" lol
Hahaha ha i need one!! 😂😂😂
Daniel 🤩🤩🤩
Boys will be boys!
When did one sink?
Just give Daniel the Social Media Manager position already.
モナコｷﾀｧｧｧ MONAKO Is Coming!!!!
Maxiel 💜
Boast? Whoops
5 second penalty for Ocon

Fastest RC Boast SINKS in Monaco | feat. Max Verstappen, Daniel Ricciardo and Checo Perez
Might want to edit the title (RC Boast), great video tho!

FIRST Edit: I just realized im not the first one to comment 😔😔
