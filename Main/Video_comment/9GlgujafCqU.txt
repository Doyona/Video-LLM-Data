TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!
I love you techno
3 years now
Ohh...No😭😭🥺🥺😟😔😔😔
RIP Tecnoblade It Was too late , the cancer had spread to his lungs
June 30th, 2022, was the day that the Minecraft community went into mourning over Techno. I propose that June 1st (His birthday), or June 30th (his death date), should be a day that we celebrate Techno and what he did for the Minecraft community
Very Sad 😢
23 was to young he was a child to his dad
Bro why does cancer always kill the best Minecraft YouTubers
5 Years Of Watching His Content 😢
Guys one more time about techno i always loved to call him tech
He says "Technoblade never dies" ..       his name and legacy will never die

Before she dies, I want her to be happy, and I don't want to cause trouble for my mom. Fuxk cancer!🤬🤬🤬🤬 Fuxk COVID-19!!🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬

NOBODY REALLY DIES OF CANCER. THEY DIE BECAUSE OF THE KEMO THERAPY WHICH WEAKENS THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEM. IF PEOPLE WOULD STOP GETTING KEMO THEY WOULDNT BE DYING. YOU CAN LIVE WITH CANCER NO PROBLEM ITS THE KEMO THAT KILLS PEOPLE NOT THE CANCER ITSELF

Believe on the Lord Jesus and though shalt be saved. No good works added can save you just the free gift of God. Life can be shorter than we think get right with God asap.He loves us but we need to know we have sinned against Him.
Probably one of those guys that sat on his rear end playing video games all day. If he'd went outside and gotten a little sun and exercise he would probably still be alive.

we hope you have a very good time we suport you technoblade i wish this never happend😔😭😭😭😭😭😭
i bulid a technoblade statue for him i hope i remember him
I understand the dark humor as that was the way he was, and it’s keeping his spirit alive, but whether he used dark humor doesn’t make it right to be disrespectful, there’s a difference between light non insensitive dark humor and disrespect. I didn’t watch him but he seemed like a nice guy it’s a shame he was taken so early, I was born the same year as him and it really puts life into perspective. R.I.P Technoblade 🙏 Super funny kind hearted guy who helped a lot of people with his content, awesome voice as well!
Techno never dies😭😭😭
SO??? I DON'T CARE 😂😂
My son (11) told about this tonight, and I could hear the hurt in his voice. Now I’m crying & I don’t know him.

This is sad.  Why the young ones?  Oldies keep on hanging and ruining the world.  I can't even say he is in better place.  No,  his better place would be with his family right here.  Be at peace,  but this downright painful.  Last week or two,  two or more does by cancer of some sorts, YouTube and tiktokers. It's so sad.  Real sad.

TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES
Me: It's okay, guys. I know you guys miss him so much, believe me. All the YouTubers do too. But I believe we'll do the right thing for him as we try to make or build things, we'll build different plans like science, machines, a home, magic, or living in the jungle survivor. Maybe build a new town, a kingdom, or a huge city like New York City, London, California or maybe go Antarctica. And if you can be creative, survival or anything you dreams will come to you. I know some kids needs to learn everything about building things, make stuff like creating statue, sculpture, or anything stuff like that could be hard one, But you guys missed him? Yes, all of us do. That's a choice we made, in our heart. But if we try to do the right thing, we will do everything we can to do it for him. It's not too late guys, there is one hope inside. And I offered pray for you, my lord, Jesus Christ. I hope you give him a life in the heaven and keep everyone safe from the soul, and our hearts. I hope my grandpa will forgive his life and his memories. May God's blessings and thank you so much. Amen. 😔🙏🕊️⚰️🌹🌺🌺💐💐💐💐🌺🌼🌼💖💖💖💖💖🌺🌺🌺🌺🌹🌹🌹🌹🕊️🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😔😔😔💔💔💔💔💝💝💝💝💝💓💓💓💓💞💞💞💞💞💕💕💕💕❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💙💙💙💙💙💜💜💜💜🧡🧡🧡🧡💛💛💛💛💚💚💚💚😿😿😿😿🌼  Goodbye, Technoblade.

"TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES" Rest In Peace
"Techno never dies" rip technoblade :(
Dang I didn’t even know about this until this video was randomly recommended to me. I never really watched his content but man this makes me sad
😭😭😭😭😢😢
That sucks 😞
:(
Ive been subbed for only a year 😟
Rest In Peace techno blade 🥺
He was great
Rest In Peace Techno 😔
I've been a fan of Techno for six years. I can't ever express how sad the entire community feels, and how wonderful person he was. For all of you who don't know, Techno donated to  many charities constantly, had a very unique and smart sense of humor, and a very unique way of talking about things. He was a humble, honest guy who was happy he was living "the dream" as he called it. He participated in many tournaments and events of the Minecraft community, and always loved his fandom, receiving fanart and things like that. When he informed us he had cancer, he was so positive about it (as he was with most things) that I didn't even imagine this had a chance of happening. I can only wish the best for his family, and be proud of how much he grew as a person and as a YouTuber in the years I've watched him constantly. He had this joke of doing an "elbow reveal" someday where he'd finally show us what his elbow looked like... And... If you see the picture in  02:03 I can only laugh at the fact that he probably chose to hide his elbow on purpose, just because of the meme, and because he didn't want the elbow reveal to be that way. He used to joke around in 2019 about what it would be like if he passed, and this was when he was a perfectly healthy guy who seemed to have so much time left. And for that, the message the community wants to share with all it's to hug and show that you care to those important to you NOW, and not wait because things can turn downhill very quickly, and even if the person remains positive and jokes about it, don't let that make you think everything will be okay.   Rest In Peace Techno, I'm so glad I've met you and I'm thankful for everything you did and wanted to do. Hugs for the family <3
TechnoBlade truly never dies

The ten Commandments: Will you go to heaven after you die? "For whoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all" (James 2:10). You have to face the Holy God on judgment day. He sees lust as adultery (Matt 5:28) and hatred as murder ( 1 John 3:15). Will you be guilty? Jesus took your punishment on the cross, and rose again, defeating death, to save you from Hell. Repent (Luke 13:5) and trust in him today. " For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life"((John 3:16))
Rip our legend
Rip to techno  all the way  from  Dominica

R.I.P he was a legend :(
Bro they got the news to make an article about technoblade. It's sad that the minecraft legend has died. We will never forget him
A terrifying fact is that cancer will be able to pass on to other youtubers... such as DanTDM, Pewdiepie, markiplier, and etc, but also the Virus going around might be able to do that too
omfg this is SO sad! he died so young. but will forever remain as our technoblade.
I really can't belive it
Technoblade the undying king
😭💔
Technoblade.. Rest in peace i hope you enjoy your next life in a different dimension

What if this is just a fake death. Because we've had a lot of those lately.
Breaks my heart that someone younger than me has left this world 💔
I know he's dead, but I don't feel like he's dead. It's a weird feeling, and because of it I never really felt anything about it. I cried, but that was it.   I don't think I can really get by if I feel his loss, I'm good in my place. Rest in peace, quads man.

On this platform, as in the hearts of the people for whom he provided many hours of memorable entertainment; the memory of Technoblade is enshrined forever.
I never really watched him but the message he left and the hurt and pain you can hear in his fathers voice broke me.. nobody deserves to go through such a hardship to lose ones own kid. My deepest condolences to his family and friends.

"Technoblade never dies."
The famous youtuber technoblade has died of cancer but in his last moments he still thought about his fans he and his family wanted him to do his last video but time goes by so fast he has passed….       Remember what he always says, technoblade never dies, even tho he has already passed but he won’t ever die if we keep him in our hearts. He has helped us through a lot of moments has made us happy and even if he’s hurting he doesn’t want us to be sad, he’s been with us for so many years but we couldn’t say goodbye, I just want to say thank you for staying with us for so long, helping us through good and bad moments, making us happy, thank you for always being with us even when your in pain, all of us just wants to say thank you and goodbye. You’ll always be in our hearts, technoblade never dies.And thank you technos parents for helping your son finish his last request, technos father I want to say I know that your sad but your son will always be with you maybe not by your side but in an other way he’ll always be your son either way, he will be looking down on you, do you think he wants you to be sad, do you want him to see that your sad he will always be here we can’t see him hear him but we know that he’s here he wants us to be happy not sad he doesn’t want to be a burden to anyone so let’s let him rest in peace, he’s been a great idol, a great friend, a great son, an amazing person.Techno’s mother I’ve seen your note in his last video, it’s very obvious that you loved him very much but same thing to him father do you think that he wants you to be sad, no he won’t want that but I understand that your very sad right now losing your son I see that he doesn’t want to bother you both and his siblings very much he just want you all to stay the same and don’t let his death, be in the way for your happy lives, I’m sad to when I saw the video that his father posted, I was devastated my classmate messaged me “technos gone” when I heard that I was like what… and I just rushed and searched what happened to technoblade and I saw what it said it said he died because of cancer and his father posted a video. At the start I didn’t believed it until I saw the video, when I heard that the voice isn’t technos I just started crying but I’m glad that we still got to listen to what he wants to say, thank you so much. He will forever be with us, forever in our hearts. “technoblade never dies-“

he did show his face. just. a long time ago
WAIT, WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?!
Rip
Daaamn R.I.P Technoblade
l wish technoblade never dies was real but there's someday a day you will die R.I.P techno
H Ok please stop. Technoblade was a great person but he was no hero who sacrificed his life to save millions. He was just a guy who played Minecraft and made content for videos. Sure he was a good person and donated money to charities, but that's all there is. You may say he inspired and entertained millions around the world with his content but he didn't upload. Even when he had no cancer, he never uploaded which shows how much he cared for his fans. I'm sorry that he died but he is not a "legend that is very hard to find", and saying that he is disrespectful and offensive to the millions of soldiers who sacrificed their lives in WW2 so you could watch Technoblade.
Long live technoblade
The thing is dream and everyone of his friends and everyone on this world will die and the next generation will have no idea that dream or techno or anyone ever existed and then stumble across one of their vids and not know their dead and actually like their channel and then they wonder why that youtuber never posted anymore and doesnt realize their dead😭
😭
Famous from playing video games.....ill never understand this generation. RIP Techno

Notch, Mojang. I don't know if you'll read this, but would it be possible to leave a Memorial of Technoblade somewhere in Minecraft. Like maybe have his avatar as a new mob in the game somewhere. Or maybe have his crown as a rare wearable enchanted object. Something?

May the Valkyries carry him to the halls of Valhalla, Odin needed his warrior. Gone from us too soon, but may the songs of his life never leave our hearts. Cancer is something that no one should have to go through, but this man faced it head on with a smile on his face. There is nothing stronger than that, a true warrior. Thank you for everything you gave us during your time with us. May Odin guide you in your eternal life. Until Valhalla, Technoblade

Condolences
Man I'm so sorry
😭😭 i was waiting for him to stream rip
:c
I never really was a huge fan of Minecraft but I watched some of his videos a while back and the video when he explained his cancer. I was in a YouTube live stream when it happened and people were commenting that he died, I thought they meant in a Minecraft tournament or something but when I found out he actually died I was heartbroken. He was such a great content creator and made me enjoy the videos I watched of his. Rest In Peace technoblade, you will not be forgotten
I’ve always admired him. Never  greatly watched him, but I watched his videos occasionally. He was an amazing person.
NOOOOOOOOO😭💔
This is very sad I watched him for so long and this happens I’m crying he was my fav yt and everything i hope he likes it in heaven I miss him r.I.p I miss you😭
Rest in peace, technoblade
I just found this out  and have been crying since.
RIP TECHNOBLADE 😭
He’s a legend that’ll never be forgotten
Yay no more cringe techno thank god  YAAAY😄😁😀🥹
♥️♥️♥️♥️😭♥️
I just heard about this. That’s crazy. RIP
i dont love the Dream smp, but still, rest in peace
I wonder if Dream would reveal alot of secrets when he dies
technobald
RIP Technoblade. I never watched his videos but i know what it feels like to have lost a loved one to cancer, my 18 y/o niece died last month to cancer after fighting for over 4 years for her life, she got cancer not long after her mother died of it, truly a sad world we live in.
So young this disease takes too many of our children .
It's amazing that he amassed 1 million subscribers within one day after a death. A true legend.
Rest In peace Technoblade, i will still watch your old videos and you will remain in all of our hearts
Once a legend always a legend
"Technoblade never dies" fly high technoblade we will never forget you! ❤❤❤
Rip techno a true god
He was there to help a big chunk of us throughout quarantine (and way before) and seeing him leave was very hard. He fought really well and just know that he is in a 1v1 fight with god right now, as he promised lol. May he rest
technoblade never dies.
We all love you Techno you have blessed us with many years of entertainment. TECHNO NEVER DIES. 👑👑👑

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO TECHNOBlDE RIP
He was one of my favourite YouTubers
Rest in peace
Man hurts my heart a bit
I didn't know who Technoblade was up until now. Read that he died, and decided to look him up. Looked through comments through multiple things. Sounds like the guy was an amazing person. Technoblade I may have not known you, but fly high, rip.
aww my heart  ever  i didnt know him  but he sure have a good heart and famliy God bless him and his famliy
We love you technoblade ❤️  الله يرحمك ❤️
TEEWEEWCHHHHNOOOOBLAASDEEEE😭😭😭😭😭
Wow...just..23 so young
This is so sad 😭😭😭😭 omg nooooo!             SIKE! He’s just a rip off of dream 😂😂
No
Used to watch those Mrbeast vids with Techno inside them. Never actually liked him that much but from what I could tell he had a great community who lived him very much. My sincerest condolences to his family.   And for my peeps in the comments. Please don’t reply to those desperate clout sniffing attention seekers in the comments. You will only intensify their self-producing drug-like ego they get from being total bingbongs. Give your attention to the ones who deserve it: Techno, and his family.
L
So sad we lose another legendary gamer, the gaming community will forever remember him I am certain. My heart goes out to his friends and family... May they find solace, happiness, health, love and always have enough. From the bottom of this gamers heart.

"Technonlade never dies" we will miss you so much

Their reporting it as if some people don’t know him… 👋 you’ll live in all our ♥️
he died knowing everyone would miss him :)
Rest in peace technoblade raw remembrance And I like her crown😿
...
We love u technoblade (alex) in my heart
At least we got him to 10 million before he left. He got to see it. I feel like we were able to give a little back, and that thought makes it a little easier.
“Technoblade never dies.”
Lol anything popular these fools on it
Techno never loses the cancer didn’t win it died also so it’s a draw our hero has fallen but will not in our hearts
I’ve never watch his videos but I wish his family the best
R.I.P he is in a better place with gods love and care 🌹🌹
Rip technoblade
RIP
Techno blade never dies
wow, didn't know he'd passed. Rest in peace.
Dang this video is so sad i will miss techno so much
When I saw this yesterday I thought it was a dream I was a supporter since the potato war
He was a victim of cancer but he was still a bad person 😒
I just learned this he was my favorite YouTuber at one point Rest In Peace you will be missed 😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
Sometimes death can be unpredictable. If he was religious then he is on the right way.
An irreparable loss.
I didint watch his videos much but i liked some of the highlights and mrbeast videos were he was sad to see him go just shows to apricciate your health
Techno blade never dies he’s in our hearts and he’s watching us in heaven rest in peace. Lord Tech ❤️❤️💙💙
I used to watch this guy when I was younger
Even having already watched the video on his channel, it’s sad to know he passed 8 hours after he wrote that message, it’s sad to know that he died so young, and it’s sad to see his father hold back all his emotions at losing a talented person he raised. Fly High, Techno.
Life is short, friends... Go the party, say yes to your friends, say yes to seeing the world. We live in a world of constant excuses now, and we need to remind ourselves to just say yes to ourselves... Rest in peace man ❤️
Rip man 😢😢
we all miss you alex.
“To be fair, I could make this a lot weirder. I could make the thumbnail a giant red arrow pointing to my tumor captioned “might die1!1!1! Not clickbait1!1!!1!1!” Oof that did not age well. Fly high Alex.
Iv never watched his videos but the video made by his father on the oh channel made me emotional.
'Technoblade will never die'
”Technoblade never dies” You will always be in our hearts, you won’t be forgotten
"technoblade never dies" Rest easy blood god ❤️
I’m literally shedding tears right now😢😢😢
"Technoblade never dies." We love you Techno <3

I never watched his content or anything, but I did cry when I heard he'd passed on
This was sad but he really touched lives! He inspired and he was brave! Long live Technoblade!!!!
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Nononono he did not 😭
“TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES” We love you Alex ❤️❤️❤️❤️

I was at BSA campout when a girl told me: “technoblade died” I didn’t want to believe it. And the next night a Scout sang “when I ruled the world” as a memorial for him. I… couldn’t believe it. The scouts next to me adopted me to their troop and we were all sad. R.I.P Technoblade.

The statement in the description that states that he never shown his face is false, as he have shown it at least 3 times, before the video by his family.  Rest In Peace, Alexander "Technoblade".
Rest In Peace Technoblade, prayers to all his fans and family. Fly high brother🕊
Technobabble will Never die
"Technoblade never dies."

“Alex never dies”
Hmmm so many YouTubers dying!!
Technoblade, we will miss you. You've made such a impact to us. We'll miss you. You will never be forgotten. "Technoblade never dies."
"Technoblade never dies" he really never will.. he is in our hearts... I feel bad for his family and R.I.P. Must be living in paradise.
❗❗ON THE 5TH JULY WE'RE GONNA DRAW A PIG AND WITH A CROWN ON OUR HANDS TO REMEMBER HIM (pin?)❗❗
R.I.P. techno. Me and my friends didn't know his cancer was serious (since when the last time I heard him talk about it it was in a non sad or serious tone)  Even though I couldn't pray for him when he was alive I'll still pray for his soul
Respekt
Its so hard to accept that he died.
"Technoblade never dies" He will be in our hearts forever
rip
LEGENDS NEVER DIE: RIP King of BedWars

Rest easy - Techno. You have changed so many lives. o7
He will always be in my heart i liked minecraft bec of him he was the best and when i heard my heart broke into pieces😔
Rip one of my fav yt
I feel like this was made only to capitalize on us, fans. If you have nothing to say, and you clearly don't, I don't want to hear from you. Yes, you have a reach, but every one who sees this video either already knew about it or don't care. You even fail to mention minecrafters vs cancer thing!
I'm not a fan of Technoblade but I know he made lots of people happy including some of my friends you'll be missed by many, r.i.p Technoblade.
One of the best things about dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he achieves something he olwys respect use the audience and his team and he is always polite in all of his video we congratulate ourselves on his achievement more to come and everything __🔔🔥
Techno is already plotting to overthrow god
Rest in peace Technoblade we will forever miss you. We all love you dude.
Techno never die 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
God damn... He definitely brought some memories 😭

Remove his face smh, the family wanted his face/identity private to honor his last wishes, he only face revealed to his fans not to the whole world,  not being a karen im just saying
”Technoblade never dies”  hope that was true
Mad respect for techno for what he has done and may his soul rest in peace.
I even knew about his diagnosis before he died :(
….We will miss you techno and you’ll always hold a place in our hearts and soul..truly..Technoblade never dies because of that.
Alex died but……teachnoblade never dies
You will always be the king of minecraft, no one will be able to reach your heights. Blood for the blood god!
Technoblade is one of the best minecraft players if he had 1M hearts I would rather him be Technoblade again r.i.p Technoblade
LMFAO EVEN INSIDE EDITION MADE A VIDEO ABOUT TECHNOBLADE
I’ve never really liked the dream smp but seeing people mock and make fun of techno for dying and having cancer is sickening and inhumane. If you make fun of a dead person/ cancer patient, go to hell.
😥😥😥😥😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
RIP Technoblade: *he maybe gone,but like Edd,he will always be in our hearts* "Technoblade Never Dies"
I did NOT expect this to be on inside edition..

I was never a fan of techno blade, ive lost a lot of family members that died from cancer and knowing that he did too hits hard.. Never watched his videos but knew he was important to the minecraft society that that a lot of people loved him and that he loved them back, techno will always be remembered from his fans, family, and people that didn't even watch him, Rest in peace techno blade.. 💔
TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES
He revealed his name in the steering wheel video
Although he may be dead his legacy is not and will remain strong for decades to come. Rest In Peace
I was crying thinking of him dead ever since he had cancer. Never knew it would actually happen.
Omg I thought this was one of those stupid clickbait videos until i saw it was inside edition. I’m not really into Minecraft but I’ve heard of technoblade. Never knew he had cancer. May he rest in peace.
He has showed hi face 3 time
I just can’t believe it.
no way dude, this is insane, i knew he had cancer but i didnt think he would go so soon. RIP a youtube legend
I’m gonna cry now.
Rip Techno
The sad part is he died and I believe there is a vaccine being developed for cancer
RIP techno
Thought he said “techno blade never dies”
"Someone once said that when you die from cancer, the cancer dies too. That's not a loss- that's a draw. Technoblade never loses, and ever now, Technoblade never dies. His legacy lives on, and it always will... though the lives he touched and the content he created. Rest in peace."❤️❤️
Technoblade will never be forgotten because TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES
Now that he has taken down all DSMP governments, he has ascended to beat God. He’s probably laughing at all us nerds for crying over a Minecraft pig  Stay strong, guys. It’ll be alright <3
rest in peace man
TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES! Technoblade never dies as long as he remains in our hearts.
Long live the king, the Real King. Fly High🕊

Who?
Feels weird seeing this on the news, o7 Blood God. Technoblade never dies 👑
Dude was my childhood
Guys technoblade is not dead
This literally added nothing just qoute reading the family asked for it not be blown everywhere
To be honest I really wasn't expecting that video... When I first saw it (the title) I thought that he was going to leave YouTube temporarily to take care of himself or something, I didn't expect a goodbye.. I thought he was getting better actually.. I guess I was wrong. But even if techno is gone physically I know he is not fully gone as he said "Technoblade never dies". You may have lived a short life but you have lived a wonderful one, thank you for everything King Techno! 😉❤❤
Rip the god of hypixel
REST IN PEACE,
🐷👑LONG LIVE THE BLADE
Rest in peace Technoblade🙏 the greatest Minecrafter that ever lived and you always will be. No one could ever replace you💗. An amazing role model to so many young people. His life may have been short but it touched so many people, rest well👑. Technoblade never dies!

Rip tecno
But people will still be disgusting under his video. When the final video came out, I watched it after a few minutes of its release. I went to the comments and saw one comment which was something like :  Techno’s dad : I got down on my knees Me : Dirty mind  Like bro wtf,  this is not the time to sexualise anything! A man just died and his father is talking about his son he lost less than a week ago, show some respect.
Im happy for hin he has had the happiest life pobersal but it ended shortly
I won't forget him, he _literally_ taught me Minecraft!!
Rest well king,  You have done enough for your people...
I Miss Technoblade I hope Hes Good on Heaven
You will live on forever 😢

Technoblade never dies!!!!
Technoblade never dies.
o7 Techno
Technoblade never truly dies. Not in our hearts. He'll always be the blood god in our eyes. Whether you know him during the dream smp or not, you'll still know he's a legend to all of us. I just can't imagine how his sister and friends feel.
”Technoblade never dies”  Don't worry guys he's caputuring heaven or probably captured it and laughing at us rn.
RIP technoblade I love you so much and now your not here with your family and to enjoy life as a YouTuber and with your family. I love you so much Alex. your my number one fan I've been with you sence you have started YouTube and I will still keep eating your videos even if your not here. I love you so much technoblade 😪😣😓😞😭😖
He’s already inside INSIDE EDITION only 2 days?!? I mean I’m not mad I’m happy but sad…
I love that Wilbur is just in the back round
“May Technoblade Soar in Heaven with his new Elytra, Rest In Peace.”
REST IN PIECE YOU WERE THE BEST I WILL STILL WATCH YOUR BED WARS LIVE STREAMS AND I WILL WATCH THE VIDEOS WITH YOU AND DREAM AFTER YOUR PASS😭❤

I CHOOSE BLOOD-technoblade technoblade will be in our hearts
Can't have good things anymore
technoblade I your fan why you go away technoblade 😢😭
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Technoblade😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This is the most saddest thing ever rip
I never really watched  technoblade or the dream smp but this is still sad and he looks like a pushed through and tried to continue witch is what a hero would do
"Technoblade never dies" He was and is a Legend, I can't imagine how much pain his family and close friends might be feeling at the moment, let's remember him for what he had done for everyone. We were lucky to have him, he's probably trying to beat God as we speak.
Not me crying during his father's speech
Technoblade never dies
🔥🔥🔥 These fires came while listening 🎧...
TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!
I'm glad that his channel was able to reach 10 million before he dies.

If I had another 100 lives, I think I would be a fan of Technoblade in all of them, as those were the happiest years of my life.

"technoblade never dies"   and he won't, not in a million years, because he's still alive in the hearts and the minds of every gaming geek and community out there.
Ever since he annouced he had cancer, I thought "Oh well that's probably just a small problem, he'll be fine." but that didn't happen. Rest easy, Techno.

RIP
It was hard to watch his last video without breaking down in tears.
You even hear the reporter almost crying
Nobody was prepared for this, but there is always something that we will never forget, and it is that that " Technoblade never dies!"
So long nerd. I'll  meet you . Soon
So sorry for your loss Dad.
I barely knew about this person. But damn I gotta admit he shouldn't have died so soon, and seeing how he was able to still turn his own catastrophic events into comedic relief is  admirable. It's really hard to do so.
When a legend is born, it never dies.
My heart hurts over this
I've never really been a technoblade fan, but, I've still adored what he's done. It might not be today, or tomorrow that we realize that no matter what, technoblade deserves our respect. RIP Technoblade.
Techno Never Dies: but it’s terrible Karl tweeted on twitter about it and everyone is devastated especially MrBeast and dream  Rip Legend
hear comes the kids  who make vids about technoblade death for  clout and dont even care about his death

Technoblade never dies
“Technoblade never dies” Thank you for the all the memories you created for us may you fly high and Rest In Peace you will forever be apart of our lives and childhood we miss you very very much. 🕊🤍
I had never watched him, I'm not big into Minecraft, but I do watch streamers and I know they can have HUGE effects on our lives. Watching streams has helped me through periods of bad anxiety and depression. I'm sure he helped a lot of people and brought happiness to them. He did what he loved. Seemed like a good man, very sad he passed on so quickly. Rest in peace brother, you'll be okay.  "Do not pity the dead. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love." - Dumbledore
Noooooo :(
Technoblade Never Dies, Rest In Peace Technoblade and thank you for everything ❤

"Technoblade never dies"  and will remain one of the greatest minecraft player in history
Its even on inside edition
his dad tried so hard not to cry, i tried so hard not to cry too but still cried.
Technoblade was a pure soul. To be a YouTube sensation and a beloved icon of Minecraft must of been crazy. But being able to carry that type of care and love over to the real world and be able to make people's lives better whether he knew them or not, is a skill very few have. Most people adapt to the internet to escape real life but this dude managed to bring them together and help people. Rest in Paradise Technoblade.
Noooooooooooooooooo😭😭😭😭😭
He never dies, he's just resting in peace.
Dream casually speedruns minecraft now techno speedrunning life
I’m crying rn 😭😭🐷👑
May the king rest well up there. Technoblade never dies. Forever in our hearts.
This shocked me to the core 😭
It hits so hard to realize that we’ve been living in the good ol’ days

Noo is on the news this means it's real '-'
RIP KING
Technoblade is gone but not forgotten
RIP Legeng
At some points, even today, I've teared up because he has impacted my life that much. It's kind of an unhealthy habit, I suppose, to look up these kinds of videos about Technoblade but I just can't help myself. I feel like everyone relates to me and once I've fully accepted his death and his last words I would want to donate to the charity he loved most, buy his latest merch, and participate in the Hypixel Technoblade memorial. I haven't been in the mood for my hobbies and other things so that tells me I need time. Hopefully Technoblade's parents come back from this soon because it would make me sad to see them suffer more than they already have.
Heartbreaking...watching this after telling my 11 years old son about hearing this on radio news yesterday...my boy said it sounds like technoblade..well we looked it up and saw this video sympathy to the  family  of this very special man.
We will never forget u Technoblade thank you for ur amazing content
techno never dies, he will always be watching us  and his family from above, he's in a better place now, rest in piece our God.

Technoblade never dies 🐷👑
"Technoblade never dies" those words live with us every day, he will never die in our hearts ❤️ we miss you technoblade, may you Rest In Peace now... 😢😭
technoblade the blood god will never die
Even after his death he gets 1 million subs in a day
TENCOBLADE DIED???!!
”The Blade Never Dies”  May he res in piece
this was written in a book, in minecraft and given to tommyinnit before he died: “Tell the rest of the SMP that having abolished all governments of men, i have ascended to heaven to take on the Kingdom of God “ - Technoblade
He was just too good for our world. He has moved on to the after life to find a good challenger in another world. 😢
Technoblade never die, you will be in our heart ❤️
Techno helped me so much through hard times in my life. I am truly so sad.
It kinda funny seeing the news talk about him considering his personality, I never watched him frequently I found him through a youtube add he made about 5-6 years back honestly can’t remember my favourite videos from him were his tapL tnt skyward collab he probably had less than 100k back then. Then once he blew up and started challenging hillary clinton in sub count was about when I stopped. Knowing how he came from youtube ads all the way to going on the news it’s nice.
RIP, Technoblade ❤️
Rip
They even got people like inside edition on this, really goes to show how much of an absolute legend this guy was. Rest in peace, best minecraft youtuber ever 👑 👑 👑
RIP
This is very tragic indeed, and so young! Does anybody here knows what type of cancer? I would really like to do some research on it and the cause. Probably, hereditary?
"Technoblade never dies" He is still playing Minecraft in heaven. His legend will never stop.
Never heard of him...but dying to cancer at that age may be the direct result of spending too much time playing that filthy game while ignoring simple things such as exercise 🤦.. Not surprising
LEGENDS NEVER DIE
Technoblade never dies, Long live the blood god!!!
god damn it why cant i escape it
I liked watching him rest in peace
I watched this video over an hour ago and wanted to comeback and comment, Im not sure whether I’ve watched any of his videos before but while watching this video and even thinking about it afterwards I couldnt help but cry. Just the thought had my throat aching to scream and cry. I have no idea why but its just so upsetting to see someone go like that and care so much about his fans so dearly. May he rest in peace💔
TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!!!!!!!!!

As a big Dream SMP fan, I was heartbroken,and shocked to hear the news. I thought it was a joke, but then I watched the video. And I'm telling the truth right now, I cried nonstop for Hours. I couldn't believe My idol,was gone.I wanted it to be a dream,but it isnt. I watched him all my childhood,and laughed at every video. Cancer really sucks,and no one should have to go through it. My deepest condolences to Alex's family. He was taken away from us too early. And it breaks my heart,that some people out there,had to also lose their loved ones due to this Horrible thing we call Cancer. Fly High Technoblade. You did enough for us. Now,you can rest, with no worries. I hope that up there,your being taken care of. We all love you Alex. Rest now,You've earned it. June 1,1999-June 30,2022 🕊
:( R.I.P
Rest in paradise legend.

So sadddddddddddddddddddd
We finally get to see his face, but at what cost?
Hellllllllllllllllllllooooooooooooooooo
Technoblade passed away but his legend will lives
Well it’s a bit surreal but “technoblade never dies”
Some people of my family have died of cancer and it is very hard to tell others the death of this person when someone never knew.
Despite the fact I never knew him, his death breaks my heart and after watching Philza build the statue and knowing how much he and his family and friends and hurting I shed my tears alone 4 minutes to 3am Alex may no longer be with us but his memory will last   “A million years”
I wonder who is going to take over Technoblade when he is not around on his channel
It's hilarious to know that Inside Edition didn't know that Techno showed his face a number of years ago and it was just a running gag between Techno and his og fans.
hes up there fighting whatever is waiting for him, and hes winning.
Cancer has taken so many famous lives but this one will be never forgotten r.i.p
Always heard about him, gone too soon.
Why putting on this video ads
You know techo's death had a big impact on the internet when a news channel decided to make a video on his death
“Gamers never die, they respawn in an upper dimension”
petition  to storm heaven, jump god,  bring tech back >:(
Technoblade is amazing
You'll never be forgotten, for all the funny and awsome things you did Technoblade. "Technoblade never dies."
"tecnoblade never dies"i wish it was true:(
This man has changed millions of life’s and now we will miss him so much and the amount of tears I’ve cried could probably fill a pool Rest In Peace techno❤️
And I had just finished crying...
o7
This is just sad.

I realised technos Chanel is doing better after his death :( I wonder why he’s coming more popular after he died. It’s sad that he died.
Technoblade never dies, RIP
Not a fan of minecraft youtube but he was a funny guy based on his update videos. Cancer sucks and always sad to hear someone died from it.

Say sike say sike right now
All hail Tecnho o7
Ok, but one thing i never get is when people say he "never revealed his face." Theres been live video from him before. Hes shown his face, it just wasnt a big deal and wasnt directly right up to the camera.  Instead, remember this instead: he wore a basketball shooting sleeve to hide his elbow in live video segments and had an elbow reveal.
Ever since I heard he died I could not stop crying
You know it’s hard to think that a youtuber you love and care about so much just get pulled away from you. Rest In Peace technoblade you will always be our king.🐷👑
;(
Oml i just found out about this from my brother i cabt believe it.    Rip techno :( 💙
Please say sike

Rip technoblade. And was that juicy fruit snacks
(Technoblade never dies) is a statement from all of our heart  Goodbye technoblade
Ima cry now, he was a legend.  I watched his videos. He was the 3rd generation of mincraftubers and a legend.  Ima go to an online lobby now to attend his virtual minecraft funeral and shrine.
The one Minecraft YouTuber that wasn't a pedo
Rip Alex your a king
technoblade was such a legend he was on the news
Techno didn't die, he just put down his crown and is now resting in peace
Technoblade IS 23 years old not was
"Technoblade never dies" chain never heard of him and im not much of a mc guy, but I have watched him before. RIP TECHNO
Dang Edd died, and now Techno? Condolences for Techno's family.
Technoblade was a legend
Hail Mary, full of Grace, the LORD is with Thee.  Blessed art Thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of Thy womb, JESUS.  Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.  Amen.
We will meet him soon in paradise
He made it to the news

It so sad because he died at a young age
Technoblade's a legend.... He is our angel forever
RIP Technoblade And "Technoblade never dies boys" he will be always remembered
I knew he had things going on with him but I didn’t know it was cancer😔😭 rip techno
I can't believe he died 😥😥
RIP sir I didn't watch your content but I knew you without watching so in my eyes that meant you had to be someone important to the youtube community and made very entertaining content. YouTube is a part of my life that is almost like a whole different world you know. It's like my true genuine escape from everyone and everything and I'd say that's how it is for most of everyone so to those who actively watched your content my heart goes out to you most. For me the content creator that introduced this feeling of escape from life was a YouTuber who went by the alias X who played minecraft. X's adventure in minecraft is what I looked forward to watching more than anything ever. I can say the same for other creators like GMM and Vannoss crew and Jack pewds and Mark. I'd be like losing a part of myself. Like a part of something greater than day to day life. I depend on thier content for happiness and joy. So when they pass those feelings go alongside the fallen legends. I cried when angry grandpa passed I cried when householdhacker passed. I cried when Grant Thompson of King of random passed. I wish for good health and for prosperity to all
Gone from our sight, but never from our hearts
😭
😭😭😭 RIP
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO:(
we LOVE TCHNOBLADE
RIP Technoblade 🙏
Technoblade never dies..  In our hearts
Wait he just died a few hours ago???? I thought he dies long times ago?

Rest In Peace 💕

You know ... knowing his personality a little bit I think he'd really enjoy getting eaten up by Inside Edition. He'd probably make a joke about them being maggots festering over his dead body. What a legend.
Man such a young age 😭😭😭rip young man

R.I.P King of P.v.p

I didn't knew that he was the Minecraft YouTuber I was watching before when I was a kid, I was so astonished and impressed by his PVP skills, now that I grew up, I missed out that he has cancer... Yesterday in the morning, my sister told me about his death, and that got me speechless because this is the Man that made my childhood playing Minecraft, my childhood was wild and full of imagination because of him, God bless you Techno/Alex 🙏❤️
Technoblade…. Never dies
I never thought technoblade would get on the news much less because of this
RIP buddy! ❤️🕊

See I never heard of this YouTuber until just now the only one Popular YouTuber I know is popularMMOs. But this whole thing here is extremely sad but least Technoblade will be missed and is now in a happy place.
I found this out on roblox adopt me board
TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES HES STILL LIVES IN OUR HEARTS!!!!!
*SAAAALUUUUTTTTE*
They have ads on this video, Inside Edition be profiting off of this. Yiiikes.
A man is never dead until he is forgotten, and in this case, Technoblade is immortal. Alex may be dead, but as they say, Techno never dies.
"If you're watching this. I am dead"  so no respawn? lmao
wdym he died? only his mere human form perished, his legendary sole is posesing another body, another Technoblade shall arise!
"If your watching this, I'm dead."  I cried for hours straight after that.
Technoblade never dies
Rip legend
"Technoblade never dies" he will live on in our hearts.
No one will ever forget you
technoblade aint dying anytime soon
"Technoblade never dies"R.I.P Technoblade,we miss u so much❤❤
We lost a true legend technoblade always made every ones day and made a lot us laugh. Rip technoblade
I think he should be called Minecraft Legend instead of popular Minecraft youtuber
I've been watching him since 2016, and only realised how young he really is
1 down, 9 left.
Rip technoblade
Technoblade doesn't dies he is still in our hearts
“Techno blade never dies”🤍
At first when I saw the video title I thought he was leaving YouTube and know I wish that was what happened, when I heard the news I couldn't believe it, I just couldn't, I just thought this was some sort of sick joke and that later in the video he'd appear and be like it was all a joke and he was actually OK, unfortunately that wasn't the case, even still, I can't come to terms with the fact that he is no longer here, may Alex rest in peace, the blade will never die as long as we keep his memory alive R. I. P
he had 10 million 10h ago
R.I.P Technoblade, you will forever be remembered
No no no no NOOOOO!!!!
i never thought this day would come
My son told me about this, he was fairly upset about it. He was lucky enough to buy a sweater, its precious to him now
NOO BRO OMG HOLY
rip
“Legends never die”
he had 10.4m subs before death, why did 1.1m sub now?
BRO
He face had already been revealed in a video about beating Minecraft with a steering wheel and when he had died he only had 10.4 million subscribers. Just want to get all the facts straight
Noooooooo 😭😭😭😭
Blessings from everyone of YouTube and minecraft 🙏
i haven’t watched him in years but man, i have so much respect & love for him. rest easy <3
blood for the blood god!!
See ya… nerd…
That’s crazy, wow man.
"Technoblade never dies"  He may be gone, but yet never truly as his memories and legacy live kne with his family and friends. And to us, his fans we keep the king memories alive and show that he truly never dies
:(
It's hard for perants. You go through live thinking your children will be at your funeral, not the other way around. Did not know him but his family loved each other
Captian technoblade nerver dies I well never forget you captien

And to think I’m 23. I remember seeing him from a f1nn5ter video for the first time and i liked him ever since. Poor guy cancer is disgusting
Techno always made my days as a kid. Now growing up I can’t believe I won’t hear his amazing jokes or how inspiring he was. He will always have a place in my heart no matter what and nobody can say otherwise. Praying for his family 🙏❤️
As his final words he once said to us is:"Technoblade never dies"
He will live in a memories as a legend RIP technoblade 🕊🕊
We will always remember him in our hearts Legends never die.
Rip legend your revolution goes on
Hearing people reading there own final notes before passing is sad
Still processing that he actually died.
Rip tech

TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES
My best friend loved his videos so we both decided to do a moment of silence for this man.
It sucks to se how cancer took away someone so young and precious, Alex entertained us all even when he was struggling with cancer just to make his fans happy. Technoblade never dies.
I don't know much about Technoblade, I'm not really into Minecraft content, but I honestly feel really bad for his family, friends, and his fanbase. Rest in peace, Techno, you will be missed by millions.
Rip techno blade 😞😞😭😭
I've seen the video, R.I.P. my friend...🙏😔
May his soul rest in peace

This is insane.. I haven’t watched him in so long and never heard about this until now… it’s heartbreaking.
I don't watch minecraft except for certain videos, once in a while from a few YouTubers, which includes Mr beast, which is also how I know of him. Seemed pretty cool. Rip
Rest in peace, Technoblade. May you beat the Kingdom of God.

Rest in peace 🕊🕊
I can’t stop thinking and just crying about it it’s just crazy to think how someone you hardly know could change you and impact everyone around them. Techno definitely had a huge foot print in this world that we can’t simply forget. His phrase  “Techno blade never dies” still holds true he will forever live in our hearts and minds and will go down in history.   Thank you Alex (Technoblade) for all the memories you will be missed and we love you. Rest easy. 💕  Love, Josí
The way his father spoke his final message to his fans without tearing up honestly made me tear up. He knew he had to be strong for his sons audience. Rest easy techoblade

He only truly dies when he’s forgotten. Which will never. Happen. Rest in peace, technoblade.

Appreciate how positive he stayed even though he had cancer. He still made videos as he was diagnosed. He still made a funny video title on his last video. He still gave us a final message when he didn’t have to.  Rest easily, Techno.

Didn’t like him but ppl shouldn’t make fun of this
"If you're watching this. I am dead"  Wow, that hits extremely hard and just echoes in my head over and over. Even knowing his time was near... he fought on and still gave to us 8 hours before passing. Rest In Peace <3

He seriously was such an awesome an hilarious guy. I send all my prayers to his family, friends, and to his legacy that shall live on. I hope anybody reading this can try to donate to cancer research charities, and charities that would help aid people that go through horrible things like this. We love you king!

🥺😶
R.I.P techno blade you will be missed. You have left a mark on not only the minecraft community but his fans and most importantly his family thanks technoblade for the laughs and entertainment
Thank you so much for making a fairly simple and respectful video regarding this sort of news.  Even though I’ve only known him since either in 2020 or 2021, he’s become so important to me and I wish I had enough courage and dedication to see his every update and his previous streams. His voice, attitude, skills, antics, dynamic with everyone he knows, etc. were just so amazing that after just a few streams and clips, I had become so enamored by him. He’ll always be one of the most memorable people in my life and I’ll make sure to remember that someone like him had existed and blessed us with so much in such a short amount of time.  Thank you, Techno. For giving to us, being yourself, accepting us, and have managed to inspire and brought us feelings and vibes that some or even one of us never realized could have existed. Wish I could’ve said this on the farewell video comments section but here it is, I guess.
🪦💐🌷🙏😔

"Technoblade never dies"  Thank you Techno for all the joy you gave us. R.I.P 👑
Sleep well Blood God💕
My 13 year old son told me today he "never gets sad," then followed by "until today" and shared about his passing. He must be that great of a guy. May he rest in peace.
RIP God bless the family
RIP techno 🙏😭 Techno Never Dies
RIP Techno but we all know “TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES”
W
Man.... that's sad. Young young young. Stop and smell the roses y'all.
Technoblade never dies
He shall be always remembered in our hearts something special to commemorate him we must do
Anyone can say whatever they want but if you upload a video about this kind of topic, it’s absolutely disgusting in my opinion that you even dare to put ads on it. Shame  RIP Techno❤️ This world isn’t the same with you gone
"Technoblade never dies" because he is a legend that will be in our memories and hearts. He was an amazing Minecraft YouTuber, he was always positive and could always crack a joke, the Minecraft community has lost a piece of greatness now that he is gone. He will be greatly missed. 💔💖
Technoblade never dies.. or technoblade never dies without a fight.
rest in peace
I cried a lot man.😭 rest easy king.😔
The fact that i thought this is hoax made me cry
R.I.P techno  You will be always remembered
Thank you for everything Technoblade. May you rest in peace
Techno never dies and fly high 🕊💔❤️‍🩹
Rest in Peace Techno, we all miss you so much.
He never had his own kid to raise, but he raised many others throughout the world
For me, it was most telling that right up to the last hours he was focused on making sure his community was as good as it could, allowed to grieve and process with a warm parting message craking jokes, as well as raising funds for cancer and his family.  The idea that he carried himself with that level of grace and warmth up to his last moments at the age of 23 is litereally awe inspiring to me. Potato Wars is the best MC YT content ever, GOAT. RIP Techno.     and Thank you
Technoblade I will miss you
Technoblade will never go down without a fight👑 in the end he went down. But so did the cancer. It was one final draw⚔️👑🕊❤️Technoblade never loses. Technoblade will never die, In our hearts❤️
I dont know "Technoblade" but its easy to see what a wonderful and positive and creative guy this is. His dad and family must be so proud of him.
God Bless His Soul In Peace.
I wonder if there's people will milk his death as content?

I haven’t really ever watched Techno or any Minecraft youtubers but I know my sister really really loves watching mcyt and Technoblade had definitely been one of her favorites. She has been down in the dumps all day like she’s not super affectionate, especially to me, but today she asked me for a hug multiple times and I didn’t know why. My heart is hurting after watching this and putting the pieces together; I mean I’m tearing up and I didn’t even watch his videos, Rest In Peace
Here
Technoblade never dies”You will be remembered.
I used to play Minecraft when I was 13 years old
Rest in peace technoblade and we love you all Minecraft player from Philippines

Rest in piece, I am at a loss of words, you meant so much to so many people.

Man I didn't know him much from his channel but just hearing his father's heartbreaking story actually hurts I hurt for him, a real tear jerker. Rip Alex.
10 months ago we all cried because you revealed you have cancer, we we're all shocked by the news but we we're there by your side, some months later you said you're gonna be ok and you have a high chance of surviving, now im writing this in your memory. May you rest in the paradise Alexander ❤️

Technoblade was the best Minecraft youtuber I ever watched, it's devastating to see him go at such a young age. Fly high techno
All of the fans will miss
Rest in Peace Technoblade. I'll miss his sense of humor, it always made me laugh. His videos always brought a smile to my face even if I wasn't having the greatest of days.  You will be greatly missed youtube will be really different without you.
Rest In Peace technoblade. Inside edition stop taking news people already know. It’s copy right. It’s probably now what technoblade wanted because he only needed his fans and more to know so stop spreading stuff that ain’t yours
I respect the news for puting this out here.  "technoblade never dies"
Rest in peace technoblade
Technoblade will forever be in our hearts 💕 Rest In Peace Technoblade

R.I.P Techno
Its hard for a parent to tell their son that its okay to let go. You fought long and hard and its okay to let go. One of the hardest decision any parent has to make.
"Technoblade never dies" is true because when he dies the cancer dies too so the cancer didn't win Technoblade did
❤️❤️❤️
technoblade never dies!!!! 🎗
Glad that all of YouTube is taking their time to pay their respects
Fly high Techno 🕊

Prayers to his loved ones and family. May the legend Rest In Piece. Life is short so make it as long as possible. May you rest easy Alex.  ♥️
Rest in peace technoblade :-(
Where was he from? I’m hearing a slight Canadian accent
He impacted so many lives with his humor and personality and he was just a great person overall. Rest In Peace to the king.
I can feel the dads pain.. Sending prayers to his family, friends and even Technoblade himself
I wasn’t a huge fan of Him but dude this reminded me so much of a family friend who passed I cried for like 5 mins so I hope his family is good
To be honest, I was kinda shocked. He died at such a young age
:(
He will always be remembered in our hearts rip techno
Technoblade is a true legend that will never be forgotten
Long live a Minecraft King. Technoblade will always be apart of the minecraft community.

He will never be forgotten. So many people grew up with him.
Technoblade never dies
Rest in peace legend❤️You will be missed but not forgotten!!😭
Prayers for comfort...Do you think there's an afterlife? It's deep in our hearts we yearn for lover/security, only God can provide this. God loves the world, gave His Son Jesus (unto death for our sins), whoever believes will not die but have everlasting life. John3:16 Please think about it. Repent/belive before the rapture, before the one world government. Jesus died for you. Love
Fly high Techno o7
Techno may have died, but he will never truly die in mine and so many other peoples hearts. I will forever be grateful for him cause he saved mine and multiple other peoples lives on multiple occasions.

I thought everything would work as a happy ending not always but maybe it is he rest well we cry and wish him well :( we all miss him and wish he was back I wanna say god bless him and god bless you all I thought we would all see each other in heaven and that’s the way it’s headed❤️ so long techno…💔 thank you for being in my childhood if your seeing this I’m sorry and wish you well god bless you all… bye💔

My only words for him   o7
🐷👑
Nooooo why u dies I am so sad we Miss you
No parent should have to bury their child....
I as a fellow anarchist would like to say a few words for the community.  You see. I was tired of listening to society. But I was forced to do it.    That was...until I watched him  I always heard about this man and the dream Smp. And since I lost interest in Minecraft I didn't pay any thought to it..until one day I decided. To hell with it. And I watched one of his videos. I was shocked to see somebody who was actually defied society and it's rules. And just was a funny man..he was kinda..like me. Making wisecracks and jokes just for the hell of it. Being a sarcastic man just because he can. He's the reason I decided to throw away societies rules. He proved to me that despite being a kid. I was still in control In my life. And no matter what people say. My choices matter.  And so. I stand here today. Mourning the man that brought out the best in me. Hypixel better make a god forsaken statue for this man in their server's. And someone better take care of his potato farm  Rest in peace technoblade... we'll miss you. Tell the ultimate warrior I said hi
"Technoblade never dies" You'll always be in my heart, techno. Rest in peace.
the news hit me like a bus.  i am so sorry to Alex Technoblade's family for their loss, fly high techno
"Technoblade never dies"  what a legend

"Technoblade never dies" You will never be forgotten and will remain a legend till the end of time ♥️
"Technoblade Never Dies" Yes you will never die in our hearts 😭😭😭😭
RIP Technoblade 🕊☹️
23, wow, he was just a kid!
Rip technoblade he will never die in our hearts
When I heard the news I started crying immediately. We love you techno😭  Edit: Im crying
For those who do not know techno, he’s an minecraft content creator, with a focus/ speciality of pvp (player vs player) he is extremely popular do to his amazing sense of humour, and his ability to put himself in hilarious scenarios.  He comes off as very genuine, and seemingly never forced a fake personality in front of camera.  We loved him because that, and so much more.
I don’t know if this would be a good idea but I feel like Minecraft mondays should now be named something after Technoblade man. 🙏🏼❤️
Techno! Techno! You’ve made it on the news big guy! Even if your gone from earth, your taking over the Kingdom of God! Keep flying mate 🕊
Rest in piece, Technoblade.  Everyone, fan, friend, or non of the above, will remember him
“Techno blade never dies”R.I.P you will be in our hearts for ever
he had shown his face when he beat the game with a stearing wheel
Irving copi
Never heard of him but damn this is sad. RIP Alex ❤️❤️❤️
"or show his face" is that a joke
he was one of my greatest inspirations, but like he said "Technoblade Never Dies!". He will never die for he will always be in the hearts, minds, content and memories of his friends, family and colleges. Thank you Technoblade for everything you did in your short but fulfilling time on this earth, now rest peacefully without pain and enjoy you're everlasting life up above doing the things you love and never forget everyone loves you dearly and you will be greatly missed but never forgotten <3 Sending everyone lots of love and hugs
Never watched him, however I hope he will rest in peace.

Rip Alex you were the same age of me and you did so much in your short life and I wish you could’ve been here much longer I’ve seen my family die from cancer and it’s just not fair to anyone to have to go through what you went through rest easy you beautiful soul.
technoblade never dies, not in our hearts
"Technoblade Never Dies"  He will never be gone, cause we all will carry him with us for the rest of our lives.
Rest easy technoblade we will miss you😔❤️
Nooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm sorry 😂😂😂 I thought it said "Popular Mexican youtuber" and I was like "what? This fool white asf" sorry bless his family.
wait wtf is this real am a bit late
never heard of him till now, but that did not stop the tears 😢😢
Nah techno just left us to troll God. Godspeed you magnificent bastard.
R.I.P technoblade
He has gone to Minecraft World
May he rest in peace🕊️  And live forever in our hearts💔
Rest In Peace I never really watched him but always liked him. I hope for the best for his family. I know how much he did for people and don’t want to be mean but maybe it is f9r the best. One last time Rest In Peace 🕊
I-
My kids were fans, I never saw any of his videos but I heard the name mentioned by my kids a lot  my daughter came downstairs from her room last night crying and I had to find out what was wrong. I watched the video his father posted and got choked up. No parent should ever have to suffer outliving their child.
noooooooooooooooooo
You don't beat Dream with no repercussions. Dream #1
Technoblade is a legend man legends never die (sign) Legends do not die.
This is so sad :( I haven’t ever been a fan on the dream SMP but my best friend has been for a long time. (This story will be very long so I just wanted to say Rest In Peace 🕊)  My friend normally stays up until 2 AM, or 1 AM, or at least 12. But last night I messaged her around 11:30, to no response. I knew she would be going on a trip this weekend, but I didn’t think she would leave Friday (I presumed she would go to be early for her trip), but when I texted her the next morning, she didn’t reply and it just left me on delivered (this almost never happens with her) so I didn’t think That much of it at first. Like I said, I haven’t ever watched techno blade or the dream SMP, but friends from my group chat have, so at around 8:45 in the morning, they were all saying stuff like “rest in peace techno” or “fly high techno blade 🕊” and stuff like that. When I thought he had just died in Minecraft, (I asked them) they said he and actually passed away. I felt really guilty for saying that, and I felt really bad for my friend, to, as she had mercy and stuff (again I don’t know if she liked techno or not, but this had to impact her because she would watch ranboo almost everyday) and it finally clicked that that may have been the reason she wasn’t responding. I don’t know this for sure but that’s my speculation.  Anyways, may techno, or Alex Rest In Peace 🕊❤️‍🩹and to anyone else who is suffering from this, rather it be all his fans, family, friends, colleagues, or fellow peers, just know that he is resting peacefully in heaven 🕊 May he Rest In Peace for all eternity 🕊🫶🏻🙏
Long live the King
Rest in peace Technoblade, we will remember you forever
R.I.P

As a long time technoblade fan when I woke up to that news I was shook, I couldn’t believe it, I spent all day just in my room crying and now it’s just a fact that he’s no longer on the earth. My condolences go to his family, friends, and fans as they all work through this tragedy. You will never be forgotten king.
Guys don’t worry techno is probably 1v1’ing god as we speak rn
He’s not dead just in a better place then earth there he will rest In heaven. Heaven has gained an Angel 😇  Stay strong 💪🏻 ❤️😭
Why so soon, he didn't deserve it, though even if he isn't here physically, he still never dies in spirit.

"Techoblade Never Dies."  -Technoblade   Rest In Peace Alexander, only had a short life of 23 years, 1999-2022.   "He was a great YouTuber, but Why does everybody we love have to die? This changes the gaming community forever, though he wasn't a roblox guy like I am, I watched him so he can cheer me up and entertain me. He was a very popular creator and was very kind. He Inspired hundreds and thousands of creators to start creating. He made his mark in the world. No parent nor family should ever have to go through this. Nobody should die that young. Hopefully, he's flying high above the clouds."  -DatGavinDude Goodbye, Technoblade.
"Technoblade never dies" he properly finding ways to destroy god
Here’s a poem to mr technoBlade.  So where do I begin, He was a king, No matter his condition, No matter what he faced, He perceived, But even if he not here, He’s still here in the books, Of Minecraft’s great’s.  - may he rest in peace.
Even for the last moment of his life he still makes jokes
A man might have died, but the crown has not dropped, his legacy will live on.  death is forgotten with a legacy of the past, influencing the future.
Technoblade is truly an inspiration. His heart and humor never wavered and he impacted millions of people, be it by lifting others up or simply giving them a smile. Rest in peace, Technoblade. Your legacy will truly never die. ❤️
rip

Rip
He actually did show his face a couple years ago in “cooking with technoblade”, a video you can still see on his channel.  Regardless, he was an amazing person who touched many young people’s lives and gave consolation in a time where that was needed.  He will be long remembered and sorely missed. 🫡

"Technoblade never dies"
Knowing him, he probably chose the title of the video. RIP Technoblade 😭
HUGE jump in all-cause mortality in young people after the rollout of "safe and effective".

Popular is an understatement  He was an absolute legend
Techno would love to have know that he would make it on inside edition, he’s probably make a joke like “oh, I wasn’t famous until I was on inside edition, but NOW. I’m unstoppable”. Dude is so powerful, he’s getting free clout and he’s not even here  <3
Fly high technoblade

Wow congrats no one gives a 💩
I never really watched his videos, but this still makes me cry.
Let’s all make our profile pictures techno blade for the rest of the week to honor him Techno blade never dies
RIP TO HIM 💔💔💔💔💔😭😪😢
Wait it was real nooooo!
He died at only 23? He was so young
We lost a fellow gaming legend amongst our community.✊🏽And I swear not a second goes by when “what’s the 27 club? We ain’t making   It past 21” it’s harder and impacts me always. I’m 22yrs old and I don’t want to die young myself. And In the end it’s how you choose to spend your time in this one given Opportunity we call life. Stay blessed and prosper everyone
Technoblade was amazing to the gaming community. It’s so sad for him to leave us but We always be remembered in our hearts.
I wasnt a huge fan of him but this is really sad man😢 R.I.P Technoblade
He is the only god player better than b Dream for sure

This could make a grown man cry
Hi I’m Destiny and last month my boyfriend got me into watching DreamSMP All of it even the streams. What I notice about myself was that I’ll catch myself watching laughing more to Technoblade I remember telling my bf that technoblade is my favorite out of all them. Whenever I watch Techno and still do I always get this feeling like this is gonna be good and I’ll get excited just waiting for him to tell a story. Today I went to visit my bf to help babysit his Little niece what I saw on the screen I felt my heart drop I look at my boyfriend and I can tell he was crying and he’s not the type to cry but he did. As we’re watching the last video he uploaded I couldn’t help but cry cry cry cry bcuz I felt like I was to late that just last month I got into watching techno and now I’ll never get hear any more new stories from him. To see myself crying so hard so loud for someone I have never met just goes to show how much love and happiness he has given each and one of us. He is truly one of kind a legend that will never be forgotten and I’ll continue to watch his videos ⚔️👑⚔️💐💎💖
Goofy ahh 🚪👈
He was such a legend and so inspiring. It hurts so much when you hear about someone that you loved in your childhood and still love dies.

Bro was mid 💀💀💀
"Technoblade never dies" because he is a legend that will be in our memory's and hearts.He was an amazing minecraft YouTuber, he was always positive and could always crack a joke, the Minecraft community has lost a piece of greatness now that he is gone.He will be greatly missed.
He's up there plotting on how to fight and take over god. Just as he said. He's never dead, he's forever in our hearts 💚💚
i dont really know who this is but  rest in piece
He knew we wasn’t going to live, you can hear it in the jokes from the beginning.
R.I.P Technoblade. You will never be forgotten.
Rest In Peace Technoblade
R.I.P Techno you will be missed 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Never heard of him but rip young man
Im going to miss his humor , how in the beginning he joked about how he got nerfed cause he was too powerful. He never let it show even in the end, never let it get him down. I hope he was at peace. I had no idea how important his fandom was to him that in his last hours he'd choose to make a letter to us with that energy. I'll miss him. There's more I could say but I'll leave it at this. He took cancer down, he challenged the blood god and won. It's just that now he can't come back. All that's left is the legacy he left behind.
Rest In Peace, Techno 😞
Rip legend will be missed forever.
RIP Technoblade
He will never be forgotten
We will miss you technoblade
I was not an avid watcher of Technoblade, but I would watch a video occasionally. Got to love the fact that he titled his video "So Long Nerds". He created a truly amazing legacy!

Bro why  why he gotta leave so early can’t believe this bro
I am truly so sorry his family, friends and all his acquaintances. Age 23 is a kid, especially when your my age.  He kind, giving, loved, cherished and had a genuine sense of humor.  Bless his heart and soul.
the fact that he plugs his merch in the description... made me tear up thinking about the happy times and the memes... long live the blood god.
Technoblade shall rest in peace.
Many mourned for Technoblade. He can rest.
Rest In peace 👑🐷

Rip technoblade
im crying rn this hurts me so much its so hard to hold back away tear's. My big brother liked him a lot (not love love) and said he cried all night about this, But whoever reads my comment Rest in peace techno this is my first reaction of one of the most popular youtuber's die. ive had lost too but this hurts so much, the worst part is, i didnt even watch him. i didnt think he was cool and he wasnt for kids back at the time, i hope the smp. the other's. and more love him, Goodbye techno. We love you, i hope you have a great time in heaven
He WAS too young for this.
Wait so it's real
He is a Legend and will always be remembered!!! May the King Rest in Peice!!! 07 to Technoblade!!!
Never knew him but at 23 it's just a travesty. I work in pharmaceuticals for cancer treatments we're currently helping 8,000 patients so far it's not much in the grand scheme of things but how could he not get the treatment? It's a shame but he can now rest
Funny thing is that before his death, he had 10.4 mil subs. Now he has 11.4 mil subs. He gained a million with in a day and it shows how much people cared for him (I suppose).
When I found out about him passing away, I couldn’t stop crying.
Technoblade was truly an inspiring creator and will be missed and will never be forgotten and will always stay in our hearts - Legends never die
rest in peace Technoblade
Rest easy king 🐷👑
dam this made the news!!!!

R.I.P Technoblade
Technoblade RIP 🙏 🕊
TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES 🥲
o7. Rip technoblade
I've been listening to my son talk about technoblade since 2014. He had about 10,000 subscribers at the time. My son was 10 years old and he loved it. Over the years my son always spoke to me about him and it seems that I already knew him and really liked what he became. Yesterday when my son told me he had died I couldn't believe it. And when I saw the video of the father talking about him my heart broke. As a mother, I can't imagine the pain. But he in that short time of life left a wonderful legacy for all his followers. May God bless your family and take good care of our Technoblade.
Goodbye Technoblade, thank you for always being able to give me a laugh. ):
I don't know you but taking such preciousness of yours at a young age seem unfair.
It's sad. This will eventually happen to all the content creators we watched as kids.
Rip technoblade
Rest in peace legend❤️🙏
"TechnoBlade Never Dies" Rest Easy In Paradise
he was 23 he was still young but it doesn't matter now rest In  peace brother .👑

I'm going to miss him
Technoblade Never Dies. You will remain a legend, forever in our hearts.
I've heard of him for years but just recently started watching his content, just to now figuer out that he passed..
'Making june 30th techno day'
The blood-God's blood will remain in our blood! Technoblade never dies BABAAaaAAAEEeEEEE!!!!
To think you found out you had cancer when you're only 22 and eventually a year later you'd be dead. Life is unfair.
God bless him he is in a very beautiful place I send prayers for his family and loved ones and his viewers🙏💙
spent 6 hours crying. every time i see him or his videos I just start again. I'm not one to cry, not at all but this man was my childhood and i will always have techno on my mind when im playing minecraft or watching a simple video. When i get a dog they will be named Techno. When I get a child they will be named Alex. This peron was a huge inspiration on me and my friends. he was and IS hillarious. his voice is so iconic and funny and always made me laugh growing up. he is such a brave and strong human being and im proud to call myself a Mincraft player. Thank you Techno.
He was the best Minecraft YouTuber ever
RIP man get those diamonds in heaven 🙏
Moment of silence for Minecraft players
Who’s this random guy
Imma be honest he did show his face multiple times but never gave his legit name. We have a lot of irl pics and his play button unboxing which show his face
Rip
The worst news I could’ve received this year. This guy was a part of my adolescence.
👑👑👑
Technoblade never dies in our hearts 😭😭😔
my god if even inside edition is covering it you know it was a big deal
This is absolutely heartbreaking, rest in peace you minecraft legend
“Techno never dies”
R.I.P TechnoBlade we will miss you 🥲😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
ik we’re all grieving but the fact that technoblade planned and released a shirt saying “GG EZ Technoblade 1999-2022” beforehand is so out of pocket yet something so perfect coming from someone like him
Damn this caught me off guard, R.I.P Techno, you'll be forever remembered...
RIP 😢
Ever since this channel every got created. Its always the youtubers now who were the goats taken away. Its always every year to a month for real legends to get carried away from us. RIP ALL LEGENDS AND GET PREPARED WHO GOD WANTS NEXT! Btw i mean who god wants to take next - pls dont hate . - Techno Never Gets Left Out - I Repeat - Techno Never Gets Left Out!
I don't know why I keep clicking on these videos, I just start crying all over again. Rest in peace Alex, you will never leave our memories or our hearts.
Too young 😔.

The Minecraft community may have lost Technoblade, but will still be held up by quote.  *"Technoblade never dies!"*. May he rest in peace.
I just want to give his father a big hug. I feel so bad for him. I hope he and his mother will make it through this. Rest in peace Technoblade. You were a great person.
i miss him so much, fly high techno
I never watched you but rest in peace nerd. The only thing I know we had in common is minecraft and I hope you're up there minecrafting away. Maybe one day I'll join you in your game of minecraft.
Bro wtf I never watched him but holyshit rip
Yo ngl loved the guys comedic vibe although was never a "Fan" of him (by that i mean a subscriber who watched his videos regularly) i would bearly see some clips of him in shorts or complications, and i still remember the first video of him that i watched, which was non other than the iconic "beating minecraft with a steering wheel" i remember back then the video was kinda recent and dont quote me but i dont believe it was even that huge back then. Long story short im really upset of this news and hope the best for his family and may God have mercy on him
poor thing . . .
Rest In Peace techno may you be never forgotten
My hero ❤️🙌 😢
o7
Some quote I found on Twitter, "When you die of Cancer, Cancer dies with you. That's not a loss that's a draw."
Ain’t no wayyy
If you ever feel bad about technoblades death just remember he did so much in his life. He reached 10 million subscribers. Inspired millions of people and a lot of YouTubes would never be half the person with out him and his inspiration. R.i.p
R.I.P. 😔

You know, I never really connected with this guy, because I watched his videos a few times, but I just know that we never know when we die. Cancer at 23 is just sad
RIP TECHNO :(

R.I.P tbh I didn’t really like the dream smp but he did not deserve to die he was great funny person this legend will always will be remembered in the Minecraft community and will never be forgotten praying for his families
The legend will be missed 🐷👑
💔
It is surreal to see all these news outlets showing us Techno's picture when we think of his voice and his MC Skin. Even without seeing that we knew and were entertained by him. His mark on the Minecraft and YouTube community is profound and without words.
Rip
😥😪😥😪
He shouldn’t have died at 23, he had so much potential in him to be a great person on the internet. His career could have been amazing for him, but it was all gone in one fatal swoop. “Technoblade never dies” a term that we need true right now.
🐷👑😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Rest In Peace techno
Long live the blade
NOOOOOOO NOT TECHNOBLADE
And what makes it more upsetting is that 1.5 million people decide to subscribe to him after he died and only because  he was dead, where were they all when he was alive??? Ppl only care when it’s too late which is disappointing. He had 10.4 subscribers before the death
OMG IM SO FLABBERGASTED HE REALLY DIED WOW I REMEMBER WATCHING A VIDEO OF HIM SAYING IM DEAD AND I SAID HES JUST JOKING BRO RIP MUCH LOVE ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
All part of the master plan 😢
I feel bad for all yall but mostly because the crafting dude didnt fully get to live his life
man this sad..
o7 to technoblade, never ending blood for the blood god 😔
Technoblade never dies. He truly won’t as long as we’re here.
Even with his condition he still tried to make us happy. Technoblade will never die in our hearts ❤️🐷👑
🙁😢
rip technoblade
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😖
as soon as i saw this video i wanted to cry
I heard that if you died from cancer it will died as you died so it was a tie
🥺🥺
Man, I wonder what Techno would say about getting recognized on Inside Edition. I can't stop thinking about how he'd spin this into some kind of joke, or try to make light of this situation. RIP Techno.
Technoblade never dies in our hearts
Love Techno. He was a great youtuber. <3 ❤️❤️
:( atleast he got on inside edition, rest in peace techno
" Tevchnoblade never dies "
Rest in peace, Technoblade
Ah dammit man. Here it is. I was expecting inside edition to make a video on this. And also, he did show his face once in the past. But uh yeah… this is really shocking, and sad, and it’s hard to believe that this is really happening. Thank you for everything technoblade. Rest In Peace.
This is really sad though 😭😭😭
love u techno o7
R.I.P
I can't stop crying

Obviously Technoblade is a human and everyone has to die in some point of their life… it’s just unfortunate that he died due to cancer so young… He was my favorite Minecraft YouTuber and I’ve been watching him ever since 2015… I loved his videos so much and he always made my day when I watched his videos… Rip Technoblade… Technoblade never dies in our hearts ♥️
Did not expect to see my younger sibling Knocking on the bathroom door at 10:30pm, crying, telling me one of their favorite youtubers had died. We all thought there was more time. I’m praying for all of his fans and his family💕Edit: Merch has been ordered! How cute! So Gen Z of them!🥺💕🤣
Love yah NERRRDDDD
Have fun 1v1ing God in Heaven Techno. Rest in peace, king. Cancer dies when you die so let's call it a draw.

Technoblade was amazing and even though he has died, his memory will live on through his other hundred lives through the memories of happy times as both Alex, a son, friend, and brother, and as Technoblade, an inspiration and a friend through a screen.
I'm leaving this comment here so after a month or years when someone likes it, I get reminded of this masterpiece.
”Technoblade never dies"   cap.
Rest In Peace techno. You were the reason I survived Last year.
Omg
Rest in peace man, gone but not forgotten
WHAT!
"never dies"
NO
😞
Rest in peace Technoblade 🐷👑 Technoblade never dies in our hearts! ❤
“Technoblade never dies”
I feel like youtube needs a sort of Youtuber is dead Feature It basically marks final total subs but prevents any more subs as a sort of Memorial
It's clear inside edition doesn't actually care if they don't even know he did a face reveal SEVERAL years ago.
"Technoblade never dies"    Rest In Peace
NOOOOOOO
Rest in peace technoblade you will be in our hearts forever
rest in peace technoking

After crying for so many hours, this started it all over again. It hurts a lot, because many of us have been here for so many years watching him, we got to know him through his videos. He understood us, and we have been here for so long that it feels like I lost a member of my family. Rest in peace Techno, we all love you   Once again, Technoblade never dies.

Rest In Peace Techno Blade. No more pain your with God now
TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIESSSSSSSSSSSSSSs!
No why techno man
Rest In Peace technoblade I acually want to cry of the profile picture of the video r.I.p 😣🥺
At least he was able to use that phrase that every kid would like to use someday: if you're watching this it's because I'm dead
can we cure cancer already
Bro made 1 million in his death
No one deserves to be taken at such an age, let alone after doing so much good. I can't say I know what his family is going through, but I can say they have my and all of our support. His influence on people and on his collogues will always remain, and his followers will remember him forever. He left his mark on the world, and Technoblade never dies. Rest in peace, Alex.
Techno said to the cancer "if I'm going, I'm taking you with me"   My condolences to his family and friends...
Rest in peace, Alex. You impacted so many people, even ones like me who rarely watched your content. Fly high 💗

When a youtuber died and Inside Edition picks it up and posts a news segment, you know that youtuber was important.
TechnoBlade still lives in our heart
😭😭😭😭😭
"a popular Minecraft YouTuber"  Bruh he was the best Minecraft player ever
I feel for his father. My own family just lost my nephew, Jake, to cancer this past month. He was an Air Force crew chief, a bike shop mechanic, and loved to go MTB riding. He was 3 days away from his 29th birthday when he passed.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Rest In Peace Technoblade 😔. You will always be in our hearts 💕🕊🙏

To be fair, he has shown his face before. Several times actually
I never knew about him, and it's truly a shame that he had to deal with such an illness. I hope that his friends and family will find some peace knowing that someone who gives to the community is never really gone. Much love to all the folks who knew him and were fans of his channel, I wish you all the best and I hope good things come your way soon <3
Rip techo

I discovered Techoblade 2 years ago probably around 6 million subs  RIP Legend Techoblade never dies! 🕊️
wait what
Minecraft legend Rest In Peace
rest in peace man ❤️
This person was the same age as me and e managed to get over 11 million subscribers. He may no longer be with us and I personally didn't watch his videos but there is no doubt in my mind that what he accomplished in that short amount of time is probably more than what an overwhelming majority of people including myself which they could accomplish.
RIP Technoblade I really loved how he was friendly kind and hopeful Rest In Peace Technoblade 😭😞💔
His legacy will never die
May god be peace upon him
RIP Techno 🪦
We'll never forget him <3
omg rip i was watching him yesterday and was like hope he never dies but then the time came now rip you will be missed💔🙁
Techno was really important to me... I'm crying it hurts so much that he died .... Fly high King:(

Rip
They took him too soon
Rip :(
😿
Some minor corrections. Techno had 10.3-5 million before passing I forget exactly. Also he had shown his face after he beat the game with a steering wheel.
Ah yes thank you for spreading the news we all miss him! :( long live the king of minecraft 🥇
🕊️
i didn’t even know who he was but when his dad started reading the notes i started to cry . rip alex
He was amazing, may he Rest In Peace.
He is in a better place now 😩🥺😭😭😭😭😭
Technoblade Never Dies
Rest in peace 🕊️ technoblade
I haven’t watched him in years, then I heard this and thought it was fake… wow. I couldn’t believe this was real. Last time I watched him was around when COVID started, maybe even a little before it started. I quit playing Minecraft, but still watched him alongside 2 others who played. He was an inspiration to many and brightened others days. May he Rest In Peace.

When you die to cancer, Cancer dies too. Techno didnt lose, it was a draw. Technoblade never loses, and Technoblade never dies.   Long live the blood God.
This hits me especially hard, he's probably the only person I've watched consistently throughout my childhood, I spent my life growing up with Technoblade and I even got to meet him once, may he rest in peace
His sub count jumped post mortem.
Whomever read this I pray that everyone is having abundant health in the Lord Jesus Christ name amen!!!!
Legends never die  -XXX
Techno didn’t lose because cancer died with him so it is a draw
R.I.P I fell so bad for his family.
This is rude, so many YouTubers have died but haven’t been put of inside editon? That’s messed up.
I didn’t really watch Technoblade but it’s sad to know how someone’s hero could pass away like that. He’ll still hold the heart of many gamers regardless of where he is.
what...
I pray that everyone is having a blessed day and night so far in the Lord Jesus Christ name amen!!!!
w inside edition
R.I.P
You guys better be giving the money to a charity instead of just talking about a dead person and making money off of it
Techno never dies his cancer does

rest in peace Technoblade:(
Sad
R.I.P
I never knew about this  Pretty sad
W
Dude the amount of bots who replied to peoples comment’s taunting Technoblade is WAY TOO MUCH. He died from cancer at 23 and saying he deserved it is going too far. He is one of the most well-known creators on YouTube, and bots replying to peoples messages, some hating on Technoblade and “celebrating” (theres not many words to describe it) his death is so disrespectful, especially when bots reply to messages MOURNING and GRIEVING over Technoblades death. Now I don’t know much about bots, but whoever created them please stop. Cancer is a horrible thing that, throughout my short life, I have seen *many* people suffer from. Digitally, real life… its sad. It’s such a common disease that kills so many people. Even different cancers, ones that aren’t as bad as other types, make peoples lives miserable. It can cause bad depression, too. People with cancer have to take strong drugs (chemotherapy) to fight off the cancer which can take months (or even years) on end. Even after the cancers gone, all that stuff you have to take is super unhealthy for you, so cancer or not, your in bad condition. So why don’t you bots and bot creators shut the hell up, it’s offensive to A LOT of people. And yes I know about this because one of my family members had cancer once.
Alex may have died but technoblade never will...
Rest in peace🙏🏻🥺🕊
Technoblade did show his face...??
blood for the blood god
Fly high king
Technoblade never dies rip we’re always losing Legends
let god not hesitate, and send techno straight to heaven. We missed you. we miss you. we will miss you. I am happy to be a nerd or yours. I have been watching him since 2017. Goodbye, Blood God
To be honest I don’t think he’s dead and k think he’s just gonna say “Technoblade never diesssss”
"When someone dies from cancer, the cancer dies too" its a draw .. technoblade never loses ❤❤❤
I don’t wanna cry but techno Rest In Peace you were an actual legend now please take on the kingdom of god

My bestest friend Mad was a fan of TechnoBlade. He was so sad when he heard that TechnoBlade oofed and he told me nothing could cheer him up. :( Rest In Peace Techoblade. I never knew you but Mad did. :( Edit: Mad is now happy but I still think deep down, he's still sad about his favorite YTer being gone.
0:21💔
Thank you technoblade. 😭 Rest In Peace.
Damn, that is sad, man
NOT EVEN CLOSE BABY! TECHNO NEVER DIES!
"Technoblades never dies" 😔 rest on piece 👑
Some people say that techonoblade lost to cancer, but when people die all cells in his/her body also dies, including the cancer cells, so technically it's a draw   TECHNOBLADE NEVE DIES....
He knew he would die and made joke about it it takes balls to be that positive
I knew this would come   RIP Technoblade 🫡
That's that's n-
Wow....Techno. I love you. Rest in Peace.

RIP Forever TechnoBlade
No
I’ve never heard of technoblade but this was very sad and I see that he had a good fan base. RIP
No
"Technoblade never dies!" Rest in peace, you legend.
I wasn’t too familiar with technoblade, but I am still very sad. The shock is definitely worse than the feelings as I seriously can’t believe this. His name just doesn’t feel right in that title.
R.I.P Technoblade no more Mr Beast colabs
Thank You for Everything Techno
He did so much for so many people in his shirt 23 years, Rest In Peace technoblade, may you live forever in our hearts
Pin This：“When you die from cancer, the cancer dies too. That’s not a loss that’s a draw, technoblade never loses” copy and paste
Thank you For listing to my wishes now we all know
As soon as I stopped crying
I found out he died from a MLP chat room game, there was just a section of the map were ponies dressed as technoblade. I asked "Why is there so many technoblade?" And someone replied "He passed away" "he lost the battle". I then realized how many ponies were crying. I'll be honest, not the best way to find out about his passing :/.
😭"technobaled never dies" but to day he died🥺😢
Lmaoo
*"Technoblade never dies"*
Weres the Kris’s😶‍🌫️😥
rip
Techno will forever live in our memories . Rip King ❤️🐷
Technoblade never dies
rest in piece Alex
It’s crazy how many people were impacted and just how wide the news about it spread. Also Technoblade’s channel gained over a million subscribers under a day during this time and I expect it to still keep rising as the news spread.
T-T
Dang.... He shouldn't died like this it won't be real
I may have never watched him but TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES my God let him in those pearly gates
Technoblade never dies goodbye legend.
my son told me about this & i said "oh that's people probably making it up " damn i got his hopes up for nothing
legends never die as long as they're not forgotten.
Tehnoblade never dies 👑🐷🥀
Ugh… feels like a punch in the Gut man Rest in Peace Brother Your Humor and Specially YOU will be very much missed.
"Technoblade Never Dies", Rest in Piece Techno.
Look at my profile pic. Yeah, extremely sad. He will go to God with the crown still on his head 👑, rest easy  1999-2022
Long live the blade.
NOOOO
Technoblade Never Dies, Never Dies In Our Hearts ♥️
Maaaan they put Ads on this
He is not dead, he is still here in heart.
.
This is so incredibly sad. Technoblade was an incredible soul and will be missed. We all will live in his memory and remember him forever. Rest In Peace king
it's crazy how he acted in videos while he had this going on. I truly believed he had already beaten it--always so positive and acted as if there was nothing wrong. It's even more insane how he kept his humor even in death especially with a video titled "So long nerds" such a powerful human.
Legends never die
“TechnoBlade Never Dies” !😔🤧he will never be forgotten… :( ♥️🕊
🖤
Oh no
Dear Lord, my most sincere condolences to his family and friends. He seemed to be a person that brought light to the world, but that light will remain in the hearts of everyone who knew him or watched his videos.   A bit selfish to admit maybe, but it hits hard in part because I'm younger than him by a year...
Rip techno
"Technoblade never dies" and he never will in our hearts
The legend dies but will never die in our hearts rest in peace
Technobade never dies :(:(
rip Technoblade 😭😭😭😭😭😢❤️❤️💙
I don't really like Minecraft YouTubers for their cringe but rip Technoblade and my condolences go out to his family♥️
Whos that
RIP Technoblade why do good people die so young.
No fuxking way
i know so sad :(
PEOPLE SAYS DREAM'S BETTER|WHEN TECHNO DIED NOW HIS THE LEGEND
Wow, that's sad :(
Techno blade never dies
Rip
Techonblade us on our harts forever rest in peace
Rest in piece king. 👑
Him writing the message for us, his fans, only hours before his death really shows how much he cared for us and how finding the right words to help the audience really feel how much he cared for them shows how great of a person he is and even though he didn’t know the 11.5 million people who watched him  personally, he still thought of us even though he was only a few steps away from the gateway to heaven.  He will be missed and I will mark this day in my calendar as the day a legend who never dies and never will die even though he isn’t on this plane of existence, moved on to a new life.  Fly high king
:(
Noooo
TECHNO NEVER DIES ❤️
Dream smp
R.i.p he is playing sky block in real life now 😞😭
My favorite Technoblade quotes in light of his tragic passing. "Officer I dropped kicked that child in self defense" "Technoblade never dies" "Did someone say rebellion"  "I'm the Second-Worst Thing to Ever Happen to Those Orphans". Whats the first worse thing to happen to those orphans Quackity asks. "Quackity they weren't always orphans."
Never heard of him because I’m old and not into that but I can tell you how bad I feel for him and his family. 😢. He certainly had a good outlook and attitude. REST IN PEACE dear boy.
Sad
Damn pass away the age of 23, about two years longer then me. It was too early and too young for him to passed away like that. One of the few best players I looked up too and had inspired me not just to play Minecraft but other games.  Farewell technoblade, it's been along run.  "Technoblade never dies" ✌️🐷👑

Technoblade never dies though.. 🥹
Omg- I was just watching tiktok and I thought it was fake but this😭😭😭😭 RIP
Technos face was never a secret? He literally made cooking videos and other real life stuff ?
Techoblade was a light to the world. He was funny and loving. He died to young at 22. He has traversed this world so much. He deserves to rest well.
And they deleted my comment. It’s okay. I’ll take it to the subs
He is conquering the Kingdom of God now 🥹
:(
I don’t care how much my family doesn’t get it. I am broken. I will be crying for days maybe weeks bc he really cheer me up with his videos.
My heart broke after hearing about technoblade but at least we have some videos
RIP to a real one 🙏
Its gut wrenching. Goodbye and thank you, blood god.
Alex may have died, but technoblade never will
NO
Rip Alex, you will always been remembered and loved
;(
Fun fact: he got to 11.6 million when his family posted the video, it proofs that he will still live in our hearts no matter what!
WHAT
Rest In Peace Technoblade 🙏 he was beloved to YouTube in general and I’m sure he will inspire thousands of people
Sad

The technoblade, the one with the amazing sassy voice, the man we knew and watched. The Minecraft Mondays to MCC he was great. You could easily forget he has cancer because of how much he stayed the same. You'd never thi nk bed die. THE REAL technoblade has been taken from us.  He will go beat God in heaven as the last government. We love him and he Wil not ever die in our hearts.
I have to be honest I never really did watch techno blade but it is kind of sad that he’s gone r.I.p
It really breaks me to see sad news about techno. Its just shocking... and sad.  RIP King

Although I never watched his videos. He seemed like a great guy. Farewell Technoblade, Until we meet again. One thing I may as well mention is that when he announced his cancer diagnosis, there were a lot of people who used it for clout and started hate channels. I hope that dosent happen again, for him, or anyone.
NOO OH MY GOD, I REMEBER ALWAYS WATCHING HIM...  he will always have a place in our hearts rip technoblade 🙁

Thank you for covering this

did not expect him to look like that bye
I was never a technoblade fan, but i knew about him and i knew all the great things he has done for people everywhere. rest in piece
Technoblade never dies
Techno never dies
Bro wtfffffffff
It's really 😭 that people were fans of Alex were given the news that he died from cancer. If I was ever diagnosed with cancer or something else, when my end of life is nearing then I'll leave a letter to my sister and then she can share the news to my fans. This is unlikely to happen to me because I don't want to die in a young age. I'll do my part and take care of myself when I am a grown man. I kinda want to know how did Alex get Cancer in a young age? I will be revealing something that I have been hiding from my followers on Instagram and probably share it on YouTube and also telling what's my real name because I just leave this ***** Flores on my Instagram story. I didn't say a bad word if you see that before the word Flores.
Rest in Peace
We will always remeber u technoblade
R. I. P :( sadness
Technoblade never died, Alex did
Rip Techno
I don't watch him, or really know him either, but I still got teary-eyed after finding out about this. He seemed like such a funny, cool, caring guy. RIP
