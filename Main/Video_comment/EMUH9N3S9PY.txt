The greatest comeback story ever? 💪
Jesus loves lives  boy ‘💙
10/10
Usyk usyk usyk usyk etc etc
Tyson said he fought everyone in thier prime 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
aged well...
7:20 hasn't aged well.
🎉❤🎉🎉
Wow, think that might be the best overlap ever, and that's a big statement. Well done Gary and all the team pulling this off. Plus a massive thank you to Fury 🙌🏼🙌🏼
34:05 Tyson is right i remember watching this interview when it dropped and it has been 3 years
Tyson fury is full time dad and half time boxer quarter time a punter
This world needs this man - absolute legend … beautiful interview 👏❤️‍🔥
Who’s here at the first new year in May
aha gary said what you were 29st, 28 corects lol
What a guy. Smashed ir Gary
Very honest ❤️
Gotta respect the comeback but Fury does polish the truth 😂 he fought Klitschko 18months before Joshua did but talks like it was years before with Wlad in his absolute prime. He’s always on Socials giving it the chat about AJ & Hearn but says Joshua’s in his DMs 😂  Just wish they’d both fight so it can all be put to bed, a great British boxing fight for the ages.
Brilliant, simply as that
G k
So fighting Francis isn't about money 😂😂 you muppet.
When tyson was, some what, humble
Wilder is NOT  the most feared knock out artist in the history of boxing.
Why you cut out bit about Joshua drinking an orange juice tensing his muscles on the dance floor???
Great role model for the upcoming generation..
Love these two legends!!
There's is literally suppose be a whole foot in difference in their height. Doesn't look it, Gary looks tall, good camera work if you ask me .
Stop lying Luke ya  🤡
Total Bullshit
the ending was so beautiful this is why i hate feminism tyson fury the hardest man alive but he still needed his lady to look after him just like us all when our mothers leave this earth we need a lady/angel to look after us
Remember anxiety attack myself so true couldn't breath thought I'm dead , so scarry
Tyson fury what a hard working clever man and a deep thinker .
Came in with no expectations and anticipating that I'd roll my eyes all the way through. Left smiling and thinking, "what a guy".
🔥
Best show gaz brilliant stuff
LOVE YOU TYSON - A REAL HUMAN BEEING!!!!!
Big fan of Greedy belly !  But bigger fan of Wladimir..... the legend.... Klitschko.. 🥊🥊🥊
30:00 this is how i feel rn
You wunt think some one who suffers from depression who can be so confident couse depression as drained me
Tyson is a captivating character.
Now he's running from a Cossack... Smdh
I'm watching this in February 2023 and AJ is getting ready to fight Franklin. I literally beleived In what AJ was trying to achieve and he's just come out saying he looks at fighting like a business and thats it. I was taken back by his comments, didn't expect them. Now I'm watching this interview at a year old and Tyson is saying AJ is only in it for business. I got suckered big time. Respect Tyson. 👍
Honest interview like that he gave his respect to wilder about being a great puncher obviously he’s the champ so can’t give to much credit but a real interview we’ll done
WOW, Fury was to me an anti hero, but a few interviews in, he's a fucking king! What a nice guy, I'll be rooting for you!
A true inspiration from a man with character.
Hes 1 amazing human. Great sence of humor and down to earth man.
*TYSON FURY IS THE OWNER OF AN ILLEGAL PUPPY FARM*
he 100% wasnt drinking on his own - seen him go through basically every bar on deansgate locks with his brothers on a rampage drinking about 30 bottles of ciroc. Shane was 100% there and didn't tell him to stop or slow down once
One of my favorite athletes and people. How can you not like or pull for a man like Fury who's overcome the things he has? Always very real, engaging, and entertaining.
I like Tyson so much he so dw to earth he my new  crush
He looks lean and mean
The yellow tarmac all along the front ….. me and my gang did that 👌🏻👌🏻 multipaves tarmac legends! There’s only oneeeeeee Tyson furyyyyy
Awesomeness 💯
Ruiz Ruiz Ruiz and say Goodnight mate.
Only someone with money doesn't worry about money
Wow, that was awesome, Gary. And what a generous gift!  Tyson was so open and honest. Great bloke with a great big heart.
Thanks Gary and Tyson!
AJ is a real boxer,despite his very short amateur career, he is always fighting the best. Unlike Wilder and Fury,they do their best to avoid top ranked heavyweights for the past 14 years but they will always come to the media to tell lies. Both Fury and Wilder 14 years boxing career, they don't have any title unification fight. They do their best to avoid champions and top ranked heavyweights. AJ has fought about 5 title unification fights. That is fighting champions from other organization. AJ even fought Usyk,undisputed crucial weight champion.
The deceitful social media champion and his team never wanted the fight.Just wanted to use AJ's name to shine....build his fake resume. That's how Wilder and Fury deceived their fans to make them feel they are good. 14 years boxing career,that's what they do. Now he wants to fight 2 unranked boxers or Chisora he had already beaten twice. Fury is real joke to the heavyweight division.
Even a non boxing person could see Joshua is not even on the same level as a boxer/ fighter. Joshua is a boring nothing special muscle head. Fury has speed, moves, power , durability and a mind for the science. A complete package in a large body. He’s a larger, harder hitting version of Muhammad Ali.
How can you not like this guy? He’s just totally straight forward! A regular guy who’s done well. God bless him!!
Got the image of aj being knocked spRk out by Deonty 🙃
what best men in there prime have you fought
"I'm just the same old G, drinking me coffee in Morecambe"
I used to dislike you.   You were my least fave boxer.   My option don’t mean much but I love you now mate.  You’re an inspiration.
Tyson Fury 'I don't need money to be happy'....comes out of retirement again and negotiates a multi million dollar contract when he is already a multimillionaire.....what was he saying about his friends always chasing more money? what a hypocrite.
I come back and watch this every few months and it makes me so emotional. I hope tyson fury forms his own mental health organisation when he retires. This man is such an inspiration
After watching this interview, I got so much respect for the great Tyson Fury 💯
And 2 this day the racist fraud aj still scared,  love gypsy king,
The anxiety conversation I fully relate love this man what a legend 🤙
I have watched this interview 3 times, When I am a bit down , I will run this to cheer myself up,I find him extraordinary, my admiration for Tyson Fury grows every time i watch it, he is an inspiration.
#HarryMaguire out
I've suffered with mental illness for as far as I can remember and I love this guy's openness and his ability to be open because I was embarrassed about it and became brilliant at hiding it so big up Tyson for bringing it into the light , peace brother 🙏
Your hammer Joshua mate he's got a glass chin you've proven you've got a chin of granite mate
Tyson fury the 👑 of 🥊
Yes Tyson: happy wife happy life.
“What a frigging legend” Ben Foster😂😂naw seriously, absolute gent and not your typical gent either which shows his class as a man😎
Lol tyson is turning into his father
One of the best overlap episodes this one, love Tyson as a fighter but he comes across as a very likeable person and a personality too
Some guy totally proud of him
Legends
There needs to be an independent regulator for Boxing.
Tyson is such a fascinating guy and defo one of my fav boxers 🤜 I love listening to him speak about others, straight to the point and funny. Great questions Gaz! 👌
Great interview between Tyson & Gary 👏🏼
Knacker fought nobody lazy tosser fu
who are the best guys in prime that he beat
"It's not about the money" that didn't age well!!!! Now he's saying he "won't fight for less the than half a billion" 🤮😂🤣
Greatness
Legend
Brilliant Gary. 😉
I wish AJ and Fury would have a domestic dust up, belts or no belts. The stadium would sell out, as would the PPV so the money would be there. For all boxing fans, It would be awesome to see.
That was brilliant, be honest I was a doubter, but the guy is brilliant. Totally real no BS, loved watching the wilder fights, and good luck in his retirement. Smashed it!!!
usyk und Joshua stand no chance against usyk
fury is by far the best. will kill everybody
Tyson is a hell of human being. He walked past the other day in morcambe just chilling
Absolute gold. Keano is still f****** magic! And Nev's not bad.
Tyson Fury is indeed a real man.
Absolutely the greatest British sporting hero of the last 25 years. TF 🥊
The best interview with Tyson Fury, that I have seen. Relaxed, open, happy. Well done, Gary. Great job.
OMG... I have seen 1000s of videos . This one is the Best. Inspirational. Upfront. Real Life
Tyson is a real champ, he has champions mentality.
I have been AJ and Tyson Fury fan for like forever but if AJ and TF fight I will support TF
Woudln't it be great if boxing was just like a premier league, each boxer has to fight each other. Obviously yeah don't go back to days when fighters used to fight 10/20/30 fights a year. But if the there was just one ranking division, unified, best of the best, the top fight the top.  But, humans lol
love it
Nice shoes Tyson 😅
Got to be one of my favorite interviews, really honest, no bull shit, really motivating
8:08, I don’t care about biz, what’s the energy drink called?
Love the Tyson. Double hard bastard - but also compassionate and honest!  Great interview!
That’s some gift. Nev parting with his own print of the dream team. FairPlay
How real Tyson Fury is, is an amazing open and fresh to see. For him to open up and say how he felt and wanting to die. I think what he's done is one of the best things is the world of sport. Love or hate him you have to respect him!!
Love him or hate him, you can't deny Tyson Fury has natural charisma.
Please can we have Tyson as the leader of England ,and get rid of all those boarding school bed wetters in the building with the giant clock .
Love his slippers 🥿
Who’s going to tell him his shoes are shockers?
Tyson fury is such an amazing person, I have huge huge respect for him
Brilliant this is, well done Gary and sky 👏
if you saw this man ungainly walking down the street, you wouldn't think he'd be able to run up a flight of stairs
lovely present amazing!!!!
wat an amazing man and not because he can fight, but to explain so many blokes inner fight thx Tyson
He's going to go back on his words and cone out of his self imposed retirement
Didn't you bought an old man in Vladimir
Lying his ass of about money .and you mugs are drinking up  this lying bs
What a gent, and what a life,  it sounds to me like he had some kind of divine intervention when he said it felt like he had the weight of the world on his shoulders and it was suddenly lifted, and he got straight back into training
AJ would not win the fight against Tyson Fury.
Tyson’s got Gary’s accent coming out so much thicker, not an H in sight with these 2
6:04 Gary stood like an action figure, he has no clue what to do with his hands
<3
brilliant interview! Fury Funny honest humble & A Diamond.
from 21:30  that spiel had me in tears. you're not just a legend to me for being a beast in the ring. but also being a beast in life. love you fury. you saved me and my family.
Those shoes ,Morecambe, fuck off  lol
classic interview
i hope tyson can face his childhood trauma cant have been easy ....
The Gypsy King👑
I love Tyson Fury, he's definitely made it ok for men to be unhappy, and depressed. I hated being told to man up and face the world as a man!! Brilliant spokes person, all the best Tyson and all you men out there speak up!!!
Best YouTube channel by a country mile. Just brilliant.
Ol Tyson looks clean, fresh and fit now...good for him.
Tyson says if he drinking he needs someone around to control him lol but who gonna do that lol 😆 😂 🤔 🥊
Really incredible interview, it gives such a picture of the depths of mental health struggles. In many ways Fury is lucky as he has a supreme gift and talent which has enabled him to drag himself out of the misery. For mere mortals, the struggle must be absolutely indescribable.
Gary neville having a conversation with the man tyson fury . Know your lady will leave you will set you free. Times have changed so much. The girls just wanna shag everything. Gary neville
I can't believe how thin his legs are
This is an amazing interview Fury!
A real genuine honest lovely fella .. Tyson Fury opens his heart & troubles an outstanding Boxer 🥊 the best of his generation and some !!  a real Sports personality..  and extremely likeable fella 👍 good on yer big man - Good Health - what we do in life echoes in eternity is certainly true for you Sir 👊😃 a fine interview mr Neville 👌
My favorite Tyson Fury video is when he explains his reasons for change: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6o4GEJahn0
My favourite Tyson Fury video is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6o4GEJahn0
Love this man. All his problems are very relatable and he is indeed very inspriring! Brilliant individual!!
Great Irishman ..
Gary Neville   Sod management  Top talk show host, superb fella, now watched two this one and Kean.
I saw your ufr Roy Keanne one also......nice one
Absolutely brilliant interview--the whole bit!
Just got to love the guy really
Gary was nervous because he wasn’t that good. He was consistent
that was a superb interview
Fury the philosopher
sounds like a gentleman and scholar.
Lying Gypsy thief.  A Gypsy will do whatever it takes to get what he wants. And he certainly did that during 3 fights. Unbelievable. But when you have the commission and the WS system as a whole behind you then there is nothing to fear. Another lie to mold history in favor of a bum.
His honesty is intoxicating, he keeps real on everything! I really admire this man.
I loved the interview, love Tyson Fury, he is a great guy! He is the nicest boxer ever.
Tyson is magic he’s a great person well done big man God Bless
Gary Neville is brilliant he does his interviews spot-on well done Gary 👏
So Eddie knew it, Josh knew it that you will be fighting wilder but you don’t know , and you make the public believe the fight is gonna happen? 😳😳😳😳. Liar n contradiction in chief.
Amazing God fearing man. God bless Tyson Fury!
Big Man ,The happiness you seek is in that Book your Uncle gave you. That was the best gift you could have ever got. Enjoyed your being open and honest in this interview.
You guys can retire
Come back later in life against Lewis
Tyson there is someone out there to knock your head of rap it up one more fight big bucks finish
Just want to be happy.!!!! Seems simple.This interview has completely changed my perception of this man. Respect Tyson fury
33:30 Are you listening McGregor?
I can relate a lot to what Tyson said about his mental health issues, I have felt exactly the same and unless you have experienced it you can't understand it. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. This was a great interview.
Rocky Balboa had the best comeback story by far!
Brilliant interview Gary , what a fella and god bless Paris for sticking with her man ..she’s a star to bring Tyson back from the brink
Tyson is a leading light in the world we live in.....his honesty is so refreshing for those who suffer with mental illness.... He can inspire those who have mental illness to go on and lead a better life....
Tyson Fury is a destined LEGEND
I Respect Fury is the Champ 👑🥊💪😁 but I Respect Anthony Joshua
Bit of a legend is Tyson. What a normal good guy.
I love Tyson, and am also Irish, but with this bald haircut he reminds me of Dana White's big brother.
I think AJ’s team is stalling to wait for the GK to be slow and on his way out  16:42
Shen i was younger I thought neville was an absolute wanker as a player. How things change as you age. Now i respect him as a player and as a commentator and media personality, seems like a top bloke
Such an inspiration for us that are suffering Tyson.
How can fury say AJ hasn’t fought 1 top heavyweight in his prime when Fury’s C.v is piss awful, ya only fought 1 actual boxer and that was klitschko b4 anyone says it do me a favour with wilder cos he ain’t no boxer.   Mans only trying to convince himself
he is pretty impressive.
Only one Tyson....Mike.
18:08 that's what you came for
You can listen to these two all day. Completely open and honest its great
Absolute Class!
Go on Tyson the best In the northwest he is the best go Tyson ✅🙏♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
All gypsy have anxiety attacks
love him.Stick to lynx adverts josh
I enjoyed that! Thumbs up!
Besides his incredible knack for boxing, he also has incredible skills in speaking.
Take my hat off to you tyson! the happiness part of the interview really hit a nerve. Hope you find happiness in whatever you do sir!
Every word is a lie
Fury : money means nothing to me i dont care   Fury : whyte needs to accept 80 20
Fury : i never cheat on diet during camp  Fury : i had 4 beers before first wilder fight
Great interview
This guy is really tough imagine he managed to beat deontay welder who is the current heaviest puncher in world heavyweight championship.
good to see Tyson in another mode besides the angry one
What a brilliant honest down to  earth guy Tyson is, not forgetting he’s the greatest heavyweight boxer in the world, superb interview.....
Love this guy propper northerner, no fucking about truth down the line
You Brits have more than a national treasure in Tyson Fury,  the world loves this man!!!!
happy wife happy life Tyson
34:01"I'm almost obsessed with time" - love his philosophy!
If your uncle lives there it ain’t neutral……….just saying 🥊
I live in Morecambe that man is a legend what you see is what you get
Fury or Neville for priminister !!
tyson as batman would be cool
My god this is a leader of men, the leader of men we need right now! What a fucking champion.
Superb interview. Kudos to Neville. Never  heard Tyson open up like he did here.
He's a GREAT role model!
Gary Neville walking like he's got two rolls of carpet under his arms
When their in the cafe at the end and Tyson says I just want to be happy 🥺
Every time i feel like blowing my brains out i look up the the god gypsie king. Insperational man. Wonderfull amazing man family man. Ridiculous courage and strenth hes shown. Was at his 1st fight in Nottingham. Would love to meet him. Even thought off booking a weekend in morcome trying to meet him but think that would come across weird and obsessive. Thank you tyson for saving my life. Keeping me here in this world. Keeping me here to be a strong dad and individual xxxxxx god bless xxxxxxxx
I love the truth you speak Tyson!
The issue everyone skirts around is why did they sign a contract with a rematch clause. Fury was a mandated challenger by the WBC, what possessed them to sign on for a third? Besides money  Still, this guy is already a HOFer, let's enjoy him while we can!
Who's here after Fury smashed Wilder in the trilogy?
Second best after Roy Keane's interview. Amazing one Fury and Gary. Try to bring Keane and Tyson in one room.
And then there was Usyk.
What a great and inspiring human being!
An eye opener for me..I used to think Tyson was just a big bear...now I realise what a likable open hearted person he is, nice guy.
Legend also Gary u cool used to think u was a knob ha ha 😂
I hope you can enjoy a good retirement when it comes round and many thanks both of you enjoyed listening
Good watch 👍🏻💪🏻
Fury am happy you have an inner peace!!! which  you have found through JESUS!!! its always good to testify it, to encourage others  to try!
Big respect to Fury and Neville. Two humble, honest blokes in their own right.
When i was a kid my mum used to say you don't know what depressed is never say that to your kids
What a bloke Tyson is.
Loving Tysons 1s and 2s.   Wish he would knock Neville out!!
Fury would fucking murder Joshua.
Brilliant interview, love Tyson
The talk about money & happiness, jesus that's so relevant mate ! Should be a lesson to everyone, never chase money like them millionaire & billionaires, just chase a stable & good situation & true happiness. Once you have a good enough situation why chase more? Just develop all the other aspects of your life having that nice situation & you'll live a happy life
Brilliant from both men , like the Roy Keane one I wish it had gone on for hours . So relaxed and honest . Egos and bravado non-existent  . Like 2 blokes in the pub having a chat almost .   Very honest and enjoyable . Bravo .
Those shoes are ridiculous lol... amazing bloke though, have to respect him for the way he came back from depression to world champ
Beaten by a overweight Mexican then beaten by a Ukrainian midget 🤣🤣☺️☺️ and all the Joshua fanboys actually think he can beat fury jahahahahahajahahahahhahahhahahaha
What an honest fella ! No bullshit , really enjoyed this interview.
Never in a million years did i as a Scouser think i would enjoy anything Gary Neville did, but got to admit i love his style of interviewing and the questions he asks without kissing a**e, brilliant idea this.
As a schizophrenic nobody knows more about waking up and wanting to kill yourself than i do. It's everyday for the last 8 years but my daughter would miss me too much. If she wasn't here then neither would i be.
GOD IS GOOD
Great interview, really showed the humanity of the man. His words about his depression almost brought a tear to my eye. Thanks Gary and thank you Mr Fury :) All the best for the future, 1 day at a time.
He beat  an old  and Mentally beat past it  Klitschko. An  Klit wernt in his prime  then.  Retired.  Didn't fight 95%. Of the top rated fighters of his time   came back beat wilder. Who's beat No1   only prime fighter. Fury's beat. Is. Chisora. And that's coming off a loss lol.   No your history
I love this guy the best heavyweight boxer in this generation he's the new rocky marciano today!
Tyson Fury is such a level headed guy. He's so honest about what he went through and is a brilliant spokesman for the mental health and substance abuse. Here is THE REDEMPTION STORY. He took himself to the top of the world beating Klitschko Dr Steelhammer then suffered so badly but didn't fold but came back and ruled the world and gave us the best 3 fight series the world has seen. Joshua wouldn't fight Wilder but Tyson...............
Wilder is the most telegraphing fighter I have ever seen, even a novice can see it as it's cocked back all the time as he stalks you to try and land it, along with that he has a jab upstairs and tries harder with it downstairs, other than that is just the lucky pub puncher with a good side on stance but it's pretty static and a man like Tyson Fury he ain't gonna cope with.
Top top top interview. Never heard a more truthful guy than Fury, so many people out there would never talk about the stuff he does.
Such a nice bloke fury .
that's why people love him...he never cowards back onto himself when asked about the lows and the bad things like most celebrities or sportspeople, that never have the guts to speak about their low moments or bad times...tyson revels in them and uses those bad moments to grow and empower himself...what a legend! really hope he could  wipe the smile out of AJ's face...
Tyson what a man so honest.........................................
What a brilliant interview, a lot of respect to Tyson.
That is one of the best interviews I've ever seen
Love Tyson but ffs those shows ...really
Nothing but respect for Fury after watching this.To speak so candidly and openly about his struggles knowing millions of people will see it. Well done lad
Brilliant interview
Absolutely love this guy (Fury)
Is Gary wearing platforms in his shoes? Sometimes Tyson looks more 6'5 than 6'9
Humble, and no doubt in my mind the greatest heavy weight I the world, past and present. My reason for that because he has never been beaten, and he vacated his belts, went into depression, & came back to become champion again.
Has there ever been a more open and honest champion both inside and outside the ring? Legend
Tyson says that boxing is the only job he would ever be good at . Not true , in my opinion . When you listen to his story it is impossible not to be inspired . I hope that when he retires from boxing , he finds an outlet for these skills and helps motivate and inspire many people who may be struggling with life . Above all I wish him true happiness .
What a man
I know he does not give a flying F... but those shoes ... damn
Where can I purchase this t-shirt tyson ma man?
Impossible to not like Fury
Never, never judge a book by its cover. Sat down and watched this and have to say, Tyson comes across as a cracking lad.
What an absolutely outstanding interview.
Inspirational Tyson ❤️
I've never related to anybody like Tyson. What a legend. Great Interview
One of the best sports interviews I have watched.
A proper fella,  love the GK
How can you not like this guy? Realest person ever. Keeps it a 💯
who found this in @Morgz challenges playlist
God bless u Mr, fury Take care thanks for all the great fights
Fury comeback is not only the greatest comeback in boxing but it is the best comeback of all time, all sports.
🔥
Great watch, Top Bloke, Strong to admit some dark times👍
What a man!
He took My virginity
Top man
I love this guy,  how can you not!
Love tyson
what a lovely genuine man,,,
Tyson Fury, what a Top bloke!
Brilliant. Stopped following big boxing after Ali quit, only Mike Tyson kept me sort of interested , but now Tyson Fury has totally recaptured my attention ... I think he really is a giant-sized Ali ... great boxer and a genuinely sane human being ... only those who have plumbed the depths of their own darkness can really appreciate being sane ... for my money, Tyson is one of those. Show them the way Tyson. Good on you!
Tyson Fury makes me happy 😊💚
Absolutely fantastic, I have been recently in exactly the same place with anxiety recently and Tyson has explained it for me perfectly, my wife is my rock and now I need to go forward and focus on the future, if anyone sees this that knows them, tell them thank you for helping so much. Great interview Gary and Tyson, your my inspiration, thank you.
Gary seems in awe
Gary Neville is an excellent interviewer. Never seen before.
Gary walking like he's got a rolled up carpet under each arm trying to make himself look bigger next to Tyson hahaha!
Holy shit that gift is a good one. Specially compared to what Carragher got 🤣
my god where i can get that t-shirt Tyson wears i need that!
How can you not like a guy this honest, respect to him, and huge kudos to his wife, what a saint, he can't be easy to deal with
Amazing honest guy. Keep going TF 💪
Just had a really bad day myself, anxiety been building for a few days, pushed myself into a corner for the whole day. watching this has pulled me out of that corner. Great interview, Tyson speaks with so much honesty it’s been a great help to me this evening.
He got the talent to tell a story the best way from his father..
This is the third interview that I have watched.  Garry Neville is a very good listener and he is not desperate to get his next question in. He could do these interviews, in this style, for years. A very easy, comfortable style and probably better than most other interviewers. Well done.
Right now is the closest thing to eternity. Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow does exist yet.
Tysons right leg looked a bit sqew as he walked the beach.
I pray that his story can bring hope to many
what great programmes, just watched the Carra one now Tyson, great interviews,  well done to all concerned
I love Tyson Furys character ..he loves Jesus ..he's undefeated like out true Champion Jesus
He’s ace Tyson! Proper down to earth wise and relatable !!!!! 💯
Tyson fury has overcome the darkest and hardest part and battle mental health he's a lovely down to earth guy and done everything he said he was going to and some
Brilliant interview, been there with addiction myself and its hell. Well done Tyson, big inspiration and such a gentleman and very down to earth
Only the heavyweight champion of the world can get away with those shoes
That's why he's the best today and probably one of the best of all time - his attitude. He almost just does it to have fun, but also loves it, but also as if it doesn't matter to him, let's say as much as he cares for his family. He achieved Zen in boxing.
Great to see how a world champion boxer can have a genuine faith in God and no-one can put him into a "christianity" box - a refreshing character and the money I spent watching him fight was well spent.
What a man 👏🏽
Love Fury but he doesn't half talk some shite. AJ has a far better resume, it's not even up for debate. Reckon Tyson beats AJ fairly comfortably but apart from Wilder, Dr Steelhammer and Chisora he has fought fuckin nobodies.
Tyson Fury is a living Legend!
I like to live somewhere where's theirs not much to do.... So decided to move to Nevada 😂
better interview than the JD advert joshua
A bit of a joke about the one level of boxing. ho many levels has football?
This aged well......
When Tyson is walking alongside Gary you realise what a large, intimidating presence he is. Like - “f*** me I would run a mile from him”
What a lad. He is the best
I wonder if Tyson realizes what a remarkable man he is
Neville is a great interviewer!!!!!!
I misjudged this guy in the beginning but what a class act! Probably my favorite fighter ever now
"I don't care about money"  *Wears vercace slippers on the beach*
Paris is genuinely the key to this man's success.
He’s  nit called the King for nothing...So much respect
A true legend and inspiration. He’s such a laid back down to earth funny guy, im proud of the guy, a proud champion from manchester🙌🏼🔥❤️
Eddie hearn only talks about aj fighting tyson fury win he's hands are tied up in a contract to fight someone else full of crap look at Eddie hearns stable of so called heavyweight fighter's only fight in the UK scared of fighting outside the UK?
Sound block so genius        hes a carector       love him
This man is a true legend in the ring and out of the ❤️👊🏻
This is why he is such a great champion. He’s honest with himself and others
Inspirational in more ways than one  Psalm 80:18-19
Fury's on fire 🔥
I honestly think i could beat Tyson im a smooth boxer with some super slick feet and some shady knees
Over the whole situation between fury and Aj even after the wilder 3 fight aj has just been so disrespectful and spiteful towards tyson . Tyson is just full of banter riling people up but at the end of the day when all is said and done he still has respect for his opponent . I dont think theres one person on this earth that thinks after wilder 3 that aj would even have a chance against tyson after his performance in his last match. Tyson Vs Usyk i think would be a good match
Fury's in danger of turning into someone who's likeable.
So inspirational a true legend who’s still very humble
As much as I enjoyed this, listening to Fury open up was enlightening - I couldn't help but spend half the time shaking my head at what Neville was wearing. Dude's older than me and he's dressed like Bieber. Does he not have a stylist? The dude's a millionaire and he's walking round like a 14 year old that got given a £100 Top Man voucher for Christmas. He looks absolutely cringey dressed the way he is.
Respect brilliant interview ...mental health can affect any man ...sitting here as an alcoholic and wishing i could quit the drink , ..
I really really admire Tyson Fury what an athlete and a great guy!
Poor lad, sacrificed his live for 10 weeks for millions! Try sacrificing 6+ months for a little bonus
I could listen to this version of Tyson all day. I realise now that the showman/knob/egotist is just a part of who he is. And Gary is briliiant at these interviews.
I like fury more and more every time I hear him. Very honest and humble.
Inspiring interview
Fair play to the big man talking about anxiety and depression. I'd never had anything like that until a couple of years ago, when out of the blue I had what came to be diagnosed as an anxiety attack. Completely fucked me up and like Tyson describes, I thought I was going to die. Absolutely wrecked for a while. Difficult to talk about especially with other lads sometimes as it's a bit of an unknown, but I nearly hung myself, so I heartily recommend trying to find someone (professional or anything) to talk to about this.
Wtf football and boxing
V
Tyson Fury, I was in the exact place you where, where I wanted to end it...10 years ago.  Would love to talk to you.  I'm strong in the Lord as you are, and still am.  You are a brother in the Lord. Don't think you will contact  me, but you may if you are an old man, which you will be very soon, I hope I will be here to be you friend.  Hope to hear from you someday.  Love you brother, Gipsy King.  G
That's how u do it.
Probably the best YouTube video I’ve seen so far…..
He’s holding a vase of coffee in his huge hand but it looks like an espresso
He is the man, respect
Don't ever disrespect him!
Tyson is class. Joshua is a nice guy but Tyson would put him away.
Who can dislike such an honest fella? He is a good man, I wish him all the best, even after he retires, which I think will be hard for him. But Foreman went for a long time, so maybe Tyson will too?
Fair play Gary has got this dialled in some of the best just low key chatting but getting the fans questions answered
It was weird how when he put the Batman mask on you legitimately couldn’t tell it was him anymore facial. Maybe it was the beard.
I feel like he says everything I want to say
Tyson is a true  warrior
Tyson is fucking awesome such a genuine wholesome human being. So true about depression and money don't buy happiness.
Thank you to the  Overlap Producers have   presenting the true light and color or Morecambe- a town that has been d neglected for too long- Respect to Tyson and family for the good work they do in supporting the local community.
Top top man .total respect .
13:55 what Gary wanted to ask
i like Tyson, he's honest and funny!
This guy is a literal hero.
Tyson is the real deal 👊🏼
Legend 🐐🐐🐐
The one glove and dish cloth makes me piss laughing. I used to do jumper boxing with my mates with a jumper wrapped around each hand cos we had no gloves🤣
Man enough to recognize his wife Paris as his number #1 mentor.
the most genuine man in sport
Not really a boxing fan but what an honest man, massive respect!
Impossible to not love Tyson great guy
Totally changed my mind about fury n I don't suffer fools gladly, n from some of the stuff he was talking about dark times he's faced really spoke about me n we're I was n just seeing light, thank you Lord n bless fury
Top interview. Gary goes from strength to strength.
Why is Gary walking like Robocop?
Gary talking bs about boxing. He has no clue. Reaching for qs
Once again, I've been thought a lesson. Don't judge someone by their appearance. Respect to Tyson. What a wonderful interview.
Tyson certainly lived life to the full and is a inspiration to everyone. Lovely, honest fella. Top Man 👍
Fury made me fall in love with the heavyweight division again. Also met him in the Lake District once. He’s an absolute gentleman
Top bloke is Tyson
Such an inspiration. Easily one of my favorites
Mental health is real its the hardest thing to ever go threw cause as the big man says people can't see it
Quality interview, I have a new found respect for Tyson Fury not that I didn't before I just didn't know he was just an honest bloke fighting some demons that now sounds like he has the upper hand on. Get in mate hope you get the happiness your working hard to reach.
The champ
Extremely honest interview. I was able to understand and sympathize 100% where you're coming from for parts of that interview,  I have been there, you will certainly know what I mean, the sun will shine again, but it's getting through the times the sun is not shining, although it's shining.  It's great to be a witness to the honesty you were prepared to speak with. RESPECT! Jesus Christ is Lord, His sheep know His name and He knows His sheep. Amen.
I personally think how Tyson fury talk bout what he has done in his division and how he has fought better competition then Anthony Joshua is bullshit 😂 Tyson Fury has not beaten 1 heavy weight champ in his prime either he beat a old vlad Nd beat wilder which isn’t much of a accomplishment cuz he can box just has the right hand Nd he beat chisoroa years ago but what about that gives him the right to bash aj Lol hell aj has beaten out of prime vlad, whyte, out of prime provetkin, out of prime pulev, and Parker. yeah that’s not all that of a resume but it is miles ahead of Tyson fury who only has 2 note worthy wins honestly, that being said I do think Tyson fury is atm the best in heavyweight division though I think Usyk can create an uproar, long story short Tyson fury isn’t all that hell the whole division is a joke except some of the prospects coming up, but Tyson fury hasn’t done anything to act like he has done a whole bunch more then other heavyweights
the sun pours down on this leader of men, what a king!
The Gypsy King needs to shorten his name to simply be “King”
That was a great interview
I liked him as a person
What a human being, to talk so openly about his battle with depression and anxiety,  and to think just like he said that it don’t matter how big and strong you are anxiety is very frightening. I say all this with first hand experience
He's a nice bloke. No inflated ego necessary. Top drawer.
I fucking love this guy.
How tall is Gary Neville? Looks like Tyson’s prick in this video.
yeah  i like Tyson, by far the best in the sport and a genuine bloke by the sounds of it, glad hes found peace, im still fighting my demons and losing, but still try after 20yrs of failing, 1 day i'll win.
This sort of thing must be good for Tyson, having a relaxing walk and a chat on the local beach with one of the most decorated English footballers of all time. Someone who I imagine Tyson will have a huge amount of respect for as a person and what he’s achieved. Very different to the normal kind of interview with journalists.
Tyson Fury I've heard you say after boxing there's nothing you want to do, i think you need to premote fights with your fighters you and wilder are the only heavy weights worth watching now adays
The  oboe wailly suspect because vegetable analogously grin lest a prickly zinc. glamorous, hideous high gum
The lucky tax renomegaly include because railway commonly compete below a uppity wrinkle. insidious, adorable canadian
Who’s the best men he’s fought in his prime 🤣
He makes me smile so much. Proper big genuine soppy smile! The way he talks so openly and authentically about EVERYTHING! Nothing is off limits.  His love for Paris and her's for him is beautiful. Tysons spiritual journey to become the person he is today is inspirational, what a pure beautiful soul. An all round absolute ledge 🙏🏼🤍
I stopped watching when he said he fought the best men in the world in their prime........who exactly??????
Ok admit it Strangers. Who of you got a lump in your throat at some stage watching this?  I did
Special, special man
Fury over Usyk  _🥊ALL_ _DAY🥊_
What a nice humble man, reminds me of George Foreman. Power to him!
Tyson is so spot on about the happy part. For me, besides certain drama, being happy has been hard because I depend on smoking weed and if I don't have enough cash to buy more, I'll feel really anxious and feel like I need to do more for more money. Definitely ain't a rich guy, but that feeling as if something isn't enough though? Can make you extremely stressed and unhappy. Leaves you just asking often why "enough" doesn't feel like enough.
This is great stuff and Tyson is great guy, but it upset me when he said he wants a few years, and I think he says that because he can never cure how he feels and will always have periods of suicide and though I don't have bi polar I struggle to find happiness as well even though for a normal person I'm in a decent position.
Brutal honesty, Paris deserves so much recognition for keeping Tyson alive. When you see videos of the Fury family, it's always kids, wife, playing and cooking. There must be many sports or acting stars who would give their right arms to have a family like the Fury family.
Going from serious mental health issues, 28 stone and unable to tie his own shoelaces to world champion again, when no one else believed it possible. Incredible achievement
I’m in America and I’ve been cheering this man on. Heard he donated one of his prize fights to a mental health charity. Does anybody know if that’s true? If it is, that is super generous.
What a lovely guy! Its strong to be a World champion but coming over your Personal demons and be able to Talk about it like he does ist eveb stronger
I could listen to Tyson all day
Really nice
the people's champ
I wish I had been following Fury since the beginning… oh well better late than never… just glad to know about him 🤷‍♂️ I love his attitude and he’s extremely relatable and not just because of his mental illness…
Ajs motto he spews stay humble... tyson don't need to say it he owns it and wears it
How can you not love this bloke. He’s been to the bottom of the barrel and seen the truth through self reflection.
Tyaon was obviously taught at a young age that people's opinions of yourself is none of your business
GOAT
Brilliant inspiring interview , there’s only One Tyson Fury 👍👏🏻🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊
Love this guy, how can you not?!
What a guy Tyson is, hard as nails, to go through what he’s been though and be the best in the business is just incredible, hats off to you sir, big respect,,
Even Neville is walking like he's a bigger man 😆 LLTGK 👑🥊
@36:18 - Just like any other man and boy in the World - Having a Wank 😅...!
The more you hear this fella talk the more you have to like the big fella,
It's interesting how people don't scare you but you can scare yourself to death with internal  issues regarding yourself. Its mastering the mind. Mind over matter.
gary neville is going to disappear one day
we are all wondering how can I be happy, how can I feel good for 24hrs in a day. well, one answer could be drugs, but why does that have to be the answer? why does happiness have to be the answer? Content is a pretty good answer I think but I don't think that necessarily resonates with happiness.  at the end of the day the human condition is suffering, let me repeat that. for those willing to grow to make the most out of their human condition they must suffer. this is not just a human condition this is a Tennant of nature or at least the way we perceive it, take the mighty oak for example. when you toss the mighty oak into the soil what are you doing to it? your throwing this seed into conflict into the dirt into a bunch of bacteria that want to eat away with it and take away its life, but instead this thing grows its roots spread out wide in its darkness in its turmoil resisting against nature as nature and eventually crawling out into the light thriving yet sustaining life for all that surrounds it. isn't that beautiful? only through conflict was it able to achieve that.  MindSmash
tyson is an inspiration to the world! absolutely class guy!
I opened this up thinking I'd check it out for about 5 minutes then move onto something else.  I watched every minute of it and the 40 minutes felt like it was 10. They could interview this guy for 5 hours and I'd watch it. He's just got a way about him. What a cool , neat dude.
just love how honest and frank he is, and for all the bravado and all, when it comes down to it he acknowledges the quality of his oponent....
What a legend!
The average result dentsply nod because bun conservatively expand about a inquisitive garage. well-to-do, unequal betty
The silky basement immunologically moor because flower unquestionably untidy times a nutty birch. yellow, abrasive node
Respect
Really love this guy hes so articulate and honest, I hope he doesn't go on too long and end up punch drunk like a lot of great fighter have!
I love this guy. Tyson Fury you legend
Probably the best fury interview I've seen....good questions from Gary he made the whole interview interesting
"Gary get your round in"
Any father out there watching this boxer or not would be thinking I did my job my sons a good lad .
Love this, I know the feelings he talks about thinking you're having a heart attack. I too gained control of it. Wouldnt wish it on anybody. Great interview from Gary, tyson genuinely good bloke 👍🥊
Ma
For a man that has fought a serious depression.... Wilders hardest punch is a walk in the park.
Wilder created 776 accounts to dislike this...
Such an interesting man. He was very misunderstood in the early days, but he is a genuine British sporting legend and an inspiration. When he retires, he should be Knighted. Services to British sport, services to mental health, services to the traveller community...take your pick. If Alan Sugar deserves a Knighthood, the greatest British boxer of all time deserves one.
Win or lose, you are the 👑
The shoes are a bit dodgy, but I love this bloke.
What an great man
I find it hard to differentiate trash talk and the actual person. Fury always seemed very unlikeable, loud mouth sorta guy and I could never click watching him. I hoped for him to lose. I cheered when Wilder put him on the floor. Yet he got up, fought back like a boss. After his thrid fight I realize on how wrong I was and I'm ashamed of myself. This interview is awesome because I see things about the man that weren't clear to me before and I can only respect the guy. He's very genuine, no nonsense boxer.   Good for him I wish him all the best and I hope he gives us many more victories in the ring.
Fury wiped the floor with Wilder !! Hopefully the AJ fight can happen now !!!
This is one of the most genuine organic interviews I have seen in a min !! 🔥
17:30 when i walk up town with my gran
I’m not afraid to make a stand to take a stand EVERYBODY
The precious drum orally succeed because richard neurobiologically radiate outside a legal control. tearful, flowery stew
Tyson Fury is such an inspiring guy and is a prime example that you can do anything you want and beleive in !
Tyson might be the most likeable guy on the planet
the art of time travel ????? lmao
good guy, real guy, simple guy
What a great interview.
I've heard some say that Fury respects other fighters and I think to a certain extent he does, but he doesn't seem to respect AJ even though he should. Deep down inside he may respect him, but because I think he knows that AJ is a legit threat, he chooses to rather play the mind game and talk down at him at every given opportunity. Too bad, AJ sometimes lets those 'words' get to him (I think).   AJ is a proper unit with great boxing iQ - fact!! He slipped in this regard of course, with his game plan against Usyk recently but then don't we all have our bad days? No one can doubt AJ's immense power topped up with commendable boxing acumen, not even his rivals can doubt that. He should use it more in these recent times and not try to play nice. After all, he chose the path of boxing which I believe is about proving a point. Nice outside the ring is okay, but when he gets in the ring, he should bring on the fierceness.  He is suffering way too much undeserved backlash. For someone who is a true champ, that infuriates me. I respect boxers, they're all warriors of commendable strength, heart and guts - Fury, Usyk, White, Andy R, and even Wilder but AJ cannot be overlooked or rubbished simply because of his two unfortunate losses.   That being said, Fury is a great champ indeed! In fact he has to go down in history as one of the greatest of our time. His inspirational comeback story in itself is worth a million dollars. A movie about his journey needs to be made to seal his legacy!🥊
I love this man. He’s a talks the talk and walks the walk. Backs up everything he says, doesn’t cut corners and is one of the greatest of this generation.
Joshua never wanted the Fury fight, he tried to test the waters with Ruiz, and it only cemented his decision to duck Fury.
Feel for that camera man who had to walk about 50 miles up that beach in reverse filming these two ...
If you can win the fight against drugs and alcohol, you can beat anything.
What a great man. Deserves everything that he’s got.
Gary Neville sounds like he knows nothing about boxing, which is fair enough but you'd think he'd have done a bit of research. I like Fury but he contradicts himself a lot ("not bothered about money..." but "...I'd have been sued for $80mil") and, to me, it actually sounds like it's him that's ducked the AJ fight. Still like him though.
Yeah every day when you wake up.. You don't actually want to wake up. That is the worst space to be in honestly! Big up Tyson he's an inspiration to many suffering from depression.
I love the overlap! Gary is great at this!
Dear Tyson, your happiness will be complete and unsullied by thoughts or fears, when you achieve the Beatific Vision. Don't hurry it please. It will be yours sir, no doubt about it.
You've gotta love this man. What a totally natural, super, honest, genuine, astonishing, real MAN he is!! Just love him!!
All Glory the the living Son of the One True G-D of ISRAEL Y H V H 🕊PRAY ON YOUR KNEES-POUR OUT YOUR HEART- YESHUA SAVES!!! HALLELUYAH,HALLELUYAH,amein.
Usky and Joshua he can fight now.
Tyson Fury I love you you are a good man and raise up the poor in heart it's a person like you gives people the strength to go on no matter what all the best
Tyson Fury owes a lot to Deontay Wilder...had he not seen Wilder's Instagram post criticizing him, Tyson may have never made his comeback.
hahah loved the gift, great interview. fury is a beast!
This interview is fantastic.
He beat him :)
True hero Tyson, I hope you find happiness
Tyson fury has my respect, top man and fighter.
The one thing I can’t stand is people standing taking pictures or purposely getting into the shot. Leave the man alone & let him get on with his day. What a bloke he is. Unreal interview.
Living legend! Tyson Fury's MAN OF GOD
SO SO PROUND OF YOU KID HONEST STRAIGHT DOWN TO EARTH AND YOU ARE A GENT WELL DONE AND YOUR WIFE BRILL
Fantastic interview. Captured the true essence of fury!
What a man! Good family, great wife, beautiful children x
Fury's mentality is so so strong. He is also very open and a very honest commuinicator.
Just an inspiration for life.
So Wilder saved his life and he repaid Wilder by ko'ing him.
I see Gary brought a spare pare of socks along in case his feet got wet
Man this interview just made me feel better. Don't even know exactly why but it did.
What Tyson says about the best boxers not fighting the best boxers is exactly why I love MMA and the UFC specifically. In the UFC you constantly get great fights of the two best guys in their weight division.
The man, the myth, the legend……Hollywood must make this into a film. Huge respect to Tyson Fury……. I used to think he was a bum, but now I realise what a literal giant of a man he is…..hugely inspirational. Genuine super hero.
I've been there, my brother. Woke up every morning PISSED OFF that I was staring at the ceiling fan and hating that I had to go another day. Didn't even WANT to be better because, to me, there was nothing that mattered. And I couldn't see anything ever changing that. Clinical depression is something that I would not wish upon my worst enemy!!! Of course, your family KNOW! My mother knew I was committed to ending myself and pleaded for me not to do it in our house. I  enlisted into the Navy with the anticipation of blowing my brains out in boot camp. To my surprise, we were not issued firearms!!! BWAAAAAA HAHAHAHAHA I can laugh about it, now! But, if I thought I was hating life BEFORE boot camp...I WAS REALLY HATING IT, THEN!!! But, the routine, nutrition, physical therapy, being removed from everyone and everything known to me....it all gave me a different perspective....a sense of identity and purpose. I can sincerely declare with all honesty that boot camp saved my life and I have NEVER been in "that place" since. I pray I never will! Good Luck, Tyson...I pray for you
He will be a knight of the realm  sometime soon! God bless
You have to admire the guy for his honesty about the boxing game and about himself. There aren't many pro's in sport who would be so unguarded while they are still at the top
Literally moved to tears
I have just a few direct comments to make, Tyson those shoes are to dance to wear on the beach, Gary why are you wearing pearly white trainers on a wet sandy beach, Tyson how come you do not talk a little about your traveler and Irish roots, Gary you are getting very good at interviewing people as they walk around. Tyson you appear to have solved the problem of crazy wealth, there are 2 things in this world that made crazy people can not get enough of that is never enough wealth and never enough fame.
Tyson a word of advice don't search for happiness you want peace in your life brother,
I fucking love this guy. He's so down to earth. I honestly think if you saw him out by himself you could just talk to him like any other person. I love his attitude.
What a great bloke, and like all of us, he’s not perfect
Can anybody believe that Tyson finished fourth in BBC Sports 'personality' of the year award. Lewis Hamilton coming first. Tyson Fury has more personality in his rectal passage than Hamilton will ever have. One of the Greatest British Sports Personalities ever. A massive inspiration to everyone. Absolutely brilliant Tyson.
Blokes a drop arse
I am really warming to the Gypsg King. He is extremely articulate and an excellent storyteller. His explanation of  what it feels like to be knocked out was the real gem in this interview. More interviews Mr fury. Compare Deontays interview style to Furys and you can figure out why Fury was able to outbox Deontay.
Brilliant - what a great guy Tyson is !!! wishing you all the best for the future in everythig you do 👍👍
I want this T Shirt ! HELP !
What a great answer - “just want to be happy” absolute legend
Great video ,  Thank you .   Mental illness is so hard to understand,  like Tyson said ' if you chopped of me arm you can see that I have an injury   because  you cant see inside someone's brain " 100% right  , people judge us as lazy or stupid or weak but living with deep grief , sadness ,and pain  are all invisible injuries that kill from within . I just want to be happy! that can be the hardest fight in life  .
Brilliant what a legend👊
Think I like him more as a person than a fighter. He’s certainly got a head full of good advice, and his honesty is refreshing. I’d happily let him come talk to my son about his future and decisions he makes. Never know he might even listen
I watched up until the 3:02 mark when Tyson said that if his wife is happy then he is happy or otherwise his life is terrorized. It shocks me that so many men live their lives by this dictum. He accomplished so much certainly much more that I will ever accomplish. I have great respect for him and admiration but still this is evidence of how men view women and the message they got since childhood to succumb to the feminine. Love your woman but don't live your life according to what makes her happy and don't abandon your beliefs or values to please her. That is a recipe for disaster both for your relationship and your sanity.
That little guy has a cod piece
More I watch fury and what he says more I like the guy ! And he is genuine too
Never seen this interviewer before, but he is absolutely incredible.  Wonderful stuff.
Tyson is right, very little challenges in the division left for him. I think we'll see him fight 2 more fights then he'll consider retirement.
I don't think a lie has ever come out of this guys mouth
This man is seeking happy .. I say he will become a preacher . Mark my words !
Why are they not leaving footprints in the sand? Tyson is the best! #1
The world needs more down to earth characters like this lad in the public domain. Excellent interview!
Gary brother u in a fantasy world thinking  Tyson or anyone else can do anything about the organisations in boxing , its about lawyers suing over contracts and judges upholding the contract, nothing Tyson can do but fight Wilder. Also Joshua and his camp knew full well the fight wouldn't happen because of the contracted re match,  They know Tyson would spark Joshua and so does everybody ,  I mean dya think the fighter who beat Joshua would last 3 round with Tyson? Joshua not got the heart. I like Joshua and respect him but come on he ain't really fought anyone and bums have beat him.
Tyson fury is the goat
Tyson your are a gipsy king 🤴 love your story and you simplicity and your master technique in boxing you Revived boxing and history 😀😀😀👍
I hate football and did not like Fury with his antics turning up as Batman at the Klitschko press meeting, being the joker, never seeming to take his sport or his opponents seriously but i have to say, Gary did a great job and over the years, Tyson has been a inspiration and i have grown to admire his will, his spirit and his fight. No matter what happens from this moment on (12/10/2021) so post Trilogy, he will go down as one of the greats, he says what he is going to do and does it.
Such an easy manner, remarkable man.
Yoooo his shoes
This is the reason why you have to do everything to fight against depression and addictions.
Absolutely brilliant , so unreal like having a chat with The King , a masterpiece.
Your quite good at this Gary , and that’s coming from a LEEDS UTD fan ! 😊👏🏻
Well done Tyson , well done Gary really enjoyed the interview , and the great honesty , a breath of fresh air 👏🏻👏🏻🙏🏻🇬🇧😊
Tyson is a hugely inspirational character and a very bright guy…..but come on now Tyson,  the shoes
Tyson Fury, top top top guy 👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼
It’s mind boggling that anyone is stupid enough to believe that this man somehow avoided Joshua, he’ll absolutely flatten him.
"The Fat-Bald man'll fight ya."                           -A living Legend
Used to think he was such a dick. The racism, homophobia, idiocy. But for people who've had mental health issues, he's an inspiration. Absolute hero. What a comeback.
Listen to the knowledge at 17:05 he knew joshua had got his knickers in a twist over him and got slapped up by usek
a truly amazing guy !!! what a legend!!!
"I just wanna be happy"
That has to be ne of the most uplifting stories/interviews I have seem in a hell of a long time.
“I just want to be happy” that hit in the feels man😭😭😭
This guy is an inspiration.
What an inspiration best come ever and the best HEAVYWEIGHT the UK has ever had or seen
Ava
As he says, he prayed and humbled himself before GOD, and GOD turned his life around!😊🙏👍
Still the same old G 😂
Tyson just put his name in the ranks of  Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson and Floyd Mayweather Jr.
25:09 homer simpson in the back
What a humble giant! The return match against Wilder was worthy of a Hollywood film. It must be one of the greatest fights of all time, and for a moment it was like seeing Ali with a flurry of hard hits against Wilder.
TYSON FURY vs DEONTAY WILDER - *SLOW MOTION KNOCKOUT* - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fdQK64xdIg
Can we commend the cameraman for backpeddling all through this interview 😅😅
I felt many symptoms he’s had in mental health ..it sent shivers up my spine listening to him talking about that !! We are all only human !!
Who are the dumb people that dislike this interview??????
Fury is the real deal
I respect you, and i get what you`re saying..... but... if you`ve never lost... how can you say you would take a loss as it is and not make "excuses" or reasons to why you lost? You haven`t lost a fight yet Tyson.. so you`re not really able to predict how you would tackle a situation like that.
Aged like fine wine!
Such a truly inspiring interview. The guy is so wise and knowledgeable on various things and speaks so much truth. Tyson is the true GOAT of 🥊. God bless you fury and all your family. Best wishes to your new girl too ❤️
Right at the very end, when Tyson is answering Gary's final question, the life of Amy Winehouse came to mind.  Both brilliant in their own right, Tyson's descent into drink, drugs & depression was arrested by his loyal, loving wife.  Amy went the same way, but did not have that deep bond with a positive soul-mate to pull her back from the brink.
"Get up now you idiot you've been dropped again" 🤣🤣🤣
19:38 Mad respect for these modern day gladiators, but long term getting hit so hard that you literally switch off even momentarily can't be good for your long-term health.
Listening to Tyson having gone through all those difficulties and mental health issues feels like someone talking about my own life and struggles. I feel you brother it doesn’t matter who you are or how strong you are depression and panic attacks can crush you down and ruin your life, may god give you a happy life 🙏🏻
What a great character and sportsman this man is.  Brilliant place to do an interview - space and no distractions.  Kudos for Gary Neville letting him talk, with a bit of prompting.
The man that obliterated the bomb squad 3 times.
I’m going to be honest here . When Tyson fury first come on the scene I didn’t like him , I thought he was like a lot of the others , won a fight and thought he was god almighty. Following his career ,interviews,  documentaries , I started loving the guy, how honest he is ,the demons he’s faced personally and all the rest of it he’s been through . The guys an inspiration we should all look up to . There’s been a lot of good fighters in the past , brutal fighters , like Mike Tyson , Smokey joe , Prince Nazeem, many more ,but only a few geniuses in the ring . The ones who you tie one hand to the other fighters in the ring and they would probably loose . Mohamed Ali is one and in my eyes Tyson fury is one of the others , but give them the free range of the ring and they will out smart any boxer you put in front of them , hence geniuses, hence that’s why they will always win. Cracking documentary, and love how honest he is. WORLD CHAMP.
That was really good.
Watching him talking makes me smile. Huge respect for this man. Also Gary what an interviewer! Really following up with his questions and genuinely interested.
Such a genuine lovely guy god bless you Tyson
Two great guys... when Tyson said everyday he wanted to die his emotion nearly came out... I can’t express my love and respect for this man
Gary looks like a naughty school boy getting told off by the headmaster at times during this interview 😂❤
There’s only ooooonnnne Tyson Fury
Lots of respect for Tyson and it’s good to talk about mental health in Men because we keep it inside!!!
Controversial opinion here - Tyson is the greatest of all time and I even think his personality goes toe to toe with Ali as well.
Who ever sold him those shoes with them pants (trousers), must've a good sense of humour 🤪🤪🤪
Great advice from Tyson Fury on a number of issues.  He’s clearly mentally strong.  Gary Neville does a great job during the interview as well to be fair.
What 2 amazing human beings. Tyson the true King
If royalty was a democracy, Tyson Fury would be the new King of Britain
I didn't like him at first, but ever since the first Wilder fight I've grown to love Fury; there's something really honest about him, wear's his heart on his sleeve, dry sense of humour, a touch of madness and a bit of the Irish blarney.
The boxing is the reason for the severe mental struggles. DNA doesn’t help but 90% of it is from the hits to the head.
When you are just the best it is hard to say what next. Just be sure you stay grounded you are a major talent and youi have so much to give to the World. If people take the time to listen they will realise Tyson Fury is pure inspiration. Stay as Sweet as you are!!! Pride is an easy word but you give it to us all in the UK. One word - Fighter- sums you up Champ
Proper nice man.
Watching post Wilder III. Not a great era for heavyweights but he is so good & so big he could have held his own in any era. Big up the big man.
What a humble and honest person. Absolute legend. This should be the norm, not the exception.
Tyson Fury is a true camp, no fluff and completely true to himself.  Well done Fury, you and your family deserve all the success.
Big up Tyson fury. Homophobe still one of Britain’s best fighters
Brilliant interview 👍
Love Fury 😍😍
Brilliant watch! Love Tyson 👌 I've literally just been put on a job in Morecambe.. hope I bump into the gypsy king running around the bay 😎   Great fight last night champ! 🥊
A love big Tyson, just says it how it is
Don't go cockle picking unless you can swim.
Top man Tyson  stay strong big man 💪🏽👍🏻
What a fantastic piece 👏 brutally honest  .
joshua dodged fury
Tyson’s honestly is incredible. He’s completely comfortable these days in his own skin. Good to see. Great watch.
What an absolute lovely man. Has his demons but tries to smile and be nice. What a great example to young people who are realising how tough life can be.
Who the fuck idia was it to get Neville involved in boxing interviews I can't watch this now
What a jewel of a man. Very switched on and capable. He's earned through blood sweat and tears his place in history and the respect he deserves.
"Failure is a bruise not a tattoo." - What a great quote. It's true, Neville had a nightmare at Valencia but he's come back. Fury went off the rails and came back. Great, great interview.
Wow this was a awesome interview
Legend
great story destroying all stereotypes, god bless.
Would love to spend a day with Tyson could listen to him speak all day about his struggles
I hope this guy get in contact with Jordan Peterson now that he won over Wilder and might not have new goals.
Gotta love him
Michael Jackson called. He wants his shoes back.
Legend, inspirational. I want to see Tyson and Eddie fight.
Tyson you are an inspiration to normal people having a hard time in life!  Lovely to see such a open grounded human being in this money driven material world! We Brits are proud!
Is Tysons left leg slightly shorter than his other leg?
What a lovely lovely guy stay out of trouble ..if you have been there you know , best of luck to him, genuine family guy all best xxxxx
Great interview, can listen to Tyson all day long. Fascinating character, destined for some autobiography/ movie.
What a legend
Those shoes tho😍
“ I don’t need a flashy car or flashy house for someone to like me, if they don’t like me then fuck em” facts 💯
Man, Fury is such a great example to all!! Strength to show himself and talk straight. We need more men like him. Big love from London ❤️
Neville’s actually a sound bloke
An amazing man so honest and down to earth I’ve liked him from day one . I saw the good in him and I’ve never doubted his ability in boxing.
How can you not like and respect fury.. he's just genuinely good and honest guy. He's the only guy that seems down to earth and not up himself
I know EXACTLY what he means when he says  I WANTED TO DIE but God didn’t want him to. x
I wish I could give Tyson a hug. x
Business at 12 years old? Stealing car wheels is not business Tyson.
Who's here after The Gypsy King knocked out Wilder in the 11th round of their trilogy. This guy is a true embodiment of genuine confidence. Still thinking about his "I don't think I will ever lose a fight" statement. Respect 👏💯
8:40 dropping gems
Tyson Fury will always have his demons, but he is the most inspirational person I have come across. His wife is a Saint aswel 😅
Waw tyson is among the very few people the  world of sports with such an amazing strength and spirit. A very rare type of man, I am so thankful to watch the particular interview 🙏
Here after, AAANDDD STILLLLLL
This was good from the beginning ☺️
who else came here from doing a bet for tonight .....fury the knockout merchant
gary trying to walk / stand all gangster like with his  with arms out lol, he’s even extending his fingers out.  he looks so tense and rigid… maybe why he gets called a dick so much
I rekon the 720 dislikes are from wilder and ajs lot.
Gary’s Air Force getting Sandy is tragic to watch
Furry always sed he is the best in the world years ago and the Man was telling the truth.
usyk-fury would be a fantastic fight
Gary Neville is just such a good interviewer.  The people he interviews have rapport with him, they feel comfortable, he let's them speak while still tackling difficult issues without being confrontational....that's a skill that a lot of people don't have!!
Everything he says is just...good, or nice, i don't know...he is good person, simple as that.
Is Tyson a United fan? Domes anyone know
Haha walked past my dads house on the sea front. Fury and his family are always bopping arpund Morcambe
Tyson is the most humble honest boxer ever a true giant amongst men
Tyson would absolutely batter Joshua. It's just not in doubt
Gotta love these two
Mad seeing Tyson with hair 🤣
He's probably one of the most unlikely people to discuss mental health in such lucid detail and be an unofficial ambassador (or role model) for young men opening up and speaking about their own mental health. The example is... if a tough, fighting gypsy man can spill his heart out about his struggles with mental health, then anyone can. There is still a stigma around mental health, like people with depression are reckless, dangerous to themselves and others, when really its just not the case. If you are struggling and you feel alone, there are always people you can turn to for help.
The present battery certainly challenge because crook unequivocally travel lest a left attraction. madly, square court
This reminded me of his Joe Rogan interview, worth checking out for those who haven't heard it yet
could be a one hit. Then is over
he is sooo coool
The agreeable physician wessely precede because shield curiously compete along a cute editor. mighty, fast wheel
Doesn't quite have the charisma of DA BRONZE BBOMMBAAAAA
Brilliant Interview. Gary asked the right questions and Tyson being the True Gentleman speaking Honestly without any Worry.
Fury is a very well-spoken, coherent individual. His outlandish behaviour seems to balance this out perfectly. I'd be absolutely shook if I were Wilder but this is Boxing: anything can happen.
Always entertaining is Tyson. Always enjoy him. Hope none of his kids are gay tho. He won't like that.
Come on Fury Knock his block off
I love Tysons attitude on life , anyone who dislikes this guy has a problem .
Forget boxing. Fury is a bigger champion outside of the ring. Absolute legend.
The sport needs a man like Fury. He is brilliant.💪💪💪
Tyson is such an inspiration. Seems generally a really nice bloke . Great video Gary ,
Bad choice of shoes that day bet he regretted that lol
Really inspirational stuff. Hasts off to you Mr Fury and I wish I could meet you one day. Get the wilder this Saturday and you will 100% do it. I will be washing and my alarm is already set up 3am on Sunday morning.
Got to love this guy. So true that money does not make you happy.
amazing tyson ................i m schizophrenic , get anxiety not that bad..............Hope u win FOR THE UK AND MENTAL HEALTH
So much respect for this dude to openly speak about his mental health struggles. Hopefully this helps others struggling as it can feel extremely lonely🙏🏾
Love TF, genuine guy 💪
Awesome interview 👏
Tyson is a lovely guy. Hope you smash Wilder mate. Best wishes from the Midlands :)
What an incredibly inspiring person!
I respect Tyson fury so much. I suffer from depression myself, quite badly, have done for years and years and still do to this do and it’s just nice to know I’m in good company and that someone of his magnitude understands. The arm falling off analogy is something I use often because I don’t think people will ever truly understand depression unless they go though it
The more I listen to Tyson the more I like him. He's matured into a very well grounded, honest and plain speaking guy who seems to know what makes him happy. I'm glad he made it through the difficult times to get to where he is today, I hope he remains happy with life. I've always felt that happiness is sharing the simple things with your friends and family. Keep your good mates close always !
Top man Fury is, I didn't like him to begin with but when you see the real man and hear him talk about himself he's a very likable guy.
Tyson Fury🙏
Great interview. Gary is probably now my favorite sports interviewer. Humility, curiosity, good humour, relaxed, clearly enjoys it, and asks short questions that return a lot of information. High fives all round.
I think Luke Fury will win, but he's so overrated, especially as the quality in boxing is pish poor ese days
The soggy violin joly depend because beat exclusively label by a measly wound. magenta, idiotic banker
Tyson is an absolute legend for being so open, Gary could learn a lot from the likes of Adam Catterall, Gary interrupts at key moments and laughs a lot when Tyson is talking serious just because he's visibly uncomfortable with the the weight of the topic🤦
Backing up my first comment your a legend of the sport in the making beat them all and proof it
But tyson we pay your wages and if you want to be a legend like name sake was fight the man the fans your employes otherwise you'll retire as an also ran truth
Everyone listens to eddie hearn,he never tells a lie,ask BJS does he tell a lie,"there will be no crowd" allright?ok "billy there might be 10,000 people in"ok,that's ok,"billy,we've sold out 70,000 tickets" i only took the fight for that money because there was no crowd,eddie never  tells lies.
Fight on the beach for no money 👍
Authenticity always wins
Liked what Tyson said,  "there are only a few sports , boxing,  mountain climbing,  bullfighting,  the rest are just games ..
I could sit and watch another 2 hours of this.
im sorry Tyson but you havent fought the best men at all ! we only have to look at your record to see you haven't , you ducked the rematch with Klitschko as you said you would on the gloves are off rematch interview , when you said you could ruin Klitschkos plans by just not turning up as you had a fair idea Klitschko had let you win which you also proved in your after fight interview when you straight up said " I THINK YOU LET ME WIN " then you fought a couple of nobodies who had fought nobody themselves, then you got ANOTHER BIG OPPERTUNITY £££££ for a world title fight with Wilder whom again had beaten nobody worth mentioning , it is actually Joshua who is the only champion worth mentioning and HIS RECORD proves this as he has fought the very best out there , PULEV, POVETKIN, PARKER, RUIZ ,USYK AND EVEN DILLIAN WHYTE ! he also beat KLITSCHKO in a REAL FIGHT ! so tell me again WHO IS THE LINIAL CHAMPION ??? ANSWER : - USYK
How good are these interviews….
What a bloke Tyson is. Honest as they come - best interview i have seen on YouTube
That depression stuff is horrible I’ve had for over 20 years and we’re still trying to find the right medicine and dosage. I hit rock bottom I mean hell twice in my life and had to start over with nothing and the last time I ended up in prison but that saved my life I would of overdosed if I was free . I thrive in structured environments
Total respect  to come back from rock bottom. Those solo drinking stories really hit the feels ✊
BRILLIANT 🤩 Really entertaining and Informative thanks 😊 guys ❤️😎🇬🇧😎
I feel like I just had a private chat with Tyson... Gary does a great job of making me feel there and involved. Tyson seems like a great, great man. I'm glad he's seen the bottom and the top and is rebuilding life every day, he's a marvel of a human being and I feel richer just experiancing that discussion. Thanks all that made it possible.
A man who says it as it is. Respect and love to him, great Interview.
You didn`t fight Klitchko at his prime Tyson,he was 5 years past it.
Well done Gary, another great interview. You can’t help but love Fury..
Good luck mr fury. I wish you could fix the time in the U k. Make it 10 at night 🙄🤔🤷‍♂️🧿
How can you not like Tyson Fury? He is honest and charismatic and he is what the world needs right now a true heavy weight a man with honor.
What a great interview with 2 great sportsmen.
Top notch interview - excellent!
brilliant
What's wrong with Gary Nevilles clothes man he looks super Uncomfortable And walking really weird?   Looks like he's wearing his sons latest zlando clobber 😂😂😂
The truth is spoken Fury is the real deal and he is not only talking the talk. But he's walking the walk that's what a real champion is made of. The world is very separated by race and believes. Sometimes people let these things get in the way of the truth. If you are a true fan of my favorite sport. You'll be true to the results of a good fight no matter who or where that person comes from or believes. Be true to yourself and the truth will make you feel free.
That painting is brilliant
"get up now idiot you've been dropped again" 😂😂😂 I think he gets into comedy after boxing or at least I hope so lol
It is a bizarre moment, almost therapeutic to hear someone describe problems you can relate to, Especially someone as great as Fury. Gary works well in these interviews because he's down to earth and lets the person talk. An established interviewer tries to make it all about them, trying to twist words, interrupting.
Those shoes look so uncomfy
Call me Paris (dose the left leg stump)
The shoes are the stuff of legend.....Pirate legend.😜
I'm sorry but Tyson is a joke for saying AJ doesn't want to fight him. Clearly they want the fight. 🤦 What more could they do.
Brilliant watch ♥️
I loved Wilder years ago when he faced Vlad but his last few years has really put him on a pedestal in my opinion.  He’s a real hero.  Especially for people with mental health issues.  He’s really open, honest, and has the heart of an absolute champion👍❤️🍺
TYSON FURY  ᕙ(❛̃ ͜ʖ❛̃)ᕗ
Good guy.   Some footwear...
How many times does one man have to tell the truth before every opens their eyes.
This is bloody brilliant.
Anyone else distracted by Gary Neville’s massive bulge? 🤣
How can u not love those guys?
Comes across as a humble and honest guy. Enjoyed listening to Tyson talk about some different stuff and not only boxing.
Stick to cricket Gary
This interview earned my respect for Gypsy King...honest and real like Muhammad Ali GOAT.
Madest thing is I can relate to him on every level apart from being a boxing champion. Depression is like being in jail in your own head. I've been with my partner since I was 15 and the shit she's put up with is unmatched. Tysin is a true champion throughout mind and soul. May God bless you for this weekend 🙏  I hope you receive the blessings you deserve and stay on this path your on & I wish the same for myself! What a man, I hope this interview helps those who go through similar issues and remember your never alone even if you feel that way! Credit to neville also I think you have found a winning role 👍 Good luck tyson bless you & your family
I wish Fury should do more training and less talk cos wilder is angry and is not talking much! He is  loaded with vengeance!
Yeah that dark place
I’ve never heard him speak before but I learned so much. Thank you from Oklahoma
Best video yet
Fury is a great lad and so clever! Also, Gary is doing an amazing job!
He's already a legend, and he hasn't even finished.
Would be cool to see Fury vs Uysk
wonderful kp praying TYSON AINT GOD GREAT
Neville's always talking about authorities. He's a liar and a hypocrite
Legend 🇮🇪🇮🇪
I could live in a council flat over there. I don't need to live in a flashy house to get someone to like me. If they don't like me fuck em"  -Tyson Fury 2021
what an absolute legend Fury is 🙌🏻
Very honest interview top bloke
Love Tyson Fury’s shoes in this interview ❤️
Legend
https://youtu.be/KmgWqI_pMhc
Tyson Fury is a proper Bloke living in a woke World.🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 No Adverts for Lucozade or Lynx etc.!!
The way this legend explains his struggles is pure brilliant. To come from where he was to he is now is an ispiration to anyone going through the same struggles. Proving anything you put your mind to IS possible!
Brilliant interview just shows you can come through any challenge in life 👊🏻
manifest the good and share the bad..but people do the opposite and get lost in their own mind.
Forget Tyson’s class boxing ability  Above all he’s a top bloke
He can’t be so selfish....But his wife can! 😱😱😱  He clearly stated if his wife’s not happy that he will be terrorised! 😱😱😱
i love this guy. a true champion mindset.
Tyson is a very honest likable person.  I hope I meet him in person someday.
The only boxer in history I can relate to
Tyson looks strong 💪
Tyson would munch josua for breakfast.. And wilder.. We love you fury
I rate fury more than any other he fights the best
"High profile boxers can surely bring 'this system' down and have one rank" Gary Neville has no clue how boxing works at all and it's painful to listen to. The boxing organisations are separate organisations, you can't just have 'one rank' and you can't force boxers to fight each other. Whereas a football team is owned by shareholders, boxers own their own career they choose what risks to take and it's a lot more dangerous than football so it needs to stay that way.   The "Boxing World Cup" idea wouldn't be possible either, most top fighters already have the PPV star profiles so something like a Super Series/World Cup wouldn't benefit them and you can't force them into it. If there was a mandatory boxing contest you'd be risking your health fighting more people than you need to and you'd have less control over your own career which is terrible for boxers. Boxing is a dangerous sport it's not like football, so when you reach the top level you want to become a prize fighter and not risk your health.  A lot of these terrible ideas are hard to listen to, but I guess he is a boxing layman so you wouldn't expect him to understand how things work, but it's all just so wrong.
amazing guys
Tyson Fury is the best heavyweight on the planet - no doubt. Usyk is fantastic, but Fury is too skilled for a man of his size and speed for Usyk to get to him.
Legend.
Beside Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson,this lad,with same name of another Great box champ of all time, one and only,  Mike Tyson, TYSON FURY have a intelligence,street wisdom,life expirience(enought for 10 lifetime, or more),he also have a good soul,big and good heart,he is a honest to the bone,FURY is probably a very good friend,good mate,good father and what is more important Tyson Fury doesnt acting,he is what he is,not a liar,he not acting and pretending or copy someone else.He is a real champ,beacose only thruth champion can survive what he survive,and like a Phoenix, HE are born again,from the dust,from the bottom and start all over again,reset him self and another time came from the dirt to the star,but remaine the same ,NeXT door  regular and normal lad,what he is really is,and once again, from nothing,became something.Only a real champ can do,what T.Fury are doing,for all this and more,his place its next to another great heavy weight boxing  champs of the world ,M.Tyson and M.Ali.The greatest heavy weight boxer in this, present time,and in last 10/15 years,ladys and gents one and only"The Gipsy King"- TYSON FURY👍👍💪👊🤛🥊🥊!!!!
So no one is going to talk about his crazy t shirt of all the heavyweight boxers? That image looks mad.
What a guy 👍
What a great man tyson fury is......
I never liked him but to be honest he is one of the best boxer of his era and he is so ahead of everyone else right now.
Neville is exactly like what Fury is saying….all about the money, always trying to become a billionaire.
You gotta like this bloke. He's a great storyteller. I don't recon Klitschko was in his prime.
Hero
Tyson fury humble good soul goat lufc
Very enjoyable watching, keep up the good work 🙌🏻 Tyson is the boy
No man can beat Tyson Fury but they can try good luck to them
Tyson Fury interviews are inspirational life coach videos.
You are real inspiration mate
A free LIFE LESSON.                That’s all I can say. Thank you Fury.                 Be blessed
10:23 I believe Fury. Joshua will never take the fight, because despite the payday, his stock would fall after the inevitable loss.
This is the best interview to understand Tyson Fury , he comes off very well here , I haven't been his biggest fan
Top stuff Gary..great interview…Tyson so inspiring
Love how they are just walking around Morecombe.
One thing with Tyson is he doesn't bull $hit and he tells it how it is.
Brilliant ..
Up most respect to him…
How can anybody not love Tyson Fury, What a great man ...🥊
FANTASTIC INTERVIEW!!!
Hell of a video, nice one
Tyson inspiration and a legend
Good vid , good job all around but just one thing...  WTF is stone??  You gotta translate that weird shit into pounds.
I really want to see this man fighting Usyk....
Enjoyed that what an incredible mindset he has to come back
Fury's legs are X shaped. Man, he'll have problems in years to come...
No wonder he could box like Ali
Nice mention of Preston...😀👊
great vid
Anyone else shocked how nice Morecambe looks? Little hidden gem there
what a honest individuall , says it how it is , a true warrior,
great interview
That was fantastic! 👍
the most don to earth person ever. millions of men have this same problem.his representing us ll.literally feel like he speaks my life.inspriation.
To the 650+ people who gave a thumbs down to this video I want to wish you all the very best of luck with the journey that you are on.....
Sorry, everybody, for such a basic statement, but ... such a good interview.
His life is an Inspiration to live  From suicide to the heavy weight king!
Can't help but love the guy.
This was really tremendous.  What a man.  He is what's good about sports.
fury r5 stoppage,,
"He don't answer the phone to me no more" 😔 poor Tyson.
Fury is a legend hands down he will be spoken about in boxing for years and years
I'm just going to echo so many of the comments. My opinion of Tyson Fury has completely changed. A good man and a great interview 👍
Everyone says AJ is the golden boy of boxing, Britain’s pride of joy absolute bollocks, it’s this guy
Gary Neville is not very good at this job
*That kind of Anxiety is debilitating*
Brilliant.
Studies have shown that happiness increases as you earn more, but only up to around £50-55k. Once you continue to earn more over that amount then the correlation disappears.
Love that man. 👑
I’ve had an anxiety attack and believe me it’s the worse feeling ever.  I haven’t had one for 18 months now. It’s exactly how Tyson described it.
Fantastic interview Tysons a Legend.
Great video Neville and Tyson your a straight talking man no BS and tell it like it truly is . God Bless you always
Tyson fury is an inspiration to all those people like myself who suffer from depression and horrendous anxiety.  He gives you hope that one day you can beat it if you try 🙏💕
wow what an incredible gift. bet you Gary hates it 😂😂😂
I like Tyson Fury. The guy has amazing boxing talent and is also very down to earth with no big ego. Seems like a man who is happy in his skin and grateful for everything he has.
I know a certain Ukrainian who most definitely isn't a businessman
The down-to-earth side of him is really nice. He has a good heart and is hilarious when he wants to be.
brilliant interview, inspiring.
IM NOT A FAN OF NOBODY BUT JESUS CHRIST! THAT BEING SAID, TYSON! I JUST BECAME AN ADMIRER OF YOURS! BC I SEE JESUS IN YOU, THE STRENGTH THAT IT TOOK FOR YOU TO DO WHAT YOU DID CAN ONLY BE FROM HIM...AND YOU HAVE HIM  INSIDE YOUR HEART! IM A 40 YR OLD MAN, I GAVE UP MY LIFE TO TAKE CARE OF MY BROTHER, WHOS BIPOLLAR AMONG OTHER THINGS,,,NO WIFE, NO KIDS, AND ITS NOT BC IM WEIRD I ALWAYS HAD ANY WOMAN AND ANYTHING I ALWAYS WANTED, MY BROTHER, THE SAME, UNTIL THIS DEMON, GOT HOLD OF HIM...SO, LIKE YOU I FIGHT EVERYDAY, A BATTLE THATS NOT MINE! AND ITS THE TOUGHEST APPONENT I EVER FACED! I LOSE 10 TIMES A DAY! BUT WHEN I PUT MY HEAD ON MY PILLOW AT NIGHT, I KNOW I WON! BC I PROMISED BOTH MY MOTHER AND FATHER BEFORE THEY WENT HOME! ILL NEVER GIVE UP ON MY BROTHER, AND IM GONNA KEEP FIGHTING!...... TYSON, IF YOU EVER READ THIS! I KNOW THAT TERROR YOUR TALKING ABOUT, MY BROTHER CANT FIGHT IT NO MORE, SO I DO EVERYDAY, THANKS TO GOD FOR THE STRENGTH! YOU WENT THROUGH WILDER AND TOOK HIS BEST SHOTS, BC YOU JUST DEFEATED YOUR BIGGEST APPONENT, AN OPPONENT WILDER MAY HAVE RAN FROM! AND YOU CRUSHED IT! NOT MANY PPL WILL UNDERSTAND HOW DEVASTATING IT IS, BUT I DO! AND IM PROUD OF YOU!  ID BE DEVASTATED IF I EVER HEARD OR READ THAT YOU GIVEN UP! I KNOW YOU WONT! JUST KEEP FLOATIN, AND STINGIN, RUMBLE YOUNG MAN RUMBLE! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT IF YOUR EVER IN BROOKLYN, YOU HAVE A SEAT AT MY TABLE, WITH LOADS OF SICILIAN FOOD KEEP ROCKIN CHAMP!!
Im not a big boxing fan, but you can't not respect Tyson Fury for his honesty. He's genuinely the people's champion 🏆
That's why Fury's the Best pound for pound heavyweight champion. Fury became champ after beating KALISCO brother for the title then retired came back years later and beat Beyonce Wilder for his titles and is still undefeated, much respect. First elusive big man in a sport BOXING, Love you Man WHIP THAT DAWSON INTO RETIREMENT THIS TIME. SO HE CAN SPEND HIS TIME MASTERING THE TWERKING DANCE.
Awesome
I can’t stand Tyson fury when he’s bad mouthing AJ….and minimising his achievements ….but when he’s like this…..he’s fantastic….and a great ambassador of the sport….I love to listen to his stories…..the truth….great interview Gary Neville…👌👍❤️🥊
Tyson is a good brother in Christ. Gives anyone the time of day, even just to hear you talk. God bless the Fury’s.
Gary Neville looks like frank Ribery in this lol
Peep the guy at 31:27 clearly using his Mrs to get a pic of Tyson and Gary
What a story what a guy what a legend Tyson fury boxing needs you now aj lost the belts again it’s all on you to bring em all back home where they belong with you I followed you from fight one and will continue and when you do retire boxing will have a huge void
Tyson is a likable guy I like his honesty on being fucked on drugs and alcohol and then still being top of the game...Nice one 👍@ Neville great interview top of your game 👍
love both these guys !
What a legend. True faith. Honest guy. Fantastic. And Gary's a good egg too aha
Legend glory to God
“Just coz he is ripped and in good shape and I’m jealous” fucking hilarious
Gary gave Tyson the Picture of eric, but what i wanna know is : did tyson give gary a pair of them shoes🤔
Love this interview, very honest and funny too.  Come on Tyson for the last 3 fights, knock them out and be happy.
Really nobody better than Neville?
I have gone from a hater to a fan of this man, honest, modest and inspirational, keep it up lad X
Now AJ has been beaten by Usyk... Tyson should fight him instead
I bet Fury is going to destroy Wylder
Great interview I didn’t really know much about Tyson before so really enjoyed this interview well done both.
Brilliant. Tyson is a man's man. What a character.  God bless him
Wonderful to hear a man like that talk about his weaknesses, his dark moments. And about that day he just saw what he was doing...and snapped out of it.  It really touched me. Thanks so much.
They need to make a movie about fury when he retires.. amazing story
How can you not respect this man how??
That sea air in Morecambe has done him the power of good. Fury is such a breath of fresh air.
Mental health is a real struggle, even when you come out the other side it's hard work and you can find yourself slipping back in because being depressed is easy and in a weird way comforting. So you have to always work to keep your head above water. People talk a lot of shit about mental health and you can tell they don't "get" that darkness. I'm happy for them, I wouldn't wish it on anyone, but then they come out with stupid statements basically discrediting the battle people to through.  Not enough people can go, "well I don't get it but it sounds really tough and I'll have to take your word on it" It's always "you need to sort yourself out" "man up" "I wouldn't do that"  This was a great interview. I really dislike Fury when he's being the showman but moments like this when he's let his guard down and does the real talk I really warm to him.
Great interview
Hail the gypsy King!
The real hero.... Deontay wilder 😂
Good job
Brilliant enjoyed it
This Mutha ........is high as hell.
Brilliant interview
Who ever doubted Tyson 🤏
Growing up a kid building tree houses , smashing things up lol
I have to honestly admit when tyson first came around I couldn't stand the bloke I really couldn't,  now I realise what a genuine down to earth guy he is.  A real person , top bloke , im now a huge fan . Come on tyson I wish you the best of luck against wilder in your next fight , please beat him for us 👍
Fury uysk. Wilder aj🤷🏽‍♂️
I am so happy this man is in boxing and the number 1. Boxing was going down the pan until Tyson Fury became this honest, good person who speaks the truth and has no nastiness, immature ego. I never thought I would see decent, straight talking people with humility such as Tyson - in sport. He will always get my support.
Fury is brilliant. He is showing integrity by dumping a;; the nasty crap talk.
13:30 - 13:55  What Tyson said here is so true and you can just imagine the the money men at matchroom calculating exactly what joshua could get fighting 3 or 4 other small name fighters instead of Fury.  It would be a massive shame if him and Joshua don't end up sharing a ring. Knowing the money will be too good to avoiding, it will probably happen 5 years too late like Pacquiao and Mayweather.
Would love Jordan Peterson and Tyson Fury to have a chat
Amazing human this man is
2:50  Tyson's marriage in 20 seconds
hard not to like tyson fury
Mad that ten years ago I hated both these men and now I love listening to the pair of them. Bet there are loads of people who felt the same. Both legends.
Gary giving it the "hard man walk" with those wide swinging arms. Must be trying to match up to tyson 🤣 jokes btw
Genuinely the best sports interview I've ever seen.  Rarely is anyone as honest as Fury.
" In a wetherspoons in Morecambe - On me own" 🤣
Tyson fury is the biggest coward in boxing with 2 good names to his resume not one single title defence to his name. This man is an embarrassment to UK boxing as is his idiotic delusional fans but what do you expect given how woke fury fans are. Cowards will follow cowards.
When Fury talks like this you realise what a good man he is. He’s been through troubles snd come out the other side with character and integrity.  Top man
Love you tyson fury always fighting boxers in there prime and kind hearted man good luck big man for oct 9
Awesome interview
I love Tyson Fury ! Literally the baddest man on the planet in the ring but humble enough to openly talk about his weaknesses and vulnerabilities! He has the skill and is a showman but he also backs it all up in the ring ! In 50 years time nobody will even remember Joshua because this is Fury’s generation!
I love how he's so straight talking.... I hope he gets out while he's one top and doesn't get long term damage....
Done so many crazy things over the years ... Dresses up as batman.....🥺
Fury your a legend and a great entertainer! Best wishes
Tyson you can't say money is no factor at all.  Yes money should not be the end all, be all as you mentioned, but if there were no incentives in boxing, those so called heavy weight targets you mentioned like Klitschko would not exist as a competitor at all, and the sport would not have that kind of popularity and following that becomes a sustaining industry.  One in which you are enticed to compete in due to your passion for the art.   So money does play apart and some athletes or most are looking at the sport as a means of transaction.   If you face the pressure of paying bills and sustaining a family and your own needs, that is where you will realize that finances are precious to many out there and should not be played down.
The system they need is what the UFC has. There is one guy in charge and the best always fight the best in their primes. Unfortunately, there is no way that will happen. It's so dumb to have that many governing bodies with their own belts. They need to unify them and have 1 organization.
Totally admire Fury and his amazing comeback and his skill and mental strength in and out the ring!! But really has he got a better resume than AJ?considering AJs lack of amateur career? Fury has fought 2 top heavyweights in 6 years, that’s not the measure of a great fighter. AJ has never made excuses for his losses, hes always taken them well. Let’s see how Fury takes his first loss to Wilder next weekend!!
Great interview, how can anyone not like this Fury. 18:23 He reminds of Lewis Hamilton in the way they can both honestly praise their opponents, no ego, just an observer admiring someone's good points.
Boxer or not a Boxer? , what I mean is if Fury was a car park attendant you'd like him, win or lose in boxing you'd like him . In Morecambe he is a dad and a husband and a down to earth human being.  I like that he enjoys his surroundings and has come through depression and made a good life for himself , his wife Paris and his kids. I am sure he drinks Carling Black Label. He is a dambuster and also a shining light in the dark world of boxing , all power to your elbow Gypsy King!
I love this dude man!
Tyson Fury is absolutely gold, much love and respect; and his talks are important for at least me to listen to. Tyson and Jo Rohan is a must also. Cheers The Overlap.
Somewhere in Morecombe there's a clown missing his shoes 😂
Hi my name is Jeffery from Blackpool I live in a tent in the back of a van and struggling but please remember your wealth is your health not money in the back and wat tison sed about money is right money dosent make you happy please be lucky I'd like to show tison he can win
What a guy, my opinion of him has flipped on hits head completely these last few years. Just a normal guy battling issues like everyone else. Lesson for everyone out there suffering. Find something to keep you going 💪
Have to love this guy!
Tyson is the most honest nicest guy, I wish him happiness and success 🥊❤
Pair of doorknobs
What a nice genuine guy Fury seems unlike many other professional boxer and good work by Gary!!
What's gan on with them bobby dazzler's Tyson? XD
Tyson has explained depression perfectly .. All credit to him to come out and talk about it .... Depression was certainly one of the hardest things I have ever had to deal with in my life ..
This guy is brutally honest
what separates him from other fighters is the intrinsic vs extrinsic value
IDK how anyone could dislike this guy. Respect from the U.S.
Real man, Tyson good job, baddest man in the world 💯
Apart from being a nice person (man), this fellow is role model for mental health issues and life lessons! Big thanks to Gary and Tyson for such an open and honest interview!  All the best going forward to you Tyson Fury, your a legend of legends, Gbless
Top notch! First thing I’ve bothered to watch all the way to the end for years👏👏
I love this man . A true legend
I used to like Tyson a lot, after watching this video I realise now that I love him a lot , stay strong champ x
Always thought Neville comes  across as a bit naff but not now. Fantastic interview.
Great interview
Fury talks so much bullshit he thinks it's reality.
The Gentleman Boxer.
Brilliant interview. Though, to say I live in the moment, I don't look back to the past, then say I would like to master the art of time travel had me 😂
'Man up ... get on with it'' ... Tyson got on with it.
What a guy Fury is. Love him - what a legend. Honest, down to earth and a brilliant fighter! keep it up champ.
TYSON we love you 😍 ❤
Love Tyson I don’t think Joshua fight will ever happen now especially that Joshua just lost again
Great interview!
Love how grounded tyson still is x
80m bull shit!
Great fighter, love him to bit's, hope he smashes wilder into kingdom come.
Brilliant interview
Amazing 👏
If you don't like this guy then you've definitely got a problem.
Genuine good honest man and the best fighter out there at heavy weight.  💪
What an amazing interview
a bit changed now, didn't it 😂
Top bloke Tyson and what a top guy Gary Neville is aswell.
I love tyson fury 🤣🤣🤣👏🔥
Wow he’s all over the place with his answers almost to the point of contradicting himself
Fuck AJ, Fury vs Usyk!!! Book it!!
Big up to Tyson Fury 👏🏾💪🏾😤
OG. Love this interview.
cameraman must be half goldfish     every 20 seconds staring at the shiny shoes lol      but awesome interview  and stories!
Halfway through I started realizing how awkward the walking and talking is
Good, honest, open interview. It's like when you watch a mountaineering film (or when I watch a mountaineering film) - you don't want techno overdubs, you don't want effects filters - you want to listen to the mountain. Likewise this interview: the mountain in its natural setting.
Fury used to call AJ at like 3-4am randomly, and as soon as AJ would answer, Fury would shout "im gonna knock you out!" - then hang then phone up LOL
Gary nevillie's package in those jeans 😄 🤣
Such a humble, down to earth guy.
I am so glad you came along-You tell the truth and whether it is about you or someone else-it is so refreshing I can see that others are affected by it also
Oh yeah, by the way-Anthony Joshua would not stand a ice cube in Hell chance fighting you
Tyson you are the best heavyweight-go out and beat this guy down worse than the 2nd fight!!!
Who put carpets under nevilles arms ha ha
Top Bloke is Tyson.
Most anxiety stems from a conflict between the mind and the soul. The soul must win.
As always, quality interview! I love that Tyson's not afraid to talk about how he's feeling and discuss mental health. Top bloke
I confess i always thought dont ask me why this guy was a complete n.b maybe its because I am but seeing this interview has totally changed my mind what a guy he is and from now on I will never judge anyone ever what a real man you are tyson big up 2 you big man
Will the Neville curse continue?
He looks in damn good shape.
I could never understand Fury...awkward boxing style...but finally I grew to respect him...he is a humble guy, great guy....and he has a natural ability to box like very few.He will beat Wilder in first 4 to 5 rounds guarenteed.
I suffer a bit from massively overthinking things where by something will pop into my head and I'll still be thinking of the same thing for days...then another thing will pop into my head and the process starts again the same thought pattern over and over..but Tyson is my inspiration so is everyone else's who is suffering with something but we carry on in the hope better days will come hang in there folks..
What an excellent interview by Gary Neville and Tyson is excellent as he always is.
Much Respect Mr. Fury!!! 💯💯💯
Love Tyson Fury. He has grown on me massively over the years and so glad you've got him on here. Can you do Ronnie O'Sullivan please?
Excellent video...Tyson came over as a really down to earth guy.
The tough fights in the ring and all the entertainment he has given, made a top fighter. When he talks openly about mental health, that is when he became a great man.
Fury made me feel comfortable talking about my own mental health issues. Listening to him here is like listening to someone talk about me. The sleeping with the light on, pure terror, drinking and low mood, infecting others with negativity. Made a full recovery myself now and cannot tell you how much I resonate with this man. I love him and he’s a credit to himself and the sport for what he’s got himself back from.
Amazing- these interviews are so entertaining
I have so much empathy for this man our lives were opposite except for mental illness. I understand your troubles I've been to the dark places please keep motivated as you are helping me and I imagine so many others.
What a legend. Fury is 100% the genuine article. Alot to take away from that interview. Nice one Gary.  Fury for mayor of Morecombe what you think?
His strength of character is incredible and to see him open up is inspirational, I think we can learn more from people like Tyson and Ricky Hatton than anybody, they’ve walked it and talked it and lived to tell the tale. That was sensational, well done.
Gary is a fantastic interviewer. He really is brilliant. As for Tyson, well he is the closest to normal as a superstar could ever be. No airs, no graces, simply just a simple man doing great things and staying grounded.
I FUCKIN LOVE FURY!!! pardon my french but its just quintessential north west england talk ahahah big up north west UK blaaaaaapppp!!!!
It's a good show, this. Great idea and very focused. Refreshing in a world when everything is made political or socio-political. It's informed, Gary obviously has real credibility in sports and his questions are excellent. And obviously the beautiful scenery.
Difficult to find a bad word to say about Fury, great bloke.
I really like Fury he's grounded and simple.
Tyson fury the champ ✌👍
Brilliant interview
An absolute hero. Still doesn't get close to the recognition he deserves.
Tyson Fury doing wonders for Morecambe's tourism "I call it Alcatraz..............last point of civilisation for me............I like to be in a place where there is nothing much to do"
One of the realest people you could ever meet.  What a great interview!
Just superb refreshing honest and open.Look at this giant of a man born and bred to fight a genuine hard man Champion Heavy Weight Boxer.Mental illness anxiety mental breakdown,s can strike anyone at anytime.Its how you deal with it.Tyson,s story is inspirational he,s struggled over come and identified his demons.This is one of Neville,s best interviews with out a doubt.Best wishes to all stay safe stay healthy talk to people catch-up with family friends.Tony
What a fucking bloke. Legend.
100% truth with everything he says. Joshua is a business man, you don’t see fury in adverts and advertising his own products 100% focused on boxing and nothing else
Gary's doing amazing as an interviewer
Fury is the true peoples champion
Gotta love the Gypsy King!
Those shoes though, can’t take the gypsy out of the gypsy king
I like fury’s honesty about wilder
A heavyweight Champ...thats a man...full of testosteron...not like the race baiting rainbow warrior...AJ.....if he ever gets that gay AJ in the ring....they will take AJ out with an ambulance...
They needs to be a film made of him
https://youtu.be/X0xJdguHHPk
After Saturday AJ WILL WONT HIS REMATCH  WITH USYK .SO THAY MIGHT NEVER FIGHT I CAN NOT SEE AJ GETTING ANYWERE NEAR TYSON
You can’t help but love Tyson Fury.
A delusional person like Wilder that can not accept a honest defeat deserves to be put into intensive care station
tyson seems like a proper nice dude
People just need to stop getting interviewed by Gary Neville. Harry Kane has turned to shit and now Joshua loses to Usyk. Seriously worried Fury is going to lose now.
Happiness is the struggle, Tyson. That's where all your fondest memories are. Keep struggling with the people you love.
Great interview, that. I’ve suffered horrendous anxiety attacks in recent years, and Tyson explains it succinctly. Good luck to him, he’s a genuine bloke.
Fury the fraud full of crap and ‘Joshua’s never fought anyone in there prime’, he’s fought  more boxers in the top 10 his last 7 or 8 fights then he has in his full career, this is coming from a none Joshua fan don’t like him much but the record speaks for it’s self. Fury needs to try defend his titles a few times it’s fucking embarrassing he’s hasn’t.
Loved it. Brilliant from both
Absolutely Brilliant interview. Hats off to Nev,  asked some excellent questions & a natural but Fury is a Legend. I know people that have met him after having a dinner plus an audience with Fury & every one of them said he was a true gent & a very genuine bloke. No ego whatsoever.
I like how they walking on the beach
I love Tyson Fury’s determination and confidence in boxing. He’ was downright straight about all his struggles with mental health, great guy indeed. He is in another class far above all his contenders in boxing. Glad he mentioned that he learned all from the greatest boxer of all times. Kudos to you son.
Good interview Gary you make me different positive sides off fury. Is about time fury start fighting and stop talking no doubt he’s a skill full fighter and no how to pick a fight but he only fight wilder and clitchko  we need to see you fight more serious fighter than that
One of the reasons you should never wear skinny jeans is because they make you walk funny.
Love this man. Honest down earth to the point genuine bloke and he's the only reason I watch boxing,an all round entertainer and the best boxer.
Bless this man🙏🙏🙏🙏
Man, I wish I knew what they're talking about :/
LOVE TYSON 😘😘
I COULD LISTON TO HIM ALL DAY
Wow, what an interview. Absolutely loved it. Big respect to Tyson for opening up. I love this channel.
I myself considered suicide on boxing day after stress overload and day in police cell Dec 2019 .. hearing Tyson again with his condition , only music and exercise helped me through my #mentalhealth issues severe depression .. god bless you mate 🥊 Gary great programme fella
TYSON FURY BEST HEAVY WEIGHT TO HAVE LIVED
Tyson is as real as they come... No beating around the bush... Just simply honest. Such an inspiration.
Quite a present he gave Tyson given that Keano only got some doggy treats! Maybe that picture was just gathering dust in the attic, stange painting!
I really like Gary. Why is he with sky?
Love fury
He’s very inspirational to me - what a guy! Humble and selfless. Amazing! Great interview Gary! Extra respect to Gary for such a great positive human interview!
Tyson Fury is a living legend💪🏻💪🏻
We not gonna talk about Fury's SHIRT?
Usyk is out there waiting for you
What a guy.
Love Tyson fury! All the best mate👍🏻
Can Tyson Fury beat Usyk?
Totally inspiring 👍 Tyson, you are a legend 👍
That was nice of Gary to give him that gift, it suits Tyson to the ground.
Why would you negotiate the Joshua fight while you knew that there was a court case you might lose? When you lost the case why didn't you reach to Eddie and try and find a solution, for example sign a new contract with Wilder where he would fight the winner of your fight with Joshua? Tyson is my favourite boxer but he handled this situation terribly.
This man is a living legend 100 percent
stay away from gary neville tyson you'll ruin your transfer
Names him after a boxer then says.."don't get into boxing.!" Makes perfect sense. 👌
It isn't really possible to whip up excitement for this totally unnecessary third fight with Wilder.
Remarkably, the judges last night scored Joshua's loss to Usyk accurately and honestly, taking a great deal of the shine off a potential Fury-Joshua fight.
so cool love this guy
Top bloke
All Glory to Jesus!!
I love fury  Such an open genuine chap
TYSON IS THE MAN BLESS YOU 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🙏🏻 WE ARE NOT WORTHY 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Very good interview. Really enjoyed it. Tyson seems to be very down to earth and very real.
His explanation of his drinking habits/issues are so close to my own, it’s weird. It’s precisely why I just had to stop entirely. I’d be far too ‘in the moment’, forget about obligations or the fact I even had a home to go to, and end up going to as many bars as possible, making sure I bought multiple bottles of spirit from an off-license so I had drink for when the bars closed, and doing anything to keep a gathering around me to continue drinking around London’s streets (or doing it alone if everyone else went home).
I can relate to this man so much happiness is the hardest thing to find
Imagine if Tyson Fury found Islam. May Allah guide you to Islam
More than a boxing interview. This was a life interview. Good luck to the Gypsy King
This man is the best boxer I’ve ever seen
Andre The Giant drank 108 pints once. Big burping giant dosser.
Nice sukies
Fury has a reach of about 8 or 9 inches longer than Usyk, about 3 stone heavier and 5 inches taller, he moves just as slick as Usyk and has as big a heart if not bigger. Fury could beat him by switching to southpaw and confusing Usyk as he hasn't faced many who could do this so would feel discombobulated to a clear points win. He could beat him by jabbing at a safe distance and Usyk's eyes would both close up so he couldnt see by round 8 (TKO). He could lean on him and smother him physically and mentally and beat him that way, or he could go Krunk style and batter him for a knockout but that would be 4th choice. Fury would ruin Usyk, and would make Joshua look like what he was in 10 years ago, an amateur. Wilder would beat both too. Fury is by far and away the best heavyweight in this era and in the top 5 of all time, no question. Anyone who says he isn't, allloorrrra, simply doesn't understand the sweet science of boxing.
this guy is one punch man irl, unbeatable
👍🇫🇮
Now that AJ has lost, I think people will listen to Furys words a little closer this time.
I just love Tyson fury
It not about money fight for free then
Gray is very savvy and a good listener, that's why this series works, lovely interviewer. Wonder if the Gipsy King would fancy a fight v Usyk after last night?
Based on the fight last night with USYK, everything Tyson says has even more credibility and truth x
ONE OF THE MOST GRIPPING INTERVIEWS IV EVER SEEN I HOPE EITHER TYSON OR GARY SEES THIS COMMENT COS THIS REALY WAS AMAZING VIEWING
These interviews are really good watch them all the way through everytime
Such a lovely down to earth man. A great family man too.
PROB ONE OF THE MOST DOWN TO EARTH INTERVIEWS IV EVER SEEN ABSOLUTELY  LOVED IT GREAT VIEW TYSON FURY GREAT GUY
He is a big intimidating guy 😳
Ahahahaha this aged well. I called Usyk winning this fight a month ago and expect Fury to beat Wilder again for the same reasons we just saw last night. And he beats AJ all day too. Fury and Usyk have real experience and are the finished article whereas AJ and Wilder are still learning on the job. It's hype Vs hard work, power Vs skill and big money backing from the start of their campaigns Vs more modest becomings.
And ppm really think the racist juice head AJ can beat this guy!!! Fury will destroy him
best Tyson interview ever, thank you, both!
What a gift at the end.
The amount of times clips were repeated in this just annoyed me.
👍👍👍👍
Tyson is fucking awesome, I just want to sit and chat about the concept of time with him.
Why has Sky stolen GB News colours/banner
Absolutely fascinating watch for anyone remotely interested in sport. Tyson’s comeback has to be the greatest in sporting history… HEaring Tyson speak about why he wants to fight, absolute elite mentality - does it to be the best and he is the best.
Aj on about getting his notebook out after he bottled it to a no one again  Should just watch this
Does Tyson have a personality disorder or something? I cannot figure out who the real Fury is?
Who have you fought in their prime? Who are the big names? Wilder who has not fought anyone special? Got seen as someone who cannot box by Ortiz...it was just a matter of time wilder got seen for what he is.  You fought Klitchko when he was 39, and then you called yourself lenial champion like it means something...  AJ has fought much better opponents than you. You fought a few bums in your comeback and riding on your fights with Deontey Wilder who cannot box...  Tysons comeback...  Seferi = Bum Pianeta = Over his prime beaten by Johnson Schwarz - Who had he fought before? Wallin - You looked poor UD  .....  And then their was Wilder.  Great CV, of the best fighting the best. I would rate AJ's CV. Even though they were old, they were still dangerous and good fighters. AJ was still young and he was will to fight whoever was big enough.  Sorry Tyson you sound like an absolute muppet when you Diss other fighters, when let's face it you could be talking talking about yourself.
GYPSY KING BOSS END SWET 🥰🥰🥰🙏💪
Brilliant 😂.. Aj dont answer the phone to me no more -      fury ur som man... Respect
Great beaches there. But its a fact after usyk out boxs joshua that fury had joshua running from him........
What a great man, really hope he stays strong and lives a long happy life
after usyk fight tyson you are next
Tyson's greatest interview.
Tyson fought everyone in their prime? Wlad was in his prime at 39? Yet he accused AJ of fighting over the hill fighters when they were 39? Who else has Fury fought in their prime other than Wilder that turned out to be a massive fraud anyway?
The Gypsy king at his purest,,,love it,,,great conversation,,great channel
Great frickin interview. Not the biggest Fury fan but he is a likeable guy and to hear his struggles when you have everything and just his honesty makes this amazing to me.
Great job Gary! Tyson is inspirational
Well what a amazing interview 👏
Tyson is such a humble man and speaks from his heart. Such a authentic interview, loved every minute of it.
I love this guy!
Gypsy King looking lean and mean.... watch out world
How can you dislike this man. Speaks so much truth.
Tyson Fury called it: the Anthony Joshua fight is never happening because AJ is shite.
I totally get everything Tyson says about anxiety and depression I have exactly the same issues
Yet didn’t lose to wilder the first time because of a stupid technicality
Tyson is sadly clear 😂😂
BRILLANT Champion of the people good luck Tyson from france
I like Tyson,but i think AJ can knock him out
He is an inspiration to people with metel health boss interview that was spot on m8 lv it 😎
Lies and lies
I have anxiety and depression myself, and to see one of the world's biggests "hard men" talk about his experiences, so openly too, I respect him for it so much. Genuinely he's an inspiration.  I just hope when he retires, he doesn't have issues again, I know alot of other sports stars struggle with retirement. He also seems like a very genuine guy too.
When I lost my parents I was pretty down and had a few sad years drinking  on my own then just before covid my brother Paul who was my best mate died we had 54 years together.  It broke me and still hurts but I've done the ten stone weight drop like tyson .
Great guy who say's it how it is ! Perfect Enjoy Now!
Fought the best in their prime ? What a liar
WOW. Well done guys. A great interview. Tyson you are the real deal.
Tyson might have an excess production of naturally produced DMT in his pineal gland.
Can’t help but love this guy. People used to compare his trash talk and Conor’s, but the real difference is that Fury is honest with himself, even if it’s hard stuff to admit. He’s a true character WITH true character.
YeahJoshua is a big bum.
1 of my favorite boxers man.. It's Mike Tyson, Tyson Fury, & Canelo. 😈
Those shoes! :))))))))
Great guy with a great attitude..
How can you NOT like Tyson Fury? Pfoper geezer. Proper man's man. Likeable as f*ck is the Gypsy King!  We love Tyson
Fuck mate what is this 25 stones
I love how they kept cutting to Tyson's shoes
Fantastic interview with a very impressive man.
Heineken beste Bier, Tyson Fury beste Mann, der haut erst die verbrannte Pommes 🍟 aus dem Ring und danach hohlt er sich die ganze Krone 🤴 The great Gibsy King, 👍⚔️👍⚔️🍻
One of the greatest boxers & person of all time.
Best heavyweight boxer opens up about weaknesses. How refreshing. Top guy Tyson,  deserves everything positive that comes his way; happens to also be fkn hilarious
Used to be a big fan but the time for talking has stopped now. You can't rewrite history, it wasn't Joshua who lied to the world about the fight being signed the day before Wilder's arbitration hearing
He’s hard not to like big Tyson
Gotta Love him
Just fight AJ
the thing is, Gary Neville is a tall guy, very tall, but here, he looks like a kid brother
I need that shirt Fury is wearing looks fire
The reason I prefer Fury to Joshua is Joshua is what a boxer would be if a modern corporation could make a boxer, Fury is real.
This guy is just amazing... #teamfury 💙
Anyone notice Tyson's T-Shirt...his way of telling everyone who he will fight until he hangs it up!
I could listen to the gypsy king talk for hours. Very wise man.
He’s changed the story about his comeback so many times
Great interview and all that but why does gary neville walk like he's shat himself
hes acting like the arbitration case against him for the rematch came out of no where , he knew all about it was just holding the fight out and waiting till the contract expired to not have the 3rd fight w wilder
hes a known cheater
Reminds me of myself with the metal health and Anxiety attacks I had same thing but since training 6days a week I am so much more better of if I didn’t have training I wouldn’t be in a good place I’ve came from hell so o can relate big up fury 👊
Nice!! Need to work that jab more but keep it up guys!!
Amentyson god bless you and all your family.....you a true gentleman
Exactly no one noes the working of the MIND
The peoples champion
“He never thought the fight would happen” but he announced it himself…. Lol.
loool 13:14 Fury said they've been trying to do this fight (against AJ) since he was 22, 11 years ago but AJ's first match was 8 years ago lol
Up Tyson fury
Tyson needs to stop this "I'm more humble than the other guy narrative". If you're happy living a basic life, why are you getting your head bashed for millions of dollars??? Or do you make this money and let it seat in the bank and depreciate? Please you are all businessmen. Stop the cap!!
As much as I like Fury, dont believe half of what he says.
Fantastic interview
Brilliant interview, I love watching Tyson fight, all the best in your next bout.
Tyson chat shit fury if u had a re match with wilder why gas your fans up about fighting AJ
Literally 5 lies told in this video with evidence this bloke is full of bs.... How are the ticket sales doing for the fight anyway?
The reason is for Eddie hearn mentioning tyson furys and trying to put the weightlifting mug alongside the king of the boxing world's name is get the media and the boxing world talking about it getting a little bit of fame fame off the real heavyweight champion of the boxing world tyson fury no1 and a UK paper chumpion aj old person beater upper right back getting talked about again there is still a stink from aj and management left after the USA fighter's said there was no heavyweight fighter's in the UK any good then the real heavyweight champion of the boxing world went over and bitch slapped there best for mouthing off aj and he's management went into a sileant mode of shock of what happened over in America what the real heavyweight champion of the boxing world did to the man aj was so scared of wilder now him and wilder is in the same boat both of them is no good to the real heavyweight champion of the boxing world tyson to fast fury no1 simple the best in the world boom 😀 👌 👑 👑 👑
I am shocked at how good Gary is as an interviewer, good job
I love Tyson Fury But it does piss me off when he goes on about Joshua not wanting to fight him if you put both of there careers I would say Joshua's resamay of fighter's are better than Furys I want all the Bullshit to be over and get the fight we all want to see Undisputed between Joshua and Fury there both British there both in there prime so after Joshua BEATS Usyk and Fury BEATS Wilder the 3rd time ding ding the BIGGEST FIGHT in British fight History is on I await the announcement of those words in the Future HELL AWAITS DARKNESS IS THE LIGHT
Anthony Joshua has the best resume of any current heavyweight.
40 minutes? felt like 5, great interview. Can't not love The Gypsy King!
Best interview ive watched. Unfiltered, honest and the amount of information Tyson has uncovered regarding his depression and anxiety is amazing for everyone. If someone who has the worlds at their hands being the best at their sport can feel like that, then never think you cant get back on your feet again.
must say, Fury is a legend
He still bitched out the fight against Joshua
Why does Gary Neville ONLY look like 2 inches shorter than Tyson Fury?? Is this an optical illusion or is Gary 8 foot fucking 12
There's only one Tyson Fury.
Gary could you invite Beckham to your show?
What a genuine nice guy…. Nice to hear such a superstar talk from his heart.  What a man
Guy is an inspiration. Like how he’s outspoken about his demons. I can relate, gives me motivation in achieving my goals.
has Fury been practicing his Kung Fu Art of The Drunken Master ? That shit so Funnie
Tyson is so awesome he has helped so many people around the world even myself I wish one day I could meet him and say thank you he really is a legend inside and outside of the way you have the best job in the world interviewing mate God bless him 🥊🙏🇱🇧
Why I stopped watching mma https://youtu.be/ODxACLV8U00
If this guy retires boxing will definitely be running on fumes
im 90 kilos and i drank 90 small beers once and didnt sleep for 3 days.
He didn't fight kiltch at his prime he did it when he was a lot older and shit
Love listening to Tyson. He’s honest, refreshing and a good role model. After overcoming depression and anxiety, no opponent fazes you.
Tysons just a local guy loves the sport and a big family man.  His core is solid and has his priorities straight knows where he stands in the world and appreciates alot that comes his way wat a guy wat a fighter 💛👍😇🙏💪 🥊
Lol at Tyson's shirt
35:15 keep searching Tyson, one day you'll find it and the world will seem right. Take time to reflect on the past and you'll see all the good things you've achieved.
It's so good that he talks about his depression.
I love this guy
I like Fury, but I think he is scared of him lool
Smh
Hope you had a test before and after
What ever you think Fury   is interesting to listen to and talks a lot of  common sense.
God Bless the Gypsy King 👑 🙌 Get em champ!!!!!🤜
Guys an enigma! I think he’s an intelligent articulate fella, most times…..he talks a lot of shit, but a lot of sense too. But nobody can deny his immense skills as a boxer & value for money as a comedian & entertainer! I for one love the guy :)
This bloke is a king - I’ve always rated him but the first Wilder fight took him and boxing to a new level that nobody could have expected - his character puts him in the same class as Ali albeit for different reasons - he will cream AJ when it happens
Tyson feels like a really honest man, a proper gentle giant!
Same old rubbish
Really nice interview. Obviously Tyson is a great interviewee due to his candour and mix of confidence, ego and vulnerability, but GNev has a very nice lightness of touch while still asking good questions
No other celebrity can be this honest. Tyson is talks like a man with nothing to lose. He lays it all out out.
Was a massive Fury fan but lost all respect for him after how he dealt with the Joshua fight. ‘I’m not in it for the money’, when he was demanding 50-50 and wanting £100mil. ‘I just want to fight’ but spent months being difficult about who’s name is first on the poster and who walks out first at the fight. A load of shite, and every time he gets called out by the fans he plays the mental health card. Eddie Hearn did all the chasing around, finding the venues etc, and Fury’s promotors are a waste of air.   Also saying he fights all these great boxers in their prime, and that AJ hasn’t. Look at AJ’s list, and the only one out of Fury’s (before Wilder) that’s impressive was Klitschko, who he’d fought only a year and a half before AJ at 40 years old, but goes on about how AJ fought him out of his prime. He just spouts complete shite, massive hypocrite
Love these words
8.27 mins.... love it xx
I love tyson such a genuine and real guy
Can you imagine anyone else answering those boxing questions with the knowledge and insight of this so-called big mouthed gypsy wannabe Champion? He's literally the most successful, technical, educated heavyweight of this current generation, and he won't be beaten by the likes of Wilder (round 3) or Joshua in the next fight. Well done Tyson, the best heavyweight boxer of the last 20 years.
Never like TF ubtill he made his comeback which I thought wud neve happen and was  a "PR STUNT"How wrong was i!!? To cine back firm where he was is a testament to who he is and the people he surrounds himself with. B4 he lost it all I thought he an utter prick but to go as "DARK" as he dis ti then come back from that "DARK" place get his Ass back into the ring and lose all that weight  WOW MAN I wish him all the best. Wilder getting sparked the fuck out
Enjoyable interview, worth seeing
What an outstanding individual.
Come on Fury 🤴🏻🏆
Goat interviewing a goat. Beats AJ hands tied behind his back
Fantastic interview. Open honest and so humble and a normal man, what a real inspiration especially to people going through dark times in life
Gary Neville is everywhere
Bloke talks complete shit doesn’t want to be a celebrity but he’s been in wwe and he ducked aj 100% and faked having covid to earn more money in the wilder fight bloke chats BS
"If i had him here id flatten him" ahahahah
You can ask tyson anything and he will answer honestly and with respect. Love that
Great interview get up there the Gypsy king 👑 and love to your family I lost a son Frankie he would have been 10 now but I have a second chance and I'm taking it thanks for the Inspiration to get back up for myself and my family God 🙏
Wow what a nice touch from Gary to give his own personal painting to Tyson. Good lad.
Nice man.. Not so nice in a ring.. 😂
The blokes a fucking melt
true, honest, genuine. hope he stays happy always
He's the salt of the earth that lad, top fighter and top bloke.
Never liked Gary Neville as a footballer, but as a pundit and now an interviewer, he does very well. His opinion against the setting up the Super League, his opinions about how the league should be run are substantive.
The guy who wrote the question "What single habit have you practiced most?" and got the answer boxing must have KICKED HIMSELF for not writing "(apart from boxing)" hahah though he did get the wanking joke so....
Same always tyson furys hands tied up in a contract to fight someone then Eddie hearn shoots he's mouth off with he's weightlifter aj the joke he is scared of the boxing king tyson fury and wilder a weightlifter bum the boxing world knows he is full of crap a big joke to the boxing world long live the boxing king tyson fury no1 simple the best in the world boom 😀 👌 👑
I was in the AJ camp.. my opinion has changed! Comes across as a great bloke,  true gent with no bullshit!
He's the baddest ass on this planet. But more importantly--his candid, honest attitude towards his mental health enables him to be a role model and a helpful voice for those enduring the same struggles. Hard to not like this guy, no matter who you root for in the sport.
Gary Neville should be ashamed of himself. his local town club has been destroyed and he couldn't even be bothered to raise awareness . we didn't want his money just some publicity. absolute traitor to Bury Football club, the town and his fathers memory. Thankfully some people did not give up on us like the Nevilles and we are now hoping to get Gigg Lane back and the club. If we are successful stay away Neville
Tyson Fury is one of those people that looks like a sack of shite no matter what he's wearing! 😂 Unfortunately I'm the same. 😂🤷🏻
youu cant hate this man
How is this guy "the peoples champion"? When did he last fight in the UK for his "people". Also don't understand how he has been given a pass for the AJ fight? Let's not forget he was the first person to say the fight was on! I used to love this guy now I know he is just full of shit
I’ve followed boxing since the 70s…and boxed in the late 70s too…this guy is the most under rated heavyweight in boxing history…..nobody in the heavyweight division moves like him ….a young Cassius clay was faster and moved well but he never feighted punches or swooped lefty to righty like him plus he’s way way way bigger than Ali …..love him ….
Keep these coming Gary - Quality interviews with proper sportsmen!
This man is a legend.
Tyson is the most human person living the most human experience. Can relate to so much he has to say. We all need a task and challenge. It’s natural. The whole time obsession is something I have had to let go of. It’s totally out of hands. We are at our best and fully satisfied when we aiming for some achievement in every day and excepting how perfect we all are.
15 seconds in... And i am done.  Lies from the beggining Fury is a pathological liar  Not to mention a drug cheat.
31:29 women having the worse photo ever with Tyson and Neville 😂
Use to dislike Fury, until he spoke about his life.  100% genuine guy.
i hate it when millionaires go on about money isn't everything. Try having nothing and see how happy you are. it's shit.
NOT PRETTY COOL , WHEN YOUTUBE CENSOR THE REAL ISSUES GOING ON WITH THE WORLD .
Pretty sure the Ref was going '6' by the time you woke up you big gobshite
The greatest heavyweight of this era.
The best of heavyweight of todays era no doubt about it .
Time is just a concept. Like Unicorns, or believing that Mathematics a language, is somehow your objective reality.
No to the Mind Virus, untested Chemical cocktails & perverted Politicians still breathing. Wtf up.
Nice Shoes 😎
Never liked Tysoe fury always thought he was arrogant melt who has had a lucky career but this has change my mind on him he's so down to earth and the way he speaks on mental health is great. I know he'll spark wilder out again and hopefully him and AJ can have couple epic fights cos apart from them heavyweight division is light.
That coffee doesnt spill?
Fantastic interviewer and interviewee
What an absolutely horrible picture to gift at the end. Here's some ugly old crap I never want to look at again. Yeah, thanks Gary.
I have to say this was a truly great interview Gary. Tyson really did prove this was the greatest ever sporting comeback there has ever been. He beat the best and one of, if not, the most powerful puncher in the world in the first fight, no doubt about it and this is after a torrid period as he describes. The second fight, he absolutely schooled him and I hope he does the same in the 3rd fight to put this to bed once and for all and lets get the fight everyone in the UK wants.   I like his openness and this really makes this interview for me.   Fantastic watch.
Who has he fought that was in there prime though?
@12:30 "Klitchko in his prime" LOL! You waited till he got older and wanted to retire and then challenged him
What a great conversation. Tyson is 100% himself. Big respect.
he said they don't want more children then makes the comment about paris being his mentor.....they will have been making a baby straight after she watched the interview
Got to be honest,I never could take to TF but seeing what he come through both mentally and physically I have to take my hat off to him
Such a down to earth bloke !
Tyson Fury has never defended a belt, beat a Klitschko in decline and with woeful personal problems at home, and won't have fought in nearly 2 years by the time the Wilder bout comes around.  I also love how he won't talk about the past, but will happily talk about his mental health and weight issues.  Let's talk failed a Nandrolone test, the collapse of the Klitschko rematch, and the fact that he was very lucky not to be stopped on cuts against Wallin.
How can you not love and admire TF. Brutally honest guy and he has a big heart.
It is just ME or does Nev NOT look all THAT small compared to this GIANT of a man? Like he doesn't LOOK MASSIVE over Nev and he SHOULD Carra DOES ffs!
Is this "walk interview" a G Nev meme thing or something? I mean it was FUNNY ONCE. the "hello darkness my old friend" with the LOVELY Kate Dalgleash. Did it with Harry Kane too. It just feels weird and put on. Just sit in a chair. Its easier to just listen to the answers without seagull shit and ting.
I am a city fan and I have to say I love Neville . These programs are so easy to watch. The Roy Keane was electric
Very good interview. Feels like the most honest yet. No bravado. No bullshit. Credit to Tyson AND Neville.
This is so honest and refreshing
I can relate to him so much. I’m glad that he’s so open about his mental health .
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿… “Me’ Bible”…Psalm 103:14 “For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.” (KJV)
Such a down to earth guy much respect
The man's a legend I used to think he was a knob but to come back the way he did deserves massive respect the man says something and makes it happen
Tyson talking about he don't care about the money and that he doesn't need flash things whilst walking in his Gucci shoes makes me laugh
This money bollocks is easy to say for a millionaire who was going to donate the money he doesn’t need or want 🤷🏻‍♂️
something about his way of talking make you feel hopeful. Maybe his carefree expression
He’s so lucky to have a good lady by his side, hopefully one day I’ll find a good partner too 🥲
Say what you want about Joshua but I don’t believe fury anymore. 3 years as champ not one defence.
It's very cool to see the respect he pays to his wife.
Jeez Tyson looks CRISP - Wilder is going to get it again...
I can listen to tyson all day
All AJ fans do is talk about resume, but AJ has never once fought another heavyweight in their prime that was as big as him and as dangerous as Wilder. Fury is the real deal and AJ is a hype job bum. Ruiz is better than AJ. Fury would smash anthony any day of the week.
25:00 I know what that's like to 'live in that moment'  Just best not to drink at all 😑
@17:30 who tf has that impression?? He has had two good fights in his life Vlad and Wilder and Wilder has not had one good fight in his life other than fury.. So I would love to know who is thinking he is fearless.
Awesome Neville great interview Tyson what a inspiration guy
Him and Deontay Wilder and be great friends right now if Deontay Wilder didn't make all kinds of excuses why he lost and cried like a baby
Tyson is best boxer the world has ever seen and also the best man very .
Loving that Tee shirt Fury, top fighting and funny guy haha 😆
When a cheater prances around like a conquering hero lol...
Absolute champion.
Tyson the contradiction Fury.  Joshua will manhandle you.
Im really struggling with my mental health at the moment and this interview really made me understand that your not alone. I love how he gives his wife so much praise for being there through a lot of bad and dark times. I see a completely different side to Tyson Fury after watching this and I really like it. Gary also did a great interview just let him speak without interruption. Hope he continues to have success both in the ring and at home with his family. Nice one Sky Sports more content like this would be awesome. Thank You
He transformed into a fit John Locke.
Every Tyson Fury fight is exciting and special. A true heavyweight legend.
19:36 the funniest part of the whole video, this is why I love this guy
Funny thing that Tyson is laughing because Ruiz won the frist fight. First of all its heavy weight and it was lucky punch. What about knockdown from Cunningham Tyson or fiht wit Otto Wallin....
Excellent interview. A lot of hatred, bigotry and ridicule has turned to respect for Tyson. He's right about the super rich and billionaires- even multi-billionaires want more and more, and never mind the massive number of poor and starving  Of course he's not perfect- who is?- but he's refreshingly honest and he is a credit to the travelling community. Of course he is exceptional, extraordinary, but there are many other good, decent, kind romanies and travellers unfairly tarred with all sorts of insults. Good humans not vermin. I wish them and Tyson well. Oh and not forgetting Hopey Price, a likeable talented young boxer. As for Gary, maybe he should do a boxing commentary and we could have another orgasmic moment.
2 beers in an I’ll get a cab home  10 beers later, I'm good to drive   Alcohol is a fucker
9:20 relatable
https://youtu.be/lMSVjTp0A9I
Awesome !
Tyson Fury is a superhuman his DNA should be persevered for the good of human kind
Tyson Fury is a legend! I love his sense of humour and I admire his honesty.
Honestly my English is rubbish I have no interest in boxing and clicking on the video out of interest. Half an hour I saw myself enjoying and wanting more. Great personality. All the best for him. He seems really humble funny and level headed.
❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏
Gary Neville - Such a great bloke. Can listen to him all day. Great job.
IDK HOW & MY DAD WILL MURDER ME 4 SAYIN THIS BUT IM BECOMING A GARY NEVILLE FAN
Usyk is definitely in his prime. Parker, Whyte , breazelle, . Who has fury fought other than wilder? Had to cheat to beat Cunningham!!! Should not of been allowed to fight klitchko.
Absolutely love this man Tyson Fury❤️
Why Gary Neville SLY News. He is fucking useless and knows fuck all about BOXING.
Neville don’t no anything about football what’s he interviewing a boxing champ for doughnut
was never too keen on tyson fury but having watched interviews with him over the years i absolutely love the bloke.the way he talks aswell youd think he was from the black country...proper tiptoner lol
A lie a second Tyson Fury......apple certainly doesn't far from the tree....his dad is exactly the same. It's a shame because other than the 24/7 BS he is a likeable guy..👍
You know your the King of Sport when you can rock those shoes on the beach.  Good man. The way sport should be. Credit where it’s due
Brilliant interview and guest
lol he best be getting ready because wilder is coming to try and take his head off..
This guy is a fraud eventually he will get knocked out by aj 😂
he has OTK tshirt on but doesnt have asmongold!?
great talk!
more excuses fom the gypsy queen
Poor gary accidentally wore his daughters jeans
Tyson's looking great. nice n trim.
What a fucking champion this man is, Tyson's authentic greatness is such a breath of fresh air, a truth that has set me and I'm sure many others free as well.   Salute to the Gypsy King!
Fantastic chat
would love a Emma Raducanu interview
Top interview! Real stuff. Both nice guys
Man, what a gift! I'm jealous.
https://youtu.be/6OOnBw-ngxA Bbcc song on Tyson fury, big up Bradford chiller
Wilder has a hard hit because of the metal in his hand it’s like holding a £5 coin in your hand there is a lot more power then it would be without the £5 pound coin in your hand and I really wonder how Wilder can box legally, but Tyson Fury will give him another boxing lesson.
One of the best channels on YouTube. Great interviews. Neville is a great interviewer. Shoutout from Detroit!
I respect Tyson Fury, he is 100% real and funny. Can't wait for the fight in October with Wilder,
"deep mud on beach" sign then quick edit to garys platinum white shoes 👌
He's a liar. He announced he'd be fighting Joshua himself after months of negotiation, but now he turns around and says the fight was impossible to make? And he wasn't just "out for years due to addiction and depression" he was banned for using PEDs. Can't trust anything that comes out of his mouth after that.
The last ten questions seem kind of off the cuff but they're deceptively well put together ones, always bound to get to someone's own quirks (we all have em) it'll be great to FINALLY get this trilogy (that none of the 'real' boxing fans wanted to see) out of the way. Great job again Nev, coming from a Kopite that stings a bit, but can't deny the content.
What a man
Tysons shoes say it all
This guy is one of the biggest cheats in the sport of boxing  tyson "the da*n cheat" fury
I have no idea how anyone can dislike the new Tyson Fury - his breakdown is the best thing to ever happen to him as his journey coming back from that is so inspiring and has shown his true character. I can't wait for him to smash Wilder and then AJ as it'll make the AJ Wilder fight that much better!
This is a great interview, 👏👏👏👏
The interviewer kinda looks like Frank Ribery.
If ducker Wilder wins, he won't fight AJ.
I can't wait to see ducker Wilder getting beat up again.
🤴 👑
Gary is better até this than he was at Football
Fury is a solid brother 💪🏿
Fury only Bigs up Wilder to make his win look better. When the reality is Wilders not beaten one genuine World class fighter in his whole career
Neville locking down strikers for man u now smashing the interviews on ya mate true legend all way from Australia
13:33 "Boxing's a bit different to football, because if you lose a game, it doesnt really matter"  Poor Gary deeply disagrees but has to say "yeh".
Tyson there is forever an there is a place called heaven my friend!! And there is a simple way to get there, just believing in JESUS CHRIST the Son of GOD and the fact that he was born from a virgin died on the cross for mankind's sins and was raised from the dead on the third day and ascended to heaven to sit at the right hand of GOD the Father. Thats it! Its a gift from GOD because he loves us. And all you have to do is believe! NOT HOW YOU BEHAVE! ITS WHAT WE BELIEVE THAT SAVES US! AND NOTHING ELSE! Thats what most preachers and evangelicals would say to people, that You have to believe in GOD and his son JESUS and not sin and go to church and be water baptised to be saved! Well that don't sound like a free gift, if you have to do something to earn it!! Because hell is real and you don't want to go there!! And try reading that Bible you have Tyson! Its not a boring book at all, and its not fairy tales either! Its full of 100% truths!! GOD BLESS YOU TYSON AND GOOD LUCK ON YOUR FIGHT WITH WILDER!!
Doesn't care about business and other ventures. Goes to Saudi Arabia with the WWE. Hmmmmm
Great interview. Credit to Gary Neville 👏🏾
The phobic burglar principally suck because marimba precisely nod despite a happy chess. nebulous, unable space
Lovely guy Tyson but he don’t half talk a lot of shit.
Thank you Neville Am a man utd supporter and a boxing sport fun and a T.Fury supporter and always enjoy everything about them.  Thank you so much and God bless you for this interaction with Tyson.It’s both entertaining and edifying.With some of us that have heard tough times in the past...This has been so good...     He’s not like others that only speak negativity and are so selfish in different ways...The honesty is amazing and his testimony is supernatural. Love from Uganda 🇺🇬                                             God bless you...
*Deontay Wilder actually has METAL rods in his hands.* It’s absolutely BS. Look it up if you don’t believe me. I hope Fury batters this clown again.
Bored stiff of this 'fighting man' who rarely fights to be honest.
Did he just say he was never optimistic about the AJ fight.. lol this guy fam.. he announced the fight and it was him that pulled out!! He should be switching at him team if that the case not blame AJ.
That's a helluva human being. Now that's a real role model.
Gary Neville has bigger legs then tyson lol
I love fury. Absolute legend
Ol' nevs looks like he's been through ten rounds with tyson
Tyson arms are as big as that dudes head.
Furry could care less about a belt he does it because he like fighting.
Tyson looks very healthy and young for his age. Thats awesome. I know he said he is all about health now. Eathing correctly and everything else.
This is just top class! Fair play Neville on a brilliant interview with the champ
tyson fury. what a gem. who couldnt love this guy? best sports personality of the decade
It's his frank admission of Deontay Wilder's power between 18:20-20 mins for me. You'd hardly hear rivals talk up their opponent's strengths like that. That's such a manly thing to do. Kudos mate
Why is Gary Neville interviews Tyson Fury?
He's a top bloke Tyson 👏
Superb. That is all
I think after Boxing he should go into Movies. He reminds of the late Sean Connery - the way he speaks. Likeable Guy
He's the goat!🐐
“I never had that problem” Relatable😂
He walked out in sombrerro and poncho?! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
this man is insane, he came back from all the depression and anxiety and destroyed wilder's career on his comeback and is about to do it again...
Tyson fury mouthing off his BS again about AJ don’t want it delusional bum. Lost respect for him waffling
The dislikes on this video is sad! them people have to be fucked up more than Tyson was going through his worse! To do what he done IS AMAZING!!!! Let the haters hate while u thrive!!!!!!!
Legends.
you got married at 14?
So clever about life
I don’t know why but Neville looks so much like Ribery here
I love the man that is the Fury!! What an entertainer!! I’m scared for AJ…
That would be nice, build a ring on the beach one summer and have a fight.
Am I the only one concerned for him gaining weight?
Gary is great at these interviews, seems very natural!
Tyson Fury is The Man, as real as they come.  Peoples Champion! 👊💯💯
Why does Garry have bigger legs than Fury?
I don’t care about money, I can live in a council house, but I don’t want to lose money over a court case. He is so full of shit.
"I don't think I will ever lose a fight"  💪 Damn Tyson Fury spewing fire! Cannot even begin to imagine how far we'd all go if we had that level of intrinsic confidence 💯🥊 What an interesting and raw interview🙌👏 ❤ Love these 2 legends, from Cape Town, South Africa 💪
Tyson skips leg day
So much to love about this ... great wrok
Great interview mind you. Thumbs up
Same blah, same ol TF, i was on 'drugs alcohol and wanted to kill myself' , change the record mate, we all have our problems, we've overcome those dark times, hats off to you. Stop treading on old ground, live for tomorrow not yday
Doesn't even have a can of coke during camp. Nah but you've smashed that Caramel Latte tho ain't ya Tyson
This guy tells so many lies and contradicts himself what a fruit loop
Fucking legend
Thank God for Tyson Fury.. Last of the Great Men. Keeping it Real. Good work Mr Neville.. Great Interview.
Tyson fury is such a genuine guy. Tyson fury is inspirational. I suffer from depression. Thank you Tyson for sharing your mental health story.
Great interviews. Keep it coming neville
awesome, both of you!
Iv always thought that Joshua didn't dodge any fight but both of Tyson and wilder called him out and the fights nvr happened
Tyson says that he doesn't care about money, status, fancy living etc but it seems that he's chasing a celebrity lifestyle in Vegas?
I love this man - he is 100% correct, if you haven't been there with mental ilness, you can't understand it. Inspiration for all who have suffered, and those who continue to suffer.
Tyson Fury. Best buddy material, And so unnassuming. Gary great too.
Never sell ur soul to the illuminati and allow urself to turn evil..and u will be happy..bet they wont let u talk about jesus anymore..am I right? And wen u stop giving jesus the glory uv sold! Then I hear u talk about ur bible as I'm writing this and uv restored my faith in u big man🇨🇮💪🙏
What a lovely man, a credit to boxing and the north of England!
"Only got two or three fights left because their are no more challenges" isn't that the reason why you should clear out every single contender and then give unknown guys a shot just like Ali did in the Golden Era if you ever want to be considered in the same sentence as any of the greats?
unhappy billionaires.......... people always say money doesnt buy happines... The people who say that, are the ones with ALL OF THE MONEY!!! Gimme a few bob to pay the bills !
He skipped leg day
Hope they make a movie of tysons life and they do it right, it should be awesome. Love him or hate him, he's right in what he says in this interview.
Enjoyed that 👌 👍
Tyson Fury is cheater
It's easy to say it's not about the belt...seeing as it's all about that particular belt!
People really are jumping on this mental health wagon what a load of shit everyone has it these days grow up
Tyson is the people’s champion
Joshua is a chicken nugget 😅😂🤣
Ok let’s try and count how many times they say AJ’s name in this interview. I’ll come back after it’s over and see if I can’t keep track. My guess it will be to many to count.
He does talk crap
Fantastic interview Gary! Tyson Fury is brilliant and honest - doing so much to highlight mens mental health. Thank you for being so honest Tyson, I believe if the Joshua fight happens you KO him, he will avoid the fight though I fear.
Ask your golden gippo why he needs to cheat in the ring.
The greatest cheater ever more like lol.
How come he never talks about all the cheating on his wife?
Tyson Fury is just a brilliant proper man. He is so self aware & so much smarter than people give him credit for. His honesty is something we should all aspire to. I have worked on oil rigs for all my life, over 35 years & Tyson Fury is the absolute definition of a mans man.
This interview changed my perspective  about this guy.  Honest and inspiring . I used to see him as a rude and  disrespecting but  I can't see this here .
Meditate and you will be happy every time ;)
Your a inspiration wot a come bk indeed nuff respect brudda 💯 nuff blessings
I suffer from mental health myself and I totally understand wot he’s talking about , thank u Tyson for being honest and making it more aware blessings 💯
“Wilder is the biggest puncher in the sports history “ Mike Tyson listening like are you sure pal ?
$80m? COME ON NOW! That's nonsense. Fury is starting to lose credibility. He's spouting too much nonsense and huge claims. Starting to head down to Wilders level. Such a pity. He'd done such a great job to rebuild his popularity and reputation.
“I fought the best men in their prime “ is he having a laugh ? I like aj and fury the same but it’s undeniable that aj resume is 10x better than fury’s
Those shoes need burning
Gary and Tyson
Loved story about Wilders punching true class interview
is it me or have i never heard Tyson talk about his mother in any of his interviews?
what an absolute geezer so humble and to admit his faults is something you just never hear from people especially those in the limelight the way he talks about depression and anxiety I'm sure people that go through that stuff must appreciate it
Definitely today's Mohammed Ali such a character who speaks so much truth.
This is THE heavyweight champ of our era. Inside and outside of the ring! THE PEOPLES CHAMP!
You can't hate him. The way Tyson speaks make me smiling, and the best part is that he's very honest about himself. We all can learn a lot from a champ like him.
Cunningham decked tyson well before your lay off so cut the crap
All the games are over. He’s got millions convinced, one problem is the eyes don’t lie. The only lying eyes do is when they are lying on top of a mans face staring at those bright lights. 1,2 wilders coming for you 3,4 he’s gonna break your jaw 5,6 you on the canvas like a crucifix 7,8 you ran and tried to hide but you escaped 9,10 the real king reigns supreme again
What a warrior  what a comeback great interview and honest down to earth one
Gary Neville's armpits on fire?! Look at that strut!
i cant tell if thats a small coffee cup or a normal sized one
Very enjoyable to watch and hear about his life and views.i liked him.before I watched this his advice is a big help to others with issues too.he is definitely a role model to learn from .long live the undisputed to be champion of the world
Tyson needs to fight Joshua then he can be the best of the best.we are so lucky too have and Joshua both great heavy weight champions in Britain.and both made mistakes and learned and earned the riches .only one person beats Tyson in this future fight .tyson himself if he dont take Joshua seriously. He is the best he has fought. When it happens
You can’t not like Tyson. He’s such a genuine, nice, honest guy.
Although I’m wilders fan, but I love fury more… genuine characters, great guy. I love him more
He is fake.
Some people still feel like that once it’s in your head it snit coming out daff lad
Absolutely Brilliant, amazing story
Another belter of an interview by Gary. Well played lad!  Bring on the next one...
I’m glad this interview on Overlap allows non-boxing fans to get an insight into Tyson Fury as a person and the true champion that he is. The media and plaudits of this world have never really given Tyson his fair due credit when he became World Champion after beating Klitschko. Why? Because he didn’t fit the typical British sensation profile coming from a traveller background, unpredictable, the joker, the drink & drugs, never changed for the camera’s….he was labelled before he could even be celebrated. He is quite possibly the best British boxer ever and a credit worthy example to raising awareness of mental health/depression and coming through those obstacle. It’s about time he wins that BBC SPOTY award too!
This sport really is pathetic that there are multiple world champions in the same division. What a joke... Love Tyson Fury tho
Can't wait to see big momma and wilder go at it.. I really hope big momma don't duck him again
I'd like to see Tyson fight a healthy  Ruiz.. I don't think he could deal with his hand speed
I don’t believe a word he says about I don’t care about money, now he’s a multi millionaire he would say that, all he talks about is money
God bless you, Tyson. I love you. We all do. Go kick that big dosser's arse.
I have followed Tysons career from the beginning  and the worst thing to do to him is to knock him down he always gets up and wins he even won the last round with Wilder I am 60 yrs and for me he is the best heavyweight ever. Tyson just read 1 chapter of the Bible a day and you will be amazed how much more you will be blessed by God. GOD BLESS. P.S Props to Gary brilliant.
There is no way you can be upset about what's going on in boxing when you back Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder. You are either fully behind it, happy with all  skullduggery, or you are just a simpleton.
Good to see so many positive comments... fury and neville deserve it for such a candid entertaining interview
This guy accuses others of not fighting people in their prime, but takes credit for beating a 39 or 40 year old champion.  He accuses others of fighting low level opposition to make a lot of money rather than risk losing, yet he is the king of asking for 2-3 tune up fights to make millions.  Everything he says is true, but mostly about himself.  He is the shithouse.
great listen and watch ... wot a man fury is
This must be the only place he can BOTH get his PED's and NOT cheat on Paris with hookers and cocaine.
80 bags of solid sand, that enough to cover that sand Tyson Fury is walking on:-))
What a man
Gary totally foisted Tyson Fury with that painting.
Really want to know where you can buy the t shirt
No more challenges they've all been smashed to bits! What a joker! Like who? He aint fought anyone
2 legends 😁🤝
🤣😂😂 Furys fought the best in their prime...hahaha what a bullshitter. Who's that then, he's fought fuckin bums, bus drivers n nobody dossers. 2 names on his record,  Klitschko n Chisora, that's it. Look at all the names on Joshua's resume, takes the piss out of Furys
Fun fact: that's an XL coffee in his hand.
If he isn’t the biggest motivation for a lot of people than I don’t know who is? Legend
Check Fury's opponents records right from fight one, then check Joshua's, END OF ARGUMENT. The only good fighter Fury fought was Klitschko.....but Klitschko didn't even try to win, plus Fury had already tested positive after the Hammer fight and shouldn't have even been allowed to fight for the title. He had the two easiest runs to a title shot in HW history and here's another thing where he can be mentioned in history, he took part in the worst HW title fight ever.  Also despite holding the belt twice, has still never defended it.
I never believe a word this clown says
2 Mancs down to earth as on the same wavelength
Always oozing with confidence.. that’s why he is we’re he is 💯
That was bloody great 👌
Tyson Fury inspired me recovering from mental breakdown 6 years ago ..his example and honesty and humour helped motivate me out of the depths of total despair got be going back to a gym first time in years and stop feeling terrible and hopeless Thanks Tyson 😊👍
Klitschko was not in his prime when fury beat him , fury contradicts himself all the time . Even his own father rubbished him for taking the wilder 3rd fight . If he wanted to  fight AJ all he had to do was relinquish the WBC belt to fight aj no need to pay 80 million
Very inspiring. Top bloke
No song ?!? We want a song !!
Can someone ask Tyson when he's gonna put that $7 million dollars up for housing for the poor , he claimed he would do with purse from wilder 1 fight  .
Wot a guy!!! Rate legend Tyson! 👍😎
What a lot of people forget. Fury beat klitchko in klitchkos back yard when klitchko was younger and fresher. Joshua fought a older klitchko,struggled immensely,had to turn it from a boxing match to all out slugfest and landed a haymaker uppercut and got the victory by fine margins. Levels!
"I'd fight him on here, I'd flatten him" - cameraman focuses on Tysons loafers.
Love Tyson he’s so real and a great motivational human.. helped me loads either way lovely guy..  thanks
This is a beauty to behold!
Hahaha jealous of a chicken nugget damn
absolutely  Fuckin brilliant...fantastic
This interview is so much more interesting than the AJ interview
Great interview, oh and I like the t-shirt.
jake paul could knock AJ out I reckon
20:28 Did he just say he's just took a month off? When was this filmed wtf
Swear this guy just constantly seeking for attention always had a pitty party for himself🥱
best men in their prime? You fought 2 top 10 contenders in all your fights and never defended a belt. So b.s.
Clown 🤡 of the heavyweight division..
this was NOT a  interview  tyson does not stop talking
Tyson says he beat the best men in their prime who were they 🤣🤣
I love seeing and hearing Tyson like this. I hate all the nonsense trash talk, I know it’s part of the game and just for show but still don’t like it.
Fury looks in great shape. Looking forward to him beating Wilder into a bloody mess.
I have so much respect 🙏 for this man💪
His name should be Tyson the contradiction fury I'm a big fury fan but he don't half contradict sometimes
Greatest heavyweight ever?   There's very few you can argue would have beaten him. Ali .... maybe but small. Lennox ... maybe. Foreman .... maybe. Dempsey .... too small. Joe Louis .... small but maybe. Jack Johnson .... maybe. Frazier .... too small.
Go on Tyson 👊👊👊👊👊💯
Everything this man says contradicts everything he says
Such a great interview. Love Tyson
Probably the best Clip on Youtube i haven seen this year!
I had a girlfriend, wife, we were together since ae were 16. Depression hit me hard around 26, drugs and addiction became an issue and she walked out when i was nearly 29. I don't blame her, i still love her and its been 3 years since we split but she was always my rock, she kept me in line as much as anyone could and kept me  grounded so I understand what hes talkimg about all too well there. I just wish she had the strength Paris has and stood by me when things were bad, when i wasn't who I was before or could be again but it is what it is. I have only myself to blame even though i tried my hardest to keep it together, anyway  I'm happy for and admire fury so much, all the best to you mate.
Fury is shaking in his boots from aj. He does not want that fight. He would sooner fight wilder 6 times before joshua
36:40
Same old G !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So many fools on here, raw honesty this, raw honesty that. Pipe down he's a walking contradiction
Yes Tyson did loose alot of weight in 7 months but hes in his prime of youth, we all look at Tyson and think he's way older than he actually is, He should be able to do what he done imo, as great of a feat it was.
Yeah wish him well, very detailed account of his experience, a lot to deal with and still come out heavyweight champion
I think the 418 dislikes are from the Joshua camp 👊🥊🥊
T Fury is open and a very funny guy("..No challenge left, they have all been smashed..."  I love listening to him. My favorite boxer since Iron Mike. I wish him a good end of his boxing career with wins in his last fights.
Tyson Fury is a truthful man I have total respect for him.
No wonder so many people love Tyson, One of the most honest interviews I have ever seen, An inspiring story from an inspirational man.
Walking , talking, releasing endorphins   Always better to walk and talk for a good conversation. If you're sat somewhere or standing still, I can imagine you're a bit self conscious of what you should be doing with your hands and stuff on camera. Excellent interview it feels like a podcast.
The irony of Gary Neville talking about the boxing promoters being dirty and ruining the sport choosing who plays who and when whilst also representing the company that ruined football in Sky is the funniest part of this great interview
Absolute rubbish, arum could of used a clause back in December 2020 to withdraw the rematch which he didn't. Why didn't furys team check with arum he used that clause?
The Gypsy King👑
Imagine if football was like boxing and the greatest teams kept avoiding each other for fear of losing. Shame boxing has such BS politics
He don’t want to fight he’s a joke man
From a man with mental health issues what he says is totally, it’s something you can’t control. Honestly Tyson you are an inspiration to me ❤️💯
Gary Neville tackles people brilliantly, a pleasure to watch, how he brings out the best in all his guests (Arsenal Supporter you're forgiven).
Aj has to many fake fans who has aj beaten
I think fury is right when he says two prime fighters rarely fight because one is weary.  I think In the back of ajs mind he must think fury is better then him
Game recognises game moment 💯
All total  bullshit you ducked aj just like you have been ducking Dylan White for years  Never defended a belt  Klitcho and wilder the only two world class fights you have had  Other fighters might of been in there prime but when their  prime is domestic level it says nothing does it  Just like last time excuse after excuss
I don't know a single person who likes AJ , because of his demographic the TV studios believe they need to big him up.  Less we forget the day AJ told the British public to boycott white owned shops and to only shop at black owned shops. 🙂
Depression is a serious mental illness. I've been suffering from depression for 23 years.
Gary walks like he's avoiding landmines on the beach
40 minutes of bi-polar Tyson Fury lying, not worth wasting time on
Fury talk wayyy too much shit
anyone else just wanna put that coffee cup in the bin for him?
I love this guy the gyspi king is legit. Its funny I thought this guy was trash proved me wrong beat the crap out of wilder and jousha still running we know ant don't want any smoke from fury
Real decent interview 👊👊
I could listen to Tyson's shoes all day lit.
Luke talks a good game.  He could easily become a politician.
Tyson fury needs to become Muslim to find peace & happiness
Fury saying AJ fought FIGHTERS IN their 40's, ok then I ask why Fury dodged them FIGHTERS when they were younger?
Reflect of Fury saying "He fought all the BEST FIGHTERS IN THEIR PRIME"  Can someone please reply to me THE BEAT FIGHTERS IN THEIR PRIME, that Fury fought...because I ain't seeing them on his CV...  Fury talks pure bollocks.
I love Fury but i'm sorry; AJs CV pisses all over his. I like how honest Fury is but i think he needs to give AJ a bit of credit for who he's beaten since 2015
Cracking interview.
What a lovely man, he really brings so much to the world by example and acknowledging his failings. Inspiration!
Brilliant 👏
Is it just me or does fury look like shit again, not to the extent of before but he seems to have put abit of weight on and looks like he needs a good nights kip
What a brilliant interview. I absolutely admire Tyson for speaking so openly about struggling with a mental health illness. Hopefully this will help other men to come forward and ask for help. What a legend 🙌
I used to joke about Tyson but now he's one of my favourite sportsmen.
Eric Cantona watching like "I cannot believe zat-a zis smol man, gave away my painting"
Tremendous, I truly enjoyed this episode.
Great interview, 👍
A real life super hero!! Great bloke! Determined, Hard working & Inspirational.
Awesome interview, his unabashed explanation of mental health, the strength of a partner who has stuck with him despite this, and his current view on time, moments, and self-control... I couldn't care less how people compare him to past boxers... this man advocates issues that transcend the sport he is in.
Love the honesty from this guy. Massive respect Tyson
You’re my hero, Tyson. I wish I was diagnosed with Bi-polar, at least it would be a reason for my downs. Thank you for fighting on, Johnny
Fury a real one you can not hate a man like this #champ
does he ever stop telling us about his depression?
I'm 33 and until fury returned I couldn't care for boxing but this man is such an inspiration and now I watch all his fights
Loved that hes a deep thinking Tyson boss
The shirt choice from tyson 👌
Great interview
What a nice guy
Can’t take the his idiot seriously anymore. He’s never once defended his belts. His stock is going down.
To be honest... Fury is the champ. If Joshua doesn't accept the fight then he's accepting that he'll never be the best... ever. Make it happen guys or risk your legacy.
He's made mistakes, but I think that's why I like him. Plus hes a hell of a show man
Gary Neville wants a system a kin to the UFC , which comes with its own problems.
I love Tyson Fury great champion and Gary Neville is a great interviewer and that's coming from a liverpool fan
Can I have 100k then tyson. I will deffo be happy.
is anybody going to acknowledge that t-shirt
What a blessing this man is to sport & general life shittery, absolutely wonderful... If he can wear loafers without socks on the beach, he deserves to defeat anything life throws at him.
I just don’t get this argument about joshuas resume. I get that a lot of the guys he’s fought have been older, but that’s all that’s available. The only person a lot of people seem to think AJ can prove himself against is fury and according to fury that can’t be made. So who does he fight?
100% better than AJ’s interview.
"I don't get butterflies and don't get scared" but I just refuse to fight any contenders! #whopper
"Failure is a bruise not a tattoo" I like that saying it's so true 💯 I love big Tyson he's an inspiration
Fury didn't back out of the fight...Arum and Warren didn't read the Wilder contract.
The only prime heavyweight fury is talking about is Vladimir. Name me another one 😆
Honestly, he's such a good bloke. Just an honest man.
That’s a long beach 🏖
Where did Tyson get that Shirt from I like it to
Wilder has fought nobody and fury has fought one decent fighter in Klitschko  When he's talking about boxers taken easy fights  ''hes talking about himself" AJ flattens this Dosser
How did u do it tyson iam struggling
I’m from Bessemer Alabama this is motivating inspiring when we can show the world our imperfections we show we are human
He's got a cheek saying AJ hasn't fought a top Heavyweight in their prime. Furys fought 2 and 28 bums
After watching AJ interview few weeks back and hearing his take on why the fight didn't happen.....and then watching this and hearing Tyson's take on it, its hard to know who to believe but I feel like Tyson doesnt have as much an ego so am inclined to believe what he said......Massive heavyweight champs don't like to fight each other because of what they stand to lose, Tyson doesn't care if he loses so long as he knew he gave his best, AJ seems to have more to lose.
You know Tyson is a big guy every two step he takes Gary taken 8😂😂
How can you not love this guy?
Your shit house all talk all bout money
Excellent.
Best comeback since LAZARUS
Well said big man behind every good man there is always a better woman fact 👍
Tyson fury who don’t care about fame or money but appeared in the WWE 😂😂😂😂
“Failure is a bruise not a tattoo” beast of a quote
Talks Absolutely bollocks
The gift though.  Wooow
You've got to respect Fury and his honesty , open about his faults , proper man .
Fantastic interview. Tyson is so open about issues he has had. It's like a breath of fresh air.
Class content
He doesn’t want the AJ fight because he will get ko
I get these extreme anxiety attacks and it is not good. Its just the thought that some of our worst nightmates coming true and Its just inexplicable sometimes.  Thanks for highlighting that Tyson. 35:10 Wow!!! Just Wow!!
Hero
He talk that much crap he believes it. He’s all about the money. Hope he get KO in his next fight.
Can't say your not arsed about fame and money when you went on WWE
What an inspiring man Tyson fury, heavyweight champion, mental health Champion, what a guy
Serious question before I watch this please   Been looking forward to this, but can someone please tell me….how much of it is talking about mental health and/or covid ???   Cheers
Fury is full of contradictions.
Tyson Fury is a big liar
Tyson Fury is one of the most genuine men in boxing. I could listen to him all dayhe is intelligent, honest and a credit to his family.
He is a bloody genius.
Gary has great point about boxers trying to implement one belt one champion...  Just too much greed about... and tyson right about mayweather pacman too...  Its like khan v brook should of happened but if it did now it would not have the buzz it once had
My opinion on fury changed when he came back from what he did and when he fought for mental health and the homeless and donated his purse... i always respected his skills... but now he has my whole respect... The true champ!!! Would prefer see him fight dillian whyte than joshua as well as believe thats the fight of fights
0 Title Defenses. Enough said
Tyson is the king! Long live the King 👑
Great video. To those who had to get their phones out because they saw two people they recognised. Stop being that sad cunt!
Tyson Fury behaves like a man who has nothing to lose.... after boxing I think his journey in life will get bigger
What a working contradiction this guy is and a proper conman. Didn’t he announced he fight and said the contracts were signed only to say otherwise now. Grow a per my friend and fight AJ, Whyte et all
Fury is so funny. "I fought the best in their prime" klitschko was 39, Wilder 34 but i would Say Wilder is still at his best. Who else Chisora. Fury fought 3 level Guy. Went down against a cruiserweight. And Never defended his belt. Otto walin sefer seferi😆🤭
Neville by far the best interviewer about class act!
Fury should be stripped. He's blocking the wbc. No title defense for almost 2years
This is the kind of insight fans want..The Footballers Football show was like this and Sky dumped it.  Once a story too insightful comes out they will dump this great show too.
That was an awesome interview, Tyson appears to be a really down to earth guy
fury is a fantasist..a liar..
Fury is class .What a man..
Both are brilliant great video
Supurb listen
Fury is the kind of guy you could just talk about life with all day
This Tyson guy just talks a lot of nonsense. He tells obvious lies and he thinks he has lots of morons who believe him.
What shot piece camera was this filmed on?
I’m such a huge fan of his
Been watching fury since the McDermott days fucking love this guy man always have always will carboo sale anyways be a part of us brilliant have a great day everyone one
Fury is the only boxer I have seen who gives big respect to his opponent and still talks shit at them at the same time 🤣 Deep down he is in love with wilders power but he still goes thought it. Gotta love this guy.
tyson "dr eggman" fury
Let’s be honest Neither Joshua or Fury have fought any one Decent even in the prime there currently isn’t any world class boxers in the Heavyweight Division   frazier Lewis Tyson foreman Holmes Holyfield Ali and a few I’ve forgotten about would’ve Beaten Fury and Joshua in the same Day Fury fought chisora twice and an old  klitchko wilder is the best he’s fought and picked out fights he can’t see losing They both seem like Decent Guys but Not anywhere Near the Greatest Aj has the same History fighting Boxers who are looking for a final pay Day Fury couldn’t knock out Chisora he fought him twice David haye sparked out chisora then got beaten twice by Tony bellew
Tyson a big dude that can move boy got skills fa sho respect
My god those shoes are ugly.
I use to dislike fury when he was batman and stuff but since his first fight with the the bronze bum as a person he's a legend but aj will do him but fury should have a gold statue
After I watched him dodge the wilder fight for extra money, you know he’s as fake as everyone else.
Wilder is a shithouse for all his accusations. Please wear his ring-walk suit to the ring from the second fight - you know the too heavy suit lol. And throw towels about the arena. He needs a good humbling.
If you believe this fucking crud💀🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I like Fury and dislike Joshua but Fury is talking utter shite with the court case Wilder brought up. Fury lives in the UK and could tell America to get fucked if he was a fighting man as he says he is, The UK isn't going to deport him to the US to face trial 😂
TF must act in Snatch 2 !!! Must
When is the interview with CR7!
i really dislike this guy
He moved to morecambe coz him and his Dad promised to tarmac me drive!! The Twats!! 😏
Love Tyson Fury great interview!
Great interview, Gary’s finallly found something he’s good at
Love the guy, he deserves all the glory he’s got. He will smash anyone that’s put in front of him. Legend
It’s true tho fury boxed wilder cos aj was to scared to fight him 100 fury is the one going down in history an to be fair even wilder manned up an boxed the best in his prime wilder got more balls then aj
Fury is the best British fighter ever
Gary Neville is a natural interviewer. He's a working class lad like Parky was. He puts people at ease and gets them to open up. Love Tyson. This interview is ace.
What a bloody great human being. The fury!!!
That’s awesome 80 million dollar lawsuit
'I don't really care about all that business stuff'  * releases two books, does WWE, does two ITV docuseries *  ... no hate, get that bag whilst its there, but have some self-awareness mate
I’m sorry fury talking about Joshua not fighting anyone is a joke he has beat 3 good fighters if your being nice Joshua has beat everyone he possibly can defends his belt against anyone he is asked to fight and it’s that simple
100mil for 1 fight to Gary's 9 net worth for a full time career..not fair
Most real and most humble
thank you  x
Absolute gold! Gary Nev just let's the interview flow with style and Tyson speaks his mind with complete honesty! A brilliant way to spend 40odd minutes! 🎸😎🤘
Gary “dya know something” Neville
Nice to hear his voice recovering and sounding like it did before his drug and beer bender
Loved it,  one of the old time greats of football interviewing one of the new time legends, with his pointers on mental health and being one of us, his story is one to be adored.  I bet the queen wont recognise his achievements in boxing and mental health awareness . Make Fury and OBE at least, he fights for his god and our country !! Also, award one to Paris, as she is the rock for  our WBC champ !
Apart from football Gary Neville was born to be an interviewer. He manages to bring the best out of everyone
"I'll fight him here now"... but you won't though will you.  No one actually cares about the fight anymore.  Neither will be remembered along the greats.  The sport is dying because of fighters like these ducking everyone
Also total respect to gary another legend  what a player
G nev and Tyson the gs of Manchester nobody cares about pep and Stockport
I dont doubt your hunger determination or your Will but your such a hypocrite boxing is a business too you as much as the rest You and Joshua could of fought years ago what a surprise you both had excuses The winner of you vs Dillian Whyte deserves Joshua fight
Love this bloke what a top man so doen to earth ! Why im a fan helps me with my problems god bless you big man tyson
tyson no longer lives there. his trainer now lives in his morecambe house..
He’s talks so much shit bless him.
Enjoyed that.
Arguably better than Ali. For me definitely better than Ali. No one even comes close not even Ali. Greatest of all times GOAT 🐐 Much respect long live gypsy king 👑
You guys are kings.
The disrespect to whyte is unreal, fury is ducking him. For sure
26:30 it’s hard to imagine seeing fury in the local weather spoons you’d think he’d get mobbed by people wanting pics and autographs
This was a fascinating interview. Really enjoyed this and the Keane interview. Gary Neville is brilliant and the people he interviews are so open and honest. Tyson was amazing and really showed another side to him. Brilliant YouTube. Please keep doing these.
I dont care is just bulshiit. just saying it  to sound likeble. He really gives a fuck
2 wonderful sportsmen. Both are amazing speakers and communicators. Tyson Fury has done more for metal health then he realises. The guy is a amazing talker, such a clever a complexed man. Well done Nev great interview
what a load of bologna!
Childish excusses from tyson fury.
Love the Gypsy King always speaks the truth and doesn't have a Ego.
better interviewer than Joe Rogan is our Neville
top lad
This guy is a liar ,he lies just to make himself look good and make others look bad , but his actions say otherwise
If you was at risk of being sued 80M for not fighting Wilder, why lie about it not being an issue and promote the Josha fight like it was 100% gonna happen?? exposed himself with that one. Trying to use the fact Josha knew, you told him and his team its not gonna be an issue, so its still your fault guy can never take accountability for these sort of things as it exposes all the lies he tells. I like Fury but the lies need to stop (probably used to doing it though lool)
I like Fury
But why 🤦‍♂️
Not yet defended a belt Fury.
Let's hope Fury shows up for the fight....I have my doubts.........
Fair play to Tyson Fury, I have suffered depression for 35 years, to talk about it as openly as he has will hopefully help many more young people to understand it. One of the strongest fighters out there has had many battles outside the ring and has won those as well.
I'm not a massive boxing fan but Tyson is a legend
This guy is a great boxer obviously - I can understand his initial depression after Klitschko as there are very few greats around anymore so that was it (loved to see him fight Lewis in prime :)  - However I'm looking at his legs here and his chubbyness how long before those fuckers get knackered :)
I actually love Tyson, just so personable.
Tyson fury DECLINE a fight with Mike Tyson   he will beat you  up so so bad man.  Mike Tyson  is the greatess boxer in history  the only thing you would come away with is serious  harm
Best pound to pound heavy weight in the world and a true inspiration to all
Who give Gary the black eye?
It quickly changed from 20 million to 80 million...
Neville dropping that first chest session in the gym walk 🤣
80 million dollar 💵 comment 11:52
80Mil? I Thought It Was 20Mil… Fury Fury Fury
He fought and beat klitchko for the championship 6 years ago. Yet had as many title defences as me
Really humbling and great to see Tyson speak, he is so natural, Gary has such a great way of getting people to open up but massive respect to Tyson he hasn’t come across talking shite and trash about Joshua and actually talks of respect. I love AJ but I always get a sense from AJ since his defeat that he thinks he needs to talk shite about everyone but himself. Fury doesn’t put on an act or play up to the media. Great interview, Fury V Joshua has got to happen for the good of the sport
Gary Neville has proven himself to be a top bloke these past few years. Aside from the the Valencia managers job he’s smashed everything he’s had a go at! Fair play to him!
Well done Tyson dealing with anxiety amazing hope you never have to go through another they suck.
Never heard so much shit in my life.
I'm so glad to be here to watch and learn 2 time Ring magazine champ with Ali Tyson is the best of his era I messed up my football career but his book inspired me and my daughter Lacey got it for me at Xmas I was depressed but now things are looking up, get up the Gypsy king and great interview by the way one love 💯
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Gary Neville is kl af
My god fury is as thick as shite and wildly un amusing
Knock that bum out . I’m with gypsy king 🤴  Go on lad
Best thing I’ve watched and learnt in a long time
Nice one Gary and that's from a Bolton fan? Ha.gudluck your doing some great interviews
Love him as a fighter and do rate him as the best heavyweight but my god I've never listened to someone who contradicts himself so frequently and so quickly. It's mad.
They Gypsy king he's the man who beat the man have a great day peace and love 💯
This guy has one of the greatest comebacks ever if not the greatest. Respect gipsy King 👑.
inspiration to us all champ. Just remember if you ever feel like that dark road is starting to appear again,? You've got ya beautiful family to look forward to, seeing them grow up? And you've got us your boxing family who think your a legend for what you have come back from. Godbless ya champ
What a straightforward Quality fella  , pmsl .
Tyson will hurt that bum Tyson will ko him  in 5  Tyson is a Trojan a proper champion beat the best at they best god bless Tyson be strong brother
One off the reales men alive..just spit facts and truth...
31:23 the classic "take a picture of my wife while Tyson Fury just happens to be in shot" routine  Really interesting listen, this one. Surprisingly candid take on pretty heavy subject matter.
Time to Fact check Fury!   1. Fury cant be Fury without AJ the Heavyweight Champion.  2. No Fury, you did not fight the best of the best at there time.  3. Fury Ran from the best.
fury doesn't have the mentality of a long reigning boxer like klitshcko. He wants to retire as early as possible. Fought only 2 good guys but keeps saying there is no one left to fight when there is a whole divison
👌🏾
its painful watching a fury interview cos of how much he lies
I love Tyson but wish he stopped talking crap and changing his story
What if Wilder beats Fury.. thats 1 all..
Great interview what a nice guy
Gary walking along the beach like he has two chickens under his arms 😂
So fury's drinking in camp?
Fury did back out of the fight. Its just facts
Craking interview!
Tell them billionaire mates to pay taxes...
Elite interview, great job from the whole team
Love his honesty - this makes for some of the best interviews I've ever seen
i feel like Fury and Wilder will be friends when they retire.
What Neville walking like he's shit himself
Best thing about Neville is he doesn't interupt and lets them talk, great quality for an interviewer! Asks the right questions and lets them talk!
Tyson casually channelling truth from the inner verse of his soul 👏🏻
Great interview
Look at the length of Furys arms!!
People forget how young tyson is still
Love Tyson but they do expose them self’s! Who has fury beat in his prime apart from wilder???
Tyson Fury is a legend … and Paris is clearly an amazing supportive person too
29.35 i'm so glad i heard this
Fake mr humble makes me laugh along with Eddie hearn.they knew the arbitration case with wilder was to be held so why would Eddie hearn as a top promoter talk about a fight with joshua v fury until the case was heard?its so they can bullshit the fans and say fury is running scared haha.fury fought Klitschko in germany who was a 10 year champion and wilder the most dangerous heavyweight in history who was champion 5 years,he fought him in America twice.hes nothing to fear from joshua i believe fury schools the big stiff .
I like this
"I've fought the best men in the world in their prime"!🤣🤣🤣 FFS..like who.?? What a load of bollox
Incredible man he is
Great interview Gary, Tyson Fury is a inspiration :D
That was a great watch👍
Love fury but he does talk some shit
Tyson is still ducking AJ
Enjoyable episode and Gary’s is good but he let Tyson get away with blatantly ducking Joshua.
He’s ducked Dillion whyte and a few others so stop talking shit ya big dosser, Otto wahlin was a lucky win that should have been stopped and AJ will have too much skill and ability that’s why it won’t happen sadly
Everyday I look for new fury interviews. Never get bored listening to the big man. I'm 41 years old and he is my hero. What a fella. Just wish I could beat the anxiety and mental health BS like he has. Massive respect to Tyson Fury.
Where can I get a Tshirt like that???
So regimented with his prep, training, diet (not even a can of pop) bed early etc, so why does he always look fat around the stomach in fights?
Absolute gentleman. Tyson not the manc 😂
I absolutely love how brutally honest Fury is! Amazingly refreshing to witness...
Hkw can I fight aj now I have tge wilder fight.so why agree to fight aj knowing this sane fact
When Tyson has the right interviewer (Gary/Radio Raheem), he is such a different person. I understand that you play the fool to sell a fight and he's great at it. I much prefer this Tyson though.
That was absolutely brilliant. Really enjoyed that. Both Gary and Tyson gelled well. Good stuff....
💩 💩 💩
Tyson is a awesome human being
Love fury amazing guy be honour to meet him and his family love few days with him just chilling chatting he’s fantastic man tyson we all love you mate your best god bless
Gary is just top ain’t he. These interviews are the best thing sky has put out in ages, credit where credits due.
I love AJ but juss based off the fact that Tyson is from the 0161 like myself I'll always route for him😅😅
Joshuas name is always needed for promotion this days.
Get your round in, lads!
Every second listening to Tyson is a joy man... What a guy!
Fantastic stuff.
What a nice bloke Tyson Fury is.
Hahahahahahh WOW $80 MILLION he would have to pay The Cahemp Deontay Wilder if he ducked the fight !!!!!!!! I think Fury will definitely show up to get beat up lol $80 MILLION Dollars DAMN Wilder is in a win win situation.
Fury has way too much money to have teeth like that. Yellow as piss
Great interview that
the tide retreats miles.
The Covid
Hope Joshua and Tyson make the fight happen and respect each other
Gary "in terms of" Neville
I get the 3 he said that are older now. But still u can't write off the belts aj has gotten. He has beaten dillian, Parker, ruiz an now fighting usyk. To me all he has to beat to have dominated this gens division is, wilder, Joyce, dubois and fury. Will he beat them all I dunno. Not saying he will or won't. I'm jist saying he can't knock what he has done so far.
Wow. This is so good! Gary is amazing...and Tyson is quite a character.
Please beat wilder. I hate boxing lately in boxing it doesn't matter if you lose because you lose you can just fight over and over again as many times as you want until you win and wilder knows he isnt good. He just needs to last long enough to get one shot thru and I bet wilder won't give Tyson a rematch if he does win. Tyson won the first fight everyone knows it second fight dominated wilder why is their a third. He should have to work his way back up. If wilder loses again is their another rematch clause hes just gunna keep fighting till he gets that 1 shot in cause even if he does doesn't make him better. If wilder sneaks that 1 knock out God giving punch in Tyson still is better only way wilder will be respected and seen as better than Tyson is if he out boxes him. A knock out punch snuck in is not boxing. I mean look at arguable the best boxer in the world floyd that's boxing not just fighting and waiting until you can sneak a punch in but fighting like shit the rest of the time tiring yourself out because ever punch you throw is all your power trykng to end it than and there. If you can't get it done you just keep fighting rematch after rematch till it happens and it will eventually doesn't make him good. Please Tyson this time finish him.
Them shoes though 🤮
I ADORE READING
You can see how much Tyson respects him and that makes him open up easily
Nevilles good at this game and Tyson is the goat
After alll the Hearn videos its easy to forget Fury's side; he wasn't the one fighting the legal case it was his lawyers.  Hes hardly 'avoiding' Joshua when he's forced into a 3rd fight.  Boxers never want to talk about fights down the line, he has to focus on Wilder he can't be talking about Joshua yet. This Interview was great 👌
As a mental health sufferah too Gypsy King inspires and gives me to get up, dust off and greet the day! Keep fighting Big Fella!
This man hasn't told the truth since 2016.  Just around the time he started PEDDING the life out of it.
What a top man Tyson is! Such an inspiring individual!
Love how peeps are going at the fighters (and the fighters themselves can hang their heads in shame) with regards to why the fight isn't happening.  It's all down to Furys promoters. They were the ones who told Hearns team the arbitration wouldn't get in the way, basically lying to everyone about the whole thing. Hearn and crew did all the legwork, organised a date, a venue, the split, everything, while Warren knew all along it was LEGALLY never going to be a possibility while Wilder had the arbitration on the go.  Absolute shambles the whole heavyweight business. Too many belts and sanctioning bodies and promoters playing all their cards at once. UFC has the right idea. One belt, one company, the best fight the best regularly. Sort it out boxing...
He talks so much rubbish AJ has fought so many boxer in there prime he beat world champions to get thos titles
Bob Arum kept saying it’s not a problem, and then it was, that’s not fury’s fault. Good interview Gary 👍
Can't help but like him...confident but self deprecating... simple  yet complex.... straight talking and fairly honest in his appraisal. A quiet wisdom and faith underlying. At times  thoughtful....often funny!
Tyson is spot on here, great interview.
i don't believe any word from Tyson Fury,he is a liar
What would you like to master? He said time travel but doesn't want to control time well how does that make sense 🤔
As someone who has mental health problems Tyson is a great advocate for people who suffer from it. He's a true inspiration story and watching him discuss the battle he had with depression in this interview is so relatable to me.
Hes a scam man, he just said how can he fight aj if he's fighting wilder, so he knew when putting pen t paper it wasn't going to happen, aj all the way
😂sky interviewing Fury but not promoting AJ USYK
Brilliant. Very inspiring 👏
A quality guy. Talks with so much clarity and doesn't waffle. Has a good perspective on what this life if about.
Could have had the 3rd fight tho everyone else was fighting
WHO WOULD HAVE EVER THOUGH, BOXING WOULD BE FUN?   THANK YOU TYSON!
Stay out of trouble!  You can't get better advice.
He is got to be the most honest bloke in the public eye of sport, seeing him come back and especially talk about his journey is an inspiration. Gary is a great interviewer too. I've watched most of these now and really enjoyed them. Take my hat off to you Tyson Fury. You are one in a million 💪🥊🏅
Meanwhile on dazn fights are actually happening lol👏 love fury but sky sports are a joke same noncence week in week out 😒 the comment section is embrassing! Are u BBC in disguise🤥
Brilliant 👏🏻
Tyson looks like he's put his legs on the wrong way round?
Cheater
Joshua has the best resume what are you talking about..
This guy is a proper inspiration, so is Tyson tbf
I respect fury for his comeback, but he's never had a title defence, with all his talk, he still has 0 title defence's
Tony furgeson>Khabib   Fury>AJ
Man after watching this , fury life is the most amazing journey that influenced 👍🙏
He fights like Mohammed Ali too.
Wish he had to explain why he wants to fight dilian whyte now. Bs artist. Used to be his biggest fan. Just fight aj then talk
The big lying dosser Luke Fury.
unreal interview 👏👏
Great job Gary!  Tyson...legend.
Chicken nugget, cos he’s a 6-pack…
I HATE sky but I love this. Amazing interviews. This you got right.
true champion
Happy wife, happy life
Every time I listen to Tyson Fury I get inspired. I used to be an alcoholic as well
33:07  Sorry Tyson - wait for the knock on the door & to be deported from the UK very soon  #lastdays
Loved this interview propa real chat it’s a manchester ting
Such a sound and well grounded guy is Tyson. As a human you simply can not have anything but respect for the fella. Clearly wears his heart on his sleeve and isn't afraid of the truth.👏 Neville isn't a bad interviewer either 😉😁
Biggest comeback ever of a cheat , caught taking pets and caught cheating on his wife , great champion and role model 😂😂😂😂😂
He lost his frist fight to Steve cuningham in my opinion he lost to otto Willian
I live for today..one of the best pieces of advice to take from this legend
Love Tyson Fury always gives God the glory
CMON AJ U BIG DOSSER. The gypsy king will eat u for breakfast ☘️💚
The most random collab in youtube Yet amazing
Deontay will absolutely regret taking the fight this soon. It's gonna be bad, guys.
You’d struggle to put two more sports people together, that annoy me more. Chapeau
Good boxer
My issues is finances, when from rich to nothing,just debt 😩
Stop going on about like you are the only person so...
Deal with it so ..
Everyone has depression so....
cool
If Me wife is happy then I can have an easy life.
Was Klitschko 39yrs old when he fought cheating Fury 🤔
Gary Neville is 5'11 but looks tiny here lol
Hated Neville because he played for united!!! What a pundit and also no interviewing people guy is actually really good and enjoy it.
tf are those shoes?
We all know John McGuinness is the man in Morecambe.
Shaking Stevens..aka neville
I feel like he exaggerats his mental issues sometimes
He explains anxiety so well!!!! can totally relate.....
Terrible camera operators and there are two of them  .... !!!  Plus a crowd of do not much producers and hangers on no doubt ...... big budget , low quality
good to see Gary doing something that doesnt involve bricks. Big Up Tyson💪
13:12 " I don't think the fight will ever happen " for all boxing fans who wants to see this fight, seems like Fury wants no smoke for sure
Fury is a nob, wilder will smash him this time around, AJ will smash him as well
Tyson Fury is a GREAT LIAR, don't believe a word that comes out of his mouth
Living Legend
Fury always contradicts himself and can easily be accused of being full of shit but I've suffered from anxiety and depression all my life and what he says is so close to the truth I couldn't call him a liar. I'm also the person who stays out when everyone goes home, but I'm the fittest person out of all of them: I can fully relate to all of what he says. And boxing politics are boxing politics. I don't believe him when he's trying to sell a fight, but what he says here seems pretty truthful. I'm still a fan.
I'd love to have a chat with Tyson.
I think sometimes Fury gets carried away with the banter BUT I admire his mental strength, comeback and his humour. He’s class..
Fury announced the fight before AJ then had to backtrack which made him look like a mug 🤷‍♂️ don't announce shit when there's an arbitration process going on? Furys a dick, I'm English and hope wilder smashes him in the trilogy, he'll do a billy joe and retire if that happens, a bit of a beatdown often humbles the cockiest of men.
Behind the scenes Aj and fury are boysss 😂😂
This guy is a fighting version of Don King. Very cunning and speak a lot of nonsense. the only difference is that King is smarter than him
What a man a stone wall
Take Tyson away from the boxing nonsense and he’s clearly a genuine, down to earth guy with a heart of gold.
Gary is basically a retired footballer come pundit! And that's basically it......or is it? Well no, because he actually has the knack of 'listening AND hearing' (they are totally different skills by the way),  and asking questions that a mate would ask you when you are on your own! Tyson, although knew this was an interview which was being aired to millions, opened up like a warm clam and enveloped a level of trust in Gary that isn't usually seen in normal interviews! Top interview, top responses and I look forward to the next wave from Sky :)
That was quality 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 great to see tyson looking fresh and real happy
Brilliant interview, could not turn it off and I’m the worlds worst channel flicker.
He talks more crap the more you listen
You mean to tell me GNev has never gone into training on a Monday after losing at the weekend and had a panic attack waiting for the gaffer to arrive
Love the Dream. O Dear 🙏
Superb interviewer and a superb interviewee. Great watch. Thank you.
Every  which way possible... all he is saying he won't fight Joshua because he's scared of losing his 0
No one has ever once noticed he's massively knock kneed
Another banger from Gary Nev. Fury, what a human you are. He makes so much sense when he talks
There’s only 1 Tyson Fury  #GoOnMoosh
Fury just the realist.
Superb viewing well done to all involved.  Draw parallels with the time and mental health and the happiness and to see some like Tyson Fury express the same and so openly is a beautiful thing.  For near 7ft man who could knock most people in world out in a strange way you just want to give him a hug.
What a sound bloke.
tyson we will go for a walk along the beech,no probs garry just wait to a grab ma shoes,
Brilliant  Interview  Salt of the Earth 🌎 people 👌👌👌👍👍👍
⏳💣
Great watch
Tyson the Ducker Fury.
What a gift 🎁
The best interview I've ever seen. PERIOD.
Wilder likes play victim
Great videos, stop the walking though…
This is the Tyson Fury i remember boss this.. but i cant let go of the fact he was muzzled up on his last interview it tells me he's defo not reading that bible enough.
Knock the dosser out shut up the haters.
Very very wise words from Tyson, really mature man👌👌
What an absolute legend 👏 🙌
Such a great interview by Gary Neville with Tyson Fury, discussing serious issues but with humour too. Beautifully filmed showing glorious Morecambe at its best 🌊🌞
Tyson is the man Aj is a manufactured robot for Eddie Hearn
I love ❤️ what he said about money really inspirational
Tysons shoes got some good coverage
Not even CLOSE to Ali,  sorry. And the comparisons shouldn't even go on.   There was ONE Ali. Just one. The GOAT. And he was that outside the ring as well. EVERYONE knew Alis name >THE WORLD OVER<,   if they watched Boxing or not.  That is NOT the case with today's Boxers in ANY division.
I used to hate Tyson fury, I never new his life outside boxing so I based my hate on his boxing for some reason,I just didn't find him exciting to watch,just a personal view,never looked like the fit,muscly,athletic,heavy weight boxing idol people want to grow up to be,but after following him since the first fight against wilder,and now especially 100% after this amazing interview,I have so much respect and he truly is an idol at what hes done and is doing,he helped me,and I'm sure hes touched and helped so many others, Teamfury,what a genuine person.
Superb interview. Gary has that gift of of interviewing, ask a relevant question and interupt here and there, but let the person open up.
I remember Tyson from being a kid when he used to visit his grandparents on our estate in partington, he was I giant bk then at 13/14 lol, what a genuinely good lad he is & he’s a credit to the traveller community. I see John in the local Tesco & he always has time for a quick chat & always very polite, #TeamFury #SinceDayOne, all the best Tyson
its so refreshing to see Gary sit these elite athletes down to see whats going on behind the scenes, deserves some serious credit for this YouTube series.
Tyson is a straight liar. Proven time and time again.
As a 27 year old man, Ive been ashamed of people knowing that Im dealing with depression and anxiety as well. On top of that, I got eczema and it affects my mood deeply. Such a vicious cycle. Ive gained 20kg in the past 2 years. Fury's story made me more optimistic about getting better.
Tyson still lying  AJ wants the fight. It's easy to make.
He talks so much shit when it comes to boxing
The Fury haters are sick, they mad now. GO FURY. 💪
Brilliant this what a genuine fella Tyson is
I love fury, real man and he studied Muhammad Ali, heaven sent.
What a interview !!!
Same old g in morcombe  drinking coffee, in trackies and Gucci loafers👀👀👀.
Quality Work Gary, Tyson Fury is the best heavyweight boxer of our generation and most down to earth.
Animation
Big up Tyson and big up all my fellow people working on their mental health
Micah Richards interview needed would be too funny
Tyson fury chats some shit I know that
Very very very good guys 👍🏻🙌🏻
I've always been a tyson fury fan and after watching this i dont understand how some people dont like him, hes one of the most genuine people on this planet
The overlap is the best interview show on YouTube
What an amazing gift for the Gypsy King. Fair do's.
Stick to footballers please Gary 🥴
I fought the best guys in the world in their prime and I'm afraid of this plum 😂😂😂 the big man's brilliant! All the best
God is with Tyson, i love him so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️☦️🙏🏼
Tyson fury is a bull shitter. On the arbitration when he said "all of a sudden" 3 times. It wasnt all of a sudden. His advisors are poop and he knows it. Until he fights wilder on the trilogy he has done no defences of his title. Pulev was 39, povetkin was 37 and klitchko was 41. The only reason klitchko was that old was because fury had kept him out of the ring waiting for a rematch for 18 months. In that time, kltichko had trained HARD. He was in fantastic shape for Joshua. He nearly won it too. That klitchko, as opposed to the gun shy one that fury fought, would have won againsf fury in my opinion. Im looking forward to the next series of fights. It is my belief if the wbc order whyte for who ever wins the trilogy, they get beaten by whyte who is far far better than when he fought joshua.
"alot of people don't know this.... but *********************", "cut that", "i'm not optomistic that the fight will ever happen"
Gary Neville's face when he says he's the only one not doing for the money! 😂
He’s such a genuine fella, just straight up with every question, I like Joshua too but this man is just bang on 💪🏻
Dope fiend glove cheat. Stop abusing PEDs and drugs and maybe he won't have to worry about being depressed.
Tyson Fury is the best ! Deontay Wilder is a... bad word ..:D
He’s on steroids
Fury: I’m obsessed with time Chris Nolan: Yes lad!!
Tyson doesn’t need to do these kind of things OR speak so candidly about his battles.  But he does.  Champ.
Like  your honesty  tyson
Gary asking nearly every single question we as fans want to know. Tyson is such good value too. Even if you don’t like him as a fighter you can’t help but warm to him as a person. Btw I like him as a fighter. Can’t wait for the next one!
Come on the Gary who is winning after speaking to em both
I have absolutely no respect for Tyson. Wilder literally saved this boi life when he gave Tyson a chance to fight. Tyson himself admitted he wanted to kill himself every fucking day. Now he wants to talk about Wilder like this??? Tyson is a an ungrateful ignoramus, in my book.
I think Usyk will beat Joshua which will ruin the Fury fight. But let’s not kid ourselves, Fury’s team screwed up big time on the Fury-Joshua fight.
pretty cool seeing sportsman interview sportsman! There's just that level of understanding. Love this, guys! 🥊⚽
Mental health. Everything Tyson said I’ve had myself. Mad to hear from someone else
Atleast Tyson speaks fluently ......because its from the heart, not all the fake hard man gangster shit that rolls out of Wilder and Joshua
FULL OF SH*T
I'm not in to boxing but that was fantastic, what an incredibly humble guy
Brilliant stuff.
Find this a brilliant interview very moving , had me laughing almost in tears , so humble is Tyson
Why's the Fury got a limp?
Gary this is the best thing i’ve watched in a long time, thank you Tyson & Gary what a fantastic story outlook on life & advice for people to follow
Those bloody shoes 😂🤦‍♂️
Lovely gesture from Neville that. I’m not a Man U fan but that’s some present for a Man U fan like Fury
Great guy, Fury!
Tyson is a great man a honest man the peoples man 🥊🙌🏾👏🏾
Tyson is NOY going to fight Wilder. He's already making excuses. Either way Tyson is going to go back into depression, just watch and see.🤣🤣🤣🤣
Gary delighted to get shot of that Cantona painting
Best heavyweight of this generation – and it's not even close. _Wilder_ will be KO'd again.
You've gotta love this fella
Brilliant viewing. Raw honesty from Fury and Nev's a brilliant interviewer. Looking forward to more of this on the Overlap.
Tyson is a great man very wise and Gary is a good interviewer
Gary Neville is a disgrace to sports journalism. He needs to make a decision, be a journalist and ask follow up questions based facts in the public record. Or be a mouth piece for the rich & famous to gain access. Tyson Fury spouted more crap in this 'interview' than I have ever seen a boxer say. I have never seen a boxer appear on so many television shows & podcasts. He constantly is selling merchandise on the internet. By contrast, how often do you see AJ or Canelo do much media appearances? They are athletes, they are too busy training 24/7. Tyson is a man child incapable taking responsibility for actions. He claimed in this interview he respects Wilder for filing a case against him, and does not respect AJ for setting up the unification fight in Saudi, with this in the background. Bob Arum informed Eddie Hearn on multiple times the Wilder case would not effect the AJ-Fury fight. It was quite revealing when he said a fighter could fight 2 or 3 bums, or get the same amount as fighting him.....wow. That defines most of his career for 5-6 years. Fighting bums. The point at which I gave up on this interview is when he said AJ only fights 40 year olds. Eddie Hearn spent 6 months setting up a fight against him, Tyson Fury, a 32 year old cause he was told he was available for a summer fight. Then he Tyson Fury backs out. What about Parker, Whyte (who Tyson has ducked for yrs), what about the fact that he fought Vlad at 40 as well. Gary Neville should go back to playing football, or just stop calling himself a journalist. I simply do not understand how Tyson Fury has any fans left. Clown, total clown.
God is good 😊
13.44 this is fury talking about himself 💯
Brilliant
Does anyone else think after listening to this that Tyson dropped the match with Joshua?
Says he don’t care about money yet he told Eddie he’s not doing anything unless the money is in his account,this man is soo fall of shit fury is an overrated mug who will not fight AJ dillian whyte or usyk mark my words,these people interviewing fury should bring up shit and the lies furys talks
Gary is the Stephen A Smith of Sky Sports 👍
I hated Gary Neville as a player and his bloody manager. But now when I compare them to the w##kers in football now I really miss them. I remember when Neville gave it to the kop at a really heated north west Derby. He really didn't like them but they loved that. The banter must have been great. Glad he's doing so well as a pundit and interviewer 👍
2 top blokes here… best interview I’ve ever seen or heard… both legends thanks Gary 👍
One of the best interviews I've seen in ages.
15:12 No. It doesn't make sense to me. Because if the WBC champion fights the WBO champion then he becomes the WBC and WBO champion and both organisations would continue to get their cut. Or have I got that wrong?
Fury has weird legs I would like to see him sprint lol
Gary Neville walks like George W Bush.
God works in ways we can never expect, that prayer is what saved his life, and people say there is no God. Having suffered from depression and anxiety myself, I know exactly what Tyson is describing,  and I have to say that when I found God again in my life it was a turning point. I have a disability which means I spend long periods of the day by myself, but I now know I am not by myself, as God is there looking over my shoulder. I have nothing but the utmost respect for Tyson, he will only help others by opening up and telling the world the depths he fell to, before becoming the man he is now!!
Gary Neville is a mug Fury's literally lying to him say Joshua only fights old guys and Neville just asks the next question rather than saying that's not accurate. Fury could stand there and say the sky's yellow and Neville wouldn't bat an eyelid
TYSON FRAUD FURY
I rate Tyson but he chats shit. He announced the AJ fight on his insta! Contradicts himself silly.
quality vid, Tyson is great and good interviewing Gary
It’s delusional people think fury is scared of AJ he’s more at risk with wilder with that punchers chance I don’t even want fury to fight wilder again because he could lose there’s a good chance just with that bat wilder has
Wbc Ibf wbo wba ring magazine world champion he never lost his belts he got rob of the belts tyson fury is the true world champion
I really like Tyson Fury but there's something about his wife *THAT I JUST DON'T LIKE.*
Tyson is inspiring, open and honest. Brilliant.
What a guy, for a big tough champion boxer he is very open about his feelings and his weaknesses. Inspiring from Fury
The NW has TF the NE has “Ginger Ninja”DrD ! Best finish in GreatNorthRun top 400 , plays midfield & has 2 excellent young footballing sons , great dancer & pop quiz genius ! Watch & share a warrior for warriors ✌️ https://youtu.be/4E2zAUsdSK8
Tyson you and your dad lie 😂😂😂
Two greats …. Both successful in everything they do …
For someone who moves so well in the ring, Fury looks slightly knock kneed and walks awkwardly.
There are more comments here about how good of an interviewer Gary is then how big of a joke tyson is and that is good. For Fury.
Amazing interview . Can't wait to see fury smash wilder again. Gary is a top interviewer
Why did i start Liking him more now
This man is the big friendly giant
Absolutely love the honesty from Tyson Mental Health is a nasty illness 🤒
Look at the guy in the back at 31:22 pretending to take a pic of his wife so he could snap Gary and Tyson
Fury lies to himself so often you'd swear it was golden truth when it leave his mouth 🤣 gotta love fury think he practices these delusional quotes in the mirror 🪞
If there's one thing to learn from this it's don't trust what Fury says...... He himself said the contract signed and the AJ fight was ready to go then a day later Wilders arbitration ruling happened. Even after "Bullshit Bob" Arum saying "the arbitration wasn't a problem, it's for money and not a fight"
Bet he was just trying to get rid of that shite painting. Here you go tyson. Call to wife after "it's done".
The thing is - the societal system is based around making you unhappy, so you buy into there shit to falsely believe it will make you happy - but of course it wont, that void is forever there and you move onto the next shitty thing that gives you a sense of success - they drip feed us. Sad really - depression is at the highest its ever been at right now and thats for the youth - man the youth have their whole life ahead of them, they shouldn't be depressed - evil satanic system we live in.  Rememebr guys - happiness is defined by people you dont even know. Happiness doesn't exist because the basics us humans need isnt enough anymore.
He wouldn't be a popular choice with the higher ups at most charities, but the work he has done by just discussing his mental health issues is immense.   While boxing has leveled him out, he should be proud of the work he's done just promoting the issues using the platform he has. I can't think of anyone else in that Kind of a position who has contributed more by just opening up.
I wonder why he keeps trying to pull out the fight
I like fury but I don't believe a word of his story. I think he knows what his team did. Its about making as much cash as possible hence the dillian fight.
You can see the guy is more thruthfull and direct than the other side, no hate just real talk AJ, stop the buisness man charachter in boxing be a fighter and do good buisness besides the cameras. humble opinion
Gaz great interviewer but they need to stop using Ajs name as click bait as though they are beefing, literally on every interview and it's getting old! And I need a list of the best fighter's in the world that fury fought in their prime¿? Furys great but Aj has the best resumé in the current heavyweight division and has for a while, so fury stop trying to put a claim to that lol it looks daft son - but only the casual fans won't know that!
Nobody cares
How bout fight Whyte, joe Joyce , Joshua , or even defend “ 1 belt “
Tyson rury is the nicest more genuine boxr hope him Joshua end up fighting mabe defend it once or this uv done feal everything theres is in boxing whatu since d very early days when u had d long curly hair smashing every1 to bits god bless tyson bid fan from cork city ireland👍
Gary Neville has found what he’s good at
its admirable to live in a normal house & send your kids to a normal school, refusing to live it large for the sake of your children when you have wealth, not many would do it. He's at ease with being vulnerable in a sport that's all about bravado. Gary has got himself a good series going.
Tyson is genuinely the real deal.
Great interview but next time can we see  what shoes they are wearing?
This series is awesome, Gary is just so good at this! What a fantastic gift(Closet United fan)
this is what i like in Tyson Fury, he never hesitates to share his faith and he knows the one above is Jesus..
Struggled to keep up with the bullshit and contradictions in this one
Fair play Gary these have all been very good
Very inspiring. Respect Tyson💪🏾
This was such a well shot video man
This is depression, too many people today feel down or fed up or have a bad day and straight away it's depression. Too many people use the phrase I'm depressed, they don't know what real depression is.
Money doesn't give happiness 🙂, really hope whyte gets to fight against fury and wilder he deserves it
Wilder 3 fight will b intresting
What a Guy Tyson Fury is! Incredible story and genuine person! We need more professional athletes and celebrities to speak more open about their health/mental health❤️
Superb from both if these guys.. Absolutely tremendous 👏
3 years out the ring, yeah two of them was because he was band for cheating.
Tyson is a genuine man. I respect anyone who gets in the ring and is open and honest about his mental health and being vulnerable
AJ’s resume is the best in the HW division. Which says a lot about the current HW division.  I do think Fury will win though.
Gary what a gift by the way
Gary borrowed his mrs’ jacket?
Being 38,this is easily the most honest upfront answers I have ever seen from a sportsman,so refreshing to see and hear a famous person being straight to the point.
You can always rely on fury to talk crap  80 million if I don’t fight wilder.  this guy  dose not want any  part of aj.
Dont you just love Tyson :)
I don't care about money.....errrr I would of lost 80 million if I don't fight Wilder. So what is Fury? Plus did you ever give all your fight purse to the homeless?
Needs to move on from the same old mental health story. We've all been there, life goes on.
Gary Neville aka Mr Sky Sports 👑
Great interview , Tyson is a wise Intelligent guy ✊brill
Adverts are a joke.
love fury!
Wilder disliked this video 234 times so far
Ha Gary looks tiny 😄
Great interview....particularly because of the things he's saying. He's not just addressing mental health and suicide, but talking honestly about his own demons. He's living and fighting in front of the world. In the words of Ali "I'm a bad man"...this guy is bad and a truly important individual because of the power to do good that he possesses. How many people in life influence in such a good way?
Tyson's biggest opponent was himself. He beat his inner demons and conquered the world. I love this guy. What a man. Inspirational.
what a great interview and what a great man I absolutely love Tyson and all he's achieved
no matter the race, you have to looooooooooove Tyson Fury..  Great Champ.. nothing but love from your fellow black American fan..  the man is just so dayum cool.
I’m definitely not cut out for being at the level of fame as Tyson. The people following him with phones out annoyed me. 😂😤
Tyson by ko or late stop, wilder is a big doster
Gary keeps getting better and better with these interviews. When is he getting Cantona or McGregor on it
I like Tyson for mental health reasons, I like the way he talks about mental health and he’s a role model for that but I just can’t believe him when you talks about boxing, he cares about money, he’s said it himself before.. he doesn’t fight the best (if you can name 5 fighters of good standing let me know) he knew wilder hadn’t fought anyone good and would get beat off anyone in the top 10, that’s why wilder ducked AJ and povetkin for years, hence why he took that fight, it was the perfect play to get a world title back. And if boxing is all he ever wanted to do, why’s he doing wwe and not had a title defence? I know the first time was for mental health reasons so I understand that but he’s been the champ since 2019… like come on 🤷🏻‍♂️… he won’t fight Joshua because he don’t want to get beat, simple as
Tyson stinks of raw honesty.  It's a very powerful attribute.
What an inspirational fella, top man nice one Tyson
Yes he would be happy living in a council flat and don't care about money while standing on a beach with versace shoes on ha ha ha Total BS as usual
There’s no way that Tyson dodged AJ in any shape or form, AJ is a fraud.
Gary neville wants to restructure the universe
There's only one Tyson Fury
Absolutely cracking interview again, thank you.  Also… what a shocker of a painting lol my word 🤣
I love freakin TYSON FURY  The true CHAMP 🥊👊🏾👏🏽👍🏾
I love the sport of boxing but I really love Tyson and his wife Paris. They are real people, down to earth, proper and money and fame clearly hasn’t changed either of them
TYSON FURY THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME. LONG LIVE THE GYPSY KING 👑
Whan an interview, Tyson has definitely changed a lot of lifves with his comeback nd sharing his story with the world...
You didn’t fight anyone in there prime apart from paper champion wilder you just got lucky cause your the first one to get klitscho during the end of his reign who happened to be “40-odd “ Something year old get a reality check
I understand Tyson with anxiety and depression i used to have panic anxiety attacks daily I’m 6/3 and 19 stone and it’s crazy how it attacks you the way it do I didn’t want to live my self but this man has helped me soo much makes you realise your not alone on this and keep fighting 💪
1:20m bruh wore fresh white new kicks to a beach
I’d offload that print as well! 🤣
Fury makes me laugh mentions a few fighters of age Joshua has fought why has he not got in the ring with any of the fighters mentioned apart from klitschko then? Unbelievable talker done well to get into this position with his mouth 😂
No wonder Gary is giving that Cantona art away! 🤣🤣😂👍🏼
His knees looked buckled.. I've seen this before with him, his knees collapse in.. I wonder if its his hips/lower back and he has problems with them.. Great boxer though
Very disingenuous guy, the money does not matter - but I have $100m.  Bring the IG reciepts
That's why he's the best a normal fella who you could talk to about anything a top bloke unlike a manufactured boxer
Even in our happiest moments its not complete cos it can only be complete through Christ and heaven.   We broke Gods law (adultery,lying, thieving, fornicators, murderers) Jesus paid the fine- thats what happened on that cross   And we are gonna live forever but we need to repent of sin and trust in Jesus 🪂 to be saved or face Gods prison in hell because hes not gonna force you be with him in eternity cos that isnt love.

THE best sports interview EVER !
I like Tyson, but he contradicts himself so much it's unreal. It's like he has multiple personalities and everyone loves one of them but not the others. Sometimes I love him, sometimes he seems like a dick.
Class interview
More this please! Superb
mad respect for tyson fury
It's easy to live in the moment when you don't need to worry about money 💰
16:07 same as mike tyson and lennox lewis
He has lost a fight. Lost in the amateurs at least twice.
He said they were trying to set this fight up since they were 22... Aj didn't even turn pro until he was 24. They done the gloves are off heavyweights was made that year and there was no talk of AJ vs fury until fury returned in 2018.   I like fury but he chats a lot of horse manure.
Maybe Fury should get a better team who doesn't muck about with setting up fights
This was needed, I could watch Garry and Tyson talk all day
Best men in their prime? Klitschko was well past his best when both Fury and Joshua beat him. Who else has he beaten in their prime? Wilder has never had a prime. His best win was outboxing an average stiverne for the WBC title.
All that about how he'd be happy living on a council estate is a load of crap. If that's the case I'm sure he could find someone who would swap bank accounts with him.
This man is such a inspiration. Him and lebron are the 2 pillars for me in sports. I’m so enamored with his story. It’s incredible.
Cracking interview by a very well rounded interviewer. Good job Gary.  Hats off to Tyson spoke very openly about everything. A true inspiration to people.
Best interview with a boxer ever, completely relaxed and honest. No hype, no showmanship, just a good chat.
Tyson calls out other fighters for being business men just wanting to make money...Yet he was the one messing around with WWE just for the extra fame and pay check loool
state of those shoes 🤣 sound big geezer tho
He knew that court case was happening so why did he even take the Joshua fight, loves to push blame
Hes such a lier about the money
Gary the little guy Neville. <3
Great conversation, Gary is really good and being balanced towards hard subjects, like mental health. Keep Gary on these he's good
Although the cameraman kept homing in on the shoes, I bet he didn't say anything!
Wtf was not in is prime . You also beat the old Klitschko this guy one best liars in the boxing history
Tyson best boxer ever, and Gary's a good man
Gary Neville: so Tyson,Why Morecambe??  Tyson: 🎵 “A long,long time ago..” 🎶
Tyson Fury chatting more shite for 40 mins, expect nothing less from this fraud
Great interview, entertaining pair. If you haven't seen it check out Tyson Fury on Joe Rogan 👌
That Bay looks stunning
Biggest inspiration in boxing. With all the fake clowns in his division, he really is a breath of fresh air!
He’s so full of waffle and contradiction 😂
Could listen to Tyson all day he actually talks a lot of sense
Never defended your title ,all you do is talk shit.Hasn't fought anyone.. What funny is most white people believe you,  what does that say about them.
Brilliant interview ( you're good at this Gary ) I love Tyson's  honesty and spontaneity ( especially when he speaks about mental health ) Tyson's obsession with time may have been the root of all his mental health problems. He said he always wanted to be able to control time. The problem is that he wanted to be in " control ". Now he says he is happy to let God be in control. This is the key to his true objective, which is happiness. Happiness is just another word for contentment. We will all have moments of happiness but also moments of sadness. True contentment is accepting both with equal grace. Kudos to Tyson for recognising, and validating, the strength of the exceptionally good woman he has in his life, Paris.
I want to puke , Fury is a shtta
Following Gary for a while. Brilliant interview style.  Great stuff
What an interview that is 👌👏
Best one yet Neville
I like Joshua but I fucking love Tyson Fury
Better come back story than Kim Kardashians.
. Aj doesnt want to fight? Your team back out . And yout being real? Eddie knew about case court because you told it has been sorted on your ends but you didn't and top of that you made announcement its happening and your saying aj team is scared of you who is the chicken?
That was great! Gary lovely gesture giving Tyson that very personal picture of one of his hero’s Eric. I’ve got to say it, I really like Tyson and the open honest that comes across when he speaks. I really wish him the best for the fight against Wilder, but more importantly for the rest of his life and that he finds that peace and tranquillity that for do long he just couldn’t find. Life’s about the good and the bad and embracing each moment as a lesson to be learned from. Keep throwing that honesty out there because it’ll draw people into you even more who will warm to that vulnerability from someone so iconic in tough sport. You may not realise it completely, but speaking out so opening about your psychological problems will be a comfort to so many who are going through the same things, but can’t vocalise it.  You’re a Champion mate, and not just in a sporting sense and I wish you well for the future.
the goat
i feel gary could have asked or done more to cut through some ambiguous and contradictory things here
I only have one question, if Aj and his team didn’t want the fight how did they knew to start negotiations, are they telepathic. Surly they had to have spoken  to your team . You were there one who said the clock was ticking, we all remember the Twitter posting,  you were running out of time. And you specifically spoke to the Saudi Prince who confirm the finds . As Aj said they could have said, look we have this arbitration with Wilder just wait until it was over instead of playing the fan . Even now the ticket sales for the third fight isn’t sold out . This seem to be another opportunity to use Aj name to promote this fight no one wants to see. This man tell so much lies you can’t believe anything that comes out of his mouth. Can you imagine if Aj and his team had fail. Fury, Bob Arum an Frank would have crucified Aj and Eddie Hearn,  Instead they are the ones on the defensive and having to make excuses. They are the one who didn’t want the fight they just fought Eddie  could get it done and they wanted to embarrass him .
I'm sorry  but when it comes to his so called mental health issues I'm calling bullshit, where's the proof that he suffered. Now what I do think is the reason he said he had so calld mental health issues is if he'd went infront of the committee and stated he was addicted to drink and drugs no way in hell would he have been given his license back. So I genuinely think he made all this Bs mental health issues up as a way to get his boxing licence back as could blame his "mental" health issues for his drink and drug addiction. Also as for Aj not fighting any legit heavyweight..can anyone name 10 top 10 heavyweights that Fury has beaten ..because as it stands there's only 2 klitschko and wilder
When he was standing and singing in the corner while beating Klitschko. Man what a beast!
This guys good at talking, but for all his charming speech, why does he never defend a title, big fan of his character but disappointed as a boxing fan. Come Fury just defend your belt before you retire.
Tyson Fury’s last 18 months: not a single fight, shit ton of talking; Mike Tyson’s first 18 months: 28 fights, not a single word, becomes heavyweight champion;  Just some statistics…
I Went on the piss one night in Belfast and spent the night partying with Tyson and Hughie. About 9 years ago. And my god the man is the exact same in real life as he is on tv. The confidence he spoke with just made me know he would be one of the greatest. What a legend
Proper present that, respect to Gary 👍🏻
Need a subtitle
the shoes! xDD
Tyson looking in phenomenal shape
Thank you Gary for an amazing interview.  80 million  arbitration case? Holy fuq! All you Wilder fans watch how Fury describes the punching power of Your boy. No denial. No excuses. No bullshit.  Fury will be taking your boy’s head.
Brilliant interview.Tyson is a breath of fresh air. Honest, humble and down to earth.Love him
Love Fury but hes fought 2 good fighters deyonce and Klitschko.
Now Tyson out here coping plea's now, smh. It's too laaaaaattttteeeee.
TYSON A UNITED FAN . IF THT WAS CARRAGHER HED B CHATTING SHIT LIKE ALL LIVPOOL FANS
Dressing up as batman😭 legend
Literally said the complete opposite two days ago about everything.
Top interview by Gary one of the best ones I’ve seen an Tyson is the Top man respect ✊
Furys amazing
Great content, thanks
Much respect for Tyson’s wife… the real GOAT
Joe Rogan needs to have him back after the Wilder rematch
18 pints has gotta be 3000+ calories. No wonder he was 400 lbs
Lol he's lieing he's a FRAUD yous all delusional was all self inflicted through cocaine an booze let's all go get off our nuts an get sympathy yeah makes sense imagine taht, being someone like josh off sniffing an boozing up haha 👀😅🤣🙈
Fury " I fought all the best fighters in there prime" he's only fought two top 10 fighters in his whole career!
This guy is a absolute idiot, he thinks Aj & fury are bigger than 20 billion dollar television networks & they can just fight in eddies back yard & tell Espn & fox & BT & sky to f off. You can tell Tyson got annoyed explaining it to him.
Doesn't change the fact he's gone 1 year and 7 months without defending a title, yet again
Tysons honesty is just so refreshing. He’s so down to earth considering how rich he is
Tyson a real life super Hero  the Gypsy king 🥊 👑 🥊
Never seen him this fit.
Top interview but why is Gary packing?
I like.
Someone tell fat boy to be in shape. I'm betting on him. And I love him. Better be a good fight with all this drama.
Their all businessmen I’m a fighter, says the guy who signed the ESPN 65 million deal lol
There’s only one Tyson Fury
Actually can't believe all the comments to this lol U ppl lap up furys bullshit.. How he says half this shit with a straight face is remarkable.. Whats even funnier is how many of u lap it up 🤣🤣
Every boxers favourite saying is levels, well this is all about levels and AJ will never be on fury’s level, conversation over
Around 25:59 talking about being out on his own in morecambe weatherspoons on his own on halloween, sobering up for a second thinking wtf was he doing there.. imagine if he was dressed as a pumpkin or something hahaha
everyone in Morecambe are so chill, they don't seem to mind Tyson Fury and Gary strolling around the town, imagine doing this in Lodon, all the idiots will flock them with selfies
Great format for interview, very relaxed and real, not forced. Gary does a great job in controlling the conversation. So far been very impressed with the content from The Overlap!!!
Legend fury always number 1, what a story.
Superb interview.
Fury speaking about being a Christian is very refreshing in the woke LGBT age
Well done, Tyson. You speak for so many people 👍
Brilliant! - from a Liverpool supporter! Excellent interview from Neville and Tyson seems good with the world. Love the honesty, Go smash Wilder and end that chapter once and for all.
I'm not about money but the reason the fight didn't happen in covid was because you wouldn't make any money because of no fans this guy makes no sense
Sound guy
Enjoyed that about 1 million percent more than the AJ one
So many Tyson fans what a fraud story ever since he was batterd by John McDermott and looked after by the referee what a joke furthermore a j has a resume 10 times better than fury fact who has fury fought in his prime zefa zeferi Otto wallin pienetta Cunningham 😂😂😂 the public need to wise up this is a through and through liar
I wonder if that tin of happy shopper peas I gave him is up in the gym 🤔
Whatever the reason for the fight happening, it's def not because Fury is afraid, he's too insane to be afraid tbh.
I am not a Manchester united fan am a Chelsea fan and Gary isn't in ma top 50 soccer plays but Gary jus made me like him for how he executes his interviews it is brilliant... But let me quickly say here that I think Fury will loose to Wilder in the 3rd rematch and u all will be stunned. Also I would like to make one last request, Gary pls interview Deontay Wilder next jus as u interviewed Fury after Aj do the same for Wilder after Fury. I think I and alot of ppl r interested and curious to see how Wilder responds and counter some of the things Fury said bout him here. 🙏🙂👍
Gary is fast forging a reputation as a decent interviewer. The best interviewers are happy to let the interviewee lead the way and know when to get out of the way and let the person talk without interruption. Top stuff again Gaz!
Wilder reached out his hand and helped u. How did you repay him? U tried to con him out of the trilogy. Don't miss your execution 10/09.
Tyson Fury really is a cool ass dude fr
Being a newcastle fan I used to hate Gary and used to find tyson annoying before he opened up about his struggles. That has to be one of the best interviews I have seen well done Gary and for a man like Tyson to open up about mental health is amazing the big fella is literally saving lives. 3 and 0 against wilder comming up. He did not draw that first fight.
I got my first anxiety attack in bed a few days ago, weird he mentioned it, I feel better already and more understanding of it
Craig Bellamy has a head with no neck
“You fought the best in the world in their prime…” ??? Gary might believe it…doubt it but, no one other than your most infatuated fan girls do…you’ve been tumbled Feary…you’re a ducker…! 🦆🦆🦆
This man is a true inspiration to me
Nobody can beat this man. Special special boxer.
Next fight Wilder.  Then AJ.  Then what?..... Well, Mike Tyson said the other day Tyson Fury is a good mate but if the money is right,he'll have a go 😳
This is something that everyone should watch, he really is one of the most inspirational people alive and gives out so much wisdom and great advice
Go Paris xxx
This was hard to watch... Mental health is no joke... Tysons a warrior for not only over coming it but becoming a champion ontop of it!
🐐
I’d love that painting!
I love the man
The tense non verbal negotiations of when to stop and start walking are nail biting
I love this guy so much 😊
I suffer from Mental Illness and Tyson Fury is a big inspiration for me.
Good old Morecambe bay. Another good interview. Great series..
This contradicts Joshua's mis-information. Fact: Deontay contract (time to request a 3rd fight) had expired. Tyson was legally free to fight Joshua which Tyson went for. Fact: Wilder than files a lawsuit after the dead line and a weak , incompetent, or corrupt $$$ USA judge grants the 3rd fight which was contrary to the contract and law.  Fact: In the USA if you are sued and you do not defend yourself you automatically lose. Even if you win the lawsuit, that lawsuit can be appealed and dragged in the courts for years. Wilder's team played dirty. Tyson's best option was to fight Wilder.  Joshua's legal team always knew the real story but has been acting slimy. Best thing for Tyson to do: Bull doze Wilder and then Bull doze Joshua.
Sky have put a great team together with Gary. The shooting, editing, and overall content is A-1.
Absolutely brilliant interview….. that’s the most honest I’ve heard from Tyson and yes your the best of your era …….. Mr fury pleas fight AJ and soon …… that will cement your legacy xx
Tyson Fury is so interesting and so refreshingly honest in a world of bullshitters.  Great interview.  I don't like the coming up teasers or the interruptions by YouTube for adverts but apart from that fantastic.
This man a legend and a great role  model  given what hes been through and his honesty about it and the credit he gives his wife  is admarable
So many people taking comfort and inspiration from his words. Yet he is so naturally humble that he thinks the only thing he is good at is boxing?
why are we still listening to what this guy says when he cheated all his career by altering his gloves , ..but  that wasn`t enough for beat wilder so he decided to spike he`s water as well ...pretty disgusting
Mickey Theo V John Fury on Morecambe bay #fightingman
Love you Tyson awesome when you can to Cleethorpes
WAAAAIIIIIT! I saw Tyson in his gym in some video earlier, and was wondering why the HELL he had a portrait of Eric Cantona in there.
Love him his an absolute champion
Why does Neville look like Frank Ribery today?
Those shoes on the beach ⛱
Great interview
brilliant yet again gary,tyson  one nice guy
Best thing sky has done Gary is amazing at this
Tyson fury speaks the truth what a guy he is
He's full of lies he claims to be from Manchester everytime he fights the ring announcer says he's from outside Manchester morecambe is no where near manchestet
Not a single overlap has disappointed yet but this is by far the best! Gary is so good at letting people speak whilst also getting everything out of people
He talks for 10mins about how the Joshua fight won't happen then Gary asks who will he fight after Wilder........AJ. You gotta love him!
Brilliant interview 👏
🤝🤝🤝👍👍👍
The badly bullshitter blag merchant.  Got beaten up by Otto Wellin.  Big time.   Stop talking about AJ just to sell tickets to a scrap no one wants to see. .
Tyson spooked he running!
those shoes though...
3 weeks before his fight and now he wants to entertain the Joshua fight to sell his weak ass fight.
Respect Tyson Fury for coming back and being honest
This channel is great. Top interview.
Likable Fury but oh he lies a lot. Actually parse what he says and you’d realize the duplicity. Same Fury said age is only a number now he says AJ fights men in their 40s. Only Klitchko was 40 when he fought AJ. Not Povetkin, Pulev, Dillian, Charles Martin or Parker. He says he doesn’t believe AJ wants the fight even after Eddy got the fight sealed. Imagine what this Fury would have said if Eddy failed to deliver the fight (something they hoped for)? Let’s not get carried away by this liar who weaponized Covid. Don’t be a victim of sentimental amnesia. Y’all must have forgot.   PS…Respect to him for winning his mental battles though.
Absolutely superb, thats the real tyson
Boxing is all politics ,no place for a straight  shooter like tyson
Fury, the walking contradiction.  Full of absolute shite
Love Tyson. How can you not like him? Believes in his ability. Banters AJ but still says he respects him and it makes light of it. Plus he made the greatest comeback ever.  Fury > AJ
Ughh the mental story again ! I was depressed fat , over and over again nuff man enough
Anxiety is horrendous.  I get it every day. Makes me not want to leave the house. I talk myself into panicking.
I used to work for a hedge fund, and what he says about unhappy rich people is so true. I worked for people worth hundreds of millions, and a few in the billions, and they all seemed absolutely miserable. The only ones who seemed happy were the ones who were very rich, but not so rich that it became their entire identify. The ones who were worth several million, where they can afford an extremely nice house, a holiday house, first class travel etc...they seemed happy. Beyond that, it looked like more of a burden than anything else.
Fury is full of shit such a conman which is a shame cos he’s elite boxer but a chronic liar
Hang on a minute didn't John fury say he should have taken the aj fight??? But aj backed out ? Not adding up here
"I just got married , my family and her family started fighting" that's as gypsy as it gets 🤣🤣
Gary Neville walking like R2-d2
The Gypsy King 🤴🏼
You could have the greatest network and people in the world but depression is like a block to all the positives you have in your life. To come back from that level is amazing.
I really don't approve of his shoes.
Phenomenal!!!
Love this man
Credit to Neville. What a great honest interview. Tyson is so open and down to earth, it's like grilling one of the lads.
Good interview.
This overlap series is going to take off, love them
Fair play neville is top enjoyed this one
When I first knew of Tyson about 10 years ago,  I really didn't like like him, I thought he was full of bullshit and disrespectful to everyone but, he has become a real inspiration to me and now I really respect him as a person and a boxer. Win, lose or draw in whatever you do, Tyson, you are a truly great man.
Gary looks tiny at side of Tyson
Great interview !
Absolutely loved this 👌 and you can tell these two really like each other
Why is Gary Neville walking like he's hard as nails next to Tyson Fury who's strolling with a pair of giant Wasps on his feet?
Neville is a natural at interviewing I will say that
Tyson  I don’t need a flash house or car for ppl to like me  Tyson I was gonna drive my farrari into a bridge  Also Tyson has a different Versace robe for every day of the week   Get the Fuk outa here
Why has Tyson got a pair of size 15 wasps on his feet?
Funny that aj has the better resume than fury lmao
Tyson Fury full of sh1t, he dont want that AJ smoke. What a waste of 40 minutes! Tyson Fury STFU!
17:07 Fury calls Gary "Roy" 🤣🤣🤣
Tyson Fury admitted again for like the 10th time Wilder literally koed him in the first fight lmao
Easy to say you’ll never lose when you never fight anyone.
Amazing looking at the comments how many people are inspired by Tyson and his mental health journey like me. He explains it perfectly and makes you feel like a person again. Sometimes listening to him makes me tearful I wish I could of helped him. Weird really
Such a lovely guy! God bless Tyson
“I’ve beaten the best in there prime”….🤔 who exactly
Could listen to fury all day absolutely brilliant interview this was
Excellent interview Gary and what a guy Tyson is!
These interviews are so good just feels like a casual chat. Tyson Fury what a character he is no acting just being himself 👍
You announced the fight !! But you didn’t back out ??
Tyson if you don't fight AJ your legacy will be stained with "yeah but he never fought AJ". Don't let history have that sentence.
#GOAT 👑👑👑
Didn't Fury say Wilder wanted 20 million dollars to step aside back in May? All of a sudden it's 80 million.  Edit: it was sarcastic, he did say it.
Do people actually believe anything he actually says ???
hes like the other tyson in the sense that being humbled has brought out the best in him🥊.. as someone of faith, to see God @work through these mighty warriors is beyond inspiring and the wisdom these open books of men brings to people is needed now more than ever 🌬.. glory to God 🕊
Gary Neville stirring shit between the 2 best heavyweight boxers on the planet.   Got his snout in everything.    One minute he's commentating, then punditing, then chairmen of a football club, then backroom staff with england, then buildimg hotels, then helping homeless, then his snouts in the ESL, then interfering with fan debates and now his nosey nose is in the middle of heavyweight boxing.  I'm not sure whether to admire his work ethic or blast him in that nosey nose of his.   I don't know whether i like him or want to fight him.   I don't know whether he's a creature of greed or a hard working man who cares.   Probably all the above.    He'll probably be at my door deliverimg Domino's Pizza's by weekend so i better watch what i say.
0:28 Parker? Ruiz? Usyk?
I’ll fight him on here now n flatten him
Yo G.Nevz is a good interviewer 💥 Man U!
Two legends. Love them both. ❤️
This guy chats some shit 😂😂
Fairs fair? It’s only fair because he’s American and a yank judge made the decision. Says it all.
Hope wilder beats him he talks so much shit these days
Does anyone know where that shirt is available that Tyson is wearing ?
Tyson fury is the man and everyone who no's boxing will agree, why didn't joshua go after wilder and become undisputed champ but fury did after years out  and was a fat basterd. The man's a living legend who doesn't get the respect from the mainstream media but the avarage man loves him
You box no one you lie !
Garys lying. He's got another picture away somewhere or that one wasn't is. No way am I giving a picture like that away, willy nilly.
BILLIONAIRES ARE MISERABLE.
More boxers on overlap please sky
Tyson Fury is a prophet. If wisdom was a currency, he would be a wealthy man. If wisdom was a currency...
Looking forward to Fury's interview next week saying the exact opposite of everything he's said here.  The man is full of nonsense.
Great interview. Especially coming from a footballer. Congrats Gary
great interview. anyone know where Tysons' shirts from?
Makes me so proud to be British Tyson a true gentleman a true legend of the sport love this guy he is the true king boxing what a geezer good luck Sir!x
We want another one
Well done TYSON.. nice chap..
Paris is defiantly the making or breaking of him like most men
What an interview 👏 👌
35:10 "What I say I wanna be sounds very simple but its probably the hardest  thing that can ever exist... I just want to be happy. "  That's a profound statement right there.
Great interview, can't wait for your next one gary!
Jesus christ gary youre 40 odd, wtf are you doing in those jeans???
He's twice as big as Gary
All the salty AJ fans in the comments, he’s not going to shag you.
fury has not fought that many greats in their prime
This man is an absolute legend. I'd love to get the chance to speak with him
Fury is afraid of AJ its as simple as that
So he doubted the AJ fight was happening while he was saying "Dan the Man has sorted it", then announcing it himself on Twitter literally the day before it was called off? He's great to listen to and I like his interviews, but you can't say he never contradicts himself 🤷🏻‍♂️
Great interview. Really enjoying this series and this is the best one yet. Hoping Tyson smashes Wilder and we manage to get the Joshua fight next year. I will definitely be rooting for Tyson.
fury is the realist boxer in the game!
Like always Tyson fury brilliant charismatic because is only one Tyson fury
fury will lose against aj and i like fury
Great interview with good clear commentary. 👏🏻  TF is the best of his era. Undefeated x 2 time world heavyweight champion, WBC and The Ring magazine titles since defeating Deontay Wilder in 2020; previously the unified WBA, IBF, WBO, IBO, and The Ring titles after defeating Wladimir Klitschko in 2015.   1, T. FURY - Undefeated  2, A. JOSHUA - 1 Loss  3, J. JOYCE - Undefeated  4, D. Whyte - 2 Losses  5. A. USYK - Undefeated 6. D. Wilder - 1 Loss    Joe Joyce potentially beats them all accept TF. TF would beat JJ on points.   Good-luck TF for DW 3 💥🥊
“I’ll fight Joshua anywhere, any place, any time, but let me fight wilder another 4 times and let me have 5 more tune up fights”
About time :)
Tyson fury is an absolute legend in and out of the ring
Fury is avoiding aj it's obvious.
Gary neville & tyson fury my favourite sports personalitys......love you both such an honest interview with # tyson.
I still think hes lying about anthony joshua but i still love Furu !
maybe i'm overthinking it but the fact they done an extended interview with AJ and mentioned the Fury fight alot and done vice versa with Tyson Fury might indicate Joshua might stay with Sky and all of this is early promotion for the undisputed fight.
Klitschko was right about him being bipolar
get it champ
Thousandth comment
Seems to me that Sky Sports are promoting Fury more than AJ. It's not like AJ's got a fight next week.
Excellent interview Gary neville, tyson fury thank you for a honest open interview.
What a nice chap! Both of them.
man, he got in better shape REAL QUICK!? hmmmmmm, i wonder....
Gary Neville walks kind of like a severe piles sufferer.
Fury is getting knocked tf out Oct 9th....if he even shows. He's yet to defend any of his belts so wouldn't put it past him. #bombzquad
I will believe this man when he beats AJ and Whyte but until then it's just rubbish all of it.
Such a great interview. Felt super genuine. As a walk talker myself I really got into the interview. Thank you!
This man will SMOKE AJ
The Best Boxer and Performer. We love you Tyson!
Tyson your explanation of mental health issues is extremely accurate! Thank you  you are a  Brilliant speaker! 👏
Fury is  huge fuck going in the ring wae him 😂😂😂
Stayed at a B&B at Morecombe 1989 .... loved the place  .
Thanks for the inspiration to sort my mental health
Fury is so honest. I teared up slightly when he was talking about his wife at the end. What an insightful guy. Know thyself eh?
Seriously… no disrespect to all the ponces out there or anything. But based on the comment section Im gathering its a MentalHealthathon ??? Is it???  🤦🏻‍♂️
He's a bit bonkers, but really likeable
I’ll pay to watch Fury every time. Talented, entertaining killer.
Gary 'sounds like me that' Neville
The difference between Fury and Joshua, Fury talks to Neville like a mate on a gentle stroll on the beach, Joshua talks to Neville like a PR/marketing man. As a LFC supporter I think Neville is a f..king fantastic interviewer.
Best of luck Tyson❤️💯💪🇮🇪😎
Brilliant
Love his personality and his story but he is  actually what he calls other a big dosser . He dodged  AJ and he is still making excuses he had a contract with another useless boxer Deontay then asked Hearn to negotiate the fight and then walked away. AJ never made excuses when he lost, another lie peddled by the big dosser.
Thank you for this! Gain a lot more admiration and respect for Tyson Fury
So glad this series came along. Loved fore hole challenge with tubes, but he’s turned into dick van dyke with all the non stop Cockney rhyming slang. Puts me right off. Well done Garry 👏🏻
Tysons footwear is having a lot of screen time
I dout Wilder will get 30m $ from that fight. Neither will Fury. Infact no one will earn more than 7m $ from that fight
He messed Anthony Joshua around. All the lies and dancing around the truth can't change that fact. If you knew that you had the rematch why bang on about the fight with Anthony and blame them at every turn for it not moving forwards when it's all on your side where the blockages are happening?  Absolutely clear that he used Anthony Joshua to get attention and hype for his boring third fight with Wilder that no one cares about.
The slow-mo of the seagull at the start got me
Tyson Fury is a great lier and a great guy
I love Tyson Fury, but to say Joshua doesn't want the fight is BS, getting so tired of this rhetoric. Just get the fight made, Boxing needs it!
Loved this. Brilliant interview. Top man Tyson
Got to give a shout out to Morcombe. Absolutely stunning
Gary these walks are amazing
I can confirm that Tyson was never an alcoholic because I’ve a few friends that were properly addicted to alcohol and none of them after giving up could ever drink socially again for the rest of their lives end of story
loved the video, tyson good luck with the fight \o/ will be watching so honest, ps i used to work delivering linen to garys hotel at old trafford  pay your staff more money with the money you saved not getting the round in lol great video so chilled :)
Looks in good shape
Thanks Tyson I’ve been struggling with mental health for years your story and how you’ve explained how you felt is inspiring to me like you one day I’d love to be happy 👊🏻❤️
Fury - “in his last fight when he got smashed by a little fat lad” - Literally 3 fights ago. Love the selective memory. Sure he’s got dementia. Poor bloke has no end of issues. 🙏
Awesome stuff, loved it!
Tyson "The Lying King" Fury. Fury you said you were ready to fight and arum said the arbitration wouldn't be an issue.
2 top blokes 👌👍
He should put his money where his mouth is... Boot the belt away like he said, and then make the AJ fight happen.
Gypsie King 🤴
Hes getting ko sorry fury fan...Wilder will expose this cheater...
Absolute Quality upload  🔥🔥🔥🥊🥊
Fury: Joshua fought Klitschko after his prime.   Meanwhile  Fury: Klitschko was already a world champion while I was still young..   Outside of boxing I bet he's a great guy. Inside of boxing he's a delusional man who talks absolute shit.. Fought nobodies and claims he fought the best in their primes. Klitschko was on his way out when fury fought him. Prime Klitschko does Wilder, Fury and AJ.
G Nev is smashing it with this overlap series
Why are you calling him undisputed? That title is for when someone has all the belts. 3 out of 4 major belts are in possession of AJ!
didnt share alll though did he? dodges questions as well as he does punches
Pulev and Povetkin were mandatories. Fury continues to fight absolute nobodies.
Anxiety is a future based emotion, where the sufferer wants certainty to feel safe in a world that by its very nature is uncertain. As a therapist, I treat people daily for this condition. It's actually very easy to treat.
wow, wot a guy..
Been waiting for this interview, quality!
This made me wanna buy another pair of white sneakers and some loafers
"I fought the best men in their prime" which are those best men, only fought Wilder in his prime and he's a bum.
Anxiety is horrific :(
He's entertaining but he ain't half full of shit.
"Failure is a bruise not a tattoo" - great saying, will remember that for the rest of my days
When you said "I just want to be Happy" I broke down!.... I know now, you know :-(
He's just the boss ant he
You realise how big he is
He bottled the fight with AJ. His real could’ve terminated the 3rd Wilder fight and didn’t. He’d gain a lot more respect if he came out and said this.
Gary Neville is the greatest of all time
Tyson Fury is spot on  Anthony Joshua has amazing PR and Marketing team cus hes actually fought some awful ppl.  25 fights and just Klitschko was his hardest fight,  his whole career he's been fighting ppl at the right time how he lost to Ruiz was a joke. But no one can call him out cus your seen as "hating and negative"
Literally lost count of how many lies he’s told and I’m only 15 minutes in 🤦‍♂️
I am a huge fan of Tyson but ffs he doesn’t half contradict himself 😂😂. Gotta take literally everything he says with a pinch of salt
Let’s be honest Tyson is as mad as brush  most of us are. He might spoof but he is a genuine person, I’d rather go for a pint with Tyson anytime than AJ
Great interview
Loved the interview 🙌 and what an awesome gift
Best interview I've seen with Tyson. Really well done 👍
Great content
Fury turned pro 2008 Joshua turned pro 2013  NOTABLE OPPONENTS   Fury - Klitschko & Wilder  Joshua - Klitschko, Povetkin, Whyte, Parker, Pulev...
Bullshit you run from Dillion whyte dosser
Can’t stand the bloke. What a complete weapon
Next opportunity s fillip hergavic, dillian whyte, David Haye,aj
Gary Neville ripped into AJ without even knowing
🐐
I'm tired of the lies. I'm tired of the promises. AJ, Fury & wilder all robbed boxing fans of the fights we really want to see. Sort it out.
Ha took me 10 min to realise its Neville
Conor McGregor used to be the best character in the sports world but Tyson is number one today
Phenomenal story
in the first 30 seconds i heard "ive fought the best men in the world in their prime" at that point he lost me, how delusional can one man be, im starting to think he says things just to get attention because he has literally fought NOBODY in their prime...he then says 10 minutes in, "ive only got 2-3 fights left because there's no challengers"....well there would be if he fought the top 10 ranked guys but he keeps ducking them like he has done for years,  picks and chooses which fighters he thinks he has the best chance of beating and ignores the rest. this guy is actually a joke. he can box but he dont half talk shit. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Would love to see Mayweather and Fury fight
Love him or hate him but you got to admire and respect him 🙌🏾
Team AJ spent months putting in place the record high money, the date, the venue, the contracts etc. Team Fury didnt lift a finger and poured cold water on the fight in every interview during the time. Fury pulls then out. So which side didnt want the fight again Tyson? Its plainly obvious who didnt and Fury's explanation is laughable!
i really loved this i follow tyson on the platforms and he seemed arrogant but this was a true insight of him and now i hope after this he batters aj and i loved that pic being a man u fan as well brilliant
I rate aj more but this guy is so much more insightful and real when he’s talking, aj just puts it on
His comeback was beyond words and an incredible, almost unbelievable, achievement in sport. I think Fury has had better super nova moments and Joshua the better overall c.v. They need 2 fight 2 determine who is no. 1. Shame for fans Fury tied into the wilder 3rd fight. Fingers crossed they both come through. I really like Fury, inspirational and might go down as one of the all time best if he beats Josh (and vice versa I guess) ...but I do take what he says with a pinch of salt! That's boxing!
best tyson interview to date can listen to tyson all day special person for sure
Contradicting himself again… says money doesn’t matter but then goes on to talk about going against the arbitration could see him sued for$80 million… joker
Outstanding!
"I come from a business background" ahhh yes thought I recognised the kid sat in the back of the car when the gypsies conned me by selling me a fake camcorder
His confidence... It reminds me a bit of the great Muhammad ali. 💯
Awesome and insightful interview. Looking forward to Tyson v Wilder III
Never heard so much bull**** in my life lol. Fury is the one ducking clear as day
These Gary Neville chats are mad because people I didn't like before watching the interviews become very likeable
Joshua - Fake Fury - Real
Can someone tell me when this was done? Is this Fury now?
I was never a big fan of Tyson over the years, I didn’t dislike him, I just wasn’t interested, maybe because I’m not a big boxing fan.. But the last couple of years since I started actually listening to him, now I just love him more and more every time he talks.. Fantastic interview, he’s a Top, Top, down to earth guy.. Good luck to him and il be supporting him in anything he does. 🙌😉  Edit: Btw Gary, I’m a Liverpool fan so you can imagine my opinions of you years ago 😊 but you are a top bloke also mate. You’re killing the competition in this interview malarkey.. 👍
Interesting how he chose "Time Travel" but only wants to live for the present. Wish he would have expanded on that
Listening to Tyson speak always puts me in a good mood
Brilliant interview
10:21 they cut what he actually says that 'most people don't know' and try to clip it to a different thing altogether. Sneaky cover up.
Only Tyson can wear a tshirt, trackies and custom made gold slippers walking down a beach lol  Massive respect for him tho, really honest and open person.  Inspiration to a lot of people
What he had is whats called 'session depression' when you consume that amount of cocaine everyday you'll have bouts of massive depression & anxiety... Every1 has been fed a massive load of bs..
So funny Fury is the one that backed out of a signed contract with AJ he gave the opportunity to win multiple belts just to retain on 😂. This is the Fury that turned down the opportunity to fight AJ (he had nothing scheduled) and Andy Ruiz took it. This is the Fury that twice backed out of his rematches with Klitschko, sore ankle, and his uncle died 😢bless. And of course he was already stripped of a belt for not taking a mandatory. This is the Fury who wouldn't accept rematches with 2 cruiserweight that dropped him. He's a typical F Warren duck and dive fighter. Just Google Aj's opponents  and then Wikipedia Furys 😂that's not my opinion that's facts. He fought an ageing Klitschko at a time WK was having personal issues and Chisora who David Haye had previously destroyed twice, that's it the other rankings are very low. A poor count saved him in the wilder fight, the second Fury had a good fight. Let's see what happens in the 3rd. Personally if I was confident I would have thrown my single belt in the bin and fought AJ for multiple belts, that would have taken place by now. Now they have different fight schedules and mandatory so unless Fury dumps his one belt in the bin he won't fight AJ. I predicted this 18 months ago Fury won't meet AJ unless he loses in Wilder 3. Neither will he fight top contenders like Ruiz, Whyte etc.etc. He Cherry 🍒 picks 😂. Prove me wrong Fury,  I haven't been wrong yet.
What a fantastic watch
Listening to Fury you'd think he'd fought 5 or more top heavyweights in their prime 😂 He's literally only fought 2, Klitschko and Wilder. And you could argue that Klitschko was in better shape when he fought Joshua.  He's a decent fighter and it's a close call between him and Joshua when they fight but don't let him fool you he's not really fought anyone of note.
looks like he's holding a babycino
his t shirt is sick
He talks a lot of crap, hes a shit house. Aj or D white will smash him
Labunotch
how are there so many positive comments, he chats shit
Love Fury, honest as ever and classy fighter!
Your a good boxer mate but your not that good ,wilder might knock you out but AJ will spark you as you can’t punch hard enough .
who are the great heavyweights in their prime he has fought....his record of fighters is pathetic compared to who joshua has fought, this guy is the biggest gobshite ever to grace the sport of boxing
I so like Tyson after this interview, he is far more real than what I've heard of him yet. Between him AJ now am so confused whom to support. What a wonderful guy and such a brilliant interview.
Labunotchi
Great interview 🙏
Seems like Morcambe is a Wise place to live.
What an interview 👏 🙌
Same old rubbish from the chicken tyson fury bottled it against joshua,  fought end of his career Klitschko and one dimensional wilder,  getting tired of his excuses and victim excuses
Gary Neville is the new Ross Kemp
Cheers lads
Who would have thought that G nev would become One of the greatest pundits, greatest analyst and incredible interviewer! The guy was born to do it.
This man is a living legend 😎
It seems these days the only way you can get a council flat is being a immigrant with lots of kids and a fake disability.
My favourite boxer
Fury is hilariously honest and on it, love watching and listening to him, I don’t think I would every bet against him haha
Tyson fury a  great man, brilliant interview from neville 🥊 tyson so down to earth 👊🏻, the people's champ
furys team messed up the aj fight aj wanted the fight
What an inspirational human being. No ego at all just a down to earth realist. Such an intelligent man. By all the comments I'm seeing are just all positive for this unique individual!
Good local Lad Fury :-) Just what we need here in Morecambe.
Yet again a great interview although I do think Fury was the cause of the fight collapse I don’t think he wants a piece of Aj
How can you not like the Gypsy King 🙌🏽
Enjoyed every bit of this interview. I love Tyson Fury very much and won't get tired of listening to him. Very Intelligent and God fearing man. All the best in his next fight!
love tyson, respect to him..
Haha that painting was class
I respect his skills and the journey he has been on is amazing, but there is clearly distorted thinking going on, I hope this does not manifest into something more serious. Having the courage to call out a powerful narcissist is difficult and whilst Sky etc can make money out of him I suspect they will keep their heads down. I hope he and those around him stay safe and well.
There's Only ONE!!!! TYSON FURY!
Love Tyson but Jesus them shoes 🤦🏻‍♂️😅
I respect the whole mental health talk
I like tyson but lets be real AJ and his team done everything to make this fight they even went to negotiate with the saudis and Tysons team turned the fight down, whys he acting like AJ didn't want the fight.
Nothing fury does is anywhere close to  THE GREAT MUHAMMAD ALI Nothing
epic interview.
He supposedly knows about mental health..... But his the biggest troll of all time
Morcambe looks beautiful.
Tyson fury living the dream ,walking down the beach with his favourite 90s boy band action figure 😂😂
This man is the absolute man
Mans got Versace slip ons walking down the beach haha
This is class.
Can't take Gnev seriously wearing skinny washed out jeans and his tiny denim jacket , double denim is just a NO,NO !! . 😂😂😂
What happened to the driving towards the bridge suicide attempt 🤔... Fucker always changing the story that made him return to boxing  CONTRADICTION
Gary Neville is a right geez.
Fury talks so much shit it’s actually a joke, Especially the AJ talk…
I could listen to Tyson tell his story’s all day, I think we can all relate to him in some way with what he’s been through. By far the best interview Gary has done. Tyson go and smash wilder then go smash AJ. You’re the people’s champ 💪
The original Renaissance painting of the caricaturised version given by Neville to Fury at the end depicts the death of Christianity & the rebirth (Renaissance) of Paganism/Humanism. They come at you from all angles Tyson.
Fury should smoke the toad with mike tyson
31:20 sly sly tryna get a pic with Tyson fury in the background 🤣
The best episode of the overlap, without question. Fury is the person who relates the most to the common people. Only one Tyson Fury
Love this guy. If we ever moved back to Old Blighty would love to have a beer or two, or even a decent coffee n chew the fat with him, what an inspirational piece... long may the Gypsy King reign... peace
Joshua hasn't fought anyone in their prime ?  Fury has only faced 2 worldclass opponents, 1 a very limited puncher and the other a few months off 40.   This guy is a walking contradiction, wouldn't believe a word he says
Isnt quality youtube content a wonderful thing 👍
Gary literally taking over the podcast game..
really enjoyed this
tyson is a fraud
What a legion
GO 🥊💨TYSON FURY 🥊💨🇺🇸GO FURY GO !!!
Lyson Fury the ducker, dude never defended any belt but he's out here talking bubbles.😂😂😂😂 what a bum
Such a inspiring person! Long live Tyson Fury
Proper legend Tyson Fury, England's best ever boxing champion.
Quality gift, quality interview, love that
Well Tyson lets see when you lose and how you handle it. I have a feeling it will be insane excuses
We know he bottled the AJ fight. Nobody wants to see a third wilder fight. Yawning at the thought of it. Hopefully nobody really buys the PPV  and  hopefully he doesn't get caught by a awesome Wilder punch or its probably Wilder Fury 4 and 5. Fecking yawn
Finally someone that can properly describe a panic attack
As much as I love fury and everything he stands for, I struggle with his comments around money….. it’s really easy for a multi millionaire to say he don’t care for money, utter bullshit. He has repeatedly said I’ll fight this guy and that guy for a big bag of money. Come fight AJ in the uk for a million quid each and return the uk to the pinnacle of boxing instead of fighting in the USA.  Fury to beat AJ said it for years!!
Tyson is absolute class. !!
I had two anxiety attacks a few months back and Tyson is spot on in his description. You feel like you’re dying, having a heart attack but you’re not. Such a weird horrible experience that feels so unique, so it’s good to see Tyson talking about it openly. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone honestly.
Morecambe looks gorgeous, somehow reflecting Fury’s attitude’s towards life, and he deserves the gift at the end, which is perfect — Cantona was a king back in the day, and so’s Fury.👑
TYSON  And  KUGAN  HAVE THE BENT KNEES  SYNDROME
Took the piss with adverts on this 1 like
This man is an inspiration
Brilliant lads
Long live the King
12:28 brilliant shows how genuine tyson is true gentleman of the game hope he takes heads off d lot of dem
What‘s 28 stone?
Tyson Fury is Huge. Hes a damn Giant
Load of bull
Fury is so full of 💩 it's unbelievable he talks so much 💩 he even convinces himself he's telling the truth . Fact is he beat Wlad and caught him on an off night and didn't fancy the rematch so went on a 3 year bender !
This man is an inspiration.
Crolla is a good interviewer!!!!
Neville has found his forte. Brilliant stuff these interviews.
As someone who had been suicidal over the summer, hearing Tyson talk about his mental health really made me feel a lot more normal!
Few interviewers would pressure-question Fury in a Parkinson style whilst walking so close to the sea, nice try Gaz 🤣😂 someone get Porky down there, he'll get the truth in 5 mins!
Once Wilders done with, Joshua. Maybe Whyte after that but then really who else is there? Fury's a legend.
11 seconds in and it’s the first of many many contradictions. Fury announced the fight 2 days before the court case with wilder. Just saying🤷🏻‍♂️
Legend
Anyone else bored of hearing furys same story about mental health at first i praised it but now it’s like a sob story
The greatest hands down.
The amount of contradictions from fury in this interview is astounding.
This cameraman loves shoes and feet. Holy shit mate...
Gone full circle on tyson, when i was younger i didnt like him, thought he was full of bullshit etc, but as you grow older you realise who really does and its not tyson, proper bloke! The way he described the mental illness battle is spot on as well, couldnt of put it any other way myself!
As One and true leader goes..  in many talents which the earth is blessed with in Christ, for and beyond business, sharing that gift or talent is to the world: view point! presented, taken & recycled so..  STRart 2 Bring It On!  LDen.. KngGPSFury vs AJAKAFemi.. voor His name .. sake; quite a good dust up taste already thanks 🙏✌🏽👊🏼 Excellent work!
Not only is he the most charismatic fighter in his sport, he just so happens to be the best in his weight division. If he beats wilder and AJ he'd be remembered with the best of them. Cant help but like the guy. Went off the rails big time and clawed his way back to the top. No filter and seems to be genuinely honest when he talks.
I didn’t like this dude a few years or so back but for him an absolute tank of a man to come out and openly admit he couldn’t sleep with the light off just shows what type of bloke he is to openly admit all the troubles his had should help many many people out their.   Top bloke Tyson.     AJ Will still do you tho
Some the most contradictory bs spouted by Tyson. Makes for a great showman, lousy fella to appreciate
Listening to Fury talk is so exhausting
This is a great great man we have before us, enjoy Tyson while he’s still active. A brilliant Heavyweight, one of the best
I admire Tyson Fury a lot. Me and him have zero in common, but he's one of those boxers who is not aggressive, doesn't throw his weight around. He is totally comfortable in his own skin and with his immense talent. He reminds me a lot of Chris Eubank.
Talks some shite though
This is a bias interview Tyson bottle the Joshua fight no excuse. He need to sign the contract and fight simple as that stop talking too much Gispsy Queen
Very impressive, good luck Tyson!
Gary nevilles a good interviewer. He let's them answer and doesn't interrupt.
I have the answer to boxings problem. Every 3rd year you have a boxing world Cup involving the top 16 fighters in the division, the 14 top ranked fighters and 2 wildcards who made the most gains in the rankings in the proceeding 2 years After the championship is won you then have 2 years to qualify for the next championships. This will force everyone to fight more and fight better people in order to be in the mix for the next world championship. The higher ranked fighters you fight the more ranking points you get.
Love tyson, the true people's champion!
Totally genuine person , admits his failings rather than making excuses. Good luck Tyson.
This interview makes you change your mind about Tyson fury, he’s actually a honest humble guy.
At least he knows the power of deontay wilder 👊well said Tyson 👏👏👏👏👏
The guys a g
Tyson is entertaining, and a great character, while Joshua is a boring robot . 😂😂
Awesome ❤️🇬🇧
Class gift
Chats so much bull... talking like he's fought the best fighters, only fought Klitchko & Wilder the other 30 odd fighters nobody's 😂
Never seen someone contradict himself so much in 40 minutes
I have never heard so many excuses in my life.
Something about Gary's style makes people open up, relax and talk a lot he's very good
I like this show, Gary.
Tyson’s voice has recovered! Looking forward to listening to this interview - Gary killing it at the moment with this content 🔥
Just release it straight away next time, was not worth the wait
I have a feeling Wilder is gonna knock Tyson out in the rematch
Love Tyson he gives me inspiration I don’t care if I die every day but listening to him I give myself another few days
What the fuck is Gary Neville doing in a boxing interview?
Wait for Fury to beat AJ and see the matchroom casuals cry.
Conman!!! Talks shit!  Aj would wipe you out!! Whyte too!!
Hope he smashes wilder. Deserves to be champ over that guy for sure.
Going to look abit off a tool if he gets sparked out hope he does come on Joshua
Cool guy
Doesn't care about business...gives up UK boxing license to fight in the US. Does WWE to build American profile (which didn't work cos he still cant sell a ticket over there), been on all the talk shows, throws his biggest payday away when he could've cancelled the Wilder trilogy months before signing it, writes a book and promotes it everywhere. Okeh
Ask him how many times he’s defended aWorld title??? “0”
The peoples champ.
Gary Dodged having to Buy Tyson a Present 🎁 by just grabbing a Painting 🖼 he happened to have,off the Wall???? Bloody Tight, Those Northerns!!!! Lmao 👍👏😆😆😆😆
he would be a good stand up comedian after boxing.
🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆
I love tyson but let's be factual. It wasn't aj who fucked the fight up, it was furys side. Even John fury said so.
Gary you have found your niche mate.. loving your work
The best BBC Sports Personality of the year winner Britain has never had.
Amazing interview!!!!
I speak for myself only but I bloody love it when people have no filter and no ulterior motive when it comes to interviews. Well done Fury and wish him the best. He's the complete opposite to Mourinho for example.
Delusional
Great interview there well done
Neville is the new Parkinson. Great interview Gary 👏🏻
Fight AJ. Don’t be scared Tyson.
The Gypsy King 💪
Great personality to have inside boxing, but tbh its too much talk/interviews and instgram/twitter and not enough fighting
Fury left out that he is a great story teller. I think he can excel wherever he finds himself.  He literally single handedly reignited the spark of the heavyweight division he still keeps the fire burning.  He is the top dog of the division.
It's hard to dislike this fella, always good to see the ability to have a laugh at themselves...boxers always seem to take themselves way to serious.
The way Tyson considered Gary's question and responded with 'The art of time travel' cracked me up. BIG MAN!
well nobody wants to be sued 80 mil
finally the non JD boxer
🧢 Money is strongly correlated to quality of life and happiness
Tyson is extremely intelligent - one of the reasons why he is such a unique and effective boxer.
I can’t take him seriously, I’ve lost a lot of respect for him this last year. It’s clear to see it’s him who let Britain down with the biggest sporting event of the last 25 years… let’s hope there is some truth behind his words and he gets in that ring with AJ.. I don’t think he wins though, maybe the fury who fought wlad in 2015 would of beat the Joshua of today but I don’t think he would last! I think AJ stops you… but still a fan, good luck fury against wilder.
Move over Parkinson! Enjoying your interview style Gary...
Am sure wilder is watching right now All the best to the both of them
Tyson you fought Vlad at 39 who wasn't in his prime either and stank the place out. Beyonce Wilder isn't the "most feared knockout puncher in history" George Foreman perhaps even Julian Jackson was. Wilder has always been protected by the WBC and has always had a limited set of skills and you have made zero title defences.
Brilliant! Again Gary.
Tyson talks so much shit 🤣🤣
Great interview with a great caracter
This is absolutely the best interview I've seen in fighting. It wasnt just showbiz but Tyson being Tyson and being honest af. This helps people watching. Tyson is a lead Spartan. Fight on Brotha!
Always a good chat with Tyson 👏👏👍
Love Fury but he can’t chat on AJ’s resume at all🤣
Gary needs to get Hearn on next for sure
took your time
Why do you allow Tyson to swear but, you bleep out Gary when he does it?
How can you not love the gypsy king. Genuine as they come. The people's champ.
Love this channel hope to see more content like this in the future 👍
Will it beat keanos 3.2 mil?
Tyson don't half know how to chat shite
The people’s champ.
Funny guy but his to story is just full of inaccuracies from Vlad and pov and pulev ages to ali weight etc etc
I wonder if Gary wanted an excuse to get rid of that painting for years and this was the perfect time? 🤣
Fucking love this guy
Tyson is such a legend one of the most down to earth people out there.
Tyson says he’s not a business man but signs espn brings two books out fights on wwe ect he’s making real bank 💰💰
Quality 💯 takes a real man to understand and speak about mental health. Fair play lads great watch
Oh Lancashire is wonderful 🌹
AJ is the business man yet Fury has zero title defenses, zero mandatory defenses, no unification fights, and only two top 10 fighters on his resume. Fury is the fraud, AJ lives rent free in his head because of the love he gets from Brits.
All facts. AJ has never beat a prime, elite, unbeaten champion. He's a protected fighter. Fury beat an Undefeated in 11 years wlad in Germany and went to Wilders back yard twice and done the business. Levels.
19:50 - That bang must be like lighting definitely not straight forward fight for Fury despite what the fanboys say very possible he can be beaten if there's any minute slip in the fight and he gets hit.
smallest cup of coffee I've ever seen
Why is it so clean?
wilder is a very good salesmen and bulshitter :P  (cheating history aside). he should consider a career in politics after his boxing career
Gary walks like Alan Partridge.
Well,,,,, hand on heart.... I'm now a Fury fan ! Absolutely smashing guy..
Much prefer the brash trashtalking young hungry fury who didn't give a crap what people thought of him to this media friendly, wimp we have now
How can you not love Tyson Fury, total legend
What a top man, admits his faults and learns from there mistakes. Tyson Fury is the true NO.1!!!!!
Impossible not to like Tyson Fury..... A iconic sportsman who as continued to prove critics wrong. Its been a long and emotional journey to get where he is.....but hes conquered it
If you take a prime AJ vs a prime Fury, Fury probably wins. The problem is that Fury just isn't in his prime consistently, you really don't know what you'll get.   Add to this that AJ started boxing late in the day, he's effectively getting better over time.
24:10 I can take a lot of cocaine 😂🤣😂
A true champ. I salute you for not being ashamed of your Christian faith. Such an inspiration.
Excellent interview. Tyson is top class fella
Can this coward fight and stop talking? Fake white hope
The walking talking contradiction.
AJ fights OAPs AJ is the heavyweight nursing home champion of the world
He's so eloquent and honest, I love it. Then you see his shoes.
Not sure I agree that the best heavyweights generally don't fight each other at or near their prime. Ok Tyson v Lewis should have happened sooner but what other ones? I think both of them are avoiding it. Fury is concerned about AJ's power and punch skill set and AJ is concerned about Furys boxing and awkwardness. The true greats would relish the opportunity to show the world they are the greatest.
his come back is one of the best, i think what helped him was his genetics and his athletic lifestyle as a kid. ive seen people lose a lot of weight and they dont ping back into good shape and fitness like this
Tyson's my favourite boxer rn he is so good . What a man hope he wins from liverpool
Brilliant. Love Gary, love Tyson! Keep them coming lads 🙌🏽 *Cantona interview next 😂😂
👍😊
A man we all love
Absolutely brilliant, what a man.
Brilliant stuff. Thanks lads 👍🙂😁
Top this gary 👍
Love Tyson. He  is inspiring. Talented. Also great entertainment. These days I've also noticed he doesn't give a crap about the negative comments. Truth he said, most people including the boxing community around the world love him.
Fury is in such a good place, he cannot be defeated by anyone.
Is gonna be a good fight with Deonaty Wilder
I met Tyson before his comeback- when he was drinking etc- even when he was at a low point, he was a really nice guy and had time to talk instead of take a pic and fk off, really down to earth nice fella- i've got nothing but the highest of respect for him- and all the Fury familly!
Why does Tyson Fury say he’s 6‘9", yet in that opening clip, the height difference between him and 5’10"/5’11" Gary Neville is more like seven or eight inches — making him 6’7" tops.
I believe Tyson fury when he said Joshua and Eddie Hearn were just talkers because if fury can fight wilder in his prime and also knowing that AJ hasn’t fought anyone in his prime Aj just fights bums only himself and Eddie Hearn are to scared to fight fury because they both know it’s gonna end well If they fight fury so that’s why they try to make excuses and try to make fury look like the coward when it’s actually Eddie Hearn and Joshua who are running away from Fury 😭
Great interview. But to be honest hes only got same legacy as Buster Douglas. 3 world title fights. Compared to the greats who have all had 20 plus. Needs to defend an dont go missing
Tyson looks big and strong. Good deyontay.
This fool is a massive liar. Can't believe a word this fool
interviews with Fury or his dad are the best content put there, just amazing
Tyson Fury is a legend and speaks like a normal person
He's right. Joshua's record is full of people past their prime. Wilder atleast has Ortiz, Bermane when he was a champ. Areola who gave a much better fight to ruiz than Joshua did. Brazael guy who went 8 round with joshua and 1 minute with wilder and we can just keep going, where as Joshua literally has dillion white who just got whopped in 4,5 rounds by a guy much smaller than him, a retired Klitchko, retired pulev, and andy Ruiz who whooped his ass
Such a great man.
Fury is as genuine as they come
Great stuff
Tyson Fury is an absolute G! 💯❤️
Anybody know where we can buy Tyson’s T-shirt from?
Tyson showing such honesty and vulnerability is honestly incredible to see and hear. Even the strongest around need help sometimes. Brilliant interview
Do you know hou much the suing case was $80 million dollars.........?????? For wilder. Wow at 60/ 40 Tyson is getting $120 milliion with bob sayimg the june postponed fight which he said had sold  $18million dollars in gate at venue. I guess most of those people are busy in october as loads of tickets unsold and guess they must have returned them as they were valid for october. Amazing how pbc and fox guaranteed over 4 million ppv buys in the contract as they give networks half of the 80 dollar ppv fee. No lawyer would sign a contract for his fighter to be liable for 80 million dollars if he never stepped back in the ring.  fury wilder 1 and 2 did not do $80 million after networks took their share even if you believe gate of $16 million for fight 2 and 800,000 ppv buys at roughly 40 dollars after networks taken their share. So $48 million dollars was gross revenue being generous as  300,000 of those were not full price ppv's. At 50/50 each fighter got $24 million max before paying promotors bob and frank and mtk and trainers,camp costs, travel and all your team, lawyers and insurances etc. Oh wait Tyson was exagerating ......
He talks the same old shit Wilder will hit him so hard you think he's head is the moon
Funny how the people who have the money say " I dont care about the money "
Tyson is the new peoples champion, walks around with no security and always has time for his fans. i will admit when he first come on the scene he wasn't for me but he won me over just like he has to millions of other people. i hope he fights AJ as it will honestly be a demolition job.
Amazing interview and Tyson Fury is a wonderful character!   That painting Eric Cantona had made though is one of the funniest things I have ever seen in my life.
Great Interview and how refreshing to listen to a elite sportsman talking so honestly without media training and agenda - what a great guy Tyson is. Awesome!!!
Tyson Fury is a legend
Can't tell you how much I enjoyed that, Tyson is a true inspiration
Tyson is full of it. In the 60s and 70s the best always fought the best. Frazier, Ali, Foreman. All fought eachother multiple times and they were the absolute best.
Tyson Fury's description of depression, after beating Kichko, sounds just like suffering addiction. No wonder he went down hill. But, what a come back story, and I hope our big champ beats Wilder (again).
Blah blah blah heard it all before no mention of the roids 🐗half truths half lies walking contradiction 🎪🤡controversial Trilogy followed by a Quad n a gobby retirement🤤
I don't know why people feel the need to chat shit. 80 million cost for not fighting 30 million reward for fighting is what he said
At home with the fury's, numerous wwe appearances, book signings, song with robbie williams  But he is not looking for fame 🤔
Let’s not take the piss here, all the AJ stuff is straight cap. They wormed it but will never admit it
So many ppl slating fury but he doesn’t make these contracts. And why would he pay wilder 80m when he’s beat him twice with 17/19 of the combined rounds going to fury when he can make another 40m and just fight Joshua in half a year
Picking on Gery Neville, come and pick on one of us.. said nobody ever.
Some of you armchair fans try to hard in the comments there's only 1 undefeated Heavyweight champion
And again Gary smashing it, great interview 👍
Tyson Dope Fiend Fury is Garbage.
Could it be that Fury and his team didn't want the AJ fight at the time? And used his name to help promote the third fight with Wilder? As if that's the case then it has worked!
What a guy and what a human tells it like it is his comeback is the one of the greatest comeback in sport a great spokesman for mental health and despite everything he has been through always stayed true to Himself and I have no doubt he will bear Wilder and then Joshua 👏🏻🥊
fury sounds like a sound guy
I want a klopp type hug from Tyson ...
Where is Neville's jacket from?
Tyson Fury’s my favorite boxer right now, has been since he beat Klitschko. Just inspiring, charismatic, lot of heart and skill. Legend. Btw, those dislikes are from the Zinc Bomber’s fans 😂
Gary wearing his tallest shoes for this one
Fury was riding with the right hand in the second fight tho.
We need a roy Keane tyson fury podcast
Could literally listen to him all day, inspiration to many!
Those shoes damn 😍
Tyson can talk the talk and he can back it up, I’d just like to see him back it up a little more often
Great  Interview  as usual.  I have  battled anxiety  and some depression  for years while  I never  drank or did drugs my issue  has been  spending  money  on sports, books  and music  stuff. To hear  a star  athlete  talk about  his shortcomings  helps  a lot.
If Joshua beats usyk fury is not fighting wilder read between the lines
THERES ONLY OOOOONNEE TYYYYYYSON FURY
Wow thats mad to think Gary played for what 12 years and always wished he could just enjoy his JOB fully without the pressure. When your job becomes a  burden and your not enjoying what you do but keep going cus of money family etc is very relatable
top guy tyson youl never be beaten and you looky looky good m8 from sunny scotland
They're the shoes I'd pick for a walk on the beach too.
Gary is a great interviewer the one previously with Roy Keane was top notch.
What an absolute brilliant interview!! Congratulations to Gary! But how inspirational is Tyson?? Love it.
What a guy. What a pleasure to hear him speak about personal issues and how he coped etc. What a legend.
40 minutes felt 4 minutes. Wonderful interview
1 hour. 39,000 views for a 40 minute interview. That is mental
Morecambe is Great. The town itself like other seaside town, a bit of a dive, but the front, coast and surrounding villages and nature is quiet and beautiful. I love it here. Hills behind. Manny and Liverpool just down the road, lakes up the road. It's not end of earth by no means. West Cumbria is!! The motorway and main west train is on the doorstep. Tyson chose a great location.
What your descriptions of where boxing should go Gary !!! Is the ufc model .....and it genuinely works !!! Best fight the best all under 1 banner 1 title for 1 weight class !!! I love boxing truly do but it’s got to change cause the political and broadcast issues ruin boxing !!
Love this man so genuine such a normal guy legend knock Joshua out king
AJ doesn't fight anyone in their prime? Dillian Whyte, Joesph parker, Uysk, Andy Ruiz, both beat wald when he wasn't in his prime. so he admits the contract expired! gotta love this conman.
Interview Lewis Hamilton next please.
Tyson makes Garry look like a dwarf
What neville and fury got in common = both never defended the heavyweight belt
Watch fury pull out of the trilogy soon 🤷‍♂️😂
I swear Fury is a walking contradiction 🤣🤣🤣
Another class interview. The Overlap is top notch.
I think fury is lying again. You can't place a contract on an individual to fight no matter what even if he gives up his belt. That's tantamount to enslavement.
Only have 2-3 fights couple days ago said he has a 5 fight plan 😂😂
Superb interview !,,best heavyweight in the last 50 yrs Fury!,heart of a lion the lad🙏🏻top bloke aswel
Tyson fury they are doing it for money, look at his shoes 👞 🤣😂🤣
Great interview, neville smashed it
Love watching these 😂❤️
great interview. feel bad for Tysons wife though, hope she isnt guilt tripped as he said without her he'd be dead. not something id wanna hear personally.
There is only one only one say it guys
Gary Neville what a fantastic interviewer. Tyson just says it like it is top man. Listening to him a while back made me get help for mental health issues and I have him to thank that it wasn’t seen as a weakness or odd, as he says you’ve got to have been there to know how random it feels to have everything in your life but not want to continue. Mans an inspiration and a breath of fresh air 💪👍🙏
like del boy - in only fools.   he secretly loves the chase for a deal - sale - money but when he gets it   it then becomes "now what"
Does Fury think that it's Roy Keane interviewing him @17:09
It's good to hear Tyson talk about anxiety at 29:30, he is absolutely spot on. There is no real way to explain why anxiety happens, although there are many causes. When an attack comes on, it's one of the worst feelings in the world. Good to take comfort that even a 7' giant still gets it. Keeping your mind active whether that is through exercise, art, walking, education etcetera, is key to overcoming it.
Couldn't thank Tyson enough for his upfront and honest approach to talking about mental health. Like many I have been there and I recognise the emotions, fear and battle he discusses. He's now advocating for people to talk about their mental health and I'm so grateful for him for it. At 30 years old I've grown up following Tyson. I've and watched all of his fights, interviews and training videos but watching him use his platform to talk about the - often - invisible struggles of depression has been, for me, his crowning glory. Thank you, Tyson
The man is an inspiration.  And he's the people's champion.
He's come a long was since this ... https://youtu.be/wdFP-R_LYSM
Love him or loathe him, Fury is box office. Fascinating character.
How’s Gazza worn fresh whites on that beach
if joshua v tyson doesn't happen it will be the worst thing ever to happen to British boxing, if it does it will be the best thing but i fear time is getting on and wont be in their primes
So much excuses he clearly doesnt want the fight. He is going in circles about governing bodies the wbo and wbc and wba and ibf all were in support of the fight happening
Props to the camera team for this. Next level cinematography. 👍
He needs to sort his shit out these big fights will soon be gone and he will be wasted potential.
First time I felt Fury is Bullshiting.
Tyson - the greatest ever - the people' champ !!!
Check the facts being dropped... of course Fury got stitched up in America by Al Haymons lawyers.. Haters will deny it.
I wish I’d stay out of trouble
LIEson Fury!!
DOSSER !
Could listen to the Gypsy King talk about toilet paper. Love Tyson as an athlete and his story is tremendously compelling. The man deserves his success.
This guy chats so much shit. He doesnt want to be a  celebrity but he has a reality tv show about his family and 2 books and a christmas song with robbie williams. He talks about money but he doesnt kno what its like to live without it.
good man
Who Has Fury fought in their prime?
This interview is absolutely top drawer 👌 Tyson fury has been through hell and back and to see where he is at now is outstanding 👏 hats off to Gary aswell top interview with 2 top blokes
Hypocrite
What’s with the obsession of Tyson’s shoes 😭
I admire Tyson Fury so much to comeback from something like depression and to beat it is an inspiration to all the people suffering from this .
Been waiting for this. Gary is so confident asking direct but not controversial topics that may upset the interview. Keep going Gary love it
As a city fan I've got to give it to old Neville , genuinely great interview again ! ,He's going to end up with his own show
Obviously we love Tyson but he’s lying about the AJ situation, it’s ridiculous
God bless Tyson fury 👍🙏💙
I love fury godbless him mental struggle is one helluva ride not many finish the ride Sane or alive
NICE ONE TYSON FURY
What a talker! Lost all respect when he didn't want to fight a motivated, trained, angry Klitschko. Just waited long enough for him to retire before he crawled out of his hole. Don't get me wrong, he's a great boxer but not nearly the man he thinks he is. Just start boxing the best and don't wait two years to do so.
Great watch love Tyson, authentic person knows hes done wrong and doesnt make excuses, just tries to do better. Something we can all learn from. Great interview gary
He only fought bums, this man hasn’t defended any titles only went on a bender
Never been a fan of Fury because of the "persona" I can tell after 5 mins of this he is going to grow on me massively.
He’s looking HUGE in shape huge he’s definitely sticking to his word & upping his weight
They need a belt to give the person who tells  Tyson Fury "enough is enough" ...after 6 pints 😂🤣😂🤣😂✌️
Carnt believe the heavyweight champ lives round the corner I pass his house on way to work and always look up to see if he's there hands aloft champ I'm sad but love this man
The king. The man was born a king. He is unstoppable. Aj don’t make me laugh. Aj is a bodybuilder. Lol
I've suffered from anxiety and bouts of depression since my earliest memories. Tyson coming out and sharing his story with the world helped push me to seek help and honestly having a counselor once a week to have a chat can do wonders.
He uses the mental health as his weapon he took the piss outta Deontay for not mentally wanting to talk in his promo for the third fight you can't have it both ways Tyson is nothing but a puppet to yes people
Straight talker .. Much respect
Would have so much more respect for him if he said it’s my teams/promoter fault on our side, he just acts like he dosent want the Joshua fight..
Contradiction runs in this guys veins, won't change
One day someone is gonna make a movie on Tyson's life and I can't wait for it!
Islam is the truth. Read the Qur'an
So many contradictions
Stop waffling and fight AJ!
Ooo wilmslow  so posh
Fantastic interview. Tyson is a superstar just for talking candidly about his mental health. Good to hear him talk about Wilder’s power, instead of joking about him like he normally does when talking about his rivals.  I just really hope he beats Wilder and AJ beats Usyk, so they can pick up where they were up to with making the undisputed fight.
Tyson is tremendous character. But you cant trust his words anymore. He is the businessman here, AJ clearly wanted to fight.
I do think Tyson takes the fight in 6. But he needs to say it outright. The fight was made possible because solely because of AJs team from negotiating the deal, to getting the venue to sorting out a date and everything. It wasn't Tyson's fault but it definitely was Bob arums for being an idiot and making false promises/guarantee
Regardless if you dislike him or love him, he sure as hell been through pissed shit liked some Hollywood movie..
"I fought the best men in the world at their prime".....never fought Vitali, never fought Povetkin, never fought Pulev. Those were the best heavyweights on the planet. In more recent times, he has never fought a single title holder other than Wilder. But yes, lion lol
Still not sold any tickets? He only wants to fight builders. Its obvious what he is. Keep running.
Tyson's shoes 😂😂
Fury doesn't care about money but signed one of the biggest contract with ESPN? This clown is a walking contradiction. You have to be beyond stupid if you are slurping what this fraud sells
So sef sefari and otto wallin and Tom shwartz were all top heavyweight tyson ye... 🤣🤣We know who the plumb is!
Best interview really good please Gary interview Walder next
That's not all he's sharing, he shares the same amount of heavyweight title defences with Eddie hearn 🏃🏃🏃🏃🕳️😂😂😂😂😂
Good god he talks shit he couldn't give up the belt to fight well thats a lie is own dad said he told him to give up the belt and fight AJ he's fought the best in there prime again nope you haven't klitchko was only a year older when AJ fought him doesn't care about the entertainment or money yet went on WWE for entertainment and money and also refused to fight because there wasn't enough money in it so more bullshit Hes saying AJ knew he was in arbitration but hes the one that announced the fight first so more lies and then keeps banging on about this suicide ATTEMPT but then gos on saying he would kill AJ calm down m8 you can't even kill yourself and thats probably the easiest thing todo i can thing of 3-4 ways to kill myself in minutes so stop trying to get sympathy by saying you attempted suicide because if you actually did you would be dead just am attention seeking full of shit lier who constantly contradics himself and never defended a belt
Bomb squad wilder is coming for you fury you cheater
Gary Neville is turning into one of the best interviewers / TV personality in the UK. Come so far from his Sky Sport debut.
problem with boxing is that some  people are obsessed with unbeaten records - in any other sport its accepted but with this stupid obsession it stops fighters fighting who the fans  want
Where's @The YB
AJs priority is not Business, that’s why he ACTUALLY DEFENDS HIS BELTS AND FIGHTS HIS MANDATORIES, this doesn’t sound like someone who puts business 1st but legacy 1st. People think AJ cares about business the most because of all his sponsorships, it’s not his fault that these companies what his face on their products🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Fury has a lot of inner demons plus he's a liar. He's the most naturally gifted but I got Wilder this time. When Fury is not training he's drugging and boozing.
Okay Gary a real Manchester United phenom.
Can't believe I'm older than Tyson
The king 👑
The Overlap is the best show on any platform right now.
What a bullshiter. AJ should have known about the arbitration? They were given assurances it was a done deal and it was YOUR case! FFS.
Eh Vlad was 39yrs old when Fury got a boring points decision over him, hardly in his prime was he? Same age Povetkin was when he fought AJ, 🤦🏻‍♂️
amazing interesting and unique character.   Raw, unfiltered and brute strength which is a mirror image of the curated, marketed body builder that is AJ. Tyson fights with heart, AJ fights like a robot.
Tyson is genuine  🙌
I like the T-shirt Tyson u and what the enemy for the nxt few years should look like. Hopefully we get to see u fight them all like u said u would but I doubt u will fight any of them except from Wilder. Kinda hope he catches u this time and you stay down 🥊🥊🖕🏽🖕🏽
Anybody else notice Gary's is happy in one way or another
Forty minutes of Tyson Fury playing the mental health card..here goes.
I always thought Tyson Fury was a loudmouth, disrespectful person but boy after watching this I have a lot of respect for the man, after all he's been through he deserves to be world champion. Good luck Tyson.
Before it starts bet mental health crap and Joshua fault
That’s a regular coffee he’s holding like an espresso ☕️
My name is giovanni giorgio but everybody calls me giorgio
Fury’s shoes are class. 🤣🤣
Tyson, wear that suit that Wilder wore last time to wind him up lol
Excellent interview again from Gary and so refreshing having major sportsmen like Tyson opening up so clearly, very interesting.  What a gift at the end as well, fair play!!!
Having dealt with depression or should say dealing with …what better inspiration can you ask for than Tyson fury ,the man the myth the legend  ,amazing human being father brother and son ,love the man ❤️💪👌👊
Great 40 minute interview full of lies.
Yet another superb interview 👏🏽
What a top bloke. Gaz is alright too.
30:40 that’s right, sometimes you can be depressed all your life and don’t know it until one day, something big happens and you wake up.
Lyson Fairy the walking contraction
Tyson  is the best 👌  king tyson no body will beat him god bless him and his family
That cantona painting is sick
Wilder will come to the ring wearing only a thong this time lol
I was raised on boxing, but honestly over the past few years it’s embarrassing no one wants to fight, kind of over it all. They are all liars because AJ, Fury & Wilder have all told lies at some point about fighting each other they are conning the public and fans.
I like Fury but he's chatting poo here, he had no idea of the arbitration coming? Joshua's side was doing everything and Fury's side was doing everything to make it difficult and then backed out
The furys are a different breed of humans 👑
Gary has never reassuringly nodded more in his life, the man knows he's in the company of greatness haha
Gary Neville looks like Franck Ribery on this video haha
Fury has grown on me a lot. Developed as a human being and hopefully we get to seen him box AJ.
Look how small the coffee cup looks
Can't help but love Tyson - keep going lad.
the respect and admiration i have for this man is unreal, what a story.
People think aj is humble Tyson is truly the humble one
an interview like this makes me like fury al ot...but then day later he can do another interview chatting absolute s%*@ that makes me despise him again
Why did this take so long to upload
Tyson is miles clear of everyone in heavyweight scene they all have a punching chance but on skill he’s the best .
Absolutely love this series
Fury: Oh yeh I’m scared of this plum.  Gary: Face time him now..  Fury: Nah.. he doesn’t answer anymore.. Gary: Go onnn?!  Fury: Nahh.
my favorite 40 odd minutes of youtube ever, thanks
What a gift.
Fury speaks sense when he talks about anything other then Anthony Joshua. Genuinely a humble, commited man but I just dont think he speaks sense when talking about other fighters. One moment hes saying he respects every fighting man who takes a risk, the next hes slagging off AJ for getting chinned
The people's champ
Wow I found that really generous of Gary to give Tyson the Cantona painting considering how rare they are and what it must've meant to Gary (even if he was depicted as a pauper lol). You just know that it reflects how much he thinks of Tyson to be giving him that. I would do too. We all know what Tyson's done inside the ring, but it doesn't compare to the good he has done outside of it for people struggling with mental health. I can barely count on one hand the number of people I feel a genuine "love" for, that I've never met. But Tyson is one of them. A kind, genuine and gentle giant (outside the ring at least) :)
Why are so many people struggling with the concept of people being different sizes? 😅
Really tough I don’t know who to believe Fury or AJ.  Why they haven’t fought yet idk but someone has to be at fault
He’s a character. I just don’t believe what he says.
I understand we want to see Fury vs AJ but in fairness to Wilder he did have an agreement for the rematch, he's been around knocking people out for a long time and earned the status for that rematch clause therefore no matter what you think of him, he deserves his last shot at Fury even if he is the underdog.
I'll never forget that fight against otto wallin it was the most corrupt fight I have seen for years
Amazing at can watch this for free. Great interview
Characters make sport interesting
Fury says AJ is a businessmen but Fury stated in an interview “USYK FIGHT DOESNT MAKE ENOUGH MONEY SO I WANT FIGHT HIM”  whereas AJ also took 40% less money to fight Pulev during lockdown. Sounds like fury is the businessman
You have to love the bloke for his true honesty. I would love to go for a cuppa with this man just to talk about his life, he is so likeable and you would never run out of things to chat shit about.
Tysson Shithouse Fury!
Tyson... My wife is never happy.. Advise please??
Sports personality of the 21st century.
Any have the clip of Wilder talking about seeing Fury at the boxing event pls
It's rare you come across real men like Tyson.
Great watch this
Got to give AJ credit for fighting Usyk
What a bloke
Tyson Truly is a Legend
I like Fury, but stop talking shit saying Joshua didn’t want it. It was very clear he wanted it. Why lie? Pointless. I’m not even a Joshua fan either.
Fury beat Klitschko when Wlad was 39 years and 248 days old. Apparently in his prime. Joshua beat Klitschko when Wlad was 41 years and 35 days old. Apparently waaay past his prime. Fury has fought Klitschko, Wilder and..... Chisora at a push. And who else?
Garry Reminded me of that 1 kid in school, stirring a fight with the 2 hard kids for a fight after school.
Love the overlap, is it just me or is Garry Neville genuinely the only  public person speaking out language... I'm gonna stay it Garry for Boris's job
Shoutout to tha mighty #LDBC #NewMedia
As someone who is suffering from depression, I can relate so much to Tyson. His comeback is truly magical and it gives me faith that I can get out of the dark place too. You are an inspiration and hero to me and many others. Thank you Gypsy King👏 ❤
Legend 👍👍
The shoes of a man who knows he can handle himself!  Tyson Fury, as real as real can be. Great guy.
Pleaseee get Cristiano ronaldo on this would be class 👌👌👀
To bad this was so short. Tyson is one of these guys you can listen to for hours. The true champ.
More contradictions than a vegan hunter.
Brutal honesty not bull pr teams spinning things make his opponents look a tosser. He manages do that with his hands
Amazing interview 👍🏼
As good as an interview as this is, all I can think about is how nice Morcambe looks!
Let's be honest, Tyson will do another interview next week, contradicting everything he said on this one.
I believe every letter of Tyson Fury words x
Amazing interview been waiting for this alot more humble than Joshua,  Speaks his own mind not what he thinks he should say,  Real recognise real😍
In 20 years we will realise how lucky we are to witness fury’s career, will never be another fighter like him
King of boxing But most importantly a massive inspiration in my life Peace to the Fury family
8:45 Tyson fury is right here, most billionaires and millionaires are unhappy due to the pressure of life and always striving for the perfect moment. Enough is never enough.
About fucking time!!
Gary pin this comment
Tyson is pure entertainment. AJ Is a boring robot
Finally lol
The greatest boxer of all time who has not defended a title does that make sense to you?
Great watch Gypsy 👑 all the way
Joshua lost to pizza man Andy Ruiz and he thinks he has a chance against the undefeated chypsy king Tyson Fury lol.
Why did Fury agree to fight Wilder 3 times? No one really has asked that question. When Fury agreed to fight Wilder for the 1st time, there was a rematch claus in that contract which meant that they fight twice. Why did Fury agree to fight Wilder for a 3rd time? Its because of that why the Fury vs AJ fight fell through.
Just fight AJ and and retire, mr I don’t want to be famous fury   Full of shit , a great fighter no doubt but an absolute fraud when it comes to money and fame
the most likeable character I've ever seen.....absolutely love him!!!!
Ffs! Why have they always gotta show a “coming up” reel when we just want to watch the full thing start to finish, playing the same clip 3x wow overkill 💀💀💀🙄🙄🙄🙄
Tyson fury is an absolute gentleman and gives a lot of money away to poor people.
I like him, but the amount of lying he does!
Imagine turning 90 minutes of an afternoon into a months worth of content
King Eric
0:30 Tyson Fury was out for 3 years and during that time Anthony Joshua fought Joseph Parker Brezeale Molina Parker and Wladimir, Fury gave Joshua 3 years to become undisputed and he didn’t achieve that unfortunately.
Class interview love Tyson
This overlap series is acc class 👏 👏
Tyson destroys AJ and has him doing his shaky leg dance he’s done against Whyte (lol), Klitschko and Ruiz.
So this video dropped 20 mins ago and it is 40 mins long and has been watched 5.3k times.   How is that possible?
Anyone else listen to Fury and think to themselves 'This guy is so full of shit' lol
Don’t let this distract u from the face young boys won 2-1 vs man united
“I’ve got billionaire mates and they are very unhappy”
Should be a pleasure to watch, always great interviews with Tyson
That's the number 1 undefeated heavyweight champion of the world. Gypsy king rules the division 😎🥊
People complain about Tyson's contradictions but it's an art, it makes his opponents uneasy because they never know if he's being genuine or what he might say next
Whether you like him or dislike him, you can’t deny he’s a character. We need more characters in sport. Is it just me or has sport, whether it’s football, cricket, boxing etc got boring?? I think it has. I actually think this bloke is the best heavyweight boxer at the moment. That’s my opinion anyway.
The greatest comeback story ever? 💪
AJ better resume. AJ would smoke Fury. Every interview Fury says something different. As a Brit we normally back our own but I hope Wilder humbles him. AJ is the king of the division and we all know Wilder and Fury have now both ducked AJ. Fury is nothing more than a dosser.  Listen to what he says. He always contradicts himself. We all know the truth. In most cases when he’s slagging he’s actually describing himself.  Fury actually announced the AJ fight 😂
God he talks some crap.
I dont even like boxing but you have to admire the mans simplistic candid nature. Always an enjoyable interview.
Love tyson brilliant role model
FURY > WILDER >JOSHUA
The contradictions…
Thought Sky sports where AJ fanboys
Doubt the fight will happen with them both in prime. Will be more like a Mayweather v Pacquiao
Boxing right now is in a dire situation. To rescue it - it needs The Best to fight The Best.
Fury may be a pathological liar but he's a charismatic and funny pathological liar lol. That's enough for me to be curious enough to tune in to his interviews. But come fight night, I'll be rooting for Watford's own. But hope its entertaining and good for UK combat sports in general.
You can tell Neville liked Fury more than AJ
Tyson>AJ all day in and out the ring !!
Fight Joshua and stop talking about it
Luke Fury the fibber
As much as I love AJ as a person there's something about Fury that just endears him more. He's no doubt a lot more genuine even if he does know he's a bit of an arse whereas AJ seems to be trained in his behaviour.
Neville you legend!
He wasn't optimistic about the AJ fight because he was never going to accept it.
Gary looks like a little kid walking around with his dad he’s so small compared to Tyson😂😂
We know Fury will school AJ
Took a while. Thought he'd cancelled...
Finally , I'm here to listen to those lies that excite lie-son feary fans 🤣
Oi Oi Gypsy Boy 👊👊👊
Good interview 👏
