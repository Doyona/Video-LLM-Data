1:25 conan violently screaming for help😂😂😂😂😂
IT'S BRUNCH
not the guitar being indistructable
The way he says “it’s brunch” at the start is so adorable ❤
that ''okay DAMN'' had me dead.
Conan Gray
Can anyone talk about harmony and how he skillfully shifts his vocal tone from one level to another?
Ashley
is it just me or i came here after reading nothing like the movies??
I need the superache shirt why haven’t I bought it yet 🥀
Not the dad side eying him
It's halloween rn
TODAY IS HALLOWEEN AND IM HEREEE
Anyone here in halloween 2025?🎃🖤
‘IT’S HALLOWEEN’ (it really is)
Telling your crush you like them can be a disaster😢
Anyone here in 2026????😊🔥🎶❤

overthinker final boss😂

He’s SOOO REAL FOR THISSSSS
i miss longed haired cone but wishbine cone 😍😍😍
Sooo underrated
I always liked this song but this is the first time I really stared at the music video... why did he fumble the witchy girl? I didn't see any red flags there! I guess she could've believed astrology was really real, that'd be a nope
Covered this on my channel 🫣 - https://youtu.be/TRCxo7dDSII?si=CaoaiaAUDCwaD1XT
What is this song
you mean 2025😅 i am 9
amo dmais
Here is 202- I don't know how he does it but this is literally me every single word
New favourite music video unlocked

WAIT THATS THE WISHBONE RECEIPTS!!!😭🙏
why am I only now realizing the "it's nine a.m" was a reference to taylor swift😭
Can it be called brunch if it’s 9am?
am I going crazy, or does that bill 0:21 look almost the same as the bill with the lyrics to Vodka Cranberry???
The video makes a good song even better
is anyone here in 2025 ?

set the scene I just left the party at Blake's and it's Halloween Had the keys to my car in my hand, but I didn't leave 'Cause the potential of us, it was keepin' me up all night long I left a text you won't read all night long This could be a disaster, there's so many factors Like, what if you freak out and then we're losin' it all At the critical chapter where I say, "I love you" And you don't say it after This could be a disaster, I'm pedaling backwards By saying that I'm drunk, I really shouldn't have called I'm a little bit plastered, you call me a liar Now I'm fallin' in faster This could be a disaster disaster (Oh) disaster lose my mind Is it purely platonic to call me, like, every night? You know Ashley believes that there's somethin' between you and I But if I'm readin' it wrong, man, it'd be better off if I died, oh And if you're readin' the text all night long This could be a disaster, there's so many factors Like, what if you freak out and then we're losin' it all At the critical chapter where I say, "I love you" And you don't say it after This could be a disaster, I'm pedaling backwards By saying that I'm drunk, I really shouldn't have called I'm a little bit plastered, you call me a liar Now I'm fallin' in faster This could be a disaster disaster (Oh) disaster Maybe I'm mistaken (oh) You're not mine for takin' (oh) Maybe I'm mistaken Maybe I just made it up, messed it up
This reminds me of taste from Sabrina carpenter😭😭😭😭
This smilling at loosing my mind is so good😂

Mapache que porquería -1

3:09 Is this fkn play about US 😭😭😭
i love this song so much
Does bro like girls or guys like I’m so confused
the blank stare and blinks as it starts is so real
I put the bar so low, it's technically in hell, yet everybody's limbo dancing with the devil.
Conan wearing the supeache is for virgins tank is so iconic
one of the best outros i've heard
I love this song but just imagine the waiter sitting there for 2 minutes like “um why are you starring at me🤨”
WHAT DID THE GUITAR DO TO YEW
This going to be me on valentine day 😢
I love the videos where he j starts breaking stuff. its like what i wish i could do through conan. like in the crush culture music video😙
I'm no "brunch" expert but at 9am... Wouldn't that still be breakfast? I think brunch, to me, would begin at 10am and last no longer than until 11:35am. I'd say you could get away with having brunch begin at 9am if it lasted 61 minutes but the check arrives at approximately 9am in this very real scenario... Although! if at this particular cafe, you ordered something that is typically a lunch-time offering (a ham sandwich, a caesar salad, etc.), I would be comfortable with saying it's "brunch." A lunch meal in breakfast hours. But, to me, brunch is breakfast foods at a time where the lunch-time hour is nearly upon you. Waffles at 10:40am. Brunch.  I need more clarity in your next endeavor at "brunch" portrayal, good sir.  (Jokes aside, love what you do, Conan! "Watch out for Mr. Gray," indeed!)
2025?GG❤🔥
Damn he was fine the guy in the vid
MAG❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
THATS A WAITER. SILLY ICECREAM CONE
He hate that guitar so much ahah
anyone in 2025?
What the guitar do 😭😭😭
Im sorry did that shirt say “superache is for virgins” 💀 😭
1:39 that between you and I has me on a chokehold
1:30 his face as he says “Let me just lose my mind” is so fucking iconic😂
IS NO ONE NOTICE? HE WROTE “الله" (allah is a god in islam) BRO??? 2:35
9am is breakfast Conan… Brunch starts later 😂
Poor guitar 😢
Ypu have to learn to understand urself before trying to seek and understand someone else. where do you stand with yourself, what do you enjoy most about life, do ypu know what helps you find peace? (Meditating, hiking ect.) you know just the biggest thing is that it starts with you
I love the vibes 🤓🤓🤓
IT WAS GOING SO GOOD😭😭😭😭😭😭
Im scared for the guitar
My favourite song by Conan
Anyone in 2024?🎉
the waiter looks like my dad, my dad is 62 though
I just love how dramatic he is😂❤
It's not really a disaster if you tried and put yourself on the front line, nothing is wasted ♡♡
You are a total messy disaster.😂
i don’t really get it :P
This is why I love Conan so much

Conan gray smacking a guitar is the best thing I ever seen. Tied with dying in the old fart’s car. Not an appropriate reaction, but I laughed. Also this should have been a single. U can’t change my mind
Conan : oh my relationships are horrible I go on dates and I literally hate everyon- *sees dude* also Conan:ohhhhhhhhhhh yea scratch literally everything I said
الله؟ 2:35 why

Gross! Enough said.
Yo te quiero mucho mucho mucho mucho❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
Ok but why was there a jojo siwa gulity pleasure thing in the corner of the video to promote it
Firstly, he is so adorable with his expressions 😂 Secondly, I am in the same boat. I have been single since 2015 😳. A couple of years ago, this turd was very persistent with trying to make me his girlfriend. After about 6 months or so I noticed I was starting to catch feelings, because I started to miss him when he wasn't around. Turned out he just liked the chase, because the moment I started reciprocating things he figured out that he did not actually want to be more than friends. He just liked the flirting, gaming, and hanging out parts. It felt like some sort of twisted game, definitely a disaster. So I vanished like a rogue from his life. People are cruel. Being single is much less complicated. Make sure you keep your heart locked up with the key worn on a chain around your own neck.
Who is the waiter???
❤ I love you.  Good luck with your concert tonight 🎉
Is he gay? I cant understand.
I LOVE THISDS

wait so are all the different scenes like all of the dates hes been on?? like he said at the starrttttt
I love this music video
If you saw when he drew onto the window of the car. At 2:34. He drew the Arabic for Allah. It might have been a coincidence, but that’s exactly the famous spelling of Allah. ❤❤❤. Mashallah.
MAYBE I'M MISTAKENNN
I pride myself on the fact my hair looks like Conan’s 🥲
Y’all is the waiter single 😍
The overthinking part. Most relateable part. Actually all of it and then thinking of reasons to backpeddle when u confess and they don’t say I I love you after
Currently going through this situation 🥲
🤍
Nice
" just left the party at Blake's and it's Halloween..." And to think I almost went all Halloween without listening to this masterpiece
I am about to ask the love of my life out. This is my anthem.
De mis favoritas❤
I am desperate so I keep going on dates I don’t really like hoping I’ll grow into them- so I just end up feeling like a player
0:51 i bought his album and he exposed me like this omg
The date with the girl and her dad was funny 😂
Gay**

Miracle magic disaster

Is it just me or does anyone else love how he talks? liek i love the when he says "brunch".... OML.
I am, OFFICIALLY RELATE TO CONAN!
As an Aquarius - I can relate😅
I wanna be yours I love ''You'' I just love u yeh....... that's alllllllllll haha that's funny I'm just keep day dreaming u and me hugging at a cafe just a fool .........right?
As a person who got into a relationship for one day...yupp just for one day...i feel this song
happy first birthday superache <3 🌹🥀
i have three different interpretations for this song and i can't figure out which it is;  1) They were both friends and took the relationship to a next level only to realise they don't like each other like that and its ruining their friendship 2) He thought they were becoming more than friends but the other person didn't see it like that 3) He thought he was in love but slowly realised his feelings were based on the idea he had of them
I can relate to this song on many levels. Conans songs are always so timeless to me💜✨
Total mood!
🖤🖤🖤
Using this for my Sirius Black edit
❤
Is he gay ?🌞
His voice is soo smoothing 😭😭😭🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡
Yo te amo conan 😭😭 tus canciones son increíbles

could anyone else see what is written in 2:33?
I swear all of Conan’s music videos end in disaster (no pun intended)
🤢🤮
This is like crush culture but " now I'm 20 and I hate it and in college" or I'm projecting hard af.
This gives me Taylor vibes. Breaking stuff and being crazy. And man I love it.
Is it purely platonic to call me like every night?🙂
This is the best representation of young love ong

His music is always amazing, it never disappoints me!
The hook makes me think of Frou Frou.  I miss her music..”Must Be Dreamin’”.
Only bad thing about this song is how soon it ends 😥
“Don’t date him, he is mental (or what she said) “  CAUGHT IN 4K DIEING ON THE GROUND💀💀💀💀💀💀👹
the "ok damn it's 9 am" THAT T-SWIFT REFERENCE YAALLLL
OMG😭 This is so me, we can relate
Ashley believes that there’s something between you & I ✨💌💖🫶
Another masterpiece
Lol what a shit friend tho. I'd smack her for ruining my chance on of all occasions, my safe-space brunch.

Wonderful
this is garbage
Amo essa música
This song is describing self sabotage
Guys, I think I'm in love with Conan Gray.

The title card says "Episode 3", but what are the first two episodes?
Adorable canção e vídeo!❤😍💚
I really like this guy, Conan Gray. Nice name too♥️🤩

This my song, period. I feel the connection in a spiritual way
Legao.bom.dia

I prefere Conan the Barbarian...
Amor e u..te..amo tanto.  Na.terra. Não   existe nada. Para.  Comparar beijos  meu. Coracao
Meu amorzinho. Tk

Who else in his\her ✨CONAN GRAY ERA✨.....😭❤
MY SISTER GOT TO GO TO HIS CONCERT AND I DIDNT, IM SO JEALOUS. 😭
Halloween... I prefer Valentines.
let me just lose my mind 😁
it’s brunch 😒
One of my favorite conan gray songs
٢:٣٤
its either olivia rodrigo is the new conan gray, or conan gray is the new olivia rodrigo
A música pra quelas pessoas qu gosta de ser perfeio(a)
2:23😶  I only one knew what he wrote in the window
It's really understandable there are a lot of people who've gotten many relationships over, and than when they're beginning another one... they immediately get so afraid :(
This always happens when you got a lot of expectations wich are not real, if you're dating someone, just throw the dice on the table and let them roll ;) Wish you break a leg 😊
This is the song for overthinker people
❤‍🔥
"You know Ashley believes that there's something between you and I."                                            -Conan Gray
saggitarius to saggitarius i feel the same🥲
You best believe I bought the vinyl the SECOND I got the chance ❤️❤️
I just sent a part of this music to (*the person*) Don't care anymore  Note: (*the person*) didn't reply :D
Is that a male or female?
Conan keep on making super music . ..try too keep your soul doing so . Bye.
He’s not just a song writer 🥸🥸He’s a storyteller 🤯🤯😪😪
Okay but why does he remind me of Klaus from the umbrella academy XD
He’s bi?
obsessed
Conan’s shirt at 0:52 has me crying with laughter 😭
My ex's name is Blake 💀
Conan finding that people are psychotic and problematic, and then displaying the same vibes back when he’s had enough>>>>>>>>>
I wish I could find better relationships
My current and past relationships are disasters as well
He looks like the male version of Olivia rodrigo
I want to eat Conans hair
HI MISS EVERYTHING!!! HOW ARE YOU TO FIND OUT? 😀🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
so hes gay? we finally know
set the scene I just left the party at Blake's and it's Halloween Had the keys to my car in my hand, but I didn't leave 'Cause the potential of us, it was keepin' me up all night long I left a text you won't read all night long  This could be a disaster, there's so many factors Like, what if you freak out and then we're losin' it all At the critical chapter where I say, "I love you" And you don't say it after This could be a disaster, I'm pedaling backwards By saying that I'm drunk, I really shouldn't have called I'm a little bit plastered, you call me a liar Now I'm fallin' in faster This could be a disaster  disaster (Oh) disaster  lose my mind Is it purely platonic to call me, like, every night? You know Ashley believes that there's somethin' between you and I But if I'm readin' it wrong, man, it'd be better off if I died, oh And if you're readin' the text all night long  This could be a disaster, there's so many factors Like, what if you freak out and then we're losin' it all At the critical chapter where I say, "I love you" And you don't say it after This could be a disaster, I'm pedaling backwards By saying that I'm drunk, I really shouldn't have called I'm a little bit plastered, you call me a liar Now I'm fallin' in faster This could be a disaster  disaster (Oh) disaster  Maybe I'm mistaken (oh) You're not mine for takin' (oh) Maybe I'm mistaken Maybe I just made it up, messed it up
Can anyone stop vibing for a moment and appreciate how good conan sings?  He's legendary and its not a bit exaggerated. I LOVE HIS SONGS <3
Boring song
Something about conan's music videos is so addictive I keep watching them and the lyrics are just like someone took the words and worries straight out of my mind
just gone 17/8/6 on hecarim and only got 12lp. GG
Happy late birthday Conan, I love you and your music! ❤️❤️❤️

God, god, god, this song make me feel in the moon
metro station vibes
Hey everyone you are loved and not alone. God loves you and you are not alone.
who else found Conan from Joey graceffa shouting him out in like 2017
Not quite.  On the contrary.
he just like me fr
Conan's songs and videos always make me feel better.
Mi rola
Iam good without any relationships I eat healthy Study to my collage Go to gym Sleep 8 hrs Hang Out with my freinds Iam good
It's my anxiety singing
My favorite part was when he was beating the guitar on the ground. That was glorious.
He said: "I don't know if they're even trying."
HOW DID I NOT KNOW THERE WAS A MV FOR THIS SONG
Bu şarkının klibini çok seviyorum, çok eğlenceli geliyor.
I love how conan is always between roasting all the couples on earth and suffering because he has not that ahahah
good song❤
OMG THIS IS THA BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I CAN'T<33
Its all about me too 🥲🔥
I feel like someone made a song about my instagram chat
Con semejante mesero, yo me quedaría mirándolo igual😍
conan brunch is not eaten at 9am.
As a guy who goes from one relationship to another always thinking about disasters! this song makes me feel like it was meant for me…
Is he gay?
Who wishes his bestie Olivia Rodrigo was in this video???
Ok I'm not scared to date I have a crush he likes me too but I'm scared to ask him out and he's shy so what if he don't answer
O maior!
i love u Conan. I am actually the waiter

"and it's Halloween"
“I just left that party at Blake’s and it’s Halloween” this line hits different tonight 🎃

Conan has such a good Taylor Swift vibes the best swiftie
POV: Me listening to this song but it is only 2 days `till halloween.
Saben que es lo q más me gusta de Conan? Es q en cada una de sus canciones y vídeos musicales siempre algo especial que hacer q la canción se destaque y por supuesto la linda letra. #superachethebestalbum

Is conan gay?
Every single person before dating 😂😂😂
I love you Conan !
Should change your name to Conan Gay, because it sounds more fruity
Omg I play this song in 0.75 speed and it hit differently and amazing!
so funny story:  my best friend and i are a bit of a complicated pair and i’ve been in love with him for months- so one day i just sent him this song and said “this song is my thoughts about us” and he was “the fact you think i wouldn’t say it back”   my best friend and i are now dating
😂😂😂❤
"its nine am" *Sunlight*
I love the way he says *br-unch*
I LOVE YOU THIS IS SO GOOD
¿KSVL? PHONK

I like the Taylor reference in the beginning
OMG THIS IS SO GOOD
🔥🔥

kemioくんのYouTubeを見て、この曲を知りました☺️ そして何回もリピートして聴いています🥰 この曲に出会えて良かった😊2人に感謝😁

yo wtf! this actually goes crazy
Necesitas el reconocimiento que mereces, tu música es de otro nivel
luv you!!!!!💞💞
bro is beautiful
The love of my life
At 02:33 , Conan writes الله on the window of the car, I wondered what he wanted to tell his purpose. Btw ı am müsliman.
I think this is the most relatable album I've ever heard
The part where man’s hot boxed a Prius 😂😂😂😂
He’s amazing!! So underrated it’s insane! I love everything about him <33
kslv?
This fuckin horrible lol.
No because this is way too true 😭 I'm so paranoid I see all the res flags and ignore any green ones. I'm afraid to get hurt.
Damn
コナン大好き♡
I'm straight for Conan
Let my just
OH MY GOD I LOVE CONAN THIS IS AMAZING
So attractive with long hair 😍
I kinda wonder if the relationships portrayed in the video ever actually happened?
pov: you start a new series and get a fictional crush
♡♡♡
It is so interesting how this song has such devastating lyrics but at the same time an absolute bop that you can jump around to
been 3 days and it's still stuck in my head, this is crazy😭😭
🔥🔥
I HOPE EVERY MUSLIM SEES THIS. The name of Allah was found in this music video 2:35 . I'm not sure if he meant to write 'help,' but it was edited to look like Allah's name. But still I want every muslim give your thoughts about this so please share your thoughts on this particular case.
アルバムの中で一番好きな曲
He wrote Allah on the car window and my friend is muslim and Allah is his God name اللہ so he disrespect muslims religion Just slow down the video on 2 .34 then see
😍
I LOOOOVVEEEEE THIS SONG 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
LOL THE START SEEMS LIKE SOME COMEDY DRAMA OR SUM ITS SO FUNNY THE WAY THEY MOVE THE CAMERAS TOO IS PERFECT
Noooooooo!!!!! Not the guitar!!! 😭 💔  Smash glasses instead 😛
Noooooooo!!!!! Not the guitar!!! 😭 💔  Smash glasses instead 😛
For God so loved the world that he gave his one & only Son that whoever believes in him shall not perish But have eternal life. (John 3:16)✝️
I dare you to make a bad song

I sat between my 2 divorced friends at a beautiful wedding🌹and said this is how every divorce starts 🥴i get it
Mtv vma 2022!
My life is just a Conan Gray song tbh
Conan Gray is such an icon for singles ( and I mean single since birth not like you just brokr up or somehting )  Also an icon for virgins . Conan listening to your songs is like reading my diary and it makes me feel good that m not the only one

my safe place
SLAYYYYY
Crush culture: who are you?  Disaster: I'm you but stronger
I love the bi representation ✨️💗🌈 thank you for being outloud Conan ✨️
Alternatively titled: Conan pretending to be interested in girls for 3 minutes
waiter: what- I-  is he okay?? Conan's Friend: He's just zoning out, he does that frequently.. uh, you shouldn't date him. Waiter: oh, I see. He zones out frequently? Conan: literally singing his life  3 minutes later  Waiter: uhm.. it's been 3 minutes. Conan's friend: *you shouldn't date him.*
blank spacee gıdıcem

I think that the WOOSH at the end would have been great in the song.
Miss everything??

The ending😭😭
Great job
it was indeed a disaster, conan.
Does anyone know who plays the waiter?

Literally obsessed
He's also dating men? I just get it ^^ Damn, this generation is so open-minded and fluid, love it ;)
I want none of this shit
Oh my god. this song. Pure art
ash and cone cooking show
His "Disaster" sounds like Jk´s voice. Conan is an fantastic singer!!!!!
I love this song because a lot of people can relate about like the continuous worries in a relationship
مقدر استوعب ذا القدر من الابداع البومهه فخممم
what's the name of the waiter? haha just curious
Another masterpiece
Conan's wardrobe is my future wardrobe goals. He's probably the sole reason I love white socks
ياجماعه كنه كتب"  الله " على شباك السياره !!!!!!!!!
This was so cool wow
The best sad song album everrrrrrrrr!!! (My album’s out today btw) 😭💔
Just he writes ""Allah "" on the window of the car >>>
Yesssss ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤍🤎💔
3:15 me when my teacher tells me to read out loud

I literally shared your songs with two of my friends and now they are obsessed with your songs I luv this song
O my god I love you Conan you are my faveriote singer in the whole world your so amazing
He is messing w/ my sexuality 👹 I’m now pan
Great Song, Love it!
I just saw Conan's "I'm Conan" video... Sooo cute I'm cooing so much at that video. I can so feel why he turned off the comments hahahahahha wholesome
When you start catching feelings for a boy on snap....
Here
“All night long..”I love his voice
*Dear person who may be reading this* . . 👇 *You’re amazing stay blessed, stay safe and have a amazing rest of your day*
#عنب_بناتي   show one 😊
He's totaly infp
Wuaua eres increíble broo
This song makes me feel good don’t know how to explain exactly
You have zero talent live, it's a good thing you can use voice modulation in the studio.
Conan, you need to come to Western Australia!!!!!
If you really want to know what a disaster is, listen to this snowflake sing the Star Spangled Banner. https://youtu.be/JBmd4OaE4iM
Him singing the national anthem was a "Disaster" Even autotune couldn't fix that apocalyptic disaster. No talent.
All overthinkers with relationship phobia gathered here. Damn...this is painfully relatable.
Conan Gray out here hitting us personally
“Superache is for virgins” yes sir
メロディーが最高に好き...
Ode of the Overthinker....and yes, Overthinking is a Superpower...where is the cape for that?  We may not have a cape but now, we have a song. 😉🦸‍♂️🎵  LOL
Conan: superache is for virgins yo: sisoi🤑☝️
my favorite song ever bro
When I first heard of Conan,I was like "what the hell"! Now,I realize my assumptions were wrong! I really love his take on music and his reality and how he presents everything  in his videos...I really like disaster because "bi---h" I've definitely been in these shoes!!😊 ❤️ love Conan a bunch!!!
SLAYED FR
BEAUTİFUL.
id like to apologize because i thought this was Ezra Miller at first
Yall baseball fans need to get over him singing the national anthem, people sang worse then him 💀
Is this voice everyone expected at the HomeRun Derby?
I'm a baseball fan, please , never do that again, thank you
Where's the national anthem song 😂🤣😂🫠🫣
AYA one love ❤️
Bro I am obsessed with him he and Olivia inspire me sooo much especially Conan!
using this as a filler for world by seventeen. the difference in mood and vibes :(
Conan you are truly a blessing and talent!! Btw this has been my favorite song on the album since before it was released ❤️❤️🔥🔥also this song really speaks to me because I’m afraid of getting in relationships and have some commitment issues
i love you're music
Disaster. Is this song referring to his national anthem performance?
This guy just tried to sing the national anthem before the HR Derby and he sucks
This generation is going to be a disaster
1:29 Viewers: are you dating with his daughter or with her father? Conan: yes
who is the waitress in the beginning?
Don’t quit your day job to become an actor 😅😅😅😅😅😅
I hope we're related - cuz this guy, Conan, Iz a talented Artist - Oh, and, apparently, Hez funnY
1:29 we not gonna talk about his fake smile it was soooo goooddd
I love you so much conan gray 🥺❤😭💗😚😋🤗
I like how fun the music video is cause the song is so sad honestly
so fucking insanely good
i just wanna give conan a big hug. i love him.
サビに入る前の一瞬音楽が止まる感じたまらなくすき毎日聴いてます幸🤭🎧🤍

ele nunca desaponta, mds
Disaster is my favorite song of Superache, it's simply amazing💖✨
Conan grey I can never stop listening to you ❤️❤️❤️😘 https://youtu.be/A8cHNJ5GP4w
テレビで生歌を聞いて感動しました！ 日本から応援してます🔥  I heard this song on Japanese TV！！ His voice is so beautiful🫶
歌声がめちゃくちゃ好きだった😊💓💓💓
How I learned who Conan is, is from those cringey gacha videos with Heather in them it’s a pretty funny way how I found him but ever since then I have been a huge fan! Also I’m someone who is just full on scared to date so this song is relatable :)
Levanten la mano si son fans latinos de Conan
disaster is for the overthinkers
This is BRILLIANT
CONAN T AMO MUCHO, GRACIAS POR EXISITIR
عندي سؤال ليش كتب الله ع زجاج السيارة ؟
Brunch 💫
존나 좋아
I like u because yr special
Great tune but I'm too distracted by the guitar. Did it break or not?
Is Conann gray a gay?
This might be THE most relatable thing I've ever heard in my entire life-
I know if I watch enough Conan o' Brien's video, youtube will eventually recommend Conan Gray's video to me. So here I am
Conan es tan hermoso  <3

i've been here since sunset season first came out, and it's honestly amazing how far conan has come. his fame is well deserved, and he's an amazing creator.  p.s; loved the mention of ashely, i miss the ash & cone cooking show sm haha
9am is not brunch. Other than that, no complaints.
I didn’t know Conan was gay
I love his voice and this catchy song. There's some magic and magnetism in him.

Wow... that was literally me playing all those scenes in my mind when I see somebody new and start making a film out of it haha... But then comes the saddest part: when I  get conscious of it... that I was just daydreaming a movie in my head 💀💔
I love your style 😍
The beginning low key reminded me of crush culture
Wow!!💛
I'm homophobic but Conan's the only gay person I'll accept. good music especially idle town
woww l love this song just wowww
Conan love… I wish I could’ve met you when I was a little younger. You’re cute as  ever, A smile to die for ( I have a teeth thing lol), a panty dropper voice and seem like a friggen blast to just grocery shop with. Oh oh oh and that long hair is working for you babe. You are my perfectly imperfect guy. Of course when Im way to old to date at all it seems! The new album is TOP NOTCH! Your song overdrive could literally be my theme song when I was younger and falling in love. Total Deja-vu. Stay awesome!
Conan MERECE más reconocimiento porque tiene DEMASIADO talento
So funny
this is an actual masterpiece!
ART!!!!!!!! LEGEND CONAN GRAY
I just left the party at Blake's and it's Halloween Had the keys to my car in my hand, but I didn't leave 'Cause the potential of us, it was keepin' me up all night long I left a text you won't read all night long This could be a disaster, there's so many factors Like, what if you freak out and then we're losin' it all At the critical chapter where I say, "I love you" And you don't say it after This could be a disaster, I'm pedaling backwards By saying that I'm drunk, I really shouldn't have called I'm a little bit plastered, you call me a liar Now I'm fallin' in faster This could be a disaster disaster (Oh) disaster lose my mind Is it purely platonic to call me, like, every night? You know Ashley believes that there's somethin' between you and I But if I'm readin' it wrong, man, it'd be better off if I died, oh And if you're readin' the text all night long This could be a disaster, there's so many factors Like, what if you freak out and then we're losin' it all At the critical chapter where I say, "I love you" And you don't say it after This could be a disaster, I'm pedaling backwards By saying that I'm drunk, I really shouldn't have called I'm a little bit plastered, you call me a liar Now I'm fallin' in faster This could be a disaster disaster (Oh) disaster Maybe I'm mistaken (oh) You're not mine for takin' (oh) Maybe I'm mistaken Maybe I just made it up, messed it up
Ahhhhhh this song hits me so much to the point that I want to cry 😔😔😔
I know it’s a personal subject and I’m not here to judge or trying to figure out someone sexuality, but at the same time after watching this video was this his way of coming out as bi??
مش ملاحظ انك بتحاول تاخد قلبي بصراحه كدا اوفر وكتشير بصراحه
It’s ✨BrUnCh
why there is have to be the "allah" in arabic font in the car?? i dont get it, please someone explain to me
Every car scene is so relatable omg-
Ok so in the intro when he says "ok damn it 9 am" is that a nod to Taylor swift's song You Need to calm down where she sings "damn it's seven a.m."?
فالدقيقه ٢:٣٥ كتب الله ولا عيني فيها شيء 🙃
Can someone explain lol. Is he on dates with the people?
Love this song!!! 💗
Same Conan, same.
Jxjdfj
"God I hate couples" what a great start😃👍🏼
sad
is he gay??
Need that “superache is for virgins” shirt
I LOVE U
Uh Connie
Greatest singer
MY BEST BOY
God I’m so proud
mid
I love you so much conan
0:27
Did he write allah?
Wait did no one realize what he wrote on the glass???????????
Superache had got to be one of the best albums I had ever listened to this summer and I’m also so excited to see his tour in September in Moon Township, PA
WAIT WTF THIS IS SOO GOOD
Dam, its 9 am - conan gray  Me everyday
WHY ARE THE BEST SONGS ALWAYS SO SHORT 😭💖🔥
The way that I so relate to this except the “Ashley believes that there’s something between you and I”, ‘cause I haven’t told my friends about my being in love
Yet another incredibly relatable song from Conan that captures something so perfectly (and a great video to go with)
This. Is. So. Good.
So bad
Conan how about music videos for all Superache tracks:))))
why did this music video and her speech come to personally attack me??
Why does this hit so different at 3 am, god I love this song
day 1 of asking conan gray if he could do a show in NYC
QUE BUENA CANCIÓN LPM
you only like this song because you feel indentified with it
💗💛💙
eu amo tanto ele
Reminder to everyone here: "psychotic" used in that way is extremely harmful to people with psychosis. Misusing medical terms in a demonizing way or as synonyms for bad things is incredibly harmful. People with psychosis are not harmful or evil or whatever. It's clear a lot of people have no clue what it actually even is
Wow OK I really like Conan Grayyy and his musicc and his voice and his personality. BIG FAN.
if he ever did a collab with troye Sivan I’d be complete
hi
I discovered you for the first time, you gave me chill and catchy vibes! 😎
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Holy shit, you seem genuinely so happy in this music video! Really cool to see. Great song as usual :)
Conan miamor te rezo, q temazo❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
best era of his hair :)) he is so pretty
Conan don’t be shy link the waiter’s socials cause goddamn he’s fine
definitely and most certainly have the shirt that dad character is wearing.
hey
I love the “superache is for virgins” TShirt 😭
I wonder if the “Damn. It’s 9 AM” is a reference to Taylor’s lyrics in YNTCD
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
As an anxious person with complicated relationships there is no better song to represent me🥲❤️
Wow this guy has a great voice. I never heard of him but I’m in the waiting room reading a people magazine article about him and decided to check out who he is
such a good song omg
O Conan é incrível em tudo que faz💜
Wow conan is really good!!! I love U
Is it just me that noticed what he wrote on the car window 😳?!?
Haha the before + after scenes were super fun to watch
Idk if it's just me but did his bestie sabotage him at the end?
Conans mv vibe and conans hair omg
Who else agrees Conan should make merch??? Plzzzz I would buy ur merch. Every song of yours is amazing literally listening to every song rn. And no I don't listen to ur songs till 1 am lol
set the scene I just left the party at Blake's and it's Halloween Had the keys to my car in my hand, but I didn't leave 'Cause the potential of us, it was keepin' me up all night long I left a text you won't read all night long This could be a disaster there's so many factors Like, what if you freak out and then we're losin' it all at The critical chapter where I say, "I love you" And you don't say it after This could be a disaster, pedaling backwards By saying that I'm drunk, I really shouldn't have called I'm a little bit plastered, you call me a liar Now I'm fallin' in faster This could be a disaster Oh-oh-oh, disaster Oh-oh-oh, disaster lose my mind Is it purely platonic to call me, like, every night?

Disaster (At The Cafe) Episode 3: Conan Tries Dating (he Is The Promblem)

wait but what’s the name of the waiter 👀
I want a BTS. Now. Please.
to mutch gay for me
Kichu manusher Ovinoy dekhe shob bhule gechi
Conan Mercury
The timing of this song being released is horrifying. A little background: a little more than a month ago I got a job at a banquet hall as a waiter. Really fun, love working there. I got different trainers on my first and second night because that's how its suppose to be, you get multiple perspectives on how to do the job. On my 3rd, 4th, and 5th night I got the same trainer. She will remain anonymous but she's a really good friend of mine now and everyone at work things there's something between us. THE WEIRD PART IS one of our co workers WHO IS BEST FRIENDS WITH THIS TRAINER IS NAMED ASHLEY. WHATS GOING ON. We FaceTime almost every night and it is purely platonic but wow this song is reading my life.
A self-sabotage anthem and im here for it
this song could have been a disaster but it isn't !! Love you
aku jealous ngn kau
kau kental sia
bruh pick me
AMAZING
So, finally I have a song that perfectly describes my life...
i love this omg
this is so beautifuuuul, i´m crying <3
I made an original song myself and you were one of my inspiration
lmao I’m adicted to this music video
MEU DEUS EU FALEI
If this song isn't the voice of this generation?!?!!!! I can totally relate to every last word!!!
Loved it so muuuuuch 🥰
same feeling hahahahah
Does someone know the waiter's name? He kinda cute.
This song makes me feel free 💃💃💃
i love you con
CONAN IN A CRYSTAL CROWN  CONAN IN A CRYSTAL CROWN  CONAN IN A CRYSTAL CROWN  CONAN IN A CRYSTAL CROWN  CONAN IN A CRYSTAL CROWN  CONAN IN A CRYSTAL CROWN
💜💜💜
Conan Gray is my mood, his songs always connects with what I'm feeling 😭
I love u, this song soooooooooo good. 💗💗💗💗💗💗🌻🌻
"Superache is for virgins" lol true
Can we just appreciate how conan’s shirt says, “superache is for virgins” 😭👀
So relate. I tend to overthink too much before it even happen. That is how we cope, I suppose. From the coming disaster, I mean.
conan is seriously the prettiest human being to ever exist <3
This is so Charlie Spring
So cool how the music video is a perfect loop lol. I actually had the song on loop and that ending immediately struck me. "What was I saying again?" - "God I hate couples." :D Props for that, love it!
OMG! He is so good. Can't believe he hasn't been doing this for years.
the “superache is for virgins” tshirt had me CRYING LAUGHING
My new fav song, iam going to listen to this over and over and over again , love you conan 🌷
was this filmed at griffith park in LA?
Omg, something just relate 🤣🤣
BEST ALBUM I LOVE THIS
te amo conan
This music video is amazing😂
Woooow geniaal
Great song but respectively....who brunches at 9am
Luv u nan .. beautiful and talented
i wish he would make a whole album with this type of vibe and upbeat. i really love it ! this, maniac, telepath, and overdrive are so good. Anyone know other songs that are like this ?
The subtle reference to "You need to  calm down" by Taylor at the beginning tho!  "Damn, it's 7am"
Xd
Time marches on, yet nothing has changed. Conan was me at that age: our own saboteurs.
Why am i just seeing this Absolutely amazing , an absolute masterpiece Everything about this is so amazing omg
Conan Gray is one of the greatest artist of this generation. Dead ass and one I’ll make a song with him. But for right now I’m in my YouTube era and I’ll just sit back and  be a fan.
"damn its 9am" haha taylor reference
My favourite song and album this year AMAZING
you are SPOILING us <3
i feel like this song takes place right after "wish you were sober" THE LYRICS MATCH UP
and that's on self composing. the emotions through the whole album (and even his whole discography) feel so raw and connectedand so fcking relatable- gosh, i really love this artist.
Love u
L friend tho cant believe she said that about conan at the end
god i remember watching cone when i was in middle school and i would download all of his songs from his channel, from lovesick boys to his debut of idle town and crush culture. sad he didn’t continue his vlogs but its so amazing to see his growth in his music and creativity in his music videos 🤍🍊
this reminded me of how much i miss my parents Ash and Cone 🥲
The chorus reminds me a lot of Bad Kids by Lady Gaga
at 2:34 does he write "Allah"??
are yall hotboxing tobacco
so slay
The ending and the buildup of the relationship scenes just shows how all of this anxiety and overthinking just piles on top of each other which continues to lead to bad relationships with friends and partners.
Give conan his own series ✨ HAHA
i relate so much to this song
Conan Gray is so fckin good.. he is a truly inspiring artist to me and has motivated me to release my first music video. It's out on my channel now, it's a bit different than this but I hope some of you might enjoy it. To anyone that takes the time to check it out and show support, you make my day and I appreciate you!!!!  <3
❤️❤️❤️ so good
elite
omfg Conan i luv ur music so much😭this totally what I'm thinking everyday even though i never experience relationship in my entire life I'm 100 percent sure I'm afraid😂😭luv u
"you dont want to date him he has SERIOUS commitment issues" why is that so relatable lol
This>>>>>>>>
I wanted to tell how much I like u, but...this could be a disaster!   Gosh! This song is perfect!!
Its ✨brunch✨
Why he wrote the word Allah الله on the glass!!! 2:35
2:15 he's ripping his own album cover
9a.m is not brunch
Loveeeee this sooo much
i love this
Awesome tune u came with bro
I love it the song ✨🧠
Lots of love from India🇮🇳🇮🇳
This song is a bop. By the way, is this a sign that he's coming out to us? Cause the music video is a little suspicious
No but me
Friend: You’re just mad you’re clinically single Conan: Ok, damn 😂😂😂
So much talent man I appreciate all the hard work that went into this song and video
I love it so much, from the writing to the plot  <3 The music video kinda reminds me of Taylor Swift's "Mine". But this one focuses more on the what ifs of the relationship. I love how similar and different both the music videos are <333
it’s so interesting how conan’s music videos always had this special vibe to them, they’re all funny and stylish but something about them (and the songs) is so sad and lonely that you end up watching with mixed feelings   and i think that this contrast is what makes them so alive, cause that’s life - laughing and making art about the most traumatising stuff, isn’t it? ly conan ur the best
The worst scenario here is the one in the car with someone smoking. I hate inhaling the smoke even in open air, what more in that!
Conan has good acting skills too! Cast Conan!
Superache is really sooo good. No skip!
always on his king shit
CONAN we’re all so proud. you’ve made so many musical and lyrical advancements since sunset season, it’s admirable
I am obsessed  Your voice Your hair  Your personality  Your creativity  Everything about you is amazing
Literally why does Conan make such relatable lyrics. Also the way this feels like Crush Culture’s working professional self such an elite evolution
Hey everyone Jesus loves you
Cansionsota! La amé!
This is my new on loop song
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
the waiter is so familiar yet i cant name him🤔
Nailed it👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
d
Gosh I love his voice and him. I'm not a man or an adult yet or gay but gosh I just want us to be in love with each other.😍
conan te amo ♥
I’m gonna need Superache is for virgins shirt as merch
The “superache is for virgins” on his shirt 😭
I am the target demographic. I’ve never felt so seen in my lide
a escuchar la traducción e identificarme 😊❤ jajaja
WOWOOWOWWOO SOO GOOD
conan went from ruining other people's dates in Crush Culture to ruining his own here, gosh! XD
okay, damn
Gooooooodd
His voice is heaven
This song explains how my mind works<3
this song is soo good
This is my fave Conan song ever
مدري شوكت تشتهر من تشتهر رجعوني
Amazing video. Nice storytelling. Thank you for sharing the world.
Love song
what's the name of that cute waiter guy?
حلوووووووه
الأغنية تجننننن
a song about my pain. nice bro. lmaoooooooo
i accidentally disliked this im gonna go cry for the rest of my life 😭😭😭
Conan never fails
The moment when he started with "Let me just," I love the song already!
Noooo, the girl shouldn't sabotage Conan like that😭
He never let me down , totally masterpiece
The way he narrates more than he sings is addictive
I REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY LOVEEEEE THIS FCKINGGG SONGG
People are sleeping on this song ITS SO GOOD
0:33   Why is Junko there lol?
The waiter guy too cute he left me stunned too... I'll definitely be free
As a compulsive overthinker I really appreciate this song
Girl who has brunch at 9am that’s breakfast lmao
Conan
2:35 am I seeing this right?😃
Conan is so underrated
1:33 is that Angela? 🧐
WHY ISNT ANYONE TALKING ABOUT HIS SHIRT AT 1:14
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🧨🧨🧨🧨
عسل
Conan ur the disaster we always wanted❤️
<3
OMG this song is about Me! 🤭❤️🤣🤣
this song gives me Taylor Swift vibes
Conehead
Damn it’s 9AM YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN
ig del mesero 🤨
Ditch your bff dude she obviously gonna ruin ANY potential relationships
Never have I ever been in a relationship, done anything with anyone, and I also get the commitment issues so thank you for this it’s like I’m singing to myself.l it’s so powerful. Everyone takes their time to have these experiences so never pressure or rush yourself. The time will come :) also yes superache is for virgins and I’m one of them
el pibe re bonito invitandolo  conan despues de media hora imaginandose cosas random mirando a el infinito muy buena cancion ame el instrumental la vibra de la voz muy buena y magnifica
I really do love Conan Gray's music. I've already added his album to my playlist. LOL
Yeahey this beat again 🎼🎶🎵 Love from Philippines ❤️💋😀🇵🇭
VIBE!!!
friend thanks nike
conan yo te amo desde que sacaste generation why 😭
THIS IS WAY TOO GOOD ❤️❤️
i am obsessed
Conan never fails to impress me.
Amo tanto las canciones de conan
2:32 DID HE WRITE ALLAH  IN ARABIC ON THE GLASSS?
THE CLOTHE USED FROM CONAN AT MINUTE 1:30 IT'S SO PRETTY!<3
CONGRATULATIONS CONAN!
FANTASTIC! I LOVE SO MUCH THIS MUSIC. I DON'T HAVE MORE WORLDS TO DESCRIBE THIS MUSIC, BECAUSE IT'S SO COOL <3
PERFECT!
your teeth are so attractive
i think the disaster is that Conan lost some brain cells "9AM ---- Its brunch"
Conan not being able to break the guitar in one of his dates despite so desperately wanting to is my everything atm
conannnnn
♡
I didn't skip
OMG
I loved that you shared Ashley's thought❤️😉
I hate 💑 to (well some) 😂💃🏼🔥
Who is the cast of that waiter in this Music Video???
that's the night stalker
Love the Taylor Swift reference, "Damn, it's 9am"
ahH... whAt wAs i WaS sAyiNg aGaIn?
*Analiza al que le pide la cita* 🤨
Conan speaks my mind all the time
Omg I love him <3
I’m literally screaming how could I forget that this was coming out ❤️❤️
I love everything about this, but I can`t with Conan having brunch at 9am hahaha
Amo demasiado los vibes que da las canciones de conan gray
Awesome as always 👌👌
Lovely human<3
I know NOTHING about him except that he looks super sweet with his fans because I saw a tiktok made by one of them and here I am (also he has curly hair like me so he already gets a point)
When ur Ashley and a tarot reader
Conan would be such a great actor
Go bald for pheonix
This is so good but i expected something bigger 💔 Conan deserves all the best
never fails to make us laugh, cry, and vibe out at the same time :)
the ultimate sequel to crush culture
banger
كتب "الله" ؟ 2:34
Esto está fuego👉🔥https://youtu.be/nAwWqC9GYgM
his so cute ❤
I relate way too much 2 Conan's songs lmao. I should probably work on these issues before i end up dying alone lmao
<3
https://youtu.be/NMlv21zGARM
WHAT HAPPENED 😭😭😭😭
As usual, Conan never disappoints us!
The witchy one was so cute istg
just wow
what was I saying again? Definitely funny:)
my new “wish you were sober” type of obsession
this song is perfect.
vibes 80's
Conan 😭 you just like me
The casual mention of ashley *sobs harder*
Pppevre then p my keep
Umm this is not KSLV Disaster but the song sound good.
Love from india
❤️‍🔥
¡¡¡Tremenda obra de arte!!!
No Conan Grays were harmed in the making of this video.
Jesus loves you with all His heart and if you feel alone call on His name for He is close to the broken hearted ❤
the mention of ashley!!!!!!!! haha i loveddd
this album is literally conans diary and how he feels on a day to day basis about the same bullshit, very well done cone :] fav song off the album btw
I know some dont want to hear this but it needs to be said..For the rapper, drug dealer, prostitute, homosexual, partier, fornicator, drinker, drug user..Jesus is willing to accept you just the way you are.. Jesus died for all those and every sin and all a person has to do is believe he died or all your sins (past present and future) and you are justified in the eyes of God and will have a relationship with him forever
He wrote "الله ""Allah " "GOD " in 2:33 or should I go to the doctor!!?
I don't want to hold myself back with unhelpful logical reasonings made by my mind. I'm gonna go behind what thrills me, ignoring the multiple reasons I can't do it. Cause 1 reason is enough to want me want it, and that one reason is enough to keep me up at night regretting, if I don't go behind it.
Lmao the tarot cards are accurate to the song  The tower The devil Nine of wands Ten of wands reversed
Solo es mi opinión pero el chico del principio y del final tiene un aire a taehyung 😨😨
What an absolute piece of rubbish. Can't believe the ridiculous comments here. No talent.
OH MY GOD! i can't stop listening to superache on reapeat.
I love the dramatic vibe of Conan's music. It's never overdone, it's perfectly encapsulating of the situation. Such a clever writer.
Great song!
Never heard of Conan , and I already love it!
Someone :         Why are you single ?  Me :    I'm conan's fan. 💀
we love the brunch 🤣🤣
Conan Gray finally getting the recognition he deserves! Absolutely great music.
amoooo
Am I the only one that thinks despite him being only 23 he looks and acts beyond his years and such an old soul but also very young at heart.
O
the rumination part of Conan at the end of the video had me
conan is in his emo era and I'm living for it
waitwait?? Did you film this yourself? it says music video by conan gray but I am not sure. ps. VERY VERY WELL DONE
it's so beautiful
La canción me transporta a otro lugar con tan solo oir la letra y  el ritmo, altas ganas de escucharla todo el día ✨🪐❤️
Conan = hair goals
Eres el mejor te amoo
2:35 okay conan what about الله؟💀
That moment when you realize they're eating brunch at 9 A.M.

QUE PERFEITO!!!
THİS SO COOL💕💕

I LOVE THE SYMBOLISM WITH THE TAROT CARDS…THE TOWER, THE DEVIL, THE NINE OF WANDS, AND THE TEN OF WANDS IN REVERSE
Conan never disappoints 😌
This has such hopeless romantic energy that relates to me on a personal level. Thank you for this masterpiece Mr gray 💕
Westen thought black cloth..... Amazing
And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.   (Matthew 24:10-13) - Repent. The LORD Jesus is coming soon.
Conan. A masterpiece.
When you spoke of Ashley it sent be back bestie I miss her so much I know your very busy but I hope y’all still are friends I love ash and cone cooking

This could be the disaster
Conan seems like a very fun, funny and enjoyable person to be around.. like I want to be his friend xD
It's a very good song, I love it and it literally gave me something when I saw that it came out because I just realized how much jsjsjs, but well I love the song :DDD
I love all the scenes in all of his videos in which he acts mad and angry 😂 it makes me laugh the dramacy 🤪💖
Buenisima
Conan: Ah, what was I was saying again?  Me: That, WE, hate couples.😌🤣
Conan gives a very saggittarius and a very pisces vibe
You'd know it's a bop when Julia Michaels cowrites  the track. I fucking love the album. Zero skips. He's such a Swiftie baby ❤️

A Disaster is problematic as it causes us to go into a depressive emotional state. Its bad circumstances, but spirituality is a good mind in bad times.
pls he's so beautiful
What did he write on the car window!? The thing before“sos”!!!!!? I’m flashed rn I hope it’s not what I’m thinking!!!!!!!!!!!!!
💖💖💖
Who wants Cone to start make vlogs again (including music ofc!)??
เห้อ รักโคนันนะ อยากให้มาประเทศไทยบ้าง😔❤️🌹
que joya tan preciosa nos das conan!! Me encata mucho superache/disaster esta muy precioso gracias conita
He who has an ear, let him  Jesus is coming back a lot of people have been ignoring the warnings since 2020 and the only person you’re hurting by doing that is yourself and you’re family   God is doing so much and has done so much for you to wake up and understand the times and season you’re living in so you can repent and be saved   it’s like the days of noah. God sending his servants in love because God loves you to warn you before judgment comes and yes of course human nature   Human beings ignoring God just like the days Noah mockers and scoffers laughing at the preaching of the word  scoffing at the preachers and persecuting those that come in love and share in love   scoffing at the word of God and all this scoffing and mocking even after all that you’ve seen since 2020 and have experienced  Yet everyday life continuing people oblivious to the coming judgement upon this world like the days of noah and ignoring everything that they’ve seen and are seeing   ignoring the fact that there’s a war happening in Ukraine which could potentially lead to nuclear war also ignoring the fact that Israel is about to go to war with Iran and China is about to go to war with Twain   Ignoring the fact that food prices are rising aswell as fuel prices there’s talks of worldwide famines by 2023 new diseases monkeypox after we just had a virus cause havoc on this world for two years and now we have a new one   yet people are choosing to ignore all this signs when the bible told you that this would happen in the last days  A time prophesied by Jesus - a time worser then anything that’s happened  in this world yet you can still be saved out of that time and out of the tribulation and it’s only through Jesus that you can be saved from the wrath to come and from hell and from eternal Separation from God because of you’re sins for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus   you’re in the middle of a spiritual warfare light - against -darkness and you have no idea how great or wicked that darkness is nor what that darkness is doing or planning for you   the Lord Jesus Christ is coming back to judge this world and to put everything right  God’s will is for all to be saved and for none to perish but time is running out this is not the time to be running away from God but rather to God and for my brothers and sisters in Christ   my fellow Christians don’t play church you’re either with Christ or you’re not beloved. Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.  you’re either in the light or in the darkness you’re either on Gods side or Satan’s side beloved Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.  Beloved You have to pick up you’re cross and follow Jesus and deny yourself daily and crucify your flesh daily and be holy because God is holy offer you’re body as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing unto God beloved strive i repeat strive ! to enter through the narrow gate for many will try but will not be able too   This message is shared out of love to everyone so you can be saved   So Repent and give you’re life to Jesus accept him as you’re Lord and saviour and receive forgiveness and salvation through Christ Jesus    Acts 4.12  And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved   John 14:6 6 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me  God bless

just commenting here to say "i love you so much, conan" <3
Ini
I love the ‘superache is for vrigins’ tshirt
Heather introduced me to Conan Gray, and I didn't think I'd get more of his songs even though I had Heather in my playlist, until I heard People Watching. I instantly fell in love with the song and I downloaded as many of Conan's songs as long as I liked them (and that was pretty much all of them). This made me find songs like affluenza, Greek god, checkmate, the cut that always bleeds and a lot of others. The long and short of it, I LOVE YOUR MUSIC AND I'M NOW A MAJOR FAN.  Edit: Wow, I didn't expect this would get so many likes. I just commented and forgot about it.
This beat😃
Does anyone know the other guy is ?
disaster bi king 👑💖💜💙
okay damn its nine am       such a nice rythm

this song is so good, another masterpiece by this amazing artist
on his shirt it says superache is for virgins hahahha i love it
Let’s be real we’ve all been on a date with someone with a guitar who needs to get more personality traits than “I play a guitar”. Not bashing anyone who plays guitar but it’s like anything, don’t make it your whole personality lol
Conan doesn't know how to do a bad song. Period.
I GOT THAT TAYLOR REFERENCE!! THAT WAS A TAYLOR REFERENCE!!!!!!
Mi vida actual en una canción.
1M en menos de 24 horas, porfavor!!
How relatable and beautiful omg
Wow, this was beautiful
I loved
i’m so proud of how far he’s come ♥️ CONAN YOU’RE AMAZING
Can we get the Superache Is For Virgins shirt please
Conan, somos del mismo dia de cumple!!
Diosmio me encanta esta canción 😭😭
Amo
Wow
This song is checking all the boxes for me : the melody the chords the drums everything. This is the pop rock that I live for
I hear 80's vibes in it and love it. It goes so well with it, you know? It's hard to explain it.
Ow right away from the first 2 seconds of the song I'm like : ow fuck this song is GOOD
Damn it's 9 am a Swiftie thing? Love the song btw the lyrics are so fabulous and music love it ❤️
not me wanting to know the rest of conan and the waiter's story lmao, like what if something happened after?????

🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
YES CONAN THANKYOU
My guy explained who I am in a song.
This is so impactful!! Like Conan never fails to amaze me by the way his songs are so f*cking relatable! There's this best friend of mine who visibly likes me and has tried to confess me many times indirectly but then back off, I can clearly see in this song how disastrously over thinking his mind must be now-a-days lol...
that shirt is so funny to me
te ammooo
Conan graciasss por esto t amooo
Lyrics:   Déjame preparar la escena . Acabo de salir de la fiesta en casa de Blake y es Halloween. Tenía las llaves de mi auto en la mano, pero no me fui . Porque nuestro potencial me mantuvo despierto toda la noche . Me fui. un texto que no leerás en toda la noche  Esto podría ser un desastre Hay tantos factores, como, ¿y si te asustas? Y luego lo estamos perdiendo todo en el capítulo crítico Donde digo "Te amo" y no lo dices después  Esto podría ser un desastre Pedalear hacia atrás, al decir que estoy borracho , realmente no debería No he llamado, estoy un poco enyesado . Me llamas mentiroso, ahora me estoy cayendo.    Oh-oh-oh, desastre  Déjame perder la cabeza ¿Es puramente platónico llamarme, como, todas las noches? Sabes que Ashley cree que hay algo entre tú y yo Pero si lo estoy leyendo mal, hombre, sería mejor que me muera, oh Y si estás leyendo el texto toda la noche  Esto podría ser un desastre Hay tantos factores, como, ¿y si te asustas? Y luego lo estamos perdiendo todo en el capítulo crítico Donde digo "Te amo" y no lo dices después  Esto podría ser un desastre Pedalear hacia atrás, al decir que estoy borracho , realmente no debería No he llamado, estoy un poco enyesado . Me llamas mentiroso, ahora me estoy cayendo.   Oh-oh-oh, desastre Oh-oh-oh, desastre  Tal vez me equivoque (Oh-oh-oh) No eres mía por tomar (Oh-oh-oh) Tal vez me equivoque Tal vez lo acabo de lograr arriba, lo arruiné.
Love u too
Omgggggg i love u
this is my fav thing ever, his best music video
this is amazing conan ahhh i love it and i totally understand, i feel bad for him tho, like I already overthinks things, i wouldn’t be able to trust peoples intentions with love if I was famous

Aaaaaaaa, I just love you Conan! You’re sooo talented and I was blessed to see you perform in Amsterdam a couple of months ago. You’re a true superstar, every singe song of yours is a masterpiece and I’m so excited to watch you grow and evolve into the person you are❤️❤️ thank you for sharing the truth about the world (and the messiness of life) through your songs 💗😘
ilysm
please tell me 'superache is for virgins' is an actual shirt i can buy
The way he says "Lose my mind" with this fake smile GETS ME 😂 Love the concept of the mv and this song is so catchy, he's literally so good at writing songs it's offensive
Ommmggggg in luvvvvv😭🫂🫂
yesss conan, we love the self sabotaging 💅
meu deus q obra de arte
Sun Cafe in Studio City?!!!
Believe in Jesus Christ our Lord, God who became human to save us. Believe he lived a perfect life we can’t, died on the cross for everyone, shed his perfect blood in full payment forever, for all sins and your sins, as a free gift. Then he was buried, then resurrected from the dead 3 days later by Father Gods power, back to eternal life. Giving all who’d believe and trust in him and what he did for us- total forgiveness, a fixed and loving relationship with God, complete salvation from punishment, and eternal life.   Ask him to forgive your sins and save you, and accept his sacrifice for your sins. You will be saved, forgiven, and baptized in the Holy Spirit of God. Then you’re a new creation and Gods adopted child through faith in Jesus Christ, the son of God. When God looks at you, he will see Jesus Christs righteousness, because you believed in his only son. When Gods Holy Spirit lives in you, after you believe, he will also guide you and make you more like Jesus.  You can’t earn heaven or right standing with God, or be good enough on your own. It’s Gods free gift to us by faith, he alone gives forgiveness, new life through Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit to help us. No one can ever boast before God, and everyones equal. God doesn’t owe anybody anything, he wants to give you forgiveness AS A GIFT, out of love for us all.  May God the Father in Heaven bless you through his son, Jesus Christ, amen.
Ok wow
superache is for virgins
This video speaks to my Bi soul
I NEED the “Superache is for Virgins” shirt RIGHT NOW
God, the song is so beautiful 💗
i love you conan superache is amazing
best songs ever seennnnnnnnnnnnn lysmmmmmmmmmmm sweetheart
I think this is song is a masterpice💜
Diz is random bt dont he look like ms. Everything... Loved his voice regardlesd
It was a pleasure having you on our channel 💛💛💛 we’re so proud of you and the album slaps!!! 🔥
Conan is finally getting the attention he really deserves for his talent and work ethic. The inflictions in his voice that he’s able to reach so easily when he’s singing is so impressive to me. I don’t make music in this genre personally, but I know a great singer when I see one and Conan is an excellent singer. It’s super refreshing to me to see actually talented artists get popular. I know I’m not as talented as Conan, but I hope to continue learning and growing as I make more and more music. Bravo Conan! Another great track! 🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼
KING!
the ending is actually so powerful. the fact that he loses out on his chance to be in a relationship because he’s so busy worrying about messing up shows how relationship anxiety can be a self fulfilling prophecy. he manages to make his fears of never being in a good relationship true by stressing so much about it. very interesting and meaningful point!
I love this❣️Conan, you’re amazing~
I love how this album is so catchy but so sad at the same time that’s real talent.
Me encantaas De: Roberto Mtz Para:Conan Gray <3
0:02 how it's emphasized the "he is the problem" THATS SO RELATABLE 💀💀😭😭

Cada canción de Conan es una obra maestra🤍💓🌟🌟
NOT THE GUITAR FIGHT 😭
Does anyone else think the quote from 0:07-0:09 is a reference to that line from Taylor’s song “You Need to Calm Down”? Conan’s definitely a Swiftie, so this has to be intentional 🤩🤩
can i hv at least one Conan Gray's song that is not related to my life :)
Tbh without conan I'd be the most vulnerable person ever when it comes to relationships
ughhhhh u always make BOPPs 111!!!11!!

CONAN IS ALWAYS RELATABLE
I can't be the only one who hates his friend for telling the other guy that he has commitment issues
NUEMERO 15 EN TENDENCIAS!!
"And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life.  And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books. The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works.  Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire." (REVELATION 20:12-15 NKJV)   Today, while you are still alive and able, may you repent from your sins, believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that JESUS CHRIST is your Lord and Savior, so that through Him, your name will be written in the Book of Life.    "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him  should not perish but have everlasting life.  For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved." (JOHN 3:16-17 NKJV)   JESUS LOVES YOU. HE DIED ON THE CROSS SO THAT YOU MAY HAVE LIFE. Please do not ever forget that..

I tend to overthink everything, especially relationships- this song is very relatable and comforting to me!
2:23 LMFAO felt 😂
“Is it purely platonic to call me like every night?”
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates~🟥
Tan hermoso
I have never listened to conana songs, I met this girl I dated her I thoughtshe was in love with me but it seems she never was. I always used to push her. One thing about her is she always hides her feelings and emotions. I understood each of her feelings and emotions. I know she is failing in her exams, having problems with family. I wanted to support her not as a friend but more than that.  I didnt know she was having issues with me(anxious with me). She broke up with me. She wants to be freinds.  I'm feeling guilty. I'm feeling guilty I was the reason she became more anxious.     She is the reason Im following every song of you, after I met her its few songs I liked which are "Maniac", "people watching", "memories", "yours", "Heather" and today when I opened youtube first video came was "disaster". After broke up every songs somehow relates to me.Turning my world upside down. Sometimes I cry sometimes Im happy, im happy thinking about her.
Hilarious, man. Watched it once and fell in love with it all the way. Greetings from Germany .)
R.I.P guitar It played beautifully until the day it was assaulted, needless to say it died happy
O maior do mundo
Why i see name  Allah is there ? or my eyes have something wrong ..

This is literally everything
today is actually my birthday, and this music literally can make my day feel batter ❤
Attraction isn't a choice, but sleeping with someone is a choice.
The waiter is so cute. Does anyone know him?
In the dating game, as soon as we leave, memories slowly fade, and new flirtations arise.
<3
simply every song by Conan is a masterpiece, love it 😍
lindo
My heart suffered more than the guitar
Hey ah... Conan mind dropping the witchy person's number? They seem pretty lit...

THIS SONG IS SO GOOD ps: there is a "o" in the sheish
The overthinking is what gets me and this song encapsulated that
This is giving Checkmate/Telepath
The fact his shirt says “superache is for virgins” 💀
Yaaa pero el hace todo bien 💗💗💗💗💗
sooo good
this could be a disaster .
This song hiiiiiits at 0.75x speed
Ashley must be so proud of you cone, she's in all your songs, your both friendship make me jealous 🥲

My love for him and his music could be a disaster too at this point
0:03 relatable from the very beginning
I want the t shirt
not this video dropping the day i'm considering breaking up with a guy i've only been with for 5 days LMAO
We need more Conan. We are working you down to the bone 💕
What was I saying again?

“SUPERACHE IS FOR VIRGINS” PLSSS😭😭😭😭
who was the guy at the first scene...
I want that superache is for virgins shirt sooo bad 😭😭
¿Confirmamos que Conan NUNCA decepciona?
This song sounds so good and this music video is so funny and amazing, esp the beginning and ending, I can definitely see this song getting stuck in my head all day and randomly bobbing along to it, I love the speed of this song, it makes it so addicting, and “maybe I messed it up” and Conan messing up from getting into a relationship is just, I love it
I miss his talking videos 🥺 but I’m so happy he’s doing so good in the music industry
Conan referring Ashley is the best thing lol
CONAN STOP 🤭😭
THE LEVELS TO THIS SONG
Love it
2:34 مو كأنه كتب اسم الله؟
This is so me🤣😂
the ✨ash and cone✨ reference 🫠
Ashleyyyyy
i love it but i’m on the sad songs team hahaha
Is Conan supposed to be on the date with the daughter or the dad?
conan your lyric writing is so good it feels like those words were made just to be perfectly slotted into the melody lines you write for your songs the rhymes and syllable matching is soooo satisfying another banger sir
I just love Conan man, each song becomes better and better everytime 😩❤️🌼
THIS IS A HIT.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I love u conannaananananananannaannana
YA REPETÍ ESTE VIDEO COMO 10 VECES ES QUE ME ENCANTA
OMG Conan I love you, this song is so beautiful 🛐🛐🛐
CONAN TE AMO
T amo Conan Gray <3
Slay
Conan really has a thing for destroying things
I love how you included Ashley’s name in this song, it’s so cute! I miss your Ash and Cone Cooking Show videos so much, but I listened to this whole album as soon as it was released last night. ❤️❤️
what is written at the window in the min 2:34 ??
LOVE YOU CONAN
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH
ate
Your acting, your singing, your vibe, your aesthetic, your lyrics, your everything is just insane. I love all of it, all the bits and pieces 😭❤️ I'm a huge superache fan now. 💗
Bellísima
De Rythem is the same as “ongewoon” from pomelien Thijs
I think it's the same guy from Heather is his partner in this album
I NEED HIM ILY SM
Hermoso como todo lo que haces mi neni
Please tell me you’re selling the SUPERACHE is for virgins shirt!!
I love u sm conan the Album is so beautiful

AHHHHH! HANDS DOWN CONANS BEST MUSIC VIDEOOOO!!!!
This is amazing as always
lindo conan
he’s so real for this
Such a masterpiece I love you ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The number of Easter eggs about his own album is just insane . Loved the video !!
Es re hermosaaa
Amooooo
MASTERPIECE
This is artt
2:34 did he write الله or I'm being delusional
2:35 lol did conan wrote in the window اللـله in Arabic alphabet which means God
It's the fear which doesn't let us to feel loved or to love. That's ain't shit that's an ISSUE.  The song supposed to make me powerful but all i can do is crying with memories back.
checkmate’s child
Me encantó la canción, realmente es maravillosa, Conan siempre brilla con sus canciones./I loved the song, it really is wonderful, Conan always shines with his songs.
breaking the guitar scene is giving crush culture
Am I the only one who thinks that the waiter is so cutee 😍
literally SO GOOD OH MY GOD
I live for this. I love ALL of Conan’s work. I stayed up and went mid-night swimming just so I could vibe and jam-out to this album. Now it’s the morning of my sister’s birthday, and here we are, listening again. Not only that, but my all-time favorite artist, Regina Spektor, who hasn’t released an album since 2016, came out with an album today as well. Best day ever. 💗
I love you Conan ❤️✨💖
THE SHIRT
AMO TANTÍSIMO ESTE MV, ES QUE ES EL MEJOR. Me encanta jajaja amo su voz, amo el aesthetic, es super gracioso, en fin, legend indeed.
💗💗💗💗💗💗
Conan thank you for this masterpiece I love you
💕💕💕
ídolo
Am I the only one who read his shirt???
Did anyone notice the DSTR shirt he wore in the Memories MV which hinted at this new single? Will we find another hint for his next single in this MV? :P
I'm still in thought that i was watching him because of his vlogs that makes me feel so better a lot of years ago,and now i'm watching him because of his music that made me the better i am right now, He's the greatest person ever!!
Wowwwwwww....amazing....you're a genius boyyyyy....lol...God bless you always 🙏❤️🙏💖🙏❤️
THE “SUPERACHE IS FOR VIRGINS” SHIRT LMAO-
اخخخ احبككك🫂😭🤍🤍🤍
Love love love..❤❤❤
Arte mi rey ✨😘 magnifica rolita 👌✨❤️
CONAN NEVER MISSES
This is a masterpiece <3
IM INLOVE WITH UR MUSIC <3
THIS SONG IS MY FAVORITE RIGHT NOW!!! I LOVE YOU CONAN<3333
OKAY DAMN.
Love you
I feel like he's going from being emocional dependent to being in a emocional block. We are just like our dad
Wish the worrying would go away, but at the same time, when you can have fun without the commitment, it makes it that much harder to really want to put yourself out there.
Oh my GOD😭 Istg everytime I see him I get chills bc he’s just so beautiful❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹 love this, love him. He is the moment, he’s everything
What a wonderful day to be named Ashley :’)
I LOVE GRAY 🥺🤍
2:35 ???? Brooooo! 😂
ARTE
another masterpiece TT
It was so good already one of my favs
❣
The god of music is literally blessing us today
Te amooo papasito me encanta tu musica
OMGGG LOVE THISSSS!!!!!! <3<3<3<3<3
Serious commitment issues 😭
Dude, YES! This, exactly this!
'superach is for virgins' he's so real for that
DUDE
this song is actually me
❤️
22
I gotta say I prefer when he used to sing songs like Crush Culture and Greek God
This song hits me so hard omg I'm so so afraid to get in relationships
TE AMO FILHOOOOOOOOOOOOO
A brilliant try on the amazing unique vocal Conan you have I like how like little hurry the whole song is, to curious and worry about next. The “Di—saster~” sound great Just I little too repetitive, what if same verse in music but little change on lyrics like few of those Taylor songs?  I think Conan is a huge fans of her. Also! The intro and outro is funny haha
كونان كتب( الله ) على جامت السيارة لو اني انحولت🌚🌚
OOOOOMMMMGGGGGG I LOOOOOOOVE ITTTTTTTTTTTTT
conan tries dating
ilysm youve come so far since sunset season oml this is a masterpiece
Godddddddddddddddd
Really a good song 🤩 I’m becoming a fan with this album ❤️‍🔥
هوس جديد لاسبوع قدام 😓
why I can relate to all of his songs 😭😭???
This song really slaps! Amazing Conan I´m gonna go to listen Superache now
IM SO PROUD OFF U
I'm pretty sure the guy with the guitar was playing Wonderwall 🥲🥴🥴 HAHAHAHA
omg this was so good on so many levels. im hooked
conan’s music>>>>>
OMG ashley’s mentioned in this song HAHAHA
"Ok damn, its 9AM" "Damn, its 7AM" well done conan paying tribute to mother
Listening to this on repeat. Conan your music fails to amaze me.
conan gray acting era lets go (also nice song)
Teamo Miriam 💗😿
BSIHDIDGOSHDISYKDBSIHDOGSJDHSOJDKSJFKNSLFNPANFKSNLF ITS SO GOOD IM CRYING SHITTING TEARS
There's Ashley's name omg their friendship is so pure i love them!!!!
getting ready to cry for the whole album🫶🏻

🤍
I'm convinced you have some kind of doorway to my mind
He is 🏳️‍🌈?
Conan siempre sorprendiéndonos ♥️🤗
شفته كتب الله ع الروشن ولا اني نتخايل
another masterpiece 🤌🏻❤️‍🔥🌹
💗💗💗💗🧎🏻‍♀️

This album really shows how much he has matured since sunset season. Love love love 💕💕

위대한 음악은 위대한 예술가 없이 이루어질 수 없다.
this is what we called the aesthetic masterpiece.
I love you very much
ily
Another masterpiece.. I love it. I love you.
SOOO GOOOOOOD
SIEMPRE ME IDENTIFICO CON TODAS  TUS CANCIONES CONAN, estuvo genial AAA♡
this album!
Every conan album/song is the start of a new mental crisis for me…..
How does this man know exactly what I am going through,,,,,, EVERYTIME???
THE FACT THAT HE'S WEARING A T SHIRT THAT SAYS SUPERACHE IS FOR VIRGINGS HITS HARDER
yes.
Cruel summer + good 4 u vibesssssss
Been listening to him since “the other side” and its safe to say that i am completely emotionally and mentally unstableY-Y
Ok this album i cant -
Mais uma obra PERFEITA😍😍 Conan nunca erra🤯🤯😍
Not the superache is for virgins shirt!!!
I love this song, honestly I think you should make more like this! 💕
'u know ashley believes that theres something between u & i' lmaaooo
Conan is the representative to the singles out there who nag about being single but it's us ourselves who is at fault for being single
OK but why is this man so freakishly gorgeous? Like I can't focus on the song sometimes cos I'm so captivated by his visuals. Conan is honestly one of the most beautiful people on the planet!
حلووووة
this song is a freakn masterpiece this makes me laugh & cry at the same time
Omg anti romantic af. i love this !!!
This is a masterpiece
عاااش
Couldn't decide if I wanted to hear this or Taylor swifts new song
God damnit. This is me . And me is this. 🙊
Wow u wrote the word Allah on the window
The "superache is for virgins" shirt needs to be merch
NO ONE'S GONNA TALK ABOUT HIS RED T-SHIRT OR WHAT, IM OFFENDED >:(
the "god i hate couples" opening of this mv lmaooo00
Ahh! My day was a disaster today and maybe Monday would be a disaster too but this is the only disaster i will enjoy!
So proud of u Conan!!
OMG soo good 💥
te amo conan, tu música es mi lugar seguro
Oh god I can't say how much I've been loving him I wish he always keep himself and his work just tge way they sre
AAA I LOVE IT
the red shirt... thank you for that conan
why is conan always so relatable
Amoooo
De México
Soy tu fan
TE AMOOOOOO
Beautiful disaster 😍
Damn those serious commitment issues!!
U GUYS DO NOT UNDERSTAND!! I HAVE TO KNOW WHAT HE HAD WRITTEN ON THE GLASS 2:35 because if in any case he wrote the word "الله" and wiped it it would mean a very very bad thing for me and for Muslim  If you know tell me
The fact that Ashley got a mention!!!!!!! 💞💞
Conan never disappoints
what he wrote ?
conan please sell the superache is for virgins shirt i need to own that
Conan gray never disappoints, this song is too good for my ears, so incredible🙊
OK at which point did Conan's songs go from "fun teenage pop to sing along to" to "personal disstrack aiming directly at like every single aspect of my life struggles"
ILYSMMM
i love the mv so much commitment issues and fearing of how the relationship is gonna end rlly hurts and messes everything upppp
ohmgod wow 😭whole album is on another level i’m literally cryingggggg
This is just tooo good from the lyrics to the mv to everything is just perfect! I love it!! Damn love you conan gray
OMG ITS SOOO GOODDDD
🔥❤️
I started watching Conan his youtube videos in 2017 so I automatically also started listening to his music and this music video might be my favourite one so far, I love it sm the concept and everything is just so cool!!!
Omg Conan you did this!!!
GUYS THIS ALBUM IS AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE. All of those songs are absolutely beautiful, and let's face it, heartbreaking. Some even hit close to home. Conan has this capacity to make you relate to things that never happened to you (just like Taylor Swift!! they're both my favorite singers for a reason). I've never been in a relationship or anything like that, but I still scream each lyric of Superache  from the top of my lungs. I'm so proud of Conan and of what he has accomplished, because he's letting himself being even more vulnerable in this new album and this is really REALLY brave of him. He deserves the world!!🌹❤‍🩹
i know when i heard maniac for the first time.. he's gonna be star i literally listen to him everyday he is so fricking talented i love you conan
Superache is for virgins? I NEED THAT SHIRT
THE SHIRT
LOVR THIS
"superache is for virgins"
I love this song so much
This could b a disaster?!!  I can proudly say that This song isn't a disaster 😅
SUPERACHE IS FOR VIRGINS
THIS SONG>>>>>>>>> INFACT SUPERACHE OVER ALL>>>>>>>
Impressão minha ou ele foi num date com a Dona Florinda ?!
We can vibe in this song easily!!!
Also the verse „Ashley believes” is killing me, i long for a friendship like yours, she really is your fucking best friend
💞💗💞💗💗💞💞💞💗💗💞💗💗
so proud of you
i love youuuuu soooooo muchhhhh
Ahhhh i hate myselfffff.. i was "six hours" laaateeee to hear this amazing sooong!!!!😭😭 I've never even been a sec late!! But I love myself .. for I did landed up in conan's music! Love u Conan❤️💗
Superache really is a super ache, cant believe im gonna fly across the globe to see you perform soon
lmao the shirt « superache is for virgins »
Wait a minute, did he write Allah in Arabic or I'm hallucinating-
The tshirt skaldhhdjsksdb im dead

2:35 I HAVE TO KNOW WHAT DID HE WRITE IN THERE?????
the shout out to Ashley ahhhhhhhhhhhhh so good
ANOTHER BOP!!

I love the dramatic vibe of Conan's music. It's never overdone, it's perfectly encapsulating of the situation. Such a clever writer.
이번 노래 진짜 미친거같아..개좋다

I am not crying you are ;-;
this album is absolutely beautiful, i think this song gives off wish you were sober + telepath vibes. also notice how his shirt says "superache is for virgins" we know cone T^T

2:35 what is that?? What did he write on the glass??
we all afraid to enter a relationship bcoz we all have issues 🤣🤣
This song describe my love life , thank u Conan❤

https://youtu.be/iGSWNS8OHRE
Let me just, set the scene I’d just left the party at Blake’s And it’s Halloween Had the keys to my car in my hand  But I didn’t leave  Cuz the potential of us It was keeping me up All night long I left a text you won’t read  All night long  This could be a disaster  There’s so many factors  Like what if you freak out  And then we’re losing it all  At the critical chapter  Where I say “I love you” And you don’t say it after?   This could be a disaster  I’m pedaling backwards  By saying that “I’m drunk, I really shouldn't have called”  I’m a little bit plastered You call me a liar, Now I’m falling in faster This could be a disaster  Ooh, Disaster Ooh, Disaster  Let me just, lose my mind Is it purely platonic To call me like every night? You know, Ashley believes That there’s something between you and I But if I’m reading it wrong then it’d be better off if I died  And if you’re reading the text all night long  This could be a disaster There’s so many factors Like what if you freak out And then we’re losing it all At the critical chapter Where I say “I love you” And you don’t say it after?  This could be a disaster I’m pedaling backwards By saying that “I’m drunk I really shouldn't have called I’m a little bit plastered”  You call me a liar, Now I’m falling in faster This could be a disaster  Ooh, Disaster Ooh, Disaster  Maybe I’m mistaken You’re not mine for taking Maybe I’m mistaken Maybe I just made it up,  Messed it up
بوقتها👎🏻
as always conan songs are very relatable
بصيح اخيراا💥💥💥🫶🏻

I wasn't expecting something like that but it's just wonderful 😍
I'M OBSESSED
Sometimes we just think too much 🥺
Every son he releases I relate to so much
And again he represents all of humanity's fears about falling in love. How could be this man knowing our feeling well ...

Conan you and you're songs are amazing, i wish i could tell it to yourself not you're YouTube videos .😭😂♥️
idk if the one with the girl at the dinner thing was her dad but i will tell you this has happened to me before my now girlfriends dad showed up at our date 😂
i love actor conan yeee

çok gururluyum of
That scene in the car has awakened my claustrophobia and I'm suddenly unable to breathe... the song was good tho
This is so Good! :))
Conan will never forget to make me completely relate to his songs and m/vs  and the ending?!?! he lost his chance because he was busy overthinking how it would go that he never actually got to know. Aish, so powerful and relatable. Conan, you can never make a bad song
Commitment issue. That's me ! 💆
Literally could relate to most of his song. Another great song ❤️
This music video is CAMP
💗💗💗
Omg this  something we should talk about ❤️
Ah perfect song for the overthinker! As always, I love your music <3
NEVER REALLY DATED ANYONE BECAUSE OF THIS
not his shirt saying "superache is for virgins" 😭
All of your songs are just  MASTERPIECES!!!
I can relateeee
Its giving bop and couple issues

My heart broke after you hit the guitar on the ground 😭
Did anyone see what was written on the shirt 💀
Şaşırmadık yine MÜKEMMEL

"ok damn ,its nine AM damn its  seven AM

CONAN I LOVE YOU
the superache is for virgins shirt i need
" He has serious commitment issues" * Cackles in Sagittarius *
love it Conan!!! 💗💗💗
I love how Conan gray is such a refreshing artist because his lyrics relate to modern day. I can imagine frantically texting friends at 1 am because I said something bold, it’s just so relatable and the melody is so fun. His music is addictive
This man is the definition of bisexual
i've been a fan since 2020 and conan has never disappointed. his music is always amazing. so glad i got to meet him one month ago
OMG THIS IS GONNA BE AMAZING
Conan I literally love you
the "superache is for virgins" shirt 😭
The best song ever comes out right on my birthday lol
Oh My Conan.
That chorus is so catchy, love you Conan! 🕺🕺🕺🕺
I'm screaming,conan SLAYED as usual
Conan really just decided to attack me for an entire album and everything is fine :))))
This song is just killinnggg meeeeeeee
I LOVE THIS
THIS IS A MASTERPIECE
omg
gonna start dancing to this even tho the lyrics are painfully true (applies to me)
d
You deserve the world.
🛐
AMAZING AS ALWAYS.  SO MUCH LOVE CONANNNNN💗
No bc I was like yea i relate to the scenarios and then the ending came.. 💀 I feel so attacked 👁️👄👁️
and that's a so conan gray song and mv 😭
OH MY GOD NOW THIS. THIS IS GREAT😭😭😭😭😭
Nice man...👌
Woke up to this  DAY MADE 🤧👍🏿💕
been waiting for this music video and it was everything i hoped for and more😤😮‍💨
Again i found him cute, how he getting scared and uncertain to have a relationship. I mean everyone is like that, and Conan just say it louder for us🤟🏻
Mahni cox mukemmeldir
omg je t’aime merci
I heard olivia Rodrigo vocals here,idk
"Superache is for virgins" I love this shirt!
wait im kinda in love with the witch girl and the plushie girl...
At very first, with trailer I was super excited because I taught that I would be able to see different side of Conan, this time with just a guy. But, after watching the MV I was actually not that happy. Don't worry my love for you and your music don't change at all 💗.
conan's back to his crush culture destroying romance era
I love that kind of vibe ! His voice is so addictive!!!!!
It's so FREAKING  GOOD!!!!
Every music he released the only thing that I'm saying the whole time through out the video is "It's so good " like what am i even expecting duhh of course it is its conan
I loved the song, your voice is always beautiful, I love you so much
overdrive and this are so aaa deserve a grammy
In love with Conan This is PERFECT ILY CONANNNNNNNN
Once again Conan makes an amazing song with a amazing video....he never fails to impress
🤍🤍🥰🥰🥰😩😩😩❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🙉🤍🤍
🙉🙉🙉🥰🙉🤍🙉🙉🥴
❤️‍🔥🥰🙉🤍🥴🥴🥴🥴🤍🤍🤍❤️❤️❤️😩😩🥰🥰🥰🙉❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🥰🙉🙉
The line about ash made me so happy
This disaster could be a super-hit masterpiece for sure. I love how he took the name of Ashley in the song. Ashley is so lucky that she's a down-to-earth friend even though he's at the top of the mountain right now. Love Conan forever.
I'M OBSESSED W/ THIS SONGGGG 😩😩😩
i’m so proud of you cone 🥹🫶🏼🌹
love it, love this, love you
i love love love this song (really needed it last year tho shhxcn)
2:34 not me thinking he write alif lam lam ah there tho  but seriously what he write there tho
UR HAIR LOOKS SO GOOOD CONAN
Ahhhh!! It was a disaster , coz it’s pretty clear now , that person is not really a blessing that much but a lesson . Soo yeahhhh  needs to recharge for how long without crushing on anyone and like pout and continue to be bitter 🤣lol
how convenient for you to put out this song right when I start dating again, like I wasn't already freaking out on the matter....
Been a stan for years. His music makes me feel so confident and seen. Love you Cone ❤️✌🏿✨
the ashley part tho
This song just explained why my relationships dont work...it gets awkward asf real fast lmao
Ahhh he mentioned Ashley 😭😩💕💕
Conan Gray always releases songs when I get rejected or dumped or ghosted this is no longer a coincidence
Facts: I need this crocheted hat and sweater, it’s so cuteee😍😍
Aw he’s cutee
I love you and your music conan❤️🧎‍♀️
getting emotional bc he’s grown so much since sunset season. love you conan can’t wait to see what the future holds for you! also this music vid is hilarious and i love it ❤️

WHAT DOES THE “allah”الله" PART MEAN
ANYONE ELSE NOTICE THE SUPERACHE POSTER ON THE GIRLS WALL💀
POV:you are in love with Conan Gray✨
Fuck the car scene gave me claustrophobia
I hate Conan bec u don't have to call me out like this😭
Conan is just great
He is text"الله"????
finally an anthem about falling in love with straight boys! what a time to be alive
My first comeback with Conan. I lovw him so much
Conan: *singing while smashing the guitar* Guitar: what did I do? WHAT DID I DOO!!
Another song from Conan which will be used by me to dramatically lip sync in the bathroom GREAT!!!
Loveee itttt
THIS IS SO GOOD OMG. Conan releasing masterpieces as always
Conan what da fuckk
Conan Gray IS HIM
Is it just me or his face expressions kinda remind to olivia rodrigo
conan absolutely slayed in that black outfit
so good 🔥
Liked it. ❤️🇧🇷👌💫👏
" GOD, I HATE COUPLES " " YOU'RE JUST MAD YOU'RE CLINICALLY SINGLE " YEAH DEFINITELY ME HAHAHA.
im sorry but i laughed so hard at conan stomping that poor man's guitar 😭
Aahh.. Woowew😭
The shirt 😭
the mv is soo cool!!! lovely
This boy is angelic <3
THIS ALBUM IS AMAZING, THANK YOU CONAN :)
❤️
Music and painting both are Art... Just like painting, some music has open ends which let people interpret the story. I think Conan's music is like an abstract painting. Indeed a masterpiece.🤍🫂
For every single guy out there it gets better..
what a mood ???!!! love you conan
Today, I asked for clarity from a person, whom I thought I had a thing going on, only to get crushed into a million more pieces.  Conan's album couldn't have come at a better time 💗🙏.
I hate when relationships end before they even had a chance to start :(
Sorry but this one made me laugh 😭
Is it just me or anybody else feel Conan is giving off  Taylor Swift vibes in the video ?? 🥰
OMG I LOVE U ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️
Another grear new video ✨the vibe is amazing
❤️❤️❤️❤️🫶🏻
should be on the top 40 soon w Ryan ;)
I have serious Commitment problems two also is the shirt going to be merch? Cuz I love it
AHH THIS IS AMAZING ,, i am truly so lucky to be born at a time where conan is releasing music😌   and the ending PLS LITERALLY ME
❤️❤️❤️
i just noticed that his shirt says “superache is for virgins” and i’m dying
🔥
Uno de los mejores trabajos de conan💞💞💞
this is the maniac of superache
OH MY GOD
this is slay
I hope you can come to a better place, I will always support
THE SUPERACHE SHIRT CONAN IM CRYING
Conan's facial expressions prove he's Olivia's brother
our conan ate and evoured everything AGAIN !!
i love how all the songs in the ablum tie together to get a deeper understanding of conan. in family line he talks about how because of his dads abuse he would enver be able to trust anyone truly, and it shows when in the ending of this song he talks about being mistaken and that he made it up which was actually him overthinking because of his past truamas.
THE SONG IS EVERYTHING
OMG
CONAN ILY
Love u Conan ❤️‍🩹
Damn...it's 9 am
Conan mi ídolo, adoro tu canción!
Mindblowing album
at first it was just heather, now my playlist is filled of conan gray
happy pride y’all
i love this music
Trash💀
Conan Gray What The Hell?? 😭😭👀
I AM SORRY BUT 'SUPERACHE IS FOR VIRGINS' GOT ME SO BAD LSDDJDLF 😂
I think Disaster is the best song of this album besides Astronomy~
"Is it purely platonic to call me like, every night?" made me realize something about my own situation 😃
yes ik, I'm single :D
this honestly made my day and the entire album just blew my mind & was so relatable, especially family line, movies, & summer child like... WOW ❤ i cannot wait to see u on tour i love you and this journey of how far you've gone is so incredible
0:50 i can't believe Conan Gray invented palm muting
Does anyone else feel attacked?😭😭 I felt this song with my whole heart😩💔
Superache is for virgins.
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Again Conan hitting us right at the spot where it hits. Can relate so much since i too have commitment issues and thus end up being single asf even though i have been asked out like thrice this year
"its 9am, it's supposed to be a safe space, it's BRUNCH"
THE ALBUM IS AMAZING ILYYY
<3
I LOVE U
THIS IS PERFECTION ILYSM
Ay mükemmel mükemmel
I think im the only one here who didnt become a conan fan for heather😭😭
"Damn. it's 9 am"
yes conan
T amo conan 🥳

I'm in luv
"Is it purely platonic to call me like every night?" ouch. thank you conan for spoiling us- album release, tickets go on sale, & this masterpiece of a MV.

here before it hits the chart<33
TE AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO CONAN AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHFGJHGUKKNJ
I PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY CANNOT JANDLE TJIS RN
I love u conan
Heather introduced me to Conan Gray, and I didn't think I'd get more of his songs even though I had Heather in my playlist, until I heard People Watching. I instantly fell in love with the song and I downloaded as many of Conan's songs as long as I liked them (and that was pretty much all of them). This made me find songs like affluenza, Greek god, checkmate, the cut that always bleeds and a lot of others. The long and short of it, I LOVE YOUR MUSIC AND I'M NOW A MAJOR FAN.  Edit: Wow, I didn't expect this would get so many likes. I just commented and forgot about it.
THIS IS SO FUN
If your free this week lemme know 😉
The superache is for virgin shirt😭😭😭😭
Wait?? Did anyone notice what he wrote on the window on 2:33 I’m arab and if I’m not mistaken it’s الله Which is allah as in what muslims call god i really love conan since day one But this just ruined it all and i don’t know what’s the point of this clip and how writing allah is related but i really do find it offensive since it wasn’t a first in the western music industry about putting islamic religious words symbols and in many ways although on conan i really do hope i got it all wrong
THIS IS SO GOOD! HOLY CRAP ❤
wake up babes, conan just dropped another bop
WOW I LOVE IT
SLAPS
this video is a masterpiece i swear
not his friend roasting him at the end of the video lmao
I love this song and this album was amazing!
Crush Culture music video: conan wrecking other people's dates Disaster music video: conan wrecking his own dates

SLAY CONAN

"Superache is for virgins" so funny
:)
here
AN ICON, A LEGEND, AND HE IS THE MOMENT! NOW COME ON NOW?!
I love this ✨
this is a masterpiece and and have waited so long for this
Masterpiece
this album is so beautiful. he always writes the most amazing songs full of heartbreak & emotion. this song reminds me of telepath- emotional & yet still a bop
YASS
Conan!!! Luvvv
Lol the end is literally me doing anything😂
I just need to see conan scream this song in my face then I can die
Conan sponsoring his own albums be like:lets put it all in the wall  But whatever this was lit
Pinche canción hermosa
just watched his performance on fallon omg so good
Another Masterpiece
Temazo
AMOO ❤
The only *disaster* is your under appreciated. 😫🤘
Fuck me bt this is a masterpiece!
AHHHH ESTO ES HERMOSOOO
Conan siendo siempre tan perfecto
Perfect💛
the ending is actually so powerful. the fact that he loses out on his chance to be in a relationship because he’s so busy worrying about messing up shows how relationship anxiety can be a self fulfilling prophecy. he manages to make his fears of never being in a good relationship true by stressing so much about it. very interesting and meaningful point!  edit: y’all- i could start an army with the amount of people who liked this, who wants to join ??
Mi canción más personal
Pinche cancion espectacular 😭💗
I LOVE, YOU'RE AMAZING BABY ❤🥺
ok but the merch—?
This song needs to be in a coming of age movie asap!!
Another masterpiece!!!😌☁️♥️
No están en Spotify!???
SOBBING
