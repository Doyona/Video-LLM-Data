Seriously who would watch this
It’s funny that Rogan is so woke then does this lol
I am watching the series now and if it went down like they say that Tommy hires people and never pays them for their work and is always put in a gun to their head and harassing them and Pamela is an airhead in the movie and blames a construction workers for something they never did then it is a beautiful thing that a video was stolen who cares They are such a irresponsible couple according to how this series is going down..... If this is how Tommy really is he is the worst of the worst and deserves far worse than having some dumb video out there
Is it possible to stream this in Europe?
Quiero ver esa película
Seth Rogan character was such a simp
Perfect spin off to THE DIRT movie haha 🤘
Glad that she got away from him. He's toxic. Yet I hope her son's haven't been exposed to this,,,,yet.
What's the name of the song in the background?
Guitarist Buckethead should replace Sebastian Stan for the role of Tommy Lee. Besides Machine Gun Kelly looked exactly like the young Buckethead unmasked when he played Tommy Lee in The Dirt! 🎭🎨🥁🎸
I felt so so bad, especially for Pamela. She was SO hurt by this STOLEN tape that was so personal and private, I believe it destroyed her inside and out. I never watched the Video by Vivid it felt like I would have been watching a couple SO in love with each other, he really wasn’t helpful but he supported her until Vegas, I would have left too! I watched it on Hulu and it really is a good show. Although since it was stolen I believe it ruined their own peace of mind. She really didn’t deserve nor did Tommy, any that happened. Truly sad 😢 I would employ that you don’t watch the Video now in 2022 because it’s disgusting that their love and lives were torn apart. I wouldn’t take anymore of their dignity!! Plain and Simple
The gal who plays Pamela is 10 times hotter/beautiful than “Pamela”…just sayin’…
Watched the show, and it was better than I can ever expect. Was a little bit concerned reading comments about how this show didn't get Pamela's consent and should not be made. But I didn't even know who Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee are in real life, I got curious about why is this event worth any attention after so many years. I watched the show, and because the show is doing a good job painting the whole picture, I think I get it.   Pam didn't have any legal right to stop the tape from spreading, and if it happened now, she would definitely have the legal right to stop it. It really is important to understand that the society, especially the legal system that failed Pam, has somehow improved itself a bit.   Also, I think what hurt Pam the most wasn't people talking about it, but how senseless people talking about it in a humiliating way. I can only imagine how devastating it was to feel like the whole world is mocking at you. The way to some how compensating terrible trauma happened in the past is definitely not to never talk about it again, but to talk about it in a understanding and supportive manner. I think this show at least is spreading awareness, to make its audience being empathetic toward Pam. Only if there were more media voicing like what this show is about, the event could be less devastating.
What show
I dived in without knowing anything about the plot. As someone who lived through the 90s and considers Pamela Anderson as the last iconic Femme fatale I loved this show.
Give them all the awards!! I swear if they are snubbed
I wish Danny Doom was on Hulu!
I love you too baby girl ❤️❤️😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
She would make a great Harley Quinn!!!
Ironic that another video is being released without their consent.
she doesn't look even close to Pamela....
I don't know who's luckier, Seb or Lily. My bisexual hormone is tingling. 🤣
Heartbreaking that they made a whole show about Pamela's consent violation without getting her consent. Thousands of people are gonna look up that tape because of this show, putting her through this all over again.
Too bad 90% of this never happened. According to who? According to Motley Crue.
The "feminist message" of this show is that it is cool to profit from exploiting victims of trauma. They didn't get Pamela Anderson's approval to do this show, and they are not giving her a dime for doing this and they are re-traumatizing her. This all-male production crew has basically employed the same business model as the villains they portray. They are all profiting from a woman's trauma without her consent, it's her story and she makes zero from it. Then they go around telling people they are feminists. The hypocrisy and shamelessness here is utterly ridiculous. Not surprised at all that the Franco's are involved. Sure, they make Pamela a sympathetic character, that's completely performative activism, because none of the benefit of this goes to Pamela Anderson the person and victim. To say you care about the victim while going ahead on this project without her consent, exploiting her past pain, and then profiting from it is just a self-serving, bald-faced lie. This series is basically a window into the pathology of America, where people pretend to be doing good things while they are just exploiting other people's pain for profit. Absolutely grotesque.
Nothing in my life has ever made me feel as guilty as watching that tape.
She looks just like Pam. Great choice
All planned and now it's on Disney wtfu
The show is just one song playing loud after another for every episode. It’s more like TRL than a TV show.
Actress who played Cinderella and Natasha Rostova... Lily James transformation is incredible, she deserves Emmy nomination for this
Reminds me a lot of I, Tonya. The director is amazing
An excellent series
Seeing Lily James in this Pam Anderson role makes me wonder why they just didn't get Margot Robbie for it.
Should’ve used the actors from The Dirt. No offense but the actors for Pam & Tommy look like cheap knock offs. MGK is the best Tommy Lee that isn’t even Tommy Lee.
need machine gun kelly to play tommy
Does anyone Know the name  of the song That plays in this trailer?
Looks like it might actually be good. To bad I won't watch it because I will never watch a movie with Seth Rogan again.
🧐Tommy Lee & Pam Anderson were hotter than these actors. Truth, is sexy than fiction. I bet the Carpenter was better looking too.
Why is this available on Disney+ ??
Alguien sabe el título de la canción del segundo 0:38 por favor gracias
Does anyone know the title of the song of the second 0:38 please thanks
💓Meatloaf
I started watching this today and I have to say this show is awesome 😎😎
Don't watch this trash, it's exploitive af as made without Pamela's consent.
0:18 big thanks for using real hi8 camcorders in an industry where most people resort to using cheap effects.
"distributions from a coverdell education savings account (esa) or section 529 plan are tax-free. this is true as long as you use the distributions to pay qualified education expenses" 😅
Felt bad for what happened to Pamela and Tommy but the way the staff was treated was horrible. Nobody deserves this.  The judge and all who did her dirty may GOD deal with them as he sees fit.  It is a stolen video.  A persons rights were violated.  I am grateful to GOD I never did a video.  How can they allow a stolen video that is personal property be seen.  This is insane.  GOD gave her beautiful children and I am sure she wants to bury this but seeing this movie has made me see her in a different light.  At first i said oh rich people problem but this is just so jacked up.,  I am sorry to her and her children.
A total cringe fest.
Didnt care about the real pam and tommy...i could care less about this show
more trash and rubbish from Hollywood
So now it's Richard Madden's twin brother with Lily James? Can't wait to see what this is going to be like
Sooo dumb. People that enjoy mediocre TV will love this sh*t.  Also they should have gotten someone tall to play Tommy Lee like mgk did in The Dirt. He made sense.  Pamela was a goddess. This actress doesn't look like her.  Just eh. I couldn't get through the episodes.
This is a horrible Tommy impression. This dude looks like Chris Kattan and is just as short. The real Tommy is 6'.3 and towers over the 5'.5 Pam.
They could of casted a better Pamela. This actress is to skinny. Pamela was voluptuous in the most perfect way.
This was made against Pamela Anderson's wishes. They are making money off her trauma disregarding the fact that she didn't want this series made. It's exploitative. Also they show Pam and Tommy's relationship as a great love story when in reality Pamela was assaulted and abused by Tommy. The trailer looks great but I can't watch this with a good conscience.
Glad you show Seth almost as his actual self, a useless idiot deviant that pisses his pants at the first sign of conflict. The only thing you got wrong was making him the underdog. You'll never have me convinced he is anything but a scumbag. His words and actions made me realize what a vile person he is and I'll never see him as anything else.
They should have named the series "This Was All Tommy's Fault", it would have been an accurate title.
Lily James looks completely h unrecognisable in this Wow
GOD, I love Lily James!
What's the first song, I'm from Spain and I can't recognize it
My brain simply cannot accept that that is Lily 🤯
Pam had more than one tape. Another was leaked in 2005 with Bret Michael's.  So if Pam gets this treatment. What about...  Colin Farrel Kim Paris Sylvester Stalone The celeb list goes on with many more seasons.  Maybe an Amy Fisher or are we done with this scandal? Rather do shows on the people that wronged others. There are loads of good stories to be told.
She is really sweeeeet I like her!!!!!
Kickstart my heart.
What happened? Looks like nothing on Hulu?
Featuring Meatloaf, right after his death ...how apropos
This show has the most mismatched soundtrack of all time... Decent delivery of the story but horrible music 🤮
No one could ever do Pamela Anderson justice! She was everything!
Good love ❤️
Nice .
She looks like Pam. Stan just looks like an actor playing Tommy... Not impressed
Why even make a movie about them when Tommy and Pamela weren't even involved in the making of this movie..I hope they sue because I would if someone made a movie about me without my consent and so many inconsistencies about my life..Only Pamela and Tommy know exactly what happened in their relationship
Everyone is talking about how Lily looks like Pam but she got the voice down too!
Loving the show!!!!
Are there any actual humans in this comments section, or is it only bots? Good lord
I can't wait!
The guy who hated this and gave a bad review, must not like one of the world's greatest hair metal bands and sexy people, things that make you go....hmmm!
Lily James is an excellent actress! Talk about range!
Just when you think, Lily James, couldn't get any hotter, this comes out.
Oh yes!
Here for the makeup artist(s) and costume crew who flat out nailed it.
Whats the name of the song from second 0:11?
Pam and Tommy are my parents names.
What is the title of this song?
This dude has made a career with ONE hit Pineapple express  Amazing Star of freaks and geeks haaa, The interview haaa, knocked up, Barbara Streisand movie, sausage party wow smoking retail items, green fn hornet, Zack and MIRI...... Dude how does he have a career with one hit
AGGGGGGGGGGhhh IM SO EXCITEDDDDDDDDDDDD
I am just amazed, how can that be Lily James.. i don't understand, there is just no way they can transform someone so much. it's so crazy to me that i'm struggling to accept it
Am I gonna be able to watch this with regular hulu (disney bundle) or do I need the live tv version or something?
The one that plays Pamela is too skinny and small.
Pamela says this movie is bringing back painful memories she tried so hard to forget in the last 20 years.
The fact that Nick Offerman and Seth Rogen haven’t been a duo before is criminal
Cringe
The irony of a series about intrusion and lack of consent is itself made entirely without the consent of Pamela or Tommy… there really need to be rules and laws about using the lives/stories of living people like this.
can we talk abt lily james’s transformation as pamala?? so cool!
I've Always Liked Pamela Anderson Lee  & Loved Tommy Lee. I'm sure it's going to Be a Wide range of everything. But it's all about that $$Cash $$  @TommyLee. & @PamelaAndersonLee What Do You two think of them making that Show about you guys .😬🤐🤔🤔  I Love the Both of you guys
And they had to pick a Meat Loaf song...
WOW, getting lit! 🔥
this gotta be the dumbest thing to watch
You know you are getting old when you see a trailer of a movie during a time you lived through, portrayed by a couple of actors that you don't know. I will say for the little amount of time they do act like the central characters very well.
They didn't have to make a clone of Pamela Anderson to star in the movie but they did it anyway. Going the extra mile.
The fact that both Sebastian Stan and Machine Gun Kelly have both played Tommy
The rare time when the movie is better than the book.
Is this airing on Disney+ like I’ve heard? If so, why? Isn’t that like a streaming platform for children/teen type things (not adult content)?
I like how Seth Rogen actually sounds different
Pamela got a hot body but I never find her very attractive, Lily on the other hand I found very pretty but too skinny for my liking, when I saw this I was like, D*mn they just created the most perfect person. Hot, beautiful and VERY talented.
So dumb
really running out of ideas for movies, aren't they?
This is for people who had not been born in the time of Baywatch.
Amazing transformation by Lily James. I never thought someone like her would resemble Pam. The nose could be a little improved though. I loved Sebastian' Stan's transformation as well.
I can't tell by this trailer but I hope they didn't make Pamela's character dumb. Pamela's actually very smart.
Okay so apparently the YT algorithm picks up on certain words and deletes the comment. Even when it's not offensive (Man that algorithm is weird!)  Anyway, looks very interesting and I'll totally watch this on Hulu.
I'm here for Lily and Seb omg🤩♥️
Ron fcking Swanson with Bucky. Sold.
raise your hand if you're here for sebastian stan *raises hand*
The song choice seems ridiculous AND perfect at the same time
what has our world become
i’ll watch this show because of sebastian. just to be clear :)
Mötley Crüe TV Pack  The Dirt on Netflix Pam & Tommy on Hulu
Love Pam so much. Think she’s a beautiful person inside and out. Doting mother, lover, and protector of animals and their rights. Pam is a sweetheart and I’ll always be a fan ❤️
Sebastian Stan 😍😍😍😍😍
I always knew Pamela Anderson would do a perfect Cinderella role back in the days
Looks dreadful. I don't think Lily James sounds or acts like Pamela Anderson at all.
I think this is such a breakthrough for both lily and sebastian. Its very new character for them.. and it looks like they are killing it!
Seb? Emo? I'm comin baby
I’m here for Sebastian Stan 😍😍😍😍😍
Do people even care about these two people to make a whole movie about them?
Ohhh yeah
Eww I can’t stand that white girl voice.That voice is so annoying !!!! They’re all annoying
I'm sorry, Lily James is pretty hot to begin with, but when she's done up like that she becomes MEGAHOT!
Wow!
If it's half as amazing as I, Tonya, it will be the best thing on TV.
LILY f**cking JAMES!!! 🔥🤯👏
I’m very excited to see this! Loved I Tonya! So I’m very excited to see the director shine a spotlight on Pam and Tommy’s relationship.
Sebastian Stan man you looking good
Sebastian’s voice 😍
Unfortunately, I do not recall it being "the greatest love story ever sold." I do not even recall it having a Princess Grace-Prince Rainer-like publicity. She still acted like she was single during that sham relationship and was still too much into Playboy and having roles with revealing outfits. It also did not generate the same amount of interest, at least from my recollection, as per se Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise.
*Seb as Tommy Lee is GIVING ME LIFE —* 🥵
I never though Lily could be this beautiful and sexy!  She needs to stick to this look!!
I am here for Sebastain too❤️❤️ i fell in love with him🥰 can't get  him out  of the head🥺😊😘
Oh God... I miss the Winter soldier 🙄
Regardless of what's real and exaggerated, this just reads like a knockoff Boogie Nights.
This is the most inspiring Trailer I've ever seen, very original.
now i’ll wait for a film about vince neil and sharise ruddell bye
Kim K ain't watching this eh
Who sings the first  song
If this doesn’t include the borat arc, then I’m not watching it.
omg... i can't wait to watch this...
She looks great,him..Not so much terrible cast..
It’s insane how that looks nothing like Lily
Looks like there is a lot of dramatic exaggerations
Why is no one talking about The RED SPEEDO!!! 🥵🥵🥵🥵 I know it's split second stuff... but...
they really ruin Pamela's carrear..Before all of that, she was the most beautiful and promising actress.I personally think that is not fair,something similar happened to Colin Farrel and Brad Pitt but they just blamed Pamela.
I think Lily James is going to be revelation here.
Dead ringer for Pam...Tommy not so much, dude looks like Chris Kattan.
YEAHHH!!! This looks fire!! I'm all in!
Dude I was first of all flabbergasted in general when I saw this trailer cuz I was like wow this looks fuckingawesome but then I was sitting here going who are these two people I know them I know these actors who are they and I had to look it up I was even more shocked to find out that's Lily James playing is Pam they did such a f****** good job with her transformation interacting is amazing to The Voice the way she moves her hands everything like dude I didn't even believe that was Lily until I looked it up. That's insane dude
everything about this looks amazing except the font
Not watching cause of Rogens woke antics as of late.  Sorry
Looks like they did a better job casting and filming than the Dirt..
Woooo lily james
Poor Pamela and Tommy they didn’t deserve that those nauseating perverts sold a tape of their private lives😡
Wow, this looks terrible.
reminder that Pamela Anderson didn't consent to this. they're just exploiting her trauma
Lily looks totally unrecognizable here!!!
Can’t believe y’all did this without Pamela Anderson’s approval. Absolutely disgusting and quite disappointing.
I wonder will Pamela and her son watch this interesting family viewing.
I have a copy. LOL
Oh Lord!!
I had NO idea Lily James was Pamela Anderson!!  Jesus Christ, the make-up is ON-POINT AF 👁👄👁❤️
I can’t wait 朗
Their new spouses are probably thrilled to watch this.
This looks rather pathetic
Award season they should get nominated!
Got seth rogen in not going anywhere near this, in fact canceling my hulu sub since i have used it in a couple months.
I can’t wait 朗
Wow🥰😅
trash
Wow! Seth Rogen without a beard?
Dear, people  I know this is contrary to what has your interest at the moment, but I’ve come to witness to you the incredible mercy of the Savior and King Jesus Christ. If you have ears to listen or eyes to see, let me give you a grave warning of God’s wrath. The only Way to escape God’s wrath is to REPENT and change your lives according to that of the life of Jesus Christ and His blood will cleanse you of your sins and you will have eternal life. Times are perilous, God’s wrath draws near, and time runs out, I promise this will undoubtedly be the best decision of your eternity. Romans 6:23 KJV- “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” This video could never offer what Jesus does.
3.5 million views and only 1.5k likes. Yikes
Best 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
He beat the heck out of her and now it’s a love story?
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈
Wow you guys are really Botting up your trailer huh?
oy vey
What's up with all the repetitive comments everywhere!?!
Is that Ron Swanson under the influence of  Tammy 2 ?
Weak
This is great news. Sebastian Stan did an outstanding job on his physical transformation for the role of Tommy Lee. He is such a gift to the world of entertainment. His ability to change his appearance so dramatically makes his characters more real on the screen, and far more believable. Wish all involved, the greatest success with this series.
Thanks for reminding me why I canceled my subscription
I can’t wait 🤩
looks incredible, i can’t wait!! so excited for sebastian to get his flowers, and lily’s transformation is amazing
You think they’ll follow up with a Kim Kardashian one? I mean it only makes sense, am I right?
Waiting for Kim and Ray J
This… looks bad
It seems to be great the Hulu Movie! 😊
Sebastian Stan seems extremely miscast in this.  Doesn't seem anything like Tommy.
We love you Sebb
release Seyfried's dropout trailer please
It sure looks good
and once again, sebastian's here with his incredible acting and God the transformation! 🥵
someone reserve their place for awards pls-
Incredible can't waitttt......
Trash. Next.
poor pamela, she deserves so much better
Who else literally feels like YouTube is their best friend during Covid ? 🐑🐑😆😆😆
N the emmy goes to ....SEBASTIAN STAN
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus
I watch the only vid I wanna see of these 2 on vhs years ago
Some how i read it as Ron and Tammy, but then I was surprised that there is Ron. 0:27
Used to love Pamela, but she's really nobody to idolize. 💁‍♀️
Happy 2.1 Million 🥳🍇
*Hey, to you reading* .. you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
*Wouldn't it be more poetic for everyone who wants to see this move to wait for the stolen underground version to hit the internet LOL!*
2.1M views with only 1K likes... these YT comments are as fake as IMDB now.
Haven't heard of this, had the trailer play as an ad before a video a bit ago, and as soon as I saw Lily James face at the beginning I said oh Pamela Anderson before I even knew it was supposed to be her. Took me halfway through the trailer at one moment I thought it might have been Lily James but then I kept thinking now no who is this. They did such an incredible job with the transformation.
BS
Lilly James doesn't look like Lilly James.
omg the hair makeup and styling is literally amazing
Sebastian was in ‘I, Tony’s’ too!!!
I’m only here for Sebastian 😂😂
She is amazing as Pamela!!
Will we ever see a borat cameo?
Seth Rogen? No thanks
Will they show how physically abusive Tommy was?
Is that Andrew Dice Clay?,, looks amazing!! I love Sebastian,,, and Lily looks just like Pam!! I can't wait to see it🤘
I can't wait to watch it on Hulu!
Lily looks more like Pam than Pam looks like Pam.
Thumbnail makes you think hulu just the got the rights to their 2 decade old sxtape 😁
How come Im not at all into Tommy Lee at all, but Im really into Sebastian Stan as Tommy Lee...
how to watch in UK
The Dirt,.... Part 2
Sebastian Stan and Lily James are on point
no thanks.
Does it come with hepatitis?
wow. 1 million views within 5 hours already??
looks like Boogie Nights / I Tonya / American Crime Story / Wonderland. True crime meets pop culture featuring great actors.
I was excited until I found out it's a series. Couldn't this just be a movie?
Not the kind of show one needs to watch though. What kind of message we are sending to upcoming generations make a tape for insta famous ???
oh no, not seth rogan!...ugh
This is adding on to my new obsession with the 90s
Asdfghjkl IM SO EXCITED 😭😭😭
Her American accent isn't good
Haven't we already seen inside Tommy and Pam? I distinctly remember Tommy saying I love you baby a bunch of times on the VHS tape LOL
they understood the assignment
👏🏻HERE👏🏻FOR👏🏻IT
looks incredible, i can’t wait!! so excited for sebastian to get his flowers, and lily’s transformation is amazing
Lily James out here proving me wrong
I wish they'd used Machine Gun Kelly again as Tommy, but I'll give it a go.  😈
I'm excited for this. I really liked 'I, Tonya'.
YEESSS
I am here for Sebastian. He always wanted to play a rocker and he finally got his chance!. He is going to rock this!!!
Is nick offerman replacing james franco
Sebastian and Lilly are going to serve in this 😌
This is so old and these guys are useless. Why do they still have a following?
I definitely gonna watch this.
Oh yeah, Seb and Lily are coming for Award Season and so is the hair and make up team. It's eerie how much Seb and Lily look like Pam and Tommy. Lily and Seb Understood the Assignment.
Director of I’Tonya and Lilly James is enough to sell me on it
Yes. Sebby baby can't wait for it.
Finally a decent movie! 😄Pam looks very authentic. It can be seen that the filmmakers have done a good analysis ... Well done😄
When she was cast I was worried about her Bust…. But makeup and costume did a great job!!!😂😈😂😈
great.... when I thought my Sebastian Stan phase was over..... lol
Seth Rogan hasn't changed no matter how woke he seems on social media.
do Kim next!!
Wow! Lily is stunning in this version
This series going to be crazy.....
You can barely recognize Lily James as Pam
Lily James transformation is a 10 out of 10. Is it all makeup or CGI?
This might be the most craziest show to be based on a true story ever.
This and The Dropout are the Hulu projects I'm most excited for. Lily Collins is unrecognizable
Nice
🐤🤍 good
Pam didn't approve this! They shouldn't have made this series. Making someone revisit the trauma they suffered is not right. Also imagine how their kids who are grown up now will feel looking at this?   THIS JUST AIN'T IT!!
Sebastian is spectacular actor
i so cannot wait!!!
