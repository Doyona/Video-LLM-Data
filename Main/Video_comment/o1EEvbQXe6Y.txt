Navia Crying
Navia  good
1:48  THIS PART IS SO GOOD
Umbrella warfare, I guess
Ist das ne Anspielung von Der Pate?
poor guard!! said navia put down umbrella plsss🥺
The music here sounds like it’s from Kirby, and I’m all here for it
Please give me navia Genshin
ну вот почему она не хочет мне выпадать
Когда мне плохо я открываю этот трейлер и пошло поехало пересмотр всех трейлеров
I FINALLY GOT HER TODAYYY
I managed to get both her and her weapon during her first re-run. And honestly, she's got to be my favorite geo character. I adore her so much, and I'm building a team around her. She's so much fun!
MAY EVERY NAVIA WANTERS BE HAVERS! (including me)
SHE IS SO PRINCESS DAISY CODED AND I LOVE IT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Я русский и услышал как навия сказала "привет" на русском
What is the name of the music from the video?
I get she, I'm so happy🎉🎉
i am guaranteed but i can't decide between navia and raiden
her rerun is today
NAVIA WILL COME HOMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
LINDAAAAAA
navia my queen PLEASE come home ilysm
WOW
Navia vendra a casa
Why does she have the design of the Swire from Arknights?
navia's design gameplay is aboslutely PERFECT!  WHOS EXICYED FOR HER BANNER IN 5.6?.
navia my beloved
My main💛
Навия многих пацанов свела с ума в хорошем смысле - высокая, стройная, голубоглазая красавица, к тому же с печальной историей, ловкая, сильная и проворная. Что ещё надо?
I like how Navia is just casually posing in the last clip with fighting the thief like if Klee just blew up something lol
and she does all that in HEELS Fintaine characters are truly built different
That's my wife yall
Natschuka!
Even while she’s fighting she literally looks BEAUTIFUL
Navia uses American element
NAVIA IS THE BEST GIRL AND BEST CHARACTER FIGHT ME
Best character demo!
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
Give me a rerun Hoyo and my life is yours
Que horrible es el doblaje en Ingles
0:46 I Literally Saw Charlotte
DO I SEE A CHARLOTTE? 👀
she's amazing. thats all i got
she kinda gives mia fey vibes i love her
She should've been fontaines archon (if she was hydro)
So, her super is naval canon?
Fontaine Ninguang basically  I love them perfect characters
She is my first 5 star🎀💕
Navia podond Rose
Navis my precious daughter ;;;0;;;
Navia makes me want to join French mafia
❤❤❤
RIP Melus and silver
Where is this? I can’t find it anywhere T-T
No joke I searched up Genshin Taylor Swift and this was the first video that popped up
WITH HEELS..?😭
Better call Saul
Never been so proud to have her. (I got her by accident)
Doesn’t Nadia work for Chiori?
WHY DID THE 50/50 GODS FORSAKE MEEE
0:32 so badass
The umbrella gun is literally gintama's yato clan
Melus and Silver are the GIGACHADS
Navia my beloved❤
At first i didnt like the music that much but after hearing it performed at the orchestra this themes a banger
Her brightness makes her more of a pyro
love herr!
my love
Music is FIRE
rip melus and silver you would've loved this
I need a hoyo mix from this
Piper in another universe
Even while chasing someone she still manages to look absolutely FABULOUS
Please Genshin Impact release the Navia demo's instrumental, I've been waiting for almost a year
Lynette being there was pure coincidence 😂
I love Navia Soo much!!✨👑👑👑💛
AGENT GOLDILOCKS POPPINS is on the case!
R.I.P Melus and Silver
This is by far the BEST Genshin character demo ever. I love her sm<33
She so elegant
I'm sorry this is peak Genshin trailer and character development
Bro got clipped
Please make the 5.2 phase 2 banner a navia
steampunk darling im in love with
I8ssme
8 love you navia
8 kove you nadia
Taylor Swift??
Her weapon looks like a polearm weapon
MARY POPPINS?
Piper song turoral
"Boss you just shot him with a 12 gauge. I think he's dead"
She says "a proper send off" but I always heard "a full crescendo"
No me gustan los geo pero debo de aceptar que ella tiene estilo
One of the best Fontaine character.
I love Navia, she is best girl..❤
close enough welcome back katsuya serizawa
el mejor diseño de personaje de todo el juego hasta ahora
Navia ❤️
I love how she drops on top of someone from very high up but just yells "Hey, there!"
Navia main here, pulling for her was the BEST decision I've made since Genshin's release.
Btw she did that with heels
fuy tried to play Mirror's Edge was caught in the vipers nest
Music?
If anyone here has a Navia I claim your Navia for my own
ну моя)
*_Largo alla donzella?_*
I wanted to summon her in honor of Melus and Silver-        But i failed💀
1:47 MY favourite part ❤
Today is Navia Caspar Birthday.
Navia cpas bao nhiêu bộ đồ ạ ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Tbh I think she is really good even if she is a claymore and geo ❤
i lost my 50/50 on her ughhhh :((
1:29 ЛИНЕТТ?
The fact she is running in heels
I hate Navia I accidentally wished on her banner and I got her c1
Just pulled her🤭
My babe in love with her character and eng voice actor after Fontaine archon quest. i had to pull 152 tho, anything for my queen. lynette mentioned in her voiceline "navia is a big sister to her, she wish navia was a member of "house of hearth".
First few seconds in..  "unfortunately, he's got a good nose"  OMG LMAO the reference .. the first i saw Navia was actually from a cosplayer doing her skirt and lower body ... It looked so good and i saw the character.. ever since then i fell in love with her design! Now.. was lucky to win my 50/50 and now a Navia main!  She's so good!  (2 months playing) And getting her ascension materials was fun!
Got her. Really like her looks and her character. Another ojou-sama type <3
Can someone tell me what the name of the Theme is in the Hoyo-Mix Albums?
Wish the song was in the HoyoMix or something, it’s sooo good!
I finally got her at 85 pity so happy
Navia please come to me please...
Navia has a SHOTGUN UMBRELLA! Seems like a character straight out of RWBY. She's that awesome!
Estou muito feliz por ter conseguido essa personagem tão carismática, linda e muito forte ao mesmo tempo ❤🎉
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Navia is the geo queen
0:01 sounds like "Better Call Saul" meme
Sorry for asking such a question here, but when I heard the motif that repeats through the whole video ( 0:54 is the clearest example) I remembered that it sounded like one melody from Megaman; does anyone know about the theme I'm looking for? If you could tell me I would thank you.
Her existence made me questionin why i pulled itto
why is lynette always eating them up..
Afrer 7 months I can't stop watching this masterpiece, Navia, thanks for being my main
plss, come homee navia!
hoyo pls
My princess ❤❤❤
Just got her and kaveh. First try
I got her from those free 1600 primogens<3
I got her<3
She has rerun now .. i want yelan but she came when im building my pity
❤
My note to Silver, and Melus: I WILL protect Navia no matter what. I will fulfill your duties. *gives flowers in the note* (Dw! These flowers are for meant for parting and wish for reunion, try to guess it.) I hope I will see you both again someday. Thank you for saving Navia when she almost got dissolved in the Primordial Water. You are in good hands. Do not worry, Navia will always remember you two. You were her two true companions. I believe you will protect and be with us, always. Goodbye, Silver and Melus. We will miss you dearly.😢                                                                                                                                                                                                     Love,                                                                                                                                                                                                          Bunni712.
I'm shipping Wriothesley and Navia so hard.
I love her sm- I need herr
Shes so cool oml
i’m gonna get navia
I’m sorry Navia, I already got Furina recently in this banner. I don’t have prinos anymore so I might skip u 😭😭😭
NAVIA DO SO MUCH DAMICH ON MY SCRIME!!!!!!
She may of lost everything but that only strengthed her resolve to make sure no one else loses anyone or anything else for as long as she can help it, also props to lynette assisting.
0:34 That transition is so smooth, fits well with the music!!!❤
Navia is SO AMAZING!! I’m definitely going to try for her after 4.8, but I kinda need to get Zhongli first 😅
Mami Tomoe <3
HOYO, LET ME HAVE HER
БОЖЕЕЕЕ МОЙЙЙЙЙ ОНА ТАКАЯ КРАСИВАЯ😍💓
For everyone going to pull for her in 4.8 i wish you goodluck
HOYO LET ME GET HER EARLY IN 4.8😍
THE TRANSITION WAS FABULOUS
Whose here after seeing the 4.8 banner
proud to be named navia now
2:10  CRIME SCENE LOL😭😭😭
She's like Mami from PMMM
he got arrested 2,7 millions time now ( number of views ) ( i am 1million alone )
I love her... 💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛
This is why my main is navia
As a HSR fan, im officially a fan of her now. Navia best girl
Navia rerun 🤞🏻
0:12 was that a tangled reference? 😭
Why is everyone in Fontaine so damn stylish
Navia is an amazing character❤
The scene where she takes her umbrella and glides down on the enemy reminds me of Marry Poppins ngl 😅
The Macaron Mafia ❤️
ナヴィアが英語似合いすぎる❤
I want to imagine that Navia summons canons by having her men simply following her all around with canons ready to be deployed as soon she uses her Burst.
owww Navia! she looks like the Mafia at the end of the video!🤩🤩🤩
This Demo is just so fun to watch over and over again...
This is fking underrated trailer
She slay (I cannot wait for her rerun)
actual definition of girlboss
Just this PV alone is better than Wuthering waves's trailer
Heh amazing pv this one :D I like music and everything. Character design is awesome too. If she came two years eariler she could have chance to compete with Zhongli PV I think
M-MOMMY?
Everything about her just slaps!
Quickly became one of my favorite genshin characters. Very happy to have gotten her on my team😊
my fav weapon shotbrella
Guinevere with Kagura
would
i was rooting for the thief tbh
Navia is the female version of THUG LIFE
2:12 I thought Saul Goodman main theme was about to start 💀
Mas pra que entrar e matar no jogo. Deveriam viver em união e serem onestos e crer EM JESUS CRISTO AMÉM 💖🌟🌟💖💖
I LOVE THISS
Don Navia
0:46 charrelot just chilling
1:37
When Navia rerun again……
4.3 is my favourite event from all of them, damn
WE BRINGING A FREEDOM WITH THIS ONE❗️🗣🗣❗️🔥🔥🦅🗣🇺🇲🗣🦅🗣🦅🇺🇲🗣🇺🇲🗣🇺🇲🗣🇺🇲🗣🦅
im so sad i cant get any good characters so im just watching random demos
This is not France This is AMERICA 🗣🗣🗣🦅🦅🦅🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
She's such a good boss 😂😂
Navia reminds me of Marin Kitagawa a lot
I like navia how scene 0:34 and 0:50
0:46 Blink and you'll miss her, but I found Charlotte
I wish navia hade an little deeper voice
Well she sure is moving up my wish list, my poor primogems
shes so classy i love her
rizz lee is better
КАКИЕ ГЕНИИ ДЕЛАЮТ ТРЕЙЛЕРЫ ГЕНШИНА,ГОСПОДИ,ЭТО ВЕЛИКОЛЕПНО
Im in love with her.
I wish Navia really did that little twirl before she summoned the cannons thats such a nice feminine touch 😢
It's the fact that Lynette helping Navia is the most watched part of this video for me.
Navia: takes a while to catch treasure hoarder  Me with wanderer charged atk: 1:30
🔥👉🕳
NAVIA SLAYYYYYY
umm boss maybe we should get him to a doctor first. I died lol!
Gos the music is SO GOOD
Why did you give me Ayato instead of Navia😢😢😢
Love how they made a strong, independent girlboss without making her cliche. She’s gorgeous, and fierce. ❤
as I'm here still listening to this until the album is released, I realize we're not going to have cool sound effects like 1:57 where the cannon shots are timed with the audio
the ad was ridiculous as a non player, if there's a thief why would you open your umbrella and pose like that bruh😭
00:46 Charlotte cameo
MY DPS QUEEN I LOVE HER
Lol the Indonesian subtitles seemed to be translated from English and Chinese.🤣
SHES THE PRETTIEST CHARACTER IN THE GAME I LOVE HER SO MUCH 🧡🧡✨
such an adorable fluffball
Pls let the leaks be true and get a rerun in 4.8😭🙏
Navia is so beautifull
BEST DEMO OF ALL TIME FR
0:33 Navia hadn't eaten that apple yet she threw it away, what a waste of food ;–;
She saved the geo
everyone talks about navia but one one talks about the thief. The guy damn near esacped navia and the spina.
Is Navia the genshin version of The Penguin the same way Diluc is Genshin Batman? I mean she is kind of a mafia boss, uses a gunbrella, and lives underneath the city in a sort of sewer system.
she is so 😎
Remember the fact that she’s doing all of this in heels-
Love ❤❤❤❤
La mejor canción que a sacado hoyoverse es simplemente hermosa
I love her sm I want her so bad
God lynette coming at the right time 😂😂😂
If Melus and Silver turned to oceanids before she became an official character why are they in her trailer?
fire video fire character fire song fire story fire effects RAAAAAH NAVIA BEST CHARACTER
Navia Swift
if anyone say mary poppins ?!.not again.mary poppin with hidden super shotgun.say...Doom guy on very girly version.Doom Girls.
Navia reminds me of Timekeeper from Cookie run due to how chaotic, yellowish and just carefree they are LMAO
If by any chance you invited to her house, first thing you have to do is bow your head and kiss her hand

THE MUSIC IS FIRE WHAT THE
I STOPPED PLAYING FOR MONTHS AND OMFG I CAME BACK TOO LATE SHE'S SO COOL I NEED HER
Navia seems like the Genshin better call saul
i wish i was that thief
Navia is my favorite favorite crime fighter 🤩🤩🤩🥰💙🚔😎
SHE'S SO GORGEOUS, IM GONNA CRY-
woah Navia you gotta chill
剪得太好了❤ 剪輯師該加薪
When i've got her I was like woah that was a quick pity..Then I was glad I got her weapon because I wanted her AXE WEAPON. Navia,Furina,and Hu Tao are the only 3 ones I wanted as a weapon.
Addicted to Navia trailer 🤩
Did Hoyomix release this song yet? I can't seem to find it.
First character i manage to simp in first time playing G.Impact ( also my first 5* maybe im lucky )
I aint doing the archon quest until natlan comes out, I dont want silver and melus dying😭😭😭
Two words MANIAC ELEGANT😂😂😂
That thief truly deserves an Oscar for that acting, and Navia's men. Especially them, I could only imagine the scenarios. . .
I just realised that the first drop (not 3x speed Decode drop) of Endgame by Waterflame syncs perfectly with the first appearance of Navia
SHES SO PERFECTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
2:12 Saul Goodman 😂
Yo, seriously. Hoyoverse can't keep getting away with making most other game tracks, sound subpar with just their character demos lol... 😌
I actually quit genshin then idk this character anymore ._.
I am beginning player but i spin 35 pretty luck I take NAVIA...today Adventure RANK 50  i love it Character NAVIA . just one  month atchivement 360  world level 6
My fav :P
Why isn't Melus and Silver not in the ads? Never forget!
1:43 Activate the Honda-beat
She makes me wanna try the gamr
Navia alone revive the whole geo element 😭😭😭
2:13 i love this part so much LMAO
Navia casually dragged the thief outside the city so she can beat him up some more
This Demo was released on my birthday how did I not notice that omg!!!!🤩🤩🤩😊😊😊
Bro got oppa gandam style glasses
Damn...
Navia The Boss 😎💛
I LVOE HER OH MY GOD 😭❤
I love navia so much
The only person Who strikes a pose while chasing a criminal
1:28 my baby
This woman is like green lantern, but with geo element instead
That's one strong umbrella
Is her voice higher pitched in this?
My biggest regret when I didn't comeback to the game when her banner is up. Now I feel empty. She's so beautiful, her outfit, skill kit, umbrella, shades, everything.
The characters need safty course so no one is getting hurt
Well yeah Navia Swift
Damn... English dub eliminates all the joy. Adding English to Genshin characters is like adding sugar to a whiskey shot
Marvelous screenplays & shots.
Navia is one of the best characters and very sweet, the video is great, and the music is awesome!👍
Reinstalled just for her... Next, Skirk (if ever)
Should I get Navia or Raiden Shogun for new Genshin players?
RIP Silver and Melus 😔💔
I’m gay panic
I have watched this 27 times now just for the song
Why is Navia so perfect in every sense of the word and how I love her so much ❤
Unpredictable, but evidently not nearly as clever as they thought he was.
I want to cry, it’s so cool
XD me gusta su personalidad
seru banget anjir waifu baru song theme nya juga seruu
Spina di rosula member: um... Boss, we might need to get him to a doctor first... Navia, after beating the living daylights out of the criminal: ..... Oops 😅
Lynette is Fontaine’s qiqi she has to be in every Fontaine demo
She has a Princess Peach sort of vibe 🫶
She looks like the Russian empire flag
Ladies and gentlemen, we do NOT got her 😭
She did all that in heels such a slay 🤭
like the lynette part :)
i love her she is so sillyyy
I haven’t got any luck together😢
The cutiest VA so far haha
Got her my first wish of the entire game ✨✨
this is one of the worst character demo
Gorgeous
Lynette cameo is the best part
The Geo Archon Blessed me with Her in 56 Pitym She came home in a single pull while I was on 55. My Teapot consists of all Geo characters while I myself sit as Zhongli in front of the Statue m Now it will be Itto or Chiori.
And then keaya’s trailer: 🏃🏊‍♂🧗🤸
I got Navia first try at 4
FIRE
You shall rest in peace Melus and Silver.
Hoyo knows exactly what theyre doing w that thumbnail xD
goated
Navia is so cool that she wears sunglasses to protect the sun from her glance 😎
She seems really cool, but her voice doesn't fit her character. I think a bit of a deeper / more mature sounding voice would've been the better pick.
Guys let’s just face it…Navia is the geo version of klee
I love how her power is GUNS  She can turn her umbrella in a GUN. She can spawn CANNONS from thin air.
I LOVE HER I LOVE HER I LOVE HER
Dio..is that you?...
I like how just having her put on sunglasses shows so much personality
Taylor swift
BLESSED STARS THE MUSIC IS A BOP
THE MUSIC
Princesses are kind, gentle, innocen-  Mihoyo : Hold my beer
You can actually see Charollette at 0:46
i searched taylor swift songs but this video pops out
Navia needs to be the standard for Geo characters going forward (and possibly used as a means to overhaul existing Geo characters)
No suelo tirar por personajes que no usare, pero WOW que personaje tan entrañable...!! necesitaba tenerla en mi cuenta y soy muy feliz :)
Lynete so cute
I can see Charlotte in 0:46
she's basically a mix of Yang, Ruby, and Neo.
It's like an 19 s detective movie
What operation ?
the lynette part made me smile
2:19  Forget the doctor, that soldier boy deserves therapy 😅😅😅😅
I got her😭✨
2:13 "easy white chocolate. I wouldn't want you to melt😎"
shes so girly and badass i love her :( ❤
Small fact: the music is from masha and the bear sampled
alguém pode me ajudar? minha conta era vinculada pelo twitter mas eu desativei essa conta a um certo tempo e eu naoo sei meu usuário no genshin, por mais q eu saiba o uid e a senha eu n consigo entrar pq n tenho o usuário. tem como resolver?
minha mulher💞💞💞💞 a lynette aparecendo KKKKKKKKKKKK
Seeing Navia wall-running and parkouring through the streets to chase her target, all while looking fabulous the whole time... how could you not find her awesome?
Navia feels like she came straight outta rwby and I’m here for it
0:45 charlotte in frame
i've rewatched this video so often but only now did i notice that she wears a glove on her right hand
Ah yes Yukari Yakumo got into Genshin she got bored with Ran and Chen. She has new companions Silver and Melus, but then has a more poor fate than the companions in Gensokyo.
There need sponsor
Yoimiya  trailer vibes
ААА Я ЛЮБЛЮ НАВИЮ В ВИДЕО ОНА ТАКАЯ КРУТАЯ
Kingsman umbrella
The first time she was in your house in the morning
why does she make a loop around pole
Линяет так мило показала наверх ☺️
0:27 Asmongold watching dark souls speedrun
The song is fantastic
I’m telling you guys Layla gets NO RESPECT it’s her BIRTHDAY and we get a post about NAVIAAAAHWJWNWNWHEHBEGRGRGRGRGRGR
This video is dissolved in my brain, like Silver and Melus 🤩
Now genshin has a spy organization called the Golden Circle
realest genshin character i fear
1:38 thats really my favourite those sirens 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Update: my bank account is in recovery like the thief in the demo, but Navia is home
am I the only one that expect her voice to be elegant because of her clothes and looks?
there us this concept id like to talk about called "white girl swag"
this is so peak
anybody else think better call saul when that first guitar chord is played at 2:11 cause i cant unhear it now
Навия покорила мое сердце и она у меня дома. Я так ей рада. Очень понравилась с трейлера Фонтейна.
She must be a waitress cause she SERVED
I started playing genshin impact a few day's ago and right now I'm saving up to get her
LYNETTE!!
NAVIA IS HERE
Wait did I just hear a EHE from her
2:11 better call saul reference
Mafia: unfortunately he has a good nose. He’s unpredictable too which is how hes eluded us thus far...  Sea shadow: literally walks up to their turf few second later
The way Melus and Silver SHOULD HAVE been in this demo man.
1:30 Lynette over here being a true friend and lending Navia an airship. This is why she’s my favorite 4 Star in Fontaine!🤣
I love her so much. Too bad shes geo
Charlotte looking absolutely flabbergasted
The best music of a demo IS here
i just hope the Upgrade doesn't has too many Files
stunning
I wanted navia's plunge attack Be like she would use her umbrella to slow down The fall
This one's got your NAME ON IT!! :3
No regrette  !!❤❤ best with ninnuang
0:04 rapaz que coincidência
She protect... She attack... But most importantly...      *she send the thief to see a doctor*
Спасибо большое за Навию, она великолепна
the electric guitar strum sounds similar to the one on itto's demo. beyond that, these characters are alike in so many ways  -geo -claymore -gang boss -broke -broken -dps -itto was the last geo before navia -dead parents -has an old timer (granny oni and meluse) -associated with and helped a small community (blue oni clan and poisson) -their favorite food are sweets
Chica rubia con lentes de sol una escopeta y un paraguas? SOY TODO TUYO
Am i the only one who think navia's voice became pitchier?
2:12 "Wake the f*** up samurai, we have a city to burn"
Me who got navia on Christmas when I first pulled:
2:11 Reminds me of "Saul Goodman"
That treasure hoarder is my favourite now tbh
Lynnet literally😑☕👆
Панталончики!
so we got mogged...
She's so prettyy
Shoutout to Navia for keeping up w this guy in a long skirt and heels. Stan Lethal Mary Poppins
SHE IS SO PRETTYYY
Which song?
Speed 0,75x you should try it
Dpo4y
The amount of detail that’s on Navia and the demo is just insane,they clearly put in a lot of effort in this
All hail the new Geo Archon 😎
THE THEME
Irl, that treasure hoarder would die with one shot of Navia's elemental skill
I got her today I am so happy‼️
I WILL NOT RE-DOWNLOAD THE GAME FOR HER NO NONO I WILL NOT I LOVE HER SHE IS MY WIFE BUT I CANT DOWNLOAD THE GAME AGAIN NONONONONOOO
I love the little curtsy she does after kicking the axe. Adds a nice charm and flair.
Navia is the best christmas gift
Not a free character, another primo-trap. Best avoid this game until they respect user mental health.
2:10 I can’t be the only one who thinks this part came from that meme (💣😎🍑) and it’s SO COOL if it’s really intentionally that meme 🤯
finally i got her on christmas gift💝
Это лучший тизер за все годы геншин( у кейи лучше)
Lmfao I love Navia, I miss Melus and Silver tho T^T
My not ascended level 60, no talent, bad weapon, bad artifacts made 30k damage
Ok but how unlucky are you to evade all detection from law enforcement, escape into the sewers, and then stumble into the headquarters of the detective agency
LET'S GO TAYLOR SWIFT!!!!!!
Why she has so young voice, jez... for who is that appealing even?  And again a generic NPCs with the same faces - showing portrait of a wanted guy, with obviously has the same face as them; except it's covered... Yet they instantly recognize culprit out of 29034 other NPCs (with the same face)... because he hid face in the same way / NPCs never changes clothes? Ridiculously stupid.
Can't we ignore the fact that she's doing all these in high heels?💀💀💀
got her 2 pity
AGH I WANTED TO SEE CLORINDE BUT I APPRECIATE LYNETTE TOO girlie sipping on tea while big chilling 🤣 Navia girlboss has always been confirmed but the running on heels just...what xD her umbrella opened with strong winds but not getting turned inside out. It's very well-made 🤨
she's so beatiful, i love her
like the spanish guitar theme
i love her, i need her
Merry xmas, just got her at 12:01, freakin ritual works,
Navia is one of the best character in Fontaine arc. I'm glad Hoyo did'nt ruin her playstyle and kit
She slay sm
2:12 not a cyberpunk reference💀
2:14 wake up samurai, we have a city to burn 😅
Bond, Navia Bond 007~
i got her on my alt that i dont use anymore but not my mainnn 😭
O fato de que os dois cavalheiros que a acompanham nao serem os mesmos me entristesse demais...
I know I’m not tripping, but if anyone managed to spot Charlotte in the trailer then you’re a legend
Please let us use her umbrella as a glider !! ☂️
Sometimes, I forget that Geo characters can create Geo constructs and those large cannons are probably Navia's geo constructs HAHAHAHAHA
NAVIA SWIFT
she's such a girlboss i adore her
I NEED NAVIAAAAAAAA😢😢😢
She's the definition of 'That bad b*tch' I LOVE HER
She has such a fun personality I'm loving these Fontaine character demos!!
Я ВЫБИЛА ЭТУ БОГИНЮ 💋
i dont know her but i love her
Actually their best character demo video yet. The transitions were so smooth. The bits of comedy, Navia with the apple, this whole thing was gold, just as Geo mains would want.
French Rose
OMG THE SONG İS PERFECT!!!!!!!!
Come home
Fabulous!!
cant get the Better call Saul soundtrack out of my head
2:12 that thief better call Saul
SLAYEEDDD
Is her voice different?  Either way still LOVE this demo
AHHHHHH! TAYLOR SWIFTTT?!?!
Alright demos are actually getting crazy now
It's very bad my ex girlfriend's name was also navia
It's also a gun!!!
看到她戴墨鏡我真的一直笑
I LOVE HER AKJSHDKJHDA
key change at the end really made me goosebumps
HELP SHE'S SOOOOOO PRETTY
She is Mafia. With Gun, superngun. Black glassses. BlackSuite ànd Axe.
Her voice sounds off alot more high pitch
She can run so fast even in high heels.
Me encanta Navia desde la primera vez que la vi es perfecta 🌟🌟🌟🌟
Help why does she slay so much 😩😩😩😩💅💅💅
Not to sound like a Allogene supremacist, but why do the normies of this world seem to keep thinking they can stand a chance against Vision holders? They're _quite literally_ demigods.
The demo is as perfect as Navia i can’t get tired of it this is absolutely insane
Navia doing objection pose
brutal
Cyberpunk 777
TAYLOR NAVIA SWIFT YOU WILL BE MINE
deus abençoe
I’ve watched this 6 times. And I will continue to watch it. FAVORITE CHARACTER DEMO!!!
Navia, please come home..
are we not gonna talk about navia doing all of it in HEELS.
ICONIC
Probably one of the best made character demo in a long time
I love how how Lynette was there
Omgg she's so beautiful!
police brutality
SHE DID ALL THAT IN HEELS?!
HOYO GIVE ME MY NAVIAAAA WHY DID YOU GIVE ME DILUC😭😭😭
1:29 lynette same as alway with her expression without speaking and point her teaspoon upward xDD
TAYLOR SWIFTT 🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣
spoiler           rip melus and silver, you two shall never be forgotten for your good deeds </3
i love her so much!!! but im not gonna get her. ill get her weapon first
> Stylish exagerated and colorful design > Parkour in heels > "That's also a gun"  Are you sure she's not a lost RWBY character ? Lol
PLEASE HOYOVERSE I'M BEGGING YOU GIVE ME NAVIA PLSSS I'M LITERALLY BEGGING, I'VE SPENT MONEY ALREADY SO PLEASE, MAKE ME WIN 50/50 THREE TIMES IN A ROW
claymore swift
Чел который делал трейлер кейи вернулся и сделал нам трейлер фурины и навии
Just to let you know Hoyo, I am saving up for her rerun, both Navia and her signature weapon. Thank you.
Queen
Taylor Swift world tour with all the places they're going in all these transitions
c6r5😎 🌂 🌼🌺
This is so clean
Lol why does she remind me of guinever and kagura😅
I swear i thought she was just gonna shoot that guy in the back as he passed.
Wooo I got her
The chaotic-ness of her trailer reminds me of klee 😭
She truly a Group Mafia :v
and now wait for 2 years for it to be released on Spotify
I know I should be simping but I miss Silver and Melus 😭😭😭😭😭
2:11 the breaking bad chords go so hard badass Navia
CSI FONTAINE
Forget navia I want the thief as a playable character
reminder she did allat in heels
I still think Hoyoverse missed the opportunity for Navia to glide using her umbrella, but would be harder to animate and I love playing Navia all the same
Быстрые ноги 3,14зды не получат говорили они...
THIS MUSIC IS SUCH A BOP!!!!!
shes an icon, shes a legend and she is the moment!!!
NAAH SHE OP BROTHER
🍓
I love how taylor swift just poses in the middle of a chase like she's doing it for fun.
They really put their entire hoyussy to the geo claymore boss character's trailers and I'm so here for it👑✨️
fontaine lisa 🔥
DAMN,MY PRIMOGEMS😭 she is so gorgeous wahh
It’s really worth pulling for her she’s really easy to use
0:46 There's also Charlotte cameo aside from Lynette. It all happened so quick.
aaaa es muy linda
Какая же Навия прелестная! Хотя я ещë и не получила Навию, но я знаю что она очень сильна☺
Lynette is the *real* MVP!
Cool girls don't look at explosions
Won 50/50 and within 40 pulls to boot huehue. The key was to actually not wanting her at all, I just wanted to gamble.
Hi(●’◡’●)ﾉ
The best demo ever haha
SHE'S A GIRL BOSS! I want her so badly, but sadly I feel like I wont have the literal luck to get her since I got Keqing on Cyno's banner. so I feel like I'm on soft pity but she's so epic and cool! I really love this girl.
Oh no I’m so close to throwing out all my plans on pulling for Raiden and pulling for Navia instead because of Navia’s trial run in game, the videos I’ve seen of her and now this. I was planning to pull for Raiden since I missed her by 3 or 4 pulls last year… but now I really want Navia…. But if I skip Raiden then I’ll have to wait a whole year to get her (at least if double banners stay)… if I skip Navia then who knows when she’ll have her first rerun.
The animation is so clean ! This demo is amazing!
11qq
durandal
Очень похож ролик как было у Е Лань)
she's so pretty
She’s low key serving psychopathic energy and we’re all here for it. Gods luck everyone pulling for her
I LOVE HER SO MUCH BEST CHARACTER YET😩😩😩💖💖
2:14 "easy there white chocolate I wouldn't want you to melt" ahh scene
Nananavia!!!~
just lost to tighnari, bout to finally scoop up 2 years worth of content I neglected for her.
Кто как, а я уже выбила эту идеальную женщину
LITERALLY THE PRETTIEST THE COOLEST MOST BADASS GIRLBOSS TO EVER GIRLBOSS THE ENTIRE TEYVAT
this was funny
Gives off the Spanish, Italian vibe
SLEIGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
i got navia in 1 try yesterday....when i saw it....i couldnt believe my eyes... i was soo surprised...  before that i decided that i dont do wish for very very long time...but i said...lets try it at least once after i passed ar 42(only after ar42 it started giving me stuff with 5 stars witch before ar42 never did)
NAVIA IS STANDING ON BUSINESS
As soon as this came out on genshin, i pulled for her, and got her one shot💀👍
Nice character demo
music is 🔥🔥🔥
Navia the first character to make me spend money
I can tell the NPC at the start is voiced by ProZD/SungwonCho, he's got an easily recognizable voice!
AND THESE CHARACTERS DO THIS IN HEELS😭
Dude I watched this demo like 3 times because the music is so good! Like damn this is good enough to be a standalone release let alone an OST for demo
save me navia... navia... navia save me...
What the fck have you done to her voice? Bring old voice back! #fixnavia!
That´s a really good umbrella
Oriana from Shadow in Eminence 😶‍🌫️
I got her at pity 31 I’m so happy !!
that was incredible, the angles,the cut the character animations the transitions, the music, this was awesome!
This feels more like an action movie trailer than a character demo.
She’s the prettiest genshin character idc
oh my lord its taylor swift
0:51 omg she looks like peach
My sibling spent 100 dollars to get her
❤❤❤Надеюсь я смогу выбить это леди.❤❤❤
Mommy Navia
She just came out and i got her today
The one on the Roses and Muskets OST has more livelier tune and much to my liking, while this has a more deaf tone yo it
I just payed 109,99€ and still didn’t get her. WTF!!!
Someone on the team clearly loves The Lonely Island. Both "I'm On A Boat" and "Cool Guys Don't Look At Explosions" fit in so well into parts of this.
I pulled for her and I got a C5 Barbara who isn’t on the banner and then lost the 50/50 to Keqing. I’m f2p though so I can’t really complain
How fast her previous two companions were replaced.
I f1cking love you navia please please come home again c1 already please come home my darling NAVIAAA🛐🛐
İ keep listening from 1:53
No shot they added Taylor swift in genshin impact 💀
She's so cool!!!! The music is amazing and the animation is WOW. So good!
navia should be giving democracy on fontaine
I don’t get it,where the hell did she get the canon from????
She can just open her umbrella in a speeding boat!? She's stupid strong!
She would fit well in the RWBY universe
Leave Bennet and Furina alone, create new supports.
Navia is from america brothes
My most loved girl since Yoimiya release
Wtf is that child's voice for her tho
I can't help but play this part 0:23 so many times, it's just so funny to me and the guitars make it even better.
I want to see Navia and Itto interact, I feel like they’d get along super well! They’re both so silly, both being bosses as well.
I got her today
I've been a Navia main since I found her (Today), she's very strong and well also beautiful hehe
genshin IT girl, irrefutable
Mary Poppins
she's so fun
Amei demais.
I can't believe they added Taylor Swift to Genshin Impact
Na'viad win
i love how elegant Navia is while also being playful and full of energy! the animation was awesome and smooth! hopefully i get Navia!!
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
MI NOVIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
navia rizz too strong she can have my raiden budget
Saved over 135 wishes for her, I'm hoping she'll come home!
TAYLOR SWIFT!!!
show us everything what is not possible in game
ЭТО СЛИШКОМ ЭПИЧНО
Spina di rosula agents are just so random and laughable its so cute xdd
as a heizou main, uhhh (lowkey) GEO HEIZOU???
lynette is kinda cuteeee
At this complete point I’m going insane because my storage. I can’t download the new update which means I can’t play. And it’s not like I can do anything. Because I do YouTube- I need my recording software and things to do etc. What’s with your games and taking so much storage. Genshin is on Steam or Epic Games, right?
Taylor Swift.
My dad asked me to pull for Navia in his ps4 acc, he saved up to at least 80 pulls getting Navia in 65 pulls and the extra pulls for her weapon (we didn't get the weapon tho but he's happy to get Navia)
Navia's design perfectly represents the picture of a Fontainian lady. She looks so gorgeous <3
FEARLESS
Navia ! She is here !
Didn't know Taylor Swift was that strong
Am I the only one who thinks that claymore (especially big axe) doesn't suit her?
Thats really hard inspired by rwby
JESUS okay I did not expect to be almost crying of just how good this is. I feel like my mind needs time to proccess everything and watch it multiple times because of how insane this is.
and she did all that in HEELS and a DRESS  the literal definition of a girlboss
I want to learn more about the guy called “Sea Shadow”. Maybe they can make a quest so we can learn more about him?
Taylor swift in disguise lmao
Day 4226 of spreading Italian Navia propaganda
Already pull her 50/50....man feeling lucky today
I must’ve not paid attention because she’s taller than I thought
2:12 Better Call Saul
Sounds like M2U composed this. :D
It was the sunglasses that got me
See you in unspecified number of years saying "Lady Yvetta is Navia copy", though the latter was created 6 years prior.  Totally awesome trailer by the way. As to design it's good, dope sunglasses. Not a fan of black colors and geo element, and I think forming her name out of "navy" is pretty uninspired, but not exactly bad. I like her. Maybe I will be able to get her if I'll finally return to Genshin someday, will look into her more closely.
mommy😊
Дали ордер на арест.  Итог: Избили и расстреляли
I love the Lynnete featuring
Imagine of Monty Oum was alive these genshin character demos would be 1000x better
Oh yes, Taylor 😍
As someone said, and I quote, she isn't Taylor Swift, she's a french Tom Cruise.
Dont worry Navia... Ill get you once i have my cloud retainer. But i will get you on the rerun no doubt😢
i need her so bad
Lynette ❤️
the music the everything IS AAMAAZZINGG THANK YOU FOR THIS AMAZING CHARACTER!!
CSI: Miami Genshin Edition Staring Navia as Horatio Caine (2:10)
Yall gave ayaka a gun
This is awesome but I feel like having more geo supports are more important than dps characters right now
Navia made america great again.
Navia: wake up cowboy there's a prison to burn you in.
girl's got style, also why was her gacha weapon an axe instead of her umbrella?
light of my life
I just want a navia please of genshin impact i need her and her weapon or else my life is incomplete😢
OMGOMG SHE HAS A GUN AHSHASHASHSFAS
This one is so good, it feels like a movie trailer
Ako at ang mga kakalase ko nag hahabulan pag lunch be like:
Plot twist _"🍑 that is all, I'm foolish"🥹
i love that she completely encompasses the meaning of "girl boss", always with her umbrella in hand and not one ungraceful movement yet merciless in battle
Winning my 50:50 on her banner. Soo happy
Navia: oh sheee that thief got a hela boat 🤣  Lynette: No worries I got your back Homie😂
If only we can use her ☂️ to glid.😭😭
she reminds me of princess peach a little bit
abolish the police
1:28 - 1:50 man I love that build up and the sirens in the back make it so hyped!
Got her. I lost on 50/50 but got her on 2nd run. She now sits at L90 with 8/8/8 talents. Also managed to get her weapon after losing on the first run. Then the next 10-roll turned out to have a 5* and got it. All that's left is to farm for the new artifacts and weapon materials. Now sitting at 150+ Intertwined left and am going to save up for possible Cloud Retainer. Woo, gonna  be fun once I get her built up.
taylor swift fights back
so gonna get heeer!
I wanna be Chlorinde so BAAAAAD
When i heard the first note i thought it was the better call saul theme 😭
NAVIA AND LYNETTE IS SO CUTEEE!
Design: Fire Kit: Fire VA: Baby???
Bos barbar mah ini
Genshin i have never won a 50 50 am i bugged
I lost my 50 50 to jean not even tignari while pulling for her
Navia WILL get a rerun right?? I still don't have enough wishes saved up
She's a true Kingsman 😂
FAYAAAAA!!!
im broke after getting Furina and her signature
THE QUEEN HAS ARRIVED PEOPLE! YES, *THAT'S* HAPPENING.
Millions of dollars, and we have a trailer full of 95% clone models. We are being robbed.
I swear to god she looks like Swire's swimsuit variation
1:54
That opening setting and break was damn great, giving a slightly carefree tone to this without delving into pure comedy.  Within 10 seconds we are given the tone, and it jives perfectly well and is conistent throughout the demo.  Via: Starts off with a slightly serious feeling, immediately breaks it with the dude who was literally just introduced as a really slick dude just walks right in front of them to this sudden silence lxD Then with little lighthearted bits throughout the remainder of the demo through the various characters actions made a unique tone that sets this demo apart from the others in an interesting niche.    I'm really blown away at how much contrast in tone there is between all the characters and how they are presented in their demos throughout Genshin's ...geeze 3 year history now.  From Klee's trailer to present, they have all been atleast freakin' great ahnd all carry a unique feeling to them that complements the characters they are presenting.  Incredible job Mihoyoverse, thanks for making this incredible game l:,)
The part where his companions hold her umbrella and said "Please Boss, put your umbrella away killed me" killed me
Proud future navia main
omg her CLAYMORE i absolutely need it 🙏🙏🙏🙏
This looks so cool! The transitions were so smooth! And the music is awesome! 😊
shes supposed to be pneuma, how is her color matching with ousia lol
She takes Kingsman code by heart. A Queenswoman if you will
2:11 "Hi, I’m Saul Goodman. Did you know that you have rights? The Constitution says you do. And so do I. I believe that until proven guilty, every man, woman, and child in this country is innocent. And that’s why I fight for you, Albuquerque!"
NAVIA PLS COME HOME (I deleted 31gb of my fav series BSD just to play genshin again🥲❤️‍🔥)
1:05 Bro they made the MMD Specialist Dance even before the fans ain't no way
Once a wise person said, "A girl who looks good in glasses must be treasured"
you go gurl!!
Enjoy ur 4 Star Selector during lantern rite while we get 5 Star Selector during HSR 1st anniversary 🔥
Keep whalling on new characters because you never getting a free 5 star like HSR 😂
“A proper send-off!” Navia…
alright gangplank, cant wait for that barrel and orange.
Is it just me, or does her voice seem higher pitched in this and her teaser than it did in-game?
with style 🤣
NEW GEO CHARACTER AFTER ALMOST 2YRS
I love Navia's trailer. Good luck to those pulling for her!
You won't get her as free 5 star we have Dr. RATIO for free in HSR 🙊
She's such a ray of sunshine! Good luck to everyone pulling for her!
She's so cool and pretty!
Girl use unbrella in right way!!  Edit: notice lynatte help her so adorable!
문열어!
With Furina as my witness!  That man is dead!  Navia is pure chaos energy wrapped into a cinnamon roll.
Nice👍
So excited for her
🤩🤩🤩
The storage needed in mobile version is getting crazier and crazier.  Every update is 3 GB. Later when my storage is full, i think it is time to stop playing genshin
Lynette just like : “Girl. ☝🏻”
This is cegil🤏😎
the batman of fontaine
NAVIA WORE HEELS CHASING THAT MAN???
imagine she used her umbrella instead of the wings to glide :000
7 wishes and a dream. 🫡🫡🫡😞😞
Me fui del Genshin en 2020 y que coño es esto que clase de arma es esa primero pensé que era espada y después la vaina empezó a disparar WTF? ._.?
I feel like navia and beidou would be good friends
Это лучший трейлер персонажа, который я смотрела.  Но.. КАК ОНА НОСИТСЯ НА КАБЛУКАХ, ПРИ ЭТОМ СРАЖАЯСЬ ДВУРУЧНЫМ?
Navia is such a good character, arguably underrated and nearly as good as Furina during the archon quests.
I lost the 50/50 on the ayato banner failing to reunity the brother with the sister. Now hoping ill get navia before 2nd half of update 😂
AAAA I LOVE the bass in her song <3
Im genuinely tweaking waiting for her bro pleasde time go FASDTER
DAMN and she did all that in heels
TAYLOR SWIFT??
I see that umbrella. ok penguin
NAVIA VENDRÁ A CASA
SHE'S SO GIRLBOSS 🫣
she's genuinely the best character wtf
OMG OMG WTF WTF I DIDNT GET THIS AHHHH IM GONNA KMS
wo kao yuan😂
BRAVO ELEGANTOOO~!!!  His Mafia Father would be so proud!!! HAHAHA
Piper from brawl stars? 😮😂  (just kidding)
this is THE BEST character demo yet.
I’m going broke
0:31 that was cold
Navia my mother ❤️❤️❤️
Ain't this a bit extra
1:09 splatoon undercover brella??!
after seeing the 2D-preview, I do hope that they did not change her voice direction to be more high-pitched, but it does sound like it's the case in this trailer as well...
2:01 bomb this bomb that bomb it all
This might be the best one out of the rest
QUE ELA SEJA MINHA T5 GRATIS
That's Clitopho escaped from the Chasm.
Cool girls don't look at explosions
OMG perfect trailer for her
Saul Goodman is that you? 0:00
Lynette helped Navia!!
GOLDEN TROUPES!
this demo was fun, sadly ill have to skip Navia for the 4.4 characters but will definitely get her on a rerun
Ahhh yes... A French Mafia with a chaotic Demo 👌
Muito legal, só que ainda tô juntando pra 4.4, nós pensa pro futuro
I LOVE HERRRR
Genshins animation is only geyting better and better the facial expressions and body movements absolutely blew me away
they went crazy on this character demo
i got the guarantee on this banner, i dont care im still before inazuma in story, I think shes worth pulling!
Damn i was gonna skip her because shes geo but damn this makes me wanna get her now
ABSLUTE ICON!
THE WESTERN MUSIC AT THE BEGINING IS KILLIG  ME DUDE
She’s the prettiest Genshin character I’ve ever seen 🥰✨✨
eh i can make a game better than this if i really put my mind to it
I wanted her already, but now i want her even more!
So iconic! She's so iconic!!
Navia without Melus and Silver just aint the same
Ngl Navias Ult makes the meatball look tad bit tame
this was most def one of the best demos
Good character + a funny chase
Did they change her VA? This isn't the same sound as Navia from the archon quest
🕯🕯NAVIA ESTÁ EN CASA🕯🕯
😍 I like it 😍 amazing trailer and character 😍
Unofficial? But it showing on official. Make no sense.
OMG BEAUTIFUL. the silly and movie-like energy is so wholesome and awesome💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯 AND the large association with the npcs and more wonderful animation is just amazing!
YESSSSSJAHSH
This totally convinced me to pull for her! She is gorgeous
I don't have ayaka, who do I pull for 😢
oh my gosh, navia is so pretty
why is she ousia????? she's totally pneuma and her boss is the pneuma spare key
I want. Navia sooooo bad when she comes out
I'm loving the recent comedic demos
Okay BUT CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE MUSIC THOUGH LIKE ALL FONTAINE CHARACTER DEMO’S MUSIC IS SO GOOD
:0
lynnete was everything 🖤
Well time to lose 50:50 to Qiqi.   I pulled a Qiqi I pulled a Qiqi I pulled a Qiqi I'm not feeling Very good  I pulled a Qiqi Lost fifty-fifty At 90 pity, not even Keqing And now I'm out Of primogems
If navia's ult doesn't include "Adieu!" I'm never pulling
Navia’s smile during her burst at 1:55 for some reason reminds me of Yangs smile from RWBY back in volumes 1-3 when it was still the Poser Pro animation
genshin give me her pls☹️
Absolutely stunning and utterly hilarious. lololol  I LOVE IT
this demo is so silly and cool !! navia is just ssosoo pretty and her new bodyguards are hilarious
Navia is swag
SHE WILL COME HOME
When 3 banner
definitivamente Navia vendra a casa
I need me that music
She’s so cute
okay but why the thief kinda....
Man…Navia girl can run in some heels 👠 👢 she was running along the walls and everything!
Que tema é esse, Brasil?  Não tava nem aí pra personagem, mas essa musiquinha foi do balacobaco
It kinda reminds me of the trailer for Aalto from Wuthering Waves.
YOO THIS IS SO AMAZING
ALRIGHT! I’ll pull for Navia
No, he goes straight to the guards. No doctor! He obviously doesn’t deserve it!
I love her 👀👀👀…she reminds me of Yang from RWBY💀
SHE'S A LEGEND, SHE'S AN ICON, AND SHE IS THE MOMENT. COME ON NOW
when navia thirsts for blood
I thought they are going to play the saul good man sound at 2:12 lmao
Maybe on the rerun, I need my Raiden
if only she shouted tiro finale
2:12 why did i think the intro to better call saul was about to start playing 🤣
TAYLOR SWIFT!
She's so cool
GODDDDDDDDDD I LOVE HER SO MUCH
Is this Kafka 2.0?
She is so cool
crying because melus and silver could've been by her side in this demo 😔
2:16 wake the f- up, traveler.
DAAAYYMNN
Y’all still playing this game?😮
for all the people who will wish on the Navia's banner, I wish you all good luck!    By the way, wish me good luck too I'm at 50/50 with 63 pity 😅
I just wish she was a good element, she looks so badass
The thief guy is absolutely goated. He escaped through the sewers while being pursued, literally ran around every square metre of the city, got attacked in the city, somehow escaped and ended up in the outskirts of the city across the lake, fought with Navia (a vision wielder) who shot him with a gun which he survived, then he ended up back in the city (teleportation through a smoke bomb in open daylight???), grabbed an airship and probably piloted it by himself, got onto a boat at one point, then finally survived being blown up by Navia. Strongest character in Genshin Impact.
If only she used her umbrella while gliding  🥲
I LOVE YOU NAVIA
Nobody: Lynette: ☕😐☝
1:57  Navia Bonaparte
it's phantom solitaire , that guy...
Is this the same VA? Not that I would care if they did change, she just sounds different to me.
OMAIGOSH I LOVE HER
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🦅🦅🦅
God I want her but I’m BROKE
Now this. This feels like a real Fontaine character alright.
I guess our characters are getting guns...oooooooooooooooooooah!
Genshin's demos are getting better and better 😍😆
QUEEN NAVIA WITH THE BEST CHARACTER DEMO
The graphics, sound, cut scenes and characters are so amazing, nice video, Hoyoverse!
THIS MADE ME FEEL SO MANY THINGS
I have nothing to say  other that I love her! <3
this is the best subway surfers ad i’ve seem
Navia is truly the Geo Queen, she possesses an axe, cannons, AND an umbrella with a gun inside?!? I’m sold.
Omg I just absolutely love every part of her character I can't wait to permanently add her to my team✊🏾
how can she run with such thin heels?!
We will never forget Melus and Silver though
Imagine if Navia competed with Beep Beep
Sounds like the song “Kabhi na kahena alvida”
Strange how geo is the slowest loading element and yet Navia is here running faster than light
navia is my boss
NAVIA SLAYS SO HARD
I don't know, I don't like this change in intonation and timbre of Brenna Larsen's voice. She began to sound more like a Collei in some places than the last slightly low delicious voice with a hoarseness and a little accent 🤔
С первых секунд идёт вайб е лань
шизафрения) с каждым днем становитесь лучше и лучше!
One of the best Mary Poppins I've ever seen...well right next to the original at least
So considerate of Navia to bring him outside the city just to beat the life outta him
Wait does she have the badass shades during her ult?
NOBODY IS TALKING ABT THE MUSIC?? IT HAS FLAMENCO NOTES HELLO????
shes so beautiful, and this might be THE BEST if not character Demo!! :D
If they dont revive Melus and Silver I'm gonna be sad af.
🕺 0:21
ok but THESE DEMOS ARE GETTING BETTER AND BETTER AHHHHH I WANT HER TO COME HOMEEE
Charlotte at 0:46 haha
THE DEFINITION OF ELEGANCE, GRACE, AND PRECISION
Best Girl!!!!! ❤❤❤
I LOVE HAPPY NAVIA
OK so after 1 year I may return to Genshin....
2:22 Welt, is you!?
2:10 Klee approves.
Nobody Navia- 😎
0:33 Checkmate.
0:21 It's joever.
i want to be the ground she walks on
Is this a clone of Tomoe Mami?
That wasn't a thief arrest, that was downright an execution 💀
Videos like this make me wait for the Genshin anime even more.
made me smile multiple times ngl. she's such a pure girl boss.
AH, VDD..JA ATUALIZOU.
They did mafia clean
did my boy Keaya dirty big time
LYNETTE MENTION LYNETTE SCREENTIME
Navia bringing Geo back. ❤
Navia i love ya~
The archon of Taylor Swift
HYPE DEMOOOOOOO!!!
1:29
Navia es peronista
Что делать если: Я всё обновила место на телефоне есть но когда я пытаюсь зайти на основной акаунт он не заходится и загрузка где конец гео оно то до конца то опять менше и жоско лагает. Но на других акаунтах всё заходится + я смотрю со 2 акаунта когда я в последнее время была в игре и мне показывает сегодня (хотя я только сегодня пыталась зайти но не зашлось) 😢
Mi novia we
WOOOOO SHE'S FINALLY HERE!!!
I DARE YOU HOYO TO MAKE HER GLIDE WITH THE UMBRELLA INSTEAD OF WINGS
I stan
amo la banda sonora
SGES SO COOL OMG MY FAV GEO CHARACTER I LOVE HER SO MUCH LIKE WTF AND OMG SHES SO PRETTY AHHH WHAT A GOOD DAY TO LOVE WOMEN
Navia’s trailer might be my favorite, it’s animated so well, Fontaine fits a title like the nation of Theatrics.
Navia kinda lame
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Let me also remind you all she is doing this in heels. She’s FABULOUS
Best demo for me
Que tráiler tan divertido, la persecución es tan cómica y un final genial (me recuerda un poco a las pelis de mafia Italiana x"D) épico
You can't tell me, Mihoyo doesn't have the coolest character demos
I love Navia sm but her childishness just ruins it. I don’t know if it’s that bad or if I’m just making up things but I really don’t like that about her.
She will look so good on my team😈
أنها ملاك الحرمة نافيا❤
forget raiden ima pull for taylor swift
Mihoyo really is outdoing themselves with these past character presentation! my good
Es como una combinación de Mami Tomoe con Taylor Swift, me encanta 🥰
Im def gonna use all my wishes for her
I'm not wishing for her, but I'm excited to see Navia mains in my world.
She almost did a Singing in the rain moment. But this time, the Hydro dragon isn't crying.
OMG THIS IS SO GOOD
Totally has Kingsman vibes with that weaponized umbrella
Love how Lynette was just there for a moment so cute
Love how it starts off as "How are we going to find this guy!?"  He's over there and they look at him instantly lol
I love you navia pls come home ❤😢
Navia is the swag Mosiah
That moment you notice that Melus and Silver isn't there.
THEY WENT ALL OUT WTIH THIS ONE THE QUALIKTY KEEPS GETTING HIGHER AND HIGHER WE EVEN GOT AN CHASING ANIMATION SEQUENCE OMGG!!1
so where is chevreuse demo
Subway Surfers be like 😂
Wow❤
Libera a música dessa demo por favor
ahahhahaah i love HER PLEASE !!
its nice to know how melus and silver's death is no longer too much of a burden. A tragedy it was, but one can not dwell on the past for too long.
So like… are the cannons in her burst Geo constructs? Or are they literal cannons that I like to imagine her people drag along with her.
WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Vem navia vem vem
This one was amazing🎉🎉
i love her so much
Navia in trailer: 😃😄😁😆🙃😊🥰😇😋 Navia in quest: 😳🥺😧😦😨😰😥😢😭
I have to uninstall genshin. That game will ruin my life.
Нехило она на шпильках бегает 😂
The Geo savior is here. God bless Navia
tony stark of genshin impact
Que gran manera de presentar un personaje,así dan ganas de gastar todos los ahorros😅
NOOOO WHYD THEY MAKE HER SOUND SO HIGH PITCHED.
I'm not saying that her current two bodyguards are not good or sth, but it would have been nice to see Melus and Silver in her character demo too.
Wowwww quedo increible el demo 💛💎💛💎 mas razones para tirar por ella 😍😍😍
Navia mains:😎☂️
Her VA has changed, and its not because her voice sounded different while crying. Same think they did to barbara, despite she aint popular, her first VA actually had some personality. Hopefully she aint completely useless cuz she looks badass, otherwise gotta spend the gems on reruns
Is booba sword will come with her???
My queen able to chase after this guy in heels ☕️😎
Best demo?
Just do this freaken update
Aaww! Lynette so cute🤧
She's very agile for someone who wears high heels lol
Крутые женщины не смотрят на взрывы:
"please boss, put your umbrella away!" Has me rolling! 🤣🤣
Вот это синематик что надо 🎉👍👏
Captain Navia of m/s Rosula
Has Navia's voice changed????
Cowboy Western...
No but that Ship chase scene was insaneee.
Yoo imagine she had a unique glider animation with her parasol?
Actual banger of a trailer well done team.
How fast and durable is this one Treasure Hoarder throughout this trailer?
Es increíble y bonita😭❤
OK MABEY ILL PULL OK MABEY ILL PULL HER
anyone else noticed how high pitched her voice is here? i just hope that theres a lore reason for this change because i really liked her voice in the AQ
I don't care if Hoyo somehow makes her kit useless or not meta, I'm still building her out of respect
Lynette spawn by herself
I don't really like the mechanical modern effect of her burst.
And cloud retainer coming otu ... noes my money
кайф
I love my wifey
SHE ATE SHE ATE 😂😂
All I’m gonna say.  If she doesn’t glide with her umbrella, then it was a missed opportunity
Navia swift looks beutiful on her demo✨️
SHE IS SO BEAUTIFUL
RWBY coded
Navia and Furina having some of the best demos in genshin impact hands down
linda perfeita maravilhosa diva fabulosa incrível a melhor
Why is nobody talking about how Lynette is in almost every single fontain character trailer
blud has a gun
That little moment in 0:20 of a deer in a headlights reminds me so much of cafeteria scene from Hi-Fi Rush :D
Navia is Mary Poppins and Ashley Taylor combined
The trailer for the new kingsman movie is looking LIT 🔥 👀👀👀/j
This is the best demo ever
Minha nova demo favorita
SHE IS GORGEOUS, TEH ANIMATION LOOKS CRAZY
wake the F*** Up Traveler, we have a city to burn
Navia í a little copy of Mary poppins and poly in brawl stars...
SAVING FOR NAVIA!!! IN EARLY PITY PLEASE!!!❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
Took 2mins to beat a single water bottle chucking treasure hoarder 😢      /jk This was a bait lol. I like the shades
2:12 bcs main theme…
I think this is the best character introduction so far ❤
Very nicely done
Charlotte at 0:46 is you look closely
Melus and Silver 💔💔💔
she is so beautiful, I'm definitely pulling on her banner, idc about meta
The way that she actually slayed 😍
She ain’t gotta do allat for one guy, especially not the gun
And she did it all in heels.
1:29 okay that's a great change of music tempo
I NEED HER.
Not me crying for accidentaly got cyno when I go for kirara... 😭 I want navia so bad nowwww 😭
They went all out on the animation on this one. Definitely going to wish for her
the fact i was considering getting C2 raiden BEFORE this banger dropped
Perfect!
It must be so horrifying to run past your pursuer only for her to laugh, strike a pose then start wall running at the speed of light at you 😭
Господи, ее фото в очках на фоне взрыва это просто 🛐🛐🛐🛐
SHES TOO BEAUTIFUL!!!!
She's an icon, a legend and she is the moment
DESDE CUANDO LOS DEMOS SE HICIERON TAN BUENOS??!?!
God i love lynette
she so cool
TUTTI QUESTI PIEDI IN PRIMO PIANOOOO
2:12 Reference 🗿
By all accounts bro's skull should be gone
So precious
Navia con la percepción de la realidad completamente alterada: 😎
Aye, I yield Miss Navia. Me primogems are all yers.
Whyd this remind me of top gun? No idea.
"We're still on the hunt for 'The Sea Shadow', so if you ever see someone that looks like generic character model #3544 with a bandana on his mouth, let us know."
She‘s so elegant ❤
I need her glider to be her umbrella/parasol 😭😭😭
That's right, Navia. Beat the love of Geo into him!
SHE IS SO ICONIC
Did you know that there is no guns control in Fontaine ? 😊
she's so fabulous hahaha
my gosh, she's so Mafia Mommy
Navia va a anular el daño por caída con su paragua ?, si no no te la compro
WHAAAAT OMG NAVIA QUEEN IS SLAYIIING
I will do anything, even a crime, just to get chased by Navia.
OBS: *No Sea Shadows were hurt on the making of this video.
I was planning on skipping but after this demo...I've made up my mind
THAT LYNETTE SCENE IS SO CUTEEE
Another klee
I love her design, but I don't like the idea of a Geo unit that doesn't synergize with other Geo units. And why is it always the worst possible weapon choice, the claymore (((
She is always gorgeous.
her demo is… ok.
Con game nào đó được free 5 sao còn con game ghẻ này thì không. Michos quả là bào
Te amo Navia ❤❤❤
why all fontaine demos are crazy
12 hours early
This is one of my favorite character demos why? 1.Navia 2.The npcs facial expressions 3.The animation 4.Chaos 5.Music
This is very good,Navia is so beautiful and perfect 😭😭
why does her voice sound so different from the archon quest?
Navia eres increíble ¡TQM!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤️❤️🥳🥳🥳😍😍😘🥰😍🤩
i almost cried
《Assasin creed：The Geo princess》 Navia the Reginae Lapis😂 （PS：ZhongLi is Rex Lapis）
Im sorry...  "He's unpredicatable too-" was he waltzes into the meeting-  Well I guess being stupid is also unpredictable
Charlotte is in the trailer too
Wearing heel 👠 and running so fast 😂😅
NOO I SHOULDN-T HAVE WATCH THIS I'M SAVING UP FOR RAIDEN😭
All the transitions are actually so clean the editor needs a raise
Just don´t make a video of her falling down the stairs with her umbrella please
wait... she use an umbrella/axe? Navia: its also a gun  like if u get the reference 🤣
crazy she's doing that chase while on heels, in a dress while carrying a giant axe and modified umbrella gun.
i need dat umbrella
I'm not pulling Navia for her kit, I'm pulling her because of COPIUM
Su voz no es diferente??😅
I thought I was ready for Navia, but then Xianyun leak, and now this comes out. What should I choose ? Or should I open my wallet ?
HOW DID SHE DO IT ALL JUMPING AND THINGS WITH HEELS?!?
did they change her voice actor? 🥺
She reminds me of neyo from rwby.
So COOL!!!! I really loved it 😍🤩
I avoided most of spoilers of her mechanics til today, i dont realle care if she is not meta I pull for her. I five a buck about Cloud preserver, Clorinde or Arlecino tbh
ONE OF THE BEST DEMOS I'VE SEEN  NAVIA GIRLBOSS
She be 😎
Thsi has nothing to do with anything but ai keeps thing Neuvillette is a female buts HES A MALE
LYNETTE!!!!!SHE IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO CUTE!!!!!!!i cant control my beating heart for hear🤤
It's fischl's sister from Fontaine 🤨
I like her style. It is a mix of classic fancy, and modern cool at the same time.
Princess peach and daisy fusion, I love it‼️
That's my queen right there 🫡
Que sombrilla más buena para soportar ese viento
I’m waiting, I need this so much.
i definitely gonna pull her
The way I could almost hear the "heh, another test subject" when they showed the wanted poster
look like someone better call saul
Navia: In a high-speed chase Also Navia: Looking elegant as hell at all times
Those sunglasses looks so cool
что вы употребляете,михое
i wish when if you glide with her, she pulls out her umbrella instead of the wind glider
Gastronomy. Great times. Girlboss.
another hot claymoregenshin girl, another sweet sweet guitar rift.... thank you geo eula (music anyway)
take note, she did this IN HEELS
Navia is such a good character, arguably underrated and nearly as good as Furina during the archon quests.
Ah yes my favorite Genshin character, Mary Poppins
Fontaine music slaps hard
The thief: man im dead
Lynette: 👆
such a pretty demo
Ready for tomorrow hoping to get Navia at early pity🥰
I got tired of watching her run this much. Girl's got spirit alright!
Not the Nanny McPhee umbrella being a gun and a boat sail 💀
Cool.
2:12 Saul Goodman Theme?
1:41 If only boats actually went that fast in the actual game
"Boss. We've a lead on that thief. Unfortunately, he looks like any other NPC which is how he has eluded us thus far."
Is her voice lighter? She sounds cute
TALK ABOUT GIRL BOSS HIGH DEF
the poor guy-
🤣🤣🤣уберите зонтик плиз😂😂😂милашка
Is she gonna be able to have a special glider by using her umbrella pls GENSHIN🙏
That's a pretty good demo
The way she acts like a mafia boss with the glasses 😭
She hit him so hard, he teleported outside to get beat up
One of the best characters overall from the archon quests and her demo doesn’t miss  Can’t wait to add her to the team tonight 😊
I L O V E her  Oh my god
AMERICAN CHARACTER🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🦅🦅
This trailer is such a cinematic masterpiece! Genshin's demo videos just gets better every time!
Why is Navia beating up a guy who clearly doesn't know how to fight since he's running away? That's definitely assault in America.
I’m on 50/50, please make me win hoyo
Zhongli is dad. No one can replace him. Period.
The glasses... Wait! Rawfler?! @rawfler did this video too? 😂😂😂😂
2:11 Hey you, you're finally awake
ПХАХАХАХАХАХАХАХА Я ПОРЖАЛА СПАСИБО
Her umbrella is even animated, oh my
The music is in point. Mavis with Umbrella and sunglasses looks fabulous as always, Lynette helping quietly. Everything is on point!
love Navia
💘💘💛💛💘💘💛💛💘💘💛💛💘💘💛💛💘💘💛💛
Love how she just pull cannons out of nowhere
If you can't glide using her parasol I'm going to be very disappoint
Finally I found use for all the elemental crystals zhongli's piller making between fights
2:16 BEST POV EVER
Step 1 of how to be a lady: Attack someone with a Bazooka
SO SMOOTH OMG
Best character
This the best demo ever
geo dad zhongli's pride and joy
Bro, she has a bomb, a axe, a umbralla and your mom
navia vc eh uma mãe para muitos
ЧТО ЭТО?!?!?! КАКОГО ЧЁРТА ТАК КРАСИВО?!?!??!
DID SHE REALLY HIT A THIEF WITH A FREAKING BATTLE AXE!?
I wish her exploration passive was, instead of using the wing glider, she’ll just float down like mary poppins with her umbrella.
Navia❤
I think this is the funniest demo I’ve seen
TAYLOR SWIFT!!!!
CLAIM NAVIAA
Does someone know if she’ll be on the standard banner ?
Navi’s gives “if you gonna do something, do it in style🤩” vibes
I didn't know Taylor swift is already a gacha character.
Omg her theme is so good
It's the coolest trailer ever!!!
Ngl kinda prefer her usual voice than high pitched

the eras tour finally came to teyvat😍😍😍😍😍 #swiftie
I *love* her she’s brilliant
I can’t wait my wife to come home 🎉
I would have loved to see a 5star geo ningquang catalyst replacement. We already have a 5 star claymore geo character. Catalyst 5 star geo would have been nice for fighting the wolflord
BRO HE DIED ☠️
silver and melus would be so proud
No ones talking abt the glassess they look so swag on her omggggg 😎😎😎
MY PRIMOGEMS!!!🥲🤩🤩🤩
White woman save me
Is it just me or Navia here doesn’t sound like Navia at all? Is this even the same VA?
Esperava que con la ulti dijera "Por fontaine!" XD
*uses three giant naval cannons to erase a single gardemek*
we all pulled
Mommy
Man! I love every part of this demo.
SLAY NAVIA
the eras tour goes to fontaine
AAAAAA HER THEME SONG IS SUCH A BANGER ❤
This is too long to Match Zhonglis Intro but it still fits a few good parts
Deverian de poner un nuevo baner permanente en el gachapon que les permita a los jugadores más nuevos o casuales conseguir a cualquier personaje del juego
NAVIA THE ✨GIRL BOSS✨😭😩👌🏻
She’s basically a mobster I love it
😎
The want is real my primos are up to7000 for her
Will her umbrella replace the glider for her?
Navia is my favourite RWBY character!
she so frikin slay
She is the moment, she is an Icon, she is a LEGEND!
The transitions and the use of camera work is so beautiful with the animations.
That little moment with Lynette honestly makes the trailer for me. The music change is incredible
One of the best demos
the NPCs here have surprisingly more expressive facial expressions than normal
Meh 5/10
she is so cute
False advertising. Only Star Rail got infinity sprint stamina.
Beautiful!! I'm so excited for her!!!!!!! 💛🧡
Why does she sound like a child wth happend
She literal perfection
Definitely gonna pull her, wish us luck : )
It's the best 😭😭
I really liked this demo a lot!
PRETTY OML
So excited for her character trial because i am saving up for furina !
Next : Scythe-Rifle, Rapier-Revolver, Katana-Pistol, Guantlet-Shotgun, Javeline-Rifle, Hammer-Rifle, Sickle-Pistol, Club-Bazooka, Trident-Rifle, Nunchaku-Shotgun, Scyte-Sword-Shotgun
I SHOULDN'T HAVE WASTED MY 38K ON CYNO😭😭 NAOOOOOO
Let her cook
i guess she was really FEARLESS doing that
It'd be cool if she used her umbrella instead of a glider to soar around 😊
*insert lego Bruce Wayne falling in love meme*
NGL the thief actually lasted pretty damn long for being against multiple named characters whilst being an unnamed rando.
YUOU'ERE HONOR I'M IN LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE
The amount of animation in this trailer is insane!
DEFINITELY PULLING FOR HER!1!1!1
I'm pretty sure most people missed Charlotte at around 0:45  Dude she's everywhere...
"It's also a gun."       -Ruby Rose
I LOVE HERR
Ok…this got me in the mood for her. In more ways than one. Also, does her umbrella change into her weapon and vice versa??? That’s flippin cool
Man..
Я до сих пор скучаю по Сильвестру и Мелусу. За время в Фонтейне я стал считать их моими любимыми персонажами, зачем их было убивать? (
We want Free 1 Free 5 Star Character Iike Star Rail As Representative Of Genshin Community We want Help Me Guys
Meh
😂la necesito definitivamente
2 bad she's geo, will have 2 pull 4 raiden
MY FAV TRAILER SO FARR THIS WAS SO FUNNY HWHAHHSA
OMG THIS IS AMAZING!!!! THE MUSIC, THE ANIMATION SND VA!!!! Also I love Lynette was included!!!! 😭❤️
The way they looked like when they were holding Navia's umbrella from flying to Inazuma 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀same goes with her too💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
😴
MY BEAUTY!!
2:16 Ship mocking the thief lol😂😂
Everything for cloud retainer 🗣️🗣️
She is simply... Gorgeous!
Navia is a GEO love letter 💌🙏
Navia's banner is beautiful ❤❤
Genshin rules of new character design: 1. Change colour palette to something different. 2. Add/remove cat ears/tails. 3. Add/remove hat. 4. Make flashy animation that essentially does the same thing as all the other characters.
Her attack animations are so pretty that I actually want to pull for her ❤
linda ela
I go online on genshin for 30 minutes everyday still, but havent completed sumeru 2 archon quest yet
AGHH HDGGSGSS NAVIA MY DARLING IM SO EXCITED THE WAY SHE DID ALL THAT AND STILL LOOKED SO FABUOLOUS
نافياا تحمستت😭😭
I cannot wait to see how the META treats Navia.
Bro the action is the best
Lynette:uses magic cutely
She's so girl boss I love it😭❤
I absolutely love the high energy in these fontaine character trailers.
People will Pull Her But Never Use her Geo Character are waste except Zhongli
She make her father proud
Navia = 😎 You = 🤓
La GIGAMILF DEL GEO.....meravigliosaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Sorry Yoimiya but Navia won my heart💛 She's incredibly gorgeous, love her backstory, her character design is the most beautiful out of all Genshin characters so far, her beautiful blue eyes, her make up, her weapon, gameplay just EVERYTHING!!!
AUE PERSONAGEM CHARMOSA, INCRÍVEL, LINDA LINDA
I will obviously pull for her haha
What a Woman 😍
Such a great trailer
A TRUE QWEEN!
Her personality is beautiful love it
Haters! why she has Haters?
Oh man, I love her more and more each second, can't wait to pull for Lady Navia
Why you keep picking the same 4 stars over and over for the banners, stop...
Girlboss Navis is on the scene!
Navia ❤❤❤🎉
Why the heck is Navia's voice so high-pitched?? It's so inconsistent from what we've been hearing of her all this time!
0:54 Loving that melody!!
okay i was not going to pull mut maybe..? demo is so amazing!!
It's very similar to the Italian mafia.
Taylor Swift is in the building
Pregunta soy el único que con cada actualización siento ganas de gastar todas mis protogemas para comprar a nuevos personajes tan geniales como navia, aunque en este caso fue neuvillete
2:12 Hi, I'm Navia Goodman. Did you know that you have rights? The constitution says you do! And so do I.
NAVIAAA
its cute
THE WAY SHE IS EFFORTLESSLY FLAWLESS
Boring character. Literally zero interest in her.
This is by far the best character trailer
Elegaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaant😍
absolute cinema
I'm going to pull for Navia, to have her and to honor Silver and Melus.
Humm not sure about her damage scaling all that skill stack and attack the treasure Horder is not dead
Let us never forget how Charlotte was able to get a pic of her during Navia chase
Navia stopping at nothing to chase you to the ends of the Earth whilst looking fabulous at the same time, what a woman!
Lynette: *tap tap* look up
That mf really thought he was subway surfers
this is so dramatic and camp. why do geo character are like this. i love them
pretty damn sure Navia is the dev's favorite in fontaine😂 i can feel their love and dedication with every little thing about her
Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, badass and a fuqing girlboss.
That's a one strong umbrella... where can I get one? 😁
I can feel all the meme editors grinning with these chasing scenes...
Very good 😊
do i hear prozd at the beginning
im definitely pulling for her, oh god.
Should I pull for Navia or Skip for Xianyun?😩😩this is hard
☘Navia vendra a casa ☘
NAVIA a True Police of Fontaine and it reminds me a lot of the situation in USA right now
Genshin: Fast and the Fabulous
El FBI esta aqui
Come on LADS! We pull er
time to check that Zhongli trailer as the contract states
Oh gosh I can't believe I am digging so much one of new demos! But after Zhongli's Listener I hardly could get into some demo (Baizhu and Neuvillette's Demos were exceptions too)! NAVIA ROCKS❤ can't wait to get her❤
mommy 😍
SHES SO CUTE AND SILLY AND GORGEOUS AND I LOVE HAA
Yeaaaah go Taylor Swift!!!
Navia's trailer is just her showing off her girlboss ways and I'm here for it
THESE DEMOS KEEP GETTING BETTER AND BETTER
Navia look exactly like Princess peach, Love it! i hope i got her though...
This might be in my top 5 demos The action shot in the city looks amazing
Charlotte taking another snapshot of Navia and crew chasing a thief through the city 😂
I'm supposed to be saving for Raiden Shogun, but Navia's so tempting to pull for..WAHH. But theres no way i'm waiting another year for Raiden's rerun. Navia is likely to rerun earlier. But my next savings go to Wriothesley. Eh, i will get Navia. Someday
2:12 sounds like Better Call Saul 😅
I got to wait into 2:00 pm so I just play tommorw 😭
OH MY GOOD.  😮😮😮😮❤❤❤❤❤❤😻😻😻😻MY WIFE
BRUH!! THE THEME SONG THO!!! If you don't have at least a sliver of thought in your head to dance to the song, we can't be buddies. xD
ELEGANTOOO!!!
THIS IS PERFECTT
For you all *GUN LANCE* main out there, congratulation you found your waifu
She probably destroyed half the nation just to catch him lol.
She's so fun! I've missed a character like her for a long time. Also, Geo supremacy, let's go!
I had decided to stop pulling in this game since I now play very casually... But I'm questioning myself now...
Should I pull navia or raiden pls help
Pls rng gods, for Christmas just give me Navia, that is all I ask
Oh she mothered I fear
gimme her plz, semoga menang rate off pity ijo 😔☝🏻
Would have been thousand times better if Melus and Silver were with her😢. No, I'm not saying RIP. They aren't dead after all
Bruh, her combat reminds me of Neo from RWBY
Chasing in heels?! That's a true girlboss
we need archon quests with this quality in the game
I really hope she has a unique gliding animation with her umbrella 😭
Hey hoyo community i am a traveler and genshin lover but for some reason a small file got deleted my pc and I can't run the game is asking me to download the whole game but i can't afford to download the game so i think i can't play the game wish i will play it again 😢❤
All I see is HoYo being Based with her
Arlecchino is who I'm intrested in.
I HOPE YALL GET NAVIAAAAAA
Version trailer music was so sick tho...
SPAM
Nice, but I really hope Navia has some speed running passive if most of her demo was about her running.
The whole ending I kept thinking about MK9 Stryker “Police brutality coming up!”
RIP MELUS AND SILVER😭😭😭😭
Navia is queen!! 👑
SHE IS SO CUTE!!!!!
Absolutely gorgeous! Navia looks amazing! I love how fluid she moves!  It looks like Navia has new bodyguards. Whether or not she has fully moved on from Melus and Silver, good for her! They will be missed. :'( What are their names... Youlus and Copper? ;D
AAAA TAYLOR SWIFTT
А теперь вспомним тизер Кейи
NAVIAAA YIPPEE
SHES SUCH A GIRLBOSS
and you're telling me that i dont wanna get her cuz shes geo? NO SHES GORGEOUS
Where can I buy that umbrella
Pls Xbox ×  Genshin pls
I love Navia so much and this trailer was a blast! Best of luck to everyone pulling for her I hope she comes home early!!!
Love this demo!  You go girl 😊🎉
Jesus loves you and died for you 🤍 so you can be set free and know Him personally 🤍 In Him is the fullness of fulfillment & eternal security
Whenever I see her,  I think she's a haughty tsundere, but whenever she opens her mouth,  she's just so polite, adorable and cool! I think I have a new main!
Like for Lynette in a Navia demo
Alright this was pretty funny and she's also pretty cute here.
Navia, you're mine!
AWWW!!! goodluck to all navia wanters, may you soon be navia HAVERS!!!!!
This is definitely one of the most fun character trailers they've ever made
oh my god I love her I will forfeit all mortal possessions to her
I've seen her somewhere, but where?
OMG I ADORE HER
Those who telling melus and silver are forgot.  But actually both silver and melus are in their PRIME FORMS now. See properly
dyva que inspira
She is beautiful and funny at the same time. I’ve got my Primogem ready. ☺️
good luck to everyone pulling for her!
Ugh she looks so fabulous but I'm sorry Navia, you'll have to wait until your rerun because some certain Retainer gameplay leaks looks insane
Navia my Beloved
queen...
She is so amazing 😭
IT'S PEAK
planning to get her, but xianyun drip..ugh
On to zhongli's demo
This trailer was so cute although I was really hoping her theme to be a little better
the queen's man in genshin
i like to imagine that those sunglasses are one of silver's (╥﹏╥)
Smashing! Really, MYH went above and beyond with this design!
her signature weapon looks so cool!!
for gods sake pls make her save geo element
We need that thief as Genshin's Character
She's free running and doing parkour with that heels, let that sink in
Melus and Silver will be proud to see her now... :') I can't wait to get our President of Spina de Rosula and  the best Queen!!
I insist that is a parasol...
Navia mi amor ire por ti
1:31 the way Lynette point with the spoon like that😂😂😂😂
Already ready to 3xcrown her.
This demo is Gorgeous & Wild at the same time 😭🔥🔥🔥😭
Elegant, noble, feminine, strong, fashion, kind, altruistic and lovely !!! -> Navia
Why not me
Stop tempting my wallet!
Is she just mary popping y'all ?
MARY POPPINS IS THAT YOU?
she really is a slay
2:12 better call saul
Na,wie lange wird Navia noch spielbar bleiben bis der nächste neue Charakter rauskommt? Sie sieht zwar ganz nett aus von Design her,aber so langsam wird es etwas zu viel mit neue Charakteren.:/
I love the way she is georgeous while chasing a criminal lol
She is the embodiment of Slay
Best character demo I've seen to date.
SHES SO BEAUTIFUL!
I think it will be the best Fontaine character’s trailer so far an the future ! So awesome rythmn and choregraphy (still waiting Clorinde’s one however)
Mother
This is amazing as always
This is legit too good
Revolution
So good
if only they made Navia plane with her umbrella instead of the wings
I never thought Navia would be that cool😭💖💖💖 She's so mesmerizing🥺💛💛
SO CUTE AND... FABULOUS!!! ELEGANT!!!
225 pulls saved. All Navia wanters shall become Navia havers.
Why is she Itto but with a corsé?
Chaotic! I like
Navia is so beautiful character!  Cute, strong and cool
PLEASE COME HOME TAYLOR SWIFT!
Meow
Man the music bangs!
Mannn why do you have to buy Navia and Yoimiya in the same update?
Hermosísima ❤
Keep your wallets ready
I wasn't planning on pulling for her but this trailer just did the trick. 60 pity and I have 20 pulls, let's see if I'll get her... Edit: I've won 50/50 and I got her!
my wife ♥️
She's wonderful, but I'm going to beat out Ayaka.
the ending is amazing um boss i think we need to get him to a docter first
Next time someone is holding an umbrella, run like hell
she is too gorgeous to be taylor swift. she is navia
I just love everything about her! The sunglasses too 🤧🔥
shes awesome but she uses crystallize💀
i got furina last  banner so there's no way im getting navia but  she looks amazing
Yelan: immediately takes down enemy Navia: *Fast and the Furious theme plays*
i dont need her...but shes so pretty
CSI MIAMI VIBES HELL YEAH
NAVIA NAVIA NAVIA NAVIA MUST COME HOME
yeeeeeeeeeeeees she is fabulous and this demo is so packed with action, I love it!
Clenardo papulin ❤❤
um she 's Geo right? I like it
2:11 Better call saul reference
Bruh "good nose" this thief just walked towards them LMAO.
Definitely pulling for her
This reminds me so much of Itto, what with her being a boss and her playful nature. Her claymore and geo attributes aswell as the need to look presentable are so similar to Itto. It's like she's a fancier version. I reckon they'd get along very well.
Damn
Based on the sketch, that thief could be anyone. Fortunately, he's got a good nose and can smell Navia's expensive premium perfume which lead him there.
She should've been y'all free 5 star but noooooo😂
The Genshin Impact Taylor Swift is back!
What a queen. She slayed it
Guapardo ❤
Her ultimate is a bunch of cannons? Wow!
Nah cuz Silver and Melus would’ve already catch the guy😭
Can any one help me with something...........    I was just playing Fontaine archon Quest finding the truth and I was middle of a conversation Bt I had to quit the game .....afterr that Now When I  try to login to my account and Srt with it it always crashing and Before that I am just able to here environmental sounds and the conversation bt still my game stuck on the elemental  loading logo

Por Melus e Silver a bela dama Navia virá para casa.
Шикарная! Надеюсь, что сильно повезёт и она вместе с Райден будут дома

I love Navia so much! She IS the moment!
Omg her trailer is like watching the best part of a movie 🍿
Too bad she is Geo...
NAVIA HAS GUNS?
caigo cada vez mas enamorado de Navia T.T
เพลงทำไมมันดูสู้เวอร์ชั่น ที่ไลท์แพท ไม่ได้เลยเวอร์ชั่นนั้นดูดีกว่าเยอะเลย
Navia @ 2:13 : "Ready to admit defeat? Let's get all your primos ❤"
genshin is becoming america simulator
This was such a fun demo!! Love the music especially.
She gives me so much peaches vibe from the super Mario movie, they would be such a great duo if they ever met each other
Simps be getting down down bad 💀
Navia, cannons are not instruments!
Im so hyped to pull for Navia😍Im luckly(or bit not luckly cause I lost my last 50/50 on furina banner)guarenteed, and then I pull on weapon banner as a current Ayaka Main who think about to main Navia I cant lose on that weapon banner currently Im on 40 pity with 27 pulls
Y’all better call her madam navia😡
0:45 everyone is minding their own business... Is this a regular occurrence in Fontaine?
Bro ...the demos that Catherine characters of Fontaine have are FIRE...or water...
her theme kinda sounds like flutter vs gesellschaft from Megaman Legends
best character demo ever
Yelan or Navia?
STOP HER DEMO IS SO GOOD i’m obsessed
DAMN! NAVIA'S QUICK ON HER TOES!
This is sooo goofy i’m in love
I wish mihoyo would let us glide Navia with her umbrella instead of the usual wind glider. 😆
Goddess. she is sooooooooo amazing i can't. just the best one qwq
SHE RELOADS HER UMBRELLA
the geo girlboss we needed
This might be the most unique animation in a character demo yet!
She was running on the wall in heels she is crazy 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I don't mind getting chased though
She looks amazing and her every move is so elegant!
Realmente muito bom
She is queen
sleeping 😪
I want to see a Navia and Itto interaction 😂
The princess peach of Genshin lol
what a boss 😎
When the french lady assumes the italian mafia.
Lynette appearance !!
Naaahhhh bro i thought it was melus on the right side 2:13😭😭
She will be the next KingsMan 😅
She must have really strong legs to be able to run this fast, her outfit is anything but aerodynamic
SHES SOO PERFECTT I LOVE HER SOO MUCHH
Hey genshin if i get navia can  use navia sell her things to get unlimited mora
ну, ну... Имея такую ловкость, она упала в первозданное море...
NAVIA IS COMING HOME!!
I LOVE HER SUNGLASSES!!!
Her voice sounds different
0:25  The most expresive face we will ever see an NPC do
geo characters be like:  Noelle: stronk maid Albedo: Elevate~ Itto: *C O W* Traveller: funny combo with zhongli Zhongli: Tengai Shinsei! Gorou: doggo Ninguang: Zhongli if he had money instead of power Yun Jin: earrape simulator  Navia: *ARTILLERY BARAGE!!!*
Smash
"Such Elegance"
Somebody: Navia seems a little weak  Hoyoverse: *Hold my wine*
I... Have.. to.. skip.. for.. Nahida.. or.. Sigewinne.. I must.. 😭
shes so over the top that at 0:53 she kenobi'd that guy 💀 "hey there!" (she had the high ground)
I really liked Navya's design at first, but after the storyline I was determined that I was going to get her. She captivated me with her sincerity, sense of justice, duty and devotion. She will not hide her disagreement before God, she will not hide her tears before the supreme judge. She is a wonderful character with a soul and I hope she ends up in my collection 💮
We don't xare about Navia ADD ENDGAME CONTENT
im gonna go broke for her arent i
she so quirky i love it~ *proceed to watch the demo 20 times*
Saul's theme for the first note
:D
02:12 yo mister white
Animation so good! Amazing!
shes so elegant guys help me
0:36 Imagine running away from someone and they just spin around and pose with an umbrella for 3 seconds and still being caught, Blud wasted a 3 second head start
She did not have to do all that😭🙏🔥
Absolute banger
Taylor Swift in her New Era
Navia e incrível ❤❤
Yeah that was as i expected 👀👌 1:37 😂
Her voice is so off-putting now...
her entourages .....
Navia is really genshin's kingsman😅
1:29 LYNETTEEE
Гео мама
Imagine we get a new wind glider and it’s an umbrella
Princess Peach? 🍑
PLEASE I LOVE HER SO SO MUCH
Oh, this is FUN!
Is it just me or has her voice became pitchier?
I like Navia's two large canons, also her burst is pretty alright
Is it just me or I feel like they changed navia voice actor when she fights-  or they made her go high pitch😭
Navia is Taylor swift you can't say otherwise
NAVIA!! OMG NAVIA!! THE FASHION QUEEN IS OUT YALL!!!!! WOOOOOOOOOO!!
Everyone in this region has such a fun trailer! Okay, def rolling for Navia. I already have the best artifacts for her!
I prefer sad Navia...
I’m purely watching the trailer of the new character, knowing that in HSR they will give free Ratio. 😢
My fav demo ever
это не просто трейлер ЭТО КИНОИСКУССТВО!!!
1 word to say she's so pretty
"Sea Shadow"... the irony... and Navia wields a halberd. I find it pretty new, but I've seen those weapons before.  And yeah... she over did it.
Idk how but you just made me want to get Navia genshin
Wait will she be able to use her umbrela instead of a windglider?
Now go back to Zhongli's demo for the contract
why is her voice squeakier here?
I like her❤🧡💛 I hope her theme will be in "The Stellar Moments no.4", because 3.8 did not introduced any new characters.
This is who i have been waiting for! Shes so fkn beautiful!! 😳💖🔥❤️‍🔥😍
I'm so glad Navia is such an upbeat character. I feel like durandal from honkai was always portrayed as an older, mature, and serious girl, but seeing her being bubbly and fun brings out her youthful side in genshin.
You can see Charlotte taking a picture of navia chasing the thief down at 0:46
I’m really really hoping that you can fly/travel with her umbrella; I wanna be Mary Poppins 😃
The arataki gang of Fontaine
Really? 7hrs and almost half a million views?
Did you guys find Charlotte in the trailer
We all want her. Some of us can’t and we just have to accept it? 😭😭
She's after those style points
DROP DEAD GORGEOUS-
ELEEEEEGANTO!
This trailer is so fun!
This demo is just funny and pretty gorgeous
Epic demo
Good luck to those pulling for her❤
Anyone got some new redeem codes for me?
The transitions!!
I wish she uses her umbrella for her plunge attack 😭😭😭
im going absolutely insane waiting for this banner
F A TA L I T Y
I am certain of one thing: I need her umbrella :)
I bet her story quest will be a fun one to play.
Navia be looking graceful stylish powerful and fabulous all at the same time😂😂
Navia's design reminds me of Violet Evergarden, which I believe is the most lavishly illustrated anime ever. She just looks gorgeous!
She's literally Taylor Swift's Fearless Album
Ela parece daqui
And cool
Aryan
Dios mio....TERMENDA DIOSA DEL OLIMPO, navia te amo mucho espero que me salgas en el banner próximamente de alguna otra forma 💕💕💕🌻
omfg this is soooo hilariouss♡ tehe best nd one of mah fav8s evaaa♡ arugatou hoyoverse nd this is chef kiss♡ miss uh melus n silver even tho navia has been thru a lot ....still she is shinin♡
Gas
tbh I don't like geo character except for Zhongli
I missed this and then I see like 20 edits of it 😭😭
She's wallrunning! Look, a pilot, now the odds are in our favour!
so unpredictable that he walked right in front of them :V
LMAO, Its Swire
Now das some S tier Unga Bunga 😂😂
Slay Taylor slay
WAKE UP HONEY, TAYLOR SWIFT IS HERE!!
Damn her trailer is fine like her.
HELP I LOVE HOW THEYRE HOLDING ONTO HER UMBRELLA FOR DEAR LIFE
The question is... Did she gliding using her umbrella in the gameplay?
Taylor Swift?!
The character demo development is really good! Every moment become so natural now. Keep up the good work, Hoyoverse!
I guess she is best boss
Talk about doing all that in high heels!?!?! You go queen!!
Is it just me or does her voice sound so disimilar from her voice in the archon quest. Idk maybe Im imagining things but it dont sound the same to me.
Она выйдет уже сегодня или завтра?
man this trailer had a better story arc of than the entirety of inazuma archon quests
why does she so sound so different and high pitched?
It should have been them 😞
I don't know 'bout you, but my pity's 22~~~ Everything's gonna be alright IF my guaranteed next is you~~~   Being f2p in 50/50 is suffering...
What is it with all these circus, carnival characters lately?
sorry Venti but this is the most entertaining trailer ever ever ever
The fact that she cadually brings out WW2 NUKES😱😱😱
……imma be honest, I kinda fell in love with Sea-shadows’s goofy self here . lol.
Navia ❤
How is she so fast in that dress she is wearing?  I can't wait to play Gunlance in Genshin.
Can pull, when?
Damn what a good demo video ...The multiple layers of the chase scene were very great.
2:12 "Better Call Saul" Theme reference!?
How da hell can she run so fast and jump so high even with full dress and hills?
2:11 better call saul confirmed canon
HOW WAS THIS ONLY TWO MINUTES THIS IS SOO GOODDD
She's, HER.
All hail a Geo Princess 🧎🧎🧎 Ningguang may be a Queen, but Navia is the best Ojousama 🙏
Navia is me playing stealth games doing chasing tailing and capturing missions without making it too obvious and also keeping the target conscious by the end as bonus achievement.
navia main soon
Good luck to me and everyone who will spin on her banner!
Everyone talking about how great navia and her guards are but can we talk about the epic level treasure hunter for a moment. Dudes a legend for that marathon run and not getting caught that first time he was beaten. Navia still great though.
SUPER PRINCESS NAVIA!
Hay
If I lose Navia 50, I’m quiting
Realmente un belleza de personaje
Ну імба
Although I don't like her wearing glasses, she's gorgeous ! Waifu supremacy !!!! Thanks, Hoyoverse !
Don't mess with the Corsica mafia boss !
SCREAMING RN  I WANT HER SO BAD
I'm sad they made her voice more high pitched :/
Every single waifu in this game is just perfect!!
She can look so pretty even fighting
My girl is sprinting in heals and ends u0 fine whilst i become breathless after a 100m jogg
This demo looks fresh. It feels like the demos are getting more and more cinematic. I love the comedic scenes too!!
1:39 THIS IS HILARIOUS! I'm starting to really look forward to Genshin character demos! And the music's really nice :) heheh
my condolences to the genshin artists who wants to draw because her design is so detailed and fabulous
Another “funny teaser” love her 😊
I'm wondering... When Ayaka sees Navia and furina all over Tabibito... Well furina at this point is just another Scaramouche, so... Just Navia then... Hehe~
Imagine if all the cutscenes were like this in game for all the stories and introductions instead of the characters doing default jesters over and over
They had to change her character 3 times to make her marketable 😭
If she doesn't use her umbrella instead of wings to glide I'm not gonna pull for her -who am I kidding, I'll pull for her anyway-
0:20 Man walked right into a lion's den lmaoooo
This is a fun trailer, Navia is worth it to pull. Good luck everyone!
I love how she's grinning when she's firing those cannons.
Navia the battleship girl
After Inazuma, they pretty much ran out of ideas for new characters, mostly are so boring and bland.
2:12 sounds familair 😂
STOP, I'm trying to get AYAKA! WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME???
Pretty good
She can outrun the fastest thief while running in high heels, wearing a Cinderella dress, and carrying an umbrella it's "power Girl" yah
I love you Taylor
This was flimed pre flood XDDDDDDD 💀X2
Full skip🤑🤑
Bring back her old voice
0:37  What an incredible smile!
Отличный ролик! ❤ Навия топ 😎👆
This ain't a demo, this is a freakin movie at this point. Massive props to everyone who contributed to this demo, it was amazing and an absolute blast (hehe get it?) to watch :D
THE GEO QUEEN WILL BE OURS!!   also she slid down the walls more quicker than childe could surf down a waterfall in his demo
Look at my precious baby....She has grown so much!!🥺🥺🥺 Can't wait to pull for her!❤❤
One of the best trailers so far! I need her in my life
im laughing so hard about the little scene with lynnete xD
I better pull her later istg
The demos really keeps improving, each one its unique style and humour, please keep going and do the same with the 4.4 new characters!
Imagine Navia being on the standard banner after version 4.3 😆
This goes #2 in my personal demo rankings, #1 goes to Hu Tao. 😂😂😂
It's kinda sad when the best part of the demo doesn't involve the actual character the demo is made for. That Lynette is pure comical highlight of the entire thing. The music is quite mediocre as well
I just hope her high pitch voice is only in the trailers. Its really noticeable.
สวยและรวยมาก
this demo really wants me to pull for navia and make a amv about her OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Is the end of Genshin Impact?
Genshin animation has come a long wag
Lynette in this was such a pleasant surprise!!
She seems great but I’m saving for clorind
Very different from other character trailers from before, seeing Fontain chars has a different style in their trailer is a good and new wind breathe to me
NAVIA MY ABSOLUTE QUEEN 💛💛💛 TOMORROW YOU WILL COME HOME 😭😭😭
much better to see in english ver than korean I love it
Barbie Impact ♥
Wait a minute, did she literally just stepped on him? Man that shouldve been ME!
Teasers have come a long way . Regardless if you pull for a character or not these are amazing
I hope getting you tomorrow
Is anyone not gonna talk how his two assistants resembles melus and silver's attire
really really like make the movie Hollywood now <3
SERVING QUEEN
"A PROPER SENDOFF" WHY WAS THAT TRANSITION SO SMOOTH THOUGH
Amazing 😂🤩
I WANT GENSHIN TO MAKE A MOVIEEEEEE!!!!!!!
If we could go this fast in game we wouldnt even need teleportation points.
Navia swift is an icon😍 1:38
2:11 Saul Goodman
Every time I leave genshin, genshin gets me back
J'avoir Navia (manifestation)
GO TAYLOR!!! GO TAYLOR!!!! GO TAYLOR!!!! GO TAYLOR!!! GO TAYLOR!!! GO TAYLOR!!!!!
Is it just me or does navia's theme has that alhaitham theme mixed into it
She's perfect... I'm so in love ❤
I don't have Primos but i want her so bad! Sadly im at 0 pity
this is now my favorite demo trailer - I CAN'T WAIT!!! GL everyone wishing for Navia!
Wow, all that for 1 thief
ELEGANTO... VERY ELEGANTO ELE LE LE LE LE LE ELEGANSEEEE............
And she did allat WITH HEELS also the animation is absolutely gorgeous, just like Navia :D
My vieja we 😌❤️
The poor guy getting whacked by an umbrella
navia spinning around at the end felt so gorgeous
A true daughter of Napoleon. Artillery, artillery, and more artillery.
Now I can’t make up my mind if I want Navia or Nahida!!! Please somebody make my decision!
ELEGANTO! 🤌
her new companions looks so similar to her old ones, rip
I feel so bad I’ll be skipping her.
She. Will. Be. Mine. She doesn't have a choice...
Oh my god Navia is so terrifying when she's chasing somebody that poor thief
Идеальный трейлер
CAUSE BABY NOW WE GOT BAD BLOOODD
1:37 nahh, is she just use an aquabus for a race💀
Trying so hard to sell her huh? Fix Geo first
It’d be so cute if they change her glider to her parasol as a unique thing for her
She's gorgeous 🛐
Haha I love how they animated the thief and Navia's men its VERY reminiscent of Lupin the 3rd
SO COOL I LOVE IT
I knew this wouldn’t disappoint. She’s awesome ❤️
Absolute magneficent👏💛💛💛💛✨✨✨✨
i will not gacha navia i will not gacha naviaaa.....              :< mom can i have navia please?
Finally Navia is here to complete my 8 geo character showcase
sorry navia, hoyo refuse to rework geo so ez skip
The chasing scene 😂
Fun trailer. But is it just me or does her voice sound different?
I like her bubble... personality ;)
1:55 ARTILJERIJA
👍
W+ratio
Therapist: Navia bonaparte isn’t real. She can’t hurt you  Navia bonaparte: 1:55
Only if weren't for the glasses, I'd never pulled for her. But damn hoyoverse why did you give her sunglasses? Now i have to get her at any cost.
She's awesome 😎
AND GEO MAKES A COMEBACK
Fontaine is on another level.
Soundtracks are getting worse and worse....
my girl! love her sm so excited to pull for her
gözlüklerle bak 😅 artist ya😅
Genshin just keeps on getting better and better... Blow's my mind 🤯
Elegannntooooo
i love her
Ost hit hard
THE LYNETTE PART 😭
Her Demo is so magneficent 👏💛💛💛✨
She is a 6 star
SHE DID ALL THAT...IN HEELS  🔥🔥🔥
She's gorgeous 😍
0:39 So, I've heard of fighting in heels. But wallrunning in heels is a whole new level
0:24 с дороги!
This is when Share Bear is along with    mafia theme lol
Mother navia is mothering ❤❤❤
in heels bro
Lynette loll
как сильно🔥🔥
I love this demo! It’s got such a cool vibe to it, I love it. Please come hom Navia and good luck to Navia wanters
*catch the thief* navia : *proceeds into throwing her battle axe at him and then shoot him several times*
They should make it so that Navia uses her umbrella when gliding.
0:46 Charlotte taking pics <3
2:12 Bruh that sounds so much like the beginning of the Better call Saul theme 😆
2:10 they really did it
Woman is committing police brutality on an escaping thief 😂.
Is it just me who thinks her voice sounds different?
Can see memes of her shades incoming.
She sounds different
Ah yes Navia the FS Battleship
AMERICAN UPDATE: Lets go to catch some Criminals in California :))
navia is like the perfect combination of tropes you wouldn't expect to see together. she's got the elegance of a high society lady, the energy of a raucous [tom]boy, and the temperament of a vigilante
WE NEED AN UMBRELLA GLIDER!!!
furina who? the new drip queen is here
She did that in heels, ladies and gentlemen! In HEELS!
Swire
Wish she used her umbrella instead of the windglider
2:14 Wake up samurai we have city to burn
What an icon
Entah kenapa...semakin di perhatiin desain karakter Navia ini bagus banget cantik & elegan menyatu dgn busananya...benar2 bintang 5 👍🏻
นางเอกมาก ซื้อออออๆๆๆๆๆๆ
The demos just keep getting better and better
I still don't understand what happened with the voice change... In the quests she didn't have that voice, she was more mature and in keeping with her rank and experience.
best character demo
Oh, they removed the vocals for her theme ):
Good luck to everyone pulling for the young Demoiselle! Be sure to get your macarons and other sweets ready for your pull ritual!
Я сначала не хотела ее, а после этого видео очень сильно захотела себе в команду😀
kasian pengawal nya udah pada mati :(
She’s going to be like yoimiya, a good character but skipeable, I like his uniqueness, sun glasses, an axe, umbrella with cannons an an entire army of geo cannons
Fontaine demos are all so insane I love it,the budget just went FLYING
Taylor Swift cooking AF with that demo, but now imma go fullfill my end of the contract with dad Zhongli
the thief lowkey should be a 5 star
Taylor Swift coming in hot.
Can you fcing stop spamming same faces for all the npcs? I can't tolerate this trash anymore. Building face editor with a list of assets is not fcing hard, and won't take any game resources.
NAVIA IS SO GORGEOUS!! We need more curly-haired gurlies
Its gunbrella time
she is not human. she is a goddess
Gotta be honest, mad respect to her character. In her position I would have given up. Having the strength to go forward from where she stands is crazy. Almost made me cry during Act 5. Gonna get her tomorrow and build her strong enough to survive in my world of Teyvat.
Why does she need to be so perfect!? I still don't have Raiden...
Самая шикарная женщина
I just wanna point out: As a Gunlance user in Monster Hunter... Geo as Defence-Style and her Umbrella as a Gun are giving some heavy hypes 🙂
I love this demo to bits! The only thing I find unfortunate with Navia is that, because her axe is a claymore and needs to use claymore animations, she can't wield it as one would an axe.
Its so hilarious how she outruns a bunch of men in high heels. I love her so much 😂
This whole trailer format is kinda like itto trailer, agree?
We might need to curb our expectations if it takes 2 minutes to defeat a treasure hoarder. xD
She is strong and  fabulous… but so is the shogun. I’m conflicted, someone help me decide please 😢
Navia🤝 Eula ( demo theme with guitar)
Claymore? No...  Axe umbrella shotgun thingy? Yees.
shes a queeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen
Theif banner when????
до чего же она шедевральна...
2:12 Saul Goodman theme:
Tbh i miss the deeper voice she had, but the newer one still suits her.
After all depression in the archon quest (plus maybe in her own story quest) Navia deserve some happiness by chasing someone in her trailer.
My Italian queen! Guys pray for me to get her, otherwise I'm setting myself on fire
i want the music alone so bad
A Lady should not jump so much, Lady Navia.
I’ll never get over how amazing HoYoverse trailers are 😩😩 I’m so excited!!!
Music always 💀
😮😮😮 🤯🤯🤯 I❤Navia
do i need the weapon to get the gunbrella?
I want her to kick just like that thie... I MEAN WHAT HAHAHAHA WHAT A GOOD JOKE NAHHHH I BE TRIPPIN FRFR 💀💀💀💀
Navia with the Prada glasses. Sheeshh 🔥🔥
the most elegant and beautiful geo character❤❤❤
im really happy i quit genshin, imagine waiting for this
Is sge going to be in the standard?
Clorinde: I have a pistol  Chevreuse: I have a rifle  Navia: GET THT BITXH A CANNON BITXHES LOVE CANNONS 😂   if u know Wht thts from your goated
That guitar riff reminds me of something... Better call Navia
LITERALLY MOTHER
Линнет чисто така😑
Didn’t like the theme music very much, too generic
Napoleon would be proud of his Sicilian descendant
😍😍😍
A fine addition to my collection
May Navia waters be Navia havers!!!!
<3 <3 <3
good luck everyone , hope we win and early drop.
Даю слово пацана что не забуду Мелуса и Сильвера
I'm sorry Navia, I originally wanted to pull you but Cloud Retainer is now a thing.
pleasee come hommme naviaaa
why did they have to squishify her voice :(
A QUEEN WITH STYLE!!!! IM PULLING FOR REAL!!!!!! I LOVE A BADDIE WITH STYLE!!! SHES GOING ON MY LIST!!!
EU PRECISO DELA
Not Navia clocking people in style! We luv to see it
Increible
Now that I think about it, I actually wish Genshin’s weapon system was more like Star Rail’s Light Cones, where instead of weapons, you can equip characters with some kind of thing that still impacts their Attack while not affecting what they use as a weapon, allowing them to use whatever their weapon is, like Navia’s umbrella or Wriothsley’s gauntlets.  And before you say anything about catalysts, *stfu I don’t care*
NAVIA trailer is like an 007 trailer lol
Am I the only 1 here whos feel bad for the thief of his bad luck 😢 where hes been chased all day
Elegent as always tskr...🙏🙏
LYNETTE MY FAV CHRARACTER IS IN THE DEMO OF NAVIA OMGGGGG🤩🤩🤩🤩
She’s so cooollll wtffffff😭😭😭😭♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Hoyo finally spent some creativity i see 🗿
Amazing always can't wait to try it I am so excited 😊
I love her so much. I'm a husband collector and I never thought I'd spend wishes on a female character, but Navia will be my first waifu
i don't know if anyone else hears it, but the guitar strum at 2:11 reminds me of the music in the 3D saul goodman meme
Would be cool If she use her umbrella insted of Wings
is she using the battle fury? NOWAY
0:46 background Charolette and Navia's vaulting
they call her boss but only Melus and Silver will call her Mademoiselle ❤
Doctor? No need. They have one in Meropide
Her weapon should have be sword and then her special weapon her umbrella Not that I don't love the look of the axe but she is show using the umbrella ☔ you know
This game's getting better and better. I remember 3 yrs ago I had to struggle to buy a phone that could run this.(as I don't have a PC or anything.i don't even have a tv lol) Finally after getting a phone (after trying more than 2 yrs) I could finally play it & it's breathtaking.
А разве морская тень не упоминалась в диалогах с ханью из стар рейла?
the animation goes absolutely insane
I love this trailer
I love how Navia’s like “he’s still trying to resist me? Alright, orbital bombardment is a go!”
Did I hear Saul Goodman intro 🔥😶‍🌫️🧑‍🍳
I'm so glad this is all around feel good She deserves happiness after all the crap she's been through
Well that's was convenient 😂
I sure wasn't expecting Navia out of all the characters to have one of the best themes
That’s one lucky thief…
How i love blonds 😮‍💨
Tão bonita,  pena ser de geo❤😂😢
это настолько восхитительно - что мне пришлось местами смотреть покадрово, что бы словить максимальный кайф
@ 2:08 we got a new meme guys
THE BEST DEMO
at first I wanted to pull for Ayaka since I've been wanting her for a long time already. But after watching this I want Navia now 😭😭😭 Who should I pull?? 😭
This character demo is the sexiest next to Yelan's.
Is it me, or does her voice sound different?  Or maybe its just that i only recognize her voice as gloomy or crying
Taylor sw1ft come home!
Cool girls don't look at explosions
So we have another geo charachter, who is called boss
Como ela consegue ser tão glamourosa?!?! 🧡
FINALLY TYE BIG GUNS!
How in the Archons does she moves so darn fast but to slow to swing that claymore.
Geo’s not my favorite element but anything for navia!
As expected, woman using heels, running around DOING PARKOUR across the city, chasing criminals. Teyvat has its own laws. Anyway i still love her ❤❤
Nah not that good
;+; how does she move like that on heels.
She’s got canons as burst Fontaine is really getting advanced these days
the animation just keeps getting better and BETTER!
😎
Woah! We have another mommy, orphan, and boss lady!!
OH MY GOD THE TANGLED REFERENCE LMFAO I LOVE THIS
Out of all the Character Demos I've watched, Navia's Demo has to be the best one so far. So beautiful and elegant, and she's good at doing parkor. The thief shouldn't have walked in on an enemy territory. 😂
Navia is graceful, gorgeous, UNDEFEATED!!
AH GORGEOUS
She is so fun
Wow absolutely wonderful!!!!
А она прыткая! 😎
Girlboss be slayin'.
Who is going to become Navia main ❤🥰❤🥰❤🥰❤
все время ждал что он убежит от нее,но он не смог😢
SHES SO MOTHER MOTHRR MOTHEEEEEERR
First impression: she's a Kingsman agent
All of this in heels to i love this woman🥴
Her Umbrella reminds me of that of agent Galahad (Uncle Harry) from Kingsman.
Lynette   Was  Here ❤
dayum the shades though, Tylor swift of teyvat...
Pretty impressive
I LOVE HER!!! 😍 She's beautiful. But I'm afraid I'll have to skip since I need Raiden to optimize my dream team. I'll patiently wait for her rerun 👍
I just wish she uses her umbrella to glide
Amazing action scenes in this one. Navia's movements were super tight and clean. Absolutely loved how it fit so well with the music too. Lovely transitions! Another banger demo!
banger demo
I hope that I'll get her as soon as possible😊
Yo he proved that he's fast but she proved that she's faster.
Fine this was cute!!
Why did they change her English dub?
I love Steampunk Peach 👑
Watching this I was on the verge of tears because every genshin character is so good it makes me cry
I’m waiting for albedo but pulling for her wouldn’t hurt
Taylor swift as a mafia leader
I wonder if navia even uses a wing glider or just falls gently with her umbrella as a passive..
GTA in Fontaine
BABYGIRL.
Oh,my queen you so beautiful in every second
These demos are getting so good nowadays.  It's insane how well amazing most of these post Inazuma Demos are and it keeps getting better every nation. I'm extremely impressed.
umbrella warfare ig
Aaaah yes, di finally, American power in my hand!!!
Mary Poppins how she always should've been
We got an American in Genshin lets gooo
Please hoyo dont make her a standard banner character (or else i will clone your credit card /hj)
Damn i love her
Can't wait to pull here "Luckily" I lost my last 50/50 and I'm only 20 pull away from my pity so I'm guarenteed to get her
Navia's relatives are all dead but she still smiles while I've been depressed for a year
Hoyo's blondes are something fr
Insanely well done character demo for the best girl Navia. Hoyo did her justice and undoubtedly her story quest is gonna be just as good. She quickly become my favourite character ever since seeing her in the Fontaine trailer and then meeting her in the archon quest. Cannot wait to play her tomorrow 💛🖤💙
A TRUE BOSS
If her gliding animation is with her umbrella, thats worth a pull even shes geo.
OMG
are we not going to talk about her burst voiceline being "a proper send-off" BECAUSE MELUS AND SILVER DIDN'T GET ONE
In the first half, i can get the kaveh theme vibe and in the second phase I can get the alhaitam theme vibes. Am I the only one feeling it 💀
skip, Arlecchino is way better than her
only 10 seconds in and will continue with my Navia hype, BUT IS THAT PROZD TALKING AT THE START?
What a... MASTERPIECE!!! ❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Better Call Navia
OMG OMG  Navia.
Taylor Swift newest music video is so 𝑒𝓁𝑒𝑔𝒶𝓃𝓉
My honest opinion..."the best" trailer of genshin....its on par with raiden shogun ....like fast paced action trailer.. Maybe that's my preference.😊
Bro how are you running so fast in high heels?
Even in dresses, she could fight pretty well. Credits to Chiori who made her dress cuz she's slaying everyday
please, let Navia come home 😭 i cried during the whole demo ‘cause i’ve never been in love with the character so much, but i’ve managed to save only 63 pulls with 27 pity and no guaranteed 😭😭😭
EZ
Cute but...  Cloud Retainer.
I love Navia. She's kind and strong, even without the ones that have always been with her. Let's be her new Silver and Melus, except this time we'll be Gold.
The day Fontaine released i knew Navia was a must-have
SHE'S SO GIRLBOSS
Victorian Mob Boss / Underworld Queen. Lol
NOOOOO HER VOICE HAS TRULY BEEN BARBIE-FIED
Im on the fence about Geo Taylor Swift. I'll have to wait for the reviews and team comps 👀
I LOVE NAVIA!! THIS DEMO IS THE BEST!! IM GONNA WAIT UNTIL 2025 FOR THIS SONG TO DROP, I LOVE THE SPANISH AND CATALAN VIBES
Top notch animation for our top notch Navia
SHE'S PERFECT THE MUSIC, COMEDY, HER ABSOULUTE ELEGANCE?! PERFECT I TELL YOU.
Really hope hoyo goes back to the deeper voice from the Archon quest. this just... it makes her lose her charm.
Breathtaking
Why did they add the theme to better call saul at 2:12
Her passive shouldn't be increased resources when exploring, it should be slower descent when gliding and she has a parasol
I swear if one of her voice lines is something like “This is for Melus and Silver!” I’ll lose it
She’s very beautiful but I need C2 Raiden 😂😂😂
navia im sorry im currently saving for xiao😢 i promise ill pull on your rerun
What if Yang Xiao Long wears a dress and goes around with an umbrella....this
Good luck to those pulling for our new Geo archon!! 🍀Navia wanters will be Navia havers!
These Fontaine character trailers are so lively
am I the only one who spotted Better Call Saul's guitar riff at 2:12?
It's giving mother
Ok hear me out, I want Navia's umbrella as a glider, at least to use with her. And she running on the wall?? That was cool and if not in the game, that's just false advertising.
Can't wait to pull for this Queen. Good luck to everyone!
THIS WAS AMAZING WTF
I lover her!
If only movement in genshin had evolved to where it felt as good and this chase animation looked
Gorgeous
Omgggg
😍💕
2:09 cool guys don't look at explosions
lenette helping her is very polite, she wants to be younger sis to her❤
The most gorgeous I ever seen😭
Wish geo was more usable in different teams...
She's running..... WITH HEELS?!
They are COOKING hard on these new trailers man
2:12 No way they made the bgm sound a bit like the Saul Goodman meme
I must admit that this the best demo animation I've ever seen
On my way to clear the abyss with two geo teams featuring noelle and navia
GOSH ONE OF THE BEST CHARACTER DEMOS OF ALL TIME
Wishing for Melus and Silver to be on her demo😭
TAKE MY WALLET!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2:11 I though Saul Goodman theme started playing
imagine
why does it feels this is how princess peach shud be like in smash?
Imao... why its remember me Kancolle Kongou burning love?
ЭТО ТАК ЭПИЧНО ГОСПОДИ 😍😍😍
Is it possible to get a Glider - Umbrella for it?
the parkour sequence is INSANE
Mademoiselle is still such a ray of light even after all she's gone through! Her smile shall bring luck to all wanters. Mademoiselle Navia wanters will be Mademoiselle Navia havers! 💛
Actually the girl bossiest of all thus far ✨
Where is the parapap parapap??😢😢
That’s cool and all but what’s with her voice???
Navia i Love u !
She’s such a badass omg please
She's not Taylor Swift if she ain't fast
so sweet lynette
NOOOOO, THIS THEME IS SO GOOD! That is mean, Hoyo. You're gonna make us wait a year for it ):
Navia in this demo is so cool
Cool people don't look at Explosions.. 2:09
where tf is her banner
I love the trailer, the comedy, and the unexpected cameo of Lynette, my favourite girl
I just love how lynette just stood there only pointing the boat,she just so adorable
She high speed chasing with them heels!!!!!!!
She seems to be a very cool character tbh can’t wait to pull her at 2pm
This is one of the funnest trailers you ever did. Probs
You are one powerful rose that your father, and the two boys would be proud of Navia.
NAVIA IS SUCH A GIRLBOSS!! US FUTURE NAVIA MAINS WILL HAVE HER🕯️🕯️🕯️🕯️🕯️ BTW LYNETTES SO CUTE
TAYYYLOR SWIIIIIIIFT
Shes so beautiful oh my god i love her
"BOSS PUT YOUR UMBRELLA AWAY! "
cada demo mais cheia de caos que a outra kkk
They actually put Taylor Swift in Genshin!!???
If her plunged attack isn't her gliding down with a parasol what even is the point... But anyways incredible trailer as always!
better than that dumb water archon them co-op people drop me to 50% hp and dont even heal. they made me realize how much i freakin hate her mechanic’s and how i absolutely detest players who play her. i dont care if you do more damage at 50% man i want my HEALTH so i dont get one tapped by a monster or boss that doesn’t flinch!!!
i'm sure some old man will shout  *ELEGANTOOO*  on top of his lung after watching this trailer
Omg, she got a superhero landing!!!
The way the other agents called her "Boss" kind of reminds me of Itto and the Arataki Gang for some reason...😂  Also, cheers for another "cheerful" Geo character!🎉🎉🎉
This is so silly I can't😂
I haven't been a fan of Fontaine's character music tbh, specially compared to Sumeru's, but this one is an absolute bop! Definitely gonna pull for her!
wait you're telling me Navia runs fast... she's swift 😳
Genshin X RWBY
She is so tempting but im saving for cloud retainer aka xaio yun
Gila !! Keren abiez!!
Still not free though 😂 genshit is dead
her unhinged personality is a vibe
Hoyo really making it impossible for people to not pull for her 😭  Pls I want all characters of full 4.0 series 😭😭 I'm just a f2p player and my exams 😭 from 22 I'm dying
This is pure gold! oh my✨
damn, this taylor swift is lit
Shotgun, Axe, Canon and an Umbrella attack. Definetly need a doctor.
noice
Navia bring YAMAKASI to the whole new level   also    "Congrats for you to bring a robot to a whole naval battle"
Ohhhhh yeah!!!
Geo maybe the worst element in-game but they always have the best Character designs in my opinion.
If i don't get her, I'm crying myself to sleep
Пацаны, давайте слово дадим, Мелуса и Сильвера не забудем✊
the fingerstyle guitar is fit so well
Bro that theif is super fast.
love how flowy the demos are recently
Yay, I love Taylor Swift fan edits
Is that Welt's VA who played Navia's lad in the beginning?
These new trailers are getting super good
What a Girl Boss
WHERES HER BANNER AT
Bruh that first guitar strum reminded me of better call saul theme 💀. Jokes aside. Tomorrow is the day we pull for our taylor swift
YEAHHHHH BABY THAT'S MY DEMOISELLE FOR YA!  Good luck to everyone pulling for the icon herself in 4.3!
Why does her voice sounds so different 😭 It feels higher than in the story quest.
The plot the editing the character are all so 😍❤️❤️❤️
why does geo characters always have so much flair and style😂😂
Why does she sound like that
Damn. I hope i win 50/50 on raiden's banner so i can pull for navia. She will be my first 5 star geo character. I really want it to be her. 😅
Her voice sounds different...
This is like the nation of fun characters that can still 36 star abyss aswell😂 Tysm for fontaine hoyo! Best nation ever
I feel like things aren't quite right..
Les démos sont de plus en plus dynamique j'aime bien
Taylor Swift x Iron-man concept. I love it.
Rednas is gonna love this 😂😂
THE WAY THEYRE HOLDING HER UMBRELLA TO STOP HER FROM FLYING AWAY GETS ME EVERYTIME 😭😭😭
YAS GURL! SLAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!
Novia
Awesome to see Geo making an appearance and with style this time 😎. Now its time to watch the best of the best, here we go Zhongli 🔥
Naviaaaa!!!
This is PEAK
Es cosa mía, o el soundtrack de la demo de Navia está muy inspirada en El Tango de Roxxane 😍🌹💃
I am confused is she French or freaking Italian? Callas is a French village, Poisson a French word, there is accordeon in her theme and now Navia is nor French nor Italian as an etimologic name... What is she?!
Heh, very cool) I fell for Navia when I saw her for the first time ❤ I like her sunny disposition,  her beautiful design... and her name too) Good luck tomorrow, everyone))
0:15 why is this part so funny 😭😂✨
I’m not even gonna question how she can runs so fast on the walls in *heels*
i love our girlboss queen
My credit card is already feeling the pain
Her and Yelan would honestly be one of the best combinations. They would make great business partners. Yelan could use Navia's connections to Fontaine's Resources, and Navia would do well with Yelan's ingenuity and experience in catching criminals. Not to mention, they're personalities would make for great character dynamic. ❤❤❤
Those sunglasses are amazing on her😂😂😂
i need navia pls bbg hoyoverse thank you pookie uwu bear
The only Geo character I've ever genuinely been excited to pull/play <3
ok skip and bring the raiden banner
WAKEY WAKEY.
WHERE IS SHE SHE HASNT BEEN IN THE BANNER WAKEY WAKEY
Fabulous~~
WHERE IS SHE.
This make me Geo Hard .... also Hard skip
How to catch a criminal the American-French Way.
Fake companions, those two prolly gonna die too knowing ho unfortunate navia is
ВАУ ЭТО НЕВЕРОЯТНО, ВЫБИВАЮЮЮ
Она просто лучшая, Боже.❤
Let us be Navia 3rd companion GO YOU GIRLBOSS!   (3rd because the 1st and 2nd will always be Melus and Silver. Let them rest in  peace o7)
SHE LOOKS SO COOL
IM SIMPING SO HARD RN the music and everything was perfect
This trailer really killed it, the NPC's here gave out so much expression and gosh Navia. Damn it man this trailer really making trying to go for Navia when I decided I needed to go for Raiden lol 😅
Gangplank but wrong
Don't care if Furina has the title. Navia will always be the Fontaine girl to me.
EZ skip
i swr genshin music never fails to disappoint i love navia’s theme and i can also hear hints of furina’s whats so cool
Itto energy but if he could actually do everything he says he can
DEFINITELY PULLING WOAH :3‼️‼️
The ending lmaooo also she's so pretttyyyyy❤
I only have 1 word: Girlboss
NAVIA ROSE UP AND ATE THIS DEMO
navia music is so good
I need someone to make a meme of every character. And then there’s navia crawling through wall with shadowed face and glowing eyes chasing this thief 😂
R.I.p tye man on the right 😂 0:24
My friend said i wish it was him 0:52
Thank you for free Dr. Ratio
'a proper sendoff' to that guy indeed! what a super chad! <3
Better call Navia 2:11
this is so epic, I love it :D
I already watch it, now its time to fullfill my contract
Slay girl
Finally Navia lalatina 💛
I love how Lynett was there being so cute❤
I love the idea of navia basically being a mafia boss
And she's wearing hills while running what a badass😮
SHE GIVES OFF PRINCESS PEACH VIBES AND I LOVE IT🫶violent but still feminine omg she’s such a girlboss
SHE WILL BE MINE(goodkuck on yall navia pulls)
whoever is working on these character demo animations def needs a raise cause the animation is crazy for this one
1:37 Man that umbrella has to be the most sturdiest umbrella ever for withstanding that much wind without blowing over! 😂 Such a funny demo. She looks like a queen in those shades too 😎👑✨
Necesito a Navia en mi vida 😎❤
I always beleive for Navia , Meluse and Silver were sames as what Alfred and Robin are for Batman .
i think i get it, she also uses "Domain Expansion: Delusions"
this is so good.
Ladies and Gentlemen, i present you Navia. She did allat with boot heels 😰‼️
If she didnt receive a geo vision, she wound definitely obtain an anemo vision.
2:16 Wake the f*** up, traveller. We have a Teyvat to burn
Geo mains its our time!
Господи, оглядываясь назад во времена инадзумы сравнивая трейлеры персонажей это просто небо и земля, я в восторге! ❤❤
Que guapa mi novia
Why she wiring goggles 😆
2:12 Sounds a lot like Better meme Call Saul
FABULOUS
Zhongli: big meteor Navia: the entire artillery
woah mamas
Since she Geo.. I'm not gonna pull any single Geo element again
Love how everybody thinks about Navia's design when mhy is still not delivering endgame after 3 years. Good job dudes
Why doesn’t she have a unique gliding animation with her umbrella?
How on earth can you skip this QUEEN?! Tthough, I do wish they had shown this badassery in game instead of her crying every patch she was in...
OH MY GOD SHES SO PRETTY AAAAAAAAAAA I CANT WAIT TO GET HER TOMORRROOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWW
She was born to be elegant~
She did cascades and run in high heels?! Damn girl…
I didn't expect that comeo
Holy, what a demo
What is this Kingsman bs? i like it tho but why does it resembles kingsman so much?
#coolguysdontlookatexplosions
The chase was so funny and I love going on speed boats so that bit on the water was even better
😮😮😮😊😊😊
Everything about Fontaine is peak
NAVIA GO BRRRR
Cómo idénticas a un ladrón Random cuyo modelo se repite por todos los demás enemigos de su tipo en este juego donde reciclar modelos aplica incluso entre los aliados que están con el personaje y que se parecen a dicho ladrón también ladrón mostrado en el vídeo.  O sea que Genshin sea un mundo simulado es una cosa, pero que cada NPC tenga más gemelos que la enferma Joy de Pokémon pues es flojera de la empresa, ya no estamos en 2004 para repetir modelos como en el half life.
For her special, she wields a gun
LYNETTE-  😂
she's the best😭😭😭 i don't really care if she's useful or whatever, her design is so detailed and well done,  she doesn't just wear a bunch of colorful rugs like most of female characters in genshin.... this is real clothing and it looks gorgeous!! she shines with her personality and i kin her so much😭 i decided i'll pull for her the moment i saw the blurrred leaks, and still i wasn't expecting her to turn out to be such an amazing character!!! good luck to everyone🌹
Lynette casually helping Navia out was so cute
Navia my Love! She looks great! Great job with the VA! This demo showcases her personality really well. Excellent work!
🇬🇧🇬🇧🦅🦅🦅🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
2:10 not that breaking bad sound que...
Navia is so fast even when wearing a dress and high heels
Why you uploaded video of my wife😡😡
Navia Mains Rise ❤🔥
God bless hoyoverse for giving us this lovely lady 🙏
i spotted charlotte
Cool girls don't look at explosions, they cause them and then they walk away 🤣
Wow finally we have the final element in Genshin Impact released, Geo is going to change everything!
Definitely Mary Poppins & Taylor Swift's child
why are all the fontaine characters so badass
Mwe
when they said tough men dont look at explosion... they forgot the fabulous lass
Everytime I see navia I say “it’s fearless” Taylor swift😭😭😭❤️
UGH I LOVE HER
NAVIAA WTH SHE SO COOL
2:11 – Saul Goodman)
Anyone noticed her voice a bit different now compared during 4.0 ver?
I NEED HER FULL CHARACTER DEMO'S MUSIC
That was beautiful, navia is such a character I love her
Is there an overworld theme the music is based on? I swear it sounds familiar
MORE LYNNAVIA CONTENTYAYA
Soooo..... what's gonna happen if Arataki Itto meet Navia 🤔🤔
1:31 why sm i so obsessed with this moment
She's crazy😭😭😭
Seeing two of her men struggling to keep her umbrella intact during the boat chase is very hilarious😂😂
NAVIA WILL COME HOME!!!!! 💎🌹💎🌹💎🌹💎🌹💎🌹💎🌹💎🌹💎🌹💎🌹💎🌹💎🌹💎🌹💎🌹💎🌹💎🌹💎🌹💎🌹💎🌹💎⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
but also, is it just me or did they make her voice pitch a little higher??
It would be cute instead of gliding, she uses her umbrella
SHES SO COOL UGHHH
Navia is the definition of a girlboss
slay just slay she is top tier
i love you ms navia all my homies love you ms navia!!!!!
If only she wasn’t geo AND claymore😢😢😢
what's up with her voice? she sounds completely different from Navia in the story so far
She is so graceful and gorgeous & even cute now I am even more sad I have to skip her 😭😭😭
Why always woman have cool character with 3 weapon? Why mihoyo??? We need man character cool like this😂
I love her. I love her design, I love her backstory, I love her personality, I love her playstyle, And I LOVE this!!! Good luck to all Navia wanters! ❤
So with her how many members are now there in the geo family now.......
definitely a klee vibe love it
I love her🤗😎 and her theme music is amazing!!!!
Am I delusional or it is a Better Call Saul reference? 2:12
I swear I have a thing for Geo, I need to remind myself, I can't have all of them!!
I don't need another DPS. I don't need another DPS. I don't need another DPS.
It's clearly an axe but are they still going to classify it as Claymore or are we finally getting new weapon types?
I did not know the sunglasses were real 😭
0:46 I KNEW I SAW CHARLOTTE STANDING IN THE BACKGROUND  I thought I was going insane
The PhotoOp is so high!
0:46 Hey Charlotte!
OMG NAVIA COME HOME MY BBG !!! EARLY PITY PLS GENSHIN IM BEGGING SO BAD ILL GET ON MY KNEES RN FOR HER EARLY PITY!! SHE MUST COME HOME
U NAILED IT LADY NAVIAAAAAA
Ран васяран
Forget about Genshin anime, I want a show about the daily life in the Spina di Rosula
OMGGGG
Navia is a vibe and I am all here for it.....👑👑👑
Truly, elegant I love it
too bad Genshin developers don't invest this much in in-game cutscenes...
If Navia is so fast, why she fell from bridge..?   So traveller and paimon are faster than Navia ?
ลูกน้อง2คนตายหมด
Instead of a wind glider, she glides with her umbrella... would be cool if its actually like that.
I so wanna pull her but sadly I want Shogun and her weapon 😢😢
Absolute perfection 💛 👑 wish she has the ability to glide with her umbrella.
I WANT HER SO MUCH
NAVIAAAAA SLAYYYYY
Elle est tellement incroyable j'espère que j'aurais assez de Primo
time to watch zhongli
Taylor Swift😍
SHES SO PERFECT
Taylor Swift of Genshin Impact
Lynette
Man i love how chaotic and fun this demo is❤
Why i had to find cyno  .... I wanted her so much , She Is so beautifull
Love the music
POV me whenever I go out with my friends: Them: Please boss put your umbrella away! You'll get bad luck🤞 Me literally: what umbrella? This is my weapon ehe 😖😊😊
I just really love her weapon it's so different from other claymores 😍
Navia coming for the title of coolest Genshin character! 😎👑
The Treasure Hoarders seem to attract a lot of talent despite an utter inability to attract brains. I'm sure "The Flight of the Bungling Sea-" will make a nice addition to our scorebook.
ОНА ПРОСТО НЕВЕРОЯТНАЯ
Music so nostalgic. Feeling Mega man vibe.
Кайф
Queen Navia ❤
Проходная лега и про такой же трейлер. Ждём 4.4 там будет лучше.
Lynette just happening to be around to help Navia catch the thief is just so like her
I still wonder to this very day where the HECK she gets those sunglasses.
What a character, I like her now
Navia parkour in heals in the sewer😂
Wow really beautiful 🥰
NAVIA MY LOVE I CANT WAIT
This is just soo wholesomee
Oh this is post melus and silver😭
The fact when my very very little brother was watching stronk cat , Navias slide while catching the thief was like “WEEP”
Taylor swift doing crime work now, does she sound a little different tho?
I love how chaotic this whole demo is! Navia is such a mood ❤
Genshin is what happens when people who should be filming movies decide to make a game instead. The gameplay part is awful 99% of the time. But everything else - the world, the story and especially the characters - are PERFECT.
Rest easy melus and silver. Navia now has a lot of new guards here in the comments  protecting her now. 😂
I'm currently at 79pity because I was trying to Ayato. Now, I'm just gonna wait for Navia instead. ISTG if I didn't this 50/50, I would be so mad.
Is it just me or i feel when she use the umbrella at 0:43 looks like she's playin' golf LMAO
MOTHER IS MOTHERINGGGG
welcome home navia
Navia reminds me a lot to the Yellow form transformation in Vividred Operation
The Godmother of Fontaine
çok tatlı olmuş la
A IN NAVIA MEANS ATEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
What did they do to Navia’s voice 😢 she sounds so high pitched now
Navia demo? No Sea-shadow demo? Yes
وش ذا الإعلان الجميل وش ذا الجمال وش ذي اللطافه وش ذي الكوميديا 😭😭، ابي اجيبها بس لا لا بجيب الشخصيات القديمة أفضل
Navia demo? No Sea-shadow demo? Yes
Why did they make her voice so much higher pitched?
she's so beautiful man i'm in love
I love her and her gang ☀️🤗
Godamm she's beautiful
Why i should have her? 1.Im a person averyday carry umbrella☂️😂 2. Kings man + Tailor Swift vibe lover🔥♥️
Продано!
My reaction 😎/ 😳🕶️🤏
2:11 *Better Call Navia*
Is it just me or is her voice way higher pitched then usual?… Either way I’m so excited for Navia 💛
I love her ❤️❤️❤️
Petition to make Navia’s umbrella a windglider?
She is truly Ms.WorldWide
bro i never waited for a character to drop since venti in 2020
Really hype, she's too cool !
Charlotte is in this demo at 0:46 You can see her if u slow the video down.
2:12 sounds like Better Call Saul Main Theme
diva
SHE’S SO PRETTY I SWEAR THIS IS GONNA BE MY FAV 5* CHARACTER DEMO OF ALL TIME
Taylor Swift 😎
NAVIA VEN A CASA POR FAVOR
QUEEN
i don't like this song
Ficou muito maneiro! Capricharam bastante no trailer da Navia, MAS, ela é do elemento Geo. Então tomem cuidado, guys! 'Faça os tiros valerem a pena' - By Joel (Tess)
how can she running so fast with her high heels?
Steam version when
I LOVED IT AHAHAHHAHAY ❤❤❤ AND I LOVED THE LYNETTE CAMEO!!
If Neapolitan was blond and could speak her name would be Navia
Honestly I would watch Genshin if it was a series with the animation like this alone
1:10 she has got some insane drip
I'm sorry Navia, but we'll see you at your rerun... 😔
Oh how I wish her wind glider is her umbrella😭
The most beautiful female character in Genshin. Her personality is so beautiful too
She sounds so cute
Is it just me or does her voice sound a little off?
This cutie is coming home tomorrow 🥰
Spanish Navia confirmed
I cant wait to get her on my account, love the trailer 😊
After all the weird Demos... This is one of the best Normal demos ever.  It's just soo well done rhythmically
That's how u do deal with opponents ........... with ELEGANCE and STYLE.
Lynette: *koong *koong
She more to British arsenal than America like people said😂 america? elegant like her 😂😂
See you tomorrow.
What a great demo ! I’m so giddy to have Navia come home !!
PRINCESS OF FONTAINE!!
This is an example of me as a Treasure hunter where chase me from Navia and forces me to pull/roll on her banner
She is so beautiful <3
The Parkour Princess
The best character demo so far bro! Even if I’m not pulling for navia this time I will in her rerun! ❤and melus and silver … you’ll never be forgotten… always and will stay in our hearts.
NAVIA WANTERS WILL BE NAVIA HAVERS
She's going to get along just great with itto
1:54 *eagle screech*
This is fire I’m excited for her to come out
Xianyun is coming 😂😂😂😂
Hope Klee and Navia meet each other in the future patch.
her w her glasses down is literally everything.
The first time i saw her design, before fontaine was even released I actually thought she was going to be a 'gentlemen(lady) thief' type character, so it's pretty fun to see her hunting one down for her demo!
Sorry navia ... about to pass you for mommy cloud retainer....she need to come home
i absolutely love everything about navia
i told myself i wasnt gonna roll no matter how cool her weapon looked because i love axes but god... i think im giving in shes so gorgeous
Cannot believe taylor swift can run like this 😮
Skip....................
I love the absolute chaos happening here, even despite that Navia stays gorgeous and fabulous as always, that girl ain't giving up
definition of girlboss  she is a girl boss... and shes a damn good one
c'est génial 😂
Ok, I know everyone's gushing over Navia, but I unironically wanna see more of the Sea-Shadow guy. The fact that he made such a blatant slip-up, coupled with his goofy goober physicality, instantly characterized him in my mind as this poor bloke who gained his notoriety through sheer dumb luck and cartoon slapstick, and that sounds like an absolute RIOT.
We found Mami's Mom as well.😅
A NEW TEST OBJECT !!!!
NAVIAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!
why she so ... urgghhhhhh 😮😮
SHE'S SO PRETTY, WHO WOULD NOT PULL FOR HER. 😭
ready to lose the 5050
her theme hits hard
The poses 0:23 and animations 0:26 of Spina di Rosula's members is just too good, especially the one swinging his arms in the air lmao
Bro got an eyefull when navia landed on him💀
Thank you hoyoverse for persuading me into pulling for Navia
Bruh i feel like this is the most expensive Demo yet with that many action and cutscenes
Amazing demo! Can't wait to pull for her tomorrow
Is she faster then Yelan if it’s yes I’m make her next mammy
ALL IN HEELS TRUE GIRL BOSS
Is her voice different?! Or am I just not hearing it? 😢 She seems more... perky and high-pitched than she did in the story I think
Genshin trailer music really fell off after Yu peng chen leave
I have her guaranteed, I'm so excited!
Easy pull
Her music theme is such a bop. Fits her perfectly ❤
this demo is so silly i'm inlove with her
2:12 did I just hear better call Saul theme for a sec ?
A western in France. I’d like to think she’s American
omg her trailer is so cute and transitions/animations are so smooth
she's so good!
نافيا نافيا نافيا نافيا ارجوكيييييي تعاليييييييييييي اطلع لييييييييييييي نافيا احبك😢
The animation is so cool what the heck
hoyo trying to convince me to pull her
2:12 i was expecting the breaking bad theme to play XD
F Melus and Silver 😢
HER THEME IS INSANE
Not gonna lie her umbrella remind me of the "bow gun" in monster hunter
SHE IS BEAUTY. SHE IS GRACE.
goodbye ayato, ill get you sometime in the near future
Scooter Braun’s funeral: Taylor’s version
Cool Guys and Gals don’t look at explosions. I also love how Navia went to the Monty Oum school of weaponry. It’s Ruby Rose approved.
Ain't she just gorgeous
I just have a retort, since Fischl's glide animation doesn't have Oz carrying him by the shoulders, or Kujo Sara flying up with her own wings, the umbrella glide should be canon.   Ain't no way I'd want her glide with fancy prosthetic wings, instead of her own Umbrella which you've teased since earlier.  her hair is as twirly and long like Bronya Rand or Durandal that gotta clip if you give her prosthetic wings/fancy-glider, just please be only Umbrella to glide for her. Maybe Kujo Sara flying with her own 4 wings too...
Fancy
those poor guys fighting for their lives trying to keep that umbrella in place 😅
Her expressions woahh. Also she is just so elegant. Hope everyone can get her ^_^
BADASS TAYLOR SWIFT
Navia pleaseee, come home ~~~~~~
Theres no such thing as too much Navia.
Who the thief?
NAVIA COME HOME PLEASSSSEEE
We better have her In genshin profile photo to Have those glasses
IS SO GORGEOUS😭😭😭😭🙏🙏💛💛
Navia is the definition of: “anyways, I started blasting”
I'll pull for Ayaka. Good luck to everyone <3
ANOTHER GEO FOR ME TO C6 💖
She will be home!!
This is literally Mary Poppins but in Genshin Impact
Good luck on your pulls everyone!!! Furina cleaned me out, so I'll need some good luck on this banner!!
2:09 Me when I commit arson 🔥🔥
Best big sister figure ever
she slay the world fr.
I really want her, but do I really need a geo character right now? The troubles of a f2p player
Girl got her weapon from the RWBY universe. 😂 Gokd luck yl those that want her
I just love how flashy yet she's gorgeous
NAVIA MAINS WILL BE NAVIA HAVERS, I SWEAR!
She could be a star in a Tarantino film holy moly
Good character but boring element.
Idk that Taylor Swift is a runner but hey she's a track star fr ✨
Her design and kit kinda remind me of Mami Tomoe from Madoka Magica. Hopefully she goes on standard banner, would like have a chance to get her losing 50/50
Does this feel sped up to anyone else?
I'm claiming her RIGHT NOW I BETTER I WILL WIN MY 50/50
to think that Navia almost get killed by the main story plot, i am glad that she survived and finally is here lol
Давайте признаем, что увидев Линнет, у каждого проскользнуло удивление и улыбка.
The prettiest girlboss ! May Navia wanters get her in their accounts 💛
Navia serving sass, speed, and cannons – an absolute stunner!! ★
if i have a lot of Primo i would get her banner But man i need Raiden for my team XD
2:10 reminds me of that disaster girl
I'm in love but I'll keep saving for mommy xainyan 😂❤ and Xiao indeed too lol
Somebody please tell me if Teyvat has sunglasses, why didn't we get more characters wearing it? 😂
Hearing the motifs in the music from the livestream is always my favorite part of the character demos.
Yes im sea shadow pls land on me
I adore the entire story in her demo, Hoyoverse made her shine like the girlboss that she is!  May all Navia wanters be Navia havers!
man the animation 🥵❤️❤️❤️💯
Zamn
Her elemental burst’s* “proper sendoff” works as a double meaning to gun salute. She never forgets those two.
Navia will be coming home upon release finally! I was planning on saving for Itto next, but Cloud Retainer is serving mother and making me want to wish for her.
I must get the french Taylor Swift
She fight with an umbrella. THAT'S JUST AWESOME!!!
In my Geo Gunbrella Era
Vincenzo
TAYLOR SWIFT!
geo might be the element with the least amount of characters but at least they all have the most IMMACULATE drip
was the new guard's voice ProZD? it sounded very much like him. edIT: at 2:17
i love her theme so much oh my
Guaranteed and now i am ready to get the gun lady, I will main her next lmaooo
I feel like this is more of a trailer than an actual character demo but whatever its still great lel
"Please boss put your umbrella away" Navia: "Pff, aesthetics over physics😎"
Tango suits her perfectly
AHHHH this demo is so cool!!! Navia is so cool rahh!! ANDDD THE LITTLE SCIENCE WITH LYNETTE AWW
Hear me out, small geo catalyst user that lowers defence. I wanna see a baby throw rocks at people
Последние презентации персонажей очень хорошо получаются
absolutely love how she just shoots people
The trailers have gotten so fun and unique lately, it’s so cool seeing how much improvement has been made throughout the years. I’m really enjoying these trailers!
She's so cool mann
subway surfers thats all im gonna say
HER UMBRELLA'S A GUN HER UMBRELLA'S A GUN HER UMBRELLA'S A GUN HER UMBRELLA'S A GUN HER UMBRELLA'S A GUN AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
She's bringing in the heavy artillery
Still no free five stars 🙄
I LOVE HERR, THE LYNETTE INTERACTION WAS SO CUTE TOO, FUTURE NAVIA MAIN!!!
JUST COME HOME PLS
Navia's demo with spanish music vibes
Despite all the episodes and loss she went through in archon quest, she's still so energizing and continue dazzle everyone so marvelously.  My queen is just too strong 💛💛💛
OMG, is Taylor Swift!!!
LOVE HER SO MUCH OMFG SHE'S PERFECT
OH HER OST BANGS!!!!
Ooo 0:23 OOF
Still here exploring Mondstadt!
Navia is my mother
WHOOOOOOO
Why is Genshin looking more and more like RWBY then...well, RWBY?
The bgm is so bad without YPC
"Maybe I am , maybe I am not "👨🚬
AAAAAAAA- I HAVE WAITED FOR NAVIA SINCE THE FONTAINE TRAILER!!! Our Mafia boss is so beautiful, i live the vibe of the trailer 💛💛
The most beautiful genshin character 🔥
Мэри Поппинс 😼💝
She is so majestic!!!
I love how Lynette is just casually drinking tea while helping Navia 😂
this is the picture of the thief. the thief: laterally wearing a mask
I can't be the only one who's getting a MASSIVE espada music vibes (bleach fans rise)
she's so girlboss
meh
QUEEN TAYLOR SWIFT IS HERE
she reminds me of Roberta from Black Lagoon with her umbrella gun
Very nice video and keep it up. I like how her normal attacks uses umbrella as weapon. Unfortunately its an easy skip for me as Navia carries a Geo Vision which means it has no synergy with other elements. I really wish Navia was a Pyro unit because it makes more sense that her skill and burst cause burning damage DOT and I would be definitely all over her. Really a missed opportunity here!
Noice
Lynette carried the demo HAHAHAHAHA
Navia's demo enters as one of the best Genshin Demo
NAVIA ❤
Still with style❤😊❤
Taylor Swift in genshin 😊
she's girlbossing too hard for her new bodyguards to handle lol
Very swag
1:30 Lynette is so cute
Kick me Navia
HOPE ALL NAVIA WANTERS BE NAVIA HAVERS (Including me). MELUS AND SILVER WILL BE MISSED😢
Она "Привет" по-русски сказала?
Our Mafia Queen is coming to GTA6 bro🎉
people commenting about melus and silver: please STFUUU they're literally npcs
Navia really showing us how to run in heels is done damn. The music is beautiful and so is she what a prettu design.
What a boss.
Let's all be honest the three Lady characters from Fontaine we are all most happy about are  Furina, Navia, & Clorinde. While the Naive is kind of a Joker card thrown into the mix at this point.(I still don't think she's human either)
Bro they make her demo rock hard with that long cutscenes
Those transitions are as smooth as my brain
She *ATE* She *SLAYS* She *LEFT NO CRUMBS*
Man this is good
she is so gorgeous !!!
2:11    Better Call Saul Goodman 💀
played for the daddies, stayed for the mommies. ill be pulling for u Navia Swift!
I am convinced that Navia's bodyguards are only there for moral support at this point 😂
Usual character demos: said character defeating waves of enemies.  Navia: beats the soul out of a single treasure hunter. Also *shoots* them multiple times. Treasure hunter somehow lives.
Navia: "A  proper send off!" Big ole 3 canons Mami from Madoka Magica: "Trio Finale!": Also using a large cannon
LETSS GOOOOOO❤❤❤❤
Love how Navia doesn't understand the concept of "Show some Restraint."
Fabuloso, espero que ya sea mañana
I was hoping to hear the vocal in the demo like in the 4.3 version trailer, still this is nice too
It would be amazing to have the umbrella as a glider specially for Navia 😮
que buena demo
You know if I were Genshin Hoyoverse, I would give Navia or Ayaka for FREE at this point like HSR, but we know, we know, Genshin could nvr!! 🥹
Come home Taylor Swift!!!
00:20 😂😂
Навия будто  глава мафии 😂
The sunglasses are solely the reason why I'm pulling
This demo gonna made me pull for her😑
SHE IS THE BEST CHARACTER IN GENSHIN PERIOD !!!
DAMN they went all out on this trailer!
2:11 no one gonna mention better call saul intro rift here? or is it just me😅
Manifesting navia🧎✨
Navia after playing Assassin's Creed be like:
The Geo Queen 👑🪨
Navia Swift 🌂
Navia tan hermosa como siempre 💛✨
I’m so glad I’m guarantee for her, I hope I get her and her weapon!
It's incredible how these character demos just keep getting better somehow!
0:45 Charolette cameo!
0:45 Oh, good to see you doing your job Charlotte !! :)
The skid at 1:23 has strong Keystone Cops energy, I have to say.
Yay
QUEEN
Her shades got an upgrade!!!!!!
Es aquí donde todos mis ahorros valdrán la pena 👏🏼
She is… GORGEOUS. My goodness, Hoyo, what a beautiful trailer! 🥰✨👏
Didnt know the boats were that fast
02:12 Saul Goodman Moment
Какая девушка! Мне б такую!❤
navia is SO DRIPPY, actually blinged out - those sun classes dauymn
I cant stop relating her with Taylor Swift 😂
Hoyo, we're gonna have a problem if she doesn't glide with her umbrella.
Damn Navia she fast af boi
NAVIA ABSOLUTELY SLAYED IN HER DEMO (quite literally)
I almost forgot how good these were... too bad broke
To be stylish necessary to have two people to hold your open umbrella. Like a boss!
goosebumps all over!!! very nice demo for the best girl
Melus and silver 😢
Dang is it already here?
1:38 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Navia looks so slay in those sunglasses
SHE'S THE MEANING OF FABULOUS
This character demonstration and reveal made me think of RWBY and RoosterTeeth. Now I want to teach anime. Thank you, Hoyoverse. 😂
AHHHHHHHH THANK YOU FOR BEING BEAUTIFUL NAVIA
*And in heels.* 👠💅💅💅
She is gorgeous, she is fabulous, but most importantly.. She PARKOUR
great
She's so pretty, so fabulous and elegant, and dedicated and relentless. I laughed how she never gave up the chase. I bet she'd chase anyone across the entire nation teehee. She's awesome. Can't wait for you Mademoiselle Navia ❤
so no one gonna talk about how she's faster than all her guards though she carries a literal cannon
Wao
HER THEME IS SO FIRE
YASS QUEEN!! ✨✨
1:31 I like how Hoyo is starting to include other characters and the character demo beside the feature 5 star. It’s a really nice touch and make them feel more alive and real!  Edit: all y’all mad for what🤨
I love how she casually slaps the guy with an umbrella and poses afterwards
GIRL
She's giving main character of an action movie 💅💅💅
NAVIAAAAAAAAAA!!!!! 😍🤩🤗  She. Is. FABULOUS!!!  She. Is. HER!!
The thief threw down a palette like he's in a DBD chase lol
LYNETTE DE INVITADA❤
Man, I cry with how much she's lost and dealt with. I love her so much. She's so pretty and so badass.
She’s so joyful! I hope she’s one of the good geo characters but I still can’t get over the fact that she refused to put her umbrella away.
this demo is insane! i love her
praying for goddess navia !!
Can't describe how much I love how Navia's claymore is concealed in her umbrella, like a cane-sword.  Melus and Silver are also there, but what a graceful character, been a while since we got a geo one.
Yup, its Taylor Swift.
ok now i am definetely gonna pull for her!!
Why the f*** that thief arrived infront of em when they were discussing bout him 😂😂😂😂?
Wow, the Penguin isekai into a beautiful woman.
waos
Is it just me, or is that yet another fabulous ProZD NPC voice I hear? :D
better if they made her glide using her umbrella
Lynette is so cute!
Come Home Taylor Swift🗿
Cloud retainer ended her career already 😅
Her theme is so good like the icon she IS.
I fear I won't be able to get this fabulous not-mob boss, simply because I've been too lucky thus far - two Neuvillettes, Furina, and the latter's weapon LL in a row without losing a single 50/50? Nuh-uh, there's no way this streak keeps up. But that won't stop me from trying, damnit!  Edit: Holy crap I got her! And still no lost 50/50 (yet)!
She's so cool, wish i can get her but im pulling for Raiden, aaaaa
Let’s be real she is THE BEST GEO CHARACTER
That 0.1 sec frame that Navia had that wide smile in her burst is too darn cute! 1:55
Navia is really like a boss. I love her so much🥰🧡
Poor Sea-Shadow, man really fell victim to wrong place wrong time. And man was doing a great getaway but they had better resources.
Lyney: Cards Navia: Umbrella Charlotte: Camera Flash What unique ways to kill an enemy 😂
I WILL GET HER.  edit: I GOT HER
QUEEN NAVIA  I WILL BE A FUTURE NAVIA MAIN 🙏🏼
Navia owns artillery for hunting criminals cause that's what the Fontainian Fathers intended.
her voice needs to be deeper this voice doesn't suit her at all
Following the deaths of Melus and Silver, Navia seemed to maintain a cool composure, able to help with reparations and rebuilding, but she couldn't help but develop a crippling addiction to helium off-screen.
was that the better call saul meme at the end?
Navia should be able to glide with her umbrella instead of a wind glider
This is such a cool animation! Now I want this in game quests and story as well 😂
.
Genshin trailers are just fascinating
_Gunbrella_ 😎🌂
NAVIA MARY POPPING HER WAY DOWN WITH HER UMBRELLA 😭😭
Navia being overkill with the enemy  Beautiful
Love the trailer!! Navia is so cool!!!
i love you Navia😊🫶🫶🫶
One of the many requirements  for the workers is to grab the Boss Umbrella so we don't have a repeat of the Fontaine Teaser incident again lmao
i think im tweking but her voice sounds more high pitched
I can’t wait to play her      I don’t even have the guarantee 🥹🥹
Navia stealing my heart every second she's on screen. I had the biggest smile on my face the entire time.
Navia will never stop being ICONIC
where free 5 star
Я думал что это Better Call Saul Theme в конце
My wife looks beautiful today as well.
She is so lovely
Such a playful demo, will def pull for rerun. My funds are currently drained 😭
if only the game was actually like this trailer
Damn Charlotte at 0:46.
ong navia is so perfect😂
ITS GIVING GIRLBOSS! ITS GIVING TANGO! ITS GIVING MOTHER!!!!
1:37 🤣🤣🤣🤣omg
you can see charlotte at the background in 0:46
Mommy mommy 🗣️ 🔥
Belleza, elegancia, persistencia y Fortaleza, que hermoso personaje es Navia Esa escena con Lynette, jaja aparte de todo divertida
I just came
<3
Bad Blood 💥😎🔥
Why is this trailer so goofy
Even more reason to pull her
I love Navia since the archon quest and I really like design, plus her attacks are so fabulous just like her SHE SLAAYYED🤩💅💅
01:40 "Please boss, put your umbrella away....." made me laugh.😂😂
She's has been one of my favorite Fontaine characters since she was introduced, dang if Yoimiya wasn't on the banner list I'd pull for her in a heartbeat.
I like the elements in this demo SO MUCH!! Comedy + Action is truly a golden combination   AS FUTURE NAVIA MAIN...I HOPE MY FELLOW NAVIA WANTERS WILL GET HOME SAFE AND SOUND and protect her, just as we promised to Melus & Silver 🤎💛🤍
Miy lindo trailer ❤ ya tiraré por ti Navia
Her demo is just an Action Movie with chase scene… LOVE IT
I have to stay strong for Father
TAYLOR SWIFTTTTT
The Godmother  From Francis Fontaine Coppola
SHE IS SO PRETTYYYYYY OMG PULLING FOR HER
Let us Engulf ourselves on how cute she is & looks so cool with her sunglasses! 🥰 her voice is adorable too 😣😵‍💫💛
❤❤
Yall dont forget that she in heels rn💀
What a queen👑 Even Perfection is an understatement for her smh
That thief should've been me not him 😭
That bass be slappin
Those shades😎
SLAAAYYYY!!! SLAY!!
Itto took his vision and defeated soldiers in inazuma and getting captured while navia is something else... captured treasure hoarder and not begin captured 😭
Genshin impact casually dropping best transitions ever
Man that theif so cool NGL I hope he get away lol.
navia has the designs of a sea shanty, royalty and a guard
ended every other geo character, I fear! 🎉🎉🎉
I prefer song in 4.3 trailer more
One of the best Non-Archon demos so far! The "camera work" in some of the chase scenes was so good!! 👏👏👏
Im sorry, did she just outrun her men in heals and a dress? xD
Who else saw Charlotte in this demo? ⬇️
i need someone to use her demo in an edit 😭🫶
Poggers.
I love fontaine characters music
Love the Spanish guitar 💛 Navia is so pretty
SHES SO GIRLBOSS!!! good luck to everyone pulling for her!
Cool girls dont look at explosions.
Bro got beat at five different places in Fontaine 😂😂
SHE'S SO ICONIC. GIRLBOSS. QUEEN. MOTHER. GODESS. OH MY GODDDDDDDD AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
The character card interruption tho omg:   *Running after a legit criminal*  "Going somewhere?" 🌂:D✨
I absolutely love her design. One of my favorite in the entire game. Massive props to the design team.
I'm looking forward to her story quest, even tho act 2 felt like it was navias story quest lol
Her voice changed so much, for the worse, that's sad. okay now imma gonna go watch zhongli demo again
i hear, is that.. proZD?
2:12 Better Call Saul jumpscare
imma commit a war crime just so she can chase me like this, bye guys it's nice to know y'all
Fav demo so far, can’t wait to pull for her!
i like how u see Navia and you're like "oh pretty accent umbrella" and then you realize it's a gun..
Lynette 😂😂
I've hold on too long fot Ningguang, onky for her to be replaced by another queen 💛💛💛 Geo ladies never disappoint
OKAY I NEED HER
Hoping she glides by using umbrella not the usual wings
the level of character animation is similar to Yoimiya/Nahida, dang she looks amazing
It's finally time for Geo to get its first new unit since Yun Jin in 2.4, nearly two years ago.
Absolutely just LOVING Navia oh my gosh, she's just amazing XD this was so fun to watch ahaha
BANGERRRRRRRRRRRRRR
0.46 you can see charlotte here😂
Mafioso💀💀
4 navias ulting at the same time is gonna give someone ptsd 😭
i dont give any thoughts for pulling navia, but sure she has a pretty visual but also beautiful voice i love her now..
Iré por Navia y después con momy Shogun Raiden gracias al pity exclusivo del targeton.  Xd.
better call saul chord 2:11
Such a fun demo, I live for Navia
I might only have 30 pulls but goddammit I’m still gonna pull for this woman
YES.
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH WOAH. (3 years since kaeyas demo,  the improvements are insane)
Best character design, best visual, best heels, best shades, best dress, best guards, best color, best girl
How do I skip this...
save me white girl
Bruh this gave me serious Trigun vibes! So excited for her
YEAH NAVIA
Im currently taking a break and havent even started the fontaine archon quest but keep seeing furina and lyney everywhere on roblox, but i might return JUST for her lol.
She's got a gunbrella!
shes so pretty .. she will be one of the prettiest girl of fontaine
no way they gave her a "portrait" of the suspect, sir, y'all have the same face and body since Mondstandt
IS THAT PROZD?
Come home early pleeeeease navia
It was a good chase
tanto a música quanto a Navia em si ficaram maravilhosas! ^^ espero conseguir pegar ela, já juntei mais de 100 desejos só pra ela kk
Oh no, I might actually pull for her
Navia is so elegant
1:53 PLEASE, that theme really do be fitting here, it show that navia story revolve around the main story so much  Really mu favorite part from the demo alongside Lynette appearance
1hour ago
Feel like GTA naVIa 😅
NAVIA!!!!!! the entire concept of this demo, the action movie-esque chase sequence, is so perfect for her. the animation in this was just crazy good!! might be one of my favourite hyv animations ever. it's all so dramatic and so comedic and i absolutely LOVED navia walking away from that explosion with her shades on, she's the coolest of all time ?!?! can't wait to pull for her, may all navia wanters be havers!!! 💗✨
Why u guys always change a good theme music to a worst version of itself......this is as same as wriothesly's case  Presented a good theme in 4.3 trailer  then took it, maked a bad version of it and made that her theme🤦🤦.
Taylor Sheesh left no crumbs 😔💅✨️
That treasure hoarder is hunted hard
Very nice trailer the Animation was whimsical and vibrant. I can't wait for Navia! ❤❤❤
Navia ❌️ Navia Swift ✅️
I was in awe and smiling the whole time
omg i was interally screaming when i saw this i cant wait to pull for her
60 FPS LESGOOOOOO NAVIA CREW
NAVIA WILL COME HOME
SERVED
Your honor, she’s the prettiest woman in the game 😭😭💐
Sangat elegan ❤
"Manners maketh man. Do you know what that means? _Then let me teach you a lesson."_ —Navia
No silver and meluse 😢. Also she's geo, less than 10% people are getting her. Hoyoverse, you could've made her the Dr. Ratio of Genshin, players would've been very happy, but you don't want us to be happy.
2:11 For a moment I thought that Saul Goodman's theme will start playing 😂
AAAH IDK! I WANNA WISH FOR NAVIA BUT I NEED TO SAVE FIR RAIDEN SHOUGUN!! HELP WHAT DO I DO 😭😭
I’m tempted, but I’m holding out until Arlecchino.
Taylor Swift -but- and she's Geo
is it just me, or is her voice way higher than it was in the archon quest...?
>guns and roses character  >theme isnt rock. A shame, thats the only thing im dissatisfied with.
Treasuer horder : " oh nice view ❤" 2:14
if you slow down the video and pause at 0:46, you can see Charlotte
Navia pullers come here
The so called thief the Spina di Rosula was after just so happens to show up right in front of them leading to a chase scene. Classic and hilarious. It's practically a scene from your classic cartoons and for all you know Furina could be filming this whole thing and everyone would see it as normal and that WOULD BE NORMAL!
You know what this reminde me of Neo from RWBY
WHO TOLD HER SHE CAN WALLRUN
Navia, is without a doubt, the main character
_"Umm Boss, I think we need to get him to a Doctor first"_ Dr.Ratio: _"And that's where I come in.."_  😎
I sorry but putting it on 2× speed is so goofy 😂
NO NAVIA DONT OUTDO ALL OF GEO LIKE THAT-
mami from madoka lives on in navia
it feels like she's on modelling photoshoot everytime she's in a battle, with the umbrella and the sunglasses 😂😂 it's fun to watch
Fontaine Characters's demos are amazing
I'm gonna pull for her no matter what... 💪
Dis guy really fight the wrong woman I’m even surprised he still alive at the end 😂
i'm.. i'm... PULLING!!!!
is this dps
idk man...her English VA sounds childish...😅
I didn't see the title and thought the character demo was for the theif at the start.
They never miss with the music do they
The queen of being extra in the best way possible
Plankton: Wait where did you get that Cannon
I've never screenshot so many shots 😆
Give a shoutout to Charlotte 0:46 for being at the right place at the right time. 😚
Is it just me, or does it feel like she’s the one who’s guarding her bodyguards?
Hoyo you MUST make a glider that is her umbrella
How does she run so fast with that dress?
ЛИННЕТ КИНН
NOW THATS A REAL AMERICAN!
Did they changed her voice? It was like more mature before. Now its high pitched.
It ain't no dr ratio I ain't coming back
I want ayaka
Geo Queen❤❤❤
I can’t be the only one who thinks her design, character and charm is similar to Johnny from guilty gear right? I mean they both have a lot of similarities.  Both are bosses of a crew  Both have a ship  Both have sick sunglasses.  I can’t be the only one right?
Navia god ven a casaaa
😍😍😍
Charlotte really is a journalist. She is almost everywhere 😂😂
What would have been more amazing, is if she had used her umbrella as a glider instead of the normal ones. Like, I wanted to see her go full Mary Poppins, but nevertheless this character is absolutely amazing.
MAY ALL NAVIA WANTERS, BE NAVIA HAVERS!! SENDING GOOD LUCKS!!
Navia is honestly such a queen! She is honestly what an ideal boss should be. She slays so hard without even trying.
Why is it the fact im kinda agreeing on the treasure hoarder Stealing
pleeeeaaaaseee make her run with her umbrella trailing behind, and ik its impossible but she would look so cool gliding with an umbrella
She looks very nice, but I'd be a fool to roll for her with Geo in the state that it is, and they already fooled me once with Itto.
I love navies design it’s so pretty I am defiantly pulling😂
Meta this meta that HAVE YOU MET A GIRL THIS BADDDDD?
OKAY THE GUITAR STRINGS IN THE MUSIC IS LIT I'M SOLD I'M PULLING
I must stay strong for raiden
Ojou Sama❤
КОРОЛЕВА
Like always navia, Strong like a rock, spice like chili but soft like a pastry and beautiful like a flower 🥰🥰
I wanted her so bad... But I'm so low on gems...
yo shoutout ProZD!
so hoyoverse can forget about geo characters for another years again
MY QUEEN❤ HOW ARE YOU SO BEAUTIFUL 😭😭😭😭 PLEASE STEP ON ME😭😭
SHES LITERALY SO CUTE DOES SHE WANNA KISS ME???
3y ago Mar 17 2020
Now idk if I want her or Raiden 😭
So I was going to pull for Raiden. But these past days I have realised just how much of a chad  Navia is. So take my garantee Navia and give me a pair of sunglasses.
Bro navia is crazy at parkour
She's so cool! And elegant! Good luck on her banner, everyone!
Naviazzzzzzzzzz
M'lady
I believe Navia is Kingsman member
Two words amazing 5 star
WE ARE EATING TONIGHT
THE DEMO IS JUST A CHEFS KISS, music, action, a bit of humor. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY NAVIA💛💛💛💛⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🌟🌟🌟🌟
Wow ❤❤❤
New bodyguard😢
I do not believe she is running that fast with those heels
My favorite demo used to be the klee demo, but I think this is my new favorite one I like the chaos.
hài hước y hệt trailer của itto
FS too much
NOOO IM AN HOUR LATE
1:55 Archon fights on the side with the best artillery
Смотрел ради Линетт
Did I just heard Saul Goodman???? i thought she was Taylor Swift
Chasos 😂
Maximum Girl Boss & Ojou-sama vibes! 😎
0:42 white
Back when I used to play brawl stars, I remember a brawler named Piper. Navia’s way of fighting is surely inspired from her.
2:13 Looking respectfully
why her voice sounds different? it's like a pitch higher.
Navia about to hit the 1st spot
Ya all waiting for her banner right I want her in geo girl team
Navia obby master
She's actually an otome isekai protagonist lmao. She even got the flowers on the borders and everything when she was posing and slaying
Navia? No, its yelan 4.3 version🙏
the ending is like this :Wake the f*** up, Samurai. We have a city to burn.
Finally a second gal to open my heart
Damn, not only this little princess has a heart of gold and leadership of a real family head but the athletics of a champion.  She's so much.
Lynette part was awsome
Why is her voice so high pitched now
When you want Navia but havent unlocked Fontaine yet.
Navia is so beautiful but also so gangsta at the same time. Totally love her <3
I honestly thought that Navia would just artillery strike the boat the thief was on. I wish that would happen…
spoilers           rip melus and silver
God she’s so cool
NAVIAAA SHES FINALLY HERE 4.0 WANTERS RISE
Man, the temptation to pull for her and not supposedly future Arlechinno is big.
I am so in love with her right now 😍
Very good character but the 4.3 gb gonna make me playing impossible. sorry genshin, i'll forget you for star rail.
Sold! I will speedrun every exploration for you just to get Navia and her Weapon <3
Taylor Swift
Cool bosses don't look at explosions
Geo Mommy Ningguang's daugthers sure are classy 😁
Damn girl is broke in lore, but this demo scream budget
Best trailer so far
We getting better demo’s each patch. Looking forward to Xianyun’s
MELUS AND SILVER WOULD BE SO PROUD OF THIS DEMO 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I personally wont be going for her but GL to those who do! Design for her is PEAK quality, Just too bad shes GEO
Why does this game STILL not have triple banners? They made double banners a long time ago and it’s only common sense at this point to make triple banners so we don’t have to wait 3 years for a rerun… There’s way too many characters in game for double banners
The famous girl of the school bulling the shy kid….
I HATE THAT MELUS AND SILVER ARE NOT IN HERE  (Btw really good demo)
Hoyoverse went all out for our Queen Navia, but seriously I love her design and voice, it fits really well for her and I love her personality, omg she’s the sweetest   I Can’t Wait To Pull For Her, Hope all Navia Wanters be Navia Havers 💛💛💛
that was incredible
her design is just pure class and beauty !
Hey just think what if the umbrella is the glider only for her tho
Charlotte and Lynette cameo nice
This organization is just like a criminal syndicate in some world quests but only funny dudes when they are with Navia.
I'd rather play as the thief, he seems kinda cool.
This one was kinda eh tbh. Navia is just going sonic the hedgehog just for 1 guy
i will forever find it funny on how we thought she would use her umbrella, as something like wanderers elemental skill. but she ends up using it as a shotgun💀
1:40 Lmao, the two guys trying to stop her umbrella from going inside out😂  Also the level of quality in this demo is insane🤯🤩
NAVIA SOOO COOL SHE IS MY MOM!!!❗️❤️‍🔥
I LOVE YOU MY GODDESS NAVIA AHHHHHHHHHH
So much movement in one is always the best!

"boss please put your umbrella away!" "No. I gotta look  ~✨💖 FABULOUS💖✨~ "
please kiss me
For being the only playable character who wears sunglasses, her eyes are very sparkly.
If it takes her that long to kill a treasure hoarder then I'm concerned for her dps. /s (hope Geo is good again)
Someone must have had fun animating that chasing scene.
00:00 Start 2:12 Saul Goodman 2:30 End
Bombs away!!!!!!
I need it
Glad they finally tried to give geo a little boost finally. Step in the right direction
I love how that this trailer shows how extravagant Navia is,  like she's got a whole reloadable gunbrella, an AXE, and she summons a BUNCH OF MASSIVE CANNONS just to deal with this one guy. And to top it all off she's got SUNGLASSES. Now Navia requesting a ten meter tall tophat from Chiori makes sense now!
She's gorgeous
These Fontaine characters are pretty cool, even Taylor swift 😅
Axe, guns and cannons,   Yes it's haru from persona 5 LOL
LONG LIVE NAVIA!!!!! I LOVE HER SO MUCH
I'm getting you, yellow lady!!! 💛💛💛
OMG TAYLOR SWIFT YOU'RE SLAYING HERE😭😭
What is this?! I love her so much! She's awesome and independent girl😎
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA NAVIA I’M GAY BUT I ALWAYS TURN STR8 BECAUSE OF YOU AAAAAAAAAAAA
This is giving me power pamplona vibes
She is a dps?
Navia in this trailer is just so wholesome. Sending luck to those who will pull for her.
When android suport gamepad,?
GENSHIN COULD NEVER
2:11 Saul Goodman???
Mid af
She’s sooooo prettyyyy
I need that umbrella
FREE DR RATIOOO
Saving for cloud retainer was tempting but after these, Taylor swift is coming home❤️❤️
NAVIAAAA
She's got more animations in this pv than what you'll ever be able to see after paying for and playing in game
2:12 BETTER CALL SAUL, am i crazy?)))
i want to pull for her because this trailer looked so cool 😭😭
your ruined her amazing voice she had in Archon Story.....
MY QUEEN OMG
Great! It’s happy that you guys finally remembered that there is an element called geo.
Nah, Genshin! I should go to school😭
PULLING HER THO😂
is that... ProZD?
I miss Melus and Silver sm bro
The Six Kalima (Arabic: ٱلكَلِمَات ٱلسِتّ‎ al-kalimāt as-sitt, also spelled qalmah), also known as the Six Traditions or the Six Phrases, are six Islamic phrases ...
Eeeeee I really want her but I really m saving
I am so sad that Silver and Melsus isn’t with her
Better Call Navia
not free 5 Star , Dame... 😆
Гео, фи:)
My queen !!!!
navia is the prettiest lady in genshin and no one can change my mind
2:12 AIN'T NO WAY SAUL GOODMAN THEME 💀
geo......................................................
I’m reconsidering skipping her. Idk what I want 😭
Imagine instead of using the wings to glide, she uses a parasol....
My wife.
This one is SO GOOD. I really laughed at this one, specially the umbrella being held while they were full speed ahead on that boat
My 2nd favourite <33!
They saw the fits raiden/ayaka trailer rumors and got to WORK
Quite literally a girlboss
She is such a queen! 👑
WHYYYYY 00:48 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
She can fix me
2:12 Saul Goodman intro lmao
Okay okay I’ll pull for her

Slay Queen
Taylor Swift when become playable:
Bro, she is her.
White woman save me.
WHY DOES NAVIA REMIND ME OF MAMI TOMOE
I hope her story quest has Taylor Swift references 🥺
ptm me vengo!!!!!!
Me> Navia look so cute😍 Me again> she's look like a deadly cannon😨😰😱 rip that guy
Navia, te amo
Idrila, is that you?
Playable Taylor swift
God bless her bro
Navia has a cute voice, didn't really get to come out in the archon quest because she was like always depressed or crying or angry.
eu tava em dúvida se ia skipar a navia pra pegar a retentora, mas depois desse vídeo, eu n tenho dúvidas que vou pegar a navia
I love how Lynette helped navia especially with the fact she also wishes to be friends with her to
I can't stop smiling knowing I'm gonna have a guaranteed pull! Let's Go Navia! come home!
Also, I miss Rosaria... ;_; (this reminded me of her)
"Boss you just shot the crook!"  "Okay, and?"
Assassin Creed: Fontaine
2:16 I love how she pulls the glasses down 🥰 definitely a must pull, been wanting her since 4.0
MY LADYYYYY
Geo Taylor Swift
0:45 a wild Charlotte detected
Piper from brawl stars
She. Is. Badass.
Waiting few more days before pulling so she can join my team at Christmas
i can’t explain how much i love this character. literally, she’s gorgeous, beautiful and has a great personality, she’s the best.
Beautiful never a disappointment from genshin impact lol

I bet Omegaevolution is gonna spend a LOT of money to pull this banner to summon Navia.😂
In terms of physics, she's holding the umbrella the wrong way to catch up
I must stay strong for the Shogun. I must.
Taylor Swift 🥰
My god the music. I always love a good non-electric guitar instruments!
She so.
A bit weird they changed Rosula members calling of Navia from Demoiselle to Boss all of a sudden. It used to be as Demoiselle both in previous video and in the Archon quest. I was thinking in previous video that other members just followed Menus and Silver's habit.
Gonna skip but hoyo really knows how to make a trailer
"Cool girls don't look at explosions!" Nice one!
Hahaha... Its so funny concept i like this trailer
Willing to risk it all for her ❤❤❤
I really hope there is way for us to see the sunglasses in game. Maybe it's a part of her E skill, as an idle animation, heck maybe make it exclusive to photo mode, that would be pretty funny imo.  Just anything please because she looks too good in those shades for us to not see it in game!!
navia is the most beautiful woman in genshin with yoimiya
is it just me or is her voice higher???
An Umbrella, Axe and Cannons?? Navia's design is actually so cool
Navia is the definition of if the police did their job except she gives me mafia vibes. Also whoever designed her WOW juts WOW its brilliant 👏
For those who pulls for Navia, I wish you all good luck. I will save my primogems for Xianyun, so I leave the luck for pulling Navia to you all.
I need 2:01 as a wallpaper
Lynette helped them to point at it & it was so cool, then i'd really wonder why her weapon is different because at 4.0; it is different than a sword & maybe probably she'd really pick up or Melus or Sliver gave to her
The video was really cool but I have to say something after recent events with HSR, I really feel like Genshin doesn't appreciate their own players and takes them for granted, HSR has been out for 8 months now and our 3 year anniversary pales in comparison, you end up adding QoL features you should've added years ago and hopes us to be satisfied with that, is beyond disrespectful to people who've so loyal to you
And all of this while wearing heels
просто сэкс
My pretty girl ❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊
Woof Woof
Bruh the guardes need a tighter grip on these guardemeks, how the heck did this gooofy npc treasure hoarder get one?😂
so umbrella, shotgun or Axe??
I need navia also oml but the way she did the zhongli kicking his Polearm reference i love it, but Lynette appearing was also cool
Did she just curb stomp that guy?
0:45 Is that Charlotte I see?
PLEASE MAKE HER UMBRELLA A GLIDER 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
These demo’s are just getting better and better
MY LADYYYYY
2:19 A rumor says he will never wake up again, cuz with that view angle, he saw something he shouldn't have seen
MY GIRLFRIEND
YIPPPIEEE 🎉🎉🎉
45 MINUTESTE AGO
I SCREAM OUT OF MY LUNGS
Her selfie moment at the end omg
I NEED HER
I LOVE HER SO MUCH PLS COME HOME NAVIA🥹🧎‍♀️🫶🏻💗
Genshin's editors are top-notch and this is an amazingly edited video, but I did want to know that the editing this time was a little slower and less flashy than usual, which feels more sluggish and heavy, like navies claymore attacks
0:35 she said “going somewhere”, I forgot who else from characters says that, I’m getting deja vu😭
mafia boss ka
I’ve never spent $150 dollars so quickly
💀
Navia best girl (⁠◍⁠•⁠ᴗ⁠•⁠◍⁠)⁠❤
Ate and devoured
Love the ending lol!
Woww
For a detective, she sure is shady
0:54 Navia: Hey there! let's go outside of the city and fight
OMG NAVIA U DONT HAVE TO END ALL OTHER GEO CHARACTERS LIKE THAT😵
Okey I change my mind iam pulling for her
Boss 🛐
i cant wait to hear about gaming haha
Never in my life have I ever rewatched a character demo. I usually watch once and move on. But omg I love the cinematics so much. Like the slow motion in the beginning, the running on the walls, the drop down from above. I wasn't even planning to pull for her at all and this might be the first time a demo makes me want to pull for a character!! 💛🤍
Good luck everyone pulling for her, treat her well. 💖
It is sooo sad that Next Banner is my Raiden Shogun 😢😢😢so I cant Pull for Navia bcs I want to get my Raiden and C2 with her weapon ❤
So ELEGANT yet so DEADLY!!
Where is our mc aether ❤
One of the best demos indeed
need her
Waifu tactica

We got spanish mami in genshin
So?? IS HER UMBRELLA GONNA BE ALSO THE GLIDER??
Noelle mains finally winning new artifacts

rwby character vibes
The animation and transitions are as hot as Navia! 😎
Who gave Fontainians the right to have such AMAZING demos??
some say she was Mary Poppins in her past life
ALAMIERRRRRRDAAAAAA
She’s so cool 🥹
damn i want her, but i still want raiden too :)
NAVIA NCAU NACIA MVAI ANVAIA OMG
สวยมากค่ะ คุณหนูนาเวีย 💛💛💛 มาเยี้ยมไอดีเราด้วยนะคะ
Awesome Genshin Impact "Navia: Unofficial Operation" Character Demo Video.
Navia wanters will be Navia havers!!! Our queen is coming, the best Fontaine character alongside Furina and Neuvillette 💛🧡🖤
STOP RIGHT THERE
Navia's incredibly athletic! From running to performing parkor.
I thought navia was supposed to be a noble because of her design or a politician because of her father's influence. It turns out she's probably based of the french mafia which makes sense for the underground headquarters and the men in suit underlings
I love her... But yeah, totally excited for her
How tf she can runs in heels that fast T-T
You can't tell me she isn't Mary Poppins😭
I love her so much
Funny how navia’s demo makes me like Lynette more
That thief is so smart  Manages to run straight into them
0:20 "It was at this moment, he knew, he fu@ked up."
HEY BODYGUARDS DON'T CALL HER DEMOISELLE ANYMORE, THEY CALL HER BOSS ༼⁠;⁠´⁠༎ຶ⁠ ⁠۝ ⁠༎ຶ⁠༽ We will forever miss you, Melus and Silver. 😞
Slaying with sunglasses
What is Lynette doing there drinkng tea😂
Navia chwan😍
i'm so sad she is a big sword user....the only reason i'm skiping her...
UAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Yeah people skipping her are dumb.
Must need navia for my Konosuba Team
nooo honestly i liked her voice during the archon quest, not this high pitched sh*t
Just release the anime already!
GOD they better put some kinda floating umbrella SOMETHING ANYTHING
# remembermelusandsilver
☂"Please boss, put your umbrella away!" 😂🤣
Here before this hit 100k views😭 (feels like a rare gem even though I know nobody cares)
WOAHH
Bonito
SHE'S SO COOOL
I can Imagine navia instead of using the glider she uses here umbrella to fly 😂
IM IN LOVE
Im gonna tickle my pickle to this
Ok then, I'm on 50:50 I'll try to pull her tommorow, only 10 pull away to get 5 star. If  She come home I'll be happy but if I lose I'll still feel happy, that mean Cloud Retainer guarantee to come home.
Umbrella Sword, Umbrella Sword, Umbrella Sword,
I was rooting for the thief more 😂
Geo mains are winning with this fabulous queen! 👑
She's such a thug life <3 love her
Its not the same Without Melus and Silver 😢😭 now she cooks her own macaroons 😭😭😭
Her theme soundtrack is so good!!
Taylor Swift❤
wtf did they do to her voice
Those beat drops are godly
1:06 She's so smug... I love it!
It would be really cool if Navia can glide with her umbrella.
I can already hear mina's giggles from this one
Unexpected Lynette cameo! 0:50 also is that the place she was standing on during the Final Feast trailer?! That’s so cool.
Es la mejor demo que he visto en mucho tiempo JAJAJA
navia pretty
IS ME GIRL IN FONTAINE ❤
Holy production quality, Batman! Those animations were sick!
It would be fun and unique if she glided with her umbrella vs wings
Okay the demo isn't over the top but the smooth animation of them running is enough
Navia is undoubtedly the most beautiful character in the game.  Her stunning beauty radiates from the tip of her toes to her head; every pixel of this character exudes excellence, magnificence, and ecstasy to anyone who sees her. She possesses an exquisite beauty that penetrates even the core of the most discerning women enthusiast; her bold personality is the sublime touch that allows her to express unparalleled perfection.  I would write an epic for this woman; I would tattoo her all over my body; I would acquire the copyright to her character just to make her my official wife. We should thank every day for the birth of the astute virtuoso who meticulously conceived her, who reached the pinnacle within her niche, who prolifically created the magnum opus of 2D characters.  I'll get her, even if I have to spend the month eating rice, beans, and meat every day for lunch, even if I delay my bills, even if I have to forgo the basic fundamental principles of being a human.
loving this new taylor swift music video
loved her in the quest. she’s actually one of my favorite characters. she reminds me of fischl a bit (if fischl was normal /j).
All Hail the queen that is Navia 🙏💖💖
I'm getting some serious Vill-V vibes for some reason
God she is just such a beautiful strong woman. I love her! Her ost sounds like a 2D jump'n run level. ❤
So happy to see navia's new bodyguards Belus and Gold
Thats one durable umbrella૮ ⚆ﻌ⚆ა
A teylor aí kkkk
That jump to the ground, she learned from childe.
Lol, love the comedic way they identified the thief from the beginning. Might be one of my favorite demos yet with how action packed it is!
hoyo cooked with furina and navia's demo
Lynette be MVP when they were chasing sea shadow.
Geo Girl Boss is almost here and I am waiting!  She just looks better every time!  May all of us Navia wanters become havers!
Navia is like a good mafia boss also she has a very good design
MANNNN SHES SO FUN, MAKES ME WANNA COME BACK......
1:55 Chev and Navia really bringing the *_AMERICAN SPIRIT 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸_* in Fontaine
They're just flexing their cinematography at this point. And I'm all for it.
Where my swifties at?? LET'S GO TAYLOR SWIFT!!! 💛💛💛
lynette!!!
What a freakin' GIRLBOSS, OMG!! GOOD LUCK ON YOUR PULLS, NAVIA WANTERS WILL BE NAVIA HAVERS!! 💛
NAVIA PLEASE COME HOME
The next 24hrs will feel like 24 months.. I WANT HER NOW
God I love this, her demo is so dynamic and fun, good luck to y'alls Navia pulls!
ily Navia
And she does it all in high heels.
IM ALREADY IN LOVE
I feel bad for the guy
For someone wearing a full, frilly dress and stilettos, Navia can keep up with and run rather fast. If that ain't talent, I don't know what is...
If the sword gets too old, navia has a cannon against robots. This is the proper send off.
POV: You’re here early
its peak
2:11 thought better call Saul was about to start lmao
HER THEME IS SO GOOD. Oh please let me luck me good so I can get her
❤
lmaoo i love this demo😭
I like this 👍😂
2:14 He Saw How Fat the 🐱Was And Fainted
36 MINS AGO 🤯
I know people try to compare Narvia to the Mafia.  But they're totally the Pinkerton Detective Agency.  😅
Inesperadamente una muy buena demo, 0:00 sale meme de Better Call Saul?
Coolest demo wthhhh! I’m addicted to it omggg
0:46 You can see Charlotte in the background as minor detail. 😂
Melus and Silver would be proud of Navia right now
Despite losing her loved ones time and time again, she is still the brightest sunshine. No wonder she's Geo instead of Anemo. She keeps persevering.
u know guys?? that's my wife
shes the one
ME SALE NAVIA GRACIAS GRACIAS GRACIAS GRACIAS GRACIAS 🍀🕯️💚🤞🏻 GRACIAS PORQUE TENGO A NAVIA GRACIAS GRACIAS GRACIAS GRACIAS GRACIAS 🍀🕯️💚🤞🏻
that enemy could be me
SHE  ATE SHE ATE SHE ATE SHE ATE SHE ATE SHE ATE ATE ATE ATE THIS UPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
She is elegant and beautiful and powerful at the same time
Demoiselles don't look at explosions.
VELHO QUE LINDAAAAAA
She's effortlessly fabulous and silly chasing criminals with that heels, shades and an umbrella. Love her. Melus and Silver will be missed! The new bodyguards are funny too
Her voice is so lovely
xinyan on fontaine when?
I love how much more expressive the demos have gotten over the years. This demonstrates Navia’s non depressed personality perfectly.
This demo is so action-packed! What the hell. I love Navia so much!
WE STAN I REPEAT WE STAN
She looks cool! Love the shades!
Good luck everyone on her banner!
เจ้เมืองคอนพร้อมลูกซอง!!!
Navia is the Kingsman agent, she has umbrella gun
As much as I miss Melus and Silver, those 2 dudes also look reliable and frankly a little hot so I'll let it...
That tiro finale. Shes gonna lose her head aint she.
RAAAAAAAAAH MY QUEEN WHAT AN ABSOLUTE UNIT YOU ARE 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
i loved the chasing part so much. everything in this trailer fit so well
uh what.
Should I be concerned sins if I remember correctly the thing her father gave her was the SHOTGUN UMBRELLA to a child?
SHE LOOKS AMAZING
I absolutely love this. Now THAT is how you show off a character. 10/10.
a total sweetheart with a heart of gold and gold skills set.
As someone who isn't a navia simp, her demo is very good
She is so talented, that she can make anything she does seem so stylish!
Oh danggg. Guitar? Unreal Dreamer gonna love ths
I love her design but I don’t have enough primos 😢
THIS DEMO IS GONNA BE THE MOST WATCHED CHARACTER DEMO AFTER RAIDEN SHOGUN AND ZHONGLI.. SHE'S SO BADASS 🔥🔥 I want to pull for her but i am saving for raiden shogun so unfortunately i have to skip her banner 🥲. I have 112 intertwined fates tho.
New Best Girl 😔❤
No Melus & Silver 😭 In memoriam.
She is such a mood!! For all those wishing in her banner, may the odds be ever in our favour.
Challenge: trying not to use Techno in every Character Demo Hoyo-Mix makes  Hoyo-Mix: impossible  But for real, every Demo after yu-peng Chen left, except for Lynettes, heavily dipped into or was completely techno/electro style. I feel like the more orchestral approach (they still use it much but much rarer) was what made it stand out from for example Star Rail Demos. And Star Rail is sci fi.
Awesome 🥰👍😎
– Навия такая обворожотильная. Мне нравится как она показана в трейлере, но крутить еë я скорее всего не буду ^^
I HAVE 40 PULLS SO FAR, GIVE HER TO ME PLEASE I BEG OF YOU
i'm skipping but may all navia wanters be navia havers 🙏🏻
I love rocks, PULLLLLLLLLLLL!
GEO ERA IS COMING!!!
I've been waiting for this demo!! This is so beautiful
Damn, Boats in Fontaine are insanely fast, with that size moving like speedboat
She is a fusion between Daisy and Peach as a Pirates of the Caribbean character. It would be nice if she could glide in the air like Peach, but with her parasol instead. xD
Rip Sea-Shadow, he tried his best till the very end
Perhaps she could have safe open world talent like venti which can float longer while gliding
boring demo and song
They upped their demo game so much since fontaine
Perona horo horo horo 👻
Neh not worth my protos, let the feeble simps feed and waste their resources on her🥱
Melus and Silver protected Navia even beyond death. They have completed their duties. They will always be forever remembered. Rest well Melus and Silver, as both of you shall remain as legends and heroes for all of eternity. 🫡
Imagine if they implemented Parkour like this
Mafia Impact
Petition for Navia to use her gunbrella to glide instead of a normal glider 🤌🏻🤌🏻
2:13
Hi Navia
Fontaine trailers have been top tier NAVIA ILY!!
Her colors, her design, her personality. I loved everything about her. Navia is so beautiful.
2:11 Better Call Saul
0:55 giving me street fighter vibes for no reason
I'm very impressed with the character animation in Genshin lately, very detailed eye movement to show emotion and personality. Wow!
Top
Awesome demo for an awesome character. Was nice to see Lynette in there as well.
A: lynnette was proving she's definitely one of the best cat girls in anime with her reactions to what was going on. B:there's going to tons of memes extremely soon coming from this.   And finally,  c: yes, melusand silver will be missed,  by everyone in the community,  including myself.  But the most important thing to keep in mind that navia is probably the most likeable person in Fontaine rn, at least for us gamers.   She's the type of person anyone,  gay or not,  would love to be around
MVP of fontaine right here
I can’t wait she will be useful in a crystalize team 😊
kinda like her theme song that play on the live stream more, oh well good fun animation. Cheers fellow spina de macarons lets win 50/50 tmr!
That treasure hoarder just drove right by and then he gets chased by everyone
Murica Taylor Swift
Man, Navia and Diluc need to chase criminals together, if only for the contrast of how bright and cheerful one is and how dour and serious the other is.  Also...  MELUS AND SILVER WILL LIVE FOREVER! Rejoice, you two, your Demoiselle is thriving.
Shes so cool and badass🥺🥹🥹🥹
Omg Navia you are so cool I think this is one of the biggest hits genshin impact is gonna ever release like ever thank you thank you I cannot appreciate you enough navia you are so amazing talented special skilled my jaw dropped and you can fit a whole umbrella in there I am very shocked very pleasantly surprised goodness wow what I would do to witness her in action I would never be the same actually I have changed permanently and my brain has shifted due to this video navia please come home .
The queen flinging her umbrella like a queen 💅👑
SHES SO BEAUTIFUL AND FUNNY I LOVE HER
Navia needs to be deeply appreciated for managing to catch a thief in HIGH HEELS
Can't wait for Navia. I've already prefarmed for her
Too bad she is not a free 5*. Genshin could never be so generous as Honkai Star Rail.
Navia after bringing back Geo and being the first 5* Geo Women
YES NAVIA SLAYYYYY Her demo is so pretty!! Goodluck Navia wanters! <3  Lynette’s little appearance was so cute haha
😀😀😀
I can't wait to play her!!
NAVIA WANTERS WILL BE NAVIA HAVERS
This is some Childe level fooling. Dang. With all that jumping.
Love Navia sm, she’s honestly so underrated and in my opinion one of the best written characters in story 😍🥰🤩
Ok but like what did they do to her voice why is it so much higher now
As a F2P player, this is the hardest skip of my life 😭 Best of luck to everyone going for her, though! May Navia-Wanters be Navia-Havers
EU NASCI DESSA DEMO MEU DEUS
Animator: So how well animated and smooth do you want Navia's PV to be? Hoyoverse: *YES*
Is there a reason why her voice sounds so high pitched???
Navia went HARD against this poor rando ahahaha
I so want to pull for Navia, but sadly I'm saving for Raiden😭
Let us Navia mains never forget Melus and Silver <33
Ee
New 5 star weapon the “umbrella”😂
NAVIA, COME HOMEE!!!
Le rezo a esta mujer 🛐🛐🛐

Mami vibes is real hahaha
Poor treasure hoarder "sleeps with the fishes" now......😂😂😂
YAYYYYYY
Genshin's demos have gotten so good! The animation is so nice to look at, the chase scene is so badass
0:01 better call navia ?
I skipped furina for her
Gosh! How can she be so beautiful! Genshin went over the top with her character design.
Least flexible Teyvans.
Honestly, I'm not concerned with her meta, she just looks like she will be so much fun to play! And with Rosaria on the same banner, I may finally C6 her too!
Navia saves geo
Yoo the transitions are so clean here!! The trailer is so good 😭😭 good luck to everyone pulling for her! I hope I win my 50/50 :") she's so stunning and I love her character 😭😭  Silver and Melus will always be proud of her. :")
I can't help but fall in love with Navia again and again!

Okay. I'm this sold me. I'm getting her. Au revoir, mofos. 😎☂️
She's so incredible, the demo is just... I don't even have the words!! The animation, the music, the story everything is so funny and pretty, and Navia who is in my opinion the most beautiful character of genshin and my favorite character, what more can I say?!!! I can't wait to pull her !!!! 😌✨✨✨
Господи, какая женщина🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐
navia looks the same as i remember,but where are the chads bodyguards who share the memories
OMG I thought after Furina, nothing could come close, but surprisingly Navia's demo is SO FUN and dynamic, I love it. It's on my top 3 for sure!
Melus and Silver would be so proud...
Fluid animation! As smooth as Furina's fla-
DAMMNNNN, these trailers are just getting better and better. The cinematics in this was mind blowing.
Did anyone notice her voice is higher?!
Navia Queen! 🥰
Comrade Navia🙋
SHE IS BEAUTY SHE IS GRACE SHE WILL KICK YOU IN THE FACE
Am I crazy or does her voice seem higher?
my god, this was such a fun trailer! navia is so beautiful, so gorgeous aaahhhh
Would be fun and new if she uses her umbrella while falling
slay
You know she's the boss when she puts those shades on!  😎
Navia literally went 'GOTTA GO FAST!'
I'm crossing my fingers her "glider" will be this umbrella that we can toggle on or off...💛Been waiting MANY months for this gal! I can't wait to get her!
love her so much T.T
2:11 Saul Goodman cameo
I hope Navia will move on from her past and be happy. She's such a positive character and I love her.
Not the best but still getting her  Has a lotta Itto energy.
so when is the banner? ffs just release her already!
The Rose Queen of Fontaine, she beat her enemy with grace, elegance and overwhelming power!, the mary poppins of guns and cannon! the music and the animation is so good, and the ending is so her, classy!
"Boss put your umbrella away" got me laughing
Taylor Swift es maravillosa 😍
El waos
aiy
I think i hauve covid
Not the best but still getting her
She bout to smack and gun you with an umbrella 💀
ready to blow my 100K primos on her. geo mains have been STARVING
She is so Taylor Swift coded
*inserts specialist*
0:35 dayum such a smooth transition
Love how the two guys are holding her umbrella so it doesn't flip 😆
Navia in Fontaine archon quests: 😢😢😢😭😭😭 Navia in character demo: 😏😃😎💃☂💥
I wish y’all luck
Yay
shes fontaines own superhero, shes even got sidekicks
Navia- going somewhere? Besides jail.
The trailers just keep getting better and better
Holy F-  PARKOUR MASTER NAVIA
Free Zhongli
This is giving me super nostalgia from when the game came out and Noelle was the geo queen!
Nooooooo the difference in her Archon quest voice and the teaser and trailer 😭😭😭
this was so chaotic I LOVED IT YAAASSSS QUEEN NAVIA
I think this is my favorite demo yet!! Good luck to everyone pulling!!
Taking the Napoleon approach I see.  Good stuff.
Damn, she sure isn't beating those Taylor *Swift* allegations is she?
MY PRONOUNS ARE U.S.A.
As a new player, sadly imma skip
Lynette: Tea anyone?🍵
25 mins
*Not bad but skip*
Fontain-style parkour
... okay that chase scene was terrific.  ... and the mix on the theme at 0:53 is PEAK. Absolutely love that.  ... I will be using this track for Victor's Stage in Tekken 8 for sure.
She is such a great character, absolutely love this demo!!!
Me watching this many times because i know to myself i don’t have primos to get her. I’m inhaling the copium rn
Ok I won't be rolling for her cause broke and I know nothing about her as a character but my goodness, I think Navia's the most stylish character in Genshin.
the theme reminds me of professor layton songs
Rodin: "Heh... beautiful!!"
I love her so much
solo un dia mas para tenerla  con nosotros
This demo is like a movie💕 Navia is soo pretty I can't wait to pull for herr
0:46 charlotte better be ready for the chase to get the new news.
better than actual gameplays. 😁
Good luck to all Travelers who are planning to bring home Navia!
tayIor swiiiiiifttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
LOVE THE DEMO!! Convinced the "good nose" line is a reference to the wanted poster scene from Rapunzel.
ahahahahha she's so funny when hanging on the umbrella
She has an umbrella gun… I need that
The theme song is insane W hoyo
I wish all Swifties good luck on their summons
Just, WOW!
She really is the star of the show. And made laugh for a whole minute. He smile and the plot can't-
NO I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SAVING FOR ARRLECHINO HOW COULD THEY DO THIS TO ME
i love her so much omfg
QUEEN WE WILL BE SPENDING FOR ONE OF TEYVATS GEO QUEENS  😍
Lynette 😐☝️
im officially in love
Navia is the definition of: 💅
Is her voice a higher pitch or is it just me??? I love her demo tho, its very fluid and dynamic.
this was such a FUN trailer! I love the chase cutscene showcases her basic attacks before the actual showcase
woah good job
Lynette 💀
Imagine Melus and Silver still here
I love seeing her fight with the umbrella, makes me feel like we have our own princess peach in genshin
She's cute.
One of the most beautiful characters
I already made up my mind to not to pull for her, but this video is tempting me to shake up my decision.. I love navia!!
Ok now this demo is epic
She had a real RWBY vibe.  Also, very unfair trailer …
yo they took their time and CARE with this demo the direction is actually stunning!!!
This video and fighting gave me big RWBY vibes! Her umbrella is a axe/sword (something like that) and a gun? Love it!
goddamn she gorgeous
No dejó ni las rosas 💅🏼✨️🌹
IF SHE'S THIS PRETTY HOW CAN I POSSIBLY HAVE THE HEART TO SKIP HER? TAKE ALL OF MY PRIMOS NAVIAAAA!!
Now how does she run in those heels
Literally Mario cart and princess peach vibes
Broo no way this was directed like an .exe content. Navia the mafia boss is built different 😂
I love her. But sadly need to save for cloud retainer. Navia have to wait untill rerun ☹
The prettiest most adorable most cute girl ❤❤❤ NAVIA MAINS WE RISE
"Manners maketh man."-kingsman
This chasing was crazy how far they gone
Ah yes, American.
If only Melus and Silver was here...can't believe that they did not make the Demo after everything they have done for her.
claim claim claim claim Navia 💛💛💛💛💛
The guy voice in the end remind me of welt also pretty amazing music
No offense, but Navia's men are clearly incompetent. They can't handle anything on their own.
ARGGGHHH I'M SO MAD I CAN'T GET HER RN CUZ I NEED RAIDEN
NAVIA
She can definitely outrun  a T rex in those heels
I can't wait to c6 my Geo Queen!!!!!💛💛💛💛💛
Es increíble, lo que mejoran con la animaciones de las demo, Furina tiene la mejor música y Navia la mejor animación ❤❤😻
Navia trailer will heal my soul and body
it is stunning
Talk about fast paced and Action Packed, She was not letting that man go
SHE SERVED ATE AND A LITERAL ICONNNNN
0:46 Charlotte is ready📸
We will remember Melus and Silver so well. They did so well in the Archon Quest.
Lynette cameo she's so silly
This is a cute demo, but it just doesn't have the same oomph the last three had
NAVIA KYAAAAAAAAAAH
She's just beating this guy up this whole demo😂
Very elegant ❤
Genshin really did her dirty by dropping Xianyun the night before her demo.
Man, the quality of those videos is getting better with every new release
Navia is such a cool character! Her personality is everything with her abilities and looks! :D
THE OST? 😭WHAT A BOP-
Man, I just wish Geo was better in terms of reactions because dang, she's so cute!
Let's go
Can someone tell me why they changed her voice?
I LOVE HER AND NEED TO PULL FOR HER
Better call Navia
Did they change her voice actor?
won't parasol sound better 😅 just wondering.
0:46 I knew I saw Charlotte!
I LOVE NAVIA SMMMM
Did the entire budget for 4.X demos go to Neuvillette like? They've all been so bad except his
This aint a demo  This is a friggin action movie
God I wish I were that theif...
01:57 Navia: With this treasure...
NAVIAA
Im dead inside knowing that i will not be able to get her 50/50 and only have like 50 pull 😭
SHE DID NOT COME TO MESS AROUND GO QUEEN!!!!!!!
why did the animation just popped off all of a sudden???
If this game wasn't for kids that treasure hoarder would've been decapitated and had a few bullet wounds.
хароооооооош
NAVIA I LOVE YOU
All prefarming done 80+ pulls with Guaranteed let's go 😎
BABYGIRLLLLL
The Lynette cameo had me wheezing.
one word: served.
Imagine silver and melus cant keep up navia speed and parkour, they really goin probably proud of her she's doin❤🎉
Keep looking good even when chasing a criminal
Navia's my favorite Geo character of all time.  I really adore her design and endearing personality.
gurlie finds every way to show off with her umbrella, its so elegant
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA MY GIRL!!!!!!!!!
Navia (Taylor's Version)
I wanted ayaka's weapon, but now... now im not so sure...
THAT WAS AMAZING
OMG this gives me RWBY vibes XD the old ones of course
Oh no, I know Mina's gonna lose her marbles over this...
Thsi ate harder than furinas demo
Let us all who not only want her but also her sig(it's an axe after all, what's cooler than that!) have good luck!
I can't believe navia's demo has a lot of transitions
Good luck Travelers and Geo Gang on your pulls for the Mademoiselle!
Best action scenes in the game are trapped in a demo, smh. What a queen!
I still want the ability to glide with that parasol.
I CAN'T WAIT NO LONGER.
They had a hard time catching up and she just blitzed it in heels.
if u were legit any other element i would pull🥺
OMG MY WIFE IS SO PRETTY😭😭😭, I LOVE HER SM
I like that Lynette was the one to point out the blimp due to her voice line about Navia. It’s really fun to see these kinds of interactions between characters, especially where you don’t expect them!
0:47-0:48 SHE SINGIN' IN THE RAIN
Navia really be packing a garasol (gun/parasol) be a true American by having guns everywhere   And a better call saul soundboard
Cinematography in this one has all the ✨✨f l a i r✨✨ our Navia exudes. Most splendid, madam!
My QU-EEN!!!!
i love her so much
Demoiselle
One of the best demos, and i risk that is the best
0:35 "shes an icon, shes a legend , and she is the moment ".
Look at those animation. Smooth like a butter.
Navia be like: "SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND!".  Can't wait to pull her!  Good luck travelers!
She is such a Queen, I love her so much! She is amazing.
isso ta simplesmente perfeito mdssss
Wow the trailer was like a MOVIE hats off for Genshin
me encanto😃😃😃
She's so cool 😎😎❤❤❤❤
SHE'S SO COOL
Lynette announcing some help to Navia just by doing noise with her tea cup is so adorable. Looks like the house of the Hearth and the Spina di Rosula keep working together from time to time after the archon quest and I'm for more stories with both of them! Good luck for the pulls everyone!
OO
SHES SO COOLL
1:47 the key change in the music when she used her burst is giving me CHILLS, another classic from HOYO-MIX  hope all navia wanters become navia havers!!
I can't wait to get her 💛💛💛
ALL IN HEELS TOO
Navia on the case
It's not police brutality if you're not an officer ✨️✨️✨️
She can cook She can fight She's a gang leader She looks like an angel   Yup. Hoyo hit the jackpot designing her.
seeing this makes me want Genshin Taylor Swift even more.
She s perfect 😍😍😍😍
1:31 Lynette: Umm…Up there…😐
Vill V, is that you?
Its funny that every character trailer has Charlotte in it 🤣
NAVIAAAA ILYSMMM
Is that ProZD
Navia is so classy for using an umbrella, cannons, and an axe as weapons. A true gentlelady!
She's so gorgeous and breathtaking, i need beauties in my account.  When I get Neuvillette, i will save up and wait for her rerun.  Live laugh love Navia 💛
a
jesus holy cow they cooked navia well
Guys my wife is here
Imagine getting Navia for free, did you imagine? Forget it.
สวยชิบหายยยย
Im 16 minutes early, and theres alteady a thousand comments. Holy.
Subway Surfers chase scene who /j
taylor swifttt 💛💛💛
Why melus and silver had to die 😢 they could have been part of her kit
Taylor swift of genshin
YEAAAHH
0:20 it was at this moment he knew he f*ck up
can someone tell Navia's new sidekick that her umbrella is part of her arsenal and besides she's lady so she knows how to fight with elegance and grace
I just love how Lynette is just there drinking her Tea during the Chaos and just pointing out to the sky 😂😂😂
Makes me _so_ happy to see Navia getting to enjoy her job and position after everything that's happened during the archon quest.
is it just me or did they make her voice pitch higher? I liked the more mature sounding Navia on the archons quests
Navia my love
Can't believe I'm here early for once
Brothers. I haven't seen a Demo this Chaotic since Klee went around Blasting all the Hilichurls into the Afterlife.
Ahh~  Lynette-chan🐱
She's doing all these in HEELS 👠😮😮😮!
Navia is GEO's coolest lady, both in terms of design, combat, and her charming voice!
WE GETTIN THE THIEF WITH THIS ONE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
LMAO that Lynette cameo XD
I came...
Navia: *chasing a thief* Also Navia: *calls in an artillery strike*  As always, the OST is a banger in these demos.
The music at 1:30 ... my ears have been blessed, I love it 🤩
Easy skip
She slayed and ate but there was NO FURINA. I CAN NOT WAIT FOR 4.3 I NEED FURINA.
I wish characters had movement like in these cutscenes bro like in wuthering waves thet can run up walls not everybody gotta do it but the adepti or something at least look at what navia can do she's just a mortal
НАВИЯ, ПРОСТИИИ 😭😭😭 но я буду выбивать Райден, а тебя в следующий раз выбью, ОБЕЩАЮ!!!!
ฉันนึกถึงเย่หลานอะ 5555
YOU GO QUEEN 🎉
Navia... The modeling and skill motions came out very attractive and pretty no matter how I look at them lol In the meantime, just looking at Navia's appearance, it's so funny that Navia looks like Ether's oldest sister all the time because of her color 😂 (💛🤎💛🤎💛)
MI DAMA, TKM NAVIA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ❤
that poor guy- i could feel the discomfort in those few seconds of silence 😭😭
God they nailed this so well
She's using high heels and gown but run far more faster than her bodyguards 😂😂
I’m in LOVE with the sheer amount of energy in this demo. It’s expressive, fluid, and even a bit on the comedic side. Really shows how far the team behind them has come in terms of quality.
Not these rip-off body guards
Navia slayyy ❤
Navia is the best 💖😭
Navia's design make her looks like a 6 star character. 💃
1:30 Lynette helping her was so cute 🥺
I think Navia went too far.
Classy navia, and Lynette interaction is cute
THE WAY SHE ENDED ITTO I-
Fontaine characters always gotta be a little extra
SHE'S SO COOL
16 MINUTES AGO WIWUAIAU
i love her so much
Welp. You did it Hoyo, you've convinced me to not only whale for a character, but a gal at that. Can't wait to get her!
wow
Please hoyo, make her use umbrella instead of glider
Can’t wait for cnbee remix of this!
THE BEST GEO CHARACTER, QUEEN NAVIA!!!!!
Like how could not like her! LOOK AT HER! SHES SO COOL!
Dang her design is insane but it's the sunglasses that do it for me.
So ein cooles Intro hab ich lange nicht gesehen - gut gemacht 🎉
Bru idk if I should pull Ayaka or Navia
0:22 _"Where is the wind coming from, we're in a basement"_
1:01 that was perfect shot 💯💯🔥💛
They seem to have realised that the hsr system of lightcones is better then the genshin weapon system. Allows for more unique animations like with the umbrella. But they cant quit the weapon system so they're stuck.
Now THAT is a girlboss
They changed her voice right? I'm I crazy?
Melus and Silver 😭😭😭😭
Ready to admit defeat!   Me looking up ooooooh yeaaaaaaah
On one side a new useless geo character, on the other a new hot waifu.  I think we all know how this will turn out.
Spina De Rosula is really feeling the loss of Melus and Silver with these clowns following Navia. 😭
As soon as I saw Melus and Silver I started sobbing a bit. I miss them so much :(
All I’m saying is, if I wanna defeat enemies, I wanna do it with extra fashion points. Im pulling for her
dont end every character like that navia!!
If navia is that persistent when it comes to chasing criminals I csn only imagine how relentless she would be chasing after a potential love interest!?
demn
beautiful
Just One word - AMAZING
"This is his arrest warrant"... *(Shows half done sketch of generic dude in a mask.)*  What kind of sketchy 3rd world dictatorship they running out there?
Its nice, but why is her voice again this high? What happened with her version from archon quest?
The starry rose finally makes her debut.
seeing how fast navia is, she needs to have a running/stamina boost
Omg I literally love her so much! She's so funny too! I wonder if she'll use her umbrella when she falls, I think that would be super cool! Also her keeping her umbrella open while in a Hugh speed chase is hilarious and so her. Good luck to everyone pulling her!!!
The music just keeps getting better and better!  Sad this probably won't be in the new album coming out this patch, so we'll have to wait nearly a year for it 😢
are server alredy on?
Finally another Geo character who is a 5-star! Let's go! It's been so long. This Demo was another banger! 💥💛
That treasure horder has the worst luck
Good luck to those who are going for her! May she comes home early!
Haben will ! 👌💯💪✨💥
Navia is fast AF!!! I wish we saw more flashy movements in other trailers or in even more future cutscenes. Also, the early parts of her theme was getting us prepared for Natlan lol
SO PRETTY!!
Less then 24 hours 😍
FURANCIS DURAKU!!!
I can’t wait till she comes out
Navia is done so right. Even though I don’t pull for Geo characters because Hoyo didn’t fix Geo. Same as Zhongli(although he is OP) I’m pulling for her because I really like her character. I don’t even care for gameplay.
love the random cameo from Lynette
Her design, her gameplay, her character...everything looks so good, CAN'T WAIT
LETS GOOOO😊
what is chaos:
I think she's mid
WE MAKING IT OUT SPINA DI ROSULA WITH THIS ONE!!!!!
not a fan of geo but i like her
Remember to claim navia for free in 4.3..as long u have 180 pull
Tylor Swift??
Raza alguien sabe si el pack de las alas va a estar o se va de la tienda
Hello Lady Navia ❤
Chega logo Navia!!!
no  one will see this, nor will anyone care, but this demo was alright, definitely the weakest demo of fontaine so far
La quierooooo pero no me va a alcanzar. No sé para que me tire a la arconte 😢 tenía el asegurado
QUEEN NAVIA
GUARANTEEDDDDDD
a little info, navia for a party with albedo and zhongli she (maybe) can be a carry to replace itto
Absolutely beautiful, Navia just showing how powerful and boss she is :D And all while rocking fabulous and elegant attire, what a queen <3
I will pull both for the axe and for you Navia!!😭  (Primos going down to the drain😢)
OUR BOSS NAVIA
If Navia couldn't glide with her umbrella at this point, I'd be disappointed.
I adore her. But am I the only one who gets a Neo from RWBY vibe from her? Fighting style of Neo that is.
So prettu but cloud retainer is coming
Mihoyo never fails to deliver
spina di rosula members are so silly, i love it.
สวยมากกกกกก😭😭😭😭
Princess Peach's Smash alt outfit is finally here friends!
Just a pure queen showcase, full action and aggresive epic scenes, OMG THIS IS PERFECT !!!!!
Navia's theme certainly SOUNDED French to me. Although it might just be my ignorance letting me think that. I really liked it so, nice going Hoyo Mix! Yet another bop.
NAVIA IS COMING HOME 💛
What happened to her voice!?
They didn't have to gas her up so hard, dang...
Navia, I promise I will roll for you.
I love Navia <3333 She is so pretty, live, laugh, and, love.  Everyone will get navia.
main navia desde que salio el trailer
She is perfect she is beautiful I almost cried 🙏🙏🙏
Navia is Mafia
SUCH A QUEEN 😍😍😍
I LOVE HER SO MUCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
The beginning music omg its so good
Nice 👍
حبيت بس عندي فورينا    🦅
<3 <3 <3
Lynette cameo ^^
The girly pops are celebrating 🥳
I'll pull her, for sure... oh no... What about cloud retainer? Damn it...
The fact they acknowledge her umbrella's air resistance is gonna be a pity she won't glide on her umbrella.
Diluc got powercreept, Navia the new Genshin Batman!
No iba a tirar por navia pero su demo me convenció 😂❤ Es increíble que cada demo supera y supera a la anterior no me quiero imaginar cuáles van a hacer las joyitas de natlan y snezhnaya 💞💗
BEST DEMO FR
Navia needs to use her entire kit to kill a treasure hoarder.
i love how her elemental skill looks like a weapon straight out of RWBY
Yeah, my wallet is not happy with me right now.
THE MUSIC IS SO COOL OMG
I CANT BREATH SHE SO GORGEOUS
❤
guy was up against Mary Poppins with heavy artillery. There was no chance.
This demo has some STYLE, I cannot wait to have Navia fill in the BLANK SPACE in my team. There is no CRUEL SUMMER or BAD BLOOD with Navia around, just a beautiful LOVE STORY beyond anyone's WILDEST DREAMS.
LETS GOOOOO QUEEN
NAVIA DONT END ALL OF GEO LIKE THAT…
We got no lead on the theif  The thief:
The choreo goes crazy in this one
She’s so wacky I love her.
Navia's demo is absolutely amazing, these demos just keep getting BETTER AND BETTER
OMFG NAVIAAAA WE LOVE UUU
FINALLY NAVIA DEMO AAAA MY GIRL I LOVE HEERRRR

HER IST IS SO AAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! IM DEF PULLING FOR THIS QUEEN
I CAN'T WAIT TO PULL FOR YOU MY MS. FABULOUS ✨ COME HOME EARLY AND YOUR WP TOO 💛
Demo boa 👍👍
Ahhhhh I see how she ends up flying up and then floating down with her Umbrella in every other Trailer.  She's got no closing the umbrella on high speed boat policy.
BANGER THEME
Hoyo please, let me be Navia main(5th 50/50)

1:26 Lynette so cute
I LOVE HER SO MUCH OMG 🥹💗
it would be cool if navia can also glide in the game using her umbrella instead of the wing  glider xD
Taylor Swift officially debuted in Teyvat. May all Navia Swift wanters be Navia Swift havers ♥️
damn this feels so sad without the two guys. why do they have to trigger their own death flag
Go get them, Queen 😎
Boys... If Melus and Silver aren't there to care of her anymore, then, we'll need to pull her to do so. Do it for them.
She sounds different than she did in the archon quest. Did her VA change?
Dang Navia really went from being known as the president of Spina di Rosula to being the Mario of Genshin Impact 0:40
2:12 THAT RIFF! IT SOUNDS LIKE A CERTAIN LAWYER’S THEME
I love this trailer, it shows her fun side sm
nine mintues
What a fun demo❤
Gonna pull Navia soon 😘❤
Man, Navia's theme hits so hard
Her burst is artillery bombardment. Talk about over the top!
LOVEEE
I love me some trance music🎵
Navia will be the best geo character!!
I love that her umbrella is weaponized, just like The Penguin. And she really slays when she puts the shades on.
That's a goofy ahh thief💀
SHE'S SO SLAYYYY!! I LOVE HERRR
2:09 I knew they we're gonna do the meme where a guy with shades is walking behind him is an explosion 😂
Hoyo should really make her an outfit with the sunglasses!!
XD coool
“Please boss, put your umbrella away!” is hilarious! 😂🤣😂
Ngl Is it just me or is Navia’s Voice higher than usual?
MELUS AND SILVER YOU WILL BOTH NEVER BE FORGOTTEN 😭😭😭
NAVIA WANTERS WILL BE NAVIA HAVERS!!
Primero quiero saber si será bueno tirar por navia
taylor swift
I'll be getting myself a Taylor Swift and do a Teyvat World Tour.
she needs her own glider thats just her umbrella
She's so pretty! Navia wanters = Navia havers!!
She a runner she a track star ⭐
she’s so mami tomoe coded i love it💛
I really want to pull for her but my beloved Furina drained all of my primos for her and her weapon.
WHAT A DEMO!!! 🔥🔥🔥 Navia is insane! That energy and sweetness 🤩 Navia’s wanters need doctors! 😉
THIS TRAILER IS SO GOOD
SHES SLAYING OMGGG
hello the quality ?!?!?!?
The swag is unmatched.
Very nice
Wow❤❤❤❤❤ it's wonderfull
ITS GIVING NOBODY NO CRIME
Ladies and Gentlemen, here comes our Geo Queen
This is definitely my favourite demo since it portrays the character well and its super funny only thing is I hope her two new sidekicks live
The ending..lol 😂 she is so extra
This character demo just makes me wan't to pull for navia even more. I am so excited to get her. Wish me luck everyone and i wish you the best luck as well.😊
Zhongli be like : I am not single anymore  😭 finally after few years  GEO five star girl coming
1:36 Navia's Crossing the Delaware #merica  btw, those are undoubtably aviator shades.
I NEED THAT PARASOL
2:11 NAVIA SAUL GOODMAN???
My girlllll queennnn
TE AMO NAVIA SWIFT ERES LA MEJORRR REINOTA
The animation is so good??? And the transition from the animations to her attacks with the umbrella is just amazing! The Demos just keep getting better!!!
Honestly Navia got one of the prettiest designs. Cannot wait to wish for her. Gl to everyone else too
MY PRETRY WIFE <333333
You can outrun the Spina di Rosula, but can you outrun... bullet?
Is her voice a bit more high pitched compared to the archon quests?
OUR GIRL BOSS IS ALMOST HERE
Navia ftw auto c6 ♥️
Cannons go brrrr
Navia slaying with fashion~~~❤
Did anyone else hear the Better Call Saul meme guitar chord?
Genshin must have gotten a bigger animation budget for its demos because GODDAMN!  Good luck fellows pulling for Navia! \o/
Idc if she’s good or not I’m pulling for her!!!!
AAAAAAATE SHE ABSOLUTELY ATEEEEEEEE SLAY THE HOUSE DOWN QWEEN
Lol 2:30 only to chase hoarder with arsenal 😅
I love Lynette so much, I’m glad she had somewhere to shine here ! 🤯
MOMMY
Bro not her making me falter from the path to eternity.
NAVIA KNOW SHE ATE SHE IS THE MOMENT
how many times have i already rewatched this? yes :3
ITS SO GOOOOOOOD
HoYo never fails to deliver! (in terms of character demos.)  also is it just me or Navia sounds more high-pitched?
All the Fontaine character themes are super good, I'd say this one is probably my favorite so far but also Navia is my favorite Fontaine character so I might be a little biased XD
Why i feel Like i playing slash man (megaman 7) stage?
A ray of sunshine, full of life and a total boss lady <3  Meluse and Silver would be so proud of her Good luck to all navia wanters and go win your 5050s :D
That flare with the Spanish guitar, chef's kiss
hi
Never let Klee meet her please
LOVE HER!
skip     tapi biasanya saya ngebadut karakter karakter model gini, macam cyno bisa sampe signature dan c2 anyinc
The Lynette part was so cute?? I love how they put her in Navia's demo!
Omg i cant decide between her and cloud retainer 😭
I can already see the editors taking notes on which clips to put with a song- Ok in all seriousness Navia being the queen she is seriously eats and leaves no crumbs 😂
01:04 For a second thought she was about to shoot the cannons at him 😅just imagine, poor guy.  Cool demo, hope I get lucky with her.
Navia Swift always a queen
I hope my bad luck doesnt show and I lose the 50/50, i must have and main her.  And this is by far one of the best genshin character demos ever
The soundtrack is so...'Noice! 😉'
She’s so cool! Good luck to us tomorrow! 🍀 May we all win our 50/50s at early pity and get her and her weapon 🙏
finally we get a geo character .  Also i love her demo so much! tbh i think we found the 2nd princess peach cuz for my opinion she kinda does
Mixing together western steel guitars, spanish guitar, french accordian, and EDM..... and somehow it just works.  Hoyomix just doing hoyomix things.
Vigilantism gone fun. Can't wait
No me pareció tan buena esta demo xd pero igual tiraré por Navia porque es una belleza 💛
holy hell it's piper from brawl stars
Calling her a badass would be an understatement.
SHE SO PRETTY AND SILLY MUST RESIST PULLING I WANT HER SO BAD THO BUT I NEED ARLECCHINO BUT I MIGHTTTTTT BE ABLE TO GET BOTH  SHGDAHGSJAGDJHAS
2:13 meanwhile Navia in Jujutsu Kaisen Navia : Are you crying ? Thief : HELL NO
IF SHE DOESNT GLIDE WITH HER UMBRELLA-- 😖😖😖
She is a queen I love her designs I love her animation💜💚💜💚
COME HOME NAVIA PLEASE I LOVE YOU
this isn't girl boss energy,  it's girl chief executive officer energy
She’s ALMOST perfect. The only thing missing is that she has a unique gliding animation that makes her use her umbrella instead of a glider.  Will pull regardless! 💛
Yooo niceee
“Ready to admit defeat?” *YES MY QUEEN* 😩😩❤️🥵
MY QUEEN JUST RUN ON THE WALL ❤
His subordinates are a bunch  wackos in their job. Melus and Silver would make her 10x badass in Navia's trailer.
Fire
She looks she's part of Kings man secret service!
Girl brought the bombs
Navia my love please come home
THE MUSIC, THE BEAT, THE CINEMATIC VIEWS, THE PERSONALITY! NAVIA THE QUEEN IS SLAYING SO HARD
GOOD LUCK TO EVERYONE PULLING FOR GEO UMBRELLA-GUN LADY!!

TOMORROW CAN'T COME SOON ENOUGH
En cuestión de horas ya es mia😍
Her design, the cutscene, everything is just so beautiful! She is amazing!
I don't know what happened to Navia especially her voice her behavior i mean her in story Quests she seemed more mature and now acting like a teenager? I know she was having a bad time but not her whole personality!!!
I love my sassy girllll! Her battle voices are so cute
0:10 that camera angle can't be coincidence
Pfv navia venha pra mim 🏳️
I am ready for Gunshin Impact. Good luck to all.
LOVE IT SHE US THE BESTTTTTT
ahhh she’s so pretty!! love the demo
Girly pop
She is the definition of girlboss and I am so here for it 💅🏾
NAVIA MY BELOVESDDWEJFGJIQEIKL;W
OMG the actions scenes are superb!!! dont think there's any other demo that has this much flashy action to it
Rest In Peace Melus and Silver
Navia parece ser maravilhosa de se jogar também, porém.. tenho a Xianyun em minha vista, e não poderei ceder as minhas tentações. Boa sorte a todos que irão atirar nela!!
Butuh full song nya
1:29 😅
Alamak, Terlalu manis gulanya 😢
WE REVIVING MELUS AND SILVER WITH THIS ONE 🔥🔥
Bro I heard that Saul Goodman riff at the end 💀
the animation is on another level
She is so extra and i love her😭
Мега крутой ролик
NAVIA!! Love her lots but I have to save for Arlecchino......
Esse sorrisinho da navia antes de vir a porradaria kkkkkkkkkk
Good luck with your pulls everyone!
SHE WILL SAVE GEO! OUR QUEEN
This demo is so wild, unpredictable and fun! Really loving Navia’s personality and kit so far!!
1:31 1:32 Lynette!! 💕
She slayed ❤
Watching from Tunarri's stream
"This one has your name on it" Blaaam "Damn missed"
THIS IS SO HYPE WTFFF!!
She's soo cute 😍
Exquisite beyond words
I LAUV NAVIA OGMGOG
MAJESTOUS! ❤
NAVIA IS SO PRETTY
NAVIA AFTER BEING THE MOST GIRLBOSS OF ALL THE GIRLBOSSES EVER
Bruh she just do anything too fast and forget her costume lol
THIS GIRL IS SO ACROBATIC IT HURTS
Aí vey, eu amei a demo! Bem animada e divertida, exatamente como a boneca é
Her design is so gorgeous and detailed. If you think overwise don't talk to me (⁠o⁠´⁠･⁠_⁠･⁠)⁠っ
Its unfortunate that her banner comes before cloud retainer's banner
ate
Same reason i pulled for furina idc about the power its the aesthetic also 1:31 lynette just randomly there is hilarious
I want Navia to hit me like that. the dude is so lucky.
NAVIA WANTERS WILL BE NAVIA HAVERS!!!!!!!!
jos wajib di pull ini haha
I was saving for engulfing but dmn I'm so tempted to get her
Also did navia's voice change?
Now that's what i like to call "Style", fellas. She got looks, guards, skills and freaking CANNONS, this girl is unstoppable, no matter the odds.
Is Navia worth pulling, gameplay-wise?  I'm not sure if I should invest my Primogems and my Guaranteed Pull for Navia.
So pretty
Navia has to be built like an Olympic goddess because aint no way she's doing parkour around the entirety of Fontaine while holding a shotgun umbrella in HEELS.
Credits to Lynnette for that
so funny! xie xie yaun shian inmpact, very ffun characetr! navia woman so cool... cannot waiting! good fortune
Balam Industries
HELP I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING WHEN EVERYONE WAS LOOKING AT THE MAN AND HE WAS LIKE "🧍"
LYNETTE CARRIED!!!
HELLO SAILOR
Huh... her voice is a bit higher pitched than the Archon quest. Is this another Kokomi scenario 😰
Imagine NOT pulling for Navia, I'd be SO embarrassed like-
balls
Navia my wife best character from Fontaine.
Subway surfers
we love when a woman can be badass without sacrificing her girly feminine nature. my fav kind of girlboss
SEA SHADOW GOT AN ANEMO RESONANCE BUFF DAYMN BUT NAVIA GOT THEM YELAN SKILL GGWP SIR SEA SHADOW SIR
Where to wish for Navia?
TAKE MY CREDIT CARD
GIRLBOSS
10/10 action like never before in a character trailer Navia is "rockin" good....get it?
THE WAY HER AND HER THEME ACTUALLY ATE SO MUCH ITS INSANE OMFG
*blushes*
LYNETTE COMING IN CLUTCH WITH THE ASSIST

SHES SO SWAG!!!
Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed guests and fellow admirers, gather 'round for a moment of heartfelt admiration and genuine awe for a figure whose mere existence radiates brilliance and strength—none other than the illustrious Navia.  GRRRRRRRRRRR WOOF WOOF BARK BARK ARF BARK GRRRR WOOF SNARL HSSSS GRRRR WOOF WOOF BARK ARF GRRRR HSSSS WOOF WOOF BARK ARF GRRRRR HSSSSS BARK ARF GRRRR WOOF WOOF BARK GRRR SNARL ARF WOOF BARK ARF SNARL HSSSSSS  ...Navia, my beloved. My queen. Her name echoes through the halls of our admiration, resonating with courage, grace, and an indomitable spirit that defies the odds.  If  has a million fans, then count me as one among them. If Navia's following comprises ten devoted souls, rest assured, I am among that passionate throng. Should she find herself with only one admirer, let it be known that it is none other than myself. And if, perchance, Navia were to face a solitary moment, devoid of any fans, then mark my absence, for I shall have transcended this mortal realm.  In a world that might turn against her, know this: I stand resolutely by her side, a loyal companion, defender, and advocate. For Navia embodies the very essence of resilience, valor, and unyielding determination. She navigates the storms with an unwavering resolve, inspiring all who are fortunate enough to witness her presence.  Navia isn't just a character; she's a beacon of hope, an emblem of strength, and an exemplar of what it means to persevere against all odds. Her virtues transcend the pages or screens that contain her story, reaching deep into our souls and igniting a fire of admiration and reverence.  So here's to Navia, a paragon of courage and a testament to the power of the human spirit. May her legacy endure, her bravery inspire, and her name be forever etched in the annals of our admiration.
NAVIA EATING AS ALWAYS ⁉️
