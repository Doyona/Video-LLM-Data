Loooove Hello Fresh!!!!
I wish I had known how to handle those red/ orange flags a long time ago 😢 also, HE should be paying for all the divorce expenses, since HE is the one causing it 🤨
I am sorry you are having to move,i know how you love living near your parents.  But think positive there are better things to come.
Also, I guess the what you use as far as to make the videos the software because I just wanna learn how you do everything because you are fabulous and I just think your videos are great. Your content is great and I just love everything about what you’re doing and I know right now you’re going through a hard time With a divorce and everything but remember sometimes God‘s clearing out something in your life to bring you something better and you don’t even see it coming but you will know when that someone comes in your life. It’s gonna love you for you and love everything about you sometimes, we just don’t know until we know anyway, you have a blessed and wonderful day. This is Rhonda from Texas.
I have a question could you do a video on the things that you use as far as like cameras? I know you’re probably using your phone but do you use like your cameras or like the lighting all the equipment to make your videos?
Beautiful 🤩 😻 😍
“I’ve seen what i’ve needed to see” 💀💀💀💀💀💀 I FEEL YOU GIRL
I've been single goong on 7 years and honestly. I love it. I don't miss having a boyfriend. What honestly makes me sad is that I spent all of my youth focusing on crappy boyfriends instead of friendships. Now I'm in my 30's and just don't have the friend circle I wish I had. As far as a significant other, I can't even be bothered with that. I just love the freedom and my personal space.
I'm so sorry for this happening to you and the family going through this. I don't know if being young matters. They may ask questions later on in their life. Wish you all the best results.
Men who scream women r the issue, m just curious how do they hop from 1 women to another so quick. Divorced or widowed doesnt matter they hop back on while women after that do not wanna see man again mostly
Needed to hear this love u ❤
Keep working hard. Trust God he will provide for you. I will be praying for you
Will you be changing your last name 10:02
We could be best friends. I think the EXECT same way.
If u start a new channel I'll totally follow u there, sorry everything is being prolonged. Thank u for all your videos and posts I truly enjoy your content.
Love you girl. How are hour boys mommy ? How r u?
You look younger and happier and healthy
Why would new romance evenly remotely be on your mind anyway tho only a month after filing for divorce?  How could u possibly make a wise decision so emphatically rt now when the ink isn’t even dry on your current complex situation including still living together?
Hey Brittany, I have watched your videos for years, from what I have gathered, you are a cancer, the most sweet caring and gentle sign (my favourite sign) and I believe, Ryan is an Aries, the most self centred, impulsive and unaware signs. To me, an Aries male is a red flag 😂   I want you to know that it is so clear how deeply you love your children and that is all that matters. Everything happens for a reason, even if we don't know it at the time. Ask yourself, why did I chose this situation? Why did I chose this person? Be gentle and kind to yourself, do not beat yourself up for one moment! Talk to yourself how you would talk to your kids 🩷
You are way too young to say never to dating. Just say "not now" and move forward.
Good . Your kids come first.
Holy fuck girl. What a shock of a video to catch up on you with
I think brunette and a bit shorter on your hair. You asked…
❤
Brittany I’m happy you have financial security of your own. It’ll be so much easier this way. Xo
Wow. You just described my entire relationship. Ugh
Where are you
I have divorced parents and I have noticed it’s harder for children of divorced parents to have successful marriage themselves, I would recommend getting involved with a local church because it will give you a place to have faith, community, and be around like minded people ❤ sending good vibes your way
Thank you girl!  You’re going to make it…better!
Thank you for your honesty!  I've been divorced since 1996, single mom, the whole bit.  Never re-married.  Yes, we do need to normalize "being alone".  I've had challenges for sure, but, at 67 years old and now retired, I have learned to like my "aloneness".  Take care.  Sending warm wishes for you. 🙂
I was the same as you, wasn’t interested to date, I put all my focus on my children.. 17 years down the line now, I’ve started dating.. My youngest child now being 27 ❤….
I'm so sorry you're going thru this.  God bless you and your children.
I hear you!. Romantic relationships are overrated.
Does it kill anyone else who went through similar to Brittany (I'm just going by what she's saying to assume I have) and think... why weren't we taught red flags etc when we were little? Society/friends/family would make comments (and maybe they didn't know the degree of the issues) that just felt like..oh this is how it is. If you want to be married this is just how it is and there's no changing facts. But turns out I have friends who have happy marriages so it's not true.
We also didn't tell the kids until we actually got separate homes!  Also not that I'm like dating anyone seriously, but I also said I would never date again and for the first year that was true. Now I date but I'm kinda unimpressed by my options LOL. I think I'm at a place now where I can go on dates, but I'm not sure I really actually want anyone to move in again. If you get to the point on wanting to date, just being honest about where you're at is best. There will be men fine with dating in whatever way you're looking for (maybe not the SAME men though). Anyway i'm likely still damaged too haha. Risks are too high to join a life with someone else when I can handle all the stuff on my own anyway.  My ex had a gf within months though and my kids have met her, but I knew this would happen as be told me the day after the I asked for the divorce that he needs time to date LOL
If anyone can do it, you can! ❤ soon we’ll look back at this moment
good for you...allow yourself to roll with the waves...but your positive outlook will take u far give yourself time to heal and if you do or don't, time will tell..focus now on yourself and your kids..best of luck..yes, real estate is insane here in ca
Im not divorced and not going through one at the moment, but I resonate with her in the dating part. I always say, if I’m ever in that situation my focus will be myself and my children. I understand we all have needs but once we have children our responsibility is to care, protect and give them our full undivided attention. Dating requires time to get to know people, I would rather spend that time with my children as custody will be split, time with them will also be affected. Maybe I’m just old school, but I can’t bare myself in bringing a man to my children other than their father.
Thank you for being so open with us. You are a strong, smart and beautiful woman! I know someday….probably once your kids are grown up…you will allow yourself to love again. Just hope you’ll be able to fend off all the hopefuls until then, because they will come. 😊 I think it’s smart not to date while the kids are little…I wish you all the best because you deserve it!!❤
Thank You  for clarifying  its ok not to date, to not want to date . That is ok to put that portion of your life on the side and being modest. YOU WILL BE IN OUR PRAYERS AND GRATEFUL TO SEE SUCH A NICE MOM . We hug you from a distance and may God keep you and guide you on this moment of your life.
The beige flags I saw with my ex. Is he became a complete jerk. So I knew something was up. He became verbally, emotionally, and physically abusive to me.
You are so empowering ❤ i love you ❤ blessings to you😊
I'm so sorry,  my fav book is divorce war, It has info no one will tell you.  ( Divorce War! : Fifty Strategies Every Woman Needs to Know to Win by Bradley A. Pistotnik (1995, Trade Paperback)  Thank God for your great videos.❤
My grandmother was lucky enough to marry older, her mid 30s and be with the love of her life until she lost him to cancer. She lived a beautiful joyful life without ever remarrying or dating. I asked once why and she said she knew she found her true love why waste her freedom and happiness on anyone who would never be him for her.  I separated from my husband for a while and never had the desire to find anyone else.  I honestly just found the guys to be totally incompatible and not the type of people I’d want to be with romantically. Good thing. Because my marriage worked itself out and I’d hate to have that be anything hanging over my head.  I don’t know for sure if he dated or not. I think so but I’m not ever going there. 22 years now
Brittany, I pray the lord gives you more strength and courage.I hope he gives you peace and happiness  during these hard times. Many people can attest to how positive, helpful, giving and incredible you are and don’t forget it! Your babies will see their happy momma and know what they deserve in a relationship through your example. Be happy and live to the fullest for you and your babies.
There is a provider in every mother. You will thrive and set the best example for your kids.
I don't think I have ever seen one of your videos before but I completely understand how this feels and having it made it through to the other side... oh my God do you have so sooo much happiness and thriving waiting for you!  You got this ❤️
I'm so glad to see these wonderful and supportive comments. You're being so vulnerable and authentic which I think will really help you come out of this happier and wiser. As for the divorce costs, is there a way to cut down the legal bills through direct agreement with your ex? Im sure nobody wants to pay the lawyers but instead, direct the funds towards your kids.
I told my husband if something would happen between him and I that I would never get into another relationship and I wouldn't bring another man around our son . He said I was crazy that we are never getting a divorce we said till death do us part I said ya that's what I said the first time I got married and look at what happened lol
You are dealing with this in a classy manner, not praising him but not bashing him because he is the father of your kids.  Stay strong and you will get through this in time.
Reading people’s comments makes me so sad that my BIL moved on literally a week later and SIL a month or two later and their kids have met the other person for both of them like 2 weeks into it 🫣😣divorced in their 10th year of marriage
I am a big fan of Dr. Laura Schlessinger. And she always promotes that the best things for children are to hold off dating and bringing someone else into their lives after they are 18, up and out. I did not know this years ago, and it was hard on my daughter and my husbands children. I was lucky to have remarried into a wonderful family, but there are scars. I can’t go back and fix the hurt, but we have created a very loving family. I applaud you for focusing on yourself, your children, your own peace of mind, and creating a warm, loving home life. 👏👏👏👏👏
I just found your videos and I've become hooked on your content.  This makes the mom side of me want to give you a hug but on the flip side I see you are holding up beautifully and powering thru the tough moments.  Good for you!  ❤
What you allow, will continue. GOOD for you girl!
Girl, is the curling iron actually on.😂
I understand. I feel the same. No more relationships. Big hug to you 🤍
Praying God will bless you and your children at this time.
Am in your shoes right now am the cleanest person in England as I spend most of my time in the shower crying so my kids don't hear me xx
Mind blowing how couples throw $$$$$ at lawyers for divorce!!! I found the courthouse has instructions for DIY Divorce. It cost me a total of $400.00!!!! That’s it!!! We split the cost and divided everything rationally. We have 2 kids and we opted for amicable cooperation and it does get easier over time!!!   DIY divorce is the way to go, save yourselves all that extra $$$ ‘cause you need it for later!!!!
I just re-signed signed up for Hello Fresh. I have been trying others and they just don’t compare.  When you are past this stage in your life, you are going to thrive even more!  Happiness is the best….
Britney, I feel you. If I get divorced im never getting married again. I cannot go through all that again. I think being alone will be less stressful. My marriage right now  is everything you explained about red and orange flags. Marriage is so hard.
Your children will handle it better than you think.  Don't worry about what hasn't happened yet, just focus on today... for what you worry about may never happen.
I divorced my narcissistic husband 35 years ago, and I thought I would marry again. But after dating for a couple of years, I stopped dating for good. I am 67 and very happy. Marriage was a j-o-b, not a loving relationship.
He definately cheated
I'm sorry you're going through all of this. All the best.
Ryan should be more amicable on the financials.    It should not rise to the level of forensic accounting.  WOW,  he’s seems to be making things unnecessarily difficult .
Good Lord!!! 😮 She is bat shit crazy!  Stay away!
Here in Sweden we divorce without lawyers
Sending you love and prayers Brittany 🥰🙏
I've just filed, now doing what I always do, making sure everyone else is ok 😢❤ Hopefully this time next year I'll get to take care of me 🎉
I send you healing energy as I unsubscribe
Why are they divorcing? What happend?
I see you have a lot of anxiety, on the way you are talking and you body movements… 🙏🏻🙌🏻 I pray to God to guide you.
Wishing you the very best during this challenging time! I know you will be just fine because you have such a beautiful heart.
I felt so badly for you when you had your babies and Ryan was working out rather than helping you. It seemed like a sign. Givers need to be with givers. You are clearly a giver. Better days ahead. You are beautiful, smart, hard working and a wonderful Mom. Sending hugs and prayers. ❤
What a powerful woman. You got this❤
Hey B I have been one of you followers for many years now but haven't been watching for a while. I am very sorry for everything and hope you guys can stay friends and be good co parents.
My parents divorced when i was 7 my mom was 32 at the time and she never did anything but raise me and my sister after her divorce, she did not care about dating or marriage and she dedicated her life to us, people to this day 21 years later are still encouraging her to do so but she does not want to so i understand your position of future romance
Is he hiding money with a FA is why I ask dont let him do that
Find a nice navy officer when your ready
Dont date
Its hard for you to have him there
You need to keep the house did u buy it
It is so upsetting to hear when a spouse has not only hurt someone in marriage but has taken away their future romance/marriages they could have from the emotional scarring! Not that it matters but he wasn't even attractive! If she wanted to she could get a way better guy although we support never wanting to date again. If you are with someone with a shitty personality they might as well be at least good looking. I hope he didn't cheat. I bet the way he is dealing with this is the exact opposite of her. He's probably not interested in therapy or bettering himself or grieving. Im guessing he's just busy working out and having no thoughts. Such a shame 😢
Oh no! I’m so sad to hear this. I’m glad you’re working on yourself. Good luck on your journey.
Im sad and sorry😢😢
Taking care of yourself and your kids, is the most important thing right now. You are a strong, resilient lady. ❤
My parents divorced when I was 16. I'm 55 now. My mom never remarried. She went on dates on occasion. I think I would be the same. Marriage is hard and I'm not marriage material. ❤
I agree we should normalize choosing to be single ❤
"I've seen what I needed to see" You do you Boo ❤
Sounds freeing
They should make speedy divorces for exceptional situations
I hope you can keep your marriage and not separate.❤ this is my first video I watch from this channel.
Is he refusing to move out? Because if he is then that tells me everything. The kids must feel the tension so I think it will be a relief when it’s out in the open and he is out of the house.
I have been so impressed with you and how you are dealing with your current situation. You are putting your kids first. Bravo! As hard as this is you’ve got this!
God bless you and your family! Storms will always come but eventually they pass and end! You’re stronger than you think! Keep going! Have a wonderful peaceful blessed night! XOXO
Thank you!  If/when you can, could you make a video with a "manual" of how to start tge journey you started. Making decision to split etc. For soneobe who's in a similar position but a few steps behind. Thank you!!
Yasss let's normalise being single! Being single does not mean you can't live a happy, fulfilled life. It does not mean there's something missing in our lives ❤
Hi Brittany ❤️ it's so true that when a disagreement is happening, the true colors of that person come out. If they are not willing to stay calm and sit down and talk about what is on our mind or their mind that is a red flag for sure.
If you dont feel ok in your home sell it and buy another smaller more beautiful to start fresh
You have a brand and you are economical free from your husband you have your income . You mustn't worry for your economical
Your house is yours? Change your bed this will help your mental health . Another thing is to change furniture and buy only furniture eith your taste only
Love you keep being who you are😊
Hi Brittany! I look up to you so much as an older sister, thank you for sharing and teaching us and being your authentic self. It helps us in so many ways and makes us feel not alone<3
Girl... I'm getting a divorce because, my husband is a controlling narcissist and I also found out that he was cheating on me with guys! He caused me to loose my job and he took all my money! DFCS took our daughter! Anyway, now I have a new job and a new place! I'm getting my daughter back and my ex-husband is is jail because he is also psycho!!! So I feel ya! It will get better!
Why are you divorcing at all? What happened?  You both seemed so happy. I don't get it.
I loved your discussion about the Red and Orange flags, things to avoid that you would teach your children.  That is a great thing to do and I will do the same for my children to help them navigate relationships in their lives. Thank you for sharing that!!!!   I don't want to sound insensitive, are you talking about your divorce because you want to increase your video viewing or is it true.  I have not watched your videos in some time, not like I used to. So, I am just curious if your situation is true.  There have been fake things going on with other YouTubers that have some viewers questioning the validity of their content.
Normalize being single as a VALID OPTION!!! This is so refreshing to hear❤❤❤ people are so obsessed with being in a relationship
CLASSY LADY!! Beth Bearclaw
❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Be  strong , stay  focus. YOU  CAN  DO  IT !
I haven't dated in 10 years. It's been the most peaceful 10 years of my life. For some people, single is a great choice.
I literally JUST found out about this. I watched your videos about a year or two ago and came back. Omg. I’m so sorry! I’m 38 and I feel like I’m in a similar place- not mourning a relationship but very much seeing the dating world as it is…just not my vibe. At all. I think our culture is to blame for part of the toxicity but some folks just don’t appreciate what they have. Love you! You’re a good mom BECAUSE you’re doing this. Listen, I’ve never seen a healthy relationship. My grandparents stayed together ”for the kids” and that was a nightmare for my mom. You’re doing the right thing. Don’t doubt yourself in this! Also, most of the time, kids can tell when you’re doing your best. God’s got this!❤❤❤
Brittany you are beautiful 🥰 Do what's best for YOU. I like they say... if you're not ok then you can't be good for anyone else especially your kids. Sending lots of hugs & love your way 🤗💖
You still haven’t said what went wrong. What did you not like about Ryan?? How were you incompatible?
❤❤
Recently started HelloFresh and I really love it! Thanks for sharing your story its really helping me try to heal. Going through a difficult breakup and sometimes I find it hard to get out of bed but seeing how you are staying positive helped me this morning! Love and light to you!
I’m new to your channel and was wondering if your soon to be ex-husband worked? X
Not to be a d**k but I always thought your husband was kinda douchey
You disgust me.
I got a divorce and was single-dated many but nothing serious for 5 years. Sorry you're going through this. It is hard and really tough with kids. Stay strong and just live daily.  Someday you might meet someone but that is Definitely not a priority for sure! We are here from afar for emotional support!
Im sending so so so much love 🥹 you’ve helped me in probably every single aspect of my life and i it’s appreciated and admire you 💖 and thank you for continuing to make content to help other people that are maybe going thru it bc we all have something even if sometimes we aren’t ready to necessarily talk about it 🥹🥹
Choosing yourself is the best THING you can do. I also recommend getting massages and spa treatments. It will help relax you 🙂
After 2 kids so shallow
Lame
as a child of almost divorce, I kept telling my parents: "2 happy households is better than 1 unhappy arguing household." Stay strong Brittany! you got this. you'll get through and Carter & Capri will get through it as well!
😢😢😢😢 oh my gosh haven't been on you page for ages. Genuinely upset about your split I will have to update. Hope you're keeping well and the children xxxxxx❤
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 I too have been a single mom my daughters entire life and have not wanted to date since I’ve had her.  I dated a lot before her and that was great, but no need now.  She’s 17 now and I’m COMPLETELY happy flying solo!!!  Im glad you’re doing well and recognize it’s YOUR choice & your happiness.  😘♥️
I’ve been watching you for years. Through out my 3 pregnancies. You have been one of my favs for years because of your authenticity & mom skills. It’s only up from here. You are showing your kids independence & happiness. Would you mind sharing who does your eyebrows? They are perfection!! Wishing you all the best!❤
Sending hugs and love your way❤️
I'm so sorry to hear! Heartbreaking!
Love love love you Brittany !!! You are such a strong 💪🏽 woman and you are going to be even stronger after this plus you’re beautiful on the outside and inside you’re helping others as always!!! We are here for you so just keep taking care of you and have faith!!! Sending love to you and strength 💕to get through this .
Im so sorry yoh are going through all this..❤❤I just lose complete respect for men tha in separation choose to live in the house ..like DAMN! RESPECT the mother of your kids she needs to somehow be whole for the kids..why stay there making everything so uncomfortable. You will thrive in end j know it!
Love you Brittany!  You are a wonderful woman and mother. ❤❤
I’ve watched you for so many cool and fun home hack stuff etc! Just saw this video. I am praying for you that the love of Christ draws you to Him and gives you peace and guidance in every way you have needs. In Jesus’ name.
I LOVE riding solo!
Thx for your honesty❤
Will your last name change?
Love you girl, one day at a time. You will love being single,I promise🙂

In your 20’s never be tied down to anyone, who you are in your 20s is not who you are in your 30s who you are in your 30s is not who you are in your 40s who you are in your 40s is not who you are in your 50s and so on be single be free, in your 30s if you want to settle down go for it but be smart the only person you can change is yourself.
You don't have to be married to be someone you don’t have to have children to be someone and death divorce and moving are the three most stressful life events therapy is wonderful.
100% the best decision you can date when they turn 18 the youngest is 18 and then it’s your turn. And you’ll meet somebody wonderful at that time.
I think it’s a very wise decision to stay single for as long as you need to. I did too after my divorce and don’t see myself dating again. I’m finally able to be my true self now that I’m solo. 😊
My divorce occurred when I was 26 and I dedicated my life to my daughter. Just started dating two years ago, she is now 21. I don’t regret anything and I don’t feel like I missed out on anything either. I’m not saying it was right but I am glad my daughter grew up in a peaceful environment. Maybe one day you can chill with a partner that enjoys life and all it’s beauty. If not, that is ok too. Just know this, nothing lasts forever and this too shall pass.
Sending more virtual hugs. 💞💞💞💞💞
Good heal yourself first 😊 been in your situation
So sorry your going through this. But I’m a firm believer parents that are divorced and happy will allow the kids to grow happy and healthy rather than parents staying together and miserable.
Wow! Britney, you are so brave to share your life so candidly.  1st of all thank you for all the household tips.  2nd of all, I wish you all the best throughout this chapter.
You are wise beyond your years sweet young lady. Wishing you happiness, good health and for the divorce to be over soon for you to get him out of the house. 💪🏼🙏🏼🥰😘😘😘
Youre a beautiful soul inside & out & pray you will heal & live your best life.
15 year fixed term? DAMN that's amazing in NZ it's max 5 years
Yaaas!  I chose the single life almost 4 years ago and it is the best!  I call it choosing happiness!
I wish your family the best!
Thank you for normalizing being single after a breakup!
Please make a longer video on red flags and the orange flags for us ladies who are dating.  Thank you ❤❤❤
Thanks for sharing! I was with my ex for 6 years and had a 4 month old when I found dozens of messages to anyone and everyone. Definitely red flags that I made excuses for along the way. You’re not alone and I know how hard it is to trust anyone and to worry about your children. I hope everything works out in your favor! <3
I can not decide if you gaining views and money off of your husband's downfall is disheartening or plain disgusting. 🤮 God is not above forgiveness or redemption. I will pray for you.
I have been thru this and now  after 51 yrs of marriage I know you can't change anyone,only yourself. He can't change you can he? So its down tp stay or go. according tp what you can live with.
Thank you for sharing this, Brittany. I've shared this with my daughter as I think it's very inciteful and I agree with you 100% ❤
I am sure Ryan cheated on her.
❤
Thank you for sharing this video. I applaud your choice to stay single. I was always my healthiest when I was single, and it wasn’t because I was trying to catch my next man. Looking back, it’s the only time I would actually put myself first.
can I just say!!!  Good for you!!! well done hun!!!  ❤❤❤
I know it might not be something you are ready for but it could be better to talk to Carter about it sooner than later. From what I remember, he has a harder time with adjusting to big changes. Preparing him for it could be better than trying to heal him after. Starting therapy , whether it is family therapy with you and him one session or him and dad another if Ryan is open to that or individual play therapy to have him trusting a therapist with those big feelings when you do break the news. They will already have a relationship built for him to open up. But sooner may be better. Then spending more individual time with them but also making sure to respect each other when you are forced to be around one another with the kids. But if the kids know you will also be able to get Carter excited for things like, two Christmases. Or two Bedrooms to decorate. Maybe he can help dad look for their new place when that time does come and he can feel included. Try not to have him focus so much on time away from you also. What has helped me when my kids struggle with it, (and my daughter is 8, I left her dad when she was 2 months. She never even knew us together but she doesn't like to leave me) My youngest will bring up how she might miss me when she has to spend some time with dad. So I remind her of all the chores she gets out of here when she goes there. 😉 As well as her getting to snuggle her new puppy there and food they both like but mommy doesn't, so they can have those special Stinky meals and all the other things she doesn't get here. I also got her a watch that she can call either of us whenever she wants. I highly recommend that!!! Esp for an anxious babe. It has helped my child feel so much better knowing she has both of us at the tips of her fingers. She doesn't have to ask me or him to call one another and unlike a phone, there are set numbers/contacts and no social media. On another note. I've been single for 3 years since my last relationship and it has been the best thing ever. So much peace. No one to answer to. No grown men to take care of. And I don't see it changing for a very long time. This will be hard for a while but it will be so amazing. Loving someone else is so great, But loving and finding yourself is life changing and so powerful. ❤
You sound like you're on the right track. I'm happy for you for that.
Can you talk about therapy? How does it help you? What do they do in therapy?
I don’t understand why if he still living in the house now you are responsible for your kids expenses instead of both parents assuming the bills (how it was before) UNLESS he already started paying you child support then it will make kind of sense, if “legally” he is allowed to remain in the 🏡 until divorce is final it’s also legally that he need/must keep providing for HIS kids equal as it was before the 💩 hit the fan…..I’ve been divorced and single mom, it’s not easy for us woman, I see your good heart, but don’t be naive OR let others take advantage of you because of your good soul ….stay strong and keep going BUT set rules and boundaries 💡 don’t position your self as a doormat NOPE!
Why Divorce?
You’re so strong!!! You’re a leader for all us women ❤❤❤❤ love you
Normalise being single. Never a more truer word spoken. Coming from a person who is single for 10 years
This is so beyond awkward.
I might be the only one that thinks living together and progressing out/ split family is better. When my dad left i was so sad. I'd rather parents not talk but be there for kids.   I would also be the same and stay single too.
When someone shows you who they are believe them the first time period.
I can tell by your voice how heartbroken and how hard it is for you to discuss these things. My heart goes out to you, and you will be in my prayers as well as your wonderful children. May God bless you and keep you strong through this hard time. ❤
Why are you calling yourself a single mother? You’re technically a divorcee.
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Theory of orange flag is so good!
Great ‘flags’ list ! Hang in there , #ThisTooShallPass
You're experiencing Ascension my beautiful soul. One day you will wake up and everything will just make sense
all the best Britney- everything WILL be ok. you will look back on this as a growing experience. never sell yourself short.
My heart goes out to you. I’ll pray for you and your kids.
Stay single while you have kids at home. Bringing in someone else complicates your children's lives.
Green goodness dressing is the bomb.
🙏❤️
Your poor kids 😢
I rlly felt that… anyway I can support by buying merch  everyone in the comments what are the best products you found?   I know you have skin care line do you also have a make up line?
I took away today… ‘what you tolerate, You encourage’ ❤
You’re such an amazing person & inspiration ❤
Hello Fresh is wonderful.  Using the process I selected meals with my then 19yo and we would cook together.  It was time well spent for both of us. Good saying for you about now "This too shall pass".
New men after divorce? For what? To cook and clean after a full grown man? There are not enough good man out there for all of us
This video,compared to the one from a few weeks ago is like rain and sunshine!!! You look gorgeous and it looks as though you got your vibe back!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I feel the same way. I am not interested in dating.
Omg I didn't know about the divorce😢
I dismiss the saying when two people marry they become one person; Marriage is two people.  You can not control someone else's thoughts and behavior.  Love your blue finger nails very glam.♥
With Ryan still living in the house, it’s going to be very difficult to keep the kids from picking up on the situation. They may not understand why mom and dad are acting different but children are very aware of tension or small changes. I went through the same situation with my ex living in the same house. It’s not easy. Be sensitive to Carters feelings, because he is older and more aware of little changes. If property values are high in San Diego so are attorneys fees. Every little question, telephone call or paperwork adds up and the attorney isn’t even doing the work. Get advice only from people you trust and love you. This isn’t going to be easy.
OMG I was the same way when I got a divorce. I swore I wasn't dating ever again in life. I didn't get into a serious relationship for almost 2 years later. I will say this, do you. If you don't want to date, then don't date. As long as you and the kids are ok that's all that matters. Take one day at a time. May God bless you and your family.
I’m so proud of you!
I missed it.  What happened? 😢😢.  What if your almost ex watches this vid?
Leaving a comment for support, you’ve got this!
Sign I saw once "You never know how strong you are, until you have to be!"  You will come out victorious!!!
I appreciate your honesty. Divorce or a relationship breakdown is always hard for the children. Part of being a mature adult and parent is not being selfish or trying to compete with your ex. You look like you have lost weight through the stress, look after yourself. Xx
Yes! Pay attention to how people respond to an argument!
The tips on red and orange flags are right on.  I have been in relationship that it is always controversial because he doesn't want to understand. He is very opinionated and judgmental and wants to call it honesty. I would chalk it off as assertiveness and even with that you have to be careful.
I LOVE and appreciate you saying we should normalize people choosing to be single
You not wanting to date kinda broke my heart. Sending prayers.
❤God Blessings to you and your children.  To protect, guide and Secure your mental health.   May this situation be over quickly and strengthen you to raise even hight than before 🥰
I wish you all the best stay strong this to shall pass my prayers are with you ❤❤❤❤❤❤
💜💙💚💜💙💚
Who cares 🤢 ...youre a narcissist
I chose not to date for years when I was a single mom but did end up finding the best man and love of my life. Choosing to be single is great, just don’t let the scars of this relationship harden you for good. ❤
Hugssss girl! You GOT THIS!
🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂 wishing all the best fir you. I'm in somewhat a similar position in life
But what happened between them? Like if they only communcate viw text about the kids, they really aren't on good therms?! I always thought they were goals....
All the best to you Brittany! You will rock it!
I know this was not an easy video to upload. Thank you for sharing though. It has given me some perspective in my own life 🙏
Stay together 🙏🙏🙏 You both need to sacrifice yourselves for the benefit of your children and society.
Can you imagine Jesus giving his disciples 3 warning flags then saying you’re in out? The reason Jesus is still being preached to this day is because his love is full of mercy, forgiveness and grace. You know this because we give our own kids this type of love but how can we expect them to have good marriage if we are teaching them a 3 chance rule? I nearly wanted a divorce with my hubby. Our 2nd baby added to our problems but THANK GOD I had good council and that was my pastor who came to talk to me and my hubby. We were given strategies from the bibles advice on how to treat each other and followed by practical advice too. I loved watching your videos because you illuminated such a togetherness type of human quality but you have free will and I pray you get the peace you are after.
So sorry to hear this prayers for you and your family god bless ❣️❣️❣️
I am so sorry you are living through this. Keep focusing on your mental health and keep reminding yourself that you will only accept genuine and authentic love in your life. You are someone who is so likable and so engaging I know you will bounce back. Stay strong.
Brittany, you seem like a good person. I'm sending you good vibes right now. I appreciate your content and find your videos entertaining and helpful. "When people show you who they are, believe them." Why is this so hard? 🥺
You got this!! We love you❤
You’re right to stay single. I split from my ex in March. No desire to date, I got asked out twice today, I just don’t care. I’ve been so traumatized. Guys can’t be trusted. Well most of them anyway. 😂
I've been single for 15 years and celibate for 11. If you enjoy your own company, it's pretty easy and very peaceful. Started dating again a few months ago at age 41 and all the guys who have approached me have been younger, in some cases significantly younger. It's basically like being in my twenties again.
Im sorry for you bc in this video youre  voice has been shacking  the whole time and you look a bit sad. Hope you get better soon😢❤. You are an amizing woman
By the way things are being handled I can tell he definitely cheated. Keep your head up Brit...you are strong and amazing 👏 ❤️
I’m with you, and after many, many years still hold firm: if it happens, it happens but I’m not actively doing anything toward it. Focusing on me,  my kids, my career, my parents is more than fulfilling.
Sending you love 💕 🤗
Such valuable content, Brittany!     Thank you for sharing the wisdom and knowledge you have and are gaining through what you are currently going through.  I’m praying for you all as you walk through this difficult season and into a better one! 💜🙏✝️
You’ve got this, it’ll get better with time.  ❤️
I show my husband your laundry room like once a week, so I’m very glad to know that you’re not moving lol
I'm the same way. 8 years without my childrens father and my sole focus is on my children and not on dating.
Yoire looking super thin, are you sure youre eating enough?
Brittany - great advice and DO TEACH YOUR CHILDREN - Maya Angelou's lesson of "when someone tells you who they are, believe them" is so so critical.  You will get through this, life will get better, hang in there.  M from CT.
Men usually want to control a woman and everything to be on his terms how he wants, so i can see why you don't want a man.
Fantastic Brittney! I unfortunately went through another 8 years of crap with guys after my divorce & I'm done! Riding solo with my kids,  zero gravity, best feeling ever!
I was divorce from my children's father right on the heels of the birth of my last child.  I was not in a good place where I felt I could be by myself. It is better for your children if you can stay single. This is from experience.  I am now (a grandmother) strong enough to stand alone.
You  look so good and happy! I’ve got to know what led to this for you to be so okay now. You’re so strong!! 🙏🏼
Dating in the new world is sooo hard! But you are blessed to have your kiddos ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ nothing wrong with being single
Thanks for your vulnerability and sharing your story.
💔
I'm 31 & I've never been married and I will never be married. People always tell me I'm joking but, I'm not. I came from a divorced home with parents who both remarried and redivorced. It's a no from me. I've been with my partner 7 years too
What a minute, what did I miss? 😮
Definitely agree society needs to normalized women wanting to be single. Women don't need a man to be happy or somebody to rescue us
Proud of you!
Tbh you seem so much happier
I love you Brittany. I'm know it must seem so dark now, but as an outsider I am so excited for you to enter into a brand new and improved life.
Divorce is a very draining experience especially with children.  I have been divorced for 20 years and I met a man about 8 months after I was separated and we will be together for 20 years next year.  I live in Canada and we didn't want to give all of our money and back then we didn't have much and my divorce cost me a total of $750.00 it could easily have cost more but before we contacted lawyers after we had hashed out most of what we wanted to happen so that is why it was so inexpensive.  Best of luck to you and your children.
Pray, give God all your worry’s and he would give you rest. Jesus is all you need.
I still don't understand why people need to say everything about private life. They bring voyeurisme
So relatable. Going through divorce as well and I don't want to date or be in another relationship again, not worth it at all. The potential damage and the risk is not worth it at all. Solo it goes! cheers
I feel every word you said about staying single! If I find myself single again in my life I will be forever staying single. Been there, done THAT! No interest in doing any of it over again.
Sorry this is happening.  Not surprised as you live and air your life online. Boundaries are important.
I think it’s wonderful you’re are focusing on yourself and children. Sending you lots of virtual hugs. 🤗
I relate to you so much! I remember you having carter and I had my oldest couple months apart from when you had him, currently going to be going through a divorce as well ! And having to live together for now, scared but excited to see the future
Amen. I went from hating being single to loving it. I too have seen all i need to see.
You are an inspiration to all! I wish you all the blessings to continue to be the best mom and best me ever!
I don't think there is anything wrong with having him living in the basement for stability of the children. I think that it is fine to just focus on your children.
❤
I think your divorce being costly is related to your situation. I got divorced about 8 years ago and it was like $60 to file the paperwork. That was it. Haha
It's better for the children for you not to date until they are at least 18. It's about stability for them. I applaud you. Veteran teacher here. ❤
Good for you doing what is in your best interest
There is nothing more important to a person's health and well being as a great sixual life. If you find yourself with NO desire in that area, please go get your homones tested...because something is very wrong. Six is at the core of what makes us human. It is a necessity. There are so many physical and mental benefits from that, that can be researched. You'll be stunned.
I think I’ve never seen you so beautiful than in this video !! You’re glowing despite the situation. I guess taking care of your mental health really changed something. Best wishes and I support you ! ❤️
Hi, It takes 1-5 years to get over a relationship situation. Don’t worry about dating right now. …The cost of the divorce is why I suggested a legal separation. …Three chances? Some people give ONE. …Some people need relationship training, for sure—most especially men. You sound VERY strong. Great luck🕊️.
Good for you!!!!!!❤
Break ups and dating are tough.  It's been 7 years, and I'm still sketchy about dating.
At least you did turn off the comment section. I look to you for strength 🙏
Lord I place Brittany and her children in your healing hands. I pray you hold captive their emotions and thoughts and make a new beginning in your light and truth. Be her comforter and provider in this time of need .
I hope you’re not still cooking for him and doing his laundry
I have been watching you for so many years. We've actually gotten pregnant around the same time (I have a 6yr old). And coincidentally, I've separated last month as well and have no plans on dating or remarrying. All the best, Brittney! It's not an easy choice, but you're not alone in this!❤
God be with you through this difficult journey
Brittany, we can make this easier for you! Can you post a link for a go fund me. Specifically for your divorce. A divorce shouldn’t have to cost you so much. It already cost you so much emotionally and it should not cost you money on top of that. If there is anyone here willing to help her pay for her divorce? Please put a like on this comment. Even if every person who reads this comment sends five dollars. That is that much less of a burden.
I certainly hope he is paying the bills while he is there!
Go Girl .. Do what ever makes you and your kids happy.
This broke my heart 😢. I’m so sorry you guys are divorcing. Wishing you, Carter and Capri the best in this hard moment
We have the same real food storage containers. I love it!!! Sending you lots of positive vibes while you go through this life changing season.
I'm so sorry for the kids.   Divorce is so traumatizing for kid 😢  I hope therapy helps. ❤
Informative video!! Do you gave a link for the white makeup brush organizer? Thanks
I’m so sorry for this hard time. But you’re a woman who is so  strong and amazing, you will rise above it and manifest an amazing destiny for yourself..👏👏
You are so strong!! You will get through this and learn so much from it and be better for it. ❤ you are an amazing powerful smart female already but after this it will make you that much more. ❤
When someone shows you who they are BELIEVE THEM! Love that!!!
I feel the same way. My husband and I split 4 years ago and I have had no desire to date. Me and the kids are healthier and happier. You do you. Do what makes you happy. 😊
I really admire you... it takes a lot of strenth to go throught a difficult devorce... you did great, you do great.... but still..... i don;t get why? why you end up like this? if you ever make a video of why... Stay strong girl.. you are very strong alrady...!!!
🙏❤️🙏
So what actually happened? did he hit you? did he cheat?
Sending you TONNS of positive energies and ENDURANCE my dear Brittany ❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
ahaha Brittany you are killing it ahahah , I think te message of dating is  the not right , men love when say speak that way
What kind of curling iron is that? Do you have a link?
Can I suggest you read Love Warrior by Glennon Doyle? I think you’d appreciate her experience
❤❤🙏🏼
Brittany I am shocked to hear that u r getting divorced, I thought u guys were so good together.  I am sorry most of all for the children.  Ryan looked like such a good and funny husband, when did things go wrong?  I wish u good things and know u will come out stronger and smarter.
Stop frying your hair. Get Hairbureon 27 D and Repronizer 27D and why are all these influencers not showing the Lumielina products yet? Gives me shivers watching this last century technology applied to blonde hair girl no STOP!!!! Put that crap in the trash and get Hairbureon 27 D PLEASE!!!!!! @beautytechdistribution and lumielina company LOOK INTO IT NOW!!!!
Hold your head high Britt, you got this. I'm pretty sure I know what happened and you just feel broken. I felt exactly the same and haven't missed a thing but I was in my fifties but being my own person, making my own decisions has been impowering. My kids are my world and I don't need to ever put myself through the pain again. I feel lonely sometimes but a quick walk down memory lane fixes that, lol. Good on you love, you'll get through this and so will the kids because of your love.
I think you are VERY wise not to date. When you're in the middle of a car wreck you need to focus on surviving the wreck, healing,   and raising your hurting children and not focus on what kind of new car you're going to get next. A crass example I know but true nonetheless.  I made a  commitment to not date until my children were out of high school. They're long ago raised now, and we all agree that it was the best choice I ever made. I did it for several reasons 1. My children were going thru the trauma of a divorce and needed me to be stable with my attention fully on them. 2. My children felt secure knowing I would not be dating and that they wouldn't have to live with a new "dad" or within a blended family.  3. I didn't trust my decision-making in regards to relationships, and I and my children needed time to heal.  When my last child was a senior in HS, I met a nice man at church. When he asked me out, I wasn't sure I wanted to date, but I thought  I'd go out on one date and see what it was like to date. Long story short, we married several years later but even then I wiuldve been okay with staying single too.  Hope you can get physically separated ASAP-❤
You are beautiful and smart. The kids are young and adaptable. They’re gonna be fine.
You are indeed, lucky to have so much support and good advice from your followers. Of course, it is your decision, but I would also implore you to look at who he is showing you he is. From what I have heard you say about your ideals and goals, he is not that man. You can change a dollar bill, you can change a diaper, you can not change a person.
@Brittany Vasseur my best friend is going through a divorce and lives in San Diego. There is something she put in for that helps pay for the divorce. She works at a hospital and gets paid very well. If she can qualify, maybe you will too. If you heart my comment, I'll know you want the info. I'll then email you, the details. I'm sorry you are going through a divorce. My best friend is also in therapy and it has really helped.
I wish you all the best. You're going to be okay. It probably doesn't feel like it now, but you're young and beautiful!
Gfrat advice for your kids. Thats the best thing that can commwout of this.... You are smart.
I havent dated for 10 years it was a traumatic situation so i definitely relate to your feelings about not dating. I did date at first but I found it is hard for me to trust and my children are all i need for now ❤ Hang in there 😘
Never dating again isn't dramatic. My great grandfather on one side died early. My great grandmother never dated again. Same for one of her daughters. Her husband passed years ago from cancer, and she's not dated. If I lose mine or we split, I have zero desire to ever replace him. He's the same. We believe you marry once and you marry for love. Not all are like that, and that is fine too. My Mom dated a few guys after she divorced, before she passed. She went through HELL with my father. He beat her and tried to kill her. She almost had her happily ever after, but he died of cancer. I wish they'd have married. She was everything to him. I'm sure their dancing and laughing in Heaven together right now.
I wish you that this period of your life will end soon and smoothly. Be strong and brave 💋.
My daughter and I have been watching you for 9 years, since she was 3… she’s now 12. I too told myself I was never going to start dating again and I’ve decided to live the rest of my life single but my current husband ended up in my life unexpectedly, he was my bestie first, it’s really clinch but the right person come along when we least expect.
I was (am) a very sensitive person whose parents divorced when I was 10. As long as Carter knows he’s the most important person and you back that up with action he will be fine. Sadly that wasn’t my case.
My paternal grandmother got divorced at 30 and never got involved with another man until she died at 74. Whenever I asked her why she’d say men are more trouble than they’re worth. I think she never got over the hurt because she’d go to bed every night with her Mills and Boon books. And in her last five years before she got cancer she had a crush on some guy at the bingo but she refused to talk to him.
I think this is a smart move to not date.  You have to be there for your children.  If you have a strong enough family system, which sounds like you do with your dad and step mom, you don’t have to make a wrong decision to get with some rando guy because you need help as a single mom.  Too many women make the wrong decision to date and bring another man in their lives at the expense of their children.  Once the children are grown, then you can decide whether you want to date again.
I agree with her about the not dating lolll
❤
I hope you will try to resolve this for your kids but it have to come from both of sides 🙏 really hope u can go over this hump … not minimizing this but just love you together 🥰 wish you all the best❤️
So sorry you are going through all of this. You will absolutely date again and find someone to share your life with. Many of us have been through the same thing and thought exactly like you and vowed to never date again but God has plans for us that are good. Many people just like me met someone completely not looking for anyone and they turned out to be the one forever. My husband and i have been married for almost 31 years. We both had been through horrible marriages and divorces. Time definitely heals your heart and when the right one comes along you will be ready. For now pove yourself and those babies and thats all that matters for now. Praying for you!
I’ve been there girl. It will get easier ❤ sending love and light and prayers
I was single for 2 years after my divorce and i was extremely happy!!! My current partner of 2 years basically came into my life unexpectedly so i wasn't even expecting a relationship. Just be you and allow the universe to surprise you!!!
you got this girl!
You can be an encourager for others💗
Girl, I'm saying so many prayers and sending so much love to you.  You are such an amazing woman and a huge role model.  You got this 💪🏽
Thank you for being so open about your divorce and what you are going through.  I know this can’t be easy.  You never know how your journey can help others in a similar situation.
I can see you've lost a lot of weight, Brittany. You'll get through this! Be strong
I wish You balance in everthing 🤗💙
I know you don't want to tell us & I respect that, but I'm guessing he definitely was unfaithful. I've been there. It's devastating.
Love you, Brittany! It will definitely get easier. And Carter - he'll notice the change in you and being more at ease in your everyday life; that will help your kids accept the divorce more readily. XO
You’re Not A Single Mom
Brittany, even though you described everything as a "rollercoaster", you look confident in your decision. You look liberated. and free. You look relieved, as if a weight has been taken off knowing that whatever was an obstacle in your marriage will eventually come to an end. You look excited about what's next for yourself. Yes, what has happened is very sad and not what you had planned for your life. But you also emit a lot of positive energy that cannot be denied. 💕 We are rooting for you bigtime!
Love you my girl, I hope all is well
It is normal to be single. You do you. Enjoy life!
Praying you and your kids will stay strong on this journey.  You have lots of support, so hang in there!  You will make it!
You’re such a beautiful woman and strong Mama. I jpinned your soon to be ex as a narcissist when I first saw him. You’re gonna be just fine. ❤️ I’ve been divorced 2 years with ZERO desire to date.
Prayers girl, I sadly found myself a few years ago a single mother of 4. A wonderful man man found me many years later and we have been married for 18 years now. Go at your own pace.
I’ll always be here if you need to vent, as I’m sure all of your subscribers are. 💕
Re: Dating Again MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY.   You didnt adhere the red flags. Ditto You found out your partner had no adult conflict resolution skills. Ditto  And, not to be jaded, but here in America, you have seen what is out there. In general, Boys arent taught how to be good future partners and to have conflict resolution skills. Particularly in Southern California.
I devorced after 27 yrs and all my children were grown and married.   I dated a little while but along the way decided I didn’t want to remarry.   Then came a time that 4 grandchildren from my daughter’s family needed my love and nurturing thru years of their divorce.   I wouldn’t trade those years for anything.  They are treasured.  I didn’t need another husband.
I visit San Diego a lot and would love to take youth to coffee. Us single girls gotta stick together ❤
New beginnings are scary but awesome.
Britney one of my best friends got divorced like 17 years ago and she hasn’t dated anyone since. It was a horrible situation and she is very protective of her time and energy. Her youngest of 4 kids was like 5 at the time.
This is weird but normal divorce obstacles.
If u wanna heal don’t distract urself every time the thoughts come to ur mind u have to keep going over them in a room alone  that’s how u heal no matter how uncomfortable u are,every time u don’t know why it keeps coming back it’s ur body telling u it needs to heal stop distracting
Some states that since he ain’t working and you r he can file for alimony
Brittany we appreciate your tips and I love the fact that you just made some awesome points- tolerate you encourage. Thanks and lady stay strong I have watched you for years and I will continue to support you.
So proud of you Brittany for being so strong and positive❤ during such difficult times.. Hugs!!
Awesome advice!! Just hit 7 years divorced in June and you're such a strong, smart, beautiful woman inside and out so I KNOW you'll be able to rock this next chapter with ease. The first year is a bit hard just adjusting especially with little kids but with his negative energy gone you'll find you have so much more energy from the peaceful environment.  I remember my therapist coming to my home and commenting how much calmer my home felt once my ex husband was finally gone.
I just left a covert narc n I felt it when u said wut u tolerate u encourage any never again no matter how good the good times are. It was just a facade put on by a monster
You can desire to remain single but be open to what life has in store for you.
Single life should be normalised so much more then it is.. I’ve never been in a relationship and it’s peaceful and I love it! Live your best life as you so see fit! 💜✨ sending you lots of love
Looking really pretty Brittany 💗forever sub- & proud of how strong you are I’ve been there it is like grieving a death! You got this 🙏🏼🫶🏼Sending love and good energy your way!!
❤
I am so terribly sorry this has happened in your life.  I don't know you,  And all journeys are different.  Please continue to meditate as you stated when you began to stress out   I was left with 4 children and no support.  And although, I worked I was just not making enough for child care and the rest of what I and my kids needed.  But truthfully, as I was reaching the end of my rope, I fell on my face and surrounded all to OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST.  NO I AM NOT CHURCH GOER NOR RELIGIOUS.  BUT, I DEVELOPED MY FAITH A DAY AT A TIME  AND OUR LORD JESUS WAS WITH ME EACH STEP, EVEN THOUGH I DID NOT KNOW HIM.  MY CHILDREN ARE ALL NOW YOUNG AND SUCCESSFUL ADULTS, BUT ONLY BY HIS MIGHTY GRACE AND HIS UNENDING LOVE.  YOU ARE STRONG YOUR JOURNEY IS NOT EASY AT THE MOMENT BUT AS LONG AS YOU HOLD ON TO WHAT REALLY MATTERS WHICH IS YOUR FAITH AND YOUR CHILDREN  YOU WILL COME OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE.  Please remember YOU ARE STRONG BRILLIANT AND UNIQUE  YOU WILL SUCCEED  SENDING YOU LOTS OF SINCERE LOVE AND PRAYERS.
Sending you positivity & courage
You gonna make it. When my marriage failed, I was devastated. But now 20 months later, I’m happier than ever. ❤ And wow 6 months? Here in Germany, you have to be separated at least 12 months before you are able to filling for divorce. 😫
Sending you all the love and healing right now  ❤️‍🩹 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ ❤❤❤❤
I have a feeling he hurt you REALLY BAD. Please don’t count out love for the rest of your life. I understand not wanting to date now, but if you close the book on loving someone again, then HE WINS. Don’t let him win
You are so brave, stay strong and close to God.  Prayers going up for you and kiddos!
I’ve been watching your videos since 2014 and I know this is going to be a hard time for you 🥺🤍 this idea isn’t going to be the most popular but it is going to be real… I challenge you to read “The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands” by Laura Schlessinger, and if you still feel the same way, get the divorce with not a single regret. You can read it while you’re trying to burn some time. I love your heart and no matter how this all goes I am praying that you have what’s best for you and your kids and you walk fully in your life’s purpose 🤍
Always remember to never bash Ryan in front of your children.  That’s one of the worst childhood memories for me. 0:32
girl we are all proud of you. If anyone who can pull through this with grace and strength, its you
Brittany, The hacks and tips I've learned  from your channel are numerous and helped me in my everyday life I know how to put on fitted sheet more easily because the tag goes down and to the left. and because of museum putty my dishes no longer fall down in my china cabinet which is beautiful at Christmas when I decorate with lights and poinsettias   and I could name many more.  I want to share something I think is amazing you can eat the chicken spit out the bones with this but please just look at it. today's episode 195 of the empowered wife even if you think no way or don't like the title. Wishing you and your family only the best
Thank you.....I agree your mental health and kids are most important.  God created woman for man.  You don't need a man at this time...when the time is right God will show you the way.  Dating makes things complicated again
We’re all so Proud of you… you are talking to so many women that have gone through or are going through it.  Validating so many emotions for many.  Praying for your peace that will come.
Sending you so much support and love!
Brittany is he still working for you and your company?
Hi Brittany! Long time follower (not OG but still lol) Sending you and the babes love and positive healing vibes! Hang in there! You are precious!
I commend you for deciding not to date in the foreseeable future. The best advice I ever heard was exactly that, if you have children. This time should be centered around your children. It's hard enough for them to understand and come to terms with a divorce. After they are grown, then you can focus on dating, if you want. I'm pretty sure a lot of people will get all up in arms about this, but it has always been my belief and I stand by it. Don't let anyone tell you that you are wrong. I am with you!🕊
I hope this divorce will not affect your business with the sheets and swedish dish cloths.  Stay strong 💪. You got this!
DIVORCE HURT'S & IN TIME U WILL HEAL MY FRIEND...U R GOING THRU A LOT AS YOURE WORLD HAS BEEN TURNED UPSIDEDOWN LITERALLY SO LOOKING TO DATE IN THE FUTURE PROBABLY WASN'T A GOOD QUESTION AT THIS TIME BUT YOU'RE NEW GUY WILL COME INTO YOURE LIFE WHEN U LEAST EXPECT IT! FOCUS ON HEALING, YOURE KID'S & YOU!!   U R A BEAUTIFUL SOUL SO U WILL B OKAY!!!
Riding solo year #16 after a difficult marriage with 2 kids and am sole supporting… and love the freedom❤❤❤ kids are getting ready for / in college… I’m happy and peaceful and thriving… whatever you choose is right for you❤️❤️❤️ deep breath .. day at a time.. ❤️❤️❤️
When my ex and I got divorced I couldn’t eat at all for like 3 months.  But I found my Prince Charming and we have been married for 34 years. We have been together for 37 years.
Everyone get that hello fresh under her name! We all need to rally together for our girl!!! Please support our girl here!!!!!
The enemy has an attack on the Family.  We wabt men to be women and they are not. You can afford help but instead fight with your husband about housework. Wake up. Divorce is money making game and its better for the economy to have single moms because they are spending the most you are being played.  Your husband loves you but you are expecting him to be like you instead of appreciate him for what he is good at. Do you think you are perfect in his eyes. The wrong people are giving you advice.  You are putting your children at a dis advantage
Get back with your husband. You are living for yourself nit God. Wake up the devil is using you. He's a liar and made you see your husband in a negative light to break you up. Wake Up
Sending prayers and love💕💕💕🙏🏻for you and your family🕊
I totally feel you! Been through it too
I totally agree…stay single!  Your kids should come first and you should also put yourself first too! You can get through this!  We’re all here for you.
Hey Carter sounds really smart and intuitive. Unless things were already bad where you your ex weren’t talking within the house and that was your normal, Carter probably already senses something is wrong and different. You may want to consider talking to him about everything before your ex moves out, as that sounds like it may be a while. I don’t at all mean for this to sound negative, just something to think about so you can support him. 💙
If he was the one to end it then he should be man enough to go.  I don't think you will have a choice of being single Brittany because you are beautiful inside and out and there will be a man who can commit. They are not all like your ex. xx
Did she happen to mention why they got divorced?
I will most definitely stay single if I divorce….. I am more than fine being alone.  You are so beautiful and kind and eventually someone awesome may come along for you. Wishing you the very best.❤
I'm a little shocked that people are asking about dating. Dang, let her grieve, heal, and recover from her marriage. That's so much why relationships don't last is because people keep hopping from one damaged state to another.
❤❤❤❤
Yes.. you got that right. Let’s normalize being single. It’s not awful.. best years of my life really. I do what I want when I want. No drama. No need to compromise.  I’ve used Hello Fresh on and off for a few years. It makes life easier for sure. The app is great.  Love your videos! Always great content !
I went thru a horrific divorce and after with him neglecting our child during visits  I swore I would never date again  8 years later I met my now husband of 26 years  We ending up going to court to move out of state to protect her  He’s the best human I know  We had a baby girl who is 25  My girls are 10 years apart and I’m so glad they have each other and a awesome male role model  Good luck to you remember everything changes all the time we go thru ups and downs this too will pass
Love you Brittany! Stay strong, you got this! ❤❤❤
I feel you with the not dating. I've been a single parent for over 17 years and I have zero regrets. I'm drama/stress free. I enjoy my time with my daughter, family and good friends. Stay strong and do you. Praying all goes well for you.🙏💞
So sorry you are going through this  . I have been divorced for 9 years and I can say it was the most difficult decision I ever had to make but the best one for me . I stuck it out for 28 years with four children but nothing ever changed so I applaud you for getting out sooner then I did  .  It was hard on my kids even though they were adults  and for a time I didn’t have there support but I’m happy to say that I do now . I tell you this because your going to get through this . The best thing is patience but you can do this  . Best of luck to you .
God is good. He will restore you and heal you. Everyone can disappoint you but God will never disappoint you. Hold on to His grace, His mercy, His wisdom into this season of your life. It is best to position yourself ourselves into submission to the Holy Spirit to lead and be our guide through this season of tears in your life. Remember: God is Good and He loves you very much!❤️
Never say never. After leaving an abusive narcissist. I moved away and met my soulmate. We had 15 magical years together until he passed away in January. Left me a beautiful love letter and gave me back my happy me.
For people who may think its dramatic or youre missing out - I feel like even if you do not get out in the dating world, if its meant to be it will find YOU. Why waste your time trying to deal with drama and things that probably wont pan out anyways? Id probably do the same thing  Glad you are prioritizing yourself and your well being (well, aside from your kids)
Leslie Vernick is a wonderful resource!!! You tube her. “The emotionally destructive marriage” is her classic. Much luv and support hon!!!
You got this Brittany ❤❤
Thank you
Sending love to you brittany, always. ❤️❤️ ive watched you for years and im glad i get to watch you grow, as well as myself.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you for your vulnerability ❤❤❤
I knew a couple that had the kids stay in main home after divorce and parents sacrificed to move in and out. It was amazing to me - instead of asking kids to split time between homes, the parents did. I think whatever you can do to help the children when this wasn't their choice, the better. Xo
❤❤❤❤❤
💜
I’m sorry that you are going through this. It will take time and living together must be so difficult. Fast forward one year, two years it will get better and better. Dating should not even be thought of right now. Survival is the focus, pray, go to church. You will find strength in Jesus. Again, so sorry this is a hard situation for all involved. 🙏🏽
Honestly, find a friend with benefits! Avoid the drama , you don’t have to answer to him!  But truthfully someone might wander right into your life and  please leave to heart open for someone, just in case!
Gotcha 100%. So spot on (at the end of video). 👌👏
We all need to just wait for the right person God had assigned for us . The Disney love we grew up with thinking we will find love so easily and that’s it …it’s completely fake . Some people will get married and be happily ever after, and for some it won’t happen and we need to be ok with both . Focus on your relationship with Jesus Christ . This society is too obsessed with romance it just doesn’t exist . Dating is a bad idea . Just be happy being single and realize you’re never alone Jesus is on your side .
I missed it. Why are you getting a divorce? Is he a narcissist?
Im gonna follow this red n orange flag  thing .
My opinion is marriage is the problem. I told my kids never marry-live with who you love if that is your choice but keep the gov't and IRS out of it. Look at the long term relationships without marriage. They are happy and stay together by choice and if your energies don't mesh anymore...then separate. Your going to be fine Brittany-really good days are coming for you and your kids.
Single 7 years and happier than ever!! I gave up on dating as well to focus on myself and my girls and I have no regrets whatsoever! A lot of counseling for myself, a lot of figuring out. I am now to a point where in November I am buying my own RV and going full-time RV living and I could not be more excited! You've got this girl, don't doubt it! Or you!
I know you’re putting on a brave face and I’m sure this time in your life has been a huge struggle to say the least but there is this confidence I’m sensing in you maybe that was there all along but maybe hidden…. I have a feeling you’re going to get through this and be a stronger more confident person on the other side. Much love to you and the kiddos ❤
ugh Brittany!  I thank you so much for sharing and being open and honest with us.  You are a ray!!! I absolutely HATE that you and Ryan are going through this as it seemed you two had a beautiful family and marriage. (who cares what we think!)  My husband and I were on the verge but we were able to go though some counseling (never completed, that's another story) but we are still together and just like you said the worst part is worrying about the children.  I just pray it doesn't get too ugly and that the kids can go through it ....with the most amount of love from both parties.  Thank you again for being you and sharing with us because this is hard! Know that you ARE LOVED!!! 💙💙💙
If I (32 F) were to get a divorce I would not date again. I would embrace living my life for myself. Your effort and sheer grit is an inspiration.
Definitely don’t date or bring anyone home until your kids are raised- up and out.   You’ll be a divorced mom not a single mom. There is a difference.
Good idea. Step parents can be a nightmare for kids. So many kids are being murdered by the love life of the other parents. I hope Ryan devotes his life to his kids. Stay close to the kids after living elsewhere. Sounds like you are doing good. We will pray for all of you.
❤❤❤❤❤
There is more to life! Even when you're in a relationship. Choosing to dedicate your time to that "more" is an awesome and completely balanced thought.
❤
As someone who's gone through divorce before, you got this and will be more than ok!! Give yourself grace and time. Also, you are a (s)hero!! Major kudos to you for choosing yourself and your kids! ❤ As a child, I remember always wishing and praying for my parents to divorce because they were so toxic and miserable which affected all of us kids. Needless to say, we had a pretty depressing childhood. My parents didn't divorce until I was already an adult but I was glad that they finally did. Better late than never. Life's too short to spend with someone who isn't for you!! One of the mantras that helped me get through my own divorce was, "It's better to be alone than to be with someone who makes you feel alone." Single life is the best for self discovery - live it as long as you choose to! Another thing that helped me on days when I was feeling down and questioning my own decision to divorce was to make a list of allll the reasons WHY divorce is/was the best thing for my situation. Make this list soon after the decision to divorce before you start to forget all the details why and only recall the good times (cringe). Next, review this list often and especially if you're going through a weak moment where you might want to run to him/text/call and try to reconcile because NOPE you're done putting yourself down so go back and review that list as many times as you need to. When the list has served its purpose you may trash it, burn it, heck - memorialize it, etc. whatever you choose. Remember, you are strong, you are worthy, you are powerful, you can do hard things, you are resilient, you are love! ❤️✨️
Thank you for those words of wisdom. I know it must be hard. But you  will get through it all. You are stronger than you  think. I love you and support!❤
I’ve learned that listening to your gut feeling is the most important in any relationship. I’ve ignored that feeling a few times and got screwed over. Never again. Listen to your gut!
I feel like ALL of us who have gone through a divorce have have said "no more relationships, EVER."  Things change,  you meet new people and your circumstances change.  Just move through your life and be open to whatever happens.
I separated from my husband a month ago because one day all of the red flags just started piling up. As if I was in a trance for the past 13 years. This was caused by a 5 month king silent treatment. I’m 34. No kids. As much as I don’t want to go through dating I would still love to have a great life partner and of course children. It really sucks to start over again when all you knew was this one person.
Sounds like he cheated. Not trying to start any drama that isn't there, but that's what my antenna says. He wasn't faithful. He wasn't loyal. He wasn't  honest. He wasn't  transparent.  He wasn't  all in. You deserve better, Brittany. Stay true to yourself.
I am so sorry you are going through this. I have been through a divorce. It definitely is not fun but you will be OK. You are so beautiful and strong girl you are a sweetheart you got this
Divore does NOT need to be an adversarial situation. Step back mentally and decise what is the point?  do you want to destroy each other, of find a way to make the best of a situation for BOTH of you?  Lawyers want billable hours..NOT what is best for BOTH of you.  Just because MOST people do it a certain way, does NOT mean you have to. there is NO proscribed method. you decide. Do you want to rip each pther appart, or make the best of a situation..for BOTH of you? THer is no RULE that the house MUST be sold. In my case..I opted to remain in the house. The alimony was to pay the house payment, he got the tax right-off..I got the equity, if the house was sold..under MY discresion.  Look outside the box, If you BOTH agree..what judge would over rule that?
I’m so proud of you for sharing this with us❤
Lawyers are the only ones who win in a divorce. If the two people agree on things, you don’t need the lawyers. You can go through the courts without lawyers. If you have differences, you need a lawyer but you don’t need to spend so much. Also, great idea not to be looking for love anytime soon. The new guy won’t love your kids like you do. Sometimes they hurt them. Take it from someone who lived it. Smart move. Maybe you will meet someone down the line later, but it’s better for the kids if you wait. Last thing - we all love you and support you. ❤️
I do not comment much, but you will find someone in your future that will make you pause. Perhaps they will make you want more, perhaps they won't. Do not say never, because you don't know how or what the future holds for you! Thanks for your videos!
The dating apps are TRASH. it’s so bad compared to when you guys met online before. It’s even awful for beautiful and super successful women like you.  Good for you in taking a forever break or a super long break.
You are a winner and will be fantastic on your own.
Brittany I’m. Lawyer in Oc You are absolutely amazing .You have your head on straight much love and good vibs
I command you for sharing such a personal situation and use  it to help other women who might be facing the same issue.  You are a strong and caring person.  Stand tall... kudos!
I completely agree that we need to normalise not having to be in a relationship. It's not for everyone, whether we have been through a related trauma or not. We are all individual people and we need to do what is best for ourselves.  Stay strong x
Sending you love. ❤
Normalizing being single and happy is so needed for our society!!  I’m married and happy and I recognize that is a gift!  Not everyone needs a “romantic” relationship to be fulfilled…family and friends giving support is just as important. I’m sorry your are going through this…but you will be stronger on the other side of it🥰
Been following you for a long long time! You are the sweetest soul, if anyone can do this, its you!!! I’m so happy you are focusing on your happiness xx
I love you.  Hang in there honey!
I am so happy you are not thinking about another love interest.  A man will mess up your head and time schedule.  Carry on and stay focused.❤
I’m proud of you. I know you didn’t make the decision to divorce lightly. And it’s absolutely fine to just be single. I’ve been divorced 5 years now, and I haven’t gone on a date.
You got this! Sending good vibes to you and the kiddos 😊💕
Per the Orange Flag — give them 1  chance. Just one. If they know hey have 2 more times before you actually DO  ANYTHING, they will not be motivated to change immediately.
Brittany I can’t keep my mouth shut any longer, I feel so hard for you and think about what you’re going through daily (which sounds creepy now that I am writing this 😂).  I have followed you since your apartment, from the very beginning and while I will never know exactly what you are going through or what this entire journey has actually been like, there are some things I know for certain:  1. You are a literal DIME. Not because you’re so bubbly and generally likable, but you are winning in so many ways. You have always kept yourself a priority. You look like you did when I first started following you which is wild! Your efforts do not go unnoticed and to think someone was dumb enough to pass on that is absolutely laughable.   2. Your priorities are in exactly the right place. If there’s one thing no one on this planet can argue with, it’s that you are a wonderful mother who puts her children first.   3. You’ve always touched on being a naturally sensitive person, but I truly hope you are giving yourself ALL the credit you deserve for being an absolute badass for keeping your chin up and looking forward even if you don’t feel like it. That is a feat considering what you are going through, all the while keeping your channel a raging success.   4. Sometimes the worst things happen to the very best people, and you are no exception. I see the light at the end of the tunnel for you, even if you can’t right now,  and it will be a brighter place than ever!   Take your time, do what feels right, and congratulations on being strong enough to move forward from what was far beneath what you deserve. So much love ❤
What are you curling 😂😂😂
Hopefully you will not have to pay alimony and child support to Ryan.  Legal bills will be insane, but that support and alimony is a lot of money as well.
Boy did you nail it with the red flags!  People do NOT change and you must believe people when they tell you who they are.  I too learned to run away as quickly as possible when I discovered behaviors I couldn’t tolerate.  I also learned these lessons while going through a divorce
Brit you are going thru so much and I can’t imagine going thru it and living with him too. Just stay strong we are behind you. As a woman of a nasty divorce 30 years ago life does go on I said I would never remarry I was just going to focus on my kids and I was bitter against men as well. But stick to what you have learned from this relationship and make you and your kids the most important thing And the only thing that matters and everything will be fine. You are a strong person. And you will make it thru this, I know it seems hard now but you will. But the sooner you can live apart the better!!!
Brittany, kids are super resilient and won't understand that dad is moving out and won't be around. Tell them dad is working and will see you soon, which is true until they are older and have more understanding. Your children are young and won't understand. Putting too much stress on the situation will make your children wonder why mom is uptight. Act naturally and calm around them.
Been here for a long time and hardly comment. Wishing you nothing but the best and hope your healing journey ✨️ brings new positive opportunities. This is the beginning of a new story. Give yourself grace while closing this last chapter b4 embarking on the new one. We are our worst critics. Feel the highs and the lows..this will get you where you need to be sooner. ❤💕💓xoxo hugs and warm wishes
In all honestly, and I hope I don't cause pain by saying this... I started watching you before Ryan. I kind of stopped watching you a couple of month ago... I was just not vibing with your content or you lately. In this video it feels like you are you again. I don' t know how long you have been struggling but I would say from my point of you, you are getting back to yourself. I cannot point out what it is. I hope this  helps you and encourages you rather than hurts you  ❤ stay an inspiration, you are a strong woman and mother❤
You got this, but I would have kicked him out. JMO.
Thank you for being so open and honest with us. I wish you a lot of healing in this tough time.
YES to mealprepping and easy meals when we're feeling down or depressed! FOOD is essential for us, and almost always too easy to skip/forget when our world is tumbling down on us!
❤️❤️❤️
I didn’t have legal representation for my divorce, I went to court and did a self help situation. They guide you through the paperwork and you only pay court fees. Still about $400-600. I did all my research and was able to split things equally, my Ex just signed. Still had $60K I debt from the marriage. But at least I didn’t have legal fees.
Everything is going to be ok!!! Take care of yourself and your kids, its hard but you are strong woman, go to therapy, go out with friend, make plan with your kids, cry if you need. Travel have fun. Enjoy your life. I decided to stay single too, after divorced. I feel better after 1 year. God bless your family.
Focus on family & readjustment to the new normal… if romance happens after you are all feeling secure… so be it if not then…okay!!!! You are so smart to making your comfort in the new reality a priority! You really do have this! ❤
I never dated and haven’t changed my mind in a lonnng time like 15 years lol do you girl not what others tell you
You are helping so many people ❤
I love your demeanor
It seems it’s always women who sacrifice and give up romance for their family. Guys seem to move on so easily. I hope he at least really loves his kids and is there for them.
Just speaking generally...Honestly there is nothing wrong with being single. A companion should only be an addition to your life but not your goal and having a companion or not does not define who you are as a person. Love yourself, live your life and eventually the right person will come along 💗
I said the same thing when I was getting a divorce that I didn’t want to re marry or be with anyone and boom, my now husband and I have been married going on 12 yrs, you just never know, I wasn’t looking it just so happened it was meant to be 👏
My heart goes to you. i LOVED your quote "What you tolerate, you encourage", You´re absolutely right. YOU´RE GOING TO BE OK. Love, from LIma, Perú
That is the best advice anyone could give another person, very wise. I totally get not wanting to date again, there are many people who make that choice & do so happily, I completely agree we need to normalize being single. There are so many more amaxing, fulfilling, aspects to life, than a romantic relationship.
Yes, her husband indeed is a narcissist. And she is a beautiful strong and successful woman on her own. Sounds like she dated more than one narcissist. When you keeping fall for a narcissist you need to look at yourself learn about what was the problem in you to attract those people. Congratulations Britney, you are growing as your true self.
Britney, you are good for being opening about your decision for staying alone. I am 48, I have been alone for almost 3 years now. See clear and see through the dysfunctions of humanity, which included myself. Now I am much more clam and in peace just by staying with myself. Yes, a person who can have strength to living alone and living well should be the most normal healthy thing to promote. ( again, you must living well by being alone). You must grow up make huge money and get married and have kids must put aside. Why? Because vast of humans are emotionally broken and unhealthy , it just depends on what level of the unhealthy and dysfunctions we are compared to each other. So why? Why you need to bring a person into your life and can’t really do love and can’t really care and be a real partner, and even worse, you bring more kids into this world to continue your dysfunctional dance for their future. Why?! Tell me why? Is it because you want your karma not only blocking your blessing in your life but also have your kids continue that curse?
I am curious why people use lawyers to file can’t file ourselves?
I'm 60, been flying SOLO for 20+ years  After several pathetic attempts at marriage / long-term relationships I realized no one's going to put in it what I do, there's always going to be an inequity and I'm not willing to live with that  People don't know how to be loyal or committed any more  I will share with you one interesting aspect.....  Once you get older and everything starts 'going south' that is not a good time to change your mind bc you don't have the same power you once had  Just make sure that you know and that you're in for it for the long haul  I thought a couple of times I had changed my mind and considered dating again and then I LAUGHED 😂 😂 🤣 🤣 and got over it
You will come out of this stronger and healthier and it will be a huge success for your kids
Hey sweet lady, I'm praying for you & this whole situation. I got divorced many years ago, but it was waaaaaaay cheaper then what you are talking about. Me & my X have a daughter together & we agreed to be civil & friends which we still are. That was 20 years ago too. I believe the whole divorced was only like 500 bucks! We did irreconcilable differences. My lawyer got the judge to sign off on it & stamp & approve it & that was it. We agreed on every other weekend for him to get our daughter & every other holiday but we actually worked it out where she saw him every holiday & me too. I was very fortunate to have good people as an x mother in law & x husband. We just decided to be civil for our daughter. I don't know your situation tho & not sure how I would be if it was a situation where I got hurt really badly. Love you hun & I'll keep you in my thoughts for sure!!!
Thank you for talking about choosing to be single. I have been single for 9 years since my divorce and I love it. I have tried married life for 22 years, but I prefer being on my own, with good friends and family. But most people do not accept it.
You should try to work it out with your husband. It would be better for your children. Seek help through marriage counseling with a Christian organization. I would try everything before you break up your family. Read the Bible, put God first, then your husband, then your children. You won't regret it. If he cheated on you, find a way to work it out if he is remorseful. Forgiveness is for you. Once you forgive someone, it frees you up to start over. If you can live with him now, there is no reason to break up your family. Your children will thank you one day. This is wisdom from a 60+ year old who reads the Bible and practices life God's way, which is the best way. I became a single Mother and I regret it. I should have sought help. I will pray for you and yours.
I 💯 understand not being interested in ever dating again. I felt the same way after my first marriage. You do you.
Hi happy that you’re taking your time on finding love for you again but not now. I was going to the same back in the 90’s but Cupid had other plans for me . This second time around I’m pleased on how my life turned out and how we are still married now for 25 years . Don’t rush into anything that you don’t want or need in your life right now. Just be patient and there for your kids right now. Good luck with everything and stay strong and be happy.
🙏🙏🙏🙏♥️♥️♥️♥️
I just finalized my divorce on April 11. We were lucky that we were never able to have kids, so it was a bit easier for us. You are right, my ex showed me who he was and I ignored things. I'm not ever dating again, but if I decide to, I'll be prepared.
Keep doing what you're doing for you and your kids❤
how do you clean your brushes
I love your videos, they are so real and honest. I really think you will meet someone new when you are ready. Take your time and like you say enjoy your kids and focussing on your own health. All the best. Sending hugs
First and foremost, I am so sorry that you’re going through a difficult time. You’re such a genuine and strong women. I don’t know you personally but every video you post that is the impression I am left with. This video really resonates with me and the difficult time I’m going through as well. Thank you for casting light on others, just remember to save some for yourself , too. Much love! 💜
Hi Brittany!   I totally agree with you about NOT dating.  I wish all single mums would consider that to be a solid decision.   When you have children, it's the best thing to do until they're of age.
It's good to see you happy & making your way through this difficult time. You're a strong woman & you're going to be fine
I think you absolutely have the right idea by remaining single, focusing on healing and your babies. You have an excellent support system.
Brittany,  I have been through divorce and cancer as well.  It is life-changing but there is only one thing that can get you through and give you peace and comfort and that is having a relationship with Jesus as your Lord and Savior.  I am not religious, I have a relationship with Christ by surrendering my life to him and repenting for what I have done,  non of us are perfect.  I now live each day in His peace, love, joy, and grace.  I am praying for you.  I've enjoyed watching you for a long time.  Take care, Hillary
What’s your go-to salad order?   I agree that we need to normalize being single. I was single for most of my adult life until I met my first real boyfriend at the age of 28. After my moms divorce she decided to remain single like you. I think she feels the same way as you. You are not alone.   Sending you my love and support! ❤
Stay positive and strong the most important person is you 🙏
Did you see red/orange flags even before marriage?
Single by choice here, caring for my adult disabled son.
I feel like you are communicating so much with us …without putting specifics. My heart hurts for you. Sending hugs ❤️
Brittany, you will know if you are ever ready to date again, and if not, so be it. After I got divorced, while raising my 3 & 5 year old children, I chose not to date mainly because I didn't want any drama in my kids' lives. I was single by choice for 16 years, no regrets! 👍
I chose to not date and dedicate myself to my child 12 years ago and it was the best decision. My daughter turns 18 this year and we are the best of friends. You will do great!
I just discovered you,I think you are extremely smart and intelligent,so sorry for what you are going true, I was 40 when I divorced and did not want to date, I was very happy with my decision, good luck things to get better Take care
If you have a bad day, just be yourself. Its a tough tough situation and be good to yourself💖
When I divorced 10 years ago in the state of MS, it was $1,000 non contested, or $2, 000 contested. Thankfully, there were no kids involved, so we were able to not have to bring it to court. I'm sure CA is much more expensive though.  Stay strong Brit! You may feel like your whole world is collapsing, but you'll feel so strong and light once you get through it💛
I can tell you only care for your children. The rest is secondary. You are a great mom !
It takes a lot of courage to walk away from someone you love. ❤ I'm proud of you my friend. Now is the time to focus on You and your sweet kids. Focus on taking care of your mental health is so important. I pray it doesn't take years and years.
I love being single, and don't want to date right now and ruin my peace. I've never been married, but I had a 7 yr relationship, then a 6 yr one, 2 yr, etc. I can last a long time with someone, but I'm not the marrying type. No kids. So it's tough when you love your freedom & peace, to have a partner that will still give me that.  Take your time and enjoy your single, peaceful time. xo
If you can shop around for other legal help , try. I’m in San Jose , Ca and I paid $750 for my divorce years ago. My ex husband and I were not getting along at that moment either but we used the same attorney and they handled the custody as well
Hi i actually listened twice as there are so many between lines I read! Omg I think the current living situation says a lot about this marriage and about how it went all downhill! I feel there will be a long run and I have to wright this message in a way where everyone can read it!!! I really hope you will have this divorce completed soon and I hope it all works as planned! Would it help to have a plan B? In case it takes years … would you be able to live in current situation like this ?!? Sending you strength and positive vibes!🌸
Thank u for sharing this with us🥺
I love you ❤️
Best decision I ever made was to be on my own.  I've been very happy on my own after spending waaay too many years giving waaay too many chances to someone that really mistreated me.
You are very real and genuine and I really appreciate that about you! So proud of you for not taking the easy route, super difficult and expensive but worth every penny in the long run! Your daughter will thank you later for being a strong woman role model, and your son will thank you for teaching him what’s acceptable and u acceptable behavior for a man to treat his wife.   You rock!
Do you all sit down for dinner together at night? If so, what do you talk about around the table?
The Only winners are the divorce attorneys- I had to get rid of my first divorce attorney after she said "I'll do the thinking for you" nope next ,remember every time you talk to them they are charging you and you may have to change attorneys work out the details regarding  children, finances, house etc. beforehand with Ryan otherwise it's cha-ching-you need to keep as much of your money as possible. I hope only the best for you during this difficult time Brittany
You’re so wonderful Brittany❤Hurts me someone would hurt you. Praying for you ❤🙏🏼Please start reading the Bible .
Brittany, girl- you look hellagood! You look so hot, so toned. I once heard the best revenge is living well or success without your ex. I hope your new life brings so much joy with your kids. Your kids are so lucky they have such a strong woman as a mom. ❤❤❤
Yes, I hear you. It’s more expensive to get divorced then to get married. I ended up representing myself in my last several motions and saved thousands of dollars.
Hang on there, Sweetie! One day it will get better and better 🌹 You deserve the best!
It’s healthy and smart to take a long break and heal after a major relationship ends. Too many people rush on to date others and hurt themselves and others in the process.
I don’t know if making this video is going to help your situation while it’s going on and therefore your kids. Also I wonder how they will feel when they see this video one day. Maybe it would be best to not share as much until things are said and done and you’ve had time to calm down and reflect.
Its a little soon to think about dating dont you think? From what you said you just filed for a divorce. You have a lot to deal with before your ready for that,  You and Ryan are still living together and you haven't told your kids yet. You cant fool kids they pick up on everything.  I have been thru a divorce with a young child too. I chose to remain  single, I love my peaceful life.I prefer my life this way.  Good that you're in therapy it's a safe place to let it all out,  it will help. but its okay to be sad too its part of a divorce process. Take your time slow down girl... relax your mind, remember one day at a time. With every good wish  for you Brittany and your little children.🌷🙏
I am reading now 8 rules of love from Jay Shetty - great book! Can only recommend!
I don’t normally comment on videos but…. I just want to say that I’m very proud of you for choosing not to date immediately and recognizing that you and your kids will need counseling to work through the feelings of dealing with this difficult situation. ❤️ As a divorced person I know it’s really easy to blame our former partners for everything wrong in the relationship but it’s very important that we also take the time to address how we contributed and to work on those behaviors before we enter into another relationship. Kids, no matter their age, also need a safe place to work out their feelings and emotions. If we date too early the introduction of a new parter or partners can be really difficult for them….sometimes parents don’t see that because their too involved in their own happiness or unhappiness. I wish you all the best in this journey….my divorce was very tough but ultimately my life is so much better than if I would have stayed in the marriage. 💕
He must’ve cheated!!! It’s clear how she says she doesn’t wanna date. And how they don’t talk just via text
SO Proud of you.... I also wouldn't date anyone ever again if I got into a divorce. Thinking about all the BS of dating and getting to a relationship and having to do everything all over again sounds exhausting, so I agree with you on that front. Focus on yourself and your kids <3
He will definitely realize his mistakes, and will be begging you back 💯 (they don’t change). Protect your mental health at all costs 🙏🏻❤️
If you are with someone and you find yourself saying …. “If only” they did, didn’t do , etc, that’s your clue to exit stage left ASAP.
Good morning beautiful,🌞🦋💜 You are doing a great🙏🏻❤️ You are such a good mother, and a great woman 🥰⭐️💫🌟🙏🏻 I absolutely agree with everything that you are doing. ❤️ Definitely stay focused on your children, and most importantly yourself. You got this🙌🏻🙏🏻❤️💖✨🥰🦋💜🙏🏻
Ive been divorced since 2019. I was married for a total of 33 years.  I never wanted to be divorced either. But for the last 10 years of our marriage and possibly even more. I had the warning signs you spoke of and i wish someone would have pointed out that to me then.  He sorta waited till our dauggter was in college to really begin showing me who he really was so our only child wasnt a small child but it was in college she developed anxiety issues and maybe she saw it coming before I did.  I dont know for sure.  Anyways, ive been divorced for 5 years now and im making it on my own and i feel the same way about relationships you do and dont want to ever date or get in one again.  But im 63 years old and you are young and beautiful and im positive youll change your mind.  Just see comfort in God and His Word the Bible right now it has truly helped me.  Get your kids involved in church and they will always know who to turn to when they are stressed and worried.  People there will be a great support for all of you.  You will get thru this and i get the financial stuff too.  Im still amking payments on my divorce lawyer.  So hang in there you are in my prayers.  ❤
I’m praying for you and Ryan also. Jesus is the God of healing and miracles!
Very wise of you to plan on being single, possibly permanently!
Ive been telling linda to f...off 😊
Bless you.. it’s not easy and I’m so sorry! Take each day to work on your mental health.. saying prayers for you and the kids! There is life after all the trauma! 💛
Hopefully the divorce finalizes soon so you dont have to spend so much on those fees. I know you say you just want to be single, I think the only reason ppl push us to not be single is because they think we all need a companion/ second half they dont want us to be alone. As long as your kids are with you, you will not be. I see no rush to date. If years later down the road its something you want then i would go for it but understandibly that is probably the last thing on your mind
Hopefully you can come to a mutual agreement before the legal bill's get too high 😢 stay strong you have got this
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Big cuddles ❤’Have been single over 20 years, it’s lovely if you’re fortunate enough to have caring companionship and friendship, and then maybe further, but aside from that it’s better being single (as a woman). In the U.K we have something called “Mediation” away from lawyers but the agreements stand legally? Anything like that in the States? It’s better for the kids (in theory) as it’s not “adversarial”. (‘Used to work as mainly matrimonial legal secretary in London years ago). Mediation is done through advice charities here so much cheaper.💕xx
As a child of divorce who was put in therapy by my parents, I would highly suggest starting the therapist now if you haven’t already. They don’t have to be talking about the divorce. But by the time you’re ready to tell Carter, he’ll be familiar and comfortable with the therapist and it won’t be a new thing. He won’t look at it as something he had to go do because of the divorce, it will just be something he happened to be doing when he found out. Hope that makes sense! Sending you love! Post all the sponsored content. We’re here for it!
❤
You are not Damaged!!!! Someone hurt you two different things ❤
If Carter is going to public school and you have not told him yet, you need to tell him because you’re a public figure you don’t want him finding out from the other kids at school because you shared this with us on YouTube
I wish I had your advice 40 years ago. Everything you said about warning signs hit home with me. I finally left, and I am now with the man I alway wished for and deserve. Pleases ladies this is sound advice,listen.
Hi sweetie I'm in shock,I cannot believe. You guys were a beautiful couple,but I get it.
I just ended things with my kids dad as well, it’s so refreshing to see these videos.
Love you girl! I’ve watched you since you started! You’re beautiful and I pray things can go smooth!
Thank you for sharing with us. You will be okay. I’m wishing healing, peace, and joy for you and your children.❤️
Thank you for sharing <3 I love that quote. "When someone shows you who they are, the first time, believe them." So powerful. In my personal life I tend to make excuses for toxic people/behaviors and stick it out hoping they will change. (They never do!) I also have issues trusting my own instincts or feelings becauce I worry I might be overreacting or imagining something. But in hindsight, usually my instinct was right. Being in a relationship with a toxic person is so draining and bad for our health. It's important to get out of something toxic and not neglect ourselves. I needed to hear this. Hope you're doing alright, Brittany.
I’m right there with you with the dating. Just enjoy you and spending time with yourself. 💛💛
I am married but have to say my divorced friends though rough at first, I noticed started doing things they had wanted to, growing as an individual...free and happy
Omg I never expected that. I am also divorced 💗 it definitely isnt easy. Sending love.
Be well and happy Brittany 🥰
What a good job you’re  doing—for yourself and your children! Am holding you in Light and Love.
Brittany, maybe you will find some advice or a solace in a book Slay the Bully. I wish you all the best!
Okay. Wow. I'm still shock about your divorce and sorry to hear, but at the end of the day you have to do what is best for you and your children. I really can't blame you about the not dating again. I pray for you and your family and wish you the best. Thank you for sharing.
Good for you your situation sounds like my past situation. Those are all signs of dealing with a narcissist. I wish you all the support love strength and success during this process and after. You are amazing brave and strong. There will be very dark days but just try your best to stay focused and at the end when your divorce is final you will be able to feel free and so much better and confident in your decision. ❤❤❤
Britany, never say never
I went through a separation and divorce years ago,. Focusing on my children kept me moving forward to what finally is a calm happy life.  Dating, I chose not to date too. I did not want to put that added pressure on me or my children.  Stay strong and focused, you can do it too.  Therapy will most definitely help. Sending love to you and your little ones.
It's ok, girl...I've been single for almost 10years after a 13-year marriage. My thoughts and prayers are w u and ur family!!! Hang in there ❤
look after yourself  with love
Brittany, you are such a strong, intelligent, beautiful and hardworking person and I wish you all the best that life has to offer. I hope that things move quickly and smoothly for your sake. Much love from Canada xo❤️
Is Ryan dating someone?
You're such an inspiration and amazing person, I understand that you are going through a lot right now ❤ That's why it's so amazing to see you continuing to share and probably help a lot of people in similar situations. I really believe in you, thank you for this amazing channel and I will keep following you for more great advice and inspiring thoughts.
Ciao Brittany, grazie per il grande esempio che stai dando a tutte le donne che tollerano situazioni in cui non si trovano a proprio agio e non hanno la forza di decidere il meglio per sé!!!! E grazie per tutti gli importantissimi consigli 🥰 sai ho sempre voluto provare HelloFresh e il tuo codice sconto è importantissimo per me!!!! GRAZIE!
I’m a paralegal and I worked in family law which I hated. It’s horrible but honestly, Family law attorneys rip you off. The retainer is ridiculous and they charge an absurd hourly rate and do nothing. They drag everything out. Brit you are amazing and strong. Love you. You got this!!! ❤
I’m so sorry you had to go through the drama. But I’m so proud of you because you don’t make it about a guy.  You are more than you know and more than enough. ❤God bless you.
Oh my goodness. I’m so sorry to hear about this. I haven’t been on YouTube in forever due to a divorce of myself. I pray yours go quicker than mine. Keep taking care of you so you are there 100 for your children as well. Xo
Sending you strength & prayers for this trying time.  I’ve been through a difficult divorce myself & then had to raise my 3 kids as a single mom.  You are doing an amazing job.  Have faith that everything is in the process of working out for the better.  Blessings! 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Your ex husband should be paying your legal fee because all of this is his fault. It makes me sick that you have to deal with all of this, when you seem like such a genuine, lovely person who clearly loves her children so much. That guy wrecked this beautiful family and he should be ashamed.
I love you girl! Stay strong!
soooo in conclusion he cheated on you , he managed to cover it up the first time but you knew deep down inside then it happened again and he got caught.
Ohhh... That's rough having him still under your roof. Do you still cook for him and have dinner together with the kids? Does he do his own laundry?
I don't think any person is perfect in a couple or single. As long as you have common goals with and for the kids thats what matters.  Marriage is hard due to society's "norms" but our upbringing affects our lives whether we like it or not. Good luck and best to both of you.
Love you! I’m SO glad you are prioritizing your mental health.❤❤❤
I left my ex-husband in 2014 and divorce finalized in 2016 (LA County). My kids were 5 and 2 years old at the time. I still haven’t dated and I’m totally fine if I never date again. People don’t understand it but once you’ve been pushed to the edge and have had a mental breakdown, you do not care about dating. All I care about are my children who are now 14 and 11 years old. People will say… that’s not healthy. I do not care.  I lost my house (the one I bought before I even met him), my 401k, savings, and it cost $150k in legal bills. I’m in huge debt with the IRS. It’s terrible. If you haven’t gone through it, you’d never understand.   Praying for you and sending positive vibes for love and healing ❤️‍🩹
I’m proud of you Brittany!  Your definitely a strong independent women. Sending you positive healing vibes. 🦋🤍
Brittany, I watched this last night and I can’t stop thinking about you. I’m so sad for you, I know this the last thing you would want. I have been in your position and can reassure you that in time, with a positive outlook, you will see that it is not the worst thing in the world. You will survive and grow and so will the kids. It’ll be ok I promise. Love from me in England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 xxxx
Keeping you and kids in my prayers. You will get through this.
Do what you feel comfortable with on your new journey. God bless you.❤
Forensic accounting???
🥰
girl I've been single for 2 years - it is GREAT!!!!  Focus on yourself and your joy!  I wish you well
😽
Sending hugs 🤗
I’m with you 100% Brittany.  I am so happily divorced of 3 years.  I have 3 amazing young adult children, lots of gorgeous girlfriends and absolutely no desire to ever date again.  Of course we never wanted divorce for our children but not everything works out in life.  Be very kind and gentle with yourself. 💐💕 Hello from Australia.
Girl get ALL. Those brand deals! Do what you’ve gotta do ❤
❤❤❤
One more thing...go out into nature, take a walk just sit. LISTEN, nature was made for healing our souls, eveything has a purpose.
Make him pay for all of your attorney fees, since the divorce is caused by his actions. Things are going to be great, trust me. Kids are so resilient. keep it positive ALWAYS and have contol over the Narrc. ❤
That is a strong woman ❤
💋💄
Still praying for you.  You look lovely today.
What did I miss ?!?!
Be careful about looking like nothing is wrong. My best friend did that for 6 mos and the kids thought everything was good and when the dad moved out they were mad at her! Hope you don’t go through that.
You’ll be ok Brit💖💖💖. You’re strong, beautiful and talented!
Arghhhh I can’t believe you have to let him live there. I was lucky that I didn’t have to do that but he kept sneaking into the house and stealing things. I had to change the locks. I’m sorry you have to have him under the same roof.
I want you to know that I appreciate your sharing.  You are a beautiful person inside and out!  My best to you and your family.  I believe you know best what you need...hugs sent your way!
Continued prayers for u and ur family. ❤
How are you living with him in your house? That sounds really hard. You are so strong and beautiful… you will help a lot of women with this content. Xo
Britt you seem the most yourself and like so much weight has been lifted off of your shoulders! Here’s to you thriving in your new era sis xo 😘🫂🫶🏼
❤️❤️
Such good gems of advice! Thank you  Brittany! Sending you warm hugs in these difficult times.
Brittany how can we support you financially in this? Engagement? Does clicking on the link help? Giving Thumbs up? We want to help!
You are a sweetheart and I wish you the best.  xoxo
I tried the link. I have to pay before I get to pick out my meals? Ya right
Thank yuh YouTube aunty ❤
Praying for you and your kids through this difficult time. Divorce is one of the most difficult things to go through. I spent big bucks  $$$$ trying to hire CPA’s, attorneys etc to sort through income, assets, housing, kids you name it. But in the end, the judge didn’t even consider my info or documents, he/she ruled in favor of the attorney he liked best. It sounds crazy but there is a whole world behind the scenes that most of us know nothing about. Choose wisely as the attorneys are the only people that win in divorce. They can extract everything you worked so hard for and not bat an eye. Oh and remember your attorney and your husband’s attorneys might be friends and drum up ways to get more money out of you by non stop court hearings. They charge $$$$ per 15 mins so don’t waste your time chatting about the weather. Hugs!
Lovely video Brittany ❣
You are exactly right about when someone shows you who they are...believe them?  I have been the victim of covert narcissistic abuse.  I knew something was wrong but i ignored my intuition.  I won't do that again.  I don't know if you are dealing with narcissism but if you are I definitely can relate.  These people never change and the disorder cannot be cured.  Every single article i've read and every video I have watched say all you can do is walk away.  Love yourself.  This is the most important thing to remember.  Hope with time you completely heal from this.
❤
Chin up sweetheart. Things improve. It’s just the way of things. Sincere thoughts.
I can relate. My husband and I are on the brink, and there's no way I'd ever get involved with someone again. 33 years has been enough. lol
Such good advice❤
GREAT VIDEO BRITTANY!!!   I DID THE EXACT SAME THING WHEN I WENT THROUGH MY DIVORCE.   YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK.   YOUR LIFE WILL BE BETTER IN THE FUTURE!!!!!  YOU ARE DOING A TOTALLY AWESOME JOB!!!!
You will know who you TRULY are during this difficult time... and I am POSITIVE that you will find strength and courage that you did not know you had... and a self esteem that is stronger than you thought possible. This is where we learn the most about ourselves... through the trials. I truly believe that you will be an even more amazing human being (if that's possible!) going through these hard times. You are not alone. You are loved. And you are enough. You are up to the task. I KNOW it!!!
Big fan of yours- sending good vibes! Remember your lawyer will charge you for every conversation, don't vent to them! You've got this, smart woman!
I really like the idea of normalizing being single!
Do something radical and get your hair cut much shorter?!
You look great, Brittany!!!, btw!!! Glowing!!!! Happy!!!!!
My motto:  "No regrets, only lessons to be learned."
You need to find Jesus Christ . You are right about your kids and your self.
You are sooooooooo smart! Love your mindset!!!!!!! Hi from Maui !!!!!!
Please when you’re ready share why you are getting a divorce, so much guessing going on. 😘
Congrats on single• momming it!!
Support squad in full force here! 💖
I don’t think your crazy for saying you don’t plan to date. If the right person finds their way to you, great, but you don’t have to spend your whole life chasing romance. We as people are more then romantic partners and we aren’t less for not having one. I think people are just scared to be alone sometimes, but if you can’t* love yourself how can you expect someone else to love you the way you deserve. Good luck Brittany, I am sure times are and will be tough, but you have an amazing head on your shoulders and two adorable kiddos. You got this! 🖤
Once you get through this and are out the other side of it, it will be a great relief for you and you will find freedom you never knew was possible. You can now rebuild your life on your own terms. Your children will be fine in the long run. Kids are resilient. I will pray for you, Brittany.
She didn't respond to when she knew it was over??
❤❤❤
Brittany I too bought my house with my husband at the time in Chula Vista and started going through my divorce in December 2018. My divorce still isn't final because he wants half of the house. My legal fees so far is about $10,000 and we still have trial in May of 2024. My heart breaks for you because my son is very sensitive too and he is now almost 7. It has been almost five years for me and I don't feel like I can ever be in a romantic relationship again either. If you ever need to talk or ask questions please let me know. I hope your process goes away smoother and faster than mine. My heart hurts for you so much.
I hope he moves out NOW. Stay strong. Life will be better than ever soon ❤
This is completely normal not to date any one again. Especially when you are truly hurt. When I watched your video about the divorce it so shocking for me. My prayers are with you. Hopefully things get better.
I’m so glad you’re taking care of yourself especially your mental health. I love your videos.
Wow he living in the house 😳😬 you are strong. Sending you all the positive energy and the kids
You guys are communicating very well you should do an uncontested divorce as long as it's fair. It will not cost you hardly anything both of you. Lawyers going to drag it out both lawyers.
My parents never divorced because of stigma.I lived 14 years in a broken household with arguments,abuse,cheating and struggle,then my mom died of cancer and I lost all my emotional support and the only love I felt.I'm 30 now and there has never been a day in my life that I haven't wish for my parents to just had divorced.
forensic accountant?! :( do you recommend splitting assets and getting a prenup before marriage?
Hello fresh really is the bomb! Plus you learn new cooking techniques and skills with it that you can use over and over again even when you don’t get a box! Factor is also really good if you haven’t tried it. My husband always orders them when there’s a discount code and they’re awesome. No cooking, they’re fresh, healthy meals, and they reheat from frozen just fine (even when they’re meant to be in the fridge. But we got like 24 meals the one time and HAD to freeze them lol. They were still delish and fresh tasting!)
❤❤❤ You were created to be loved and respected. God is with you! 💟🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 Sending love from Minnesota!
One of the best pieces of advice I got was split the retirement accounts before the divorce decree because it will cost extra to chase money later.
You are so correct on the flags
“Be careful what you tolerate, you’re teaching people how to treat you”
Yeah, feeling like you never want to date or have any romantic relationships going forward is a clear sign that you've experienced Narc Abuse.   Bless your heart and soul... may your healing journey be filled with gifts and wonder beyond your wildest dreams 💖
I have not dated since my husband left in 2014. I'm not sad! Couldn't care less😁  You're good girl please don't be bothered by that
Dating in SoCal as a woman will put you off dating forever
This was an AMAZING video! Thank you for being so honest. This can help so many In that in between phase before the kids know.
Can you use that code if you live outside US?
After a divorce it’s hard when you are scarred to trust again.
You will be okay. Easier said than done, right? However, I believe that you will persevere through this. There will be many challenges. No doubt you’ll be up and down. But one thing I can promise you is, you’ll come out stronger on the other side. And I suspect one day you will reflect back. And yes, there’s nothing wrong with being single it’s your choice at the end of the day. However, lol I will tell you that sometimes second love comes knocking when you least expect it. Just saying I have huge mad respect for you, and you have a lot of people in your corner cheering you on in your next chapter. ❤
Brittany, it takes a lot of courage, to do what you are doing.  My late husband and I had our ups and downs. We separated for a little bit and got back together. We still struggle alot. I put up with way more than I should of. I was raised way different back then. I did truly love him with all my heart and soul.  Now that I look back at things my children are struggling. Because we always was arguing and fighting about little things that didn't matter.  I am glad you all are going to counseling and you are putting you and your children first.  I wish I had your strength and courage.
A divorcee shouldn't give marriage advice...this is my divorced experience. People are out there staying through thick and thin and they should give the advice.
So, so ▶️ Brittany...When someone shows you who they are believe them the 🥇 time. Maya Angelou said this years and years ago. Read her stuff Brittany you will 💕 it. Blessings to you and your absolutely beautiful children.
You’re a phenomenal woman. You got this mama. One moment at a time. ♥️✨
It sounds like there was some infidelity going on.
Brittany, you are one of the sweetest, most genuine people on the internet. I'm so sorry for what you are going through.  I just want to give you a hug.  Hang in there.  Ignore the hurtful comments and do what you need to do for you and  your children. You're pretty amazing!  Rely on good friends, family and God to help you through this. Love you beautiful lady!
Perrriiioood!👌🏻✨ Stay strong!💪🏻
You are awesome and I pray for the best for you and your children!!!  You’ve got this!!
You are the sweetest most giving of your life with your fans ! I would not date either!
Brittany!!! What the heck?!! 😮  This is my 1st time hearing this.  I...what...I'm so sorry to hear this.  I pray all good things for all of you.  You guys are the couples that I never would have guessed this would happen to.  I'm sorry.
Commenting here to support the legal fees. Go Brittany! Love.
If I ever was to loose my husband, I wouldnt get with anyone especially  while my kids are small. These predators be playing games to get to your kids.
Girl, you're drop dead gorgeous. After some time has passed you're going to begin to notice all the men begging for your attention. Of course you're saying you wanna stay single. You're only now beginning the healing process. And you're so young. Maybe you'll change your mind later and allow love back into your heart one day. But hey. Being single is okay too. As long as you have your kids and your family, nothing else matters. I'm a single mother and love my time spent with my family.
Happy to see your bright bubbly self even through this difficult time. Praying for you as you and your family continue to grow and heal during this journey. 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
❤❤you do you. Take care and have fun. You both will have to talk to the kids soon.❤❤
Praying for you and your kiddos!
What I learned from my divorce, you have to learn to be happy with and by yourself before you can ever really be ready to be with anyone else, being in a healthy relationship with another person, really requires you to be healthy on your own first. When you get to this place you are no longer baseing relationships on fear, but on partnership.
My sister is currently going the the same with the living arrangement, with her husband. According to GA law, he can stay in the home until the divorce is finalized. He wants the divorce, so why stay there? It's just crazy to me.
So glad you are getting all the help and support you need . Also glad that you get to stay in your house.  Big hugs
I’m so proud of you Brittany ! You’ve got this! Yes that must be hard living in the same house for sure! Take care of yourself!🙏🏻🤗🥰💗🌷
M heart is just breaking for you. You are showing us such a brave front. Do let us know what else we can do to support you so that YT pays you more….like, comment. I’ll do with every video. I hope it helps. And sweetie, you are young, vital & beautiful. How many times did I see one of your videos & think - oh, I wish I looked like her when I was that age? You will find your groove & get back in the saddle again. Don’t make absolute statements & try not to think about when it will happen. It will happen organically. Focus on you & your gorgeous children & sending you virtual hugs
I hope one day I can have the courage you have, to leave my marriage. My husband is an alcoholic, but I just keep putting up with it. I love your channel and really look up to you. Ryan has got to be crazy to ever hurt or under appreciate such an amazing woman. I used to think he was funny till maybe a year ago I thought he got a little too extra/ cheesy and maybe a little too into himself.
My x husband was a narcassist and let me tell you that scarred me in ways so badly I never want to date again. I tell people I am a nun now 😂 I hope you enjoy your time to yourself and hope this will bring you peace and everything you need ❤
Have the direct conversation to avoid lawyers as they are the only ones to make money.   You are both mature adults that should  both sit and decide the final outcome. Save the legal fees and talk to each other.  The kids are the priority, adults can start over.
Take care. When you're separating it would be good if he leaves. I don't wanto to sound harsh, but being roommates with the ex is not a good idea. Take care.
Divorce sucks! It does get better, it just takes time. We’ve got you girl!
This is so sad I can’t even watch it. I’ve been married for 5 years and I know you never wished or hoped for this outcome. It makes me afraid. May God bless all the married couples here that they will have wisdom and grace to deal with difficult times
❤️❤️❤️ praying for you and the kids. Can't wait to see you on the other side of this.
Youth really is wasted on the young…if we only knew then what we know now😩🥰
Oh no, I am so sorry to hear about you and Ryan . I just loved your videos together. You guys were so funny! I wish you and your family all the best 🤗
I'm not a YouTuber or anything yet but if you need a long list of single mom life hacks, I have it!
I admire and respect you so much for turning your tragedy into a learning experience to share with others who may be going through the same thing.  Divorce is almost exactly like having a death in the family.  The deep grief and agony of one is no different from the other.  However, what you are going through and deciding to share with your followers will not only help you heal quicker but will be a huge help of healing and understanding for other grieving couples having to go through this too common traumatic experience in life.  Thank you for staying open with us!  Thank you for trusting your followers who truly care about you and your family.  Brittany, you are not just some average spokesperson trying to sell stuff and gain subscribers like you see all over YouTube on other channels.  You are a woman who truly cares about other people and wants to help others have a better life just as much as you're trying to have in your own life.  It's this "thing" I saw in you from the very beginning that made me subscribe to you and set you apart from all the others and is why I have never left you and keeps you in the top 3 of my all-time favorite channels that I look forward to and never miss each and every week.  Thank you, sweet lady.  Thank you... and hang in there.  I know you're hurting like there's a knife in your heart that you can't pull out.  I've been there and done that and when you have kids it's a hell on earth I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.  But there is an end to this grief.  The knife will come out.  You will get to the end of this dark tunnel, and you will be stronger and wiser because of it.  You will heal, I promise you that.  You really will.  And even your scars will start to fade and slowly disappear as well.  I promise you that.  Time is your best friend.  And being your own best friend and leaning on your friends and family will help you all along the way.  Keep going, my tender-hearted friend and never stop looking out for the best way to look at every moment, finding the good in each and every moment of each and every day.  Hold your children close and pour out your love to them.  They will not understand but they will soak up your love and that's all they really need.  Hold them close and you'll all get through this to the light at the end of that tunnel that shows clearly there is still a bright future ahead for not only you and your children, but for Ryan as well.
I married a narcissist, and after 26 years, I'm done, done, done.
I wasn't married to my daughters father and we split up when she was 6 months old. I've chosen to stay single as well. My daughter is now 13 and I'm the happiest I've ever been. Her dad is now married and has three boys. I like his wife and his boys are so sweet. I'm happy, he's happy. It's a huge difference from when we were together!
Wow 🤩 Britney you are amazing and always will be. Your kids have the best Mommy and you will be happy as  you deserve to be!! We love you!
I have been single for 5 years and It's the happiest ever been
I separated from my son’s dad when he was 11 months and he’s about to be 7. I also came out of that relationship very scarred and knew that dating wasn’t in the cards for me. I have been single ever since and don’t feel like I’m missing out. I have no desire to be in a relationship or put my son through that. I completely understand where you’re coming from by and agree that people think it’s crazy but it should be normalized. I see you. You’re an amazing mom and once this is done you’re going to have more peace. Hugs! 🤗
Nothing wrong with choosing to be single.  I've done that after my relationship ended and I couldn't be happier.
So basically he’s a physically, mentally and emotionally abusive narcissist.
Stay strong !!! I’m sending you positive vibes 😘😘
When overwhelmed by an emotional moment, I give myself permission to cry all the way home, or when I get home, but pray to get through the task at hand. I understand. 💖
How can we best support you right now? What gives you the best return? Views, purchasing through links? What can we do?
You're so tough and sweet and amazing and I'm just so happy that you're in such high spirits thank you for always being such a good big sister to me❤😊
I’ve been single for 8 years, went back to school and started my own business. I happy focusing on my kids.
Amen to red flag lesson 1. Yes yes yes. Newly single mom myself. I hear you and i feel you. Sending you peace and abundance
When my ex chatted on me, I was telling the same, but then I met my current husband, 6 years after divorce, and we are the happiest .I wish you all the best
God bless you and your children. ❤️🙌
You did not use the word..'narcissist' ...but the red flag warnings you mention are the same.  If so, be careful, document everything and make sure you have an attorney that understands how to work with one.
So sorry you are going through this. I wish a peaceful divorce and praying that you guys can keep it amblicable  for the babies. And if you can’t do what you Got to do girlie!!
❣️
You’ll get through this, Brittany! I know it seems horrible now, but eventually, you’ll be out on the other side and it’ll all have been worth it ❤
You are in my prayers brittany,  there's no pain like what your going through ❤❤❤ you will come out the other end better off xoxo
One day at a time Brittany. You’re doing great!
! Best
❤ sending you love sis. It is powerful and brave to acknowledge where you are hurt and what you need. Running into trying to find a new man is often the very opposite of evolution. From one single mama to another, I appreciate your content - that you have chosen to provide tips to others on how to make their lives just a little easier and more comfortable in the world we live in, is really beautiful. It is all the mundane moments of life that make a life!
Years ago, my therapist told me you need at least 1 month for every year together for recovery.
Brittany, while my heart hurt for you a little bit when you said that you have been scarred, you are correct that there’s so much to life and you have a lot of living left to do with your children and your family and your friends. Wishing you nothing but the best for the future.
Brittany you look great!  We love and support you so much.  You are amazing!  You’re smart, savvy and you love your family.  I do buy through your links and will continue to do so.  Everything will be okay.  Your “squad”. Is here for you!! 😢😊😊
Oh Brittany the US Law allowing the other party to remain living there until the divorce proceedings are completed seems like a cruel and unnecessary punishment!  In Australia you can’t even apply for a divorce until you have spent 12 months living completely apart. I don’t think I would be here today if we had been in your situation.  All of my love and prayers go out to you and your children during this incredibly difficult time.  You are a very strong, creative and entrepreneurial woman so I know that you will get through this phase/chapter but I also know that in times like this, reading and knowing you have all of this love and support from your subscribers/supporters/girlfriends behind you will help boost and buoy you along in the harder darker times. The inevitable ebbs and flows so to speak. And we will not expect you to put on your happy face all the time. We just want you to do what it is that you feel you need to do and we will be here for you. ❤❤❤
We all got your back and are cheering for you!! ❤❤❤
I pray that you can use this horriable experience to give your troubles to the Lord ❤ God bless I am so sorry 😢for what you went through I don’t even know but I wish it was different your an amazing person ❤
Do what's best for you ❤ Praying for ya'll. ❤
You are such a beautiful person inside and out Brittany. I am divorced and I totally understand your feelings about dating and being single with children, I've been there. 🥰
Sending u love from Singapore...you've got this...one baby step at a time! x
Brittany you are the best. You are always keeping it real sister. You will always succeed and your support squad has got your back
Britney, My ex and I separated when my son was six weeks old.  I stayed single and did not date until he was ten years old.  At that point, he was the one that said to me about doing something for myself. And maybe going out on a date.  I tried it for a few years.  Realized I was not very interested in having to basically, train someone. I decided to live the single life after that.  I was 25 when I had my son. And this year I'm about to be 63.  I find my joy in being around my son, who is now married.  I'm fortunate to have a wonderful relationship with my daughter in love and and I have three beautiful grandchildren, ages eleven years, Sixteen years, And eighteen years.  I have lots of family and friends and people. I know who love me and I do not feel lonely and am enjoying being alone.  My point to this is that you have to be true to yourself. And you do not have to have another person in your life to complete you.  Just know that we are here to support you in any way that we can.  You will figure out what your new normal is and you will be great at it. I just know it. Take care, Brittany!
I support your decision not to date. Too many people jump into dating again. I loved my single life alone with my kids! I waited to date till the youngest turned 18. I loved every minute of it, my focus and attention was not split. I never felt alone. I had plenty to do as a single mom and I expanded on my hobbies and friends. A total win-win! Figure out your own path and do what makes sense for you.
I'm at a time in my life where seeing you get through this is extremely encouraging. It's a tough road, but to have the chance to focus on what you need to, and purge the things that drain you is such a blessing in the end. Sending you peace, love, and strength! 💖
God bless you during this tough season 🙏🏾
Support Squad, love.
Best and most difficult truth to accept 'when someone shows you who they really are, believe them" ........ yes !!
I feel like staying single is a wonderful decision. My mother left my father when I was 8 and went on to have several boyfriends over the course of 12 years before getting married. I love my mother and I forgive her, but the chaos and damage done to our family because of the boyfriends has had lasting effects. Especially for me. Growing up with divorced parents I always wished my mother had remained single at least until I was out of the house. My dad at least had the courtesy of remaining single until I went to college, or at least keeping it private. It provided invaluable stability that I am forever grateful for. You are a good mom 💜
You really will enjoy time to yourself. It would be less headaches.
Brittany-  You are amazing…& yessss- let us (“your support squad”!!❤) and your friends and family really be there for you! You are so on-point with your tips/lessons- people do show us who they are, & even though it’s hard, we need to believe & accept it. Also- kids are very resilient and they will follow your lead so keep up the good self-care!! 💝
Is it true that people that already have kids are the ones not looking to date again? I was in a abusive marriage, no kids and I would love to get married again.
Good job because nowadays it’s not safe to date it’s really not. I haven’t done it myself. It’s just me and my children I do not need more.
I’m an Independent Latino. 2:04 I truly understand beautiful lady. 15 years of marriage, now divorced. I have been single 6 years working on myself, and focusing on my 8 year old kid. I’m feeling great maybe ready to date. But get turned off hearing married couples problems - makes my stomach queasy. Sad part is when my aunts advice me to date while  I’m still look pretty.😢
God bless you and your family.
It’s ok to focus on you and your kids and not rush into dating. Take your time. Since you both are still in house together you really never know what may happen. You might reconcile; who knows. Pray.
Keeping you in my prayers Brittany 🙏🏻 My parents divorced when I was 5. My Mom chose to never date or remarry again, she has never regretted that decision. Honestly I feel the same way 💗 ((Hugs))
💔❤️‍🩹even though you don’t get into it I’m praying for you and the babies, that God gives you peace. 🥰
I’ve been single for 10+ years and I honestly have no desire to date…I don’t know ONE happy couple!  I prefer a stress free life alone 💅🏻
Yes!  Being single is a perfectly legitimate choice!  I am leading a lovely single life.  You're going through the really hard part right now.  It's kind of like a roller coaster, isn't it?  We're here for you.
Normalize being single!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉 thank you!! I hope for the best for you!😊
I just bought a set of your brand sheets on Amazon!! There is a $25 coupon that I was able to use. For anyone thinking of the best way to help Brittany, nows the time 😂
The legal bills alone will make you never want to touch another man again. Jk but I just said that because it seems like you like humor to cope a little.   I went that route initially of potentially trying to hire a big bulldog attorney, but i was never married and we had no assets in common so the big attorney was nice enough to tell me that i didn't need his services and i went with a state service here in Arizona for child support, custody and parenting time.
OMG I could never live together until finalization.
My ex initiated the divorce. Been divorced since 2020 and I'm still not dating. Take your time to heal. There is no rush. Put yourself first. ❤ It's so easy to always be in mommy mode.
To make the divorce cheaper, you can ask for mediation to be arranged at court. It can all be done on the one day. No ongoing back and forth and ongoing costs. I can relate. My divorce cost a lot before I knew about mediation. But all these years later I say now, it was the best money I could have ever spent. No matter the cost, I have freedom, happiness and self respect. And you  will look back in the future and say, it was worth every cent to be free ❤ And remember…. all life lessons come from pain. And for the kids, it’s better to come from two happy homes than one broken one 💗
im dating now, but if we break up im quite certain i dont want to date anymore. i was very happy single and don't really have a need for a relationship.
Did I miss something? Why is she leaving him?
❤ Wish you all the best
It's been a while since I watched this channel but it is now blowing up on my feed.  I assume it is getting a lot of traction on Youtube due to the divorce.  I have to say that I always felt that guy was sketchy. I remember her saying in a few videos (this was a long time ago) that he was getting all this attention from other women.  She blew it off like it was all about these other women being inappropriate but I was like ...hmmm... nope... something is up here.  It seemed to me that he made her feel insecure about other women.  She is lovely and deserves better than that.
Oh I felt for you so deeply when you shared that you’re still in the same house.  I went through that for the first several months of my divorce and it was sooooo hard.  I’m sure you’re doing everything possible to maintain boundaries and protect your energy and peace.  I hope this living situation is very short-lived.
Very important to be ok to be single. It's different for everyone.  It's hard with children. Ugh when you try so hard to keep your family together and then when it doesn't work out.   Dealing with dating when older your dealing with your baggage and children and then his.   ???
❤ You are amazing Brittany!  We love you!  You are smart beautiful and sweet!  Keep being you!
oh Brittany, we are all so sorry….the struggle is real…hang in there 🙏🏼
As someone who went through a bad relationship, I thought I hid it from my kids. They did tell me when they grew up that I wasn’t as great as I thought I was. Your kids will be able to feel the tension and notice more than you think. Best of luck to you.
Blessings and prayers going  toyou and you boys way. I agree! I wouldn’t date or get married again either. Sometimes in marriages you learn you’re not a bad person and it’s not being selfish but you know you can do it. With Gods help and make a good life. Take care of yourself.
I use to be friends with someone who is a divorce lawyer, unfortunately she is doing very very well. I hope you guys can do a lot of stuff without the use of lawyers. 😊
were here for you @vasseurbeuty. ❤️ We will support in anyway we can... from liking, sharing your videos... you can do this.. know that you have other people support as well and ur not alone.. ❤️
Hugs for you. I'm so sorry you are going through this. Praying for you.
I was with you, till you said you filed for divorce and you are nor planning on dating. If it was his move, if there was something else in your life, I would have got it. Sorry girl but your decision is wrong. There is NO MAN faithful to his wife. So, you put your children into these stress cause now you are blind from your ego. I have talked to couple who stayed all their life together, and all have said the same thing,  you have to go through it together, it doesnt happen in one day or months, but it will happen, people changes, I change too, and Ryan will change on his way, but you want everything to happen now. You chose the easy way, you run away from them problem but you are creating even bigger. What would be next, you open the door for another wife and children to come. How are the children gonna respond and feel about it, I was once one of those children, and I can tell you it hurts. Noone is perfect, but Ryan loves his children and he supported you with passion, and that's something we all have seen. I would advice you not to break your marriage, no matter what have happened, you will and he will regret it.
You have such a healthy attitude!  A breath of fresh air.❤
Sorry you a going through this difficult time. You are a brilliant young woman. You will get through this. One day at a time.
If someone tells you that they aren’t good enough for you… believe them.
I’ve been divorced for 10 years. When we split ways, I said I didn’t want to date. Everyone told me I would change my mind and for a bit I tried dating. But after a short while I realized dating/relationships is really not what I want. That still may change in the future but as of now, I’m good. Don’t let people tell you what you want (not that  it think you were listening to them anyway).
Love you Brittany! ❤
I got divorced last year and had a very similar situation, two kids and all. I also didn't plan on dating for a looong time, or ever marrying again. Well, I met my current boyfriend 10 days after my ex moved out and for a while we were just best friends but it turned into more and now I'm even considering marriage again. My way of thinking has changed 180 degrees on so many topics over the past year, it's crazy 😂
It sounds like he’s a narcissist!
So when the divorce is final, Ryan who will be moving out from the house?
❤❤❤
I hope you can take the time to read this as it may help you. In 1990 when I got home from 6 weeks in the hospital trying not to have my premature baby (she ended up only being 8 weeks early and perfect)I discovered my now ex-husband was having an affair and would not stop. When I left with my newborn and 2 year old, I had no job, home, or hope. I never thought I would ever want a relationship again until the miracle happened. (A story for another time) 5 1/2 months later I married my soulmate and it has now been 32 years. We have raised 5 children, 2 of which we have lost, but our Brady Bunch family is strong.  They key for us and our kids was to NEVER talk negatively about our children's other parents where the kids could possibly hear. They will figure it out on their own eventually without our input. My ex attended birthday parties and parent teacher conferences with me etc. because we had a common goal - our children's happiness. It was not easy but it was sooo worth it in the end. I now live across the country from one of my sons and his father, and I was back in town for a few days visiting visiting family with my daughter (the premier) when the kids asked if we could go out to dinner with their dad. They had never really seen us together where we could reminisce and they could ask questions.   We have now done it a few times and the kids are happily in their 30's and very thankful that they were never put in the middle. They learned from a young age that we can all put our personal feelings aside for the better good. You and your little family can make it through just fine when you all just try to do the right thing... even when the ex acts like an  a$$. You've got this! You are a strong, capable woman and I promise you will find your joy again!
We support you brittany
You deserve the best ❤
Girl…. Been there. All my love and support to you.  I did this and I didn’t have money. So believe it or not, it can be worse. You’re fortunate and talented and you’ll recover your losses.
Your husband is in so many of your videos, is he still going to be part of your channel?
💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
💞💞💞💞💞 you cheered me up today 💞💞💞
Yes normalize being single! I am happy being single also have a very tight knit family and having to split things like holidays or planning around another family sounds stressful. Some may say selfish but I don't care.
Thankyou for this video ❤ Love and strength to you.
I separated from my husband when my kids were 4 and 8. I did date but only two men thatI dated long term met my kids. I remarried when I was 50 and my youngest was 20. I didn’t think I could let someone come in and act like they had authority over my kids so I waited. Best decision I ever made. I am married to a wonderful man and he is truly more than I ever prayed for or could have imagined. Hang in there and may God bless you and the kids. ❤
Sending tons of love and good vibes ❤❤❤
What's a forensic accountant?
Sis, as a divorce coach, please consider withholding information about your divorce so it’s not weaponized against you. I see you trying not to be specific, but a skillful attorney can use this against you.
I didn’t date for six year after the divorce was final and we were separated for years before that and I wasn’t dating then either. It’s ok. I’ve been remarried for 27 years now and it was the right thing for me. Good luck and take care of yourself.  Remember what they tell you on the plane, put your oxygen mask on first so you can help others.
I have been single now since 204 and I am great with the single life.
Does anyone know where the makeup brushes are from?
My prayers are with you in this difficult times. Thank you so much for your honesty!
💯 when someone shows you who they are believe them.
Do you die your own hair? I love the color! I’m blonde and I had an appt that was too toned and went back and now it’s brassy and I am so disappointed! I wish I could do my own hair!
What  happened? I just now am hearing this ☹️
Love you and the kiddos sweet mama. Sending strength and positivity 🍀
❤❤❤ I am currently going through a divorce after 20 years of marriage. It does get better it does get easier. I am a mother of four I feel you girl❤️❤️❤️
You matter and I hear you!
He needs to get out
Brittany you are handling this so well so proud of you and thank you for all the tips ... I also have gone through divorce its not easy but you are doing all the right things like therapy your mental health first and not worrying about but putting yourself and beautiful kids first... Looking forward to seeing your new journey God bless you and glad you have family and support there for you sending hugs 🤗
So many women are choosing not to re-partner again…because they have raised their standards and men aren’t willing to work at being anything other than mediocre. But women are no longer willing to settle. Women are living with other women platonically to share expenses and household chores and give each other support.
Sending u luv...prayers n positive energy. Surrender ur situation to the supernatural God he will take charge over ur life n will giv u a new begining. He will be there 4u n take u to heights tht u have never thought about. I wish u abundance in every areas of ur life.
Hang in there sweetie, it’s all going to be okay.  And you are doing much better than you probably think you are, you’ve got this and we’re all behind you ❤❤❤
prayers you reconcile
What happened? Infidelity?
I’m almost 28-years-old and dating is so hard. I met a guy IRL and we hit it off. He met my friends, we hung out a couple times a week to late morning , he even kissed me and didn’t wanna leave my side -to turn around and tell me he only saw me as a friend. He is 29-years-old!! Does it get any better ??
Please be careful what you say in each video, you’re probably already consulting with your lawyer before you post I just would hate to see anything used against you.  You have a loyal group of followers here that want to see you thrive! Post as many videos as you can. I hope you can make lots of money to support yourself and your kids through this time. You’ve got this girl
Totally understand the being single and not wanting a relationship. My dad passed away when I was 3 and my mom never remarried again or dated really. She focused all her energy on my siblings and I being the youngest. You do what’s best for yourself and your kids. Sending you lots of love!! ❤
I have been through a divorce it’s really hard, I have been with my 2nd husband for 20 years if anything ever happens to us I too would remain single. I agree why is there so much pressure to be in a relationship! You will get through it. Xx
What???? When???? How????? #shocked #OutOfTheLoop
is it sad that i knew about the 6mos rule from watching soap operas?  lol
Forensic accountant? Sorry, but what is that? Best of luck, we are behind you
Wow, living together while separated has got to be tough and supremely awkward. Hang in there Brittany. You're doing all the right things so well done. Thanks for sharing. Big hugs, xx
I wish you get thru the mental and emotional stress, I  truly wish the best for you and your kids take care brittany❤
I'm so sorry this is happening to you, but also so proud of you for making that difficult decision. So many people "stick it out" and find themselves bitter, wondering "what if?", or just being less themselves years down the line. Partnerships don't have to last forever, and that's ok. You're amazing and you will make it through this.
God bless you & your family Brittany!  I divorced at age 40 with two kids. I had married my high school boyfriend & was very depressed that it didn't work out and did not even date although he had several girlfriends & he moved on like I never mattered. Neither of us ever married again & he passed away in 2010. I spent many years sad, lonely, angry & depressed. Both of my sisters & my mom always had a boyfriend or a husband & they still do. I'm 65 years old now & I regret that decision, but I never had the self esteem to even try to move on. I've tried therapy, but it did not work for me. Other than my kids, I felt like my life was over when my marriage was over. Both of my kids are grown & have their own lives now. I wasted many years of my life & I don't recommend spending the rest of your life never even dating & trying to move on. Just like the saying goes "if Moma ain't happy, ain't nobody happy!" Neither of my kids have ever married & I think our divorce affected them both more than they let on. You are still young & beautiful Brittany. Don't give up on love. It took me until my 60's to get to the point that I just don't care anymore, but I gained a lot of weight & now on 2 blood pressure meds, 3 cholesterol meds, & 2 diabetes meds daily & just turned into a depressed, bitter loner & I don't recommend it. Take your life back girl while you are still young! Praying for you!
Brittany, take a day at a time, you’ll find it easier to deal with the roller coaster of emotions that divorce brings! Sending you LOVE. ❤️❤️❤️
I know this is harder than we can imagine. You will have so much insight to share with your kiddos about relationships that will help them immensely! And good for you for focusing on yourself and your children. Even if one day you find someone worthy of a relationship with you it won’t be because you were desperately seeking a partner! Sending ❤ & good vibes.
Just remember.  Everyone who has gone through a divorce has an opinion.  But no divorce is the same. I had so many people give their opinions, my head was spinning.
Yes!! We need to normalize (especially for women) not needing to be in a relationship or to have kids. If men chose it, nobody bats an eye but if women do “there’s something wrong with them” 🙄
I left the bum in my 20's with my baby decided not to marry again. No regrets. I dated 20 yrs after decided not to marry again. Left him as well we did not live in the same house. I respected my son. I'm 67 love my life always
My parents divorced when I was young. They were separated for a few years before the divorce. So I grew up with my mom and visiting my dad. He remarried right away. I actually half a step brother who I wonder could be a half brother. None of that came out until my dad passed away. And then I found out my stepmom’s true colors. She actually never liked any of us girls. They let my brother live with them when he got older. So he got more when she passed away, and the girls did not. I was so glad I cut ties with her after my dad passed. My mom didn’t remarry until she was in her 70’s. And she was very happy until my stepdad passed. I think I’ve learned to be a stronger independent person because of the divorce. I saw my mom raise seven kids by herself. And we all turned out okay. It does effect the kids. But Capri is around the age I was when my parents divorced. If you live with it, you get used to it. I don’t think any of us would have been happy if my parents would have stayed together. So I think it worked out better for all of us. I think divorce has some kind of stigma attached to it. But your kids will get used to it. And they may be stronger because of it. As long as your parents are happy makes a difference to your kids.
You're doing the right thing. You should stay single. Also God doesnt like it when u marry divorce and repeat.
I don’t blame you for not wanting to date anymore.If I ever get out of this I can’t see me ever trusting another man again. Take care 💐x
In Utah it’s 30 days. Part of the reason I moved here.🤷🏻‍♀️
The sooner you and Ryan can live separately, the sooner the true healing and adjusting to single life will begin. As a marriage and family counselor for more than 25 years I remind couples that it is better for children to come from a broken home than live in one.
I want to know is do you still love Ryan and is there any chance of working things out and maybe eventually getting back together down the line?
Brittany I’m reading more and more that eating meat is so good for eliminating depression and anxiety. Keto diets can turn things around .
Take as much time as you need!❤
You are beautiful, intelligent, family oriented and you have a good energy. Even if you choose to take time to heal and not date. Just be prepared mentally and emotionally that he jumps into another relationship very quick. This seems to be what many (not all) men do.
I got goosebumps, you literally said the same EXACT thing I said after my divorce "when someone shows you who they really are, believe them the first time". We are praying for you Brittany ❤ stay positive and focus on your sweet babies!!
Thank you for sharing your life experiences when you don’t have to. I don’t typically comment but I’d like to support your channel however I can. You got this Brit!
Thanks for this video Brittany. I’m glad you are trying to make this difficult time a learning experience. I know none of it is easy. I live by the Maya Angelou quote you mentioned. When someone shows you who they are believe them the first time. I always preach it to my daughters. It can apply to any relationship, man or woman. I have been using the breathing technique you talked about in your last video too. It works for me.  All My Best from a loyal member of your Support Squad!
“I’ve seen what I’ve needed to see” lol 😅
I am divorced, too, and seriously told people will never dated again, but things have changed. I found the most loving man who loves me and my 6 years old son. It's truly feels so good to be loved. We also have a good relationship with my ex as we are maintaining to be good parents for our son. I never thought i would get to this point. Brittany. I wish you the best. Life will lead you and gald to see you smile on this video ❤
Great video. Sorry you have to go through this. One thing I might add? I’ve been married for 42 years, and I have a husband who does blow up if we have an argument. However, it still works out ok if I wait for him to “ cool down”. He never likes to hear that he’s not right, but comes around the next day, once he calms  down, and realizes I was right. It’s how we’ve successfully navigated marriage . ( he doesn’t have any addictions, which helps). I’m always careful to calmly start the conversation with how good he is at such-and-such, and never criticize his “character”. ( another word for “hitting below the belt”)
Brittany I lost my mate of 22 years of a massive heart attack 7 months ago and I don't want to date either. Nothing romantic impressed me.
My son and x-d-i-l used an advocate to divorce. It's the only way they could afford a divorce. They also live in California.
Love your truthfulness. Keep strong and make sure to take care of yourself. Also PROTECT yourself.
Single for life. 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 Check.
As a single mom of two sons at age 24, I made a choice to focus on them and improving our life. Didn't date and was celibate for 15 years. Honestly, quite peaceful and no dating stress. Now I'm back in the dating pool and it's a hot mess out there!! You've got this, focus on you and your two cuties. 💜
Its surreal that we are talking about a divorce and how kids feel about it but then advertise hello fresh. Strange life we are leaving.  Do not take me wrong. I love your chanel, I learnt a lot from you. And I wish you will get out of this strong 🤞🏼
Is he still working for you?   I hope not!  You are going to get this through this-time and feel everything..
I am sorry for what u are going through.  I know you and your kids will be great.❤❤❤❤
Б Ээээээээ
Please tell your children before they go to school/activities/sports/birthday parties etc! Because you’re online someone is going to tell your son. And you both do not want that for him. San Diego is one of those “big city/small town” type of places. Don’t avoid it or put it iff. How the parents  approach the entire topic is crucial. Also, the kids know something is up
🤍 love and light…
When I got divorced I said the exact same thing about not dating. I was told I was “crazy,” “dramatic,” or would be sad without a man. I just rolled my eyes 🙄 & laughed at those comments because I knew better. I had 2 young daughters that I would never have exposed to other men. I just wanted to focus on my girls, career & making our new “normal” the best possible. Long story short I did NOT date for over 10 years! Not even once!! Didn’t miss it either which people find extremely hard to believe. Once my girls were older & doing their own thing I met someone strictly by chance. We were friends for a while before we ever went on our first date. That was 5 years ago & we just got our first house together last year. I have a lot of respect for the mom that wants to protect & focus on her kids after a split. Don’t let anyone doubt your decision either. ❤❤
Be kind to yourself.  Time to focus on yourself.  I would love to give you a big hug.  In times like this its a minute at a time then an hour, a day and eventually you don't look at time because your living again and living your life your way.  Sending you love and light ❤❤❤
God says you should marry.
Big hugs and prayers living without a man in my opinion is great not having to cater to anyone and have to get their opinion on anything. There are woman who feel they need a man only to hear them complain about it later on. You go girl and focus on your children and dream but more on yourself. Kids are resilient as long as they see YOU happy they will be fine.
❤ yes therapy is a wonderful thing, build those tools! Great advice! Support squad here 😊
The best thing I did after I got divorced was take time to figure out who I was.  I had many people who tried to get me to date again ( almost to the point of being obnoxious).  I learned that I did not need a man to complete me. I am strong and capable. Many years later I did fall in love and remarry. But by that time I had a good understanding of myself. I hope that this makes sense.
i feel like im reading this as “he cheated” , maby im wrong , but does anybody else get that vibe from the matter?
Brittany, thank you for knowing there would be some questions on the minds and hearts of your followers.  I have followed you for awhile and I just want to say that you seem to be such a very lovely person, which makes knowing about this very difficult struggle, so hard to hear.  Nice video  — sending hugs and prayers for strength and wisdom.   ❤️✝️
I don’t know if you are a Christian but I’m praying for you and the kids. #Blessings
Wow Brittany, you've gone through a lot with this divorce and It sounds like you are doing well despite your circumstances. It sounds like you have a great support system to fall on during this situation. I'm so glad that you are very classy about stating your side and there is no blaming going on with your conversation in this video. All I can say is to hold your head up high, you are strong and you will get through this mess. I have no doubts in my mind that you are both strong mentally and physically, so don't let anyone drag you down. I admire you for your courage to talk about your situation in this video. You  are a strong and confident mother that has what it takes to move on with her life. You go girl, Brittany rocks!
You are awesome! I love the way you’re able to open up without trashing your husband or giving tmi about what’s happening. You’re a great mom and it’s obvious you’re keeping your kids well-being front and center above all else
I went through a divorce in 2014. I am all for staying single.
I hope you can stay in your own home, that would be so much easier for you and the children.  I feel for you, you're such a nice person, I wish you and your family the best of luck through this difficult time.
Thank you again for sharing Brittany! You’ve been in my prayer list since your divorce blog. 🙏❤️
Haha haha Brittany, I said “I’m never getting married again”. Fast forward a few years, went to a spa overseas, ummmmm, got married 12m later.   You are fantastic, love your outlook, whatever happens you WILL have a lovely life ....
Praying for your family!
Hugs  to  you.
Yes! Let’s normalise being single!
Really appreciate you keeping on. So relatable. So relatable.
Brittany I just went through a divorce I live in I paid $10,000.  Yes I had plenty of panic attacks, my divorce took a year and he was living here sleeping in the guest room.  Be prepared you need all your paperwork.  Good Luck.
I give you credit and I sincerely hope that everything works out.  I know you will have lots of lows and highs.   I pray that you will come out whole and be able to survive and once again be happy.  Love you for sharing.
"Tolerate It" by Taylor Swift is on your summer playlist! Sending you hugs ❤
The kids haven’t noticed you guys aren’t being lovey or sleeping in the same room anymore? If that’s the case. I’m sorry this is happening but if it’s for the best for you guys then good for both of you. :)
Brittany. Im so sorry youre all going through this. I have neen through it (20 years ago)and have stayed single too. My kids are now grown-up and Im still on my own. Its a lot to go through. God has a plan. When one door closes, another opens. Stay true to yourself. I hope the time comes quickly that you and your husband can be civil and kind to eachother as I promise you, the children DO see and hear everything that goes on. ❤
Have a loved one going thru a divorce after 41 years of marriage. She in in her mid 70's. She was found at home in a" Living and Dying in Las Vegas " situation a couple of weeks ago. She is in Detox. So scared and sad for her.  I forward her all your videos.  My heart goes out to you. Thank you for your kind smart sharing.
What happened? Your such a beautiful soul!!! I am sorry for all the pain and hurt you are going through!
Brittany honey, it really sounds like you're getting good, solid advice.  It sounds like you have good friends in your corner - lean on them!  Continue to take care of yourself by facing each day one day at a time (or one hour at a time).  People will, as I'm sure you've already experienced, tell you that you will date again, there's someone out there for you, blah blah blah.  They mean well but stand your ground and don't even engage with them about it.  Focus on you and the kids, that's plenty - your plate is full.  Sending you my support - you really are a strong woman!  Prayers for you and the kids.  Hugs from just north of Palm Springs, MK 🤗❤️🌵❤️🤗
I’ll be supporting you more than ever!! Watching all of your videos and not skipping through the advertising. I have been following you for years now, you deserve the best and prettiest things in life. Be strong 💪
After my parents divorced my mom didn’t date until we were out of the home. I couldn’t imagine her bringing men home for us to meet. That level of sacrifice for her kids brings tears to my eyes and I’ll always be thankful for her focusing on us. Rooting for you so hard Brittany!!!
Bet he cheated!
So happy to hear the confidence in your voice when you talk about being single. I was single for 3 years after realizing I had no interest in being in a relationship again. Those 3 years were legitimately the best years of my adult life at the time. I was so reluctant to be partnered again, I decided the next one would have to basically be supernatural to convince me to give up my amazing single life 😆 You got this 😊
You're very inspirational! Always have been, but especially now. You got this. 💕
🙏💖
When I was unhappy in my marriage, I lost too much weight. Be sure to take care of yourself, have a cheeseburger now and then, and eat a pint of Ben & Jerry’s.
Youll be ok ❤
Thanks for sharing I will pray for you and family
I've been there too Brittany.  You'll get there!  It is a very emotional journey, but as a friend  told me....one day at a time.  Glad you have a good support system.
Remember  JESUS ...................put HIM first and HE will heal & protect you. HE alone will turn a negative into what HE desires BEST for you.
Single mom insinuates that you have no one telling you. I never understood women saying that when they have a man willing to help. I know the situation is shitty but it’s important for the kids to watch the language we use. I know we don’t know the whole situation, of course but when you get this stuff out to the world, I guess you’re bound to get opinions. Still of the channel and you though and I hope everything works out for the best.
Stay strong. 😊
Well said…why you accept you teach - hugs to you ❤
🌸💞Brittany, You Are A Rockstar💞🌸
You’ve got this girl. You and the kids will move on and be great. Stay strong ……break down when you need to. We’re all human and it wouldn’t be normal if you didn’t. We all luv ya  and stand beside you hun❣️
Been there young sis.  Hard times for sure.  Just know this will all just be bad memories soon.  Better times ahead I promise. ❤
You are so good to us out here , we love you and many of us will feel your pain  , taking time to answer questions at this difficult time can’t be easy  . Many are praying for you and trying to up lift you  . I know Cartervis young  but he is also very clever  and will work through all this and as long as you  speak kindly to or about each other  he will handle it much better . Children adapt to things easily if it becomes routine like Ivsee  daddy on  a, b c then mommy on defg  keep routines as they have always had they will handle it much better . Also the library will be helpful with books on this situation , if he has question answer as honestly as possible , he might no someone from school that has been through the same thing  . God bless you , stay strong and healthy remember you are loved and never alone  xx
I'm so proud of you. You are a very strong woman! Sending you positive vibes and keeping you in my prayers.
was he abusive?
Excellent information as always! I got married again after 20 years of marriage and 12 years apart because my kids were leaving the nest and I was afraid of being lonely (not of being alone); And boy, do I regret that. I think when you have a good support system and good friends to socialize with and YOU are happy, you don't NEED someone else. You may change your mind and find romance and that would be great but don't ever settle because it seems like the right thing to do...like I did. The cost is way too steep. And your flags-how I wish I had known that then; I am 66 so I feel like it doesn't matter that things aren't good, I am not happy, he isn't there for me emotionally. I don't tell him anything because he isn't supportive. Your comments about how someone acts when you argue and deal with life stressors were right on. He needs to be there when YOU need support, comfort, validation, or just to listen without judgment or criticism. Divorce is hard and I know your happy face doesn't mean you feel that way all of the time-you have an audience who watches you. But you are an awesome, strong, beautiful and caring woman.
When it comes to dating…who you have today is who you will have tomorrow.
The advice you would give your children is advice we should ALL listen to. At my age I believe lying is a deal-breaker. Someone lies to you and how in the hell are you ever supposed to believe them again. Even if it's something small can we ever trust that person to be honest? That can be a real mind game an end up making us look like a nag. I do believe with all people we allowed them to get away with lies all too often. We don't even ask ourselves if their stories make sense. If their stories don't make sense they're lying and that's that. The innocent white lie like your hair looks good is not what I'm talking about. A white lie is said to someone so you don't hurt their feelings not because you're covering yourself for some reason
My heart is with you and your kids ♥️ being in any sort of abusive relationship is horrible and it takes a great deal of strength to leave, i know from experience. Stay strong and lean on family & friends 💜
Every time you mention Hello Fresh I wish we had a similar service in my country! It looks perfect: fresh, homemade, healthy, and super quick! We do have restaurant deliveries, ready-made rations for the week delivered daily as sets of cooked meals that you only need to preheat, and we have many options for frozen homemade meals like dumplings, stuffed thin pancakes (nalystnyky), sweet cheese pancakes (syrnyky), all kinds of meatballs, but they must be fried or baked. And although delirious and often high in protein those are not the healthy everyday option
✨❤️Don’t let anyone downplay or belittle your decisions. All it does is make you feel awful about what you want to do with your life and your decisions. Things may change, they may not - but you don’t have to answer to anyone about plans for your future❤️✨
Men are just another task
I wish you would’ve touched on where Ryan sleeps, while still living in the house, because it’s clear he doesn’t share your bed anymore, but how did the kids know? Nothing is going on with daddy and mommy are not sleeping together anymore? I think children can sense when somethings wrong in a marriage and the parents just don’t want to  see that.
Don’t get in debt Britney
There are so many things wrong with people these days. Even though you are young you would do better to enjoy being single for as long as you can and if you find someone down the line pls make sure you see them through many situations, how they act and if they are narcissistic or not (something I didn’t know about and I am stuck because I can’t make a go of it without his income).  Don’t let your heart convince you to overlook red flags.  No matter how you may feel about him if there are any red flags showing up in your relationship, it needs to end before you marry, even if you don’t marry, they are gone. Pls keep this rule in the forefront of your mind always. Pls be sooo careful! Blessings to you and your family!
Hi, I think once a divorce includes a forensic accountant, it is going to get expensive and ugly. My advice would be to  bifurcate the custody, and just concentrate on the financial aspects of the divorce. Mentally, it’s very helpful If you don’t have to focus on two major emotional stressors when going through a divorce, at the same exact time. Also, regarding any conversations about the pending divorce, always have it in writing, and never believe anything either party says verbally. Britney, if I were you, I would be fighting for sole, legal, custody and joint physical custody.
I heard California keeps filing paperwork and dragging it out so that you have to pay more. So beware.
When I found out about the divorce and all the cheating, the first thing I said was: I will not get out of this situation fat like this 😂😂😂 I think the old me blamed myself for all that happened.  All that narcissistic gaslight emotional abuse thing is real. Two years later, I am happier, more mature, and understand that all that happened was necessary to become and be where I am right now. I am sure in a few years, everything will be a distant memory of bad times, and you will see that the kids will be ok, and your heart will be happy again; I see in your eyes the exact look I had; you are strong, you are worthy, you are valuable and you can go through this. Always sending love your way 😊
My exhusband and I lived together for a few years after we divorced. It truly helped the kids and us become friends again.
How a person responds when they're upset,sad,angry is such a eye opener. I always people that you need to see people in those seasons before deciding to go forward with marriage.
Relationship is another load of work, and, honestly, too often than not it’s just not worth the effort. So yes to being single! I admire how you can keep it cool and share your journey in a way that is still private and respectful to the kids. The internet definitely needs more people like you🙏
Absolutely a fantastic utube, ur journey…mentally awesome for you and the red flag, orange flag talk is for ALL OF US! ❤❤  I divorced 2 1/2 yrs ago at 74 yrs young.  I decided one night, Christian or not, I WAS NOT GOING TO FIGHT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE!  You spoke loud and clear, the TRUTH to relationship, all relationships. Boyfriend, girlfriend, ….in our/my case, husband and even a close girlfriend.  I made excuses for her 15 yrs and husband for 17 yrs!  Financially.  I hope you don’t get screwed over.  Yours is a lot higher difference from mine, but on a scale, both screw you over.  Hang n there.  They seem to never give up, never give in, and never are fair.  At least mine move out when Florida law, he didn’t have to.  Even if they move out they are still active, participating A-holes, continuing to break you down and cause you $$$.  THAT COULD NEVER HAPPEN TO YOU NOW.  WINNING!  You worked HARD FOR YOUR MONEY, …,WHILE THE JACK-A-S GOT TO QUIT HIS JOB AND LIVE SCOTT FREE ON YOUR DIME.  Forgiveness!? I never understood it/wasn’t interested, til…I put my arm’s straight out , like a cross, and screamed, name/he CAN NEVER, EVER REPAY me back, for what he did, or what he took from me, ETC.  As soon as I put my arms down, everything about him ROLLED right off of me. ❤ you.
Yes, take time to find yourself before jumping into taking care of someone else. God Bless
Just  imagine All your Followers giving you a Giant “HUG”. Your a Smart , beautiful inside and out , great Mom , daughter, friend, . Take this as a an opportunity to write your own path . Have Confidence in yourself to Move on to a better future. Your worried so much for Conner but he will b fine . Please take Care ….
You will b ok❤️
I was the same of NEVER being with anyone else after a divorce. But you will never know especially when the kids are grown up and it’s also ok if you never date but just be open to anything. Good luck with everything ❤
As a mother of older children, you can teach your kids, but you have no control over who they choose to date or marry.  All we can do is teach by example and hope for the best.
I am really loving the realness to these videos.
I’m very sorry you are going through this. I don’t know what led up to this but I’m not going to congratulate you like others here bc it’s not a celebration. It’s a tearing apart of a family and that is something that is always sad. Our society normalizes divorce, when it should be the absolute exception. I’m saying this as a child of divorced parents who also remarried others and divorced again several times. I do hope you and the kids can get back on your feet and that you and your ex can co-parent in a healthy way for your babies.
I am praying for you! I have been through a divorce and I know how extremely painful and difficult it is. And especially in your case where you are still living with the person you are separating from. I commend you!!!! You are a strong,kind,beautiful,intelligent, and all around wonderful person! I will be here to lift you up anytime you need 🙂your friend from the east coast ❤
Still living under the same roof is too hard!  You are tiptoeing on egg shells - even if you’re there at different times. Finances can be sorted out while you’re apart on the big ticket items like house, car, business etc. However, house contents, sentimental items & photos need to be thought about now.  Your children “already know”, they sense it. You’ll have tough moments, but you’ll get through. 🌻
Your're so amazing Brittany, you're doing all the right things, keep being strong and look after yourself as you deserve to be happy! and you look beautiful by the way!💖
I fully encourage women who want to be single to be single. I have many friends and a cousin who are happily single and fantastic women. After leaving a narcissist who was incredibly abusive to me I thought I would be single. I did try dating and that went badly. I was done with dating. Then this amazing man came into my life. I decided he was too great of a person to not have as a friend. Then we became inseparable. After we started dating he moved in one month later and proposed a month after that. A handful of people said it was way too soon. We got married 10 months after we started dating. This October will be our 7th wedding anniversary. We are still in our honeymoon phase. Haha.  One size fits all rules don't work for romantic relationships. People are very complex and everyone needs to decide what is right for them. What works for my husband and me could be an absolute disaster for another couple.  Everyone deserves to be happy and that looks different depending on who you are and even where you are in life.
Stay strong!
Best wishes to you and your family. You have a wonderful outlook on everything. Divorce is very difficult but you are a strong person and you will get through this. If you and your children need therapy then by all means please pursue it. It can only help in the long run especially for the children. Sending prayers and hugs your way 🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️❤️
Your orange red flags rules are so true. You are great.
Prayers for you and your family. ❤
❤
Oh Brittany, I don’t even know you But I’m So Proud of You the Way you’re handling this situation, I can’t imagine it being easy for you living in the same house yet living apart, ever since you put out your last video about getting a divorce, I’ve had so many of your older videos pop up in my newsfeed and when I watch them again, I can actually see the body language between the two of you, especially Ryan….Hang in there Sweet Girl and take comfort from your babies, You’re The Best Mom Ever and that’s what matters…🩷🩷💙🇦🇺
Queen! It’s because of your state/area why your lawyer expenses are so high! Try if possible to do as much through mediation to avoid paying so much. Praying for you, your strong I know you got this shit mama!
Yes!!  I hen someone shows you who they are believe them!
You're a co-parenting Mom, single person who has kids, Dad involved, single mom is there is no mom/dad in picture
If he begged you to get back together and promised to change and tried his best to win you back, how do you stay strong and not get back with them?
Stay strong❤
My mom divorced my dad when I was 4 and my brother was 7. Choosing to be happy was the best thing she did for us. Your kids will be ok and you all will move forward and be happier. I hope he moves out soon for you though cause I can’t imagine living together for very long once you’ve decided to be done DONE.
Words of wisdom!! ❤
So what I hear is that you are a victim of a narcissist abuser 😞 I’m sorry. You will heal and your boundaries are essential to move onward
I am happily single and have been since 2016 no more dating for me either! ❤🙏
❤❤
Wish I'd had that relationship advice drilled in to my head when I was younger! I saw flags but tolerated way too much
It’s too early for anyone to ask if you’ll date again. It’s all too fresh, no one should expect you to even think about that yet, and I don’t blame you for not feeling interested whatsoever.
Signing up for hello fresh now, literally just to support. I can't wait for this whole divorce process is over for you.
Brittney  I am so proud of you.  Drama free life is wonderful.   I am so glad that you are your own person.  You are a leader not a follower.  Be blessed!  🙏🏽
Brittany - another great video.  Your subs are your support crew!
CA is trying to encourage homicide!! with that law oh gosh so a spouse could do something unforgivable and STILL live with you? Ummmm….
Prayers for you & the kids Brittany 🙏🏻❤️
Wishing you the best! You can do this.❤
This totally bites and I'm so sorry.  However, as time goes on things will fall into place and you will settle in to your new normal. 🙏🏽👍🏽❤️
Ty so much for saying that we need to normalize being single I got divorced 4 yrs ago and still have no desire to be in a relationship or anything of the sort . I'm truly happy being alone ... people ask me all the time why I don't start looking lol nope I'm good ... I could definitely get one just don't want one .
Great advice❤ if I had applied this I would probably never ever have been in any relationship!  Most men aren’t worth the women they are with!  My mother taught me that and she is right
Sending lots of good vibes and prayers of strength and healing your way. ❤️
Tank you solo much to tell us what’s going on with all this we appréciate
My divorce occurred when I was 37, I chose to remain single and focus on my kids and myself.  My 3 kids are now adults and I have 2 wonderful granddaughters.  I don’t regret staying single, I’ve travelled extensively, built a thriving business, and have a peaceful home.  ❤
You know I don’t blame you on the dating situation  My husband passed away 8 1/2 years ago after 26 years of marriage. And right away I had friends and family tell me to start dating. My heart was not into it and it still the same today. I was a wife and a mother and everything else and did not know who I was alone. I really miss my husband but this 8 1/2 years has been a learning lesson. I had to figure out who I was and as of then and now I don’t plan on dating either. Society thinks be single is not right but I love it. And yes for 12 years I was a single parent of 2 it was not easy but I got thru it and God blessed me with my late husband.  Sending hugs. God Bless
Are you keeping the house then?
Hugs 🫂, you have the sweetest energy from the day I started watching your videos and I believe you when u said u don’t want to get into another relationship as u are scarred I went through that too. It takes time to heal and one doesn’t have to get back into relationships just because it’s expected or the norm. It’s nice to have but the recovery process does take time. Sending you lots of good energy and healing for u and ur kids, may the procedures go smoothly and abundance come your way so ur mental wellness is taken care of. cheering u on.
I wish you the best. Prayers for you and your children. 🙏🏻
Wow!!!!
Thanks for sticking with us! I’m so glad to hear from you so often. I for one, am here for you.
I’m single and I feel I’m done with relationships myself! But I am much older then u! Best of luck
I’m in ur situation, I have been married 23 years are kids are grown but my heart still aches 😭
You look beautiful ❤.  Keep those positive vibes and take care of yourself xo
Being “very single” for the past 25 years now. It was one of the best things I have done for myself. Continue to focus on yourself and the kids now.   As a retired paralegal, please keep a journal when you communicate with your ex just in case and don’t sign off on things without consulting your attorney. I wish you nothing but the best. Hang in there.
"Forensic Accountant".....uh oh....
Brittany I'm with you,if my partner left I'd never again get in to another relationship. Take things slow and everything happens for a reason my friend. 🌷🌷
A good book to read on relationships and just understanding the difference between men and women in general is called "Love and Respect" by Emerson Eggerichs. It is a Christian book, but it still applies and makes sense...and works.
I’m in the middle of divorce and I also want to be single forever now 😅 realistically I probably will eventually date again but not for a lonnnnggg time
You look soooo stress right now I Hope you know that you are not doing something wrong. It’ll be ok for you. You deserve to be happy, not guilty and you there is nothing to be ashame of.
What you allow will continue. I've decided to remain single, I don't look anymore. Im much older than you though! You're a beautiful person inside and out and deserve the best. Great that you are doing therapy. Love you 😘🤟
Hang in there, Brit. You are doing great, and God is with you.
You are doing everything right.  Stay strong, this time will pass.
I'm so sorry your are going through this. Stay strong. I went through a divorce a couple of years ago and now live alone. I COULDN’T BE HAPPIER!  Yet so many people are convinced I'm lonely and suffering without a man. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Dating is the bottom of the list of ways I want to spend my time. I struggle to understand the attitude that women need a man.  Those out hunting the next guy before the ink is dry on the divorce papers are short-changing themselves. Not taking the time to reflect and grow as an individual is a recipe for becoming a serial divorcee. It's 2023, not 1950. Strong, emotionally mature women don't need a partner to complete or provide for them.
❤🎉 you look great. Sending postive energy
I'm so sorry to hear about your divorce. And there is NOTHING wrong about not wanting to date after divorce. I'm happy to see that you are an independent woman and only prefer to focus on your kids. Wishing you the best.❤❤❤
Wishing you all the best ❤
You are brave. You are worthy. You are strong. You are enough.😊
Thanks for sharing!  Looking forward to seeing what’s in store for your next chapter!
I knew when you said you never farted in front of him, it was over.
I am wondering if he is batting for the other team?
Hi Brittany, I am glad you are so positive and you have stayed strong you are a breath of fresh air and a true inspiration to women please keep up the videos take care love Diane .
I grew up with two narcissistic parents who were not emotionally or physically there for me. My mom was constantly drilling in my head how men were untrusting, evil all like my dad. Honestly I swore up and down I was destined for failure with finding a partner. When I found my now husband of 3 years…. We’ve known each other for 10. He has NEVER once made me cry. Sure we’ve argued …but he’s always reminded me that he and I are on the same team and he’s validated my feelings. He has never made me feel unworthy and alone . He’s an angel literally put in my life to save me. He has always been the same from day one…..loving kind appreciative towards me and has never let one day go by when I don’t feel loved. There are GREAT men out there please never lose faith in love…your soulmate is still out there ❤
My grandmother raised me and after her divorce, she never dated. She didn’t want to be bothered she said lol. I didn’t blame her after what she had been through but wish a nice man would’ve come around. What ever you decide is your choice but I know you may find the right one one day when you’re ready 💕
Healing alone is noble, and necessary sometimes. You will gain your strength back my love ❤ Dont forget how worthy you are of companionship, you deserve someone who will hold you through this life (when the time is right) and love you the way you deserve i commend you for your honesty, we will all support you through this.
Praying for you!  I know you love to read.  Good Boundaries and Goodbyes by Lisa TerKeurst is really good and helpful!
My parents were married for 30 years and my dad had an affair and just filed for divorce and left. Yes it is majorly expensive in general and it took almost 2 years. He left when I was 7 months pregnant with my son and literally completely abandoned his family. It was hard to see my mom go through that level of betrayal but family and a good support system really helped push her though. They ended up going to court because my dad is a narcissist and would negotiate with her at all. But in the end she ended up in a good position and she is in the same boat as you…won’t ever date again. She says she will never answer to another man again. Wishing you all the best my dear!
Brittney, be careful about over sharing, it could easily be used against you.
You got this, Honey! We're here for you!
I’m so glad you said normalize being single. I’ve been a single mom for almost 7 years. People think I’m probably weird or don’t understand. I live with my sister & she’s definitely my rock. I’m not against dating after my divorce. Never have been against it but I knew I wanted to single for awhile. I’ve talked to guys & I just haven’t felt like I’ve wanted to continue it/move to a relationship. I’m focusing on being a mom & I really am content in that. I was pregnant when my husband left & my oldest was 2. They’re 9 & 6 now & their dad is going through a divorce with their step mom so I know it helps them knowing that their house with me “is stable.”
So proud of you Britney , I think it's healthy to just focus on you and kids and then in time maybe you will welcome a special person in your life . I feel like looking for another man right after your not healing and learning who you are alone . Your doing amazing under these extremely tough times
Once again the kids are forgotten just for your HAPPINESS😊
Forensic accountant says a lot. I used to wonder if he even had a job. You're going to do so well without him.
Stay Strong! You will get through this. You are going to be much happier.
Well said all true!!!!!
Are you worried at all about your husband watching and reading all of this? I've been divorced myself, and I know how traumatizing it can be. I hope things will settle down okay. I'm really sorry you're going through this. And no, never plan on people changing, not even for yourself. Change is so much harder than we think.  I'm sending you positive vibes!!❤
Oh noooooo he is still there! That sucks girl! But this will pass and there will be a happy ending
Love this and praying for you and your children.   Two pieces of advice I have is actions ALWAYS speak louder than words, and ALWAYS listen to your intuition. God gave it to us for a reason. If something doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.
Wow! This video did really surprise me! You are so honest and brave. Please know that your followers will always support you and you are not alone! Sending you lots of good wishes and ♥
I know this has to be so hard, but you really seem like you can do this ❤
Brittany, I feel u have really made great decisions on housing, mental positive healing, healthy eating, the children's hearts!!! U are an amazing woman, we are lucky to have u!!! Always watching u on Utube, we support u!!! 💞💞🙃💞💞
Jesus heals and sends you your Kingdom Spouse. 👑🕊  #Repentance #HolySpirit #Bible #JesusChrist
No it doesn’t Brittany. You need to take it easy and time to heal. When you are ready for whatever you will know it. So sorry you and Ryan are going through this but life changes us and sometimes we have to move in different directions. I am happy you are moving in positive directions
My heart goes out to you, Brittany. I felt some of your pain while watching this video. Hang in there, it does and will get better with time. ❤
Yes your absolutely right, when someone shows you who they are Believe them.
Normalize being single... thank you! I really hate it when people jump from one relationship to the next. Rebounding isn't a good recipe for a new relationship. Another YouTuber I watched had a new man before she even told viewers that she divorced her husband. It was jarring.
Single mom tip: zote soap is an excellent way to clean your makeup brushes. I cut slices off the bar and keep the rest of the slices in a jar for when I need them. It’s super cheap and has quite a few uses!  Also - things WILL get better! It will start to get even better once you are not sharing a home. Make a list of all the things you couldn’t do before because of your partner and seek to do them. It helped me find me again. You’ve got this.
One must heal before dating after a divorce. I have been divorced for seven years and am not dating. I don’t really see marriage in my future. Nothing wrong with that.
Know your worth!! You are amazing and will get through this and be happy. Really listen to all these wonderful things people are saying to you….
You go girl! You are doing great and are working in a very positive direction! I’ve been divorced for 13 yrs. I’m in such a better place! Like you it took some therapy, my besties, and my parents! I tried dating one person and I wasn’t to into him. After meeting my family and 20 dates he dumped me. He said that I have my sh** together and he did not! No loss!
What blush are you using? Gorg!
❤
You go girl! I am so impressed with your courage.
You are seriously amazing! IMHO, I feel you've put up with more than any woman should. You have NEVER trashed Ryan or remotely put him in a bad light at all, but the signs I saw FROM HIM were:  1) he works out WAY to much. Loudest sign of a narcissist. 2) he only wants to go to wineries, and alcohol played WAY too big a part in his life. (narcism and addict. Yes, time move on.) 3) he was entertaining inappropriate attention from another woman RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU! So what was happening when you weren't around?  Your fans love you and don't want you or your kids to suffer through this, but you deserve better.  And to reiterate, you have NEVER put Ryan in a bad light. These observations are from watching him.
Thank you for saying "normalize" chosing to be single! I have been single by choice for many years and love the independence. It is a drug!
I hope we can normalize being single is ok. I felt everything you said. Wisdom to pass on for those that can hear it. I'm sorry that you're hurting but I know you're strong and doing all the things to help yourself heal.
I thinks it’s good to take some time for yourself after all that’s said and done.  I wish you the best and I know you will get through this! ❤
I remember watching you since Vasseur Beauty. I never have liked him though... something was off putting. You are wise woman. Good luck😉🌷💐
You got this!!🩷 Also just want to mention that I appreciate the different settings in this video. It kept me focused and into the video the whole time!!
Babes…….that curling iron is literally doing nothing except damaging your hair so what’s even the point?
Dear Brittany, I cannot thank you enough for coming on to share the current truth of things.  Your honesty is going to be the source of your ultimate centeredness.  It is years later for me since my own tough sled knocking my head against an immovable relationship wall, and everything you express here is another step further towards healing and preserving a positive outlook.  For what it is worth, I have now been with my fiance for 25 years (was not inclined to marry) and life with him has been the affirming things in the main that I kept trying to battle for in vain in my prior ultimately impossible and dysfunctional relationship I needed to be free of.  Your future will shape its own self but how you are starting off, with so much self-care and care of the kids, is what will  bring you to the best path forward even if just an inch at a time at first.  So much love and admiration for you!  P.S.  I intended not to date after my tough breakup and did not waver from that.  When I met my now-fiance at least 2 years after that, it was without any intention of entering a relationship.  But I was healed enough by then not to refuse the slowly developing connection and it was many months after we met that we ultimately got together.  I was happy being on my own in the interim and regained my full self-esteem (and have kept it, and would have even without my current now-25-year relationship). ❤
I just celebrated 6 years of being a single Mom. I am the most happy I have ever been. I am not opposed to finding a partner but I am not looking for it. My son is 13 and I am very aware of how short his childhood years are in the span of our life. I dont want to miss out on our time, making memories, or having to juggle time with a new partner right now.
Dr. Laura would approve. Wait till the kids are 18 to get back in a relationship.
Serial cheater?
Exactly, happy parents equals happy kids...being married is difficult, being a single parent is difficult...it s not an easy journey when we decide to have kids! But once they are there you have to be the mature person because kids feel everything even if they can t express it at the time!  But in the future they will be grateful you considered their feelings throughout these difficult times. Accrimonious divorces are not good for anyone.  Therapy for everyone, even the kids is a very good option. It s better to deal with emotions now and take your time with big changes than to have to deal with it when the kids are teenagers.  Thank you for sharing with others your journey.
Can I ask why you divorced ? Is a shame that didn’t work out, but another shame is that you say you never date again, I mean never say never, you are a beautiful lady, you deserve to be loved and love someone. I want you to have a best life, that’s all 😊
My mom and dad divorced when I was 6 years old and I really think it was the best thing for her.  She was so much happier and productive.  So it made me happier too.  New friends were gained as well as a new career.  You’ve got this!!
What brushes are they
I'm sorry ...I know it's too personal...but y are they divorcing ?...
I’m praying for you. You will be good in God and his precious son Jesus ❤️🙏🏻
I’m also damaged, I’m also going to therapy. I’m definitely scarred as well. I totally get it.
You got this Brittany 👏🏻 Your decision not to date will allow you to have much more time and memories with your kids ❤
It's soo sad to say this but I had a strong hunch this would happen.
❤ we love you girl
U look great Brittany,  stay strong !!
We were screwed up emotionally in our childhood in relationship with those we loved the most. We heal in love relationships as well. Being single may be nice for a while, but you don't really evolve and learn practically, nor do you heal much if you don't experience reciprocal love.
Proud of you :) 💖
The things you said at the end of your video and the things I know now I really wish I knew before I even started dating when I was younger. It would have saved me SO much heartache and time wasted with people in general not just romantic partners.
Sending so much love your way rn. I've been watching since you only had like, 5 videos 😅 and as far as parasocial relationships go - you have been like the cool older cousin that has it all together. I've been looking up to you and learning from you ever since then. You have single-handedly taken me (and so many young women) into a new level of thriving in adulting. I'm taking the time to get sappy, thank you for everything, praying this goes as smoothly as possible 🙏
I use Hello Fresh and I like to watch videos of people making the same meal that I am making. I just find it fun and sometimes get tips along the way. like chopping hints or substitute ingredients etc. Do you plan on doing Hello Fresh videos?
I totally feel you on the not wanting to date anyone ever.  There’s something so nice about having true alone time at night with a nice cup of tea and a good book that is just so appealing.
Hi, you are amazing. So wise and very self aware. I’m really impressed with how you’re dealing with such a massive trauma in your life whilst keeping it together and making content to keep us informed of how it’s going. I know it’s a cliché but I think it’s also true that what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger and I’m betting that will happen. You are a survivor!
It is totally possible to live without romantic relationships. I am a 40 year old single woman and I'm doing fine, like really fine, people think that I pretend to be happy and play tough. I've been single for 13 years now, after a nasty breakup. People also tell me that I am traumatized and hurt, at first I was, but I decided to have this lifestyle and I feel fine. Not many people get it...
Ok, Blondie Blondie (LOL!) You're on my daily prayer list. You and your kids are going to be fine. God provides and protects. Today is not forever=tomorrow will come soon. Peace Out.
the highlight of video for me was that slice can go on the fridge i just learned that
You have children to raise.  Bringing a romantic entanglement into that can be complicated, why bother?  There is no rule, no law that says that you need a mate; it sounds like you have a good support group and that's all anyone truly needs.  Life is simpler without a partner, because quite often they aren't partners, they're just a big headache.  Who needs the drama and the constant fighting - no thank you.
Sending you and your kids lots of love and light!
Girl, I feel you on being in another relationship!
I have always thought your husband was a narcissist something I am so unfortunately familiar with on every level and from hearing your video today i'd bet a little money I'm right! You are doing the absolute best right thing and I promise you will survive and you will thrive! Probably better! I know it seems like a black cloud now but I promise you the sun will shine . I have been there done this in my life and I will not date again and I will not have another relationship again except with myself. Stay strong stay positive because I promise you it will get better
It's best for the kids to not be dating at all while they are still young, because you need to be focused on them at all times, and not a new man/men/dating stress.  There will be plenty of time for that when the kids are grown up.  You're doing so great at handling all this!  Prayers for you and your family!
Love you!!
I am single for years and have no desire to date.  I just can't imagine being with anyone and its been 17 years. My son was twelve when we split up and three of his grandparents passed and one uncle all within a six month period and he was just starting Jr highschool. It was really hard on him but we made it. A piece of advice I want to give you so you can avoid the same mistake I did. Please don't tell your kids that they are going to have a closer relationship with their dad because there will be less stress. My ex husband was very close with my son and I was so positive that he would continue with that relationship but not only did he walk out on me but my son too. It broke my heart when my son said, don't worry mom he doesn't love me either. I was 100 percent sure he would be close to my son and I never should have assumed that. You don't have to explain your husband's behavior. Let him have that talk wih them.
You can do this! ❤ We are here for you!🥰
Brittany... you are one of my favorite youtubers!!! OMG! And... now, I love you & admire you more!!! I went through a lot with my divorce... it's being 2 years now... and let me tell you... I feel better than ever! I am single now, and enjoying my time! And, honestly, not planning on dating... I've learned so much about myself, and it is the best thing that ever happened to me. I am here to support you!!! I wish you the best!
Sorry I had to stop and look for that dressing! I found it ! The red orange flag theory is an amazing advice ro kids, thanks for sharing and for keeping that crown up ! 🙌🏼
Whaaaaat! Omg I haven’t watched you in a few months..
single is best for me for many reasons and I feel beautiful and joyful.  prayers for peace and joy for Brittany.
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 I am so happy to see that you're doing better now and handling your own 👍🏾👍🏾 just keep hanging in there 😀
The ability to really resolve issues in a peaceful manner is huge. Unmarried couples should be able to do this before starting marriage. It shows mutual respect and true love. I raised my kids as a single mom. I bought a lot of prepared foods to simplify the daily routine as you are doing, too.
Sending you love ❤️
This was oddly peppy I felt uncomfortable watching but that being said I'm very happy for you and I hope you're not feeling pressured to be the stereotypical happy toxic positivity thing you see on social media
Thanks for being so open! Great advice you gave at the end there
Thank you for your answers. By the way, your arms look so fit and strong girl💪🤛
What happened? You two seemed so solid. I enjoy your videos! Many of your various tips have been very helpful!
Yes, being single can be normalized. I've always hated comments referring to my "better half" since we are each a whole person. My divorce wasn't terribly expensive but it was 23 years ago and not in California; also, it may have helped that I had an ex parte/ protection order on him since he had a history of domestic abuse.  While you gave some good advice about red and orange flags in relationships, Brittney, you never actually answered the question as to whether or not you saw any red flags with Ryan. A simple yes or no would suffice if you didn't want to be specific.
Support you 500%. Really appreciate how genuine and authentic you are.  This is so challenging and stressful, but I think you will make it into a meaningful and ultimately rewarding journey in the long run.
There really is so much more to life than romantic relationships. I wish more people spoke about it.
I respect you so much for how positively you show up and how hardworking you are. Keep strong Brittany, you are a real Lady with the capital L, so much respect xx
I think it's not a very good idea to tell all this private information on line. Just an advise from me...
Wishing the best for your future and your kids🙏😘
I so agree that we need to normalize staying single after divorce. I've been married for a long time, but if something ever happened to my marriage, I would  choose to stay single & focus on myself & my kids.
I’m just happy I won’t have to see her husband and his silly antics in her videos!
We teach people how to treat us. We can do that positively and negatively by allowing behaviour. Also it's never too late to walk away. If you wish you had... Do
Brittany, regarding your div. issue. I was recently div. in Texas (the law is similar to your state). If you are interested in some of my advice please send me a note on how to send you a PM. You may find some of them helpful in your case.
Praying for all of you during this difficult time. Good advice...I like to say don't paint red flags green. We do that because we try to understand and be loving, but at our own expense. ❤
Love you Brittany! I'll send you this on every couple of videos and through Instagram when I get a chance over the next few months.... Don't know if you'll ever see it, but if you do, I want you to know that you do inspire me more than you realize and I will always "follow" you! Thanks for all your advice through the years! Stay encouraged my YouTube friend! You're awesome and you're doing great!
Let’s keep BRITTANY paid ❤ we are all your friends and we love you!!!
What’s the name of the dressing? 😊
Yay for therapy! So happy you are taking care of your mental and physical health. Sending you massive support. xxx
Sending love and hugs❤🙏
You are so right. Every thing you said is accurate. I’ve been in 4 relationships with 4 narcissists.  There were lots of perfectly kind, loving and healthy men along the way that loved me.  But I couldn’t seem to choose them.   That doesn’t mean you’re destined for the same fate.  I pray for the perfect happily ever after for you and your family, no matter what it looks like.❤
I think it’s an excellent idea to NOT date (or at least not introduce to your kids) until they are clear, competent, and assertive talkers that are old enough for a jury to believe.
I'm proud to see a woman like you! Super smart & wise not to mention normalizing being single <3 I hope that your divorce goes smoothly & the stress is over quickly!
Brilliant Plan ! Continue Positivity ! I have lived many years solo and had a Dog Rescue for over 20 years filled with unconditional Love !  Keep appreciating Every single Day ad I can tell You do. Also continue eating Healthfully. I personally feel Proud of You. PS Being without Relationships is Not Doing Without. 😊
So proud of you! Put yourself and your kids first and you will always be happy ❤
I can't imagine having to live with an ex once you've decided it's over. You're so strong 💪 Sending lots of love ❤️
Hi Brittany. The best advice I have is to get a lawyer who is friends with the judge. My ex husband made a killing by doing exactly that. When you were talking about red flags my mind went directly to my ex. He’s a Narcissist and he was a complete nightmare  after I left him. Ugh! I sure hope you can stay in your house. Watch out for the greedy lawyers. Take good care of yourself.
You’re doing amazing
I'm dealing with a split as we speak. I had my son in 2017 and loved watching Carter's growth as I took first steps into motherhood.  I agree with believing people when they show you who they are. And they will. I was blinded by love and insecurities but this new chapter I am wiser. Thinking of you and sending you support at this challenging time.
Yes let’s normalize being single and loving yourself. ❤ You got this girl!
PLEASE READ THIS:   I have gone through a very difficult divorce.  Lawyers seemed to be dragging it out.  The point I want to make is this:  My sister was good friends with a veteran lawyer who’s specialty was commercial legal area however he knew of many family lawyers.  At my wits end with the divorce dragging on I booked an appointment with him and I left his office in shock.  He told me he knew of lawyers who would talk to each other meaning your lawyer and his lawyer!!   Meaning they worked together to gain more profit.   If there is any way you and your ex could agree on issues it would keep more money in your pocket than the lawyers.  I wish you strength and peace in this very difficult time but trust there will be better days.
GIRL!  I feel you 100%. I’ve been widowed for 2 1/2 years(not gonna lie kind of rocky). When ever people ask if I’m planning on dating, my answer is a strong NO. I get odd looks and more questions.   There’s nothing wrong with focusing on self and loved ones.  I think it’s been the absolute best for me.  Stay strong 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💜💜
I mean no disrespect to anyone that asked, but I feel you shouldn't ask a person that's newly separated and not even divorced yet if they plan on dating again. I think that anyone that was deeply hurt in a relationship gone bad will say no. I've been there and I said no for 3 years. But then I decided it was time to at least dip my toes in the water. I found a wonderful man (I had went to school with) that takes such good care of me. We're all different in the amount of time it takes to mend and get your head and your heart right again. I was 58 and married for 32 years. But you are young and have lots of time to take care of yourself and your precious babies before you decide you are ready to move on. I wish you peace and comfort Brittany above all ❤
Just want to say I believe in you! Your strength is so showing right now and it’s inspiring. Excited to see what comes next. Thanks for sharing your light with the world.
Never seen anyone this happy to monetise their “sad” situation! And using words like tea and juicy to describe things! Very strange!
I love that you’re keeping us in the loop when you don’t have to. I’m so proud of you and the way you’re holding your head up high.
Just be prepared if he staying in the house and y’all didn’t talk about that he’s going to get nasty with this divorce. Just because he can’t stay in the house normally to relieve tension in the house a decent man will go ahead and leave which probably means he doesn’t want to abandon the property and he’s going to get nasty now. If y’all already talked about this and said he would stay and he just doing what you two are doing and there’s no tension is a different story, but every time I’ve seen a guy do this they have pulled everything in the book and the woman wasn’t prepared and she lost everything.
So sorry you are going through this
I understand not dating. My late husband was verbally abusive. This left me gun shy about dating. Plus, I did try to meet someone online, and no one wanted me. I don't need the rejection after my husband's abuse. I quit for a while. I am working on my mental health.
Ugh this sounds so rough. Hope everything will get sorted soon and you’ll fully get to focus on your kids and your happiness!
Brittany, I just found your channel recently for cleaning and organizing ideas but I fell in love with your warm personality and overall vibe :) Everything you're doing to simplify and organize your life while processing what you're going through, your feelings and the insights you've learned show what an intuitive, sensitive, and strong woman (and mother) you are. I  think that while the early stages of all of this are undoubtedly painful and stressful, this is going to change you and your life in the best ways possible.
I'm soo sorry ur going thru this.!
Not dating is totally normal!!  My mom never dated after the divorce and never wanted to. This may be an extremely person option and I'm sure others would disagree, but I think I grew up with less trauma because my mom didn't date. I felt like I had her love and support fully and it wasn't divided with another man. Again, this I just my opinion and I understand that this may be kinda selfish to say.
If you are still living in the same house for up to 2 years , maybe you will ultimately reconcile during that time.
Good for you for choosing to heal first! That's admirable because sadly, some people are still damaged but have no SHAME of bringing people down with them instead of healing first by themselves so good for you! ❤
Good advice! Still in shock that this is happening! Glad you’re able to get therapy for yourself and for how to approach telling the kids. Don’t underestimate how your daughter takes this as she might surprise you. So glad you’re going to be able to stay in the house and not have that additional upheaval for you and the kids! Rooting for you! ♥️♥️♥️ so agree with you about not wanting a man in your life…I’ve seen all there is to see!…resonates. I think i’d be the same if I were to divorce to!
I went through my divorce when my girls were the same ages as your two little ones. A decade later I'm still living my 'happily ever after'... (as a single Mom) and loving it ❤
I was divorced 29 years ago, and at the time knew I would never get remarried. Although I did date several different men, ultimately, I decided to stop dating, get off the roller coaster, and my life has been calmer and more peaceful and I’m more content than ever! Don’t listen to anyone else, you do what’s best for you!
Love you Brittany, sending you many hugs. You’re doing great 💖
I hope this doesn't come across as negative or critical and I'm sure there is more to it than you want to - or should - go into, but I just wanted to say be really careful about keeping it from the kids - (or mainly Carter because I guess Capri is too young to notice things). I'm only leaving this comment because my parents did a similar thing and I knew that something was off for months but couldn't understand what - I was 7. Afterwards, I was angry with them for what I felt was them lying and I didn't trust them again (and would throw it back at them a lot!) for the rest of my childhood/teenage years. Obviously, you know them best and everybody is different and will react to things differently but I just wanted to mention it. I definitely believe that everything works out in the end though. xx 🤍
My husband and I are separated and are in the co-living stage as well. You are not alone beautiful. Thank you for being so open with your journey 🤍
You are a wonderful person, genuine and you inspired lots of people via your great videos and advice 😊
Can we be friends!? 😝I’m a newly single mom with 2 little kids and it’s been challenging but I have to tell you I haven’t been happier. I’m not interested at all to be in another relationship like you. Just want to focus on my kids and myself. I feel like all my energy for relationship/marriage was used up and it will be a loooong time to charge it back up😂Proud of you and cheering for you!❤
Yes just take the time for you before ever thinking about another relationship.
I am so glad you were able to refi at better terms.  My mortgage doubled and I had to pay him half on top of it, even though he was the one who (was lead to?) cheated with a minor.  I didn't cheat, I was open to reconciliation, but I had not known about his cheating or (supposedly) illegitimate kid(s).  Well, regarding your legal bill, just get all of your credit-requiring purchases now.  New car, home improvements, appliances.  I could have paid the bill with the cash-out refinance they made me do, but they never said anything when I mentioned it, I would not have any cash left over for me and my 2 kids.  Long story short, I could not pay that bill, the attorney sued me (even though he was a friend of my father's), it trashed my credit score.  So I couldn't buy a new car, I had to drive an old clunker, costing so many repairs, my washer and dryer fell apart, so his brother bought us new ones, and then the fridge went, then the oven.  He bought us a cheap little fridge, and I was able to purchase a new oven when my credit improved.
I think you seem better than you have in years!
Good luck sweetie you got this ❤❤❤
L💙VE The blue nails!!!
You got this Brittany, you are a strong beautiful women/mom. Continue being yourself and positive. Everything happens for a reason. You might not understand or know what’s the reason but you will eventually. You were blessed with two beautiful kids in this marriage so something great came out of it. ❤
Are you a capricorn?
brittany, you are loved.  i was shocked & horrified at some of the comments your christian followers left for you  the comments were cruel and so inappropriate. i have no words.  on behalf of the insensitive, please accept my apologies on their behalf  you are loved
Hi Brittany. I'm so sorry that you are going through this. I know you are going through a rough time right now, and I know it isn't easy, but you are doing an amazing job. Keep your positivity no matter what. It will get easier and you will be happier and healthier in the end. Sending you lots of hugs. ❤❤
Does anyone know if everyone has to live together until the divorce is final? Is this An agreed stipulation? Only curious because I don’t think I know of any couple who had to legally live together until the divorce was final. So interesting.  Wishing you well, Brittany!! Sending hugs ❤️ you got this, mama. You will heal and you will rise up again❤️
Dang. I’m sorry you’re going thru all this. I wish you all the best and my best wishes for the kids too. ❤
Are you a believer? I was where you were and God changed my life. I have never been happier and he gave me a new found way that I now view and have my relationship. Maybe just maybe he can heal you and your husband.
Literally, I have older cousins who have all said they never want to date again after their divorce. I also have an older sister , and my aunties have expressed the same sentiment. While a few of them have never remarried, all of them have dated after their divorce, with the majority finding new partners. Life takes crazy twists and turns sometimes, and the way you feel now is not necessarily how you'll feel in five years. Often, the right person comes into your life unexpectedly and makes you question everything, leading to significant change. So, while I understand where you're coming from and currently feel that you don't want to date, I believe it's probably best for the next few years. Nothing lasts forever, and given that you're an attractive, blonde-haired white girl, you'll likely find someone who will change your life and your perspective.
I have a question. Please correct me if I am wrong or misunderstood.  I remember you made a video about Ryan leaving his career and started working with you on your business. How does this affect things as far as you guys working together, having to pay him or is he going to be going back to his career?
I am so baffled that several of your viewers would actually ask if you’re going to be dating again!! I so appreciate your response to that question and yes as you should your mental health is important and your children. Definitely don’t need to be like some of these women that have multiple fathers for their children! You have standards and have respect for yourself and I definitely see that!!!
I agree, raise your kids first! I have been divorced for 9 years and have not dated at all and have no regrets.  I do want to say regarding being damaged- once sometime has passed my advice is to work on forgiveness. It is the only way to move on. I will be praying for you and your family.
*P.S. Indeed. Always trust your gut instinct/intuition (your "inner navigator"). 🚩 It's rarely wrong. Live and learn. This too shall pass... 🙌🏻*
I just wanted to comment because I have been divorced now for 4 1/2 yrs and can relate so much to what you are going through. My divorce took a year and yes. It was very expensive. I was the one to move out and my ex immediately went and saw an attorney and took all of our money from our joint checking/savings and put it all in his name. He then had his attorney draw up a divorce agreement (that he had our adult daughter type up - SO MUCH parental alienation). At the time she was in college and relied on him financially which was the only thing he could ever offer her. I was told then to just continue doing the next right thing and eventually my children would lean toward the healthier parent which was so true as now she and I have a much healthier relationship. Fortunately I have an aunt and uncle whom I am very close with. My uncle had been an attorney for decades practicing family law and owned his own law firm for decades before becoming a judge. Upon retiring he did mediations for several years. They insisted that I not sign anything and they actually found me an attorney, paid the $10,000 retainer fee and set up the appointment and all I had to do was go. The attorney, after looking the divorce agreement, told me I don’t care if you want to retain me or not but I’m strongly advising you not to sign this. My ex husband thought it was perfectly fine for me to move into a 2-bedroom apartment while he continued to reside in our 4,000 square foot lake front home. After I hired him and my ex learned this, it was war. We still have a very turbulent relationship which was extremely difficult as we share custody of our now 14 yr old son. My son was 9 years old at the time and a month after our divorce was finalized, my exes tinder girlfriend moved in and after only knowing my son for 3 months had the audacity to tell him that he could start calling her mom now. How confusing would that be for a 9 year old child???  Upon learning this, I calmly asked him what did did you say when she said that to you and his response was, I told her I already have a mom (great answer😁). The fact that had this girlfriend move in immediately after our divorce, in my opinion, was and is the most selfish thing he could have done to our children. I did date someone about 6 months after my divorce but it did not last long as this person was very controlling and I realized that I needed time to heal and obviously I wasn’t making healthy decisions regarding my choices and am still single to this day. I am at a point now where it would be nice to meet someone but I still don’t feel ready. Being single however has been the healthiest thing for me as I know I can stand on my own two feet and take care of myself and I don’t need a man. I have a confidence now that I have never had and I have something else which is invaluable. I have joy in my life. There is a big difference between happiness and joy. Happiness is temporary and is achieved through external things (for my ex husband, happiness is achieved through money and wealth). Joy is achieved from within and that for me is invaluable so I can totally relate to your feelings regarding dating. My number one priority is taking care of and being there for my children. There happiness and safety will always come before anything else. I have gone through a lot since my divorce. My mother was diagnosed with dementia right before the pandemic and, sadly she had declined very rapidly and I have had to move her 3 times in a 13 month period. I have a sister whom I no longer speak with because she has done absolutely nothing to help. Fortunately I am my my moms POA and the last move occurred a little over a year ago after she was attacked by a resident in the assisted living facility she was in. There was a lot of negligence on there part so I had to hire an attorney for that but I found her a home which is licensed as I assisted living but it is more of a home and she is loved and cared for and is only two miles from me so I see her often. I tried caring for her myself but she sundowns and I wouldn’t be able to work or ever leave the house and I would not be able to take care of my son. It has been a long road but I think you are doing all the right things and going to therapy and having a support system has been invaluable. Hang in there and keep your children as your number one priority and things will get better❤️❤️👍
Brittany I’m so sorry that you are going thru this! You are the only one who knows what’s best for you! My mother became a widow years ago at the age of 36 and was left with 6 kids and 1 on the way. She never remarried or went out with another man again. She always told me that her kids were her whole life and that no woman needs a man to make her happy. She was the most independent, confident, strongest and happy woman I ever meet! I always admired my mother because she was a very wise woman! Brittany live your life to the fullest because you don’t need a man to make you happy! You have the greatest gift God could have ever given you and that is your 2 beautiful children! They will forever be in your life!
Love you Brittany! You are a wonderful Mom! ❤
Yup! I’ve been done with romance for the past 20 years! Love it!
It's been 25 years since I have dated.  There is more to life than a relationship, which I am very happy I don't have to deal with.
I had a number of relationships that did not work well. I know I was also to blame. I gave up on relationships with guys years ago. Worked for me. Best wishes to all of your family as you move forward. Children can be very resilient, this is the adults' chance to show and model good communication and good adult lives with perhaps single mom role and  new adult 'friends' on every side. Done with love and respect things will be good.--hard, but good.
I think he cheated
You have my total admiration Brittany, wish I could be there to give you a BIG hug, and don’t be frightened to vent your feelings if you need to, maybe a punch bag in the gym or garage can work wonders xxx
As a therapist, I always tell my clients that if the parent(s) are OK, the kids will be OK. This is why it's so important to take care of yourself through this process. Happy parents = happy kids ♥
I love how much you normalize therapy. I genuinely believe so much in therapy.
Can i make a suggestion. Find a good therapist specialising in children now. And have them start to get to know the children before they learn anything. See if one will meet at a coffee house for a few informal sessions. Maybe then drop by to see her or him at work.... Ease them in. You can suddenly need to do something on your phone and they then play with the kids and talk about life. Make it normal now while theres nothing upsetting to talk about. Then trust will be established for when they need it. Nothing will be new and scarey when they may be dealing with thier feelings over the changes. The therapist will already ve someone they know trust and feel happy with x
Not dating is a great decision. Lots of women, particularly if they've suffered a betrayal, jump right back in to the dating pool, if for no other reason than their ego. But you've been in a situation from which you need to heal. Take that time and find out who Brittany is now at this point. What you want. What your goals are. What your dreams are. What kind of family life you see for you and Carter and Capri. You're going to grow so much in the next two years, you may not recognize yourself. But it's going to be great. Once he's out of the house and things are settled, the relief is going to be sublime.
Someone like you won't stay single for too long 😂  I guess the line of suitors and men that have been waiting in the friend zone for years are already brushing up on their table manners 😅
Praying for you and family 🙏
I think you have a great attitude ❤
Your videos are such an inspiration and a shining light on this platform!!! Sending you love and support to get through this tough time ❤❤❤
I Googled "Gaslighting" and hmmm . . .
I think you have the right mindset of not dating & focusing on yourself and your kids. I highly recommend Laura Doyle for any woman married or single. Her books, podcast an YouTube channel emphasize self care & gave me the tools to really improve my marriage and and self esteem.
A male relative came to visit last month & told us he & his wife are getting divorced  & both sre still in the house...what if the person doesn't want to leave after the divorce??
So sorry ❤
I can hear the pain in your voice. You have all my best wishes and prayers ❤you got this. Family is everything it is so good you have them close to you.
“Stress off your plate”😅😜that’s punny
My parents got a divorce they married young 23/24. They had considerable assets a few rentals 401ks. They spent so much in legal bills fighting over stuff, which was so stupid becuase they built it up together so it was a 50/50 split except for an inheritance my mom recenty received from my grandfather. Its unpleasant to be civil to an ex you despise but thinking about how much $ they wasted that could of gone in our college fund$ becuase they couldnt behave like reasonable adults sickens me. I felt like they felt winning was more important to them. Just some thoughts from a kid who went through a messy divorce.
Thank you for teaching your children about healthy relationships.
Love you Brittany! Just want to tell you that I know you’re sad about this because of the kids, but at the end of the day it could end up being a good thing. I commend you for doing what’s right for you, and respecting yourself enough. I grew up watching my mom be unhappy and stay in a marriage that she should’ve left, or that should’ve never happened at all. It was such a toxic situation for us, and as I got older, the resentment grew. At 36 I still have a lot of issues because I never understood why my brother and I weren’t enough for her to leave. You deserve to be happy and you deserve to  have your kids see you happy. We are all behind you and much love! 💜
Hi Brittany, honestly I watch you on and off. I did not know you were is Southern California. I’m in O.C.! So happy to hear you focusing on the positive and I know that will keep your children in good spirits. Sending positive vibes/prayers/feels your way.
Praying for you 🙏
How about mediation Brit? That was my option and it helped a lot not only with our own mental and emotional health, but with our finances. Just a tip in case you both are willing to go that way 🙏🙏🙏😊
Bravo girlfriend you are a strong resilient woman. Like you said it's your home. Let him be the uncomfortable one. You be free and open at home
Dear sweet Brittany, I’m reading between the lines based on what you shared in this video and my heart goes out to you.  I went through a Narcissist friendship and was naive about the subject. Then I happened to run across the subject online and started educating myself on Narcissism. Wow! Was it ever an eye-opener! I know you love to educate yourself on various subjects. Please Brittany,  Five words: Dr. Ramani and Richard Grannon. Wishing you and your family love and the best of everything.
Stay strong, you got this! Sending lots love and prayers your way ❤️🙏
What are the 3 red flags and orange flags? I need to know for me and what to do in that situation
Pretty sure Ryan is a narcissist—I know that’s why you’re staying silent on specifics. I’m so sorry you’re in this but I’m so glad you’re choosing to be healthy 💕   I SEE you Brittany. I love you, for all that you are and are not. You’re strong 💪 and will make it out the other side.   Love from Minnesota ❤
Awww man I'm so gutted for you. You are going to be more than ok. This phase will pass
This is why our foremothers stayed.😢 Divorce is a luxury item. It ca. Be a very bad  financial move
Spot on Brittany. When I met my husband to be I should've bolted at the first red flag but I was 22 in love. As you say if someone hurts you, shifts blame of you, accepts no responsibility for their behaviour towards you, that hurts you, you enable them if you stay. You start walking on eggshells to not set them off and that is no example to set your kids  you are 100% spot on there! Mine were 12 down to six when I got divorced and I was single for 14 years because I needed therapy to become the person who would not enable another partner to treat them like that! I didn't actively date but like you say things may happen. You have to focus on you to get strong and stay strong for your kids! May be the law in the US but here I wouldn't tolerate my ex in the house at all. Not wishing to sound cruel or worry you but what if he can't accept basic ground rules, brings a girlfriend back ( happened to my pal when their 7 year old son said " why you cuddling another lady?" The 💩 said " oh cause daddy needs cuddles and mummy doesn't love me anymore so doesn't give me cuddles ')  You strike me as a lass with her head screwed on but just be wary, set boundaries and have them legally enforced if necessary! I hope you get to keep your house as we all know what it means to you. Good luck hunni  and keep smiling..Best form of revenge is to let your other half see how happy you are without them and can indeed function without them! ❤❤❤
You are going to blossom Brittany. When it's time just tell the children daddy is going on a new adventure.
Continuing to wish you all the best, Brittany.
Taking a step away to get yourself together and healed up is so very important. I never have understood how a person could turn around a be with someone else right away. I need time to get myself together focus on my new life and most importantly my son. I couldn't handle worrying about another person's needs for quite awhile. When it's right if it is you`ll know. There isn't any shame in being in alone. Being happy is most important.
This is the saddest comment section. You people are so delusional it's honestly just sad.
💕
I feel so bad for you and the children. I will pray for you. Trust it will be okay. Your so delightful to watch.
I think you are amazing, an inspiration as I go through post partum depression and having to leave my 9 month old son. I'm not motivated, but you give me great ideas, your videos are raw, truthful, and give me a pep in my step when I feel drained and depressed.
Wow so proud of you for being a mom your kids can look up to. ❤
Thank you so much for sharing all of this with us sending you so much love and strength ❤
What did he do??😮😢
Love you, girl! Nothing wrong with being single! We all have your back, Brittany!
Brittany!❤ I want to share that I was with my narcissistic ex from 20-32 years old. It’s been 2 years of deep healing and now at 34, I’m dating again. I took my time to heal and focus on myself because like you now, I was deeply traumatized. I had sworn off dating but I believe the time will come when you just know in your heart that you’re ready again. Keep shining bright!!!✨Those who tried dimming your light will see that you shine brighter without them!✨
Go look up narcissist you will learn alot watch videos on narcissist 🚩🚩 maybe I'm wrong but sounds like what you were or and dealing whit. I feel like I seen it in some of your videos.and they never change.
Stay strong!❤
I send you, dear, my warmest hug! 🤗Wishing you calmness and joy! You are great! You are kind! Everything will be just fine! Love yea!!!😍😍
You are doing a good job with ur self and ur kids keep going. Just remind  ur self ur got this and God is always on ur side.
Just breathe. It’s going to be okay. ❤❤❤
Good advice for any type of relationship best of luck to you and the kids it may seem overwhelming now but you'll get through it.
SUPPORT SQUAD CHECKING IN! just here to send you strength + positivity! so proud of you for being able to kick that panic attack's ass before it overtook you, that is some serious growth. i know the world is heavy on your shoulders right now, but you have the strength + tools to keep moving forward. you got this! and even when you don't totally got this, you still got this. this too shall pass ❤
I'm sad that you're hurting from this! I know you are...cos it seemed that it was working so well? He was so integrated in some of your videos? I know all the red flags, Brittany...all of them! I had a live-in guy that was like the Master keepping a woman fakely Happy while galevanting with other women, (as far as Cheating?) Idk what your situation is? I've since been alone 9 years, I am now ready for a relationship, but with the right guy! Which is so daunting still...🤨
You are helping so many people by being open about what your going through!  I’m sorry you have to go through this and I pray that God will guide you and help you during this Season.
Whoa! Don’t say you are damaged.  Just wiser.   Next time it will be different.  Your kids need you more now so your focus  on them and your mental health is admirable.  Don’t be surprised though  when you are not looking is typically when someone special pops in your life.
Difficult to live with someone while the divorce goes through, I was with my ex for 9 months, I can’t say it was easy, we had 4 children. I hope it isn’t as long for you before things get sorted. I too didn’t date again and stayed single, my reasons were that I wasn’t in the right place nor did I want to introduce my kids to a man that maybe wasn’t right. It’s now been 29 years, kids are all now adults and I’m stuck in my ways and happy, I don’t feel there is any reason for a man in my life 😂 so, yes, it should be a normal thing for people to be single Good luck with everything and I hope you find happiness however that shows up for you
You are so refreshing! A gorgeous, perky person on the Internet that may seem like your life is perfect to your followers. You could have just gone with that but instead, you chose to trust us and be super brave by showing us that you are a real person just like anyone else.  I am impressed with your realness...and am rooting so hard for you and your children to get through this quickly.
I'm going on 19 years not dating and I don't miss it at all.
Please please try and settle  ....the only ones that win in a divorce r the attorneys 😢
What is Ryan’s job?
When I got divorced we still lived together for 15 months as the house would not sell.  I still have dreams that I can't get out 😢  the dating is like dumpster diving unfortunately.  After 12 years I think I'll die alone and that's OK!  Thinking about you.  You'll be just fine!❤
You are so right about justifying poor behaviour. When you catch yourself doing it - big RED FLAG! It's time to let them go. It will get 100 times worse if you don't.
Prayers, hugs, and love!
My sister divorced 35 years ago and did not date or even entertain the thought of dating again.  She is now in her 70’s and said she does wish she had a companion…sometimes!😂. It will get better, I promise!
I chose no dating after divorce and thrive to this day. So many of my ppl tried to set me up and could not understand no. I have taught my 3 daughters to be full humans sans partner. It's tough when societies push another narrative. My ex and I lived in the same home for a while until we figured out the logistics. Patience is key. Big hug 🫂
Your looking good girl!! Hang in there it gets better.
We love you Brittany 💕
I’ve definitely been enjoying my solo ride 💕 It’s been so liberating 🥰 Me my 3 and I !  My ex husband is welcome to see them anytime. Co-parenting has been pretty smooth lately.
Take whatever time you need heal. Set yourself self up with a support system that works for you. This is a suggestion for your mental health (keep it or toss it, you do you) I know you love your kids but don't forget to make time (adults only) for you. Meet with friends, family or whomever for lunch, a movie whatever have some adult fun and conversation. It helped me a lot while my husband was deployed. Living a life only about my kids was not healthy. As for Ryan just remember that has some great qualities or you would not have fallen in love with him,  besides he gave you 2 amazing kids. Focus on the good it will help you and the kids more forward.  Send positive thoughts and prayers.
Britt is done with the BS! Her kids and her peace of mind are what’s most important. We are so proud of you for pushing through! ❤ thank you for the great advice!
I have no respect for any man who walks away from his family. He has an obligation to his wife and children. Brittany, you are beautiful inside & out and deserve the best! You're a wonderful mother to your children. He will regret   his decision to leave.
I hope you are doing well. Lots of Love and warm hugs for you.I too had a panic attack today. I hope things get better😟
You are such an amazing person to watch I have learned a lot from your videos and you have a lot of support from fans that love you ❤️❤️
I’ve never commented on any of your videos, but I wanted to come here and say that I’m sorry this is happening to you. Your tips and pointers that you will teach Your kids are priceless and right on I didn’t learn these until after being married 30+ years thankfully changes were made, I will be sharing some more things with my kids. They begin looking for their partners.
You will find love again ❤
Thank you for being you!!!! I’m so proud of you and can’t imagine how hard this is to go through and also share on your channel with all of us. I feel in my heart your going to be ok and so are your kids! So many things I have always seen in you are 1. Your a excellent mama! 2. Your so smart and do all your research! 3. You have such a kind heart but also a great business sense and are good with your finances! I have followed you a long time and you have never been one to waste money ever!  So practical!  I respect you so much and you are so brave.   Thanks for being so open with us.  We are here for you of course! 🥰
You are amazing. Love and prayers 💚💚💚💚💚💚
Love you Britany!!! You are a great woman ❤
Bravo girl!! I got a divorce a few years ago and yes, the signs were there when were dating that I should have paid attention to. We got married, had 3 beautiful kids and then I found out he was cheating. I tried so hard for a few years (counseling, dealing with his drinking, him getting in a car accident from said reason, etc.) and finally I decided I couldn’t stay married to him anymore. I chose not to date because they are with him 4 days a month and he has had different women in and out the home. It breaks my heart that he would rather focus on himself and other women instead of his own children. My children will always know they come first and yours will see that too. I am still learning how to date and love myself for over 4 years now so that relationship is complicated enough to bring in another man. 😂 You are who I wished I had been 4 years ago so you are doing awesome mama!
Thank you for valuing us and sharing your feelings and situation.  So many public people don't and I find it understandable, but a missed opportunity for them and those that care.  You are great!
THANK YOU for validating the choice to be single! I made the same choice and I agree, there is so much to life and thinking that life is only complete with another person by your side is limiting. It’s one choice of so many!
I feel your pain.  Get off the internet.  Your kids won’t thank you.
Best Wishes Brittany
Thank you for always being so transparent. That’s the reason we all trust your opinion so much ❤
I leave this comment just as a support ❤
I was talking with a friend a year ago and said "Why can't I be the love of my life?? I'm the only person who is going to be there every moment of it." Taking myself places I want to go, even if I'm on my own, has been such a delight.   Rooting for you!!
It's so unfair to you to have him still living there. He needs to get packing.
My ex has been gone for close to 8 years and I’ve had one 6 month relationship about two years ago. I will be single for the rest of my life and I LOVE it!
I tend not to comment on videos but as a single mother of 3 boys, for 2 years and half now I felt like I should tell you it does get easier. As you said in your past video, this is the harder choice but once everything is concluded and you see how much more relaxed you and your kids will be (because believe me, a toxic relationship affects them as well, even if you don't realise), it's like you regain a part of yourself and you get to learn again how to be you and how to get better every day. Personally there's no comparison of who I was 3 years ago, to today and it is a process and it has tough days but overall it is so worth it. Lots of love and keep being this amazing strong woman who encourages us all.❤
You got this! ❤❤❤
Britany, I’ve have fallen more in love with you and your content ever since you shared the recent divorce episode with us. I truly believe that you’ll be a in a better place and thank you for being you.  ❤❤
It’s got to be VERY DIFFICULT living in the same house the tension must be so thick you can cut it with a knife 😩😩😩😩
I always wonder how anyone can even afford to get divorced! I definitely understand why you're not interested in dating. Being a mom takes so much energy and emotional bandwidth.
You are going to do great ♥️ I’m excited to see you happy
I was in a 14 year relationship several years ago & am still single by choice. There are def perks to this. Yes, we may change our minds down the road. Nothing to be ashamed of & it wouldn't be good for the children either at this time. You are strong & brave & you are choosing you & your kids. Thanks for sharing your journey. You will difficult times but you also have a lot to look forward to!!
So proud of you for having the courage to walk away. And yes, let's please normalize being single by choice! I'm currently not, but was for over 10 years, and I was very happy with that.
🤗🤗🤗
sweet young Brittany ..... good luck with staying single thing
so appreciative of your openness in this as i think it will help so many people - my question is didnt ryan quit his job recently to support your businesses / career? how are you guys navigating that?
My parents waited till both me and my brother were in college and did a very good job of hiding there relationship problems, as a result I grew up thinking that's what love is, I modeled all my relationships off of them because they were the relationship that lasted. When they told us they were getting divorced it hit both of us like a brick wall. And it hurt so much worse. We grew up with the four of us always doing stuff together, and I loved that so much. But when they got divorced it almost was like them telling us that they were faking the whole time. Point is, don't wait too long to tell them. I wish my parents had gotten divorced earlier. Yes it will hurt them now. But in the long run it will be better for them. Just know, they are going to get through it. Don't be like my parents. My love map is all fucked up because of them.
Love you Brittany! Big hugs from Colorado ❤
20 years and I finally stopped rationalizing his dysfuctional narcissistic behavior.. you are 100% correct, people show you who they are sometimes in the smallest of moments and after a while you've accumulated so many of those small moments that you could literally write a book on the definition of narcissism, self absorbance and gas lighting. Funny, its like god hit me over the head with an anvil and said, "sis, why are you wasting your time". Time is our most non renewable resource and we waste it on bad moments, bad connections, bad relationships and ultimately a bad future... You model for your children what they need to see.. whether its pursuiing life as a strong independent human being that has standards, good values and integrity or you choose to run around and show them an example of a broken relationship. I raised my boys to respect and honor peoples decisions and to stand on their own 2 feet, where I failed was seeing the construct and ramifications of my behavior and what it truly meant to be a partner.. I chose to stay and I regret having done so but after doing the post mortem on the relationship I can see that he was who he failed to reveal at the onset of the relationship BUT I also failed to accept it... I walked away but not only was it a better decision for my life but for them as well. They know that its not someone else's job to work out your issues and if you want to bring someone into your life you have to come to them with a true and honest heart.... I learned more about me, my vulnerability, my resilience and my past as a consequence of the divorce. I'm a better woman, mother, friend and daughter because of it and the greatest gift that I gave myself was that paper that said you are no longer a part of a disingenous relationship that will tarnish your foundation... I accept my part in the breakdown of the relationship but I mainly accept moving on to a betterr, richer more satisfying daily existance. The decision to walk away was mine and I own it... its whats made me a better mother.. you too, will succeed because you already made the choice to not accept mediocrity.. you model the right course of life for your kids and they will grow up to be fine people... that and therapy.. heeheehee... congrats brittany,, you're new journey begins..... Peggy
My heart literally aches for you guys. I experienced a huge COMPLETELY unexpected devastation in my 25 year marriage 4 years ago. (8 weeks before my daughters's wedding). I learned he had cheated. If the proof hadn't been in front of me I wouldn't have believed it. I hit rock bottom. We had 3 kids- 21, 18, 15. Even at their ages I was so scared what our separation would do. (We had been together since we were 14/15) "Luckily" for me it was a wake up call for him as well. At 10:30 one night while still decorating for our daughters bridal brunch the next day, my husband and I reconnected and prayed over our marriage. Since that day our marriage has never been better. Even though that may not be your outcome, I do pray for peace and comfort during this time for you guys. You have always been a bright spot in my day. Especially during our separation. I would crave your videos everyday and continuously watch old ones to lift me up and get me through. You are a beautiful person inside and out. Just know your platform on YouTube helps people in ways that you probably don't imagine.
I’m so sorry precious lady! I love you and praying for you! You are beautiful in every way!   I went thru this back 25 years ago and it is past words hurting.  Time helped me so much.
It would be so hard to start to heal with him still in the house.  That has to be excruciating at times.  I am so glad your folks, are near, and your girlfriends are gathering around to keep you sane in those moments of crazy you will be feeling throughout this process.  As a older woman who has seen many divorces, it’s always hard on young mothers.   Especially now that your adorable Carter is old enough to be hurt and not understand.   But, you are an incredibly amazing, smart woman.   You will get through this.   I understand the thought of another guy is about as exciting as a case of scurvy right now.   That is your own smart mind telling you that it’s time to run your life the way you want to run it.   No interference and no compromise.    Many women make the mistake of needing another man right away.  Big mistake!   They are setting themselves up for heart break.    Take time to bask in the knowledge that your life is your to create and enjoy.   When the right time comes, a great guy friend might show up to enhance your life.   If not, you are better driving your own bus.  We are so proud of you.  You are standing up for yourself and looking forward.   Your channel is doing well, and your research is so interesting and will continue to attract viewers.   I think your divorce journey will be very interesting to other ladies moving forward.    Sadly the divorce rate is so high.  A lot of women need your positivity as well as hearing how you handle those low moments.  Many many hugs, and well wishes to you all.   Judy
1000% feel you on never dating again. I’d do the same no question.
Great advice towards the end ! Well worded
I started watching your videos when I was expecting my first child and u just had your. I followed u even since. And now I am going through a divorce that is extremely similar to yours. My worries and fears are the same. I am so worried about the kids feelings. I am sorry you are going through this. But all I can say is what therapist told me”let the chips fall as they may”. Stay strong you are not alone
Horrible though this situation is you sound lighter, more energetic and allowing yourself to be you.
Brittany I am shocked to learn this news. I am going through something similar to it which made me realise what is it like to be walking on eggshells day in day out.I couldn’t be anymore heartbroken to hear this news. You have a beautiful family and children. Believe it or not I understand your heart. You have my love and embrace and earnest prayers for you everyday. I plead that I want to see you and your children filled with joy, peace and radiance in the name of Christ Lord and Savior amen.   “Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, wefn have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. 2 Through him we have also obtained access by faithfn into this grace in which we stand, and wefn rejoicefn in hope of the glory of God. 3 Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, 4 and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, 5 and hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.”
Sending you so much love 💛 I’m so proud that you’re taking care of your mental health and protecting your kids!
Keep it up, Warrior Princess. ❤️👑
After my divorce I was not interested in dating again and that was years ago. I dated a couple times and decided 8 years ago not to date again and I'm totally okay with that! And happy! I totally get it! Great idea to focus on mental health. This is the hardest part I think. Sending you lots of positive thoughts!
Thanks for the advice at the end Brittany
Date yourself. You are so cool, get to know Brittany and where she is at in life right now.
I can relate yaar, after a lot of thought I posted my ‘life update’ video today. Kare ke naa kare upload such personal details is always such a battle. Stay strong  and positive! Sending good vibes. ❤❤
Sending love Brittany 💖💖💖 we have your back and are here when you need to vent (as you see fit)😘😘
people don't click away her commercials and support her. it is especially difficult for a woman after the divorce. especially if your husband was the only one working.
Not dating is perfectly healthy. I did the same after a very traumatic divorce. I NEVER EVER EVER EVVVVVVVER wanted to be in a relationship ever again. And for 2 years I had a ball on my own with my 2 kids. Then out of the blue, when not looking I met someone only god could have sent. Married 20 years this year and still going strong. Ps my eldest was a sensitive boy too and I 100% believe being on our own for that time was what helped him feel safe and gave him time to heal. I was a calm and a constant in his life so I totally get this approach you are taking, I applaud and respect you Brittany
How does Carter not notice that y’all aren’t actually speaking? That must be so hard😢
Are your parents helpful?
Good choice. Not dating right now is an excellent idea and therapy is good too. ☮️❤️🌎
Brittany,  I am so proud of you for saying you are not going to date (that you know of). You are right to say we need to normalize being single. You are making the future about your kids and too many people start thinking about what they want and they get involved with someone. The kids are having a hard enough time with the parents’ divorce and changes then a new person is brought in that a lot of times is not a good mix with the kids. I did mental health therapy with kids and that is something I saw over and over in therapy not to mention in my personal life.
I hope everything works out for the mental health of the whole family! We are here to support you!! ❤
Always give someone a second chance……Never a third!
My mum didn’t date again till over 5 years after my parents’ divorce. It lasted a couple of years and since then (her bf and her broke up 10 years ago) she’s been really happy single and isn’t looking for something 🥰 It’ll come when you’re ready and if you’re never ready that’s fine too
You got this Brittany, I’m here for you and I’m pretty sure we are all here for you
So sorry you're having to go through this.  I'm 65 and totally related to you not wanting to date or be in another relationship.  I never remarried after my traumatizing marriage in my 20's.  I dated over the years, but I never remarried.  I couldn't trust anyone enough to be in my life and I guess I went through the red/yellow light process without knowing it.  I was never going to settle for anyone who couldn't take my feelings seriously or if they had unacceptable behaviors.  It takes time to stumble upon some of these behaviors and sometimes they jump out immediately.  I moved on once I recognized that a person wasn't the one for me.  I have friends who have remarried over and over again.  I don't get how people continue to make the same mistakes when selecting another partner.   Wishing you the best and I just want to let you know you are wise to not allow hurt feelings and loneliness to affect your decision on letting someone else into your life.  Whether it happens or not, it's your choice and you have to do what's best for you.
I am totally shocked! I have not been watching your videos because the company you use for your links do not work on my Amazon Fire tablet. I've contacted this company but they can't seem to fix the problem. FYI, they just keep asking me the same questions over and over. Anyway, I wish you the best. You are such a sweetheart and seem to be a great mommy. Take care!
Listen after my dad broke my mom heart my mom dedicated her life to raising me and my sister. My mom said that my dad broke her and had no more interest in dating. My mom lives a very busy and fulfilling life. She is happy and at peace. I wish you the best.
I do the same thing with hello fresh but I do mal prepping for lunch and dinner.  Hang in there girl 🖤 I've chosen to stay single and I think it should be normalized more.  People always buy me saying "oh you're just saying that now", no. I'm traumatized, don't want to date.
I want to see "How to be single and happy"-videos from you so badly! They would be such a help in a "you-can-only-be-truly-happy-in-a-relationship" kind of world, we seem to be living in
Can I buy any of your products in Europe?
❤👍
Could you share on what the red flags would be ?
I’m 32 and I’ve been single for over 5 years. I want a family someday, but being single is AH-mazing. I think your best years are yet to come Brittany!
So proud of you beautiful!  Prayers for you and your children.  I love your attitude!
I do, agree with you on the no dating I am not planning on it ever again either I am choosing myself this time thank you for your honesty seems like today I guess that's what is socially acceptable is if your married or in a relationship you are doing great in life but, little does society know it's not a perfect fairytale most people are afraid of getting a divorce because of what the world may think but, really it's brave to walk away and do better you do you girl I am so, proud of you and your so,  strong!!! There's no use in staying in a relationship where you aren't happy!! ❤
Brittany you have an amazing future waiting for you! ❤❤❤
Sorry about this, you All Were An Incredible Cupple.😢
As a child of divorced parents you doing something that is the best for you is the most important.  I was 7 when my parents divorced due to a mental illness my dad had.  It was the best thing she did.  She loved him very much but did not have a choice.  She decided to remain single as well and it’s been 40 years.  There is nothing wrong with that.  I will say the second thing she did that impacted us the best was NEVER saying anything negative about him.  She told him about everything (holidays, birthday,graduations) so he could come if he wanted.  She even did his taxes until his death and remained close to his family to this day (understandable if you are not able to 😊) what I’m saying is that remaining civil and never saying something negative allows your children to not think about hurting one parents feelings over the other.  They can remain children longer.  You got this! You are a strong independent woman who can do anything.
I got divorced in the early 80s with 2 sons, ages 4 and 8. Their Dad moved to another state and never kept in contact. I was a single Mom until they moved out on their own. My sons and I all went to counseling right away then they went individually. That was a lifesaver. I loved being a single Mom and my sons are very protective of me even now. You will discover things about yourself that you never thought possible. Remember to enjoy the journey 💜💙💚💛🧡
Youve got this! Can u make a bath bomb tutorial video?
As someone who went through a similar situation (minus kids) 2 years ago and has attempted to date since then - I totallllly get where you’re coming from. I am happily single and honestly it is so peaceful and I enjoy my own company so much. Not to mention the dating scene is ROUGH. just not worth the energy tbh
❤❤
Brittany, I divorced in 1996 after 29 yrs of marriage.  I said I would never remarry, I did date but never anything serious or for very long.  I did remarry in 2020, so 24 1/2 yrs after my divorce.  ❤❤
I knew the first time I met my ex-husband, he had (those) traits. You're so right! Thank you for warning!
Cheering you on no matter where your journey takes you. 😘
Brittany, you are doing great! I gotta say, there was a video after Carter was born where the topic came up that he wasn’t really altering his routine…still working out for hours, still long days away at work. And it was so obvious to me from your expression and body language that you were so hurt by that, that you were trying to smile through the pain. And he, not to be mean, but…did not really seem to care. At all. In fact, I thought he seemed a little smug and amused about it.  You can’t make a partnership work with someone who willfully refuses to even attempt to see life through your eyes. And you REALLY can’t make one work with someone who thinks your pain is funny, on any level.  I know you can’t judge peoples’ entire lives based on a video, but I will tell you, it’s been years since I saw that expression on his face, and it has stuck with me. That was the moment I was like…yeah. He doesn’t really care about her. Not compared to how he cares about himself.
Brittany,  I think it's perfectly fine to make a conscious choice to no longer date.  I have been divorced for 17 yrs and I haven't dated in more than 7 yrs and that's because I made a choice to focus on myself, my adult kids, and my grandkids. So, I think it's totally fine to give up dating. Sending love, hugs, and positive vibes!
I feel all of this after my 2 marriages (yes, made the same misstake twice, guess I am a genius….🫣) I am now older and hopefully wiser and will not rush in to another marriage 😅 I do however have a new (actually great) man in my life after swearing off men forever, and if for some reason I would end up single again I would probably become a nun. 😅 No need for dating new potential losers and spending my energy on all that jazz. 😂🙈 Your tips are really usefull. Hope you can sort all if this out asap and take care of your mental health ❤❤❤
Also let's normalize that You can be perky, you can talk with enthusiasm, but still be sad on the inside. We don't have to talk or act like winnie the poo's Eyore whenever we're going through something. Whatever way you need to be or act to process hardships and hang in there, that is correct for you, as long as it's not destructive then no one's opinion but your own matter😘.
Good for you being single and embracing single life.   This is much more likely to turn into a healthier relationship in the future if you ever DO want to explore that.   Especially with kids in the picture,  you're giving them such a good picture of thoughtfully moving through life.  ❤
Are you listening to Breakup Boost? If not, do! It’s a very good podcast!
We support you, Brittany! ❤ I’m glad you’re taking care of yourself during this difficult season!
Praying that you have peace very soon. Been through this . I know you said you weren’t looking for another relationship, but I am with my husband of 13 years we both have daughters. I never knew men treated women with so much respect , honor and love. He never insulted me ever! He never retorts when I have my bitchy moments. He has always treated my girls like his own. We have grandchildren now. Anyway  I totally respect your decision to not want to date but maybe don’t turn it away in the future. Kids leave the nest. You deserve to be treated like a queen. ❤🙏🏻🤗 I’ve been a subscriber for 12 years.
I never liked Brian  ....Or is it Ryan?
I am so sorry that you have to go through this and on top of having him in the house!  I hope you can resolve this quickly and you can move on. Financially, this means you have to give him half of all you have earned. Can’t blame you for not wanting to get involved with anyone again. You are strong, a good person and a great Mom, always remember that.
You got this, can I please ask are you still on Zoloft? Only asking to see if it’s still helping? Going through my own stuff.
When you talked about the red flags, that hit home. I have a lot of thinking to do now 😢 sending you love Brittany ❤
You got this mama! I have been watching you since toddler Carter days and I will always watch your stuff! Please let us know if we can give you video suggestions!  Cleaning hacks, money saving tips, book recommendations, vlog of a day out with the kids crafts with the littles! We are here to watch it all!
You’re an inspiration. I’m single going on 5 years now but dealing with finances and health scares alone I started to panic a lot this past month so seeing you be so strong and meditating and taking care of you really helps me but I know you have a lot more support. Thank you for sharing. ❤
Kids are adaptable and will be ok. This must be so hard for you, especially with him still in the house. Hope he’s out soon so you can continue to heal and start to enjoy this new chapter of your life. ❤
Such a tough time but, you got this.  Hang in there.
Honestly, I wish I would not have dated while my kids were young. After my divorce, I was not in a healthy place mentally. I used dating to compensate for how terrible I felt about myself. Taking care of kids as a single parent is more than enough to handle. I quit dating several years ago (my kids are now adults). I kept picking the same type of guy, and I realized that I was the common denominator. I've spent the last several years working on myself, went to law school, and I still am not dating. Maybe one day, but I am very content with the way my life is. Bringing another person into it is scary, but maybe some day.
I totally feel you. I've been single for a long time now. Have no desire to date again. I love my animals, I love saving animals and that is good enough for me.
If I got divorced I would not get in a serious relationship ever again or possibly even casually date.  Too much of  lone wolf and honestly if this relationship were to fail, I'd have no more faith in love. It's okay to be independent!
I also made the decision not to date and focus on raising my kids. Best decision ever. My kids are now adults and I count them as friends along with my lady friends and a few male friends. I’m now in my 60’s and couldn’t be happier.
Proud of you! You're killing it.
Thank you for sharing,  we care about you & your well-being 💚 What you accept, you teach’ and ‘What you allow, will continue’ are 2 wise sayings that have helped me see/stop/avoid the things that can seem small at the time, but can become huge issues. They work in most aspects of life & relationships; including jobs, parenting & even pet care!
You can be so proud of yourself that you got yourself out of the panic attack 👍 Well done! ❤️ You’ve got this! ❤️ You are stronger than you know 🥰 When the time comes to tell your kids you will be even stronger and I’m sure you will find the right words ❤️
Good luck and hugs ❤
Love and prayers for you and your family. ❤
I am wondering if he is batting for the other team?
You will make this through, we have your back. ❤
Hi Brittany, I want to say how much I appreciate all of your content. It helps me a lot my kids are about the same age as yours so your hacks and other mom stuff be right on time. Thank you for sharing and being so vulnerable with such an intimate situation. You give me such inspiration, you are a superwoman!! 💜
I’m so proud of you.
Oh I just love the polite shade...I really like the more open Britney.
You are so brave. Taking action towards being happy or happier is difficult, but in the end it feels great. And that's the most important example for your kids! We are here for you, even if we don't know each other 💕
My good friend got divorced last summer and it was and still is very traumatic for her and her children. The stories I have heard about her ex since then blow my mind. You were 100% correct when you said if someone shows you their true selves believe them the first time!!! Don't just make excuses for them. Thank you for sharing ❤ sending positive vibes your way.
💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝 DECISIONS ARE MADE ON BOTH A CONSCIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS LEVEL...WHEN TWO DECISIONS DONT AGREE WITH EACH OTHER, WE EXPERIENCE ANXIETY...💝
For that money your lawyer should kick that cheater out of your house. It is so unhealthy... I wish you strength to deal with this and then happyness which you well deserve!❤
I’m a homebody too! You have a beautiful home. Glad you are staying ❤ Do your hair girl and keep doing you 😊
Normalize wanting to be single!  Yaaaaaas!
I agre, embrace single life! I'm older than you Brit, Im mid 40s. single mom. I talk to my girlfriends about this, I think I'll just be single for life. Thank You for sharing this very painful period you'rr going through. Praying for you and the kids. ❤
I’m sure you have considered.  Could you move in with your mom? Sell the house?
“I’ve seen what I needed to see and …no” girl I FELT this
You are so brave. Thank you for being open and setting an example of doing what is right even if is a harder path. ❤
I am with you all the way through this traumatic time Brittany and sending you love and kind thoughts..........stay strong x
You are stronger than you know. You are such an inspiration. Your kids are going to admire you for being so positive and strong through this.
Getting married is inexpensive. Getting a divorce can bankrupt a person.   I’m in California and it took 3 years to get my divorce finalized.
Girl, I’m so sorry your going through this!!!!   I did question his devotion to the marriage a long time ago. When he chose to continue working so far away. The travel time and all is not healthy for a relationship. Yes some people can do it. It requires a lot of work and I was hopping you two would make it.   Also, his inability to change when Carter was born. He had to keep working out, plus traveling to work. He was away from the two of you to much. It’s easy to creat a separate life in that circumstance. I know from experience 😁.
You are amazing and you’ve got this!
I admire you so much Brittany. The best things are ahead, for you and your precious children. ❤❤
I really hope you will reconcile with Ryan. Not just because of your children, but mainly because of them.
Yep! You have a new journey ahead, it’ll be bumpy at times just keep on doing what feels right for you and yours. Really proud of you.x
Brittany as someone who got divorced age 30 with 4 kids I knew he wasn’t my person, we grew up together for a 11yrs and I was told the man I wanted was only available in a fairytale 😅 but I concentrated on my kids and growing and working through the trauma. I did manifest that exact man I imagined. I’m in England and he’s American lol we’ve been together 7yrs now even though I’ve had 3 strokes. He’s amazing!  P.s I saw years ago from intuition that he wasn’t your person. Your energies don’t match, you’re sweet and needy in a good way lol you seem like me to need reassurance 💓💛💓 love you 💓💛💓 xx
❤❤❤❤
Have you ever considered doing finance videos. I remember you talking about it a long time ago, but I would live to hear your financial tips and learn some things.
Your appreciated, your beautiful, your kicking arse!!
I love watching your commentary makes me sad that you’re going through something like this because I’m wondering if this is about to be my life as well but what about the bedsheets? I don’t know why I feel like you were supposed to be making us some bedding.
Bravo! I agree with the not dating thing. When I went through this, I was so focused on replacing the male role model in my children's home that I settled for less than the ideal partner. This also ended within 5 years and did more damage than good. My youngest was 14 when I tried again, making sure I took 2 years to make sure the choice was right and it also ended a decade later. My youngest was long since on her own but the damage was done for me as well as for her. I've been healing from this last one for almost a decade now with no desire to ever partner up again. I'm truly fine on my own but I am starting to consider the idea of a companion of some sort but the living together thing turns me off immensely. You are going to do very well! I❤🙂
You are going to get through this and come out on the other side. One day at a time.
🙏🏻❤️😘😘😘💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Such a sweet person you are .  Your future is so bright because you are a successful business woman
I know some things take time but Everything will be okay. 😊 Keep your head up and focus on you and your kiddos.
Girl, never say never. If you've got and eaten rotten food and got sick, it doesn't mean ALL food is rotten. It means you've chosen a rotten food from a store and need to LEARN how to choose a healthy and beneficial food instead. Please learn as you're a young and beautiful woman! There are enough of decent and great men out there that want someone like you!
We need to normalize being single but unfortunately US isn’t setup for single lifestyles $$$
I totally thought the same. I will never date again. Then, I found the best man ever and married him 😂 But, being single is wonderful
My mom told once, we bring on our own anxiety by the negative thoughts we think. Touch a chair, go outside and touch your car. When our minds go into fight flight mode nothing around us feels 3D. When you can physically feel things it actually calms your mind. And yes, my divorce was like this too. Brand new car price.
I have so much respect for you and how you are doing all the things to keep mentally healthy for yourself and for your kids!!! Good for you @brittanyvasseur. I’ve been watching you since your son was a tiny wee little baby! I love your channel and will continue to watch as you are one of my first I click on every chance I get…❤much love to you and the babies 💕
No one can afford divorce, it’s shocking how much it costs. I went into a lot of debt for mine. You’re doing so great and you are so strong!! ❤
I was traumatized by my cheating boyfriend and now I don’t see me ever dating again.  He attacked my body when I had breast cancer and used that as an excuse for his vulnerability.  I had gained 30 lbs from the drugs.  I’ve since lost all the weight but the damage was done.  BTW, he cheated on me with his second cousin.  They are still together.
I am truly amazed at your honesty in pushing forward during the hard emotions and staying focused on growth, learning, and now sharing with us. You  never know how your words (loved the 'dating advice to your kids-red & orange) will help someone else identify, or act, when in a bad situation. TY so much, and day -by-day, you are getting stronger.
I think never say never. Your kids will leave home one day and I get it - not right now.
Brittany, I’m sorry for what you’re going through, we’re with you❤.  What do you think about setting up like a go fund me, that we can donate to help you through this ?
You are amazing!  You are living for the happiness of you and your children.  Stay strong!  💜
My daughter tried HelloFresh and I liked the meals, but I was shocked at the amount of packaging/trash that came with it! There’s no way I can do that!
Home....can always be ANYWHERE....THERES SELF 💕!!CARE🤓😎💚🤍💙💜😹🍀 RApid support Squad!!$$
Take care of yourself. New relationship is not good idea now, but have some fun with men, you are young beautiful women, don't miss lifetime.
I so appreciate you sharing this!!
Oh sweetie, your kids don't know and you're still in the same house? You haven't gone through anything yet. I'm so sorry, hugs to you and remember you will get through this and you might look back at these videos one day and think "oh the innocence", lol!
I have a question regarding the meal prep: does it mean you're eating the same thing 5 times a week? 😳
It must be so difficult to be living in the house together!
Sending you all the positive energy and thoughts! I 100% agree with you that being single should be an acceptable life choice! You may change your mind in the future or you may not… as long as you are happy then it doesn’t matter.
No wonder you had a panic attack when you got such a bill! I know things in California are more expensive, but that is crazy expensive! Bless your heart Brittany, you are handling this as best you can and keep the positive vibes going. I think you will be fine but it's never easy. We are behind you and we will support your channel and help in any way we can. Blessings!
Did you have a prenup??
If you guys dont talk with the eacother in front of the kids they will know something is wrong. If you only communicate in texts this is going to hurt them.
Divorce SUCKS 😣💔!  Many thanks for sharing  very personal matters & giving your relationship advice 😊. Keep on keeping on🥰😍😘!  Hugs & kisses to your beautiful children💗.
Not dating again is NOT dramatic. I went through the same chapter 3 years ago. I just focus on my daughter and myself. I can totally understand you ❤  The only person I date is MYSELF. When she's visiting her dad. Every other week I go on Solo dates. Yesterday was my birthday and you know what? I went on a solo date and bought myself a ring.❤ I learned that it is  awesome to fall in love with a man but the moment you start to fall on love with YOURSELF is a beautiful experience...
👍
❤❤❤Brittany, you’ll be fine. Eventually you’ll start dating again and feeling much better. Not all men are scum out there. I’m telling you! 💐💕😊
Red flag is HIM CHOOSING TO STAY IN HOME WOTH YOU AWHILE KNOWING DIVORCE IS ON....GET OUT BRIT GRL!!
Sending you all of the hugs and well wishes.
Thank you for being a bright light and focusing on the positive even in such a difficult situation. Sending you and the kids lots of love 💕
Dont freak out if he has a new girlfriend pretty fast, most men thats been in long term relationships seem to get back on the "horse" very quickly.
❤
NEVADA... 3 WEEKS RESIDENCY AND 3 DAY DIVORCE...🫡
Aw I really feel for you specially Carter, I’ve been with you since Carter’s birth when I was pregnant with my first son now I have a 3yo daughter and I’m trying to leave their dad but it hurts my son so much😢 he’s the sweetest kid and it kills me to see him sad over his dad
We’re behind you, Brittany and you touched on things that are important. Love and Hugs. ❤❤❤
I totally understand why you choose not to date!
Great video!
I haven’t seen a full minute yet. I have to say something. That curler thing is HUGE. Love you ❤
That’s crazy, which is why we never used a lawyer!! If you can work together on assets etc…it’s very possible!  Damn lawyers take too much
I just clicked on your hellofresh link and got a message that said the offer couldn't be applied.
Honestly I'm so proud of you! Where do you get the makeup brushes you mentioned?
Don’t forget … you are fabulous !
Always remember doing what’s best for you is doing what’s best for your kids. A child never ever wants to see their mom 😢ever so I’m glad your healing and doing what’s right for the whole family.
Next question to address, did you fire him? 😂 glad to see you pushing thru! You got this !!
❤
Keep on keeping on hun with so much love from Michigan ❤❤❤
Divorced???????????? What
Thank you for sharing ❤❤
“What you tolerate, you encourage” I felt that!!! ❤❤❤
I've been on baby break and haven't watched YouTube in a while. WHAT happened? I'm shocked. When did they break up?
So sad to see this video. Prayers for you and your family. I hope you find a happy place for yourself and your children ❤️
You are doing great.  When I divorced, I did the same as you and stayed away from relationships and have not regretted it at all.  But I must say I could never live in the same house as my ex while the divorce was going on.
Brittany I want to just say I'm supporting you 100%! I have been through it all myself, marriage of 21 years three beautiful boys. It's so painful! The hardest thing is your worry you will ruin your kids,lol I'm just saying because you know, keep doing what you're doing! You definitely have a great attitude and I love watching you channel. I'm looking forward to seeing you and your kids future 😊 Hugs to you all
Thank you for your all attitude. Please feel to your viewers request/comments and try on michi/micro bikini cloths haul. With Thank.
I'm so happy to hear you say we need to normalize being single. It's a perfectly valid way to live happily. Go for it!
You got this!!! I’m literally on the other side of the country but I’m here for you, and your family. I’ve been here since you were making bath bombs before you met Ryan! lol and I’ll be here long after everything settles. You were my inspiration with my baby who shares carters birthday! And you’re a strong woman. If I could fly out there to hold your hand through this I would. We all love you so much and we are all here for you. ❤
Good for you for embracing the single life for now I’m there and planning on staying that way ❤
I have a house w my ex too. We live in the same house, I lived in the guest room since November of last year. We talk but just Hello but nothing more than that. I work a lot and he works a lot. I work at night, and he works during the day, and that helps us avoid each other. I have a daughter who left for college last September.  I hope to move away by the end of this year. I am ready to leave all behind.
You got this !! Dont doubt it for a second !!💖
Sorry, you're going through divorce. I know the feeling. Stay strong.
Awesome, great video.  Stay strong with soft moments in between cry when needed ,hugs
Brittany. My mom always told me it’s better to be alone than to be in bad company. Green Goddess rules. 🥰
You're amazing! Your channel and IG has helped me so much for a while now. 🤗 Wishing you all the best. 💖
After my divorce it’s almost been three years now still filing my paperwork  it’s taking forever I also said I would not date or be with any man because I was so traumatized from my physical and emotionally abusive marriage. It’s three years now and I have not even been slightly interested in any one im happy on my own and my daughter and working on me piece by piece. You do whatever feels easiest for you!
I swear 90 percent of men just cannot be trusted! You are doing the right thing for now!!!!
I'm glad you're staying close by family, making the necessary plans, ect. it's going to help you and the kids so much.❤ I'm also glad to see you take it slow with the dating.  girl, it can TOTALLY wait.😄

Omg I'm sending you a big hug and I hope things get better in every way  Coming from someone who went through this three years ago, this get so so much better especially for the kids
Good morning from Oceanside  We are neighbors.  Brittany I’m so glad you are doing better. 15 years after my divorce everything it’s better then ever.
I agree single ppl get so much slack when a lot of the time they're happier than couples! Having a good group of friends and family is underrated!
I see a smile, there's light at then of the tunnel. Good for you,
Oh you look more radiant. I just know that you will come up on top. You will totally be okay!
So happy to see you are doing well. Wishing you all the best Brittany we love you.
I wish you all the best
