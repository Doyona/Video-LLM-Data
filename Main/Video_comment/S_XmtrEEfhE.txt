GAIEND BLENDER
14:46 estop estop
Never thought i would see a fridge in a blender
This is what I usually do to my ceiling fan every day😂😂😂
I love they don’t even blend they just kinda explode as soon as there dropped
The fact that the generator and motor started smoking and then the e-stop didn’t work might of been the most terrifying thing I’ve ever seen
Indonesia How Ridiculous
I think my next band will be called "Surfing the Blender"....
10k? Way too many golf balls!!!
Psycho
Ssyco
HOLY CRAP! That blender needs to be at least 16.5ft tall or more. 😱😱😱😱😱😱
¡Pslycho!
i loved this idea ! A giant blender !
Omg that was the scariest thing I’ve ever witnessed!
Will it blend... *_ON ACID_*

Make the blender a tornado maker 😊
IS BIG...
Would love to see this channel banned…. Complete and utter shame of the pollution this channel causes.   Disturbing and disgusting the lack of any common sense
😅s
Omg that’s crazy
I reckon you pumped so much power into the VDR that it probably shorted the bit that controls the speed. But then again I don't have a circuit flow chart or how you wired the Estop in
Ammmmmmmm😅
No
Of course u would 1:34
Why not try out a bullet proff glass on the blender. 1:50
Yes 5:55

The surf board found the wrong thing to surf
How I imagine the conversation goes with your design guys:  "We want to make a custom blender that can blend a bowling ball, a-"   "Dang. Okay, we should be able to do that."  "AND a surfboard, an-"  "Oof, thats going to have to be really big, but theyre relatively soft, so we might be able to do that..."  "AND golf balls"  "Oh, well we can certainly do that!"   "10,000 of them...  simultaneously..."  😐
Your engineers and fabricators must have such a love/hate relationship with you guys 😂
This versus oobleck?
You should put a ballistic dummy in the blender
The blender should go to 44
7:34 7:35 7:37 7:38
The thumbnail looked so clickbait ngl (I dont hate it tho)
Blender vs hammer?

Only discovered your channel and I am binging. You should visit South Africa there are some awesome challenges you can do here

Toxic masculinity!
So much more relaxing without the annoying kiwis blathering on about nothing
That machine is fuking terrifying lmao
Did you drain the refrigerant out of the refrigerator before you blended it?
Waaaoow keren..🎉🎉salam kenal
BOOOOOM 4:43
pour some water in it and it becomes the worlds biggest manmade whirlpool
Little did anyone know.. e stop was actually supercharge 🤣
You guys waste money on the most ungodly things. If you'd put that money towards something more constructive you'd be amazing. Instead you prove how wasteful you are building things that are not useful at all.
Surfboard dust... Don't breathe this.
You guys are so funny 😂😂😂😂😂
I would not be standing inside that thing 😮
Try blending full basket of Talking Vanellope von schweetz dolls
Try blending a bunch of big, or just normal diffrent fruits
14:40 POV: The reactor core is going meltdown
The surfboard was “like Michael don’t leave me here”
so cool 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤😊❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉
Well I’m extremely impressed that it actually blended!
Me doing a video with them "a win here is if none of us die" LOL
c'est pitoyable ... vous en faites quoi des déchets ?
It’s kinda like Toy Story 3
How ridiculous where's the blender now

We Built The World's Largest Blender! How Ridiculous love louis shirley
A community lunch/ fair/ get together.
I just had agreat idea.why dont you put together a massive how ridiculous fair and either set it up so the community shots fruit into the blender useing the water ballon launcher slingshots or fill it your self; also lots of merchandise,invite mark rober and other people from YouTube channels to set up thier own stalls with science and  entertainment?
Psycho
This blender looks like something from the SAW movies, like you would have to press a button in the centre or you get lowered into it
Io

I want that tv
I really wanted that french too
I really wanted that stuff board
10:03 R.I.P spider.💀💀💀
I think the cat wanted to get blend up
You should turn the blender into a siren, How a siren works is the faster the motor, the higher the pitch of the sound.
We need more speed >:)
is stop
The final one causing an "out of control" situation feels like such a movie thing
Put the cow in there
I just wanted a milkshake
VFD! (variable frequency drive), I suppose you coulcall it both though😂
Do a giant shredder next
how did he do that? That’s as fast as an airplane or maybe faster than an airplane or faster than Concorde or maybe faster than every private jet combined 2:08
If I was in there, I could’ve been dead 1:19
Splatoon 3 ahh blender
E-stop not working is genuinely so scary

This is sadness fain 😢😢
Poor surf board😢
Wow good job
That’s so good
You built a giant blender. What did you think was going to happen?
Next time by 6 million golf balls
I've been watching How Ridiculous for years now, never have I ever seen a moment that made all three of their hearts hit the floor like that since Rexy almost died after a tower drop collision
🤯o m g
The bowling ball off the dam sounded like a gun shot
7:21 as soon as it was blended, the graphics on my iPhone just when low.
Well, that dangerously💀
14:37 Is anything blending!? IDK!
you guys should make the worlds bigst smoothy and get all your friends and drink it
I hate myself for enjoying this. So much resources are wasted on this senseless destruction. Yet I continue to watch it. lol
🗨️😇
more "destruction" please 😅
14:42  “We have failsafes” he says Yeah sure, if y’all did then this would’ve never happened
The last bit at the end i think i could have been a diesel runaway effect.
2:15 How good was that.😅❤
Gaunson looking at the VSD was...Suprisingly cool. With all the childish shenanigans I forget these guys probably have a helluva bunch of experience
IT WILL BLEEND
You had your Chernobyl,  AZ button, emergency stop moment. Power increased instead of stopped. Welcome to the Chernobyl/How Ridiculous club. 👍
That was one bemused bovine!
"Well that's not in one piece anymore."
Next up: making a giant milkshake in the giant blender.
Oh whoa whoa WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA 10:13
The 1k golf balls. The e stop doesn't work and smokes come out on the glass
Im trying to find some splatoon fans in the comments. Those golf balls represent test subjects.

why is gauson in the blender?!
Graat u guys use the worst for last. But than use a fake clickbait tumbnail from that part to lure u in. Sad. Thank god i skipped the rest
I hate the orange dot and green dot That means someone is using your microphone.
Bro.  That is so huge. That blender is so huge. I Make that by my own.
Какого хера так  орать
This would be great to see with ooblek
I know it’s dead, I know it’s unplugged, but mate standing in amongst that murder blade still gives me chills so bad 😂
Get a bunch of ice cream and milk and make the worlds largest milkshake

Make a bigger blender to blend the big blender
Ludicrous speed
1:52 gta san andreas start music
What motor ??
07:16 I assume this was without a compressor etc? Why? ;(  It seems to me that there is a certain frequency you hear back from the "blender" when it's "really going to fu*k something up"? Or is that just me?
03:07....oh...er...You'd have thought it would....well do a bit better with less mess as it were!  I thought to tennis balls we're damned good!  If there's something you don't put in your trap, NOTHING you should ever consider dealt with when in a trap is.....? (Nerd'ism at it's finest!)

Love y'all's videos, but the blender thing? My opinion,sorry, but it's a fail. Not funny. Not nearly as cool as all the others
Im 31 and still pray to start a team like this !!!
That blender at the end was going NUCLEAR!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You all missed the space balls ludicrous speed joke
imagine what the cows were thinking
I thought The Blender was going to go NUCLEAR!😂 When E-Stop fails, time to bail! Nice one, fellas.
So people tell me that a fridge can will stand against a nuclear blast are they sure🤨
you guys are so amazing
There should've been a blade close to the floor to scoop up the stuff laying there
Thought for sure they'd burned out the motor, with all that smoke.
If you put it in reverse, does it put all of the bits and pieces back together?
You need to blend blocks of ice!!!
World largest blender guinness world record
"bois is there anything broken" MMMMMMMMMMM I DONT KNOW
You should do this again but with forensics gel human models with fake blood  and skeleton inside
this blender is for casheoh
4:15 he had to look to confirm what he was voting
🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺
I think you might have slightly toasted the windings on your motor there.  Edit: Im glad that the generator had a E-stop that actually functions, otherwise there could have possibly been an arc flash or an electrical fire on either the motor windings or in the ESC or in the generator. Close call!
Do all people from Australia have oversized teeth?🤨
This thing must be powered by Diesel engine, two-stroke Detroit Series 71 for example. Clutch and speed controls by air, like old friction cranes.

@how ridculous - what are you guys background (education etc) to be able to come up with these ideas and execute it amazing
This totally reminds me of the old channel " Will It Blend? ", but on a whole new level
5:18
I think you guys should have added ice. Lol
What hit the bowling when they dropped it
Bowling ball smoke - Don't breathe this.
Jesus was sure standing in the flames with you wasn’t He? 😅 or box/room
I think that cow is trying to say, put the bell on
Bro when I saw the E-Stop do nothing I wanted to run for you
Imagine making the world's biggest smoothie in the blender and then swimming in it
I thought the machine was gonna explode when the golf balls were in
D thanks ff FCC extra
That blender is freaking awesome! I wonder what else you could make on that machine.
It's your extention cords, to much resistance: to long with to small a gauge of wire - see this frequently with power tools.
Toyota Supra: If you put the watermelon and a catalope  into the giant blender, that’s disgustE 🤢🤮
If there was a face for pure terror Stanford was it, Herron straight up made peace and was ready 😂
Do ax versus blender
Hey How Ridiculous I'll get you a new surfboard
The blade assembly is like a water lily from hell
Lol the tennies
It’s certainly fascinating but so disturbing as well. What if god forbid a person was thrown in?  I’m sure you’re giving Vladimir Putin or Kim Jong Il ideas for a new terror device.
Can you shoot 10,000 golf balls with the cannon? 😂
A part of me wishes someone had stopped the blender when the surfboard managed to surf on the blades for like 10 seconds. I'd have bought that, honestly. What a tenacious item. True icon.
in 1922 Steven Poplawski was the first man to mount an agitating element into a simple glass contained. IT HAS BEEN OVER 100 YEARS! the fact this was not done before SPITS IN THE VERY FACE OF HUMAN PROGRESS! and yet my right to buy a blender for 99p remains unfulfilled!
Missed opportunity to label a speed setting "ludicrous"
10:21 is why the e-stop didn't work obviously!!

jump in there please
So cleaning after would be impossible, meaning that all the cows in the background just eat all these little bits of plastic after with the grass? Well, anything for views, so…
Sharpen the blades a little bit
Surprised Rexy or his dino cousins weren't up to the challenge on this one!
Why didn’t y’all line the shirts in there and drop the ink
Next thing you have to do is just drop peop- I mean, anima- I mean, carcasses into it.
Part 2 is probably out by now, but i would rewire the power supply through a e-stop circuit breaker.
Stop
OK let’s get a little bit off the point my question is how the heck do you build big things like this you must have been having a lot of people help you build these huge things
I love the idea that if you want to sound Australian all you have to do is add "ies" to every noun.
😱😨
5:12
put a human pls
Need the will it blend music
Tough glass
NEW TVS ARE LIGHT BULBS THEY SUCK BIG SHITTY BALLS I LOVE MY PLASMA 60IN!
You guys need to see what the damage would be to a ballistics dummy I think that would look awesome to show what would happen if you actually fell in that thing LOL
What just happened was it was all staged
10:13 oh oh oh whoa whoa whoa
put rexie in
7:34 7:38
Does australia not have a standards body that specifies estops to physically cut power and be on a separate system
🇬🇧❎🇹🇭✅
Wonder what that would do to that 🐄 ?
Can you please give me a one of a golfball club
I'm just happy you put the picture of y'all unplugging it and you pointed out you unplug it because when a lot of the different objects I always worry about that the same with like the helicopter spinning thing I hope you all unplug those two

The problem was when they hit the E-stop, the first thing that entered the blender wasn't boron. It was graphite.
Trying to go to bed and hate spiders thanks a lot 🙏
the enda the blenda
You guys should clean up that giant blender if Mark Rober wants to use it to blend watermelons
That cow in the beginning caught me off guard
Next merch idea for the blender. Blend stuff and then make an epoxy paperweight cube! Love the content.
Honestly, there is no other channel on youtube that lives up to it's name as much as this channel.
And that kids is what happens when you turn it up to TURBO
Should have put a cow in there
You've gotta try the giant rubber band ball next time!
Error 56: Data timeout 😀
Surfing!!!  Wtf?!?!?
HAVE YOU TRIED A BALISTICS DUMMY? THAT WOULD BE AWSOME! :)
of all channels you guys are mad!
That surfboard must have seen action at Bell's Beach. What a ride!
Please post to video blend Tesla !!!!!!,
I dont really know but I think it started running away kinda like an engine running away if you've ever heard of that. you did the right thing going right for the power source. Good on ya.
As a Yank from NYS, I've gotta admit, this video was pretty damned cathartic.
what if you have the VFD bring it to speed then switch to mains power? what HP is the motor?
Will it blend? That is the question.
Was that the golf set from a Cashies (Cash Converters) from way over in Adelaide?? 😏😅 (like this if you are a fellow DankPods watcher *and* get my reference!)
6:29 plot armour be like:
Hi ❤
im resubscribing for the note to safety inside the blender. safety first
Years ago...3 boys uploaded a basketball trick shots video....did they ever think at that time, that one day, years later, they'd be throwing random items in a massive blender in a cow pasture?
I was worried about the cows...
😂 Why???
aw hell nah they found the four thangs and are about to go to the promised land
What's the point? Seriously? You guys seem pretty smart.... But you should spend time to BUILD things, not destroying things. I don't appreciate you ruining objects just for your entairnment. It's not fun tbh. You can do better as a living for sure.
Blender went past hyper speed and went plaid.
They are pretending to be mr beast 😂
Underrated channel when compared to mr. beasts views. You guys bring jaw dropping content, like, my mouth will uncontrollably open in amazement.
This episode was a nice blend of some things you should and shouldn't put in one of these😂😂  We have always wondered what they're capable of 😂😂
😂😂 the seriousness in there "woah!" When they saw the melons just GO! 😂😂
be honest, we all thought of someone falling in.
Glad everything turned out okay in the end. How scary!
Will it blend? That is the question.
When you want to provide the legion with smoothies
14:22 - 15:10 bro they created  the average introduction to an action movie
Unsubscribed.  Love what you have done over the years. I've been a big fan.  But "The E-stop is not working" and subsequent discussions are just too much.  Take your lives seriously, even if online you aren't.  I'll maybe pop in later to see if you are getting serious about safety. But right now? You should all face legal action, frankly.
You guys are such BOYS 😂 and I love it
that looks like angry bees attacking at 4:36 XD
i love that the cows are just so unbothered. i want to be a cow
If the E-Stop doesnt work ... i would say something is terrible wrong wired.
jigsaw in real life
WHERE ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH DID THEY GET A GIGANTIC BLENDER
i thought the thumbnail said 10,000 goofballs. ._.
Will it blend? That is the question.
odd question, what do you do with all the trash? are you able to recycle it? does local garbage take it????
Gaunson is pretty damn smart
With that failure with the emergency stop, maybe a partnership with Destin from SmarterEveryday to produce an in depth video or video series on planning a project and integrating safety measures throughout the planning and operation stages, as well as a post incident review process for when things still go wrong, like here, would be a good idea.
One of your best videos EVER!
Crazy lol
Drop a CRT television that will be epic
You guys should invest in ballistics gel to show the "human" outcome of "what if"
Man sees things blending, man good
New execution machine unlock
SBLENDID!!!!
the surfboard was hilarious
it’s like they’re playing garry’s mod in real life
Safety or not I would not hop inside to clean I'd stand outside and clean it watched to many final destinations 🤧
Kenapa mendongak ke atas tu? Tengok apa?
Stipudist purchase I don't regret. I bought 3 of the gold balls. 😂
"Will it Blend? That is the question."
Fellas had an AZ-5 moment
That surfboard wanted 1 last 🏄‍♂️
That is 100% why the e stop is only allowed to be a hard wired physical break...not wired into a PLC program
The dude in green cap, need to stop using meth, it shows very well now!
comment f to pay respects to mr surfboard
Anyone able to tell the brand of the drive? 100 hp? Maybe more?
I am a giant blender fan now
thats what happens when you write PSYChO on your blender haha
Will it blend? Yes, yes it will.
Green hat guy is spending all his money on party & drugs.... 😢
Don’t waste food in your videos Please .
YouTube channel
Varshakilife vlog very good vlogr
You should do beyblades
The surf board was like never back down what?...
Smoke was probably coming from the belts connecting motor/blender. Smoke from generator just happens when diesel generators are operating near/over their limit.

How are you going to dispose all of the trash?
c'est pourrit
Am I the only person to wonder what would happen if they dropped the cow into the blender ?
Madddddnessss
can't wait for you guys to do a episode with mr beast
Wasting of time
y should put in a cow
😅
Man the guys are ridiculous
An e stop should always  kill power to the device, not control wires
e-stop should cut power to the whole thing, and a reset button should be needed after disengaging the e-stop  in this case I would make that without electronics, purly with buttons, contactors (retails) and so... :)
You guys are funny😂
3:05 3:08
This is the first ever time seeing this channel and i have to say you guys are like old TGF to the extreme like wtf😂
Put one on them cows in there
You burnt the motor drawing more powe than 12000 watt
Test a human!
You must adjust indonesian audio for more view
what's next? A giant washing machine?
... to quote an old youtube series....."Will it Blend? lets find out" "Blender smoke... Don't breath this"
The giant blender sound 💀💀💀
AUNTY EM AUNTIE EM!!
This is what happened at Chernobyl
😂👍
please make tsar bomba shake.
As someone who works with pc's and COM ports, do not trust them, when you loose comunication, even restored it won't respond till you restar the software
If only you could have put like a cow or something 😂
Wow "How Ridiculous" is that!
Wow "How Ridiculous" is that!
Wow "How Ridiculous" is that!
Thanks
It may not be able to start but he's still standing on a wet surface with big swords at his feet
14:57 Gatorade
when e-stop doesnt turn off, you know something has gone wrong
Ahhh yeess I F*cking love the blender please more
انجب خوش
A giant blender. How ridiculous
I want Stanford to get in it

"We can't turn it off, but we could turn it back on again so we should be good for part 2..."
Finally a use for old golf clubs.
Ненормальные... Осталось кому-нибудь из вас туда запрыгнуть и посмотреть что будет...
Should have filled the fridge with Orbees.
Satisfying
What if the dial was more like a wheel of fortune but with RPM and you spin the arrow to select a speed
How much hp on that thing 😅
“Will it blend”, not that’s proper old skool YouTube! ❤️
I’d bet that smoke was belt slip
Would have liked those clubs😅
هلا
I wish you guys went more in-depth on how the machines works and built, such videos would actually be interesting
Hello cow 🐄 experiment traiying go bro....❤
The golfballs won those balls have balls
It's good that y'all applied bulletproof glass like Plexiglass for the huge blender. It better not be the brand y'all applied to attempt to shatter it at the "Leaning Tower of Perth", a place that's part of the Gravity Centre.
Intrusive thought put someone in there. I hate intrusive thoughts so I'm sharing my cursed idea😅
Make the blades sharper⚔️
How the fck I'm enjoying this so much?!!
We NEEEEEED the SloMoGuys in on this one
This is so cool 🆒🆒🆒🆒🆒🆒🆒🆒🆒🆒🆒🆒🆒🆒🆒🆒🆒🆒🆒🆒
what is the HP of the motor in that thing?
i feel like this would be in a saw movie, and HR would say "would like to play a game?"
Amazingly done ✔️
Gaunson, the "h" in psycho is a hard one to remember. Don't beat yourself up, it's hard to memorize everything about spelling.
Was that an explosion from Mythbusters at 2:46?
E-Stop not working is very dangerous
Is there a world record smoothly vid coming soon?
PSiYChO
I greatly feel some surfing legends spirit was with you this day 🤙
Maybe time to step it up to a bomb shelter guys. I feel like you were seconds away from having those blades rip through the shipping container.....hearing that machine find a new level was terrifying.
I pooped a bit.
@4:57 it sounds like someone going super Saiyan
They should of teamed up with PewdiePie and put him in the blender.
On the one hand, this was an epic video. On the other, I do think you need to upgrade your safety procedures when working with this kind of heavy machinery. You seem to be in need of a few more failsafes!
u bought the blenders from anko?
I have seen far bigger blenders than this, what a joke.
"Will It Blend? King-size Edition"
Put in 100 cat toys
a pressure washer would have been godd for this experiment XD to clean up inbetween the smashes XD   on a sidenote, this is frreakkin the coolest thing ive ever seen xD hahahaha
I read the comments first then saw them standing inside with blades and couldn’t warm them
Demon core screwdriver level of anxiety on that e-break blokes
Major Chernobyl vibes at 15:22.
E-Stop not working is horrific
44
This is one of the greatest things I've ever seen on the internet.
Scott's last wisdom would have been about English language. Scary stuff
what are the odds the surf board surfed the blades
Bring that thing to California. We could televise criminals being dropped in it. If that doesn't do the trick, god help us!
Kind of scary that the blender refused to stop even even to the emergency stop button.... How did you shut it off.... Pull the plug
..... And you scared people whit arachnophobia whit a spider
JUSTICE FOR THE GODDAMN SPIDER!!!
Wow, the surfboard had buoyancy against the blender blades. Can you imagine riding that? I wonder if this channel gives anyone nightmares.
Blend elephant toothpaste!
love the build, I remember a large blender built in 90s in california, they served free smooothies, once at a park Im not sure why its not recorded somewhere
had to prime those generators again
I’m sure you fellas are taking reasonable safety precautions but I don’t think you should ever stand inside the blender.  Ask yourself this, do you want to ensure there is a 100% chance of you ever being blender in a giant blender?  If the answer is Yes, you don’t want to be standing in a blender, even if you think it’s unplugged.  I suggest treating it like a gun and assuming that it’s always loaded.  Anyway, back to blending things.
Do Bouncy Balls!!!! or Orbeez!
We watch this in school today and when our teacher put this video on my first thought was “NO,NO,NO” and my freind is like “TIME TO PUT THE LARGEST CAT IN THERE” 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭(I’m yr 6 so everyone went crazy abt this vide-
This would not happen with Siemens Safety :)
Hope y'all do a thorough safety systems review/redesign before turning this thing back on again. That's a huge motor in that thing and you do not want something like that catching fire. Stay safe out there.
“Do not pass go” bit was the best🤣
Excuse me, gentlemen, we're 5 days overdue for a new video 😂
E stop didn't work that's the craziest dangerous thing that has happened on your channel  your best vid ever glad  Your safe stay safe
7:25 nothing like blasting freon into the atmosphere
I live in Perth you guys rock 🪨 🎸 😎 can you guys blend a car please 😊😊 and soooooo funny😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This video was crazy can't wait for the next one
Thanks for getting me through the dreaded man flu boys, I've just watched loads of your vids with much enjoyment... keep them coming....
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 stop pls😭
outch
😭😿😢
I LOVE THIS TV
The cartels would most definitely buy that from you guys.
we need a slowies only video. gimme only the slowies. asmr bro!
Slow motion
The answer to, “Will it blend?”, has never been more proudly answered 😂
I would have used those golf balls 😂😂
lol you guys are mental and I love it!!!
Girls at sleep overs - OMG lets dye our hair 🤭 hehehe  Boys at sleep overs : …
Who else thought it was gonna explode
PShYChO  T U R B O
Can we get another air bag vid for the 44ers
I think I saw one shoot out of the blender😮😮😮
Imagine if you fell in that 😂😂😂😂😂
While this is sick. The fact estop didnt work and you have to physically get in the machine to load and clean. Makes me very nervous and sick in the gut.
I genuinely thought the blender was going to blow up or catch on fire 😮
Part 2? When?
Well done lads, well done!
Let me start by saying that I've watched almost all of your videos. I have to tell you that this one was one of the most entertaining   Lol
this is crazy even for them
I've been watching you all for a min because my son loves you guys. This is one of the first times I saw actual fear in your eyes.
Noooooo the golf balls 😢😢😢😢
This world it’s fkt….
Who wants a Cookie 🍪
15:42 like Chernobyle
Don't breath that.
golf ball dust - don't breathe this!
I'm so glad we've arrived at this stage of the internet. What a time to be alive.
Love the vids as always boys, thank you for bringing so much joy to the world! That said I think it’s time for an Steel version of Rexy so he can get some revenge after all these years! Cheers HR Team!
You guys are stepping it up video after video
They pressed AZ-5
That surfboard went out with one final shred🤘🏽
wow the amount of cats that could be blended at once
put a whole cow on it plssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
You should make a giant arrow
“Lord, if this is my time, I’m sorry for possibly killing one of your spiders and wasting a load of stuff that could have gone to people who needed it. But see you soon.”
here's your challenge, an entire episode on "Soccer" balls Congratulations to the "MATILDA'S"
blend a car!!!
very chaotic and detailed in there, thx alot
I am terrified to say the least
Well think we know the estop wasn't wired up correctly.  What you saw was a VFD malfuction, what it does when it looses communcation with what ever is controlling it. They where pushing it too hard. (hence why it kept tripping out.)  It probably experianced a voltage drop under high load which then caused a loss of communication to the communcating computer/controller.  If the e-stop is on the comminucation side, It will not work if communication to the drive is lost ( as you saw in the video)  If the e-stop is connected to a 3 phase contactor  on INPUT on the VFD/VSD then regardles sof loss of communcation, the e-stop will CUT power to the drive.  IT will not do so if the stop is on the controlling/commincation sid eof things. (Which I asumme is the case. And as you saw, the thing began to speed up too (Another result of the loss of communaction from the computer/controller the VFD/VSD is conmnected too. Kinda curious how big a drive they are running, on that motor.
I flashed straight to Chernobyl, when the 'shut everything down' button just made everything blow up instead!!
These guys tying to understand English makes me laugh too hard
What if you put Oobleck in the blender.
15:57 😅
”Will it blend? That is the question”
Blending stuff!!!
I'm just coming to the realization that we are incredibly lucky the HR team aren't super villains, cause they definitely have a selection of super villain tools 😂
So close to 10b views total! Lets goooooo!
This might be the funniest video you've ever made! Well done, mates!
I promise you that on one of the last, if not THE last helicopter video, I commented that it was giving me 'Will It Blend' vibes, and of course I looked up the good 'ol 'Willitblend' dott comm videos and realized there were some 'demonstrations' I'd never seen!!!
How ridiculous
Did you notice the tornado in there at the end ? Damn
Can you put the person that put that cat in the blender in there
This is amazing! I think it’s my new favourite series. The destruction is magnificent!!
love the banter on the clock face 😂😂
That ending was definitely a huge code brown moment. But great video guys. Glad no one was hurt.
Imagine if they had this in the medieval times
The things these guys have made in a amazing!
The things these guys have made in a amazing!
I hope u guys don't have a channel in the dark web where u put other living stuff inside
10:00 blend it
Gaunson tried so hard to spell psycho 😂😂 you could see his brain working and he still failed
“If there’s one thing you don’t put in your blender it’s a bowling ball” 😂😂😂 im gonna start finding (probably barely related) situations to use this in
You should blend ballistics gel in the shape of a person.
This looks like something someone would use in a horror movie!
whenever I’m sad I just watch an hr video, cheers me right up, keep up the great work guys ❤❤
Best episode ever boys!!!!!!!! e-stop for the win!!!!!!!!!!!
The golf balls look like popcorn 🍿
Make a shirt that says Rexy rocks!
Make more merch and I’ll buy it
Let’s bring back “We’ll pin ya!” can’t we?
Have you guys ever featured Tim Tams yet?
Splatoon 2 Octo Expansion Lookin Blender bro
😂😂 why are they ducking inside the container?!
I hope y'all captured the refrigerant or it was trash prior to this.
I’d love to see a separate YouTube channel of them making these cool machines
You should try ferocerium rods.
"the one thing you never want to put into your blender is a bowling ball" might be a brand new sentence 😂😂😂
Boys will be boys 😂 and this is for the boys
Do rubber duckies next lol! The amount of squeaks it'll make lol!
Commenting for the YouTube algorithm
What ever happened to Kyle Nebel
This is one of the scariest things that i've ever see, no shit
Awesome ! Needs a Spinal Tap 11 on the dial.
hahahaha nyc panicmodes!!
This video is why the internet was invented! (Put in an old bank safe next.)
please this thing was give for me why you are crish this pleas gibe me
You should put in 100 lynx deodorant cans
You should blend a ballistic tummy torso!
Nó to vãi
There's a bit of haptic feedback
Slow Mo Guys should get a collab with Blendie!🎉
Bros just almost ended the entire world
I think either the blender got to excited or just went full PSIYChO
👎👎👎👎
The cows in the background when the golf clubs went in jumped out of their skins.
I am SOOOOO glad u guys are ok 😬
So why would it be a “Psyco” setting and not “Ridiculous”?
I love it do another one
put a cat in it
You need a 480vac VFD
Put it all in jars and sell it like whistlindiesel!
This has GOT to be the coolest gadget you lunatics have ever made! 🤣
We have multiple fail-safe mechanisms Few moments later: E-Stop doesn't work!!!!
you guys r nuts
fridg is dead
Try and blend a safe!!
Per the original meme, will it blend…..iPhones
Throw in a pig
Good video. Still, never seen guys more in need of a LOTO in my life.
You guys would absolutely fit in if you went to florida
Крутой канал, очень интересно смотреть. 👍
Will it blend, that is the question
Perfect dude
Wonder what motor it has?
"well that's not in one piece anymore" will forever be iconic 😂
Can you try and put some water in it and turn it on?
E-stops ALWAYS need to be physical power cut off switches. Not software based. I'm glad nobody was hurt.
Wow, he looks great. the cancer cant keep down his spirit!!
next time do a fridge full of soda
Excitied for part 2!
I could of swore I heard something about multiple fail safes in the beginning but none could be implemented at the end when it went off on its own 😂😂😂 just unplug it and plug it back in again it will be fine😂😂
And it frickin blend’s fridges 😂😂 WTF🤯🤯🤯
Dean the fabricator built something even he didn’t think would survive and it handled better than any body expected lol I thought for sure that was the end of it😂😂
Love you guys... that was fun! ❤ looking forward to part 2
Tennis Balls remind me of the old style Lottery drawings with the way they're flying all over inside. EDIT: I take it back. The GOLF BALLS are the lottery ball...
....... Who wired up the EMERGENCY Stop button???????????
Lots of fail safes, except a functioning emergency stop.  Thankfully all was okay!!!
These cows are gonna be chewing on nuts and bolts for generations.
"Error 56 happened" comedic timing perfection
Best video in a while...but all are great!
❣️❣️❣️ Better YET!- Fill it with pond water, add a few dozen big Coi Fish and 30-50 house cats 🐱 🐈 ❣️👍🏼👍🏼
Never thought I’d say this but, I’d say it was safer throwing stuff off the tower and the dam lol 😂 My son and I were super nervous for you for a second lol
Fellas!-    Duh!= put a GoPro in a ‘clear hamster ball’ in with EVERY BATCH!-  maybe even a batch of 20-100 GoPros?!?!?!!   $$$$$
Upside down lawn mower to look like a blender, boring... Maybe if you had more blender like blades and it was off set like a legit good blender doesn't have the blade perfectly center... Disappointed boys, as over the top as you normally are to produce such a basic basic blender looking lawnmower
easily the best thing you guys have ever built!
Will it blend on steroids
You guys should drop an ballistic dummy in there
That’s what happens when you set it to PSiYCHO mode
I guess they’ve never heard of stored energy
🧍 Domy 🥏 man 🧍›🥏plz
Will It Blend™ 2023
Massive respect to the surfboard. It tried to ride the blades till the very end LOL
you need to use a "seal in curcuit" to compliment your e-stop,
You guys need to get the "Will it blend" guy
1:14 kinda sounded like pressing 1000 keys per second💀
let’s go
Them golf balls looked a $1 billion powerball
I was looking for videos for learning about Blender, the 3D software... I suppose this is procrastination?
Golf balls? Why golf balls? Make the world's biggest shake.
Wow best yet LoL
Um, 44 club?
Psycho 😂😂😂😂
Only Australians would flick a spider like its a fly
There's no end to all the fun you can have when you have a bloody big electric motor. Keep'em coming boys!
Have you guys heard of lock out, tag out? I wouldn't get in that blender until there are like, 2 locks or more on the power supply. People in professional factories have been cooked in industrial ovens, I don't wanna see one of you lot breaking their legs in a blender. You mention multiple fail safes, but only talk about disconnecting the main power supply.  And then your emergency stop 1 doesn't work XD
Throw the tungstoncube in there xD
the VSC overheated so the motor got full unlimited power from the generator i think, thats why it started going faster and then the motor started to over heat and started smoking
How Good!! The boys are back 😊
Dear How Ridiculous, I have enjoyed this video entertainment and would like to request further like content.  Thank you for reading my comment, have a good day.  Regards, Me
Get a big rexy and drop him on rexy 🤯
Absolutely no way I’d stand inside the blender even with it “powered off”
Madness!!
3:16 Gallagher would be proud
Duuuude the surf board surfed the blades 😳😎
you should try 1 tennis ball in a normal blender
Where’s the lock out tag out
Blendtec did it best. But this was good
The sound of the blender starting up sounds like the beginning of a horror movie. Creepy.
That's what snoop dog uses to chop up his weed
Should have dropped a bale of hay inside the blender
Blender was dope, but I wouldn’t be disappointed if this was its only video! ❤
This is the most absolute redneck thing I have ever seen, and I’m a natural born redneck…good on ya, and get er done!
Put the guy who blended the cat in there
Crazyyyyy when the E-Stop wouldn't work! Glad you guys and the team are safe! God bless!
Should make it so the blade sits on a steel beam running across the floor, then both sections of the floor could be made into release hatches so you can open one or both at a time to dump whatever's in the blender out the bottom
Turn it to 11
How ridiculous needs to buy a 20 acre property for all the big inventions. Axe hammer blender
Will It Blend: The Next Generation  These are the voyages of the Blendtec Enterprise.  The continuing mission to explore strange, new smoothies.  To seek out new powders and smokes, dont breathe this.  To boldly go where no blender has gone before.
Imagine falling in THAT thing... 😅😅
You guys gotta put a ballistics dummy in there one day
We watch these videos at school XD
Man that propeller motor got a lot of use on this channel
its the rope stopping it
Quite possibly the most magnificent content they've ever made.
Oh my god 😮
cant wait for more psiycho 'will it blend' videos
whoever is reading this comment I double dog dare you to blend yourself in the giant blender
Great episode!
Daisy the cow thought it was her time
Now finally you've gone truly ridiculous.  Good job boys
Nice power surge at the end
dead pig is a go-for to a human alternative it is also a go-to for scientific destructive science to alternate test human tissue. aka dead pig in a huge blender!!!!!!
Never have I ever thought I'd see a refrigerator get blended
If you want honor… give honor.
Water proof it and make the worlds largest margarita
5:19 Whacka Whacka Whacka Whacka! :P
They almost caused a residence cascade with golf balls
It means it's all for show, and you shouldn't be allowed to do it again
it’s just them watching their money rip to pieces
How Ridiculous what that!!!!
How much did it cost to build that thing?
Lock out, tag out bois.
Rip headphone users
Brenda the blender
You guys are just totaly insane..... keep on going, I like that
this is ultra slow mo would be awesome
Congrats, boys, you've created a portal!🌀
One ginormous smoothie coming right up!
I think out of everything you guys have created this is definitely the most RIDICULOUS lol.
you guys have lost your minds!!!          loved it!!!
Ooooh…a cliffgangah (in my best Aussie accent…which leaves a lot to be desired)!
I hope the fridge was de-gassed before you blended it.
Behold HOW GOOD and how pleasant it is for brethren to  dwell in unity! Psalm 133:1
"o naaoooooooo",   "naöööö"
It's like a Simpson's Halloween special that came to life!! 😫😫😫🤣🤣😂🤣😂
This the the Most RIDICULOUS thing you guys have Ever done!!! Good Job.
You guys actually fu***d up the area
I felt nervous and on edge just listening to the katanas spinning. When the e-stop didn't work, I was genuinely worried. Glad you are all right. Keep up the great work and stay safe.
How Ridiculous has officially entered the next level💪 well done boys!! That’s a wicked machine 👌
This is the best episode of will it blend I have ever seen😳
that weird helicopter propellers of death
I THINK YOU SHOULD PUT A CAR IN THE BLENDER
"It is surfing!"
Can we plz have the 14 pallet skip bullseyes. I know we didn’t meet the goal but we NEED to revive the bulleyes playlist
as an Aussie these guys are the best Mate they have the best accent, slang and mate AUSSIE KICK
spuder
WOATAH
crazy never seen something that big
PSIYCHO Wow
Didn’t think the fridge would blend I thought it would be too heavy so the blades wouldn’t spin
Morrrrr blender
You're gonna need some carbide edges on that blade set.
The blades CNC’ed? How are they spinning so true?
The E-Stop not working is the equivalent of your safe word being ignored in the bedroom
Should have teamed up with "will it blend"
nice ace ventura cameo
Still ain’t got shit on my blendtec blender
u guys are fking oaths to our great country!🇦🇺🇦🇺
What do you do with all the stuff you destroy?
We need more blender.
As an American who also worked in a theme park as a kid. E stop not working is music to my ears.
What the dads do when the wife and kids go on vacation. Lmao. Amazing video guys
Next thing to put in that chamber: a few corrput politicians
These lads are gonna have smile lines as deep as the grand canyon.  Good for them. 🤘🏻💜🩵🩷
Man, you dudes can spot a spider from a ways off.
“Will it blend?  That is the question”
I feel like this is big enough to blend the whole @blendtechwillitblend channel.
I'm assuming you used rs485 to control the VFD, if your e-stop depends on that connection, you did it wrong. Wire in a physical disconnect switch to power...
Totally  A W E S O M E  !  !  !
Should do bouncy balls instead of golf balls. Would have probably been epic
you should answer your action's one day. i'm so sorry about that
You guys would have a run away blender.  It reminded me of the toaster in Ghostbusters 2.  Speaking of evil ooze, have you thought about putting ooblek into the blender?
And?
My five year old said "do not put Rexy in there!" 🤣
Is this project sponsored by BlendTec? 😉
ROCKET ASSISTED AXE OR GUILLOTINE!
Runaway motors are scary as hell!! Glad nothing catastrophic happened though!!
What if u fill it with water and different color golf balls. The colorful vortex it could make
So satisfying!  Great job boys!
"The e-stop didn't stop it.. The e-stop has to stop it.." Was perhaps the most harrowing workplace sentence ever spoken... Somebody dicked up here boys..
Make the worlds largest smoothie
What was the name on the bowling balls . I am interested in the blue one with a yellow hammer logo
Great for body disposal....yup, I'm THAT guy.
This is the well it blend series!!! Lol😂
Ok who builds your stuff I am absolutely surprised that the boring ball and fridge didn't break anything 😂😂😂😂😂 whoever it is needs to build safe houses
New T shirt. Giant blender out of control smoking: "Error 56 happened"
At 1 minute in you dropped a marshmallow in wood chipper. “👏👏👏” ‘ DEE dee Dee’…
In 2 weeks? 😢
The slow mows in this will be amazing
U could have given me that fridge I regrets
You have only one place to go from here worlds largest margarita 👍 I'd love to join for that one
Top 3 vids of all time....EPIC
Imagine the amount of cats!!
Where is the asian that blended the cat? We got something for him!
E-Stop = AZ5☢️😁
If they find what caused the issue, it would be freakin awesome if they uploaded a side video explaining what happened. I would love to know and im sure plenty others would too. Also judging by the smoke in the generator, it seems like the motor lost control and drew so much power the generator couldn't handle it. Great vid tho guys!  Edit: spelling
Freaking awesome mates.
When these guys are scared you know stuff went sideways
This is the best invention you guys have made. I wish there was more slowie footage
But did it blend?
What about 5,000 litres of Ooblek????
Amagon putting a human in to this
AHHHHHHH!!!!! YoU!... FLicKed JeFf!!!!
Some tvs have stuff in them you are not supposed to breathe invand I know you don't want to breathe in refrigerant rom that fridge.
Do a special night one and put tons of glow sticks and glow stuff. That would be cool. Greetings from Texas.
The morality police of Saudi Arabia said they'd like to have access to this blender for unspecified reasons. 😢
I can see where you went wrong, you're clearly using the software for the Batcopter and not for the Blender.... I think this may void your warranty!🙂😀
I'm one minute in and already hoping they blend an African elephant.
Ik dagt dat je mr beast was 😂
TBH, if I keep getting Ads on Youtube (which I pay for) to Sub your Member Channel, yall might lose my Sub.
YES YES YES
Next time please overscale your safety solutions. Your power run to the motor controller looked way too thin... I wouldn't be surprised if your e-stop didn't work because the way-too-high current just welded the estop relay shut in the closed position
RIP ear bud users' ears
*Why do people freak out over smoke, sparks or fire? I have been in the destroying stuff game for decades. Almost nothing bothers me. When stuff starts melting and burning in a white arc, I've done my job.*
I think the blade is stopping because of the string that's attached to the objects!
Is that a motor from a helicopter?
The surfboard... rip. It kept surfing til the very end.
I can't believe the the polycarbonate withstood the impacts!
@14:50 🫨
I really hope for your guy's safety you remove the refrigerant from the refrigerator. That's some highly nasty dangerous stuff.
In the states we call them VFD. Variable frequency drive. Same difference.
This remind me of Jeremy Clarkson V8 blender
I bet you won't stand in that anymore after the e stop malfunction.
"English with Gaunson" needs to be a new segment after this beauty
The GoPro on top has seen God
Larga um boneco realístico com pele e ossos pra simular um corpo humano
Hope you not gonna blend some of them cows lol
Turn it up to 12!
Mr
Hey did you know me beast watching you video
my mom says it agervates her to know that some people don't have the stuff your wasting
This video is sickaf, but you guys should do a pt. 2!!
Good soup 👍🏼
I hope in part two you LOTO if you go back inside the thing. It's foolish to say it can't turn on if there isn't  a way to insure it won't be plugged in...just saying.
🎉🎉🎉🎉 13:27
Gotta do a giant ice cube then have snow cones after
Hopefully part 2 has mannequins and spray paint (saved for the end to be able to see through the polycarb, of course)
You guys have really outdone yourselves with this! I appreciate that you pointed out safety measures that you are using, and I think it is good to show the failures... It's a learning experience along with the ridiculous entertainment. I love the blender, but stay safe!
A+ boys. I gave you a thumbs up as soon as Brett gave us all the lowkey safety briefing to put us as a viewer at ease, but honestly that ending was insanely entertaining. Please do not take that as me asking for you to risk it for the biscuit, but seriously this was such a funny video. Thanks for including lots of BTS at the end too. On the edge of my seat for part 2 now...
I hate that you guys trash this stuff that could be properly recycled, but...damn is it ever cool to watch in slow motion.
Tge tennis balls looked very cool
Good grief, how powerful is that motor? :)
This has to be the best destructive contraption you guys have ever had built!
Editing was spot on this time. Well done mr editor.
do a big load of sand in it
@Blendtec you have some competition
What if you make the worlds largest smoothie from the worlds largest blender and then start a smoothie stand in a very public area where you sell & entertain customers & you demonstrate how they were made.  Oh, you could also give people free smoothies. ——— Also, use diffrent items than just technical, Thick & Hard machiene objects.  What about piñatas?  Or water ballons?  Or food coloring?  Or even bombs?!? That are somehow safe?!?!? BATH BOMBS  What if you hire the worlds best cook or smoothie maker & have them make a smoothie or drink for the worlds most giant animal at the zoo?  Yoyot justin,  What if you combine coke or soda? What if you mix a bunch of candy and make a candy drink?  What if you mix in slime?!?  What if you made the blender somehow waterproof and managed to make a Pool or something using what you mixed inside the blender?!?  What if u guys team up with mark rober to throw the most epic event or extreme collaberation for content? Like you two team up to sell smoothies, or tv scraps, or take requests for what you should throw into the blender,  What if you try to make drinks out of vegetables? Like corn… id you blend it enough maybe you can drink it?  What if u team up with mark rober to make a machiene that actullay combats the blender. Drone Vs Blender, and the drone is carrying a heavy object and it has only a certain amount of time to survive the blender, if it ends up falling into the blender it looses.  What about explosions or sand? Or cereal?  What if u made sand or some ground using that cereal?  Elephant toothpaste in blender?!? Requests from the comments?  How about a disco ball or somthing glamerous that looks rlly rlly shiney when blended together and makes somthing rlly satisfying.  What if u modified the big blender and actullay make it bump items up & down on multiple sides of it while blending it?  A bouncy blender where movement is constant not only at the blades…  Moving blender… Machiene blender… Diffrent types of blades… spike traps…  Blades being able to go UP & DOWN.  Doubling as a simple cutter than  blender.  Flying blender… train… CRUSHER…  Air Compressor and a blender combined.   So an air compactor & a Blender blade where things not only get satisfyingly crushed by satisfyjngly cut  Chain chomps and piranan plants  Plants…  Feeding animals  Creating a pool of animal food for the animals
Make the worlds largest fruit smoothie in the blender
Dang. You guys have built so many machines; I started watching like 5 years ago and am always impressed by your innovation. I thought for sure one day I’d be seeing scott jump off the tower onto a trampoline or one of those big air cushions to launch the  Herran into space 🤖
Will it blend? That was the question.
HR recycling services now open for business... 😂 Awesome video. Made everyone's heart pound at the end there 😮
Y’all should do something at the water where the dam is.
"Subscribe for Part 2" ........Oh great...... I actually wanted to know how it goes on. Only those who don't want to or can't register are now left out. With that you have collected negative points with me......😒
no WAY LOLL
Absolutely love your guys energy. Makes my day every viddy
What happened to Kyle Nebel?
Welcome to an episode of “will it blend?”
How to disabled Helicopter....Confirmed......Golf Balls, who knew
Did someone say rubber band ball vs blender?
Make a giant margarita and some salsa
8:32 : Mohamed henni sweaty
PUT SPRAYPAINT IN!!!!
please tell me you fixed the estop before starting that thing up again.
When you start talking about the safety, but E-Stop doesn't work haha
8:02 TV strikes back.
Best machine yet !!
Oh gods, just had a horrible thought, your "e-stop" wasn't software based, was it?? PLEASE tell me it wasn't software-based! You gotta have a physical power disconnection!
Ces sont vraiment des hommes avec la joie de vivre <3
TURBO!
This is friggin' awesome, but PLEASE don't do any more until you know why the E-stop didn't work! Like, if that can happen, then your e-stop isn't an e-stop. And maybe move the point where you physically detach the power cable so it's in reach of the bunker, so you can safely kill power that way if needed?
Dude. Terrifying
Is anyone else with tinnitus infuriated by the start up sound
E-stop more like NO-stop
But the E Stop has to stop it! Spooky lol
I think next is a giant microwave
you should buy whole pig from butcher shop and throw it in :D
Engineer here, I do a lot of work looking at water pumping stations. These have VFDs and similar power rated motors. I mainly look at the hydraulic side of things but the control systems sometimes come into this. There is no way this was correctly setup. In an application like this the E-Stop should be hard wired in to operate a contactor either feeding power into the whole system (between generator and blender) or between the panel and the motor. On a rig like this there is no reason for the E-stop not to just cut power. What it looks like here is the E-Stop was an input into the control system. To me what appears to have happened was that the E-Stop turned off the VFD not the motor, this then caused the motor to acelerate up to sycronous speed. The "burning clutch" smell was most likely the drive belt which presumably was not rated for that speed/load. What's more worrying is that after all this happened you guys appeared to just turn it on again and once it started spinning take that as proof of everything being okay. Please take some proper precautions with this thing before you end up with Darwin Awards.
how strong is the metal
You've combined "Will It Blend" and "How Ridiculous" into one of the best things I've seen in years. Keep it up guys!
Just when we thought this  channel  couldn't get any more bonkers, you came up with this insanity! Well played, boys !
A large tarp under you giant messes will help clean up, they even make the nice ones with fold up sides to trap everything including liquids
“We do look out for our safety.”  *blends a fridge*
10:22 yeah cuz Gaunson ruined the illusion early in the video by saying it did nothing.
anyone else hear the start up of the intro to GTA San Andreas whenever they turn the blades on lol
This video’s for the boys 💪🏽💪🏽
Blending electronics is super dangerous. beryllium oxide poisoning is just one thing you can get very easily breathing in side dust.
Those cows are not phased.
Will it blend?
Can you add a pulse and other blender functions? Make it a real blender
No nod to the 44 club?? Y’all are slippin 😂
Should have put one of those cows in the blender
Changed my life I will never consider suicide again ❤❤❤
I think it’s the first time I see the guys genuinely frightened by their creation 🤣
“We have multiple safeties.”   *shows one safety* 😂😂
Manmade horror beyond comprehension
blended cow for a finale? lol jk
everybody on this channel needs to lay off the nose candy
The cow at 10:38 like "the hell are they doing over there?"
Yep....that was Ridiculous.   Haha.  Anvil, Fist, Wrecking Ball, Trampoline,  Rexi, Giant Dart,....and then came the Blender.  Cant wait to see whats next.  Thanks for giving us something to watch while Cable TV is on holiday.  You guys are a blessing.
Is it a diesel generator by any chance?
10:02 Did it live?!
I was genuinely getting scared there!  Glad you all are ok.
Props to whoever’s idea it was to make a giant blender because this vid was absolutely incredible.   Also, when a giant machine with blades overheats and the EMERGENCY STOP DOESN’T STOP IT… I’d be freaking out too😅
No intro?
The cartels might use this idea as a scare tactic
Roughly one minute into the video and I already HEARTILY endorse this new direction. BLEND EVERYTHING.
The cows scared shitless they think they next they mad looking at it like hell naw I’m outta here 💀💀😭😭😭
how did the blender just break and start smoking.and also how did it run without electricity
Imagine this was quite a eureka moment for you boys
Them on a cow farm got me 💀
You guys covered the airflow 😂
Will it blend?    Don’t breath this!
You need to collab with the slowmo guys for this
Nuts lmfao
wowie!!! a 10 iron?
Personal isolation locks maybe? Can’t rely on just unplugging it’s these days
Please get the blend tec guy to come do this with you
12:39
"Blender smoke👨‍🦳 don't breath this
octo expansion lore
that end was NERVE RACKING
A whole new twist on the question, “will it blend?” . PLEASE put in a fully sized ballistics gel human.
Now I think this is scripted because of the editing with the writing PSYChO and TURBO not being there, I don't know. Maybe I'm just crazy
The panels should be Lexan..   It wont crack, it just deforms.
"LOOK AT THA BLENDAAAAAAAA"😂😂
So glad it all worked out with the e-stop fail. Can't wait for part 2!
Idea, GIANT TOASTER (literally launches things in the air)
thank you so much for your great videos . being a quadriplegic I enjoy watching you guys having fun.
10:35 The cows just turn around little and look, they don't run away like shot from a cannon as you might expect. Nah, they are just used to the shenanigans is my guess.
You guys have got to make the world's biggest smoothie
You need another channel to show us how these contraptions are built.
Why does godson look like he's been in the bikey ice?
Please dont ever stop destroying stuff.
The tennis ball “do not pass go, do not collect 2 hundred dollars” got me weak 😂😂
IM FAT AF I WAS WAITING FOR FOOD TO GO IN 😑
I love how we don't mention what sounds like one of them making a muffled "HELP" noise at the start, but turns out to be live stock. Did everyone forget about that?
I was thinking you should pour the golf balls in while the blender is running but then I realized you would have golf balls shooting back out the top so yeah never mind…
Once the magic smokes leaves it’s a goner
Tennis balls was my favorite
**Hank J. Wimbleton would like to know your location.**
May I suggest mounting Lexan on both ends of the frame of the blender
Of all the things you lads have come up with, this has got to be the most ridiculously dangerous....and I absolutely love it!!
after watching him kill that beautiful spider , i don't think i will watch this channel any more .i like spiders.
It was like watching Chernobyl all over again
This is stupendous
Thank god for redundancy. first, second third e-stop.... axe to the cord if that dont work.
👍👍
Boys, this was LOADS OF FUN!!  I cannot wait til part 2! Genuinely enjoyed every second and I was scared with you at the end.  The whole fiasco with the e stop not working felt like something that would happen to my friends and I which made it even more exciting. you guys are the definition of friendship 44 forever!
Blend a giant rubber band ball. 😊
How ridiculous,
The moment E-Stop is not working, you are like Ralphie. "Haha, I am in danger."
"Don't breathe this"
how ridiculous once again creating more plastic landfill than a small country
I didn't send the link to this video at first. I just asked my friend what he figured would happen if you put a refrigerator into a blender. His answer: Cold cuts.
Dude, y'all need to create the world's largest smoothie.
I was going to consider subscribing until I saw him flick the spider like it was a meaningless piece of trash. You have to learn to be friendly to all animals whether they’re great or small to the best of your ability. It would be one thing if it was a very dangerous spider in your house, and, sometimes it’s just not possible to catch them to put them outside and if it’s something really dangerous then sometimes OK you need to hit it as soon as possible before it runs under a crevice and then comes out later to eat your face. Otherwise you need to learn to be nice to animals. Just because it’s small it doesn’t mean it’s life is meaningless. You’re definitely going to get a thumbs down for that.
An udea for you 3.   Bring extra side sheets. You are guaranteed to break more. Bring back ups.
Have you giys considered a collab with colin furze... getting similar energy from these channels
This is the best thing you guys have ever done
Imagine this being a torture device for humans!
Nice bro .cool man .
Yeah, any time you hear “the E-Stop wont turn it off” is when you see any shophand duck and cover or run for the 9 hells because they know that someone or something is about to meet its maker.
Worlds largest smoothie
The previous owner of golf clubs, "If I hit ONE more slice..."
Anyone else think what I thought when they showed the cow?
BEST CONTENT EVER!!!
Cow: “This is a bad idea, guys! Hey! Guys?!”
Put a cat in
More like Emergency-Speed up geeez
11:44 it would take 167 minutes
I always wanted to ask how do you guys clean all that stuff up when something gets shredded or blown to bits? Do you have a clean up crew?
the results were everything I could've hoped for. I didn't expect it to be this epic, but oh boy was this epic.
you guys really need to join up with the slo mo guys for some of these videos !!!! and also be kind to animals...what you did to that spider was not cool at all !!!!
Put a whole cow in there.
I never user get used to someone say "Heych"
Have to drop the balls too much clogging when they are already in there
Next is the biggest saw
By far the best "Giant tool" yet!
But will it Blend? That is the qestion3
"don't breath this"
Put a ballistic dummy in there. You know the head and shoulders and that (green blood to make it YouTube friendly)
Will it blend that is the question
☠️☠️☠️
Surfboard smoke....don't breath this
I think the red and green buttons are just props..
Make the world largest lemonade pleaaasssaaasasaaassaaaassaasadassassa
Will it blend is back, yeah!  Don’t breath this!
Best video ever!!! And ive been watching you guys since the original drop tests.
But the cow it-bona
Maybe they should build the world's largest microwave next and microwave a microwave.
I didn't buy a blender WITH THE MONEY
The Aliens are so confused right now.
You should’ve put a switch on the door, that once the door is open, it cuts the power to the blender.
ALL THAT OCEAN CLEANUP FOR NOTHING🤦‍♂️
i wonder if u put a bad guy in there
This might be your best idea yet
Imagine if a serial killer got ahold of this…
Doesn't occur to any of them to simply unplug it.
9:57 average Australia moment
G'day guys I've watched and really enjoyed all your videos for a few years. I in a fight with lung cancer and would love to see you do some things over  on the  Gold Coast so I could meet you to say thanks for the years of fun. ✌️ ❤️
Gnarliest surf ever!
bring out the cats
what? ....oh.  yeah this is mental!😂😂
Waiting for another splatter shirt video.
I'm 59, am I allowed to be in the 44 club. I watch everything you do. I have Rexy and pingpong balls.
@blendtec
This is fcuking GRRREAT!!! 😂🤣😂🤣
1:04 I love the surprise in the "It's still going!" Most of the stuff they do is a blink-and-you-miss-it kind of thing, so to have something that is self contained and just keeps going until you stop it must be quite the change for them.  It's also terrifying and feels like they're trying to win a Darwin Award or something.
Is it bad of me to want to see what would happen eith a human 😅  Edit Scrstch that, a few humans 😂😂😂
I love you guys and the channel but please don’t endanger yourself into another video if you can’t fix your E-stop issue
Falling in would be....horrible 😊
Get the guy from “will it blend” on here please
This is an epic machine dudes! I pure laughed out loud several times. Glad you're all safe. Maybe some fresh pants for next time though.
It's always so strange to see you guys in warm clothing when it's the middle of the summer here in Texas USA. I know it's yalls winter but it's 112°F outside where I am right now...... Funniest thing, I went to convert to °C since yall don't use °F and it's 44.4° C outside today. Hahahaha! Perfect!
Next time: 1000 eggs… 😂🙈
"Definitely something happened."- Captain Obvious
Will it blend?
the surfbard surfing was awesome
This was an amazing concept!
That blender is a goner
The panicked "we can't stop it" felt like a movie scene, never seen anything go wrong in the vids and I can't say i wasn't on the edge of my seat because i definitely was
as a man of culture I appreciate the ace ventura reference 🤌
Fracking amazing 😍🤩
I hope you guys took the refrigerant out of the fridge, that stuff can be really toxic and harmful to the environment.
Don’t breath this!
that's better than I expected so better like my childhood dream
Do you not think blade sheaths for when you’re stepping about inside may be a good idea?  If you’re manoeuvring something heavy about in there and you had something wet in there before, you may end up being a middle stump short of a gentleman.
This was one of the best ideas on the channel yet, hands down
I could literally watch these guys blend random shit for hours
really pleasant to watch. But I did miss a bit of colour for the slowy. Either the fridge or the barrel should be filled up with spray paint cans to see them slowly blooming to a blended beautiful death
You gotta put a little water in it.
Why is no one talking about the cow loll
2:17 Ahahahahaha… Wipeout!
Works realy well😂
This video had so many MOMENTS but when the blender wouldn’t stop and it was just genuine fear in their eyes was insane , I was scared 😱
pure madness
Environmental hazard Micro plastics
them boys are bonkers
That motor is crazy😮
I love the How Ridiculous Rexy Jurassic Park hoodie design 😂
I love derec❤❤❤❤
I wonder what it would do if it was filled up with water
I would love for them to collab with Sidemen especially with the balloons
Yall should use a bucket of oobleck vs the world's largest blender see what happens since it'll harden on impact.
And I thought we Germans only had the craziest ideas 😂
I'm curious an EStop will work no matter the situation unless the EStop is a software type as EStop are physical button that literally break the power to the device
Someone needs to dub the interstellar theme over this
Should’ve blended that spider
VFD! VARIABLE FREQUENCY DRIVE!!   ALSO, do NOT run that thing again until you figure out where your safety relay circuit FAILED. E- Stop must work without fail!
now wheres the cat
This might be the craziest giant something yet, bonkers
They literally had a Chernobyl A Zed 5 moment.
That was intense. Best part that surfboard giving its all. GG Guys GG. Would be epic if you made a water tight blender, not sure if that would be possible at such a scale. How many people could one that size feed? Super Smoothies. lol
That surfboard surfed it’s last wave 😭
i love how there are random holes in the ground from past things they have done!
You MUST blend an actual Blendtec blender.
I think the issue might have been the belt getting overheated from the smoke coming up, because if it was the motor, then it would not start up again.
"Well that's not in one piece anymore" absolute Gaunson classic
This is the like the best episode of “will it blend?” ever!
How Ridiculous can Humans be?  Yes!
This’s your best idea yet…
Will it blend?
Could you make the worlds largest milkshake with that blender? If you do could you invite me to come and drink some? Lol Love you guys!!!!!!!!
I thought the first drop was going to break the sides. Fantastic build!
Michael POV>>>
Video starts 14:06
i really hope to see a version 2 of this blender, bigger and more powerful.
Rename it "instant carnage device".
Great video gents, but you sometimes forgot to show the slowy after the action
LOL!!!! Can you draw an H between c and the O? Too funny!!
Puh....pu........put your enemies in it.....do it......
should be used a 2-stroke engine instead of an electric motor
Loved the video! Maybe you can do a part 2 and make the Worlds Largest Smoothie!
This should LSX engine powered
I've played too much happy wheels and the thoughts that went through my head are awful
The heart 😢
BLENDAHHHHHHHH!
if the e-stop is not working, then whoever installed it did it wrong.
You need to bring comtests back
what a waist.
E-stop should be wired with two normally closed contacts in series to avoid situations like this. It would take an engineering analysis to determine whether it should be connected to a Safe Torque Off terminal on the VSD, or if it should just completely cut the power by means of dual contactors also wired in series.
VSD?   i think you meant VFD = Variable frequancy drive lol
The good ol' Emergency-accelarate button
14:00 mm, my favorite lighting. the foreground is sunlit while the background is dark and stormy.
RIP Milhouse
i'm getting really tired of accents. you're not speaking english. but i subbed anyways.
Thanks for addressing the sketchiness of standing inside the blender. That was my first thought seeing him stand in there.
Do not be standing in that blender again when fail safes don’t even work.
Who would of enjoyed watching their mate get blended when cleaning out the fruit?
You should have put an 11 on the dial
It needs coolant to not fry itself
I bet if you made a tornado siren out of the blenders motor it would deffin everyone
This is the most appropriately named channel in all of You Tube. 👍🏼
They all look wired out their heads 😂 👃…..
Will it blend has reached a new high. Don't breathe this!
You should blend the cow.
I hope the videos are no longer being filmed in Australia otherwise WTF ARE U DOING FLICKING A SPIDER JUST LIKE THAT WTFFFFF (yeh yeh, y'all gonna tell me it was safe, that's that particular species wasn't dangerous... IS FUCKING AUSTRALIA JUST AVOID TOUCHING ANYTHING JUST INCASE!!!)
all the things i cant financially own, they could just buy one and destroy lmao...i wanna jump in that blender
Hopefully it's still under warranty 😉
Mr How Ridiculous i going to say i'm impressed you're build is big kind of thing called blender even better i wish you put i don't know mangoes in big blender PSIYCHO
God, the absurdity of this channel never ceases to amaze me. Love it
4:36 World's most terrifying Cash Cube
Best video ever!!!
How you guys do it
cool
Make the world's largest smoothy
Sure, it destroys machinery a treat, but how many milkshakes can it make? 😋
When they wanted to see objects flying and getting destroyed without having to move a muscle!
Once you’re done making content with it, this thing could be pretty darn useful for getting rid of stuff. Can’t fit that couch in your truck to take it to the dump? Blend it
Gotta say it was pretty funny when he flicked the spider .Loved the video crazy how it didn’t turn off when you wanted it too
It'll be cool to see a bunch of blank canvases get painted by the blender with spray paint! Though I think the canvases would be damaged by the debris... I'll still slap one on my wall, haha.
Where are all the golf balls??
That surfboard wanted to surf to it's death.
Need to build a giant cross bow
I'm actually scared that there is a part 2 after the E-Stop failure. I personally would have 44 Clubbed and ended it at that point.
The cows after this video why is it spicy
4:35 sooo... Anyone else remember that old game 'Hoppin Poppin Spaceballs'?
That is an excellent idea why, instead of putting monsters serial killers and paedophiles, in prison use this giant blender very very good, and once they are Blended the monsters, for extremely very bad people like monsters, they deserve the blended of death, and once they are Blended, they are flushed down the toilet, or they are flash down hungry piranhas that would be an excellent idea😅
While I don't have much knowledge (if any) regarding VFD Drives or the equipment in question I would hope someone with greater knowledge than me on this subject could chime in if anything is incorrect.  I would suspect when the VFD Drive was sped up via the controller under the giant blender, there could be a possibility that one or more safeties were overridden that would protect the drive.  For the speed increase, there is a possiblity that, while blender was under a greater load than normal, there was a voltage line dip, the generator controller in response is to increase the engine RPM to keep a stable voltage. With that came a increase in the RPM of the blender.  For the smoke from the generator, depending on where it came from, if from the exhaust pipe, which I would suspect, is the response to the greater load as mentioned before. However, if not, the safety in the generator would disengage and shut off the generator as would be a direct short condition.  For the smoke from under the giant blender, there are two possibilities... 1A. If the VFD is under-spec, then again, the safety would disengage the VFD and throw up an error regarding an overload condition. 1B. If the safety in the VFD was overridden, then there is a possibility that the VFD is partially cooked. 2. For the motor, at this time only one possibly can be seen from this, the motor is either partially cooked / damaged in such a way that the controller may not know till it is too late as the motor may require more power to operate correctly as the impedance of the motor, in certain windings may be greater than when it was new. I think the term is Degraded Operation
Well the massive amount of non-biodegradable materials just being dumped on the ground was enough for me to stop watching this video and unsubscribed!  What a huge mess and blatant disregard for future generations.
As me being a panel wire man/button wiring hearing the fact that the E-Stop isn’t working is quite terrifying when you have 480 volts or more powering something that big and drawing that much electricity
Where’s the slowy?
hhehehehehahahahahaHAHAHAHA I CAN FINALLY COVER ALL OF THE DEAD BODIES IN MY BASEMENT
A barrel full of Rexies!
Having the "Jesus Christ" switch fail on something that has no problems taking your head off has got to be terrifying 😬
Put tarps down around the blender to make clean up easy
Yall are doing what I would do if I made a bunch of money. This is pure, heavenly entertainment 💚
Mates, you don't need to make click-bait clickies. We'll watch it despite the weird picture. Ty
Please boys, dont risk yourselfs, the power has already shown instability, getting INSIDE the blender again after this for cleanup would be negligence to your own security!
Collab with @theslowmoguys would be awesome!
Definitely insane! Love ya guys and you wacky experiments. Keep up the awesome work.
My favorite video you guy have done so far. hope u do more with this blender
what the heck man, dangerous
their next video: Making The World's Largest Cat💀
the blender sounds like the opening cut scene to gta San Andreas
I wonder if Super Dave Osborne could master this...
Props to your fabricator!!!! That's some STOUT kit.
2:25 wait till Pete Gustin sees this. Oh wait... 💀
These guys have more fun than should be allowed by law.
Waste
Wow
That E-Stop not working was a bit concerning, but boy did we laugh through the entire vid! 😂
collab with mr indian hacker once
Osc: “GB NOO”🤓
The rope tightens around the axis and jamming the blade, you scientists 😅
Best ever!
I would not have gone near that spider.. but then I’m not Aussie
Bouncy balls
Cast iron skillet
Can of gasoline next
So, the takeaway from this video is that golf balls are invincible 😂.
You people are INSANE! This is the funniest destruction video I have ever seen! I can't even believe what I am watching. The world needs more of you!
All we need is V8 power and Jeremy clarksson! 😂
i wish u drop some human
blend a whole cow!
legendary
It's not the first biggest bladder. Its the second biggest bladder.
Now make a giant smoothie
You should try to make the worlds biggest grimace shake
Taking 6 days in Africa to score a basketball shot from a 200m waterfall is still your most impressive feat, but this really might be the most certifiably _insane_ thing you've done yet. Love it!
there is no way they picked up every piece of trash, this is dumb and just bad for the environment.
Rubber band ball would have been good here
Imagine a cow will land in the giant blender and the blender will turn on. The cow will blended into bloody pieces. 😂😅😅
Team up with boost juice and make the biggest boost juice ever
This made me smile so much haha just thank you guys for making the stupidest ideas a reality 🤣
I am honestly worried for your lives someone's 😅
This reminds me of the game happy wheels😂
Y’all should put a car in there
When the king of blenders becomes self aware?
PLEASE put in a fully sized ballistics gel human. A whole new twist on the question, “will it blend?” .
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Ballistics gel around a skeleton next time please.
This gotta be the most fucked up thing you have done! 😁🤣🤪
"Our buttons that mean nothing" 😂 its a cool prop. Crazy awesome video!!!
This device is ideal for recycling decimated CCP participant's carcasses into fertilizers or feeds.
What would happen if you put a human child in it tho🧐🧐🧐🧐
Please don't harm the nature and pick up your trash
Did the diesel generator start to run away, and that caused a power surge? Two, working in a factory, your E-stop MUST work it should cause a total power loss.
The surfboard did it's job the best❤
Genuine terror on their faces!
that is so silly, and obviously just the best.
Really enjoy all you guys have come up with especially the how ridiculous language that I am not fluent in. The wife cant differentiate between the ohhhs and ahhhhs, leg slaps, giggles, and the holy(basically every holy possible ) craps, etc but I understand every word. Thanks guys.
We should put all the homeless people in there
When the emergency stop button says NO, you're gonna have a bad time.
Literally a giant blender. Well done.
Smoke coming out of the generator's exhaust when you loaded it heavily sounds normal in this situation, I assume that's the smoke you guys were seeing. Most of the time you guys run the generator with little or no load, which causes "wet stacking" in the diesel engine. When you introduced a higher load to the generator, the engine started to burn off some of the unburnt fuel and soot collecting in the exhaust.
Now you just gotta make the world's largest smoothie
Well, something learned today is that putting a golf club in a big blender is more dangerous then getting hit by a golf ball😂
The amount of interesting things you guys find to do with a big spinny is amazing
try to 3000 rpm please
what did I just witness 🤯
This is by far the coolest piece of machinery u have ever built!!
drop a big subwoofer into the blender
DUDE U GUYS ROCK
rexy
When E-Stop wasn’t working, I got so nervous for you all. I’m glad you guys got that under control!!! Can’t wait for part 2!
Sigh.... The Simpsons... Predicted this...
"People who think you have to learn the English language are wrong. You have to memorize it."  Yeah that's what learning is.
Brains in a blender
This one was good. A shame you guys didn't do a giant ice block.
Where's the "will is blend" guy. Definitely needed to be invited.
That surfboard was shredding
Please make a second video on this blender, but use a ballistic dummy lab torso. I’m very curious to see what would happen. 😊
OSHA approved!!
why don't you put a V 8 as the motor for the blender ?
Can Bruce stop the blender? 😏
I doubt that's covered by warranty
Honestly just change ur channel name to guys will be guys at this point😭😭
I'd like to see a ballistics dummy zombie torso in the blendy.
Will it blend
No one should go in the blender regardless of safeguards. 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
when you say multiple fail safes, foreshadowing!
"0:24" to "0:36" is fair dinkum the best sound bite eva!
i'm surprised the poly didn't break. good stuff
Does the guy with the green hat teeth ever get cold?
You guys need to use this too make the worlds biggest milkshake or malt
As far as the increase in the speed as the golf pull as the golf balls were being blended. What was the total topped out speed by chance? Next time you update the next video.
My intrusive thought is distracting me from watching this video… Imagine if they put a person in that thing.  I’m not sorry! You are all thinking it! Do you know how sometimes when a person gets injured severely, they may not feel it right away because they go into shock?  Would you really feel that much before you turned to mush? Don’t let the Commies get it! 😂
That could have gone so very very wrong. I'm sure you'll figure out why the estop failed and fix that, but I hope you also beef up the failure mode and effects analysis portion of your engineering, as well as taking additional steps to make sure everyone knows where all the e-stops and any other safety devices are.
Now that you have created it, you and Mark Rober need to collaborate a d make this think make giant milk shakes.
"If there's one thing you don't put into your blender it's a bowling ball."   Well thank god you warned me Stanford, was about to try that tonight!
Best idea ever!
I wanna see the thing full of Fruit and Veggies, like an actual blender, make the largest smoothie with it.
This has to be the best HR video ive seen
Yall should sell the sredded items
should have got the Blendtec guy
Good old Will It Blend commercial is back
Good show keep it up 🎉
It was probably pulling too much power because you got debris jamming the motor and it pulls the maximum current trying to keep turning.  Just my hunch - I’ve seen that happen to lots of motors and you guys sure made a lot of debris/particulate.  Get that mixing with the lubricant on the bearings and you can get a nice sludge going too.  That explains why it started working again too, that sludge kinda slides out of the way after you let it sit for a bit.  But then comes back.
This is my new favorite thing!!! 🤘😎🤘
Is it cake or real.. Blender edition but with things that look like other things and we have to guess
After you guys are done breaking this thing (which I’m guessing will be the next video), drop it from the tower. I like your ‘bigger versions of normal things’ videos, but I fell in love with you guys when you were dropping smash-able things from high places. ❤😂❤😂
I'm wondering whether the smell and smoke you got from the blender was because ot he belt slipping on the pully.  Also the smoke from the generator was because it was unable to meet the power consumption when blending the  golf balls for as long as you kept the blender running. The generator should have tripped - that's a bit troubling !!
Surpassing Mythbusters!
The way it stopped working you should put a Hamilton Beach sticker on it 😂
Anyone else notice the guy gurning his face off? 🎉😂
Praise the Lord you're not dead. You are a treasure, and it'd be a sad day to lose any of you!
“Will it blend” blender edition
"We DO think about our safety"  Lifts heavy weight with back
Since I work around  ski lifts, hearing “the e-stop isn’t working!” Is not something I wanna hear
I keep thinking that they should clean the inside of this thoroughly, make some kind of huge beverage/smoothie thing, and serve it at a big party…
That was definitely a 9.6 at least on the sphincter scale!
Polystyrene would be very interesting to watch and see it look like pure snowstorm
When is part 2?
THE CLIFFHANGA
you should drop the cow in the blender
If only they had the guts to drop the cow in
Best giant video by far out of giant hammer and giant axe
Congratulations, guys.  You managed to build something even more frightening that that helicopter with the swordblade rotor.
When was this actually filmed????? I live in the states, Florida to be exact, and it's currently in the 112 degree Fahrenheit area for temps... HOW THE HECH ARE YALL WEARING HOODIES?????
I have a 10 iron!!!  That's the first time I've seen someone else with one
Sorry...it wasn't error 56...it turbo 44.  I took control of it and just wanted to keep powering it up as Bret said to.  I killed it.
3:48 Says there are multiple fail safes, then proceeds to only say one of them
This is going to end up in a saw movie.  This thing is terrifying.
I hope one day y’all will make a video comically overusing the explosion exit at approx 2:50
This f***ing channel...is appropriately named
Blend the cow
Please make the world's largest smoothie.
I love all of your videos, but I think I found my favorite! That was awesome!
That thing is freaking awesome!
Channel has gone from entertainly ridiculous, to scarily negligent. Really hope someone doesnt get hurt or worse.
How about 10,000 Eggs in a Blender? 🤔🤔
i love the new idea! waiting for more!
This video is an instant winner.
What about a giant pendulum? Like a foucault pendulum or even one of those pendulum roller coasters 😂 just imagine that scene in zombieland but vs a fridge or a safe and you can put the items in different areas and see what gets hit!
HEY THERE GUYS! WE'RE WATCHING THIS VIDEO AND WE THINK YOU NEED TO MAKE THE WORLD'S BIGGEST MILK SHAKE WITH THIS BLENDER PLEEEEEEASE  😊💜🙏🙏
Just when we thought it couldnt get any more ridiculous...
lmaoooo whos gonna wash that thing
A new era begins…
@willitblend
You learn a lot about people when something serious actually goes wrong. Freezing up isn’t always the best choice 😂
My wife wants the ridiculous hoodie.....any chance of merch?
"For those of you worrying we have safety's" Biggest safety fails to work
If you guys are going to be blending on grass you should put a tarp down in front of the door… better for the grass and easier for you cleaning up!
loved it
Oh My God, that is hilarious
I love your videos
Hi, 😂
put a whole pig in it.alive or otherwise,dealers choice
PLEASE put in a fully sized ballistics gel human
Please don’t kill yourselves 😂 one of the best channels on YouTube
Did Gaunsan get his GED in highschool? lol
We just leave it on forever.  What a joyful line!
Honestly guys...I don't know how you keep doing it.  But...this is amazing.
this is a top 10 idea lads
You should get a skip bin and a forklift to put next to the blender so you don't have to clean up twice 😅
Well. That. Is. Terrifying.
I live in Arizona, USA. I have to tell you guys it was VERY hot this summer and I know it usually gets a little hotter down there. You are probably going to have lots of heat your coming summer and lots of sunshine. Definitely will need Sunscreen!
Yall should try to make an actual smoothie with that blender
Pre-bowling ball drop was Oppenheimer levels of tension
nice.
What happened to slowy
OMG WITHOUT EVEN WATCHING I KNOW THIS IS GONNA BE RIDICULOUSLY GREAT!!!
How did you clean up debris to make sure it doesnt hurt the cows?
Make the world largest lemonade stand and the world largest cup
Something with 🎆🎇 would be awesome 😎😎😎
12:59 that “Oh noo…” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Alright, now drop the tungsten cube.😂😂😂
Will it blend? That is the question. Yes, it blends.
this needs a cooperation with theslomoguys
Toss the bicycle into it. ☺️
Seriously SLOW MO GUYS BRING YOUR EQUIPMENT TO THESE GUYS!!!! Collab!!!! Please!!!! (going to their most recent video and commenting)
They might be joking and stuff, but then there are moments when you feel like you see the pure genious behind it. They clearly knew what they were doing when the E-Stop situation occured. What a hectic situation that was, truely. You just gotta ask... How ridiculous?!
how many buttons were just props?
Sure glad that insurance covers appliances.
PART 2 SOON PLEASE! 🙏
The “will it blend guy” is losing his mind.
The worst thing is, your selfie video is too much, we really much didn't like your selfie face and reaction, we have our own reaction.
These guys literally act like 12 year olds. It’s embarrassing to watch lol
Basically, when a motor has to pull power through a long cord the resistance in the cord will drop the voltage. The only way for the draw to get to its requested power it to then draw more amperage. Because it gets harder to move more voltage the longer the power cord is.
The blender you use in your kitchen has a round cup not a square one and that really makes a big difference.
Glad everyone is safe
This is better than the giant flyswatter, and that was my favorite machine. Lol.

Soooo... whither pt 2?
@sketkt
Part 2?!
IRL happy wheels
14:09 Lotto rollover😅
The blender is amazing
That. Thing. Is. TERRIFYING.
lads, this was ridiculous
Why destroy actual vintage golf clubs that most importantly, have real significant historical value, but also have monetary value significantly higher than $20?
Make the world biggest milkshake in it cus why not
How do yall come up with these things.
Surfboards will surf.
Should have bought a Blendtec…
4:44 we need 10 hours
The heart 🤣🤣😭
Fucking hell that’s mental 😂
Don't give the elites any Ideals, will you take the Mark?   Jump if not.
0:27 drop the cow!
Just when I thought you guys had nothing left…. this, hell yes
It looked to me like the cable that was hanging things over the blender was tangling it up and stopping it
if your kids misbehave put there electronics in there and make them start it at level 5
BEST ONE YET!!!
Imagine getting dropped into this thing lmao oopfh
Stevo should try to ride the surf board for his next stunt
I don't think Rexy could survive this. 😂
Not gonna lie. This was one of my favorite things you’ve made! Just watching things bounce around and get destroyed. Beautiful!

I really that the cover was clickbait.... boy was I wrong
Blender best yet then the dam drops.
Why does the blender sound like the lasers on superman 3 😅😅
gotta be the craziest thing you've built AND I FRICKING LOVE IT! also fridge blend was the best thing i've ever seen lol
NAHHH use a helicopter blade LOL
How much to make a video like this got to know this great
Ive been an engineer for the past 7 years and you can trust me when i say that if you turn that machine any higher than 8000 rpm it will explode just for reference it will explode exactly like 26 c4’s oh and the reason it didnt turn off it’s because the golf balls weigh a lot and that pushes the propeller down which usually the e stop has a lock that slows down the machine bringing it to a stop but the propeller pushed down so much that the lock actually went pass the point where it was supposed to lock in and stop it so the generator just stopped the electricity to the machine again bringing it to a stop i know  i sound like mark rober but trust me its for your safety
get a shave!
Time for self care, buds.  You are looking burnt, like homeless addicts in some cases.  It's no fun watching sick people.  Test yourself.   Set a time, like 2 weeks from now and go cold turkey.  If you are too dependent you will see it.  If you keep on like this you will not last long.
What a lovely idea to use a gas generator to power an electric motor xD. Next time skip the middle man and just power the motor with gas.
If you don’t get that motor checked, I am not watching vid 2. That is an unwise hazard waiting to happen, especially consider the kill switch.   Gawnson was literally inside the blender.
You guys have kept your energy throughout the years, and I can gladly say that you’re the only YouTubers I can continue to love no matter what you post. Keep up the great work!
Don't breathe this...
When the E-stop didn't turn it off but started going even faster, I got flashbak to the HBO Chernobl series when they pressed AZ-5 and the reactor exploded! Scary...
I wish they'd dropped a side of beef
the speed should have been set to 44
Boys, if your E stop is going through the computer then it is not an Emergency Stop.  You see, emergencies occur because the computer systems fail.  Your Emergency Stop should either be a direct blade switch, or similar.  Also, I although it could have been left on the editing floor, you never mentioned how you were able to protect yourself against stored energy in the  few instances where the blades stopped unexpectedly.  I'm happy to advise further regarding safety around stored energy, and emergency management, but I'm sure Editor Jack can handle the Tool Box Talks...
Best episode ever
That legitimately turned into a scary movie at then end! Holy heck that was “pshyco” 😂
This thing is legitimately terrifying! Also, being that ruminants will eat anything, the THINGS they will find in those steers's stomachs!
why not 44Club level power?   Also Blend some Rexys!
I highly suggest getting a ballistic dummy to show just how much carnage that blender could dish out. Cause really when would anyone ever get to see a giant blender in action?! Love the videos!
pillow fight tiiiimeeee 😄
9:56 the most aussi thing that could happen
"Will it blend" Eat your HEART out🤣 I would also be UPSET had I been the one in there cleaning and this fail happened later🤣
I think they added one too many prop buttons in the bunker
cheers boys! you just earned me a big raise!! showed this to my boss at the Gulf Cartel, he loved the idea!
The person who blended the cat should be put into this
10:00 just flicking the giant creepy spider no problem, what an Australian thing to do
Can we do human analog next time?
Who eva came up with this idea must be a genius and deserves a massive pay increase 👊✌️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Well that blended two of my favourite things together, golf and YouTube.
Sphookhy.... or something....💪👍🌞
Of all years i have been watching you. This is your best idea so far! Love you guys! :'D
Your best idea yet.
Crazzzyzyy
That ending... Dude, thats a "brown pants" moment if I've ever seen one.
fill it half way with small pebbles
Lol wtf
Omg yes!!! What a great idea!!! :)
The one time a youtube video actually deserves the "(GONE WRONG)" clickbait title
You should build a wind tunnel out of that thing like with propellers
Blend crash test dummy
You guys come up with the most dangerous shit for our entertainment...Thank you for that 🤣🤣🤣
10:00 OH, THERE IS A SPIDER!! Then flicks the c... out of it LOL
Guess that long cord drops the volts a bit..
you guys are getting closer and closer to making jigsaw traps like john cramer lol
I love the perfect “man logic” of this video.  Let’s build the world’s biggest, fastest, sketchiest blender of death… max it out to full power… dump 10,000 golf balls in it… what could go wrong?!?!  Lol love it, keep up the fun guys!!
The New York Lottery Jackpot is now 1.5 Billion dollars. Start picking winners boys.
Oh, I forgot it was mid winter in Australia. Stay warm boys.
Your dial *NEEDS* to go to '11'. You know that, right?
Maybe it's because you're running a 220 motor off 3 extension cords
You guys do a good job with keeping it fresh. You never know what these masters of destruction are going to destroy next. It is all  good harmless fun, which is why I watch.
Baraka wins
Coolest thing ever ❤❤❤❤
You should blend a giant block of ice and make snowcones
The weight of them golf ball would of made it hard on the motor possibly send power back to the generator
That spider was so Australian lol
golf club gonna render holes in your blender
We NEED another episode of this with the giant blender and have not Rhet and Link host it but have the slow mo guys do all the videos
E-Stop seems to be software-based. That ain't good in the case of a crash or freeze (not UNLIKE a computer). E-stop needs to be it's own circuit and system, if not hard wired right into the power connection.
Willy Wonka vibes
The ingenuity you guys have never ceases to amaze! What on earth will you lot come up with next? That mechanical failure was next level psycho, glad that everyone is OK. I honestly didn't think that the bowling ball would blend, I was in shock. My mom even called out asking what was going on 😂
My name suggestion is "the West Texas tornado"
This guy gave blend surfing a whole new meaning
You guys should make the world's biggest milkshake
mag ik die ff lenen
Pt2now😭
Homie with the camera and beanie just yelling stop it and cowering needs to learn how to turn generator off instead of panicking.
Was this filmed after WCE defeated North Melbourne? The shinboner spirit sent me!  *cries in NM supporter*
Does it have a gooify setting? Reminded me immediatly of the simpsons halloween episode where the teachers are eating the school kids lol, then we get to the end at it was a Tim Taylor tool time moment!!!
"The E-Stop is not working!" should be a title for a horror/sci-fi movie in which a rogue AI takes over all of our machines.
Epic fun! You don’t get old and stop playing, you get old when you stop playing.
Will it blend?  Yes.
Why didn't you put the lid on for all the blends? Seems like a lot came out the top; how do you clean that up? Wouldn't want a cow to eat a piece of glass
Now I'm curious to see what would happen to the cow.
E-NOTSTOPPENHEIMER.
I hope part 2 starts with them figuring out why the e-stop didn’t work and fixing it.
VFD= variable frequency drive
You GUYS ARE NUTS but 😎
Base Reminds me a little of the GeForce machine Astronaus use.
Is there a round encasing super size blender design too somewhere?
3:05 I hope this video doesn't get demonetized  Edit: Corrected the timer
This channel keeps getting more and morr RIDICULOUS! 😂.
Love the video as always and Jack looking super cute in this one 😏
Yoh, if you dropped a dead cow in that blender you’d get fined by the peta a WWF.
Terrifying but wildly exciting! Love the wild things yawl think of & so much hard work, time & money put into these vids . Thank you for bringing so much excitement when I get the notification of a new video. 🔥 can’t wait for part 2😈
You have to put 44 on the dial!!
Why is 44 not after 3 on that dial!!!
Once again, you guys do not disappoint. And you definitely bring true meaning to the name of your channel. Lol.
Dudes, leave the spider alone…
This is awesome, but needs 2 things:  - A hose (to clean out the bits of fruit, veg, fridge, whatever).  - A ballistic gel dummy (to see what would happen if you didn't pay attention to safety so much...).
Can you blend a lawnmower or a Nokia phone
A Blendtec "Will it Blend" episode writ large!! Lol
If you want a foolproof e-stop, use the crane to dangle the genny over the blender, with the other end of teh rope attached to the 'lid'. Have a pneumatic axe next to the rope with a cable running from the mechanism to the bunker. If you need to e-stop, pull the rope, this will fire the axe into the rope cutting it, causing the lid to lift up and the genny to fall into the blender and get blended - leaving the blender with no power hence stopping it.
PSIECOH
Blending blenders is a sure fire way to start.
Blendtech has entered the chat. 😂😁😜🤟
0:25 In a parallel universe the boys are blending a cow while a little blender is screaming in the background
What so much bovine around copper but no ground beef?
steak anyone???
I had no idea how much I wanted to see a giant blender until I saw this!!
No cows were hurt in the making of this video.
You never clickbait this is why i love your channel
Haven’t watched in a while and I almost didn’t recognize these Aussie boys, they went from lads to dads 😅
That surfboard didn’t want to leave it wasn’t his time to go😂
I will admit the e-stop was a mini panic but I laughed like heck once it turned out OK lol
I can't wait for part 2!
you should've made a really big milkshake lol
what is the gender of YOUR blender?
Great vid 😂
I am sorry if I saw the cow and the blender and was thinking about sth wrong 😅
This whole entire Channel is definitely, “For the boys”.
4:17 i love how hes surprised by his own vote after checking it
More of this! So much fun to watch
I think everyone involved should know where every single emergency stop switch, button, or plug is just in case something like this happens
5:50 I saw all of these clips when they released, am I ready for the 44-club lore exam? 😂
I'm so glad you guys did this but take it as a learning lesson. Filling a normal blender basically does what happened with the golf balls. Imagine golf balls are already scaled to size of what would come out of a blender. Putting small things in there wont do anything but push it around. The beauty of Will It Blend? was the nonsensical items that would go into the blender. The golf clubs were top tier.
This is honestly why YouTube is more entertaining than TV. On TV, when something is sketch, or goes wrong, you still know it will end fine otherwise they wouldn’t air it. On YouTube though, it could really end either way.
Ha
You can make a really big drink in that blender, you should try making beverages with it!
The channel truly lived up to its name in this video! 😄
This is absolutely insane. But the noise it makes when it’s empty is awful.
Second idea: drop from the crane into a reduction gear thingy for splitting up cars.
Alright boys it's time. We need it. Worlds largest smoothie. Set a record. Get you some watermelons, some oranges or grapefruits, maybe some other melons, fill that thing to the brim, add a bit of water for traction and some ice for consistency. Let that sucker spin for like 5 minutes. Wanna see what happens
You guys made a soul shredder
At first, I thought the sound that the bull/steer was making in the beginning was coming from Derek! 🤣
Love this channel, truly a man thing. I was disappointed this time, tennis balls and golf balls naa, some of my wife's antique furniture would be good
Will It Blend would be proud.
Put a pig carcass in it
Nobody hit the big red prop button... That's clearly what went wrong!
When you do a fake smile use your eyes too, that was the deadest happy face I've ever seen.
You should name the blender “Mr.blendy”
Great fake drama at the end there, boys! Sorry the golf balls were a bust!
Scottie can't spell!
This thing is terrifying! I love it!
World's largest Blentec Blender 😄
WOW THIS IS INSANE!!
13:23 I HONEST TO GOD cannot believe that he is genuinely this unintelligent and this much richer than i am... you really don't need no brains for success in the new world
Everything put into this experiences instantaneous disassembly. Aka high speed come apart for mouth breathers…
PLEASE PUT A GIANT RUBBER BAND BALL IN THERE
them standing in the blender make me real nervous....
as a generator technician, hearing e-stop not working was intense. glad it did work on the actual generator though.
This is BY FAR your best contraption to date... very cool and fun to watch
Our dials go to 11
the watermelon was fantastic to watch
ngl would have loved to see a slowy of the surfboard   this is epic🎉 great reactions guys!
that monster would easily blend humans :/ fuck...
This is the best idea they’ve had in a while. Great vid boys. Visually amazing and funny.
You guys should put a giant steel flywheel on the motor shaft and get up to speed before dropping anything in, so even if the motor cuts out there’s still a bunch of momentum and energy to keep the blender going!  (Big flywheels are super dangerous, this comment does not make me liable for any injuries or damage sustained due to flywheels)
i swear the slowmo shots used to be so much slower at the tower videos?
What about some meat ? :P I know such good things to put in 😆But kids watching this lol. Make an 18+ channel 🤣
OMG this is one of the best video's ive seen. So cool hahaha!!
Fun fact: these guys are going to have to make the worlds largest vacuum cleaner after this mess….
The YouTube compression algorithm did not like the tennis balls.
this is a fking saw trap if ive ever seen one
lmao , good blend !
GTA san andreas theme 0:41
Out of everything you guys have done, this might be the craziest thing you've ever built. Spinning Katanas was one, but this is a new level 😂
wish ❤
Whoa that was intense
I'd love to see a ballistics gel body go in there. hmm.. who else is thinking this ?
The spinning blender blades of death
Fair play chaps you really have outdone yourselves this time
The tennis balls were like bees in a blender...visually.
I wanna go in
Okay without sounding conceited, I just came up with a brilliant idea I can't believe you guys don't have for cleanup you need a gigantic Shop-Vac! I look forward to seeing it when you build it, you're welcome.
I almost want to say the smoke was the belts slipping.
I laughed a lot with this one.
THAT WAS THE MOST HECTIC SHEESH IVE EVER WATCHED WTH!!
Gentlemen you have out done yourself, this machine is incredible theres so much potential here. Can we get it totally water tight and make the worlda largest smoothie, or proten shake by blending 100 chcikens lol
i think someone needs to calm down with that Columbian marching powder 🤣
will it blend, extreme edition!
I didn't think you could up with something better than the big hatchet but you did!  Great!
Ridiculous indeed. Lol you guys have no limits eh? The video is also a great example for how important engineering and design of systems really is, especially fail safe and emergency systems. The E-stop was tied into the VFD or control board for the generator, not physically disconnecting anything. A function not previously tested. Scary!
Imagin a human in that
World record?
As someone who works with heavy machinery and VFD/VSD's, I felt Herron's line "E-stop didn't turn it off, E-Stop has to turn it off!" in my bones.
HR just reinvented "Will It Blend?"
Great way of disposing of a body.....🤣
Well, they wrote PSICHO on the blender, and it did what it was told. It went TurboPSICHO
Almost be Final Destination
SKPs..? ;)
Put powder paint in the blender to see a tornado
Just when I thought things couldn't get any more terrifying I hear "The E Stop isn't working"
No Estop??! How does that even happen?
Do 10m or else I’ll unsub
I am definitely mentally disturbed for wanting one of Zombie-go-boom's ballistic zombie dummies to be put in there
Australia: you cannot own a gun Also Australia: ......
That was the VFD or VSD that burned out. Your controls are connected to that.
VFD Gaunson. Lol  Variable frequency drive 👍🤘👏
Do a ballistics lab dumby!!!!
Not sure how realistic it is, but I think you guys should have each wall of the blender be a door so you can easier clean out the inside without having to stand in the kill zone
How ridiculous is that…
Blend Jack.
I think you should of dropped the balls in while the blender was on. 😁
Obrut
I think the one thing this channel has taught me more than anything is that bowling balls are not nearly as tough as I thought they were
This video is pshychotic
I would not go near that thing unless it was for sure unplugged
This is exactly what YouTube was made for
Well it’s super impressive that the sorta failed helicopter blades seems to tired into a great idea. Not saying it was bad but the blades broke and barely cut stuff as they fell and was not quite what you where looking for I would assume. So a great idea to shift the build into a blender and create a reason to keep the action within camera view and more constant. But also it’s funny and crayz enough to be enjoyable. What an interesting development for throwing things off a higher place….always fun to see where you guys go
"You don't learn the English language, you memorize it." - So true.
I hope the tungsten cube is going into the blender in Part 2.
Left handed clubs in that golf bag, I could have done with them lol
go for part two, pleace hahahaha.  it's fun
Best vid yet, boys!!!
100,000 rubber bouncy balls vs blender hmmm…?
Why not ludicrous speed?
PSYCHO😮
Would like to have seen ping pong balls
Seeing the emergency stop fail gave me a flashback to the human in the blender earlier. I know it was disconnected from power but still.
Cow got nervous thinking mac Donald's had moved in
Imagine your job was just destroying things in various ways. Dream
6:30 I know they didn’t blend the bowling ball live yesterday and I live about 9,817 miles from where they shot this, but I still leaned back and winced when it hit the blades lol
Love the content, but this one wasn't too good with that e-stop fail. Can't help but worry a bit if it were to go off the rails.
How Ridiculous is that 😂😂😂😂
Wondering if the motor is stopping because it can’t get up to top speed causing it to draw 6x to 8x the running amperage. That would cause things to overheat or damage the motor windings.
I realize that you can’t “legally” drop a person in there…but could you imagine the look on Kim Jong Un’s face as he is released??? 😮😮😮
"Look at that spider!" *zooms in* *flick* "Oop"  😂😂😂
You should blend like those feather pillows
Привет из России, у вас там холодно летом? 😮Вот кайф, вот бы у нас так, мы тут плавится от жары
wow.
the metal fabricator guy must have worked in manufacturing, and dealt with literal power lockouts on every machine, it's mandatory...big switches with padlocks...OSHA/health and safety styles
back to channel after a long time
Mark my words this will be one of ur most viewed vids. God bless love it
I use to like this channel, not so much anymore. Honestly it’s getting old and boring, not to mention the blatant cash grab every week. Putting broken crap up for sale, t shirts with paint all over them and really crap mech they are pushing. Boys it’s either time to stop completely or take a break and get back to what the channel once was with challenges and this stuff. Not using the same prop every week and just redressing it as something else.
Oh my goodness you guys are absolutely MENTAL!! Whatever contraption will you come up with next?! 😂
So gaunson cant say escapees or spell psycho..okay 😅😅
How big is the worlds biggest milkshake? Seems to me...
The Herron leap into golf balls didn’t look too soft 😂
Yeah I don't know about this one boys. I was always raised to never put a bowling ball in a blender. I really don't think that was a good idea
That was ridiculous
So good
N  U  T  S .  .  .  🤩
You guys are great.  "This might be the end of all things" hahaha
redo the golf balls but at night with glow in the dark paint on them
I thought they were gonna drop the cow.
ballistics gel human vs blender they even have life-like bones on the good ones from ballistic dummy labs
This is without a doubt one of the best things you’ve ever done! Absolutely mental and I love it!
They Should Use This As A Trap In The New Saw Movie. 😂🤘
The smell/smoke at the blender was probably from a slipping drive belt.
In a different world these guys are evil scientists
The pinnacle of How Ridiculous! 👏🏆🤣
Does Breville sell these in stores?
Whoever put that kitten in the blender they're going in next  We finally did it a punishment that fits the crime
Now that you guys have the worlds largest blender, you need to make the worlds largest milkshake/smoothie to fit the bit
put a human in there
LoL
The surf boardlasted for a long time💀💀💀
We take safety seriously  WE CANT TURN IT OFF
more 🙏
Nothing against the video, but I've never subscribed to you guys, yet this appeared in my subscription feed
That sound of the blender spinning up.
blend glow sticks and other glowy things at night?
all the money and resources you could ask for at your disposal....  and this is the content we get  😑😑
These guys have too much time on their hands! 😂😂😂😂
Is the rope winding around the shaft?
The E-stop is not working ...how ridiculous
Unreal video! Been watching you guys for years, Can I have a signed Iron head for my birthday 😁🤙🏻
So satisfying!
As an electrician i know you should not start a rotating motor with the resistance in it. As soon as the motor has its max speed than you can drop the resistance
The fear when everything just started breaking, it started with the smell of smoke, so they hit the E-Stop, that did not work and I could hear the panic in their voices.
Don't breath this.
There is no more terrifying moment than when the Emergency Stop button doesn't work. That's the "Oh Sh*t" button. When the "Oh Sh*t" button doesn't work bad things happen.
Surf Board.. Surfing🔥🔥
How much horsepower?
This was amazing. Can you put tarps or fabric down for easy clean up?
Your arsenal of freaky machines never ceases to amaze. What will these guys think of next?
That machine is terrifying
Is it just me or are they nearing Mythbusters vibes?
Now put tomatoes in that bad boy, team up with that guy with a bajillion eggs and tons of pasta and make the world's biggest pizza 😎
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
this is the best thing ever
Wow another crazy video I really enjoy watching your videos so much your videos always make my day you make me laugh 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤩🥰🔥😲🤯
Golf boll smoke. Don't breathe this!
Ngl, the whole E-stop not working was kinda sketchy, even from the other side of the screen
I have blendaphobia and this video made my hands sweat so much but I managed to watch the parts without the blender ima have nightmares tonight anyway.😂
That is awesome but also my worst nightmare
You really turned it up to Turbo Pshycho!!!
One of thee most entertaining videos from you guys yet. Obviously every single video you blokes do is just an absolute pearler, but this one, oooof, this one hit the spot.
I think you should make a milkshake with the huge blender
You never fail to amaze with your imagination...and many congratulations to your clean up crew!
Awesome dudes!
Best freakin contraption yet boys! Well done!
This is horrifying and I love it
6:06 Jesus, the sound that bowling ball makes when it hits the ground is insane. It sounds like a shotgun blast
I want one for trespassers!!
For safety i think you could put some thick steel rod thru floor(to prevent spining), every time you to in. I would feel much more safe. There is never enought safety precautions :-)
You guys could be the next James Bond villains.
Refrigerator smoothie! Don’t breathe this!
The surfboard did it’s job perfectly 😂😂😂
never good when the magic smoke comes out.
It'll blend, but it won't e-stop
can we just just give massive props to the fabricator who made this ridiculous contraption !!
Did YOU actually build it?
What i say to other people talking about their blenders: "That's not a blender! This, this is a blender!"
an emergency button that does not work... this is scary af.
Ten million orbies
You guys should try blending a safe one of these days
Part 2: we built an even bigger blender to see if the world's (formerly) largest blender would blend.
Hey gents, idk if this is possible, but I think a giant sling shot would be amazing!
The repurposed Diamond plaque case as the button housing lol.
Blendtec x How Ridiculous collab be like:
Guys need to get a ballistics dummy just to see what it would do to anyone inside it
That blender really chose violence today
They are really getting the most out of that spinning thing.
How about invite all the boy scouts and girl guides and make them a giant milkshake?
You guys are freaking awesome! Never thought i would ever see a blender that big... Every video is amazing you deserve every success you guys have 🎉🥳👏🏻⭐🔔
Blender turned itself up to 44.
My sick mind wonna blend that cow
As a WH&S guy, the E Stop not working is an absolute fluster cuck. Fantastic episode though
Viewers flopped heavily on choosing golf balls. What did you all actually think would happen? smh
Worlds largest smoothie???
is this even legal? if so where can i get me one of them.
LOL at the cows chillin in the background.
High or drunk?  Crossfaded?
Drop a Gopro in it
no slowies?
Just when I thought it wouldn't get more dangerous than the sword machine...
*will it blend?* more like *will it survive?*. Great videos guys, keep up the great work
3:39 This makes me wonder (having watched to the end of the video). When Gaunson was standing inside the blender (only on this channel does that make sense), was the power physically disconnected? I sure hope so. We saw on the monitor the “Disconnected Disconnected Disconnected”, but was the power disconnected via a software program? If by software, please change that to the power being physically disconnected.  Additionally, the person who did eventually turn off the generator shouldn’t have had to leave the relative safety of the shipping container to disconnect the generator. Gaunson apparently didn’t even know that there was an e-stop on the generator until everything hit the fan (or hit the blender, in this case). Gaunson (and everyone else there) should have known that there was an e-stop on the generator before filming began. Before starting, have a short walk-around with everybody so everyone knows where the e-stops and whatnot are.  I’m not an expert on best practices for safety involving what could be the world’s largest blender, lol. I’m not an expert on safety in general, lol. I’m just some random stupid-idiot in your comments section. But I’m sure there is a very qualified person in Perth that you can consult with. Someone with industrial safety experience or whatnot. Hopefully there was (/will be) a safety review after everything that happened this video. Nobody was hurt, but maybe take this as a learning opportunity and review some safety procedures. Many of the things done on the channel are inherently dangerous (impossible to eliminate all danger), but small changes can be done to make things less dangerous.
Who labeled the "nitro button" , "E-stop" ?
I didn’t know Blender could do such good CGI particle effects. You have corridor crew help you on this one or something?
I can't wait to see v2. 0 of this. So long as you guys do a full rework of your safety checks and procedures. Watch Destin on Smarter Every Day. His bullet collision and supersonic baseball cannon video will show you what kind of safety standards you need to have for these amazing deathtraps you guys are making. I'd love to keep watching your shenanigans for a long time😊.  Also, does the engineer/manufacturer of this have a build video? It'd be super interesting to see how they make these things.
My first new video since subscribing a week and a half ago! I’ve been binge watching a lot of this channel
Speed set to 0😂
So much landfill waste
Now time to put a thousand cats in it😊
Well that was dramatic!
I’ll take “Stuff lawyers wouldn’t let happen in America” for $1,000, Alex.
15:22 AZ-5 didn't work on Chernobyl either
(my reaction) HOW RIDICULOUS
This one was actually ridiculous. Just as the channel starting to flatline you whip this one out
Some genuine panic there.
"The Gang Become Death, Destroyer of Worlds"
Shout out to Michael. Man's a legend.
😊
only an Australian can comfortably flick a spider😅
Why is this shit so sick 😫
How HR makes their money:   1: buy an item 2: brutally destroy it 3: sell the item
Will! it! blend!
The blend-tec blender guy would be proud
З першого погляду це весело, але хлопці, давайте будемо щирими, ви виробляєте таку купу сміття ради яких ся забав. Ви ж самі (звідкіля ви там, Нова Зеландія чи Австралія, не пам'ятаю) з регіону де є великий бар'єрний риф і який потребує допомоги. Лише для цього відео виробили понад тонну сміття. Це безвідповідальність. Unlike. Disgusting. Shame.
Power should go through contactor and e-stop should stop contactor from pulling.
just imagine the size of the fruits to put in the blender.
Lucky boy that education is obviously not needed to make shredder videos
Thumbnail is very clickbait.
The fact is that is an Australian spider, which means it has killed more people than your average Navy Seal
Now you guys can make the world's largest smoothie
so guys i love your videos but this might be going a bit too far in terms of what  is safe content. I know others have already stated this below but there were many failure points in this episode. You carried on with broken polycarb, and even stood outside your safe zone of the container during the next tests. There should also have been multiple points where you can cut power with e-stops and everyone should have been given a safety briefing on where those E-stops are so they are able to act in an emergency. What if the only person who knew about the E-stops was the one who was injured or could'nt get to it in time or safely. On top of using E-stops you should also have a tag lockout procedure in place so that when you are doing anything to the machine it cannot physically be turned on, even if power is connected. I understand you guys trust the team around you not to do anything stupid but it is never worth the risk of someones life. Finally though please guys get some safety gear, at the very least get some safety glasses  and safety hats.  Sorry to moan about this but i have seen and been in workplace accidents that could have been avoided by simple safety procedures and i do not want this to happen to any of you guys. I want to see many more videos of you guys having fun.
best content i have ever seen!!!!
when you are called to do something, you will do, surfboards surf
Where's the phantom slow-mo camera when you really need it.
Would have made th video a MILLION times more interesting if they tossed in one of those cows...........
Put a mannequin in...
0:57 the giant blender reminds me of those happy wheels levels
Nice to see Dave Grohl's joined the team
As someone who used to work in a millwork and cabinet making shop..I've NEVER heard a more terrifying set of words than "the e-stop isn't working"
Definitely one of the best ideas you've had. Also very well built and executed!
7:24
I want you guys to get a lot of yogurt, milk and fruits and make a giant milkshake
when are you planning to start human trials?
Did they take this idea from an old cold ones video?
The fridge in the blender needs to be a shirt
Aren't thermal runaways fun😅
You should make a big whirlpool generator and drop orbezz in
This idea was cool I enjoyed it
only you guys could come up with so many entertaining destructive uses for a big ass 3 phase motor.
Need a ballistics zombie in there
Well, that was... frightening.
Loved it more more more!!!
totally don’t see this going wrong in anyway at all
Loser of rock paper scissors gets blended
where can i sign up to do this
I think that green button they were pressing to start the blender was just a prop and it didn't do anything. I could be wrong though not sure.
محتوى أسطوري 😍😍legendary content🇩🇿🇩🇿🇵🇸
theres a hole in the blender, dear Liza dear Liza
I just watched Oppenheimer and the parallels between what these guys are doing and how excited the ppl were after dropping the first nuke are very interesting 😊
what would the cows be thinking?
Those cows would be completely scared for their lives or super  confused!
I work for a company that repairs and sells big electric motors like that and we have a bunch in stocks from last a few years ago that a brand new sitting on the shelf in their crates still I would be interested in knowing the horse power and RMP for the one you guys have I can likely get you a much bigger one for next to nothing and we are talking motors that were almost 100k to our clients
I've never seen a smoothie like this before
That was terrifying! Not sure if it was scarier than the sword one, but it was certainly scary. Thanks for sharing!
What a job. 😂😂😂
Can't wait for part2 ❤
Will it blend... DELUXE EDITION!!!
I'm sad I was too slow to get a club head. But I bought 3 golf balls that were in the blender. My wife thinks I'm crazy. And she's right.
This also has spoon stuck in the garbage disposal vibes, can’t get enough I’ve watched it like 6 times already 😂
Drop a cow in it lol
So for easier clean up put some plastic on the ground all around it so you can just pick it up and dump it.
dude can't spell psycho, but you let him fiddle with the power box under the motor.
He found those golf clubs at cashies for sure @dankpods
“We do think about our safety”
Can u sign th golf balls
Blended? Blent.
Dont Breathe this!.........
And I though the myth busters were insane earlier 😂😂😂😂😂😂
OK this is an awesome one!
That E-Stop failure was Psiyco!
Need to add an 11 to the dial, so you can turn it up to 11
I do have to say as a LONG TIME fan "Well thats not in one piece anymore." Was the best one liner that I've ever heard...ever!!!
Awesome Fun, Thanks!
The E-stop input of the VFD is a courtesy signal from the E-stop system to tell it to shut down gracefully, and should NOT be used as the actual means of shutting down the motor. (That's what motor contactors are for)  From the limited info presented is enough to determine a possible scenario - the unventilated VFD enclosure caused it to shut down through either overtemperature or overcurrent before these settings were increased to allow it to continue for the video.  The golf balls put a large load on the motor and VFD which then overheated both units. The motor started smoking in this instance and the VFD went into a fault state and turned itself up to 11.  The fact nobody knew that the generator had its own E-stop shows that these boys really need to think long and hard about the way they do things.  If you are earning enough money to build these amazing contraptions, you have enough money to hire a safety consultant.
That’s huge!
your group is falling apart, arent you
I love you guy's. This was one one of the worst you've done so far.  You're just farming content at this point.
HOW RIDICULOUS IS THIS 😂
Great video guys...KEEP GRINDING
Yikes, the end was quite scary😳
Danger level 11/10.. ain’t nothing coming out there
Each video these guys litter the world with more micro plastics than a normal person in a year...
can you throw all the ✡in there?
biggest ball washer world record 😮
ohh yeah we could probably fit like 50 furries in there
"And the winning Powerball numbers are..." 4:49
Golf balls were a bit anti climactic to be honest, fridge freezer was good though
woooow you realy almoste fried the blender hehe  cant wait to see the part 2 ;)  awessome video boys ;)
Live pigs please.
Who on earth would stand in this! 🤣
Don't breathe this.
I thought  the cow at the start was someone counting down 😂
"Don't breathe this".
You couldn't have at least tried the world's biggest blended margarita or something before you destroyed it? A bit of advice. If you try to fill that with actual margarita you might want to invite a LOT of people. 😂 OK in edit I guess you didn't destroy it. Yet... 👍💪
They missed the opportunity to put (GONE WRONG) in the title💀
I bet the turbo mode made it unstoppable
You should make a bigger blender and put a car in it
blend the only thing the original "will it blend channel" was always too scared to try...       crowbars
You may need to make the world’s biggest vacuum cleaner.
Make it stronger and drop a car in it 🔥🔥🔥
Dont imitate the BlendTec blender now :p
What do you do with the shredded plastic?
we can’t stop it 🗿
You guys should make a giant shredder like what they use to process scrap metal. Use it to shred a car or something
can you to melbourne
Giant smoothie time I think.😂😂😂😂😂
E-stop is not working 😱
Am I the only one thinking this is a terrible human-blending machine?
best idea yet with the heli
Can anyone remember that old YouTube channel years ago called Will it blend ?
now that i know a giant blender like this can be made, I'ma make one and try to get it registered as a "defensive Home Security System" Also next time ya'll know to double the size and power of the generator and the motor to make it more effective
How many people asked themselve - How will it looks with a ballistic dummy 1 to 1 human inside??
Idk what it is but there's something sus about the button 🤔
Here, that would be a VFD variable frequency drive
Put the tungsten cube put the tungsten cube inside :D
Even surfing is extra dangerous in Australia. It went straight from surfing to snowboarding in a second.
I love these guy’s accent!
"The E-stop didn't work."  Is easily the most terrifying sentence I've heard in a long time.  In the future it might be smart to have the extension cable connection within reach in the bunker so that if something similar happens you can quickly just rip the plugs apart without exposing anyone to potential shrapnel.   I also really wanted to see that kayak go in there. 😞
Imagine dropping a massive bud of ganja in an having a massive smoke up with the fans 😂😂😉
blend the cow?
Jeeeezz What can't you build? Cus I love It.
Make a giant smoothie
I want to see a 1 ton concrete block.
This is amazing
Well... as you all like to say... Absolutely mental!! 🤣
50 coconuts would be pretty cool to watch.
i see cashies made some money.
Screens are made of toxic material... safety first @how ridiculous
Has to be the best thing you’ve done 😎
paint powder please!  #44
That would be a perfect SAW trap
Oh no - Error 56!
"what just..... HAPPENED!?!"   best machine yet!😂
Okay so it's been a while for a world record..... Blending the world's largest milkshake. 🙂
Mad. How are these guys still alive?
This was INTENSE! For part 2 I will be needing popcorn and beta blockers.
Part 2: How to make an giant Blender explode
My guess is there are bigger industrial "blenders" than this one.
The best vid ever. Love it
Those blades are going faster than the speed of sound. If one of the blades would become loose it would fly right through the glass it would be insta death if you would get hit sounds like fun
Do ballistic gel  dummies
E stop was also a useless prop
Reckon you might have cooked the output regulation on the genset with a little too much current draw there boys! By far the most wicked machine you have built to date! Proper mental! Awesome video! Could not stop laughing!
WILL! IT! BLEND!
Ballistic dummy torso.. though I think that’s a bit much for this channel. Would be awesome though 🤣
I love it
these guys get kinda annoying for how over hype they get but vids just to entertaining
THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE!!! OMFG >>> !!!!! .... I love it.
THAT.   WAS.   AWESOME!   MORE!
next put real human in to the blender and see if its so powerful ;)      JK
This video was amazing guys, cannot wait for part 2, you killed it with this idea!
You need a pulley and fly wheel on it so it can have a little bit of slack on it but also more weight behind it
Maybe in Australia, 'Psyco' is spelled correctly :P
Where has this vid been all my life?
For TURBO, hit the E-STOP? Awesome, by the way.
That was fantastic guy's,  greetings from Benjamin from the Netherlands 🇳🇱
Terrifying.
I love all y’all’s videos but this one was the best one in a while super cool hopefully it will work and not break after one video
I rlly wanna start surfing I could have had it 🥲
E-Stop is not working. My god for anyone doing stuff with machines that is genuinely worse than "Nuke inbound"
Imagine having an emergency power cutoff switch that... asks software to perform an emergency power cutoff. Genius. And look how much they spent on a nice computer interface! Haha.
10:19 "This one goes to eleven"
That farm is now a toxic waste site.
This is the coolest thing you guys have ever done!!!!!   Awesome!!!!
Golfballs = biggest disappointment, haha :D
Who knew watching various items instantaneously deconstruct would be so wonderful
16:13 Dimples Galore would be a great stripper/porn star name!
U need to do a video on what went wrong and how the system is all connected I bet u get a lot of comments that will help not let that happen again and improve your big toys
I asked myself ``will it blend´´ .... and it did :DDDD
The e-stop did not e-stop.  Oh dear.
How painful or painless a death would this be?
At first I poo-hoo'd.  And then I poo-poo'd.
Leg rope....
They’re basically challenging themselves with every video to come up with the most gruesome way to execute a YouTuber.
2:16 Cause its a surfboard?... ;)
“What are you watching” Not much just some guys blending their fridge
and today in. Will it blend
You have 18,5M subscribers, but this guy is literally unlettered...this is the world we live in...🤦‍♂️
No Rexy's on the blender ? How ridiculous !
This has got to be the best thing these blokes have ever done
you should put 10000 cats in that thing
Guys, everyone knows, when you write turbo in sharpie, it overrides the e-stop button, it's science!
Give this thing to mr beast and he will have someone dropped in it for 100k or something.
Best how ridiculous video I’ve ever seen!
I think you need to take Scott to the doctor. He may have had multiple strokes throughout the course of this video XDDD
When you think they couldn't make anything else.. 😅
Just put a v8 engine in that thing. No more stops, just keep blending just keep blending just keep blending.
14:50 was time to panic lol.
"Lord, if it's my time, I'll see you soon." 🤣🤣🤣🤣
😅
That is scary..
So many times I expected a “Will it Blend” reference, but I didn’t get it…
Now drop a  ______?
That vsd must have had a hell of a time with the change in loading
I was so glad that Rexie didn't ride the surfboard for it's last ride. It would have been psiyhco.
Just don't imagine two people stuck in a blender just to go home.
Were are the proper slowies?
thanks for not talking too much and keep it going
You guys should try and make a machine the spins golf drivers kinda like the katanas but the hit a golf ball in a big hole
for jeebus sake! do NOT let people go into the giant blender?! ar you crayzi?!!!
That’s so cool
Can I recommend a lock-out/tag-out for when blender maintenance is happening?
Why did the first thing that came to mind was happy wheels
You should do a video where you don't mention god.
This is THE NEXT BEST SHIT!!! HOLY!!!!
Did the green and red buttons do anything?
An insane number of Ready Whip canned whipped cream would be great in this thing.
Making the whole thing sticky with fruit, THEN adding tennis ball fluff, may not have been the best idea :D  Love your work fellas, God bless :)
Why is there only an estop. There should be a hard isolator. It seems that some one designed the safety circuit incorrectly or wrote the PLC code wrong. Also all bigger generators in Australia have an e stop.
i litterly said the next one should be a giant blender in the last video this is so much more fun to watch XD
Das so was von geil klasse Qualität ihr seit die besten...
When will we get Psiycho Blender shirts? I need it
As a surfer the surfboard hurt my heart, cool vid though
OMG!!! That was EPIC, and FIN awesome. I want more.
Beauty day for it...I love the creative destruction, only irked by the rare religious reference...honestly any deity would want you all to do something entirely...else...like for people who need stuff. And I know west AU isn't a very diverse place, but please just once invite a woman, asian, aboriginal, anyone not a white man, out for a shoot...keep up the nonsense guys, and keep it about the ridiculous, and get a dog up ya, cheers
Hold on mates, When i clicked dislike i got a notification that Facebook shared my action with you the creator.  Ummm, I watched this on the Youtube, What the tits is going on there?  Is Facebook buying out Youtube?  They best not be.
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😊
The belt was slipping causing the smoke.
You should make your E-stop not just tell the VSC "Speed zero, please" but instead cut power to it.
One video, one show!!!!!!!
My dudes, we’ve been watching and supporting a long time, but this one really is insanely dangerous. No more please.
Sellouts. Don't turn into those guys, please?
I haven't Audibly laughed in a while before this. Thanks, guys!
Is there a technician in the the field ? 🐄 E-Stop not working is a huge design flaw.
Time to make it water tight and make the world's largest milkshake the record is 23 years old time for a new record holder
Guys blended a fridge. Let that sink in
Might want to put the end of the extension cable right next to the safety crate opening for ease of access to unplug it.
I would like to see what would happen if you put all of the debris into the blender at the end.
pure carnage, you boys going full balls out
Please put some new t-shirt, hats and sunglasses in the merch store PLEASE!!!
Psycho setting was fitting there....  The machine got a mind of it's own and went crazy.
That surf board fought, went for one last ride
You almost opened a wormhole with that speed!
The machine in your content, if used to grind fruit is even more interesting
Worst case😂
Oooof Blender Smoke, Dont breath that!
who else was watching Will It Blend way back in the good ol days, sixteen years ago?
This is top 5 best YouTube videos ever.
For some reason this gives me strong happy-wheels vibes. Lol
The E-stop made it worse, like the AZ-5 at Chernobyl!
When the blender does not turn it off it reminds of Chernobyl when they cant turn off the reactor then boom!
You are wrong. You do not know about safety. While somebody is inside the blender, that person needs to possess the only key for a locking device that covers the cord cap preventing the cord from being plugged in while that person is inside the blender.
Will it blend a small car?
Look like diesel engine runaway
Fire extinguisher , will it blend 😮
3 TVs ago is like 25 years for me 😂😂😂
I feel very much as if How Ridiculous is directly competing with Mr. Beast and Mark Rober with projects these days. I 100% support healthy competition for my entertainment.
That's what a tornado does to a whole house.
a sign from god
Best video in a long time, carnage, excitement, panic, thrills, 🏄‍♀️.  Part 2 should be epic also #44 club
I defo think the murch should say…WELL THATS NOT IN 1 PIECE ANYMORE What Gornson said when the bowling ball smashed on the dam. Brilliant video as always.
This was one of the best videos I’ve ever seen. Hands down. Soo entertaining! Pls do more of these giant blender ones!
Ok this was mental, love your work gentleman, stepped out up a notch for sure 🤘
Poor spider
The golf balls are too Heavy. You are better off using Ping Pong balls for better effect.
the end was crazy good video :)
Best "Will It Blend" video ever!
I’ve always wanted to do this as a kid
yeahhhh. that failure at the end is why u need a hard stop. aka, a complete power disconnect.  please stay safe guys
Yehhhhh…… after that I wouldn’t want you guys to stand in there ever again, please don’t 😩
you guys are awesome. one day you will team up with elon musk and rocket the moon back to earth 😂
I used to use something called "Naxel Policarb". It was almost indistructable, didn't shatter or crack. Could bend it 180 degrees and still would not snap. If you can get that it will definately worh for your blender
Kids: remember to test Estops before you do dangerous stuff.
Good reminder to everyone about the wondrful law of one Edward A. Murphy. Aka "Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong". Failsafes are excellent, have as many of them as you can, but failsafes can fail so best prepare to when they do!  No power n the blender is a pretty sure-fire failsafe though 😅
I love how their titles and thumbnails look like a clickbait when in reality it's not also... Well that's not in one piece anymore
Bender Blitz to the Max. He certainly chews them up. The golf boys looked liked you were blending eggs.
At this time when the video released early, I wonder what the most replayed part of the video will be in the near future
The absolute best video you guys have ever done and there have been some bloody crackers. ❤🎉
One fine morning, one of these lads woke up and thought, I want to blend a fridge.
Just need to add some milk or water
What a spectacular vid idea! Top tier content boys 👍 I was a bit worried about your audience [ 🐄🐄🐄 (cows) ] getting hurt by stray debris that popped out the top of the blender, but it looks like they backed up once ya’ll got started
Such a waste of resources... 😞
The golf balls bit was TERRIFYING. I loved that though, keep doing awesome stuff like this and please dont ever stop!!!
Slow-mo guys collab with How ridiculous. They've got super slow-mo cameras.
spectacular concept. phenomenal execution. pshyco/10
Don't breath this!
It's nice to know they do have adult supervision!
The blender spinning up reminds me of the GTA San Andreas intro!
that was crazy!!!!!!! i love it!!!!!!!!!!more,more,more!!!!!!!!!
3:10 the blades spin so fast to the point where it looks static yet illusional
please drop one of those zombie bodies in from ballistic dummy labs.  although it probably will be demonetized. since YouTube and thier advertisers hate creativity
A dead sheep/pig/cow needs to be dropped on full speed
The carnage!😂
I know they are surprised it blended so many things, but this is basically what happened at one point at every trash collection point
14:50 This is what it means...to go *even further beyond!*
Hearing the RPMs increase after the emergency stop was activated was terrifying.
Best bit of Drama yet! Glad you're all safe!
Surfs UP, Baby!!!
Was the E-STOP a software E-STOP?
This entire channel is basically my 9 yo son's imagination come to life.  Both highly entertaining and scares the daylight out of me.
I don't come here for cliffhanger endings; I come here to immediately find out what happens to a bowling ball when it fails to hang on to the cliff!
You guys missed a trick, should have written Ludicrous Speed on that dial... And for those that don't know, just Google ludicrous speed
Fender service star disks tver its crud but blend all guitars. DONT blend the banjo you break the indy fx chv start the US
what a mayhem ❤
With such great content quality I think these guys will soon reach Mr beast’s level…. A giant shredder would be interesting for a future video…
Holy shirt ball mates, this thing is is unreal. So good.  Best thing you've done since the tower IMO.  Lots of cool stuff of course, but this is next level.
You guys have the best job in the world, for science!
Peak male entertainment (for the boys?)
you guys really should start getting those realistic ballistic dummies for these
Boys This is the best one ever 😂❤
You should do a wheelchair.
I love how that motor gave them infinite content 😂😂😂
This has massive youth pastor energy and I'm not ashamed to say it
famous last words: " I can't stop it!"
Looks like your gonna need bulletproof glass boys.😅
That surfboard rode one last wave with bravery... Surf on bro surf on
"Don't breathe this!"
I think the the belt is not tight enough, it got warm and stretched, then it slipped and got very hot. Since the blades continued to rotate despite the engine being switched off, the belt also continued to rotate while the engine slowed down. That's why the smoke went on. The engine has probably generated voltage and "pressed" it into the generator. An emergency stop has to cut the voltage circuits (load circuits) and not to stop the motor control like a "fast-stop".
step 1. make water tight step 2: make giant smoothie
Quote of the day, 'If there is one thing you don't put in your blender, it's a bowling ball.'
Where's Rexy?
How was it made? In Blender 😂
Them boys, well... will be boys
Disappointed nobody blended the spider
Senator Motortine: UNLIMITED.... POWAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Anakin Generator: 👿
Your machine is Sketch!
Throw 2 cows in there nice ground beef……man that’s evil isn’t it?🤦🏾‍♂️
The power of that motor is flipping insane
Now try it with a person.
can you try my ex wife next
Put the guy the put a cat in a blender in there bruh
The most impressive thing might be how they flicked the spider away without giving it a second thought. As if it was second nature
You spider-flicking, TV-murdering Ozzy man-children, can’t say I was not entertained.
I miss the tower, when are you going to do more fun stuff there????????
Jeez that ending was so scary. I'm no mechanic/machinist but you may have really cooked the motor and the failsafe not working is just a terrifying situation. Glad no one was hurt. Safety is absolutely paramount when doing things like this.  That being said, love the vid boys! This giant blender may just be the best ever thing you absolute mad blokes created for the channel.
খুব সুন্দর ❤❤ এত বড়ো মিক্সার গ্রাইন্ডার দেখিনি আমি ,,,,,,,,,,,,, আমি অবাক হয়ে গেছি 😱😱,,,,,,,,,,,🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
THIS IS AMAZING!!!
Not gunna lie best video in a while gents well done!
I just got hella Halo 3 flashbacks 😅
This might sound ridiculous but I think the blender took the PSIYCHO part seriously and went nuts and then it remembered it has to go TURBO so it started running even faster 😁
You know its a good vid when the first drop is exactly what you want.
WILL IT BLEND❔THAT IS THE QUESTION‼️  The stoppages wouldn't happen with a REAL BLENDTEC blender.
Been watching your channel for a while... This one... Is the ABSOLUTE BEST ONE YOU BOYS HAVE EVER DONE... BRAVO!!!
sounds to me like you need a physical disconnect between the genny and the blendy. one of them big throw levers.
please make milkshake in it
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
This has to be the most insane thing you guys have ever built, AND I LOVE IT!
You guys would make terrifying but well equipped super villains
This is the best video so far! 😁👍
You should put water in it and make a vortex
I thoroughly enjoyed this video.
So tennis balls are stronger than bowling balls?
Whoever came up with this idea is a f****** genius
this is obv fake, how do those slow spinning blades do that much damage?
This blender remind of the one from the simpsons episode 😅
Thought this video was going to suck. It didn’t.
Now we know what happens to the golf clubs Dankpods keeps seeing in Cashie's!
Next you all need to send ballistic dummys in
ah good, something even more terrifying then last time
That spider is the reason my ass is staying in Canada. 😅 forever.
Now make a smoothie.
I wonder what the cows were thinking when you were blending the most random stuff
This has to be the most entertaining one yet
someone should make a blender animation of that blend of blenders being blended in a big blender, so that way you could say "someone blended a blend of blenders in a blender and put it on blender, so now blender has a blend of blenders being blended in a blender"
Awe Man not the surf board 😮
YET ANOTHER LEVEL. Amazing idea awesome vid, the way the surf board went.  forward to part two with baited breath and pop corn. Stay safe guys atvb 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🦊
All I can say is WOW.  I'll say it backwards.  WOW.
Well this is the most terrifying contraption I've  ever seen...
Thank you, for always being so entertaining.
This is both brutal and beautiful. Some might even say “Brutiful”
As a Florida man, i can confirm this is our average breakfast routine.
First 2 items in and I'm already thinking to myself this is epic......might be my favorite build yet!!
Honestly I don't know how the teenagers put up with the high pitch squeal that the blender puts off. Somebody in the audio department needs to do a frequency clipping at about 14 k or lower to keep the high squeal down.  Seriously had to turn the audio off in order to save my Gen X ears
I'm pretty sure the construction of this device violates the geneva convention.
On a scale from 1 to Oh shit we're dead, how scarred were you guys when the blender wouldn’t stop?
Imagine if that E-stop glitch had occurred when someone was inside mucking it out.
Im sorry but you guyd regularly distroy useful perfectly good things sometimes but i honestly believe you destroyed the worlds best surfboard.
We are live and N the field
That was almost like a runaway turbo diesel...   Runaway diesel is super scary...
PLEASE, no more spelling with Gaunson!  It’s too painful.
Im normally on board for the haphazard builds yall come up with, though some definitely push the bill a bit far... none have every really gone into the realm of "actually potentially lethal" before. And not even a "do not try this at home" warning... Look i love the craziness randomness too yall, ive been here a LOOONG time and have loved every video, from the origins of rexy, to the amazing boat flip and exploding bowling ball, even to the dart skipping videos of old. But this... was the most dangerous thing we have ever seen them do. And that is not hyperbole. This literally couldve killed everyone on that site in seconds had it gone differently. Those golf clubs were mostly metal... and we SAW them go through plexiglass. One stray hit is all it would take for one of those heads to go through their barricade. Thats the last thing any of us want. We want you boys to be safe, especially because this is often seen by THOUSANDS of children. Making children curious about the world around them is great and seeing the physics of stuff at work is some of the most amazing things we can share with our children to teach them... but this was just too dangerous. If a child gets the idea to try to blend one of these items themselves (smaller or otherwise) it could turn deadly QUICKLY. I dont wanna be a killjoy, I just think some serious safety overhauls are DESPERATELY in order here. Someone definitely needs to be held accountable even if no serious accidents happen, a fault of that nature can not ever ever happen again, because it could turn deadly next time or worse... cause a serious fire. That would be terrible on an even larger scale.
This might be the most scared they have looked since the beginning of the channel! I was feeling their fear! Glad the boys are ok and everything is ok!
Giant blocks of colors ice would have been really cool too 👍
It would be epic if they blend a blender wich was blending a blender wich was blending a blender wich was blending a blender and so on
I reckon the smoke underneath the blender was the belt slipping
You guys should make a huge see through wood chipper
I have a blender tattoo. I should have been in the video lol
Giant blender is both pure joy and pure terror. Beautiful machine.
Best One Yet! More of these for sure! Try Tool Steel for the blades might last longer
Best version of the spin machine yet!!!!!
Will it blend - that is the question - don’t breathe this.
Leave it up to these guys the make something incredibly terrifying. I think it might be a good way of getting rid of a body. The hamburger maker 9000.😬👌
You know the person that put a cat in a blender? we should put that person inside of this massive blender
The blender heard you talking sh*t about it and said "i will blend"
need a new refrigerator?
the microplastic generator 10,000,000
It is always a good idea to have an easy and quick way to cut power to any dangerous machinery. It is not uncommon for many emergency stop systems to do exactly that. I'm glad nothing got too out of hand!
I’m a simple man. I see giant blenders turning things into shrapnel and dust, I click the like button. 👍
Best video yet boys
The whirlwind of destruction.
I thought it was gonna explode
People next 😂
Awesome video guys. One of your best.
The giant blender is inspired!
Optical illusion of the blades turning the wrong way ... I had to slow it down to double check.
PSIYCHO - has to be a T-shirt for sure.  Little I and little H, or maybe just the print of the text Gaunson wrote at 13:13.
great, another load of products made just go right to land fill, good one
how good!!!!!
Damn, my heart was in my mouth there for a bit at the end.  When an e-stop fails, something is going wrong.  All good in the end, phew. 😅
Y’all should do a ballistics dummy
Farmer joe ,would not have been happy,if his livestock got hurt.
You don’t learn English you memorize it is amazing
Dropping a refridgerator into a giant blender is the epitome of this channel.  Tough beating that one.
Yes, lives up to the channel name.
They built an actual Saw trap
Drop a human in there
Yk that ending was scary enough to be the first truly iconic moment in quite a while
How Ridiculous , Maybe you can out do Bland Tec by dropping in crowbars which Blend Tec failed to blend; they also failed to blend diamonds.
ngl ending feels staged. estops designed to cut power no matter what..
How do you guys clean all of that stuff up?
Like Tombstone in a glass closet !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow, I think this is your best video yet, maybe put rexy in a safe next time
That was awesome.  Definitely looking forward to more blender videos. :D   May want to fix the E stop though, set it up so it physically breaks the connection to the motor. I guess contactors rated for that kind of power are hard to find though.
The fridge and the TV!  OMG!  Those were SO VIOLENT!
@colinfurze I smell a challenge  Bigger Blender
.... drop a gel dummy 😱
The physics of a blender is the liquid heat
Not sure if this is a little outlandish, but if you set up some air nozzles under it (like an air hockey table) you could really get some bits going, eh? Might be too much trouble to be worth it or could be a killer upgrade. Bless you fellas and your team!
Not going to lie this thing is terrifying.
That was amazing
Them: Look at that spider  Me: Look at that camera quality
Talk about a cliff hanger!
I want an item to go in and it is so solid it freezes the blender blades so the blender then jumps around instead
World's largest Milkshake coming right up? =D
I love how editor Jack just slowly becomes more and more the 4th person in the group 😂
This is awesome! Great idea and video. And I do not want to be a Debbie downer at all... But have you guys ever considered that there is a ton of fine particulates in the air in and around that thing when you open it that you REALLY should not be breathing? Because there is, I promise you.
Blending the blenders was awesome
Do you want to go faster??
im sure this was the easiest cleanup after the video ever
i bet the belt was just getting cooked that was alot to ask for of it. if you would of started it and dropped the balls in wouldnt of had that problem. but the e stop is a big problem.
If you have the VSD on max, that's why it's tripping. At that sort of speed, any restriction of the blades will result in over-current.  Just calm down lads and turn it down a bit :)
orbeez.
Make it have a spigot on the bottom and make the worlds largest smoothie, I’d love to join for that video!! 🎉
Yall should make a giant smoothie
Love how this whole channel’s premise is just guys being dudes
the golf clubs was the best. looked so good from inside just like a tornado 🌪!!
I have to say I love the destruction but I’m afraid for the cows that they may get a piece of metal or other stuff
Ooh, Imagine having a new channel character, Rexy’s nemesis, Error 56. The evil golf ball pursuing Rexy to stop his stunts.
Can't get over the fact that your emergency mechanism went full Chernobyl: accelerating the reaction instead of stopping it dead right after pressing the EMERGENCY STOP button 😂😂😂
This is why I've been subscribed to the channel for so many years! Exactly when you think what more could they do they've outdone themselves this time for sure, the come up with something as mind blowing as this! Absolute legends! 🙌
I really needed that tv bro
Can’t wait for part two  Lovn the blender when on a bender
Welcome to "Will it blend" XXXL.😁Fantastic Video!
i assume your e stop is going to the vfd and sending a command to request stop, would be better to use a contactor to break main power instead. that way if the vfd is erroring out or someone sets it to ignore faults the machine still terminates operation
Ridiculous, now time to put the giant Lego Death Star or the like in the blender. Just thinking about it hurts my soul.
hopefully ya'll kept the 10 iron. that one is unique.  what was Scott holding before "The Gigantic Blender" was turned on??  I would like to have that 10 iron!!
Next time....throw a blastic gel in the grinder 😂😂
but are the Cow's safe?
You guys should dye some blocks of ice different colors and see how it looks.
Livestock gonna get metal in their hooves you can see sharp metal flying out no bueno boys. 😢
6:07 “oh noru… OH NORU…”  *BANG*
About the fridges. Do you guys take out the cooling system/fluids before destroying them? Bevriest those fluids/gasses are terrible.
How can you afford to do this could you front me 20$ lol jk love the content
Is it a good idea to blend this?  Let's find out!
Should have tried bouncy balls! I bet they would have slowly blended
That cow sounded like it had an Aussie accent!
As one of the LOUDEST channels i love on youtube, I love you guys. I have watched your channel with my kids from the beginning. You never cease to make me smile. After a stressful day, I have a smile on my face. Thank you 44. What if you guys made a giant slingshot? or a giant Rexi with crushing jaws. idk. LOVE FROM NY mait hahahahahaha
Oh, the boys have found a new viral series 👁️👄👁️
Absolute Mad Lads
I'm usually impressed by all your build but I can't tell why, this one is the one that impress me the most ! Cant wait to see the next episode !  Ps : Hope you clean everything for the cows to be safe ! Greeting from a long time French fan ✌
Love your guys content. I’m a fan from the states. I gotta say the one thing thing I’ve always liked about y’all’s channel is, the content you guys create comes second to y’all just chilling vibing and doing ridiculous stuff. It’s just friends shooting the shit.
you guys deserve more
U mental maniacs
You guys should fill the blender halfway up with water and slowly add food colouring to it and watch as it combines inside!
Blend children to raise awareness against child labour
You all need to travel to Texas and shoot stuff with Matt!  That would be an epic post for you both!!!
Genuinely, how does E-Stop not work? Isn't it suppose to just physically cut the power?
Looks like Texas has a new option for the death penalty. 😂
Where are the slowies?
You lads are absolutely psychotic......  And I love it.....
A much nicer and professional way to dispose big Rubbish 🗑 😮
Wow who would think these good clean Christian men are so creatively destructive. You guys are amazing
These ninja bullet commercials are getting out of hand
If you have a really good reaction (like to the fridge) you should show it by itself first. That's what the slow-mo guys do, and it's great.
As a golfer I find the golf clubs being blended extremely hard to watch.
Love the commitment to community opinion. I honestly thought this would be too RIDICULOUS for you guys to actually do, but I guess that's the name of the game for you guys
That was psiycho!
6:12 my favourite saying of all time 😂
How many electrical cords were wrapped around the shaft?
This thing is absolute chaos LMAO
14:07 Great balls of fire
That monstrosity gives me anxiety. It’s so scary.
This was on Dr. Evil's list right after those sharks...
Will it Blend? That is the Question.
The surfboard surfing on blades and then getting totally pitted was epic!
Future ideas use multi color bouncy balls or multi color tenis balls better slowmo and pleaseing to the eye
Golf Ball dust, don't breath this!
U should,do like a microwave or something that melts stuff I think it would be interesting to watch
When future archeologists find all the boys' toys it'll be used as proof of giants lol
Your controller board should have a seperate backup power circuit like from a battery, if it was working too hard there's a much greater chance for errors to happen as the motor steals all the amps for spinny time
15 out of 10 😊
Put the cow in there
How do you find the people to make a giant custom blender this blows my mind what type of company would you even go to
that was a pretty wild ending haha
Those who don’t come from TikTok are allowed to like this…
You gotta get a ballistic gel dummy to put in there.
I think this has got to be the most terrifying deadliest machine yet, there's no escaping once you're dropped in 😆
Editing??  Why are the words "Psycho" and "Turbo" written on speed control dial before golf balls are added.  Then when golf balls are blending the words are NOT there?  How Curious 🤘😎
Golf ball was designed to sustain massive impact and survive.  It did. I think you guys cooked the disconnect for the E-stop when you go max load.  It's probably welded together.
WOOOOOOW the golf balls Looked so much fuller on your video link…a little clickbaity
This is up there with my fav viddies hr has ever produced
3rd law = happy.
Guys, please hire a controls engineer.
Why though?!?😅 Because you're thinking of things we'd wanna do.
Pitch this idea on Shark Tank 😂
One thing I've learned is that if these guys can't break it, then the item is indestructible
My favorite one so far Mates!!! Cheers 🍻
World largest blender… now all we need is to make the world’s largest smoothie
Edit: saw a slowy 🥳  I’m 6:48 minutes in, not seen one slowy (I don’t think) hopefully there are some as I continue watching
In the future, it might be prudent to have a power cut-off inside the bunker in the form of a circuit breaker.
I enjoy most videos, however, this one leaves me wondering about the amount of debris being slung into the field... where the cows graze… that is irresponsible. Did you clean it up? Call me “Karen” or call me carin’ (caring) lol, please do better 🌏
Freaking great VID!
Those walls of the blender do not look thick enough, christ the surfboard made it rattle lol  Also I don't care how many cables are disconnected, I would never stand in there next the blades, brave lads
10 out of 10 For the surf board. Put up a good fight!
Will it blend? That is the question.
My favorite part of this is the cows just casually grazing in the background while everything is getting absolutely destroyed in the blender 😂
Test your estop on level one.   But if your contacts on the relays over heated and welded themselves.  That may be why it didn’t shut off and why it sped up.  Took the full load lol.  Cool none the less.
They figured out the weakness of their spinning machines was that it pushed the objects away before cutting it much. This is quite an ingenious way to prevent that.
They missed the opportunity to put 44 on the dial lol
I haven't got to the end of the video yet but it would be REALLY cool to see all these in reverse!
It's video's like this that resonate with a channel name like "How Ridiculous" .. This is absurd, and for a couple friends and a team of people to build this highly technical blender, safety precautions, disposal, ect. that is a ridiculous amount of work, to blend absurb objects, in a blender. that looks like a blender. pretty crazy day of the week. can't say I have one lined up like that.
You have an opportunity here to go for a world record largest smoothie with this machine
Where else can you see a fridge get blended 😂
So theoretically, if I were to jump in there while it was on…
😮😮😮 WHAT IF YOU MAKE A GIANT POPCORN MAKER AND FILL A POOL WITH IT OR SOMETHING
The blender is reminding me of Bmg-drive and i love that
I think I found a new way to chop up the body😵
How about 200 stuffed animals? Or a human sized dummy, made of forensic gel with a skeleton inside, water balloons for organs (gotta fill one with oatmeal for the stomach), noodles for the brain... Ambitious, I know. But it would be neat.
I just got back from getting fillings done at the dentist and for whatever reason, I was SUPER sensitive to the bowling ball lol.
ТЫ ВЫБИРАЙ АД ИЛИ РАЙ
“We have multiple fail-safes in place. We think about safety.”   Ten minutes later.   “The E-stop is not working!”
One of your best videos yet :)
BEST ONE SO FAR !! Try to donate some shit to needy people
Ridiculous built mate 😎
Something so incredibly poetic about the surfboard going for it's last ride, absolutely ripping waves in that blender. RIP, overwhelmingly Aussie surfboard. You were a legend.
Drawing too much power - like politicians during the pandemic.
O man that was crazy.
i never thought i'd see a refrigerator get blended
World's largest smoothie anyone?
Australians: can't own guns  Also Australians:
The E-stop was apparently also a prop!
dude says he didnt knew theres an e stop on the generator, man u dont even know how to write psycho. jezus
i knew turning that thing into a giant blender would be awesome
Need to do a collab with blendtech lol. “Don’t breathe this”
Taking “Well, that’s not in one piece any more!” to the logical extreme.
is that a blendtec blender
2:09 the surfboard got one last ride.
"That fridge blended surprisingly well" is not a thought I anticipated ever going through my mind.
E stop not working? That's supposed to be a failsafe!
I'm disappointed we didn't get a Science Time with Gaunson when he was checking out the VSD.
Does it go to 11 ?
Y'all should have got the Will it Blend guy from Blendtech
The last ride of the surf board was amazing 🎉🎉🎉
you guys should put a realistic ballistics gel mannequin and blend it
On this video of will it blend....
"Is he gonna write 'psalms'?"
All us Perth boy's are legends, If you agree give us a thumbs up👍
Hope you guys explain what happened to make it not stop in part 2 lol.
out of all ridiculous the stuff u guy have done i think this is the first time ive ever seen things get so serious. please keep making awesome stuff and stay safe guys
Would be pretty cool to see this in a collaboration with the Slowmo Guys!
I love the look on your faces, when the bowling ball hit the bottom of the dam, "well that's not in piece anymore" LMAO
How do you guys clean up at a location after you’re done after a shot like this?
Didn't see that coming 😂😂 now that's ridiculous
Blend a GoPro see if the chip survives
9:53 it pains me that we will never know how good michaels burger was
glad it didn't spin into infinity and fly away
You should make the world's biggest popcorn popper next.  LoL
0:30 may be that livestock was worried he will be put in next 😂
Now that what you call some well blended blenders!
This was so much better than I ever possibly could have imagined
This was too fun. Whoever thought of doing the blenders 1st is a genius!
YouTube has come full circle back to will it blend videos
Omg I,so really love,I guys your videos are the best I,can't wait for you,to,post look forward to,them I,share them so,everyone I know will.them so,thx again guy's
Will it Blend?  That is the question!
I have an odd feeling that this was really made for Squid Games 2.
Could you guys mantle a smoothie in there?
3:15 Bro is doing Happy Wheels in real life! 😂
Well done boys. This channel doesn't disappoint.
Didn't the show Big build a blender
The "Will It Blend" guy would be proud of this.
A whole new twist on the question, “will it blend?” 😳
OMG I think you guys just built the best machine for recycling...... 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉awesome and amazing video. Can't wait to see more.
That was awesome 😂😂
Please make like a five minute bonus vid of the tenis balls in the blender for an hour at least
E-stops should always fail off
Absolutely brilliant as usual
Turbo Psiycho!
Starting it 'under load' is never a good idea. Entertaining though.
Amazing how you keep outdoing yourself with these elaborate and terrifying machines.
that was awesome
BLEND BULLETPROOF GLASS
Y’all had a real life Chernobyl  moment…
You should blend a cow
I hated the whistling every time you started up but I stuck it out for you legends.
That was a definite ‘oh dear no’ moment there
Are there two speed dials? Because 14:00, no PSIYCHO and no  ⊣ ⊂ ᓓ ϖ o
Can we just take a moment to appreciate how these guys never click-bait us.
10:04 the spider just despawned
The ending was a straight up Chernobyl scenario
WILL IT BLEND
... entirely unrelated but do you guys think you could get a hold of a "donated to science" human corpse?  Again, *entirely unrelated*.
That cow knows the drill. Get the flipping BELL ON!
Cant stand when emergencies happen and people freeze instead of thinking and act accordingly.. maybe unplug the cord? Or just stand there frozen with a helpless blank look and let someone that can take stress while keeping their wits about them. Thanks EJ! Another ick.. PSYCO.. duhmmy
Car + Blender
i will be cool to see water but it all going to get what
The ending of this video was unhinged.
Bowling ball smoke, don't breathe this.
A fresh batch of micro plastic, how delicious
Will it blend? Boat? Mini? Caravan? The beginning of a beautiful thing. How good!
Well. that was crazy
F in chat for the spider
This was one of the most visually pleasing yet anxiety filled videos I've ever seen you guys make... I LOVED IT
Idea!  You should make a bowling ball size golf hole and launch the ball with a very large sling shot.  Make it a Par 5 or something and punish the loser.  Herron might actually stand a chance with this kind of golf!!!
You know. I alllllllllways wondered if you guys would go as far as to make a giant Blender. I had hope. Myd reams have been answered lmfaoooo. I fihgured it would simpoky be too dangerous to make. "THE E STOP ISNT WORKING" LOL FUCK. "I didnt even know the generator HAD an e stop" LOL WHAT YOU TURD. KNOW ALL SAFETY RULES BEFORE PROCEEDING lmfao. Ahhh too good. Love you guys.
Absolutely genius idea's  bring on more love it
"E-stop HAS to work."
The blender has to be the best mega machine designed yet! Can't wait for Part 2!
Lets see how close I can get... The VSD is powered by a generator and contolled by serial or bus over ethernet.  Someone mentioned the generator was smoking, so likely the problem originated there. Maybe some type of overvoltage issue if the excitor circuit failed. This could have caused extra harmonics on the communication line, disrupting the coms between the laptop and VSD. Or simply a converter in the communication line could have shut down due to the voltage problem from the generator. The E-stop was just on the laptop, so that would also have relied on the coms. Since the laptop was the control master, garbled data on the coms line could cause erratic behavior and possibly made it speed up, or, more likely, it wasn't at top speed yet and was still speeding up from a previous command.   Or possibly a bad power connection to the bat copter control cabinet could have caused the smoke and the coms failure.  Long story short, some sort of generator or connection malfunction caused a disruption in the communication line.
Will it blend, that is the question.
But will it blend?
as a sparky, you had a short on some of the switches
You guys have outdone yourselves!
Oh my! That was scary at the end, but it was your best video to date!
I don't know why they got scared. They're in a steel container.
If the blades were sharp it would dice up most those items 100
There is nothing I wouldn't pay to see Joe Biden fall in that blender by accident. Just saying
Will it blend would be very proud right now
box of either LIT or NON-LIT fireworks shall be dumped upon The Blendithina
𝑺𝑨𝑻𝑼𝑹𝑫𝑨𝒀🙄🎉🎉🎉🎉
Fruit blended in a blender. How is that disgusting ??? I also knew someone who said eating dry cereal is yucky. I’m still trying to figure that one out to.
i feel like a rope connected to the end of the power cord would be a good idea so you could give it a yoink to unplug it as a last resort. after all safety is more important then content so im glad yall are ok. AWESOME vid though, the ideas you guys have been coming up with lately are insanely cool, keep up the good work!
Those cows better watch out or they'll be blended too
this is the best episode of "will it blend?" i have ever seen
Blendtec’s will it blend has nothing on this.
I love all your videos. I’ve diligently watched you guys grow immensely in creativity over the last 4-5 years and love it. (I used to watch them as I rocked my newborn daughter to sleep, now she’s 4 and she calls you ‘the silly guys’ and we watch new videos before bedtime)   You guys are in peak form.
When it was still clean, you should have made the world's biggest smoothie, and had a legion of fans there to drink it.
When Doing these things out in paddock and causing a mess how about u guys do them In a Wearhouse paint the wall to whatever green and do a green screen making the back drop looking like you are outside
*Herron holding the TV*   "I reckon we drop this one-" right on his shin 😂
You blokes are cooked. A golf club head goes through the polycarb that easy and you’re standing outside during an overspeed condition. Those blades will remove your heads before you even know what happened when they fail.
thats cray
man i hope they start posting more, there is too much negativity on the internet, not enough ridiculousness
14:25 Almost had a resonance cascade there
It's damn near a tornado simulator lol
The blendtec guy is gonna have a fit about this I'm sure
that piece of sheet
Surf board smoothie, anyone?                                 (I’m joking.)
this is the best vid yet thank you. You make a day good
Thats like a contraption on the Saw movies.
The Blend Tech Will it Blend videos don’t have anything on this monster!
Can't believe you guys did this! You guys are nuts and I LOVE IT!
I think that defendant trump should be given the chance to throw himself into this instead of being prosecuted.
Just when I thought you couldn't come up with another way of causing mass destruction ... along comes Blender 44
Best thing ever!
I’m 3 min in and this by far the best use of this tool!!!
rip HR
Please study about stored unwanted energy- it can kill. You guys are working with energy and even though something stops it doesn't mean it's dead or lack of energy-
Gaunson! That bowling ball is definitely not in one piece anymore.
Turbo Plus!
can we just appreciate how much effort and money they put into these videos just for us ❤️
The fact the last the surf board surfed that was so cool
These mad lads just keep finding new ways to outdo themselves
Blend blenders
Will it blend? That's the question
in your next video can you put me in the bender?
Who's idea was it to keep in the high pitched ringing everytime it starts up. I cant be the only one who hates this.
I’d wager you would need at least 1 million golf balls to mirror the amount you filled the blender in the thumbnail.
This is by far the most diabolical creation the boys have built yet, gods help us all
10:38 can see bits flying out here
Definitely one of if not my favorite video
Super neat!
I live in Georgia in the US and I came here to say that your outdoor winter footage has saved me for today.  I am hot.  I am SO hot.  But I am alive and feel a little less hot because you guys and bundled and have red noses.  Thank you.
Tom Dickson would have been proud.
they shouldve done fruit first so they could eat it lol
That's actually true about the English language.  It's deliberately set up to separate the classes.  If you say a word "wrong" or spell it wrong, they know you're not in the club.  Chinese is actually one of the worst that was set up to keep the poor poor by restricting written language to the upper classes who could afford to learn it.
Great vid, great quality. I couldn’t stop smiling while watching this
Weak! Nobody needs an E stop.   You weren't even close to dying, you little girls.
my favorite so far in the "giant thingajig" series.   and the samurai sword helicopter is pretty hard to beat
You’ll should have bought a dead pig and put it In would have been interesting
The greatest last surf a board could ask for!
The channel should be called How Destructive
Easily the best use of the spinnernator so far
id replace those belts before vid 2. Those things have to be half melted. Awsome musheen.
Is that the actual sound of it spinning up or is that foley? If that's foley its a fantastic job.
That was a good blend of comedy and craziness, you spycos.
Let's take a moment to remember that this all started with some dudes throwing stuff off a tower for fun
These needs to be at the drop tower.
"The E-Stop is not working" are words you NEVER want to hear! I would be praying at that point. I'm glad it all worked out. How intense!
YouTube has gone full circle. We have made it back to “WILL IT BLEND!”
The e-stop not working was scary
You guys are awesome! Always finding something new and awesome!
HOW RIDICULOUS
Please put these in the blender if you wouldnt mind.  Tree Stumps Car tire with rim Basketballs Paper    Also,what about making a world record for largest smoothie made?
Thumbnail/click bait Vs real video  blender bottom, handle, and golf ball volume inside blender all not accurate to real video. Not necessarily a complaint, it’s very noticeable is all.
The look on Herron face was priceless. Admit it you guys peed a little. Lol
I'll never understand the shortening of literally EVERY word! tenny, telly, sunny. Why does everything end in ly?
Pleeeaaaasssseeee blend a small car🤞🤞🤞
Listen I know they wouldn't publish if anybody got hurt at the end. But even in the future and thousands of miles away, I was afraid for my life.
Now THIS was an awesome viddy
Put the Cow in there
This may be my favorite episode by you. Pure genius.😂
awesome looking weather, what the heck, it's 100 degrees here in Bakersfield CA
All I could think was "can you imagine the Margaritas you could make with that?"
FUN!!!!!!!
You've got the nastiest spiders in Australia!
These guys inventing new traps for the “SAW” films
So sorry, the blender is probably on the bottom tier.
This was so surprising. Great video bois
Can you build a massive dishwasher and clean my house and car next
12:58 😂 “oh no.  Oh no.”
What is that abomination !? Who got crazy enough to think about making THAT ?
Lol, runaway circuit. Gotta love it
There was too much around the blades when it started.  It overloaded seemingly.
Please assure your viewers that you remove the coolant before blending fridges.
Try a human
Love the videos keep up the good work
11:11
Cue the will it blend theme song
This blender is truly ridiculous in the best way possible
i saw the thumbnail, and crapped my pants lmao, brilliant. love you guys, God bless, wish i had some christian freinds like you guys to keep me up beat like your brotherhood.
wow
This brings out the inner child in me!
I'm sure this question wont be seen with the amount of viewers on this. But I am trying to figure out what kind of motor this is. It cannot have a gearbox because most gearboxes increase torque but decrease rpm. With you all setting it to 1750rpm, thats got to be across the line. But with it being in the Aussie land at 50hz it seems like it should be only up to 1500 rpm. So i guess they are using a 60 hz generator. But the fuc*ing muscle the motor must have to chomp through the ingredients in the blender has to come out at what... 20hp (15kw) or what? more? Can anyone guess on this? Maybe its DC but still a direct shaft to chomp is nuts.
You guys need to make the world’s largest smoothie
New fear unlocked when it shows the view from above down on the spinning blades 😳
Dropping in there would definitely be a way to die
The promise land.
Interesting idea… ever thought of doing stuff with JELLO? Like Clayton, mega dart, or Rexy through Jello to see what happens. I think that would be pretty Ridiculous
I gotta say I thought this would be a fun watch but this ended up just being so wild lol.  That giant blender did much better than I expected.
A ten iron is basically a pitching wedge
Add animal bones and that's how gelatin is made
Question: where do you guys even store the giant hammer?
The phrase of the day is absolutely "well that's not in one piece anymore."
This will probably get you guys canceled. But it's probably the most satisfying. And most curious video that everybody would probably want to see. Ballistic dummies You probably should use the zombies.
Don't Breathe that
*That went crazy at the end!!*
I think the refrigerator and TV were the most entertaining.🤣
As a person who’s worked in Alabama for 25 years “the e-stop is not working” is something you’re told on your first day at work.
it sounded like the blade was gonna fly away...bahahaha. 💡helicopter....like the toy 😳 giant
Better not put the golf balls in blender again.
I love the importance of Safety this channel practices
If it catches fire, just throw some fire extinguisher in it.
Just when I thought of everything possible your team could do you blow my socks off with this massive blender- Congrats! Now lets see how many other tubers take your idea and run with it LOL
this is my deathblend 🧟
If it were possible I'd have to say these guys have too much fun!
overloaddd
I want to see more of this... maybe Mark Rober could help perfect the engineering? 🤔
Happy wheels irl
the ball blender
I used to have a recurring nightmare of falling into a giant blender probably because of that simpsons treehouse of horror episode where they cook all the school kids.  Thanks for bringing my worst fear to life.
What the dial needed was a 4 then a 44 then an over 9000.
An orginal idea? i don't just mean you guys either, your insanity is more than enough lol. YT is mostly copycats
it finally looks like a food blender
Go GORE!
The E-stop clearly failed because ya’ll set it to Turbo-Psiycho. Everyone knows Turbo-Psiycho has no E-stop.
I think it would have been cool if it exploded but at the same time it was probably really expensive and dangerous.
turn it up to 9 😏
the clubheads in the 44 club
1:21 In and you’ve done it again boys! Well flipping done 👏 Bring on the mayhem!
five hundreeeeeeeeeeed whack
That was interesting
i was genuinely worried there at the end lol
chippy the chopper blade
Definitely should make sure to have the estop be mechanical as well as access to the power cord within the bunker for ability to unplug it from saftey.
fouuuuuuuur....i mean threeeee walls
Top Gear made a blender that was powered by a Corvette engine.  You guys should do that.
I want to see orbeez in that thing!
This takes “Will it Blend?” To a whole new level
Next up giant waffle maker!
Put ballistic man in there
I have literally ordered the rest of my family to watch this video because how often do you get to say you watched a refrigerator get put into a blender?
We could use that contraption in the UK for all the pedos !
I had the Emergency stop not working for me the other day, generator running rampant. Chief mechanic for the company had me (i'm a boat captain) unscrew the fuel filter to kill the thing. Turns out the head gasket was blown, and the generator was spinning so fast that electric input was irrelevant, even with a blown gasket the pistons were making the heat and pressure to keep the diesel firing. Frightening as fuck, being in the engine room of a boat, thinking this thing might blow up at any time and knowing that i'm the fucking captain, and just hoping that if disaster strikes,  that the first mate or whatever can at least ram us ashore where my mangled carcass can be safely loaded into an ambulance. Didn't turn out that scary, but still, you don't know what to expect with a runaway engine.
You have made the perfect slow mo machine. Im speechless
Sharpen me please
tv chip shake
WHAT IN THE SAW3 IS THIS 🤡
I'm nearly in love with the work you guys do.
Find one of those car grinders and......
I mean this has to end with an actual nuclear blast, like rock paper scissors to decides who drops the nuke right?
This is from the splatoon octo expansion
Drop a frozen pig in there or a cow or somethin I was looking forward to seeing that manikin be dropped but also kinda figured the motor would act up just that kinda thing, 1 giant trampoline 2 giant hammer/axe 3 the motor with flyswatters swords baseball bats now a giant blender, I’d love to see something like that be built but with like standing chainsaws but what’s next on the giant scale can’t wait to see it
that was wild. there was genuine fear in your eyes for a minute there. it really was psiyco
No slowies?
westinghouse blade killer
You should’ve put Rexy in there
airbag n bowlingball splat were amazing
"Blender dust...don't breath that"
blendtech did a broom handle, you should do a telephone pole
Your sharpness is in question....
😂 hey guys is Joshua's making a video These are the kind of videos you like to see something different this is pretty cool thank you again for the world's largest blender
E-STOP should never ever fail. WTF? Who designed that thing?
I feel like there was a missed opportunity to make a giant fruit smoothie with a big ice block. Maybe in another video.
gives me happy wheel vibes
How do you guys keep coming up with the most random stuff that i absolutely cant resist watching
whole e fuck. words cannot describe how much i enjoyed that.
at the ending i was like hot dam glad yall be alreight
How ridiculous is how they dancing in a giant blender with no emergency shut down
You guys should blend the 10 mil sub diamond playbutton
With the giant blender now at their disposal, the guys could make a terrific group of villains to a British spy or agent platypus.
Curious question are the cheezy cartoon thumbnails by every YouTuber and algorithm thing? They are all terrible looking
Tennis shreds
Fruit smoothie, nice
the blender pulled a chernobyl
Double meanings
I can’t be the only one thinking this… collab with ballistic high speed and blender a full body ballistic dummy lab. Or a torso.
I'm curious what the overload settings are on that VSD...
does a surfboard count as bay leaves....😏
This almost felt like something man has created that had no business creating cause it was tampering with powers that mankind was not yet ready to wield. Even the computer unable to stop the blades was like "You have delved in to territories beyond my control and have thusly doomed thyself".
Fill it up with heavy cream and make butter
Wow, first one totally mental.
Probably the coolest thing y’all have made.
They should’ve blended blenders with something blended in the blenders they blended
This is the best thing you’ve ever built 🤙🏽
Blender vs... Safe, Glass ball, All the hard metals and stones.
6:42 That tootsie roll pop went on the third lick! 😂😂😂😂
Will it blend? That is the question.
This is quality! Good work boys in coming up with an original use of that sweet motor.
This is bananas. I adore it.
Golf balls so yellow it looked like a popcorn maker
Am I the only disappointed one that they didn't make a smoothie in this?🤣
there is no way there is 500 tennis balls in that container. 75-100 at most.
YOOOOOOOO!!!
Y’all need a black friend I’m available….
How the fuck do y’all only put 4 pieces of fruit in there wtf
Lmao @ Gaunson's O face on repeat
This a helicopter motor, isn't it?
You mean to tell me you didn't fill this blender full of rex's?
Imagine dropping as human in that thing 😳 😅
I love these guys😂😂😂. PYICHIOO
Name the blender Hank for no specific reason.
A ton of orbeez in this would be sick
The number 1 question is why did you not make the world’s largest smoothie
I needed that laugh 🤣 why us men don't live to long
The psychotic side of me briefly imagined dropping a body in there….
You almost created a tear in space and time with that last one 😂
This worked so much better than I expected!  Awesome video guys
You need to do a REAL TEST, with it, like make the worlds largest Smoothy.... or... beef paste?  You know, make it do blender things instead of food processor things.
44
Total chaos yet probably one of the best episodes in a while
That was EPIC!!!
I do really think you should get the blender up to speed and then drop stuff onto it. Every time something went wrong it was when you tried to start it with the object already touching the blades. It takes a huge amount of power to get the blades up to speed when they already have to push through an object. If you speed them up first it's a lot easier to maintain that since you already have it.
i sure do love it when my giant blender spinning at 1750rpm and isn't stopping while also getting faster :)
The Grand Tour boys are SWEATING right now 😂
Sounds like the E stop was a Turbo button lol😅
just wonder , , guys , , what is left , , you have done all in my imagination , , ???
All I have to say is WOW!!! 😵‍💫
Maybe the belt was slipping but at the same time if that was true then why didn't the button stop it and why was it speeding up. Sounds like a runaway motor instead of a runaway diesel..... running on it's own voltage
9:57 My arachnophobia could never, I was about to cry just seeing the spider
I AM SO HAPPY U GUYS LEFT THAT UNCUT CHAOS AT THE END
Oh yeah, buy an elective vehicle.
That's nuts!  Glad you guys are safe! Can't wait for part2!
My favorite part is when it blended the emergency stop out of existence! 😂😂
Boys, I think this is the best thing you've made so far. You could build your entire channel around just dropping more and more stuff in this thing
Without a doubt the best video with the spinning machine
That’s incredible 😂😂
I think this might be one of the best videos you guys have ever made
Those golf balls looked a lot like popcorn!! Can't wait for part 2!!
One could say that "that golf Club gave you a hole-in-one"
Whwn you start off when thw woed "unboxing", I quit watching and turn you off. Am so tired of this! Just show the product and what it does and be done with it!
I'm cringing as I watch that insane thing spin up. That machine is truley terrifying. I wouldn't want to be anywhere near that thing.
IM SORRY BUT WHAT KIND OF BRAVERY DO YOU NEED TO FLICK A SPIDER THAT BIG???!!! WITHOUT FLINCHING???!!!! SOLUTE TO YOU!!!
Well that got a little bit scary
Your should get the fabricators to do blogs or videos. Your contraptions are so awesome!
That was awesome! 💯
Cow! Run!
When the emergency stop doesnt stop. That's the definition of fear. Glad nothing bad happened because of it. Hopefully they get that worked out for the next video
Awesome!  You  do the crazy stuff so we don't have to!
The Blender was cool and all but that ending was like something out of a movie.
I'm always surprised on the shear carnage the blinder does to the each next object😂😂  Idk if that proper English but it gets the point across🤣
yeehaw
guys, you could have made the biggest margarita ever, but you chosen to destroy stuff. :(
That was insane Dunno what happened at the end there but maybe worth having a hardline to the generator estop in the crate with you
Should do a full pig from the butcher’s shop
Better than mythbusters 🤣
Drop a glider from a helicopter moving forward
To be a fly on the wa… err to be a cow in that pasture would be awesome
Feels like a Gaunson idea
They should put a safe in that thing
World's largest Golf Ball washing machine.  Complete with smoke and anxiety. Bravo!
y'all should have got a feral pig or something to drop in there
Only the golf clubs get a hole in one lol
Imagine being one of those cows on that field lmao. Theyve seen so much
Nothing is topping this
This was next level… and I thoroughly enjoyed it 😂
That was one of the scariest moments I have ever seen on YoTube
Gaunsen taking a sniff of that fiberglass not a good idea lmao
The cord was 2 foot away and instead of saying let me grab it and unplug you balled up into a corner while the real men took care of it unsubscribed you do dangerous stuff but everyone else is in danger while you hide in safety
It just disintegrated
The last one is a pretty decent correlation to what happens in our cells when multiple fail safes go wrong- and uncontrolled mitosis starts to occur. When redundancy mechanisms fail- especiallyconcerning cell replicationor apoptosis, thats one of the hallmarks of cancer.
you can tell that they spend all there money on their videos.
New Shirt: "Error 56"
"People think you can learn the english language, they are wrong, you have to memorise it". Best comment ever 😂
I thought for sure Colinfurze was going to crank out one of these, congrats boys for doing it first!
Ya’ll this is one of your best vids. I do miss the dam though
This video has really hit the laughter levels to the max. Thanks guys #44 club
You could have created a black hole 😵‍💫
Wheeeew…blender smoke. Don’t breath this!
You should've wrote "ridiculous speed"....
Love you fellas but STOP BEING DRAMATIC lmao I dont think your lives were ever in danger because a giant blender full of golf balls wouldnt shut off LOL I mean you guys are in a giant metal shipping container for a reason right?? SO JUST STOP IT haha
Wow. You finally brought the blender we asked for. I love ❤ you guys. Watch from Ghana (Africa)
The start-up alone gave me the heebies. Y'all are some mad lads!
You lot and the slo mo guys need to get to getther with this blender and put fire in there, somehow, doesn't matter just fire, big blender, slo mo.
This is a Killer Video - You have  outdone yourself!!!
I need to climb I to a massive blender for work to clean it out, and we do basically the same thing to make sure I don't turn into a smoothie
What interested me is how similarly fridges and televisions behave in a blender to the fruit and stuff I put in mine. 🤔 I love how educational this channel is!
Best blender ever. You are so creative. Love it.
Should have dropped the golf balls in at the end instead of starting with the blade surrounded by them
I wonder where all the residual garbage that all of these video produce go.
This is terrifying
"Surfboard?" * whirrr * "What surfboard?"
Instead of 4 they need to add 44
I never thought you guys could top the Giant Axe, but this is mental, absolutely loved this video!
You absolute mad lads. I can see a whole lot of content coming for the blender. Different blade attachments, maybe 44 Club contest for the engineers in the audience to suggest new cutter designs?
Look at that spoida!
Honestly, I wanna know what kinda spider it was that he just tested into oblivion 10:04
Sees the thumbnail. Me an intellectual: that’s a lot of popcorn  Heron: jumps in tub of golf balls Me: oh yeah that checks out.🤦🏽‍♂️😂
spectacular.
Would have loved to have seen some Slow mo!!!!
This is the only spinning blade idea that I sort of like. I still can't get over what an... unfortunate incident would look like, been to a few doozies.  - former CSI
No Spiders were hurt in the making of this video. -arachnid media alliance
13:36 - Why didn't either of you write '44', and turn the dial to that??
forgot the cow or pig or hum ops nothing never mind wait humming bird. yeah thats it
The blender is the best invention yet!!! I need to see it destroy a car hahah
As we used to say back in the day: "Will it Blend? That is the question..."
This is the best idea you guys have had can't wait to see the bigger version we're u blend a hole car 🚗
I am become blend, the juicer of worlds.
Blend a giant rubber band ball!! 👍👍👍😎😎
That was Absolute CARNAGE !!!! It was Beautiful !!!! 🤯
Let me just say this is one of the best ideas you guys have ever had! Freaking genius!
who was responsible for the e-stop? That is literally wiring 101. Just break the power.
i literally thought it was going to just explode in a spray of golf balls when it started smoking
Do a cow next time!!
You guys almost make Oppenheimer 2 💀
that was intense
Elephant smoothie when?
The most insane part about all of this is when they go to clean up the parts like the TV for instance they're doing it with no mask or face filtration of any sort. TVs and other electronics are full of rare metals that when made in a tiny particles and put into the air can be deadly. wish they are a little bit more safe about this.
It turned itself up to 11
Will it Blend? The Supersized Edition
My day gets better everytime I see yall have uploaded
When I thought you were running out of ideas 😮😅😂
That's freaking awesome 😂 ... turbo blender is awesome 👍👍
I know I’m not the only one that wants to see what happens to a goat or a pig or something like that.
Cool video.
You might want to get a wee pressure washer to just hose that thingy down after some melon type action.
A two parter?!? You should have warned us… 😤
Maybe not full of food right off that bat ya know just so you dont immediately waste it all, but would def be interested to see it 3/4 full of water with one ballon of food die and watch in slowmo as it gets poped.
I want to see the world's largest smoothie
You have to love when the only two outcomes are success and disaster
I think it would be terrifying being inside that thing attaching the blades!
What’s more frightening is that you guys were standing inside a blender that you didn’t have full control over! 😮
What’s the next giant creation, maybe a giant gold club to launch things into a pit? ⛳️
Did Turbo mode override the Estop?
WILL IT BLEND?
From the start this looks like it won’t survive for a blender pt2. 😂😂
VFD variable frequency drive ESC electronic speed controller Same thing, 3 phase switch
I need to see a safe dropped in there
O Dear......
Bom bam bem😂
Cant wait for part 2
I thought blennders were built for food
love it
Of course the golf bag had lefty clubs. Can't us lefties get a break
that could take a hole school buss of kids
After the surfboard I began to wonder if you were going to name the blender after a shark.
I hope there are many more big blender videos to come! This is an awesome series!
10:23 yes. One of you (maybe Scott) said “useless buttons”
You could make so many chicken nuggets with that thing
Video starts at 14:07
you need ludicrous speed.
Is gawnson ok he looks like he is going through something serious?
44 club. Also this is the best thing yall have done
Tom Dickson of Bledtec would be proud.
Stanford is looking a tad bit homeless and he needs a haircut/shave... 😅
All I have to say is "Will it blend"
Y’all need a second channel to cover the engineering design/build process of making these things and review how they perform.
Bro i have the same feeling as you guys, i tought it was going to explode when it was starting to smoke a bit😅 luckily it didn't explode it still works, and that thing when you guys putted it in turbo it actually did turbo😂  edit: please like this comment
Soooo gooood
That was awesome :)
E-stop is supposed to just stop power from going to said machine I think so I have no clue how it didn’t work
9:57 Are Wolf spiders very common in Australia? I know we have them absolutely all over here in the American Midwest.
This viddie had a double dollop of chaos
Pikiran saya cuma satu mengapa anda tidak membuat juss terbanyak mengunakan blender itu, serta membangikannya ke jalanan
This is entertaining!
This thing is insane!
I know I already commented but my inner pyro says put a propane tank in it! No, not a good idea but.....💥🔥
As an engineer, I am really fascinated by the forces at play in this one... really good construction. I assume you went with the 2 thinner pieces of poly, as opposed to 1 thicker piece to allow for more flex, and prevent sudden (shattering) failure?
RIP YouTube bitrate 😂
I thought I was about to hear the GTA San Andreas theme as the blender started up
Okay  That was cool!
You guys call vfd’s vsd’s in Aussie land?
Will it Blend?™
After the very first blend of the blenders, I'm thinking there's no way that plexiglass is going to make it through the testing. And how do you get all the crap debris out the bottom easily?
This is by far the best gadget you guys have made yet.
Good thing you guys weren’t relying on the E-stop before going inside that thing
I’m glad everyone’s okay!!
You should do a ballistic gel dummy zombie that would be awesome
Rip environment
it just wouldn’t be “How Ridiculous” if they didn’t break things… just should’t break their toy breakers..
i half expected it to start flying in the beginning
HUMANS ?😳
That surf board...HA!
Will It blend?
This video is triggering Splatoon fans' PTSD
nice video :D
Blendteck: will it blend rebirth
I say next time you have a run away just let her go 🤪
There was a massive opportunity lost to say " Oh, _____ smoke, don't breath this!"
10:02 Me: Only in Old Australia
But will it blend?
"We have multiple fail-safes."   Shows a singe fail-safe.
Editor Jack is the eye candy in the group :)
Is that a labview gui i see there!!?
Just ordered 3 pack of those golf balls that were blended so dope ❤❤
Bro my heart stopped beating for a sec when it didn’t turn off even with the e stop
This was terrifying even before the runaway blender. I hope part 2 involves a massive overhaul of the thing that can kill you without ever noticing you were even there...
That is legitimately terrifying.
How good?!!! Holy buckets gentlemen! Awesome video!
Was the emergency stop a prop?
This was a lot of fun, one of the best you´ve made! Kudos for the mega blender!
In my mind when you saw that spider (very cute BTW) I though you were gunna blend it.😂
these are the only guys on the planet who would think to chuck stuff into a giant blender they built i swear...
This is definitely the best idea yet
Pink Floyd The Wall vibes
if that broke so many poor cows. but a price to pay for such an epic video
get a tungsten tiped giant dart and drop it on bruce
Could you also do a satisfying jet washer competition😂
Damn glad u guys r alright
You should blend a ton of fake money.
HOW MUCH FRUIT WOULD IT TAKE TO MAKE A SMOOTHY IN THIS SIZE BLENDER?!?!?! Or could you even make a smoothy that large? I feel like there could be a world record attempt somewhere in there...😁 LOL SO FUN!
they should make a giant fruit smoothie
At the beginning the machine is scary, at the end it is terrifying.
WHAT IN THE HELL DID YOU BUILD?! 😧😧😧😧 That thing is  gonna open a black hole. Or solve world peace and world hunger simultaneously.
Swear I heard some moshpit guitar with that fridge
put a ballistic dummy lab gel dummy in the blender
Genuinely worried someone is going to be serious maimed on this crew.
I’ve been following your channel for a long time (44 Club 🎉) but this is probably one of the most RIDICULOUS things you guys have done 👏👏👏 too good gents.
The previous things that contraption have made have been interesting and a bit scetch... that blender is starting to feel a bit cursed.
No slowies?
The little "oop" when el-spidro got flicked 🤣
Wow
So when do you blend the jet-ski, the airplane and the boat?
omg  AT NIIGHT GLOW STUFF PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Need to put about 200 Rex's in there. LOL... Dyno-meat sausage. LOL...
Why didn't Adolf just do this?
Wow I thought there was going to be a boom or one of the sides braking open and golf balls go flinging all over the place lol
This is so cool, if it does kick the bucket I hope it gets a 2.0 version.
From dropping stuff off of a tail staircase, to building the wildest machines on youtube. 44club from the beginning
The ending was terrifying and yet it was something I expected to happen
Should do it with wayyyyy more melons and other fruit
Biggest golf smoothie with to much power
Through a quick Google search, the average TV lasts between 4.5 and 6.8 years, meaning that TV was between 12.5 and 20.4 years old
I still love the hammer but the blender may be the coolest thing y'all done.
The entire video I had "Blendtec's will it blend" Stuck in my head.... If you know, you know.....
Best one ever
I loved it. I hope REXY survived. Mine is here . Above me on the ceiling fan. Thank you all and he likes you down under. Even the Friends like him too. Outback Steakhouse . Beaufort South Carolina. USA. He will be the Co-Pilot in the Right Seat Need a booster Chair and a set of head phones . wish that I could send you the Photo's of Him . He has gotten use to a shot of Captain Morgan Rum. Arrgh. We care. Cm.
This has to be one of the best videos yet!!!! I was laughing the whole time! That Rocked!!!
In 100 years these are gonna be in torture museums like the Iron Maiden 😂 gonna be used as examples of how “brutal and barbaric we were”
Reminds me of the cat thing horophying
The surfboard surfing the blades has to be one of the coolest things I’ve seen in my life
This channel is unbearably entertaining 🤦🏽‍♂️😩 much love to you fellas from allll the way over here in Kentucky!
waste?
I keep thinking that they can't make anything cooler than what they already have. Glad to be proven wrong every time!
"If there's one thing you don't put in your blender, it's a bowling ball"
Amazing
it's more like a grinder than a blender. blades are blunt as all "heck" but good effort.
Insane fellas!! 😂🤩
THIS is the BEST video you've made!!! SO much fun to watch and genuinely was smiling the WHOLE TIME!! LOVE it lads! Keep it up MORE BLENDER BLENDER BLENDER!
I really thought it was about to explode 🤣I was really hoping
Lads, you all are brilliant. You keep finding ways to up the ante. Bravo!
video idea!!!!!  build a giant toaster that can launch things as high as possible
The yelling cow is my kind of energy.
Make the world's largest smoothie with the blenda!🍇🍈🍉🍊🍋🍌🍍🍎🍏🍑🍐🫐🍓🍒🥝🥭
Blend-tec is nothing compared to this 😂
when these boys going to clear all there rubbish from the drop tower
In a YouTube world you guys are keeping it new and fresh with new ideas! Cheers
This makes me ask, "How Ridiculous"
You could a fit whole person in there...
Almost had the world's largest blender related workplace liability insurance claim
Emergency Stop button cannot be a trigger for a software stop command, it needs to just physically kill power like flipping circuit a breaker. It could (probably should), additionally, trigger a stopping mechanism to stop the blades from spinning once the power is cut off.
I think you should try ooblek see what happenes with that🤔
I love how the boys were giggling like school girls at the destruction happening...& we're all here for it!
Gives a whole new aspect to the "Will it Blend" videos lol
I’m not past blending the blenders, and this is already my favorite video ever 😂
The most amazing thing you’ve ever made. Period.
Looks like popcorn kernels
I think this is by far my favourite video thus far! Awesome idea!
The golf ball’s remind me of lotto number balls
so much terror, no 44 club farewell
Love it
Why did the EMERGENCY STOP BUTTON FAIL?!
the sound it makes starting up is excruciating and made the video difficult to watch.😢
Should have went ping pong
Play the video in reverse and try to guess what has being shredded.
Putting the old will it blend blendtech videos to shame what's next a massive microwave lol keep up the great work guys!
This is Definitely the most amazing thing you guys have built. I know for sure that poly cost a ton of cash. Lexan is not cheap. Maybe some thick Bullet proof Poly next go.
These dudes are proof that weed doesn't make you dumb
I was waiting for a new video from you guys and decided to binge watch old ones. I saw a comment about a giant blender on one vid and thought, hey. That's cool. I hope they do it. You guys are so much fun to watch. No offence to all of the other channels I watch, but you guys are my favorite channel.
Even the tv was juicy
Should have blended a giant ice block
The bowling ball was incredible and the golf clubs. Great work guys. God bless
That wasn't the same as 🤬.  But it was pretty worth it.
The smoke from the blender was probably the belts slipping and the smoke from the generator was just exhaust from it working harder.
Y’all can put every fruit you can machine lol
44 club 4 ever!!!!
You should add a flywheel to the blender, that will help to prevent it overloading when it hits something "chunky"
Runaway motor? It a diesel generator? "Many failsafes" lol
That thing is frightening!
Is there a new Saw movie coming out?
Great video! i do recommend a mechanical lock on the blades even if your disconnected from power.
sick
Ai said MORE POWER
"Well that's not in one piece anymore"  will always give me a big belly laugh.
Bro brought happy wheels blender levels to real life
No cows were harmed in the making of this epic masterpiece
Awesome. However, I suggest hardened steel blades with a proper edge on them.
🙉🙊🙈
Now we wait for one of HR's contraptions to spontaneously combust.
Brilliant!!! 🤣
I think that airbag video was my first How Ridiculous Video. It’s nice to see it referenced
Y'all extreme
BLEND THE COW! BLEND THE COW! BLEND THE COW!
Remember earlier in the video when “multiple failsafes” was mentioned? They should have added text that said “Epic Foreshadowing”. 😂
please do another one of these vidys that was amazing!
if that was just normal glass for the blender walls i'm surprised it held up so long
These guys saw an avenue that "Will It Blend?" wouldn't go down.
Now a will it blend series!
Thanks for the video.
That golf ball smoothie looked mad delicious
Would love to see a banjo or many in that blender! :)
So this is where Commander Tartar from Splatoon 2: Octo Expansion got his inspiration from
Me: Wow. You Bois made about 70% of a canonical Saw trap. Also Me: *_WoW_* You Bois almost took part in a completely different Saw trap by the end                             If anyone is curious. The Blender is similar to a trap in Jigsaw where a guy has to essentially dangle into a running 'blender'-esque trap. And the 2nd is that the Blender almost exploded shrapnel, like in the nail bomb 'traps' in Saw V.
This might just be the most terrifying contraption you've had on your channel, though the katana blade helicopter would be a close second.
This one's my favorite ever 🎉
Should have blended a blendtec blender. Give it a taste of its own medicine.
Well done!👏 I haven't watched in while. This has to be one your best!
That's how bingo balls should be extracted lol
Will it blend? Don't breath that in.
We likey the blender!
LETS GO GOLFING🗣️⛳
you should have put the cow in there
Ey I can cook. I'll be the chef
I love this channel so much!
This worked surprisingly well😂
Should try one of those realistic dummies that Forged in fire uses
Will It Blend: Giant Edition
Imma be honest boys, while I still absolutely love the content, I miss seeing the full introductions whenever the big new toys made their debut. What I mean is, for example, when all of the props from the tower like Suzie, Clayton, Maxwell, and Spike Tyson first appeared on the scene, their respective videos all showed the machine shops where they were made. We got to see time lapses of them being made, and we got to briefly meet the people who made them. But now over the last couple of years with the crazy new props we've seen (giant hammer, giant helicopter-bat, giant axe, giant fly swatter, giant blender etc) the videos all start the same. There's no intro at all. The boys are in an open field, they show us the item, and within barely 15 seconds or so, they're already onto the destruction. I wanna learn about the new toys before immediately jumping into the video! Where did the ideas come from? Who are the engineers/machinists that helped build them? What was the process of putting them together like? We saw all these things when Mark Rober helped you build the giant trampoline. We got to learn where it came from so we knew the history of it before seeing it in action. I miss that.
NO OFFICER, this is not for disposing bodies, I swear
Absolutely over the top amazing and terrifying! You guys are in Mythbusters territory with this thing. I'm excited to see what crazy things you come up with next. There's no question that a lot of engineering knowledge is going into something like this, but you seem to have forgotten to install the "Oh shit" lever. Even if that's just a rope you can use to yank the power cord out of the thing. So when you hit the E-stop button and it doesn't work, you literally shout the name of the next thing you should go for.
"Well thats not in once piece anymore."  one of the greatest comments of all time on the channel
Makes me think we could powder our garbage. Landfills wouldn't be mountains anymore.
💕 your uploads fellas, keep up the great work! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What giant item will they think of next?
14:21 the cursed bingo # picker
Ok well now you have to put in a realistic full size ballistic gel dummy with bones and everything
It’s alright Scott I suck at spelling to 😉
Do level 1 to level 100 trick shots
is gauson a harry styles fan???
Tell me hes high without telling me hes High lmfao
Will it blend?
A new take on GMM's 'Will it Blend' series
Fill it up with styrofoam 😂
Best idea in a while
What happened to the age old question….the bell???
This felt like a proper HR video. You got a bit of the old magic back with this one, for sure lads 👍
Fill it with water and make a giant whirlpool
"Yes, it blends!"
they aren't very good cooks
We need to see the world biggest smoothie
Why no blocks of ice?
Bruuu you'll almost made us viewers worry for fucks sakes sheeeshhh
Any chance of dropping a ballistics dummy in there?
This is by far best prop/weapon of mass destruction you guys have made yet. It may need upscaled in the future.. and we need to see a ballistic gel zombie torso and head thrown in!
Awesome job with this one guys...but you might want to look up the 'AZ5' factor from Chernobyl...lol
I would definitely be in Herron’s position with how much of a come to Jesus moment that could’ve been.
That's another one for Australia's biggest things, right on boys
Put pieces of the tennis balls in the store 😂
I keep wondering what you guys are gonna do next. don't ever change lads
They certainly blended YouTube’s nitrate with this upload 😂
Plz get your fridge de-gassed in the future, so you don't go and release all the harmful CFCs into the atmosphere!
This is the most BRUTAL thing you've ever made! I didn't expected it to be that way hahahahha
It’s amazing what you guys have done through the years
fuck me man that ending was scary as fuck
The bowling ball reminded me of that old game called bubble trouble we'd all play in class
Blendtec has entered the chat
Ooh spider *flick* only in Australia mate
Need to make a giant smoothie or milkshake.  Love the videos.
i need the slowy.
This would have been the PERFECT video to use a full size balistics gel dummy with all the fake bones and blood 😂💀😂
What about a giant tornado machine 🤔
I almost pretty sure that this blender is a world guiness record in size and power! Awesome! I would love to see in detail the guts of this blender!
Y'all need to bring Tom Dickson the Blendtec guy in on this next time!
I’m proud to be a 44 member for over 4 years! How Good!!!
Careful with the spiders
I say you just lost serial communication with the VFD so it defaulted to 100%. As for the smoke, best guess is that was from the 3 V-belts slipping.
i voted on this
Ooo I do love a bit of drama
I am amazed the cows nearby didn't give a fart about the blender.  They kept on eating the grass as if nothing is going on.  🤣🤣
That worked amazing
WTF WHERE IS REX??????
Karens: “This is so bad for the environment I can’t believe they would do thi…” Giga Chad: “Shut up they’re about to blend some blenders”
You definitely need to make a massive milkshake...after cleaning it up ofc
Did you really just almost lose control of that thing?
Why no slowmo camera on all of them? 🎥
Now make the world’s largest fruit smoothie!
0:24 this was the best part of the video
I have seen some terrifying things on the internet... the cartels could use this blender for some crazy videos.
This crazy thing and is new🤔😱😱😎 hope everything is ok and yes make sure everything is safe!!
Everyone scared for their lives I would have started running 😂
The things you guys come up with is just insane..Brilliant ❤
“Look at ‘im! On the black sheet ye- oh” 10:00
14:29 reminds me of the movie Twister. Aww memories.
But I’m GRATEfull still, because it’s Gouda be a good video
Not every day you see a refrigerator get blended lol😂 such a great vid
A video with a cliffhanger!?!?!? ... 😮
as a leftie.. i woulda bought that 10 iron off ya!
You guys never cease to amaze did not expect this some good slowies to come.......
In the second part you should drop some politicians in.
ping pong balls!
this gotta be the best video yet
Do orbeeeeeeezzzzzz
Guys, this has to be the most insane machine you've built yet. You truly have outdone yourselves! This is why I love your channel. You do things I can only dream of doing.Lastly. This is the first time I have actually seen REAL fear. The overload was criminally insane!
I hate to be cheesy, but you should put cheese in there
Do it at night with things that glow.
If you were to drop in about a dozen frozen chickens or even wallabies, that would lube up the blades!  🐔
Who else here is waiting for the blender b2b Oppenheimer Collab?
For a second there I thought it was going to blow up😧
OMG!! This is absolutely brilliant!!! This is hilarious!!! I can't fathom why this won't go viral!  Seriously one of the best ideas yet!!
This might be my fav video EVER!!!!! It's definitely my fav things you guys have built!!❤❤❤❤
Flash backs to Splatoon 2: Octoexpansion
Propane can in the blender for part two hopefully. Might cause accidental grand finale, this things wild.
Since I’m pretty sure it’s the same spinning machine with different attachments, I think it needs a name. I nominate Rosie like ring around the Rosie.
You need to reach out to BlendTec for a new edition of Will it Blend?
Who turned it up to Plaid?
Holy shit but you boys bring out the lunatic child in me. Thanks heaps, I needed this!
Fast and loose
Well that was an exciting end! I feel you need to send E-stop a harshly worded email.
a+
I was totally prepared to hate this video. "A BLENDER?" I scoffed. "How boring!" How WRONG I was!!!!!!! One of the BEST videos you guys have ever done-though a bit of danger always keeps things interesting too!!!! Review your safety procedures, learn from it, and you'll move forward even better prepared for even greater things. Great work guys!
The cows are like what is going on 🤣
aitch.
Can you put a dead pig from the butcher and chunks of meat in next.Equals gore for gore fans
At least the generator E-stop still worked. As someone else already said, I recon something is shorted in the ESC and resulted in the E-stop attempt to disconnect temporarily welding some contacts closed and dumping everything the generator could give into the motor, which is why it sped up.  There may be no permanent damage but that thing is probably stuck on "ULTRA-PSYChO" now
i liked the blender part
I legit am on my way to go buy a vitamix blender and then scroll and see this.. Life's timing is a trip bruh 💀
"How is it surfing??!!"  Ummm, it's a ...never mind mate!🤣
Sooooo, we gonna talk about that this came out after they dropped the Saw X trailer....? No? Only me? Ok
Bro. I saw the thumbnail and thought, worlds largest popcorn maker?
As a machinist "The E-Stop is not working" might be the most terrifying thing I've ever heard.
You guys are getting gimmicky as hell.
these guys are like if a James Bond villian decided to entertain people instead of destroy the world.
I would be terrified standing in the blender even knowing there are multiple safety
you should opt for a table mounted circuit breaker that has the main machine power running through it. mechanical switches are good for e-stops coz it physically cuts the power to the machine, instantly. it could save your electric motor and power supply circuits. what would be the absolute protection for your gear would be to have a monitoring and control software that automatically cuts the power in the event of zero rpm and still having wattage being fed to the motor, which would cause motor overload.
Remember "will it blend"? This is "it will blend."
The ending looked scary
That was crazy. All cut down to size.
That spider was just minding its spider business 😭😭😭
This was a great video, but as a headphone user, I'm deaf now. PS: the end was scary af.
I’ll take a rather ridiculously large margarita!
I feel like this should be a form of capital punishment for traitors to America at guantanimo bay...
You missed a golden opportunity to turn it up to 44
i would love to see videos of the guys who build your stuff.  they are the real stars.
This feels more like a 22 club post
Is this our first "to be continued" on the channel? Excellent vid, boys! Glad everybody's safe!
FOR SHAME!   A blender that size, and no margaritas? Come on guys.  🎵 I blew out my flip-flop Stepped on a pop-top Broke my leg twice I had to limp on back home But there's booze in the blender And soon it will render That frozen concoction that helps me hang on Hang on Hang on  Wasted away again in Margaritaville Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt Some people claim that there's a woman to blame But I know, it's my own damn fault Yes, and some people claim that there's a woman to blame And I know it's my own damn fault 🎵
ERROR 56 OCCURED. what's ERROR 56.
Anyone else watching this while taking a shit
We wanted to see a whole cow
Something we didn't know we all needed
Cant imagine what it must have felt like being in that bunker with everything going Psicho
I can't believe you blended a FRIDGE!!!
Put the phantom inside, at the top, aiming down.  That's not sketchy at all
This video has to get insane views. Best HR video ever
I know YouTubes not gonna like it buuuuuuuut...ballistic torso. Camaaaaan
DO GUMBALLS!
Just like with the Chernobyl disaster. Had gone past the point where the fail-safe switch did not work, and disaster occurred. Thankfully we have better fail-safe buttons.
Who thought the blender was going to blow episode 1?
On todays episode of "Will it Blend". Boys you have really outdone yourselves on this one. Giant blender takes the gold!
Great.. now I have a new fear... 😮
Tom Dixon would be very proud
You should never have shown us the trick of writing our own speeds on the blender! I wrote FTL on mine and it went so fast it broke reality and pulled me into a different universe! This channel is named "How Deranged" in my universe. And why do you all have Antartician accents now? You're from New Holland.
Will it blend? That is the question
the way the spider was there and then it just wasn't tho 😂
I miss a cat in this video...
Is scott okay?
that blender is wicked
Yeah.  Before you power that back up you probably want to figure out why the emergency stop doesn’t, you know, stop. 😂😂
Throw in a crocodile.
a spider that big would probably freak me out a bit... my man just flicked it off like nothing... you Australians are just built different lol
OMFG! WHAT HAVE YOU GUYS DONE! 😳😳😳😳😳😳
8:32 looks like the interstellar docking scene. just play no time for caution behind it.
I hope guanson is practicing for your next vid that should involve golf!!!! Lol 😅
I LOVE the blender idea. Brilliant. Loving Brent's long hair too.
Ballistic dummy. Just saying out loud what everyone thinks, ok.
That thing is terrifying, it is ridiculous!
Bro, this is gonna be the worlds first lag
Not gonna lie, while this was an epic video, I was genuinely scared for y'all when that blender went out of control.
Long time 44 club member here and I've been saying for a while that you guys tend to walk the line between safe and stupid.   When Scott says "I didn't even know there was an E-Stop on the generator" it's obvious you guys aren't doing your safety side correctly.  Those moments that Derek talked about being scared for his life (jokingly) are what you have to avoid. Every person on the job should know exactly how to kill the blender if they have to.   Love you guys a lot but PLEASE be better on your safety. I would hate to see one of you guys or the crew, hurt.
The E-stop is actually psyco mode.
Will it blend? That is the question/
y
The creativity is great, but by George is Scott troubled in the English language.
Genius.
Next thing they built is the worlds largest Microwave or Toaster fr
Hmm could this be used for landfill?
So....the emergency stop doesn't work and they step inside that thing.
blender vs balistics dummy
This has to be one of the freshest, best ideas for a video you've had in a very long time, boys.  10/10. WORLD CLASS RIDICULOUS!
Once again; how ridiculous justifies their channel title!
Your scientists were too worried wondering if they could do it, they never stopped to think if they should.
*A WESTINGHOUSE JOKE* 😂  *Bugs Bunny* wakes up in the middle of the night and decides to get a snack. He opens his refrigerator and sees *Elmer Fudd* inside...  *BUGS:* Uhm...What's Up Doc? *ELMER:* _Oh, Hewwo Mr. Bunnywabbit!_ *BUGS:* Whatcha doin' in my ice box...bub? *ELMER:* _This is a Westinghouse, isn't it??_ *BUGS:* Yup! *ELMER:* _Well, I was just westing!_
OK, the Blender is pretty cool!
"Will It Blend?" on steroids! Nice!
The tennies were like popcorn
now you need to make the worlds largest smoothie!
You all be crazy
That ending with the golf balls was terrifying. Felt like you were about to open a black hole or something. Good stuff, can't wait to see more of this machine of absolute chaos and destruction. What other havoc will it wreak on the world?
I knew something was going to go wrong at the beginning of the video but I didn’t think it would make me skip a heartbeat!😅
You three might be the most pollutant agents per pound in the world. How sad!
I wonder if the engine ingested some fuel from the air, perhaps from the golf balls causing it to almost run away.
big igd
If there is one thing you don’t put in your blender it’s a bowling ball😂😂😂
You guys should blend a bunch of bang-snaps or pop-it’s (not sure what they are called in Australia) also great vid!
3:43 there are two methods of cutting power to a machine.  There are Lockout/Tagout procedures, and then there's just straight up pulling the plug LOL
Imagine a person fell in there.
14:44 is the start of one of the best scenes from this channel 😂😂😂 all your reactions were hilarious 😂
Im afraid that some French revolutionaries will be getting some bad ideas after seeing this😂
Next we need a giant medieval catapult
A giant blender?! What are you, Batman villains?!
Shake it like a dinosaur, boys!  Like. A. Dinosaur.
Don't breathe this lol
A new level of hectic at the end there.
Don't make these guys mad 💀
Simply amazing guys
YOU USED MY IDEA!!! BLENDERS LOL
vfd
I need to see a margarita..... and leave the top off to see how far the bits go
This thing is every splatter movie bad guys dream.
Chat is this legal?
HOLY SMOKES BOYS!
Just like the good ol Blendtec vids, funnily enough i was watching those only the other day
You guys never cease to amaze! Here’s looking forward to many years to come…
Interesting how the golf balls kind of simulated a fluid.
This is what happens when you blend Australians with Florida Man mentality, and a giant blender.
Really enjoyed this one boys 👌🏻
I hope nobody inhaled that flat-screen. 8^p
On a future video:  world's largest milkshake?
When the E-stop fails... then worry skyrockets.
I’m suggesting a new mode on the blender.   Well that’s not in one piece any more.
I low key thought that the fu**in blender was gonna *💣💥💥*  😳😳😬
i swear if i dont get a "well that aint in one piece anymore" i will be mildly sad
not only did they waste the board, they dident even take off the fins or leash
This is what happens when you’re E stop is just a button that your software references. A true E stop should cut power physically to the motor controller and the system power whenever possible. If your circuitry shorts to a closed position that controls the motors your software won’t be able to stop it. If your software gets stuck then your inputs won’t matter. A true E stop circumvents this by cutting the power to the circuitry. Can’t run a motor if the controller has no power. Better yet, can’t run a motor if the whole system has no power.
The surfboard was surfing on the blades
Why do I want to see balistics gel dummies in there to watch the carnage…
@Blendtec need to reply to this. (I know they have been inactive to 2 years but we can hope)
Bro that would turn you into mush. I wonder what else it could blend 🤭
When the boys are quiet for more than 2 seconds you know something serious is going on
You know what happens when you MAX REV an engine while physically preventing movement with objects like golf balls? Things break.  :)
like any motor more resistance will need more power.  I don't know if yall are using 3 phase power, but i'm pretty sure that would be necessary. if yall are using 3 phase power, and it's still too much. well then these are just the problems of a giant blender.  and you might need more than one motor to spin the blade, as much as that would suck
overprivileged psychos
on this episode of "will it blend?"
That-Is-NUTS!
do Cold Ones please
Part 2? What is this? TikTok? (i know that people can't know this is sarcasm, so i put this here)
Please collab with the Slow Mo Guys
With all of the crap happening in the world now it is so nice just to watch you guys have so much fun doing crazy stuff. Takes my mind off of the troubles. Thank you!
Ok that was awesome. :)
I hope you at least clean up properly with all the animals walking about, eating from the grass
You did turn it way beyond psiycho, IDK what you expected.
how could you do that to a surf board
That ending reminds me of Chernobyl 😂😂
When you did the fridge, it couldn't get up to speed and tripped the thermal overload. It was not cool yet when the tv went in and tripped again.
The views of this video just jumped 35k in the time it took me to watch it.
Wow- “ Will it Blend?” On steroids…..
I love this channel always makes my day and I even go back and watch the old videos it’s just fun and the guys are great
Micro-plastics be damned!
I feel like this channel is the definition of boys will be boys
we need a Gaunson celebrity mugshot style tee shirt. Stat.
Jesus loves you
World's Largest Smoothie is gonna be the next video, right? Like, two garbage cans of ice and a whole buncha fruit.
if Gaunson actually wrote PSALMS and a bible verse I would have shit myself.
I thought like 3y ago you guys have nowhere bigger to go and look at you now. Absolute madmen ♥
Will it blend? That is the question!
It's a good video but such a waste of perfectly usable equipment
Please do rbb vs blender
Ok.  This was a great idea.
Ohh should have started it with a ton of fruit maby.. one huge smoothie
New world record world's largest margarita.
next time drop a small couch into it
Alright, now this is effin' mental.
This one was by far your best idea!! all you needed was a bunch of frogs (stuffed) to dump in.
A giant blender big enough to grind up a whole cow. Then they show the cow:"He's ready"
I’m glad everyone is safe! Very scary ending. Please be well 💞
BEST VIDEO YET
my intrusive thoughts are thinking imagine someone fell in there...
Omg this may be the best use of that helocopter motor. Now we can see the carnage bouncing around
You know its bad when the e-stop doesn’t turn it off anymore
What the stuff?
Wow loved this. Infinitely better than the giant fly swatters. The carnage is contained
By far the coolest destructive device you guys have done.
So many things could have went wrong blades could come apart shaft could have broken the whole assembly come out the side very cool y'all be careful
This may be the greatest build to date!!!!!  Good on ya boys!
the cliffhanger y’all left us with 😭
Golf clubs for the win!
Good job boys, this is the best cure for pedo's yet!
Ok this was a brilliant idea. Not only does it look great it makes for great slowies. Plus it has the added benifit of making clear up easier.
cmon,  i didnt expect a part2
The stuff you guys come up with is freakn awesome 😆😆👍👍
My favorite blender speeds. 1, 2, 3,  , “psycho” spelled wrong, “turbo” facing the wrong way
I swear Gaunson said he came on that surfboard.. I've rewound it so many times and I can't not hear it.
Ow, come one, drop a whole pig. DO IT, for science.
The main button that was supposed to turn everything off didn’t work….  44 clubs version of Chernobyl
Anyone here old enough to remember BlendTec ads?  "Will blenders blend? Yes! Blender smoke, don't breath this!"
A little scary, but yeah fun video!
1. Herring on the thumbnail is LOLZ. 2. What's next, giant microwave? 😏🔥 😂
Not the largest sorry guy
VFD!
Oh dear, kind, gracious, Heavenly Father. Thank you for this bountiful earth, and all things you have provided us within it. Thank you for protecting us from the dangers of Evil. And thank you for  watching over the entire How Ridiculous team. I say these things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
this is terrifying i love it
ALrIghT GUyS NoW LeTS BloW uP ThE MonO lESa
THEY HAVE 18 MIL i remember watching them when they had like 500k
The refrigerator blended significantly better than I expected it to 😂
The golf balls in the blender was just about the most disappointing thing I have ever seen
Yeah, you guys should have something like the Blender connector cable located next to the power button so that if it starts smoking, you can quickly disconnect the power, and use that as the "emergency off switch" when it starts smoking, even if the generator is still on it's still gonna stop.
no flippin wayyyy🤣🤣🤣
That was intense at the end, I think that was the first time it really sank in how dangerous some of the things y’all do can possibly be sometimes
that was just sweet
44 club brings back thqt old question. Will it Blend?
This video is gonna be your most viewed! Love it!
I’ve been watching these guys for years, they’ve done some amazing stuff but this one is the best for me by far!!  Keep it up can’t wait for the next blender challenge!
Who comes up with these crazy stunts?   You probably should not have put it on Turbo.
Who gave you permission to steal North Koreas particle accelerator?
As a test engineer in my early engineering days, our lab used to test all kinds of motors (actuators), e.g., door lock, window lift, antenna, wipers, etc.  One thing these motors all had in common was the ability for its internal circuit breaker to engage when the motor would overheat.  That would break the circuit and prevent the motor from catching fire, which would definitely suck.  That may be what is causing your shutdown.
You initiated a resonance cascade.
This is the goddamndest thing I've ever seen on this channel
One of you could have survived that surfboard, for a few seconds. Ride it!
Dan the fabricator did a good job balancing that blade
Time to buy some new underwear… and some new pants
Build a gigantic vacuum for the messes and then see what kind of carnage you can create!!!
Okay. You just did the most insane thing ever done on this channel. >.<  My suggestion: Build a propeller to lift pieces up again. And go up to 10k rpm!!!!
Gaunson was holding it together until the end.
when the blender starts it hurts in my ears
You boys always seem to find new ways to push the “boys will be boys without parental supervision” envelope. This is one of the wildest ideas you’ve had yet.
i have to say my mouth was on the floor with the first one you guys are nuts keep up the fantastic vids my dudes
Was anyone else thinking to blend the cow that was mooing in the beginning?
Crazy how fast that thing spools up
This channel is the definition of "Men will be men"
It’s like something you’d expect to see in a saw film…
Now, THAT'S ridiculous! Great one!
I like how you guys kind of re-created the Chernobyl AZ-5 disaster with that last one. Pressing the emergency stop button *really* should work, and it can be disastrous when it doesn't!  Great video though, what an awesome idea. <3
Hey guys. I want to make a little suggestion with ya. I want you to put the hammer on the axe and try to smash rupert’s drop!
dang, you outdone yourself
German tounge twister :der Whisky mixer Mixed den Whisky in der Whiskymixerba That means:the Whisky Blender Mixed the Whisky in the Whiskyblenderbar  The Problem of the tounge twister is when you say it you will be saying wichser that means  Wanker
How ridiculous? Infinitely How entertaining? Infinitely more than Hollywood 😅😅
WHAT AN EMOTIONAL  ROLLERCOASTER!!!!!!!!!!!!
For a moment Gaunsons hat made me think he dyed his hair green
Thank you for reassuring us that Scott was safe ❤
Whenever an Aussie says "Whoa look it's a spider!", my ears perk up.  Aussie spiders are something else.
reminds me of happy wheels
don't breath this.
That blender is Aggressive!
Will it blend x 1000 😂
Why is it that the blenders being blended seemed almost poetic?
The belt was smoking, the emergency shut off didn't work because it didn't recognize an issue that's in the programming !! There is a fault somewhere.     It went Rouge  that was so awesome 👌
Blend blend-tech blenders!
I’m 47 seconds in and I really hope you guy brought replacement panels 😂😅
Jeez, I feel like you crazy blokes almost literally got pinned there!!! When it didn’t stop thought it would explode somehow. Ultimate irony for Derek to go via a golf ball - first time he’d have made a good connection with one :D
We’re going to blend the blenders!  Space Time Continuum: Nooooooo!
Everyone knows you need liquid for a proper blend.
Holy fricking shit is this Big
Need to put a 50 lb bag of flower in there. Ooooo or maybe (5) diffrent colors  of dyed flour. ;)
BlendTec would be proud!
Whoa, golf ball smoke, don’t breathe this
Shyco
Golf balls have been known to explode
Good to see safety first. Scott Gaunson V.S worlds largest blender is not a video I want to see pop up on the channel.
You guys need to turn it up to 11
When the blender start up noise is identical to helicopter you know it's gonna be good.
blender just went into overdrive
Love the Will It Blend mentality!
should have tarped outside the door of the blender
how ridionkulous is it mr breast and mark roober had a child
Legends!
Such a good episode!
Blender vs basketballs
just when i think that you three can’t continue to surprise me. i’ve been watching your videos for years and i love that y’all still go at it!
Because this has a part 2, does that mean we are only the 22 club today?
Attempt 1 of pitching my idea that you boys make a giant trebuchet and see how many things you can crush with random heavy objects. Think of the accuracy games you could play! GoPro on a boulder for a mega trebuchet launch? Yes please! You can even dress the part in medieval cosplay 😂
Put a safe in the blendee
this was def the best thing you have done with the spin motor because everything is contained. no wonders if the phantom will miss anything or if things wont line up with whatever is hitting it due to timing  fix it n dump the golfballs in when its on next time so it doesnt suck and kill everything
cows in background one said to other not today Mabel not today 😂😂😂
You may want to wire that Emergency Stop directly in series with your power supply next time.  And get a lever style switch, not those terrible pieces of Chinese crap.
Shredder the Blender
I thought I was going to see an EXPLOSION!!!
"People think you can learn the English language ...they're wrong. You have to memorize it." -Scott Gaunson, 2023
Anyone else’s anxiety just go down after finding out blender gets unplugged 🙃
Oh man blendy the kill machine is so great.
OK you need a water tight vessel and really blend some liquids!
I downloaded in 1080 for 35 minutes to get the full effect, my word
Shame you didn’t blend Herron
Blend-tech blenders:  Will it blend?  How Ridiculous:  Hold my blender...
why something bad happens, seams everyone forgets you can just pull the plug. dont know why.
I can't believe you didn't make that dial go up to 11
Did not know I wanted something like this til I saw it
The red and green buttons that did nothing were a sign of things to come 😂.
There's a sick part of me that always wonders what these chaotic contraptions would do to a cadaver.
another weapon in there arsenal
Love the vid. But not going to lie E-Stop not working I'd s bit worrying
15:41 speed control tad cooked a bit I think lads
jigsaw taking notes frfr
I think the problem was that the dial was set to zero when they blended the fridge
I think what might’ve been happening is the golf balls were too dense for the amount of grip you get out of just those two drive belts, I don’t think the motor was smoking but rather the belts were slipping and causing that smell and smoke similar to a burnt clutch. Perhaps try adding another belt and pulley on each shaft. Should solve that issue.
A wise man once said   “If there’s one thing you don’t put in your blender it’s a bowling ball”. 😂
Diesel Runaway, at least thats how it appears.
Turn it up to √-16!
Reminds me of the will it blend in the early 2000s
Will it blend?
error 56 said fuck all stops
This reminds me of "Will it Blend" by the creator of Blendtec, but way bigger!
At 10:03 ... Fs in chat for Spiderbro.
you can increase the strength of your multi-layer walls by chemically welding the layers of polycarbonate together (it's also way cheaper than crossing the 5cm (2") threshold where cost per square meter skyrockets).
The most tennis balls juggled at one time ever..................................
First time ever that they did a part 2 in a long form video
wow
There was supposed to be a forty-four after the three please add it
best vid in ages my dudes
I shit you not, i got the video recommended to me at the end of the video.
Tonight's lottery numbers are...
It's good but it will never beat Giant Axe
LETS GOOOOOOO!  BLENDERCEPTION!
You guys made that last one sound like the Half Life resonance cascade. Looked like it too.
These guys are really makeing good use out of that bat copter motor
You took "will it blend" to whole another level!
Did you guys have a backwards signal somehow? Your wiring needs work too if the E-stop couldn't break power. Good luck figuring out what went wrong and how to prevent the same from happening again!
Looking at the cows in the background and I just started the video but I'm trying to decide if they're going to put a cow in the blender
Ya definitely feel like the blade should get up to speed before the item is added. Every time it went wrong was because the item was added while the motor was off. Super cool still!!
A giant blender? HOW RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!!!
I really thought that the blender was about to explode.
I'd love to know why the emergency stop didn't work,  and what you could do to rectify that.
Gaunson: "I wanna know if anything is broken" 1:26  The internet Gaunson, you have broken internet
10:00 Australia moment.
Not gonna lie, this was pretty awesome.
okay do it again, but with a human on the surfboard
Golf ball clip sounded about as loud as the ball dispenser at my driving range
I hope we get to see multiple bowling balls at once next time!
I never thought I'd see the day when a bowling ball gets blended.  I say that as im watching a refrigerator also gets blended...😂
How's it going with the crusher made into the shape of rexies head
Was a little sad to see the surfboard go but the fact it literally surfed over giant spinning blades is the perfect way it could've went
maybe reduce your RPM's in favor of upping your Torques...
You guys often do wild stuff, but as soon as an industrial machine like that a) does not respond to commands, and b) does not shut down when an E-stop is pressed, you needed to stop production and have an outside professional help you.  Just one of those failures could result in career ending damage and both together sound unforgivably dangerous.
The 1st time I can say I saw someone put a TV in a blender 🤣🤣🤣
You guys need to make a t-shirt series, with a different set of broken objects on the front, along with the thing that broke it, with the words "will that's not in one piece anymore" written on the back...
Will it blend? That is the question!!
Next time they have to make the windows out of aluminum oxynitride.
When Aliens do come to earth, I wonder if this channel will be mystifying to them, or if the allure of pitching random stuff into a giant blender is universal.
Was that the real noise of the blades spinning or added effect? Because that is so terrifyingly loud
Somehow cows as Guineas in aus is cool !!
0:20 using drills with an extension is a good way to lose torque... unless that has a spec and that is a torque stick... then I'll shut up.
I must say this is WAY cooler than I thought it would be.  Awesome
Now we just need a funny clown on a tricicle 😊
Yippie
Just pray that the guy who rented the generator to you doesn't watch this video.
How ridiculous never and i mean NEVER manages to disappoint thanks 👍
Coolbeens
This is literally will it blend on steroids
Bro... the ending
i say they need a blendtec colab
"Mom, how did dinosaurs go extinct?"  *grabs Rexy*  "See this blender little Timmy?"
You should probably wear masks breathing all that , seems hazardous.. 😅
I wouldn't have the nuts to get in there to bolt the blades on. 😮
Will just say everything that was destroyed by the blender can be the protein for the monster shake
next series ,,,, "will it mend??" staring you three and a pallet of supperglue😂
Should throw that cow inside the blender
This is the most terrifying thing I think I’ve ever seen
Put spray paint in with merch on the walls
You guys are just damn mad, and I love it.
you did this at 8 o'clock exactly
So when are you going to make the worlds largest smoothy!
Ridiculous speed level needed
By far the best the best video ever. 😂👍
So mental mate
Make a giant notification bell. The amount of times you’d probably use it for “get the bell on” is uncountable
I know it isn't a lot but it's all I had and wanted to give it to my favourite content creators on the platform
This is going to be your most viewed video !
Don’t breathe this!
This video definitely deserve a 👍. This must never end i wanna see everything blended!!!
This is awesome
I have a feeling this is illegal
Put a physical E Stop on the main power wire to the blender, simple enough ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Will it Blend..  Blender smoke, dont breath that!
AWSOME
Ludacris speed!!
On note of "Nah, that's not cool...", the Emergency Stop not stopping it is a really serious problem. I hope Part 2 includes a breakdown of what happened, and what you did to fix it. All the guys there deserve to go home to their families at night; please don't take risks that you can't manage.👍🇦🇺
Science!!!!!!!!!
3:50 I probably don't need to say it, but a true lockout would be putting a lockout block on the end of the power cord running to the blender, so that it literally cannot be plugged back in. And Gaunson would have the key to the lockout.
Month of Margaritas
That thing is f**ing terrifying!!  Please, PLEASE give us all the slo-mo goodness in the next episode!! 🙏
shouldnt have set it to turbo psycho speed
I guess aussie spiders are greatly overexaggerated
next time you need a good SLO MO CAM
The estop not working is a bit worrying. Better keep someone by the genny! Love the video. Need to try blending a sofa!
About the most ridiculous how ridiculous that I’ve seen in many years of ridiculousness.
you should round off the edges instead of having a rectangle blender that way nothing can get stuck in the corner. either way amazing video guys.
where are the slowies?
POV. That’s my fridge.😢😢😢
Hi
That poor motor. And what a strong motor it is! I reckon this is gonna get boring quickly though, in all honesty
How good!!!!
“E-Stop didn’t turn it off, E-Stop has to turn it off.”
This is the most brilliant thing I've seen on YouTube, if there is any good in the world this video should cure cancer
The board surfing to the very end was almost poetic
I don’t know how to explain it, but the tv drop made my fingernails hurt
This is the best thing ever!
Wow, dove right into it, very short intro. I was so confused, but just went with the blend.
Pool noodles?
I'm surprised, Mr. Beast didn't think of this
Golf ball reactor overload!
Patent this and sell it to whatever country will adopt using it for their most hardcore, unable to be rehabilitated criminals for the views. Needs more torque and stiffer/stronger blades.
You boys have found a new way to recycle a bunch of stuff hahaha
Worlds biggest lawn mower should be next
Man! I puckered up just seeing those blades spin up! 😵
Did you forget that you could unplug it?
15:54 failed the MED
Fantastic & I love it ❤️Thanks HR 😂
How ridiculous are the goat of youtube
Epic Bros 😂
Aussies should know a lot about escapees, that’s how their country began!
there's something deeply unsettling about the blade looking like it's going slowly when you know it's actually going very, very fast. Great Vid!
ive been watching this channel for years. i was there when y'all dropped lawn darts into ooblek. now youre dropping things into the MEGA BLENDER lets go boys! : D
The ending was crazy.
BEST ONE YET GUYS 🎉
W at 15mins
Can’t stop it damb
You should throw a ballistics dummy in there
I am all the way in Florida.  When the Magic Smoke was coming out of the Generator, I was ducking my head between my shoulders. The Big Rexy in the sky was looking out for you Gentlemen.
Bendi the Blender is going to blend everything you guys wanna cut to shreds ^^ this vid was insanely good ^^
If the cows are safe out there then why aren't you standing out there with them? 😢
How good? Soooooooo Goooooooood! Love this! Keep it up, you guys are the best!
Il 15:09 bumuiysbits only trynntongetbupnto deep yea
Something about the mix of power and theatrics (the blender), make this video a complete stand out. Next level, boys!
i need to see more of this
But can it blend an anvil?
Dang...chose club heads sold as fast as that blender. 😢😢😢
There was a fatal flaw in AZ5
Make a smoothie out of people
Can you shred a signed t shirt and send it to me
This is really unique! Great job 👏
prediction: .5 million subs gained from this vid.  bravo guys.
Love how he missspelled psycho
❤❤❤❤❤😂😅😊😊😊😊
What did the blenders ever do to you
If this "How Ridiculous" thing does not work out,  the Mates could go into the recycling business with this oversized blender.
That should be used on pedifiles!! 😂❤
IF your motor is a belt drive to the blender shaft, it may have been smoking the belt from the resistance of the golf balls
What!!!
that was pretty pshyco 🤣
The end of all things
They should try to blend polycarbonate or even bulletproof glass. Or they could also try to blend Rexys.
Kinda bummed you didn’t drop the cow in there
the ultimate willl it blend lol
Stamfords hair and beard are really coming along. He's literally 2 weeks, a tabard and 1 less shoe from being Adam sandlers caddy!😅
"This could be the greatest moment of our Youtube careers. It could also become just, like, nothing. As in, the motor might just go, 'Er.' Foreshadowing.
Idea do this stuff with a ballistic labs torso
the red blender reminded me of one terribly unpleasant video (
You lads never  jear of turn it up to 11 ehh matess?
I was watching the replay of the airbag and the bowling ball. I wonder how high could you get a bowling to go? NO ROCKETS!!!
Part 2 please!!!❤❤❤
I ... honestly did not expect that to happen to the bowling ball... 😂
I Wana party with you boys some day lol
This is the best idea yet by far!
The giant blender is an odd thing to come across just randomly standing in a pasture lmao
The surfboard didn't deserve to die
hahaha  Never a dull moment with you guys! The best. hahahahaha
That one guy looks like Adam Scott?
You guys seriously crack me up! Such a great dose of levity to watch these on a work break. "Our buttons that mean nothing..."
Absolutely love the blender. Mr Blendsworth If you might? Thicker polycarbonate sides and some AR-500 (battle bot) steel blades. Killer machine
That’s was effing intense!!! Part 2 going to be Lit!
petition to name the blender “The Psiychlone”
11?
Do they clean up after?
Brilliant video guys 😅
Rip spider
You gotta fill it with rexi's.
escapeesss lol
Will It Blend taken to the next EXTREME level, I love it !
Yooooo when the emergency stop don't work, you know you've created a deadly beast!!!!
I mean, one of these death machines will get one of them one day.
Awesome and also a nail biter😂
Put a coconut in it next to see what would it do to human skull
Dude that was intense. I seriously love seeing how you guys are all fun and games, but when something actually goes wrong, you’re all genuinely ready to help each other out and make sure everybody is safe. Super cool.
The blender sounds like an airplane taking off actually that’s pretty cool  0:26 Also the cow mooing was so funny
i think the more you put in the blender the more the single belt drive has to work, need more belts from the motor to the blade, love ya video guys always fun times
Cool you made my idea I sed you should do this back on your first kantar blade video couple months back
Next thing, your dropping the most expensive car in there 😂
Ridiculous smoke. Don't breathe this...
Certified Commander Tartar moment
The drive belt was smoking from the resistance caused by the density of the golf balls... it was probably pretty worn from the previous blends that stopped the blades. Good job, lads.
i had a different screen up at the beginning of this.....all I hear is worlds biggest blender, and what sounded like muffled screaming....and had to see who was tied up as if joking to put them in the blender... it was a cow.
This is your best invention ever! Spectacular levels of destruction! Looking forward to lots more of this!
Good on Stanford. I like the beard👍
Wow this is awesome
if yall do this again. PLEASE wdit out the high pitched motor whine when you start it up. my ears are bleeding
Best creation yet
plot twist that wasnt a bowling ball that was a giant jaw breaker
Remember that guy.....Will it Blend? Everything he blended in one go in this thing.
The psyco part had me dying
Come on guys, let's get back to dropping stuff off of the dams ...please.............
It’s got to be some sort of world record, right?
Wow! You could blend upwards of around 10 politicians in that thing…..
Goreson having a mare 😅
At this point you’re just creating garbage literally…😂
How did you guys not think of "ludicrous speed"?
My husband's first language growing up was Spanish. Sometimes,  he'll ask me how to spell things in English. I will spell it, then say "Why? Because English!" English is a ridiculous language!
Sees a highly venomous spider and flicks it like a booger 😂 that’s some Aussie shit right there
You should blend a blender blending a blender blending a blender being blended NY the largest blender
lmao.. best vid for a bit lads
That moment when you create a massive oversized death machine and it randomly decides it wants to keep going...
This is the best episode of "Will It Blend?" ever!
I would actually pay money to see you drop full ballistic dummy lab dummies into that blender
If the guy from the OG youtube series "Will It Blend" is still alive, you guys 100% need to get him out there to experience this beast. It'd be awesome to see someone I saw like 2 decades ago be apart of this, if only just to witness.
I don’t know what’s wrong with people… 41K views so far and only 3.5k likes 😮… this is one of the most ridiculous things you guys have ever put together and I can’t wait for part 2. People need to turn off their autopilot and smash that like button 😂
Emergency Stop was a fake button too 😆
What a start!
I wish I had this as a kid, but I might not have made it to now.
Any
why yall screaming
W000 **instant like** Strapping myself in for a blendtastic show! 😁😁
"Whew, golfball smoke. Don't breathe that!"
Huge respect for trouble shooting the beast, for our enjoyment
I think I smelled the something burnt from where I’m sitting
You guys are going to break the world one day
Don’t stand in the blender and wash it🤦‍♂ That’s the internsˋ job
Run away blender!
You need to get real Polycarbonate.   Those windows are NOT polycarbonate.
Finally something where I don't feel bad for you picking up all that stuff everytime.
Hi
Great vid boys, stay safe!
Ballistic gel dummy with all of the innards would be cool to watch.
The sequel to the “will it blend” YouTube channel
sound like you had a run away descale  motor ... whee the  motor race  up with out stopping
All of your videos are favorites in our house, but this is the first video where my mouth was wide open the entire time, with a huge smile on my face. This was absolutely insane. LOL!
That surfboard made sure to have one last surf on the blades before the blender mulched it
You needed to invite the blendex guy, Bowling ball dust... dont breath this.
"Will It Blend" walked so you guys could run 🫡
I love how calm E Jack is when the e stop didn't work
A TV ago? I thought us Americans were the only one that would use anything for measuring except the metric system.
You guys have outdone yourselves again. Nice work
Possibly the best thing you guys have ever created! haha its so good!
I'm speechless. For both good and bad reasons. Just speechless.
Dude! Blend a big amount of weed and make the biggest joint in the world :D
Y'all ain't right.
no slo mo?
Is the directors cut one of those cows going missing and the blender turned red?
😢 poor golf clubs😢
Being this is Australia, I'm sure that spider had enough lethal venom to kill 50 adults.
If you put a single gummy bear in that Monster blender, it probably wouldn't blend lol.
I imagine the issue is that things are getting caught in the blades, which is causing extra torque. All the other models were uncontained, so anything that could have gotten caught up would have been sent flying or destroyed.
So what actually happened at the end? What was the cause of the smoke?
I laughed so hard at the "AWW, NO...." immediately after the unfortunate misspelling at 12:58.
I'm disappointed after the bowling ball the famous line wasn't said 😂
Legitimately the scariest part of any video you've uploaded so far was the blender error. Kinda bummed out we didn't get a slowie of it exploding, but hey at least we get a part two 😂
3:20 I think you should keep tat plug right next to the entrance of your bunker so you can unplug it at any moment.
Imagine the windows break
Surfing the blender
Bouncy balls next
I love this
Why the cow sound like that
When we wake up one morning and Australia is chopped up into islands, I know who I'm looking at.
Surf board was literally surfing in a blender.....
You should blend a bunch of Rexys in the big blender.
Emergency stop shouldn't be linked to a clutch or to disengage the drive, it should be to cut power. A breaker in the bunker is simple enough. Simple is best. No power, no drive
you guys need to get the Blendtec's Will It Blend guy on with this thing! lol
Wow.   I thought that the blender was gonna catch fire there, maybe even explode.   OO.     Would love to see a part 2, with better emergency shut down option's.     Safety first and foremost.
The Aussie incredibles
Had me at blender
I was legit worried I was going to see that thing catch on fire at the end.
I wonder what would happen if u filled it with water
Now this is Ridiculous 🤙🏼
We built a saw trap in real life! Contestants will have 44 minutes to escape or blend trying!
Wow, that is scary....
Eyyy, prolly got that golf set from the Cashies in Adelaide.  Rest in many pieces boys
E STOP on a par with the spelling (or spacing) of N. S. Gaunso!
Hopefully we get to see the world's largest smoothie in the near future.
You guys are a machine churning out this content. You even went back to the tower before. You’re awesome.
FUCK YES THIS IS AWESOME!
So cool l love it
This was quite possibly the most hectic thing they've ever done and I love it!!! Genuinely got a little worried when the e-stop didn't work though. Stay safe out there lads!!!
Just when u think it can get any better.  Love yall
Amazing new idea. Loved it.
Haha nice! You guys should try doing it with a human!
Why....no slow mo guys? 😂
Terrifying!   😅
"Well that's certainly not in one piece anymore." Best line ever! 😄
"WILL IT BLEND?!?! Let's find out!" 😂
If it doesn't have a 'frappe' setting, it's not a blender
Reshaft the club heads an play pitch an put with em
Y"all are crazy!!!!!!!!!! 😂😂😂
This looks like a trap from the latest SAW movie.
Biggest bingo generator ever
Worlds largest Boston cooler
Put....put a cow in it.
How Ridiculous!
Don't breathe this.
I HOPE THESE GUYS NEVER GROW UP, AND KEEP HAVING FUN, SO I CAN LIVE THROUGH THEM TO ENJOY ALL THIS GREAT DESTRUCTION, AND GOOFY FUN THE HAVE.
The things y’all do are absolutely pointless and that’s what makes them absolutely amazing.
Still need to achieve Ludicrous speed.  Let me know when you've gone to plaid.
I wonder if the golf balls were causing too much resistance for the belt to keep traction? The smoke might have just been from the belt slipping. That doesn't explain the failure to stop, but I would definitely rather smoke come from a belt than the motor, or circuitry. I hope whatever it is has a cheap fix. This was a great vid! I want to see more stuff in the blender!
This has been the most fun video in a long time.
Fluffing awesome vid.
The first word coming to my mind seeing the thumbnail was literally how ridiculous!!
you should get a  ballistic   dummy  to drop in just get one with no  blood
re the power surge, you may need to a larger size power cable as every time the blades slow down, the current draw is going to increase. the slower the blades spin the higher the torque. these types of motors are self torque adjusting. the torque comes from the speed differential between the stator and the rotor. thus, the closer to unity, the lower the torque and lower the current draw, the higher the delta the more torque and more current draw. this is at the motor level and irrespective of if you have a VSD or not. For an application such as this, it may be worth removing the VSD and running it DOL to allow you have to 'more' overall power at the expense of not having speed control. also seems like the contactor welded shut. which is why the e-stop didn't stop it, as if the contactor was welded, then dropping power from the contactor coil won't help.
4:13 WILL IT BLEND BLENDTECH
Right from the start of blending the blenders I knew this was going to be a great video🤣
6:08  Such a nostalgic sound.
You guys are borderline insane 😂, greatest thing ever.
it's so strange that they are selling blended shit   edit: grammar
OMGGG THE GOLFBALLS WERE SO SCARY! Like fr if something doesn’t go right I feel like we gonna die 😂😂
I’m new here. What does Forty Four mean?
I mean, you had a giant red button there the whole time 🔴
Clean up may have needed more protection there thats alot of chemicals in those appliances especially the plasma tv
Will It Blend? - 2023, colorized.
You outdid yourself!
I know it probably isnt, but i like to think that was the bag of golf clubs from dankpods' cashies
You need to do asmr videos with just the eye level view and not the direct down view please!!  With sounds and another one without sounds
You have a giant arsenal of items and then stop the video comrade
if that's what it does to the fridge at power level 0, i'd love to see what it does at 3
Need to do a few thousand orbeeze on the slow mo
just saying a ship container is not that safe
I would love to see a behind the scenes for this episode. The process to build the blender seems fascinating
10:22 well we know now
Ground beef anyone?
Fill it with orbeez and turn it on
All the tennis balls made it look like a gumball machine.
Please send me all those GOLF BALLS PLEASE!!! ❤️
Likely was the belt burning under the blender. As the balls slowed the blade down and motor kept going.
This video is EPIC. You all never disappoint!!! Watching from Indianapolis Indiana
I'm only a minute in, and this is the greatest thing I have ever seen.
You really should have dropped SEVERAL 5 Gallon jugs of ice cream in at once.....
This is the greatest thing I’ve ever seen.
Props for keeping the hairy scary bum hole dairy moment in.
As a fridge mechanic, I want to know if you de-gas the fridges, or if you use fridges with r-600a, which is fine to release in the air
These lads never run out of ideas for some of the best content around. Banger upload as always 🔥
Hope you guys are extremely carefully loading that thing. Hope to enjoy you're videos for a long time
47 minutes babyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Every time the blades start revving i keep waiting for gta san andreas theme song to play
I think you should pour paint over the blades to color shirts or try rexies and oblec
how are you getting rid of all that landfill  you just made?
did it really not stop???
Absolute Legends!
First a Hammer, then an Axe, and now a Bleder. Yall are insane
Yay I’m here within the first hour, that’s the first time for me. Also this is a good vid.
Ayy, suggested this a while back on one of the vids with the spinning blades / swords. Glad to see they had the same idea! :D
I'm 47 minutes early
you should drop a ballistic dummy.
they are wasting so much money for us 🫡
Ah yes we finally have a way to get rid of the bodies.
I understood that jim carrey reference
More Fruit!! Like an actual smoothie, just giant and Ridiculous!!
put the worlds largest cat inside it.
here before 50k views
Belts were smoking on the motor. An the rpm jump was it gripping up on the pulley
This is one of the best
What about 44club at the end of the video¿
Psycho
Sees a potentially venous spider then proceeds to flick it out of existence is the most Australian thing I’ve ever seen.
Imagine a person falling in.. sheesh
Part 2:Drop a pool with water in it (maybee it will break smt electrical but if not then yeet it in)
Love from Pakistan
"That could be the end of all things...." LOL so good!
that had me rolling in laughter for the whole vid - great job!
Mmmmmm, my favorite smoothie. Surfboard, bowling ball, refrigerator, and television.
The bowling ball and golf stick part was fantastic Love to watch your vides  Love from Pakistan❤
We need to get the slow mo guys in on this action
You know its gunna be a good video if you say wtf to yourself after reading the title 😂
40 minutes
sikco
Gumballs, Do Gumballs
As a surfer, it was SO PAINFUL seeing that board getting chopped 😢
you guys should bring the blendtec guy in and have him blend a bunch of blendtec blenders
at least this helps with cleaning besides some things can still escape thro the roof and the sides
4:35 tennis ball explosion!
that last blend is why you need a physical killswitch that cuts the main power line with enough distance between the poles to prevent arcing
Garry's Mod
I’m surprised the walls didn’t shatter or cave!
im starting to think they are going to make  giant slingshot and launch things.                                           I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words cannot describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax; it had insanely excellent detail. Oh, and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen, better than any of the books I have read.  Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair.  It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply.  This is an absolute masterpiece, I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the chip go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. It absolutely moved my soul, and I don't think I can ever be the same. This chip has changed my entire mental state, I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. I have forgiven all my enemies, and now I am a man of a pacifist life.  I will move on, gotta move on, as the song says. The chip is so inspirational, it shares its vast wisdom with all of us, and we are all so lucky that it would bestow its great words with us. We are all children of the chip. Hail chip. Hail chip.  The spinning chip, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a chip do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the chip spins, showing its lightly salt-covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the chip scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor. The flavor, music, and everything can be heard, tasted, seen, and felt from a screen.  You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating chip. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any chip I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life-changing. This is one of the greatest works from a chip I have ever seen especially on 17:24.  The work put into this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has reminded me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life.  I am crying. This has made me go through an emotional rollercoaster. I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. Thank you.
Yo, my poor spider bro didn’t deserve that 😢he was leaving
Absolute peak HR! 😆
Now this is the best video ever made 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Will it blend, that is the question?
Absolutely awesome video  The surf board was my fave just surfing the waves 🌊  🏄‍♂️
This has to be the 1st time in history a refrigerator has been blended.
Like Spaceballs, you need LUDICROUS SPEED 😁 Edit -  never mind,  looks like you reached ludicrous speed and everything went wrong in the process.  Good show fellas
Looks like the cashies golf bag dank pods showed.
Im so glad to see the helicopter repurposed! I love the blender! Its a lot more exciting than the copter was!
Great video
I’m sure y’all are the first to blend a blender
That was crazy
How ridiculous. This video LITERALLY got 50k views in just 45 minutes
As people say, you know the blades are spinning fast when it starts going backwards...
2:26 the surf board will remain in our hearts! ❤️🫡
Proof you cannot predict anything.
The drama, the suspense! Will PSYCʜO spin again?
now this is a bloody big flash back
Can not friggin wait for pt2. That was just ace 😂👌
Lovely blender of death
Super scary moment with the E-Stop not working! Relieved that you all got through that safely
did you press the red button?
Boys!!! I held my breath the entire last few minutes of the video...!!! Am thankful that y'all are fine ... Alhamdulillah
Awesome!!!
Ha Ha absolutely love your vids but this is theeeee best :)
I don't know how this struck any of you is this a good idea, but hey, it was for the internet and I'm glad you tried it!
This.... This is content
This is easily the most dangerous thing you guys have made/done. Glad safety is top priority. Either way, absolutely nuts and I didn't expect it to survive the bowling ball.
The sound that thing makes as it goes up to speed. Nope.
Back to more hulk fist plz
Amagine blending a car comrade
I'm mildly disappointed the bowling ball didn't just smash out the side of the blender
i really hope you pay the cleaners well  they deserve a raise but i gotta say i absolutely love your videos, and i love the excitement
the surfboard surfing on the blades actually looked really sick! i can really see how much effort it took to make this!
I mean this is a great learning experience
Bro imagine meeting the man upstairs by an oversized blender🗿  P.S- Glad you lads were alright and one of the best vids yet!
You guys needed an ultra slow gopro right on the plastic, to capture the drop onto the blades
Blend a car 🚗🚗🚗🚗 plssssss
Has to be worlds largest blender
Stressful!
Will it blend? Yes.
B            L             E                       N                D                  E                 R
Very cool guys, well done!
the scariest thing about this video is watching a grown-ass man who did not know how to spell "psycho"
Best idea ever!
The dial should go to eleven.
The next obvious thing is the biggest chainsaw...
I love the Ave Ventura reference 🤣
Damn, YouTube recommend Is powerfull sensitive not good for me Too much anoying video and difficult to get good content recommendation like this
You are crazy  Man!
can you blend a cadaver for science
Dudes, this somehow ranks among your best videos ever! I enjoyed it so much I was laughing out loud and sorta freaked toward the end! Good job boys. Much love ❤
Is there a video on how the ridiculous blender was designed and made?
Boys where the phanty ?
The noise from that thing is terrifying
This thing is savage and I absolutely love it. How goooood
Nice cliffhanger fellas.
Banana why does my comment have so many likes
This was fucking amazing
Now you need to make the world's largest smoothie using the world's largest fruits (such as watermelon, jackfruit (only the edible parts though, don't get sick lmao), etc)
i cant believe they took the cashies clubs. Ol Dank's gonna miss em
I honestly though the blender was going      To blow because of the golfballs. Did anyone else think that to?
Industrial size blender
WOW
For me in the USA, seeing a spideron the set, I'm far more terrified for them in Australia, where everything seems more deadly.
I bet it’d look more like a snow globe if u put Rexies in there
This is amazing. Everything was epic!
You need an 11 on the dial…😂
I am very impressed with what this thing blended. I'm torn between the bowling ball and the fridge, as I didn't expect those results from either
Blend a whole cow.
I have to say that this is my new favorite contraption by the boys. So effin cool!!!!!
Sharper blades of better design. But maybe those simply are not practical and the blades were the best compromise.
I took a break, but been binging you guys lately. How good is their energy?!
The smell would've been the motor windings (epoxy impregnated) warming up and smoking.. or maybe the belt. The genny smoke is just typical diesel at max load.  I would've let the blades build up kinetic energy (speed) before dropping the balls in, then you'd have a better chance of blending them. Need lot of speed and sharpness to do it.
Smashing that like button, and leaving any sort of comment is the best way to support your favorite creators 😊
Omg, that was terrifyingly awesome! Can't wait for part 2
Refrigerator smoke. Don’t breathe this.
okay this is actually one of the better videos ive seen from you guys! well done!
It's like these guys are doing everything I wished I could when I was about ten years old. Thank goodness this channel exists.
I think you missed a huge opportunity!! Ice,  margarita mix and tequila 🤪
I like that How ridiculous have their own crazy massive ideas rather than copying other content creators. This one was a good one! Very much appreciated.
How long did it take to clean up the mess around the blender lol... I can see it taking almost as long as the actual blending haha
As a guy who used to work on removing the canister so fridgefreezers of all sizes and shapes could be safely discarded watching that fridge which was the smallest in uprights we did was beautiful.  Chest freezer next full of rexies and orbees.
This episode was awesome af omg.
This is by far the best thing you ever built. Greetings from Brazil!
They should give them prop buttons to leaders who have nuclear weapons 😂😂😂
No comment needed to be made. It is a giant blender. What more needs to be said?
Almost witnessed the early end to the blend!
Watermelon sugar high
Finally a blender to rival the blendtec 😂
Put one cow into the blender.😊
How could this possibly go wrong? however, it will be epic.  Edit: finishing the video; I was joking about it going wrong.
golf ball smoke. Don't breathe this
This is amazing
Micro plastics.
the ending was a madness
Anyone else hear the beginning of the GTA San Andreas theme song when the blades get really fast
Should have powered it up first before putting the fridge in
1:08  you blokes ever given thought how ya gonna clean it out?
Finally a blender to rival the blendtec. And the willitblend channel. 😂
that was amazing and I'm glad you guys are okay ^.^
haha e stop not working
My fav aussies are back
Now you should turn it into one them fan money machines from the game shows and one of you should be in it with things.... obviously soft things that won't kill you
The power surge could be because you have your new blender set to 0 each time it cut out 😂
Do you have pitch meetings where you have to convince someone to fund your projects who is already thinking "Oh god, what bat shit crazy way to accidentally kill someone have they found this time"? Because I would love to witness such a meeting. Also thank you for doing this.
Insane💯
I didn't think giant blender would be any good. But, hats off chaps it's brilliant!
Gives "Will it blend?" a whole new meaning lmfao
World's biggest margarita anyone? 😂 This is amazing I love it
It's a microplastic factory!  Microplastics in your food, in your bloodstream, in the air that you breathe and in your brain. Enjoy!
you guys are nuts but i love it ;-)
@DailyDoseOfInternet
One of my favourite videos you've ever done❤
If anyone ever wondered what it’s like to be entrained in the high winds of a tornado…..I’ve always described like a blender.
Male audience right now😮😮😮
You boys have really out done yourselves.  This is premium content!
3:15 I didn't think they were going to sing Harry Styles in this video🤣
This is my newest favorite thing.
You boys better have pet the cows on your way out (assuming you were allowed to)
This is my favorite thing you guys have done since you moved away from the tower. Can’t wait to see what you do with it next!
I want to see them in reverse
Could use that blender for bulking
Their thumbnails always looks like click bait. But luckily it never is, these guys are truly greate No i am no a bot
44 tower. Who misses the 44 Tower 👇
You should have used a small internal combustion engine like an old honda engine or maybe diesel one for the torque. Easy to control, no separate generator.
"Dont breathe this...." 🙃😉
i have always secretly hoped for a massive fail of whatever you destroy things with but dam....can't wait for part 2
How can you be a guy and not be extremely satisfied with this master piece
Get a whole bunch of watermelons in there but with them sprayed with the indestructible black latex material. Also, that ended with a true "Motor smoke, don't breathe this!" moment at the end.
2:03 best part XDD thank meh later
You should put a test dummy in it, one with blood in it so we know what would happen if we made a human smoothie
I like that the surfboard had one last surf
Easily one of the best videos yall have done!
The only thing missing is having a cameo from Tom Dickson
I never would have thout of making a giant blender 😆 U mob continue to amaze me 💯
How does Gaunson say " Well, that's not in one piece anymore " without moving his lips? 🤣 He's a Psyco!
And did blender Vs blender comrade
I love what you guys come up with to entertain the world
Was your emergency stop software based?  Because anybody who owns a PC knows that doesn't work lol.
you guys are nuts, even for Aussies! But yeah, I felt you guys had had it for a moment or two!
Welp... You've done it again Boyz! So freaking neat and fun to watch. Rubberband ball in the blender!
I need a How Ridiculous horror movie
Also, I think you do owe it to yourselves to make the guinness book of world records largest smoothie. Because I'm positive nobody has blended it all at once!
When I thought you couldn't find something more crazy to try...
My favorite vid so far and ive only seen 2 mins
It was good Comrade
Greatest
This is the first time the sight of one of your thumbnails has made me say “What” out loud.
Dang these guys really moved up from dropping things on things.
That was the most epic video i ever seen❤
I missed the sofa tv, canoe, dishwasher  most of the good stuff was left out.
I blended inflatable strawberries filed with rexys comrade
genious
This is insane! I love it
My face hurts from laughing so much looking forward to part2😂😂😂
You can’t blend the blenda!
Admit it. Everyone wanted it to explode
I think....we need to blend a pig corpse....
This is by FAR the most terrifying thing you guys have ever built.
Привет
Ive been waiting for this since the community post and i can say it did not dissapoint.
Where is the "Well that's not in one piece anymore..." t-shirts?  With an exploded bowling ball... who's with me!!
I thought you guys are gonna drop in that cow🐄 also😂😂😂
We have multiple fail safes... Here's our one fail safe.
Why no Nun in the blender? I happen to like Twisted Sister.
The Mexican cartels would like to make an offer on that to dispose of….. you know…. Pesky other cartels
Y'all need to make a big milkshake.
PSIYCHO!
The years go by, and I can't imagine you guys ever out doing yourselves. But you always do... Giant blender might be the best idea I've ever seen on the internet.
You boys need to be commended. Whomever has the ideas for the implements of destruction, you're a dead set nutter; but in the best way. 😂 For the next time you bring out the blender, contemplate a top with a feeder tube so you can feed the golf balls in without overpowering  the motor/clutches. Secure the ball container to the top and let it rip.
So your thermal overload didn’t trip when it was supposed to. Totally an error in your variable speed drives 👍. Also make sure your E-stop isn’t being bypassed by a wire.
a dozen blacks are missing : "D
When are we blending bulletproof glass?
Those blades and poly-carbonate windows are putting in *work.* I thought the bowling ball would break it, then you stuck a *fridge* in there! Good stuff, all of it.
Yooooooooooo. Y’all are on to something with the mega-blender. Get the strongest blades possible and go crazy.
Craziest shizzle ever… bloody brilliant and hilarious (in a this shit could go sideways at any moment kinda way) 🤣
The best yet! 😎
What an ending!!!🏌🏼‍♂️💥
This is by far and away my favourite HR episode ever. Fantastic content lads.
Send the blenders in for warranty repair.
NO! Bad HR! Do not turn that thing back on until you know why the E-Stop didn't work and fix it.
I enjoyed the blended blenders. Great way to start.   A powder paint tornado might be fantastic.
Did not expect this to work sooooo well!!! Noice
So satisfying!
Wow
Thanks for the safety shoutout! I think it's important to not just be safe, but show an impressionable audience that you're being safe!
"Will it blend?" "Don't breathe this!"
We were all enjoying this so loudly even Mum wanted to join in the fun!
Absolutely loved it been waiting for this video since you put the poll up, what be a cool bit is give the blender a good clean after you finished blending things then just dump aload of fruit and veg in it make a big glass and have the world's biggest smoothie   Keep up the great work and the fantastic videos, hopefully you can come to the UK and do some whacky and cool stuff
Seriously terrifying that Emergency stop didnt work… what if there was an actual emergency that needs to be figured out by electricians
The ultimate "will it blend"
I would've died if he wrote "TURBhO" just to mess with Gaunson.
I am in absolute love with this new HR toy!!! (Glad y'all are safe too!)
"Definitely something happened" Gaunson 7:50
Super Blender neared gaining sentience.   This is how AI takes over the world.   (Someone mentioned human blender.   AI is the path to human blender!)  :D :D
1:55 i was hoping the San Andreas song would start playing
Imagine the fridge just started spinning with the blades and didn't fall in them😂
Thought the cow was gunna go in
Wow that's the craziest video yet
My fav was the bowling ball! I like bowling. It looked like a tornado.
This video was on a whole new level.
The blender was going to open a portal to another dimension with how fast it was going.
Great vid 👍
Shit hit the blender on this one. Stay safe!
Please don't waste food.🙏
whirlpool effect, made the blades spin faster with golf balls.
make the blender water proof and fill it up with water pls
Lol when I wonder how you fellas can go bigger and more ridiculous...you seem to come up with something that amazes me! Good on you for all your incredible success! Your Long Time Fan - MadHatterPops-
25m 2,4k l 27kw  00:26 6-8-2023
Next time, you should do various paint cans and then use the patterns on the poly carb to dab onto tshirts and see what designs you get. 😊
I have been suggesting this for awhile 😊
escapee ?
Best viddy this year I would say boys!
yo that was insane!! THAT PSYCHO SETTING WAS LEGIT PSYCHO!!
Scott just nonchalantly thumping a spider is the most Aussie thing I've ever seen 😂😂😂
Does anyone think of Happy Wheels with the blender?
I see alot of cows maybe you could blend a milkshake 😃😃
Do a box of printer paper next
Gaunson been hanging out with Shaggy and Scooby 🍃
Well none of that is in one piece anymore.
Blending a blender is absolutely GOAT content 😂
Wow what a dramatic end!  Out of control blender, run for your lives!   I loved how the golf clubs disintegrated.  I feel like doing that to my clubs after a bad round.
World's largest Mincer! (Not Gaunson doing the mince walk with bum implants). Imagine mincing a car! And you could convert it into a sausage maker! ( Not sure what you would use for giant sausage skins)? And Ok unless it's happened as I haven't watched the video.... What about blending a ballistics dummy lab full body (I know they do torso but maybe a special order)? If the ballistic dummy is a good idea please upvote me!
I think the E-Stop button was as fake as the start button!
The next supersized thing after you've made plenty of videos with this has to be a gigantic metal shredder :)
Ah yes the lads are back and are better than ever! How freaking good!
You let the magic smoke out.  No "e stop" will work without the magic smoke in it.
0:18 RTgame's twitch chat would be proud
The three most hated words on Youtube: To Be Continued.😡  That aside, you're all ok, and that is the most important thing.
Would love to have a signed golf club head!!
Y'all just take thoughts & bring it to the HIGHEST LEVEL!!!!
I'd love to be a fly on the wall when you guys come home to your significant others after one of these days. "So what did you do today, honey?".
10:02 😂😂
6:53 he’s westing good now, soon he’ll west in pieces.
Will it blend? That is the question.
Me from India , people staying next door asking me Can i borrow it to make Batter / Chutney for a while ? .
I don't know who had the idea for (or built) this one, but best contraption of the bunch! There were some really good ones in there. Shame no sun.
Wow.  If it had been up to me, there'd have been 6 or 8 faces on that blender instead of 4.  But not sure if it would've made the blender's window any stronger.
I can just hear "the machine" laughing maniacally "YOU WANT ME TO STOP?! HAHA WATCH THIS FOOLS!"
I could use a tv
How was this your most terrifying video yet and not the katana fan or something?
Damn that was wild!!! What a way to start my Saturday, got my heart going!!! Great vid guys
this has got to be hands down the best gadget yall ever created!!!! its GREAT keep it up you beautiful bastards
14:50 "We cant stop it" I was expecting an explosion
Their accents are the best.😂
"and on todays episode of 'will it blend?' ".....
One of your best videos.
Commtest for How Ridiculous: how many times have you guys dropped stuff from high places??
These people never stop with the insanely large things. 😂
The spider in the video is a Tigrosa annexa
There's something oddly satisfying about the giant blender shredding everything!
Imagine they make a massive toaster
You guys have finally answered the question of how to achieve maximum carnage with minimum clean up. 😂😂😂  Well done!!!
I love how they make things that could be used to kill others in the mater of seconds
Ooooohhhhhhh, THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
I’m ur number 1 fan pls comment on this commenr
You finally found something as cool as mAX-well!
Stanford looked like such a frightened little girl when it wouldn't shut down
You guys have done some crazy things before, but I think that a giant blender is the craziest
crank that VFD up to 120hz and let er eat
I’m surprised these guys aren’t minced meat from all the things they’ve done on this channel
carnage, awesome idea
“It’s self sustaining now. I can’t stop it” -Doc Ock
After many years of testing, the method of destruction with the easiest clean up has been determined.
yall put a lot of faith in a conex box
This is the greatest version of "will it blend?" that I've ever seen. But the e-stop not working... that's f'ing scary on a machine like that. Like seriously, seriously, _seriously_ scary.
This is the ultimate "for the boys" channel👍
I just love your reactions when things were blending 😂😂  I was waiting for an explosion at the end, but so glad you managed to shut it down 😮
They could have made the world's largest slushy from a single blend... With giant ice cubes of course.
Yessss! When I saw the members only video about this, I got so excited! 🎉🎉🎉
2:02 Aussie, Aussie, Aussie... Ow! Ow! Ow!
E-Stop be like 😈
18 minutes  finally
Wasting away again in Margaritaville, searching for my blender of balls...
I think the golf gods were punishing you all.
Yeah love the blender, perhaps do more for future content
16:04 😂😂😂😂😂😂
DON'T BREATHE THAT!
That was funny as boys.Electric motor playing funny buggers with ya ,bring on part II 🇦🇺👍👍👍
Smooth Smoothies! Clean that beast out and put a tap in the side before blending up a bunch of fruit and protein powder of choice.... then pour smoothies for the crew!
We want more!!!!
Were was the fantom footage? 😢
Fantastic video guys, loved it and cant wait for part 2 👌
Definitely need more of the blender!!!!!!
Brenda the Blender, thanks for the video
Guys this was SO FUN!!!
this is so insane! i love it!
Tennis balls were awesome :) Love your ideas! Greetings from Germany
"We have multiple fail safes just so you know"   *Unplugs blender*  So as you can see. We're safe.
Yall need a leaf sucker to clean up it would be on the easier side. 😂
I don’t know if it would work, but if you had the ingredients to elephants toothpaste in separate containers and drop them all in the blender at once. That would be sick!
That thing is violent for sure but I love it.
Incredible boys, love it lol
9:58 is a classic Aussie moment
The videos are coming back
That was the most epic of endings. I reckon you pumped the power so high the circuit bridged between the input and output sides and bypassed everything that could stop it. I bet if you had a camera under the vcd, youd have seen some terrific arcs
Put the world largest cat inside
This shouldn't be legal
Did we just watch Gaunson have a mini-stroke on camera?  Also, that ending was TENSE.
Prepare to go viral this was thoroughly entertaining!
Did anyone else notice that they have the serated edges of the blender blades pointed in the wrong direction ???? Look here.... 4:43
If they didnt blend a blender on this video then it wouldnt be right
Just finished a round of golf, scored 44 on both the front and back 9, and then here you guys go dropping a golf ball blend! It's fate!
Next make a giant smoothie!
We call that a run away. Scary stuff boys
I can't believe you killed the last remaining 10 iron on this planet. That things gotta be worth a million bux on its own😂
If I would’ve seen a spider it would be wraps. Pack it up. We are done. 😂😂
Me: See's cow, immediately checks the comments.
Collab with MrBeast and do 100 kids vs giant blender video
put 10 milion of fake money in it
A Tesla Car Battery would be 'explosive'!
What have you guys created…. Dear lord this is amazing
What about a giant fork?
Appreciate ya showing the device being unplugged before you open it.  That thing is violent.  🤣
Absolutely Ludicrous! Amazing Video!
BOYZ!  This got a thumbs up at like the 44 sec mark!!
The boys are getting dangerously close to  Jigsaw sponsorship lol
I can't really forgive that a guitar was on que to be chopped up.
I let the intrusive thoughts win....what would that do to a pig carcass.....
The cows in the back like 👁️👄👁️
Well, ya certainly don't want to get on the bad side of these boys now. May have been able to outrun the hammer and the axe, but the blender drop....NOPE.
GLENDA the blenda
i admit that if i was making money from youtube this is the kind of s...t that i would like to do
World's biggest milkshake needs to happen
Soon as I see your thumbnail I just can't wait for the rest
You guys need to blend a plane at some point lol
Why do I want to jump in it?
Wish i could give 1000 or more likes.....cant wait for pt.2
I'm interested to see what oobleck would do in there
Amazing video😛
Where is the slowie?
I find it ironic that one of their most destructive machines to date is also one of the most safest they've ever devised.
Would have loved to see the cow....
how ridiculous is becoming more ridiculous by the minute and im here for it
This is absolutely sick!
Definitely could use more fruit next time
If possible, could you put in a MASSIVE iceblock? Maybe with add stuff in to the iceblock like frozen paint etc for more effect?
Stop breaking nice thing, and break old and/or useless things. k thx bai
You forgot the golden rule of will it blend - DON'T BREATHE THAT! Wear some PPE and be safe!!
11:09 hole in one 😂😂
The golf balls though
This channel is the definition of limits are goals
We need more
Love the bigger focus on safety. Seen some dodgy things with the bow and arrows in the warehouse saga.
The blender series is going to be cool
You could blend that cow.
This is one of the best videos you guys have ever made. So entertaining!
These ideas keep getting crazier
Certified mental, you lot…. Good lord man….l 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
I have waited so long for this 🔥🔥🔥
This is an instant thumbs up 👍🏽
My favorite part was the surfboard surfing on the blender blades 😂
You guys never fail to amaze me with your new ideas!
This is genius, your best creation yet
Fun fact, watermelon is a vegetable not a fruit!
Worlds Largest SLAP CHOP… just sayin
Nothing but the best. Can't top this.
Gaunson in the video: In his head: how flippin good
Blender smoke Don't breath this
I'm an absolute nerd coz my first thought with the tennis balls was "this is the perfect representation of particles in motion"
The sound of that thing revving up is a thing of nightmares.  Fantastic work boys!  44 Club!
At 5:18 Ace Ventura Pet Detective
You should fill it with water and see the tornado that forms from it.
Now you guys need a bigger blender to blend the blender blending the blenders. Etc into infinity. Brilliant video. As if there were doubt.
You guys never fail to deliver.
What was your fave blend? #44Club
when i dont think they can out do themselves they DO NOT disappoints way to go guys!! Wonder if Mark Rober helped with this one too
Did you guys just use the engine from the helicopter/katana/flyswatter machine?
The surfboard taking its last ride till the end inside of a blender was poetic 😂  Blender surfboard shirts with Rex riding the board please!! in memory of surfy
Welcome to Will it Blend with How Ridiculous
I think you have found a way to solve the garbage problem, but you will need to make a massive compactor to put all the blended pieces in after blending.
you guys always make the most creative things ever
These guys have a right laugh 😂😂😂
Good to see you guys mix things up.
Well that's not in one piece anymore
How did you not have a setting for 44 on the blender? 😢
Put a ballistics dummy in it!!!!
I’m 30 sec in and already I think this is the best idea you guys have ever had!!!!
Next thing that must go into the world's largest Bass-O-Matic is  loads and loads of bass.  "That's good bass". (If you know you know)❤
Wow insane
Man could you imagine a person falling into that!?
An Ace Ventura line with a tennis ball, that's an ace for you 😂
Another masterpiece by the local country boys
Ok boys, thanks for turning up the content again. I was sour for a bit there. Bit of a content dip yeah? ❤ We even got the old tower back? 😮
This is so awesome!!! Thanks for building this!!
Only you guys!  lol

Rip cat
And on today's episode we blend Pedophiles!
I’m actually surprised you guys went about doing this, after seen the comments years ago asking for this I never though you would do it. Brilliant from you guys 😂

Shame on you for that surfboard
You meke me laugh so hard even if sad. Good job
For the men of youtube

Love from India ❤
Just when I thought you guys peeked at the samurai spinner, you come out with this thing! Keep it up!!!
That's using your noodle to convert that Big O motor you got into a different Contraption every time man!
How ridiculous? Very very ridiculous 😅
Oh this one is going to be a BANGER! Like if you want to see that thing blend up a bunch of Stretchy Shaqs!
Would've loved a slow-mo of the surf board 😂😂
Just started the video... but this looks like the most exciting, awesome, ridiculous thing yall have ever done! Can't wait!
No Miracle misses with this. Nice
Well and truly blended….  Way cool!
Will that make margaritas? We'll take two. 😂
Im glad y’all didn’t use text as a rest object this time! 😅
Holy. Shit.    I was not prepared for the awesomeness of the blender.
**cow makes noise** My intrusive thoughts: *blend him*
Dang
I'm going to need a smoothie now, and a really big cup.
You think they have peaked.....then they go again. How epic
This is the most Australian thing I’ve seen yet, especially flicking that spider away
That's was so cool the surf board was still surfing 😂😂
I F-ing Love These Guys
do not let a specifically fictional character named "Hank J. Wimbleton" see this *cough couch*
How many Horse power ? xD
This is terrifying in the best way. This might be the coolest thing you guys have made yet
Amazing!!!
