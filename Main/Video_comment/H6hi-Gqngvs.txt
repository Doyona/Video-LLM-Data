Virgil having Cillian Murphy's number whilst Gary can't even get a photo with him 😂
Capital of the Netherlands ifykyk
Joe Cole
Are they gonna redo this woth 20?
Yk how much times I've heard Van Dijk reference Barcelona. Not just in this interview but multiple other times😂  Really would've been a dream to have him at Barca but I knew he was too good and too loyal to leave Liverpool or for Liverpool to ever consider letting him go😭😭
Would be 20 questions if they did this now 😂😂
Penalty for my life, only one man - Salah! I love how he takes penalties, no games just bang!!
Ofcourse he loves WATER…he’s Dutch! 🇳🇱🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷
2025 and he is signing a new contract❤
Gary neville wow long tome not see
What an inspiration for greatness and humility. Outstanding human.
Me too ..James milner ❤
7:40 the second Gary Neville realizes he was not even allowed to take a pic with Cillian Murphy while Van Dijk has his number, cracked me up. Long live Gary, such a funny guy.
Has there ever been a footballer with a good taste in music? I very much doubt it. I wonder how he pays for those holidays. I would have loved if he had just said that football players are over-paid.
VVD is very humble and composed. Hope to have a pic with him one day
He is Adorable ❤Persona .   Beautifully Personality ❤
im his personal assistant, his favourite scent is b rouge by fragrance world
Agree about James Milner ,loved the interview.
Clark Kimberly White Joseph Harris John
Virgil seems very grounded and intelligent…..
Multi-millionaire Gary Neville saying the Maldives are too expensive?! 😂
Creed is the only aftershave you know that Gary!!!
Bro can't share his aftershave XD
Favorite drink non alcoholic... Water.. Cheers to Virgil 🎉❤
I think now his favourite moment would be him scoring the winning goal in the caraboa cup final
Virgil is just a lovely, humble guy. No arrogance , just down to earth but damn good looking 👌 💯 plus a fantastic footballer, too of  course 😊
Vvd absolutely dreadful hairstyle 😂😂😂😂
Don’t go to Maldives.
He'll pass the ball, calm as you like ....
nice interview but could have done with a few more shots of feet and drone footage of the tops of trees.
Legends say they’re still walking
What a great bloke 👍 I really enjoyed that interview.
I'm not surprised he chose James Milner. Safest bet :)
Neville “I was gonna go to the Maldives but it was a fortune” What?! Multiple properties and jobs working as pundit, his own football club……??? What?
7:39
He'll wash the plates, clean as you like, he's Virgil van Dijk, he's Virgil van Dijk.
So proud to have had this beautiful  Rolls Royce of a player at Celtic 🍀 for two and a half seasons. We were Blessed..👌🏻😁💚🍀👑🇮🇪
Prime Virgil was a machine ❤
9:33 thats its why he is the best defender, smart all time and use that in the game
The awkwardness between these two is unavoidable. 😅😅
I wanted to know who he thought was better out of Messi and ronaldo  😬😬
Love his pk decision for his life
Considering he was a dishwasher for his first job I can see why he helps keep so many clean sheets
I bet there's some Liverpool fans raging Gary Neville interviewed him.
Virg was right, when Milner scored from the penalty spot Liverpool never loose the match(Fact)😅
My nephew is 18 and his first job was a dishwasher (think it still is) due to his college education
So Virgil is a Barca fan.
😍😍😍😍
Prison Break 🔥🔥🔥🔥
James Milner always will have  a special place  to all Lfc fans ♥..  He always delivered Whenever klop bring him on the Pitch 👑👑
jesus a premier league defender and then there's fucking VVD towering over him my god
Lovely man.. All the best
Peter Pan?..come on big man lol The Rolls Royce of dishwashers...                 🔥Y.N.W.A🔥
Who he chose at the funniest player ?
Gary voice break saying party at 3:50 😂😂
prison break to the world!🔥
What he said about Sadio Mane big RESPECT best defender in the world only if he came Liverpool fc when he was at Celtic
Come on Virgil, come to JAKARTA
2:52 prison break, i love prison break
Maldives ❤ VVD is coolness personified
Fucking ads
I'm not a fan of neville but this is quite good to watch
Gary: Who's ur fav superhero?  VVD: Peter Pan~
Outstanding Human✨👍 We are lucky to have him. YNWA🍁
Wow super down to earth and smart. So much respect
Does Virgil not know Peter Pan kidnaps kids and makes them and him stay kids forever😮😂
Virgil is quite the specimen. Please have my babies!
How come they saying its too expensive to go Maldives when virg on 80grand a week he could go anytime he wants
Tate: SUSHI?!?!? 😂😂😂😂😂
Jurgen must be shouting a hell of alot lately
that was fucking boring, was he always this way or did liverpool fuck him side ways like this? i woke up when he was talking about pot washing and then went into a comatose state again
Cool as a cucumber in a freezer.
Missed asking him what else he plays, always fascinating to realize sports people are quite decent at more than one sport.
Overrated player
Shit sponsorship deal then if he can't even mention it
I remember him at celtic you could see he was going to be a world class player
Gary Neville Is too tight to go to the Maldives ffs 😂
i hate this mtherfckr...he egos...
Dishwasher machines in Liverpool should be named after him.
Gary mate fancy getting nemanja on?
You can see he’s got castle-high walls around his private, family life and more power to him.
Top bloke, top pro!
Peter Pan ? 😂😂😂😂😂
VVD is right man Milner is underrated solid player man
Imagine being, broke at 16-17 and becoming one of the best defenders in the world in a few years time.  People don't see that side of footballer's. The fact that he acknowledges the struggles of the African players is such a merit to who he is.
The reaction from Gary over the Cillian Murphy contact was priceless..😂. Cool contact.
I hate pickford for injuring him, that was not even accident
Virgil VD my favorite football player all over the world ❤. Much Love❤
I'm a Messi fun and I love Van Dijk so so much 😍🤩
Virgil 😍😍😍😍
Milner is an amazing player for sure. But it is funny how he talks about Milner like if he is 30 years older than him and in reality is only 5 or 6 years his senior.
Not a lot of people become dishwashers
Fucking Write the questions
The current Liverpool squad is simply full of people that you can't help but respect. Obviously Klopp, but also VVD, Mohamed Salah, Hendo, Milner, the list goes on and on
Having cillians murphy's number is the biggest flex
Next 👊🏾 Cristiano Yes=Like                          No=Comment                           And Asked About You
I think VVD’s only downside is that he’s too nice and humble 😭
7:39 cilian murphy
man... Virgil and his class ✨
Vvd's a class lad impossible to  dislike  coming from a united fan
Neville who im sure is a millionaire complains about the prices in the Maldives,lmaooooooooooooooooooooooo
Really nice to see Van Dijk call out Mane's story - it truly is amazing how far he's come, how humble he remains and how he continues to contribute to his roots. Both amazing players and we were blessed to have them in the same team!
get on sadio for this One!!
Gary Neville pretending he can’t afford the Maldives. Bore off. He could buy and sell virgil 10 times. Sometimes he goes to far with the acting humble
OUR NUMBER 4
Hail Hail Virgil
Nice
This is wholesome content. I take back all the hate I had for Gary Neville because it seems that the guy is a decent person all around. Also, imagine running into VVD with his hair down lol I wouldn't have a clue!
Ronald Koeman's father Martin Koeman spotted his talent when he was very young and brought him to FC Groningen. What a magnificent career he had so far.
Keep a clean sheet ??? That aged well
Virgil Van Dijk - The human dishwasher
VVD is all class.  Man among boys... (he and Erling....)
Why won’t he say his aftershave 🔴🤣
Van Dijk, respect!
When you though that you could not like Virgil even more ! Class  ❤️
Love Gary Neville
Feel so bad for Gary he looks so small next to 6”4 virg
Beautiful park they are walk-ing in … What’s the park name ?
milner needs to be another interview. hes such a world class guy
3:49 paaaaah-ty
As good as Gary Neville was it’s interesting to learn how stressed out he was all the time when playing lol..
Bro doesn’t want us commoners to smell like him 😂
Where else would you wash dishes, Gary?
One of the Legend of Afro Beat Music Davido loss his Son...Please guys say a prayer to his family 🕊🙏🇳🇬🇳🇬
Cillian Murphy 😜
As a Martian, Virgil is actually so good. We here can only envy earth for Virgil van Dijk.
more great stuff Gary
VVD. Made in Celtic💚
Gaz having a go with the number of questions even i love it hahaha 😂😂😂 🎼tweeeeeeeennnnnnttttyyyyyy times twenty times man united 🎶🎵
instead of defending, this is what he spends his time doing.
7:57 and now Ronaldo turned you down😂
Mad that he wasn't even the best centre half at Celtic when he was there.. Efe Ambrose carried him.
Neville complaining about the cost of holidays!!
We need to see a Gary Neville and Cillian Murphy interview now
Did you record this before the start of the season?
Coming here after Liverpool's lost to Leeds (2-1) yesteday hahaha Gary you should interview our rival players more often.
Props to Gary for interviewing players from mid-table teams 🙌 definitely an overlooked player from a lesser-known club 👍
Great answers, and a fantastic command of English 👍🏻
horrible interview. he didn't answer any of the questions. Wtf was the point of doing this if you are going to talk crypted anyways. cheers to gary tho
Whos here after his anfield league unbeaten run was broken
Gary's going to be the guest presenter on 'Have I Got News for You' next Friday. Should be interesting.
Only ever be one Virgil VD  we are LIVERPOOL
Seemed very guarded
Gary has nailed these. VVD seems very humble and down to earth.
You should do 0 questions with harry kane
Milner on the pen 😂😂😂says a lot about the player.Thanks big Virg enjoyed watching this.💪
The size of him!
I've followed through.
Vvd is a hero and a leader + an example to us all P.s. saw cillian Murphy on a train to Croydon once, before peaky blinders
Absolutely enjoyed that interview 👍🏻
shame on you gary you've forgotten your stone island badge
*'Virgin Van Dick'.. 🙄😅😜🤟
Mate… Cillian Murphy having VVDs number is the bigger flex - probably looks at the digits every night before bed 😂🙌🏽
The best PAaaarty
He’s our center half,he’s our number fourrrrr
Seems like a genuine bloke, these interviews help bring the proper character out.
Gary with the stoney badge taken off
Neville trying to make out the Maldives is too expensive for him?! I guess why the hypocrite is taking the Qatari money. 🤦🏾‍♂️
i hate how private he is, even about his aftershave! I wanted to know. I bet Id be able to guess it by smelling it. Itll be some Tom Ford crap.
"I can't tell you.... I can't say..." - Virgil
Once a dishwasher,now the best centre back in the world.
What a bore
People act like liverpool are bottom there 4pts of 4th with a game in hand and got like 6 players back after world cup
nice one Virgil.. unfortunately, i still hate you...xD
2:51 - he only said "Prison Break" was his favorite TV show cause he's talking to T-bag. 🤣
nice interview .. really enjoyed it
In this interview Gary and VVD confirm what I heard in interviews by the veratti and other players.. The pitch of the camp nou is large! Prolly the largest In the world. Perhaps cruyff wanted space for passes
Excellent young man! Very grounded, very down-to-earth. Wonderful player. I really like the fact that Peter Pan is his favourite super hero.
James Milner instead of Mo Salah to take the penalty for your life? 🤯
VVD LEGEND 💪🙌
“Go for a drink or get...McDonald’s” lmaoo
Respect to Mane thats nice. Well done Virg.
Gary - Do Cristiano Ronaldo before he fooks off!!
best defender in premiere league....end of
Great defender for 18 months. What a legacy.
The overlap is by far the best show around. It doesn’t matter the guest it always delivers
Virgil is so well spoken but I just wanted to add Gary saying “wow Maldives is expensive” we can well know he can go there like every weekend without it denting his wallet
knew he'd say milner!! ICE COLDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD 🥶
Form is temporary but class is permanent. Liverpool wouldn't have won anything without him.
greatest CB of his generation
Bro didnt even give his aftershave😂
Arsenal fan here, best defender in the world for the last 5 years no doubt. Top lad as well Liverpool are lucky to have him
Imagine walking into pizza hut and you just see big virg on the sinks haha
GARY NEVILLE IS a stinking hypocrite. Claims to be a socialist but has made millions from capitalism. Campaigns on human rights but will take money to work in Qatar. Criticises Qatar's human rights record but gushed over Beckham taking their millions. Campaigns for affordable housing but builds blocks of luxury flats. Moans about millionaires owning football teams but owns a football team. It goes on and on and on...
VVD's 15 questions with Gary Neville because the geezer barely answered any of them
Prison Break fan Van Dijk couldn't believe his luck when he was interviewed by Prison Break's T-Bag.
He’s long range passing is better than so many other midfielders
3:50-3:51 best moment
Humble, likeable, articulate and actually answers the questions! And not a bad footballer either. Proud to be a Liverpool fan :)
When VVD said Prison Break he really thought Gary was T-Bag.
Peter pan 😂😂😂
Gary Neville comes across as a very pleasant guy. He's a very good interviewer
Look at the size of the man
once again wondering why gary feels its his place to comment on the morality of the uk government. while taking payment from quatar to sell his own morals
you compare this guy how humble and realist he is with the overhyped clowns we have at united like trashford and captain fridge carpguire and you understand why our club is a finished commercial toilet
I don’t get why u can’t say what after shave he uses?
Big G doing a Pep and removing the Stonie badge whilst out interviewing 👍🏼
When Neville said the Maldives are expensive, Virgil just looked and thought nah not when you've got a completely unlimited amount of money
Massive respect to you Virg, for the Sadio mention. Perspective
Seems like a really decent guy, respect.
the only people thathate vvd is only united fans...they are pure jealous bcz he chose liverpool insted joining united....VVD cannot be dislikes...top player
Bringing back Mid 1990s' Absolute Art of Defence to be sexy again  💯  🌎 ..
🔥
C’est cool
Class act.
Doesn’t matter who you support, VVD is class act on and off the pitch. Would get into any team in world football. Top player and seems like a decent bloke. Unlucky not to win the Ballon Dor. Blackpool fan 🍊
I'm so proud of Virgil, he inspirated me so much... We're lucky to have you in our team, and I wish if I could know more about your family even though it's your choice and I really respect it
Finally Peter Pan getting some gas
"Virgil Van Dijk was a dishwasher".
Seems a decent bloke but still YSB
Really humble guy who is a phenomenal athlete and pro
I surprised he didn’t just start pleading the fifth jeez 😂
What's Neville doing with the enemy?? Came to see his disciple?? 😂😂😂
A true gentle giant! - From a United fan!
Couldn’t risk getting the badge in
What a bore, not telling you what aftershave I wear, not showing my hair down etc. Not a very good sport.
Peter fucking pan!
08:24 inside his head,thinking “close frickin Valverde on that left side instead of running away from him”
He treasures everything, he's a good friend too..

The Maldives is expensive to a man who earned millions playing football and now earns a million quid a year doing punditry 😂
*What a drop-off...* Not been back to his imperious best since returning from the unpunished assault by _Prickford_ at _Goodison._ Where he used to anticipate and steal the ball, hardly needing to make a tackle he now often mistimes tackles and arrives so late on the scene that he ends up dangling a lazy leg. Seems timid to physical contact. Where he previously marshalled those around him to shut out the opposition, occasionally even defending in a back-2 to great effect, he is now more apt to be caught in what look like arguments with teammates, often after conceding soft goals. Of all the _Redmen,_ his standards have dropped most. To be clear, no seniors, bar _Alisson,_ have been putting in the consistent top-drawer performances we have come to expect over the past 4-odd seasons; but _van Dijk_ has been particularly unrecognisable.  Here's hoping he can get back to 90%+ of his pre-injury _7-points-off-Messi-for-Ballon-d'Or_ form and that the rest of the senior _Redmen_ can emulate _Alisson's_ immaculate example and get our season going! *_YN🔴❤🔴WA_*
He's a great defender but certainly not the best in the world 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️
I wish Liverpool fans would stop singing IRA songs about blowing up babies
Did anyone think he was gonna say Salah for a peno taker to put his life on it
please interview max verstappen and sophia floersch
Gary I'm sure on your salary you can afford the Maldives
Seems like such a sound guy!!
Water is for fish man!!
wow - what a bloke
God. As a Man United fan you still cannot hate this man. Pure class on and off the pitch
G Neville not being able to afford a trip to the Maldives?!?!?!? Pull the other one....
Woa
respect to VVD for giving a shoutout to the Africa struggles especially football wise, Manes journey must be crazy
Milner over Salah? Ok ok lol
Top man Top player 👍
Absolutely amazing player.
This guy answered all questions correctly from a liverpool point of view ✅
Great player but about as much personality as a plank of wood. Not a patch on Rice, Fury etc
Liverpool fan here but love gary for his great interviews qns and vibes. Hate him tho when hes in man utd shirt. 😂
Was an honour to watch him week in week out when he was at Celtic. Never forget those legendary 70 yard diagonal pings at Celtic park.
Imaging some of us was so happy when he was injury💔🥺🥺🥺🤌🏻
This man is so humble 😢
So he’ll play for Barcelona one day I think, that would be nuts tho
What's Virgils aftershave you think? put it down below:
Body Warmer
Was waiting for the T bag joke
Ffs should've been longer😭🤦🏾‍♂️
Gary Neville can take some of the Qatari money and then take the vacation to Maldives
Man said Peter Pan 😅
they should change the title of this show to 'begging it'
make the call barca!!
3:50 the voice crack!
Afrobeat getting the shoutout ❤
What is the best pAaaarty you have ever been to?
Van Delegate.
Won't tell Gary what aftershave he wears. Won't put his hair down. Wont tell him where he stays in the Maldives. Boring man
“You’d put your life in the hands of James Milner?”
Hype
Someone is a clearly a Barca fan , hope to see him there
Why you interviewing Van dixk
Even tho I'm a United fan I have a lot of respect for VVD he’s a great player n has been the best CB in the world for the last 4 years🤷🏾‍♂🤷🏾‍♂being a United fan means I can’t help but be happy to see him fail that’s juss how it is but I still rate him very highly as a player n he’s such a humble guy as well so as a person I can’t hate on him at all✅✅as a CB as well I base my game off players like him in terms of his ball playing ability n composure but like Carra the one thing he does lack is aggression in his defending 🤧🤧the goal they conceded vs Forest was literally a carbon copy of the goal in the UCL final Madrid scored when instead of dealing with the cross properly he swings his leg back to try n look effortless ffs🤦🏾‍♂🤦🏾‍♂
Cillian Murphy wasn't lying he really doesn't do the whole selfie/fan photo thing 😂 He even sits alone at his local pub back in Cork. It's a good thing.
Currently the most over rated CB in the premier league 🐸☕️
What a lovely down to earth fella Virgil is!
I love these overlap series, i'm a huge Liverpool fan and love Vvd, he's such a humble guy and brilliant cb. But i also love Gary, he's the type of guy you'd go down to the pub for a few pints, very straight and funny guy and always speaks the truth even if its against Utd, he'll stick his neck out. Would love him to do Robbo soon, that'll be fun.
🐐
Peter fucking psn
Most overrated player the league's seen
best defender itw rn
Virgil having Cillian Murphy's number whislt saying his favorite TV Series is Prison Break🤣🤣
"Afrobeats" Gary is wildy out of his depth here culturally. It's glorious to see.
Gary Neville es una porqueria de jugador. Gary Neville is a trash player
One of the greatest defenders we've ever had.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Sounds like he may end his career at Barcelona 👂
Virgil>>>haaland 🔒
He cant say which aftershave, probably because LFC are sponsored by Nivea?
My respect to Virg became high when he mentioned Sadio's success story 🥰
What a gentleman. Proper captain, role model material
This guy is to up his ass he got fortunes and he can’t answer simple questions fuck him
post on spotify coward
What a humble man.
He is so humble and grounded. Legend
Never realised Frank Bruno played for Liverpool
VVD must of been told to day prison break is he's favourite TV show 😂
Only here for Virgil
Great video loved it! I remember my high school teammates/classmates in school saying I’m like Virgil Van Dijk when I was playing football in PE physical education because I defended really well and made a good tackle.
Carried by Alisson
Loved the Peter Pan answer!
“I was a dishwasher” “What? At a restaurant”  Nay Gary at the morgue lad
unlike guests before him comes across as a complete conditioned robot.
Best PAaaaaaaarty
Prison break is my favourite too.
As soon as van dijk mentioned prison break Neville quickly moved onto the next question, hahahaha! #TBAG
Prison break🤣😭
Virgil Van Dijk is like 10x more famous than Cillian murphy lol
Neville is a brilliant host
VVD is a heck of player and a person as well
Why didn’t you ask him why he does oasis impressions when he’s defending
Where abouts is this fimed?
Peter pan
"Why you use your butt instead of your feet to defend” ? 😀
Respect for Virgil!
Can’t say what aftershave he wears 😂 Jesus Christ it must be top secret
What an absolute giga chad of a man.
Should have come city. Would have won more leagues and ultimately got more recognition than he does.
Neville's laugh, sooo annoying!
James Milner! Not harry Kane or Ronaldo? Wont say the name of his aftershave?
I like him always did but a bit less after watching this video 😂 as a madrid fan I dont like that hes on the barca side.
I really love his humbleness and great personality 💕
Glad you loved your holidays at The Maldives Virgil 🇲🇻🇲🇻🇲🇻
Just don’t mention the Forest defeat 😅
I'm pretty sure Cillian is a Celtic and Liverpool fan, so I'm not surprised he didn't want to take a photo. 😆
What is the best ever pArTyYyY you've been to
Peter Pan?!?!?! FFS 🤦🏽‍♂️
Not naming a aftershave is just stupid. How can that be a secret?
This, in all honesty was not a great. I respect VVD as a player but he's a bland as toast.
He's our centre half he's our number 4! YNWA
Brilliant interview
Gary Neville: your content is superb and your interviewing skills are great. I would pay for this in a bundle with two other top interviewers -the bundle is important to create competition and make sure you get paid properly
Good interview Gary. Well played.
Never understood the Dutch<>Barcelona obsession but his explanation makes sense
G Nev looks tiny 😅
VVD Is an absolute weapon!!!  Legend 👏
Classic Neville noise 4:21
Sounds like more of a Barca fan than Liverpool. Am sure Laporte is getting a bid ready after hearing about this love affair with Barca
Gnev can use his qatar blood money for a trip to the maldives
Jesus christ he's dry
Love these segments Gary, they’re really excellent. Couple of suggestions with all due respect. Put your phone down out of view after you ask a question! and stop trying to suggest answers after asking a question! Let them talk, you’re the interviewer.
3:51 Gary with the voice crack😂
I am a Man Utd fan but would love to have Sadio Mane on Overlap...
I don't think anyone has ever answered "peter pan" when asked who their favorite superhero is 🤣
the way he talks bout Millie😭😭😭
I thought Hendo always listen to alicia keys
why this clown
Gary Neville complaining somewhere is expensive. How much money is enough for him? And he keeps pushing gambling, hypocritical
Vvd is black? He listens to Afro beats
The only Liverpool player i respect besides Sadio.. Rest of them are crying Twats...
Of course Robbo being the funniest!
Smiling when he says Prison Break because T Bag is interviewing him
He's the best number 4 in the League 🐐
How can a multi millionaire like Garry Neville complain about the cost of a holiday to the Maldives.
The lad conveniently avoids messi vs ronaldo to all of messi camp and asks ronaldo camp without fail!
as a hockey, basketball, american, football, volleyball fan, this was a good interview blah blah blah
yea! 'i can't disclose this' dijk !! great !! such a joy to watch
🎶When you walk through a storm, hold your head up high...🎶
Whereabouts are they walking? Looks beautiful?
Greatest virgil
K by Dolce & Gabbana x Virgil van Dijk
Gary neville cares more about money than people dying/ being murdered/ being imprisoned in certain parts of the middle east. the man is a hypocrite.
Van Disney
What an immediately likeable guy
Bro said Peter Pan as a superhero
Top class content with a top class defender. & Gary Neville 😝
not a single question about liverpool’s current form? Huh? wtf is this?
Should get Mané on the overlap tbh
The 🐐 with the one who thinks he fit the description 😂
Maldives is a fortune come on Gary not like you cannot afford it get yourself there… also hate to say it as a united fan but this man is the best defender in the country
Love all the positive comments
James muthaF Milner 🙌🏽
Gary's reaction when Virgil said he had Cilian Murphy's number.
This guy is a solid lad.
Virgil ‘I can’t say’ Van Dijk
Gary blah blah blah Roy stuck it on him the other day
Prison Break, Virgil has great taste
Im a pool fan absolutely hate gary but hes a good pundit/interviewer 😂
Him picking Peter Pan as his favorite hero is incredible
3:50 gary ayo that voice crack
oooo so mysterious!
Fucking specimen. I’m not gay but..
End of the days use players get pay way to much for playing two-three games a week
3:50 is it just me or did Gary's voice just break after they deliberately showed that scene?  lol
This man is pure respect and humble  And hopefully he lifts the world cup with the Netherlands
Liverpool fan, VVD is an absolute Rolls Royce of a player.  Him and Jaap Stam would be the perfect centre back pairing.
Van Disney is finished
Would love to see a rashford overlap
Boring guy .. Christ
Favorite tv show: Prison Break and he is walking next to T-Bag!!!! lol
I’m no Liverpool fan but anyone who says he’s not one of the best European CB’s in the past 20 years is lying
Seen many of these and liked most but VVD seems bit of a boring bloke to me. Lacks charisma.....not gonna tell us his fave aftershave, weird. Ok maybe he's got a sponsorship deal, give him that one but on another question again, didn't want to give much away. Lighten up pal! Great defender but seems that's about it.
Vidic says Hi 👋 🇷🇸
When he joined Liverpool he had an aura that gave the other players so much confidence
When he mentioned mane I started to tear up. Why did he have to leave
We need a James Milner over lap.
BIG VIRJ
This guy has cillian Murphy number but he wishes he had Gnevs number of prems
lost cause 😐
He’s out of form this season, but been a monster for 5 seasons at Liverpool, absolutely changed that team.
3.51 what happened there Gary 😂😂
Virg, I am disappointed in the outfit.
Is that the ralla 😆
Millionaire complains about price of a holiday. Give me a break 🤦🏾‍♂️
One of the best CBs the league has ever seen....2018-2020💯GOAT levels
Great interview as always from GNev, however, i find it a bit distasteful to joke about how expensive maldives got recently, coming from multi million pound football people, especially in these dire economic times when millions of families struggle to make ends meet. Bit of empathy for average people please :)
Thats a lie they lost covid time
Love Gary he wears different hats and is good at all of them 😎😍
Where are you beautiful looking place,Virgil handsome man, Gary is good at what he does starry🤩 eyed with big virg
"what is the best pAaRrTTII"
Why can’t he just say what aftershave he uses
Should have asked what Liverpool player from past he would have liked to have played with, Gerrard or Carragher? 😂
He is all class. Our number 4!
Football fans have wanted content like this for years. Seeing players, whether it be from your team or another, talk about their life, is interesting.  Keep it up. X
It’s nice to see the real person and not just the footballer. Seems a very humble and respectable man
We just gonna pretend he didnt say Peter Pan was his favorite superhero?
He’s awesome 😊
You saw that hurt nev when he heard about cilians number 🤣🤣
cause youre smol
As a...   Just state, I am...
Peter Pan being a superhero sums up Liverpool 🤣
If you wanna have a very strange conversation with someone, speak to any Dutch person.  They are INCREDIBLE at making ANY conversation weird and awkward.   BUT: this guy is an absolute baller. Utd fans that try and undermine what this guy does are just making themselves look foolish. I love Utd, but not too proud to admit that this guy is one of the best the Prem has ever seen at CB. As long as he doesn’t do one to Spain any time soon, he may well go down as the best ever. Would have to win a couple more league titles tho as well.
If only him and Skrtel played together.
Hes such a great example to the younger players. Great leader and role model. Keeps himself very grounded. And he's a peaky blinders fan 😎
Van Dijk is a brilliant Footballer ❤
Football aside the big man is just pure ground control, grounded to the core, one cool fella indeed... Ten hut big Virg  YNWA
Lies he hasn’t got his number
3:50 wtfffff 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Big Virg! 💪🏽
Difference between twitter users and YouTube users. Twitter is full of toxic users
My man come from celtic to one of best defenders in world. Deserves respect everyday of the week
Could tell he was a nice guy. Love that Prison Break is his favourtie show. Top man. Gary is a natural at this now.
Barcelona could have signed him, instead they went for Coutinho and funded him for Liverpool
Reading these comments from other fans.. I really need to get off twitter, night and day the way fans interact !
He is absolute class. From a United fan. Too bad he will never admit he is United fan now as a Liverpool legend
Guess im never going to the Maldives if an ex footballer and property developer said its too expensive 😂
Worse one yet! Did he actually share anything there?
As a United Supporter I HATE the fact that I have always liked this guy ...
Barcelona be like 🤔🤔we might have a chance with him😂😂😂
“What is the best *PaRtY* you’ve been to”
I absolutely love The Overlap
The overlap is brilliant. No silly pundit opinions no silly tv presenters sensationalism , no ex average players thinking that their opinions are greater than yours or mine . Just a fun escapist from the bs nonsense footy show .
So the main message is "keep a clean sheet"? Well I don't think that message has been getting through.
Maybe VVD and every other LFC player should concentrate on practising how to defend instead of spending time with this small clown.
3:49 unexpected Gary neville voice break
3:50 “What is the best paAAArty you’ve ever been to?”
I’m a utd fan but no defender is better than VVD although I think a fit varaneis pretty close but Virgil was a master buy by klopp
love how Gary Is looking up the whole time looool
Best cb in fifa 23 by a country mile lol
I'm a Man United & Van Dijk is a world class CB although he's struggling this season but he's been top drawer for Liverpool ever since he joined them. I think he's Liverpool's most important player. Take him out then their defence is very weak
VVD is the Goat of Central defenders.. ramos is also great but he has had just more successful career
Hope Barca don't start sniffing around for him, seems like he would like to play for them one day 😬
What a man...
He got only 4 years left then be retering
Prison Break was definitely a dig at Gary looking like T-bag!!
That's the second shout for Mr Reliable James Milner.
Van D is a Barcelona fan this made my day
Admit it you came here for Gary Neville
G-Nev looks like a midget 😄
Neville saying it’s expensive as if he ain’t swimming in money
3:50 Nevs voice crack done him in there
Where was this filmed?
19 questions and not one mention of the saints the club that gave him his start in the premier league that’s a shame really
Look how tiny Gary looks infront of this collosal
Y N W A
Peter pan is a legendary answer
Gary do it with Ronaldo
You two got a post office job after this? Both dressed in all black. Lol
Best CB in the world.
The interview I was waiting for. I wish he had scored that header in Liverpool vs Nothingham
Boring
Great player boring as hell
The guy things he’s that special he can’t say what aftershave he wears or what part of the Maldives he stays in? What a tit.
He seems like such a great guy.
Who is the funniest ? Andy robertson scottish 😂😂😂😂
Get ya cloggs n tulips you van dijk fanboys
Peter Pan as the superhero though :')
I bet if Gaz pressed VVD whom is his favourite character from Prison Break- surely VVD says its T-bag i be dying if so and that would probably elevate VVD to ultimate Goat defender ever lol
I'm suprised he didn't do a 2 hour TEDtalk on why he loves Joel Matip 😂
I'm Man Utd but he is a likeable guy
Can remember grealish playing with him when we won 7-2
VVD acting like he has to work hard the whole year to go to the Maldives🤣🤣 He’d earn enough in his sleep to afford to go haha
Top class athletisism, great header of the ball and excellent positional sense. VVD, now that's a different matter. :@)
Virgil what a guy❤❤
VVD says he was a dishwasher and Nev asks….in a restaurant?….no Gary, in Dixons! 😂
This is really good, his face when he speaks about being a dishwasher almost feels like you can see him reflect on how far he's come...  (still a shame Gary took the WC blood money from the murdering autocrats though)
We need to know what aftershave he wears!!!  Top lad Virgil. Calm, humble and an absolute unit!  #YNWA
Gary "where did you get your trainers from?" .. 👀🤣
Top class lad. Be a lil sharper again and don’t mind running a bit again and he‘ll be back at his best game.
Beautiful place
Yes now bring Vidic on
Gary: “Tell me something people don’t know about you” Virgil proceeds to tell a story as dull, unoriginal and predictable as Jurgen Klopps team selection
If I was a Liverpool fan I'd be worried if Barcelona seen this they'll be signing him next season. Obviously he's a huge fan of Barcelona.
I would have to take that penalty myself but what do i know 🤷🤦
Great to get T-Bag to interview him since his favourite show is Prison Break
Man fully twerking for Barca out here
Their destination is endless 💀
Can’t name his aftershave. 😴🥱
I honestly love Virgil Van Dijk, he’s such a humble person and has great character. Even on the field his elegance and presence is unmatched. The best Centre Back in the world ❤️
Can i have the shoes they walking on if maybe they  discard them??
The most over rated player to of ever played in the prem. And he is the personality of a cancerous tumour
Sounds like he wants to retire at Barca 😂
Where do you stay in the Maldives? - Can’t say  What after shave do you wear? Can’t say  Take your hair down for us? No.  What a great interview!  He’s as dull as I thought he’d be
Favourite superhero - Peter Pan 😂😂😂
If Gary Neville is priced out of going to the Maldives, what hope do the rest of us have? 😆
Used to hate him but he comes across as a nice humble guy on top of being one of the best Cb of his generation so he deserves to be respected by every football fan
Im a liverpool fan, but how he said about the holiday he said '' that's why we work so hard in the year to be able to afford this '' His week wage could but an island in the Maldives :D  Best centre back !!
Fantastic player…. Worth getting fined for “tapping “ him up ….
Fucking van dijk has been shit all season thats why Neville is happy to chat with him
James Milner! 🤣
Cillian Murphy is obviously a scouser!
What a nice guy
As a United fan. Virgil is a top cb.
Every footballer seems to have a thing for Prison Break
Vvd is one of the most intelligent defenders to grace the football pitch.
Top Man ...big respect! 😎🤘🎸
Peter Pan!!!! hahahah
3:49 gary we’re not letting u forget this moment
prison break being his fav show really makes sense as to how cool he acts, he acts just like michael
As a utd fan I wanna hate him so badly , but he seems like a lovely fella
Clearly wants a move to Barcelona
Good to see martyn Tyler / Alex Scott / ally Mcoist / Rio Ferdinand / Gary linekar /
As an Attack Helicopter, Van Dijk is a good defender.
No defender runs back in a straight line towards their own goal like Virgil.
Don't suprise if he signs for Barcelona in 2024 or 25.👀
The Overlap is great because the world needs more Gary Neville.
think this type of thing is the reason vvd is one of the best ever in his position - you can tell he's an unreal guy and a great dude to have in the changing room. Just wish he was at arsenal instead haha
3:50 paaaaauuurty
I'm sure Gary could afford the Maldives 🤣
Milner would be a good guest to have on this
Rolls Royce 🐐
As a Celtic fan its really cool seeing how Virgils career has flourished.
What a guy 🍀 was a pleasure watching him at Celtic 💚
Worst overlap iv seen. Boring man
Prison Break.... Whilst being interviewed by T-bag
Spurs fan here. VVD is a phenomenal player, his work rate over the years has been astonishing & he's still humble.
Celtic hero 🇳🇱🍀🔥
Van this year you're not working hard
No personality at all.
Boring bastard
Gary Neville turns scouse…. 3:48 “what is the best Paaaaaarty”
crazy he fell through the cracks until he was 18
Oh careful Gary is interviewing Van Dijk might be a transfer bid incoming 😅
One of the greatest centre backs of our generation
It's clear he'd have rather played for Barcelona than Liverpool
Cillian 🐐
Virgil has zero regrets in his life? Not even cheating on his pregnant wife with a porn star? Pathetic statement.
Maybe he doesn’t always defend good but just having him in the team really scares the strikers at least a little bit so his presence alone is very much a help to Liverpool.
Dishwasher to dish winner . VvD is imo in the top 5 CB’s I’ve ever seen! Sensational
Van Dijk clearly a Barcelona fan 👍
Any regrets? Should of said not scoring a hat trick at forest. But we forgive you big man. Class act
PETER PAN
Shock it’s a Liverpool player / the Liverpool and united wankfest train just never stops.
Too busy trying to look like he ain’t trying that he lets in goals.. could never be my CB
What an absolute unit seeing him tower above Garry Neville. Neville must have been built different to defend the box against people VVD's size back in the day.
Our Virg ❤ we love and adore him so much at LFC. The most humble guy, unbelievable professional with the talent to go with it. Transformed my team entirely & I hope we have him for many more years to come. Can’t wait for the full episode
Can't name his aftershave..some footballers really have lost touch with reality 🤣
Guy is a beast, made Gary look about 4ft in that interview.
i hate Liverpool but Virgil seems like a genuine guy and the fact that he likes Afrobeats makes me respect him
Garry won’t have to complain about the price of the Maldives after his multi million deal with Qatar TV 😂😂😂
I guess you weren't paid for this one Gary. Can't believe you got into the politics of the world Cup and where super lenient about all that. Had a shit load of respect for you until that happened. Times change, eh!
James Milner, my friends, is THE GOAT! BITE ME
Fuck love this guy humble af
One of the best CB to ever play in the Prem...without a doubt makes the top 5 (could end up making the top3 by the end of his career)
City fan here he’s made our job a lot harder winning titles one of my favourite CBs
T-Bag!
Gary Neville can't afford the Maldives !?! Aye - right ! 🤣🤣
YSB,
This guy is one of the best defenders in the world and one of the greatest in the PL. Those haters put some respect on his name!
Manu fan here but this guy is up there with the best in the league ever!we all envious of liverpool havin him to be honest..
As a Liverpool fan, i am alwayd in awe of VVD. My selfish self wants to keep him a red forever. But a part of me wants to see him in another shirt. Like Barca.
That Cillian Murphy's phone number in Virgil's phone has really wrangled Gary. I Bet Roy Keane will be pissing himself seeing Gary saying again... That Murphy blanked him clean on set.
When he said Prison Break it seemed like he expected a reaction from Gary because of Teabag. lol
Virgil those Nike Air Jordans are Going to be ruined after that walk mate.  What a Defender.  Keep doing what your doing. More good things will happen. And keep the lads close knit like a family. Get them to stop listening to any negative noise on social media etc. Keep the lads positive..keep them lean. And maintain that family core vibe within the club.  All the best big man.
I don't care who you support...you have to put respect on this guys name
Warra guy, Liverpool legend.
peter pan was a nonce or am I wrong?
Neville is smashing it
Inspirational story
Typical neville tight arse to dear
The voice break at 3:51 😂
Honorable mention of Afrobeats....been a long way to this recognition across the globe now!
I always pick people like Milner to take penalties, but professionals and most other people do otherwise. What do I mean, people like Milner? I mean, any player who picks a spot and smashes it, and those players are usually defenders or defensive midfielders like Milner, who does exactly that. Strikers, and other attacking players nearly always try to pass the ball into the net, and/or do daft run ups where they get no power on the ball. I set up a Sunday league team with my mate around 10 years ago, and every time we had a penalty shoot-out during training (which wasn't that often), me (an unfit right-footed left back, who used to be able to run all day long), and my nephew's best mate (who was a relatively short, but calm and skilful defensive midfielder) were always the best at taking penalties. Yet still, we had to let the strikers take penalties in actual matches, which makes no sense to me, as we had proven countless times that we as defensive players were better at taking penalties.
was this before or after he missed the header vs forest
man said prison break cause gary's t bag
ofc as a LFC is great seeing our players answer our questions but it's pretty cool hearing from any player from any team hearing their life stories, likes and dislikes. I think we forget even though they are very fortunate they are just normal like us.
Absolutely love this man, Liverpool's success would be nothing without him and Alisson 🔥
I’m a man Utd fan but I love Virgil. The man is class, most players these days want attention but he wants his privacy. And he’s a big fan of Cillian Murphy whom I love too.
Virgil having Cillian Murphy's number whilst Gary can't even get a photo with him 😂
Love VVD. This was a great interview.   Can’t imagine him as a dishwasher, but it makes sense, with how humble and sensible he comes across.   Cannot imagine LFC without this great stature of a man. Will go down as a legend.   YNWA❤
Not again 4:21
Ramos is clear of him lol
What is it with footballers loving Prison Break? 😂
Life is mad! Gary is gushing over Virgil having Cillian Murphy’s number but he’s got David Beckham number on speed dial 😂😂😂
Prison Break? Is that even still on?
Basicaly he played as good as JT but only for 3 seasons not a career
Bloody hell Virg, it’s only aftershave! 😂
These foreign players' english is immaculate
Ex Groningen
Curse of the overlap interview. 2nd pl centre back to do a major flop after this interview
3:50... don't worry Garry mate happens to us all, normally when we're about 14 though! lol
Where was this ? Beautiful place!
He’s our centre half, he’s our number 4! VVD
Can’t even imagine where we’d be without him, what an insanely good player
I love that he thinks Cilian Murphy is the most famous number in his phone, he is good friends with a worldwide star like Salah
Won’t say his after shave says it all about a footballer. Show me the money!
Imagine saying your favourite tv show is prison break in front of T-Bag😂
First question. how come you went from best cb of all time to a mid table average joe
Get james milner on.
People mocking him. Think about how he changed Liverpool.  Liverpool we used to laugh at. Damn it, I missed Liverpool back then.
They done Gary dirty keeping that voice break in 😂😂😂
So VVD is a barca fan..it's a shame barca never gone for him once even though they were in need of a proper CB for years...
Great human being and a great footballer
One of the best defenders the premier league has ever seen at minimum
What a guy! GOAT defender too
Virg wrong shoes for that walk mate 🙈
I love this man to death
United fan here. Man is a legend of the Premier League.
Peter pan lol. Cmon virgil mate lol
This sounds like van djik screaming "barca, come pick me"
Vvd! Absolute legend 💪
As a Man Utd fan, I only like 2 Liverpool players - Virgil Van Dijk and Sadio Mane(when he used to play)
Great defender, the best in the world over the past few seasons Not in the greatest form, but form is temporary and class is permanent
You’ve got to love Gary Neville 😂
Virgil only makes headlines on the pitch. a true professional and a very humble man
Top bloke
The Sun:  Virgil Issues Come Get Me Plea To Barcelona Shock
Most talented player I've ever seen in the flesh at St. Mary's, was obvious even whilst he was with us he'd become the best defender in the world. Great player.
virgil knows that James's the GOAT
Swear everybody and there mom was rdy to right off VVD until he showed class is perminant and bad form is temporary, he held halaand in check like he was his daddy. The last headed clearance and the head check before to see where halaand was is what makes a world class defender sniff danger early. He walks into everyteam in the world and if it weren't for that shock injury last year he would've never lost form and had all these critics. To think he walked off on his on accord off the field with a turn ACL shows u the Goliath this man is. Totally changed Liverpool with Allison.
He wishes he was half the man Phil Jones is…
20th question: how do you defend with your aura?
Why Gary being modest and saying how expensive a holiday is 😂😂
The Liverpool PR has begun
100% joining Barca next 😂
He's a shadow of his former self on the pitch. He reminded us what he was vs city
Gary is at it again, the curse continues
What a player what a man seems very nice and respectful
VVD is the player that elevated Liverpool from title pretenders to genuine contenders! His first full season with Liverpool is the best individual display I've seen from any defender!
Surprised he didn't injure himself walking.
Has Cillian Murphy's number 😂😂😂 the Liverpool connection
Just whew you think Big Virgil can't get any better....did a dish washing job...grounded, top, top fella - Rolls Royce YNWA.
Not just one of my favourite defenders ever but one of my favourite sports personalities! He’s just a likeable bloke!
My respect for him increased when he chose Milner. That guy is a heck of a player, doesn't get nearly enough credit.
What a genuinely nice bloke. Brilliant player as well.
Brilliant player
Can't answer this, can't answer that. Fucking hell.
I'm sure they all say 'Prison Break' now to get a reaction off Gary
Peter Pan 🤣 is he a superhero ?
Brilliant Overlap. Virgil is the only Liverpool player that I would have anywhere near Old Trafford. I loved his mention of Sadio Mane.What that guy has gone through and what he is doing for his country is just phenomenal. Gary, get Sadio on please!!
Peter Pan? Bye
Gobshite
3:50 lol that Neville voice crack on “parrrrrty”
Lol, Garry moaning about holiday costs! God help the working person then!
Pocketed by taiwo
Van Dijk was the best CB in the world for a few years, i don’t know if he still is, but i think he has a chance at one last season as the best
loved Peter Pan as well. 💯
Gary helping VVD get out of the FOREST he got lost in at the weekend.
Wheres this being filmed? Hale ?
someones gonna be at barca in two years...
What a humble guy. The last 4/5 yrs having him has been magical. I hope we can turn our season around or pick a trophy up.
Seems a salt of the earth bloke. Big respect.  Steering a fan away from him as he was leaning into the Liverpool bus at OT in 2019. As I pushed the fan away I stepped back and bumped into him. (He is colossal up close). Thanked me and carried on talking to the physio.
Where’s this filmed? Looks great for a dog walk.
Another decent interview incoming. This should be a good insight into VVD. Always speaks and conducts himself well and the relaxed style Gary has when doing these interviews, like I said should be a good watch.
After this I can see Virgil playing for Barca next season.
This man gets so much smoke blown up his ass he believes it all. A total bluffer
What a calm & relaxed individual. I bet his heart rate barely goes above 12. Atb.
Trevor chalobah >>>>>
My hair is loose ffs that says it all about vvd
Much respect to Vvd. Not a fan of Liverpool but he’s world class!
humble virg off to the maldives
Great interview 👌🏻
I'm a liverpool fan and i have to admit, gary really nailed it. Hope he's going to do this forever.
Mourinho has blood on his hands for signing lindelof over vvd that summer
As a manchester united fan I absolutely love Virgil
Be no harm if u shouted during the game and got stuck in u overrated primadonna
Sözler köşkündeki dallamaya benziyo
We want Cristiano.
DINHO🪄
A weeks worth of hard work is enough for him, not the whole year lol
These were exceptionally dull questions. favorite stadium? Best party? Who comes up with this garbage.
What’s the best “paarrhty” you’ve been too ?
The fact he never said his fragrance actually annoyed me 😂😂😂
I’m a Chelsea fan and all I can say is this guy has been incredible for the last few years and should of won the Ballon Dor that year he was robbed
6:40 - lol. I like to keep my life private.   Comes on one of internet's biggest channels to do interview. Lol.
I love the admiration VVD gets from rival fans. As a Liverpool fan, I can say I enjoy Gary as much as you do VVD. Gary is such a pleasant and genuine guy, such a joy to watch him host these!
Man united fan here . Virgil is a monster of a player and a good human being!
Please go to Barcelona next unless you retire in Liverpool
Best CB the premier league has ever seen!
"i was a dishwasher"
Some really odd noises from Garry 😂😂
Some really odd noises from Garry 😂😂
Gary Neville claims to be 5'11? Hahahahahahahha
Bad timing Gary 😂
Love that story of Cillian Murphy pieing off G-Nev
Van Dijk What A Lovely Stuff.....✊🏿🤍
Harry Mcguire  fan here fuk VVD
Arsenal fan here, really respect how good VVD is 💪
3:50 lovely voice crack from Neville
Peter Pan Dijk
Gone very poor this season Beginning of the end maybe ?
Favourite superhero is Peter Pan? Check his hard drive! GGMU
"I love water" first time I am hearing someone say this 😅
i want to see his hair
He’s such a Barcelona player!!!
Cillian Murphy supports Liverpool, so no wonder he didn't want a pic with Gary.
There you go, keep arguing with fellow Liverpool fans...that players and managers will always say the CL as the main one, the idiots think the league is more special to players and managers. Don't get me wrong before our title win, for over 30 years i've wanted the league title, memories were sketchy as my family celebrated in 1989....but i can say that european cup is everything, the nerves the tension and euphoria that success can bring out of you, nothing else compares ...well italy winning the world cup 2006!
NEXT  jamie carragher interview with martinez. I will pay to see that
As United fan it’s annoying that he joined Liverpool cause he has been unreal and always seems like a humble and stand up guy, definitely the kind of person you would want on your team.
Can you do one with erling haaland
I have no idea who Kilean Murphy is or Peaker Blinders but what I do know is that Ive supported Liverpool for 33 years and the legend that is Big Virg is one of my all time favourite players on and off the pitch YNWA!
Can't wait for the full interview!
Christ, might be the most boring guest Gary's ever had
The best center back in the recent years. Just a reminder he gave a tough competition to Mess for Ballon D'Or and lost by a few votes. His 18/19 season is the best individual season in Premier League history.
Laporta watching this is rubbing his hands
Should have asked him to teach you the jockey
This is surprising 🍿
3:50 the voice crack😂😂😂
In my eyes he.s still a great player
2 people. One a great defender, the other Gary Neville.
He love African music wow
Van Disney is a great player with amazing qualities apart from him standing still & not diving for tackles.
VVD genuinely loves Liverpool   Gotta admire that
VVD is quality and one of the best defenders in the world at the moment.  But he doesn't come anywhere near the best ever in the Premier League (let alone Europe) Terry, Rio, Adams, Kompany and Vidic all played for longer at the highest level and not just 4 or 5 good years like VVD.  Also, the quality of central defenders has dropped massively in the last 10 - 15 years. So I doubt VVD would have stood out amongst the above list, plus Maldini, Nesta, Cannavaro, prime Ramos, Puyol etc.
Sushi ? Maledives ?....Sounds Like His Wife is talking
what a legend
The only defender that rattles Haaland. Just let that sink in…
6:15 😂😂😂
He doesn't ask messi or ronaldo anymore he knows the answer keeps bring in these joker penalty questions to keep penaldo relevant 😜😜😜unfortunately for him people know what he is doing 😜😜😜😜
So many modern players are more concerned about being disrespected than winning. Van dyk is a typical modern player.
3:50 that voice break 😂
Best CB of the past 5 years.
Seems like he has a dream to play for Barca
Find the ones with current players are quite boring, I think could be something to do with not affecting ther careers. Don’t say this can’t say that
3:52 great voice break
VVD is too private he needs to relax a little
In or out of form. Dude is a legend.
BIG VIRG 🤩 MY MAN 👊
❤️
Oh look it’s haaland’s son🥹
wow i was imagining van dijk at barcelona in the back 4 with balde, araujo, and kounde !!! Damn!!!
Might be a good defender but he is an awful guy I saw him in Abu Dhabi a right arrogate and he is so rude. Not a great role mode, believe me awful awful ! Not like Kante.
Maldives is expensive but give over at Neville saying it’s pricey. Man has more money than 99.9% of people & Virgil can afford a holiday there comfortably after working 2 days
T bag skipped past the Prison Break answer quick....
makes Gary look about 5 foot tall 😂
Can't imagine Liverpool without him.
So glad he got VVD on here. It's nice to know the Overlap curse has headed to Liverpool 🤣
Someone needs to tell Virgil about traction alopecia.. It's clearly affecting his hairline
Late bloomer like Van Nistelrooy
No Jamie carragher tho
He seems like a barrel of laughs…
The fact people talk him down so fast after some sloppy time (which already seemed to come to an end) just shows how consistent and great he has been those years before that horrible injury. But class is permanent and it looks like Virgil is on the right track back. But even in his form dip he is still probably among the best defenders out there at the moment.
I prefer not to watch Starmers virtue signalling boyfriend.....
one of the best players the leagues ever seen
0:36... Pretending he's working class !   He own's half of Manchester...
Was not expecting to hear Peter pan is his favourite superhero
AHHH i hate that this guy is so humble - as a MUFC fan it makes it hard for me to hate him as a player
Gatekeeper Virg
This guy is big , or is Neville small?
Great stuff
my man wants to go to barcelona
I remember meeting van dijk outside anfield in 2021 and his breath just stunk of poo
VVD is impossible to dislike. As rival fans were all jealous Liverpool have him.   He really seems like the most down to earth, humble, polite guy without even mentioning his world class ability on the pitch
Michael Cartmill said you were a fraud Virgil
How boring and safe is he 😵😕😕
Dude is still one of the best itw during his worst form he’s had at Liverpool. People are jus disrespecting cause they’re jealous lol
Virg with the Nike Panda Dunks 🐼
When Gary said “ party “ it sounded so weird 😂
I never thought Liverpool would have another player as influential as Gerrard. 8s, 9s, 10s every week. the club owe it to him to rebuild their midfield unit because when the team structure works he is flawless.
I always wonder if he knew when he was at celtic that he was so much better than Scottish prem levels, or that he'd mature into a player that was so much better than that level
Man Utd fan, but VVD is top drawer, absolute rolls royce of a defender
His first job was a dishwasher...Guy was always a machine
Ronaldinho might not have had the longevity but pretty much every player of this age group says he was their favourite
You need to change the question to "what's your favourite fictional character"
1. How many times have you had your car nicked?  2. Can you actually understand them high pitched whiny voices?  3. Are you sick of hearin about the Beatles yet?  4. Is it true that Firmino has never scored a goal?  5. Are you sick of hearing about the Beatles yet?  6. Have you really all got asthma though?  7. What actually is in those inhalers?  8. Don’t you reckon Gerard falling over was just the funniest shit ever?  9. When people call you a goat is it just cos you look like one?  10. Don’t you reckon 1 league title is a bit shit for “the greatest team ever”?  11. Darwin Nunez is starting to look like a proper shit buy isn’t he?  12. Is your Mrs Scouse?  13. Did she come with teeth?  14. Did she wear a white tracksuit to your wedding?  15. Are you sick of hearing about the Beatles yet?  16. Is klopp actually a nonce or does he just look like one?  17. How much do you miss Mane and his big Robocop lookin fod?  18. Did you know that scousers are just Manchester’s heroin addicts who fell in the Mersey and floated away?  19. Are you gonna be gutted when you finish 11th?
Ask him about forest
Yes Virgil. Prison Break is the greatest TV show of all time
Virgil jammin' to Fela Kuti. Brilliant.
our centre half, our number 4
Prison break is a piece of shit show. So many players say that prison break is their favorite show. It goes to show how unintelligent players are
James Milner?? Honestly man
I still can't believe Ajax/PSV/Feyenoord all passed on Van Dijk when he was at Groningen.
Neville trying to speak like one of us.
I’m sorry Peter Pan is not a super hero 🤣🤣🤣
As a fan of avocados VVD is one hell of a defender
“What is the best PHHAAAARTY?”
I reckon he should move to Barcelona. 😉
THE BEST💯🤫😤
This guy got 2nd in the ballon d’or, arguably should have been first, and there’s people on here trying to clown him at this first sign of poor form after a lengthy injury. Just goes to show how revered he is.
Neville gonna curse him like Kane and pique 😂😂
Our Number 4💪💪
Top player but not on the same level as Stam, Rio, Vidic, Terry. Van Dijk has only won one league and champions league, plus he hasn't done it for as long as those guys did. Still a quality player though.
Vvd is honestly the best player I’ve seen play at Anfield live.  He literally has everything real football fans know how good he is, ignore the social media virgins
Most arrogant and cocky CB in the league . He’s been good for 3 years and people act like he’s a all time great . Playing his first World Cup at 30 😵‍💫
Gary taking money to promote Qatar, incredible hypocrisy from the champagne socialist
He was a monster at Southampton. I loved watching him at St Marys
Twerking for dippers now 🤢 oh Gary what have you become 🗑
Gary just keeps coming through
Peter Pan 😂😂
It's a pity. I was so curious what question 20 was . Maybe in another life time.. 😆👏
As a Chelsea fan, I can't rate Virgil high enough. First class player and seems like a very humble guy.
This was basically a Van Dijk advertisement to Barca to get him the f*ck out of this shambles of an LFC team
Didn’t realise Virgil was that tall 🤣
'best player you have played against?'  'Messi' VVD has also played against Penaldo by the way.
Ask him about his cross stopping technique
Rio was a Winner tho
Before all the disrespectful comments come in, just remember this man is still unbeaten at Anfield in league games, 5 years and counting what a stat!  Edit: This record was ended at 70 games, all good things must come to an end (sorry for the jinx Virgil lad).   P.S. the amount of salt on this thread just shows how good he is haha with success always comes a pack of haters. He has won every medal available to him at Liverpool ❤
His favourite holiday is the place I’m from lol
Awesome content
Man faced Valverde and was never the same after that.
Gary complaining about prices of going on holiday….
Love the guest even tho I’m a United fan
BIG VIRG! ... and Van Dijk
The most overrated defender ever.
We know the form is coming YNWA VVD
❤
