Early broccolis where are youuuuu 🩷
U need to shake the garlic in 100% metal bowls
I honestly still cannot believe there's people that don't like fresh watermelon (i do get that with any flavoring it's always a huge hit or miss). No judgement tho I'm picky af myself😭.
peeling garlic is really easy- take like the knife the thick side, lay it flat on the garlic and press down until you hear a crack
You can buy garlic that’s already peeled too!
Heyyy Naomi! A garlic trick i love is after you've taken the cloves off of the bulb you can place a knife flat on the clove and smash the flat part of the knife with the base of your palm and the skins just slide right off. Hope that makes sense and it helps💚🩷 🥦
I think the Shin ramen hack was a fail because Naomi used an entire box of mac and in the video she showed, the creator used one of the microwave cups. I wonder if they don't have the cups in Germany, wouldn't be surprised.  But that would be why there was so much cheese powder
MSG you know who that reminds me of 😭🤚🏿
17:52 Naomi: and I’m not gonna add cheese.  Naomi 2 seconds later: *adds parmesan*
The best hack for peeling garlic: use FRESH garlic. It is so easy to peel
1:53 NAMJOONIE HOW ARE U EVERYWHERE😭😭💗
for the hwachae, its supposed to be milk OR soda, not both! you can put both ofc but Amy, the creator of the original video, said one or the other not both 😊
Vincent's taste buds should be studded because who tf doesn't like WATERMELON??💀
Can I have the middle middle child PLEASE
15:50 Put the garlic in the microwave for a few seconds :)
i swear i watched this in my dream what
That is because your country outlawed the red die that causes Cancer be glad they did.
Where I live, the egg soup is a classic! I’ve had it so many times and truly love it
After watching your videos for a while now, I'm convinced you've got that thing with your DNA that makes sweeteners and artifical flavors taste bitter/detergenty. It's the same thing as when certain people taste cilantro as soap. When it actually doesn't taste like that at all. It's so interesting. Lol. I came here to say that.
1:35 I watched BTS make this on their show “in the soop,” where they were on like a staycation.. it was super cute.   2:16 also how wild is it that I just referenced BTS and you just used a clip of Namjoon from BTS singing “peaches,” 😂  crazy
freeze the garlic or drain in water before pealing
Mixing sprite and milk and bananas is a no, it will give you an upset stomach so fast
Queen if you add lemon to milk, the milk will curdle >.<
6:54  get back Satan!
Just letting you know that you should not add melons and banana or anything citrus with milk it can curdle and lead to digestive issues 😢
Quetsch eine Knoblauchzehe mit deinen fingern bißchen hin und her, dann geht die Schale fast wie von selbst ab. Mit beiden Zeigefingern und Daumen halten und dann in entgegengesetzte Richtungen drehen, oder du quetschst sie leicht mit dem Messer auf dem schneidbrett🤗
Quick way to peel garlic: The way we (Southeast Asian) do it at home is you put the garlic under the flat side of the knife and pound it. The garlic gets squeezed out from the peel.  You even mashed the garlic after cooking it, should've just mashed it way ahead of time. 😅
naomi u dont know how that shin ramen/mac and cheese combo changed my life . i could eat a whole pot every time
Here a year later
For the mac and cheese, you'll have to have the version made in the American South. We add paprika, salt, pepper and sometimes other spices to our cheese sauce and the drained macaroni. <3
The girl that popularised hwachae says that you should do strawberry milk OR soda, not to mix them
Warum bist du immer so cringe?
The mac and cheese needed milk not just butter
Smush your garlic with a knife :) it will crack all the sides off and makes it a super easy peel
Dont put lemon, the milk WILL curdle… maybe try opening the sprite and waiting for the gas to run out 😅
The egg drop soup is very similar to how my family maeks corn soup. But we add like chicken and pepper etc.
0:34 omg I really love her makeup and how much it suits her but I really wanna see her with natural makeup and hair! Love her and love how she looks
Cut the end part then place ur knife on top of the garlic then put it ur hand above it then press hard 15:53
7:46
I think if you guys want to make the hwache it might be better to use a strawberry milkis
4:33 the cat in the background is sooo cute 4:33
She goes through some many hair dyes and I’m here for it
please don't put lemon in milk
I definitely would put milk in the Mac n cheese! Just a cap full and it won’t be so dry☺️ I swear by it 🤞🏽
I just love Love LOVE eggdrop soup! as a hungarian girlie, my mom always made this when i was little, it's such a comfort food for me! <3
5:37 macaronii
Y’all the cat in the back lol 4:40
3:32  like I said it’s very good
It’s supposed to be strawberry milk or sprite that’s what she says and in the video she doesn’t use both that’s it
As a Hungarian I love and always eat egg soup it’s so good ❤
Idk how it is in Germany, but here in Czechia we put egg droppings into basically any broth based soup.
I really want to Naomi lipstick combination! It looks so good and stayed throughout the video
Try my aunt's Mac and cheese she uses so much cheese
I love the raging in German 😂😂😂😂
the hwache was meant to be made with strab. milk or sprite not both :3 !
Maybe try 7up it's like sprite but way less bitter n maybe nesquik strawberry milk I'm just thinking that probably with taste better but idk I haven't even tried it I just know 7up the sweeter version of sprite n nesquik milk is more flavorful
Ok ik I'm late super late but I noticed you posted this on my b-day can a get a happy broccoli day? @naomijon
i recommend adding some white pepper to your egg drop soup, it’s very good:)
brocoli cheddar soup and buldak carbonara so good DX
i wanted to get the samyang basil and cream noodles but they are fully sold out everywhere where i am
7:14 nah i laughed way too hard 😭
Egg drop soup is my childhood
I love cherry cola lips they look so cute on her♡♡
BRO EGG DROP SOUP IS ACTUALLY SO GOOD
Your makeup looks like the sigma characters in roblox😂
Naomi is the only person who understands my aversion to mac n cheese. Its really not good to me. I infinitely prefer just buttered noodles with a sprinkle of salt and pepper, and if I'm feeling fancy, I use wide egg noodles, Irish salted butter, (the Kerrygold is the best one for this particular dish) white pepper and then after the noodles are cooked and drained, melt your butter in the pot you used to boil the noodles, add garlic to taste (one whole average sized minced clove per person seems to be the sweet spot for MY personal taste) and make the butter nice and fragrant, then throw in a bag of frozen sweet peas with the garlic butter, (yes, an entire bag of them, you want LOTS of peas with this, it helps balance all the flavors together) get them almost warmed through entirely (like two minutes at the most, stirring almost constantly so the peas don't get any color from sitting on the heat) and then throw in a beaten egg and stir a LOT so that the egg kind of carbonara's into the sauce, but you still get some scrambled egg bits, and then throw the noodles in last so that they just get coated and combined, but not soak up the other flavors because you want the egg noodles taste to come through and compliment the slight eggy sauce. SO GOOD. I eat this literally once a week, every week. So simple but so GOOD.
i easily peel garlic by first smashing it with the knife while the annoying skin is still on :3c
In the mac and cheese shin ramen would taste better with a little bit of milk, to dilute the flavor,,
I love the way u did ur makeup
I love your hair
one thing abt the hwachee its supposed to have just sprite in it or strawberry milk both of them cannot be mixed together
0:10  * T R E S H *😊
14:04 THE REFERENCEE
❤❤❤❤❤❤
it is hot still😅😅😅😓😓😓😥😥😥💦💦💦😅🥵😥😪😓💦😰💧🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
Love your make up ❤
hi naomi jonster yasmin (cula) thinks ur cute
i didnt know egg drop soup was popular on tik tok, my mom makes it for me and my siblings regularly since we love it
Please do some more traditional foods😭 "Normal" cooking videos are so boring so I don't watch them often BUT naomis cooking is so entertaining!
Ich hab letzten Monat meine eigene version von hwachae gemacht: eiswürfel, gefrorene früchte, melone, sprite und vegane müllermilch erdbeer. So geil danke fürs erinnern 😂❤
Don’t put lemon in milk please it will curdle
Me encantan tus videos ❤
the makeup is SOO CUTE
if this video was uploaded now, I'd think her makeup was inspired by skz new album "ATE"
It’s called buldak ramen
Why does it look like her makeup is chipping off?
In my (American) household we have this little rubber/silicone tube that’s for peeling garlic. You just put the pieces inside and then roll it back and forth with a fair amount of pressure and it’s takes the skin right off! Hopefully there’s something like that in Germany. To be clear it is an actual product that is for this purpose and not a random silicone tube that we had lying around
boah hier stinkts ja nach KNOBLAUCH BOOOOAAAAA 🌸👹🌸👹
"herbs"❌ "erbs"✔
lol she forgot the milk for the mac n cheese and I think that would have made it less spicey
Your hair is stunning ❤❤
Girl, Mac needs milk lol
I love to make hwachae, and tbh the fizziness is one of my favorite parts. It makes it almost more zingy and I love that. I make it with coconut dairy alternative (the coconut milk that doesn't taste like coconut), sprite (roughly the same amount as the 'milk'), banana, honeydew, cantaloupe, peaches, pears, apples, grapes and pineapple and it's sooo good. One thing I will suggest is when you make it, add just a little of the syrup from the peaches. Not a lot, just a tad. It makes the punch a little more syrupy and less watery, and gives it a bit more sweetness. Also, never make it in advance. We learned out the hard way that it doesn't keep more than a day or two at most, so it's best to have the ingredients handy and put them together when you're ready to eat it, or maybe half an hour before.
You are definitely safe from vampires! 😂😂😂
Squish the garlic under a knife or something and you’ll be able to peel it really nicely
5:34 put cajun seasoning in your macaroni, its good.   I got a list cuz im good like that  Creole seasoning Slap ya mama  Its two items long but still its somewhat of a list        💀
I can't believe how beautiful is this cat 😍😍😍
2:28 LMAAOAOAAO WTH
ok ik this is abt food but how tf do you keep on your lip combo?!
you need a glass box for the garlic it works better❤️‍🔥
Next time just cut the top off of the garlic and then oil and pan in the oven once cooked you can just spoon out the garlic cloves and no peeling , 😊❤
You need to add salt and pepper to your Mac and cheese.
The part where she said not to add too much msg broke my asian heart it's literally just umami how could people be so afraid of deliciousness
I’m your biggest fan
05:20 you just don't like American cheese. Which is absolutely normal for a person, who ate some good cheese. :P
Ich hab auch mal so ein Insta-Garlic-Rezept nachgemacht und letztenendes musste ich es alleine essen, weil es meinem Freund gar nicht gefallen hat. Ich selbst fand's auch nicht so bombe, aber war zu stolz, um es zuzugeben... habe danach zwei Wochen lang aus allen Poren gottlos nach Knoblauch gerochen.
Anyone else see the hashtag #foodporn in the desc..? No? Ok.
she broke her own boundaries
Not sure if you dont drink it or something, but you usually add milk instead of water to deal with any dryness and also add creamy ness
Mac and Chen😭
They make rubber garlic rolling tubes
Girl!!!! Not the lemon please you're drinking milk.. adding lemon to it makes it curdled and then you'll have an upset stomach. Milk and lemon are not friends they just make an entirely different things aka cottage cheese.
for the garlic, i always grab one or two garlic cloves on a cutting board and grab a knife and just press as hard as i can but the knife has to be horizontal for it to work, and then thats allllll 😋
Every time I’ve ever been feeling sick I order egg drop soup from our local Chinese food place and it eases up the tummy so much!
4:39 THE WAY UR GATO IS SITTING BRO HAHAHAH
Her makeup in  every video:😍💖💝💓🫶
My mom always bought us egg drop soup from our fav Chinese restaurant whenever we weee sick!
me eating my MAC over here is saddened now lmao
With the garlic put with hot water for a couple of minutes and yeah🤠🤠🤠
Ich kann meine Buldag Ramen Carbonara auch nur mit der Hälfte der Soße und einer Kugel Mozzarella nebenbei zum löschen essen xD Aber dann liebe ich sie :D
just smash the garlic under a knife
I do that with orange juice
Hey Naomi, bei Knobloch schneide ich den unteren Teil immer ab und zerdrücke die Zehe dann mit dem Messer. Danach fällt die Schale quasi von alleine ab😅
I would like to watch you eat as anime characters for a week
to properly peal a clove of garlic, put the garlic on a cutting board press ur knife down on it on each side then cut off the stems and it should peal off easily <3
my only complaint with Naomi Jon is i need her to upload more because I love her videos so much! xD
For the egg drop soup your soup in the pot shouldve been a little bit hotter, that way the eggs wouldve been a little bit thicker and stringier
you need to cut off the ends of the garlic for that hack before you put them in the tuperware
Pleasant , relaxing it’s warming my body from inside 😂
4:40 the cat lol 😭😭😭
Naomi looks like Roxanne wolf from FNAF security breach with that makeup and it's an good thing💯
"YoU dIDN't hAVe aNY ON yOUR SpOoOoOOooN" Had me cracking up xDD
That random clip of Namjoon singing made me jump from my sit 😂
does anybody know the lip combo she has on it looks so good...
“I don’t add cheese to everything guys” immediately cuts to sprinkling Parmesan on the pasta😂
ich weiß ich bin 4 monate zu spät, aber um die Knoblauchzehen richtig zu schälen, musst du oben und unten das Ding abschneiden dann ein bisschen Wasser drauf machen und dann in die Dose und schütteln. Funktioniert jedes Mal.
"Im not going to put cheese on it for once" *proceeds to put cheese over the pasta*
15:53 my eastern european grandma taught me to press the edge of a big knife on a clove of garlic hard enough until u hear a noise, not completely crush it ofc. it separates the skin from the clove it takes 5 mins and it’s truly magic
What lipstick is she using like the fact that the lip stick is staying on while she eats the noodles is crazzzyyyyy
to peel the garlic you just need to put the flat side of a knife on the garlic clove and press down with your hand and the clove will crush a little bit and slide out of the peel ;)
4:41 the way he sitting
4:42 the way the cat was sitting like a human ☠️🤣
I got jumpscared with a Namjoon clip less than 2 mins in and I aint complaining :P
GIRLY POP TRY SOME SOUL FOOD MAC AND CHEESE OR SOME PEPPA IN IT!!!!!! That’s the shmackin kind of Mac and cheese
I don't get Mac n cheese either
Can u do video where u cook traditional country food and try Lithuania (you not gonna regret it)
My stomach hurts just watching you eating so much garlic !
Naomi : Vincent, do you like it ? Vincent : peach !
Try ramen whit sourcream 😍
Not Naomi totally dissing Mac and cheese aka my fave pasta ever and what I literally grew up on 😂
You forgot to say trash😢😢😢
“For some reason “
15:49 slap\smash the garlic with a cup or something HARD, 😭😭💀💀💀
The way the cat is sitting in the back around tge 4:50 mark 😂😂😂
Garlic - get yourself one of those silicone rollertubes, pop the garlic into it and roll against the table, it should pop out all clean. Magic.
my mom used to make egg drop soup for me when i was sick as a kid, in german she calls it "Eierflockensuppe" 😂
I love Cheeto on the background lol so cute
Not her having my name
4:48 LOOK ATTHE CAR IN BACKGROUND 😭
My mom soaks the garlic in water for a while, it makes the peeling process easier.
Just put garlic aoli in spicy ramen with cheese and i have no regrets
You need to go to a Black cookout. I can assure you, you will LOOOOOOOVE macncheese. ❤
Can you please do more food Related videos
Hey naomi …about garlic you can use your knife and press it on the garlic like in a hard way then you will see it got naked so so easily ,love you so much ❤️
İf u let ur garlics soak some water before peel it (about 10-15mins), it would be so much easyer
Lol I literally recognize that makeup from a tik tok about mascara for eyeliner 😂
Die rote Grütze ist wie ein Grießpudding mit Wasser 😅
I hate Mac and cheese Im happy somebody gets it
namjoon!
Wenn du den Knoblauch leicht mit den Messer platt drückst, geht die Haut ganz einfach und am Stück ab 🧄❤🧄
I don't know how I fall into your demographic, but I'm so happy that I do. ❤
Usually, if you bake the garlic in the oven, just let it like it is and you can just squeeze it out after it cooled down. If you're not going to do it in the oven, you can put the garlic in the microwave for 2/3 seconds and then peel the skin off easily, that's how I do it.
Auf den Knoblauch raushauen mitn messer
naomi: this is so much more spicy then shin ramen by itself, i dont know why?  *three seconds earlier, puts water on on the ramen* naomi.. water only makes thing spicier.. lmao
20:20 MIAUW- hmgmgkhmkhgj  👹👹
But some minced garlic it’ll save your life
you gotta crush the garlic with the flat part of ur knife then the skin comes off super easy
Just started watching you,love your videos,your German accent kinda scares me(I’m Jewish)
You need jesus
Ich glaube es wäre besser gewesen die Nudeln fürs Mac and cheese in Milch zu kochen. Dann würden die nicht so trocken sein.
Peeling garlic tip : soak them in water for about 10 minutes and then peel, it will be very easy but might be slippery for first use
She needs to try Caribbean Mac and cheese pie
I love udon noodles yum
6:18 No wonder you don't like mac and cheese😂 you keep on using the powder!
Put pastina in your egg soup the next time. My mum used to make it for me when I was little and didn't want to eat 😊
Gotta give you my cheesy pasta sauce recipe 👀👀
Jesus loves ya
There is also egg soup in Hungary sometimes eaten with vinegar
She jus added the whole packet of seasoning for that small amt of macaroni 🤷
i think you normally add milk to the kraft mac n cheese?
Naomi: taking THIS amount of garlic to one dish my liver: *dies*
Babbeeeee you can’t mix milk and lemon🥹🥹
I've done the garlic thing using two metal bowls. I think the metal helps beat the skins on the garlic better than the soft plastic. I usually have to do a couple rounds of shaking, then fishing out the naked garlic cloves and paper until they are all peeled, I wonder if it has to do with the size and shape of the bowls I use.  I still prefer this method because the garlic smell sticks to my fingers for up to a week.
Hey Naomi you can find pre-peeled garlic in asian grocery stores. You won't need to peel it.
✨ peach ✨
The Brand of Mac n Cheese I get is Great Value Artisan Crafted Gouda Mac n Cheese.
it's Kraft Brand Mac n Cheese it sucks, I get Gouda Mac n Cheese, it tastes a LOT better.
Sooooo hot.
Lemon makes the milk go bad so I don’t recommend it 😂
Du bist die beste NAOMI JON ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love the way she says basil ❤😂
Naomi you need some black ppl food in your life😫
If you use a tall glass jar instead of the plastic container to peel the garlic. It works very well for me!!
Einfach Monkey Island Sound wenn Sie die Nudeln isst😂18:07
Vincent doesn’t like WATERMELON WTF
I grew up drinking milk with cream soda, honestly tastes so fricking amazing
For peeling garlic I just gentle squeeze and twist the skin back and forth until it cracks off.
I honestly love how often One Piece sounds appeared in this video haha
the way i peel garlic i smash them with a pan and the peel comes right off
You stirred it too fast
1:51 Namjoon😭😭-
1:52 LMAO NAMJOON
*It's me, I'm here. I'm the one who recognized the Monkey Island soundtrack at **18:06* 🏴‍☠️🦜
You can crush the garlic with the knife a little bit and it will be easier to peel, that's how I do it.
Pls Naomi. Don't mix milk with lemons...
I love the one piece sounds
Free Pal.estine
the best tip to quickly peel the garlic is knead it with knife fr this is game changer (;
You forgot the milch in the mac n cheese. 😩
for the garlic, if you chop the ends of the cloves  first the outer layer comes right off :)
2:06 2:07
Love you
Did you add milk to the Mac and cheese?
Where’s that lipstick from thoooo 😭😍❤️
Soak the garlic in cold water about 5 minutes. That’ll do it.
For Alfredo you make a roux first, which is why you ended up with Alfredo soup haha. You made me wish I liked Alfredo sauce though
if you dont like macaroni plaine one thing at least i love is ketchup on it it makes it sweet
😊
try adding flour into Alfredo while cooking the sauce to thicken it up!
There’s the lil silicone ‘sleeve’ to put your garlics in, then you squeeze and it’s supposed to magically undress the garlic cloves! I haven’t tried it yet but plan to...
Those noodles look like Udon. The nice thicc chewy ones!
6:39
I miss eating instant noodles but, they literally mess me up 😢.
Mac and cheese needs milk that’s why it was strong
Lemon will curdle milk! It's probably better to just pour the sprite back an forth in two glasses to make the bubbles dissappear if you prefer it non fizzy ☺
wenn du die Knoblauchzehen einzeln etwas mit der hans zerdrückst, bis es etwas knackst kannst du die Schale ganz einfach entfernen
Did you forget to add the milk to the mac n cheese mix?
6:38 not Naomi fueling my cheese addiction, while I’m lactose intolerant
Not naomi full making on with the custard
4:49 the way your cat is just sitting there in the background motionless, staring into the distance is killing me😭
it's a classic Czech soup, but it's called "dripping" in Czech kapání , my grandmother used to make it for me all the time. the recipe comes from Moravia, where poor landowners used to cook from what they grew.😂
My uncle does the egg soup every Christmas for lunch and we call it stracciatella (which confused me so much as a kid)
Wenn du eine Knoblauch Zehe peelen willst:  Leg sie hin, schneide das vordere und hintere harte Teil ab, leg ein Messer flach oben drauf, und hau auf das Messer , also auf die Klinge die flach auf der Zehe ist.  Das funktioniert immer 😊
it’s literally 2:05am for me while watching this video💀💀😭😭😭
You forgot the milk in the noodles
Easy italian way to peal a garlic: submerge them in a cup of tap water for 10 min. Done.
You should try Mac and cheese with extra cheese and tuna
At the First recipe u forgot the ice
Lemon will make the milk curdle
Naomi, put the garlic under the water for a few minutes. You’ll see, it’s almost magic and it’s super easy to peel the garlic
lemon + milk is not going to give the result you expect hahaha and I peel garlic just by stabing a clove with a knive and taking it out of the whole... thing :D
I cheat and buy peeled garlic lol
I think you needed to add some plant milk to the Mac and cheese. Normally it would have milk 💚
meanwhile in Poland we eat "egg drop soup" but with milk and sugar : Recipe: 2 glasses of Milk 2 eggs 40g wheat flour a pinch of salt Sift the flour, pour it into a jug, add the egg, mix and knead with a spoon until bubbles begin to form.  Add 1 cup of water to the milk, bring to a boil and add salt.  Pour the dough from the jug in a thin stream into the boiling milk, mix and bring to a boil.  you're welcome
Ich hab nen Knoblauch Tipp, ich versuchs mal zu beschreiben 😅 Du schneidest ein klein wenig von den beiden Enden der Knoblauchzehe ab. Dann schneidest längs in die Knoblauchzehe von einem Ende bis zum anderen ein. Und dann kannst du die Knoblauchschale ganz einfach abziehen. Der Längsschnitt macht es möglich die Schale manchmal sogar in einem abzuziehen, hoffe das hat geholfen ☺️ Viel Glück 🥦🩷
Babe, you forgot to add milk to the mac N cheese ❤
For easy garlic peel removal just ;et them soak 30 mins in water. it will just peel right off. :D
Peel garlic after roasting. It squeezes out like toothpaste. Wear gloves.
Get an crockpot & make your own bone broth or vegetable stock. 12 hours will change your life. Freeze in smaller portions. Will change your ramen game! Perfect for egg drop soup.
The first one was like a polish zupa owocowa on steroids
The WAY I  LOL'd at "Cheesus Christ"!! 😆🤣🤭🫢🤫🫣🧀✝️🙏
To peel garlic super easily, break apart all the cloves and soak them in warm water for a few minutes and then the skin comes off really easily.
just push down on the garlic with your hand or the side of a knife till it cracks and then it peels really easily!
It‘s 5:00 in the morning and I‘m just chilling on my couch cuddled up in my blanket and watching Naomis videos 🙈 Naomis channel is just such a feel good vibe and place ❤️ love her
Always add seasonings to the Mac and you’ll love it❤
sigh i hate seeing egg drop soup seen as a ramen hack
I’m glad I’m not the only one who gets suuuuper gas-y after eating lots of garlic!😅
Wenn du die strawberry milk pink haben willst einfach müllermilch kaufen😍
9:44 for the egg consistency u should pour the egg a lil by lil nd don’t stir it
If you would've added a little milk to the Mac and cheese it would've been creamier ☺️
Peeling garlic: just cut the end of the garlic off and then smash the garlic with the side of the knife.. the peel should just come right off.  (You don’t have to be too careful with the smashing :D)
you can buy pre-pealed garlic, it comes in jars usually
Egg drop soup looks like stomach contents 🤢
Non esiste la pasta Alfredo in Italia BASTA
My mum told me that soaking garlic in a bowl of water for like, 20 or so minutes, makes peeling whole cloves much more easier. It's also less tedious and less time consuming... so you could give that a try? :)
"I am not adding cheese" 1 sekond later: puts parmesan in it 😂
asmr from that fruit soup, crown of my head is still tingling
I think if you shake the 💩 out of the sprite you can make it go flat, keep the flavor lose the fizz! Shout out to Namjoon's 🍑's!
Her music is amazing but her other videos are just unhinged and i live for it thats why i love her 😊
She looks like a Gremlinnnnn
The Huungarian version of egg drop soup is seasoned with paprika, caraway seeds and bay leaves, apart from salt and pepper of course. Some also put a little vinegar in it, but since my dad despised vinegar, we rarely ate it like that
To peel garlic more easily put the side of the blade from your knife on the clove and smash it with your hand from the top. Afterwards you can easily remove the skin.  One of my fav kitchen hacks 😋
To peel a lot of garlic you put it in a container and shake it and if some of them don't peel you put warm water in and let them sit there for a bit, they peel super easy after. Thank me later :)
AHH NAMJOON
For the garlic, if you cut a bit of the bottle of the clove off then the peel comes off pretty easy.
My best working garlic peeling technique is to take a piece, cut just a bit of the tip and bottom and straight up begin twisting the garlic (dont go too ham at it or you will crush the garlic) and the skin comes right off! Super fast and easy
Namjoon making a special appearance ❤️
Her makeup is always Poppin
you can buy garlic cloves by thmeselves
First meal- carbonation & milk= sour milk taste
PLSS TRY BRAZILIAN FOOOOD! LOV U ♥
Throw the Garlic in the microwave for a few seconds some pieces will be peeled already bit if they aren't it will defo be easier to peel after microwaving it
Heyyy you're wearing the look that i copied from youuuuuu. 💓💓
i make garlic confi sandwiches 😍😍😍
Egg drop soup reminds me so much of milk soup now I'm craving it lmao
Got to smash the garlic with a knife
Is it me or she has diamonds on her teeth 💀
tipp for peeling garlic: press it down with the side of your knife and you can peel it easily
chili zoning out on the background (๑ↀᆺↀ๑)
with the mac and cheese and shin ramen hack u needed to used the cup size kraft version  because they give u the right amount of cheese powder
My sister once made some AMAZING mac n cheese it had some crispy thing ontop of it and it was so damn good
you can never have to much garlic in dishes xD
omg Vincent is so me i hate melon and artificial watermelon taste too!!
Our tip for garlic - soak in hot water to loosen skins
I buy fresh peeled garlic cloves from Spice World it's perfect for my lazy ass
Ahh I absolutely love egg drop soup 😍😍
7:32 Naomi you forgot the milk Mac and cheese requires milk babe 🥹😩😩😂
a trick for the Garlic is to put it in the water 10 minutes before the recipe and to get the smell out of your hands you wash them with salt and soap together, I don't speak English as my native language but I hope you understand me lol... kisses from your Brazilian broccoli.
DONT SQUEEZE LEMON IN THE FIRST RECIPE IT WILL CURDLE YOUR MILKKKKKKKKK
Ew go back to saying twitterrrr😭😭
Bazle?? I think it's pronounced as bay-zel
I am in love with the fact that Naomi is so confident with her makeup, it looks really good and I could never have the confidence to go out in public like that ( ever ) NAOMI UR THE QUEEN OF MAKE-UP!! ❤
4:37 the way the cat is just sitting on his butt behind her just chilling 😂
The Monkey Island theme gave me a shot od dopamine <3
I tried the egg drop soup and it was so good, I loved it.
Naomi, du bist meine Käseschwester im Geiste 🧀🐭
GIRL WE HAVE THE SAME MICROWAVE
I always poor boiled(mircrowave for a little bit) water on top of the garlic and let it sit and then it should be really easy to peel. You still have to sluce an end to make it easy to pull off
7:08 its actually real cheddar cheese
Take the side of your chefs knife and put it on the garlic and smack down on it. It will peel a good bit of skin off!
An easier way to peel garlic, is cut both ends of and smash the garlic with your knife with thee flat side. Just a little bit, you should be able to get the skin off
Doesn’t lemon juice curdle milk? Maybe like a lemon jello?
In America we have pre peeled garlic at Costco
Lol you also got pennywise bunny teeth now
Lol i thought you got braces 1:52
what happened to censorship of eating sounds?? iliterally cant watch the video beacause of it
Damn, you bought the most ghetto rote Grütze out there, grandma would not approve
Eggdrop soup was every hungarian kids childhood
You can also combine egg drop soup with ramen! I do it all the time ❤
Egg drops soup is my favorite too, some places add stuff to it like corn but I'm a purist, all you need is salt and pepper mmmmm =)
Garlic tip. Microwave for 10 seconds,  smash with knife, easy peel
Probably the most common method for peeling garlic is where you place your knife over the clove and give the knife a sharp whack with your hand. This method is supposed to loosen up the skin so that it comes off easily.
My grandpa makes Kraft mac & cheese every week since me and my siblings have been alive. (My older brother is 22.) You need to add some kind of milk and use less powder if you don’t add milk
You need to try ramen w cheesy corn topping 🤌🏽🤌🏽🤌🏽🔥🔥
"I won't put chiz on everything ok" *"adds chiz"*
There is that much cheese inside the macaroni packet because most people don't eat the whole box at all once, people eat some of the macaroni so they have  so much so  you have enough for another day
Someone's probably already said this, but try crushing the garlic before peeling, I use the side of the knife, works like a charm
Garlic forever 😂
NEVER ENOUGH GARLIC and brocolissss 😏👑
You have to stir it waaaay slower and more carefully
Instead of cornstarch use Xanthan, high in fiber too and makes it almost slimy in a good way. But don't use much. With not even a lot you could make jelly
If your having digestive problems, egg drop soup is the key. Using pork belly while simmering the brath before and/or adding fond is just a dream in any season
I love eggdrop soup. Protein and vegs and fucking healthy. MSG is the game changer.  In Rome I had one of the best soups in my life and probably one of the cheapest ones too lol which was an asparagus crab meat soup, absolutely out of this world
Love the make up look
There is a garlic peeler where you just roll the garlic in it and it peels
Garlic 21 times
15:50 microwave the garlic for 10sec
cutting off the tops and bottoms of the garlic cloves makes peeling them super easy
Ein Tipp zum Knoblauch schälen: einfach nach Silikon-Rollen zum Knoblauch schälen suchen, es funktioniert so gut.
Is the first recipe supposed to be an Arabic thingy? I never heard that is Korean, it was always Arabic kind of snack😅
Not the one piece track playing at 13:25 😭😭😭
A trick for the garlic is to take a knife and with the side of the knife lay it on the garlic and push down on it with your hand until you hear a little sound and voila
Crush the garlic with your knife and it will peel itself works for me everytime
yall is it just me or does Naomi lowkey looks like shalom harlow
4:49 the cat is sitting like an human ahahaha
7:57 my grandma always put the egg in like that when she made BUCHSTABENSUPPE
Maybe add a little bit of milk to the Mac and cheese and ramen
11:02 the Trapnest song killed me😭
what kind of homemade mac have you had and where from?? i usually ask cause when ppl say they don’t like it it’s cause they’ve only had mac with like one to two cheeses in it, not to say if you had another one you’d like it, just curios 😅
Den Knoblauch kannst du einfach machen, indem du oben einen Teil abschneidest (sodass man die Knoblauchzehen sieht) und dann Öl drüber, in Alu Folie und dann in den Ofen. Danach kannst du den Knoblauch mit der Hand rauspressen und er ist weich. 🙌🏼 Lieb deine Videos. 😍
Broth wasn’t hot enough when put in eggs
I think you forgot the milk in the Mac and cheese
The idea of carbonation and milk is terrible
omg slayyyyy
I am just writing to let you know that I really enjoy your content. Your authenticity is really beautiful and captivating. You are a dope soul love. Keep shining and inspiring newish broccolis like myself. Fun fact.. Broccoli is my fav! 😘

I’m german living in the US. Your german references are healing my homesickness 🥺❤
My mom buys watermelons that she can't finish so i blend them up with some strawberries and my supplements until i finally finish it all.
im not sure if they would carry them in germany, but in the us some asian grocery marts sell whole bags of peeled garlic for really cheap!
Not me being Filipino who loves a lot of garlic on garlic fried rice, peanuts, adobo, sinamak or spiced vinegar, etc... Like we loooove garlic, and also onion hehheehehhee

hiya, girlfriend of a professional cook here, the easiest way to peel garlic is to cut off the top and bottom of the clove (just a little bit, like you would with other veggies) and then you lay your knife on top, like not with the sharp end but on the side, flat on top with the wide side (idk how to better describe) and then you give it one or two hits with your closed hand/fist and this breaks the peel in pieces, then you can very easily take it off - this is the quickest way I know that is also fool proof
Easiest way to peel garlic is just to smash it. Use the big flat end of a large knife and lean your body weight on the knife on the garlic. Peels right off.
Metal bowls are amazing for peeling garlic.
Naomi insted of making the garlic with oil, try to wrap a garlic head (just cut the top edge with a knife) in alluminum foil and put it in the air fryer for 20 minutes at 170°C. The garlic cloves are super soft and you can squeeze them out
For garlic just stomp the piece at tail or in middle little hard by hand and you get a little crack n just peel it off from there
press the garlic with the knife to peel it
So, about the garlic: we use it in every food haha. The way that i do is pressing the side of the knife over the garlic than cut the hard part of the sides, that makes very easy to peal them
Growing up my mom always used a really cool trick and I learned it growing up and I use it every day when I’m making some sort of meal with garlic grabbed your knife and garlic cloves make sure the individual and get the Side of your knife push it down on the side of the garlic, and  the skin will come right off and you can just peel it right off.
13:19
my trick to peeling garlic quickly is to take the side of you knife and smash it onto the cutting board.... then cut off the base and all the skin should come right off with that =)
FINALLYY SOMEONE AGREES WITH MEEE, mac and cheese taste blend even tho its home made :s
You need to come have Mac and Cheese in South Africa! It’s anything but bland!
Squash the garlic with a knife, makes it soo much easier to peel☺️
if you want to easily peel garlic, use a bigger knife (a nice chefs knife) and use the side of it to crush the garlic. so place garlic piece down and turn knife so that the flat side is facing upwards, then push down onto the garlic. you can smack the knife but obviously be careful. when you hear a crack noise then the "shell" around it has broken and can much easily be taken off. Hope you try this method and i hope it works for you!
Girl I ordered the whole collection of lashes and eyeliners on Sept 11 and just got notified it's being returned to sender 😢😢😢😢 I know it's not your fault just sad about it.
If you want your egg in your soup to look like the inspo video, you need to add it in a boiling soup.
Tresh ❤❤❤
Try to cut off the bottom of the garlic cloves and squish them a little with the side of you knife on your cutting board👌🏽 love your content❤❤
I'm always here for the German rages❤
This video made me so hungry 😇
Egg drop soup is my go to when I go to any Chinese restaurant. But ESPECIALLY when I’m sick or have an upset stomach
for the garlic just use a tomato smasher and press down and yeah
You stirred the egg drop soup to fast
next time put the garlic in hot water it really works
Naomiiiii your hair ❤  Also I had a silicone tube where you put the garlic inside and roll it... and then it got peeled but since it was like cheap plastic at some point it took the garlic smell and it had to go😂😂😂😂 I got it from AliExpress 😂✌️
Why does everybody keep mentioning the devil? 🤨
How to peel a garlic is you take you knight jist push ot in to your garlic one at a time or tree i have been doing it for 3years and it helps a lot
pls hurry & get her to 3M, the 2.9 is annoying me
Tip for peeling a lot of garlic at the same time: Pour some boiling hot water in a large bowl and drop all the garlic in there for like 1-2 minutes. You should be able to peel them just fine after that, the skin will almost slip off without any effort.
Soak the garlic for few minutes in water the skin will become soft it will become easier to peel... I learned this tip from my maternal grandma and it works every time.
Love ur haircut!!!💚💚💚
What is namjoon doing here 😂💜
are you a make artist? because your makeup is literal ✨ART✨
I wouldn't add lemon juice to milk because it can curdle and then it'll just be gross 😂  before you know it you make homemade mozzarella when you were trying to make a fruit milk soup dessert ❤
Is Vincent naomi's boyfriend?
just twist the garlic cloves. idk what's with all the bowls ontop of bowls and pans and shaking hacks lol literally just twist it gently and the peel separates 99% of the time. you can also stick a knife in the clove and again gently twist and it comes right off if you do it right. or you can also smash them slightly which makes it separate as well but it can get messier so i don't prefer it. theres so many better ways to peel garlic than anything i see suggested in the comments here lol  it's just overcomplicating it and doesn't always work as...shown by naomi in this very video.
If you do any giveawsys on your lashes or anything let me know cuz i cannot afford to buy unfortunately ☹️. Struggling just to eat and get by each day.
You shouldve put the 1/4 cup of milk that the mac n cheese calls for. That would have calmed down some of that strong cheese powder taste
Naomi! PEELING GARLIC SUPER EASILY, kitchen chef tip : just place your palms on the LARGE side of a kitchen knife (not the cutting side please),  press it on the garlic glove, crush it firmly (it's very satisfying), and voila: the glove will be removed automatically. The garlic will be a little crushed, but naked 🤌you can peel dozens of garlics super fast this way.
If You want to peel garlic faster and much more easier You suppose to crush the clove with the side of a knife. One little crush and it comes right off ❤
For the Mac and cheese shin ramen hack I’d say cook them in full fat milk then add the spices . It would be creamer and the spiciness would decrease.
your stirred it too much and too fast. I dont start stirring the egg until some of it solidifies and rises
If you press down on the garlic with your palm it's supposed to make peeling it a lot easier.☺️🤗🥦
Nimm ein fettes messer. Leg die knoblauch zehe auf ein brett, die flache seite vom messer drauf, dann druck mit dem ballen deiner freien hand ordentlich drauf. Manchmal bricht auch die zehe dabei auf. Macht nix. Aber Schälen ist danach ein klacks
The garlic: 👁️👄👁️
I make it without fizz, too
In indonesia you can find it EVERYWHERE.. here it made with siroup and condese milk the we add water OR sprite
You obviously have not had correct cheese sauce for Mac n cheese
If you use the flat side of a knife to crush a garlic clove, you can peel it easier. Wink wink.
For the garlic, I rip appart the  cloves, put them in a bowl and cover it with water. Leave it for 10 minutes, it will peal almost automatically !
It’s not related to the video…but GIRL!!! The black Naomi  eyeliner is so good. I could cry. I never hat such a good eyeliner. 😭😭😭😭😭. Please never stop producing this. I will die.
u poured too much egg at once and stirred too fast
Gönnt euch 😂😂
That egg dropping food, my family calls it "ichi". when you add the egg, you're suppose to turn off the heat. And then slowly stir it. Stop stirring and Give a second or two for the egg to cook with the broth, and then start to slowly stir again so that the egg doesnt look like puke. And i think you can add a bit more corn starch there.
Be careful how often you eat products that your body is telling you are "too spicy" for you as yummy as they are you can develop an chilli intolerance then won't be able to eat them anymore as it becomes a very...very painful experience with vomiting, stomach cramps, and diarrhoea. 😢yes I'm speaking from experience. I used to eat/love spicy food constantly now I physically can't eat it anymore! Sadge
maybe dont add water to the egg mix and it will come out thicker. I have added eggs to soups like that and have not had an issue with thickness. Love your videos!
Just open the sprite and let it go flat
Try mixing a little mustard into your mac and cheese. It adds a much needed zing
anytime i need hair inspo i just go through four videos hahhahdhdwauda it looks great btw
Come to our family’s holiday gatherings. You’ll LOVE our mac’ and cheese !
I’m with Vincent; watermelon is GROSS!
the egg drop soup in the uk is just Chinese soup from the Chinese restaurant
I still can't believe the cat was sitting on the bed.
Do you think when your music career takes off you’ll change? That you won’t do this anymore?
You haven't had that down south mac and cheese. It will blow your mind
Every time I watch these videos I CRAVE ramen.
18:00 yes, very heavenly sound naomi
17:53 "I'm not going to add grated cheese" **literally 2 seconds later** **adding grated cheese**
Try the egg soup with “Buchstaben Nudeln” it is soo good🤤
Veggies (corn, cabbage, carrots) in your egg drop soup and boiled chicken. Thank me later
naomi noooo extra virgin olive oil is actually not suitable for heating, when heating it toxins come out
I can ship you the pink ones
NAOMI DID NOT JUST EAT BANANA WITH SPRITE
Cut the tips of the piece of garlic and then lay the knife flat on the garlic and slam down on it with your hand the peel will come right off
The best trick to peel garlic is to cut off the ends of the clove and then press on it with the flat side of your knife. 9/10 times the peel comes right off! Hope this helps🤗 Liebe Grüße!
Question have you heard of Joost klein  friesenjung                greetings from the Netherlands
Put the garlic in water for a couple of minutes, this makes the pealing much easier
Please do one episode only in  German!!❤❤
I immediately thought of that "That's what good p**** sounds like" vine when I saw the Mac n cheese part 😀 I'm scarred for life because of that app
« I’m not gonna add cheese » just added parmesan and proceded to add more on top😂
Mind you, each recipe probably had 3% lipstick involved for full experience, don't forget to wear it
In our house we call Kraft Mac and Cheese, Crap Mac and Cheese
girlfriend, for the peeling of garlic cloves you gotta get a silicone garlic peeler, it's life changing
For the garlic i suggest let it soak in water for a while until the skin becomes soft and then peel it with a small knife. Thats what i usually do!
cut the garlic roots off, cut each clove in half length wise. take off the skin like a jacket. much love from your broccoli
HOW DOES YOUR LIPSTICK STAY💀
I only watch ur vids for the “TrEsH “
Come to Texas and try Mac n cheese
bazelle
About the garlic just buy peeled garlic 💀
I 100% thought she was going to try the cottage cheese and mustard trend😭
Naomi to fall asleep is my natural form
In Mexico, I don’t know why, we don’t mix watermelon and milk, for instance, if i ate watermelon, I won’t drink milk later in the day. I think it gives you the runs
Are you not suppose to add some milk? 🥛for the Mac and cheese?
Try using hot water on garlic cloves it peels them super easy!!  😁 love your videos!
not naomi being and army im here for it lol
I feel like if you put lemon juice in the milk it might curdle it? But idk…maybe just put less Sprite and that maybe better 😊
Just smash the garlic against the cutting board with the flat of your knife
Hey Naomi:) you probably won’t see my comment but if you lay the garlic down and lay the flat side of your knife over the garlic and squish it, you should be able to get the peeling off quite easy :). Take care!
Naomi needs to try Black max and cheese 🤣
Best way for me to peel garlic is to smash it with the side of the knife, then the skin will come right off in one piece
Woher sind die Nasenringe?😍
I have a dish thats's similar that I came up with years ago as a kid. Fresh watermelon banana grapes and strawberry jam with ice cubes. Much much tastier.
Like what?
im deaaad her cute lil lisp
9:49 ME - gluten&dairy free Saw video,  made soup with brown rice Ramen noodle... very like😂❤😊 thx NAOMI
Not me having the same bowl for the garlic Alfredo
help not namjoon popping out of nowhere
naomi have you ever had good mac and cheese? if its not flavorful enough then add some😂 boil the pasta in broth and add msg
egg drop soup you have to swirl the water before you drop the egg and not mix
ur supposed to mix the cheese powder with milk and butter and then pour it over ur mac. it says that on the box😂😂 i am a velveeta girl tho. in america you either like kraft or velveeta. velveeta has a packet too but its actual sauce. i def recommend trying it the original. theres offbrands but theyre not the same.
Am I the only one that had to watch to ADS before watching this video
To peel cloves of garlic, you grab your clove, put it on a cutting board, then grab a knife, lay the flat part of the blade on the garlic, and with your other hand you swat the flat part of the knife, to smash the clove. Don't hit too hard or you'll just have mashed garlic. Then, you can cut the "butt" of the garlic, and all the peel will come off (most of it comes off after swatting it anyway). The key is in how hard you smash it, there's a good middle ground
Actually fun fact: not every country has fizzy sprite and/or fanta!!  Us Germans just love bubbly drinks 😂❤
@naomijon tipp um ✨garlic✨ zu schälen! nimm ein grosses Küchenmesser und drück mit der flachen Seite auf den 🧄-Zehen! btw you‘re sooo cool naomi 🫶🏼☺️
I've done the Raman and Mac and cheese one before but instead of Mac and cheese I used bow-tie noodles and added cheese and it was very good
Ad the garlic to the soup and marjoram and some potato. Thats good shiiii.
Naomi not liking Mac and cheese was not on my 2023 bingo board
Extra virgin olive oil is the most sensitive to heat. You regular for high tempature.
So when it comes to Mac n cheese you don't add water to make it more creamy if it's too dry....you add milk (I use almond milk because I am lactose intolerant). Same for if you want to thin out eggs, you typically add milk. Then poor the egg slowly and stir slowly to prevent breaking the egg ribbons. Love me some egg drop soup 😊..gonna try the Ramen hack because I love Mac n cheese lol 😅
WHERE CAN I GET THE STRAWBERRY BEDSHEETS OMGG
Naomi don’t put lemon in the fruit soup next time u make it!!! it’ll curdle the milk 😭😭😭
4:41 THE WAY CHILI IS JUST SITTING IN THE BACK IS KILLING ME
crush the garlic, so seriously, take your knife and lay it flat on a corner of the garlic and crush it. but don't smash it. it'll pop open making it easier to peal.
After a 3 day of work and finally today im free i can finally watch my chaos queen😝😍
*1:01** Omg this reminds me of an Asian fruit dish called 'Fruit Chaat' it's the most beautifulest most REFRESHING thing ever and the juice also has spices!! you should try*

I really need to know where that shirt is from😫😫😫😫😫😫
A week of shin ramen recipes that’s an idea 🫂
guys msg is not healthy at all, try not to consume it too much
Ich weiß nicht, wie man große Mengen Knoblauch auf einmal schält, aber mit einzelnen Zehen mache ich es so, ich halte ein großes Messer flach über die Zehe, haue einmal darauf, und dann kann man die komplette Schale auf einmal entfernen 🤗
The egg didn't look right because you added water to your eggs. You just mix them and then pour. Do not add water
I just tried the egg drop soup it tasted good but the egg smell was unbearable
لو تفرش سنه قدام ماراح تروح الريحه هههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههه
My technique to peel garlic easily : place the garlic clove on a chopping board. Take a fairly large kitchen knife (so that it is wider than the garlic clove). Place the flat of the knife on the garlic clove. Strike the flat of the knife with your hand. If you strike hard enough (it may sound strange, but it works really well), you'll be able to remove all the skin from the garlic clove in one go!  Please be carefull not to hurt your beautiful self <3
Schneide die Knoblauchzehen in Hälfte längst, dann kann man die Schale easy abmachen, wie die Rückseite eines Stickers 😊
for an easy and satisfying garlic peel: put the flat side of the knife on a clove and punch it (be careful tho) ... cut off the small top thingy and the garlic should peel in one whole piece without doing much, works everytime :)
How many ML lip filler did u use it looks so good ?
Soup-er thicc😂
i just saw today that you're supposed to soak the garlic in water and then it should easily peel off
Refrigerating the garlic bulbs can sometimes help the skin peel more easily, more in one piece rather than fiddly bits. 😊
crush the garlic with knife to easily peel
THAT ONE NAMJOON MEME 😭😭💧
Sooo?? green look for the Saudi national day?🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦
for the garlic: smash the cloves. like if u press a knife on it the skin will break and u can easily take it off. or u'll cut tue end of the root, this also works pretty well
For peeling garlic you should cut off the butt end (the hard flat end) and then crush the garlic with the wide part of the knife lightly. This will make the peel come off easily.
Namjoonn
i didnt like the look of the egg one make my stomach churn i thought it looked curdled x
Du musst die einzelnen Knoblauchzehen mit der Schale mit der flachen Seite vom Messer runterdrücken und dann in die Brotdose und schütteln
من الاكل الي تاكله واضح ريحتها خايسه
LIKE FR SAW THE UTUBE TUMBNAIL WAS LIKE "OMG NAOMI WHAT IS THAT MAKEUP".love ya
I’ve had bad day and your videos always elevate my mood so thank you Naomi luv u❤😊
naomi's lips look so cartoon-y I LOVE THEM i could never 😭
For the garlic peeling hack you have to remove as much loose peel as you can and then shake it longer than 20 sec, i always use this hack and i shake it until all the peel has come off. For me its the best peeling hack.😄👍
how does naomi not like mac n cheese i feel offended as a raging american college student who eats mac n cheese every day
naomi talking about shin ramen as i’m sitting on my floor at 4:30am making shin ramen
Love this videos foods,are soo funny 😂❤ always enjoy it ❤❤❤
Just take the garlic heads cut an end off put them in tin foil, pour in olive oil cover them cook them then squeeze them out. Easiest way👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
You don’t like Mac & cheese?? You have to have it with bechamel sauce add the cheese baked👏🏻
I flatten garlic with the flat of my knife to remove the skin, it works really well for me 😊
My trick for peeling the garlic is pressing the blade of your knife with your handpalm on the glove and then you can easily peel it!
my ex smelled like garlic, it gave me the ick💀
Highly recommend a silicone garlic peeler!! It's a little silicone tube that you put the garlic in, then roll and they come out peeled, it has truly saved my hands 😙🤌
@naomijon next time wrap the whole garlic bulb not peeled the hole big bulb into tinfoil w olive oil. Put it into a dish and bake then you can squeeze the little garlics right out of its paper, no peeling needed.
Chili in the background just sitting like a people and looking like he is having an existential crisis is SENDING ME!!! 🐈
The text every time she said “bæsl” 😭
POV the guys in the comments "thats not small thats average 🤣
for garlic, cut the ends off, and smash them with the flat of a knife! they basically jump out of their jackets, and it's MUCH easier to peel them.
get your garlic + big knife  place knife on its side on top of garlic, and press down on the knife with your palm this will separate the skin from the garlic clove  (you still have to peel it yourself, but its much much easier) <3333333 :*********
the way Chili is sitting in the back @4:41😂
watching this video while eating ramen omg!!!
lemon will make milk curdle and separate, and that is why sprite is probably used. ---- for garlic, take the clove, and press it against the counter with your palm, the majority of the skin will come off, to all of it will come off. ------
Ramen and Kraft Mac n cheese is brazy
Babe crush the garlic with this method: take a knife and put the side of it on top of the garlic clove. Then take your palm and press down on the side of the knife and use the pressure to crush the garlic a bit. Then the outside skin will peel right off!
Dying with the final countdown background sound😂😂😂😂
hahhahaha! oh nooo im gonna get the farties!! i died
Just chop the ends of the garlic and the peel will just come right off!! :) Love ur vids!
Naomi, better hit that garlic... Hit it with something hard, and it will peel easily..
Wet the garlic cloves. Water helps peel come off easier.
Using pasta water in ANY pasta dish is key it gets thick and makes any sauce stick to the noodles better save a half cup of the pasta water when u drain it.
im not going to add cheese to everything okay guys  adds more parmesan on top
Best way to peel garlic put them in a kitchen towel and roll them the skins should come off perfectly 😁
Not me saving this video for future recipes😅🎉🤌🏾
For the Hwachae, there is a bit of trick there. For what I remember they usually put Chilsung or Sprite from Usa or Asia and I say that because for some reason Sprite in EU is kinda more on the citrus side and less sugary.
The egg drop soup just needed the stock too be hotter and you will get bigger ribbons 😊
In america Sams club sells a giant bag of peeled garlic. Would be perfect for the confit
Why does your cat sit like that 😂😂😂😂😂
Naomi what you need is some baked mac n cheese .
7:12 - 7:19 has me laughing SO MUCH
I'm so used to garlic that I would mind the Alfredo pasta 😂
girl, u can't mix watermelon with milk!!
4:32  I loved the random cat in the back
I watched this whilst eating broccoli 🥦🥦🥦☺️
Tip for peeling the garlic cloves!!! Smash the cloves with a (big) kitchen knife, they’ll peel SO easily! Lots of love from a Dutch broccoli 🥦 ❤
The egg soupe we make it for someone whos sick but adding too much garlic
Taco(or chilli) sitting on his little booty is the best thing ever
the ONE PIECE NOISES LMAOO
❤❤❤ so beautiful and I love her videos
Me watching this video while sick, on my third bowl of egg drop soup
Extra virgin is actually not suited, you can better use other olive oil if you want to heat it longer
Naomi!!! Next time only cut the ends of each clove and crush them with your knife. this way the peel comes off really easy. love from the Netherlands
I LIVE for your ramen videos. PLEASE MORE❤❤
👀
the egg drop soup is literally my childhood food. my mom used to mix an egg with some flour and pour it into the hot soup. love it sm to this day, you should try it, Naomi <3
Tipp für den knoblauch: schneid beiden enden ab und dann press mit einem küchenmesser leicht drauf ohne dass sie komplett zerquetscht nur leicht knackt dann geht's ganz einfach ab 😊 klingt gerade komplizierter als es ist 😂
Your editing makes me laugh so hard, I swear you'll forever be my favorite YouTuber!  I love the fact that we're the same age and you've everything going pretty well for you.
I am a garlic girly so I’d LOVE that pasta 😂 Also, egg drop soup is SO BOMB. I’m glad more people have gotten to know about it because of it “trending” on TikTok. Imo, it’s superior to a chicken noodle or veggie noodle soup for when I’m sick. A lot of times, sickness comes with nausea and the act of chewing makes me feel even more sick. Many other soups are too creamy or sour, so egg drop is perfect.
The egg drop she made is literally mom's go to soup recipe like she literally warms up some broth with corn starch in it and adds minced veggies and chicken and the egg drop ofc it literally tastes so good
I use the flat side of the knife and squish the garlic against the cutting board/counter and it makes it sooooooo much easier to peel!
clown make up
15:48 put garlic in water and let it soake for a minute and than peel it. love youuuu
You could just buy sprite syrup, mix it with "stilles Wasser" and then add it to the fruit bowl thing instead of sparkling sprite
DO NOT MIX LEMON JUICE WITH MILK XD
Easy way to do the garlic, just cut the top of the whole garlic off, don’t bother peeling, pour oil on top and wrap in tin foil. Into the oven for 40 mins 200c and then when cooked you can just squeeze it out!
Easy Pell Garlic- (You will still have to use your hands but its less messy) Get a Paring knife, (about a 3 in sharp knife). Seperate your cloves from the bulb, and cut the cloves tops and bottoms off of each clove. you want to make sure you cut the bottom especially well, and make sure you get that hard part completly off the clove. Hold the knife with your pointer finger on the top of the knife blade (not the sharp part) and place your tumb on the clove, pressing it against the knife blade. make sure to place the blade under the skin of the garlic, and slice inward. This should slide the entire lair of the peel off the clove. from there the rest should practially fall off once you rub it when your finger.
For the first recipe Naomi could have shaked the sprite to reduce the carbonation and it won't be that fizzy
Den Knoblauch rechts und links die „Spitze“ abschneiden und dann ein großes Messer flach drauflegen und dann draufhauen (leicht, damit er nicht zerquetscht wird) und dann geht die Haut ganz easy ab 👌🏼🤗
The lemon could curdle the milk. Maybe?
Ich liebe dich aber hab misophonoe (essgeräuche sind Horror für mich) bitte mach das nicht mehr. Ich werde nicht weiter gucken das killt mich (auch noch über Kopfhörer)😢
Add water next time and let them sit for a few minutes and then shake the garlic and they should be way easier babes ❤.
Queen add a crap ton of garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt, pepper, a variety of cheese, and maybe a little hot sauce to your cheese sauce for Mac n cheese. That's how my family makes it and we're told we over season everything.
Do NOT put lemon juice in dairy milk! It will curdle
OMag THANkS FOR DOING MY FAV VLOG
Naomi you needed to add milk to that Mac n cheese 🥲
The Mac and cheese was supposed to be the individual microwave mac & cheese package because the cheese is more mild and the noodles end up with more liquid
The best way to peel garlic is actually to do this:   Separate it down to the individual clove, then set it on a solid surface. Like on the countertop other a wooden cutting board. Take a large, chopping knife and lay ***ONE FLAT SIDE*** over a single clove and firmly hit ***THE OTHER FLAT SIDE*** with your palm. Do not chop it with the blade part of the knife, and only hit it hard enough to break off the skin. You do not want to crush the garlic or it will change its flavor.   Some people familiar with "Mythical Kitchen" have probably seen Josh palm heel strike garlic a lot, it's similar to that but his garlic is already peeled so he's just crushing it to cook it. But I don't know if you can get pre-peeled garlic in Germany.   Other method you can do if you're going to be cooking a whole head of garlic is this:   Cut off the top of the head with a sharp knife to expose all the cloves but leave the skin on. Wrap it in tinfoil but leave the cut part exposed so you can drizzle oil inside. Once the oil has been drizzled onto the cloves, close the tinfoil ball and bake it. You can then just squeeze the cloves out of the head with tongs.   Also when you make garlic confit with whole cloves you can keep it in the refrigerator for as long as 2 months as long as your store it properly. To store garlic confit:   Make sure you keep it in a glass jar with an airtight lid. After you finish baking it, let it come down to room temperature before refrigerating it. Let it sit on the counter in the jar until it stops steaming, then cover it loosely until it's room temperature. Once it's room temperature it can be covered fully and kept in the fridge for up to 2 months.
wont putting lemon in milk curdle it?
For the garlic just try to press on it with the flat side of your knife until you hear a little crack, then cut off the sides of the garlic and it should peel off a lot easier😊
hab jetzt schon mehrfach gehört, dass europäischer knoblauch schärfer/ intensiver is, als anderswo, also nächstes mal vielleicht weniger verwenden bei Rezepten aus Amerika und co 😅
Chili at the beginning in the background overthinking all of his decisions 😭😭😂
@naomijon Angeblich soll heißes Wasser beim Knoblauch Schälen helfen, aber ich schätze es ist besser davor den unteren kleinen Part abzuschneiden (also da wo die Zehe vorher in der Knolle fest war, weiß nicht wie man das nennt) 😅☺️
watching this while eating ramen😌
Instead of using that garbage strawberry milk that wasnt even pink what you needed to do is to add some chopped or crushed strawberries, it would have made the milk to be actually pink.
You cannot squeeze the lemon or lime in there with the strawberry milk you'll curdle it
de cecco pasta i love u naomi
I recently learned that carbonation is acidic. So when you mix milk and soda, you’re very close to making spoiled milk.
Hey Naomi! A tip to make peeling garlic easier: separate the pieces of garlic so they won't stick together then put them in a bowl and pour hot water over them and let them soak for 1 min,not longer cuse they'll lose the flavor. This way it will peel much much faster. Hope it will help you! Love your videos ❤
I think the combo of the sprite with the strawberry milk created some weird reaction. Doesn't carbon make milk taste spoiled? I have heard about it, so maybe that's what caused the bitterness. Also Citrus and Milk, yeah no don't do that.
girlie watching you is inspiring me to start learning German again. I'm downloading duolingo 😂
omg the NANA music in between 😭
Lifehack: when you want your noodles in egg soup to be thick - add a bit flour to the eggs. It will make the mixture more dense and noodles will be thicker. And always make sure the broth is boiling when u pour the eggs
Hiii ❤❤❤❤
where can i buy this amazing strawberry bedding set? 😻
You smash the garlic and the skin comes right off.
Offtopic, but the immaculate lipstick after eating moist food is giving me life! Naomi please drop the lip combo 😭💖
You look so much like my niece, your facial expressions, your gait are amazing, you begin to believe in the transmigration of souls. She is a very smart girl, but you are not a fool either.
Love the One Piece sounds😭
NAOMI PLEASE TRU COSPLAYING ANIME CHARACTERS
The egg drop soup: soup shouldn't boil anymore and stir slowly
Fellow german here. I was lucky to first taste mac and cheese from a close american friend, that has similar tastes to me. If you know what cheese to use and make it from scratch, bomb
I found a naomijon trollvideo,,, and boy I tell you 🤣🤣🤣
The first recipe looks like something I would make as a kid for my mom thinking I did something 😭😭😂
4+4=
The egg soup is the soup that my mum always used to make me and I tho it was chicken and she never corrected me haha it is my fav
NAOMI PLEASE CRUSH YOUR GARLIC CLOVES WITH KNIFE BEFORE YOU PEEL THEM.... ITS SO MUCH EASIER, AND I DONT KNOW HOW ARE YOU NOR VINCENT NOT KNOW THAT.
About the eggdrop soup, u better not put water with the eggs so it will not look like yours and look more fluffy and thick
Tour vlog???
Knoblauch den strunk abschneiden und die zehe etwas mit der hand auf das brett drücken. Dann schält sie sich fast von alleine
Basically, Actually and Literally 😂😂😂😂😂 omg Naomi....staaaaph
i LOVE ramen, especially Shin Ramyun, so pleaasssee make many more videos about it!
the asian way would be, the garlic cloves then with the knife lay flat on it then smash it with your hand :> works every time
PUT THE GARLIC into a microwave for like 10 seconds it comes off so easily !!!
8:35 we usually do this here in italy with “pastina”! or at least I do. when it’s really cold outside and i’m too lazy to cook :D one lf my fav comfort food
Hi 👋🏻 wenn Du etwas Mehl in die Eier machst, wird das Ei etwas dicker
"I'm not going to add anymore cheese".  *PROCEEDS TO ADD CHEESE*  🤣🤣🤣
carbonic acid and milk = instant spoiled milk
It's because carbonation makes milk sour/expire.   🤣🤣🤣
I think I can taste that garlic through the screen 😬
For the strawberry milk recipe, please dont try that with lemon as the milk will get spoilt and even separate to become cheese 🤮
Kannst du mal ein Video auf deutsch machen?
I like garlic sooooooo much I don’t understand why people say garlic smell bad 🙁
6:38 THATS WHAT GOOD P* SOUNDS LIKE
« seasoning my food with water » that’s also a weird food hack 😂
10:33 😂 no but same
noo u didn’t add all the pasta 🫢
I love egg drop soup with lotsa green onions and coriander leaves 😂
I love how the summer in germany never ends lmao i know it's off topic but it will be warm till sthe start of october hahahahah
that namjoon clip jumpscared me lol. anyways i love your makeup hereeee! im craving for ramen but here it's getting pricey those instant ramen noodles T_T
You can buy peeled garlic in pots
It's because in the Mac and cheese you're supposed to ADD MILK TOO!!
im just so impressed by how her lip combo stays on after all that shi she be eating😭😭😭love you naomi!!
The first one... idk about the sprite
Namjoon Yeah 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Please, please do not put lemon juice in your strawberry milk. 😞 🤢
Sorry, I love your vibes or like colors it gives off Aku, but makeup style🤌✨🔥
Naomi u should make seblak, I think u will be like it hehe
The best trick that’s worked for me with garlic is laying ur knife blade flat on top of the garlic and then smackin it hard down on the piece of garlic and the shell slides right off
wholesome content
Use a garlic roller it helps so much
best way to peel a lot of garlic cloves is to buy them already peeled LOL
The egg drop soup needs to be hot hot when you pour in the egg so it cooks instantly and doesnt dissolve into the broth! Also a small slow pour is best
Whyd she leave the milk out of the mac and cheeeeee
✨✨💯
I put my garlic cloves in a jar, add boiling water. Let sit about a minute, dump/rinse. You still have to peel them, but makes it way easier. I usually chop off the butt and put a slit in the side and they pop right out
baby girl you could just have added more water an also less mac n cheese powder :3, ill try it bc it looks yummy!
Seasoning food with water is just about the most German thing I’ve seen you do 😂
the egg drop soup was my childhood!
I add a small bit of milk to my Mac n cheese to incorporate the powders
@naomijon Try stirring only in one direction gently with the egg drop soup to get better ribbons
i'm a garlic fiend so that last one would be amazing for me
NAOMI PLEASE I WANT MORE SHIN RAMEN RECIPES
Omg pls stop using metal utensils with your pans thats how you poison yourself 😭😭❤
THE RANDOM NAMJOON MEME TOOK ME TF OUT BAHAHAH
YAYA SHE ADDED SOMEONE KOREANN LIKE MEE
Please noamie don't mix lemon with milk. It not a good idea.
In Spain and Italy we hit the garlic with the flat part of the knife, only one good hit, pushed the flat part and you have the garlic naked :B
Maybe just a tad overly ❤
7:44 looking at this low key made my stomach hurt BUT I want to try so bad
Press down/crush garlic with the flat edge of a knife on a flat surface and the skin will peel off a lot easier 💕
To peel garlic I either crush it with a knife, or cut off the root end and the skin comes with it
I don't taste my food while I'm cooking because I don't want to spoil the surprise 😂😂😂😂😂😂
best trick to quickly peal galic: put the seperate pieces into the microwave for aproximately 5 sec. They'll just pop out (if it doesn't work immediately, do it again for another 5 sec)
For ur egg drop soup: have ur soup base come to a bubbling boil and then calm down/cool down the soup slightly by turning down the heat till the base is barely bubbling. Higher Temperature will cook the egg faster, make them more chunky/fluffy/ribbon like, and soup is more clear! You got This Naomi!!
egg drop soup is super popular but im from hawaii.
You should try ensalada de fruta con crema 😋
I absolutely wanna try the egg drop soup I love egg drop soup so much
Naomi I’m taking German this semester!!
I NEED MOORE RAMEN VIDEOS
In Pakistan when it’s hot we mix milk with sprite/7up. Very refreshing!
Put all od the garlic into water, the skin gets wet and fall off (from Spain sorry for my english..) ❤
Respectfully, you need to try some oven baked mac and cheese from the Southern US and then you'll get it
idk if it's been said yet but smash the garlic with the palm of your hand and the coat will slide off. If it's too hard smash it down with the flat side of a large knife.
Garlic trick tip! Get a cup of boiling water and place the garlic in, soak for 30 seconds and then take out. Peel with ease, works every time! 💜
I love watching these videos while eating Instant Ramen 😁 Bitte weiter so!
For a garlic peel trick which works for me every time: I cut of both ends like a tiny bit. When cutting the second end I can easily peel of the skin with the knife
Crush the garlic cloves with the side of the knife and the skin peels off easily
I think they have a silicon tube you roll garlic in and helps peel it?? I've never used it but it's there lol
liebe die one piece sounds 😂😍
as a shin ramen addict i hope you never stop with the hacks
Seeing your "Rote Grütze" as a woman from northern germany makes me wanna cry...
17:49  FINITO 🗣️🇮🇹
the way ur cat be posted up in the bg kills me
"Egg drop soup" heißt bei uns Eierflockensuppe. Meine Oma ist 75 und macht die schon seit ich denken kann für uns Kinder wenn wir krank sind, oder auch so zwischendurch. 🥰🫶 Liebe an alle Omiiiiis 🫶
6:26 the offline clip lmaofjekehejj 😭
Hwachae is just like the mexican agua de frutas minus the soda
Du musst die Knoblauchzehen mit deinen Fingern hin und her quetschen. Wenn du die Zehen zusammendrückst und dabei zwischen deinen Fingern rollst, löst sich die Haut und du kannst sie richtig gut abziehen ☺️ Funktioniert jedes Mal und macht ehrlich gesagt auch echt Spaß lol
6:54 I'M SCREAMINGGGGGG
i started watching one piece a few weeks ago and its all i talk and think about now  and idk if I'm tripping rn, but she added sounds from op ???
Anyone else use milk in their kraft mac&cheese along with the butter?
goodluck with getting the spicy noodles out of your system <333
Says isn’t going to add cheese to everything… puts parmesan in the Alfredo
me watching you eat hwachae while eating pineapple
You legit made sprilk w fruit lol
i forgot twt changed its name to x and i thought u meant a porn site for a split second-
If you turn down the heat for the broth for the egg drop soup right before you drop in the egg and slowly stir, your ribbons will be larger.
i feel for you, that you never had properly seasoned mac and cheese.....
K so my dad (who's Chinese) taught me how to make egg drop soup. You need to bring the soup to a boil, or at the very least to a simmer, then you stir it fast until it creates a spiral (?) basically until it keeps doing the motion itself and then you STOP stirring and slowly pour the egg into the moving soup. That's how my dad makes it traditionally and it looks perfect everytime :)
I need Naomi to drop a makeup tutorial ASAP😭
The Alfredo one looks perfect for a first date, it is just the perfect dish 👌
Try cutting the ends of the cloves before shaking 😊
as a chinese girlie, im so happy to see naomi try egg drop soup. i always had that and congee when i was sick as a kid
is it just me but every time when Naomi does food related videos it makes you hungry and you start craving food?? -------- No is it just me??  cause tell me why i get super hungry while watching and I'm all craving ramen 😭😭
Don't put lemon in with milk, for the first dessert. It will curdle 😅
There’s a punch that a lot of people make in the US for baby showers where you use ice cream or sherbet and sprite and it’s so good. I feel like this first recipe should have used strawberry ice cream.
No hate but you are wasting so much food but I like that😊
6:13 She meant “DON’T use extra virgin olive oil” because that’s not suitable for heating, the more refined an oil is, the more suitable it is for heating (the higher the smoke point is). Simply: use regular olive oil, it’s more refined and won’t smoke so easily.  *** I’m assuming she meant “don’t”because it looks like she used regular olive oil, due to the very light color it had within the bottle of oil she was using. It looks like she knew what she was doing here! She just said the wrong thing accidentally, which is an easy mistake!
little garlic hack I do is I place the garlic clove on the cutting board then I get my knife and flip it to its side and then place that flat on top of the garlic then give it a smash, and that should make it easier to peel (I hope lol)
Hey , love from India ❤️I really wanted to see you doing 24 hours eating Indian food❤️

Loving the detective conan soundtracks
Yoo rm what are u doing here bro
naomi... don't ever stop showing us all the ramen hacks. i'm literally living for your shin ramyun videos <3
Hallo queeeen
I think you forgot the milk for the mac n cheese!
maybe putting lemon in the fruit soup thingy is not the best idea, because the strawberry milk could react weirdly to the acid idk
When my mom made me noodle soup when I was young she always dropped a egg in it :) I Love it
I love confit garlic 🤤
Sooo much sesame oil
i cannot get enough of these videos
For egg drop soup, stir slower and pour it slower x.
Yooo we have to hit these 3 million guyyyys❤ everyone bring someone new to subscribe like rn
Bei careful with garlic, it can low your bloodpressure :D
Not X 😭😭😭
the bassle pieces look like zaza
I needed the word ,,lunch“ in my class exam today (German here👺) and I just couldn’t seem to find it In my stupid ass brain🥹🥹 So mad right now
The garlic trick, you need to cut the bottom of the bulb off. That is where it is attached strongest
If you put garlic in the oven, you don’t need to peel them. Just cut the top off, put some oil on it and when the Gaelic is done you can just squeeze it out :)
3:30. Add condensed milk 😋😋😋😋
Does someone know where Neomi got her bed sheets from? They are so cute❤
Not the mac and cheese slanderrrrr
that was actually the best video for me to watch today ❤ my stomach has been really upset so i made the egg drop soup and it helped a lot...the egg was just bland so i might season the egg itself next time too
4:41 CHILI RETHINKING LIFE IN THE BACKGROUND IM DEAD💀
Sorry im late ❤❤😔
If you can put every single Shim Ramen noodle hack that you’ve tried in one vidoe.. girl, I’ll love you more than Vincent 👀
Soak the garlic in water for 15 min. It will be easy to peel them
you should try making different mac n cheese recipes😃you might like southern american mac better
this is my comfort YouTube channel, it's just perfect  Naomi come to Brazil 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷 love ya 💕
i just realized Naomi's hair is giving NCT!
God smash garlic with knife but (still gently) from both sides and it will peel easy
Die Suppe muss mehr kochen wenn du das Ei reinkippst 🙈
Wenn du beim Knoblauch oben und unten ein bisschen was abschneidest, geht die Schale super einfach ab. 👌🏼
Is it just me or her makeup is really getting weirder and impractical ,which somehow is making her look so fake?😢
Naomi looks amazing with this hair cut, it suits her so well
as much as i love you, and your makeup (every new video you slay your makeup looks, especially your eyeliner, it’s 💋🤌🏻 **chef’s kiss**) but i admit- i couldn’t stop staring at the red eyeliner between your eyebrows, dw it’s probably just your beauty hehhehe ANYWAYS i love you SO FREAKIN MUCH and I’m so disappointed i didn’t run into you because i was in Berlin from 27 november 2022 to- 1st of december 2022 💗🫵🏻😭💋🤌🏻 P.S. sorry for the ESSAY long comment hehehehe 🖐🏻😔💅🏻💋 yours truly, a random and a VERY annoying broccoli 🥦
Omg the famous drag queen box edmacandcheese  😍
gurl.. you soak the garlic in water for 15 minutes and then you use a small knife to aid you in peeling the garlic off.. goddamn
Instead of chicken noodle, my mom would make me egg drop soup, and I swear it really helps you feel better.
all i could think of was sprite and bananas in the first one
ON THE ROAD TO 3 MILLL🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
For the ramen, I would HIGHLY recommend using whole milk to dilute the mac-n-cheese powder! (if you can)  That would also make the shin powder less spicey! <3
I have a "Ramen" recipe that you might like to try. It’s also like a mixture of Ramen and Mac and Cheese but more likeable imo. I actually est this quite often. It’s more like a broke student meal. Normally I use the chicken YumYum ramen. I cook the noodles. Without the oil or spices. During that I’m cutting a red paprika and some cherry tomatoes. And fry them in a pan with the oil that came with the ramen. I add some regular spices like Garlic Powder, Salt, Pepper and Paprika Powder. Than I add some cooking cream. Or unwhipped whipping cream. 200g on 2 packages of the ramen. To the cream and vegetables mixture I’m adding the ramen spices. And give it a good stir. After that I’m adding the noodles and stir again to cover them with the sauce. And lastly I’m adding shredded cheese. I use the whole package because I’m lactose intolerant and I couldn’t care less about it. Let it melt and mix everything together. And ready is the meal. As I said it’s more like a broke student meal. I just used things I had at home. And it came out really good for me.
Oh I was so worried…when i saw the can of sprite bc isn’t banana and sprite supposed to make you vomit? 😂
Why am I always watching your vids when im hungry!😂
the garlic box shake should be in a glass container bc it’s harder!
bäsl
i literally make ramen w eggs like egg drop soup w SOY SAUCE & SESAME SEEDS ONTOP OMFG
She consumed around 10,000 mg of sodium in this videos s_s
Me watching the first hack and remembering the myth that drinking sprite and eating bananas makes you throw up: 😶
when you said "im severely dehydrated" i instantly knew what you were goona do
crush the garlic with flat side of a knife, then it comes off really easy
1:52 omg namjoon 😭😭😭
lane ciasto
For the garlic, use a glass jar instead of plastic containers. It takes a lot of shaking to get that layer off of the garlic
I neeeeeeeeeeed more of this ramen videos, Naomi. I'm a ramen bitch
u eating with the lipgloss gives me anxiety 😩😩
Baby you need to come to the states and get some homemade mac n chz down south is where all the flavor is.
i take the flat of a chef knife, and lay it on a clove of garlic, then smack the other side of the knife. this smashes the garlic, and the peel comes off much easier
Someone please make Naomi some homemade southern style Mac n cheese!!!!
you should crush the garlic cloves ! with  a lot of aggression
1. For the ribbon eggs, heat the water until boiling, and turn the heat real low or turn off, pour the egg and wisk one or twice( not strongly) and let the eggs cook to form the ribbons.  2. For the garlics use a metal bowl with a metal lid or a pot with a metal lid and shake it very hard ( it's gonna be super loud) but it does the job.  Hope this helps :) ❤
put the garlic in the microwave for like 10s and it'll de pelled
Miss ma’am mama come to my house and ima make you fall in love with mac. My homemade is so flavorful. I used to feel just like you till I started making my own. I’d send you some but idk if it would make it still eatable lol
Du kannst mit einem normalen Messer in die Knolle in die einzelnen Zehen raus ziehen oder einzelne Zehen lösen und dann ein großes Messer schräg drauf legen und die Zehe „knacken“ und dann ist es quasi schon geschält
My best garlic hack: get the Chinese garlic! It’s the same taste but they are the shape of tiny onions and not cloves, so you peel them A LOT quicker. Everyone I told about that garlic is now using it! You can get them in normal supermarkets, too! We always buy them in Netto or Rewe
The queen is backk, we missed youu ❤❤❤
As someone who grew up with Italians and am Italian myself… The best way to peel garlic is to crush it with the side of ur knife gently, the skin will be loose afterwards. Thats the best way my family/ I know and thats the way we use every time. 🥰
die haben im Video in Öl eingelegten Knoblauch genommen, der ist auch weniger intensiv im Geschmack
The first fruit dessert you made reminds of the fruit salad they sell here in streets in the Philippines. It's basically just the similar mixture of fruits with condensed milk, evaporated milk, water and some ice and it tastes so good and refreshing. To make it pink, you just need to smash the some of the watermelon slices so that it will mix with the liquid and it'll turn pinkkkk. Plus it's not fizzy too, just sweet, milky and watermelony if that makes sense
Garlic pealing tip! I know your frustrations I had this problem but learnt a great tip years ago to crush each piece of garlic with knife then the skin is loose to pull right off!!! Hope this helps :)
6:58 tHIS MOUTH IS ON FIREEEEEE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
You don't add a splash of milk to your mac n cheese? 😮
smash the clove of garlic with the flat side of the knife. It makes it so  much easier to peel.   xoxo luv u
Coconut water from a fresh coconut would have been tastier
for the egg drop soup, i’ve had to learn the hard way that “stir in the egg slowly” doesn’t mean to pour slowly, but rather to stir slowly and pour at a normal rate. you can even let the egg it sit for just a moment (not too long) to let it become Chonky and prevent it turning into little egg threads
Omg Naomi. Try the eggdrop with shin ramyun. I always eat it like that it’s the best 🤌🏼
"I'm not gonna add cheese"  2 seconds later: Adds parmesan cheese 😂
I love you girl! Perfection personality, perfection makeup, perfection voice, perfection hair, perfection everything!
Lass das Wasser beim Ei weg, dann hast du dickere “Streifen”❤
Hit the garlic with a knife
Try Putting the garlic in warm water for a few seconds before pealing it that makes it a lot easier ❤
I feel the same way about Mac & cheese
es gibt solo knoblauch. das ist eigentlich eine ganze knolle und man muss nicht so viel pulen UND er gibt dir nicht so harten mundgeruch nach knoblauch
Ummmm... if you cut the weird little part on the bottom of the garlic, you can remove the whole garlic skin (?) by just grabbing the top (spitze). Then you have all of the garlic skin in one piece in your hand :)
5:39 put some msg and jalapeños, meyybe you'll like it better 😅 chicken broth soup with egg drop is donne here often
Pre peeled garlic left the chat 😂
15:43 Just press the garlic with the knife (flat part) but yeah you still need to use your hand but easier I my opinion.... I hope this help im sorry if not.. 👁️👄👁️
The random namjoon meme
Your make up reminds me of Mephisto from the Rockopera Faust.
You can buy peeled garlic in asian stores
im watching from Saudi Arabia and it’s a freaking oven!🙂💔 so yeah…
Naomi: mac and cheese Me: MAC AND CHEESE 👹
If you want thicker egg ribbons in your soup, don't dilute your egg, and stir slightly slower.
Watching Naomi with my Lithuanian boyfriend to improve his German  >>> Idk it just works
Hear me out.... Bald Naomi. I feel like it would be a slay
Knoblauch schälen: Enden abschneiden, mit der flachen Seite des Messers darauf drücken und die Schalen gehen wie von selbst ab.
When you need to peel a lot of garlic let them sit in water like 15-30 minutes they will peel faster and easier.
Please, please please! DO NOT MIX MILK WITH LEMON! Or any citrus fruit!  You'll be so sick. It makes the milk go bad! Lmao
For the garlic just smash it with a hammer or something strong then it'll be way easier to pull the skin off. I got taught this method by my mom 😅
It's easier to peel garlic when you squish it a little with the flat side of your knife
u r sooo pretty i love u
I feel so VIP being able to understand what naomi says in german
girl i wonder how hard you'll shit tomorrow😂❣
chili at 4:48 is a whole mood
Für den 16:00 Knoblauch: drück mit deinem Handballen auf die Knoblauchzehe (kann auch schnell zerbrechen also etwas vorsichtig) aber wenn es dann geknackt hat dann geht die Schale mega easy ab ✨
GARLIC PEEL HACK: you just can squeze a garlic with the sides of the knife and it will come off so mucg easier 🧄
Push down on garlic with a flat knife, dont fully crunch it, but it breaks the shell and its easier to pull off
i love u
The fact that the red lipstick stayed throughout the video is insane! What is it girl😂
The first dessert is similar to a fruit cocktail drink served in my country. We used ice cream soda instead of sprite
naomi my love i hate to break it to you but the korean water is actually un agua de frutas de la michoacana
Garlic tip: pop them in the microwave for 10 seconds. The skins will slip right off! ❤🧄
The video starts in the first minute of the video?!? damn
omggg we have the same bed sheets
you should try australian foods and candys/lollies i reckon you'll like it
=)
Soak the garlic cloves in water and leave them overnight, the next day the skin just peels off so easily
Die Suppe war zu kalt für das Ei ✨🙂
crush the garlic with your knife and the peel will come off more easily
You can try to pick out the gralic with a fork or a knife
✨for some reason✨ hahahaha omg zu gut😂
egg soup is typical soup in Croatia, when you are ill or have a stomach problem.  :D
Best way to peel garlic Smash the clove with flat side of knife using the bottom of palm  It should crack and loosen the skin of clove and peels right off
the first dish looks like my trashbin fruits milk and sprite
Now I am hungry and wanna try those garlicky garlic pasta
i love you
Girllll you gotta SMASH that garlic it then peels super easily
4:41 bro why is Chili just staring off into space like that
Stop deleting my Comment
i did NOT expect a namjoon meme but 😭😭😭😭💜
tiktok trend QUEENNNNNN <3
I'm not a ramen fan at all, and I really want to be, maybe I haven't tasted the best ones or something😂
Do not put lemon in there... Its gonna become cheese
For garlic (Italian here ofc) some ways to peel that make it easier, getting the specific piece you want and then slamming a chef knife or some form of knife you are cutting it with on to it (like knife on garlic and hit down on it with palm) which will loosen the skin up, another way, this is ofc if I remember correctly (I do the first one more than this) is to put boiling water I believe over it and then shake or some form of that, I'd look on tiktok for garlic hacks but the first one is the one I use and a lot of my family use. I hope this helps!
Anyone know the piano song at 7:15? I love it, she has used it in one of her other videos as well.
ist nicht nudelsuppe/maultaschensuppe mit ei voll das deutsche ding haha
if u enjoyed hwachae you should try sago fruit bowls**!!! its delicious
I hate melon too… that fart flavor definitely transfers over 😅
VAMPIRES HATE HER !! : Her garlic pasta video goes viral.
Girl you're one of the few other people I've heard that loves cheese, yet dislikes Mac n cheese lol I'm the same way. It's just such a textural issue so I have to have it baked.  cheese pulls are always superior tho😂
I cook my garlic first then I peel them. It’s way easier to peel from the bottom too
omg danke endlich jemand der Wassermelone auch nicht gerne mag
Put your garlic in water for 5 min that peel them it will be a lot more easier❤
Squash each garlic piece with the knife flat side and then it’s easy to peel, otherwise cut the garlic top off and throw the whole garlic in the Ofen with olive oil on top and bake it, let it cool and you can squeeze the garlic out 👍🏻
She looks insane, not in a good way.
just peel the garlic when its outa the oven its much easier!
Ich hab so viel Hwachae gegessen diesen Sommer! I love it! (My boyfriend hates it)
Naomi und ihre neue Liebe für Udon Nudeln erfüllt mein Herz mit Freude <3 <3 <3
i need ramen
The strawberry bedding tho 🙌🍓💗
Use ice cream soda for better taste!!
Its not on tiktok because Ive been gatekeeping my moms home recipe but PLS TRY TUNA CASSEROLE. I'LL LITERALLY SEND YOU THE RECIPE IF YOU'RE DOWN TO TRY IT😭😭
If you stirr the soup slower, they turn more into ribbons. TBH its kinda hard LOL
hre videos on 2x sound like the ads on the animal crossing new horizon radio
I want someone to make out with me with the same intensity you make out with custard
lip combo pls?! 😖
I´m always so shocked that Naomi finds the shin ramen spicy, I just tried it last week hoping my mouth to be on fire but... it was so mild lmao.  Maybe the fact I´m in a mexican household built my spiciness endurance
i feel like my stomach will be upset after this egg soup
im italian and that broth and egg soup thingy its called "stracciatella d'uovo" here (at least my mom calls it like that), im not sure it is the original name tho
You can soak the garlic in water for 10 mins and then the peel comes of easily
Try cooking whatever noodle you want and when it boils and you put your flavour in then just crack a egg right on the soup and let it cook with the noodles and it makes a poached egg
theres a new silicone tube you roll garlic in that I saw in a video online. They sell for 2-20 canadian dollars so try to find one for a euro because some resellers are ripping people off. It came up when I googled silicone garlic peeler
17:49 “ FINITO !” my italian ass’s so proud of you
Smash the garlic with a knife before peeling
for the garlic 15:47, try crushed it first with the flat side of the knife then peel it as u normally do
for the fruit salad thing. DO NOOOOT USE LEMON, IT WILL CURDLE THE MILK
The first fruit bowl in the video, in Indonesia there are similar fruit bowl like that, but instead sprite we used coconut syrup and water also ice and many fruits its called es buah
When your sauce is too "soupy" just add some cornflour to thicken up :)
lemon will curdle strawberry milk just fyi. I love your demon summoning makeup
me too whenever i eat mac n cheese taste nothing, just some pasta with weird coating 😊
I'm sure a million other people have said this... but adding straight lemon juice with curdle your milk... that's how you make cheese haha.
du musst die Wurzel unten abschneiden und dann die einzelnen Knoblauchzehen von oben anschneiden, dann kannst du sie einfach rausziehen aus der schale 🙃
iv'e missed you queen
The fruit bowl I like to have (I'm from Indonesia) consists of watermelon, apple, pear, melon, coconut jelly, young coconut flesh, dragon fruit (to get the pink color), some ice, simple syrup, and condensed milk.   Better if use flaky ice/shaved ice.
when I was a baby I refused to drink breast milk & for some reason they started feeding me egg drop soup instead ... even now when I smell it, I get nostalgic, but I despise eggs so i ain't eating that anymore
I can't unsee you saying you're not going to add cheese on anything more and then the next slide : *sprinkles cheese into the fettuccine*💚😋😂
You were so close with the garlic peeling! Just has to be a hard bowl and lid, not soft plastic. It also helps if it's on the larger side so the garlic bits have a chance to pick up some speed when you shake it. I usually use a soup pot, clamp the lid with both hands and shake as hard as I can for like 10 seconds. You should be left with mostly peeled garlic every time.
With garlic I like to take each piece and cut the tip of the top and bottom, then slightly smash it with my knife and the "shell" part comes right off xD .... .
BETTER NOT BE THE LAST!! REMEMBER......your FANS will....and DO, rewatch your videos so it does not matter your content (for me anyways, and others feel the same way too I'm sure) duplicate everything and we WILL BE HERE NAOMI!!!!❤
THROW SOME RUM IN THERE AND YOU GOT A PARTY!!!
Egg drop soup is amazing I used to eat ut all the time now I can't eat as much because I don't eat eggs like I used to cause the taste but it's amazing
If Naomi opened a restaurant I'd go there everyday.
Im from Australia, and I feel the same with 'instant' Mac and cheese, until recently. A new one came out called The Big Cheese XL Mac and Cheese, and it's the only 'instant' M&S I actually like. It comes in a microwave container, which is white and red with yellow writing. It's just a little big for me in one sitting 😅 great for splitting with someone or having as a side dish.
Hint: DON'T squeeze a lemon into the first one, acidity of lemon juice will curdle your strawberry milk xD
I’m a homemade Mac and cheese pro and let me tell you it has *flavorrrr* 🤗
Says "I'm not going to add cheese" adds cheese 😅😅😅😂
Garlic Peeling! Cut the ends off each clove and then smush it with the flat of a (big) knife. You don't have to completely crush it to make the peels way easier to take off 👍
Bro as someone who dislikes the stretchy and texture of cheese, Mac and cheese sauce is one of my favorite "cheese" in the world.
for the egg drop soup, the eggs shouldn't be beaten too much, just stir a bit and then pour it in while stirring the broth as naomi did. then you'll get the stringy texture
Naomi, If you ever get the chance try Mi goreng (indo-mie) two ways. First do it plain (so cooked dry - aka no broth - noodle with the packets) and then do it where you add an egg and cheese. I just push the cooked/ strained noodles over and turn down the head. I crack an egg on the bottom of the pot where the noodles arnt. Then slowly let it cook, using a chop stick to stir it as the bottom cook so that all the liquid is solidified. It makes the egg super fluffy so when you stir it into the noodles you know its fully cook and it gives it this thick coating. Idk how to explain it but its so good. Then add cheese for flavor. Just know it will also thicken it as its a dry noodle.  It also helps with the bit of spice that the noodles have from the chili paste. Its not too hot but it does bite.
I am living for the one piece sound affects ❤
LOL - Naomi didn't add any milk to the mac & cheese, it's what cuts it down from being dry and makes it more creamy.  Read the instructions girl haha
The egg drop soup needed to be a lot hotter so it can cook the egg as soon as it touched the soup. Because the soup was not hot enough, the egg mixed with the liquid and it didn’t come out in such big fluffy flakes
Don't put lemon with the milk it will curdle! Maybe try a sport drink like gatorade?
9:52  Damit das Ei in der Suppe so aussieht wie im Video, mach ich es immer so: 1. Topf von der Platte nehmen.  2. Ei ohne rühren hinzugeben. 3. Alles drin? Jetzt rühren. Vielleicht hilft es ja, LG❤
my sister made spicy noodles & couldn't finish it so I added it to my KD it waz really good
Naomi the egg will be thicker ribbons if you SLOW stir, you were stirring like a maniac XD
if u get the samyang noodles with that chicken character on it, those are actually referred to as Buldak noodles. it literally translates to "fire chicken" so ANY time you see that chicken, it's gonna be spicy as hell
The strawberry bed 🥰🍓
Put a piece of garlic under a knife a hit it down or press hard, and it will split making it easier to peel.
Omg the naruto music ... you're gonna make me rewatch the whole show again 🥲🫶🏼
Naomi: stir it slowly 🥰 Also naomi: *stirring like her life depends on i* Naomi again: *confused and sad why her wgg is tiny and thing as if she didn't stir it like she was beating some cake mix*
Gotta try a Mexican American Mac and cheese recipe NOTHING like it
18:06 MONKEY ISLAND GUUUUYYYSSSS
i thought the fruit drink exists in every part of the world, i guess it's just an asian thing cute make up as always 😍
7:00 Probably cos the shin ramen are usualllyyyyy like soupy. So with the powder itself it’ll be less watery than it usually is. I think.
you need to put dragonfruit to make it pink
What I do to easily peel garlic is I first separate the cloves, put the side of a knife (NOT sharp blade facing up) on top of it, and use the heel of my hand to smash it. This will make removing the peels so much easier. In my experience, it doesnt matter if the garlic cloves stay whole for most dishes anyway
NAMJOON WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
you have to add milk to the powder
I never get tired of these videos. I eat ramen with you while I’m watching lol
What is this lippp combooo ?😍😍
I don’t know if your Mac and cheese is different than in america, but in the US, you add milk to the Mac and cheese with the butter and cheese powder.
for the egg drop soup, i’ve had to learn the hard way that “stir in the egg slowly” doesn’t mean to pour slowly, but rather to stir slowly and pour at a normal rate. you can even let the egg sit for just a moment (not too long) to let it become Chonky and prevent it turning into little egg threads
OMG!What hell did I fall into😂The elders in my culture mix milk and sprite too. I always thought they were weird and refused to even taste it. Is this a thing in other cultures too?
For the egg drop soup（蛋花湯）, it’s best to make the soup boil then pour the egg. At least that’s how I make it 😂
I loved egg drop soup growing up but never thought to make it. Will do that soon
I fully understand not liking cantaloupe or honeydew or musk melon, but *watermelon,* Vincent?! Sure, it might not be my favorite thing ever, but how does one actively and strongly dislike watermelon?🤷‍♀️
So I have to peel 30+ cloves of garlic every summer for a large batch of tomato sauce that I keep for the next year, and honestly the best tip is just to cut the end off with the brown spot, and just smash it (lightly) once with the side of your knife. It loosens the skin from the garlic and 9/10 times it'll slide right off after that.
i hope you dont add lemon or lime to your milk, It would actually cause it to curdle :(
use a jar for the garlic because it is harder than the plastic and shake it hard
The Mac n’ cheese came out to play after such an accusation
Oh my goodness. You gotta try the thai/lao dessert thats similar to the first dish. It has jellies and fruits like lychee and uses coconut milk. Nam van. There's different recipes and i remember my sister in law use to make a pink version.
Wow I’m a little early
the butts needs to get ouuut and then skae it iiin
Smash the garlic with the flat side of your knife. It will immediately come out of its peel and it will be easier to mince. Be careful.
We would have used Pineapple oranges Rasspberry's Orwhatever fruits you have in your house at the time Honestly LOL The key is Raspberry sherbet ginger ale and raspberry jello or strawberry jello I leave the Jello out but mix it with the fruit and then drink it LOL I like it best after The Sherbet melts a little bit because that is when the flavors get mixed together better LOL Brings back memories and I can almost taste it now LOL
båzl
is that tooth polish? it looks so cute!
I need to stop watching Naomi’s food videos before I go to sleep bc without fail I end up with a bowl of ramen in bed
Soak garlic in hot water. The peel swells up and it falls off
You should have used Rasspberry Sherbet /Sherbet is kinda like Ice cream instead of that Strawberry milk and then put your jello and sprite or ginger ale soda and then mix in your fruits /melons We always used it as a drink at parties when we were kids LIke a Party Punch
For the GARLIC TRICK to work well you must gently palm heel strike your garlic before adding it to a GLASS mason jar. THEN you SHAKE IT LIKE A POLAROID PICTURE! but harder and for like a whole minute lol.
In highschool I went through a phase where I wouldn't eat anything for dinner except egg drop soup. I am so surprised some people have never had it. It's really good
Vincent is so sassy for no reason 😭 there wasnt any melon on his spoon
The "least exciting, most basic" recipes have been around for EVER for a reason girly 😂 I truly enjoyed this video and I'm so happy for your successes. Congrats to my favorite YouTuber 🎉🤟💙
I LOVE UDON lol 😅
So good to see you ❤🎉🎉🎉
When peeling garlic, I turn my knife on the side and gently smash the garlic. You don't want to smash the clove, but it will smash open the casings and make it easier to peel them off in one go 👍🏻
this clip of rm made me a little sad now because in this live stream him and Jin were singing Justin's song peaches and Jin unconsciously curses and rm tries to give him hints but he still doesn't get it and keeps singing. i miss him so much now.
U can buy peeled garlic
The One Piece sound effects fits perfectly 😂👌🏼
in indonesia we have es buah and its pretty much the same as the first thing you made but its not made with sprite LOL its syrup and milk. You also have variants with jelly and bread and its actually really populair in indonesia and tastes really good
Smash the garlic with the flat side of a knife, it cracks the shell and makes it easy to peel
You added too much water to the egg for egg drop soup, you also poured it too fast. Practice makes perfect so try again! 🍜
It wasn't the video you showed, but I actually tagged you in one of those fruit soup videos
a super easy way to peel garlic is to turn your knife to the flat side and crush the garlic; the peel should pop right off and the garlic is crushed which releases more of the flavor
I LOVE YOU NAOMI!!❤❤😊❤
IM SO GLAD IM NOT THE ONLY WHO DISLIKES MELON AND MAC N CHEESE
I think you should have used a glass container to break the peels of garlic
I loooove egg drop soup especially with the crunchy noodle things 😁
Crush the garlic a little with the flat side of a knife, the peel comes right off easier ❤
Naomi is Literally me adding cheese to everything 🤣 Btw you have to let the soup or the broth boil then reduce heat then add starch slowly while stirrin.❤
I really wish I had the courage to try buldak it looks so good!!
Thats so weird, my husband whose German and our sons when they eat Garlic you can smell it on their breath and coming from their pores. Im English and that doesn't happen to me. I wonder if it has something to do with your blood type or ethnicity? Sorry im all about genetic science
I thought she was gonna make sago :(
Sriracha honey tofu!!
To peel a lot of garlic, squish it with the flat part of your knife until you hear a crack. You should be able to peel it with your hands afterwards!
If you’re baking the garlic, you don’t have to peel them first! Once they’re baked, you can just wait for them to cool off a bit, and then squeeze the cloves out super easily.
can we talk about how funny her cat is sitting at 4:41
GIRL WTF LIPPIES ARE YOU WEARINGGGGG IT DONT MOVE !!!
I was listening your video on TV and at the end when you meowed my cat answered you! :'D He was looking and meowing at me, and I was like "It wasn't me it was Naomi". I wasn't sure if he was meowing because he was hungry or actually because of your video, so I listened it back and he meowed AGAIN!! :'D You are a true cat-whisperer gurl! Love you! <3
You should eat Korean food for a week
Girl, what I do to peel the garlic cloves is just kinda twist them with my fingers, like the top and bottom of the clove, you twist em in opposite directions until it kinda "cracks" and the peel comes right off! you don't destroy the clove and it takes like 3 seconds :)
I usually add a little bit of milk in my mac and cheese, it makes it creamier and.. sweety cheesy? Idk it tastes good
There is not such thing as so much garlic 😂
Im not sure if they have these noodles on this app BUTTT yamibuy is the BEST place to get Korean noodles and alot of other products. Im not sure if they ship to Germany but check it out ❤
Namjoon at the beginning caught me off guard Ngl
I’m from the southern part of the US and although it’s against all of the southern religions, I HATE macaroni and cheese! 😱
I buy my garlic already peeled! Love garlic!
Love the hair color ❤❤❤❤❤❤
You Have to try American Mac and Cheese Made in the southern states. It will definitely make sense
The best way to peel garlic is to put it in the microwave for a few seconds. You can then pop them out of their skins. 😊
"For some reason" gurl. Read the instructions on the box. You forgot the milk.
The blurry cat in the back always gets me
Garlic Peeling "trick"=put the garlic cloves in water for like 20 minutes,it'll make it easier to peel,you can soak it for less if you cut the stem part but if you are worried about losing garlic flavor then first one is better,good luck.
Needs to be boiling, for the egg drop. Stir slightly faster than you add the egg
I think you have to make sure the soup boils first or is hot enough before adding the egg for a better texture
y'all don't see the cat in the background on 4:32 🤣
If you squeeze lemon into that fruit milk bowl, it will curdle the milk instantly and the milk solids will separate from the liquid.  It will look very unappetizing.
bäzel bazzle bæzel
Mac n cheese is most definitely overrated
Easy way to peel garlic:  Lay your wide knife on top of the clove horizontally. Press firmly onto the clove. It will pop the garlic out/ remove the casing. Could use pan/cutting board/plate/etc, anything flat will do
her teeth are so sparkly. i love it 😍✨️
If you don't even like homemade mac and cheese, then you're either not making it right or whoever is making it isn't making it right because homemade mac and cheese is so good when it's made correctly. With really good cheeses and enough different spices
Smash the garlic clove whole with the side of the knife. Peel comes right off
for the garlic de-shedding you can just use the flat part of any knife blade and press down until you hear a cracking sound, the skin should pop off really easy ☺️
Pin Me! You crush the garlic with the blade of your knife and THEN you peel it. It's the easiest way, Naomi.
Maybe broth wasn't hot enough
U forgot the milk for the Mac And cheese sauce
Cut the top of garlic bulb off. Place on tin foil, pour oil over garlic add a little salt. Wrap tin foil over it tightly. Put in oven for 2or 3 hours. Then garlic comes right out of peel. Yummy
it has to be a glass jar w/ lid, shake vigorously
Naomi can you please make a review trying silky gems crystal clusters and crystal candy
Its chili sitting in the background gor me
For peeling garlic, I typically just heat it briefly in the microwave (like 5-10 seconds or until warm/hot) and that makes peeling the skin off easier.
What happened to the milk, Kraft requires milk.
I love egg drop soup with a little bit of rice.
Samyang noodles are disgusting fake processed shit
its actually hella hot today in quebec 🥵
buy peeled garlic?
Lemon will make the strawberry milk curdle.
use a garlic press and gently press down till the peel cracks a bit. it helps loosen the peel and then the garlic will come right out. yay! that is how i do it after years of struggling with garlic
Ur supposed to add milk to kraft box mac n cheese lady.
I don’t know about pealing a lot of garlic, but they sell garlic peeling tubes that work really well in my experience
THE NANA OST
Post to put milk
If you like the first dish try a drink called milkis
You can also try the Italian egg soup, you just add Parmesan in the egg mixture 💗✨✨ so it’s also cheesy✨✨
My tip for the garlic is buy pre-peeled ones 🤣 that's what I usually do when I make garlic confit
I love egg drop soup! It’s a staple for me honestly, I have it when I fell sick or just when I have no energy to cook something more complicated 😅 the secret for good egg ribbons is turn off the heat and stir slowly.
Namjoon popping up just made this 20 times better..also made me remember when BTS ate hwachae on In The Soop S2 :)
The garlic trick that makes life a lot easier, place all the individual cloves on a chopping board, and lay your knife flat across the top of them and the push down on the knife. It cracks layer and makes it easier to peel 🫶🏻.
When you make Alfredo sauce you need heavy whipping cream so is no soupy
hihi naomii idk if you’l see this i think if you pour the egg slowly and also mix slowly it might help next time (if there is a next time)
Place the garlic pieces on cutting board, lay knife down flat on top, smack the knife (carefully) with your palm. The skins fall away 🎉
My german grandmother and mother always made me the egg drop soup when I had stomache issues :-)
4:50 i love how the cat’s just sitting there chillin lol
wait doesn't sprite and banana make you vomit?
Your videos always make me laugh and you literally kill every look you do always 🩷🥺🖤
I missed you sooooooo much 🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽
You need to add salt and pepper to plain mac and cheese then topped with shredded cheese once it’s done, also don’t get the powdered cheese get the once that has a bag of cheese lol. I love my mac n cheese 😂
Search for a garlic peeler thats basically just a silicone sleeve. You pop the garlic in, roll vack n forth a few times and you have peeled garlics!
The Namjoon clip caught me VERY off guard.
Naomi has quickly become one of my favourite YouTubers of all time.
For the garlic peeling hack, use two metal bowls clam shelled together instead of a plastic container. Shake it, it is a harder surface so will separate the peels more.
Every time I see him, I think Vincent is Bill Kaulitz at first glance and I love it!!😂😂😂
ela fazendo escaldado KKKKKKKKKKKKK
"its probably not hot anymore, its probably not summer" I LIVE IN AUSTIN AND IT WAS 100 DEGREES TODAY I HATE TEXAS SO MUCHH
In Texas it's always summer 🥲
TIP ABOUT THE GARLIC I work on a restaurant and when i had to peel a large amount of garlic i put it in a container with a lot of water fo4 about 30 min beforehand and then i came out more easily.
rote grütze supremacy 😌✨
As someone who's allergic to garlic that last recipe terrifies me 🥲
Poosi
girl u dont like mac n cheese cause u havent had a american southern momma make u a big ass baked mac!!!! <3
The fruitbowl..You missed some Wodka .. 😂🎉❤
"it is hottt outt" *proceeds to wear a long sleve black shirt*
omggg i just realized this was 8 hours ago i feel like i am not early but at the same time i am anyways love naomi so much :)))
The hair and the make-up 🔥🔥😍😍
as someone who does struggle with eating...it sucks that I have celiac disease because ramen seems like an easy quick thing to consume
Crush the garlic slightly with the flat side of your knife and the skin will come away easily!
for pealing garlic it's so much easier if you briefly soak in warm water. it softens the skin
TIP FOR PEELING GARLIC!!! PLEASE EVERYONE LIKE SO NAOMI CAN STOP SUFFERING!!!! There is a kitchen tool made for peeling garlic. It is literally just a silicone tube that you roll pieces of garlic in and it peels so clean and amazing ✨
Naomi, I would LOVE LOVE LOVE a new hair dying video. It’s been too longgggg and I’d love to see a new color on you. 😘💗  Also did you add milk to the mac n cheese? That may be why it’s dry; it needs milk. With that added, I would think it’d help reduce the spicy.
Lemon would probably curdle the milk 😐
lemon + strawberry milk seems like a very bad idea lmao it's probably better just to make the sprite flat before putting it in
@naomijon don't mix milk with lemon juice! Mixing an acid like lemon juice or vinegar with milk is a hack to make buttermilk in baking, and it will curdle your milk.
Is msg not a bad thing to put in your body
I MISSED YOU
in Spain we also do that kinda egg soup but adding fried bread and garlic and it's super good! you should try it some time
Careful with adding lemon to milk, it will curdle it and turn it into a version of buttermilk(this is how I make buttermilk for baking at home). I have never tried it with flavoured milk but the concept is the same
Naomi is my literal queen 🥺👑💕
The fastest way I've tried to peel garlic is literally just smashing the cloves with the side of a big knife and peeling them that way. You really gotta smack it, but they peel like a dream when you get it right.
I thought we all came to the conclusion years ago that we shouldn’t eat bananas, and sprite together. I’m assuming the milk cancels it out but I don’t know.
for garlic…i always smash the cloves with the flat side of a knife first. the peel is a lot easier to get off when it’s smushed for me at least. give it a shot
I don’t get this Korean fruit bowl thing. What is the korean in it? It could basically be created by a toddler but what where when why korean ?
Naomi: it's probably getting colder it's not thay hot not feeling that summery Me: "it's fricken 98 outside rn with a high humidity 😭
My grandma used to alllways make vegetable soup with the egg dropped like that!! I miss her soup so much
The first recipe would've been good without the banana for me personally, imagining the mix of  textures is kind of driving me insane
the namjoon cameo help
I peel garlic but cutting off a tiny piece from each end and then it just unravels!
sock garlic cloves in the water for 2 hrs in luke warm water before peeling them. it'll make your job 10x easier.
I don't eat garlic... so my face was this 😮😮😮😮 at the end!  Omg 😂
girl the amount of lipgloss you ate in this video...
Noooo not the last time! I will never get tired of watching you eat ramen.
Alfredo’s pasta doesn’t exist in Italy!
mother broccolis videos are the best to calm down
P.S. You should cut the brown tip from garlic and then it will peel easy (you could cut both tips if it is still hard to peel)
I never saw the Basil and Cream Buldak here in Korea. 😮 I guess it’s not as popular. Similar to Buldak Habanero Lime which I discovered in Vietnam but never found here in Korea (except in online shops)
The best way to peel garlic is to keep it in water for a while and then peel it. It's a really perfect method. Let me tell you how I do it .I fill a bowl full of water, then I put the unpeeled garlic in it and peel it. Sometimes when the peels don't come off, I put them in again and continue. It's a life changer.
put garlic cloves in water for 30mins then it will be easy to peel
Ur cat is sitting likes its having a mental crisis 😭😭😭
the tictok used instant kraft mac and cheese for the microwave, you used the stovetop box that requires butter ,milk, and packet of cheese.
We make egg drop soup with roasting some cumin seeds in oil, adding broth and paprika powder, then adding the eggs!
“It probably won’t be hot when you watch this” me in florida looking at the 85-90° weather 👁️👄👁️   Edit: for Europeans, it was 32°C earlier. It’s evening rn and it’s cooled down to about 30°
let us know how ur shittin girlie <3
the best way to make mac and cheese is to get the box mac and make it and put some cream cheese in it and some garlic powder and the cheese pack stuff and maybe some milk and then when you have it in bowl you put parmesan cheese. 10/10 thank you!
Buy prepeeled garlic xD
I've literally never left a comment like this on a youtube video, but Naomi you are literally my  favorite youtuber ever and literally  the only one I watch. I have been following you ever since you were testing freckles products and started dying your hair crazy colors. I literally love your whole persona and I just wanted to tell you that you mean the world to me and I very often find comfort in your videos when i'm going thru something. Lots of love from Serbia ❤
Okay but the ramen mac and cheese would be better if you imported Kraft Dinner from Canada.
I recommend adding more strawberry milk than sprite it tastes better that way (in my opinion)
I L O V E your vids.
You must haven’t had southern mac and cheese
Separate the cloves of garlic from the bulb, press on each one kind of lightly to medium with a jar or something until you hear a faint click, then take each one and twist it in the middle. Oftentimes the peel will come off cleanly in two pieces, othertimes it will only remove half of the peel but it will have loosened to the rest. Also, don't use a giant knife like that to peel and chop garlic, use a small knife.
That amount of garlic would send me straight to the hospital for a stomach pump
Omg pls dont add lemon into milk for ur hwachae 🫠
bæzil
did hwache change lol since when did we use strawberry milk???? did korea change that much since i've left
Naomi is leading the busiest life rn but I swear the quality of her videos never ever drops!
Fun Fact: in my country (I'm from Rome) the egg soup is called "Stracciatella" (yes, like the gelato flavour). Also, I'm living for this kinda kabuki-ish make up you're rocking today!
chili is the most orange cat i've ever seen
Smash the garlic with the flat side of your knife, the peel will let loose real quick. Or at the Asian store pre-peeled garlic 🧄 in containers ❤
Abi, our Lumpia Wrapper Queen made it to your video ✨
For the garlic I cut the butt off and crush it on the board with the palm of my hand maybe everyone does that and it's not a hack but the skin comes right off
Girl have you ever had Mac n Cheese made by a black person?? Cuz whew child, the way my mom makes it is just absolute perfection!! 😩😩
is that painted? and is it cracking? 8:32 8:32
vincent looking like a ig model WHAT
I’m so hungry right now 😂😂😂
My grandma used to stir eggs into our noodlesoup, so I thought that was smth normal :D
If u r gonna slice ur cloves and crush them anyways, smack the garlic under the flat side of ur knife and the skin should pop mostly off
Never stop the Shin ramyun hacks that's the best brand of noodles out there and i need all of the hacks
have u made sago on ur channel before sago looks amaaazinggg it has the same vibes as korean fruit bow
use a garlic peeling tubes its like a silicon rubber tube and you tube the garlic inside and roll and the skin is inside. the inner part of the tube is covered in bumps and ribbed to help get rid of the skin
Please don't add just lemon juice to milk, it will curdle! lol You should try freeze dried strawberries! Blend them into powder and add it to your strawberry milk to make it suuuuuper pink! When I make pink frosting, I just add strawberry powder to avoid unnecessary food dye and it tastes amazing.
Let the sprite sit n decarbonize
4:40 Chile sittin like a human behind you
I don’t know what’s going on with her teeth..anyone know 😭
Vampires will never hurt you, babes
How to peel off garlic easily: take a knife and put it on the garlic clove horizontally, and then give a strong determined push. the garlic will break a little bit BUT trust me, it'll be easy and quick to peel everything off. It works perfectly for me at least!
17:48 😂 "im not going to add cheese to everything" adds more cheese on top in the end lol
buy garlic that's already peeled
Here is a nother trick I saw once how to peel garlic: take the entire garlic bulb in your hand and stab a knife right into a single garlic clove and there you go
Press the garlic clove with the palm of your hand on the cutting board till it makes a "crack" noise, then give it a light twist or two and the skin should come off way easier. After this, if you pinch the pointy end of the skin and squeeze/wiggle, you can sometimes pop the whole clove out
this is making me so hungry because everything looks so YUMMY
for hwachae you can use lemonade instead of sprite for the same flavor but without the fizzy!
Naomi please do not squeeze lemon into your milk. It will not be refreshing lol
I can feel my pancreatitis getting worse just by looking at that garlic sauce
I'm making soup right now. The eggs are going in. Good idea.
@naomijon if you stick a sharp knife in the garlic you could pull out the garlic without having to individually peel them
3:13 food whenever its not dosed with colorants nor a saturated filter lmaoooo
omggg you look amazing wtf
Use a large glass mason jar for the garlic. Shake  vigorously. It works!
For garlic you need to soak in e water for at least 10minuts. *hot water
Do a video where you try to eat sth you usually hate but make different dishes until you like it 😂
Naomi said hwachae and my mind went to tannies making it in Summer Package and then that Joonie clip pls 😭 I JUST MISS THEM SO MUCH, BRING MY FAMILY BACK TOGETHER
Namjoon just popped out 🤣
That's funny, I put ramen and Mac cheese together years ago. I was just a munchy stoner 😅
The fruit salad thing was a huge trend in Korea for a while--lived there for 5 years and it was everywhere, my students were always talking about how delicious it was--and it really is super good. In Korea they use Chilsung cider though which is a very different flavor from sprite.
HAHAHAHAHAHA
those teefs
Glass jar instead of plastic jar to peel garlic easily❤
OMG it has been a long time since a random BTS meme has popped off in a Naomi video I actually felt emotional and nostalgic😭 also mac & shin? such a cool name ha ha
Wow just wow the ramen looks delicious
"I'm not going to add ANY cheese! Not everything needs cheese!"  *proceeds to add sh*t ton of parmesan* 😂😂😂  I love you queen! 😂🥦🥦🥦💜
Omg where did u get the basil buldak?
Eier in der Suppe haben wir hier in Deutschland auch, nennt sich eierstich 😂
There's a garlic peeler and garlic press I got off Temu XD was like 30 cents and wroks for me, no more garlic smelling hands~
Naomi, to quickly de skin garlic cloves, put the individual garlic pieces on a flat surface, and take something flat (a big flat knife to gently press down on the pieces, until they almost crack, this releases the skin, chop off the top brown part, and easily peel.
it’s september and in texas it’s still over 100 degrees
How did you get the basil noodles? Would love to try them🥰
No idea how naomis lipstick and tooth gems stay perfect in these videos
Just take the garlic clove and smash it under the flat side of a large knife the peel will come off. There were two ramen ads on this video. I’m not sure how you don’t have a fully lucrative ramen sponsorship at this point! 🍜🤭
i had a heart attack after seeing the amount of garlic in that tiktok video, girl are you fine after eating that?? im concerned :c <3
try f&n ice cream soda instead of sprite!!
Put garlic in the hot water (not boiled tho) before peeling it. Wait like maybe a couple of minutes and start peeling (don’t drain the water immediately, take garlic from it). And use your knife to peel them cloves. This will make a process so much faster, I promise🩷
Please do not put lemon into milk you will curdle it.
If you put garlic in a mason jar and shake it like you're at gun point, or use a silicone baking sheet and rub the garlic inbetween them they should peel. I wouldn't know though, I'm allergic lol
Add strong mustard and smoky cheese to mac and cheese, and maybe paprika. You'd love it 🤌🏻
I love cassyeungmoney recipes! You should try some of her takeaway hacks - the beef and broccoli is now a regular favourite.
@4:49 THE CAT😂😂😂😂
You would love my Mac and cheese 😂❤
First you take your knife and squash the garlic gently with the flat side of the knife the garlic will pop out of it skin much easier
in poland we have something liek the egg dropped soup with with flour so its thick like noodles
about the garlic, just cut the end and tip of it but not completely.. it will help in the pealing process :)! another tip > try to boil the garlic in water for 10 min instead of frying it in oil, it will reduce the powering taste of garlic
OMG Naomi used Zoros theme…. ❤❤
yayyyyy our queen uploaded😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Do you have pre-peeled garlic available in grocery stores?
its spicier because the majority of the spice pack stays in the broth and not on your noodles. When youre eating it as a soup youre essentially dipping the noodles in the broth but not eating the broth
You have to slice the top and the bottom of a garlic clove, then smash the side of the garlic clove with the side of a big knife.
if noodles are dry, you'll taste the sauce mor because it's not watered down
Lol you're supposed to add a splash of milk with Mac n cheese.
I swear I am in my soup era! Thank you for showing me the egg drop soup 😍😍
hi naomi can u do a video about your favorite german foods? id love to learn more about your culture 🩷🩷
For the garlic you should squeeze it under the knife with the knife 🧐 , I I don’t know how to explain more I guess I hope you understand🧐🧐
egg soup... i had it as a kid in school. Loved it always
NAOMI YOU HAVE TO TRY MY BEST FARTING RECIPE. The ✨shallots tarte tatin✨ The tarte tatin is traditionally a pie with caramelized apples for dessert but this time make it SAVORY.  It got shallots cooked in butter, sugar and balsamic vinegar, herbs, it's so delicious it's insane 😭 And will make you fart for 24 hours 😏 If anyone wanna try lemme know I'll just have to translate the recipe!
My tip, either buy pre peeled garlic. Or simply cut off both ends of the garlic and/or smash is lightly with your knife. This way the peel comes off easier.❤😂
When I peel garlic I firs cut off the tip and then press down on it with a knife or whatever is flat, peels right off 👍🏼
As soon as you said it was hot I knew what you were gonna make, it’s been all over my fyp😭
Honeeeeeeeee  You just haven't had the right homemade mac and cheese...  Girlllllll true Mac N Cheese has to have flavor 💯   The moment I heard I don't like Mac N cheese my heart went into my stomach! Lol 😭😢 Now I'm craving it 🤣
Naomi: im not gonna add graded cheese for once, and I’m not gonna add cheese to everything! Naomi 2 seconds later: adds graded Parmesan
today was my birthday and I was really down thank you for uploading Naomi you def made my day better 🥰🥰🥰
Knoblauchtipp: ich schneid von jeder Zehe an beiden Enden ein Stückchen ab, dann drück ich auf die Knobizehe bis sie leicht knackt und dann löst sich die restliche Schale mega easy ✌🏻👌🏻🧄
Broccoli Queen’s cooking skills have improved over the years 👏💖
Ich find rote grütze ist ne Mischung aus Götterspeise und Grießpudding
Garlic peeling tip: crush the clove with the flat part of your knife blade, it's gonna do you wonders 😌
For the garlic u shoud put it in water for 5 min or so, it will be so easy to peel
can you pls show or tell me what products you used fur your red lips with the gloss? i want to do them like u so bad :/
Ima be honest I don't have a tip  but where I buy them they sell the garlics without the skin, so maybe you can find that sort of supermarket lol
Spooky 🎃 season On the doors Sis
For some reason 😹😹😹
namjoon caught me so off guard 💀
The lip make uppppp omggg 😍😍😍
I thought you already made hwachae so during the whole intro of the video I’m thinking hmm I should do make hwachae only to find out you’re making hwachae now and I have to question why I have this memory of you making hwachae if this hasn’t happened yet
Press the knife on the garlic’s it helps it peel off faster ❤
as much as everyone hates flat soda, maybe if u make it next time try it with flat sprite?? like open it stick it im the fridge until u need it and thennn poor it in
CAT 15:58 😮😂
BÄZL 🥰
I do peel garlic like that, but I found it works better if you cut the ends first
I always feel sad when Naomi's videos end  shes so fun😭
u shud try all the maggi noodle flavours from Malaysia 👀
I really loved the Monkey Island music that played a couple of times during the garlic pasta part :3
Egg drop soup is my favorite but it has to be very hot like toungue burning hot
In Bangladesh 🇧🇩 we have a soup called " maggi soup" and we mix egg just like egg drop soup 😅
You should do a video where you google yourself and see what media says about you
You look like a member of  KISS! Freakin love it! 🤘🏻
naomi, if you don’t like normal mac and cheese you should try kimchi mac and cheese! it’s delicious and way more flavorful!!
Das video war mal wieder toll danke und die rezepte werde ich auf jedenfall ausprobieren <3
omg u look so good
If you get a full garlic smash it down with the root . You can also do that with the pieces that didn't peel quickly.its easier too get the peel off
Naomi im going to help you! You can buy pre-peeled garlic at Asian markets😌   💚🫵🏽🥦🥦
havent tried myself but cut garlic in half like all of them into top and bottom , roast in ofen and then you should be able to just push them out ...
For the egg drop soup i think you should mix a little slower, and cook on a lower heat :))
do salada de frutas manas tu vai adorar
For the egg drop soup, don't stir with it with the eating spoon you should stir it with a ladle  And don't stir it too fast
o primeiro é literalmente salada de frutas Naomi kkkkkkkk
Egg drop soup is the texture from my nightmares but a way somehow hers is kinda ok
Omg Joon singing peaches 😻💅🏻
mac was dry cus u didnt put milk in it..
Smash the garlic with a knife before peeling
Not sure if someone else said it but I think your egg drop soup wasn't hot enough. Like I think it should be like more than simmering I think.
If you make the first one again try strawberry ice cream or sherbet instead of milk. We make this as a drink in the US. 😊
You should definitely try Brazilian food
Garlic peeling hack: cut garlic ends on each side. Press the knife down on the garlic laying on a surface (not too much). This makes the peel loosen (almost completely). This saved me a lot of anger <3
I love Naomi bc how she speaks german and english like me and how she’s so funny and shes my number one fav YouTuber!
I miss her hair dying videos so much😢😢😢😢 she rarely makes them anymore, and when she does someone else does it for her which removes the fun element 😢💔
Naomi: I'm not gonna add cheese to this one guys, I don't always add cheese  Also Naomi: proceeds to pour parmesan on her meal 2 seconds later
Garlic peeling tip: cut off that little hard root tip on each garlic clove! It make the peeling sooooo much easier once that little root nipple is gone 😅
Not me dying of excitement at 18:06 with the Monkey Island 3 music. (Exact name is Monkey Island 3 [OST] [CD1] #02 - Chapter 1: The Demise of the Zombie Pirate LeChuck)  This made me appreciate you so much more ♥
Cat is casually dissociating at the back at 4:40 😭
the only thing about the egg-drop soup for the egg to be a little thicker, is to avoid diluting it with water 💛
The Diabetes has entered the chat
Ich lieeeeeeebe Knoblauch, i gotta try that
Girl, crush your garlic with the knife and cut off the ends. Skin should come off super easily! Easy peacy lemon sceezy 🎉
🤍
At this point im making myself hungry,because its a skl night and im extra hungry,anddd its 11 almost 12😭😭
I always make mac n cheese by just putting macaroni and grated cheese in bechamel sauce and its soooo good!  Very important not to forget to put pepper and nutmeg in or else it will be bland
Love egg dropped shin ramyun
As for garlic, the easiest way is to cut off the ends and crush them gently with a knife before peeling. 👌
If you don’t want your hands to smell like garlic afterwards rub your hands on your sink or something stainless steel.
das mit dem KNoblauch im Tupperware geht tausend mal besser wenn du entweder den Knoblauch vorher ein bissi in Wasser einlegst (verliert aber auch ein bissl Geschmack) oder einfach nur das harte Kapperl unten abschneidest, also einmal durch die harten Kappen abschneiden, das geht wirklich schnell, und dann ins Tupper und schütteln. bringt natürlich nur was, wenn man wirklich VIEL Knoblauch braucht. <3
Naomi, could you try cooking something like lane kluski (from Poland). It's one of my favourite dish. It's simple and basicly cooked when you're sick.
Whatever you do, do not put lemon in your milk! It'll curdle 😬
As a jew it's nice to enjoy something German lol
4:21 that was so satisfying 🩷🩷🩷🩷
It’s giving e-girl dragon fierceness we love it and ramen hacks
Please be careful with a lot of garlic. There is something called garlic poisoning. My friend went to the ER because she poisoned herself with garlic
As an Eastern European, the local version of the egg drop soup was literally every kid's worst nightmare in the school canteen, funny to see Naomi enthusiastic about it :'D
Actually there is an easier way of baking a garlic which is just taking a whole garlic and cutting the top part of the whole garlic. Then drizzling alot of oil of top and than cover it which aluminium foil and bake. Then after that just squeeze the whole garlic and the baked garlic would be out
Girl do you listen to stray kids??? If not please do they are amazing 🎉💗
With a knife, smash (don't crush) the individual clove of garlic before peeling it. It will release a natural oil that makes the skin peel off more easily.
You should try Indian food 😋😋😋
4:38 - the way Chili is chillin is just 😍😍😍😍😍😍
My trick to peeling a lot of garlic is buying big tubs of peeled garlic cloves at the Asian grocery bc I'm too impatient 😂 but also putting them in between two large bowls (one inverted so they form a sphere) and shaking the hell out of them helps peel them also!
Squeeze the garlic before peeling it
can we pleas have a xmondo naomi crossovr pleeaassee? its what we all need in life!
As soon as she said “severely dehydrated” I was like “*GASP* 화채?!” LMAOOO
For the egg drop, to get thicker egg, I slowly drizzle in the circular motion without stirring. Once all the egg is added just a slow stir, and your good to serve. Stiring too fast/hard like you were and not letting the egg set caused the egg to get really small.
You can buy bags of pre peeled garlic 👍🏽
"im not gonna add grated cheese" *cuts to adding grated cheese*
omg, NAOMI! i literally made myself a big bowl of ramen and now we will eat together 😅❤
Gibt doch eingelegten Knoblauch zum kaufen, ist das nicht das gleiche ?
"last week we ate noodles, and this week, we are eating noodles"
new naomi video ❤❤❤❤ thanks for the upload girl
PSA: Please don't squeeze lemon into your milk. It will curdle. Lol
5:34 😂 „the noodles, tha pasta whatever that is“ yes naomi its… uhm… macaroni
Love your soup base wasn't hot enough. You were just mixing in the egg to your soup base instead of cooking it. Next time have a higher temperature. And a slower stir.   Garlic.. Says No Italian ever. Oh this is too much garlic. Oh god that made me laugh.😂 Yes my grandmother could tell if I ate garlic. Even if I ate it 3 days ago. Do I care No. Mosquitoes don't eat me. I'm good with that. I would rather stink like garlic. Then not.  Go out to a home store or even at your local grocery stores you can find, Crock. A small crock. Enough to hold at least two heads of garlic.  There is a garlic sleeve you can buy. It's made out of a rubbery silicone. You put your garlic cloves inside of it and run your hand back and forth. You can do 3-5 at a time. Or take two metal bowls. Put both of your broken down clothes into the bowl the more the merrier cuz they help each other de shed. Shake vigorously for at least a minute. 20 seconds come on it's a little of a workout. That's why we Italians have such great arms. Making our own pastas and breads. Scratch- making things from scratch is in our blood.  It is always wise to add a little fresh garlic with roasted garlic. It adds a depth of flavor. Sorry I'm Italian I eat the hell out of garlic.   I will fill my mini crock with two heads of garlic. Fill it with oil. Bake it at 325 With the lid on for 1 hour. The liquid gold in there, the delicious olive oil that you were infusing the garlic with. Heaven sent. With all kinds of things.   Always make sure you're putting a clean spoon or whatever you're using to pull out your garlic. You can leave that on your counter for 2 weeks. Although it won't last in my home longer than one day. 😅  To add a boulder warmer depth of flavor. Almost like the Asian way but a little slower. Oil in a pan. A small pan a very small pan. And two tablespoons of red pepper flake. Heated up slowly. Once your red pepper flakes starts to turn color. Pull it off. Put it in a glass bowl with a lid. And you can leave it on your table. It's awesome to add to soups stews pastas salads anything. Phenomenal.   Be leery of MSG for those of you that have any connective tissue disorder or any issues, MTHFR SNP gene mutations. You can't methylate properly even free MSG I know it's natural. But it can truly affect you. When you eat things high and MSG and the next day you are stiff. Your joints your fingers your face you feel tight. You may even have a headache. You can't methylate properly and MSG is very bad for you. Even folic acid is bad for you. Talk about a slow cell death. That stuff changes into a chemical within the cyanide family. Your body can't tell if it's okay or not. It's a toxin. If you don't have the proper Folate and b12 such as bioavailable B6 B9 B12 which is found in beef liver. If you can't eat the liver, like making your own liver pate. It is wise to buy it freeze dried. This will actually be stored by your blood cells. Five MTHF does not store within the blood serum store levels. It is free in your blood plasma but that's it.. As soon as you stop taking it, it's no longer in your system and you're not methylating properly. Beef liver, your blood cells will actually store the iron the copper the CoQ10 the folate the B12 the B6. If you take over the counter B6 bioidentical It will cancel out folate. You can't even take them together. Beef liver is one of the best sources ever. It actually brought my son back to life. Never crawling, never cooing. Never babbling. Not walking. Injured. I'm not allowed to say why. Beef liver carnivore diet brought him back to life. Where he started talking literally from Mama Dada to full sentences. I can't stress how important folate B12 and for those that have double clotting factors B6 is.
Put garlic gloves in 2 metal bowls. Like it makes a dome, then swirl and shake the bowls and voila all cloves will be naked ❤
I already know watching this at 9 pm will worsen my head pain and make me nauseous but I'll still do it to give mama broccoli the watch time
Naomi how did you get the Samyang basil noodles?? 🙏🥹
HI please where do you order ur ramen *website*
I MISSED YOU
i"m loving your rad lip color ❤✨
9:58 if u want it thicker you actually have to make like a dough (add a little flour, salt and pepper) ma grandma always makes it like this 😊😅
Lay the blade parallel to the clove and slam your palm down on the blade over the garlic it will crack that annoying shell and will peel off much easier
All you have to do is smash the garlic clove with the flat side of your knife, and the skin will instantly come off, usually in one piece. Just be careful not to cut yourself!! ❤
I NEEEEEED the Basil and Cream Samyang noodles in my life
A tip for "peeling" garlic: Just cut a little vertical line from the bottom to the top. Then you can just flop the skin off. :)
THE NAMJOON PART IN 1:53 HELP 😭😭😭
Use a knife and face it flat on top of the unpeeled garlic clove, then firmly push down using your palm on the knife. It squashes the garlic and releases its flavor but also peels the clove for you so its peel should just fall off.
its very funny because the eggdrop soup is kinda traditional in hungary, but ofc with more hungarian seasoning. kids get this soup in school, in fact we actually call itt dog soup because back in time grandmas cooked it for the dog in winter😆
When peeling garlic I always flatten it with my knife first and then cut both end bits off. If you do that, the skin should come right off :))
To peel the garlic, you should smash them individually and the peel just goes off pratically by itself
Naomi is so perfect but I really want to watch her sparkly teeth further … how did you get those crystals in there?
I LOVE THE HAIR AND MAKEUP IT'S GIVING MACAW BUT IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE
If u make the hwachae next time u can use milkis instead of sprite!! Its rly good
Not the Monkey Island chapter song 🤣🤣🤣
You have to crush the garlic with the blade of the knife and then it will clean up super easily
Love the makeup!! The mascara wand as eye liner looks so good on you Naomi 🫶🏼
Yass foodie mama broccoli is back get it girl. Btw super proud of you killlin it on your. Come to America soon 💕
I'm not sure if this is ok for garlic confit, but if you don't need whole cloves, I just cut the garlic clove in half (longways, I believe) with the peel on and the peel comes right off as you separate the pieces.
the egg soup is pretty normal here in my country and it tastes sooo good <33
Looking like a anime MC 🤩
Oh my goodness that’s me in the TikTok ❤❤❤❤
nooo don't squeeze lemon into the milk 🤣🤣
Omg, she could have used the peaches to reference I.N's horrified face in the live with Chan and Felix😭
I 💯 agree with Naomi about mac and cheese!!
the one piece sound effects 😭😭
Kizz
I can tolerate spice quite well but the samyang buldak cheese ramen is sooooooo spicy I can barely eat it. How do people do it? 🥲🥲🥲
egg drop soup is absolutely amazing
Guys, please NEVER have the egg soup when your stomach is really sick  I had it when i was sick and oh boy....This proteins went full force on my poor stomach Just always remember that this have a lot of protein   Good for after workout snack tho
The Namjoon clip 🤣
Ilyyyyyy
Trick that works...  leave the garlic in a bowl of very lighty warned water for a couple of minutes. When the peel softens it peels so easily! And the garlic will still he raw.
Your makeup always looks so pretty 😍
Naomi, for the mac and cheese hack, you forgot to add the milk 🥛. On the kraft box, you add butter and milk with the powder
please stop cutting out you eating one of the best parts of the videos was you eating lol (in the least weird way possible 😨)
You need to try real southern mac and cheese . lol
🥦
I’ve tried the ramen and Mac and Cheese combo and it was everything I needed!
The pink soup thing reminds me of when I lived in Poland and that’s what we would get in kindergarten fruit soup
Hii, um knoblauch schnell zu schälen zerdrückt man die mit dem messer und die Schale löst sich von alleine 🤗
You can smash the garlic then peel them it would be easier 😊
was that....Monkey Island music??
Omg i used to do the ramen + box mac and cheese thing as a child and i completely forgot abt it 🥹
I’m amazed at how your lipstick stays on this whole time.
You can let the garlic cloves soke for a few hours and they will pill so easily
TIP TO PEEL GARLIC EASIER: Put it in the microwave for 10 or 20 seconds and you can easily do it ^^
Easy garlic peeling tip Italian and French chefs do: use the flat part of a knife and gently crush the garlic clove. I slice off the butt of the garlic and the skins falls right off!
Egg drop soup from the Chinese place when your sick is heaven ❤
my comfort place
A fruit creme soda?
That ramen sounds interesting
Okay my day just got better
i never try my food while cooking it too 😂 my bf shames me for it but i dont like it at all, idk why
For your garlic, I usually crush it under a knife and it makes it easier for the skin to come off. The garlic will be crushed but least the skin is off ? 🤷🏻‍♀️
The best way to peel garlic is soaked in water more than 5 minutes 15:48
Probier mal ein originalen ungarischen egg drop soup rezept aus, bei uns ist das eine suppe was unsere omis sehr gerne machen🥰
I LOVE NAOMI'S MAKEUP ❤❤❤
You had to add milk to the mac and cheese😢
Mom and dad posting on the same day????😭
Helloooo
HELLOOOOO EVERYONEEE❤❤ HI NAOMIII IM LATE BUT HIII❤❤❤❤❤😊
“we have not gathered here today to perform some kind of satanic ritual” damn maybe next week then
Appreciate that you did the whole video meat free. Recipes i can actually try.
Try using strawberry ice cream then sprite it will turnout more more pink
Naomi I need to know the lip combo that can handle that amount of soup pls✨😸
My Asian supermarkt (amazing oriental) sells bulk packs of already peeled garlic!
💚💚🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽🥦🥦🥦
Garlic hack! Press the side of your knife against the garlic clove to smoosh it a little bit and then you just pull the peel off!
If you want a trick to peel garlic easily, just cut the bottom(darker one) of little garlic pieces and pull it it would be lot easier than usual i hope it will help🤗❤️
i just realized i’m somewhat early hii
I can tell Naomi doesn’t like Mac and cheese because she’s never had GOOD Mac and cheese. Someone get this woman some good southern mac and cheese
try celebrity ramen hacks next :))
zont put lemon in milkkkkk ....itll spoil the milk
If you put lemon in there, you might curddle the milk :)
If you put the garlic in the fridge for a bit, like a day. And then shake it in the container it will work way better 😊
FOR EGG DROP SOUP!!! you need to edit 2 things in your method for the bigger, ribbony egg bits!!! 1) let the soup base get up to boiling then turn heat to low before pouring the eggs and 2) stir your soup fast (but carefully!) so it has a little “current” & then bring the spoon out of the vortex when you pour in the eggs— the hot soup base will practically cook the eggs instantaneously as they hit the liquid as long, fluffy, ribbony goodness🥰 enjoy!!!!!
Every time someone calls Kraft Dinner 'Mac n Cheese' - a Canadian has their wig snatched.
diese eiersuppe is kindheit liebs
Slap the knife onto the garlic cloves (sideways) or press it onto them until they crack a bit. It's very easy to peel them, even easier when you cut the small stem off 😂
Vincent has the weirdest taste in food… he’s so picky like who doesn’t like watermelon?? It’s just water and sugar 😂😂😂
For garlic: squish garlic with the flat side of the knife, the peel is than easy to remove
Semper Fi Broccolis 🥦🥦🥦🥦🥦
In my country we have something really similar  to the egg ribbon soup , its kind of a survival food if you really out of money  😅
Naomi that was not enough butter for the Mac and cheese! And you’re supposed to add milk!
Please do not add lemon to milk….please….
Crush the garlic with the blade of a knife before peeling them. Makes it so much easier!
4:00 somebody already snacked the custard ;)))))
When I saw that Alfredo pasta I saw Pasta Queen lighting up a candle and shouting “nonna!”
you can soak the whole garlic in the water overnight and then do the container thing or even peel it with your hands it will make it easier. hope it helps😘
Garlic -> CRUSH IT FIRST, I literally just with the palm on my hand or under a knife (flat obvi) crush it so it splits (you hear and feel the cronch) then shake in a box like you did 💖✨
15:44 a good tip for peeling garlic is to put the cloves in some hot water for a few mins before peeling. It will make the peeling a lot faster and smoother 😌
oh naomi also for the garlic trick, i believe u kinda need to shake more ✨violently✨ and perhaps a bigger container might helps, they need more spaces for that collision.
The fastest way to peel garlic is to crush each clove with the blade of a chef's a knife. Basically you lay the blade flat on the clove and then put weight onto it with the palm of your hand until you feel it being crushed lol. Then the peel should come off in one or two pieces. Hope it helps! ;D
I need a shin ramyun hack compilation
i think your water wasnt hot enough for the egg soup
Does anyone have a link to the recipe video with basil tokpokki?
When you shake your garlic, you still have to cut off the two end parts off of each single garlic, then it will work :)
THE MAKE UP IS JUST ON POINT EVERY TIMEEEE
wheeee
oh not the egg soup we had that in school years and years ago and i hated it and cant stand it since then lol. the vid is great though
The cheese powder carries the spice and makes it SO much more intense. I eat Shin ramen all the time but when I tried this it was WAY too hot for me too  ❤🥦
Stop it the RM “I got my peaches out in Georgia” 1:54 😂😂
I desperately need you to try soul food; I think it'll change your perspective on life and mac n cheese
Vicent is so annoying. How an adult person is so picky about food?
i'm seeing you tomorrow in London ❤ so excited for the concert
Here in the US, many stores sell peeled garlic cloves (Whole Foods is one). What a game changer!  I hope you can find some in Germany!
I'm in Kansas
Is the milk and sprite mixture trying to imitate milkis?
msg makes everything better 10:27 @mrnigelng
Was that chili licking his balls on the background at 4:34 ?? Anyways great video  naomii❤❤❤
I only know rote grütze as a sauce with cherries .. or.. some other red fruit i am unsure
Cut of the hard piece of the garlic, put the knife above the garlic and punsh it (be careful) and then it is so easy to peel the garlic :)
food and Naomi is the best combo
The way u pronounce basil and herbs annoy me sm😭
If you hit the garlic with the flat side of a big wide knife once the whole peel will so easily come off !
Naomi u should totally make a video where u try to put on drag!
Wacthing this while eating ramen is superior
u can cut the end off of a garlic clove and it will flay off
that is the most ghetto microwave i’ve ever seen
4:52 i laughed so hard at chilli sitting on the bed just staring somewhere 😂😂😂😂😂😂
i love ur videos so muchhhh  but u dont apload taht much❤💜😮‍💨
craving ramen
The best way to peel garlic quickly: put it in the microwave for just like 10 secs and then peel
Take your garlic cloves, put them on a cutting board and grab a kitchen knife. Press the flat side of a knife on the clove. Smash the flat side of the knife with your palm. Make sure not to cut yourself by angling the sharp side of the knife a little lower than the other.   Et voila. you smashes the clove and its almost peeled. normally you just need to cut the stem a lil and thats it.  Please be careful when trying. Better go slow and practice, before accidentally slapping the sharp end of the knife. ♥
YOU LOOK SO PRETTY!! (*≧∀≦*) <3
Well God knows how long my depressed ass have been waiting for your new video🥹
I always press the flat side of the knife and crush the garlic a little. ( a wide knife is best here). After that I don't have to peel so much and the "skin" comes off almost by itself. Sometime I cut off a but from the tip to help that process.
Stopped studying to watch this and I'm content and happy
The first recipe is just look like a "Sop buah" (translate to Fruit Bowl Soup)
is that the mascaaraaa haaack love itttt
I was a bit confused when she didn't pronounce it watermeloaneee 😂
Girl... if youre gonna make home made make and cheese, just make the cheddar sharper. Or do blue cheese and bacon and french fried onions. Or mild chedder and gouda. Home made is *customizable* thats the fun of it. I dont like bland mac and cheese either. Also if you like it crusty theres so many ways to get some diverse textures in there.
You NEED to try Mexican street corn with Hot Cheetos ❤
i love the one piece sounds in the backround 💀
What a coincidence i did the same makeup today 😂❤
I love food vids ❤❤❤😮😊😊😊
omaga i love u
please make a video about testing viral "garlic girl" recipes🥹
the best way to peel garlic is to smash it with the side of a knife!
Iv heard you can microwave garlic for a time for easier peeling... I haven't tried it yet.
Just sat down with my ramen and saw this video! It was perfect to eat it to :3
Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass ich das sage.. Aber wir brauchen unbedingt eine Shin Ramyun Hack Compilation!
"I´m not gonna add cheese for once!" *Sprinkles the food with parmesan cheese* Love you Naomi:D
ILY NAOMI💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
Why is your cat so orange?
I love that the hack is simply putting two instant things tigether and mixing lol
Place the garlic in warm water for about 20/30 minutes, will be easy to peel them, cold water works too but you need to wait a little more than 30 minutes, OR  you could smash them very hard by pressing them with the broad side of the knife, they will break
the shin ramyun gonna taste spicier that way because shin ramyun supposed to be soupy ramyun not dry ramyun hence why the seasoning kick will be stronger if that makes sense lol
GARLIC PEELING TIPS FROM A CHEF - one way to peel is to cut the bases off each clove then layer between two kitchen towels and rub vigorously to remove the skins. The other best method is to lay the flat side of a chef knife on top of the garlic clove and smack it hard with the heel of your palm. Its scary the few couple times you do it but once you get used to it you'll never go back! Hope that helps Queen Broccoli 🥦😊
Sparkling diamonds, glitter, glossy lips , and shiny teeth is the best makeup combo I have ever seen!
My trick for peeling garlic (15:52) is to chop off the bottom part of the clove (or of the whole head). Much easier to peel.
2 hours ago🗣️ hiiiiii❤️❤️❤️❤️
U crush the garlic clove n it ll unpell itself
Watching this while eating ramen>>
für dieses EierSuppenDing musst du die Eier mit Mehl anrühren, etwas Muskatnuss und Salz. Nicht zu dünn aber auch nicht zu dick und dann reinrühren lassen und schon hast du ne gute Eierstichsuppe ;)
Girl you don’t like Mac b cheese because you haven’t had southern Mac chefs kiss
In Canada we can buy jars of minced garlic. It's a game changer for me. I love garlic but I hate peeling it
Love this kind of videos 😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
Pasta and noodles are my fav autumn/winter food 🥰 love these type of videos Naomi 💚
omg i just came from cram school and all i needed was a new video of naomi eating cheeeeeessssy noodles
ur cat sitting on ur bed and zoning out is a mood honestly
Garlic hack: cut off the ends and smash it a little with your knive, then the peeling is really easy and the garlic flavor is stronger because its slightly opened/broken
GIRL DO NOT ADD LEMON TO YOUR MILK IT WILL *CURDLE*
This looks sooo wrong 3:52 😂😂😂
you should do a video of eating like a kpop idol can be your bias or a member of ateez
Just made ramen and this goes online, perfect diner video
On the egg drop soup, make the broth hotter (simmering to boiling) and stir fairly slowly. That way you'll get the thick ribbons :]
You have to smash the garlic clove a little bit with the back of your knife and then the peel falls off easily 😊
If you add lemon to milk you'll end up with buttermilk with fruit
Naomi ur the best, I want to ask u who is ur bais from bts 🙂💗
Naomi is close to 3 MILLION ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨... Lets get here there 🥦 🥦 🥦 🥦 🥦 🥦
egg drop soup is my go to hangover meal 😂 Love it
My german mum always made a egg drop soup <3
5:14 OMG This is my exact experience with mac and cheese! Every single time with different recipes and places! I don't get the hype of it 😭
I wouldn't have eaten the first one I despite watermelon
To peel garlic you have to squish it with a flat part of a knife or press it with some flat object like a cup. It will peel quickly and without any effort.
Hiiiii
Pls for the love of not wasting food don't squeeze lemon into milk 🤣
on the topic of peeling garlic quickly - crushing the garlic with a flat surface usually makes it easier to peel and therefore gets the job done quicker 💪
"when u watch this its probably not that hot anymore" laughs in florida
7:50 das nennt sich Stratiatella Suppe und gibts beim Italiener😊
Can u do a video trying Chinese makeup brands
I early broccoli 🥦
I’m 2h early 😍
The Shin ramyun in the red package is MUCH spicier than the bone broth Shin in the black package
15:49 put your garlic in weather and let it rest for like 1to 3 minutes .
The friziness (?) makes Hwachae so much better imo! It even tasted much more refreshing that way
4:40 Why Chili looks so funny in the background I'm dying 😂😂😂
I actually think you didn’t add enough cheese to the Alfredo
Naomi it takes like 2 metal bowls and way longer than 20 seconds my uncle had me and my sister do it for him all the time LOL we would go outside and shake for like 2 whole minutes
The egg soup is what my dad always made me for whenever I was sick, my grandmother made it for him when he was a kid! She actually just mixes milk or cream with the eggs and drops it it chicken broth, the stirs. In Switzerland we add some Maggi or some Aromat and then voilà!  EDIT: to peel garlic, there's a very easy technique: you have to lay the garlic clove flat (sort of flat) and then you place the side of your knife on it ( the non-cutting sides). You give it a quick smash and it's gonna peel of on its own (my explanation is terrible, I saw Antoni on Queer Eye doing it, it really works, look it up)
The egg soup is a very common soup we do in Italy when you're feeling feverish and you usually add tiny pasta (like Orzo shape) and you'll feel good as new! ❤❤
Naomiiiiii!! Crush your garlic a little with the side of a knife to make it easier to peel 💖
Ahh I’m early for the first time!! Let’s go
I definetly wanna try the egg drop soup! Seems delicious
Made it in a hour
Just squish the garlic with a side of the knife youre using
Spam and Japanese mayo change shin ramen. Trust me 😂
"a little bit overmakeuped"
I would try the garlic pasta with less garlic
Lmfaoooo
my husband ( namjoon ) 🥺🥰
maybe you haven't had good mac and cheese with an elbow in it loll 🌚🌚
YEAHHH IM EARLYYYYYYY
For the egg drop soup you can just mix the water so it like twirls around(?) and pour the egg mixture in a circle :D (some ppl don't mix it until the very end too)  Also for the ramen Hack with the Mac and cheese, it may have been more spicy because that ramen is supposed to have a broth (making the powder diluted and less spicy and salty) :D!!
For my egg drop soup i like to get it to a strong boil, stir it a few times and then pour in the egg very slowly while not stirring. I also add BROCCOLI for some texture and fiber 2 minutes before adding the egg, don't overcook your veggies tho 💚
0:44 lol not that hot outside anymore… as I watch from Florida… 90F 😅😅
I lover herrr so much i can't live without her 😭♥😩
Naomi acting like she doesn't always have that much makeup on
The trick is to buy pre-peeled garlic from your produce department. We have this in American.
Girl nooo, extra virgin olive oil is not for cooking/heating! Olive oil in itself is not very suitable for cooking at high temperatures, but using extra vigin is just a waste when heating at all.
AAHHH I LOVE YOU 🥰 ❤  PS: I’m a lil sick rn and ur the perfect entertainment in this moment 🥹🫡
IT ALWAYS TAKES ME SO OFF GUARD WHEN NAOMI USES OMORI MUSIC PAHAHAH
Says she’s done adding cheese and then adds cheese subconsciously 👁️👄👁️
I love egg drop soup my grandmother always makes it during winter and its just so good I love seeing others try foods that I've been eating for my whole life, Liebe grüße aus Bayern <33
Naomi : I'm not gonna add cheese, okayyyy? 3 seconds later proceeds to add parmesan 😂😂
Why do your eggs have codes? Is that normal😭😭
I love egg drop soup! Try using less water in the egg mixture I only use like half a tsp. And then bring the broth to a boil give it a good store and pour slowly!
Shine ramen are the best instant Ramen.^^
Where did you get the Samyang noodles? 😮
HI NAOMI ILY !!!
Egg drop soup is literally a texture nightmare in my mouth I remember it from primary school so personally I don't like it, but I'm glad you did 😊
Get pealed garlic it saves time
Not that early but still❤
I love your ramen hack videos!!!!!!! Don't feel bad GIVE US MORE 💜✨🔥
Naomi: “ I’m not going to add cheese to everything”   Also Naomi : adds cheese  🤣 love it!
Love your make up girly pop❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😅
OMG Novympia did a parody of you and it’s sooooo goood!! Pls do a reaction video on it
Naomi always slays EVERY look ❤❤❤
I love watching these !! ❤️❤️
Eat watermelon w Tajín and Valentina and you will be able to finish a whole watermelon it’s soooooo good
😂😂😂 as you where talking about Mac and cheese I was eating Mac and cheese
i think the shaking works better in a glass pot
the first one 😅 omg looks like i would need to run to toilet the minute i would taste it
Am I'm eating the carbonara noodles 🍜 as im watching this? 😅 yes, yes I am. They're so so good :3
The soup of fruit bowl thing is giving icecream with a fruitsalad that ended up melting but prob does not taste as good as the  melted icecream lol
You need some black people Mac and cheese
Lot's of love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩💜💜
so I dreamed today that somehow I thought yeah maybe I can get some last tickets infront of your concert ykyk. Then I got there and met my boyfriend whos not having the best opinion on your youtube videos 💀✨️ So he was there with a friend who got tickets and let me say its the biggest biker guy 💀💀💀 So I was kinda pissed and I didnt get any tickets. Somehow I took my pants of in the progress but I was still wearing a dress so idc yk. Then my BF and I got into a fight bcs I was like how dare you go to the concert without me if you know I like her so much like ajxoebgiwnig. 💀✨️ then I wanted to go home my BF came after me. Like obviously like he should??  I realised I left my pants SOMEHOW on the fence. I came back and some bitch stole my pants.  Then I woke up. Im so done fr.
Knoblauch kann man sehr gut vor dem schälen mit einem Messer zerdrücken bis es bisschen knackt, natürlich nicht zerquetschen das der Knoblauch kaputt geht. ❤😂🥦
Really love the unexpected One Piece sounds in this video ❤
why does she think she can put lemon in milk???
4:40 WHY IS CHILLI SITTING LIKE THAT
I am not at cheese - Naomi atting cheese 🧀 😂
Hi Naomi! Since you like the eggdrop soup, you should try the tomato egg drop soup! Marion's kitchen has a great version of it. Hope you enjoy!!
White cheddar mac n cheese is where its at
Extra virgin olive oil is actually the least suitable for heating. Extra virgin has a low smoke point making it burn very easily. It’s best for bread dipping, dressings, and such ❤😊
Loveeeeeeee this videos!!!🥰
for the shin ramen, it was spicier than normal because there was no broth to dilute it it was just straight powder on noodles and for the soup, your broth was probably too cold and so the eggs didn’t cook fast enough to make thicker ribbons you need hotter water (near boiling, not quite boiling or it will shred the ribbons)
I love watching naomi following the recipe poorly
Naomi: I'm not gonna add cheese to everything okay guys 🙄 Also Naomi: and here it is, our finished garlic confit pasta 🥰✨💖 *adds cheese* 🤣
Girl ur probably dehydrated from all the product sucking the moisture out of ur face. Jesus Christ Pennywise the dancing German
Garlic peeling tip: Crush the garlic cloves with the flat of your knife, this will make it easier to peel. Smelly garlic fingers tip: Buy a stainless steel soap bar, this legit works, I wash my hands with it every time I peel garlic and it completely gets rid of the smell!!
Naomi you have to add milk in with the mac and cheese. It makes it more creamy
Y taste garlic in your body😯😯😯😣😣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
If you don’t understand Mac and cheese it’s because you always have bad Mac..  I make a really good baked mac & cheese. It’s like orgasmic good. Sorry you’ve only had bland Mac. Hopefully you can experience amazing Mac one day😢…..
Smash the galic with a tablespoon and the skim will came off
I’ve been eating egg drop soup at least 15 years and it’s my favorite! I don’t even have a TikTok. I love it with fried wonton strips!
she made the mac and shin cheese raymen wrong and that's bothering tf out of me XD
Open the sprite, let it go flat and then add it to the bowl maybe?
unfortunately going THROUGH it right now, almost at my breaking point. thank you for posting, i hope i can calm down
literally today i watched your other ramen hacks videos, i love it
Her makeup is wow😍
I always loved getting egg drop soup from the Chinese buffet as a kid. I think maybe your soup broth should be a little hotter before you add your eggs!
izzDAT meLLEN 4:11 😂 so cute 😊 so next video is all the garlic peeling hacks in the comments!? 😮
17:56 “I’m not gonna add anymore cheese.” Continues to add parm on top 😂 😭
It's over powering because you didn't add the cheese ... 😮 the one dish that calls for cheese and you didn't add the cheese 😢.😊
LIP LINER TUTORIAL PLEASEEEEE
a super easy way to peel garlic is to squish it a bit it with your knife or a solid object (but not destroy it) and then the peel should basically just fall off
Please don’t add lemon juice to your milk, it will turn into curd :,,)
Just smash the garlic with a knife to peel them
Our queen is back! How were your shows?!!! Epic I’m sure!
11:25 No No No Don't do it!! The spiciest noodles I've ever eaten!! LOL  I didn't need lip plumper, after that meal. 😂
PLZ NOT NAMJOON'S- "i got my peaches out in georgia" HAHAHAHAH didn't expect that honestly
Am i tripping or is MSG a drug ?
1:55 I think it's pretty average sized.
If you want to peel garlic just throw some pieces in the microwave for about 5-10s. They will be hot but very easy to peel
Maybe I heard the melody wrong but I thought of One Piece for some reason. 🤨
Novympia really killed it with the parody so much that I can’t not see them in you anymore😊
Lemon would curdle the milk & also with the ramen hack, she just a portion for one person and you did a box for 2-4 😂. That’s probably why the cheese flavor was so overpowering
I also don’t get mac and cheese, but to each their own 🤷🏼‍♀️  And btw I’m loving the 2 AM lashes, they are a part of my daily make up look now😋
I use garlic almost everyday TO PEEL GARLIC take a spoon use the back of it and smash the garlic clove slightly to crack each skin it saves so much time😊
Basil is very overpowering be careful 🧐🤨🤔
if you’re okay with the garlic being crushed, put them under a wide knife (sharp side away from you i hope) and hit the bottom of your palm to the knife, the skin peels off easier
Use a glass container when shaking garlic! Like a mason or old pasta sauce jar. It needs to be more hard sided (not flexy plastic) so it can hit the bottom of the jar and the lid with a solid thwack. And shake HARD. Like you wanna make a ✨racket✨ with how hard you’re shaking. Garlic maracas. It also takes like 30 or 40 seconds lol
In Czechia, we do the eggdrops in a lot of soups, and it ks very yummy
I'll never get over this hair. I have to talk myself out of copying it every time lol.
The eggdrop soup you make, in Poland we make that too but we add some flour to the egg and some warm water.
Lmfao the mac and cheese was for like 4 or more servings.. shouldve used half the box or 1/3 and not all of the cheese. Btw southern american mac and cheese hits. Obviously 😂
Ask an AI to make recipes and follow the instructions :D
Tip ... when you adding the slurry make sure the soup is almost at a boil .
Here 😍
4:49 I'm sorry too Naomi but your cat at the back😭 is he sitting or what, I'm looking at him even tho you're speaking lol
I'm a little late but I just woke up, love your videos
Please don’t make the first one with just lemon or lime juice, the milk will curdle
Omg naomi pleassseeeeeeee come here so I can show you the GOOD homemade Mac n cheese
Add garlic to the Mac n cheese and pepper . When u mix it melt the butter in first , then then cheese , and a sip of milk or cream to just give it some soothing slide.?😊
Naomi: im not going to add cheese to everything ok?? Also Naomi 5 seconds later: proceeds to add cheese on top
If you want to peel a lot of garlic fast put whole head of garlic in container with water leave it for like 10-20 mins the shell becomes mushy so it's easier to remove ♥
Omg i love the Monkey island music in the background with the garlic noodles 😂😂😂😂
putting lemon in milk is-
15:35 when you put garlic in the tub to shake it around just add some olive oil and it should come off easier. (Just did this yesterday!)
You always make me crave ramen 😩
Hit the garlic under the side of the knife and it easily separates from the skin? husk? Anyway, you get the idea.
I’m hungry 🫠🤭 I want some enchiladas but I’ll be having shrimp tostadas 🫶🏼
30 minutes
The best way that I have found works best for pealing garlic is to get the garlic and put ur knife on it sideways so that the flat/face side sits on top of it and that it the knife and it will crush the garlic a a little but it works😊
It's just fruit in milk 😅😅😅😅😅.🤨🧐🤔😐
For the egg drop soup u had to wait til water was boiling to out the egg in .. for garlic use a glass jar and shaking it … I usually crush garlic with my knife and it easier to peel
I really wanna see You Do the Buldak Advent calender!!😭
You’re meant to bring your soup up to a boil before you ad the egg in. That’s why it didn’t turn out right.
this girl is the definition of "slay"❤
Might be a more Thai Basil feel.
I usually put the knife on top of the garlic and then i hit it🥊 to peel it💪
Don't put lemon juice in the milk it will curdle it up like cottage cheese.
Hiiiiii Miss you so much 🥦🥹🫰🏻
4:42 the way Chilly is sitting :DDD
You should stir the pot more slowly when putting in the eggs, so the egg ribbons will be thicker. 😊
I'm so sorry Naomi but I am watching this on double speed. I really wanted to watch before bed but I was just about to log off. 😂😂😴
idk why but i love your food videos soooo much!!!! 🥦🥦💛💛💛💛
Where is your shirt from?? Please😔😔😔‼‼‼‼
4:41 can we talk about the way chili is sitting in the back
“peach” “….yes”
Udon noodles are my favorite noodle ever!!
Those are just very normal Udon Noodles made in a micorwave :D Maybe i have to try this next time as well o.O
When you make Mac n cheese you are suppose to add milk which would have helped with the dryness.
as a central-eastern european i cant believe not everyone used to eat egg drop soup ad a child haha i just had it today, i feel like its super common here
NAOMI - Tipp zum Knoblauch schälen - du musst mit der flachen Seite vom Messer das sozusagen „aufknacken“. Dann geht die Schale so gut wie von alleine ab :)
4:09 vincent looks so daddy there 👀
FOR GARLIC~ Squish/smash with flat side of knife or a plate and put ur body weight Into it. Then the husk comes off suuuuper easy
yas, I'm existing from video to video
Well it has been exposed craft mac and cheese isn’t really real cheese. And the fact that I’ve only had it once and have never touched craft cause it tasted sketch
you have to stir the egg-drop-soup more slowly
✨ 𝓯𝓸𝓻 𝓼𝓸𝓶𝓮 𝓻𝓮𝓪𝓼𝓸𝓷✨
Hi Naomi I want to give you some ideas How to make that egg soup, so put less water in those eggs and When you put eggs in the soup, heat the soup more so that it bubbles
Naomi loving msg…immediately reminds me of uncle roger 😂
slayy queen, I love ramens 🥰
NAOOMIIIIIIII CAMPBELLLL <3
My girl I don't know if the instructions actually call for it but I have always in my life put milk in Mac and cheese and I think it would've made the Mac ramen so much better for you😂😂
for garlic you need to cut it's solid butt and smash it with the flat side of the knife!!!
It's still hot here.. i live in texas so
Put a flat side of the knife on a garlic clove and crush it. It would peel literally itself
I've never been early before! I feel honored. I literally love you Naomi, and your music 🥦🫶🏻
Yes, not that hot...in Texas... a chilly high of 98 degrees Fahrenheit 😭
the egg soup...is just...🤢😵
to peel garlic easily u can sink cloves of garlic in water for some time :-))
Hi Naomiiiii
I need to know if your wearing a chocker or if it's connected to your shirt
Where did you get ur tooth gems???
HI Naomi!! I peel garlic by gently pressing the clove with the side of my knife until it cracks a bit. Then I can peel the whole skin off. If you use a chef knife, you can do this with 3 or so cloves. Love your music and videos! Have a beautiful day!! 💕🥦🥦
Naomi Snack Kweeeeeeeen!
I wonder bc ive heard sprite in germany is terrible
just a quick tip for peeling garlic: just crush it with the side of the knife<3
0:06 Don't say that, you always look so good with any amount of makeup.
I think it’s that you stirred the soup to fast while pouring the egg
The watermelon makes hwache pink! You look amazing Naomi💕
How dose Naomi’s lipstick not come off 😮 ???!!!!
Gonna need to go make egg drop soup
The first food, we have something similar in portugal called "Salada de Fruta" (literally translates to fruit salad), we don't put milk but we do add seven up sometimes and to make it pinkish we use red currant syrup. The best way to do it is leave it in the fridge overnight
As soon you said „im severly dehydriated“ I knew
Naomi if you make the first recipe again do NOT put lemon juice with the milk! Lemon juice and milk curdles! So unless you want milk chunks in your meal, I’d just let a sprite sit out for a while so it’s not as carbonated.
She looks so prrrrety❤
Cut the end of your garlic, crush it with the wide of the blade and pop it out of the peel!
Naomi "I'm not going to add grated cheese for once"  Also naomi *adds parmesan 😂
4:34  the cat 4:40  here again 😂
NAOMI I AM SO HAPPY U POSTED I LOVE U AND ALSO I LOVE EVERY BROCCOLI HERE
now i wanna see naomi make chinese soup!!
not chili licking his balls in the background 💀
Knoblauchhack: du musst mit der breiten Seite des Messers auf die Zehe drücken, damit die leicht kaputt geht, dann kannst du recht einfach die Zehe schälen.
Thank you for the video,  and shout out to the lip combo and overall makeup look it is incredible
How to peel garlic fast: 1. Cut of the tip 2. Press garlic with side of knive (until you hear it break) 3. Peel away
i think this is the earliest i’ve ever been to a Naomi video
In germany we would say: G steht für Gönnen!
The fastest way I peel my garlic is to slightly kind of "crush" it first with the flat side of the knife, for some reason this separates the garlic from its skin, and then you can just cut off the "basal plate" to totally take off the skin. (or leave the basal plate if y'all want idk lol)
My brother once drank coke with milk, that reminded me of the sprite and strawberry milk 😂
26 mins ago when i started watching!!
Lemon will make the strawberry milk curdle broccoli 🥦 🥦
finally she posted
I bought your eyeliner. Then I bought a second one because I instantly fell in love and I'm deeply scared of the time the limited collection ends and I will never be able to get your eyeliner ever again.   Maybe I'll buy a 3rd one just in case...
Girl we waiting on u to review shein and roast them
I can’t be the only person who yells “a new naomijonster” at the screen when I start watching a new naomi vid
i literally started smelling garlic when you ate the pasta lol
The hair, the makeup?!! That Naomi for ya always slaying
Die Knoblauchzehe leicht mit einem großen Messer andrücken (mit der flachen Seite natürlich), dann lässt sich die Schale einfach abziehen. 😀
Kisses from Cyprus
Wrapped up on my couch nursing some killer cramps aaand baybeeeee.. this is exactly what i needed😂
❤
I think the hwachae would taste good with coconut milk, and the shin mac and cheese ramyeon would be better if you add milk to make it more creamy. And for the eggdrop, stir it slower so you get better texture for the egg
Naomi: I'm not going to add cheese to everything!!!! *immediately cuts to adding cheese to pasta* 😂❤
Aaaaa I'm early today yayyay U look beautiful as always
If you get a rubber garlic peeler (its just a simple rubber tube) you can roll the garlic cloves in the tube between your hands and it peels them for you!
YOU MUST TRY ALL BULDAK SAMYANG FLAVOURS AND RATE THEM THIS IS MY 10004838th time asking I SWEAR TO GOD IF YOU DONT‼️‼️‼️
OMG . Naomi you are making me hungry 😭😭😭
Wait...but bananas and sprite make you vomit
To easily peal garlic you just need to crush them with a knife. That's all basically. Hope it helps :)
For the egg drop soup you should stir the soup and then stop and quickly pour the egg in the still moving soup in one stirdy stream. Then wait at least 30 seconds before stiring again 😊 that's how I get perfect egg strings every time 😍🥚👌🏻
Warum hab ich mir bei dem make up look gar nichts spezielles gedacht haha und war einfach nur so: joa Standard Naomi look, sehr nice wie immer😂❤
i love how you eat things that no human should
1:57 thats average
Egg drop soup is so nostalgic to me (even tho I don’t love it😆) as someone from Eastern Europe (Hungary) 😭😭 we got this minimum once a week for school lunch
garlic peeling trick: meine mom hat so ne kleine röhre aus gummi, da tut man die zehe rein und drückt/rollt das hin und her und das funktioniert erstaunlich gut und schnell :)
For me, the best way to peel a lot of garlic, is to put it all in hot water for 5 min and that makes it so easy to take the skin of the garlic. I love garlic confit, so I use it in every recipe I make. I put it in the instant ramen too. Is delicious!
OMG I love Shin Ramyun, pls don't let this one be the last hack. I need them too!
I haven't slept in over 24hours. I will go to bed after Naomi's video :)
Crush each garlic individually. Makes it much easier to remove the skin.
My boyfriend always adds star anise to the egg drop soup which you remove before eating it and it adds a really great flavour to it. Also goes really well with fried rice
Die Eierstich-Suppe weckt bei mir Kindheitserinnerungen. Die hat meine Oma immer gekocht, wenn ich krank bzw. erkältet war. Da war ich so 6 oder 7 Jahre alt.
You can cruch a garlic clove with a big knife or sum and simply take off the garlic peel, it works really well and you don't get garlic behind your nails :D
Mantap kawan
hallo
thank you naomi, i was looking for a ramen vid while eating my ramen and then you came
GIRLIE I WANT, no.. i NEEEED THAT LIPCOMBO!!
Im sorry but the egg drop soup looks like a puked up regular soup
THE MAKEUP IS STUNNING 😻😽🥦
Careful about replacing the sprite with lemon. You might end up curdling your milk, even non-dairy. It won’t be toxic or anything. It just may not be very pleasant
🥦🥦🥦🥦✨🥦🥦🥦🥦✨🥦🥦🥦🥦
The bäzl noodles
omg best way to peel garlic is definitely to just smash it with the bottom of your palm on the counter the shell thingy just kinda comes off or at least comes off in bigger pieces 😩 another way ive seen is microwaving it for a few seconds but not sure how well that works
:D tip for the garlic: Go to a asian supermarket they sell them already peeled. Or at least the korean supermarkets do.  I know this because everytime we come to germany from korea we go to the korean supermarkets in DUS or FR and they always have onions and garlics peeled :)   And that is how I made that pasta a couple of times, without the headache.  And the Samyang Udo Basil Ramen are really nice I agree and they are in every CVS :D Thanks for the video!
It's spicier because it's not with the soup! It's actually my favourite way to eat it.
How is no one talking about the fact that Naomi wants to put lemon in strawberry milk as if that wouldn't react lmfaoooo
do not let uncle roger see this vid... hes not gona like what naomi side about msg   ... o.o
I love your videos ❤
You for sure need to try to mix strawberry milk and lemon juice 🤣🤣🤣
I feel like hwachae is so ingrained in the ateez community im genuinely surprised naomi found it bc of tiktok
I'm so early😮
gurl I'm learning German just because of you, Tokio Hotel and Rammstein 😭
okay right now i want nothing more than egg drop soup🤤
I'm Belgian and for so long I wanted to try the Kraft Mac & Cheese I've seen so many times in tv series. Not so long ago I found a packet of Kraft Mac & Cheese and had really high expectations. I expected a really strong cheese taste but I thought it was really bland and had to add Parmezan cheese to get a strong cheese taste.
How is nobody talking about the One Piece music effects edited in🙌
Eggdrop soup is usual in Hungary
❤
Naomi can you do a mukbang while doing a QnA ❤❤❤❤
ive been missing you and now youre finally here !!!!!

I WAS GOING DOWNSTAIRS TO MAKE RAMEN AS I GOT THE NOTIFICATION WHAT

In America they sell huge tubs of unpeeled garlic 😮
I always smash the garlic with  before peeling it❤
The 'I am gonna get the farties' had me in tears
Amazing video.😍Appreciated as always mama broccoli.💚

Okay, but can we talk about her make up??? Oml
(:
Day early Naomi 🫶🫶🫶🫶
Just a note bake them in the skins then pop them out after
i cant i love ur makeups SOO MUCH in every video. i just cant stop staring
I love your this type of videos love form Pakistan 🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰 love you
Woooooo 🎉🥳🙌 I love this for my Sunday
A good Mac and cheese recipe is Ina Garten’s adult Mac and cheese recipe. It tastes nothing like the boxed version. I’m not a huge fan of Mac and cheese but this recipe is delicious and very easy. The key is good cheese.
hi i follow you since day one
The way i just saw the notification and clicked it instantly!
You can buy peeled garlic 😭
Please make your perfume available in India 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳❤️❤️
I think you just put a tad too much water into the egg mixture and stirred it too fast. It looks alright though.
Omg so early farts from excitement
The makeup🥺❤️
Oooh that egg drop soup reminds me of a dish from Polish/Slavic cousine called "lane kluski". It's similiar but you mix the eggs with flour so they aren't as runny and they clump together. It's really good with rosół aka Polish chicken soup.
im 14 minutes late 😅 but i guess im early ❤
OMG I LOVE UR VIDS SOSOSOSOSOOS MUCH AAAAaaaaaaaa yayyy
Love from India 🇮🇳
Do NOT mix lemon with milk in the first one, the strawberry milk WILL curdle and clump disgustingly🤢
The water didn't 'evaporate'', it was absorbed by the noodles !
ok i admit that you filmed a tiktok and tried a makeup hack or atrend i saw it on youre tiktok account and i believe that you filmed this after finishing the tiktok that's why you're over makeupd
the day is wonderful from this moment.
Naomi you should try to make steamed egg custard 😊 And for the garlic it’s easier to bake a few heads with oil, you can squeeze the garlic out or pick it out.
Omg finally a video again I missed you so much 😭😭😭😭
Slay girl slaaaaay 💞
Vincent is so funny
Can Naomi please do my makeup or teach me her brilliant skills 😍

hwachae definitely looks a lot like sop buah : fruit soup, here in Indonesia.  but (a slightly) different in the ingredients tho, cause sop buah doesn't include any sprite in it- just milk and syrup as the water.
Thanks for the video even tho you’re busy with the tour 🫶🏻
No one makes me feel as inspired as Naomi ong
