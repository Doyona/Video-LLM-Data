Omg! Love the commercial! Nick has always reminded me of Pippen. So, him playing a Hobbit was perfect! 😅
man, Patty might be the jokester of the crew but he has been such an asset and hard worker. props to Patty!
We got a peek into Patrick's brain..I was not disappointed
My galley was an Optimus Sea Swing gimbald over the sink 😂😂😂😂
I haven't laughed that much (since your last ad) in ages. Perfect casting. Nic a better Frodo than what's his name.  So precious.
Leo, you’re a great project manager.  Tally Ho is the proof. Great work as always.
"I'm very vain".  Yes, we have all noticed with your childish looking black nail polish and constant head tossing to make sure your curls flop around.
I missed this one..I thought I watched all of your episodes. This one just popped up and I'm happy it did. the meeting brain activity   was epic...what a great crew and an amazing project. You should win boat builder of the year. I really am happy you did this for all of us non- sailor types.
as a comment to your math "i reject your reality and subjugate my own"
Massive respect for the amount of work all of you are doing!!
I don’t know what your sponsors think of your ad creation, but they are getting their monies worth for sure! These are the only ads we watch on YouTube. Everyone else’s ads, we skip past them. These are hilarious and we actually remember the products. Great job and very creative.
Uhh, Sméagol was not a hobbit, smh. He was a hobbit like creature. JRR Tolkien was very specific on that detail. He could have said he WAS a hobbit but he didn’t.
5:31 So much willpower, lesser men would have gone for such low hanging fruit without hesitation me included 😔
You and your brilliant team have wholehearted blessings and well wishes from all over the globe.
I’m so impressed by Leos multitude of skills that I watched this episode again.😊
Must be bittersweet Leo, the build is progressing faster than you could have managed on your own, but you don’t get much time to lay hands on the project which I know you love so much.  But hey, someone has to steer the ship ☮️❤️
the patrick/smeagol is pretty bit was realllly funny. I woke the house laughing at it.
so you Leo.. without Leo, just imagine. THANK YOU
ANOTHER G-R-E-A-T video!
You would think that managing the deck crew and rigging of a 200-foot yacht would be the more challenging task, but apparently running this project is really a lot.
Great video
This has been great to revisit this post. Leo, You are an amazing fella to take this project on and exicuted everything so well. Everybody here are a credit to themselves. You chose them well my friend.
Squeeze out porn at 26:50 🤪
It’s a masterclass in boatyard boatbuilding project management Mr leo
Most furniture makers I watch (black tail studios and four eyes furniture for example) say that domino's do not add any extra strength when gluing pieces together.  What are your thoughts about this?
👍👍👍
This is without doubt the most engaging Youf Tube video available !  I wait every week with bated breath for each episode because they just get better and better !🤩  The tune of The Wheels on the bus now has a face and a character that will forever be in my mind  whenever I hear it , as indeed will some of the others. The fun often wacky ad’s you are creating are just a scream 😂 I just hope the sponsor likes them as much as we all do 🤞 Don’t finish this project to quickly because I don’t want the fun to stop.. At the same time the project and the team especially Leo  have grown so much and the vessel they are building is becoming something really special and will be a spectacular sight when she is finally  completed.
Marathoning your entire saga of reconstructing history. In this video, it was possible to understand, a little, how complex and, to a certain extent, stressful it is to manage such a large project, with so many details. You have to have a massive vision of the project in the big picture and a lot of perseverance to keep going. Here in Brazil I'm watching you and your crew and wishing you continued strength and focus in such a wonderful job of reconstructing history and valuing the artisans who are with you and an art that, from what I've learned here on the channel, so few still master today. In my home town  we also have a tradition craft that very few people still work with, the construction of canoes made from a single log of a tree. The oldest who know this art, passed down from craftsman to apprentice, is gradually dying out. But it still survives with a few who are passing it on and a few who are keeping the knowledge alive. Success on your journey and keep following to see Tally Ho sail the seas.
Anyone else noticed that Leo makes up a boating term in every video?
This is the very best use of the ability of YouTube to highlite these fabulous projects and the magnificent skills they are supporting.
I'm soooo glad there are so many stand up people who can not only offer help, keep their word, and back it up with quality work! For us who can't watching, liking and subscribing will have to do. ❤ love from TX
How is this project funded? Im sure there is an episode on that part of it. Does anyone know?
Leo you're a class A person and a great boss
I started collecting links to the Tally Ho videos a couple weeks ago and began organizing them in order of episode #'s. Then suddenly, there were no more episode #'s and now I'm trying to figure out the chronology of events. Unless you can  recommend another way, Leo, I may have to go through the entire lot and try to piece things together. By the way, I love your work and I'm learning a lot about wood boat building thanks to you. And no, I haven't contributed yet. Cheers, the Buzzard.
Blue Nile does look awesome! Love this so good.
How did you get Adam Levine to work for you?
Just when I think I can’t get any more impressed see all the craft people doing what they do is simply inspiring. Great video showing the complexity, the piles of paperwork and forms which this project creates.
The real challenge of this project is getting along with Leo.
Often wondered how much time you were still able to devote to the actual hands on wood working at this point.
Youd think Machenzie Bezos would just pay you guys!! Your channel is like the best of the best of CAST Members
A tremendous insight into the backroom workings of Tally Ho. Loved the ads too.
I absolutely love the fine craftsmanship that went into this georgous vessel, well done from all those who have participated in this project. Great job Leo in orchestrating this job.
OMG, I'll never watch Lord of the Rings the same again.  Also, inb4 Samspon Cooking, cooking at sea!!
So outside its the ship inside its a very good house!!!!!😃😃😃😃
Was that g10 on the spars?
This is one of the best episodes you have released.
Another great one Leo Downunder Lindsay
Love the channel! The “Blue Nile” advert… did not realize that you were building the boat in Middle Earth!
Have not been being notified of new videos ?!!! Help !!! 💙🤔😲🖖
This video is one of your Best! Thanks for the person to person tour on task and the unscripted banter of the crew.
Alright, that was a sponsorship section I was actually happy to watch through. Bravo!
I love this channel.  I just learned about the Ship of Theseus.
It's been a fantastic evolution to watch all of the happenings on this project. The people are fun and interesting, the work has been amazing.
How much have you spent on the boat sofar
Where’d that other boat builder go?  The one with the tattoos.
Is hiring some editors not a good idea or do you need a pretty good understanding of what is going on? I guess they could still take away lots of work. Plenty of students in the world doing some editing to earn something extra. Should not be hard to find I think. Easier than skilled woodworkers I assume.
The boat is looking amazing! not sure if you have winches yet, but I have two barient 35's two speed self tailer's in annodized aluminum. They need a cleaning and overhaul. If you can use them you can have them for the shipping from Massachusetts.
Upvote for the commercial.
🤣
CANT MAKE A VIDEO WITHOUT BEGGING FOR MONEY. You’re already getting a free boat worth hundreds of thousands of dollars that you plan to ‘use for education and goodwill’.. stop crying
Phenomenal episode. Thanks!
Excellent video! Thanks for the insight.
Long time watcher here! congrats for the tenacious perseverance, truly inspiring. Question: Where do you get all your music? Cheers.
Your team have the only advertisements that I watch.  Brilliant!
Thanks guy I am millwright  and impressed with the level of Skil , millwright mac Las Vegas  nevada.!
The blue Nile add was great 😂
I think of the money companies used to pay ad companies
It is getting closer to the water every day.  btw, you mentioned that some of the workers started out as volunteers and are going through apprenticeship while working on Antebellum.  I a retired now but if i was 18 and good with my hands and detail oriented, I would seriously consider pursuing a career as a boatright. Perhaps one or all of your apprentices would care to speek to that. Thanks.
FASCINATING: We've been there, having built a wood/epoxy gaff ketch launched in 2000. I identify with all the project management stages. WELL DONE you keep us all enthralled.
We are glad the craftsmanship is far better than the acting. But still good fun, precious :)
You clowns are getting better at this advertising stuff 😂
"Today, I have been mostly eating elderberries."
I wonder if any of the newish AI tools could help you get editing done in less time 🤔
Super interesting with this kind of video 👌 definitely more of those!  Also my favourite channel to date, so might be bit biased ..
Thanks for the "behind the scenes"-style video. I really enjoyed seeing everything in the context of a day around the shop.
Keep the need for cooling on the fridge in mind.  The compressor and especially the condenser need to expel heat or they will not work right.
Thanks for posting and sharing. Your video definitely reveals the scope and complexity of what unbeknownst to you was undertaken with the start of the project.
08:28, You've got an Australian Kelpie
damn, wish I was a lottery winner, I would straight take care of this.  Not going to lie, this episode kind of stressed me out, but I was blown away to find out that everyone is being paid and it's not a volunteer supported operation anymore. Big props to everyone that volunteered and made such huge efforts towards this build.  It's so incredibly complicated to rebuild something this involved, and mind boggling expensive to outfit it with the most future-facing technology deployed by incredibly experienced and skilled builders (Joe systems and Pat furnishing). Sad to see Pete and Richard go, but the current crew is super invigorating and highly skilled for this phase (systems, deck and finishing) Best of luck Leo, this has been amazing, I am now caught up and will follow along with the rest of the addicts.
I think he is about to tear up around 13:52. which is great to see, shows how much he cares about his folks. keep it on!
Great job
Love the jewelry infomercial!😂
Das Boat by gifted woodworkers. Look at comps in other 50 footers. The priority is food, beverage, and comfort not Alice Brute Stone's 19th Century canoe club.
How much have you received and donations up to this date?
Is it not a money maker to sell merch? or is it just not enough money to 'help' with how much effort it takes to supply such a service? Because I would love to support the project in that way.
👍👍👍👍
Ideally you shouldn't show us your keys and your address.....
The whole project is coming along well great to watch . Allan from Lameroo South Australia
Would that TV commercials be so fun. Sampson wins the award in originality in You Tube sponsor bombing.
Tons of work, making jobs, keeping alive the trade skills. Showing the people and work is so rare. Keep it up much Respect Leo.
Well done on everything
One of the hardest things for me to do when I was running work was to put down the tools. Your ads are funny as hell. I usually ff through ads but yours are worth watching.  Could you get a college student to do an internship to help you make videos?
Keep up the amazing work! The work done in this project is stunning and fascinating to watch and even the ads are interesting and worth watching. I highly recommend this to everyone.
welcome to being the boss :) Make sure to take good vacations...
The heat from the oven....sapping the cooling of the fridge?
How can you loose the heat from the fridge when it is next to the stove? Thanks Keith.
Wow awesome Leo!  Lots of work going on.  Looks like you guys are making good progress. 👍👌
Is anything left of the original TallyHo on this project?
Great video! Perfect lenght!
let Patrick shoot and make an entire video. It would be insane
I’ve never confused my wife with a 600 year old hobbit - very careful to not make that mistake.  The only embedded ad that I’ve ever backed up to watch twice!!  Well done!
Interesting not in the least boring thank you. John from Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
This video hits different, it was a really awesome way to show us what your daily life actually looks like. Your video making skills have made the results really smooth and professional, but I've been wondering how the reality was like working on Tally Ho. All the best !
Never boring!
You make the best commercials I've ever seen ;)
Leo's work adding up to 125% reminds me of the 90/10 rule, after the first 90% of any project comes the last 90% :-) !!!
Great to hear about Brion Toss legacy. As a Pacific Northwest sailor I'm proud to know of the brain power of Port Townsend.  And appreciate that I was able to talk to him and get his advice.
Favorite channel. Love the project and area surroundings.
Who said Brit's don't have a sense of humor?  Speaking of which when are you going to show more work on the front door?
I just know my hubby is in heaven. Watching this. So amazing
sir what computer program did you talk about for keeping track of projects on boat. it opened like a spider web. was a year or so ago.
The only YouTube channel where I actually watch the ads and don't skip them. Would be great if we could free up Leo's time to do some wood work rather than the office work, you need an assistant.
Woow , I had no idea that take so much time, effort, energy, money, time ;) way how you introduce your daily basis open eyes for us. Thanks Leo for that what you doing!
love the ad
Amazing work keep it up Leo and crew
You deserve every bit of your success, your channel and the work being done there and in the community is uplifting. In a world gone crazy you represent a ray of hope for humanity. The boat is going to be a masterpiece.
So awesome @Leo thanks for this video. You and your team are so inspiring. Really proud to be a supporter! <3
so nice to see you having fun as well as working hard.
guess I need to watch lord of the rings to understand that add
omg the internal monologues of the team
I really like and appreciate the management/behind the scenes aspect
drawing... not draw.....ring    🙃
Your commercials  are the best. They are hilarious.
More invaluable content Leo. Have to say driving holding or using a mobile device while driving is, as I understand it illegal in the UK, France and America
Your channel is the ONLY one ...that I watch the ads on.(I pay YouTube for commercial free) I think you do a great justice to/for..your advertisement sponsor.
Great job Leo
I feel so lazy.
I just hope to see Tallyho sail into Bristol one day, A big thankyou to Leo and all the craftman that have rebuilt this Beautiful Boat, l have followed the rebuild from day one and l will certainly miss the video's  you've been making  Leo, l certainly  hope you carry on giving us updates when you finally get to sail Tallyho,  thankyou
Always fascinating Leo and the team.
Many skillful people working on many projects. Well done Leo I think you touched on them all. I can't wait for the mast, spars & rigging, that will be SO interesting. That's when it will look like Tally Ho.
Ventilation for the reefer compressor?
please hire someone to help you with the admin Leo
I have NEVER not skipped an ad on YouTube i couldn't block, until now :) you guys could rewrite the rules of advertising!! Genius 😂
Leo your work ethic and dedication are exemplary.  I think Toyota should advertise on your channel since you drive a Tundra. Cheers
Leo, is it not a proposition to hire a manager/Financial manager? For paperwork? (Probably been asked and answered before)
Is not just recording lite video its hard work to do such great videos thanks for it leo and crew
Smiggle is beautiful 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Leo, you would haft to give a camera to each person to cover this epic build.
OMG - wheels on the bus. Sorry I laughed so loud, but I also can't stop
The enduring appeal at the heart of this channel is the people. The ads, behind the scenes, road trips to view boats, shops etc makes little difference as long as we're in the company of Leo and crew.
The longer the better! Greetings from the Netherlands!
I've been fitting out a 60ft x 12.6 widebeam in the UK for the last year on my own and this really gives me inspiration everytime I watch these episodes. I didn't start with any skills but watching the crew take their time and really put alot of love into this project is amazing. Building a boat is no joke. Can't wait to see this project on the water. 🎉
https://youtu.be/UzYHO4tksTc for the propeller
So many wishes, in life. I wish for you to know, my appreciation for those that can help you. This show inspires me, I'm sure so many more. Thanks to all that makes this possible. 😊
So happy to see the hobbit references!  Nothing Middle Earth about this project, no dragons but just pure gold!!
Awesome behind-the-scenes video Leo. You and your wonderful (and playful) team are masters of your crafts. Acting? Meh!😆😆😆😆😆 (Really, I love it).😂
Where's the parrot?
This is a boat the best project video series on youtube.
I’m gonna miss this when the boat is done
WOW, I did not realize how many people worked on this project at one time. Thanks for the insight. I love this project and I am excited to see the Tally Hoe sail for the first time.
My Grandfather used to run a company near Glasgow that may even have made the original ropes, Gourock Ropeworks. I live in Stranraer now and hope you will visit SouthWest Scotland in your eventual travels.
Netflix should have optioned you guys from day 1.
thank you to everyone that can support
Leo tells us that it takes about an hour to produce one minute of finished video. That’s a huge amount of his valuable time. Wouldn’t it be possible for one of us to step up and volunteer to do this part of the project? I wonder if the editing could be done from somewhere other than Port Townsend.  Isn’t there someone out there, one of the many of us who love these videos, that could do this work for Leo?
Teak Gutter!!!! Awesome!
What fun to be able to glimpse a more personal look at your team! They are successful because of friendship, common goals and great leadership! Thanks for an amazing video. Be well, be safe!
Hey Leo, I've been wondering lately if you regret leaving your old workshop and moving to port townsend?  It's certainly more expensive.
Hey man this is without doubt the best YouTube content out there and if I had a spare million I would 100 percent give it to this project ! Alas I am skint.
All of the videos of the project are entertaining and educational and this was no exception. OFC the woodwork for me is the most enjoyable, in particular the complex joints and angles required on certain parts. The amount of knowledge and skills held by all the crew knocks me out. I am looking forward to seeing the rigging and how it works, being a landlubber it is a complete mystery.
Cool video! I think that from time to time especially in such long lasting project it is very important to have some behind the scenes. I love the mix of themes you come up to us - some technical, some more chill, behind the scenes, explaining what is what on the ship - it is fresh, there is no boring repeating parts and the quality of the video is awesome! Like really top notch with catching all the important parts... I can't imagine how much time setting all cameras can take and how hard is to plan and manage it. Thanks for sharing <3
keep up the great work..too all
Liked the blue Nile “commercial”
I can sense something ominous in this here vidya… and I don’t like it.  Listen here Tallyho crew, and you listen closely, you guys are badass and you’re completing an epic project. The dude with the sophisticated accent; we know you stay busy. F@ck who or whatever is making you act like a pig during this edit. The guy who is working on the galley is very funny, keep it up honkey. Keep on keepin on crew, f@ck the man! - Chainsaw
One of my favourite things about this series is how far Patrick has come with his skills and workmanship. Great to see.
A teak gutter. The salty equivalent of a golden toilet? 😊
Enjoyed this edit
Thank you
Algoritmo
Leo no sabes como siento no entebder tus comentarios mi ingles es escaso y seguro son muy interessantes añadir subtitulos en español  estaria miy bien un saludo admiro tu trabajo
Great content (as always), best YouTube channel there is.
Nice
Thanks for another great video.
Talk a lot
Crikey Leo,Tally Ho Inc.has turned into a well oiled machine,your crew are incredible and you are doubly incredible.thank you.
Kudos to you and your team for a job well done.  Loving the advertising.👍🇺🇦👍🇺🇦
Best ads on youtube😅😂😂
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H97T3I3uWVY
Even before I heard Leo say he's assigning the cap rail construction and installation to himself I was expecting that to be a future highlight of the build. Now I'm super anxious to see what he has in mind and how it becomes a reality.
SHIRTS! I would absolutely buy one if you sold some
A superb boat , but where is tallyho
😊
Great video not boring.
That's funny....u fellows shipwrights?
Good merch is a win for everyone involved.
PS STOP THAT
WTH
Leo, I have watched every one of your videos since day one, and I this is my very first comment. Never stop. I am in midlife with a wonderful wife and four kids ages 6 - 14, and you inspire me in in every way. I work hard and can't wait for the newest Tally Ho update, I love woodworking and sailing with a passion, but your crew, their work, and your way of highlighting the key points give me the inspiration to keep pushing. I work in a non-descript government job pushing paperwork, and watching your videos gives me hope that someday I might circumnavigate when my time comes. Your perseverance is exceptional, and I know it has been an undertaking with doubts and extreme uncertainty.  I know you know it will be worth it in the end; many people are living vicariously through you. From North Carolina, thank you, brother! -Ben
Absolutely !!! You DEFINITELY have been doing some "pretty amazing things" since the very beginning when you were in someones back yard alone and/or with a volunteer crew !!!  You have done a very nice job illustrating the "craft and skill" that has been applied throughout this build. Please do something that no-one who provides videos on YouTube ever does. Please do one video that shows everyone exactly what it takes to make and edit a YouTube video like yours. As you say, one hour for each minute of final footage means that process rivals any of the "craft" achievements. Understand, I'm not in ANY WAY diminishing ANY of the craft/skill work as it ALL is so "over the top" extraordinary" !!! Particularly, since I am a 80 year old trades worker who was taught "work ethic" and only one philosophy ------------ "Do it right, or don't do it at all" !!!   Obviously, your entire crew are very "PROUD" of their work as anyone with ANY CRAFT EXPERIENCE would expect !!!  👍👍👍👍👍🛠⚙🔩🔨🗜🖖✌❤❤🍺
Really insightful as to what it takes to get a project to run. Over the years Leo you have developed remarkably (in boat building and management skills) and it is a delight to see what is taking place. Bravo!
Amazing project and well organized.
Fantastic videa, great ad  - you have such a talented crew. I am so impressed with how you have blended experience and new talent to build their skills through paid apprenticeships. Humbling to watch, let alone be the leader of such a band! Well done all 👏👏👏
Every time a highlight for me, thanks!
Honestly I'd love to see a whole episode that is just integrated ads and their outtakes. Just do 1 big spar fundraising episode with a bunch of sponsors, it'd be hilarious and would help out the project. You've got a very entertaining group of folks working with you!
❤😂👍
I'm always an advocate of knee and toe space under a bathroom basin, so that you can get directly over the basin without banging your knees on a cabinet.
And there we have it I have caught up, taken me about 2 months. A truly inspiring channel, not just for the quality of the craftsmanship from the very start but all things boat.  I’ve been sailing for about 3 years on and off with a mate, but recently I have booked a trip on a gaff rigged trawler from 1880, about to buy my first sail boat, got myself a pair of bib and brace overalls and identified a local boat yard with a wooden boat restoration that I can volunteer on to help with a transition to becoming a shipwright. Thank you Leo and Tally Ho!
Your adds are the only ones I never skip. While advertising  its a short comedy skit. It's great
What a great look into you hard work and the great community you have created....Well done sir......
Lots of stuff on the go! Its coming together; just needs the final push-through now.
I'm just here for the adverts 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Do you already have a ship inspector planned in the agenda?
Wow, Leo, I don`t know a thing about shooting video or editing,  1 hr of editing for one minute of video, that`s insane, just managing this project is a full time job, let alone the hours of editing, it`s crazy what you have going on.I thought the crew was unpaid, great to hear they are all shipwrights being paid, I thought they worked for free, I was thinking, these are the greatest people in the world, what a task, what a crew, I am always amazed.
I for one think that our adds actually enrich your videos Leo :D
Trust me, project management, good project management, is one heck of a job. As you said you have to do the calling, designing, bug working out, drawing of pictures, then describing what is in the pictures. Making sure the people are there, they have what they need, they know what is the task at hand. I did Project Management for a number of years and while it was never dull it was sometimes maddening. I don't envy you, but you do seem to be doing a good job of it. Hang in there Mate! Then some days you wind up with some guy asking who you are and what it is you do and he works for you.
GREAT VIDEO !!!    Thanks for your efforts!
I have to add my voice to the growing chorus pleading with you to set up some merchandise for sale. We all would jump at the chance to own something or other marked with that gaff cutter TH. It seems like a sure bet to help counter your increasing expenses.
Might be that this is asked before but I was wondering how independently people do things for the project. Do you design and ponder together all joints, srew placements, work steps or does builder do own decisions too when building independent parts like cabinet door etc.?
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
The sponsorship segments have taken these already fantastic videos to the next level😆
Leo, this was a really good video.  I was gobsmacked at the total crew.  Your hourly rate on this project must be through the roof!  Tally Ho will be the most beautiful museum piece afloat.
I love love love this style of video
thank you, sir. A nice look into the day to day
Where's Richard?
Ah, a bronze basin! Nice! I would forget about the vanity cabinet below and have just the basin floating (maybe a small wooden counter around it). It's strong enough for any application and the idea of using old beautiful things is just all-around good.  Aloha 🤙
You have assembled a hardworking crew that appears to have a lot of fun.  Thanks for the glimpse of a day-in-the-life of the Tally Ho crew.  I can see that you do spend 125% of your days working to make this all happen.  Thanks for the video.
9:14 blue tape beard is best, nice try patricksmeagel
Leo, don't be too hard on yourself, you and your crew are doing a fantastic job. making real progress to the highest standards, and by the look of it having fun.  Keep the videos coming what I'll have to watch when Tally Ho is complete goodness knows.
Bruce was a treat! Love these old men, getting excited about a great piece of old wood.
I'd watch this channel for just the off-the-wall adverts! Getting funnier every time - and it's all very informative about carpentry. Best wishes from SE London!
Love it. Keep it up and thanks for sharing.
I just Cannot get enough of these videos. Consider uploading long form videos of single builds. I would watch a 3h + build of anything if the camera is mounted at an okey angle. Perhaps that would be extra youtube income for a low amount of extra work?
I'm always amazed at how much this channel has grown and how much dedication you and the crew have put into rebuilding Tally Ho. The editing is amazing! I hope one day I can support the project with more than just the views and the likes.
Having PM'd some 8 digit industrial projects, you're doing an amazing job Leo. Keep it up, don't forget to breath, and don't forget to take stock of the amazing things you've accomplished.
KEXP!
Oh your ads are so enjoyable!!
Odd but this is how I judge how long I’ve been sober, started watching you and Joe Rogan at the beginning of my sobriety.  Absolute dream job is to be around water and vessels
I am able to appreciate premium grade sea worthy carpentry, thanks to your video.  This series spills onto the culturally and socially relevant realm, as a project record.  I have picked the series up during 2020 lockdown, and shall follow with you to the last episode!  Bravo!
The only sponsored ads I love to watch.
I wonder if Leo knows that as soon as Tally Ho is in the water, he will have to buy another ancient wooden boat and start fixing it so that us loyal followers don't riot in the streets?
Gotta imagine that Leo just thinks to himself "someday, all I'll have to do is sail her... and film it"
Leo and team great work love the video intro 😂 the boat is coming along great...
Fantastic Video Leo, great to see how it all works behind the scenes
the black fingernails?
Flog the rig and sail plans to raise money mate, they would look ace framed.
thanks for the great vids , a joy
Very interesting indeed! Thank you for sharing your highs and lows. It is all an important part of the story! Please remember to take a bit of time for yourself now and then. Stop "cutting" for a bit and take time to "resharpen" yourself, so to speak. Wishing you and the crew all the best from the upper midwest!
"You are the vanity master"..."Yes...I'm very vain". LOL. So many clever funny folks working on this project. <3
Watched I think all of your rebuild video's. May have lost the idea of what she will be used for after completed and who will be the owner.
Great video. Bit at the end so fucking funny haha.
(Not clickbait )  I’m here to tell you Leo, I hate surveys,adds on any search engine, or websites, hate commercials and fast forward through all YouTube adds. But your adds are the ONLY ones that I sit and watch, and sometimes look forward to!!  Keep it up, wish you well and safe journeys when you get there.
Thank you so much for this enormous work....
Crack on lads from Australia. Brilliant to see such craftsmen and women at work. Cheers from Australia.
I super enjoy your integrated adds.  So funny.
I love that, with all the work you’re doing, you’re making career development a priority. Good on you.
I look forward to seeing your work every time. ❤❤❤❤
Very interesting. Thx.
Clifton telling us viewers not to touch the wet sealant…
You do know Hobbit’s don’t like boats right?😜
These ads keep getting better and better!
Having hand carved repair pieces for vintage car ash frames for a living, I know how complex and time consuming carpentry is. But carpentry is only part of a restoration and the time and costs very easily spiral. Where I come from "mony a mickle maks a muckle". If you like Tally Ho, send Leo as many "mickles" as you can. No matter how small, they all add up to the "muckle" that Leo needs to keep going and keep us all enthralled. Go on.
😂 that’s the best fucking advert I’ve ever seen 😂😂😂
Right from when I started watching these videos, I've been in awe of the perseverance of you and the amount of help you've managed to attract, Leo. Every step of the way, from building the shed in your friends backyard (which the council people approved after inspection, what a win that was!) and moving around those huge timbers that made up the spine of the ship, to where you are now. It's been an amazing journey, and thank you for taking us on it :) I learn so much and get so much inspiration, this is great.
I had to stop watching just to come straight to the comments cause it was about the funniest commercials you guys have done. The beard that Erica wore was priceless with hair looking chop messy and some not even attached.
What a project-and great community.
:)
I really liked this a bit different styled video. Thanks Leo! Greetings from Germany 🇩🇪
Always wanting to know what glues and sealants are being used in construction
I have a suspicion that if you had a naval valuer visit Tally Ho for an insurance valuation that the vessel as it is now, may well be valued around USD$5,000,000.00  I wonder how close I am with my guesstimate vis a vis the actual insurance valuation?
Very very interesting Leo. You have a great team!
Come for the boatbuilding, stay for the integrated ads.
Patrick is an absolute fool. He's an embarrassment to your channel
It's a fantastic video Leoh it's a great show I love your candid approach to boats and the construction.  Thankyou
Interesting to see behind the scenes on a typical day for the team. BTW the quality of these videos is excellent but I did not realise the editing took about an hour per minute! Wow
I've laughed watching the videos before, but this one was hilarious. Thank you :D
The comments are chock full of superlatives I totally endorse.  Leo, you are quite the most remarkable person and deserve all the accolades and then some.  Just a superb achievement by one and all.  A zero cost help is simply for the other 250K viewers to hit the like button.  Go on, just do it.
Thanks for creating this community!
I liked thaht Video
Another great video. Fantastic work by all!
Your work attention to detail and work environment are amazing.  I wish you and your team amazing success from New Zealand.
It's cute how his fingernail polish matches the color of his hair
This project is an excellent example of how crowd funding and largely volunteer labour can be used in a positive way. Creating outcomes that are superior in every way to well funded corporate or government projects. So generous of Leo and everyone involved to share their vision and hard work.
Aye, it's lonely at the top, Leo. As the ice hockey goalie (almost!) said, "The buck stops here." 🏒🥅👀
The ads are the best part.
I’ve watched every minute of every episode and still can’t get enough! Thanks for making my weekend twice a month Leo and Team!
What happened to Richard?
Obvious for years that this would be next level and showcase the auspicious birth of the Sampson Boat Company should Leo so desire. What discerning person wouldn't want him building their boat? Hopefully we'll still get to follow his achievements when he sets up shop in the UK.
I've watched this channel off and on for a few years. Great stuff that you would never think about otherwise. Great people doing great things. But one question keeps coming to mind...  Who will own this boat in the end?
MODEM carrier signal was LOL funny! And "Wheels on the Bus" omg the best. :)
Seeing the coordination of energy and effort is terriffic. It takes a real master to keep so many people all working in close proximity and often overlapping space working so efficiently and effectively. This is a great building crew and hopefully all will be able to be on board for her maiden voyage
We all have all the time that there is…and if we make use of it effectively to accomplish our life’s goals we can come to the other end of our life without regrets.  …or so it says in the fine print.
Just commenting to help the algorithm along. Fantastic series as always!
Go go Tally Ho!
Smegal is pretty
"Challenging" hahaha typical Englishman and their way of understating things.  Mate that is more than challenging, it's enormous, gigantic, massive, humungous, overwhelming, incredible, unbelievable, it truly is an enormous undertaking and definitely not for the feint of heart. But the end result will be amazing, a brand new old boat, with new engine, new everything ready to travel the world. I do hope you make it down here to Oz and our wooden boat festival in Tasmania, I reckon there'd be a win if you enter Tally Ho
interesting:)
I wish I could like it twice.
Great video you all are an amazing team! Your commercial is hilarious but good too!
yes keep it up!
Shadoune :D
top tier
Good to see Pat, he has hardly aged. He was a instructor of mine back in '98 at the boat school, I learned a lot  and still work on wooden boats
Regarding your closing comments about the project going in a direction you never imagined, I would love to hear you expound on the things you DID imagine and what’s better now because of the channel. For example I remember the original ship had iron (steel?) floors and knees, but because of the channel you made the decision to cast them in bronze.  When I see things go in like welded aluminum tanks, I often wonder if that’s “standard” and what you would have done anyway, or “luxury” because of the channel.  What about the mast and spars? Would you have just used an old telephone pole or something? Or, maybe it’s simply all about having a hired crew to help you?
So cool to see this video on the trending page! Let’s get this channel to 1 million subscribers.
One of my favorite videos from my favorite channel..
Incredible
Leo - every minute was interesting - thanks
Your're one of my better investments.
At an hour a minute, I feel guilty now if I click off of the video 30 seconds early when Leo says “that’s about it for me”.
The wheels on the bus bahaha
I am a very different kind of rigger (entertainment and rope access), so I can't wait for more details about Tally Ho's rig. How exciting!
Leo,.I hesitate to say anything as you do not know me and therefore I'm not sure it will mean that much to you, but I'm so proud of this project and cannot believe what you have been able to accomplish.Your skill is only surpassed bu your humility and your tenacity. Keep up the good work!
Modesty and sincerity goes way much further than dubious behavior.
29:52 That *is* a really nice gutter.
You adverts keep getting better. I would have a seperate playlist of just them available for viewing.
So a couple of thoughts. In addition to the pure charisma of Leo and his crew, consider the editing. I subscribe to multiple sailing channels and this one flows the best. Not too long on one task, nor too short. This all in the hands of a guy that is extremely busy and no doubt overwhelmed at times. I can only say that in my opinion he is so extremely talented in many ways.
Great video thanks for taking us behind the curtain! Very interesting to see how the project is run and the amount of folks and time it takes!
May I just say, best Blue Nile pitch ever.
Leo, recording a video while driving is a violation in Washington. Be careful.
proper word use is nick and I.
The movie was very interesting. Thanks to it, you can see even more the enormity of work, which actually increases over time. As you can see, the work is getting more and more complex and laborious. Hence, more people work on it permanently. I've been watching your channel from the beginning. All your people are very cool and obviously professional and your ads are gems of cinematography ;)))
CONTENT WAS GREAT!
Yes, I like this episode - driving around town bits and all. ;) As always, good luck with continued financing... that main mast spar is impressive! I'll continue contributing via Patreon.
Interesting and enjoyable! Keep up the fine work!!!
epic
Best ad yet!
How much revenue from YouTube do you make for each 30 minute video?
Do you guys plan on building boats together after tally ho is finished? Looks like a great group!👍👍
How tall are you Leo?
Will any of them become part of the crew Tally Ho?
Just curious, I was wondering why Nick paints his nails? It doesn't match the rest of his look.
Loving your videos. Even the ads are something I look forward too! 😂❤
I bet after this is done you will wanna start again. The best part is the build for most of use project people
That beard 😂
That's a strong cup of tea
This channel deserves more subscribers. It has such a great content even if you have no interested in boat building like me.
And, speaking for myself, I am very grateful for the amount of attention and sheer grit that goes into producing these episodes. I love the crew and their ability to poke fun at the whole thing, and themselves! Really, one of the best sailing/boatbuilding channels on YouTube. Kudos to you all!
Hey Leo, Whats your projected net cost for Tally Ho? loved this style of episode, very interesting.
B.N. commercial on par with the Fight of the Concords music video.
An amazing bunch of people working so well together on an amazing project.
Do Tally Ho hoodies or merch. Yet more work on the list of jobs but I'm sure it can be outsourced.
Man I love this series, the heart behind everything is awe-inspiring.
Leo, the busy man, you need to spend time with your family also, mm.
Its like watching an episode of Mrs Doubtfire.. Patrick is Cliffton, who would have guessed, fantastic editing Leo..
will you say how much it cost at the end
Every video is a highlight.  The atmosphere of joy that is so often highly evident is probably key to overwhelming success thus far.Tally Ho is a story of a Ship to be sure, but each inch of her is the prose of a person, a craftsman breathing life into Tally Ho  and the way you bring these moments to light is the enduring magic that I thirst for,
integrated ads are usually very lighthearted and funny, so if your boat building career fails..... get a job with U Tube doing adverts. As for the rest of the video, it's all interesting and we know we'll be catching up with the skilled "tool work" at some point. Having spent a few years building and configuring PC's I cannot get the interest going in the editing of vids for publication, so for Leo to do that as well as tool work, and the office is quite admirable.
Great effort to show what your crew is doing to breathe life into the boat. Teak gutter..booyah!
You are an amazing guy Leo.
Leo - a boat builder and a sailor.   You should not ever complain about how much you work when you are the captain.  You are so fortunate to have such great people with you all along the way.  I believe you know that.  Yes, it’s long hours and some times a pain in the ass to do what is not your passion. Yet it’s the rest of everybody that has made your dream.  Just don’t say the quiet parts out loud.
You are sick dudes x
I know its been a while but what year did this project start in the other house ?
My favorite thing is the love of design. But I can't deny how closely I am watching the team building, and work management aspects of this thing. It looks like it's really working, whilst still respecting everyone.
😂😂😂 love the ad
Reckon you should just jack it in and get a job driving a mini cab in Preston.
Meeting montage...the best, Thanks for that!
Great video Leo! Keep going!
nice ! )
😉🙂👍🏾
The team meeting with the voiceovers was great.  I hadn't realized George was a droid, but it checks out lol.  Keep up the Great work guys!
Feels like we are finally in the home straight. A launch in Autumn this year? A total of seven years since Leo purchased the boat. Which is enough out of a lifetime. What a transformation. Surely Tally Ho was never originally built to anything like the level of work that Leo and the team have done! It is a privilege to be a Patreon contributor.
Normally I fast forward through the commercials (sponsors). But yours are actually worth watching.
Leo..its not incredible that your project is being handsomely funded...in fact it is accredited to the teams skill..thus accredited 🎇 flying a submarine would be incredible🎈
I love this video, great insight in the project!
Excellent as usual. I laughed out loud at the ad, and I raise my hat to the carpentry of you fellows, I thought I was okay at woodwork, but I wouldn't qualify to sweep your floor.
Fascinating, that's what that was. Oh, and funny too.
Leo! You sir are an absolute inspiration!  If I were 20 years younger, I would have loved to have partaken in any and all work on this beautiful project. It sends me way back to a time when I was but a lad and helped rebuild not only the last flying Short Sunderland but also rebuild an old catamaran (icarus). I am now in my fifties and bogged down in IT work, but man.....I would have loved to help! I hope to maybe see the end result and to sail on her if funds permit. You're all doing an awesome job...thank you so much!!
Hi Leo as always flabergasted with the vid. Very informative and yes a lot going on. What i liked about the early vids was the time spent on details of woodworking, like setting up the shipright saw and other stuff like that. More or less an in depth how to. Its something i am missing a bit. Like with this episode one of the guys was doing repairs on defects in oak (?) wood. Would be great if you can do a special on general techniques used in the manufacturing/crafting process. But hey maybe i am just a nerd who likes detail. Thanks for keeping up the great work.
One hell of a job! But the result will be fabulous!
How much of the boat is still original? Genuine question.
Galley is huge!  I had no idea there were so many people. That's a large crew for Leo to manage.
Everyone’s thoughts had me cracking up, especially “the wheels on the bus” lol XD also loved the ad as always!
Oooh Pat's dovetails.... so glad we got to see them go together!
Your “commercials” are the only ones I watch. Well done
I have seen all your episodes. I am very impressed with your construction and your professional skills! You are not only a skilled craftsman, you convey it very well in these videos.. Thank you
Ok, the Blue Nile commercial-skit is one for the books. What a creative and skilled crew you have, the commercial made my day. Sampson Boat Company just keeps on delivering some of the best content on YouTube. It will be a shame when it all ends however all the content will remain for many to appreciate in the future. As a result of this steller advertising, I will probably order my wife something for our next anniversary.  Thanks for this Leo and crew, keep the Sampson Boat Company machine running, your impending launch will be a great event... Joe
omg!!!
That ad was amazing
Outstanding sponsor ad. Blue Nile got their moneys worth.
Hi Leo. Thank you for the birds eye view of your entire business/team. This ticks all the boxes for me. Coming from a project management back round in construction i always wondered how you coped. People, skills required, infrastructure/premises available, time lines, commercial/finance management, planning, design, authenticity, cash flow management etc. you covered it all in one episode. Amazing effort by you and team
I am very impressed that you have been able to transition volunteer labour into paid labour. Offering experience to volunteers is always good, but being paid for it gives a greater sense of  value of the work.  I am also impressed by the description of the joinery.  I suspect that much more simple joints would be sufficient, but the elegance of the joints being made ensure the boat will be not just capable but a object of practical art.
Great video Leo. The nitty gritty of what it take to do what you are up to.  Go hard Man .
We should pool some money and hire Leo an administrative assistant, video editor, or whatever of his many roles takes up the most of his time that he'd like back so he can have more fun building stuff (assuming that's what he wants).
This project sure has grown form the early days of you and Pancho in a plastic sheet shed!
Great work you guys, lord of the rings but had me rolling.
So you make a POD, (plan of the day)  as I remember fr0m my  Navy days, the POD last maybe until maybe lunch time. SNAFU is the way things go.    Improvise! takes over.
3:06 roflmao XD
In all my years on sailboats, I have NEVER seen a Farmhouse Sink (6:31)in gallery before.  Looks a little heavy for a sailboat?  Guess you could always use it as a spare anchor if you need an extra one 🤔
I have experienced that feeling of managing a project and farming out a job only to find out that the finance has been given away by the sales force. I can only imagine how worrying it must be when it is your money making up the shortfall.
I love the integrated ads lol. They're such a silly but fun addition to the channel.
Wish I could put TWO thumbs up....that was hilarious about the morning meeting and what everyone was REALLY thinking during it....
amazing
⭐🙂👍
Definitely INTERESTING. Thank you.
Like the traditional look winches, hope the innards (Springs and Pawls) are of a standard design.
I can’t get enough of this project. What a journey it has been for you, Leo. From the rotting, beached hull to now is incredible. Stay healthy and strong. cheers!
Enjoyed this episode, had no idea so many craftspeople were involved at this time. Thanks.
Following this fantastic wood work project since years ago from across the globe....  Hats off to all the skilled crew members; and no worry Leo, this video was also interesting to understand the planning, editing and admin work needed.
Outside of passion, the project makes little to no sense.  It’s really not a re-build, most is new boat.
Very interesting!
An excellent video! The work that is going on is awe-inspiring. What a boat this is going to be. Good luck for the future!
This among my most favourite YouTube channels. Apart from the fact I live less than 20 miles from the original town of Shoreham in the south of England where Tally Ho was built in 1910, it’s just I’m blown away with the wood working/boat building skills that Leo and his team have to return this iconic boat to the water. I so look forward to every video that’s released to see the progress. My hat off to all of you keeping these valuable crafts alive 👏
Love it keep it up as always 💘
Leo, you have the best ads on Youtube.
Your ship's carpenters do a fantastic job with joinery.
My wife and I were vacationing in Port Townsend a couple of weeks ago and Leo walked in the restaurant we were dining in. It was very nice to meet him. Love the humor in your videos, Leo!
Basically every morning meeting... ever 😂
The commercials are better than the super bowl.  I wish you did these sooner
I have to say that NOTHING about the work in these videos is boring, thank you for showing all that goes into a build like this.
thank you
Watched from day one, it wa such a small chanell and i remember how big the project gonna become, and from there to here it  was quite a journey and channel is now huge, happy for Leo ^^
These Videos are a lot of Things but never boring ! A fantasic Journey how to build a Saling Ship with Passion Joy and some Times even with big Problems My Respect to Leo and the Crew !
the precision woodworking starting at 16:02 -16:29 made this video for me.
For the first time in a long time, I have read down through the comments on this video and I have realised that an awful lot of people really love your video style, the same as I do. I don't quite think you realise how important this episode is going to be in this series. It encapsulates all of the strands of this mighty project in a short nutshell of clips and statements and the comments show you have a strong following. More power to you Leo. 125% is what it makes to do something like this - most people could never come close, even on a good day, never mind the years you have committed to. Best wishes to you and all of the crew.
You would think that with so many handy people and tools in the boat shed, someone could've tightened the loose screw in Patrick's head :)
A master class on effective project management!  A little waterfall, a little agile, crisp status updates, daily stand up meeting to coordinate, some experimentations and proof of concept to test designs, issues/risk management, stakeholder communications - all without micromanaging.  I don't know much about the outstanding construction Leo does (other than appreciating its beauty), but I do know project management and he is the perfect team lead in every way!!
Don't worry about interesting Leo; it's ALL interesting. I am also heartened to see that there are folks interested in keeping alive the great traditions and crafts which go along with sailing, building, and maintaining wooden boats.
All those years of work and now Peter Jackson owns your boat😄😆😅😂🤣
The commercials are the best part!!!
why does nick have to have painted nails ?????
Rather unfortunate that someone would pledge support then go radio silent.
I loved the joinery. I was watching some Japanese and other eastern joinery channel some time back and made me wonder. Someone with those skills level could probably do a lot of  the inside and outside job with no mails needed. I don't how much longer it might take, but building cabinets, furniture and even outdoors sturdy structures was amazing. Again, it would be like building a puzzle while building a boat, but two nails on a bridge? That's mind-blowing.
BEING LAYED UP IN BED FOR MONTHS AND HAVING BEEN WITH YOU FROM THE BEGINNING IM GOING TO WRITE ANOTHER CHECK KNOWING ANY MAN NEEDS THE MONEY TO DO A COMMERCIAL AS BAD AS THIS ONE. FINALLY CROSSED THE LINE.🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂😂
You guys really make the best commercials 😂
Really fun watching this project over the last 3 years. Appreciate everyones hard work!
You lot should go on tour with a revue show. Hilarious!
😂 the paid promotion parts are so much fun! Great work guys!
A great video Leo, thanks for sharing the detailed planning and outstanding work.
Great to see who’s doing what, but who’s doing the front door?
I was so sad for Leo that he has such limited time for actual hands on crafting. The sponsor videos are great, and the money that his dream is generating to keep this project moving forward is magical.
Is this team build around gey men? I really DONT mind, just wondering😎❤️
I like the layout or style of this video a lot more than the typical video. ADITL style videos or more blog style videos are more interesting than a scripted video with footage of people working. I would like to see this style more in the future
The 25% will be forced in, causing other things to suffer, because I would not want to completely withdraw from something I love😁
Can I buy a large print of the rigging plan?  I have the perfect spot on my wall for some new framed art.....
I can’t wait for the launch.  Great work as always Leo.
Best blue Nile advertisement ever.  They should use that during the super bowl
Such a great video!! Well done!!
Trabajo la madera aunque solo hago muebles, pero es muy agradable ver como trabajáis y me doy cuenta del buen ambiente que tenéis en vuestro trabajo, seguid como hasta ahora y a disfrutarlo cuando esté acabado!!!
That really is a nice gutter. :)
What a great bunch of craftsmen and personalities working on this project!!  It will be a sad day when work is done and Tally-Ho skedaddles off into the wide blue yonder.  Perhaps there will be a squeakquel of Lord of The Strings when the rigging is complete :)  How IS Stumpy these days?
Do you still think you are 2 years away from the maiden voyage?
What s about the hole in the front?
Quite a lot of work, especially in terms of fast track project management. Amazing job done congratulations Tally Ho Team and Leo.
Amazing very skilled people you have on the project and around the port.
hell yes cant wait to see more
Glad to see that you are keeping some of the old crafts alive Leo and writing actual cheques!
I love your recent integrations! The BBC re-enactments are hilarious… if it can get you extra money, good for you!
I thought we were going to check out some WENCHES! 😫
Best integrated ads on the Internet!
Been watching from the start of this project and since then it has always been my favourite channel. I still get the same excitement every time I see the notification of a new video.
Very interesting and insightful. What a bunch of very talented and super nice people
Not at all boring at all. I found it very informative. Thank you.
Blue Nile commercial is so cool.
I can't believe you don't have over a million subs. This is an incredible story and the work is superior to any I've seen. When I think about my wood working skills I realize I'm just a wood hack.
I really like this style of video, reminds me of the videos from Martin from @Wintergatan with his marble machine. If the work amount isn’t more for this style don’t hesitate on doing it more often.   I especially liked some of the portrait shots today, have you got a new Len’s or something.  Keep up the amazing work, as a cabinetmakers apprentice I allways really happy when I see that kind of high quality woodworking. This channel is my favourite on YT!
Thanks for another great video, yes different but still entertaining. The commercials are fun in the way you do it and maybe you should have a word with Carhartt, since you are making great contents for them, maybe they could “reverse “ engineer it, and use Tally Ho as part of their advertising campaign. Style “ Making it Happen “ Cause that’s what you do!
That is the nicest teak gutter i've ever seen
How is it that Leo didn’t get apart in the ad! He looks more Hobbity than all of them?😂
Loved this video! So great to get more of a raw video. Personally, I love the more honest, raw, uncut shots of building and stuff. I would take more length and un-edited content of the building in the videos. But I appreciate it's hard to please everyone 😊
Great video, thank you for sharing
I want to know how you film these, does each of your team manipulate the camera to film themselves or do you set them up yourself ? Great content as always !
There is nothing boring about this video Leo
The fact that you pumping out a video every two weeks without a fail for so many years now alone is an outstanding achievement and shows in essence your work ethic. I dread the day the boat is done …
Always proving there are levels to.. everything. Love the video idea, shows it could be fun to deviate from the standard format from time to time. Your ads are making me belly laugh more and more each time, as well. Great work!
Will Leo eventually sail away to never be heard from again, or will he expand his YT channel to include life after launching (like all of the other sailing vlogs)?  We all want to know!  What do y'all think, folks?  Care to comment, Leo?
Great video! Look forward to you documenting your voyages in the not too distant future, maybe?
Leo awesome progress! Ads on your channel are the only ads I fully watch! The level of acting pull me in all the time. Your sponsors are lucky I hear every word😳😃🤣 craftsmanship is top notch! 👍👍👍
I really enjoy the working/boat building of this channel. I have picked up some great knowledge. My most favorite part of this channel now are the commercials. It's fun and funny. Thank you for making me laugh😅
Super interesting!
Awesome video!  Your team and their work is totally amazing.  Kudos to all of you.  :o)
This videos really speaks to your bravery Leo, of the accepted challenge once you paid one dollar for Tally Ho, without knowing exactly how it was going to happen. You and your crew(s) have done a beyond amazing job to get where you are now. 👏
Thoroughly enjoyable video--the crew has a great spirit congrats
i'm a miserable bug^er most of the time 😕 never watch comedies - boring!! This episode, gave me my first🥵 belly laugh - I had to pause to finish laughing, unbelievable 😁😁
I prefer these more meta episodes. I too am a sailor and a boat builder, and while I can enjoy watching chips peel off timbers, those shots become tedious unless contextualized within the larger project. I am also a designer and a filmmaker who is most fascinated by the evolution of this grassroots reality media genre. I suspect the attention you pay to the filmmaking and conceptual underpinnings of your project are important factors in your success.
When I first found you, I binged watched every episode until I caught up. Now, I wait impatiently every week for your updates. This series is amazing and so informative. Your crew are amazingly talented in every aspect of what they do. Thanks for sharing.
I would like to send some provisions for you and your staff if you could give me your mailing address.
how come you lot have not done a bud lite meme yet
Bummer to hear about the spar funding - That's twice that people have offered backing and then failed to come through.  Feels bad for Leo but he's such a determined character that I'm sure he'll find a way.
I can relate to the "Dial up" dude. 😜
Very interesting episode. Had lost track of how many people are now working on this project. Also a good reminder of just how much effort goes into putting these videos together. Things have certainly come long way since just you and Pete were the whole team.
superb video this week. what cameras and editing software do you use? The quality is really good. I look forward to seeing the mast and spas being prepared. Keep pushing and when finished and you go to UK with Tally Ho I sure hope that you will go to Cannes / St Tropez area as Tally Ho needs a holiday.
👍
They deserve an Oscar!
Very good. Shows what happens day to day.
I wish you nothing but the best Leo
Always interesting and entertaining! Looking great!
So happy to see my dyneema soft shackles I gifted you are hanging in the background (at 27:19 into the vid). Plse let me know if you need more and what sizes and  dimensions!
👍👍👍👍😀
Fantastic video as always. Since it seems like this channel and the project are providing a payed job to several people, it would be so nice if after the boat is finished the crew could continue working on other boat building projects in the future. I hope there will be some kind of continuation.
Bring on the ads. I'll watch as many ads as you need :)
13:30 I was honestly still under the assumption that everyone on the project was volunteering. It's great to hear that you're able to compensate them for the amazing work they do.
Not only great tradesmen but they have great personalities on camera. It is a very entertaining channel
I'm so happy you are paying these wonderful tradesmen. It is a great channel and now I'm so much happier
While I understand that the whole project is on a financial tightrope, maybe consider bringing onboard an administrative assistant who could manage the project paperwork. It does the project no good if Leo is increasingly frustrated to not have any time for working with his hands, that is fundamental therapy so a healthy balance should be found.
My absolute admiration!
Thank you again for sharing your adventure building the Tally
Brilliant job all around!  As a woodworker, I especially enjoy the high standard of customized wood craft!  Patiences and skill are blended in the minds and hands of your very talented crew for some extremely well crafted parts and pieces.  Brilliant, simply brilliant!
definately not a boring episode . I started watching this project from the beginning and have followed ever since . Never sailed a day in my life but still love this
That was so funny, especially the weekly meeting ! Amazing project, so impressive.
It's been so awesome watching this boat go from a sad rotting thing into this beautiful thing you've remade by hand, please let us know if your doing a launch ceremony  at the end so I can come!!! I live super close!!! :D
Definitely one my favorite channels ---- thanks mate  Peace ~~ stay safe                     RAIDERNATION4LIFE
I‘m normally a quiet viewer - but these ads are just comedy gold and I want more. And if the deal is that you are getting good money for this amazing project I‘d say that’s a perfect deal. Love from germany!
Leo, I noticed that your “f%€@ing GORGEOUS” companionway steps are beautifully and perfectly finished, in a nice gloss Schellack. Emphasis on “glossy”, as I also noticed the seemingly notable LACK  of any tread, grooving, or checkering to create a suitable non slip surface.  Are you going to apply nonskid strips, or rely on the catlike reflexes and gecko grip of the crew?
I love watching this project I've been following it from the start. it's got me interested in boat building . So thanks 👍
Keep up the great work ❤
Love it
A very interesting group of  tradesmen. ⛵️🪚  great day in the life…
It’s clear you all work hard and are creating a thing of beauty and Leo, you certainly have a lot of plates to keep spinning. But what comes across above all, no matter the demands and stress of the project - you are having fun too.😀👍⛵️
🍻🇨🇦👨‍🏭
Never boring even though I have no boat experience, which makes it interesting, what is a bit strange is watching the crew out of character getting into character to earn sponsorship money to progress the build and pay their own wages.
Congratulations on full paired crew , good work makers viewers ,owner,
Hi there. Fantastic video. From South Africa and cant wait for your next one. This was a very    insignificant video. This is the best ever seen boat build. Lekker dag
Did you ever think, when you were all on your own pulling rotten planks off a $1 boat, that you'd end up with a paid team this large? Would you have taken on the job if you'd considered doing this enormous list on your own?
It just goes to show just how complex this project has become and its testiment to Leo's management skills. The forced move to Port Townsend has proved to be a blessing when you look at all the different people and skills involved now. All you need now is a full time video person, I think the whole video today was excellent.
Beautiful job on the ad! Keep on doing what you do! 😎
Great vid Leo :)
Never boring always fascinating
Thanks Leo and The Team for Yet Another Super Entertaining and Informative vidclip. I so look forward to your 'Fresh' Vidclips.... I am a retired 'Engineer' well on the wrong side of 70 and find All your vidclips Really well produced and with Wonderful content .... Well Done !!!!!..... Best wishes to You, The Team and ALL from Christchurch, New Zealand
If Frederick Douglas were advising Leo on shedding his workload, he might say: Delegate! Delegate! Delegate!
Leo, I know you focus on the work on the boat, but we really do appreciate all the work that you do to make it all happen. Looking back at ep1, I'll bet you didn't realise where it would get to.
Love these “behind the scenes” videos.   … and the bronze basin!
14:00 a lot of excuses why Leo did not play a camp hobbit this week
an excellent Video Leo..Thankyou for the journey mate
The most amazing work by all.
Absolutely fantastic video again Leo, the progress over the last 12 months is amazing, well done to all involved.
Such brilliant work Leo.
What an amazing team! Love how they think while in meetings too. 😂
LOVE the “Blue Nile” advertisement!  Wish I could afford to spend on that…
Love the head soundtracks at the meeting! 😀
Tally HO2 will be very special for all the shipwrights and trades people involved. A significant amount of very unique features, e.g. the source of the wood for the bow sprit. Some of the compromises, challenges or design mock up upgrades required e,g. the galley layout or functional master head sink size.
Great video you’ve a great bunch of people working for you 👍
I cannot believe the man hours that go into just editing these videos let alone the rest of the work! I had no idea, mind blowing!
Rabbits??? At 11.06 minutes to my surprise they talk about rabbits again. But I simply could never and still can't see them. I saw chickens, dogs and even a parrot on this channel but never a rabbit. ;-)
I loved the video. Loved the insight of what happens on a daily basis. My favourite bit was the the LOR based commercial. I laughed my ass off. Just brilliant.
Gotta admit, the way you guys do ads are are pretty, ummm, interesting, sort of. At least ya get a good laugh out of it. Love the humor🥰
Thanks again love your work
Morning just driving to work with a coffee in one hand and a camera in the other 😂
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
An amazing video Leo! Really clever idea to show a day in the life of Talley ho project. You answered a nagging query that has been uppermost in my mind recently and that is your revelation that each of the workers are now being paid.  The staff briefing was sooo funny especially each of the  vingnettes of each workers view of the value of such meetings Patrick is just an absolute card! I’ve followed this project for the start and would really appreciate an update regarding Pete and where he’s now at.
I'm full of admiration for the way you have managed and presented this wonderful project. Many and various skills  are required as well as an amazing ability to keep the team on track in a fun and engaging atmosphere, vey well done! i wish you all the best in the future.
Best advert yet. So funny
i have been following you the last 2 or 3 years, and i saw how was the work , very good job done but ...just finish the boat, you are doing too much dummies things, we enjoy seeing how to build a boat, no offense but you are not a comedian, and your workers as well, so show where they are skilled, finish the boat, sail it and start another project, maybe the same boat but with new technologies and ways to do it from the new technologies,  make a couples of trips with the people that help you to build the boat, make 4 or 5 travels , you can also do a lottery to the followers to get one of these trips , and in the middle time ask the audience what they want you to build from zero, an updated new sampson boat with all the expensive staff, and another one in the way most cheap posible/and safety, we would like to see how to sail this boat probably is not easy and is interesting
I hate ads. But yours including the whole crew are so hilarious I am looking forward to the next episode.
Just Awesome Leo and gang!
I have been an avid viewer since the start of your project Leo, and you always make sure to end your videos by saying how incredibly grateful you are to the viewer community. Although the end of your project is a way off still, you will all too soon be at the start of your journey. I have to say that even though its been a tortuous journey and the pressures have frequently been evident, you and your build crew have done nothing but enhance pleasure to the viewer.  I am retired and I so wish I could do more to financially support the project. The guilt I feel by not bring able to do so is constantly salved by some of the best supporting advertising and equally compliant advertisers.  I have mentioned previously that nice people attract other nice people and it is especially evident on these round-up occasions when it becomes easier to understand how valuable just being a nice person is.  I’m so looking forward to seeing you in the UK with Tally Ho at some time in the future. So, as this critical stage of the project approaches, I would like to say how incredibly grateful those of us in a similar position to myself are, to you, your crew and your substantive supporters, for the sheer privilege and pleasure of watching you work so hard every week.
Dude you must sleep only a couple hours a night. After you go do your thing sailing around the world, you look a good fit for CEO of a yacht building company.
That modem sound haha!
I almost always fast forward adds in videos but you are nailing these
lotr skit made me laugh a lot :D
Hey Leo, my great grandfather worked as a shipwright in Shoreham Sussex at about the time Tally Ho was built. I think he had a hand in it. See if I can find any old photos or tools passed down.
Really great work Leo.  Shame you can't get a skilled project manager and video editor, allowing you to do more of the wood work.  I've chucked some more into the pot, appreciate it is a drop in the ocean, but if most can manage to do the same you can get this undertaking completed to the standard and timescale it deserves.  Hope the outstanding funding comes good in the end; bad times for many people.
Totally love this story! What an amazing team. Stunning craftsmanship and well done to all involved. Keeping the skills and knowledge alive!
Excellent update!
Brilliant as usual, laughed out loud at the ‘what they’re thinking’ in the team meeting! 😄 Can’t wait to see a Rigging episode.
There is so much admin and stuff behind the scenes. I'd have thought a really valuable member of the team might be bought in to handle the bulk of the admin side. Might help Leo get on the tools a bit more. I'm sure Leo has considered that though, as he's very good at considering everything! 👏
"The wheels on the bus go round and round" I spat my coffee out and laughed for 5min😂
Leo you need to go sailing lol
thanks for another great video. AND for me this weeks Highlight was the Advertisement 😆
Best stuff om YouTube leo
Very nice video. Lots of variety. Kudos!
What a great crew. masters in their crafts and such a joy to watch.
Some people has a vision and some has a mission. The rest of the people follow on youtube! Always interesting your adventure! Keep filming!
I laughed way to hard at "The weels of the bus go round and round " 😂
Man, that's a nice teak gutter.
God this video was just so great
You accidentally built a boatyard!😅 I'd suggest your next hire should be an admin/project manager. And a video producer.
very interesting and insightful, great video.
Definitely interesting. You guys are cooking along.  Great to see!!
Lovely video mate. YouTube is a funny old animal and people I am sure are speculating on this and that and probably getting it wrong. We appreciate your transparency and honesty especially when it comes down to ✍🏽💷. The biggest payback for those guys is having people see their awesome work and knowing theyve contributed to something beautiful. A little monetary reward helps along the way though 😜. Great show and we are all learning a lot. Looking forward to more vids and ultimately to seeing her touch the ocean for the first time. Top dog. Greetings from Essex UK 🧐🤙🏽
What comes over in this video is what a great team of perfectionist that Leo has amassed, and what a great sense of humour the whole team has and that it would be a really great working environment to learn a craft that is truly awesome to watch. Tally Ho just gets more and more beautiful with each passing video.
hillarious 😁
Good job on the sponcer. Funny😅
120per cent good luck
It's a strange thing but of all the traditional crafts I have been a part of, boat builders are the oddest. It seems to be the town at the end of the railway line. The basement pool bar. The place where misfits, never quite made it anywhere else dude's end up.  Divorced is a common theme along with drug and alcohol abuse. Or unconventional sexual preferences. It's the kind of place where you meet guy's who would otherwise be boring the bartender with their sob stories or need a lift to the whorehouse on pay day. I guess that's why I never stayed around boat shops very long. Learned a lot of useful skills but I didn't want my self esteem to end up on the barbecue.
Hey Leo, great video as always. Is there no way for you to hire an assistant / accountant to do all the "boring" work for you? They might not only be a little more efficient than you are but also like the job :D. The editing I get that you "need" to to that. But you pay people to do jobs you want to do and don't get help with that!? Gosh that sounded harsh, I love you man and all the crew as well. Just thought you could make your life a little easier. <3
Nick really suits Frodo's look
An hour per minute sounds insane
I actually went back to watch Patrick and the wheels on the bus song😂
Great work 👏👏👏👏
This particular insight is just Wow! (meaning, a total delight to get both the ‘backstage’ vibe and the sweet and goofy infomercial.) There’s lots of talent yet untapped here. Keep It Up!
Great to see ‘A Day in the Life’ of Tally Ho and her builders!
Forget the boat, go full time theatre!
Excellent video.
Well done guys, this is the only youtube channel that i DO NOT skip the sponsor segment, well made and hilarius😂😂😂. Great content, best wishes from Toulouse
What a shame would it be to break up a extremely dedicated,talented,well honed team of professional shipwrights like this… so I’m hoping and praying somehow they will find a way to become a company of their own in someway.  They are amazing people, love these guys and girls !
Been following since the start - love this project
Hey Leo!  Like the meeting😂👍🏻. But we already have a DM “?” Done having enough of that act!
Brilliant brilliant brilliant video this week
👍👍👍
the best boat builders and the best advertisers on the web
You all are doing a great job! Amazing!
I don't know why, but clicking the "Like" button doesn't seem to register. Not the first time I've encountered this, either.
G-day Leo thank you to you and Crew for the video mate your all doing a tradesman like job .Heres a bit of trevia for you I served my apprentisship as plasterer forth generation in Belfast the real one where Titanic was built mind you the last ship I worked on as a tradesman and insadently the last big ship ever to be built there in was for Arostathol Onassis for lease to Shell oil its name was ESSO Ulidia (not Greek) Gealic its displacement dead weight tonnage was 230,000 thousand tons the first super tanker ever built to run Ahbadan in the Persian Gulf to Vera Cruse because the Sues Cannale was blocked The Egypians Sank every british ship ithey could fined in the middel of it. The Ulidia only lasted 12 years and was   beached in Goa India for scrap sorry for the history lesson but I find when people do not explain very well, thats how details get lost  The question what was a plasterer doing on an Iron ship ? Hot and Cold insulation miles of it there was roughly 8 miles of pipes tanks and boilers finished by hand now days the insulation is covered  by metal in most cases. It use to be on a lot of passinger ships not all but most the fancey work as it used be called and which most think is woodwork is Plasterwork run in situe and no I did not work on the Titanic the last ship my father worked on was the  Canberra which the brirish used as troop ship in the Falkans in the early eighties. All this has no realivence what so ever to what you doing on Talley-ho except to you know when I used the term tradesman like I understand what that means and can aprecate the task you have all under taken and good trades people never get rich we tend to give it back as we work the job comes first life is incidental to it. I’m off my soapbox. My joy was to raise a family and better off than my wife ever were and we have been married fifty three years so be happy at your and it not has a task but a vocation. I apolgise for the rammble but I know a good job well done.cheers from Australia. 🫶🦘✌️👍❤️
The Blue Nile Jewellery ad is priceless. Whose warped mind thinks up these gems … oh wait, I forgot about Patrick and Nick 😂
Very interesting video!  Who knew building a boat would turn into running a company and employing people, being the Purchasing dept., HR dept., shipping and receiving, etc… let’s not forget film maker. I have to say the work you do appears to be outstanding and inspiring.  Thank You!
The ONLY YouTube channel that I actually watch the adverts, very funny 😎 Amazing stuff from Leo and crew.
Great Video
Leo, the day in life is a pretty cool way to tell your story. As the project has developed, so has the complexity. It's fascinating to watch. Thank you and your team for sharing.
Very informative mate.👍
The wheels on the bus go round and round, is the single best sound track to Patty's life.
Hi team. Each episode is unique, talking about a unique project. So, you people are Unique!!  A very nice theme that you focused again, all these professional people on a boat yard. About your extra publicity job, keep going😂!!! Thank you for everything!!!
500k coming up FAST LEO!!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️  Add Super Thanks so we can send you some $$$$
Leo, Do you still wince when they say rabbit instead of rebate?
Fantastic video, love the behind the scenes.
Merch Leo, surley some Sampons Boat Co merch would sell very well.
I can't wait to see her completed. The level of craftsmanship throughout this build has been amazing.
Leo - Your ability to juggle all the aspects of a complexe project makes me think you'd make a good Const Supt . I spent years scheduling large projects using Critical path charts they can't be beat . But remember to keep a log and update the schedule regularly . The boats really looking fine ..great crew!
This episode of Tally Ho was awesome.  What a team meeting - reminds me of the one that I have with mine once a week.  Pat & Clifton - OMG such an amazing craftsmen - those hatches are an incredible work of art. LMAO that add for Blue Nile was so funny.  Thanks for sharing the list of projects each of the team members was working.  Such a great team you have working on Tally Ho.  I totally get the stress as a team lead to manage the build and not get to participate as much as you want in the actual "grunt work"  the good news is a great crew makes a team lead's job much easier than .... well - it appears you don't have to worry about that crap.  Such a great episode.  Keep up the good work Leo!  It is such a blessing to have such a good team backing you up on the Tally Ho Project.  Such an enjoyable video. Thanks for sharing.
Very interesting video seeing what goes on daily. I still cannot get over the incredible precision of the woodworking; I didn't know it was possible to make things so perfectly out of wood. I imagined that a wooden boat would be fine with rough but good enough finishing, and not bespoke furniture quality.
Great work keep it up!! Love all the detail work on the hatches.
Hmm, now I will go see how the Front DOOR installation went......(Tee Hee)
How much does YouTube and sponsorships actually bring? Because based on what I can tell, it's only about $50k/yr give or take.
Love the change of pace and seeing what everyone is up to
I really liked this behind the scenes look at all the different work that goes on every day. As a former project manager I can say that the management aspect grows exponentially as more people get involved. Great job keeping it all organized Leo!
Really loved this style of video! I definitely prefer the usual format, but these sneak peaks are super important and give great context
Leo I love what you're all doing with Tally Ho and the videos are awesome! Your channel is amongst my top 2 subs of the week that I watch without fail every week. My five cents worth is, why don't you consider getting a camera guy/lady that is also a video editor.. They can just follow your current method and save you 40 hours or so in a week? From South Africa..
Crazy respect for the hard work and effort that goes into these videos for over 3 years.
Thanks Leo... Love your work
We all love and support you and your epic project... I've been watching you since the beginning. Just keep doing what you are doing.. Remember,  all you did before YT got you where you are now.
A crew full of talent, what’s not to like?
Hang in there Leo!
Love what you folks are doing; wish I had more money so I could be a more functional part of your pack.
Another great video from Leo and Co. every video is a drop everything and watch and always will be!
Nice job Leo. It has most definitely not been boring. I have enjoyed this video equally as well as all the other videos. Always enjoyable to catch up with the crew and what is going on. Thank you for the videos. They are helping me deal with down time while I am on the mend from surgery I had in January.
This was super insightful.
❤❤❤Loved it! Not boring at all.
You have more people on the job than many small boatyards I have worked in, congratulations on assembling a wonderful team of craftspeople and holding the whole job together. The adds are compulsory viewing, not something to skip and now we know the the "Duchess of Desire" gets her jewellery from the fabulous Blue Nile.
I love seeing the progress as well as the craftsmanship. However the special part of this build is the team that has been assembled. Not just in their skillsets but their interactions. Everyone appears to be genuinely happy to be there doing what they do with each other. Of course editing can make it look that way as well but I don't think that is the case. It seems very genuine so it is either true or Leo is a master at editing, possibly both are true.
Is it customary to maintain a maintenance schedule for polishing the brass? I would love to see all the brightwork at a high polish against the beautifully varnished wood. Obviously its a workspace at the moment...
Best ads on Youtube 😂😂
Still my number one channel❤
Always interesting Leo... never for a moment doubt that!
Thank you for sharing this wonderful project.
Great video!  Loved the added comments and sound effects, especially the modem!   Ahh, those were the good old days!
Exquisite
Really enjoyed the video - thanks Leo 👍
❤ really good video Leo sending much love from Australia xxx❤😊
The biggest problem I see is when this boat is finished  It’s going to be to nice to put in the water  Awesome job
You forgot Nic working on the front door 😆
❤
Fridge next to the Oven ?
Very interesting to see some behind the scenes footage. You have built an amazing crew.
you should be paid triple for your adds, the story telling is worth even more !
My dear friend Brion Toss and I just happened to catch Etienne (ATN) when the welded armature for his mast climbing rig broke and we caught him in a 10' freefall during one of our many US boat show tours.  We shared some water and then attended the Lats & Atts party that I threw...
Dear Leo, I love your project.  I love how detailed you are, I love how kind yo are, your the best of us of us.  I send you another $100 because I love watching what your doing.
Leo is the best boss
Happy you have a passionate crew, that is they key to success!!!!
I can't believe this channel has somehow gotten BETTER with the addition of sponsorships - these skits are hilarious and really show off the friendship and goofy side of the team
Very interesting - to see a snapshot of what everyone is working on!
Beautiful woodwork!!!
Another great video!  The amount and level of craftsmanship that is going into this project is beyond belief.
The boat is ok but the dog is the best!  Much more valuable when it comes down to it.
Very interesting video
I've been following your project from the beginning and supporting when I can and attended the Open House. This is one of the best videos you've ever made.
Thank you for the overview, this is such an amazing project with trades and skills you just to see everyday. Thank you!
The depth of the: interpersonal, technical, maritime and ‘general’ engineering skills; just blows my mind. I came across this channel a few years ago whilst looking for something to take my mind off my own life and challenges and this content just keeps getting better and better.  This boat is a vehicle for growth, memories, learning and dreams.  As much as I can’t wait to see this vessel splash I kind of never want the channel to conclude. Thank you for sharing this journey it’s made a material difference to my life. Stay happy and healthy one and all.
WATCH LIKE SUBSCRIBE TO RAT RODS FOR AFRICA !
Aah... Commercials, perfect.
As always great stuff Leo,  it must be frustrating being locked away in an office all the time with so much great work going on around you - luckily the ppl you work with are awesome!  This will prob get lost in the 1000 odd comments but it would be great if you could do a video dedicated to a shop tour, where certain stations/tools are and what gets build at them which of the crew spends most of their time where etc...Woodworkers love to see how others setup their shops.  Lastly, to the TallyHo community reading this, if you're thinking of giving Leo some significant $$ (e.g. pay for the spars) put your money where your mouth is first!
I’m pretty sure we would watch you do paperwork leo
Ahahahahah!
Fantastic work Leo, I am so happy for you.
Fascinating video, Leo, thanks for that. I am gobsmacked by the size and complexity of the whole project, as well as the enormously skilful work put in by every member of the crew. And thank you for making your ad slots hilarious, that is something others can learn from you. Good luck with the work ahead, and Godspeed, all.
Love you guys
I love it
Thank you for doing what you are doing from a grateful audience. Everything you have done over these many years has inspired myself and many to finish or start projects that have been in the recesses for years. The people, personalities and craftsmanship we have been introduced to is just extraordinary and we are lucky to know the many who have devoted their lives to the craft in which they excel. The quality of your videos continues to improve with each and every one and I look forward to the next.  I'm trying to increase my support and would encourage all your supporters to do the same. I'm not rich but when I can give an extra $100 or so I will. I want to see this project over the finish line.
It was interesting
All great content.  I'm sure you would rather be working on the boat,  but we appreciate your hours of editing work to share with us.
Fascinating video, love you guys & your work
Hello Leo from the Wirral England , the days are getting longer here and warmer here , blue sunny skies all day today. I cannot wait to Tally Ho finished once and for all, I have a 2016 Beneteau 48 so maybe just maybe I'll see you in the Atlantic maybe as I'm on my way to Bermuda I start off  there late spring / early summer each year after University has broken up ( I'm a Professor of Economics and Business ) Anyway love you're Youtube video's . Keep safe Hi to the Team My Friend. Professor Mark Woods
Such an incredible project, journey really. Happy to have been able to follow along since the very beginning, and thankful to have been able to contribute in some small ways. The comment about video editing taking roughly one hour per finished minute was eye opening. It's always been apparent that it's a lot of work, but I don't know that it's ever been quantified in such a way.
Haha that's f'in awesome!!!
Thanks for sharing your adventure with us.
Just remember to throw in the towel at the 11th hour like Wintergarten.
High from Australia,  keep up the good work
Ah Leo, nothing about this project is boring nor could it ever be boring.  Sorry to hear that it appears that someone offered to fund the spar project and has maybe reneged on it.
Beautiful! Like the format change, the foogin ad was priceless, great video.
Is that the same Brion Toss who wrote _The Rigger's Apprentice?_ Good book!
Well, that's twice with the promise for the spars not happening, first was the dinghy auction PITA. Keep going Leo, things WILL work out!
Good job crew!
Exemplary project management!
Your avertising team keeps getting better and better. Special props to Gollum and his team.
Just to add a little kick to the sponsorship for Leo's sake, my wife's engagement ring was from Blue Nile and I have a necklace from them. Both were bought a while ago, but we were quite happy with them.
Great episode! I've seen them all, this one was unique. Leo, you've a great mind for creativity. You're hands down my favorite channel!
That was an amazing video. You got to show kids what everybody’s doing and now I get a deeper understanding of your daily duties and how are you keep this fine-tune machine running and I’m glad that your crew is getting paid now and they’re not just volunteers. that means that you’re running in the black hopefully and I don’t know maybe I’ll send you a few bucks one time down the road but can’t wait till that ship is done. I followed you from the beginning, but not consistently you’re an awesome man Leo.
Great episode!
Love this update. Have been following the project from the beginning. Love every episode.
It’s great that you’re committed to growing the wooden boat building community. Could you give us an idea of your monthly payroll (I understand this may be a sensitive issue)?
These alternate type videos have always been appreciated. Truly is awe inspiring how much of a community is cheering on Tally Ho.
Kind of disappointed we havent seen more about the front door. Was looking very promising.
I am just blown away that you are doing all this and inviting us in. I cant give feedback about what I like or not as it is all great!
Probably too late, but what about a porcelain folding vintage sink, common on old trains and boats? They fold out of the way and dump into a porcelain receptacle.
Loved the look behind the scenes!
I had no idea how much work went into this project - or how many people worked on it.  And certainly didn't realise that everyone was paid!  Things have changed so much since the early days, it's almost a different project.  I am both overwhelmed by the amount of planning and organisation (and admin!) that goes into this (I've done some project management in my time - although nothing on this scale or duration - so I have some idea of the time and effort - and stress - involved) and humbled by the thought that my few pounds a month helps all this happen.  Mine is a minor part in all this, but it's still a wonderful thing to know that I've helped in the rebuilding of this beautiful boat.    What are all of us going to do (and feel) when it's all over?  It's become such a big part of my life that I can't really imagine it coming to and end.  But for Leo this must be both a fantastic thing to have done and organised, and, to some extent, also an albatross around his neck - his 'normal' life has had to be put on hold for so many years.  What's he going to do when it's all over?  Sail - a lot - I imagine!  Personally, as someone who is 70 this year, my perspective is narrowing down to hoping I get to see, not only the end of this project, but also Tally Ho returning home and sailing into an English port.  I want, not only to see this happen, but to board Tally Ho and to shake Leo's hand and thank him for everything he's done.  I should warn him, though, there may be tears!
Great video well done 😊
Leo, love the look behind the scenes of your project management and all your team. It makes me reflect back to when it was just mostly you and you said it would be 2 years until you were in the water.  Ironically, I think if you had to do all the work by yourself this project would have taken 20 years!  Your skills and leadership draws people and viewers to Tally Ho. Old man Strange is looking on from heaven saying, "good job, and see you in the water in two years!"
i love the add
The Usual Stuff.... AWESOME!!! Thank You!!!!
Mrs Richards: "I paid for a room with a view !"   Basil: (pointing to the lovely view) "That is Torquay, Madam."   Mrs Richards: "It's not good enough!"   Basil: "May I ask what you were expecting to see out of a Torquay hotel bedroom window? Sydney Opera House, perhaps? the Hanging Gardens of Babylon? Herds of wildebeest sweeping majestically past?..."   Mrs Richards: "Don't be silly! I expect to be able to see the sea!"  Basil: "You can see the sea, it's over there between the land and the sky."   Mrs Richards: "I'm not satisfied. But I shall stay. But I expect a reduction."   Basil: "Why?! Because Krakatoa's not erupting at the moment ?
Nice job on the video, very interesting
Holly fuck, I just misread the title of the video instead of RUNNING I read RUINING
Awesome job.  Keep up the great work!!!  Love the videos.
Thanks. Great video.
Usually I will FF the commercials, but your are to funny.  I look forward to them :)
Leo, Your videos never disappoint. I assumed there was a ton of behind the scenes work happening but this episode was still eye opening. Also, the woodworking  and joinery is being done with such attention to detail and such amazing craftsmanship it is awe inspiring and very motivational. You have a great team of artisans and it is particularly enjoyable to watch people who are so talented at what they do to flip an internal switch and become some of the most entertaining dorks one could hope to behold. It’s adds a unique and comedic aspect to your already well rounded posts. Deep respect for you and your team. Tally Ho is nothing less than a work of art that anyone would be proud to add their fingerprint to. Keep on keeping on Sir.
Went to the page in the ad and its timed out. I guess they didnt anticipate the traffic. Poor use of money
This is the only channel I don't mind having sponsorship sections because of how much fun you guys have with it and how funny they are. Honestly the best channel in YT I think.
Hey, Leo and crew! In June I'll be sailing a Nicholson 38' from Hawaii to ... here! Our intended landfall is Port Townsend. Hope to catch a glimpse of Tally Ho from a distance, without disturbing/interrupting! 😀
This is my first comment; but I've been a loyal follower since the original purchase and those agonizing days of the keel and frames.  I guess I have to come out of the woodwork now, as I think most of your followers feel the same, but I feel now is the time to say how much I admire you, Leo and your team as so fixed on a goal and doing EVERTHING to achieve it.  Please accept my eternal gratitude for your example to all of us mudding in life.   Cheers!
Crazy how I’ve basically been to the shop, at least the yard. I went to college at UW and discovered how cool Port Townsend is.
Happy to hear you listening to KEXP!
A longer video than usual but never boring. Looking forward to the upcoming videos on the spars and rudder work. Cheers.
It IS a really nice gutter .... and IT'S teak.  🙂
Great update. Thanks to all.
Amazing work as always!
Question : Are you going to be able to sail Tally Ho By yourself ? If not, what's the normal crew size ?
Amazing stuff bud!
That's the most wonderful custom hand made Teak gutter I've ever seen 😍
I think the line galley thing can be solved with some kind of sump pumps and so-on. Hooks for a strap to support the chef. In the grand scheme of things it is not that big of a deal.
17 minutes 28 seconds the diction is Nick & I not Nick & me.
Leo this is your best video yet !!!   It absolutely amazes me what you have accomplished… keep up the awesome work …
I cracked up during that bit where you had your meeting :) Thanks for sharing.
Leo it would be awesome to hear you talk about the current reality of this build compared to your expectations when you started.  I'm guessing that it's turned into something that exceeds your wildest dreams in one sense, although you'd obviously rather be woodworking than doing management and office work.  I guess my question is, is there any way that you would have taken it on if you'd had the list of current ongoing activities in front of you the minute before you bought it?  It's frankly a bit overwhelming even from here!  Keep up the great work.  Incredible boat you're all building.
Amazing video as always Leo. Thank you for sharing your journey with us. Nice one!
Kudos to the craftspeople who have worked on this boat from the beginning.
I gotta say leo, your quality over the last 3 years of viewing has just gotten better and better, always look forward to when a video is uploaded, if i wasnt a poor uni student id definitely donate to your awesome project! maybe one day if the boats over in NZ i can have a look at it (yeah right) haha
Yes, Leo, this video was most pleasing to watch. It gave a real sense of the scope of the project and a sort of sign post to all the directions to look forward to. 10/10.
Are you insulating the hull at all? If so are you using spray foam? The boat looks fantastic, worked building boats for16 yrs. ,your;re almost done.  Good luck
I can see it now- Sampson Advertising
So much more intergret  then a ROLEX  watch and mere interesting  to watch.
man, 😂 this ads are almost outshining the main content!
5:20 - fun fact : 80 inches is also the wingspan of a golden eagle
At least your having fun,,!
Comments for the algorythm
Rebuilding a boat myself while working full time, and was feeling sorry for myself until I watched this video. I have no timetable and no video to edit. Surgeon by training, shipwright by avocation. Your project and the documentation of it is marvelous. The endeavor constitutes a course in boat building.
GREAT VIDEO!!  Petect timing. I was getting so confused. Now I know what everyone is doing and I feel like part of the team again.
This was a VERY interesting video.  Very few viewers really understand what it takes to make a YouTube video and the final information you shared about the timing “1 minute of video takes an hour of editing to make” says it all.  It still amazes me to watch so many talented craftsman you have working on Tally Ho and, in my opinion, this boat has some of the best woodworking craftsman currently working on any similar style of boat project.  The joinery, including the integrated water trough, are simply the best-of-the-best and it’s clear that your very pleased with the outcome.
Afar blue hole - alas strewn purple haze and a stout craft of Mr Strange now with Mr Goold. Tally-Ho!  "Tally - Ho", I say! Then drive for Dungeness and another Stout Craft - Me say
Fantastically Interesting! Thanks!
Thank you for all the videos and entertainment that you and the other fine craftspeople have provided. It truly has been top notch and I think the BBC would be proud.
Very informative and entertaining. Thankyou
Round and round…. 😂❤ the ads crack me up too. ❤😂
Great video and amazing work! Keep it up I look forward to each video.
Very interesting video .. thanks for showing all the back end stuff .. really talented people you work with!
I thoroughly enjoyed this video THANKS
Great work mate 👍  Regards
Leo I've been watching your vids since the start. The art of project management flow and team morale. You have this in abundance. Time to get PA to pay bills and ordering, and an editor to free up your time. Great work to everyone.
8am ???? So... what bank do these people work at when not working on Tally Ho ?
Great work, what a team and team leader!
Just upped my Patreon membership. I know money can be stressful and I'll toss in what I can to help out. I've received countless hours of enjoyment from your videos. Keep up the great work.
If you can buy insurance on the boat at this point don't forget!!
Great video!
Are you guys member of SAG Union?    I think you should keep an eye out for SAG Attorney.
At 11:19 you show a gutter to catch any water that drips past the hatch, I saw one of these on a boat last year and they purposely angled all of the gutters so that the middle of the gutter was raised and the sides were lowered to make water run out of the gutter rather than just sit in the gutter on the wood.
I can’t imagine the stress that must come from the logistics and planning, but primarily from the financial tightrope you have to walk to keep the project alive.  To be able to continue being a wry, gregarious personality through all that stress might be one of your most admirable feats yet!
Huge amount of work goes into these videos!  Fav channel!
Did you save anything from the original boat?
My slight, unworthy suggestion my Friend, hire a cameraman and editor. I watch o many other channels and they did just that. It`s going to bite into your loot but it`s going to allow you to increase you content and give you more views. Money to create and build. You already know, you have to spit it out to get it back X 2
GREAT , Very Interesting   !
I’ve recently acquired several caulking tools (mallet, reefing hooks, over a dozen irons, etc.).  Do you have a need for such tools?
Indeed a better video. make sure you thank the United States of America and the great state of Washington for giving you the privilege of building a boat that will not fly the stars and stripes. Thank you for employing past volunteers who are now becoming full fledged shipwrights.
Your ads are the best. I think they're the only ones I've ever made it a point to rewatch them.😂
"Something-something... female Dwarf rumours confirmed, something something..." lol
Blue Nile ad was awesome, tell  Smeagol he is pretty.
This is one of the best videos you have produced.  Thanks for all you do for us.
I cannot recall having watched a Tally Ho vid that I didn't like.  This one is no exception.  Thanks for another fine one and I eagerly await the next.  P.S. Madison Ave. had better watch out for your crew.
I love when you post. But in have to say. As an observation, since moving sites your progress has slowed greatly. You are no longer under any urgency other then financial. You don’t have weather or neighbors or volunteers deciding your progress. Now you have cushy heated weather protected work shops. Lol but it’s all good. The longer it takes you to build the longer I’ll be a subscriber.
More like BS. Ha ha you go you guys
I love it ! you guys are living the dream. thanks for sharing,
This week’s episode truly helped me to get  a better perspective on the scope of the project.  Thanks!
Strangely, I'm unable to like this video; but rest assured, I LIKE this video. 👍
I just watch for the ad!
Always interesting content. Amazing craftsmanship.
Great video as always. Love seeing the progress.
Hey Leo, all your hard work is so much appreciated by all your viewers and it is just such a wonderful project! I think it is also really great that you pay everyone working on tally ho, i mean they have to live from something too. So today i finally decided to also become a patron and even though its not much it may help a little bit. Thank you!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Leo's become an outstanding project manager. Any shipyard or boatwork would be lucky to have him.
I’ve gotta say that cup of tea at the start looked questionable
I am a hobby woodworker and am just amazed at the craftsmanship and quality of work!
Beautiful joinery work! Everything starting to really come together! 👍👍🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🤘🏻🤘🏻
I’m not a woodworker of any sort. What I enjoy most is the ability the people on this project have. Even the younger crew members have skills that I think go beyond their years. Gorgeous.
Congratulations to the crew for the humour of the Blue Nile promotion.
Totally awesome and what i wanted to know re your vids.
Loved the video today, Leo. Great job to you and the rest of the team! Really enjoyed the different perspectives this video provided
I am watching Lord of the Rings because Paramount is running them in order this weekend. LOL Funny.
I'm proud to be a contributor. I should probably step up and become a patreon. Y
Hi Mr. Mahon
Interesting.  I am going to think 'round and round' when ever I see a certain person :-)
Oh f***…. These adverts are so good!
Yours are the only in-video promos that I watch all the way through and actually enjoy. You have done what no other YouTuber in my regular viewing has managed to! Artists every one of you!
Thank you, I like the longer videos 👍
It was wondrously interesting Leo!
This is so pefect.  I'm getting married to a 600 year old Hobbit in a few months and was struggling with the ring!
Thank you Leo.  For all you TUBE watchers... if you find yourself at the end of this video you should thumbs up and subscribe!
Different from normal, but still good.  You could do more like this.
600 year old hobbits! My word.
Great over view and thanks for putting in such effort each week on these videos
Whatever the sponsors are paying you, it’s not enough.😂😂
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!  Love you all of you guys.  You are all so funny and the absolute best craftsman I have ever seen.  Your work is impeccable.  This boat is going to be a legend when done.  A total work of art.  BEAUTIFUL.  Keep up the fantastic work Leo.  Just lovely.
Never boring Leo. I'm filled with admiration for how you guys all get along and the fun you have. I've worked on a big project with a lot of co-workers, the Duyfken 1606 replica build in Fremantle Western Australia, I know how important it is that people enjoy what they're doing and all rub along together. You guys are impressive in this regard. I'm envious I have to admit. Good on yez.
The meeting at the beginning 😂
Very interesting to see every days work! Thank you for great and fun videos! The quality of the finished woodwork is stunning and the guys working on it is interesting to view
Leo, no worries just keep doing what you and your crew do 👍
That ad was perfect.
No!No! Your video, s are brilliant! On your journey for the last five plus years disassembling, planning, building, planning, ordering, installing, sanding , cutting buying more parts, filming editing.....gosh it is truly mind blowing what you have accomplished in that time! My hat goes off to you, Leo! From living under a stair well in Bristol all the way to Port Townsend  👏! You have accomplished so much and took every one on a great and interesting journey! And a big thank you to the thousands of people who assisted in  the journey along the way! Thank you, Leo!!😀 Many freezing winters up in the mtns,. 100 miles east of you, you brought myself and others , many hours of enjoyment !👌
I basically skipped design work in my field, which sucks, because thats where the most fun is. I went straight to project management, which kinda sucks. I know them feels about wanting to get back into it with wood working. Being in charge of the whole thing is super important, and it helps being the one guy you answer too. But damn I miss just being able to do things...
One might think that it would be old hat by now, but every single week I am amazed at the level of joinery on this project (e.g. 3:58). The craftsmanship demonstrated throughout the Tally Ho restoration is a thing of beauty.
Why am I not at all surprised that Leo works 125% a day? How does the man have time to sleep?
Wish I wasn't so poor, but I have been watching since she was towed to the original property!
Greatings and big respect from Germany 🤘🏽❤️
Leo, I get your angst with spar funding and it's like all throughout your amazing odyssey of re re creation. I hope to complete an odyssey of my own later this year when I hope to be able to support your project in the style your dream and effort deserve. In the mean time I suggest you lift your eyes to the horizon of your dream and share, for instance, the first voyage your dream of, desolation sound, around Kodiac Island. Foshing for a halibut off the inner passage greater than the one my father in law caught around 2001 which was exactly 200 lb. If you can find Anchorage I'd be glad to take you, the one day s year when you can land a King without tags out of Deep Creek. I'd hope to finance your first voyage, maybe the Nortern Passage back to Ehgland, well past the extent to which you might consider my joining the crew or passengers.  Show us the passage on a chart and when you hope to proceed! Cheers, R. Ernest Demaray Portola Valley, CA
I loved the "The office" style with which the video began
amazing crew and excellent videos. really wonderful!
It's always interesting. Thanks you
Like a work shop "Update" style, really  great content, dynamic. I said it before; improve content shot on hand helds (gimble or even image stabalised) goes very well in the overall mix.
Tally Ho is looking Awesome.
You no doubt realise you’ve “discovered “ the Sampson Film Production Co😃. The ads are getting better and better.
Great work
As usual, great story telling; feels like I'm actually a guest in the work shop. I learned about how much time goes into editing your videos and I sense you are a perfectionist, so you probably apply that to creating these videos as well. You built a great crew and you are a fine leader among them.
Amazing work Leo
Leo, For your fans, you haven't put out a boring video yet.  Keep it up.  Just the fact that you have to put a sign out every morning politely telling people to please stay out of the shop and let you and the team keep working implies that you have a wide and active fan base.  I do think that you would have an opportunity to raise additional funds through some sort sale of merchandise, or a contest to win something.     Keep thinking outside the box and doing this excellent work and Tally Ho will be floating before you know it!
Love the video's - thanks
seeing the crew is great, i enjoyed this update seeing the talented folks making her sail again
That teak gutter is beautiful ❤️.  Another amazing ad
As much as everybody is eagerly awaiting the completion of Tally Ho and seeing her in her element ,I for one( I'm not alone) will miss seeing the skills of Leo and his crew of artisans and craftsmen. Leo should be proud of their work and dedication. It has been pleasing to see how Leo and the older craftsmen have nurtured and developed the younger members of the crew, past and present. Bravo Leo Phil from OZ
It's sad someone whelched out of paying for the mast.
I've got to say, on all other Youtube Channels, I skip forward at the sponsor part of the video. Not here. I love watching them here. So creative.
REALLY REALLY GOOD EDIT.  AMAZING CRAFTSMANSHIP
the best video that shows the scope of this project; it really is quite phenomenal.
⛵⛵⛵⛵⛵
I've been watching this channel for years, it's become part of my weekend routine to get my "fix". Throughout that time I've always appreciated the character that comes through in the video's, even with the changes in the crew over the years its always looked to be a very fun project for those involved.  Should have done it long ago but you've got yourself another Patreon member to help with those spar costs!
Never boring Leo!  Incredible craftsmanship. Well done
I have lived and worked on sailing boats for 40 years. I've been following Leo from the beginning of tallyho project and originally thought that it was too ambitious and like many others I have seen would end as another broken dream. I'm so impressed with Leo's perseverance and the quality of the work.  Tallyho is going to be one of the best  and most beautiful timber boats ever constructed.  I hope it gets sailed a lot instead of being put in a museum where it belongs.
Telephone down load tones and “Teak Gutter”,  I love Boat Nerds, Thanks Leo for your introduction to the broader community and keeping us in touch with your amazing team of characters.
May I suggest putting up some live stream web cams in some of the workshop areas and moving them around the boat to where work is taking place.  People will watch hours of work being done.  That would give you a little boost to send the project home.  I would link it to a separate channel.
Not boring not to long we all understand we are getting a high quality show for the fraction of the money it usually costs keep it coming thanks from Ct USA
we need to make sure Leo has a damn good party at the completion of this project!
6:08: thx a really small fridge for such a big boat...surely you'll be putting a deep freeze somewhere as well?
I am very curious about financing.  Where does the money come from?  I subscribe to you, Duracell Project, Ran Sailing, and sailing Magic Carpet. All are amazing wonderful craftsman and women. There is never any mention of how in the heck anyone can afford to do this. We see all the magical times of creating the dream..... but where does the money come from.    Do you all work 40 hrs a week at a job..... are you all silver spoon babies...... receive massive donations....... how does it work?    I understand this is very private information, but for those of us who have the dream, but not the money, it would be a great vid to explain some of this stuff.
Fantastic job capturing the work and progress!  An excellent example of craftsmanship too!
Interesting.
Yeees
You and everyone is doing a fabulous job, we can’t even imagine how difficult it is to capture all the details, having said….your doing a fantastic job trying to convey everything, and lastly for the ads… very entertaining
Very interesting. Your comic ads are  the only one's I don't skip through too.
This project has turned into a master class of boat building, wood working, problem solving and project management.  I mean Leo is like our Elon Musk, he just gets it done, and in spectacular fashion nonetheless.  The crew he has assembled is simply amazing, and the craftsmanship we're treated to each and every week is incredible!
The ads are amazing! 🤣
Why does Nic have black fingernails?
Great video,  love to see the progress
This was a nice change up to see a day in the life. I’m still in awe of the way the wood joints come together in such perfection. Tell me this happens on the first go each time...
The meeting segment  was perfect...you should make it a short.
Amazing project !
The wheels on the bus go round and round had me rotflol
The Blue Nile ad was awesome! Sampson Boat Co ads are the only ones I don't skip!
The staff always have a fallback as actors. ;)
Well, Okay then. Wasn't expecting THAT. The Wheels on the bus bit.
Sounds like you need a videographer!
too bad you can't fold up the sink....flexible tubing, low profile faucet or faucet built into the sink.
You have some amazing woodworks working for you! You’re very lucky
You can actually work at 125%  If you typically work a 10 hour day and you work an extra 2.5 hours that's 25% more than average.  So you did 100 percent of the work and 25 percent more. It makes complete sense to me because I'm a plumber not a math magician.
Fantastic video Leo! This "behind the the scenes" was very interesting. Your skills have grown from shipwright to videograper and film editor, HR manager, project manager, and CFO. Quite the resume!
Leo, It is probably not your style but I believe you could sell your story to Netflix or similar for millions.  It would make a great documentary series.  Cheers.
I kept expecting one of these jokers to start talking about unobtainium! 😂😂😂
Let's tip a cup of kindness for the life of Brian Toss an'  auld ang sine.
Yep, really interesting video! It's good to have videos like this as well, some people like me feel like they have a clearer view of what's going on with some "simultaneous" snapshots. keep up the great work!
Leo at one point I thought you were outsourcing most of your video editing? Wonder why you wouldn’t look at continuing to do that so you can be a bit more hands-off?
This has been one of the most interesting videos you’ve produced. Thank you for your dedication and your team’s efforts. Past and present included! Awesome effort! Be encouraged as I have watched this series from the beginning.
@SampsonBoatCo thank you sir for your amazing videos! they are not only inspiring and convicting, they are emtional on a level that most cannot achieve, and you defininitely use it to make content that entertains AND HEALS!
Truly I don’t no anything about boating but my god truly I find my self comparing your channel and ancor just beautiful well done to all the team
awesome video
#deskmakover    for this amazing guy!
Not boring at all Leo! To the contrary, it was very interesting to see the 'controlled chaos,' involved in the project. Time for me to drop you guys another dime in payment for the pure entertainment! P.S. the Blue Nile Advert was worth the price of admission!
Glad to see everyone is able to have a good time, so wonderful to see how things are shaping up.  As someone who doesnt know much about boats I really appreciate the time you take to explain things.  Have a nice weekend.  Charles
This so so funny seeing the banter and Erica at the end is for funny… lol 😂
If, as Thomas Carlyle said, genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains, then Leo's workshop may be the densest concentration of genius on the planet.
This channel should have over 1mil subs
You forgot to mention in your activities writing directing and filming all those lovely commercials. They’re so intellectually stimulating and the fact that I said that with a straight face is totally shocking. OK I lost it. OK I’m trying to get it back now. Try not to laugh too loud. Not working still laughing. OK I think we got it. Where were we…….still chuckling. OK anyways writing those wonderful commercials. I’m gonna go laugh some more So, see you later
Good on you Leo 🙏
Thank you for a great video! Thoroughly enjoyed it!👍
Really enjoy the longer format videos.......keep em coming
I would say a normal Leo day was pretty much what I would have imagined based on the progress and multiple projects happening not only in the shop but other vendors.   I'm thankful that's this has continued with amazing success and that's all due to Leo and who he is as a person. That's the secret ingredient to the whole thing.
we love working with spruce :)
Great update Leo. I absolutely love your goofy commercials. Keep them comming!
I am not a nautical man but the skills and vision involved leaves in awe. My hat is off to you and the others. Congratulations.
Leo when the boat is finished, the commercials you guys do are hilarious and you should get a comedy routine together, you guys would definitely be a smash!!
Really great that you can pay your crew - too many of these projects rely on dedicated amateurs working for love.  But the whole thing has changed so much from One Man And His Boat.  Project managing, instead of being on the tools: it was bound to happen, once it got so big 😢    I am appalled, but sadly not surprised, about the person who promised to pay for the spars and then ratted.  There's no excuse: if his circumstances have changed then he needs to take out a loan or sell something so he will keep his word.  There are few things more despicable than breaking your promise.  I hope a few more people can increase their sub to help out: it must be such a worry.  The most impressive thing? You run such a happy crew.
They're down to eating quarter-donuts.  Will they live to see the launching?
Interesting, not boring! 😊
All about having fun by the looks of things!?
Great vid, Leo and crew, you all are doing great work, and we can see how BUSY you are !!!   along with all your crew !!!
When you first started this, were you planning on doing all the work yourself. Or, were you planning on hiring people to help like you've got now? Just curious
Kill it! Make it business only one that is the one only the benshw.
Abolish Tuesdays
I truly enjoy all the videos and appreciate what I now have learned, that much time must be dedicated to the produce them. Thank you and the entire production team working to complete this wonderful and beautiful sailing vessel, Tally Ho.
What a great video thanks. I really appreciate you and the rest of the crew.
Glad to contribute a few bucks to your interesting and amazing work. I hope more people pitch in to cover costs.
I never thought sponsorships could be so ... stimulating. (nod to Katherine Hepburn).
Very interesting, thanks!  J.R.
Leo, I wish I was able to support you more than by just watching. Todays video was fantastic great to see what it takes. Cheers. 👍🇦🇺👍
You are so close now!! But what happens then? Sorry dude fan Sweden 🇸🇪.
The Tally Ho is taking shape!!!  Great quality and attention to detail on every component of this magnificent ship.  Keep up the good work, attention to detail, and quality!!!  She will be soooooooooooo beautiful on the water!!!!
The ads!!! Love them!
Hahah the ads are brilliant
Big LOVE from a Sweden gye.
There is nothing wrong with your math, you just have 28 HOURS IN YOUR DAYS. Most people can not grasp the amount of behind the scene work there is in designing and building a small ship and am not refering to the very funny adds.   Keep at her
Great video giving us a taste of the complexity of this project.
Great video guys! I've been here since the beginning and will always be following along. Cheers
I really appreciate the ‘behind the scenes’ episode..
Do you guys ever squabble? hahaha
At least the adds are funny, really funny.  I giggle when I see your adds.
id like to work wity youy guys. Buy me a ticket and i come.
I’m an engineer and mathematician, and the percentages you noted are just fine if your basis is a 40 hour workweek. And we all can see your workweek is closer to 80-90 hours much of the time, which means you are often at 200% of a normal workweek. So no problem in your use of that >100% application Leo, and I’m sure all your viewers are okay with it. 😊
Of all the YouTubers I follow your promotional spots are the best. 😂
Awesome video!
Ha ha.  The wheels on the bus go round and round.  Perfect!
I see the Sampson Players have been at it again. Andy Serkis called, he wants his dignity back. LOL!!!
Never boring, I am always looking to get more of this project. Like to see what everyone is working on, I even like to see Leo putting in that extra 25 percent lol. What an awesome undertaking, great to be able to watch it and see all the people  that have a hand into it.
Interesting as always and I am grateful to be able to follow along in this epic project.  Thank you Leo and Crew.
If every ad was like that I'd watch them all on all my YouTube channels
Those spars will come in real handy when you need something to use your spar varnish on.
Good overview. Why are you doing filming at all at this point.  Seems like the easiest effort to delegate.
Wow coming together nicely!  lots of progress Tally Ho team!!  Great job all!  👍👍
Please some more commercials like the Blue Nile one😂
Leo, the biggest question in my mind is what are you going to do with all the tools and equipment that has grown into a small wooden ship making shop? l doubt if they can fit  into a container van when you start sailing Tally Ho?
I would love to help but being  from Ireland makes it useless and unfortunately I'm not able to send cash  but when you make it to an Irish shore I will help out any way i can
With so many woodworkers having worked on the boat, is there a difference in styles and skills that show up that could be a problem showing up in the future. I'm talking about the overall look here.  Great job to everyone, and I'm sure Leo, that you'd feel much better in the dust and making appropriate noises, rather than doing what your position has grown into now. Big kudos to you and many thanks!
Thanks for keeping us updated
So in the end who is going to be able to afford this boat ?
Thanks Leo, that was very interesting, and these integrated ads are a real hoot 🤣
This boat is hands down the best hand made craft in the world
I clicked Thumbs Up at the end of the Blue Nile ad.  Sod the boat, let's have more Tally Ho Players' Guild!  P.S. the gangway hatch is bee-yewtiful! Nice work Pat!
What an evolution. From a $1 boat dreamer to running a shipwright company. It’s been fun watching Leo’s progress as well as the boat’s progress these last few years.
Love the vids !!!
Love the high level of Project Management!  Amazing!
There must be about a zillion ads on YT. The few ones worth looking  at are mostly on this channel.
Smeagle, aka Gollum, was actually a man, but I’m sure a hobbit would like Blue Nile. 🙂  Oh, back in the 80s there was a blues/jazz band named the Blue Nile! I have the CD, and the music is quite good. Leo, I’m thinking they were an English band.
The Monty Python-esque ad inserts are becoming more interesting that the main video! These guys and girls crack me up :-)
A Masterpiece on every front by all who have contributed their skills. Joe
Now I understand why your wild hair grows the way it does. 😅😂
Your efforts and time spent were worth it.  Very entertaining and informative. Five Thumbs UP!
Love the Lord of the Rings reference.  Great job
I enjoyed this episode, maybe not as much as previous ones, but all the content on this channel is good quality and strikes a good balance between showcasing exceptional boat building craftsmanship, the human element of getting to know the team and their personalities but also understanding the progress of the project where all the pieces are coming together and leaving the viewer with the understanding that there’s about 2 years before the boat is ready to sail.
Love the format! Definitely my fav channel and genuinely get excited when I see a new vid released.
I can’t believe the amount of “behind the scenes “ work there is. Can’t wait till it’s finished. Leo, what editing program are you using?
A good laugh is a precious thing.
Who knew?……./Now I do. Thanks, Leo👍🏻
Incredible, thanks for sharing. I don't think viewers, myself included, understand the cost of a project like this. I look forward to seeing it afloat.  🤙
I just can't get enough of the superb craftsmanship all of you display. Best YT channel ever!!
I can't imagine how you would have been able to get to this point at the previous location.  Not with all the people now working on the project.  Jerk or no jerk you probably would have had to relocate by now.
Boring or interesting? mate it is definitely interesting.
Very interesting.  My favourite channel and project
Never boring, always interesting Leo
But still, what's Becka doing ....
Nice!
Super interesting video, even if it deviates from the norm. As a Patreon supporter, it makes me happy to know that some of that money is going to pay the incredible craftspeople who are working on the project.
to recap, 2:54 👍
Cool! Thanks for sharing!😊
Great work Leo and team 👍👍
The fit and finish is stunning from all the Tradesman and Trades Lady's. Really fun to watch. Thank you.
Hello Leo and Gang, very informative video and your Blue Nile Add was hilarious. Loved it . Cheers, Michael from Sunny Sandspit on Haida Gwaii.
Came for boat building, stayed for the ads!
It’s a great thing you’re doing Leo. So interesting even for me who is not a boaty. You have such a talented team around you to help achieve this amazing goal.  Can’t wait for next video👍
😃😃😃😃
I know you've always predicted this project will be finished two years ahead of schedule, so I won't ask how much time is left on the project.  But if you think of all the things that need(ed) to be done from woe to in the water can you give a percentage estimate of where you're at?  50%, 75%, hopefully way more than 25%?!  Tally Ho, you and the team are certainly showing how it should be done.
Been enjoying this project since the beginning, became a Patreon today!
Leo.. whatever you need to do.. do it.. we are here for it❤  Idea.. what about a kive camera on tik tok or something.. where you can move it from place to place.. ppl can send gifts and things.. make more money that way?🤔 Just a thought.. so proud just to be the tiniest part of this project even as just a watcher
Brilliant as always, crack on guys. Best channel by far on the tube!
Best channel  , I can't  get  enough  of your boat build. Just love the amazing  craftsmanship  of the beautiful  wood being  used  and the way you present  it is fantastic
Leo is a rock star.  His exceptional journey is a case study in passion and endurance.  I hope he keeps producing videos when Tally Ho is plying the seas.
Way to go Leo! Wonderful video as always! I know it may be frustrating not being as hands on with the work as you used to be, but managing the project is the most important job at this stage and it’s important that it doesn’t get away from you! Inspiring as always. I can wait to see her eventual launch!
This ship is a sculptural and designer work of art created by a group of unusually talented people,  with exceptional skills.
Your team fit, like the incredible joints they make. People like that don't grow on trees, you are blessed.
Dear Tally Ho team, especially Leo S. Goolden this time. 👍👌👏 You, Sir, are obviously a really gifted and great project manager! Adding this to your mighty long list of skills and talents makes me admire you even more (if even possible). Good heavens! Until now I didn't completely realise how big this project has become, how many people/great craftsmen are involved  and how much effort it takes to make these fantastic videos! By the way: I'm absolutely always blown away by the extraordinary high quality of the work that is put into this boat. Absolutely every detail is well planned, thought over painstakingly again and then finished to perfection. Congrats to all you extremely skilled craftsmen. Last but not least: The advertisement is hilariously funny again and as always. Again especially the bloopers about the ad exited me a lot. It's always great to see you all having a lot of fun respectively a good laugh. So: Thanks a lot for making teaching explaining recording editing uploading and sharing. Best regards, luck and health in particular. To all of you of course. Post Scriptum: At last we could hear where the bow door will be sitting for real.
I am always amazed by the craftsmanship of your crew. I've been around excellent carpenters but they don't hold a candle your shipwrights. Just blows my mind!
I sort of imagined you slept in a hammock on site!  Great video already. Even though I’m only a few mins in!
Always interesting Leo, thanks so much.
Not boring. Very interesting. Thanks for sharing
I am grateful that Leo found his way to Washington. This project helps to  keep the skills and tradition of our local wood boat building industry alive and healthy.
Beautiful, beautiful craftsmanship. So excited to see the process of Tally Ho! You guys are just amazing!! ❤
Alright Leo, take my money. Love you, the whole gang and the project itself!!
Nice light comedy here and there,👍🏼
A+ chuckles!😊
Brilliant report, What a clever hard worker team of tradespeople
Oh shit the wheels on bus… great just great perfect
Super interesting to get a glimpse of how your days are, how you work ✊
I agree, that basin looks weird. Reminds me on a baptismal font.
I am so grateful for everything you do. Thank, thank- THANK YOU for taking us on this journey! After tally ho is finished you should do smaller wood working projects and less paperwork! It is a necessary evil but i hope that you get to put more into your woodworking in the future.  we love you Leo!
Very professional outfit. Everything's done right and everything's done for a reason, not just for views and likes. The stated goal is the one that's driving the project, and everyone's nice and friendly. Plus, everyone being paid is nice too. Good work needs to be appreciated at all levels. Nice job everyone!
Anybody wanting to know the magic why we keeping watching? Re-watch EP1 to capture the character of what was to come. I still consider Leo as much a Videographer and Visionary as a Shipbuilder.
It’s never remotely boring Leo. You and your amazing team have come such a long way in creating this incredible boat.  Tally Ho may be your vision but equally it’s a shared vision of all who have been and are involved..The craftsmanship is second to none..She will truely be a floating piece of art once finished..
You certainly  have grown into a great job over time!
I love watching yall do quality workmanship  keep it up folks !
thank you for this insight of the reactor, quite vivid and lively...
I always skip in-video ads, but never yours. Looking forward to seeing the video covering Zeal's work on the rudder!
Jesus Leo; how can you say "work" with a straight face?  It's OK to hang onto the tail of the tiger as long as you and the tiger are in love!
Would hiring an accountant/financial coordinator make sense?   I really appreciate you Never going for hiring an editor. Like wow that’s a lot of work but every video is platinum
Thank you Leo for all you have done here. As a former P.T. resident, it's heart warming to see friends from my years there keeping on with their passion of boat building, see the town remaining fairly intact as I knew it, and the progress of your fantastic project. I follow your videos with great interest.
Don't overwork Leo (I beg), do this in a manner that is sustainable, in my opinion less beautifully edited videos could be sufficient, however I know it might be tough to ask it from someone who is keen on delivering high quality. An English client of mine recently overworked, he also runs a team on a shipyard, I see the same work ethic of yours in him, which is great, but I don't want you to push yourself to such a point because it's not worth it and it will take time to recover from something like that. Enjoying the ads to make your job a tiny bit less stressful, I invite people to follow. Cheers on the nice video 👌
All I can say is Leo, please continue! To watch the progress and some of the decision making process gives great pleasure to those of us who have tried to complete bigger or smaller projects.  Your day to day is terrific. I should go buy jewels for golem now. Cheers
Love the woodworking and skills shown! 👍
Enjoyed this video! Keep it up. Vary nice work!
While I am a contemporary rigger I am excited to see more videos in the future about the spars, running and standing rigging!!!
Is Patrick a Jerry Miller fan? 8;05 was one of his great songs.
Leo's English accent made me think that there would be a SPA installed on the boat. It took me a minute to realize that he drops the R from words ending in R. So it's the SPARs  that are costing a lot. Whew. Good to know
Such a great team. Thanks for the overview of the SOW, Leo. I got pretty excited to learn that the rig and sail plan are being finalised too. I hope we can get a look at some of the sail loft work, in due course? Thanks for the update.
Great video Leo I hope you make a feature of what you did at the end showing us what everybody was doing it didn't take long but was informative  I do hope that person who said they were going to pay for some work actually keeps his or her word but as you know people are full of good intentions until it comes to signing some cheques love the work that has been carried out I bet you when it's finished you will be inundated with offers to buy this amazing sailing boat for many millions as its worth so much in blood sweat and expertise and quality the amazing woods and bronze work is just sublime I have followed you since the very beginning buying the boat for one whole dollar and your videos have come on a very long way now to expert you have learned a new craft by building this boat anyway good luck for the future and all the best From John from Rugby UK .ps I will be waving you into port when you arrive in the UK cant wait to see her in person.
I've been smashing the like button since the crew was planking the frame back in Sequim.  This project has become bigger and better than ever before since then.  I hope everyone loves these videos as much as I do, especially the promos! The boat is looking great. Keep up the good work everyone.
I do enjoy the addition of these commercials... It's a fun group of talented people, no matter what they are doing...
Great video, gives perspective of the scale of the project.  And with the cast of characters you have, herding cats comes to mind.
Love this so much the ad was hilarious 🤣 love how much you all are getting into it !
If it all goes tits up, you guys would make a great comedy team
Love the commercial
Not at all boring, Leo. Fascinating to see all the work being done by your crew, in your shop and in various locations around the area. Thank you for sharing it all with us.
Love your promo vids 👍
I watch every one of your videos and absolutely love them wow you have a lot more people working at one time then I realized I wish I could support you more but I try to do my part, all of us smash that like button and comment on each video, that will maximize YouTube 💵🤑
Leo…I am sure the day you can just sail the boat is what drives you……one day soon brother!
Leo, you should add the "Thanks" button option to your videos.  Maybe not as long term useful as patreon, but I bet a lot of viewers would use it.
what ever you do i watch and enjoy always  Thank you much and thank the gang  of Carpenters
The morning meeting was grate
I cannot wait to see this girl on the water!
I like it! Found interesting what's going on behind de the video takes scenes. Congratulations for not only perfect restaurateur hability but, also an perfect project-manager
Yes it certainly has taken a life of its own Leo. But there's so much thats positive that's keep us all coming back for another dose of Tally Ho. It's the highlight of my week. Strength guys - the product is awesome
Excellent! I'm seeing the big picture.
all in all a great show about a great project, really impressive finish level throughout, many thanks
Best advert so, far, awesome!
Wow, that is one busy set of days... Well done to all on such a great project.
I spy… a nice old Auburn hanging on the wall over the sprit?
I do a lot of editing too.  Nobody who doesn't do it can comprehend how long it takes to do.  Thank you for your awesome work!
Always interesting your quality of work is first class I can’t wait for the launching
Another great video from beginning to the last second. Really cool to experience "a day in the life" with the Sampson Boat Co. crew. Sponsors will to be lining up for you and the gang to do their ads now!
...or is my medication wearing off. LOL, excellent scene.
I've been following Tally Ho's journey for more than two years now, and I am still as impressed as I was at the begining by the craftsmainship and the kindness coming from all the people who are participating in making what Tally Ho WILL be : a magnificent and free sailing Lady. Keep chuggin' along everyone, I already cannot wait for each episode so I'm not even thinking about launch, that's too far for now ^^ Anyway, awesome video, what a wonderful team, stay safe and see you next week !
Vakmanschap!
very good sponsorship - you lot know how to have fun
Amazing artisan craftsman, I have said it many times, this is a work of art…..👍
Always interesting! What a marvelous project!
The morning meeting with everyone's inner thoughts was hilarious.
Tony & Susan here, we are soo looking forward to seeing you cast off the lines.
OOOooooooooo...ancient Evinrude at 24:00!
500k subs.. wow! c'grats
Patrik having “wheels on the bus “ playing in his head had me bursting out loud in laughter 😂   Thank you for another great video!
I love all your videos. Thanks.
I’m curious about why you aren’t employing people to do the video, accounting, etc… and doing more of the woodwork yourself, if that’s what you’d prefer doing.
LEO ! ! ! Wonderful to see you this fine, spring day. I am always pleased to see the fine joinery that the crew can do. EVERY single piece is perfect in so many ways. Quality materials in a well thought out design. You well know the pro's and con's of managing a project like this. Getting your own time on the tools must be hard to do. The way you have taken up to date tech and disguised it with older, traditional and timeless is just great. Too bad I am a thousand miles north of you as I would love to be a part of this amazing project. Seeing the progression of the lady and especially the rig forming is my most favorite part. I splice dual braid lies/rope for my local hardware stores.  With or without thimbles each and every splice leaves my home in a perfect state. It is a real pleasure to see how well everyone gets along. You have a real family here. So, , , I/we eagerly await the next instalment of this wonderful lady of the seas. Take care now. Dean from northern BC Canada.
I love Tuesdays and group meetings.  Can I please come work for you?  :)
If you can move the frig/freezer forward & put the sink in the middle, your F/F compressor won't struggle when the oven/stove is used.
I'm Way behind on my videos . Last seen #95
This is the ONLY YouTube channel I make sure (100%) that I am available to watch the moment a new video is uploaded.
Man!  All hands on deck.  The crew and the .. for want of a better phrase.. contractors are just top notch, Leo!
Great to see you folks have the same thoughts as me when I attend weekly project meetings. 😂
thanks Leo and company, nice piece
Wow what a beautiful boat it will be and what a beautiful work
I'd be afraid to sail Tally Ho around the world only because of all the bespoke workmanship that has gone into her reconstruction. When she's finished she'll be the finest sailboat. To be able to stand on her deck and watch the water fly past her would be a dream.
I see the future. "Sampson's" , the TV sitcom, with the never ending wooden yacht build, and custom inbuilt advertising by the whacky workers. Sort of a Maritime "Taxi"   :-)
Blown away by the work you are all doing.
The wheels on the bus, I fell out of my chair; lmao, and still the boat gets built. Patrick, I have come to really respect the wood work you’re doing. You went there to gain skills, and you definitely have, well done.  On to what’s been bugging me for a while. You attached the cockpit coaming with bolts through the deck beams? But on two sides the tanks were hung on those same beams extending past the undersides; how did you gain access to those bolts to wrench them? I would also point out (not to be the English police) it’s, Nick and I. Who wants ice cream? could be, ME!. However, if your child was brought up very well, they would answer with, I would like some please. Leo, I know these have to be a lot of work the adds by themselves must take quite some time to put together; they are genius. I can only say I wait for the next one from the day this one is released. I’m sure I’m not alone; Great content, and it’s gotten even better over time.
Brilliant well done Leo.
I can not help thinking back to the first videos (I saw) where Leo was facing all this work single-handed.   Best to ALL and keep up the fantastic, beautiful work.
Love it thanks Leo ❤
Great video.  Love the integrated ads - I think the LOTR skit on jewellery has to be the best yet 😂😂
It's never boring, its a privilege to watch all your crew working, many thanks. Regards from the UK.
Leo, you have the best commercials on the internet. And you're an amazing guy!
Absolutely stunning to see behind the curtain.
That teak gutter brings the whole deck together.
Never forget homour, that's the secret Leo!
Appreciate the effort regards recording, producing and presenting this story Leo. What an amazing archive of memory you all will have to look back on.
Hi Leo!   Where can i find the list of photo and video equipement you are using ?
Keep it up! ❤
Are those guys getting paid for all the acting and video performances that they do?  I think the Screen Actors Guild should step in and make sure that they get paid for their acting and performance work.  They should be paid at least as much as the "Swamp People"; Troy Landry gets about $25,000 an episode. And all Troy does is hook alligators, say, "Shoot'im, Shoot'im" and help drag a dead alligator into a boat.
Been watching from the start after I found out about you while surfing YouTube while on my night job waiting for a call to put me to work. Leo, you must have a dozen things going through your head at any one time, how are you able to sleep ? Been watching since only you , Cheka and the parrot were involved. When you are finished set a course for the Marquesas. P.S. Watched the bit about the sponsor, yours is the only sponsor involved vid I watch, but, no can afford bling anymore.
All of this craftsmanship is nothing short of excellence, this boat is going to be absolutely gorgeous.  Impressive!  Looking forward to seeing Tally-Ho going into the water.
The precision of the jointery is unbelievable
Why don't you outsource your editing? You've got 9 guys working for you but you're spending 30 hours a week editing... There are lots of people out there who would edit for you and would be a lot quicker at it. Your time would then be better spent working on the project...
I see a long and illustrious career in advertising once you have finished with Tally-ho. Take care guys.
Great progress Leo and the whole team!
I have truly enjoyed watching your videos. But most did not show your management style. This video did. I knew from watching earlier and later videos that  you must have been applying a personable style of managing this awesome boat construction and building  up a dedicated  group of  helpers and craftsmen. I can only imagine that there must be times that you want to scream, because you want to get this construction done and get onto sailing, after all, that what this boat is all about. Thanks for giving me much pleasure in watching your style. God Be With You on this journey.
🙂always happy 2 se a update
Fantastic video.  It will bring more support for the project to see how much behind the camera is done!  Just keeping a daily list is great and the cooperation of the employees and crew is “hats off” to all of you for such great work.
So much creativity and craftsmanship from such a small team  - this has to be one of the best channels out there, on any media. It is the only channel that I don't fast-forward or ignore the ads on, I don't know how you all manage to keep straight faces making them 😊.
bla bla bla
Great video Leo!!
Those bronze self tailing winches aboard the Rhodes 27 are the coolest thing ever. I didn't know such a thing even existed and now i can't imagine any other kind of winch aboard Tally Ho.
Leo working 125% of the time. Welcome to the world of most small business owners.
Magnificent upload as per usual Leo. What an effort by all involved.
wheels on the bus go.... instant like
More of the bowsprit guy please!
@Blue Nile. I love their ads. I never fast forward through them. What a lovely hobbit ❤
Great Video blog of a day of the life of Team Tall Ho!. Loved the Hobbit  advert!.
It must have been so very tempting to slightly modernise and improve the spa and sail rig.
teak gutter!?
I hope that makita planer has gone to good use for you! Ill send some more stuff soon :)
Do not underestimate a basin you can fit your hands in. Inversely you are not likely to appreciate the annoyance of a basin you cannot get your hands into until each and every single time you use it.
Some say you cant go over 100% a candle burning at both ends is 200%
Another great sponsor commercial and great craftsmanship!
OUTSTANDING JOB LEO, U HAVE ONE HELLOVA CREW OF FANTASTIC CRAFTSMEN ‼️‼️⛵️ Vinny 🇺🇸
It is an honour to contribute to this project. You are creating a work of art. What an amazing team you have built too. It looks so much fun.
It will be interesting to see where your YouTube channel goes, when the boat is finished and sailing.  Hopefully you decide to continue, showing sailing and maintaining boat. Best channel on YouTube
You had never on the edge of my seat with the rudder and the mast just to not see much of then lol
Absolutely great video showing everything going on.
If the whole boat building thing doesn't work out for you guys, perhaps have a go at comedy writing!  Too funny!🤣
Ian is a great guy! You guys keep rocking
Hire a an editor and videographer and output 2 or 3 videos a week.
Good video.  Keep 'em coming.
Talented crew ,nice wood work.
Love the commercials and th3boat work.
Patrick is also working on zany new characters for the comedy skits and sourcing cheap donuts. He gets all the fun jobs cause hes not serious.
Love the sponsorship ads I actually watch them because they're hilarious
Brilliant, more of this type of videos please.
Your commercials are so awful, that they're great.
I just want to say That I Think everyone on this Project is doing an Amazing Job and I So enjoy Seeing the progress.. Cheers!
I've watched from the beginning, and I can say that for myself there has never been a boring episode. Every aspect of this project has been fascinating.
Leo, it’s a great work what you and your crew is doing. I would say the boat will be a piece of art.
Hang in there Leo! I hope you find a way to stay sane during this busy period in your life. Just know we are all routing for  you and your team to succeed. You are all amazing! 👍
Always a favorite for me!
Ich bin wirklich gespannt, wie das fertige Boot aussehen wird...
uUhH, ToLkIeN nEveR SaYs gOlluM iS a HoBbIt, bUt "SoMeThInG vERy MuCh lIkE A hObBit"
Love that teak gutter! :)
My 10-year-old neighbor was very impressed with your jewelry ad. We had a lengthy conversation about who was the funniest.
Well done 👍
"Come for the commercials, stay for the boat building. "
What a great episode.
Mmm. Not sure he is spending his time properly then. Should get a media wannabe intern to do the video/editing and a paid admin bod to do the paperwork.   Then he would have more than 25% of his time back to be hands on. I don’t think people are financially supporting him so he can sit behind a desk! Wana see sweat and bullets.. :)
Incredible ❤
Love it every time!
I have a fridge that has an upper access and it is nothing but a nuisance.  You will be co scantly moving things off the small counter above your fridge to get into things….a slide out access may be better.  Good luck.
Yes Leo all that boring paperwork, yet remember the voyage and the journey ahead once you splash that keel into the water!
I look forward to you  when you release you're next program I've given up on the BBC HTV I'm sure they do good stuff I wouldn't know I just given up on them I also watch the German guy my first boat and across the UK one ship happens I'm quite sure I've heard they mention you
What a wonderful crew.
cool Video format and the best ads i have ever seen. this is the only channel where im always watching the adds and dont skipping through.
I,m sad, been watching this from the very beginning, but not as sad as the people who buy a boat, rip the inside out to do a refit without realising how much time effort and money goes into putting it back together. The small fiddly bits and interior are always the hardest, I really do take my hat off to you guys.
Amazing to get an insight into the process, and to see how your videos evolve and improve over time. Wonderful work in your videos lately, with great music, concise explanations of very complex processes, and a great sense of narrative to the progress on the boat.  I don't remember which episode it was in which you said (to paraphrase): "It's starting to look like a boat!"
This video has just highlighted what a massive project this is. I can't afford much but I look forward to your videos every fortnight so much I have just signed up as a Patreon.
Lol got to love the commercials
I've been watching since the hull was worked on at your first location.  Now that I see the expertise needed, and the time it takes to make any progress, I was wondering if you know how long it took to build the boat originally?
This is the best channel on YouTube.
The morning meeting scene made me laugh out loud! Some of your best work team 🤣🤣
Dude, these are hands down the greatest ads I see on YouTube. Genuinely the only ones I don't scrub through. High value entertainment right there!
Love the vlogs, I've been watching for what seems like decades, and i thoroughly enjoy every single episode, however, the million dollar question is when do you think the big splash will be?
Great video, Leo. Great narrative, editing, takes. And, great team you built around Tally Ho. Talk about Tally Ho - it's going to be the real deal again. Wow.
How you run this project week in week out is amazing.
Nice to see Tally ho and Pellew got a quick mention in Harry Dwyers last video, shame about the empty promise of the spars funding!
Leo you’re awesome. Keep up the amazing work
Love the vid, thank you
Have you mentioned what your plan is for Tally Ho once you complete the project?
Faucet! Your going native Leo!!!! 😂😂
What an amazing project you're all working on. Makes my 30 ft trawler feel like a breeze! I am learning so much watching you all, thank you. We've only had our boat not long, and we believe we'll be tackling the drop knees under the steering first - at least that's my understanding - I'm still learning, glad my partner is experienced and knowledgeable. I am learning how to use an orbital sander and belt sander, something new for me, and that probably sounds stupid, but it's exciting learning new skills. Thanks so much for your very inspiring videos, they're great!
Smeagle is indeed, as you say. er. Beautiful.
You better belive it, it's been true for years. I am stickking to the end.
As always great video. Great crew
Better than interesting...this video was fascinating...your managment efforts are yielding brilliant results!  The project is FLYING along.  I know you would rather have it in the water already but this is a LARGE project and THAT came through loud and clear!  This will be a beautiful sailing work of art...I mean who else has a gutter made out of teak? I truly wish I could be there to take the video editing off your hands....so you could do something else you do so brilliantly...hands on boatbuiding.  You are absolutely correct about the 1 hour to do 1 minute of video editing...and that is true only if you are good...and you are!  Carry on!
You've come a long, long way since it was just you hammering out the keel bolts all alone in the dark. WOW! It's been a fun journey. Thanks for taking us along for the ride.
Head's up for the deaf people watching this video: The reference to rabbits was probably not about the animal with long ears. The closed captions for that should have been rabbet which is a groove made along the edge of a board.
By far my favourite YouTube channel, hats off to you sir for your vision, inspiration, and hard work ! Many would have folded a long time ago but you have evolved and made a business with a process unknown when Tally Ho was originally built, well done to you and the whole team, keep up the hard work and looking forward to the next one already 👍
bronze basin looks super cool :) x nice to have some vintage boat bits in there!
Never boring.
Such great work on a beautiful boat.  Thanks for the view.
Love it👍
The group meeting at the beginning was hilarious. I haven’t watched another YT channel that integrates humor as well as this this channel.
Of was verry interesting this video thanks end its beutifull wath you all are doing
I'm sure this is has been asked a hundred times over, but can we get some Sampson Boat Co merch?  I'd buy a shirt and I'd absolutely love a hat with the logo.
totally Fascinating thank you
Why do you not employ a project manager in the same way you employ other trades people? You are obviously very good at it and have ownership over the project, but it seems a shame for you to miss out on the woodwork you are so skilled in.   I have watched your channel since the 4th video and loved every minute, wishing you well from England!
Leo, this was highly interesting, as will the episode on the spars and the episode on the rudder will undoubtedly be. On the other hand, I guess you would not be able to make an uninteresting video, even when you would plan to do so. This channel is by far my favorite YouTube channel, even when I'm not a boat builder. My marine experience is sailing a somewhat larger inflatable boat with an outboard engine, for scuba diving at locations in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean where we cannot go by car. My woodworking experience is creating furniture out of scrap wood, mainly pallets.
at no point am I bored  great to watch
The wheels on the bus really cracked me up
Patrick may have a career in acting.
Best show on youtube!! 😀
Best sponsor segments in the game
It seems to be some unwritten law of the universe when you become the boss, spearhead, project manager you must surrender your skills that put you there to your new desk job - where you don't do anything that got you there. At 125% I'd say you're doing pretty good haha... I had a guy tell me once running his own repair business - "It's not the 16 hrs. a day that gets to me, it's the second 16 hrs." It's always a pleasure to watch. Thanks for sharing
The only sponsor ads I watch -  brilliant at as always. 😆👍
I like and commendable the dynamic of these craftsmen/ craftswomen . And they’re having fun while  doing the sponsors skit commercial ( it makes me laugh) and working at the same time.  More power to all of you and keep up the good work.
I'm glad that they're all paid now.  Makes it feel less like a cult.
Great Video !
Leo, You and your team are unbelievable.  I'm in awe of the complexity of the project.  Good luck to you all.
I have been watching from the start Leo you videos are a pleasure to watch the progress you have made is astounding and I look forward to future broadcasts.... Best wishes to you all
It couldn’t be more interesting. It’s the reality. It’s what it takes. The complexity is really unknown. You’re showing it well! Tally Ho will be exceptional. So happy for you and all the crew you’ve brought into this project. Love it!!!!
Very nice to meet the crew more informally. As I was sure was the case was how much work is taking place and how much time and effort goes into keeping us informed
I loved your commercial 😀
Great job Leo! I’m thinking about visiting Port Townsend this summer and would like to know if it is safe? Are there a lot of liberals rioting around the marina like in other parts of the north west? Are conservatives welcome?
Well done, one and all. I hope you take time to look after yourself too, Leo. Brilliant work and thanks to you all.
Can't get enough of this project. Everything is so well designed and built. The videos are always excellent. Thanks Leo for bringing us along for the ride
You guys and gal are amazing I loved the commercial and Leo I am a small business landscaper and handyman in the start I loved those two fields and everyone needs both so why not.  I find myself being more of a marketer and bookkeeper than I ever did in any job i ever had.
SO I wonder after Leo takes a vacation on Tally ho and sails around the world, what boat is he going to buy for a $1 and bring these fine craftspersons together again, you have an amazing work ethic and an amazing team you put together.  Good luck!
Thank you!
Great video as always but dude... that gutter! *chef's kiss*
Your Adds are amongst the few I actually watch since I'm in the UK because they are so funny boats looking great you have an outstanding crew of craftsmen there Best Regards from Liverpool
Awesome job ! Ttop notch commercial 😂
No nyt oli mielenkiintosta settiä👍
The craftsmanship of your crew is absolutely amazing!
Thank you Leo for your work
Comment, thank you and love it.
This channel is inspiring.
I hope the person pledging to pay the rigging comes through...
Never ever boring, Leo!  Wellllll; except maybe for Pat!!!   LOLOLOLOL 😂😂😂!!!  An exceptionally great group of people, crafting and equally exceptional beautiful wooden boat!!!
You need to find someone to edit your videos for you. Would take a lot of weight off your back
Love the sponsorship content! Leo, and Crew do it better than ANY other YT'r out there! Genuine gut laughter out of these vids!!!
Where does Leo find the time to even like some of these comments?
The whole project is amazing if not mind boggeling, and there is a lot more to it then meets the eye for sure. Nice to get a glimpse of that. And yes, the teak gutter looks amazing!
I would accept a little less quality in the video, provided I just got more of them.  Just carry a camera around during the day, and upload the next morning.  Call them "rush" videos, or Dailies.  You could then still make your bi-weekly masterpieces, while increasing your YouTube income by some large factor.  Here's an idea, give the camera to a different member of the team each day to film the dailies.
Have to say how beautiful boat leo. You have some great woodworking men or should I say Marine cabinet woodworker's I've been a journeyman painter work on millions of dollars homes I don't believe they touch your crew's
Great episode...It touched a nerve... I humbly offer my observation. I'm thinking I might have been on a similar journey, I was a screen printer, and then 30 years later there were 120 employees..I bet you didn't think you would be responsible for 10 extraordinarily talented individuals on the day you paid your 1$..on my day one...I didn't.  Getting dragged into admin was the bane of my working day. You mentioned in the video about focus on the vision..it was this that day to day I worried about most.  Bills will get paid, things will get done when all the ducks are in a row....its only business!... and you are a legitimate business. I really think your next employee should be an admin genius.....The vision...thats where your skill is, treasure it... give it up lightly. Leo I'm not saying you are but its a slow creep. Really, all the best..you are part of a great team of your design. I wish you all well.   It really was a fascinating episode.🙂
I have never owned a boat. I ran across this channel years ago and have been following ever sense.  It amazes me all the terms and names of different parts of a sailboat. the craftmanship of these people is fantastic..
very interesting and informative and entertaining video Leo. Thanks
As an amateur student of human consciousness, I found the insight into the thought process of your crew to be of profound interest.
One question remains unanswered: Whas Sauron edited off and who played him? 😁
Truly AWESOME! Been watching from the beginning, can't wait for the next episode. When she's finnely finished, I would LOVE to take a tour. The problem is, no more construction videos 😢. Thanks for the entertainment.
Living the dream is hard work😀. Well done.
You guys make those commercials so much fun. Great work 👍 and great team 👍.
Exactly what I imagined Patty’s brain sounded like
Bring on the Rig!
Very serous professional work no BS 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
One of the best videos yet. Great seeing a day in the life!
Management = laying the track down as fast as you can...while a train is coming up behind you, AND, putting out random fires along the way. I'd much rather be a worker-bee. Love the content! Keep it coming!
I had no idea all your staff were paid. I'd presumed they were all volunteers except for 1 part time shipwright. I was wondering "how can all these people afford to spend so much of their time working on a boat, wouldn't the joy of it wear off after a while?", but figured with how large your reach is, there's still enough people like that. Instead I've discovered now that the financing for this project must be far beyond what I imagined. Your wages alone must be low 6 figures even if everyone is taking a paycut out of charity. And it's also a bit sad, as, managing people is the least rewarding part of the operation but the thing you spend almost all of your time doing instead of building a boat. I suppose it would take 20 years if you did it all yourself though. One day you'll get to just ... sail... what a difference from the frantic pace of construction for so many years. You're world class at everything you do Leo.
Well done!
Your videos are always my first to watch each week. The level of skill from all the craftsmen is inspiring to see Leo. An amazing glimpse into a world rarely seen in today's crazy rat race
I think you ALL have missed your true calling as advertisement ‘actors’…although you all are fantastic shipwrights & carpenters, your product advertisements are true perfection! 🤣😂
Extremely interesting! Wow!! Cheers, Ian in Blackpool, UK
Have a session that is pure adverts.  I will watch the whole hour as they are so funny!!
Great project, great team, incredible details in description and quality. Just remember that Leo is the guy that make us 40 minutes video on sharping chisel and we didn’t lost a minute on it with real interest and pleasure, respect.
What a job you all are doing the videos are a joy to watch!
A day in the life…☮️
Your ads are best and most cringe worthy on YT! We’ll done. Yours are the only ones I’ll actually watch.
I was surprised to learn that you have employed a 10 person crew.
I’ve been a fan and supporter of this project pretty much from the start. Love all the videos, and cannot believe how much I enjoy the scripted advertising.  Really big fun.   Incredible Team led by the incredible Leo.  I vote that Patrick is part of the crew when you finally do sail away. Just install a small Kiln so he can continue his remarkable Pottery habit.  Regards
Yet another excellent video update Leo & Crew! Loved seeing all of those dovetail joints being fabricated. All of the crew horsing around was fun to watch! Keep up the great work! 👍👍
125% ? You are a Machine, Leo.  :D
BEST ADS EVER
Love love love the integrated ads! They always make my day!
Really enjoyed a 31:21 day in the life!!
well time to rewatch lotr
Leo my friend  your soon sailing  ? It's been  a long time getting  TALLY HO  Sea worthy again  are you excited to  launch ?  Your  the new captain on her will  you solo or have a crew  on the madian voyage  ? AND MOST IMPORTANT where will you sail to and will you post your voyage ? Great build and a great guy and  crew you got  building  her Thumbs-up on your  journey  it's  been a fantastic  adventure  !
In case anyone was wondering, his truck 'had' 162,327 miles at the time of recording.  Not that it matters, other than as a fun fact, and shows my pause game in on point. Support if you can, watch these videos and share them if you cannot, and Tally Ho!
It takes a lot of hands to craft a hand-made boat (engineered like a very large piece of fine furniture).
I found myself going back to episode 19 this morning... the journey to the "deep south" where Leo bought live oak timbers for Tally Ho.  I've watched videos many times, reminding myself what an amazing journey Leo has shared with all of us.  Tally Ho is becoming a gorgeous sailing boat.  I'm glad I've made a modest contribution each month and happy others are supporting this venture as well.  I agree, this is really the very best channel on YouTube.  Watching these men and women create such beauty is a delight.  Thanks Leo.  I loved this overview and look forward to a more detailed look at what is happening right now.
This is just a little reminder to Leo, that I and the multitude of others who await tremulously the next installment of Tally Ho and then devour avidly said installment, (when it arrives) is more appreciative of these than perhaps you understand and absolutely more in awe of the tenacity and sheer bloody-mindedness required to stick with; and irrespective of many negative happenings  (in the background) remain effusive and positive in the face of..............well, anything and everything, well done Leo.
Not boring
28:10 2 flux capacitors ?😯
Always interesting !!
6hrs + 2hrs + 2hrs = 10hr day.... math works for me
Looks like she'll be in the water by this time next year?
One part varnish one part sawdust one part humor … mix well and down the hatch with a tally ho cocktail. Thanks as always to Leo and his excellent crew.
😂 I never would have believed it but for the first time ever I am actually looking forward to the add in a YouTube episode. Thank you! Also, of course, wonderful to see Tally Ho come back to life step by step. 🙂
Top class workmanship.wicked ad as usual and a great team.
This is gotta be the greatest YT channel with the cringiest sponsorship ads, lol.
Love your humor.
Great video, fascinating ty
A happy crew is a loyal crew.
Very Interesting. Thanks team Tally Ho.
Always interesting!
Best Blue Nile commercial ever.😂 Wasn't Nick also working on the front door ?
Best video yet.
I’m not an emotional person but I can honestly say I laugh to tears when “wheels on the bus” came on
Loved the "day in the life" style of video.  I nice contrast to the usual project based videos.  Almost felt like we got a behind the scenes look at world of Sampson Boat Company.
Hes not wrong, you rarely see a teak gutter!
Great job to everyone,  cant wait to see more .
Peter Jackson would be jealous of that smeagol impression, top quality acting from the entire cast.
Another great video!
The rare shipwright hobbit
Interesting!
Who is concentrating on the front door project...?
I just have to tell you that yours is the only channel that I do NOT fast forward through the paid promotion!  Bravo to you all and your creativity!
Definitely love behind the scenes stuff like this, more of it if you have the content!
Can I get a playlist of your ads. They are too good
It was VERY interesting - ty Leo
Beautiful work from all the people involved
Great video Leo and team :) Can't wait to meet Tally Ho when you one day sail her back to Bristol :)
😂 smegill
I have to say that the ads are getting much better as far as entertainment quality! Patty is a rip and the beards were awesome. If all the ads on YouTube were as entertaining , nobody would have have use for an adblocker. They almost match the level of quality as the craftmanship that has gone into the rest of the project, cheers.
Never boring and alway entertaining, has made me want to build my own wooden boat.
It is a very nice teak gutter
Hi every one. It's a good thing that people are paid for this incredible job but later, saying they've been involded in this projetct will be forever priceless. Congrats to all of you from France.
Maybe melt down the bronze sink and cast a new bespoke one?
Not the kind of winches I was expecting.     Thought they would be electrical
I think it was probably this channel most of all that sealed the deal that I wanted to become a boatwright.
Wonderful video, as usual. Thanks so much. I love your ads. You captured the essence of every meeting I've been in, in my 40+ years of work.
Leo & Crew - you are very welcome for my support.  It's not a fortune, but I'm glad it helps.  Yours is the best TV I watch.  So, thank YOU!
With the challenges with my health, I love the humor segments throughout the video. They crack me up and it makes me enjoy your videos even more so. Thanks.
Good Leo, yes this was a very interesting episode. I must say, I am always impressed on just how meticulous your shop runs. Great group of people and some of the most talented Craftsman I've seen working on boats, and I've been around boating for over 40 years. So once again great job great video.
Great stuff as always
I love watching the crew working  a flat peace of wood and turning it in something as beautiful as useful. Last century wood boat building was commun but today to be able to witness it is for me a privilege.
Leo, you should rightfully so sail Tally Ho for a year or two, sell her to a deserving owner, then come right back with this crew to build another beautiful classic.
It is easy to go beyond 100%.  It just depends on the standard being used.  If the standard is 40 hours a week and you are working 50, then boom, 125% (though I'm guessing your spending a few more hours then that)
Your sponcer advertisments are the only ones I watch. I love the way your team makes the add entertaining. 😂
I'm not even very interested in boats or boat building, but the videography and the great comradeship (plus the super funny ads) make these videos a huge pleasure to watch! Great stuff
Ads are always my favorite part love that you make the best of it
Thank gods you guys are doing boats not tv ads 🙈
Wonderful episode!
Love your videos, could watch it every day🔥
Thanks!
Leo: You also do all the expediting of all materials as well.  I don’t see how you are keeping your sanity.
I get your math Leo - I especially enjoyed the third half of this episode!
Grate work with the video's,  day in the life. Plus I like the job/project focus video as you can see things coming together.  And I think you adds for sponsorship are the best on YouTube
Leo! I'd love to know what editing software you use. Yes, I understand the recorded time vs. editing time (nothing new there).  Anyway, you've attracted an amazing crew of dedicated folks who are doing an incredible job on all they do. (They're also very helpful for your sponsored adverts!). Been watching you from very early on (I binge-watched the earlier videos from where I started). I'm sorry I can't contribute monetarily (retired, fixed income), but I always leave a thumbs up, and have commented on many occasions-- positively. I look forward to your vids, and queue them up as they appear. I can't wait to see Tally-Ho! splash!
If someone? Interested in a job in ship and yacht installations. There is enough work in the Netherlands. For example, at Heinen and Hopman. Bunschoten Spakenburg. The Netherlands.
Brilliant Episode!... As usual! Thank you.
Great video Leo. Never boring. An amazing insight into what it takes to keep a complex project like this going. You have a fantastic team of skilled and dedicated craftsman working with you. It’s great to see how the less experienced in the team have grown alongside the time served shipwrights.
Leo in my opinion you have one of the most, interesting, fun, well produced channels with just a huge amount of knowledge imparted to all of us viewers. It does my heat good to know there are still dedicated craftsmen to the trades involved in your restoration. cheers!
Showing your Mac laptop video editing setup, you're already doing a promotion for Apple. I wonder if you could get paid for that somehow. Cheers!
Yourself and Ran are my top two Vloggers
Like, subscribe and donate!  Thanks for a great video.  Was in Seattle this past summer and drove through the boatyard and got a peak at Tally Ho.  Great seeing shots of the yard and the town.
I always look forward to your next video and this one was over the top! lol,,,Lots of interesting things going on and throwing in some fun too! Love it!
That's a nice gutter!
No need to apologize about the integrated ads, this project is massive and there's a lot to consider. We love the work you all do ❤️
I hope that they are better ship Wrights than they are actors.
An excellent video overview of the complex world of Tally Ho.  I'm in complete agreement that this project has evolved into one of the most impressive endeavors I have had the pleasure of following.  Very well done ✔✔✔
So far you have not released any boring videos. This was a good format to make us understand how the teams works nowadays. Also interesting so see how one man's vision from the first videos has turned into a regular business. I still love your project Leo, and meeting all people and animals involved.
Leo  Thanks  for all your diligent  work on these videos.😅 Many decades ago my father salvaged a motor sailer and l have some turnbuckle. Been trying to figure out what to do with them 😢.  Any thoughts?
Great work guys I'm so impressed
That bronze basin is awesome. Definitely worth the extra effort. Poor Nic. He's got too much hair anyway (I'm jealous)
Quite a workforce to do the work on Tally Ho ... all the different shops doing different jobs ... so much to do ... this has to be one of the most involved efforts of a old refit from the keel up ... Great job ... keep up the good work ... a big Fan from day one ...😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Another video from Tally Ho wooden sailboat ⛵️! Enjoy video ! Mike from Missouri
You get to be at work by 8?! What luxury
Hey Leo, great insight to your guys day. I know costs are always tight but it seems like you should be outsourcing your office and booking keeping work as getting someone or a firm that is quicker and more efficient may well work out cheaper, compared tp the cost of you doing it yourself (given how valuable your time is as a project manager and shipwright). Just a thought, keep up the good work.
Honestly I have began watching these videos for the adds and it just so happens after the adds they are building a boat as well.
Sailboat for $1.00*  * Some assembly required.
Great overview. Keep up the good work. Xx
This the only channel where I watch the sponsored segments in full. You guys are absolute legends :))
are the beards in the Blue Nile commercial made of oakum?
The advertisement bit was exceptional.  Smeagol  is pretty!
Wheels on the bus 😂.... that meeting had me 😂
seriously... WHERE IS THE DUCHESS OF DESIRE?
Nice work - Super pro!
My favorite YouTube channel. Don't know if Leo is acting... how could someone be so nice and so knowledgeable at his age?
This rebuilding is getting more complicated and interesting...thought the sink would be closer to the middle line ..😎😄
Great episode Leo! Thanks 🙂
this imperial units drives me mad. 1-10-100 is so much cooler.
It's great that you keep mixing things up with the videos. Keeps them fresh and interesting. It's also impressive that you have the energy to do any boat-building yourself.
Never get tired of your ads. Hilarious.
Ordinarily I skip past inline ads and make sure never to buy from them, but YOUSE GUYS did such an entertaining job (like the last one) that I would love to look into those products.  Very very well done ladies and gents!
I determined my maximum donation to a "builder's channel" based on what I donated to Leo.  I wish I could afford to do it again, maybe I can? White Spot Pirate, Nike Stieger, bless her heart, helped me determine the max donation to a "sailing channel" in 2019.  So SV Sampson or Tall -leo could win twice when Leo takes us sailing.  I'm going to miss the build, but...rewind!!  I'ts probably been considered already but a few dash cams  and a few gopros, perhaps a high mast cam, would provide unsupervised stock video footage and could be installed in nice wooden boxes.  The future sailing channel will be epic!!
It's always a good day when Leo drops a Tally Ho video!
This video is Wonderfully Fantastically Awesomeness Extreme…beyond words… I’m not crying, you are.  Much Love and Hugs
Leo, in regards to all of the various pieces of wood working: rudder, hatches, coamings, skylights, the kitchen layout, drawers, cabinets, sink, plumbing, etc., how do all of these ides go from something in the mind to a final installed project?  If something were to tragically happen to the entire boat today, are their drawings available to builder her from the ground up, again?  I had no idea of very busy you are each day.  I do appreciate your difficult job.  Have a good day, sir!
Not sure anymore what days your videos come out , seems like different  days now
Hi, Leo. What software do you use to edit the videos?
Ohh, the police in the background. Love that song.  Love the videos too. Been watching since the start. Such beautiful work by everyone.
Epoxy squeeze-out shot was soooo satisfying!
Do you make those dovetails with pins for waterproofing?
The details are spectacular. Tally Ho will once again be the majestic masterpiece she was intended to be thanks to you, your crew, your supporters and of course, the format that uas brought you here, You Tube. Great job Leo.!
What a great video! and I didn't know there is an online jeweler.
Phew ! you can see why Fibreglass boats were invented, the labour content of this project is biblical, such a happy crew though !!
Wow, great video as always.  Please don't skip a week.  It upsets the balance of the world and the earth spins slower for a week.  What a large working crew and great craftsmanship.  I love how your videos appreciate everyone and how individual they all are and the craft they bring to the boat.  I think you would benefit from having a proper camera operator/videographer to free up your creative leadership.
Loved this day in a life: gives me a better idea what is going on and who is doing what
If anything this video shows that this channel doesn't need as much editing. More content and honest bullshittery is so nice to see.  Iam not complaining, love the current format but I'd just as much like 2 vids a week with less editing
Loving it😊 The detail work is gorgeous.
Hi Leo, You have a great team and its obvious they all get on well together. The boat is is coming along as well and you have some very talented people in the team. Once finished you will easily get a job as a film maker/director without a problem, even if it is a comedy. Cheers and good luck. Ian
Great stuff Leo.... hope to shake your hand one day! 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
6.2K+ subscriber LIKE; 32,280th desktop looky-loo view.
Utterly awesome thankyou.  In hysterics at the meeting scene!
This should be the way all ads on YouTube must be, acted out.
Interesting Video! Your Day's must have more Hour's than 24. . .  ;-)
2:55 to 3:13 was the best laugh I’ve had all week. 🤣
You are building so much more than a boat.
The ads are as amazing as the boat building. Sampson Boat & Marketing Co :)
this video gave liveliness to the project. ❤
With the economy going to sh*t this project  is going to get very exciting/nerve-wracking toward the end.  I wish I was a rich man I'd donate so much money to this.  What an amazing boat.
Thanks Leo
Thanks to you and the crew - never a bad episode.
Thank you :)
Real ! Reality TV without the ridiculous theatrics
You make some of the most fun advertisement breaks that are out there. If you keep on being creative like that soon I will only come back to watch you adds ;-). Please tell that you the companies that over you such deals; really really fun watch. And incredible work all you do there! Cheers, Norman
Ta Leo
4:07,  Soo, Sampson Boat Co. , this is where John Bolton is hiding out.....
⭐⭐
Such a great project. Great work guys! Everything looks beautiful.
💖💖💖
Good typecasting in the sponsor part 😄 Fantastic woodwork and fun too see a bit "behind the camera" Best YT-channel!
Great stuff as usual
Things are looking fabulous on Tally Ho.
💗it
get office help
Your videos are never boring. I laughed out loud with the audio for your team "meeting."
Another brilliant video Leo. I have to say I’ve watched your journey to rebuild Tally-Ho from the start and have loved every minute of it, you and the crew are doing incredible and inspiring work I can’t wait to see her in the water👍
Simply well done. Thank you Leo
I so look forward to every other Saturday and wait anxiously for Leo's post.  I've been following for over 3 years, fancy myself as a pretty good woodworker/joint builder.  My work can't hold a candle to the intricacy of the joints/fits these craftsmen and artists turn out.  While I can't wait to see Tally Ho under sail, I will be sad to see the day when she is completed.  Phenomenal work team and crew of Tally Ho, you are making history.
Remarkably talented people you all are 👍.
I can't wait until you are finally finished, for your sake. Thank you for giving us a piece of this future history.
I've been following this channel for about two years now. Amazing project, people and spirit you guys have there! Also, literally only adds in any channel I wont skip and actually am looking forward to watch. :D Greetings from Finland!
I’m still confused. If you aren’t going to install a front door how do you expect to have your pizzas and Amazon packages delivered?
Hiya Leo
In my opinion, if Leo made a 30 minute video containing nothing but this amazing woodwork being varnished and then just watching it dry, it would not be boring.
your ADS are the BEDS ah BEST. Nice in English tradition...
I'm amazed!
Really appreciate the crew’s spirit and humor.  Great team!
Loved commercial. A wonderful take on LOTR!
To say youve come a long way since this started is an understatement. But the fact that you have a group of master crafstpeople on the team that you trust to see your vision through, and who also seem to get along and work great together, is a joy to see. Its a beautiful thing you've built, and the boat isn't too shabby either. Thanks for taking us along for the ride.
Your crew is great, Leo! Skits and all. I will be happy for you when the project is finished, but sad because there will be a hole in my Saturday YouTube viewing. Bummer about the person promising to fund the spars and then backing out. There is a special place for people like that. Thank you for taking the high road! Blessings, all.
Thank you all very much
@3:03 “Funny!" @3:05 *can't keep from laughing*
Not boring at all, thank's
This is a wonderful series. I love seeing that old craftsmanship is still 'alive & kicking'! I have two gnawing questions: How is this project being financed? Old money, mortgage, benefactor? What is the ultimate future of this boat? Private yacht, rental/lease, maritime training, living museum? I can only hope you have another boat-build planned after the conclusion of Tally-Ho!
You should’ve started getting sponsors a long time ago just for the ad content. I actually look forward to them.
Wow Leo, what a great crew you have. Their passion shows in their work and they are enjoying each other. I'll watch this video many times. Great editing.
Wow, another interesting and fun video! It's amazing how much work goes on behind the scenes, not to mention the work of editing the videos that we get to enjoy. Even the commercials are worth watching!!! Thanks for another entertaining time with the team! Cheers.
I have enjoyed the extended video.  Lots of interesting details and glimpses of the personalities of those doing the work to make the project.  Rob
Having been with you from the very beginning, I seem to remember the foggy day when you first climbed aboard tally Ho. I recall thinking "This boat is a wreck. How on earth is Leo going to restore it." Little did I know that the original Tally Ho was only a template for the future iteration of this famous boat. I actually think you should  call the new boat "Tally Ho II" so little remains of the old boat. But I see your point of trying to extend the history of the original so that it becomes seamless. Many years from now people will not think about how little of the original remains. They will just think of Tally Ho as being a 175/200 year old classic sailing yacht and I know that would please you. Congratulations; you actually pulled it off.
I doubt very much that you are getting paid as much as those brilliant commercials are worth.
It’s a teak gutter! Love it :)
People who drive with open mugs of coffee are sources of chaos and are not to be trusted.
It's amazing the amount of work that goes into this project. You are all producing a true work of art. 👍👍👍
How much of the original Tally Ho is in this boat? I’ve been watching from almost the beginning and it seems you’ve rebuilt everything. This is truly amazing.
Appreciate your time to share your experiences with Tally Ho
Great video!
Greetings from Poland :)
It's too late for this year, but is there an exhibition class or similar for the 2025 Fastnet race? What a fantastic thing it would be to see Tally Ho reliving her heritage.
Such an impressive amount of work!
It'll be great to finish the Tally Ho, but a shame to end everything else, so don't!
Great video. Thanks Team Tally Ho!
Really great work EVERYONE!  The LOTR skit was funny.  I liked the cool bronze sink.  Shined up that would be pretty awesome.  Thank you for these videos!
Another awesome video. It's the behind the scenes videos that really tie it all together and provides a true picture into the scope of the project and the way that it is presented is very entertaining. This 32:25 video went by soo fast and the camera work, audio and editing is spot on. Thank you Leo and crew for has us on your voyage... Cheers.
I've been following since day one; it's mind blowing following the process.
Was watching a 4 year old clip of Leo by himself in the tent - this morning, and marveling at the progress from an old hulk to now . .. .
I won't say I want to have "more of this" But it was very interesting and is a good angle to look at what's going on! Really: What a development from lonely Leo setting up the first part of the boatshed up in Sequim to him running a veritable enterprise in Port Townsend! As a solo video, this may not be the best you ever did - but in the context, I think it was something very useful for anyone who wants to understand what goes on around Tally Ho.
I love Leo's skill in managing this project.  I've thought about it many times over the years of watching this channel. I've worked for many project managers over the last 45 years in the steel fabrication industry, drawing shop and field installation dwgs for structural steel buildings, bascule, lift & swing bridges, etc. Some PMs are good and some not so good. A good project manager can make a complex, difficult project flow smoothly and prevent "fires".  Their value to a job and my personal sanity is priceless.
The acting and production values in the adverts is beyond compare. Bravo!
Leo,  i've watched every episode from the start and always been amazed at the precision you and the team get with the woodwork etc.  I guess it's more a case of measure ten times,  cut once than the normal expression,  but is there any evidence of times when ten times wasn't enough and something went horribly askew?  I know you put the people bloopers at the end,  but what about showing us some build disasters?
Those dovetails with the tongue and groove... This is the first time I am aroused by woodworking.
Is that a Chris Shcwarz Dutch tool chest? 1:10
Would adding Merch such as hats and hoodies be an added value... not only that, You'd be dressing people worldwide. Imagine when Your finished and we begin following You on Your voyages and You go into a port in Europe and BAM! Someones sportin a Sampson Boat Co. Tally Ho Hoodie!
Fantastic insight into the whole thing, thank you :-) You could do one on all you ad-slot outtakes!
enjoyed it!
What an unbelievable crew you have and have had.  Every person is great.  The qualitative aspects of each is just amazing.  You might not want to share this information but I would like to know how much this has cost so far.  Certainly more than a million dollars.  I have made a couple of minor contributions but if I was not living on a small pension in Italy I would certainly donate more.
Absolutely loved it. This is a highlight of my couple of weeks, thank you so much.
Polite request: I wonder if you could summarize the major remaining tasks and anticipated spans.
Starting to feel like you need a volunteer who loves bureaucracy more than boats now. :) Awesome to see what this project has become, with all the people who do such excellent work.
Adds as well done as that one I dont mind watching one bit.
I absolutely love this channel, the crew, the project…I feel personally invested in it and I’ve never even seen the boat or met anyone working on the boat. The videos bring me joy, unlike so much of the worlds so called “entertainment”.   Leo has to be one of the hardest working individuals on you tube.  Always self introduced as a “boat builder and a sailer”, but in truth, he is so much more.  He’s a both a boat builder and sailer, but he’s a documentary film maker, a producer, a camera man, an editor.  He also is a CEO, CFO, CTO, Human Resources specialist, project coordinator, public relations specialist, accounts payable and accounts receivable specialist, supply manager, and historian.  Leo is a craftsman and detail wood worker on top of all this.  It’s remarkably impressive the talent and skills wrapped up in this one person.  And of course, it can only be accomplished because of his Passion.  When you have passion, all those skills not directly tied to the thing you’re most passionate about, but necessary to accomplish that which you are passionate about, you naturally figure them out.   Leo is essentially working 3 jobs with great skill, when he’s finished and he launches Tally Ho, that will be the best and most deserved “vacation” ever (but we all know  sailing a boat and maintaining a wood boat is not a vacation LOL).   Thank you Leo for bringing us all along on this magnificent journey.
I don't sail or have ever spent much time around boats, however I stumbled upon Leo's videos over 4.5 years ago and to this day I'm amazed at the fine craftmanship skills of each and every talented member of the team that ever worked on on Tally Ho. The sheer magnitude of taking on a project like this is life changing. Leo is a skilled boat builder, sailor, story teller, and now, director of some of the funniest ad's I have ever seen. One of my favorite videos is -Milling Live Oak in the Deep South - Rebuilding Tally Ho EP19, with Steve Cross. Steve is as authentic as they come.
I like the realistic portrayal of Dwarven women with a beard, real attention to detail.
Really fascinating video - used to be a project manager in development assistance so yes, one of the invisible people that make something whole in the end. Hang in there Leo it’s not always glamorous but it’s essential
Looking forward to the spar and rigging episode, cause I like spruce to.
Sprayed coffee all over my monitor laughing at the Wheels On The Bus bit.
I enjoyed this video very much!!  It really is starting to look like it’s only 2 years away now!! 😂😂❤
Is the Blue Moose Cafe still there?
Great presentation and workmanship on this beautiful project.
great video thank-you
Really interesting, and neat to see how much fun you all have with each other.  Looking forward to the full videos you teased on spars, rigging, etc.
Funny how I look forward eagerly to Leo’s latest Saturday-posted videos, almost like I was doing with TOHouse over 40-years ago.
A simply wonderful video that has captured the complexity, planning, and teamwork, (that has been repeatedly shown video after video), of just how hard an estimated 2 year, (ha, ha!),  restoring/building boat project is. My favorite way to spend a Saturday morning. Many, many thanks to you, Leo, and to each and every member of your crew throughout the whole process.
Isn't it funny how management duties feel like they take 75% of your time yet aren't valued by most people.  Some going so far as to say it's not really work at all.  It seems to be the same with everyone who works with their hands.  Paperwork, scheduling, work allocation, purchasing and other decision making being exhausting while actual manual labor feels like recreation.
Any video from Sampson Boat Co is amazing
Good stuff Leo.  I always learn something new and look forward to seeing you and the team.
Great look at the project!  I have to say I’m in awe of Clifton and the other gentleman making the companionways and hatches etc.  Just stellar work.  And the others are also great craftsmen and interesting characters.  Paddy is right about Tuesday😂.  Tuesdays have no redeeming value.
Great job
Made me laugh. Thanx, Leo.
I always look forward to your videos. Beautiful craftsmanship and attention to detail is phenomenal. Watching is very educational and I thoroughly love seeing the process.
Did  you say, "when the stove gimbles?" Does that mean it's self leveling?
Shout out for KEXP played on the stereo on Leo's truck.  It is a treasure well beyond music! Thanks Leo and crew.  We are watching a legacy in the making!!
I wish I had only found out about this channel today, so I could binge watch it all again :)
I love your videos. So much talent AND you guys are hilarious.
Great video.  Great craftsmanship.  Great camaraderie!  Really enjoyed this overview.
I’m starting to look forward to the sponsored ads.
I like different. Stay safe and we'll see you next week.
It had become too commersial
I bust a gut laughing about the meeting!  You and your team are the greatest because you do not take life too seriously!
Leo, your filming and editing are just so perfect. My personal favorite from this video were the inner thoughts of the guys during the meeting, especially Patty and The wheels on the Bus song. Absolutely hilarious.
leo you have mastered the skills required for all the best Project Managers! my career includes being a Project Manager - senior Project Manager  vice President /project management for several large Architectural and Engineering Firms in the Cleveland Ohio Area for over 30 years now! so I do believe ive some experience to assure my complement is supported by experience!  YOU ARE ONE AMAZING PROJECT MANAGER!
I love this channel!😂
Beautiful overview of the project processes and helps us all understand the complexity. Are you still using the project planning SW tools you were once using or reality got in the way. Some real craftspeople.
Love watching your channel, can tell your worried about the spars
17:20 Both "Me and Nick" and "Nick and me" are wrong. The correct way to say it is "Nick and I".
Awesome teams. Past and present. What wonderful people associated with Tally Ho. Her future is sound. Leo ... Will Pancho ever visit again ? We miss her.
fantastique travail de menuiserie ultra fine sius une direction exeptionnelle
This video actually did answer a lot of questions I have had over the past several months.  Rock on.
I've been modestly supporting Leo from the beginning. I remember the despair or dismay on his face as he was pulling apart the hulk and I remember thinking to myself, "he needs support." Glad I did. Now it's a big grown-up project and a testimony of perseverance and craftsmanship.
office work, for me it pays better, but catch me outside, how about that?
Seeing the coordination of energy and effort is terriffic. It takes a real master to keep so many people all working in close proximity and often overlapping space working so efficiently and effectively. This is a great building crew and hopefully all will be able to be on board for her maiden voyage. Tally Ho
You are getting better and  better at shooting ads!  :) "We need a Frodo... "  "Yeah I wonder who that'S gonna be" cracked me up really hard  :D
Very cool video!  Updates on this project are great.  Love your ads.  I usually FF through them on other videos, but not yours.  I really hope that sparring funding comes through.
I really liked this video! It was nice to get an overall update.
Thanks Leo. It will be amazing!
Another brilliant video. Thanks to you all.
I hate ads. Like with a passion. But I watch every second of these ads with a smile on my face. There is a difference between a 'content creator' and an artist...
the only series on youtube that gets better when they introduce ads.
"The wheels on the bus go round and round, " Hahahahahaha  😁
Thank you to all! ✨🌸✨
Such beautiful work
Comment 2: Holy Joinery Batman!
Really enjoyed that "overall look / behind the scene" format! Also, Nic as Frodo was spot on lol
Great to know your assistants are paid! They deserve it for all their beautiful work! It's evident they don't look at it as just a job, but a labor of love!
No more than a passing interest in the personalities. Any chance of more coverage of the processes?
I see my uncle's shop, right as Leo enters the boatyard, at 44 seconds, the gray building with the crane parked adjacent. Super cool! Shout out to Peter's Marine, the best aluminum and stainless steel fabricator you'll ever find. Love ya Uncle Pete!  Leo, keep up the amazing work. We've been following Tally Ho from the beginning, and splash time is rapidly approaching. It's amazing to see a project like this actually reach the finish line (soon). The finish line, it's well within sight. We're so happy that the project has not fallen flat like so many others. We believe in you, in all of the wonderful people who have contributed to the success of the project, and most importantly, we believe in Tally Ho. Keep on pushin'. Splash day is rapidly approaching, I know you can do it!  Cheers to all who have contributed, you're all truly amazing individuals. Cheers!  And, if I may add, your sponsor plugs are brilliant. We totally understand the need for sponsorship for the project (and channel), and absolutely love the way you and the team present your sponsor. I have yet to skip over your "ads", as they're just too dang entertaining. Well done lads.
Goodness; That is a lot of cash flow. There must be a full time accountant, also in the background.
Очень крутой канал!
Great video. One of the best.
I spit out my drink at the Patrick shot.
Not to worry, Leo. You haven't made a boring video yet, and I don't think that it is possible :)
So Leo, you are an experienced boat builder paying others to do boat work while you do admin.  Sounds to me like you need to pay someone part time to do some admin.  Love the boat
And you would do all this work by your self 😂😂😂 in the beginnings.
I cast my vote for interesting.
Very interesting - as always! And the craftmanship being displayed is simply stunning!
Great video.  Lots of interesting stuff. Top quality work. Crew looks like the get along really well. Been supporting Leo for years along with many others, but wow, the payroll and cost will push this project into the millions.
Outstanding Craftsmanship with a touch of Benny Hill
Great episode! You got a lot of irons in the fire!
One of the best videos yet. Loved the meeting, not so much cleaning the coffee up that I managed to spit out. I must say that yours are the only adverts I watch all the way through, the acting is oscar worthy (that would be Oscar from Sesame Street 🤣)  Keep it up you guys and gals, looks like you have a blast through the hard work, BZ.
Interesting to see the progress being made by each of the craftsman.
Another great video! Impressive craftsmanship and project management!
This is just such a fascinating world filled with truly dedicated, talented and hardworking craftspeople. Keeping the traditional skills alive and passing them on.
Great work, can you show us more detail on how to make traditional draws, ie how do they slide and lock so they don’t fall out?
Keep up the fantastic work!
Thanks Leo. this videop was unusual and really fantastic. It really shows how you and the team are working. For me, simple viewer that's great. Many thanks !
All your videos are interesting and I look forward to them every week.
all very interesting... project manager ... i.e. 'boss' ... (but eventually 'sole owner)?' ... just as should be
your interior layout makes a lot more sense than Arabella.  Giant work bench, two stoves and a fridge that blocks half the sink
Funnny ! A smiling G’Day to the crew. The galley layout like all the work and design on Tally is excellent.
I just watch for the ads at this point lol
Loved the video. Just a shame it takes so long to make, taking you away from what you love doing the most.
Thank you, Leo, for the happiness to the heart.   Great laughter and fun for all of you.
Side note:  I've used Blue Nile many times.   Never disappointed.
It's so true that as you add workers to any project that project management will become the most important function on the project. It's like the rudder on the project ship.. For a well oiled smooth running project every part of the project needs to be considered in it's detail and planning and ways around potential problems as well as making sure that each worker has what they need in advance to keep them working efficiently.  The devil is in the details. For want of a nail a horseshoe was lost etc...
Great stuff! I think we all knew everyone was busy, but to actually see it in a BTS fashion really confirms it. Lovely work and amazing talent!
In your spare time see about getting yourself cloned. Thanks for posting.
Good one
"Office work."   To the "boat builder and a sailor," you should now include, bookkeeper, project manager, payroll clerk, purchasing agent, camera operator and video editor.    It sucks that you have gotten away from the woodworking and ship building, but it's the only way a project that size can get done.
The craftsmanship and knowledge is something to behold. Thanks great viewing.
I was astounded to learn your editing ratio is 60 to 1. How much of that is integrating music and sound effects? I figured my 20 to 1 ratio was too much and could be cut by one-third if I weren't such a perfectionist, but I don't do music and don't deal with huge projects or other people.
It was so nice to see the people behind the work and their own stories.
good advertising material from the tally ho team,the amount of work that goes into the making of tally ho is incredible ,i never knew that there was so much detail,and craftmanship involved ,thank you all for making me understand and smile, i like everyones sense of humour ,your all working hard,take care ,it looks like over here in the uk mask wearing time very soon due to a new variant covid, be careful
LOVED the format, please do more. Congrats on the progress, and looking forward to more. Cheers,
Leo: NEVER boring mate! Spectacular work. 🇨🇦
"Includes paid sponsorship" usually brings about a feeling of quiet resignation in me - but then there's you lot! 😀 Don't stop seeking sponsorship!
I really like this format. I understand the need for dedicated videos but I think those should be the exception rather than the norm
Aloha Leo …. The wish list is EMPTY today ..
I love you gents...that's all.
This episode made me realize how much fun a Netflix show would be.
A shame how the brass knees have lost their polish already.   Hopefully a quick polish will bring them back to glory.
i love all your creations of the adds. and I will watch all of them. probably not buy some stuff because I happy with the things I have. but man the fun you have making the adds transfers directly through the screen into my and my heart.  And the way you show your gratitude hit me hard. different from the "regular" outro. I wish you Leo, the whole team, all people on the payroll and everyone whatching or reading the best life possible.   Enjoy your day. and Thanks for beeing you.
Very, very interessant. Nice People. Great craftsman
Excellent illustration of the incredible detail and complexity of the project at this point.  When you think back on the many things already done this shows how much talent is needed to get it right.  Way to go team.
You all make an amazing team.  What a great working atmosphere you have got there.  Congratulations.
lol these adverts are hilarious
Loving that gutter! Great video Leo, very informative!
keep up the good work Leo been watching you folk since the beginning of it all. looking great.
Very interesting video. Thank you.
Y'know my wife and I looked at buying Tally Ho many years ago when she was still in the water in the harbor at Chetco River, I think. I've followed this project from the beginning and I'm glad you took this on instead of me, Leo. Keep on keepin' on...best commercials on the internet, by the way.
Excellent vid...
i imagine this fine ship sailing off through the Strait of Juan de Fuca to points unknown with a happy crew aboard
You and your crew are my absolute favorite on youtube in the way you present commercials for supporting product companies. Everyone else seems to be serious about it and quite willing to blow smoke at it's loyal viewers in order to get the support. Love it!
Thanks for the overview, sooooo interesting to see all aspects of the work
LOVE the process, been watching it every week and can't wait for your next video! quick question, will you be insulating the inside of the hull to prevent condensation?
You bought the boat for one dollar, most expensive dollar you’ve ever spent😊
Great episode as always, illuminating to see just how much work is going on day-to-day!  Makes me die a little inside to think how many people won't understand the dial-up modem reference though 😅
Great match of sounds to personnel!
Here is a whimsical question😊….Have you given some consideration to having made a ships figurehead with some nautical significance? Probably over the top but hey it would be an eye catcher and a good story to tell fellow shipmates ☺️ cheers 🇨🇦✅
Sometimes it seems like Patrick is riding the short bus.😊
Such a great video so well done ty
So you know, I found the video very interesting. TY for sharing!
I wonder what Pete's doing...
Lmao loved the sponcer blue Nile
You have been blessed with a seemingly endless supply of incredible craftsmen and women to rebuild this boat, however if you keep making these in video commercials they may become divaesk...lol. The boat is beautiful.
Blue Nile should be selling pendants and earrings of Tally Ho to hang on a necklace, bracelet or ear.
The Sampson Boat Ad Agency hits a home run with another great ad.
Good to see you guys haven't lost your sense of humor.......the Blue Nile segment was priceless....... cheer's to you too ....
I really liked this format of video. The story is more fluid, and I can understand the progress of the boat better. Well done Leo!
15:40 I would be vain too with those locks ;P
I have loved watching the progress on this boat but still I wonder.  If you rebuild something from the bottom to the top replacing almost every piece, is it a new boat or an old boat?
I'm loving that dovetail joinery. 😍
WOW, what a complicated, high end, project...
Great stuff as always. One thing I would say is that sink will destroy all your crockery and cups over time. I had a butler sink for years and it was great but cost me a fortune in chipped cups and plates.
I love the commercials
Such a great team and amazing community all working hard towards what will be a truly special Yacht.  Everything looks first class and she will look incredible when she sets sail for the first time.  Andy UK
love it! 👍👍👍
My father and I always enjoyed watching videos and looking forward to completion. My father passed away last August. I really wished he was still around to see the completion.
Agreed. Tuesday is the worst. Mondays, you have the weekend on the brain. Tuesday, you have Mondays on the brain, and you're not even halfway through the week.
As the saying goes in Switzerland... If you're on time, you're already late!
Does anyone know when the next video comes out ? 😂😂😂
Just awesome what you and your team are doing!
I've got to see the bloopers from that Blue Nile commercial that would be hilarious... 🤣
Cheesy commercials 😅 don't give up your day job 😅
Great commercial. When are you going to start making build videos again. Ever? Two weeks to watch a commoercial, That is so modern.
I have been watching you from the very start it is a credit to you from a piece of junk sure beautifully restored vintage yacht
Love the adverts
Hahahahaha! What goes through people's minds at morning meetings.
Talk to the engine mfr about possibly having a hand operated pre-lube pump to be used when the engine stays idle for a long time and the bearings are relatively dry. Just a thought, you are doing a super job!
It works because of Nics hair. Nice.
Unsure if I like the content or ads better
Usually, I always watch videos at double speed to be as efficient as possible. Leo's videos are the only ones I watch at regular speed. I enjoy them. They are informative, relaxing, and funny. Leo is a very likable guy, as well as his crew. And I say that as an Alpine resident who has nothing to do with boats.I also usually watch with an ad blocker to avoid the pressure of ads. But Leo has managed to make me look forward to the ads.
Dialup still going strong!
who is working on the front door installation?
Good video
I´ve been watching you guys for years... and lately the wood working is getting stale... Lately, I only watch for the commercials.
LOL the sound effects nailed it.
Lookin good Smeagol! Edit: man i wish i was able to help fund this project. Barely getting by as it is 😅. Hope all goes well for you regarding the spars
Having lived in PT off and on it was a bit nostalgic. Love the bright work completed and the morning meeting was truly inspiring. Joiner work is also impressive. Have a great day Leo and gang.😊
Amazing job to all of you, thank you so much for bringing this to the world.
Awesome commercial-- well done...
😎
Best laugh of the day. Cheers Leo from Shropshire UK.
Nuts almost 8000 views in 20 minutes. Crazy!! Love it. All the video that you make is always interesting.
How many love the adds on these hilarious
There is so much craftsmanship and expensive material going into the boat that it’s beyond comprehension
I hope your advertisers know that we all fast-forward to find your endorsement enactments!
I am sharing this video just based upon ad.
I immediately thought of these lines of a song from my childhood...  Woke up, fell out of bed Dragged a comb across my head Found my way downstairs and drank a cup And looking up, I noticed I was late Found my coat and grabbed my hat Made the bus in seconds flat Found my way upstairs and had a smoke And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
ROFLMAO Again! Way to go guys - your commercials are become a major feature ! LOL 👍
😁😂😊
Just a beautiful "restoration" of Tally Ho. I am so looking forward to the final finished yacht 🙂
The crew beat regular advertisements every time…do you have problems with rabbits running riot?the quality of work is beautiful to seein this very informative video,cheers Roly🇬🇧.
Five minutes early is ten minutes late.
Its more Like the old Videos i Like it 👍😉
Yessss
Get moving guys we need the boat out on the oceans.what are we wa😢for?
Always look forward to these om my weekend :))
I hope you don't make the crew do silly, new age, pre-work warm up exercises in the morning.  Bligh was a new age thinker, he tried pre-work exercises for his crew and that's why he got chucked off the Bounty.
Write your list the night before, you will sleep better.
The wheels on the bus go ... i lost it, brilliant .. 😂😂😂
Best ad sketch yet
Hey Leo, I really like that fridge. Do you mind telling the make and model?
get a toroidal propeller
The wheels on the bus go round and round😂😂😂
The dialup sound caught me completely off guard and I burst out laughing!
Some amazing craftsmen , doing amazing work ..
