Hii!!
>.> I watch BM because I have anxiety and every time it's acting up he just makes me feel like the most chill person ever in life! lol PS: you did a great job given the circumstances. I've been there.
You two are so adorable, like, cuter than kittens, cuter than Keanu Reeves with a lap full of puppies, crazy level of adorableness x
Ok I’m so glad I found this. I know it was months ago but I’m laughing so hard. I love you guys. You both make me laugh so hard. Thank you both.

Best collab ever!
I have that same dog brush for my dog 🤦🏻‍♀️
Me and Joey have the same issue with how fast our hair grows
My dreams came true today to see both of these men in one video!!
Joey I need interior design help! Have you made a video of interior design tips? We just got our first house and I have no idea how to decorate!
they would be so cute together..
A combo video with both Joey and Brad? Fantastic!
"Never before had I needed something so badly and not know until I received it."

Please pick me for makeover even though I am 9 years old I have not been picked a winner for a contest over something like that so please pick me maybe after Corvette 19
Brad stressed out from watching Joey 🤣
The back of Joey’s head: Am I a joke to you??
Of course it’s good, Hayley Williams doesn’t mess around:)
Wow good go Joey
Yes dye it another color ✨ I thought you were going to color it for some reason at the end ... it’s def a must ✨🤩✨
My two favourite bois 🍓
When they try the different brand I was like oh OK this could turn out good, then I saw he bleached his whole entire head again and I got nervous
Not Joey using Good Dye Young
Joey: LeTs UsE a DoG bRuSh  Brad: *dies inside*
So are we just going to ignore Bradley Mondue....because that killed me.
Joey do not do this
I used to watch brad mondo I kind of forgot dough
Does anyone know what toner did he use? Trying to go platinum blonde and I'm missing the toner
The fact that he used a dog comb
It I would rate this it would be..... ⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇           11 out of 10
Dog brush 🤣🤗
My two favourite Ytbers
whats the thing that you used?? i wanna dye my hair
I want him to buzz his hair shorter with the blonde I think it would look dope
I’ve been subscribing to you since I was little and now I’m eight years old
Hayley Williams has joined the chat
I imagined, " *NO DON'T START AT THE TOP* " as soon as I saw the title
Im shipping Brad and joey now😳
I love how Joey was failing to say sanitizer but it was wrong still!!!!!!!!
Joey: *starts*  Brad: *LITERARY DIES*  Joey: "That's good enough"
You missed the (AGAIN) thingy
Not gonna lie I kinda did this 🤭😅
Where did you get your shirt?
THE DOG BRUSH THO
If I ever dyed my hair I wouldn't want it to look natural, I want a unique color 🤣
I love it Joey!!!!! 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😙😙😙😙😙😙😙
omg why was i scared and worried watching this
what's the name of the toner he used
Brad and Joey would be a good couple 😏
His hair grew back so fast tho-
Joey : If you mess this up your gonna lose your job that’s all  (Don’t remember his name) Yeah yeah that’s all heh 0-0’’
Did anyone else realize he wrote Bradley Mondue?
Brad: I don’t want you to look ugly  Joey: then will go back to Sally’s and try it again Brad disappointment
Omg bradmondo look so much like damon from vampire diaries
•
brad having a panic attack for 17 minutes
Who else would pay to have brad mondo walk them through dying their hair on a zoom call?👆😙
I’m blaming u
S U C K
You could see Brad Mondo's face gradually getting more red...
If they were straight they would be so handsome
put the furminator down
When he turned his head I DIEDDDD!!!😭😭😭
I knew you reminded me of someone and I couldn't figure out who it was...
My mom bleaches her hair WITH THE DOOR WIDE OPEN so when he made the face when he smelled it i felt the pain
this video had me on edge the entire time but it was so worth it
Imagine them dating...
I ship you guys
Maybe a little bit of blue

My favorite part was when joey stopped what he was doing and just stared when Oscar..? Said that would be the color of his hair.
Joey: doing his hair with dog comb  Me:bobbing to the wii music

Dog brush perfection XD

Joey .. I should yues the hotel bottle
Did I hear babe?
:))))))))
I used to dye my hair a lot. I figured out I used it as a coping mechanism when I was depressed on unsatisfied with my life.
Best video idea ever!!
I have always want to say: tysm for all the likes, BUT                       I DONT GET ANY T^T
I liked you in the purple!
I think u should maybe dye your beard the same colour idk lol
I do not like it.      It love it!!!!!!!!!!
i didnt know i needed this until i saw he uploaded this
Joey you are a good dog
joey looks like that one character from episode
Imagine brad beeing on escape the night, staying sarcastically calm the whole night and beeing more freaked out by overly bleached hair then beeing murdered 😂
Brad Mondo reacting to Joey Graceffa bleaching his hair with products from Hayley Williams' hair dye company... OMG I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I NEEDED THIS 🧡
I never knew I needed this
So cute I love this friendship 🥰
That tie dye with the hair tho 👌
The hair cut <3

I LOVE this collab!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Heheh I am laughing so hard heh
Ilysm ❤❤❤❤
I just bleached my hair too! WE BOTH LOOKIN LIKE GUY FIERY
If you were going to dye it a colour I think you should go blue!
Omg as a hairstylist I’m literally cringing watching this 😂😂 I feel you Brad!!
I am living for blonde Joey!!
The 2 most beautiful men on YouTube 😍
Anyone else getting fluffy chick vibes from joey before the toner? 🐥😂  Great finished look tho!
Oscar : theres one spot but its behind your ear IF ANYONE CAN SEE IT THERE TOO CLOSE
Everyone (including brad): “WHY ARE YOU USEING A DOG BRUSH”                *DOg bRUsH HaS LEft tHe cHat*         17:03 *cRAckHeAD COnTEnT*

I watched this last night (I live in Europe) and was kinda shocked with the result. I've watched it again a couple times today and I'm 100% here for all the "crackhead content". So many great moments, it's like a MV that deserves decoding! I could watch this on repeat. We need a photoshoot now! Luv u ❤️
well i guess i’m lucky cause i am a natural platinum blonde
Hi

Nooooo doesn’t look good Joey. Definitely no blonde. Stay dark or rock your colors. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
I see your 'I literally don't know with my hair' phase joey
“Bananas in there“ I’m dying
When you grow your hair out a little you need to make it into a mullet like Miley's one now
How do you feel about deep conditionings
THE DOG HAIR BRUSH
you may dye your hair brown or lets try a dark black colour and that would be soooo awefully amazing :)
JOEY, YOU LOOK AWESOME IN THIS WEIRD STYLE ...

Your friend/camera guy was completely worthless. You need eyes to do the back of your head and he did nothing hardly.
Hi joeeyyyy it's  my first time being this early,  i mean not that early but I just wanna say your videos make me so happy 🥺🥺
Oh Joey you look fine. So fine. (I sweat for what I can never have. In so many ways I can never, ever... ever...)

Your hair grow so fast
Moral of the story: Joey didn’t like chemistry class

Omg I clicked on this video and I said... OMG joey here we go again!    With the hair
Who edits Joey's videos? I really like the editing job on this video. I don't think video editors get enough cred. Fantastic job.
Your hair kinda reminds me of gerard way's hair in 2006 xD It really suits you, no joke🖤🦇  I really wanna try this now as well but I'm kinda terrified xD
No boiiiiiiiiiii we need the brown back ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
No boiiiiiiiiiii we need the brown back ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
