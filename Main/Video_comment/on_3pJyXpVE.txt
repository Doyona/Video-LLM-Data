BRAVOOOOOH..!!!   GREAT  JOOOB  WELL-DONE,,,!!!  USA  USA  USA  USA  USA..!!!!😇😇
L Jamaica
“here we go” gives me insane energy bro this commentator is amazing
The fact that Noah wasnt on the team tho smh -Ima be on it 😂 but you still my boy tho
And then disaster one year later.... >:o
Lyles should have done the duck forward  at the end
Italy cooked! Idc! Every single leg & handoff was smooth! 2nd & Anchor leggggg! 🔥
Chicken leg on a stick did the trick
Those are my boys. USA USA USA
3:58 Race begins.
Noah told his teammate (3rd leg) “no more my bad” 6:01. That’s leadership quality.
Teeth don't have to say 3; stay humble 🙏
Teeth don't have to say 3; stay humble 🙏
LOOK AT THE CHINA GUY FACE IN HAIR THEY ARE TRYING TO HARD , HAIR JUST FLYING HAHA,
They done dropped the baton so much it don't matter how they pass it...they got it done
Omg Kerley 😋
Set signs at the Olympics is epic 😂😂😂
NOAH!
Way to go Italy!
I do not agree with Ato - by FAR the worse handoff was Coleman to Kerly - Kerly is HORRIBLE in basic relay protocol - He took of WITHOUT a sense of urgency - Literally jogging out - That is why Coleman ran past him after the exchange - Kerly would JOG out again in that disastrous Olympic 4x1 - costing the US a Medal - even though Bednarik blew it in the first exchange by taking off way to early - Kerly is shamefully horrible on relays - you could go with your 5th guy, and have a MUCH better leg because the exchanges on both ends will be better
I love track and I do track
That white boy was moving!
Every time I see this race I smile for the USA team
Noah and the other 3 young men are nothing but the best, i love my team USA, you got this young men, do proud of all of you, awesome, awesome.
If only they knew
Black Americans 💪🏾
And then, the Olympics happened.
Not Bona-fide Olympics. Wasted money spent by Genocidal Countries while starving people in Gaza's Genocide and Russia where  some of the best athletes live is not allowed to compete. Not Bona-fide. Stolen Medals.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😎
Who’s here after Olympic men 4x100? I don’t know how they did so terrible at Olympic. They did so good in this race on last year. 😂
So how they say Noah have Covid 😷 so why is running in the relay ..because he came third in the 200m they say him have Covid 🙄
Good run
WOW!!! 🥇🫵🏽🇺🇸
Go USA Go
🤌🏼 USA 4×4 BOOTS ON THE GROUND, THIS IS HOW LEGION'S ARE MADE 🇺🇸🌎💫🙏🏼✨
Italian guy caught up he was 4th pretty fast!
Tortu and Jacobs of Italy can both get it 😂
Wooohoooo bravo USA❤🇺🇸❤️❗️
God Bless our. U S A team thank all so proud of all
Jamaica  the drug used after doing nothing as a runner or team ever be detected
U S A
I handed off better when I was in junior high 😂
the baton pass must not be practiced enough...  great win by the americans .
Italy alittle zesty lol
I started follow your carrer and you are amazing
Brandon carnes, you are NOT making that 4x1 Paris team 😭😭🤣
Torque
Congratulations guys!👏👏👏🙏🏻🙌
Closing the deal with the finisher!!!!
This same team need sto run now in Paris at the Olympics
👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
This guy has no, class! Sorry but you won't hear to much more about this show boat , !
What Lyles is doing is insane!  Shout out to the 4th Italian dude as well!
i am more shocked at Italy n 2nd place.. nice
USA...🥰🎉🎖🎖🎖CONGRATULATIONS!!!
Goddam Lyles is fast. Best kick of this Olympics. No one is close.
Being as competitive as these guys all are, I wonder if it ever bothers them that no matter if they win gold or not, that they still will never be as fast as Usain Bolt...
I love Fred! So low key and humble. Always rooting for him also laughing at “ you know how track and field works” !!!!
Its funny to see how happy Italy is over second place but the US would have been so pissed if it was us. We dont do second place 😂  Hate so much about this country but proud American during the Olympics!
They fly!!!🎉❤❤❤❤ Go team USA ❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 🎉🎉🎉🙌🙌
that 2nd and 3rd for USA needs to go.. sorry.. Lyles did that.
did you doubt it?
USA all the way
Congratulations 🇺🇸❤️✨🌟⚡🎉
CONGRATULATIONS USA.
Noah will win in Paris France The Gold Medal 🥇. Go Nooooaaahhhh....
Noah Lyles can I braid your hair ?
❤❤❤❤❤😊
Afterburners on 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
💯💯!!
This is the Olympics, not the world championships
Lyles is incredible.
USA ❤️❤️❤️
6:01 bro wtf why they fuckin on camera
Proud he’s an American! 🇺🇸
USA 🔥💪🏾🔥💪🏾🔥
I loved the Jamaica days
IS THIS 2024 OLYMPICS SHACARI& LYLES USA WINNING GOLD?
USA FOUND THEIR SMILE.....SHEER TALENT ❤💯🙌🙌👊🤟🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
USA ❤🎉🇺🇸♥️😍
Noah is a beast, he is cocky but he backups his cockiness!
Thats them SUPER BEINGS get'n  it DONE. ❤❤❤❤ CONGRATS BROS❣️ Go Team USA.
Whoooooa🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
CONGRATULATIONS 😂🎉❤
FBA!
Getting ready for the Olympics which is here right now!!!! Screammmmm!!!!! I'm so nervous for the US. So many great teams but our lineups are stellar.
Great athletes
What’s the names of the Japanese team
Im a be on it! 😂
Noah’s acceleration as soon as he knew he had a hold of the baton 🔥 6:53 crazy
Amazing and awesome, the time would have been far lower if the baton technique was better. Gold standard regardless
Japan 4th leg was flying
Very impressed with Japan's 4th leg!!!!! If that handoff was better I'm sure he would've not only caught but beat Jamaica
Congratulations Great Job Men ❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍👍👍
The Baton passes were suspect because they have the receiving runner in the starter's position.  That directly causes confusion and light-headness.  Period,
Did Italy win? Come on Italy - yall acting like won something !!!! Stop it
🖤✊🏾
So exciting. Go baby go!
Great run guys
Not Italy beating Jamaica and homie was fast too
Thank you for another great video.
Japan has come a long ways also but Italy stepped up big time and surprised Jamaica is falling off.  USA reigns supreme always!
Man that anchor for Italy was MOVING. whew.
Congrats USA, Italy had burners
This is so refreshing! Go USA!
Great job 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
jamaican guy didn't have a good day on that last leg. not only did he get blown up by the italian guy, japan almost caught him.
wow the US looks crazy strong
That was a win for italy too tbh the smoked jamacoa thats a accomplishment
Japan and Italy 1st baton pass was flawless💯
I said this once before when I was younger. White men can literally come in second and people are impressed. When I was in school and I got a 96 on a test and they got a 85.. it was like their 85 was a 102 and they were star of the class. lol it’s incredible.
Congratulations B.Carnes fellow Manatee High Allumni
Why do they even use a BATON in relays? They should just Tag the next persons hand within the Exchange Zone. This would make it so much smoother and no team gets DQ'd. Also, why do the even have a gunman for the races. They should just start with set, and have a rhythmical 3, 2, 1, count down after SET, then a gun sound.... Plot holes in Track...
Yssss go men 🏃 ❤it❤❤❤😂🎉😢😢😢😂❤
can anybody see this
USA Always Coming For Blood. No Cap
Another great race!
Does Noah Lyles remind anyone else of Usain Bolt? He has that acceleration that I’ve only seen in one other person. It’s insane!!
Living in the USA, you would understand why US will always win the most Gold medals in the Olympics.  The talent pool is limitless. No Country is ever beating the US.
*_Explosive!_*
Noah is *_explosive!_*
U.    S.    A.      #9 Baby!!!
That dude that ran anchor for Italy was scootin
WR would be destroyed if they can get Erriyon Knighton on the 3rd leg running that curve!
HOLY!! USA just ran 37.40 at Bahamas without even having the perfect line up and it’s early in the season! USA is going to go sub 37 at Paris 100%
Way to go USA! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Noah Lyles has freakishly, blistering 🔥speed!!🇺🇸I can’t believe how he accelerates the way he does!! He is incredible!🇺🇸
Nobody!!!
Go, Noah.
🇺🇸🎉
If it’s not Coleman to fred to knighton to lyles in Paris we got problems😂
I CANNOT WAIT FOR PARIS 2024!!!!!!💃🕺🏼💃🕺🏼💃🕺🏼❤️💃🕺🏼❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
2nd leg to 3rd leg for Jamaica had a bad exchange 😭
JAMAICA GOT WHIPPED BY ITALY!! WOW...
GO USA!
Lyles was like "you think You've got a shot? No chance"
🎉🎉🎉
I love it when they pump them up. Then, when they lose crickets
Liles are tha best
What's crazy is they could have ran faster if the handoff was better!!
Watching with my 5 year old son … he want to race for the USA! Great job guys!! Amazing ❤
I bet that Italian thought he could run down Noah lyles like he did the year they one gold but nope lyles top end speed is unmatched
Italy practices on their hand off, and they were perfect.
Americans are just different.
Fred fine as wine❤
Italy's Tortu (last leg) he was flying. He beat GB and Jamaica. That was amazing. Give credit where credit is due, no one was catching Lyles. He should always anchor the 4x100 relay.  The last leg was is exciting to watch.
These are Americans or African American OH I'm sorry you're competing for the USA so now you're American WOW
The original motherland Amerika, the indigenous American men also the most dominant tribe
USA🎉🎉🎉🎉
Love the man making running like 👍 we can do this with. A Big Smile.😊❤.
Its crazy how hard they were celebrating 2nd place. I guess they didnt expect to be in that position either
I KNOW Italy is fuming. That handshake by Tortu to Noah Lyle’s as soon as he finishes was a “good luck in Paris kiddo, we’ll see you then”
Let’s go yall yes yes yes congratulations
How much money these runners make..?
Italy's handoffs were too smooth. Their anchor leg ate.
watching this you would think Italy just won the entire world record history of the world lol
THESE DUDES ARE ON 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏  CAN' TOUCH THEM💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
If you give Noah even a inch your done!!!!!
As per usual the US men had to rely on their sheer speed to overcome sub par baton passes. The first pass was the best.   At least they didn’t drop it.
Crazy stuff 😮
The Goat
This dud has gas.speed.i meen fast.U.S.A.styl see ya .😮😊🎉
Lyles is amazing!!!!!
It is no way this USA team could of lost have in all 3 of the last 100 meter world champions on this relay
I love that the Italian team is always celebrating a medal, even if it isnt gold
If it wasn't Noah on anchor, Italy would have won just as they did at the Olympics in Tokyo.
oh my those passes are shaky.. LOL need to fix for the olympics
Nippon was running good too!
USA and Jamaica!
*IN CASE THERE WAS ANY DOUBT USA* 🇺🇸 😊
Im so happy for ITALY GOT SILVER!!! GREAT JOB!!!!
Philipe turtle is the future of Italy anchor leg my man acceleration is too clean
I love Noah Lyles. He is going to make some pretty babies. So hot!!!
Italy wouldn’t beat this team if they were on the team at the last Olympics. Italy won’t be winning anymore. This race wasn’t even close. Haha 😆
Italy 3rd and 4th leg got them that silver. Wow impressive comeback
FENOMENAL 💃🏻🙏🏽💃🏻💪🏽
Noah built for this that's why hes fast
GO NOAH!!!
awesome race !!!, noah is OP at this moment
WOW cant believe Italy took silver beating Jamaica
USA #1
When dude comes in second he looks like he won the gold. Good for them. They must’ve over performed.
An excellent race to display the importance of handoffs. USA and Italy did a great job, but I was most surprised by Japan. They may have taken 3rd if not for that last handoff.
🇺🇸🥇🥇🥇🥇👈🏿😌👌🏿👍🏿
Filippo Tortu is the most underrated anchor in 20 years.
Why do all those commentators, men and women, sound a like😅
The “DREAM TEAM” would be if Trayvon Bromel was on 3rd leg …….THATS THE WORLD RECORD TRUST 🤞🏾👌🏽
YOOOO ITALY WAS MOVINGGGGGG
I wonder who we could put as the third leg to break the record... Travon Bromell.. or Bracy??
Future
Why is no one talking about that Japanese anchor?! His closing was insane.
Congrats, Team USA!!!👏👏👏
If the US wasn't in this race, Italy would appear to be the dominate team. Italy's anchor put the hammer down!
RACE START 3:55 YOU'RE WELCOME
The African American men should be recognized as great American. But it should be mentioned more that these men represents the African American community as well as America! There is know reason why American fails to give African Americans reparations especially due to our contribution to America on so many levels .
LOL! Italy act like they won the championship. I take it they never got silver in this event....ever?
Yes Noah u did it and jamican set up was wrong the should have put serville to anchor he would have caught the Italian anchor i give him that and put the anchor on 2nd ,he was 4th in the finals
I don’t know what that spokesman was talking about but all three and I do mean three of United States passes were horrible. Can you imagine how many seconds are ticks they could’ve knocked off of their time they need to go back and practice hand offs hand offs and more handoffs they can run, but their handoffs are holding them back.
can you imagine how fast the U.S. team would be if they passed the baton like the Italians?
Noah Lyles a true World Champion!!! Not a fake one like  the NBA teams.😂
why dream team? did they break the record? 🤡
Let's thank God
Outstanding
Those baton passes were horrible... I'm amazed the time was so fast. Kerley literally had to stop.
Noalyas is cold
Go USA🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
That is as beautiful, but as a high school track coach, I would have liked a “ this is how you pass the baton” teaching video.  I’ve seen winning( at that level and junior college), lose because of bad passes
Italy not just won silver. Their last leg literally outran Jamaican
Lyles created huge separation between him and 2nd.
USA Always Coming For Blood!!! We Don't Play Around!!! 💪💪💪
Now they are World Champions!! His take aged well!
I would like to see Knighton make the 4x100 team too, but when their taking gold medals keep this squad going… the Italian cat who was anchoring was rapid!! He was 4th when he got the stick then dusted Jamaica and someone else to get silver. Respect
I love Noah lyes belief  I'm going to be on that relay team ❤ champions
Those three teams were expected to metal not much a surprise but glad usa won gold medal 🥇
Man that Italian team thou fast group especially the last anchor
Hopefully Michael Norman , Erriyon Knighton, Kenny B can run 3rd leg in Paris 2024! WR is gone even with decent passes
Great job men USA
You know what I love doing?  Watching sports clips where the title and/or description of the video tells me the outcome of the event!!  Yes, please give me more!!
🔥🔥🔥
Good job 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
😤😤😤😤😤😤 NOAH DESTROYED THEM BUT ITALY 🇮🇹 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 that anchor for Italy 👀 WATCH HIM
Please no body should misunderstand me, I love American when they win any race, my heart feels of joy anytime am watching their race I love it so much thanks you GUYS, GOD will make your generation shine and shine for good 👍 for ever thank you ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Phenomenal Team USA!
Congrats to Team USA.
World champ Noah got speed in his legs
Wow Italy 👌🏽
why do they start running and make their teammate try to catch up to them? Sometimes they are running too fast and their teammates be looking tired and they struggle to get it in their hands because they are moving their arms too much and not looking at the baton.
Jamaica's anchor was the slowest they've had in forever. He lost ground to everyone, barely held on for 3rd and was only one step behind Noah when he got the baton.
Japan would have finished 3rd except they lost a few meters on the last handoff. Watch the anchor in lane 9, he was 3 steps behind Jamaica and England when he got the baton but he closed and finished behind both of those teams by only a half a step.
Unlike our women's team, the men had 3 good baton handoffs that helped them win. The women won and set a championship record time despite having 2 not-so-good handoffs. How much better will the women's team be if they get the baton handoffs right.
Did I just watch Italy beat Jamaica 😮wow
Yeah 🍾
Yeah, well done, USA Track and Field. Now don't blow it in Paris next summer. 😐
Congrats to the men, Team USA 🇺🇸 😊🎉🎉❤🤍💙🥇🎶🎉🎉
Congats USA! But I'm like Italy beat Jamaica?..Dayum!
2 Samuel 2:18  Still as fast as deer....
Italy calm down😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Congrats....Lyles just out ran the anchors...
Wow finally the USA team they got the gold congratulations 👏👏👏👏🎉🎉🎉🎉.
The way lyles said I'ma be on it was not very team like, but shout out to them for winning
Starts at 4:01
True world champion 🏆
🐆
Now that's my team usa men's team getting it done
BlackMAN ! MAGIC.... WE ARE IMPORTANT..AND GIFTED❤❤❤... USA NEEDS TO RECOGNIZE...
Lyles his the beast for the 200m.
I've never been more hyped for the Olympics
Dude is a BEAST!!! Lyle is the G.O.A.T!!!
S/O to the Italians for getting silver.
Beautifully executed!! Congratulations 🎉❤😊
6:05 when cousins doing they thang and someones opens the door
Go team  USA ❤
That boi said suspect passes 😂😂😂😂😂
Football players use juggs machines to improve catching footballs. Shouldn't relay teams male and female make improving passing batons a greater priority? Clearly that has been the difference in records and wins.
Harken to the video title: Where is the "drag race"? Does Noah wear Shacarri's wig?
Noah gotta have respect for his team. Talking bout "umma be on it" when asked if this the Paris team. Be humble my guy
Coleman was MOVING!
Imagine if this team perfects their baton transitions... Unstopabble. Congrats USA
USA uniforms look clean AF
Someone help this brother and his divisive comments true or not what did he accomplish by saying those comments
Oh that’s the dude that said the nba championship is not a world championship. Tell me you ain’t never picked up a book in your life without telling me you ain’t never picked up a book in your life.  You must not know that what your compete in is also NOT a world championship since it mostly include G20 countries. Not all athletes on earth have the same access to the same resources you have my guy.  You never even knew that you’ve never participated in a true athletics competition neither. This along with the diamond league and even the Olympics is an economic might competition not an athletics competition.
Congratulations!
Magnificent
El segundo de Italia y el último 😮 rompieron también
Congratulations Noah and Team USA⭐️❤️🏆
Well well well
They got lucky with those shaky baton passes! Need to keep practicing.
Is team China biracial...just a question not a put down 😊
I get so tense while the race is in progress 😬  Then the release...gold 🏅
So nobody saw Lamont jacobs second leg?
Japan struggle on that last leg but the Italy guy was gone😊 Nice race guys..REPESCT 2 ALL WINNERS&RUNNERS...Noah was like forest gump he was keep running🎈🎉🎊😍😍💪🏿💪🏿
Bruh We Took It.  Buuuuut the ITALIANS finished second NOT Jamaica !! Dayuuuuummmnnnn
Beast Mode
The placement to the ad is insulting.
Noah was Trotting like a horse💨💨💨💨💨 TEAM 🇺🇸
Such respect for Lyles…He is all heart! 💯
Who really cares about track. There's no skill in it. All you do is run. In basketball, you have to do more than run. You have to focus, think, and react. The NBA is worldwide, not to mention it accumulates more money then running any day.
Man nobody wants to see the agony of defeat. Get off the track bruh!
USA. Lookin like JAM 😂
Japan had a bad baton exchange in the last leg...they could've wound up 3rd or even 2nd.
Hello sport fans....you know I can't for the LIFE of me understand why those handoffs where so amateurish  for the US team...even in junior high we had better handoffs then team USA....But I guess a win is a win...bye bye track & field lovers...
and still not half the talent a nba player has.
No doubt Lyles deserves the spotlight, but holy smokes did Italy SHOW UP.
WORLD CHAMPION! NOT LIKE  N.B.A. OR SO CALLED BASEBALL WORLD SERIES?
Noah shade is sooo shady… IMMA BE ON IT 😂😂😂
Great talent. But running for nations that show blacks no love? Odd.
I never in my life thought I'd see an Italian man outrun a Jamaican. Props!!
Watching Noah Lyles run is exhilarating. Congrats to him and the US team.
How Jamaica let Italy beat them...embarrassing hahaha.
🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯
"USA moves into the lead over Japan". I never thought I hear that in my lifetime.
Italy beat Jamacia? Wow
Why is the 4x100 video ten minutes long?
Pay Them more and. Endorsements
Holly Molly Lyes down shifted and took of like the uss enterprise " warp speed"
I love how Tortu was happy for 2nd as well.
USA ALL THE WAY!!!! Did anyone else notice Italy's handoffs?...... Perfect in every way.
That was a great race.
Dream team but we needed the anchor to pull away in order to win? 🤔🤔🤔
How the f is every Olympic team a dream team now? Are they the fastest 10 in the world? Then they aren’t a dream team. Just stop.
I was look 'ooh we got a race'... Then instantly was like 'oh... nevermind'... As he pulled away to finish the race... 😂😂😅😅... 🏃💨💨💨...
Trust me!!! NOBODY is writing a song about 37.3 😂😂😂. Lyles needs to be quiet!!! If you beat any of the world records then we can talk, until shhhh kid
So proud of my people 🇺🇸 ❤
YO Italy’s anchor was FLYING!! Super impressive too
Team USA!!!!😝❤👏👏
USA champion men relay team Gold Gold Gold Gold ❤
Noah needs to show some humility. Cockiness is not becoming.
Christian Coleman is amazing
PAUSE
Congratulations
Tht man took off
I can't believe Jamaica came in 3rd
Ato hit the nail on the head: those final two baton passes were nothing exemplary. Looking more closely, the final pass to Noah was so clumsy it could have been disastrously dropped!!
Notice Japan's handoffs compared to the US.  If we passed the baton as well as they did, the time would be much faster.
🇺🇸
Dream team? 36.84  🇯🇲
USA!!USA!! But shoutout  to Italy though. Them boys were gone💨💨💨💨
Horrifying handoffs! Somehow still a great finish!
Hahaha the baton passes. Nothing u want to show 😂😂 but a wins a win!
Italy was so happy to get silver.
You can screw up the baton pass if you’re the fastest team in the world😂
Yall see what Japan did lol, they’re finally figuring it out
Let’s gooooooo!!!! Team USA!!
6:41 bro why tf is this dude not handing him the baton? Literally holding it at his chest instead of passing with an outstretched arm
Congrats to team USA hardly ever in doubt considering the form the were in. But kudos to Tortu (Italy) who hold his own with the fastest man of the season and secured Silver for Italy almost the same way he did it with Gold at the Olympic in Tokyo.
U.S.A.!!!🗣️🗣️🗣️
Great job USA!!!
Wooh
Is it me or did Noah Lyles outrun the camera there? Lol
Those Italians are fast
Good job guys! So fun to watch
Whoever coaches these relay teams both Men and women should be fired. These relay records should have been broken but the baton passing/exchanges are terrible ... embarrassing!!!🙈
Jamaica was beat by Italy huh? It's time for Jamaica to have a team meeting 😅
Track and field events are the best
🫁🫀🏁
USA 🇺🇸😎  SN: It got overlooked but the anchor for Japan was cooking!!!! He closed that gap like nothing! 🫡 salute to him
another look the second leg of Italy was flying and caught up a lot.
Italy beat Jamaica??
Man, Coleman is a BEAST off the block.  Even those terrible handoffs only let the other teams almost catch up, and of course they aren't gonna catch Lyles even if he only had a half step head start.  I'd love to see the splits on that final, but even 3 days after the event I can't find them on the world athletics site.
NBC ruins every event by giving away the results in the title.
VA stand up🗣️🗣️
Congrats to Team U.S.A. !!! Congrats also to Team Italy, the "Four Ferraris" !!!
Noah and Sha’Carri need to have a baby. Usain and Shericka Jackson need to have a baby too. This will be a battle of fast twitch vs. long powerful muscles. Let the games begin!
NOAH IS BUILT DIFFERENT 🔥🔥🔥
Lyles just said, "Peace!" and never looked back. Italy has great runners this year.
He should’ve hopped on the 4x4 and got another gold
Italy acting like they won gold
🏅🏅🏅
God bless and good job men
Touche' 4×100 Gods🎉❤
Italy 2nd wth
Wow the gap he put between them amazing 🤩 💨
Bruh WC were insane USA went crazy great to watch these beast no cap lol stay safe RIP Harry Belafonte Bob Barker pray for our world BLM God bless checkout the band The Main Squeeze 🙏
Almost a second slower then the bolt Jamaica world record…..
Patta made up that gap in that 2nd curve
I am no longer a fan of Noah.
Italy gets Silver. They won the Gold at Tokyo Olympics. TorTu is an awesome anchor-leg.!!
The USA men is on 🔥 like the ladies
The US is nothing without us winning for them. We need our own representation outside of this country
This man Lyles is so much fun to watch. I’m a distance runner, I’ve always been into the distance races but Lyles has that Usain Bolt effect where he’s so good at his events that he attracts ALL track & field fans to watch his events.
carnes legs were MOVINGGGG
Luv that team USA won, awesome to watch. CONGRATS🎉🎊. ❤ confidence, charisma, celebrating wins and hardwork...but hope Lyles stays humble and focused.
Americans are just diffrent.
USA is THEE force to be reckoned with for almost everything track and field
World champion of what? The United States?!!!
Noah Lyles is insane!! His form is so perfect - long strides, head down, fast arms.  Burning the rubber off his shoes! Crazy! 😂❤👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
🇺🇸 USA
It’s amazing how fast as a human race we are becoming!! My Lord! We are becoming machines! Lol so fast!! These men were incredible, period!! 🏃‍♂️💨
Great job guys. Congrats 🎉
Why is a sub-40 second race over 10 minutes long?
Noah Lyles is looking like a WORLD champion
Worst passes....wow.  But they got the job DONE!!!!
If the first two legs of Italy catch-up with the last two, they'll be gold medalist next time. Yikes!
The NBA is forever
Didn't like Lyes' last comment tbh
I didn't know who Noah was until now, shout out to Italy's Team ! Congrats on the silver
USA 🇺🇸 ❤❤❤
The Jamaicans are like fans of the '85 Bears.  They'll be living in the past for the next 50 years.
Italy was so happy! His silver was pretty much Gold to him.
Good stuff! Congrats!
Watching the men’s 4x100 team win the gold medal in the World Championships reminds me of my son on his 4x100 team winning the state championship in that event. Christian Coleman’s team came in second 😎
Race starts at 4:00
Race starts at 4:00
The dude who got 4th has to pay his bookie…
noah carried
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾❤️
I love NOAH ‼️
Japan was super impressive, only doomed by that last hand-off.
Anyone likely to challenge Carnes for a spot on the 4x100 in Paris for USA? Honestly, I think Knighton could be a candidate if he wants, runs the turn very well, and taking the baton as the 3rd leg would allow him to have built up plenty of speed once he gets the baton.
Lyles anchor reminded me of Usain’s 2012 anchor, getting the baton with the narrowest lead and finishing by blowing out the competition
At 7:12. Why did the commentator say that none of it matters, (the poor baton passing) when it really does in a close race. I'm very happy they won but that can cause them the race.
*Man, I had to watch the end **4:30** like 10 times. Noah's acceleration is no joke  & leaves no doubt who the winner is - even though he was facing extremely tough competition*
I’m so proud of those young men! Dayum they are fast! Noah looked like he had a nitro pack attached! Well done y’all 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸.      Congratulations and props to Italy 🇮🇹 Ben fatto!!
FBA all day.
Congratulations to the young Jamaican they will do better next year God bless
Please reprimand the person that set up this video with an ad in the middle of a 40 second race.  Set before, after, or both but not during.  Absolute hogwash.  Thanks for killing the whole vibe.
Italia finishing crazy strong
Sheesh, lyles left everyone in the dust! 2024!
The fact that Italy came in 2nd is amazing because they look like marathon runners 😂😂
USA needs to start our legs quicker.. we run up on two of the 3.  Could have shaved a good half second off the time.
The first and second handoffs were not great.  The runners got a late start and were not up to speed when they received the baton.  Still a great performance, but there was quite a bit more there.
Italy was determined  to get that silver... they was moving... dope for them to appreciate medaling... it aint all about gold
Tortu, Amazing as ever on ancor
Tortu for Italy is a great anchor for the 4x1
Man Italy last leg is a beast. That's the same dude that won them the Olympic gold.
Boy I had to rewind to watch Italy... They was sliding
I am truly elated at the Georgia Bulldogs being blessed with getting the "slegehammer"  Christopher Jones  added to rhe championship  program .  He is a dynamic talent that will be an  inhanced terror to the SEC.     I look forward to seeing  a year of the offense scoring at will. And a "shutdown defense "  controlling the other side of the ball.  Continued Success  is your destiny starting in 2024
We are the most athletic country on the planet. Feels good
Amazing. Congratulations
Why did abc label this the dream team?? The disrespect 😮
❤❤❤❤
These young Gifted, swift, and talented black men should be respected not only as they are running for the U.S., but also when they are just being ordinary citizens in this country. Respect is  desperately lacking in this country for these young black men who are willing to use their God- given speed & talents in order to WIN big for the  U.S.
Oblique Seville second leg was disgusting; Congrats to the US nonetheless
Nice USA. Italy’s anchor kicking into high gear! Wow
If they could clean up those passes... they'd be challenging the WR.
I have watched the race time and time again, and each time my heart palpitates. The speed and skills of these athletes blows me away. Wahoo!
Congratulations!!  Gotta Love It !!  You won!!  The BATON EXCHANGES were very suspect and I know why.  Nevertheless, you won.  I can help with the baton exchanges, believe it or not.  I can "right the ship" for future events and the Olympics.
Ngl Japan was moving frl
Thought they said this dude was going to break the record 🤡
Bro was laid out like he had a chance 🤣
Black ppl are really gifted. I mean it's just obvious now
Wish they wouldn’t spoil the result in the title.
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
“I’ma be on it” 🤣😂
Those passes weren't great but Noah could have spotted the fire 5 m & would have won. Italy I'm impressed, good run.
Quite a weekend for the new fastest man in the world. And its not even close. King Noah congrats!!!!
Yay USA. But Italy is fast!  It's always USA vs Jamaica 😲
Putting a commercial right at the anchor exchange? This video deserves downvotes just for that.
Those young Jamaicans with time they will be a scary bunch
Congratulations
Very good job very of you and the USA teams
These guys are professionals. How come they always mess up the baton exchanges. Smh. Anyways, congratulations to the US team.
Y Italy doin allat like they won 2nd ain’t 1st, silver ain’t gold
Handoffs we’re horrible smh we have to do wayyy better!  They may have a chance to crack the record if they can get it right.  C’mon USA!  Every year  😩🤦🏽‍♂️
Wonderful!!!
Jamaica let a white dude smoke them lmao
Like on a serious note I’ve ran track(not at this level) I see kids in middle school with better handoff than united state track teams
👑👑👑👑
Blessed 🙏🏻
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Legend
White boy in the blue had it goin on
Goodshit italiano!
That was an amazing team effort. Top 4 teams all ran avg 9.3-9.4 splits. Thats insane!
Na deadass.. Did she run an 11.5 on the the last 100... thats fucking  insane...
those passes were HORRENDOUS!!!!!
How about Italy silver
Great job gentlemen were proud of you.
usa still got the ugliest baton passes LOL. regardless they still got it. Imagine if they got a smoother pass
Italy actually held their own, I was surprised. Congratulation USA!!! And keep an eye out for Italy.
Upmost respect to everyone that competes in these and marathons , (went jogging 2 laps the other day n threw up 🤣) ain’t easy staying fit big ups to y’all frfr 🫡
The Italians happy as 💩 that they beat the Jamaicans. Never seen anyone in my life so excited to get second 😆
❤❤❤❤
holy F Noah is the chosen one
Lyles top end speed 😮bruh is insane
what was it like to hear that gun shot go off? LMAO...…
we are notorius throughout the history to drop buttons and now passing the line ,  why is it so hard to hand a button to someone else and why is it so hard to do it within given yellow line ?? even a trained monkey can do a better job than us
Italy finished like they won first, love it.
Team USA made me smile. I'm glad to be a Californian!
Noah is a warrior destined for greatness
Not only did Noah win 1 or 2 GOLD medals but 3🥇 🥇 🥇
The way Noah and sha'Carri accelerate
Just seeing my American men all wrapped up in the flag with their gold just puts a smile to my face
Congrats on the nba
Congrats USA!  Will any of these guys play in the NFL?
Japan's hand offs are maximizing the finish of each leg.
Dam! The Jamaicans fell off this year..Congratulations to USA..Thank you to all the black men and women for holding it down..so 👏🏾 😊proud!
We have to do better on our baton passing.
At the last hand off everyone was like dang we up here with Noah.. Then Noah was like Nah man......not today, see ya...
❤🇺🇸🎉
What about Italy out of NOWHERE though?  Those legs were effin crazy too
Those were all suspect exchanges! Borderline drop on the last! 😮😵‍💫😵😮‍💨❤
Lol. They all knew the inside joke about the gun going off. They didn’t have to say amything😂😂
What is up with this hex on the USA Mens handoffs, they always seem shaky.
we are notorius throughout the history to drop buttons and now passing the line ,  why is it so hard to hand a button to someone else and why is it so hard to do it within given yellow line ?? even a trained monkey can do a better job than us
Those were some hella suspect passes but passing in the 4x1 is the hardest of any relay event as every runner is still going full on into the exchange.  Just glad nobody dropped anything or passed outside the exchange zone...whew!  Congrats Team USA!!!
Italy was smoking fast, as well.  What a beautiful race!!!  Amazing.  I watched it numerous times-- each time watching a different team.  5 teams within a half second.
Wow, that was a beautiful performance, whooorah! Go Team USA
“I’ma be on it!” 😂😂😂
FBA ALL DAY!
Man we can never hand off nothing lol congrats 🍾
You got to give it to that Italian dude too. He was 3rd or 4th on the handoff.
Salute.
Just like the ladies, I need them to get these passes together 😅
Team USA really needs to do something about baton passing.They r really poor in passing baton
why does USA makes so much errors in the hand offs , why don't they practice?? we are sick and tired of it , nice job anyways , USA
Noah a beast he took off like a jet. 🥰😁
man those transfers were awful
Noah’s personality is EVERYTHING ! Definitely @ the dream team for Olympics 2024 ! 🎉
What is it with the U.S. Men's team and baton passes? It seems like it's always a challenge. In this case do I see the receiver getting the take hand up late?
Italy was moving. WOW!!!!
Don't forget Bolt lost in one of the relays to the American.  He never was not able to close the gap.  Things can go differently in a relay.
Wonderful race for the USA, hats off to Italy.
Did anyone notice the anchor for Japan? He was closing that gap fast
Congrats Team USA!!!
I love to watch the American rivals come together and create magic. USA! (And thank god for luck with those passes 🤣)  Speaking of passes- let’s not overlook Italy’s! Molto bene! 👨🏻‍🍳🤌🏼💋
first 3 handoffs were horrible but noah is just THAT GUY!!!! he cannot be touched rn
Commentator was right, “3 suspect passes” and they still won easily going away.  Hard to beat if cleaner passes
Happy for the guys Noah goin be a problem for years to come
Wow! Wow! Go USA
Hit that NOS button on them
The Olympics in Paris is going to be phenomenal! Go USA!
This is really awesome wow great athletes
These boys are killing it..... congratulations! Nice showing!!!!
Without Bolt, Jamaica don't have it.🇺🇸
Congratulations USA MEN
Japan doesn't have enough black guys to be competitive
CONGRATULATIONS TEAM USA!!!...GOLD CHAMPIONS 🏆🏆🏆🏆🥇🥇 🥇 🏅
I HOPE NO DRUGS WERE INVOLVED
Anyone want to talk about how Italy was bringing the smoke?
Sheesh those were horrible passes of the baton! That could have fared horribly, but thankfully they kept their composure.
just think of how much more amazing they would be if they learn how to pass the baton
Hand-offs are critical.  If a USA team gets all of those just right they will set a world record.
That last past was shakyyyyyy but hey THEY DID IT 😌😌
Noah Lyles has a gear above everyone else.
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👍🏾💪🏾
Noah Lyles truly is other worldly. WOW.
USA 🇺🇸 ✊🏾
Reminds me a bit of Michael Johnson.
Yes Sir!
Bro looked laughed and said shii I’mma be on it and looked at them 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🐐
Congratulations!
Let’s gooo 🇺🇸
Italy was hanging on lol. Let’s Go Gold
🇮🇹 🇮🇹
Noah’s Top Gear is DIFFERENT!!! 👀👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
BEAST!!!
Way to go usa
why does USA makes so much errors in the hand offs , why don't they practice??
I feel like if they had good handoffs that would’ve been a wr
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
USAAAAA
Good Run Jamaica!!!
America CLEARYYYY Breeda The Greatest Athletes . Bolt is the outlier .
Noah Lyles vs Usain Bolt would've been epic
🥳🎉🙌🏾🙌🏾🇺🇲❤️🤍💙
USA
Wohooo!!! Spectacular performance by these 4 great athletes Goosebumps while watching  So proud of Team USA Thank you guys for doing your best.🙏♥️🏅🇺🇸
Thank You Commentators for doubling down on the excitement 🎉
Congratulations guys 4x👑💐
Noah was smoking! And how about Italy??
Alright now, Italy! Gave me a scare there, threatening Team USA (and Jamaica) for the title!
Noah is the charisma that track and field needs. He is amazing!!!! Good job America.
Noah is a beast 🤟🏾🤟🏾🔥🔥
Go lyles!!! He's got it, the will of fire 🔥
this noah guy is special
When did Italy get so fast?
Noah was born in the wrong generations. He would have beaten Bolt multiple times
It’s the Italians celebrating silver that is so wholesome for me!! Good job USA, Italy, and Jamaica!
Congrats to the U.S. Shout out to Italy also for making a statement.
Who said american's can't run!!! Congratulations to the men's track team!!!
USA n the “hand off curse” hhhmmmm……… dis better not happen @ the Olympics
Wow!!!!!!!
And we run for gold while folks in America want their country back, but when we win, Noah Lyles, Sha'Carri Richardson, Simone Biles, etc., etc., etc. then we're all Americans...yall funny. Until we're accepted for who we are and what we contribute to this country, America won't have peace. Congratulations fellas!!! Yall make us proud!!!❤🇺🇸❤
“Suspect passes”. 😂😂😂
USA Baton passes once again were absolute garBAGE 🗑️ but thankfully Noah has alllll the 🦵🏾’s to battle it out. Great race, all!
Glad Jamaica is getting beat by the USA most of the time now.
congratulations USA 🇺🇸 Italy 🇮🇹 lo hiso bien dejó atrás al fuerte equipo de jamaica 🇯🇲
Lyles is an actual monster. Good lord.
Wtf with these no hands up straight back & steady baton passing.   Goodness
Jamaica with the bronze! 🇯🇲
Incredible comback for Japan!
Congrats USA 🇺🇸. Just think if the baton passes were smoother their time would’ve been even more amazing!!
yesssssssssssss
Commenting to help US GDP #1
Ayy
Noah lyles accelerating is fire 🔥
🔥🔥🔥
Italy’s anchors an impressive run
Italians are celebrating harder than USA lol
Good job USA!
Amazing Team US
“Ima be on it!” 😂 True legend great things to come for this great athlete.
Congratulations 🎉
USA most of the time have trouble with the passing of the baton.  They need to perfect that and if they do they might have a chance of breaking the WR.
Yes, Team USA Men's 4x100m Relay!
The USA will never not being completely awful at passes.
Congrats Noah you did not break Bolts record as u promise in the 100 200 bluff lol go Bolt ❤️🙏
Ok Italy😮
@nbcsports I love that Noah has the Olympic laurel in his hair
TEAM USA SPRINTERS OVER THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We back baby!!
Talk about acceleration yikes!!! You Noah the name👌🏽
Congratulations to the Italians the we’re ready great😅
Christian Coleman is a beautiful young man. I imagine he will be sponsored by Colgate or Crest after the Olympics 😁😁🪥🪥🪥He is simply GEORGEOUS..  Great run guyes.😀
KFC sounds good rn
Awesome, but not unexpected.   The huge story here is that the Italians, the freaking Italians beat the Jamaican's, "ain't nobody got time for that".
With a better handoff and maybe a phenomenal performance by the anchor & Japan couldve pulled that out
If it was allowed USA could run at least,,,,,,two teams and medal men and women....I've watched over 50 times
9 WORLD TITLES!!!!!    The US sets the standard
Awesome race. Congratulations Team USA
Noah said “I’m gone be on it”.
Crazy once usain bolt retired that usa #1 and Jamaica #3
Does anyone know who the announcers are?
The way Noah Lyles ran that anchor leg after not getting the best exchange was incredible. It is the Superstar of track & field now on the men's side.
would be dope not to have spoilers in the title
USA always with the worst baton passes.  STILL getting the job done 😮.  Love it.
Poor stick passing for professionals.   🫣
RAHHHHH🦅🦅🦅
Simply the  Best ! No competition
How about it for the INDIGENOUS AMERICANS. It's about time to tell THE TRUTH.
Dude top end speed is serious
Noah Lyles is the most Egotistical Athlete in the history of Track and Field.
I'd love to know the joke behind the world "sensational" and Kerley's comment about " you know how track and field works". Intrigued. Congrats fellows :)
What a great time to be a track and field fan. Go USA!
One of the best 4x100 I have ever seen
That 3rd Leg for Italy got jets he took off and put them in a good position for a 2nd place finish
Italy beat Jamaica?!😮
USA...yeah we got 'unwalkable' cities, homeless, bad politics, bad history etc. But we can always be proud that we're so good at sports 🏅💪🇺🇲
Noah nice but he corny fr
That kid lyels is fast
Wow italy did well..but usa team is too strong..great job 🎉🎉
I know Usain wishes he was in there lol
Jamaica need fi fire the anchor leg!! Chuh!😡 should have second place!!
So proud and Happy for a 941 Bradenton, Florida native Brandon Carnes he has always been a great athlete but we all knew he was born to be on this international stage doing his purpose, we proud of him in Manatee county
RAHHHHHH 🦅🦅🦅🦅
"IMA BE ON IT"
As Ato had mentioned, this is the first Men's 4x100 win in a while. We had been snake bit in this particular event. But these exceptional athletes made us proud and pulled out. Coupled with the Women's 4x100, we made history again.  Looking forward to the Olympics. GO 🇺🇸 😊
Lyles just needed to be on pair.
Noah just glides when he runs!
NOAH was right about the trash NBA saying they world champions that's how illiterate the NBA is world champions of your own league WAFJ
"Imma be on it" was the worst answer ever smh
Lyles cookin
Why doesn’t knighton run the relays ?
Well done, men!  USA!!
If the USA men and women, team can get their baton passing down they would be unstoppable. Who is coaching these athletes???
Jamaica had a “wokless” showing @ this meet… 🤔😆
USA team is now back as the king of 4x100m drag race! Congratulations!!!😍😍😍
Great‼️ job go USA 🇺🇸
Get the win with terrible handoffs too. All running up on each other. Dude switching hands mid run handing off to Lyles. But hey a win is a win.
Lyles is legit a Unicorn, We’re witnessing greatness
CONGRATULATIONS U.S.A, OUTSTANDING JOB 👏.  9 METALS. GO U.S.A
Christian Coleman is the BEST 1st leg runner ever❤
Congratulations to team USA - they got the button change and right 😀
Bad exchanges through all handoffs and still won
USA baby
Congratulations to the US team!  Lyles blew them away on the anchor leg.  But watch the race again and watch the Italian on the anchor leg, he ran a great race to bury Jamaica.
Nobody paid any attention To dude just laying there lol
Is this the team for Paris?  Noah: I’m gonna be on it  This had me laughing but it’s true. 😂
Sensational! 😂
Noah stride is ridiculously long and smooth
🤎💨💨💨💨💨💨
Bro if these handoffs were good times would of been way gaster
Beast
Fred looked like he wasn't trying to even put the baton in the hand of Lyles !  Bad handoffs :( great win :)
Congratulations🎉
I love that comment at the end, "It's a drag race...."!!!  Good job Team USA!!!
Has anyone done a deep dive into how Italy has become a sprinting power?  Since when does an Italian anchor not named Marcel Jacobs blow away Jamaica and Great Britian?  What if Jacobs was in form during these Worlds?  What's going on here?  lol
YEAH WE DID IT. 2024 WILL BE GOLD IN ALL TRACK AND FIELD ❤
Those baton passes were atrocious, but Coleman passed well. We need to practice more team USA. If USA hadn’t fumbled, they would have run under 37 seconds like they should have
Let’s goooo🫡
This is an all time epic team USA
Imagine if their baton passes were cleaner... Still an amazing job by the US team!
Jesus christ they are fast, slowed down looks about an average guys speed.
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
LETS  FCKING  GOOOOOOO🎉
Erriyon Knighton will end up on the 3rd leg
NOAH is the truth.   Keep doing your thing.
Im on it cold but true. You kniw how track 😮
Noah has earned $160,000 USD at these championships!
why crayvont charleston didn’t run in the 4x100m final 2023 world championship?
Do it without steroids
This race was all about Jamaica vs Italy for silver everyone knew who was gonna get gold
Noah lyles and the American team are amazing
Japan usually is great at the passes. They bundled the last pass. Brown was the fastest finisher in the last leg. It would have been very interesting if they make a good pass
I was impressed with japan. They were moving pretty quick too
Well done guys. So proud of you 🇺🇸
US needs to spend a lot of time on the baton passing.  This has been a systemic issue.  Congrats USA
IMO if the USA baton passes was like Italy’s they would have shattered the world record.
that boy is just different!!!!
It doesn't even look like Noah was giving 100%. He had more speed in him. Love it!
Reporter: Is this the team for Paris?  Noah: Psshhh imma be on it!   Wildest statement in the video 😂😂😂
Congratulations Team USA!!!!!!4x100
Am I the only one who noticed that Tortu killed it?
Way to go Italy.   You should be proud.
Great race. The number of teams in the finish was awesome.
bro this mf isn't real dawg
Why did the "drag" comment have to be said? That's disrespectful and makes it seem like you're relating it to men posing as women. Do better....it was a great race besides the hand offs.
I know people like to say this person is the next Usain Bolt, and all that. I think Noah Lyles is a new Noah Lyles. His acceleration is so much faster than everybody else’s.
Why didn’t they put Kenny Bednarek in?
🔥 🔥 💨
Sensational
Congrats Team USA!👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Italy 🎉 wow
The American athletes sleeps but they never rest.
...I bet nobody noticed South Africa drop the baton at 4:21😮
WHAT YOU GONNA DO WHEN THESE STARS AND STRIPES RUN LOOSE ON YOU!!!! WHOOOO!
USA!   USA!   USA!
Watch that Italian last leg, dude was getting it. I'm impressed.
Respect!!! BurnettFamNC21
💯❤️🏆🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Congratulations 🍾 🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾
Side note: that has to be the fastest Italians ever
Usain Bolt was the last person to meet this kind of performance.
Glorious!✝️💪🏽🇺🇸🥇
Great 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
Italy had 3 "perfect" handoffs 🤯 Rarely do I see 3/3 really clean baton passes in the 4×100.
US your baton exchange is the worst!, How long are you going to continue these lapses? Receive with your left change to your right so you can give it to the next person's left hand to change to his or her right hand!!!
CONGRATULATIONS USA
They betta do this at the Olympics next year 🫡
that's what we do!!! the best of USA FBA's all day representing
VA please stand up🙌🏾💪🏾
If we get back to educating our children, I know the the results would be reflected. The dedication, hardwork, consistency paid off for these young men. This behavior must be reflected in these inner school. I know for a fact that these inner city students can rise up.
USA POWER! Just clean up the handoffs a little
Way to go team USA we finally taking the stand over Jamaica  after a long reign congrats
FAST
Anybody notice Japan catching the pack on the last leg? lol
Noah say idk about everybody else but I'll be there.
USA IS 🔥.  Italian guy running and screaming like he won gold.  😂😂
Noah is the Noah’s ark of track. He always rises to the top’. Great  run USA but I have to give a hand to the Italian team amazing second place finish.
the way lyles pops with every successive lunge is power and timing that you dont see replicated even in worlds he belongs in the serengeti desert with that type lunging.
USA!!!
Yayyy 🎉🎉🎉 USA, ITALY AND JAMAICA ❤ Great race woww
Kanye west is going to make him a song, that is being insinuated.
I don't see bolt or Blake original
👏🏻
Congratulations  USA Men’s 4x 100 Gold Win 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
USA❤
Thats Right Noah❤
Yeah watching this over yeppers he picked them up and put them down
That boy patta mvp 😂💯
USA…..USA…….USA
Coleman and Lyles spot should be a lock in. Coleman is out the blocks like a beast and Lyles acceleration is beyond beastly. His speed is just insane not to mention his endurance level!!!
Italy is insane
Christian Coleman take off speed is the best ive ever seen
Great job fellas!
You go guys! Yes!
Very surprised Canada didn't participate in this. Maybe they knew this was USA year. Idk
Coleman has the best start ever… He can really eat that curb… Noah is Finisher … Point Bank!
When they get them handoffs down its gon be crazy
Props to Italy, but USA is in a whole different league! Wasn’t even close, Lyles smoked the field and no one was even close!  Props to Italy for duking it out with the rest of the field and winning a silver medal.
If they got the handoffs down theyd shave time
Why are the camera angles so awful? Aren’t there multiple cameras available to get a closer look on the track?
People seem to want slam Carnes without realizing he bailed out a potential DQ.  Fred perhaps signaled late and ran up on Carnes and missed his hand.  Carnes managed to find the baton without looking back and snatch it.  5:55 You can hear Fred "my bad" to Carnes after the race. And while Carnes' exchange to Noah wasn't like the Italians, he adjusted and made sure Noah had a good piece of baton on the exchange.
Yes Noah..and Richardson🎉🎉
Lyles🔥🔥🔥🔥To Fast.
Good JOB TEAM USA
Big Up to Jamaica too!!
So proud of all of our Young Anericans!!
I was impressed with Italy.
Absolute domination over teams that tryhard their baton training 🤣🤣
Outstanding!
Amazing USA performance but what is the deal with Italy? Wow impressive second place!
Compare Japan's baton passes to the US baton passes. Underhand is superior to that overhand mess.
Italy did their thing though!
Congratulations
Noah: *Looks to random Jamaican* Tell your friends what you saw here today..
Team USA🎉🎉🎉🎉 Noah Lyles be skating
USA! 🚀🦅🦅🦅🇺🇸
Ayo. USA all day but Italy ate that anchor leg Frfr
Lewis Johnson is well liked too
A bit more on the blocks equals record time.
2:29 Charlie Puth sighting
Mr. Bolden does a great job announcing, NBC hit gold with him. Lyle has not peaked yet. He's still on the way up.
We back! America
Teethfos...
Way to Go Team USA! 💪🏾👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽❤️
Italy didn't have a smooth handoff on the last leg. But their last guy had an absolute burner.  A better handoff and we may have had a different outcome. He may have had the best last leg (to me).  Anyway, I expect USA to win because of the sports technology we have here, but Bravo to Italy as well!
Cool to see Italy get silver.
Paris is going to be 🔥!
Woooohhhhhh sheeeaaattt
USA takes it of course…shoutout to them Italy boys doe they came outta nowhere after the 3rd leg
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Imagine how fast they would have been if they just practiced their handoffs until they perfected them.
FBA GREATNESS ✊🏾✊🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾!!!  WE ARE DOMINANT....
Carnes probably deserves more credit than is apparent. Kerley shouted only after he was practically on top of Carnes. He stuck his arm up, but Fred missed it, Carnes, without looking back, found it, and snatched it. Then, although it looked like he was thinking about changing hands,  was probably adjusting it to make a secure exchange to Noah.  Two pinch points avoided. Even in the previous round, although very perilous, he made sure the anchor got that baton.
The Italians thooo. Good job 👏🏽
If they perfect those handoffs they will really be unstoppable! But huge shout out to Italy anchor he was booking it as well!
Team USA is gonna be scary next year.
Lets Goooo 💥 👏
Jamaica smoke some bud before the race
Italy really out here gettin fast last 5 years.....
🇺🇸
I like mocha lattes with the foam on the top
Never seen someone so happy to be second lol, but good for them.
Nobody talking about the fourth leg for Italy .. man got wheels
That anchor for Italy was moving too... good god
When they change leg 2 they’ll be a top 3 team all time
Great job beautiful men!!
We really need to clean up the passes. Even if we have the fastest people if the baton doesn’t go around, it doesn’t matter! Noah killing it though!
Imma be on!!! Noah lyles says enough about his confidence hilarious 😂😂😂😂
💪🏽 🎉MY USA BOYS👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽😁🇺🇲🥇🥇🥇🥇
WAY TO GO 🇺🇸! The way Lyles finished, though!!!! Wow, is all I can say!!! Way to go, 🇮🇹 & 🇯🇲!!!!❤
I LOVE YOU NOAH!! YOU ARE A BEAST!!✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Nah that Italy anchor definitely woulda caught up a few more seconds dude got them back in the rave
Great job team USA but, why isn't Knighton running the 3rd leg??? Please explain that to me.....
Oh my goodness
When you have 3 world champions on ur relay team😭
Noah Lyles is a great runner, the only thing is that he needs to be humbled, he's kind a too cocky now kind a show off a little bit, just saying.
Noah is not playing
Once we get the handoffs together  we could definitely set a new world record.
Lmao the Italians are so happy with 2nd place 😭
❤️🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸❤️
I wanna see tyreek hill in this
Once again, this could have been a disaster for the US.
Im proud of our boys but I do miss the steroid era in track and field....😢
I wish Jacob ran with Noah on the last leg
Wow, that really was sensational!!! 🔥🔥🔥 Congratulations to Team USA on the Gold!!! 🎉🎉🎉🥇👏🏾 Christian Coleman’s start is insane, he is just soo fast! Three Gold medals for Noah Lyles and they added another World record! Let’s go Team USA! ❤🇺🇸👏🏾
that gear the italian anchor kicked in at the end gave me a chill or two too
Congratulations and continue to encourage one another. We are all in this together. ❤
Congratulations USA!!
The  secondary commentator is to much
I would have love to see Erriyon Knighton run 3rd leg…
Congrats to USA and hats off to Italy!
Love it, I ran track in high school some 50 years ago....lol.
Congratulations Team USA..
The announcer sounded suspect with attitude towards these talented men. Congrats USA! Good relay
Jesus Christ.. those first 2 exchanged usa.. wtf
USA USA USA !!!!!!! 😭 🇺🇸
the video representation of why men make more money than women in sports. The women got DQ'd.. Men win!!
Great Job 👍 Fellas USA 🏃‍♀️ 🔥 🏃‍♂️ 🔥 🏃‍♀️ 🔥 🏃‍♀️ 🔥
❤
Why kerly look so salty!
"Is this the team for Paris"? Noah- "I'm a be on it" 😂😂😂🎉
Congratulations 🎊🎈🍾🎉! Team USA … that having been said !! We sure have a problem with the baton passes ! This cost the women 4x400 and this has 3 sloppy passes  despite the win, that could have gone left …! I’m alarmed ! Can this be nipped in the bud ! It is just disastrous ! 😱….
Love the italian kiss to the camera
Bad handoffs but great runs. If the baton would keep moving without slowing down they would deff break the record.
🎉🎉let’s go team USA
UNITED STATES of AMERICA🦅🦅 God Bless Black People ⭐⭐
Great race
4:28 did Carnes try to switch hands before the pass to Lyles?!? Or was he losing his grip on the baton?
How come NBC didn’t cover Sha-Cari Richardson during her race?
I really love when other countries like Italy aNd Great Britain are contenders .. it shows their dedication to the sport
fred vs noah is going to be crazy next year!
Italians were 1st last year right?  🤣🤣🤣 That’s so funny.
actual race starts at 3:53
If not for Noah, Italy would have won again😊
Beautiful race by the field in general
Lewis asking dumb questions. How would they know if this is the team for Paris? Bro who ran the third leg might get replaced.
The perfect sprinter…. Christian Coleman’s start, Usain Bolt’s stride/ acceleration, Noah lyles finish
Thank you guys. We salute you.
🎉🇺🇸
Congratulations... An exciting race 🥇🥇🥇🥇
Go Team USA!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Special
Why isn't erriyon knighton in this relay??
Dope🔥🤟🏾.
NBC. Great coverage. But no need to spoil the ending in the title.
He's got the Jets huh
Usa 🇺🇸 ❤
Brandon Carnes make USA win this one.  All 3 others did run good.  But Mr. Carnes grip the baton which is hard to get it handed to him wrong way by 2nd runner.  It was amazing he catch it without sacrificing the speed.  We almost lost the competition without his animal like instinct.  I admire him.
Way to go USA❤
Its just unfortunate to have all that talent but no professionalism or vocabulary. ShaCarri got her media training. Noah is next. Poor Bowie had great talent too and couldnt articulate herself. RIP😢
looked like team Italy was having a moment at 6:00 😘😂
Italy celebrating like they won gold. 😂. Silver is still a great feat nonetheless
Noah  dusted them it wasn't even close once he  hit his  40m stride.
Would be nice to get to watch this without the results being spoiled....
It’s just amazing how Noah doesn’t even look like he’s straining or stressing himself when he runs.. it’s just effortless! Man, am I proud of all of these black men 🤎
Woo Hoooooo!🔥🔥🔥🔥💙💙💙💙🥇🥇🥇🥇Congratulations!
Those hand offs were terrible, but their legs were strong enough for it not to matter
Awesome team USA!! Lyles killed it.
🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷
Game over 🇺🇸
Dominant win with terrible passes
That giant megawatt smile.  <3
Imagine if US had the smoothest handoffs ever 😳
Italians sus😂
Okay Italy
Why can't either of them get the baton exchange correct , why , who's coaching them ?
Italy beating Jamica in a sprint was not on my bingo card
Noah lyles is just different…it is definitely his time 🫡🙏🏾🙏🏾♥️
🇺🇸 They made it look easy. Feel sorry for Japan tho, They could have been in the food but man the Italian were 😮 wow…
Italy with the closing speed......SHEEESH
Noah did his thing...go USA 🔥🔥🔥
Congratulations to the USA team. Undoubtedly the best athletes the world have ever seen🎉!
I would have put Knighton on 3rd but he’s mad young and these passes are already suspect , good win fellas
Was awesome congratulations team USA!!
There's something about Noah lyles. He's too cocky & full of himself
I definitely think this USA team can potentially break 37 or at least come close if they get those handoffs right. There's a ton of room for improvement.
Bad passing but great running❤
Salute to Noah Lyles & Sha'Carri Richrdson for their excellence in these games. As young as they are, all I can say is "watch out world" because those names will be ringing loud and clear for years to come!!! USA.....
Noah is a mess lol “I’m going be on it!!!”
Holy mother of god !!!!!!!! These boys were fast as f**k BOIIIII
Noah finish is just monstruos 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Congratulations team USA 🇺🇸🎉 Noah Lyles, Fred, Christian, and Carns great teamwork. Also, congrats to Italy they did amazing too. It was funny the guys didn’t even look back at the baton everyone was on 💨 fast mood. May God bless everyone. 🙏🎉
lol Italy was hella hyped for 2nd place 😂
Come on America United States of America are you paying attention? Who is the real winners? Is the people of color African-American brothers but yet you hate them you treat them like crap in America what’s wrong with you people and yet they getting all these gold medals for you but this is what it’s about jealousy jealousy these boys a bad feel bad boys and they know what they doing. God bless you all. God bless you my brother’s.
congrats to them boys
🇺🇸💪🏾🫵🏽
Im impressed Italy!
US take over in Paris
I love the win, but they act like they've never did a hand off before?
And team USA
I’m team Noah
Congratulations to the usa men!. Great run!. 💪♾️✝️🦁👑🙏
CONGRATS TO THE AMERICAN ABORIGINES NOAH LYLES  AND THE REST
USA next level but Italy was insane too, especially Tortu.
🔥🔥🔥
Noah turned on the jets.
too bad they ignored Italy's amazing speed, one little mistake and it would be them celebrating but the announcers missed it
Noah Lyles  the  monster
when will we ever have good passes (,:
There we go!
8:15 😂😂😂😂   Kerely's reaction to the interviewer saying it was Coleman's responsibility to pop it off explains the laughter at the beginning of the interview. Thats freaking hilarious 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Italy crossed acting like they won. 😂
Italy beating Jamaica is wild 😂🎉
That was ugly and that won't get it in the Olympics  next year.
Congratulation to the winners and special congratulations to the Jamaican men finally winning a bronze medal
team USA run super fast
2nd to 3rd leg gotta do better with the hand off!
Man i wouldve loved to see Lyles up against Bolt in this.
Noah is unbelievable that’s all imma say.
This is the Noah lyles era! Hands down
The Italian anchor gave me pause for about 2 beats but Lyles was not to be denied.
That Italian was fucking flying on final leg! wow  Lyles just too much.
Does NBC Sports ever post a video without spoiling the result?
We’re back on top, you haters! 💯😆
Tortu is always a clutch anchor leg for Italy!
Rocket men Lyles and Coleman strike again
Race starts at 4:00
Italy just happy to be numero dos😂
Not going to lie, they should’ve won by a mile…..they won even though the baton passing was terrible
They got lucky. I am sorry to say this, but the hand-offs are terrible, they still can't shake off their Achilles heels.
The United States is back.  I love the competition with Jamaica but right now the men and women of the USA are the ones to look out for.Noah Lyles is unbeatable right now at 200. He might be the best at 100 considering how fast he caught on and learned to run that distance.
Congrats to Italy on the silver! They were so happy! I love that for them. 🇺🇸🇯🇲 were expected to metal. No surprise there.
Our ppl are Absolutely Amazing!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Congratulations Kings & Queens🤎
The fastest man in the world🇺🇸
Noah’s stride is so long. Flexibility in those quads and hamstrings is beautiful! 🤌👌👏
That separation by Lyles 😤 BOOSTERS!
Great job 👏🏾 USA 🇺🇸 ❤
Tremendous performance by Team USA. Lyles totally unstoppable. Amazing
He’s just way ahead of his competition😂
If you're not already ahead of Noah going into the anchor leg, you may as well just fight for 2nd.
Go USA…Proud if the Italians too🤘🏼👏🏼
USA 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Noah on beast mode
My god, he has the three peat
LET’S GO!!! ❤ So proud of you all…congrats 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Add Knighton at third leg and they will be untouchable
Good job
Please replace Carnes with Erriyon Knighten. Carnes lost the lead. Knighten is way faster than  Carnes and is a good curve runner. Add Knighten, instant world record
LOL  10:06
Japan had such a bad pass at the end 😢
Thank God that you're that GUY Lyles.
Why, don't they put arriyon Knighton in third leg?
Noah Lyles runs like it’s not effort at all!
Love this kid… you welcome Amerikkka
Italy was too hype lol
YUMMY YUMMY 👍 👊 ✌️🙏
Noah Lyles hit a gear no one else had.
Thanks to Noah or they would have lost. USA has history of bad passes in this. They need to spend more time on it.
🔴 LET'S GO USA 🇺🇸❗️💪🏾💯
if the handoffs were a little better, they could've gotten close to the world record or even beat it
Congratulations, the USA Team should be very proud. But, please practice the baton exchange. With Bolt retired, it's the Men's biggest challenge.
LET'S GO NOAH 😂😂❤❤❤USA WE IT BABY🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😂❤❤
Sensational ❤
Imagine an American Football Olympics with this world-level competition. I wish
Mens & women 🏃‍♂️ 🚆 🏃‍♀️  nice 👌
Congratulations 🇺🇸
Noah the truth!!!
Congrats to the whole 4x100 team. Passes were a little messy but whats important is that you won. Im glad Kerley got a gold. I hope that helps him feel a little better!🙏
I don’t follow track much but Italy over Jamaica is wild😂
Can we talk about how impressive Italy was? That last leg was MOVING.
Noah Lyles flashes white power symbol at World Championship 😮.
wow! Jamaica got smoked by Italy
Congratulations to team USA!
Georgia dudes funny, they think they dominate everything and everybody but they don’t and they can’t. It’s a misconception.
Jamaica almost didn't medal 😮
the fact italy was that happy coming 2nd tells me they knew they had no chance beating team usa 🤣
There's only one USA Dream Team and it's trademarked...
Good win! Practice on them handoffs
Way to go, USA!  What a thrilling race!!!!!!
Jacobs will win gold in olympics
Congratulations to all the winner 🎉✨🤩😍❤️‍🔥
🫡 God Bless the USA
🇺🇸 all day 👏
If the U.S. would ever down their baton passes down pat they would break the world record.
Ok while Noah is definitely all about shelf he is FAST!
Italy's passes were clean, huge shout out to them
Good job and all but it’s disheartening to see them flaunting a flag of oppression so openly.
Lyles was COOKIN'!
This dude is dominating it this year.. wow
I ran track with Brandon carnes in high school!
The US is incredibly fast. Think of what they could do if they had good passes. Also, that Italian anchor was really fast.
USA 🇺🇸🥇
Happy for the USA but the baton passes scare me.
Ive been waiting for this 4x100 hoping Noah would get his 3rd gold. CONGRATULATIONS young man representing proudly. 🇺🇸🇺🇸👍
I have to dislike this video because of the spoiler in the title
Spoiler alert……. Why
Yes very sensational. Just wow. Very exciting. Beautiful young people that should be winning for awhile. The other teams were not slow in fact very fast also that made the win that more dramatic. No one seemed to be gaining and boom! What a dominant finish. But of course that was with jist barely adequate technique of passing. So wow how they could even be faster. Great stuff and inspiring too see them onward
Italy 👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀
Noah Lyles obviously the worlds fastest man in 100, 200 and relay anchors. All that speed is going to his head though. I thought he was gonna tell that reporter at the end I'm the son of Zeus!
For some reason I’m more impressed with Italy
coleman hits that speed boost bottom off the gun
The biggest shock was Italy blowing by Jamaica on the final leg. That was impressive. Dude was flying.
Bye Jamaica USA is back
More impressive was Japan who appeared to be in second place before that anchor leg...wow! Great job Japan!
this noah just became a multi-millionaire>
These commentators are outstanding.
What’s with the guys and their braids???🤔🤔it just looks silly!!
Proud of USA, but Italy beating Jamaica is pretty impressive as well.
When those hand offs get right USA is gonna be fast af
who are the analysts, i know one is a speedster in track>>these two know track in and out, well done gentlemen>>
You da one, boo!
Lmao at the icy half hug btwn Lyles & Kerley at the end. Even Shelly & Elaine faked it better than that after winning together 😂😂
Awful exchanges of the baton. What is wrong with these coaches that they can't get this right? High schoolers do a better job than this.
that USA finish was absolutely BLSTERING <3
Who are the announcers?
Noah's response to,"Is this going to be the Olympic in Paris", I'm going to be on it!  Confidence.
It feels like if Noah ever gets challenged he always has that gear that will freaking pull on you lol. Jamaica was right there.  Noah like nope not today buddy.
Prayers in Jesus name amen all glory thanks love to God he loves you so much
Noah is Americas Bolt
🇺🇸🥇🇺🇸
I'm just watching cause there's a guy named "Oblique Seville" on the track for Jamaica. That alone was worth the price of admission.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Wow USA y'all gotta practice that baton hand off. It was not good.
Go go USA go 🦅 🦅 🦅 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸
🎉🎉🎉 Let's Go USA💯🎉😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢🎉🇷🇪😢🇺🇲
Needed Knighton on the 3rd leg...not that no-name loser.
Man that Italian guy is super fast he nearly caught and beat the American
ITALIA BABY 🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
Noah looked like he was about to kick into another gear just before he crossed the finish line. He’s scary fast!
still cant beat bolt
Big up Jamaica boys n girls ,both ran well
Best line: I'mma be on it...
Slow times lol
USA and batons....not a good match, historically and even today....
I had to rewatch the race! Who is that last leg runner for Italy?! Sheesh!!!
"Imma be on it"😭🤣☠️ -Noah Lyles-
Lyles is gonna be smashing world records in the next couple years if he stays healthy.
Italy's handoffs were perfect! Wow!
I glad the USA came out Victorious so this was an eye-opener on Jamaica to step their pace up
Big up team USA ,congratulations
Italy was like "what we came in second " ❤❤❤❤❤❤I'm loving that energy 🎉🎉🎉
*Legendary!*
Way to go team USA!! 👏🏾👏🏾. I’m so happy for hometown Brandon Carnes. I know his parents are beaming. 🎊🎉
Big up team  Jamaica we love you all the way. Win loose  or draw you make us proud. You didn't  stop half way you cross that finish  line.  Live life with love and laughter  even when  you fail to accomplish  a set goal.  Laugh it off,  labor and come back stronger.
Italy has a dangerous team. Thank God Noah was the anchor for Team USA because that Italian team could have easily won
Noah killed it! Yes USA!!
That’s how we make America great again lol 💪🏾
Team USA, we built different, congrats to all of our men and women 💪🏾
Get tht Wrk......
Italy was impressive  surprisingly. If we did not have Noah Lyles on that last leg  Italy would have shocked everyone and won gold .But thank God USA got Noah Lyles  !
USA
Noah..Noah..Noah..Noah......yeah!🎉🇺🇸🇺🇸
This is what makes America great. Congrats to USA team!
Congratulations my USA 🇺🇸! Was that Italy 🇮🇹 second though ! Wow .. they are no joke either wow !!!
Wow, Italy was right there. Jamaica is about to transition across all their athletes and may be irrelevant for a bit…except Jackson and Thompson
Noah Lyles has  amazing acceleration like Usain Bolt had .Lyles is unstoppable  !
Team USA men's are beasts
Italy beat Jamaica that’s a win in my book that’s a big step to me lol
We all wonder why the Canadians aren’t there🤔
I hate to be the negative Nancy, but what is so hard about a hand-off that we can't get this right on the men's or women's side? Everybody needs to figure out the appropriate height to lift their arm and stop fishing for the baton. The men's second and third legs also need to adjust their tape as to when they'll start running. Sloppy!
Last pass almost flied to the ground
Noah Lyles is a beast with his acceleration game. Monsta!!
Can we see an all White team win something please....SIKE!!! 😂😂😂😂
Happy they won. But team USA needs to practice on the baton passing. Pls get it right for the Olympic.
Congratulations USA✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 Congratulations Italy 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Man, Noah is something special!!!!
Both relay teams really gotta clean up their passes but they got the baton around and there’s no match for either one of anchors.  Congrats Team USA 🔥🔥🔥
Noah is beyond confident. This is world championships; your talent counts: Confident!
Anyone know the splits?
7:52...."Alright"...Ha...Perfect.❤
Congratulations USA men 🎉🎉🎉
Christian Coleman is fionnnneeee 🤤. Lord I’ve seen what you’ve done for others 0:11
Dominance 💪🏽🇺🇸
Remember they dropped the baton 😂😂 they still suck at passing. They gotta get that together
🔥 🇺🇸
Japan wants to win so bad ...their anchor was fighting for his life  lol
Almost all of them had bad handoffs.  Just think if every leg had smooth handoffs.  Might be a world record.  Who knows.
The team didnt even seem excited afterwards..except the guy that finished it. Weird.
This is the only time white America roots for black people collectively.
That boy Lyles been burning them tracks up 🔥🔥🔥
Lyles is a monster!
No one can stop USA right now woman or men’s at 4x100!!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
that anchor leg for Italy was impressive
He a beast
Italy anchor was smoking some jamaicans
Men and women won their 9th 🇺🇸🥇
Jamaican men have been a disappointment since Usain Bolt era
Lyles is such a monster.
Wow what a last leg!
No surprise, Afros are the best athletes in the world
🎉congratulations gentlemen! You did the U.S. proud.
USA dream team...with the fastest athlete doing 9.83.. thats a joke! These athletes times just show how fast Bolt and the Jamaicans were!  "Dream team"- laughable!  I am sure Gatlin and Tyson Gaye would object to such characterization.
Coleman and Lyles are beasts! Coleman is perfect for that first leg. His start is the fastest Ive seen in years! Awesome job by the mens 4x100 team!
USA ...USA...USA,...🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸, I am so proud of you.....💪💪💪💪
Salute to these Brothaz for leaving the World in their dust!!!💪🏿🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥✊🏿🇺🇸Noah Lyles ✊🏿!!! Let's GO!
Noah with that “imma be on it” when asked if that was the team😂😂😂😂
Noah got Nitrous in his veins... no one is catching him on a straight away.
Four dead even beginning the final stretch and Lyles just smokes the other 3
Noah Lyles is the greatest sprinter in history. No one comes close to his greatness.
Respect to that last leg for Italy lol.. buddy hawked everybody but lyles
Suspect passes for sure 😮 Awful
Yesssss Sir! Let’s go USA❤
8:15  "Pop it off..." Does this have a crude meaning...? At least three of these four guys seem to think so, here...
Wow… every handoff was horrible and USA still came thru… AMAZING!!! Congratulations 🎉
Japan had 2 bad handoffs, Italia anchor was strong
GOD HAVE BLESS AFRICA AMERICA YOUNG LADIES AND GENTLEMEN  🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
The only think more shocking than usa getting the baton around the track is Japan having a fluke in their last handoff
Noah Lyles let's go! USA track will be in great hands for a while.
Next Olympics will be spectacular!
I really be wanting to not know who won until i see the race. Just put 4x1 relay
Im so proud of our track stars 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 we are ready for Paris 2024 🥇🇺🇸
What is Lyles’ top speed? He’s got to be close to Bolt !!
🎉
Those hand off’s are butt clinchers for real. Good Job USA 🇺🇸
Italy should be pumped. That dude smoked everyone except Noah.
Where’s the young boy
🎉
🔥🇺🇸🏅🏆
This will go down as one of my favorite relay teams to be assemebled. To be anchored by Lyles is just legendary. Well done guys! 🇺🇸
"no more my bads"  said to his team mate!  (I believe he was trying to just reassure his confidence) ......handoff
3 lame handoffs & still can't be beaten......wow!
where is Knighton!!
“Suspect passes” had me 💀💀💀 but y’all did great though! You guys were flying!!! 👏🏼👏🏼🔥🔥
😂italy burnt that jamaican dude. 😳... who put him on anchor?
Italy 😳
10:03 “I know I’m on it” Awkward pause* 😂😂😂😂
GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 let’s goooo guys! Just killin it per usual. Congratulations 🎊
Give it up for the USA team, they knocked it out of the park!  Italy came in a strong second with Tortu again!   Great anchors on both the top two teams.
Japan looks like they have a more efficient method of handing off the baton.
Didn’t know Pharrell was running for Japan at 7:08
The Lady's did pretty, The Men did it strong.
BEST MF COUNTRY!
While the women soccer team won’t even wear the flag
Ommmmmmg , Japan needs to fire their coach ASAP,  what kind of exchange were those...
Foundational Black American men - REPRESENT!
❤❤
for a moment there I thought Noah had jumped onto a motorbike idling by the tracks! wtf!
He was booking baby! 😂
Congratulations Team USA !
"Nothing you wanna show as a baton pass" took me out😅😂😂
Dayum, I've been a fan of Noah Lyles for years, but this year he's something else!  😃
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉yaaaasssss!!!!
🙌🏽❤️🇺🇸
USA finally back to our rightful place  in sprints and relays!
Well with the last 3 winners of the 100m you had to expect them to do well.
Love watching the USA teams run.  They are amazing!
"I'ma be on IT" 😂😂😂😂
Awful handoff at the end but Lyles is different
Congrats!
Kerley got size
WTG Fellas on to Paris.
They get those handoff on point and US would drop at least another second
👏🏾 👏🏾 👏🏾
Awesome, flawless run! Congratulations!
Noah lyles has figured it out dude is so comfortable and at this point it’s too easy
Lol imagine if African Americans had to representing an African country. No medals in track and field 😂
Noha be clubbin' 🔥🔥
why is noone talking about diversity in sports, its dominated by black people
Why is the US men’s team allergic to good handoffs 😭
💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾🇺🇸❤️
It was Carl Lewis then Usain Bolt but the Noah Lyles era is now here!  Paris will be a blast!  Track & Field, like Boxing is Baaaaaaaaak!
Three gold medals for Noah Lyles - breathtaking sprinting performance in these championships!
Terrible passes surprised lyles didn’t drop it
That was great!
Lyles was practically running on air
Afterburners
I love watching USA when good job team
Wee'rree bAaaackkk!!! 🇺🇸💪🏾 🇺🇸 ✊🏾🇺🇸♥️
Terrible handoffs but didn't even matter
I love watching my fellow west Alkebulan brothers and sisters dominate the track.
Italy knows how big a deal it is just to beat Jamaica gotta love it 😂
Congrats to USA mens team.🎉 You guys made American proud again! 🇺🇸👏🏽👍🏽🍻✌🏽
Congratulations to team Jamaica 🇯🇲.We are very proud of You guys.
*Sensational* - Future 😂😭
Congrats ❤
USA is ready for the Olympics in Paris 2024! Bring it!
Lyles speed is insane!!!
❤❤❤❤❤USA
🤠💯💯💯💯
The ladies had a terrible last pass.  Lyles had a fantastic pass.  That's how to do it
Yes 🙌🏽 ❤
We're back world.
Solid 💰
We need a coach just for baton pass… geesh 🇺🇸
Usan bolt was fast
I mean Italy though
USA 🇺🇸 YESSSS lets GO!! JAMAICA 🇯🇲 always LOVE your talent, but Italy 🇮🇹 Silver💨... way to Compete! Loving the WORLDS 🌎 🥇
Beautiful! Love to see America on top once more.
Chadwick wakanda forever
❤❤❤❤❤
The batoning is atrocious. The speed is outstanding.
Lucky to have won. Those baton transfers were horrendous!
Carnes held his own
Jamaica Need To Find A Better Anchor Leg ASAP Bcuz They Should Have Won Silver. Everybody  Passed Him Especially Italy. Seville Should Have Anchored. Nobody Can Pass Him. The Only Team Would Be USA.
Lyles is simply amazing my goodness that acceleration 🙏🙌
Congratulations 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
🔺shout-out to our Nubian gods setting the track on 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
We got the last THREE World Champions on tis team but WHO IS BRANDON CARNES?? Where is Erriyon????? We won't get that WR til Erriyon is in this.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉congratulations Team USA
Awesome
Italy second and all whites. Well Jacobs 50/50. Unbelievable.
First off, yay! USA!!!!   But....wow, way to go ITALY!!!!!!! That last leg was insane 🔥
Love it!!! ❤🙌🏽
Let’s go team USA 🇺🇸 !!!
Please stop spoiling the results in your video titles!!!!
Stellar race!
🇺🇸🇺🇸🔥🔥🥇🥇🥇
Wow... Italy 🇮🇹 represented  👏 *USA though 🤷
Lyles kinda looks like pop smoke 💫🕊️ respectfully congratulations team USA 🇺🇸
Noah flipped on that NOS switch like VROOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
This is One of The Greatest Dream Teams the United States has Ever sent to the world championship ! I am Soooo Proud of These Athletes who have made us one proud Nation !!!...
what a race
Am Jamaican but Lyes is the new Bolt lol ❤ him
Japan had a surprisingly good race, especially being in the outside lane. If that last pass wasn’t so horrendous they might have had a chance to place on the podium. Good race
Italy Beating The Jamaicans For Second Place Isn't A Upset Bcuz They Did It Last Year. There 100m Relay Team Is Second In The World Behind The USA Bigg Facts!!!
Noah and Sha’Carri accelerate like no other. It’s simply astounding 🎉
This just in:  NASA has contracted with Noah Lyles to serve as a booster rocket.
Despite the sub-par passes, I am glad the guys got the gold. Noah Lyles is a beast. 🇺🇲🇺🇲 USA USA USA 🇺🇲🇺🇲
We Coming!!!!!
First woth those bad exchanges??? Man the world is in trouble come the olympics... we will have these cleaned up and a new record in the books!  -N
Lyles *destroyed them* to close that out...
Umm the Italians were more Happy than the Americans 😂
Italy beat Jamaican they got slow down on the oxtail rude boy🤷🏽‍♂️
Race starts at 4:00 in case anyone wants to skip all the talking 🙃
look at the joy and excitement of the Italian runner earning Silver - that's my favorite part of Worlds & the Olympics.
Congrats team USA
Wtf??!?! Noah Lyles was AMAZING!!
Japan had #2 until that last transfer.
US track is back!
🇺🇸
The Jamaicans  Makes Track And Field So Fun To Watch Again Bcuz They Always Give Team USA 🇺🇸 Fight!!! I Have So Much Respect For The Jamaicans!!! 💯
Total domination
Jamaican men are down bad. I'm not understanding why they haven't been able to reload since Bolt retired. The women have been consistent
Even the Maga's have to love this, Both Men and Women handled their buiness.   Guess we need the Brothers and sisters after All!  Too Soon??
Alright no shade but this competition got me thinking Lyles might be juicing😂
Imagine a mixed gender relay with shacarri and lyles on the same team 😭🔥
Sensational!!
Love Noah ❤Lyles...Gold written all over him!!!!!
Go America !!!
Italy felt they won gold with their silver.
Yasssssss💃💃🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Reporter: Is this the team for Paris right here, the foursome? Noah: I'm gonna be on it! 😂
🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸
Come on Noah act like you been there dude, don’t be a show off. Ever heard of being humble?
✊🏾🇺🇸 let's go!
Nobody cares
Speeeeeeed….. Noah Gold!
Ok this is the deal everyone the US relays teams are put together sort of last minute, so they don't train together a lot thus the sloppy baton passing.
Poor handoffs USA good win tho
Noah is already a legend but Geesh he is just writing his name in the history books with a permanent marker at this point!
🦚NBC Sports should zoom in on the 2nd leg. also, the camera angle replay on the 3rd exchange doesn't reveal much😏
I LOVE USA 🇺🇸 ❤
Lyles has Great top end speed.  Did you see him just walk?
Grande Italia 🇮🇹!
We bike, baby!
How does Noah accelerate like that!!!!!!!!!! The last time meters he always just rapidly increases! AMAZING!! 🇺🇸congratulations fellas!!!
The baton handoffs by the USA team were nerve racking to watch.
🎉 Go USA ❤🇺🇸
USA men need to learn how to correctly hand off batons cleanly...a couple of hand-offs were a bit suspect, but none-the-less a job well done. congrats!
🇯🇵 seeking that first podium👀
Great race for the USA, but gotta get the baton pass together for Paris. USA! 🇺🇸 💪🏾
Can anyone please tell me what happened to the 4 x 2 relay? Why was it just taken out?
🇺🇲  > 🇯🇲
Beautiful run by Italy.. very impressive!
Go USA🎉
it will be interesting to see if Lyles can ever break any of bolts world records in the 100 and 200 which seem almost unbreakable.
That last Italian was moving like a 🚀🚀
Lyles like a road runner
LETS GO U.S.A 🎉🎉🎉
Why not Knighton on third leg? Especially since he is a great turn runner. Just wondering!! But great job!!
oh my god baton trouble for usa everywhere 🤣 so glad they had good outcomes tho
FBA🇺🇸✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿
🤦🏾‍♂️handoffs 🇺🇸 😢
So Happy Too See Fred Kerley Leave With A Gold Medal 🥉💯
USA sets a world record if they didnt butcher every hand off LOL
American propaganda
🇺🇸
💯
Lyles is tough… strides are amazing
So happy for Italy.  They were overcome with joy.
This is great congratulations. Men and women it’s been a great worlds.
The 3rd leg is the most replaceable, but if I had to put anyone on that 3rd leg in the 4 x 100, it's between Kung Fu Kenny, Erriyon Knighton, or most of all Michael Norman (He had said in the past, he had felt the need for speed, and the only way to put that to practice is to train in the relays)!
Just stay Healthy TeamUSA..We'll get that Gold 🥇 in Paris 2024 Olympics
USA hand offs were trash! But boy are they fast...
They were ultra conservative on them handoffs. But lyles legit looked insane in that pull away.
👑👑👑👑🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Congratulations  Kings 🤎
Bro they need to have erryion knighton on 3rd leg knighton to lyles would be destruction
Michael johnson has something to say about this, I remember watching the Olympics in Florida on one of those big round tvs
I feel bad for Zarnel Hughes..he was having a good Worlds...I feel like Seville should have anchor Jamaica,  but what do I know 😂😂
Imagine the time once they perfect the handoffs!
❤❤❤❤
You can tell Kerley was still salty in that interview lmao
In case anyone forgot USA is the best 😮
The way Noah walked them down!! Team USA domination!
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
USA baton passes are more suspect than USA presidential elections!  With that said, Noah is the King.
Would be so fun to see Lyles break Bolt's world records in 2024.
Coleman🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man i love track and field...lets go U.S
Not only is Noah dominant Noah is a leader!!! And I like this group right here they have some chemistry.
Where is Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake for GB? I love him to see him run. Team USA had three world champions on one team. STACKED even with bad handoffs. I’m so proud of Team USA!
Japan handoff to last leg was bad...they probably could of medal 🤔🤷🏽‍♀️ && what happened with Canada 🇨🇦??!🤔 why wasn't they there?  So many Questions. Proud of USA 🇺🇸 SPRINTERS
italy beating Jamaica, Bolt is shaking his head
Thank goodness we didn’t screw this up
Gotta feel bad for Simbine just standing there at the anchor spot not getting a chance to compete.
They did well beating Jamai-ker.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
NL is king, dude glides like a dam gazelle! No one can catch him, it’s simply over.  Congrats team USA men and women 🇺🇸
Noahhhhh🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Well done!
Marvin Bracy or Trayvon Bromell at 3rd leg will have a chance of breaking the U.S. Record
I think they need another style of baton pass...that one seemed awkward.
Yassss!!! Congratulations gentlemen!!! 🇺🇸🥇🏆👏🏾🙌🏾✊🏾❤
Ayo Japans last leg was moving!!,
7:05 You can notice in their faces who looks more confident approaching the finish line.
Congratulations 🎊 TEAMUSA  ON WINNING GOLD 🥇  I KNEW Y'ALL COULD DO IT...GREAT JOB MEN 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Coleman runs like he's mad at the ground- I love it!!!!
This was a clinic on HOW NOT TO PASS BATONS and getting really close to drop them.
Lmao @ Jamaica. NO BOLT! NO HOPE! 😂 LOL
❤🇺🇸🏃🏿‍♂️🔥🔥🔥
Finally something to ve proud of 🇺🇸 Italy did their thing too 🔥
"The final 4??!"  Nah, don't sleep on Trayvon Brommell like that!! And don't forget about Kung-fu Kenny!! It ain't over yet!! 🔥
BIGGGG 3️⃣
Perhaps TeamUSA needs to spend 90% of their Paris2024 training on baton handoffs? Two bad handoffs in a race like 4x100m is atrocious. If it wasn't for their individual qualities. Phew!
Is the weakness always baton passing for the US?
Has it gotten too easy for Lyles?
Team USA all the wayyyy🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Japan and Italy pass right hand low (passing runner) to inside left hand down (receiving runner) on pass 1, left hand low to right hand down pass 2 and right hand low to left hand down, pass 3. The U.S passes same right to left to right but high and mostly palms up. This seems inherently more likely to create sloppy passes, more attuned to completing the pass rather than passing efficiently. Probably the result of limited practice, relying on talent rather than effectiveness.
Gone USA. We back!!!
38 seconds 🤯
These talented athletes trained so hard to make the finals and emerged victorious *
Team USA was incredible. Noah is that dude. I was surprised at Italy being next up. They did great.
To bad Noah can't catch a football like Jerry Rice
Way to go USA! God bless you all.
6:03 them Italians some freaks 😂
The titles to all these videos, have been so fried imao
Amazing, wonderful job guys!!! 👏🏾👏🏾❤️❤️🔥🔥
Congratulations 🇺🇸💥
Missed it live dammit
You fix those handoffs and that's a WR right there
"No matter if you win by an inch or a mile. Winning is winning." Toretto... Noah - ok, so I win by a mile then. 😂
My guy said since Usain Bolt dissapeared sheeeeesh👀
They need Bracy on 3rd leg!
Jamaica wtf I thought they banned track and field in jamaica after Usain bolt
Congratulations 🥇🏆💯💪🏾
Well done, Team USA!
Use this as a “Get Knighton on the 3rd leg” button
The US can go faster.
Usa has never had good transitions with the baton such a cringe win
Awesome!
With all respect,, they placed a 10.09 100m sprinter over knighton... That is crazy.. that's weird....
I wasn't familiar with Noah Lyles until these events.  I like his charisma! Shouts to the entire 4x100 team.  ✊🏾
If these two are t commentating do we even wanna watch. Great jobs guys you guys are synonymous with great sprinting. 👍🏿
Lyles is amazing bro.. smh ..
These handoffs were just nerve racking
USA did not come to play today🎉❤Noah is special
That top End Speed is no joke.
"Good news sir, the baton was passed poorly." "Good news?" "Yes, sir. The baton was still passed to Noah Lyles".
iMUA USA!🤙
Shocked at Italy 👀👀👀
They better start worrying abt italy cuz what!
Italia and Japan very impressive
Knighton def should’ve been 2nd or 3rd leg but great run!!
I thought Italy won for a second based on the celebration of 2nd place …Noah lookin at him like…why you running further than me after the finish line😂 4:40
Italy knows they won the i dont care olympics
Noah is crazily fast.
What did they say Noah?
Notice it’s the Black Americans that bring the gold to the United States 🇺🇸
What happened to S. Africa??🤷🏾‍♀️
Somebody tell Great Britain to quit pouting and walk it off 😂 🇺🇸
That last leg for Italy 👀 brodie was gliding
Brasil
The USA team coach should be reprimanded for allowing such clumsy, awkward baton passes to occur on his watch. Has he ever taught them how to do it? Or drilled it into their muscle memory? Apparently not.
Italians celebrating like they won the 🥇 😂
Congrats USA! Italy Looked Great Too!
Congratulations🎉🎉🎉
Japan's last baton pass wasn't good. They were right there
Japan had me shook for a sec
Imagine being the fastest man in the world ❕ Amazing. Great to see the 🇺🇸 back on top in the greatest track and field event ever created ❕
At thus level the handoffs should not be so terrible.
Hats off to Italy too! They shocked themselves!!
Girls handoffs were bad... They didn't get to practice allot..
What it must feel like to be able to run that fast….
Way to go usa
Congratulations Team USA! Noah’s top end speed is ridiculous! Coleman start is ridiculous! You need them two as 1&4 all the time!!! All the men did well even though their hand offs were suspect! 😬😂Congratulations nonetheless!!!
Absolutely awesome performance! That final leg was epic across the board!
Congrats Noah! Bozos were giving all the glory to Knight and Tebogo. Give praise to winners…not potential.
Fue chistoso verte hoy empingao al final de ttt (oscluis)
Mannn they don’t practice exchanges at all 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️💀. Still got gold tho! 🔥💯
Noah gave a beautiful finish the cherry on top🤗🙌🏾❤️!!!!!!!!
Congratulations guys 🇺🇸
🔥🔥💯
That was some fast Italians and the 3rd leg Japanese runner screwed up the baton exchange and cost them a medal.  That Japanese anchor was flying.
Lol maaaann that Italian was stepping 😅😅
9:15 Japanese guy looks goofy asl😂
Wow!! That is fast
🇺🇸 baby! Also, I am happy for 🇮🇹. Tortu did great on anchor
Yesssssssss USA women and men both killed it love to see it🥹🙌🏾❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️!!!!!!
Italy 🇮🇹 gotta chill lmfao 😮
Italy's 3rd and anchor was crucial!!!
Congratulations USA! And shoutout to Italy, anchor leg was coming down hard!!
Congratulations to the ENTIRE USA team!!! One word for Noah Lyles - Him. He’s that guy that someone should write about. 💪
Congratulations to the U.S. team! They have the best talent, thank goodness. But why, good god why, can they cannot pass the baton anyway near other countries, especially Italy & Japan. This weakness has been going on for a half century. Imagine what they could run if their passes were even adequate. They'd be down to 36.50. Please U.S. coaches, hire someone who can teach this.
Gotta get the baton hand-offs situated but they were good and domiinant enough to still get the gold 🥇🇺🇲
The Women won Gold, and they also had a couple sloppy exchanges. Without those, what kind of times could our teams have put up?
NOAH LYLES ACCELERATION IS GOD TIER.
Bolt is the fastest man
Lyles won that race. Top 4 teams all got the baton to the final leg very close together. Then Lyles PULLED AWAY down the straight!! 🔥
I guess France is trying to destroy Africa and win the Olympics
Congratulations team USA!!! And look at Italy snatching the silver 😊❤❤❤
Noah is too insanely fast!
Imma Be On It 😂😂😂
The whole Italy team looked nervous asf
Fabulous
As fast as they are, Just imagine, the world record is 36.84
Team USA has such talented great athletes on our teams. Sooo excited for the Olympics in Paris. The men and the women delivered and made history
🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸  🇮🇹 🇮🇹 so nice to see them so excited 🇯🇲
USA USA USA USA USA USA .........cant mess with the boogie speed
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Man, those Italians were not playing around. I sure expected Jamaica to get the silver. GO U.S.A.!!!
Lyles hit the AFTERBURNER
Japans anchor was a beast
Show us the Olympic gold. Not this.
USA absolutely dominated the short distance races men’s and women’s
Congrats.  Fellas❤❤❤
USA baby..🇺🇸🥇..
huge event yet so many empty seats...  let the real folks in...
Very exciting!
gotta give it to italy for beating jamica. they got some serious horsepower
Is this the team?   Noah - ima be on it 😂
That last pass was an 8.7. It's what won the race 💪🏼❤️🇺🇸
"Imma be on it".... Legend
Closest thing to Bolt
Am I the only one that click fast af so I don’t read the title? 😭
It is nice to see Italy continue to do well. Why can't the baton passes be better for USA? It would be nice to see.
🎉Congratulations  Team USA. And our Gainesville Fl Noah. Great job😊
Israelites are amazing 🏃🏿✊🏿👏🏿
Ato Bolden 🤷‍♂️🤦
Bro the camera man can atleast show who else was in the race I'm sure the athletes would like to see that in the future...and also the commentator can also talk about the other teams in the race...it's boring just talking about 1 team ....I'm sure yall focusing on the usa but guess what ? If you say something great about another team we will realize all that greatness and the usa still manage to come out on top ....stop the bias commentary it's for the entire tournament it's happening...completely out of context but let's say lyles got to 112 years old and there was a documentary on him and there was only 1 other person still alive and it was one of the south Africa runner...we couldn't even prove it the real way because yall didn't even show anyone else in d race .....come on mon
FBA🇺🇸
Lights Out Boys ⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️
👏🏽👏🏽
Woah, my men’s Jamaican team looks slow this year.
Why is Canada not defending their title?
Kings Disease! And I love it! Especially when y'all do it in public and I'm the subject cause ya'll my !!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Think about what would happen if they worked on the timing of the passes.
Wow!
Is that the same anchor leg runner for Italy that did an incredible anchor in the Olympics ?
Congratulations to Lyles, he put on a clinic in these world championships!! Gold in 100m, 200m, and then the 100m relays. He just incredible
U.S.A.  U.S.A.  U.S.A.
They did this with 2 bad hand offs.
Lyles handoff was good because they did it at a high velocity.
Lyle has adopted the like of cheetah style, using back column to catapult his momentum, not just his legs and arms. Usain excelled on it though he had bad upper efficiency.  It never fails!!
Lyles is a beast...
No Jamaican flags?? Just checking!!😅
CONGRATULATIONS USA's 100×4 MENS ⚡️ ⭐️ 🌌  BIRTHDAY🥳 🎉 🎈 🎁 🎊
I love track N field......great 🏃
You mean to tell me the only person the US could find to put on a 3rd leg is someone who hasn’t ran under 10 seconds in the 100m? I always wonder about these coaches…
Congratulations Guys🏆🏆🏆🏆
Wow the Men’s and the Women’s race had multiple bad baton exchanges and still won. I wonder what their times would’ve looked like if they both had perfect exchanges…..
Congratulations Team, I’m so proud of them, Team Italy was moving
Race starts at 3:45
The first and fourth legs were on fire. I don't know what the times were but they clearly outperformed on those two legs. Awesome job!!  Proud of an American team that doesn't include Megan rapino
Who knew Italian people were so fast!
FBA USA 🇺🇲 FBA USA 🇺🇲 FBA USA 🇺🇲
Let’s hope the 🥇 sticks!! 💉 💉 💉 💉
CONGRATS TO NOAHAND THE USA, BUT I WISH US JAMAICANS PASSED THE BATON A BIT BETTER BUT GOOD JIB REGARDLESS!
Jamaica leaving Tracey off the relay team cost them a silver or a gold.
💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
USA 🇺🇸,  Congratulations 🎊.
Sensational.
These boys lit!!!
congrats to them! Coleman's a beast, that start was crazy
Japan Anchor was closing in but too much of a distance to recover Congratulations to Team USA
Why does have evergone have crap handoffs? Lol   Its not like they dont have a track where they practice! Goodness gracious - our high school teams have better handoffs 😅
Wow! I think I Saw flames on that track!!
jamaica aint the ame without bolt and blake
Us still the best un the effen world bye
Noah hit that nos boost button
That Italian put on the nitro
Wow
Combos PS4
Congratulations boys🎉 Made us proud 🇺🇸
I really don’t get it !! I ran 100 yard and 4X100 back in the day for PAL. The Patton pass AINT THAT FREAKING HARD. Do what you practice!!
Jamaica should have won silver. Watson got smoked by the Italian. Props to Italy.
USA 🇺🇸 USA 🇺🇸 USA 🇺🇸
Sad day when Jamaica gets beat Italy 😂
They won easily but that wasn't a good race at all .. really bad passes on the last 3 legs.  Could have lower the time much more.
I have a problem with that, Knighton should have been on that Squad.
Italy guy was east too 🎉
Commentator … Is this the team for Paris ? Noah Lyles  … I know I’m on it !! Lol 😂
Incredible
Italy celebrating like they actually did something. Those sissy boys just got smoked by the USA! This is America!!!
🎉❤
Pole vault is much more impressive tho lol
He should transition so he can become champ,champ.
Japan and Jamaica got their hopes up with the USA last leg in the semis...Lyles brought em back to reality
How About The USA 4 By 100 Relay Champs Congratulation🇺🇲💯
Italy beat Jamaica, mon. 🤣
Is this Noah's first triple gold?  If so that's amazing, I hope to see more.
Italy won the non-black gold medal.
Wtf Italy beat Jamaica? I wasn't expecting that lol.
Team USA 🇺🇸!!! Congrats! Man, Noah Lyles turned on the NOS.
USA still can’t do baton pass?
❤ congratulation’s USA men’s was ready
✊🏿💪🏿
I don’t know why the US team has always been struggling with baton passing. There time should have been a bit better if the passing was perfect. Congrats to the US team anyway.🇺🇸💪❤️
Congrats! Don’t sleep on Sha'Carri Richardson as a break out star! We know Lyles is the best in the world! There is no doubt but who saw Sha'Carri Richardson coming! Men and women did it!
italy was so happy with silver. That tells you how fast USA is and how dominant USA/Jamaica are at sprinting. I know Italy is defending Olympic champs, but that was a total surprise. Hot dang, Team USA smoked it!
Shout out to Italy, The Anchor did REALLY well.
Noah's acceleration 😮
Third leg should've been Grant Holloway.
SENSATIONAL 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
🫶🫶🫶 congratulations Team USA 🎉
A bit disappointed Lyles' first reaction after anchoring a "team" race he holds up three fingers to highlight his three golds.  At least enjoy the team win for a few seconds first.  There's plenty of time to bask in the glory of his three golds, which is no doubt quite an accomplishment.
Handoffs were bad but they got the gold.
Imagine how much better the American sprinters would be if they had any idea of how to make a good stick pass? This has been an epidemic for our sprinters for way too long.
where was lyles when bolt was running 🤧😂
Lyles top end speed is insane. Coupled with his exceptional form and blistering fast arm speed/ leg stride rotation. An absolute pleasure to watch!
Congratulations ,USA🔥
CONGRATS USA...💯 NGL but to have made those many  bad passes and still hold off everyone, puts more RESPECT on this win.
CONGRATULATIONS TEAM USA!! Well done guys!
man it constantly blows me away how these other countries can have like one elite runner and yet always do well in the 4x1. canada comes out of nowhere to win last year and don't even make the finals this year. GB won in 2017 despite not having a single 100m finalist on the team. italy wins the 21 olympics even though they only had 1 runner in the finals. and it's not like they're running slow times either - all these results are top 25 all time.
1 day the 🌎 will learn who the chosen and gifted are. Even through captivity and affliction, still We RISE and SHINE!
Yes, Lyles must run anchor and Coleman has that monster start.  Fabulous.
Lyles was UNREAL.
It’s like Noah shifts into another gear is just different. Congrats USA.
🙌🏾
Good race. But I was super impressed with Italy's 4th leg that dude was moving.
Noah lyles made 220k at this world champs in prize money
Lyles completing the Bolt triple is a wonder to behold
If they get their handoffs correct before the olympics I see an OR happening with Noah Lyles as the anchor. Crazy fast!
Absolutely proud of my Team USA!!!
Noah doesn't get run down ever. He runs people down.
Black Excellence 🙏🏾
Way to go Team USA!!
Coleman is insane
WE NEED A 4x100 mixed as well
Coleman's  first leg was a thing of blistering beauty!
GO USA!!! #1.  Proud of both teams.
great running all around by Team USA, but every relay had bad baton exchanges and all the exchanges of this race lacked basic relay training that even I knew when I ran in high school. Look at team Japan's handoffs in slow-mo for excellent handoffs!
My favorite track event.
Italy came in second...beating Jamaica. Where is Italy getting all of it's speed to push the U.S.?  Amazing Race!!!
Wow. Italy was crushing it, But we got Noah, that's all I can say.
If he’s even, he’s leavin
IMA BE ON IT!!!😬😂😂
Three 100m Gold Medalists helped Noah get his third Gold Medal!! Go USA!! THANKS FOR CREDITING ME ATO!
Noah Lyles uses the best adjectives 😂😂
America Strong but may my lord continue to bless us all.
That was pure overpowerment of talent.
Erriyon Knighton should have been 3rd leg‼️TF they thinking about?
If you give Noah the baton and he's ahead your chances have reduced to none. This is the fastest man in the world and with a headstart your done for. Go USA!! Our men showed up and showed out. We got this Jamaica!! Love y'all but Bolt ain't here to save you!😂😂
This race was so quick I missed the third exchange!
Great Job Guy's.. Go USA!!! 🇺🇸😎
GANG
USAAAAA!!! cleaned up at worlds. congrats to everyone involved
Japan gets a medal with a better laying draw and door handle between third and fourth guy,,, Japan is very close and soon they're going to get that metal.,, If they can stay consistent they'll get that metal sooner or later
Great race and good job united states
You know lyles was thinking 3. 3 3 3 3 his entire run.
❤️‍🔥🏆Men & Women USA Represent-in' the 4×100m in Budapest Worlds 2023🎉❤️‍🔥
Lyles top speed is insane
American Exceptionalism
with good handoffs they would have killed the record
Let’s not hear anymore Jamaica this and Jamaica that talk for a while eeeeh!!
Compare these hand offs to the women's handoffs.  Total night and day.  The women's usa team were running up on each other.
I love being black ✊🏼
Look at how much ground Sani Brown for Japan made up on that anchor. Insane.
Let's go team 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸
When you got that kinda speed, a few bad passes wont kill you. But they have to clean that up.
Boy the Jamaican team Sure don't look like the muscled up teams with Bolt Hmmmmm😉
#1
Once Noah gets into his steps ... he gone.
It looks like the #1 spot isn’t Jamaica’s anymore.
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💨💨💨
God bless THE USA 🇺🇸 🇺🇸
Those hand offs made my high school 4x100 look like an Olympic team. Ours were actually clean tho 😅
🇺🇸 🫡
Awesome. USA back on top. Yeah
Why no mention of Cravont Charleston? He's the American National Champion in the 100m. Where is he?
Clean up the baton passes and we’ve got a shot at the world record.
If japan’s last handoff wasn’t messed up😭
Noah and Sha'carri did their thing👏🏿⚡️🇺🇸🖤
US really have problems with baton changes. If the baton exchanges were better, they could break the championship record.
USA had the last three world champions on their team….they shouldn’t be surprised!!!
Congratulations
He will not be bolt
Jamaican men! Come on now!
Great Britain take these losses so hard. They cut up in Olympics when Italy ran them down now they acting up again for not placing third.
Italy had super smooth handoffs! That aided their win for sure that's detail
Poor hand offs for US but our speed was just too much. Congrats to the Italians also.
A sensational event.
THE USA TEAM DID AMAZING!! That anchor leg on Italy did great too. Also S/o to Brandon on 3rd leg for making the necessary adjustment to the baton without dropping it.
Noah freakin Lyles
Not "I'ma be on it!" with the old uncle laugh😂. I can't wait for the Olympics!!
The Italian team is really good.  Dude on the anchor smoked the Jamaican at the end
I honestly don't think I have ever seen a 2nd place team celebrate like they won Gold like that before 😂😂.
Noah Lyles WR for the Seahawks.
coleman is an animal
with the success that jamaica has had I would say that this defeat to jamaica won't go over well
Congratulations to our FBA brotha!
The team is made of Greatness.
those Italians were moving
If you’re even with Noah, you’ve already lost
Noah taking it all
Christian Coleman should ALWAYS BE THE STARTER FOR RELAYS! Dude's the quickest we've got.
Great World Championships for USA 🔥
As a islander like Usain whos my. Favorite..Noah lyles is the only one in track right now,(if he stays healthy) can touch Bolt's records in the future..Respect to Team USA  Men's track team .alot of Talent,i knew they would win evn though i was going for Jamaica.
America lord why we always having hand off issues smh 🤦
USA ofc. If japan had a better last exchange they probably medal, that anchor leg was burning up the track!!
Why is the American record listed at 37.10 (2019) when the usa ran a 37.04 in 2012 Olympics??🤔
Noah got like 3-4 gold medals voy was blacking
This team is hot, Lyles is a beast
That was awesome, smoked it!
I remember racing against Noah Lyles at Highschool invitational meets as Sophomores. He scary back then and he's even scarier now. Good stuff
Lyles has matured nicely, classy celebration compared to previous wins.
It was a great decision to have Coleman lead off
Congratulations 👏 USA men.🏆💪👑
🚦🚦🚦
Awesome job team USA 🇺🇸 👏
Was the Italians celebrating or were they making out?
I’m so happy for this team.
Was not the best hand offs but they got the job done
Team USA, starring Noah Lyles!!!! The other athletes, were the backup and Noah is the LEAD, Singer!! They had, the right man, as the Anchor!! Now, this is a TEAM!!!! We can, look up to!! Congrats!!
USA DOMINATION! ❤️🤍💙🇺🇸
They are so cute ❤
Japan and USA almost dropped the last handoffs, Almost a Disaster for Lyles on that last pass.
Congratulations 🎉🎉🎉👏🏾👏🏾 let's go Y'ALL USA 🇺🇸🇺🇸💪🏽💪🏽🙏🏾🙏🏾
Noah is a stud. Period.  He smoked the last leg.
No Usain Bolt gives US a chance to win Golds!
Even with very sloppy handoffs, this team is going to be very hard to beat in Paris '24! If they clean up the baton passes, look out! Noah Lyles looks unbeatable!
🎉😎
Congrats....glad Fred Kerley got to help in getting gold in the 4x100m. Did Italy beat Jamaica for the silver?😮😬
Fantastic race! But when fractions of a second can affect the outcome, how much better would the results be if the coaches sorted the baton passes?
Noah has a big beautiful smile ❤
I just love the Italian anchor. He’s so good and being underestimated. He anchored and won in the last Olympics.
Yeah, we gotta get ole boy off the 3rd leg. Man he had me nervous
the USA about to be back too dominating track & field
Fantastic job Team USA 4x100 relay team!!  Christian Coleman smoked that 1st leg as always, Fred Kerley put them in 1st, and Noah Lyles murdered that anchor leg with no problems.  Congratulations to Noah Lyles on 3 Gold Medals at Worlds in the 100m, 200m, and 4x100. 🙏🏾👏🏾🔥🔥
He's been all over the headlines. The fruits of his labor are coming to fruition. This guy is inspiring.
these guys make proud to an American. Go USA!!!!
U.s. made passes good enough to keep you worried that they're saying "don't worry, we'll get back to being DQed for the Olympics.". But I'm really impressed with Italy.
FBA King magic!!! 🇺🇸✊🏾💪🏾👑👏🏾💜
The 4x100, men and women for the last twenty years has been about the US and Jamaica  it’s like the other teams are just simply there.
Congrats Team USA!!
“I’ma be on it” 😂😂😂🎉
Lyles is a human rocket right now. But props to Italy’s Tortu who always comes in nig as anchor relays.
Christian Coleman and Noah Lyles getting their gold medal and World Championships in Men's 4x100m Relay.
Wow that was intense! I’m more impressed with Italy and Japan! That was quite surprise to say the least
Lyles out here running like a powered  up DBZ style Sonic 🔥
usa dominate now frfr
Nice job Italy as well !!!!!!!
Did Jamaica just let Italy best them?
🇺🇸 Yes Sir! They got wheels for feet! 🇺🇸 All gas no brakes!🥇
Noah lyles just runnin on another level for himself right now. So exciting to see. Cant wait for Paris. Gonna be fun to watch
JETS 🎉
Proud of Italy🇮🇹🥈
Noah what a stud!
As longs as Coleman fred and bosh are Healthy this is the 4x1 squad with an addition to Knighton powerhouse
Congrats....glad Fred Kerley got to help in getting gold in the 4x100m.
Lyes is fast as heck 🔥 📛.  Shout out to the entire team
Fred said it best.  "That's not how track and field works."
How can the Italians run that fast on all that pasta?
Noah Lyles is just toooooooooo fast. 🥇 CONGRATS TEAM USA MENS 4X100 RELAY!!!
5:10 his teammates just left him there on the ground to cry alone
Usa track is backkkkkkkkk!
no one noticed how badass Italy anchor ran!  i love how he celebrates second by clapping hands with Lyles,  well done USA!
Imagine if they had flawless passes...
Noah Lyles runs like Usain Bolt with that big long stride I like it
Lyles is as in the zone as any sprinter I've ever seen.   How about Italy? Tortu is always a relay beast for them.
Just AMAZING!!!🇺🇸
Italy was in there.
What happened to south africa on the last leg?
I’m glad to see the US take back their dominance in this event. This lineup reminds me of Cason, Burrell, Mitchell & Lewis
I knew Lyles is uncatchable, but Tortu did run a great race.
Noah is cocky. I don't like his answer at the end "well I'm going to be there." Why not encourage your teammates!! He doesn't know he will be in Paris. Tomorrow is not promised!!!
Great job Team USA but Italy needs some recognition as well for their flawless baton exchanges 👏🏼
Everybody hungry. Everybody movin. Got it around.
Sloppy
Japan's last handoff cost them the 2nd place.
Nah Lyles stride is actually insane lol perfect power stride by stride. So smooth. Bolt would be the only one to compete with him if he was still around. Says a lot. He’s on pace for an incredible medal run at Paris
If they had ideal handoffs that's a 36 high right there
Good jobs USA! I see you Italy #2. 🇮🇹
Way to go Italy 🇮🇹
Noah put some space in between
i like how pumped the italians were for the silver pretty impressive
Jamaica sprinting without Usain bolt is just average now😂
was japan''s last baton pass bad?
Noah is a bit proud, but hard to blame him. Incredible performance by him at Worlds and the team here in the relay.
American running both mens and woman's are amazing , im So proud of them💯💪👏👏
USA has a stacked lineup
ThNk goodness we have a reliable us sprinter…i dnt like heart attacks
LETS GO USA
Lyles got the triple crown- 100, 200, 100relay. He probably could’ve ran the last 200 m by himself
These slowmos of baton exchanges are taking years off of my life.
Congrats team 🇺🇸
Honest question, how would Erryon do for 3rd leg in this event?  There isn't anyone that runs a better turn than him. Does he just not have the 100 m speed?
Great race guys….
Wow! Pure dominance 😮
🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 ❤❤❤❤
Congratulations 🎊 👏 💐  team Jamaica 🇯🇲 🙌 😊
The hands passes need to be better. When they get it right, it’s NO stopping them.
Lol, I'm gonna be on it! Come on Noah! Lol, man is crazy
USA❤ CONGRE🎉🎉🎉🎉😊
6:39 Crazy how elite Olympic athletes can really struggle with handoffs.
Jamaica mek Italy beat them… EMBARRASSING
It was the  vibration of the 8 lane! Turn it sideways. Infinity.
Congratulations 🎊 Team USA🎉🎉🎉...
Usa 3xgold Noah!
Very happy for the United States but Carnes does not belong there. The USA can really do better with someone on that turn, and there’s way better athletes than some unknown athlete like Carnes.
Noah lyles: America has a problem!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That's how you get the job done, God bless team 🇺🇸 USA!!! GOD BLESS AMERICA 🇺🇸
I went to high school in the same area as Noah Lyles at the same time. He and his brother have always been special and he was the hardest worker even as a freshman. Awesome to see hope he gets gold next year.
Congratulations to 🇺🇸USA🇺🇸, handoff was shaky but the monster that is Lyles showed up and showed out, been a fan since I saw him at PENN. Glad to see 🇯🇲Jamaica🇯🇲 back on the podium after Bolt retired with the Jamaican🔥Fiya🔥
what is it with usa and baton passes? this has been an issue for both men and women for years....really embarrassing at this level....
Noah lyes runs like a greyhound
Congratulations to italy. That was a great run by them. Terrible exchanges by the Americans but got the job done. I guess you know, not as bad as the women's 4x400 but hey!
That's how you get it done Team USA!! 🔥🏃🏿❤ Making us proud!!❤️‍🔥
Speed and Skill Park0ur should be in the Olympics.
Let's go USA. Best of the best.
As i said in a comment under the Women's 4X100...As good as it gets! A GOLDEN TEAM; Christian, Fred, Brandon, and Noah! Whew-wee!
AMAZING!!!! CONGRATULATIONS USA!!!
I would love to have seen Bolt and Lyles line up against each other.
With Noah Lyles anchoring,  Team USA will win this every time because Noah Lyles is normally slower out of the Blocks BUT he gets a running start in the Relays! ...  Congratulations to TEAM USA
“SENSATIONAL”       -Future Hendrix 😂🤣😂
TCB!!!!
TEAM USA!!!!
Lyles’ stride looks like a distance runner on 4x speed xD
Love how Noah keep it real with his teammates… we’re together, but we’re also as individuals!!!
No, the dream would be knighton not carnes
Coleman ran up on Fred a lil bit .. i feel they can go 37 flat 😮… beautiful run !
Jamaican black dude got run down by Italian white dude. Last time was a British black dude.
This is what happens when USA doesn't mess up positions in the Relay.
LETS GOOOOO‼️‼️‼️‼️
Whomever is putting these Jamaican relay teams is definitely getting compensated by someone to ensure Jamaica remains ineffective.
Team USA 🇺🇸 LFG!!! 🥇
Speed that's good placement was good as far as speed the stick ok but they got it done thanks utube
at 4:15 coleman was already celebrating, he already knew!
Race starts at 4:00
United States better get another Baton Coach.The winen,and mens Struggles passing the Baton.
Easy sub 37 with decent handoffs…
Overdrive!
Every time Watching the US team passing the baton is really a torture to me, including this world championship.  All three baton  passes for the US  were all bad., but at least they didn't drop it.  even just a little improvement of the passing technique may create a new world record.
Italy smoked jamaica..
Congrats for US track for great performances during the meet. However, The US had poor baton handoffs in all of the relay events. Why does this continue to be a problem the past two decades? Isn’t someone responsible for training that can clean up these exchanges?
If they could get decent handoffs they might have pushed the WR. I don't know why they didn't use Knighton on 3rd leg/curve.
thank god jamaica got a medal. congrats to the USA. a playful fun fast athlete is hard to beat noah lyles . good championship so far  jamaica did well than i thought for a while i was wondering how things was going to be but they did great big up to the girl team also you guys did very well also the field events. blessings
Can you imagine winning THREE GOLD MEDALS like what Noah Lyles just did (amazing feat 👏🏼 👏🏼), and ALSO wining Gold in the Long Jump at the same meet? That’s what Carl Lewis did at the Olympics in 1984.
The guys got it together and showed out! So happy for them! Nobody was beating them. Team USA
10:05  "bet"
That race was over before it started.  GO U.S.A.!!!!
USA!!! USA!!! Nothing else to say.
Great job USA crew!! Lyles has such insane acceleration, wow. Congrats to Italy for Silver and Jamaica for Bronze!
US Killed it.....that was one of the most amazing races I've seen in a long time!  Jamacia who???  Japan is the team we need to worry about!
That race was fast af sheesh
Can we please stop spoiling the outcome in the title? This is crazy. takes out all the excitement of watching
Bruh Coleman came out blazing!!!! And Noah is just not getting dogged ever !
Noah doesn’t even look like he’s trying hard, that the entire team is fast 💨
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
The non-Japanese Japanese guy took off way too fast and cost his team
That italian anchor leg was cookin too
Wow Italy great job lol!!
❤❤❤ Go USA Go Fuuuh The Gold
Go US but props to Italy
Team USA gives me a heart attack every time with their horrendous handoffs!
That was a delightful race. Congrats guys
Great race 🏁 finally they put the right 4 in the relay. Shout out to Noah for getting those 3 gold medals 🏅 🥇 🏅👏🏾
What that's gesture, for..
Congratulations USA!!! You all done that
Remember when Blake, Powell, & Bolt were on the same team?
Noah lyles top end speed is insane.. everybody else peaked at the 50 meter mark and he was still gaining speed
-Reporter  “is this the Team for Paris?”  -Lyles   “ima be on it”, *chuckles🤣*
Sani-Brown had to turn around f/ the stick. Uncharacteristic f/ that quartet
4:00 to skip to the start of the race
Awful passes. 😮
Still no where near Yohan and  bolt 4x1. They were so fast.
USA,USA,USA, congrats ✡️⚡🙏✌️👁️🇺🇸
Jamaica had their shine, U.S. was always in their shadow during the Bolt-Powell-Blake era, but now the world is catching Jamaica, meanwhile the US is crushing the world.
How did an all white team get silver haaha that's the real surprise
USA!!!!!!!
Noah fumbled that last question.  That's about the only mistake he has made.
Let’s Go 🇺🇸!!!!!!
Italy won gold
Even with bad baton passes they win the gold.  If they pass cleanly it wouldn't be close.
Team USA 🇺🇲!!! Good job Italy
No one can touch Noah!
a slower get out is better than one to fast! congrats USA
If we had noah lyes.. in that great 4x1 race that would have been something.
Great job by USA but Lyles should have given more respect to this teammates near the end of the interview. Don’t be an individual especially when you’re the star. Build up your fellow athletes. There is no I in team be humble.
Grats for the men pulling out another great win.  World Champs...love it!  If we could just get those handoffs going.  I said it on the ladies vid that we need a more dedicated team to run these sprint relays where handoffs mean the difference because the only way you get great passes is by practice and these guys don't get enough when we're subbing peeps in/out.
"I'M gonna be on it !!" 😂
Close calls with baton passes.
Worlds best starter as well as world's best top speed 🥴
Team USA!!!
Good job USA, but how is Jamaica losing to Italy
Team usa has always been dominate in relays. Their only set back was the era of runners we had against bolt. All of them are great at that time but relay wise america should be dominant
“I’m a be on it” 😂😂😂 my man has no filter 🇺🇸
Noah Lyles leg was Insane!!!! Also big shout out to Tortu he ran fantastic!!
Y'all better be paying attention to those white-looking boys. He came in second. America’s finest still the champ.
USA always has bad hand offs. Always. So much talent. Still, well done. A win.
Now it’s time to get in done in 2024
Team USA 🇺🇸 is making me so happy 😢🙌🏾! We deserve it !
Wow! Just so wonderful. What a group of talented young men. Noah Lyles just has been so outstanding in the worlds and in previous competions. Gold again! I was looking forward to seeing Erriyon Knighton run with him in the 4x100m.
there is nothing like sportsmanship in these games weather its this or the olympics the respect lever is off the charts.
The Japanese 3rd leg runner was motoring
WOW!!! ALL those teams are SOOOO fast. Awesome..
*Looking forward to a healthy Treyvon Bromell to join Noah Lyles, Fred Kerley and Christian Coleman as team USA Olympic 4x100m relay team.*
They had another .2-.3 seconds in the race with cleaner 1st and 2nd exchanges
I understand dude at 5:10 pain lol He was RIGHT there for a chance at the podium 🥲 Gotta keep at it. USA couldn't pass the baton for nothing...but they were so fast it didn't matter I guess 💀
USA: bad hand offs but still destroyed the competition. Shows how talented those young men are!
In a world filled with uncertainty, you guys bring excitement, and possibility. I am so proud of you, I salute you.
these chaps would have been crushed during Bolt era
How about Italy 🇮🇹 😮
Tortu is the truth
That last leg 🦵 for Italy 🇮🇹 was MOVING...
USA Men Kilt it!
!🇺🇸!🥇💞
Congratulations USA but you need to improve on baton passing.
They get better handoffs and they could beat the world record
Congrats team
They gotta do better with these handoffs, couldve broke the record. It was a great race nonetheless. Noah saved the day on that anchor tho.
If they would have executed the baton pass better they could have probably done a few tenths of a second better... but luckily it didn't matter.  LETS GO USA!  Lyles and Richardson are amazing!
They could of had a better time if not for the bad handoffs
Great job gents! 🙌🏾
Noah’s stride is immaculate! USA 🇺🇸
Noah Lyles Top speed has sub 9.7 written all over it
❤❤❤❤
Go Italy!
Did you see Italy, though! awesome job
I love how happy Italy is lol
maybe they could get the WR with some cleanup on the handoffs👀👀👀👀 great job usa!
Shout out Italy too man, I liked how excited they were. That was cool.
A USA Dream Team really...they delivered wow. Nobody's catching Noah. And watching Italy's Fillipo Tortu handle the GB and Jamaica anchors..gone in three strides...that was impressive.
So proud of you men💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾🇺🇸🔥🔥🔥🔥🇺🇸 Congratulations ❤❤❤❤
FANTASTIC!!! I love it when a plan comes together!!! 👏🏽
USA got men, USA got women. Any questions?
Our handoffs are trash but good thing we have natural athletes
Japan needed better guys in the middle... it came up quite strong towards the end, but there's too much grounds to make up, in those last few dozen meters....
Now what did Tortu split? He's such a consistent anchor so far.
@6:54 - Noah's STRIDE, tho . . . Just throws his front foot into the next county and wills his body to follow.
It’s too competitive in the states baby… we dominate
Congratulations USA!  Noah Lyles runs like a Gazelle; smooth as butter.   💯💯💯
7:02 Lyles's face is pure conviction. So cool!
Congratulations gentlemen 🎉
I'm beyond disappointed in my country's performance. They let us down again.
Great to see the world coming together and having some fun. Track and Field to the World!❤❤❤
Could a track aficionado explain why the order of athletes in a relay race matters? Eg anchor position? Aren’t they all running as fast as they can anyways?
Handoffs drive coaches crazy.
once lyles got the baton even with the field I knew it was over, ain't no one in the world gonna run him down on anchor leg!
fix those handoffs and we get a new wr
Congrats to team USA but Tortu got some jets
So proud!!!
WOW 🇺🇸 !!!!!!!
haha noah lyles pretty much said hes a lock to be on the 4x4 team but no one else was that sure
Woo!  Congrats Noah for three golds and all the men for that world championship
guy was way too happy to be in 2nd lol
As impressive as Noah Lyles was on anchor ( even with Jamaica at the handoff)  not as impressive as Tortu who had another blistering anchor similar to the Olympics 4x100m. He just flew past the Jamaican  and British sprinter like they were standing still.
May have been a world record without those bad baton passes. Really proud as an American to have the fastest man and woman in the world.
The way they cam off the last curve 4 abreast...!!! Then Lyles pulls away.!!!
Knighton needs that 3rd leg 🦵🏾
the US needs to get a new baton coach cus we cant have a clean exchange to save our lives
Congrats Jamaican🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
❤❤❤❤❤❤usa
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Italy! 😮
VIVAAAAAAA 🇺🇸!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Noah Lyles is a beast!!!     Announcer - “Is this the team for Paris…this four??  Noah Lyles - “I’m going to be on it!!!”
Crazy that the handoffs were still suspect and yet they get the WL time
YES!!
THAT ANCHOR LEG FOR ITALY WAS MOOOVVVVIIINNN!!!
Noah saved us all….
Way to go USA congratulations exciting to watch gold  🏅
USA USA USA USA USA USA USA!!! VOTE 4 TRUMP 2024!!!
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
On all of our relays this year we have had HORRIBLE handoffs. They need to sharpen this before the Olympics.
Team USA was 🔥!!
At 31.7 lyles switches gears that’s Krazy
Easily shave a half second or more with better handoffs.  The last one was just plain scary but GOLD IS GOLD BABY!!!!
😭😭😭💕💕💕🔥🔥🔥
Tortu for Italy Very underwater sprinter. But Noah Lyles in his own world
imma be on it” I love this guy Noah’s confidence
Might be able to cut .5-1 sec just by passing it better 😅😂
The fact we were able to win even with those horrendous passes says those boys had their jetpacks on! Lyles & Coleman were MOVING lol 🏃💨
Congratulations to Christian Coleman, Fred Kerley and Brandon Carnes  and Noah Lyles 🎉🥇
Man we really need a 110 shuttle hurdle relay I still don’t understand why that’s only a high school event, it’s so electric
well, Jamaica. You've had a good run. Now time to settle for 2nd place if you're lucky which wasn't in this case. I guess 3rd place will do 🤣🤣🤣
I love Fred's answer — "You know how track and field works." Nuff said.
Noah hit the afterburners
Let's goooo! TEAM USA! wish the womens team could've made it.
japan could have finished top 3, that final shaky baton pass cost them
christian with a whole bakery 😂
Japan would have been second except for its awful passing
Congrats, USA!
The interview😂😂😂
This was an amazing race! Great relay line up for USA 👏! 🇺🇸
Let’s go!! USA FOCUSED ON ALL SIDES
Jamaica not putting Seville as the anchor seems silly.
Yessssssss🚀🚀
Didn’t Jamaica 🇯🇲get beaten by the USA 🇺🇸 when they had 3 champions like Shelly Ann, Shericka and Elaine?
Noah Lyles, way to BALL OUT, Brotha! 🇺🇸 💪🏽
Japan ran great! Keeping up with the US runner until the handoff to Lyles.
The U.S. men's 4x100 relay team will never break the world record.
Lol with all the praises wheres the championship or world record.😂😂
They were sensational indeed! Awesome job USA.
Noah Lyles is just too cold 🥶
USA USA USA!!
Nobody is a match for Noah Lyles once he hits top speed.  WOW!!
Congrats, boys. I don't trust Fred. What kind of hand off was that. I'm willing to bet money he forgot he was in a relay race. He's lackadaisical.
*Future voice* Sensational
Tortu must have a crazy top speed.
Great Italian running!
Lyle's different different
If Japan would of had a good hand off to the anchor this race would of been epic between US and JP.
Didn't see Italy w silver
Tortu always crushes the anchor leg, but Noah Lyles was in a whole other gear
Italia wasn't fucking around....wow👏🏻
Those were crazy passes lol😅
Usain Bolt, the world loved him, Noah not so much. Something about him🥱
Great Job Italy 🇮🇹 👏 😊
Sensational 🫶🏾💪🏿💪🏿💯💯😂😂😂
THREE GOLD MEDALS!!!!! WAY TO GO NOAH LYLES.. We're extremely proud of you guys, Coleman was shot out of a rocket!!!!! Gotta love this❤
That’s a Gold for the Brothers representing the USA!
Italy did a nice job..☝️
THREEEEEE! For NOAH!!!! ❤🤍💙
Congratulations
Dat 4x1 wr gon be hard to touch
Foundational Black Americans!!! The worlds greatest athletes!!!
They put THE anchor where he always should have been 🎉🎉🎉  USA USA USA
🔥🔥🔥🔥🇺🇸🏅
Bolt’s era will forever be remembered but it’s Lyles now. Looking forward to a longer streak of wins for team USA over the years ahead. 🔥
Jamaica quiet lately 🥴
Awesome!
Awesome
Three horrible passes.  They should be ashamed and not be celebrating at all despite the goal.  A better Jamaican team would have destroyed the US.
Buck teeth Noah is very boastful.
I don't see nobody in a dress
Let's Gooooo 🇺🇸
Great job men of Team USA🎉 🇺🇸!!! Great run🏃🏾‍♂️!!! Christian knows how to get a great start.  Great job Italy 🇮🇹 .  Be well and be at peace.
World class! Thanks guys! Kudos!
LET'S GOOOOOOO
USA are having a monster Worlds. Just fire.
Awesome USA. And Seville was blazing on his leg. So was last guy for Italy. All ran well
Men and Women's teams killed it🙌🙌
With better exchanges they could shave 0.5... I hope they get lots of practice before the Olympics.
That time cracks the top 10 fastest 4x100 relays ever by any country. And that last hand off was bad and still DID THAT. Noah lyles is him!! USA 🇺🇸
Crazy thing is Noah could run the 4x4 that would be insane
Congratulations
💯thangs 💯
USA!!!
He Dog Walked them boys 🤣🤣🤣
Great last handoff for the US. Noah's even good at that... the rest were safe at least. Tortu an absolute gunner for Italy on the anchor, as always.
holy cow. the starting leg dude had to have turbo boost enabled. :) what a race and the last leg looked amazing. congrats to all the competitors.
The Docu Series is going to be fire !!!! This was an epic championship for Lyles !!!
Happy for the boys, but in the end all that matters is Paris!
knighton should be third leg
Tortu is a freak anchor for Italy. He ran out of his mind again, just like he did at the Olympics.
Jamaica who ?
Outstanding win but I gotta say on both men and women’s teams I have never seen such sloppy baton passing ever. They better tighten this up before Paris.
Bro used all his emotes
This is such a great team, but I feel like Knighton would definitely make it the dream team.
Any one of those baton passes could've ended ugly. It was game over. Gold looks good you! 🥇
America leaving All Yall Mofos in the dust Yet Again!
Love to see all of this USA winning!
Georgie Duarte
Great Job team USA. Tortu is a rocket once he has a rolling start. If Lyles wasn't there they might have won it.
Dang! Lyles burned up the track at these championships. AND the hand-off to him was neither suspect nor iffy. It wasn't perfect, but it was better than most. Congrats to the Italians too.
Battyman usa
Noah just put on the afterburners.
that was three atrocious handoffs by the united states. who is coaching these athletes for the relay events? US would've broken 37 if they had good handoffs
If the US gets those baton passes cleaned up, it wouldn't be close.
Congrats fellas 🔥🔥🔥🥇
He came back even stronger
This particular US team is really strong in this event. A real treat to watch
Italy was haulin azz too!!!!
My question is when did Italy become one of the world's sprint nations? Who's their coach again? Because he deserves applause. The United States is going to dominate the sprint for the next few years though. But good job guys!!❤❤❤
Team USA Men for the GOLD!!! Thank you for bringing the title back to the USA!! Slightly shakey passes, but they got the job done!!
USA there is a New Dominant power in SPRINTS!!!
been waiting for this video to drop‼️‼️‼️
Just to show you Bolt was the best the sprints had. He won GOLD in record-breaking times. It was the peak of the sport. Good job to Lyles.
Wow, 🎉🎉🎉Go USA👑👑👑
USA as expected but those freakin Italians though... Pietro Mennea would be proud
wow USA men and ladies 4x1 win Gold  great year
Nah the real dream team would be the USA 4x2 team and everybody knows
Knighton??
I think one of our usa men's best teams ever!!!
It literally made me tear up watching our boys crush the world and Lyles going for three! God bless America
So proud to see Noah finally getting his due. Celebrate this man--he's much more than a 200m specialist.  Handoffs could be better, so definitely think this lineup can break 37 and challenge the WR with some sharper exchanges and maybe a substitute for Carnes (no offense).
Coleman, Kerley & Lyles' legs should be locked in for years to come! 3 WC on one relay did not disappoint. 3rd leg should be reserved for Knighton/Norman moving forward!
Was anything else expected? Men’s and women’s USA teams are both BEASTS.
Just like the women; if we clean up those handoffs, the time would be so much better! Amazing win nonetheless; no one was catching Noah. And Christian’s start is just criminal 😂😂so good
"If they're even, He's leaving"... lol...
Its insane that the third leg switched hands there before the hand off
Jamaica getting beat by Italy is insane 💀💀 USA 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
whoever is titling these should leave off the results...it's a race ...duh.
If the 2nd to 3rd exchange was smoother they would have been sub 37 for sure
Team USA relay teams (men and women) looking unbeatable for the next 4+ years.  Dominant in both 4x1 and 4x4.   Love to see it. 🔥
This was to ne expected
As long as the US doesn't fumble the baton they are unstoppable
You guys did it!!!
ERRYION KNIGHTON 3rd LEG!!!!!!!
The way Lyles accelerates is just otherworldly...Insane actually. Nobody in the world can catch him.
✅✅✅
Back in black
Lyles with a 8.76 3 fastest all time 😶‍🌫️
Erryion Knighton should've been 3rd leg .. world record
🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
should have had knighton on 3rd
So much power. Lyles is a goat..💪🥇
great job USA!!!
Coleman gets out like a rocket 🚀. Handoffs weren’t the best, but we dominated. Congratulations!🇺🇸🔥
Congratulations usa team and Noah!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
stop posting the result in the title please
Third
Team USA’s  Mens 4x100m were on fire 🔥. Noah as always, changed gears and gapped the field to clinch gold 🥇. Redemption was made.
I love Track and field
