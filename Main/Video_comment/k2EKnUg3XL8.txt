Knew straight away when he was at Celtic that he was top class . Great player 🍀
People should realise what an amazing captain he is.
Garry is good at his job
I have emense respect for Virj but he can't disrespect Carra like that. I am a huge kopite, what would have Virj done if he had played for Liverpool from 2010-2015 that's the question.
Say allahuma barik inshallah liverpool win and they stay and salah wins ballon dor dont punish us and guide salah 😅😊
big v,,,living legend,so glad we signed him
Virgil has a great laugh and down right a solid guy 👦
Indonesia
VVD nearly died when he was in his TEENS due to somekind of infection i think??
Bit harsh on Carra that 😅
Pure respect for VVD. Amazing personality.
Carra's was better than vvd is 😂
Excellent overlap gotta love VVD
Where was this filmed? Looks really nice, would like to go for a walk there
Taking the piss out of carragher 😅😅😅😅😅 love it
Prachtige interview. U bent ons aanvoerder ❤. Beste verdediger ter wereld!
11:16 True AF if the player is bad in ball they still praise him like a world class player lol... Overrated English players.Especially Roy Keane he only got 7 red card in his entire career and they are talking about him like he is Hitler imagine Sergio Ramos playing in EPL he will be Satan. Lol
If you really think about this, if your Jamie Carragher and if your listening to this  you should be delighted , because he was a quality player and there are still quality players giving there blood for the badge. I am a united fan and we really don't have players better that the once that got us everything , not even one .  This should tell you alot.
absolutely no doubt he has put in the greatest performances and has the best individual skills and strengths of any CB ever seen in the PL. Longevity is an issue but the best I have seen, much like Suarez up front. But, he has the opportunity over the next few years as captain to cement his place. Unbelievable defender and player, perfect in 2019, best I have ever seen.
12:49 thoughest vvd played against
Solid quiet confidence,,wish he spoke a bit more of his time at Celtic,,ps Virgil,,,Andy Robertson was at Celtic,,,we let him go,,,fitba pros eh? Coaches fk up same as the rest of us.
Someone tag Jamie lol
Another Celtic Legend
Love this! genuine
❤
He WAS the best defender in the world for two seasons.
Great interview 👍 👏 👌 🙌 💪 🙏 ❤
Celtic fan here, you could tell as soon as he played he was destined for greatness. Comfortable on the ball, strong in the tackle and a threat from set pieces. Celtic know a player when we have them. Proud to call him one of our own
No way is Van dyke one of too defenders in world . He not even close .
Not in first 20 😂
The clap-back at Carra is very much warranted! He mouthed off too much when VVD and the team were in a bad spell as if he was a sterling defender! Carra has the second record for the most own goals in the EPL! You cannot be too critical of other defenders when you hold such a record....just saying.
Never was the best centre half. What a massive ego to say you're the best yourself, be more humble
Klopp cherry picks the players he wants and only goes for them after finding out about their personality and attitude. We've seen it before. He will wait to get the right player and that's why I'm confident Bellingham will be an LFC player come the summer
I'm sorta a bit surprised with his carra bit. He repped for the locals and I thought he was solid and always gave everything for the shirt
I saw Virgil playing for Celtic and thought he would be perfect for us at LFC but I didn't think he would end up here. Victor Wanyama was another player I hoped we would end up getting but obvs he went spurs. Even Dembele. Gutted at time, that he went Lyon and I don't think we ever really even considered him.
you seriously need t henry on this
I'd pick my nan over joe Gomez, she's been dead 20 year's
Who here because Van Djik said Carragher wouldn't get in the current match day squad of Liverpool? Carragher replied with Liverpool beating Real over 2 legs with 2 clean sheets smashing them 5-0. Tonight Van Djik and co shipped 5 goals at Anfield. Washed up. Carragher would definitely take his place, guy can't defend without a full team pressing in front of him.
Looking for the comment saying they're sponsored by a betting company 😆
Is The Rock his dad?
I think he has jinxed the other Liverpool CB's by saying they are better than Carra. They have proven they couldn't lace Carra's boots.
this has not aged well. carragher is BETTER than konate, matip, gomez. I would take carra every day of the week. but cheers to VVD, he has to stand up for his team mates.
Great defender of his time but I’d he better than the likes of Terry Rio Adams Vidic Kompany ?..  when every team had a number 9 who was big strong players
This did not age well. Carra prolly will be picked against any of the lads right now. not even at his prime, but at the moment Carra might be better.
Bodied carra
Where’s the next OL video !?!?
Reece James is best right back in the world right now
What carah and Gerrard  gave was 100% no comparison 2022 is reflection for our defenders who think they are the best
Carragher could learn a thing or 2 from Virgil, Carragher is a shithouse human being and Virgil is an absolute gent and speaks so well...no spitting at fans from him !!
Virgil seems like a really good egg
Neville.. ITV's answer to Lineker, pair of political crap spouting idiots..
Ronald Koeman 🧠 , c'mon guys
I'm a Liverpool fan...diehard. Have no problem saying Neville is the best pundit in the world...not even close
The Giroud's haters must be so desperate when he named Giroud the harsh nightmare for him as a striker... when you know the numbers of international top srikers which were playing in the same championship and he mentionned the national team level  as well for Giroud.. .That proves that Giroud is the most underrrated striker of all footbal History, he doesn't deserve the way many are disrespecting or even insulting him. Thanks Virgil for your talk about Giroud, you have rehabilitated him and you knw what you are talking of, I guess ;)
That's genuinely one of the best interviews I've ever seen
I love how gary stopped himself from referring to Saha as Strong and Fast. 😂😂😂
So you’re telling me if Van Dijk never went to Saint James’ Park, Liverpool would still be struggling to win a title. I would love to give my deepest love to Newcastle ❤️
Why did he have to explain it!!!! 😂😂😂😂 should have left it early when it looked like a harmless joke.
Get Andrew Tate on!!
carra was so shit. He's more remembered for speaking bad about Ronaldo than anything. Most kids wouldn't even know who he is
Any news on Ronaldo  ?
Jaap stam
Some fans on social media go too far and turn people off Virgil , but him from 2017-2022 he was brilliant that injury fucked him up , he went a full year without being dribbled past that's ridiculous and is the reason he was slightly beaten to the ballon d'Or by Messi in 2020 ,he came 2nd
We won’t see Ronaldo on Overlap ever 😢
I have started thinking that Gary is our former player,hardly see him interviwing United players
18:34 This is where I am at, update soon
VVD is the dutchest dutchman there is lol. Dude just shreds people with no regard. 😂
First I tougt, well thats gonna be somewhat awkward. But then it turned to realy honest discussion
The way they Smoked Carragher together 😂😂 I love this seriesss
im a Arsenal fan, but im a big  Van DijK admirer and the best thing is that Salba will be at his level soon😎
He occupies “the stage” on this interview as much as he does on the field 😊 he is huge for LFC
get Andy Murray on
Van is trash
Good to see everyone considers Reece as a quality player.
such a humble guy, have big respect for him🤍🤍🤍
😢
Would love if you'd invite Klopp next, maybe Raheem Sterling who has a brilliant story to his path to success, Phil Jones, KDB, or Wilfred Zaha.
I bet you that surprised people him saying giroud being the best striker
Gary took of his Stoney badge cause he doesnt want that kind of heat
Best CB in the world
As a Liverpool fan, I used to really dislike Gary, but that's football. I can honestly say I really like him as a pundit, and his opinions are always fair. I also won't ever forget what he did for football on the pitch and also against the super league nonsense. Virgil is such a chilled guy, an absolute inspiration for many including my son who plays academy football.
great interview thumbs up.Virgil  outside the football pitch,  man looks  those hollywood black american  movie stars..great to see the other side of football stars very chilled guy
Top man but most overated player in world football after Messi.   People talking about him in the same bracket as Maldini, Nesta, Baresi, Cannavaro, Chiellini, Ramos, Puyol, Terry, Stam etc.  He’s had 2 good seasons & 1 great season. Nowhere near the levels of world class strikers in world football anymore. Kane, Lewandowski & Benzema and that’s it. And two of them are 34. (Haaland isn’t there yet).   If he played 10 years ago he’d be just another half decent Centre Back.
Definition of real life positive vibes only!!!!  Thanks to Klopp one of the most humble person in the world
Anyone else getting anxiety watch Virgil’s dunks in the mud
Need one of these with Trent Alexander - Arnold 🙏🏽
When £75 million pounds spent is a bargain!
Less feelings more football please.
Watch the whole interview w/ Van Dijk on 0,25 speed, believe me you wont regret it
Thiago silva would be good for this
Maybe klopp watches the opposition to check out players attitudes in case that player comes into his thoughts at a later date , we know he loves a good attitude and work ethic
Poor Carra I'd have him over Gomez and Konate
VVD best centre back in the world ? HAHAHA behave
Does anyone know where this was filmed?
Why the fuck is there a need to always ask if someone needed to see a psychiatrist or therapist? Who gives a fuck!
It’s a shame I think he’d make a great pundit I feel he could analyse a game very well and actually not sound like he’s waffling like some pundits now a days
Carragher is better than joe gomez, joel matip and  konate, no problem. He'd start alongside van dijk
Gorgeous man in and out
Neville often states how much he hates Liverpool - I can state right now that I will always hate that Manc. YNWA.
The English fans thought this guy was gonna be rubbish cause he was good in Scotland. He takes the piss England 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 that's English wankers  for ye
I bet they're hating their trainer's getting dirty
BEST CB????? Lmfao. Maybe top 10 for a year. ✌🏼
Anyone know where is this walk? Looks so beautiful!
He’s not even better then John stones.
hes not the best anymore he's shit, and this is coming from a Liverpool supporter
That was some spanking on HIGNFY. Has your botty cooled down yet?
Thanks Neville for such a good interview with incredible Van Dijk
Great interview VVD #YNWA
https://youtu.be/k0lSWF3e04k
Gary delivering invisible carpets again
7:35 poor Gomez 🥲  Carra wouldn't handle playing with such a high line so I have to agree tbh that he wouldn't be in the top 4
Has Gary been cooking up Meth in that outfit?
He's our centre half He's our number four
A classy guy. Being interviewed by the UK’s biggest hypocrite. Enjoy your Qatari blood money Gary 👍
31:32  i feel like virg is talking about the 2022 ucl final where he was sticking his ass out during valverdes cross. people put a bang bros logo over it lmao
never thought Liverpool would have another player as influential and consistent week in week out as Gerrard. VVD is that player. all their trophies in recent years were because of him. will lift another european cup for sure.
Get CR7 on overlap
Am i missing something?? Y does he not like carra?? When neville said he likes u he sais 'whenever it suits him'
Harsh on Carra🤣
France had dugarey and givarche in 98…. At the time people said they had no strikers but in many ways their impact was similar to giroud…or vice versa
Love Virgil, shame he’s being interviewed by a hypocritical bellend
Already sowing the seeds to join Newcastle xD
I will allways rember at hibs away n he lined up for free kick. I said to my pal why he away to take free kick hes pish at free kicks. Guess what he only went n scored from free kicked didnt he 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Agree completely about Carragher.  Besides, he takes us completely for granted these days and puts the knife in any time he thinks it will get him a bit of publicity.  I really don't like him as a pundit.
VVD was already the best PL defender for us at Southampton without a doubt. He was the same player at Liverpool but people noticed him more and became widely considered one of the best defenders in the world. He’s not wrong when he says he went under the radar. When he signed for Saints from Celtic he was already a top top top player. Didn’t watch him in the SPFL but I’m willing to bet he was probably the best player in their league at the time
As a united fan...this guy is absolutely likable and vibes ..too bad he plays for those bums...😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I do enjoy these, but the one thing i would love, is Gary to ask EVERY player or x player he interviews their true opinion on VAR, it would be interesting to see how the players feel about it.... That would be one question i would ask for it to be asked of them all
I'm sorry but once Virgil retires we need him and Rio Ferdinand as a punditry duo
As a United fan, before we signed Lisandro Martinez, a defender with attributes like Van Dijk is a dream to have in your team. Along with his charisma, he'll be the club captain on Day 2.
Where does he talk about Martinez?
Gary comes across as a right old lefty on social media. Never misses a chance to publically signal his virtue. Likes to create an image of the all round decent bloke looking out for the little guy.  .....and then he goes and works at the Qatar world cup.  I guess we all have a price, eh Gary?
He isn’t even in the top three cbs in the north east this season let alone world
I'm a Utd fan so was great to see him mention Stam, seems to get "forgotten" about by the experts when they talk about great PL defenders.  Spoke well on Martinez aswell, good interview, nice respectful bloke.
VVD is so very handsome, what a smile 😍
sure but Gallium is a chemical element with the symbol Ga and atomic number 31. Discovered by French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran in 1875,[6] Gallium is in group 13 of the periodic table and is similar to the other metals of the group (aluminium, indium, and thallium). Gallium exhibits relatively less similarity with boron due to latter being small in atomic size and lacking its reach to d-orbital.  Elemental gallium is a soft, silvery metal in standard temperature and pressure. In its liquid state, it becomes silvery white. If too much force is applied, the gallium may fracture conchoidally. Since its discovery in 1875, gallium has widely been used to make alloys with low melting points. It is also used in semiconductors, as a dopant in semiconductor substrates.  The melting point of gallium is used as a temperature reference point. Gallium alloys are used in thermometers as a non-toxic and environmentally friendly alternative to mercury, and can withstand higher temperatures than mercury. An even lower melting point of −19 °C (−2 °F), well below the freezing point of water, is claimed for the alloy galinstan (62–⁠95% gallium, 5–⁠22% indium, and 0–⁠16% tin by weight), but that may be the freezing point with the effect of supercooling.  Gallium does not occur as a free element in nature, but as gallium(III) compounds in trace amounts in zinc ores (such as sphalerite) and in bauxite. Elemental gallium is a liquid at temperatures greater than 29.76 °C (85.57 °F), and will melt in a person's hands at normal human body temperature of 37.0 °C (98.6 °F).  Gallium is predominantly used in electronics. Gallium arsenide, the primary chemical compound of gallium in electronics, is used in microwave circuits, high-speed switching circuits, and infrared circuits. Semiconducting gallium nitride and indium gallium nitride produce blue and violet light-emitting diodes and diode lasers. Gallium is also used in the production of artificial gadolinium gallium garnet for jewelry. Gallium is considered a technology-critical element by the United States National Library of Medicine and Frontiers Media.[7][8]  Gallium has no known natural role in biology. Gallium(III) behaves in a similar manner to ferric salts in biological systems and has been used in some medical applications, including pharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals.
Serious question, does anyone know the Gilet that GNev is wearing?
Neville had to play against a lot  better strikers. Van dijk should be interviewing him
Doe's Neville have a MarsBar in his pocket?  👀
What's this jacket Neville is wearing haha
Van Dijk is not the best CB in the world.
was this recorded 2 years ago when he was good?
Love how he has the English sense of humour a good guy
Even tho I'm a United fan I have a lot of respect for VVD he’s a great player n has been the best CB in the world for the last 4 years🤷🏾‍♂🤷🏾‍♂being a United fan means I can’t help but be happy to see him fail that’s juss how it is but I still rate him very highly as a player n he’s such a humble guy as well so as a person I can’t hate on him at all✅✅as a CB as well I base my game off players like him in terms of his ball playing ability n composure but like Carra the one thing he does lack is aggression in his defending 🤧🤧the goal they conceded vs Forest was literally a carbon copy of the goal in the UCL final Madrid scored when instead of dealing with the cross properly he swings his leg back to try n look effortless ffs🤦🏾‍♂🤦🏾‍♂
He is not the world's best CB
If Virgil plays in Gerrard’s Liverpool, I believe the team at least won 1 PL title.
Love Virgil but Garys still a top bell
Not because I am a fellow Dutchman, but what a character. Well spoken, confident, relaxed and an absolute personality. Pure respect. Virg, you make us proud!
I used to like Gary a lot. Now I'm sorry to say I have lost respect for him...
Get Mark Goldbridge on the overlap
overlap is that latin for mufc tv
Biggest hypocrite aswell. Cries 24/7 about slavery 400 years ago. But slavery going on right now is super duper fine!!
Great interview, Cheers.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
I'd have carragher ahead of him and the other 3 he mentioned tbh
Southampton fans knew Virgil was easily worth the 75m... But of course no one recognises good Southampton players.
Groningen, Celtic, Liverpool, Netherlands... I'm sure there was another club he played for and captained 🤔
Can't overlook the Gary Neville   Quatar deal I still can't  believe  he took the job there it goes against everything I thought he stood for
Haha I'm not being funny but currently carragher would be in the first 11. VVD has been shocking this season . Embarrassing 😳
Its beyond my mind that England give gary neville such a big platform. This man is a greedy person with no moral. Promoting qatar.... Nice work gary, f...... fool.
This is why we love Gary Neville.👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
29:35, people said that when he was at Celtic Gary, people continued to say that when he was at Southampton. That's why he eventually went to Liverpool as the most expensive defender of all time. The only reason it didn't occur to you is because he was Celtic and Southampton. Shite question from a shite pundit.
Basically he’s saying Carragher is the current Maguire who cannot play or be on a pitch. Not suited for todays game
The way they playing this season carra and agger would walk in this this team and virg is taking a seat
Why do we care what this old fella thinks these days? It not 1985 anymore (or whenever he played)!!!
What a player and what a man, the criticism he’s getting now is crazy honestly. He’s our number 4, he’s our centre half and he’s the best centre half in the world by a country mile ❤
Carra wasnt afraid of putting a tackle in though virg ..maybe watch a little more closely
The constant digs at Cara crack me up
Vvd is my idol
You learn your trade by playing football. Some of the youngsters at Chelsea, Manchester City, etc. don't get a game. I think the way Virgil came up has helped him to become the player he is today.
Virgil’s banter >
World's best CB has been getting schooled for 2 season now
I got a positive feeling about Gary here, he does this well. Virgil is always himself and does not surprise here. Enjoyable podcast.
One of the best shows keep up the good work Gary
This was enjoyable beautiful view good interview Virgil is class.
Van Djik didn't go under the radar. He just had 3 great years. Many top defenders have those.
gary licking ring as usual
Enjoyed this interview Gary!
He's a beast, he always plays great against city which does my head in. Much respect, top dude.
Carra was 10/20x better than joe gomez. And thats facts
Only here for Virgil
Loved this Gary,  he is just one at Liverpool.  Rio and Vidic, two hard men were the best !
Carr should interview Ronaldo now and get some payback for this one . Let's see if Gary's getting into this poor United team 🤣
His thought on Martinez was really good, and I still remember what Martinez told about him. Class, Virgil
What a gem....... for LFC. Love from  Afghanistan.
Stick to this Gary..You ain't becoming Mayor 👍🏻
united fan here, but this made me like this guy
Anyone who hates Van Dijk is a failure as a fan of the game  the guy is so Humble and Chill and like to crack a joke even tho he could be fill with pride.He brought Liverpool back at the very top his stats and what he achieved is insane almost won Ballon D’or when Ronaldo and Messi was dominating in 2019 as Defender 🐐🔴
VVD is absolutely one of liverpool's best ever players without the additions of him and Alisson creating the spine of the team they never would've come close to winning what they did. World class
👑👑VVD👑👑
Knew first game he came on at Celtic he was going to be the best. Knew he’d walk into any Prem team. What a player. If you’re a fan of him, look up his solo goal vs Johnstone 🥵
I'd put Carras team that thumped Madrid n united in same weak . Carra agger rise xabi macherano stevie Elnino etc up against Virg n his buddy gomez. They would whip their arses.  No respect virg no respect. Gone to your head that's why this team suffering atm   Get ur feet back on the ground.
He'd have gomez over carra that's why they got 16 points out of 12 games. Lost 2 finals in champs league. Carra fit n firing would help drag a team in a final.  He should say watkins they put 7 past em. Dnt disrespect a player with that many games under his belt
MARTÍNEZ 🔴🇦🇷
Love these chats - hopefully many more to come. Has evra done one yet?! If not, get him on
He is a terrible dresser is Nev 😅
Carra won’t be happy with Virgil’s assessment 😂
12:38 rubs on Neville's mate Ole hhahahha
Qatar Mate FFS
Carragher 10x player gomez is
Very over rated player and carragher is a way better than you if u don't know
Love the over lap,even though I'm Liverpool, Gary is doing an amazing job keep it up ...
Lol you know Gary had his team make that quote the thumbnail 🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣 https://youtu.be/-i5dRvaKj4w
Gentleman
Does a good job does neville
Why do you always shout in your intros. Relax
*1st and 9nly premier league title
Even our bitterest rivals can’t dislike him. Not a prick, quiet family man off the pitch, we don’t see him on the front page of papers…just a thorough leader and professional.  It’s like Kompany.
He hates Carra 😂😂😂
He’s not having a dig at Carra, he is raising Matip, Konate and Gomez. It’s what a leader does.
You can say what you want about Carra but without him throwing himself all over the place with cramp in the Final we wouldn't have won it. He was just as instrumental as Gerrard in that game  but it gets overlooked because goals get the highlights over raw defence. There's probably other Liverpool fans that might have a go at the Gerrard comment but if you cast your mind back to Istanbul Carra's interventions were just as important as Gerrard's goal and the way he spurred everyone on.
I can feel this coming with Bellingham, all the other class teams with endless cash, but playing under klopp at anfield having the squad built around you instantly guaranteed every minute I think they get top 4 they seal Bellingham
He's not the best CB in the world. He's had world class seasons but to call him the best in the world is incorrect. I'm a Liverpool fan, I'm just not deluded.
Kdb🤩
Virgil is a great defender and had a very good 2 season run being best defender, but stop with him being best for more than that because he didn’t though 😂 the best strikers in his time in the league are a half time injured Aguero, Kane and Giroud. Also, in the European stage he only played 5 seasons and faced only some world class attackers. Compare that with Ramos who played on the highest level since 2005 and was starter for Spain since 2007-08. He played against Prime Ronaldinho, Eto, Messi, Villa, Forlan, Zalatan, Suarez, Greizman, Torres, Aguero, Costa, Ronaldo da Lima, Falcao, Raul. All of this let alone the players he faced in Europe and world cups which Van Djik yet to play in. He is a very good defender but there are plenty of names comes before him like Ramos, Silva, Chillini, Terry, Goden, Pique, Stam, Nesta, Cannavaro, Pepe, Vidic, Puyol, Varane, Maldini, Costacorta, Company and so on.
. He has no respect.. Mr perfect arrogant
Neviles bulge is impressive 🤣
Neville. You need to wear a mini skirt
Don’t think anyone realizes how important the part he mentions with seeing a counselor. I think people need to regardless of working world. We need to let off a bit of steam now and then in order to progress in life. I love VVD for us. The best central defender we’ve had, technically and physically he is infinitely superior to everyone else I have to admit. Not a tough tackler which I wish he was, even he says he gets that shitty feeling over him which we all dread let’s admit. I see a counselor from time to time too, we’re not brick walls people. ❤
My favourite one yet 👏👏
he is honest men
What a beautiful man
Really cool podcast again with a star player. Thank you Garry. Keep the Overlap episodes going. Smashing it
Thoughts on lisandro martinez 10:33
this is why co-commentators and pundits nowadays should focus on analyzing the beauty of goals rather than defensive errors and how defenders should play to stop all the attacks. If no one makes a mistake there will be no goals and football will never be football.
Love it. You come to my firepit in my garden or we aren't doing it.
VVD has been absolutely awful this season. Maybe he should spend less time talking to this bell-end and more time on the training pitch? And I would have Carragher ahead of Gomez every day of the week.
Disappointing interview imho. GN giving very little credit to Southampton & barely mentioning VVD’s time there. Southampton fans knew he was the best centre back in the world. Pundits ignoring his talent says more about them than Southampton & VVD. GN also not brave enough to ask about Liverpool tapping VVD up.
Think it’s fair to say in the last few years Gary Neville has earned the respect of most of the people from Liverpool. He’s a man of people.
Giroud is underrated. People will only see it after he retires. Quality striker.
Martinez best defender in the Prem
Titus bramble would get in the Liverpool team on current form let alone Jamie Carragher.
Please bring on De Bruyne next
Can’t help but notice he never said that carragher wouldn’t get ahead of joe Gomez 😂😂
Watching them talk about Liverpool 2019 gives me goosebumps 😍
Turn that f***ing gas burner off.
Such a good channel.. one of the best on YouTube! 👍
What a great guy Virgil is! He definitely is a role model for younger generations. One of the best overlap episodes and cannot wait for the live show with Keano and Carragher! I do no remember any other sports show that was this good! As a personal request from the producers, if you are reading this I think it would be awesome if you can get Cantona to be on the show!! Keep up the good work!!
Even Big Virg knows Carragher was poo.
6:10 ;)
honestly the disrespect shown to other cbs is a joke vvd has played at liverfool for 5years won 5 trophys n finished runner up alot ,hes had 2 stand out seasons  .he spent over half of his career at southampton and celtic being average because lets face it if he was smashing it someone would of signed him ...not even in top ten cbs in england ever (remember football stated before the prem)if i was tony adams sol campbell john terry rio ferdnand vincent kompany booby moore des walker etc etc i would be fuming ,just shows u the power of media to push this bullshit on the undereducated football fans
vvd doesn't rate carra but rates martinez he truly know ball 😂
Van Djik has an intense personality
Why is he bitter with Carra ? What am i missing?
really enjoyed this interview , love the honesty
gary, stop shouting
Vvd4
Best cb
8:17 you know he wanted to say Matip
Big Virgil is lucky with the calibre of striker he’s come up against in his career. He’s just missed the era of drogba,van persie,Torres etc
When are you gonna talk about selling your soul for that Qatar money Gary?
Such a bright guy, I can see him being a manager one day
Amazing episode
VVD with all due respect, the way you've been playing this season, Carra in form would get into the starting line up ahead of you right now.
Look at the size of him!!! I wouldn't want to be a striker and try and pass him ha
A Colossus.
Virgil, think seriously about punditry! With your personality, knowledge, experience and the way you speak - YOU WOULD KILL IT !
It be funny if VVD said "yeah, you too"  after GN said "you mean that as well don't you?"
very surprised at the carra comments - he wasnt world class but he was a better CB than matip - gomez and konate
Virgil’s lowest point involves 8 weeks in Dubai 😭😂
Amazing footballer but pretty boring as a person. Similar to Beckham, Scholes, just dull personalities. Tyson Fury is the complete opposite, interesting from end to end
People don’t realise how good carra was. For him to say he wouldn’t make squad is a joke. Carra levels ahead of gomez

Liverpool have one league title with their best ever premier league team. Should've been 3 or 4 if it wasn't for Manchester city and guardiola , any other manager at man city and livpool would've had atleast 3 titles imo , they lost 2 titles by 1 point. 🥲
I’m sad that I like him.
VVD seems to be a very genuine person. I like his openness and honesty about mental health, Giroud, Carra etc. Kudos, from a Man United fan
van djik is not fit to clean thaigo silvas boots. he is 38 and still top level. not just one season
Not anymore lol
recently seeing ronaldo be pity towards pundits for what they said and now van dijk saying carra only likes him when he wants to might be the start of a wave of players disliking pundits, there’s been a few in the past but recently there’s been more of a dislike towards them from players
Virgil is a humble guy and would have given Carra his props but get the feeling he's giving him a taste of his own medicine this time
All the people in love here praising Virgil‘s charisma - be honest, you‘re drawn to his big dijk energy.
Im pretty sure he’ll be a top manager. Introspective. Articulate and intelligent.
As an Evertonian, I have a lot of respect for that man! Virgil Van Dijk is a great player, and after this interview, a good man. Gary Neville, moment 32.35? Is that you in your final year?
This joker has been responsible for 90% of goals that Liverpool have conceded this season, would be even more but for keeper Alison
Gary, that is one of the best episodes of Overlap. Not because I’m a Livepool fan but it has lots of hearts.
And people say that great players don't come out of SPL.
Did Gary pay Virgil to big up Dubai?? 😂 😂
Poor Jimmie....😃
The fact VVD genuinely thinks Carragher was pants is both hilarious and intriguing... there's gotta be some history there.
Van Dijk is the best CB in last twenty years 🤣
Such a pleasure to watch him lead the back line for us over the past 4-5 years. Definitely one of the best ever, doesn’t matter how late he upped his level
Tbf I didnt expect Gary to be such a good tv presenter like he is today.
Van dijk is the best 🔥🔥
32:34 I love the random slug in this video
I can't forget Neville's smile when they gossip about Carragher in their conversation. LMAO😂🤣🤣
Hes a good player but saying he's the worlds best is a bit of a overstatement...
No one has described De Bruyne quite the way Virgil does. Totally sincere and accurate in his praise for the Belgian.
Hate Liverpool and his "arrogant" on the field. But surely a top bloke
Quality as always best bit of content on youtube lately
virgil is top Center Back always defends in any game that's passion.🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.
Gary Neville - “He likes you I think” VVD - “Does he? Whenever it suits him” Safe to say VVD doesn’t like Carragher 😂
Carra gets in the team
Disrespectful to spitty
Great interview with a great competitor!
Words best CB? Lol
As much as I hate Neville for his opinion about Arsenal, I'll admit he's good pundit and interviewer, this is a perfect example.
when he's not playing for liverpool in the future, ill be rooting for this guy. He seems really likeable.
Good interview, Carragher was 10x the player some of the current Liverpool centre backs are.
Redmen question for the win
We love you big Virgil ! Amazing interview, thanks guys
This is Great Gary, can't believe the algorithm hasn't sent me here yet, so much content to absorb
Why does he hate Jamie?
Where was this filmed? Looks like such a beautiful walk
Gary chup...la, aguante lisandro martinez, la tenes adentro
no way is he the worlds best cb or has he ever been
I guess Cristiano is not going to be on the overlap now.
Shadow of the player he was
I am MU fan but so much respect to this guy
Thank you Gary Neville for putting out great content!!
He used to be the best centre back in the world but after his injury he hasn’t been the same. He needs to find that aggression back into his game otherwise it’s over for him. He will be replaced.
get Foden on
I saw him play for Celtic at Easter Road against HIibs. Absolute rolls royce, head and shoulders the best on the pitch.
qatar problem is worker abuse but betting and alcohol is okay, all is problem from mid age
Manchester United supporter, this guy is sound
Virgil is legit funny and confident
Can brits not pronounce The Netherlands or are they just stupid? Holland is a province not a country.
Mane and Virgil have play together at 2 different teams 🤯
Laughing if you think he’s the worlds best cb this season
Incredible player 🙌
Joe gomez
Nev talking about the World Cup whilst accepting a job at BeINsport is the most hypocritical bollocks in football right now. He needs to lay off talking about Qatar for a while
yes many peopel don't think about mental health enough
Man said Giroud...
I like how Virgil didn't drop out any of his teammates Matip, Gomez and Konate for Carragher, it would be very disrespectful and he handled that very good. I watch Liverpool and I am big fan since 2001 and Jamie Carragher did some good games especially in UCL, but his best game of his life was 2005 UCL final which made him a legend for the club and well deserved, but his biggest problem was the lack of consistency.
Alot of credit needs to go too the camera person having to walk backwards during the interview.
I think people are doing Carragher a bit of disservice, from 05-09. He was as good as anyone.
looking at the title, I thought Van Dijk was talking about Carra being the world's best CB 🤣🤣🤣 How drunk was he...🤣
Well man needs to sort himself out at the min disgraceful this year love the guy as a Liverpool fan he's been a diemend for us but recently poo and man thinks positioning is all you need to do what about blocking the ball ??
World's best CB? LOL Liverpool have one of the worst defenses in the Prem conceding goals like they're giving out candy for Halloween and you call Van Dijk the best CB in the world?
Never forget seeing him at 22 yrs old at Parkhead. We all immediately knew the boy was something special and destined for greatness.
Love The Overlap. Could you do an interview with Ian Rush, Kenny Dalglish, Denis Law, Gary Lineker, Vinnie Jones, Kevin De Bruyne
Cant wait til carragher does the overlap with maguire
15:49  La question sur Giroud
Carra gets in all day other 3 are overrated
I love Gary as a presenter and interviewer as much as I disliked him as a player. This was such a good interview! Really enjoyed it.
We need some goals from you Virgil,  I want 10 before end of season, do it! do it !
You should do an interview for mo salah pls and pls ban the word 'most important thing'for mo salah
he sounds like the terminator hahahaha
Two class acts.
van disney
Carra was absoulote imense for liverpool. Harsh call
The interview no one wanted to end
What a man 👏👏
He is calm and looks a honest  guy bravo
This clown is not the world's best centrehalf and never has been he had maybe 2 or 3 good seasons, that's it
Carragher walks into the starting 11 alongside VVD. Anyone who suggests otherwise is a moron.
Carragher would be in the team...
Jordan pickford can burn in hell. such a scum bag person and player for injuring such a top bloke
1 of the best CB in the world what a player he really works hard to get that title 💯💪
Why does he have to shout the ads
Listened to the whole interview cause Virgil is huge claaaaaassssss. Txixi was ready to pay £70 but not £75 can't say we fumbled cause we have four in the last five prems . But dude is a beast
Once again another great episode on the overlap! 👏☝️
This has made me really respect Virgil alot more. What a man
30:40... Did VVD say, 'Maybe you're shit'? 😂😂
You don't need to be tall to be able to jump high or be good at heading a ball. Cannavaro, Cordoba, W.Samuel, F. De Boer, Ayala, Baresi none of these players were tall. Lisandro Martinez reads the game well, is composed and has plenty of controlled aggression. These are the attributes you need.
is that his garden
I think everyone has to say something about someone in England so so true
Great player and what a humble interview from Van Dijk! Fantastic from Neville!
don't disrespect Carra mate
Big Virg what a charasmatic, cool, calm and collected guy thank God he plays for Liverpool YNWA!
Wot
The height difference
Hey guys... who knows in which park they are filming ? Nice place
Absolutely loved every minute of this.
Unfortunately, based on current form, Carragher beats the lot of them - including Virgil.   I love the loyalty to his teammates, but he's clearly wrong here. Carra is heads and shoulders above Gomez. Konate hasn't really proved himself yet but should one day be a beast. Debatable whether Matip is better or not. Carra easily makes the squad, debatable whether he's in the XI.  (All of our CBs are clearly top players, but Carra gets disrespected far too easily)
I'd love to see an interview with Sir Alex, Wenger, Jose and Rafa Benitez. It could be separately with each of them, but I think it would be very interesting and insightful to see them all together and to learn about their different approaches and philosophies, as well as how they viewed each others teams and prepared for the games. Gary has proved himself as a great host so far, with very thoughtful questions and, which is more important, he is a good listener. Still, it would be a big task, but in my opinion he'd be up for it.
Good insight interview but over rated in my eyes
Lucky to have the colossus at LFC. I know for a fact that once he's done with football, he'll become a good content host. Natural charisma, very funny on the LFC youtube channel when he's hosting. One I vividly remember was on top of the UCL winning bus, he was interviewing Gini and Gomez about their victory, and at the end, he does a, "Back to you guys in the studio..", had everyone in stiches! It was like a 90's throwback television line.. Love VvD!
van dijk knows carra's a wanker since he spat on that girl
Great interview Gaz really enjoyed it , not bad for a Greenmount / Elton lad .
He's right -- everyone in England has something to say about anyone ....
Comes across as a decent guy, proper down to earth.
2005 ,I was in the 7th grade. I supported Liverpool cause of my dad to be honest but in 2005. I can say my love for Liverpool came alive. Carragher played with cramp and literally would of died for this Club in extra time. He might not be urls guy but for us. "We all dream of a team of Carraghers" Ynwa
We need c.ronaldo also in this program And don't worry gary He is no problem of you for that blanked😁😁😁
He’s our number 4
Jaime Carragher would def. make the team if not start, talk about disrespectful of a true Liverpool legend that had a ton of heart. He would have been yelling at the whole lot with the way they performed this year.
Damn they massacred Carra 🤣
Where was this episode recorded?
VAN DIJK IS THE CB  IN THE WORLD  HE'S WON  CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 🏆 UEFA SUPER CUP 🏆  CLUB WORLD CUP 🏆 PREMIER LEAGUE 🏆 CARABO CUP 🏆 FA CUP 🏆 FA COMMUNITY SHIELD 🏆 HE'S WON 7 TROPHYS  🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
The worlds best CB? Lol.
VVD❤️❤️❤️❤️🇮🇳
Come to smaller places lads please. Nev, I hated you as a player, but damn you're a great pundit #ynwa
“I could listen to this all day” 🤣
carra may not be as technically and physically gifted as virg but he was falling and diving and throwing himself out there that passion is what maybe our team lacks at this moment
He's not the best CB in the world anymore lol, this year he isn't even top 10
Wow! Best centre back in the Prem? Not this season he isn't. The media bias is real!!  The same people who used to use stats to prove their point, well they ain't using them this season in regards to Van Djik.....that's for certain
Staright talker- good lad 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼. Still a dream to have him as our center back! 💪🏽
Man City need VVD.  He would have won more and city would have won   CL
Pickford should have been sent off for that assault on VVD Please he is back. I believe it takes 2 years to recover an acl
Liverpool desperately need someone as consistent as Carragher in defense this season!
Excellent interview with refreshingly honest answers
The mutual respect for De Bruyne around the world by players is crazy. Obviously the fans rave about him but that question from Gary over who else you'd love to play with I have seen asked to so many players and almost everyone says KDB
Great interview! Appreciate Virgil opening up about his journey through recovery and taking care of his mental health.
This should be a weekly thing
What a guy big Virgil is man, even as a United fan I love him. Seen him before he ended up down south playing for Celtic he always had it great too see him doing what he’s done
Van Disney 😅😅that's a joke , bring on the butcher 🔪🩸
This is wrong and unfair to Carragher.  Carragher sweat blood and tears for Liverpool. Van D. should be ashamed for saying this. This is despicable. SHAME ON BOTH OF YOU for berating Carragher like that. He had more heart than both of you put together. SHAME on you.  Never had much respect for Van Dyck anyway. Petty and cocky human being. He deserves to be humbled.  Neville, I can understand. He's always been a despicable human being.
Quality man and player, great interview.
Love overlap and what a great interview and vvd seems like a very nice humble down to earth man I think everyone like him
Love your jacket at the beginning and end re: the Overlap on the road.  When did you start as a beekeeper?
As a mixed race, Dutch, Liverpool celtic and Southampton fan, not really a fan of him.
Big Virg is a sound guy
One of the best CB in the modern game of football. A calm leader who is rallying the current Liverpool team.  Probably the only one who could be compared to the great Paolo Maldini.
Mr Qatar, The Champagne Socialist.
Why do people need to comment   “As a Liverpool fan”  Or “Being a Dutchman”   Just comment! We don’t need to know sexuality and what part of the world you come from
Gary Neville, the ultimate left wing socialist. Get him off sky
The best CB to ever do it. Transformed LFC from the second the pic of him infront of the christmas tree went up. Hero on Merseyside.
Carra will be fuming
as a liverpool fan unfortunately for us  this season virgil certainly isn"t the best cb in the world
I am a life long  Swedish hardcore Liverpool fan but... as much as i love my Liverpool and Virgil, this year he has been to defensive and not involved in the attacking side wish is a must if you wanna be the best in the world in that pos, sure the whole team has been off for one reason or another but. Am i wrong?
I need, I MEAN NEED after this week the CR7 overlap make it happen
This guy has the most impressive, natural charisma to him. Confident but incredibly chill. Also very polite. You get the feeling that you will get all the respect and decency from him, but you'd never want to mess with him, and he makes you feel that without giving you the attitude. He is the less comedian-like version of Ibra, and the less obnoxious version of Sergio Ramos.
I've got a bit of a man crush on virg I can't lie
cool :)
Ironically VVD would make great punditry
G Nev having to make new friends now that Ronaldo’s not talking to him anymore 😂😂😂
Get trent on this Gary
Carra would make the team easy. Aside from Milner and Robbo, there is nobody in the team with that steely aggression and a will to die for the cause. And not too shabby ability-wise, his reading of the game was supremely underrated. Made 700+ appearances without being too strong or quick.
Wierd liverpool haters they pretend like liverpool weren't 11th with 8 games the season before last were only 12 games ago they played in cl final begging amongst eachother to hope that liverpool are suddenly bad when they just schooled city and halland with ease so lazy by them theg got diaz and jota back after WC and a January transfer window and clearly have better and more winners than arsenal city spurs Chelsea United
Celtic one of biggest clubs in world 🤣🤣🤣. Love VVD and his rise to the top, but Scottish football is dead in the water
Celtic made Liverpool legends  VVD 🍀
KDB in Liverpool team would be illegal. Crazy too that as a Liverpool fan he's been one of the main reasons City have beat them to it many times lol
The worlds best CB  😂🤣
Not the best cb anymore is he, the butcher has taken that title from him now 🔪💪
Overlap on tour? Only one date and location, not much of a tour 😂
Arsenal fan, but was waiting for this. Class guy
It’s crazy how we missed out on this guy although he was linked to United even before moving to Southampton
12:48 did he really do that😏
Another great episode. Didn’t think I’d like VVD as a Utd fan but hard to dislike him with his quality and seems genuine from this conversation
One word to describe Virgil Van Dijk : Elegance
13:00
Class act on and off the pitch. YNWA🇮🇪🇮🇪
Gary neville socks just like loserpool and van dick
One of GOAT of the modern game!!#LiverpoolFC #YNWA 👍❤️ Great interview!!
An overlap with Thierry Henry would slap
Is Gary going to have Cristiano on anytime soon? That would be interesting 🍿
not even in top 3 best in epl today
Will these be available as a podcast?
Where is it filmed ?
These contents are too good for YouTube
Great Footballer🔝
He’s such a class lad, everything about him is so cold and calm
Hes not the best cb though. Not even close.
Pound for pound the best CB the Prem has ever seen. Whilst he doesn’t yet have the longevity of Terry & Rio, he still has years at the top. Comes across very well also. Great interview!
Love Virgil and maybe has a point about Carra struggling in today’s era, but the current Liverpool side could do with some of his passion given the lackadaisical performances we’ve witnessed recently
I remember shouting at Virgil at stoke, during the end of his time at Southampton. We won and I was mocking his reported price tag. It didn't age well did it! Fantastic player.
brilliant, top bloke too
Best line in the entire interview: @11:16 :"I think in England everyone has to say something about everyone..." 😂😂😂 Spot on!
Vvd looking every bit of q Southampton player but saying that Cara who played so many games against best vvd did it 3,4 years and now his usless and thinking Gomez them are better lmao
I saw 'worlds best centre back' and thought you were interviewing Lisandro Martinez. Sorry
Very smart and huble guy. Could watch them two for hours.
Hahah get in the bin Carragher. Not only has VVD slagged of your playing ability.. but he’s also rubbished your punditry on Martinez. Scouse bastard😂😂
Love hearing stories like Giroud being his bogeyman. Very underrated striker.
6:20
VVD is the GOAT, honestly, outstanding defender
KDB will always pick VVD, and VVD will always pick KDB. They’ve both got massive respect for each other.
thats why Ronaldo didnt go on and everyone kicked off
neville is obsessed with Carra
Anybody know where this was filmed?
Every time gary neville introduces himself im expecting him to follow up with something like, 'Hi everyone, I bet you never thought youd be watching me'
VVD is a quality CB no doubt.. but best modern day CB in the last 10 years has been Ramos for me, not many people like him but he's won everything and scored a decent amount aswell 😂
36 minutes? Noooo!! More Gary! More more more
Jeez Virg is a honest man. Tells you how he feels no messing.
VVD needs to get his groove back because he has been horrible this season, and he plays best with Konate not Gomez.
Gary has been brilliant with Overlap show, certainly this is of my most enjoyable interviews 💕💕 it
Liverpool i PL atm anyone can join
Neville is a legend as a pundit and this Overlap .... As  a player don't think so
This is what Elite looks like!!!
So easy to forget he’s Dutch his English is so good and he really understands English banter/sense of humour
What an arguably the best center back in the Premier league. Van Dijk is truly a remarkable player and  has been an immense force in the Liverpool squad and in his football career. This is the best Overlap interview I have heard so far.
He isn't the best cb, right this moment he looks shit
I find it interesting Van Dyk rates Konate. Sure he is a good defender but always looks like hes on the verge of a mistake. I think Carra would start ahead of Konate.  Carra could read the game better then Konate.
What a joke, not even best centre half in Merseyside, his defensive stats are awful
I think he admires Man City a lot. His eyes when he is talking about KDB and Foden are in awe
Love listening to Virgil seems a nice honest guy hope he does well in the world cup for Netherlands
Love his comment on Newcastle
Fuck me he chooses Yap Stam and not Franz Beckenbauer ? Naive !
Not the worlds best cb though is he
Whoa 😱 ... This 👆 is just  " E.P.I.C. " ... Haaland jumping around so horribly much b4 the trip to Anfield n when it came to actual DIRECT head 2 head, the boy don't get a sniff ... Bringin sexy back to the art of defending 4rm the past 4+ years  💯 ..
Class from VVD. YNWA
Great interview from Mr. Qatar
@Virgil Van Dyke definitely along with Alison and Fabinho, made us a well better team and Klopp done amazing to see the potential and get these players, @Liverpool F.C give Klopp some more money please, to go again !!!!
11:46 A direct message to the management & FSG
Why do we need vvd's opinion on the England team? And as the final question as well?
11.16 great answer. And sadly true
At this moment in time, Gary is a hypocrite.
worlds best ? what for 2 seasons or forever? Virgil is a great defender & good luck to him... He is in the top list but Im sure several clubs would put forward a decent candidate over the years, im a City fan but surely Gary played with a couple of CB's as good as or better than virgil ? and i think Kompany is up there in that list for the decade or so he lead our club up a great road...  and who was that italian.. ?? Maldini Besides all that.. Gary has become a great pundit & its always good to see players opinions & personalities.
Its always ur best mates😂😂😂😂why Gary doing Jamie like this
I know every club fan loves their greats and rates them ahead in some cases but you can't belittle his accomplishments and his talent.  Virgil is exactly what you'd want in a CB.  And like Drogba a super late bloomer.  Love this interview.  Awesome interview and as much as it pains me to say it, Gary loves the game and all of his analysis right and wrong tends to be on time.  He loves real footballers and this made all the sense in the world.
Top man and world class player.
van Dijk is nowhere near the best CB in the world. Not even in top 10 the past year or more.
As a fan of a rival club, I announce this fact to beg likes and show myself as totally impartial and amazing
I do think Carra is better than all of the rest
Why is Gary shouting at me?
To be fair, at this moment in time, unbelievable, like you wouldn't believe.
The world's best what now?
He was never the worlds best cb 😂  Very good player, yes. But nowhere near prime varane, ramos. He was lucky to be in the top 5 in his prime.
“Whenever it suits him” Naa carras alright
Such a brilliant watch this👍🏻
Iam red fan but thank you 😊 Gary Neville for the video 📹
Never liked him before, but after watching how he talks bad about Carragher, i'm fully on board!
To think people criticise VVD to perform how he has after that injury is amazing. Every player has bad games and has a period of bad form. In this social media era its easy to criticise and comment and put players down.
gary neville at virgils height would actually be a mean cb
He's been criticized this season and some of it is of course justified but I'm sure it doesn't help when Fabinho looks like he's suffering from burnout, people keep running through the midfield like butter at times so everything is on you and not having Matip or Konaté there doesn't help. Not saying he didn't deserve a lot of the criticism but it's not all on him.
Hes not even in the top 10, let alone best centre back about.
I was never sold on Carragher as a right back, but he was a brilliant centre back. I think people who aren't old enough to have seen him just look at the Henry clips and think that kind of thing often happened, which it didn't. He was rarely exposed, while his timing of tackles and the way he read the play was top class. He was undoubtedly good enough to be in there.
Virgil doesn’t like Carra 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Well, we are all awaiting Carra's response to that one🤣🤣
Very overrated cb. He’d just be a bog standard defender 10-15 years ago
is now a bad time to ask for an episode with jordan pickford
VVD is a pretty funny dude...this was an enjoyable interview.
As vvd said 26:17 we’re gonna get u or we don’t get anyone shows how stubborn Klopp is and dat wen we tried to get tchouameni and we didn’t he didn’t want no one else
No matter how good you are, who the fuck do you think you are disrespecting Carra like that. Won 1 league title look at the fucking cockiness ! Bottlejob
Legend ❤
Does it go on tour to Qatar too? Since your a big advocate
Jamie getting a stick hahaha
Enjoyed this one! What a guy! ❤
Is there a reason virgil doesn’t like carra or is it banter 😂
Neville definitely enjoyed the Carragher part😂😂😂😂😂,honestly Virgil is right Carragher was a shit center back & if you watch him roast other current defenders you'd imagine he was like Rio Ferdinand or Kompany type of a defender
Loved this!!
He’s def thinking about not getting injured cos his performances have been dogshit
Carragher needs to react to this.
Ur on 200k a week ffs grow a pair . Try living in real world
A spurs fan I believe he’s not the same player he was after his injury but, at his peak is the best defender the premier league has ever seen.
World best cb 🤣😅🤣 2 season wonder
Who is the best cb? mannequin challenge Virgil!
Carragher would fucking walk into that squad.
He’s not the worlds best centre back Jesus he was good for 9 months , get real
Giroud is actually a decent shout in answer to his question. I always said that he's an underrated player. The criticism levelled at him I heard when he was at Arsenal was that he's not a "20 goal a season striker" but you can still bet he'll score.
He’s not the worlds best centre back Jesus he was good for 9 months , get real
GIROUD? Bogie man? HAHAHAAH
no matter how hard use try. use will never be open goal
Great interview, a well balanced young man, and it’s refreshing to hear that he enjoys playing his sport even though under a lot of outside pressures ….. top man …!
He's our centre half....
Re comments on Carragher. Maybe not the most technically gifted of players but in terms of raw desire and commitment you couldn't ask for more. Something  LFC might be missing right now.
The Carragher comment has made Gary’s year! 😂
Seems a right prick does Van Dijk
Virgil is the world best even though he and his club team are not on a great run bt individually i would give it to him
I rate this guy's honesty, seems like exactly the type of person you'd want to work with.
Ronaldo on next ye? 😂
He is not the world's best CB. The propaganda machine that just asserts who is the best, is astounding
Love the overlap its quality.  This episode brilliant great questions from Gary and VVD comes across brilliantly.
Hey Gary, do Ronaldo next 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
0:40 the moment where VVD became Gary's favourite player😂
Gary Neville speaks like he hasn’t won everything 😅
What an absolute legend.
Beautiful farm and scenery.
We need a Jamie Carragher reaction video to this
Great time for this to come out after him losing his first home league game.
As a Dutch Liverpool fan I really loved this interview. Gary is a great man, we won’t forgot what he did for the real football fans against the Super League.
Van dijk was the best CB in the world for 2 years but hes fallen off a cliff in recent times
In the car park 😂
he won every club level trophies except Europa League…. not many had done that…..🤭🫡🤫🫶🏻🙌🏻
He's a top bloke though whoever you support, seems so normal
Worlds best centre back? Bit late for that mate
So many ppl telling him he’s the best and I’d have Sami hyppia or carra all day before him
Loved this.   Honestly love Carra, but I'd agree, but, same with Neville, they'd struggle with the modern game  Respect the he doesn't brown nose past players, says it how it is.
Anyone hear the cheeky link he wants to join the toon...
Is this old? Van Dijk has been shocking this season.  Apologies didn't realise it was from LFC TV.
At 12:50 how VVD not said mitro is outrageous must have him still rattled crazy
Bro is majestic
This was great but Carra walks onto that starting lineup in Gomez’s place.
"Worlds best cb?" This video must've been shot 2 years ago. 😂
Been a great for the scousers, but he's on the way down now. Shadow of the player he was.
Ffs vigil is nowhere near best CB in the world
Hahaha😂 Jamie will be at the stands ouch
Would be nice to see ronaldo on the overlap 🤣🤣🤣
As a Liverpool fan, I can’t help but say the overlap series is one of the best on YouTube. Gary Neville as a player I couldn’t stand him, but off the pitch he seems like a genuine, funny person. His values and what he stands for I respect. Another top ep with VVD. I love how we see a different side to him because he hardly does interviews. I’m crying VVD and Gary came together for carra slander😆Keep the content coming Gary
Maybe we should have put virgil in our most recent video instead 🤔
Wow he just two footed Carragher 🤣🤣🤣
I watched this for VVD and not for Neville the woke hypocrite. The mug had gone from a hero to a zero in my book.
He's by far the most boring person they have had on the overlap so far
Lol. He did Carra wrong man.
That’ll be carragher spitting on his car next time he pulls up at the lights
Van Dijk to win World Cup
What about little Virgil?
My CB 💯🤌🏼
Bring Cristiano on the overlap 🥶
watched 18/19 and 19/20 when he played 38/38 league games twice and can confirm how much GIroud gave virgil tough times, i don't even think there's any other guy in the world that won two three aerial battles against VVD per game and as he said he scored many times
Geweldig interview. Virgil is klasse
Great banter but carra would’ve been a starter most likely would’ve been your partner but virg
The most overrated centre back in the history of football very average 2 great seasons that’s it
Just clocked Virg has a line up waves and a manbun lol
Will never be a Premier League great like Terry, Rio, Vidic or Kompany. He takes every second season off.
VVD the man who changed anfield💥👊
Surprised he said Giroud is his best opponent considering he said Aguero before
It's a shame his form has fallen off a cliff
Played against some of the best strikers in 2010s (most of them in their prime) and he chose Giroud as his best opponent, no one would expected that, underrated striker
🤣
Carragher could play right back, behind the changing rooms
Everyone laughs at G Nevs Valencia record… yet Gerrard had a lower win percentage at Villa, will probably walk into another job sometime soon and not get the same abuse. Strange 🤷
World best CB? don't make me laugh what about Ruben Dias, Marquinhos, David Alaba?
It's about time Overlap!
“Worlds best CB” 😂😂😂
Here before Liverpool fans (cultists) pour in and use fire emojis.
ooooh Virgil friends. Bin.
How can you not love big Virgil man… so much class about him
Great player, but one of the most irritating and hypocrite people in football.
Here that  “19th league title” still don’t understand people saying we’ve only won the league once cause of the name change😂🤦‍♂️
Please do an Overlap in Qatar whilst you are lining your pockets.....
Maybe some subtitles would be nice
