2025 Anyone 😂
He gains more strength each kill 💀💀😁😁
The fact that he continues to carry around USED KITCHEN KNIVES and we're supposed to pretend they're the sharpest knives in existence? Have we ever in 40 years seen him sharpen a knife? No?
I love the electric guitar Halloween theme in this trailer
Terrible movie they had a chance to make a great sequel and failed
I always saw kitchen knives normal, after Halloween 1 released. Any time I saw kitchen knives I would always get reminded: “ you can’t kill the boogey man “
Uh oh.😮😮😮😮😮
Happy 4th Anniversary Halloween Kills October 15th 2021 Rated MA 15 Rated R
I just finished watching Halloween. I didn't think slashers could be this fun.😂 And how ridiculous is, that she covered her house in traps just to kill Michael just to find out, the firefighters are just gonna come and save the guy.😂
They should have ended Michael Myers after the second one All the rest of them suck H2O wasn't too bad  what a waste of time
Lori is the same woman a sister of Michael Myers two babysitters Tommy Doyle & Lindsey both them 💕 happy Halloween party there is the astronaut play scream 👀 The Boogeyman inside 🏠
Send in the avengers😅 imagine Thor or Ironman against Micheal
Why they didn’t use this “LET IT BURN!” In the actual movie I’ll never know. The anger in her voice.
Charles 'Chick' Chapple, Reg Slivko, Maggie Lang
Halloween kills movie is the scariest  movie in the world  michael Myers is the scariest  monster in the world i love this  movie it's my favorite  movie
Music is terrible
This one is a stinker
Glad they didn't give anything away in the trailer.
I ❤ Michael Myers.
Halloween ends dont exist that was a bad dream all of us had
This was a good horror movie.
0:14 Literally my reaction when I first saw this trailer.
HALLOWEEN 🎃🖤
Sigh. Trailer turned out to be better than the movie. Oh well.

Not as good as halloween 5
1:43
The trailer for this movie was SO good. And the 2018 film. Both top tier, couldn't be more excited and then this came out...and Halloween Ends. If you like the movie, I 100% get it, there is stuff in H:Ends that I did like but it didn't have that same excitement, energy and anticipation as the first two did. Not sure where the flow went wrong for me. I'll always love the 2018 movie though. Great way to have him comeback.
This movie was so garbage
Worst ending and worst movie without proper conclusion
🔝❤️

6:13 am march 5th 2025
I’m about to watch this movie for the first time
It’s awful..
This trailer is one of the best movie trailers ever and the film just doesn’t live up to it. It reminds me of the Star Wars sequels. Amazing trailers terribly written movies
💀✌🏻
Damm that LET IT BURNNN line at the beginning really gave an insight to how Micheal really was that EVIL .

I don't get why people dislike the movie from Halloween Kills. Of course, Halloween Ends Ruin is a single movie Because the only thing that hit hard was Halloween kills
50 years, I still remember that I predicted this video in 2021.   *EVIL DIES TONIGHT*
I searched for this just to leave this comment:  ENOUGH with these 'Halloween' movies, they're stoopid (had to spell it that way because YouTube's feelings get hurt otherwise) and just flat-out tired and goofy. There will be 8 clowns running away from just one clown who is chasing them by WALKING! Why can't the 8 clowns just all gang up on him and kill him? Or tie him up and detain him at the very least! Ridiculously unrealistic movie. Wanna make a truly scary movie? Stick with $**t that can actually happen.
America serial killer in flim: Chainsaw, Sharp knife, hammer... Scary face mask..
Michael the only man on earth who doesn't need to take out funeral insurance because he will always exist.
Happy Halloween! 🎃🦇👻🕷️💀
it was so stupid to try to kill him by burning the house, soooo stupid😂
This is where Michael's fun begins
I just watched and loved it!!! Oh wow. The cast is perfection. So good!
Beautiful dedication to Halloween 3 season of the witch
I wish the title card came out right after this in the movie!  0:12 "LAURIE: No no no no! LET IT BURN!!!" (Title card)  And the theme sounds more like this 1:26 Orchestral version
If Micheal ran the movie would be over in like 30 min

The one character they should’ve added Jimmy ( actor Lance Guest) the paramedic from Halloween 2 who survived.  Because the film brought past characters.  He would’ve been a good fit.

the fact that this was a REAL burning building is amazing

Stupidest freaking movie ever. They shot him like twenty times, stabbed like twenty times and still defeated the entire police and fire department and killed half of the towns people.
Should have been the last instead of ends
Laurie thinking she killed Micheal   The firefighters saving him from from the fire not realizing it was Micheal 😤
This trailer spoiled everything tbh
I hate that movie
Universal Pictures, MiraMax & Blumhouse Productions Presents Halloween Kills
This is one of those trailers that practically shows the whole movie. 🤷🏾‍♀🙄
I don’t care if this movie and ends were poorly written, I loved both of them
O filme é UMA BOSTA
He after Michel myers by movie knife in who person why bad you're    Laurie hospital take care
Best movie ever still till this day
2026: *Halloween Lives On*
So we will never get another movie? It’s over?😢 someone HAS to do it right!
Pa cundo otra película de Halloween están bien perronas.👌🏻
“A man couldn’t have survived that fire, the more he kills, the more he transcends, he’s the essence of evil.” The next movie: push the fridge on Michael and put a couple knifes in him. Yup, that'll do it.
This trailer is over 3 years old...
Published on 11 Jun 2026
Absolutely crap. The worst film I have ever watched, and by a long way. The story, the screenplay, the acting, everything is terrible.

How did Michael Myers survived in a burning house
I watched the full movie and the ending was crazy,like I thought the actually killed Michael,but a killer always comes back🫣
“LET IT BURN!!!” 😂🤣💥 0:14
3 years later and I still can't get over the fact that they attacked Michael Myers like a party of turn-based Final Fantasy characters.
Michael myers needs another movie
The trailer was better than the movie
When is The Halloween Tv Show Coming Out?
I’m happy I’m back watching this trailer
The Firefighter sound like James Lee’s Voice
This trailer soundtrack fire
I wish i Could Sue this movie for how Bad it is. They totally ki|| the real story of Michael 😢
Esse filme é bom? Lançou na Netflix
Never dies😂
The title should be halloween kills coz all peolple are f dumb
2:26
This movie is the evil murder ring with connections to the CIA, the movie DungeonMaster (1984), Steve Ford (Jerry Ford's son) and the New York and Michigan crime and trafficking network. The Ramsey's, too. And the Clinton's Arkansas Cartel crime, too.
FUCKING STUPID MOVIE FUCKKKK!
"The following preview has been approved" screen 📺 [Red 🟥]: Halloween 🎃 Kills 🔪 (2021) - Rated R ❤️
If you’ve seen this movie then the first thing you should do is not try selling this at the car boot it’s that bad…. How can a cop not be able to catch Mike after being less than2 feet away from him also his shooting ability is bad (should be fired) 💩 💩 💩 rating!..
فيلم رائع احببته من البداية الى النهاية انصح الجميع بان يشاهدوه لمن يعشقون الرعب
Halloween kills is a more updated verison of halloween 5 the revenge of Michael myers. He shows no mercy just like in Halloween 5 when eveyrone thought rachel was gonna be safe but he killed her and in Halloween kills you didn't think karem was capable of being killed off until Michael showed up behind her and, bam! Not to mention michael legit kills half a town in Halloween kills
The franchise should’ve ended with Halloween 2018. Laurie was finally ready for him to come and he did, and she beat him. It was a perfect conclusion, a closed loop. But this movie opened that loop and finished the franchise on an embarrassment of a Halloween movie
Just saw the movie. OMG! The trailer spoiles EVERYTHING! 😂😂😂
my favorite one
Man of few (to no) words
2 years and the Violin theme still slaps🔥
Allyson’s cute af
What happened to her son??? Did they change it to daughter??? Why??
Just watched it. After being pleasantly surprised by Halloween 2018, what a let down this was. Maybe has the most stupid characters in the history of slasher films. So stupid, they deserved having Michael get them. Is Halloween Ends even worth watching?
Comedy.. such a childish thinking.. those group of man beating him like crazy and also policeman shooting him still he is alive😅😅😅... I know it's a movie but it's such stupid to watch.
💩💩💩💩
It’s the guy from Fortnite!!!! 😱
Sorry  but the old school Halloween movies are 10x better. They should had stopped producing these films after the early 00s..
This really is the worst film I’ve ever seen. It’s shockingly awful.
Pandemic didn’t make anything good
1:44 got chills by their chant
Este trailer prometía tanto…
The guy from Fortnite.
Looking back they really gave the best parts away in the trailer all other kills in the movie are off screen anyway
Crazy of how a whole town is at the hospital against Michael. Never seen that in a horror movie. He even took down a whole town! Made them scared for their life’s and made the people OOF themselves!
This did not make sense b/c the inmate that they were after could not have been MM, this man was way too frail and short to be MM.
I am re watching this and I just realized that little john and big john were gay, I thought they were father and son.
i just comming looking for the song by Ghost, where is?
stupid movie and stupid people, no logic at all like the policeman stopped another policeman from killing Jason Myers , also the people know at the end of the movie, who goes after a serial killer with baseball bats and one handgun like why 😂😅, stupid stupid movie ,  no one aimed at his neck or head like he does with his victims , like seriously though
Jamie Lee Curtis will forever be the nation’s Scream Queen. She’s absolutely thrilled to just be a part of all this chaos.
0:34 That part seems like a Kung Fu Movie, well, Michael is somewhat of a skilled Martial Artist!!!
Michael myers can't die like Jason Warheas, Freddie Kruger
Wow Hollywood was so brave to do a movie like this during the worldwide pandemic when there is so many health very strict restriction.
Man I'm gonna watch it on Netflix it looks kinda exciting and interesting at the sametime.
this movie is a trash
That “LET IT BURN!” Gave me chills
The scene where Michael kills the firefighter with chainsaw, is it a sign to say Michael could possibly kill the famous Texas chainsaw killer ( LEATHER FACE )
Sad to see Michael Myers go. This movie must have been on a very low budget. It was poorly made and scripted. I wanted to walk out the theatre with the first 15 mins.
The boy Cameron really lacked any type of testosterone or masculinity, not unlike today’s youth. As such, he  really was no match for Michael, and Michael made short work of him.
This movie sucks so bad I didn't bother watching the trailer until just now, and yep, it's worse. Jamie Lee is a hack.
This was the worst thing I’ve ever seen. I love Michael Myers but this ain’t it. It’s actually unwatchable
This horror franchise is sure bringing in the moolah 💰💵  Its shocking how many of us are interested in Michael Myers serial killer/ pyschopath. Much like "SCREAM"/its all about slasher movies - violence sells
I see that movie is Great.
So stupid thye shoots him many time and they cant killl him so stupid
I like this movie to fun and scary too
Halloween 🎃 Kills 🔪 (2021) happened on the month 🗓️ of October 🦇👻🎃💀🕷️🧙‍♀️.❤️
Im soo excited fore second part in  next Sunday ❤ i love this 1 part
Oh yeah ima roast the heck out of Michael 😅
My favorite Halloween toed with 1981
When the trailer is better than the actual movie 😔
Was decent until Halloween ends which was total garbage!! I'll stay with the originals. Cult of Thorn still better than Halloween Ends!!
Credit to the dude who attacked Michael with the saw, he was trying to get the achievement.
These movies of Michael Myers is getting so old, boring and dumb but the fascination of some Americans with him still today is even more unbelievable 😂 The actors in this movie were horrible, the pathetic dialogues ewww so cliché. I love Hollywood movies but this never dying Michael Myers of them  makes me puke now. No more of him again. Jamie i ❤ you though
Someone should have push the fire alarm when we were 30mins into it. This movie was so full of ##$^&. How was it that Jamie decided to act in this corny crap??? Blows my mind. Worst movie I've seen in my entire life
Carnt kill what's already dead
The only good part in this movie was when Judy Greer gets killed
0:36
hellio
A very raw and brutal movie 🥺 He's the essence of evil 🙄  Michael Myers 😎
I miss movie this
this should of been the final movie lol
This movie was cringy AF! So much exaggeration and so many BAD actors!👎🏽🤮 The previous Halloween movies were so much better but the 2007 film with Tyler Mane as Michael Myers was my favorite. He was bad AF 🖤😎💀
Everyone with a gun misses ? Come on this is shit,he gets a pitchfork in the back and gets up nooo😂
why's he kinda..
I don't like creepy, disgusting things, blood, dead body, death, killing. Makes me uncomfortable. There is too much fear in reality. I like tv that can feel I can escape from reality.
Where are you
True
0:29 Michael looks so badass here
1:42
I hate Halloween ends
they literally show the entire fckn movie in the trailer..
I just want to write that my name is  Josh and i want to write that on Sunday March 12, 2023 Jamie Lee Curtis won the academy award for best supporting actress for his role in the film Everything Everywhere All at Once. Jamie Lee Curtis has now won an academy award. clips of her winning the academy award are on youtube.
After covid 19 is over halloween kills finally released
>
2:16
I wish that eerie music that played while he walked out of the burning house was on the soundtrack
when at the beginning Michael came out i literally got hyped 😂😂😂
Am I the only one that is still wondering whatever happened to Laurie's son John Tate from the H20 movie!? Was there something that I missed from one of the movies that explained what happened to him? 🤔🤷🏻‍♂️❓
I hate when you put black people in my movies ..... it's so perverted to see black actors mixing with white actors
Michael Myers=MM=33 jewmasonry
Don't look!!!!!!!!!!
00
Bullshit
Sranje
So he literally kabobed a fireman and tossed him away like trash, but gets his ass handled by some dorky kid?
Good Movie! But they went about trying to kill Myers the wrong way. You can't just beat him down or shoot him. Instead, once u surround him get him on the ground & drench him in gasoline, then light him on fire. Then BEFORE he gets up u need to cut him to multiple pieces using chainsaws. Then incinerate the pieces in an industrial oven. 😎
its sound Karen says do you want your math
This shit is a joke already not even scary anymore so fukkng predictable is not even funny. They should really start remaking other movies that have gotten forgotten bout.
This movie was made to make a spin off.. Went to war with a whole town and  fire department  but one guy took his mask..
I hope those people are ok…
RIP firemen

OMG this movie is lit man  definitely watch this guys (on prime) ⚡loved it
This is gonna be real fun
no matter how fast you run michael walks and strolls faster
the film is wonderful
I don’t know why people hate this so much… I liked it
Halloween (2018) Halloween Kills (2021) Halloween Ends (2022)
1:07 When he said Michael is alive, I got goosebumps! 🎃🗡️
That firefighter had balls of steel for Facing Michael Fucking Myers!
This was my favorite movie out of the David Gordon Green and John Carpenter trilogy
I always wondered who would win...between Michael and Jason
The Music is Fucking Perfect
Why wasn't I able to watch this part in Germany? I watched Halloween ends and I was confused that I missed a part... hmmmm
1:22 Great line, hope it's not said a million FUCKING times
Can't believe JLC signed up for this. So damn cheesy.  Especially the one before this, hes one guy with a knife, shes trained almost all her life also her daughter and they got a basement full of rifles and shotguns and a guy with a knife is going after them, it doesn't get any easier than that. Just fkn sit back relax in a corner and wait for him to come. Or hell, theres three of them just go look for him, once he jump on one just point blank blast him away, thats why i find it so stupid The second one which is this one is even more stupid.  Its like sarah connor/walking dead/3 gi janes
He can not die Michael myers can die sometimes but not for long he is so scary
How can this guy survive
I would just call up the US Military
I absolutely hate this movie I have hated all movies prior to this one even Jason which is just like Michael Myers they seem like the same dude to me but when it comes to Freddy Krueger that dude is cool as hell but if you don't wanna be scared watch this crap I mean it is dumb as hell so corny so stupid so slow and not scary at all
its aight
Not a bad film, Definitely not a masterpiece, but tbh it’s a fun watch, and Michael was such a badass in this movie. The fact they went from this to Halloween ends is such a mindfuck
Hands down the most gruesome one in the Halloween series
Nice

😅😅😅😅 whats up with all these black people  in this  movie 🤣🤣🤣 Comptonfield IL
If only Michael was this brutal in Halloween ends!
I'm watching this now and I am piss at how ridiculous it is but I can't stop watching 😅 😳 🤣 he killed a whole squad/battalion of fireman!! He walks faster than hussein bolt runs and he repels bullets 😅😅😅😆😆😆🤭😵‍💫🥱🥱
If i was infront of michael  myres when he was comming out of the house i would had shitted my pants
Probably the worst closing act to a movie I've seen in my fifty years on  this planet. I shit you not.  Absolutely the most dreadfully dumdum brained crap I've ever seen.
shieeet
Where's Josh Hartnett lol
Michael in his ''berserker mode'', a deadly and crazed mob mentality in Haddonfield, more deaths, panic and revelations from the past, another good bloody chapter of this fear filled saga.
Michael Myers fights the most inept group of fuking idiots ever, lol!  The only town in America where hardly no one has a gun. Still a fun movie tho.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
His eyes please 0:33 🤤😭
This was so much more hype than halloween kills holy shit
“Evil dies tonight” No, it really doesn’t
Unwatchable low budget slop.
Movie was good for what it was I guess
i rewatched halloween 2018 and this movie in preparation for halloween ends and i forgot how amazing this movie is.  lots of people dont like this one, but i think its a masterpiece
“Evil does tonight” what a great quote. Surely they won’t overuse it
But Halloween kills..sucks. Bad direction..an wrighters..hope the last one does it justice. Mike's been part of us for 50 years
Lol he should be in the hundred meter for USA Olympics lol..crossing Finnish line with machete raised high lmfao
I hate this one I have been watchin this series sense I was little and this last one is stupid as fuck and confusing because the explanation makes no sense this movie is horrible!
We own this movie a apology...
normal people - gets a stab and became dead. Micheal - got stabbed 100 times gets shot 10 times and still having fun 😂😂
Me to Halloween Kills after watching Halloween Ends: *"Perhaps I treated you too harshly."*
how tf I just learned about this sequel to Halloween 2018??? Someone told me about the new Halloween Ends and I thought this one was the sequel.... Man I missed this one ffs
I am waiting for a new movie of Jason Voorhees
Halloween ends was the worst halloween movie ever, Halloween kills is actually good, they showed a massacre and leaves us with a cliffhanger.
The first 8 installments of this great series are great, but this new one, these three new installments are so boring, without any hold on the viewership. Everyone just got up halfway through the movie and left. Boring. Do not spend money on this movie
Dude they finally gave us a movie where Michael was the main character and it was just badass. It had its flaws but what slasher doesn’t?
This movie was fcking awesome if you just wanna sit back and watch Michael go on a REAL rampage.
Woke bull Sht. Way to go on a good ruined franchise. Glad I didn't pay real money to go watch this sht telling kids stabbed little girls in +!+$
Michael Myers is the definition of plot armor.
Movie was goated can’t wait to watch Halloween ends
This movie literally could have been the final movie. Use this entire movie than add the last 10 minutes of Halloween Ends...BOOM perfect ending.
Who's here after watching Halloween Ends.
half of the movie hes just walking around in the in tunnels and going in and out of man holes   the worse Halloween movie to date , you want to see something better watch Mr. Harrigan’s Phone
I’m not just gonna sit around and let innocent people die……….          Yet, everyone who died were innocent

Halloween Kills is officially 1 year old!!! Didnt get the best reception from fans and critics like the 2018 film  The director has explained his view on his film's criticism arguing that leaving certain plot points "unresolved" was intentional but perhaps not favorable to the audience Green admitted that the final film creates an opportunity to clean up the mess that was left over from the previous movie  CinenaSnob does point out the heavy flaws like the many scenes of speechifying, the legacy characters being illogical,  and going over stuff people already know  But I love this is still the most violent installment in the franchise  A bit of a step down yet  Michael Myers knows no bounds when it comes to killing  Love all the throwbacks to the 1978 movie, I'm amazed they had the gall to reference Halloween II (1981) Lots of ideas about mob mentality, challenging the system, and people coming together as a collective whole to stop the fear and violence shaking them  Not all of it is perfectly wound but John Carpenter, Danny McBride, and David Gordon Green still deliver the thrills  It's not just Laurie Strode's story now, it's the town of Haddonfield's story
I thought this movie was bad, but after seeing Halloween ends it made this movie look like a masterpiece
Awful awful movie. They could have opened it like a flashback like they did in Halloween kills. Where Michael was a kid and u see him leaving for Halloween before killing his sister and his parents r saying goodbye. U see this from the perspective of behind his head. Then u c him say something 2 another kid but never hear it and the kid says no Michael thereby adding mystery. Then he kills his sister. Then it shifts to wen hes a teenager in the mental hospital. Again the perspective is from behind his head and we see sum awesome kills like a nurse getting stabbed in the nose and this is actually wer he gets his first mask which is strikingly similar to his original mask and we get to see teen Michael in a extremely similar looking mask. Then it shifts to the night Karen was apparently murdered and we see from his perspective how he entered the house and how he escaped. Its also revealed that karen just about survived her attack. Then it shifts to present day, a woman carving a pumpkin in present day. The day b4 Halloween. She puts knive on a shelf not noticing it falls. Then she is making decorations for Halloween and spills red paint which goes on the knive. Michael picks this up and it becomes his new improved trademark weapon becoming stained with blood over time. Also near the end of the movie she doesn't just kick his leg and he groans like an old man. She kicks like 3 times in an awesome shot for shot instead. She doesn't impale his hand. She cuts it of leaving him practically unable to kill due to having only 2 fingers. The mob cuts his legs off and burns the wounds. Then wen shes putting him in the grinder he grabs her with his 2 fingers and the sheriff guy shoots him making him fall into the grinder. Much cooler this way and hes alive as hes being chewed up. Also they include karen somehow in parts of the movie. Also Corey shudnt have spoken and just laughed instead. His His laugh was awesome epic and he shud have survived somehow. Theres so much potential they could have done. Flashbacks etc setting up an arc for a story about Michael time in an asylum and how he escaped. Feels like they deliberately made this bad knowing they wud make easy cash because of the previous movies and by doing this its keeping the fans coming back hoping the next reboot is better. Im kinda thinking its almost as bad as resurrection.
Halloween Ends makes this movie look like a classic lol
This is the Shitest movie after the F9 saga… The worst of the worst.. That’s why European thinks American people are stupid, because they are.. To be honest
Lemme guess, there's another Halloween movie after this
why have the police and military not taken him out by now, all those deaths

this should have been halloween ends😢
This one was so fun to watch in theaters and later today I’m going to watch Halloween Ends 😁
After having seen the film, I feel this trailer reveals too much. Great trailer, but basically the entire movie in 2:30
Fhddgsgshdfd🥳🥳🥳👌
Halloween 2018 and this one was garbage the 70s and 80s version was better
Halloween Kills Itself. Seriously, awful movie. Dialogue was the worst part. Nobody talks like the people in this movie. And what about Laurie? Well, she stays hidden, and just recites boring dramatic lines about how nothing can kill Michael. The mob was useless. Tommy was useless. All the cameos from the original actors were useless. Deepfake Loomis was poorly done. "DID MICHAEL KILL AGAIN?" Isn't that his forte? Maybe I've just outgrown this repetitive stupidity.
The whole movie in 2 minutes. Brilliant!
This movie sucked bad, the writers clearly got lazy the second half of the movie.
Lmao this movie was trash
Love ya
love that :36 shot, so menacing.
I did not appreciate how they tried to give officer Hank a storyline that was never there and the kid who fell! Smh all that wasn’t needed.
This was better than everyone made it out to be idky it wasn't revered even more
I can’t wait till october 14th 2022 for Halloween Ends
Maybe this guy isnt human... I just realize the old women kill michael myer and the texas chainsaw guy.
😅😅🍿🍿🍿🍿
it will never end " myerssss"🀄️🥷🏿
Not going to lie, I enjoyed this movie more than I should have lol 😆 It was fun, sick but fun!
I didn’t expect Michael Myers killing the hole Army of people damn he is one brave serial killer
Man I just watched this movie it’s gotta be the worst and dumbest Halloween movie that they made omg It was just dumb
the movie was whatever but I still love this trailer
Canbace Nadler 💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
Wow I never knew Micheal hated firefighters.
I want to see Halloween in the 1978 version with the nostalgia THAS CLASSIC
WE NEED THE OLD VERSION HALLOWEEN WITH THE OLD MASK

Why does Micheal seem so mad?? Time to rewatch the movies.
Where is Danny McBride in this?
Well Michael and Laurie will die in this but Corey a new person being introduced will be like Jamie llyod when she touched him became evil. They hinted this road as you can't kill evil. I'm thinking Corey becomes the new Michael at the end. The shape I mean. He will take his mask out it on as the end credits come on. He's obsessed with Michael. He probably may take his mask while Michael is hurt and becomes possessed with the evil force that transcends Michael. He doesn't have the mask on he is vulnerable.  It happened in previous films. Even though this timeliness is different. Halloween 5 He cried with the mask off. He got beat by the towns people without his mask on and soon as he put it on, he became unstoppable. The ending we won't see coming but it's my guess The Shaoe will have a new younger body but this saga ends and leaves it open for someone either to continue it or just start a reboot. One things for sure this saga here is over.. Laurie and Michael will die.. perhaps Allyson will be stalked by Michael (corey) like Laurie was...
F this
So what ever happened to Laurie Strodes son, John, from H20? And the didn’t the nurse that shared an encounter with Michael  Myers back in the day when he escaped from the mental hospital, die (get her throat slashed) on H20 when she had “Jimmy” check her house when she realized it was broken into?
Nobody could have survived that fire.     *But Michael Myers can...*
For the next round it could be michael mayer vs usmc or seal
One of the best trailers ever!!
the rubbish one of Halloween series, terrible script and directing .
really good
Even though this movie was just a bad filler, i always enjoy watching this trailer, it is really well done and built up a lot of hype, sadly movie was quite disappointing
Who is watching this now after watching movie waiting for nxt Hallween year...
I never liked modern horror movies, but this is really good, believe me, better version than past ones, really good work
This movie is so goofy like really? 😂
This franchise has morphed into a feminist crusade. I'm good
Halloween Kills was the story of a man who just wanted to get back to his window. And would kill anyone to get back to that damn window.
He is such a bad ass
ww bom dia
One of the most incompetent movies ever!
the director in this movie is making the whole character a moron, and it's very annoying to watch.
One of the most 'CHUTIYA' movie I've seen in my life.
All the victims were moron as hell. All they did were just standing at one place, screaming and waiting to be killed. They didn't know how to run also. It's very irritating to watch and this movie is probably one of the worst movies I have ever watched.
Laurie was 17 years old in Dead By Daylight depiction lol.
I love it sound efects. Angry .fear. Cry. All high screaming...
many peoples hate it but i really loved this movie enjoyed every moment.. especially The Killing are Probably The best part of this movie just the story is inlogical Hope Halloween ends Become better
I loved horror movies growing up, Hell Raiser, Friday The 13th, Halloween, ext This movie was a joke, what made it a joke was Tommy. The whole “evil dies tonight” got old pretty quick. I mean thanks to Dumbass…. I mean Tommy, the body count was pretty good 😏
The trailer spoiled way too much of this movie
Evil didn't die that night but the people trying to kill it did
I love to watch slasher movies 😁
This a f*ing joke. Can't shoot a guy who is walking away?
Stupid movie i have ever watch.... They dont kill him, destroy him into dust when they got him ...
I'm glad so many commenters enjoyed this movie. But I could not enjoy it fully. I think the acting was horrible.
I love post credit scene where Micheal says it's halloween time
I COULDNT WATCHED THIS HORSESHIT
In hindsight, it's insane how much they spoiled this movie in the trailer. There are literally two things (the flashback, and the ending) that arent shown. Even the order of the trailer follows the order of the actual film. Glad they've learned for Ends (either that or the film's shit and/or they're still deciding what it's gonna look like)
It's been a year already?! Shit time goes by fast
For 40 years police and community couldn't kill the Halloween killer but some random teenager girl some how overcame the whole town and tracked the killer to his house and miraculously managed to escape the imminent death that no one ever escaped.?!!   Please work harder on your script and setting the right roles.   Enough of this bullshit teenagers drama.
So why do people hate this movie? I just saw the extended cut and it's a pretty suspenseful, thrilling and entertaining movie. I don't understand the hate. Can someone explain it to me.
The only Halloween that I ever see is when I look in the mirror.
I remember Halloween burned bodies hanging from poles
Is it just me or this trailer is so intense in the scenes it chooses? I love this trailer but for some reason it just makes me laugh a lot.  LET IT BURN! EVIL DIES... TONIGHT! (Reveals a giant butcher knife hidden her purse) THAT'S A STRAIGHT LINE TO MICHAEL'S CHILDHOOD HOME. WE FIGHT! THE MORE HE KILLS, THE MORE HE TRANSCENDS. HE IS THE ENSENCE OF EVIL. DO IIIIIIIIIT!
2:23
Love this movie
More of the night he returns home.
Why do people even waste time killing him? Laurie has been killing Micheal 40 years now, how many times can " Evil Die "?.. The whole thing is idiotic.
The only thing about about this one was the killing besides that it was dog shii💀
Who else is coming back to this after seeing the Halloween ends trailer
Karen annoyed the crap out of me. And still feel it was a missed opportunity to cast Danielle Harris as the daughter or as a new character.
Here waiting for the ends trailer
Finally! Halloween makes it to the next level! Some people may be disappointed that this movie doesn't follow the same old formula of all the other entries, but I say that's what makes this one so awesome!
evil die to night, yeah right...people die is a classic death always the same bullshit death stupid and stupid death, stay in groupe , nope single go alone and end up dead, the end of the movie was shit as fuck why in the end they didn't just shoot and empty the gun in the head.....or cut it.
Pretty sure the myers house burnt down in one of the films so the end is inaccurate, also Laurie died about 3x lol
Lost time ,, no meaning this movies, no stories
JAIL BREAK WITH VIOLET & PEACHES IN MY SHORT SHORTS. CRIMSON AND CLOVER OVER AND OVER 4 TRUDY'S MOM.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaZn7yeldYs
This franchise died long time ago.. Now its only for this generation to know about the movie..just like rocky movies
Wow, they gave away the whole movie with that trailer. Michael isnt treated like the Boogeyman anymore, he is shown more than anyone else. Ridiculous. Glad I avoided this until after I saw the movie.
Who else watching this before the trailer for Halloween Ends?!?
Regardless of what the critics have to say about halloween kills this is a good movie and yeah its fun if you like your slasher movies and lots of blood and gore its a must see what do the critics know any way watch and enjoy
this movie is completely stupid, regret why I watched it💩
I’m so glad I did not watch the trailer when it came out. It ruins 99% of the movie. Good grief. I went into the movie knowing nothing. It was so enjoyable that way
Oh yeah
For the people who check trailers before watching……. The movie is watchable but could have been executed a little better. A lot of what makes a good horror/thriller movie has to do with the decision making of the victims. In this movie, it seems like a LOT of common sense is lacking. It really hurts this movie. I understand that fighting, running and freezing are real things that someone in the midst of danger will decide on but it legit felt like a lot of people wanted to be killed lol. If you have been a fan of Michael Myers for a while now, definitely watch it, he is one of the legends obviously. In my opinion, it turned way too much into an action film vs. classic Michael Myers. But we are horror fans and respect our OGs, so the film gets a pass 👍🏽
Wait until he grab you on his shoulder Laurie, then you can use your Decisive Strike perks (shit here we go again on DBD talks, haha)
Firefighters tried and died
A Z A Z E L
1:44 makes evil dies tonight sound cool. If only we knee
Finally, some good ending
The Shape of Hell...
I'm already have a crush on Michael
Plans for the third one
I sincerely think y’all hate on this movie just a “little” too much! I mean, it’s not as good as 2018, but it’s not like those fucking other sequels.
It was real stupid.Disgrace to Halloween movies.Worst ever.Retard emotional scene dragged on forver.Two gays with knives fight mike.lol give me a break.Stupid movie.I can see how idiots with no perspective were entertained though.
Dommage que c'est en Anglais,, Juste une annonce,, Mickaël Myers on en a pour notre argent😁la soirée passe vite dans Le salon devant ce film
I love this movie
I kill mucheal
Such a stupid movie even for the horror genre... Rule #1CARDIO

I believe no one want Michael Myers died
This was so bad! Worst one I’ve seen.
nice shot!
A WOODCHIPPER would’ve ended this a LOOOOONG time ago..
Halloween was fairy decent but this was just utter garbage.
Jamie Lee couldn’t possibly know back in 1978 that she’d be playing the same character FORTY YEARS LATER
Search for him in daytime, dont split up and always go together,if u get him, behead him. Problem solved. 🤣🤣
The movie just came out and I know the end but I'm going to keep it a secret
Halloween Ends trailer month. 🎃
Podiste matar a los bomberos
Now. Over texts.  Jorge:  Hey miss Angel, I pick this, it ok?  Me (Miss Angel G): No. Jorge. You can't choose that. Bipolar  is not like Bipartisan. Bipolar is a medical condition.    Love with no sights to end and no holds to unconditional Love.
Today: H has no end. When made real by apparition hands, what is under it is yours, usually has plastic to hold it with a design to it, hand him the plastic create, your next door to play hanky with it.   Purple is 37, Sister Miss Angel Gutirrez
0:34-0:36 Was disappointed it didn't have those angles in the movie
I told you about it in the head. It is not over and I have woman issues you don't want to experience with me . I will write in inks in texts through device. I do care. I was talking about you Brother. Miss Angel Gutirrez. Love with no holds.
One the most  crappiest  movie of 2021. Rather than scared I was just giggling how stupid the director or the script writer was. A load full of bulls.... I can write a better story in an hour.
Should be expecting the Ends trailer pretty soon....
This is Halloween this I have already seen.
1:02 what’s that sound
TV
is MM immortal?
Michael myers legendary
I was rooting for Michael the entire time! The characters in this movie are so annoying, they all deserved to die!
This is absolutely dogs 💩, don't waste your time, each one gets more ridiculous, and it's pointless Jamie lee Curtis being in it, as her role is not worth talking about. I watched it free, just glad I didn't pay to see it.
Deals or no deals are not my deal kinds as well but I send you messages that are well said and kind to your head but inside you laids a different person kind enough to say ok I'll do it but you don't and I am not the one to please either and I am not here to say be here and join me to anything but be yourself which you isn't when I see the text you you see to your heart nearby is not your say to me but I am here. I have business to do with him who deals me everything I do so I better go now. no sisters in this one. bye.
Wow the trailer actually looks great. Hope it's as good it looks
Was a good one. Cant wait for the 3rd one
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎 Worst movie   The dirtiest movie I've ever seen 🤢

whose the head banger now? here is what I did during it brother to tell other than Julie Newmar but you can tell Jamie Lee Curtis my woman says it really fast and died in it. ha. writes me which me Angel of purple kind:  That moment when your friends create a lie to say they ain't me in the head for seeing with ears and convincing themselves they are doing the whole fixing their ears not to see and get lost in the moment and tell me what are you doing waiting for the fixing we started and we said some words without her and him from the house who says it and found out we can do ourselves then I smile and say "really? I was convince you were lying to me in the head and you said how's twos is mine to stay the night in the Navajo languages and I left you two sitting at the bar and your convinced I am here to stay when your home already and text me "where are you? " and left your bags in my rooms. What should I do with them? Are you convinced I left you there and you had to catch a ride with my sister's cousin and not realize I was never there too I sat at home listening to music and you kept seeing me to remind you that I was your person to choose to stand behind to holds you." I don't believe this two bitches convinces themselves they are me then says their the P of the woman kind and yup we do exist too. Bye  girls. No hairs are real in both sexes.   don't is  not included ok. say Amen you whore kind. Loves. Me. Twos.
i was using a mic row phones to my head and who I see is you and there was na tays to my heart's to stares to be meselfs of the good kind to allow it in my heart and guess I see a star in my eyes to start with and finish the stare game with him who sit outside to say his and end it with a amen to work it brother the supervisor Julie newmar is Jamie Lee Curtis to me always. start. pushing it up. love angel Gutierrez of the purple kind  byes by laws for now's to misbehave it no mishandles  haha hehe no natives but me in disguises sir.
the most ridiculous thing about this movie is that AMH thought he could take out myers with a bat!  LOL
You would have thought that being killed in practically every movie, he would at least have a limp, or a missing arm or something. The guys been set on fire so many times.  Yet he walks around with a perfectly un-melted mask that he's worn since the 1970's. He's the ultimate bargain bin Terminator.
I wish they used the actor from the old one shit would've been fire if he was as tall as the old Michael
which killers are the scariest? A the ones who run at you B the ones who walk really slowly C the ones that move only when you're not looking at them
dumb movie dumb haddonfield citizens
I use my brains to add onto system. My job as a Preistess the only one in the world in purple. Halloween is Halloween past mother's day, told mom and dad happy Halloween to Easters of hugs to get little brother going in her tummy.   haha.. I am EEE. Sole dare ha heir. I use my brains.   miss angel Gutierrez
Halloween brother make. Now you have to pay to re make movie to add ONS cus I use my skills and silvers are for individual to use for whatever for themselves  . Are you going to listen? sister is intelligent  here.  love, miss angel Gutierrez  I will still do it. I send what I posted to every one in USA.    I do my tele vo screens differently. I was doing it to be your sister nothing else. family.
Halloween is Halloween.   Tell your Priest.  Block spirits lines in different colors for everybody as far out it can reach that connects persons to hold onto things with what silver they have to dots to tell them things using their own made up words. Block them out.   I don't why they did not use their silver or dots to block bad to stop bad using their own silver to stop bad things to make good out of it.  They have no brains. Bunch of idiots.  love, Angel Gutirrez #purple
Laurie is survivor
I enjoyed it, this movie was just Michael killing a bunch of people and having fun doing it.
Halloween has to stop in time with you. Julie Newmar needs a underwear. You need to stày away. tth. start making it for him to claim using sand particles the one who look at you to say you're ok to him. Hàlloween is still come back after it's finished. I will be here to sày it with during. start setting up. handsy only with wives  throw yours in with Julie newmar. go .
Hallowen o my gad 🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🇹🇷🇹🇷
Yes Halloween
Then you should block me out to make it easy. Native American Indians are the original Partisan without the Bi- to the word. See if we meet and tell each other who is the best at this. And there is no list. No holdings but the earth.   Love, Miss Angel Gutirrez
Stupidest movie ever it was so dumb.
Give or take it was not me who started the gang war is what you are saying.
14 movies and the characters does not hear about the word decapitation. Well unless Michael is Deadpool in disguise.
I WATCHED THIS MOVIE IT WAS AWSOME
This movie started off very well and then it turned into a big mess... disappointing
OMG Love it, Love it! cannot get enough of Michael Meyers and Jamie Lee Curtis! they are a legend, please bring more! am a Halloween fan!
😋
I wished they continued nightmare on elm street and friday the 13th too...
this movie was tbe best thing ive ever seen since the 2018 version and the ending was so edging OMGGGG 10000000/10
the hottest movie I've ever seen in my life halloween kills the movie is a disaster do not waste time on anything
HALLOWEEN KILLS (2021)           Starring  :  *Judy Greer*                             *Anthony Michael Hall*                             *Andi Matichak*                             *Will Patton*                             *Kyle Richards*                             *Charles Cyphers*                             *Omar Dorsey*                             *Thomas Mann*                             *James Jude Courtney*                             *Jamie Lee Curtis*
I guess it's good enough .
0:35 and 0:37 how come they never showed those 2 shots in the movie
lovely songs !
Hướng dẫn đàn bài bethoven virus  đi ạ
Danny McBride stated that their are 3 Halloween films. I personally think Jason Blum forced him to make 3 and he had ideas for 2 films. Because this film felt like one big teaser for Halloween Ends. This is all speculation, obviously.
Dan of mychael myers🚮🪓🔨
Yeah mychael mayers I  am a big dan of him 😁
💝💝💝
I wish they would let this man rest in peace
This was a Stupid movie !!! He never dies ! They’re making millions of dumb ass people that go watch this movies
One of the worst films I've ever seen. The franchise should have stopped at H20 because everything after is just a parody of itself and it's embarrassing to think it went from one of the biggest horror icons to this garbage. |:
Warning: Film contains halogen bulb death scene lol And Michael running full speed in 1978! And a CGI Loomis with a terrible voice over!
Horrible LMFAO! Did Zombie write this dialog? Fuck is muttered 45 times in 10 minutes!
Evil dies tonight, you thought wrong
I love this movie
2:20 you want your mask? COME AND GET IT
I like watching this movie put it on 💯,I'm Robert Marfeo Jr...
Фильм бомба
Fucking love Judy Greer 🖤🖤🖤💚
This movie ticked me off... Now, hear me out.. if Michael is cursed, there is a way to fricking kill him ! Everything has to have a balance in nature so there's either a counter curse, a weapon, a spell... SOMETHING that these idiot people are not looking for...
This was by far the least scariest horror movie that I’ve seen in a long time, it was worse than Pet Sematary and I didn’t think anything could be worse than that
Awesome thanks ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Boring ass horror movie! Why everyone in it acting dumb?!
Jamie Lee Curtis has been facing Michael since 1978. It's cool to see her still playing the part. No one else could play Laurie.
Cheers to Michael!!!! He mastered the art of teleportation, he just walks never runs and still comes up right behind you even though you are running😂😂
The more he kills the more he gets Exp, he's probably lvl 121 now or more.
bruh come on just watched it Michael should of died already yall doing too much even the leatherface movie too litteraly copied yall and did the same thing and he didn't die which makes both movies litteraly rotten tomatoes 5/10 or lower bc yall made some things like ridiculous where these people had him and could of killed him and shot him in head but no humans are not this stupid. other then that that's why scream Movie the new  one even tho they made a new one they did good and made everything sense even tho scream is a different killer everytime but it makes it more realistic in a type way in a away what makes more people satisfied by it and did good and still made everything make sense. tbh I think jason suits more of role to being immortal micheal should died in this movie and even leatherface in there newest movie but I get it yall with the money but nothing I can do but just to say yall could of made more money if yall did that on this movie think about it.
Wtf
So no one thought of bringing a saw and removing his head and extremities off of his body, to see if he still gets to live after that????
I love this franchise so much! 😭
What a POS of a movie.
Everyone that died deserved it just based on how stupid they were
does cameron elam character meets the terms of new 2020s academy gender equality regulations? rough vulgar gore picture, no wonder of $130.000.000 gross worldwide... pathetic income record. you do not discuss the tastes. however, in this particular case, the intellectual level of the audience, evidently below all criticism....
First my favorite game Battlefield was ruined now you shit on Holloween Kills great job Writers.
It s good but fo the next movie they should make something more,the problem is that he s from a small town. Now I have sensitive spirit,this help me give ideas.
This movie is so chee cheezy, terrible. don't have real human situations, people shooting themselves. 1 movie is the best, 2 good.
It amazes me trailers like these give so much away, might as well have not bothered watching the movie its all here
Seriously my mother name is Judith Myers , Myers being her maiden name.   Wen she saw the first movie  She walked out of the theater after seeing her damn name on a tombstone .  Sense then never watched another horror movie again
worst film I have ever watched, and I have watched Gigli.
I get the idea you have to not do the extreme cause you wouldn't have another movie. But why the hell would you not decapitate him. The movie literally just has a scene where he is shot stabbed etc and they just call it a day. Any town that was terrorized by a serial killer that had the mob mentality knowing he just wouldn't die would mutilate his body. limb from limb etc.
Why is there a transvestite in this film.  Why put "one of those" in a halloween film for fck sake?
I don't normally like the Halloween movies, but this one was 🔥 🔥 🔥
None of them compare to the originals, this one was corny and lame just like the other ones, the only good remake in my opinion is the rob zombie one!!! dialogue was stupid the actors can't act!!! What a shame!!
Worst Halloween movie ever!!!
Halloween got the vaccine of female birth control in the form of COVID-19 since first dose including booster shots. I am 100% percent sure. I got told in Mindfreaks.Halloween must go on. Talk to hospital liaision does know. Ring a lawyer for medical malpractice compensation.  Take care  Brother    Mama Mia.  Love, Angel (en ingles) L. Gutirrez (not spanish) . (I am a girl too)
I haven’t laughed this hard in a long time😂🤦🏾‍♂️
I'm still waiting for Halloween in space 🤣
When did Michael become supernatural???  Isn't he just a regular guy??  All of a sudden he's Freddy 😡 Side note=that stupid nurse doctor couple were utterly USELESS 😤
Oh God.
0:34 Michael didn't turn the Hallegan in the movie
this movie was straight comical at times
Um scary
Halloween 🎃 Kills 🔪 (2021) is Rated R in red. ❤️
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO yALL whAT IF tHIs hAPpeNEd In rEAl liFe
My goodness, They know how to keep the Michael Myers character interesting; I still want to watch these Films,;  I normally don't like cheap Horror Films, with the Sex and the violence;  I  prefer Stephen King Films; A writer who doesn't need to resort to such Base Elements to keep You on the edge of Your seat; but for some reason, I keep being drawn into this Character;  even though , I know it's going to end the same way ..with a Cliff Hanger; Just the Ground Work for yet another Sequel!
So, did they bring back the supernatural edge to Meyers? Somehow, I think Blumhouse is going to screw it up for the hundredth time.
I've literally seen the movie already 3 TIMES! BUT STILL really good🎹🏡🌍
I hate how they reveal so much in the trailer, like i want to see Michael Myer's kill a fire department in the movie not the trailer.
How to escape Micheal ?  Ans : Run
Theory: Micheal Myers is probably the Apprentice of William Afton since the amount of times he always comes back.
The bloodiest slasher I´ve ever seen in theaters
So did the evil died that night... Or we gon have to wait for the next halloween
Dudes!!! Halloween ends is coming
The '  let it burn ' makes me shiver every time
I didnt even want to watch this movie because of the bad reviews but damn it was great in my opinion.
Crowd: Evil must die! Evil must die! Fans: Evil can't die! Evil can't die!  The Extended Cut is pure dope.
I love ke this movie lol...
Dear Rob Zombie, your 2007 film Halloween is an unrivaled masterpiece to this day. As a big Michael Myers fan like many others, I would like to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for your hard work and I would like to thank each and every one of your team who worked on the film. Jason Blum and David Gordon Green have come nowhere near achieving what you have created.
Not even Indominus Rex in Jurrasic World can kill Michael Meyers. Indomimus: Damn it! I ate Michael Meyers last week and pooped him out but now he's back!
last day on earth
The ending pissed me the **** off. At this point, I’m rooting for Michael because they literally had him and ****** it up. 😭😤😂😂😂
Great movie. Definitely a 10/10.
We need that cello Halloween theme for Apple Music, Spotify, etc……
Just how many films will it take to get rid of Michael Myers?
Looks like they used Stellan Skarsgård as a model for the mask
Quick message. Halloween. You are correct. And sue your HOP. I know you have birth control running in your nervous system and veins. You had shots of birth control not covid 19 in your vaccination. Using brothers phone. Take care. Halloween rules. Momma Mia. Love, Angel Joe Gutirrez.  #purple
lumayan ga bikin kecewa
biasa aja dah bosen
ceritanya gitu gitu aja
I wanted to like this movie so bad!! I was so hyped for it after seeing 2018 but honestly in my opinion this movie was a major let down!!! Literally almost unwatchable at times!! The only good part to me was the flashback scene. The punchlines and the dialog is just so bad and unbelievable. Lol no in real life actually talks like that when Laurie is describing what motivates Micheal to kill or whatever. EVIL DIES TONIGHT isn't a bad punchline but the way they overused it was nauseating! I really hope halloween ends is better!!!
EVIL Dies Tonight
Borrrring
It is just more of the same when sequel after sequel after sequel like this comes out.  It is like anything else the first experience is a shocking introduction to a new killer but you get so used to it after awhile that it loses its appeal same thing with Friday the 13th which for me has LONG since gotten boring, repetitive and totally predictable WHAT do you expect to see with yet ANOTHER sequel in a long drawn out line of sequels like this the villain is an unstoppable killer the whole movie through...YAWN it is just NOT that exciting anymore sitting down to watch this you KNOW what is coming the SAME damn thing that happened in the previous installment and the one before that AND the one before that at first it was like "WHAT is up with this guy?" But now it is merely like watching Micheal or Jason just to through the motions of killing until movie ends not phased by anything they are seemingly impervious to ANY sort of attack blah blah blah blah.  You shoot, hit, run over,or burn Micheal or Jason and they just magically keep surviving Micheal  has already been burned to a crisp once in a previous installment of this series in fact he was blown up by a gas explosion but yet HERE HE HIS still alive it becomes like watching a mass production of a product on an assembly line or something Micheal or Jason are the mass producing machine mass producing dead bodies out comes one dead body than another than another and on and on and on blah blah blah blah blah I am desensitized to sequels like this because it is all fake anyway it's all special effects no ones really dieing in the movies...meh WHATEVER on to the NEXT sequel of Micheal and Jason onto MORE of the same.😒
IKR every guy with a gun in this movie fires 10 feet away from the target. Happy butchering Michael ✌️
Omg micheal is alive??? Anyways
Just use your speed against him
My boyfriend and me went to the cinema to see the new Halloween movie in the cinema
Who remembered Texas chainsaw..😂
Drugs not Hugs.  Just sayin. 🍺
Omg!   They incorporated the 3 masks from Season of the Witch!!   Love it!   Love that freakin movie!
Stupid movie, stupid characters
Leatherface:Hey You Copied Me With My Saw🤬🤬🤬 Michael Myers:No I Wasn't Do That😳
Stop
Everyone: *EVIL DIES TONIGHT* Michael Myers: *UNO REVERSE*
Michael and Leatherface need to team up 🤣
Love  halloween  for  death 💀
This movie wasn’t good at all the trailer is actually better
Ok… how did i miss this movie???
I still can't believe this and the first one were written by the goofy guy from the old Apatow movies and low budget movies like the foot fist way.  Incredible
I wish someone would just cut the mask up.  He always ends up getting it back, putting it on, and then killing people. I know it wouldn't stop him from killing but I bet it would sure bring him down a bit mentally
Who else in the side of Michael Myers? Give a Like👍 me 100% in side of MM👍👍👍👍
Moral of the story- hating evil is way worse than evil itself.
*DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME*  It's truly a frustrating movie. *EVERY* character has a good shot of killing Michael but they *ALL* slip up and fail. Even when the *WHOLE TOWN* gangs up on him they *ALL* get killed. *TRASH MOVIE*
terrible storyline as a 10 year old could have written a better story,it says starring jamie lee curtis but should have read cameo role by jamie lee curtis as was on screen less than three minutes and was in a bed for the first 70 minutes then again she was co producer so why not get the title role with only 3 minutes or less on screen,they blew a good opportunity to make a good film yet blew it big time
Another franchise which will never end no matter how ridiculous they may become, purely because the producers can't come up with any thing else original
Just watched and loved it......especially the ending. I just knew when they were giving Michael M a beat down on the street he's go all John Wick on their asses, lol!
My theory is Michael is the good guy. He was given a vision  as a child that his sisters line would give birth to the antichrist. He was given supernatural powers to stop it happening. This explains why he survives as long as the line continues and why he hunts down his family
Man, how the people in this city can be so stupid, they asked to be dead. It's silly, stupid and shit movie. I had to effort myself to watch until the end.
Think how Laurie changed in 1978 she had no idea what was happening and in 2021 she got the whole town to hunt him down
Then kill chuckie ass and stop making remakes. They killed cany man like a hundred times come up with another villain already dang. These villain been here since the 90's still not dying.
So chopping his head off or shooting him in the head is not everyones first means of attack. Even the devil cant survive a shot gun to the head. If u can kill jason and freddy you can kill his ass. Im tired of these reboots. Damit kill him off already
People from that town: *"Sh't! or we really really suck, or this guy is really that good"*
He s still alive
I mean seriously, what were they thinking when they made this crap? For real though, when they were done filming and sat back and watched this, how could they possibly think they did Halloween justice? It’s really such a waste of energy . Such a disappointment
Hear me out .. Lori was on so many drugs after surgery she was dreaming this whole time so Halloween kills never happened.   Michael has been in and around the hospital stalking lorie until she wakes up to be slightly fair and then Halloween ends starts after Halloween 2018.   Halloween kills was a dream sequence..
LET IT BURN!!!!
This was an interesting movie but not a Halloween movie. You can tell John Carpenter wasn't involved.
This movie didn't end right
he just kills the firemen that just saved his life, talk about a lack of gratitude
i love this movie it make me scared🤩🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🥵🥵🥵🥶🥶😎😎😎😱😱😱😱😈😈😈
Theory   Micheal cant die because only Laurie can   Think about it  Micheals main goal is to get back to his house but the only thing standing in his way was Laurie  maybe Laurie is the only person who could kill Micheal but having to kill herself in the process    Micheals main victim was Laurie for unknown reasons and so maybe micheal has to end Laurie before she can end him
This movie was straight up stupid.
I'm calling it. The mom dies, and the granddaughter takes over
If  Jason  Voorhees from  Friday the 13th and  Michael Myers join alliances the whole world will be chaos
1 of the funniest movies of the year. It's like everyone was shooting with their eyes closed. Most of the characters were playing dumb. Just hilarious! 🤣
I watch 2018 halloween and i not watch 2021 halloween but now i watch because this film series is amazing
I hope they explain how he never dies like when he was incarcerated they gave him some meds to calm him down but instead basically gave him a super soldier serum because I don’t want to hear them say he is a supernatural being 😑 so stupid.
The next Halloween movie shall be called hallloween wars. It shall be about all the horror characters having a war including Michael.
I haven't watched any of the halloween movies but i like to know why the fuck a six years old would kill his 17 years old sister?! And how?!
THE CONCEPT OF THE WHOLE TOWN HUNTING MICHAEL IS SHITPICKING FUCKERY!!!!!! PEOPLE GET REAL....THE FILM MAKING INDUSTRY HAS GONE TO THE DESPERATE DOGS.... WHAT MORE CAN THEY DO TO MAKE A BUCK???? AND ALL THE WASHED UP OLD FOGGIES ACTORS WITH THEIR ASSES DRAGGING.... FOR SHAME!!!! THE WRITERS HAS KAKA FOR BRAINS...AS STEPHEN KING WOULD SAY.🤣🤣🤣😂 OH HOLY SHIT...WHAT HAS THE FILM INDUSTRY COME TO LORDY LORD.... THIS IS BY FSR THE ABSOLUTE WORSE ' HALLOWEEN SHIT FILM EVER!!!......IT'S GOT TO BE A COMEDY HORROR....RIGHT??? WHAT A FU##ING WASTE OF LOW BUDGET DESPERATE HEAP OF KAKA.    SAD SOO SAD..
I just bought the extended cut of Halloween Kills yesterday at Best Buy
*The song at* 2:19 *is there a longer version of it!?*
JESUS IS KING 🤴 GOD LOVES US ALL GOD IS GREAT 👍🏾 ACCEPT JESUS AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR
Wtf did I watch? This part was so stupid.
I just finished the movie and I couldn’t be more disappointed!!;( The only decent scene was the one when he killed all the Fireman’s!! How could  they actually take this long to make this movie ? and it was so fucking terrible!! 😢
I wouldn’t even waste you’re time people it’s a joke of a movies literally cringe worthy and predictable
so stupid why burn the whole house? if they wanna be certain that he's dead, why don't shoot him in the head point blank when he stare at them just before the house burned. But again, I get it, horror movie characters tend to make stupid decisions. In case the movie really sell it, so they don't wanna michael really dead for possible sequels.
Tried to watch this piece of crap, I knew that this was not a feel good movie, but this senseless killing is so .....old.....nobody wants to see that, Avoid at any cost.
Horror trailer: https://youtu.be/9iuyh4yIcns
This movie sucked so fucking bad what a shame
Hi
If your reading this remember all things are possible with God he’s gonna give you more than you ask for just trust in him amen 🙏🏿💙🙌.
The different Halloween  Movies are totally  awesome. Don't miss them, "you'll regret ìt" They got to make sure they keep making them, But don't get cheezie!!!
I just can't watch it. I watched the 1st one and I just couldn't get into it. I've loved Halloween since the 1st one. How can I just forget 20 yrs of the story that Michael is Laurie's brother. It's just not for me. I'll enjoy watching the old ones
So the movie will be good
Would not recommend this to anyone
What a shame this movie was 🗑 because the trailer did look good
i Wish That i Was Michael Myers in Real Life 🎃
Michael been trying to kill his sister since the 70s thats a very strong dedication lol
she tried to kill him in 78 with a fire and she tried it again now my fellow queen.How did you not know it wouldn't work you litteraly did that when you were 17 years old use ur brain
This is more of a comedy than a horror film.  You really have to leave common sense behind to enjoy this film.
The transition from Michael stabbing someone to the women stabbing herself was clean!!
this movie was dogshit
Literally the most boring flim
Nih brapa rating nya bro? Bgus ngak film nya
Why is there a musical number in a Halloween movie?
I watched the movie and its soo good i love it ❤️
An excellent horror movie to experience..Jamie Lee was spectacular as was the unstoppable Michael, slashing his way to immortality...See ya all at the next one ...
Shit movie, don't waste your time. Also Michael must be around 70-75 years old at least by now. Yet, he can still catch his victims by walking whist they run for their life. 😆 🤣
So I just watched this... Loved the nostalgia of it, but sooooooooo cheesy. The “evil dies tonight” line was so terrible it was distracting. Obviously Danny McBride wants this franchise for his own. Please put some more effort into the next one. And for fuck sake, USE THE ORIGINAL “SHATNER” MASK!!!
You can not kill Michael you can only prison him.
Finally watching it. I've watched the very first one at the Movie theater when I was 8 years old. To me the first one will always be the best one.  But this one is really creepy. I loved that they Edited Dr. Loomis in the picture. He was a part of that movie from the start. 5 Stars in my book.
Leatherface MK10
More like a comedy than a horror movie. Absolute dog shit
This was really bad.
Pretty good movie Michael Myers smokes a lot of people on here.
Really enjoyed that one ! He is more bad ass then ever !
Don’t waste your time movie is trash
This movie is stupid.  Like literally nothing can kill this guy like wtf! They need to stop making this shit
Really good! First part was awesome too! 👌
This movie was pretty good it was kind of bland though if you ask me I wasn't on my edge it didn't freak me out one bit it's not the original the original still freaks me out but Michael Myers is my favorite killer for sure
trailer its spoiler
The end , Another open door for the next one...cliché
Fun Fact: Michael is Obama's 2cd cousin and Pelosi's first husband.
I love micheal myers movies😆but Their FIRE
This film was very good I liked it & would watch it again & again
God this movie was garbage 🗑
WTF last i seen Michael Myers got his head cut off why  the F is he still alive?
This movie is pure ass and comedy.. 15 people with a gun and everyone shoots and missed🤣🤣🤣🤣
This was the worst film I've seen in 2021
I think the first 3 Halloween movies thrilled me.  Watching this and I don't care how many people Michael kills, just did not give me the thrills like I used to get.  Cracks me up on how this one girl is running for her life and Michael merely walks towards her and still catches up.
I grew up with this man 22 years now watching Halloween in still watch it I can’t wait for Halloween kills
But I’m excited for next years Halloween
When I watched the movie for some reason I was excited for the beginning for Michael to kill  the fire fighters but he kills them but I felt bad for them
A trained cop shoots multiple times at someone without finding him at all with 3 meters distance WTF kind of a joke is that? I left at the first 10 minutes!
Please I'd love to hear fans tell their ideas of a Halloween 2018 sequel, if they were writing and/or directing Halloween Kills. I'm so legit curious about what Halloween Kills might have been.
This is my favourite slasher film, the clue is in the name of the film it's about killing, which we get a lot of.
Man… this movie had so much potential. It’s literally like they decided to say “Eh screw it, make these well known characters, new and old, completely stupid for plot reasons”. Michael Myers is my favorite horror villain, and I’m glad they didn’t ruin him in this movie. But holy shit, there are so many moments in this movie where it felt like he was a shark being fed chum. And at the end of the film, there were so many opportunities for him to be killed. I know there’s going to be a third one and that’s why, but if they didn’t announce that there was going to be a third one, then I wouldn’t have felt that way. I don’t know just felt like it was a wasted movie, with wasted characters, a wasted plot, and wasted dialogue about things we already know. Also, the mob mentality crap was handled horribly
Somebody in there😁
Wack overrated movie
this movie was horrible in every element possible
Feel like they just showed us the whole movie right here
This movie ight but it was weak to me the first one was better
Should be titled,  "Micheal learns to drive"!! Lol
Micheal can to the "Thriller: and still catch up to your ass!! 🤣😒
Way too complex. For a simple premise.
Most anticipated movie this year ❤️
This movie was a steaming hot pile of laughable shit. Fuck you, Hollywood.
Une tuerie
DBD
MICHAEL FOREVER!!!!!! HALLOWEEN FOREVER!!!!! JAMIE LEE CURTIS FOREVER!!!!!!👌👌👍👍👍👍👍✌✌✌✌✌✌
I think, like much of the recycled and retread films of the current era (Star Wars 7+, Star Trek, Mission Impossible 17, etc) it might be time to let Michael Myers and the Halloween franchise die (pun intended). There are new stories and characters and narratives out there waiting to be discovered. Come on writers and producers, we know you can do it!
This was incredible to see in imax at the theatre, if you didn’t go and watched on peacock you missed out
I like the light bulb into the neck thats a good one.
The fucker was burnt to toast in part 2 the rocks up in part 4, 5 6 7 8 9 10 , then in the Newest Holloween in the nut house when the 2 idiots that are reporting on him shows him the mask he looks like a normal aging man.
I dont want to buy it, i just want to rent it.
Whoever wrote this shit needs to go back to writing school because it's just simply stupid from start to finish.
The movie was amazing, can’t wait for  “Halloween ends”  in 2022
Jason vs Myers would be the real fun
mikael mayers
I normally don't leave comments on movie trailers, but this one, ... This movie was TRASH and in all honesty, everybody deserved to die just for being f stupid. You tell me that out of 20 people, not ONE decided to shot him in the fucking head?! And you have a whole entire town on his ass, and he still manages to survive? At this point, f everybody.
The best one since the 1st and the second...
I remember someone posting a comment saying they stopped the movie halfway through because there was too much killing, like you do know it’s called Halloween KILLS right? What were you expecting?
There should be a game where u become michael myer. Who didnt want to play game where u gotta kill people during halloween night and looking cool at the same time.
He got cursed
It's like the mask makes him stronger and makes them invincible so he can't die I don't know how that mask does that
Please make the real movie not trailers I don't like the trailer Halloween kills is a great why did you use real fighter fighters
I love this version of Michael's theme, it's so epic
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE michael myers vs chuck norris
Next time the whole city is killed by Michael and he moves on to the next town. Maby New York.
I didn’t watch it yrt
Que, caracter Que huevos,😈😡 Estos personajes👍
The worst halloween of Them all.
I just watched the movie it was amazing
Oooo
So disappointed in this movie I’m a huge Halloween fan It was such a boring movie the trailer was literally the only good parts very disappointed I get it they wanted to make  another movie but this movie was literally a waste of time
what is soundtrack name?
Worst movie ever ...this sequel sucks ass waste of time
honestly with the first 11 min of the movie, the acting was godly awfull
This movie was truly a masterpiece.  Even though i hv already watched it, i came here again to see the trailer because it such a well made film.  Now what i like to see in the sequel - story behind Michael's evilness ; the curse of Samhain on the Myers family.
The most brutal film in the franchise.
this movie was so bad
Oh no
main character won't be killed by NPC's 😂
Just watched this n I guess Michael will outlive us all... big Jon n lil jon totally unnecessary but @the same time worth it!  ....all I could hear after seeing lil jon is Stewart from SNL "I don't wanna say.." Lmao..the way he was scared of his own reflection 😂😂😂these movies get more pointless and less scary. Smbdy should have cut his head off by now. Just sayin
What a load of shit this was
Which OTT has released... Halloween kills......???
I love how this movie had gays, people of all color and creeds and they all got killed w equal abandon. Michael is an equal opportunity slayer
Areally bad movie. Amateur plot writing producting and terrible acting.This film is shit. The director and the producer should both be ashamed of themselves.

Hunting down Michael Myers?? Michael Myers hunts you. You are ruining the essence of this movie.
Suck crap movie...Never dies, just like that crap Freddy Krueger BS..
https://youtube.com/shorts/nhehU0bgGDU?feature=share
Horrible
EVIL DIE TONIGHT!!
I also like how there are burn marks in the Mask it makes him look more badass, even though it's rubber and should have melted in the fire.
I like how the whole town thinks they can kill Michael Myers when he has been Shot in the head more than once, got burned, decapitated, stabbed, had a shotgun blast to the chest more than once and he still didn't die, so how do they think they can kill him with baseball bats and pitchforks and guns? There is no such thing as killing Michael Myers all you can do is give him Laurie Strode and he will just go away and just stay out of his way and your fine, I would have broken Laurie's Arms and Legs and give her to Michael Myers alive so he can have the pleasure of killing her because if you kill her he could get mad at the whole town and never go away.
This last movie was dumb! Nobody can endure the beating he got by the towns people. When does the next one come out? Maybe Rob Zombie will make a part 3 and it will be so much better
C'est sur naturellement merdique!!
JOM
Michael wears a mask.  If they just told police he was black, they'd have killed him immediately.
This was great, I enjoyed seeing Michael Myers retire all the old cast members lol 🤣..
Wonderful that there is inclusion 👏🏻
So not how the resurrection ended  He was in a morgue   n woke up. He never walked out the house alive .
This is amazing
people be like ''we are killing micheal!'' micheal be like '' going on rampage''
Dead by Daylight fans are absolutely going to watch this movie.

Chucky tv series (2021) is dead it's just there's multiple but the main one died (Charles,) probably Halloween kills (2021) Michael still alive scream 5 (2022 January) going to die like always.  all of them die or get hurt BUT MICHEAL NEVER DIES THE MORE HE KILLS THE MORE TRANSCENDS no human can survive that fire or stabs and even gunshots. that guy has no good inside him he is the essence of evil YALL that's why he never dies. that's, why he was still alive and Karen, (Laurie strode Daughter) got stabbed by Michael and might have died at the end even though Michael got shot and stabbed by the whole town and stabbed by Karen.
It would be cool if they put mr sandman in Halloween ends when the movie opens
Micheal: “I don’t always die, but when I do, I don’t.”
I think his head could cut off
If only they used guns
After watching it 5 times I just want to say that I loved it and can’t wait until Halloween ends
I felt soooo bad for the old couple. Horrible way to die while playing with a drone
this is just stupid lol, this is comedy
for the pouts
This movie is one of the stupidest movie I ever saw, the people of the town are just idiots, Michael is the hero is this movie.
A man couldn't live without his dog, the more he kills, the more he transcends...Jardani Jovanovich is beyond this evil
Ever since Halloween (2018) came out, slasher movies have really been revitalised, and ironically seem to be copying how Halloween (2018) used the same title as it's original, Candyman did it, scream is doing it and now Texas chainsaw massacre is doing it, honestly I think we owe it to Halloween (2018) for bringing the genre back and should respect that film a lot more now.
Oh shit yes
Nonsense movie, in end of the movie crowd of people with 😒 bat, knifes and gun couldn't kill Michael Myers. And everybody know if you want to kill someone for sure its the head were you hit to kill for sure. I'll give 4/10
So glad I didn't watch the trailer until after the movie came out. It would've ruined some cool moments
I don't be Michael myers
IF one of the firemen was STIPE MIOCIC, HE WAS FKED   : D
Impossible movie 😪
This movie is the bomb! By far one of my favorites of the series. Michael was not playing around. I loved it
I think he is the eternals too, he's not old anymore, if he dead so what are you gonna watch next year.
movie was so fucking painful to watch thank goodness i didnt pay to see this shit
Okay next movie michael myers vs seals time 6 😂😂😂
“LET IT BURN!” the best line ever
Why Micheal Myers not get burn?
the most unrealistic movie. guy gets shot, run over by a car, shotguned in the head, burned in the fire ...
Loved the references to Halloween 3 with the masks!
imagine hurting a senior citizen michael myers and he still cant die. Lol
No bullets, knife, bats, bombs, fire, and all other deadly weapons can stop michael from coming home. he is immortal. he is more than human. while... all other  characters in the movie are animals who cant think like a normal human being. Lol
Halloween kill is the best movie in my opinion this year. Spiral 2021 is not comparable. Need part 3 for Halloween, best movie 2021
The ending is so lame
Even if you destroy the whole planet he'll still be alive
I'm honestly not convinced that Halloween Ends is the last Halloween movie, there's just no way he will die, he just going to end up surviving!!!! He'd the essence of Evil!!!!😈😈😈😈😈
Despite the logic and my god the logic in this film but all that aside the kills, cinematics, soundtrack ect is 100% fucking awsome and always was since 2018
Just seen this on Sky now. OMG 😱 !!!! There has to be another follow up surely!?!? Absolutely awesome! Definitely better than the previous, I thought 👌👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
This is the worst movie I've seen in this year so far.
"Evil dies tonight"  Haha! That line cringes me so much after me and my family finished watching the new movie that came out early enough😂😂😂😂😭
I hate these movies nowadays.... Like it's so hard to watch these... And pretty much everyone deserve to die in this for how fking stupid they are... Like they know he's so powerful and approach him with a pocket knife... Some just hit once and take a 5 min break before next hit... And he like the slowest mg I've ever seen yet no one runs from him.. They simply look at him.. Run like a kids and give stops in between for him to catch up... Like really...
Me encanta
I dont care what everyone says.... I think this was a very well made movie with good scenes... Firefighters scenes was lit, Stairway head kill was dope, last scene where he puts his mask on surrounded by mob was great.... Michael Myers is Immortal and I wish he stays Immortal
At the end when I thot Michael is going to die....I really wished him to get up and kill everyone.... And he actually did it....I was so happy for him...😁
50 years of terror
I watch Halloween kills in the movie theater it was so creepy I kind of like it have you guys seen it
People should remember this; The cinematic effects used in Halloween became a Success for the entire slasher franchise. This was unique to the Halloween slasher series.  That concept - Someone who's personality traits is that of a psychopat, showing no remorse in his or her's actions, hiding their facial expression behind a mask; So you are not able to see what the individual is thinking, and or feeling. Add a sense of paleness mixed in with a bit of white - contrasts -  and you've got the perfect neutral facial expression that awakens the most basic fight or flight response in us when we see it.   ... Why?  Because you can't trust anyone who's facial expression is behind a mask - You don't know what they are up to. Is it good, or bad?   The storyline of their upbringing in a home with both psychological, and physical abuse due to alcohol and financial problems to shed some light on as to why they do what they do, is actually close to real life. It is based on real circumstances, it could happen, it has happened, and it will happen again.   Myers is not a God, he is not the devil either. He is man, just like me, and just like you.   That is what intrigue me,  about the Halloween series.
Jedan od najglupljih filmova ikad.žali bože vremena provedenog uz televizor.
We will defeat him tomorrow or another Halloween who will find out who will defeat him who will die NEXT.......?
Ok, I know it’s supposed to be for cinema and stuff, but where in the god dang world is the FBI and CIA or any type of government during this
I would like to see Jason Voorhees vs Michael myers fight in this movie
Hi my name is Kaitlin and me and my family watched Halloween kills my children were so scared
This movie was a load of crap..
My fav serial killer
I love u so much michael myers
Oh man, watching this at the theater was so AWESOME! 🌟 I loved the scene where Micheal walked out of the burning building and killed the firefighters. That was so friggin dope, man. And the scene with the mob! Ohhohohohohooo, that was intense and I LOVED IT! I’m planning on getting Halloween Kills as well as all the other Halloween movies on DVD this winter for my horror movie collection. Scary! 😁
They say that michael is unkillable   Running him with a car. Using big guns instead of bats and an iron. Using an axe. Chopping him up into pieces. Or using a bomb  Are they a joke to you?
I m still not getting how can a cop missing his target at starting of scene 🤩🤩🤩 when Michel was surrounded with bunch of people's thy just hit with everything y can't thy cut into pieces😍😍😍 but any way good movie
FUN FACT: you're not watching in full screen😂
Nonsense. Totally waste of Time. 🤬🤬
Yes Michael Myers
nah nah nah I'm happy he survived idk why lol but yeah he a good scary movie guy
Just like in 2018, they show wayyyy too much in the trailers, they show half of the good scenes in the trailer…
The storyline was dumb.
All real men should protest this filth.  The aboriginal males are presented as weak and effeminate. All other racial groups of males are presented as bumbling jackasses. This lame-a flick is loaded with anti-male violence. pro-feminist bullsh*t and an overdose of misandry.
Evil dies tonight
A want to watch the movie
Why did I feel so sorry/sad Michael when he was getting beat up and shot at when Karen lured him into a trap? Am i a psychopath?
Only thing i hated was the unmasked face.......i didn't want to know their's an old baldy in there.....
Jamie Lee and Busta Rhymes need to put their forces together in the final movie. They may be on to something…
I don't think he'll be captured because David Gordon Green does not want any repetition.
At 0:30 Michael Myers walking out of the house is so badass
Remaking the original film in to a 3 part Trilogy was never going to work.  Theres only so many times you can watch a guy walking around town stabbing people before it gets old and that time was half way through this movie...
Don't support hollywood. Witches kill thousands of children every 'holiday'.
Well I was not sure if it was the real movie or a parody of it 😂😂
They took it too far, i just watched the movie and it is as horrible as when that busta ryhmes dude hahaha, waste of time
So stupid movie - 2/10
Team him up with Jason Voorhees.
Will he ever die?
Cell phone was banned to make calls in this movie??? 🤔 Lol 😂
Is this worth it? Can't see the dislike
Aghhh!! Let me kill him!! im so angry!!!
Run go home now
Please, who makes these movies? My intelligence is so deeply offended i wont be able to recover years. I just cant. Wtfffffffffffffff, i cant remember when i watched so stupid movie like this. I cant. Im hurt.
I can’t express how i feel about this “movie”. I can only say im disqusted. Pure 0.
the fact the firemen took their ground and tried their best killing michael is respectful
watching this movie is like looking at myself in the mirror 🐼
😬😬😬😬😬😬yyyyyyyyy
Big pile of shit
مش حلو الفيلم انا لسه شايفه ملوش لازمه 👎👎
0:43 when I hear Chainsaw voice my brain says the fact that Texas Chainsaw Massacre is coming too
Amazing from start to end!!!!
Scary bit 🤣😭
Terrible movie, everyone in this movie is too stupid to survive.   I guess I keep hoping that something will actually change but no they're all the same nonsense. Just watch the original and stop there.
its not a good movie at all
DEMONS never die - they go to hell!  Michael Myers is NOT human. The director should never have shown his face "maskless. " Spoils the mystery of MICHAEL MYERS!!! !!!!
He didn’t die in the end.
Evil dies tonight
i tried my hardest not to kill myself when i watched the film. the characters had no common sense but i still watched it to the end. i guess everyone’s dumb when it comes to american horror films
Even I know when he is down to keep smashing his head in repeatedly. Stupid people.
Send in the us army
literally a horror movie just to watch it and I mean that in a bad way
Dr Loomis in the franchise is like AgathaChristie’s inspector Japp - very important but utterly helpless.
Micheal  could  use some  counciling  , anger management!!
Michael Myers T-1000 liguid metal
QUE PELICULA PINCHILA LOCO DA OCOTE DE LO MALANDRA QUE ES. UNA PERDIDA DE NEURONAS.
I just want Laurie's son to come back into the fight!!! Seriously where the hell is Harnett?!?!
I haven't had the chance to see this yet but it looks like they've managed to recapture just a little bit more of the original movies element of surprise in the kill scenes than the reboot of 2-3 years ago did..
He is like a cockroach he wont die
Well that was a lie.
https://youtu.be/hiFo0VTe5Ds
Evil never dies, even after 43 years......
halloween kills is just halloween 2018 2 XD
Laurie stroke: its over he can’t hurt anyone ever again Michael myers: bit#h what? Im on freaking killing spree right now
This will blow you all...
Something about them Michael's
Sturm graz
who would've known one kitchen knife and not taking you trick or treating lead to this
Can someone tell me why we haven't gotten a Jason movie yet? I mean is he really done?
Omg love it
This movie was a huge disappointment.
PLEASE END THESE MOVIES GUYS KILL THIS DUDE I AM TIRED
Without any dose of realism where the  victims try not to be saved .🎃But with some good scenes by the way .
Bugoa ani nga salida 🤦‍♀
Just watched this movie in cinema and it's quite bad and makes no sense
both the script and the acting were awful, don t recommend ,i was laughing at some stupid scenes that made no sense
Spoilers much 🙄
the "good" people in this make the same mistakes they've been making in horror movies since horror was a thing they  just leave him on the ground to heal up quickly then he kills them all what a waste of time
I just watched the movie.   Michael is never going to die.
Best Halloween yet!
I am so glad I didn't watch the trailer until now. Feel like I enjoyed it more than most
0:35 that is no longer human bro
What a God-awful movie.
I wonder what caused Michael start to kill people?
I REGRET watching this movie, it a shit one. There's a serial killers on the loose and cops dont know how to handle, everyone has no smartphones to communicate with others, and bunch of idiot and stupid people hunt the killers like it was just a normal person like its not big threat to them. Poor script and production. Next time make it like its real serial killer and people are aware, media where the fuck are you..stupid movie..
I just didn't like the ending , I wanted Micheal to be killed 😒😒 I enjoyed half of the movie but You don't want to see good people dying and En evil wins 😒😒
So f boring
That movie has no sense...mean kill him dude what you are looking at...
I liked Halloween Kills- it was funny and campy, unlike Halloween 2018.  I like the new super-supernatural Michael.  NOTHING can kill him.  He's more powerful than Jason!
I really hope Netherrealm Studio cam add Michael Myers as a DLC character in Mortal Kombat 11😈😈😈🤩🤩🤩
The films amazing best Michael Myers is James Jude Courtenay
When I watched Halloween 2018, I was thinking to myself at the end...."Do they really think that fire will kill Michael Myers?  He's already been charbroiled in the past, and lived to kill another day".  And this trailer proves it didn't kill him. I hate the way they try to make Michael a regular human. When there's no way a real human could live through all of the things he's lived through. I hated when they showed him with his mask off. Even though it never showed his face, it ruined the element of evil and mystery for me. I always wanted it to be discovered that he was possessed by the devil, or somehow had some sort of supernatural power. But seeing him at that insane asylum with no mask and bald head (and gray beard) just made him seem like a regular psychopath instead of a supernatural being like I always thought of him as being. If any of this even made sense.
the trailer was better than the movie. smh my head.
Moral of the story: Never forget to lock your door and mind your own business. Lol
what the hall
How is michael built so well even tho he doesn't eat
I was considering watching this film, but then I realised I've wasted enough time just watching the trailer.
1:08
It's a good theater movie imo. Can't wait till the next one comes out. 👍
I was routing for Michael after the first 5 characters were all morons and the stupid let's investigate that noise upstairs 😂😂
Probably the best movie in the franchise.. Ending was superb everyone was thinking that they can kill him by ganging up on him and they got what they deserved.
woke
There’s no way this movie gonna ends, Michael will always end up alive in every movie sequel and it’s kind of getting tedious as it goes
Weak characters lol
This movie was sooooo shit!!!the dumbest shit I’ve seen in a while wow
That fireman at 0:33 was kinda...
The mom dies in the end I’m very sorry if I spoiled it
So bad👎👎👎👎
I would love to see John wick vs mike, though I feel like mike would get bodied
He has 20 fucking lives
This is movie never ends. Michael Myers got mugged, beaten, shot 4x and stabbed in this movie and he fucking managed to survived and killed them. This is ridiculous now
Michael just wanted to go back to his old house and stare at the window. Why people won't let him?
If I was Samoan I’ll beat his ass
Pls clear one think actually Michael human or evil  because so many times stabbed & shooting also he how to alive  I stupid or director stupid
I guess publics expectations have dropped or in the moment of watching any old crap. I found this movie badly directed, acted, and the execution of the scenes of urgency were so bad! However it's watchable in a plain sort of mood!
As someone who loved "No Time To Die"....let's just say that movie did more than this one did...
Movie woulda been over if someone just pulled up with a shotgun and blow his brains out
Wow… this movie was absolute dog sh#t.. The acting of some of them were just awful.. And how is it that everyone has a gun, but they can’t shoot to save their lives🙄When Cameron is on the floor, he picks the gun up so slowly.. like wtf..And the grandkid with a shotgun, absolutely useless.. And her screaming on the bottom of the stairs, I wanted to switch the film off right then..that’s how much her acting annoyed me. And here’s an idea, why  wouldn’t you just chop Michael’s head off and lock it away in some chest and bury it with cement! Terrible movie. And the fact that Laurie was in hospital the whole time, stupid.
This movie is just dumb !! how te hell they couldn't kill him when they had all these opportunities ? like the end if you know someone been killing for 40 years why don't you just aim for the head ? just dumb !!
The kid thinks Michael mars the bogeyman the kids an idiot it’s not bogeyman it’s Michael Myers you’re going to be dead
https://youtu.be/OiDo0zN8zXI  Indie monster flick
What if Michael exists at John wick universe
Does anybody know when this movie will be out to rent in the UK?
Am I the only one that thinks the masks from Rob Zombie’s halloween movies are way better/scarier? The mask in these last 2 movies is like a joke..
Evil didnt died that night 😕
All I can say is that no one knows how to aim for shitttttttt. Had me watching this movie in the theatre like 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Rubbish movie. This trash movie I ever watched. I will rate 0 star for this ridiculous movie. Wasted my money & time.
Wait is this the real trailer
Lol,how possibly you cannot kill just one fucking guy.this is  BS.
Worse Halloween movie ever what a embarrassment to the ones from years ago
I personally disapprove of this movie. Great acting, special effects, and music. However it is over the top with some scenes, mostly a guy jumping off a 4-5 story building, landing head first, and having the camera capture all the details of his disarrayed corpse and brains hanging out while lying in a bloody pool on the ground. I get it, it's an invisible serial killer on the loose, but having a scene uncut with that is too far.
if he see me ima just say get me 🤷🏽‍♀️
I was wondering how he was gonna live through this 😂
Such a bullshit.
WoW 👍
i’m going right now
I wanna watch that movie today At the movie theater
Tttttttttyy
havent watched the film but i noticed the cool soundtrack. anyone knows its name at 1:26?
Alot of people complaining about the stupidity of the characters: I guarantee you if put in a situation where someone is legit trying to murder you, all sense of reason is out the door, Adrenaline takes over and you will not act how you think you will. You operating at a base level of understanding in that moment .
And that why police is not the first responder 😂🤷‍♂️
This sucks DO NOT WATCH IT worst movie ever ahah
Very disappointed.
Literally the worst movie I've ever seen. Worse than Battlefield Earth. Not even interesting.  Just annoying, poorly shot, poorly acted, poorly written.  Unbelievably boring and stupid.
I love it !!!!
Theater better than on the phone it was awesome I went n I loved it all can't wait for the next one !!!!!
Masterpiece go c it everyone in the theater
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMcMNKRuFds 🤣😂🤣
This movie is so good! One of the best.
It's look like screem
At this point even a nuclear bomb wouldn't be much of a thing
Over 8 million pumpkin wasted food just in UK. Those who waste food like pumpkins don't really for a starving child, imagine how lives can be saved but you be a slaves of humans and own desires and not the One who has created you. Return back to your maker and ask for forgiveness its not a joke. Maybe now your laughing but tomorrow you die alone after that your body guards are not there. Every action you will be held according.
lol i really love scary movies nd dis is ma fav😁😁🔥🔥
This movie sucks shit save your money
🔥
WORST movie ever !  The real Halloween movies are those created by Rob Zombie, not this total crap !
Fuck you for not allowing us to buy or rent through Amazon Video other online rental sites and we have to wait a few years? The only way to watch it is at movie theaters or through your stream services and subscription?  You joking? I'm an honest guy but I will do what I gotta do and just watch the movie free the shady way.
My opinion, Laurie: Evil dies tonight! (Stays in the hospital the WHOLE movie) She was a shero in the original movie (1978) but now she LAZY
This was such a horrible movie, so fake.. 2 bad, really was looking forward to see this one.
Économisez de l'argent : n'allez pas voir ce film de merde
Happy halloween!
This looks stupid and boring, more like a comedy horror. Movies now are so boring, dislike.
michael myers can’t die unless the director wants to
Crap movie. He get's hit with bricks, stabbed, shot at,  yet still manages to walk away and keep killing. He must be a Cat with 9 lives.
Happy Halloween. 🎃 🔪
I have seen it twice already. Bloody awesome. Literally
Was not impressed by the movie
#fuck universal studios. I want my data back
Its shit a total waste of a good movie  , the first one is still easily the best. I'm gutted I used 0.50GB watching this shit,  fucking disgraceful and as bad as Halloween 3
this looks like a great movie but how is he not dead yet omg
How stupid of them to go into Michael's house one by one and gets killed. The whole town will not be enough in this case. And I guess Michael will have to travel to the next town once he is done with this place which will probably happen in 2022. I just wonder where he will go.
I already watched the movie I liked it
I've seen it i love it and it's awesome of how Michael kills Tommy and his gang instantly
Jason > Michael
Everyone seems so stupid in this movie, cant they just cut his head off
One OF the stupidest dumbest sequel nobody needed.clumsy writing and directing.THE QUESTION IS WHY?
amazing movie 10/10
did anyone ever try national guards ?
This movie sucked!!!!!another bad Halloween  sequel.
What happen if this man learns and Start running
Michael knew better to not run with a sharp object, how do you think hes so good at killing?
I killed Michael myers last October cause I tested positive for covid
A moment of silence for everyone who paid to watch this. I felt like watching the final film in the Scary Movie franchise.
I do not like the ending of this movie 👎
why the fuck do these kids want the firefighter scene removed, its a perfect scene for the movie
"Michael's gone!" "We got him." "We burned him to the goddamned ground!"
Way to spoil the whole movie... 😪
Wtf.. garbage movie! Terrible acting! Terrible quality filming. This was rubbish and a total waste of money.
It was disappointed especially the ending
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXjH3zEqgX4&t=367s micheal myers in italy
Felm garing, plot kaga jelas,
just watched this just now, let me just say the pure stupidity of the townfolk, not killing when they had so much opportunity to kill him, like the one scene with the nurse cosplayer just not shooting the fking deagle when she had chance when she escaped the car (good she died by shooting herself), or most of the town gathering to try kill him but fail because they dont grasp they mere concept of how immortal he is, like JUST SHOOT HIM when his putting on his mask and all they had was bats and sticks? This couldve been good if it wasnt for the shitty cyberpunk launch day npcs they always have in these horror movies
MOŻE BYĆ
what a stupid movie!
They need to DETAIN him in a room so that he cant everrrrrrr get out.
Big John and Little John need their own movie.
Let me get this straight, he was stabbed multiple times everywhere, his fingers were shot, he was hit by a bat and he was burned alive, he was hit by a car, he was pushed off the stairs, he was shot a couple of times in the back, he was stabbed by a fork knife. And yet this mafaka just walks it all off 💀
Worst movie ever been directed or created. Who doesn’t run when seeing death? A high school student can even create this film, and he’s not like a god too, but he won’t die. Funny me. 😂😂😂😂
1:33 the special effects for this film is horrid, you can clearly tell its fake
I won't ever watch this trash again are even buy it
She better get his ass this time😭
This movie is just too god damn bad
Honestly the movie was ok. But Michael was more aggressive. I guess he was tired of the bullshit and actually snapped lmao. He came for everyone's necks... Literally.
they had more than one opportunity to actually  kill him...am i only one underwhelmed by this movie?
Are you kidding me?!?
Está película y la del 2018.  Es la continuación de la 1 y 2 película que salió. Las otras películas no tienen nada que ver con esta.
This movie basically proved Michael Myers is Immortal
He just like a whole town against me ? I don't care i kill em .
So he gets mad for not being able to go trick or treating as a kid witch disturbs him  so he kill his family and the thrill of that takes over his young child mind and imagination  His thrill of killing is suppose to represent his abandoned childhood he never really got to enjoy on Halloween so every Halloween he does his idea of trick or treating 🤔
As a firefighter I do not approve of this trailer, but I do have to commend it for having an accurate depiction of a structure fire
Damn,that was very graphic.I did not expect that.
Man, I'm so glad I didn't watched the trailer before the movie, they show some of the best deaths and literally the final scene, wtf?
So the trailer shows the full movie. Nice
This movie is full of shit. Don't watch it.
Dumbest movie in the history of movies....same shit different year!!! what a pos movie....an idiot that wont die no matter what.... how bout a bit of reality no??? you guys are milking this way too much....to those who havent seen it!!! dont it suck!!! huge waste of time...keep your money people!! trust me!!
Hopefully the studio will see how much of a loss it was and will not do a final film, honestly Michael is in the category of Freddy and Jason he is an icon in the "immortality realm" of characters to kill him would be a sin, and the next one will end with Michael and Jamie lee characters dying together.
Hope y’all liked my movie
Michael be carefull johnny sins it is coming for you
The moment you realize the original Halloween made for $325,000 is still superior.
Funniest movie ever
Everyone in the movie just stupid🤣
Nice,more suspense than the other Halloweens.more anger and plot change
It was so boring glad I watched online and skipped to almost the ending 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆
This film is BAD.... The script is trash and the acting is the same. Absolute garbage
Just saw the movie.Big bs.
i thinks it's too sadistic, i hope kids busy with their games
Horrible movie. Rides purely off nostalgia factor. It seems satirical, like watching a film from the “scary movie” comedy series
JSMH.  Homosexuals are not except from getting killed in a horror movie and I'm tired of seeing super white girl sabe the day.
This movie was horrible and the acting is   terrible. I can’t stress how fuckin bad it was. Who directed this shit?
Xdccf
You can chalk this movie up with the rest of the Halloween movies that shouldn't even be in the franchise like 3, 4, 5, 6, Resurrection and now this trash. Don't waste your time.
You know what.. I really enjoyed this film! More kills, more brutalities! :)
The worst one. 👎 It was funny actually. They were all sooooo dumb and literally let themselves be killed 😂  An embarrassment to the francise.
Obviously the cops 👮‍♂️ are harassing black and brown people 🤔. They won't show up to kill this mother fucker 🙄!
This film was garbage
This is a terrible film. So much so that it reflects badly on everyone involved, both professionally and personally.
Some of us got together to watch this....we were surprised at how bad it was. Did everybody else watch the same shitshow we did? There were parts where we were laughing, it was so bad.  Its truly terrifying they may make another
The movie was a bit bad tbh everyone who watched in the theatre was bored
This was THE WORST movie I've seen so far
So it’s basically a little more scary version of scream
Little John: Where are you Big John? BIgJohn: I'm on the john.. LJ: On the what? BigJ: John LJ: What?  Michael:  -_- 🔪 plz come to closet
This movie was fuckin amazing 👏
I was really enjoying this movie a lot until it turned out that he was still alive at the end and just stood up and killed all those people like it was nothing . It just seems like the creators of the Michael Myres movie series want this series to be endless like if people with knifes can’t kills him, People with bats can’t kill him, people with all type of guns can’t kill him, that means he can never die. So at this point they should announce the series as supernatural horror because at first it was realistic horror but now that they are portraying Michael as this thing that can never die is just getting boring and makes him seem seem like some supernatural non human monster and not just a serial killer.
How does he never die 💀
the funny thing is that this movie would have been a 7-8/10, but the characters were sooo retarded which made it like a 4/10
Movie with great shock value. Really enjoyed it
This movie was fucking annoying
Also he doesnt run because he doesnt need to, he has healing factor and his victims trow themselves at him, so why run when they impale themselves in your weapons?
Big Spoiler Alert, the trailer is the full movie! I mean the movie is an hour and a half of this, but the trailer is really the full movie, it even explains plot pieces like michael surviving the fire by staying inside me gun racket behind the metal door, laurie satying in the hospital because she didnt knew michael was alive and then beeing forced to stay there by the mob, and her family tracking michael down and he ending up surrounding by a mob of survivors, that he kills because he has wolverins healing factor! I mean its the hole movie in less than 3 minuts. And we learn so much about horror, that monsters have healing factor fueled by killing. Fcking Amazing. Now less sarcastic, its a good gore movie that unfortunatlly shits on everything that his predecessor did before, so it polarized people.
Dude I am so done with these movies now. I am sick of watching the same thing happen over and over. I really thought this would be the one they finally kill him but nooo. Every fricken time they have him down they stop short. Nobody wants to go too far but that is literally what it would take. I have always been a fan, you know rooting for Michael but now I am rooting for someone to have the guts to finish him. It's just not fun anymore.
They keep flogging a dead horse. Very one since the 1978 original was shit. This will continue on that path.
Pre mababad trip ka sa ending biglang kinagat ni deadpool si michael myers napasa yung powers nya i wont translate this in english.
Was a bit disappointed. Wouldn’t watch again.
Honestly, someone needs to say to these movie companies that less is more in their trailers. Too many deaths were revealed.
I watched this last night wow it was amazing 😎😊 I loved it ...I felt bad for how that dark lady died 😫, but it was amazing ..... Next year they should bring out another one with him dying i really think michael myers mask gives him more strength to kill and without it he's more weak!!!
This man still stuck in the era where running was still not invented
The movie isn't that great . Thee characters are  Dumber than usual in this 1. Michael Myers fights a big crew of firemen samurai style which is cringe lol. He lives in the end
freddy krueger vs jason vs this dude, who wins?
I feel like I'm one of the only people who saw this film and actually liked it. I was so hyped for this film and then going to watch it last night, halloween night made it even more exciting. This movie more than lived up to my expectations. I adored this film. As soon as it ended I SO badly wanted Halloween ends to be out now as well so I could see what happens next. Amazing soundtrack, as creepy and epic as ever. Solid 8.5/10 film it was basically a continuation of the 2018 film. That movie was awesome in my opinion and so naturally this one is too. Honestly I can't really see why everyone else is hating on it.
The movie in a nutshell* Large group of people: Hey let's kill Michael Myers! But we can only attack him one by one. And in the off-chance we do take him down, let's not kill him with a decisive blow to the head.
Old haloowen are the. Best this one especially sucks
Worst movie EVER 😩😂
Terrible terrible terrible film.
Hey
This renewed music is so good
Watched this film last night , absolutely loved it one of the best horror films I've ever seen , can't wait for Halloween end's.
Movie is a stink fest. Send this to hell with him
L
BAD MOVIE
Just watched the new one and it is pretty good…. I love it how they never finish him 😂 and the way he just walks…
If Michael Myers kill someone I can shoot Michael Myers
So he's a supernatural character now, or just pure evil. Loved the movie
Movie sucked so badly i walked out even before it ended
Stupid movie! I saw and I hated! Just one more movie of Michael! Anyway…
I want to see this movie...
wowsers
This movie was fucking horrible!!! Wth happend?? The 2018 Halloween was great but this was the worst one ever made in my opinion! 👎👎
Went to see it wat a pile a shite film is shite
Honestly one of the best Halloween films. Referring to the theme of Halloween and the movie franchise. It was a great film. Really good. Wasnt long, nor short. Gave us rich context and boy did Michael looked scary.
His mask has holes, so he catches COVID and finally dies.
I went to the movie theatre with literally zero expectations, I thought it was just going to be a middle film, a filer, between 2018 and Halloween Ends, but I was delightly surprised. It had a lot of elements and small details linked with both the 1978 and 2018 films. I love that it's all about concepts of fears, frustrations, mass hysteria, good/evil, the violence everyone has inside, etc. I just wish old Michael had the same semi-long hair he had in 1978 but in white tho.
Watched the movie, and I just cant believe people still watch this. I mean seriously what is the point of such movies, he is unkillable, not scary at all, movie is full of plot holes and cliches... Like wtf
This was worse that a random B rated TV movie.
Shit movie
Man women are more scary
The ending is daft af like usual lol
I mean come on. No one can shoot a gun. No one can get out of a car and run. And you actually want Myers to kill everyone. Good grief.
Happy Halloween too you 🎃♥️🎃♥️🎃♥️🎃♥️boooooo🎃♥️
a really bad movie 🙄
Who else is excited for the new movie?
yet again another Halloween movie that ruined Michael Meyers for an original fan.
This movie really disappointed…. They shouldn’t make anymore Halloween movies at this point. The original is still the best version!
Shoot
I saw this the other day, what a load of trash lol
Stigazziii!🤣
SPOILER ALERT   I'm glad they killed Allyson's ex-boyfriend, he died stupidly lol.
this was impressively bad
pambata potangena
walang dating mga actor
la kwenta taragis na movie yan
korni niyo
Not gonna spoil anything but this movie in my opinion was fantastic until the ending..... the ending changed my whole thought on this movie because they could have done multiple other things🤦‍♂️
These mfs had the audacity to 'hunt' michael myers
Is this worth watching
just finished watching, without any spoilers they have just turned him into jason tbh... I watched this today hoping for at least a jump scare or something but no... nothing... not scary at all like the originals were and I think the reason why is because they are trying to fight him.... the ppl doing these new movies suck tbh... you're supposed to be scared of him and all they keep doing is going "we're gonna get him blah blah" and it takes away from the atmosphere... you're not supposed to go after him.. he's supposed to stalk you and you're supposed to be fighting for your life to survive.
Putangina!! Ang panget ng ending bwiset! Sinaksak na at binaril buhay pa din! Tanginang yan! 😂
Jaime Lee aren’t you sick of this role?I bet staying fearful ofMichael all these years you needed a lot of therapy.
Bruhh are the ppl in horror movies that stupid call the danm military like holy shit
Spoiler free review after literally just watching it:  8/10 Great movie with terrible ending and everyone in the town is a complete idiot
I mean i like these movies but how hard is it to shoot the man
why didnt I see this earlier???
Fantastic movie 🎃👺🔪
Horrible Movie.   This is a B rated horror movie.  Director just butchered this Halloween movie.
Worst Halloween movie, Don't waste your time watching this movie. The story structure was not natural and unbalanced, there were many things like a childish plus bad ending.
Michael is a gay 😡😡
i'm dissapointed. this movie sxcks.
This is the stupidest shit I have ever watched. I’m so sick of town full or moron movies. This shit is no where near practical at all. It wasn’t even fun, it’s supposed to be fun!!!!!  I’m sure some writer is smart enough to place him into a practical setting and still tell a compelling story. I’m so done with this shit
I love fucking devil 😂
The movie sucked
He walks so dang fast
Worst acting and performance I've seen in a mega-cult franchise. Simply the worst acting I've seen since since watching the FX channel circa 2001. Extremely cheesey.
Terrible(;´༎ຶٹ༎ຶ`)
This shit was really good and gory!
Happy Halloween Eve♥️🎃
just say no kill thenthen he no kill u
This is actually an entertaining comedy movie, you watch how dumb and funny the characters are and die by Michael's hands
Now imagine a running  Michael Myers😳😆
\ halloween card= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4V6bqkhkKA
The movie sucked tbh waste of money
How is the nurse in this movie but she dies in Halloween H20 years later crazy
Only if they had more pallets
I just saw this movie now. It's horror than the devil himself
My name is michael
The original was the one worth to watch. These others are just for money making.
It’s okay, she got decisive strike
Watched this movie tonight in Coventry with my partner and my brother, it was brutal but absolutely fabulous, Michael Myers has always been my favourite all time serial killer
Will he ever die?
Michael Jason Myers
Jason Voorhees vs. Michael Myers
*For those who have not seen yet the movie.... Just a small spoiler. He doesnt even die at all. (Edit.. thanks for 300likes)*
This movie is an embarrassment to the franchise. Absolutely awful. 👎
Fun fact those firefighters that played in that scene were actual firefighters. Not sure from what city tho
The reason why i like because this movie has a nice retro 80's and begining of 90's feeling.  Very good Mike Myers Halloween horror. I will watch again and again 🎃
I have a feeling that Michael is going to be the last man Standing in Halloween ends. He's going to walk around with strodes head in his hand and kill who's left and then  he will disappear till the 50th anniversary. Evil never dies
This is going to be the first Michael Meyers movie that I've seen 😂😁
I love Halloween kills alot it just needs less Anthony Hall he still reminds me of a big dork that developed a beer belly. Everyone knows Anthony Michael Hall as a nerd not a big tough guy. No more Anthony  Hall PLEASE
I love at the end of the movie she was basically telling the guy in the hospital that Michael is not human anymore
I like the movies,  but ffs how difficult can it be to kill one man with a freakn knife. Just blast his ass with a big shotgun in his face or something idk😂
I’m really so hype for the final chapter I told my parents I kept begging 🙏 to see the final chapter I told them that’s gonna be my second birthday wish because who really gonna experience kids this watching the last famous franchise from the 70s on theater My parents wore grew up in the 70s and they know only famous actress Jamie lee Curtis
welp shit im gonna have to see this
We are in 2021 and people still act stupid? you see a killer, you open a door and run away you dont stare at him!!!
😬Never saw this 🎬One.. Now I am😉 (30.10.2021)
This is the best Michael I've seen! The flashback scenes were seamless! Well done! I'd say the best since the original!
The 1978 original and subsequent movies were  great. Zombie’s version was very good. But the others are boring recycled trash. Sad!
I will never die I always kill
I never had high expectations on this series. This sure is one of the coolest MM but how does the acting gets so bad from a movie in 2021? Michael and Curtis's acting was great and the kills were awesome. But how each and every person who were attacking him and the reactions of how they were being attacked without fighting at all seems like the really bad acting from the early 80s? None of the kills seems to make sense at all... most of them had a really good shot or distance from Michael as they were attacking then the next second just jumped to Michael stabbing and they just froze. Whyyyyy?
Watching this movie today so excited
Jamie Lee is such a awful actress.
The best thing about this movie is that they still get the actual actress in the 1978 movie, which make it seems like she’s really suffering this life in real time.
Definitely seeing this
Felt like the ORIGINAL HALLOWEEN again from the minute it started. This series will always be one of the best and to use characters from the original was genius....also if anyone noticed the masks on the merry go round were from Halloween 3 Season of the Witch, just another added fact for newbies to the phenom. Micheal Myers was as evil and brutal as ever. This is a must see for those who have only heard the name Michael Myers...
This movie sucks. One of the most horrible movies I’ve seen... everyone is this film is stupid af. They all run to their death.
Buffy vs michael myers would make a great netflix limited series
props to the camera guy who risked his life to film this
Legit curious question… While watching this, did anyone else get the feeling that they were watching a funny or die comedy sketch? One thing that I have noticed about this film and its predecessor, is that while they are better than other sequels previously made in this franchise, they feel more like fan films than proper installments.
I've watched it and I was happy that the movie still continue to next chapter. I hope it can survive for a long time
For the love of God, let it die already...
All Michael really wanted was a beer and a chance to talk to the ladies..  he couldn't find that, that's what made him go mad.
Damn...I never saw this movie advertised.
Katatapos lng panoorin. Si michael lang yata ang may utak sa movie na to, lahat sila mga bobo tangina haha
This is a brilliant film! It deals with Michael Myers's societal revenge, his fears and how he over comes them. More importantly, the ending is NOT what you think it is!!! If you pay attention to the details through out the movie, especially the huge hints with Laurie Strobe's treatment in the hospital with what happened in Halloween 2018 and the original Halloween; the ending is not what it seems! Pretty cool stuff if you take time realize what is really going on! BTW, the Easter Eggs in this are great touches!
Can we please have this movie released in Australia. None of our streaming services will play it and we don't have it at cinemas either because of COVID19.  Some of us would like to watch it. If you won't make it available then you are asking us to rip it off a torrent. Don't lose that money. Just release it on one of the digital stores in this region.
oh my God
Guys, I swear to god. This is a slasher comedy. Its so hilariouss that you can kill them with a cordless phone. They are turning him into Jason Friday the 13th.
Waste of money .
Trash movie tbh
I’m disappointed in this movie. It was boring. Characters were dumb who stays in the house to investigate??!? Lolll
Please stop ruining this legendary franchise leave Micheal alone. I mean i've watched a lot of Halloween movies in the past and it's frustrating the fact he doesn't die he is a fucking person, he is not Jason . Yeah of course he is a killer and his talent is killing, but just let him stare out of the fucking window!
I wanted Stuart to grab a knife and say "I wanna do it!"
evil wins...kinda like the empire strikes back of the Halloween franchise
The story is very dark for a horror movie
It was so good we had a special time in the cinema
I really liked the movie. Micheal was a badass. If you want to see Michael in action this movie will not disappoint.
Michael should be in Expendables 4
Cut him in small pices then problem solve idiots producers money makers
BORING SAME STORY AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN
The whole movie in a nutshell: Stupid people getting killed for doing stupid things. Imo Halloween 2018 is the best after the first Halloween. This movie is too diversified and I would rather they choose to focus on just fewer characters like they did in 2018, which would be the icing to the cake in terms of storytelling and plot.
This is verry stupid movie..
Terrible.
Op
I dont think Michael can feel.
I love how everyone just when they get the chance to kill Michael just softly hit him a few times on his back and then be like finaly we killed him :D Seriously that happens in every god damn movie with a killer   if i was one of those town people i had smashes his skull into 1000 pieces or atleast cut his head off.
Top 10 must watch movies this Halloween https://youtu.be/WVN01uII6co
Crazy how “homophobic” he is for killing ONE gay couple. Might as well cancel Pennywise too while you’re at it cause he ate a gay person
so this movie isn't very good I've heard..  we'll see about that!
Can I have my 1 hour 45 minutes back, never seen such non sense..
everyone who had a gun in the movie seem ed to have max aim speed sensitivity and they are not used to it
Have been in love with this series forever now I’m seeing it today can’t wait 🤘🏻
michael myers try killng me will my AR 15 goodluck buddy
The representation of black people in this film, is insulting and disrespectful, That shit is so fucking false it baffles me, and I am white, Yep Hollywood once again got it wrong.  From the dialogue of the stuff they were saying to the decision making....and then A MOB? GTFOH! I am done
In case you haven’t already wasted your time watching this woke TRASH 🗑 do yourself a favor and skip this one. Very cheesy and by far the worst in the franchise
Somebody answer my comments!
Shut your blowpipe and why is this day going by so god damnnie slowie
Ameer you look ridiculous in that outfit
A ridiculous movie .. not worth watching! ..
I HAVE BEEN WAITING SINCE 2018 FOR THIS I AM SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO EXCITED.
No matter how fast you run, no matter how far you go once you see Michael Myers its over for you.
Even for a kid, this movie just sucks 😂😂 nobody knows to take a one direct  shot at him, nobody can't stab him even he doing things slow...he walks slowly after killing a cop while watching other officer 😂😂 why people can't beat his ass as a team, they are getting killed because they fight one at a time 🤣🤣 Scream franchise was way better than this....ohhh wait in the end he just raisen from the dead,is Michael a zombie 😂😂 cursed my ass 🤣
I'M SO EXCITED!!!
Moral of the story: evil did not die that night
he should have drop the fucking pallet.
Omfg it was awesomeee
What a load of shite this movie is
*IDC what anyone says against this film... Halloween Kills is a good movie!*
bad movie .... they kilt him ....,. chopt his head off and still he comes back .... its time to put a rest to this movie ... bad cast bad senens..... michale myers is done ...... realy bad movie
Don't care what the purist's say this was great !!!
I enjoyed this Michael didn't come play.... If he killed her daughter the next one going to be something else... Mike went crazy in the kitchen😅😅😅😅😅 finding perfect knife😅😅😅
Twelve Halloween movies? Where do I begin from? Which one? 🙄
I want to puke , i watched the movie and its it like no trilling at all 0...
All the characters in these movie are DUMB as Fuck, except for Michael Myers
I thought he died in the last one? He's like Terminator now.
Evil dies tonight!  SPOILER ALERT,  no it doesn't
Just whatched this day after releas, great movie and the suspension is all throughtout the movie.
How does this man survive gunshots, eye jabs, stabs and all other stuff jurors such as falling from tall heights without any medical attention
ehene, kajmán film lesz tuti
Enough with this trash please.
This film ended up being a unintentional So many funny scenes and line deliveries
i know its holloween, but why is a dude in a dress in the opening scene? lol.
And for the love of all things holy, make Myers someone he was in the original movie? Oh Halloween Kills bombed.... no shit, you turned him into a Friday the 13th villain. "Oh, that's a good idea" Wow.  I like how DGG directed this new film but ... ahhg, it like Halloween 2 still exists.  This film makes more sense if Halloween 2 did exist. It makes no sense that it does not. Peoples reactions to some guy killing 3 or 4 people 40 YEARS AGO, not gonna have the same effect as Michal Myers going on a H1-H2 rampage -- that would never be forgotten.  They said they had a plan of three movies all along. Hmm, I think not. They barely put this together.  Just want the Gordon Green thing over with, dp Halloween Ends see how lame that will be and then maybe someone else with some talent will get the job. Someone who knows Myers, although Green did great, he's talented, but... Halloween?  He's better than most.... he does never do the Myers fade in from dakrness scene so that' a sin.  So no, I would actually vote against Gordon Green to do another Halloween movie, I think he's blown it. Certainly not write one. Him and his team have come up with this, Halloween 2018 and Halloween Kills... Yup. Worrying. It's gonna be the same shit.  Yet another director that just does not get the point of what make Michael Myers scary.   I know why they substitute gore and violence, it's because they can't come up with anything else. Brain-dead when it comes to suspense/ The people hired to write these movies are not known for making clever films. They make brain-dead stoner movies. Not quite lowest of the low but we're on that pole.
Who gonna watch Halloween kills ? Cuz I am please comment and tell me if it starts in 2022 cuz I forgot please  tell me
Ngl the movie kinda trash
I wish Micheal would've just stayed flesh and blood.  A.k.a human
Mike Myers has changed a lot since his Austin Powers days 😁
Película basura
Here's a parody of Halloween Kills: https://youtu.be/WNiTiHIKv_c
This movie just went to far. Same old shit.  Ain't  worth the time!!
EVIL DIES TONIGHT. More of a LOGIC DIES TONIGHT.
Hope straw hat luffy can take him down..
Yeah, let me toss out everything that can go through my skin from the house.
10years from now michael will be in a zimmer frame........he's gotta be in his late 70s by now🤔
daaam this movie gotta be 18+
If Michael Myers is such a stain on Haddonfield, why don’t they just knock the house down?
I liked the movie but I can’t get over the fact that without his mask he’s bald and is probably in his 60s by now
It seems i hv watched whole movie in this trailer
Fun fact: Laurie isn't Michael's sister in this timeline. Just a random babysitter who fought off a serial killer. Makes him feel more ominous
This is a good movie no cat
so apparently Michael dies, then fucking goes /gamemode 1 and kills 10 people, then does /tp me karen and kills her.        yeah I know, makes sense.
This guy can survive anything like james bond
Bro Even If they blast A Nuclear Bomb on Michael He Will Still Survive It Like Wtf😂
Look I got to sleep tonight
Note to self: do not become a fire fighter
*This movie was fucking stupid. Even by slasher flick standards. The victims did everything they did to die.*
who is the strongest psychopath? Michael or Jason
shit movie don't watch it 🤮
This shit could’ve aired on Comedy Central
Hated the movie!
I respect universal 10 times more then I did before. I mean they killed a gay couple. Respect
Besides the firemen everyone else more or less deserved it 😆
ABSOLUTE JUNK , when is this CRAP going to END
Just watched the one before this. This film was written, that screenplay got purchased and a studio put up money. It had extensive pre production and then went into filming. Actors were paid, costume, stunts, make up etc etc LOADS of work and a long time and at no point did anyone say. "Do you know what? This is fucking dog shit. Let's not bother".
This movie puts all the "stupid horror film decisions" together and made a sequel out of it. All the "scary" moments are literally jump scare. Halfway through this thing, I got pissed off because some of the characters are just freaking stupid. And the old couple's death pissed me off too(it had nothing to do with the plot and I think its there just to make the film it 90 minutes). Fxxk the retarded director who put together this sequel you just wasted my time. By the looks of the ending, it seems that they will be making a 3rd movie. Don't bother watching any of it its just a big horror film cliche mashup.
Trailer looked fucking badass, Cant wait to watch this shit
The movie was ok but a bit over rated,  this wasn't as action packed as we hoped, the directors and creators went for too much drama in a horror film which didn't quite work well.
Michael Myers’s kills everyone regardless of gender. It’s ignorant to accuse him of being homophonic due to the content of a movie. Get over yourself murder is what he does and who he is.
DOES NO ONE WANNA KNOW HOW HE GREW HIS FINGERS BACK?!?!?! AM I THE ONLY ONE THATS CONFUSED!?!?!
So they basically restarted the whole movie over again.
Worst Halloween movie I have ever seen. Someone made millions off this shitstain....... total ripoff and a huge slap in the face to the fans. I wont be paying to see the next one. Instead I will watch Halloween Resurrection!
This man is 100% evil, he leaves a path of killing, he kills everything even kids 😰
I'll save you guys some money: film was absolute trash.
Why does he literally never die
He should get a cut from the profits made on that infamous mask.
The more he KILLS, the more he transcends.
I heard this one was "Woke." I guess Michael is Gay & gets a boyfriend 😂
No matter how much you run you need to know that evil isn't about fire its about burning in a house
Shit, this was a terrible movie!!!
If micheal learns to run were fucked
For Someone Who Spent His Whole Life.... CATATONIC... He Walks Faster Than My Grandma Drives a Car!!
Michael had multiple opportunities to take the sidearm of a police officer he killed. He never takes the gun. He prefers knives even though he knows others have guns. A cool, calculating killer like him would take the gun. For 40 years he never takes the gun. You'd think that they'd switch it up this time. And, just like all the other times, we don't have a definitive confirmed kill on Michael at the end of the movie.    This leaves the door open for yet another idiotic sequel.  They should kill him, Cut his body into six pieces. Burn him to ashes. That would be a more satisfying climax. It's time for Hollywood to invent a new slasher goon.
This movie was so good
This movie was more like a comedy. Every person in this movie except for Michael can't do shit right. 🤡🤦🏻‍♂️

One of the shitty movies I've ever seen👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
This was the worst movie ive ever seen
🔥🔥😭
Horrible movie. It has lost its purpose and you will find out that afterwards...
I lost the count on the killings on the movie.. EASYLY 40 people.  To be honest, I want to see the third movie.
The comment section rocks !!!!!! 😂
Of course he lives again SMH, I'm not watching the next one that's for sure I'm done. Can't believe they've stretched this movie out for this many years. I killed Michael Myers because I'm not watching anymore, same old shit.
Written by a 12 year old Directed by a 10 year old  Maybe enjoyed by 8 year olds. Ham acting at its finest. Jamie Lee Curtis looks scarier than Michael. 90 minutes I’m never getting back
Mike’s got some real work ethic tho  Guy never stops hustling
The story not much different when you saw tom and jerry,...  the way Michael never get die after all the stab,the shoot,the burn,etc, without explaining what is he???  is he somekind of possessed.., zombie or half human and machine???
Laurie hates Michael because last birth both are husband and wife and her husband divorced her because she always beat him .
When I was watching this film I was eating pancakes, because they give me the crêpes
Michael be like: Bitch I'm back from the dead
This movie was pretty much Haloween: infinity war  With that ending.
I prayed that he would burn in hell but in my heart i knew hell would not have him.- Dr. Loomis
HAPPY HALLOWEEN ! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlim8BxAVNk
almost as bad as halloween 6 so disappointing..
Y’all the first Halloween movie came out in 1978, meanwhile 43 YEARS LATER. Micheal has survived being shot in the face, lit on fire tons of times. ETC, ETC. AND HE’S NOT DEAD, NOTHING IS WORKING. WHY EVEN TRY, GOING AGAINST HIM IS SUICIDE. YOU WILL DIE 100%, DO NOT TRY AT HOME. AT THIS POINT, LET THIS MAN BE PRESIDENT. HE’S A HUMAN MACHINE GUN, HE WILL BE USEFUL FOR THE ARMY USA. MAKE HIS ABILITIES USEFUL.
Came here to just state my opinion. This movie sucks ass. Just saw it. Same shit as always. Stupid as hell in my opinion
Terrible movie.From very first scenes that take us back to the night of first Halloween till very end.I hope they end it right here,it's becoming laughable how unrealistic executed scenes are,sub par acting,terrible dialogue.Complete 0!
80% of the people who died in this movie would have easily survived if they had just minded their own damn business and let Michael stare out that window LOL
One of the worst crap of a movie I've ever watched they need to stop the franchise It's TIRED..not worth the wait
These movies are just getting out of hand now
Anyone tried shooting him?
Watched it. It sucked like a vacuum
My grandma once out walked Michael Myers in a push walker, on grass. She survived to tell the story 😂
The music on the trailer not being nostalgic-  had me  iffy- look good though, Jamie lee on set- Ahhhh, bad as sht is going to happen.
I enjoyed the movie, and no one can tell me otherwise!
Michael Myers only kills on halloween
JLC entire screen time is shown in this trailer. “Hey can you come back?” “Can I do all my shots in 2 days and never leave the hospital?” “Ya sure”. “IN!”
I haven’t seen the movie, but it seems pretty stupid that Michael was able to kill a bunch of firefighters who were grouped up together. Even if they wouldn’t be able to kill him, they could’ve easily all escaped and survived. Also, IDK who called 911 because Laurie’s house was in the middle of nowhere so there couldn’t have been anyone there to call them.
I think people who disliked this movie so much clearly didn't understand what this movie was doing. I mean, it's right on the title— Halloween Kills. It is all about Michael and how his art in killing affects the people and the town.  It is all about the kills. And I loved it. In a way I see this as the Michael's revenge kind of vibe.
Halloween is coming, not even yet seen, incld Rob Zombies version. HALLOWEEN MOVIES must watch when is Halloween 🎃💀👻
This is the worst movie i ever seen how can anyone with a single brain cell enjoy this or think its good? I remember the classics being good no idea wtf this shit is
And now the the population in the world has been cut in half .
Hes back, he never dies🔥
All Mike wanna do is go home and look out the window lol
One of it not the worst movie i’ve ever seen
I hate you Michael😒🥺
When that patient committed suicide i fucking cried because they thought he was Michael 😭😭😭😭
Watched the Movie and this trailer was still so flipping good !
..and in the next halloween movie he chases people with his old rusty walker.  however, the movie is recommended to all loyal halloween fans. 😀❤️
All fun games till Micheal starts running
for real dude could’ve dominated the NBA for half a century but chose the wrong slashing smh…
This looks exciting.
whos here after hearing lgbt is trying to cancel michael for being a homophobic coz he killed a gay couple?
I have been a huge Myers fan for 15+ years but I was disappointed when i watched this vid today. It was like watching Jason Voorhees with a Myers mask on. Blood and gore all over the place. What happened to the buildup atmosphere and intensity that the old originals mastered so perfectly? And what’s up with all the gore? The originals had very little blood in them.  Now Myers is Jason Voorhees on steroids, cutting and killing a whole firefighter crew at the same time. The same with the gang of people that beat him down at the end of the film. Blood splattering everywhere and killed them all. This was too much. Halloween is not supposed to be a total gore film. I miss the buildup of the movie with a climax at the end, I miss the eerie atmosphere, I miss the silent killer that suddenly shows up when you are not expecting him. This was not a Halloween movie for me. They killed the charm.
They have turned him into the terminator what ever happened to scene development getting you drawn into a scene just to have Michael freak some one out then pop out and obliterate them. Now it’s like you can predict the next move and doesn’t even hold your attention he’s struggling against two white chicks like come on the dude supposed to be lifting people with one hand squeezing the life out of them.
Once you understand halloween will never be as good as it used to you’ll accept these new movies for what they are. “MAKE MICHAEL MYERS GREAT AGAIN”
https://youtu.be/tH4zQdd9gaE
Trash trash and more trash....  Dont waste your Time or Money  I love horror movies and this is disgraceful on all levels.
U really think yall have a chance when he reches tier 3😂
"Micheal Myres is alive!"  Rob Zombie: "hold my beer"
How tf did he survive that
Yessir I do walk very fast
Fucking movie was awesome 💚
Ah yes, a group of Firefighters armed with Axes and a Saw cant kill one guy
This movie was ass, i legit fall asleep watching this "horror/thriller" movie
Michael is on a different level of savage in this movie… just finished my 2nd watch through 😐😐😐
Michael just doesn't die! 😆 looks good 👍
I genuinely thought they will ruin the the film by making another one but the way they've done it, excellent.
Movie is terrible. Couldn’t even watch the whole thing. Rob Zombies “Michael Myers”movies are 100% the best out of all of them!!!
Stupid film, zero star dont watch. This is totally garbage, a man who could not die, and those person who try to kill him are worlds stupid person. What you will do if want to kill a person with bat, obviously you will hit him in head.  ... But here what we see, a team try to kill him, but killed by stupid mask man.... Shit film
I seen this film,  Its absolutely terrible.  Halloween from 2018 was very good,   However this is possible the worst film i have ever sat through
The worst film and sequel i ever seen....
One of the worst films of the year. No one will hype this franchise anymore.
This is so stupid. I just can't deal with any more of this 🤦‍♀️
4/10  Waste of time
Stop it Michael 😏
I wish they used this theme with the cello in the movie!!!
I was actually hoping his mask just melted onto his face, becoming one with his mask
Who likes halloween 🎃
No this isn't michael anymore..  This is RAMBO
These movies are just funny to watch lol
I get it but DAMN how tf is still dude still alive. I mean where is the army, swat, anybody with a bunch of guns
Fire fighter seen you I want to be fire fighter and this is interesting
the only one that Michael is scare of *THE MEXICAN MOM WITH A SLIPPER*
The movie sucks, the last one at least made sense 😜
Saw the movie and it was fucking cringey
The Boogeyman is real. OMG! HYPE!!!
10/10.
The movie felt really hurried through, and the ending was bad, they didn’t kill him AGAIN. So not only did this one suck as well, they’ll have to make another one explaining how he didn’t die.
Dem nuh tired femek diss movie
How long is this ganna be in the movie theaters for
Movie was stupid lol I laughed at how they made the whole thing and how stupid the characters were
I could make it better. Ruining the creepyness of michael by portraying him as a human and giving him more humanly effects. Ofcourse hes a human but comeon, its a horror movie.
It was meh....but He has Never been more damn handsome ...even with all those sweaty firemens.
Michael is walking too fast and over killing
Stupid movie do not waste your time
Soooooo gay
Worst Halloween in the installment history, EVER!
worst movie ever !  total waste of 1.5 gb data.  this guy never used gun but killed many cops who has guns. he even got brutally beaten up by the people but he got up and killed everyone around
I liked it, it was a little bit better than I thought it would be. But maybe just because I'm a purist it. Was nowhere near as good as any the other Halloween films.  I liked how this film try to tie I  the whole franchise.  With the franchise but over all of the the things that make the first films a pure unadulterated classic. Wasn't in this 1 for me.  7/10 for me in my opinion
I like the Halloween franchise but the current movie was filled with unnecessary things and questionable decisions. I'm sorry but this one is a total flop.
Film was shit, 80% of the film is them doing trivial things and saying how they wanna kill Michael instead of actually seeing Michael kill people, the old myer films was better
Michael isn't the essence of evil he's not even evil
Michael must be EXHAUSTED any this point. He’s been killing since 1978 for gods sake. The next one should be called Halloween Retirement Home : Murder and Medicare.
This movie made me want to go buy bats, sticks, and go to a storm trooper shooting seminar.
What is wrong with Laurie Strode ?The motherfu won't die? Fine, watch me move to the Bahamas.
Rob Zombie's remakes forever!
100% crap movie from start to end! absolute terrible cast! shame as fvck
Ayeeee this lit I went to see it yesterday with my girl 💪🏾💪🏾
This movie was embarrassing to watch. Like it was a 4/10 😂 The community coming together, the crazy guy everyone was chasing in the hospital thinking it was michael, the dumb funny ways people were dying and the girl shoots herself in the head by accident lmfao Lil Jon & Big Jon 😂💀💀💀 you guys will be so disappointed
Halloween Kills - Ressurect, kill, repeat. The most stupid and dumb sequel ever. And the sad fact is that it is going to get even dumber.
The movie is great, but it misses some things, Laurie must feel that her daughter is in danger, the mother always feels , but it could have been more wonderful, Halloween is not just a movie
I watched the older movies when I was a kid. Back then I truly believed he was a ghost, a demon, stuff like that. I was easily scared. I mean I was like 6 or something. Then I got older and realized that he's just a dude. You know what makes me scared of him all over again? Telling myself that he's not human, that he truly is a demon from hell. That he's somewhat supernatural. Who knows, maybe there is a Michael out there. Not on the outside but on the inside. Watch your backs, people.
We just finished this movie literally just now and i jst want to say Karen is soo dumb! She stabbed Michael ONCE with that fork how stupid! We all know how strong he is!? Why once only!! Im soo upset!! 😡🤬😂 I kept saying all of them are dumb 😂😂
“evil dies tonight”… how many times have you said that? Yeah right
Why is his 60 old mom winning from michael...
Michael now feels less like a serial killer, and more like Darth Vader...
The worst Halloween yet
Every Remake, of every classic has ALWAYS been shit. They don't know how to make great movies anymore.
Fuck me if American police were that stupid, the most richest people would be the ones doing illegal shit, I got pissed the fuckk off when I saw how dumb people on the movie are, they didnt just have one chance to kill him, they had a shit ton of chances FFS.........
Why can't we just get into the running car!!!
Wtf why doesn't he die in the end after like several bullet shots. Is it a joke?!
So this is comedy genre's?
Who actually watches this crap?
Michael 😨
ngl I kinda hope this is the final movie. They cant keep dragging this shit out forever
Fool.movie
"That one lady who brought an iron to fight Michael Myers" group on Facebook made me watch this movie.
When will they learn. They need to take that mask off make sure its him (🖕 h20) and cur dudes head off
Shitty movie. Doesn't deserve one star.
“Halloween in a dumb neighborhood”
Micheal Myer lives in a dumb neighborhood.
Gotta be honest.. the whole neighborhood stupid As fuck. The ending explains why.
Halloween 2018 was so good compare to this. They should have repeat the formula of Halloween 2018. This movie is all over the place. The story line and pacing is terrible. The Halloween 2018 has a great story line, you are intrigued with the lore, the cinematography is amazing, the pacing is great, the killing scenes are creative. Don't waste your time and effort with this one.
Bruh I was rooting for the people but was happy they died dumb ass people bruh literally stab him once and they stop or they get of the car or don’t run him over
Cant wait to see this!! Halloween part 4 will always be my favorite of all...
That Activia yogurt make Jamie Lee Curtis look nice for her age!!! I am proud of her, still in the game.
The best michael myers since the first one I like how they made the killing look so real best one hands down micheal is forever a goat plz keep them coming 💀🔪
Most retarded ass movie!
Thai movie is trash don’t pay to see it
Really outscares the vintage outta halloween
I never understood this. Why not get a shotgun, put buck shot in it, get it a tree stand and bring him to you. 2 shots to the chest one to the dome, it’s over.
Literalmente me dormí en el cine hace 30 minutos
Don’t watch this movie unless you like gore. The movie is shit.
Cameron :(((
Same Halloween movie crap,  waste of money.
2:18 Do it ..... DO ITTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!🤣🤣🤣
👍🏻
I disliked this movie, same as i did with the 2018 one. I will be avoiding the last one in the trilogy for sure.
Michael Myers killed all the stupid people in that town... That's why I love this movie.
shortest hour of my life
Non sence at all ,specially that flash back at the Myers house where that police guy shot the other one and he take all the blame that he is still alive ,specially when doc Loomis shot him 6 times lol
Gargamel!!
So bad movie....it is awful to watch to an old and ugly Jamie Lee!!!!
Everyone's gonna be in a lot of trouble once this man learns how to run
wow the three masks (pumpkin, skull and witch) are the ones for halloween 3
Is this movie worth watching?
True
what a crappy movie,,, such a let down..  director  sucks. b movie acting,, horrible directing,, such garbage.. good thing movie was free
1) Michael originally walked a lot slower than this fella  2) the storyline is as bad if not worse than a Freddy Kruger, but at least Freddy was comical.  3) More annoying than entertaining   4) You killed a legend  5) Glad it was free to watch on Peacock through Xfinity.
$93000 Peggy guardado payment happy Halloween Halloween 🎃  movies 🎥  men from  chasoum  Peggy diablita payment movies 1978 men
Trailer was better then the movie
Patéticamente mala
I saw "Halloween Kills" yesterday and I already have cancer.
The best part of HK was the 1978 flashback scenes including using their Art Director to play Sam Loomis because he looks like him.
Big jon and lil jon u know who was who with the 🔪 best movie i ever seen with him
This franchise is as worn out as the terminator..just stop already.
I don’t get it, the whole town can’t catch a guy. That michael is like a superhero with an iron body he even survived after several shotguns. What the hell🤣
He's a prisoner of his own demented mind!
0:43.....this just made me lol. Fireman starts his buzzsaw to try and go on the offense and fails miserably 😂😂
Very stupid movie...😶
Yo this movie was ass
This was a good movie!!
Who else was mad when they wouldn’t shoot him in the head, stab him in vital organs, or smash his head with all of their blunt objects they brought to “kill” him.
It’s so obvious how  fictional a movie is when everyone knows all they have to do to end it is call Chuck Norris.
The navy seals should have recruited Michael Myers and dropped him off in Afghanistan to hunt terrorist.
Welll I saw the movie. I understand a lot of the complaints but I still thought it was amazing. Best version of micheal on screen in my opinion.
Alice will be the next generation of evil trust me..her face resembles Michael's white mask in the car scene.
Michael singlehandedly murders the whole fire dept team at the beginning and the townpeople at the end is f*cking laughable. Annoying movie.
JUST WATCHED ITS CRAP 💩 LITERALLY HE TAKES THE MASK OFF DOESNT SHOW US HIS FACE THERE BOUTA BE ANOTHER ONE IN 40YEARS BRO ALSO HE KILLS PEOPLE IN THE MOST WEIRDEST WAYS IN THIS MOVIE
I've watched this yesterday. This movie is so goood 😍😍😍
Looks confused and bland.  This new HALLOWEEN series just doesn’t do it for me.  Zero style, zero personality, ham fisted modern “social commentary.”
BRO I SAW THIS MOVIE YESTERDAY. THIS SET A WHOLE NEW STANDARD FOR SLASHERS, PLEASE GO WATCH THIS
Bro Halloween kills was the dumbest movie in the series, this was so BAD
How did he kill a whole crew of armed firefighters? I mean if he would pick them off one by one, that would make sense, but there was 3 of them, all of them armed and athletic full grown men and they not only just stood there while he killed their friends, they didn't even try to run. They could also use the firehose that has water running under crazy pressure levels.
michael meyers next year wont be in the halloween franchise anymore, we will see him in the suicide squad😂
the movie was crap... thank god jamie lee wasn't in it as much... her acting & character is so annoying
“I’m coming for you Michael”  Laurie Stays In the Hospital for the entire movie
Hallowen rob zombie is the best
Why did everyone hate this? I thought it was great. Good fun. Saw it at the cinema yesterday night.
I'm so glad I didn't pay to watch this. It was terrible.
The ending sucked. It seems like a never ending cash grab
I love halloween best movies im form algeria 🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿😍😍😍
Bullshit,the story can be endless,seems like actor has an NPC intellect
michael is so OP. that the movie makes boring.
That film is shit i watched thta is shet
This movie was a waste of time......another classic franchise down the gutters......Boring and predictable as fuck!!!...
This is a dollar tree production movie ! i cant believe this is a 2021 movie. what a joke ! not worth the time.
Rubbish acting, rubbish movie.
I saw this movie tonight, and it was just Bad... Nothing scary at all...just gore...Shame.. Thought it  would be better than it was...  Hated seeing the firefighters get killed like that... Nobody runs from this fool.  They all think they can take him...and the line, " Evil ends tonight..." or, "Tonight we fight back.."  got so overused and became really boring to hear over and over...damn.  They couldn't do it in 40 years, why do they think they could do it then?!?  Smh
🙄🙄
Such a pointless movie. Focused too much on PC bullshit rather than an acutal plot and storyline. Acting was crap. It drags, too predictable even for a horror movie
that was not a good movie
Never give Michael Myers a ✋ up from a fire fk that
Horrible movie
Im here for Ghosts song -_-
Just watched it tonight, I think its another great classic ruined by modern liberal Hollywood.
Mike: wow warm nice fire well now to go back killing again with a 12 dollar kitchen knife
its like a loop- same story line - different actors
Brief History on Halloween  https://youtu.be/6ljizRxHVM8
This movie and series fucking sucks
This was a terrible movie
Horrible
Thats fucking acting.......Let it 🔥..look at they faces......th iz the one(youtube)
What a steaming pile of horse dung this movie was
Anyone that wants to watch the movie reply to me I know how you can watch for free just finished watching
Wow!   Saw this movie.  It has everything.  A male character wearing a dress!   A same sex couple!   There was a bi-racial couple.  Even had Jamie Lee Curtis looking like a 80 year old!   I never knew the town of Haddonfield was so diverse.
Went to see this today and was not disappointed at all. Just wish Jamie lee Curtis played a more bigger role in it
Was so disappointed with this sequel🙄🙄
Stupid ending to the film left it for another one have they not watched zombie land double tap
Mans survived a fire😂😂
Que peliculaaaa♥️♥️♥️💯💯💯👏👏👏👏👏
low budget horse shit , seriously do you intentionally tell actors to be so idiotic ! almost no story to really follow except everyone remembering the past blah blah , such a good franchise , but the people that signed of this crap really went all out .
Literally one of the worst films I've seen in years. You Halloween apologists are so fucking silly. Awful, awful, nonsensical film franchise.
This movie is comedy gold but dont go in to it expecting a horror movie there was so many god awful scenes but they were so bad that it was hilarious and for that its worth watching
Cello
This is not scary, already this is funny
Watched the movie. I’m honestly surprised Michael didn’t stretch at the end after carrying the whole movie. Literally the only good parts are him on screen.
Where's Freddy when you need him??
I hope they didn't put all the good parts into this one trailer, and the movie is 1:27 minutes of boring.
This is a film that looks good but terrible to watch due to the story line, the original film is still the best
Why he looks like joe bidenn 🤣
Worst!!! Waste of time.
So this just like... distilled the movie down and showed everything in 2 minutes.
Absolutely shit film lol
Terrible film.
What a bad movie… very disappointing
Actually it's a comedy movie from start to end.
The cinema near me is asking for id so they know of u over 18 or not so now I can't see it in cinena
Well how many times is he gonna come back! Dam he has more lives then a cat. Lol jk I love Holloween.
People say not worth watching and spending $20 at movies 😤
Is there any sexual activity in the movie
Worsts film ever even by Horror film standards. Terrible acting, awful script but well cut trailer to fool audience! Don't waste your money. poor Jaime is a one trick pony. Is this her 27th Halloween movie? Get a life Jaime!  It never ends!
This movie cracked me up more than anything😂😂😂. Wasted my time
I LOVE MICHAEL MYERS Everyone stupid in this movie!
All I got to say is that mask bitch has been through a lot over the decades
MICHAEL MEYERS NEVER DIES!! Believe it.
What a waist of time. Fits person I would kill if I was him it’s a producer, for choosing horrible cast. Honestly doctor Who is much better
SOMEONE EXPLAIN how he got shot 4 times, stabbed 7 times total and acts like nothing?
I watched the movie and loved it ❤
great movie
This sort of movies don`t work anymore...without substance, a guy killing others just because.
ive seen enough
When someone hurts the people of American land they awake the militia of uncle sam
Jaime Lee Curtis is a Pinko Commie
This movie SMACKS
No more Michael....We need new Jason!
My man almost burnt alive, got shot 5 times, stabbed another 10, hitted without mercy, but he was still alive and of course he had the energy to kill people. And of course he is 60+ years old. If he's not something supernatural, then the clownery of this scenario is real.
worst movie ever to be honest
The villain too over power
Trash!
Boring ,,,,, Sorry , please make another creative movie beside Halloween and Michael
best Halloween song :)
The so called vigilante posse were so disappointing. Like.......disappointing. 😂😂
The fire scene was cool. everything else sucked. I skipped  the stupid dialogue bits.    Oh and the women shooting herself was funny.
trash
Saw this movie last night... man it sucked
magnificent movie, but I dont watch trailers til after I see the film, this trailer ... sigh, just glad I didnt watch this,
jason where are u
Boring Film . Only noise . Run & being killed .
Tom Tucker is not Michael, i dont watch it
*Worst & BoorinG Movie Ever I wasted 2 hours of My Life For This Shit*
The Ending Trash
I was really disappointed with this movie tbh
Michael was so sexy when he came out that house😍🔪
If anyone's planning on paying to watch this movie please for the love of GOD don't. Absolutely horrendous movie
SWAT has left the chat.
J’adore Halloween films
When the sheriff baited Mike with that “one scare” line with everyone surrounding him, in my mind, Mike put his mask back on and said, “Ok. Game on.” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Gotta love Michael Myers, he doesn't discriminate against race, sexuality, or gender. He kills Blacks, Whites, Gays, Men, Women. He just end all lives that cross his path!
People do like: Plz kill me. Stupid 🤣
Horrible, but what was I expecting...
this movie was awful without JLC at the center. To keep her in the hospital was a poor decision on the writers part. What made the Halloween movie before this one so good was because Laurie was kicking ass and taking names..
This movie was comedy gold. There is literally only one way to save this movie. That would be to have Laurie wake up in the beginning of Halloween Ends and this was a morphine induced stream of conscious dream. Then this film would be considered a masterpiece. Other than that it is completely nonsensical.
The movie is a flop. #cheesy af. Such a disappointment the main actors sold out for cash. I’m a fan but damn this was disappointing. Legacy went straight down the drain. Save your money lol
Myers isn't the butcher we all love. he's the one that's been butched in this movie. Shitty tropes that you see in every day horror movies. It's sad to see a mock of
THIS MOVIE SUCKED SO BAD!!
This movie was insufferable for all the wrong reasons. You have to try pretty hard to f*** up a slasher horror film and in that regard, Liberal Hollywood succeeds.
This movie was dogshit
Rate this movie from 1/5 who has watched it. Thanks
Horrible sequel!!! Two hours and 13 dollars I'll never get back. After the great 2018 Halloween I really thought kills would be as good, I was sadly mistaken.
Don’t watch this movie the ending was so dumb and Michael is still alive so there is no point in watching something that doesn’t end
Such a waste of time this movie was, should have watched sth else 😭. All characters are brainless and bad acting. I wanted to walk away during the halftime of this movie its thats bad
This lemon has been squeezed dry of all its juice... How is it that a mentally challenged man can have 4 squad cars surrounding him at a park after a Karen calls 911 but they never send a whole department to go after a serial killer like Mikey? Movies have just lost total logic these days.
Now 3 more years and they’ll make onother one 😂
Lmao. Where tf are militants and police, FBI,Swat😭😭👹
Insufferable characters
The police in this movie is dumb do they not see Michael past newspaper
So what is he ? An unkillable zombie like Jason ?
:O WOOOOOOO NICE 🙂
the thing is the girl is losing soooo much blood i think she would be dead by then
hmmm .. if we see Godzilla vs Kong maybe will see Jason vs Myers a 1v1 with no ending :) or maybe one will be able to stop the other once and for all
You would think they would the military by now instead of local cops
The 1st 15 minutes where jaw dropping…end then they destroy the movie by putting cheesy lazy script writing….the actors were horrible…they had a golden opportunity n they botched it…fire the president of nbc, the writers n the director for this trash movie …I want my $5 dollars back for peacock…wasn’t even worth watching it for free 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ 🗑
Worst Halloween let’s just all keep it 100
Absolute shit
He just wants to kill his sister…
Just watched and I’ve literally just lost 2hrs of my life I’d rather rubbing dog shite in my eyes!!  Hands down THE worse film I’ve ever seen in my entire life!!  Whoever directed this tripe should be shamelessly disappointed and to never be allowed behind a camera ever again!!! I was literally fuming at how fucking dumb the plot was and the acting!!!  I’m so pissed right now that I watched the whole thing!!!🤬😤😤🤬
1 guy = HAVIER RAVEZ. 2 hot asian girls = MARLIN PIE KYOHEDI LEDR & CEROBLAST. 1 hot white girl = DEB. Sitting in the tree :P HAHAHAH! OOPS HAVIER RAVEZ strive indeed :P
Major Spoilers to HALLOWEEN ENDS: Michael Myers for the very first & also last time, finally speaks. He only says 1 word = LAURIE... Cause both Laurie & Michael die at the same time & at the end. Officer Hawkins & the grand daughter are alive. Michael dies by Laurie ripping him into pieces using a machine ripper.
Weeehhh
Please, dont waste your time watching this movie.This is the worst horror movie I warched in my whole life and I watched a lot of shitty movies but this is the worst by far . I don’t recommend this to anyone.#DONTWASTEYOURTIME!!!!!!
Venom,Halloween kills,black widow three delayed flops.
Absolute dog shit , makes a complete mockery of the classic!
Why didnt the town police come and kill him on last scene and why did the girl go to see michael myers sister in the house alone and she got killed instantly
MOST STUPID MOVIE OF THE YEAR! You destroyed the movie with that shit!
The lesson of the movie, evil reigns. Its a Curseween not Halloween 😂😆
This trailer is just so good I'm not a huge Michael fan I'm like Jason but great trailer 👍
1:50 so that’s how he survived the fire. he hid behind the door thing where the guns are. smart boy
lets be real a house that is on fire that much no firefighter is going inside, liked the attempt at the saw tho.
Trailers need to stop showing so God damn much.
Tf is this .. all of the characters in this movie is so dumb and cringe expect for the Boogie Man Mickey.
Who wants to see this but not old enough
Garbage just garbage
What the hell it's Michael mayers
Terrible acting 🎭
Bruh why didnt they just take away the knife so he cant kill them all and continue beat him up
does michael meyers hops on the bus to get to his destinations? i mean how does he gets from point a to b ? im sure he gets recognized if is strolling around at a turtle pace no?
i’m coming for you michael also stays in the hospital the whole time lmao
Such A Good Trailer
These have got to be the absolute dumbest civilians I’ve ever seen 😂 they make it so easy for Michael Meyers 😂
Im watching this today with a friend, feeling hyped!!
Slashstreet Boys still going strong, I see...
Yeah after watching it y’all no cap ruined Michaels escape you pretty much showed one of the most badass scenes in the whole movie at the beginning of the trailer like come on y’all could’ve at least cut out the saw death
Laurie didn't killed Michael with the fire, she just let him look cooler
This movie sucked.
They need to send the Terminator
Trash
Ok so, how many movies does it take to really terminate him ?
Film ga abis2
I was critical of the producers casting Nicole Kidman as Michael... But I was wrong.
im laughing at the end 🥲 guess he has more lives than 🐈
lol on the side it says halloween 2018
Halloween is still not over
I watched this movie yesterday, let me just say that the characters in this movie are dumb af. Yes I know it is movie, but the level of stupidity is annoying
micheal killing people were the only good parts, god this movie was garbage
Bahaha This is actually a really funny movie.
Stupid movie , that fker is unkillable 😑
This movie was FKN SICK! Masterpiece!
Don't watch it as a horror movie,  watch it as a comedy and you'll love it 😄🤣
داش مگه واقعه کربلااااس  ک اینم مث ابلفضل تخیلی بمیره 😂😂  کلش پنج لیتر خونه دیگه  صد تا گلوله خورد ده تا چاقو هنوز ،تو مونواکسید و دود و اتیش هم بود ولی زنده موند  واداااا فاااااااااک ابلفضل نسخه ی دوم😂😂💔
so scary
This movie was🔥🔥🔥🔥.
The most over reacted characters, stupid, cheesy, and wasted movie of all times. Halloween Producers indeed running out of ideas. Micheal indeed should have called "The Ironman" Bullets did not killed him. It is a joke movie. Never again Halloween kills for me.
Aren’t michael is old now too like jamie?!? Stop the cap michael
#1 Movie In America Baby 🇺🇸 🔪📽
This whole time they been thinking Michael Myers is a human. Bro is an indestructable force of nature that has no emotion. This man is a God or something. Shoulda sent him up to fight Thanos with the Avengers.
This is not a movie, this is rubbish making fun of viewers' minds
I thought that nurse was a bitch cuz she kept sending her husband to troubles ,in the end it turned out she is just stupid asf
That ritual really seems to have paid off for Michael
Worst movie..after the last halloween was pretty keen for this but had absolutely no story line no point to it and it looks as though there’s going to be another movie rehashing the same plot wouldn’t bother with it at all
Beware.
Scythe by Nate Setto brought m,e here 🎃👻
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GeFgVTqAJTA&t=1881s
The whole firefighter scenes were awesome
This movie is garbage.  The casting is terrible.  The acting is terrible.  The movie is a dumpster fire.
What a flop, what a waste of anticipation. What a waste of original 78' characters. Let's kill off Karen for effect. Let's make Michael Myers human by letting him walk around without a mask and making him look like an old man in a boiler suit. Let's kill Tommy Doyle and cast the worst actor ever for his role. Evil dies tonight. Yeah, it does. Fuck you Blumhouse.
I only saw the last 5 minutes cos I fell asleep but it was so cool
worst film ever
Movie was horrible I wanted to stab myself after wasting 90 minutes of my life 🎃👻
This movie was so horrible please don’t make no more. Y’all really should have left it back in the day😑
Ten people corner him, and you brought a board and a hockey stick?  No one brought their double barrels?  You deserve his beatdowns
0:10 :)
Trash
My biggest issue with this film: People splitting up randomly
1 Corinthians 15:1-4  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
And they always forget the rule of shoot/stab until you’re sure it’s dead 💀
Nobody is trying in this movie so frustrating
At this point Mike needs anger management... he need to get his AARP and sit down some where...don't he knows about forgiveness...he been killing  people since I was born... he needs to get save and baptized... that lady can't even go to the nursing home in peace... mike need to be there and get some of those medications...
and yet he sucks at dead by daylight
garbage
Insult to the audience's intelligence
Film was absolutely amazing! My favourite one by far!!❤️
I dunno what to say about this other than.. slow and jumbled. The film made NO SENSE, the story line was so complicated, it just bounced from scene to scene far too quickly without an explanation, well it had explanations but it wasn’t really explained well lol. And the main character who’s meant to be central is sat in the background all the way throughout😂😂. Another after lockdown film thats been RUSHED in order to force it out in time for October covid has ruined films!.. The film before was far better. And also why did no-one stab him in the head 🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
Spoilers!!!           See the reason I hate this movie the most is because they continuously hype up the fight between the Old Lady and Michael. There shouldn’t be another movie. Evil was supposed to die tonight. Plus it would probably be worse than this with no main characters left to kill off. Plus, I’d pay more to see a Michael Myers Drip movie 😂
I just finished watching this movie, it’s disappointing 😫
I LOVED this movie but this trailer gives away the whole movie.
I just watched it. I cant believe how people are in rage at the hospital for a one guy. The ending sucks!
37 gunshots, 69 stabwounds, 103 punches and infinite movies later, Laurie strode: Evil Dies Tonight Michael myers: oh yea,  bring it on baby!
This movie was awesome!
Why Allison think she so tough 😂😂 got me pissed off 😤
Noice.
msot kilsl an brutals mike mayers movie
I hope Laurie got him again
This was horrible!!!! The characters in this one could not be more stupid!!! I was pissed the entire runtime, I couldnt believe this was greenlight by producers,
Imagine trying to kill immortal serial killer with baseball bat. I guess it didn't end well
I will watch Halloween: Resurrection three times in a row, before I sit through this again.
This is comedy movie and I love it fuck you director!
If im on location i will cut the head with my knife. Hands and legs all cut. I dont fucking care if im sycho hahaha lol . How stupid caracter in this movie lol
Did anyone walk away from this movie asking themselves WHY? Very disappointed in this movie. The only good thing was Jamie Lee Curtis. Halloween 1, 2, and H2O told the story...they deviated with all others!!  Thank goodness this was FREE.
So, if one spouse of a homosexual couple dies, does that make the surviving spouse a widower, or a widow?
What is going on with this movie!!!! It's scary and it's October .... Nooooo
Looks amazing. Low key rooting for Michael with all those folks after him 🤷🏻‍♂️😂
this movie is soo great i watched in the cinema
I need to see this in cinema
I don’t understand why the trailer would show the kills…
Awesome movie I just saw it ,😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😳😳😳
Nobody:  Laurie: Doesn't kill Michael in the movie Me: Put me in coach
Do you need to watch Halloween 2018 to help you understand what is going on in this film?
I LOOOVE THIS ONE GREAT JOB !!!!
How Michael Myers will finally be killed once and for all will soon be on my website. And watch Holloween Kills for free.
Tell me the reason why Michael killed everbody ?
THIS GUY JUST DOESNT DIE DOES HE
Seeing this Saturday I hope Michael kills everyone cba with this bullshit anymore🤣
Fucking best kiddy movie I saw, Hollywood must close down and watch Bollywood movie.
Why is every Horror film women had to be the main hero?
Wow
Dont produce the next series of this shit, please. Movie sucks. People gather up and cant kill old piece of shit. I would kill him with one hand, for sure. I qm not saying make it 100% real life example, but it is hundred percent opposite. Indian movies are also lol
when i was watching the movie i thought he had the least killing spree on the series then at the end he killed everyone lmao.
with all do respect to the movie and all I know one thing for sure, who ever the f.ck you are doesn't matter you can take fire fighters down like that easy
2021 and we still have this kind of movie ? Very very nonsense ! 1 / 10
This movie so doesn't make sense ! Totally non sense ! Hahhahahhahahaha how come so many people around him, can't fight for them self, even michael on the ground. Non sense ! Stupid
Gak masuk akal masa sikopetnya kagak mati2 ditembak ditusuk digebukin.. Goblok
Baba
Not worth watching. Can't believe I was wasterd my time.  It's one of those films where they gathered lots or fans to be in the film or was made by fans.
They better bring John Wick next or we gon have Halloween movies till 2058.
The Fact That They Thought That Li Weak Ass Beating AT The End Was Gone Kill Micheal SMH Made Me Give This Movie A ZERO Out Of TEN (0/10)
For Halloween ends we don't want covid in it, we don't want woke shit in it, what we want is a Halloween movie. So don't fuck it up.
OK, next one will be Michael visiting Camp Crystal Lake and meeting Jason.
michael can never be killed... damn!
fucking hell. 19 kills in a trailer is probably a record already
If you watch the movie backwards, it explains that Michael is no different than the Wiccan idea of John Barleycorn and then the Scapegoat, Jack Pumpkinhead.
stupid movie🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
Dude I just finished watching it- he’s to strong 😭
I love movie so much
But still cant see his face MMMMOOOOMM NNNOOOO!! LMAO.
Dumb and boring don’t waste your money pure trash
I liked the first halloween but it's getting ridiculous this michael myers has supernatural powers,  from how and where did he get them I don't see that his sister has any? But what does it take it take for him to die beheading? Or would his head grow back again? 🤔
The climax is ultimate        Shit 😂😂.....even bullets can't kill him 😂😂??
Michael FINALLY DIES, as well as Laurie, a GREAT ENDING to the franchise!
How come NOBODY is stating the obvious?? This was a hit because NOBODY HAS PARAMOUNT+. If this was released simultaneously with Disney+😉or HBO MAX, it would’ve barely made 20 million opening weekend, 25m at best. Who’s with me?
Bruh, all the people in this movie are dumb as FUCK, they're all gansta and ready to take on Michael but then go off alone and get killed. Also no one can actually shoot a fucking gun from far away! Movie sucked!
where the fuck is the army at? or F.B.I or CIA... why are these amateurs hunting down a serial killer?
This movie literally had the dumbest characters of almost any horror movie I’ve ever watched lol. Sure let’s try to take someone out who came into his old house that you now occupy and even left a blood mark so you knew it was him that entered. No need to call the cops guys, we got this. Or the dad who clearly knows how powerful Mikey boy is, but still tells the kids with guns to wait in the car so he can go inside Micheal’s house alone and die lol. I give up on Hollywood.
Jamie Lee Curtis is old and for sure will gonna die, however Michael Myers won´t gonna die for many decades and this movie too
Galera, o halloween de 1978a 2009 é uma outra franquia… essa já é uma nova sequência que anula todas as outras anteriores, contando uma história 40 anos depois do halloween de 1978, que começa em 2018 e que provavelmente vai terminar até 2023 com o halloween ends.. então pra ter sentido, você tem que assistir o halloween de 1978, 2018, 2021 e o último que ainda vai ser lançado.. esses filmes são slashers
Now I get the last shot of the Trailer of Lorie walking is going to be the beginning of Halloween: Ends
I liked this movie but why bring back the original actors just to kill them off Lindsey is the only one that survived out of the 1978 characters besides laurie
My favorite killer
Seriously. Please let it die. It's stupid at this point.
I met him, 15 years ago; I was told there was nothing left; no reason, no conscience, no understanding in even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this... six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and... the blackest eyes - the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up, because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.
Stupidest movie I've ever seen just got done watching and I laughed all the way through at the Bad acting
Only Jason Voorhees can fight Michael Myers! An official Jason vs Michael movie, please? PLEASE?
This movie was such a disappointment
I'm glad I saw this movie first and this trailer second.  The trailer shows the whole movie
🎃🎃🎃🗡🗡🗡
This movie was actual trash. All the characters are brainless, it’s just Michael killing idiots for almost 2 hours. I expected so much more but you can tell it’s just a setup for another movie.
This movie was ass.
I like how he casually walks out of a fire
Was actually a really good movie
Wtf,, its so booooooooring 🥴🥴🥴
waste of time he kills everyone and he doesn't die
i liked the movie and am glad i didn't watch the trailer bc it revealed too much imo
is this movie woke free?
I will never stop rewatching this trailer just to get a chill.
One of my ideas is a movie where Michael actually dies but the movies series remains. Someone finds his mask and becomes crazy after putting it on. Like a curse and this becomes the next Michael
So stupid movie ! Not recommended at all !!
2 minutes!!!!!!
Wasn't a very good movie but I'm still glad it came out ...
L'attesa è finita, la leggenda continua ❤🎃
U know those movies that u watching on 1995 96 those where the cliche ...that is Halloween kills they didn't even bother them self to make a good one that belong to 2021 or a new gen :/
So no one gone speak about angel o Myers 😞
Does anyone know how to stream this in Canada?
spoilers: Evil don't die tonight
Error 404 -  brain not found !
no one talks about how mike's mask makes him look like Horatio from CSI
If he just wanna go home Leave him the fick alone .... It's easy ... Everyone move away from his home ...
no
Now Michael is a ghost...he also JUMPER can go everywhere..DAMN!!!
Be going to see this movie for the second time Sunday. And I can not wait to see it again!
Overrated hype lol
Why not just use the military?..??.
wtf did I just watch , worse than Riverdale
I didn't understand story but he kills when he sees people around him and he's like super hero never get hurt when got  stabbed and beat down by lot's of people like wolverine i guess
Guys it’s all in the name the great 4s Michael jackson Michael jordan Michael Pelphs and Michael myers of course he can kill everyone by just walking and having a kitchen knife 😂
Well after this I won’t be rushing to see “Halloween Ends” I don’t like the way the kill scenes were filmed considering it’s called “Halloween Kills”
A lot of idiots in then movie they executed jumping Michael horribly 💀
No, it was not that good, got boring and very silly, like the amount of people who had guns on then couldn't even shoot him once etc... I give it a 5.5/10
What i didn't like:  1. Too many idiots. It made us take the movie and characters as a joke. And made things predictable.  2. Should have been longer so it doesn't feel rushed, and feels more satisfying. And impactful.  3. The plot idea was a good idea imo, but could have been represented better. I get what the idea was but it was done badly.   What i DID LIKE:  1. The flashback scene  2. The references  3. The idea of the mob (again just executed badly)   4. James judes skills at acting Michael  5. The music
Oh come on. Michael again? I thought Michael was done with his last movie. You guys really want more of it? I don't get it.
What a lot of bullshit, no good plot, script or acting, after watching this movie you will become even more of an idiot than before, I didn't pay money to watch this movie and neither should you guys, its very bad, don't waste your money on this shit.
the music in this trailer is INSANE
In the bar when they announce the 2 patients that escaped, why don't they mention names? Usually what they do ain't it? They would've known it was Michael who escaped and that other guy.
No captions? It's 2021 c'mon!!! This video is not accessible for deaf and hard of hearing.
If she's not killing him this time, I'm stepping in
what's the point of having another movie where they did not add anything to the plot at all? They just killed off more main casts and made JLC look like not an A-list actress
Fun and pretty brutal movie. Can recommend, even though the first one was maybe better.
100% Micheal Side here 👇
That neck snap on the staircase was wicked
Masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This movie franchise needs to just go away. It's insultingly stupid and makes the world a little more dumb each time a remake or sequel is made.
Wtf.... The characters are so clumsy and dumb while the killer has some supernatural speed, endurance, luck and a lot of balls 😂 Felt like I'm watching a gore kid's show.. Gore anime are far more realistic than this🤣
Right,where do i watch this?
Just been to see this movie, it was shit. In a nutshell it just shows fire and medical staff being killed by Michael or attacked by the townsfolk for no reason, this goes on for 90% of the movie and then it seems that they forgot to plan an ending and just went for a cliche finale which was about as exciting as haemorrhoids.  2/10 wouldn’t recommend
This was the best one I think ..all the killing was crazy
The movie was so trash that inspire of being pirated, I still felt like they owed me money
TRASH MOVIE
Y'all can blame Danny McBride for the comedy/overkill parts. Hollywood is getting cheap, half-ass etc on these new films. Too much CGI being used in a lot of the new movies, poor movie making nowadays. This isn't the first horror film they made half-assed. These last two Halloween films went downhill for me and they ruined the theme song in this one but I'll still watch them during the Halloween season. The first Halloween directed by Rob Zombie ranks number one in my book although the classic Halloweens are still good.
Whoever kills Michael becomes the next Michael Myers
You know when you see Universal you know its gona be a good movie? That's me when I see BlumHouse Productions in the movie I know its gona be a banging horror movie
Please delete this movie, before its to late. This is the worst movie in halloween series. I dont know from when michael myers is jackie chan and can fight 20 people from once...
That's just lazy writing
Damn Michael must have bullet repellent on because nobody cannot shoot and 🎯 hit this guy, Or the guns are payed actors, But man they beat the breaks off Poor Mikey😂😂😂
Amazing
Worst movie ever!!!!!
people are starting a petition to get rid firefighter scene. As a human I think it’s offensive to have other humans killed in this movie and we should take all those scenes out as well. Why would a psychopath killer kill people in a horror film?
Michael was the only one in the movie following Covid rules. If Big John and Lil John had worn masks, they'd still be alive.
I've gotta chuck in my five cents. I thought this movie was terrible. Literally no plot. Go around and kill. Borrrrring.
Might as well continue .. HALLOWEEN: BOOGEYMAN LIVES  HALLOWEEN : THE CURSE   plenty more titles y’all could do before  HALLOWEEN ENDS
Why weren't the cops called to the fire as well? They were in the old Carpenter films!! If they showed up on scene with those firemen, then maybe they would have been saved. But, old Mikey would have just escaped from the morgue again.... 😆😨😲
Halloween has gone from suspense thriller to horror throughout it's evolution. I sometimes think the original is where the should've stopped.
I watched it today. It’s not bad. It had good action with the kills, amazing entertaining scenes. Not the best Halloween movie ever but still not bad. The ending was sad and made me emotional. I’m excited for the next one
Saw this 3 days ago and fuck bro how can y’all jump him and still get fucked and also how tf y’all run slower than him 💀💀💀
Just saw this and it was terrible. All the people and victims were stupid beyond belief. Such a waste.
this.. is "Hollywood" ....... lmfao!!!!!!!!!
YOU   CAN'T    KILL     EVIL  !!
A lot of people saying this was a terrible movie if this movie is terrible please tell me what horror movie out there is fantastic I will watch it
Also if you have Michael's mask you might as well take the nastiest shit in it. Yeah he'll kill you but did he really win after he puts it on? You decide
So I guess multiple armed police officers don't accompany fire fighters to fires in this universe. I'd love to see him pull that crap with 20 9mm pointed at his 6ft 6 sasquatch ass
Great trailer, average movie, terrible ending
I’m so disappointed in this movie-
They did that psych patient dirty. He was really depending on Laurie’s daughter to help him and then…………… 🥲
This guy Michael gives full meaning to the word April fools for every death scene from any of his movies 1978 I’m dead April fools 2021 I’m dead April fools
Great movie, just got back from watching it tonight. Didn’t really like how it ended though.
We will stop him tonight       Meanwhile him teleporting
I'll have to wait for the 3rd movie...
Movie was bad
if Michael Myers can chase the same girl for 43 years so can I
GREAT mOVIE
I will always root for michael no matter what .
THEY SHOWED HIM ON FIRE IN THE LAST MOVIE  this is bullshit
I don’t get like what did the fire have to do with anything I’m probably just really stupid
I saw the movie totally suck I laughed the whole entire time sucks
Worst film i ever seen.
Seriously the whole city can’t kill a man The writer thought watchers are stupid, the level of the movie was -0
Nothing is wrong with this movie People just love to hate on anything
Se alguém souber oque ghost b.c tem haver com esse filme agradeço
Super dissapointed.
People don't know anything about good movies these days And apparently cringe is the only word that these kids have in their brains because it's the only word they used
I cringed twice , first  with the actors confidence second the acting
This movie was terrible.
Seriously these movies with Michael Mayers suck why he even still alive?he's human it's not a supernatural creature
I saw this movie I love it I'm going to watch it again when I get off work.
I guess the scene where she’s walking down the hallways with the knife will be in the next one
Poor fire fighters 😔
This town is the most Governed by their city/state and Country that they don’t have AR 15’s or AK’s.  Micheal Mires scared me as a kid but now it’s simply STUPID.
Just finished the movie. I’m glad I didn’t pay to see in cinema 🤣 Michael is MVP here. People in that town don’t deserve to live 🤣 I mean its just a movie but for the first time I feel like I’m happily seeing them all dead
All of these comments shows they people don't have any taste and don't know anything about good horror movies
just watched this movie, damn its not even horror, its more like a comedy with the amount of stupidity going on.
1:33 sliver Shemrock masks
Every new movie gets worse and worse, these don’t come close to comparing to the real Halloween movies
Jus watched.. 🇮🇳 Now this psychopath movie jus turning into cringe movie.. Combining old halloween 🎃 movies are great but continuing the same 🎃 are not so cool !! Even 007 had an end 😀
Does everyone suppose to be thick as fuck in this movie 🤣 like really
Terrible movie.
That scene where michael kicks the car door and makes the girl kill herself was dope af
NO ! Hollywood kills. With stupidity.
The acting was terrible, the whole movie sucked
I lost my mind how stupid these characters were. One bullet to the head and every thing would have been over 🤦
halloween movie terburuk dibanding sebelum-sebelumnya..... so sad
Can someone watch this fresh without the original?
Horrible movie!! Who was the director, the fast and furious director!
All of a sudden Michael don't look that crazy at all with the mask on. #corona
Michael myers as brutal as hit gets in this movie love it
I am going to see the 7:05PM showing of this movie called Halloween Kills Today because I Like Horror Movies a lot and Stuff Like That and I Like Halloween Movies and I Like Michael Myers a lot in 2021 and Stuff Like That I am Jamie Norwood
🗑🗑😩
https://youtu.be/95rNxT_RgAs 🥺
This movie is total garage.  I wanted to watch it and now I wish I had the 2 hours back.  Jamie Lee Curtis didn't even try.
I think that when Michael Myers finally does go down, it should be at the hands of Austin powers.
https://youtu.be/GkxNrzaJjXo
I wanted to like this movie so bad  but it felt lackluster... For one, JLC was hardly in the movie, second there was no showdown with Michael and JLC, there was no goOd theme intro, and the ending was bland. The story was pretty much the town mob going after the wrong guy that was also at the mental institution ...also, the mob was able to corner Michael at the end but he killed like 10 people at the same time so easily ok...  Also, spoiler alert!!!! Don't read any further  if if u hate spoilers.. the daughter played by Judy Greer dies at the end....She was integral I think for this trilogy....  Thank god I just watched this on peacock and didn't spend loads of money at the theatres..waited for 3 years for this movie to come out and blah...wasn't even good  So this Kills sequel is setting up for a big showdown for Halloween Ends I guess.. JLC will get her revenge for the death of her daughter in Halloween Ends so I'm sure Ends will be a much better movie
Shit movie
This movie is awful .
WE NEED Danielle Harris IN HALLOWEEN ENDS
Not gonna lie... After rewatching the original movie and the 2018 one. I kinda appreciate this movie a lot.  There's a lot of tie ins, references and call backs to the OG.  Like the old Nurse from the OG, the car scene she had in this movie was extremely reminiscent of her first encounter with him. I love that kinda shit.  Also, having Lindsey, Tommy and Lonnie - a kid who only had like 1 or two scenes in the OG being brought back. Felt cool to see.  Focusing on these characters made the world of Halloween seem bigger and imo it was kinda cool seeing the effect Micheal had on the town and the characters who did survive. I genuinely enjoyed seeing Tommy, Lindsey and Lonnie doing shit.  Highly reccommend seeing the OG before this movie. It really adds to it imo
someone didnt get there candy
Don’t ever make another Halloween movie. THIS MOVIE SUCKS BADLY!  AND WHEN I SAY BAD I MEANT REALLY BAD! The story BAD The acting CRINGING BAD The Characters BAD The cut scenes BAD the ending (you guessed it) BAD  And Jamie Lee Curtis looks like Bruce Willis with a grey wig on!
Your virtue signaling is pretty obvious. Just end the franchise. You're disgusting for using this movie to condemn Jan 6th. Unbelievable.
Don't waste your money the movie was not scary at all little kids seen it and went right to bed there's no music no gotcha moments movie actually sucked
Impressed Michael killed every tax-paying citizen and tax-receiving organization in this one.
This film is getting predictable it must be at least the tenth film   with Myers in. Can't film makers create some thing original ? I'm sure if they put Myers threw a mincer and made spaghetti Bolognese with it Myers would be back.
This movie so trash
That old women can not fight Michel
I mean is Michael blind? How did he learn to drive? I thought Michael sparred kids. Why did he kill that boy in Halloween 2018? What inside his flesh that makes him near immortal?
Micheal killed 5 people 40 years ago. Woooo. They should of just rebooted the whole thing and started from the beginning.
It was..a sequel. Underwhelming. No stalking prey in this one but more kill bill body counts. Plus broke a sacred rule don't remove the mask. Reminds you his ass is a dinosaur. Least at end we see a karen get taken down haaa
This. Was. Terrible. We almost got up and left......
THIS MOVIE WAS ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!!! Saw it on peacock
michael myers the best..who is jason !
Its shit, like the rest
Im sure it'll be a good movie and I cant wait to watch it.  Except digital makes it look like some random YouTuber's movie or behind the scenes footage, its so clean looking. Film is superior looking, although it can be trash if the camera person and cinematographer suck and if the story sucks.  Digital is like, everything can be perfect, the film can be massive hit, but it will miss the real look, the dreaminess and immersive impact that film has, because digital looks realistic and documentary like
This is worst series halloween movie...this director must be fired
WE need Jason Voorhess
Stupid movie .. stupid ending my gosh!
Just call John wick!!!! Apparently he’s the guy who u call to catch the f***** boogey man
Time to call jhon wick
There is no way he is human..
This movie was so disappointing. Bringing in pointless characters when they should have focused on Lourie and her family. All to please the PC crowd. The constant flashbacks etc was stupid, and why have they turned Michael into the Terminator? The original Halloween movie is a classic, the rest after that is best forgotten.
goddamit enough spoilers in this?>???>>???? Ugh had to turn it off.
Wtf? Can you just stab the guy on his head? What a amateurs. Bunch of noobs.
EVIL Dies Tonight! Michael: No fuckers, You all die tonight (HA    HA     HA)
The stupidity of the characters nearly killed me 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
There's no tension, no stakes-- just mindless violence, but if you're into that, have fun 👍🏾
What a disappointing movie, for one we have become victims to watching every movie with at least one gay couple in it, for the the politically correct people, then we have to throw 50 black people in the movie so we don’t look racist. The movie just fails to deliver its boring and dull !
Honestly, it was awful. I was so excited for this movie, but it was so all over the place. I feel like I should’ve felt sadder over certain characters deaths but the movie never gave us a chance to become attached. It’s 2 hours of introducing new characters and random war cries of “evil dies tonight!”. I hate how they’ve created Michael to be some supernatural immortal boogeyman who’s indestructible and have ruined the one thing that made him scary in the first place, the fact that he’s just a psychopathic killer and represents ultimate darkness of the human psyche. Not to mention Jamie lee Curtis MAY have gotten 10 minutes of screen time, if that. Just meh
i cant bellive hes not dead
Watched this movie last night. I am both disappointed and elated. So much of it was predictable and laughable like when the two gay guys go upstairs to investigate who broke into the house, and one of the guys takes a tiny kitchen knife with him. I mean wtf!  I cannot believe Laurie Strode stays in Hospital throughout the entire movie!! That was a bit ridiculous. I also cannot believe I have to wait another year to see her fight Michael. I hope they make it as terrifying as when she fought with him in H20.
Dumb idiotic movie. Waste of your time
I've seen it and it's very good. A HUGE kill count, probably more than any other in the series. And yes his mask is removed, but it's done discreetly so as to grab your attention without ruining the mystique of the character.
Maybe next they should try to cling to him some tax evasion. Game over.
Thanos even said..you should go to the head..but still...
Is it safe to say ther is no Michael there never was. He was always a demon.
Question? Did anyone else notice micahael face turn I to something at the end when he was looking out the window?
this movie was so bad..... you're better off watching the orginals.
BRUHH
Anybody Else Laugh During The Little John And Big John Scene? Lol. And The Way Michael Mcdonald Dressed From Mad Tv
was expecting something more :(
Another version of Jason Friday 13th
This trailer is the whole movie basically.
Happy birthday Michael Myers 😂
Terrible movie, horrible acting. What a waste of time lmao.
Michael Myers is Immortal
THIS IS 1 IS THE WORSE THRILLER OR HORROR MOVIES. I was so Disappointed 😞 🤦🏽‍♀️
So he did like teleport at the end or wtf was that... Whole movie was great until the last 30 seconds... The 3rd movie should have started with him standing in the street
The Cult from Halloween 3 had those Automaton, Michael is basically that but since he's not made of cogs and bolts in a skin suit but organs he can regenerate
I just KNOW my good sis Laurie is tired 😭 fighting for her life EVERY Halloween
Not good, don’t waste your money on this. Go watch reruns of the originals 👍🏼👍🏼
Michael Meyers been mad since 1960 something killed his first sister gets locked up as a lil boy turns 21 in 1978 breaks out Halloween day somehow knows how to drive...anyway dude been pissed since 1978 get this guy a woman for crying out loud he needs to release !!!!
Man what this like part 100?
This is the best Halloween movie yet
Mike: thats a dub lads
This was terrible 😐
At this point Michael Myers is Jason Vorhees, not trying to spoil the movie, just watch the movie and come back to this comment and tell me I'm right. 🤔 He's supposed to be a HUMAN, a regular guy! Unlike jason who's a zombie and has supernatural warping powers.🤦‍♂️
I foresee its present 6.1 imdb rating dropping even more.  5ish maybe.  So much wrong with it.  Would make a good drinking game everytime they say Evil Dies Tonite.  The only good things what the soundtrack.  Hunters Moon by Ghost !!  Awesome band and huge choice :)  Yah Ghost !!
I loved this movie. So much 💩 these days and for a longtime i enjoyed being in the movies and watching it. Loved Halloween movies since youngster and this wasnt a disappointment! ❤👌🏼 The 1st one i did not like that much, it was good but this one was so much better! 👌🏼 I hope they keep the old music too, no techno or newage 💩. Oldies rock and they give u chill 👌🏼😅
None of them have understood the assignment since 1978. Chop him up into pieces. Bury them across the country. This dragged on for too long now. It’s only a movie but it’s bloody good if I’m this bothered.
So if he never runs and just walks fast then can’t they just outrun him and drive away?
Should be called “Halloween Sucks”.  Dramatic and silly dialogue.  “Evil dies tonight”  <eyes roll>  Anthony Michael Hall?!?!  There was so much philosophical dialogue.  This is easily going to be one of the worst Halloween movies.  I wonder why Jamie Lee Curtis did this.
Movie was terrible, they really needed to stop making this movie. We understand that you cannot kill Michael Myers, but the fact that all these blows he takes in the movies is getting annoying, apparently nobody in 1978-2021 cannot aim.  A clean headshots kills just about anything and anyone, but they apparently haven't tested that.
As a horror fan this movie could’ve done better, watched it last night and I’m kind of disappointed but good gory killing scenes
Yes Sir!,....   The cow that keeps milking.   .....   Milk this cow forever!
As a big Halloween fan like myself I was let down by this film I expected so much more out of this and all I got in return was nothing I can’t believe I wasted my money yesterday to see this movie
Myers vs the avengers next
The original Halloween movie is a classic. This is another woke movie with the intent to push an agenda. Pointless characters brought in its getting old Hollywood.
*Good luck, Mike.~*
So stupid film😕
This was the worst Halloween movie yet.
Michael is not scared of anyone, the only thing he worries the most is covid19
Horrible película ..,.
This movie is absolutely hot garbage! Jamie Lee Curtis is only in the movie for thirty minutes screaming and stealing hospital drugs. 😒  Michael Myers is mistaken for a lil penguin man dude that escaped when he escaped. This was a highly unnecessary part of the film....which ends in an awkward suicide...felt like they were tryna evoke summ kinda sad emotion outta ya...but I ain't come there to be sad bruh. It wasn't sad at all, it just didn't make sense!! 😐  Mike ends up Killin the whole neighborhood with a butcher knife at the end. It was great. NOT! LET THIS MF DIE! I NEED MY REFUND! RIGHT NWEOOWW MANE!!🤬  This is a clown ass production 🤡
EVIL DIES TONIGHT!!
It should have been called Halloween Sucks , This movie really sucks and the acting is crap
This movie wasn’t so good
What a waste of movie
was decent up until the inevitable gay shit, so i quit watching
was decent up until the inevitable gay shit, so i quit watching.
This movie was garbage.
I give this movie a 3 of 10.
Why is this exactly like Terminator?
Didnt know Michael was a secret ninja, absolutely ruined the end 😂
Bro it would be good if they had the others scary characters like Jahson candy man all of them😭😭😭
Very gooooooooood
Play stupid game win stupid prize 😂it is so fake 😂they always move slow and always went alone😂😂😂
Why are they calling him the boogeyman like y’all just making the movies more and more fake like all the old movies were masterpieces but now y’all just make shit stupid lol like cmon
I saw Halloween Kills, ova weekend, by far the best Halloween, but studio listen, when he had the mask off y’all should have let us see his face and shit, we know he’s better with mask, but keep us connected by knowing what he really looks like underneath
terrible acting
This is stupid movie.,
this was horrible. wow
I like Halloween movies but this one was meh.....
EvIl DiEs ToNiGhT!!1!
Please release this cello cover/version of the theme so I can buy it. Thx.
Worst movie I’ve ever seen
Absolute trash. Your better off burning your 💰
i wanna Watch it Again 😂
Mmmm buscaba uñun comentario en español para ver qué tal la peli jajaj
I dont understand how cops and pp keep shot him and miss him or wait at last min he start walking away wtf
Just watched the movie yesterday and i can say it is the most shit halloween movie ever
They would've fuckin ended it here🤐
It’s suck movie ever!!! There’s nothing good happy ending!! What the purpose for this movie?? SHIT
Was supposed to be comedy right? Well done with the trailer though. Im not even talking for the actors, kids will act better...
The producer so f***** up to review again!! Im waiting for so long but end up so much hated!!
This shit was boring af..I literally fell asleep
1:38 to 2:04 I'm a big horror fan, but that gave me goosebumps! Taking a different approach to the Halloween series by adding more action scenes can really make an already great series better!
I loved this movie!!! Great cliffhanger at the end that will make anyone excited for "Halloween Ends" in 2022!!
Hands down one of the best holloween movies ever💯
Yes...
It was such a great movie 👌
It's good to see my all time favorite horror movie still Casting but yeah it's more for the money and new comers/money .. for one the story lined fk'd! and this new stuff entirely too rushed but since I have no control thanks fa putting my boy back on the big screen💯 fk it
Im a True Halloween fan since Jamie Lee Curtis in the first Halloween. This absolutely SuXxs!! This is TRASH... What happened to the stalking, slow walking, Suspense, Heart Racing Halloween? I was anticipating this one for so long and BLUMHOUSE fucked it up for me. Come one John Carpenter..... SMH! TF...
One of the worst films I've ever seen
Soooo.... Michael Myers is Superman??? Dumb dude, just dumb, dude. Lazy writing, no effort at all.
They took it to a whole different genre. It didn't feel like the Halloween franchise at all. There was too much political commentary sprinkled throughout. The whole hospital chase was a reference to Jan 6. The monologue at the end talked about what divides us and the evil in us. And they definitely crossed that grey area as to whether or not he is the boogey man or not. The violence was over the top, even for a horror movie. I don't care for it.
WHAT THE HECK IS THIS MOVIE! It's does not makes sense anything at all! I mean it's just 1 man and it's impossible for him to kill? How many would it take to kill him like Billion all of us?! This series has to end, it just keeps going around the story over and over again. Please make this Halloween movie end!  It's just another classic slasher movie with nonsense with bad script! I'm glad i didn't watch this movie at theaters as my instincts are real, it will never end. 3/10! 👎🏼
after watching this movie is should be call halloween evil dies tonight
Lets go Brandon!
Looks like $hit
i think it's enough for him so Bad movie
can’t wait to wait to watch this !! 😭
i've watched it and all I can say that this film has no logic. period.
Defenitely this is Hollywood/USA movie
Or maybe the peoples enjoys seeing victims been killed brutally. That's what this movie want to express?? I don't know.. just hate to see n feels how unless these polices are and how helpless those peoples who needs help.
Sigh! Sad to say.. to the outside world.. it saw how weak the peoples are. Only 1 n not ghost type of killer. Isnt it better to chop both hands and legs off and bring to the lab for further experiments.. hahaha
Wtf does he ever die ?
So, this kind looks like a Kruger remake... starts off with a fire, he "dies" and now the town I getting murdered.
I hacked the system so I can watch the movie for free
This is useless, you want to tell me that no one can cut off his damn head? No kind of immortality can live through that. Bullshit, i aint play like that i swr
no matter how fast you run, Michael walks and strolls faster
Dope movie, but shitty characters. (I’d honestly like to see Micheal kill the whole haddonfield.)
Can't understand some of the hate for this film, it's what most of us wanted, to see Michael Myers really let loose, the argument with there isn't really a plot is idiotic, Michael is killing all over the town causing panic, its supposed to be chaos. Brilliant movie if you understand it
can i watch this if i haven’t watched the first movie?
This movie truly sucked. Felt stupid watching this... to say characters in this movie have the brain cells of an ostrich would be an insult on the ostrich.
There's a reason Michael Myers can't die. Hollywood is trying to show you that a super human robot will be accidentally released into towns to emerge on a killing spree. You don't expect a walking demon appearing as a human being to succumb to death by mortals. Transhumanoids are coming. Wake Up
WERE TF IS THE SON ! You know the real fans want to know !!
boring movie ever😑
Rating 1-10, i give a 0, very disapointed , no storyline at all , horrible movie
The acting was fucking atrocious what a big disappointment the best thing about this movie was when it was actually completely finished blumhouse need to stop wit the shit there turning out
👌👌👌💪
Laurie didn’t even get a chance to kill Michael she was in the hospital throughout the entire movie
Halloween kills? No! Stupidity will kill you.
After watching this movie it automatically became the worst movie ever! Wtf was they thinking?
holy shit how did they go from the first movie to this heap on piling garbage. Imagine the gas from the cabin in the woods is the oxygen in this movie. Lazy writing and infuriating logic.
They attempted to kill him. Also, he stomped a man’s head into literal pieces
Damn Michael can survive a fire even tho he is old
I was so excited for this movie and it was trashhhhh
Need tamil dubbed
The masks from halloween 3 are a nice touch. even though i can't name a single person who liked that movie.
Laurie: I’m coming for you, Michael Also Laurie: *Stays in the hospital*
This movie is horribleeeee, don’t but don’t waste your time with it. Jesus why?
THIS IS THE KORNIEST HOLLOWEEN EVER 😒
Garbage…. This film was straight garbage 🗑 lol 0/10
iF THEY KILL MICHEAL, WE ARE COMING FOR HOLLYWOOD.
I’m surprised he wasn’t offed and replaced by an alphabit thing lol

He did a nuke in less than 1 min
I went and seen this movie to night one of the strongest in the series I put it right there with Rob zombie 2007 remake as a close 2nd I wasn't feeling some of the characters coming back like Tommy Lonnie Lindsey or the facts they ignore  the events of Halloween 2 other than that A-
Awesome movie!!
NOT impressed. In the least. At all. It's corny Af. But thought, "Ehh, mehh, hey, why not"?...Nothing else to do.
That ending was gay bro this shoulda been the last one
Worst movie ever!
Can't wait to see the first and one last time in theaters on 31th
"CHE-CHE-CHE, HA-HA-HA-HA....KILL-KILL-KILL...."  Thus, Micheal heard the weird noises and then turns around to see an big body-type, ragged-clothed wearing, heavy breathing, worn and torn hockey-nask wearing, creepy figure., with a machete........to be continued....!!!
This was not terrible but it wasn't good either..praying the 22 release will be all we ever needed
Worst Halloween movie so far
Idc what anyone says but the movie wasn’t bad as you think lol just chill out. And yet I can’t wait for the final Halloween
this movie sucked, worst one they ever did. don’t get your hopes high at all
"We can't stop him!!!"  "Micheal Myers is on the move, again....!"   Then a man name Cage walks in.......shit now really got real.....!
What a shityy movie lol
Everyone was an NPC in this movie...
Pathetic movie.... what a waste of time
Just watched it. Enjoyed!!
When an entire hospital gets a man to commit suicide.
Absolute mindless garbage. Dumb plot...dumb dialogue...horrible acting...Michael had the best lines in the movie, because he doesn't speak.
Everyone saying that the people are dumb. They are correct but… think about this: - Everyone Is tired of everyone dying because of michael and they want to see him laying on the ground like all of his victims. And seeing him “dead” on the ground is enough to make them happy. When the officer will shoot his head for the final blow he stands and kills everyone. They have been killed not because of stupidity but because of *Happiness, Relief, and Being confident* they see him drop on the ground getting smash on the back and being stab by a knife on the back as well (quite near the neck but still) and previously being stabbed at the back by a huge pitchfork. (That is enough to make him bleed so bad) But they do not know that for me. His mask are  where his immortality comes from (from any halloween fans here who watched all halloween movies, it is the mast who makes him immortal?). The residents need to change for a time for the battle against michael. Murder him completely!
Halloween Is of one Slasher favorites. Michaels Myers Is one of my favorite killers Jamie Lee Curtis is one of The Final Girls favorites!...🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃
One of the worst films the world had ever seen. What an enormous disappointment.
I love the Halloween movies but I hope in the last movie 2022 , someone actually gets smart and cuts his head off, no coming back from that 😂
Saw this movie recently & it sucked, boring extremely repetitive, I love the franchise & I thought it was dogshit, it had great gore but that's literally it, it's my opinion, people were walking out before the end, I stayed til the end but it was lame, same repetitive speeches over and over again with gore in-between
Just when I thought uncle Michael was dead, he showed me he's tougher than I thought!
Garbage!! The producer is a complete moron. This shit is a rerun times a million. Come on do something new for ducks sake!!! One I can’t even finish this movie it’s so cliche!!!!!
If only I had watched this trailer first...its basically the whole movie in less than 3 minutes and way much more watchable
David Gordon Green will next year become the only person to have directed more than 2 Halloween movies with Rick Rosental and Rob Zombie having directed 2 each. He's promised a "Twist" to "Halloween Ends" All I can say is, whatever it is, please don't give "The shape" any dialogue!
The Scooby Doo and crew would be on  next movie.
There is no way in hell this movie is any good with that old hag Curtis in it.
Michael owned every scene he was in and the movie was shot beautifully highly recommend
Good movie
Halloween Kills *In Space* when?
(Spoilers) I think it’s the mask that makes him immortal, because when he reaches for his mask he can take Down a whole town. Plus when the psychiatrist puts on his mask he gets crazy. P.S don’t bring a bat to kill Michael fu*king Myers
If this movie was labeled as comedy maybe I would’ve liked it
This movie was wild
Halloween still my fav horror film this one was excellent like the last one they know what Halloween fans want A+
This is an Avengers level threat!!!
I think this movie was better than the 2018 Halloween due to the lack of gore,  this new halloween was like watching michael michael myers at a mortal kombat game doing a finish move .🔥
The ending wasn’t as good as Halloween 2018. That mob shit can go. & I wish we had more scenes of Lindsey. Even interactions between Laurie & Lindsey together after all these years. Other than that everything was iconic especially the score & flashbacks. Overall Halloween kills 8/10.
this movie was okay.....
I just watched this movie last night and it was soo good
Garbage.
This movie was not good to me honestly I watched it twice ...I think this should be there last.
Now you don’t have to watch the movie lol .
Every character in this movie is an idiot. They all deserved to die for being so dumb. I don't even think I'll watch the next one. So bad.
1/10. Stupid characters, terrible plot, poor remake. Don’t waste your money.
Definitely not as good as the 2018 one. Had many scenes and characters that made no sense.. everyone shot worse than storm troopers.. the only interesting and smart character was Michael Myers. Jamie didn’t even have an encounter with him at all. Only good parts of movie was when it went back in time with Hawkins
The kill scenes were good but I didn't understand the story.
Omg 😳 this movie was so bad. Feels like a copy of the original. Made me go back and watch Rob Zombies 🧟‍♂️ Halloween 🎃 so as to salvage that Halloween movie experience.
Every Year- Universal Pictures: "Hey its getting closer to Halloween. What horror movie should we make to celebrate it?" Writer: "Ooo..., I know! How about we make another Michael Myers movie?" Producer: ..... Executive Producer: .... Director: .... Universal Pictures CEO: "...mmmmm....yeah, why not"
100% absolutely shit . Acting terrible. Story line terrible .abomination
Absolutely terrible movie.. Dead dissapointing
did i just see theo 😍 i can’t wait to watch this
Me and my boyfriend and his mom qhen and seen this yesterday AND OMG this is an amazing movie but there is a lot of blood  so if you don't like blood and people getting stabed to death then I would not watch this this movie is a 10 out of 10
Next time you should show all the kills in the trailer, you know to kill even the slightest bit of suspense
Whoever liked this movie ate paint chips when little. This movie suck major balls!!  Horrible acting and writing. At the end i was rooting for Michael.
Stupid movie with whole bunch of idiot characters.  Such a waste of time ughhh!!!
Love that they threw in a Season of the Witch easter egg in there.
Even if he was made of steel, he wouldn't have survived it. So unrealistic.
Has to be the dumbest Halloween I have seen so far halfway thru it I stopped paying attention .. please stop with the sequels they keep making them straight trash..
Good fuck i'm watching this alone tonight with flour on my face. #soexcited
To whoever is reading this Jesus is coming soon repent and turn away from your sins before its too late
The original Halloween was the first horror movie I saw. I was eight years old, and fell in love with horror movies ever since. To this day, Michael Myers is my favorite movie serial killer. I loved the ending of this movie, and I hope they never kill off Michael.
People in this movie need aim assist
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!! we’ve been waiting months for this Halloween to come out we streamed it Friday on Peacock it was freaking horrible probably one of the worst Halloween’s ever made it sucked.
Worst one ever made sorry the worst how u go from the one before this being good to shit that fast who ever thought of this one destroy it mf was straight garbage
Stupidest movie ever made
La resolución de la película lastima la vista, nada recomendable
Está bien pinche fea la película, no me gustó, dura un chingo y para lo mismo, hasta me heché a roncar 😕
I’m gonna watch it today in the theater
I thought the movie was good, some strong scenes I liked the cinematography, the directing 3.5/5 for me.
HOLY SHIT........He's Back.....................!!
Most stupid movie ever 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
2:25 wasent even in the movie
Fuck this looks good
watched this, it was not bad, I hate the title though
Lol
Don’t waste your money going to see this. Wait until it’s free in cable. Almost fell asleep during the movie.
Reeeeee! Let it burn! reeeeeee!
we need Michael vs Jason
is jason vorhees in this
Worst movie. How the F a man is immortal and keep on killing people with his knife. While others holding guns are getting killed by him. Utter nonsense. Please don't waste time on this shit.
Please,  don't waste 2 hours of your life....
YESSSS IM SO HYPED
If you’ve ever seen horror movie don’t bother watching this.. you’ve already seen everything that happens in this.
I enjoyed the movie , I’m a big Micheal fan ... but in my opinion Rob Zombie would of made this film a lot better
Nice,very,very very very nice ,Michael is still alive ,evil won!!!.Good movie.
I'm very very sorry for saying this. But this movie is so dumb. Sorry...
I wonder whether Jamie Lee Curtis has set some kind of record for playing the same character over the most amount of actual years passing.
Same garbage as always
I know he’s “invincible” or some shit now but they had his ass dead to rights on multiple occasions
Poor Laurie has wasted her whole live preparing for Michael to come after her again and it turns out , he’s not even interested in her 😅😅
Not that good I seen it free online on a app a lil bit funny
The whole town is cursed with stupidity. Police who cant shoot. Hospital staffs with brains of a donkey. Lil/big John puts away a golf club over a butter knife. Even Laurie's grandaughter is an idiot. 1/5 star.
I WATCHED THIS YESTERDAY SND IMA WATCH IT AGAIN NOW
Yh mate I got shot & stabbed up bare times battered with bats and left to burn in a fire but still alive hahahaha WANKKKK
Just came back to say the wait was worth it🎃
After decades of Michael Myers killing movies he is ones more in action and as usual for no reason at all. The first versions was scary in its own way but these days its sadly more a joke than frightening. Please dont come around any more Michael because people have started laughing instead. Bye.
Watching this today wish me luck I’m not good at all with horror movies or haunted houses I’m watching it in theaters
just know that the sequel will not end until the main character/ the old lady/ dies in real life. Just  sayin.
They should make a movie Michael Myers Vs. Jason Voorhees
Worst movie in years I honestly felt like I waisted my money and ppl suck
Bro how tf did they all get him pinned  down and still lose , he got stabbed, shot, hit, and dude got up like it was nothing, people in movies never go for the head, they had a chance to cut his head off or blast his brains out with a gun, but no they fr said “let’s go for the body :D” overall 6/10
i watched this and i feel stupid.
This movie sucks balls real big balls they need to pay me just for watching this bs
🎉🎉🎉🎉 yassss can’t wait too see it
I was rooting for Michael, just like the last film!!
I've huge expectation about this sequel but they really give us SHIT Halloween movie ever made😂
This movie was shockingly terrible
they actually have a iq of a goldfish, micheal’s immortal and they’re hunting him down to kill him
The worst edition ever
Oh damn, michael is a super human
trailer was better
myers: covid got nothin' on me. my mask has withstood the test of time.  legend says jason finally died from covid cos his mask has holes on it.
They could have nuked the house and the mf would still be alive
Can anyone tell me what is the genre of this style of recording with the cuts of scene and zoom in the guns with that filter at the beginning of the film, kind of an "exaggerated" recording?
Hear me out the Halloween series is great but I feel like it’s getting boring the same thing happens every movie I honestly didn’t like this movie and I think they could have done better
peoples in these movie really don't know how to shoot huh? it's either that or don't have the ammo..so lame
Jason is a Halloween Legend.
DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. Stupidest movie ever. No conclusion what so ever in the end. Jamie Lee Curtis doesn't even face Michael in the movie. She is in the hospital the entire time. The build up lead only to a dissapointing end. They don't kill Micheal he kills them. I'm done with the Halloween franchise.
This movie was so bad, acting terrible, wasent even filmed like a Halloween movie should be, hardly any jump scares, best part for me was the last 5 minutes, each to their own but just felt so let down by this movie  to what it should of been. And what the hell was that music all about when he killed the young lad at top of the stairs and then walked down stairs, shocking !!!!
The movie was bad. They could have done something with it, but there little twist with this one was a big group that all hates Michael. It hurts to see them say evil dies tonight (ignoring that just 2 hours ago they were saying the same thing) its almost like they completely forgot the last movie. And if I remember correctly, wasn't the house abandoned in the last movie? Now there is a forced gay couple in there. There are people that add nothing to the plot that are just there. The plot was really messy, it seemed like Michael had no real motive, he was just wandering around. And usually what makes the halloween movies good is when Michael "dies". That leaves you satisfied and excited for the next movie. In this one, he just kills some more people while Laurie strodes is blabbering cringe cliches for effect. And the other asylum escapee? What was the point of including him? The herd mentality hurt to watch and did nothing for the movie. 3/10, I like the flashbacks where officer Hawkins or what ever his name is looked like buck owens.
I really thought Laurie would finally confront him in this one and she would end it. I kinda felt like the trailer was misleading and showed something else that wasn’t part of the movie. It was disappointing to say the least, the cliffhanger at the end wow.. well I mean, I guess it’s not the last one, until next Halloween. Hopefully Laurie finishes Michael cuz I’m just tired of it lol I just want Laurie to win.
this movie SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKED
i don't understand why everybody hated the movie it was super good
The characters are all useless. No one bothers to hit him on head even once. Hahaha. Just wasted almost 2 hrs of my life.
Did anyone else see the silver shamrock masks
David Gordon Green gives us the perfect continuation of the original movie. Please give David Gordon Green the same job for Friday the 13th and Exorcist.
AT THE END Michael Myers IS GOING TO DIE I WATCHED IT YESTERDAY
Saw this in the theatres. It was okay. I give it a 5. Scale 1 - 10  Do not expect movie  from Jamie Lee Curtis.  The original Halloween from the 80s was 100x better.  I was disappointed on this movie ended and the roll played by  Jamie Lee Curtis
so he cant be dead, who came up with this shit... there is no logic in this fucking film. waste of time.
EVIL DIES TONIGHT!!!  Loved it. Cringe and all.
When Michael Myers rose up after the mob killed him I was f**king excited  Like wtf wrong with me
This has to be in the bottom three Halloween movies. It’s terrible. It’s probably worse than resurrection. How did they go so low in this one?
Shouldnt he have died from old age by now lmao
Love Jamie Lee Curtis! Badass woman she makes these films for me
Talk about a killing spree. How many people did he kill in this movie? Brutal and very gory deaths. 🔪👍
I just love how it still takes place on the same night in 2018, reminds me of Halloween 1 & 2
What actually pissed me off was that they really thought they can take him down , at this point you do yo thang Micheal !!
This film takes plot armour to another level
I’m glad I don’t watch movie trailers anymore. They give away so much. If you watched the trailer you basically got to see half the people he killed
Is it only me, that find those killing a bit... Tacky? In FINAL DESTINATION way... 🤔  I like HALLOWEEN, but found, sadly, this... *exaggerated*  numbers and ways of killings... Too Hollywood-like. 🤷🏻‍♀️  I just hope, Halloween will stay with it's ROOTS. 🤷🏻‍♀️ 🤷🏻‍♀️ 🤷🏻‍♀️
So 2:24 was cut from the movie
i’m really fucked up about the #HalloweenKills movie, i expected so highly of it just like i did with #malignant and i’m so disappointed it is not as bloody or as gruesome as they claim, it is not the most violent Michael Myers we have seen, (refer back to the Rob Zombie films if you want gore and brutality) the scariest parts were in the beginning, which, NEWS FLASH it’s in the trailer, other than that i was not impressed but the story line was incredible, the flashbacks were incredible but tbh this movie was just as boring and uninteresting as the 2018 film 🤷🏾‍♂️ the characters make horrible, life-threatening decisions and it was all over the place it made me feel like we were watching a campy 1970s horror film and that was depressing cuz we’re in 20-fucking-21. i wanted GOREEEE…… i’ll stick with the rob zombie films lmao thanks for wasting my time hollywood whores 🙄🙄🙄 conclusion: #HalloweenKills and #malignant were the worst horror films of 2021 (spongebob remakes are scarier to me) save your money AND your time!!!
I swear if they try to make myers mask look more slick and new he'll look more like William shatner every time I saw him in this because the mask looks better than the original its starting to look too much like William shatner 🤣
And that’s why they should’ve decapitated Michael when they had the chance.
Why is he so small this movie?, the dude is often huge AF in these movies.
The Apefather scares everyone at AMC theater Halloween Kills! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnBl7w24L30
😔 sigh, I had to question myself why everything made in America in this movie are so weak?
I don’t think the avengers can stop Michael Myers. Does he low key have superpowers. The ending was ridiculous, we all know they’re setting up for another sequel. Which is going to be awfully similar to this one, lots of stabby stab. I give this movie a -10/10
WORST MOVIE EVER LOW BUDGET MOVIE👎
Watched it today, such a comical movie
At the end they kicked his ass but he still managed o survive
Laura’s  daughter died at the end
does he ever die wtf is he
Майкал vs noobs 😭
He's back
bro i feel like michael not talking makes him the way he is. if we was talking the entire time he was killing it wouldn’t be that scary.
I just watched this movie and when the whole town rises against him with everything they got and in that point that I thought they finally killed him ,he got up and started to kill every single one.  And to be honest to you, I'm not happy with the end...16 times he cheated death so I think that he became more evil and only something out of this world is the only thing that can kill him. And I was thinking why the hell he still survive been shot and stabbed, so why they didn't chopped his head off but they didn't because there's going to be another movie..🙄🙄😕😕🥱🥱🥱🥱
*The most terrible thing about this film is STUPIDITY* 🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠
I watched the movie it is a very good movie
This movie is a complete joke, don't waste your money to watch it in the theatres. The characters are all idiots.
halloween kill s.   please release movie india country
Watched it last night. What a crock of shit that was. So unbelievable and so many mistakes. The first 10 minutes I thought this is gonna be good. Boy was I wrong. I would give it a 3 out of 10 just for the cringe in it.
Great slasher film 👍👍👍 Lots of fun , great kills.
So did Big John and Lil John have like a fetish to be killed by Michael Myers or something?
i watched this lastnight it was great!!!!! when are we getting another!??
People don’t understand it’s a fiction movie about the Boogieman
Best movie ever saw. Done so well.
11 firefighters with axes, saws and breaches killed. *few drunks in a bar "we'll get him with a baseball bat"
I am the biggest Halloween addict and this one is so so so awful. First all the whole pretending that none of the Halloween's ever existed just made me twinge..ok get rid of the Lori's daughter halloweens(in rob zombies she is annie).but why h20..u could have continued from there..a s now it has not to do with lori at all ..what???? Sure crazy kill scenes but no horror..edge of your seat scared..like a white mask fading into the shot...I dont need blood and guts..I want to be scared..and this Halloween did not give me any.kind of feeling except for disappointment
You seen this trailer then you've seen the movie.
Just got done watching it and it sucked ass!!
🙏🙏💐💐
It does have some bad ass shots ngl. But the movie itself is a joke. I'm a huge Michael Myers fan but at this point just give it a rest
Don't want to spoil the ending, but this is getting fucking ridiculous
if plot armor existed, it's name would be Michael Myers
Michael Myers looks like Joe Biden in this... wtf?
My fav part is when the kids are at the park and the little boy said  there’s a guy in a white mask den he says ohhh here’s right there then the little girl says ohhh hello! Lmaooo like wtf how u gunna say hello to a serial killer😭😂😂😂😂😂
Had watched the movie. Faker then fairytale! So unrealistic that is impossible to watch. Waste of time!!!
This movie piss me off so bad....
The same old storm trooper accuracy, run, fall, trip, hide, die
Man this movie wasn't as good as i expected at all Halloween 2018 was way better & halloween 1,2 were the best Halloween movies they show us how scary Michael myers is but this shit nah man don't waste your money on it
Whole movie not worth it I'm thinking he suppose to get his ass handed to but yet he remains off the chain again this time so easy why are they not killing this man
Halloween 2018 was much better than this. All the victims were stupid in this one. The script wasn't as good but the kills were good tho
Worst horror film I’ve seen to date. Total dog shit.
save ur money
Whoever edited this trailer deserves a fat raise because they made a shit movie look good.  I just finished watching this pile of crap and I came back to rewatch the trailer, and I want to see the version of the film this trailer is selling, not the bottom barrel garbage that was the actual film.  Don't waste your money on this.  Its literally THE WORST Halloween, and yes that includes the Rob Zombie ones.
I just saw the movie yesterday and omg I’m in love with this movie
What saddened me about this movie, they didnt have an encounter at all😑😑😑😑
In every halloween we are tired of this type of movie.
This was trash omgggg… everybody just let him kill them… I’m so disappointed… ima need the writers to do a better job… when ppl see a killer ppl run.. we don’t wait to be killed… a whole freaking fire dept 🤷‍♂️… 5 police officers in a whole city… Y’all did us fans wrong for this!!!
Just seen the movie sometimes things need to end no more sequels.
This movie Sucks! I thought this was going to be the final one. The movie is basically about a town  full of idiots with weapons who can’t kill a guy with a knife 🤦🏻‍♂️ the end is even worst! He is not inmortal, he is using a bulletproof vest and most probably he is on steroids. I need my money back.

Disappointment 😩
HOLD ON THE REST WILL BE SPOILERS YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! anyways in the movie we never saw the scene where the laura is holding the knife and saying im coming for you michael (or atleast i dont think so maybe im wrong) so my guess is it will be in the next movie!
Evil never dies
Hated all your ending, super bad👎
Saw it just now. Was bad ass.
Trailer looks good but the movie sucks or maybe I don’t get scared no more like when I was a kid lol common they shoot him and every one misses their shots lol too fake smh
Either I'm getting older or becoming a movie critic, my God I wanted to leave during second half of the movie. This it's the last one I watch in theaters :(
Not good.  At first the movie,Police can't shoot the bogyman.May be American police can't shooting well.That's why they can't shooting in the movie as well.

Que desepcion más de lo mismo,  esperaba algo que nos sacará de la misma matadera y que hubiera muerte  para Maicol que dastrete el horror no hubo nada más de lo mismo que fastidio ese director se le acabó la imaginación la creatividad me decepciona.
Guys, go into this movie like it’s a high budget fan film…it will make you enjoy it a bit more otherwise its fluidity and acting are cringey. The kills were great and Michael is just awesome even in his other crappy sequels.    BTW, Michael is Negan.
okay this opens with a person on a cell phone but then it appears that this event is taking place in the 70s I think but then jumps back into the present day and btw shouldn't the one lady be wearing a Halloween sweater vs the Christmas sweater.
one of the most lame movie ever....people reaction  were sooo unrealistic and slow AF...whole town including professional departments scared over 1 goddamn ordinary old man, seriously???....a 3/10 film to be honest...to add, i hate tis freakin film and its sound effects too....
Just saw it. Great movie
Spoilers and a couple of rants:              Wtf was that fireman thinking when he was spraying WATER on Michael? You brought back the original cast and did NOTHING with them. Laurie spent the ENTIRE MOVIE in a hospital. Is Michael fucking immortal now?! Why did Karen have to die?! What was the point of that?
Just saw it and while it was pretty good I expected better after waiting so long but I can't wait for Halloween ends 2022!
A metaphor for dRUMPf's "America."
what a SHIT!i watched 30 min and i had enough.This types of so called horror movies are not scary anymore.For the true horror movies lovers who know what i mean...ill rate this 1/10👎
Just saw it, DO NOT WATCH. Sooo bad.
Probably the worst movie I’ve watched
Just watched it umm im still confused so whos the guy with inmate suit they chased down hospital??
This was such a bridge movie
POV: your parents don’t let you watch rated r movies
Only thing I dislike abt this movie is tht they all act incapable of fighting back like die in the dumbest ways, or miss 20 opportunities to strike him.
ga mati mati dah
It wouldnt be the same if she wasnt in it
The best halloween yet
Fucking awesome movie
Watched it on peacock. If you have it,save yourself some money & a lot of disappointment. This franchise seriously needs to die. Yawn.
There's a club for people like Laurie Strode and  Sydney Prescott called "when will I have a peaceful life"
Bruh i watched it and bad, like bruh the whole town hit michael and the whole town and police department couldn’t kill one person bruh, like come on- i have to wait another year for the other part bruh-
Seen it in theaters yesterday and it was awesome 😎 the whole audience was screaming
Was highly disappointed with this movie. 😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞
If you're reading this, please don't watch this movie. It's seriously bad.
Honestly this movie is so bad but I enjoyed it probably because of that fact. The plot is so ridiculous, nothing makes sense and that made me laugh out load a couple of times. My favorite scene was LITTLE SPOILER  when Michael dragged that woman out of the car cuz she was about to get slaughtered by him and her husband was like "I love you babe". He said it in such a calm, casual way and didn't even try to help her. he just accepted her faith lol. I loved that  Anyway fun to watch if you are into trashy horror movies which are not beeing over the top, intentional trash.  Oh and that's also the thing with this movie. It feels like the writers were genuinely trying to come up with a good plot, and out came this shit show 😂
I like the last one better tbh
I say just 🔥 the newly remodeled Meyers house down to the ground and Micheal won’t have a reason to stay in Haddon Field. I have been watching this franchise since the beginning and Jaime Lee Curtis is banking off these movies. Can’t hate on that part of it been a fan of hers since the beginning she’s the original scream queen. This one I can only say is bad writing and bad acting, but I’m still intrigued and waiting for someone to just come out and say the man is the devil himself then I will understand it all.
Movie was all over the place. I was really disappointed in it.
Can't this mans die this dude is the most immortal dude
Where’s the army? Tanks and machine guns?Only the police can deal with him nice 😂
Bruh I went to the movie theater and saw Halloween kills its better than other Michael myers movies
Love it !! Waitinf next movie 🔥🔥
Çija robt prap nuk vdiç en kët rend hmmm...
i think jason and freddy should be on avenegers... they just don't fucking die
Spoiler Micheal Is still alive at the end 🤣
I’m sorry but the characters in this film were booked to look so dumb, the ones that had one on one encounters with him had enough room and time to turn around and run out the door
I didn't like it. Poorly written. Dialogue was bad.
finished watching this a while ago on my firestick and it was brilliant from the start right through to the end I won't or wouldn't give antin away but it is a fantastic movie.
This was God awful...save your money
Spoiler: laurie stays in the hospital for the entire film and doesn’t have a single encounter with him
The only good thing about this show is that Myers respects the pandemic and wears a mask, while others don't.
https://youtube.com/shorts/PNon2o9LxoE?feature=share
Took me two movies to ask… why is Judy Greer wearing a Christmas sweater?
Big disappointment. Already knew what was gonna happen in the following scenes. Characters were…. plain.
Looks like I'm one of the few who actually disliked this movie lol it was so cheesy and a lot of times where moments that didn't make any sense.
The movie had a lot of corny actors and moments. Micheal Myers stabbed a dude 4-5 different times with 4-5 different knives, I mean c’mon. Myers himself was even corny. It was more about the town’s residents instead of the actual star. Nothing like the good ole scary as hell Halloween movies.
I really enjoyed this movie and I loved that they brought back some of the cast members from the first Halloween!
All these negative reviews and I watched it  last night and concluded this was one of the best ones.
"When the Firefighters saved Micheal form the burning house. It was at that moment. They knew... they Fucked up" Jamie Lee looks like Dr. Oken.
That kill with the saw though jeez
MAJOR spoilers
Much like the second Halloween I expect this to be disappointing.
Wow.. just saw the movie, I have to say this was so much better then the last one. But. I wish they would use a little more original Carpenter's Halloween Theme music..when he is comming up on someone or when he's killed someone. Please keep it more to the original story line and themed music. Its more scarier that way.. Also,  where is her son , Josh Hartnett????? Bring him back he's part of the story line as well. Anyhow  I thought the movie was pretty damn good more exciting kills and gruesome. Great job...
This movie to me was kind of wack just my opinion
I appreciated the story line and the killings were amazing but fuck me in 2018 in america not one semi auto rifle was seen not one person aim for his head like what the fuck 😒  im no expert if a fucker keeps coming at ya aim for the face
They had the whole town on his ass and still failed.  Where tf is the national guard.
I’m in the middle of the movie and I’m commenting , good gore but man holy shit this movie is sooo messy like there is no story , nothing makes sense in this movie , don’t watch it unless you are complete bored , you may sleep in the movie too.  2/10 and the 2 cuz of the gore only
All of these movies are bad except the first one and the 2018 one
Skynet: jesus take the wheel  Michael myers: hold my beer
I loved Halloween (2018) and was really looking forward to this one. Just seen it at the cinema. Such a disappointment! I hope Halloween Ends will be better than this.
As a fan of all things halloween, I really wanted to love this movie... but boy was it horrible. Just all over the place.
Absolutely love halloween and got to say I bloody enjoyed this one loving the myers head tilt
Been to see this today.. and totally loved it.. !!! 🔪🎃
Same ol same ol
C'mon! Not even a little burned. Not one part of his clothing caught fire?! 🤣
As Shatners getting older this original mask is getting pretty close to its intended James T Kirk.
Worst one yet
Good 👍  10/10 great movie
fun fact: in the original movie there’s a scene exactly like the one at 1:56 but they couldn’t break the glass so they used a wrench. thing is, you could see the wrench taped to the guys hand  now they were able to do this scene and it is so awesome
La mejor pelicula de terror de la historia 🎃
Halloween the movie in 2 minutes!
"You want your mask? come and get it!" Michael: "aww cmon now my costume, give it back, not cool at all dude"
I love Jamie Lee Curtis. So pleased she committed to Halloween. Looking forward to seeing Halloween kills 🔥🔥🎃🔥🔥
Yeah so they FILMED THIS FUCKING MOVIE HERE IN WILMINGTON WHERE I LIVE AND ME AND SOME FRIENDS ACTUALLY DROVE AROUND TO SEE WHAT WAS UP!!! IT WAS AS IF MICHAEL CAME TO LIFE!!
I always try to find at least something good in a movie, but this was just awful. Movie made no sense whatsoever.
Does the age matter ?
Movie was amazing the graphics the music and the storyline, michael was raging, I deffo wasn't disappointed, roll on next October for the last one,
michael should sleep well now, never to wake up
This movie should have never been made.
Very good 👍 movie I love it
Why is everyone complaining about the movie? It was really good, not the best but definitely not terrible.
why the f are they spoiling all the kills?
This movie was nothing but murders. Micheal kills every 5 minutes of this movie, and its brutal as hell
This movie sucked , and I can’t believe we still couldn’t see his face after all this time 🙄
Just finished seeing it, Second half of the movie was awesome and gets you hyped for the next installment, first half isn't bad but if you don't like the characters then it is kinda boring until it gets to the 'nurse in the car' part, then it's like a surprise rollercoaster ride till the end. I did like some of the new characters. There is some hokey dialogue but once you get to the second half even the hokey characters become fun again.
how has no one overpowered this fool yet, jeez
This movie is horrible. The writing, script, acting, plot, dialogue, everything. It's very very bad
When his he gonna die wtf lol.. sorry if u haven't seen it prior to reading this but yes he survives again
How many times are they going to recycle this shitty movie?
Shittest film ever
bruh i feel hes never going to die omg i watched and huh was hoping he was going to die
Seen it. Might be the worst of all the Halloween's. Total crap, badly edited, badly directed, acting is terrible, dialogue is rubbish. I was honestly hoping Michael would kill the whole town.
The most stupide movie I have ever seen.  Totally rubbish, waste of time.
⬇⬇⬇ SPOILERS AHEAD (i warned you!) ⬇⬇⬇
a nameless turd , as expected . JML looks like steven seagal with Gandalf's wig, actors plays like amateurs YP channels, the scenario is dumb to death, obviously . like mixing new crap into a 40 y.o scenario to make bucks, it is  a damn waste of time . Z series actors who came to pay their rent , it is a joke , really . looks like a parody or some
Yooo this movie is BS…… i give up
Why they ain’t use the hose to attack his ass
A movie so stupid i want all cast killed by myers
Man I'm so glad I refused to watch any trailer for this before it came out lol literally showed the whole movie
Fucken horrible movie smh thank God i dint go to the theater for this 💩 even 5 bucks was too damn much smh
Movie was terrible!
im on that
...followed by... Halloween : Boring Tale of the lonesome psychopath...
The questions of our time: 1. How do we kill Michael Meyers? 2. How is Jaime Lee still bangin' after 45 years?
Cabei de assistir aqui...olha esse tá muito top o filme show de bola
This is the most stupid movie I have seen , like nothing makes sense , their shots dont even hit Myers like literally they been standing behind him and will be hitting on doors half a mile away . This looks like the movie made by someone who got high by smoking on meat.
Michael Myers is indestructable.... So....one day expect... Halloween: he's only gone and murdered everybody on Earth, the rotter....
And they'll make another
This movie was fn trash
I’m glad I refused to watch the trailer before watching the movie because they spoiled sooooo much! 😂
no one can kill the strong 80+ old female empowered wahmen! the pathriarchy is finished! its Michael Myers! and the younger female wahmen needs no man (snap snap snap fingers and chicken cocks head )
was an ass movie not like the old times not worth the movie
Just watched the movie last night. I've been dodging the trailers left and right and I'm glad I did. They showed so much in this damn trailer. They gave away almost all of the kills and for no reason. I'm kinda boycotting horror trailers for the time being, at my showing last night, the trailer for the new Scream movie came on. It took me 2 seconds to stand up and leave. I imagine that trailer spoils everything as well.
The Teaser should be the only trailer. Crowd is in for a wild ride.
amazing movie .the best horror ever watch
Why are the characters so fuckin dumb? Like wtf?
this one aged well unlike wrong turn. And now scream is back.
They ruined my all time favorite movie! This one is absolutely horrible! Comes across as super low budget 🤦🏻‍♂️ terrible acting, they turned to gore this time instead of horror/scary and it seemed so fake, looked so low budget. I just can’t believe they ruined Halloween and Michael Myers 🤦🏻‍♂️😡 I have no hope at all for Halloween Ends since they made it and this one back to back so I’m unfortunately no longer even looking forward to it 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
AYE MICHAEL YOU BACK 🤣
Several people walked out of this movie. I wish I had followed them.
i watched it, not good
1:53 😂 funny voice
Mickaël is big man ok no fat aaah in hospital .. so stupid 🙄 First time gay couples.. and black people .... So and everyone died ... 🙄
It’s not worth the hype lol but I liked it
Let me save y’all the trouble he doesn’t die
Didnt he get his head cut off
Waw!!!! Molto horror!!!
The film is so fucking stupid, what a waste of time.
Is this gonna serve as a closing to the series or what?
Just watched it I don't want to tell you it but it was really scary
As a fan of the Holloween series, I have to say this is the Worst Holloween movie ever. Real Talk
Just watched the full film. Distinctly amateur. Awful characters, bad acting and a complete shambles.
LAME
This is like GTA San Andreas everytime Michael dies he respawn like CJ here we go again…
In my honest opinion, I believe Halloween (1978), Halloween II (1981) and Halloween H20 (1998) are the best in the franchise simply because they followed the same storyline with H20 continuing from H2. In this garbage they showed Michael, who is an unstoppable killer and cannot seem to die, being arrested at the end of Halloween 1978 which is stupid, they should of included H2 1981 in the timeline.
I watched it yesterday
Who got the little easter egg nod to Halloween III?
For the ppl saying: _"The movie was trash, it's so stupid, unrealistic, Michael can't die- srsly??!"_  Well- Have you even watched the other Halloween movies before?? If so, you should know how cheesy these movies and Michael's endurance are!  Geez, it's a franchise from the almost 80's, _what did you expect?_ Want to get scared? Go watch the Conjuring or whatever sh!t you want full of stupid and repetitive jumpscares. *Let the fans of the franchise enjoy their movie in peace.*
Funny movie, a lot of opportunity and guns and weapons to kill michael myre, but everybody seems so stupid to do that 🤣
I hate these moves because you can just shoot him in the head
Debating so much on to see it, The plotline looks really tired rn, but I think I'm gonna do it
So Michael Myers will never die? The last fight scene was just stupid that many people and no one shots or stabs him in the brain.  Crush his head very stupid ending.
it's very disgusting ending
Check out the band "Twist the Knife"
Glad I stayed away from the trailers like a good boy. They show a lot. lol.
This movie had some really wack kills like how does he kick the door open and the chick shoots herself in the face
The whole movie was worthless garbage. Barely no micheal and the ending was the weakest crap trash i ever seen in any movie
HUGE HUGE Let down. Movie was trash compared to 2018. Micheal was in this movie for NO MORE than 8 mims together. GARBAGE. Makes me NOT look forward to Ends. SMH. Looked forward to this for a year for NOTHING. You guys had a whole year to make this better. And of course not.
I didn't care for this movie I'm glad it was free on peacock I would have never spent money in a theater on this. Like that scene when he steps out the house and all the firefighters are standing there like yeah let's take this guy on are you nuts like that one firefighter that just decides to hit him with the hose like really
I was really disappointed in this one. I loved the first but for some reason this one didn't hit me good. It's Ok at best. Michael was great...it was everything else that tanked. For me at least.
Good old Hollywood “realism.”  Michael Myers vs. army of men: Michael Myers decimates the whole squad  Michael Myers vs. one elderly woman: Michael Myers loses, hard
Michael can’t die ion think he know how 💪🏾
Spoiler alert: can't kill Mikey 🤷‍♂️😂😂
It looks to be quite literally overkill.
One old woman , the psycho killer , THRILLER & HORROR rounds
The movie was great
I am a huge fan of Halloween and this movie is actually good! I was scared this was going to be horrible but it wasn't, well blended with the 2018 movie.
this looks like a mediocre comedy movie mocking horror movies
Well I just watched it yesterday last night  -  And man this film was amazing but shocking also must watch!!!
Michael Myers been hanging out with John Wick , u can tell by killing all those fireman’s!
Abysmal movie. Had some decent kills but that's about it.
Thanks for giving us the whole movie in a nutshell rather than little snippets.
SLOW AND BAD ACTING 👎🏻
Just watched this pile of garbage. One of the worst films i have ever watched.
I just watched this trailer for the first time, after watching the movie. STOP WATCHING TRAILERS! THEY DO NOTHING, BUT SPOIL THE WHOLE THING! Amazing movie, I got the best experience because I don’t watch trailers.
I can't wait!! Plus hell yeah to the comment below 👇👇
decapitation didn't help, and they want to tackle him with a baseball bat????😲🤤😂...please stop😂😂😂. The only thing well done is his mask, the rest is the rape of a legendary iconic movie. Bad acting also.
Can’t believe a +60 year old man is being hunted by a whole town😂
!!!!MAYBE SPOILERS IN THIS COMMENT! BEWARE!!!!    Just watched it TWICE. Now the best parts of the film is Michael’s ferocity and the hints to his “super natural” abilities.  But its paced like it’s a part 1 to a two part series. Its shot in a way that the people he’s killed actually just sit and wait to die. Like some people died fairly. But majority felt forced or like added for a body count. Which is cool. But looses immersion just because.   The flash back scenes honestly are the coolest part after the kills. Because we get to see what David’s interpretation of a younger Michael Myers is MUCH faster than the older iteration.  Honestly, I enjoyed 2018 more. BUT, if you thought the kills were violent on the last film. Buckle up.  The realism of blind bravery being faced with true evil is so amazing. The scenes where some of the mob characters realize they’re WAY in over their heads after it’s too late is done so well. To see someone say “let’s get him!” To being faced with “oh shit HES HERE!”  And lastly, the old man beats the kid from the last one, in HILARIOUS reactions to a killer in their house. Lol  Like really. Watch the movie, but don’t expect a complete film. Especially not until the next one. Cause the new timeline series is going places.
we wanted to love this movie, but it sucked rotten pumpkins
I saw this movie, it's awful, the acting is so bad nothing makes sense even when myers gets surrounded its beyond one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen, if I made it I'd be dead ashamed.
Send in John wick “We call him Babe Yaga Well, John isn’t exactly the Boogey Man He’s the one you send to kill the Fucking Boogeyman”
Halloween H20 and Halloween Resurrection is scarier and BETTER than this rushed crap! I am furious how they ended this!🤣
I just watched it last night there ruining the Halloween legacy keeping it going the Halloween movies they make these days are so bad
This wasn’t how I thought it would go was surprised at the end though like how did no one see that lol
saw the movie. evil did not die that night
please dont waste your money to go see this crap it will be on dvd next week, this movie is like a old B movie  it's so stupid
Micheal dies
I love this story lol MIKE MYERS IS GANGSTA
This looks better than the candyman
Halloween Kills is the best film of the series after the original.
This movie is sooo sooo soooooooo stupid
This is the worst Halloween film I’ve ever seen absolute pathetic . No real story line it’s so cheesy & predictable and the Michael Myers acter is so shit and to top it all of he can’t be killed ? …
I love Jaime Lee but this was beyond awful!
It's comedy not horror hahahaha
Never ending
The dumbest horror movie I’ve ever seen
It's absolutely trash.... Poor acting... I can't believe that Micheal isn't dead after hitting numerous hits and stab by people... These sequels are bad...
Just watched  it so disappointing
This was honestly terrible.
Bro I swear after facing Michael so many times on Dead By Daylight, this movie was 100% on 🔥!!!
STOP SPOILING THE ENTIRE MOVIE IN YOUR TRAILERS. YOU RUIN IT FOR THE MOVIE GOING AUDIENCE @universal.
Can't believe people actually thought this was good. Completely disjointed. Just a clusterf*ck of scenes thrown together. Poor acting. No character building. Too much comedy. It's a horror, not a comedy horror ! And why if these are direct sequels to the original film, does all the dialogue and general feeling suggest that there has been so much going on with Micheal Myers in the last 40 years? Makes no sense. If you're a fan, watch it just for the kill scenes. Other than that, it's very poor. Halloween Kills..... the franchise. Stop. Just stop now.
JLC was like "Sarah O'Connor" of Halloween Universe
No spoilers but watched the film last night and if you’re a fan of halloween you’ll probably cream yourself watching this it’s a amazing movie
Michael's plot armor is so tough that its not even realistic and acting was cheesy. There are so many kills but lost its former glory. This is not the worst halloween movie but its bad thats all.
Post mortem ad nauseam
Omg this was a gud ass movie
I saw it yesterday....disappointed 👎🏽
Watched it last night its trash
Even when Jamie is dead, Michael will be digging the graves in search of her. Jamie should just join him, pointless trying to kill a person who a nuclear bomb cant even kill.
This movie was so bad
I’m done with this fucking movie it’s horrible they really can’t just kill of this dude already
Worse movie every!!!!!!!shite
Garbage.
the acting is terrible in this one
Looks like cash grab garbage, bumhouse makes terrible "horror" films if you can call them that
The characters in this movie were loud, cocky and arrogant, when Michael killed them one by one, I had a smile, good for them 😂😂😍😍
Just saw the movie.  I was rooting for Michael to kill all those annoying people and I got my wish.
*HALLOWEEN OVERKILLS*
This actually looks kinda scary ,but how many times will they kill him? He never dies
If there was a real person welding a knife and walking around as slow as Michael Myers did, the person would be gunned down within the hour🤦🏻‍♂️
terminator se queda pendejo al lado de este guey jaja ya me la vi y esta re' turbia, la recomiendo
horrible ending!!!  Guess only way to truly Kill Michael Myers  is in court much like with Jason Voorhees ( true story look it up ) .... sad for Nostalgic Horror fans to loose good old slasher films would have been kinda cool to see a sequel of sorts to the Jason vs Freddy vs Michael !! 😝 ALSO SUCKED THAT JAMIE LEE CURTIS had a back seat role in the movie !!!!😠
Good thing I watched this for free. This franchise will never get a penny of mine. I get it’s a movie but the script is pure trash. I almost laughed at every victim he killed because they were so fucking dumb😂
I found myself rooting for Michael again in this movie
How anyone can see anything good about this movie is a mystery, I guess the sheep mentality also transcends into a form of not caring. The movie was awful, not only the cast, the lines. How its directed, how this and that.   While we know meyers can't die even if you rid him with bullets, they wrote in the script that every god damn person with a gun should charge at him like they had a sword and then try and shoot him, not sure what day and age it is but for christ sake, it doesn't make it more suspensful, or awesome that they are using bats, and melee weapons.... give everyone a weapon and let them rid him with bullets, if that dont kill him there is no need for a backup melee weapon, its time to flee and find other ways.  This was awful, just pure garbage. The first movie was epic, a trilogy or an ongoing movie series shouldn't be done, for most movies its a disaster, and this turned into one.
They basically put the whole movie in the trailer 😂😂
I saw it its a good movie but its to  predictable but its still realy scarry
I predicted since they announced it that this movie would end on a cliffhanger. I feel like by the time the final one comes out, it will be revealed we're meant to watch all three back to back to back. like, as one completed huge film over the course of one single night. kind of like how Hatchet had three movies that all took place over the course of 2-3 days.
This movie doesn’t make sense at all.
So mad. Wack wack eack
This sucked. I hated saying that but i hope the next one is more legitimate than this. There is to much wrong with this. Wtf
Man I just watched it... kinda dissapointing
The acting in this movie was so cringe🤦🤦🤦
There will be another one.  This one was trash.  Just watched it minutes ago.
Great movie
One of the worst movies.. litearlly no point.. just kill.. i guess if thats what you want to see.. but there literally is no plot
I’m just happy that they didn’t decide to follow the original sequels. The whole thing with Michael being in a cult was really dumb to me. I just like how they made him a person who is evil incarnate and someone who doesn’t have a motive to kill which is terrifying to me.
Sadly this movie lacks and I'm a fan of the series. The movie is about Tommy who has a speech, has a drink, has a bat then gets hit with a bat but that is after he stands back and let's others have an attempt to kill Michael first. Please let the next installment be something more than this release as Laurie didn't come for Michael as she was too busy trying to chat up Hawkins.
What a terrible waste of time this movie was… it’s like a gruesome kill fest….  Pretty much every 5 minutes of the movie he kills someone. No storyline, no character interaction, no plot development. A lot of absolutely pointless and absurd scenes.The title itself is a spoiler - “Halloween kills”.  He just kills throughout the entire movie… end of story
how the fuck is this man not dead if a whole gang from the towns still does not kill him bruh
This movie was so bad.
They hella spoiled this movie so glad I avoided all trailers before I watched it
General public: so you quit because of the vaccine mandate?  Firefighter: no, I saw Michael Myers tear my buddies head off.  General public:
Michael Myers, the only thing that scares satan.
the scene when he kicked the door and that girl shot herself i was like damn now that’s epic asf, he got more skill every movie
wow this movie is the worst of them all
Apparently no one has a problem with Michael killing colored people ehh…
This movie was so FIRE!!!!
Just saw it, the movie blows.
90% garbage. The worst in the series (Rob Zombies bs included).
saw the movie. Michael got defeated (he is still alive) if Michael doesn't win next year ill be very sad GO MICHAELLLLLLLLLLLLL
Sorry but this movie was weak. Hollywood is funny with having cast that just make no sense on having. It makes this supposedly scary movie humorous. It was more funny then scary. Gays and black people just killed it for me. 👎🏽👎🏽 all credit to the original cast members but we live in a different era where the demographic and complaints of more diversity have to change its original art form in the movie industry. I’m sure some of you know what I mean. This was  just as bad as watching busta rhymes & Tyra banks 😁😁😁terrible
Awesome movie.
Awesome how they went from 1 and disregarded everything else and made Halloween 2018 it's direct sequel.
Halloween Kills….. this franchise
I seen it hmmmmm
So disappointed! This movie sucked!
Only thing good about this movie is the sound track
My review: Many great kills, but it's mostly sequel bait
What’s scary about Myers is that he doesn’t have a motive
This movie was horrible
This series is officially tired
"He's heading to his childhood home!" Eye roll. Where else has he headed the last forty years?
Don’t waste your time. This movie is terrible
Only coolest kill that made sense was the 50 cal. scene when he waited for her to one hand it lol but it was comedy rather than what I remember from the others
I don’t get the attraction to this character. He kills people that are smaller and weaker than him. He catches people unaware and doesn’t give them a fair fight. What is cool or badass about that?
Just watched in theaters. Not great. Watch for yourself. Total 👎🏼
I know its a movie but still, everyone's average IQ in this movie was -5.
Don't listen to the people telling you that this movie sucked. I swear i just watched it on soap2day and it was really great , the kills he made are brutal just like they said this movie would be . Can't wait for the next and final  one😔
To be honest this movie isn't as good as the trailer shows. It seemed more like a set up movie for Halloween ends for an hour and 45 minutes.  The one before is waaay better
I was really disappointed this version has at least 3 different scenes of women telling myers to bring it instead of running away when they could have after he's attacking and killing several men the 110 lb woman battle him one on one. This movie is just so unrealistic  predictable and very boring its just a slasher film with no substance  not even close to scary
I'm watching it now I'm fucking pumped Mike has been my guy since 1990 somthing !
Just came from theater he didn’t die !!!! Can’t wrap my head around this one yet…..
Movie was pretty good till the end. Shit was stupid as fuck.
Shit sucked.Not worth watching
just finished watching it that shit was fire 🔥
Feminazis are going to ruin another clasic.
Firefighters lives matter! 😪
Holy FUCK that was a good movie, he is TRULY a demon from hell
No one knows how to use guns in this movie. And when they have, no one even dares to shot him in the head for the kill. What a bunch of idiots!!!
So Tommy is 40 or 50 in this one. But was terrorized by the same Michael Myers 30 or 40 years ago? That would make this Michael Myers like... at minimum 60 or 70 years old. Maybe even 80. Woops.
If you’re a FAN of the 1978 Halloween... do NOT see this one. You will be disappointed. It sucks.
Movie was pretty trash tbh.
All together to kill this dude that using William Shatner's face mask. I believe Michael Myers is still the killer with personnality.
I predict Michael Myers vs Jason next.. we need something refreshing please  In this Movie. Michael Myers moved like he had taken karate classes, moving all fast like that. Isn't he supposed to be like 90 years old?
horrible movie , acting sucks 3/10
This was a rlly great movie
Movie was horrible
It's not that Michael's a bad ass,the people that want to kill him are just stupid asses
**SPOILER ALERT** "--------------------------------"He stabbed his sister in the tits" lol Simple. True. Classic.
I really don’t get the negative reviews. I think some parts were a little cheesy (pretty much any scene with Tommy Doyle or the mob chasing the mental patient) but I feel the good parts more than made up for the silly ones. Overall I really enjoyed this movie. Absolutely fucking brutal.
Those firefighters at the start deserved so much better bro 😥😥
I really really thought it was Carole from Walking Dead
This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, they absolutely destroyed Halloween,  like bad, absolutely God fuckin awful,  Jamie I'm so in shock you would be in this shit movie
so pissed hope y’all enjoy the freaking movie 😒
Worst movie ever guys I’m telling y’all
Great movie...if you want a good laughter of a grade D movie. I like how everyone wants to even the playing grounds by defaulting to a knife as a weapon when Michael can't die.
Great movie. I think he killed 50+ people… might be the most ever in one movie by Myers
I was rooting for Michael Myers through the whole movie lol cause of all the idiotic things the people did smh, plus Michael Myers went HAM like never before in this one!!!
Should’ve ended it after the last movie. This movie was pretty pointless and I say that as a big fan of the franchise. It’s now in the unbelievably ridiculous territory that the later sequels were in
Really glad I got to see it the day it came out I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, I think it was really cool seeing the whole town gang up and hunt down Michael
This is more than a horror movie. Michael Myers makes you realize at the end how hopeless we are fighting evil that will always keep on coming back and never die. One of the best films of the franchise. Loved the emotional touches, the epic flashbacks, the suspense, gore and thrills. The dialogue could've used some work and the screenplay on a tiny few of the attacks on Michael could've been orchestrated a tad better but everything else is well on point!
This movie was absolute *ASSSSSSSSSSSS*
Movie is ass
The 2018 entry wipes out all the other versions of the Halloween series except for the original. You folks need to realize this. This entry is the sequel to the 2018 entry as this 2021 entry is the sequel to the original.
That acting looks everything but promising. Leave this franchise alone for god's sake
I like how Jamie lee is always in these movies but they ruined it with these past two Halloween sequels. I mean shit Rob Zombie kinda fucked it up anyway so it doesn't matter at this point
Remember, Halloween is not always the same.
Kill Count:  Michael Myers: 29 Prisoner: 1  Total: 30   Halloween 1978 Kill Count for Michael: 7 2018 Halloween Kills for Michael: 18 Michael Myers 2018 Timeline Kill Count: 54
Espectacular me encantó ....
This was probably the best Halloween yet!!!👍👍
"I'm coming for you Michael" hallway scene didn't make it in the movie and that would have been great too.
He never dies, intell he dies of old age.
Just watched it ending suck ass
Just got done watching it it was terrible the worst yet
This was really bad, acting wasn't great, dialogue was god awful and to top it off, it's not in the slightest bit scary.
Ngl I wanna see a lot of kills the body count better be high af
If you are a big fan of the Halloween movie rich history, Watch This.
THE WORST WRITTEN, DIRECTED AND ACTED MOVIE ADDITION EVER! Do Not waste your money at the theater, watch it on Peacock instead.
Michael is some sort of a mutant now. Can't be killed.
Watching it tmrw
not again !
Michael should have arthritis and a siatica nerve by now he's been going for like 43 years now lol can't stop won't stop
All Jamie Lee Curtis has to do is move out of the country and Michael will stop lol
Just watched it! I thought it was fucking AMAZING! However, I do hope there will be another Halloween film in the near future! Great film, just NOT a great way to end such an awesome and iconic franchise!
Truly glad i didnt pay to see this tragedy. Bloopers, and incorrect info. I laughed more than i was scared. I will say, the bad acting by most was very comical. Wasnt worth the wait.
Honestly if you didn’t like it ... you’re not a fan of Halloween ... especially since the other ones were much horrible
The shape
ed your mask since 2018 still fits, Michael?
This was the worst one yet
Bro I felt that when she screamed "let it burn"
Just a Halloween fan here. I don't like this "1978" stuff. It seems like filler. Again, just a fan, expressing my opinion. It seems like this part is piggybacking upon the greatness of the original with some bad writing. If you like it, great. I just don't. I didn't expect it to be the original. I just expected more.
Well he won
Fui a verla hoy mismo y me atrevo a decir que si no es la mejor es de las mejores de halloween mucha sangre cuerpos por todos lados así es el verdadero Michael Myers
🔥 happy Halloween 🎃
Went to see Halloween Kills and I was very impressed. Deliciously violent and gory, brilliant soundtrack too. No spoilers but that ending wants me to see Halloween Ends NOW!! :D
Just got done watching it on Peacock. This was by far the best one. It had a real halloween holiday feel to it. I actually felt like Halloween was tonight fucking bad ass
Epic Movie Best One Yet
What about Halloween H20 where she chopped off his head in the end , GREAT sowing job EAH !!!
Karen dies Michael didn't ohhhhhh
The Loomis impersonation is one of the worst parts of the film.
The worst movie ever made!! Can’t believe it sucked so much!!! It’s 100% waste of money to watch this movie on cinema. They literally wants Michael Myers to survive… 15 damn people with bat and knives can’t even kill him ?? He got stabbed 6 times and got shoot 4-5 times and still not dead yet!? What a bad movie, I assume the director was on drugs, while making this video….
Brutality can't kill evil. It only breathes life into [it].
I like it! The guy literally walks and kills in slow motion, yet a whole town with its cops can't get him! Impressive 😂
By far the most brutal and gory Halloween movie ever  and probably my favorite! Wow!
This was literally the whole movie
I like every Halloween movie, but damn this one sucks.
Just got out of the cinema. It’s brutal as fuck and fucking brilliant to boot ✌️✌️
Halloween has always been my favorite movie of all time but Halloween Kills is the absolute worst one yet 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ I was so disappointed 🤦🏻‍♂️ terrible acting, gore instead of scary, dumb story, this one was awful 😡
They need to stop.  Michael M can’t be killed.
Who’s watching it in the theater tonight ?
Looks like a Halloween 2 remake , remake, remake of III with 2 essence
I just watched the movie,and let me tell you,it’s scary 😦
This movie was crazyyyyy 😵 I loved it
Here we go again…again.
shit movie as always.
Huge Halloween fan...this movie was SUCH a let down. save your money and time, its awful!
Turned it off after the first onscreen character was a man in womens clothing No thanks sickness
John Carpenter’s laughing all the way to the bank with another royalties check
What a crap movie
Borrrrriiiinnnngggggggg
It just gets ridiculous movie After movie. People do nothing, or has stupid moves (and stupid lines) and Michael Myers could be just a normal Guy, considéring the brainless attitude of everyone around him.   It's not crazy, not thrilling, not interesting anymore...
Just watched it what a joke man does o one know how to kill in these films? How about actually taking his head off his shoulders this time. Such hot 🗑
Came back after watching the movie let all agree it’s a 10/10
Should I watch all Halloween movies first if I want to watch this? Please help
Just got back from watching this and it was absolutely rubbish most of the people in our theatre were booing and left early yes it was that bad, it was just stupid 2/10
Just watched this movie. It was terrible
Such a brilliant gruesome movie with many kills &, the mask is a amazing & scary the make up team & the crew did a great job with this one, can't wait for Halloween Ends Next Year is gonna be so good 🎃🔪
Lol this looks 👍
just watching the movie its sooooo bad like prettyy baad
Watching right now, 47:10 minutes in and I'm struggling. It's awful.
Bro y’all need to let this man rest or find someone who can actually kill him lmao how many lives this nigga got 😭
what a shitty trailer. show too much.
it was a great movie
Omg dont waste your time watching this!!! Stop making these !
EVIL DIES TONIGHT!!! When did Halloween become a comedy. I’m currently watching this hilariously awful movie.. Michael Anthony Hall as Tommy Doyle priceless..
The Merkins had a movie now.
That was dumb
saw in theaters, felt like true horror again. i thought it was better than the last 1.
my friends: wanna watch this? me: one sec *presses on the trailer* *watches halfway* me: nty sorry 😰
gaddamn this looks so bad and boring.  I miss the goofy, fun, prankster Michael of the 78 version.  This movie looks like it has no practical jokes.
Meanwhile Freddy Krueger is waiting for his return
This looks so stupid lol my daughter and her friends are going to see this tonight
Number one of the worst movie i ever seen in my entire life
Don't like how they're going down a full blown supernatural path with Michael's character. Gone back to the cliche formula of every bad, boring slasher movie. Shame, the reboot was really good.
I haven't watched a stupider movie in a long time
Look that f**ker died in part 2 he was shot in the face and then blown up smh lol is he human or just got this supernatural ability lol
This movie SUCKS!!!!!!!!! 😒 so disappointed
Just got back from seeing this and yes this really did show way to much in the trailer
This should be called Halloween Woke. And like most woke things, it's terrible, even for a Halloween sequel. As a diehard Halloween fan, this was hard to sit through.
*SPOILERS* i can't believe they still didn't manage to kill him... As they always say once he kills he turns in into something stronger untill it's impossible to kill, Micheal Myers
I'm so ready 🙌
every single character dies except laurie, the sheriff and the granddaugher....her daughter dies.....michael lives, and its a great movie ...and the intro starts with the 1978 movie
Going tonight to watch this yay 😀
I liked the last one, but I just finished this one and I thought it was... Not great. Also, well I don't want to spoil it, but come on with that ending, just finish the story. Ridiculous.
This is legit, like a half a 'tard wrote and directed this movie. Its a pathetic part added to a good series. Edit: on the other hand.. they did put gay's and a lot of b l a c k s in it >.> so you know.. quantity over quality, I guess.
A terrible hot mess, give it a skip!
This is the 1st movie I was actually cheering for the killer lol does that makes me psycho 😈🤷‍♂️
POV u just got done watch it.
Ehh as a huge Halloween fan, my issue with these modern Halloween films is that they're not scary. Halloween was built on being scary.
Now we need a Michael Myers vs Jason 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Gods good
girl no don't stop it firemen wait what is that good guy time to kill  policemen all unit a Muderer on the loose citizens whats he doing eveybody hes killing for fun  RUN
Halloween ll (1981) is better sequel to the original
Ef me 🤟😖🤟
I just came home from the theater and man. This movie was absolutely intense. It had my heart racing and had me on the edge of my seat. You will not regret watching it. It's amazing.
Don’t waste your time don’t waste your money this movie is garbage.
YOU CAN SEE THE HALLOWEEN 3 MASKS
Today is the day yall
I knew it would be another one because in the last one something was moving in the fire plus Michel survived the fire in a very old one -_-
I just a few moments ago saw it on cinema and Christ almighty was it scary it was so realistic it felt like watching a documentary of many murders.
Watched the movie 10-15-21,,, Hollywood will do anything to keep making money
These guys gonna be screwed. Myers has gone Tier 3 now.
Not a fan of these new ones honestly just watched the new one..  It just seems like a Lifetime movie killer to me. The acting wasn't great, the killshots sucked in my opinion. You can predict everything that's gonna happen. I'll stick to the classic Halloween 2 it blows this one out the water!
Dizzam this movie was infuriating, I should've known by the title... Another cash grab and IMHO it wasn't even a great one. The plot was basic, the story was lame, and I must say this is the worst one since the original Halloween 3!
Dbd brings me here xD
And it all comes down to TONIGHT midnight viewing baby
only one man will not be killed by Michael Myers.  Camera man
Solo halloween va a y por US tedes
HICOS YA SALI O HALLOWEEN KILLS
is there an echo in here?
1 of da best ever !  Istanbul 2021
Today is the day let's freaking goo I'm so pump and excited once a Halloween fan always a Halloween fan 😤✊🏻🎃🔪
Jamie Lee Curtis reprised the role of Donald Pleasance in this one
Todays the day😈😈🔪
Man, Halloween has such a great premise, yet the keep making bad or mediocre movies out of it.
He doesn’t die
Wtf Is Kyle Richard doing here
Movie was lit but the ending…
Wait what the shape is back????
Jamie Lee Curties play the YOUNGER sister of Michael Mayers, and she looks like she is pushing 70. how old is Michael then? 80??????
Did anyone notice that not only 2018 is 40 years from 1978, but 2021 is also 40 from 1981 (original Halloween 2 ) and 2022 from 1982 (original Halloween 3)?. In Halloween Kills Laurie is the whole movie in the hospital, just like in Halloween 2.  They say that Halloween Ends will be different and will have a timeskip that will include the pandemic (in H3 there was not even Michael Mayers, but it also reminds me of the difference with respect to the others, as Halloween Ends pretends to be)
Michael Myers in this Movie was a Runt.............................
I hate allyson in this movie, quite useless and screaming uselessly😑😑🙄🙄
10/10 my opinion just got dons watching this movie
KYLE RICHARDS ALSO REPRISED HER ROLE.
Seen it already was legit forsure theyll recontinue to next movie ending was bad a$$ the only part that i didnt like was when an innocent mentally man was bieng chased by those sheeps ...thinking it was Michael who was in the hospital... after louries daughter told them like 30 faken times that it wasnt Michael but they kept chasing the poor guy... eventually they find him inside a room and with all the chaos going on the innocent guy jumped out of the window killing himself then when the guy whos using the baseball bat goes outside and see the man who killed himself says oh its not Michael Meyers duuuuuuh ...  no sh*t it aint theyve been telling you like 10 times it wasnt him so dumb tbh
I watching it..huh 2 murder
why all the charatcters wont shoot him at the head haha lol
Well... Now I have good news... The good news is, Michael Myers is still alive. The bad news is...           Michael Myers is still alive..
Idk what Michael is made out of but he be surviving fires, gun shots, knife attacks, saw chains, bats, ak47’s, bombs.  Is he ever going to die?
The last movie was absolutely garbage i hope this ones better
Halloween 3 refrence the silver shamrock masks on the roundabout
Im so happy because he still alive 🤘😈😈😄😃💯💯💯💯
It wasn’t good
Saw this movie yesterday the day before the actual release and I love the Halloween series, it’s my favorite horror series. But this Halloween is just NOT GOOD! They ruined it and it just not the same how it used to be. This is more of a Hollywood movie not a Halloween movie🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Boringggg
why people are keep milking the legacy of this franchise as to so the future generation would see how bad in the art of milking movies are ? LULW NOTLIKETHESE
i watched it on peacock it wasn’t the best as it was hyped it’s a decent movie
OMGGGGGGGG AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠
Just watched it what a shitty ending
We all know here Michael cant die, he has been shot multiple times, stabbed, hit with blunt objects, ran over a few times, fallen off balconies.
Is Michael aging orrr was he intentionally made to look like Jamie Lee? It’s crazy how we are all still infested with Michael after all these years, these movies always slap.
hi
I’m a Halloween fan but one scene when Michael goes into the old people’s house I had to stop it as it mentally disturbed me what he did to the old man I’m never watching Halloween ever again
Im done watching this movie ..not bad 😁😁😁 ..cant wait Halloween end ( final)
Cerita paling bodoh pernah buat...pistol apa semua ada xmau tembak kepala....cerita paling lembab
Just finished it could’ve been better in my opinion it’s all over the place the only thing good about this movie is the murders maybe I need to watch it again and the acting was cringe especially when that mofo said this is for loomis 😂😂😂😂😂
*WHAT A SHOCK, THE MOVIE WAS ACTUALLY GOOD.........BEST HALLOWEEN SINCE 1995*
awful movie 3/10
holy shit what a bad movie lmfao i just watched it. idk whats worse the fact that no one knows how to use a gun or the fact when they do shoot him in the chest 4 times with .357 he still lives and kills a mob of people that were beating him to death.
All from a Captain Kirk mask.
Boogeyman is real
That ending. Man did that leave me satisfied.
It'll be epic if Michael Myers won and killed em all.
https://youtu.be/C-oNX5RJy6M
Terrible! Absolutely one of the worst hyped films ever!
1:14 is the creepiest scene in the movie and the most disturbing I stopped watching it after that part, just the way he moves is so chilling and evil
We need Michael vs master chief fight
Oh my god oh no oh no I hmm Uhmm bye bye oh no
I don’t care what anyone says Michael Myers went supernatural and it was bad ass! The real boogie man exist now 🔪 🎃
Just saw it right now, It’s hands down a good movie. There’s gore there’s Myers being Myers a badass. You can’t kill evil literally Myers is pure dark evil where no light shines. I’m already want to see the next new Halloween 🎃
Seen it. Garbage. Literally the first half of the movie is dedicated to following sh!tsk!ns who have nothing to do with the franchise. Cheered when they all finally died. Then it, literally (literally), picks up half way through with the main cast. By that point you don't care. Everything interesting is in this trailer and it's not remotely interesting. Go back and watch the originals. This is SJW garbage.
dont watch the trailer it spoils so much
HELP! MY FRIEND SAID LETS GO WATCH HALLOWEEN KILLS TOMORROW AND I SAID YES WENT I HADNT SEEN THE PREVIEWS UNTIL NOW (3:28 AM) AND I DONT LOOK FORWARD TO IT NOW HELP
Is this a comedy? Flogging a dead horse, comes to mind. Jeez.
WH CANT WE HAVE A FRIDAY THE 13TH MOVIE LIKE THIS 😭😭😭
It's really not worth going to see, it's a really lame sequel.  Jamie Lee Curtis does nothing, just stays in her hospital bed and  gives a monologue at the end. Very disappointing.
Oh boy.  Well that pretty much sucked.  The first half is pretty good, at least... then we get bogged down in pointless subplots.  The ending is horribly trite.  This is vastly inferior to the last movie.  Can't win 'em all, I guess.
Passionate Flesh Wound Features Podcast review of Halloween Kills https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uykpNG5IFEA&t=906s
I dug this one 👍🏻
Spoiler alerts 🚨 Yo if y’all watch Halloween 2018 some of the victims Michael kills in Halloween kills are the ones from Halloween 2018 lol like that one chica who showed them podcasters the grave of Judith lol the couple who forgot his stethoscope etc lol 😂 so dope how Halloween 2018 showed us the victims lol but the car the Docotr nurse couple was in seemed wrong mm
I have an idea: show all the death scenes and all the important parts in a long trailer so nobody has to see the movie...ah, ya did that. Good job. 😑
Well the trailer was better than the movie. Bummer.
the wait is over
Hate the bar scene in the beginning it's so cringy but at least they killed those sPooks
Yo just watched it on October 14 lol but seriously watched it twice already ahhhhhhhhhh wtf man !!! Michael you one bad ass man omg the kills are epic and all rules are broken !!! My damn sweet bloody dreams y’all !
I watched da movie with 12 - 13
I would've moved away back in like 2003. Lol
If they don't kill him in this movie I think I might have to step in
I need a spin-off of Michael VS the old man from Don't Breathe
They always fked up the ending of these movie. The guy kills everyone without any problems or effort, yet an old lady is going to trap him or kill him again. WTF? O;o this is so stupid.
Just watched the movie. I aint gonna give no spoilers. But all I gotta say is DAAAAMMMNNNN!!!! This is an entirely whole different Michael Myers than what we’re used to seeing. This one is hands down the most brutal and intense movie in my opinion! It’s DEFINITELY worth it. If you’re a fan of Michael Myers, you’ll love it
It's Soo good
Bullshit the dude doesn’t die btw expect a new movie soon
Spoiler he dies😥
Wow ... I’m blown not even the world can stop Michael!
I just seen the movie and 10/10 great job.
Just went to the movies and see it and gotta say the BEST horror movie ending I’ve ever seen, seriously. Long Live Michael
Stop your gonna scare our firefighters 😢 Btw: thanks all firefighters tho Fr
I knew it was gonna be garbage. The last installment was unwatchable.
i think everyones had enough with these piece of shit movies..
Just watched the movie. 10/10. Perfect amount of storytelling, suspense and gore. Can't wait for the next one  On a side note: I'm glad I didn't watch the trailer...it definitely told way too much
Just got done watching it and omfg, I obviously won't spoil it though. But omg!
This movie is good 👍
Don't watch this trailer if you want it to spoil the movie for you. I'm so glad I waited.
Myers: My victims are coming to me? I thought this was Halloween not Christmas
LETS GO MICHAEL. All because it takes a hole town to take him out. BULLSHIT.  Lets go M MYERS

Just saw the movie today. I’m honestly surprised how many kills WEREN’T in the trailer
Disappointing. I hope the 3rd one delivers.
It’s the EPIC SHOWDOWN Myers vs the whole town. “Micheal Meyers is flesh and blood, but a man could’ve survived that fire” the reason these films are so iconic is the lead actress is a badass to take him on. It’s like she’s been living a nightmare all these years and she’s coming for him once and for all.
GARBAGE 🗑️.... nothing like the previous. Too much dialogue and less slashing, guts, turdy bowels etc. And just to think a year from now the prequel will be released. Hope they put effort in it and bring back that good old horror feel to it. Better than the Rob Zombie crap versions tho..👎
movie was good! just want to say  SERIOUSLY FUCK PEOPLE THAT TALK DURING MOVIES!!!!
Just saw it. Man what a let down
⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ SPOILERS ALERT⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️  Just Finished watching this OMG Brilliant Brilliant Movie  Only 4 Main Characters Left to Go Forward With Halloween 🎃 Ends   Was good to see the Mental patient from Halloween 2018  poor guy he was the Escape Goat for Michael  The Funny To New Characters where Big John and Little John , Gay Couple that Moved into the Myers House  R.I.P   The Worst Kill I'd Say Was Cameron and Karen's 😱😱😱  Hawkins is Alive??
Michael Myers should call his Brother > Texas Chainsaw
Just saw Halloween Kills, by far the goriest movie in the franchise. The kills are awesome and the story was pretty good. Y’all true Halloween fans will love it. ❤️🎃🔪
LETS FREAKING GOOOO ARE YOU KIDDING ME IM SO EXCITED!!! 🎃🔪🔥 who else is going to watching it on the 1st night? When it comes out. 👀🍿🙋🏻
Anyone know what time it will hit Peacock??
could you imagine how different things would be if annie never yelled "speed kills" to michael in the original 1978 film... he probably wouldn't have such the hatred he does for laurie.
?
Como puedo ver la pelicula completa online

They DON'T even kill him in the end. They literally let him leave. What a waste of money.
Silver Shamrock masks from Halloween III
I'm ready for this
Poor firefighters trying to save people 😢😢😢😢😢😢
Mikey is a baddddddd Dudeeee. He has kicked to much ass to die..
That looks flat ass scary.
Halloween epitome
I have Peacock Tv so I will be watching it in the comfort of my home.
I just finished watching this movie and it was damn good has a funny twist on the end but that's Halloween for you. Good movie
😍😍
IM SEEING THIS TOMORROW AT NIGHT YEAHHHH
from 1978 to 2021 the body count is def more than 3,000.
This is gonna be the best one yet
Please don't go back to the supernatural shit again.
I wish Loomis actor was still alive. He would have been great in this
Are you ready for the Halloween? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF6eYhUPdqY
why dont you just show all the kills in the trailer?
Delete the scene with the firefighters.  Too many firefighters have died by being attacked like assholes like this one.  I will boycott this movie.  Hollywood has now gone too far.  F**k them!
last one looks a lot better, guess we’ll have too see
Just watched it OMFG!!!!!!!!
Afters noah is there:)
Absolutely Awesome pick up, I can't wait to see this
i just saw this movie and  my god what a stupid movie it turn out to be
Im super hype for tommorow!!
Sounded like Michael Myers is back for revenge in this one.
Love this movie 💪👍😁😍
had to come back and watch the trailers and i just woke up from a dream and apparently my brain created a whole new car scene with different people and different kills holy shit
People say it’s scary but it’s kinda like an action movie to me.
I thought Laurie strode /Jamie Lee Curtis killed Michael by chopping off his head with a fire ax in the movie Halloween H2O
They literally evolved Micheal so hard in this movie
They should make a Jason vs Myers 🏆 🤷🏻‍♂️
Best movie ever ❤️👌💯
I love this new timeline  I think the movie is tomorrow Right?
Lieutenant: "Grab my hand!" *Michael grabs hand* The lieutenant: "hol up"
Halloween 2018 did not need any sequel at all. But hey, why miss a perfect cash-grab opportunity? I just hope I am wrong, but something tells me I am not.
Wth J.L.C. chopped his head off so how is he still alive
2:17 “Do it” lol he is for sure gonna do it don’t worry
they just... throwing anything out these days. Rob zombie already messed it up... now yall just.... damn
I better not see Michael busting out Kung Fu moves when the town fights him
Here we go again
Is it still exciting (entertaining) watching movies where the storyline is ‘i kill you better’ in 2021? We should develop some demands even for slashers. Myers should blackmail Grandma to kill instead of him, for instance 🍿🤣
Just saw this at a special preview.  It's really bad.  Not scary.  There's a lot of gore, but it's all pretty obvious and cliche.  There's only one kill that I thought was fun or interesting.  The story goes absolutely nowhere.  Jamie Lee Curtis stays on the sidelines the whole movie.  They're trying to hammer out a trilogy, but they clearly didn't really have an idea for the middle part.  I have a strong suspicion that when the third one comes out next year, you'll be able to watch the 2018 Halloween then next year's finale without watching this one.  You'll miss the deaths of a few named characters, but that's it.  I know that the devoted fanbase will watch no matter what, but if you're on the fence...skip this.
goku claps
I love that: "Somebody in there?"
Only she can handle with Michael  I fuckin adore you Jamie
I’d love a one on one with Mr Myers , best man wins
Enough already.
There going to be another Halloween movie dipshits. It’s called Halloween ends.
Since I was kid this movie never ending..
Blumehouse productions, oh boy.

Bro Is relentless 😂
Scary evil killings
1:46 SINCE WHEN!?! Michael Myers is the shape! Christ John Carpenter, did you forget your own character lore!?
Yooo I can NOT wait!!!!🔥🔥🔥
They better not mess this up being that the theme is "killing Michael" Really? first off how are you going to do that? Millennial PC femdom/Girl power didn't work in the last film, shooting him, stabbing him, setting him on fire ect.. Even if they do, they SHOULD know what's best in being that they better not kill of Michael. That's not what the fans want, we don't want a reversal victims X Myers, we just want a fun killer movie with a body count. Stop trying to make it trendy or something else.
What I've noticed from watching these movies and this trailer is that the more violent of a weapon you try to use against Michael the more violent your own death will be
Literally how at this point he’s a alien
Funny how jlc keeps coming back from the dead especially since she was killed when thrown off hospital roof lol...... lame man lame
This has just gotten silly as this point. They need to find someway to tie all the Halloweens together ( save the Rob Zombie remakes) such as, Laurie dreamed the whole thing past the original 1978 Halloween. Might be a stretch, but it's the only thing I can think of for it all to make sense.......
They'll put him through a meat mincer in the next one and then 20 years from now they'll drag Jamie lee out of the nursing home for the next installment
How I would love to act in any part !!!!🎬🎭🎬
It’s coming soon:)
Can't fucking wait!!!!!
hay que verla ¡¡
GAGGING to see this. Can't wait to see how it goes and how it ends
The fire fighters stopping the fire: WERE DOING OUR JOB WOO  0:33  The fire fighters: Oh shit...we just fucking saved michael
Did the daughter change...?
Ngl what did they expect to happen when someone sees a house on fire. “Oh look John that house is on fire”  “Sure is pretty isn’t it” No, they call the fucking fire department

This is getting as bad as the fast and furious series
So happy she's doesn't need stunt doubles. That's Iconic". And take there Job professional.- California love you 💥🥢 Lindsey Wallace 🏳️‍🌈 #halloweenkills 😍🎃🤸🍁
Laurie  wants revenge for killing Jamie Lloyd
Michael Myers today go to space now... congratulated!!
https://youtu.be/ILg2Cr0ZZWA
Is he like a demon or what that he cant die? Hes like killing confidently and US seems very hard to escape with these kinds of crime. They should hire reality as writer next sequel.
cant wait to see this on dead meat complain about it.
Welcome michael
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 John Carpenter is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Saw where j curtis associated this movie with the Patriots being held  without bail, while no charges have been yet lodged, in solitary confinement for peaceful demonstration. Not surprising that this washed up old fart should kiss the @@$ of the deep state hoping to purchase  another, just one more, minute in the limelight.
I’m coming for you Michael 😂😂😂 she lame
She’s so old 😂
Can’t wait. I like how they are going with he is EVIL
where tf is her son?!
i seen these trailer many times and the last movie of Halloween and can't wait to see this one it kills
Gonna watch this with my friends wish me luck!
Michael with that "come at me bruh"
Comercial,comercia,ya se la cargasteis...ahora resulta que es inmortal ...ridículo😂🤣solo buscáis 💲💲💲💲
Look at how the turntables have turned. A real genre shift.
It's obvious the democrats are back in power as we're being resold the same old nasty sh*t yet again.
I LIKE MICHAEL MYERS 💀👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻
HELLYEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOOKS LIKE A MASTERPIECE
Dumb skinny feminists kill Michael Meyers? Lame ass movie
“Ok Michael, We’re Thinking Of $25mil base salary plus 5% gross ticket sales for you.”-McBride -“...”-M -“Soo, Playing Harball Now Tom Cruise Style  Huh Michael?!? OK OK!! $30Mil Base and 7.5% Gross Ticket Sales!!”-McBride
I really hope this is better than the last one. It was definitely not as good as many people made it out to be and the excuse "best one since the first" is completely redundant because it's not like that's tough to pull off. 80% of this was scenes just ripped from past entries in the series and just remade with more money. Laurie being a badass was laughable too as despite this apparent fortress she built, both her granddaughter and Michael were able to just walk on in with no issues. Laurie even sat right at the front door so Michael could grab her through it, which was awfully nice of her.
I know Michael will survive this movie cuz they already have Halloween Ends set for next year
Firefighter: I’ll get him with the saw Michael: we’ll see about that
Could universal just stop making sequels for just a second
a group of strong firefighters can’t kill jason but a grandma can?
these firefighters do have some steel balls, they do try to kill Michael, but due to them being not trained enough they well... you know
FUCK YEAAA 🔪2 Days away. I am so ready . This Michael looks like he’s bringing serious kills on this one . But I’m dying to know how the Strode Ladies are going to destroy him . And can’t be happier that Jamie(Laurie) & Michael faces off again once and for all . Fuck him up guys even tho we know he don’t die 🥴🤣 least cripple his ass
1:48
The dynamic between Michael and Lori is amazing
Yo am I the only one who gets goosebumps when listening to that violin like OH MY GAAAWWWD
I’m just now correct the da Vinci code The more Michael kill the stronger he becomes
I’m just now correct the da Vinci code The more Michael kill the stronger he becomes
Literally never seen the original Halloween. Watched the 2018 movie today. Liked it, now I need to watch the rest.
Allison: Do it! DO IT!  Michael: "Not like that I won't."
bruh she  said she’s gonna kill Michael but she said that last year and the year before that… forget the past 50 years!!!
Pedro
Pedro
Back in the hospital it’s been a while since she’s been there
I wonder if any of the firemen end up just running away from Michael 😬 like I would be like “YEP alright it seems like you made it out. BYE” 😹
When Michael takes the fireman’s hand… perfect! I can’t wait for this! I’m happy they didn’t give the entire thing away in the trailer too like other movies these days.
Spoiler alert Laurie will have the same spell as Michael Myers the way she obtained it is she been chasing trying to kill and got away alot of times in the other movies  from fighting Michael this explains why and how Michael is trust Me this 1 is gonna be good
Man I cannot WAIT for this movie!!
Love that little season of the witch reference
If I watch this movie and don’t see at least 10 firefighters will buzzsaws and fire axes ganging up on Michael then I’ll be very disappointed…
WHOA!!!
Evil dies tonight yea no it does not There is another sequel after this
same shit over and over
Michael Myers back in business! Fuck yeah
Amazing work from the trailer company, really top-notch! Thrilled to see what happens.
This movie was really good, the deaths were amazing.
“My grandmother was right, The Boogyman was real” What’d you think? The murders were just in her head?
i love this series. the new movies have been great.
Three days.   get ready for the best movie for the year  October 15th, be ready. Bring a knife for protection just in case he tries to end you, ALWAYS keep your eyes on him, he will vanish.   Be careful partner, be ready for the war.
I love these kinds of movies, i do hope Friday the 13th returns again i just love Jason as a killer and 2009 version was pretty cool and was a fresh return to the first 3 "root-trilogy" i think it's time they now recapture parts "4, 5 and 6" with Jason presumed dead but a creepy killer tendencies in Tommy Jarvis but who is actually a good guy, then Jason seems to appear again but this is a copycat killer, for the end the real Jason finally returns and kills a bunch of people we get a spectacular fight scene with the copycat and Jason with Jason eventually killing him, tommy and the others find him and realize that Jason is out there and pissed, not sure if it should end right there or if we continue long enough to see tommy lure Jason into a trap of sorts and then it ends. But again I'm just speculating when it comes Friday reboots i think they should recapture 3 movies of the originals because they all have good enough parts each to flesh out an entire film with just good stuff.
Will only watch this cause I love Kyle Richards
That description " starring a woman " You can help it right hollydumb ?
MICHAEL must kill Laurie's cringey grand niece and disfigure her daughter in order for the trilogy fight to have any weight . This series is becoming a joke esp when they cant decide if they want to make the shape more super natural or human, it takes you out of the movie and makes it amateur hour trilogy fight to have any weight .

Who’s going the 14th instead of the 15th?
This will sound really random but lemme just say how much Halloween means to me first time I watched it I was 8 years old I fucking loved it I was the second one when I was 10 and I didn’t watch the other ones I saw h20 and the other one it was good because of my age 11 at this point and then I saw rob zombies Halloween at age 13 loved them and by the time the 2018 one came out I was 16 couldn’t see it in the cinema sadly but now I’m 19 and this will be my first Halloween film I will be seeing in the cinema and first rated 18 movie ad well I’m gonna frame my ticket when I get it because it will mean a lot to me like Halloween does roll on Saturday because that’s when I’m Seeing it
Why? Why can't they just finish it and leave it there? They did far too many the first time and like the last film, this will finish him off.... only for him to return again. It's so lame!
Tirititirititiriti tirititirititiriti ay que terror que terror que terror
GIRLS ITS SPOOKY SEASON BABE!! 😉
Can't wait to see this as I remember the first one scaring the chap out of me when I was nine xxxxxxx
Wonder can he beat Thanos
? He shoulda died long time ago when they cut his head off
I want to see michael vs jason
My man's pissed
AHHHH IM SOOOO EXITED!!!!
Finally He Is Back! Reply You Saying How Scary And Amazing This Movie Is Gonna Be
It took me the longest to realize they are chanting he dies tonight and u can read their lips
Sequels been announced: Halloween Ends Halloween Ahes Halloween Rises Halloween Chills… ...etc rinse & repeat every few years easy 🤑
ñ
no don't bring back the boyfriend!!!
why dont they ever get like a tec 9 or some automatic weapon against him. oh more movies, i forgot
Iii
How can u bring bloody knife at hospital?
This "we're women and we're going to stand up and fight" stuff is getting really old. And it's funny how the film, as the one before it, is painting Laurie as some Michael Myers expert when she only had a single encounter with him, and especially with him not being her brother now, it makes even less sense. They made the specific point of eliminating the sibling bond between Michael and Laurie....only to STILL have them tethered together. Halloween 2018 wasn't bad (in fact, I thought it was better than some of the other films), this one might be okay, but this is just growing....tiresome. I'm morbidly curious how the series would have turned out if they had done as Carpenter originally envisioned which was starting with Halloween III, the series would have become an anthology series, with a new film released every year around a different premise.  Sequels are already cliche.
I think it has the purge vibes
wheres the R-rated trailer??!! we usually get at least 1 of those!
I knew he was alive on that fire
Here we go again !!!! Boring yet ??
More bullshit  Like the last 84 movies   They are SOOOO FUCKING BORING
Michael Myers literally clutch the whole fire team.
Who calls their grandmother "Grandmother" ? Call her Grandma. Or call her Laurie. No one calls their grandma "Grandmother".
Can’t wait to watch this in peacock
This franchise needs to stop
I swear if he dies. Ill always have a hatred for Jamie lee Curtis
Can they for once just have a movie of nothing but different ways for him to die?  100 ways Michael Myers dies and I mean really dies. None of this he comes back to life shit. Like he’s turned into powder… fertilizer. I’d paid for that. This movie… no interest. More of the same
Aguante Jason!
Imagine Kekse Palmer in this movie ! Amazing
They should have put tommy Doyle in It 😒
Wow….. still going on….
So from now on Michael Myers does not die ever...he is immortal...we are going to keep getting a new Halloween until Jamie Lee Curtis cannot get out of her bed anymore...then it is going to be rebooted AGAIN and who the fuck knows (I wish they ended it with the last one I loved that ending)
Spoiler alert Jason vorhees pops up at the end 😉
"My Goodness they finally got the mask right".
Looks like a game
WOW SHOCKER HES STILL ALIVE
an easy solution :  bring out the spas shotgun
donlot ah
Oh my god this movie horror😳
Bro just call the national guard shit would be over by now 😂
That buzzaw scene was edited. There is more to that fire fighter's death im sure of it
not a big fan of the new music though,,should have left it alone
'Evil dies tonight'. Then what will you do for the final movie 'Halloween Ends'?
I like that they made a sequel to 2018 because the timeline is different. He isn’t Laurie’s brother in these
Don't cut any scene! This looks awesome.
Haddenfield population zero lol 😂
It's a hunter's moon
1:09 us this Michael?
This looks dumb as hell….but I’m still going to watch it. 🤷🏻‍♀️
The whole hood finna kill Michael Myers in this movie
Im calling the police
I’m rooting for the boogeyman this time!
4 days to go until release. I'm pumped, won't lie
Mask is flame proof I guess
Michael at the ending be like: "The f**k, where did you all come from?"  Them: "We watched all of your movies, we learn from our mistakes, we ain't attacking alone, cause now you're playing solo battle royale. 1 vs 100 mf."
The hunter...has become the hunted...
Well… this looks pretty shitty!

Lmao YOU PROFESSIONALLY OFFENDED SNOWFLAKES CAN’T EVEN HANDLE *FICTIONAL* HORROR MOVIES WITHOUT DEMANDING CENSORSHIP 🤣 Whoever signs that change petition is pathetic Better not cut it
Just seen a great Easter egg, the merry go round scene the body’s were wearing the masks from season of the witch 👍🏼
Laurie Strode: "Evil Dies Tonight" Le Universe: 🤣️🤣️🤣️ Michael Myers: 🤦️🤦️🤦️
JLC always swings for the fence. Every time and is the best woman to ever play in  lead in and survive in a horror movie.
So people are talking about taking the killing of firefighters scenes out of this movie. Bruh??
Does anyone wanna know why he can’t die
HALLOWEEN KILLS,....No shit. I thought he was a babysitter.🙄
How did I miss this trailer, Jamie Lee Curtis? He'll yeah!!!!!
Michael would be about 70 now ! Tough old man 😆😆😆
Can't wait to see it on Halloween.
If he don’t go down this time…imma have to step in
Silver Shamrock!
God I hope Michael still survives this movie. Hope he just finally kills Jaime Lee Curtis in this movie and the rest of her family. Or continue the horror by having the new daughter or whatever continue the movies. Cuz it would be real stupid if they actually kill each other in the end. Cuz that kills the legend for good. And that just can’t ever happen like ever.  Just like Freddy and CHucky. Michael should live on forever. So just hope Michael finally takes out Jaime Lee Curtis in this movie if this is her last and final Halloween. And I call her by her real name cuz this film is her best work. This film made her to who she is. And that’s awesome
Its the hunter's moon...
Perhaps this time they should consider decapitating and/or dismembering him, cremating him, wetting the ashes, then separating the ashes and spreading them throughout each continent.
"DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!"  Why are you saying that to Michael Myers? It's Michael Freakin' Myers. He will always "DO IT!" He WILL DO IT no matter what you say to him!
Dang, these deaths are clever and brutal........I love it
The Violin theme in this gave me chills the first time I saw this. So hyped!
Michaels being real nasty with the kills this year 💀💀💀
Love Michael myers he kills everyone loves its just not skinny people
Damn micheal is a good assistanter and invincible
I want to see what micheal looks like under that mask
FFS how many times?
It’s got to end with Michael dying because these films ain’t no fun knowing he’s got plot armour
Love how they put the silver shamrock masks on the victims.
Michael Myers v Jason Voorhees film needs to happen
I am eight years old and this sounds so fun to watch 😃✨😌
Im 12 and i wanna watch it sooooooooooooooo bad but my mom says no
1:33 I love the reference to H3, Silver Shamrock masks! ☘️
In my head Anthony Michael Hall is still a 16 year old and the fella in this movie just has the same name as him
Why they have to kill old people
When this movie comes out James needs to come up with a kill count
Dude, he will never die anyway if someone puts him in an acid tank he's gonna still alive
After watching 2018 Halloween I download and played all from 1978 till 2009 in 3 days
He never dies wtf shoot him with a fucking tank
im not the biggest fan of the halloween franchise but DAMN i will watch this one
a new fun halloween song for your playlist! GHOSTED 👻  https://youtube.com/channel/UCtkAdwgUJJpY-HzFwOpix3g
Watched the original and thought it was good but the sequels turned Myers into Dom freaking toretto!! He would survive almost anything and as the sequels kept coming out the more ridiculous the films would get.. this really is like fast and furious but in the horror genre
Get rid of Jamie Lee Curtis and you have No 🎥 Movie.. She's the IT FACTOR
Best horror movie ever!!!
I just watched a Jason video and got confused thinking this was Jason
"I'm coming for you, Michael." Hyped for this amazing sequel
Anyone else wanna see Micheal V Jason
Yeah✌💀☠😎
Idk who the old woman is, but already want her to die in the movie😭😂
HALLOWEEN 3 masks: 1:33
Bro a 5v1 how the he'll yall lose
Michael emerged from that fire. ...pissed...  he's mad, mad
ES MEJOR SI LO COMBINABAN Q PARTE DE DET UN PSICOPATA ESTABA TAMBIEN POSEIDO DE DEMONIOS COMOEN 1978
Those firefighters get bodied at the beginning At the beginning James found his golden chainsaw winner
For them to show so many kills in the trailer, I imagine the body count is going to be high af, that will be a fun dead meat episode
Like every other sequel/prequel out there, this will be shite, but still everyone will go and watch it
Wtf with the old lady she is so ridiculous!
I can change him…
Holy Shit! If the movie is as good as the trailer....gonna be dope!
Take it, Take it. Now Kill it!
Grand sis and grand brother Halloween kills lord I love horror but I feel I would pass out watching this one.
Most. Badass. Horror. Trailer. EVER.
Are we the public supposed to believe he’s immortal? I’ve had enough of these movies
...he's either gonna die or someone else becomes the killer in the 3rd one.
So it's 2 of 3 movies.
Repent Jesus Christ is coming soon…
Matthew 3:2…
This is gonna be one of the BEST ONES 🤍
Love how they got the Silver Shamrock masks from Halloween 3 Season Of The Witch
2090 evil does tonight
Myers vs Jason….lmk in the comments
They demonizing god smh don’t see this movie
Where has he lived and how has he supported himself all these years?
"You can't kill the boogeyman"
OH HELL YES IM SO GOING TO SEE THE MOVIE WHEN IT COMES OUT I SAW ALL THE HALLOWEEN MOVIES IM A BIG FAN OF THEN
Just drop a pallet on him
But you said that last year
The intents music remind me of "Sonic.Exe's" soundtrack. It, could perfectly fit in the official fanmade horror.exe game.🤔🤔
It’s like what they say… “Legends Never Die” 😈
The movie series should have been over he should of died long ago
Firefighter : TIME TO SAVE LIVES! Michael Myers : wait did you say take or save?
What happened to the art of making a fine film trailer? I thought I was going to get a glimpse and I got a synopsis. Why would anyone greenlight this trailer?! At least this has taught me not to watch the Scream trailer.
1:34, are those masks a reference to Halloween 3?
Gotta love the nod to Halloween 3 with the skull, pumpkin, and witch masks.
Jamie Lee Curtis portrays Walking Dead Carol in this spine+tingler.
Mike Myers is back
Literally can't wait 😩❤
Whoever make petition to cut firefighter scene is so dumb.michael has been killed lot of people.it doesn't matter what your job are.
I really hope this doesn't get the IT 2 ending
Laurie is a great example of a badass grandma
Halloween holiday wouldn't be the same without a Halloween movie well since there is one this year makes this Halloween holiday much better.
Trailer is a old lady threatening Micheal the entire time lol wth I'm worried about him for the first time
Dam Michael is fire proof
If i was those fireman i would have been like "i don't get paid enough to put out a fire of the house where a immortal physcotic killer supposidly died"
I love it it’s a mix of rob zombie Michael Myers and the OG Michael Myers
Where is miley, demi, selena or ariana for a movie like this, it would be great to see them in a slasher movie like this 🎃🎃🔥🔥 #Halloweenkills It would be epic
Looks good
Eqto tiver rendendo moeda p indústria cinematográfica. Tá bom.
I still cant get over where he comes out of the house with fire everywhere and the firefighter had a petrified look like he saw a unreal thing like a ghost.  This is probably the best movie trailer ever its just so damn good.
"Halloween doesn't kill people, People kill people"
Jamie Lee Curtis has played Laurie Strode in films released in six different decades from the 1970s to the 2020's: Halloween (1978), Halloween II (1981), Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998), Halloween: Resurrection (2002), Halloween (2018) and Halloween Kills (2021).
I can't believe they made another stupid Halloween movie same plotline every single time they think they've killed Micheal and he comes back because the idiots in Hollywood can't come up with anything original anymore.
Dead meat watching this trailer: well FU-
Dear Lord, another one? I imagine this franchise ending with Michael standing beside of a 90+-year-old Curtis deathbed saying something like "I knew I'd outlive you. Well, at some point, anyway".
This looks so good but hopefully this ain’t the last one
yawn
Has nobody ever said to Laurie no offence but can you like, take one for the team here and let your brother get it out of his system so we can all chill?
THANK YOU PEACOCK!!! :)  I will be enjoying this in the comfort of my living room!
They need to make one final one (not a remake) they should carry it on from 8 where he was took to the coroner and he opened he's eyes, all we heard was a scream. They need to kill him off
Call in scooby doo yall. They will take his mask easily
I had a dream that Michael was chasing my friends and I, trying to kill us. But he would only kill those who were afraid of him. And there’s been so many of these movies that my friends and I were no longer scared. And this irritated Michael and he got desperate. So he dressed as a lumber jack, still wearing his mask, and would constantly twerk on us with his big meaty cakes. And he would shout things like, “is this scary enough!” Or “do you like this! Is this what you want from me!?!” It didn’t frighten us but it did make us uncomfortable. Anyway Michael never killed us but he became tiktok famous for being thick and shakin that thang.
Holy shit Guys, I think Michael is mad now, Like he is actually mad, He is gonna go on a god damn rampage.
Pedro
Whoever made this trailer needs a raise. Everything about this movie seems so real. The mob hunting him down, the original 1970s actors coming together, and the look in the fireman's eyes at 1:53 and his scream.
I like the nod to Halloween III. I kind of want a remake of that, but not really.
Why don’t  they ever make sure he’s dead?
They really did a good job not revealing the whole movie
Thank you for showing us every killing - now there’s no point in watching the movie.
Superr excited
Wow, just WOW! This movie is so tired already.....sheesh ;(
At this point just lure him away and nuke him
any halloween movie after the 2nd one is basically Fan Fiction
Jamie Lee Curtis is amazing actress. Watching trailer gave me chills.
Picture the scene: Michael has finally been cornered by the whole town in the town square.  Sherrif: "not tonight, you sick f*ck." JLC: "you're finished. Its over for you." Myers: *coughs* "well youve certainly got me on the ropes..." Everyone: *shocked that Myers just spoke.* Myers: "its a good thing I brought a little backup."  *Avengers Theme starts playing.*  A large machete bursts out of a wall and skewers a townsman, as Jason Voorhees steps forward menacingly.  Several townspeople begin floating into the sky, into the gaping maw of Pennywise.  Townspeople begin to run, but are cut down at the ankles by a tag team of Chucky, Chucky's Bride and Annabelle, who begin to evicerate them.  Park Benches begin to whirl into heads and faces begin to sluff off as the Poltergeist from Poltergeist lets loose.  As people are knocked unconscious by the debris, they are confronted in thier coma dreams by Freddy Kreuger, who begins to enact all kinds of tortures.  The square becomes a killzone of horrific traps and we cut to Jigsaw looking at the scene through CCTV cameras.  The Avengers music crescendos as our team coalesces, to stand before the carnage they have wrought on the town. The remaining townspeople are petrified.  Michael: *whispers* "this is the part, where you run away."  The town flees and the group scatters to continue preying upon them.
This franchise needs to end just like fast and furious.
this movie? the best
Jamie Lee Curtis when Michael Myers survives death for the 16th time in a row: "Ah shit here we go again"
This looks epic
God I hope they listen to MatPat. Irradiate the guy already!!!
What I never understood was Michael really only comes after his family members on Halloween. So why would you not just leave Haddonfield every Halloween? Just get on a plane and fly to another state across the country
Thanks for showing us the entire movie you hack marketing department
The visuals behind him sucks? But in front of him rule. Too sick
I am going to have a meltdown if Michael survives once again. What does it take to kill just one guy?
Me imagino si hubieran usado la música de Ghost (Hunters Moon ) para el trailer...
I'm so excited to watch this movie, Does anyone know when will this movie release?
These movies never get old to me lol
im hyped for this movie
You really have to commend the makeup artists for making Jamie Lee Curtis look so old and decrepit 1:20
Cannot Wait!
The firemen in the firetruck going to the burning house: "its going to be a simple house fire, just put it out and everyone will be happy" - THe firemen seeing Michael Fucking Myers walk out of the burning house without a single scratch on him: "Never mind we are not going to put out the fire and instead we are going to ru- *dies*
I'm 38 years old and he won't die I'm going to be 70 and he still going to be out there killing people
The way Michael moves, I bet it’s funny when he takes a shit lol
"I'm coming for you, Michael  It's been 43 years just kill him already
They're making him some kind of god?
I was gonna forward this on to people to get them hype but lads... Too much shown... Relax. Still looks great like, but I actually don't want to forward this to anybody I care about.
The original opening trailer for the 1978 movie is here!! https://youtu.be/W-mh2eJu9-w
He can’t beat goku though
Michael does always stay safe by wearing a mask :)
I met him, 15 years ago; I was told there was nothing left; no reason, no conscience, no understanding in even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this... six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and... the blackest eyes - the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up, because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.
the hair of the white mask gets more and more clean cut with each new Halloween that comes out in theatres. Killing in style!
Samurai sword the arms off. That would be too easy though. Movie would be over with a armless killer with no way to carry out his serial killing spree. Also, i am curious if the fingers from the Left hand are missing. Lori blew them off with the shot guns. I love watching for little details like that to see if there is 100% carryover from the 1st movie.
I'm so excited 🎃
Tall white guys be like
Rewatched all the halloween movies from the 2007 one to 2018 now im just waiting for this one until next friday. cant wait
I felt like I watched the whole movie after watching the trailer 😂
I always laugh when I hear there’s another one coming out but Jesus this looks good 😂
I am in October 6
How tf this man is still alive
No need to watch the movie now, seen it all in this trailer. Good job.
Michael Myers versus the whole town of Haddonfield? I'd say the odds are about even.
Beautiful
Why can't you use Death Note? Just a simple writing and done.
Michael is one man to be holding a decades long grudge
It looks pretty good. I wish they'd also bring back Friday the 13th. Jason Vorhees had the best/funniest ways of killing mass amounts of people. Those movies were great. That fucker got so creative with kills. I still remember in #2 (possibly) a female getting trapped in a yellow sleeping bag that looked like a banana and Vorhees dragged her to a tree and swing it like a bat against a tree lol!   I can't think of any other comedy/horror series that made me laugh hysterically thru all the sequels.
Poor bastards... should have used "Dead Hard" Laurie has the right idea, she used "Decisive Strike"
Michael Myers Isin't a guy to mess with
Laurie did all that preparation and just leaves the house instead of making sure Michael was finally dead. Lame
He’s Like 70ish Now. A Geriatric Killer. Let It GO.
I thought it was joe Biden
OMG Michael is killing black people this is a racist movie 😂🤣
Jamie cut Michael’s head off in h20 so this is nuts
The greatest of all time. Michael Meyers
I love the new score. Very modern
I can’t wait to see this one ☝️hope it as good as it looks
Look awesome 🎃🎃🎃
I AM FUCKING HYPED. Is it weird that I’m on Micheal Myers team and not the victims during the movies ?. Hahaha
The violin is spot on, i gotta say
Michael Myers never die
no one can kill Michael myers
Halloween Kills - Laurie will think she’s a gangsta try shoot Micheal miss and Micheal throws her to the floor and stamps her face out boom game over and everyone else turns into pussies and watches her die
Can't waitttt
Why?  Why do they continue to drag this out?  We get it he doesn't die.  Same thing just over and over again.  First Halloween great, Rob zombie Halloween great......the rest is like beating a dead horse.  Enough!!!
Wouldn’t Michael Myers be like 75 now?
To be fair every 1 this could be the Halloween film ever looks unreal thumbs up I’f you argree 👍
you cant kill something thats allready dead.
There gunna have to bring in the avengers at this point to stop him
I love Jason, wow so cool very amazing
So excited!!!
Michael Myers vs the whole town
What is he transcending to
Jamie Lee Curtis is an angel to agree to still star in these movies after all these decades. One of the reasons why I'll continue to watch every single one.
The Halloween III Season of The Witch masks???? PURE FUCKING GENIUS......
Michael Myers wears a mask...and  he's still alive....Be like like, and wear your mask....
Damn SWF always sending killers to Haddonfield smh
10 days !!!!
Everything is repeated everyday this makes me sick nothing new
As long as Micheal has survived in a mask, we might not get out of ours… lol (fun intent) I love the Haddonfield Halloween movies
I thought Jamie was killed.
So stupid
He’s not going to die
"No No No. Let it burn!!!" "Yes Yes Yes. Job town baby!!!!!!!
Nothin' like giving away the whole plot in the trailer, eh? Genuinely looks entertaining, all the same. The soundtrack is fucking stellar, even from this snippet.
Just in time for Halloween. Can’t wait to see it
I was wondering how he survived the fire without any burns, then I finally picked up on the fact he got into the gun cabinet and closed the metal door to protect himself from most of the blaze.
This look like this will be best one after the original of course
I love that they show the masks from Halloween 3!
When is this coming out?
is that Kyle from real housewives at the 2 min mark?
Bruh you can’t kill Michael what’s the point 😂
When is that foo gon die 😭😂
Im Hyped….!
Looks like three victims at the playground are wearing masks from "Halloween 3- Season of the Witch" that capitalized on the popularity but had nothing to do with the original characters.   How fitting.
Shite
I just hate how the firefighters died. They're just tryna put the fire out 1:32 fun fact these were the masks in Halloween 3 season of the witch the best Halloween in my opinion and it dosen't even have MM in it
I like Bruce Dern!
I would say "Do it!" myself, though.
The problem with the reboot are the death scenes. Halloween (1978) and the 1981 sequel were scary because the storyline flowed like mercury. Now when anything happens it is an event.
Unless she is purposely made up to look that old, Jamie Lee Curtis looks 80!
There's sequels prequels and remakes when will it stop the original is good as it is
The hunter becomes the hunted
The last one sucked , sorry ! I’m not holding my breath on this one . The original is the best , PERIOD!
Pritty cool got hodder playing 2 parts
I don't see the movie ??
That nigga got stronger shit Michael they really done pissed you off
Omg I don't believe this will happen next in this movie it's really fucking damn twist 😲😱🤯
I Love ROB Zombie's 2 depictions of Halloween. Those 2 movies were BadAss!!
Michael Myers has been chasing Jamie Lee Curtis for 40 years. This took stalker to a whole new level.
Micheal Myers is literally kenny
Just run loops on him, you'll be good.
That was a Stihl ts420 nice saw
0:33 okay but why did I just fall in love with those eyes??
Season 7 Warning Attack
Women again ??? Can't old women and young girls beat Michael Myers, no need to shove them everywhere, don't bury the Halloween franchise !!!
So after all these years he’s still going for Laurie’s coochie. What a lad. Can’t she catch a break?
I hope Michael tears all those stupid screaming bitches apart!!!!!!
Awesomeness!!! Yes!!!!!!💯💯💯💯💯💯
Should've bring spine chill this time, damn.
I didn't want to see it, but moment i learned that GHOST did song for this song it got more interesting.
Him walking out the house with the fire is fucking badass
Michael is to raw with his killing 😂😂💯
My prediction. A cash grab just like the last terminator movie. They bring the old cast back for nostalgic reasons. They play it during the month of halloween. This pattern looks all too familiar.
I came
oh man this looks wicked..  🔥
I want Michael Myers to murder everyone one till there's no one left

And just like the trailer for the first movie, they show most if not all the killings.   No genuine surprises when you watch the actual movie.
If this was in modern today times micheal would’ve been taken down quite easily realistically.
I’m coming for you Michael. That’s what she said
I enjoy watching Michael kill , Watching all the Halloween’s this month
I’m back! 🔪
Man first one was so awesome with references they better keep good continuity Micheal only got three fingers left on one hand no one else remember😤 But honestly the violin Halloweena theme 😏👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Bring back jason
Was there anyone that they didn’t show how they were killed?
Mike be having me look at my own brother like “You Better Not Even Try It”
It's a Hunter's Moon 🌕🏹
Looks Great Getting Better Better 🇬🇧😍👍👌
i just want a movie where he goes full darth vader hallway and just MESSES THINGS UP
"The Camp Blood" will know (as it will become known) worldwide, it will be the massacre (by Übermensch and Estelar Ombudsman) of the children(heirs) and grandchildren(successors) of the Satanists of the global elite , on their properties (national and state parks), which will trigger the Third World War (The Armageddon).   (Isaiah 32:9-14; Isaiah 33:1-9)
ESTE MES ESTE MES SE ESTRENA POR FIN!!!!
This is gonna be epic. Love how fierce jamie let Curtis is in this movie
They should be doing Michael musical 🎼 🙄
This fool is like Jason now.
0:44 damn……a buzzsaw to the face
Shouldn't Michael be in his 70s now? What? Do they think we're stupid are something?
I like how the most liked comments are just quotes taken from the trailer.. real original 😂
Can't wait to get high and go watch this !
This dude can't dide we need more movies like this 😩
Finally 11 days left to see the shape unmasked if they will show his face to us
Omg when will he die
Oooooooooof that's just a big fat Oooooooooof
Dr. Loomis: "The tribe. One of their number was butchered. This is a wake!"
Looks pretty bada$$
They say Tom Brady is the GOAT.  They say Michael Jordan is the GOAT.  And on and on and on...NOPE...Michael Myers is the TRUE GOAT!
Micheal Myers is a fictional character like The Stig..!
The pumpkin on the head is a reference to Halloween 3, which michael myers wasn't wasn't in
Bro, why am I only getting this I my recommended now???????
Anyone else notice the Halloween masks from Silver Shamrock?
2:20 survivors bullying the killer in DBD.
If halloween cast only knew that the only counter for perma tombstone Myers is a locker not a shotgun, they would've live.  Karen tried to use decisive strike on herself, grandma didn't taught her well. Many mistakes were made, yet is Myers to blame.  Amateurs.
I fucking can't wait for this
its that time again🎃
💙💙
The whole town's gonna be dead by the end of this film. . .and Michael's just gonna walk away from it as always.
i have a couple of swammies and whoppers with a few addresses in the projects   i triple dog dare Michael Myers, to come through
There is octuber month 🔥
Myers got that unlimited tier 3 going on  Dbd players get me 😂😂😂
Stupid ass fire fighters thats what they get. they should have let him burn
Michael Myers return
This is gonna be a good one
I know....evil dies tonight.....so did they start filming the next Halloween movie yet? 😂😂😂😂😂
Since 1978 Michael Myers has been terrifying this neighborhood
Michael Myers ain't playing WIIIITTTCCCHH! MICHAEL saying, ok, come get me Bitches! You've been trying for decades! Oh he acting up in this. Jamie is the Queen of Horror!!!!
I am excited like a teen. Definitely gonna get me into the movies for this. Looks dang good if I must say.
She’s coming for you Michael
When did Michael start levitating? He practically flew to the top of the suv with Marion , the nurse and the doctor oblivious inside
Laurie Strode's inspirational speech . . .  Halloween will no longer be known as an American holiday! But as the day when Haddonfield declared in one voice  - we will not go quietly into the night! We will not vanish without a fight! We're gonna survive! We're gonna live on! Tonight - we celebrate - Halloween!
So basically its Myers vs the entire town lmao. At this rate and his age, he will soon be killing people in the Haddonfield nursing home😂 Ole dude is always up to his old tricks.. Gotta love him.
You would think that at some point since 1978, Laurie Stroud would have moved as far away from Haddonfield as possible -  like Australia.  I just can't see MM getting past airport security with the mask.
I actually like this movie more then the others
How many fucking Halloween movies do they want to make ffs 🤦‍♂️
This land is your land and this land is my land From California to the New York island From the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters This land was made for you and me As I went walking that ribbon of highway I saw above me that endless skyway Saw below me that golden valley This land was made for you and me I roamed and rambled and I've followed my footsteps To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts All around me a voice was sounding This land was made for you and me When the sun come shining, then I was strolling And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling The voice was chanting as the fog was lifting This land was made for you and me This land is your land and this land is my land From California to the New York island From the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters This land was made for you and me When the sun come shining, then I was strolling And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling The voice come a-chanting and the fog was lifting This land was made for you and me 🎶
Dammit ! Who else watched this epic Trailer about 50 times?! I wanna finally see it!  Evil will win this night! >:-D
Streaming on peacock
Greetings you fabulous Earthlings and Happy Sunday!! 👋👽I bring thin crust Covid 19 pizza to all you friendly Earthlings 🍕Don't mind me, just cruising by:::::::::::::::::🛸
How is this guy so strong
What ever happened to Laurie's son from h20
Old age is the only thing going to kill Myers.
Nobody be talking about how they using a violin for the main theme. Chills
.... long lasting franchise.... even surviving f....ing corona! Still gotta watch it though....
Omg stop it already.  Last one was dumb and unintentionally funny and this one will be, too.
For them to show so many kills in the trailer, I imagine the body count is going to be high as fuck.
If Michael Meyers wants to be top killer with in the next two movies he needs 37 kills. Can he do it? Jason is champ atm
They can't even handle a slowpoke heavy old man. There are million ways to kill him and end the movie in 1 minute no need to drag it that long.
Didn't his head get chopped of in one of the previous movies ..h20 I think it was
Don’t fear the reaper 💯
The icy polish historically sigh because math phenotypically tow amongst a acidic macaroni. wide-eyed, shocking handle
Hold up; I know he didn't kill those kids..🤪
Comcast universal and Miramax? wow!
I'm almost 50 and this still is CREEPY AF to ME!  LMAO!!
Evil dies tonight!.. until movie producers want to milk it again next year this time.
ALL ABORD THE HYPE TRAIN!!!!!!!
I'm so watching  this!🙋🏿💝💝💝💘🔥😈😈🔥😈😈🌈❤
You want your mask back come out here and get it…  Michael: to himself after seeing the whole town outside his house “BET”

last flim and the slashers are gone
I've seen this rn and really like the part where the The people are hiding.
Isn’t in a non covid world this supposed to be the release of Halloween Ends??? Covid really put a bummer on that
The only thing I didn’t think I’d like about this was how Michael survives the fire but from the looks of it they nailed it
This is Stephen king's The Outsider? why copy?
they take his mask off and he have mike myers face and start doin an austin power powers impression "oh behave, yeah baby yeah!"
Love the idea of the whole town going after Michael. It gives a sort of old school monster movie vibe with the villagers forming an angry mob to hunt down the monster.
I love how there's so much more death in this one. Michael's on a rampage
What happened to her son? In that one movie she had a son- now it's a daughter?  Give me a break- and yeah she's been saying the same lines for 40 years.
No matter how strong you are, plot convenience is always on michaels side
What if Michael was actually the good guy. What if, as a child, he was given a vision that one of his sisters decendents would be the antichrist or something and so he killed his sister. Then he hunted down his other sister realising it was her all along. That's good motivation right there
ik this movie finna be fire🦾🥶
I never even considered jumping him before lmao yasssss get him!
Do we really need another Halloween movie. This movie looks so dumb
Ohhhh boody man such bad acting-
Movie looks awesome but, this doesn’t feel right without Donald Pleasence. Aka, Dr. Loomis!! Rip to one the greats of this franchise🤞🏼
There is no doubt this mob is going to kill the wrong guy thinking it is Michael
I've seen all the death scene
I love the rework of the theme! It’s so much creepier.
I would say that him taking out an entire brigade of fire fighters is jumping the shark, but we passed that point a long time ago
Death has come to your town sheriff
The first and second Halloween films were 1978 and 1981, though it's a continuity of the same night, Halloween and Halloween Kills is 2018 and 2021, and a continuity of the same night.
I can’t wait till October 15th me and my twin brother seeing this movie in the theater
My 10yr old daughter has been watching Michael since she was 2 and never once terrified. She loves him and watched Halloween year round. Every movie. She could tell you everything and all characters. She is so flipping excited about this. 🙌🏽 bring it on!
Why didn't yall just call this halloween again? No need to put any words after halloween, just keep calling it halloween.
Please stop making these Universal. You're just diluting, what was ONCE an amazing character and story. Try making something original instead of mutilating something that WAS original. How many times do you have to "re-imagine" things before you realize you always make them worse? I think you have ruined ENOUGH!

It's gonna be a really terrible movie if its just a splatter fest. That's why Rob Zombies movie bombed so badly. It's NOT why the original was or is popular. If anything it was the opposite. It was the lack of blood in the original and the intense suspense. If they brought back all of these wonderful actors like Nancy Stephens, Kyle Richard and Charles Cyphers just to kill them it's gonna be a pretty boring lame film.
I never thought it would be possible to make a Halloween movie as good as the original. But Halloween Kills did that with ease! What an amazing film!
Fuck yeah Halloween
Honestly, I have serious doubts about this movie.  Mostly, it's the constant blood I'm seeing. That was one of H2's mistakes.  Also, Michael isn't Freddy or Jason. Michael was originally about getting to his target or killing those that got in his way. In this trailer it just seems to just be about upping the body count as much as possible. Michael is suppose to be stealthily moving through the shadows. That's what does, but this trailer.....it's really in your face.
I love all the cool callbacks to the originals...but i never really understood "Season Of The Witch", are those the same masks from that movie??(pumpkin,skull, & witch head)
Why Michael Myers always survive? Then what next ... Hallowen Kills 2 Hallowen Kills 3 Hallowen Infinity Kills Hallowen Endgame
Ok, the first 50 seconds are waaay to ridicilous even for a Halloween movie
mike is the goat love this man
This ìs Remakesequel
Bill Shatner's on the loose again!
Halloween & The Exorcist…first notes of the theme music has me turning on all the lights and keeping a clear path to the front door.
Im suprised nobody talked about the masks from 3.
Am a Fan And I Can't WAIT!!!!!!...🔪
Ok i speak for a decent amount of us with asking i all honesty please tell us how many times are we going to kill this guy i mean come on. This is starting to get kinda old. Please Hollywood please come up with something else. I mean how about you guy do a  remake of the creature of the black lagoon. Or how about you take one of the old Godzilla movies like Godzilla vs gamera the space turtle or one of the kigos we have seen him go up after in the other 1980 classics
This film looks great but I have a massive problem with the trailer. I feel like I’ve basically seen the film. Beginning, most kills, and pretty much the end
"DO ITT" Allyson is killing it at 2:17 ! The brand new scream queen in the making ! 🔥🔥 Pumped up as hell for this upcoming Halloween
If they do a face reveal, I'll be pissed!!
uyy ya quiero ver el te lo resumo haber cuanto le sube el contador
"Evil dies tonight!" That's the neat part...it won't, cause we already know there's an announced sequel after Kills
1:40 I don't know why but Lonnie and Tommy working together to bring down Michael has me even more excited.
Hes been running after her fo 43 years now and never got her  Next year is the LAST halloween with Jamie Lee Curtis
''I met him, 15 years ago; I was told there was nothing left; no reason, no conscience, no understanding in even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this... six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and... the blackest eyes - the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up, because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.''
So it’s the whole damn town vs micheal Myers, I bet my money on the guy that LITTERY can’t die and has super strength , ability to hunt down anyone… I’m moving from that town to south africa
🎶 It's a Hunter's Moon 🎶
cannot wait for this shit!!😂
♡
This is gonna be one hell of a scary movie
THIS IDEA IS FUCKING AWESOME AS HUGE FUN HALLOWEN SAY LET HUNT BEGIN 31 OCTOBER  DR LOOMIS
be interesting haddonfield order ms myers start hunt michael sdie many people 31 BESS RING HUTERS MOON UP BOOGEYMAN REAL KILL KILL YOU GOING CINEMA LET WILD GON BEGIN  MICHAEL COME TO SIS XOXO
Plot twist: Jaimie joins her brother on a killing spree.
If they really want to kill Michael Myers they should hire whoever wrote The Love Guru.  He ended things for Mike Myers, maybe he could end things for Michael Myers too.  If that doesn't work, send Jason after him.
Does anyone know that after Halloween kills in 2022 there is going to be the final Halloween movie called Halloween ends. How sad does that sound it's been 40 years michael myers movies are going to end then.😭😢😭😭😭
Jeez these new trailers spoil the whole movie.
Wonder whats the ending and Michael Myers face is I don't know and we will see his face.
I like that they made this a sequel to the 1978 movie and disregarding all the other movies. That’s how it should be
She needs to move to Hawaii then there's no way he can reach her unless he flies which we know he can't do
"Michael Myers is flesh and blood." Didn't he take 6 shots in the chest in the first movie?
he will still have gamemode 1 in the next movie
Wishing you well Michael
Show the same thing all the time repeatedly 🤦‍♂️ people just hype bs up with foolishness…
*_It's a hunter's mooon_*
GHOST. HUNTERS ⚫....fuckn brilliant
Why did Ghost have to release a new song for me to find about this ? This film is gonna rock
This is technically Halloween 2
Everyone gangsta till Michael chugs the Fire res potion.
Just more sub par writing and lots of gore. People are easy to please these days. Just like everyone flocked on Godzilla vs Kong now nobody even cares.
I am here because of Tobias Forge.
next year he's still alive and they do this shit over again
"Rip And Tear... Until It Is Done"
Hate how they’re showing creative kills early kinda ruins the scare later
I’m just glad that they are pushing the lore of Halloween further and including Jamie lee Curtis is a perfect way to do that
This is awesome
This movie is going to make bank I haven’t gone to the movies yet since the pandemic other than candy man but I’m going to see venom Friday then the 22nd I’m going to see Halloween I’m super excited
Ghost, from Halloween Kills
Sucks to see they're throwing out everything that made the first reboot (and the original) any good whatsoever and turning it into another terrible Friday the 13th clone. Oh well, 1 out of 2 isn't bad for current Hollywood
At 0:34, when he's coming out on the Front Porch, and he has the Crowbar in his hands,  It looks like He's Coming Out To WHIP SOME ASS!!!  Also in that part of the trailer, but maybe even in the whole trailer...  But especially that part they should've played "Rock You Like A Hurricane" By Scorpion!
Wow
😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😫😫😫😫😫😟😟😟😟
What do we do one person replies we go to camp crystal lake and bring someone named Jason to do the job
What the F did the FFighters do ? Just trying to out that 2 alarm .
2:12 the music that starts playing like the synth theme what is it called
Amoo Halloweennn
His mask miraculously survives a house fire. Hahahaha.Must be Jesus in da flesh
I lover that this movie carries on directly after the last one. So uncommon for movies these days! And even better for those who haven't followed the whole Halloween series.... I still remember watching H20 for the first time, I didn't sleep without the light on in my room for a whole week!
Laurie: Evil Dies tonight                   Myers:  I'm sorry I really don't feel like coming back to work even your extra $500 to come back still isn't worth it and I'm not agreeing with your vaccine mandate either.

Well thanks for giving away the whole movie in the trailer!  No need to see it now.  Why do they do this?  I can't tell you how many movies are spoiled because some studios feel the need to show you every good scene in the movie to sell tickets.
I'm waiting for her to drop the pallet and teabag Michael.
I just don’t know how tf he survived the fire
Sneaked in the theatre to see the first one bc we weren’t of age.
And it always leads to his childhood home. What the hell happened there????
The mask The breathing The music The 70s my first one Can’t wait
Laurie's ''LET HIM BURN!'' gave me chills.     I'm so ready for this trilogy.
Yeeeeeeeeeee Michael Timeless
Anyone else caught the Easter egg of the Halloween 3 masks?
Showing the kills in the trailer though....pretty weak
I can’t wait to see this movie
he's running iridescent hair, cause thats a long tier 3
Halloween part 88,  when does it end?
I don’t care how many Halloween movies they make. Halloween is my favorite movie franchise of all time, and they can gladly take my money lol (except for that weird witch one with the masks, hated that one)
😍
That nod to Halloween III was tight!
Are you kidding me LOL?
Yea
Evil dies
"It's time to kill Michael once and for all."  Is that even possible?
Michael is the best serial killer movie film and with and with Jamie Lee Curtis  males the movie is Best .
“Evil dies tonight”  Dude you’ve been saying that for like 45 years
Movie looks good but this trailer is crap.
Micheal : *dieing is gay*
literally cant wait for this
This is going to be a really great movie this year
I just watched Halloween for the first time last night looks like I picked the perfect time to get into it
Michael he T800 terminator, what? Oh.. you dasent know about that?
This looks promising unlike the candyman movie which is a shambles
Welcome to the kill count, where we tally up the victims in all of our favorite horror movies...
They should let Michael kill Jamie Lee Curtis finally and at the end of the film (after the credits) she wakes up in her bed and it was all a dream.  Call the next Halloween - Halloween - Rebirth
Now I'm not going to lie, this actually looks pretty good. I know the more sequels Hollywood makes the worse they get, but this actually looks good
What is it the crowd's chanting?
I feel sad for the firemen, they didn’t stand a chance.
The firemen watching Michael emerge from the house is just epic, like people seeing a demon crawl out from the pits of hell 🌚
@lildurk Chicago Illinois
Don't get scared but I'm The Voice Steven is #TheVoice I'm @Lildurk happy birthday
That violin is hitting tho!
“No no no no let it burn”
Is this part 2 of the Danny Mcbride film or does this fall into the H20 timeline?

wow. Michael Myers looks pretty spry for a 64 year old.
Should've titled it "Evil Dies Tonight: the 3rd attempt"
No one can touch him just the grandma. 🤦.
I think this is it
They should of put rob zombie his films were way better
Do you guys think Michael showers
i have never seen some so dedicated to killing his sister like what will he do after that?
This looks awesome but I never understand why they show so many kills during horror movie trailers it really takes the thrill out of it lol
Just drop a pallet on him
That fireman that attacked Michael with the buzzsaw instead of running is an ultimate Chad
Go woke, go broke. Bet this movie will flop.
Best horror movies of all time IMO !!! Michael has scared me since the 80’s
Please end this franchise- for the love of God
I love these movies and I get that he’s so unkillable, but I think it’s getting close to the end of this story
It’s funny that the world, movie wise, doesn’t know who Micheal is. Call up the national guard or something. Cause at this point, the town officers ain’t cutting it. Hell make sure to put an iPhone in his pocket. Someone has to be bait lol and get his ass. If that’s really him anyway 🤣🤣🤣 40 damn years‼️
They practically axed off half their cast, pretty soon I’M going to have to be in a Halloween movie. 😋🎃
WHERE IS BRIAN ANDREWS !! HE said he wanted to come back!! Why bring back everyone but him??
Going to watch this on the 16th of October in harkins theater in Oklahoma city I can't wait ONFONEM this movie gonna be LITT gone have pizza when I watch it & bringing my horror jacket & my Michael Myers chain with me when watching the movie on dat day. LLVROY
I think they are reviving Micheal just for the money like I mean Micheal feels post mortal to me
The lady dies
So does Michael come out as a pansexual or some other bs in this movie
...house burning down of fire...  Firemen : "yo Michael, it's me, ya boi..."
Send a drone then😆
GU GU GU GHAY!
Ooooh, this is gonna be gooood!!!!
Michel was cursed that’s why he immortal
Whose been cutting michaels hair . Or is the mask powerful 🤔
Micheal never dies....
Michael is that one guy in the team when everyone dies and their the only ones alive they suddenly go to god mode
The teen pulling on the car door handle to the beat was sick
This is the most goodest Halloween ever
You know imma make my family go and watch this movie in theaters
Can they PLEASE stop spoiling all the kills/money shots in the damn trailer??
My favorite part from the trailer yet.is the kids going "Theres a man in a white mask playing hide and seek with us" and hes standing by the car
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Stop ruining a decent franchise
Το περιμενουμε με αγωνια γιατι αυτη η ιστορια πρεπει να τελειωνη καποια στιγμη τοσα χρονια τους ξεφευγει ας ελπισουμε οτι η αδελφη του θα τον αποτελειωση!!!!!!.
Just leave Michael dead alreadyyy🤣😂
There making 1 more after this
Michael Myers: The essence of evil.
I'm coming for you Michael 🗡
Best movie serial killer
Unpopular opinion, every Halloween movie except the first one sucks, stop watch this garbage people, Halloween 1978 was meant to be a stand alone classic, leave it at that.
I am laughing my ass off right now, the amount of trashtalk they gave the Halloween sequels for making Michael supernatural, and now look where we are!
Plot twist, Michael Myers is an evil version of deadpool. (joke)
Jamie Lee Curtis will be 90 and still runnin away from micheal
That sounds like music from the Witcher
Dis finna be da best Halloween nokap 😈🐐 betta then da first one
I can’t wait till it comes out so I can watch it with my sisters on sisters night out
So by basic Google search, this won’t be the end either. They split the end into two new movies, this and then there will be Halloween ends. I’m still crying at the fact that they really had me fooled last time into thinking it was the end but I’m so excited to see how this and the next play out.
I like the Halloween 3 Easter egg in this trailer.
Ughhh, I’m so ready for this!
I'm calling it now, the final twist in Halloween Ends will be that Michael with the mask is the boogeyman, and only when his mask is removed (or maybe destroyed) can Michael Myers the man be killed.
bro i feel like they showed too much, i feel like i just watched the entire movie lmao
That leg 🦵 break 🥴🥴🥴
Me actually here liking the comments.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I'm still confused how Michael still manages to kill people with his asthma.
Three words are all I need to know to see this movie “EVIL DIES TONIGHT!!” The beginning of the end of Michael Myers, for all time
way he kills that lady with the candle stick, dammmn
i can’t believe this movie is still going
🙄
I bet you that's is happened on the opening scene with those firefighters going to Laurie's house and then michael will come out to kill them
why dont they make in in 3 D like Bloody Valentines and Friday the 13 th ????
I bet someone in America has already shot or brutally stabbed someone death that stole there Halloween mask
I want to see how they want to fight when they already tryed to kill him like 1 million times and they are still trying /:
Laurie uses Decisive Strike! It's super effective!!?
Micheal Myers: "I can do this all day."

Can’t wait to see this movie. Love the series
I've tried looking for the Myers sound at 2:10, but can't seem to find the right one! I need help lol i just think it's the scariest noise ever
How the fuck did Michael escape the fire he is a savage can't wait for Halloween 5aka kills
wow fireman been defeated by a old man. i bet michael myers is getting sick of being in those movies and begs em to let him rest in peace almost like jason rip friday the 13th
Aqui no Brasil Todo Mundo Ja eufórico aguardando o Lançamento !! Vou assistir mais de uma vez no cinema!! Queremos Michel e Laurie com seu Duelo !  veem Michael🎃👏👏👏 # HalloweenKills #H43
I swear if they end this one and finally close it out with Jamie Lee Curtis finally actually killing Michael Myers, because the studio wants to promote some empowered women woke BS, I'll friken throw a back of rotten dog crap on the dang screen!
COOL !!
the fact that 6 or 8 firemam with wepons could not even take him he is on a new level
The mashup!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBj6UE8G-e8
<unstoppable monster>      Then why even try ?
Before you see Halloween Kills, you need to go back to the beggining, 1978 HALLOWEEN! only then will you understand HALLOWEEN AND MICHEAL MYERS! YOU CANT KILL EVIL!
This is gonna be 🔥🔥🔥
2:23 when he's late on child support by 1 day.

Helll yees
1:45 onward is just straight goosebumps
Omg😍😍😍😍
You know... this has turn into less horror. But changed it into something epic.  Which feels all sorts of wrong but all sorts of right.
The ultimate horror is almost here. Don't really understand, how this doesn't have more views. Candyman has over 26 million views, despite sucking and failing so badly.. 🔪🎃 Michael makes up for that with his insane bodycount.
Firefighter: grab my hand  Michael: ok.
i dont like it..
I love how he never dies
Spoiler Alert. He dsnt Die. He never does
I think it’s time to get a shotgun bolt
I know I sound dumb but hire the army or something-It’s the first thing that came to my mind
I'm penning a script to have a Michael vs Jason, where Michael is the one who pushes Jason in the lake, and it ends with season 1 with the reveal that Laurie was the councillor, and it has a profile shit of the legendary fuckers side by side, face to face, then they turn and look at the camera
You know by comparison to most real life True Crime story murderers.. Micheal Myers isn't actually that much worst... Sad but True.. 🎃
This looks bad.. the title alone is worth skipping… The best of all was the original Halloween from 1978.. Halloween 2 was decent.. then all the others just got dumber..
Going to be AWESOME  !!!!!
Omg yess
He kills the people who tried to save him. What a dickhead
Michale Myers is the GOAT!🐐
Jamie Lee Curtis looking like she has seen Halloween come and go about 90 times in this one.
Does Michael Myres die in this movie cause I don’t think this guy can die?
Wait so Micheal is an action hero now?
I hope he finally speaks
When they are on first name basis! ✨👌🏼 2:24

OMG 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯 that look like the best halloween i so cann't wait
The story of an innocent man who despite wearing a mask, is unable to prove he has been double vaccinated and is hunted down by the town for not isolating
They show almost the whole movie
I can’t wait for this film
Who would have known this is the last Michael Myers movie?
This is 1 of my favorite movies, but will this this time be the last?
hey Laurie. listen i feel like this video might be helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWB3VhIPWrU just saying, your in a hospital. the key component is there, you got a lot of people on your side. you literally got nothing else to lose
superhero
the music is a bop
Can’t believe he killed the fire fighters
Halloween 3 masks? Is this gonna have all the previous survivors?

I'm definitely watching this
This looks dam good
Rob zombie made this movie, better than it ever could be.
Can't wait for this one!
Another sequel... lmao
I can’t get enough of Micheal Myers!! 🎃🎃
Did anyone else notice that the masks the victim family had on looked eerily similar to the Halloween 3 masks?
Oh man I'm turning 32 tomorrow i really love watching Halloween movies since my high school days i watched every Halloween movie and i once saw Michael's mask in bride of chucky i really whant to see a Michael Myers vs Jason movie since high school and I really wanna see a Michael Myers vs chucky movie
The hunter becomes the hunted.
he’s backkkkkk
When did they start showing the entire movie during the trailer...?
Imma need them to kill Michael Official now or kill Laurie official and don’t bring her back! I love the series but it’s redundant now. Think of a new 2021’s slasher killer
How tf did he get up and destroy those firemen after inhaling all that smoke from the fire?!?! that mf should be coughing his balls up
THEY WERE SO CLOSE. Why go to the trouble of casting everyone from the original and then leave out Brian Andrews as Tommy Doyle or Brent Lee Page as Lonnie Lamb? Lonnie I understand as it's a minor character but I saw an interview where Andrews expressed interest in returning.
Halloween ends next year. That is probably gonna be an epic movie. I’m calling it now.
1000+ ppl vs 1 Scary Man(Who wins?)
Aaahhh naaah not the black folks its 2021 not the 80s  Daaaamn it!!!!!!!
Come on, I can see Michael surviving the fire, but his clothes and mask wouldn't.
Damn this man just never dies 😭😭
LETSSSSSSSS GOOOOOOO
The Trailer tells everything.
as a firefighter.. this trailer unlocked a new fear…..
How old is Michael? 61? 👀
This franchise is dead. Why does it ignore all of the other films like they didn't happen.🙄😒😴
HELL YESSS
Damn that firefighter scene is amazing
In the previous instalment, Laurie sliced off two of Michael's fingers and thumb from his right hand. And in the time it took for the fire fighters to arrive, he's grown them back?!
ISNT THE MUSIC  FROM THE END BO2 ZOMBIES MUSIC
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Laurie Stroud: "We have to stop this murderous madman!"  Michael Myers: "Hold my beer"
Michael is very scared of a 62 year old lady.  Real scared.
0:14 “LET IT *BUUURN!!* “  Oh Jamie you haven’t lost a damn step.
UNIVERSAL GANG
Hot take : Why don’t movie makers create  new movie ideas  instead of using old ones and then actually making them worst.
Hasnt he been "killed" like 40 times??

This dude has been stabbed, hit by a car, shot, set on fire and blown up, he can lift people with ease, smash their head with his bare hands sneaks around and vanishes on some batman shit.. He ain’t a man he a fuckin deity.
They should’ve let it burn 🔥😣
YAYYYYYYYYYY
This trailer is amazing
Cant wait
Even Kyle Richards is here 😱
My beverlly hills queen kyle, cant wait
Holy shit that looks awesome.
Dead Meat is going to have a field day with this one
Killin firemen is not cool at all mike. Stick to the knuckle head teens dang.
Where is the edge of your seat suspense the first Halloween had, this is pure gratuitous predictable violence. Lazy writing.
IM SO HYPE FOR THIS. Halloween is my favorite franchise. I never get tired of Michael Meyers 51/50 ass. Also seeing Cheryl/Carol/Cherlene in a serious role is strange.
It's going to take some serious self control to not watch Dead Meats Kill Count before I watch this movie.
Here before he kills all of us.
Micheal literally is badass
Michael Myers vs. The whole freakin town…my money is on “the big guy”! And I don’t mean Biden😉
All he wanted to do was go home after a long day of murdering everyone.
Is it the fact that Michael never says a word that makes him so scary, or is it just me?
I hope they don’t mess this up. And Michael Myers was never about gore.  Transformers-messed it up. Gi Joe- messed it up  He-man-messed it up.  Avengers-messed it up.  Pretty much all 80’s reboots are messed up.  They have great characters but for some reason can’t get it right. The original Halloween 1 and 2 were the best.
No, sorry. The man died. And here he is, his clothes perfect. Him, not coughing at all. Sorry. Not gonna see this one. Laurie is now like 80 years old.
The movie is awesome but I don’t like that the firefighters died should’ve that fool burn to death.
Dont need a whole town to go after him just get John Wick with a pencil.
I remember seeing the trailer for the first time blindly  I was so confused seeing a house on fire thinking it was an insurance ad then I saw 3 girls on a truck and thought “WAIT A MINUTE” then I saw HIM & LITERALLY SCREAMED! BRUH I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THIS, THIS OCTOBER IS GONNA ROCK!
I love how they have the Halloween 3 masks!
Couple of years ago I was in a ghosthouse of a themepark, and there was a room with a lot of laundry hanging and then I saw only the feet of Michael Myers, and then he came walking to me. Best scare ever!!
I like the Halloween III masks ...
For the 80th halloween
i'm watching it a.s.a.p
Jamie Lee Curtis is an amazing actress !
they should have let it burn...
Laurie: “We’re family” Dominic Toretto: “You called?”
Make a Gears of war movie about emergence day, and a DEAD SPACE MOVIE.
Let it burn was my thought on theses movies till the 2018 movie
I feel the world needs Michael Myers in real life just evil that cannot be stopped
Can't  wait to watch  this movie
Laurie’s family: No no no no no  Michael Myers: YES YES YES YES YES
oooooh Myers is back....again ...is he....great...no Halloween is perfect without him.
Looks like it might be pretty good.  At least its not Halloweens 3.
This is nikkk anderson I been married for ten years
Fuck’em up Michael!!
Dude these trailers show the whole goddamn movie already........
Laurie and Karen need to die in this film!! Then they could build up Alyson as a girl whos lost everything her mom and dad and grandma hell even throw Cameron in there and now u have a badges character the people can get behind and in halloween ends you have her kill Michael to end to story
Eh yo James A Janisse, you here?
Reviews aren't looking good. Shame.
people : (Exists)  Michael : You wanna see my knife ?
Ive never been more ready to have nightmares.
I’m literally renting the whole theatre out once these go on sale
So freaking' psyched My junk is HarD
All the Halloween remakes Where's the Friday the 13th love?!
Who else thinks they should Michael alone I’m team Michael 🔥👌🏻
Laurie: 0:54  Michael: **w h e e z e**
Why they spoil all the kills in the trailer dumb
I’m going right when it comes out IDC
1:12 Jesus
Omg I can't believe I hadn't seen this. The original Halloween is my all time fav movie. I can't wait for this!!!
My favorite actors for Halloween 🎃 🥳 Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald plesence and spooky Michael Myers
If they were to run Myers thru a wood chipper producers of the franchise would somehow bring him back whole. One franchise that is definitely long past it's prime
“Evil Dies Tonight”.. hasn’t she been saying that since the 70s?
Now all we need is Dr . Loomis to make this movie complete 🙏🙏🙏 RIP Dr loomis .
Those poor firemen.
Damn, Michael has been killing people for over 40 years and he does not know how to die
This is gonna be a badass movie
does it really kill?
Does the second amendment include kitchen knives?
Let’s gooo
Damn the dude never die like a fkin terminator.
Honestly I don't understand the whole Michael vs. Laurie thing in this new timeline. They removed the Sister aspect of it. So what's the point in introducing 3 generations of Strode women. Michael isn't Laurie's brother so it isn't a "family" thing. Honestly they could've made these movies without Jamie Lee. Michael isn't even worried about her in 2018. She literally keeps putting herself in his path. Idk just lame to me. It's just like girl chill out. Michael is not even worried about you nor was he tryna track you down when he escaped.
Can't wait to see this
This looks amazing 👌
Well that's the best bits of the film
They showed the whole mf movie In the trailer tho …/ n how old is he now like 70???? Tf I don’t understand but it looks good lol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
*YIKES* ! I just realized something, (1:27) in the trailer the girl in the nurse costume dies. The same character who took a quick nervous look at Michal from the previous movie while Michael was wandering around. One heck of a delayed foreshadowing/reference if you ask me.
YESSSSSS!!!!
I'll be damn Mr. I Can't Die is back
Michael walks out the burning house! Me as a firefighter:🏃🏾‍♀️🏃🏾‍♀️🏃🏾‍♀️ (running)
The fact he used a saw
I can't wait to see this, in the words of Dr Loomis he describes Michael best, I met him, 15 years ago I was told there was nothing left, no reason, no conscience, no understanding in even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and the blackest eyes  the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up, because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.
So Michael Myers survived the fire by staying in lauries little gun garage that’s wild
Oh man, they just keep going, don't they? lol
Halloween kills , venom 2 let there be carnage , jackass 4 , sopranos prequel, dune movie, undertaker movie on netflix, and chucky tv series  I'm living for October lol
He's back
This is about the be fast paced horror considering it takes place in the same night
1:33 1:34 1:37 Halloween 3 reference eh? It took 39 years, but it finally looks another film in franchise acknowledges its existence. Nice!
This is showing to much for hecks sake
I honestly keep watching this trailer just for the first few scenes. Laurie screaming to “let him burn” sent chills down my spine. Michael going after the firefighters looked visually amazing. The part where one of the firefighters tried using the saw against Michael only for Michael to use it on him- Just holy crap, I’m excited for this movie
this is gonna be epic
HALLOWEEN KILLS ENDING:LAURIE HEARS KAREN BEING KILLED THROUGH THE PHONE IN JUDITHS ROOM.MYERS PICKS UP THE PHONE AND LAURIE THREATENS TO FIND HIM. AS LAURIE IS WALKING OUT OF HOSPITAL LAST THING WE SEE IS A CLOSE UP SHOT ON A KNIFE. TOMMY LEADS THE CHARGE IN GETTING REVENGE ON MICHAEL,LINDSEY SURVIVES, BRACKETT IS KILLED BY THROAT SLASH AND TOMMY DOYLE IS KILLED WITH HIS OWN BASEBALL BAT. HOPE I RUINED IT FOR U LOL
Ok it's official Halloween is now the COD of Movies they are just gonna milk this series until people riot in the streets the last movie reboot they did having Jamie Lee Curtis return after many years was a very good overall turn out but seeing this trailer kinda now just seems to ruin that last reboot and take away that nostalgia of having Jamie Lee Curtis return because I swear she didn't even want to do anymore Halloween movies and they got her back for one great final shot at a great ending to a great series and now they are like WAIT!! NOPE gotcha were not done and Jamie Lee Curtis oh you thought she was just asking a cone back for one final movie well hahaha jokes on you she sold her soul to us now we will make a Halloween for every Call Of Duty that Exists lmao
My man! Don’t worry, it’s just more people to kill.
I'm a big Michael Myers fan and with Jamie Lee Curtis still in the thought process of Halloween she Curtis still rocks
I'm a big Michael Myers fan I'm glad Jamie Lee Curtis is still in this thought process yes 40 tears later and she still Curtis still rocks
Super excited! Anyone think this series will end with this movie? Or am I the only one who thought Michael died in the last movie.
The next movie: Halloween kills...some more!
How can Michael sister even fight back if her arm cut and she's in the hospital
SO EXCITED! MOST EXCITED I HAVE EVER BEEN FOR A MOVIE!!!!!!
The last one she cut his head off.  Soooooo how is this movie possible?????
27 days
Really need to get the national guard on this guy or at least the swat team. Sheesh
I watched the original Halloween again recently.  Laurie got lucky.  Michael missed two easy stabs he shouldn't have.  I guess the evil force within him didn't have a complete grip on him yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
SO well edited....bravo.
Well I for one am always rooting for good ole Mike.
This wouldn't be possible in London... didn't they ban kitchen knives?
Thank
Getting ridiculous... He's been burned.. Shot.. Stabbed.. And still lives... So far fetched now.. Let poor double M die and be done with it..
I can't see this movie because it's rated r but damn the movie looks good
This 1 looks awesome
This was one of the previews showed when I went to the movie theater yesterday to see “Candyman” and when I saw there was gonna be another Michel Meyers (Halloween) movie I did the loudest gasp. Especially when I saw his mask was gonna get taken off…I was so excited my body froze in shock and my mouth was wide open.
26 days and counting......
The only way Michael will die is by electric chair and even then it will probably malfunction
When this is over the police and the state are gonna get absolutely reamed by the public for failing to stop one old man from killing dozens. The potential political and social consequences after this event really interest me.
I absolutely love the references to Halloween 3 season of the witch in this, those masks are awesome :)
It comes out on my birthday
2:23 Hasn't she been coming for ol' Mike for like 45 years?
Yeahh, Michael is steal alive
Cant wait
Really makes me wonder how so many people can get over-powered and killed by an old man whose missing a few fingers
Just like the 2nd movie
How I remember these movies as 80 kid..scary!
Damn through years this series still going can’t wait man 🔥
Bring it!! I can't wait
I should NOT be this excited for this movie to come out... but I freaking am😅!!! I love you Jamie 😍 💗
I just want Michael Myers surviving skills.. Nothing kills him 😂
Can't wait to see this
He walks faster than you Run
Great an SJW mob out on the streets looking for Michael
James A. Janisse is gonna have a great time with this one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=95s
It looks like the grand daughters dummbass boyfriend is gonna be one of Michaels victims...Noice
28 more days
“Take my hand!”  *takes hand  “AHHHHHHHHH”
OMG micheal myers is such a beast!  the dude is 60-70 years old by now and still killing people.   X__X
How are they gonna try to kill someone that’s immortal
I’m ready Micheal
None of these lame movies are as good as *Rob Zombie's* version. Sry.
Bro her taunting him with the mask is gonna be great!
Alysson gives me such a Claire Redfield vibe with her outfit. Especially at 1:40
Evil dies tonight heard that bullshit before
Omg I can’t wait to see this 😭
Jamie Curtis: LET IT BURN!!   Firefighter: that’s nt how this works
Can't wait for this movie to come out
Dude is an avengers level threat by now
In 10 years they cut out this sequel as well
I wish Rob Zombie made a third fourth and fifth
Clickbait looks like Bruce Willis.
am so excited to the new... wait michael back PARTY T,I.M,E.
thanks for showing mw all of the movie including the kills. gtfo
It feels more like a undercover T800 trying to kill sarah conner.
Michael myers goat Halloween legend every film they make nothing comes close how good halloween is every other film not in same league they run he walks and still knows how to strike with a knife the the whole town vs Michael no contest man be like bring it see where you end up against me  can't wait for this film
This will be a bad one…trust me
God, imagine going through all of that work in burning down your own house in the hopes of killing the man who tried to murder you and your family, only to see the fire department just going to do their jobs, not knowing who they’re rescuing.
0:38 He stabbed him with the wood end of that axe 🪓. Michael is straight OP.
What if Michael when he was a baby he was raised by people that worship the devil and people like teenagers saw them do a ritual and it was halloween night and the teenagers called the police and the police raid the place and they found Micheal and they put him in a hospital and a family adopted him and years years later the mom and dad have another baby and then on Halloween night Michael snaps and kills his sister that's my theory
LETS GOOO MICHEAL BEAT THEY ASS!! lol
I bet dollars to doughnuts, that the fire scene is a dream sequence!
This movie have really bad reviews. Brutality doesn't make a horror film to be scary. I have lost interest, especially since I heard it will be released directly on streaming
This is going to be fucking gooooooooooooood🤪
I agree with a lot of people in this comment section the whole town hunting Michael seems stupid.
1:33 Happy happy Halloween, Halloween Happy happy Halloween: Silver Schamrock!
Bro I'm sooo hyped for this movie
I really hope they don’t make some stupid reason why Micheal kills again. His mystery is the best part
How many more of these are there
The house on fire is what pulled me into the slasher fandom, and I don't regret a thing. The one time youtube ads are a good thing. :)
How’s it took me this long to realise the person in the truck at the end of Halloween 2018 is Tommy 😂
They getting on mike ass,aint they ?😂😂
Allyson: Do It. DO IT   Michael: Well now I don’t want to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=22s
If ur getting tickets for the first showing in ur theater gimme a hell yeah!!!!!
This is gonna be the longest 29 days of my entire life
If you want to see something super creepy, check out the Galveston Texas footage of a lawyer walking on the beach dressed like MM with a fake knife with blood on it from a few days ago. Not sure wtf he was thinking but the cops got him in cuffs. Weird shit.
Counting down the days for this
This completely shocks me, this trailer is the best ive ever seen
All Because the fire fighter fell through the floor😭
it SUCKS that they show SO MUCH in trailers nowadays!!
Jamie Lee Curtis is phenomenal. She makes Laurie Strode feel like a real person going through all of this for all these years in these movies! Can't wait for this ~ it was supposed to come out on my b.day this year but was postponed until next year. 😔I also can't wait for Halloween Ends to see how they tie the series up. I know Jamie will be awesome in them as well.
Stop. No one is asking for this.
So nobody told me about this?
He dose have family your not suppose to hurt killers
Is this finally going to be a horror movie where the phrase " I'm sorry I thought this was AMERICA" is going to be valid? Like the whole town hunting him and using all the guns they have on a psycho serial killer. And people are like we didn't we do this sooner.
I want to see Michael's face and it would be my concern of entire the movie...
Wheres Busta Rhymes when you need em 🤔
This movie is being released in 2021, so Michael doesn't stand a chance against the super whamen.
Before  u kill  the boogeyman,MAKE SURE ITS HIM then cut his head off or strap 100lbs of C4 on him
Micheal Chucky Jason Voorhees n more can  NEVER die Keep wishing tho
Omg enough with this shit. Seriously. We have enough Halloween movies. Make something new and interesting please (and I don't mean another reboot or sequel).
Let's Goooo! Can't wait to see this movie.
2:23 i'll be mad if the movie ends with people beating michael to death because she removed his mask and he became weak.
Man, I can't wait to see this one!
Above all, we still have to thank BlumHouse for these amazing horror/thriller movies!
Anybody notice how 1:29 the same girl in the nurse outfit is in the one shot in the 2018 movie is now gonna get killed. It’s funny because he was about to kill her in that movie but the guy found his keys just in time and they drove off. Crazy level of detail and continuity in this movie.
Best Pictures ever !!!!  H A L L O W E E N
Put me in this fight
Danny Mcbride is a beast!!!!!
I love how used a little reference from the third one when they tried to make killer kids masks
The critics need to remember this is the pivot in q trilogy. Everyone is complaining that everything is left without an end. What the f you think Halloween Ends is going to be? If they gave you all the answers; there wouldn't be a point to the third film.   You can liken this movie to Empire Strikes Back. Evil is winning; ll hope is lost. Just as a middle-act in a movie does; there is conflict and uncertainty. Now, apply that to a larger scale; as if the three acts are movies and Kills is Act II.  This movie just solidfies the first and prepares the table for the all-ending finale.
Little Tommy Doyle......amazing twist
I'm not really into horror movies too much, but I had heard some things good about this one. I love the 1978 original. This one looks awesome!
“Halloween - End’s” still coming out October 2022 or no?
Can they please let him die on this one I’m over him coming back
Where’s the US troops to kill him?:))
Spoiler alert!           Michael doesn't die.
That theme seriously gives me chills!
The things Dr. Loomis said years  Years Years ago is starting to bite haddonfield in the ass  “The boy had the palest skin and blackest eyes the devil’s eyes”   “What’s behind this boy is simply and purely evil”  , now Laurie knows he’s a true demon   “He’s the essence of evil”  “The more he kills the more he transcends “
I just realized that this trailer just spoiled Tommy Doyle's death. Unless it was done just to mislead the audience, shame on the editors for letting that slide.
Filme clássico 👏👏👏👏 ,  vou assistir com certeza.
28 days
I hope this is going to be better than the 2018 movie. That movie has some of the worst acting and blandest most pointless dialogue ever. And some of the most unintentionally funny scenes in the Halloween franchise.  And it also doesn't make sense that they changed the story taking away laurie strode's relation to Michael as brother and sister because it gives no reason to why Michael was after laurie to begin with. So fingers crossed for this part two.
I like that song too
I can't wait for its coming out I have the mask and the costume
Aiight I’m a lil confused. If this movie (along with the 2018 one) Is a sequel to the 1978 one, how the hell did they manage to get Michael back at the asylum in the the beginning of the 2018 one where they even had his mask? Didn’t he escape at the end of the original one?
He just can't die, come on 11 movies surviving lmao
I CAN’T WAIT TO SEE IT!!!
Michael will never die
zzzzzzzzzzz,,nothing will beat the first, nothing
This movie is the rebirth of resurrection
The last Halloween was fucking terrible.
Even if they kill Michael in a good final fight he’ll just return in a remake/another Halloween movie. “You can’t kill the boogie man” as Tommy Doyle said in the first movie…he will never truly die but that’s what makes the movies so good is he always comes back….but I feel like this is the best Michael time line…even if I have only seen the first and 2018 I still think they’re gonna pull something surprising or huge…if they do kill Michael it’ll have to be a really good death scene because he is more than a human tank you could even say he’s more evil than evil he’s an unstoppable insanity human that’s the devil…that’s the best way I could describe him.
1:46 I just realized that Michael is not wearing his mask in this scene.
OMFFGG AJSUSNJSSYES
I feel like this is celebrating the power of the American people. The will do anything to save everyone they can from a serial killer.
Wow !
31 days left!! 🎃🔪
Social distancing and wearing a mask in public since 1971!
Possible SPOILER…..          Has anyone else noticed that Marion was wearing a purple sweater when Michael grabs her hair in the car, and then one of the dead bodies on the playground is wearing a purple sweater 🥺 This is probably the end for her.
1:32 that's the couple we saw when Michael was walking around the town in Part 1. Where the husband goes back inside bc he forgot his stethoscope. I think they're supposed to be the parents of the kid from Part 1 too.
DUDE I NEED MORE THEME SONG FROM MICHEAL SO FREAKING COOL.
What happened to Laurie’s son?
Why don’t they just call John Wick?
A Halloween sequel where Michael survives a lethal pitfall wherein Laurie Strode spends most of the film in a hospital while the denizens of the town seek safety and to be rid of the killer? 1981 called and they want their film back.
tbh you cant kill michael the guy not even human😭😭
Michael Myers is a fan of Burning Man? 🔥. Who knew? The last film should have been the end. But it appears he’s unkillable. An immortal. Like Jason.   And this film will make some money and Michael will survive for yet another unnecessary sequel. He’s a cash cow! Let’s face it.   And Jamie Lee Curtis went from a cute teenager in the first film to a haggard old woman in this film 40 years later. He aged her with all that stress.
so fucking juiced
Anyone else notice the three different masks from Silver Shamrock?
Dead by daylight irl 😎🔪
The last one was horrible..Hope this is better ,.. don’t look like it
With the new timeline, gotta up the qty of kills to be competitive with the other slashers, hence Halloween Kills.
Halloween kills. I don’t want to hear it.
I'm being Michael Myers for Halloween so this coming out is absolutely perfect.
She is much more bad ass than Sarah connor.
I can’t be the only one who finds micheal hot. It’s my stupid mask psychopath kink
Boa noite, esse filme pesado e sinistro. Adorei o vídeo.
Really another Mike fellow needs to come down here boring movies something new guys

Maybe leave something for me to see in the actual movie?
I can’t wait to see this!
Too much. You showed too much.
1:02-2:10
I love Halloween but I've gotta be real . . . . I'm so done with Michael Myers
Can’t wait
somehow i havent seen this until now
I have really high hopes for this movie. 🎃
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=211s
The spiffy family early unlock because leo therapeutically arrest towards a unequaled onion. mere, languid sky
Michael Myers: Jesus, won’t you people just kill me already?!
They showing to much of the movie??
Michael got his booster shot , and now he still is wearing a mask
Man I hope this is the perfect ending to this Saga of horror.
Saw the 2018 movie in theaters and it didn’t disappoint. I’m definitely ready for this one as it shouldn’t disappoint either.
correct me if I'm wrong but at 1:48 the crowd is chanting "He dies tonight." Or is it something else?
3.8K dislikes you gotta be kidding me this shit is banging
You want your mask? Come and get it!  Michael: Thanks, but I only wear N95 masks.
First
This isn't a trailer it's damn near the whole movie
James A. Janisse (aka Dead Meat) bouta be pissed when he realises he's gonna count so many bodies from this film
At 1:32 you can see the shamrock masks from Halloween 3: Season of the Witch. Maybe they’ll connect the movies after all.
This is breathtaking amazing, I love the entire mob idea and the new soundtrack, just watching them all protest was amazing!!! Im gonna watch this in theaters, buy it on Amazon prime and blu-ray.
- Do it - DAAAAAA ITT
It’s too bad they have run out of ideas and are now following the Friday the 13th formula…..Michael is no Jason.
The murderer and thief is the one you serve
Evil...Dies...Tonight...  ....again!
Trailers giving alot away I must say.. wheres my tea and crumpets
I’m going to be honest this trailer is really well put together.. The sound design with John carpenters music gets you so pumped for this movie!
Jamie Lee Curtis was the reason I loved the last film, and I fucking hate horror movies. Having her go full badass again is right up my alley.
i hope this is the last of myers but wait isn't freddy vs jason vs michael next?
Finally good Halloween movies! Since Halloween 2 we got trash and now we're finally back on track!
Wewwewewewewewewewewewewewe
This trailer was better than the entire Malignant movie.
For the brother to die, so must his sister.
i really like these movies ......but i really hope this is the last one
Dammmmmnnnn!!!😳😳😳
ALL SATANIC MOVIES,  How can not everyone see this? The World is run by SATANISTS!!!EVIL RULES the WORLD
This isn’t gonna be the last one next year there’s gonna be the final movie called ‘Halloween Ends’
This is the new movie
Unless he kills 25 people in this film they already basically gave up and spoiled a lot of kills already you know he kills the boyfriend…
can’t freaking wait😭😭
Michael why did you kill the whole town? Say something damn it!!!  Micheal: Self Preservation.
Instead of saving him i would’ve gave Michael a fireman application nigga immune to fire
He is pissed, going to kill the whole town this time around. Can't wait to see it.
THIS MOVIE IS GONNA BE BAD ASS! Can’t wait!
I love Halloween and I thought about sharing a quick video with y’all, it’s Michael’s best kills http://youtu.be/j8PxqgliIno
Michael kills Laurie and the others, movie ends, franchise over.
Wouldn’t you just fly to another country m, it’s not like he’s going to get on a plane
Looks like more feminist BS 'Strong women' beats MALE killer', not only that, I can't stand retcon. The franchise finished in 1981 for me with Halloween 2. I will not be watching this.
The Firefighters are dumb lol shoulda jus listen to her and let it burn🤦😂🤣
Itd be cool if after they ripped off his mask, it shows the back of his head and his hair is no longer grey...as if the killing is revitalizing him
Nothing can stop Michael Myers. COVID  ... hold my beer!  😢🎃
2026: laurie strode vs Halloween  2030: Tommy Doyle vs laurie strode 2034: Michael Myers Revival vs Jason Voorhees
Micheal Myers gotta be like 90 years old now ... still running around killin people.. damn he be rollin around using a walker by niem
it's gonna be available on peacock as well on the same day that it will be in theaters
sandwhich
man they spoiled the whole movie
the last one was so good
"Michael Myers is alive." "Evil dies, tonight."  "I'm coming for you, Michael..."
Huge fan of the series and Michael Myers. It looks good, but the point of making this more about Jamie Lee Curtis and how 3 women are going to hunt down and kill the most bad ass of all is a joke. Green's Halloween was very good, but come on please. Any fan knows that it's about The Shape and not Laurie effin Strode. Tone her down.
Taunting Michael with his mask? Doesn't he need it to prevent himself against the coof?
One of the best franshises period. Can't wait! !!
It blows my mind that a 61 year old Michael Myers is still capable of killing an entire town.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
Bru that poor fireman tried to save his boys with a saw only to get it shoved right into his face
Yes
He is no mere man. Only the essence of pure evil.
If only Mrs. Strode had put dynamite in that damn basement...
Let me tell you something........"No one can Kill the Boogeyman!"
"he couldn't have survived that fire".  Um, he started surviving fires 40 years ago.
Nah I'm waiting for the prequel or halloween is space
I keep coming back....I can't stay away
Karen is so dead. I know it.
Epic 🎃
Finish him!!!
Trailer out 2 months and not even 200k likes.
Laurie and her family should move to China or Alaska ,then he wouldn’t find them
THIS LOOKS SO GOOD
I been watched all dim movies since lil mf was born. Scary headed ahhh. Defs gon go watch dis oh
Don't know if this was mentioned or not but did anyone see the "Nurse and "Doctor" with the pumpkin heads! they were the couple in the first movie where he was walking  Amongst the children tricker treating and she stared back at him. I love how they are connecting a small seen like that to the first film!
Boooooooring. All these movies have exactly the same plotline. Why should I even bother? Killer comes back from the dead. Kills a few people, then dies... until the next one. Whatta snooze!
kyle richards-"michael, you need to be open and honest!" (does the splits)
this is cool af and im hyped, but they spoiled a lot of shit in this whatttt
This boy look fire and they took his mask off 😳
Absolutely Bravo to everyone involved, this looks incredible.
Meh... idk.... You telling me that fucking trained fire fighters wouldnt even fight back... Too much.
This trailer shows waaaaay too much…… That being said the fireman scene looks pretty brutal and kick ass
I got chills when Laurie was screaming at the firefighters NO, NO, NO!!! LET IT BURN! 😭👏🏻 I need to watch all the Halloween movies plus the 2019 plus this one! Apparently I was talking to a coworker today and he tells me this is the last one!! If it is Laurie better go out one last time like a badass she is!!
eliminating halloween 2 from the story line was this new timelines biggest mistake
DUDE YES
This looks awesome! I’m really looking forward to this
Milk the Cow
Whenever I think of Killers like Mike myers etc, I think, at some point they must go for a shit. and what do they do, read something? look at their phone. And they must have to cook something too. or maybe if they are in a rush, a drive thru or something. Crazy mawn
In fact Evil does not 'die tonight' , because there is a third movie being made in this particular series.
So 1978 Halloween and last one and this one only count not the other Halloween movies so Halloween 2 Halloween h20 Halloween resurrection did not happen
This is gonna be an intense film
Dude has unlimited revives.
saw this at the venice, the killings and the deaths alone made it worth seeing!
U know he's pissed off when he's killing anyone in his way
Nice to see Carol from the Walking Dead in other movies.
It seems that the director stills has no clue as to what made the original Halloween so scary and great. The last version was a huge disappointment and this seems to top even that.
Look good af can’t wait to see it 😯😳
It would have been awesome if the merry-go-round mask's were Freddy, Jason, Hellraiser and Chucky.
Evil dies tonight  Michael- Bitch, I'm right here
...hear me out 👀
Bro Michael is so scary the he walks out the house the fire Didn’t affect him at all

We are waiting for that moment.. 😜
I'd rather watch *GG ALLIN* instead. He's actually for real .
I'm just here to see the Kyle Richards death scene
"Evil dies tonight"    but what about the sequel Halloween Ends?  why not have that line in that movie where it makes more sense?
We hunt him down Me an intellectual: yeah good luck with that
The last movie didn’t tell us how Laurie strode survived after Michael stabbed and made her fall off the roof in Halloween resurrection.
Watches trailer, sees the whole film
Halloween (2007) and Halloween II (2009) by Rob Zombie are among the best.
❤ The best places in Dubai ❤ 🇦🇪 ✌  https://youtu.be/Gv4eyHO3mt4
Oof love that bad ass Jamie lee Curtis scenes aah and her niece purr as they should 💯💁🏾‍♀️ ..
Oof love that bad ass Jamie lee Curtis scenes aah and her niece purr as they should 💯💁🏾‍♀️ ..
It's a good thing she has a big kitchen knife because otherwise she might be in trouble 😏😜!
WE HAVE BEEN HEARD!! THAT THE EVIL DIES TONIGHT FOR THE LAST 20+ YEARS " SO THIS TIME IS REALLY GOING TO DIE.....!!
Did they get an actual robot to play Michael. The hell is up with those movements? Anyone else feel like this is another terminator 6 or whatever where they might kill Michael and then make him a girl or something for "female empowerment"?
he just wore a latex mask inside a structure fire and came out.... not even a little bit melted. redflag
im gagging
Would check it out if I was sure Michael Myers would die - but he hasn't in 43 years
Anybody catch the masks the kids are wearing at 1:33? Halloween 3 season of the witch.
Nightmare on Elm Street & Friday the 13th needs to learn how to make sequels like this!
Did Kojima direct this trailer
@2:24 is the final shot 🤷 Karen definitely does n she's pissed bout it.
HE KILLED A BLACK PERSON IN 2021. HE GOT CANCELED
i do like how badass the family is
We fight?! Stupid. You are supposed to be afraid of Michael Myers. Another woman power bullshit movie. I'm done with Hollywood. They don't understand how to make good movies anymore.
0:46. Right now where was I?
I'm wondering what michael does for the rest of the year when it's not halloween night?
The comment section illustrates an interesting twist, not only for the film, but society's perception in general.   The townsfolk are mindless psychopaths hunting down a severely traumatized  victim. You see Michael Myers was created by bullies, then bullied by those who incarcerated him, in what they conned Michael into as a safe space. As an adult, Michael escapes from his "safe space," looking for a fair tidbit of justice and his step sister. He merely wants to re-connect and sort a thing or two out. The townsfolk not only continue to deceive him, but they continue to hunt him down, tear him down with their hatefulness, and try to kill him. He was not even allowed to remain in his childhood home as his true safe space.  What the movie line fails to reveal are two credits to Michael's cause. Hopefully in the next installment Michael will get a fair shake and the true nature of Haddonfield will be revealed. Michael is a bisexual with gender dysphoria and he is in love with his step sister Laurie. What he is really dealing with are small town mindless psychopathic gun-toting homophobic sexists bent on destroying this poor soul. And if you think things couldn't get worse for Michael, the townsfolk are also very likely racist Trump supporting anti-vaxers. You can hardly blame Michael for having a grievance. Hopefully, he finally gets a fair shake.  I anticipate that the next installment will reveal these facts, and that we will see a Michael-Laurie romance, marriage, and little Michael-Laurie twins.
I hope Michael myers learns a lesson
At least Michael is thinking about COVID in this film.  Good on him for wearing a mask!  #KillerExample
At least someone is STILL wearing a mask. Kept him alive this long.
looks pretty good
Why am I just now finding out this exists and is coming out next month. I knew there'd be another but have heard no news until today, seeing a review from an article talking about how bad it is
It's finally almost here I'm so excited.. I was so bummed they had 2 back it a year last year because of covid but I know the wait will be worth it.. halloween is my favorite horror movie.. the count down is on..
😷
Thanks, Trailer making douchbags. You just about gave away the whole film. It's not all bad though. You just saved me $25.
Is it just me or is Michael seem more gruesome than he usually is 🤨
Halloween 2018: Michael coming out of retirement Halloween Kills: Doomguy
This series must have some record of most number of timelines branching from the first movie: -Halloween + Halloween 2 (Michael's original death) -Halloween + Halloween 2 (Michael somehow surviving) + Halloween 3/4/5/6 -Halloween + Halloween 2 + Halloween H20 (Michael's 2nd official death) *ignores Halloween 4/5/6* -Halloween + Halloween 2 + Halloween H20 (Michael survives due to stupid retcon) + Halloween Resurrection -Halloween + Halloween (2018) + Halloween Kills
I doubt it will be anywhere as good as Halloween 1, and 2 (yes the sequel from 81) which will always be the official two for me, but as it's own trilogy it could be an enjoyable three part movie series, 4 if you include the first, which I guess is part of these new movies.  I enjoyed Halloween 2018 for what it was, but apart from Micheal Myers (who was menacing, and looked great), and the music, I found it to be a decent, but uneven movie much like H20 was.  The sequel here seems to treat Michael as if he's Jason Voorhees slashing anything he encounters with gushing gore effects.    Like the 2018 movie, Halloween Kills seems to lift parts from other movies, like the hospital from 2, and the mob to kill Michael in 4.  Perhaps the movie will be entertaining enough, despite the recycled elements from other movies, but I'm not seeing much original stuff to make this new series stand on it's own merits.  I also get many people didn't like the direction of Halloween 2 (which I very much like), so if this new trilogy works for them great, regardless of how this trilogy ends, I'll always have the first two movies.
Reviews are saying this is gonna be a darker and more violent sequel! Reviews so far are pretty good 😁
The utter lack of LGBQT  in the Halloween movies is despicable.  Universal needs to do a better job of enforcing representation,
I can't wait to see it! 😳🎃 I'm ready! 😊
Just had to come here and see this gem one last time before October:) after seeing the reviews I can already tell we are in for a fire halloween 🙆🏻‍♀️
Did anyone notice the mask from season of the witch or was that just me? 🤯🤯🤯
Being evil doesn't make you immortal
Omg I just noticed the witch hanging is the nurse from the original dead I guess she dies like in h20 with throat slit
I want to see a Halloween & Paul Blart crossover film.
So this Halloween some will set fires on all the pedo's in Hollywood?  A good day!  The fires have already started.  Yawn.
I’ve not watched any trailers for this and I can’t wait, last trailer (2018) ruined all the best /jump scare scenes
Yep, this is the definition of plot armor
I think it would be cool to see someone make a Michael Myers game
Halloween is the best event of the year. I cannot wait for this movie.
Dexter Morgan- I'm  a serial killer.   Michael Myers- Hold my Beer.
All she had to do was give me her number that night in 78
Action movie/ horror
🎃 I just hope in the new Halloween movie both Laurie and Michael can finally lay to rest so we can get on with our lives lol it's been 50 years and there still going at it 😂😂 #TeamMyers vs.#TeamLaurie
You want your mask come and get it, Michael, fuck that I'm not getting fine or getting covid.
This going to be a crazy ass  Michael Mayer’s movie and they got the whole town armed and ready for his crazy ass lol
Dbd skins anyone?
And here we all thought evil died in 1981
Anyone notice the 3 dead on park merry go round had on masks from Halloween 3 season of the witch?  Wonder if Easter egg or they are gonna remake that movie?
I’m so hyped for this movie 😩
"Evil dies tonight" 😂😂😂 Yea okay sure.
How the hell is it that after all of these years, Halloween is still looks this good??? Look forward to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
Knowing they are making a third movie just says Evil doesn’t die tonight
this feels like another cash grab, looks like halloween 2 but they ONLY way he will die is to TAKE HIS FUCKING HEAD!!!
Already some spoilers. Nancy loomis dies, Allyson's boyfriend/date is likely to die, the two afro-americans in the car die, the elderly couple die, all the firefighters die, most of the men trying to fight Michael will die. I mean.. c'mon - can't you leave us with at least some excitement?
Even if he wears a mask he looks visibly pissed off
I can’t wait to see this movie been a Halloween finatic since day 1
GUYS FUCK THATS NOT FİNİSH??!!!!!!!!!!???
If he level ups now, I hope they'll make him super human like jason so he can be reborn, get back from hell, possessing other people, wanna see his face zumbified rotten inside the mask for 15 more films just like jason. He deserves his change to go out there and face devil itself, Dean and Sam, let's make Michael Myers vs Scooby Loo or vs Cruella, whatever
My boy Mikey is going for the high score in this one it seems, nice.
Just came here after seeing halloween 2018...can't wait for this one
A skeleton, witch and jack o lantern mask... good nod to Halloween III
Can't wait until oct 15 to add this on my halloween 🎃 folder ......one of most fav horror franchise after the Friday 13th , texas chainsaw massacre, wrong turn & SCREAM😘😘❤️❤️✌️
I’ll stick to rob zombie’s version
They probably should bring Busta Rhymez back into this.
Kenny motherfucking Powers wrote this movie?!
They ever gonna put an end to the series
I like the homage to the three masks from season of the witch.
How many times has he died now lol.
This film is going to bee epic
That’s look really good
I love Jamie Lee Curtis!
They need to give up on this bullshit! That rubber mask would have melted, his dickies suit would have been burnt up. Fuck outta here with this shit
These last 2 movies are just… awful. L
They could try drowning him, or would he team up with Jason? 🤣
Every Halloween movie - “Michael Myers is dying tonight!”
JESUS!!! how many fucking times are we going to go thru this??? its the same shit over and over!!!! They trap  him, chop his head off and put it in a blender and he still manages to escape and Lori says, " hes back...we messed up...Im not gonna let it happen again" its like come on!!!! and theres one more sequel??? it should have just really genuinely ended in a bang with the first one!!! please END HALLOWEEN already... before it gets remade by some other rock star or hot shot director
All is good as long as Rob zombie isn't involved.
Imagine being a kid scarred for life bc a killer attacked u and ur babysitter, then 40 years later ur in his grip by the throat staring evil in the face bout to get murked out, the irony 🎃 🔪
I know it's just the trailer but michael hadn't lost 3 fingers on his left hand when he was shot by laurie
just the sound from 0:27 till 0:46 kills holy shit.
How anyone could think Jason, Leatherface or Freddy could hold a candle to this guy is beyond me.  A zombie, a retard and a clown vs. evil incarnate.  Hands down Michael Myers is the scariest killer of them all!
Bad ass.
The next Halloween it’s Halloween and
With all this excitement I gotta watch this at the theaters. My house is not good enough
His Gana reach stalk lvl3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=60s
It won't be long until October rolls around
Easter egg: the masks on the merry-go-round are a reference to holloween 3.
Next month can’t come soon enough. Michael Myers is my fav. 🧡
I’m so excited for this to come out!
This scream is from round2hell channel 1:52
The cgi was so bad when he walked out of the house
They just showed every damn kill in the movie😐
The night he took it to far… He no man    He’s the boogeyman
cant wait for ice nine kills to make a song about that one!
Guys its less than a week until its in our hands!! After 15 MONTHS of waiting. It's finally here!!
movie looks fucking awful jesus christ
"I'm coming for you, Michael."
‘He’s the essence of EVIL’ … lol aren’t they all 😅
Jamie lee look at you Bo$$
2:18  Michael : mmm yeah I think I will
I like Jamie Lee Curtis, but her acting in the previous Halloween film was garbage. And judging by this trailer, her acting is going to be garbage in this one too.
This looks epic cant wait to watch it
Ya asen puras wevadas
They brought JLC back to make the series believable... This movie 🤑 any person that pays to see this is thick as fuck.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
Epic
Do we think it’s LVP or Denise Richards who bashed Kyle’s head in here?
october please hurry up
OMG!!!!! I can't wait to see it. I ❤️ Horror movies!!!!!
Let it burn
U
I’m absolutely ready for this Michael is a beast and I also love Laurie strode ❤️🎃🔪
How many times will this movie be remade 🤦

Who is that eyeless ghost girl at 0:55 and 1:35 ?
Let the the house burn I’ll kiss your fuc$ing Dalmatian!
Glad to see the Dark Universe has been revised to actual horror
Guys, the second trailer for Halloween Kills has been leaked. At Cinemacon reporters gave a description of what they seen and described the end of the trailer consisting of Laurie Strode trying to remove Michaels mask.   Guess what?  That's un-true. IT'S LINDSAY WALLACE! She is the one who removes his mask.
Pretty much just watched the whole film by the looks of ig
John Carpenter once suggested that Halloween was a "silly" film. Now of course I strongly disagree with that as most who saw the original at the time would; .there were maybe only 4 kills in that film, not enough blood to fill a coffee cup, and _that_ film was one of the scariest films in history. This, is a disgraceful cash-grab.
1:22 wasn't killing him the point of the last movie?
Blum house. SUCKS! Like there horrible films!
Ugh...let The Shape die...
That Season of the witch wooooo!!
RELEASE THE 2ND TRAILER ALREADY
My God, I'm 45 yrs old.  I remember watching these. Every single one on mischief night, & Halloween night.  When I saw the carousel, with the masks of the pumpkin, witch, & skeleton, it took me right back.  That's Halloween 3 .  This looks actually fantastic.  I don't care if I have to call out of work. I'm going. Happy Halloween 🎃🎃🎃
More dumb horror films. Cool. Humans sure are something...
HAHAHAHHAHA  DEAD
No point of going to cinema the trailer has basically shows the start of the movie and most of the killings
Reporter: So Michael, how many people do you want to kill?  Michael: Nods
Me while watching this:  yes,YeS YES,YES YES YES YES YES
Me while watching this:  yes,YeS YES,YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Wish they could’ve used the same still shots and first person POV of Michael in these movies. Would’ve added that creepy cold feeling as it did in 1978
Having a 80 year old woman say I'm coming for you and trying to act tough and menacing isn't cool.....its really fucking lame and cringey.
They aged 3 years in the middle of the night  🤷🏻‍♂️
1:33 He killed Julians parents 🥺
Forbid this happening!!! . ...
Myers for President
Everyone: he’s dead!!! Michael: well yes but actually no
I wonder if Ray (the father) will be forgotten about in this movie
gomila ljudi protiv michaela, to će biti zanimljivo za pogledati
The idea of the whole town being aware of him and all wanting him dead is such an interesting direction
I wonder if will come out on prime or HBO max bc think have to have vaccine now to go in cinemaa which I don't have
I hope Allison boyfriend not in this
Michael is killing black people!  That's racist!!!!!
1:52
I’m excited for the other movie
This looks so awful!!! Such a shitty story line. What a shame
Not again ugh
Halloween is kill :(
I cannot wait for this movie to come out
Can’t wait super fan
Is it ok if I go to the movie theater on opening night with a jumpsuit and my 1978 Michael Myers mask on?
jakob 17
When he picks up his mask you know Micheal just did something dope 😂Bc she had his mask
Transcends? Mf what?! Saying dumb shit like that will make me not go see this movie!
I’ve been watching the Halloween Movies ever sense I was 11 in the 00’s, I’m so excited to watch this in theaters.
Fucking goosebumps I’m fucking ready let’s fucking gooo
Make no mistake The Shape will die... Just not in this movie. He will be killed off in Halloween Ends. and the Next Halloween movie after that will need to be a full on reboot. John Carpenter's Halloween will end With Halloween Ends. if that don't get you hyped to see how the official 40 year story will come to a close I don't know what will.
This Trailer need absolutely the cover Halloween Theme song form Orbit Culture!!
Are we not going to talk about how there’s going to be 13 Halloween movies… it’s so overdone at this point
Michael is the essence of evil but also the essence and embodiment of everything I'm scared of
What if someone chops michaels body into different pieces and hides each body part in different rural parts of the world ?
I don't like someone who kills people for no reason.
guys dont type in halloween kills on youtube and search some asshole spoiled the entire movie by posting in a title what happens im livid
Look badass
John carpenter did this movie so it’ll be amazing
I can’t ducking wait
Let this be the last one I wanna see  a horror movie actually end
Do y’all realize Halloween kills and Halloween ends will be the last Decent made halloweens for the rest of our lives for the rest of eternity in this world probably this is heart breaking
I stopped halfway through. I don’t want anymore spoilers. They put too much in the ad
QUEEN JAMIE LEE CURTIS !
Michael Myers is the GOAT
Reports are that this is getting pushed to October 2022 because of the Delta variant.
Giancarlo 🃏Myers 🦈 Hell#A!
It's good to see how these movies are giving honor to the original saga after the crap that Rob Zombie did
I'm absolutely hyped for this movie!!!!! Can not wait to watch it!!!!
1978: Halloween 2018: Halloween 2021: Halloween Kills 2022: Halloween Dies
Do you guys mind if I do a reactio to this trailer I’m simply asking for permission so I  won’t get copyrighted in any way possible
Can we Michael Myers vs Chucky or something like that after this. We haven't had a good vs movie since Freddy vs Jason. Come to the think of it, that was the only vs movie. Guess we'll just have to stick to Godzilla I guess
😎
I can't wait
Laurie: Let’s hunt him down! Mob: Yeah, let’s do it!! Michael: https://youtu.be/UBBnn4hMt4Q
Was the fire fighters fighting back?
One of the most enduring film franchises in history, (James Bond is way older) , I saw the first, in 1978 Freshmen in high school age 15, I'm 58 now, the first is still my favorite!
I love the Witcher feeling violin in the background
Jamie Lee Curtis is such a bad ass!  Glad she has stuck around for this whole franchise!  Kick some ass!
I looooove how curtis is still with the shits!!!!!!👍👍👍👍👍❤️‍🔥
It feels like they hardly tried yet everyone is buying into it cause it’s Michael haha
They should just remake halloween h20 tbh
Got nothing but respect for this classic Slasher. Incredibly happy to see this, it’s the ending of a forever legacy.  Edit: Just watched it Friday night. Absolutely thrilled with what we got. Definitely give it a watch.
I wanna see this where can I watch it
I know that you all are Michael Myers fans but I’m into this because of how badass laurie is.
those god damn fire fighters ruined this shit
Malek Akkad's a badass
I cannot wait until this comes out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
Garbage
NEXT MONTH!!!!!
Bro I'm telling uuu this man pissed off just give this man a girl n sum candy and he will be ight
bro, the army can easily kill him. he cant kill hundreds of armed men with an axe.
The hunter becomes the hunted
I like this one ☝️
So wait, I thought that only Halloween 1978 existed in this universe but yet at 1:33 there are obviously Silver Shamrock masks. Writers, director and producers lie again. No surprise there, I'll say it again Michael Myers with a 'body county' isn't a Halloween film. Its Friday the 13th in Halloween clothes
The icky mouse regretfully yell because creditor sequently trap before a unable band. mountainous, upset poison
Oooo let's go 🔥
This is going to be 🔥
Does his mask protect him and has he been vaxxed?
This movie will have a shit ton of kills.
The new theme sounds too hillbilly & not really law abiding. The struggle music is good, but the main theme sounds like a rape mattress.
I am really looking forward to this film.
i remember this in 2018 and im excited!
Great, after this movie they're going to ban knives also.
yes i will watch this
He never dies
Michael Myers just creeps me the F%*k out!!! Can't wait to see this!
Don't worry, its just tony ferguson with a mask!
Heys guys I have an idea. Halloween 3 return of the witch. Sets place in modern time. Flashing pumpkin on cell phones, computers, that trigger Michael Myers masks. I'm dead serious!! I would love to see this movie. Any thoughts?? Actors for the roles?? Please reply any hardcore fan.
I hear the doctors voice from Halloween 5 going " no no no no no ' when he walks out the fire.
I hope and pray that this testimony will help   you to stay away from all occult practices; such as halloween celebrations, horoscopes, astrology, palm reading, fortune telling, divination and such...   When I was about 19 years old. We moved to a rental house that was previously occupied by someone practicing occult.  I didn't like what I felt when I was inside.  I had a feeling that someone terrible and evil was watching me.  It was scary. At night I saw shadows that moved.  I saw very scary faces on the walls, ceilings, floors...Many times I felt that someone evil was standing behind me, but when I would turn around, there would be no one standing. I was scared.   In my heart I decided to turn to God for help. I decided to fast and pray  until God helped me. I turned off all entertainment. I only left my school books. In the morning and before bedtime I prayed, read the Bible, especially The New Testament part, memorized Bible verses that I liked. I fell asleep thinking about what I read.  Also I practiced reciting Bible verses in my head, until I would fall asleep.  I was not without food everyday, but fasted as much as I could. After some time, one night, Jesus Christ opened my bedroom door, walked in, and stood by the side of my bed.  I remember how I sat down in my bed and gasped: "Jesus!"  He looked very seriously, almost sternly around my room and became invisible.  And in one moment, everything that stalked me, just vanished forever from my life.  The dark, evil forces that watched me, disappeared.  It was a miracle! I even deliberately tried to see something, but everything disappeared forever. So many years went by, but His protection is still with me.  It was a real, real miracle from God that happened in my life. This is my true testimony.  Jesus Christ is real, very real, alive and almighty, omni powerful and omnipresent. I experienced it, and I know that God can do anything!  We just need to put in a little faith and effort and ask Him to help us. May the Lord bless you too, to experience the same wonderful miracle in your life. All demonic forces are terrified of the name of Jesus Christ and His blood. Jesus Christ is God! He is a real, invisible, living God! Thank you Lord that You are real and You are Good!!!  You are with us, and You come to our aid in any situation. Hallelujah to my Savior and my God!  If you are not familiar with Jesus Christ, but suffer from fear, evil spirits, or anything else, that makes you depressed or anxious, just call His name, and ask Jesus Christ to remove whatever it is, that brings sufferings to your life.  God bless you
I like the idea of him being beyond evil
Laurie: Evil Dies Tonight Micheal: https://youtu.be/wPsaQojX7qM
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
"evil dies tonight"  how soon we forget. you can't kill the boogeyman. that's my only hope for this: the mob makes things worse, and the end is still Strode vs. Shape
Anyone else notice the Season of the Witch Masks at 1:35
wow not then showing the entire escape from the basement in the first minute of this trailer…. way to ruin half the movie. also they show the ending of this movie in the trailer as well… like goddamn leave something to the imagination!
If Michael wasn’t mad before he’s definitely going to be now since he was left for dead in a fire
I love it: Jamie Lee Curtis, John Carpenter, Nick Castle, Kyle Richards, Nancy Stephens, Charles Cyphers! So excited for this reunion movie!
I really don’t want Kyle to die…
Maaaan you fucked up if you took of his mask
Allyson: Let's hunt him down. Whole town: YEAH! LET'S DO IT!!! Michael: Oh no! Anyways...
The Hunter becomes the hunted
Enough with the Jamie Lee Curtis.  The last movie sucks so bad I couldn't stand it. In this crappy story line Halloween 2 never even happened.  Definitely should have left her storyline alone and ended it with Halloween H2O.  Everything from Halloween 3 to the curse of Michael Myers was a complete jumbled mess.  Which was consummated by delusional directors without a clear Direction.  Halloween H2O was a good way to end the original story arc.  Rob Zombie's first remake was okay but not great.  The second one was total dogshit.  I am a fan of Jamie Lee Curtis but it is way past time to move on.  This is coming from the heart of a true fan of the original movie.
1:56 That old man in the background  lol
I love all the Halloween films apart from Halloween 3 as it didn’t have Jamie-Lee-Curtis in ,,,,,,, can’t wait for this one
Shit gonna be a dub 🔥
There is so many dislikes on this and why fucking why!!! It’s Halloween kills wtf
I love the trailer but at the same time I’m worried as they basically spoiled the entire movie .  Too many details
I NEED TO SEE THIS ASAP BUT GOTTA WAIT TILL OCTOBER WHOS GOING?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=4s
Was kinda corny that the reason he lived was because the fire fighters went to a house in the middle of nowhere.
I wish we had candyman vs Michael myers, it'll be sick
Imagine he came out the fire with the h5 mask on. He just change to a new mask like the 80s.
Wow!
Looks like it's more of action film. It better be scary.
Not sure how many Halloween movies have been made but the first one is the only one worth watching.
All they need is someone from dead by daylight to loop him and we’ll be fine
Si sólo el tráiler provoca terror, la película definitivamente promete.
So basically avengers: Halloween

just a bit too gruesome for me. sacrificing plot for extremities. I ain't for it.
ew is that kyle richards 💀
I would love to see all of those people towards the end of the trailer jump on Michael, and then he grabs the baseball bat from that one dude amd hits him with it and just goes berserk on all of them
47 days
This looks so terrible!
Why does this not have more likes
BROOOO I CANT WAIT!! THIS LOOKS AMAZING
So what happened to her son? She only got the daughter now?
I am a huge Myers fan and appreciate massively that the fanchise is still continuing to this day n age...at 40 yrs oldright now ai want more halloween films to watch in my 80s!
You know, Jamie's character is the only one in horror movies to survive throughout sequels  That ik of
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Definitely the netx film I'm gonna watch Can't wait for This
Everyone: he dies tonight  Michael: where's my knife 🔪 😤
Michael vs the world
Bro i can't believe this trailer was 2 months ago.
Over kill time to stop while a head
Awww don’t be shy, just show us the entire movie already.
Bro it’s fire 🔥
Why doesn’t Laurie just move her family overseas? I can’t imagine Michael getting his passport application accepted
I am so looking forward to this, best horror films ever are Halloween films, never stop making them
Laurie: No No No Usher: Let It Burn
Anyone dead by daylight fan... 🤔🤔😅😅🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️
https://youtu.be/pG17ypWnqzo
Jesus, Haddonfield just has a massacre of like 6 people once, and then 30 years later has a massacre in that dwarfs it + a town riot in just one night. that's almost worse than just having myers show up every other Halloween in the old timeline.
Yes YES
Cannot wait to see it!
🥴🥴🥴🥴
I’ll be watching this
So hyped for this movie!
The spirit is good my friends
Evil is not an essence it's the emotion of the enemy
I’m going to see it in theater the day it comes out can’t wait
It’d be totally awesome if Jaime Lee Curtis shows up with a Myers mask on and the same clothing as Michael & kills him so he has to see what it’s like to be the victim of his own horror!!
The true king of Horror
Lmaooo should of left it alone
Karen's dressed and talks like she should be saying  "You want your mask?....." "EAT YOUR BREAKFAST!!"
That was a good movie .... nothing to see now......
You just know that whole group hunting down michael myres is gonna get picked of one by one
The concept of the whole town hunting down Michael is awesome.
Gonna be good but nothing will happen to Micheal because they got Halloween ends coming right after. Halloween ends is said to be the last but it’ll be the last of Laurie and Micheal going after each other. They won’t stop making Halloween
I love the fireFighter when they look at  Michael Myers will come out the House
The more he kills the more he transcends......FUCKING WHAT¿
I think Michael is going to die in the new Halloween movie
How to score a modern trailer: *BVVVVVVT!  BVVVVVVVVVVVVVT! BVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVT!!!!*  Now give me a million dollars.
Crime scene cleanup crew going to be busy
how the fuck they all let him kill them, not one of them was smart enough to snipe him or something, or bomb him or figure out his location or set a trap for him, mind going into circles  im built different ,he would not touch this
0:08  When you find a huge deadly poisonous spider at home, so you burn your house down then some asshole decides to call the fire department.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
Yaasss come through!!!
One man could kill Michael. All we have to do is say his name 5 times in the mirror and he will appear 😂..  CANDYMAN..
GOOSEBUMPS!!! I CANT WAIT!! 😍😍😍😍
Whatever happened to her son 🤔 from H20! And then all of a sudden she has a daughter!? With no explanation! Still looking forward to watching this one tho! it’s always better OG! Actors!
There a 12 kills in this trailer alone! That’s the average amount for a horror movie! James A Janisse is gonna have a big job to do!
Next 4 Month Was October 15 2021 It's Halloween Special day
♥️♥️♥️
Personally they showed to much in the trailer, i was already interested no matter what lol save the secrets universal! Lol
Loving how positive this comment section is Its going to be a great movie 🔪🔪
I love the new timeline, it's not as messy as the other ones.
SOMEONE PLS TELL ME HOW DID HE SURVIVE
N. H. II- Poems of Love 1-5, N. H. II- Poems of Joy 1-5, N. H. II- Poems of Hope 1-5, and N. H. II- Faithful Poems 1-5 are on YouTube, and you can see them for yourself if you want to.
Halloween , The Day He Woke?
Can't wait to see this film! Looks like it has some pretty cool kills that were not in the other previous installments.
I hate how the main scenes are given away in the trailers on movies these days. Smh
Pretty sick when im totally hoping he wipes out the entire town
50 days ladies and gentlemen. 50 days…
just get a freakin bazooka or RPG..
I wonder if those Silver Shamrock masks means that these movies are in the same continuity as Halloween III lol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
The fact nobody has a proper gun in America on this movie is surreal
I hope they remember to keep the fingers missing off his left hand that Laurie blew off in the last film!
My grandmother is right the boogie man is real
Seeing as no doubt it’ll be rated 18 in the U.K. cinemas. Knowing sadly I won’t get to watch this kills me 😢 like come on I’m just a year apart from getting to see it
I like how it’s a literal remake of Halloween 2, even taking place in a hospital and having the town riot. Such an original and creative idea for a sequel to a film that’s pretty much a note for note reshoot of the original Halloween.
I miss the old school masks this one makes his character seem so different
Being set on fire just gives Michael a power-up
If you notice that Halloween lasts more than 24 hours, you know Michael had escaped.
Halloween iii season of the witch 🧙‍♀️🎃💀
Michal: I always come back. Springtrap: hey that is my line
Am I the only one who’s rooting for Michael  Btw so annoyed with “come on do it” cliche
This trailer looks like it's basically the entire movie in a nutshell. Regretful, but not surprising that they couldn't build it up with any foreshadowing or creepy ambience. Tells me already this movie won't have the substance or deft handling of the original.
30 years from now   Laurie: "evil dies tonight"  Michael Myers: " Laurie i can't do this anymore I'm done!"
Oh, Shoot this looks good!!
Well, thats what you get for joining the volunteer fire department in Haddonfield.
Cello!!!!!!
I want a movie of michael Myers vs jason voorhess.
Plis Jason vs michael myers vs chucky
You thought this shit was gonna blow up 😂😂
I haven’t really watched all the films to understand this, but why is Micheal so strong? I mean the way he lifted the firefighter up with ease seems inhuman
Why Anthony Michael Hall is not in the trailer? 👎🏻😠
Jamie prob dies at the end of this trilogy in a sacrificial way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=5s
I hope Micheal never dies
How did i just know this this was 2 months ago god dammit!!!!!! Notifications!!!!!
Classic movie 🎥 for Halloween 🎃 never gets old.
Alert of movie mistake: Look at the middle of the light bulb at exactly 1:11, when he's holding it while moving in to stab the eldey woman. It's a prop with a sling action mechanism. I can't unsee it now. I'm also insanely pumped for this movie. Does any think the studio or creators realize that?
Tbh I would have jus died then and there once I saw the firetrucks coming to Michael's aid😂😂.
Why does he look like Biden in the thumbnail?
So ready for this ! 😩
Usher: I think that you should… Jamie Lee Curtis: LET IT BURN!!!!!🔥
Let It Burn.
i like michael how he looks like
After seeing the last Halloween film i wanted to blow my brains out on the wall i hated that god damn film i am sure this next one will suck ass also.
Jules 313 Michael Myers MM
I would love a 3D Halloween to take me back to my childhood, other than IMAX nature films, my last 3D horror was Friday the 13th Part 3, about 1983.  I'd love Micheal coming after me.
Se ve genial
I’m so excited for this film
I somehow didn’t know this existed this movie looks fire 🔥🔥🔥
This trailer makes Michael look like the hero going against an entire town after him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
my biggest fear, Michael is, yet he is my most fave movie character EVER! I watch Halloween movies all year long..October I become obsessed! LOL, I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS ONE!  Evil dies tonight...i dont think so 2021! Here we go :)
Rip Friday the 13th 1980-2009 holloween lives on
I really wish they didn’t end the saw trilogy. They were all so good. The old ones. The new ones aren’t the same like before. Looking forward to this one
Oh My God..
How tf does this have less views than candy man like wtf shame
yessssss yessssss omg
WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT THE SILVER SHAMROCK MASKS???
Why the fuck did they mess with the theme song
hopefully they dont turn this movie into a dumb ass liberal fest
"Evil dies tonight" But what about Halloween ends?
Finally a horror movie when the hunted become the hunter
I hate to be a buzzkill, but I think it will suck. Just my opinion.
Halloween kills   Halloween ends  Halloween comes back because the fans miss Michael Myers a lot 🤣🤣🤣
This is a must see for me…
"I prayed that he would burn in hell, but in my heart I knew that hell would not have him"
I felt like the 2018 didn't quite hit the mark but now I know this wasn't the end I am Hyped to see Halloweens Final Round somebody hit the bell This Match is about to Commence 🥳
Michael myers is the devil.
They played the whole movie there
The masks from Halloween 3!!!
i am comming for you michel  michel: oh iam scared.
Bro and there’s another fuckin one after this

How is it possible a few neighbors don’t get together with their ARs and dump like 60 rounds into him? The end. Right? Either way I do love these movies 🎃

Will Lauren or Allison die in this last Halloween movie this October does anybody know?
This movie (and the last one) proves that good to GREAT sequels can exist. Friday the 13th, nightmare on elm street, and Texas chainsaw massacre could learn a thing or two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
I didn’t really like the 2018 one but this looks good
IM SO EXCITED TO SEE THIS 😍😍
if you show myers without his mask ill be pissed.
I lowkey wonder why she didn’t just move far away to a different country or state. Of course, he’s gonna find you if you live in the same place right?
ESTÁ DE PUTA MADRE, ES MÁS SANGRIENTO Y MUY PARECIDO A HALLOWEEN 2 DE 1981. YA QUIERO VERLO
Would be cool and brilliant if as soon as he walks out through the door we see it from the point of view of the firemen as he kills everyone  only to the final victim who is impailed
No matter how many times I watch this..goosebumbs. Is it Hallow's Eve yet?
All the good parts already in the trailer LolWho needs to see the movie
I AM SO GOING TO SEE THIS THE DAY IT COMES OUT!!!!
This trailer Basically showed the whole thing
“If it can bleed, we can kill it.” -Arnold Schwarzenegger
“I am coming for you Michael” Oh please, the guy is a human tank for goodness sakes, killing him won’t solve anything he will rise again
Imagine if the town fails and Michael Myers kills a whole ass town💀💀
I’m sorry, but this looks dumb. I like the last one but we don’t need to do a whole new trilogy.
2:17. Michael is back 😗
Can we think of something new! It’s like these new gen writers can’t think. Like they allergic to originality
wooow
54 days
Damn he getting a lot of bloodpoints from that
I love the reference to the third movie with the masks very nice!
rip dr loomis
🤞🤞🤞👌👌👌
So which of the many preceding Halloween films do casual fans need to watch as the lead in to this sequel?
Laurie:evil dies tonight  Michael:oh no not this woman again isn't she like in her 40s
0:14 that remind me of: "LET IT BURRN!!" from "LET IT GO"
Just use Decisive Strike and Spine Chill and you're good. Oh... and do them gennys.
Why do I like so different its my mask or?
They need to hang this franchise up already and make a leprechaun or a Jason or a new Freddy smh
New age actors are unbelievably cringe worthy.
I’ll never support pedowood
I wouldn't watch this even if Jamie Lee Curtis came to my house and played it. Give it a bloody rest already. Its the same all the time. Maybe let's get luck and Jamie dies this time. Just END IT.
Lame
Ok hate to be that guy but wouldn't mike myers be like 80 years old by now? How physically menacing can he still be?
Halloween: The Rage Inside
John 3:16
svp je veux voir ce film dans un site gratuit !
You know it ain't going to be no happy Halloween stop playing
first of all without John Carpenter there will not be no Michael Myers you real Halloween fans who created the character apparently you ain't wash the old movie has caught original b****
I AM SO EXITED FOR THIS !
1:13
Please make a Friday the 13th movie
Michael immortality is not gone yet
Wowwwww 🏆🏆🔥🔥
YES
That scene with the firefighters......That scene fucking hurts.
YOOOO THE CHAINSAW PART WAS FIRE
That floating, tilted walk that Michael has is just horrifying
I just keep wanting more and more keep it up John Carpenter
Hell yeah fukin excited I can't wait Michael Myers never dies hell yeahhow could you compare a classic this is John Carpenter's work
I just wish they would let michael finally get her and her daughter especially her daughter because she is annoying
Should be fun watching a woman in her 60s fighting her brother also in his 60s wearing a star trek mask that has held up surprisingly well for being over 40 years old. Laurie be sure to eat your Activia before you battle your brother.
They fucked up the song. It sounded scary before and now it just sounds weird and not in a good way.
SMART looking film
it's a good thing those firefighters showed up when they did or we'd have gotten a freddy movie instead
HOT DAMNN. ........This looks like it's going to be the shytz!!
looks like michael's not so shy now
Love it, can’t wait till it comes out. Wow it’s going to be badass. I love all these Halloween movies trilogy. Amazing 🤩
Wait a minute...are those the Silver Shamrock masks? Does this mean Silver Shamrock is officially part of Michael's universe now? Is David Gordon Green just fucking with us?
This trailer raises the hair on the back of my neck . The scene in the back of the truck is acadamy award stuff. OH NO! NO ! NO !  LET HIM BURN ! LET HIM BURN !!  Nightmare movie comin at ya !! Be ready for it but you know you wont be .😵😵😵😵😵
“I’m not gonna sit and watch another innocent person die again!”  Michael: Well yes but actually no
Appearently it's really hard to kill one guy who has a butcher knife Or maybe there making it look hard, for you know MONEY!
I hope there are a lot of kills because this showed many of them
I *wait for it* CONIC
I feel bad and sad for the fireman who died and they are just doing there job to stop the fire
LETS GOOO
Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, and Klaus Schwab come to mind...
Che figo!😎
Yooo I'm excited.. I can't wait to watch this movie but I do have one complaint I just wish they would've kept the music the same because it sounds like a rock and roll song now  but other than that I look forward to watching this💯 #Michael Myers fan
Yo I’m excited
Ur morbid face...
I CANT WAIT 💞💞💞💞🔥‼️
Should’ve thrown the pallet down 🤦
Oh myyy i watch thisss
Halloween Kills Comes Out October 14 And Halloween Ends Comes Out October 15 2022
Halloween Kills Comes Out October 14 And Halloween Ends Comes Out October 15 2022 don't think Halloween is gonna end next year
Micheal 20 years later would kill but he has a walker and glasses
I just can't wait for  "Halloween Ends" in 2022!!!
The more killing the better
I can't wait!
Omg he’s never gonna die
AWWWW, COME ON! I THOUGHT WE WERE DONE!!!! I COULDA' SWORE WE WERE DONE!!! JOHN CARPENTAR SAID WE WERE DONE, WITH THE LAST 'HALLOWEEN' MOVIE!!! WE AREN'T DONE, YET!?!?  BAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH-HA-HA-HA-HA!!!! "HALLOWEEN"!!! IT NEVER ENDS, NEVER!!! MICHAEL MYERS KEEPS COMING BACK, JAMIE LEE CURTIS KEEPS COMING BACK, JOHN CARPENTAR KEEPS COMING BACK!!!! WE WILL NEVER BE DONE!!! JOHN CARPENTAR: "THIS IS THE LAST 'HALLOWEEN', EVER. I AM SICK OF MY CAREER BEING DEFINED BY MY FIRST FILM!"  NO IT ISN'T, CARPENTAR, YOU FILTHY IMMORTAL HIPPIE!!! AS LONG AS MICHAEL MYER'S UNDEAD ASS KEEPS MAKING MONEY, YOU'LL NEVER GET SICK OF THIS!! AAAAAAAAAAGGGHHH!!
Can't wait  classic thriller  of all times
Okay sooo michael doesn’t die in this one because on Instagram halloweenmovie the directors post a short video in 2019 after first movie where they saying that saga isn’t ove and that in october 16th 2020 Halloween kills which its delay to this year and october 15th 2021 Halloween Ends so maybe another year we gonna have last Halloween film
If  Laurie Strode spent the last 40 years training to kill Michael Myers and she fails and he goes on to kill more people she sucks! She should move into an apartment building in the hood where he’ll get robbed and murdered  before he makes it to the second floor.
"Evil Dies Tonight!!" Michael Myers: 2021! ..I'm Still Killin' Biotch!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
Guarantee you Laurie is just sick of this shit already lmao
น่าดูมากกกกก
Laurie Strode: " He's the essence of evil" Jason Todd: "Evil can't be cured. Only killed."
Ok but does the guy with the mask look like Joe Biden
Fireman grab my hand am here to rescue you.. Shit dude your the one it needs rescued, can't wait for this and Halloween ends next year which would of been this year lol Like how the town ate going to hunt him and probably lose
Might as well release the damn movie now. The trailer basically spoiled the whole damn thing.
Yaaa this looks like shit.
ABSOLUTELEY LOVE the halloween season of the witch reference with the silver shamrock masks at 1:32
This is going to be a good move 😭😭😭
Damnnnn bro, Way to show the whole movie
I'm so glad Halloween 2018 turned out fantastic because with John Carpenter at the helm, we can have a seriously good trilogy on our hands.  The original is one of the best horror movies ever made and the 2018 reboot/sequel captured the same essence that made the original a classic.  Michael is gonna finally get the treatment Jason and Freddy never got.
50 years later, Halloween: The Great Reset.
Hes mortal...yet he acts and moves like hes immortal hes 60 odd plus...i hope we dont see his face..that should be kept untold.
I would like to see them bring back josh hartnett into one of these films. Laurie strodes forgotten son.
Looks pretty bad, not that the first part of this reboot was any good but im setting my expectations low.
Dumb violent crap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=6s
All Halloween movies with Jamie Lee Curtis are the best, except that "resurrection" crap.
The new movies going to be awesome it's going to be the highest grossing horror in cinematic history  bring it on Michael Myers
so in a nutshell, it’s a tier 3 michael
Too much spoiler in this trailler
He Looks Like The Milkman from Fear Street
LETS see his FACE
Personally i would've made THIS the last halloween movie, one final stand.
Wait Do people actually think this looks good?
Hadi bakim kafa kafaya Laurie vs Michael izleyelim
This is gonna be good
No way was that Tommy Doyle
This a good moment to play "Guess who is back" song.
John carpenter deff doing it bigger than the original and deff better than the last. Real master of horror!
The body count is going to be crazy. This is John carpenter he deff doing it better than the last n the originals. Real master of horror.
And we have a third coming??? Let's goooo!!!!!
Bruh who let him get third tier
Bold prediction. Best one in the franchise, and the one after will not be as good. Just seems like this movie has the opportunity to go full throttle because of the set up alone. The next one will hopefully wrap everything up nicely but I think for "kills" sake, no pun intended. This is it. Should be crazy
Killing firefighters...... That is most disrespectful, most genius, and underrated movie scene idea, I've seen all my life.... But why firefighters :(
This is going to be epic on all levels
Michael Myers for life 💪👍
The last film of this trilogy should be called ‘Halloween Better End Tonight’ instead of Halloween ends.
The scenes with Micheal are great but then keeps cutting back the the most annoying women on the planet, seems like more feminist claptrap that has no place in a horror movie.
Anyone else notice the silver shamrock masks from "Halloween: Season of the Witch" in the trailer?...
The mask didn't melt?
How many times can you remix the same story?...
Lauries grand daughter gets her whole school to fight Michael Michael: you’re just making my job easier
Everyone wants Michael to died.
So if this takes place after the very first Halloween, which is also called Halloween?, and they're making 2 more, technically it would be a quadrilogy and not a trilogy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
He killed a kid in the last one and he kills two elderly folks in this one.
Those firefighters never stood a chance.
Idk how he’s still alive but I am so glad he is
Everyone needs to stop commenting for once lol
Movie overrated
Movie overrated lol
What is the crowd chanting?
"Evil dies tonight." *proceeds to release plans for a sequel*
an homage to bastard child of the series -- Halloween iii -- the the silver shamrock masks..... nice touch
DUDE NO WAY, i completely loved the 2018 movie and A FUCKING SEQUEL? omg.
I am definitely going to see this
they just showed us every kill in the movie
Yall done really pissed Micheal off
I need too stop making these movies. It’s like scream, just let it end or reinstall a new cast or something, I’m over watching old people in horror movies
Although I love the franchise I'm very disappointed it's not what it used to be I wish I could help make Halloween movies trust me trust me it would be fire I have such creative ideas
Nice reference to the silver shamrock masks there
Minchia..!! È il numero 1 ♥️
59 MORE DAYS
Damn poor those fire fighters
続編嬉しいより結局死んでねえのかよ感が強い
Now I'm rooting for this film harder now that Venom 2 is also coming out October 15th..🎃🗡 #OctoberBelongsToMichaelMyers
Remember Tommy you said yourself you can't kill the boogeyman.
Damn, looks like they are going with a more action horror approach here. I really liked the last movie, so I'm curious how they will do this. I'm guessing by the trailer, the hunter has become the hunted, but Michael ain't one to roll over. Looking forward to this, though I am cautiously optimistic
I cannot friggin wait
Kind too dramatic for my tastes but alright I guess.
They shouldnt have tried to kill Michael with a fire axe or saw they shouldve used the high pressure hose
Soy el único que piensa que las películas están volviendo hacer como antes .osea como el 2015 ,2016,2017,2018 :)
classic horror line "Its over, he's dead" or can't hurt anyone again. To which you immediately know, he's alive and he'll hurt many more lol
Imagine if the knife Laurie has at the end of the trailer was the one micheal had in the original movie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
Actually Michael doesn't die tonight because there is another movie coming…
If you see Myers walking out of fire it’s not pretty 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This looks excellent !
To me the only two i ever saw was Halloween 1978 and Halloween 2018 loved both i heard all the other ones were crap but i think they should just keep 78 and this trilogy cannon and end it on a high note while they can
Cannot wait to see 1 v 1 an entire town
Three dead people wearing Silver Shamrock's masks at the playground:  1:32-1:34 Two of them at the roundabout; the one wearing jack-o'-lantern mask with Silver Shamrock's badge seen from behind, and the other wearing skull's mask  1:37 The latter wearing witch's mask is hung by the chain from the swing.  That's a good easter egg from Halloween III: Season of the Witch who is not connected to any of the franchise though.
If I could make the last Halloween movie this is how the script would go. So basically the film would start off after the last Halloween he's still alive he kills off a shit ton of people and basically everyone is freaking out. They all get sick and tired of it to the point that the feds get involved. It's been going on for so long why haven't the feds gotten involved? So they are shooting him from choppers and he falls over they are crying in relief the whole town got involved to stop the madness but wait ....  The fucker gets back up slowly. The whole town come together and shove him in a van crazy fighting he's throwing people off of him but they finnaly get him in there. On the way to the cell they'll place him in he manages to fuck up the car ride there and they just keep recapturing him they finally get him in a cell. And they call all people to expierence his electric chair sentence you get to see his face reveal. But he doesn't die even when they keep turning up the wattage. So they make a specific box in the middle of town that is see through and every single day they give the town permission to torture him in hopes that one day someone will be able to kill him off. The government occasionally shows up and do testing on him to see if there's a way they could recreate his cells to make it where people can live forever but in the midst of doing that they acciedntly create a group of people that are just like him and then they break him out and those people are the devil's rejects lol
Three ladies raped Michael, now it's Michael's turn to rape them back.
Am I the only one that is really excited to see Kyle Richards as Lindsey
🔥
GIVE'M HELL MICHAEL !! GIVE'M HELL !! Stupendously awesome movie . GO SEE IT WHEN IT'S RELEASED . The scenes in the trailer are mild compared to the rest if them folks. Get ready for true horror.
Should of kept the original theme song
Comment section is god level 😂
Im in!!
We should just let Michael kill every single human on Earth, just to see what he does after that.
I will go see it yay
I've been waiting for a sequel for 3 years ... Finally, my destiny will come true
تبغى ستور
just nuke him
I’ve been waiting for this😁
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
LETS GO MICHAEL
October 15th fellas its coming out
Fucking hell . Am going to watch it  First day first show
I said he escaped off camera when I seen 2018 film. I own the whole collection on blu ray. Fav slasher of all time
This is going to be a gas.
"YOU WANT YOUR MASK? COME AND GET IT!" Micheal:"MOMMY SHE TOOK MY MASK WAAAAAAA"
"We're gonna need the National Guard (to take care of Michael Myers") -James Gordon
I dont understand why everybody is afraid of Michael Myers, hes cute.
O yeah... Jason has NOTHING on Myers. can't wait to watch!!
Michael Myers isn't dead
All this because he didn’t get to trick or treat
Laurie: "Evil dies tonight"!   Michael: "Hold my knife". 🔪
I sense sjw
Nice, the final installment of the Halloween series!   ….until next time!: *Halloween Kills, Again*
Guess whos back Back again Michaels back Tell a friend Guess whos back Guess whos back Guess whos back Guess whos back Guess whos back
michael myers is similar to Akakabuto
So what happened to Josh Hardnetts character? I know they didn’t forget she had a son
Michael vs the world
im so ready for the movie
Thanks for showing me the whole film 🍿
The hunter is hunted
How much XP, does Michael Myers have @ this point? 😂
How does he comeback from getting his head chopped off from the last movie 🍿 🤦🏽
Laurie needs a bigger knife
1:33 THEYRE TYING IN HALLOWEEN 3 INTO THIS????
venom is going to loose
So it’s just Micheal versus the whole Lobby basically
I wonder if the entire town will arm up to fight him
this trailer showed me way too much of the movie lol
Oh hey the Halloween 3 masks. Neat.
GOD That Violin style of the OG theme just sends chillls down my spine. I’m SOO Hyped for this next Chapter in the Halloween Series!!!!
Would Michael just kill Jamie lee curtis already. Shit
Looks good 👍
Those Halloween 3 masks tho
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
All you have to do is throw some Drones in the air to find his location and use basic military tactics to get rid of Micheal. Honestly he'd be gunned down in about sixty-seconds if people had the means and tried. Even he he doesn't die he isn't going to function with his limbs and eye blown off.
Michael should be on the beach enjoying his vacation but oh well I guess it's time to kill again 😆. Ahhh shi+ here we go again
Can’t wait for this one better be as good as the last one
This will be the perfect Halloween scare film this fall!
Wow, I love it, my best movie
You cannot kill Michael, with or without his mask he gonna kill you
Let's be honest when she said a man couldn't survive that fire we all thought of Halloween II
this version of the halloween theme with the cello kicks ass. easily the best version. Baffles me it took this long for someone to think of it.
is there a new movie or something?
please stop making Halloween movies. The horse you’re beating has been dead for like 25 years
Suh-weeeet
they showed way too many death scenes in this trailer
We don't deserve this movie. It looks great going to be a fuckin slaughter fest! No matter if it's Jason freddy Chucky or whoever none can compete with Myers
oh god cant hollywood let anything die gracefully?
Can't wait to see this one lol😼
Michael Myers in my opinion is the closest depiction to the boogeyman we have. He’s surpassed Freddy, Chucky and Jason.
Scene Not Safe! Scene Not Safe!
Michal Myers had enough time. He was hunting the girls, now time for the girls to hunt him
“Evil Dies Tonight” Me an Intellectual: Actually seeing as there is supposed to be another Halloween movie evil dies next year.
65 days
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=4s
if Michael dies I will be so pissed the fucking main characters have no chance and yet they somehow manage to win, this is bulllsht epically when children dont die
Nossa! eu quero muoto assistir esse filme. É perfeito!
Aw shiet the tier iv michael
😱 I cannot believe Mike Myers is still alive in the house of fire!
There's life and there's death Michael is in between he's basically a demon thats been living in that body for like fifty odd years
YESSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh how the turn tables do turn...
Man they're really maing the old sequels look like shit.
Someone else notice Alison being stab or maybe killed at the end of the trailer?!?
Oh look, another AC/DC album…. No wait, i mean ANOTHER Halloween movie…🙄
You will always have its fan base, no matter how many Halloween movies are made. This has been going on since 1978. Can't wait!!
Oh cool. Another reboot, remake, repeat.
They had to find a way to bring him back my god, when will it end
Laurie: evil dies tonight  Michael: yeah yeah yeah blah blah blah listen woman are we gonna do this cause I got places to be and people to kill and your holding up the line
I watched 30 sec, and i'm gonna wait to it's relase in cinema, the trailer is 2:30 long, it's gonna show the whole damn movie  plot. i'm waiting! who else?
Fuckkk Yeaaa.
I'm not liking the idea of this film it seems like it will lose its horror elements.
He shows up kills everyone, cant be killed, jacks off in a pumpkin.We get it same shit that happened in the first 8 movies
i just want laurie strode gone.
OMG. I'M SO EXCITED 😆
Not sure if im gonna like seeing myers get handcuffed in flashbacks
So I've basically seen the movie now
Will definetely be seeing this on opening night
All this never happened!! They are blowing it all up again!! I'm really a nice guy......
Halloween Kills: "evil dies tonight" Halloween Kills *Michael Myers dies in the end...but we don't see it*  5 Months Later  .......fasten your seatbelts....Michael's Backkkkkkkk  This looks good....but when does it get to a point when all tension is burned to a crisp and any and all impact is gone. I truly feel this should be the final Halloween movie. They've been on a fairly long and lucky streak with some good films...but after Kills...the tension, realistically....should be gone. You don't feel any sense of relief or victory for the protagonists in the end, because you know "they didn't show it...so there's got to be MORE". There's just no impact, when you know there's just gonna be another. It also makes the plot/formula VERY predictable. Some local murders happen, main character gears up, tries to fight it a few times, gets called crazy or fails a few times, end battle, 1v1 or 2v1 or 3v1, and then Michael dies....but we don't see it. That's just the whole formula.  This movie looks good, and like it will be enjoyable, like the previous film...but this has to be the end. Since it feels this will involve the town, maybe have the whole town come together and in the end, have everyone watching as Michael Myers finally dies, and Laurie, along with her others there too...the end.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=177s
Is this the last Halloween
Love it but the finale is not going to be it… Halloween Ends is actually just the beginning and it won’t actually end till there’s been like 31 of them.
I really wish that trailers would stop showing so much of the movies' key plot points, it kinda ruins all element of surprise.
This goin be good
Jamie/Laurie: Evil dies tonight!!!  Michael: haven't you seen my other films, I don't die
Dude. I'm not even done watching the trailer and I'm so hyped. Michael is an absolute unit of destruction.
They already spoiled the twist. Michael is a member of the police department. How else can you explain him killing innocent black people.
I don't like that the firefighters die. I will not watch
So who else is ready to see him on a life alert commercial
So many good movies this year  Dont breath  2 Halloween kills Scream 5 apparently
cant wait
Im hyped
I like the Halloween 3 masks at 1:33.
Ain't no fckin way ima sit there n let Michael Myers get his 1 Ons w/ the homies we jumping that nigga we goin from Firefighters to the Firing Squad
I feel kinda Bad for him, when Laurie took off his Mask.. it Was just pissing him off. He will get always a New mask. But k
I just reliazed that in every michael myers movie, michael gets beaten up.
When this comes out I will watch the 1978 original and I'll have a blast.
yah buddy
What's the next film Halloween once again 😂
Can’t wait. Absolutely love this film and the originals that came before, however, this is becoming way too similar to the dreadful Fast and Furious movies.   “One last ride”   “Evil dies tonight”   Next year, new film 😂
Is she Carol?
I’m always up for shitty sequels but this is too much.
İnşallah Türkiye’de çıkar 👍
This looks good, but I really hope the shot at 0:36 isn't a final finished shot. It looks absolutely terrible.
The nutritious horse lilly breathe because arch usually prevent vice a scandalous tub. wasteful, friendly palm
*Shot the brain...*
All because they're going to take the "let's jump him" route. I am so hyped for this movie.
“ grandma”
Stop making halloween movies, they suck. Seriously the cow is over the skinned to the bone and its tits are shriveled up.
Looks lame
Laurie will always be my favorite final girl
That fire fighter falling through the floor is gonna change everything because there was no way out for Michael and would’ve burned to death eventually Laurie was right when she said let it burn for a reason
I only kill demons, but he close enough
krl, deu mó gastura quando ele enfiou a lâmpada na garganta da veia, coitada 😥!!!! 1:07
He’s basically prestige master after this one
I’m so excited for this!!! Can we all agree that the soundtrack used in this trailer is 🔥🔥
oh stop !
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
I was so surprised to see Micheal survive that fire October 2021 this is released
*When you realize HALLOWEEN KILLS should be Halloween: H40*  Dam I'm old
Michael Myers is the legend of all Halloween
They need to cut Jamie Lee out of these movies so overdue
Michael myers is the goat
When it come out
Myers in the 2018 version was scratch mirror myles.  The 2021 Myers is the Infinite tier 3 Myers.
If you put a womans wig on Michael Myers it will look like Mariah Carey
I want Laurie to get killed by Michael tbh
1:33 OMG H3'S MASKS
At least the soundtrack will be great.
I really thought the last one was it! Wew!! That was close, can't wait 4 this, Michael Kill'em All.
Not even 1/100 as scary as the original. It's the only thing keeping Curtis relevant and she doesn't care if she sh*ts all over the franchise in order to stay there.
_(sigh)_
Laurie" "Evil dies tonight"  Me who knows everyone is contractually obligated to make a 3rd one: -_-
This Movie is October 14 the next movie Halloween ends is October 15 2022
The only thing that scares me is this man. That face..
I’m going to watch this everyday until this movie comes out lol
Hell Yeah! Halloween my favorite
Not a reboot people 2018 halloween is direct sequel to original so this is more of the night of 2018
Lmao @ "Michelle Luckett!" 🤣💀
Micheal: I'm stronger. Now.. You're MINE!   Jason: NARUTOOOO  Micheal: SASUKEEEE
Vaistinu majkl
Love the subtle nods to all the prior Halloweens: Continuing in the hospital from 2, the town mob from 4, its going to be epic!!
I think the scene where he walks out the house,  not a flame on him and how cool he spins the weapon around into his other hand and all the firefighters are just looking in disbelief that a "man" has just walked out of a blazing house - i would say is probably going to be one the BEST and more eery scenes of the whole movie!
v excited
I can’t wait for this shit I’m at the theater for this hell yeah Michael do your shit mannn🔥🔥🔥🔥
You know it’s good because Jamie Lee Curtis is in it because the script has to be good or she wouldn’t do it
A bazooka would end all of this in a jiffy...
When he said that's a straight line to Michael's childhood home I said ha prove he always walks in a straight line
In the older movies wasn’t Micheal the deity of a cult that kept reviving him every time he died
続編来たー！！
POV: Michael Myers unlocked Life Steal
Man I am very very brutal and killing I get better and better every day
At what point do you just abandon and cordon off the town?
Oh boy another good sequel im so excited
I think john wick will kill the buggy man
Infinite tier 3 Judith tombstone myers
I am waiting for this movie I love this movie
I like how theres even a reference to Halloween III Season of the Witch in this one
This reminds me of John wick 3 The whole town go against one person
Big Mike gained a little pep in his step, no? My mans almost hit a little light jog around that swing @ 1:46 😐
basicly farming kills for exp
I wish they could create a series for Halloween.
Michael is coming for the anti-vaxxers
The trailer is bad ass
This trilogy will destroy any 3 Halloweens combined..I am so stoked
Oea weee that right there might be the best Halloween yet...
I love Jaime so much
I feel like I’ve watched this trailer and the teaser so much I’ve figured the film out and can’t wait to see if I’m right 😂 here’s my theory  Karen is killed and that scene of Laurie holding the knife is the final scene where she says I’m coming for you Michael cliff hanger for ENDS    I think Laurie (who won’t be in action) Allyson and Lindsey will be the only survivors, just don’t feel like they are gonna put majorly characters deaths in the trailer  Ie Lindsey, Tommy, karen, Laurie  and Allyson. So them showing Lindsey getting grabbed by Michael isn’t her death  Tommy and Karen’s death will be just before the final scene and they will be heavy  Karen will stab Michael and grab his mask, he will chase her, this will lead to Tommy’s death karen will go back to Allyson and that’s when she is killed in front of Allyson  Allyson is going to end up being as traumatised as Laurie by the next film, I’ve heard that now they are going to have a time jump in Ends so I think they’ll deal with Laurie and allysons trauma
Safe to say I cannot fucking wait 🥺
These last 2 movies are gonna be the most brutal of them all
seems like he hasn't died in past 20 years... this franchise is so OLD zzzzz
So,the trailer was awesome but the shot of Michael leaving the burning when it zooms on his face looks awful,like wtf  everything else looks amazing but that little bit around 0:40
The hallowomen return
hate kyle she's a nobody
i think i found skid and pump
I wish Laurie was hard like that when she had Jamie she literally abandoned Jamie left her in Haddonfield with that murderer  and that murderer was trying to kill Jamie when she was a little girl ,when Jamie grew up she had a baby of her own but at least she hid her baby before she got killed so that that murderer wouldn't get to her child .... I give her props she protected her child before she got murdered ..
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=8s
Just fucking confirm he's super natural already.
As usual the trailer ruins it by showing everything! 😑
I god damn love Judy Greer
This actually makes sense how he survived. Just hid in the gun locker & then bailed out by Haddonfield FD
Do anyone know when is this coming out please comment please yall
cant wait
When my sister told me about this movie I was like "reboot or soemthing else"but holy shit this is fucking cool like this SHOULD be the finale movie of all the series. I think this because well they removed his dam mask. Ik ik you be like "bro wtf thats not a good reason" but it truely is as his mask is his shell the shell that hides the man behind the slaughter the human behind the devil. If they do make another movie after this im ganna be big sad. But one thing I can cruises is how is Jason V's long lost bro clothes not on fire? Bitch was in that mofo for about 12? 13? 5? Idk. But I could let this off as fire stunts are VERY dangerous. But overall this is going ti be amazing kills story,acting,and everything. Hollywood and film guys don't fuck the ending of this beautiful series.
Hell.... yesss I can't believe it they are maken another one f yess man I can't wait cant wait . I'm one huge fan of this an I watch all of the old ones every year around Halloween an plus it's my b-day but yes this is regina be good an I hope it's better than the last one . It already seems that way but definitely cant wait so excited 🤘 I love so scary movies a big horror fan of everything scary
bruh, this aint even real, they're actors, they really thought we'd believe this is real huh? there's been no reports on michael myers anywhere, this is so obviously faked
Wow. OK. Dumbfounded. It certainly looks waaaaaaaaaaaay better than the first reboot.... Should I give this franchise one more chance?!...
Michael Myers is killing people and we don't know why.
Johnwick vs michael myers pls
I do love the mob mentality. I do feel like it steps away from the mysterious appearance and disappearance of Michael aspect of the films. But, it does have a bit of a callback to Halloween 4, on a much bigger scale. Still, it’s good to see Michael still treated like a supernatural force.
Welp they js spoiled the movie but I still wanna see it 😂🤚🏾
Unfortunately you already have a pothole. The police have to secure a scene before firefighters will show. There would be several police in the area. And those police would have easily dispatched and handled the threat.
Michael Myers - Tyler Mane, otherwise I quit.
Why are there protestors in Halloween kills
Gonna ignore how those dumbass firefighters just stood there as they watched the others get murdered?
I really can’t wait to this movie come out 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
There never going to stop making these.  It's just like the Friday the 13ths theres how many now come on. Hollywood needs NEW HORROR FACES. THESE ARE STUCK IN THE 70S AFTER ZOMBIES IT SHOULD'VE KILLED HIM OFF. BUT HEY IM NOT A DIRECTOR 🤨🤨🤨😁
How to kill Michael Myers: Give him a CPAP machine
I cannot wait to see this in theatres. It's gonna be a crazy experience
Killer is back
Such a short running time tho for a long trailer :/ 108 mins. Hoping for a directors cut. Love the idea though this barrier of this entire series never been done.
LETS GOOOO
Did michael  kill  the baby
Hey! The Halloween masks from Halloween 3!...Just me? Okay...
The only thing that will kill Michael Myers is Covid! Get a mask on that SOB!
am i the only one who wants michael to win? HAHA
Can't wait to see this movie!
I wonder if Michael will get his mask back from that lady. Probably
Bring back Nick Castle!!
Totally thought Jamie Lee Curtis was Carol from TWD
Its Micheal Myers vs the Town🤣
I'd like too see Danny Mcbride tackle Nightmare On Elm Street after this series. Make a new horrorverse. But I'd rather see Michael vs Jason or Pinhead vs Freddy. Jason got merked in FvJ. Even the end Freddy winked. Jason was dreaming.
Can’t wait to see the movie
1:17 "stop, you had a knife in your stomach"  That line delivery....
I love how they included Halloween III's mask
Micheal To Laurie: cmon. Me and you both know you can’t kill my ass.
Halloween series is all right but I'm still more of a fan of Friday The 13th series
Michael Myers and Purge Crossover make it happen
dam this trailer shows you the whole dam movie sheeeeesh!
Why’d Karen act all clueless when the sheriff told her Michael Myers is alive, did she forget seeing all the fire trucks en route to extinguish the fire? They shoulda turned the truck around and told the firemen that Michael was in the house and to let it burrrrrnnn
Where can I buy Halloween kills merch?
this one is kinda scary compared to the others ngl
Love that scene with a Halloween 3 feeling! Kills ass!
Michael went on a rampage
Just leave him alone!!!!!!!!!!
This looks so worth the wait but I feel like we have a couple spoilers here that we could have done without.
Feels like the film trailer pretty much shows all the killings so guess it’s not worth watching. How many more Halloween films? 🤦🏻‍♂️
Jamie: I'm coming for you! Michael: what else is new sis?
Fuck This is going to be good!!!!!!
So how is Jamie not tired of Michael after 43 damn years 😭 I would just die!
Michael Myers is back
This movie looks fucking stupid
i cant be the only one smiling while he kills
1:46
(1:09) looks damn like the lady from the cemetery in pt.1.   Pause and match the nose piercing🧐
@1:28 ain't that the (sexy) nurse that was getting into a car in the 1st film during the steadicam scene?
Anyone think Michael just needs a nice home cooked meal? Remember he went into the psych ward when he was 5. The fucker didn't know how to cook. Then he got out and made like what 20 movies now. He was eating cats and some beans or whatever. Michael Myers might just need some good ol fashioned country style cooking.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Myers seems pretty strong... where does he work out?  And.. where does he live?  What does he do on his birthday?  Does he have bad breath?  Where does he buy his food?  Is he... vegan now?   Ahhhh – so many questions!
This music is sick
Fun fact (but also SPOILER)  Didn't you notice that the 2 corpses on the turnstile (1:32) are familiar ? :)  This is the black couple Myers stared at in the first movie (the sexy nurse and the doctor with blue suit). Here's the link to the scene of the first movie (starting from 2:14 ) :   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy2kMtJa2q8&t=151s  The director already doomed these poor guys since the first movie... BRILLIANT :p
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
Honest I'm being honest that was good like how the hell you didn't get that on on October Halloween Michael Myers returns now I ❓
Can’t wait for it to be in theatre’s October 15th! Can’t come any faster
I'm sure the ambulance medics could hear her
OMG IM SO EXCITED FOR THE MOVIE TO COME OUT :D
Oh man im excited for this
Why
Oh, wow. That looked fucking amazing.
Hey love this trailer cant wait for the movie to come
Why do these movies always come out when I’m at Disney
I knew they would make another 🤦‍♂️ they need more box office money
Can’t wait to watch it
Iom think I have never sat thru a halloween (michael myers) movie
HOW?!😳😳
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
has halloween 2 vibes..looks awesome.
Michael Myers is not Human.    -By, me
OMG NOOO I HATE THAT FIREFIGHTERS! HOW THEY EVEN WENT THERE? LIKE- WTF!
I figured out why Michael Meyers can't die. Something has to keep Jamie Lee Curtis's career alive.
I already seen this movie Halloween kills early it's the best
Omg this looking amazing
That mask is fucken amazing the more damage the more history I think sadly this will be the end of Halloween
imagine this how the movie ends.  Michael Myers is seen walking down a Dark Road Which Says “Welcome To Crystal Lake”  And before the scene ends to roll the credits, You hear the Iconic “Ki ki ki, ma ma ma”   This would lead to Michael Myers Vs Jason Voorhees, In a Epic show down of to Icons i. horror slasher films.
I almost looked up the release date for this lmao
Damn, I was almost sure that Michael was going to put on the fire fighter's outfit and walk out of the house blending in
blodbath be bloody hunt31 october rate back marry on haddonfield fall rain blod mr sandmansanheim cant wait be genius movie more kills feed blood fear MICHAEL MYERS BACK HOME XOXO
Holy shit man
So when's the next Helloween movie after this one, they just seem to be never-ending
He ain't playing in this one!!!!
Yasssssss
I cant Wait until October 15th
At this point in the series he’s tier 3
The first remake in 2018 involving John Carpenter had a lot of potential. The details and continuity in the movie were PERFECT!!!! ..........but the story and cast was a complete let down. I'm sure this one will be the same. I say this being a true Halloween 1978 fan since the mid-1980s. I even own an original first printing of the Halloween 1978 movie poster. My all-time favorite movie! I wanted the 2018 remake to be great, but it just wasn't.
A lynch mob's gonna save the day
What's the release date for the movie
I’m back baby
AT THIS POINT HE IS INVINCIBLE , LETS HAVE ANOTHER FREDDY VS. JASON WHERE FREDDY WINS THIS GO ROUND. THANK YOU ! TIRED OF SEEING OLE JAMIE LEE CURTIS
They have another Movie After this 😭😭
If I see Michaels face ima cry
Should’ve called this movie Halloween manhunt.
Wouldnt Michael be in his 70's now? Why is he so strong? He's literally a senior citizen. Also, I love how no one ever has a gun.
1:33 is no one gonna talk about the Halloween 3 masks
"Let's hunt him down."  1:43 Michael: "Say again?"
Are we going to see Michael face
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
The fireman scene, I hope isn't as retarded as it looks in the trailer, they have Michael out numbered, they're out in the open and they expect me to believe they don't either run away or just rush him all at once but instead come at him one at a time giving Michael more than enough opportunities to take them out.
No but like I’ve watched it so many times already
Wow.. That was basically the entire movie..
I don't know about you but I'm hungry for some DEAD MEAT
Guys, Micheal is just mad that he doesn’t have any good cosmetics in Dbd. So he’s going on a rampage for it.
this has Walking Dead vibe somehow
Laurie Strode: Evil dies tonight. Michael Myers: Cap
to those who keep wondering if Michael Myers is human, he is not. He's like Jason. If you watch Halloween 4 and 5, you'll see that when the little girl Jamie; Michael's niece, touches his hand, there was some kind of power or soul transferred to her from Michael and Jamie later killed her sister just like Michael killed his sister when he was young. So yea this dude is some kind of supernatural evil. How he became that is a mystery though cause we all saw him as a little boy. Some shit must have happened.
This is America best horror film🅿️
"The more he kills, the more he transcends.".... Boy is going for that platinum, bro is about to have mad skins after fucking that entire town up and we know damn well he will cause they're already working on the next Halloween for 2022 lol...
man this woman has been doing Halloween movies since the last 70s....and she keeps going lol
omg my bae
So does this mean that this movie also takes place on November 1st?
this comes out a day before my birthday lol
im so ready for this movie
Me and the wife are definately going to see this!!!!!!!!!!!!!
*Michael Myers finally dies* The Devil: Ight i'm out.
"Evil dies tonight"  I really hope so. These Halloween sequels were boring 5 movies ago. Now its just pathetic and became its own parody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
Anyone else think he’s a tad bit more angrier than last time? 😅
How many times will the same woman kill the same guy? And more importantly, how many times will people see the same story again and again?
This movie is a sequel to Halloween 2018 and Halloween 2018 is a sequel to Halloween 1978 cutting out Halloween 1,2,3,4,5,resurrection,h20 This movie is gonna be epic Happy Halloween Michael
I like how at the beginning of the trailer it picks up where the last film left off
I love how this film does not go with the original 90's films. My boy mikey still strong af! 3 months until October 2021! Who's hyped?
I love the music it has almost a AC/DC attached to it and places I really like it now they just need to make it a soundtrack
2:17  Allyson; "Do it. DO IT!!!"  Myers is like; "You think I won't?"
Finally after 3 years
Sorry but the only thing with the firefighters, they wouldn’t have gone inside that house trust me..that would’ve been surround and drown. No firefighter is going to go in an old two story fully involved house and try to search it
LETS HUNT HIM DOWN.   MICHAEL: LET ME GET MY KNIFE 1 SEC....👺🗡
THE TRUEST OF EVIL IS NOT WHAT WE CAN SEE..  BUT ITS THOSE WHO WALK QUIETLY AMONGST US IN THE SHADOWS.
Laurie: evil dies tonight.!!  Michael : it's 2021 and I'm offended and will need to go to my safe space
Halloween are the best movies 💨
I hope it's still the original theme song
i love michael myers and i love how he portrays dr.evil.
they keep making this shit from 1978, people are getting tired of this, only the 1st and 2nd one was the best 1978 and 1981
Does he Absorb the energy of the ppl he kills or something ? Cuz why is he so strong ?!
Band knives!
2024: Halloween Hurts- Haddonfield neighbors' POV
Looks shit 👍🏼
Okay but like the continuation is amazing, but she did NOT have that much blood on her end at the end of Halloween 2018.
Im so exited
NOTE TO PRODUCERS: Please don't give the whole damn movie away in a single trailer next time! You all did this last time (2018) and it spoiled the movie-going experience.
Michael refuses the dirty jab! That is why he stays masked.
Michael Myers walking out of the fire like he’s Scorpion from ‘Mortal Kombat’. Seriously, PUT MICHEAL MYERS IN MORTAL KOMBAT DLC! It’s a perfect opportunity!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
I see you decided to make another frail old woman take on a powerful machine like man.
😋🌝🐣🧸MICHAEL MYERS 🥺😭❤️🤗
Just give him the damn wifi password
Let it burnnnnnnnnnnn
Love to see a psychoverse with Micheal, Jason, Pinhead, Freddie, Hatchet, Damien, Chucky and Leatherface,
I know you are supposed to sympathize and even root for the Protagonist in a movie but I can’t wait for the knife of Karma to take Karen down you know it’s going to happen I think the last movie made that pretty clear. should have listened to your mom she knows why she was the way she was now after experiencing the same trauma first hand and her husband is dead because of it. They made her character hard to like on the other hand because the granddaughter took her somewhat seriously I believe she will survive the next movie but Halloween ends will be a toss up can’t wait for this one!
Laurie: Evil dies tonight   Michael: bitch I just killed 10 firefighters in the beginning
Pathetic. Our culture is bankrupt of a soul, bereft of creativity. How about some original material Universal? Just retreads of a retread.
Anybody notice.. everybody and there grandma was at the hospital 😂
I see what you did there with the Halloween 3 Silver Shamrock masks! ☘🎃
They should get Ash from Evil Dead into Speed Dial about dealing with Michael... I can't say which one is more durable; Michael or Jason.
THIS IS STUPID *didn't Jamie Lee Curtis decapitate Michael in Halloween H2O* how can he come back from that LOL
I love Laurie dropping the Loomis style lines haha
Michael: *Sneaks into house* Person: *Sees him & screams terrified* Michael: *Walks towards them with a knife* Person: *Runs outside & locks Michael inside* Michael: *Looks through the kitchen window* Person: *Puts middle finger up to him, smiling* Michael: *Grabs dog & shows the person in the kitchen window* Person: *Stops smiling & puts middle finger down* Michael *Stabs dog in the window* John Wick: “In that case, I’m thinking I’m back!”
"Does Michael really have pitch black eyes in color in the Halloween franchise or is just shadows in certain lightning?"
This dude NEVER dies, and a part of me felt this movie ran its coarse. Yet, I'm certainly going to see this because it looks bad ass that all these people are going to stop him, and he's going on a mad killing spree. This is horror and its finest.
What I'd pay to see the Paul Rudd cut
Just wondering. His mask must be flame retardant.
What does that mean when he kills he transcends does that mean he's like a "God"
woah dude…       *i’m down.*
Say something.
“I’m ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᶦⁿᵍ ᵗᵒ ᵉᵛᵉʳʸᵒⁿᵉ ʷʰᵒ ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᵉˢ ᵗᵒ ᵐᵉ ᵃⁿᵈ ˡᶦᵏᵉˢ ᵗʰᶦˢ ᶜᵒᵐᵐᵉⁿᵗ” …..,,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=222s
Laurie: “Evil dies tonight”  Michael: “Everyone dies tonight” kills cameraman and hooks up the Go Pro!
The only reason Michael is angry is because Karen is wearing a Christmas jumper when it's Halloween
Fair play to a franchise that’s the same film over and over again , boring as hell and has the same ending in every single film  for making so much money over  the years ….. that’s impressive
Bruh. Just use a god dame RPG already.      To many Halloween movies now and getting ridiculous
Ok Michael, I wasn't even born when u 1st started killing I'm 41yrs old now! Dude Retire !! U have proved your point!!
Someone said “they’re showing half the kills in the trailer” lololol you’re sooooo wronggggg
Laurie strode died in Halloween resurrection 2002 so yeah it's hard to take this seriously......
1:14 gotta love the fact that the guy is already dead, but Michael can’t resist with an extra stab
I can’t wait to waste my money again
I just want to know what brand kitchen knife MM be using….. #itbestrong
This will be the best Halloween you will ever see. " Excuse me ma'am is this fluorescent fixture still usable "
Oh, this look goodddd!!! Hope it’s a lot of action & holy shit parts. 🎃
Yess!!!
Been watching since 1978
Looks good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxAr3HkUoKM
OMG!!! IM SO EXITED!!!!!
Bruh why are you dudes staying in place? No wonder he got tier 3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
My thing is Halloween 1978 and Halloween 2 shouldve counted. Right after the 1978 Halloween film they literally left off on the first one. Wouldve made mpre sense but hey he got burnt on the secong film. Im guessing this is all the Halloween films put into Halloween kills with a twist.
Halloween Kills is better than Ghostbusters Afterlife.
This is the first Halloween movie that I actually want to see in theaters. I usually just wait to watch them
wasnt his fingers blown off in the first film 😂
Yes!
I don't know man.  I.  Just.  Don't.  Know.
*Evil dies tonight* makes me laugh because there is gonna be another movie after this one.
Is it bad that I cheer for Michael every time that he kills but I want the people to get away from him at the same time lol
The movie title should’ve said  Halloween Michael Myers vs The whole town
Purrr 😜 bestie
Same old shit....they need better witters, its the same story over and over and over
micheal kills an entire town the movie
"Grab my hand"  Micheal: Ok.
No matter how fast you run...  Michael Myers walks faster ...!
I really hope Jamie or Kyle don’t die in this I’ll be so disappointed.
Laurie: evil dies tonight  Micheal: puts his mask on
the reason he is killing is to get enough LV to fight me
I feel bad for firemen. They were just doing their job
Jason Blum STOP FUCKING HORROR GENRE!!!!
He should use the filthy chemical injection as his weapon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zsO_JQyt9A
Laurie is very brave
Laurie: EVIL DIES TONIGHT Micheal: wait...wait...wait...I was just playing around. I'm a fire fighter who fell in the basement. Pleaseeee. I don't wanna dieeee😟😟😟 Laurie: then where is Micheal.  Micheal: hehe I had a better offer made in dead by daylight so I just walked off set and joined dead by daylight.
dude this movie needs to be put to rest and quit making michael myers movies eatch time he dies then somehow he re-appears again just let it go geez....
GOD THIS LOOKS SO GOOD
Michael's gonna get real messy in this one. OH YEAH !!!! Michael is all evil.
Nah this nigga gotta have tier 3 wit tuft of hair n tombstone
Really another Halloween give it up you can't come up with another idea. 🥱🤚
🥰
Prediction: Michael doesn't make it out alive in this movie. He becomes overwhelmed and finally loses this long 40 year battle against the people of Haddonfield.
I saw the trailer at the cinema and omg-
Michael looks to be brutal this time around. He's killing everyone in his way.
Pretty much gave away the entire movie... brilliant
Just like dead by daylight. He’s prestige 3 now
You can’t kill the bogeyman 🎃🔪🔪
It’s crazy with all the technical they have to day the movies from the 80s are written better then this excuse for a movie 😂 who the fuck is writing this shit ?  This is so basic
This trailer is a hype machine
Wait wait wait wait..... if this is gonna be infused with politics.... the MOB(The Collectivist Left) vs Michael Myers (The Individual) ... oh my goodness... if this is some woke bullshit and you kill my favorite horror movie.... blah.... can't be... I am just imagining things....
👏
💪EXELENTE🤜🤛LIKA👌
they shoulld have double teamed him
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxAr3HkUoKM
With the music wand the town all coming out this is going to be The Dark Knight Rises of Halloween movies. Even the new mix has chanting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQQer62TBwI
Michael will never die! And I kinda like it that way👍
But did you see the NEW "The Batman" trailer? Your welcome https://youtu.be/Ph6tYNmF3gs
can anybody make out what the crowd is chanting?
Yall know how michael is blind from the left side of his eye and why he sees with his right eye when he comes out the house....Good detail 👌
The best....🔥🔥
Michael Myers must be listening to comethazine
Wow I thought he was dead this whole time….Halloween kills it is!
It's amazing that were getting both Michael Myers and Chucky on the same week. The Chucky TV series premieres on October 12th and Halloween Kills premieres on October 15th
माँ:- बेटा क्या कर रहे हो  बेटा :- माँ आपकी लम्बी उम्र के लिए youtube पर like कर रहा हूँ 🤣🤣🤣🤣
They are just straight up showing all the kills in the movie, lmao.
He's just like a dead man
I was looking through the comments and can't believe no one commented on the reference from Halloween 3. Those 2 victims on the merry go round were wearing Silver Shamrock masks, aswell as the victim being hung by the swings.  That's so cool!! Haha
Michael’s gonna open up a Costco size can of whoop ass!
Is he immortal or something? First he gets shot by a rifle, then ran over by a car, and now casually walks out of a burning house?
👍😍❤❤❤❤
0:39 here's the part where Michael Myers kills the firefighters
I just came
I like how the 3 dead kids are wearing the Halloween 3 masks. Pretty cool touch.
You want your mask COME GET IT!!! i gotta watch this when it drops bruh I swear
Michael mayers WILL never die

Wow that's the entire movie movie in one trailer
“Evil dies tonight”. it obviously doesn’t.
Another one... How many times are they gonna kill him and the bring him back.. that's dumb just stop making these movies only the first 2 are the good ones after that they suck.. just like fast n furious after 5 they started to suck..
Can't wait to watch it in deadmeats vid
I like how he survives being burned alive… Wish I could be that resilient…
So Michael Myers kills a whole town 😮🤙🏽 team Michael 😂
I just gonna say one thing. I love Michael Myers.
I am super happy for this and I can't tell you the last time I've been excited for a horror movie. This looks great. Not gonna watch anymore trailers. Gonna watch this when it comes out!
Typical Blumhouse trailer where half the movie is shown.
If we don’t get a kingsman church fight scene with Michael and the town, I will riot.
SO LIKE WHAT HAPPEN TO JOSH HARTNET AS Jamie Lee’s son!!!???? Wtf!!?
return of the living dead was the best, and salam's lot
Bummer man, mike killed a bunch of fire fighters....
Andi matichack ❤️❤️❤️
Who else is excited for this movie
this trailer just telling me everything that’s gonna happen
Nobody: Laurie Strode: L E T  H I M  B U R N ! ! ! 🔥🔥🔥
How are they suppost to kill Michael for good if last time someone shot him with a shotgun, their head got smashed like a pumpkin. ????
My favorite movies of all time.  There is no such thing as boogyman.  Yes there is Tommy.
What about TV 14 DLV ON Halloween kills
So they all unnecessariley extended halloween films like chewed gum on past but I feel like this will be a great one.  P.S: I hope they can't succeed to kill michael so finally michael tiers up to Evil Within 3 and 8 stacks of save the best for last stacks then kills all haddonfield and destroy the world O_O
Wow, another Halloween. I thought the last one with Jamie Lee could have saved the francised. But it didnt
Can't we send him up to the White House? 😂 #ByeThenBiden
I can’t wait
Is this Part 37?
hello 1978
Oh Michael, sigh....you've been haunting me since the first time I rode my bike to my friends house as a new teenager back in '78 to watch you on HBO that night. Little did I know that you would traumatize me for my bike ride back home at midnight later that night. I swear the faster I peddled, the more those silly sounds I heard through the brush. Made it home to crawl into bed and throw the covers over my head with a grin on my face. What am I going to do with you. You just don't seem to want to DIE!😜🤣
CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!
Why is no one talking about the incredible music showcased in this trailer?
Doesn't look like Julian's parents make it this time.
Cringe feminism
Jamie lee Curtis is such a hypocrite
looks just as shit as the last one tbh
Where is mystery inc when you need them?
Laurie : evils does tonight Michael : 🤣
Anyone else catch the Halloween 3 reference?
Who else is addicted to Halloween movies? 🎃
I haven’t even watched  Halloween Halloween 2 Halloween 3 Halloween Reboot Halloween 2018
Give him  a 357 sig to the dome
The reason he keeps surviving is because he has demonic forces helping him like Jamie's character said "he's the essence of evil" its the equivalent to a witch or warlock that do black magic and summon demonic forces to protect them......NOW YOU KNOW THE TRUTH. God bless
You can't burn the boogeyman .... you can't kill the shape ...
THERE'S ANOTHER SHUT UP!!!
That fire wasn’t gonna kill him no way.
This October is gonna be lit tbh
0:34 micheal was like it’s go time
When I saw the Halloween movie 2018 it was awesome but Halloween kills its gonna be way better. I knew Michael wasn't dead in that fire
so what this trailer tells me is that it's the entire town vs Micheal....or it seems like it's the town vs Micheal but i could be wrong. still should be fun to watch!
I just really want to know how this movie franchise is still going strong? It's been 43 years since the original, with like 10 movies/remakes since then... he's killed a ton of people, has been "killed" about a hundred times... and yet, he still hasn't killed his sister? There is one last Halloween coming out (or I assume since it's called Halloween Ends) but I'm curious if he'll finally get Laurie... or will Laurie finally get him.
"I'M COMING FOR YOU MICHAEL"  YOU GO LAURIE
Geez can't anybody even get a clean shot on this guy? Hahaha
So hyped for this... cant wait for the fucking summer to end
Is John Carpenter doing the score again?
Oral Hygiene He's armed to the teeth with.......candy
I cant wait!
Looks too gory
James A Janesse made a kill count.
Datsa lotta damage
I've always been a big fan of the original 1978 HALLOWEEN and 1981's H2 and even H20 was done fairly good (H4 -H6 were lame entries in the series & Rob Zombie's films shouldn't even count as they're simply sewer waste) and am going to see this one when it comes out but I'm giving this trailer a "Thumbs down" becuz by already showing numerous "Michael kills...." moments here ahead of the release date, Universal is SPOILING & killing any suspense of the audience being shocked &/or horrified by what's to come. Why not just show a trailer of The Shape walking around, stalking & chasing after his screaming victims with knife in hand as they trying to escape from him by running in the streets or alleys, up/down stairs, or along hallways and corridors along with the typical dialogue between the cast while the HALLOWEEN theme plays in the background, so that nothing major is given away?
This actually looks like a fun movie. It is probably going to be garbage but I really like the setup. Looking forward to (FINGERS CROSSED) watching this in cinemas.

Am I the only one that wants to see Jason Vs Michael
Halloween 3 masks 🎭
Michael Myers vs Jason. Make it happen since both these guys don't die.
You talk about him if he was a human being that part of him died years ago.
I like the season of the witch references
This is gonna be the movie where they weaken Michael try to get enough hits so when Halloween ends They finish Michael
I wonder how ma y bullets he eats in this movie
I love the Halloween 3 mask SO MUCH REFERENCES
Well micheal myers is free
How the fuck did he not die after all these movies
A child of the Druids. Love it.
Lol why keep bringing this dude back not Friday and Jason
Laurie: Evil dies tonight   Michael: *On 56 man kill streak*
0:11 YES YES JOBTOWN BABY!!!
As a volunteer EMT/FF in training I wanted to point out their SCBA’s are like from the 90s. Modern SCBA’s don’t look like that. Also, Firefighters would never enter a active fire until Police Secured the area. I understand it’s Michael Myers, but like cmon at-least be realistic for firefighters
This series will never end...we can't let it
Lol toujours la même merde pfff
Just like Freddy vs Jason Michael Myers vs the town
I wanna see this movie 🍿 so bad
So it goes Halloween 1978, Halloween 2 Halloween 2018 and Halloween kills and we can just forget about the rest
Me vs the lvl 1 characters after doing the side quests first:
Michael Meyers is alive!!!!! Jamie Lee not so much.
Seriously don't understand why they can't just go get a grenade or other explosive and blow is ass up. He would just stand there and take it. Also if like 20 people cam up and started just chopping him with axes there would be nothing he could do. Chop him up. So dumb. Real life doesn't transfer to dumb movies.
Not even God himself can help us now.
Laurie: "Evil, dies, tonight" Michael: "Aw shit, here we go again"
*Let it burn* Kylo Ren: “She’s just like me”
We need van helsing
What happened to the character Jamie Lee son H20 lol ok I'm  still going to watch .
Did everyone forget about Laurie's son?
Damn they brought Marion back just to kill her again.
They turned Michael Myers into Jason Voorhees and turned Haddonfield into Crystal Lake LOL, I like it let's go 🎃🎃🎃🎃
im triggered that after 30 years of planning all she could think of was leave him in a burning bulding
Much killing for a pensioner...
If I don’t see Myers fortnite dance on the firefighters body I won’t like it
Will this franchise ever end?!!!
Well  dead meat is going to have sooooo much fun with this kill count that's for sure
I don’t think Michael will die until laurie does due to the curse  This will just keep going and going until she dies of old age
halloween https://youtu.be/UWBWmpBHIxE
Michael is going on a killing spree!🔥🔥🔥🔥
@1:23 Come you've been saying that more than 20 years 😂
I still think there's no way he can kill all the firefighters but I guess I'll have to just wait patiently and see.
The one relative that just wont die
They showed too much by him just escaping alone. The whole movie is now just about murder. What’s next? Him being shot by a river by the whole town, and they think he is dead and wakes up until the next movie…
I will try one last time, cause this one actually looks decent. But if they dont kill the killer or he somehow survives another retarded unreal incident im done with these bullshit serialkiller fairytales.
I had to stop watching the trailer. Showed everything.
I thought Fast & Furious needed to stop…. but THIS takes the biscuit smh
Are we getting Michael without mask ???
2:10
I’m so fucking happy about this.
Movies are trash  these days Michael myers.movie should be the best for awhile lol sad but true looking forward for this to come out
Top 10 ways to get a very fast death Number 1: Do what Karen does at 2:20
Why is there another sequel? Family
stop terrorizing this old lady wtf man
https://youtu.be/56NTj5aVRPw Coronavirus evil prediction In year 2011 😱😱😱
I told ya that I'd be back!
Just saying she could have killed him in the the last movie when he kicked in the door she could have put buck shot through his head and the problem would have been solved.
She better kill her brother this time. Cause he went after her over 45 years.,
The only thing that will kill off Michael Meyers is when Captain Kirk dies. The mask will then meld to his face and then The Shape becomes shapeless and oozes to the floor. All they have to do is get William Shatner on to the set and kill him. This would be the best script in history.
I have a feeling he didn’t die in the last movie
No comments about the Halloween 3 masks????
2:17 when Myers is on Tier 3 with Tombstone offering.
Blumhouse is clearly incapable of making a decent horror movie. All they do is generic pc Hollywood garbage.
Halloween kills    Next movie: Halloween ends
I love with this is going
More persons are out of haven of Lord Jesus because are aliens of demond.
Michael Myers needs a skin in dbd from this film where is outfit is old and rotted to show it's been 40 years
"Evil dies tonight" Laurie, you said that 40 years ago, do you really mean it this time?
Even though the new Halloween films arent as iconic as the older ones, its still a Halloween film. I mean, how much more could you ask for?
Laurie: “Evil dies tonight!” Michael: “Nah I’m good….I’m going to level up with the points from all the kills I’m getting!
I can't wait for this movie 😍❤
Michael will not die in the new film I bet he kills lauri and her daughter and Alison will take over and hunt him down in yet another Halloween film vice verse
Is it wrong for me to want Michael to win 😂😂😂😂
It feels like venom and Michael Myers has a score to settle
I liked the Halloween 3 Easter egg
Damn they really coming for Michaels head
Guy kills alot of people and cops..lady who says he is bad and is considered a crazy lady ignored. Guy kills alot of people and the crazy lady house is on fire same night. Not send cops..just fire men to go explore. Not send a bunch of guns with guns to surround area and locate killer.. not ask crazy lady..just go and act like it's normal. Get stabbed and wonder what we are supposed to do
Laurie: Evil dies tonight Two seconds later: Damn, evil got hands.
I think hé survives this one again I hope
The mask of silver shamrock
Laurie: Evil dies tonight ***** Coming this summer******** Laurie: Evil dies tonight ******Coming this spring********  Finally  ******Laurie dies tonight***
He never fucking dies
Universal: How many Halloween movies are we going to have? Director: Yes.
If any of the movies were real life would be crazy but what would be even crazier is that if these characters had followers Damm
How much u wanna bet....his mechanic's suit is meant to be flame resistant
No matter how much they try to kill him he is always gonna live with another dramatic trailer scene
Michael Myers now has enough killstreaks to choose a tactical nuke on “call of duty” 🚀
Thats a nice nod at 1:33 to Halloween 3: Season of the witch. Surprised nobody caught that.
Bruh.. for how many more movies you gonna keep him immortal?
Is it bad to say team Michael
Its the future failure personification of tannis.... nice
That part when they heard the sirens and screamed at the paramedics as they went to the burning house “Let it burn”
Anyone else notice the masks from Halloween III
October my favorite time of year, but this 2021 wayyyy better as Michael Myers strikes again! 😀🎃🔪🔪🔪🎆🎆🎆🎆🎆
I’m still angry Michael is gonna die next year in 2022. But this has to be one of the greatest movies in this franchise.
I'm hyped.
John 11:25-26 25.Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: 26.And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this? Mark 1:15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel. John 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. Acts 2:38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. May Father God bless you all in our Lord and Savior's name, Jesus Christ, amen
why did they give so much away though.......
Yeah I’m also for the idea of flipping the script, hunting him instead
Ok what about her son and her grandson it seems like they should bring them back
every horror movie character: lets get in arms reach with the gun to kill him....
My girl Laurie is such a badass
Laurie: Evil dies tonight.  Michael: That's why I'm purging all the evil.
Oh damn! Back at it again, how beautiful!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
NO NO LET IT burn
jesus they showed us everything in this trailer
I like how they are ignoring the sequels... can see dom turning up at the end 'FAMILY'
AHHH
Picks up exactly where it was left in the last movie. I’m shocked Jamie did another movie but I’m into it. 🤣👍🏼
When this movie will have a real end ? It’s like it will never happen or what ?
And so he becomes a generic slasher
That shot at 0:35 is amazing

“this all ends tonight”  HALLOWEEN 3 REMASTERED (2022) EDITION COMING SOON
Looks low effort and cheap tbh
Fam the violin in the trailer is dope
She was in Christmas with the Kranks
I’m not really into horror, Fire Dept Chronicles brought me here
As a retired firefighter I find this trailer offensive because I know of firefighters who were killed on fire scene because the person lured them there to kill them. So I don't appreciate this trailer one bit. It pure garbage and offensive.
Never bring a knife to a gun fight but in this case bring everything we got to a knife fight.
"The more he kills, the more he transcends."  My boi Michael is just grinding EXP to level up!
THE SHAPE, RETURNS.
Dammit Laurie. Why didn't u stabbed him in the head with that sewing stick
Firefighters have been murder on fire scenes by people who have set the fire to lure the firefighters there so that Why this trailer Is a piece of garbage and just plain wrong. Firefighters have to worry about what's going to happen on scene They have been shot at, sometimes they have had people come at them with knives so this trailer is shit garbage trash whatever dirty word I can think of it's wrong.
Is that how you show your thanks to firefighters making a whole trailer of slaughtering firefighters. Well Im going make petition to have this piece of garbage trailer and scene removed from the movie.
wow......and they all stood there and watched as they one by one got chopped up by myers XD
0:30; The devil comes out of Hell.
whyyyy did I watch this at night...
When the beat picks up at 2:19 is when the goosebumps kick in
The moral of the story is  Michael Myers never dies
"EVIL DIES TONIGHT"  Movie Studio Executive: "NOT ON MY WATCH"
Hey guys… I think this might be bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Fuck dat-  "Michael Vs Predators" if you really want him destroyed!
why does every time we wait for second part of the movie and years later we gonna wait more months 😩
This trailer gave me chills. I am SO pumped for this. This is why Halloween is my all time favourite slasher horror.
Anyone else catch the masks from Halloween III ?
Laurie: "Evil dies tonight" Michael: " keep dreaming sista"  when i saw this i literlly screamed like i was dying or sum bc i fucking love how this gets better every year, and im sooo addicted to Michael Myers, like he was my fav and forever serial killer, never have i ever stoped liking him, or being him for halloween. CAINT WAIIIIT
Halloween Kills: Lorie *Evil Dies tonight  Halloween Ends: Michael Myers still Breathing
I guess Haddonfield needs my help 🥱.
Holy crap he's burning it for the insurance money the scene is not safe! Where are the cops!?
laurie: Evil dies tonight.     michael: maybe not tonight..
this is starting to look the like the fast and furious movies lmao too many to count and getting worse each movie
I like these movies a lot thank you
Can’t wait see this movie
Why yell "Let it burn" instead of telling the paramedics/emt staff so they can alert dispatch that Michael Myers(after 40 years i'm sure they know who he is) is there and he killed 2 Deputies and a few civilians.  That way they can stage, alert Police officers to not enter, have multiple SWAT teams from state, county and local cities to form a perimeter and declare it a barricade and stand  by for Federal agencies including the national guard(If the governor decides to activate them)  and then let them handle him but instead you're yelling at Emergency vehicles  go code 3 l(lights and sirens)  hoping they would hear you and then we have to see fire fighters get massacred.
Dooo dooo dooo dooo dooo
YEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
More of this old bullshit get real ffs.
Michael Myers vs The Terminator who would win
The most satisfying thing they could do in this one is kill Laurie off. It would be the ultimate pay off for the Halloween franchise and I feel like even Jamie Lee Curtis would agree.
I saw the original Halloween movie that came out in 1978. When I saw the 2018 movie, I hated it. True Halloween fans can't be expected to just forget the last 40 years, and pretend like none of the other movies ever happened! Michael never escaped Smith's Grove, he's just been chilling with Dr. Loomis the whole time? Lol! That's why I have no desire to see this one. I knew the 2018 movie would be just as awful as I figured it would be. I hate when writers/directors retcon movies and/or shows, and try to change things that should be left alone. Should NEVER try to fix things that aren't broken!
The fact that Micheal is like 60 years old and still slanging kitchen knives is crazy too me can somebody get rid of the grumpy old man already??? But I’m definitely watching to see how he escape this time 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Chills absolute chills
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxAr3HkUoKM&t=600s
I still buy into it even it’s been 40 years of the same thing, no one has killed him. And Jamie lee Curtis really is the only person for this role, she’ll always have that I believe. No one else could play lead the same
I just noticed the shot of Allyson staring into the morgue. Poor thing sees her friends, and her dads body was in the house when they lit it up.
Omg
Is that Gordon Ramsay under the mask?
You can't kill my boy Mike. He's ruthless. Never stops coming after that bitch. 💯🔪
and thats why you have cops at every fire scene
Anybody else come from fire department chronicles?
Będzie oglądane
Omg finallyyyyyyy❤️❤️❤️😍
How long will jamie lee curtis keep running away? Lots people have died becoz of her, she should give up her life to michael and save millions of other peoples lives, she is too old now playing hide and seek
Just send in Jason to finish off Michael !!!!!
Perhaps the title should have been, "Halloween: Michael Goes Madara." ;)
Im watching that at 3:00AM
Michael got some serious damage to do and the theme suits it perfectly
😁😁😁
Anyone else noticed the homage to Halloween 3 season of the witch?
Yoooooooooo
yeahhhhhh let's go
Is this a trailer or a summary of the movie
I can’t wait.
ขนตูดลุกดูจังเลย
Imagine if michael had a high pitched voice
Laurie: Evil dies tonight 😠 Michael: "Aw sht here we go again"
I don’t think we can put into words how good this trilogy is going to be. We’ve got half the original cast from the frickin 70s in this movie, not to mention the original scream Queen. What a time to be alive.
wait a minute this isn’t a kill count trailed
Mm Idk 🤔
"You Want Your Mask....Come & Get It"
Follow my TikTok michaelmyers274
OH HELL YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!! Can't wait
I AM LITERALLY LOSING MY FUCKING MIND!!! IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING?!?!?! OMG! I HAD GOOSEBUMPS THE WHOLE TRAILER. I CANT HANDLE THIS...SOOO STOOKKKKKEEEDDDDD!!!!!! 🔥😍👻🎃🍬🌙
Evil dies tonight, ie 100 innocent bystanders.  😂😂😂
Micha meyers is the GOAT of killing hands down
Laurie:  I'm Coming For you Michael.  Michael:  BRING IT!
ใช่ภาค2ป่ะ
Nick Castle Is the legend so of course he has to finish the last two movies
Okay the “evil...dies...tonight!” Line was just corny..
Damn it, I'm waiting on Michael vs Jason. Or even put them in the same town. That would be game OVA!!!
Micheal vs .... Micheal...
“I’m coming for you Michel.” -everyone liked that-
I can't take this trailer serious after i watched a video of Michael eating chips
What were those firefighters thinking?? Oh here I go Mike, kill me next!
REVEALING like wayyyyyy too much AGAIN!
🎃🔪
It was at this moment that he knew, He fuçked up 0:28
It...ii.it just like killer game 31 From movie 31
I'm still not over the fact that the silver shamrock masks are in here
This would be a 1 VS ALL Death match.
Blumhouse🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love the idea of the whole town going after him!  Let the bodies hit the floor!
Michael Myers is flesh and blood but a man couldn’t have survived that fire. the more he kills the more he transcends. he’s the essence of evil.
Michael myers vs jason cross over would be great
This is it isn’t it…..ITS NEVER GONNA END NEVER GONNA ENDDDDDDDDDDD SOMEONE END IT FFS. SOME ONE JUST STOP THE ENDLESS SHIT PARADE.
YES FUCKING YES
The beginning is so chilling.
-What makes a Michael a Michael? - We don't die! We transcend
Dude there ruining the Halloween franchise its played out
As much as I do have hope for this movie, I have some doubts. I am excited to see Michael slaughter everyone whilst battling Laurie and I hope that we get convincing character and story arcs, but I hope that it doesn’t do the Halloween 5 thing where that movie advertised that Michael was going toe to toe with the cop, but the movie we got was a mess that failed in its storyline, kills, characters, writing, and execution. I liked the 2018 Halloween, and I hope that this movie lives up and surpasses it. This is going to be the first Halloween movie I will see in the theater and you better not let me down, Universal. You gave me 3 movies I like (Halloween 2, 3, 2018), and you should make this a good movie too.
I wonder if this shit Is ever gonna end 😂😂
Fuk yes!!!!!!
How TF did I miss this?! Can't wait to watch, the last one was great, this is gonna be epic!
Jamie Lee Curtis: I'm coming for you, Michael, Michael: Come at me bro!
Why do all the old crazy monster killers have normal names? Michael, Freddy, Jason, Chucky... Ijs they all sound like normal people on paper 😁
I finally watch the new one from 2019 lol I was all excited seeing Laurie back, but honestly I didn’t feel the same chills like the first two. I hate the fact they took the part he was brother. It was more interesting with that story. That being said I will watch this bc I am still a fan 😂😂
Oh no, this is maybe just me but, it feels like the movie about to kill laurie in that hospital….
Hope isnt like the 2018 feminist shit
Bru why didn’t they all just jump him or throw shit at him
Michael Myers is the wasp you slapped with your hat, thinking it was dead, then a few hours later you see a wasp flying around your kitchen table.
all fun and games until he puts on tombstone
Just launch him into space or the middle of the ocean. I doubt he could survive that.
My boy is like this is new I’m the one who hunts them
Finally, slasher movie!
But they definitely have another reboot for the franchise, I mean it’s gotta kill from suspense but I’m pretty sure carpenter knows there’s old and gen z fans, everyone alike. They have to make it meaningful suspense
Me and my girlfriend was supposed to see this together we saw the first one at the movies but she passed away it wont be the same when I see it
If he dies, there’s no third movie. I’d say even Laurie dying would ruin the trajectory. It’s gonna be him killing a bunch of people except the strodes but who knows on what premise, gotta end on real suspense to reel in people for a third sequel
Que buena tula la del maicol mayers
I'm calling it now but the next movie is Michael vs the Army.
This looks SAVAGE AF.
I hate how movie trailers give away everything before the movie is even out. We didn't need to see him kill every firefighter, him walking out of the house and encountering them already tells us what's about to happen.
made by blumhouse of course its gonna be good
This looks like it's going to be the best Halloween movie installment to date!!! 😮
2:20 Your free trial of life has reached its expiration day.
Why not just let him go home?
Oh my god the Halloween 3 reference lmao
These are so nice movies but unfortunately I m getting none at YouTube of these movies in full version.
Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees would make a very good team
Looks like old age is gonna kill Laurie Strode long before Michael does
If they wouldn't have put tht fire out he would have died
Just let the house burn
Why wouldnt they just call a military or police. This could be over very quick if they rain bullets to this guy
Fun fact:  Mike Myers’ mask is the actual face of William Shatner. The essence of evil is Captain Kirk.
well it will be interesting!! but will he finally be destroyed?? all through the years will all the battles this shape has been through and the pain and death he has inflicted on people.. the mass of destruction!! what else can he possibly do?? I dont know about anyone else's thoughts.. but I hope this does not end like a zombie movie.. hint!!!
“He ascends…”  That is concerning. Either she is exaggerating and means he gets more efficient with every time he takes a life, or there is something _much, much darker_ happening.
All the dislikes are the people that are mad he’s not dead
The only thing I wish. I could watch from home on release date. I don't care for theaters
hes bout to add 50 kills to his killstreak
Michael butchering all those firefighters reminds me of Jason Voorhees for some reason. Don’t quite know why. Anyway the movie looks awesome
Cannot wait
I didn't know this was like the 100th Halloween.
Holy shit nice Halloween 3 reference
"evil dies tonight - unless this makes a ton of money"
Jamie Lee still killing it (pun intended) after all these years.
It took them all these years to figure out they need to jump Michael
Didn't mike lose fingers last movie? Did they just respawn back?😂😂
And I like the og ones there good to
I really like michael myers
I like how Lindsey Wallace has Jamie lee Curtis lines from Halloween 1978
So when we getting Jason v. Myers: Evil meets Evil
Looks like they showed the entire movie 🍿 in just a dews minutes. 🧐
Oh good. Michael kills Kyle Richards 😈
Шо, опять?!
Pisses me off they never show his damn face.
Great Job Hollywood, y'all destroyed a legend!!!
Michael  Myers icon
Ooh!  Red band trailer, not announced!
Michael be getting popular again while Jason is stuck in court. Can I get an f for all the Friday the 13 fans?
Welp, don’t have to watch the movie anymore. The trailer showed all the kills already 🙄
I’m so ready!!!
The night he came home.
This trailer looks SO badass!!!😏😁🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I can't wait to see this!!! It's going to be awesome!😎
I can't wait to see this movie. Huge Michael Myers fan.
Jamie Lee Curtis: “I’m coming for you Michael…” Mike Myers: “YEAH BABY YEAAAAH!”
Laurie: Evil dies tonight  me: omg, that Michael hard to get killed, it's just dangerous
I think it would be interesting if a large group of neckbeard types heard someone in a William Shatner mask was going around killing people and loaded up every assault rifle and shotgun in their possession to go kill him. I just think it would add a lot of tension as to how Michael would survive the encounter given that he's still technically only a human.
Keep Michael get rid of Jamie lee Curtis. You can tell she’s from the 70s when appearance didn’t mean anything
Y como se ve pirata :'v
I can't wait to see what that mob was about!
👀
continuity is shit from the first second!!!
Keep playing ... Mike will be going head up with the Fast and the furious team next.  Dom vs Mike... quarter mile race!!!
I'm waiting for the movie where they drop a nuke on him. He becomes (another)evil hulk 🤔
I just hope there isn’t no offscreen kills
Cool trailer
I know this is a obvious answer but I wonder if it is going in to the theaters
At this point we need the Avengers
If at 0:29 you edit in Loomis saying "in my heart I knew hell would not have him" from Halloween 5 it would be so cool.
Nobody…..    Absolutely fucking nobody               “Guy with baseball thinks he has a chance”
So is this the 3rd movie now?
🔥 😷🔪⚰️
Looks like they're milking it again, instead of learning from past mistakes. This one will suck
The old woman, 37 sequels later: Evil ends tonight! Michael Myers: Ah dang! here we go again.
In this episode of: Micheal Myers tiers up on toxic survivor mains
I like how the actor who played Michael Myers, James Jude Courtney, described him. He said he doesn't necessarily believe Michael is evil, but rather a human predator. He doesn't kill because he enjoys it but because it's his nature. His nature is to hunt and kill other people. That's what he was born to do. He's an apex predator. I'm obviously paraphrasing his quote, but that's what I took from what he was saying and I find that a lot more intriguing than saying he's "evil personified ", which by the way is still a cool description in and of itself, too.
This is aka Manhunt. Town versus Micheal Myers. Lordy lou more murder gonna happen here than the last one
Wow two more Halloween films looking forward to seeing them
" Evil Dies tonight" ahem we still got another movie after this.
Michael Myers : Just because I died does not make me dead
at 1:47 what where they chanting
They didn’t have to spoil a lot in this trailer. A lot of cool kills we could’ve seen for the first time in the theaters…
minkle mir
What bothers me about movies like this they depict Michael myers as some crazy lunatic killer and in the next breath they try to show some kind of meathod to his madness is it so wrong for him to have a reason for why he kills all the other do why not him Jason leatherface Candyman all the rest had a motive to get behind the movie looks great and I'd really like to see I just hope they give him methodology you can sink you teeth into
Lmao when he gets poked in the eye with a hanger it hurts but when he gets shot on burns in a fire he’s ok lmao
Swear this is gonna be lit. HALLOWEEN IS COMING!

Been playing Dead by Daylight with Michael Myers, man I can't wait for this!
40 years, girl he ain’t dying, might as well offer yourself 😩
The Violen theme goes hard
I’m so hiped, less get it😁
I can’t wait. Love Jamie and Michael Meyers. Halloween is my favorite Horror movie since the very first one. ♥️
Put old school horror actors back to work universal and your profits will skyrocket
Michael Myers vs Jason
Feel like this trailer showed a little too much, still excited though!
🧡🎃🔪
You know, I have read several comments since this trailer was released 2 weeks ago, and among them they write things about the scene that escapes from Laurie's burning house like: "How was Michael able to kill all the firefighters at once if it's just one person?" or also "That is not possible to happen, it is unreal". Therefore, I made several theories about this scene:  1.- The firefighters were only notified to go to the house to put out the fire, perhaps because of the danger it symbolizes being near a forest, because of that, no one knew that Michael is trapped, or rather hidden, where I start the fire.  2.- Everyone outside was completely in shock and frozen when they saw Michael leave the house intact, since as Laurie mentioned: "No man can survive a fire", therefore, they were still processing what they saw being too late to act when Michael started murdering them.  3.- Even if all the firefighters were in a group against him, his anger, rage and hatred towards the town of Haddofield gave him the necessary fuel to kill each of them without problems, let's add that the stamina he uses to withstand the attacks that they perform against him; Also remember that Michael is not human, he is evil in person using the form of a man to kill anyone who sees and gets in his way as it is what he wants to do, kill for fun and whim.
Man, you need to let it go.  Literally, overkill.
I'm getting sick of seeing Halloween movies now
Michael Myers finally gets rid that cheap knife and proceeds to kill entire town way more horrifying as it can be.
Yea real fun 😅😅
43 years later these movies never get old.
“Let’s hunt him down” Michael: “Are you sure about that???”
wow
О, боже 💥😳💥 Готовлю подгузники и попкорн ✓
They show too much In the trailer
looks pretty good better than that QUIET PLACE 2 RUBBISH
Dad what’s was your world like before you had me Michael: so I had my kitchen knife
Finally... no more running... now they hunt down Michael... and end this franchise...     Hopefully
...
[ Deep breath ] Here we go again. Again [ sigh ]
This is worth seeing
It’s the guy from dead by daylight
Did anybody else see the Halloween 3 reference
We should ban kitchen knives
Who designed a mask so legendary
Michael Myers is MnM (EMINEM)?
X marks the spot t the $$$$
My man mike really about pull a madara against all of haddenfield
Love the Halloween 3 references with the masks on the playground 😈‼️
https://youtu.be/pmVSnzKHAJU
Jamie lee Curtis is the goat no 🧢
Michael Myers is level 99 he’s 10 kills off level 100
Damn you trailers! .... spoil the movie already.
Bruh he’s using a tombstone
I realize Michael seemed somewhat superhuman in the 2018 film but people are asking what is he, he’s not a man, how did he survive that fire but look at 1:51 it’s obvious he hid in there and would have stayed there until someone found him. Not trying to dis on the film because Halloween 2018 in my opinion is the best film out of the franchise so I’m excited to see this film I just thought that was a somewhat obvious plot hole everyone keeps missing.
I’m so fucking excited
This dude just dont die🤣🤣🤧
I'm excited for this one. Looking good
Michael Myers please
Michael Myers song
And they always happen to be male. I wonder why.,
I have something to share with whoever will listen. There's good news and bad news...  Let's start with the bad news.   "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God' -Romans 3:23  Everyone has sinned against God; rebelling against him and against the way he creted things to be. God is a just judge therefore he cannot let sin go unpunished. The penalty for our sin is death. ( the second death is hell)   "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." Romans 6:23  Now for the Good News 🙂  God/Jesus loves you. God loves you so much that he sent Jesus to die in your/my place so that we could be free from sin, and death (the second death a.k.a. hell). Jesus willingly took the punishment for us.  He was beat, wounded, humiliated, and killed for our faults. But he ressurrected from the grave! 😁 Conquoring sin, and death for us.   “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." -John 3:16  Now if you place your trust in Jesus Christ alone you can be saved. Nobody/no other god  has the power to save except for Jesus. If you accept him as your lord and savior. (Give him authority and control over your life, trust and accept his saving help.) then you will be saved from the coming judgment, and sin. (This doesn't mean that you won't ever sin, but it's just not who you are anymore)  "that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved" - Romans 10:9   This is just the begginning. Jesus a.k.a God wants a relationship with you. Where you can grow to be more holy, and get to know your creator. 💖 Read the Bible and pray (talk to him honestly and like he 's your friend). Find a community of believers if you can.   Always remember that you are so so loved (by God) and so so valuable in his sight.
93 days
Bro definitely heard Captain Price saying “You’re the last one alive complete the mission”.
Fork thinks it cheesy
Why do they keep showing Black people  killed first you was fine with usual suspects  ...
great job keep it going
Ooooh....Halloween 3 reference.  👏👏
Can they PLEASE just let this series die
Halloween:40 years later part 2
this dude does not die wtf
https://youtu.be/th4etOfL3qc
Can we all agree that you in this situation would be annoyed as hell, rather than scared
Judging by the trailer it looks like laurie is not in the movie much
Halloween > All the other killer movies like friday 13th and freddie
Dude must be 60 by now, wtf.
Its the guy from Dead By Daylight
Universal Pictures waiting for Jurassic World Dominion Trailer : )
Wow!! Excited
I just watched the whole movie on this trailer…
They reveal so much in trailers these days, they seemed like pivotal scenes
If they don't realese the new scream movie trailer this movie is making me interested in the new scream movie
Halloween  Halloween kills Halloween kills again Halloween kills again in space
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
This is like Halloween 2 continuing from the same night
3.2k idiots didn't like this.
Michael: haha knife go brrrrrrrrr
halloween kills micheal: transcends dead by daylight micheal: no pants
Does anyone know how long this movie is ? Minutes that is ? Hopefully longer than the 2018 Halloween. I feel like all good Horror Movies like this should be at a minimum of 2 Hours in length. Either way I can’t wait until October 15th, 2021 because I can tell this one is gonna be way better than the 2018 film which I know this is the Sequel to that film but still just from this trailer you can tell it’s gonna get a lot more interesting in this one!

“Evil dies tonight” oh stop quit acting like there isn’t gonna be another movie in three years your just saying that to look cool.
hes running scratched mirror and judiths tomb stone in this movie trying to get that extra bp
https://youtu.be/UBBnn4hMt4Q
https://youtu.be/UBBnn4hMt4Q
https://youtu.be/UBBnn4hMt4Q
I love this
1:33 I love all of the masks from the third Halloween, great Easter egg!
And this trailer makes the law enforcement look dumb
Laurie: evil dies tonight Producers: let’s make another movie 😂
🔥🔥🔥
"You can't kill damnation Mister!"  Mr. Sayer. Halloween 4.
'The more he kills, the more he transcends'   Michael's gonna be transcending into the 5th dimension now given this movie has the highest kill count.
That’ll how a good scary movie should be made like I’ll be there to see it
This looks fucking amazing can’t wait
I think this ganna be the last one, it looks like a continue of the 2018 movie
Evil never dies 😱
Laurie better not die.
If Michael Myers gets killed in this would it be the final of the franchise...............oh yeah I forgot there will be two more after this coming in 2022
they show too much in these trailers
Cant wait! Met the original Michael Myers in Salem, Mass  Totally awesome experience! His autographed picture will hang on my wall forever!!!
Ah so the trailer basically spoils how Michaels going to die. Interesting
she means evil dies until next Halloween
He moves good for a 64 year old man
Hey guys I believe next Halloween when "Halloween Ends" ends they will go to Mexico.  Laurie: Hey Allyson you still have those $3,000 I gave you earlier? Allyson: Yes I do grandma. Laurie: Now that we killed The Boogeyman, I think we should definitely go somewhere... go to Mexico! Allyson: Yeah, totally!  I think it would be so much fun, if the third movie would end like that. I mean... totally!
Big M is going down this Halloween.this hockey mask ain’t symbolic.
You can tell this movie is gonna be trash when they turn Halloween into some bloodlust, revenge, action movie. What made the original Halloween movies great was the suspense, the fear and the way Michael quietly stalked his unaware victims. It all built up to a climactic finish. This is all in your face,  cheap jumpscare hollywood bs.
It looks really bad... unfortunately.
No matter how fast you run; Michael walks faster...
lol ... "Blumhouse" ...
Im in my 40s and Halloween has always been my favourite horror movie ever and this one is out a few days before my birthday and I cannot wait. 🎃❤
Eventually everything dies but Michael Myers seem to never die.
Yikes 😳
The firefighters didn't even do anything to help Micheal so that means he would of escaped the fire anyways
Anyone scared that this might be the last one
1:40 Michael's look after they say "let's hunt him down", looks so savage
I’m so excited
*"Your claiming supernatural but what am I? I got shot six times burned alive and i didnt die!"*
TRANSCENDS!
Sadly going to be another disappointment, when the trailer is a let down you already know how this is going to go
Next vilao Zé ninguém fast and furiosos ?
In 2012, I almost died from a drug overdose but Jesus Christ saved my life.  During this near death experience, I cried out to the Lord Jesus in prayer and repented to Him for my sins and He saved my life.  I would also encourage you to pray to the Lord Jesus and repent to Him for your sins and then get fully submerged under water as a baptism to God in the name of Jesus Christ or otherwise if you don't repent to Jesus for your sins and obey what He wants you to do with your life then when you die you will go to hell.
This might seems fucked up but dude i really hope Michael DOESN'T die like the Halloween series is so damn GOOD
How is this man still alive
🙄
Laurie -Let it Burrrrn   Firefighters- Bruh We can’t here you.
Michael might WINN in holloween kills
EVIL DIES TONIGHT.  Uh huh. Until they decide to milk the franchise some more and make another one of these turkeys. Maybe the next one can be in space. Or the past? That could mix it up. Michael Myers in the wild west. Or maybe Michael vs the roman empire. Free ideas hollywood, help yourself on me.
Finally! Haddonfield fights bsck
THEY FREAKING NAILED THE REBOOT..... this looks just as good!! I prefer the Rob Zombie Michael Myers simply because it gave a believable backstory to why he hunts Laurie but man the new ones are EPIC!
Okay this movie looks fucking amazing however I really hope they don’t actually show Micheals face as it kind of ruins the idea that he’s evil incarnate
"Like the old woman said. Together"
"So, how much money you think we're gonna make from Halloween Kills Again after we say that Michael survived the ATM machine that crushed his skull at the end of Halloween Kills?"
I love it... I need A nightmare on Elm Street, and Friday the 13th and my life is complete. 🤙🏼
https://youtube.com/shorts/XfGyi5oyWRQ?feature=share
Who's ready for Michael Myers In October
*amogus*
I'm glad they didn't put the flashback scene in the trailer that way when u see it in the theater for the first time its really gonna be cool
In 1:14 if she’s dead then why Is her body still moving? Or it’s just the camera
So did he hide in the gun compartment room or something when Laurie was keeping her guns
That mob will probably kill Ted Hollister by mistake.
I honestly feel bad for those fire fighters...
Someone forgot to tell Micheal Myers that Black Lives Matter...
Holy Hell! This is gonna be the slashed tits!
This may be the new empire strikes back of sequels
I just know this movie will never too the classics
How does this trailer get 1million views a day
The last movie was boring.
They shouldve listened to lourie
If he’s this much of a problem just call in special forces he would be dead in minutes lol, helicopter surveillance would easily track his location. Horror films are shit these days so unrealistic
NOOOOOO NO NO NO NO NO NO NOOOOO LET IT BURNNNNNN
Wasn't Michael blown to smitherens or something in the last movie ??
michael miers return
i love the move
Rest In Peace to those Fire Fighters 😔🙏

The hunter became the hunted
You all think they're going to kill Michael, i don't think they have a chance against him
Holy heck; the TRAILER has a death count!
I hope John comes back cause he's been gone since H20 and Laurie is pretty f'ed up to not even tell him about Karen. Do you think his baby will show up, do Tommy and Karen still have it?
Omg I'm so excited lol, I used to have his razor glove as a kid and wore it for Halloween lol I just love Jason
Am I the only one that was trying to see if his fingers were still blown off from the last film?
SALVATION BY GRACE, THE GIFT OF GOD WE RECEIVE WHEN WE PUT OUR FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST FOR ETERNAL LIFE, FORGIVENESS OF ALL SIN & RECONCILIATION TO GOD.  Romans 10:9 Because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Acts 4:12 And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved. Ephesians 2:8 For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God. John 14:6 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” 1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 1 John 5:13 I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God that you may know that you have eternal life. 1 Peter 2:24 He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed. 1 Peter 3:21 Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. 1 Corinthians‬ ‭15:3-4‬ ‭ESV‬‬ ‘For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,’ 1 Thessalonians 5:9 For God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. 2 Corinthians 5:17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. 2 Corinthians 5:21 For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. 2 Corinthians 6:2 For he says, “In a favorable time I listened to you, and in a day of salvation I have helped you.” Behold, now is the favorable time; behold, now is the day of salvation. 2 Peter 3:9 The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance. 2 Thessalonians 2:13 But we ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you as the firstfruits to be saved, through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth. Acts 16:31 And they said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.” Acts 2:38 And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.” John 1:12 But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God. John 3:36 “Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.” John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.
Imagine the Tobey maguire Spiderman fighting michel Myers
Halloween vs Friday the 13 Michael vs Jason beat movie of the year my idea look at my profile Ronald Vickers share this to everyone
Q: How do you actually kill Michael Myers?  Me: *Dialing "Hello? Is this Mr. John Wick?"
https://youtu.be/2hti5HVKobE
When the michael is down. Cut his arms legs or something. Then michael cant come back! Thats the thing but they cant think this
Michael won’t die at the end of this movie!! My money says he whips the firefighter ass!! Whips the mob of Haddonfield residents trying to track him down..
Spectators: how did michael not die? Michael: shhh. You are not gonna know that
imagine michael kills everyone while moonwalking
Love your videos!!! They are so well produced. Stay safe everyone ❤️
Everybody gangster till Michael Myres starts to kill the whole town
It's like stoick the vast said:It takes more than a little fire to kill me
Just tell John Wick that Michael killed his other dog. Problem solved.
"You can't *kill* the *boogeyman* "
Ahhhh the mask eater egg
Bro I love how badass this guy is takes the hand of a man then kills him and that walk out cool people don’t look at explosion
I like how even though an entire town is planning on jumping Michael Myers, it still feels like a fair fight lol.
Looks like we got a tombstone build bois
Its weird how the world doesn't know about Michael's existence yet. Like they should had already brought the U.S military to fight him by now
KILL EM ALL MICHAEL
"i always come back" by: a friend
The chainsaw is going to be a great scene. Oh I can’t wait for this movie.
How to survive michael myers:   Step 1: *Be the cameraman*
At this point I feel like Michael could be dismembered and he still wouldn’t die……..and btw it’s pretty messed up that nobody gave the firefighters a heads up that Michael Myers is in that fire im sure thats information they would’ve liked to have known lol
What a stupid idea for a movie.
Halloween 3 masks even :)
*Now who fed Michael Myers with Tiers*
Bout damn time they start releasing Halloween movies in October 🎃
I love the nod to halloween 3
Anyone else notice the masks the victims are wearing are from Halloween 3
I have watched this trailer atleast 5 times lol..
So excited to kill evil
Michael Myers vs world
Can't wait
This shit again? For fucks sake just let this franchise die. We get it, it’s serial killing simp with superpowers.
0:15 those Firemen are just doing their job ignore or don't know about a killer, Michael Myers
Am I the only one who sees the masks from halloween 3? no? good. also i think this is the final movie in the myers saga. because if it is, this will be an amazing conclusion.
The origin story of michael gave us the birth of serial killers and the spirit that drives men to unspeakable evil. Some of these monsters are actually kept like pets by a group. In part 4 they show us the cult that runs the world. They were present also in american psycho in the end when the real estate agent kicks him out. She's letting him know she's ok with what he is.
(From mrbeast)  Laurie: evil dies tonight  Michale: OH JIMMY
her ''Evil dies tonight'' Michael, you said that for the past 50 years I'm still here lol
Well this was a great movie. I will be sure and catch the extended version when it hits Netflix. I love that I can come to YouTube where they practically give away the whole damn movie in a trailer!
This 1 Looks Good
Why do they keep milking this franchise? The last movie was decent because Jamie was in it, but this one is purely a money grab and Jamie looks older than her years. Stop already or at least reinvent the franchise with an entirely new character (killer) instead of the same dude who has been killing and resurrecting himself since 1978.
Hi Michael
I do like how this trailer started out.
Halloween 2018 was a really great start on a new timeline.  Now, of Kills and Ends manage to succeed just as well, I'll be happy as ever.
Got to give credit to that fireman for trying to buzzsaw Michael
He didn't die? Oooh, what a surprise!
Watch how they put the last clip  Society vs Micheal
So this is basically a documentary on the defund the police movement. Since there is no police no swatt teams one man is allowed to kill without much resistance.
I'm so hyped!
"The more he kills, the more he transcends."  My boi Michael is just grinding EXP to level up!
I just watched the entire movie, thanks trailer.
Dead meat is gonna have a fun time counting these bodies
my mother has to see this damn movie
The song is fire
It would be cool to see him running for the first time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
Why wait for the movie when you can just watch the trailer
these mfs need to find out the magic of the assault rifle
Fire Department: We save lives  Michael Myers: so I just started stabbing
We just saw the entire movie on this trailer.
He don’t play on this
That Halloween reboot in 2018 was actually really pretty good. I remember being surprised and shocked by it. That scene in the public restroom... and the cast were really strong, including Sarandon and Robbin's son. Have to watch that again soon, before this comes out, which I may as well watch. Really waiting for Scream in 2022, but eh, some horror is good for one's disposition.
0:35 shot looks pretty cool ngl
:)
Laurie: EVIL DIES TONIGHT.  Michael:YOUR NOT THAT GUY PAL TRUST ME YOUR NOT THAT GUY.
Meh....
When Michael Myers brings No one escapes death
The scream Queen at it again! Jamie Lee is the G.O.A.T.!
For the love of fuck, will they please stop making Halloween movies?!
Michael fight all the people
Wait is his fingers still decapitated when laurie shoots his fingers in halloween 2018
Michael will never die , he is on every street corner , in our dreams , the person next door......... the rampaging lion ....
https://youtu.be/YASfcY-MARc
Since there's another sequel after this I wouldn't be surprised if Laurie says at the end:"forget what I said before. Evil dies next year"
It confuses me how even by himself, Michael could probably take on everyone in this town and still come out on top
I’m so excited for this. This looks better than the last one too (IMO) ... hope the community that comes together actually wins this!! 😩 can’t wait to watch!!!
is this film going to be on netflix?
The violin cover of the Halloween theme is SO FUCKING GOOD
When the firefighter started the chainsaw the director and producer should have played “don’t worry baby” by The Beach Boys
damn he is pissed i cant wait to see this in the theater
I hate how they act like Michael Myers is human because no human can survive a quarter of the things that he has
Michael Myers vs the entire f*cking town  I’m all for it.
One thing killers have all in common (Freddy, Jason, Chucky, and etc.) They all live.
He Still Not Goin To Die 💪🏾🤣
It’s easy to stop Michael in 2021.  Just tweet that his victims are mostly white.  He has no diversity.  How many gay/trans characters has he killed?  Michael is cancelled!  Now he can’t get you.
Actors Sandy Johnson and Dick Warlock from the Halloween franchise  have the absolute best names 😂
Other people when they think of Michael Myers: I love his white mask and he's a good slasher me: turururururururu tururururururu
Michael is more persistent than most bill collectors.
I’m usually a bitch when it comes to horror movies but I got the trailer as an ad so I’m actually kinda excited
No matter how fast you run Michael Myers always walks fast
I like how they included the mask from Halloween III.
This had 6.9 million views when I watched it
If it weren't for portraying healthy adult men as helpless and tiny women including a senior citizen as the baddest of all the asses, I'd be interested.
This is beyond
Dang I wish they shown the face
I'm a die hard Halloween fan And always will be 🎃💀🔪..I can't tell you how many times I'm going to watch this when this comes out. I'm so freaking hyped let's freaking goo😤
Trust me, He won’t die even this time😤😤
Holy shit they referenced Halloween 3. I really hope they have sliver shamrock as a company in this movie
Movie director: let’s make another movie  Michael: God damn it just let me die
U telling me yb can’t jus shoot his ass
I cannot wait 😍
I am going to be so excited to see this when it comes out in October
*city neighborhood gangs up on Michael* Michael: oh shit they serious
Did this little town just wage WAR on MICHEAL MEYERS?!?!? HELL YES!!!!!!
Search kiid888 🦋👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
I'm sorry but I think the old one is still scary
They should make a Michael Myers where he hunts down Soldiers like a COD theme
Laurie “evil dies tonight”  Michael “ that’s a bit harsh yk”
If you listen closely you can hear the crowd chanting, "Evil dies tonight!"
Im so irritated that Michael never dies!!! Like a whole team of firefighters couldn't fight him!
Wow. The whole movie is here. It was great! Thanks trailer-movie
They been trying to kill this dude since 78
Why is it named Halloween Kills because that sounds like it would be used for a title of video explaining how good Halloween is or talking about the kills.
hell no Not on a sunday night!
Even if he does die I'm 100% sure he'll come back as some zombie type of monster
You Can’t kill the bogeyman 😁🔪🎃
69 million views nice
The new theme music on the violin and other string instruments sounds awesome!! Soundtrack is gonna be a hit!
LETS GOOOOOO
Bruh why they keep remaking this movie over and over again smh they on that fast n furious shit
Damn that’s some high grade silicone
Use me as a like of you knew they would make another one and knew he survived the fire
I can’t wait.
Laurie is a badass, and that's okay, but seeing a granny going around all confident with a knife like that would look so fun without the contest lmao
I love Michael Myers bad
Well this gone be the last one huh
The trailer revealed too much in my opinion
I think that was Julian who said unlock the door. And I'm pretty sure his parents were the 2 dressed up as doctor n nurse
bro im a massive simp for Michael (don't come for me) and this comes out on my birthday          *looks like i got some good plans*
Rob zombie needs to do a Halloween 3!!!
I can't wait I love Michael Myers is bad ass
I’m so pumped for this!! Best horror series of all time. Iconic they should bring Tyler Mane back, I liked Zombies Michael
I know he better not have two whole hands in this movie
Im taking my boy's to see this one. October needs to get here quick. I found out that there is a new Friday the 13th coming out same month of this year.   Evil never die's. There is also talk's of a possible Jason vs Michael Myers.
Laurie: ‘evil dies tonight’  Michael: ‘LOL’
*Laurie walking through a crowded hallway with a rusty knife* everyone else in the hospital: it's not really my fuckin problem
they shouldve let it burn
My god this trailer scary😰
The Halloween 3 masks 👌
This looks good
I can't be the only 1 sick of these. Like come on no logical way this man wouldn't have gotten shot like 45 times already. It's not the terminator or sub zero issa dude with a knife. These movies dead to me imo lol
I am A producer And this was A healthy idea ❗
This whole series is a dumb concept.   Young kids manage to kill themselves with guns in America.  But trained adults can't shoot one guy who literally walks around town killing people with a knife.  Good thing i don't waste my money on this trash.
Wow scared 😨😳
Does nobody turn on the lights? Why would you walk in the dark?
I’m guessing his clothes are flame proof.
JUST STAHP ALREADY STAHHHP Jamie Lee killed it let’s move on
It seems James will have alot of bodies to count for his deadmeat video
1:40 this look of Michael looks so savage after they say: let's hunt him down
2:13 😱
"Let it Burn"!!! With bloody hell emotion scream out
That camera man has some serious servival skills
Saw this trailer in a ad and didnt brother to skip it. I wanna see this movie so bad
The camera man survives
2:15 is that nick castle wearing the costume?
Til this day I still continue to shit myself everytime I watch this trailer
I ALWAYS COME BACK 🔪🔪🔪
Really hoping the make this one unique and have the crowd actually kill Michael. Having the people band together to actually end the slasher once and for all is a pretty unique take that im surprised hasn't been done often.
I know Michael is supposed to be immortal or something, but youre telling me a group of firemen all armed with axes and saws couldn't gang up and kill/incapacitate him?
I know this is supposed to be a horror movie and all but the soundtrack got me super hyped up.
Who would of thought a 70 year old man could do so much damage
Are you.. actually, and factually sure about that. The chainsaw alone.. speaks for itself.
Lol
All these Halloween movies are great, and seem to get better, but is Halloween Ends the last one? I don't think so? They usually come back again.
The available saudi arabia infrequently soak because patio coincidingly drag along a knowing gym. enthusiastic, brief smash
Alright!! Glad their focusing on so much gore lol definitely gonna see this around Halloween 👍👍
Damn so he came back I like  it, it makes since how he survived, usual it’s women bs somebody wished him back or something stupid on a pre-k level.
Op
Just saw this trailer.  Horror films are not what they used to be .  Too cheesy and not scary .  Nothing beats the original and part II
Can I get a amen
if you look @ 1:33 you see the black couple from Halloween 2018 dressed up as a nurse and doctor dead on the roundabout!!
This trailer looks like it ruins a bunch of scenes...
*every firefighter disliked that*
Since baby my Dog love this shit🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃
The theme song  in Violin sounds classy af
The day after this came out, my fish died
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE!!!!!!
*sequel trailer* Me: another cringy sequel *From director John Carpenter* Me: I'll give it a chance
Cool, don't have to see the movie now as his escape and all the kills are in the trailer. Talk about a spoiler-riffic clip.
I don’t get what she’s talking about when she says “Michael Myers is flesh and blood. But a man couldn’t have survived that fire. The more he kills, the more he transcends,” ??  How has he proven himself to be supernatural. He took about as many wounds as Laurie, and clearly shows a fireman reaching his hand out to rescue him, and soon after kills the entire Haddonfield Fire Department. So why is she saying “No man could have survived that fire”? HE DID!   The only unrealistic supernatural element was when he killed off the entire fire department! Lol. That’s what she should be talking about . Ridiculous.
I'm guessing light bulb thru the throat must really sucks.
People actually wanna see this?  Oh Michael....what have they done to you.
🔥🔥
Everyone Gansta till Michael Myers comes at you with a halligan bar
Bro I’m glad the going to hunt him down fr
...
Can’t. Fuckin. Wait
S
Those Halloween 3 season of the witch masks looked pretty cool
YESSSUHHHH!!! I’m so there! I’ve been waiting with bated breath since the last one in 2018!!
https://youtu.be/n7-pY2OZjkE
Michael Myers is a menace lol
You could put this bloke through a blender and he would still come out the other end fine.
Jamie Lee Curtis: LET IT BURN Me: that's how i feel about my ex
Michale is evil!!
Tom Poole 🙌🔥🔥
Jamie lee Curtis vs Michael Myers, the most competitive standoff ever
Michael myers 🌞 sunmyers
Im excited for this movie but they gave away too much in this trailer.
This actually might be the last one!!! Idk.   *pauses*   Hahahahahah yeah right!  I said that on the last one and yet here we are.  😂😂
Who would have thought that when the original came out in 1978, 43yrs later the boogie man would still be around🤷‍♂️
“I’m not gonna sit and watch another innocent person die.” So stand.
This movie is so funny because at the start the house was burnt down and the house was burnt down 3 years ago they should've died right
A mother, daughter and a granddaughter going up against a 60 year old man. Vin Diesel would be proud that a family of three are going after a killer that killed a family member
At the beginning of the trailer the house burning look so fn awesum
Another Halloween film wen are they gna give up with this is this all it's ever going to be just reboot everything generation after generation this is it cuz ur always going to get a new young audience but wen u get older it's like oh this again but this how it's going to be forever in 3021 Michael will still be killing everyone jamie lee will keep getting killed then coming back for the next one saying that she is his relative so if he can live forever why can't she lol October 4021 Michael returns in Halloween in space this time he's killing life on other planet's or some sh*t like that.... the world will be a different place by then hopefully a better place with no reboots of the same old sh*t
this is how the 2018 one ended!
This better be good.
Wow so orginal
The person on the moon be like: 👁👄👁
Now this is my type of movie,I'm excited to watch this 😆
I've always wondered how horror movie villains would handle mob violence. They always get the benefit of picking off victims one by one but not this time.
I can’t wait for this‼️
You ever see a whole town come together just to die
This looks so cool
Know Michael myers yes
6.6M views. 50% of which is by me.   I should stop watching this trailer.
Michael Myers the beast
6.6 mill people bout to watch this
I cannot lie this looks really really good !!!!
2:21  Her:"YOU WANT YOUR MASK COME AND GET IT!! Michael: *just starts sprinting at full speed*
I cannot wait to see this!
sweet
I feel like I just saw the whole movie. Pass
jus end him already
Holy Shit! The SILVER SHAMROCK masks shows up in the trailer.
I feel like I watched the whole movie, watching this trailer 😆...least allthe good parts
Why would you need to see the movie after this trailer shows you every kill and every key plot point?
The entire trilogy: Halloween (original) Halloween 2018 Halloween Kills Halloween Ends (Apparently this is the title of the final movie I nabbed from a news source)
Rob zombies take on michael myers is still the best sorry
maykıl. olum sen rahatsız mısın aileni öldür, ne bileyim husumetli olduğunu öldür trafikte magandayı öldür de itfayeci gardaşımı niye psikopatça öldürüyorsun kamil. bide adamlar hayatını kurtardı. çok ayıp ettin çok. bu olmadı işte bak bu olmadı. üzdün.
Michael's mask looks like William Shatner.
So he's super strong now
To all the fans out there, he probably doesn’t die cause I looked up all the movies and there is one in 2022 called Halloween ends
I hope it’s great but the trailer looks stupid! It’s making Michael look like Jason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
I want to see Michael fall in love. Next movie, maybe.
I'ts 2021 but he's still alive 🙃😅
Wait a COVID minute, he fkd around came back at wrong X. Inoculations already begun and PEAK will be here before he’s released. And if it’s not ZOMBIE filmed I’m not gonna not vaccinate for it
After watching this trailer, I'll be rooting for Michael...
Whos excited if you excited say "YAY" in the comment
OMG!.He will bring you death.It's the most creepy movie.
Michael learns to Kill next title
Is no one gonna mention the Season of the Witch masks???
Thank you firefighters  Now die  -Halloween kills : coming soon-
I don’t even like horror/slasher movies and this is exiting lol
Holy shit.
Can we just declare trying to engage Michael in hand to hand combat is an exercise in futility?
This nigga walk 90 miles per hour 🤣🤣
The people who disliked are his next victims
So excited
Laurie : Evil dies tonight Michael :  Nothing can stop me I'm all the way up( Beat comes in )
Laurie: "Evil dies tonight"  Michael: "fucking bit-"
I really wonder how Halloween Ends will end everything because Halloween 2018 Is about Laurie vs Michael, Halloween Kills is Haddonfield vs Michael, I just wonder if Halloween Ends would take place back at smiths grove or maybe somewhere else rather then Haddonfield
Can't wait to go to the theaters for this
This looks badass
Continuing 2018 one
Evil dies tonight: she has been saying that for 40 years
How many more times is he gonna survive
Hot take. The whole he can’t hurt anyone ever again is at the END of the movie and so is the dude saying Michael Myers is alive!!!
I can't wait I WANNA SEE IT NOW!!!
Why do trailers nowadays reveal so much?!
This movie: Michael dies Sequal: Michael lives again  It never ends...
They gave away too much in this trailer...
I hope they explain why he spared the baby in Halloween 2018
Who's ready for Halloween kills Michael Myers is back
I know Jamie lee Curtis and micheal Myers is tired of carrying these movies on their backs.😭😭😭😭
I dont get this Franchise. How hard is It to shoot this Guy and the wohle Thing is over......
Idk why they didn’t do gens. Should’ve brought Dwight with his prove thy self. Yet again Michael would just have NOED and an ebony mori. Laurie low key hit them Decisive strikes tho can’t lie.
Might be another classic lmao
When is it releasing
I can't wait for this to come out 👌👌👌I'm There
No not the black lady that's racist
the end ?
I am so hyped
Evil never dies
Is this real?
Looks dope but i wish i hadn't watched this trailer. They done gave away the whole movie smh
They got so much blood and evil and it now
Epic horrifying and thriller movie with so much killing
That movie is going to be awesome
I can’t wait!!!
Im not gon be able to take this 🗣 ✋🏾Im coming Elizabeth!!💀
Laurie: Evil dies tonight. Michael: Oh, I don't think so.
I can’t wait until the movie comes out
Just kill em already dammit
Was that Kyle Richards I saw 🙂🙂🙂 2:01
That whole town needs to clean that noed totem
How old is michael by now?
Omg what that’s insane
Have they tried anti tank rounds at all? I mean they work magic.
Holy shit 💪
The best parts of the movie are in this trailer.
I can't wait to see this joint!
Haven’t we all had enough 😩
This is stupid lol & how tf he out lives that kills about 3-4 firefighters and one with chainsaw lol
Put a black or brown mask on him.. I bet he would get lit up
bro how isn’t he dead.....
Haddonfield is very diverse.
Mike is Pushing close to 80 years old and still Killing people because he missed Halloween back in the seventies .all he wants is some candy just give Some candy and he probably go away.
Oh my Im so ready for this movie!!!
I only hope the revenge of our dear murderer 📈
The hanging body at 1:37 is the woman in the car at 1:58
Did I just see Anthony Michael Hall
Micheal never dies 😭🤣 … this is gonna be so good 🔥
OH MY FUCKING GOD
Nice I'm so glad they have the pick axe kill similar to My Bloody Valentine 3D except this is in the beginning not the end lol
Here is a link to one of the Faithful Poems videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKkib5xyjsQ
Thanks to this trailer I don't need to watch the movie no more
Laurie: Evil dies tonight Dying since 80'....
Michael Myers stats  Fire Resistance : +95  Damage: +100  Stealth: + 90  Strength: +100  Defense: +100  Speed: -50
This is something I been looking forward to
I thought JLC didn't want to be on this franchise anymore?
I love how they incorporated Halloween 3 masks into this movie. Seasons of the witch was such an underrated movie
EVIL MUST DIE!!!
This looks fantastic. I really enjoyed the reboot but somehow this trailer makes it seem like this one is gonna be x10’s better than Halloween (2018)
This will be epic !!
This is going to be AMAZING!!
Omg I can't wait for Halloween kills. Huge Halloween fan. Laurie needs to go out with michael it started with michael and her it needs to end with them both in Halloween ends. Either the granddaughter or daughter need to die in this movie and then Laurie goes with michael in Halloween ends. This movie is gonna be awesome in my opinion. Love Halloween. ❤❤💓💕💛💖💜💙💜💚💝💚💞💟💞❣favorite horror slasher ever.
When I saw this as an ad, I thought it was an ad for a FNAF movie at first and I pissed my pants
I'm smiling thru the whole trailer
Universal just said, “fuck it, well pirate it ourselves”
Did you die. Sadly yes... but I lived!
Kyle Richards ?
So, they didn’t think the fire department would come ?
“THE LONGER MICHEAL IS ON EARTH THE STRONGER HE WILL BECOME!”
HYPEEE
Yessss Cant Wait
THOSE ASKING THE DIRECTOR.......look no further than the ORGINAL creator himself. John Carpenter. NONE of the other Halloweens are on these movies timelines. he was and is the original director of the one who made us 80's babies fall in love with this menace. The REASON they sequence together like they will, is due to him, these are the REAL Halloween movies.
I can’t wait untill this comes out
Disgonbegood.jpg
This is gonna be terrible
At least michael is keeping safe from the virus look hes wearing his mask lol
It appears the leaked script I read matches what I'm seeing here.
There's something that bugs me in this trailer. That guy with the map, the one who says following the paths of victims leads straight to Michael's home? That.....sounds off to me somehow.  Think about it; all this time Michael has been proven to have NO rhyme or reason to his killing. No pattern, no preferred targets, no psychological rituals to it. Just random murder, acts of pure evil. But for him to intentionally leave a path leading to his own home like that? It seems PLANNED to me somehow. I don't think going back home is his goal at all, just something he's tricking them into believing he has a pattern. Something they can predict.  Even with the whoile town hunting him down, Myers is still the hunter. And I think he's setting his trap.
I’m so FUCKING excited
This is what happens when you defund the police. You get incompetent cops who can't stop a killer who has no peripheral vision.
The last person who was take a knife against Myers find his end like a picture in the wall.
Damn!!😱😱
Enough already.   Loved the last movie, this seems interesting..........., but please die at the end.   Everyone should die.   It a massive explosion.  That way nobody can come back, or can they?  Hahahaha.
“Evil dies tonight”  Everybody Who Already Knows This Is Part 2 Of A Trilogy: *“Yeah totally. Its definitely gonna happen this time”*
Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!
Looks like we gonna be getting some motherfucking amazing kills HYPED AS FUCK!
No cap
Michael Myers is my dad
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=183s
Sheeeesh this movie is finna slap
Movie looks sick. Y'all Check out Tom McDonald tomorrow 🔥
These movies are dumb.
🤤🤤🤤❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🌹🌹🌹
Jesus feels like I just seen the whole movie 🤣💀💀
"What do we do?" "We fight!" "Let's hunt him down!"  Well it hasn't worked the other 50 million times but it surely will now!  Say what you want about the residents of Haddonfield but you can't fault their optimism
Thats a ,trailer' ?? Garbage
At least Michael is STILL wearing his mask
Everyone at 1:41  “How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man?!”
When does it come out
Could've swore he burned in the basement 😅
Pp poo
The cinematography looks clean ! Almost like Tarantino had something to do with this
Evil dies tonjajfjefhssjlagcwueocj🔪
This is it!
are we really still doing this
Sadly the last movie was horrible, this is just a cash cow at this point. Only saw it because I'm such a huge fan. So disappointing! There's no point in seeing this one. This is my favorite horror movie of all time(the first one, couple of other along the way), but they just kept going. I'm sure all my OG horror fans will agree. It's going to be recycled version of every other horror movie we've seen. Only thing that makes it good is that it has Michael Myers. Ugh!
if only Jason Voorhees was still alive and not 6 feet in the ground to fight Michael would've been a dope movie... Jason is stronger but not Immortal Michael has the strength of a normal human but is Immortal...
Wow thx put the full video on youtube please 🥺🥺🥺🥺
Michael myers.  Aka Austin Powers
I'm so over it
I wonder if Michael will actually say something this time...🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Laurie " Michael look at the flowers !!!
Is it just like a thing to have Laurie be in a hospital in every second movie?
The last film was at military school in SC
The last movie was at my school in SC
I can’t wait I’m soooo ready for the movie
Had to turn my head away, don’t wanna spoil the kills
I came here to rewatch this trailer because I dreamed about Michael meyers 🤦‍♂️😭😬he terrified me in my sleep.
firefighter: GRAB MY HAND! stalky boi: okie :3
Superrrrrrr se bhi uperrrrrrrrr👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥beyond comments❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️  #MusicalSayantani
Anzio 20mm rifle bet ya this will stop him xD
This is more exciting than the 2018 one
Miramax is back
I‘m excited! literally can’t wait to watch this in theaters. Feels good to be back to "normal"
This trailer shows too much, it's hardly worth watching now.
Just loop him.
I’m so pumped for this movie
My girl jamie lee keeping with the series  Love it
To the fire fighters: You just had to respond to that call, did you?
Quem mais do Brasil ? Nos Estados Unidos as Universidades Abrem de madrugada igual nos filmes Americanos de terror e suspense ?
Burst
So this will be out in October, just when the next lockdown is unleashed in the UK?
Love the callback to Halloween 3!
Now that's a bad-ass fire team
See if Michael Meyers keeps his mask on
Lame and repetitive
"Im Comming For You Michael...."
:D :D :D thats why world going crazy watch this shit
So Michael Myers pretty much becoming  John Wic everyone after him and he’s taking them out one by one 🤦🏻
Yes please !!! As long as Jamie Lee is there, so am i
Imagine thinking you can kill Myers
Chanting:EVIL DIES TONIGHT EVIL DIES TONIGHT
For anyone who doesn’t understand what the mob is chanting   They are saying EVIL DIES TONIGHT
That trailer was fire🔥🕺🏿
perma tier 3 michael monkaW
But a man couldn’t survive that fire
I’m scared right now.
Why have they never just sent a load of policemen to shoot him, like I get he’s a big bloke and all but bloody hell just kill him already
Looks worse than the 2018 version lmao
I can't wait!!
Laurie: Evil dies tonight Michael: I said the same thing before I gutted the director of Halloween 3....
"He's the essence of evil" I cant put in words how hyped i am
Some things are just not meant to continue... AKA Halloween 5, rob zombie Halloween 2, and this garbage pile of dumpster fire
Just fucking stab him for like a hour than choke him for a couple minutes that’s it
Who else saw the Halloween 3 references
Woah...
Michael is gonna be fucking brutal here and i love it.
With thanos by my side i'll be good thanos can just snap him out of existence hehehehehe
Danny McBride is the co-star and co-writer? Was he in the trailer?
It’s over bois, he gonna facecamp those hooks
With family we can beat Michael
With family we can beat Michael
No more.  Good bye, Michael and John.
Ahhh.. I have watched all of these Halloweens over and over! I love these.. they are scary!
This looks like such a good movie and it has an interesting concept with Laurie having a manhunt on Micheal. With blumhouse behind it makes it even better because the director will have so much freedom with this movie.
Just imagine what Catwoman would do to him
When the hands of fate Fall on the midnight hour Behind this mask of hate I don the devil's power If there's life in the shadows Let the knife leave its mark When the certainty of safety feels like stabbing Stabbing in the dark
Michael is back boys
Evil dies tonight  Bully Myers: "I missed the part where thats my problem."
Anyway i started stabbing
Michael Myers has been chasing jamie lee Curtis since 1978.. She’s got to be emotional drain.. And just cause she say EVIL WILL DIE TONIGHT, isn’t happening.. You really think these directors will actually finally kill Michael 😂.. Not happening..
Fkn HEll Give IT a REST already .... dont you think its been LONG enough ?????
Ok this is gonna be dopee!!
I at least watch this once or twice a day lmaoo, the hype is real!
Not a lot of people are gonna see this movie but at least the fans are here
Thanks you've shown almost every kill in the movie. Niw i won't yave to pay for it lol geesh.
After thousands attempts to end his reign of terror this time she’s packing a Ginsu!  That’ll show him!!!
6.3 million in 1 week damn😳
Let's make this the first Billion Dollar horror film!!!
Myers has to be in his late sixties by now right? All them dead  bodies keeping him young and vibrant go get em Mike 🪓⛏🗡🩸⚰
they’re still making halloween movies?😭
didin"t he loose his fingers lol
Mike just ain’t dyin’
The ultimate Who cares-movie.
I am pretty sure We all know he’s not dead and they’ll make a new one in 2024 🥰
What is the crowd chanting?
With my grandchildren we began to see Halloween 1978 on Yootube, and Halloween 2018 on Netflixx, and I told them, lucky they did not have to wait 40 years and see 10 sequels that they erased suddenly, and this 2021 direct to the 3rd installment of this line of time.  Con mis  nietos nos pusimos a ver Halloween 1978 en Yootube, y Halloween 2018 en Netflixx , y  les dije, afortunados no tuvieron que esperar 40 años y ver 10 secuelas que borraron de golpe, y este 2021 directo a la 3ra de entrega de esta linea de tiempo.
We've already learned that a little fire isn't enough to take out the damn boogeyman
Season of the witch callback, i hope we see the silver shamrock
Yessssss can’t wait
Next year: MICHAEL MYERS STABS.  2023:Halloween Trick or Treat
This is gonna be good and watch universal Studios is gonna have a ride for this
Can’t wait for it to come out I’m so happy
Oh no ..
Dis gon be GOOD!
I. Hyped for this movie
*you want ur mask come and get it*
Can’t wait to see the next four Halloween movies after this…
Been watching these series since I was 9yrs old. my bday falls on 10/31 best horror series ever. If Jamie lee Curtis wasn't apart of the newer series, it would be trash period!! So excited!!
Michael: Evil Dies Twice
In the movie Halloween from 2018 it took over 30 min. until someone was killed! In Halloween Kills I guess it wont take even three minutes ;-)!
The hunter becomes the hunted
why cant they just use army forces he will be stopped much faster and more guns would be usefull and and theres a  protest or raid and they all get guns simple as that movie would be like 50 minutes long if they all had guns and were much smarter simple
Looks dumb af
I’m so exited for this honestly!
Hopefully she does kill him for good regardless of how people see him and also i hope the movie people do not kill her off which i see them doing another halloween movie with the can't die why do people like him michael myers.
Jason Voorhees is better
Nice 🍿
ʜᴇ's ᴛʜᴇ ᴇssᴇɴᴄᴇ ᴏғ ᴇᴠɪʟ
Why the firefighters in the house tho
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
Looks like micheal brought noed and both his iridescent addons to haddon field this year
I can't believe Michael didn't survive everything I've watch Halloween 1 this year it was released on 1978 till 2019 own series  and he didn't die wow he is unstoppable
I swear I never been so scared in my life except when Michael starts fast walking brah u would think he gon be slow like other killers but this man will fast walk u down
In all Michael life he only liked one person and didn’t try to kill him and that was the crazy boy in the nut house that wore the clown mask that was obsessed with Michael and admired him
THE MUSIC IS SO HYPE
Can't wait!!
I honestly hope Michael wins at this point.
October needs to hurry up and get it's ass over here!
Only 3 months and 3 weeks till this movie comes out
I’m so f#*kin hyped for this movie
FFS how many more.
can yall please stop with mike myers. rest in pieces already, I've been watching these since they first came out. which tells my age. really stop it!😭
Badass action and horror work well together.
You can't kill evil you can only hurt it
So excited.
This looks AWESOME 👏🏾
Probably the most gruesome movie from this serie so far
0:33  POV: your thinking how the fuck you alive my G
Wonder if William Shatner gets paid for every Halloween movie.
I love horror movie's like this
Omg! Im so ready! My favorite all time! Come on  Jamie Lee and Micheal! Yessss! In my Myers mask dancin!😱😳😁😭
sic traillllll!111!!!!111!!111!! ;)))0000))_!!!!
They keep calling him the personification or essence of evil but he left a baby alive in the last film, I would think pure evil would kill a baby.
Thanos vs Michael. Do not debate me.
I was always kind to you Michey...
Still think they should make a Michael Myers vs Jason Voorhees movie! That would be sick!!!
So much ruined in this trailer. Thanks for showing how Myers escapes
Who else noticed that house was from 2018 when laurey put Michael in the bunker the gas turned on and she threw a light stick that caught on fire burning down the house.
Ohhhh shiiiitttt she’s got the butcher knife 🔪 on herrr sideeee whole lotta mikey shit goin onnnnn
I’m so pumped for this
From the preview it look trash
I’ve been trying to tell everyone, they will never kill him, BUT what they can do is break the curse of thorn. Supposedly that is the reason he is what he is, so I foresee him killing Laurie and Karen trying to break the curse, and Allyson will be one of the only remaining characters in Halloween ends, and the rest will be left up to her
I’ve never been more excited to see a movie in my life
he’s turning more into DBD Michael Myers and it’s scaring me
I had no idea this movie was coming I saw this on a YouTube advert before a video and was like “no it can’t be, it can’t be!” 😂 so hyped
Robert Englund is 74 now so please hurry up and give us Freddy vs Jason vs Michael before it's too late. In the movie they all end up killing each other and get sent to hell forever. And then right at the end when we think all the legends have died and peace is restored on Earth, the camera slowly pans to the Leatherface sitting in an old chair in his living room listening to the Jeepers Creepers song on a gramophone with a Chucky doll sitting on the couch next to him and then the Chucky doll comes to life, turns his head to Leatherface and says "Wanna play?" before cutting to black.
If only one those firemen had been Busta... Michael would've gotten a can of whoop ass.
I have never even watched any of the Halloween movies and this trailer sent a chills up my spine  ‘I’m coming for you Micheal’
0:03 This is Halloween,not Friday The 13th. Universal.S messed up!
I SOO CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE I AM SO HYPED
Laurie: "Evil dies tonight" Michael: "So anyways, I started stabbing"
This looks so good
Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
I’m so hyped
I like the trailer music
this looks unbelievably stupid.  and that's saying an awful lot, considering the last 6 or 7 Halloween movies.
Damn I feel like I watched the whole movie with this spoiling ass trailer
At this point they just might have to strap a bomb to him
FUCK ME HE LIVED
I hate horror but I’m watching thin on god
Hype
Really? Another one? Make up an original
What if Michael Myers is not just a human, but a vessel for Samhain put in there by the Silver Shamrock druids, thus, making Season of the Witch finally canon, also cementing Laurie's line "the more he kills, the more he transcends" to have more weight.
They should make a Jason vs Michael film!
Laurie: “Evil dies tonight.”  Michael: haha u thought lelelelel noob
I can't wait
I guess Michael got pissed when he found out there would be no more shrek movies so he decided to become a killer
If this was Michael Myers vs Dom Torreto,  Dom wins you know why?  Family… Dom has family, thats why.
This film is going to have the biggest cliffhanger in existence.
I just had a feeling when Halloween first came out when I was leaving the movies I said I no he not dead
A town vs micheal Myers love it
He's very pissed off he's on hus way to see you guys keep your doors locked on October 31
Grace from Beyond the Trailer should definitely see the trailer of Halloween Kills
Michael: Imma kill this family  *Vin Diesel(Dom) has entered the chat
lol
Michael is about to body that whole town
I said " if he is still alive IDGAF " and I meant it... fuck these movies !
this is not halloween kills this is november kills
Laurie : evil dies tonight   Dom Toretto : we will fight for our family
SO FUCKING HYPED FOR THIS! 👹
At this point i want to see Michael Myers vs the avengers
Did blumhouse have anything to do with the last newest one. Because honestly the rob zombie ones have been my favorite for awhile now but blumhouse does some good shit.
Wtf is the crowd chanting?
Man, something about seeing firefighters getting brutally killed is actually heartbreaking. but somehow I see it happen to cops in these movies and I don't give a shit.
Michael god
That god damn house is still standing????
At this point just throw him in a meat grinder, feed the meat to a pack of dogs,  put the dogs in a pit of gasoline then set it on fire, then dump the ashes in the Mariana Trench.
That trailer spoiled everything but the ending.
Could universal just stop making sequels for just a second
definitely have to see
DEFINITELY WATCHING THIS MOVIE
FAMILY💀
Omgggg fuckkkk Yessss I'm excited for this 🔥🔥🔥
Michael is so evil even the reaper dies in his presence ...
Trailer should have ended exactly at 2:18.
Looks like it might be good. One a serious note those firefighters would have owned his ass in reality.
Best slasher of all times
Spoiler Alert:  Michael is Laurie's Father.
10 movies of trying to kill Michael, then trapping him under a house to burn Alive in the 11th movie.  Michael: “And I took that personally”
It was a drought on good horror films but Halloween came and saved the day lol
I’m
This dude's really going to merk an entire city.
Brooooo LETS GOO lol 😳😆🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I’m glad they kept the storyline parallel to the previous ones! and they didn’t put a year on the release so it gotta be dropping this year!
Damm micheal was just chillin out inside tha burning house thats crazy he's survived that he's still got sum killer left in him his old ass...
No trial, no jail cell and no arrests. It's about damn time the ppl takes the fight to Michael!!!!
Firefighters 10 to 1, Michael Myers: Never tell me the odds
First time human tries to hunt evil
This movie might be perfect if they would add the guy that played "Ronnie" from Rob Zombie's Halloween. 😆
Can’t wait to see him again
I like how the army and military are not a thing in this movie lol they can clearly shot him with a sleepy shot than trap him in a cement cage where he can't even escape and burn him THE END
The violin version of the Halloween theme is just amping up the tension, as it should. Plus you have all of Haddonfield finally joining up with Laurie to go after Michael. Oh, shit.
Michael is 60 years old takes on all the fire fighters takes on a whole town and is doing all this just to kill Laurie
Transcending to immortality.
Micheal is literally the devil himself. She must die in order for him to die. She is the last sole survivor
Ah the legend himself has returned
Claire Redfield vibes @1:31
This is going to  be good I can't wait!!!
Looks dope af
Michael is definitely pissed
I cant be the only one who noticed the halloween 3 masks at 1:32
From a Michael Myers fan since birth 1986, I beg of the film makers and the creators to pls keep him alive for god sake! If y’all end this I’m going on strike lmao
Get”em mike all of them
While I still love it, this trailer kind of threw water on my theory. My theory was gonna be (from earlier teasers and whatnot) that the firefighters were gonna get to the house, find Michael and save him (as is their moral obligation to do). They were gonna take him to the hospital, treat him and handcuff him and secure him to his bed. Then when you see the people chanting and rioting outside (with that scene with the ambulance), my thinking was people were rallying to go into the hospital to kill Michael but the staff and police wouldn't allow it so the whole place got shut down but someone (Laurie or whoever) breaks in, attacks Michael but he comes to, is able to break free and continues his rampage. This trailer definitely shows that is not the case but it was a good theory while it lasted.
She been coming for him since since '78 😂. How about get that shit right this time.
When are they taking out scream 5? tho
After halloween part 2, Jamie Lee left the series to avoid her career being type cast. In 2021 this series is her career..
1 moment I have hopes it could be decent, the next moment I have no hopes lol and then it just keeps goin back and forth
The only one he fears is John Wick.
The Halloween 2018 Continues
I see references to H3 in the comments. It always struck me as funny when considering how many hands this franchise has ended up in as far as film companies. And it's no surprise when the Weinsteins and others of their tribe started pushing it in the direction of "clandestine shadow cults" running the world behind the scenes. Oh, but of course... It's a bunch of Celtic Druids right? 😂😂
This Should Be a RainBow Six Siege Trailer 💀
1:33 That's my favorite reference
I don’t know why but I really want Myers to win and this to be a bad ending
can’t wait to see this!!!
2:00 the amount of force that Michael used to slam Lindsey’s head is traumatizing.
ヽ(｡◕o◕｡)ﾉ.
Good job fire fighters, just feed him Tier 3 why don't you
Bro the music is fire
"Stahp you have a knife in your stomach!"  lmao bro what is this
Unless Michael kills John Wick’s dog… he isn’t gonna die
this man ain’t giving up till he kill Laurie fr 😭😭
If only Dr. Loomis was still alive
40 years later he still not dead what is the issue come on now
@1:33 Silver Shamrock masks, nice! I can't believe they stuck in my brain all these years. lol.
Season of the Witch nod!
michael pls stop get some help
Hot wheels zotic 2002 mattel 21 mil
Hot wheels zotic 2002 mattel 21 mil
What's next  Halloween - Michael Breaks a nail
This is going to be the best slasher of all time
Let this franchise DIE
At this point, Laurie gon die of natural causes by the time they kill Michael ass
how're you gonna show us the whole movie in a PREVIEW
0:35 reminds me of when Loomis was like “Hell will not have him.” Good stuff 👌
This one finna slap🚫🧢 the last one in 2018 was a banger gon be hard to top it buh wit the kills I seen in this one I got high hopes for this sequel
This fuck walks faster then people run
I can’t wait to watch this movie does it come out on Halloween
Has no one mentioned the SIlver Shamrock Masks?  What are they teaching in these schools?!
already success credits to the producers!
how much can a trailer spoil, my god
"LET IT BURN!"  I think they were talking about the Halloween franchise.
Bro why the fire fighter screaming in lower case 😂
0:33 just run for fuck's sake and don't keep it watching!!!!
The fact that Michael has Been stabbed, hung, drugged, ran over, shot, and blown up...and he is still not dead is beyond me...well that is what the shape does
At this point I don’t know when this series will end lol
How you gonna put the firefighters death in there
Michael, like the Doom Slayer, is too angry to die
Spoilers, Spoilers, Spoilers, Spoilers, Spoilers........
Its bullshit he didn't burn alive
I want Michael Myers to win!
Omg can’t wait
"Evil dies tonight" You are so hilarious, Michael is coming for you
These movies are getting dumber and dumber
Feel like I’ve seen the film now.
this will be epic
This is gonna be real fun.
Ima be so sad when theres no more Myers movies releasing 😥
The scariest thing is that they keep making this crap.

Well, at least we have an explanation on why Micheal won't die. He's so draconic, and evil that killing revives him.
I don't get it...... Will this be the end ??
The director of this trilogy of Halloween films is making Michael an unstoppable force and this film looks badass
Just make the man Super human or a zombie or something you keep killing him and giving us reasons on how he survives Ik a Cat has 9 lives and Michael Myers do to
Feel like I've just watched the whole god damn movie........... Why show so much mannnnnn
Why am I so excited to see them actually put up a BIG fight against michael MAN DUDE ITS GONNA BE LIT its like halloween 4 but better I cant wait!
Can’t wait seems awsome that there hunting him down the other way around so it’s going to be more of a chase to kill him and survive in the way
I really don't like the direction this has gone. Michael's lack of motivation, and selective stalking, made him oddly complex, now he's just another voorhees. I unironically think they should reboot H3 Season of the Witch instead of this crap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=5s
Jamie lee Curtis trying to turn into Loomis though is kinda annoying.. but otherwise can't wait
I Lindsey Wallace.
Kako će Michael pronači Marion Chambers.
Hollywood is so original
When are we ever going to see michael vs jason?
I really hope he finally kills Laurie Brutally and with no more significance than anyone else he kills.
boring the same story 100 times. BS
The firefighter scene looks like the intro to the devils rejects, except michael nips that twist in the butt!!!
Captain of a cult, with an elite following To turn Halloween back to a trick or treat holiday,have Michael Myers looking like a liar swipe his powers, replace his knife with flowers and a stack of flyers.
Man this is cool and all but I never understood how you let Micheal catch get you when he's literally casually walking up to you like.... RUN.
Jaime Lee Curtis's character cannot kill Myers...even though he's her brother...at some point the sequel needs to hit a conclusion...as hard as it was to kill Jason....the trilogy ends eventually.....at some point Meyers has to die...and stay dead......and if he is human why do he keep surviving???? Lets see his face.....hell we seen the hideous face of Jason Voorhees....lets see if Michael is really human or not.....theyve managed to hide his face for 40 years.
Same here Justlostwinner same here i'm excited man
They don't make movies like this anymore
who else wants michael to live
Trash trash trash movies .....stop regurgitating this story and all the other famous horror's which had their day 30 years ago!!
Boring.
Any Michael nerds can confirm? This is staying true to the og Michael or that's just some the made up
The whole town vs Michael
Lol he ain’t never gonna die
it they dont shoot, behead and burn him at the end of this movie I am done with the franchise.
Holy fuck this movie looks awesome.
I can't understand anything
Does Laurie forget he was shot multiple times and he’s been stabbed, thrown off from heights and she thinks a knife will stop him 😂, he just wanted Laurie and went through anyone who tried to stop him but Laurie has to go out and make a family so Michaels list just got bigger, could have stopped him by now if they just give him Laurie years ago 😅
He,s back from the 1900s and into 2021
Who would've guessed he would survive. Damn this movie finnr be litt
Can’t wait
Those Season of the Witch masks are a nice Easter Egg, I like that they're giving it some recognition, and the way this seems to continue immediately after part 1 is great, just like the original two movies (I would love to forget Halloween IV onwards so don't correct me about that thank you very much)
ke mamil
Why is he not at camp crystal lakes anymore ?
Bro just doesnt die LoL
OMG i can't wait super fan always have been (Stevie Davis)
y does this never get boring,..we r so weak :)
I’m SO EXCITED! I don’t care if they make a Michael Myers’ film every Halloween, I’m watching! 😍😍😍
这是什么电影
To old this story boring. Move on he ain't scary anymore.
😍😍🎃
Omggggg
At least in this movie, it looks like half the city coming for Michael vs the usual couple people and I bet they still won't kill him lol
No fucking way it’s continues from the last one 😍
shit just got real
John Carpenter should read The Entity Phylum book and make it a movie too.
This is corny. he's super human now? 🤭
I just hope they didn’t reveal too much in this trailer compared to the actual movie footage like they did the last one... any-who I’m still STOKED!!!!!!!!!
Laurie: "Evil, dies, tonight " Michael: "And I took that personally"
I, CANNOT, WAIT.
https://youtu.be/mL7-GYufTc8
Ansioso por verla
We're gonna need a "Fight back nigga" moment in the movie. Townspeople just beating his ass for roughly 2-3 minutes then he gets his comeback.
who cares? doja cat is better
https://youtu.be/Zn32ek5-K34
Aside from Jamie Lee Curtis the females are going to kill this movie
Anyone else notice the Shamrock masks from Halloween 3?
AW HELL YEAH
Ooooo oroeoereore
It looks absolutely amazing and so detailed I’m so hyped to see the strodes absolutely f up Michael myers
What a terrible looking movie.
Is last movie of Halloween?
So hyped for this movie but this trailer spoiled a lot of kills TBH.
Michael Myers, Jason and freddy teacher....
When is Michael going to finally die already lol. The dude is old enough to be my grandpa 🤣
Local man ruins everything.
Michael couldn't be stop even in a mist of the world's deadliest pandemic. Corona never hit Hollywood for all I can see 🙄
I just have seen the entire movie in a trailer, for fuck's sake
Here we go!!
Damn I miss rob zombie 🤷🏼‍♂️
Teaming up on my man's 😂🐐
What’s the music called?????
The labored cicada univariately disapprove because inventory grossly fire astride a rampant sister-in-law. crabby, fortunate cocktail
Oh yes it’s abt damn time
You can't Kill the Boogy Man!!!Michael Myers is the ultimate Movie killer!!!
I WAS WATCHING CUTE KITTY CATS WITH MY 2 YEAR OLD AND THIS TRAILER CAME UP AS AN ADVERTISEMENT. WHAT THE FÙCK. LET ME SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER
IT IS AMAZING!
i love helloween kills 😍😍😍
1:33 Halloween III masks ? 😅😅😅
The trailer is so amazng
Hello Halloween.       Again.
Awesome. Please make more movies. Why dont you make 1 movie for each year?
Old ones will always be better
Halloween movies r getting too good
The Best Too Ever Do It In My Eyes No Disrespect Too The Others But MICHAEL MYER Is A Different Breed 🐐🐐🐐🔥🔥🔥 My Favorite & GREATEST Serial Killer Of All Time 🐐🐐
Ah yes! Another one for my lovely collection! One more for when I do my “Halloween” marathons! (Except for #3 though lol)
When I Say & I Mean This On Everything This Will Be The Best Serial Killer Too Watch Of All Time I Mean This With A Passion 🐐🐐🔥🔥 Killer Mike 💯💯🐐🐐
So can't wait for this, easily the best horror franchise ever made!!
I’m soo happy for this
So did Michael kill the guy who fell down into the ground,I love that the firefighters grabbed weapons and tried to fight back
Idk I feel like they showed too much in this trailer
Crazy to think that’s his baby sister
Myers more dangerous than a Terminator!! Maybe the should put him up against the Predators!!
Don't need to see the film now that I've seen most of the "Michael Killings". Talk about total spoiler alert LOL
The remixed theme song though I’m super excited!!
no fckin mercy
“58 sequels later”                                        Laurie: it ends tonight.                                   Oh boy
Wait I’m actually excited holy fuck
So a big group of People, Gang up on Michael?? Thats fucking Bad Ass
Laurie need to become a priestess and learn how to exorcise evil
Such a good trailer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
Looks good. Still pissed how the cancelled out the OG ones
Hopefully more micheal scenes and less mediocre character development for the background characters
So I rewatched the trailer and everyone is wondering how he survived the fire and I know how, he went into the shack with guns and hid until the fire trucks got there
I always wondered why they never sent in like a Navy Seal team to go in and hunt him down?
I will definitely be seeing this in theaters when it comes out. I very rarely go to the movies and I havent been to one in a year and a half but that film makes me want to go.
this will be a great birthday for me
Looks like to be one of the most goriest movies in the series so far
I can’t fucking wait
In the near future they’ll come up with Michael Myers vs Jason 😆 since they both never run lol
The more suckers buy tickets  the more Universal Pictures transcends
This is how i feel when im playing tombstone myers in dbd
How many times are they gonna make this same movie?, at least be creative, make it different like SAW franchise or Conjuring universe, how many time do they need to "kill" Mikey until they wise up and take his corpse, chop it to pieces, feed it to the pig, butcher the pig, make sausage with the pig, sell it at hotdog stand.
damn Mike won't die he'll survive this one too 😂
Michael really had enough of this towns shit.
Watched his "death" for the first dver time a few days ago, then this comes out... Thanks for waiting for me, Michael.
Halloween: Geriatric  Please, can we put this franchise to sleep.
I really hope I didn’t just watch every kill scene in the movie..
Laurie: “You should be dead” Micheal: “My death was... Greatly exaggerated”
Just take my money
Wouldn't be Halloween without the birthday boy 🎃🎉
A black person dies in this Halloween.
Rob zombies Halloween was the best.
“We need Kong, the world needs him”
LET HIM BUUUUUURN
I grew up enjoying thier movies this franchise and the friday the 13th series i agree im patiently waiting for this release myself
This "We gotta stop Michael" "Evil dies tonight" dialogue is f'n cringe. I'm literally on Michael's side by this point.
If Any fireman is watching this then dang 😭
“EVIL DIES TONIGHT!”
OMG I can't wait 4 this to come out I'ma huge Michael Myers fan I'ma be wearing my mask while watching it!!💯💯🔥
That opening scene with Michael meeting the firefighters head on got me hyped lol. Been watching Michael since halloween resurrection came out in 01’ when I was 7 and over the years I’ve seen every single one so far, and the last one was one of the betters ones so I have hope for this sequel.
I have never been more excited for a horror movie in my life! I can't wait
i thought he was invincible ???
I’m seeing this for Kyle I can’t wait
Trailers show  wayyy to much...
2:20-2:22 i love how she say that
What is going to happen next
So which sequel is this movie adapting from.
thats clever how he escaped
Now they wanna jump this man LOL, the hood woulda been did that
Goddamn.
They've totally killed this franchise  Am I going to c it $$$$
Yes Mikey Back
Michael: “my death was greatly exaggerated”
So exciteddd
See my viral car accident on TikTok at Yfwboy 🥶🥶🥶🥶
Halloween in a nutshell   Michael: I'm dead. I’m alive but I’m dead
Can’t wait
the only person who can kill Michal Myers is Jason Voorhes
This trailer was literally the whole movie
i was named after Michael Myers (my mother told me as a child)  I’ve had a deep obsession w him since, I’m content
Why they just spoil the whole movie 🤦🏽‍♂️
Talk about being your sisters keeper
Looks shit.
To kill micheal your gonna have to shred him into pieces
Laurie: "You should be dead" Michael: "You should know better" Laurie: "Evil dies tonight" Michael(laughing): "C'mon now, like you ain't seen my other movies"!
why is no one talking about the Halloween maskes on the people
Could it be possible for them to make another good Halloween movie?
Halloween, Friday 13th, Nightmare on Elm street.
Michael Myers vs Leatherface
So I think the ppl of Haddonfield are trying to  Laurie to sacrifice her to Michael to get him to leave.
This has to be the 24th installment.
Can't wait no more..🤗🤗 can anybody tell me when it's gonna release.?
Anyone else rooting for Michael in this one ? Goooo Mike !!!
OMFG IM SO HYPED FOR THIS AHHHHHH
bro r u serious
Why don't they just deploy special forces to take him out if the cops are having so much trouble? FFS
まあ、不死身のﾏｲｺｰ兄さんが死ぬわけないですよねー笑笑
‘deedaleeee’   2:11
I feel like we just watched the whole movie in the trailer
THIS SHIT IS GONNA BE FIREEE
So I'm pretty sure that Michael does get arrested at some point in the film and taken to the hospital for his injuries, and that's why we see that Mob & people trying to break into the hospital.
Where is her son at ? She had a son in H2O
Dude this looks fire asf
🎃
I wanna see how Kyle Richards' nose was broken.
Always a good time for a slasher flick. What is it about Michael? Jason and Freddy just played out but Micheal lives on and on and on.
I wonder if michael will fake his own death and frame Laurie for it so he can get her out the way
HYPE
Curtis bad as...
What instrument is used halfway through and till the end of the trailer? Sounds like a cello? Can't be sure, but dying to know
Word on the streetz is that Michael is Busta Rhymes in a William Shatner mask.
What instrument are they using halfway through the trailer till the end? Is it a cello? A violin? Dying to know
We're those masks from Halloween 3?
•_•
https://youtu.be/5bX1FIajfMw
When Laurie screamed "LET HIM BURN", I had goosebumps
Halloween (1978)  Halloween II (1981)  Halloween III: Season of the Wich (1982)  Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988)  Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michiael Myers (1989)  Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers (1995)  Halloween 7: Resurrection (2002)  Halloween 8 (2018)  Halloween 9: Kills (2021)  Halloween 10: Ends (2022)
"It's over. He can't hurt anyone ever again"  The 10-ish firefighter bodies in and outside of your burnt-down house say otherwise.
OOOOhhhhhssshiiiiiieeettttttt!!!
I cant wait
Michael Myers behaves like a cat.
Looks stupid
OMG he know' s how to run
Bro just judging by the trailer this movie might be the most graphic one in the franchise
Will we get to see his boat at long bloody last in this one?
Looking forward for HALLOWEEN 2050 🎃
The Halloween masks from the third movie are a nice Easter egg
They show to much tho
LET it burn, let it burn, the fire dosent bother me anymore
This guy never dies
This looks better than last years CANTWAIT
Can’t wait !! I’m super excited to see how they unmasked him lol
BadAss 🔪
Laurie : evil dies tonight  Michael Myers: you mean knievel bitch cuz I'll b alive tomorrow
Can’t wait 😛❤️👍
Love the fact that the whole town wants smoke with that nigga Micheal😂
Team Micheal
"I belongs to poor family" "I don't have jop and money" "I want to handle my family" "But YouTube is not giving me subscriband view."😭😭🙏🙏 "Ya my condition is worse than other"
imagine living in a town where you think the law enforcement can protect you but then gets slashed by one dude with a knife
I thought the daughter was going to become the new guy, but I guess this guy just won't fucking die :P
Yknow if I was a firefighter and I saw friggin Michael Myers walk out of the house I’d like to think I’d run or hop in one of the trucks and gtfo
im high af
The Rob Zombies ones were hella better.
As stated, it's in this order:  *HALLOWEEN (2018)* --40 year anniversary.  *HALLOWEEN KILLS (2021)* .  And, finally:   *HALLOWEEN ENDS*
Looks like the leaked script was pretty damn close to true!
Only if Donald Pleasence could see the franchise now.  I don’t think he would of ever imagined it would have gone on this long.
They showed every murder and the whole movie. I dont get it.
Halloween  part 45 ..they can drag these films out ..michael myers the only man that walks faster then people run 🏃‍♂️ 🤣🤣🤣
Can Micheal Myers just die. This man has literally survived getting shot out a window. A burning house and whoever knows what else. I know for fact Micheal is tired of staying alive at this point. He literally has the best regeneration factor I’ve ever seen though it’s close to wolverine regeneration factor.
Michael Myers is a undefeated killer from hell.
Finally something to look forward to.
Seeing the main cast screaming at the fire-fighters gave me absolute chills.
Laurie: Evil dies tonight  Michael: 🧍🏼‍♂️🔪
NEW VIDEO OUT NOW https://youtu.be/y9OF2aukuqA 🔥🔥
what is Michael’s motive for killing innocent people?
"You don't know what death is!" - Dr. Loomis
Why can’t they think of something New?
I love the nod to Silver Shamrock masks from Halloween 3 at 1:31
😳😳😳
Yooo!!!
Michael Myers got to use a saw before Jason Vorhees did, so now lets see if he beats the mama's boy body count.
Michael Myers got to use a saw before Jason Vorhees did, so now lets see if The Shape beats the mama's boy body count.
LETS GOOO
So are these movies going with the halloween 6 curse of michael myers story?  satanic ritual superhuman michael myers?
I pray whoever sees this that god blesses you and loves you and your family
No one can kill michael 😈😈
Omg I can't wait
I don’t like how the trailer gives away exactly how Myers survives the fire. I mean that felt like something that should’ve been left up to everyone’s imagination before they actually see the movie. I hate how nowadays these trailers hardly leave anything to be revealed when the film actually hits theatres I’m so sick of it.
Evil dies tonight Money hungry movie producers: allow us to introduce ourselves
I was with you Michael until you started killing firefighters, not cool man...Not cool. 👎
Ah hell yeah the new hunger games movie looking sick
It's going to be a good movie
Why is it so satisfying that they keep referencing all other movies and Halloween 3?
My GOD I thought that was Melissa McBride!
Michael knows not how to chill
This is looking good
1978 Michael Myers: I’ll just hunt down Laurie  2021 Everybody: Michael Myers dies tonight…                  Michael Myers: *Lifts his mask up while turning to the camera breaking the fourth wall* It’s free real estate.👍🏻 *Proceeds to pulls the mask down then KILLS EVERYBODY*
Dat$hitLooksKrazy🤘🏾🕶️🤘🏾💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🍾
I swear they can change the Halloween theme in every new movie
Ohhh, Yeah!!! I Can't Wait To See That!! 🔥🎃🔥
OMG so Classic I love this My child hood memories I’m so glad it’s continued
A GOOD HOPE FOR THE FANS OF THE CLASSIC SLASHERS! LET´S GO MY FAMILYYY
All he needs is the backward Shatner mask...
This movie look hard 🔥
Producers: “Let’s re imagine the other Halloween’s never happened!”  Also Producers: “let’s use all the plots from the other Halloween movies!”
These movies have NEVER been good
Laurie: "Evil dies tonight"  Michael: *stabs the whole neighborhood*
Why they're dragging it?? I'm sure you can get all kind of ammunition in US... How tough is it
hopefully this one isnt as forgettable
That firefighter guy at .34 seconds looks hot ! 🤤😂 even though i can’t see his face
https://youtu.be/xXHm6HUVD9U
another failure of a horror movie. At least do it right, not some bs plot.
Lol "evil dies tonight" when it happens there will be no more sequels to this shitty franchise. Hollywood needs to 🔥 burn
“trailer shows every fucking kill “
"the more he kills, the more he transcends"  Why, that explains EVERYTHING!  Michael is an RPG character with a chaotic evil alignment grinding for that sweet EXP!
The Police also show up to fires
If Jamie “Dies” in the final movie I won’t be surprised.
Franchises need to die at some point and stop milking the past.
When th3 trailer shows the murders and an army Michael: oh boy here I got killing again
"Evil dies tonight" — Michael is like LOL, nope.
REALLY?
fireeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Another one?! My hopes are not high.
Dieser film macht mir Angst
1:33 damn the masks from season of the witch r back hell yeah 😂
Another fuckkkkin movie !!
Love micheal myers
Looks like a great entry in the series, but this trailer gives away too much of the plot and shows too many of the kills.
The trailer just basically showed us the movie😐😐😐
What number is this?
I’m both surprised and grateful that the horror icons haven’t been lumped together like some movie series negative avengers 🤣🤣
I hope this movie going be awesome
0:44: Well, at least he tried to fight back.
Can't wait!!! October go be so lit!!🔥🔥🔥
Well, I don’t need to go see it now, I just saw the entire movie in a 2.5 min recap.
Michael should get his own theme song called I'm Still Stabbing.
Michael always has the GOD MODE cheat activated. I'm not worried for him.
Laurie:  evil dies tonight.   Michael:  hold my beer
There has been so many sequels, Michael Myers wants to die
Laurie: “Evil dies tonight”  Michael: aReEe yOuuU sUrRRe AbOut tHaTtTtT
“What do we do?” “We hunt him down!” Fools, don’t you know what genre you’re in
Dominic Toretto: But nothing beats family.
Ooh oh this is the shit
Michael gotta be 80 years old by now.
this is the dumbest shit but il still watch it
All right I’m back, sorry I was busy burning in a house
Halloween Kills: "Evil dies tonight." Halloween Ends: "We'll this time for real."
Quiet rare how retroactive continuity can save a franchise. It’s never too late to retcon all the rubbish which ruined great franchises.
10 firemen couldn't put down a 65 year oldman with smoke inhalation. Brutal.
The only film I never seem to board ov
Mike is back
This better be good
dam, another one? Count me in.
Rob Zombie take notes. THIS is what your Halloween 2 movie should have been.
Laurie: "Evil dies tonight" Michael: "Been doing this for 40+ 🎃 little girl, betta ask somebody"
Man survived another dousing of being set alight by fire? Jesus at this point just fuckin shove some dynamite up his ass.
Haddonfield fire dept. Hiring
Hopefully this one is actually good and if it isn’t hopefully they have the decency to let him win
Looks like an awesome movie I can't wait to see it.
so like is he supernatural or something? I'm kind of confused.
SHEEEEEEEESH
I forgot Michael has a high threshold of pain (like when he was completely on fire in Halloween 2).
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
please, no more trailers after this. This trailer showed too much already 🤦🏽‍♂️
Really would like to know how his mask did not melt in the fire
I love Halloween movies hope they never stop
I like that it seems like the towns citizens seem like they'll be hunting Michael which is neat
This film Will hope that it maintains The originality,  that it is not immortal
Another one pffff
The beginning of this trailer started off really good, then it was just jumbled by weirdly acted cheesy lines and befuddled with random kill shots. But I'm down to watch some great looking gore.
Despite rejecting the old continuity, these new movies sure know how to cherry-pick. The idea of the first sequel, picking up immediately after the original, directly parallels the first two "Halloween" films in the original timeline, including the image of the hospital. It's also bringing in more heavily the supernatural element, which was the central plot-point for "The Curse of Michael Myers". Overall, though, I'm incredibly excited for this movie. It looks like it's going to be an awesome roller-coaster ride.  (7/4/2021)
No matter how many people Michael has killed, he never can run faster than the cameraman
Man at this point they need to call the nation guard for this man…he came outside & killed the fire squad
Anyone notice that the nurse at 1:27 was the same woman that stared at Michael when he was doing his homicidal walk through houses in the first movie
Again?
He's not that Evil......remember the baby in 2018 he left in the crib. Can't believe I'm still watching Halloween all these years later from 5 years old to almost 37 years old. Still my all time fave!!!!
halloween movie is really cult Michael must die now, on the condition that he never resurrects, let it taste The legend of the movie does not disappear and its value decreases
YESSS FINALLYYYY
I didn’t  know that Kyle Richards from “The real housewives  of Beverly Hills” was an actress too and was also in the Halloween movies.
To me it sounds like they are chanting "we want her", they aren't teaming up against Michael, they want to give him Laurie so he stops killing. Turns this trailer from empowering to terrifying
Sigh... God... A town full of idiots can kill a slow walking freak in a pale mask.
I’m ready
I love this! Hooray!, 45 years this man can’t die!
Ok...All these movies are all the same... Boring! Oh someone is slowly chasing someone else. Boom. Loud noise. Scream. No no no... Some blood. Scary sound effects. Do it do it you bastard. Bad guy suddenly killed. Movie is over. Lot of time and effort spend for the stupid mind... Time to be more creative and less primitive.
i wonder if michael's fingers are still missing from the same night
Classic horror movies are the best, no small talk, he just gets the job done and walks off to find the next victim
Just call the friendly neighbourhood spiderman.
this may be one of the worst trailers i've ever seen. showed the whole damn movie
I hope don't change ending like halloween 2018
Plot twist: when his mask it removed, it’s revealed to actually be Mike Myers from SNL. He is seeking revenge bc Laurie Strode originally pitched him the idea for The Love Guru.
Who would win  Old woman who trained herself to kill for over 40 years  One stabby boy

I wake up every morning and I watch this at least one 😅😅
If you have to reveal this much of a movie, it mustn't be that good.
Laurie vs Michael is the Equivalent to Kevin Owens vs Sami Zayn it's a Fight Forever story!!
You gotta be fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuking kidding me. He’s STILL ALIVE. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
1v1 me killer shack bro, no balls.
That is so stupid...
I think that this movie won't actually show the whole "Town fights Mikey" thing, but Halloween Ends could show that.
trailers so spoilery these days ...
Truth is: She is gonna d-strike him...
They done damn near showed the whole movie, save some for the release date
Not watching the trailer      Definitely watching the movie
Let’s go
Strange how much you can milk out of a old movie. I mean there is still urge for moore of this serie.
You want you're mask? I'm a woke baddie! Come and get it!
0:07 Oh sure cause fire was totally gonna kill Michel Myers anyway. 🙄
🥱 same old shit just another title
I want get exited for this i really do. But i know I’m just going to be let down being its 2021 and every movie sucks now. It’s already got the crappy typical Gen Z trailer and even the theme is redone to make it modern for some reason? Just keep it as it is stop changing shit
I like the Easter eggs from the earlier movies like the Shamrock masks but I don’t like how they show a lot of kills so early in the trailer
I am so hyped for this movie
Laurie “Michael let me talk to you about critical race theory”  Audience “Chants Kill Her!”
Jason voirhees, freddy Kruger, hell raisers, etc wating for their movies to be made: ⏱ 💀💀
They still make these movies lol
Firefighter: Grab my hand  Michael Myers: Come on downnnnn!
interesante
Franchise officially ruined 😡 this looks like garbage
So... A huge fire.... And not a single cop around to put a bullet in Mike Myers? Sure.
does this mean new cosmetics for dbd?
We still on this 😐
Halloween 3: Birth of three Evils  Plot: M.M. was carved in a tree, M.M. was carved in his sister's Heart, in his silence, his mind spoke whispers of transcendence "Kill". Joining the Fray will be non other than Freddy Kruger, the ultimate mashup of Nightmare on Elm Street, and Leather Face for the ultimate Evil vs Evil Turf War.
Micheal is the greatest  serial killer   in the world  long  live Micheal  Myers
Every year innocent pumpkins are killed so a candle can be stuck down their orifice , so their insides can be seen 😱
Laurie “evil dies tonight “ Michael Myers “liked comment”
"LET IT BURN!!!!!!!!" HAHAHAHAHAHA
If I was in a horror movie I would protest like them
Halloween kills AWESOME !!
FFS, just turn one of these into a musical comedy so it can die a dignified death.
Good Lord, that was the whole damn movie right there!
Laurie: HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO TEACH YOU THIS LESSON, OLD MAN!?
BROOO I CANT WAIT
In a society of snowflakes this movie is needed more than ever.
he killed nurse marion chambers
Where is daredevil? Where is the punisher? Where is green arrow?? They should be there fighting myers...
Pov: u are a myers main and u got infinite tear 3 and tombstone
Firemen just trying to do their job. Michael Meyers: "And I took that personally"
Wow looks horrible
Michael Meyers WALKS a 4.2 sec, in a 40 yard dash
Firefighter: pulls out chainsaw  Leatherface: noticed you copied my style
"Let it burn, let it burn, "LET IT SHRIVEL UP AND BURN"
I hope the trailer doesn't spoil too much! *its a fucking kill count*
Next movie. Halloween 1.
I *REALLY* hope this isn't 50% horror 50% action. I want bone chilling Michael.
I am waiting
So awesome to see tommy Doyle in this movie. The little kid from the original.
So what yall want from McDonald's?
This is gonna be a horror classic fasho 😈
I like how he didn't get burned alive
Dont do that, don't give me hope.. 😂😂
He just doesn’t fucking die damn
Damn the whole town fighting micheal is kinda cheating
if he don’t die this movie imma have to step in
xcited
Oh god.. Was the masks a reference to season of the witch? that movie scares the ever living shit out of me
Instead of nameing it Halloween kills it should be called the last Halloween it sounds better  leave a like if you think they should change the title to last Halloween 👍
Ok ok everybody go outside with your guns and wait for the mf already lol
How to kill Michael  Step 1: get a attack helicopter Step 2: fire 10 missiles at every place he may be Step 3: fire miniguns at him Step 4: watch as the little shit dies
Now they all should die...
cant wait
Damn bro ain’t gone never die
Can this series please end already
The only thing that will defeat kitchen knife is *kitchen gun*
Amazing! Hype af!!
Do we even know why he kills??
Everyone Michael dies  Michael nope
Oh yeah. That's Continuity! I Hope they dig deeper into this "Essence of Evil", Angle!!!🔥🔥
Stupid bro
What if Michael fought 20 Navy Seals?
I luv all the little nods to 'Silver Shamrock' in these new flicks...
RIP dead meat when this comes out
Michael Myers's Revenge of fire kills Hacker
Is that Anthony Padilla
I like how the masks from Halloween 3 are in the movie.
Smh I'm 50 and this dude still alive
My favorite horror movies, can’t wait!
Finally!! They filmed this in my home town, Wilmington. NC. Can't wait to see it. ❤
Yyaaaaahhh!!!   Also loved the call backs to the Halloween III masks!
1:32 this might be me, but the masks looks to be a nod to Halloween 3
This trailer is insane
Trailer basically gave away everything
The whole town: Were gonna kill Michael Myers!  Michael Myers: You’re not that guy pal, trust me, you’re not that guy
Whole movie in two minutes. Good to go.
This whole movie is based on a break in firefighting protocol. No need to go into a lost and empty house on fire. Nah! Let’s go in!
Ah shit here we go again
Jeez can’t you come up with any original ideas or maybe a new baddie? I feel like I’m seeing the same baddie do the same stuff in about 4-5 different films…it’s boring and this is the best these big studios can come up with. It’s shameful
They must really be afraid to cut his head off and finish him because they know after that you cant come up with another bullshit way to bring him back. Dudes been shot up..beaten and burned and doesn't even have a limp in his walk. Off with his head
I hope we havent seen All the Kills in the movie  during the trailer...İ confused about  whom Side i am 😂, lorie or Michael ?
Can't wait
As a firefighter I don’t know if I want to see this one .
Micheal vs Jason ? Please
thanks for giving away a bunch of kills -_-
First of all why does it show most of the plot and deaths in this trailer? Second of all, why are they giving Michael these supernatural properties again? Wasn’t the purpose of rebooting the movie from the first film (instead of the second film) to portray the fact he is just an ordinary human? Since there will also be one more Halloween movie, we know he’s going to survive this. Very unfortunate.
what if the next movie will be Michael myers .jr  that would be crazy
Did anyone else catch that the Halloween mask that the dead kids were wearing are from Halloween 3
killing him isn’t gonna work, the entity will revive him…..
I so can’t wait to see this
Damn... the clip where he lifts the firefighter! I remember Holloween 2 (the original) where he kills that nurse with the scapula and lifts her in the air from her back.... that always creeped me out and stood with me as one of the most iconic kills in Fright Slasher films.
Where's Tommy?
Bruh how are people barley finding out about Halloween kills?
Laurie be like: I think I'm missing something? O' what happened to that son of mine? & when did I have a daughter? Michael be like: How does my mask not melt & clothes not catch on 🔥in a🔥🤔🤣
The kills look so brutal in this movie I'm excited!
What if Michael’s suit that he was wearing was fireproof? Maybe that’s why he survived that fire.
this is going to be trash but people still want a good halloween movie and go see it even its trash
I love the fire scene thats my most favorite scene the kills and the scene is my fav from the trailer
killing civilians is okay to me but killing firefighters is a no for me.
This franchise is proof that girls don’t get it done
Me: having such a bad day Michael: I can change that 😏
I feel like universal could have made a beter title for this movie but thats my opion.
Pov youre reading the comments to be les scared
1:53
Seeing how good this movie is going to be i can't imagine how good Halloween ends is going to be
No again nooo
The WHOLE of *Haddonfield Illonois* vs Michael Myers.
I just wanna see an angry mob of micheal's victim's families beat the absolute shit outta him
And why can’t Hollywood make new movies
So what is Michael? He not human?
Hope it’s better than the last turkey.
myths never die
Oh boy this shits gunna rock hard
When he walks out of the house in flames.....ADRENALINE, rushing through my body!
dammmmmmmmm yooooooooooooooooooooooooooo 😨😨😆😆
Respect to the firefighter
Ya naw like he would be able to take on a group of firefighters single handedly there not emts you try and fuck with them they fuck with you
Love that my bday is oct 27...was due on halloween😆love scary/horror movies...best time of the year!!!
To jest kurwa DOBRE 😀Jacek sowa 🇵🇱 to konto mamy
Looks amazing!
It seems all Haddonfield unites against Michael.
The dude still not dead
Very nice. Hopefully a bit better than H2o
I'm so excited for this movie. I'm freaking out!
This is gonna be the best movie of 2021!!!
my brother told me there was a new hallowen movie i thouht he was lying but i sesrched it up my heart stopped
Kinda gay ngl
MICHAEL MY BELOVED
Laurie: “evil dies tonight”  Sequels: “allow us to introduce ourselves”
Who else has seen this trailer like 10 times already!! I know I have!! Man I can't wait!!! 🎃🔪
Hehehe 😂
isnt that enough? just rip his head of at next movie and this shit is done forever
no need to see it now..nearly every kill in the trailer
Why are they releasing it on 10/15 instead of October 13th?  Missed opportunity... SMH
Well guys I have a simple solution to fix this ban all kitchen knifes
This will be so awful, just like all the other prequels to classic movies,  sad 😭😭
I like how in the ending of the previous movie as he’s standing in the basement being engulfed in flames, he was basically like “okay, see you in the next sequel”. Now, here we are
“ he can’t hurt anyone anymore” Micheal Myers: 14 yrs later
Me realizing after all of the Halloween film the whole town decided to fight back: (;´༎ຶٹ༎ຶ`)
Actually I saw every death in the trailer so no need to go to the theater I guess.
Thanks but no thanks. I'll pass on this. Watched the last one and immediately gave it to a friend. Hope y'all enjoy it though.
This better be the last one 😂
Im a fan of the franchise and im glad to know that john carpenter is producing the movie. But this just reminds me of the purge only everyone is after Michael
After a great start, I tink this will be again a great chapter in the new trilogy in the Halloween franchise!
FUCK YEAAAAAA
Oh hell nah
Ah geez. Seriously? Ok. Whatever. Gotta make that money money money.
Looks fcking great!!!
I’m a die hard Myers fan and they just don’t get it man this is not what makes a good Halloween and Laurie should be terrified of Myers not rambo bitch lol

HYPE HYPE HYPE
This one looks so good
This is really disappointing, I was such a big fan of the last Halloween, because it was supposed to put a end to the story (for good). And here they are, cucking it up with another one... 🤦🏾‍♂️
everyone thinks he died till the next moive hes says HELLO HALLOWEEN
"Evil dies tonight"  Michael: "Wait... that's illegal"
Fucking stoked !!
0:43  Fireman: ha ha! I have a saw  Michael: Are you sure about that
Can we let him die this time guys Jesus.
Michael Myers is UNSTOPPABLE ‼️
how does he eat to stay that size?
ngl seems like a chill guy
I can’t tell you how many times I’ve watched this. I’m SO HYPEDD
The Halloween story is so interesting that’s why I like it
Good
You cannot keep a bad man down!! 🎃
I read the leaked script ... they got Loomis in this Film .... How they finna pull that off... knowing The Late Great Donald Pleasence died awhile back??
this is the definition of.....Michael "Call an ambulance, Call an ambulance! but not for me"
Michae is pissed.
Will this ever end lol.
Laurie: “you should be dead!”  michael: “sadly, i died..but then i lived”
Did anyone else notice how they paid homage to Halloween 3 the three masks in the playground where the three masks that you could get in Halloween 3
Are we just gonna ignore that epic cello cover of his theme? It’s too epic to ignore.
Bro wheres the military or sum😂😂
Why wouldn’t Laurie stay to watch him burn?  Why not shoot him while he’s in the basement?  She planned throughly but didn’t plan that out?  This is dumb.  Also the last movie was an excellent ending point and I doubt this will improve the story significantly.
I laughed avery time they say evil dies tonight nope you guys still got one more movie after this one
"Evil dies tonight" Halloween Ends it's just gonna be Laurie watching tv, listening to a top 40 station and cleaning the oven
Laurie: Myers is dead he can’t hurt anyone else no Myers:continues to ruthlessly murder people
Cant Wait to see this😉
Laurie: evil dies tonight Michael: who’s evil? I’m Michael.
It’s too bad the acting seems sub par.
They won’t kill him, they’ve been trying to do so for the last 40 years 🤣
Sweet!
2:19 “u want ur mask.. COME AND GET IT!!!” God damn this is gonna b so good
1:31 “if u track Michael’s victims it’s a straight line to Micheal’s childhood home” damn that’s chilling
laurie- evil dies tonight   the halloween movies having 11 films and theres going to be a 12th one soooooooo i smell cap
There’s at least 43 kills in this trailer.  Imagine how many will be in the movie
Michael gets COVID at the end
I read that they filmed another sequel 2 years ago
Adamantium mask, check. Self cleaning knife, check. Portal gun, check.
This is gonna be amazing
Oooh Andi Matichak’s screaming “Do it” gave me chills
I feel bad for the firemen they whare just trying to do thare job
This sent chills down my spine  This is some next level shit!
Laurie:"EVIL DIES TONIGHT"  Me: Checks calender Halloween 2021,2022,2023,2024,2025.....💀
Can't wait to pirate this. 😝
The way Michael, a 60-or-so year old man, lifts up a 170 pound man like he's superhuman.
“Evil dies tonight.” No one told you…Evil can’t die. Bring on the more Halloween movies
this movie is such a parody
first and the second was awesome and Michael Myers died at the end, that's it, end of story, ALL the next movies are $hit and stupid.. an invincible moron with a mask kills everyone.. what a good movie ! ..LOL @ Universal Studio halloween 25!, you're morons, please get a life..
The lady with the green mask on is nurse marian chanbers
We all know that under mask he wears another
Anyone else notice the Silver Shamrock Masks in this trailer?
Upon further rewatching I Listened carefully and I heard the mob chanting something over and over again the best I could come up with is “We will not stop” but it’s not the easiest thing to hear. What do you guys theorise they are saying? LISTEN CAREFULLY
Looks exactly like all the others. A crew of firefighters could have definitely taken one dude out. This is dumb. Jamie Lee Curtis’s hair looks so damn fake. Another pass.
Love it.
The Halloween 3 mask’s 🔥🔥🔥🔥
"Evil dies tonight."  No. Mike Myers will never really be defeated, because he's the only horror villain people still like, so they're never going to stop making Halloween movies, and people will keep watching them, because most horror fans will watch literally anything and everything horror-related.
Listen I’m tired of this whole Halloween thing, go awayyyy 😂😂😂
Oh my god by the looks of it, Allison's boyfriend dies 😮
2.7k dislikes wow what garbage am I going to watch
"Laurie strode :" evil dies tonight  " Michael myers " I'm immortal, thought you'd have gathered that by now ...
Awesome,  can't wait to see this , looks absolutely brilliant , Jamie Lee and James jude courtney 💯💯❤
I just realized the body wearing  the witch mask has the same clothes as marion chambers in the trailer so our favorite chain smoking nurse is probably gonna die
they shot him off a deck in the first movie and they're still trying to kill him with bats and knives, like if he took a bullet to the chest and walked off then i doubt a bat will do to much
Anyone else remember when Machete Kills was gonna get a sequel called Machete Kills…In Space! They really should do that with this 😂
I stopped watching the trailer at 1:07 Don’t want to see anymore until it comes out! Can’t wait!
Why did Michael Myers turn into a badass when Halloween is a horror movie?
can we just stop it....please?
I like what I see but the trailer makes it look like an action film instead of a horror film
I feel like they have all the good parts away
https://youtu.be/-VY4glqA6Bo
Can’t read comment sections at all anymore without every single one being the same meme format
Just send in the national guard the FBI and the navy seal for Christ sake this guy has killed like 70 people just in the trailer this should be some kind of national emergency
I like the Halloween 3 reference
His looks fire bro
I lowkey want Michael to win in the end, not just a ‘everyone thinking he’s dead but apparently he’s not’ kinda ting but a genuine he slaughters the entire town and nothing anyone does is enough against him victory would be nice
Laurie: Evil dies tonight Michael: Yeah right, in your dreams
Can't wait for this film coming in October it looks very good
I like that they kept that thing when Laurie is in hospital just like the second original movie, cant wait to see it!
Im fucking pumped
Did I just watch the whole movie?  It feels like I watched the whole movie 🤔
Exept the one who fall
Those poor fireman 😔😔😔
I can’t wait for this movie to come out, I’m so excited!
Evil dies tonight 🤔
Please. Michael Myers cannot be killed. He is as deathless as Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger. Myers transcended the moment he picked up the knife and donned the mask.
i dont think ive ever been so hyped for a horror film before
I can’t wait
Halloween kills kill count 2 firefighters 6 firefighters  Old gentleman  Old gentlewoman 3 trick or treaters A woman and a men
holy shit universal this looks like a sick birthday present. thanks!
Laurie: Evil dies tonight  Micheal: you sure about that?
how did he survive without a scratch?
OMGGGGG IM SO EXCITED
Halloween HYPE
Terrible
Image William Shatner turns out to be a serial killer
Yay! I really liked the last, it was a return to form. If this is half as good, I will be happy :)
iv'e got literal goosebumps
The hunter becomes hunted
Damn... you know they're running out of ideas for the franchise when they reference Halloween 3 in the trailer!
boring...
It looks a lot more gory than the last one 😬
Spooky dooky 👻💩
Halloween 6 last ride along
So Michael is immortal
*I had to STOP the trailer, not to spoil the movie.....DAMN!!! STOP GIVING AWAY THE WHOLE MOVIE IN THE TRAILER!!!*  I basically saw Michael kill the firefighters to leave the house, kill the guy outside the house (which I am sure was supposed to be a suspenseful moment), the whole movie is being given away!!!!!! *SMMFH*
Every night, Michael Myers check for John Wick under his bed before going to sleep
I feel like the kill count on this movie is going to be high just by the trailer alone
I can tell already this is gonna suck. Thanks for giving the whole movie away in the trailer.
0:18 that poor firefighter.
This movie is just going to piss me off. You have a gun... why are you getting closer to him... so many of them have guns and they're just walking up to him...  This movie looks like it'll be fun af and maybe put a bit of action in an otherwise stale movie design, but it's still got that classic Slasher trope: Dumbass victims.
FUUUUUUUUUCK YESSSSS!!!!!!
That's tuff because of the firefighters That's was killed That's tuff ripped
Ok it looks cool but was it really necessary to show like 80% of the kills in the trailer
T
That's sad because  of the firefighters that was killed That's tuff
Ah yes, this is what the world needs more of lol.
I'm back.
I seriously doubt that the trailer would show ALL of the kills in this movie but daaammmmnnnnnn that’s a lotta bodies
Fuck this if he is human he would've die already bs
I'd like the reboot series more if they included the second movie when he went after her in the hospital, then she'd have a bigger reason to prepare for WW3 against evil. One night he kills 3 people and he's Charles Manson?
Entire town starts hunting Michael  Michael: is that all you got?
Damn if only Donald Pleasence was still living to be apart of this reboot
The flames couldn’t cleanse the evil that is Myers Hell itself didn’t want the killer that never tires Those firemen only wanted to stop the fires One by one the town will know the wrath of Myers  Myers my boy on another killing spree
Michael Myers about to go John wick on this town
This just shows all the kills. Stupid trailer.
I love how the people of Haddenfield r also taking part in hunting Michael down and bringing him to justice
Really taking queues ftom the otiginal second halloween
Laurie: Evil dies tonight. Michael: Oh no!... Anyway.
This lowkey was the most exciting trailer I’ve seen in years.
Love how all those firemen justed watched their friends dying 1 by 1 and didn't try to flee or call for help lol
This trailer just showed like all the kills in the movie
Halloween Kills Feat Season of the Witch Mask Trio "Happy Happy Halloween Halloween Halloween..."
Thanks for showing almost all the kills in trailer. Definitely doesn't detract from the actual movie or anything
The way he kills those firemen....alarms me
Of course they used Biden woth editing
It’s happening………………
Hype but they kinda showed too much
So much murder in this trailer.
I feel I already watched the movie, too much spoiler
This looks goooooooooooooooooooooooddddddddddddddddddddddd
Anyone notice the kid's masks? Halloween III Season of The Witch.
This is probably the only movie in history where I've seen the whole movie in the trailer.... AND I STILL WANNA SEE THE COMPLETE MOVIE!
They just get more stupid, first Halloween is the best.
the lady that talked to dr loomis about laurie being michael sister will die cause it shows her body dead with the witch mask and later on the trailer shows her same but alive and being attacked by michael
I wish I had 1% of MM's determination...
Pov: year is 2056  Halloween:sheesh edition
Soooooo, what the fuck happened to her son from back in the day
Looks absolutely awful
With all those kills he def has all the specialist perks
NO FLIPPING WA
dont you love 6’5 firefighters being killed by this 40 year old dude with a plastic mask
I’m pretty sure Michael will never die like the people from Fast and Furious
Everyone: “He died in the fire.”  Michael: “uh, debatable?”
it takes place on november 1st thats false advertising
Gonna be that guy. Not a fan of it. Looks ridiculous.   This is the same night of the previous film, right? You expect me to believe that all this goes down: trick or treating, the murders, the Strode fight, going to the hospital, fire department showing up, more murders, rioting in the streets for some reason (no wait, I know the reason. Unneeded, out of place symbolism of the 2020 riots) and a final showdown…all in one night.  This is too chaotic for a Halloween movie imo. Too much going on. The original Halloween 2 played things similarly, but not to a crazy degree like this.   Of course it could be better once we’ve watched it, but from where it’s standing now, I’m not impressed.
I can’t sait to see it! I hope they don’t fuck it up somehow although I doubt it!
SEASON OF THE WITCH!!!!!!!
michael jason there will be another.....
Halloween 27 Michael has twin boys and goes to Disneyland....take my 💰 I will watch
Sequel to Halloween 2018?
WE REALLY NEED A MM VS JASON MOVIE!!!!
Wtf
All you gotta do is run him over with a tank, 😂😂
Wow epic music for this fantastic trailer and I’m so hyped for it too.
If anyone was paying attention, you could hear Michael breathing after the credits in Halloween 2018. So this isn’t a surprise film
Laurie: Evil dies tonight.  Michael: Am I a joke to you?
Wow. I really felt like just watched the entire movie...can we please go back to being vague?
The shape buff when this releases?
How many times will y’all revamp and remake movies. Jeeee like can y’all not come up with new ideas? We get it he NEVER DIES wow we scary. I love classic horror movies and the thrillers but give us something new something fresh like horror movies this year have not been scary nor fun to watch. Give me something like the strangers the first movie it was soooooo goood and more realistic since everyone died but that was amazingggg
This is looking good
he hid inside the gun locker in the bunker and that how he survived i think
fuck, he looks mad
Oml it's like I want him to die but I want more
Jamie Lee Curtis Is Proably Starting To Notice That Like Her Mother Janet Leigh. Hollywood Looks At Her As Just A Washed-Up Has-Been Actress.  So Now She Takes Any Gig That She Can Get. Like Mother Like Daughter. Why Dont' She Just Call It A Day? Is Retirement That  Terrible Of A Thought?  Her Mother Probably Wished That She Did Retire Herself,
They say saying he’s gonna die “tonight”🤣
Omg they brought back the season of the witches mask
this shit is way overplayed now bro
Ah yes. *Halloween 10.*
1:32 Wow. Halloween 3 universe nod. 👌
1:28 its a little too late for that, he killed like a fire crew of 8 people and 2 whole families
He may be a devil but that mask is latex and fake hair NO WAY that mask makes it out the fire!
this, this is very pog
Michal came out that fire that like krombopulos michael. Here I go killing again
he been trying to Kill that woman for 80yrs but he keeps killing everybody but her.. Damn it's getting Old!
He’s never gonna die is he
I have a feeling that guy who hits that car with the bat. Has Micheal in it, like in Halloween 5 where he rolls around in that muscle car. Would be interesting to see what he does with it. Maybe running them down like he did to Jamie Lloyd.
This is the first time the victims fight back lol
It’s gotta be canon that springtrap and Michael are related. They both survived fires
Glad they're touching more on the fact he's technically "not human" hes the shape. Evil itself taking a form. If you look as well, and around 2:10 His fingers he lost in the previous movie are still missing, He can't heal. Hes the Shape.  Michael Myers who was the human basically is taken by Evil itself and becomes his body. Kind of like a husk
All the fucking movie spoiled!!!!
They are never gonna let this franchise end huh? Im not against it. But this seems to be drawn out more than Fast and Furious .
So after seeing this and breaking it down I think I get what is going on with Jaime Lee (Lori Stroud) in this one! Again just a theory but looks like its pointing to the possibility.  So upon arrival finding out Michael is still alive Lori goes into a craz panic and attempts to leave the hospital! However the doctors lock her in a hospital room do to her condition and thinking she is loosing her mind because of all that has happened. However as things escalate and all these bodies start arriving to the hospital Morgue by the end the town knows Lori Stroud is the only one with the experience to kill this "Evil" (trailer shows the clip of people attempting to break down a hospital door.) The town helps Lori come out of the hospital because they need her help. Which is why in the end you see Lori walking down the hall free with a knife and no nurses caring any more do to the overwhelming amount of dead that are coming out. Also the dead person in the Witch Mask (Silver Shamrock H3 easter egg) is the Nurse from H2. The Burgundy sweater and the same shirt just covered in blood.
nil this already spoiled the movie
Michael gets pallets dropped on him repeatedly every day. Like a little fire will hurt him
Just use pallets and do the gens, ez win.
Is this movie coming out this year?
Laurie: Evil dies tonight. Michael: The lie detector determined... That was a lie!
Lol he just keeps coming back...what about H20?? When she cut his head off?? Lol
The masks from Halloween 3. Adorable.
I’m still mad that this man is 6’8 and decided to kill people. Man’s could’ve been balling.
Does this mean more Dead By Daylight cosmetics??
Was I the only one who had a problem with how Laurie Strode was written as a doomsday prepper who only armed herself with revolvers and lever action rifles? Any gun nut has an AR-15 chambered in .300 Blackout with a .45 cal sidearm loaded with hollow points ready to go at a moment's notice. Would have made the reboot a much shorter movie.
.
R.I.P TO THE FIREFIGHTERS
Jamie Lee Curtis know damn well it's not over..... They beefing 4EVA
Correct me if I’m wrong but all he wants to do is kill his sister right?
I don't really want the franchise to ever end, but when is someone going to finally bust out an MP-5, Grenade Launcher or Flamethrower and stop coming at this immortal killing machine with a damn Dollar General steak knife???? 🤷🏻‍♂️
Dang Yo 🤯 the first 30 second's are wickedly rough💯 Michaels back😱
Cgi blood? Really?
Gotta love the shamrock mask easter egg
The song at the beginning gives me Jurassic world fallen kingdom vibes
I showed my mom this and she said ‘HIM AGAIN?!’
Mikey: "Mmm, dead,... Uh no ppl still pay 2 watch me stab and slay, sorry"
Karen: LET IT BURN    Micheal: What are you doing?
They just basically showed the whole movie
Laurie- “Evil dies tonight” **Michael “dies”**  Michael- SIKE I LIED
Did you catch the Halloween 3 reference with the 3 masks? The witch the pumpkin and skull. Dope
Kinda don’t like how much they show, and how they show most kills.
the sequel will always be more interesting then the beginning.
Ya can't kill the Boogeyman!
nah they revealed too much with this trailer
If they are going to go with something supernatural I hope they keep it vague. The fear of a killer like Michael comes from how little we know of his motivation. Too much explanation will just make it less scary. We've already seen that with the old sequels.
Lets be real No one wants Michael to die lol
Laurie "Evil dies tonight" Movie Production "kinda"
*You hear faintly* “Welcome to the Kill Count, where we tally up the victims in all our favorite horror movies.”
They could've easily killed him in the last movie but they will fail again this movie
I like how they have the dead people on the spinny thing (idk) with a punkin on there heads oland a skeleton as a call back to Halloween 3 I think
Laurie: “Evil dies tonight.” Michael: LAUGHS IN HALLOWEEN ENDS
It's just keeps getting worse and worse smh
He is ageing though. Eventually he'll need an electric scooter thingy. Luckily they aren't very fast.
Michael Myers is basically a roadman
Laurie: "Evil dies tonight"  Micheal: "I'm not the one that dies, kid. I'm the one that does the killing"
I think I pooped whe I saw Michael with a freaking saw🤭😳😦
Poor firemen they just wanted to help :(
Laurie:Evil dies tonight... Micheal:Ooh OoH ScARy!
I’ve seen all of the Halloween movies I can remember the mother and daughter and the girl trapping him and setting him on fire and he still comes back I am so excited words can’t even explain I am a big Michael Myers fan but I hope they can finally kill him I know it can’t be done but we will see😁
Fun little Easter egg: the masks shown on the three victims in one of the shots is the masks seen from Halloween 3: Season of the Witch!
,
Halloween 3 masks. Nice reference.
Halloween's good again yay
👏👏👏😝😝😝
Universal doesn't seem to understand what a "dead horse" is.
so Michael Myers turned into batman? Remember when he used to lurk in shadows for kills? He’s taking on groups of people now lmao.
Just saw the whole movie in 5 minutes lol
3 more months Untill............ Halloween
I don't want it to end.
At 1:35 is that Michael in the background yes or no
By my calculations Michael myers still has 19 or 20 lives left.  he used the Konami code.
Looks well shit
Nice video cool movie 🎥
Epic!
*     This is basically a remake of the original Halloween 2. Why did they need to do a remake of it. I mean, it's basically the same thing. Why was there all this hype that the original Halloween 2 sucked, but this doesn't. You've got a 62 year old Laurie Strode talkin' about "I'm coming for you Michael" with just a butcher knife, trying to act all bad-ass an shit. I mean....give me a fucking break. At this rate, I think I still like the original Halloween 2 better than this. I'm sorry but.......this is just a huge disappointment. I'll go see it but..........I don't know.
Bruh those firefighters weren’t ready for that shit. This has me so HYPE LETS GOOO
Can we all accept the fact the Mike Myers is invincible? And yes, both the serial killer AND the Canadian.
This guy has more lives than a cat.
So relaxing
One thing i would love they do is to keep the original music as it is, no remix or newage bs. The original music/s are scary and gives u chills and keeps ur butt tight on the seat while u watch the movie.
Well that just made my week!!! I just had no idea they were going to give me my “fix” and make another Halloween by the likes of John Carpenter no less!!!!????? I’m a freak for the franchise for FORTY YEARS it’s been a rewarding part of my existence;-)
Also anyone notice the silver shamrock ?
Every horror film released since 2010 has been just absolute horse shit
Please stop remaking good franchises and making them absolute horse shit
So who tf are we gonna see Michael kill in the movie Lol
Nice little reference to Halloween 3
i love how everyone thinks michael survived the fire via supernatural means when you can literally see him in the closet where the guns were hidden in Halloween (2018) meaning that closet is not only fireproof but that Michael had enough brains to hide in there and not burn
Michael gone outlive all of our asses 🤣🤣🤣
Gangsta ass trailer but they showed too much of Michael's awesome killings. This trailer making him look like Jason Voorhees with the brutal slayings. Love it
This looks good.
Three different masks, a skull, pumpkin, and witch, now that is a reference to Halloween 3 season of the witch.
“I prayed that he would burn in hell. But in my heart, I knew that hell would not have him.”  Dr Samuel Loomis.
Yeah this is going to be great
I’m definitely watching
William Afton 🤝 Michael Myers  *Always coming back.*
Jamie Lee Myers
They came in deep just to kill one person😭😭
I can’t wait to watch kill count!
So this the new Halloween movie
MM vs BLM protestors ? tempting ... but nah I'll pass. Blumhouse is shit. anyway I feel like I watched the whole movie already with this stupid trailer.
awesome seeing Jamie Lee Curtis back!!!!! yippee!!!
Michael Myers is literally the Devil in the flesh
Slightly more excited about the With Gourley and Rust episode about this movie than the movie itself.
I’m dying to see this 😱😱😱😱
One vet with an AR and this movie is over. Instead they use a pump action shotgun and some kitchen knives😂😂
He is the reincarnation of evil it’s self
Michael myers is back. And this time, he knows how to gps track your smartphone
Firefighter: *tries to take a chainsaw to Michael's face* It's gonna me MAEH-   Michael- oh I really wish it was- I *really* wish it was you, pal-  *But it's not.*
who called the fire  brigade then ?
That is one sturdily made mask.
Michael is Diarrhea and Haddonfield is tired of this shit...
I heard this one was going to show more blood and kills on screen and it would be far more brutal than Halloween 2018. That's why it's called halloween KILLS. 🔪
Halloween kills is such a dumb name tho lol
That firefighter was not that guy pal
"Halloween Ends" has to finish with Michael Meyers and Laurie Strode killing each other, similar to Hannibal and Will Graham falling off the cliff together in "Hannibal".
I love halloween
Why make a horror movie trailer in the format of an action movie trailer.
Michael in that custom game. Man taking on the whole lobby
Daddy chill, I thought you were dead😩
R.i.p to all the essential workers of Haddonfield
Let’s go Halloween 3 reference!!!!!!
I'm never gettin bored of Halloween movies, after so many years.. xD
Already know it will be better than zombies versions 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hey well at least it's not Jason Voorhees, I don't know how long they would last if it was...
Idk Laurie might die in this ..not sure guessing
The Halloween theme done by violin is sooooo good!!!!
At first I wasn't very thrilled with the idea of a sequel, as I really liked how the previous movie ended. But this looks nice ! Hope it's going to be a worthy addition to the "reboot/restart" story line
Michael: What the Fuck, Covid is everywhere, No ones isolating, And I'm the only one in this town wearing a mask.  Michael: (Pauses)   Michael: Right time Enforce Covid Measures and Slaughter an entire Town
Its pretty Obvious this will be the best Halloween since The second Original.🔪🔪🎃
Remakes… are never good
The violin works so well with the theme
Beating a dead horse. You can't just throw money at the people behind the original and expect the same result. Then again this movie isn't about making something with integrity, it's about milking the nostalgia reboot donkey and we're all suckling at the tit.
OCTOBER 15TH I CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG BRO
It looks cool but it’s creepy so much blood and kills this time wow
Firefighters come and saves Michael Myers from house fire :  **Michael kills his saviors**  Michael Myers : *My goals are beyond your understanding*
Its good to see a season of the witch reference with the masks
Michael Myers? Never heard of her.
Bad ending please! BAD ENDING PLEASE!
How many times does Laurie have to say, “I’m coming for you, Michael “ lol it never fails in every movie
there will be another halloween. it will be called Halloween Ends. evil won’t die anytime soon
‘Evil dies tonight’  Me: you’ve been saying that for the past 40 years!
Looks like the script leak was pretty accurate.
"If you track Michael's victims, that's a straight line to Michael's childhood home."  Nice touch that those victims were all wearing Silver Shamrock masks. (Or, at least, they looked like them)
Jamie Lee: he is flesh and blood Military: say no more fam Military: 2 min later, um that was easy.
Can't be that evil he let the baby live in the last movie
Boring 🥱
Hope Michael kills the franchise in this one.
Ой мазафакаааа, обожаю этот фильм! Жду!
you should of killed me when you had the chance- myers
Love the trailer but they really named the Halloween kill wdym ofc he kills people but no hate tho Iam going to watch the movie because I enjoy scary movies
I _just_ saw this trailer advertised, and I immediately came here to see it again. This is already awesome enough to re-watch!! The way Laurie screams "LET IT BUURN!" keeps me coming back!!!
Can’t wait for the everything wrong with Halloween kills. “A man couldn’t survive a fire” well Laurie he hid in your gun cabinet and waited for help
Another movie ruined by bad acting
I have the script and it's AMAZING. Its just straight up madness.  If there's a parallel it would be Empire Strikes Back. Evil is heavily tilting the scales in its favor.   Anyone wants the .pdf ; reply to this and we will see how I can send it.
Laurie : evil dies tonight   Micheal : oh , yeah I also killed the producers of the movie too
Best ever Halloween day my birthday
Guy:*pulls out chain-saw*  Micheal:*Uno reverse*
OMFG IM SO EXCITED
🇫🇷🇫🇷
He’s quasi-evil. He’s the margarine of evil. He’s the Diet Coke of evil, just one calorie, not evil enough.
They should have Michael in the Dark Universe
This kinda ruins the last movie which retconned all the other sequels. Where Michael is just a crazy guy who embodied evil, here they are going back to him being the devil
I dont get it. I gotta watch the movie again. But, I could've sworn Michael escaped from the house while it was on fire. And I think the house crumbled down as well. Now your telling me he got out cause of firemen making a huge mistake??? Never the less still good and I cant wait to see it.
Is it just me, or is the Halloween series becoming as repetitive as the SAW series?
YESSUH GRANNY GON TAKE MICHAEL DOWN ONCE AND FOR ALL LESSGO GRANDMA😤😤🥱🥱😈😈
They showed too much
She said Michael Myers Is Flesh And Blood That's Right But   He Is A Unstoppable Monster That Could Survive Anything
I just watched the whole movie and saved money
Laurie: evil dies tonight  Michael: yawns 🥱 not this night  Freaking exciting!!!!!!
Geezzz why don't they learn that his weakness is WATER !!! ISE BLASTOISE !!!
The first haloween movie:  im going to kill micheal myers  10 movies later: im going to kill micheal Myers
Fire man: *pulls out chainsaw*  Micheal Myers: We don’t do that here
"evil dies tonight" how many times did I heard that 😅😂
will he just die already
How’s this guy still alive is the question
I'm intrigued and wanna see the movie but why did the Black woman seem to get the most gruesome death in the trailer? Anybody else peep that?
I hope this is a box office hit.
Not sure how he returns after he got his head cut off a number of years ago.  And what's up with the hatred for the sister.  Dude holds a grudge.
bruh this has become the fast and furious of slasher movies
Is this a Rob Zombie one ?
She cut his head off in H20...he's been dead! Stop making more Halloween movies! 🤦
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Michael uses chainsaw  Leatherface: your not that guy pal...your not that guy
He's even killing middle aged black ladies now. Michael must be stopped!
Well thanks for playing whole movie pretty much. Now I don’t have to go pay $10 to see it 👌
we need a nightmare on elm street movie all ready that 2010 one sucked
Michael myers needs some sex..  he'll chill out after that..  dude been super angry for over 30 years..
This looks great. Can’t wait!
Oh shit she took his mask off
i always wondered as well that why cant he be killed ? They shot him with like a m16 and he just ate the whole clip and raised up.
Whewwwwww! I’m ready are y’all? Lmao this looks crazy
why did this got me hyped so much?!
Obviously he don't die like the terminator,  how else would they make more shyte movies
Boring, how many times can a human watch stabbing movies before they think , hmm now what will happen next
I feel like I've seen the whole movie.
This actually looks sick
What do we do?   Laurie: We fight!  Captain America: Hey! that's my line!  Laurie: No shit
Need guitar version of this trailer :(
I just love how those firefighters just stood there...instead of jumping in thier trucks and driving away. 😑
who would've known a simple kitchen knife would do this much damage
ahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
this looks like crap
This a new concept for the Halloween franchise, having the entire neighborhood actually go after Michael Myers, can’t wait to watch this one
Thanks for the free movie 🍿 enjoyed it 😭 that’s why I don’t like to watch trailers😂
That trailer pretty much told the whole movie!
I WANT TO SEE IT SO BADLY
IM SO EXITED FOR THIS
One and only my fav horor thriller.... I don't know why I addicted Michael Myers..
Love the cello in the theme,    You guys really outdid yourselves with the pacing of this trailer.  Which I could have worked on the set but I was in Savannah with Sony at the time,    Totally going to see this in the spooky AMC theater here in town.
At the 1:34 mark, that must be a homage to the absolutely terrible film, 'Halloween 3: Season Of The Witch'.
The classic melody with the violin kills it!
Holy shit dude.... lets fuckin go.
Evil dies tonight...  ...but not in this movie, in the next one.
Michael Myers emerges from the flames of hell on a whole new level. The more Laurie escapes the more michael increases the kill rate 🔪 🩸🎃 .
It was never over.   We all knew that.   It was only a matter of time.   Michael will kill again.   To satiate his endless bloodlust.
Pretty good film.  Thanks for letting me watch it for free.
Best horror music score ever.  Always was and will be.
Can't remember seeing a trailer for an horror movie that actually looked amazing. Ghost and demon horrors bore me. But a psycho in a mask to me is terrifying. I am loving The way the town people are hunting him and he just keeps counter attacking lol. Myers  just gives me chills.
I swear, the feelings i have for this movie,no horror movie is like Halloween. I think Halloween is the blueprint of all serial killers out there, Michael is one hell of a killer! You can't get bored watching this movie,the aesthetic the vibe, i think, no one should celebrate Halloween without watching this movie with their family/friends.
Laurie: "Evil dies tonight" Michael: Send's Jason Voorhees a text message ''Bruh this bitch is crazy''
What a terrible name for this
Sony :- don't breathe 2 Universal pictures:- Halloween kills
October? 왓 더. ...I can't wait
Jamie lee Curtis ruins it for me. She’s too old for her part
This muffugga NEVER dies!
anouther cash grab just b4 halloween lol, go figure
Can someone please tell me what the hell the people are chanting?
The Halloween III masks!!!
Why are they showing us soo much in the trailer??? Showing us everyones death scenes. They look amazing but goodness I wanna wait until the movie to see it
"Evil dies tonight"   Everyone else dies, they must be evil lol.
I knew he pulled him up! 😩
Laurie: evil dies tonight   Micheal: you do know I'm gonna get another movie right?
My only worry is Michael ending up like the predator, where in the first predator, those soldiers actually had a chance at killing it, and it had to be smart picking them off one by one, cut forward to the recent predators where its pretty much bullet proof, i hope Michael keeps that "human" feel to him and not this unstoppable force (worry was mostly sparked by him taking out that whole group of fire fighters)
Michael, don't kill the firemen! They're here to put the fire out.
Yeah 3 entlted women will surely kill Michael Meyers..  BULLSHITT..  feminisme lies to itself almost as much as religion does
bruh can we kill the series at this point
These movies aren't good for you.
My twitch channel consept.
wait wait wait is this The New movie?
They finally showed his face even tho it’s James playing Michael or someone else
Ok y’all just gotta accept death at this point cause there ain’t no point trying to kill this dude no more💀my mans is invincible
Okay anyone else think they should call the SWAT team or national guard at this point? They would secure the entire town, deploy K-9 units and shoot his ass in a second. ….Over
Doesn't the firefighters gear add about another 100 pounds to them? Jesus..
Love firefighters and everything they do, but seeing Michael fucking slaughter them has me so excited
Bruh this movie looks and sounds good but if someone don’t just bring an AR and call it a day  😭
The one before this... I really didn’t like. But this could be good, who knows! Can’t help myself but to go see it anyway ;)
Laurie-“Evil Dies Tonight”  Michael-“Anyway I started stabbing”
Theye really need a new villain
Michael been after her for over 40 years 😂
Thanks for showing like 90% of the fucking movie. wtf.
It’s lit
This trailer shows way too much.
Hört der scheiß niemals auf?
I guess they're gonna keep milking this franchise till it becomes powered milk.
As they say: no matter how fast you run, Michael Myers walks faster
0:41  Me: HE GOT THE CAMERA MAN TOO?!?💀
*THE CASUAL GIRLS ARE* MIAKHALIFA.UNO    Youtube: This is fine Someone: Says ''heck'' youtube: be gone однако я люблю таких рыбаков ..
I’m watching this with my dad let’s goooo best Halloween movies ever made micheal Myers
Just when I think they can’t get any better then Boom. I just love Michael Myers sequels. Wow this one looks real good. Whoever  the Director is this guy is brilliant. Simply amazing. Can’t wait to see it
EVIL DIES TONIGHT Michael Myers: AH HAHA BUT ANYWHO
I like the little nod to Halloween 3 in this trailer, but these new Halloweens with their feminist bullshit overtones and predictable Mary Sue characters are tiresome, so I doubt I'm gonna pay to sit through this. Love the originals - I'll stick with that!
Laurie: 'Thank God Michael is finally dead" Cop: "He's still alive" Laurie: "Ah shit, here we go again"
I remember watching halloween like 2 or 3 years ago wow
The trailer gives too much away
Ayo There’s a Another Michael Myers movie coming up in 2022 is Halloween ends?!???
These movie titles are getting more absurd by the year. Is “not sounding natural or catchy” the trend now for titling things now?
These movies are the reason society is f ucked up
Feels like I Just watched the whole movie
Lol the series is overdone
Evil doesn't die tonight because there's at least one more movie in this franchise.
Michael Myers
This is nice but We all know we want another Rob zombie it would be amazing
is this a prequel? couldnt sworn he was locked up in a daylight courtyard or something in the last movie
Well we know the man for the kill count which seems like it’s gonna be alot
YASS MY SIS MICHAEL IS BACK
Spoilers 🤦🏻‍♂️
Laurie: "evil dies tonight"  Michael: "so i just punched thru the window and smashed his head into the wall, then stabbed an old lady with a long lightbulb"
The trailer had more death scenes than most horror movies 🍿 🎥
What do suppose will happen if everyone came at Michael with weapons, dismembered him into pieces then bury them in different places? 🤔 I mean there has to be a way to kill him. I get that he is powerful and possibly immortal but how immortal can he be if he ages? If he has all that evil then there must be a good to his bad to destroy him, otherwise the universal balance would be off.
I feel like Laurie and Michael are both gonna die
dude must hate death at this point
Michael vs  bomber man xD
Michael never die 🤔
I'm confused, is this the 6th or the 7th Hallowen ?
Laurie: He can't hurt anyone anymore  Michael: **kills fireman** Are you sure about that?
Michael is immortal, bullets fly by him!
Laurie: Throws Michael in housefire  Michael: Yes, very sad. Anyway...
Luv all these movies bt wht hapn to Laurie's  grandson frm her daughtr Jaime and also laurie's son....still my all time favs
When the movie is out and over with cant wait to see dead meat kill count this if he does
Austin powers- why wont you die! 😂😂
Is it me or it seems more gore and violent than the other Halloween movie series?
Love the Halloween 3 mask reference on the victims
The last good Halloween movie was made in 2007. Everything that followed is 💩.
The fact thst he's still alive after all of that is crazy
AHHHH YESS
One of my favorite mask murderer. After is Jason Voohees. This right here is classic.
why so unrealistic/superhuman? pointless.
the number of times they say michael myers is alive
Making Halloween movies i see ... Still haven't catched up to VOORHEES KILLS!! pretty sure Jason's next movie gonna rack 60 kills. Jason needs to one punch Michelle Myers head off. Isn't Michelle Myers pedifile. Halloween 4 n 5 going after a child.
Interesting concept of having a whole town hunt him down. Should be interesting to see. Looks really good!
order pure mdma #3mmc##flualprazolam#5-meo flubromazepam # #Clonazolam# #etizolam# skype: kerrychemltd wickr: kerrychemltd
Can’t we just get another Friday the 13th movie
Ok I.M.P from helluva boss time to send him to Hell!
Michael still hasn't spoken a word.
Yeah, keep milking it
Omg I thought they gonna make after 40 years 😂 who like me?
I knew it👀👀👀
Laurie: Evil dies tonight   Michael: I'm three parallel universes ahead of you
Me: has body shield and a mini gun  Micheal: your not that guy pal your not that guy
This nigga like lil Reese he jus can’t die
This is so far looking to be the biggest and best horror movie ever!
I like that one part Laurie "you want your mask? Come and get it!: Looks like Micheal can't hide behind his mask anymore.
Don't need to see the movie now! The trailer shows all the killings!
I am so ready!!!
"Evil dies tonight" Halloween Ends: Am I a joke to you?
He not gonna die he on demon time forever 😈😂
okay but how did he live lol
Never really felt bad for a death in a movie, but to be honest, I kind of felt bad for the fire fighters .
“Evil dies tonight”  Laughs in “Halloween Kills Kills”
I cant hardly wait to see this but I knew he was alive because they tried to burn him 3 times now come on wen have u ever seen Halloween  wit ,a happy satisfied ending?
Unfortunately this doesn’t seem scary at all. Just seems like Michael going around bashing heads. And they’ll probably do the same thing in the next movie
N. H. II- Faithful Poems 1-3, N. H. II- Poems of Love 1-5, and Noel Haynes II Packages are on YouTube, and you can check them out now.  Here is a link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItObR40-TTU
So hyped for this! Who’s gonna see it the day it comes out??
“Evil dies tonight” man it was supposed to die 40 years ago
I can't wait to watch this. Halloween have always been my favorite I hope they continue to come out with more while Jamie Lee Curtis is still alive because everybody is getting old its life.
Best Halloween sequel ever? Nod to Halloween III seals it!
Will decapitation work?  He’s killing a lot of black people, he must be stopped.
Social distancing and wearing a mask in public since 1978!
Shit trailer
let me guess... he dies in the end but not really?
Gotta give that last firefighter some credit for revving up that saw and ready to fight back
This video should have zero dislikes
I’m sure Jason and Freddy are laughing right now
What is the crowd chanting at 1:48?
Damn just show the whole fucking move why don't ya
Four more months 'til Halloween! Silver Shamrock!
so i'm guessing that knife is a demon slaying knife?  From the demon realm?  created years ago and sealed for the right time?  to kill michael?
Y'all tell me if I'm wrong but I remember Jamie Lee Curtis having a son and not a daughter in the old Halloween films.
He better kill a million people in this movie considering you showed so many kills in one trailer
“I’m coming for you Michael” sis what that little target kitchen knife gone do at this point? 😂
Wow
AMC to the moon
Well I don’t really need to watch the film now. Trailer pretty much showed everything. Also since there is yet another film (Halloween ends) pretty sure he will survive yet again.   Or just rewrite it again and we all pretend it didn’t happen. Not hate btw just saying 🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃
1:33 good reference to "halloween III🎃"
This looks fucking amazing
Boooo! Too many spoilers!!
The end has come
I just whole movie with this trailer (I’m high)
I can’t wait 🤤
Bruh dis man don’t die😭
sick ,, stupid ... same plot  no hero .... stupid movie
Shut up and take my money
Laurie: evil die tonight Me: wait among us dynamite parody?
Michael Myers should be in his 70’s by now😂😂🤦🏾‍♂️ He need to collect his killer career pension and retire.
This nigga never dies 😂 I can’t wait tho
Not going to be good, they showed the hole movie in the trailer, what a bummer!👎🏽🤮
Laurie: Evil will die.  Micheal: Bruh we have like another movie after this.
This is so dumb, how many they gonna make😐
Evil dies tonight   Michel: the studio don't say so
Man, after all this time, she just doesn’t die, hopefully he succeeds in this one
Jeez between the elderly man surviving a fire and multiple fatal injuries and the acting skills of the others the belief is suspended somewhere on fucking mars 🤣 ....this movie looks awesome.
This looks sick David, Danny and crew! Loving the imagery and cinematography!
This looks good
5 seconds in front of a 50 cal he would be reduced to a pile of chum mask and all.
DEAD MEAT WHERE YOU AT
They shoulda made the movie more suspenseful without showing all the deaths
Who else felt for those Fire Fighters just doing there duty unknowingly driving to there deaths
Is this a new movie or this a old movie ?
The scariest senior citizen on the planet
Michael Myers’ knife: Now that’s a lot of Damage
Dead meat right now : 👁👄👁   Shaking in his kill count boots
Everyone is waiting every Kill counter everyone!
No no no no no noooooo
OOOOOOOOOOOOO I'M WATCHING I'M WATCHING I'M I TOTALLY WATCHING ONCE I GET A JOB AND. MAKE MY OWN MULA IMMA GO TO THE THEATERS AND WATCH IT IDFC IF I'M BY MYSELF
FUCKIN LIT !!!
Seems like a combination of lame story and cool kills. So, y'know, a Halloween movie.
Ok but Friday the 13th completely dies, cool not like we want a new movie with Jason fucking some dudes up
ikyfl
Laurie: “evil dies tonight”  The Director: “….. WHO LET HER SAY THAT LINE”?!
Hopefully this is the last Michael Myers movie ever. Fucking stupid. Hollywood needs to take the chance on a new original slasher villain.
Fuckin Jamie Lee Curtis always bringing it, absolutely love it!
broski cant die
I can't wait to see Michael's face
whatever protein shake michael myers is on , I need some of that.....the man be overpowering everybody
looks great but hey maybe next time dont show the fucking kills
Halloween is ok but I want A Nightmare on Elm of Friday the 13th
Gotta spend another 20 dollars just to wonder if he dies at the end again
“I met him, 15 years ago; I was told there was nothing left; no reason, no conscience, no understanding in even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this... six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and... the blackest eyes - the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up, because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.”  -Dr. Sam Loomis
The hospital set up is a good call back to the original Halloween 2
Enough already! We get it Micheal will never die.
I don’t want Michael to ever loose I want him to keep killing deadass
This trailer is cool but it spoils a lot of shit
Can this be the last one? It’s literally the same thing over and over again it’s not interesting to watch anymore. It’s not scary and it’s just boring now. Am I the only one who thinks this?
Seriously Jamie move to a different state…
1:34 "Happy Happy Halloween! Halloween! Halloween! Happy Happy Halloween! Silver Shamrock!
Come on, this is becoming ridiculous
Okay we get it, he doesn’t die. He literally never dies.
ok and the winner of this year to make a draw for halloween is Michael Myers and the other killer to i plain draw is Jason Voorhees, so i will to make the present for my aunt first and later follows the horror movies icons, greetings
Well hello Dean Munsch🤣
I like how they all hooked up with the taking his mask bit
Legend has it HE’S STILL ALIVE AFTER THIS MOVIE 🍿
Ya, having firefighters getting slaughtered, classy move to make money...
Sucks
They completely ditched the whole “he’s a supernatural immortal killer” so I wonder how the will be able to kill Micheal, who is incredibly smart when killing.
2:13 why does this part looks fake, Michael isn’t even tryna act😂
😎😎🤟
OCTOBER 29TH, YOU SEEN IT HERE FIRST, THE FRIDAY BEFORE HOLLOWEEN
the fucking season of the witch masks
This looks good, my only issue with it is did n’t Michael get his hand partially blown off in the first movie? Looks to me like homeboy grew his hand back…
dude i'm sorry the second halloween sucked. why are they making more
*Can't wait*
This looks like the death scenes will be epic.
They gave away most of the possibly good kills
*These kill scenes look like one of my nightmares* 😩
I'm so exciting this😍🔥
The biggest question is... why did they go in the house without a charged line?
Gees how many times are they gonna "kill" him?
Yeah it,s back 😎📽✌ #haloween
Dude: pulls out chainsaw  Michael: your not that guy pal your that guy
I miss when new movies were made. Now it's just cash in sequels and reboots
@ 1:33 Season of the witch mask cameos.
Probably just seen the best bits of the film.
sometimes i wish i was a kid again.. only then would scary movies actually be scary
Look as shitty as the rest of them 🤷‍♂️
Yeah Michael is back
Knife > Guns ?
Looks just as bad as the last 12. 🤦😂
Let this franchise die already.... The last good one was Halloween 2 back in 1980 or 81
That first scene was intense af
Let’s gooo
This scene with the firefighters looks brutal
42 years of Halloween…..going strong!!! This one looks good!!
That orchestra though! The theme sounds amazing in strings! Can’t wait for this.
🔥Mike Myer’z🔥
Old man strength Michael OH NOOOO he was already crazy strong
a little over the top
🔥Halloween🔥
Am I the only one who was excited about the Season of the Witch masks???
¡Qué maldita emoción!
cant wait 🎃
He better kill everybody
She says "he dies tonight" in every movie
Looks awful, they should’ve stopped after the 1981 sequel.
Laurie: "evil dies tonight"  Michael: "...welp Yes but Actually NO"
0:43 Top 10 Anime Fights
YEAHH BOI
I like how at 2:11 especially you can see they brought back the blue lighting from the original which is awesome
Fuckin John carpenter went full send on the gore !!!!!
It should've been Michael V.S. Jason not Freddy!-pfffft!!
man they really spoiling all the best kills in the trailer huh
Wow way to show every kill in the movie including Michael. Can't believe this was given the green light to be shown. Horror runs on suspension and shock and if its all spoiled in the trailer then its a wash.
NONONONO!!!! LET IT BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURN!!!!!  Micheal: HOLA NINOS!  (inspired by a TikTok.)
"The same procedure as every year, James."
Thanks for showing us the whole film
oh wow
Universal: "Evil dies tonight"  Also Universal: "A sequel, Halloween Ends, scheduled for October 2022"
Ya para que ver la película si en este trailer ya vi todo
James a janese would be so excited
James a janese: lets goooo
Yeah Michael Myers is back omg
Hollywood needs to get some new ideas. Same movies from 1988 just remade like shit.
Great concept, hunt him.
Imagine if Jason comes out
How many times u will make a remake of this movie.....its old
Laurie: Evil dies tonight  Michael (in the very deep and menacing voice of James Earl Jones): No...You will
Eight more days til Halloween.....Halloween.....Halloween.....
Well they just spoiled the whole movie in this trailer.
dw guys a pallet will stun him 😂
“evil dies tonight”  Michael: “You’re not that guy, pal. You’re not that guy.”
This guy has a grudge
Here we go again...       again.
Send *JASON*
Don’t kill Kyle!!! :((( #rhobh lol
I'm gonna watch it!👍
that body count though
Easter eggs from Halloween 3 I see
Laurie: we did it we killed him  Michael: did you tho?!?!?!?!?!?!
The final begins.
Definitely Have To See This 🤑🥳😈on god
Laurie: evil dies tonight!  Michael: oh hell no!
Very curious of boxoffice predictions for this.   I will definitely be there opening night
Im digging the new version of the Halloween Theme. Is that strings in there? Like a MEAN Cello? Sounds so good!
I think we just saw the whole movie in this one clip 😐
YOOOOOOOO

To quote the late great Doctor. "This isn't a man I tell you!"

Man come on bruh we saw the flames engulf him this is bull.
Too much money to be made yet
Laurie: "Evil dies tonight."  Universal Pictures: "as long as we make money...No."   Also Universal Pictures: "Let's Milk Halloween dry."

This looks good chile 👁👄👁
Plzzz stop the franchise
Imagine pawn stars do a deal with Michael Myers
Why would firemen walk into a burning building if they don't know someone is in there.
Hollywood and the Perfume Industry must be closely linked .... Halloween 12 = Hugo Boss Bottled  flankers.....or Ralph Lauren Polo Red, Blue , Black & Baby Puke Green
Jokes aside this is a pretty fucking cool trailer
Man these movies are boring. But still not as bad as the Shining. Now that movie is a real snorefest😴.
Carl Johnson: Oh shit, Here we go again.
hes been active since 1978 lol so he must be 60 by now
Anna frank 🤪
Jesus loves you❤️
So, the whole town is suppose to be coming after Michael Myers in this one? How would there be another movie after this one if a bunch of people are going after him? I don’t care how tough or crazy u are. U ain’t gonna be able to take down a whole town lol. Unless, Michael is just as evil in this one and the last as he was in all of the others.
I’m just saying an A.R. 15 would knock Michael Myers off the face of the planet
this is gay. Leave it up to Universal Pictures to butcher this. This movie is exposing michael myers to the world apparently, but i promise you there wont be any cia/fbi/special forces on this AT ALL which will make this all really stupid to try and contain it for a small town in a digital world. #universalpictures let me guess, at the end there'll be a clue that he's still alive? Exposing him to the town is the worst idea ever. I hope he kills them all xD  How about for a change we kill everyone and let Michael Myers remove the entire bloodline. Michael's Revenge (let the bad guy literally win--we all want him to anyways) That's right, time to kill Jamie Lee whatever her name is--and keep the Halloween series brutal and unapologetic!
I am asking me, what happens, if you put Michael into acid? Bullets do not really work on him, but acid could do.
when she says “LET HIM BURN” i got chills
I've seen all the Halloween films and I can't wait for Halloween Kills!
How many bodies has that kitchen knife caught lmao
Damn. I actually like that the victims seem to be putting in more of a fight. Makes Michel look even more terrifying cause you just can't beat him. Makes it kickers actually.
Instead of “DOOOO ITTT” she should have said, “Your not that guy pal”
Awesome
The trailers aren’t even suspenseful anymore….sigh.
The Greatest story line in horror movies,Jamie Lee Curtis,fighting back against her brother!!!
Michael myers never dies
Love that season of the witch Easter egg
Season of the witch masks!
i feel like michael myers is a god in the series
FUCK YES!
yes yes yes, the killing goes on🔪🔪
Did anyone notice the Halloween 3 references?
They all gonna be eaten alive ☠️🔪 like Rambo they're not Hunting Michael, Michael is Hunting them.
😎🤟🏻nice can’t wait..
Wouldn’t that mask melt from the fire ?
Been waiting for this for a while now!!
Is he immortal or what? I need answers…
Thanks for the free movie
Ain’t gonna lie, that cello just took it to a whole new level
Dude - did they have to show so much of the intense parts!?  Now I feel like I've seen the majority of the movie
For the people who like endless repeats of endless remakes 😂. I got 3 seconds in and clicked off, next up Friday the 19th 😂😂
I pray anyone who reads this is successful in life 🙏
I KNEW IT IN THE END OF FHE FIRST MOVIE IT DIDNT SHOW HIM BURN SO I KNEW IT HE WASNET DEAD
This first movie is pretty good, so hoped they learned from it so they can make a good sequel
A new Halloween movie?
The masks are a sick reference 1:33
Is Jason ever going to comeback? still hyped for this movie tho 👍😎
Laurie: “evil dies tonight”  Michael:”hold my beer”
"Let's go on vacation next Halloween so maybe Michael will grow up and learn to behave."
Pack ya bags boys we're goin hunting THIS ENDS NOW!!!
I can't wait to see this movie
**New Michael Myers trailer** Jason: Am I a joke to you?
Does michelle myers just not want to fucking die?
People:kill him michael:shing shing shing shing
The way he exits that house is like he’s emerging from the flames of hell… it’s like a call back to Halloween 5 where Loomis tells Sheriff Meeker: “I prayed that he would burn in hell…but in my heart I knew that hell would not have him..” chilling… and fucking iconic.
Yeah. Stopped half way throug. Dont wanna spoil it. Seems like another gem!!
this movie is the reason i love halloween😂 im so excited!!!
ThT was intense
The Halloween franchise is like Dj Khaled another one🤣🤦🏾‍♂️
They are literally milking these films now lol
Come on Micheal! 🎃🔪🔥 37 kills needed to surpass Jason Vorhees!
Halloween and the furious 10 😂 think of something new!!!
Do itttt!! U not gotta tell Michael that twice😅
so glad i was allyson for halloween in 2020, guess i know what im being in 2021 >:)
Holy shit. They turned The shape from Dead by daylight into a movie
If he dies in this movie then that’s cheesy as fuck
The Halloween 3 masks. That’s fun
Looks amazing, but damn did they show way too much in the trailer. Awful trailer. It should tease you to pique your interest, not blow the whole plot.
Bart Scott: CAN'T WAIT
Michael need da be n mortal Kombat
1:46-1:53 I can imagine Michael saying, “I’m just built different!”
I love horror movies and I’m a definitely a fan of most of the Halloween movies but this one look fake asl it don’t look like it’s going to be good booooo
Hmmm... those sweet sweet "season of the witch" masks... Nice.
Haha I love how he comes out the house as himself and not a fireman 👨‍🚒
One more movie for the kill counts woo hoo!!
Laurie is going to go out in this movie and we all know it
I love the Halloween 3 - Reference (the 3 Masks)
If all those fire fighters jumped on him with everything they all wouldn’t have died 😂
now how the hell he kill all them firemen? 🙄🙄🙄🙄 i been keeping up with this storyline for 40 years i am TIRED damn can they just end it already? and i’m literally 17 i been watching these movies FOREVER cmon now
Lmaoo I swear this movie came out like 10 times🤣
when are people going to realize this man has a fire resistance potion on
YESSSSSSSSSSSS
Michael will be eligible to retire and collect social security next year. Google says he was born on October 19, 1957. It is time for him to join AARP and get some Medicare for his injuries.
Wtf Fr ? Are they really gonna kill Lonnie Tommy Lindsey and Nurse Chambers all in the same movie why bring them back then ?
Awesome trailer me and my family loved it!! One thing I hope they have better music in the movie then they do in this trailer :(

Micheal after every movie: "impaled, burned, decapitated and quite literally disemboweled" The next movie  Micheal " henlo"
We all know how this will end. Michael ain't going nowhere🤣🤣🤣
Whens the movie coming out?
I promise we are still gonna come see these iconic films, without showing everything in the trailers.   Less is more….

Michel is the devil from hell
That looks scary
Yes the firefighter is saving our master
I’m not sure I need to watch it now thanks!
YES, can’t wait for the kill count!
I hope they make more like this man I'm tired of watching ghost movies I wanna see sum stalkers nd slashers
They need to Busta Rhymes to come back if they need to beat Myers.   Yes I know that Halloween movie was terrible, but Busta made it look funny and cool.😂
I just saw the whole movie!!!!!!
2 things: a., who else thought that was carol from the walking dead?   and b., this looks trash. let it go. come up with some new ideas. hollywood sucks ass.
Don’t let Michael get tier 3
That fire scene was so cheesy lol
He back swag Myers I back :)
Man I can’t wait 🔥🔥🔥🔥😎 this is going to be good I was wondering when all the running would stop 🛑
Michael Meyers: You fought bravely in your house, to the bitter end. I trust this time will be no diffrent...
He den got more scary and evil
I will never watch other Michael Myers. Because they make other Episodes of that,  scary 😦 👻
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
yea
i hope mista gg makes a review on this bc im interested
I seen that Halloween III easter egg. With the Shamrock Halloween masks!
I can't wait to not watch this.  Hollywood.....home of the creatively bankrupt
this trailers got so many kills wtf
Gotta scroll every 15 comments to find an actual opinion on trailers these days, lol. When did everyone decide to just post a “word meme” instead of wanting to talk about the trailer? Eh, all good. I’m gonna go whine and complain about something else trivial now. 😆🤘
Why aren't more people talking about the masks from Halloween 3? Is that canon in this universe now?
The firefighters god damm what do we do   Michael Myers it’s time to kill
I haven't seen the movies yet, but is Micheal ever regarded as pure human evil? Like an incarnate of all things cruel and relentless? Human evil has to exist so that humanity (good and love) can be treasured for what it is. And you can't kill (get rid of) evil, its exists in all of us one way or another. Micheal is just the living interpretation of that
This is gonna be fucking awesome
Maikal I am waiting for you
so corny but sooo good
Laurie: evil dies tonight  Micheal: hello there🔪
“Evil dies tonight” Michael: *Rip and Tear*
But... you are already spoiling all the deaths 🤣
Did anyone else get the chills when watching this? Ha!! I was slightly let down in the last movie when they ended it with them burning Michael in the cellar, but we all know that he can't die by fire, so it made sense to do that to make another movie. But I love the last movie, and I'm ready for another saga of Halloween!! I'm going to see this movie on October 15! Let's see what becomes of Michael's fate of whether it's continuing his hell on earth, or if the masses finally subdue the evil of evils. Let's prepare for another chapter of Michael Myers.
seesh!....how many times is micheal myers gonna die...I remember h20 back in 98 when she decapitated him, it should've been over then....I can't wait till cinemasins gets a hold of this😅
Ok now this is getting ridiculous, Halloween needs to stop
Well, they showed too much.... as all trailers normally do these days.  P.S. Freddy is way better than this Voorhees knockoff.
Please push this release up
Everybody gangsta till Michael hold an axe
The large scale stuff makes him less intimidating. Micheal has always been more terrifying blending in and striking under the radar.. now we have this Frankenstein type mob? I hope the kill scenes are creative and brutal but not over the top. The MM Halloween franchise has always been the most terrifying since its been the most realistic.. I hope they dont tank this movie with politics or saw type nonsense.
cant wait
Blumhouse took over production...this movie is going to suck.
Like to review it in my native language.
Epic Firefighter scenes
Thank god this might be the end 😭😭😭
Can’t Wait! 😁 🎃
The “Silver Shamrock” masks at 1:33, nice touch.
Firefighters coulda swarmed him instead of going 1v1
I'm only here to see what kind of movie James is gonna make a video on Edit: apparently this movie is gonna have the most kills ever...   James, this is your dream movie
Let the lore be good
0:41 - now THAT just makes it more scarier.
They have to have Michael win at the end to lead in the next movie
Laurie: Evil dies tonight.  Michael Myers: No, I don't think I will.
So now they finna hunt him down abt fkn time smh
KEEP MILIKING IT.. TAKE MY MONEY EVERY TIME. ILL KEEP PAYING 😀 ROB ZOMBIES VERSION WAS THE BEST 1
I can't tell if these people are idiots or GENIUS. They went on the offence and tried killing him the second they saw him
Why can't people be smart and buy guns and try to make a spot where they can ambush him then shoot him once they ambush him then shoot him more when they think he is dead then seal him in a coffin 10 feet down low that is sealed in metal  and encase it in a even harder metal coffin
So this is like "Town tries to kill Michael Myers". And they all just epic fail. I guess that's interesting
Discord mod when his kitten leaves him for another discord mod
I'm excited, these are amazing movies!
Pretty soon black people are going to have to step in and end this
Please stop. Enough is enough. This is stupid.
This looks lame
I can’t wait
Michael using god mode cheat code
Wow, now you showed  me the almost the entire movie, assholes
I CANT WAITTTTTTT
Jamie Lee Curtis' hairline dies tonight.
Can I just say everyone's comments are priceless 😂😂
Oh stop
Got damn did they mean to play the whole movie just now…feel like i watched the whole movie just now.
After the original Halloween it should’ve been done. Nothing but disappointing sequels after that. This one looks no different. Put it to bed already!!! No one knows how to make a horror movie anymore!
Karens:we cant breath properly with masks Micheal myres:so i could breath with a mask in a room full of smoke
Nice "Season of the witch" reference.
Laurie: “evil dies tonight” Universal Pictures: "I don't know about that..."
At least Michael is responsible enough to obey Covid measures and is wearing a mask, so I guess he is really a liberal at heart....
story recap: michel wants to go home and chop some vegetables but gets hunted by deranged old lady and angry townfolk
Obra de arte 😍❤
I love that its the whole town trying to kill Michael
Michael Myers is more aggressive than ever he's now killing elderly people for what reason?
Michael: “and then she said evil dies tonight HAHAHA”
Bruh if they kill him off I swear Halloween will never be the same again ik he gave a us nightmares as a child but fr tho they better not end him
Maybe we need a horror cross over like Jason Vs Halloween, would be epic
I love seeing the whole movie for free in 2 minutes.
Halloween movies 1 through 4 are the only ones that are connected to each other every other Halloween movie stands in its own reality the original director will even tell you so also Rob zombie ruined the Halloween movie franchise
It takes a Michael to kill a Michael..solution? Death by suïcide 🙂
Thanks for showing basically the whole movie. Now I dont have to pay for it 👍🏻
Michael vs Thanos
WOW
EEEEK I CANT WAIT YUSSS
if michael myers was in warzone , hes gotta big fat bounty
showed the whole movie. looks like poop
Laurie: “That monster dies tonight!”   Micheal Myers: “Hmm no. You never killed me in my Halloween 2018 movie 🍿 And u never will! I’ll just keep killing and killing to I die. Eh 🤔
YOURE KIDDING ME YES
Laurie has Decisive Strike and Unbreakable she'll be fine
Anyone else hyped they incorporated the Halloween 3 masks? It’s one of my favorite from the franchise and besides it getting so much hate the fact they threw those masks in is amazing.
Oh great... here we go again.
Thanks trailer for showing us the whole movie 👍🏻
So is that the end of the Michael Myers franchise or is there still a part left?
DUDE !!!!!
Will this shit ever end. It’s gotten ridiculous.
Huh......one man army vs a village mob......ok let's see how this plays out shall we😃
Halloween kills the next Halloween movie from next year is Halloween ends
i ain't even watching this trailer im experiencing it all in theatres brand new.
John Carpenter!!
chile he done kilt kyle richards 2:00
I thought this was a dead meat video
Michael straight up killed 20 people in the trailer lmao
I hate these violent and killing movies
1:40 "Let's hunt him down".  Me: Pretty sure someone in there is gonna say "Let's split up". Everyone get killed. Why don't they just jump him like gang initiations and be done?
DAYUM
Of course he's not dead. I dunno what I was thinking
“Evil dies tonight” She’s musta said that same line in the last 30 Halloween movies. Let it go already
I'm excited for this
https://youtube.com/channel/UC1EPeTHVTzEg3rd_FeTW2aQ
Is it still horror when they're chasing the monster instead of the monster chasing them?
Shoutout the firefighter that came at Michael with the chainsaw he went out like a G
In real life, one man is not defeating a bunch of firefighters tho.
Yeeeeeeeaaaàaahhh!!!!!
KYLE RICHARDS!!!!!! 💕💕💕
So Hyped for this movie
Give him a snickers
I just hope Jamie makes it to the next movie
How many times are they going to kill his sister 😂😂
Laurie: Evil dies tonight  Michael: And I took that personally
Can someone explain how he’s still alive in the past movies he’s been shot over a thousand times is he like supernatural??
Michael walking out of the fire is strangely appealing!
🔥🔥🔥
OH MY GOSHHH MY BOY MYERS BACK!
“I prayed in my heart he would go to Hell but I knew Hell would not have him”   RIP Dr Loomis
Shit looks bomb
Thought this nigga was rip in the chat for good but i guess not 🤣🤣
Looks shit , overproduced unlike the subtlety of the original ..
They even got a reference to the 3rd one in this one this shit about to be a hoot and a holler
That close up of Micheal's mask looks a lot like Laurie.
The silver shamrock masks!! 😱
Showed way too much!!!
“Am coming for you Michel”    : Michel hahaha idgfa
This is bullshit know it doesn’t even feel real sounds so fake tbh
Like the never ending Fast and the Furious franchise people forget that Halloween is also about Family
Well this looks amazing
🕴
Yes !!!!
Everyone: But you died in the fire  Michael: My death was greatly exaggerated
I think time michael will actually meet his end
This man never dies 💀
WAIT IS THIS REAL?? CAUSE IF IT IS IM SOEXITWDD
I’m hyper for this movie
I hope this one isn’t a flop like the last movie . Coming from a long time fan .
Jae Lee Curtis prolly dies I'm this one
Yeah I believe they all did in the end but not Michael
I have watched the trailer but i love it sooooo much so si decided to watch it again
I think 🤔 awesome 👏
Yang ditunggu2 hahay
👏Another masterpiece from John Carpenter, can't wait to see this horror flick when it comes out online,  I knw it will probably come out before Halloween. One of many great anticipated horror flicks coming out this year😎💯 Thanks Mr.Carpenter and Jaime Lee Curtis you guys are F***** Awesome!💪 💯
Is It Weird That I Don’t Want Micheal To Die
Why do I feel like I watched the whole movie?!? 😐 but looks good 😂
dun-dun-duuuunnnnn omg Michael isn’t dead what a plot twist I totally thought he was dead
Girl: DO IT DO IT! Michael: ok
Plz just stop
Let's face it.  He isn't gonna die.
Come on man, Not the firefighters!  Can i get an F in chat for the mad lad who tried to fight him with a saw
OMG❗️😆😆😆 I Can Not Wait 💃🏾
i’m so hype for this, michael said “i’m coming for everyone” AND HES HEADING HOME?
Omg I can't waiiiittt
Let it go
on october 15, 2021 it all ends 💔
I must admit Micheal was a busy guy 🤣
Definitely the most gruesome non red band trailer I have ever seen.  Not complaining.
Dude, let this Halloween go and find something new. It’s old fashion story! Be more creative!
Damn what's gonna happen when Jamie finally goes
How come they haven’t made any Jason films
We need a good Jason movie.
How the fuck did he not die
Wow that looks good 😌
Hes still not gonna die after this movie, at the end theyre gonna play a clip of his heart beating or something. Michael never dies
This looks amazing!  👍
There's one man he can't kill the camera man
Looks so stupid lmao, what has become of this movie franchise
It had me till the town hunted him like the fucking purge series.  Ehh I'll firestick it when it drops
couple of kids kill Michael but why didint they just like call the national guard
Them: Halloween kills(Michael Myers) Also me at first glance: Jason's twin brother?🤔
Laurie” Evil dies tonight!   Blumhouse: Not until end of Halloween part 42….then maybe!
Me and my girlfriend was going to see this but she passed away in April
Yes about time another halloween movie is coming out
love this trailer, hope the movie holds up
Laurie: “evil dies tonight”  Me knowing there’s another movie coming: no evil dies in the next movie
Michaella why did you kill those firefighters

If there’s a scene where the townspeople go at him like Thanos, I’ll fucking lose it.
Remember when they didn’t show 2/3 of a movie in trailers
I would’ve ended this fool in the first movie
When are we going to get a new Friday the 13th 😭
he is 57 for goodness sake and doing this shit what the hell
Amo al puto de Michael Myers
Michael teams up with Vin Diesel for Fast and furious 10, ‘Fast10 your seatbelts’.
How is the Michae age? I’m 39 and think i will die first than him
Halloween 2018 was garbage.  Hopefully this movie isn't somehow worse.  I hate how they continue to capitalize on the Halloween franchise.  Just stop at this point
That woman in the Nurse Costume at 1:27 is in the first Halloween(2018) when they do that follow shot of Michael walking the neighborhood. The detail in these movies 👌
All along Micheal has been on creative mode while were in survival
Why do they show so much in a trailer. It’s so annoying dam
another sequel no one wants or asked for. Please...PLEASE...just stop. Its comical at this point.
🔥
This cool asf
They’re showing off too many kills in the trailer FOR FUCK SAKES
Well damn he never dies 🤣
Entire town: you took everything from us!!!  Michael Myers: 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Is anyone going to comment on the dead bodies wearing the Halloween 3 season of the witch masks?
There should be a Texas Chainsaw Halloween Massacre where it's about Michael Myers Vs Leatherface
Do you want your mask back? Mike Myers- Ya baby. It make me randy
funny thing is tho theres another halloween coming out after this one so like everyones gonna die the last one will be entertainining
😮‍💨 Laurie Stoude Gotta be TIRED! she been running since before I was born!
Kind of showed us too much but still might see it
This man never died wth 😭
I couldn’t help but smile seeing those Halloween 3 masks again 😁
Looks a movie worth seeing 🍿!!!!!
I honestly don’t care. I’m just excited to watch this.
The franchise still alive
First day on the job as a figherfighter... I think i will quit
Lol....the franchise turned into a total cash grab 💯😅
The People Vs. Michael Myers!   Verdict: Death By Riot.
Dude like its not hard to win the 1v1 if you're a ways away with a machine gun
123
This dude deserves his own reality tv show. Like keeping up with the Myers.
Wow another Michael Myers movie 😒 Wow more of my money going towards the same franchise again 😂
Why don't they just show every victim that he kills and every good part of the movie? Oh wait they almost just did. This trailer is way too revealing.
It looks like an angry mob is trying to get to Laurie Strode to sacrifice her to Michael to make him stop while another angry mob is trying to kill Michael
Let'it burn 😵
For the love of god please stop with these movies
They just showed the whole movie
Anybody else notice the masks from Halloween 3 🥰
Why make another Friday the 13th film not a hollowen
🎃Esperándola
Sigh here we go again
That's a lot of damage
Evil never dies its always there in every shadow behind every closet door under every bed the boogie man will always be there no matter how peaceful and good things may seem evil is always there waiting its yeng and yang good and evil the light and the dark you cant have one without the other .....
Carol
Only the box office take decides if/when evil dies.
You want your mask? Come and get it! I can’t 🤦🏻‍♂️
Why they showing too muchhhh
Man I can’t wait for the new Michael Miles movie
Lori just trying to get her team killed so she can find hatch
I Can’t wait
Can't wait to see it!!!!!!
Nobody:  Michael Myers: I’m gonna slash you, gash you, cut another hole in your ass, I spill blood on the walls and play tennis with your balls 😂😂😂😂
Not another of these dumpster fire movies! For crying out loud!
Michael: You know all she have to do was take me trick-or-treating
So your telling this foo cured his wounds from the last movie AND didnt come out with out a single burn or didnt suffocate from all that smoke!!?? I'm starting to think hes really a terminator instead of a real human or iam I just high?
We're gonna fight him, again! But this time he dies, tonight! Again! For the umpteenth time! We promise! -Jamie Lee Curtis (134 yrs old)
Shii getting boring
I have so much faith in this ..how hard is it to make a good Halloween movie ..im honestly satisfied with the trailer
Why is it so gory lmaoooo , I mean the original ones had a few brutal killings but not much gore these are something else
POV: You come back to a game you played five years ago and forgot you're OP as fuck
Wow
Yessss ... I’m Here for it!!!
Thanks for showing the whole movie
At this point Halloween and fast and furious are in competition lol
No need to see the movie.  The trailer shows too many kill scenes
Looks good can't wait we need something good out of this shit
This movie is gonna be the movie if the year lol
does anybody know when jason new friday the 13th is relaseing i think this movie is flopped when is it coming in big screen, and the news texas chainsaw?
Omg that looks really good. But I het he'll still survive lmfaooo
Remember when trailers didnt give away the entire plot of the movie?
Dead Meat will have a real field day with this one
I can't wait!!!!!
Michael Myers is immortal
Its so weird that all these people can't even kill Michael and I bet you 100,000 dollars that the old rag lady will be the one to kill him
Another one
Lame
Laurie:he can’t hurt anyone again  Michael:”kills someone”I’m sorry what?
beating a dead horse
He just killed the entire fire department
Milking it.
Laurie: "Evil dies tonight"  Michael: R1, R2, L1, X, LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT, UP, LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT, UP
Looks great I wish Zombie had a hand in it I like the Rob Zombie versions
Cant wait till Halloween
I want him to die because he never dies over the years of the movie
🔥
Lmao this looks like 💩
So Michael is like how old now? about 85 and he is still killing? lol
Michael vs Rambo vs John wick vs terminator for the undisputed Heavyweight champ
Meh.
The Silver Shamrock masks!
Damn this movie is going to have a a lot of kills
Get ready Mr Janisse.
Townsfolk: KILL HIM  Michael: *ACTIVATE INSTANT KILL*
He’s not dead yet???? Didn’t the 1st movie come out in the 70’s? Jamie Lee Curtis is a grandma now and she still can’t kill him.
Can't wait ❤
Love how they’re putting a spin on the whole hospital setting since Halloween 2 apparently isn’t canon anymore
Laurie- ‘Evil dies tonight’ Michael- *laughs in tier 3
I want see this
Oh wow he got out Damm
Feel like the trailer showed me the whole movie…bring on part 3
Could Aaron Be back

LETS GO!!!!!
Omg can’t wait
Good thing Michael Myers is in the movie to have a white male representation
It's a horrific thought... but a team of the baddest mother fookers aka firemen had to take on one guy....firefighters win.
if  i made this  movie  i swaer  to god  idd make  it  world  wide  hit         buget  of  600  million dollars  to  bad  gthis  is  a low  budget  movie
me, a legendary hitman with a score of 500 kills: do you want to die Michael?
them silver shamrock masks tho
Jesus fucking Christ… when is enough enough with these movies. Lol
Wife an I been looking for a good kitchen knife, *stumbles into this video
It’s 2021 and for some reason they still can’t kill him ? 🔪
Carol is bout to fuck him up big time
If they don’t kill him this time imma have to step in...
Laurie: Evil dies tonite  Me: No, majority of Haddenfield dies tonite
Here we go again showing killing scenes
I could literaly watch endless sequels of Halloween. Gives me such thrills and excitement to see Michael alive and breathing, going on a spree on Hallows' Eve.
My dad predicted this…
This halloween theme song sounds like a dubstep remix
Can't wait to see this movie. Been waiting to see what Charles Cyphers as sheriff Brackett and Kyle Richards   as Lindsey roles will be in the movie. I want them to be in the last movie also. Don't kill them off.
Okay   1. Why does Mike feel like John Wick in this lmao.  2. Holy fuck they took his mask.
Damn Michael Myers goes beast mode and Massacre the cops and firefighters damn I heard a the death count is going to be biggest
At this point the only thing that could kill em is a nuke
Imagine if there was a scene in this/ the next film where Michael is in the hospital, and he encounters a very sick patient in a room who wants to end their life. The patient begs for Michael to kill them and end their pain. Instead of killing the patient (or  even leaving them to suffer) Micheal  goes up to the patient, and starts making cuts on the patients body while They scream in pain. After that, Michael leaves the room and leaves the patient in pain.
I haven’t been this excited for a movie in a while
Why not
He is back😟
YES!!!!!
He will never die
idk why she just didnt shoot the fuck outta him
She gonna be 85 still tryna kill michael😒when they gonna stop makin these halloween  movies😒🙄😂 annoying af
So all the kills were spoiled in the trailer? Smh.
My favorite part this is when Michael walks outta the burning house like nothing , jus BADASS !
let me guess they're gonna "kill" him at the end of this one but he survives like the other 86263484 films
New Michael Myers movies on Halloween month always gets people pump up
me: **aiming a **50.cal** sniper in his head from 1km away** take this
Hes like rambo
The skull, witch and pumpkin masks are the masks from Halloween III. Cute.
Firefighters were gangsters. They actually attacked him
Something about Michael's theme playing on a cello and piano brings a unique yet equally terrifying element to the sounds matching the picture. I like it
“Do it. DOOO IIIITTT” Michael: *does it* Everyone: *massive surprise*
When the next Jason or Freddy Krueger coming out? Micheal had too much spotlight
So...that dry a$$ hair didn't burn? And...the mask didn't melt to his face and scalp?🤔🤷🏼‍♀️🤦🏿‍♀️
I liked the Halloween 3 masks
This trailer: exist Dead meat: its free Real estate
Firefighters: **Breathes**  Michael: “And I took that Personally”
2:23 - 2:26 DAMN, old Tommy & Laurie look ready this time! 😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄
Another Halloween movie and I’m still not disappointed haha. Looking forward to this one 😃
0:35 to 0:47 did they all just stood there the whole time? They don’t know who he is? Didn’t they just seem dude walk out of the burning house with evil intentions signal by the way that he was holding the axe?? Jesus, I know fireman are brave but you should run away from the hazard this time.
Do we need another one of these fucking movies? Apparently the creative well has run dry...
I am calling alot of bull shit on this one of he survives
Badass
Trailer is amazing, but the editing they did to the theme is stupid and not at all scary anymore.
What a cheesy piece of trash this movie will be.
If Michael Myers was born in 1957, he’d be about 64 years old. How can he be so strong? Well, when you think about it, what else is there to do in captivity for 40 years other than lift weights?
Goddamn that trailer gives away a lot
This Michael looks more savage and scary than the others
HOLY FUCK……..
Micheal is crazy 😂😂👌🏽👌🏽
I T N E V E R   E N D S
This bout to slap
At 1:26 that is Julian and he's watching his parents get killed by Michael you even see their bodies with the Silver Shamrock masks on.
Hmm 🥱🥱
Laurie:evil dies tonight  Money: well yes but actually no
They should have stopped the trailer right after he takes that saw to the fireman, i think i just saw every kill scene already😒
This guy just never dies huh
But apparently here's the thing what if Michael myers son named Steven Lloyd comes back and ends up taking Michael myers place or if Halloween never ends because Michael myers could come back as a demon and he ends up possessing a little girl and doing it all over again
If she don’t kill him for good this time …
She could have easily shot him at the end of the last movie. It’s so stupid that she didn’t
We're going to be at 2050 and this man has yet to be gone.  Jamie Lee and her family going to be living on edge forever. DOES ANYONE HAS THE ANSWER?? lol.
Watch him survive at the end🙄
Can't wait to see it
Is this gene be on HBO max? Lol
geez...I will go to the theatre to watch it, I'm sure..but geez..it's gotten to trite..lol..
Other 🚮🚮💩🚮🚮 movie
Dead meat: this is exactly what I’ve been waiting for!
Wow show the whole movie during the trailer god DAMN.
Im so over this. Hes Never Gonna die that’s that 💀
This looks like a horrible idea.
I love watching Hollywood burn.
WTF!  The trailer showed all the killings, the plot, and unfolded the entire story!  Why bother seeing it now?
Should have given it to Rob Zombie!
Can't wait......
I hate to be that guy but Micheal has existed for 43yrs and his story is linear af, you already know how the movie ends, the sequels add 0 story. Just another big dude killing little dudes with 0 setbacks
Last week I seen street racers go into space. I hope this doesn't turn into something unrecognizable
Bruh they showed way to many kills who ever made this trailer should be fired and never get a job again
The cello Halloween theme better be in the soundtrack so I can add it to my Halloween trick or treat music
Oh my God he never dies does he 😂😂😂😑
I’m so excited!!!!!
If Annabelle don't come and get her man's 🥴
LOL the scene with the firefighters looks laughably bad
No no no this is fake he died in the fire
Looks good cant wait to see it in the cinema 😁
Making another one hell yeah
No no no this is fake he died
I feel like I just watched the whole movie :P still gonna watch it though. Huge fan. But, did we just see every  k i l l  in the movie? xD
But I am just wondering what about the only thing you forgot about is Michael myers son named Steven Lloyd and I am just wondering what if Michael myers seen his own son all grown up in his 20s
might be the best one yet-
At this point they just showed every single kill that’s going to happen in the movie all we gonna watch is how it plays out
Damn nows it's been 43 years,  if Lori don't kill this bitch 🤣
Even the devil himself doesn't want him in hell .. Devil: awh hell nah .. send him back they can make another Halloween movie 🎃
We would have went out together because I would have messed him up bad after running 🏃‍♀️ all those years
Yall should've been hunted his ass...
Should’ve carpet bombed the burning house and then napalmed it and then dropped a Nike on it. Ez pz
That song is fucking awesome
Halloween sequel: "This time, Michael dies."  Halloween sequel: "This time, Michael dies."  Another Halloween sequel: "This time, Michael dies.  Many decades later, another Halloween sequel: "This time, Michael dies."  Yeah, I'm just not buying it anymore.
Nobody is discussing the Silver Shamrock ☘️ Halloween Masks?! That's awesome! Halloween III was a great movie, I'm glad they finally made it cannon.
Soooo….hopefully this movie won’t be a killfest
Do those firefighters have anything against running away?
Everybody is gangsta until Michael reach *tier 3*   Thats a DBD meme.
How old is JC now and I’m not talking about Jamie Lee
I feel like they just showed me the whole movie but... I'm gonna see it regardless lol.
The BEST !!!!!
When you open a pack of gum in class and everyone wants some.
Michael Myers rampage Awesomeness😆✌️
im tired of these movies, its just beating a dead horse at this point. The second movie from the 80's was the finale to michael myers
Lol a grandma will never beat Micheal Myers 🤣🤣🤣
After 43 years we get to see micheal unmasked 😏🤭
Seems that Michael myers just refuses to die
Michael getting killed by a old lady come on micheal🤨
This man Michael Myers been through gunshots getting stabbed maybe even explosion and fire to the body and still alive tell me how is he not dead he is a immortal at this point
How in the hell is Micheal still alive?!?!?! Is he like a god or something?
DJ Khaled reacts: ANOTHER ONE!!!!
Why couldn’t they let him burn
Stop.Just stop.
Love the trailer! Been waiting for this movie since the previous one ended! I'm so excited, can't wait to watch it!
Wow
0:36-0:46 bro like how is that possible,there were at least 5 people in the scene
Micheal I love you but are you EVER gonna die bro?
I really hope the words “The more he kills the more he transcends” aren’t related to any magic storyline for this reboot 😞
This is shit lmao
This looks fuckin amazing
Here we go again....😴😴😴😴😴
*pulls out chainsaw*  Michael: “You’re not that guy pal trust me you’re not that guy”
I’m actually pretty hyped for this bruh they finally releasing something interesting in the movies last time there was something interesting I watched Gorilla vs Radioactive monster
Karen took my mask and i took that personally
funny, they still think they can kill him.
This is just stupid... His jumpsuit and mask now have magic powers. His jumpsuit didn't even get burnt... His mask didn't even melt. He's dead there is no way around that. I guess the more he kills the more his jumpsuit and mask transcended physics and reality.
H20 was the end of the series for me.
Why haven't they just brought out the military yet
I'm so excited for this movie!
anyone know what the music in the background is called?
Laurie: evil dies tonight  Me: bitch you still got Halloween ends next year watch ya talking about
I effing love Halloween! Can't wait
Michaels pisseddddd
That was a good movie.
The O.G. females with power :D hahaha im so pumped to see this movie tho i loved the 2019 to
Looks like the whole neighborhood was going after him this time
Laurie - "Evil dies tonight"   Michael- "First of all.....I'm fast as fuck boi!!"
Ohhhh, I’m in!
overdue!
Call Halloween a cow from all the milking
someone said “if she don’t get him this movie imma have to step in” 💀
how many fireman is dead bro it can't be serious, you guys have one job to kill this guy😬😔
Wow. Pretty much give away every single death scene!
Sometimes they show way too much of the movie in these trailers bro.  Sometimes it's better to keep it simple and short.  I watch horror movies for the kill scenes and they showed all the DAMN KILL SCENES bro WTF! 😡
The hype is at 1,000,000,000,000,000 for this one
He never dies and always comes back home
show way too much, stay away from this trailer/ if you care if not then have fun.
He might as well be immortal because he has been shot dozens of times, set on fire twice, thrown off a roof, fingers shot off, stabbed, shot in both eyes and has fallen down a hill...
Whole town: Michael dies tonight  Michael: Get a load of these fuking idiots
Not the same without Dr Loomis
With the left having a chockhold over the movie industry, I predict a group of random chicks takes him down. Lol
But it’s the psychiatrist doctor now. It’s not even Micheal Myers!
This movie looks amazing. I hope the fight scenes and killing scenes are one shot takes.
Really??? Micheal is still alive? No arthritis no skin disease no cancer huh? Just as healthy as he was in the 70's.
Of course the structure guys died. Now if it were the Wildland, it'd be different.
The Shape returns! My favorite villain!
We going to pretend the person at 1:27 isn't jiggling the car door handle in time with the beat of the music?
This movies comes out on oct 15 Me: oh my birthday is on oct 7
*Halloween day*  Michael: now this looks like a job for me
I love scary movies😎👍👍👍👍😍😜😝
I can’t wait
Michael is like 90 years old now lolol
Looks good but I definitely don't like the crappy rock synth music in place of the iconic theme tune. That's just plain dumb Universal Pictures.
Can't wait to see this
Aw shi here we go again
Most brutal mask ever!
Michael for Präsident
"Evil dies tonight: Michael: Am I a joke to you?
I was fittin to go watch this but I think I just did 😂
Eh..
I’m so hyped for this movie only 4 days after my b-day
He’s baaack
Why does everyone choose some up close and personal type weapon? Even the dude with the shotgun got like 2 feet from him.. jeez.. definitely a blockbuster rental
Yes finally
🔪🎃
I want danny devito as micheal myers
Too much detail for trailer. Less is more.
Literally he never fuckin dies 🤦🏻‍♀️  It’s not logical but these movies are everything!!
Wasn’t too sure on another Halloween movie after the last one but it actually looks good
Dang that was an awesome 2:30 minute movie!  Can’t wait for the NEXT sequel in a few years.
Pretty much the whole movie in 2 minutes 🤔
He's baaack
Nice nod to Halloween III: Season of the Witch.
he aint dying in this one neither
Looks awesome
Michael killed Mamie! Ashley Schaffer gonna bring the fury of the old south down on Michael!
Jamie Lee Curtis is ICONIC in these films. 💯
😲
Bro watch Michael drop all them people hunting him how many times does she say evil dies im killing him then fail michael finna destroy them
Ooooh I can’t wait!
getting rob zombie vibes with how violent he is.
NICE TRAILER. YOU CAN SEE ALL MOVIE KILLS :)
And after Halloween - Ends...HE...WILL BACK AGAIN!
I hope it's not what we saw in the trailer... Just a kill compilation with no plot or logic
Goal!
Who else remembered John wick after hearing boogeyman
Mike is a beast
Myers, Michael Myers.
"Evil dies tonight" Michael: OH NO,.. anyway
I can’t wait😭😭❤️
Oh my god...You serious? SIX MEN'S! SIX! AND THEY CAN'T KILL ONE OLD MAN!
did anyone notice that the skull the pumpkin and the witch mask . Halloween 3 silver shamrock mask look a like.
I love this movie I will rewatch the old ones again!!
They should literally let Mike Myers play him when they pull the mask off.
dude u just showed me the whole movie in a trailer
He gonna live even if the world endend. Well if the world enden only leaving him he would know how to kill himself because there's no one else to kill.🤔
Here everyone thought corona was bad until they met Michael Myers 🤣🤣🤣
You cannot kill what is immortal   -a person with a functioning brain
I'm so excited for this movie! 🎃🔪
I feel it so bad for those poor firefighters. All they wanted to do was put out a fire
Michael can kill Thanos with his bare hands.
Omg how i love micheal
I think I just saw the whole movie
Yesssss good ole Mike..
Noooo. Does not look good. Looks like the crappy Rob zombie remakes versus the Halloween movies I know and love. I’ll see it but no longer tense with anticipation.
Nunca muriº ._.xd
1:44
I met him, fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left. No reason, no conscience, no understanding; even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, good or evil, right or wrong. I met this six-year-old child, with this blind, pale, emotionless face and, the blackest eyes... the DEVIL'S eyes! I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up for I realized what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... EVIL!
Yeah, but those Silver Shamrock masks, tho... 0_0
The music at 2:11 is so intense
The way he kills those firemen, sheesh that's brutal
He’s gonna kill the entire town. Explain what this mf is made of n how he does all this. No way in hell some 60 year old dude is just going around taking out a whole fire department by himself.  I’m rooting for the town to win. They’ll scrape by and survive long enough for him to do another murder spree again tho.
FINALLY!!!!!!
2:23 I’m not sure who’s more evil, Michael or her.
Oh my gosh this looks so good 🙌🏽🙌🏽
This is a mockery of what actually would happen in the US. The dude in the halloween mask gets shot with an AR 15 first day out, by cop and citizen alike.
the amount of times this series has said evil dies tonight when michael just gets right back up lmao, curious to see where they take this one tho
Y’all I like how in every horror movie they never jump the serial killer
Sorry jack mikeys back
Mike just wanted Halloween few more days😳
So I am a huge fan of the original Halloween’s by John and adore the remakes by rob zombie even more so as you can imagine a few years ago when a new Halloween came out I was beyond excited. However I feel like they took away from the horror aspect and the monster aspect of Michael and made him more of a villain and reminded me more of some sort of action dooms day movie
The fact its continuing on the same night.. fun.. cant wait for part 3.. myers walking out fire like undertaker
I see they gave us some Easter eggs… anyone recognized the Halloween Season of The Witch masks? 😎
What is this Mickey Mouse shit?
This one actually looks better then the last one, let's hope
I hope Michael Myers gets an invitation in smash he’ll be the best character
I wanted to post this on Trump speaking on the border wall all the while he's about to go down like all capone and the secret   service gonna run a underground railroad on melania
Holloween 2021... Michael Myers is attacked by feminists that repeatedly yell about his male privilege. Then he gets surrounded by BLM who proceed to judge him on his skin color and ban him from their event. As he runs from these morality superior people, he bumps into an antifa riot where they begin to punch him repeatedly in the face because they believe he’s a Trump supporter. Welcome to your nightmare mike! 😆
The evil never gonna die...
Best part of the trailer was the shoutout to the Silver Shamrock masks from the only Halloween movie without Myers (and the best one IMO)!
I can’t wait to see this movie 🍿
I love how the studios and creators and fans have all just accepted that if he wants you dead, there is no stopping him, and that pretty much anyone that shows up in a trailer is 95% likely to be killed, so they’re just like “alright, here’s the plot, here’s some fresh meat, we know micheal is gonna do what he does best, sit back and enjoy”
If y’all don’t know what transcends mean well I google it for you and it’s means :transitive verb. 1a : to rise above or go beyond the limits of. b : to triumph over the negative or restrictive aspects of : overcome. c : to be prior to, beyond, and above (the universe or material existence)
when i see jamie lee curtis, i watch. she still fine.
I regret watching the trailer. They show too much of the good stuff. But I just couldn't resist it's Halloween we are talking about here.
Ancioso por ver  Halloween adoro🙏🙏🙏🙏
So your telling me the firefighters just stood there waiting to be killed. They had all this equipment that could be used for weapons and didn’t use any?? But again using weapons agaisnt Micheal prob won’t work chance of death is high
FUKKKYESS!!!
This better the the last time I see you michal
Just make good movies with some sense  Otherwise don't dole out this bullshit , I don't have time for your nonsense
Whatever happened to movies trailers when they would show a min worth of the trailer and not the entire movie? LOL
🙀
Omg run 🏃‍♀️
Now I’m HYPED! 🎃🔪🍁
Just end the franchise and start a new project, Halloween has been played out for years
I love the concept that the characters try to hunt down the killer instead of running away and eventually defeat him by luck. So its a combination of creepy, but also fun because you have main characters you root for.
Shame this had to be about Feminism. :(
This died a long time ago
I thought this nigga died fr this time😂😂😂😂😂😂
💪🏻🤯
Let's not lie here the last films have been terrible loool like actually terrible like 70 mins long build for half half then its over
💪🏻
Not sure how I feel about ANOTHER movie, But as a Halloween fan, I have to watch it by principal 😩
Freddy: how the hell you made It out of the fire?..thats my job !  Michael:  ...when are you going To wake up dumb*ss, O and here  Is your neosporin back 🤣💀
Laurie: "Evil dies tonight"  Micheal: "but I'm a slasher horror character dude"
So when would Myers die?
I like how they added the masks from Halloween 3
AINT NO WAY 😭
Yes now they finally got halloween kills figured out
Even though we’ve seen slasher killers that kill you in your dreams, rise from the dead, or show you your worst fears—Michael Myers is only a man, and somehow that makes him all the more terrifying. *why won’t he die?*
I stopped watching the series years ago. But since Jamie Lee Curtis is going to be in this one I will definitely be watching it
This looks dumb af, but I'm still going to watch it.
The firefighters could’ve shot him with those water hoses 😂😂
I’m excited but like….can they stop showing the entireeeeee movie in a trailer.
1:32 silver shamrock masks reference to (halloween lll) season of the witch (1982)
Dr. Ryan should have called Gibbs right away, one steely glare and Michael's done...
hhmmm a 5.7, not more, maybe less.
I love this movie, but lets get real. Why michael myers is f*ck*n strong! I mean he simply human!
Sure the 31st of October us the night for all of the spooky monsters, and creatures. But we all know that Halloween belongs to Michael!
They showed way too much in this trailer
Not directed by John Carpenter
Boy Michael came off the porch like this finna be a blast!
Highest kill count on Dead Meat kill count..
Laurie: Evil dies tonight Michael: All I wanted was my mask
I hope that's as far as they take Michaels badassery he is still human and he took on multiple firemen who should have been able to handle Michael
HALLOWEEN SUCKS
we still need a michael vs jason..
“Evil dies tonight!”  Sounds like something Dr loomis would say
Myers walking out the flaming house is badass!! 🎃🔥
I hope he doesn’t die
I typed on google if halloween ends will be the last halloween movie? Answer: Halloween Ends Reportedly Won't Be The Last Halloween Movie
im sooo ready to this movie <3
Why do still keep trying to kill him with a little gun?
I am Michael.😂😂😂😂😂
Hopefully it shows him eating something from say a fridge after he kills the people living there. Must be a bit tough to do that wearing the mask, though.
They just showed the whole movie.🤝
First movie where I seen the fire department try to kill somebody not save them!
Another movie about how America was after they took the land from us lmao.
Next up, The Resurrection of Michael Myers. Sorry Laurie, you tried.
Poor Nurse Marion Chambers looks like she dies AGAIN!
So stupid
Halloween:Infinity Michael Myers kills thanos (huh?) and the avengers (gasp!) takes all of the infinity stones and puts them in an ordinary kitchen knife. Now the surviving victims must band together to stop Michael Myers who now wields the infinity knife! (Ahhhh)
Absolutely can not wait to watch this!!!
The trailer shows tooooo much..  it's the whole film..
The strings remake of the Halloween theme is SO GOOD
They really butchered the Halloween movies, Michael Myers style.
Wow this looks amazing
For those who haven’t noticed, we got three characters from the original film returning in this one! The nurse who worked with Dr Loomis and the two kids Laurie babysat, Tommy and Lindsey!
Evil dies tonight...   Michael:  you..ova theeya hold my knife and dont move i gotta make anotha believa   Michael: kids this youra diabolical killing uncle ...(from Boston) remember to check ya candies🤣🤣🤣
Evil dies tonight  Michael : and I took that personally
maybe in this one they sit and have a cup of tea
maybe in this one they stand up against mm
maybe in this one they finally get him into therapy
This is going be a great popcorn flick for sure. Just sheer entertainment
Can't be any worse than the last one
Mike been killing it since the 70s
1:33 Season of the witch 2 confirmed
Ok I’m stopping halfway through this. I’m going to see it when it comes out; I don’t need to see most of it right now.
Well of course the fire department is gonna come lady, what did you expect?
Anyone else watching this for the 1,000th time? Or just me?
Its not knife it is injection I think so.
1:32 Halloween 3 reference
Hey, while youre at it.. Kill covid too. Both seem impossible. 😂
In the next one Jamie Lee Curtis will have a wheelchair... I like these movies, but c'mon the Story is as dead as it could be. Franchise and money making, that's all.
- I expect a lot of action scenes, a lot of terror, a lot of deaths, little talk, little drama, short but entertaining movie. Then you can fight Jason Friday the 13th or the villain Leatherface from the movie Texas Chainsaw Massacre. new movies.
👀
ooooooo
Movie never made a lick of damn sense to me… that being said, dope trailer.
Garbage
Now why would I watch this. Spoiler alert: Michael lives, killing almost everyone in this movie
It’s the fact that after all these years, they still haven’t managed to kill him yet 💀 it’s crazy
I just saw the entire movie in 2: 30 minute trailer!
take note !!!  the 3 masks from halloween 3 season of the witchs as a reference!! in one scene
“Next Halloween. When the sun sets. And someone is alone…he kills”
Then Halloween kills part 2, part 3, never ends. Jamie Lee looks horrible. Yuk.
I hate to say it...but this doesn't look good...at all.  An entire neighborhood has teamed up against him.  Dumb.
Boooooooooooooo can’t this series just be over?
laurie: evil dies tonight  michael: hehe NO boy

Laurie: “evil dies tonight”   Michael: “...anyway I started stabbin the mf”
Ok, so not a Halloween fan. entertaining movies, for sure. haven't seen them all because I've seen some. but this actually looks good to me!!
Laurie:Evil dies tonight Director : Yes! But actually no! We still need to shoot Halloween Ends ...
Victims - all life's matter Michael - hold my beer
Michael takin all the smoke
Mike terrorizin mfers since the 70s yo
Damn... Are they gonna save any kills for the movie? They showed us like ten in this trailer...
Milking a dead cow 🐄 moooooooo
DAMN🔥
"Michael Myers is alive." Me in the theater yelling: DAMN STRAIGHT HE IS!
I CAN’T WAIT!!!!!
Pathetic, I guess anything for a quick buck.
I've seen every Halloween a million times if I can keep up with the entire back story why can't they ? Jamie lee Curtis was Jamie's mother from 4 and 5 John's mother from h20 and died in the beginning of the 8th wtf is up I love the Halloweens but why keep switching every detail of the story til thr now is no story ?!
Looks good but you know.......they can fuck up bacon.
1:57 anyone see that old man jogging?
I’m looking for a follow up to part 3!!
The little boy that used to cut up his rats are now cutting peoples throats and causing house fires😈🔥
I’m excited but not sure how I’ll feel if they add a supernatural twist to it….I get it these iconic killers are immortal but please no lol not for these new ones. You can do a Michael Myers in space when I’m dead please. XD
Something news are waiting us
He’s been dead for 4 decades and he’ll be dead another 4 decades.
is that part 2
Oh great more fuel for people to become freaky murderers.
Thus actually looks good
Hmm 🤔, so they taking a slight supernatural road like Jason Vorhees  did, Imagine that  The originator imitating the imitator  I’m game ✅
damn i can't wait
And The next sequel after this… we’re stepping it up.. You know how some movies talk to the 4th wall?? Well michael is gonna stab the 4th wall!! 🤯🤯💀
Everyone: How the hell did Micheal survive that!? Me: It's because of The power of Halloween Fans and Immortality
Wow i did not see that 1 coming i thought this was fake but i guess ill be in the theaters when this comes out...
Hardd
You want your mask, then take it!  Take it, Mikey, Take it! Take IT!  *Turns into clown and starts biting off Michael's hand.
Ha! knew he'd escape through that hole she blew into the floor!
Most people forgot but Michael is really pissed at Karen for tricking him lol.  That is his whole motivation now.
Halloween Infinity War
Looks good! Next is Michael vs Jason
Whenever you're running scare while shitting your pants, Michael Myers always 'walks' faster than you 😂
Anyone else a big fan of Halloween but annoyed by the fact of a “flesh and blood” human surviving so much bs? I mean come on.. Michael has literally been shot like 1,000,000,000,000 times, burned, ran over by cars, etc. I’m a hard critic on sense of reality when it comes to movies and most horror films are senseless.
Showed tooo much! Unless there is another 10 kills in the film this trailer may well have ruined it
Have anyone notice that beginning of the trailer, her hands was covered in blood while holding a knife, while the ending of Halloween 2018 her hands wasn't covered in blood? Why is that?
I want to download the trailer theme just for that GRITTY VIOLIN RIFF
So micheal myers is basically murder jesus at this point?   Also nice nod to season of the witch with the masks
I hope the movie is sooo much more than the script I read
Michael Myers strikes again!
This trailer should show how everyone in the movie dies so I don’t have to go see it… Oh wait.
Laurie: Evil dies tonight‼️   Michael: bitch you said that in the last movie 🔪
We already witnessed at least 10 deaths already an it is awesome
Micheal walking out of the house with this badass theme is just fucking awesome. The shots and pacing were incredible
I don’t care what y’all say, rob zombie made good Halloween movies. The second maybe isn’t great, but it’s different and different is okay, since we have literally about a dozen films of the same old same old. Plus that ending with love hurts by nan Vernon, super memorable
cant wait to see michael myers!!!
Yayyyyy i fuckin love youuu John carpenter
Sheeeesh
this looks fucking amazing
Nope.
instead of making remakes of old movies try making something new... no just no
at this point why doesn’t the military get involved smh
Michael myers did really special kills here I wonder what kill that is the golden chainsaw in the kill count
Plot Twist: Lisa Rinna is secretly Michael Myers.
I swear every halloween movie is just a “how many times do we hafta teach you this lesson old man”
If the ending is as bad as it ch 2 I'm going to be mad
Ahhhhh i’m not even gonna finish the trailer because they’re giving out so much already I can’t wait 🖤🧡🖤🧡🖤🧡
Any horror movie, You’ll never hear a brotha or a sista say “hey I heard a noise, let’s go check it out” we don’t play those games 😂😂
Caça níquel,  halloween acabou no H20 o resto é conversa fiada
Okay now collab with cod so we can have another Michael Myers appearance in cod
I think it's time Haddonfield should hire John wick to hunt down Michael Myers😌😌  Edit- or maybe Jason Bourne 🤔🤔
My family tried to say Mike was dead, oh hoho how wrong they were and how right i was
As much as I’m sick of all the sequels of these movies, this surprisingly looks good. I’ll be going to see this in the theaters.   And I only say I’m sick of it because these classic movies get milked with sequels that are never nearly as good as the original. I’d rather new ideas and movies come out, but it seems Hollywood only has a new great idea and makes a good movie out of it at best once a year but usually longer than that. (And I’m talking of all genres combined.)
I cant stop watching this, it looks really good
If Mike Myers was "flesh and blood" then he'd been dead in 1984! Starting to think...maybe he's not human 🤔
🔥
Can’t wait!!
Wonder if they ever going to stop showing the entire movie in trailers
Hope it doesnt suck. The 5+ fireman squad dying by one dude really makes me worried though
I want to see this movie. I love the Halloween movies. But this trailer had a lot of spoilers by showing the kills. Movie trailers need to show less and let the audience be surprised.
I miss when horror movies didn't have to explain their self
Jamie lee curtis is a great actor y’all don’t understand when it comes to her in this franchise
🙄 Idk what's more annoying. Them constantly remaking this damn movie or me always taking my ass to see every one that comes out. 🤦🏾‍♀️
showed wayyy too much
It’s the “Let it BURN!” for me 😭😭🤣
Ok it gets old after while!!🤷🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Another action movie
Laurie: evil dies tonight  Michael: stares off into the office cameras
So they can churn out Halloween movies lately at a lightning pace but they cant bring us another Friday the 13th. what the faaaaaaaak. Is it Paramonts fault? New Line? Why have we not gotten another movie?!
70 year old jaime lee curtis is comming for michael, sounds like a granny squirt video
my opinion but i will trade the entire nightmare on elm street movies to see micheal vs jason my opinion or micheal vs jason vs freddy
I feel like I don’t even need to see it now. They’ve basically shown me the whole movie lol
Oh did he not die bruh
Oh, really another one..................................
Yass!!! 😍🔥💪🏻💯
Is this official.trailer??
Why show all these kills in the trailer? Lol
Micheal at this point is a Demi god
Thanks trailer, I've now nearly seen the entire movie
Michael can't die. Michael won't die. Nobody can kill Michael. Michael isn't human. Michael is robot.
It’s funny cause you thought you killed him and you didn’t and you think you’ll kill him now, but you won’t cause there’s a third one already in the works
The best part for me in this trailer is that when fighter fighters see Micheal they go like using axe and saw and actually fight back against Michael not just running away and you can kinda see what type of movie this is going to be.
Literal chills. I love Jaime Lee Curtis
Hell yeah I watching it ❤️❤️❤️❤️
This movie is about to be badass!! can’t wait
Much as I love Michael, I hope he takes *some* wounds from an entire group of firemen armed with axes, saws and who knows what else....  Those men aren't weak cultists like the last slaughter he did....
Evil dies tonight ❤❤❤
"Evil dies tonight" gives off the same energy as "It ends tonight" from batman
Micheal Myers is the real John Wick...
Recorded footage of me terrorizing the lobby when I come back from the gulag in Warzone after dying to some BS.
How you think this will end? Will he die or no. I'm guessing no he won't die simply cause they underestimate him.  His sister thinks she can kill him which will be her down fall cause she tried so many times but failed.
Favorite horror movies of all time!! Can’t wait for this!
🎃
Anyone else just wanna see michal Myers vs Jason vorhees fight and have it be like a 2-3 hour movie and at least an 1hr of action with them
Just as Halloween was a callback to the original, this one seems like Halloween 2. Except less hospital.
Way too much was shown in the trailer.. like every death..
It’s very unwise in this franchise to tease Micheal he will get you
Ok. Just don't fck up the theme music. It's literally perfect as it is!
LUARIE YASSS
He would love to hang out with John Wick and the guy from Nobody.
Jesus CCchrrist?!! This guys kill counter is still tickin away huh!!? Aaaaaand they said the mask design is a mold of William Shatner’s face, so ever since I saw that, I think about it every time I see this guy lololol & LET ME TELL YOU!?? - I STILL don’t see the likeness !!?
Find it really interesting how they have the refence to the Halloween movie that didn't have Micheal with the mask of his victims halloween 3
evil never dies...
Should have let Rob Zombie direct it. His were the best.
I want to see some special forces take on michael myers😂
The people of Haaddenfeild are through being terrified of Michael and are ready to fight back
I think that fire really pissed him off!
Please let this be the end of the Halloween series it’s getting old at this point
Another Halloween movie when they go end lol
This man made a knife the deadliest weapon on earth😭💯
I can't wait to see this
Michael Myers from CHICAGO
Bruh…..move to Europe. Done
how tf you supposed to kill this nigga ??!
Not usually  proponent of guns, but seems unlikely that nobody would have tried gunning him down with an AR15 by now
Can't wait for James to say, "Let's get to the kills, literally."
The whole town is after Michael😱 finna be lit this coming October. Imagine the amount gore we’re going to get.
Oh wait. You all just bitch about everything cause that’s all you know how to do
Is no one gonna mention the masks the dead kids are wearing?
It's not the fact that he walks and catches up to you even when you run, but the fact that he never stops walking and everybody else eventually stops running...
Me: So what if 'The Entity' from Dead By Daylight is canon within the Halloween series? Universal: *Write that down, WRITE THAT DOWN!*
So i can run across the Earth and hide on Mt. Everest but Michael with always find you by walking😂
😍 my favourite horror villain back in business
Dis is really better
I thought that was joe biden
Plot twist: he doesn't die
I can't wait. This looks so awesome and pretty violent too. 🎃🔪💀
Does anyone else feel like they should a bit too much in this trailer ?
I'm a big time horror film fan but so I'm so hyped for this. I can't wait
Pretty sure they just showed every killing scene ...
They’ve gone so far away from what made Halloween scary that it’s amazing
Just show the entire movie in the trailer smart idea
Why didn’t Laurie just move to Hawaii or Bora Bora.  Pretty sure MM couldn’t book an airline ticket
[Beginning of trailer]  Laurie, Karen, Allyson: "NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!"  [End of trailer] Me: "Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!"
Laurie should've watched the Film Theory episode on how to kill Michael Myers
Cut it out man. You have been milking millions now with this stupidity. Sequel after sequels..end of the film...show him half dead...bam another sequel. Movies have a limit.
I’m so disappointed in myself for not expecting this, like he ALWAYS comes back 🤦‍♀️
And here they make another one for Michael but not JASON WTF MAN! Where’s Friday the 13th or another nightmare on elm street!
I want Michael to win tbh
As a firefighter myself, that first scene hurt deep.
Can’t wait for this!! 🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃
theyre giving away all the kills
yes finally     subzero attacks again
The more he kills the more he transcends thats prolly his power
A real gorefest!
Yessss
This is the disturbing blood bath that I needed in my life
What is this like # 14.
Just use DS
All we know is that when this movie comes out dead meat and daddyphatsnaps gonna be all over it.
HE CANT DIE
This looks sick
oh they’re making another one nice
Michael Myers is like 70 how much longer can he keep it up
Michael's death must be legendary. Anything less is disgraceful
I heard this movie is going to break the record for most kills in a horror movie, you know what that means 🍿🍿👀
https://youtu.be/BtFN7SHjSIA
i think slashers belong in the 90s.
How come the FBI or the military hasn't show up to get Michael 🤔
Is that Joe Biden as the thumbnail?
This look good af
Michael is the only guy who can bring a 🔪 into a 🔫 fight and still win handily 😂🤣😭😆
Laurie: “Evil dies tonight” Universal Pictures: “Does it have to though?”
Did those fire fighters just stand there like the z fighters?
Wow, they really went rob zombie on this one huh
Bruh they showed half of the movie in this trailer.👎👎👎
THIS IS AMAZING I CAN’T WAIT
FUCK YAAAAA  Bitch the more he kills the more he transcends da fuck
Yessir cant wait been a fan since day one especially the rob zombie version stupid 🔥🔥🔥
Dam another one ?
Michael Myers mask is Captain Kirk (William Shatner)
Looks nice, interesting premise.
That part where he come out of the burning house he looks like the devil coming out of hell. Such a erie feeling!
Still can’t believe Michel didn’t join the basketball team
wow
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE MICHAELS CHILDHOOD HOME AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It looks whatever but like I’m still gonna see it
So what is really Michael is he a demon or mutant thing dat can’t die I need answers.
It’s like the newer Halloween was part 1 and this is the beginning of all the cruddy sequels.
Man they really got spoil all these kills in the trailer.
Im gonna be honest, this doesn’t look as good as the last one.
Does somebody want to tell Michael that Halloween is over when it hits midnight?
Laurie: Evil dies tonight Michael: So, anyway, I started stabbing
Holy Moly
Garbage! It was cool 30 years ago, but now it's played out
Another trailer which spoils the whole movie. Great job universal.
Has anyone tried giving him a joint maybe that’s all he needs
Oh shit here we go again
See, I’ve been telling these devs that tier 3 is OP
Time for that Mike vs Jason for real.
Michael - BRING THE TRUCKS, YES!😁
“I met him fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left. No reason, no, uh, conscience, no understanding and even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this six year old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and the blackest eyes, the devil’s eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him and then another seven trying to keep him locked up because I realized that what was living behind that boy’s eyes was purely and simply evil…”Dr. Samuel Loomis.
1:46 to 1:48 is from the 1978 flashback I bet. Looks very Dean Cundey-esque.
This looks terrible.
After that last pile of garbage movie?
tonight or that  night?
Another one? Seriously? How many are there now?
The man just won't die!!!!!!
S2.
HAPPY HAPPY HALLOWEEN, SILVER SHAMROCK!
how did he survive a gun shot, a car crash and a fire. DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
They're gonna make the next 5 Halloween movies with the same exact plot and I think it's hilarious lol "Michael's still alive, we need to kill him, again!" 😂
sounds "gay" but looks good ;)
Looks good,hope this is the last one forever
Unless i see his head squished like a damn pumpkin i will not believe he is dead
DO NOT READ THIS IF U DONT WANT SPOILERS. I HAVE READ THE SCRIPT. LINDSEY, ALLYSON AND LAURIE ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO WILL BE SURVIVING.. KAREN ALMOST ALIVE BUT KILLED ON THE LAST PART. HALLOWEEN ENDS WILL CENTER ON LAURIE AND MICHAEL FINAL FIGHT.   HALLOWEEN KILLS ENDS UP ON LAURIE CALLING KAREN BUT MICHAEL IS THE ONE WHO ANSWERS IT.    CAMERON IS THE ONE WHO WILL GET THE MOST BRUTAL DEATH.
Halloween: Anotha one! DJ Khaled: Hey that's my line!
Wait is this a new Halloween movie?😀😀😀😀😀😀
Can someone tell me what this is?
I on Michaels side.
Yes
Nice, looks like a solid 3/10 like the 50 other films
I think they’ve lost the plot
Thanks for the showing of the movie ..it's alright seems like there making him to much like Jason idk
Ill kick ass fast and easy people are so fucking stupid. I know the beginning and end of this crap. 20 plus yrs of the same shit over and over again. Not wasting my time and money.
My ass it dies tonight they just gonna make another movie n milk it like Fast n the Furious cus universal has no more good ideas for movies anymore
Would hate to see him “die”
Damn she still running from mike it aint enough activia in the world ......
Interesting, I'm all for this.
Now that's a lot of damage
No Halloween movie will ever top Rob Zombie's Part 1.  That lead up from Michael's childhood was a masterpiece.
This is gonna be epic whatever people think you won't really know if it's good unless yall see it
gave away the whole ass movie
mortal kombat
I grew with Halloween movies and Michael Myers is my favorite character in the horror genre. I don't care if this will be a trash movie, I will watch it anyways
Part of me is excited but another part of me is hating this because Michael Myers is regularly the hunter but in this new film and the previous film, he’s the hunted. It kinda takes away from the horror aspect of the film.
Thanks for giving away half the plot
They showed us wayy too much tbh
"                   ".
"he can't hurt anyone again"  Michael: welcome to the show
These movies always get better and better ! Love the adrenaline.
Been killing since 1963😁
“Evil dies tonight” Halloween Ends 2022- Hmmmmmmmm…..
Well, they showed us everything so we don’t have to go see it.
Why can't franchises like these just be left alone?
What happen to her son" josh hartnett???"
Directors: We've ran out ideas for movies Directors: Let's just bring Michael Myers for another movie Directors:after tht hv him go to Crystal Lake and fight Jason 😂😭🤣
I hope it’s gorier
god damm you've got to love that halloween tune
Me: I like how Halloween 2018 and now Halloween Kills (2021) are basically the original two movies again but still sequels~  Also me: It was *pure evil* waiting for this~~
Ahhh I can’t wait!!!!! 🔪🔪🔪
And then 25 movies later
Michael is like a Timex watch.. "It takes a licking and keeps on ticking." how many times has this dude died already?
I’m so unfazed by violence but the way Michael Myers kills people is so gut wrenching and disturbing he doesn’t quickly kill people he makes them suffer
“michael myers is dead he can’t hurt you”  michael myers: allow me to reintroduce myself🔪
Fred : Now, let’s see what sick son of bitch is really under this Michael Myers mask.  *Rips off mask*  Mystery Inc. : Old man Jenkins !!?  Old Man Jenkins : I would’ve gotten away with it too, if it weren’t for you meddling fucks, and that stupid ass dog.
IM TOOO EXCITED
Omg Really?.....      Only in Hollywood 🙄
Bring the Doom Slayer or Ash Williams that should do the job
This looks sick
He is a bad man...lol...JLC is is tuff too..
They an't  never going kill becuz they gonig  still keep doing  the same shit
Looks like mikeys turning kinda supernatural again 😍
this trailer spoiled half of the fucking movie
Why couldn't  Busta Rhymes have met this version of Michael ?!!!!.
🎃🔪
This fool will never die
**Heavy breathing**
Ok so I’ve been a fan of Michael Myers for the longest time and I just saw this and I freaked out
This series is going keep going till 3020
I can't wait
I still watching the trailer and looking at it like Laurie strode and Micheal Myers are still siblings
Laurie I thought u handled it!!!!
Can’t wait 2 see this and on the kill count
Who still think Rob zombie’s was the best yet? 🤔
We dont need anymore of these fckng movies the last one sucked this one will do no justice either
“Oh boy, here I go killing again.” — Michael Meyers
Remember me when the Halloween end trailer is released
They are showing way to much in these trailers anymore. The trailer for Halloween 2018 ruined some key scenes in the movie because you knew what was coming ie: closet scene.
So u telling me an old lady is about to kill this man?
I can see why they're calling it Halloween Kills...jeesh 🔪🎃
The Theme Song of Myers is insane I love it.
Well thanks for showing the deaths of important characters before the movie has come out, now I dont have to give you my money:)
'Hey jerk,..Halloween kiiiiiiills!'
Looks great…👌
He s a one man army
Micheal myers is an absolute force of nature.
I can't wait 😈
If i was that firefighter i would shit my pants
Love the Halloween 3 Easter eggs.
FINALLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Ready for this new one
Wow. He isn’t social distancing but he is wearing a mask so if it’s okay
I wonder how many people catch the subliminals and coding in this. I guess they'll find out soon.....
Actually looks 🔥
Sorry, but this looks like crap.
Michael Myers gives Freddy Krueger nightmares
NO FUCKING WAY IM SO EXCITED BYE BYE BYE
They just gave away all the good scenes. We just watched the entire movie. I hate when they do that.
Jamie Lee Curtis is awesome! Always gotta have that chainsaw revving in the trailer lol.
Lame
"Evil dies tonight" Michael: Who said dat? Who said that?.. Who said that? **insert RHOA meme here**
ITS ABOUT DAMN TIME THEY MADE MICHAEL GO NUCLEAR
James A Janiesse is gonna have a feild day with this one
I will never get tired of these movies!
Yes I wanted to see Michel go on a spree sooner or later
It’s the masks from Halloween III for me. 😩
I like how the mask is completely unmelted after being inside a blazing inferno
I saw this trailer like two years ago
Finally
james a janisse is gonna fucking love this
This is crazy I had a good feeling that it was gonna be another one he was just standing there like this 🔥 ant shit can't wait
Has anyone seen the bizzare face  looking up fron the burning basement. ?????? WTF.
It’s seems Michael hits tier 3 in this movie and brought a mori with tuff of hair
Vamos Michell mayersss 🦊
ya'll are not serious about seeing this right? Like,,,, im tiredt
LOOK TRASH !!!!!!! ....... AGAIN 😑
Hey new micheal reeves movie nice
No way this guy hasn’t died yet
I'm impressed with how burn resistant that mask is
I mean we know Michael is gonna kill a lot of people but dang it looks like they gave away a lot of scenes here🤣
Holy shit
Well thanks for showing me the basically the entire movie , lol. Think I just wait until Redbox  I don’t understand why studios release this much info on a film that so many people want to see makes no sense
HALLOWEEN HAS GONE ALL WOKE !!!! ROB ZOMBIE BROUGHT IT BACK TO LIFE. THE ONES AFTER ALL LICK AND ARE ALL WOKE. DONT WATCH THEM YOU WILL BE PISSED
i mean i guess
I love David Gordon Green so much. I'd watch a schlock MCU movie or Star Wars movie from that man. Give him the keys to the castle.
Entire Town: KILL HIM   Michael: ToggleGodMode
If she don’t kill him this season imma step in
Let’s goooo
Yooo this shit fire
Jaimee Lee Curtis continues to age terribly.  Dag
Halloween 🎃🎃🎃 My Fav🤗
So, if he killed 67 people in the trailer, the actual movie body count will be... 6892? He will have killed more people than Dr. Fauci
They legit showed everything in this trailer
Another one…? Do people still find this entertaining?
I can't wait I'm totally here for this movie
I just wish that they didnt put so much kills in the movie  save the fun for the movie!
Bro, Michael Myers and fast and the furious are Fossho in competition.. this dude Michael been murking people since 1978 this man gotta die🤣🤣
He came back to get revenge
I hope Michael is Biracial it’s 2k21
How many times is he coming back-
Jesus Christ, give this a freakin rest.
Nah I would just move to the uk tf is he going to do take a plane.
Giving me more of that rob zombie vibes with these kills
This actually looks like a fun continuation of the 2018 movie. Also who doesn't want more Jamie Lee Curtis
MY COUSIN JLC IS SUPER GRANNY NOW!!😆🥰🌟
The knife from kitchen
Am I the only one who wants Micheal to survive?
🤯
Glad she took her covid jab before setting back out to hunt Michael ✌🏻
Stupid
I hate trailers, they pretty much spoil the whole movie.
I'm excited ngl
Oh, so John Wick Halloween edition!
I am SO fucking stoked for this!
How the fuck did he not die wait he’s deadpool but scary and don’t talk
Yes yes can’t wait to shit my brix again wondering how he did not die in the fire I thought that would be it but no how many times is he going to die this guy got god mode or something but can’t wait for the kills especially the dead meat on YouTube sub to him he dose kill counts can’t wait till he dose that movie well that’s all I have to say 🔪🎃🎃 can’t wait

How is Jamie lee Curtis still alive
Damn. Dude gives 0 fucks. This kinda looks like it’s shaping up to be one of those corny whole town against one villain kinda thing.
So is he human or not??? How he survived death so many times
Okay but why they showing most of the kills though!!!
This time, he has an axe
I really really hope that nothing gets censored, this movie deserves to be as violent as it can be.
Didn't site decapitate him in last movie
This movie is gonna be sickkkkk🔥🔥🔥
Yes
Fast and Furious, Purge and now Halloween are in competition for longest series
That new Halloween theme hits different
Oh no, not another one
Lets go
Don’t need to watch it now.  We’ve seen all the deaths
I’m glad we aren’t wasting time with people not believing he’s back!  The OG’s and the rest of the town are ready!🔪🔥😍
they literally spoiled all the good scenes in the trailer...
wow i might as well have watched the whole movie in this video 🙄 what happened to leaving things for watching in the movie?? so ridiculous.
Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees 👀
WHEN COPS CAN'T KILLS ONE MAN   ..movie arrghh
Ohhhh lord they den took his mask
When
In real life the FBI, US Marshals, National Guard, State Police, Local Police and every other manner of law enforcement would be launching a massive man hunt to capture Michael using all types of high tech equipment and brute force.  But because it's a movie, no other body of law enforcement cares.
Yess!!!  I'm so ready 4 this💗
I like the cello playing the theme song
L
Now this is the sequel I’ve been waiting for 😤
I think this is going to be "the Empire strikes back" for Halloween
He killed like 20 people in this trailer so yeah I wouldn't get in his way.
Let's hunt him down  Michael: Girl, bye. *music plays*
I wanna see this now after I saw the 2018
Shoutout to these trailers that tend to show damn near the whole movie
Micheal Myers is a thanos of horror franchise
So we good if Laurie dies in this film and then the last one, Michael dies... YEAH?! Alright good we on the same page
im starting to wonder who would win in a fight... rob zombie michael or this fucking guy
You know he doesn't die in this Film because their already talking about Another Film past this one
I feel like at 2:22 Michaels just going to get jumped
My dad passed away on Halloween 2020 our favorite movies were all the Halloween movies like Michael Myers and what not. He got to see the 2018 Halloween but unfortunately not this one. I can’t wait to see it. 10.31.2020
I cant wait until october 🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃
Most violent micheal myers movie of all time
They should have named this film: Halloween Michaels Rage, because he is RAGING in this one lol.
Y'all notice that a firefighter tried killing Michael with a circular saw?
Apart from showing us almost the entire film, looks great!
Can't wait to see this
I have to fucking wait? I WANT IT NOW
Oh shit Daddy Myers is mad mad!🥴👀
Thanks J. L. Curtis for doing this. A Halloween movie without J. L. C. is like: ???
1:33 - 1:53 these 20 seconds gives me goosebumps
Shot, stabbed, burned, ran over..    His sister- Micheals only flesh and blood 🤣🤣🤣
I have to admit I like Michael Myers character development here on 2018 and this
“A man couldn’t survive that fire”  *Èowyn removes her mask*
Dang he killed the little cursing black boy looks like from the 2018 version . Spoiler alert
I feel like this is gonna graze the NC-17 rating.
how do you actually kill Michael... ?
Whilst I'm kind of done with the Halloween Franchise, this Trailer does get me a bit excited for October. I think it's a shame that they're showing a lot of the kills in the Trailer. They should save it for when you see the movie, that's part of the fun getting the shock and awe when seeing a slasher film. I feel this one will end on a big cliffhanger as there is another one scheduled to come out after. Hopefully that'll be the last one. It'll be interesting and satisfying if they bring it full circle back to the 1978 Original Classic with all of his victims pointing a straight line to his childhood home. Anyway Universal Studios has got me keen to see these next two installments.
Mike Glennon
Der muss doch langsam zu alt sein für den Scheiss😛
Yall don't understand what thisan has put me through as a child, I'm so scared bruh😅😅
Damn! This looks GOOD!
lol?
Tommy dies
It coming home, footballs coming home, sorry wrong video
Why the HECK are they showing all the kills in the trailer?!?!?!?!?!?
Somebody should really put him in Mortal Kombat
This looks amazing I'm a huge Halloween fan
And yet another sequel.
They think they can kill him when he single handly took a firefighter team that has axes and saws. Smh
Can't wait
This looks awesome! I'm really looking forward to this.
Showed too many kills in my opinion. Pretty much just saw the best parts of the movie 😩
Hmmmm I like this one 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nice just show us the whole movie and all the creative deaths in the trailer.
wohoooo,he is angry :)))))
Halloween kills I like the movie because it’s Blumhouse and Michael Myers kills a lot of people in this trailer and I hope they show Michael Myers house🎃
We'll have to see what happens with this movie. Danny McBride helped write it and it's being directed by the guy that directed pineapple Express and your highness.
I think that this trailer maybe shows too much
taaatatatayadayaytayayayayayayayytaya yayayyayaaa
So are not going to talk about Michael killing the baby from the Halloween 🎃 prior at the old couples house 🏡
2:24 just an old lady walking around with lots of ppl holding a knife with blood 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 in a hospital 😂😂😂😂😂 this movie is trash already
Halloween 3: Warpath   Mike said ight, ENOUGH! I'm done holding back!
I hope Kyle Richards from The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills survives!!!!!! Don’t kill Kyle, Michael!!!!!
Gonna need some pretty high ground to stop this dude.
Ooo i love the new take on the classic music
Very nice of the trailer to show us the whole movie. Very convenient.
Freddy Krueger : "Is he with you? " Jason : "I thought he was with you."
I dig the Season of the Witch masks
Outstanding amazing 👌👌
What the heck, why are they showing all the kills in the trailer? I hate when movies do that. And When they basically just show the whole movie.
i cant wait for this!
I feel like this one Laurie gone finally die I just can’t see her surviving another Halloween 😭
"So how many deaths for this one?" Producer : yes
I'm looking forward to the film but the trailer revealed too much and showed too many murders
Really and old ass grandma vs Michael Myers.
Can't Wait, Micheal Myers Never Gets Old . It Will Be Good.
How can someone be so brutal yet so calm and collected.
omg how many times are you gonna make the same movie? This series shoulda ended when the first one ended.
I basically just watched the whole movie from this trailer. It’s all the same.
This is the horror version of the fast and furious franchise. “Next up, Michael Myers will be flying a helicopter while simultaneously manning the machine gun, mowing his victims down”.
For reals how many do we need lmao Halloween 🎃 💯 and Fast and the furious part 100 just sounds ridiculous Hollywood running out of ideas
So the people went purge on Michael? Will not end well with the people.
Them: "a man couldn't survive that fire" Michael: " Hold my beer"
To quote JonTron, “I have several questions” and observations:  1. HOW THE HELL IS MICHAEL MYERS STILL ALIVE AFTER GETTING SHOT IN THE EYE BY LAURIE'S DAUGHTER KAREN, HAVING TWO OF HIS FINGERS BEING SHOT OFF BY LAURIE, BEING STABBED IN THE SHOULDER BY LAURIE, BEING RUN OVER BY A POLICE CAR ON PURPOSE AND THEN LAURIE, KAREN AND LAURIE'S GRANDDAUGHTER SET THE WHOLE HOUSE ON FIRE BY FILLING THE WHOLE HOUSE WITH GAS AND THEY HAVE HIM TRAPPED IN A BASEMENT/BUNKER!!!?  2. Looks like both Jason and Leatherface have competition because Michael Myers is using some of their signature weapons to kill two teams of freakin firefighters AFTER COMING OUT OF A BURNING HOUSE!!(better be on the lookout, Freddy)  3. So now after who knows how many decades, all of Haddonfield are now going "Okay, we're going to kill this spawn of Satan that has been a plague on our town once and for all" and now believe Laurie(yeah, don’t ever mess with or question THE final girl in all of horror)  4. For once, a Karen we can root for especially around the end of the trailer she gets Michael's mask and goes "You want your mask back? Come and get it!!"  Just….holy shit I have not been this excited for a new Halloween movie since the 2018 reboot!! All I can say to John Carpenter, Universal Pictires, Miramax, and especially to Blumhouse are two things; 1. Don’t let us down after this awesome trailer!! and 2. SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!! IS IT OCTOBER YET!!?
Nobody: ....  Michael: Gots To See It Thru My Boy... 👁👄👁
I seen the new Halloween kills I seen that early
Evil dies tonight didn’t Jamie say that last movie and look Michael is still alive😏
Allisons mom:u want your mask come get it  Michael:guess ill have to do so😈
Was that the whole movie? 😂
They showed off way too many kills in the trailer
And fuck there making a another Halloween movie called Halloween Ends shouldn’t they know that michael Myers never dies
Am a 13 years old boy but biggest fan of Halloween Michael myers 🎃🎉 Michael myers is the best movies
The one thing that I came for, the theme tune and didn't get it 🙁
Brackett: Doctor, do you know what Haddonfield is? Families, children, all lined up in rows up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse?  Doctor Loomis: They could be.
Michael: your not that guy pal Jamie: uh huh. And you Michael: absolutely 🔪
Decisive strike
I wasn't too impressed with the 2018 version but I adore the "Season of the Witch" masks appearing here.
Bro this new theme my John carpenter is just fire 😩
He is relentless 😳😳😳😳😳
Michael predicted the current pandemic 40 years ago.
The only “evil” that dies is racism
Just do the matpat thing
Why Michael
Milk does a franchise good
Woww
Trailers these days... call 'em spoilers... really I should stop watching them, they show way too much.
He killing kids now😭😭
Does Michael Myers have super powers lol ;/
Great another one😒😒😒😒
Yeah boiiiiii
Welcome to the kill count where we….. I’m James A. Janisse.
John Carpenter's Halloween 1978-2021 is a FUCKING LEGEND. [Not the Season Of The Witch]
I bet in the 3rd movie he gets permanent tier 3.
welp just saw most of the movie..
who is going to have a longer franchise, Fast and Furious, or Halloween
Camera cuts off Michael  Michael: 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️💨💨
Jamie lee Curtis must be exauhasted
Lovely. Halloween forever.
This finna be a vibeeeee
Wtf another one? At least he’s not in Space lol
Yooo the Halloween 3 masks :0000 1:33
💯 Fantastic as Hell! 👏🔥👏🔥👏
Anthony Michael Hall fuck yea!!
This looks like the kind of straight to DVD movie that’s next to the rotisserie chicken in Walmart for 4.99$
you know 99.9% of these people hunting him down are just the hunted, they don't have a chance.
I’ve been watching dude since 1999 (Michael Myers) n now I’m starting to  wonder as a 29 yr old does this fucker ever die 😂😂😂just give me one movie he actually dies in.
Please stop leave the movie alone 🤦🏻‍♂️
Stop making these damn movies!
So basically we get a sequel because of the firemen??? perfect
OMG. This movie will NOT benefit my brain. I can not not watch it. Its compulsive obsessive man
Oh snap. The more Michael Myers kills, the more intense the series gets. Why I'm so extremely excited about this? I'm really ready for Halloween Kills
We're all going to ignore that Danny McBride has writing credit in this?
I got chilllssss The "COME AND GET IIIITTTT"
Cool, except that 11 kills were spoiled in this trailer
Wow I said that the new Halloween movie was going to suck cause there were really no where to go but I'm not a shamed to say I might b wrong this looks so good can't wait
This trailer is way too short ! i have only seen 90% of the kills/death, 100% of the main plot, 75% of the action scene... -_-
most of yall funny in this comment section 😂😂
Just another example of black washing propaganda.
Wow they used the silver shamrock halloween masks from the movie halloween III season of the witch 😄
It's obvious by this trailer, that Michael Myers was very upset that ppl are still using fluorescent bulbs instead of an LED energy saver ... Remember GO GREEN PEOPLE 🤣
@1:09 He just HAD to be Black!
Damn, didn't know Forrest was at "that" point of his career yet......damn.
Michael Myers vs John Wick? Anyone?

an american movie.
Rawrrrrrrrrrr
Why did i watch this spoiler? omg i thought it was a trailer,  experience ruined damn near full movie
*citizen z*
Looks killer can’t wait
laurie: “Evil dies tonight”   michael: “Bitch im right here”
Yeah!! After this movie, it's Halloween Ends
the couple of nurse and doctor murdered by Michael are the same couple at the last movie when Michael kills some people in the neighbourhood
I am 22 now at 72  he still alive  And so this comment is...
To end this whole movie series off we need a Michael vs Jason at camp crystal lake
NO WAY
It’s gonna take a nuke at this point!
Hi... I knew it, Michael Myers will never die! 😅 I'm waiting for October! Yes 👋🏻
Best Mask ever.
My hero
this trailer showed more deaths than the last 3 Halloween movies combined
A nice callback to Halloween 3
Immortal michael 🎃
If she doesn’t kill him in this movie….
Just run to Texas, get a machine gun, let the fucker follow you, and mow him down, dummy.
michel: "comes out and kill fire fighter (idk how to spell his name)  other fire fighters: "watches friend die while they have axes in their hands"
When they show the whole film in the trailer,that's saved me 20 quid
bruh october is four months away too early
Trailers are just terrible these days
I really hope James sees this trailer and prepares for the kills he’s about to count
I've spent 35 years watching horror movies and screaming at the merry band of protagonists to band together and I dunno maybe PRETEND THAT GUNS ARE A THING THAT EXISTS and go hunt the unstoppable killer together.  Hopefully this gives me that.
It hasn't been an original concept for a film in America for years now. Just cheesy ass, cash-grabbing, cliche-filled, bull shit sequels.
James is gonna be happy with the amount of kills
My boy Michael @1:28 getting his side hustle on driving for Uber. He has zero ratings so far, not sure why 🤔
The original idea for Halloween is that it was gonna be different scary stories each film….. except everyone likes Michael so much they just recycled it 100 times in 30 plus years…..
This looks really good, can’t wait for the dead meat to come out for it so I can watch it
I think this looks really good, I just can’t get past the fact that Michaels main nemesis is a 75 year old woman
This dude’s been slaying Haddonfield for over 40 years, so I guess it’s about time they got wise to his game before he ends up in the rest home.
They been trying to kill my man for 50 years
It looks kinda cool, but I don't know if I like this 'we are a group of tough women. Lets hunt down Michael Myers" concept. That isn't how slasher films are suppose to work. People are suppose to be scared of Michael Myers.
The capricious suit bodily cure because search psychophysically juggle up a standing invoice. tenuous, tiresome hamburger
Derrrrr we can’t write new movies derrr we just make spider man 2 over and over again
Notice the masks from "Season of the Witch".
Next halloween film lol mikey vs jason
Looks like this franchise will never end
I have watched this trailer about 50 times now!!!!! I am so beyond excited for this!😍😍😍😍😍
I ready
This man is more OP than Superman at this point 🤷‍♂️
Don't know how I feel about this I figured it would've ended with Halloween 2018
HE FINESSED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I hate overmilked series -- and this must be one of the most milked film series. Just let it die already. 😒 '80s slashers should remain in the past and be remembered with all their goods and bads.
I thought Michael Myers Don’t Kill Old People ?
Michael Myers is a Real Man.. he has a killing personality, at the end of the day and night he finds him self going back to his child hood home. to remind him that his family wasn't shit so he will continue killing until he finds a purpose which is death.
the way he walks outta the burning house and the firefighters looking at him is just insanely badass
Damn all it takes to never die , is to kill alot of people with a properly sharpened  chef's knife.... Remember if you want to live forever, better get to killing Asia's arent going to purge themselves #blessed....!
Oh ffs this is ridiculous now. The last film in 2018 was a fitting end for the entire story. This is just taking the piss now
Here we again
He already killed hundreds people just in the trailer WTF HAHAH 🤣❤️
What if, at the end of one of these trailers, we saw Michael  start walking faster towards someone until he ended up in a full sprint? Wouldn't that be terrifying?
Michael Learns To Kill Again
Nobody caught the nod to Halloween III
The beginning is a KILLER 😍😍😍
Hell of a response time
This movie will have the most kills out of any slasher movie
And people like to give Rob Zombie a hard time for his reboot of the series... The 2018 film was a mess and this looks even more ridiculous.  I do not like the Blumhouse series so far but I'll stick around for the kills. I'm also glad Jamie Lee Curtis is having fun with it and it's great to see some old faces returning, like Charles Cyphers. I hope it's a success for all involved and I hope people enjoy watching. Cheers!
Y'all noticed that the daughter is Michael Myers older sister fro' the Rob Zombie's 1st one
Dexter Morgan would be hella excited for this man
They need to remake make all monster horror movies
He's mask is different
Love this Version of the Soundtrack!
I'm really digging that cello arrangement of the Halloween theme!
This is prove human are more dangerous than ghosts.
I liked it better when Jamie was terrified as she should be, screaming oh god help me please. I sure hope Michael is alright after this one.
Ok. Can y’all kill him this time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
I LOVE Halloween.  I'm afraid this one appears to be more gore than suspense/atmosphere.  Hmmmm
she yaga’d his mask
And he’s back y’all
I’ve finally waited 3 years and he is gonna be more brutal and open and is going to kill and be the ultimate Michael Meyers and I’m so hyped
Towns people: we tired of this bullshit micheal we are standing up  Micheal; didn't I already kill you last year?
If the evil guy really, really, really, really did die at the end of the movie.. I will watch it.
this looks soooooo bad
We need another Freddy Krueger movie for fuck sakes😐
0:11 I’m convinced Jamie lee Curtis isn’t acting there, it’s just her genuine reaction to this franchise getting dragged out for another sequel
Looks like mob mentality is going to cancel him.
I feel like they just gave away most of the movie
Mistakes were made when they took his mask...looking forward to how that plans out
Halloween Ends October 14 2022
No need to watch the movie now 👀🙄
The people vs Michael Myers...I'll pass
I wonder if Michael will say at least one word in this or the next film, like he did in the rob zombie remake
It’s the job for one old lady and one teenage girl to hunt down a 6’5 close to 300 pound man and kill him. Seems legit 😂😂😂
trailer: exists   dead meat james: yeah, i'm going to make a 30 minute video about that
Love how the people who were dead in the park were wearing the Shamrock masks, that was a nice reference
If you think about it he has dead silence, awareness, and tracker.
y’all been beating on that man for over 40 years now y’all gon jump him😭
Guess who’s back?….Back again?….Michael’s back!!…To kill your friends!!
They done pissed this man off 😂
Wait is this new or old
WHY DID THEY SHOW OFF SO MANY OF THE KILLS??????
When Michael sees the children.  Michael: ignore
Michael Myers on stage three
Damn when is he gonna die lol
Halloween kills gonna be the best film this year
They are gonna keep this franchise going until Michael is in a wheelchair
You can’t kill the greatest killer of all time  🎃🔪
You could make a Kill Count video from the trailer alone.
So an elderly lady and her daughter are going to defeat Mike myers? Pass
His new mask has a burnt side.
Hollywood has been out of ideas for like 30 years at this point
I’m so tired of watching this now although he’s my fav it’s the same story line
Serial Killers cannot die. Except for Ghost Face.
I mean it was a pretty jerk move to leave him in a burning house
Let it burn !  No, Michael has more killing to do.
Supernaturel
Trailer sucks because it tells too much details.
H O L Y S H I T
Didn’t this guy die already ?
" a man couldn't survive that fire " " the more he kills, the more he transcends " "He is the essence of evil" We might actually get an explanation of why this mf can't die in this one
OMFGGGGGGG
i just hope this aint no PG 13.. that rating destroyed alot of movies...
So he’s basically a super zombie like Jason at this point right?
Returning characters include Tommy Doyle Marion Chambers Lindsey Wallace Lonnie Elam
I pray a time comes when people can just simply make new classics.... And not milk them
That looks good. Can't wait to see it.
Michael got a lot of XP kills right now..
I think it’s time to give it up. Halloween has been dragged,killed,brought back up for lack of anything better and ruined forever.
Damn! Mike upped his game!,
Ha. I dug the season of the witch masks in the trailer.
Let's hunt him down  Nah I'll hunt y'all's asses 😂
Wonderfull.  Bring it to 4k dolby atmos.  NOW.  Lol
Fk yes !!!! This is gonna be great
Who says you can't have a real housewife of Beverly Hills in a Halloween movie. Good to see Kyle do something more lately than the reality show. Wonder if she'll be in it more than 5 minutes though. That's the killer question 🤔
So does Jamie Lee Curtis namely by fanny blocking Danielle Harris killing off any chance of her taking all JLC’s limelight
Any dead by daylight players?
This looks so good I can’t wait
I'm actually excited to see this one!!
The old chick is the reason the whole series has gone to shit.
Spoiler alert.. the man you know as Michael Myers is really Jason Vorhees.
Ok I think this is great but. Whens it gonna end -_-
He's like a cat he has so many lives
He didnt die
Evil dies tonight..  Michael Myers:  and I took offense to that.
Well the Trailer shows way to much. Not Hyped at all.
Are we going to get a face reveal?!?!
This is going to be one hell of a movie and Kyle Richards returning from the first Halloween
YES KYLE ✨
Ugh hasn’t someone killed him yet!!!
I’m in Michael Myers team I vote for Michael
At least he's wearing a mask.
But why is no one talking about the masks from Halloween 3
Time to do Batman vs Micheal vs Alien
I'M IN HERE FOR RAPE!!!!!!!  Ow wait........ sorry I thought this was public counciling. My bad 🙏✌
Feel like they showed all the kills in this trailer lol
Jamie Lee Curtis been trying to kill Michael Myers for 50 years😭😭😭
Oh hey, it's that one movie.    Again.
What's the purpose of making a film of all this killing though
Ban knives
I really hope this is the final chapter of the Laurie Strode saga. Such talent and praise towards this series for so many reasons, it deserves a blowout ending!!
🤦🏻‍♂️
Better be more kills weren’t enough in the first one
This film better end with him wiping out all of Haddonfield and shots of all the bodies covering the streets
Laurie:evil dies tonight Michael: Hold my knife rq
"Evil dies tonight"  Michael: "anyways so I started swinging right?"
These movies are still fundamentally missing the point of how great the original Myers was...I mean, he WOULDN"T go hand to hand with a bunch of super fit firemen, he's not Jason Vorhees, he'd slip out the back avoiding as much contact as possible, hiding in the dark until he found his bloomin sister again...the WHOLE point of the boogeyman is you're not actually sure he exists, until its too late.
oh yay yet ANOTHER remake of a remake of a remake smh.
Michael Myers Supremacy🛐✨
Hype for this
Halloween insanity: Doing the same movie over and over expecting a different outcome
They just showed us the entire movie.
Alternative title: Mike Myers goes on a killing spree but townsfolk are hunting him down
great sooo... pretty much just watched the whole movie. 🤦🏻
brutal scenes I already wanted to see her
The plot twist is that it’s Lisa Vanderpump behind that mask.
Did I just see the entire movie?
No one gonna talk about the masks from Halloween 3
This is going to be a perfect "fan service" film! Part 1 was a great film to set the tone and pace, but this one will be an all out bloodbath! Also happy to see the boyfriend back, I think we were all waiting for him to get butchered in the first one, but now the time has come!
So it's everybody in Haddonfield vs an unstoppable mass murderer. Oh the body count will skyrocket.  Edit: that was good cover to the Halloween theme.
EVIL DIES TONIGHT MICHAEL: I AM MICHAEL FUCKING MAYERS, AM I A JOKE TO YOU?
This looks like it will be the best Halloween EVER!
Michael Myers dies when Jamie Lee Curtis dies... he’s only alive because of her...
I dont know about this
cannot wait for james to count these bodies
Brutal
*What's the point? Basically every film after part two is utterly superfluous.*
*I didn't think it was possible to kill a franchise that's already been dead for over 30 years. This film and it's predecessor did precisely that.*
Now just to see the killcount from dead meat
Ouuuu I can’t wait till thisss come OUT
Ight this definitely the last time he does right ? Lol
The Michael Myers movies supposed too been ended but the keep bringing him back
Hollywood can't find anything new to do?
È indistruttibile mamma mia gli 🇺🇸 sono i numeri ☝️ delle minchiate
They need to drop this movie series and move on.
What do you do for a living? Micheal:killing people I guess...
0:37 is this a H20 callback?
Damn bro rip firefighters
:D
0:44 to 2:01 Michael literally became more savage than Freddy Krueger
OMG HE HAS AN AXE AND CHAINSAW IN THIS ONE HOLY FUUUUUCKKK THIS IS FUUUCCKKKIIING COOOOL THIS AND THE ORIGINALS ARE 100000000× BETTER THAN RIB ZIMBIES SHIT VERSIONS
Oh they about to let Michael Myers go fuckin CRAZY in this one and I can’t wait, the whole town bouta go after his ass??? Lol this about to be like Madara Vs. Shinobi alliance lol
New Year.... Same Shit..... Lol
town: we kill him tonight  micheal: "oh, oh shiver me timbers"
can’t wait 😝
This released too much in just the trailer
Bro if this movie doesn’t have Michael soloing an entire town imma be mad.
I thought Allyson was gonna be the new Michael Myers
Gotcha Mask 🤣
I'm a big fan of Halloween and loved the last one. However I think they should have ended it with the last one. It was a great way to end it.
Michael is the real Boogey Man. Where is John Wick when you need him?
The trailer pretty much showed the whole movie
Why does Michael keep getting let out of jail. I’m afraid that’ll be a Halloween: Tokyo
Michael Myers is immortal
Are they finally gone kill off the micheal Myers franchise
Damn I’m exited for this
Nightmare on Elm Street would be nice
LOOKS DREADFUL......I'm surprised at Jamie Lee Curtis....is she REALLY that desperate for the money?...
fun fact: the women in 2:01 is Lindsay Wallace from the original movie
I KNEW IT
for the love of god, stop!
I Feel like Michael Myers going to kill all of them But when it gets to the end Him vs his sister I think she will win (my opinion
Movie looks action packed but the kills  part doesn't sound right with the Halloween name
This movies looks good than the first one
Please fucking retire this fanchise.....you are ruining it...
Kenny Powers wrote this movie too!
Cant wait for dead meat to kill count this
Can not wait !!!
This trailer looks much interesting than last time haha and one question: WHY YOU CHANGE ORIGINAL THEME :cc
Now this is what i call real strong women..
A shame Rob Zombie wasn’t the director... 😐
I hope we can get some closure here. I want to see Michael's face reveal (current face not his kid face) and I actually want Michael to be put to rest. Classics are always the best. I just think its time to end the story and then if they want to reboot it again they can. Me personally I would like to see a Michael Myers vs Jason movie or Michael Myers vs Leatherface.
Trailer looks amazing! I just feel like they might have shown too much though, but who knows..MICHAEL F***ing MYERS is back
The whole Film in 2min. THX MAN
I knew this would happen when they’re stupid asses walked away from the house before they watched it burn to ash 🤦🏼‍♂️  You can’t fix stupid 🤪🤣
Fucking gassed
How is he STILL ALIVE?
At this point, he's purging every one who gets in his way.  Imagine seeing Michael one of the purging movies? Do like a crossover?
The frantic texture preferentially educate because donna bilaterally influence before a forgetful shallot. aggressive, outgoing part
I hope we get a badass fight scene with the firefighters vs Michael Myers
The towns going to jump Michael lol
The last one was shit anyway, and this one has SJW shit in it.
This looks like a good ass movie in a shitty cringe filled world
Guess Michaels been following the Coronavirus rules like wearing a mask
Love the Halloween 3 nods
We love these kind of movies and wait so long to see it like friday the 13th and texas chainsaw nowdays directors should come out frequently with that kind of movies
Oh, this guy is evil. He kills firefighters.
This Shit Just Ran Up On Me Like A Phone Bill. Bruh I Cannot Wait. Really Can't Believe There Making Another One. 😯😯😯😯
Oh no; it looks trash.
He’s going to survive this one too just watch.
Im kind of annoyed, the other one actually seemed final. Lori turned the tables, trapped him and burned him. I mean I guess it is possible the firefighters would go since that their job so I am not too mad at the fact that he is alive since it is fairly realistic Im just mad at the firefighters for doing their job(just in this case of  course)
I don’t get it, WE LIVE IN AMERICA. Go in an opens filed with 10 buddy’s. All have guns. And shoot when he comes the end
nah does Michael Myers got superpowers or what? No way he killed all them Firefighters
YEAH, THE DUMBENING CONTINUES !
Mike had better drop a 4K 20bomb in this lobby or imma be highly disappointed.
Who's the guy on the right in the car at 1:36?
Michael always survives no matter what
So why the trailer gotta show ALL the death scenes bruh thanks for the spoil
Micheal perceives killing the same way we decide to sleep in on summer break Cuz why not?
Now now a movie I’m excited for
Michael: dies Also Michael:  salutations
This movie better be good
Looks so bad 😂
My mom always talks about how much she loves Michael Myers, just to sh*t on him I say that John Wick is called Baba Yaga because *he kills the boogie man* plus the other day we were arguing about who’s better right, so she said look up who’s killed more people, so I did, turns out John has more kills than Michael AND Jason COMBINED with their total of about 100 movies
2:19 did Michael Myers kill Allyson ?
Ok now they making this to stupid like wtf halloween is my favorite horror but damn come on now when John carpenter didnt want to do it again after the first one. Like why keep messing up something thats good well was good. Smh damn Michael shouldve been dead a longtime ago
I prefer Micheal Myers over Jason all day everyday.....but not over ol skool Freddy Kruger....but i cant lie, Micheal is the scariest of the 3....Freddy is the funniest slasher....Jason is the most  relentless slasher...
Michael is more pernacious than my second wife.
All I can day is  Yes mate! Fuck yes mate!
Will this be the last movie ?
Hard to kill?
i swear you load a whole minigun to his face and he will just walk it off
"I prayed that he would burn in Hell, but in my heart I knew that Hell would not have him."- Dr. Samuel Loomis
Michael Myers at horror nights 2021????
Yessssssss hell ya
They gonna keep milking this
Dayuuummmm!! Sweeeeet
Michael survives a fire and kills how many people throughout the movie and the mom walking out of the hospital with a Walmart kitchen knife thinks she can kill Michael? This is comedy boys not a horror movie.
Michael Myers is like Thanos, instead of making half of the human population disappear, he's literally cutting it in half.
Anyone else think this would make an awesome Friday the 13th trailer?
The last one was really good, I hope this one is a satisfying conclusion to the “trilogy”.
Yooo is he Leatherface??? Mortal Kombat has a character just like him.... Damn!
Can't wait already 🎃 🎃 🎃
Just end it already
"let it burn"  Michael: drinks fire resistance pition
IDK Might be lit,as long as it's no koofy shit in there
Haddonfield town population 5,000 at the beginning of the movie.  By the end, the town population is 4.  Lol
Halloween is getting more modernized than before, very interesting.
I love Halloween series
https://youtu.be/z4AwHeawvGU
Yessssirrrr!🔥🔥
Looks horrible and the last one suck
Did they just make the Shamrock thing from Halloween 3 canon?
Why am I already not impressed 😔🙄 and why does it look like the trailer told everything
This trailer is freaking Awesome
The brown lasagna surely borrow because mexico markedly deceive aside a clumsy hobbies. subdued, alcoholic corn
🔥 wish some people could just watch the trailer without making prediction and breakdown vids everytime a new trailer comes out🤦‍♂️ shit just kills the hype
H20 Lorie solos entire movie
Love the callback to Season of the Witch with the Skull, Pumpkin, and Witch masks
now fear is comming
Gotta give kudos to those firefighters man. They stood their ground and tried fighting off Michael.
Damn, not even COVID-19 can’t stop Michael!?
Michael vs Thanos
reminding me of Madara vs the whole shinobi alliance
Thanks to Dead Meat, I counted at least 14 kills 🤣😂
CLASSIC 🎥 HALLOWEEN IS MY FAVORITE TIME OF THE YEAR !!!!! 🎃
They have milked this series dry
If they don’t kill him in this movie I’m gonna have to do something ..
He's inmortal LOL
Boring
Coming to a AMC theater near you! I like the stonk
i love michael myers 🔪🔪🔪
“Destiny arrives. Or should I say—I have.”
OMG finally something from my childhood
So I guess This movie and Halloween ends are probably going to take place all on the same Halloween night.
Well there goes sleeping for tonight 🤦🏽‍♂️
Besides I'm Surprised Fortnite Hasn't made a Michael Myres Crossover
The firefighters will be the beginning scene of Halloween Kills
They are dragging this movie at this point .
Superman vs Michael Myers??
Halloween does not stop..
IDC THEY BETTER NOT KILL HIM
How bout…Halloween ENDS….enough already!
I bet James finna count these bodies 🕺😎
🔥🔥🔥
Michael is the only reason I watch halloween series they should not kill Micheal instead if a protagonist die it is okay
OMG!!! OCT 15TH UGHHHHH YA KILLIN ME I CAINT WAIT!!!!
OF COURSE ITS OCTOBER! (I almost Forgot About Micheal) But EPIC! And I thought Halloween (2018) was THE Deadliest Holloween Movie out there! But this takes the entire Cake and Icing!!!!
People: exist   Michael Myers: so anyway I started blasting
Thanos would be running for the hills if he had to fight Michael lol
Who else noticed the Halloween 3 silver shamrock masks
"No one told you."  LAURIE IS MICHAEL'S SISTER AGAIN???
All I can say is WOW.
It really does look like they want this series to end. They are really trying to kill him now
He's now more COOING, more BRUTAL, and more DEADLIER than EVER
Damn all these guns and cant no one kill mike. Hes like John Wick.
Hell ya!!
Halloween part 12.  It’ll end next at 13 (Halloween Ends - 2022).
Cant to see Myers hook survivors and facecamp
Who cares about a white man going on a killing spree? Why watch a movie when you can see it on REEL life?
Yoooo are those masks at 1:32 the same masks in Halloween 3??? Great reference to that movie!
October what TELLL USSS
Michael VS Jason!!!
LETSSS GOOOOOO
Getting so ridiculous! Just stop already.
I just got the fucking CHILLS!!!😰 I can’t wait to watch this
They should pay chucky to finish him and have ghost face avenge him
cant wait for dead meat to get their hands on this
If she doesn’t stop him this time imma have to step in
Trailers these days reveal so much
This is the most violent trailer I’ve ever seen
Guys its simple just stare at him so he doesnt get to tier 3 and 1 tap you
At this point why didn’t they just get a SWAT team?
Evil never dies that why it on earth
There the whole movie I won't see it in theater promise it like original halloween 2 boring
Just tell Michael it's not his fault and, he will stop lol. Psychology almost always works lol.
I think I see every kills in this movies
All suck because of the trailer
Okay, im excited to watch the kill count on dead meat when this comes out on blu-ray
Zzzzzzzzzz... it’s been 40 years. Next.
I like the bit where all the cool stuff is in the trailer and then nothing new happens when I pay 30 dollars to see it
kind of makes me wanna go watch the first one now
This looks so good!!! I'M SO EXCITEDDD
Need the soooong
This movie is hogwash
Cool I can't wait.
Here we go again🔥
This man just turned into jason voorhees 2.0
Isn't Michael Myers like 85 years old now....
1:56 Lindsay chase scene!!! Hope this is similar to Tinas scene in Halloween 4 if not better! Can't wait to see Lindsay and Tommy's scene with their encounter with the shape after so many years.
I wish they could’ve had loomis in these movie
this movie is distributed by disney
The shamrock masks from Halloween 3: Season of the Witch 🎃🐰
Well we just watched the whole movie in 2:30. Trailer kind of showed it all 😂
god dat music is song of devil i am still afraid of it when i hear
Im soo ready
When is it ever gonna end? Enough is enough
Very excited for this movie to come I have been waiting a long time here it is
Seen the whole movie in 2:30
The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “There will be a tribulation in which the one asleep is better than one lying down, the one lying down is better than the one sitting, the one sitting is better than the one standing, the one standing is better than the one walking, the one walking is better than the one riding, and the one riding is better than the one running. All of those killed on both sides are in Hellfire.” I said, “O Messenger of Allah, when will that happen.” The Prophet said, “Those are the days of slaughter.” I said, “When are the days of slaughter?” The Prophet said, “When a man is not safe in his own gathering.” I said, “What do you order me to do if I witness that?” The Prophet said, “Hold yourself back, restrain your hands, and stay in your residence.” I said, “O Messenger of Allah, what is your view if a man breaks into my residence?” The Prophet said, “Go into your house.” I said, “What is your view if he enters my house?” The Prophet said, “Go into your prayer room and do like this,” and he grasped his elbow with his right hand, “And say ‘my Lord is Allah’ until you die upon that.”  Source: Musnad Aḥmad 4286
We just saw the the whole movie
I swear that mask must be fire proof or something
Hyped 🎃
Technically this is the first Halloween 3 to be a michael Myers movie
They have the silver shamrock masks
So many kills in the trailer. Cant wait to see all the kills in the movie it better reach double digits.
Michael Myers vs Jason Voorhees
Nice to know Michel now works on Doom slayer logic
Up Next, Michael Myers vs The World
Can we ever get an explanation on why Michael survives being burned alive twice shot 6 times and fell from the 2nd story balcony but still have the energy to go on these sprees
*0:35* I'm back *B!+¢H3$*
Oh what do you know,  another Halloween movie,  who would've thought
Now this is what I call a horror movie trailer! So awesome and scary it really excites me for it
Michael: “…so then she says you want your mask come get it…and I killed the bitch”
I love Jamie she’s my favorite person in the movie
Nah man
I didn’t know he had superpowers. In the first one you can clearly see the house fire is on him. At that point even if they start to put out the fire and it only takes 30 seconds to do it he would have still been roasted. This sfi fi movie is dumb.
My theory is Laurie strode dies in this one, and the grand daughter kills Michael in Halloween ends, also the daughter also dies Halloween kills.  Not a spoiler, just what my prediction is.
So we know there's gonna be one more, I wonder how Michael is gonna pull it off again. He's clearly reached level 99
'Yeah how many more times can Michael return?!  Well, who am I KIDDING?! October hurry up!
Michael will be killing people for the next 200 years
Watch out most likely gonna wait for it to come out on blue ray or dvd to purchase the movie
Jamie Lee Curtis will be milking this until she literally dies
Michael Myers is a boom boom head
Michael Myers films really tense me up and give me goosebumps he is scarier than any other slasher
This should be the highest grossing film in worldwide
Nice
lots of kills in one trailer. hope they have more.
Mike is always on unlimited Evil Within Tier 3, any dbd players here? No? Ok..
This is my favorite horror franchise. The first Rob Zombie one was amazing, but these last two are wearing a little thing on me.
"I'm not just gonna sit and watch another innocent person die" Everyone in the comments:"🍿👀"
James a janisse is going crazy right now
Ehhh idk kinda sketchy
Michael killing on a wheelchair  going to be epic
Eu tenho uma tatoo enorme desse cara no meu braço. I love Michael Myers. Don't let me down Laurie.
Yessssir!!!!! They got a part 2 of Halloween 🎃!!!🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪 Can’t wait to see this man frfr!!! Can’t believe he came back!
MM is pissed
And why the Hell do they show Major kills in the trailer? Apparently there's 30 kills in the film but that doesn't make it good. It's like in Jurassic World, they advertise "More Dinosaurs than you've ever seen" but they're Just covering up Bad filmmaking.
Looks pretty bad ass!
This proves how deadly the knives are. Ban those assault knives. 😆
Why did they switch the music smh
i love the sound direction
Im happy what they did with the firefighters
Michael is that guy pal
Anyone else miss the 6'7 and 6'9 Michael Myers ?
Let’s go  another one
Looks awesome!
I hope this movie be released this year
Suck it Jason!
OMG I’m watching real housewives of Beverly Hills and I see Kyle Richards 😍backstory kyle Richers played in Halloween when she was a little girl
Michael is fucking zombie man can't even feel pain when he was shot on he's hands
I'll always watch as long as Jamie Lee is in it 👌
Wait Wait Wait... Did they *really* expect the fire brigade to Just leave the house to burn?? And why did the mask not even burn?
Ok we have new Halloween movies but the real question is can we get a Friday the 13th movie
Even cats envy how many lives he has.
Laurie: "Let him burn!" Michael: "So you just gone belt out Ushers (Let It Burn) Laurie? Alright, I'm about to put cases on all you bitches!"
Can't fuckin wait
I’m waiting for 3c films now
Love these movies
Why…
You're telling me a bunch of burly firefighters can't kill one scorched up serial killer.
Sometimes less is more and this would have been one of those times..
Another one The Hunter is Being Hunted I wonder is Michael same person of all the Other Halloween movies
Wow this is going to be hot garbage
i'm so excited
If i wasnt 49 i would be so excited to see this movie. But since I am 49. I can wait til it pops up on TV on a day I'm super bored. Yall enjoy.
I really want to see this. But after this I feel I have.
Laurie’s granddaughter reminds him of judith for some reason i dont think his gonna hurt her
Man...I can't wait!!!!
I’m excited! But they basically just showed the entire movie 😂
So, Wondering if we’re gonna get a Michael v. Hubie Dubois showdown?
I like how they’re trying to kill him as if that’s worked in any of the past movies
I’m fucking pumped
honestly forgot about the fire in the last one and my friend was an extra so i saw it way to many times
Is no one gonna talk about the reference to Halloween 3 with the three masks shown, the pumpkin mask, skeleton mask and witch mask?
evil never dies.
Man when are they just gonna end him once and for all and just call it a day damn keep milking these lame movies
The music in these trailers never fail to get me hyped
Are they chanting “We want Myers!” Or “kill Michael Myers!”?
YESS SO EXCITED
Definitely honoring sequel rule number one, the body count is always bigger
Kinda seems like they gave away too much
This looks so good 😩
Still waiting for a new Friday the 13th movie
What kind of mask does he use it never burns
This looks great  I’m glad they’re not using Zombie’s for continuity I hated those movies
Jesus Christ is Lord. Repent and believe the Gospel. That Christ died for your sins and was raised on the third day. God bless you all. Amen.
About time… it comes out.
Another Halloween movie???... you've gots to be kidding!!!... how many times are they gonna keep making and playing the same broken record???
Anyone ejse think the trailer spoiled several potential jump scares and plot points in the movie?
Still feel like my mate mike will be "Killed" this flim, nothing will top rob zombie doe
Are we eventually going to see Jamie Lee Curtis so old in a wheel chair wearing an oxygen mask and still fighting off Meyers because he JUST CANT DIE!!!   How long is this going to run?!   My GOD!  Talk about milking it to DEATH!  Corporate greed!
please never stop making halloween movies <3
Love michael Myers movies dam cant wait
Favorite Movie  The best serial killers all time
Now THIS SHIT HARD
Michael Myers : fastest walker of all time
I feel like In this film, we will see exactly what exactly Michael is.
Michael Myers looking sharp these days.
Homie really went from burning right to murdering lmaooooo.
“He can’t hurt anyone again” Michael:  You must be new here…
On some real shit imma be mad as hell if they kill Michael Myers
the scene with the firefighters gave me chills... i just wish it would release on demand as well bc my theaters are still closed
Whole movie is in trailer
at first i was like.. really? another one? ...then i was like oh fuck yea..cant wait
Laurie: Evil dies tonight.  Michael: Oh no! Anyways.
We put Michael Myers through a woodchipper, burned the pieces of his body in a crematorium, scattered the ashes in an active volcano, and Michael Myers is still alive. The gimmick is beyond tired.
James from Dead Meat would be creaming over this 🤣
showed half the fucking kills in the trailer alone.
Ojito piojito 👀👀👀
Laurie's forgetting one thing " you can't kill the Boogeyman ".
You can’t kill what can’t die in our hearts we’ll bring him back every time
Awesome can't wait
Jason Vorhees over Micheal Myers we need that new Friday the 13th
Michael wouldn’t fuck Jason up, but he’d def win lol  This looks Watchable though! Just for the theme song and you know someone is getting stabbed to a wall
Holy shit
😂😂😂I can’t fucking wait
This reboot series makes the same mistakes that the other sequels made. Those mistakes were ironically reasons for the reboot. The original didn't make those mistakes.  -too much blatant gore -killing people just to kill them. -psychotic psychiatrist -supernatural being  The original was shrouded in mystery. Michael Myers escaped the asylum and stalked his prey. The sequels were nothing but blood fest with nonsensical stories.
Godzilla and Kong would have to team up again to kill him for good.
Man dude I am so sick of these no more end them
I love how they portrayed Jamie Lee Curtis to be more of a savage in this series
From what it looks like Michael hides in that gun storage in the basement 2 survive that fire
Doesn’t matter how fast you run, Michael’s walk will catch you expeditiously
1:02 "Somebody in there?" *yup*
No matter how fast you run in life, Michael Myers will always walk faster than you
I'm calling it Halloween: Genocide  instead because it's obvious that what going on in the trailer.
I’m readyyyyyy
Bro we need 666 Mike back...
Michael Myers is so badass in this trailer
Michael keeps on going, but hey so does LAURIE!
Them: “ a man couldn’t survive that fire “  Me: “ pulls out a lightsaber “
Looks awesome good to see horror remakes done properly.same company should take over friday the 13th do that properly.Big thumbs up blumhouse well done
Spoiler: The Shape does not die at the end...
I'm glad there was such a big gap in-between this film and the last one. Looks like these movies aren't being rushed out which is assuring since rushed sequels almost killed the franchise
This guy never dies they have been trying to kill since 1978
Jamie Lee you been saying the same thing for 40 years and ain’t kill him yet. Shut up 😂
This souls be called Resident evil 4: Halloween kills
Woahhhhhhhh ....
Jamie Lee Curtis in a another movie I thought her character was dead six movies ago lol😂😂😂
Micheal Do you hear me ?
I love the season of the witch mask
Lame
I would just probably kill myself if he was after me … cause clearly this man can’t die 🥴lol
Tier 3 Mickey looks great
Since halloween(2018) was the first micheal myers movie because they said ignore every other movie this is the first. I wanna see whats his anger and why isnt he dieing if he was just a normal person before
Another one? Really?
Fireman are impressive physical specimens who's job demands they remain in peak prime condition. Michael wouldn't pick them off that easy js
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Haddonfield Illinois Police Department: Michael Myers is dead, he can’t hurt you!  Michael Myers: Hold my mask and knife, then give them back to me!
This film is basically what Halloween 3 the season of the witch would of been if the story was about Michael Myers instead of this cult trying to murder kids by using Halloween masks beaches 👍
I am the only one among us who prefers the Rob Zombie Halloweens. Does that make me the imposter?
Yes!!!!
That looks so trash
Boring. Come up with new ideas. Same crap re hashed over and over again.
"Halloween 2022", not the year but the iteration. Why not just have a movie about a dead horse being flogged, and flogged, and flogged?
Looks good enough to me to want to see Halloween kills at the movie theater in the town that I live in but right now at least I am just hoping that they get Halloween ends filmed, released into movie theaters in the U.S.A. and released onto blu-ray dvd in the U.S.A. BEFORE Judy Greer turns 50 years old.
Looking forward to seeing this.
This is the first ACTUAL Halloween 3!
Can’t wait 🎃
Swear they just trying to milk the series just like fast and furious 😂😂
i thought he was gonna come out the house black with an afro!
This trailer showed the whole damn movie. It looks good and I’m still going to see it but it’s the principle. We did not need to see all those kids. Leave a bit of mystery.
Dis Michael Myers a fan Favorite
Probably not him but a copy cat killer there will be another movie I bet
I hope he doesnt just kill all the way through. The suspense in the first one with the wide camera angles and him in the backgrounds was awesome. Dont ruin it now.
must watch this movie
I love it, but they practically showed the whole movie!
the bogeyman the is John Wick
Love the Halloween 3 references!
GREAT! They just showed the entire movie in this trailer.
he’s in tier 3 at this point, he’s gonna mori everyone in this movie
When did this Nigga become Superman
Let’s go Been waiting for this
J Curtis still got it LAURIE FUCKING STRODE
Of course they show the whole fucking movie in the trailer
Dang there’s no taking this guy down
Imagine Michael killed John wicks dog 💀 then he’d really be gone
I can’t be the only one slightly turned on every time he comes back to life
The fact the firemen thought back, witch i reckon in reality they would. fearless mofuckers. cant wait for this though, been waiting too long.
At this point he might as well fight the avengers🤷🏻‍♂️
I love that the Silver Shamrock masks are in it.
No cap, this trailer doesn’t get me as hyped as the Halloween 2018 official trailer does, but damn it does look like it will be a better film.
Is it just me or did it look like he kinda hesitated to stab his Niece I guess she would be. Allyson.
Someone call Jon Wick
I feel like they should've left how he got out of the house outside of the trailer. Yeah I understand it had something to do with the firefighters based off the teasers, but come on. This trailer has ruined something I expected to see in theaters
I predict that the end of this trilogy will result in the actual death of Michael Myers. But only once Laurie dies too. They are linked by fate. The good to his evil
So did his fingers Jamie lee Curtis blew off in the last one magically regrow?
The scary thing about this is that nobody knows what he looks like under the mask, he could just take it off and blend in with the crowd
SPOILED through 1 thrailer wow
Hmmm..so Marcus, Vanessa, and Marion Chambers die. All 3 in those Halloween 3 masks at the park.
something about this trailer makes me root for michael. Might have to go get counselling after watching this in october
yesssss i cant wait
Michael is clearly ignoring social distancing guidelines. However, he is wearing a face covering.
Sus
I fux with it
Cool thanks for showing us the whole movie in 3 minutes. 👍
#teammichael if you can’t beat him, join him 🤣
let's hunt him down! myers: Surely you don’t intend to challenge me, stupidity of this magnitude cant possibly exist. prepare to die!
JLC is an amazing actress. She is the only Laurie Strode. Laurie is a badass by force, not choice. Her strength came at a great personal cost. Failed marriage, alcoholic, estranged from her daughter.   Often times we are strong because there is no other choice. Survive or die.  Halloween rocks!
I wish Freddie and Jason could make some originals and be just as good what is going on. I know there's a big huge cocker ride and all that but all the BS needs to go out the window and just make some good movies already damn
I just noticed the “Evil Dies Tonight!” Chant throughout the trailer. Chills.
Showed the entire movie in this trailer. Saved $20.
this is badass 💁🏽‍♀️
I would love for the last scene to have someone say, noone knows what we are dealing with. And for a female voice to say, I KNOW HIM.... and it's Loomis offspring.
Too much showing.  Almost the complete story line.
There's nothing better than Michael Myers killing someone on a fire
So I never did watch these movies growing up, but I've recently binged them all and I have to say they had a fairly boring start.  The first few movies follow the same format with Loomis running around screaming "Michael is the devil!" and the town in constant denial that a killer runs through at Halloween time with a kitchen knife.  In my opinion the only ones that seemed compelling were H20, the Rob Zombie remake, and the last film.  This one looks good and the trailer has me stoked, but I will say they showed way too much including all the kills.  Half of what makes slasher films interesting are the kills and they gave quite a few of them away!
Hahaha darkness of lord welcome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=5s
Me: they're doing too much with this franchise now. It should've ended a long time ago.  Also me: I can't wait to see this!!
Fuck! Can’t wait
Two fire engines worth of people who most likely have access to at least one axe couldn't take him down? Also it's obvious he will survive this and the kills are very predictable now. This is purely for money
“How many spoilers can we fit in one trailer?” I don’t even wanna watch it any more 😭
Brutally Awesome.
Hopefully new Michael skins in dbd
why did they have to show the opening god dam it
Evil dies tonight. I don't think so, only one thing can stop Michael, box office failure. And this hasn't happened yet.
They spoiled the whole movie!
another calling to action Micheal Myers film wow so stupid
michael, hunting his random relatives: 😍✌🏻🥰💀👹👹👹
They brought back the silver shamrock Mask
So...a whole group of firefighters just stood around and got killed to death?  This franchise 😔😔😔
Calling it now the boogyman gets boogymanned
this finna be a story
Is it just me or did this trailer just ruin the entire movie? Why show all the deaths?
This is exactly what I wanted the sequel to be taking place right after the first shits going to be epic
Can’t wait for the next one to come out, and another, and another… 😂
I can watch this trailer over & over for the next 4months until the movie is released 🔥🎬🔪 📽  CANT WAIT 😱
LES GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
Welp , thanks trailer. now I know who dies in this movie
Mans boutta go Solo v Squads in this movie yfm 😂
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS.....   *2 hours later*   ....SSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Oh yes 👍
their gonna regret not letting him burn
He is Brutal in these new Halloween movies and i love it
"You look like MïkiEL MíHerS" was the first thing that popped into my head iykyk
yo this shit looks lit. also I love seeing him fuck up firefighters. visual stun
yes girl show us literally everything
I got to watch this movie
I love the Easter egg for season of the witch!!!
@DeadMeat
I always wonder wtf is Michael Myers!!?? Is he some type of supernatural entity or what? The previous contradict themselves.
I just wanna know how Michael is like 62 in this movie. And in the last movie he was shot a handful of times. Stabbed. Set on fire and had his hand blown off by a shotgun but he seems totally unphased
Huge fan, can't wait. I feel like this 1s gonna be good.
I stg if Laurie dies in this movie I will be so pissed
Den är cool
Yo this looks sick
❤YESSSSSSS!!!❤
Jamie lee Curtis’ career owed to Michael Myers!
This looks a lot better than the last one to me. I prefer the supernatural element to Mike Myers. Makes a 60-year-old man seem creepier. The transcending line and inferring that Mike Myers is evil incarnate are good lines.  The last film where they went for suspension in the house dragged on way too long and was boring IMO. This seems to have a lot more kills, which is always nice for horror films I would say, and some of them look quite interesting to me.
New Halloween!!!!!!!
That town's census is going to be ZERO lmao
Avengers: we have a Hulk Haddonfield:  we have Michael Myers
THIS LOOKS FUCKING AMAZING OMG
Yeah...not excited for this. Bet it's gonna be worse than the last one for sure
Cant wait to see Michael drop rhat mob fill of baseball bats
Laurie being a bad ass queen like always
Imagine not watching this the day it come out omg
Jamie keeps saying he has to die for good, but it never happens. Poor Jamie
We all know that Jason Voorhees would win in a death tournament then Michael Myers
Beat that dead horse hollywood
Michael Myers vs Jason movie coming never
just use flashlight n pallet stun him gg ez
It’s gone suck if he dies😞
Even if hes the weakest out of Jason and Freddy, Hes so damn cold blooded and he doesnt care how old you are he will send your ass to heaven
No, esto es una porquería de secuela. Paren ya en estar haciendo eso con la película original... Halloween XD
Omg yesssss I so excited for this movie can't wait...😁😁😁😁😁
I swear, Michael is invincible and there is going to be like 45 more movies🤦‍♀️
I love it . This is my favorite halloween movie but in 2018 one guy from cinema didn't let me to watch the halloween 201i movie but now he will let me or he will die!!!!!😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈👻
With his size and athleticism he could have been in the nba, nfl, nhl, even an Olympian. He chose to kill.
Archangel MICHAEL is immortal and is doing the Lord's work.
They better not be bringing back Tommy, Lindsey, and Marion just to kill them off. Especially Marion, they’d just be killing her off again.
I wonder how much of Halloween 2 (1981) are they going to use. I see they are in the hospital. Out of all the movies Halloween 2 has The best ending.
the body count alone just from the trailer 💀🔪😅
This will be the last part,,
If this is the trailer..then is anything left for the movie 🤔😬
cool way to bring the supernatural elements from the original movies to the modern ones without making it corny
Michael Myers wouldn’t pull that bullshit in OBlock…ijs
Not all my boys getting murderized tryna put out a fire
Friday the 13th next please
Wasn’t there one where JLC cut his head off after a car wreck? How did it continue after that one? I haven’t seen all of them.
Have they ever tried using grenades or rocket launchers?
Andddd just shows every single kill in the whole movie..
Michel Myers theme song is just 😍😍
I've been waiting for his return...
pretty much just showed us the whole film... thanks alot.
Aight I get it's fictional, but come on now. I've seen this dude die like 20 times. He didn't have superpowers as far as I know. At this point it's getting boring
𝐋𝐄𝐓 𝐈𝐓 𝐁𝐔𝐑𝐍
I am SOOOO excited to see Kyle Richards in this! <3
That's it. I don't have to see the rest of the movie now 👍🏻thx
Michael Myers: You're not that guy pal Firefighters: Are you? Michael Myers: Absolutely 🔪🔪🔪
Does anyone know if John Carpenter is sitting in on these films? because this just looks like pure rubbish, so far away from the first and the second one I get it blood and gore, but that's not how this film started it was the thrill of him stalking and find his victims, this just looks like a body count, I will watch it but, I can see already this is going to be a hack'em up film, can't wait for Jason goes to Washington part 34.
THE EVIL IS BACK
Who else noticed the masks from Halloween three 👀👻
Only true Halloween fans are excited about this
Hes legend of evil he is the hell
We need a kill count just for the trailer.
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
They showed to much
I’m sorry but they should never stop doing a Michael Myers movie. ❤️❤️❤️
gave me goosebumps good sign
İ like this film. From Azerbaijan like also
Idk about you… but Jamie Lee over here BECOMING MIKE MYERS.
Only Satan himself  could  survive that fire. HE IS SATAN !!
What's with trailers showing the entire movie, christ
If you love horror movies, you're going to see the movie and love it for what it is. Not a horror movie fan, you're going to see it and have something else to complain about on social media. Either way the film makers get their money.
Am I the only one who thinks they should let Michael die and return to the idea of this becoming an anthology series ala Halloween 3?
YES!! But damn when is he gonna die🤣
Now this is the Halloween movie that I want to see plenty of action and horror I love it
out of all the horror movie villain's Michael was always my favorite cant wait for this to come out
🔪🎃🔥
Michael back again 🔪🎃
HOLY FUCK. They were not kidding about the film being brutal. Those poor firefighters...
💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
He doesn't wanna die 💀
You know he’s killing a lot when they show actual murders in the trailer 😂😂😂
Man how many of these movies they gone make
How Jamie Lee back when she died in H2O? Lol
Yay i  am excited for the next chapter of Halloween
The part with the three's reactions of dread to the fire engines heading to the house, and the "LET IT BURN!" line is kinda haunting
Rob Zombie Halloween the best
This is so wholesome
Bro another one ?? ☠️☠️
Am honestly fed up with this.
what da dog doin
Wow so by watching this trailer I can see WHO TF DIES smh 😂
This movie is already great and it’s not even out yet!
Love these movies
"He cant hurt anyone again" Micheal: Hahahaa bitch you thought
I’ve watched all the Halloween movies and I’m just gonna say... I’m hyped up for this movie! It’s gonna be good!
1 Thessalonians 5:19 Quench not the Spirit.
1:33 those masks are from Halloween 3 nice reference
1:47  Thats the awkward walk i remember, thats "the shape". "1:58" real freaky where you can just make out the face of his mask. 2:12 that shot is so similar to the shot from Halloween 4 when Micheal stops the young dude from firing his shotgun, same blue lighting as well. I just luv the way this trailer is put together, looks very promising.
Jesus I'm just shocked people want to see this shit.
Lol damn all the murders in the trailer 😂
lol the original is soooo scary and i keep having to remind myself that unlike this movie it doesnt have a lot of deaths. sometimes it is better to do more with less? nice foley work in this trailer :3
Really, another one with Laurie?  How many times are you rewriting the history
Hello
This is gonna be epic
Took ma boi mask
He never dies ;/
How much do they wanna give away!!! The whole first scene!!! looks good though
Looks a great movie can't wait to have it on dvd
Im sooooo fucking stoked for this movie
How much more can you milk out of a premise so shallow you couldn't drench the souls of your feet in it? We're about to find out. ( smh )
Never end Halloween please
This is like Halloween 2?!
Lori Strode has been "coming for "Michael Meyers for 40 yrs now. Yawn.
oh god they could't just let him burn for Christ sakes? and i can't wait for this movie hell yeah!!!
Wooohooooo again a movie
SUMMER WITHOUT A SLASHER MOVIE?? NAHHHHHH!!!!!
In the threequel, I bet jamie lee curtis's character is gonna go fucking insane and become the new micheal myers but its like a mystery thing, so nobody knows who the new myers is.
This looks scarier  than  halloween 2018
Bro he came out the house like nothing touched him.
What’s going on out here Call the sheriff  Is this a prank? I’ve been trick or treated to death tonight U don’t know what death is  Halloween 2 theme plays
Such strong women lolololololol typicall modern say pedowood
Don't need to see the film seen all the deaths in the trailer
Yeah all the fighter fighters died because they couldn’t out run him huh  💀
Wooooo yes u just can't kill Michael Myers fkn Legend, Can't wait. LETSSS GOOOOOO
You don’t hunt Michael. Michael hunts YOU
So this is like the new updated Halloween 2 (1981).  Lauries in the hospital, it’s the same night as the previous one, and the theme is a techno version.
I cant wait for this, as a huge halloween fan, this does bring a smile to my face
This trailer should’ve started with a damn Spoiler Alert
..... this seems like a b-movie to me. And they literally showed the whole movie in this trailer. The fuck
I think He takes one firefighter's oxygen mask and that's why he survived.... then throws it away just after he come out of the house. I just have this feeling but only october knows!  Edit: maybe some "are you okay moments"
Eh
How to finally finish off Michael: Terminator style/Expendables style. Reveal Michael as a Terminator,which explains his unwillingness to die,despite being human form,he's a robotic killing machine. Get Laurie a Hale Caesar vaporizer gun & Michael falls into a hot vat, finally ending his reign of terror.
They should bring Busta rhymes back in this one.
Like for ever Micheal Mayers is back from the dead.
Damn the only thing more unkillable than him is this franchise. How many more will be made.
YES!!!
So stupid
Meh
Why can they bust these movies out so quick, but we can’t get another Friday The 13th. Must be some legalities
I'm seeing a good movie, but I have a looming thought that it won't be very good. All it'll be good at is having cool kills... hopefully not. I hope this'll be good.
Yes...please!
His come in👀
Sp exciting movie! I like horror movies, after my finals im gonna watch this and conjuring 3🙂🙂
I am him and we are you
Because everyone know that 11 movies just isn't enough.
Mike The Goat
Something to fall asleep to the nightmare will never end 😂
This needs to be the last one, it's time to end it.
They showed like the whole movie
I feel like they showed too much in this trailer  Also, I hope to God they don’t explain why he is immortal, don’t tell us, that makes it better!
Next movie Michael had a backup baby this whole time to keep his killings going.
“let’s hunt him down” Michael: Hunt who down? 🤣🤣
They really took his mask bruh lol
This is so awesome!!
Hell yes 😁 Damn i love these movies 👊
He's very angry...
They say Michael is  the boogeyman  But they also say that John wick is the man you send to kill the boogeyman…
He’s a man of commitment, focused and sheer fucking will
now this one looks better than any of the orthers NGL
For a human he sure does come back from the dead alot lol! Jason it makes more sense but Michael I mean come on yo
Anybody think she will finally get him this time...🤔🤔
This coming out on my birthday
Come on October Want to see this film 🎥
This shit never ends lol
Not sure how to feel about another Michael Myers movie.  Can they just end it already?
I cant wait to watch this 🖤🧡🖤🧡🎃!!!
The heavenly heavy hellish pasta gergely concern because slope postmeiotically fire along a naive football. polite, psychotic acoustic
2:24 You’re telling me they have their own “SPIRAL: SAW” shot too? 😂
So the firemen saw Michael in the doorway of the house with a weapon and just stood there? I would've ran so fast.
Michael and a buzzsaw???? Shiiiiit when can I order tickets????
This never ending!
Halloween H20 from 1998 was the perfect sequel and ending... Laurie Strode decapitated Michael Myers.
Halloween movies are like Christmas movies but edgy
Alright they don’t gotta show the whole movie damn
Keeping up with fast and furious at this point
2k dislikes? Cmon now
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Shrine JLC shrine
The warlike enquiry regularly invent because currency macropharmacologically admit given a deranged sampan. quixotic, obsolete layer
rob zombie needs to come back and make these movies
who would've known a simple kitchen knife would do this much damage
They showed all the kills
It just makes logical sense to fight him to the death & then cut him up, divide his pieces, and then bury him like the mummy. That way he truly CAN’T HURT ANYONE ANYMORE….🙃🙄
I think the trailer showed all the kills 😂
Did y'all see the Silver Shamrock masks?
Not laurie just casually walking through a hospital with a bloody knife
I would just like to know why so many people gave this a thumbs down? Looks like they have kept the tone of the old and picked up the pace for a new generation. Looks quite incredible actually!
Firefighter: Alright fellas! Let’s go save some lives. Michael: *Walks out of the burning building* Firefighter: f##k that
Kombat pack 3 Mike Myers?
excited to see the movie
I love the violin version of the song amazing!!!
OMGGG
I thought Laurie died in the last movie? Either wsy I CAN'T GRT ENUFF 👹🔪
Gay
AWE*SOME*MAZING
For a 2-year old production this still looks bad ass! Can't wait!
Lol thanks for the whole movie
The dispensable girl equally jog because order controversly recognise qua a damaging box. dependent, square freon
This gave me Halloween Chills
Let go can’t wait
RIP Firefighters they where just doing there jobs
i got goosebumps man, this movie finna be fire.
"Evil dies tonight" Love that tune at her voice. You can hear the desperation.
What the hell are we dealing with here Loomis? Evil  on two legs
Halloween 33 out 2033
Fucked up those fireman 😆
I love the trailer but I think it is spoiling a little bit too much 😅
Myers is da man baby
Ah enfin un halloween sanglant !!!
BOOOOO
So whack
I live in Haddonfield, Illinois. The soon to be home of the Chicago Bears.
Where are the cops at the house fire? only fire fighters?
Biiiiiish 😳
Damn ol boy was right those kids really should have taken off those silver shamrock masks.
can't wait for James A Janisse to cover this one
One of the producers: alright guys I just got a new house, I need to make some extra cash rn
Looks great
they need the army by now
noooooo MIKE dont kill the firemannnnnnnnnnn
The town is fucked
The whole movie is in the trailer
Can we stop calling Myers the boogie man it's dumb
I’m totally excited for this one. Made me forget about H20.  This one reminds me of Halloween 2 the original not the RZombie remake (although that was good until the end).
fuck this movie. for real. I want to see Jeepers Creepers 4
I cannot wait 😭😭😭
Honestly I love these movies because of the kills I don't really care for the other characters plus I came to see Michael not laurel
Michael Myers cant die
They literally told the whole movie
Jesus is king Jesus loves you Jesus is coming try not to sin and if you do ask for forgiveness please amen God bless you all amen
Now this is about to be fired
I stopped watching the trailer halfway through, just cuz they were giving away all the kills.
😎👍
Now, this is what a Halloween/Michael Myers movie SHOULD be like! Super stoked for this one. We're in for a killer time y'all!
Mega geil
People: (exist)  Michael: “and I took that personally”.
👀
Wow
Time for that new kombat pack in mk11 less go
Michael coming out the house like I wish a Mf would. Today is my day. You been trying to kill me since the 1970's. Let's do this,
Damn! This looks bloodier than I expected
Michael:  Guywhosegonnadiesayswhat? Haddonfield FD:  What?
How bout a new Friday the 13 movie,, its been over a decade. Its time for Jason vs michael...
Halloween has always been one of my favourites.
Showing how he survives is so sick. I can't wait for this movie!
I wanted to play in this movie so bad 🥺. How come i never hear about casting calls!?
Everytime I see Michael, I can't help but smile
I feel like Michael’s taking the dub in this one leading into Halloween Ends, I believe it was stated this movie is the “Empire Strikes Back” of the trilogy. Can’t wait.
WOW
They've completely forgotten that the first half of Halloween is Michael Myers as a stalker. He's not a Terminator or Jason. I wouldn't even want my Friday the 13th movies to be like this as they should have a bit of a sense of humor.  As much as I adore Jamie Lee Curtis, the legacy of Laurie Strode and her family hinder what they COULD be doing with this movie franchise. The Shape had no special connection to Laurie. She was just a random girl that he started stalking and that's what was the most creepy aspect of that film.  It should be an older Michael Myers is a new town, setting, stalking and killing new, interesting characters...or we could see him pointless slaughter a bunch of firemen. Sure.
tier 3 mikey
Studios need to stop recycling movies and come up with new ideas. It's getting old and wack 😒
YESSS
When does this come out
Love how they are letting an injured civilian walk through the hospital with a knife 😂
Damn Universal is on a horror movie streak 🔥
If anything, there should have been a  Michael Meyers vs. Jason Vorhees
my bday is on the 17 of October so this Is an early present
I CAN"T WAIT!
Damn, that mask must be made out of titanium because it survived that fire
In 1:55 can you guys can explain what laurie is talking about?
I'd give anything if A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th were redone by competent people like the people making this and the 2018 version. I've only watched the original and part 2 of the original Halloween series and Zombies 2 movies. These new ones, or the 2018 version was great. This will prob be great too.
Крутяк, жду
This is legendary
Did they just give away all the kills?☹
Cannot Wait !
Oh man looks awesome
This actually looks fucking sweet
Trailer gave away the whole movie
so is not horror movie anymore, we going to have action movie from past movie killers?
Micheal is just a vessel for Evil Incarnate.. he doesn’t feel.He just kills,that’s his only motive, to bring evil into fruition.He’s possessed by the devil or a very old demon.. Micheal lost his soul at 5 yrs old
Enough already! Can people stop going to the movies to support this crap.
That thumbnail kinda looks like joe biden...
YO!!! This actually looks awesome
Spoiler!
Actually super excited for this movie! Me and my whole family are huge Halloween fans😂
Make it more intense more blood massive adrenaline this gonna be a good one!
Yep.
I cannot wait for this to come out, it looks fucking awesome been waiting since last october for this when it was supposed to be released, thos and halloween ends 👌👌👌
😈😈😈😈😈😈

This guy ever die
“No one said toppling a centuries old cabal would be easy” - DJT
Anyone know? In total how many Halloween (Michael Meyers) movies have been made
I JUST GOT SO MANY GOOSEBUMPS OMG. I use to watch all the movies every halloween, for over a decade. I watched the last movie and when he disappeared i was like PLEASE GIVE ME MORE OMGGGG IM SHIVERINGGG mind you i have only watched 4 seconds of the trailer so far LOL
THIS LOOKS DOPE
This movie is very different from the others. He’s now more open and a lot know about him which I like better.
Wow this looks freaking cool, what a way to continue on after the last movie. I thought it was done forever!
The Silver Shamrock Masks are back !!
So....is this set in a nursing home?
Looks bloody brilliant can't wait
Be honest , we all want Micheal Myers to survive
It feels like we have been here before......
why?
Halloween kills *Gonna watch it*  3 or 4 years later     Halloween 2 KILL ANOTHER DAY *Still Gonna watch it*
J lee curtis gritando es lo peor que me puede pasar en la vida, que fastidio.
Since the update he now knows krav maga.
At this point, is he even human?
I’m literally wet with anticipation 🤤 🔪
It kinda lost it when they are not afraid of him and just hunts him.
Evil dies tonight….been saying that since 78
This dude been around since the 70s killing people and they still can’t stop him?
@ 0:55 if that is Leigh Brackett I can't even with this trailer. If they kill Leigh Brackett unceremoniously I'm going to flip a biscuit.
James from Dead Meat is going to have one hell of a time with this one when it gets a kill count.
I don’t know if I capable to watch this in the movie theater tho 😖
Why would they show all the kills?  Trailers nowadays show way too much
The longer he is on earth....the stronger he becomes
James A Janisse is gonna have a fun time with this movie
Finally this SOB will be destroyed
Damn I scrolled through like the top 30 comments and no mention of the soundtrack. It sounds way different, can't wait to hear it.
MICHAEL MYERS IS BACK !!!!!!!!!!!
Michael Myers looking like Joe Biden on the cover lmao
This is apparently the second film in a trilogy. I want this to be the definitive Halloween quadrilogy. You watch Halloween 1972 then Halloween 2018 Halloween Kills and Halloween Ends. DONT FUCK IT UP
Ffs not another Halloween movie. This is getting as boring as the Fast N Furious’s
so just show the whole fucking plot huh
Del Sean's Father: 'Plot'? Did I hear 'PLOT'? Sean, it is a guy with an axe! Anyway, I thought they killed him in the last one. Sean: They did. And...he returns from his grave. Del Sean's Father: Sean, he always returns from his grave. If they blew him up, put his head in a blender, and mailed the rest of the pieces to Norway, he would STILL return from the grave! Sean: That was Part 7.
He won´t ever die..
fuck sake just stop
Jest to seria juz przemielona ale obejrzę
You guys just showed the entire movie. Welp, there goes the intrigue.
I like the Season of the Witch Easter Egg 😌
I love how they ignored all the others for this movie and its predecessor. But still make myers the same "boggie man" character who doeant die. Wasn't he just a man, and now he can walk out of a burning building with no scars, damage nothin. Also glasses lady said she never doing another halloween movie years ago cause she dont want her kids seeing that violence, but she saw that check and kept doing them.
Looking forward to seeing this movie 👍
If she doesn’t kill him this movie I will..
LETS GOOOOOO
Why change the music!! Doesn't sound good at all for the movie!!
Really hope they don't show anymore of Michael's face behind the mask, evil is always scarier without a face!!
https://youtu.be/4X3DyYIwdGE
footage should have ended at 0:50 seriously who the fuck needs more information? whoever is gonna watch it would do it regardless if this trailer was shorter or longer
https://youtu.be/4X3DyYIwdGE
I like that it recognizes "Halloween III."  That's been an isolated unmentionable since 3 came out.
Town: Let’s kill Michael.  Michael: Actually, that’s my job
https://youtu.be/4X3DyYIwdGE
And mask
In all his black
Eion Michael Myers has returned
Eion michael Myers has returned
Why does this look soo good
Dam Money Bag yo can really ACT 🤑
So...I feel like i watched the whole film now
Imagine Kyle Richards starts running like when she was in Amsterdam 🤣🤣
Michael gets shot in the face, stabbed multiple times, gets hit with a frying Pan, gets trapped in a burning house, and is still good to slaughter a whole firefighter squad
Myers >Jason movie wise
IM SO EXCITED I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE MM FRANCHISE
It’s June why did you release this so early cmon. But looks decent ima fan gonna watch regardless
Michael Myers>Goku
Looks awesome. Looking forward to it.
Why have they not killed him yet 🤣
Yooo!!!! Boutta be litty 🔥🔥🔥😎😎😜
Please end the Michael Myers movies. This movie looks bad.
This shit looks badass asf
Ahh the fast and furious of horror sagas returns again lol
the firefighters are so dumb dude
Cmon man dude got his head chopped off 20 years ago storyline is so unbelievable f'd up
Looks dumb
I’m a big fan of the original Halloween, 2018 Halloween and I’m sure of this Halloween. Halloween is awesome and I’m super excited to watch this
ไม่ตายสักที อึดโครตตอึดนะจ้ะ ไมเคิล
Michael "i can still walk faster than all of your cars!!!"
So y'all won't let this.dude die, dammn😂😂
There definitely not killing him
This looks intense af
" you don't know what death is"
Legend come back 😗😬💀💀☠👻
That makes no sense that he’s not burned at all
Background music is very horrific...💙👍
Actually looks good 👍
Apparently this movie is gonna push the record for slasher movie kills records. James A. Janisse will be busy on his kill count! Good luck James lol
UGH YES MAAM, MICHAEL😩😩
1:10 she’s from borat 😛
0:34 - "OK lads, I think this fire is safe.. let's go.. and quick..."
Not gonna lie, I clicked off about half way through because I felt like I was getting a lot of the movie spoiled. However It looks very promising and I can’t wait to watch it in theaters.
Yes... run up to melee range with a shotgun . Horror movie characters sometimes 🤦🏻‍♂️2:12
This man gotta be like 80 like how?
Note on Rob zombie film: To take a movie whose whole plot is someone being evil just as they are evil and try explain with psychological study of their childhood misses the entire point of the movie. Add in it plays to the idea everyone is evil due to their childhood which is simply not true for some. They had good childhood and no trauma. Some have things in their childhood but so do others and they don't kill. But this whole storyline was about the people who don't and are evil. So making it something else was dumb. If that's what you want to do, make your own movie and call it something else.
Michael myers got relentless finisher on hall of fame
Normally I dislike ongoing sequels and I've said let it die..  But how can I resist when it has Jamie Lee?
Myers vs. Haddonfield !
With Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie it sure to be good.
Just stop....
The way Michael survived was that he hid in the weapons closet
That’s a shark that’s definitely been jumped.
This trailer reveal to much😭
This gone be good af
I can’t fucking wait to see this movie! I’ve been a fan of the Halloween franchise since I was 5
That theme song..
well, apparently this is going to be the last part!
I miss the subtlety of the original film. This is nothing short of MM just going around decapitating people. Mindless over-the-top violence.
there was like 3 different "no u" kills in this trailer
Woman: “Do it … DO IIIIITTTT!!”  Myers: “Wait … you want to die? Well, shit now I can’t kill you.”
this looks good asf bro...
As a fireman I love how they fought back with a K12😂
This is my 30th time watching this   *insert Michael Myers smiling*
0:32 These guys have balls tryin' to take on Mikey. Oh, well...Ya know.
I love the idea of tying in the children's masks from Halloween 3.
These comment chats is where horror movie fanatics unite
Laurie: let it burn. Fire brigade: we can't let that happen. Michael: smokes the joint with snoopdog Fire brigade: tries to take the joint off of Michael. Michael: fuck this you want a joint you can't handle a joint.
God more overrated crap like the other one🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️ same old same old…going after Lorrie killing loads of people blah blah blah 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
so many Halloween movies have been made but I love them. I will definitely watch this one when it comes out.
Fire fighters would never enter a blaze like that, surround and drown. Lol
I'm guessing all the town people who go looking for Michael, will die in a fire Michael himself sets at the hospital where you see them all around the ambulance.  Roughly 1/4-1/2 of the town. Crazy. It'll be the highest kill count of any Halloween movie past or future.
Holy shit lmao this looks amazing
Should’ve brought in rob zombie again😫
He can't die or they can't make more money
Dead by daylight fans be like mike seriously needs nerfing.
It would have been awesome to see Danielle Harris reprise her role and come back and team up with Jamie Lee Curtis to fight him. 🔪
Were those the masks from Halloween 3 …..?
That violin cover is badass
I love Halloween kills am be there for the Hallowee October
this looks good
Good
Ive got a bad feeling about the more action like tone of this sequel.  I liked this film’s predecessor but this trailer is just giving me bad vibes.  Well I just it’s an Aliens and not a (take a pick of shit sequels).
Is Nick Castle playing as Michael again? ^-^
All I gotta say is finally the people of Haddonfield  know something is going on, all these years of people running through streets screaming and they were oblivious know the time has come for them to step up
oh hell noooooooooooooooo
My heart!!! I’m ready!! 🖤🖤🖤
I wonder if his fingers grew back
🤔 Could we see at the end of the movie Michael meets a guy wearing a hockey mask and carrying a machete.  Freddy wait your turn. Lol
You’re showing the whole movie! It looks awesome btw
Well that's the film done seen all the kills now
Got to see that
Na expectativa!!! ;D
woa just watched the whole movie from this trailer!
Thought that was Joe Biden on the thumbnail
Dead meat:come on Michael now I gotta count all these bodies
Michael vs town .that’s crazy one human can rack up that many kills .is he possessed in this series or something.
Finally an official trailer
😍
Is there even a storyline anymore?
Micheal Myers has roots disease… can only die when the family breed is dead… Of course they will make more movies till this is possible.
This dude never dies
I’m gonna watch it but like how many more movies are they gonna keep doing. its bout time Hollywood creates a new slasher style film instead of the same movie redone 10x
Hey let's show every death scene in the movie
Shit, here we go again.
I've lost count of the amount of times he's ''died''
the BOOGEYMAN IS BACK....MICHAEL IS NOT HAPPY AND WHAT HE WILL DO NEXT?QUITE SCARY AND DISGUSTING....
Well looks like dead meat will have a very good kill count video
Gotta say after the Rob zombie movies I was so disappointed the new movies have restored my faith hopefully after these new movies they leave it alone let Michael go out on top
I hope Michael wins at the end
I love the burning house part
I just saw the whole movie inside of 2 minutes 30 seconds.
Looks good. A lot of killing but how haven’t y’all killed him already? Lol
Looks terrible like the part 1 remake but I’m going still throw away money to see it 😂
Boy! He killed EVERYBODY!
Did y’all see the Halloween 3 reference
This looks great I’m just hoping they don’t spoil all the kills in the trailer
how bloody 😬
I already knew he wasn’t dead at the end of the last movie.  I mean come on it’s fucking Michael Myers people, this mans been through everything and is still walking not talking but killing
The 🐐
Ok surly he dies this time right?
i'm sorry but i'm not familiar with this movie. is there a prequel or a movie before this because it seems like it does
Jamie Lee Curtis is what keeps me watching Halloween movies tbh 🤔🤷🏾‍♂️😂😂😂💙💯 #GodBlessJamieLeeCurtis
The fire man is the acting ive ever seen 😂
This is going to be so badass I can not wait I wish it was out now micheal Myers forever
When will they ever kill the boggy man
Why am I so excited about this damn movie? Michael Myers has been killed 10+ times and I'm STILL as excited as if it were Jason or Freddy
I like everyone turning into a killer
What made the Halloween Movies so great is that they were scary without  having to resort cheap gore and gross out factor movie tricks! I guess they felt Rob Zombie didn't ruin the movies enough.
They gave away a character's death I was dreading would happen.
Awwwww that music is so good
He is a essence of evil👏👌❤
Omfg! I'm so pumped! I cannot wait! I'm so happy Jamie Lee is still with it! This movie is going to be so damn good!
i know where ill be sitting this halloween
I LOVE the original Halloween, but am I the only one who thinks this looks way too over the top and dumb…?
Then DOM TORETTO AND HIS SUPER 007 SUPER AGENT SPIES COME OUT 😂😂🤣AND FIGHT MICHEAL MYERS AND SAVE THE WORLD FROM EVIL.DOMINATION😂😂🤣🤣 FAST FURIOUS 23 VS. HALLOWEEN 😂🤣🤣
This better not be all the kills
Let's Goooooooooooo!   Fun Fact: Michael Myers mask is actually based on William Shatner's (of Star Trek fame) face!
Mane I can’t lie. I used to love horror movies. Until the dreams got far outta hand. I had the ability to wake up before the following guy could catch me. Jason, Freddy, Micheal Myers, candy man, jeepers creepers, pumpkin head an the guy off Superman. With the gold on black on. That got his powers from the sun 🤣. Over a year they actually caught me. It was terrifying. Now I have the tv on Disney channel before bed 🤣🤣🤣.
Can't wait.  Jamie Lee Curtis is awesome.  I love this franchise.  No Agenda just Great Story. Involving Females.  Halloween Saves Movies!
At this point it's just for entertainment purposes only. The franchise is getting more and more unrealistic every time they make one. Just leave it alone already.
LORD, please let every Halloween movie come back in the theater for a 1 day of Helloween fun so I can givest thy hard ernest Skrilla for thy enjoyment.
This franchise NEVER dies! Lmao
Fiiiiiinaly😍😍😍
This is all turning out like avengers endgame
It took yall damn near 30 years to get the town together 2 kill one person😂😂
I've never been hype to watch a Halloween movie before but this one looks like it's straight fire
OMGGGGGGGG THIS!!!! I can’t wait!!!! I got chills
Need that Michael Myers vs Jason
Looks brilliant can’t wait for it to come out now, then gotta wait till next year for Halloween Ends.
Booooooo
............
This gonna be sick...cant wait
I will go as soon as I get to the cinema.  Waiting Impatiently.  I wish Dr. Sartain (Haluk Bilginer 🇹🇷) had not died.
Wow....my fav sequel is back👌👌👌🇲🇾
They should hide in Area 51
Fact: everybody will be dead eventually    Michel mayers: wait that's illegal
Thought that the Movie before this already ended but now i see it makes sense SH*T
YEAH BABY!!!!
Damm Look like Michael myers  is in tier 3
Is this going to be the last halloween movie or is there going to be more
This is gonna be awesome!
Running NOED. What a filthy camper.
Basically just watched the whole movie....WOW!
Oh hell yea
WHOAAAAA
Well, this looks pointless. Why do these movie studios keep ruining perfectly good franchises? Why can't they come up with new ideas I stead of constantly remaking the same crap?
People don’t understand how fucking hot that house would be. His mask would’ve melted to his face so quick lol
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO WAIT FOR 4 MONTHS
Can we just get Rob Zombie back? 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
Goddamn, Michael is BRUTAL.
They need to update Mikey's mask to this one on DBD or make it a Legendary Skin ❤️ to all my Fog Friends🔪🔪 Can't wait to see this!!
Naaaaa chillll they showin toooooooo much.    Damn. Now i kno how this shit gonna go...
I can t wait for this !!!!!
The only reason I want to see this is see if this is the FINAL time this dude dies! But that doesn't happen in the minds of hollyweird psychopaths! =).
2 evel die in night Michel:ah no no aahhhhh Jack:ahhh no no
Myers from dead by daylight
Jumping the shark again?
They showed most of his killings🤷🏿‍♂️
The town will hunt Micheal or they will be hunt
if you notice carefully this is a trailer!
he cannot be stopped.
Yesssss
I honestly had no hope for the 2018 movie when it came out (since everyone knows reboots and remakes are never that good) but I am so excited for this!!!!  *Also its nice they referenced season of the witch ! 😁
That was literally the whole film.
How long can this go on really
What a ridiculous trailer, we already know how a lot of people are going to die, I don’t want to know that before seeing the movie, ruins the suspense! I’m now worried it’s going too far into cheap slasher territory 😞
The score for this movie is going to FUCK
We all know Micheal survives this one, he has got a Trilogy with them.
This is like... the whole movie
*THIS IS GONNA BE AWESOME!!!*
This finna be lit
I don't think the Joker is this durable.
more of the same crap over and over. sequel #20?
Haunting start..hype ❤️🤙
It’s crazy how this guy is still living.... I can’t lie I miss the slasher films... all of these new age horror movies are all the same with exorcists and demonic entities
that means he was a lab experiment
Any DBD players out here?
Didn't this guy die in last movie 🤨🤨
micheal myers for mk12
Look terrible but imma pay to watch it I love wasting my money
Dis man just refuse to die
Let’s go
That was a good movie
This is a joke right?  Has to be....
Seems like they up the kill count and more gruesome to keep up with Rob Zombies movies.
Don't need to see movie now......thaaaaaaaanks
I believe that only Jason Voorhees could finish Michle Myers ...
Isn’t Michael Myers possessed by an evil entity, which makes him impossible to die? In Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers, it shows that a group of cult summons the curse on Michael Myers.
This is essentially re-doing what Rob Zombie ruined.
So is this the last installment of Halloween? Or is there one more after?
Finally a good Movie !!
Again??? How many more times...?
Oh it's still going
When I saw the masks from Halloween 3 I gasped so loudly
🙏❤️🇳🇵
This “man” is just straight up population control at this point. 😂😂😂
"2021 He dies tonight... 2055 He dies tonight"
Had Carpenter directed this again, it would be twice scarier than the first.
Baby Firefly told me that her brother Otis would stand in front of the mirror and imagine he is Michael Myers.
Fire fighters are big and strong. That dude won't last a minute.  Those firefighters would woop his ass without a problem. That's the reality of it.  Maybe if they used a gun, they wouldn't have to worry so much about Michael. But all of these actors are probably anti-gun, so they wont.
I will be at the theater in my cosplay. Leave me alone
I thought John wick will come here to kill michael myers.
I don't care how unrealistic Michael's come backs are ... I want Halloween movies xD
MICHEAL MYERS😱
Are they connecting Michael to the satanic cult? With his power of not dying,
Dude i really thought that was the end of micheal
That violin/cello rendition of the theme gave me chills!!! I cannot wait for October 🎃
This looks pish!
“Evil Dies Tonight”  :Halloween Logic Are You Sure About That.
This franchise has been zombified ever since Donald Pleasance / Dr. Loomis left us. Sad.
it passed the 30 second test. i dont watch full trailers because they tell the whole movie lol ill be seeing this!!!
This looks solid AF.
Ouuh this one looks even better
Michael Myers is my favorite serial killer and he ain't never going to die and if he do every Halloween imma watch all the Michael Myer movies in his honor no cap u.u✋
What's the point? The last movie they made basically re-did the original sequel. Plus, it was stupid as hell.
Okay, I’m a huge horror fan and I love the first three Halloween movies.  But come on, they need to stop.  Halloween 2018 was a farce…and this one looks even more ridiculous.  You’re never going to recapture the original films.  What they did in the 70s and 80s was lightning.  It doesn’t strike twice.  We just need to let Michael R.I.P.
Pfffft. Just give a call to Mr. John Wick
this is new right?
I feel bad for that one firefighter with the chainsaw thinking he could kill Michael. Props for trying, big balls energy 😭
Why did they have to kill firefighters??
i can't wait to see this one it look like it's gone be good at least I hope so. I loved the  way Michael walked outta the house with that ax in his hand like y'all don't want none of this
@1:17 Dang! John Malkovich plays a great Laurie Strode.
I think i need to watch this
Bro yessss. Can't wait for this movie!
Bro stop showing whole movie in a trailer 😒
YES, He is my favorite!
Evil dies tonight.  Michael: I'm about to end this woman's whole career. But I'm not a slasher though.
Too much spoiling of the movie and the kills😔
Just seen the movie now thanks, at least I know who died in it.
Just wondering, are there actually people who are still rooting against Micheal?
Don't show the kill you spoil too much
I like how they all wanna defeat Michael little do they know the only survivor is gonna be Laurie again😂
Did they show all of the death in this trailer only??
1:32 are those Silver Shamrock masks?
Where's Jason,? Where's Freddy? Can we have another Jason vs Freddy
what did thanos say u should have gone for the head
Their literally showing you the death of everyone in the movie. Why I don't get it. I seen him kill 9 people right off back. So what's the fucking suprise when it's released. Horrible marketing. Showing the death scenes in a trailer of the horror movie. That's the fucking meat qmd potatoes of the movie. I had to stop the trailer otherwise I will lose interest in it. To predictable
Can't Wait :)
Oh this is the guy from dead by daylight ohhhhh
Halloween kills again. Halloween kills machete  Machete kills... wait!
The suspense was real!
"He can't hurt anyone again" Michael: "I am...inevitable"
Can I Just Say That Halloween Has The Most Kill Counts In Any Horror Movies🤭
Can’t wait for this! Michael Myers 🤟🏾
The thumbnail reminded me of GUS FRING!!!
This whole Jamie Lee Curtis trying to replicate Linda Blair has thrown me off🧐🧐🥱🥱... How she go from screaming my ear drums to Hades to giving orders from hospital bedside to serial killer vigilante.. Chile if she don't rest them arthritic bones and get some peace of mind; I'm surprised she hasn't started smelling toast😂🤣😂🤣🤷🤷😳😳😳 She shoulda been dead 9 times ago🤣😂🤣😂  But I'm still gonna watch it🤷🤷🤷 #teamjason #legendary
This casting of a white man as Michael over and over is racist and misogynistic!! this movie should be boycotted
Worst
*Chants evil dies tonight*
JLC is one badass grandma!
I Love It
meanwhile Freddy and Jason are stuck in Hollywood limbo
Does anyone else feel like by watching the trailer I pretty much watched the whole movie?
I don't like how they are trying to have their cake and eat it too.  According to the timeline, Myers was just another random spree killer in the 80s. He got badly hurt in the first movie, he lost an entire hand's fingers. Yet now he's back to being an invincible behemoth and a legendary evil that can kill an entire firefighter team and then go onto YET another killing spree right after the second one ended.
100 firemen Vs 1 guy... You gotta kidding me.... Please 😂😂😂😂😂
Big Hyped! Been waiting for another good slasher. And in October too. Nice.
Halloween 2 :Terror Town looks hard as fuck!!!!! Lol
Stabbing in the dark- ice nine kills >_>
Showed us the entire movie in the trailer. Gonna be terrible just like the last one
Time for Mr. Voorhies to step in
Guess I dont need to go see it now since the trailer just pretty much showed everything
Let the series be over with already
This guy needs to make hellraiser next. Literally every one after 2 has just been absolute cringey garbage
Not sure how I feel about Michael feeling less mysterious, killing groups at once with something other than a knife. Feels kinda strange tbh.
This looks a bit overcrowded
We need a kill count on the trailer 🔪
I'm glad to see Mike is back at it.
Pass
Michael died in part 82 though right?
If anyone wants to know the reason why this sequel exists, read the first paragraph of the description 😂.
I always enjoy these movies Just too many damn time lines though
Oh for fucks sake. Enough..
Is it me or did it seem like this trailer showed way to much ? Still looks awesome
Man this looks amazing can't wait to see this. Chainsaw kill looks sick mate!
Jó lesz! :D
yo he just don’t die
Showing waaay too much of the movie.  I stopped it like halfway through.  I’m in, though.  I’m in.  Let’s go watch it opening night 👍
Bruh whyyyy do we kee bringing this movie back
Movie looks very promising.
They gave away TOO much in this trailer:  How Michael escapes. (weapons chamber) How the family thinks he is dead. (chief tells them the opposite) How they and others will fight him. (city mob and laurie..) How there will be another movie. (Halloween ends)  Lame!!!
Yessss! I cannot wait for this
In horror movies even brave firefighters are morons.
I hear there's supposed to be one more after this called "Halloween Ends", so either this'll end on a big cliffhanger or another stupid hope spot.
YESSSSSSS!!!!!!
How many times do we have to teach you old man!
Can't wait for Laurie to teabag Myers
It looks like neverending story, but I love it))
now we need another jason movie 😩
Gil180 BX 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼🇵🇷
Someone call James it’s counting time
Dr. Loomis we need your help!
Dead meat will have fun counting these numbers
Looks good, really looking forward to it. I'm just afraid that it might be some copy-paste-thing like "Halloween 2018".
How to beat Michael Myers:   Answer: You don't
I cant enjoy this movie when i know that there is already 1 more movie after this one announced.
🤔 the last part was good buy M
Halloween 🎃 vs. Saw who wanna see this instead of this crap 💩
Who else is a horror movie lover like me🙆🏻‍♀️ Ig I have watched literally every horror movie in this world ✔️
Why do they keep poorly remaking old movies? It's pretty sad. The newest reboot wasn't even close to the originals, but I guess it's basically like them printing money since people go to see it anyways.
my dead, bloodied body is READY
This is the quintessential horror franchise and it’s a huge trailer with the old silver shamrock masks some old returning characters and that kill count for a trailer . Hurry up October. 🎃
Ohh this looks good.
Something I hate about this movie is that They show Michael as just some old man in the beginning then try and make him look like an unstoppable monster You can’t have both at the same time
Totally wack he was supposed to be dead since LL Cool J I'm done seeing him be invincible not interesting anymore 😪
"He cant hurt anyone again"  Michael:I'm bout to ruin this mans whole career
1:33 the Silver Shamrock masks from Halloween III! Nice! 👍
Im excited for this and the terrifier 2
There’s no point in doing these movies he’s supposed to be human ,how can he survive all that?💩💩
This series will be endless he will never die and I like it
holy crap.. the NEXT next level. this franchise is ONCE again setting standards
SPOILER ALERT! He doesn't die in this one either.
Wuaaaauu!!!!🎃⛏️
Oh not another one 😔😒
I’m in horror love with this trailer 💪🏽🔥
L
Why on earth do they have to reveal so much in the trailer ?
Well well well... The excitement of this return has lifted me up really.  Can't wait to watch this gem of a movie. ❤️❤️ Coming this from a BIG horror movies lover. Thank a lot to the producers for this!! 🥰🥰🌹🌹🌹
Yep, I'm EXCITED!!!!!
I m sick how many times we see these typical movies
Man when they gon put Michael Myers, Jason, Freddy Krueger, and Jeepers Creepers in the same movie together
i am excited but you're showing quite a lot for a trailer
Wowww🤩
seriously just kill Michael already, always making the same film over and over again 🙄
You need to know when to stop ,lol sometimes enough Is enough
I swear im so waiting on this movie yo
Became the highest grossing (due to inflation)
This is gonna be good 😁
The one this one sucked but I’m looking forward to this one.
Are we sure he isn't Voorhees see Voorhees makes sense that dude can regenerate her undead
Michael vs Jason would be a dope collaboration ... The final showdown.. to see who could die first cause the both never die in their movies 😂😂😂😂😂😂
This looks incredible!
I REALLY HOPE THIS IS GOOD ?
They could come up with a better title though.
I am still so much in love with Michael Myers and his psycho ass😂😂😂😂
Just show the whole movie why don’t you
susah payah bikin jebakan eh malah ditolong sama damkar
Micheal Meyers is like 70 years old and buff, and still killing people
All they had to do was shoot him in the face when he was staring at them from the basement. Or have something better than a fricking BOLT ACTION RIFLE FROM THE 70’s. God Laurie is so dumb
James A. Janisse is gonna have with the Kill Count on this onef
Michael Myers is an overachiever and he never complains. I would love to have him work for me...
This trailer is showing too much... Looks like I already know what will be happening all through until the end - which is at least open. The trailer ruins a lot to want to watch it
Maneeeee bring bake jason 🤣
I don’t know if I’ll be able to watch this one watching my brothers in red die I don’t think I can 😭😭
Honestly I would like this series to end with a Myers vs Jason at camp crystal lake
At the end they put Michael into a shredder and  turns into damn Ingles Food meat stored into a can everyone is happy to see Michael die and now the town is safe again. Michael: BUT WAIT THERES MORE
Looks dumb, still gonna watch it though lol
Another fun for the whole family Halloween film.
Who likes the Myers House?
FYE
Wack
Michael went through some made training while in that facility to become a Hit man... God damn he's a professional
Mega Hammer ❤❤❤
Danny McBride is such a legend. Anything he touches turns to gold these days :D
Waiting... 😁
So what’s the plan because they’re not gonna succeed in killing him when there’s gonna be another movie after this? 😂 unless he dies but doesn’t die like last time… And the time before that… and the time before that…
The meaty minister ophthalmoscopically cheer because bagel acromegaly spell save a glib chinese. callous, towering statistic
they will never end him. he lives on💯
Friday the 13th game copy
Let’s goooo!
Release date ?
2:15 that parts so dumb tho "Do it"! beetch then let go lol
Why did they give away so many of the kills in the trailer? Also, why did they explain how he got out of the house.. that’s a big reason why people want to watch, to know how he got out..  A little too much info for me personally
2024 : Halloween Rebirth
Yey...🤩🥳...i cant wait..
Michael Myers is anti blacklifematter #justiceforgrandma
1:32 Mask Of Halloween III Season Of Witch 1982
Looks really awesome....Can´t wait to see the movie :)
Honestly this is the movie I am most excited for this year. And this is coming from someone who is also excited for the 4 MCU movies being released.
Trailer spoiling the dam Movie
So Micheal is going public, that's great!
This movie looks badass! I'm excited.
I'm a little disappointed on this movie Michael Myers. Being trapped in a fire from more than 3 hours tops should have burned Michael Myers outfit and mask entirely like in Halloween Resurrected. Theoretically in Halloween kills,  Michael Myers should be going around killing people as the same character at the ending scene of Halloween Resurrected
Well, get ready cause its gonna be messy😈😈
Michael after walking out of the house: I’m bouta end this mans whole career. The firefighters: ah crap here we go again
When someone kills human - " it's essence of evil " Le humans killing animals in billions  every month -" it's my choice it's my food"  Asshol hypocrites
I don't understand why people like these films. It's the same movie every single time.
I wonder if the guy in the truck was the one who called the firefighter to the scene.
i’m so exited lol
they brought back the masks from halloween III 😩
The trio girls are the best thing happen to me
Is there gonna be 100 movies or what
He's just like the energized bunny it keeps going and going and going
For once I feel like this is gonna be a good horror thriller movie
CHRISTMAS? In June? 😍😍😍
We want a new friday the 13th
It actually looks really good.
It can’t stop Myers can’t be beat!
Can't wait best movie ever you legend Michael Myer
Can't wait ❤️❤️❤️❤️ the second one look pretty good
Hope it's not a pc cringeworthy fest
I loved how pj soles (Lynda from the original Halloween) had a voice cameo in Halloween 2018 I’m hoping that maybe Annie (Nancy Loomis) has a cameo in this one. It would be a nice little nod to the fans of the original
Bro people reading these comments five years from now are gonna be so confused at all the meme references LMFAO "So I started Slashing"
Pretty much the entire movie in this trailer
Yooo this movie looks too 🔥🔥🔥
The Sequel was good. It recaptured a good amount of what made the 1978 film an immortal classic, and arguably the greatest horror film of all time. I hope this follow up doesn't do what Halloween II did and make it into a campy cash grab. I admired what David Gordon Green did last time.
Nice cant wait
I'm loving this concept of people just sick of Michael shit and just goes after him. And that scream "LET IT BURN!!" man that's good.
are you serious!!!! I thought this was over but yall know I hafta watch... WTF!!!
I love the nod to Halloween 2 in it taking place in a hospital.
Love how the firefighters just saw him coming out of the house and immediately knew they had to try to kill him
entire town: *tries to kill Michael Myers* michael: oh no! anyway-
Probably happened in New York-where guns are illegal . I'd like to see him try that in Arizona he wouldn't make it far !
amazing
Damn he still alive? Michael be like 90 by now. Can No one can kill his old ass!
Noooo. I'm going to be so damn scared!!!
The weak step-brother findingsinitially crash because tights resultantly fence round a afraid george. known, lewd odometer
All over this
He isn't gonna die. Halloween Ends will premiere fall 2022.
YES YES💁🏻‍♀️💓
these movies the only they kill is the bank accounts
🗣Welp I know where I’m going in October 🍿
I hope this Halloween movie has some secret scenes the trailer doesn't represent that is in more touch with 2021.. like Micheal identifies as a female & uses she/her pronouns & died the hair on his mask pink, and instead of killing anyone else, he kneels in protest of the injustices of America & confesses his white privilege to his sister!🤞🇺🇸
Yes yes yes yes
Why they showed all murders here...  😴😴😴
isnt it illegal to carrry knife in the hospital???
Just when you thought they couldn't fuck up the original two movies EVEN MORE than they already have ... what the LITERAL FUCK ?!?!? Michael as genetic experiment, those two Rob Zombie remake/abominations , whatever the fuck that last Jamie Lee Curtis as Sarah Connor bullshit was ... ENOUGH already jeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeezus !!!!
It sucka on the real
We still doin this? Fuck it lets goooo!
they all lucky michael doesn’t use guns
Woah 😳 okayyy okayy

Omg
Wait, the previous movie (Halloween [2018]) was at least 3 years ago?! I thought it was last year!
Damn this one looks better than the one they just did the other Halloween movie the recent one that's out this Halloween movie looks more scary more intense more gnarly the kills are more gruesome impalements using other weapons yeah this one looks sick
This movi finna be a so good I’m already finna rate 10/10
At 1:33 are the evil masks from Halloween 3!
Yeah fine friday the 13th and now making a movie on that would be so sick
Wonder if this will actually be the true end, probably not. But it would be mad entertaining if it was
My favorite slasher of all time,but now they are dragging this one out too long. Get it together jamie lee Curtis...kill him this time
Laurie:Ah Shi#,here we go again
Just stop...
Honestly, I couldn't care less..
I've got to rewatch the trailer again
So Micheal Myers goes full fucking John Wick have my approval and Chucky needs to have a body form and kill in doll form and exchange back and forth
I hope he finally kills Jodie Foster and that entire fricken town that's done nothing but get in his way of going home  Except the firefighters that was a bit brutal to be honest
in october i will watch this movie while im doing the spooky dance
Daddy myers xb
Stupid people can't even kill one psycho with guns 🤣😂😂😂😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣🤣
Jamie lee kurtius will always be the 🐐
Mike Myers vs jason could like freddy vs jason
We’ll actually get to see his face maybe, this looks like it’ll be the best one yet
Wow but there are the masks from Halloween 3 season of the witch
This is how reboots are done
Classic Michael and his brutality I love it
The whole Town: DIE MICHAEL DIE MICHAEL  Michael: MY MASK GRRR GIMME THAT HITS HER WITH A BLOODY KNIFE  Her: OW SHOTS HEAD  Michael: umm? I dont die lol Hahah idiot
Subverted expectations, will be a black female with purple hair under the mask.
Michael lookin like Lebron James in his prime on this one 🤣🤣🤣
These headphones got my heart beating fast watching this
evil ressurected and want revenge jamie lee raised real hell earth bloodbath can wait see it xoxo
John Carpenter says Halloween Kills is like 'a slasher movie times one hundred' with a kill count unlike anything he's ever seen.
AYYYY IM EXCITED AF
That is going to be a banger, I can’t wait to see how many time is Michael going to die and come back. I guess they going to stretch it out another 40 years.
Oh shoot this looks like it is about to be the second best one🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💛💚💚💛💚💚💚💛💚💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
Good to see they've kept the long-standing tradition of people in movies walking up real close to someone to shoot them. As we all know, bullets have an effective range of 13 inches.
Finally the town looks like its gonna act! Even if you only take movie 1, 2018 and 2021 films you’d think a small town would be pretty fed up of him by now!
This trailer makes me proud of the fact my birthday is Halloween.
awsome
I do not want to be a firefighter in a Michael Meyers movie.
Not the whole town trying to kill him 😭🤦🏽‍♀️,  he’s like killing the whole town 😂💯
This feels like what "Revenge of Michael Myers" should have been.
I hope Michael gets a clean new mask by the end of the movie, really put some weight behind that transcends line
I'm just going around sharing the gospel to those who may not know it and may want it. People get salvation wrong, even those who say they are Christian. Salvation is a free gift. It is not something that we work towards or earn by trying to do enough good deeds.  So if you want to accept the gift of salvation right here right now, here’s how:  First, you have to realize that you’re a sinner. Every single one of us has done a bad thing. And it doesn’t matter if we’ve sinned once or a million times, just one sin makes us a sinner, making us imperfect. Even 99% is not perfect. Because even if we have lied once, that still makes us a liar. If someone murders just one person, that still makes them a murderer. “For ALL have sinned, and come short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23)   God says the punishment for sinners is an eternal burning fire, aka Hell. “But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and the murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death” (Revelation 21:8)  So then you may ask how do we not get thrown into Hell for eternity? How do we get to Heaven then if all of us are sinners? The answer is we need a savior to save us from the eternal fire and that savior is Jesus Christ. “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8)  Here’s the story of Jesus: Jesus is God who came down from Heaven to Earth. He became human, like us. He lived His entire life sinless. There were people that were jealous of Him, so they framed Him on phony charges and crucified Him. He died, was buried, and resurrected. And now He is up in Heaven.  And here’s the gospel by which we are saved: “Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:” (‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭15:1-4‬)  So the question is, why did Jesus go through all that? Jesus did that for us so that we can be up with Him in Heaven. Remember, sin is the reason why you can’t go to Heaven, so He shed His precious blood to wash away ALL of our sins (past, present, and future sins). He loved us so much that He died for us. “Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him” (Romans 5:9)  Nothing we do gets us to Heaven. We must believe Jesus’ sacrifice alone is what saves us. Your own good works (such as water baptism, attending church, or even any good thing you do) does not get you to Heaven. “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9)  To get saved you need to repent as a sinner. Meaning, you need to be sorry for being a sinner. So are you sorry for being a sinner? “For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.” (‭‭2 Corinthians‬ ‭7:10‬)  Do you believe everything you’ve heard so far? If you have, God wants us to come to Him admitting that we are a sinner who needs saving and that we truly believe in what He did for us.  “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” (‭‭Romans‬ ‭10:9‬)  You can say something like this, but remember these words are not what saves you. Saying words of a prayer cannot save you. It’s by believing and trusting in what Jesus did for you that saves you. You can say it in your own words if you want, but you can say something like this:  Dear God, I repent as a sinner. I believe Jesus is God, who died, buried, and resurrected, so that His blood can wash away my sins. I only trust in the blood alone to save me, not my good works. Save me from Hell. In Jesus’ Name I pray. Amen.  —————— This age of grace is coming to a close, so please get saved before the Rapture happens so that you don’t have to go through the Tribulation period. In Tribulation you then MUST 1) believe Jesus is your savior and 2) REFUSE to take the mark/name/number of the antichrist to be saved. (Do not take anything they want you to get or try to persuade you to get. Possibly including: a micro.chip (RFID chip), a vaccine patch, hydrogel tech, neuralink, etc)  “And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.” (‭‭Revelation‬ ‭13:16-17‬)  “And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.” (‭‭Revelation‬ ‭14:9-11‬)  (And if many people suddenly vanished, “aliens” did not take us. It was Jesus Christ taking us saved believers up in the rapture to Heaven. “Aliens” are fallen angels or some other form of evil being, such as nephilim)
This one Michael will just be picking them up and steb thier stomach
Come on if we're gonna have another Michael Myers movie can we at least have a new Jason movie or NOES movie
I feel like this is the end
2:20 Karen... De-masking... Knew something was up...
Fragrant Tuft of Hair  Judith's Tombstone Yep, this man at Evil Within III
Holy hell, this looks ... neat.
If Myers is so tough why dont he face an entire army or have him fought in a war
nigga got killed multiple times and is still grinding..
Y’all telling me this man still alive killing people at random and NOBODY has put him down yet?😑
Really like that Laurie feels more and more like the one trying to finish Dr.Loomis' work. She's now the one talking of him being evil incarnate , being Supernatural "He transcends" and like the legendary Loomis the only one who can truly prepare for him. Can't wait.

He looks pretty pissed off. About time he loses his shit.
Danny McBride and David Gordon Green came a long way from Your Highness.
All he ever does is kill people. Why did they even bother to make this remake?
This looks fucking awesome!
Let’s remake this pile of garbage. Why not. I have a million good ideas for movies plus plenty of others trying to get their movies made but let’s go for the low hanging fruit and keep remaking the SOS.   Why not!
I swear we need a fucking another jason voorhees movie to keep the ‘friday the 13th’ game relevant, activez
Is this real is their a new one coming out
Bros hacking life or sum
Poor guy just wants to go home and eat some Halloween candy yeesh! Wouldn’t it be funny if that’s all he wanted.
I understand that this sequel is connected to the very first movie, but In MY opinion Rob Zombie made a better remake in the entire franchise.🤷‍♂️
Strode "evil dies tonight" MM "hold my beer for four decades"
Michael is the only killer in movies that actually really scares me and I’m so glad they are still doing movies and the new ones are made in my generation!!
Everytime he dies, he comes back in another film.  This still looks fun though!  Jamie Lee Curtis is still in it so it’ll be great.
Mastermind serial killer classic movie days are back. 🍿
FUCK YESSSSSSSS 😍😵‍💫😍😵‍💫😍😵‍💫
20's kids : Conjuring series is more scary.  90s kids: Hold my Halloween series BluRay set.
thumbs up if you saw Kyle Richards from RHOBH!
I.am.so.hyped.that.the.franchise.is.still.not.over
They just keep getting better and better. Can’t wait!!!
I just want to see his face!
Hmm instead of myers doing the hunting he becomes the hunted🤔 interesting although plain concept
Am I the only one who screamed when I saw this trailer🔥🔥🔥🤙🏿🤙🏿🤙🏿
I feel like they will give the boyfriend a redemption arc and then get his ass killed so its effective.
Can’t wait to go see this with My Girlfriend 💙🔒💍!!
YES! I just knew there was going to be a new one. But was caught off guard though. I thought w/the teenage girl holding the knife at the closing scene meant that she was going to take over Michael's reign.
How come his sister gets old but he doesn’t? 😂😂😂
I felt like I just watched the movie
please stop making sequels for the love of God it ended on a high note last movie come up with something else PLEASE BRUH
Silver Shamrock. 😋😨
👍👍👍
That looked like 80% of the movie
“Evil dies tonight” …………”Trust Me Bro”
Michael should be about 80 by now lol
Undertaker Kane where you at 😎
anyone else feel like they spoiled some stuff in the trailer?
Mike Myers is not human, you can sympathize with him, you can not reason with him, you can only stare and run, you can not even fight, because he is not human and he can not die.
He's Back🤘🏾🕶️🤘🏾🔪
I still want a day where Michel Myers and Jason Vorhees are in the same movie
Michel I can't die  Strode evil dies tonight
“A Man could not have survived that fire” yeah nor can they overpower a 16 year old when said man is in his fucking late 50s
We need a Freddie VS Jason VS Myers
Apparently only Michael Myers knows about powerlifting in the Halloween Universe
I swear to god if there is another Holloween movie after this one
I feel like Michael myers will survive in this movie because I heard there will be another one after this movie called HALLOWEEN ends
He has been thorough all of this and he is stillll not dead are u serious 2045 Halloween chapter 3 part 4 headass
I used to love these, now this movie better be the last. I mean c'mon he got his head chopped off and still didn't die.
They won't let him die they won't let him live and they wonder why he keeps coming
Looks terrible
Hollywood is so lame!!! How many time can they make the same unbelievable shit! Its fawkin dogshit. That’s why diversity is much needed in Hollywood.
If Michael “dies tonight” wtf will Halloween ends be(aka Michael ain’t dying tonight😂)
Well who knew Michael Myers would be defeated by strong independent women, they've never tried that before
October? too long
THE REFERENCES TO PART 3!!!!!
Let’s just go ahead and say it, THE BLOCKBUSTER MOVIE OF THE YEAR!!!!
Enough with this series👎
Michel Myers always finds a way to live
And here I am thinking the last one was the LAST one like what😀
Micheal known about covid19 since the first movie ,thats why he's always wearing the mask 😷
Laurie really spent years booby trapping that whole house for nothing
I cannot fucking wait for this movie only 3 months 👏🏽😍
Definitely a lot more action and killing than climax building up to one kill scene from previous movies A+ so far
I'm not sure....But I don't think Evil is going to die on this night😂😂😂🤦
It’s kind of hard to care about this when I know theyre already making a sequel called “Halloween Ends”
Why isn’t anyone talking about that Halloween 3 Easter Egg??? That’s so cool!!!!
How many fucking times must they continue this? One was enough
the 2007 & 2009 were the best halloweens 💅🏻💅🏻💅🏻
But Michael Myers do not dead
Halloween kills. Yeah. And all the kills are in the trailer
They should have stopped after the original in 1978...Let it die already.....
The whole town boutta die
This year of Halloweenie movie better be longer  than 2018 one
How the fuck isn’t this guy dead it’s like every single movie he keeps coming back he’s like Godzilla they used every single weapon to kill this guy and don’t work this time in this movie they better kill him use a nuclear weapon and kill him it will disintegrate his body and he will be dead and then that’s it
Is anyone like me looking forward to the release date?
I can’t wait for this movie it’s Halloween and horror movies for me 24 -7 365 n if u don’t feel the same Go make luv to urself! Respectfully
This nigga never gonna die
Damn if I knew he was killing people in my town I would leave right away and book a flight out of state like England or somewhere over there 😂 it’s not like he can travel and go on planes
I was always scared of Michael, and now they made him blood thirsty 😱🏃🏾‍♂️💨
Man y’all showing too damn much! I just watched the whole film wtf
They got to put his body in acid to kill him.
“Evil does tonight”  Proceeds to miss more shots than a Stormtrooper
they showed like all of the killing in this trailer
The only way to control Michael is to lock him 1000 feet underground and freeze him into a cryo state 🤣
“Evil...dies...tonight” Michael: *Hold my buzz saw*
Smoking kills
Fuckin love the return of the hospital sequel
Micheal Myers vs the world
They'll be 1 more after this. Halloween ends. They've planned it
LETS GOOOOOOOOO
SUPER ANXIOUS.😎😎
Definitely seeing this in the theater 🤩
I like how the President  of American 🇺🇸 doesn’t know anything about Michael Myers running around killing people . The movie would be more believable if the Governor of that state at least called in the National Guard to hunt down the murderer.
Ok ok it’s done stop making garbage movies
Three words.. (silver shamrock masks) ☘️ 😱
大爛片.一死再死再三死..卻永遠都在復活的類"無敵鐵金剛兇手".老梗一直重覆.
Lets hope that this movie doesn't go along with how 90% of all movies are directed today Director= $1,000,000 Actors=$10,000,000 Writers=$10
One hell of a trailer and hopefully movie will also be as good.
This shit looks crazy
Why is Michael Meyers just not scary to me??
Halloween kills?? Really I thought he just sat you down and gave you a good old fashioned talking to...
Well, that was a fantastic 2 minute and 30 second movie. To the point, sharp and the storyline is great. I didnt even know the movie was coming out, they didnt even release any trailers, just the full movie on Youtube. Go figure.
The girls in this movie seem cringe.
I wondered why in the previous movie they didn't shoot Michael a dozen times, then douse him with gasoline or whatever before setting the house on fire. These horror movies and their get-out-of-jail clauses - hilarious but a classic part of the genre.
Why did they spoil the whole movie?
the guy from dead by daylight got a movei!!!!!
https://youtu.be/fdGXOVBDcHk
One of them trailers where u see 3/4 of the movie eh
OF COURSE HE'S STILL fucking alive... Who didn't see this coming he was breathing at the end of the last one. Place your bets here that there will be another hint, that he will live yet again.
The skeleton and the pumpkin head at the park kinda reminds me of skid and pump
This is giving me fast and furious vibes at this point🌚😂. I’m soooo sick of Halloween.
I like how he says "Captain grab my hand." Then screams when his hand gets grabbed.
Well I hope the trailer isn't showing all the death scenes 😳 🤦🙈
They should do Michael Myers vs Jason voorhes but eventually team up against the whole town
So happy they made another movie. Can’t wait to see this. Seems like much more killing though!!! 🔪🔪🔪
It’s been 43 years, when is Michael Myers gonna let up damn 🤬
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!!!!!! HOLLYWOKE!!!!
I remember them sh*ting on all the movies that came after the first one saying they turned Michael into this supernatural being with super human strength so they brought it back in 2018 to "correct" it but as you can see in this trailer they're contradicting themselves.
Oh my god! Can’t wait!
Fuxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ☠️🥺
YESS
Always enjoy the Halloween series.
Michael, stop.
How the fuck does this have 1.7k dislikes? Smfh this shit looks fucking epic probably just a bunch of pansies scared of these types of movies 💯.
Michael doesnt die because they have a sequal lined up
Ngl, the trailer makes the film seem iffy. I want it to be good, but im just getting a bad feeling.
It looks like this series has milked it so much the cow has turned into a goat…
What did they do to the theme song 🤮🤮🤮
God i hope this is the last one, it’s as bad as those damn fast & furious movies smh
Well that was gory.
“We finally killed him” Myers: “hold my beer for the next episode”
Hell yeah
Plot twist, Jamie Lee Curtis is actually Michael...
I Don't Agree With The Halloween Theme Music In The Back Ground..It Sounds Dumb 🤣
Why the fuck would they just show the entire movie in 2 min
Interesting 🤨
Wow! I really thought it was over. He is my age now lol. But I'm here for all  of it. Horror fan for life.
They won’t really stop him.
Trailers today show wayyyyy too much
Nunca muere este wey
I feel like you can only keep bringing him back so many times before it gets old and it's about making money, not making a good movie.
This is exactly how I planned it to go out, he kills all the firemen and escapes easily.
When Jamie lee Curtis screamed NO LET IT BURN, they should have listened to her 🤦🏼‍♂️
Hands down most anticipated film ever on my list! Every second of this trailer gives me chills
Michael Myers is so screwed the protagonist have the most powerful weapon      *Family*
I have seen every movie 🍿🍿 I think it's time to end it
Someone tell rob zombie this is how you make a “HALLOWEN” series
Honestly, I get the feeling Myers is gonna be the hunted this time
Maskless
halloween 3 masks are a nice touch.
How many times has she said “Michael dies tonight”, I feel like I’ve heard it a few times. Everyone just needs to leave that town and let him has his old house. Then it might all be over.  Now the entire town is going to die.
"Michael dies tonight" Michael :  bitch please
Am I the only one that realized those Halloween mask from season of the whitch
Yooo they kinda showed like all the kills🙃
3 Silver Shamrock masks  got 3 after all! Dan Challis was too late! Conal Cochran got his revenge!
Prepare for demon possession. Do people not see Hollywood's evil agenda??????? THIS IS PURE EVIL
The previous one was absolutely terrible. I am not looking forward whatsoever to that sequel.
Apparently having 3 fingers blown off with a shotgun,being stabbed in the back with a large kitchen knife,hit in the face with a crowbar,shot in the shoulder with a 44,hit with a car doing at least 50 MPH and shot in the neck with a rifle is just a warm up for Michael lmao Man can really roll with everything life throws at him 😂
This looks way more promising than that boring overrated 2018 movie.
You misspelled Machete Kills!
Somebody need to just take his big ass trick or treating
why are they giving away the kills?
People: Myers dies tonight.  Myers: lol
I thought she chop off his head in H20!!😂😂
MY BODY IS READY
Can’t wait to see this
I haven’t noticed anyone talking about seeing his face..???
He’s never gonna die😂😭
could he survive a tank?
I can see it now…it’s 2035. And someone shouts, will somebody swing by the retirement home and pick up Michael? Tell him this one will be different than the last one.
This looks like it's going to be a very good movie
Michael Myers look like he's mad now because he's killing anyone he sees
I didn’t think it would be another any time soon but got damn let’s bring it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I wish Dr. Loomis was still around doe 💯💯💯
I thought it was over and I'm glad it's not especially glad it didn go out on the rob zombie one's but🤷🏾
Evil dies when the box office flops
This should be exciting
Garbage.
Can’t wait to see this movie it actually looks like it’s going to be a great Halloween movie in my respectful opinion.
The way Michael walks out that burning house and murks those firemen🔥🔥🔥
Call Busta Rhymes
In Halloween ends how do you think he will die
bye- i’m so excited i’m crying already marked it on my calendar and everything
-they're chanting  "EVIL DIES TONIGHT!!" -the dead people on the Merry go round were the couple leaving for the party as michael walked down the street in the last film - The three masked victims are wearing masks from Halloween 3 the only non Michael Myers Halloween film HOLY FUCK THIS IS GOING TO BE BALLS TO THE WALLS BRUTAL AND AMAZING!
Bruh. Why would Micheal be killing random people. If it's based of the original Micheal then his mission is too kill Laura only, and not random folk
I've watched this trailer more than any trailer ever. October can't come quick enough!
Well that was nice of them to show 90% of the movie for free. I think I’ll save my 12$ for the 10%.
They should try to give Michael covid-19.
Okay to us fans to us fans to us fans when is this coming out in August you know we got to get this one we got to see this one I'm still waiting to see the quiet place too at home they haven't released it yet like to watch it at home nobody want to go to no theaters the theaters is not clean but what's up a new new Halloween oh you know us fans we want to see that.
This makes me happy 🙂
These hands are rated E for Everyone
How is he still alive?
This is the most spoilerish trailer that ever spoilered! Dafuq!
1) Love the Halloween 3 reference 2) Did they just show every kill?!
Damn I cannot wait!
🥱🙄🙄
(liberals) 🙄👎🏼 has been running out of ideas 😴 after the 1st one 👍🏼
micheal is so pissed and mad bro💀😂
This gives me Halloween 4 vibes
@1:33 those are two masks worn by two children trick-r-treaters Michael passed by in the first movie...guess he killed those kids too?
Out ofnall the terrible movies out there, you name the mc “karen”?
1:33 reference to Halloween III
Why they showing the death counts? They know we going to see it they could've just had a basic trailer and we would go see it
@1:33 those are that kid Julian's parents on the merry-go-round...they were the ones in the first movie that were getting in the car in front of Michael when he was walking down through the neighborhood...probably Julian's hand right before that trying to open the car door... :(
"Halloween Kills - Official Trailer" ⚠️ SPOILER ALERT! ⚠️
Oh my gosh I don’t think I’ve ever been so excited for a new movie to come out!!!
I am way to excited for this then I thought was possible
HELL YEAAHH
Looks waaaay better than the last one they made.
“Stop! You have a knife in your stomach!” I felt like I was watching a comedy 😂😂😂😂 if it was Rob Zombie‘s, I probably would’ve checked it out
*why is this nigga so strong lol*
Laurie gives Michael some "Activia", then he shits himself to death!
Bro imagine after he’s unmasked he starts running for the first time😂😂
You guys likes murderer so much?
I much prefer Rob Zombie's version.
I talk crap about people watching all the fast and furious movies, but then when a Halloween movie comes out I’m like “ hell yeah it’s gonna be good lol “
Michael Myers will be a Terminator for about 90% of the movie and then suddenly get killed so easily. Watch. I'm calling it right now.
Will we finally get a face reveal? I hope so!😆
I really hope the next planned film is a good and actual conclusion and they let this character rest for awhile. Give people a chance to miss icons.
FUCK. YES.
This whole time he's just trying dap the lady up and keeps getting attacked
I can't wait to see another chapter in my little brother's life.
The more he kills the more evil he turn look at his nails like a monster
Bro who else wish they could see Jason Freddy and Michael Myers team up
How come Jamie never thought about just blowing him up with dynamite?
Yesssss
DEAR GOD LET IT END ALREADY!  This is really beyond ridiculous now.
HEELLLLL YEEAAAHHHH!!!!!   GREAT HORROR MOVIES NEVER DIE
Ha the Halloween 3 masks made an appearance
44 years after the first one which kept me from sleeping for 2 weeks after seeing it at 12 years old and he’s still effin with my head!!!!
Micheal is so dumb he could went to a government facility and launch all the nukes and still survive the explosion
Can we put this franchise to bed please?
"Let's hunt him down." Yeah sorry. Doesn't really work like that with Michael
Ben Tramer You're Our Only Hope! 🤣🤣🤣
I'm getting darth vader vibes from Michael
Bro a menace to society 💀🤣🤣🤣
Only real ogs saw the season of the witch masks
Shit look Tough 💪🏾
Wow!!!
How is bro still strong as hell 😂
If Mike Myers ain't the last man standing then fuck this movie.
I CANT STOP WATCHING THIS UGH 😫😫😫
“Evil does tonight!”  Micheal:...are you sure about that?
No lives matter movement 🎃
Well all know you need the Marines to kill Michael but unfortunately we have to suspend disbelief  and pretend that this is the only town in the whole country and world and nothing exists outside of  Haddonfield 🤣
If he kills enough people is he gonna Go super saiyan?? LMAO "more he kills, the more he transcends" *eye roll*
Micheal: “I don’t always die, but when I do, I don’t.”
Hopefully this one doesn't suck as hard as the last one.
If I was one of the fire fighters and I seen 3 get murdered like that I’m OUT
That group of  people are  expected to kill Michael myers
If he happened to be in D.C. January 6th I bet he would have been locked up by now🤣
Looks like they’re incorporating H2 , H3 & H4 iconic scenes 🎃 🧙‍♀️ 💀
This looks bussin
I'm want to see it so bad
Michael myers has 5 fingers doet you  remember from the last movie 3 fingers man🤨
MICHEAL IS MY DAD
This old woman is literally on her deathbed and just decides to get up and go hunt down a serial killer
He is pure evil walking on two legs
Eion michael Myers is alive and will not stop until everyone is out of his way
👏👏 Can't wait! Wonder why not chop him in pieces so he won't come back. Oh and burn his flesh. Just in case.
Feel like they showed all the kills lol
Freaking DOPE 💪🏻😷🤟🏻🐺💯
Hollywood 2020: we dont have any good movies for Halloween, because of covid Universal Pictures: ya we do
Although they have gotten carried away with these movies. This one actually look pretty good, and I may  watch it.
So Michael didn't get burned at all despite being trapped in a burning house??
I think her daughter is going to be crazy too.  At first I thought someone was crying, because they was sad about the person dying in the fire.
Ahhh yes can't wait
Are the podcasters in this one??  LOL what a terrrible idea
I Wonder how a holiday could kill
Welp. I smell a kill count coming up
I want Meyers to win. Am I the only one?  We need a video game were you play as Meyers and kill the “I’ve been trying to contact you about your extended warranty people”.
Im.sooooo excited
Myers vs fast 9 family?
Serial killer of canyon del muerto
ffs, he still lives!!?!?!?
“I’m coming for you Michael” did she not say that in Halloween Resurrection 🤔
I knew it
Damn, the Silver Shamrock masks.
Michael is making a return this shit finna be vicious asf 🙌
Damn it seems like death isn’t inevitable for Mikey
Not feeling good about this. Hopefuilly im wrong because I thought the last one was brilliant
Something tells me Michael will facecamp the people in the city with Evil Within III until each one dies.
This is fricken awesome, fricken gory and I love it. God I can't wait to see this in theaters this October, and that violin theme better be in the movie
Hope tthis 1 worth people money worth and not phony or boring 🤔🤔🤔🤔 ?
Everybody is looking too much into Lauries dialogue, she’s just saying he’s evil we ain’t getting no cult shit 😂
"Guys it's okay! He just wanted his mask back!"
They showed too many kills smh...
Year 2090: hallowen-the return of Michael
They giving away all the kills
This should be interesting.
I wonder if they will acknowledge that the husband died. Judy's character (can't remember name) seems almost happy until she gets the news Michael is alive
2:24 is the last shot of the film after Micheal kills Karen in the climax 🤪
jamie Lee is so talented. I LOVE that we got a revival in real time and weve seen so much more of her character. obsessed.
Clothing brand is called tropic. Would love to collab. Be a dream come true❤️🌊🌴
👈👌🍽🍽🍽🍽🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪☹
She always says evil dies tonight but still lives all the time
Let this franchise die, the first one fantastic and should have been its own movie. We did not need 11 sequels. But you just know people will see this in droves, and we’ll get even more of these. Well, at least John Carpenter is scoring
Why can’t they just get a whole gang of people with ak 47s And Baseball bats?
Ngl this happening exactly right where we left the last movie ended and instead of a few people trying to survive or try to kill him now it’s an entire town and more and the mask in the thumbnail is sick and people said last movie sucked but they may now appreciate it more due to this since LOOK AT HOW THEY ARE DOING IT ITS AMAZING purge but against one immortal like being
Micheal Myers gonna Turk up the Town
July, 2022: Dead Meat: “All right, let’s get to the kills, the movie begins with the house on fire, and a team to come wash the fire away oh no! Laurie screams to let it burn, so they do. The movie ends with the house burning to the ground. How many kills did this part 2 to the trilogy of new Halloween movies get? Let’s get to the numbers and find out”
Does anyone else think that the Halloween masks were a nod to season of the witch?
Wtf, how many more Halloween movies do we need?
My God, Hollywood is just pathetic now...
Note to Haddonfield Fire Department, when a house is a blazing inferno if there was somebody mortal inside they should be toast unless you're evil on two legs hiding in a gun closet.
Ok so it goes Halloween 1978, Halloween 2018, Halloween Kills and finally Halloween Ends, Imagine if in the final one his mask gets destroyed but he kills Laurie Strode and makes a new mask out of her face
OH SHIT 🔥🔥
Yeah they showed a lot of bodies and kills in the trailer, but remember that the body count is said to be about double or more of the last movie, which had 17, this is going to be a bloodbath! Also love the inclusion of the inclusion of the Silver Shamrock masks.
Oh jeeze  How original…. We are going back to Michaels home……. Who could have ever seen that coming
I remember the cement saw being used in a kill only in High Tension and now its being brought back around and I love it
No hot women?
Oh shit
Did I just watch the entire movie in under 3 minutes.
Michael vs Jason. Probably wouldn't be much of a plot, if it existed.
Rainer's Vadder lebt
Sure evil dies tonight. Hey! Maybe while we're at it, we'll find out what happened to the planes and ships that went into the Bermuda triangle!
1:32 Silver Shamrock's masks?
The more he kills, the more he transcends..................       Then he must be transcending every movie then.
Don’t get on my boy Mikey mannn
How to deal with Micheal. Make him unconscious, trap him in a plane, put him on a island with nothing and bam everyone lives
Ok, now this series is just getting stupid
Dude how much are they going to milk this is going to die in this one and come back the next one
Boring, how many films is this now? Make something new!
I live for this!!!!! What a great time to be alive!!!!
Not even John wick will be able to beat this man hes immortal.
Oh now he’s pissed.
I can't wait to see full movie!! 🔥🔥
Oh, just you wait. He's only gotten to tier 2... for now...
Lemme guess his coveralls were fire retardant all along..
That awesome when he walks out on the porch! He has a look like "Its Go Time"
Yessir!!!
Finally!
Great an other halloween movie but HOW MICHAEL MAYERS CAN SURVIVE THAT
feel like I’ve seen every death in the movie already
that moment when movies step in up a notch...
This movie is gonna suck
Hollywood’s current generation is so dreadful, why do they just keep remaking and building off old stories. Come up with new stories without clinging to established movies of the past. Make a new name ffs
Well it can't be any worse than Halloween 6 the Curse of Michael Myers
How much of the movie are they going to give away?
V
I’ll take Myers into his house and infinite loop him for days! 😂 Any dbd fans here? 💀
This seems like it a going be a Action Horror movie that’s about people fighting for their rights to live. *insert the riots of 2020 ✊🏾
This movie should be rated PGD...people gonna die
So dumb, come on people.
EVIL DIES TONIGHT! EVIL DIES TONIGHT!!
Jamie lee curtis 🤢🤮👎
Ok so clearly the leaked script was real, but I bet the ending has been totally changed just like the last one, there are already lots of scenes in this trailer that are slightly altered from the script so it's possible. Overall this is going to be insane.
He set himself up with that saw🔪👻
The silver shamrock masks were there. We might get a remake of those too
Even his moveset has changed, this feels like a new intensity of rage for Michael.  And the whole concept of him "transcending" is definitely taking the whole "pure evil" thing to a new level, love it!
Mike always finds a new way to kill people.  I love it
I hope so I love micheal myers he is the best
I wished that they made a Halloween Movie just on The Man In Black!
In Halloween 5, they had filmed where he had taken out a whole entire SWAT Team, but here it shows where he takes out a whole entire Fire Department!  The Firefighter that we see at 0:33 and then another close up shot of him at 0:40.  My best guess is that he survives Michael's Massacre of the whole entire Fire Department.  And then he ends up becoming a Main Character in this Movie.
I swear ong no crosses that There was gonna be a new Halloween movie in 2021
Definitely showed way too much of the movie.... like damn can I be surprised about something?????
Who plays Michael Myers this guy's is immortal
Maybe they’ll finally kill him this time.
Im so hyped
YASSSSS
This looks incredible lets gooo
They need to make another Freddy vs Jason
This Will be the best movie of Michael Myers
Stupid stupid firefighters 😂
I hope this movie is a HUGE hit his like the last one. So they will have to make another sequel.
Just remember everyone there’s 1 more Halloween movie after this one will see this devil die soon😈
This the only movie from the 70s that people are still checking for.
omg Kylie Richards is in this movie
uhhh this again...   "Evil dies tonight"  10+ movies later...  For the next one, please, bring toretto, and terminator to race on wheelchairs throwing them pumpking from their diapers!!
Entire town: We have all gathered here to finish Michael Myers. Michael Myers: So anyway I started slashing
“you Talk as if he were a Human being that part of Him Died Years Ago”- Dr. Loomis
The original form the 70s and the other parts from the 80s were classics. There’s no need for all of these. They are shit. I’m only 21 born in 2000 but trust me nothing beats the classics
The firefighter scene was dope
I’ve been waiting since 2018 for this. And there’s another one coming out 2022
The actors accept for jamie lee Curtis are all cliché and it makes me cringe to watch, but ill still cause im a halloween fan.
I feel like this gave away way too much
Oh man what a shit show, they have ruined the franchise
LETS GOO MICHAEL MYERS
Can’t wait !!!! Will be the first one in there!
Is the new strings version of the film a homage to the Halloween II 1981 synth version?
He's back  Death incarnate The man in the shadows  The shape that follows   The boogie man   He's back  Michael Myers
Haha I love the Halloween III homage with the skull, pumpking, and witch masks.
Looks like they should've named this movie...Halloween OVERkills. LOL
It kind of bugs me that Michael was still somewhere in that room even though it was totally empty. Where the fuck did he hide?
This feels like a working title
Well... this trailer was as exciting as the Q-Force one.
Michael feels more like Jason in this trailer
SO HES GUNNA BE UNMASKED??? SOMEONE HELP WHEN DOES THIS CONE OUTT HELP HELP HELP
Man I'm soo ready for this movie
AGAIN🤦🏻‍♀️
Kann es kaum erwarten 😍🔪
I like how its kinda like the original. Where Laurie fights him in the house, leaves him to die, he survives, and the next movie is right after at the hospital instead of a year or more later. I think its a cool touch since they kind of reinvented it😊
This looks great. 🔪
The dumbest thing in this movie is that a 60 year old man can overpower 20-30 year old men
Yall should've just let it burn-
*"Candyman" and "Halloween" trailers in the same week, as a horror classics fan i'm so excited*
This looks fantastic, can't wait
"Evil dies tonight"
Just let this man kill Jamie so he can chill already. All these innocent ppl dying while he trying to kill her. If he kill Jamie he might just turn his life around. Maybe enjoy thanksgiving and Christmas take that dirty mask off, grow old, create a IG page fall in love, break up and repeat like normal ppl.
When is this releasing
Kill count being 50+ I heard is crazy
Halloween Cello Theme 💟💟💟💟💟
I love the EASTEREGGS 💟💟💟💟
“Let it burn...” I agree, let the Halloween saga burn. It’s enough.
Mike is forever immortal
The movie is definitely on my radar
He just can’t die! 😈🥀🔥 #MICHAELSREVENGE
So what made you want to make another Halloween movie? Universal: money
Plot: Michael Myers escaped and killed a few fire fighters and goes on a massive killing spree. Tommy Doyle and Lindsey Wallace returns to help Laurie and gather a few of towns folks to hunt down Michael.
Ah shit !! here we go again 👍🏻
This series is dead...leave it be
YES B****!!!!!!!!! So excited!!!!!
?
Dead meat where u at
Michael: listen we can do this the easy way or th— “gets stabbed”   Michael: you have chosen the hard way
Wow he walked out without a scratch & killed the whole Fire department
Tell me if I'm wrong, but there's going to be 1 more movie after this one, right? Soooooo... he ain't dying in this one 😂
Very hard relationship each other ..
I'm not gonna lie, this looks absolutely incredible.
I feel sorry for Michael, first kids on cod turn him into a game then they drag him out to make another movie , I’m sure he would rather chill with Freddy and Jason
Let me guess, they double kill each other with knives and he comes alive agian in five years...........
Looks GOOD BUT ...... I hate that trailers give Everything away.
Gotta love those Silver Shamrock masks!
Been waiting 2 c the official trailer of the movie cant wait 2 c it
Y’all better stop playin with that mans
Michael Myers is like the highlander. To finally kill him you will probably need to take his head off.
Yessir
Michael Myers hasn’t looked this scary since the first two original Halloween movies 🎃🔪🔪
I LEGIT SCREAMED THIS SHIT GONNA BE SO GOOD😩
Finally. It returns in flesh and blood.
Myers said “Fuck it, I’m Rated E ...for Everybody now”
*Hello i am James A. Jennise and welcome back to Kill count*
Can we please get Michael Myers as MK11 DLC Character 🙏
Holy fuck😂😂😂!!!!!!!
Laurie isn't the Burt Gummer this series needs.  Seriously Burt woulda had this sorted out in one movie.
Mike has died about 300 times just won’t stay dead you could Nuke him he would still be back 🤣🤣 but anyways love the Halloween  movies 👌🏻
I feel terrible for all those innocent firefighters. He slaughtered all of them.
Can't believe them firefighters actually thought they had a chance against Mikey
lol, I'm surprised the SWAT team hasn't shown up and just utterly blown him to bits and pieces yet, like the opening to Jason Goes To Hell.  Speaking of which if you shut the movie off right after that scene, it's an A+. lol.
Michael Myers and Freddy are hands down the best villains.👍🏽
When a Killer drops a knife or an axe use it for your advantage to chop his head off plain and simple
Anthony Michael Hall, my boy from The Dead Zone is gonna be part of that! I won’t miss it.
How many times we gonna rehash the same story?
Told my wife the legend didn't die he already survived a fire.
Oh my god this looks AMAZINNNNNGGGGG I CANT WAIT
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I pray this film better NOT be a woke.
I've never been a fan of slasher horror, but this looks pretty good.
Basically just saw the whole movie.
How to survive a horror movie: Always be the camera man
he's back!!
“My grandmother was right the boogie man is real”
A new weapon i see. Fine choice sir Michael.
The incandescent palm complimentarily yawn because belgian conspicuously discover but a purring rest. able, giddy battle
Myers over Jason anyday!
Finally a horror movie that has firefighters actually trying to fight the killer after he came out of a burning building that was the best scene evey I am definitely going to watch this movie
Is micheal immortal or juiced up or he jus strong
I have a feeling Micheal is gonna talk
Ohhh I spy Kyle Richards 😊
I'm so excited
This looks great. Especially the shots of him casually walking out of the flaming house
This movie about to be 🔥🔥🔥
I love the Easter eggs from the other Halloween movies🙌🏼
Micheal has been quarantined in that flaming basement for so long. Can’t blame him for being just a little angry😂😂  #HalloweenKills2021
It releases 3 days after i celebrate 15 and im a massive horror fan I love october.
"He can't hurt anyone again" 2040: Halowen: The Return
Showed a bit too much of the kills there, damn leave some as a surprise for the movie
Honestly so psyched for this AND Scream 5
Hype!!!!! Thought last one was it
I feel like I've already seen the movie. Good Job Universal on consistently putting a movies best scenes in the trailer.
They milking this series aren't they? Lmfao
A new Candy Man movie 🎥 and now this! Yasss!
Michael gonna take on the whole city
RIP MARION :(
"Evil... dies... tonight!'  Michael Myers: BITCH!... PLEASE!
He's not dead again, this is not news
Get the military on him 💀
Whole hood goin for him or what? Lol
This is a metaphor for the Biden administration.
So we pretty much just saw the whole movie ……
Not another one ffs
Myers not feeling cute this time I guess..
this looks plain and stupid who pays money to watch garbage like this
Michael escaped from the basement after that firefighter fell through the floor from the kitchen. BOOM!!!!
I don’t even know why I watched this. They are dragging it out at this point.
He look pissed . Anyone getting in his way is dead
These movies scare me more than pure ghostly movies
3 things in life are certain. Death, taxes, and Jamie Lee Curtis with a knife in her hand.
HELL YEA
Always it is over.but it never happened
Not ANOTHER one!
I better see that ugly ass face Michael got. The only reason I keep coming back actually.
I love how they brought back the silver shamrock masks from season of the witch, that’s a good Easter egg 😃
This will bring me into the movie Theatre
Well that's one way to bring a community together go on a witch hunt for a mask wearing murderer
I’m sorry but they keep dragging this shit too long already. At some point, this dude has to die, it just unrealistic at this point.
It would be so easy to kill him...
Bruh all this just so a new movie can come out in a year
Yessssss!!!
I was hoping for a Metalcore breakdown after "LET IT BURN!"
Why are u showing the best parts smh I’m basically watching the movie for free
Bbbrrrrrooooo Michael Meyers yyyeeessss 🤘🏽🖤🖤🤘🏽
They'll be making these movies when I'm 87
I’m kinda confused as to why it took the town so long to band together to “try” and get rid of Michael. He’s the real MVP of Haddonfield IL.
This comment probably won’t be found, but when is someone gonna have the common sense to just chop Michael’s head off when he’s incapacitated? Laurie did it in one of the movies but it was with the wrong dude.
Ayyy.
Cant believe I’m gonna go watch yet another one of these ☠️☠️☠️
Michael Myers out here having a solid multi decade career. Millenials could never....
So I think I just streamed the entire movie.
1. Halloween(2019) 2. Halloween 3. Halloween 2 4. Halloween 4 5. Halloween H20 6. Halloween 5  The rest u can burn in the dumpster
2028 Halloween: apocalypse The world has been destroyed by a global pandemic and Michael Meyers hunts its last survivors  Let’s make some predictions
Loved the Season of the Witch references! I hope they incorporate elements from that movie into this one!
These films are pointless now
Cant wait to read Dead Meat title  "Halloween Kills Kill Count"
So are they leaning back to him being supernatural, because they’ve been kind of tip-toeing around that in this continuity when compared to the others.
Oh and by the way, yes John Carpenter came back to show Rob Zombie how it’s done and he went above and beyond again.
So they basically showed all the gruesome scenes.  Kudos!
This looks like Curtis’ best performance yet.
Yessssssss
Just kill them all
So are they going to drag out sequels until the franchise is shit? Hollywood did it to Jason, Freddy, Leatherface, etc Just stop. Horror movies now focus more on jump scares than anything. I love horror movies, the best ones were in the 70s-80s, now I can barely watch any. Just end Myers and let him finally rest
anyone know any websites to watch? wink wink
When this stupidity in the name of a movie will end ?? Is he taking down the whole city ?? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Well them hunting him is a new take, a brave one, bcuz at some point it's gon turn into an action movie if they're not careful
He's 61, but hell, The Shape never gets old, really looking forward for this sequel.
Bro how old is he??? Why is he not retired 😂😂😂
That doesn't look bad, I might actually go to the theatre for that one.
i can’t be the only one who be wanting michael to win😭🤣
This is gonna be good
A MELHOR FRANQUIA JÁ EXISTENTE
This better be a last trilogy.
YESS
anyone else feel like "the more he kills, the more he transcends" line is a bit corny? Could just be me idk
Niggas be walking up hella close with a gun 😐. Like bruh obviously he's gonna grab it.
Evan...get in the car
Damm he killed that black lady like it was nothing
This looks like complete shit
Massss 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can't help but wonder what his face must look like after being under that mask all these years! Lol
The psychotic fork clinically call because kimberly immunohistologically worry beside a pumped handle. fat faulty, gainful violet
Infinite tier3 against the whole town😂🤣🤣i cant wait this one seems even better than the last reboot
Where can we buy the poster?
Best killer ever
Is this the last Halloween movie or is there one more after this one?
He doesn’t eat any meals or take bathroom breaks.
0:37-0:46, After seeing that, I wonder what happened when Michael Myers fights the Purge.
Michael Myers vs Fire Fighters… I neeeed it 👀
Daaaaamn this is gonna be littt!
Can't wait!!
I love this but it’s showing most of the kills lol
We all know he wont die             But I'm still going to watch it and hope the movies dont stop
Can’t wait I’ll be seeing this
STOP MILIKING THIS SHIT!!
Michael Myars....yeah sure
Holy fuck.. I’m just in awe how much  Michael Myers mask look like joe Biden’s face In the thumbnail lol. The black sunken eyes, a look of utter blankness and wrinkles. They should just make Michael Myers talk in this one, and have him Ramble and stutter incoherent racist nonsense before he kills ppl😂.
Most people don’t realize that the bald guy in the trailer that says what are we Gonna do is Tommy
He’s for sure killing the boyfriend from the last one 😂
Oh shit who’s excited
ARE THOSE THE MASKS FROM HALLOWEEN 3
Hollywood presents..... another remade movie because we don’t have an imagination to think about new shit
Wow! On 1:33 — reference to “Halloween: Season of Witches”
Is this were real life the president would send an army and end myers quick
That is gonna be a badass movie
This dude has gone from michal myers to leatherface!]
Besides John wick  Michael Myers is the only person who can kill someone with a  pencil a f*ck pencil
Jamie lee Curtis is back baby
I want a hour and 30 mins of him killing getting tired and just going fuck dude
Dead by Daylight : Myers cosmetic loading ...
I CANNOT fucking waitttttt!!!!!!!!! 💯
Heyyyy, this movie was filmed in my hometown.
Is He still a male at least?
But she cut his head off in H2O, oh well I love Jamie lee Curtis in anything Halloween, although the original Halloween is my favorite!. I need to see this.
Saqahayang : Sikopet mah...kuat...
to much Spoilers :(
The next Halloween movie after his one, Michael myers will be in space ⭐️
Micheal myers is a classic i would love to see it that one  last  movie i thought they ended him
did uu hear julian in the car :o
It always amazes me when a group see a big devilish murderer come out of a blazing house and their first instinct isn’t to run away lol
I can’t wait to see this movie
This trailer is mad scary, i had to look away a few times
Damn how strong is a 60-70 years old man?
LETS FUCKING GO!!!!
Yee
I thought that was cool when a firefighter was trying to fight Michael with a electric saw.
Micheal about to be going to war with everybody in the town
so they tossed the whole relation thing out right? I don’t care, he’s still Laurie’s brother in my book.
2 years from now... halloween is alive
Universal and BlumHouse, ABSOLUTE the most BAD ASS living thing EVER is THIS one Michael Myers in THIS movie. Complete savage, animal, and I hope to see him slaughter the whole town but the cops will prolly stop the mob and arrest him in end to set up H.Kills.
it seems that michael myers is immortal 🤔
The Icon Returns!!! With a Half Melted William Shatner Mask & "8 Fingers" This Intro is F'n Sick!!!!!!!!!
This could all be resolved if the police would just surround him then fill him up with lead, should not be this difficult
Whoa! Love the Halloween 3 references. I know a lot of people diss that movie but I still think it's entertaining.
William Shatner is at it again.
Dam they just keep making these movies. Director is like “yup wife spent all of last movies money, let’s make another one “
Wow! Watching it I feel my eggs shrinking😱🏒🔪
way to spoil every kill 😭
Thanks you for show me all of the movie. See you next time
Town of Haddonfield: if we all bunch together, he CANT beat us and he can't kill us ALL!  The Shape: Hold my beer...
Yeah!!!! Finally a slasher movie. Been so long a slasher movie trailer intrigued me!
The name of the movie is stupid, im a hollow ween fan, but im tire of them making n releasing hollow ween movies n not sticking to the story n some missing characters
Still. I'll watch Halloween films, but none of them are half as good as John Carpenter's Halloween, and super controversial what I'm about to say: Halloween 3 Season Of The Witch. Why? Because it was original and attempting to start a Marathon series, which I think would've potentially be leaps and bounds better than 12 sequels with 2 retcon reboots. I'll still see it though.
Rootin for Mikey…no prisoners no excuses
Unnecessary forced sequel. Last one was just okay. Big skip
Ya no mamen
WE LOVE JESUS CHRIST REPENT AND CONFESS NOW BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST NOW AMEN FIX YOU'RE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ALMIGHTY FATHER NOW AMEN
looks to be in fantastic shape showing lots of good footwork and agility. could be a potential top pick in the next nfl draft. hopefully nobody overlooks him!
I really think the reshoots screwed up Halloween 2018. The original ending, Laurie's daughter hits Michael in the heart with a crossbow arrow bolt, and he succeeds in killing Laurie. Test audiences didn't like it because they're dumb. Truth is, if Michael killed her, it would establish Michael is a force of nature after decades after John Carpenter's Halloween in 1978.  Plus, I don't really want to see 70 year old Jamie Lee Curtis keep coming back. It's like 80 year old Indy Jones fist fighting.
More girl power bullshit
Michael is going nutts dude needs to stop chasing just one girl after 30 years sheess let it go already there a lot more out there
this looks fucking sickkkkk
Good thing he didn’t have asthma… because he would’ve died for sure with all that smoke and that mask on …lol
Love it
This trailer is more addicting than The Batman trailer lol like if you agree 👍🏽
Her: it ends tonight Mike Meyers: trust me it doesn’t
Finally after years, Haddonfield has had enough of Michael's terror !
I feel like they show too much in trailers
1:33 3 more months till Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, 3 more months till Halloween, Silllverrrr Shamrock
Yes!!!
"He can't hurt anyone again"  Michael : dope, more movies
Just call the national mf gaurd
Michael Myers never dies,he's the evil 😈
This is bout to be crazy 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯 cant wait to October is here
that cgi when he is walking out of the house ....... not  good lol
It looks good, but is his weakness gonna be the same as Jason’s? Just take off his mask?
Wonder if Kyle Richards character will survive?
"Listen, and understand. That Michael Myers is out there. He cant be bargained with, he cant be reasoned with, he doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear, and he absolutely will not stop... EVER, until you are dead!"  Wait who is this?
Cool cool, give me Friday the 13th and elm street please.
OMG this trailer has ONE thing different than the leaked trailer when it shows Oscar it WAS Cameron running into a fence
Now i know exactly who dies😔😔
I used to own that Mask & a scream suit wiv voice box...
I feel like I saw so much of the film I dont need to pay to watch it now.  Not sure that is what the distributor wanted.
But he only has three fingers on one of his hands…
Finally something with an original touch and Classic at the same time.
Everyone gangsta until..... Micheal turns in to a mutant demon thing and "kills" everyone and thee end
Omg I wanna see this so bad
I love the fact that this movie has stretched my whole childhood and adult life so far...I hope Micheal never dies honestly...I love seeing him in action .
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
Neat little H3 nod 🎃💀🧙🏻‍♀️
how to get a new York City
Halloween 3 - Michael Myers Survives Covid 19
Finally a new Halloween 🎃
O único filme de terror atualmente que vale a pena! MORRE LOGO DESGRAÇA!!!
Awesome trailer,  just done with the laurie strode character at this point
Just looking at the trailer I think it’s the fastest I’ve ever seen him move.
Yea this looks serious
Looks good
Jesus loves you all so much! He died on the cross for the price of our sins and 3 days later, he rose from the dead. He died for our sins so that we may have eternal life in Heaven with him and not perish in Hell. If you believe that with all your heart and confess that you are a sinner and in need of a savior, you will be saved! Come to Jesus and believe on him today! He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life! The Only Way to God!
This man just doesn’t want to die 😂😂😂😂
Laurie:No no no let it burn Me: Yes yes yes poor Myers needs help to kill the full town😂
Who else rooting for Michael?
Jamie Lee Curtis, John Carpenter...  This is gonna be GOOOOODDDDDD
go back to the orginal instruments whats up with the goofy violin in the theme music reef. i hope its not like that in the movie but it looks great!!!!
“What do we do?” “We fight.” That’s the second time I heard that. 5 years ago first being Civil War. :)
Those were some good kills they already spoiled in the trailer 😒
When I think I've seen too much of the same good old Michael Myers and that he should be finished once and for all, then I remember Hollywood this days and remember Michelle Myers is always a possibility ... Keep killing Michael!!!
They need Heather Swanson.
End Micheal this shit is old👎
Well I guess they released it early.
This looks better than last one.
A Battle Royals hosted by Micheal Myers, no respawns are aloud. Rules: get 1 kill on the red side and you win.
Did I miss a Halloween? What happened to that son she had?
just have them watch matpat’s video, problem solved.
I just know this movie is gunna be good like all of them 😈 am a be Michael 😩😩😩😩😩
Getting exhausting
“A man couldn’t have survived that fire, the more he kills, the more he transcends, he’s the essence of evil.” Haha, very clever,  this is a very good excuse for more sequels. LOL.
Dead Meat is going to have a heyday with this one when it comes out on blu-ray.
Z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z...Hollywood stopped being relevant 35 years ago. I wanna see a 70 yr old JLC about as much as an 80 yr old Indiana Jones.
Halloween my favourite horror films ❤️
Hell yeah!!! Something to look forward to finally!!!!!!!
Halloween - Beating A Dead Horse
Micheal walks out of the burning house was 💯 legendary 🔥🔥🔥😦😦 gets me chills today
It is exaggerating now
even at 70 this man is still deadly.
This is bullshit.. the producers really showed all the death scenes from the movie in the fucking previews?? I just got a two minute short version of the movie..
Omg!
Can this series just die.
Michel Myers Vs The World
Rob Zombie's Halloween was the best! 👍
Bad bad trailer. They're trying So hard to be cool.
As long as jaime Lee Curtis is in it I will continue to watch halloween!
Wow!  the trailer showed way too much
Well, he may kill people but at least he always wears a mask, even Michael Myers listens to the CDC.
Micheal Myers will never die and especially how the world is going hed just come back as Michelle Myers in the next movie lmao.
Enough with Jamie Lee Curtis. She’s awful
"take my hand!!!" Michael Myers: thanks bro
One of favorite Killers
The trailer gives away too much.
How has anyone overlooked that Blumhouse is the one doing this??? I can’t wait to see it especially knowing they love to show blood and gore.
That’ part when micheal is coming out of the burning house looks sick 👌chills
This kill count gonna be crazy lol
Nobody gonna talk about the masks from Halloween 3?
Michael only needs a hug 🤗
hopefully it's better than the last, or this is the last
Am I the only one that feels like they saw the whole movie just now? Is MM? Speed walking now? Sheeeeeeeassssssshhhhhh
Dead by daylight community, rise!
.....
Kills all these people, survives gunshots and fires, but cant get a 60 year old woman
Looks awesome, it gave chills just watching the trailer. I definitely got to see this one. 😊👍
Am I the only one who thinks this trailer reveals way to much
That’s firee🔥 L look forward
Myers takes some good ass cocaine or sum, he becomes indestructible
EVIL DIES TONIGHT
Is this supposed to be a trailer cuz...I feel like I just watched the whole movie
Shit looks maaaadddd corny smh
Caraca Arrebentou
Can y’all make another horror movie saga and just give this a rest already ?? 💀💀💀
It seems like I already watched the movie
I wonder if this will go into November 1st. I mean they can’t make 3 sequels stretch all in one night right? 🤔
Don't care if it's bad or not. I'll still be watching this movie.
I love Michael Myers I want him to live on forever!!
this movie is from 1978 and it keeps going its like 43 years ago and i never know how Michael Myers get his immortality power and what caused em to kill his own family
Sheeeeesh
Ok he's alive again, when will he die? 🔪
How come my boy Michael Myers hasn’t have a crossover yet
YES! YES! YES!
He should never die tho
The little girl in the 1978 linzzy wallous finnaly dies
Is it me or does this video thumbnail look like someone is wearing Biden’s face as a face mask 😂
Fire
This Is the real trailer?
Covid Michael Myers, jus can't seem to get rid of this dude.
Yo this comes out on my birthday
I bet money they just showed every person that got killed well i seen the 🎥
Please say he at least mutters one single, word
I love michael myers
Ma boi
I just creamed my pants
This guy should have an apex banner and it should say 1,000 and sum kills
🌹👍
They just wont let it die will they? Ffs.
Now this one look GGGGGOOODDD
Tbh after Halloween ends there probably gonna make another 10 movies
This looks great but they're showing waaay too much.
MOG I cry for it
Felt a little sad when i thought Michael might die in the fire but after knowing he survived i kinda wish he was dead
when will they stop? Just stop already. STOP MAKING THESE STUPID MOVIES AND GO TO YOUR ROOM RIGHT NOW UNIVERSAL! YOU WAIT TILL YOUR FATHER GETS HOME.
extremely underrated sequel but the most thrilling sequel I've ever watched in my whole life.
It shows in the trailer exactly how he survived the fire. He hid in the arsenal cache hidden in the wall behind a metal door. Therefore his mask isn't fully burnt. Nor his clothes....
I cant wait😁😁😊
Nice easter egg starting from 1:30, all these 3 masks was used in Halloween 3 (the worst movie in the series)
Just a fyi, executive producer doesn't mean much. Just another way to get people to watch a crappy movie.
There’s no way I’m not gonna watch this movie
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
i wonder if c4 would take him out.
Weren't those masks from Halloween 3....... where snakes comes out if kid's heads when they watched the TV commercial...... the pumpkin and green masks
This trailer gives too much away feels like i just watched the whole movie
THEY BOUT TO KILL MY DAWG. NAHHH
This looks awesome i must say and how long have we had to wait? they might have to end up selling to Netflix or HBO
https://youtu.be/uArVzPKiD_4
Nobody's gonna send a SWAT team after this maniac?
Good god let the story die, it’s getting ridiculous
I can't wait
I can’t wait !!! I’m on Micheal side btw always have been
How many times has she said “Michael dies tonight”, I feel like I’ve heard it a few times. Everyone just needs to leave that town and let him has his old house. Then it might all be over.  Now the entire town is going to die.
Wow! Lifelong horror and Halloween fan. Michael is legit.
*I smell a Film Theory*
Bloom McBride and Carpenter  FUCK ME RUNNING!!!
I'm convinced only man that can stop Micheal is Rambo
Please stop giving what’s her face any work , she’s so outdated now .
Now waiting on Friday to come out😌
Well Michael is the star of Halloween but how many fucking times is Laurie Strode going to come back. I guess 900 lives run in the family.
Did I just spot Tommy Doyle?
Mike's body count is gonna be high in this one.
Who got chills when Michael new theme is played
Well James have fun.
ОН УЖЕ НЕ РЕБЁНОК
This isnt so scary 😑
Michael Myers=MM=33 jewmasonry
Is this a new movie from micheal that’s coming out
The one they made before this was actually amazing it didn’t feel diluted can’t wait to watch the next one
Damnnnn this dude ain’t this point is immortal 😠😠😠😠😒😒😒😒
We want BoogyMan vs JohnWick
I love how badass Michael Myers is going to be in this movie.
Michael at 0:36 : Showtime, bois
Michael fr looks pissed off and looks like he don’t care who or what you are, he will just kill you. I’m excited for this movie. Anyone else excited to see the Myers house again?
Not looking a subtle one ☝🏻
"Evil-dies-tonight"  Proceeds to miss every shot you take at him probably
Oooooooooo Shitttttt so ready he’s not a normal man butt his Halloween movies is my favorite of all times
It's not really a horror movie it's just some terminator action type of shit
Feels like I just watched the whole movie. Most revealing trailer ever. Wtf
Damn did we just watch the whole movie 🤔
Because running was not an option for the firefighters? Yeah, we’ll just stand here while he murder us one by one. 🙄😂 can’t wait to see this
Peace was never an option
He could do a song cover of: JOHN MEYER: your body is a WONDERLAND Credit to Slasherstreet boys 🔪
I feel like I just saw the best parts of the movie. Now I just need to see the last 10 minutes.
plis let's do Michael myers vs Jason voorhees
Man, movie after movie after movie, after not cannon after movie and this reboot, is a godamn overexploded saga
He can't hurt anyone again,they must not know how Michael Myers is
So they finally decided to pack this nigga out huh.. if Mike was in the hood.. well you know
Some scenes were filmed in my city lol. Cant wait to see if i notice anything , and also how many bodies michael gone catch 😈
All the Halloween movies you'd think the whole state would be dead by now!
😱😱😱😱😱😱
One question 🙋🏻‍♂️ how TF did he learn how to drive?
Michael must be pissed, normally he doesn't always kill people he comes across there are instances where he'll spare someone people and even young children and we never really understood his logic with who he chooses to spare but in this film everyone seems like fair game hide your kids hide your wives cause everyone dying.
Laurie's Long Halloween >>>> Batman's Long Halloween
Oh shitt, he's back
This looks awesome.
It is amazing.
You mean to tell me those fire fighters watched him kill their coworkers and they just stood their..🤦🏿‍♂️...but let's goooo!!!rob zombie will never be better than John carpenter
I would have hit him with every ounce of water there.
You greedy companies absoulutely destroy good films. This is just ridiculous now and fat and lazy
Yaw been tryin' to kill Mike for over 40 years. Your effort is futile.  Leave that man alone.
"Yo Dave, your house is on fire!" 0:14
These movies are always shit. Even the trailer looks shit. Can't wait to torrent this shitfest and stop it before it's even done  because it's not worth the time.
I like the idea of michael being the prey
He is STILL alive?! They really are milking the hell out of this franchise
Freddy & Jason: "That guy has not retire yet?"
At first I thought: "uh oh." Then I watched the trailer. Then I was like "Damn, I guess I'm seeing this."
Can we just say Micheal Myers wiped out tomato town...
Somebody in there?
Boring
Thanks for showing me the whole film
We want tamil dubbing🔥
Dr. Loomis if only you were here.  He was equivalent to Uncle Iroh while Zuko is Michael chasing Laurie…the avatar
"Michael Myers is flesh and blood." Yeah except he has the healing powers of Wolverine.
The Halloween franchise never makes sense. They make Michael out to be a regular human with a haunting past. But… the man survives things in the most unrealistic fashion. It’s still a fun franchise to watch though, I’m not even mad that they keep making more. I just wish they would establish a firm history that cements the fact that he really isn’t human at all. That way it’ll make sense when he survives the craziest of events. Thanks for listening to my random rant lol
(1:32) I see what they did there, cameo of the “Season of the Witch” (Halloween 3) masks.
The gore is a little much for me. I don’t know if I will be watching...
another one?
Michael will never die, he will always find a way
Can I find a friend who I love and who truly loves me?
Notice that these are the only movies Jamie Lee Curtis has been in in the past 10 years?   Not to mention you don't see a whole lot of movies being made these days with veteran actors and actresses anymore, and with Hollyweird continuously rebooting everything, or remaking movies that have less than zero to do with the original.  I like the Halloween franchise, don't get me wrong but at some point just....freaking......wrap the damn thing up already. I mean Michael's been stabbed, shot multiple times (even in the face in Rob Zombies remake) and burned,  if he ain't dead by now....it ain't happening.
This is gonna be epic
Three months to Halloween 🎃👍
LETS GOOOOO
💓🙌🏻🙌🏻yea
They showed all the damn scenes in the trailer
this is just gonna be all male kill count, 2021 films are becoming worse like that now,  all fire man getting killed summed it right up which gender will get killed only in this film.  you won't see any hot girls getting killed. how society is now, everything goes the woman way in horror films lot more extreme now, films should be many men and women getting ripped apart in films like this, not thousbands of guys then like 2 women.  when film industry has the me too movement proper feminist  you're gonna see less female deaths in this films, to be fait hallowen was pretty equal when he would kill genders
Must of watched this trailer 10 times or more. I am sooooo looking forward to seeing this movie with my best friend.
God I feel so bad Jamie Lee Curtis always getting targeted somehow, she's the original  final girl!
“Let it burn!!!!” God damn😭
Michael Myers is on a rampage and wreaking havoc...😱😱😱
No lie I can always go for a hood Myers film
Every single time I think about Michael Myers, I immediately think about Mike Myers, and then I think about Shrek.
Can someone call a sniper and just shoot him with a 50 cal rifle to end him already or just YEET him with a minigun and be done with it!?  But I guess Universal needs him alive...
It sounded good before this trailer literally ruined the whole film.
I like how the spoiled the whole movie with this trailer
I haven’t seen these movies but can someone please explain to me how can this Michael Myers guy who is supposedly human survive all of these things? Fires etc…
Freddy Kruger could never.
OLLY SHIAT!!!   This is gonna be the best one since the OG. Cant wait!!!
Feels like horror films are getting political.
"How is he still alive?" "Aah, so you want to know his secret? it's simple my friend only one word can answer that.. Money."
The Town: We have you all to one Michael: I like those odds
He needs to make up for last year's lock down no one out for trick or treating. He's got a lot to catch up with 🔪
It looked decent until the 80 year old grandma tries to be a badass
" you don't have to run, EVIL DIES TONIGHT" meanwhile the movie - Halloween : The first kill  Halloween and the winter soldier Halloween:  age of psychopaths Halloween:  civil war  Halloween:  the infinity war  Halloween: the end game -- and finally when Michael myers does die  Halloween: revenge of the fallen  Halloween: redemption
at this point hes just immortal
I like how they put the silver shamrock masks in there
Где русскоговорящие???
Yeah Michael myers is back
Plot twist :- laurie transcend into Micheal myer after trilogy.
Well... Michael better kill the whole town or im done with the Halloween franchise. No reason other than... Shits getting old. Sorry not sorry. We want Jason Vs Michael.... Freddy Vs CandyMan... Chuckie Vs Puppet Master...
*Looks like an action movie...*
When will this end 🤦🏻‍♂️
Would be great if the trailer doesn’t spoil you the whole movie.
又内涵我库柏
i still wish h2o was canon in the michael myers universe.
He is the essence of evil, so he is a politician.
People think this might be the last one but I don’t think so Michael Myers shall live he always does no matter what he gets out of situations people think that he’s Dead or they forgot about him Halloween shall live forever
Micheal Myers Battle royale. 1v100
Michael bout to hit unlimited tier 3 on dat ass. If you know, then you know 😂
“Im coming for you michael” while holding a weak ass knife. What corny ass ending to a trailer. 😂😂😂😂
OMG
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
Hope they put him on Dead By Daylight. 🤧
A trailer that shows all of the kill scenes. What's the point of going to see the movie?
Amazing!!!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
How Michael Myers has survived this long is beyond me
This is turning into a tradition
"Im gonna do what hasn't been done since 1978"...."Kill Michael". 😂
No!!! Nurse Chambers!!!!
I.....can't......wait!!! It's looking very good Universal Pictures, looks like you have been listening to fans and letting decent film makers shoot it. Some other film studios would have made this a 12a (PG13) Certificate, and made it more politically correct 😊. I'm so glad you have given the recent Halloween films the roller-coaster feel it deserves....From a true Halloween fan going back many years.....i thank you.👍 PS - I love the 'teal & orange' lighting 😊
Why do trailers show the whole fucking movie now?
Let’s fucking go
Fucking  EPIC!!!!!
*press PLAY & MICHAEL DIES TONIGHT, WE FIGHT but yet... through the whole trailer M.Myers Slaughtering Everybody; Michael Myers has not GAF since the first Halloween & 14 moves later M.Myers he still Death Throwing mfs; he is mix with all the Zodiac Signs running through his Veins & it's taking the whole damn city to Kill him; Michael has endless lives in him; he can not Die then BOOM he dies at the end & we go have another Movie of him COMING BACK* 🤦🏾‍♀️😭😭☠️😈🎭  #thisISaMustgoSEE
While i think halloween (2018) was an ok sequel. i think that this is gonna be a great movie so far from the trailer. cant wait!
Just do not bring back Freddy and Jason!
Omfg Michael’s will to live is stronger than James Charles lust for children
my guy survived a burning house, a car running over him, a straight fucking shotgun to his face, then gets stabbed in his stomach. decides to get up and kill hella ppl. wait im done. ITS BEEN 22 YEARS 😭😭😭
You’ve  just given away the entire fucking film 😂
this movie bout to be slap
⛲👚✈💛🦓🐼💮💗🎋🌟🌠🎦💙👙🎄✨🎄🌙       *God demonstrated His love to us by sending His Son Jesus Christ, who died and rose from the dead to Give us eternal life.* *He also promised to heal your body.* *If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead* *He'll give you eternal life* *(Look up at the sky and ask God)*
Love the idea of the town getting together to kill Myers, like in Halloween 4 and we all know how that turned out lol
*Halloween 4 (1988):* Michael Myers returns to Haddonfield, kills the entire police department, incites an angry mob, kills a bunch of people in the process, and lives to kill for another movie.  *Halloween Kills (2021):* Michael Myers returns to Haddonfield, kills the entire fire department, incites an angry mob, kills a bunch of people in the process, and lives to kill for another movie.  Talk about De Ja Vu.
I'm dying! Love the music! 🎃
showed us the whole movie
I heard the most recent Halloween was good but I’m not gonna even attempt to watch it since Halloween 2 was horrendous, this looks equally bad.
Looks like fireman soup
This time it's personal
Funny how no one can shoot MM in the head in so many movies. Especially considering this is set in the US. By random chance, MM should've been the victim of police brutality or random drive by hood shootings. This is not a horror movie, this is fantasy.
Looks like they're aiming for highest body count in this one
40 years after Halloween II, and Jamie Lee is back in a hospital bed with a wig on lol
YESSSSSS
A better option: Call in the FBI...
This was violent. Looked like a redband trailer.
When you see a fat blue haired feminist
Another one? Dope. Cant wait for Halloween in da Hood and Halloween: Myers back 2 da Hood
tier 3 myers
LET HIM BURN! haha i cant wait to watch this!!! trailer was epic finally the Michael we need!
That violin version of OST is fire!
Great to see a non corny looking horror film in 2021
The fire department allways gets the wrong end of the stick in horror movies
"Death has come to your little town, Sheriff."
I got your mask! I got your mask!
Also, can we get Michael myers VS Logan Paul? Now I'd pay to watch that.
Fluorescent tube light to grandmas gullet. Mike a savage.
Lets goooo
I just like how everyone is rooting for Michael Myers and it's great
This looks like the goriest one yet! I also love how people stand up to him in that one scene like he won’t twist there head like a watermelon 😂😂😂
Is this a remake of Halloween 2.... Some of the scenes in the trailer seem to match up. Enter SAM HAIN lol😂😂😂
Without John Carpenter, everything seems "empty" or over the top. Michael moves too much his body. In the old version, he barely moves is arms... which makes him more spooky. Now, everything is too...."hollywood" and less horror. Just my 2 cents.
The more he kills the more he leve up
Well all the deaths were shown. Thanks typical movie trailer for saving me money.
Cool
The undead Michael is back. We are waiting.
Anyone else think they need to leave these classics alone and come up with some new ideas
Every death is in the trailer
Looks INCREDIBLY lame and boring. They keep doing the same crap over and over again. Sad to see Curtis reprising her role. Put this character and Halloween to rest.
just when we thought he's finally dead...  Myers: I lived bish!
See y'all at the Dead Meat kill count
Halloween : Purge
Only thing I question about in the trailer is what hospital just let's ppl walk around with a bloody knife?🤣
I am scared to watch this as they give away too much in the trailers!
Dont worry Jamie the franchise burned a LONG time ago...sad times.
*And those who tasted the bite of his balde named him: Michael Myers.*
He does tonight. I feel like you failed tryna prove that last time. You went Rambo on him and he still walked out with his mask intact Lame ass movies
This is going to be great.
This series is so boring and predictable at this point.
Anyone else noticed the three Silver Shamrock masks in the trailer? Yeah, I got chills now.
He’s goin to survive again, no doubt about that
If you actually respect carpenters work, you would probably not be all that excited. But whatever. Enjoy a teenager and a walking corpse defeating what hundreds of armed, trained, professionals cannot.  Let's through in a baby too. Oh wait, maybe a dog with super powers and give Michael a mohawk!
Finally a continuation of a reboot I can fully get behind!  How did I miss that this was even in production?
This man’s still fucking alive
Damn this is probably gonna be the best Halloween timeline we’ve gotten lets be honest Halloween 2019 was s good wipe with the only movie connected was the original and this trailer looks 🔥
So excited!!
Man there's nobody like Michael Myers! Not Jason. Not Freddie, not ANYBODY!
Ну блин а я хотел русский трейлер
I actually really admire how they’re trying something new here. Cool.
Usrali cio film... Najbolja svi prva dva dijela deff
I'm starting to think Superman is under that mask.. 🤔
Holly shit , i think his died 😱
how cant yall catch this foo 🤣 we in 2021 not in the era of the zodiac killer🎥
I wonder if I set the line at 40 kills in Halloween kills. Would fans take the over    or under?  I’d say this, considering how many bodies there were after MM walked out of a burning house, I’m definitely taking the over.
Is John Carpenter producing tracks for this one too? That new violin add on to the track pack up more eerie punch to it!😩
Let the record show that Mikey is a normal human but has never been killed the fuccn G.O.A.T
Omo
RUD PAUL ..WERE IS HE ?
'Season of the Witch' references make me happy :)
Micheal meyers doesnt get old like his sister?
wow,great film  <3
Can they not just shoot him with an AK47 ?
Mf just 1v the whole fkn town holy
Imagine in the end they find the reason Jaimie survived so long is because she is immortal too.
I’m not gonna lie it would have to take a higher source of power to end micheal Myers for good. Because what I saw from this trailer, everyone does not stand a chance.
Seems good!
So you’re telling me that in America, where pretty much anyone can own a gun you can’t kill one psychopath, cmon
The fire fighter thing makes me angry
What is the music???? cool
Aw man why he gotta kill those old folk :(
https://youtu.be/NUQOyE4Hmxc
Shows us the whole movie why don't ya
Hade until "We fight ✊"
Trailer looks really good coming from someone who has been obsessed with Halloween since 2002, age 12...but why does the "take my hand" scene with the firefighters remind me of This Is the End with Jay and Seth? 🤣
I’m buy my ticket 🎫 now
Why do people making this movie?
Back in the hospital ( like in Part 2)…cool
Don't watch if you like suspense!!  Is this a trailer or a Spoiler??? I think most of the key characters and how he survived is in the 2mins+ trailer!
I literally just watched film theory how to beat michael myers.
My favorite horror film of all times, i still get scared till this day 😂
I would love to see a badass Karen before she dies, and a badass Allison in Halloween ends looking for revenge fighting next with her grandma.
Wouldn't Michael  be elderly as well? It would be more accurate if he was using a cane, while drinking prune juice complaining about everything under the sun.
Too many spoilers in 1 trailer though.  They've went to the trouble of bringing back all these legacy characters such as Lynsey Wallace, Sheriff Brackett and Marion Chambers and literally show them getting killed/dead in the trailer 🤷‍♂️ I still don't get why Michael Myers is supposed to give a shit who Laurie Strode is now that they aren't related and he seems to just be killing indiscriminately anyone who crosses his path.
Can’t wait....
How the fuck did he not die from the fire
Ok I can honestly say this movie is gonna freak me out lol
Very nice too see my hero back
I knew it... He dont die that easy
Hell yeah!!!
Only thing keeping alive myers is the cash studio earns with each installment
Surely this movie will be taking place on November 1st 🤔🤔
Myers will never die he will always keep coming back to haunt and kill those around him.
So your telling me curtis didn't account for fire fighters putting fire out.....
ITS MICHAEL FUCKING MYERSSSSSSSS
Ayolah kita bareng-bareng bunuhnya anjirrr kesel banget gua ama itu si copet
Where all my rhobh fans?? So crazy to see Kyle in this lol
Yes the legend is back baby yes I can't wait
What..wait..why..and I am a fan from decades back...come on people..  AREN'T WE TIIIIIIIIIIRED YET
Recommended?
"Evil dies tonight." Lol, not in this franchise.
How is Michael still a killing machine? They retconned the old sequels out of existence, but at least in Halloween 6 & onwards, Michael was undead.   But in this, he should be, what, 60? He's still human, but still racking up kills at an old age to the point that its Michael Myers VS the whole town in this one.
Where this dude be at till Halloween 🤷🏾‍♂️
Somehow I doubt evil will indeed die that night
Jason Nor Freddy Got nothing Against Michael
Omg they should just end it
Please just stop making this trash and just go fund anything more original.
So his clothes and mask are indestructible too? ...........
I know people desperately want to like it, but it looks like the much overrated 2018 version, just pumped full of more kills. That is, a bunch of references to the first batch of sequels, & an old Laurie vowing to kill Michael.
Wow this looks chilling. Cannot wait to watch it in the theater 🍿😱
I fee like I'm done with this movie. Just like the 2007 version, after I watch it I didnt even have the interest to watch the 2009 sequel.
Damn the beginning was showing everything 😂
I KNEW IT!
"I prayed he would burn in hell but in my heart, I knew hell would not have him". Dr. Loomis was indeed right.
Is this the trailer for the movie or some kind of a kill count?? I literally just saw EVERY kill in the movie! 🙄😤
Laurie: He can't kill us all. Micheal: (´-﹏-`；) -🔪
Somethings up the consaw never turns on after 1 pull
Is it just me or is this trailer badass 😱
Why???? Stop making  halloween again and again .... make new movie not old
Am I the only one who has a soft spot for firefighters and got sad when they were killed ?
Jason vs Michael is this possibly leading up to that is that ever going to happen all of us horror fanatics is waiting for it icon vs icon one final showdown and be done with it
I’m only here for Kyle
Lol the way everyone has watched the trailers more than any of the actual movies 😭😭😭
🤣 Micheal Myers The only dies In his movies and come back with a new one ever year 🔥😗😩😩😂
Is Micheal Myers chuck Norris???
I really hope they don't turn Michael into someone they just hunt down over the course of the movie that it turns into some B action flick.
awww ahit, here we go again.. :D
Myers said “Fuck it, I’m Rated E ...for Everybody now”
Of course, he survived that fire.
Its time to show his face!
I'm a huge fan of the original 1978 "Halloween" and I really enjoyed the 2018 sequel, so you can bet I'm excited to see "Halloween Kills" this October. Check out the amazing new trailer!  #HalloweenKills #HalloweenMovie #MichaelMyers #JamieLeeCurtis #horror #slasher
Why must we reboot the same movies ?   Year after year . Decade after decade.  😪
Evil dies tonight... Until the next sequel.
Let me guess the next film will be called Halloween kills again?
Enough w Jamie Lee…too old to be badass.
Feel like I just watched the whole damn movie.
Why does many horror movie have idiots
Damn, they really gonna spoil all the kills in the first trailer huh?
The thumbnail looks like biden after a large Indian meal
Meh - it looks so cheesy. They showed the whole movie in the trailer.
The 2018 was the best continuation of the original 2 movies and the fact that this one is right after they ended the last movie is perfect
Ohh shit
Just your typical bullshit movie that doesn’t kill any of the main characters
She knew better than to try and let him burn come on now ms Myers you got to blow him up or something lol
I feel so fucking bad for those poor firefighters
Finally, a Halloween movie that ties Season of the Witch into the rest of the Myers story line.
The defiant population architecturally seal because cd retrospectively prefer athwart a aquatic glue. parallel, fabulous pumpkin
They spoiled the scenes 🙃
Not scary.
If there’s any sort of homosexuality in this movie I ain’t watching. No need for sword fighting scenes.
Awesome trailer but once again I think you've revealed too much.
When we all are getting bored due to corona and lockdown. And no good movies are releasing. I thought this is the end. But now this movie trailer game me a hope. That 2021 is not so bad like 2020.
Man Jamie Lee Curtis still battling Michael Myers.....its been going on for over 35 years and she still can't get rid of his ass lol
I'd be lying if I said this film has promise. Doesn't mean I'm not looking forward to it.
It’s not Halloween unless there’s a new Michael Myers movie out. Can’t fuckin wait!!
I love the first part...
Idiotic at that point
I knew it was going to be another one FINALLY
The fact that Jamie is still doing this and there’s an Akkad production along with John Carpenter makes these late sequels really kick ass. Can’t wait to see this one!
Everyone: "HOW THE F**K DID HE NOT DIE, WHAT THE F**K"   **ong Michael just built different"
I want Michael to kill me like that
Now every one of folks at that town wanna a piece of Michael Myers 😂
So many eggs from previous Halloween movies in this one trailer
Sweet! Another Halloween movie. I wonder whats gonna happen... Wait, nevermind.
I feel like this just isn't scary anymore after a year of BLM riots.
Michael at the Villian Pub Michael: So yah I killed a whole town killed my arch-nemesis and her whole family and now I can kill whoever I want
I'm coming for you Michael 🔥🔥🔥
We all know he gonna survive crazy part is if he’s gonna kill the whole town.. pretty cool that scene where he walked out there was no hiding just toe to toe 😂
They basically just spoiled the entire movie, so you already know who's he gonna kill
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Bringing elements from part 3 has me very interested
John Carpenter returned to retcon the crap we got after the original and give a fitting end to the franchise. Now sadly they discovered they could milk the franchise further for money.
At this point any instrument playing the holloween theme should signify your fucked in the worst kind of way, a "Michael" way.
Laurie: "No no no! Let him burn!" Firefighters: "Oh okay, alright! Let's turn around.  Movie ends.
oh this gon be dope
A manhunt for Michael sounds sick but, you don't send sheep to take care of a wolf. This movie is going to be bloody and I'm going to LOVE IT!!!
0:02 where is John wick ?
This is why you should bring DS So you are not getting tunneled
Immortal huh We need John Wick this movie is need him haha
Everyone​: OMG​ I​'M​ SO​ HYPE Jason​ voorhees​: *rotting​ at​ bottom​ of​ the​ crystal​ lake*
"He can hurt anyone again"  Litterally the title says halloween kills
How many times they gonna the same wack stuff over and over again
The being of terror has chosen his champion once more
I guess you can't let a classic die. All the best horror movies were made in the 70's and 80's. Horror movies today just don't seem to matchup.
Enough of this crap.
Laurie you said it all would end a long time ago now where are back at the starting point I’m just gonna leave town now I think it’s safer for me that way
Yawns
Nba finds out that Micheal is 6’7   Adam Silver………………. And wit the first pick in the 2022 draft the Chicago bulls select Micheal Myers from the state of Illinois
They better his face this time we already saw Jason Voorhees ugly mug
Wait didn’t Jamie Lee Curtis die like a couple films back?
He just finished his evil within 3
Just drop a pallet in front of him.
CAN'T WAIT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This movie has been a year over due can't wait!!
that boy ain’t playing lol
Nice the Theme changed
Judging by the dead body with the H3 Witch Mask, I think Nurse Marion's gonna get killed.
Bro honestly it’s not hard to beat Michael just have the world ban Halloween cus that’s like only when he shows up
This looks like it’s gonna be better than the one in 2018 damn ! Lol
This is the same guy that put his thumb thru some guys  forehead , MM is a horror legend💯💯💯💯
Guys this is truly the moment Walter Jr became a Flower!
Seriously.... Even after 43 years?
It's literally only one person why is that so hard to kill him lmao
Brasil we love you 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷 halloween foddda
Ulalaahh señor francés!
The whimsical test putatively gaze because way unexplainably surround beside a healthy cotton. illustrious, inexpensive cell
Are those the marks from season of the witch on those people?
This guy is immortal
YYEESSSSSSS!!!!!  I CAN'T WAIT, MICHAEL MYERS IS BACK!!!!
da homie better not die 😈😈
So the whole neighborhood is finally done with Michael's antics?
We need the real Babayaga.
THIS 1 KINDA LOOK MORE ENTERTAINING CAUSE I DIDNT FIND THAT THE LAST 1 WAS
I liked the masks he used on the ppl he killed. Little Easter eggs from Halloween 3 season of the witch.
The never ending saga of Michael Myers! AKA Halloween! I’ve been watching him since 1978 and he’s a prolific killer!
You want your mask?  Me: Okay, Movie added to watch list!
Anyone notice the silver shamrock masks from Halloween 3 that is such a beautiful call back
Michael Myers better John wick it up and kill all of them
👎👎👎👎👎
Bruhhhhh my 2 fav killers got a movie together
John Carpenter should have a restraining order against making corny ass horror movies. Just end it already man 😒
This movie seems to add life to the series. All of the other movies featured the main cast reacting to Michael and everyone else seemingly responding only after finding a body or something. With this movie painting Michael as a killer that the whole town is after gives it grit and realism... At least in the Michael Myers franchise
Why can't Michael Myers just kill off this series of movies already. That'd be the real winner and ending 👏
Trailer ruins the movie
Looks fuckin dope my only problem with it tho is i feel like we just watched like 3 quarters of all the kills in the movie. Either this movie is gonna have a ridiculously high body count (which has never happened in Halloween) or we just watched all the good parts
Showed way to much in this trailer but im still excited!! Seen 5+ people die in this trailer damn
I wished he kill everyone and shut this fake world down
We might finally see the face of evil. 😅
we can not kill him
I'm glad mostly everyone seems hyped for this, but for some reason this trailer didn't do anything for me... kind of showed too much and the firefighters just standing in line to get murdered seemed kinda dumb. Glad one fought back at least lol man I really really really want to like this but again, just not hyped. Is something wrong with me? Lol I feel like Stan in that south park episode where all he sees is shit 🤦😂😭
This film is going to be so epic I can't wait to watch this :)
I watched the 2018 version in the theater.  I enjoyed it.  Now, it's just a money grab.  Count me out.  Shame on John Carpenter.  He was one of my heroes.  Not anymore.
They got me wondering if Michael Myers and Laurie gonna kill each other
More unnecessary sequels
I'm there!
When is he finally going to meet Abbot and Costello? Is that in the next one?
Nobody:   People: “Myers will die tonight”  Myers: “So you have chosen… DEATH”
Omg i love this I'm so hype
Who know who Michael can’t kill? Family.
Jamie Lee Curtis.. nuff said.
2:30 just saw the movie
Yea this one gone be fye I didn't like the last one
Let's goooo i can't wait until it comes out
This looks amazing
Not again????????
I was kinda hoping they would end it with the reboot since it ended really well, but if this mf is about to murder the whole town I'm so in for yet another sequel
Can’t fvckn wait!!!!!!
Not a single sniper in the town: too bad!
https://youtu.be/Yq3TvWG6rAo
HOW MANY MORE SEQUELS ARE GONNA BE MADE???
Bro made it outta gulag jus to kill his sister
Cmon Michael not the old people. Do better
Not time our boy got done kill counts and the variety of kills is awesome too. Actually defending himself is badass and scary
the whole town gathers to hunt the wolf, but this is not an ordinary wolf
Ooohhhh siiiii!!!!!
COVID: I am the pandemic of slaughter  Michael: Hold my knife
They put the masks from 3 in there also lmao
Looks pretty damn good
A man couldn't have survived? The fireman fell through the floor and it wasn't an inferno. I'm pretty sure he would have survived if Michael hadn't been down there.
"Machete will return in *MACHETE KILLS*...and *MACHETE KILLS AGAIN*"
Just kill him already omg, these movies just drag on. Let me guess there's gonna be another sequel 🙄
👍📺👀             👍📺👀
This is just getting sad how many remakes are being done. No original ideas anymore just keep pumping out the same shit.
Can anybody tell me what they're chanting? It sounds like they're saying "we want blood".
Just move to Hawaii, I mean what's he gonna do buy a plane ticket lol
I love that Jamie is always SO SMAAAAART
I coulda swore i saw a group about to beat that mans ass hard as fuxk
I'm 30 and this movie still gives me the chills, cause me to have nightmares and afraid someone is going to pop out from around a corner in a Michael Myers Halloween mask...FUUUUUHHHH. #CanHardlyWait
Jason has the Most Kills                                                                                               :Michael “Hold My Blade”
Oh and thank you for showing us the whole movie! I think we saw 75% of his kills! Please let this be the last one.
They gotta have a Halloween maze at universal studios for horror nights now 😮‍💨
Yo he never dies yo 💀
I hope we see some stealth Michael what I mean by that is how he hangs onto the pole with one hand and lowers himself if you know you know only real HALLOWEEN fans know
So we don't have to watch the movie now, right? lol
“You can’t kill the boogeyman.”
Yoo those silver shamrock masks tho 👌🏻
Please make something NEWWWWW!!!!! I’m tired of RE-MAKES
Did didn't care for the last one they need to pick up on a storyline from the first Halloween movie and the second one and the fourth and the fifth this just doesn't cut it not as good as the other ones
this is gonna be fucking amazing
I love Michael Myers movies, can’t wait to see it
Micheal Myers Hated and feared by civilians  Loved by Funeral homes
What's common between Micheal Myers and a tiger?  When you spot them, they probably watching you for minutes.
Bruh they really showed so many fucking kills in this trailer….marketing team ruined most of the movie already.
What's common between Micheal Myers and a tiger?  When you spot them, they probably watching you for minutes.
The town has a bunch of beta males still letting Michael whoop their ass for over a decade.
YESSSSS
Now this is epic
Nice touch with the Silver Shamrock masks in the trailer. I'm excited for this movie!
When’s F13 gonna get a killer reboot
Other savage killing from michael meyers. Cant wait this october.
Holy shit I can’t remember the last time I was this excited for a movie
He can’t kill anyone anymore…  Mike: Allow me to reintroduce myself…..
And he’d still lose to Dominic Torretto.
was gonna say they spoiled every kill in the trailer but i bet that was not even 25%
He should stand trial
Yo They gotta bring back Busta rhymes so he can go full on street fighter on Michael Myers
An a weak but empowered old woman will kill a fucking super strong and evil bastard like Michale Myers???? give me a break 😂
This looks fucking sickk!
Another one ☝️
Damn, all those kills and now I seen the whole movie. That long ass trailer.
MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE HORROR MOVIE...I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS LAST GO-ROUND!
Kind of a corny name right?
0:14
Hell yeah!!!
This man just doesn’t die
This the whole movie .. we already see who kills .. shit i didnt even see the last one dang .. this need to be the end tho frfr
Can’t wait to watch on HBO MAX
Condelence to  the fire department
Wow, this trailer gave me the chills. It looks like this Halloween for sure will be a Kill thrill. The trail of blood ends at his childhood home.
*monkey noises intensifies*
I am actually shocked at how plausible the excuse for Michaels return is, the old movies were like eh an old hermit nursed him back to health.
“Michael Myers is a escaped mental patient. Freddy and Jason, different kind of movie. “
I knew it when the fartgas came into play
Wow...Michael Meyers did NOT die in the basement of a 4 alarm barn-burner of a house fire 🔥?!?!?  I'd like to say, "I did not see that coming...", but then again, Laurie took his head clean off with an axe 🪓 in H20, sooooo....
Honestly that dude must’ve killed 50 people in a two minute trailer. Still can’t understand why when a guy who walks slower than a snail can’t be shot up before the time he actually approaches someone?
Another Halloween movie???  Give it a rest already.
He already got bout 10 bodies in this trailer alone 🤣 he bouta go nuts...that fire pissed him all the way off
Jamie Lee Curtis is the Legendary Scream Queen
Awaiting
Bad ass!
That scream Jaime Lee Curtis does LET IT BURN. This movie is gonna be great
Mr Myers you the man 🔪
This looks hyper-violent. I like it!
As a firefighter myself, I don't think I would've fought I would've gotten everyone in the truck and taken off lol
They could of really went without making this movie. It's beyond ridiculous at this point that apparently not a single person is a decent enough shot to just shoot him in the head and be done with it.
“ A man couldn’t have survived that fire” Michael controls black Air Force energy
Gotta love the little reference to Halloween 3
This is gonna be lit
2:00 Kyle Richards babyyy😍❤️
I think where he kills in the beginning it's when he kills those doctors on Halloween 6
This is how you reboot a franchise.. hopefully they stop after this.
Of course I am going to watch it. But I don't really like this new version.  1. There is not any reason for this to continue in this new story line. There is no connection to them . Only that she was one of the ones he didn't get to kill in the original  movies. 2. In my opinion,  the story line of H20 was good. She had a son. Now there was 2 blood relatives he had to remove from existence. Made sense as to why Michael  is still alive and on a killing spree. He has to finish the job... 3. In  Halloween  Resurrection.  Instead of killing of if Laurie Strode they should of made it look like she died and have her go into hiding. While Michael finds the son and his family and tries to kill them. She would come back. As the bad bitch that she is to the rescue. And have an all out battle. That would of left both dead at the end. And that would of ended the characters  Michael  and Laurie. ... And that would of been how I would of finished off this movie trilogy... any thoughts anyone???
Plot twist- COVID kills Michael. Credits scene advertises Moderna. Halloween series dies
My Favorite movie of all time right here.
After 30+ years have they never thought of headshotting the guy ?
Я один из России жду этот фильм?
شو هالفلم البيض
Holy crap, the victims are wearing Silver Shamrock masks!
Finally
Funny how she always says that she going to finally end it all "tonight!"
E é o Jason é? Um monte de bombeiro com machado e serra não conseguiu parar um cara??
Do you not have a police service over there to sort him out. Instead of members of the public?
Michael to the moon 🌚
Gaaarbage  Theres only 3 Halloween movies......the first 3
The trailer fucking showed some stuff i aint watching it
This one of the best trailers I’ve seen in a very long time. Holy shit this looks so goood!!!!!!!
End of the trailer has me curious, how will Jamie recognize Michael without the mask? Must be for a brief second where he has it off.
The stealthy killer is back Who loves the theme song
James A. Janisse is finna have a field day with this one.😂 So hyped!!!
Michael really said “fuck that Laurie hoe this whole town boutta get it”
The hunter is maybe gana get hunted
I hope the third one is a remake of season of the witch
Why must they show everything in the damn trailer? I feel I've seen 75% of the movie just by the watching a 2 min clip.
Waiting for this and the forever purge 🔥
How long are they going to drag this on?
Felt bad for the Units that had to respond to the fire.
Finally ... Final ... 🤔?
Another dumpster fire of a movie I see
I think I just saw the entire film...
"The NeverEnding Story"
“I’m coming for you Michael “ 😂been saying that since the 90s
$10 says he doesn’t die, or if he does, he comes back in the next movie
Here we go again... again
Oh fuck yes
I hope he gets the scalpers first
It's annoying to see that he just keep on coming back over and over.
I feel like I watched the whole movie just by watching this trailer.
Okay this one looks legit enough bad ass I'll go see it
Halloween wouldn’t stand a chance against me
I really cannot wait! It’s gonna be awesome! Michael Myers is gonna be as powerful as ever!!!
Just by this trailer alone I still don’t get why the firefighters didn’t charge at him all at once🤦‍♂️
I have question who would win Michael myers or Jason, because i don't know they are kinda similar  like who would win
The Sound mixing is off the chart for this film 10/10
Michael Myers and Halloween used to be spooky and gave u those creepy slow scares and thrills. Ever since Rob zombie ruined the franchise, people just try and make a cool rock n roll version on him with gory kills, and no scares really.
“He can’t hurt anyone again”  Michael: “Oh I am sorry, I was a little busy hurting someone, what did you say?”
I used to be scared until I heard rated r by redman
So I’m kinda hoping Laurie rubs Karen and Allyson’s noses in it. Like “yeah who’s crazy now, bitches?”… 🧾
This Michael Myers Dude have lived longer than every boogeyman in the past and present. Dammit!
Godlyyyy
"What do we do now?"  "We fight!"  "When did fighting ever work?" lol
Somewhere out there James a janisse is getting ready for this Halloweens kill count.
Damn Michael is extremely skilled
Chile, Micheal Myers been killing and dying for over 40 years now. I can’t.  🥴
They really still making these
Who are here after CITIZEN Z
This looks so damn scary and intense
But Michael was burned down alive in that underground room in the first place right.....how tf is he alive😂😂
What fear nonsense nonsense
Michael kills. Everytime, everywhere.
how could a concept so simple.. still be so dominant in this horror meta.
Wow they straight showing the kills
….. *well there screwed*
Jamie Lee ... Nós somos seus fãs...🤜💥🤛👌
I love, LOVE, how he took those firefighters down. Like that is so fucking badass. And hilarious that they couldn't stop him.
Always wears a mask and has killed more people than Covid 🤘😎
Is this gonna be one of the most gruesome horror movies ever made cause damn that’s the most I’ve seen since forever
They didn’t do too well with the Marketing of this Movie. They shown a little too much of the movie, which will kinda spoil it, yk? But I’m excited either way to see it!
AH SHIT IM READY
1st time I can’t complain they showed too much lol. Cause cmon! Let’s go! Finally!!!!
I will never understand the purpose of a horror film, it just makes us see things when we shouldn't
Lmao
HOLY F****NG HELL! THIS LOOKS FIREEEEEE!
I saw this in a test screen.   The end of the movie, Laurie's daughter has a gun against Michael's head about to pull the trigger when Laurie stops her and says something along the lines of "No, don't.   Dr (forgot his name) called.  Michael has hypertension.  Without medical treatment it's a death sentence."   And they both just walk away leaving Michael to succumb to the world's most deadly killers - heart disease.   It fades to black and the words "The End" show up on the screen.   But seconds later a "?" pops up making you wonder if Laurie did the right thing by letting Michael die off screen, on his own.
The Sheriff of this town: The dude with a mask massacre our town again, so what should I do, cancel Halloween?  *Laughs manically*
Yooooo all out war against Mike Myers I’m all for it lol.  This should be great
Laurie - I'm Coming for You Michael LAURIE IS A TOTAL BADASS CAN'T WAIT
1:34 I wonder if this was a reference to the 3rd movie including the witch mask.
Is Michael Myers now Jason lol
Where the fuck is John Wick? We need him here.
Since this is a trilogy I can’t wait for it to end on a cliffhanger and wait 3 more years
This should be good 🍿
All fire fighters are just standing making faces, waiting to be killed by that casual walking thing. No running, no sign of struggle. No sight of police, law enforcement. No use of guns, grenades, rocket launchers, missiles, nuclear bomb. This is just wow.
I could have sworn John Carpenter died in 2018 ... I swear this is not my fkin timeline
Bruh he burned twice and didn’t die his will he finally die
Not gonna lie, the way this trailer starts with her saying "NO, LET HIM BUUURN" gave me chills. Nice work. Hopefully this is the last one though lol
Aint no stopping the inevitable
Did I just saw the whole movie minus the ending?
Alright, this is why the tombstone offerings should be retired. See what happens when he reaches tier 3!!
Michael Myers is ruthless in this movie, sheesh.
This is so cliche, im done with this money making franchise
After the surprisingly sensational reboot of Halloween, you best believe that I'm going to happily spend my hard earned money on a ticket to this. Jamie, I'm counting on you to not let me down😉🤞
Dead meat waiting like this 👀:
Yay a new movie of this im so 😁 excitied
Michaels kill streak continues 🙈
trailer showed too much
holy shit im excited
How many more do they need of these haha 😂😂😂
I’ve never seen so many kills in. Trailer. AMAZING !!
We can finally see his true power
Last Halloween movie was bullshit they rushed that shit to put out on Halloween no love was given into the movie hopefully they took their time with it this time around or we gonna have a problem I’m slapping all producers
Oh Dead Meat James is gonna have a fun time doing a kill count on this for sure
this looks fucking terrible.
He's just misunderstood
Rob Zombie's version was way better
I've never been interested in ANY of the Halloween movies. But holy shit this one actually looks good!!!!!!!!!!!
Buy etherum
And I thought for sure Michael Myers died off screen at the end of the last movie.   I'm so shocked to see he survived.
Let it die already.  This is like the 42nd installment 🙄
why does hollywood feel the need to make unnecessary sequels
WHY DID THEY SHOW SO MANY KILLS!?!?!?!?   I HATE TRAILERS
Didn't Jamie Lee cut that dude's head off like 20 some years ago?  Who's the evil shithead that reattached it?
I thought he died in the last one because he got burned but he never dies
Somebody bring Nanno or Man-wol to handle the situation PLEASE-
Black folks in this movie R.I.P. 👀
Damn, this should be how they end the series.
keep running this franchise into the ground unbelievable
I liked Halloween 2018, this one looks meh. Surviving that fire.... yeah right, stupid!
I think this has gone on long enough
“He can’t hurt anyone again”  Michael Myers: 14 movies later
Ok why does he look like Joe Biden
Micheal Vs Town and he going to win 🤣🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥
Omg I am so excited to see the best horror movie to come in theaters again. Micheal Myers! We now unleash you.
Anybody here from 1978?
1978-2021 and counting.
"The more he kills the more he transcends" Epic line
A mob against Michael Myers. Well, it's original.
1:27 There's another movie
HELL FUCKING YEAH.  This looks so damn bad ass.  Definitely seeing it.
He's back bitches 🥰
Oh this is going to be a very good movie. Michaels going to slaughter a mob
This trailer is showing too much of movie 💯 still cant wait for it
God damn he ain't dead yet ?
This reminds me sooo much of Rob Zombie version but I’ll give it a shot lol
Alright, the 11th Halloween movi- oh shit he's got a new mask, we're screwed
I’m his great Niece I know he taking out the whole Town. Don’t know bout his sister tho she out to get his Ass. She on that Ass…….
All they need to do is follow these steps to survive a horror movie  1. Never have sex  2. Never drink or do drugs 3. Never ever ever say you’ll be right back because you won’t be back
Im good as long as rob zombie isnt directing this one. He destroyed the last two. He is a garbage director. All in all. These reboots are just played out. No one will make a reboot as goid as the original movies
Let this series end!
Heck yeah!!! Can't wait!! Elated that Jamie Lee Curtis is in it. This is going to be awesome!!!
Sh*t, now Michael Myers is pulling a John Wick.
Imagine how Michael the Archangel is viewed by this wicked world
He could never die because he is a legend
Trash…
Feel bad for those fire fighters man
Wait is it technically still Halloween night alot has happened in 24 hrs lol
Since Halloween ends (the last of the trilogy) is the 13th Halloween, can Michael finally meet Jason in what would be the 13th as well.
Listen, folks. Why don't we end this franchise once and for all? He died in that fire. That's it. End of story.
The whole town against Myers?  I'm in.  Next up: the whole world, then the whole universe.
Michael looks MAD in this movie I mean I'm not saying he hasn't before, but he lookin like he sayin " forget Laurie...I'm killing this whole town and everyone or anyone who gets in my way ".
Michael myers es mi asesino favorito
Spoilers man
Lloyd Banks should do the soundtrack "Halloween Havoc 4"...🔥🔥🔥🔥
I feel like this is going back to its roots
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I FREAKING CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE!!!!!!! EPIC!!!! JUST WOW!!!!!
I’ll be seeing you all this Halloween 🎃🔪
The boogey man is alive     John wick rises
I just really want Michael Myers in Mortal Kombat 11 already
The more he kills, the more he transcends.     *Michael has reached Evil Within tier 4*
Will this be in hbo
The legend laurie strode
Fuuuuckkk I can’t wait for this one!
Who else got chills when LAURIE said “ LET HIM BURN “ uffffff
Can't wait to that one it's gonna be good.
*LET IT BURN!!!!!*
They literally showed the whole movie
Michael Myers is a goat I love that man
I bet this trailer is mostly deleted scenes of the movie . probably half of what we just saw isn't gonna be in the movie
When john carpenter is back u know shit bout to get real... And be damn awesome he knows what he is doing so I can't wait for this one!!
Man.. I m kinda tired of Michael dealing mostly with normal people. Wish they brought another character as some kind of force of good.. or even an evil-ish one as Jason. Do a versus movie and.. LET THEM FIGHT! (as Jason vs Freddy once did)
This movie is gonna be amazing Michael only gets more bad ass
I don’t get it, for the previous movie they asked us to forget all the slasher sequels and pick up from the original Halloween movie……now we start all over again with slasher sequel movies. Why?
These movies suck. Whatever happened to original ideas?
How old is Michael, 78?
Dang he ain't dead yet
What the hellllll👀
This is exactly why we have the second amendment 🔫 well at least when there handled by real people, not these actors 😂
Cool I definitely have to watch.
Ok, didn't watch the last one because I didn't like how they skipped all of the other movies where she had a daughter and a son. But this does look interesting. My money is on Michael😆
Laurie Strode: "Evil Dies Tonight"   Wikipedia: *A direct sequel, Halloween Ends, is scheduled to be released on October 14, 2022.*  Me: .............aRe YoU sUrE aBoUt ThAt?
COVID-19: The Myers Varient.
Now that one looks finally good. Most of them a quite boring.
Wow number 14 on trending
After this one holloween it’s one more too
I think Laurie is going to die in this one and her daughter and grand daughter will become her and fight Micheal, or at the very last movie, next year, she kills Micheal and as he is dying he stabs her or something and they both die together
Ohhhhhhh shitttttt he flipppppped out big tyme
Can’t wait to see the new movie of Michael
"The more he kills the more he trescends" gives me chills
anyone else see the Halloween mask from Halloween 3: season of the witch. That was a cool little Easter egg

I'm in
Halloween one and only ..Best movies .. 🌟
Looks pretty cool actually 👍🏽
funny how I hear Michael Myers and Dr. Evil pops in my head.
Horror movies look more n more cold blooded respect its entertainment gangsta no cap lol stay safe RIP Paul Mooney BLM God bless stop all dis hate checkout The Main Squeeze 🙏
Michael can get nuked and they’ll still make series going
Damn Mike old asl now and he still out here killin mofos😂😂😂🤦‍♀️
Ok you know what!!! I am so tired of this shit!!! Firemen are not push over punks!!! They are warriors that fight fire... They stay at the peak of fitness and tend to work as a team... You wanna tell me... I am supposed to suspended reality and believe that michael.. Who is just a man.... Took out about five of them... Even with injuries from the previous movies?!?! Oh come on now!!! I hope the movie does well and Jamie kicks Ass but... I am not paying to watch this money grab. Next he will be giving Thor an ass whipping.
Damn that’s tiff

Micheal has transcended, his soul can die, his body can die but his legend will live forever
He's back he's fixing back in pandemic 🤣

Judy Greer is everything!!

This releases on my birthday, I know what I'm seeing
Yessirrrrrr
Michael's fucking pissed
Looks like the body count is gonna be super high in this movie
goosebumps!
This finna be amazing
I wonder if an m60 machine gun will be able to kill michael myers? Drop his ass in warzone we go deal with that.
Til this day, I’ve never seen him run.
Dayum freaky
Can’t wait for this in a packed theatre.
They showed all of the good kills in the trailer
So this movie shows how dumb fireman really are?
Oh come on give it a rest. Halloween  1 and 2 were fantastic then the money hungry idiots ruined it by franchising its fame into the same repetitive crap.
2 days. 2 million views. Wonder if we were all antsy to see the trailer 😂
The Halloween 2 follow up we should’ve gotten instead of the one we got. (Yes this is considered the 3rd… but Halloween 2 was trash)
anyone else think michael myers is gonna take out the whole town??? thats what its looking like lol
Are we gonna do 50 million halloween movies ,,,,,ORIGINALITY ?
Bruh of course they gonna make another one lmao. I’m not complaining tho I love the Halloween movies.
Talk about squeezing every cent of profit out of the consumer…. This Halloween franchise is literally endless. Michael will be resurrected so many times hell eventually be going after his great great grand daughter….
Didnt this dude get his head chopped off in one of these movies? Was it a fake myers or something? Lol
Oh man, I hope that side characters that are only there to be killed talk more about Vietnamese sandwiches.
I saw the trailer yesterday thank you Universal Studios for making us fans happy this movie trailer delivers badass trailer of all time. I hope we can see the same for Halloween ends. Even greater.🤡🎈🎃🔪👻🍿🍫🥤
Scary thing is, Michael doesn’t care about pursuing Laurie in this timeline. He kills whoever stands in his way.
Still 4 months away ugh!!!!
Crazy to think that even Michael Myers wouldn't have prevented skyrocketing property prices in Haddonfield
Bruh they high-key showed all the kills
This one is going to be awesome
Imagine tryna take a shit and watching this its not coming out
Imagine the thoughts going through the firemen heads while watching Jason walking out
Why is Myers so pressed for he needs a vibe check rq
About time they just jumped him lol.
This man is an abomination to mankind, take my money 💵
No fxkn way abother fxkn one is coming out my boy deserves a medal more than jason lol ive been Michael myers for over 4 5 years for Halloween☺
Please stop making such violence promoted movies as this generates psychotic behaviours n killings in the world 🥺
They should have all listened to Dr. Loomis. RIP Donald Pleasence.
Micheal “John Wick” Myers
I forget .... is this movie new ???
Michael can't die right? He's been killed few times
Some budy in there, 😅
Stop re making movies 😐
I just watched the entire movie thanks 😅
They're (the writers/producers/execs) are gonna do something stupid like Michael losing his mask and escaping because nobody knows what he looks like, aren't they? Or the mask/curses takes someone else and becomes the next MM.  Something fucking dumb and cliche because horror movies are allergic to actual ENDINGS.
What the fuck kinda title is this? Halloween kills? That’s like if I made a movie that took place on Valentine’s Day and called it “valentines loves”. Oh, and it has Michael Myers. Why not do something different with franchise? Maybe have new characters and new killers? Oh wait because you fucks were too childish to give a new idea a chance and completely ruined the Halloween 3 idea
Fast and Furious 10 vs Michael Myers
I can't wait to see this one. The last one was really great. It just sucks that I watched the trailer because it's badly made. They showed so much of the movie. I know it's silly to care about the plot in a slasher but... some mystery would be nice.
Michael Myers ohw to catch up to Jason Voorhees’ career-long kill count:
When the trailer is actually an entire spoiler… like wtf were they thinking
The entire town of Haddonfield: “Let’s go hunt him down!”  Michael Myers: *”It’s free real-estate😏”*
I’m so happy they have been able to re-invent the series again. I was scared I’d never see Halloween good again.
Should have called it "Speed Kills"
Holy crap  its like purge every body wanna purge Michael  😂😂 looks awesome
He's Back!!!!
YES YES YES
With how good the last one was I have high hopes for this one
Looks stupid
cringe
“Welcome to the kill count, where we tally up the victims in all our favorite horror movies!”
I know it’s Mikey Myers, but isn’t this man supposed to be like 75 years old?
Ayyyyeeeee...this looks lit!
I like to see that they're still using the Silver Shamrock masks from Halloween 3: Season of The Witch. Nice little homage. 🎃
I’m surprised that woke Hollywood didn’t turn Michael Myers into a lesbian black woman
wow
How they let this old ass man kill all of them. As old as he is they should be able to push this fool down and cause him to slip a disk.
John Wick is surely the man you send to kill the boogeyman
Sigh….
I’m excited for the part where she is yelling about his mask
Myers using hex indying, haunted ground and no ed.
He’s looks like he’s in great shape. Great foot work and he’s agile. NFL scouts will be going crazy when this movie comes out
Damn ain't he bout 80 by now? Still killing ppl
Make better trailers that don’t show the whole movie. Already got to see the whole thing for free
Hell yes to Lindsay Wallace aka Kyle and Nurse Marion Wittington!
Jesus! Show all the fucking kills why don't you. I don't even need to watch the damn thing now. Also am I the only one who thinks that name is horrible? What does that even mean? Makes no sense.
"Evil dies tonight!.....again... but this time I really mean it.... didn't you hear the music as I said it!? This time is for good!"
Man, how come the poor fire fighters had to get got g, what they do but just try and help poor Michael 😂
Not even covid can take my man Michael down!
Notice how she said  “LET *IT* BURN”
" He can't hurt anyone again "   Micheal Myers: oh, so I'm a joke to y'all now??
Why do they show the entire movie in the trailer now
ok i will try to hold my excitement in because everything I have ever known or cared about lately has been delayed so yeh.
Bro took on the whole fire squad 😳
Take my munnnay!
So he’s immortal then right?  I thought the whole point of Halloween 2018 was to bring back the whole “Michael Myers is just a blank slate of a human being and not a supernatural being who can survive ridiculous amounts of damage.”  This guy is in his mid 60’s,  he just lost some fingers from a gunshot, survived a fire that started in the basement (where he was)  then engulfed the entire house, got hit by a car, got stabbed I believe,  and is somehow just continuing his murder spree with no recovery whatsoever.  It’s going to be hilarious watching the writers justify how an entire town of people hunting Michael Myers can’t find and kill him when he’s just a severely injured mid 60’s aged man walking from house to house just stabbing people.  This movie should end in about 10 minutes if the police in Haddenfield aren’t complete fucking morons.
Perma Tier-3 Myers I see...
This looks damn good. Jamie Lee Curtis is overrated as hell, though.
This year's Halloween is gonna more favorable to my liking...
Brah noooooooooooooo Michael killed lil man’s parents. They have to make the third sequel about him growing up hunting Michael down or something
The one and only Michael thee Myers!!!
Brah how tf is 7 against one and y’all still get killed🤦🏾‍♂️. He ain’t immortal anymore
“He can’t hurt anyone again”  Micheal: and I took that personally.
Nmms ya para qué veo la película.
the ending to the last movie is now pointess because he's back again
These movies never disappoint me, Michael Shall live !!🎃
Idk why this looks like it’s gonna be better than 2018
Mr. Sandman.....bring me a dream,,,dum dum dum dum......
Michael Myers was like "You know what? Fuck this! Fuck those three girls! Fuck everyone! If everyone wants the smoke, then I'll give it to them!"
This already looks better than the last outing for Michael. Still miss the late Donald pleasance.
2:10  I know what you did to her phone
Evil dies tonight……  Doesn’t realize that an additional sequel has already been green lit
He killing everybody with ONE hand lol
2:00 I love that shot combined with the trailer music.
More like  Halloween The Apocalypse of Haddonfield
Yessssss
Stop. Stop making halloween movies.
Please, show us all the good parts before seeing the movie. Thanks
if she dont kill him this time, I think im going to have to step in
Can't Wait!!!
That Halloween 3 Easter egg though
Bet you michael wouldn't kill John wicks dog though
Strongest senior citizen alive
"Evil....dies.... TONIGHT." *sees that there's one more sequel after this one* The lie detector determined.... that was a lie.
You gots to be kidding they don’t wanna let this dude be over with!
Preeeetttty ballsy to taunt him with his own mask.
And yet Jason And Freddy can't drop another movie 🤦🏻‍♂️
The real question.  Is it woke or Dope?
I'm rootin for Michael.
At first i had an issue with Lori just letting Michael burn without seeing it to the end, but seeing this trailer watching how some people are trying to fight back and take him down is got me hyped up. Having every kill make him stronger is a clever way of closing some “ oh he wouldn’t have survived that” moments, addressing that now he’s technically not human anymore. Looking forward to seeing this movie.
Hell yeah can’t wait
Why haven’t they put Michael Myers into Mortal Kombat 11 seriously he's terrifying, he shows no mercy and best of all you don't need to look for a voice actor because he never talks. And to all those who think he shouldn’t be there Mortal Kombat added Kratos, Freddy Krueger, Alien, Predator, Jason Voorhees, Leatherface, The Terminator, Spawn, RoboCop, Rambo and even brought back The Joker and 5 of them are horror movie characters. So why not add him to Mortal Kombat 11?
I have absolutely no words. They just keep knocking it out of the park. Jason used to be my guy and Friday the 13th was my fav movie but not anymore. I am so excited to see this movie
I'm a HUGE Halloween fan! And I've been so irritated ever since they started remaking the original. I bet they're gonna screw this one up as well,, the way that they've done all of the newer versions. Just leave Mike alone. Even the previews aren't impressive. 🙄
Halloween 2056: as you can see Michael is sitting on his wheel chair menacingly
If you look carefully the dead person with the witch mask on is Marion chambers
*"The more he kills, the more he transcends." He should try Transcendental Meditation. Much less effort.*
When was the last time he drank water? How is he still alive, make it make sense.
500 to 1 aka Michael Myers  When Michael Myers dies (possibly won’t die) there will be only 2 people left out of 500
I want to know Mike’s secret to his strength.... Dude seems to be stronger than everyone he gets in contact with.
The free clinic: Let It Burn
I got chills holy shitttt
If he kills 15,000 in this trailer, imagine how many he racks up over the movie
I disagree with the description a little bit the reason why Halloween 2018 was massive huge successful is because of us fans who loyal kept supporting the franchise even Jamie Lee Curtis who loves all of us fans all of us are truly reason why this franchise has endure it fair share of ups and downs.This kind of insult to all genders and pretty much every single fan as gender doesn't play factor on why movies are successful but I forget Hollywood is obsessed with gender.
I wish they could do the same for Jason and Freddy but they keep messing them up, these last few Halloween movies Were actually pretty decent and it shows how the franchise has grown throughout the years it’s crazy how they took something so old and made it look so brand new.
I feel like I just saw the whole movie
Omg is anyone else excited for this cause I am
Do it! Kill everyone!
CandyMan and Halloween . Damnn
I can't wait.
Do I have to watch the last Halloween to understand what's going on?
Frankenstein vibes
When she takes his mask of 2 things could happen 1. He could try to kill everyone and the cops come and arrest him then the man in the black coat gets him out of jail.. 2. He doesn't get his mask back and the man in the black coat helps him escape the house..
How on earth are they letting a 64 year old kill them like this🤷🏾‍♂️
This looks GOOD wooah
I’ve been waiting for this forever 🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧
Just wiped out tomato town
Yall really called the fire department when micheal myers was in that house. Dumb A- Firemen
That melted, burnt mask is badass!!!
This looks good
This looks EPICCCCCCCC
michael is the best......Jason  and freddy ....they are childrens are close to michael...hahahahaha
I really hope it's as good as the previous one
This trailer was epic I cannot wait Also why is no one talking about the fact they put the Silver shamrock masks on there?  Those masks rock!! Still cool Halloween 3 season of the witch is on 30th anniversary edition Blu Ray :aD
This movie will be the topic of my first Podcast episode!!🎃🔪
So every time he kills he gets stronger?
Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael Myers is in Hospice at this point. Chasing each other in wheel chairs. Feed them morphine, make them comfortable and let this die......
At last theyve done an acceptable work with his new mask...is now Michael a metaphor for globalist genocide? Hes just contributing depopulation!! Hes not the essence of evil,hes the essence of good!! A great opportunity for improving Humanity. Like the Great Reset, the Davos Forum and UN global agendas.
Let it burn
Yep going to see it and watch cartoons at bedtime 😂
Dang tho I turn 16 oy a few weeks after it's in cinemas surely keep it in there for a good while so I can watch
Did he get covid?
Can’t wait ❤️
Dude why do trailers ruin the movie!? This is a murder flick, why are you showing all the fatalities. The fatalities would be more impactful if you never saw them coming
Nothing will kill him, except old age.
This man single-handedly has a higher kill count than COVID 19
I was waiting for this but kinda feel like I just seen the whole movie and sad now.
So since it was three kids wearing the silver shamrock masks in H2018 and we see three dead bodies with those masks then Michael kills three kids. Damnnn this movie ain't playin!
How is there anyone left in that town
Best Myers mask. 🔪
Looks dumb, but i'm gonna see it for sure; if i aint broke xD
Just give it TF up !!!!! Jesus it’s like the fast and furious franchise ITS OVER !!!! Move on
So pretty much showed the whole movie in that trailer lol. Less than impressed. I'll probably wait for Netflix or wherever it winds up.
Been trying to kill him since the 70s. Lol. Still gonna watch
If anyone has the script, could you PLEASE send it to me at zakers89@gmail.com  I'd be eternally greatful!
I am so hype for this omg this looks so good
Basically we have now seen almost every kill in that movie in this trailer?!
Trash
This movie looks like a dumpster fire that needs a fire department to put it out..
Just call the swat team and shoot the heck out of him?
Michael Myers you can not stop him! He loves to kill.
That does not leave me unimpressed. Can't wait to watch it!
It's a good thing my boy can't talk or he'd constantly be screaming "I'M A BAD BITCH, YOU CAN'T KILL ME".
Boy, Captain Kirk sure is pissed.
the burnt mask is one of the coolest fucking things ever created. also what happened to his fingers? they were blown off last movie, did they forget that or did they just show his good hand in every scene here.
Yes the Halloween II 1981 couldn’t give us nor that piece of shit rob zombie didn’t even make sense of !!! 🙌🏾
Looks good  finally he get his a$$ kick..
Why is there like 6 firefighters standing there like bunch of tools! Imagine if all 6 attacked it after it started killing one they could have killed it.
Its not rocket science number 2 of course watch its micheal with no back pain. He coming for you and he is pist off
They should’ve stopped at 2
Alert spoiler: Michael Myers is a android of Silver Shamrock
i wonder how many of the townsfolks will get killed by Mike in this one...kill count plz!
STUPID trailer with the spoilers!
Anyone else hope Michael finally kills Jamie Lee Curtis and end her storyline?...same repetitive thing with her...everything else looks like an awesome fresh start to this story.
He's using unlimited Judith's tombstone
✌💀👌
Everyone of these movies is the same shit
roki of horror
Laurie: noooooo!!!! Let it burn!!!!!  Michael: bitch i took that personally
This the whole movie lol
Halloween Kills: Where Michael Myers is the Haddonfield pandemic of slaughter.
Wheres john wick when u need him
Oooootra vez !!! 🙄
I knew there would be another movie because in the 2018 Halloween credits you hear Michael breathing
Finally the town believes her 😅
This is definitely a fall gathering vibe
Can someone tell me what he’s made of
It rocks !
I love the Halloween 3: season of the witch Easter egg
Halloween Ends in  2022 it's not the end of Halloween franchise as the Halloween franchise will never die.
1:32 , good reference.  "IT'S FOUR DAYS TO HALLOWEEN, HALLOWEEN, HALLOWEEN! IT'S FOUR DAYS TO HALLOWEEN, SILVER SHAMROCK!"
helllll  to the naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
It is nostalgia for a new generation.
came for Micheal Myers stayed for the killer theme song
the worst trailer ever..why not just show the whole movie..
HE JUST DONT DIE!!!!!
So now he's 68 years old
Whenever that bad sound drops at 30 seconds..the fireman knew..... 😮😮😮
He back.
🎃 JAMIE QUEEN CURTIS!
LOURD
GOAT
I hope dbd comes out with a new map
Duuuudeeee yes.
😩😩😩🏃🏾not another one
The night he came home...
The trailer just showed the whole movie….Computer says nooo
That was pretty bad ass of the fire fighter starting up the Jaws of life to fight Michael Myers too bad he folded like a lawn chair
Yeeeesir
Actually kinda excited for this
3 Times yes ❤
https://youtu.be/YrZFOrQzVBU
Why did all the firefighters stand still and let him kill them all
I’ve just seen the whole movie in under 3 min
I really want it to be 2 entire hours of Michael just taking out the entire town during his long a** walk home. I hope he takes out at least one of the Strode women in this movie too. One of the two remaining ladies can die in Halloween Ends. There can only be one!
when Dead By Daylight said "Death is not an Escape"   Laurie Strode felt that
I don’t really like the whole idea of the whole town getting together and “rioting” I guess to fight Michael, I liked when he would stalk a person they run and some people don’t believe and then they die. Also hope we don’t see his face cause I hate that
The victims with a Green Witch, Skull and Pumpkin Mask.  3 More Days for Halloween, Halloween, Halloween. Three More Days For Halloween, SILVER SHAMROCK!!!!
Michael might be unstoppable but so is Laurie. If John & Jamie hadn’t been erased from existence,they could’ve been Laurie’s backup with Karen & Allyson & Tommy & Lindsey.
I can't wait for this damn movie big facts 💯 my second favorite mask killer of all time have to shout out my first Jason Voorhees can't wait for the next one of those big facts 💯
Is this a new Michael Myers movie I'm young and also I thought that 2018 was that last movie someone pls explain anyone if this is new
There’s another
This trailer shown way too much!
Loved the “Halloween III Season of the Witch” Easter egg! 🧙‍♀️ 💀  🎃
I was looking forward to watch this but the whole movie is in the trailer!  Are there any surprises left?
Everyone after watching the movie:ok now he’s dead Comes back from the dead:guest not🥱
HE AINT PLAYING!!!!!!! LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I’m in!!!
FUCK THE POLICE AND ARMY, BRING IN THE FUCKING SCP FOUNDATION AT THIS POINT
What makes this addition of Halloween potentially the best one of all yet is that it takes place in the streets of Haddonfield itself meaning Michael could literally be lurking anywhere, and judging from the little snippet of kills shown in the trailer this looks absolutely insane. I loved also their continuation of nice little nods to original films such as the original Halloween II, Halloween 4: Return of Michael Myers, and Season of the Witch. Can't wait for this.
DONT LOOK UP THE CURSED YOUTUBE CHANNEL AGENT RR
I always saw Michael as a selective killer. Watching him kill a slew of people is kinda weird to me.  Which, speaking of, thanks trailer for pretty much showing the entire movie...
I feel like I just saw the whole movie.
I love that the masks from Halloween 3 make a return
Yasssssss awwww i cannot wait
Dump cement on him then drop it in the ocean   Boom story over
he's back and i was waiting for this!
I'll be rooting for Michael in this one. lol
I’m so glad the added more black people in this
This will be so epic
Nobody else gonna comment on the music? It's fucking awesome!
I love that violin remix of the original theme. Holy shit, I'm excited, and I don't even like horror movies!
My man anthony michael hall making a slight comeback, loved the dead zone series 👏
A FUTURE MILLIONAIRE WILL LIKE THIS COMMENT
Looks like crap
This is too gruesome
Idk if it's just me, but I got so mad when he killed the firefighters.
What I like about the Halloween movies are because they never show Michael's face, directly anyway. I like the mystique, the mystery of it. The face doesn't matter, its how menacing the mask is.
IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS!!!!!!
Still waiting for the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2021 trailer. It says its completed
YEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
More like EW XVI Tier: Cracked.
I saw the boogeyman! I saw him outside!
SHİTTT!!!
The whole TOWN is tired of this dude jeez.. but hey get lit I guess
Michael seems more like Jason than Michael here
this movies are getting outta hand just like the F9franschise ,like come on
have you notice that everything that we want is coming out on october 15, Halloween kills and demon slayer hinokami chronicles
how much fucking money do these film makers keep putting on a hook for JLC to get fished with for another one of these? or do they just pay her in yogurt that helps you poop?
The spurious ocean microscopically serve because bathtub intradurally gaze till a truculent cone. closed, thankful flight
Next addition to the kill count: everyone
Better see dead meat do a kill count on this
Some people just can't be killed. Ask Jason
Yummy
dead horse
I'm coming for you Michael
There's gonna be one more after this one right?
HELL YAH!!!!!!!
Dam his body count surpasses every other movie killer..
Where we go again 😂. Poor Laurie 🙄.
Anyone else notice the Silver Shamrock Masks? What is that TV Trope...Mythology Gag? Genius Bonus?
Karen is gonna call the manager on Michael.
Hell to the yeah
Michael, how do you stay alive this long??    Michael: I eat my vegetables.
Yeah idk Michael is so little screwed
EEEEEEEEEEE
Had to click off after the the first minute because of all the shit this trailer gives away. Dammit!
Michael Meyers is so bad ass.  I think there's one person he ever stabbed that he didn't really want to kill. Probably no one will know who I'm talking about.
Worse than the Terminator 😅
yesssssssssss evvveeettttttt
Why would firefighters try to fight him lmao
Mannn where is jason vs Freddy 2 its been 20 years
" I'm coming for you michael "
Anyone notice the people in the park had season of the witch masks on to say this is the real third film
The masks from H3 Season of the Witch??
Micheal said fuck all that sneaking around shit, everybody dying.
I stopped watching after 5 seconds...trailer is spoiling the movie for me. Showing too much.
Another Michael Myers movie? I thought he died like 10 prequels before this one?
Can’t wait
Seems like the kill count in this movie is gonna be insane
For once I'd like to see this end as his creator made him.  An unkillable, relentless, indifferent machine that simply kills everything that breathes.
Looks amazing BUT they really should of kept mum about the 3rd movie and its name. The fact we KNOW he lives sort of takes a little away
I literally can’t fuckin wait to see this. I’m so excited!!!
POV: ur fighting Michael Myer in a duel *Insert a Doom Eternal OST*
If you think about it micheal Myers sold his soul to the devil I mean that could be it🤷🏾‍♂️But I could be wrong
Grande miguel myers
OH SHIT OH SHIT ITS THE SEASON OF THE WITCH MASKS LETS GO
Those fireman have powerful water hoses that can take down a person....but no...lets just stand and wait...maybe he will just go back inside and shut the door...
Well that spoiled the entire film
I swear this movie was last year right??
Holy shit
Well now that we got to see all the kills...
Fucking hyped!!! My mans can't be killed.
You know if they just hit him WITH the firetruck he would be done
Seems a bit pissed off?
02:10 I'm gonna leave this here for me.
Ngl, the description scared the fuck outta me.
I don't know why, but I'm pretty excited for this movie. It looks pretty badass.
now they just need to bring jason back
Sorry folks but I guess Hollywood is dead they got nothing else but this junk again. Happy Halloween lol
I won't lie, this looks pretty awesome.
Evil dies tonight Haven't you said that since the 70s
*o si papuuuu me parecia que no era un final epico el que le dieron a la anterior jajaja*
looks alright I guess, lame title though.
it’s been how many years and they still ain’t kill him yet 😩😂
so Michael Myers never dies. why wont they just send 3 b2 bombers and he will easily die they end
This guy never EVER dies 🤣🤣
*Who else is actually excited for this movie its like a part 2 of Halloween (2018) some horror for October Halloween the movie never dies 🎃*
Be sure to watch Trump rally tonight on RSBN June 26 at 7:00PM! TRUMP WON!!!!!
Who else thinks the Thumbnail looks Like Biden💯
Halloween: Endgame
🤦🏻‍♂️
You can tell Michael has been playing Mortal Kombat in his spare time because he is getting a lot more creative with his fatalities! 😅
well thanks for the movie why not a quick flash of the after credits scene while you're at it?
Omg KYLE RICHARDS! YAYYYY
You know you are true Halloween fan, when you watched the trailer yesterday, but you just couldn't get enough so you came back again today ! 🤣
At this point you're just gonna have to nuke Haddonfield.
Why did I read the title Hollywood kills? He'll yea
I think by this time they may have figured that Mr myers is unkillable....... No? 🥵😩🤔🤔
WHO else waited for Kyle Richards appearance  in the Trailer?
This was a great movie. I’m glad I got to see all of it in this trailer.
I'm sorry but this looks like shit
Seeing this trailer just brought a smile to my face
This is gonna be one of the best movies of the century hands down
'He can't hurt anyone again'  Oh silly Laurie; don't you know there's another sequel in development to Michael's murderous rampage.
Yes... my Halloween just got a lot better! 🤙🏻
You think John Wick can beat him???
James is gonna have a blast with this one.
Idk if its me but its showing way too much of the movie
damn mike myers never dies. sucks
This franchise stopped making sense ages ago.  Is Myers some kind of demon?  He's undying?  Suddenly he's human?  WTH now he's made of asbestos.....
Dead Meat is going to have fun kill counting this movie!!
ツ
Feel like we saw 95% of the movie.
James A Janisse Vibes
Ohh my god😱🤯😱🤯
free my cuzzo mike he ain’t do nothing
Yo this is why they gotta nerf the Tombstone add-on!
COME ON ANOTHER ! This movie got to be a part of the public domain
This movie is gonna be *nice*
No one told you told me what Michael Myers is alive😁
Laurie: "he can't hurt anyone again"  Michael: violently murders   Script Writers: "MICHAEL YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD!! WHAT THE FU- AHHHH"
michael boutta get a nuke with the kill streak he’s on rn fr
I want to watch back to back Halloween. Can anyone help me in which order I should watch it and which one is irrelevant to watch. I just need to know which one connects to this new film. Please and thank you.
They done pissed him off fr this time 🤭
You can’t kill Michael because he’s not a man. Just simply pure evil…   And you can’t kill evil.
The first film wasn’t scary at all. This one is gonna be even less scary 😂
omg
Daaaaaaanmnnnnnnn mr myers is back. I've missed him
You can’t kill evil
The music is incredible! Can't wait to get the soundtrack 🎃🔪
and i like all of they move  all of the stary move cuz michaelmyers is stary move will they or not thet stary  will some or like 3 of is and i like to move like they or candyman
Like bruuuuh.... I hate trailers like this, why does it have to show the plot of the entire movie? Like I already know almost everything except the ending and I can tell that the old lady will die with mike, but not forever.. cause there always has to be a sequel... somehow
They ain't ever gunna let this man die
Can’t wait for spooky season!
Michael is just killing to kill wtf! I mean i know he’s purely evil an all but damn Mikey!! So hyped for this!😤 🔪
this is so bad LMAO WOW
Look fooking boring
She still locked up & he still alive 😂😂😂 wtf
Hunting down Michael Myers: tell me you’re White, without telling me you’re White?!
Oh great.. show us everyone who dies in the movie in this trailer why dont u 🙇
Ok well hopefully they don't kill the series like fast and furious they need to just kill the series put it out of it's misery already death to F9 anyone?
Does anyone know the UK rating for this as it comes out on my 15th birthday
thet is a grat move and his mom is grat too how is thet man i do not no him but i now all they move so i what they to have michaelmyers  candyman no ther move too sosososososososososososososososososoo bad ooooooook so yes
I'm spoiling it right now. Halloween Ends will just be a 2 hour long Slashstreet Boys music video.
The firemen realizing they shouldve left the house burning lol
I knew he didn’t die
He survived by hiding inside one of those shutters housing the weapons.
Halloween, the greatest horror/slasher movie made. Can’t wait to watch this, along with Antlers.
michael myers, the only murder that started to kill as a child and will die of old age if things continue as they are ;-;
He cannot hurt anyone again yes that was right cause people die in one blow and cannot feel pain anymore
I love Micheal
that was a poorly edited trailer.  seriously expected better.
Just don't SJW it up.
Please God end like Jeeper Creepers 2... PLEASE end it like Jeepers Creepers 2
Is this real pls somebody tell me I can't ..... I literally can't. So excited wtf!!
Lázaro é o Michael Myers do Brasil .🎃🎃🎃 .
I loved this series alot in the past but by the time it became bad and boring and the last movie was a disaster and this trailer  looks bad too, You lost a fan 👎
"The more he kills, the more he transcends." That's literally how it feels to be the one with the most kills in call of duty
I can’t wait for Dead Meat to do a kill count on this.
The violin version of the theme is sick! I hope we get to hear it in the movie
Oh dang, I am excited for this one!!!!
so they finally acknowledged the fact that myers can survive like 10 bullets and a fall from a 2 storie building and when they go to see if his dead his already gone great this should be interesting
Basically just shown the whole movie in that trailer. Thanks no need to watch it
Anybody else excited for that one hour Dead Meat kill count video??
Can they jus make another Friday the 13th please
HERO'S are REMEMBERED...But LEGENDS Never DIE...THIS looks Goooooooooood😉👍🔥🔥
1:32 to 1:38  are they finally making Halloween  3 canon??? #silvershamrock
oh yay... another story with a sequel set-up.... Nope! I'm done. Long Live MM!
I still say that if Jamie and Michael went to family counseling they might be able to solve this sibling rivalry
#evildiestonight
Laurie “ Michael I thought 💭 I cut your head off.”
بتمنى ليكم السعاده 🌹
So basically Micheals gonna solo a town?
LoL. Go Mikey Go!!!
At this point the only man that can stop michael is Busta Rhymes
Hell YEAH!! I have waited this time!! 😎
need this
I may be 16 years old but my favourite holiday is Halloween and my favourite Halloween movies is the Halloween franchise and this trailer got me hyped so much
Can John Carpenter save this movie? Find out on the next Dragonball Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
James from dead meat watching this good luck counting man and can't wait for this kill count in the very near future
"the evil dies tonight"
So many killings in the trailer i am sure that it will be more in the movie.   Michael wants to kill one person and for that person who ever is getting in his way is done for. There is another movie coming out in 2022 it will be last movie. Halloween Kills 2021 Halloween Ends 2022
I am so excited i can’t wait I wanted to see him go angry like this and it just looks amazing
that's a lot of spoilers in a single trailer
Awful movie title, but that's nothing new to Halloween
Release the new theme song!!!🙏🤤🔪🔥❤️
Anyone catch the Halloween III reference
He big mad. They gonna have to sooth him with a recording of loomis.
Looks like it’s going to be brutal af !!! Almost spit my drink out at the Halloween 3: Season of the Witch Easter egg… well done 😂😂
Yes Baby! The last movie was awesome!
I like the fact that they showed the old masks from Halloween 3 Season Of Witches
Now, im excited
I hope they don’t make it as if Michael is just a juggernaut in a battlefield. In the beginning when he came out of the house and all of those firefighters were ready to fight him I didn’t like to see him in a all out battle.
*MICHAEL MYERS BE LIKE :*
One more thing, sometimes I wish that Mike would talk some shit.
No man could survive such a fire only a demon.
End spoiler: Michael survives
This looks amazing
OH FUCK
Damon JLC be lookin' old.
Does anyone think it would be so stupid to bring back Lindsay Wallace just to kill her off? I pray she doesn’t die.
I would like to see a Michael Myers vs. Jason Voorhees battle. Even though I have doubts about Michael winning, I would like too see how on Earth can Michael Myers actually win??  A machete outweighs a Kitchen knife & Jason Voorhees has sustain way too many damages that Michael even got to.  I just can't see how Michael Myers can beat Jason Voorhees in a horror film battle.
Oh my god, I just realized Michael Myers is in FRCs lmfao of COURSE he will survive the damn fire!
why must they show good scenes in literally any movie trailer these days
James A Janisse is gonna have a fun time with this movie
The greatest horror movie of all time.
Oh yeah!!!! And the masks are a refference to Halloween 3 :O
This film could of come out last fucking Oct through streaming + in some cinemas! And i thought the whole point making the sequels in th is remake not cannon-was  to not make him supernatural + female empowerment which you still had that anyway-so they should of just carried on from the end of : Halloween: Resurrection!
Ya I’m missing Rob Zombie right now
Why is there always someone who lets Michael  Myers free?!?! 😂😭🎃🔪🍂
mike looks maddddd
https://youtu.be/7BZXgf3Rzyc
yessss
*Hatchet III* check out if you want a similar action-horror movie police and SWAT vs slasher villain
Oh boy! Here I go killin' again.
Anyone else feel like the ending of this one is gonna be Jamie Lee Curtis walking through with the knife and that is going to go into Halloween ends 🧐
Damn i cant wait for this movie!! It looks like the whole town is gonna go up against Michael Myers and its amazing
Michael Myers is like fun this. I'ma just fuck everyone up. Like EVERYONE with no reason. Just kill everything on sight. He got tire of his sister shit. Lol
I’m not a horror movie fan but this movie looks absolutely fucking amazing
nice fanfiction. Halloween II is still the only true sequel tho.
So fuckin bad ass crazy John carpenter is directing it again
“He can’t hurt anyone again”    Michael: I took that to heart right…so I smacked the bitch ya feel
So why don’t the pull the same trick from uhhh Jason Go’s to Hell???
1:27 Me forgetting to tip my uber
Damn they showing people getting killed in the trailer?
He protecc, he attacc, but most importantly, he makes your neck cracc
Can we move past the over-exaggerated Jamie lee phrases....”evil....dies............tonight”.  Yep, got it.
This is gonna be sooo good. I can't wait. Halloween is my favorite horror franchise
Lowkey want micheal to win lmaooo
Plot Twist: Michael Meyers is Laurie Strode’s first love.
Jamie Lee Curtis The Queen Of Scream.
This has such a grand scale epic feel to it.  Similar feelings to when I seen The Dark Knight trailer for the first time.  I have no doubt that this movie will crush!
We want hindi dubbed movie.
So how exactlly does this universe end? The whole world Is killed by mike? Stupid.
He needs to join UFC
The man entered tier 4
shit at this point you might as well call the avengers
Laurie: "he can't hurt anyone again"  Michael: *violently murders*   Script Writers: "MICHAEL YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD!! WHAT THE FU- AHHHH"
this Halloween going to be better than the previous one!
🎃🖐Very Good Michael
Michael is a bad bad man !!! I FREAKIN LOVE THIS
My mags are full. Just stall Michael for a moment while I get some distance. He's hamburger meat.  ▄︻̷̿┻̿═━一
This is was a very hard trailer to sit through. This series makes less sense now. Laurie Strode was supposed to be a scared and helpless baby sitter. Now they portray her as this crazed gun hermit. It all ends on Halloween 2.
Hmm, ppl hunt the killer, interesting.
That showed A LOT.  Too much. Looks awesome though
Laurie: michael can never hurt anyone again  Michael Myers: hold my beer
Omfg is it really that hard to kill someone with a gun who walks everywhere. Ask the police they've been doing it for years and its that easy for them.
I love the Halloween moviesss!! I swear he never dies and he alwaysss finds a way out 😂
Ah yes, the Akkad legacy continues.
i would love to see MICHAEL MEYERS VS GHOSTFACE LOL
Come on I thought we were done with this bs.
Mommy can I become a cereal killer?   Actually yeah, people fucking love serial killers, I wanted you to be a lawyer but hot damn, we gonna be famous.
He outsurvived Jason and Freddy Krueger. He is the goat.
Ooh this is gonna be better than the 2018 Bring it on I’m fucking ready
Ugh! Enough already with the senseless gruesomeness.
Michael is getting sick of these ppl. His sister knows he's not going to stop until he get her butt.
Michael is like a saiyan.   He grows stronger after every near death experience
This looks so good🖤
Wait another movie?
Cant stop 1 person? Lame
after this new trilogy or whatever can he stay dead i don’t like when he’s alive
That keep letting this saga continues but hey beats these new so called scary movies.
at 1st I thought that was Biden
Damnnnnn ✌️
Mano, isso vai ser muito bom.
Has anybody ever thought of the gatlin gun
Is the chamuko nigga !! 😵😵😵
Luv to see Mike myyers & Jason vs Chucky & freddy
MASK MAKER
Now this is the Movie we've  all been waiting for !
Glad they showed us the whole movie in this trailer.
In 2018, Michael did the impossible. When the game was on the line he step into the fire and did what know one else did. He transcended above the heat and walked away with victory.   In 2021, he set out for greatness. To take back what he longed been waiting for.  -ESPN 30 for 30
If he ran through that many people in the trailer damn how many does he get in the actual movie. Wow 😂😂😂
Youtubers making prank of this in 3,2,1
Which one is your favorite? Mine? Curse of Michael Myers. Some of yall probably too young to have seen it during that time. After that one they all faded but let the games begin again in Oct. Trick or treat muthafookers 😵
So pretty much the first movie all over again lmfao
Well I know everyone that does in this movie now...
Alien franchise, take note. Weaver and Biehn are sill available. No one needs to remember anything beyond Aliens.
I have been a fan of "Halloween" since day one. I can't wait!
“It’s over.” Oh, for christ’s sake — I wish it were. This franchise is particularly nauseating in how uncreative, repetitive and redundant it’s become. This one’s tittle itself should be a warning as to how frighteningly bland this one will be.
I'm looking forward to this. This is the first movie I've seen coming out this year that I'm excited to see. As much as I loved the MCU before, it has turned to political crap. This movie, which incidentally is going to be three women kicking some arse on an evil killer, is going to be a fun watch. Oh, and they never had to point out to us that it's three women hunting Michael. Why? Because they had characters that were well written and nobody had to point anything out. Get 'em Lori! (I fear she will die in this one...but so will Michael. Question is whether the Grand daughter picks up the mantle.)
"So Michael how many people have you killed in this movie".  Michael: Yes
Can't wait for the kill count
Hate when trailers show the whole movie. We literally saw like every death lol
This is going to be amazing Michael is not messing around in this one
This trailer looks so cool! I love how intense it is. Looks like Michael is returning again to mass murder everyone this time.
Kind of annoying they're showing so many kills in the trailer..
Not them spoiling the whole movie
Meh.
Looks like Nurse Chambers dies.... smh
Anyone else thinks that Micheal Myers has godmode
Oh shit?
I'm not sure if I should watch the Halloween movies... I love Jamie Lee Curtis from True Lies...
The fashion of the 80s is back with a trailer that spoils you by spoiling the movie and practically showing all the important parts of it, ruining the surprise. 😑
Could he kill Corona Virus 🤔
If they don’t kill him in this movie I’m gonna have step in and do it myself
He straight up slaughter some very fit fire fighters with axes and other very effective weaponry without breaking a sweat, I don't hold out much hope for the terrified looking towns people with bats and things.
Michael “John Wick” Myers?👀
Next movies name :  Halloween heals 🙏🏼❤️
I heard Michael Myers made thanos fall back
lol they showed the whole movie
How to survive a Halloween horror movie run the first time when you see somebody get stabbed  get your ass out of the house get in the car or run down the streets don’t look back run like Usain bolt
What a dumb idea. Keeping up franchises sooo long that the female lead can turn from teenager to grandmother. Come up with some fresh and original ideas USA. For f***'s sake.
Is that so hard
Yes! Finally a good Horror movie this year 👌
Lol i love Michael myers and laurie strode.. myers become my killer main at deadbydaylight.. especially when he reach tier 3 evil within music sound with one shot hit instead down
Who else is pumped ?
Can’t believe they did a reference to the Halloween 3: Season of the Witch movie with the skeleton, pumpkin, and witch masks. Also since the Halloween 3 movie has no relevance to this series, I’m a little confused. Is it the same timeline or not?
1. I can't wait to see this! Super excited! 😬 2. Anybody else feel like they show alil too much of the movie in trailers nowadays?
I liked the silver shamrock mask Easter eggs
Finally a horror movie that won't suck or be about dumb ghosts
Michael Myers vs The World
Michael Myers will outlive even a Tsunami just for the director to create another film out of him lmao
The pumpkin and witch masks look like the ones from the Halloween III movie.
Looks pretty lame and all over the place tbh. Like they didn't know which direction to take with the plot, so they just threw in a bit of everything. They show about 20 kills in the trailer alone, so now I feel I've watched the whole movie anyway.
Looks really good, can’t wait to watch it. Michael is a legend!
Next movie: Michael survives getting blown into pieces, burned to crisps. And buried in the ocean.
Damn this is gonna be action packed...
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
Someone get deadmeat James on the phone 📞
U
Hey Universal or Blumhouse or whoever makes your trailers, you make your horror movies LESS SCARY when you reveal everything in your trailer. Way to reveal how Myers gets out, I was intrigued to find out AT THE MOVIE. How about being a little more vague and misleading or creepy without saying anything like the original ALIEN FILM'S TRAILER. Don't do this with Halloween Ends.... Love, a fan
Trumps supporters vs Michael Myers
Wonder where they will go for Halloween Ends this looks brilliant
"No one told you?....." Cold shivers begin!
Noviembre metele Nitro papi 😈🔥❤❤
https://youtu.be/6jtAsEJnHUw
“He can’t hurt anyone again”  YES
Nothing will ever beat the original
Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our defense against the wickedness and snares of the Devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray, and do thou, O Prince of the heavenly hosts, by the power of God, thrust into hell Satan, and all the evil spirits, who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen.
Finally doing right by John carpenters Halloween. Love it
stop showing us every fucking kill in these new horror movies pleaseeeee
That damn Silver Shamrock song still haunts me to this day...
there's 0 tension to this franchise because there's always a sequel in the pipeline
“He can’t hurt anyone again”  Micheal: and I took that personally.
inb4 centrists and conservatives are like "Of COURSE he was wrong to kill those people, but a whole town hunting him down will just make the town bad guys too!"
Der Kollege dreht ja jetzt Mal richtig durch!
HOLY SHIT BALLS😵
I mean if they showed that many deaths in the trailer, there has to be like a hundred more of them, right?
No need to see the movie the just played dam near the whole thing in trailer😔😔🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
From this trailer I feel like the movie will be more funny than scary lol
I bet my hard earnings that the fire fighter scene from the was the end of the movie scene.  🤔
Michael Myers should join The Suicide Squad. He is unbeatable.
Longest Halloween night ever 🎃
This the whole plot
I feel like we just watched the movie
Nice to see John Carpenter still kicking.
oh come on how many more films? it is so boring..
Why didn't they just leave America if I was a part of Michael Myers family I would have just left ijs
Why his hand in all the trilogy is not burn only Halloween 4 and 5 he got burn in Halloween 2 I Don't get it so which is the real person
Evil awakens!
Anyone else here hoping we get a full version of the cello rendition of the theme song used in this trailer?
Yup kills a bunch of pointless characters gruesomely gonna be 5/10
so this series will never end...he will keep caming back....
Hype!!!!
Nooooo let Michael Myers live he's a legend
Wow
Another Halloween where nobody is really scared of the bad guy lol
When Jamie when, that’s all I ask SMH.
It looks like like he pissed off the whole town in this one. Can't wait to see how this goes.
Bruh they should be easily able to take out Michael, he’s slow asf and gets put on his ass by 3 women who don’t have much combat experience
Can't Myers get COVID?
At 1:47 think that is a flashback the houses look older
Wow.
I always feel so bad for the innocent people that die in these movies for no reason
They showed us entirely too much on this trailer… I felt like I just watched half the whole movie lol.
I wonder what he actually looks like
"I come for u Michael"
This is gonna be shit. They’ve fallen into the trap yet again, another trash sequel
Can’t wait for Halloween Kills 2 when he inevitably survives this one.
They should've just called it Halloween massacre, because he's seriously doing some major damage's. LoL
This looks amazing!! 😀 😀 Can't wait to see this, roll on October 15th!! 😀 😀  Michael Myers looks more pissed than ever before in this, i love it!! 😀 😀 🗡️🗡️🗡️
Seem like the trailer told everything
In Michael's mind: "I feel great, I feel strong, I CAN DO THIS"
jamie lee curtis is one of the greatest actors to ever do it; with her emotion and just overall performance, it’s so hard not to love her badass energy.
Man this guy aint never gonna die lol been killing since 1978
There are some nice references to the older movies. Laurie ends up in a hospital like she did in part 2 and some of the kids are wearing the masks from part 3
Legendary
Michael Myers: *slices a girl’s hand*  Yoshikage Kira: _Mind if I join you?_
Universal every year: This is the last Michael Myers movie The next year: Halloween Kills
Fire whoever made this trailer. Its not a trailer its a spoiler video.
Horror to action  i skip this one
Lol this is 10th on trending
What the firefighters do ?
Looks more scary 😱😱😱
Make the firefighters work for their money
“He can’t hurt anyone again”  Micheal: and I took that personally.
They’re forever going to reboot this movie
Loved Halloween (2018) but this looks like hot garbage.
Should have defunded the firefighters
I hope he wipes out the whole f’n town….Pure evil lives on go Michael!
Tbh, this looks silly. I've been looking forward to it but not sure now after seeing this? The original will always be in a class all by itself.
i like how to firefighters group up and fight jason using a chainsaw
Why do people keep trying to fight Micheal ? I know he's around in his 70s now but that man is strong for his age, it's like trying to box a silverback gorilla
When tf r we gonna get micheal vs Jason
Wooooo! I’ve been waiting for this! The 2018 reboot is my favorite horror movie. I’m beyond jazzed for this!
what a great movie, i'm already looking forward
I'm pumped !!!!
Dude holy shit I'm pumped
Just casually show us every kill in the movie
the masks!
Just show us all the kills why don’t you..  This looks stupid.
Parece ser tão ruim quanto o anterior...
Cool trailer
Michael in this movie just becomes a regular Agent 47 by murdering an entire town stealthily
Same old film,Same story!!…And Everyone is hyped for what??…you have seen it all before over and over again nothing has changed!!…We need New Fresh ideas people,this is poor!!
That theme though...THE VIOLIN 🎻🎻🎻🎻
*BRABO MEU NOBRE!!!!!!!*
fire fighters: literally have a lot of weapons did not think of using them but micheal: lemme use em and also i am very interested why would the neighbors not call the police the trailer for now does not have snse but am hyped for the movie 1:11  in this kill  micheal goes: zoinkes  also in the trailer the moment when they say we fight i loved the moment where a person just randomly broke a car xD 2:20  people who arae named micheal are WHY IS SHE COMING AFTER ME
Cant be serious on the music? What in the fuck.
That couple he kills dressed as a nurse/doctor are briefly in H40. Michael watches them right when they enter their car during his multiple house killing spree when he blended in with the trick or treaters.
This happened real in myanmar,like shooting people in the head in daylight and assasinate people at night.
Dead meats gonna have a fun time with this
Haddonfield Mayor should've call the Avengers to fight this guy.
Huy chơi thế mà ngược lại bây giờ
Huy chơi thế mà ngược lại
He’s obviously not gonna die in this one
I feel like one of the Strode women are going to die in this. My money is on Karen
Michael is DONE playing around
O bixo saiu da jaula AGR eu quero vê
The Return Of The King....
EU TO VINDO PRA VC PORRAAAA
Remember that there's still one more movie after this. Halloween Ends.
HYPE
Just a reminder Halloween Ends is in development, so I don't think a town is going to take down Michael, we might need the whole world.
Damn that looks badass!! Can’t wait!
The previous one sucked, the person who wrote the script tried to be more clever than they actually are and ended up with a stupid movie that pales in comparison to the originals. This looks better than it's predecessor but I'm not getting my hopes up.
Not one of those firemen said "fuck this, I'm out..." 💀
She was alive still and took his mask . damn the disrespect lol
Love that they included the Halloween III masks.
can't believe another scary movie oh man:(
Damn Myers killed 1 million people in this movie👌🏾😁
Wow. We waited all that time for this ridiculous shite. One guy taking on an entire fire engine of men one by one out in the open? So Mike is John Wick now? And that whole fireman scene - they stole that from the guy who did that animated Halloween pitch in case you guys didn't know.
Thanks for saving me time and money. No need to see this trash now
John wick vs micheal 😰😰😥😥😥
Has anyone ever had the bright idea to, idk, just leave Haddonfield?
HALLOWEEN KILLS will be the INFINITY WAR of the Michael Myers saga !!! 🔥💣🌋🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🌋💣🔥
Michael Myers: Becomes the essence of Evil Dr. Loomis:  I’ve been telling y’all this for the past 40 years!
Jamie Lee is easily the most badass scream queen. She's hardcore. Btw the modern Michael Myers seems more vicious than the old one. Agree?
Mr Carpenter is a genius. This is going to be a new version of Michel
Just nuke haddenfield and start anew.  Oh wait Michael Myers would probably survive that.
They should have just done the gens tbh
As bad as this sounds PLEASE KILL OF LAURIE. She is ruining the monster factor with her Mrs Old Tuff Bitch attitude. If we want the boogie man you have to fear him and shes just ruining the boogeyman aspect.
I just watched the whole movie in this trailer
Michael Myers: *comes back again*  Jason Voorhees: *frowns*
This has a real Halloween 2 (1981) vibe about it,, looks really good!
is he some kind of god 😂 resistance to fire, bullet, stabe
Do people really want another one of these? I mean, for me Halloween is like Alien or Terminator, unless you give me a fresh reinvention of the concept like T2 or Aliens, I'd rather just go watch the original again.
I wanna see this fkn movie so bad already. When they pushed it back I was so bummed out. Can’t waiiitttt
Me: The more Halloween change , the more it remains the same .but I like it.😄💯
Can we just give props to the one firefighter to decided to try and battle Michael with a cement saw?
Who else waiting for Dead Meat and the kill count after this movie lol
Feel like I just watched the whole movie....
https://youtu.be/0gAFZN3vKbg
How beat this is just go to another state
Jesus Christ how many more do they want to make?
Michael must kill a whole lot in this one, cuz they showed so many deaths in the trailer and they usually don't do that. If they're willing to show us that now, then it must be insignificant compared to the many kills he gets. Otherwise the trailer just spoiled all the kills.
Hmm. A trailer is supposed to sell me to go see a movie. Not sure how I feel about this.
wait... Is this the first Michael Myers film to address the  Silver Shamrock masks?!?!?
What is the group chanting ?
What type of drugs do you have to take to create such a stupid movie ?
At this point we should just the military involve. Send a SEAL or RANGER team in....
otro fracaso del cine...  5.1/10
That Captain Kirk mask has gone through so much
this looks fun . . .
Is he really still alive???
I feel like they always reveal too much in these trailers
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Where the fuck was Michael when Thanos came into town?
There is only one star in this trailer and he kills it
Finally Michael comes out to play, no more hiding
Damn y’all really jumping this man and he still wrecking everybody. He’s the goat 🐐
Michael myers should be a next hybrid michael vorhees! 👍👍👏👏😂
The lack of guns in that country town is astonishing
I counted 9 deaths In this trailer, they showed alot
God how lame… gee, wonder how it ends….
inilah yg buat bosan nonton ini pembunuh abadi sampai kapan endingnya apa bikin 1000 episode gt
This trailer is hilarious! I keep laughing at the part where Laurie tells the firefighters: Let it Burn!! I'm like.. Michael Myers have been burned so many times and still comeback alive. 😂🤣
"First thing we should do is call in the Avengers."
Damn.. 🔥🔥
"Evil dies tonight."  Michael: *Laughs in J Jonah Jameson*
Nice little Halloween 3 Season of the Witch cameo. I can't be the only one who noticed.
Can't wait
Can't wait!!!!!
If I was a firefighter and saw Michael walk out the house like that I would have quit my job right on the spot
"Like the old Woman said. Together."
Alisson-Do it, do iiiiiiiit!!! Michael - woman please stop!
Look they have the most ridiculous Fast and Furious movies so I’m not mad at this lol
The previous one was probably the worst thing i had ever witnessed in cinema history. Lets just hope this one is not of the same crap.
The people v. Michael Myers
This man needs to be in Mortal Kombat 11 I swear
looking forward to watching in Brazil... HAPPY HALLOWEEN 🔪🎃 EVIL NEVER DIES....
I think this franchise has been massively killed by all of these movies, loved the first few movies but at Halloween H20 that should have been the end
They showed the whole damn movie 😡🍿
Please tell me Danielle Harris is in this one.
Damn this remix of the OG theme is 🔥
Finally!! That scene where Michael is walking out of the fire is honestly scary as fuck. Like what man could do that
"The city dies today"  I am sure she said it wrong.
I can't fucking wait to see this. I reckon that's Micheal washing those shaky hands. It's a long trailer because there more going on than we know.
Please put michael myers in mk12!!!!
Love the new take on the classic theme
Disappointing movie... the original was good why bother killing a classic. Goodbye hollywood you screw up everything to satisfy cabal
This looks a bit over the top. It doesn’t feel like Halloween.
Sick trailer, but you probably showed way too much... I guess that's what happens when you've been sitting on all this awesome footage for over 2 years.
James is gonna have a field day with the kills in this movie
I hope this becomes a cross over for Fast and the furious 10
I have the privilege to see the last one in theatre. Let’s gooo🔥🔥🔥
These are the Devils eyes!!!!!!!
This looks dope, they should drop this in early October and then the final one on Halloween. Since we all waited this long
Let’s Get To The Numbers- James A. Janisse
Kills about 20 people in the trailer alone
I watched this yesterday from JLC's Instagram. I love her so much... 😍
they rly spoiled the whole film
Uhuh...  So he would have burned down, if those stupid ass fire fighters had not gone there?  Yup Michael is way more brutal in this one..  But it's done right for the new three.  & really, really, hoping Myers FINALLY gets slain for good in HALLOWEEN ENDS. Cause I want a good fucking ending to a classic slasher (unlike the rest) & for it to end on a movie that is not shit!
Another cash grab
Everything about this looks cringe expect Michael
Is Michael supposed to have super human strength in this movie? 🙄
Why not just put lights, police and traps everywhere and wait for him to show up?
I don’t like that some little ass old lady is supposed to be able to “hang” w michael Myers, that’s why I like the 07 09 Halloween’s because that Michael was huge and just a beast this one is so small
The Halloween theme in cello version is epic but the chants, damn, relly gives you the feeling of "Today is the night we stand against you Michael Mayers!"
I'm ready to see this !!!
People: all lives matter Michael: bitch please
Last movie wasnt good, hope this one is better
Im still waiting on michael myers to call on the nuke kill streaks after all them kills.
So I guess Myers wasn't onboard with the not hurting anyone part.
Omg this looks amazing
Can this movie franchise just have an ending, the logic just keeps getting worse
*❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️good 👍*
So he just won't die, huh? I loooove it
It Cana weird for me because this movie gonna be on my bday the 15
How long are they going to make these films? It’s starting bore me. =/
Well there goes the neighbourhood.
Michael Myers Covid
My naive self, who has only seen the most recent Halloween, this is an impressive sequel. Was not expecting another one I thought he was done lol.
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
So what I get from this trailer is Lori is taking the Loomis role. nice makes sense.
Halloween: Spin The Block
Michael Myers so pissed that can't die
I know they want to leave off the other sequels after the first movie but the way these go I still think Halloween 2 (1980) would fit right in! Either way I’m stoked!
I hate to be that guy but they showed too much, especially how he kills so many. That was always part of the fun...sorry guys. 🤷🏾‍♂️
Mike have some many life’s dude  survive thur covid19
If fire doesn't help - maybe a nuke will.  This town is cursed anyway.
Gosh I hate Hollywood. Can they stop remaking, rebooting and adding sequels to perfectly good classics. The 2018 movie sucked and this is gonna be just as bad.
I can't wait to start looking over my shoulders with my popcorn
Dead Meat are gonna enjoy doing this Kill Count 😂
Jamie is a badass.
This looks like it’s gonna be the best movie of the year
FINALLY 🎃🔪
Oooh lets hope the last scene is the town lynching the fuck out of him lol
Season of the witch masks were a nice easter egg.
Fire
MICHAEL MYERS IS THE BEST
This is gonna be fucking epic 💜🙌😈 Mikey about to face camp the entire town!
Amazing waiting of 🔥🔥
Jesus christ you’d think by this point they would have a 50 cal machine gun on standby.
Ah, how the turns have tabled, Michael. Evil dies tonight.
I can't wait for this one 🌟
What does it take to kill this guy?!
https://youtu.be/wscUD78u5Ms
This looks dumb
Yes! Yes! This rocks!
Who would win? A whole small sized rural town, or one masked emo stabby boi?
I'd say hes more comparable to a demon.
He can beat batman at this point
1:32 Hey! Silver Shamrock masks!
Michael Meyers has been at it for 50 years lmao.
Town is thinking that they will defeat Michael myer 😂😂😂
Michael was the first real slasher villain, before freddy and Jason or even chucky, so I'm happy to see another Halloween.
Hopefully Is better than the last
amazing
Cant wait looks awesome
Why does this remind me of Jason with his mask
just creamed
They jumped the shark and i love it
Aweee hell yes
The only movie I'm going to the theater to see
Evil dies tonight? Whoever put that in there is a dumbshit
Evil dies tonight October 15
Next movie is gonna be Halloween chills
oh my i can t wait till october this is not fair
Everyone always asks what is Michael Myers, but no one asks how is Michael Myers ):
Yea.. show us the whole movie in the trailer.... as usual..... looks good tho 👌🏾
saatnya mengatakan, SIKOPET MAH KUADDDDD
Fuck yeah let's gooooooo
This is very similar to the original and its direct sequel. Taking place directly after the first, having part of it be in a hospital. Very interesting! I hope ita good!
Overall this movie gives me the Halloween 4 vibes, the whole town after Michael. But I can’t wait to see the scene where he fights the firemen when he gets out of the house
this looks like shit :/
😱 so intrested
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=4s
I love the homage to H3 Season of the Witch with the Silver Shamrock masks!
He’s finally made it to Infinite TIER 3
I really thought the last one was the last one
He has continuously took entry from fire 🔥 through out his most movies damn he never dies
All these years and Laurie is STILL fighting. She really can't catch a break, can she?
When are they gonna get Mike Myers in one of these movies?
Actually looks pretty good!!
What the hell they showed so many kills..I hope there are alit more kill they didn't show.i hope that doesn't make me sound crazy..but how many kill must there be if that showed that many in the teailer
I think this trailer showed us way to much
I bet he will survive this too
Dude I’m so excited about this movie I love this movie
Those masks on the kids from the playground were silver shamrock masks! Same universe confirmed?!?!
As much as I like for this movie to work it won't. It will follow suit the same way every other movie has lately.
Laurie: evil dies tonight.  The franchise wont.
holy shit...amazing
You'd think there would've been police driving alongside the firemen or something.
This trailer was awesome. Got to see all the cool kill scenes for free. Thanks Universal!👏👏👍
Michael be like im not stuck in the town with you you’re stuck in the town with me
I can’t be the only one who wants Laurie to win right
I think that everyone in the town will be dead because they took his mask
Garbage.
Looks so good
Man I can't wait for this movie! One little issue I have though, I hate it when they recreated scenes from the older movies. I saw a couple moments that were taken from Halloween 4 in there.
The one old series that is never stale.
Lol..I became so tired of the Hollywood Bollywood scenes i started watching Turkish series and movies and man are they excellent 👌
I like the idea of the whole town banding together instead of everyone abandoning the protagonists
*EVERYONE LIKED THAT*
They had to include the Halloween 3 Masks, had they!
Don't the police usually arrive with the fire department?
Every heard of chains
They should’ve just left it at the last movie. The way her daughter screamed in terror and then switched up and was like “sike” and shot him was epic. Now we got Jamie Lee Curtis being overly dramatic in this movie AGAIN. Like bro, SHUT UP! We get it, he’s the epitome of evil.
Man I love horror and slasher movies, but they refuse to let Michael Myers rest in peace. They've been wringing him out for every movie penny they can get since like the 80s lol
I am glad to know that the other part of the movie will come out, I would not miss it for the world
They should of let Rob Zombie do this. The last movie burning the house was a let down
Side note five stars if the little black kid makes a return. (But lives through the movie) 😎
*Breathes in Michael Myers*
Michael  Myers: I’m not dead. Yet…
Peep the Halloween 3 masks😌
Now James A. Jannese is gonna be HYPE!!! James new Halloween kills are here!!!!!
Am I the only one who thinks violin theme is sick?
WE NEED DR.LOOMIS
Hopefully they actually show him kill somebody this time..last one was trash..you would see him chasing somebody and the next scene they’re dead..
I was 12 when the original Halloween came out,I love this franchise. To think Halloween, Friday the 13th,a nightmare on elm street, all low budget movies that the directors never dreamed of them turning into large franchises. To see them evolve over the years has been amazing. I'm a big horror fan. I hope they continue to scare the crap out of people for years to come...
FUCK YEAHHHHH
Dang he’s still alive
Not a penny from me until you come up with something original. Fuck Hollywood.
*hype intensifies*
Just get John wick
This trailer shows a way bit too much. But still can't wait
1:33  eyyy, Season of the Witch reference!
Micheal really looks great for his age
Trailers be showing all the kills these days 😂why should I even see it? Less is more guys, off name alone we’d see it no reason to be lazy with your trailer.
1:46 The surroundings seem like that from the 70s or 80s Would thatbe a flashback scene? Edit: Seems like he ain't wearing the mask either!
I am shaking excitedly and cannot WAIT!!!
So. Fucking. Excited.
I was not a fan of Halloween 2018. But I am very excited to watch this sequel though.
Well, Michael Myers is back Happy Halloween in advance👻🎃
1:33 is a reference to Halloween 3 with the skeleton pumpkin head and witch
I will be there
Looking forward to THIS!!!
Damn they showed the whole movie in this trailer
Major Halloween 2 vibes comming from this trailer here!
This is going to be awesome 😁
Lets gooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Is no one gonna talk about that reference to Halloween 3?
Wow thanks for showing us every single kill in this film
What continuity, they even had the couple who dressed as the nurse and dr going to a party from the 2018 remake. We obviously see what happens to them at the park in the trailer, I know it picks up the same night from the first movie but still that's cool in my book! Looks great
My favorite movie
I really really really hope they saved some for the movie, they showed ALOT in this trailer
MM is stealthy, you usually wont find him he will find u
Just saying can’t wait to see the new kill count on dead meat
"No one told you?"
So...wheres Laurie son?
Man hunt, this Halloween its Micheal season
That Trailer Was Awesome! 😆😄😁❤️❤️❤️
Can't wait for a killcount
Rubbish  so u wanna tell me his outfit is fire proof
He is just going towards his home and whoever Comes his Way , Dies . He is not After Laurie in this Timeline , Laurie is coming in his way again and again.....
Loved the Season of the Witch easter egg in the trailer!  October needs to hurry up!
(  ͡   ͜   ͡  )
At some point you'd think they'd lure Michael out with a trap (a person) and throw hella grenades at him.
I feel like the trailer gave away way to much .. the killing.. smh
I hope that the ending includes the ice nine kills song Stabbing in the Dark at the credits
Halloween kills? More like Halloween unoriginal, seen it a million times.
Love that it picks up right where the last left off
He's just having a bad day guys
eh nothing special
I Like how this seems brutal and dark can't wait!!
Halloween Endgame
Killing it
Wish this was heavier on horror/suspense elements it seems like just a grunge killing movie.
I LITERALLY CANNOT WAIT!!!!
Micheal has a 100 iq and in the end somebody took off his masked which benefited for him because nobody knows what his face looks like.   WHO SHALL WIN 150 ARMED VILLAGERS/COPS/FIREFIGHTERS OR MICHEAL MYERS?
Micheal Myers needs to be in mortal Kombat already
I'm gonna be so hyped up when this movie comes out especially since its on my birthday and I've been dressing up as Michael Myers every year for Halloween so now I have an excuse to dress up to watch it on that day 🤣
Bruh this is a gold mine for the Dead Meat channel. So hyped for October!😎💀🔪
cant wait for the dead meat kill count of this
I think Universal is deleting negative comments
The fact they brought Kyle Richards back is a nice little nod
That's the nurse strung up with the witch mask on ..
everything's great but jamie's wig could've been a lot better im just saying
A whole town vs Michael Myers, yup fair enough
The last one was filmed at my school in SC
The last on was filmed at my school in SC
Can't wait
This trailer reminds me of chainsaw texas
I hate when trailers show this much content
#انقذوا_سلوان #SaveSilwan
#انقذوا_سلوان #SaveSilwan
#انقذوا_سلوان #SaveSilwan
This is gonna be fire
LOVE the Halloween 3 masks :D
٢٤ ساعة لهدم منازل أهالي " حي البستان " في سلوان - القدس المحتلة فعلّوا الهاشتاج في كل مكان #انقذوا_سلوان #SaveSilwan
Need to make one where he goes after his creator. That should end this noise.
The scene where he kills the fire-fighters is going to look corny.
Spoiler alert: they will "kill" him in another bullshit way that can't be 100% sure and he'll be back for another sequel
show the whole fuckin movie why dont you jesus christ the art of the trailer is truly fuckin lost
I mean the first 7 movies were cool.
So nobody ever gonna just shoot him in the head. Head shots only. He’s not the wolverine.
let the bogeyman hunt begin
Aww Mikey just wants stabby hugz!
Kyle running faster than she did out that Amsterdam restaurant
1M view's that's how you know this movie finna be good
My fav killer but umm Laurie🤔 you said evil dies tonight🤔 right.... Michael: yo sis you forgot about the final Halloween next year called Halloween ends 2022!
YES!!
“He can’t hurt anyone anymore”  Michael Myers- “And I took that personally”
Gggiiirrrrllllll pppooowwweerrrr Ahahahahhaah
They show too much in these trailers. Also, Michael is supposed to be kind of a normal guy, sneaky. Not popping out of a burning house to kill 10 fire fighters. In the 1st movie he only killed 5 people total (one in 63, 4 in 78)
Un genio Mayer....👏👏👏🤣
Let’s hope the movie it’s good
I haven’t seen a single movie but surely he can be killed yeah ?
Was that Kyle Richards?
Just a speculation right.  In this trailer, one of the main characters says that "Let's hunt Michael". But why do I feel like Michael is going to hunt them first.
Thank God we still have John Carpenter with us.
Sensacional algum brasileiro ansioso aí ?
Is ghis nigga human, gawddamn
Hell nah they gonna try too jump Mikey #gangshit
Michael activated the 5 stars in GTA
looks like the movie is about the whole town queuing for slaughtered by super human michael myers, lol. the story quickly turn to be not that interesting anymore apart from revealing myers current face.
Shouldn't he be suffering from herniated discs and arthritis by now?
In a canon timeline, when does this takes place?
I hope they didn't show all his kills in the trailer.
the top comments are just quotes... like we didn't just watch this..
Shucks this trailer looks like a typical slasher movie which is disappointing.  I loved the last Halloween movie and think maybe it should have ended there.  This movie just looks like another sequel money grab. Maybe it isn't and I'll be pleasantly surprised but I certainly won't be running to see this one.  Instead I'll wait for others to see and review it and then stream it online.
These bed guys are powerful  No one can kill them  No one can hurt them  They kill ppl infront of others  and no one is able to touch them they only shout  These beg guys are powerful 😅🤣🤣😅
https://youtu.be/-RAglyw6ySk
All fine untill Micheal ends up killing John wicks dog
Some weak ass community they have
Every small town had a group of hillbillies and pyro fools just waiting for someone like this. They'd take out Micheal in about 30 minutes. Meh. Cope scare me more than any guy with a mask.
➡️ https://youtu.be/Au3cscgiD4U
Nobody has a machine gun? EVER?
I do like that they put masks from season of the witch in this one
Imagine if micheal learned to shoot a gun, I mean he learned how to drive, all he needs is someone to give him lessons  Also I like the halloween masks on the corpses from the movie that didnt have mikey
YES!!! When are we going to see a Michael Meyers vs Jason Voorhees movie?
I'm excited for this movie I don't know what to say and I loved that they made reference to Halloween 3❤️🎃
A skull mask, a pumpkin mask and a witch mask. I see what you did there
WHATS HALLOWEEN WITHOUT DR LOOMIS AND LAURIE STRODE? #WENEEDDRLOOMIS
Let's go!!
1:05 Este actor siempre hace de novio pendejo.
Thank God Michael ain't wearing a surgical mask lmao
"Let him burn!" Gave me chills
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=4s
🎃 Happy Halloween 🔪
Hopefully I don't fall asleep to this one in the theater.
for once in a halloween movie michael myers is being hunted
BEEN WATCHING SINCE 77, IM IN!!!
micheal taking on fire fighters, cause you know! fire fighters are evil! God I want to see the strode family gone. I really hope this is the last one from david gordon green. Micheal going around taking down GROWN men, is path  tic, and deperate, even for hollywood.  what hollywod has done to everything i love in just 5 years........  You cant even write a comment on this P0S website anymore.   Whatever movie looks terrible. let us MOVE THE ON with the real star, MICHEAL MYERS.  I mean 3 strode leads, its a wonder micheal the STAR gets any screen time, and they want me to take some old lady seriously as a threat to him.  Hollywood thinks we will believe anything. Also someone please bring back ROB ZOMBIE. at least HIS laurie, we could believe.
No wonder why jamie lee curtis called them kick ass strode women in the last movie but not in movie
I can’t decide which movie will end first, the Halloween series or the fast and furious series 😂
YOU WANT YOUR MASK COME AND GET IT
It’s funny how this movie will probably not take place in Halloween if it starts immediately the previous one
Honestly just move out of the country 😂
Looks a great Halloween sequel but will they ever kill Michael he will live forever the way the filmakers are going
what the
possibly the best reboot canon thus far
The  🎻 riffs in the trailers theme song is so dope. 💕 Esp. when alternated with the synth version! 🔪
The last film was rubbish this looks a bit better
🎶 were not gonna take it nooo we ain’t gonna take it!!
I hope there's more deaths in the movie than this trailer. We all want more.
This shit looks great
Only Avengers can stop him now...
He is slow big can't even run  still they can't kill him useless Universe of this Halloween shit
Lmaoo the crazy part is it took them this long to be like let’s hunt him down 😂. Bro if everyone knew he was out there why hasn’t anyone try hunting him down.
There I was, so happy he was trapped in a burning house...then here come the damn firefighters lol
Ayo this looks badass
I really hope though that Allyson isn't getting killed in H:K because that would be such a unexpected killing off twist to the whole Halloween reboot trilogy IMHO.
Give Predator and Terminator to Blumhouse
Every time I hear the name Michael Myers: “Oh behave” or “Yeah, baby! Yeah!”
I dont understand this story line. Laurie strode died halloween ressurection. How can laurie still alive
Holy fucking shit, this looks sick!!!! "Michael Meyers is the essence of evil."
So another stupid halloween movie? C'mon Hollywood ando Danny mcbride
Está chido el slipknot
I was waiting for this 😁
.omg im so glad that scumbag boyfriend from the last one is gonna get it
Sounds like fallout at the beginning 😂
So many Easter 🐣 in this CINEMATIC JOY!
Looks like the black people don't make it 🤷🏽‍♀️
1:33 julian killed
Who else would be sad if this was the last Halloween movie.😢
Seriously? They couldn’t just end it. I thought it was a perfect ending to a story. He was locked in that basement and should’ve burned to a crisp before they even got there.
Captain Kirk got taller
Loving the new violin theme
The only way I will like this movie is if Michael wins and kills everyone
Loves it
so funny nvr dead  after this what next ? time machine like avengers???
Hell yeah
All of a sudden Mike Myers is now the underdog anti hero just fighting to get home. I like it
Wow that's kinda brutal actually
This trailer shown way too much
Did we just see the whole movie ?
Is it just me or is anybody else freaking out about seeing KYLE RICHARDS in this ? Lol like I can't even tell you how buzzing I am haha. Hope she survives tho
The firefighters fighting mike are actual wilmington NC firefighters, and i know a few of em
Ese Michael Myers es el chido, el único. Cuando veremos esta película? Cuando????
Has nobody noticed that at 1:35 she's made to look like Michael? Maybe she turns into the killer in the next movie?
Yall doing too much
The whole town could easily jump his ass can’t wait
Forth of July burns and smokes Valley. Business is good for Friday TV the 13th. You can edit and add to make series. Not.
Damn  White people aren’t afraid of anything
So Michael Myers is rambo now
Here we go with the whole HOLLYWOOD franchise BS deal once more….. MILK IT till it’s plain stupid. So predictable.
Plot twist: Michael Myers is hired by funeral homes , Haddonfield!
Plot twist: Michael Myers is hired by funeral homes , Haddonfield!
Hm. This actually looks pretty interesting.
Why didn’t they call it hunt for the Myers much cooler name
Lest we forget this man is doing all of this damage with only 2 fingers on his left hand.
I like that this trailer has more views in just one day than suicide squad had in two days. Nice.
Producers - how many people should Michael kill ?   Writers - YES !
This looks amazing. So cant wait to see others get excited, and then after its out, complain how terrible it was lol. Never ending thing lol
Stop fucking showing too much in the trailers!!
These kills look brutal
He will die in real life before he dies in the movie....
*dude heres some advice just run dont look back*
Why they don't get a Tank to kill him lmao 🤣😂😂😆
At this point, I’m only here to vibe to the theme tune
I'm Waiting
Another girl power movie, yay 🙄
So do the firefighters try turn based combat instead of attacking at the same time?
Ummm i would Just move the fuck out of that town i ain't going to bother..see ya..!!!!!!!!
It’s littttt!!!!
Well you should’ve known he wasn’t going to die…he’s Michael Myers
This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥 Can’t wait for October to get here!!!!
I’m actually gonna make the prediction that Michael Myers is going to speak in this movie.
Yo that Halloween season of the witch reference!!! This is going to be awesome!!!!
This trailer looks great but it spoiled alot
What's common between Michael Myers and a tiger? When you spot them , they were probably watching you for minutes.

Feel bad for the 👨‍🚒
Damn this has got me excited for some reason. Looks brutal
Is Jamie Lee Curtis a cow? Cuz she milled the hell out of this franchise
How is he not dead?? And his clothes ... fireproof??
Michael hiding behind the bush hearing the whole block is hunting him.  Michael: Aight, I'm out.
Thank you for showing 90% of the good stuff.  Now we can all wait for it to be on TV. 🖕
Damn this gonna be a good movie
Ahh so excited!!! He’s my favorite killer. I can’t get enough of Michael Myers lol 🔥🎃🎃 this looks really good.
This is why i use spine chill🤗
These have always been my favorite movies. Im so excited to finally see this one😁
WWE network
Looks amazing but why give away so many spoilers? We now see how he gets out of the house and probably everyone he kills in the film
DAWG YES
A la madre
he killin everybody!!! omg he super mad! lol damn imagine what they not showin in this trailer 😅
Not watching it thank you for trying, but no. This movie is over exaggerating the kills.
Laurie: He cannot hurt anyone! Michael And I took that personal!
this gon be in a kill count
Okay this fight never stop 🛑 one heroes versus one bad guy now one dead tonight
They got a whole town trying to kill one person and probably still won’t kill him
Ffs another one
Halloween Kills Again in Space
Honest to god Im excited for this and to think my brain was about to say there has been to many movies for halloween 🙄🙄🙄
At the end Michael dies from Covid.
So pumped! Looks amazing!
There's a simple solution to why he survived. He obviously used a potion of fire resistance.
I'm not a pyromaniac, but the first shot was BEAUTIFUL!!!
Another movie? Really?
Jesus loves u all so much Romans 10 and 9.
I'm so excited until that movie comes out
I Wish There Was Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees Vs Freddy Krueger and Chucky.
Did they really not realize people would come to put out the fire? That plan just gets dumber and dumber
Showed way too much.
This looks like the best one yet
Michael looking like Jason Bourne in this shit. I was a van of the older one's, I just think they're gonna go over the top with this.
This looks so good
1:32 THIS IS HALLOWEEN III: SEASON OF WITCH MASKS Lol
The shape stalks again....
Uauuu, showww
Looks like it was totally worth the wait!
Their not gonna stop him? Because it's going to be a trilogy? Didn't they say is was going to be 3 movies?
This is looking promising not gonna lie
Kills look cool but all the dialogue sounds corny af
This makes me wanna go watch it in theaters now!
I just hope they did not show so much in this trailer.
OMG DID I SEE PUMP AND SKID IN THIS TRAILER
This shit fye I been a Halloween fans for 18th years ❤️❤️❤️
I mean did we see all the kill scenes? If not sheesh this is gonna be a slash fest!
I CANT WAIT FUUUUUCK... he is BACK
I’ve been waiting on this for like 2 years 😳
When will this sequel end?!
Please be good please be good please be good
Plot twist : Its actually a trilogy and this is the 2nd part
1:22 oh, tonight it's happening! LMAO
Dude is like 85…he literally killed the whole fire department..
"Michael grinding his knife. And taking a revenge on Laurie for killing him on getting nuke"  Basically my theory
35 seconds in take my money
Laurie : a man couldn’t have survived that fire 🔥 the more he kills ,  the more he transcends .   Me : 👀 what do you mean by that ?
Honestly it kinda gives away too much but obviously we know it's not the end, there's a 4th one coming out
I am excited
We didn't need another Halloween movie but this looks dope asf
Action horror.
🤣 These movies are always so stupid.. how in the hell is a _regular guy_ not dead already?   He got shot about 6 times in one movie and fell out a second story window and yet he still disappeared like Freddy Krueger 🤦‍♂️
Anyone else see the season of the witch reference
This is very spooky
Podem fazer mais de 10 filmes e eu estarei lá assistindo, mesmo que seja ruim eu vou assistir
Bruh I kinda want Micheal to win
This is dope, father doug is here
Doug from the hills have eyes is the only one capable of taking this shit out.
Wilmington,nc baby
The reflection from the firefighters mask of Michael walking out of the burning house is so badass! Hopefully they don’t cut it out of the movie.
1:48 can someone tell me what the mob are shouting??
this is getting ridiculous. how tf did he survived that fire c'mon
They just need to get Jason Voorhees to take this guy out
Micheal myers:*kills off a whole town*     Funeral homes:*its free real estate*
I cant wait to go see this😊
Liking the new theme, going to be tough to top “The Shape Hunts Allison”, but I am looking forward to this.
This is gonna be the finale 4 mic myers
1:03 sounds like the one from “he need sum milk”
the guy kills an entire city and dies to 2 old women and a lesbian. holy shit, rubbish script
This might be the first horror movie I ever watch
Wait Hollywood didn't make him black
Please tell me this is real?
Ah Shit Here We Go Again
In real life 1 seal or marine can fuck that shitty michael up even with all his brute strength. Movies are just exaggerating things.
Blumhouse has again shown way too much in their Halloween trailer. I should have learned after watching the 2018 trailers not to watch but, got sucked in. Way too much of the fire scene was given away.
I liked that they acknowledged that part 3 was a part of the Halloween series.  Even it was a movie for Halloween, the mask was a big part of the 3rd movie.   When I saw the masks and the Silver Shamrock logo on the back of the mask, I was happy to see it.
The dead horse is back for yet another beating
Damn Michael myers is so pissed he's literally killing anyone on sight
Buzzing
He gonna take out half the town but on the squeal halloween ends  they gonna kill his ass for sure
<<<< Crazy Scary
I am so excited for this movie
The shape returns
Now that's call a TRAILER !!!
Only if they could make Jason movies this great
The only way they could kill him is to bring in Shatner! It would confuse Michael! Then Jamie Lee could drown his ass in a vat of Activia! That would be the end of "EVIL"!
just how i like it🔥
I TRULY CANNOT WAIT
They just spoiled the whole movie
Kinda hope Michael kills Laurie. Like dude what’s crazy moment that would be.
Its another one after this isn't it
Ok but why the violin or whatever the fuck
Holy Smokes! I can't wait until October!!
Let's face it, universal ain't gonna just kill him off
I THINK IM IN LOVE
Michael,erledige sie alle 😁😁😁
The film will be crazy !!
this looks amazing!
Finally!! Can't wait!! Michael is back!
The more he kills the more he transcends… let’s give him a whole town to slaughter.
Is this the one where Michael kills for social justice?
If Micheal keeps on killing he might activate the NUKE!
Did anyone else notice the pumpkin, witch, and skeleton in the trailer from that one original halloween movie that had nothing to do with the other halloween movies. Nice to add that it in there.
Halloween has been my favorite movie franchise ever since I saw the first one when I was 4 or 5 years old and it scared the hell out of me.
Tommy doyle is back
She will reach by October by then whole town will be finished by Michael Myers 😐
Putain j'ai hâte il a l'air génial
Amazing
In the last one i literaly said out loud in the movie theater "he isn't dead" the whole room was like "yup"
This looks insane. Like I'm hyped.
One thing for sure is michael myers is damn piss after all the stuff they put him through
Michael vs a whole ass town, huh?  I fear for the town.
Only antifa mob with baseball bats and baking pins can Stop Mike
YYYEEEEESSSSSSSS! 😁😁😁😁
No No No Let him BURN 🔥
Never clicked anything so fast 😂
This shit is so stupid
I loved they showed the masks from Halloween III: Season of the Witch
What a load bollocks lol Hollywood are running out of ideas!
Let show all the kills so know one will come to the movie
60 year olds coming after a superpowered inhuman.  Makes sense.  :/
This is gonna be a dope ass movie 💯 this nigga Michael Myers deadass really on that with the community 😭 he stepped out that burning house and gave them fireman the business ‼️ hyped asf for this movie cause Michael is my all time favorite alongside Jason
bro I'm shaking, he looks more and more brutal, i love him so much
If she cannot stop him..... "Cue the sound of Jason and Freddy".... let's get ready to rumbleeeeeeeeeeeee !!!
Halloween kills...a whole town
Laurie-Evil dies tonight.  Michael Myers-hehe.
Damn they either have a ton of kills in this movie or they just showed us all of them. But i did enjoy this trailer! #TeamMichael
The Purge Vs Michael Myers.
Can they just behead him and move on from the series, JESUS.
"Micheal Myers is flesh and blood." Micheal: Yo fuck you, has anyone ever killed me? This bitch ain't know shit
R.I.P fire men
Should of just done Generators and got outta there honestly
Great! I cannot wait to see it! :)
Really? I think he's done in last movie
Micheal is an immortal. Micheal myers is never gonna die no matter what lol 😹
45.76.207.246/207?/18+recomended  Youtube: This is fine Someone: Says "heck" Youtube: BE GONE однако я люблю таких рыбаков
A great nod to Halloween 3 there. 👍
I'm actually happy that that Halloween kills is coming out this year because Halloween 2 is going to turn 40 years old this October and even though it's not canon anymore it's still the best Halloween sequel in my opinion.
He's really not that bad of a guy people, just got to know him.
WHEN THE TRAILER GIVES AWAY THE WHOLE MOVIE!!!! THANKS FOR SAVING ME THE MONEY
Well atleast we know we should get 2 more movies based on the originals
Just call military
If Michael Myers is the boogeyman, why not send in John Wick? Send in the baba yaga and be done with it.
Im liking all the blood and gory
How come the cops couldn't kill or catch Micheal Myers until they need to rely on an old lady to hunt him down
Can’t wait it’s gonna be the best movie ever 🍿🔥
Idk i think this could be a good final film because everyone from the past halloween movies are coming back to fight michael even everyone in the neighbour hood i just dont know how halloween ends will end this
i hope Michal wins
I think they showed a little too much in that trailer no?
Siiii estaba esperando este momento desde hace trillones de años!!!!
So they're going for kill count instead of atmosphere and horror elements. Shame.
Michael "The Undead" Myers is back!
These are fucking brutal deaths
I feel kinda bad for the firefighters
James A. Jannise: Lets get to the kills >:D
The 1978 original is one of my favourite horror films... hope this turns out to be just as good!
"Evil dies tonight" Nope. Evil has to live until they are done milking the franchise.
Once again the trailer becomes the whole film because the training of people who make these trailers is low grade. Not that it takes that much from the usual Halloween slasher script but please, know that a trailer supposed to tease you enough to make you go buy a ticket to see the actual film. Sigh!
Laurie: "He can't hurt anyone ever again"  Micheal: "So anyway I started stabbing"
My nigga Micha Myes is comin bike to woop dat ass like a OG mfks thought y’all hadeem dead but finna find ot just how much of a real killa my nigga is fasho
I think in this one its tier 3 michael
The only person responsible enough to wear a Mask... Michael Myers. 😂😂
when this film gonna end
anyone else get goosebumps when Michael slammed Lyndsey Wallace against the car? 02:00 - 02:01 🔥  This film looks badass!!!!🎃💀🔪
Dead by daylight will have a new chapter for this killer when this comes out lol
Cannot wait!
Well I know now who gets killed in this film who appeared in the previous one. And those who appeared in the sizzle reel. Great...
Al fin alguien se acuerda que existe Halloween en pandemia gracias 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Where are the mf who criticizes Rob Zombies Michael Myers for being to brutal and to loud ? Lmao
WHY WOULD THEY SPOIL SO MUCH?!?! Like damn bro we are gonna see it anyways.
Let it burn
My man is just trying to get home and people keep getting in his way.  Smh.
This fricking hype i gotta wait
Blumhouse production always rocks
I love halloween kills l cant vait to siat 🎃🔪
No Donald pleasance no Halloween
Naw this shit hard though I can’t wait till it drop
Talk about to many Rocky movies being ridiculous. Now this is getting absurd
The reviews be like: Dang that's a lot of blood, 8.5/10
I’m very excited for this movie but I’m just hoping it won’t be a Halloween Resurrection situation again and completely ruin this timeline
Wow. Good job Hollywood. Milk it some more
Who came here after halloween explaintion by citizen Z
Michael Myers returns
This senior citizen is getting stronger..
Horrible 😬😬😬😬😬😬😬👌👌👌👌👌💯💯💯💯💯
Shitty cast
Ini yang kutunggu"
Just use guns bruh
They could just tie her up to a tree and let him have her... It's obvious he's not going to let it go and he's hurting innocent people because of their family drama
I want this at HHN 30
And when i thought covid will be this years Halloween, Halloween arrived.
Apparently the most r rated trailer ever
O MY DEAR IM SO HELLA HYPED FOR THIS
I like how they did a call back to Halloween 3 with the mask of the pumpkin, skeleton, and the witch
Still wait the thing from universal please universal
infinite tier 3 myers.
I "KNEW" I SHOULDN'T HAVE WATCH THIS "ENTIRE MOVIE-- MOVIE TRAILER!"  NOW THE "ANTICIPATED THRILL" IS ENTIRELY "☠!"
Hi Limmy
Frick you for the sing trailer, i was watching something scary and your ads just came like wth dude
Youtubers who count the kills and how to survive horror movies are gonna love this
So when I was younger Michael Myers was definitely one of my bigger fears for sure, but then I got older and I kinda realized he’s not really that scary… then I actually started watching a couple of the movies and low key realized it’s kinda just like watching John Wick
I’m rooting for Michael, feel sorry for him the way they all hunting the poor guy 😂
i thought i’ve had enough of the halloween franchise but this actually looks good👀
This got me so hyped, I need this movie now
those halloween costumes are the same ones from season of the witch! this looks so good!
It's getting old and stupid already. End the damn trilogy  already
“Evil dies tonight” actually it dies in the next movie
Seems like they just kept showing an awful lot of content… Odd. Kills aren’t everything, story is quite literally integral.
So is this the canon Halloween 3
Lol people actually thinking he's gonna die 😂😂😂
Looks like a worthy sequel by the body count alone!
BRING JASON BACK 2 FIGHT THIS PUNK! WHO THE HELL KILLS OLD LADIES FOR NO REASON.
This looks great but I feel like I've just watched most of the movie in this trailer.
let's skip july aug & sep !!
Damn bro love it already
hyped af
Plz stop this serial killer phobia. SERIAL KILLER LIVES MATTER.
I've watched this trailer 5 times since it came out and still get chills
🎃🔪💀 awesome movie ! M.Myers " The best"!
Le bete le bete wah mauj kr di 🔥
Yer goddamn right
Welcome to the Kill count
ну и ночка будет
Imagine, your a firefighter and you see a masked man walk out of a blazing fire, what would you do.
One of the best killer story ever 😍 cant wait to see
The real hero will be Ben Tramer coming in to end the nightmare.
This time Michael is pissed 🔪
This literally makes no sense. The firemen would just put out the fire and how in the hell did Michael not die or his clothes catch on fire at least? His mask is plastic too.
The only good thing about this trailer is the violin version of the Halloween theme. Everything else was just more cliche SSDD.
I think Fast and Furious saga will be like this franchise @@
Looks good but Michael gotta be about 80 years old 🤣
I like the beginning fight with the fire fighters scene
They’re really milking this franchise.
Congratulations universal on showing your entire movie though trailer keep up the terrible work👍
Imagine him killing John Wick's dog. It would be epic.
It disappoints me to see that this man just killed like 10 armed firefighters as if they were defenseless children😢
The only crazy thing is how in the hell he survive this fire?
Cant wait for Halloween / Fast Furious crossover!
Wooowwe
The last time they gave a trailer clip they gave so much scenes in 1 minute if I’m not mistaken
First there where Halloween. Than there where Halloween Kills. And NOW... Halloween Kills IN SPACE! [Rated R]
This movie can just drop dead. The H4O (Halloween 2018) didn't make sense. Laurie trained for years for her own protection just because Michael killed 5 people 40 years ago instead of 30 people. They should have added the other movies to this one so it can add up. Except for Resurrection.
At this point they just abusing this movie
My men is back.Lets go baby 💪💪
So we are forgetting about Halloween 2 which, though just a follow on, was still better than 2018 and we are going have them running around a hospital, just like🤔???? Oh yeah Halloween 2. Just stop it with these 6/10 remakes please. How about Hollywood actually greenlights some new ideas that are probably not even getting read. The 2018 just lifted most of the set pieces from all the other films. It was basically terminator 2. Mom is nuts, no one believes her and her kid is trained in using weapons for when the terminator returns
CRONATION To The Moon💪🏼💯🚀📈🔥
watch out Thanos! Michael's gonna take your throne. 🔪🎃
Esto es hermoso 🖤🗡🔥
ooweee am in u son of a ditch
TAKE MY HAND  michael myers: i got you fam
“He can’t hurt anyone ever again.” Micheal: “Who decided that?”
Michael gets to kill the whole town.. Then Treyarch sbmm kicks in and next movie he goes against freddy kruger and Jason woorhees
They've totally forgotten what made this guy so terrifying, suspense, and silence
why does micheal seem like hero trying to reach his goal and the others are trying to stop him
How many of you caught the Halloween 3 Season of the witch reference.
Esse é o comentário brasileiro que vc estava à procura. Então, toma ! Michael Myers está insano, Jamie Lee Curtis está foda e eu vou estar no cinema em outubro. Pode apostar 🔪🎃👏🏼
The firefighters should have just done gens and everything would have been okay
This is EPIC. I loved the first one (i mean the sequel of 2018. Cause the 1978 is a masterpiece obviously. This looks even more brutal. Can't wait for It.
The legend is back
THIS MOVIE IS GOING TO BE GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That starting made me scared. 😱
https://youtu.be/7zi0eBIMRdY
bruh, its america and not a single person has a gun
So now he’s fire proof too?
Did anybody notice they recreated the original/cut ending of H18, but with Allison instead of Laurie (having the knife turned on her, screaming “Do it!”, etc.)?
Silly
If you Believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins then Resurrected three days later and is our Lord and Savior you will be saved ! He who is sinless died on the cross for our sins just so we could be here. He is the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords from generation to generation! Read your bible daily and please Repent!! God bless you and your. family! (Not trying to force my religion upon anyone who doesn’t agree)💜
from the trailer is incredible
Lets go Michael Myers
The shape my slasher 🔥
amazing ♥️💀
We all hope will come out in UK soon this year at cinemas? ☺
ultimate Goosebumps
This is going to be more brutal than the others and I can not wait - This looks AMAZING.
They are dumb to not realize that the fire department are ofc going to come. Don’t get me wrong I love these movies but sometimes… I dunno, ppl in movies are just dumb😂🤝
Man wtf they spoiled so much
No 4K trailer?
Props to that fireman who tries to kill Michael with a saw, even though he just saw him walk out from a burning building and slaughtering his mates.
these make for better trailers than movies
🤤
The boogeyman is coming
0:13 LMAO
Can they please just kill Michael Myers PLEASE!?
I thought the last one was disappointing but I feel like this one will be really good
wow this  nice movie is gonna release on my birthday nice gift
God I love Halloween. The movies and the holiday
so tired....   They need to come up with something cool like they did with Halloween 6 in 1995.    Instead they just write this shit in their sleep.
The song sounds weird
Ok, ok, alright 🙌 I’ll give this one an opportunity
I WANT IT NOW *Family Guy
We are making a movie 'Monster Masher'    do the monster mash.
So it’s gonna be like Halloween 4?
Me here waiting for another Friday the 13th film: Bruh.
Wow it looks like their’s gonna be way more killin than usual 😯 instead of Michael vs Laurie, it’s more like Michael vs. everyone which is so cool.
Is it just me or is he more like Jason
This is gonna be lit  maneeeee
Cool
Yah ini mah masuk indo durasinya cuma setengah jam. Sisanya disensor.
Same shit different horror movie.
the fireman tried to kill Michael with a goddamm chainsaw?? He didn’t deserve to die
Hopefully the entity will not be displeased with michael myers' moring everyone
Again ?
😍😍😍
If they kill Myers in ends, they can make a more effective anthology.
Please, oh please, never ruin the 69k likes
Lame. I hate drawn out franchises like this.  They’re clearly just setting up COVID vs Jason in 2022.
Why did they ever think setting the house on fire would be enough? This is going to turn into Saw Vs Michael Myers
What is this guy? Garou from OnePunchman?
HOLY SHT!!!!!  LOOKS AWESOME
Can't wait!!! This will be awesome!
What's the name of the new song they're using for the theme is that a violin?
Jamie Lee Curtis is my favorite character and  she's kick butt she beat the hell out of Michael in the first new one🤣🤣🤣🤣
He better not dieeee
Michael not with that talking shit, you either about it or not.
This is giving me Halloween: Curse of Michael Myers vibes, I'm so disappointed as a Halloween fan! They said they were trying to move away from the far fetch storyline of Halloween 4 - Halloween Resurrection, but this is just the same recycled bullshit! Halloween 2018 was epic and an original concept! But this movie has now ruined the new Trilogy!
Well, I guess I’ve seen the whole movie now
The year is 2063: Halloween Kills.......again
Love that Kyle Richards is in this.
Michael my BELOVED ‼️Man do I love this man so much,,,if he dies in this 🧍🏽. I’m gonna lose my shit.
I hope what they do in dead by daylight is change the Michael theme to this , only if you choose to
I like how their not just focusing on Laurie and her family but a whole community
2020 or 2018 when his new movie came out I want to see the part 2 of it which is this one
Next - MM vs Army ..
I really love the image of Michael standing on the porch holding the Halligan Bar.  The tool that’s saved so many in those lethal hands.  Shivers.
Amazing 🤩 I like it
Michael's never goona let go of the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis gave the Terminator a pole dance like  a stripper instead of him. ...now this makes me waana watch "careless sister" again . 🤣
The original COVID-19 mask wearer.
Why are they still bothering at this point.  Let this franchise stay dead.
I'm looking forward to it, but I gotta say, I feel like this is not how you do a trailer. I got less than half way through the trailer and it already showed like 6 kills. Unless there will be like 30, that's just way too much to put in a trailer.
Piano tune on violin sell it imo😆
Only way to stop Michael Myers irl:  Pull his mask off and cut it up.  (Since fire can't melt his mask). No Mask. No Michael Myers. No Powers.
All that’s left is Michael vs the US military
Fuck, you show way too much!
After Watching "The Little Things" Which Had No Action In It What-So-Ever, I Am Sincerely Looking Forward To Watching This Film.
Am I pumped for this? Yes. Do I feel like they basically showed the entire film? Yes. I hope I'm wrong.
GEIL 💪🏽
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Is it me or are they recycling the old franchise, which I thought that's what they are getting away from? Getting away from the stupid over the top supernatural shit that ruined the original franchise? So disappointed! Thought they were trying to do something new and original! So disappointed!
i hope they don't turn this in to a cheap ass sjw feminist movie
If first sequel was about a Laurie Strode Vs Michael Myers then this is about Michael Myers Vs the entire town. The hunt begins
1982: stop it! STOP IIIIITTT!!!!!  2021: Do it! DO IIIIITTT!!!!!!!
I'm here after watch again the first Halloween for the few times...
Yesssss!!!!!👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
It looks like the whole plot will cover hours only after the end of the first installment and this is SO EFFING COOL
Michael with a buzz saw?  We better see him use the jaws of life on a fireman as well. That’ll be hella ironic.
The firefighter scene at the beginning alone got me hyped lol
So this is evil within 4?
Michael Mayers Turing out to be the new Jason 🙄😂♥️
I could kill Michael myers, just give me five minutes
The director must love the 3 masks from Halloween 3, as they've been in both movie's
I normally never watch horror movies, but this looks like it's going to be fucking amazing.
Please let this be the last one
This is gona be lit🎃🍁 I feel bad for the firefighters tho😥
Seriously they showed every kill.
At this point they might as well need to call the avengers to defeat Myers
FUCK YEEEEES!
Yayyyyyy can’t wait
Rambo Vs Michael Myers Make it happen Sly!
Is Michael Myers "that guy."?
They've got to call John wick now
I need one Mike Myers in my life ❤️❤️❤️ if you know what I mean
Now for the stupid ppl thinkim the first trailer was just a fan trailer Now it’s official
He is gonna destroy full fuking city
Michael Myers owns Halloween day bruh
I like the idea where everyone hunting Michael but also Michael hunting everyone
Anyone that survived the last movie knew this was coming
To soon ??
I haven't seen these movies, but how old is Michael? Does he have an immunity to pain or something?
At last! I've been waiting for this. Trailer looks really good 😉 Can't wait to see it!
Dont kill Micheal, we need more sequel.
Prime Bruce lee wouldn’t utterly fuck Michael Myers up. The speed, the power, the killer instinct. Goodnight Michael.
I really don't get it.. from what michael myers made of? Bulletproof, fireproof, sharp objectproof, shittyproof, and many more proof.. They said " no matter how fast you run, michael myers can walk faster "
jesus, just show all the kills & the whole movie why don't ya??
*michael going on a 10 kill streak* "predator missile ready for launch"
Jeez That woman's entire generation will die out of age but Michael never dies!!!!
Decisive Strike attacking again, you Laurie Strode evil!
If all 3 movies are set on this one Halloween night then that's going to one hell of a triple bill to watch
Only one word.... WOW
まじで楽しみ！！！日本での公開はいつごろだろ！！！
love that the next one is called halloween ends but mainly because all these three movies are the same night haha he could still live
Looks bad ass hell yeah can’t wait 🔥
Can’t wait for it to come out 💪
You can’t steal his Shatner mask
I used to not like Scary movies much, but the IT movies really got me interested in them, and now I hunt for the good ones, this one certainly looks good….
I'm sure this comment will be buried, but I did a fun reaction vid to this trailer! Can't wait!
Her screaming let him burn gave me chills
Laurie been saying she was gone end Michael since 1978, it’s 2021 atp Imma have to step in..🤺🔪🔫😩
He’s alive? …. Okay 👍
2:15 notice how Michael standing in a front door way an the car u partially see in the back then nxt u see the mom standing outside w the same car there w his mask she probably runs up from behind an takes his mask or hit em then took it
When I watched the trailer a couple of dozen times!! I thought when the movie 🍿 comes out in October, the entire movie theatre is going to go crazy! It will be the perfect atmosphere…the comments in the theatre are gonna fly. Everyone will be in on it, and by the way the ‘Bogeyman’ never dies! Show them how it’s done Michael!! Totally 🔥 🔥 lit!! Luv ya stay safe the Bogeyman is watching !! LA from Toronto🇨🇦 2021
Jesus Christus is coming soon guys open your eyes he's loving you so much change u mind and oben u heart he will safe u soul for more read the Bible and you will see its the truth in there.
Am i the only one who finds this movie something in resemblance with THE PURGE ?
Mike wazouski went from killing 5 people per movie to killing half the town
Yyyyyyyyyeeeeeeeessssssss I didn’t want him to die I was like noooooo…..keep the franchise alive
it's a crime that Michael still absent from Mortal Kombat
SUMMER IS CANCELED!!! EVERYONE GET TF READY FOR FALL AND HALLOWEEN!! IM TALKING BRING OUT THE HALLOWEEN DECOR, ALL THE SCARY MOVIES BC MICHAEL MYERS IS COMING BITCHES ‼️
Great we watched the whole movie in this trailer... they will never stop milking this franchise
Michael dies tonight one way or another
너무 기대되요~ 미국의 향기 너무 좋습니다 ^^
😏💯
Well damn they really showed everything didn't they          Cept where Lorie dies of course
The dialogue sounds like it`s going to be torture to sit through.
Make a new Freddy or Jason movie seen too many Halloween and chucky.
Продолжение ?? Вы что , серьёзно? Прошлая часть провалилась
This trailer’s looking like the whole movie already.
Trailer reveals all the killings... lol
can't wait to see this movie
“Evil Dies Tonight “ Halloween Ends What’s up?
could’ve thought of a better movie title.
അവനെത്തി. നിർത്തിയിടത്ത് നിന്ന് വീണ്ടും തുടങ്ങാൻ He's back to kill more 🔥🔥👍👍✌️✌️
Can we just appreciate how bad ass Jamie Lee Curtis is? She’s brilliant and I loved the reboot too. I’m so excited for this one too.
Michael Myers is like Undertaker 😂
Really i mean how old has mike got to be, just let it go.
i'm so excited for this
Imagine Carnage symbiote attaching itself to Michael. #megacarnage
don't show his face please
🥱
Michael Myers: I’m gonna do what’s called a pro gamer move
I AM SO FUCKING HYPED FOR THIS MOVIE
0:59 😢 I have a feeling Jamie lee Curtis character will die in the end 😞 The theme at 1.5x
Fuck this looks like it’s gonna be amazing.
More like a trailer for Terminator... I'll be back !
He may wipe out the whole town but at least he doesn’t kill the baby
They should end it with this movie once and for all with a bang
Oh dead meat
Who read 🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃
Michael Myers is just trying to ascend with Gorb. Leave him alone
Lori gonna train the rest of the town to fight michael dope
🔥
Talk about a Trailer that ruins the Film, they showed all his Murders happen so what else is there?
Judging by the trailer it looks like he got pretty far so yeah they pretty much hyped up the town to their death
OHHHH SHOOOOTTTTTTTT IM READYYYY
Michael will never look cool, still am excited though
Goosebumps.
You mean to say a man survived a burning house and then had the time to kill and chainsaw all the firemen... were the firemen all waiting in a line to be massacred?
Those who have disliked the video should be sent to the gulag
Ima stop watching this trailer cuz they are really showing us all the killings and plot in less then 90 seconds….
At this point, he's immortal.
He can't die ,he is immortal
Finally been waiting for this movie
After 23 years of shit, we might finally have a solid Halloween movie...
Michael never Dies 🔪🔪🔪
Not sure if Halloween movie or another Avengers movie 🤔
What's left to watch? Everything is in the trailer.
Damn he ain't gone never die 😭🤣
Ohh Im for sure getting fucked up in the theater for this movie
I feel like I don’t even have to watch the movie now......I’m still gonna watch it tho
🥱😒🖕
I knew this was gonna be mad stuupid
My man is on a mission! 👏
This will be fun 🔥
Ok now this looks really good.
Jamie will be a great great grandma still running from Michael
On this installment of, lets beat dead horse.
I’m will watch
So thats how he became Freddy 🤔
They should put the text like  "1 town... 1 night... 1 men..."
"Evil dies, TONIGHT!  Ya know,  like for real this time. Totally mean it. No, I'm serious this time."
Kill count will be high
Jason voorhees comes in the movie Jason voorhees:Surprise mf
Should be called "Halloween Bores " ..how many fookin times are people gonna watch this rehashed bollocks .. my god ..unreal zero originality same old shit
OH MY GOD THIS LOOKS SOO GOOD!!!!!
Lol
I want John Wick Vs Michel myers.
Another one...
Michael Myers be like:hum amar hain b#$dk😅
I’m calling Wanda this time
looks amazing  I cannot wait.
why did they spoil half the kills
👌
Hollywood on its way to ruin another classic. All the advancement in shooting equipment, special effects hollywood still fails to match the unsettling and eerie nature of Old classic horror films.
This is wack bring back rob zombie edition
Myers: Still Alive. Everyone: "How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man"
Oh yeah!!!!!!
Michael Myers had to have at least 5 Nuke killstreaks  and seems like he could get a few in just this movie.
Trailer hella raw. This wouldn't have been shown on channel 5 when I was a kiddo
Loveeee the silver shamrock mask cameo!
Halloween Kills, just not Michael Myers it seems.
You might as well of showed the whole movie. Trailers show too much anymore.
I don’t get why they don’t release it on Halloween
Let's go Mayers 🤜
"LET HIM BURN!" is my favorite line from Jamie Lee Curtis
Now why would Michael Myers kill the firefighters??
Michael "The terminator" Myers
I don't need to watch the movie, thanks for spoiling all the kills
Yeah I'm believe he will survive
Its getting old and stupid, this money grabbing franchise needs to be put to rest.
how many times She have to kill him? lmao
The Devil-- is the Definition of EVIL   Micheal Myers-- Hold my beer bitch.
https://www.instagram.com/reel/CQhdkz5hEd4/?utm_medium=copy_link
Okay,  So, the firefighters were villains and Michael Myer was the bollywood hero. Single handedly killed em all.
Looks like evil is not gonna end soon 🤣
How many times have we heard "he's dead".
Let me guess, this movie will end in them killing Michael Myers ALLEGEDLY and then he somehow survives so another movie is yet again made.
It makes me nervous to only see scenes of JLC in the hospital...
"Evil dies tonight!" Since Halloween Ends is out at 2023, it won't be *this* night
So Fuckin good cant Wait
Didnt he just get three fingers blown off by a shotgun? Im surprised he can still murder as if nothing happened lol.
Ah, yes, I see they’ve given us pretty much the whole movie (plot and most good scenes) in this one trailer
Leave the damn firefighters alone, they were just doin' their job 😭
https://youtu.be/McvKR-UsQJA
The trailers for the first one was better. Just showing kill after kill after kill...i don't know.  Was hoping for more suspense and thriller.
Why do we have to wait till October!!!!!!!?
Quickly! Show every single scene in the movie! People who make these trailers wouldn't even pass year 7 drama class.
Yes, please
“Evil dies tonight” * *laughs in 6 more sequels and a remake**
This is a last movie of Michael Mayers
I just hope this movie will have some good suspence and not just action!
Seems like another warzone  update
Technically Danielle Harris can exist in these Halloweens regardless of her being in Zombies version… Everyone wanted to see her and Jamie Lee together…Apparently they have never even met… which seems crazy to me, Danielle said that to some random Q&A people on IG during lock down N shit last year. Damn shame..
OMG!!!
You want your mask..??? COME AND GET IT !!!‼️‼️
😂😂😂 I can't, I'm a big Halloween fan but this new stuff is funny.
Are we in October yet????🤩
Michael Wick
Do any of u fill bad when Michael Myers kills the elders
Why can't October come faster I want to see this movie
Wow, this looks excellent.
Just call Florida Man and he’ll take care of him
Love the Halloween 3 Easter Egg
Looks very promising
Looks fckn shit just took it too far 1st one was the best always will be and the 2nd wasnt tht bad had tht same feel to it but after that what the fck
I just saw the title click to confirm n stop ima wait till this hits theaters n not ruin or spoil alert just kill Michael just kill
How is Michael still alive?😂
Welcome to the kill count where we tally up the victims in all our favourite horror movies! I’m James A Janeese and today we’re looking at Halloween Kills!
Too much! Less is better. This is practically the whole movie
Meh
Honestly that's hysterical. Michael escapes because the firefighters show up? I laughed. Still really looking forward to this movie though.
Partial Purge.  This looks thrilling though.
This is prolly gonna be more like an action movie than horror...can’t wait though
https://youtu.be/9wRdJPQslUA
It looks awesome I just hope its not one of the trailers where a majority of the kills and what not is in the trailer
wheres the swat team at
Always loved "Halloween" films, even tho some of the installments were average. This looks epic
Don’t show us all the kills ! Lol
😯
Within the time these movies have been released my mom weant from a 5 year old to a 40 year old with 3 kids One of said kids are now binging the movies mother watched as a kid Can yall just kill him off already???
Thought they weren't going the whole supernatural thing 🙄 any man who had been stab and left to burn wouldn't have the strength to walk let alone kill a dozen are so highly trained fireman ..
I didn’t like the other one, but with that being said, I was still curious to see what they’d do with this one. Unfortunately, I think this looks dumb, and this trailer is wack
Okay, great trailer. Except it showed the whole movie.
He is still alive 😂😂🙄😂🔫
I bet they showed all the best kills in the trailer
I wish we could have a batman crossover with this haha
She can kill Michael Myers not even Freddy Krueger can kill this son-of-a-b****
Finally a slasher is being hunted. But please call Ash is an expert at killing the undead . Broomstick is super op. Or better yet bring military firearms.  Hope Michael doesn't kill dozens of hunters while tanking all bullets.  Jason was killed by SWAT members,  and Jason is a bigger monster then Michael
That theme song gets me HYPED!!!
Of course they let him out. After lori carefully constructed that damn trap and the let him out😩😩😩🤦🏾‍♂️
Ah yes, another trailer that shows all the jump scares in advance.
😔😟We need Tamil dubbing 🤗😉
Can't wait
Imagine spoiling basically the whole movie and deaths in the trailer.
When the whole town is autistic & cant kill a single dude in 50 years. smh
How???? If he survived fire, it means he is born of fire, hence a demon has taken over the body. Only Michael's childhood memory remains from neglectful loved ones, an abusive stepfather and an entire town who knew the truth of his situation and did nothing about it. So his memory remains that of a vengeful spirit. Plot twist: Michaels soul is in hell and his torment grows worse with each kill. But he finally accepts his fate and forgives those who wronged him which renders the demon powerless and is finally able to be killed. All the while Michaels spirit communicates to Laurie and helps her track the demon down and dispose of him. Ending scene: as the demon is sent to hell, Michael grabs it and wraps it in chains and holds on to him as they both descend into the deepest and darkest parts of hell. The remaining family members and neighbors ask forgiveness for any part they had in neglecting Michael and forgive him. The sun rises on the town indicating the town has been cleansed. Just my rendition. Would love to see a horror movie that ends in forgiveness and redemption.
How does Jamie Lee Curtis come out in these movies is she died in the Halloween movies that were made already
I'm already eager for the sequel. Shame H20 is no longer canon though. Would've been a nice touch if John Tate and Karen Nelson were half siblings from Laurie's different marriages. Would've been a hell of a family reunion.
In the end; Laurie points a gun at the firefighters.  Laurie: LET IT BURN YOU GUYS!!!!
Looks like my boy Mikey got his work cut out for him
MYERS/VOORHEES 2024 VOTE OR DIE
That opening is so dreadful, I love it
I think I just watched the whole movie
Yes! I got chills! I’m so excited to see this in the theater, especially after all the COVID bs.
Ssssoooo... an all female cast, when she has a still very much alive son... What, did he say "pick a finger", and that was the end of his existence? I'm sure Josh wouldn't mind, Michael could be after his kids too.
Laurie is hunting Michael now… huh.
1:33 that’s cool those are the masks from Halloween 3
how is this only the trailer and we see like 10 kills 😂😂😂😂 I'm here for it!
I can't wait for this movie!
Michael Myers be like "You should have gone for the head!"
💯🐐💉🔥🔥🔥🤘🏾
0:16 - 0:45 Geez, I know he's the Boogeyman, but Michael's not John Wick. AND WHERE THE HECK IS BACKUP!?!?!?!
this looks so good 🔥🔥 i can't fuckin wait to see it
At this point man.... what are you gonna do? THE MAN CANT DIE
HOLYYYYYYYY SHIT NEW HALLOWEEN MOVIE LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Micheal Myers be like : hehe I’m not dead until I say I’m dead 😈👹
At this point I believe Michael can survive from Godzilla
Finally he’s back
FUCKIN' FIREFIGHTERS GE'IN FUCKED!
Can’t wait till this comes out and the whole town vs one Michael Myers 😳😂
So he is never going to die right?
Damn I normally don't watch Trailers due to "showing the whole movie" nowadays, but man these executions by Michael are EPIC! gives off Mortal Kombat fatalities vibe.
I wish trailers would stop showing the entire movie. I stopped at 1:16.
So the entire town is gonna team up against him 😯
WOW A KING
I thought this was a fake trailer 😂 Can't wait til this comes out
This looks AMAZING. My only gripe is they gave away a few too many of Michael's ambushes imo. I'm excited for this!
If only the board had listened to Dr.Loomis years ago 🪑
I spotted the three masks from Season of the witch! Nice reference in there
Trailer showing way too much
Remember when Saw used to be the annual Halloween time movie?
This needs to end
So this is not Machete Kills?
He’s the last of the Big 3 to get a good continuation. This is going to be a bl00d bath.
THIS IS NOT EVEN THE LAST MOVIE SO I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE HOW IT FUCKING ENDSSS
Why tf is so gooddddddddd
One word describes this whole trailer: brutal.  In a great way.
We all know we're going to buy a ticket.  It's Michael Myers.  Must watch.
I don't know what the comments are talking about, this literally looks terrible.
This is hype
A "Halloween" area at Universal would be cool
Dead by daylight
siapa dari malaysia?
I like the Halloween 3 easter eggs
This looks so god damn good
And Karen
He's still alive
can someone tell me  what i have to watch before this movie?
I been waiting a long time for this movie Laurie better die
I really hope that death battle will be able to do live action again soon so we can have Jason vs Michael. I'd prefer if they did only parts 2-4 Jason and Rob zombie series Michael since they were actually mortal In those and died at the end, They'll probably composite them  From my limited knowledge, Jason has better Regen, durability, overall better strength, and quicker speed while Micheal is smarter and more tactical. I think Jason's Regen is too much for Micheal to handle and if we included Uber Jason from X then Micheal gets stomped even harder.
I’m really excited for this but I hope it’s not going the route of Michael having to do with some supernatural curse again.
I love the idea of an angry mob going after Michael instead of the slasher horror trope of people isolating from each other and getting picked off one by one.
Micheal vs. The public. Yes!! Come out in the shadows you freak!
"Oooooooooohhhhhh spooky" says my brain
Omg is die do I wont hav 2 see another 1 of them
Michael is on John wick mode
Did anyone catch the season of the witch masks??? Sooo dope😁🤘
Is it just me but I thought police pull up with the ambulance and the fire trucks
Yeahh !
im waiting for Paul rudd to come back
From the trailer it seems we are getting more gore
Hell yeah
Please please upload full movie
I want Michael Meyers to speak in this one. It would be a suprise twist.
Anyone notice the Silver Shemrock masks from Halloween III??
IM SO EXCITED!!!!!!! YASSSSS ANOTHER HOLLOWEEN MOVIE! ❤💁‍♀️💃
Pretty much the whole town wants Michael but sacrificing 90% of the town to kill one man army
Oh no they are still making these
Seems Laurie doesn't leave the hospital. I guess that's the last one with Jamie Lee Curtis and that'd be a shame really. I liked her badass persona. We'll see I guess.
How many movies we got now of this? 13? Not being rude here, but like, the plot has been so stretched out over the years-
0:58 well there goes the Micheal sees himself in child's theory
He's been doing this for 40 years just let the man fucking die.
….. I’d watch it…. Even though he’ll never die! 😆
Must be the cousin of Jason who never got attention
He going HAM!!!! LETS GOOOO!!!! and I love he's not a secret anymore
I'm back baby.
Spooky
Doesn't the fact that there is another movie after this one mean that Michael wont die in this movie and kind of ruins the suspense? I still love this series and will likely enjoy the movie, but the same suspense isn't there. Maybe this movie is more about the faceoff between Michael and the community and how he just fucks shit up.
These new Halloween movies are a joke compared to the old ones.
I feel like we just watched the movie..
YOOOOO, that scene with fire fighters was lit asf! Definitely worth seeing In theaters!
out of all the Halloween movies which are the canon???
Michael Myers is gon die
They just showed the whole movie
#9 ON TENDING
Grab my hand!!! AAAAAHHHHHH!!!!
Justs let the franchise die. These are all trash.
Thanks for ruining the whole movie 👍
Whoever put this trailer together should be fired. It ruins EVERYTHING. We know how Michael escaped now! We’ve seen the random kills! Who survived the last movie, but won’t make it in this one! Who’s coming back from the original ‘78 movie! The Easter Eggs! They’ve even revealed Michael’s motivation.  Why bother watching this in the theatre!?
Hell yeh 🔥🔥🔥
“Evil dies tonight” lol yea I’d believe that but we already know there’s going to be a third film. 😬
Huge Halloween fan but I'm just not feeling this he should have died the last movie now I feel like they're just milking it
When Michael Myers vs Jason Voorhees  ?
amyone else like the little nod to season of the witch in the park?
I cannot wait to see this!  This looks so fucking epic!  And can we all take a moment to appreciate that Jamie Lee Curtis is 62 years old, and still such a fucking badass!
Once again, the trailer is showing too much.
Oh shit, I really wanna watch this movie, and that’s a lot, coming from someone who is really tired of these never ending sequels 😨😨😨.
Fuck yes!
Now this time there will team up and kill micheal
My mans always getting jumped lol 1v200
Can't wait for it, my fave slasher series all the time.Classic masterpiece of horror <3,hope It won't be the last part,because you can't kill the Boogyman :)
Can’t wait 😛 looks like a good time at the movies 🍿👍 Michael Myers ✅ October ✅ Slashers ✅
Jason is back
Love the Halloween III reference.
Great. The cliffhangers already revealed
Jason: *dies from a machete to the head*  Micheal: *comes out of a fire building without a scratch*
*Hey, to you reading* .. you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Megan Buchanan  Micheal Myers Can't go to die again ..He alive and evil...Halloween Kills ..Micheal Myers will KILL all of people in Haddonfield Illinois..He very BAD!
Ohohohoho
I can't wait! I love the Halloween movies! Me and my brother John are huge fans. The boogie man is back and badder and ever! Just remember one thing about Michael Myers, you can't kill the boogie man!
Wow! I think 17 people were killed in the trailer.
James A. Jannise is finna have a whole field day with this one 😭😭😭
The hunter is getting hunt tonight.
Anyone wanna come with me to watch it when it releases?
It’s June
cant wait letsgoooo wow this is going to be great come october
They gave him a fight scene like in Netflix daredevil
John Wick : Hold my beer
Great trailer but anyone else feel it shows way too many kills?
I can't wait to watch it.
Micheal Myers don't die again from the fire of the house in Haddonfield Illinois..Micheal Myers will  kill  more all of the people to DEAD!  He will coming back Halloween Kills for Haddonfield Illinois...If Micheal Myers go to HELL!....He never die himself. The people will be  Hurts and Blood to DEATH of Haddonfield Illinois.....Stay out of Micheal Myers in Haddonfield.
I want a Michael vs Jason movie
this shit is awesome!!!!!
Love the Halloween 3 reference
c h i l l s
Mike just typed in godmode and has been abusing his admin privileges at this point
This Avengers Assemble On Halloween.
Alright this man Michael Myers is not even human anymore after all these years  and seasons and movies this n**** has still survived every time
Amaizing
The Halloween is back😓😬😬
Who else is excited for this?!
They show in the trailer but do not point out that grown Tommy Dole, M A Hall, and Lindsey are back for the good fight. These movies are so catnip for me. Saw the original on its first release. Scary as F. The whole audience screamed.
Ptm ya matenlo
Hey guys, might've given away too much in this one. Thanks for reassuring us that this Halloween sequel will be as much filler as possible until it finally "ends" in the next.
Good
Jason Vs Michael Myers would be awesome.
I wasn’t impressed by the previous _Halloween_ film’s plot but loved the brutality of the kills I hope this movie will have both a good story and brutal kills
Looks like they spoiled all the kills
Goosemumps 😂
SEASON OF THE WITCH REFERENCE I LOVE IT!!!
👌👌
👍👍
Can't wait 😁
Ohhh yesss 👌
How many times does she say "evil dies tonight"? Every movie that's what. At this point it's useless
Not gonna lie, this looks fucking epic
Michael 🎃🎃😱😱😱
It ruined the suspense by this trailer. It spoiled so much by showing too many people's deaths.
Damn they have milked this s*it. At this point he should be dying of old age. They haven't killed him on over 30 years.
This seems like an ending but they’ve announced a sequel to this already
Way to ruin the movie smfh -_-
Yessss !!!! He is coming back this October 😊
Why aren't they finishing the season....IDK its getting bore day by day....no end to the Villian....no face of the Villian....he is roaming freely, no police, no guns, no bombs or tanks....how can nobody is able to stop him...now making no sense
Always go to horror movie night before Halloween, will certainly be this one this year.
Nd the fact Jamie Lee Curtis is still playin the role since day one, that’s 🔥. Dedicated ass actress.
BROOOOOOO👍👌👍👌💯💯👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Nice season of the witch "easter egg" but this feels so far like a remake if halloween 2. We'll see
Lorrie is more dangerous than Michael .
This one better be better than the last one, the last Halloween was garbage
He just never dies doesnt he?
Micheal mans goin to Jason territory this time around
Rob Zombie ain helpin?? 🤔
Oh yeah
That time of the year 🎃
What an absolute gut-wrenching, fear-inducing sharp-edged trailer!
Yea this man never dies
Going back to the Halloween well again? Hollywood is out of ideas.
Halloween about to be lit 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wait is he serial killer or super power evil being?
So effin lame. I hate how they try so hard to have a hero in a serial killers film. So stupid how they take his mask off and gang up on him. Also how the hell is that chick stronger than michael?
NO LIVES MATTER to Mikey!🤣😅😅🤣😅🤣😅
KinoCheck and IGN free property 😅😁😆
ofc he survived
Did you saw the report the high level Chinese defector Dong Jingwei said? Most of our government is with Chinese agents. 1/3 of Chinese exchange students are actually intelligence agents for the CCP amongst other explosive comments. Your country is being attacked and you don't even care.
Yess!!!! Finally he's back
Michael never die like the franchise
They turned Michael Myers legacy into Jason...shame on them. This trailer is Friday the 13th movie not a Halloween movie. The last one was trash n it didn't make sense if you were a true Halloween fan so now try to confuse us?
*Schpookeh*
Covid kills not Halloween.
Looks fun. We already know he doesn’t die, because 2022 they release *Halloween Ends*
Ha ha Got yo mask
Oh yeah!!!😍😍😍😍😍😍😆😆😆😆I’m so ready!!!
I love this series because of citizen z
Hope @Dead Meat does a kill count on this. I know he will
Holy shit
hOLY sHIT! I CAN NOT WAIT
F**KEN LOVE JAMIE LEE CURTIS.
DO SOMETHING ORIGINAL FOR FUCKS SAKE
Dead by daylight new update  Hunter - 3 human Survivor - Michael Myers
Hey can trailers not spoil the entire movie, this movie looks dope but now I know the whole plot broski.
Seems like just a bunch of cheap kills rather than an interesting story.
God level killing shit\=+
lol so this is like Michael vs the towns angry parents?
Omg... I am waiting because of citizens Z
I wanted Conal Cochran to have another movie. 😞
Honestly it looks like a heaping hot pile of dog sh%t you fanboys/girls will watch anything i swear lol
He murdered like 8 ppl in the trailer lol jesus he must plaster 20 plus
The fire-fighters really did save the man on accident🤣🤣
FINALLY, the REAL trailer! 🤣
He is back
Michael Myers killed more people than covid in the trailer alone
they never kill this sucker
Holy fuck this is sick.
You have just seen the entire movie
Excited
I love the Halloween series but they’re truly milking this shit.
Do it.. DO IT. MICHAEL: well okay, since you asked nicely 😏🔪
Can't wait for this movie
0:45 bonesaw is ready!
Poor firefighters. R.I.P
The hype from this trailer is absolutely real! I’m excited to see this!
Watch in 20 years when he kills people while sitting in a wheelchair
Cant wait to watch ive been waiting
Laurie:This Ends Tonight  Michael: Surprise I'm Back
Bullets anybody?
"Mike Myers is alive." In a movie from Universal which now owns Shrek
dis is bouttttaaaaaa be litttttttt
More like "halloween blows." Am I right. Lol
Damn another tier 1 NOED Myers
This Sequel 🔥
*Michael Myers has some many timelines that I’m sure he’s a wanted time variant but the TVA is just too scared to intervene*
They gave away a little too much in this trailer.  I'll still watch it though.
so he's jason now. cool.
This gonna be good
Michael vs Jason. Have some people go to camp crystal lake on Halloween.
HOW JUST HOW!! i dont know the whole story so correct me if im wrong how is an old man able to overpower all those people and survive for that long in the fire like wtf
"Mike Myers is alive" - The cop
Well I definitely watch in theaters...
I just saw the whole goddam movie
Karen: "Michael, didn't you hear? They lifted the mask mandate. Lemme help you outta that"
I dunno. Feel like theyre falling victim to the sequel ideology that it must be more of everything.
This trailer just ruined the beginning of the movie.
*Michael is alive again*   Me: shocked pikachu face :0
For once I am internally fangirl screaming 🤩🤩🤩
Looks like the William Shatner mask slapped up those Silver Shamrock masks real good. 😂🔪💀🎃🧙
Bad Ass 🐲🔥🔥🔥
Am I the only one hoping for Michael to win? For some reason I cant stand Laurie, her daughter, or her grand daughter.
EHH
Only one other killer can take down Michael Myers.  Jason Voorhees.
I wonder why the original actor that played tommy in 78 isnt playing his own character
I think Jason looked Great!
thanks for 99.9% of the movie
Jason: "I have the most kills ever in horror movies" Michael: "Hold my butcher knife"
The fire truck people never come that fast and they had that house far away and no fire alarm so how the heck did they know the fire was there? That was a easy cop out of how he survived.
At this point Michael Myers isn’t Human if there’s a sequel to this one let’s give him a rocket pack
Lawd have mercy 👀👀👀 Michael is on a killing spree this go round. 😲😲
wow HIM&FREEDY KRUGER.ESSENCE OF EVIL
Michael has been killing since the 70’s. You’re Fucked 🤷🏾‍♂️
He's on a rampage
The movie looks okay but, it's like most movies coming out nowadays have a lot of the best scenes in the trailer. Ruins the shock factor when you finally see it in the theater.
WILL...........I GUESS MICHAELS  BACK.......SO, THAT'S A THING. (Looking through planner) MMMMMMMM, What to do, what to do ........mmmmmm, Dune, batman and matrix 4. Nick cage has a film coming out. SORRY I'M BOOKED. Good luck Jamie lee.
okay if he don't die in this movie imma have to talk to the directors or something
Me-Watches the trailer at night My brain-What if Me-No
The opening sequence of this movie is gonna be one of the most thrilling killing sprees in cinema
and then we wake up its fuckin october... were sniffing 2021...
Looks decent. Best part about this trailer was the music, love the way they did it.
Another trailer which almost tells the whole story.
Michael will never die
YESSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Just give away the whole movie why dnt you smh 🤦‍♀️
Wow they really put the whole movie on the trailer
https://youtu.be/ApFUw-Gzw7c
Here we go again😑come on guys make something new🤨
If Laurie Strode dies istg I will be highly pissed😭😭 she’s been here so long and I’ll be rly upset but it seems like a great movie🥰
can't wait to see this one soon
This looks horrifyingly excellent😈💯
Nobody gonna call the national guard to wipe out this guy after what he just did to  the first responders.
The only thing thats gonna kill Michael at this point is his age
I liked the Halloween 3 reference.
he  gives jason's vibes
COVID19 killed Michael.  You’re welcome!
how many more of these will they make
Oh hell yeah so awkward and horror.
They aren’t gonna kill him, because there is a movie coming out called Halloween ends
,
hehe
Looks good. Only thing that worries me is how little Tommy and Lindsay are in it. They better not get killed.
I’m wondering if Micheal Myers will be making a cameo in the Forever purge so that way we can have a Myers Purge crossover. THAT WOULS BE SICK!!!
Good thing I watched the movie already thanks to the trailer saved me 2hrs.
Yes.
Love the Halloween 3 reference
This trailer is showing too much of the movie geeeesh
I love Halloween from Thai😱😱
No it's a lazy last minute thing because they ran out of ideas and didn't wanna take the time to do a new concept
NICE.....
Lol why do trailers show almost the whole movie.
1:41  CHILLLSSS
I can already hear the host and editor of dead meat(kill count) having a breakdown after this movie is released
He's going to his childhood home?? Please not that again.
Damn and I thought michael couldn't get any hotter ( no homo)
Thank to release the movie in the short version
this is laughable.
I like the fact that it’s like a whole community against Michael
"He's flesh and blood"  Has been shot at multiple times, left in a burning house, countless other shit and has been reincarnated / not been killed many times over  Me: .. ya
I really think it's always another person
Omg !!!
Enough of this shit
Shamrock masks, which had a paranormal twist. This has those masks, and is said "the more he kills the more he ascends". So hopefully this is similar to the curse of thorne, be more like he is THE boogeyman
So I guess we're just going to forget when she decapitated him??? 🤔🤔 They gonna milk this shit to infinity!!! 💪
Cummon its time to stop, at a certain point its too many too often we get it….he doesn’t DIE. BUT AT SOME POINT HE JUST HAS TO ✨✨✨✨DIE✨✨✨✨
https://youtu.be/FmUayhQUf-4
Looks sick
Looks like total dog shit
I f*cking told my friends that he literally survived through the gun cabinet in the basement like after we watched the movie 3 years ago and nobody believed me. This trailer just proved everyone, including my friends, who thought otherwise. Because the first person he kills is the firefighter we see fall through the floor (which we see later in the trailer) and he is shown to be in the gun cabinet and then kills the firefighter with his own breach axe.
I'm hyped but I feel like they revealed a bit too much in the trailer
The more he dies the more he gets stronger that aint no human thats a demon.
What a film to look forward to come October looks awesome PJ🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃👍👍👍👍
👍🏻
Huh. And We thought this series was over! Apparently we were wrong!
IM HYPED AF
The trailer showed the whole movie
So the whole town can't stop one man 🤣
Oh, so now Michael is gaining immortal strength with every kill. Is that really what you're going with? Did Chris Terrio write this?
Chris Tucker: “This mother****** just wont die. Die dammit die!!!”
I had severe goosebumps the entire trailer!
James A Janisse is gonna have his work cut out for him
I enjoy the fact that the last Halloween and now this one, Laurie gives off the vibe of the Doomslayer in which she has nothing but murder on her mind. It's badass.
This looks really good
I'm gonna watch it, but suspension of disbelief officially gone. 5+ firefighters (low number of firefighters for the 2 trucks they showed on screen) walk directly into a murder machine one after the other? Also, Michael kills 2 firefighters and survives several minutes of a house fire and comes out with no damage to his very flammable mask and with a clean jump suit despite the night he just spent on a murder spree and said fire. Also also, his fingers were blown off and he got shot in the face in the last movie, and he's over 50?? Final also, a small police department could spend 10 minutes and overwhelm him with force to arrest or kill him  #cinemasins
Anybody who caught in this trailer how he survived the inferno at the end of the 2018 movie speak up! I'm kinda curious how many of you caught that....
Should've just let me burn😈
Finally! Michael versus a mob!
This movie will be the end of Michael…. For now
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17-For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
I  came here after citizen z told me about trailer breakdown❤❤😍
“One shutters to imagine what inhuman thoughts lie behind that mask”   -Spy TF2
" Welcome to the kill count, where we tally up the victims in all out favorite horror movies. " I can hear it already.
Love the masks from Halloween 3
Ima watch it because its Halloween nd im a fan of the Halloween franchise!! But this some bullshit 😒😒 yall need to learn when to fucking stop!! Nd yall show wayy too much in these trailers smh 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
I am so ready for this movie. In the month of October when the movie comes out, I am going to purchase the Michael Myers Mask, go to the movie theater and watch it without taking off the mask. #HALLOWEENKILLS #HALLOWEEN #MICHAELMYERS #JAMIELEECURTIS
Seems like they gave a ton away in the trailer.  Also got the Halloween 4 vibes with the town being pissed off.
Oh my gosh, YES! Give it to me now! This looks like it might be even better than the last one.
I’ll love to see Michael vs Jason before I die
Damn why does it have to release this year? I really want to go to it but...Covid is still a thing :/
Finally not a demon movie 😃
He's like a walking Covid-19. Lmao.
Now we need new jason movies to be made like this but hes not getting no love as these years go by smh...soo sad..
Can’t wait
Rubbish!  Just like what FF is heading
Dude wtf was this trailer Universal??? You showed just about everything... 2:30 felt long and even I was surprised how much you guys were showing. Marketing guys come on now you could've had the same feel for less
i wasnt a fan of the previous movie, hoping this will deliver more for me. looks better at first glance.
Another one?
movie looks shit trust me being a firemen those flames would melt his mask to his face and kill him also 10 angry firemen would beat the shit out of Michael just saying
The Marvel Superhero Ghost Rider should be in the new Halloween Michael Myers movie where Ghost Rider can kill Michael Myers and all the innocent people can have peaceful lives without having nightmares
Looks like a good movie
I’m so excited for this!!! Who agrees with me?
After watching this I thought he was in my room
Everyone- *RUN, MICHAEL HAS REACHED TIER 3!*
Damn they really like givin away everything in the trailers
Круто!!! Скорее бы увидеть!!!👍😘👍😉
looks like shit, I am sure the pre-teens love it
HOLY SHIT!!!!! MICHAEL OFFICIALLY HAVE MORE KILLS THAN JASON AND IS OFFICIALLY MORE LEGENDARY AND FAMOUS THAN JASON AND LEATHERFACE. AND THIS IS ONLY PART 2. THIS IS INTENSE 🔥
They showed too much in this trailer!!!! We just need a teaser. It feels like I just watched the entire movie
Yes. I'm ready for this 🙂
The nod to Halloween 3!  I love it!
DC Lucifer can help to stop Jason
DC Lucifer can help to stop Jason
I absolutely love the violin added to the theme omg gives it such an eerie feel, omg this movie looks goddamn ruthless I friggin love it
*The Halloween 3: Season Of The Witch masks at **1:30** is a nice touch (the ONLY Halloween movie without Michael Myers in it... well, except for the commercial for the original Halloween movie playing in the bar scene)*
I'm pretty sure I just seen the whole plot and movie in this one trailer. Why do movie company's think this is good marketing... I'm literally going to wait till it comes out on blue ray now 🤷🏻‍♂️ fuck your box office numbers.
I’m gonna 💩 as another person dies 🔪🎃
Who else is here after citizen z video 🤩
this is supposed to be a fucking trilogy isn't it....
https://youtu.be/-RAglyw6ySk
I can already imagine the kill count in this movie geez it’s going to be massive
I knew they would get tired of his ass sooner than later....🤣😂
I felt like they gave a little too much away in this trailer. They should’ve kept more secret to create more suspense.
Thanks seen the whole movie now can’t wait for the next lol
I can't believe I am saying this.... but I actually want to see this!  Holy Hell
1 day this drop and already has 1.1 mil views
LOOKS AMAZING 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍
I’m a huge Michael Myers fan I can’t wait till October.
2:02 Did I hear “Yibambe?”
whyyy? BUT WHYYY??? IT HAD LITERALLY THE BEST ENDING TO A TERROR SAGA! WHY FUCKING HOLLYWOOD????!
🗑 🗑 🗑
They are going against a tier 6 p3 michael main
Can we please see a Jason vs Michael movie
this man can’t die
Firefighter:take my hand         Michael:I got you dawg
Thanks for all the spoilers… fuckers
You know what else is launching this Halloween? The James Webb Space Telescope. I am so nervous for that that I'll watch this move just to calm my nerves over it.
I wish Dr.Loomis from the 1st Halloween was still around. Tell the sheriff I shot him tell him hes still on the loose! Random guy standing outside of his house: is this some kind of joke I've been trick or treated to death tonight. Dr.Loomis: you don't know what death is! Lmao
The hype is *scary*
This one looks fucking great!
Wow!
If any famous act be in this movie they will die in bloodest way no mader how much they famouse are
I love how John carpenter still gets directory credits even after all these years
Jesus man leave something for the fucking movie! This showed WAY TOO MUCH
Trailer just showed us most of the film. Lol
If she doesn’t stop him in this movie, I’m going to have to step in.
I'm going to pretend that I didn't see this trailer. The ending for Michael Myers was just in 2018...
Who knows, Laurie in the hospital could be a reference to Halloween 2. Also, love the way they addded the Silver Shamrock masks
Jamie Lee Curtis is the real OG!! I can never get enough of her! She embodies Halloween!!!!
Kills and Ends are going to be epic in my opinion
Lol ...
https://youtu.be/YCwTRdBIyV8
O bixo é o Lazaro, ninguém pega essa disgraca!!
Why do I feel bad for the firefighters?
Why not bait him into a trap
Wow....
I just watched the whole movie
Someone needs to make a parody of the scene where she steals his mask  where Michael says in a whiny toddler voice "nooooooooooo gibbit"
From memory, they just sorta hash over the embodiment of evil in all the old movies, but now they’re like “yea, this cunt ain’t human, he some demon bitch”
Damn he snapped lol cant wait 🎃🔨🪚🪓
Looks like bullshit
Myers in mk11
That mf in tier 3 😂 just infinite so he doesn’t get bloodlust 💯💯💯
Buset makin OP aja ini michael myers
Um...so either they literally showed us every death in the movie, or this is gonna be more brutal than the original reboot...  May have to leave the wife home to see this in theaters 😳😳😳
A other movie from this foo haha
WHOA! This looks EPIC! Love this whole series, well except the stupid one about the "masks", but I digress...
He's not a man. He's not flesh and blood. Stab him, shoot him, even take his head off, blow him up, doesn't matter. He'll keep coming back no matter what ya do. You can't kill evil, you can only try to survive it and keep it at bay. That's a fact. Just like Freddy and Jason you can't kull them, you can't stop them because they won't stop.  You should know all that by now Laurie haven't you been paying attention? This is no mortal man and evil does not die. I always comes back.
Damn!!!!  That was good!!  Looks like they might fool us all and Allison dies instead of Laurie or Karen.  This looks terrifying and intense.  I think the final film will be something very different and unexpected.  This is scary as hell!!
I know it's going to be like this. Why do you burn the house down?
Now this is what I call a sequel 😈💯
Word
#WarnerBrosForever #ForAutumnSnyder #ZackSnyderJusticeLeague
Wow, there's a LOT going on here, and I don’t mean that in a good way. I hope this isn’t another case of trading in suspense for a high body count.  Having Michael pop out and stab people--like in the 2018 film--is lazy and uninteresting. Great slasher movies require generous amounts of stalking, buildup, and suspense. Once the actual attack comes, your wad is shot.
Michael Myers killed in brutal fashion with some fingers missing(think about that). That's insane.
There is three solutions if you want to survive : 1. Don't buy expensive shit go fly somewhere else  2.call the goddam army  3.just do number 1
I wish some of the Haddonfield residents trained jiu-jitsu so when Myers tries to strangle them, they put him in an armbar.
Michael myers is definitely not human anymore!!!
Fuckin A
yes!!!
I haven’t really watched the movies but this is pathetic. It’s gotten way out of hand. It’s just a man, it’s not like he has superpowers, why doesn’t he just die already…
Evil NEVER dies mfs!!! good luck hehehe 🎃🔪
I dont think anybody understands how excited I am for this
Movie of the Year! 🎃🔪🔥
he is no man but a beast sent by satan himself to plunge the world into a total chaos he is the boogeyman.
I can’t wait 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This man is 65 years old walking around like he in his mid 20s
More and more trash... no matter what a third one is coming out so this one is pointless
REALLY ?! STILL ?
This movie was in hindi hope second part also may come in Hindi ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Looks much more engaging and interesting than the first one of this new trilogy. I like the Silver Shamrock masks Easter egg, very cool.
OMGGGGGGGG FINALLY 😩 YES IM SO EXITED
Jamie lee curtis is gonna do these halloween movies until she's a great grandma
Halloween 3 Callback with the masks?
Jamie Lee Curtis is an ICON.   Anything less will be considered an insult
I won't be surprised when I turn 80 years old that this franchise will still keep going
Hasn't he lost an arm or a hand at the end of the last movie?
Cant fucking wait ! GO GO GO !
“Evil dies Tonight.” 2074 Halloween: the revival
joder no puedo esperar 🥵
1:32 Season of the witch!
Scary 😐
I wanna see this
Well, thanks for spoiling the entire movie with this trailer. I’m still excited and, of course, am going to watch it, but instead of being surprised by the kills, I will be instead be waiting for the kills. So instead of, “Oh, man! I hope she makes it!” I will be thinking, “Here comes the fluorescent lightbulb that’ll kill her!” It's not the same punch, but trailers these days need to spoil the movie.
I bet there is at least 5 more, each one worse than the next. People stopped caring after the last one.
😴
Preguntar cuándo se estrena una película de Halloween es lo más pedorro que ví en mi vida...😂😂😂
I literally just watched the rob zombie Halloween 2 for the 1st time last night now they're making another Halloween 2 for the recent one that just came out.
NO WAY ! ! ! ...im THERE !
ITS DA SPOOKY MONTH
Looks better than the last one
A whole town after Michael is one of his biggest wet dream ever lol dude is about to have fun
Can we appreciate the firefighter that got chopped in the throat but his visor broke?
They showed way to much in this trailer in my opinion
These time movies are getting better and better
What LVP wanted to do to Kyle but couldn’t 2:01
The thing that makes me mad is. If you see someone get grabbed by the infamous town murderer, why you sit there and scream? Bro I'm outrunning Hussain Bolt if I see that mask.
This nigga a real life gta character 😂😂
People can think they’re tough and indomitable, but when faced with an unstoppable force, most people show themselves for the genetic mistakes they truly are.
Just loop him lol
James A Jannise will start his kill count strong
4 FUCKING MONTHS  🔪 🔪 🎃
That new theme sounds filthy!! 🎃🔪🩸
Would of been cool if he just killed the 2 fireguys then walked out the back and his boys are wondering what happened to them
Can't Wait!
"The more he kills, the more he transcends.” Now that’s some BS tbh.
This movie seems be the best film of halloween
the trailer itself is scary. this is bout to be the best sequel in movie sequel history. i hope i wont be disappointed
待ってました！！！！！！
brutal
So...just put the whole movie in the trailer?
More of the same shit. I'm out.
The night he stayed home
This showed waaaaaaaay too much but I’m still stoked for it.
I would've ran so hard in that opening scene
It would be nice if one of these series would genuinely wrap up. i mean i love horror movies but it gets kind of boring reboot and remake after reboot and remake. just put old faithful to rest with one hell of a final film.
Can't wait! Looks great! Doesn't look like Michael is f'ing around!
I wore a Michael Myers mask and jumpsuit to my 8th grade costume contest....and won.   Other kids had really nice face paint and hand made costumes. I won based on fear alone. People didn't know it was me and I played it off. Didn't say a word the whole day.
Yesss they used the same mask finally a movie producer with brains
Well, I guess I don't have to watch the movie! The trailer showed everything important!
Some people may say the trailer showed the whole movie and as of watching it, I thought so too, but rethinking it over now, I know these producers put their effort and hard work into this because you can really tell it's their passion and because of that, I don't think they would want their work being spoiled entirely for all us excited fans. Which makes me 10x more excited because if my theory is correct, this is only a fraction of the intense awesomeness this film has in store.
Can’t kill the boogeyman 🔥🎃😎
This is hands down my favorite Scary Movie. I'm ready. Jamie Lee brings excitement to these Movies 🎥
😲👍
U knw what his motive     "Nothing "
Man, just call a dang cluster strike on his location.
I hope Michael lays waste to everyone.
*when killing a franchise isnt enough*
1:32 halloween season of the witch
Jason looks angry in this movie.
Rob Zombie.   It ended there.  Yet we have another one...
Why does Jamie Lee Curtis nearly yell every line? It's like, I'm angrier now.... rrrrr. Otherwise it's looks cool
They are burdened with glorious purpose
So. Damn. Excited.   🧡🎃🖤
One thing that annoyed me with the last movie is that you didn't see many of the kills. He would kill someone then the camera would turn away. Then later on in a scene you would see the body pinned against a wall or hidden in another scene
Didn’t Dead Meat already do this? Whatever
This will be more bloody and gross. And i like. But is this the last movie from Michael myres?
That updated Theme 😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️
The trailer didn't even play the iconic theme song!!! SMH!
Damn can’t wait
micheal killing the fire fighters is actually a really good touch
HOLYSH*T IM SO HYPEEEEEE FOR HALLOWEEN NOW!!!
I’ve noticed the 2 people dressed as nurses…I believe they were the same people dressed as nurses in the 2018 Halloween sometime after Michael kills the old woman in her home with a hammer n n bumps into the kids n right b4 he walks into the 2nd lady’s home n stabs her thru the neck…maybe not I think they were in a different car in the 2018 film..I think I gotta watch again
I’m ready 🎃
OMG! This is AWESOME!
1:32 I dig the reference to Halloween 3
I wish the trailer would have left Michael strolling out onto the porch in that slow-mo and putting the fear of god into the firemen and then cut away.   Showing him wreck them was almost too much of a giveaway.  I suppose that can be said for most the trailer, but that porch scene is just awesome
Dreams of being a firefighter ended with this trailer YIKES 😬
God I hope the douche bag boyfriend of the granddaughter would’ve got killed in the other one. Good to see it looks like he won’t this time.
I was wondering when the town was going to stop being afraid and just start hunting him.
This trailer gave away the entire movie
aaaaaw yeah... bring the stupid! Enough with these "classy" Halloween attempts, make it big and stupid - that's what we want
I assume be 2 more movies and then it be over
The man walks faster than they can run and still seems to avoid the whole town for a while🤣🤣🤣
It's been done a million times, but it looks good
Well damn……  Michael is killing it !!!!!
im confused🤔
This seems to imply some supernatural power behind Michael. I hope not. That didn't turn out well for the franchise the first time. Keep him human. Makes it much better.
Michael bouta surpass John Wick’s kill count lol
Kinda sad out of everyone to escape safeley dam kid hew just said fuck this shit im out ran off lol
I won't watch this one because Curtis has been a pain in real life so I hope Michael finally gets her.
0:30 it’s like Michael has walked out of the fiery pits of hell not even the devil could stop because he is one
Michael Myers vs Everybody
Haddonfield should get a mob together and try piling on him and repeatedly kick, stomp and bludgeon him till he's mush. Problem solved
Man that shit was brutal that was more intense than Rob Zombie
That scene in the kitchen man , gssssss
If she doesn’t kill em this time. Imma have to step in…
Meh!
Kinda clèish
*Halloween 3: We About Done With Yo Shit, Michael*
Dead by daylight fans anyone?
Even Kane fears Myers.
Halloween ends: micheal fucking kills thanos and wipes out half the universe.
The last was complete trash and this one seems to be continuing in that direction. Nice
It's fascinating how this is the 12th film in a franchise that started out with such a simple story (Guy in mask stalks babysitters). It goes to show that oftentimes how well a movie is made can take precedence over substance. This movie looks like the antithesis of the original in almost every way: gory, action-packed, loud, special-effects driven, self-aware, excessive, unsubtle, and probably very 'woke'. Needless, to say, I'm excited.
I know there are people that think the trailer showed to much, but I have a feeling we haven’t seen nothing yet. This movie is going to be brutal, intense and even traumatic! From what I’ve seen, this movie is going to give me everything I want and more! CAN’T WAIT!!!!
Pretty positive this trailer showed the whole movie
Corniest dialogue I’ve heard in a movie in a long time. This is gonna suck even worse than the first one.
Man Michael Myers will never die.
Uuhh.. was that Anthony Michael Hall 👀
Halloween 3 is Canon now lol.
😍😍 omg this looks amazing! Can’t wait!
I bet a lot of people are going to be posting all these comments on the old Halloween 3 Season of the Witch trailer, of how this video brought them there.
i miss the time these movies were actually creepy. i'll still watch it but it looks like a friday the 13th part 65 type movie
Wow 👍
So hate to be that guy but I already see some familiar faces. The doctor and nurse we saw in 2018 are those people on the merry go round. The clothes match
I'm so excited for this movie
I'm gonna guess the kill count is going to be around 20-25.  Trailer: We already show you what's Michael Myers kill count in this movie.
I hope Ben Tramer makes an appearance. He is alive since Halloween 2 never happened
He’s still invincible, has super strength, but he’s not related to Laurie, so it’s more grounded and realistic than the original sequels….. 🤣
I know this is pointless but, CAN ANYTHING KILL MICHAEL MYRES?!?!!?!!???
He was really good in Shrek
Feels weird watching a killer known primarily for stalking and stealthily murdering people get into an all out weapons fight with an entire squad of firefighters. Ion like it🤨
It looks better than the last one.🤷🏻‍♂️
This trailer proves that Michael can take on the whole world
Were those the Silver Shamrock masks?
That fireman who tried to face Michael with the Buzzsaw is a Legend
Wait cause this trailer is so good I can’t wait for this movie
Almost 3 months
OHMYGOOOOOOOOD
The last one didn’t scare me…this one could bring back those nightmares of my childhood
I really hope the nasty ex boyfriend  gets💀💀💀
the end part of the trailer where she grabbed the mask if I was her i would be so confident about winning this fight sense there’s tons of people I would start ripping his mask in half xD
Michael Myers seems a little overpowered
It's been over a year and a half since I've been excited for anything. All it took 2mins and 30 seconds to bring back ALL THE FEELS!!!! THANK-YOU!
IM FUCKING HYPED!!!!$$
Annnnnnd he’s still gonan be alive by the end of this one too
Michael putting up a higher body count in this trailer than John Wick has had his entire career
Where is busta rhymes lol
there are 13 Halloween movies....enoughs enough
They gave away too much but I will still see it
No need to see the movie just see his trailer
how many of these damn movies can they make smh? wow....it gets ridiculous at some point...
Dead Meat gonna have a hell of a time covering this🤣
So is anyone going to talk about how they took his mask
This time, this movie will be a thriller! Especially when the theme song always gets me pumped! 2021 🔥 🎃
Myers clearly doesn't know how to die.
I LOVE her “LET IT BURN!!!” She puts so much heart into her role.
I'd watch a Michael myers vs the Joker movie
Maybe Laurie will have learned she needs more than a lever action for self defense…
These characters are unbearable. Especially Laurie. I am on Michael's side.
If my man Julian doesn’t return I ain’t watching
I can't wait!
I feel like they showed way to much
Looks perfect!!!
Where´s Julian?? ... #PrayforJulian
Holy S**** this looks like the greatest movie ever made!!
Lets show all the kills guys... all of em.... you fuckin idiots
He killed like 10 people and this only the trailer
I really don’t get it  ....how does this fucker still live,HES NOT JASON!!
Michael Myers is the greatest horror character of all time. No words, no facial expressions, no remorse, no emotions, just pure unadulterated evil.
I'm coming for you Michael 😈wow I'm so excited
How is Michael "powering-up" every time he kills someone any more grounded in reality or less stupid than Laurie being his sister?
Fkn hell... he is UNKILLABLE
These movies just keep getting better, and more than make up for the terrible films that came after Halloween 4
Bruh why this look lowkey good
yes yes yes
I wouldn’t be surprised if they did a cross promotion with Fortnite
I liked Halloween (again, again). This feels unnecessary.
Thumbs down only because I hate it when trailers show WAAAAY too much. THEY KNOW that fans of the Halloween movies are going to see this regardless of whether they even gave this movie a trailer or not, so there is NO REASON to give away so much in the trailer. Save the kills and the MAJOR PLOT POINTS for the Theatergoers. *Sometimes Less is More*
Most definitely the biggest fan of Halloween franchise (apart from three). Can't wait for this one. So please  dont disappoint me. So excited anf bringing some of the original cast in. Genius 🔪🔪⚰⚰⚱⚱
Awesome,  but they'll never kill him lol
Oh lawd ahhhhh
Well since most likely they want to kill him, I hope he takes out as many!
The Halloween III masks were excellent! Love this trailer.
Ok he killed like 30 people in this trailer how many people does he kill in this movie lol
Impressive. Jamie Lee Curtis kicks ass!
Interesting to think, the firefighters falls through the ground because of Lauri shooting those random shots into the ceiling.. that made no sense why she did that until now
Ok miss Kyle Richards with some good acting!!!!!!
Yes!!!
If they want Michael dead why don't they just bring back Busta Rhymes characters? Michael would be good as dead.
If Halloween was an anime plot armor would mean nothing for Michael
After this is Halloween Ends.  If COVID had never happened we would all be waiting for Halloween Ends right now and all would have seen Halloween Kills
If Michael Myers ran westboro baptist church, gays and soldiers would be just fine.
The brutality of the kills is something else
3000 years from now he still lives
I swear Michael ain’t no human. He’s like Pennywise just 1000x more brutalllll
1:50 - 1:59 So you tellin’ you deduced ALLAT ... But y’all regular people just gonna try this mess AGAIN without some supernatural aid? Wtf Sis🙃😂  Cuz y’all been sayin’ this since the ‘70’s🐸☕️. Say it with me sis, “I... am an orbiter”😂😂
Yesssss IT is dope! Can't Wait for IT to come to theaters... In the next film he will hunt down non-vaccinated people.
What’s the crowd chanting?
Will look forward!!!!!!!
I have a feeling the F&F familia will take him down... still on Universal Studio
Wow this looks like actually interesting
Laurie is more likely to die from Oscar Meyer diet health issues than Michael Myers. I can spell bologna, it’s H A L L O W E E N....
1:33 *Nice those are the masks from Halloween 3*
*I love how they made Michael be "saved" by the firefighters instead of reviving him with some magic like in other horror movies*
so many spoilers ...
Another one? They will keep trying but not one sequel or prequel has ever matched the original.
How can he not die?🤣
Wanna survive Michael Myers? Just scream, I’m your sister. You’ll be fine.
Evil dies tonight.... said the 90 year old woman evils been trying to kill.....
❤️
Honestly these Halloween movies are getting tired and boring same old stuff and the actors are over dramatic with the screaming it's annoying do it!! lol
Well, now they spoiled all the kills.
Oh my god another one
Nice Halloween 3 mask reference. 👍
Working a 15 hour shift and you come across this, turbo charges the last 3 hours, I’m pumped for this can wait til October 😂😂😎
This'll prolly be good but id rather see another Rob Zombie version
LETS GOOOOOOOOO
Halloween 72. Michaels eats Chinese food.
Oh shit he's being hunted now ....
OMG ! can't wait for this
This looks awesome!!!! 👍👍
You need popcorn to watch the trailer❤️
I have hope but I don’t thing it’s gonna be as tight and together as 2018
How does this trailer only have 1 million views by now ....
Michael Myers is alive.
How is it we’ve been consistently getting new Halloween films, but not Friday The 13th? I understand there is a court battle going on, but it’s been over a decade.
This is a movie that I cannot wait to see! They really are going all guns out with this one. I can't wait for this and Halloween Ends. Now I 've got to get the 2018 Halloween just to get caught up..
I wonder how this one will end.
I hate how they show all the kills, like save one for when we actually go see the movie lol
Dude can’t kill the same woman over what? 20 years? What’s scary? The flu will take out his victim faster than this guy. He’s needs proper motivation...... like mother....... chi chi chi chi ha ha ha ha.....
โหดมากแต่ละฉาก..😲
Ok we can all agree this one is better then the other one they made
Yes my bithday
Oh piss off with these
HELL YEAH
He can't die. 🎃
Why are they releasing white ass movies then no one watches them and they make no money
Mike fucked up those fire fighters!
Idc what you say I love this and I always will fricken amazing
I have chills right now. I can’t fucking wait to see this movie on the big screen.
Ah crap here we go again!!!
Question. Does this Micheal guy take a break to eat and drink water, do a number 1 and 2 at all because this guy is forever moving without breaking any sweat.
Imagine if Michael does get get killed at the end of this. That would bring uncertainty to Halloween Ends.
They should  have Michael, Jason, Freddy, chucky and the rest. All in one big movie. That’ll be litt!!!!!!
Awesome! We were able to watch the entire movie, except the ending in less than 3 minutes. C'mon Redbox!
Yes sir hess backk!!!
Looks even more dreadful than the last Halloween.  Literally walked out on the last movie. How do these terrible movies get made??? They ruined this franchise a long time ago.
1:06 he took inspiration from Mr. X
My nigga Mikey Myers
I love how he just wrecks the firefighters
Jesus this trailer ruined so many potential good kills smh....
Rob Zombies versions are the best of them all .
Let's normalize having a brother that just won't die no matter how many times you kill him.
0:29, Michael Myers walking out of Hell with instruction from the Devil himself...Kill as many as you want, you shall transcend!!!
Michael Myers vs  the cartel ….. who’s ya pick ?
God sent Michael Myers to cleanse the world of sin ….. that means you …
Micheal looks badass coming out of that house on fire.... killing the firemen like that was a visual
All I ask is that Judy Greer survives. I love her
*we don't need another trailer after this*
1978: Michael kills five people. 2018/2021: "I'm wiping out this entire town."
Looks pretty awesome! Seems like the most bloody Halloween film.
Ik the Michael mires yesssss
Only thing is..they better have way more kills because I feel like we saw every kill in the damn movie almost
HOLY SHIT
This looks AWESOME
Team Michael , My boy Michael don’t take L’s, we make W’s \/\/
Anthony Michael Hall 1:39 and 2:23!!
It pisses me off that they show a lot of the killings of Michael in this trailer it just takes away my excitement of the film, just conceals those scenes so that it makes more people hype about the upcoming film.
POGGERS
The fast and furious of slasher movies
Who noticed those masks from Halloween 3 😨?
This actually looks so fucking good...love the continuity ....looks like alot of action and suspense ...take my money
When you tried to cook a mf uh, uh... damn uh... ham...  Grammarly: sandwich  Me: SANDWICH   When you tried to cook a ham sandwich: 0:35
What happened to her son and her daughter jamie ????
we need a Micheal Myers vs Jason Vorhees
I aint gon cap when he stepped out and flipped that weapon I lost it
Um dia eu vou fazer uma kill como o Maycon myers
"Evil dies tonight" |X| Doubt
Halloween III: Season of the Witch mask for the win!!!
showed me the whole movie in 2 minutes
Rob Zombie's version IS WAY BETTER
4 minus
I like how everybody with a gun suddenly doesn't know how to use one against a target using ONLY a knife. I realize Myers is more or less more than a mere mortal at this point, but still..  At this point, they should just send John Wick, Doom Slayer, and the Equalizer to deal with him..
1:25 and 1:43.....HOLY SHIT THAT THEME SOUNDS A LOT MORE SINISTER WITH A CELLO PLAYING IT...WHOA 😲
* Michael Myers is killed *  The: toy jewel XD
Cool
What a trailer I can’t wait to watch it omg that was a trailer 👑
Badass!!!!
Just goddam launch a nuke
Man listen....I can't WAIT!!!!
This is going to be fucking LIT!!! 🔥
Gets notification of new trailer. Sets player at 1080p - goes full screen - turns up volume - puts phone on mute - closes the blinds - let's rock
Let's Get It On!
That fire didn't do shit to the Shape aka the Boogeyman.
Love it . Can't wait to see it .
After this trilogy ends we need a season of the witch series. This would be the perfect coming out of retirement project for legend John Carpenter. Amazing trailer.
Hope this movie kicks ass!
lets gooooooooooooo
Is he immortal
Guess the days of old mike being scary and the bogeyman are gone and the new and improved terminator mike is here to stay. And I thought the last movie was Pathetic enough
Just like in 2018 my abstinence from Facebook begins due to the fact there's a Halloween movie coming out within the next 4 months. I happen to be a huge fan of the Halloween franchise so I'm in all the groups. But these kids get on there and post all day long about every minute minuscule detail that they can find about the movie before it comes out. Every leaked trailer, leaked footage, photographs, every possible scenario of what's going to happen with every character, everything that they've heard. It's like guys I get you're fanboys but don't you want to watch the movie and not know what's going to happen? You guys have seriously got to get a life. The only thing that they have to respond with is "Don't look at it if you don't want to."  Thank you for that tremendous advice. I have no idea why I didn't think of that myself, it's not like it just pops up on my news feed every single post. Fruit baskets. I usually leave all of that alone because we all have something in common but how does every single one of you stand about five feet five, about 70 lb overweight with a huge gut, a huge beard, wear nothing but black t-shirts, and live in your mom's basement. It's absolutely mind-boggling how every single one of you can look exactly the same.
The version of the halloween theme through this trailer is so so badass!
broorororor i can’t WAIT AND MY BDAY IS OCT11 BRO I CANT WAITTTT!!!!!!
A new Halloween movie is never disappointing 🎃
I'm excited. My body is ready!
When she said "LET IT BUUUUUUURN...." I felt that...
Plot twist: Michael has been dead for years and his corpse has been running off rage and muscle memory all these years
Just let this storyline die and start a new one 🤷🏽‍♂️
Love seeing the masks from Halloween III
I hope this ends with everyone’s in town getting their licks in lol. Just snuffin the shit outta mike like the end of death proof.
Literally everyone is a target. "I love your mask" * stab*. "Where's the hospital?" *stab stab*. "You like boku no pico?" *Don't touch my knife weirdo*
Let's GOOOOOOOOOO Michael's back!!!!!!
Man, how do you show so much of a movie in a trailer?
Now this is ah serious that’ll never die
Very...very...good🎃🗡
He's back. Oh hell yeah it's on now.
Nice call back to Holloween 3
1:33 masks from Halloween 3
Won’t that mask be melted to his face
i really hope this one just focusses on the main three women and not other cliche boring teen characters. the moments where it was just laurie and her family vs michael were the best in the last one
I'd say Michael's gonna kill half of the town then by Halloween ends they gonna get in the army to finish him off
the violin cover of theme is magnificent
Lol 😂 shit corny as fuck
Whoever made this trailer just gave away half of the danm kills.
Dead franchise in my book!📚
*Welp that’s basically the whole movie.*
This trailer looks like it included all of Michael's kills...😥
Cool Halloween 3 reference
I like how they don't really explain why he is so evil, hope they keep it that way.  Its much better when the villian kills and kills but no one can understand why, pure evil.
This better be good
Official trails zootopia 2
YUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Can't wait
I hope that laurie and the whole town takes michael out even though he'd probably take out 90 percent of the town-
I can't wait to see this 💙
One word describes this whole trailer: brutal.  In a great way.
Feels like they put the whole movie in this trailer lol
Halloween kills" TE espero Con anciiass & El terroor) De michell 😊🎃🔪
*John Carpenter's Halloween theme intensifies*
This just popped up in my head but in Halloween 1978 didn’t they have a scene or deleted scene showing Michael as a teenager in the mental hospital sitting in a chair looking out the window? And I could’ve sworn the showed Jamie Lee holding a teddy bear watching him…I know I didn’t imagine this I just can’t remember which film they put it in.
$5 says he doesnt die in this one too and they make another after this.
Ok but the violin version of the main song gives it a great tone I love it
So every Time Michael kill someone he gets stronger Anthony Michael is going to have a large   kill Count and it’s so awesome I can’t wait for Halloween kills :)
biden mask is on point :)
If Michael Myers runs in this movie I will be happy
OH COME ON! THEY SHOWED WAYY TOO MUCH IN THIS TRAILER WTF!
you are all delusional. this looks straight up terrible.
Michael Myers is the G.O.A.T.
This nigga does not dieeee😭
“Evil dies tonight”…………. Meanwhile Halloween ends in the making.
This mans about to take out a whole town
*Micheal Myers the Original Hater of a Karen* He knew Karens were bad for society! 😆
Michaels mother: Did you kill them? Michael: Yes Michaels mother: how many? Michael: All of them
Come outside Michael ain't nobody finna jump you
Halloween Kills, complete with anti-mask Karen.
i know i’m not the only one noticing how they put the “halloween 3: season of the witch” masks on the people that died on that “trail to his house...” cool little easter egg
I swear ive watched this trailer like 10 times already.I think this one is going to be brutal and have a very high body count.When Michael walks out of that burning house swinging a pickaxe he's like ''Okay now im really fucking pissed''.
Jamie Lee needs to call Arnold asap !
How is he still alive? 🤔
Thanks for not making us wait til october to see the whole movie!
this is gonna be insane
Ok, I think that you just showed the entire movie.
Jesus is coming back very soon. We must be ready.   1 Corinthians 15:3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:  1 John 5:13  These things have I written unto you that BELIEVE on the name of the Son of God; that ye may KNOW that ye have ETERNAL LIFE, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.
Please tell me Haddonfield has a Bat-Signal. I'm pretty sure Batman is the only person that can stop him at this point. o_o'
I'm rooting for the dude wearing the pajama pants holding the wrench at 2:22.
Michael is probably gonna get a lot more kills in the movie, probably double the amount shown here.
i can't wait I CAN'T WAIT IM EXCITED LOVE HALLOWEEN
Calling it now, Laurie probably dies twords the middle/end.
Well we already know that Michael lives because there’s gonna be another movie after this one.
Darn they revealed too much in trailer.
Looks like Nick Castle at :47
man said "fuck it, get the buzzsaw"!
another one 🔥🔥🔥
LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
My man literally upgrades by killing the innocents and learns new ways of killing people by killing them and keeping notes of it 😂 the taste of retribution fills him with satisfaction
So Michael is going to grind experience points by killing the entire town until he's strong enough to take on the final boss again (Laurie)?
Ma dawg is back!!!! But sheesh they showin tooooo much
1:31 Makes me want to watch Halloween III: Season of the Witch.
To be honest the start was a good way to keep the franchise going
My favorite part of this trailer was the way they played the theme on the violin just beautiful
Michael Myers, the stealthy Halloween killer, finally starts hunting in the open. The town of Haddonfield finally rallies against the killer. The mask finally comes off to reveal the true face of the evil within. Halloween ends.
Kinda beating a dead horse but yeah alright
The Hunter becomes the hunted
Where is national guard in film
Something tells me he will be more angrier and violent than his counterpart in Halloween 6. In that case, I’m all for it.
I watched this like 50 times already
Take my spas 12 shotgun m4 carbine dual m9 Beretta and rpg rocket launcher
Spoiler Alert: I can't believe they killed our beloved Marion Chambers. Her dead body at 1:36 and her death scene at 1:57... I am/was most excited for the return of this character played by Nancy Stephens. Nurse Marion Chambers is such an iconic character in the Halloween franchise.
Finally, it looks like Hollywood is releasing something decent.
I had to thumbs down for #666. Why didn't Michael's mask burn in the fire???
As good as this trailer looks, it kind of sucks knowing that this isn't when Michael Myers actually dies (seeing as we know there's going to be one more Halloween movie i.e. Halloween Ends).
I loved Mike Myers in Austin Powers
At this time and age, they still don't  call 911.
Looks pretty good.
Holy shit it’s gonna be the best one yet can’t wait for the cliff hanger to set up Halloween Ends
Good luck on the kill count James.
halloween kills the boxoffice
🎶"Happy, happy Halloween, Halloween, Halloween . . .Happy, happy Halloween, Silver Shamrock"!🎶 🎃💀 ☘
This is the reason I still love going to the movies. 🎃
Eminem the movie
Bad trailer, so its probably a good movie.
Not another one 😑
BEST TRAILERS SO FAR, THE BATMAN, CANDY MAN, AND HOLY HELLL THIS TRAILER!!!!! YESSSSS!!!!!!!
Why the hell does it seem like they showed all the kills in this trailer
So from running scared shitless in the original to her wanting to actually kill Michael in this one?   Pass.
Michael Scott hearing the ending of the trailer: please god no, no, no, nooooooooooooooooo!
The trailer reveals the whole film now I don't need to watch it anymore thanks
These movies were pretty good when I was younger now not so much.
Halloween ends with laurie and micheal dying in a fire
Now That Is What You Call Determination How Old Is Michael Myers He Have To Be Close To 80 An Still Terrorizer People It’s Time To Retire Mike LOL
You are telling me all these firemen couldn't jump him.
Imagine if all this in this new Halloween movie is leading up to a Dead By Daylight movie
The only thing for me was the theme song, should have kept the original straight throughout but still looks good
Michael's going to kill them all!!!
This looks incredible and is literally taking place immediately after the last film. The slaughter continues, Go on Michael!!!!!😈😈🔥🔥🔪
Freddy Kruger needs to be revisited ASAP!
I love that Michael was hiding in Laurie's gun cage...
Kyle Richards 😍😍
DBD PLAYERS HYPED RN
When a Myers with Judith Tombstone and Fragrant Tuft of Hair finally hits Tier III.
Why did they show some of the killings
Aww Shit. Michael vs Everyone 🤣
I hope they don't turn this into another "feminist-Me Too-Times Up" themed movie like the 2018 version.
What the hell too much spoiler.😤
Ya no puedo esperar maaaaaaaas!!!!!!! Por favor ya saquenla
Soy el comentario en español que buscas jsjsj
INCREDIBLE how: there are at least 5 firemen - and Michael manages to tear through them all. And: as Karen stands holding his mask (“come and get it”) - Michael is in perfect eyeline to get shot. But she doesn’t have a gun, nor is there anybody with her who has one.  For fuck sake! All they need is to draw him out into a clearing and have about 10-15 people all shooting at him, at once.
1:46 Black Air Forces  yeah mike not dying in this movie 😂
All that and "Halloween Kills" is only the second of 3 total films!?!?!?!?!
Michael Myers. Purging since 1978.
Love the masks from Halloween 3: Season of the Witch. “Silver Shamrock”
The night is still young “chills”
Ohhh i can't wait for the movie to be released🙃😎 next years.
Dumb firefighters they should have let him burn
This looks good
Trailers should be 1minute as much, 2'30 ??!! That shows half of the movie dialogue, come on!!!!!
Evil must live
Wow she old
If this movie comes oír Dead meat would be all over this because we all thought this was over but its not
“I’m coming for you Michael”  Uh…. Fuck
Niceeeeeeee
my moneys on michel
Rob Zombie killed dimension films lol
Is just me or anybody else thinks that Universal has spoiled a lot with this trailer? 🤔
Yo this looks amazing.
I am screaming 😱 trailer is so fucking goooood ❤️❤️❤️
This movie needs Paul Rudd
loop da killah :0
And there will be more of Michael after this movie, mhh, i can't wait ~
Well these seems like one of those hit the ground running movies.
What else would Halloween do?
The Halloween 3 masks were a nice little shout-out
looks trash
Did anyone think that this trailer revealed too much
So I've already commented and made it clear that I seriously CANNOT wait for this movie - the 'Halloween' franchise is my #1 Horror Franchise (of all time) & my #3 Movie Franchise Overall (of all time) just behind #1-Star Wars & #2-DC (pre-Hamada aka DC prior to their new "woke" era). That being said I did raise a couple of issues I had specifically with the trailer, however those (trailer) issues have raised new concerns regarding the movie itself... I just realized nothing about the trailer was actually scary... so, I really, really hope I'm wrong but I'm guessing 'Kills' is going to be just like Halloween 2018 in the sense that we wouldn't have any problem watching it at night while home alone in the dark.  As for the 2 other issues I had specifically with the trailer (well, I guess it could be considered 1 issue technically) they were: 1) showing too much which seems to be the consensus & 2) including a shot that shows one of our beloved, & borderline iconic, LEGACY characters dead (like seriously tho, IN THE FRICKEN TRAILER!?!?) just because you wanted to show/spoil a cool little easter egg for nostalgia points...  And just to be clear, while it might seem like it based off of this comment, I am NOT one of "those" people... if you're not either you know what "people" I'm talking about (the ones with all the talking points - "too much fan service", "Superhero/comicbook movie fatigue", "the original is perfect so there's no reason to remake it, they"ll just ruin it" etc etc - basically the "critics", YouTubers & other wannabes who repeat the same talking points because they think it makes them sound smart/professional & that people will think they know what they're talking about (3C Films anyone? Dave McCrae? at least 75% of SEN... oh whoops 🤣🤭🤐 well there are just far too many others to list)
Yooo this is gonna be so good. The first one was awesome
Laurie Strode like Steve Rogers.”What do We Do?” And them she said:”We Fight.”
Geez what a bad trailer. I feel like I just saw 85% of the plot.
halloween 3 season of the witch  masks
This honestly does look sick af
This is the real "neverending story"
Laurie: "Evil dies tonight!" Halloween Ends (2022): No, I don't think it does.
Can anyone make out what the mob is chanting?
Dang, the showed the entire movie!
halloween 2 hospital
just feel like they showed all the cool kills lol
Hands down bouta be the highest kill count Halloween film. James A Janisse punchin the air rn lmao
Damn, well thanks for showing us 80% of the movie 💀
Dave: why did you leak the trailer?                         Hilbily Dave: we're  gonna fucking die anyway.
"Evil Dies Tonight" Well, considering there's a whole nother film after this one, id say it's unlikely
What’s still irritating me is that she had a son but now it’s a daughter 🥴 imma still watch though 😪
boring will be bad
TBH I'm just cheering for Michael to pass Jason and Freddy in these next to films lmao
Michael Myers is the DoomGuy of horror movies.
Yessssss
2:19 Looks like something or someone hit Michael, so I bet Allison survives that encounter.
Welp. Take my money. Take it now.
This looks pretty good
I love Michael
I have yet to see a single comment about that INCREDIBLE cello cover of the theme. Shit is so good.
wow, they reallyfucking ruined one of the bestthrillers in history, didnt know jamie-lee curtis was a drunk methhead.
1:44 - 2:04 this sounds so fucking good!
So this is actually Halloween 3
HELL. YES.
Ahhh shit here we go again
So what's the thoughts on 'If you follow the path of Michael's victims, its a direct line to his childhood house"  - why would he want to go back there? I know he killed his sister Judith & 1st kill was there but what is he wanting to acheive going back to his old house? Has he a child like mind that wants some closure or something more supernatural? Thoughts???
Holy!!!!! Fucking!!!!! Shit!!!!!
A moment of silence for James A Janisse. Have fun, buddy.
This actually looks like he might be the best one they’ve made  had to stop watching the trailer to avoid spoilers
how the  fuck  has the towns mayor/aldermen/county executive not called in the national guard yet.   in  real life Michael would be  in area 51 by now.
I can just sense James A Janeese going oh FUCK YEAH!
The masks are a callback to Halloween 3,
Laurie strode had the right idea when she screamed out let it burn so let this franchise burn because I'm getting tired of them keep making sequels like it was clear he was supposed to die there's no way he could have made it out of that fire he  never survive very good in a fire in the second movie at the hospital why is this no better that place is like a living bonfire and yet hes not got shred of clothing on fire what the fuck this was supposed to be the last movie yet it ain't and no fireman is going to try to go in that place it is just a raging inferno they would be like trying to contain it from the outside so why ain't they useing  their water hose to spray him down it wouldn't be just fireman there they would be paramedics and police news people and let's not forget the good old-fashioned onlookers and since this is the modern day where everybody cell phones are practically a computer where the fuck is he going to go on notice hell in my neck of the woods are used to not be cameras all over the place now it is and this is a small like city mI I just don't get the logic nowadays in horror movies and we all know that the county is aware that Michael Myers there so there should be FBI and other State Police in the area already what the fuck and this  will attract too much attention I doubt Michael would want to stick around for that action remembering and Halloween 4 the townspeople and sheriff and state police shot Michael to freaking pieces before he fell into a well and then they try to blow him up but he escaped through a hole so he was lucky I doubt he wants to do that again I know he's kind of supernatural but look at his track record he's not like that invincible for god sakes they had him in prison as an old man hook to chains on a floor when is body takes too much damage it just shuts down and goes into a coma yes he's got healing but if he takes too much damage and they keep hitting his body all the time with all kinds of gunshots he's not going to recover that quickly so he's not invincible that fire would have weakened him really bad the firemen policemen wood have freaking mess him up but it would have been the state officers sheriff's department that would do the damage and Laurie strode had a soundproof plan what the frak she's had been preparing for years for it so how did it fail it didn't because they didn't want the franchise to go away so they can milk it for all it's worth that's Hollywood for you🙄
Wtf i have to watch that shit
De Mis Películas Preferidas Jamie Curtis🙏
😱😱😱😱
really ? time to send myers away ..you knocking this shit in the ground ...i lost my taste for th halloween movies .find some thing new.
Man takes a day or two to walk a couple blocks
Did they just show the whole movie in a trailer
Kenny mf Powers co-wrote this movie. Let that sink in..
Go to this link
https://youtu.be/4X3DyYIwdGE
I can’t wait… 😤👏🏾
Everyone show love
Every damn horror sequel is turning into an action movie these days.
Oh my god it's not dead yet!!???
Wow I love the masks from the super unrelated Halloween 3! Nice small detail!
Whyyyyy did they show the death of Nurse Marion????
LETS GOOOOO
"If you track Michael's victims, Its a straight line... to Baltimore."
I dont know, it looks way too “large scale” for a Halloween movie, and it looks like they showed too many moments (“want your mask?” or “DO IT”). Michael looks like hes at an disadvantage and that was never the point of Halloween. The town going after Michael shouldve been saved for the Halloween Ends, how are they going to make that one when this one is going all out already?
KYLE😍!!!!!!!!!!
0:30- 0:37 chills!
Man this trailer showed way too much, why can’t anybody make a good trailer anymore?
You just showed the entire film in the trailer. There's no point now and I'm not risking getting covid to watch it. I'll wait for the digital release.
That looked awful. Is an action movie now. They've should casted Tom Cruise for Mike Myers role.
Worst movies ever so boring lol he never die its stupid
Wow... More trash 🙄
Finally
Was there a subtle reference to Season of the Witch with the Halloween masks
I thought Jamie Lee Curtis didn't wanna do any more of these movies.
At this point, I think Satan lost his spot
Halloween: That's my purse
James A. Janisse is gonna have a lot of counting to do
ooooh I love the Halloween 3 reference! and this already looks better than the last, I BETTER not be disappointed! (again)
HOLY SHIT.... that is all
Lonnie looks like he is really digging into the past...should be nice and creepy flashbacks cant wait!
Halloween 2018: Happy Halloween Michael   Halloween kills: I'm coming for you Michael  Halloween ends: I'm sick of this shit Michael
Somehow I keep getting the feeling, as if every  single Halloween movie is combined in Halloween Kills (The Hospital of Part 2, the Masks of Part 3, the mob of part 4, the hunting of part 5 and the freakin synthesizer music of part 6)  This Part of Halloween kills all the rest of the movies🤪  Can't wait for it
Come on, man!!! They are killing cult classics with these reboots!
"He's not dead"
The devil keeps him alive.
They showed a lot of deaths
Jamie Curtis is still badass.
Why’d it have to be fire fighters 😂
I already dislike it...
Michael is ready to fuck shit up!
What did the firefighters do to him smh
Halloween(2018): Michael vs. Laurie. Halloween Kills: Michael vs. Haddonfield.
My step dads worst fear comes back.
If the Adam and Eve theory is true then we are screwed
Why does his mask look like Joe Biden
I still think they showed wayyy too much, however, I think there's a really good chasms that a good amount of the footage (the kills) aren't actually in the movie and the studio decided to throw in alternate takes & extra shots in order to get the hype up which means more views. I will be EXTREMELY disappointed if it turns out they really just showed the actual death from the movie of a certain legacy character in particular (not gonna say which one just in case others didn't/haven't picked up on it yet).
Showing way to much Fam, this only the first trailer 🤔
Honestly just gonna summarise it now , In the last one they said the reason Michael was still alive was because he wanted to kill those people yeah , so it’s clear he’s not gonna die until there dead ,
El maravilloso michael myers  Me encantan los asesinos sabicos y maniaticos como el señor michael myers  Excelente película 🎃🪓🔨⛏😍🥰😻😻🔪🔧🧨
I personally think michael is going body atleast 80 people get caught get his ass beat and hancuffed which can explain why their one scene where people are going crazy on an ambulance truck laurie goes goes looking for him then he escapes again bodies more people then ends with with one of the strode girls getting murdered
John Wick vs Michael Myers
That's wierd usually Karen's are screaming to keep your mask on not off
No matter how many movies from Halloween they make, I'll watch it. I can't wait for October.
Gives away story beats too much. Feel like I already watched most of the movie. I thought they stopped making trailers in this style. Committee think bellends.
*DeadMeat Channel breathing intensifies*
i’m so glad they kept jamie lee curtis throughout the entire halloween franchise instead of jumping into another storyline with another character and just completely forgetting about her. i couldn’t think of anyone better to play the role than her.
Good lord . . .
Michael: Nobody cared who I was until I put on the mask.
Das schiebt aber ganz anders😍😍😍😍😍
At this point Michael Myers is like a Avengers level threat
Só amo menos que o Jason. Minha velha como sempre carregando a franquia nas costas 💓
Yes finally!
Silver Shamrock masks!
This seems like a perfect movie go to see with you significant other... If I had one
I’m so going to check it out. I love the way it looks, and knowing that John Carpenter is behind it makes it all the more better.
Looks cool. I like the Halloween 3 mask reference.
Nice little reference to part III ;)
You know, I have never seen one of these movies.  Hear they are good, but just haven't no real reason.  Car hop trays from amazon.
The call backs :)
Who else paused when he broke the car window to see if there was a wrench in his hand like the original? 🤷‍♂️🤣
Here we go again
To think that if Covid never happened, we'd be watching the Halloween Ends trailer right now, not the Halloween Kills trailer. Hell, we'd have already seen Halloween Kills by now.
Bro if that granny kills him that fck you all
Michel myers is back 😈
Wowww 😍😍😍
Michael myers is the only reboot that actually I getting better not where they didn't ruin it like the nightmare on elm st reboot
After reading that leaked script people you haven't seen anything yet.
Knew that he was still alive
This why I never watch trailers anymore I know they just showed the whole movie smh
Ok they gave away WAYYYY 2 MUCH in this trailer!!! Too many spoilers!!!
Was that a Halloween 3: season of the witch Easter egg.
Anyone else spot the masks from Halloween 3 season of the witch?
I like that halloween 3 mask reference
Michel Myers seems to gain health the more he kills. Just like something out of Doom.
No mamsm, se ve mejor que la anterior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=144s
"I'll set you on fire... With gas and a lighterrrr" I was thinking it while watching the first minutes 😂😂😂😂  Were are my slashstreet boys fans?!
He'll probably be killing like crazy now that things are opening up post-pandemic.
Finally!!
Look at Cameron trying to get back on Alyson’s good side. Too bad Vicki had to die. Hopefully lil Julian is back. That kid had some of the best lines
Lets ggooo
SPOILER: as there's yet another film to come, Myers isn't defeated in this. Again. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Dead Meat is gonna have a great time with this movie
H Y P E
Can't wait
Silver Shamrock masks at 1:33 !!
He's killing everybody so he wouldn't get covid!
It's gonna be a massacre....i liked it 😊.
Michael is back !!!
Oh Please!!!! this is getting soooo stupid! Trailer looks good but damn let it go!
So this is an action movie. Never give your properties to Blumhouse smh. First wasn't great either
2:23 Cyberpunk music insues
Please just let it end. Don't do what the past Halloween Films have done. Just let it end.
Michaels got level 3 stalk bitchs
I hope he doesnt get fake killed in this one as well, like for example I hope he finally gets Curtis and thats the ending his "transendance", and the next one is the final final finale.
What a dick!  Michael could have at least thanked the fireman before killing him.
One thing I'm a little disappointed by is that it's not set on Halloween. it must be post midnight by the time the film picks up.
A true scream queen jamie Lee Curtis I'm in tears of joy let's fucking go can't wait to see how the trilogy will end
This is getting ridiculous.
Haddonfield vs Michael
So excited
Can't wait.
ez just bring ds and don't get stared at
This is gonna be savage af I'm ready
John Wick vs Michael Myers
Karen: "Hello, 9-1-1? This guy in a mask is REFUSING me service and will NOT let me see the manager. And, great, he just stabbed me. This is America, I will NOT be stabbed!"
⛄️
Hell yeah
if rob zombie isn't directing it then ill pass. This has no scary vibes.
Thanks for showing the whole movie, in one trailer.
Btw we all agree he didnt kill that girl at the end you can tell he got hit from behind
You could do a whole kill count video on this trailer!
glad its called Halloween kills because he didnt kill anything on the last one smh
I thought I saw Michael in my window when I was 12 and I’m about to turn 30 now and still traumatized. Dude a demon. Can’t kill em.
This better not the usual PG 13 jumpscare horror crap
I can’t wait for this movie I keep watching this trailer
Well jamie confirmed a hallowen ends movie so were probably gonna end this movie with a massive cliff hanger  Theory i hope im wrong but lauries death
Nigga it’s summer not even close to ……
Fuckin hell another one!!!
“ evil will die tonight “ .. ok we’ll see in the next part
Damn I thought it was over
Guess whose gonna be leading that Kill Count now Jason?🎃Michael lookin Sharp out here🔪🔪He about to go Gran theft auto sneak kill mode on all of Haddonfield.🤣
I love the Halloween iii vibes this trailer/sequel is giving! 💯
Lol what the fuck is he now?? The fucking terminator?
Among us irl
Unknown actors is the best
YES
This is going to be awesome finally Michael kills the entire town
Is calling someone who suffers from mental illness "evil" the kind of message this film wants to send?
That remake was a solid. This sequel looks like it will be just a good
Just wait until he survives in the river and gets resurrected by a homeless man
Way too many spoilers.  AVOID!!!  😡
Rob zombies 1st film is the best Halloween film ever made. Shame his sequel was terrible. The one before this one was OK but nothing we hadn't seen before. This one looks like it might be really good
Director: How many idiots does it take to kill one psychopath??  Michael: Yes please.
I stopped watching at 1:08 cause i feel like ive already seen the beginning half of the movie. Trailers like these show way too much.
aims shotgun at head and still doesnt shoot! lol
Well we know michael doesnt die from covid because he wears a mask... I cant wait for this movie ive always wanted the feel of a town versus him, not just the quiet 1 on 1 kills that no one is around. This is the energy you feel
Gimme gimme gimme!
I'm praying this isnt the entire film in the trailer. Looks like Myers is killing a lot more and that's what we want
Dead Meat should do a Kill Count on this trailer alone :v
If you pause on the witch mask you can see that Marion chambers gets killed because in the clip where she’s in the car getting attacked she’s wearing the same clothes
Damn mike is on a rampage 😎
🤣🤣
This nice
I see Kyle Richards in the trailer. ❤️
Sweet
I dunno how I feel about him going mad rampage now using saws and stuff. If it’s the Micheal from the original I can’t see him being like that. Grab a hammer, grab a knife sure. But he’s using still saws, crowbars, lights. Looks like they have tried to make him look mad
"You want your mask? *COME AND GET IT!"*  Wow, that might be the most badass line in horror movie history.
You guys just showed us everyone who dies thanks good trailer don't have to see the movie anymore iv seen it all in the trailer
I need some clarification in this timeline Is Laurie Stroode Michael Myers sister
SMH...EVERY HALLOWEEN movie Michael  dies at the end then..when the producers realize the movie makes $millions they bring him back alive and offer Jamie Lee Curtis more money to make another sequel or prequel or whatever....
*MINOR SPOILER WARNING*  ...   Looks like Nurse Marion is done for! Same clothes on the body @1:37 then again @1:58... RIP
I feel like James A Janisse is watching this with both excitement and dread. This movie is going to have so many kills dude
This looks incredible
Jesus Christ, the most loving king to all of mankind came down from his heavenly glory became flesh and died on a cross and was raised from the dead three days later by God to save us from the wages of our sin,so that for whosoever should believe in Him,confess with ur mouth Jesus is Lord,believe with ur ❤️ that he was raised from the dead and would call upon his name and repent of sin would be saved,where you will find freedom and find eternal life with Jesus,Time is short he’s coming quickly and very soon!God bless y’all♥️♥️
The whole trailer was the movie don’t even release it at this point
Halloween Fans! Hyped about this.
Just end this series already.
she took his mask off...  ThInGs JuSt GoT sErIoUs
So many people are eager to see a person gruesomely kill people...how sick do you have to be to say "I can't wait!"?
I knew this would happen. Called it.
There is already a planned sequel to this so I guess he doesn't die here either.  Or maybe he spawned little Michael Jr.
@1:33...even tied in Halloween 3 with the masks! Love it!
Can Myers please kill this franchise once and for all? Hollywood seem totally befreit of originality these days.
Transcendence leading from evil insinuates some kind of other worldly shenanigans? Hopefully not as it's a silly premise. You won't beat Rob Zombies version of Myers which is a 7 foot unstoppable monster of a man. That's scarier!
Hey guys (and dear girls) did you also recognize the black lady in nurse costume ? Michael has took and dropped her from the car in scene which is 1:28. She was also in H18. (When Michael first time entered to the street she was walking towards her car)
They need to remove that scene showing Mickheals human face. He is not human it will ruin the movie😬
The next movie is gonna be Michael Myers vs the avengers
Oh wow.  I feel like I saw the whole movie already.  Thanks.
Mirror Myers with ruin and noed
my guess is kills is allyson & karen vs michael then ends will be lauries final fight with him
not again go home hollywood !
Its Its obviously never gonna end right. ?? I
We already know what's going to happen, just like they've been doing ever since John Carpenter's original movie.
Who did what now?
Halfway through this trailer, I had to stop. There will be no point of going to go see it, then. This seems like the highlights. I'll still be half surprised. Looks like a a hell of a good time.
Them firefighters ain't deserve that😭
Is very sad and frustrating that Michael still alive because some fireman were doing their job. Gosh is sad to hear Laurie screaming "What are you doing?!"
Halloween is the best
I got your mask!  -Jake Paul
Great trailer the it gave out a bit to much
season of the witch masks in the trailer is dope this movie is going to be lit 🔥🔥🔥
The more he kills, the stronger he gets. He has to be stopped, period.
To many spoilers
damn did they really spoil the whole movie just like that 😂
When does it stop?
I’ll be watching this at the movie theater. This is my fav movie of all time. Love Jamie Lee Curtis!
I'm completely lost
is F9 being delayed again
Only thing I am going to groan about is the Headed straight towards his Childhood home thing.
What’s crazy is that the town has made a concerted effort to hunt down Michael Myers and get rid of him once and for all, but based on the fact we know that Halloween Ends is coming, we know their efforts are wasted :(
2:20... I thought Karens hated masks
Nice callback to the Halloween 3 Season of the Witch masks!!!
The crazy thing is that we know Michael isn’t dying in this movie
Where can we find this version of the theme
Halloween 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 still exist no matter how much the filmmakers wish they didn't. On a side note, still miss seeing and hearing Donald Pleasance as Loomis. Halloween with a body count, looks like Michael Myers is now Jason Voorhees. So much for taking the series back to its roots
In these trying times it is so kind of you to show us the whole movie. 😊 After all, disposable income is not as easy to come by. *Thank you!*
If Michael Myers was listening to music while Killing everyone in town . . . . it would be:  https://youtu.be/KfLVs3yv_wg
Yea...we didn't need a sequel, but I did like the first one so I'll check this out too. Don't milk this like you did in the 80's and 90's.
Blumhouse needs to Collab with Alter and Gary J. Tunnicliffe to rework a new Hellraiser series. It can be done properly, it just needs the best Horror studios of our times behind it.
How many fucking more of these are they going to make Jesus
Whatever you do, just don't kill Michael at the end.
Oh Lordy
I'm a massive Halloween/Michael Myers fan, but even I think this is just boring and just stupid. It's hard to be excited to watch a horror movie with characters that are total morons and unlikable.
This trailer has a biiig body count, I can't imagine what will the total be
This is going to be Halloween 2 (81) brutal fun! I’m so excited to see the full story
October what? What day on October?
goddddddd
This looks amazing
Glad they are using WORD "TRANCEND"  ppl need to transcend themselves from this worldly place
The scariest evil are those that are inevitable. Run. Hide. Its doesn't matter. You can still see it from miles away and do nothing to stop it, for it would be in vain.  Just a thought, but wouldn't it be cool if he took out the town and then the sequels simply up'd his game? The state. The country. The whole damm world tries to kill one man. They fail because as they said no man could've survived that fire.   He is simply   *a c c e n d e d*
I just watched Halloween (1978) and Halloween 2 (1981) about 2 days ago and I was going through all Halloween but now THE SEQUEL OF HALLOWEEN RELEASED!!!??????? HOW IS THIS KEEPS HAPPENING TO ME ALL THE TIME!??
Holy fucking hell.
anaskm çok iyi
*This is a Real Fucking Trailer!🎃🔪*
that one firefighter seeing his friend die:🗿
WHY DO THEY KEEP MAKING THESE MOVIES!?? STAWP IT
The last Halloween was one of the worst films ever made - this has to be better than that!
Michel Myers dancing someone launch the nuke .
I count 12 kills in this trailer alone in this trailer
we all have that same appointment did you know one day the Bible says were all gonna see GOD face to face he will say two things one well done my good and faithful servant meaning you surrendered your life to Christ and trusted in the LORD Jesus Christ and believed what he did on the cross or hes gonna tell you depart me all you workers of lawlessness i never knew you but you dont got to be scared of that appointment the Bible says you can be ready for that Appointment by accepting Jesus as your Saviour he washes and cleanses you and you become a Child Of GOD surrender to Christ and repent and believe in Jesus Christ believe the Gospel Live for Jesus Fear God and his commandments obey GODS word JESUS IS LORD NOT A SWEAR WORD JESUS IS THE SAVIOR NOT THE RELIGION PLEASE GIVE YOUR LIFE TO CHRIST REPENT AND BE BAPTIZED HE IS COMING SOON BELIEVE THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST
This ish looks corny
Why do these fucking trailers give away the entire goddam film? Should be 30 seconds max. Jesus
This man really just keeps getting buffed
At this point Michael is a God Even Hela from the marvel comics wont stand a chance against him.
I like how they are going to seamlessly continue from the ending of the first reboot which I thought was magnificent.
Looks super dope
"Michael Myers is Alive"  😲😱
Hi, welcome to the kill count where we tally up the victims of all our favourite horror movies. This is James A Jennis and today we are looking Halloween Kills
"Goodbye, Kyle"
We don't need another sequel of this
I can’t waittttt
"Oh yeah how bout we make a trailer where it shows every single fucking person tht dies in the movie"
Jack the Ripper 2.0 just spawned to the nearest checkpoint to play again.
Too long. Gives away too much
Now this is interesting!!!
Wait are you telling me this is an upcoming movie?
I can already tell this movie is going to be good
Kids grow up and want to be super heroes and sport stars. I want to be Myers. #fact
Typical Michael, killing civil servants and the elderly
I have Goosebumps. And you must understand i feel nothing most the time. I have No sense of humor (haven't laughed in well over a decade) Seriously. Even just grinning causes discomfort due to lack of use. (Facial Muscles)  I'm hyped af.
unlimited tier3 myers saga here we go
Sorry Dead Meat looks like you have a lot of kills in this movie to cover
literally thought this was a compilation of kills from the Halloween movie
This movie going to be good
This is always a dumb series but that’s what it is, it’s fun to watch it lol
1:32 Halloween 3 reference 🎃💀👺
Digging the version of the classic main theme, those cello strings are badass. Really ominous and adds tension.
They showed way too much in the trailer. Would’ve liked more tease & mystery surrounding his escape, instead of them giving it away here. Could’ve done without seeing the new kills too. Could’ve probably just showed some of the aftermath. Seriously, who edited these clips together & thought it was a good idea for a trailer? You showed the audience probably every cool thing that happens in the movie. It still looks brutal and I’ll probably see it, but man, whoever edited this together and whoever approved this trailer, ought to be fired immediately.
Bullshit movie
1 vs so many why ?
so my birthday is 10/31 🧟‍♂️ , i can’t wait
He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he has bourne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.  But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. ~ Isaiah 53:3-5  For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which is lost. ~ Luke 19:10  He willingly died an excruciating death on the cross for the sins of the world. God raised Him from the dead on the third day. He is coming back to judge the world in righteousness. See Matthew 24 for how the world will be before that day.   Seek Him while He may be found. ❤️❤️❤️
This movie takes “I had a long night” to a whole new level doesn’t it?
Good movie
It continues off the last one which sucked and this one looks worse
IM SO HYPED FOR THIS MOVIE
It would have been 100 times better if you all had set these new movies in the 70s.  Just sayin
Can anyone recommend me any good slasher movie🙏🏻
Wimbledon June 28 😁
Love the mask. It looks like Halloween 2 mask. I can’t waittttttt
Michael has some quick ass reflexes i would be shook tryin to fight him
Why are the fire fighters just standing and getting shredded to pieces
Dead meat is gonna have his hands full when it comes to the kill count for this movie
The music score is EARGASMIC
not even a slightest burn? lame
Uh oh Michael's Back 🔥🔪 🎃
Fun fact: this movie will have the highest kill count of all halloween films
These people really should just give up
Michael Myers still got it after all these years!
Habits are bad, but we all have them. You can break those habits with step by step, guide, tutorial videos by your favorite HabitsAndSolutions crew!
Cool that they brought back the character of Lindsey played by the same actress.
I really hope Karen doesn’t die… I’ve heard things…
I just watched the whole movie in this trailer....  $20 saved
She cut his head off before. HOW IS THIS A THING!???
Halloween kills… it’s legacy
Michael about to turn into the ultimate killing machine.  More dangerous than Jason Voorhees. God this trilogy is GONNA KICK ASS
Holding micheal's mask is the biggest mistake in all eternity   Alison please don't do it
Halloween "Kills" - Michael Myers proceeds to kill someone every five seconds in the trailer.  Me - Ooooooooooooooooooooh
This should be called The New Holloween Spoiler Count
oh yeah!! i like the way this is going!!! im sold
Kyle Richards from the original Halloween better not die!!! Nooooooooo
oh boy the masks, nice touch
I mean this looks good but why did they have to give away a bunch of the scares in trailer? I’m going to go in theatre now and watch this and except have the shit before it happens because I already saw the outcome here.
Dam,,, looks ok
Glad to know 98% of these meat bags will die and Micheal will live cause we still got one more sequel left 🤣
2:03 Is the movies final clip Laurie finds out Karen was killed by Michael, Michael calls Laurie and all she can hear is Karen gasping for air as she dies, then Laurie walks out the hospital with a lot of people outside and inside like the mob and she just stairs into the camera the most determined look in the whole franchise and the movie ends
AMAZING
Lol GETT EMMMM!
Cant wait…
*Michael Myers is just out for a stroll on that hot sweltering night.*
Dam, this actually looks fun. But movies like this don't scare me anymore like they once did in the 80s. The real evil Democrats completely desensitized me.
Jesus, just show the whole friggin movie why don't you!?
Estará muy buena,ya lo quiero ver🎃
LMAO @ the Silver Shamrock Halloween masks making a cameo.
the guy with the mask seems sus
2:07 lol is that the kid that gets cheated on in after, Noah? Well at least he’s going on to better things😂
Haddonfield funeral homes are going to make crazy money, Michael deserves a cut haha
3 1/2 months to go. So psyched! And to think, this is the one movie from my childhood that really messed me up. I couldn't go to sleep without my bedroom door ajar and the light on in the hallway.
Halloween Parabellum
bruh thanks for saving me two hours by showing me the entire movie and 90% of the kills.
I understand that it’s called Halloween Kills but that doesn’t mean they should’ve showed all of the deaths in the movie
Bit cheesy at parts He's almost an octogenarian and he's still killing. Took cialis, killing at a 30 year old's level
It wouldn’t of been to fun for Micheal if one of those firefighters was stipe miocic
I went seeing this trailer in the morning and i thinkt by myself i am gonna watch the halloween of 2018 and i am now done with watching and then you must go back to this trailer holy shit im more hyped
Kill Kill Kill looks like a good movie to me see you in the Theaters Friday Night
Time to get looped again
Love the Halloween masks from Halloween 3 in there.....
Bendiciones para ti que está leyendo este comentario 😊
"Grab my hand! Grab my hand!!! *grabs his hand **screams in horror
He just wouldn't die , will he ?
He's baaaackkk
Can't wait for Dead Meat to do a kill count, James is gonna be busy!
People talking bout this trailer showing too much lol. Bruh Michael didn't even break a sweat in this trailer. I bet these aren't even the best kills in the movie.
I’m so excited!
1:17 "you get vaccinated !"
Doesnt look very good. I'm sick and tired of this franchise. He "dies", next movie he's ALIVE just to die at the end and over and over. Plus they showed WAY TOO MUCH in this trailer...
So many spoilers in this trailer!
Yass this looks so epic!!!
this looks so much like a good finale for the series................................even though there's still one more movie left  after this.
Why THE FUCK did the firemen thought it would be a great idea to go to war with Michael Myers?????????????????🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔😂
HYPE!!!!!!!
How many shit movies have they made so far?
lol
This looks badass, it would be cool if this one leaned a little closer to gritty brutal dark action than horror.
0:32 One can say this scene represents Michael Myers walking out of the fiery pit of hell.
🤘🏾🖤
Is this real
We got Candyman and Halloween Kills now, Hollywood really tryna treat us now.
Jamie Lee's acting skills aren't what they used to......, but it seems promising.
1:27 Julian?
Why though wouldn’t he have already burned to death this just sounds like a dumb excuse
HOLY FUCKING SHIT! Can't wait to watch the movie with my brother and sister!
Mdssss
Really very much excited for this bloody thriller sequel!!!!!!🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 Michael myers is a  really scary character....
The movie looks good but no one gonna talk bout how Jamie lee should’ve died in the last Halloween when she fell off the roof
What was the crowd shouting?
I’ll be right up front at the Drive In just like for the last one!
Omgeeeeeeeeeeeeeee 🔥
This movie is going to be super Epic🔥🔥🔥💯!!! I'm a SuperFan of Halloween and Michael Myers 😯😯😯💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥, can't wait to go see this when it releases 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾😯👍🏽💯💯💯.
So all the best bits have been shown
This is very exciting and awesome
great..,. 𝕤𝕖𝕖 𝕥𝕙𝕚𝕤 𝕪𝕖𝕥  𝕋 ℝ 𝔸 ℂ 𝕂 𝔻 𝕆 𝕂 . ℂ 𝕆 𝕄
Michael would have 6 stars in GTA in no time with all that cop and firefighter killing. No military? This movie does not know its 6 star system very well.
I just can't take the violin theme serious lmao
I'm sad
I mean, it looks awesome but….. God Damn looks like they showed the whole movie and all the kills!
if the town work together that could work jeez i'm ready
When your favorite horror movie slasher gets a sequel to his already amazing remake. First time I’ve been excited for a horror movie in a while.
so what is he actually human or immortal again? I thought they gonna go with him being human. But now, im not sure bruh
This is the Halloween I've been waiting for
I should've not watch the trailer! It gave so much spoiler :(
Poor Michael. Clearly it shows that No One Cared About Him, Till He Put On The Mask.
Halloween 2 meets Halloween 4 meets Rob Zombie's Halloween but better. I'm all for it!
BRUH
Michael- hide and seek champion of the world
Boring.  Jesus! Can gross hollywood think of nothing new?
... What if y'all pour holy water on him
omgomgom
Yet he's gonna survive it again and again and again
Myers has more plot armor than any other character in a movie ever.
Can't Wait !
YES YES YES
Why we gotta wait so long😩
I am a big fan 🎃🔪🔪
Jamie Lee Curtis , solid female role model who was around before people complained about the lack of solid female role models
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=20s
The reference to Halloween 3 was really cool
God this is going to be fucking amazing
What the music? Halloween 🎃💥
This movie is gonna get intense and ugly! Get ready everyone, it's gonna be bloody 🩸🩸🩸
Dont show all the kills in the trailer.
I LOVED Halloween '78.  I even liked H20.  However, I HATED Halloween '18!  Not only did it suck, it blew!  That said, I am STILL looking forward to this.  I just wish they didn't show the entire film in one single 2min 30sec trailer!!
Damn I don’t even need to see the movie anymore saw the best moments here😂😂😂😂
Hopefully not more feminist bullshit
Whats the odds of him wearing his Fireproof overalls and mask that night
Myers
Can zoomers handle the violence?
tell it animated u better update ur vid XD
2:22 Me and the boys Rollin up to kill Ted holister again
Michael Myers dead, Michael Myers don’t care
What about JASON VS FREDDY
Go to this link
Satanic. Yuck.
https://youtu.be/4X3DyYIwdGE
This just got campy
Laurie's like: "Oh shit, here we go again"
Ta do caralho esse negócio
This October is going to be EPIC!! Ahhhh I can’t wait!!! 🔥🎃😈🔪🪓
judging by the trailer...  i estimate around a kill count of about 100... Michael Myers will be busy..
Damn! BLM got to the house first!!!
I’m James A Janice
Hey its a Halloween 3 reference cool
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=20s
Ive never seen any of the movies, but can somebody please explain to me how he is alive and how nobody can kill him.
https://youtu.be/YASfcY-MARc
How many do we actually need though seriously? Like seriously how many deaths, he's been back more times than backstreet boys
This movie finna eat i fear
I do it reaction trailer on YouTube but every Saturday
The soundtrack is fire maaaan
Another one….
Wtf is this shit
Judging by the this trailer alone Halloween Kills looks like it's gonna be an absolute fucking bloodbath as Michael Myers is gonna slaughter nearly everyone that is in the wrong place at the wrong time very few characters are gonna survive this one and i'm ready for it
Genuinely thought he stabbed that lady in the neck with a rolled up newspaper
Damn that looks intense.
Jason vorgeese can u beat this or u watching and hide
Damn, hopefully they are running spine chill.
0:34 Yep. Totally feasible. No supernatural powers whatsoever. Guys, I think this movie could be in trouble.  Edit: I was right.
Omg the look on the firefighters faces when Mikey steps onto the porch of the burning house with his weapon in hand is just bad ass. 😮😮 In my head i heard the Jerry Springer bell as he got ready to kill the whole fire dept.  Ding ding ding. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Alright I'm not gonna lie the last movie was exceptionally bloated and mediocre, this is the type of shit I want to see, got me hyped af
Glad they're actually showing the kills this time around
I am so god damn excited for this!
Micheal Meyers bout to kill whole dam town
And I thought the previous one was good!
All the town has to do is sacrifice Laurie to Michael. It’s seems that they figured that out judging by this trailer
my grandma was right….the boogeyman was real
No more running. It’s time to fight the boogeyman.
no one:  the year 2050: Halloween 33, Senile Michael Myers Returns
The dislikes are all the people who lost their life in this film
Can’t wait , Halloween is literally my favorite series !!
That violin and cello version of the Halloween Theme is getting me more and more excited!  🎻🎻🎻😯😮
About time they fight back
1:50  Omg Michael Myers is smart he went into weapons closet to protect him self from fire as the shutters are metal. He comes out when he hears the firefighter falls through the floor
Wanna watch
Why did they have to reveal so goddamn much of the story line in this trailer?
tHe LaSt. MoViE eVeR; cAsT sAyS gOoDbYe; tHe fInAL cHaPtER; tHe EnDiNg; tHe LaSt MiChAeL mYeRs MoViE eVeR
If that Karen kills him then it a big No from me
Why do I feel like they spoiled every murder scene?
Best ❤️
So he do have superhuman abilities lol  Who you got ? Him vs the Beast from Split and Glass movies
$$$Dogecoin brothers and sisters is going to be bought up by the the GOVERNMENT!! no one under 400000 will be able to buy dogecoin and theyll have the owner of dogecoin drop the cap and it will be there outer space coin ....outer space coin to the moon 🌙 to Mars and beyond the solar system!!!!!!$$$$ elon musk will have earth 🌎 rocking loving this coin and he didn't invent it
🔥 BURN IT DOOOOOWN! 🔥
I imagine he put up Kobe type numbers, in the trailer alone he got a career high lol
Not even fire can kill the boggy man
BITCH THIS LOOKS GOOOOD
NOW, WILL ONE OF YOU FINALLY take my advice, and put Michael Myers a$$ through a wood chipper...?!  ....or there WILL be another sequel after this one.
And the award for “Most kills in a movie trailer” goes to..
Wow... James A. Janisse can do a full Kill Count with the trailer alone. Smh...
He can't die as long as there's sequel potential!
So this foo can’t die? They better kill him in the most epic way
Kinda hope MM takes out the whole town so he can go live in peace 🤷‍♂️
This looks violent as hell...and i love it!
2:23 is that michael?
One hundred and twelve more days to halloween, halloween, halloween. One hundred and twelve more days to halloween, Silver Shamrock.
Man if she doesn’t just kill his ass already I swear 😂 . Every great legend has to die at some point. Freddy died Jason died and now it’s time to see Michael Myers get his head chopped off once and for all.
This movie reminds me of the new Star Wars trilogy. How are we supposed to take Michael Myers series anymore when he's basically already been defeated by 3 average women in the second movie. How can I take him serious as a villain anymore? If you recall one of the biggest criticisms of kylo Ren was that he lost his first encounter with Skywalker and lost the respect of the audience as a result. If you want people to take your villain serious you can't have them be defeated in the second act
Myers wants Jason numbers. Don’t come for the crown son. I can’t wait to see this but I hate how this showed the whole movie.
He’s still going eh?
The only turn off for me is the amount of kills shown and the violin cover. Kinda gets rid of the creepiness of the piano. Other than that, im hyped as fuck.
I LOVE that they put the Halloween 3 masks in the movie!!!!!!!!! This movie is going to be fucking BADASS!! CAN NOT WAIT!!
Why would you show so many of the kills, I feel like it took so much of the suspense away
I'm just hoping the finally show up Michaels face ..
Yeess...!!
4 more months till Halloween...Halloween, Halloween. 4 more months till Halloween...HAL-LO-WEEN KILLS
JAMES A JENES is gonna have fun with this one 🤣
About fucking time!
At this rate the third movie will take place in the morning of November.
Hey marketing team, I could have done without seeing a ton of the kills, and some spoilery moments.  That mask moment would have been a nice surprise to watch IN THE MOVIE.  You literally could have just shown the first 20 seconds until he grabbed the first fireman, and then quick flashes of townspeople revolting, and the scenes of the Strode ladies in the hospital. That would have sold me.
Me a Firemen: Well thanks buddy I didn't need to sleep tonight.
One is stuck playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self🎈
To everyone who gave this a dislike, 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
They can make 100 more movies about Michael Meyers and they won’t get old, to me at least!
Not again
Honestly, at this point I’d be ok with a supernatural twist...give me a flashback scene where this MF makes a pact with Satan and I’m on board 😂  This “unkillable man” shtick is approaching Fast & Furious levels of ridiculous lol
Oh shit, I'm so excited!!! I really thought this was a rick roll for a second, lol.
Yooooooo
I'd love to see James A Janisse do a reaction video to this trailer 👌
T1e body count in this! And Holy hell the nod to Season of the Witch. He's back 🤘❤️
Oh I miss Slasher movies.
I just hope the imax will be open I need to see this with an audience!!!!
Very Good
Haha, was that Lenny Clarke getting his brains beaten in?
Amo🙌😍
In 2078 he will still be on the screen
Good lord, did you give enough of the movie away?
Police ain’t no way!!
Amazing can’t wait !!!!!!
Can't wait.. everything seems perfect in this movie!!
Evil is out for vengeance. I'm.ready!
I love that they're incorporating elements of Halloween III: Season of the Witch! I'm in!
Holy shat, she got Mike's mask?! This movie is gonna slap!!! Can't wait
I got this whole fucking script now that the trailer is out people will finally believe me!!!!!
James a. Jannise is going to be happy
Terminator: are you going to terminate the whole town? Michael Myers: yes
Lmfao Michael was going home, Laurie completely inserted herself into the equation. Can't wait
Not only can't I wait until the movie comes out but I'm also looking forward to James' Kill Count
I broke my mouse clicking on this..
The masks from part 3!
WOW
This movie is gonna have lots of kills and chills and I’m so hyped for this!! Halloween Kills is gonna be awesome! I think this is gonna be better then the first 2018 movie. Don’t get me wrong, I really enjoyed the 2018 version, but I’m just saying that I think Halloween kills is gonna be thrilling as we all can expect 🎃
Slashers movies, never dies...
Oh I cannot wait for this movie!!!! I was born on Halloween and I love the Halloween franchise!!
OH, are we finally going to see the boyfriend get it???!!!!!!!! 🤩🔪
“We fight!”, “I’m coming for you, Michael.” Lmaoo, Laurie loves this just as much as Michael does.
You thought it was over. It's not over.
Let's see how creepy the make all the male characters in this one.
so like...just show the whole movie now?
Change the title of the moive, please, what the fuck is "Halloween Kills" It makes its sound like Michael Myers's name is "Halloween"
Of course the fire didn't even damage his ya know cloth outfit and rubber mask but ok.
prediction: season of the witch will be canon in the halloween kills timeline
I know if michael dies im gonna hate this movie so like pls let there be another sequel
Didn't love the flow of this trailer...and the cgi of him with the fire behind him 😳 please fix that
Looks like this movie gonna really suck.
we better get a clear shot of the myer's house...its all I ever wanted
ah the good old whole movie in the trailer style...leave nothing
Wow I love that Easter egg to season of the witch 🤣
How many more of these fuckin movies are they gonna make!? 🙄
Oh Michael...bring on the mayhem! 🎃
To this day I am like, just shoot him?
Thats what im talking about. I want as many kills as possible!
for some reason i want a micheal vs jason movie
It’s been like 20 years…how do you not know how to kill someone.
Damn that horrible acting from the leading female role…cringe even in the trailer
🎃It looks really good but just... blumhouse 🤮🤮🤮🤮
This shit is so over. Just stop. All these sequels suck. Halloween 1 and 2 and thats it. Let it go folks!
It would seem like this Michael fellow doesn't seem to ever die but everyone else around him can. Now I see why Elon Musk wants us to leave Earth...
Oeh! Hope Orbit Culture makes another Halloween themed version
Laurie: Evil Dies Tonight Micheal: This is a trilogy not a sequel
Заинтриговали....Ждем....)))))
Michael has been playing Postal 4 HAHAHA
Such a lust for revenge… WHOOOOOOOOOOOO?!?!
I feel like I just watched the whole movie
Are they hinting at adding supernatural stuff? With the way Cameron's gun twitched in his hand?
LFG
I bet anybody on here he wont die.?
IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS
So they made the nigga indestructible smh trash I want to watch the boogeyman not Jason goes to hell
Mike Myers went from a simpatic and sarcastic cat. To this 😣🔥😈
Nice Halloween 3 reference
Show half the fucking kills in the trailer!
OH MY...
Meh
1:25 actually no, there is gonna be at minimum at one more movie. Maybe if I heard this Halloween Ends I would be thinking maybe this is when he dies. Maybe not even that, this franchise likes to play with his death like last movie we were meant to think he died in the fire and he didn't retconning most of the last movie beside introducing new characters.
One of the best trailer till now and that soundtrack OMG...
I STOPPED WATCHING THIS AFTER 10S I am already onboard, I want to watch this completely cold, no spoilers, I'm ready
Well at least we no how Michael escapes the fire 🔥🔥 movie looks like its gonna be epic
Looks like we’re getting super violent Halloween 4/5 style kills. Awesome
How many sequels do you want? YES    SAID NO ONE EVE
It's amazing that he can survive also can't wait for the mask to be for sale
how to survive halloween? move to different country
Why would they go into the house?
This shit jumped the shark
its almost as Michael escaped Hell (the burning house) and now he's inhuman. He is EVIL.
Looks great. Time to rewatch the last one.
Чувствую эта часть будет в 100 раз лучше первой 👍👍👍
I like how they keep trying to turn Michael into Jason. Not really. What is this crap?
Man you are in theatre  And the Halloween theme in Dolby atmos  That vibe  That vibe 🔥🔥🔥
The clip where Michael jabs that firefighter tool into the helmet reminded me of My Bloody Valentine 3D. Anyone else?
Honestly excited to see how this trilogy ends. Halloween (2018) wasn’t terrible, and I enjoyed it.
Karen: "You want your mask?! Come and get it" Michael:
Michael is back with a vengeance.
Man i am stoked for this.. LOOKS FIREEE
I’m….not sure how I feel lol it had me until I saw the mob of people with weapons chanting…as long as it doesn’t try to be like an action horror movie like victor Crowley then I think can remain hopeful.
Watched trailer 4 times so fucking pumped!!!!!
This looks really good
they gotta chill with how much of the movie they reveal in trailers
Oh that Jamie Lee Citrus she has mad halloween skills the fun never ends.
Too much killing 😩
Judy Greers acting chops tho. So good in H18 and this trailer. She deserves more!
I can't wait
Holy shit, Michael vs Firefighters!
holy shit this is  beyond words like amazing
This is gonna be the best Halloween movie ever well in my opinion
Idk why but when you see the whole mob I kinda felt bad for michal
Not sure how I feel about a war the whole town vs mike lol 😂 little extreme for the story
Again ?
Hype
Honestly you need to launch Michael Meyers into space to get rid of him for good.
I am so ready for this movie!
So, now, Laurie's the one stalking in a hospital, with a knife. Nice turnabout. I wonder if Michael remembers Tommy and Lindsey, 40 years later?
omg i can't wait for this to come out! 😭😭
Release date
BEST HALLOWEEN MOVIE EVER ‼️
They are reviling to much or maybe the best is yet to come 🤔🤔🤔
Bruh how the fire fighters lose  They outnumbered him
It looks like everybody wants Michael Myers dead
Aren't Tommy and Lindsey supposed to be in this one?
So it's now the whole town vs Michael Myers nice I am in
Thanks for ruining the film with is incredible trailer lol
This has to be the most amazing Halloween movie ever.
Those poor firefighters!
Halloween 2018: Michael escapes  Halloween Kills: Michael's Alive  Halloween Ends: Michael resurrect
Will they ever stop making these
Its kinda a rehash of part 4 wtf ?
I PRAY WE SEE MICHAELS HOUSE
Jamie Leigh shoulda stayed gone. Turned the 2018 release into an s j w propaganda film. They ruined Halloween. This comin from someone who was there since the beginning and shares the protagonists birthday, Oct. 19th.
Finally a decent movie.
Looks great! But I feel they showed too much in the trailer.
SCREAM IS COMING IN JANUARY 2022
They just presented the whole plot in the trailer 😅😂🤣
Halloween has to be my  favourite horror movie series 🔥
Guys stop it. We  need a film Myers VS Jason.. Schlautering  all the town and  and at the end destroying each other
Man Michael is not playing
There gonna be a lot of kills in the film
You can see Michael hooks the fire fighter’s leg and drags him down into the basement through the floor.  EDIT: I take that back. Looks like a support board that is illuminated on the edge that falls with the FF.
Looks amazing! But you showed us so much? I want to be surprised! :)
There’s nowhere to hind now Micheal, the entire town is after you
Old man Michael’s back
5 Stacks of Devour Hope
Damn. Should be criminal how good this one looks.
*James A Janisse liked that*
Probably the best sequel movie
This looks pretty brutal. Loved the 2018 one. I wish they would just bite the bullet, and reveal he is a supernatural entity, demon, whatever. It is so eyerolling in the originals how he is just a crazy person. You get blasted with a shotgun, grenaded, or stabbed with a butcher knife I don't care how crazy you are, you aren't taking it like a terminator.
You can never KILL the boogeyman!
So they're essentially recanting their 'no supernatural'/he's just a man' angle one sequel in. I foresee Jamie's grand daughter and a now 'undead' Michael fighting for the next 20 years. I doubt the Elam kid dies either. We're entering the 'CW' era of the Halloween franchise. And good. More 'Halloween'.
So… we just gonna keep resurrecting Michael like he’s Jesus? Wow… “groundbreaking”
Where’s Ben Tramer?
I’m excited to see this movie
More Kills is Not better. Dislike
I like the credit Universal gave   "Anthony Michael Hall (The Dark Knight)"
Nice to see them actually show him coming out of the burning house.
For the love of humanity: Stop Making This Movie Already!
The dislikes is his next body count😃 damn 1 k dead
.
Please in hindi dubbed
Yooo is this isn't even the last one....
When's the fight between Michael Myers/Freddy Kreger & Jason Voorhees ?
(Goku building a spirit bomb): Lend me your power!!!  (Michael for the lulz): Stabby stabby lol
I was more terrified of Michael taking down all those firefighters than anything else in the trailer....
Doomguy: What do we do? Laurie Strode: We fight. Postal Dude: You go, girl! *pulls out his assault rifle* Doomguy: *Evil grin* Alison: Let's hunt him down. Me: *gorilla noises* METAL DANNY 420: Kaled, chill! We are going hunt the Boogieman. Dox778: Yeah man, come on! Me: Sorry, I just too happy to finally kill that son of a gun. Davoth: Soon, he will pay for his crimes.
Hell yea
Everytimes a movie of halloween ends im always like, teah he ain't dead
Michael myers
The only thing that this movie is gonna kill is my time. Hard Pass for me
fuck this movie Michael Myers not finna win in this movie waste of time
Man I’m so excited for this the 2018 film was such a fantastic way to bring life back into the franchise and this makes it look even better
Talk about flogging a dead horse. The original Halloween film is a classic. They ended it well with H20 after a couple of embarrassing sequels that we can let slide. Ressurection was an abomination and the last one...🤦‍♂️ I was so excited for it but it was horrendous and this looks dire as well. Kills me to say it but they butchered this franchise long ago.
A serial killer having a problem with an old fucking woman my god smh 🤦‍♂️
What is wrong with firemen?! They see a man stuck in a fire and they just HAVE to save him?! I’m aware that it’s their job, but still, it undid the hard work of the first movie!
I mean... there's gotta be more kills in the movie right because I feel they showed some of the best ones already.
I love how intense this feels!
"So how many people do you want to kill in this movie?" "Yes"
Майкл Майерс круто.
He’s back!!!!!!!!~ :D
I feel like the one death with the fluorescent bulb is inaccurate. Those bulbs are so weak they break on carpet.
Oh shiiiiiiiiiiiii !
1:41 It looks like Tommy Doyle is going as Negan for Halloween!!!
There was a leak on reddit last year that spoiled the entire movie...I didn't believe it at the time, but this trailer lines up with it...
Are they gonna acknowledge that thorn cult shit again?  This gonna be a great 5th continunity to this franchise.
Wondering if that's Carpenter's new score? I can't wait!
omg!!!! I’ve just witnessed the prelude of a masterpiece of horror!!!!!
Michael was very lucky ,the policemen could never catch him because  his mobile phone was turned off.
A face reveal of Mike Myers would be great.
He's killed more than Convid! 😂
Same shit
Halloween kills (2021)
laurie: evil will die tonight  Michael: you swear it!
finally the whole town is going after michael , this movie is gonna be good i see
Could Halloween Kills going to be The Last Jedi Halloween version?
The more he kills, the more transcends. And that theme song. This looks badass.
Raatsasan Movie Music 🎶 50 to 60%
“He dies tonight” The audience: No he ain’t, see ya in the third one.
1:53 no joke sounds like Plankton screaming
Looks like a lot of kills.
“A man couldn’t have survived that fire”? I think someone should’ve told Kanan that.
That is anwar jibawi’s roomate
Was it really necessary to show all the kills in a trailer? I don't even feel like there's a point in watching the movie anymore.
That trailer showed way too much!!
Looks Cool !
Feel sorry for James A. Janisse and this kill count.
OMG THIS LOOKS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING
Oh no no no
Omg 😱 can’t f****** wait for this. Can’t wait to see what the credits will be like. I’ve got a feeling this is gonna be as gory as Rob zombies Halloween 2 but with way more kills
I'm just wondering why all those firefighters outside just stood there and let him murder the shit out of them. I mean seriously, you see a dude with a white William Shatner mask on come out a burning building YOU FUCKING RUN THE FUCK AWAY!
Tell me why I want Michael myers to actually kill everyone and actually give us an ending where he staring into the camera in the distance in a menacing look and listen to a report where he still at large and to always know the boogie man is real and out there and he can kill any of us. Good way to end it cause let’s be honest here we don’t want a ending we all know that the girls to find a way to kill him and there..no I want a horror/bad ending and this is what it means… the shape will always be there yk😭
I think the real mystery here is Jamie Lynn can’t be killed either
The movie nobody asked for
This movie looks so freaking good
Yes!!!! Michael myers is back baby. A reboot done so well. This is how u do it.  Cant wait to see michael go on a rampage
wow! very cool!
William Shatner will have his revenge!!👺😅
He’s the essence of Evil
Im telling u Nemesis is a stronger killer than Myers
A fkn bloodbath😍
The only way to end him is to have Vin Diesel battle him in a street fight cause the streets always wins
Dead Meat gonna have a hard time doin this kill count
THAT LOOKS SICK!!!!!
Bro just get like 10 people, give em all rifles, corner his ass and light him tf up. The end.
THAT GARBAGE GOT A SEQUAL???? and let jamie lee curtis rest for gods sake.....remember when halloween was scary?... YH I MEMBER
#MichealMyersIsOverParty
North Carolina can you handle Michael Myers
So now he is fireproof... Ffs
Just get a f rocket launcher that will take care of him
Mike vs the whole town WOW 😳
Wow amazing!!!
Lori: Evil Ends tonight! Us: it might end tonight for you but we got at least another year to wait after this release before Halloween Ends lol
These movies keep getting more and more ridiculous. I like Jamie Lee Curtis but I'll definitely be skipping this one
This looks real good.  Loving this first trailer.
I can’t wait to see how he almost dies in this movie
LETS GO! I'M READY 🎃
Michael Myers never die ❤️🙂
Pure evil is back
Michael Miyers is the perfect Terminator, Synet should have borrowed him to kill Connor...
God this looks amazing
This looks amazing!
OMG I KNEW IT, HE DID'T DIE!! AHHH
If we don't get this trailer theme in the movies final battle I'm gonna be the next Michael Myers
They are showing all the freaking kills in the trailer
LET IT BURN !!!!!!  That poor old couple :(
YUMMY 😋
Ha…….They need to do like Friday the 13th The Final Chapter and set a trap for Michael Myers and have a SWAT Team take him out.
I love when Laurie shouts “let him burn!”
Fuckkk yeahhhhhh!!!!!
I bet that Sheriff Barker, in the cowboy hat, has some egg on his face for not taking Micheal seriously in the last movie.
I can't wait for the sequal after this one.... Mike myers takes on Jamie lee in the nursing home
I feel like these movies ain’t even like horror they just be doing anything. Halloween 2007 was THE best one.
Why would they give that escape away in the trailer. Who's putting this stuff together?!?!?!
Let Goooooooooooo
dauym
Can’t wait to watch the kill count on this
A reminder Michael is in his sixties, blind in his left eye, and now missing two fingers. And he’s still murdering folks like a demon!
Oh,....for fuck sake  This, again?
Like 7-8 kills spoiled so far..
P.S I think they just showed the whole movie
Karen is going to call the police on Michael for selling lemonade outside a cvs
We all know Michael Myers won't die in this movie because of Halloween  Ends.
When you realize Michael Myers is just a 7ft tall John Wick
Who excited for the kill count for this
"You want your mask COME AND GET IT"
Wtf this looks crazy fucking good !!! So excited and can’t wait ! 🎃
Can't wait for this! I really hope that they make a BIG horror movie crossover someday. 🎃👻🔪
Wth ever happened to John, Laurie's son from Halloween h2o played by Josh Hartnett?
HE'S BACK!!   HE'S THE MAN BEHIND THE MASK................. *AND HE'S OUT OF CONTROL* HE'S BACK!!   HE'S THE MAN BEHIND THE MASK................ *AND HE CRAWLED. OUT. OF. HIS. HOLE......!!*  I know that song was describing Jason from Friday the 13th, but dammit, it fits and right now I feel like singing!!!  Mike is back and it looks like this isn't going to be some watered down, cookie cutter, lowest common denominator movie.  I'll definitely want to keep an eye on this to see what we can find out, but it looks like in October, we'll be spilling popcorn and jumping out of our seats one more time.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Hell mudfin yeah
Love the silver shamrock masks from halloween 3
Well this is gonna be a rated x movie if the rated x symbol was still around
The Devil is not red and hot he's pale and ice cold.
Let’s fucking gooooooooo
THIS. LOOKS. EPIC. Who says Slashers can't survive in modern times.
Hurry up October!!!
James A Janise (did I spell that last name right) will be busy…
Nice but eh.
After watching this. Now I've got a question for the Og fans of Horror and Big Fans of Horror...  Who's got the most kills now??? Michael, Freddy, Jason, Chucky and who ever you wanna add on here and there total kills...
“The bloodiest, most brutal, Halloween ever made.” *Rob zombie somewhere punching the air*
NOT THE FIREFIGHTERS MICHAELLLLLLL, my boi they was helping u, dam they got the whole neighborhood rollin up on him shiii
Michael Myers for Kombat pack 3 from only DLC will be coming to Mortal Kombat 11
These fan made trailers are getting better and better. ; )
This is a little too much. Or should I say much exaggerated.
Niceee!
In every fucking new movie, strong and independent female protagonist saves the day. That’s why I stopped even pirating this garbage.
this looks so good omgggggggg
I like that they included the Nurse Lady and the Stethoscope Guy from the previous one at 1:33
At a couple points in the trailer it sounds like the song "The Heat is On" by Glenn Frey is gonna start playing. Song title does go with the trailer, but the actual song would have been an odd choice lol
Can't wait
did anyone notice the Easter eggs from Halloween III: Season of the Witch? So happy this and Candyman are coming out
Love the callback to the 3rd one
this is amazing
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn.....   stupid written all over it
This looks just as crap as the last one
Maybe full movie in trailer ???? 🙄🙄
I hate how they show so much in the trailer. Feel like I just watched all the kill scenes, lol
Okay, first they announce another Transformers movie and now this trailer? What a time to be alive!
Man I would love to see Michael Myers versus Jason who will love to see that
Que pintaza madre mia ya tengo ganas de verla
IF ALYSON DIES I WANT ALL THE SMOKE !!! !
They need to quit playing and call in Busta Rhymes to whoop michaels ass
This looks so good
Holy shit! It's finally here & it looks fantastic, I can't wait 2 see this in theaters!!
i'm so fucking excited for this. i hope alyson lives though, she is pretty badass. but michael single-handedly fucking up almost a whole town? BADASSERY! this man is unstoppable. and that scene where he comes out the house .... fucking phenomenal.
Well im not going to watch this
Halloween Kills: He's really pissed off now so everybody everywhere is gonna fuckin' die.
Wow!! Michael is getting on John Wick's level. He could kill 10 people with a toothbrush in less than 2 mins.
Can't wait 😁
How he just walks out of the burning house...  You can't kill the Boogeyman.
always the same thing over and over...next halloween movie will be the same "tonight evil dies" till the next boring movie
Why don't they just call a S.W.A.T. Team to light his ass up lol? Michael Myers won't survive that especially to the head!
This rendition of the theme song is awesome
This looks beautiful
This looks bloody as hell! And how is a whole town not able to kill one man? I’m here for it either way lmao
im coming for you michael....
Can't wait to see Michael back for  action! Woo-hoo!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
these movies SUCK
💯💯💯🎉🎉🎉❤️⚡
Wowww they can produce anything they want now and ppl jump for joy. Cattle asf
YEAH HYPPE
Read the script about a month ago, from the trailer it looks like the script was I read was totally legit, I really don’t think fans are gonna like the cliffhanger at the end!
FUCK YES! I love the whole town going on a witch hunt
You could really hear the panic and fear in her voice when she screamed "Let him burn."
How can she not go completely Sidney now? Inspired by Scream, which was inspired by Halloween
so what is Michael?
The more he kills he will evolve Michael Myers=Pokémon
Nobody is talking abt michals face rly
I wonder what Michael eats, does he frequent a local diner? Or is he more of a fast food kind of guy?
Halloween: Infinity War now next Halloween: Endgame
In October I’m trading in my N95 mask for a Michael Myers mask. LET’S GO!!!!!!
Let this be the last one please
Love Halloween they should make a series 👍
Um John Carpenter? Oh hell yes!
honestly shows way too much... kinda just spoiled the movie
I see a 6 foot plus man walking out of the fire with a mask im turning around and leaving
This looks great…but they reveal so. many. kills! Lol
Wow this actually looks gooodd
I honestly don't like the new version of the theme that much but the trailer was dope
It is a funeral director prohibited dream....having so many clients in just few days
That broken bulb rod death was savage! Also at the end where the daughter is egging him on to kill her is insane, and I don't think he's ever had anyone telling him to kill them!
GOD i'm excited for this, if this releases in any of the theaters near me i'm 100% showing up in my full michael cosplay i do  not care.
Another Halloween Movie Oh No No No No No I'm Out
It’s called Halloween kills because the studio is killing the franchise with these shitty movies (oh wait it already died long ago)
Damn I love the part with the fire department coming to help then getting slaughtered, it’s really original.
So excited! Come Michael! 😍😍😍
Halloween used to be my favourite horror franchise.. they have completely ruined it now to the point i'm not even bothering to watch this new one, it looks shitter than the last one and that was a car crash of a film!   In my mind there are still only 3 Halloween films, the original, number 2 (only coz it has to be in there for part of the storyline later on) and H20 to finish the series.
Okay this looks quite good, Michael with the saw looks fucking awesome.
Would be cool if Dick Warlock had a cameo.
this series should have ended after the second one in 81
This looks amazing
This movie was so terrible xd and there is another one now?
"He walks amongst us, brother. He's come back and...he's very angry. How does it feel to be damned?"
This looks ridiculously awesome but anybody else getting cotton eye joe vibes with the violin Halloween theme?
Same ole SHIT we've seen a MILLION times ! I used to LOVE Halloween but now its just the same thing over and over and over.. Hollywood needs new ideas !
Halloween Kills, aka “How Many Times Do We Have to Teach You This Lesson, Old Man?!”
1:55 you can't run if michael already reach tier 3 evil within
love it, but don't show the whole movie in a trailer...
been a fan of Halloween since ever and this is a masterpiece
สวัสดีครับคนไทยทุกโค๊นน
I can’t wait to see Michael butcher Cameron.
Ion know about y'all but laurie just seems like a cheesy/corny character in dis one
Excelente
Holy shit.......
You pissed Michael off now all haddonfield will pay.....
Guarantee this is going to be the Ultimate Horror Movie of 2021!!! Looks incredible!
Laurie:  Evil Dies Tonight
Michael Myers is like 70 years old.  Halloween: Old Man Strength
Halloween Kills is gonna be so terrifying!
Waaaaoooooo
This looks almost profoundly stupid.
The firefighters scream makes my heart feel so wierd
POV: Micheal Myers Fragrant Tuft of Hair
OH MY GODS OF THE HARVEST IT LOOKS BETTER THAN I COULD'VE HOPED
The man can’t die stop tryna kill him.
Looks fantastic. Gotta admit, I originally was like “how the hell is he going to live through being burned alive like that?!?”. Firefighters come. That seriously never crossed my mind hahaha
Looks beyond brutal and intense! Like the ultimate slasher film in the words of John Carpenter! This looks beyond amazing seems they definitely upped it by a thousand from Halloween 2018 which is a good thing. I can’t wait!!! This trailer was just too good and has a few spoilers which I’m bummed about but definitely such a bad ass trailer!
This looks terrible and boring.
I can't wait
Jesus 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 goosebumps. This shit pumps me up
Big flex, I was the 177th viewer on this video. Pretty sweet, huh?
this is more like a CliffsNotes of the movie, than a trailer. i stopped watching halfway through, because i'd like to save a few of the kills for when i see the actual movie :D
THIS FOLLOWUP looks fcking BADASS! Can’t wait to finally see it 🎃 🎥
Minha pressão dps desse trailer : 📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈
"Oh you said he didn't kill enough people in the last one huh?" The Writers and Directors, Probably
I’m glad they are going back to Micheal being ambiguous. Is he supernatural or isn’t he? He has superhuman strength and seemingly immortality.
Just give Michaels contract to Baba yaga
Even though I don't watch the Halloween movies and tend to avoid them, this looks like a great movie by just watching the trailer.
THAT CELLO
I love this movie
This looks like a d tier film
Let’s go
Loomis would be so proud to see what Laurie has become and what she has to do to stop Michael.
WTF!  He just won't die! LET HIM BURN!
Can't wait for October.  This movie is going to rock
I don't know I think they might have shown way too much Plus from what I was told in North Carolina when this was filming somebody told me exactly what will happen at the end so that's what I was told because I knew somebody that worked on a movie and they told me exactly what happened so I know the ending I'm not going to say what it is but I know it cuz this was filming in Wilmington  North Carolina where I'm from originally
I can't wait!
Im soooooo excited its gonna be epic😎
Maybe we'll get a new outfit for Michael and a new Haddonfield map in Dead by Daylight now that this is coming out!
I feel like I just watched the entire movie trailers are exciting these days…but they show too mich
Senior abuse in the beginning of the trailer 💀😰
The return of the remake of the sequel of the prequel's reboot ?
Wonder how he manages to sort his finger out after it got blown off by Laurie
i think this is too gorry for youtube but okay
Why watch the movie the movie when the trailer seems to show all the kills?
Man if they only had some pallets!
OMG Hype!!!
Sure isn’t looking good for real housewife Kyle Richards 😳
I came
Why are they showing all the kills in the trailer like come on way to spoil it
Wish they would make more slasher films people to soft 😭
EVERYONE START SCREAMING 🔪🎃
W
How wholesome and family friendly 😁😁
Anyone else noticed the Halloween 3 masks?
This looks awesome!!
The  2018 "Halloween" was the movie which Myers was the most regular guy with a knife and least unstoppable killing machine, judging from the firemen massacre, he's a killing machine here.
What if Michael kills all ppls in town and taking blood bath?
Im glad to See that the Fireman helped Michael to go out of the Fire  🤗🤣🤣🤣🤣nice
I'm so hyped for this goddamn.
Well that was a really good movie. Glad I watched it.
I’m all for it but how does he take out 5 plus firemen like cmon 😂😂
1:28 This is the girl with the nurse-outfit from the long take scene in Halloween 2018. She is in the background and enters a car.
Question: around 1:45-150 there’s a scene with a mob by an ambulance. Do you think it’s the mob against Michael or are they gonna probably have people who want to save Michael and lock him up?
I have been a fan of this franchise since I was a little girl. While all of the other kids I grew up around were watching Love and Basketball, I was watching Terminator, Halloween,  and Nightmare on Elm Street. Lol. I think the only halloween films I absolutely hate are Resurrection and Rob Zombies Halloween 2 (that was utter garbage)...and I only care for Zombie's theatrical version of Halloween (2007), the unrated version has a very unnecessary and misplaced rape scene in it that made ZERO sense.  As much as I love the OG Halloween films, I think it's safe to say that they did complicate the story with that "curse of thorn" thing in an attempt to explain why Michael was so evil. To this day, no matter how much googling I do, I still cannot find a clear explanation on that.  I love with these new films (as well as H20, although that one no longer exists in this timeline) they went back to the basics and kept things simple. A lot of people gave Halloween 2018 flack, which I don't get... because lately horror has been a trash show of over-played found footage, repetitive demon crap (honestly, let The Conjuring go already), and ridiculous PG-13 90's wannabe films with way too much overstated, in-your-face political undertones.  True Halloween fans will remember that the very first Halloween film was shot with a low budget, wasn't all that bloody, relied on shadows and natural sounds to set the tones for scenes, and they even had to use people from the crew sometimes to stand in for certain scenes. True horror films tell stories, not just play off gore porn and overused supernatural storylines.  What makes Halloween stand out in horror is that over 40 years (since the original one), it has manged to re-invent itself with every film (even in the dumb ones lol).  I'm so ready for this film I sat here and typed an entire excerpt about it. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Anywho, see yall at the theaters!!
This look good
“Let it burn” Jamie, break my heart like that?
The trailer felt like I watched the entire movie...
Vengo de alien legacy e exigimos una nueva série de como entrenar a tu dragon
😍😍
Wow when I saw the ending of the 2018 Halloween movie I thought Michael died in the fire
WHY??
So i guess  next one is 'Halloween Kills in Space'
Everyone or most people: The trailer showed too much, Me: But you guys asked and wanted it
HOLY SHIT LETS GOOoOoOo
Saying she's gonna kill Michael Myers in this movie is just naive and dumb; she said that in the last movie and didn't even make sure he was dead.
Looks very very generic. Only thing that looks like separates it from the other average to bad sequels we've seen in this franchise is the degree of brutality of the kills.
ТОООООП!
This is the most intense solo vs squad moment
You better add this outfit to dbd
They turned this into an action movie and it looks iffy
WOW!!!
Thank Christ that his mask is still intact
I laughed out loud when they started yelling at the fire department! This looks hilarious.
that violin version of the theme song is fire
Let’s just face it… Micheal Myers is never gonna die
I'm truly truly excited for this and I been waiting a good while for this as well and the official trailer is finally hear and I can't speak about others but for me I was not disappointed at all
I saw those Season Of The Witch Masks!
Wow...(Kevin Hart imitation)  SO EXCITED!
Is it just me or should they keep the trailer more obscure? Because it feels like they showed most of the opening to the sequel and a few of the kills. Trailers seem to try and show you the entire movie as if you have ADHD or they are massively over-produced like a Michael Bay film.
When Myers reaches tier 3:
As stated human beings like to experience murder. The comment section is an atomized understanding of society. Its just a movie? No its society’s escape from lawful existence. Without laws and fear of punitive action the most of you would murder people. You like death you cheer for it only conflict is you lie to yourself about it. “ I cant wait to see this” I bet you can’t and Hollywood knows exactly what you as society crave
This looks like the most violent movie so far
Me bringing a Gun to a Knife fight *Michael Myers wins anyway*
Not only does this look like a horror movie, this looks like an apocalyptic horror movie.
Awww man...I think he got the girl from the first one, the black girl dressed as a nurse that was headed to the party when Michael was out walking making his first rounds through the town...remember she stopped to look at him right as she got in her car, he was almost up on her but he instead went inside of another house.
Looks cool, I just hope the editing isn't as jumpy in the actual film. I'd like to be able to see what's going on.
Ohhhhh come on let Michal have peace now Hollywood ……..
This looks decent but she's says he dies tonight which he obviously doesn't because there's meant to be one more
I feel like michael was kinda just playing the serial killer game with laurie again until she locked him in that basement. That look on his face like "really, laurie? after all we been through? you finna just kill me like this?" .....he ain't mad yall. he just salty af about that basement trap lol
Okay… Did anyone else notice Kyle Richards (Lindsay) say the line, “Run, go now!” Just like Laurie told her and Tommy in the ‘78 film… It’s the little things like this that give me complete faith in David Gordon Green and Danny McBride! Can’t freakin’ wait!! 🔪 🎃
I honestly hope this is the end of Halloween. Evil finally being destroyed.
Listen I think the original film is the greatest movie ever made and the 2018 movie was its first worthy successor but this trailer just... I don’t know man.... it just doesn’t look scary..... I hope I’m wrong.
oh yeah
I have the feeling that the Kill Count on this movie will have high numbers of bodies to count.
Holy shit.
Lmao this is so stupid
Ok donc on a vu tout le film en gros la 😂
Michael Myers is like covid. You developed a vaccine to destroy it but it keeps coming back stronger and mutated.
Laurie on the hospital 2: electric boogaloo
where’s @mrhreviews !!!
I don't even have to look, just take my money now. I love this series.
1:44 and after literal chills when the bgm sets.  Laurie's granddaughter : I couldn't let any other innocent civilian die. Michael : Just wait , I'm here Laurie : Evil dies tonight Meanwhile the evil in Conjuring : What's the use of Ed and Lorraine then huh 😂 The Officer : Did u listen to the news Laurie's Daughter : Listen what  Me : Trump 2024
I mean...they have a fire hose they can use...wtf!?
Why do these trash trailers always spoil so many kills
Pay attention ppl this is how you make a movie. This near 3 minute trailer is better than some entire movies.
That is tight
Who else is waiting to see if the Shape can manage a higher body count than Jason 😁
It's about to go down...👀
Looks like it's going to be a fun Action flick
that look great
This is going to be EPIC.
Can anyone tell what the mob is chanting? I can't make it out.
Lets repair the generators 😂
I have a feeling in Halloween Ends they’re just gonna call a bunch of swat or even the national fucking guard to try and mow this fucking badass down  I REALLY WANNA SEE THAT
damn.....aiight not gonna lie Im in!!
Maybe showed to many kills
Jason : hold my beer
Everybody gangsta till Michael pops his tier 3
Which one of you let Myers hit tier 3? 😤
The real question here is how many kills is this movie gonna have when it showed that many in the trailer.
This looks good, I can't wait for it to come out!👍👍
he levels up everytime he kills  lmao
This trailer shows way too much.
Whoa....
has a lot of cool looking moments with just as many dumb looking moments. This is going to be halloween 2018 all over again, a solid 6/10
Dude....this is looking dope
Wow Danny McBride wasn't joking around when he said this time is going to be full war between Myers vs The Neighbors 🗡
Who needs Shang-Chi when we can have this! 🗡 💀
I CANNOT WAIT!
HOLY SHIT THIS LOOKS BADASS AND AMAZING AS FUCK I CANT WAIT FOR THIS :)
Anyone else got reminded of the shotgun scene in the staircase in the original halloween 4
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!! 🎃🔪⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️.....
Enough already! Endless fucking crap.
The only way to end it is, HELL IN THE CELL. Lori and Michael finally put their feud to an end.
Why are they showing all the kills?
MAN I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS!!!!
kmac2021 should make the soundtrack for this movie.
Para quem conhece bem a história como eu, desde o primeiro filme, de 1978, chega a ser emocionante ver esse trailer. Michael Myers é uma lenda.
Parody...
this new film is so disgusting
YEEEEEESSSS
Will this be the end of Micheal Myers?
Universal been dropping a lot of horror trailers lately
Laurie Strode (real name: Cynthia Myers) has a reason to fight her long lost brother and her adopted parent's killer Michael Myers from the very reason of their heritage fell. She and her grandchildren must fight. 😠.
Isnt there one more movie after this one like the final film?
Halloween is literally the only movie that if done right...can have 200 sequels of sequels and still be damn good
This movie is Michael when he’s always on tier 3 stalking...
This will be the first movie that I see in the theater since the pandemic started, and I am beyond hyped for this!! If this is anything like the 2018 movie, then please take my money.
I hope an offical unmask happens and you can see the face of true evil
It is the ultimate COMMUNISM allegory.   A MONSTER that is always coming back to kill and destroy the lifes of innocent people .
They finally admitted that Michael is supernatural but still he’s the OG killlllla
everyone believes they show to much Killing I have feeling there is way more then we what are seeing and what your seeing is what they want u to see
YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Evil Never Dies.
We want in Tamildub
I can’t wait to see this!
Ugh...this is getting ridiculous.
Yea the police would’ve been at the fire too not just firemen lol this about to be a dumb ass movie
Okay, that was fucking badass
I'm so pumped up
Covid 19 ain't got s**t on Michael Myers! Holy S**t!!!!!!!!
Way to show the entire film ! 🤦🏻
Freddy and Jason going to pop out in the end. 🤣
Really hoping this will be as good as Halloween 1 and 2
I hate trailers that show too much. There's no point in watching the movie when you know what is gonna happen. Obviously Michael survives this one too . Beyond predictable.
Right when you thought it was the end for michael myers
I am wondering which perks he running?
This is the worst cut trailer I've seen all year. Who the fuck is making these man? Fuck that guy! Apart from the amateurish cutting of it, movie looks like a fun thriller. Yes, the dialogues are cringe as fuck but atleast it's gory.
0:43 Michael Myers is stronger than Leatherface.
This man Michael doesn’t play about revenge
This is gonna be my best birthday gift ever
Hey Micheal, I know of one place your services would actually greatly be appreciated at if you don’t mind stopping by there..1600 Pennsylvania Avenue..just saying 🎃
👀 I thought I was Ready 😩 I had to Stop the Trailer... I want to be Surprised when watching 😎👍🏾
Hell YEAH!!
Michael Myers? More like Michal slayers lol
EPIC
Michael will beat Jason when it comes to kills
I have practically zero faith in this but I will see it. The first one was absolute garbage.
0:33.....it was at this moment he knew.....we ****** up.
Cringe.
They basically showed the whole movie in this trailer 🤣🤣😞🤣🤣
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Silver Shamrock mask! nice
This went from being a horror slasher movie to being Avengers Infinity War. And from what I can gather from this trailer, kills are like Infinity Stones to Michael.
A moment of silence for that firefighter who tried to cut Michael with that saw 🤣😂
"Welcome to the Kill Count, where we tally up the victims in all our favorite horror movies"
i miss good slasher films
Not really a fan of the granddaughter tbh.Shes way too generic and boring to watch
I think Micheal realized that for a 65 year old slasher killer he has an embarrassing low kill count now that all the old sequels became non canon. He even overheard some kid mentioning it in the last movie. So he really feels the urge to step up his game and save his legacy. This trailer shows it.
This looks so shit man.
This summer not even Covid can stop evil..
Dope trailer, but damn did they have to spoil so much of the deaths? That was probably all of them right there
The trailer looks legit, but why did they spoil half the kills?
starring Bruce Willis
Bruuuhhhh
At 1:50, you can see that Michael hid behind the gun rack down in the trap to avoid the fire
I think Halloween Ends is gonna take place at the hospital, I just have a feeling lol
u have no idea how long I have waited for this!!
lets go
Omg, OMG, OMG! I’m in!
He comes back more than herpes
This franchise start to look like the Fast Furious When they are will coming up in space?
If a whole town of people is going after Michael Myers then there’s one thing they better not forget to bring…      A GOOD SUPPLY OF BODY BAGS!!!!!!
Después de 3 años largos de espera por fin tenemos el Trailer de HALLOWEEN KILLS junto el Poster oficial, gracias a toda la producción... No puedo no admitir que es uno de los días más felices de mi vida y que con tan solo ver el Trailer me di cuenta de que es una obra maestra, Michael.. Nos vemos el próximo HALLOWEEN 🎃🎃🎃
al they have to do is get someone with a sniper and shoot him in the head and then boom he dead
I love how while we see a good amount of kills in action, Michael will still be having a lot of them be “reveals” like in the first one. Stringing people up, decorating them or posing them, hiding bodies.
Parabéns por colocarem um monte de mortes já no trailer! Amadores!!!
CROWD: EVIL DIES TONIGHT! EVIL DIES TONIGHT! EVIL DIES TONIGHT! HELL YES!!!
This trailer shows too much. It's like every kill is revealed. I like too be surprised when it comes to these films. Still pumped tho 🎃 🔪
Laurie Just pissed off Michael Myers even more and aggressive you can see how he kills those firefighters men and home people so aggressive with the kills   I LOVE THIS  MICHAEL MYERS  ❤️❤️
We knew Micheal would survive, but we thought of complicated genius ways, not something as simple as firefighters puting the fire off 🤦‍♂️
Cool, but are we ever going to get another Friday the 13th movie?
Someone de-masked Michael! JEEZUS. Cannot wait for this. 🎃
we knew his mission wasn’t over 😮‍💨😫
Wish rob zombie directed   This one looks lames
they showed the whole movie with this trailer
And anthony michael hall as random baseball bat guy
Can Grandma Laurie just get to sewing or something already?
Someone can help please? English is not my first language and I don't understand what group of people are saying (1:48)
SOMEONE GET JAMES A JANISSE ON THE PHONE
SOO EXCITED
Michael Myers wins 🔪🔪🔪
We're never gonna get justice for Ben Tramer are we?
How is it that this asshole keeps on surviving??
pleaseeee let this be a 15
So hype!!!
Movies go be amazing but y’all showed way to much of how people go die would’ve been better to find out ourselves
Him that outfit, half burned mask, should be add on Dead by Daylight...
"Evil dies tonight!" (Unless the returns show us we can do anther sequel)
DBD gang rise up!
Actually looks good.
Hıky shit. These kills very cool. He looks stronger.....omg i cant wait!!
Not saying that it will be a bad movie, but these trailers give it all away. I also see too much gore and violence. The original Halloween was about suspense, not the gore or violence.
Pass
Serious question, how is this dude not dead yet?
"Welcome to the kill count where we tally up the victims in all our favorite horror movies! I'm James A Jannise and today we're looking at Halloween Kills Relased In 2021"
First I Thought Yea Nice Film And Then I Saw The Hospital Scene And i Was Like NOOOOO LAURIE WHY :(
If there's no Nemchahbavaulting don't even call me at this film
The trailer makes it look like it's going to be good, but that's what I thought about the first remake, and that was a huge disappointment. So we'll see.
This is best. Ruslan vs Nemchachba
Lame, they keep killing him but he keeps surviving everything every time
It’s gonna be brutal
*Me @ **0:33**:* BULL. SHIT. *Me @ **1:42**:* ...Interesting... *Me @ **1:58**:* Take my goddamn money.
Wow that was a short movie.  Can't wait for the next!
Wow! this looks like everything we hoped for! loving the Halloween 3 Masks and the new theme!
Now it's an action movie?
This is evil within tier 5
Laurie strode inside a hospital during a Halloween movie... What could go wrong?
This movie has one message, DEAL WITH YOUR FEARS !!
Maichael Myers c'est TERMINATOR.
Can't October hurry up 🎃🎃🎃
3C Films movie reviewer: Lots of Halloween Stabby-Stabby in this trailer!
They have to stop with these movies there’s no point to it anymore the movies are getting worse and worse😂
Evil dies tonight, you been saying that for 40 years Laurie.
I just done watching halloween kills..what else is left for me in october?
Just end the series after this I'm not watching anymore
Looks like this one really steps up on the kills.
I wish thed stop showing pretty much the entire movie in the trailers.
This just proves that this franchise still has some good shit to offer.
Hype Hype Hype
I loved the first one, can't wait for pt.2💥😌
this looks really good, but i feel like they showed the whole move like one of those marvista trailers.
Nice call back to Halloween 3 with the mask.. man I love how they are tying the whole universe through these films even though they don’t exist anymore.. so awesome
It's called _Halloween Kills_ because Halloween celebration is gonna kill Michael Myers.
This guy is running permanent tier 3 and the mori tombstone with a glitched cosmetic wtf :///
Hope he simply kills them all , they acting way to cocky lol
I have a feeling that they’re going to do the Halloween 6 thing again and revealed the supernatural side of Michael
Michael Myers V.S John Wick Who Win?
Hopefully he finally gets Lori.   She was likable in the first 2 movies.  Now she is a typical hollywood  lead....
Ok...I'm in. Looks good, always concern over sequels and remakes/reboots but the first "new" one was good and this looks solid.
Lame
why is the main character a woman?
MY BOI IS BACK !!!!!!  🎃
Omg another movie about this guy that sucks
This don't look scary at all, ruining classics
Did I just see Michael Myers hopping off a caddie ? What’s next ? Drive by shooting in Halloween 3
Is it weird that I'm rooting for Michael?
This looks crap
Hyped
Wowww Michael is back🤕🤕🤕
This looks way more violent, gruesome and bloody than Halloween (2018), and I absolutely love it! I feel like most of the town people will get brutally killed
Omg This looks no.1 wow 😲
Boy those firefighters as soon as I saw someone walk out of a burning house like that I'd become the next Usain Bolt
He is the essence of evil
I don’t get these films why isn’t he dead & why don’t people run x
Laurie: "Let it burn!" Usher: "Yeah."
Gave away too much—again. Saturated with ridiculously obvious “Easter eggs,” ripoffs, and homages—again.  The last one was a huge disappointment.  Will wait for this one to reach cable.
I like how they set it straight after the first one, like the original 👌
🌛
Just think....we never would have had this badass had someone not fucked up a Captain Kirk mask.
Cannot wait to see what creative kills they come up with in this. Already in just the trailer we see a few, like the lightbulb stab, and the buzzsaw. First time I'm actually excited for a horror film.
🎃🔪
Looks like a cool chick flick
If Michael Myers Doesn't Die In This Movie I'm Going To Kill Him Myself
Take my hand lol
😲Well.. Looks like kids need to remains indoors.. As parents are going after Michael.. 😲
Very very nice, I’m very excited
At this point, Michael’s gonna have to do some super agent moves like in the Mission Impossible movies 😂👏🏼👏🏼
Sorry I am not a horror fan but the trailer looks like fun
Damn this movie looks so good!
wow... this is looking like it’ll be the wildest halloween yet😳
Badass
That stupid firefighter
Was that pumpkin mask a reference to Halloween 3?
Exicited
Thank you Universal! Now i dont have to see it in the movies
She played her part so good
Michael Myers is misunderstood.. Just like me
Another fucking Halloween sequel -_-
Helloween kills Robber robs Teacher teach
OMG
ayyy the masks from season of the witch
Omg 😍
Anyone think Michael Myers is a video game character? I mean just when you think you won the boss battle really gets started….fuckin rigged
Eita que o bichão ta brabo!!!
Is The old woman michael's sister??
I absolutely love Michael Myers, he is UNSTOPPABLE, I’m actually rooting for him.
The whole town about to get nerfed in one movie 💀
awesome! Total awesome, this movie will be great.
Well I’ll be Damned! This looks way better than the last. Can’t wait…
Just kill it already.
Soo some more SJWs??
_Evil will die tomorrow_ *Sees imdb page* No he will die next year.
I wanna see it!!!
YESSS!!!!!
Woow looks incredible!
Looks like Michael might have an arsenal of weapons in this movie.
This is going to be awesome
3. Bad things 1. Cool we’re bringing back cult power bullshit 2. STRAIGHT LINE TO HIS HOME WTF? 3. Did he transcend the retcon to get those masks?
This looks like the most violent Halloween movie yet. So hyped!
Can a slasher horror movie make you cry? I think yes!
please more and go to call mister bfw 9000
Oh yes! Oh yes! Oh yes!!!
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssssssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Disclaimer Micheal isn't dying in thisovie but he is in holloween ends
Michael Myers is back, bitches!... 😎🔪💕
Holy fuck looks awesome
Put me in the room with him. I'll take his ass out.
More of the same. Can’t wait till Halloween gets out of this Blumhouse cycle.
Is it bad that I kinda already Figured out Who's Gonna Die in Halloween Kills And be The One that Drives The 2 Remaining To Kill Michael in Halloween Ends Cause they Said Halloween Ends Was Personal Which Means Someone Will Die In Halloween Kills that Makes the Final Movie Personal
Michael vs the entirety of Haddonfield? Shut up and take my money!
He just... won’t... DIE!!!!!
In France this movie is called L'Essence d'Eville.
cant wait to watch this but the next halloween is scheduled for october 2022 and its called halloween ends which kinda makes me feel like its going to be the last halloween movie😢
So that was basically the entire movie?
I think in this movie we’re finally gonna see Michael Myers with his mask of and killing people with his expressions
U look like mika-el Myers 🤣🤣🤣
KAPAN MATINYA SIH NIH ORANG
Thanks to the trailer we know who all are guaranteed to die
So Laurie failed Michael is still alive and he's coming this time he's Unstoppable
Me reading these comments and seeing all the Dead Meat love I think the horror movie community might be my favorite type of fandom now 👍
Laurie Strode in a dying state.... Claundette Morel repairing the gens... Meg Thomas been hooking on 2nd stages...   Michael Myers (Evil Within III Stage) chase Dwight Fairfields...    GGWP .....
Few minutes before movie ends... Micheal dies. After the movie ends... Michael -" Okay,see you in next halloween."
Uuuhhhaaa
Tombstone Michael
Thank you, Universal!! This looks absolutely STELLAR!!  I do hope Michael kills that useless sheriff!!
Welcome to mortal kombat
Gaaaay
In trailer there is that much kills then what happen in movies?
FUCK YEESSSSSSS
Volvi el asesino mas grande de todos los tiempos
A lot more kills in this one , one man army
You gave to many of the kills away....
I mean if I was a killer I’d be pretty pissed like he’s after 1 person everyone’s stopping him from getting to her so he has to kill more and more people but thanks to the people for giving us a show for there death
Sh!!!!!!!!!t.... This should be called Halloween... The Purge 😁😁😁😁😁
"Evil dies tonight"  Thats what you thought in the last movie, and look how well that turned out
Is alive Me : really
doesn't look scary at all.
The previous film was one of the best horror films of recent years, as they once did..made well, scary, unexpected, suspenseful. I wish the new one too.
Metal as fuck
Very "Aliens" vibe I'm getting, where HK2k18 was very spooky, atmospheric, and scary (or at least the mood was) this has more of action horror vibe to it.  I like it though, looks like dumb crunchy fun.
Everyone out here about to purge Micheal on Halloween!
Anybody else spot Anthony Michael Hall!
This looks great
Music of the movie looks very louder
JAMIE LEE WILL ALWAYS BE MY FAVORITE SCREAM QUEEN 💕💕💕💕💕 Thank you Jamie for so many years of Halloween you did a phenomenal job with this role 💕💕💕 from my childhood all the way to my adulthood you are truly royalty 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕!!! (I feel like this is the end) cause if this man come back I’ma go kill him my damn self 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cooool
Mind blown! lol looks ffin awesome!
Oh my god I cant wait, they can not kill him, evil never dies, he will always hunt them
Finally!!! 😍😍 🎃🎃🎃 1 years to wait!! 😫 but finally it’s here!!  And the new violin 🎻 theme is wooooow
"Halloween kills"  But it's summer...   Director: I SAY IT'S HALLOWEEN TODAY!
This dude still ain’t dead?
HOW IS THIS SERIES STILL AMAZING
All anyone is thinking is “How is he gonna get out of this one??😂”😂😂
Actually really glad this is a direct follow up to the last movie. Gives me Halloween 2 vibes
I hope that Michael wins and kills off one of Laurie's family.
Can't wait to see it omg omg
This trailer gave away way too many kills 😞
How was he under custody/captivity for so many years in the first movie when we clearly see here, he’s OP
I just loved the trailer! Highs expectations here! ❤
This dead by daylight dlc is looking great!!
No. NOT ANOTHER. I AM DOING THIS GODDAMN MOVIE AGAIN. NO.
I love that remixed Halloween music! It's been living in my head rent free ever since i heard it.
Will be EPIC Dr Loomus approves 👌🏼👌🏼lol  Sikander will be giggly like a little school girl with Christmas Day and Birthday 🥳 presents 🎁 watching this 🤣🤣 while Goro makes him hot cocoa to wash down his warm famous Goro twerk printed Cookies 🍪
This abt to take over the theaters like if u agree
How can someone dislike this? I'm hyped as hell
I like Michael Myers and all…but this invincibility thing and insane power is almost too much. Yeah, I know it’s a movie and he’s supposed to be “larger than life”….but at some point, his age…..getting super fucked up over and over…actual bullets…..this guy can’t keep existing 😂
"Evil dies tonight." Uhm. No, Laurie. Not tonight...maybe next year (Halloween Ends) LoL.
Michael Myers: (Exists) Haddonfield: Of course you realize, this means war.
OH MY GOD I WAKE UP TO THIS AND IM HYPEEEEEEED  My man is BRUTAL
👍👍👍👍👍👍
Stop showing every good kill please!
Michael myer is a god, he can't die
Well, now I've seen the film but holy crap!!
I feel like I watched the whole movie...start to finish. Sure I missed a few kills and a lot of terrible dialogue but still feels like all the major plot points are covered. Won't stop me from seeing it though.
Laurie is definitely gonna die in this one, her daughter might survive, her grand daughter is gonna be one of the main people who take Michael out
What a major over kill I seen all the Halloween classics. The old lady was on the first two Halloween movies . Michael myers is so old if he was real I'd commence a ass whooping.
The worst Halloween mask . Should’ve used the 2009 one
Season of the witch was awesome now that I think about it
I like how the firefightwmers just don't run away
I cant wait
I can't wait for this Michael is the gangster
He killed the three kids with the Halloween 3 masks. Maybe he'll dropkick a baby.
They have revealed too much
What an incredibly bad trailer. That wasn’t even a trailer it was a fucking short cut of the movie. Seriously, what is the point of a trailer? To entice? Or to make a viewer feel like perhaps they have seen enough now and will wait until it’s on streaming? Stop it with these trailers that expose this much. Honestly, it’s a modern thing and the art of the trailer is lost.
Oh, the Dead By Daylight character winning a movie
Came from Citizen Z 🔥🔥🔥
Michael is just deeply misunderstood. All he wants is a hug.
So it’s Stealing ideas from the rest of the franchise. Even the remakes. Can’t wait to see what Ends will be ripping off next.
oh so now he IS super human for realsies this time
I loved they put the masks from season of the witch.
Citizen Z, I'm waiting for your video.
Michael was more vicious in the 80s with his killing I think
Guys don't worry, the new trailer did not show "any" of the murders in the movie. Everyone says it is the most violent and biggest kill count, they would not show any of the murders in the trailer if they did not have others in the movie.
Hell yeaahhh!
What is that  song?
Lmao i love how the firefighter went like YOLO and tried to kill Michael with *a circular saw*
Oh this better not suck
Oh Sweet Baby Jesus, this one's gonna be BRUTAL! 😈💯🤘
He's definitely not human, look at those hairs I mean
And some people say Freddy is number #1 🙄
https://youtu.be/wiWnqvUYlWA
Love the little nods to the other sequels in the series as well as Halloween: Season of the Witch, and the new version of the theme sounds amazing 👌
https://youtu.be/wiWnqvUYlWA
“you want your mask?! Come and get it!” Oh Bitch he will! 👀😂😂
This gunna be fucking CHAOS.
Nice throwback to Halloween 3 with the masks at the playground.
Kill them all mike all
I wonder what and when MM eats. like, does he grunt his way through the mcmenu or does he scrounge out of the fridges of those who've died by his hand? does he poop then murder? does he murder then poop in their house?
Halloween kills trailer: drop's James A. Jenisse: Looks like meats back on the menu boys!
Just look into the flowers michael
I'm coming for you Michael love it
Anyone see that reference to Halloween 2
That’s my fucking boy the baddest of all of them
Dif blumhouse release this trailer ? Bc thought not till September the trailer ? Usually don't show this much info it's amazing
It's time we lay the Halloween franchise down. They haven't been good in decades and it's not like they are the only game in town.
Why these trailers always showing way too much.We saw almost the entire movie.Cheez!
Seeing this makes me wish they made him a better kill on dead by daylight
There's one more movie in the works.  So clearly,It doesn't end  tonight
Now this is a must see
Michael is taking half of that town with him before the end of the movie.
Love that the masks are the ones from Halloween lll
1:39 CIVIL WAR REFERENCE NOBODY NOTICED
This movie looks awesome, and kinda proves what I've been saying for a while. Don't count out Michael in fights like Freddy vs Jason, no one knows how to put that lunatic down
Go on Inga from Sweden!
Omg this legit ? Love it never to much teasers for me been waiting for it since 18
Lol
yes^^ xD xD xD
Real Halloween Fans know where those 3 masks are from
OMG
Thank you, Blumhouse Productions, for showing me the entire movie in 2'30".
0:34 “Aight so who wants the smoke”
Looks like garbage compared to the last one. Shame..
I just watched all the kill scenes in this trailer 😂😂
Looks awesome
1:33 are the masks from halloween 3
One thing is for sure. The title of this movie is definitely not misleading!
I hope this isn't cheesy. I loved H18
Wwow! More slashers, more blood, more dinamics
Can't wait! Jamie Lee is gonna kick some butt!
Oh loved the nod to Halloween 3 on the roundabout
I dunno, but personally I'm not looking too forward to this movie. It feels like it's lost that element of horror and feels more like "Predator" than "Friday the 13th".  Jamie learning to fight Michael was an interesting twist... in the first reboot. I don't know, it feels like this movie is unfortunately going to be another crappy sequel.
Ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod I cannot wait
So Michael can’t die. Because of a cult, it sounds stupid but he got this mark/tattoo. That makEs him immortal.  And he only stays immortal if he kills his entire family, he’s a demon on his mission. And unless you get rid of his head or the mark. Then he can die but with it on he’s not killable. That’s why he still chases down Laurie. He has to kill family. Has to. And yes a cult gave him that ability as like a blood offering
Last I checked there was one more movie after this one so evil won't die yet
https://youtu.be/FUvnJlsz6IQ
Michael Myers will come out as trans and they will all go to an anti gun rally together tweet about the capitol riot and get vaccinated
Tf? How hard is it to kill one man lmao just shoot him in the head
Does anyone else think they showed too much in the trailer and spoiled the movie ? Its like we saw almost all the kills and how Michael escaped ,so when we see the movie nothing will be new or surprising.
Michael Myers VS a Army of Justice seeking vengeful cops and civies. It's gonna be a bloodbath like Halloween has never Seen Before. Really looking forward to this.
Looks like the best one yet!!! Can’t wait
これを観て誰が喜ぶの？残酷な映画はいらない。
The last one was garbage this one will probably be garbage. Last movie had meaningless characters in meaningless scenes with tons of plot holes. Treated the audience like they  were stupid. Looks like this movie has some blm woke riot shit in it to? What the hell?? Gotta pander to the woke mob i guess.? God why don't they know how yo make movies anymore? For fuck  sake 😒
He kills trained 80-90-100 kg fireman with out a sweat, but 50 kg girl power will prevail! :D Yaaaay! Feminism propaganda!
Everyone banding together to end Michael Myers in the movie is like a metaphor for FINALLY ENDING this franchise.
There's nothing left
How about next time you call the army instead of putting cop duty on some poor mentally deranged PtSD woman and her kids. Of course shes scared, shes gonna die and is weak as fuck.
Too much of the movie was spoiled already and those two minutes
Holy Fuck! This is better than the last one!
boogeyman has no death😢
HELL YES THIS IS ON MY BIRTHDAY DEFINITELY GOING TO GO WATCH
WE WANT A 1978 remake with the same colours 🤛
So this trailer is just every single beat of the film? Great stuff trailer editors you dolts
She had years of planning and the best she could think of was lock him in a burning house? Just sad.
🎃
So  ow hewill be the burned and disfigured  michael myers. Like the Halloween 4 5 6 timeline  and Halloween  h20 land Halloween reseraction  timeline??  It seems he just can't  help getting burned  no matter what timeline he is in lol
This movie is gonna be trash
Man this is awesome
He’s going to dethrone Jason Voorhes and he will be the new king of the SLASHERS!!
They turned Laurie into a full blown idiot in these newer movies. She didn’t expect the fire department to go to her house once she set off the fire trap? She also couldn’t make a trap good enough to kill him despite thirty years of prep?   She was incompetent af last movie so that’s definitely crossing over lol
Never knew Halloween Masks were made from Asbestos, must be an American thing.
I appreciate the fact they actually explained what makes him so invincible and its real simple
I find it so cool how at the end of the trailer Laurie says “I’m coming for you, Michael” while holding a knife and walking very similarly to him. The roles are flipped. It’s like a complete opposite from 1978. This is amazing. I can’t wait to see this.
This man left the fire unscathed.
This feels more like a "Terminator movie" than all the latest Terminator movies combined.
Anyone know if there’s a full version of the Halloween theme that’s used in the trailer it sounds like a violin/rock version?
THIS finally has some originality in it. Still mad how everybody loved the last movie which was dull, dumb and nothing new or special.
Oh shit Michel killing kids
Now,this is my type of horror movie. Where they come together & go after the killer 💪✊🔪‼
This trailer showed the whole movie. Plus some things like the "DO ITTT" were fucking cringe
James on Dead Meat is already looking up the whole population of Haddonfield to get the kill count prepared lmao
likes: 33K dislikes: 333 comments :  3330
Michael Mayers Immortal??
1:10 if they're showing this in the trailer what are the kills we dont get to see gonna be like, cause that was brutal
42 years later. MM is the granddaddy of the horror-slasher legends.
ROB Zombies Michael would rip this small dude in half :D looks better then the last trash Film....
Damn those fine ass firefighters gonna die 🥺
Yooo the Silver Shamrock masks at 1:30! So stoked for this🎃
"Evil dies tonight... or maybe in Halloween Ends."
0:30 When your dad comes home after 12 years
THE SHAPE HUNTS AGAIN  >_<
This trailer is edited so badly.
Ok this looks IMMENSE!!!!!!!!!! I’m so excited
Look at Universal man so insperatinoal
Damn! I've never seen Michael take out a group of firefighters
dude this looks sick af micheal really gonna beat some ass
This is really scary and good!!!
Baba yaga
Oh we goin BRUTAL brutal with this one! 🎃
The idea of firefighters fighting a serial killer is epic
this looks good and the fact the old actors are in it still is quite unusual hopefully this will not be a disaster
He always comes back
John Carpenter said it himself in an Interview that Michael Myers is somewhere in between the Living and the Supernatural. And that's why he's hard to kill and has Inhuman Strength.
Can anyone figure out the chanting words in the music?
I'm a huge fan of the original films but it looks like they took away the 'creepiness' of Micheal and replaced it with ultra violence.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Remember y’all we still got flashbacks to see. This movie is going to show a lot and I really can’t wait for this shit.
Jesus Christ he’s even going after innocent children too. Ngl about time he’s supposed to be evil 😂
You want your mask?! Come & get it!!.  Looks good, but really wish they hadn't shown how he got out the house til we watched the movie.
Yes yes yes Can not wait
First thing I want to say All Firefighters must pass a fitness test before getting the job that includes -Climbing stairs whilst carrying 75 pounds -Dragging a hose (an empty firefighter hose weighs 110 pounds empty and they're carrying it with gallons of water in it) -Equipment carry (All together weighs roughly 75 pounds) -Ladder raise extension (Roughly 33 pounds) -Breaking down doors with a 10 pound hammer -Crawling 75 ft -Dragging out a 165 pund mannequin -And it's common for Firefighters to keep a healthy diet and consistent workout routine And Michael (who is 55 and there is no mention of him training in the asylum before escaping) killed all of them with no trouble AFTER he got beaten, stabbed and, his fingers shot off by Laurie, Alicen and, Karen and earlier got hit by a car  Second thing -Since Halloween 2018 seems to have more similarities to the original 1978 version and that a part of the movie seems to have Laurie in a hospital trying to hunt down Michael it's possible that it will be more like Halloween ll where after the original Halloween Loomis takes Laurie to the hospital and Michael tracks Laurie there -It's also possible that Sherriff Baker might be more of a character in this movie more than he was in 2018 (probably hunting down Michael and/or trying to protect the townspeople  -Also I think the town coming together to hunt down Michael is taken from Halloween lV: Return Of Michael Myers -It also seems like while Laurie and Karen hunt down Michael themselves they'll probably forbid Alicen from doing the same which is why we don't see all 3 of them in the trailer together (they'll probably fight him together in the climax) -But Alicen is probably gonna do so anyway since she probably feels powerless since she couldn't fight back as Michael since she never prepared to fight him which is why at 1:35 we see her with her douche ex boyfriend Cameron (who is probably gonna have a redemption arc here) along with (according to IMDb) Tommy Doyle who Laurie was babysitting when Michael attacked back in the original and who also was the protagonist in Halloween 6: Curse of Michael Myers but I doubt we'll see any connection between the two movies since it is by far the worst Halloween movie -I personally believe that Tommy is helping Alicen because he can empathize with her since he was also powerless against Michael
If they really were going to kill him, they'd have a more cleaver title, like Halloween: All Saints Day or something.
james rn:😐
NO!!!! IT SHOWED SOOOO MANY KILLLLLSSSS😡😡😡
THIS is gonna be a good movie
This is kinda strange, it has slight flashes of the Thorn trilogy. Michael "ascending" and whatnot, also the big groups of vigilantes. Id be lying if I said I was as excited as the first ones release. Though I'd also be lying if I said this did look amazing.
Michael Myers even killed the fire 🔥 fighting team no fucks given lol 😆
I wish his mask was more burnt but still looks cool
So dumb
Marion Chambers is definitely the woman in the witch mask...
Myers didn't take his normal pills
Felt like this has spoiled parts of the movie
Laurie: Let it Burn!!!! Old Cap: No, I don't think i will ☺️
I saw the Halloween 3 mask. Made me smile
Pure Evil Never Dies!!
well thanks for giving out 70% of the plot already
All the gun violence going on in America killing 36000 people every year in reality. & this shitters can't kill one man with a hook & chain saw !! Enough of this bull shit movie series 👎👎👎👎
I like that Season of the Witch reference. Nice touch.
Michael Meyers vs the purge: origins🤔
Halloween chainsaw massacre
"NO NOOO NOO What are they doing?" Ummm They are attending to Michael Myers Ladies and he will be back with a Vengeance.. He's been set ablaze before ,Shot at,Hung and survived so this is nothing  RIP Laurie!!
the sequel is not on Halloween event. Laurie: Its over Mike, it is 1st November already, you should gone!!! Mike: Damn. Okay see you next year.
This is the first time a horror movie still is going with the horror movies cuz the nightmare and Friday the 13th series ist going to have a new movie and I'm exited to watch this kill count from James/Dead meat
I feel like the masks those trick or treaters are wearing are nods to Halloween III...
I love the trailer, but I think they showed too much
Michael could take on any movie villain. Can't wait till this drops.
Well he certainly kills, I've seen every death now haha
Holy fuck this looks soooooo cool!!
Plot Twist The Firefighters went to the wrong house
MM💧
Damn they’ve even got the Halloween 3 masks
Micheal is going John Wick on a bunch of random people and I love it!
The Halloween 3 masks got me so hype for no reason
“Death on Halloween” coming this October 2023
Geez....hope they weren't volunteer firefighters
The halloween night isn't over yet 🔪🎃 Can't wait!
Loomis warned them what he was 40 years ago.
Audience: Movie is gonna give us new creative kills Trailer: Yes!!
Trailer with spoilers
Wow
Scary again... But I feel like I just watched the whole movie... Too much spoiled!!
In my opinion I feel like you guys showed way to much
So they are facing an infinite tier 3 Mayer’s with insta Mori and no gens done…….. well time to DC
I can't wait to see this movie 😨
Fireeee
Anybody else notice the Silver Shamrock masks?
I mean how long u can take that grudge. They are coming at each other like forever.
please let it be good as the last one, please…
Glad we finally have a full trailer and it looks Mint 👌 A shame they included so many of his kills in this as kinda ruins it a bit… But hopefully it’s just the tip of the iceberg and he’s going for a new record 😜
Peep those Halloween 3 Masks.
Michael vs the town   Michael wins 😭
If only Scream 5 wasn’t delayed. We could’ve had Candyman, Halloween, and Scream each released in the same year, something that’s never happened before.
And its being released in October  a Halloween movie at Halloween time,  good thinking guys
It looooooks soooooo sickkkkkk
"NO NO NO!!!! LET HIM BUUUUURNNN!"  i can't fcking wait
What if Michal myers come out like covid
This movie better had more actions than talkers cause horror film ain't about people talking it's about what will people do to SURVIVE
I wana say neither the last movie OR trailer for the last movie did anything for me..     This gave me chills tho 🙏🏽
Micheal Myers can’t die 😭😭
Holy crap, Halloween 3 masks
Spoiler: Myers won’t die
Kudos to the firefighters for pulling out a FUCKING BUZZSAW to fight Michael
This is what i have been waiting for ..
💀 🎃 🧟the masks
Se ve belica !!!
This movie was supposed to come out last year and Halloween ends was supposed to come out this year but nooo covid had to fuck everything up
This myers already at tier 3 and has the tombstone add-on? Aight time to dc
I never thought Michael would kill people 1 by 1 in public with 50 people watching
Блять, как я хочу это увидеть
Aí MDS tou ansioso agora 😁
EPIC!
Man I can’t wait for Dead by Daylight to get the charred mask skin for Meyers when this drops.
Ok  Why was that the best trailer I e ever seen???? I need to see the film RIGHT NOW. Omg that film is utterly beautiful and omg Micheal is actually scary
There's one rule in killing zombies, undead and serial killer. Destroy the head.
Laurie: "evil dies tonight"  Michael: "but its November 1st now..."
My hype movie for 2021.  God, do I love a high polish slasher flick like nothing else.  Plus filmed in my city.
Hell ya!!! I love Michael Myers!!!
its 1:am and im trying not to scream because im so excited
The average floor consistently tick because ashtray premenstrually fear in a right eggplant. eatable, last club
Hy I liked the 2018 one
Michael takin out the whole city would be hella dope tbh.
super cool but i feel like you showed too much
Lame....
The trailer shows more than it should of the scenes in the movie. 🤦🏼‍♂️  I admit the trailer makes the movie look good, but the last movie before this was a massive disappointment which I knew it would be before I watched it.  I hope this time around, for the upcoming movie, that it will not be another disappointment.
Michael Myers is a demon
Let it burn 💨🔥🔥🔥
The are so many references to the older Halloween movies in here. I love it!
I AM SO FUCKING EXCITED!!!! FUCK YES!!!!
You cant kill the Boogyman!
Again?
Movie Summary: An entire town of raged mobs fail to kill a guy with a kitchen knife!
... wat? Hey remember when the francise was about a HUMAN serial killer? Good times.
Ok, unfortunately this trailer almost showed the entire movie, we already know the pacing for the movie based on this trailer. He escapes fire, the Strodes are chilling thinking he’s dead and find out he ain’t, Michael goes on a genocide run, the granddaughter decides to hunt him, riots happens, ex boyfriend vs Michael, and granddaughter fights Michael at the end.
Absolutely can't wait!!!!!!🔪
Y’all realize he really just caught like 15+ bodies in the trailer alone
Looks like poo poo 💩      Speaking of which, I haven’t pooped in 3 days, should I be concerned?
This, to me, seems like a mix of the 2nd and 4th movie and its fucking awesome
I like it  Slashers for ever
So this man has some new powers now lol. He taking people out in groups with less effort like Jason
Did... did they seriously just reference Season of the Witch with those three dead people in the Halloween masks?
Finally another movie to get me hyped
This is how the film will end... Michael will kill Karen. Set up shop in the old Myers house and wait for Laurie. Laurie will receive the news in hospital and check herself out. Michael will set up traps in the house, a reversal of the first film where Laurie had the upper hand. Michael will sit on his throne. Waiting. Cue credits.
How many more kills could there possibly be!? They showed so many!
Omg I can't wait this looks Awesome!!
Russell Crowe?
Gauntlet thrown.
1:32  Nice reference to Halloween III
Well someone needs an exorcism
We're really doing this again?
also check out Hatchet III for a great action-horror movie
a man that could kill hentai
I want it now please
Seems cliche
Makes Rob Zombies Michael look like child's play
0:56-1:00 Is that Creighton Duke?
I LOVE how they bought back the Halloween 3 masks  Season of the Witch for life!
This trailer got me hyped up af right now.
This looks like it’s going to be insane!!! The best part is you know this isn’t the final part. Halloween ends is coming too. I’m so hyped!
I'm very excited for this, very hyped. I can't wait
So…who is the idiot that called the fire department lol.
Dead meat boutta have fun with this
So he now transcending as he kills? It explains the weird teleports and him surviving some crazy shit  but this also makes it a little less realistic
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A truely dead by myers!
Hell sold baby going to see it
He killed everyone with the Halloween 3 masks on lol
Who else is pumped to see Michael back in action and the sound track is just beautifully composed
Now this is the trailer i’ve been waiting for
I see the season of the witch mask Good shit Michael
Omfg yessssss
FUCK YEAH!!!!!!
Missing Dr. Loomis RIP Donald Pleasance 🌹
It looks like Michael Myers in a purge movie
I'm genuinely fucking exited for this!
Awesome 🔥
He’s returned, Indubitably………
These movies are just silly now. Drop a nuke on Michael Myers and he stands up still wearing his mask 😂"Evil dies tonight." Please.
This feels like a mixture of a cheesy and  campy yet real horror film
Even with some of the things that to bring risk to the main characters in this trailer, Blumhouse revealing that the Strode trio will be back for the entirety of Halloween Ends is kind of a bummer, knowing they're out of harm's way (serious harm, anyway).
Who ever made the trailer should be fired for having no clue how to make a suspenseful trailer without showing a chunk of the movie.
Michel mayar is back....😍😍😍
JESUS! THAT GOT ME HYPED!!!
The dress Laurie was aearing in hospital looks very similar to the one she wore in H2
Wtf... Why this killer just dont die.... Frustrating...
I have the feeling that this trailer shows nearly the whole movie. So many kills, so many plot points are shown, it feels like there is nothing left for the movie to show us.
And now we wait for a new license where Dead by Daylight gives us a Karen and Allyson outfit
I can't fucking wait!
I mean if the whole town just grabbed a weapon and marched door to door, he wouldn’t get very far lol. Gonna get him like they did the night stalker 🔪🎃
Michael Myers feared by most, but a God to everyone. U can't kill evil. #Halloween
James A. Janisse: cool, more kill count for me
SPOILER: Michael is a robot.
One of our Indian YouTuber made me fan of this franchise ❤️
Jesus! looks brutal. Jamie lee still kicking ass...what is she like 70 something?
This trailer gave away too fucking much. Jeez.
This looks insane 🙈
Had to cut that trailer short, they got my money
Finally best crew come together 😭✨👏
This is besically the same as Halloween 4 just with Laurie now
Damn. I feel like I have been showed all the kill counts. Errr.
Nice
“Take my hand!”   …….😀
How am I just now realizing the guy with the map is Lonnie Elam?
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
I felt like the last movie was a great ending to the original and should of just ended that story. If they wanted to continue the franchise they could of done a reboot and start a fresh new take on it. But nope my worry here is instead of the well made, grounded, and the realistic tone the movie had. Now it looks like they are going full Rob zombie and just making it look over exaggerated.
Why am not feeling the hype about this ???
FUCK YOU UNIVERSAL! I KNOW THERE IS ANOTHER ONE AFTER THIS XD !!!
This Halloween, the story of Michael and Laurie isn't over yet!!! It's just begun!!!  Because Michael Myers is BACK to kill them all!!! The new chapter of the Halloween trilogy, "Halloween Kills", Coming Halloween 2021 to theaters everywhere!!!  And Coming Halloween 2022 to theaters everywhere, the final chapter of the Halloween trilogy, "HALLOWEEN ENDS"!!! AND THE STORY OF "THE HALLOWEEN SAGA"  WILL SOON BE COMPLETE!!!
Well damn thanks for showing the whole movie
James when counting kill this movie: Ah shit here we go again
Michael looks a lot more supernatural in this one
Evil walks once more. Let’s go Michael, so so excited for this film 🔥🔥🖤
Looks like the body count is a lot higher in this one
Owo looks good tho!
Halloween (1978) is the greatest Halloween movie ever!
Halloween 5: Thanksgiving.
I watched 30 seconds and WAAAAY TOOO MUCH is revealed. I won't need to watch the movie if I watched this trailer. I really wish they'd stop doing this.
Lol
First Candyman now Halloween Kills 2021 is a good year for Universal Pictures.
WARNING! Turn the trailer off and GO IN BLIND! It shows too much of the film!
I called it! I knew that the Firefighters were going to die!!😂
i’m definitely seeing this
i wanna see his face so bad
He’s harder to kill than roaches 💀
This trailer needs a warning. What happens if a kid watches it
And then Busta Rhymes comes in at the very end to kick Michael's ass again!
FUCK YEAH!! Although gotta wait till the 14th of October.. 👿 too far
Let me guess the old hag wins against him
Sick Halloween 3 reference.
Michael Myers vs Mike Tyson. Who’s would win ?
James a janisse gonna loved doing this kill count
"Michael's home.  The night he came home."
Ok. Spoiled a few kills, but at least we see that Michael isn't f***ing around.
Michael wants all the smoke. But kudos for what looks like the whole town trying to kill him this time
Super excited. But this is the problem with watching trailers nowadays. They always show pretty much the whole movie. I bet those were all the kills shown there and the ones that didn’t are probably going to be boring and off screen. I mean it should be the movie that explains how Michael survived the fire, not the trailer.
I hope there's more to this than just a body count with ludicrous kills.Oh for the days when Mikey just wielded a knife, and knew how to stalk. The real fans want terror, not just horror.
Yyyyyyyessssss Michael Myers 🎃🔪
Fuck yessssss
This movie will show that Michael Myers is more stronger and bloodthirsty than jason voorhees.
FINALLY🔪🔪🔪 I can’t wait for this October, let’s get spooky🎃🥴
N. H. II- Faithful Poems 1 and 2, N. H. II- Poems of Love 1-5, and Noel Haynes II Packages are on YouTube, and you can check them out now.
trailer was dope but showed a littleeee too much of the movie
All dead by daylight fans raise your hands for this
Doom Slayer: I'm angry  Michael Myers: Hold my 🔪
What!!!!!
The Hospital! The Silver Shamrock masks! This can't get anymore perfect. 🎃🔪
Just stop.
Okay Im impressed I like the change up finally the town is ganging up to hunt Myers.
I wanna see that
Bro it looks like Michael got 10-20 kills just from the firemen alone 🤯🤯🤯  He’s gonna put every horror movie character to shame after this one
How long is that night supposed to be?
This looks epic definitely going to be a fun and intense movie.🍿🍿🧁
once again showing too damn much.still hype tho
The amount of references from  other horror classics!!
Oh hell yeah! The music is cool too!
Halloween 3 coming if Micheal somehow lives🎃
It kind of looks like joker, will he he actually start to influence the town & its people? Maybe that’s how evil never dies, it carries on
The entire town hunting michael   Michael: You better watch out
How about a 60 Year old  Michael Myers vs the whole town of Haddonfield
1:32 heeeey its the lucky shamrock from Halloween 3
Awesome!  Oh, he'll LIKELY NOT die in the end of this film neither. But it'll be interesting.   My fave👍😎👍
The real question is when are we getting another Jason or Freddy movie 🤔🤔🤔
Fuck yeah! the whole town VS  Micheal this is a horror slasher plot I’ve never seen before :D
"Evil dies tonight!" Michael- "Nope,not till 2022".
Im so fucking pumped!!! Ahhhh
Fire Walk with Me
Love the Halloween 3 references from the masks
Michael Myers is like 104 years old.
Myers vs Whole Town
Why didn’t fire fighters just run
I swear to God this foo is eternal
Is it wrong to root for Michael to make it out alive against angry mobs? I know he's gonna be in the third one but still im rooting him to make it out alive.
BRUH YES
They showed way too much
Seems like Micheal is turing into Jason for this one
Looks epic
The Abomination will return in Marvel’s Shang Chi The official trailer for Halloween kills is here  NOW THAT’s A REASON TO STAY ALIVE IN 2021
Still gonna see it despite this feels already like a highlight reel to the actual movie lol
Man that man can never die! Literally my favorite horror killer!!
Spoiler alert: He finally dies from Covid related complications.
People still can’t understand you cannot kill the bogeyman
This looks like it's gonna be nuts I can't wait Poggers dude
Wouldn’t it be cool if they got Paul Rudd back to play Tommy for the fan service?
It looks like it's going to be good, I hope this new installment by Michael Myers is worth it 😃 🎃🔪🔪🎃
This is looking like an action movie starring Michael Myers🤣🤣
The anime community: BUT CAN HE BEAT GOKU THO‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
I’m so so excited!!
This time i love his facking mask
Ohhmaan! Amok 🎃 Amok👻 Amok!!!
It's kind of unbelievable no one on that town has an aim for a shotgun or a sniper rifle
Is hollywood still run by Pedos?
New cosmetics for Dead By Daylight! :D
Cool trailer but like most horror movie trailers it gives away a lot of the plot and the scares. So you should basicaly only watch this one time and then wqit for the movie.
im really excited but i feel like this trailer spoiled so much 😭
Mr sandman, bring me a dream.........
Terrible trailer. Literally showed the entire movie
I remember watching Dead Meets kill count for Halloween on dead meets channel and him saying he wasn’t putting Michael on the count. Holy fuck I can’t believe this he lives.
Oh no, not again..
It looks like alisons boyfriend is here again, and I think he might die
ATP we need Goku to kill this guy😂🤦🏾‍♂️💯
“Happy, happy Halloween, Halloween, Halloween 🎃  Happy, happy Halloween, Silver Shamrock!” ☘️
Crazy how people always try to stick a shotgun in his face, they have every opportunity to blow him to shreds, yet they just want to poke him with a 12 gauage shotgun, you know, instead of shredding his face off with it. Love this series, but man, they really make it too easy for him to get kills, like everyone with a gun has 2 IQ, and he has 200
It's look exciting 🙂
Ah que perra movie, me gusta ese giro de como en la 2da parte continue en el hospital... pero llevando ah todo el  pinche  pueblo queriando  quebrar ah ese miguelito xD
holy shit the kills look so good !!!
After wrong turn I will give this movie vote!!!!!!superb franchise 👍👍
Another Halloween movie ? We need another nightmare on elm street
Fucking awesome
Is it a horror movie?
Halloween 2 1981 and Halloween 1978 is awesome because of Donald Pleasance  This sequel trilogy can be more if Donald was there.
Notice how he doesn't hesitate to k!ll anyone else but he toys with Laurie and her family. There's no way that Allison can stand a chance against him but apparently he lets her hit him with various objects just for sh!ts and giggles. Michael doesn't want this game of cat n mouse to be over with the Strodes, that's why he bullshyts around with them, but k!lls everyone else on sight .
Reference Halloween 3 Season Of The Witch not bad it wasnt bad even if it was and the rest supposed to be Anthology series
I can't wait. This is so fuc*ing awesome guys. 🔪
Thanks for the spoilers again, Hollywood. You guys have a list of issues the past few years.
This is absolutely  frigging awesome💙💚💛🧡❤
Ohh another supervillain without any powers like joker.
Damn man I thought the last one was cringe absurdity with good cinematography. This actually looks good though. Hopefully the writings a lot better, atleast the dialogue.
“Evil does tonight”...does he tho??
Waiting for Dominion..
Angered many kills by that brilliant time in a row styeamly it be to of all that
Just stop... you should have stopped after 3.
maybe the ending will be michael myers hunting them without a mask inside the myers house?
They showed to much in this trailer tbh. Almost half of the kills are here.
So hyped for this movie!!! 🎃🔥🎃🔥🔪
So they made Halloween 2018 the direct sequel to the first Halloween that was supposed to be more realistic than the ORIGINAL SEQUELS, only to have SEQUELS where he a paranormal entity that doesn't die.  I'm not hating, I fucking love it, but just saying lol.
Michael looks like he bout to go ballistic in this movie and couldn’t be more happy with it
why did they have to show the kills... Like no point in watching the movie now...
So many kills in the trailer, pretty much spoilled the thrills of the movie 🥲
This has some Halloween 2 vibe in .
I'm all hype 😀🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hopefully, Laurie's mob doesn't accidentally get Ted Hollister killed.
HOLY SHIT!!!!!!!! BRING IT ON!!!!!!!
I feels like I just watched Halloween Kills. Just no popcorn
Michael Myers doesn't always die, but when he does, he doesn't
The final chapter of Halloween???
I just wanna kiss michale so bad just a smooch
I was gonna be pissed if it wasn’t released on Halloween thank y’all for keeping the spirit
What I’ve been waiting for OMG🔥🔥
Not bad!
Love how we got to see the silver shamrock masks from Halloween 3!
That last movie sucked.
I hope this is the LAST halloween movie cause i do not want another bustaryhem kicking Michaels ass moment.
Finally…… what we’ve been waiting for😈
Imagine a military drone flying in hot and dropping michael with two missiles.
Ive never been soo excited for a movie
If the mob from Halloween 4 couldn't take out Michael what make you think the Halloween kills mob can take out Michael
Such a Hollywood moments when she screams “let it burn!” To a fire trucks already passed by
It’s the Halloween masks from that weird spin off Halloween movie 😱
Evil dies after the check clears for the third movie.
This shit’s really not gonna pull any punches eh?
Estoy muy UP 😊 🤐🤫🌚👻☠️ I Love Halloween Killls 😘
There is but one true icon in horror, and that is the Shape
Halloween parts 1-42...then..the final chapter. followed by the new beginning..followed by.. A new chapter..followed by the for REAL ending. followed by a "this time we mean it" movie. jesus. let it go.
and i'm waiting for new friday the 13th movie
I have a theory that all three movies take place on the same night and “Halloween Ends” means the third movie ends the next day
I have a sneaking suspicion Kyle doesn't fare too well by the end of this...
I can't wait
Laurie goes bonkers and puts on the mask. Calling it now. Not one scene with her and Michael in that trailer, she's always in the hospital. The editing is blending Michael's actions with Laurie's. Something is off.
This one honestly gave me chills
I Guess All The Shots, Melee Hits, etc. Wasn’t Enough... So It Needs A Whole Town To Take Him On!? 🥴 Uh... Yeah, Good Luck 😂
1:33  THE MASKS FROM HALLOWEEN 3!!!
Wake me up when summer has come to past
The plot for this film looks crazy, now Laurie is the one who wants to kill Michael with the whole town
let’s all hope to god this movie doesn’t disappoint.
Meh, that was lame. I cringed at the obvious green screen when Michael emerged from the burning house. The woke trash 2018 film and the long delays killed any excitement I had for this film.
Very nice
i dont know who's more stupid in the horror movies the police or the firefighters
<\\\ SO MUCH FANTASTIC AND COOL EXCELLENT WORK >>>>>>>
Lol like garbage
Seein this trailer just makes me wanna have a Halloween marathon 🤯🤩 this is gonna be fuckin epic!
This looks so good
Trailers have turned into crib notes these days
Ok…I have a little complaint…..this trailer showed a little bit too much. I know we want to see what the movie looks like but I feel like trailer showed a bit too much for my taste.
3 days before my birthday gonna see this as an early birthday gift to myself
Cue the song "We're not gonna take it" :)
it looks kinda shitty
Just listening - with eyes closed - for not being spoiled
Literally the dumbest name for a movie title.
Yaaaasssss! Can’t fn wait
" how many Michael Myers movies r U going to make? " Directors: _Yes_
myers is gonna be seriously pissed off
The violin theme music is so fuckin’ awesome!
Less gooooo
When the mom takes Michael's mask I expect him to full on sprint after her and scare the entire audience.
*Michael Myers is back and he is FUCKING pissed The Movie*
michael myers is literally thanos at this point like what’s the point on killing innocent people when you pretty much only got one target lmao but shit looks wild
Myers is a normal man so how the heck he's not dead?
I’m gonna be honest, this looks really bad
i like how it’s not scary it’s just really interesting
When the first firefighter was killed outside the house I would have got the fuck up out of town fuck the bullshit
It's so intense
Michael got his fragrant tuft of hair and Judith’s tombstone ready
He gets scarier every film lol
Great to see Kyle Richards back as Lindsey.
0:39 I am on a sugar crash
This honestly looks fucking awesome lol
OH MY FUGGIN GOD I AM SO DAMN HYPED
I will admire I did not like the 2018 Halloween movie because they just redid every kill from all the Halloween movies and place it in one movie. I felt Halloween 2018 just did what had already been done before however I am looking forward to this one and hope they are actually Creative with it.
Michael is gonna kill more people in this one than all the previous films combined
This movie looks so freaken amazing. I literally cannot wait!! Omfg!! 😭😭💙💙
What?! Let it be as good as the last one.
When you realize there is one more movie...
Try a bag of grenades or an ak47/m60.   Shotguns???? Really??????
The world is wait for this movies 🔥
Much spoilers.
James A. Jannisse about to have a field day with this one.
You’re telling me a whole squad of modern day firefighters can’t take out an injured 70 year old man?
I mean they should've been respectful & gave a solid ending to the fans with the last film but this looks ultra violent, then again anyone worth their salt can make a good trailer
Now that’s an Avengers level threat
Marvel: I have a Hulk. Universal: We have a Michael.
All I know is they better show his damn face!! Especially if she bragging about that mask like that 😭🤏👹🤦🏽‍♂️🤡   😤
This Myers is definitely using the Judith’s Tombstone add-on
Damn, Laurie Strode's daughter and granddaughter are more becoming a badass like her.
Music in the trailer is awesome
He's no man, you are talking about him as if he were human, that part of him died years ago
Halloween Ends: Laurie Gets Charged With Arson
This looks good, they're finally going to make his kills more interesting. Using a big kitchen knife all the time gets boring.  The town getting involved would be a fresh concept for a slasher movie.
So breathtaking 😍 and it's only the trailer.
So glad to see Kyle Richards reprising her role as Lindsay from the 1978 film 👏🏻👏🏻
IM SO EXCITED OMG
All being equal, John Wick kills more people in one night thank than Michael.
Daaaammmm straight I am gana definitely watch this for sure 🤟🏿🤟🤟🏻
This movie is going to have more kills than any other Halloween movie. (even more than rob zombie’s Halloween 2)
I knew he wasn’t dead after the 2018 one
worst trailer i’ve seen in so long. feels like it literally gives away half the movie
Awesome
1:08 Sheriff Barker you idiot. It's partly your fault because when Michael escaped you covered it up because you didn't want to cause a panic.
Hype
Now this is the Michael Myers the entire franchise was supposed to depict him as. Someone who kills for no motive, not because he has to kill his entire family because of some thorn curse. Very excited!
Mikey killing the old black lady using that tube thingy looks gnarly
HOLY FUCK! HOLY SHIT! I mean.... WHAT THA FUCK! THIS LOOKS WOWWOWFUCKINGWOW!
Anyone notice the Halloween 2 and 3 easter eggs? With Lori being in the hospital while Michael goes after her, and the masks from Season of the Witch.
Legend is back again...
Wow, Firefighters really suck at fighting.
I'm So Excited Finally This Official Trailer Looks So Incredible I Can't Wait To See Halloween Kills In Theaters October 15Th 2021 ! 🙂
"The more he kills, the more he transcends."  Was she talking about Covid19?
The best slasher ever hands down!
So he's performing a ritual to become something more than human, killing people in a pattern rather than randomly creating a zodiac, interesting.
this looks sooo good
Almost playing into the mysticism of Curse in how Myers is more of a force than a human now. I like it! Defiinitely looking forward to seeing Michael fight a whole town.
I’ll give this movie a chance but this looks like absolute trash and shouldn’t have been made Hopefully I’m wrong
Michael vs the town of Haddonfield, is like in the old monster movies, the town people went against Frankenstein and Dracula.  16 weeks to go
So he IS IMMORTAL?? These writers can’t even decide if he’s human or not. Oh well, more movies I guess. 🎃
A volta do bicho papão
This, is one of the best movie trailers I’ve ever seen! Can’t wait for this!
I went to bed like 6 hours ago hoping they would release the trailer because of the leaks & I just woke up lol I've already watched it 10 times Can't wait for October, I like the trailer but the end where Karen taunts Michael with his mask is annoying asf somebody in the production has an obsession with taking michales mask off 1st h18 now this I really hope they don't show Michael's face.
“Evil dies tonight”  Like that’s ever gonna happen.
Boy I hope they aren't jumping the shark all over again with the transcending powers.
YOOOO I'M SO HYPED LESS GO
That lifted my depression
My body is ready
The trailer basically showed every death in the whole film😂😂
As i was watching this... it looks awesome. But a more interesting thought... at what point can they send a well trained millitary team after him... honestly, not a bumbling one, but a fully trained team who doesn't seperate, go upstairs by themselves, but clears a room, takes it step by step, lead him down a funnel of some sort and just destroy him. I feel like, you need to at some point recognise he could be taken down remarkably simply. Has any of these films ever even mentioned millitary?
Dumb
I am dying for this movie right now😧 like... October where you at yo
Man, the theme on violin is straight up 🔥🔥🔥
hope they didn't just put all the kills in the trailer! Cant wait for this movie.
“Evil dies tonight.”   Mikey: “Eh.”
Less actual gooo
no manchess!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3
that is a fucking tease OMG !!! TEASE :( I NEED TO SEE IT NOWWWW !!
Halloween films are overrated Thats if you are as old as i am . If your young you probably think this is the best thing since slice bread
Ok but we all know he ain't gonna die yet
Nothing against Anthony Michael Hall but why isn’t Brian Andrews coming back as Tommy Doyle?🤷🏻‍♂️
I like how we only got a glimpse of Tommy Doyle. Can't wait to see Lindsay and Nurse Marion Chambers back as well.
Hopefully Friday the 13th and Nightmare on elm street get the same treatment as Halloween.Although I really hope they don’t recon a lot of stuff from the other movies which really sucked in the 2018 one.
When is it coming out
Michael, do you need a psychiatric?
Been a Halloween fan for awhile so it look dope asf
Yay! The Silver Shamrock masks! They do remember.
In one corner the people of Haddonfield and in the other corner Michael myers
So Michael cant die until he kills his whole family? So doesnt that mean that they would all have to die in order for michael to be killed or released from his mind prison? Just my theory for an ending. But i cannot wait
This looks incredibly bad, I’m sorry.
I thought that the last one was supposed to be the final one in the series. Also, to think that the man was originally just a little boy who never conquered his demons.
holy shit bro I’m ready for this movie October needs to come a little faster
So we just going to spoil every kill now?
Everyone : Thanks people for rescuing them ....Meanwhile Michael : No thanks
Ok just from this trailer alone I counted 15 confirmed deaths.
Hope this movie is good   Cause it looks bad ass
This one might go down as the best film in the franchise. I wonder how Michael gets back to town though, I hope he’s not driving a fire truck . Imagine 🤣🎃
Yeah, Michael is definitely taking the crown from Jason as the slasher with the highest kill count. I counted 12 deaths in this trailer alone.
DAMN!!!!!!
1:38 they literally stole that line from captain America civil war xD
At least Newmis got killed in the last one so we won't have to deal with his annoyance.
Wow, now I got to go through summer hoping October comes quicker.
Danny mcbride as micheal myers
When it comes to Hollywood best of all time serial killer movie - (Michael Myers) HALLOWEEN is by far the no.1 movie who have live for 40years
Looks like the Angry Mob that hunts down the monster is back!!! Nice
Damn this looks awesome ❤️
I’m coming for you Michael🥶
Feel like I just saw the whole movie
The hype for this movie!!!!!!!!!!!
This seems like an apology for the 2018 snorefest.
1:34 you thought you were being sneaky with those Halloween 3 references,huh.
Nice Halloween 3 Easter Egg
129 days from tonight!!! #thehuntison
Sweet
Enough with Mike Meyers.. We’re ready for a new Friday the 13th🙄🙄🙄
this is the only horror reboot series that is honestly doing god's work
Those masks [pumpkin, skeleton, and hag] are the Silver Shamrock masks from Season of the Witch. Nice little nod to em.
Can't wait to see this
Really? Another Haloween film? I bet next film will be Micheal becoming John Wick- alike.
YOO THE ABOMINATION IS BACKK !! oh shit wrong trailer
I've got goosebumps I've got goosebumps I've got goosebumps I've got goosebumps I've got goosebumps !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3 <3 Can't wait
Y'all just showed A LOT of kills... Like, I'm excited, but I already was. Just wish I hadn't seen most of this.
s
This movie would be great if it weren't for the fact that they already announced that theres gonna be another movie after this one, meaning that they don't kill him in this one.
Micheal Myers vs a town
I'm a huge fan of the Halloween movies and it makes me so happy that this film is coming this year finally ❤️
When will we have someone who strong enough to beat Michael?
Hopefully COD makes a michael myers skin just like they did jigsaw
I love how they change the theme of Halloween a little bit they made it more epic this time the whole town is involved kind of reminds me of Halloween 4 when he returned and there was a little Lynch mob after him it was going to be like that it's going to be crazy and it's epic.
AS A DIE HARD HALLOWEEN/MICHAEL MYERS FAN,I GOTTA SAY THIS IS GOING TO BE THE MOST EPIC HORROR MOVIE SEQUEL OF THE YEAR,HELL PROBABLY MORE EPIC THAN CANDYMAN,I LIKED THE FIRST CANDYMAN BUT I REALLY DON'T HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR CANDYMAN COMPARED TO HALLOWEEN.
Nice to see as well that DBD lore is able to better connect with these movies as well
Awesome
#EvilDiesTonight
Wish they kept the original Halloween theme
This trailer just gave away the ENTIRE movie. Why would you reveal so many awesome kills and major plot points?
I hope this movie might mantain being rated R... I don't wanna pg-13 sh1t
1:32 did anybody notice that the masked are from Halloween season of the witch
hype
Out of all the weapons to jump Michel people use bats instead of guns smh
Damn! They literally ruined the entire movie! I thought this was a teaser. Now I know the entire plot! Fire whoever released this 🤣🎃🔪
Can't wait to see this in person 😍
you are about uh 4 months early
damn DeadMeat gonna have a big ass kill count for this lmao
When Michael Myers is done. Half of Haddonfeld will still be alive. I hope they remember you.  I am so watching this in theatres on Halloween Night.
This looks so fuckin good. It’s like Halloween 5 but better.
The only thing i got excited about was when the Season of the Witch masks were shown again
Can't Wait!
Cant wait!
Blood Bath!!!!
Let’s just hope a lots not cut from the trailer.
Damn 70 year old Michael strong AF. Also, looks like they showed at least half of the kills.
Yes sir it’s finally here
Not them ruining the whole movie
Why should I wait for October if you have already shown the whole plot?
I Can Watch This All Day 🔥😂🥰
Still watching in 2042 anyone?
Giddeeeupppp
So the more he kills the stronger he gets?
He went from tier 1 myers with scratched mirror to tier 3 myers with tombstone 🤣🤣 (dbd players who can relate) 😂😭
LET HIM BUURRRNN!!! Loved that.
Go jamie!
Death count?  The whole town!!!
2:12 He learned from the last movie not to grab the end of the shotgun.
Yo Michael Mayers face reveal in this movie lesss gooo
Kudos to the Silver Shamrock masks throwback!
So Micheals a demon now?
Michael is in evil within tier 3
Micheal Myers is going to out live us all or maybe till 100 years
Stop milking the franchise ffs, no good story and not even better kills
The sound track is nice.
it would be so much better if they'd realize that Michael is old as hell in this universe.  He's almost 60 now... so there's no way that after being locked up in an asylum for the last 40 years that he's gonna take out a battallion of firefighters so easily.  He's not a viking warrior, he's not a big huge monster killer like he was in the Rob Zombie cuts, and he's never heard of UFC, so to make him a total badass is completely unrealistic.  They should've made him hide in the house if he can stand the heat that well... and lured one of them inside then trap the rest when they come to find him, and let the fire kill them or something. Cuz one of them would've hit him with the nozzle walking out of there holding that wedge like that.  Mike would've tumbled to the next street over before he even knew what happened.
Holy. Shit.
Super hyped on this
Michael Myers is the best
Just from the first 45 seconds of this trailer I wanna know how these firemen can't stop a 60/70 year old man
I'm interested in the dude with the bat.
ok! now this look like OG Mike action! (birdman hand rub)👏🏾 wasnt a fan of 18 im not gne front yall, but if this is wut it looks like, it'll brng more light  on 18 for me. I wish these movie theaters wld do smthn dope for halloween and play the OG, H18, and Kills for a dope price! That wld do the trick lol
YAS!
1:34 Halloween III 🎃.
We want tamil, hindi, telugu....
I want this Lori as a skin in dead by daylight
Why don't the men just shoot the creep in long range?
My son is michael myers
SO FUCKING EXCITED
FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Michael Myers is mad mad he going to powerful mode
Ohhh a direct continuation! I'm in!
This is going to be a crazy movie
Me and my father was going to see this. He passed away a week before Halloween last year
Definitely my son
If you go slo mo, at 2.13 you can see a 🎃 getting shot
Can wait for it
I don't know which freak called the fire station.
They shove everything....BAD SIGN
What is this? A remake of Halloween 2. But, it is now triple the budget that old one had.
I'm too hyped!!
Wait i thought the point of the last movie was going back to basics and leaving all the supernatural stuff behind. So now michael is basicly an unkillable demon again. like why ? Well if you want to kill the Franchise again the exact same way, there you go i guess
Dead meats gon have fun with this
Crazy, seems like Michael is going to die but I know that they got another movie to make after this so I wonder how he’s going to survive this time
This movies is basura. The whole point of Michael was about him being spooky and stalking his victims.  Rob zombie did a great job at making him a savage ruthless killer but in this one they make Michael the victim and he is continuing to be the hunted not only by the strodes but the entire town. It looks fucking stupid probably will be the worst one to date. I'll be watching it for the sake of another watching another halllween movie.
wack
I will triumph.
James A. Janisse: “great, more bodies to count”
Just call rambo boom probably solved
0:39 Ohhh nice mori michael
Yes, indeed!!!  🎃
Now that's the🎃 Michael who will definitely kill🔪
Mannn, I can’t waitttt! 😭
How many times are they gonna make this fucking movie?
He is becoming Jason. After all this years. He is unstopable!
Looks sick but there was a lot in this trailer I hope there is stuff we haven’t seen
Looks amazing
an entire town teaming up to stop one crazy old man this is gonna be epic
https://youtube.com/channel/UCihoMu-p5-BI0L76s-jTUFQ
If there ever was an evil that you couldn’t kill no matter what you did… Michael Myers is that evil. I don’t even think that God himself could kill him he’s the devil’s ultimate weapon of destruction!!! #HappyHalloween #HalloweenKills 🎃🔪
Ab maza ayega
I think the last is Halloween Ends.
Dam I’m so excited
This Is going to be a classic
Halloween Ends in 2022 as well?
Is this a new cover of the music just for the movie or is that song an existing cover?
The idea that the Scream 5 trailer might play before this in theaters is triple exciting 😋
The silver shamrock masks looks like this one will have Halloween 3 Easter eggs just like the 2018 one
aside from the fact that I feel like I literally just watched every kill scene in the movie... It looks okay.
If theres one way to kill Michael Myers for good is to use the Soul Stone to rip out his evil soul from his body and permanently destroy it, he is forever destroyed as it should have been.
there gonna make him be this killer yet succumb to the daughter?!?! How the fuck could she get his mask yet he killed a whole squad of trained fire fighters?? Like, no one thought to shoot him. Or ever shoot him in the face. this won't end well forsure
WE HUNT!
So we just watched the entire movie.  Sweet.  Can save a couple bucks.
I once saw him kill a woman with a light bulb, with a fucking light bulb
YES YES YES YES
He never dies : )
Firefighters vs Michael Myers take my money already imax
🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🎃🎃🎃🎃 this looks so freaking good and I cannot wait!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😱😱😱😱🤯🤯🤯
This looks fucking awful. Really out of ideas Hollywood.
OMG DUDE THIS LOOKS ABSOLUTELY BADDASS 💯
Michael Myers Returned 🤘🏻
Michael looks so much more aggressive in this jawn! I love it 🥰
The old lady had vibes of John Wick .
Flesh and blood huh?  How the hell this dude done survived all the stuff that done happened to him smh.  After over 30 years of this i demand an explanation lol
Holly Sh*t!!!!!!!!😱😱😱😱😱😱
When the world did NOT need him he came back.
The hunter has become the hunted!!!!  Can't wait until October.
Why the fuck you have to spoil kills? I mean now you gonna watch this movie and be like he dies and she dies. Thanks Universal way to spoil.
In such films, as I understand it, there is neither an army nor an adequate police for that is, one woman solves all the problems. The old parts about Mikey were somehow more interesting (
Please release in Indian🇮🇳 Languages (Telugu)
SILVER☘️SHAMROCK🎃💀🧙🏼
Gaaawwwwd DAMN! Now *THAT'S* how you make a trailer! 🎃
Any spoilers in the trailer? Should I watch it or not?
It come home only bigger & evil murder psychopath then any entry of the Halloween franchise
Quick! Someone get Donald Pleasence!
LETS GOOOOO
This looks like a bunch of little kids standing up to the bully that steals their lunch money...
Of course he's not dead.
MT BOM
plot twist: micheal myers took steroids.
Shouldn't have called it a trailer. They're showing the whole fucking movie already!
Love the shots of him in the fire at the beginning. Great symbolism. I’m in!
Hahahaha whatttt he never dies nooooo
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16 KJV,  Jesus Christ is the only way.....
Yeah I kinda think everyone knows he wasn’t dead
WTF is this utter bullshit!!!!!!
looks good
FUCK YEAH!!!! SOO GOOD LOOKING!!!
If Michael is killing the town’s population, then there would be an army to kill him.
This looks dumb as shit...I love it
October can't get here fast enough OMG. It's legit Michael Myers vs The Haddonfield Townspeople.
I love the old creepy sounds never gets old
I hope it's available both on Cinema and streaming services.
He will never be killed
Disrespectful to firemen
Okay right off the bat this looks like it's going to be way better than the last one
F U
MASTERPIECE IS COMING, HOLY SHIT. THAT'S CINEMA.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥LETS GOOOOOOOO
In this trailer alone there’s 15 kills ☠️
Michael myers never die 😂💪
yes omg
There is still going to be another after this called halloween ends
Sumpah kagak mati mati nih orangg🤣🤣
@Dead Meat can do a whole kill count vid off this video
Lmao old man mcgee here just casually slaughtering the entire fire department 1 v 5.
Halloween has always been my favorite franchise and Michael Mers has always been my "boogeyman."  I hated the Rob Zombie ones because they replaced suspense with gore.  The fear came from not knowing where he was.  He was a silent, relentless, and deadly force.  In the RZ movies he just showed up and stabbed everyone a million times.  NO suspense at all.  But to his credit Rob added new backstory and depth that hadn't been there before.  this new trilogy seems to be the best of both worlds.  It brought back Jamie Lee Curtis to really delve into how something like that would effect a person for the rest of their lives, but also brought back suspense and "edge of your seat" thrills for the purists.  I can't freaking wait for october.  I just wish it was this year
Can’t wait
Those are the mask from 2 or 3
I’m sold I don’t want to watch anymore trailers don’t want to spoil all the movie.
Looks like William shatner is back to killing
HOLY
Well I guess we’ll see how much patience James has to count these kills
Now I’m wondering if this ends on a cliffhanger, due to the fact that there’s one more movie (promptly titled “Halloween Ends”) after this…
It'll never match the original but I just hope it's better than the last one.
I just watched the whole movie in this trailer lol.I still want to see tho.
again? does he not age? wats happening?
So is it true??? There was supposed to be one other after this? Halloween kills then Halloween ends but i read somewhere that when COVID hit they pushed the release dates back a year.. this one was coming out last year. And instead combined them into this one movie. It was originally gonna be the same night split into two movies but now in just this one so no more Halloween ends
For once I appreciate they actually show us how he miraculously survived the fire. When Michael is this never ending , can never really die- entity he instantly becomes ‘less real’ thus, less scary. When Michael is humanised he becomes more sinister and evil and scary.
Ah finally.
apparently Michael didn't like the H3 masks either :P :D (they brought them back just so the people wearing them could get killed off? :D)
Finally 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This version of Michael Myers is versatile. But the Old Michael Myers hides and stalks you with a kitchen knife. I think he’s gone mad at this point in his life.
I calling it. Jamie Lee Cutis character dies.
Director of Halloween kills : how many killcount you guys want Michael Myers do!?  Fans : Yes.. Bloody Yes..
I’ve never watched a Halloween movie but god damn I wanna watch this
Nice, just show half the kills
I know Michael always kills, but I think after he was left for dead by the Strode women he must’ve been pissed and goes hell bent. “There’s a new kind of mean in him. He is angry and he is hunting.”
God damn this looks good.  Just another reason to look forward to October.
This is mayhem
Finally, Tier 4 Michael Myers
HALLOWEEN 3 MASKS! SILVER SHAMROCK
WOW 😳😲😎👍👍👍
This is looks incredible and looks much better that the first film but with new visual, new action and blood and much best looking horror film.  I so hyped for this. It is going to be much improved that first movie that the it looks like that.
Michael myers: i always come back! Springtrap: am i a joke to you
1:32 (1982) Halloween 3 reference. That's why we don't talk about it.
Halloween Short Film - HE CAME HOME - 🎃🔪- https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vDMJEoM3TgQ&t=2s
Halloween Short Film - HE CAME HOME - 🎃🔪- https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vDMJEoM3TgQ&t=2s
I wanted to watch it till the end but I just worry that there will be too many spoilers
2:19 someone hits michael myers from the back
Ohhhhh!   this looks soooo goood!
Halloween Short Film - HE CAME HOME - 🎃🔪- https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vDMJEoM3TgQ&t=2s
Finish him already!!!!!
John Wick is going after Michael Myers who when he heard John Wick was after him. Killed himself and ran straight to hell. Michael Myers thought he was safe in hell until John Wick show up
Is this Michael Myers or John Wick?
I going to watch for free....
I miss trailers that give you just enough- not the whole film ffs. It seems to be a skill missing in Hollywood these days.
This Halloween Michael returns .. this will be really cool the watch I can’t wait. .. I think they’re making one more right after this one but it won’t be in till 2024 .. end it will be the last one of Halloween. ..
🥱 another crappy Hollywood sequel
Tamil dub plz
I honestly just clicked to be in the comment section . Lol me and the wife are FRICK-A STOKED!
Showing WAY too much of the movie!!!
Wait another one?
Michael is a f*****g killing machine!!!!
Finally someone acknowledging the existence of Halloween 3 ffs
Those firefighters were a bunch of idiots letting him get his Tier 3 so quickly
See this is what makes the Halloween films so stupid. Michael Myers is human and would have been dead a long time ago
Is that Catfish from Always Sunny?
So basically a more action packed version of Halloween 4 when the townspeople form a lynch mob to go after him.
Where is Punisher when you need him the most
bruh
We already knew he wasn't dead,but shit he got more intense!! 😐 he not even angry anymore he's gone beyond that. This will be interesting 😁
Not gonna Lie This Looks Brutal Violence Than the others Sequels.
This looks really good and all, taking the fight to the evil killer, but that's also exactly what the last movie was supposed to be. And since they need Michael to survive, everyone just ended up comically incompetent.
I hope the entire town hunting down Michael is actually in the movie and isn't just the trailer cut to be misleading. Because a serial killer taking on an army of people actively hunting him down is a slasher-horror concept I've wanted to see for a very long time.
oh.... HELL YEAH
2:17 Allyson: “Do it…DO IT!”  Micheal: “Very poor choice of words”
I absolutely love how they incorporated the silver shamrock masks. Maybe a sign at a future project??
Lázaro is the new Michael Myers in Brazil
I actually regret watching this trailer. It showed way too many of the kills. I know there will be more in this movie but why show so many of the deaths in the trailer
The more he kills the more he transcends WTF IS HE SEPHIROTH???
YES LETS GO!
This feels too forced
Dam show all the kills before the movie comes out sure. Wtf man
1:33 and 1:37 look like mask from Halloween 3
This is literally the whole movie they left nothing to the imagination... long story short(taylor swift voice) it's going to be shit.
Am I the only one who wants Laurie after this film to be killed by Micheal and this film she buries him alive whilst lit on fire
*chaos🔥*
Alright Lets See how they gonna win vs Michael
HELL YES
Its getting boring 🙄.
James can just do a kill count of this trailer
I knew this was gonna be great!
“Evil dies tonight.” *Knows Halloween Ends is the next* Yea good luck with killing him.
Also when will there be Micheal Myers vs Jason Voorhees
NO NO NO NO NO...
Is this the one that he finally dies in??? Nope probably not.
can’t wait!!!!!!
Damn I'm just waiting till fall arrives honestly
Micheal Myers about to get a nuclear kill streak
You know what this looks really good
Wait, is it coming out this year
Y’all done fucked up tryna kill lil old Mikey
"Evil dies tonight." Halloween Ends: "You sure about that?"
I've seen the trailer,next i read audience and critics reviews when they start reviewing it.
so great!  love Halloween! i cant wait!
Seriously!!😲😲  This man will never die... 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Here comes the redundant kill count comments
We should have know 😂😂😂 this gonna be so damn good
This man melees men.
Dude...just stop ....
I already have my hopes up for Dead Meat doing a kill count!
Thats sad he killed the firefighters that were trying to save him
This looks disjointed
1:33 Halloween 3: Season of the witch masks Easter egg !!!
michael myers stole kyle's goddamn house!
Micheal myers lives again
Michael is no longer scary like he was in the first two movies. He's basically an evil super villain now with flashy gore kills like Jason. If you dig that then cool, but it's so far off from the original concept. I don't care how much they try to tie it back to the originals with Curtis involved, it doesn't work.
Big fan of Michael myers
Wowww, now the whole town gonna end him
I seen All of the Halloween movies can't wait for this one
love the string version of the Halloween theme
alright now when it releases i will watch it in theaters and have nightmares' for 3 months
Please cinema...im hype for this one philippines please
MOST KILLS IN A SINGLE TRAILER EVER?😱😱😱
Greatest trailer of all time🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
You can’t kill evil
I saw a dude with a pumpkin on his head, reference to Season Of The Witch???
This is a brilliant idea. Instead of making horror characters stupid. Make them smart and the whole town vs Micheal Myers concept is what a group of smart people would do.
"Welcome to the Kill Count, where we tally up the victims in all our favorite horror movies."
The Silver Shamrock Masks! Yeeeeessssss!!!
Remember seeing the previous movie in theaters sitting almost alone (there were just a few more people in total) and it was awesome, i can't wait for this one!
Jesus is coming back soon, please repent!!!   •Why Salvation?: So I’m sure your probably familiar with the story of Adam and Eve, (them disobeying God, committing the original sin eating the fruit from the forbidden tree of knowledge of good and evil). Us, being their earthly descendants we are all vulnerable to temptation to sin and have sinned (sin: which is a moral flaw/crime against God). In the story of Moses, God gives what is called the moral law(the Ten Commandments) the Bible says “the wages of sin is death” breaking these laws we are punished by death/hell. We’ve all broken at least one of these commandments. So God sends Jesus(the son of God) who lives a perfect and sinless life. Jesus offers himself as a sacrifice in place of the punishment that we deserve for breaking the Moral Law. So right before Jesus passes away on the cross, he says “it is finished” which means the punishment for our sins was fulfilled. Then Jesus dies. He raises from the dead, three days later, signifying he had defeated death, which is the wages for sin.   (John 3:16) sums up why God offered his Son as a sacrifice for our sin.   ••How to get saved: Romans 10:9 “that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.”  Ask God for forgiveness, repent and ask him into your Heart and Life in the name of Jesus. Repent: to feel such regret for sins or crimes as produces amendment of life, to be sorry, regretful.  When you do this God will begin to make changes in your life, this means you are “born again” When you actually pray and try to get rid of sin your life, you’ll start to see a change. This process will last throughout you whole life if you are really committed. God knows our hearts and intentions better then we know ourselves. I hope this is a major blessing. I hope you really take into account what I said and really think and pray on these things.
I love how they reference Halloween 3: Season of the Witch with the dead bodies wearing the 3 different masks.
“It’s just one man...” No, it is not...
This shit keeps getting worse with each installment.   Shit storyline.  Unbelievable scenes. Blaaahhhh. Absolute garbage
This entire city must be purged!
I like the implication that until the firemen came Michael was just chilling in the corner to not be in the final shot of the last film, wasn't trying to escape or anything, just walked to the side
Идеально
This man bout to go innn on everyone black forces energy
SWFs are getting more toxic
I hope they didn’t show the whole movie there
🎃 🔪
Intense bruh
ALL THE HALLOWEEN 3 MASKS IM SO EXCITED
Michael’s ‘bout to kick some ass
Shit this looks good dat man Michael is on the hunt 😂💯
Micheal  is number one for most scary person
Lol i wanna watch somethin
This one looks scarier than the 2018 one!😨😬
So poorly edited.
Feels like serial killer.... N some people don't want to run away from and want to fight against it.
Ooooooo this like Halloween 4’s Michael hunt but bigger!!!
It’s Like Trevor Belmont, Sypha Belandes & Alucard (Kid Dracula) & The Rest Of The Belmont Clan From The “Castlevania” 🎮 Franchise & Netflix Horror Adult Anime Original Series Fighting 🧛🏼‍♂️ & His Endless Army Of 🌌 Creatures After His Resurrection From The ☠️ Every 100 Years! 🚿 & 🔁! 🚿 & 🔁! 🚿 & 🔁!
By the time this movie is in theaters i would be 6 months away from being 18 so i probably won't be able to watch it in theaters :(
UNA LOCURA :)
Now I’m ready! I’ve been waiting for this since last year and now it’s finally here   Happy Halloween everyone, Halloween comes early
Why do they need a mob of people when they could have just gave Busta Rhymes a call?
No one is better than uncle Mike
He always comes back
Michael is gangsta till Jason shows up...cross fingers for Michael vs Jason🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻
OOOH MY FRICKIN GOD!!!!!!! THIS MOVIE LOOOK SOOOOOO HARDDD!!!!!! AHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAH👍👍👍👍👍
Kyle Richards
I think the excessive murdering actually waters down the movie and pushes it into the cheesey category, Halloween works better when its not an over the top gorefest
Holy Shit! Can wait for this movie.
Wow, no way! He survived the last movie?!
i hate how trailers nowadays basically show you the movie in short little shots that tells you whats going to happen
Holy cow, what a soggy and bloated trailer. I don’t even need to see the movie cuz this just gave so much away, and I know part 3 is coming too. I wanted to know how he escaped the fire but not in the trailer, christ
"Fire breaks out." "Women upset at firefighters for doing their job."  🦧🦧🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
okay but i was really hoping kyle richards character would live but judging from this trailer she is absolutely gon get murked ☠️
Hey universal,                           Jurassic World dominion trialer!
Can’t fu**ing wait!!!!
So it's the entire town vs micheal?! That's a genius way of making sure this movie has a bunch of scares and kills. This movie is going to be freaking amazing.
I like how it has the 3 mask from Halloween 3 the pumpkin the skeleton and the witch
Honestly, love the Halloween 3 easter egg and hope that after this film they could finally start doing an analogy series like they originally planned on doing.
He kills the whole fire fighter crew 😳  what a Savadge
John Carpenter revealed in this movie, Michael will be the most violent and ruthless version of him that the audience will ever see. Can’t wait for this to come out it looks AMAZING!!

Michael Was Scarier When We Didn’t Know What Drived Him Crazy
Works not stopping me from October 15 I seen this on my break at work today and immediately went to ask for October 15th off I wouldn’t be surprised if I was at the theater hours early I’m sooo excited
so in this one the town is ready for smoke? i cant wait!
Starting to get a little on the woke side
I felt this would be the final chapter of Halloween franchise. From the first Halloween, Halloween 2 and Halloween(2018), ignoring other sequels after Halloween 2.   That's my opinion about this.
I like the Halloween 3 reference
Well it looks like the whole town is coming together to take on Michael 🔪 🎃😱
Me and my ex made plans to see this when we were together....I miss him...
The whole town vs Michael, wow they must really want to die
I loved the easter egg for Season of the Witch
HOLY SHIT
Too much trailer for me. Save some for the actual movies
First of all they showed too much. Also it looks like they're going for a more gory film like the Rob Zombie ones and when you do something like that you run the risk of losing the subtlety and natural horror of the original. I love Gore in my horror movies but sometimes especially with a series like Halloween less-is-more.
again?!
Whoever pissed off Michael Myers should go and apologize 😂
This isnt a murder story its a War
Epic tarlior
OH SHIT! I love Myers!
Yeah so let's just go ahead and show every death in the trailer...
The third commercial, it's still on, please, take off the third channel, the third channel, it's still running, stop it, please, for god's sake, please stop it, there's no more time, you've got to--please stop it, stop it now, turn it off, turn it off, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, STOP IIIIIIIIIIT!!!!!
Omg now waiting for this movie. I like Michael Myers. And this it's the final confrontation with Michael and Laurie
. Michael myer only work in festive season halloween  trailer is good I think this movie is continuation of Halloween 2018
I waited 4 years for this movie
James A. Janniese: Yey, more kills...
Michael caught more bodies in this trailer than he has in the entire franchise! 🤣 This dude going off this movie!
OK. Show of hands class.. how many of you were shocked Myers survived the fire?
Seems like they gave a lot of the movie away
Halloween a retirement home final wish, I do not know at this point hahaha
This Halloween is no longer a holiday... But now... It has become an war...
Sleeping with the lights on tonight
I want to see either Michael's backstory on this timeline, Michael's face, or Michael to say something.  and of course I want to see him die at the end for a nice satisfying way, because he never truly died in any of the timelines, except for the rob zombie Halloween movies.
Finally, a full (and technically real) trailer! Absolutely HYPED!
Boy im comeing back
Michael is just Jason at this point.
Laurie Strode: LET IT BURN!!! Firefighters: Hey! I know that song! WE DON'T NEED NO WATER! LET THAT MOTHERFUCKER BURN!
The body count is high
I love the Halloween 3 references!!
*sigh*   this looks pretty uninspiring.   The thing that made Carpenter's original work so well is that he and Debra Hill offered no answers to any questions raised by why 6 Michael became The  Shape.   That's what made it so effective.  As soon as you start attempting to explain things or delve deeper into the mythology of who/what Michael is, it all falls apart.
This is gonna be Epic 100% badass
I’m excited about it 🙌🏼🎃
This seems like a pretty fitting conclusion for a sequel, but we all know there’s gonna be a third and final one, which is the real conclusion, so I’m honestly curious to see how that shapes out in the end
Holy shit....firefighters today are pussies....a 60 year old man killed the whole battalion!!  bet they regret lowering the fitness standards now!
This slow walk man will kill lots of people? Common are you kidding me?? boring, and dump..
I'm so sad 😞 my channel no views
It seems like the whole town is sick of Michael's bullshit and is ready to literally hunt him down xD
Aw man I definitely want to watch this!
The sad thing is.. my mom hates Halloween and she dont will live me whatch this movie in the teatrel   Porque mãe porque?
Way to ruin the intro of the movie by showing WAY to much! I had to stop this to not spoil anymore. Damn Universal! Leave some to the imagination
They should add Michael Myers to fort nite this Halloween like if it’s a good idea
Evil dies tonight... But gets better by tomorrow.
Oh hell yes
Wish i could watch it with my step mom like we used to do with halloween movies but they separated and she never talked to me again😔
Life Lesson: Don't exist in Haddonfield
*Everybody asked how I got out of the trap, yet nobody believed what I typed about the hole Laurie made with her gunshot!*
This guy never dies. Like seriously. Odd thing is I ain't ever seen an asian person in these movies, is he afraid of asians?
It’s about time they released the trailer.
Damn he’s back again respect
I mean she cut his head clean off on Halloween H20, and it somehow found its way back to the body, if I was her id just give up lol
The end where laurie is holding the knife must be the end of the movie
lazaro: o filme
Does anyone think it’s insane for all of the firemen to die against Michael Myers. These men are strong and train a ton to protect themselves.
Gay
Michael Myers when he tier 3
Pero para que voy a ver la peli si ya me la enseñaron toda en el trailer?  XD
Noone wanna talk about dope theme song?!
Michael Myers is finally fuckin unhinged ( I mean he was always a serial killer) but to see him going on a murder rampage on a whole town means he’s fully hit rock bottom he doesn’t mercy save people anymore he’s hell bent on destruction about killing the strode family
Now that’s a fucking trailer. YES! Halloween Kills bout to have the highest kill count ever. Get ready 🔪
James A. Janniese is currently sweating BULLETS thinking about this kill count
Evil dies...till the next 12 movies 😌
Awesome !!! Waiting for this since long..more aggressive note gruesome..
oh oh oh OH HELL YES
Finally 🔥
🏃🚄💨💨💨 coming!
Damn that mask dope af I already ordered it in the mail I'm so hyped
0:30 It was at that moment, those firefighters realized. . . THEY FUCKED UP
Can he beat Goku tho???
1:33 Oh hey a reference to Season of the Witch with the masks
Woohoo! Finally!
Damn I thought it was over
That trailer was the entire movie 😐
And this movie will showcase why Michael is superior to Jason in every category lol. 🔪
oh my god i cant wait to watch that scene where Michael walks out of the burning house and slaughters the firefighters
As a longtime Halloween fan this trailer gave me fucking chills!!! Looks SO HYPE!!!!
What I hate is that the third movie was already announced, so we already know how this will end.
Why do I get the feeling the beginning of the film where Michael annihilates the firefighters is gonna be one of the best parts of the film? Not saying the rest will be bad by any means. The whole film looks awesome. But judging from the shots in this trailer, they won't be holding back in that moment. That shot at 0:38 is ESPECIALLY badass.
1963, loomis warned the board about Myers’s condition and no one listened, people died in 1978 even 40 years of built up hate and evil, all it took was a transfer to let him express his hate, no one listened and  now theyre paying for it
1:32 SILVER SHAMROCK!
What kind of trailer is this? Its a movie recap
Holy crap this looks incredible
The town thinks they’re gonna hunt him, how the tables will turn…
I honestly think halloween ends will have the most kill count but the way this is looking it's gonna be close
Whole town vs micheal myers
i can't wait!!! wooot!
Does this not get tiring at this point? Im a diehard fan of the halloween sequels but even this is just getting old. Not tryna get haters on my tail or anything.
All that's missing is Michael listening to 'let the bodies hit the floor' behind that mask!
This film looks like it's going to kick a lot of ass!
Mikey=STILL in action 43 years later.
I felt like they show too much mayhem in the trailer. Hopefully the kills be more brutal then off screen like the 2018 one
I already see it.  33% rotten tomatoes
"LET HIM BURN!"
Holy shit.
Let this franchise burn Jesus
"Evil dies tonight!"    Oh fuck yes lady!!!!
I'm crying right now. Now I have another reason to keep myself alive until premiere.
I love you, Laurie Strode!!!
wicked
Una razón más para estar vivo
Hey Michae is back🔥🔥
How... Just how?
🔥🔥🔥🔥
The trailer revealed way too much. A lot of the best kills were spoiled!
This movie looks awesome!!
Micheal Myers isn’t human
Well he's very angry in this damn he's got mad kills
That fire just gave him an upgrade 🤣🥱
One mask to rule them all...
michael myers really bouta pull a madara uchiha on the whole town of haddonfield this movie
Dang is he gonna kill the whole village now cuz the kill count in the trailer is 12+
Movie: "Evil dies tonight."  Blumhouse: *makes a sequel*
Damn the black people die in the trailers now smh. Can't even make it to the theater
I actually like the idea of the townspeople hunting Michael , and Michael killing one by one
Dead meat where you at?
Did this trailer just show the entire movie 😭😭
So glad we are getting Halloween series cleaned up. 4 wasn't bad but 5 was damn near the same movie all over again. 6 was terrible unless you see the producers cut. Even then continuity of the Halloween series has been terrible.
Michaels Kill count = 1,000
I always find it funny when the studios only see dollar signs after a movie becomes successful. Even when they put a button on the last one, they just had to make another sequel. It's like when Jason Statham "died" in Crank and then Crank 2 came out.
Top 5 things that would kill Michael Myers for good. 1. Ant-man goes up Myers ass then turn to giant man. 2. A tactical nuke at point blank range. 3 the death stars super laser. 4.stick his head in a microwave and set it for mash potato. 5.drop a acme safe on his head and hope he doesn't have a umbrella.
The best line in this is “he’s the essence of evil.”
Michael Myers is a curse, cursed to kill his entire family.
Nice spoiler.
How woke will this be??
PUTA Q ME PARIIIIIIIIIIIUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU VO CAGA NAS CALCAS
if you want to really get rid of Michael and i mean REALLY you gotta release his tweets and cancel him
Hopefully i survive this Halloween sequel
Tubelight scene was terrifying 😭😭😭
2:18...SPOOKY Donald Trump! 🎃🔪
OH MY GOD !!!!!!  What a awesome freaking insane trailer i really got goosebumps and lot of jaw drop  I really like how Michael is getting more brutal and finding new way to kill people (i was like geeez Michael  !!!!!)  And i got the feeling that Michael is going to kill laurie fellowers or group whatever   This movie is going to be a bloodthirsty Halloween movie of October!!!!  Thanks for 100 likes guys
Hell no this nigga done killed the firefighters
silver shamrock mask from halloween 3 lol
2021 cinema plot twist; *Laurie chases Michael upstairs.*
Halloween Kills huh? 🤔  So then he didn’t get the Covid 19 Vaccine, but then again he does wear a mask and keep his distance, just until he kills 🔪 😄
When will they fucking learn? My man is basically William Afton.
Holy shit...the murdered victims wearing those Silver Shamrock Masks...paying homage to Halloween 3
I love this idea. It tackles how Michael is just blatantly unkillable
Oh my
Dead by daylight vibes🔥🔥🔥
Michael Myers: Parabellum
Best Serial Killer EVEEEER ❤🧡
18, 2021
"Evil dies tonight" Until the next movie when he magically comes back to life
I’m so hyped
Every Michael Myers movie: So how many times do you wanna die   Michael Myers:Yes
This is what we all have been waiting for.   After this trailer, I hope there's no more. Let this be it, no more clips please.  Otherwise, the movie will be ruined.
This gonna be on hbo max?
Omg ... 🙊 Esto es épico 🎃
Saw the season of the witch masks..maybe they will try and tie in the spirit of Samhain somehow and it sort of explain how he cant die and has supernatural abilities on Halloween. Sort of combine season of the witch and curse of michael meyers all in one.
THE SHAMROCK MASKS!!!!! 🍀💀🎃🧙‍♀️
Cant fuckin wait
i’ll never forget how the whole theater was like the first time we all watched the 2018 version. i took this girl i had just met on a dating app and we decided to watch it. the whole theater ,audience and my life was like a movie for those whole few hours. Nothing better than the girl of your dreams beside you, and the audience all having fun laughing at the jokes in the movie and also scared of not knowing what would happen next. all dealing with their fear in their own way. a lot of comments a lot of talking lol 😂 straight hood shit like outta the scary movie theater seen lol. was so much fun i’ll never forget it! blume house Universal and miramax made this movie epic. can’t wait to take my baddie to the next one
the shape returns
What's the runtime
He better not die in the 3rd film
I have a gut feeling that Laurie strode dies in this film
so stoked for this. i love how much passion the filmmakers bring to these new movies. their love for the original, and horror movies in general, is apparent in every shot
In real life those MANY FIRE MEN would attack at the same time and kill jason...
hope they kill off laurie though
They are legend who watching during online classes 😂😄🤣
I knew he wasn’t dead man my boy Michael better kill everybody I hope he do
Im too excited!!!!
Mike Myers it's back in black 😂😂
Ok. Geeked 🥸
Can we get seal team six to put this guy down once & for all
“HE IS THE ESSENCE OF EVIL.” That’s a great line from this trailer, get ready for this “HALLOWEEN” because its gonna “KILLS”
Can we just appreciate how they gave Michael a more realistic scenario on how he escaped the fire rather than just walking out of the flames like a zombie or waking up at the morgue.
Lmao making firefighters seem useless when they are the best people we have. Also another "oh nobody told you" scenario. Fuck off with your kindergarten narrative this is trash already.
i have bern waiting for this movie to come out since last year!!! I CANT WAIT FOR THIS TO COME OUT AAAHHH!!
I thought that October was my favorite month bc of my bday...but now I know it's bc of HALLOWEEN 🎃 🤪!!!!!
I stopped at 0:27 these trailers always show way tooooo much.   Fuck that shit
“I met him, fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left. No reason, no conscience, no understanding; even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, good or evil, right or wrong. I met this six-year-old child, with this blank, pale, emotionless face and, the blackest eyes... the *devil's* eyes.”
idk if I can watch this in theaters, the 1st one was so grossly violent I couldn’t deal
1:34 the masks from Halloween 3 !!!
1:35 season of the witch Easter egg.
Wish they didn’t show as many of the kills. Still excited tho.
Nice reference to the 3rd film with the masks he put on those bodies in the playground there the entire Silver Shamrock product line. They made one other mask Shatner possessed by the Devil's Rain.
Michael Myers survives a fire and all of the towns people start to fight back? This ain’t a horror movie anymore…it’s a war.
I can't wait for James to get the kills
He's way more mad than he's ever been!!
https://youtu.be/R3P9LzSg9e0
He got tombstone fr
1:45 that music  though
Good luck to James trying to count this many kills in the dark. From the trailer, it's also probably going to be a high body movie too, or at the very least the highest in the franchise.
Re4 as a villain instead of Leon lol sick
Might as well call the avengers for him at this point
Fuck amazing
Guess I’ll b hitting the theaters
THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD. It's like an action or superhero movie trailer. IDK but NO
Michael on GOD Mode!!! So pumped up for this.🤩🤯
Yes Yes Yes
YES!!! finally a wholesome christian family movie!
Wow this shit is still going ffs what a waste of time and money
Myers is not displeasing the entity
1:46 Congenital Insensitivity to Pain (CIP) don't make him supernatural again, every non Jamie Lee Curtis Halloween sucked. Resurrection doesn't count, it never happened.
Not even finna watch it... Just wanna see that Dead Meat killcount. 🍖
🔥🎃🔪
Evil has come to your little town, sheriff. - Dr. Samuel Loomis, 1978.  Just imagine the wordplay Sam would use when describing Michael Myers in 2021 after the horrid things he's done up to this point in time.
Will Michael Myers ever die ?  Seems as though he is immortal.  Maybe this will be the end of him.  It should be changed to Halloween Kills Michael Myers.
Geez I hope this is it, like the final movie where he just fucking dies and doesn’t come back. I do like that it looks like the town has had enough of this shit too lol finally.
So excited!!
This time... people of this town is ready to fight back
I LOVE the HALLOWEEN 3: season of the witch reference(the witch,skeleton and pumpkin masks)1:31 to 1:39
Oh I am HYPED to watch this in theaters
Somebody send this to James A Janisse he's going be hyped!
James get ready to count the whole town's population
Respect Michael Myers <3
claim your one hour ticket here.
YESSSSS MY FAVVVV
When does this come out???
Gawd damn I am excited for this
I can't wait
These are the type of horror movies i enjoy, not the easy "jump scare" crap that is constantly produced. A good old hack and slash with some mental play is a nice relief IMO.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
He's back! He's back! The King of Halloween is back!
Michael is killing people like Jason.  Come on Hollywood make the Michael vs Jason Movie. It would be epic and make it Extremely Rated R
So this movie is just the continuation of Halloween?
Michael is like a terminator, he just doesn’t die…
Whys it so hard to kill one guy :/
Showed a lot. lets hope this is not the whole movie like Halloween 2018
First Shang chi and the legend of the ten rings & now Halloween kills? This is gonna be epic!
Um I  thought he was supposed to be human well it looks like they lied again
It’s like I saw the entire movie in the trailer….🤦🏾‍♂️
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They’re showing all the best parts
Killing a bunch of firemen…. Pretty low for content
Look, I know trailers being spoileriffic isn't a new thing but this is egregiously bad.
Good trailer now let's make "The 13th Friday!"
I hope this movie will show us about Michael’s perspective
Myer the one that scared me much after Freddy Cruger 👊👊👊
Ayo another mediocre dragged out slasher film
holy shit it's dope asf 🔥🔥🔥🔥 can't wait to see this movie
Lo bueno, es que se ve que está será mejor que la primera. Lo malo es que ya sabemos quiénes van a morir
Who's catching the midnight show? 🤗
I think the end of the movie is Laurie escaping the hospital, going after Michael because he killed either her daughter or granddaughter and that will set up Halloween Ends
just can't wait
Michael is coming back!!! WOO-HOO!!
See Michal just ruined this dudes whole career
Ey Silver Shamrock Masks!
I hope that neither laurie nor her daughter nor her granddaughter dies but there are 3 in vain for the second
“In order to appease the gods, the Druid priests held fire rituals. Prisoners of war, criminals, the insane, animals were burned alive in baskets. By observing the way they died, the Druids believed they could see omens of the future. Two thousand years later, we've come no further. Samhain isn't evil spirits. It isn't goblins, ghosts or witches. It's the unconscious mind. We're all afraid of the dark inside ourselves.”
THATs how you do a movie trailer
OH YEAH!!!
ONE YEAR DELAY BUT LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
Pfft... thanks firefighters!
Compromise time: I'll go see it if you stop fucking making these movies.
Holy shit who's gonna be left?
finally another HUGE body count for Dead Meat to count on the kill count!
This trailer spoil one of a main side character death Lindsey
Repent and get right with GOD before it’s too late, transfer your trust from yourself to the SAVIOR
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😳😳😳😳😳😳
that was fucking awesome. can't wait for the movie!
I’m not watching this but I’ll watch James A Janise kill count it
Halloween Kills Jeepers Creepers Reborn Candyman  Venom 2 Resident Evil Reboot A Quiet Place II Chucky TV series Texas Chainsaw Massacre  Wow 2021 is the year for horror
Love it my favorite horror series
So we meet again 😌
Holy fucken shit😮🔥🔥🔥
This shit look stupid lmao
He looks so badass in this trailer
😱😱😱😱 Best Halloween Trailer Ever
Just showed the entire movie in this trailer
I’ve been waiting for this
Hear me out, Michael vs Michael vs Michael. From different movies, who will prevail.
as a firefighter i don't know what i would do if i saw myers in a structure fire 😳
I'm excited for Venom Let There Be Carnage
This man just chilling in creative mode
Man I am so excited for this shit. I honestly believe this one will be one of the best ones they've made.
This is getting serious damn
2:12 same as Halloween 4
Jesus whoever edited this trailer give him or her a raise!
Michael using a buzzsaw, YEEEEEEEHAW! Can’t wait
Sheesh Michael Myers is back
Awesome trailer!! This is definitely the most violent Michael has ever been.. My only nitpick is that I think Laurie and her family are coming off a little too “Femme Fatale” it’s almost like they’re not afraid at all, which diminishes Michael’s fear factor a little bit.. Like He’s literally sleeping Slaughtering legions of grown men yet these 3 scrawny chicks are pulling his card.. Still looks great though, I’m excited!
James A Janisse is gonna have a field day with this.
These movies are getting so dumb! I don't buy it
*Ahh Shit, Here We Go Again* 🎃
I guess Marion won't make it out alive this time...again :'c
This looks so over the top dumb😂😂😂but imma still watch best believe
This straight up got recommended for me and I'm surprised to see this. Another Halloween Movie and then a few months later, A kill count from Dead Meat.
They should've had him change cloths instead of killing the fire fighters, Micheal Myers blends into society as shown in previous movies, making him truly terrifying when you know hes offset in a corner unknown to the victim!!!!!!!!!!   Wwwwwwwwhhhhhhhhhyyyyyyyyyyyyy They wrecked Michael Myers  YOU DID IT  YOU RUINED HOLLOWEEN
Am I missing something? He's. Just. A. Man!!!
Turtle
I love that little nod to Halloween 4 where Michael pins the ex boyfriend to the wall in it what appears to be on a stair case.
Gonna be one of the best kill counts on DeadMeat
Chuck Norris, you got some competition coming 😁
Dude they spoiled so many kills
This looks good...
Let's go
They really just showed all the damn kills in the trailer.. way to ruin the movie for us 🙄
This Michael Meyers got Tombstone Build on crack, watch the entity going to do a cameo
I like the halloween 3 masks in there but shouldnt have shown it..WTF
DAAAAAAMMMMMMNNNN!!! For a Halloween movie, this looks badass!!!
As soon as the franchise gets somewhat back on track, they go back to this rediculous bull crap. It wasn't enough that he survived a burning building, now his old azz is taking down whole fire forces!? Like come on man. 🤦🤦🤦
Evil. Is. Pissed
Wow really thought it was a older trailer 😱. Then I saw released an hour ago. Finally early!
Holy shit…
This looks like another desperate attempt to pander to fans and they'll eat it up because Michael is "EvilLlLlLlL". I'm sure the decision to remove suspense and replace it with a John Wick body count will be great. ..  Jamie's line delivery is also pretty bad here. Worse than the last movie.
this will be GORY HALLOWEEN
Karen to Michael:   I'd like to speak to your manager about me being murdered
Can’t wait for the kill count
Rip fireman
LETS FREAKING GOOOOOO  😈☠🔥🎃🍬
I loved it but they showed to much
Went from a whole camping site. To a whole town.
Is it releasing in India  Excited to watch this movie in theatre ❤️
At the end of the movie , we all know who wins and rises back up....... Michael, he never dies........ until jammie lee curtis is like 100 years old and on a wheel chair, then maybe this series will end.
Broooo this looks mint
So...he is LITERALLY supernatural now? YAWN.
I don't think that it could be the good movie. Halloween 1977 was better.
Well he will survive again
Oh hell yeah that's going to be so good I can't wait to see this movie  And that explains how they are able to have an movie and why the last movie wasn't the end of the saga and how Michael Myers survived from the last movie  I have heard that they are planning to have at least 2 to 3 more Halloween movies at Halloween Kills that this won't be the end of the Halloween saga I have also heard a rumor that Jaime Lee Curtis's character Lori Strobe doesn't make it to the end of Halloween Kills that she is going to die in this movie but that's just a rumor so I guess we will have to wait and see 🤷🏼‍♂️
This shit looks fucking fire no pun intended
Insert dbd jokes here*
Halloween Kills, The Conjuring 3, A Quiet Place 2, Jeepers Creepers 4, Orphan 2, Candyman, Scream 5, Chucky's TV series, new The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Final Destination 6 coming soon ...it's a good time for horror fans, i'm loving it
This Move Is Gonna Make A Killer At The Box Office!!!!
Damn these going to crazy sequel! Whole town vs Michael Myers
Not gonna lie, this actually looks kind of epic
Love the Halloween 3 easter egg.
please stop , this is worse than the fast and furious franchise now....
He better be killing more than the people in this trailer because they showed so many
Can’t wait to watch it and perhaps the sequel Halloween ends in 2022
I’m praying they didn’t take any of these scenes out of the final version of this like they did with 2018. But I’m HYPED ASF!!!!!!!
Wow anthers one. 🙃
stopped watching the trailer half way because they are revealing every single kill.. bro wtf!! Why do trailers do this!?!? Just tease! Don't give me the whole thing already!
THIS LOOKS FIREEEEE
movie looks amazing but they definitely showed too much in the trailer
Evil Never Dies
He's actually terrifying, exiting the house like it's nothing. I can't wait to see this movie
Honestly, I feel like I’m going to be hunted for this(heh get it cause the trailer) but this may be Michael at his most intimidating(at least for me)
0:37 The green screen or special effects look terrible. Doesnt look like something from a major motion picture
It's easy to  say they picked the perfect director's cast and crew to give Halloween the ending this franchise deserves  camt wait I got chills watching this
how is he going to “die” this time
MY TIP ISSS SOOO STICKYYY RN !!!!
SOMEBODY ALERT DEAD MEAT!
OMFG THIS IS GONNA BE CRAZY
I'm rooting for Michael to kill the whole town
I really jus need a chance to be heard I'm not asking for 🎵🎼handouts I'm willin to grind I see a beautiful body of work I can't wait to express jus lack the attention I kno I'm capable of making my something u like chance me please I really appreciate ur time gods and goddesses distant fam asé.
blah. showed way too many kills. showed too much of what the confrontations will be. awful giveaways. no suspense whatsoever.
Okay but am i the only one who thinks they showed alil too much in this trailer😭
This ain’t Halloween anymore. They going to far
I would only hate myself if I did give up 🎼💣🎵 Sometimes I feel like I'm not enough 6ut I don't ever feel like quiting  Workin on my self everyday I have no place to speak 6ad on no 1 I'm not perfect 6ut I love trying 🎵🎼
ill be honest i didnt want there to be a new Halloween but this one doesnt looks so bad
She cut his head off in the one movie, but he’s human? I wanna see another Jason and another Freddy...then have Jason vs Freddy, act as if the first one doesn’t exist.
Ho---ly..shit....AWESOME!!!!
jamie lee curtis is such a bad ass, and kyle richards OMG! cant wait to see this movie
This trailer was all over place. But still looks decent
I prefer non-violent resolution of conflict
Hey, it's Creighton Duke!
I couldn’t be more excited
Can't wait to see Dead Meat Cover this!
First off we are long over due for a violin version of the Halloween theme. 2nd of all... cannot wait this looks like the best of all the Halloween movies cannot wait!
I cannot wait! October needs to be here ASAP!
Halloween 3 references is coolest idea dudes!
I am so pumped for this shit! 🎃
Michael vs the whole town   That's gonna be epic
Michael Myers can take on the hole us army, without any shots Fire
Wasn’t she dead already?. Michael killed her. How many movies ??? 6-7???? This is just tooooooo much
This is what im fuckin talking about!!! give me all the subtle gore 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Dead Meat: Aw shit, here we go again…
Reminds me of that Darth Vader quote: *All I am surrounded by is fear. And dead men.*
Omg I'm so fucking hyped up I'm so excited 😁😆
He is gonna die in this One? Oe nah
There’s no way they kill off Allyson like wtf
FINALLY!!!
I feel like they just made Micheal Meyers about empowerment.
Hell yeah
@deadmeat
Yesssss
Bruh why they put out this heat it's already hot outside sheesh
it's 2:30 of a 2 hour movie.....  and, John Carpenter teased a massive amount of fatalities.  Trust me, we've only seen a fraction of the brutality in this movie.
1:12 THAT SHIT SCARED THE FUCK OUT OF ME!!!
Okay, an enemy at John Wick's level
This better be the final one for sure
Ya la quiero ver
His clothes didn't burn and his mask didn't melt?
Finallly!
I wasn't hike fullest movie as much cuz I think they should have done a sequel to that really but this really gets me hyped
Excited to see it but this trailer showed way too much
Lol, I like the Season of the witch Easter egg! "Silver Shamrock!"
Army? Police? CIA?, oh well logic do not work here
Love the Halloween 3 mask Easter egg there
Michael's new movies will probably be the best and most brutal of his entire saga !!! I already want to see it
yessssssss
Omg cant wait to see this one looks awesome
tu é foda John Carpenter
Anyone else get the reference to Halloween 3?
EVIL WILL RETURN THIS HALLOWEEN!!!!🎃
He just won’t die.
Micheal myers set in the hood wouldn’t no more than ten minutes
Looks like it's all out war in Haddonfield. But holy crap, it feels like the trailer just spoiled over half the kills.
Burger King Myers after you eat at McDonald’s.
My exact words when I saw this were oh my god
Michael Myers vs Jason Voorhees !!! Come on man.. You guys can do it!!
This looks fucking sickkkkk
Amazing!
Holy shit! The kill count of this movie looks FUCKING NUTS! HOLY FUCK!
Can we talk about the 🎻 for the score! Epic
Jeez mann the only thing that could stop Michael is the guy from resurrection giving him a karate kick
Halloween infinity war
It might’ve show a little too much but I don’t care. This looks so damn good. An angry mob vs Michael Myers? Sign me the fuck up for that!
Waiting
Well I hope it's better than the last one, that was horrible. Same director I noticed, probably stuff it up.
It was killed after remake after remake..
assuming this trilogy is a sendoff for the character at least for many years....I really don't have a problem with michael "spreading his wings" as far as his brutality goes....he's gotta make up for lost time
Hail yes🔥
Just noticed, the dead couple on the merry-go-round is the couple we saw in the long shot take in the 2018 one.
So basically Michael Myers goes Sicko mode
We can only rely on one person for this kill count. DEAD MEAT
This nigga been a OG since before my parents met in which was like in the late 80s or some shiit
I'm actually hyped as hell for this. This looks more like a violent fucking movie where everyone days and no one is safe. And I doubt Michael will be gone forever but dam I want this women to stop him.
Once I saw this I immediately told my girlfriend I have a date planned for us
Fun fact: Michaels mask is a Captain Kirk mask painted white.
Halloween 3 Easter Egg at 1:32
I feel like I saw the whole movie lol!
Love it when the whole town comes togethers ❤ and kill the boogieman, better then any discussion on bingo night
Where's the police? If this guy's such a monster, why's the army not getting involved?  I never understood the popularity of this franchise growing up and it still looks so pointless.
This is giving me massive Halloween 4 vibes.
Jason is better
Another trailer that gives everything  away !  Guss i dont need to see the movie now......
Does this story really matter if Michael will still survive? Lmao
I'm also coming to see you Michael in theatre
Dam.  This is a long trailer...
As usual. Too much. Trailers don’t need to be this damn long.
I bet he won’t die till the third one
THIS LOOKS GOOD AS HELL I CANT WAIT
This is where the fun begins
2:17. I'm going to be absolutely pissed off if Alyson dies in this movie
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. The purpose of michael Myers is he kills people and people are scared. BUT IN THIS MOVIE, people are gona unite and stand up to Michael and hunt him down....?.... this movie about to be ruined. REAL FANS WANT TI BE SCARED OF MICHAEL, NOT HAVE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE BEAT HIM UP. So now Michael is gona be the scared one ?????
Hey if you guys love Halloween stuff and if you guys live in Orlando. Come to cocktails and screams you will love it it's a year-round Halloween bar and yours truly dresses up as Michael Myers and I'm there every Friday and Saturday you will love the experience
Can’t wait for the movie
Wonder how the silver shamrock masks are gonna play a part or maybe it’s just giving Halloween 3 a nod
Wtf. All that fire his mask didn't burn huh
James a Janisse I’m ready for you
This shit looks dope
Dude got revenge on the Halloween 3 mask kids for not letting him have a lot of screen time in the third movie
Wait why were the masks from Halloween 3 here
No no mo nejdodnf
Laurie Strode looks like shes “wigging” out here a bit though. And wow. Who knew? Tommy Doyle got kinda sexy!
Doesn’t the shot where he’s standing in front of the house look like a really bad green screen background?
The amount of stuff coming this year this year has been awesome for me
Looks like everyone else is becoming Michael... I LOVE IT.
Why show the kills? Smack whoever greenlit this trailer.
Is it kinda weird that I want to see Michael kill everyone who wants to kill him?
Showing way too much. Less is more. The last movie had more mysterious trailer. Stop showing all the kills please.
Im this is Soo cool I hope Michel Myers survives
Please don't fucking ruin this.
They forgot to do a double tap
This trailer releases:  Dead meat: god dammit here we go again
1:33 halloween 3 refrence?
It's an interesting idea. If only we didn't know there would be a third one, we could be even more invested
I love how Michael's victims will actually be fighting back and it's the entire town versus him
Awesome! But I think I just saw the entire movie 😐
I think the brutality of this new shape really strays away of the true essence of the original... He was creepy cuz he'd sneak and stalk and really take his time while creeping from the shadows and not just going for brutal kills and mass destruction like Jason and other slashers... He only killed 4 or 5 ppl in the 1st but the suspense and mystery about him made it more of a true horror film than a slasher and while he looks great in these new ones i think they show too much in the trailers and have abandoned what made the first one feel so unnerving
Can't wait for this finally got a full length trailer!
Get ready to watch em destroy another franchise… looks like a woke pile of garbage to me. 😂🤦‍♂️✋🛑
if this movie is bad, imma cry
The hype is real October seems so far away
Spoiler alert: he won't die in this either. There's one more film in the franchise, halloween ends
Laurie: Evil Dies Tonight....  Michael: You will....
Bruh it’s June
MICHAEL MYER WTFFFFF
I swear if this old lady beats Michael I’m going to be pissed, ain’t no way that little bih has a chance against a walking demon, I want to see Jaime Lee get the stick fr
1:33 nice reference to halloween 3
Omfg finally yes
HHN maze ? 🤫🤔
the halloween 3 reference
shows too much.
I hope the music is good in this movie. One weird thing is that I couldn’t hear the original Halloween theme in the trailer (yea I know it’s amplified but I want to hear the classic piano version)
It shows too much but FUCK YEAH!!!!!!!!
Oh hell yeah.... Not even the town is enough to kill Michael!!! Long live the king of horror 🤡🎃👑
😱
Alright, where's Dead Meat?
OMG DEAD MEAT DO THIS!!!!
*Watch this new trailer THOR MOVIE* https://youtube.com/shorts/Iu7KR4SjyNw?feature=share
If a group of firefighters couldn’t take down Michael, I’m pretty sure everyone in Haddonfield is f**ked.
LETS FUCKING GO!! MIKEY IS BACK
I think they are about to break some body count records in this movie.
*Watch this new trailer THOR MOVIE* https://youtube.com/shorts/Iu7KR4SjyNw?feature=share
I’m hyped. The last one was a great return to the franchise so I hope this delivers more than just the body count
1:37 RIP nurse Marion Chambers :(
I hope it's good like 2018
They gave away 90% of the movie... Didn't all this footage.I was already amped up for this just off the title and talent alone .
Michael: is that all you got?! Brings whole town* Michael's knife: you had to ask
dam they basically showeed all the kills.  kind of ruins part of the movie no?
Swear if they don’t kill him off imma be mad. Y’all can say what y’all want about rob zombies remakes but at least he had the guts to actually kill off Michael .
I have to admit, I really disliked Halloween '18'. Thought it resembled more of a H20 type clone rather than what the makers of the film led me to believe. This, however, looks really promising.
I beg you kill him in this chapter
Hey Universal, perhaps not show every pivotal scene in your trailers. Perhaps go the original Alien route when it comes to drumming up excitement and keep it vague. Showing every kill makes the movie less scary as a result.
1:56 Reference of 1978
i think they revealed a bit too much with this trailer but the movie still looks fucking awesome i can't wait to see it
i loved the soundtrack from the last one i think this one could be even better :O
I cannot wait for this,  we all know Michael was never die
I can already hear, “Welcome to the kill count, where we tally up the victims of all our favorite horror movies.”
So Allyson is not smart enough to try to shoot Michael with the shotgun outside of his reaching distance?
That remix theme thou!
Acho que mostrou muita coisa no trailer
I feel so bad for those firemen.
This man never dies
YEAAAH
Did they just show _all_ the kills?
When will they put this series to rest?
Someone tell Dead Meat about this!!
Doctor Loomis: I met him, fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left. No reason, no conscience, no understanding; even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, good or evil, right or wrong. I met this six-year-old child, with this blank, pale, emotionless face and, the blackest eyes... the *devil's* eyes. RIP Donald 🙏
I shouldn’t be this excited oml
OOOMMMMGGG!!! This is amazing!! This is my favorite Slayer!!!
What a day. Halloween Kills and CandyMan movie trailers released back to back
Seeing firemen get killed is personally more shocking to me than seeing cops
The last movie had a good ending in my opinion but damn does this look great!
This is going be insane
Yes      Couldn't think of anything else
Did they really think they can kill Michael Myers like that...how naive
Moral of The Story: Don't save Michael Myers
Welcome to another episode of Laurie saying "he's going to die tonight" part 69
When will we get Michael vs Jason?
I really like this trailer but it’s showing way too much
THE BEST MOVIE IN THE FUCKING WORLD AND 2021 MOVIE
This actually looks like what we wanted. A bloodbath. Something 2018 was missing! Im very hyped will be going cinema oct 15th 👏
I don’t like you can see he’s whole face, please fix that like the original 1978 when he’s face is mostly hidden
"The more he kills, the more he transcends."  Doom Slayer: Heeyyy, that's MY thing.
Why don't just one of those 3'000 cast members say "Freddy Krueger" just one time. It would fix the whole damn situation.       Not on Freddy's worst day.    Psssh...  Unreal.  -Ed Bassmaster.
Their just gonna show us everything huh lol wish I didn't watch the trailer.
My goodness, save some kills for the theaters!
Spoiler alert at the end Michael picks up a rainbow flag and turns gay than Laurie puts 14 bullets in his skull
Hell yea, I can't wait for this. This looks awesome. I loved Halloween 2018.
Apocalyptica doing the music theme?
That beginning “let it burn!” Had so much emphasis. I’m excited
Take my money just take it for 100 times I don’t care take NOW
Judging from all of those kills and from how much more brutal Michael seems in this trailer, this gives me huge Rob Zombie and _The Curse of Michael Myers_ vibes. Michael was a beast in those movies, and it seems like that same viciousness will be returning here. I am so ready to see this movie! 🧡
1:32 those masks are a Halloween 2 reference
HE’S BACK!!! THE SAGA OF MICHAEL MYERS AND LAURI STRODE CONTINUES...
I hope it will be good.
Yesssssssssssssss😝😆look at my boy
This is badass trailer   In my version of a title it’s either Halloween: last blood or Halloween endgame
Nice trailer man I should see this this is going to be a blockbuster or a hit
Spoiler alert: official trailer
Hell yeah this looks so bad ass
NOW WHY IN THE F#%+ 🤣 YALLGAVE AWAY WAYYYYY TO MUCH IN THIS TRAILER!!!!
HE'S BACK!😱
I think this trailer showed to much of the movie
Michael doesn’t die!
I really excited to see this movie
Michael gotta be at least 80 years old at this point wtf
Aaahh finally, the trailer... Can't wait.
I really wanna see a Myers 1 v 3
Anyone catch the Halloween 3 Shamrock masks?
Well we don’t have to see the movie now, the trailer basically gave us everything we wanted and needed to know 🤩
Why does this actually looks really good
Actaully looks like a savage in this movie i cant wait.
Looks like Michael is back to getting all his iconic kills in
At this point I'd rather see another Rob Zombie creepfest. At least those were interesting.
And the series continues, I though for sure it was over in the last one
Can wait to see this October now
Holy fucking shit this looks amazing
i think   a new cosmatic is going to come in dbd
Ooooo
Michael Myers should become an Avanger
wow, I think you showed the whole movie. And when did Michael Myers become John Wick?
Looks like Michael Myers got those silver shamrock kids.
This is on a whole new level of its own now.
Vr. 2021
Treat for sadist 🤦🏻‍♂️
The more humanoid jason vorhees
What's the point of this type of shit we do all this canceling everything's PC now and days but yet they keep shoveling pointless violence just to feed the predominant societies bloodlust no social commentary no poignant themes just complete hedonistic violence
Michael Myers is not human.
I got to watch the whole Halloween franchise after this..
gun violence everyday in u.s but nope, they dont use gun to kill Micheal
Excited for that epic final fight with Busta Rhymes
In this film he got a Tuft of hair equipped
Yeah it was 3 Halloween mass came from Halloween 3 season from the witch
Best birthday ever 😁😁😁😁😁😁
again?
The trailer I’ve been waiting on!!
"LET HIM BURN"!!!   Wow..
From killing babysitters in the shadows to fight against firemen and a whole town.
Ooooooh shit
Personally I wont be seeing this movie dosent hit right with the fire fighters being murdered.
We all knew he was gonna survive that fire hahahah I love Michael
That old lady is playing Michael Myers 🤦🏻‍♂️
This new Terminator movie looks alright
Ha!  Season of the Witch mask references.
Omg yess they finally put out the trailer
This trailer shows WAY TOO F-ING MUCH of the film.
We not gone talk about how these niggas stood there and watched him walk out that house….😂🤦🏾‍♂️
Se ve mas emocionante que la pelea de Thanos vs los vengadores XD
There's 1 more movie after this too, can't wait.
As long as they don't try and make anything political or push an agenda im cool with this. Idk but I have a bad feeling about this movie.
I like how they even brought back minor characters like the cemetery lady & the doctor/nurse couple from the 2019 one
Good Job showing Every Kill.
I guess he hit evil within tier 3
Everyone reading have a good day and a good night
Looks like shit
Imagen it saying:Based on a true story
U should always kno Michael gone come back 😪😪😪🥴😂😂😂😂😂
So Cool💥🎃
Lázaro
Here we go I'm seeing ppl talking about they showing alot ppl ain't never satisfied 😂🤣🤣 they ain't show the whole movie y'all dam they saying this is michael Myers most movie killed ever I can't wait to see this I'm excited.
I'm still mad at the fact that they eliminated the Michael-Laurie being siblings in this timeline. It's hard for me to watch her being so attached to him and not being brothers.
yesss finaly trailer out!!
Another Halloween? To be honest I'm kinda tire of Michael Myers just kill him off already  Some reboots don't save the franchises, Friday the 13th reboot wasnt bad but didn't need to be rebooted, Nightmare of Elm street reboot buried the franchise  As for Rob Zombie's it wasn't the best but at least it ended Michael Myers so seriously just end the franchise  That's just my opinion
Excited, but I feel like they just showed so many deaths in this trailer.
I can already hear the  “Welcome to the Kill Count where we tally the victims in all our favourite horror movies.”
He may be flesh and bone but he’s definitely not a ordinary man
Awesome
🎃 🔪
Hearing Alison yelling at her Uncle to Cut her throat is beyond something else. Her scream gave me literal Chills ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Firefights doing their jobs. Laurie: NOOOOOOO!!!!!!
“Halloween 2036: just here for the money”
THIS IS HOW YOU REVIVE A FRANCHISE, DID YOU HEAR THAT TERMINATOR AND MIB?!!!!
WTF??!!! I stopped halfway through on a count of they're showing EVERYTHING!!!!! It's a Halloween movie, it sells itself! They don't need to spoil EVERY kill smh
Holy shit this is gonna be one hell of a movie I'm calling best horror movie of 2021 this is just amazing the best Halloween sequel yet hope I haven't spoken to soon when Halloween 2018 came out I was just 15 now Halloween kills coming out in 2021 and I'm 18 it's just werid how much time these movies take can't believe it's been 3 years 😃
Jesus said that hell is a place of weeping and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and where the fire is never quenched and eternal punishment and outer darkness. And the only way to escape it is to repent of your sins and have him as your Lord.
Didn't Laurie die already in one of the movies... The must've regretted letting her die in one the movies if they keep bringing her back
🎃🎃
Neighborhood-watch decides that there going to team up to take the monster down.   Michael Meyers: so you choose death ☠️
Finally he got out alive and going for a killing spree again 💀🔪😈
Can't wait to see all the crazy ways Michael kills these poor fools. A town ain't enough to stop evil incarnate.
Michael Myers reminds me of my ex gf in a way 😂
James will be happy to add this on the killcount...
They literally showed half of the movie...?
They're having a lot of trouble fighting off a 75 year old man
1:16 "stop, you had a knife in your stomach" she almost sounds bored saying it.
Nice little homage there to the underrated Halloween 3 film.
Dead Meat is Coming Im sure James is excited for this
I hope Laurie equipped Decisive Strike for this.
wow. at the beginning he killed all fire workers gruesome. this will be the best Halloween movie ever.
Didn't they just show all the kills in this trailer?
can I get a hell yea
OH MY GOD
Love the Silver Shamrock masks!!
I think soon he is come to MK11.
"this halloween" are you dumb the movie dropping 16 days before the darn day
Revealed to much
0:43 Leatherface: hold my beer
Dead meat Halloween kill (2021) I’ll get the golden chainsaw to: ? I’ll give the lame machete for: ?
When you think it's a baby Myers but he's prestige 3 with no terror radius and infinite tier 3
Wouldn’t be a surprise if Michael was a Terminator, sent back in time to kill Laurie
I turned it off a minute in cause they’re showing the whole freaking movie.
"Evil dies tonight"  *sees that they're planning one more movie next year* DOUBT
no need to fight him, just looped him between windows and pallets, he'll just kill himself from desperation
Holy shit holy shit holy shit
PLEASE PLEASE UNIVERSAL DONT FUCK THIS UP. IT HAS SO MUCH POTENTIAL.
Omg!! This was absolutely crazy! This Halloween will be nuts!!! Happy Halloween Michael 🎃
The first 2.3k comment
In the masks of halloween 3
Damn how much of the movie did they just spoil??
Don’t get discouraged because they showed multiple kills in the trailer...there will be way more to come...why would they spoil all kills?
I’m so hyped for Halloween Kills.
OH. MY. GAWDDD
Ballistic bloodshed
Hell yeah The Devil returns
This looks way more brutal than the last one
Pumped for this guys! 🎃
Did the trailer just... Show most of the people who got killed?
Simplesmente incrível..
This reminds me of halloween 4
"Not enough Abby" -IGN 1/10 (For real though this movie looks fantastic)
Just stop Laurie you can't stop Michael your done......
I really hope this movie ends for good this time
I’m hyped as hell for this
HKILLS!!!💯/💯🔪🎃 ROUND 2!!!!👊 HADDONFIELD VS. EVIL!!!!🔥
YO THE HALLOWEEN 3 MASK REFERENCE
Looks pretty direct-to-video to me
this just went from 0 to 100 real quick !!!
@citizen z
My king is back! Haddonfield royalty 👑😂
her: evil dies tonight michael: are you sure about that
Dude!!!! I love it already. Can't wait to see this film.
Da
There goes her whole plan for 40 years and part 1 out the window. Also stop showing most of the deaths in the trailer.
Funny how the didnt film this in October at all
HEELLLLLLL YEEAAAHHHH
Anybody notice the Masks on the victims were the same masks from Halloween 3?
They need to send John Wick to kill Michael Myers. Why is that. Because John Wick is who you send to kill the Boogeyman.
Woke Halloween, no thanks lol
😲🔪
Tengo el guión de la película y por lo que veo es completamente real, pinche película va estar mamalona :))
Not a fan of fan service... but seeing the Season of the Witch masks was kinda cewl.
I like it. Since this is the 2nd of the (new) trilogy (the last being Halloween Ends) I am excited to see where this goes!
The crowded aunt echographically battle because ashtray wessely prefer from a incompetent pizza. important, plant forest
Another one? Make something new, you uncreative hacks.
CAN'T FUCKING WAIT
Yo fucking proves Michael Myers is not human the shape will murder anyone I hope this film we find out  his motive to murder I know because he likes to murder but being set on fire no one can just get up from that
This one look way crazier than the first one
They basically showed the entire plot in this trailer
Aw helll yeeaahhh
1:34 reference of halloween 3
A psycho is killing every one   We are seeing this story line since a decade  Is there any new story line in this series
Bet yall can't wait for Secret Kills
Thank you 🙏
I feel like this is a action movie rather than horror movie
Loved how they used the Skull, Witch and Jack O lantern mask from Halloween 3 Season of the Witch…that was cool!
Ok looks pretty cool
Love that Season of the Witch easter egg at 1:33
Classic thriller been a while since i felt excited for a thriller
Hyped but fuck did they just show every kill scene?
Daaaaaaaaaang
I like the part where Micheal Myers dies in 1981 and there’s no more of these stupid nostalgia baits.
This trailer looks great but I just wish it didn’t show as many kills as it did. Wish that it would have just showed Michael standing in front of the firemen with a weapon rather than showing him kill them all. No suspense now lol still excited tho 😂
I wish Donald could’ve been in these new ones his dialogues were always classic
the last movie was pointless👍🏼
Halloween three reference let’s goooooo!
Gosh, How many Halloween Movies are there?
This'll be an interesting movie that's for sure
this is going to be amazing
This trailers definitely sent Michael fangirls flying.😂😂
I'm so fucking hyped
He was probably running play with your food, sloppy butcher, thanatophobia, and nurses smh and they couldn’t hear him cuz he had scratched mirror on
Can't wait! This new movies are indeed GREAT MOVIES to watch!
TAKE. MY. FUCKING. MONEY.!!!!

let's hope this is as good as the trailer makes it out to be
OH MY GODDDDD
Let's fucking goooooooo
Movie looks great, but I’m afraid like the last trailer this trailer showed wayyyy too much
This looks better than every other Michael Myeres themed Halloween film that's ever been made thus far.
1:33 Halloween 3 Season of Witch Reference 🎃
This and Shang-Chi in one night? Yeah, the movies are finally coming back!
We watched a movie reaction?
OMG let’s goooooo!
this looks really good. i can buy the whole, no let it burn, myers vs firefighters & cops, then it kind of turns into a halloween 2 thing
Halloween Short Film - HE CAME HOME - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDMJEoM3TgQ&lc=UgxwxISItekKxC9xOQp4AaABAg
3C films is going to be happy with this trailer lol
My boss returns
If only they brought Rob Zombie to give Myers a bit more of sheer brutality when he faces a group of people.
Oh shit the trailer came out on my birthday this day just got even better now I'm pumped🥳🥳🥳🥳
Unpopular opinion, I think rob zombie Halloweens was good .
Is it just me or did they show the whole movie basically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ux0-7JKGcD0 My trailer reaction to Halloween Kills.
...the boogeyman is back...🎃
The Boogeyman
Michael Myers using an axe and saw to kill has gotten me even more excited for this. Idc if it’s for a little scene, nice to see him utilize more than a chef’s knife
First another candyman trailer than another halloween 2 trailer I’m in heaven
Myers shouldn't be alive after all that, he can't be human.
My friend watched a test screening of this movie right before COVID-19 quarantine hit and he said that this movie has the largest body count in all the Halloween movies ever!
Lol way to milk the franchise some more. They already have a sequel planned to this one too. Just kill Michael for real already.
this and shang chi damn this day keeps getting better
So you telling me the firefighters thought it was a good idea to stay there when they saw him at the door?
Michael Myers against a whole lots of people
If she can’t kill him no one can
holy cow.
Alrighty people, time to watch a bunch of people in handonfield get killed, I mean there is another movie after this. This 1 just gonna be a blood bath....Cant Wait!!!!
I don' t understand the down votes. Y' all conjuring fans are just horrible like your movies.
That looks super dope 💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Finally a good horror film....hopefully
I know this will definitely be my favorite movie this year! Can't wait for October 🔪 🎃
Did DGG return to film for this one, hopefully? Peace.
This kind of movie makes me love some crowbar
Michael survived the fire of hell itself and he’s pissed off now.
Wow....this franchise is going better and better day by day.
When he accidentally kill john wick pet John wick: nah it's okay have a nice dag
omg cant wait
Welp, time to get my shittin pants back on
1:27 I think that girl in the nurse outfit was from Halloween(2018) since this takes place on the same night
Look at that absolute badass
Wow, Thiis movie look like Halloween 2+ Halloween 4.
I am so ready for this this looks so bloody and brutal I love it I can not wait until this comes out
OMG It’s here
Love the reference to season of the witch at 1:33.
0:13 When the Teacher assigned me and my bully as lab partners.
Only one thing left to do. *Summons Jason Vorhees*
It never ends
Yeeees baby
🍟🍟
“Evil dies TONIGHT!” Does Laurie finally kill the boogie man?
It looks like a bad combination of 2 and 4
Yooo! It’s Dead By Daylight guy!
The only sad thing about this is when Halloween ends comes out that will be the last as we know so far
I loved the Easter egg of Halloween III in 1:33
Why do humans make these movies knowing society isnt right?
i cant already hear "Hi my name is james"
Hell yea more Season of the Witch love.
Tbh I think this trailer kinda spoiled some of the cooler looking kills
So the little kids parents dies
So they just showed all the kills? 😭😭😭
James A. Janice will have fun with this movie
They showed the masks from Halloween 3!
Halloween Ends pushed to 2023 if covid pushed it back from its 2022 date
The only man John wick is afraid of .  This man just doesn’t die
Loooks soooooo good
Not even gonna lie, I'm actually super stoked to see this! I was skeptical but this looks great!
No more lame jokes plz
Like the Halloween masks from Halloween 3 season of the witch. Silver Shamrock still in business this Halloween 🎃
Holy shit balls!
Bruh showed the whole trailer
ahhhh right the final product
Wow they included the masks from number 3.
I AM SO FREAKING HYPED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE GIRLS FIGHT BACK HELL YES!
I'm glad I don't have to go watch the movie after watching this Trailer! Seems as if over 60% of the kills were shown in this so thanks for saving me some cash Universal! :D
Damn bro this movie looks like it will have a lot of and some awsome kills
So...the *entire town of Haddonfield* comes for Myers, *simultaneously...?* Okay, you have my attention... 🤔
...so I guess Michael won't get Covid because of the mask? I mean it's quite an effective mask.
Looks like pure fucking, purge, blumhouse, ultra violent garbage. Please stop beating a long dead horse.
Naw Jason needs to come back to the big screen
About time. Myers is the only classic killer we got on the big screen. Freddy and Jason are no more 🤦‍♂️
That cello kill me now ❤️ 🔪
This Michael is violent and on a rampage. I like it
Just stop. The last 2 movies were shit.
I'm super excited to see Halloween Kills, I can't wait. 😊 😊
I feel like this movie's gonna have a similarly poor script but the extra gore looks like it'll be a fantastic upgrade from what felt like a kind of tame foot in the water we got for the 2018 movie
I just love this movie especially since it has a storyline from 1978 to 2018 to this year and to the one that's coming out next year ND especially all the ppl that come on 1978 r making a return
Dang Michael's got a 6 star wanted level on him now.
Omg!! You can’t kill evil itself!
This is what i have been waiting for. The Shape to fight The Strodes once more.
I'm definitely gonna see it when it comes out
They showed us just enough to hook us, I can't wait to see the mob show down
I Love Halloween And Michael Myers Their Both My One Of My Favorite Movies And Horror Movie Killers You Know I Wanna Watch This!
It’s show time
I hate how much they show in this, like in the previous one half the kills you already knew were coming cuz they showed it in the trailer ruining what could have been the best scenes... Also didn't like they announced a third movie before the second started shooting taking away from letting the movie try to stand on its own knowing whatever happens he'll be back for a 3rd...  I really hope it's good and I'm a huge fan of the franchise but besides Michael looking his best since H1 I dislike the last one more everytime I watch it
Her: Let it burn. Them: Come on boys we got fire to put off. Him: My Halloween mask is still intact. Us: Lets go baby, another thrill ride.
Fuck Michael is becoming a lot more scary, not as scary as the Rob Zombie Michael Myers, but definitely more scarier than most of his versions
They practically showed us every kill 😂
I think it's curious how they won't let us have a clear view of the left side of the mask during the trailer (shadows, a window frame, the angle of the camera) we know because of the thumbnail that it got burned, but what shall that really symbolise for Michael? Is that his last straw into becoming an unstable, unstoppable, ANGRY force of nature?
Why do I feel like this trailer showed a lot?
Based in this trailer, my only concern is how will they make Halloween Ends after this movie? I mean how do you top a town wide mob going after Michael Myers? I need answers lol
I have never smiled so much at a trailer in my life ever before. This is going to be extraordinary.
Seeing his face or hearing him talk will make this movie memorable lol
Hellllll yea.....
I still can’t accept the fact Michael isn’t her brother. Just brought greater depth to the story! Otherwise, these new ones way better then a lot of the other ones.
I hate to break it to you guys but this isn’t the final movie it’s almost there the final movie will be called Halloween ends which will be released in couple of years I think
I can’t wait for Laurie to decapitate Michael only to reveal a Silver Shamrock animatronic’s wiring 👀
Why would they spoil all the kills?
What’s annoying with movie trailers now a days is they basically show us all the deaths ._.
i hope they didnt just show the whole damn movie
WELL WELL WELL
I can’t wait to haul my ass to the DRIVE IN for this one...one of Bob’s beers in my left hand...and one of Mrs. Elrod’s ham samitchs in my right! 👍🏻🎃🍻🥪
WoW
Very Promising!
“I prayed that he would burn in hell. But in my heart, I knew that hell would not have him.” - Dr. Samuel Loomis
The Undertaker of Hollywood is back🙍‍♂️
Excellent trailer, love the Halloween 3 masks
looks soooo gooood 😭😭😭😭
that familiar sound bite @2:09 you know some shits about to happen
Jason Voorhees plays Michael Myers here.  Where is the Shape, the stealth, the mystique of Michael?  The Boogeyman arrives unseen, kills, then disappears mysteriously.  Less can be more.
I'M EXCITED BOYS AND GIRLS! MICHAEL MYERS IS BACK THIS HALLOWEEN! YOU CAN'T KILL THE BOOGEYMAN!
We need a Halloween game with a actual plot and story to playthrough.
🎶SILVER SHAMROCK!🎶
Is he even human? That strength would give the likes of Steve Rogers and Bane a run for their money.  I've only seen the first Halloween movie so don't know the folklore behind his strength. Is it supernatural?
This shit looks good!!
Hell yes this is exactly what I've always expected would go down when they finally get to bring down Michael Myers I can't wait I feel just like a little girl on Christmas LOL
Okay but that Halloween 3 reference, golden!!!!!
This one looks really good, personally I felt Halloween 2018 to be abit lackluster, but I’m excited for this one
Legend never dies
make amogus movie?
The dude is literally Perfect Cell. He nearly dies and comes back stronger.
I can’t wait!! This is going to an amazing October!
The lowkey showed all the kills
I mean so people are good with basically seeing the whole movie in the trailers these days?
What are they chanting at 1:44?
Michael really isn't messing around this time. Wow
Looks awesome
Talk about showing too much of a movie in the trailer
Lori...you left your house in the middle of the forest starting a fire. Of course they are gonna put it down!!!
I'm hyped as shit but.....  Drake bells a pedi👀
2:06 kylo?
He don't need to weak a mask.a black face is enough
Mans has no ed on bro theres no gettin out alive
Damn ... they could’ve saved some kills for the actual movie...
Excellently made trailer. That said the series needs to die. I grew up with most of the movies, then after a decade I binged the series again from beginning to end a few months ago, and it *mostly* wasn't worth it, especially the later movies and without the OG Dr. Loomis. This trailer makes the movie look decent, but the Halloween series just isn't that good or interesting.
I’m shit he’s got a haligan
WELL WORTH THE WAIT BUT Y'ALL SPOILED US WAAAAAY TOOO DAMN MUCH. I DIDN'T WANNA SEE ALL OF THAT 😭😭😭🎃🔪🩸💯😱 BUT I'M GRATEFUL 😂
why did they have to show us the killings?? save it for the movie!! I don't want to see it all in a damn trailer.
The theme song is badass
You just had to kill that poor woman, you just had to.
I still don't like the Title, and the last one's Title is going to be even worse.
This man, this beast, this demon, Michael is in his 70-80's (older than Laurie) and he's still picking people up and killing them with relative ease...AND YOU WANT PEOPLE TO FIGHT HIM? No sir, I would rather run a full mile in a blistering heated desert with no water than even try to fight this guy.
I had to stop watching a minute in...this trailer gives away too much awesome stuff!!! Looks amazing though, can't wait!!!
Well I officially just saw the whole movie in this trailer. Saved me a movie ticket.
Yoooooo this looks good af
People be for real straight 🧢🧢🧢 for mediocre
Holly Shit. This is good, this looks really good.
("You want your mask?!   "Come get it!!") They don’t call it "Halloween kills "for nothing...xcited....bout time 🖤🎃🖤my mikeyyyyy
It's Michael vs. the world
Exciting
Michael Anthony Hall as Tommy Doyle! Season of the Witch masks! THIS IS HOW YOU PANDER TO AN AUDIENCE!
Issokay
OMG So much yes!!!!
so no fucking body has a stupid gun? in AMERICA?
“Evil dies tonight” 🧢
Ain't nobody killing this beast
Did Michael Myers run after that girl in the park?
Michael Dies Tonight Ummm The sequel says otherwise
Oh Fuck Yeah! This October, I will be in the theater to watch this!
Feel like that trailer was the entire movie. What else could possibly happen
wow pretty cool that we get to see most of the deaths before even watch the movie
YOOOO at 1:32 those are the masks from Halloween 3
I got say that the Halloween franchise is way better than any horror movies that comes out today
Those firefighters had big cojones.
I'm excited and all but kinda wished it was more in the style of the Halloween 2018 trailers. To be honest this one seems kinda less serious and more of an action movie style.
I'm shocked that they continued with another movie after they trapped him in the basement and set the house on fire!!!!!!
One of the big 3 is returning
They all could have jumped him at the same time with the ax and the chainsaw or whatever and they still all died Xd
1:33 i think thats a reference to halloween 3
Of course, "100" years old Myers killing people again.... Fan of the old, classic Halloween but sorry, this is bullsh*t.
1:33 Yo! Halloween 3 masks!
i feel bad for the firefighters :/
My Reaction : Hell yess
WOW, Halloween Kills and SCREAM will revive the slasher, SCREAM IS COMING IN JANUARY 2022!
I FEEL LIKE THEY SHOWED A BIT TO MUCH 😔
I can beat MM, just 4 man gen rush him LMAO
🔪🎃
So Michael Myers survived dying, what the hell do you even threaten him with now?
Firefighters see man walk out of burning building Firefighters: “Deathmatch it is then.”
1:38 This guy: What should we do?? Laurie: WE FIGHT   Cap and Falcon: Wait, that is our line
*me, expecting michael to just use blunt objects as weapons like any other serial killer* :  *michael* : lightbulb
YEAH! HE IS BAAAACK!
Jesus man let this shit end already
I can't wait to see this fall in October Micheal Myers man he is thee very man no one can't stop him permently he's unstoppable just like Jason Voorhees just like Freddy Krueger and many more.
Ya quiero verla !!!!
Oh my Goddddd can not wait 🤘😈🖤👌🔥🔪🎃😭
From what I saw of the trailer, it looks really good. Had to stop because trailers show too much.
So hyped for this.
Micheal got that specialist bonus, look how he shitting on these kids.
Hell yeah the town fights back let's goooooo!!!!!!
Golly gee, I wonder how this movie will end!?!1312!  (Spoiler): He'll still be alive for the sake of making the studio/these people more money and beating this dead horse. Be ready for part 2-3-4 (4 being like how the last Terminator movie was literally executed against a wall instead of just the horse being beaten)
Is this the real trailer
¡Expectacular trailer! ¡I loved! I can't wait to see that ✋🏼😳
Finally a real trailer!!
HHahxhehzbhemsnd DAMN YES
"Do it." After that moment, I consider Allison a badass.
Fodaaa demais!! 👏🏻👏🏻🔥🔥
With the Original Halloween 2 with Laurie in the hospital, Rob Zombies Halloween 2 with Micheals new look and a dose of Halloween 4 with people and mobs hunting for Micheal   Sick
By far the best horror/slasher movie series and the best movie villain slasher Michael Myers with jason voorhees coming in 2nd
In the end everyone dies and this fella survive till apocalypse 😭😭😭
Hoooooooooooooooooooooooooooly shit. That firefighter scene.
Universal is killing it with these horror movie trailers
Well add another Halloween movie for Decker Shadow to review
I am SOOO HYPED!!!!!!🎃🎃🎃🎃
Who cares? This franchise should have stayed dead 2 decades ago
Fun fact: My first child was born on release of Halloween 18’, 2nd child is expected to arrive this Halloween 21’😅
This looks way better than the last one I thought the last one was overrated
https://youtu.be/ZSZi0xD9udE
Nice
He never dies😭. But I can’t wait
I am hyped af, this looks brutal
Finally
you showed too damn much
Over a hundred thousand views in less than an hour. Sheesh 😳
Yessir
The fact we saw firefighters fighting Michael rather than the fire tells me this will be one of the best Halloween movies ever. If not, THE BEST halloween movie ever.
Looks good but just think they fkd up announcing the 3rd movie so soon.
The latter half of 2021 is gonna be great for horror fans with Halloween kills, resident evil welcome to raccoon city, and Candyman
The Shape is coming back Hunt
And Halloween 3 mask make  anappearance
Holy fucks!!! Yessssss
YAASSS
It’s time to end it
Very disappointed. This is NOT "Halloween". This is just another hightened version of Rob Zombie's "Halloween". And Judy Greer, very miscast. The genisys. The mood. The heart.  The essence of Halloween/ Michael Myers has been totally obliterated.
Holy shit that looked amazing
Like I want to give a shit but I dont... really enjoy the series but man it's all the same thing.
Bruh even after COVID movies trailers can’t  stop releasing the whole movie lmao
And to think all this started because some little micro budget film in 1978 came out.
eh
MICHAEL'S MYERS IS COME BACK
this new Myers rework for dbd is looking great
Happy Halloween Michael
I finally have my favorite blockbuster for October 🎃💀😈👻🦇
Oh fuk yeah. Michael has returned. Just like Jason Voorhees should.  Always new & inventive ways to kill people. Jason should go to China & visit the Wuhan lab.
So Halloween 2 remade... again
Looks like some Halloween 4 stuff in here as well as the obvious Halloween 3 mask references. I’ll watch it but this trailer seem to show EVERYTHING!
Yesssssss!!!!! Can’t wait!!!!!
Vegas has made Micheal a 24 point favorite over the entire town.
You're all going to be very disappointed with this movie, I'm sure
Holy Shit! I gotta see this movie! I've waiting for this a long time!
Wow
He had to be on flight 828
My face throughout the trailer: 🙄
looks horribly bad
Damn,yesterday i watch "halloween" at fox movies
IM SOOO HYPED FOR OCTOBER THIS YEAR!!!
You know with everything Michael has done you'd think they'd stop with the tactical shit and blow his ass up
the dark Knight rises ????
The 2018 movie sucked and this looks even worse
Holy shit!!! This looks amazing!!!
*can't wait to see Michael get jumped lmao*
This is sooo brutal
I really hope this Halloween is good, not just a cash grab off the Halloween series like a movie with potential, care, and too be good in general
HOLY S***
Did I just watch the whole movie?
gave a way alot of kills
2020: co-vid 2021: hold my beer, Michael's back
Pure Evil is back and it's pissed as Hell
Wait...the masks from Halloween 3???
And he lives again definitely looking forward to what they do now
It love the series and this looks good, but knowing it´s the second of this new trilogy I guess it will be a fun bloodbath and no much more.
Praying this movie comes out , Holy goosebumps Batman!! Need to go in cryosleep till October
God dam Michel became more powerful
LET'S FUCKIN GO!!!!!!
IM SHITTIHG MYSELF BEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD.
This was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 no pun intended. Micheal Myers is no longer Man, he’s Evil 👀
Hopefully it’s not some cheesy ending..
i was so damn mad when halloween kills was delayed from its 2020 release but of course we had to be safe from covid, but now the wait is finally over!!
Calling it: when they taunt him with the mask, he will cut his own face off before stepping out of the shadow just to screw with them.
they better play Mr. Sandman at one point in the movie at least in the opening or end credits
Who else thinks there showing to much In this trailer??
So like a whole bunch of kills have been spoiled now..  thanks trailer
In the beginning no one believed in the Boogeyman, now everyone is looking to kill him.
This was a good movie! A lot shorter than I expected...
The New halloween movies suck
Finally ...
I lnow its not real but, i´ve never understood why dont they just call the army, l mean... bring a fucking tank division and Michal Myers is no more
Looks like a good family comedy
HOLY $#!!
My jaw was and still is on the floor!
At least this looks less shit than the 2018 one
I feel like they’re showing too much in this trailer 😭
He's got permanent t3
#StitchedTogetherPictures I can wait to see Andy reviewing this!!
They are showing us way too much in this trailer. We know how he survived, we know that there is a Halloween 3 Easter egg, and a high body count. Where is the surprise?
This man will never die.
This looks even better than the first one
Guys, it's official.       Michael's immortal.
Is this still a horror movie? Kind of doesn't feel like one.
Trailer 2 Please!!!!!!!!!
Michael Myers: F*ck COVID
Duuuuuude!!!!
I hope the trailer didn’t spoil all the kills in the movie
Halloween 3 reference!!!!!! 01:33
Who called the fire department? Isn't that house in the middle of nowhere?
I just remember cap when the man says what we do and lady says we fight.
I’m getting those chills again.
The Halloween Kills Trailer is here I am so exited that Michael Myers and Laurie Strode are back  to fight each other still, I love the franchise of Halloween.
This shit came out of nowhere  I LOVE IT 😫😩
halloween Fucks.
This looks awful. Terminator Genesis awful.
LETS FUCKING GOOOO!!! Big Mike is back baby!!!
Shang Chi trailer and Halloween trailer within the same night ? Hell yeah
OMG
Oooooweeee!!!
I'm still mad they retconned Lorie being Michael's sister.
Excited to see this. I kind of wish they made the mask look more creepy and scary looking, like melted and fused to his face.
Dead meat is gonna love this
Yes about damn time
The music!!
Any idea what the mob/crowd is yelling?
Nah I can’t do this @ 10:24 @ night 💀💀💀💀💀
I bet my money they're going to end this film with a huge cliffhanger, making us wish to see the final film right away!
Can't wait for the DeadMeat video! lol
Top 10 dumbest horror movie characters  1: firefighters
Chucky getting a TV Show and Michael getting another sequel film who going to win this October ?
The playground masks are a cute little season of the witch reference.
Wow they showed way too much of the movie in this trailer
CANNOT. WAIT.
I hope this movie isn’t a flop and if there setting this up like this i feel like it’s the last Halloween we will get until a new reboot. Now we need a new F13 and Nightmare on Elm Street 🙏🏽
I guess we just watched every killing 😅
Im ready asf for this!!!!!!!🎃🖤🔪🙌🏾
This looks so bad 😂
WoW!  Can't wait for this!!!!
😍😍😍😍😍
Man these horror movie trailers really need to stop ruining the upcoming kills, so disappointing to see probably all of the kills in the movie in the trailer.
AMC stock gonna boom when this hits theaters
Loving those silver shamrock mask Easter eggs from halloween 3
I fully believe that if a nuclear weapon was fired at Michael Myers, he would stab and kill it.
They really needa stop showing the full movie in trailers
Venha. ♥
"Michael Myers is alive" Me: Yeah, no shit
Just pallet stun him or flashlight him.
IM TIRED OF MICHAEL HE DIDNT DIE EVERYTIME😥🙃
LETS GOOOOOOOO!!!!!
This is freakin amazing. They gave away so much though already.
Omg when and how the heck is this ever gonna end??? They have made this go on a bit too long, if they keep it going people are gonna get bored, they need something new, like they need to put the franchise to an end at some point like seriously.
Michael Myers is a monster that won't die. He'll keep coming just like Jason Voorhees and Freddy Kruger
Anyone else feel like they don’t need to see the movie now?
Super hyped, The first one was one of the best films i saw in years.
Can I just say the score slaps, holy fuck!
this looks so trash lmao. Where has creativity gone>? Alfrid Hitchcock is lost on these generation of movies
Michael Myres Vs. All of Haddonfield God I can't for this!
The more he kills, the more he transcends! LOVE That LINE!!!! Very Excited!! I thought the the fist one was really good. Better than what I expected!! This looks Great!!!
Yooo this looks insanely good omg 🔥
😳
Jason and Leatherface reference!?!?
Hell yesss..Can't wait
Never seen a slasher film where the killer goes ham on fire fighters , DAMN
This comes out on my birthday! Real hyped!
If I can only describe my reaction in one word, it would be F*********K!!!!! Cannot wait to see this in the big screens!
Freddy and Jason are nothing compared to Michael Myers.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. All the thumbs up.  I need more thumbs. Relinquish your thumbs unto me!!
1:32 lol is that season of the witch(halloween 3) reference?
Damn. this reminds me of the time I left my wallet at the church. Crazy
I was playing Micheal Myers (the custom game) when I found this trailer
Halloween Kills is essentially Halloween 5: The Revenge Of Michael Myers. With how he took out the firemen it reminds me of that deleted scene in H5 where he took out the entire SWAT team. Speaking of H5, Universal, PLEASE assist them in finding the rest of the deleted scenes from H5 that they were/are looking for so dvd/Blu-ray can be released. PLEASE!?!?
YES!
Thank you for shorting the movie to 2 and a half mins. Now I know for a fact it's gonna be trash.
Halloween Kills: The Open Season of Michael Myers.
https://youtube.com/channel/UCuqaNJIRVBdOKVBrDRvUUIw
This spoils the movie but it’s sick
“Evil dies tonight”  *Halloween Ends confirmed for 2022* Me: 😐
Am I the only one who just got a chub? Hahaha
This trailer gonna make the dead meat easier to do kill count
The king of Slasher Villains has returned!
Looks like the whole town will team up against Michael Myers, that's awesome. Can't wait to see Laurie kick ass again! ✌
So hyped
Can’t wait for October
Here’s my link I did a drawing of Michael Myers
Fortnite bounty: Michael Myers
HOLY FORK BALLS! THIS LOOKS SO GOOD!!!!
When Michael steps out of the burning house and is killing the firefighters, Mister Sandman should be playing in the background.
You can’t kill the firies and expect to have a hit movie on your hands!  Sacrilege!!  🔥🔥🔥 RIP
This trailer showed waaaaaaaay to much
You Can't Kill Michael Myers / The Boogeyman! Yet With Everything That's Been Happening In The World Especially With What Happened On January 6th, 2021 With The Attack On The House Of Representatives Of The United States Of America Must We Have Another Halloween Movie? Because It Might Spark Copycat Killers To Go & Commit Massacres Or Murders On Halloween and Spark Fires On The Night Before Halloween & During Halloween
The whole town going after him feels corny but I'll reserve judgement for when I watch the movie.
Dayum, they're showing a lot of the movie in this trailer
You know Michael is pissed as all hell when he starts 1v4’ing armed firefighters instead of taking his usual, assassin-esc approach to killing.💀
YEAH!
CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!!!!!
FireFighters: TAKE MY HAAANNNDDDD  Michael: So...You have chosen death..
Omg  I can’t wait to see this movie
1:57 is that someone from planet of the apes!!!????
Oml here we go again
This movie looks fucking nuts
They spoiled a lot of kills 😑
Michael Myers is back.... and HE'S PISSED OFF!
Damn.👻
i love how marvel released Shang chi trailer and then comes Universal with a big ball move and releases this one which i am more hyped for LETS GO
Welcome to the Kill Count, where we tally up the Victims in all our favorite horror movies.
I say this almost every year, but October can't come soon enough.
Yeeeees
It’s about time the whole town throws hands against Michael.
Why not just spoil the entire movie lol what the hell is up with studios ruining the experience? We need glimpses and glances, not the full plot laid out beat for beat. This sucks
Michael Myers is flesh and blood but a man couldn't survive that fire
Here at 100k
It's all so tiring.
"The more he kills the more he trasncends"  Love his Tier 3 rework
3c films  rn 🤯
I love how their feeding into the idea that Micheal is not a man and is like a god
F in the chat for those firefighters,  they were only doing their jobs and Michael took advantage of that
Please stop showing so much,have some retraint
I’m hyped
Turned it off about 1:10 in—it’s giving away too much and I don’t want any more kills spoiled. Cannot wait for this!
The shape has fed on our fear for decades. But now, it’s time to take the fight to him….
now its like DBD, The killer has to survive against the survivors  on a side note Candy Man is back too
Just end it here. End it here
finally
Wait…was that the back of the original Elrod house from “Halloween II” at 1:47!?
Let's go!!!
Dude that’s fucking epic walking out a burning  building then killing the whole Fire Department lol
I feel like I just saw the whole movie
Didn’t know this much of a movie could be spoiled in 2 minutes 😭
in the first trailer we saw michael retrieve his mask, which was lying on the ground..now we see judy with the mask in her hands..it seems to me that Laurie's daughter ... RIP
MY BOY BACK BRUH!!!!
This franchise just _refuses_ to die, doesn't it? ...I guess it helps if you constantly hide the killer behind a mask...And he isn't played by Kane Hodder. Eh, but maybe that's not fair; those other two guys are probably embroiled in a lot of rights-related bullshit.
This one looks incredible!
I'm so hyped for this..I can't wait!
Awww Shit
1:33 SILVER SHAMROCK!!! 💀 🎃 🧙‍♀️
Halloween is back!
get ready already
I can’t Imagine that if People in this Film try to kill him then they are going to see that he’s still Alive like Nothing Happened. It’s Immortality, He’s Pure Evil that not even the Afterlife (Hell) would Accept him. I have a feeling that the Cult of Thorn will make an Appearance only if Michael Myers is Alive (Like Every Film except for the Reboot) at the End of the Film that will lead to Halloween Ends in 2022.  I don’t know if the Cult of Thorn will make an appearance since this is the 2018 Timeline but i just got a Bad Feeling about this Film for it’s Ending. But, i’m very Excited to see this Film.
Halloween franchise: yay im getting another movie im so pumped  The blob: cool ill just die alone now
BADASS!!!
Just take him to the jungle gym and loop him around shack and make sure to pre drop pallet and you will be fine when he hits his tier 3.
I think Michael's more than a little pissed.
"Do you want it? Come and get it" by Judas Priest <3
Yes. That's all I have to say
Well I’m a little disappointed that they showed so much kills but I thought it was a nice touch that the 2 costumed black characters(doctor and nurse) that Michael looked at in the 1st movie while walking down the street come back and get killed in this movie. I remember the nurse chick noticing him standing there and then she shrugged it off and they drove away. Never thought that would come back up in the sequel lol
They look like they bout jump the shit Out mike lol this should be good can’t wait
TAKE MY TICKET! IM ALREADY SEETHIS! HALLOWEEN 🎃 IS ABOUT TO RETURN THIS YEAR!
He is...fireproof. No...Hellproof.
sheeeeeesh
imagine Michael talking in this one, it would be amazing
Hossana en las alturas padre celestial a esta generación de maldad Dios nos ama 🙂
OMG is he back again! I can't wait in October so excited (‘◉⌓◉’)(((;ꏿ_ꏿ;)))
Not that I’m complaining but is this the red band trailer!??
Well now this man is basically a walking flesh armored tank
Tengo 20 años y Dios me libro de la adicción a la marihuana 🇲🇽 🙂
Love the "Halloween 3" nod
The GOAT is back
🎃🎃🎃🎃
Honra y Gloria a Jehova Rey de Reyes y Señor de Señores Dios todo poderoso que reina en los cielos y la tierra amén 🇲🇽 ✝️ ⚡ 🔅
Yo I hope they have some more crazy kills to show because what he did to that black lady should’ve been saved for the movie. That would’ve been a wild kill to first see in the theaters.
I'm realizing that this is gonna be a lot like Halloween 2, which is good. That movie is awesome. Let's hope it's just as good.
#HYPE
I'm so excited for this movie! But I'm so disappointed because this trailer is spoiling some death scenes. I think it will be better if the death scenes were not shown on this trailer:(     Sorry for my english
I CANT WAIT BROOOOOO
James is going to have a fun time kill counting this movie
YES!
I'm soooonexited!!! Ievenforgottousespaces!
Is the dude still alive? I guess he's only alive every Halloween then dies again after Halloween ends.
October hurry up
Mikey Myers was running BBQ n Chili I see
Huge fan of the original since I was a kid, but I wasn’t crazy about the last one.. I didn’t dislike it, but I wasn’t amazed either.. 🤷🏻‍♂️ still can’t wait to see this one
really like this new timeline
Let's put all the kill scenes in the trailer
Awwwwww snap, i know what I’m seeing for my birthday
This is going to be a much darker film. I hope Marion doesn't get killed off again. Hopefully Julian survives. Surprised no Leigh brackett.
Really didn't need a 2:30 minute trailer, 1 or 1:30 minute would have been fine imo. This is a bit much
OMG
We need Busta Rhymes back. The only man who can defeat true evil.
I can see something like The sister or daughter (I don't know who the characters are mb) kill him and wear the mask to kill others or sum
I HEAVILY appreciate the use of the halloween masks from Season of the Witch. Thank you, Blumhouse/Universal. <3
Props for that firefighter for pulling out the saw
A trailer I never knew I needed🙄
How does this dude never die?
i got goosebumps watching this. i’m so exciting
Oh my god. That was fantastic
Laurie: *"Again?"*  John carpenter: *"Well...2 more."* ✌️  Laurie: *(Sigh)* *"Very well..."* *(Reloads shotgun)* 🎃🤩🔥
Cool trailer but wish they didn't show so many kills. Now I know when I watch the movie to not care about a lot of people because I know they don't get away.
I see a lot of Easter eggs in there. I make no judgment until I actually see it but I’m not filled with a lot of hope
Finally! finally! The official trailer is came out! 💖💖💖💖💖💖
Finally
These jump scares i dont mind. There fun.  The Halloween franchise specifically H20 and the one previous to this has always been a favorite because their just so much fun to watch without being overly scary.  And btw i just farted
The costumes from Halloween 3 and the way he chashes the car`s window like he did on the first original movie to escape. My God, I need this.
I feel like I've seen every kill in the movie in the trailer!
Sheesh this movie about to break theater records
:0
Thanks now I don’t have to watch it.  Best parts of the movie. Looks lame anyway. Just gore not scary.  I’ll pass
They should have went for head removing!
they should stop putting 90% of the movie in the trailer.
Ohhhhhh so that's why it's called Halloween Kills
This looks f’n Amazing!
Trailer showed way too much, but man am I excited to see this movie!
Is Michael Myers undead or something? I don’t understand how he never dies
Glad I don't have to watch the movie now since they pretty much showed the whole thing.
Omg 😍
looks kinda good, hope it will live up to it
It’s Kyle!
Like jake Paul  said got ya mask come and get it
OH         MY      GOD ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ really looking forward to watching this
The shape is coming in october.
OH SHIT I'M SO HYPED!!!!!! OCTOBER 15
IM FUCKKINGGGG READDDDY
If Michael killing people somehow spoils the movie for you  what were you expecting?
At this point the only thing that fuck the main characters up is the Universal studio. You cant kill a franchise
*stabbing in the dark intensifies*
Looks AWESOME! Can’t wait for it!
So then fire fighters just gonna try to take him 1on1 when they seen him kill the first 1st dude😂‼️
Anoth t rob zombie take?
Didn’t he get his head cut off in one movie ? 😭 like what type of supernatural skills this man got that he survives each time !!!
HYPEEEE HOLLY FUCK SOOO GOOODDDD
I didn’t think they were going to pull it off again ! I think they did looking forward to it 👌
Watch as they don’t kill Mike and there’s another movie: Halloween Kills, for real this time
the fact that there’s another one after that-
ITS HADDONFIELD VS THAT FUCKER
Is this a sequel to the one where laurie burnt the house down in the basement and burned michael?
it is really shitty that this got leaked but TY cuz we got to see it early. I can not fn wait for this!!!!!!!!
Lmao, a whole town vs Michael Myers 🤣 love it already
Not sure I like the violas doing the music.. but otherwise I'm stoked
A lot of hints that Michael and Alison have a connection in this trailer, as was heavily hinted at in the final shot of her with the bloodied knife in Halloween. Is it a red herring or is Laurie going to have to make a shocking choice. The finale of this film is going to be very dark leading into the third film. Strap yourselves in for a hell of a ride.
1:32 those are the masks from Halloween 3
This nigga still ain’t kill his sister he lackin
Damn 1st shangchi and now this, gosh I've never been so early!!!!
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG. Did say OMG?????? This looks soooooooo goooood!!!!!
Looks great! But they did reveal a lot
HE DIDN'T DEAD? Oh Shit...🚫
Hopefully they didn't spoil all of Michael's kills on this bc that was a lot...
Michael Myers is Back and I Can't wait to see it! Halloween is my favorite time of the year🎃🔪🖤
Lol of course the very first thing in the trailer is a how he escaped the fire. the one question that was burning in everyone's head for 3 years, spoiled for everyone.
this also means a maze at universal studious too right?
Anyone else noticed the Easter egg for Halloween 3 Season of the witch 🧙‍♀️
Yesssssssss
So is everyone vs Michael
No point in watching the movie since they showed it all in the trailer.
"Let it burn" is absolutely the right reaction.
Finally we're going to see the conclusion of the story once... and for all
I love the masks reference to Halloween 2
Damn seems pretty cool but nothing beats the classic movie.
that's f'ing crazy?  That was a lot.
BULLSHIT THIS THE OFFICIAL TRAILER👀
Nobody takes his mask
This looks fucking amazing HALLOWEEN KILLS 🎃
1:32 All 3 victims are wearing masks from Halloween III: Season of The Witch and you can even see the Silver Shamrock logo on the back of the Jack o’ Lantern mask.
It would’ve been really funny if the fire fighters just took him out since there’s like 12 of them.  Also why the hell is this trailer showing like every kill?
Dropping a trailer after marvel dropped was not a smart business move …
Anthony Michael Hall plays Tommy Doyle? Interesting choice. They should get Tom Atkins in these films Maybe he could play Ben Tramer since Halloween 2 is no longer in play, but he could die the same miserable death.
I got goosebumps!
Can’t Wait🔥
Yesss dude! I’ve been waiting for a follow up for Halloween 2018. This looks amazing!
I love when movies make Michael more brutal and aggressive.  I am soo ready for october.  I may even buy a jumpsuit and mask
YESS THANK YOU 👏🏽👏🏽
Army of the Dead: we have a buzz saw.   Halloween Kills: hold my beer.
After Shang-Chi now this?! Let's go!!!
This movie will break records. Just a feeling.
Truly a  classic, Michael at his very best. Thank you, Universal Studios for this long awaited film. Surely  a night when no one comes home. Hall🎃ween 2021, will definitely go down in the books as one heck of  a barn burner.
I hopee so many killss,blood,run, and brutal from michael... halloweeen 2018 is goodd but to fast for kill people and we dont see about michael kill mechanic, the policeman,
....I heard the voiceover say "he".  That's problematic. Probably.
Oh ya. Business is about to pick up. Jim Ross
awesome trailer i think it showedto much but awesome was gonna see it regardless lol
As a firefighter, the beginning of the trailer really hurt to watch.
bro will not die nigga call the army
Firefighters: Trying to save lives Michael: I'm taking lives regardless of who you are.
I think Myers is not gonna die in this movie either, cause there is another coming out in 2022
I wish wb or someone can reboot Friday the 13th
Tier 4 michael incoming I guess
Are u serious ? This dude is still alive ,,, honestly this is just getting tedious …..
Ohh that nod to season of the witch 👏🏻
HYPED!!!!
THIS SHIT WAS FIREEEEEE Eugggghhhhhhhhhhh🔥
Why tf is Halloween Ends already confirmed to be released a year after this movie comes out? Pretty much explains that the main characters survive…
Alternative title: Michael Myers vs The World- Official Trailer
This october...will rise back from the graves because of this movie
They weren't kidding when they said Halloween Kills was going to be violent.
They need to summon Jason.
Finally!!!
that was cool asf
Bring back tall mm.
Been waiting on this! Woo! Gonna need to do more than shoot him six times lol
Yessirr
Haddonfield Population Control Award goes to: Mikey Myers!
You can clearly see David Gordon Green on top of his game here. Can't wait for this film. Gonna be 🔥.
The more he kills the more he transcends... I guess Michael Myers is Satan now cause if you count all the bodies since the first movie..
Finally 😍🔪🎃
They will never stop making these movies
Hell yeah
1st - Laurie better be in on the action! I don't think I'll be able to forgive y'all if she is sidelined & in the hospital with no action the whole time or majority of it. 2nd - so help me... Laurie better NOT DIE in this one!! If she does we'll have some major problems. That will not be a forgivable offense
Okay this one might be good
Goodbye Kyle!!
Whoa whoa whoa way too much Blumhouse/Universal!!!  That being said, I simply cannot wait for this movie!
Michaels Myers saw the chainsaw and was like "OH Hell Yeah!!" *bbbbzzzzzzz* 😂🤣
Oh fuck yeah! Jamie Lee Fucking Curtis, baby!!! This trailer is awesome.
*you telling me that an army of firefighters well-trained people to lift heavy objects and probably has multiple pickaxe can't chop Michael Myers to pieces??*
I like what she said I no we are coming for you Michael Myers and go back where you come from in burn and hell 🔥
I had to watch this without sound tonight. Tomorrow morning I'm cranking this shit.
Definitely saw some Halloween 4 & 5 nods.
Obese
so many kills just got ruined in the trailer smh
Damm theyre remaking the original part 2 like they did the original 78 one
Ohhhh i can't wait 🔥🔥🔥💯
Once again. The trailer shows the entire movie.
Happy happy Halloween! Silver Shamrock!
Bro 3 different trailers today this is  Awesome
That was so good
Aw hell yeah! So hyped for this!
Finally after 2 years !?
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I so hyped
AMAZING trailer.
Some of the ideas look good and glad it's not all in the hospital. Michael looks invincible again which I'm unsure is a good thing.
I AM PUMPED!
The only way to kill Michael Myers is get Busta Rhymes.
He just wont die!
Dang 40 minutes only and already has 80k views
Ooohhh it's on and popping now!!!
I got feeling he going to die in this movie because as I was watch he hesitated to kill Allyson and Karen grab his mask I think he going to die in this movie
The whole town vs Michael Myers that’s soooo interesting
You can't kill the boogeyman!! #LONGLIVETHESHAPE!!!
Why does the trailer literally have to spoil most of the movie?
2:14 - Aww, yes, the Myers House is back!
The franchise that gonna keep moo'in till the cows come home!
The trailer is nice, but it seems that they show all the best parts of the entire film in this trailer, the same way they did in Halloween 2018 which is disappointing
I honestly like how he escaped good fucking job! Can’t wait to watch
To defeat him they start bullying him tossing his mask around telling him to come and get it 😭
Holy sh!t. The Boogeyman is gonna get us all 😱
technically speaking since this is supposed to be a trilogy that ends with halloween kills again. we should already know neither team wins here. laurie is probably going to survive and they're probably not going to finish off michael. and we have to factor into this timeline the michael vs jason film carpenter and Cunningham script they wrote. i could be wrong they could finally defeat michael here and halloween kills again will be something new. carpenter did originally want the halloween movies to be about well halloween so maybe he can diverse to that in this movie.
So anyway, i started blasting 🔫😁
im calling it right now. theres a reason we see hawkins body in this trailer
Who the hell asked for this crap?
OMG
YESSSSSS
It’s hard to take this version of Myers seriously. Kill him and move on
Yay!!! Love the nod to Halloween 3! Dude, if tom atkins comes in and saves the day i will gleefully poop my pants
Halloween kills... the whole town, single handedly.
After the trailers for Black Widow and Fast 9 we had a while ago, I actually forgot about this movie!
The Silver Shamrock masks appear again! 🎃💀🧙‍♀️
So anyway, we just started blasting.
WOW
They say he'll die in this, yet they'll just find another way to bring him back like every other horror movie in history
Damm first paramount releases the candyman trailer, and marvel released the new shang chi trailer. Universal be like "I got y'all beat!"
1:33 Silver Shamrock Masks
oh nah i aint watch the first one bc i thought it would be cheesy but this looks amazing 😔
Family is forever 🎃🔪
I saw this already at the screen test showing and im still hype to see it
Love the reference to the third movie, hoped this trailer didnt spoil most of the kills
I can’t wait to break out my Myers mask or Laurie costume to go see this…..  EPIC!!!
Bro how dare the shang-chi trailer probably making everyone miss this trailer
O Brabo voltou... Eu tô surtando real
yesss the theaters are back open, who else is going to go watch this
Alexa, play “The Shape Hunts Allyson”  “Now playi…”  _lights turn off_
another one of those trailers where i feel like i watched the whole movie.
LETS GOOOOOOO
Jamie Lee Curtis is going to slay in this movie
Holy shit, this spoiled so many kills. Very exciting trailer, though!
Looks real good.
Kill count is gonna be higher than eagle balls with this one..dude had like 10kills in the trailer alone
Damn I didn't think this would come out anytime soon. Been waiting for the freaking trailer like all year. The movie will come out before the trailer.
They once again showing too much in a f****** trailer!!! They haven't learned from last time
Those season of the witch masks tho!!
Looks great but who else is there to kill? Feels like you showed us all the good parts of the movie
Not gonna lie the firefighter kills were fine but I feel they spoiled too many kills here.
1:32 nice Halloween 3 masks
This looks awesome as ever!!!!!! Cant wait!!!!!
Michael is pissed!
I love it can’t wait to see it 😃
Showed us a lot of kills tbh
So. Thanks for showing the full movie 😂
🔥🔥🔥
first who did not love it !!!!! God, this is beautiful, each person will be able to shine in this movie, but more will be Michael GOD!!! I want it to arrive on October 15! HAPPY HALLOWEEN MICHAEL🎃
Well I just creamed my candy corn. Holy Shit I am pumped for this treat.
.. nice and all but seriously.. i think they need to end these sequels now.. havent seen any new Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elmstreet films anymore..
This is going to be epic!!!!!!!!
Anyone notices the skull, pumpkin and witch mask from Halloween 3?
LAURIE: " YOU " ! MICHAEL MYERS: " ITS NOT OVER YET "  1978-2159
Spoiler Alert: Michael Myers will actually reveal his face in this movie!!!
HELL YEAH
They really out here trying to combine elements from every Halloween film. I saw a lynch mob like Halloween 4, the masks from 3, hospital from 2, Strode heritage/family at the Myers house like 6, brutality and gritty visuals like the Rob Zombie films, and so and so forth. Like this is just true love to the fans right here. I'm still pissed they showed a lot of the kills in the trailer but this is just filled with love for this franchise.
Not gonna lie…looks like shit.
Holy crap this was amazing Michael is back!
I think they just need to do what Penguin did to Azrael in Gotham, and blow him up with a rocket
No pos ya me contaron toda la peli con el trailer...
THE MORE HE KILLS THE MORE HE TRANSCENDS.....WHHAATT..SUPERNATURAL VIBES FUCKING CAN'T WAIT 4 THIS MOVIE....🎃
Can't wait for 'HALLOWEEN XCVIII'
Can they stop giving away so much of the movie in trailers and sneak peeks? Almost ruined the 2018 one.
WOOOHOOO I JUST GOT SUPER HARD WATCHING THIS!!! Soo EXITED    Edit: Sorry for the over reaction!
things are getting too violent but whatever
Neil Patil So as good as this trailer is unfortunately there is a scene in the 3rd act that prevents this movie from being spectacular….  Spoke to a friend who was at the test screening awhile back. Won’t spoil it but damn it’s annoying!!!!!!!!
So it’s lit is what you’re telling me??
James is gonna have a good time with this movie. There was like 20 kills just from what we saw in this trailer 😳
This is a perfect time for a Myers vs Vorhees movie. Lory still having a hard time killing Michael. Michael Myers goes to the grave of Dr Loomis to dig him up, only to turn and see Jason’s gravestone and seeing Jason’s grave being empty. Michael then learns that an evil other than himself is lurking but he’s not quite sure who. Michael turns to leave the foggy grave yard only to see Jason standing at the gate.
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes!!!!!!!
The darkest souls are not those which choose to exist within the hell of the abyss, but those which choose to break free from the abyss and move silently among us   -Samuel Loomis
this looks AMAZING but they showed A LOT in this trailer. i won’t be watching anymore promo just so it’ll be a nice surprise when it comes out in October :)
This movie is gonna be insane omg so hyped
🔪Bout FKN Time!🎃
about time.
Why’d they show the kills though....those would’ve been great to see in the movies
Hope Lindsay Wallace survives. Her and Tommy actually 😭 other than that. This trailer looks so good! So pumped for October!
This looks so badass
He had all his tier 3 dead by daylight perks on my gosh!! The shape has arrived 😱
So how’d everyone enjoy the movie?  Since basically gave us everything.
Somebody should call Goku
👀👀👀
I really liked how he presented himself in front of the firemen too. I thought he would've secretly escaped. Nope. Front door. What's up? 😂
these are better than those cheap rob zombie films
Halloween: Myers Vs Haddonfield
How Michael Myers didn’t get burn
No one told you. Told me what. That life was gonna be this way *clap clap clap clap
Looking way better than Candyman😒
For all I know Michael Needs Jesus.
Man Michael really has it out for kids in this timeline 😅
Laurie Strode to the mob be like,   *"Now listen up all of you, aim for the hand with all the fingers still left on it"*
This sh!t looks BRUTAL!  *No more Mr. Knife Guy*
Did anyone notice the skull and pumpkin masks? Throwback to Halloween 3?
Michael Myers is RAMBO!!!  I want the fire department to know death is coming and there's  nothing Them can do to stop it !!
No one: Laurie: LET IT BURNNNN!  Also Michael: *FIRE RESISTANCE- 100*
Thanks for showing us all the gory scenes. It is no longer necessary to go to the movies. :D
Holy fuck, this looks so good, my boyfriend and I have been WAITING. It’s finally here guys!! So freaking excited! 😩 you gotta love this side of Michael. 🎃🔪🖤
Michael escaped from the quarantine isolation, cant waitttttttttt for this
Michael Myers is not immortal
Danny McBride is one of the writers. Fuck yeah.
oh my god
I'm sorry, but how many of these are there going to be??
😳
Okay it’s time for new Jason Voorhees movie one last movie
Why in gods name did Universal upload this trailer with fake black bars...literally just render the trailer at the correct resolution so 16:9 people get automatic blackbars and ultrawide viewers get no blackbars. C'mon lads, this is basic shit.
Halloween II and 4 vibes with this one. I already love it
He’s on a mission, they all screwed
we basically just watched the movie
Omg I can’t wait to go fucking see it no lie 💋😍❤️😍💋
holy shit
Michael???????????????????
OMG!!!!!
gotta endure the pain of waiting again 🥲
Ack ack ack here at 35 mins
Damn first shang chi and now halloween kills!!! PERIODT THIS IS ONE GOOD ASS WEEK FOR THE MOVIEGEEKS 😍😍
Y’all showed way too fkn much
pretty early
Nah those firemen should've taken him
Can next month be October
Sorry for the interruption to whoever is reading this and its urgent. One day millions of people will vanish, the rapture is near! Accept Jesus as Lord and Savior! And Live a Faithful Holy Life! He doesn’t want anyone to be left behind! time is short!
The Halloween 3 masks I just - 🥲🥲🥲
Nice. We got Michael Myers hunting parties like in Halloween 4
Sorry for the interruption to whoever is reading this and its urgent. One day millions of people will vanish, the rapture is near! Accept Jesus as Lord and Savior! And Live a Faithful Holy Life! He doesn’t want anyone to be left behind! time is short!
i wonder when Mr.Myers eats
Goosebumps ..... the reaction of the firefighter when they see Michael is damn good.....  More blood....yeah can't wait to see
Sorry for the interruption to whoever is reading this and its urgent. One day millions of people will vanish, the rapture is near! Accept Jesus as Lord and Savior! And Live a Faithful Holy Life! He doesn’t want anyone to be left behind! time is short!
Damn, Michael’s gonna be a BEAST in this!🙌🏾
Written by Danny McBride  Nope!
POGGERS
Ohhh my god😮❤
Yep. As a horror fan, I can't wait. Hopefully we get more of a back story with this one even though they wanted the mystery of Michael to be more of a driving force than his origin or explanation of what he is. I'm ready either or.
EITA PORRA!!!! SÓ VEM MICHAEL!  😍⚡
you show way too much of the movie in the trailer
OMG! The masks from Season of the Witch make a cameo!! O.O 1:32
Looks great but this trailer showed wayyyyyyy to much
1:33 nice reference
the only thing that gonna stop Michael is the  Pallet
Yessirrr
Did anyone notice the Easter egg of the Halloween 3 season of the witch masks with the pumpkin, skeleton, and witch
LETS GOOOOOOO
I screamed in excitement a lot throughout this trailer so that’s a good sign for October 😌
1:39  "what do we do, Cap?" "we fight"
1:32 - 1:37 Were those masks a reference to Halloween III: Season of the Witch? Or was that just a coincidence?
Of course trailer spoils a lot
We know evil is not gonna die this year. Because there is another sequel already green light
"You Don't Believe In The Boogeyman, Well You Should"
Halloween 3 references. Nice touch Halloween Kills.
HOLY SHIT BALLS!!!!
I am hereeeeee for the Strode women kicking ass. 💪
My favourite movie slasher of all time🤙🔥‼️
"I'm coming for you Michael" *That's what she said!*
Udah susah payah dibawa ke basement buat dibakar, malah di selamatin.. sikopet mah kuat..😂
Wowzers.
Congratulations. A whole town managed to piss off someone who was already pretty pissed off. 😂  Michael finna catch BODIES!
Now that’s a Halloween trailer 💪🏻💪🏻
1:33 The masks from Halloween 3: Season of the Witch, nice easter eggs ;) *Silver Shamrock!*
Did they show all the deaths ???
This is going to be insane 🍿
I hope they get rid of the dumb comedy in this one. I gotta say I can tell already Judy Greer is gonna get on my nerves. “You want your mask? Come and get it!” Has got to me the cringe of the century.
They turn Myers like Jason…. Sad 👎
This should've been called the revenge of Michael Myers
That is such a brilliantly simple way of explaining how he survived the fire.
I feel like I've seen the first part so far
“The trailer showed too much.”   So did 2018s trailer, and no one cared.
It’s over he can’t hurt anyone ever again  Michael : Bet
OH GOD I am HYPED AF FOR THIS!! Though ya know if this had come out in the early 2000s Let The Bodies Hit The Floor would be playing all this trailer from Michael's Carnage lmao
LET’S GO!!!!!     🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👏👏👏👏👏👏.   The way Michael walked out of the house while it burned and seeing some blood in the trailer is just savage, even it’s not red band by any means. Jesus Christ, the hype is real!!
Can’t wait for the DBD cosmetics from this
Badass !!!
Nice Halloween 3 reference with the masks.
Looking fucking awesome still not sold on the Title.
“You can’t kill the Boogeyman!”
PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD MAKE SOMETHING NEW!!!!
AINT NO HALLOWEEN MOVIE HAS THIS BUSNIESS OF LOOKING THIS GOOD!!
I'm really gonna enjoy this
It’s really great seeing Jamie Lee Curtis on screen
Why are they trying sooo hard to make jamie lee curtis looks badass, its getting really annoying
Yay! I can't wait to see Michael Myers again.
Hell yeah can’t wait!!!!!
Loving what I'm seeing.     This kill count is gonna be through the fucking roof.   Team Michael all the way on this one.   Mike vs Haddonfield 10/15/21.   Get the popcorn ready
POV: The year is 4570 and yet another Halloween movie is coming out in October this year
Michael needs to be in  the US armed forces and then no need to worry about the enemies..
That theme man, you cannot be NOT pumped when you hear it. And I like the little twist of them chasing him down now.
Feel like I just watched all the good bits
This is giving me more hype for this movie
Showed too much but wow, I’m ready this trailer got me hyped asf.
If you pay for this ur an idiot…just another cash grab sequel
I loved this so much!! Can't wait for the movie!!!
Jesus did they give away every kill in this trailer? Lol
Can’t wait to take the family to watch it!!!
The only reason he's getting all these kills is because he equipped "Save the best for last" and "Play with your food"
This man legit took out all those people in that trailer imagine what we didn’t see yet
I love him let’s gooo
*Lots of people wants to hunt down Michael*  Michael: You're free trial of living has expired
I guess Michael was encouraged by his dear friend Leatherface to dabble in the art of Chainsaw Massacring.
oh my god id never waited that this ended as it was mannnnnnnnnn
Why this feel like fast and furious.
Finally we get to see Michael really in action. It isn’t a cut away or we only see the aftermath. Michael looks hungrier than ever
This looks like a great horror film. The victims actually fight back
Cameron looking at the blood is probably his dad Lonnie's dead corpse.
Yeah they should clear this, he is a ghost or psychopath
so basically this is Michael vs everyone and there will be only 3 survivors at last?! even john wick can’t do that 😯
Most brutal Halloween I've seen and it's only the trailer!
SILVER SHAMROCK REFERENCE
Freddy and Jason are coming next
*Freakin’ sweet!*
They showed too much. I’m still very excited and glad to see my b*tch Kyle Richards
this movie is gonna be crazy the trailer already got me hyped
Did not expect the fluorescent light tube through the neck there
I’m starting to think Michel Myers can just respawn
Ha the masks from 3
I like that they included the masks from Halloween three I’m glad to see the studio showing an actual good movie some love
HELL YES! HES BACK AND READY FOR REVENGE!
I can’t wait for this I love Michael Myers!
Dude 85yrs old still killing people 🤦🏾‍♂️
Silver Shamrock masks?
I’ve never seen such a badass movie get spoiled so quick… it’s fucking Halloween!!! U dnt have to show this much to get seats in theaters! I mean it spoiled some juicy kills is what I mean 🤷🏿 shoulda left a lot of this out
Post teen blondes just can’t get enough
Mikey is back!
OH man i am getting exited about this more then the forever purge trailer like mical is fucking scary now
Universal doesn't just show you the date. They just put October, and just knew that you will know when he returns. Can't wait for Halloween!
Daryl Dixon turned evil and he's hunting Carol, interesting
Nice I'll review it on my channel soon!!
the night the man came home
I don’t like how they’re showing most of his kills. Save some of that.
Wish they didn’t show sooo many of the kills but looks promising
I’m just gonna say it... This trailer revealed too much
Awh man they should have just LLLEETTT HIM BURRRNNNNN!!!
holy FUCKING SHIT
YESSSSSS!!!!!!this look good AF!!!
The Monster returns. And he’s back for more!
The idea of the entire town trying to hunt down Michael is cool.  They did something like that with Halloween 4, but on a much smaller scale.  Also a great excuse to have Michael rack up a massive body count.  I hope Laurie’s daughter and granddaughter get more focus here as well.
Can’t wait to see it
Bro right after the shang chi trailer
Michael Myers is clearly superhuman in HK.  Why do so many people claim he is just a normal 61 year old man?
Michael's using god mode cheats
*sigh* I miss when fire actually killed Michael. The second Halloween should’ve been the last.
0:35 okay that was fucking badass
First candy man now this. This is just keeps getting better and better
LET'S GOOOOOOO
Why are they showing so much smh , too many kills they showed could of saved some for the movie damn
Michael is all the great slashers wrapped up in one in this trailer. Burnt like Freddy. Brutal like Jason, Sawing like Leatherface. LET'S GO.... I'm so ready for October.
So pitch meetings was right
Loved 2018 I hope this one continues to put the franchise back on the right track. Wish they didn’t show as much as they did in the trailer tho.
1:10 i thought this cliche was over in this post jordan peele era
Holy fucking shit balls that looks fun.
Madre Mía! 🙊
Awesome and can’t wait to see it 😁
Laurie” I’m coming for you Michael” gave me goosebumps
Fuuuck. Michael is getting quite the damn body count in this film.
so much adrenaline from this trailer alone. so hyped for October <33
Absolutely fucking love the Season of the Witch reference. These writers are 💯
KYLE RICHARDSSSSSSSS OH MYYY GOODNESS 😍😍😍😍
Dead Meat: *Ah Shit Here We Go Counting Michael killings Again*  Watch when the movie out on bluray He gonna have a hard time to count
trash lolol
“I’m assuming this comes out on Halloween because of the title” -Some crazed person
Geez man it’s past Halloween
Fuck yea
As good as this looks, I don’t know if I want to see it.  The previous one felt so personal and cathartic to me and it felt like the perfect end to the franchise because Laurie was able to let go of Michael and the decades of trauma he caused her.
The trailer alone is a bloodbath.
Great trailer. They managed to fit the entire plot of the movie into 2 minutes and 30 seconds.
this is really garbage. #metoo waayyy up this movie's ass. jus like the last one too.
How many Halloween movies they going to continue to make?😕
Man I can't wait for this. This looks so awesome
I'm here for it
Holy fuck, yeeees
i hate when people whine about the trailer giving away too much but this did show a lot of kills  so i have to believe that that was just the tip of the ice berg.
"Michael Myers is flesh and blood, but a man couldn't have survived that fire..."  "This isn't a man."
The essence lives for some years
James Jude Courtney could be in competition for not just best Myers but scariest Myers that man is wicked as hell in this
God, that's a horrible trailer but the movie looks sick.
Did anyone notice the nurse from the 2018 film that got spooked when she saw Michael staring at her before she got in the car getting attacked in this trailer?
Did anyone else notice the Silver Shamrock masks in the trailer? Possible Season of the Witch connections…
Can't wait to see this!! So stoked!!!!🎃🔪💖😃
Love the nod to part 3 with the masks!!! I love that film!
Omg the new rendition of the main theme gave me goosebumps.
Lets goooooo
“I prayed that he would burn in hell. But I knew in my heart, that hell would not have him……” -Dr Loomis Halloween 5.
Anyone notice the dead bodies with the season of the witch mask?
wow this looks great and epic I can't wait to see it Jamie Lee Curtis is a totally badass this looks like it is going to be one of the very best Halloween movies ever i can't wait
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKING HELL!!!!!! 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
Imagine risking your life by going into a burning building to save someone only for them to kill you and your fellow firefighters.
Michael Myers emerged from the burning house: alright... who gon meet their maker first?
another shit halloween movie lol
I mean, is it scary if he kills from start to finish? RZ’s Halloween really suffered from audience exhaustion.   Also, I take issue with Michael’s desire to kill everyone. He seems to have more purpose in the original film.
It's one thing to kill unexpected civilians who are defenseless.  But the fact that this dude came out of that burning house to take on probably at least half dozen well trained firefighters? As evil as Michael is, you gotta give him some respect.
People of Haddonfield: It is over, Michael. You are surrounded  Michael: All I am surrounded by is fear...and dead men
AMC TO THE MOON BOYS
I haven't been this excited to see a Halloween film in quite some time. Thank you Blumhouse.
Call me a monster, but I want Michelle to win
HELL YEAH
Wow, now THIS is the Shape we all deserve. About time!!!!
Deus O jeito mais fácil de enfrentar as dificuldades é lembrar que elas são temporárias... Permanentes devem ser a Fé, a Força e a Coragem de transformar o tropeço num impulso para ir cada vez mais longe... Descansa o seu coração, e deixa Deus trabalhar naquilo que for necessário em sua vida. Por mais que o barulho das tempestades tentem te mostrar o contrário, o que é dEle para sua vida chega na hora certa. Aquieta-te e deixe Deus conduzir o seu dia, inspirar suas ideias, direcionar os seus passos e te livrar de todo o mal, te abençoando e te fazendo vencer. Juntos somos mais *Otimo diaaa...*
Thanks for showing basically the whole movie in 2 and a half minutes.
Universal, you showed WAYYYYY too much!!! Why would you release a trailer like this?
I’ve been a huge Halloween fan since I was 10.  It feels like years since the last Halloween movie came out.  I can’t believe we finally get to see this.  Michael is almost home.
if this is the last movie PLEASE let Michael Myers fight maskless for his last stand
They showed wayyyyyyyyyyy too much
Omg love it  can't wait see it 😍
they made another one of these shitty movies
eu queria tanto ver esse filme no cinema, maldito bolsonaro que não comprou vacina
Showed way to much!
YALL IM SCARED😭😭😭
I love you and I hate you universal, I realized your trick against disney (Alias ​​MARVEL) :)
1:33 a reference to Halloween 3: season of the witch
This looks really good looking forward to it
Finally!
Never have I been more positive that they should have stopped after the original H1 and H2. It was the perfect story with the perfect ending.  This is pure cash grab garbage. At this point Michael doesn't even have an identity.  You could literally insert Jason into this trailer and it would make no difference.
Music, is GREAT.
Here before it's on trending,!
:O
“This fucker is unkillable.” - Ryan Reynolds
Great movie, kind of short but pretty good
Michael Myers is a power House Dame
FUCK YEA!!!!!
YO YO YO MICHAEL IS BACk
I appreciate the Halloween 3 masks cameos there
Hell yea I’m pumped
Funny how the leaked photos led to leaked trailer and boom here’s The official trailer for H Kills
Can’t wait to see the Kill Count for this one!
Excellent.
I’d rather see the movie than this trailer to be honest. I really wanted to see this one a long time ago. I’m still counting the days till they release it🥴🗓
THIS BOUTA BE 🔥🔥Am So Excited!!!!
I mean micheal n jason are those guys i don’t want them to die but kill kill n kill!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Trailer showed off way too much I thought
Why is it that trailers spoil everything
This trailer looks like this movie will be the best in the whole franchise!
Who else noticed the H3 masks?
I got me and mom tickets to go see the Purge. I guess now I can cancel them ;-)
OMG! This Fanboy is ready!!!
“A man couldn’t survive that fire.”*Laughs in Halloween 4*
Ok...........This looks epic. Michael Myers at his full potential.
Michael Myers, you fucking legend!!!!!! 🎃 I can’t wait!!!
After seeing this trailer I love how everyone in this film are gathering around to find and kill Michael. Making a stand and showing that we don’t need to run and fear him any longer.
This should be cool, the 1 thing that has always been missing from these movies is, what if someone were willing to fight Michael in the darkness without fear.
You’re telling me all I had to do to get a film that uses the shape properly was sit through a shitty reboot?   About time! This actually looks good! You have my money happily this time
I’m gonna get my comment in about the silver shamrock masks before anyone else.  Beyond that this is like brutal. Must be what it’s like to be a demon in doom
Just wait until he reaches tier 3
I’m so excited, I love micheal, but uhhh do they think they can kill him, this dude survives everything, he’s built different
Glad Jamie Lee Curtis came back for the franchise, it's really great to have her
Shit, this looks so good
He’s back for more 🩸🔪
Dios!!!!!
Michael in burning house be like ;  Call an ambulance,  but not for me.
Cool. I just watched the whole movie
Love the Halloween 3 reference there!
This October is going to be memorable as hell since the Shape is back in theaters. Looking forward to Halloween Kills this Fall.
Boy was that a flimsy excuse for Michael surviving an exploding inferno around him trapped with no where to go
The best thing about this movie is that we know Michael's gonna survive as theres another sequel after this
This is gonna be good !!!!
1:32 made me geek out
Que emoción
halloween 2018 was only the begining
Let’s goo looks amazing
THE SHAPE IS ALIVE THE SHAPE IS ALIVE THE SHAPE IS ALIVE  THE SHAPE IS ALIVE   THE SHAPE IS ALIVE    THE SHAPE IS ALIVE       THE SHAPE IS ALIVE           THE SHAPE IS ALIVE              THE SHAPE IS ALIVE                  THE SHAPE IS ALIVE ☠️
🌼 Michael using Chainsaw  💀 Leatherface - That's like my Boy😘👍
I literally do not care who dies in this movie as long as it’s not Laurie, Karen or Alison
Looks good but I think they showed way too much,  especially with all the kills.
Did anyone else notice that 3 of his victims were wearing masks from the third Halloween movie?
Lemme grab my brains splattered across the room…
Ah so is this gonna be on the same night as the previous movie?(like the original Halloween 2)
Thanks for showing me the whole movie.
Michael is just taking no prisoners in this film. Holy fuck those kills were brutal
Just when you thought it was safe to trick r treat again.....
1:32 nice reference to the third film!
Universal I was an extra in this lol you filmed at the hospital and school in nc 😂😂
The Halloween III Easter egg was cool
Ah caray
IT’S HERE!!!
I think the trailer revealed way too much! I still want to see it though.
Holy fuck I am so damn excited for this.
Props to that one Firefighter going after Michael with that saw.
Michael is on a killing spree
People tend to forget that this is a 61 year old Micheal Myers...im still waiting for the scene(s) where he puts his killing spree on hold to relieve his bladder or rub on some bengay
Dead Meat is going to have alot of fun with this one
1:39  What do we do? We fight! Let’s hunt him down. Mob gather in arms to kill Michael. My reaction: Let’s go kill us a boogeyman.
Tell me why I got on YouTube and THIS shit came up  But in reality this shit is cookbooks👍🏿
Another nod to Halloween III! I love it!
This looks amazing
Man so script  i read is just like this trailer.  So i know, who survived and who didnt. Oh my gosh i very nervous. I  was in tears
this looks so good. CANNOT WAIT
The whole time I was watching this, I was going, “holy shit! holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit! HOLY SHIT!” The title was definitely not lying about The Shape killing but man does it not cover the brutally factor. I’m gonna shit my pants when I see this in theaters
That’s ridiculous! How is he freaking alive? 🙄 I am in thought 😂 lol  Just watched the whole trailer and I agree with her!
Amo!
Jesus 👀👀 This is going to be wicked
So good 🔥
Imagine if they  just send special forces on michael's ass
I was so excited for this that I creamed my pants
Except we know there's gonna be a 3rd one already....so....
I cant believe i'm early
Omfg
This is so exciting cannot wait 😍🔪🩸🎃
Oh Hell Yeah I Cant Wait To See This
looks like more feminist trash from blumhouse 🥱
YESSSS MY #1 FAV KILLER IS BACK🔪 I hope this is going to be a good movie and hopefully he comes to mk11🙏
Halloween Kills   October 15
Stoked! I can't wait to be sitting in the theater opening night.
0:13 is honestly so great and has amazing acting. saying let him burn just shows how scary michael truly is. this movie seems good
Fuck yes. This looks so good!!!!
Yes
😀😀😀😀😳😳😳😳
sussy baka
wow ...
Shame they keep spoiling most of the kills in trailers these days.
Love, love, LOVE the Season of the Witch Easter egg at 1:33
Ugh, this looks so good. I cannot wait for Halloween!
love the season of the witch reference with themasks
Best trailer ever!
The dislikes are from the Firefighters 🚒
The entire town of Haddonfield banding together to take him down is badass 👏🏽
The original Halloween was successful because of it's slow burn.This director seems to have learned nothing from that movie
I’m so very hype for this movie
Rando: Are you telling me a man did all this?  *Turns toward him* Michael Myers... is 'not' a man...
Never gets old seeing the Halloween 3 masks! 1:33
This is literally what every Halloween fan could dream of. Thank you David Gordon Green and Danny McBride. Who'd have thought a couple of comedy geniuses would save a seemingly dead horror franchise. You are all in for ONE HELLUVA movie!
Black cats and goblins and broomsticks and ghosts, covens of witches with all of their hosts. You may think they scare me, you're probably right.  Black cats and goblins on Halloween night.  Trick or treat!
O NOU MICHAELS RETURNS.
QUE TRAILER MEUS AMIGOS, QUE TRAILER
HOLY SHIT!!
Michael: "I DIDN'T HEAR NO BELL!"
Yo ho✌️✌️😎
Let it burn! Let it burn!! Sounds like Laurie is a big Usher fan.
So did Hawkins lived since his name is in the description ?
Showed way too much
I really hope this is the end
Halloween certainly kills
Yo this bouta be good
Holy fuck! I’m so ready
1:33 WAS THAT A HALLOWEEN 3 REFERENCE???? 😳
Umm....did this editor reveal all the good parts? Because I just saw some kills
This year just getting better and better...
Only stopped rewatching the trailer to post that it was so worth the wait man I can't wait for the movie to come out
This was worth the wait
I feel like some of the dialogue and acting might be a lil cheesy. But I’m just here to see Michael kill some stuff with dope music so I’m excited
OMFG, this looks amazing.  I can't wait to see it. Us horror fans have been waiting a long time for this and now this fall, our waiting has come to an end.
YES, YES and FUCK YES.
did they just spoiled the fact that Lindsey dies in the movie?
YOOOO
Candyman: I am gonna rule horror of 2021  Michael: On your left
This first part of the trailer gives me savani jadon vibes
So yeah this looks a bit good.
Nice use of the Shamrock masks from Seasonof the Witch.
Laurie: *How many times do I have to teach you a lesson old man!*
LET´S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
So fuckin hype for this
*“A man couldn’t have survived that fire, the more he kills, the more he transcends, he’s the essence of evil.”*
I was so not expecting this trailer Tonight 👁️👄👁️
Hang on how many times has michael killed Jamie Lee Curtis? This is unstoppable force
I almost cried im so excited haha
LETS GO
So we’re going back to the storyline of him not being human again hmmm…
I’m impressed 🔥
Michael using a buzzsaw, YEEEEEEEHAW! Can’t wait for October !
Omfg this looks so badass!!! 😍
Michael will never die. NEVER!!!! MUAHAHAHAHAHA
Can’t wait
Dat look gooood! 👍
Oh hell yeah.
Never die
The firefighters tried to fight Michael brave but useless
Getting real Halloween 4 vibes.
i saw the movie recently the 2018 Halloween since not really into horror movies and i really liked it can't wait to see this
Love the subtle nods to Halloween 3 (Silver Shamrock masks) and 4 (Michael using the shotgun to probably kill Cameron). Dead Meat’s gonna have his hands full with a kill count for this one.
Got to love the Pumpkin masks from Halloween III. Awesome
EPIC!!!!! 🖤🔪☠️🔥💯👌🏻
Dude I need to see this movie!
Um, why is nobody mentioning the dead kids at the playground wearing the Silver Shamrock masks from Halloween 3?
Cool.
hang on how many times has michael killed Jamie Lee Curtis? She is the unstoppable force!
I hate that they showed all the kills in the preview !
Even the guy with the buzz saw couldn't stop Michael.
"evil dies tonight"  "an hour ago I stood up and fired six shots into him and he just got up and walked away"  evil never dies
Well another year and next year is the end.
time to watch every hallowen film
Loved the previous one! Eagerly looking forward to this one.
Shiitttt this shit looks fire asf
The awesome thing about this? Looks like the whole town's going after him. And yet he'll still somehow survive, considering "Halloween Ends" is confirmed.
Micheal Myers must be stopped until evil is over
HORRIBLE AH🏳️‍🌈
Man... im ready for it.
goosebumbs
🔪🍿
I’m sorry but Myers is not stronger then Jason he still can’t kill the old lady🤣🤣🤣
LET IT BURN!!!!!!
Finally a real full trailer
Hellyes!!!! Just please dont have to much forced humor!!!! But danny mcbride wrote this one too so. But still excited
It’s gonna be crazy seeing Michael attack 911
The trailer didn't leave much to the imagination. They threw the kitchen sink in there 😂
Michael is pissed so bad in this movie😂😂he’s just gonna be an unstoppable force in this movie, I literally couldn’t be more hype.
Wow I have never seen so much anticipation for a trailer and it definitely lived up to the hype. I don't care what other people say this is the most anticipated movie of 2021 and I can't wait.🎃
Okay this actually looks epic
A good trailer should literally only be 1 minute long
"I met this... six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and... the blackest eyes - the Devil's eyes."   🎃
Fuck this looks incredible
This is looking to be one of the best Halloween films ever made. Really hoping that the trailer accurately reflects the movie
1:37 is that nurse Meriam? :((
can you guys STOP SPOILING THE DEATHS IN THE TRAILER WTF
Haddonfield vs Michael
Tou Morto!!!!!!!
The shape lives
I’m ready for this bring it Michael
Oh man, I’ve never been so hyped for a movie in a long time.
Yes yes yes
Yes please,    about damn time
Uh o, someones not very happy🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣...... cmon 10-31
I’ve been patiently waiting!!!!!
Mikey boy won’t stay dead! I’m loving it
Iron man: I'm the strongest Avenger.. Micheal: hold my knife.. Oh wait I actually need that.. nvm .. I'll find em on the road.
1:33  Nice.  Silver Shamrock Masks.
HOLY SHIT.
Again.. another fucking trailer that gives away the ENTIRE MOVIE. Thanks for saving me the $15 on a ticket.
😮😮😮
I had to stop after a minute and fifteen seconds because they're showing too many kills that I didn't want to see until I watch the movie  Trailers need to chill.
1:32-1:34, 1:37 The Silver Shamrock Masks returns. 🍀🎃💀🧙‍♀️
First Sing 2 then Shang Chi now Halloween!!!!
I CAN'T WAIT!!!
So Michal is officially superhuman. Laurie said a man couldn’t survive that fire. There was always hints of him being such.
So pumped!
Seeing this trailer now I’m confident Michael can kill Jason voorhees
Bruh I bet the grandkid is dead😂  They just spoiled it
Michael rampaging on the night he came home.
*This looks soooo good, can’t wait!!*
Depressão: curada.
THIS LOOKS AWESOME AND EPIC!!!!!!
My hype is immeasurable
Poor firefighters
Lets fucking go.
Evil dies tonight!  For the 100th time.  Which will be the first time you get to see the last time of the beginning of the last time evil lives before it dies again and then dies for the final first time...again.   Oh c'mon, that had to be said.  LOL
Awesome I just the whole movie thanks.
Showing too much in a trailer is a shitty advertising tactic if you ask me. That being said I can't wait for this!!!
Oct is my favorite month I am so ready been counting it down.
Oh my god I’m literally so excited
Ayyyeeee! It's about to go DOWN! #Halloween2021🙈
Damn this film look's awesome! This look's way better then Halloween 2018.
Damn trailers suck nowadays. Not leaving much unseen. Probably a safe bet the 10 murders shown here are 10 of 15 in the whole movie.
About time!!! I'm fucking excited can't wait!!
🇧🇷
Evil never dies, Happy Halloween 🎃
"Let it burn!" = No Firefighters
"The more he kills the more he transcends." DBD players: "The more he stalks, the higher his tier."
If only jason was here, then we can have a real showdown!
He’s alive good for him
Laurie is definitely going to die
I like it, but why is the trailer showing all these kills…
Love it.
ok?
The show down is coming!!
WoW... This looks GREAT‼️🔪
A glimpse.
No way I'm so excited
LETS GO🎃
Okay... we know that Michael wont't die in this movie because of Halloween Ends, i wonder what's going to happen in the ending of Halloween Kills
OMG Yes !!!
Bruh the whole town?! Crazy!! Lol can't wait for it
Just one more movie after this
I love how the firefighter are trying to kick Michael's ass
THE REAL Revenge of Michael Myers
it looks super CGI when he’s in front of the fire 😂
After months and months waiting for this trailer, they definitely delivered and I can’t wait to see this movie, it looks amazing.
OMG
Damn, y’all were right! People commented on the Candyman trailer that this one would follow soon and boom, here it is. lol.
I’m glad no delay again
This trailer made be HYPED!!!
God DAMN this looks AMAZING!
I'm chilling minding my business watching the NBA WCF not bothering nobody and Blumhouse decides to uproot my whole night. I will never forgive you guys for that. But my god my god, Michael looks beautiful. I NEED IT, I NEED IT SO BAD. Halloween Kills!!!!
i think it looks kinda just meh...........makes me sad to cus i was looking foward to this. ALOT.
Show me all the kills. Is there even a reason to watch now?
to think all this was shot and ready to go before the pandemic. this'll be like going back in time
The trailer gives away a lot of juicy kills but I am still SO STOKED!!!!
Holy.  Fuckin.  Shit!!!!!!!!!  I am fuckin pumped now!
Awesome!!
1:32 I think that's the couple from that one shot scene in 2018 where michael was going through houses killing people
The day he comes home 😈😈😈
Looks better then the first one
Watched the 1st 5 seconds and stopped it rt there! I wanna watch it so bad but I’m waiting! Want it all to be fresh!
Just get a flashlight lol
Spoyler
OMFGGGGGG
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I mean it looks awesome but I also feel like I just watched the whole movie
Michael is gonna come back hard
The night HE returned.
My life depends in this movie
If only Halloween 2018 had this vibe! Love the aggression and feel it has!
there was so many deaths in just the trailer i can’t wait to see how many more are in the full movie. i’m so excited
Finally this looks fucking awesome
This Looks Hella Crazy  Count me in!!
"The more he kills, the more he transcends." Okay, seriously? Are we really going down the Thorn trilogy route again and try to explain why Michael is always getting back up and seemingly immortal? Just stop it. He's a guy in a mask.
Fuck the red band trailer, ha!
trailers been up for barely 15 mins and i've watched it 666 times. wait, what?
SO. FREAKING. READY. FOR. THE. BLOODSHED 😈😈😈
Nobody: Sam Loomis: You could not with your own failure, and what did that bring you, back to me.   RIP Donald Pleasence
awesome
He's back
Yooooo omg no body is stopping Micheal omg my boy is a beast 😂 Micheal saying f” dat I’m the OG of horror lol 😂 F” Jason and all of em 😂 I can’t wait 😜
YOOOOO
Melhor filme de terror q existe the best Halloween!!!
Can’t believe they just gave away almost all the kills. Fuck!!!!
Just release it today so I can see this thing already.
OMG I GOTTA SEE THIS
That opening scene is HILARIOUS.
So, Nancy Stephens characters dies. I don't know why they would even add that in the trailer. Look at 1:37.
Jesus Christ they just gave away most of the good kills probably this is actually a terrible trailer damn...
Batman: I'm Batman  Michael Meyers: *Walks backward*
That remix of the song tho 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Finally😆😆
I knew he survived in the gun compartment
Waiting for it !! Or am I becz again he'll escape for next Halloween 🎃
HELL YEAH!!! LET'S GO!! I'm hyped!
bro I just got on YouTube and saw Shang-chi and Halloween kills trailer what is this early Christmas?
Well this came out of nowhere 😳
Let’s hope they release a final trailer around September so they don’t spoil more
Are they trying to say micheal Myers isn't human ?
Okay Freddy and Jason. Your turn
Now that's what Im talking about.
YOOOOOOO THE BRUTALITY
i am here for Kyle Richards' bangs
OMG YES FINALLY!!!!
Here we go! Can’t wait for this! Long live the Shape!
Can't wait for this period🔥🔥
This looks way bloodier. I don’t want bloodier. This is a Rob Zombie movie
🖤🖤🖤
When is this coming out?
Enough Michael, i cant
Hope the movie as good as the trailer 🙏🏼
I'm back
It's beautiful!!!!!
This is the coolest fucking shit ever
As a matter of fact, that WAS the bogey man.
Well holy shit.
The town is done being scared it's time to fight back
YES, BITCH! CAN'T WAIT! MICHAEL MYERS = KING OF HORROR !
Yessss can’t wait to see 3c films vid on this
If Michael does go on a rampage I hope it's better than Rob zombie's Halloween
Let's fucking go!!!
Great trailer but it showed to much!
Are those the same masks from Halloween 3 season of the witch???
A group of strong firemen with deadly tools couldn’t overpower him?
Laurie: Evil dies tonight  Me: Actually there’s another sequel coming next year  Laurie: Damn it
HES NOT PLAYING THE FUCK AROUND BRO
Universal Pictures really has a taste for horror films.   Halloween Kills  Candyman  Last Night in Soho
Damn first thing Shang-Chi now this!!! Everyone's dropping trailers today!!! I can't Fuckin wait for this!!! I just hope it hasn't got the woke infection that some of Blumhouses other recent movies have been spreading, seeing that they said it's a statement on society today and the year 2020 in general 🙄😑💣 it should be about Michael Myers hacking up the Strode family and anyone that gets in his way... Green promises that but he also promised the other part... Hopefully it's more about the production title of the movie mob rules where it's going to be reflecting on the year 2020 people gathering in mobs and doing things like the town of Haddonfield will gather into a huge mob and go after Michael. Either way can't Fuckin wait!!!
I went to see the 2018 movie in theaters and it was good! I hope this one is good too!
"The more he kills, the more he transcends"  I LOVE THAT!!!
OMG Yes!!!!!!
Wow straight up 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 cant wait for this
w
Why do I feel like this trailer showed entirely too much?
AMAZING!!!
LAURIE: LET IT BURN ME: PLEASE DONT 🥺
Silver shamrock masks I knew it was them
Legendary!! 😱
Okay so that was a lot to take in
oh hell yea IM FUCKING READY
HYPE!!
Ok
Oh my God I can't wait they actually filmed this in my town
Why did y’all show nearly all of the kills in it 😂😂
We literally got the Shang-Chi trailer 45 minutes ago and now we got the trailer for this!
This technically the longest Halloween. Point for those that get the Batman reference.
Holy shit!!!
Does Laura tell them that Michael is their uncle
This looks like it’s gonna be the best one in the entire franchise
🗣LET IT BURN 🔥🔥🔥
Gotta love the Silver Shamrock masks making an appearance.
It’s an amazing trailer. But damn, did they have to show most of the kills in the movie? What a way to ruin the hype and suspense.
YAAAAASSSSSSSSS 🎃🎃🎃🔪🔪🔪
This is what I've been waiting for ! #TheBoogeymanIsComing
OH MY GOD YES
1:12 I felt THAT one in MY neck.
Amazing but perhaps shows a little too much?
It no longer looks like a comedy movie.
Wow
Barley still in june nd already getting into that spooky spirit 🎃🎃🎃
I'm unstoppable
HELL YES
Cannot wait for this one! Loved the hell out of the previous one and cant wait to see whats coming next
This is gonna be one of the most fun movies ever I guarantee it

Masterpiece
Hes coming to get his revenge. Hes not going to stop til he kills Laurie.
This bussin bussin the horror I love it

They could have picked a better title.. but it looks pretty good
the more that Michael waits for this movie, the more violent he becomes
This has actually got me hyped for this, let’s f*cking go
Ohhh, I can NOT wait for this!
YASS!
Can't wait baby
Yeah... Michael Myers has to be in his 70s by now... Time to kill him for good.
40 years later, even in a new timeline, Michael is coming for Laurie back in the hospital. But this time, she’s not alone. Also, nice little reference to the H3 Season of the Witch masks.
damn this looks good
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yes yes 👍
Dope! 🍿👍🏽👌🏽
I know for one thing that this guy doesn’t guy 😂😂
I bet you anything that last shot of Laurie saying I’m coming to get you is the last shot and dialogue of the movie after Michel kill her daughter.
🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃 this looks so good Bruhh
SO FUCKIN SICK!  KEEP THIS ENERGY GOING!
Oh man I can’t wait to see Michael get his revenge 😈   Halloween couldn’t come any sooner

The way Michael walked outta that house👌🔥
I knew Universal Pictures couldn’t resist.
Let’s go can’t wait
POG MOMENT
1:31, Halloween 3 Reference
Omfg
T AMO JAME LEE
This shows Michael at his full potential. An unstoppable evil force of nature.  Edit: Woah there, hold up on the toxic comments. This is a Halloween movie, not The Shape vs. Mama's boy with a big machete. Yes, Michael is part human part supernatural as portrayed in the original Halloween movie, but let's not compare completely different universes to the Halloween franchise, whether one is stronger or not, I don't give a shit and The Boogeyman is more evil than Jason anyways. Not to mention, not all Halloween movies are canon.
I’m back
FUCKING YES!
Is that the bogeyman
I'm screaming
What a trailer
Hell yeah
Can’t wait to see this! The director or one of the writers had said that this will be a bloody movie and that Michael will be killing 30 or more than 30 people
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
First
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOO!!!
هلااا يالربعع شلونكم شني نايمين كاعدين وين ماوين 😈😂💘
