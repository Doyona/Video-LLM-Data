its my birthday today as well, so this is my birthday gift to you all :D
ill be honest, that prison is horribly designed, like worst respawn system EVER, and if you sneak a pearl in you just pearl through the gap the gaurds use to see you. tbh if you can sneak even a single item into a prison its already escapable, bring an enderchest and you have full kit
4:50 the HARDEST song and one liner i’ve ever seen.
Im Building NEPTUNES VAULT IN BEDROCK WHEN ITS DONE I CHALLENGE U TO IT
Bro this was better than film on Netflix
Best escape i ever seen
wait, could the guard not pearl through the viewing window and upp into the bed drop chute to get to the bedtrap?
0:15 You know what else is massive?
tnt edit was cold
5:39
I CAME
guards cog 1 iq
Surprised this isn’t built by SeenSven
Wow
Wow that Mythrodak guy was really edgy. I hear he took a break from this Youtube stuff to mature a bit…
What song plays at 0:00? I can’t find it anywhere and other commenters haven’t mentioned it?
pov: the doom music kicks jn
What is the song in the intro :p
Pov: this is the most saf-                         a random man whit 1 mere stick: THIS PRISON to hold ME?
12:47 the most badass thing ivory will ever do
Happy birthday 🎈
i love the Doom soundtrack!🤘
Damn the punchline is lit
How silly that the beginning myth got jumped.
Hi ivory or mythrodak?
7:30 he’s in the walls. HES IN THE GODAMN WALLS!!
Pretty good use of doom music😊
normal people: oH mY gOd i EsCaPeD aN oBsIdIaN bOx  Mythrodak/Ivory:
happy birthdway
POV: When bfg division starts playing
even tho its scripted its sick
I remember when this Video was uploadet and since then I watched this video like 20 times xD it’s still so good❤
What did you do to mythrodak
I cant believe its been 2 years since this banger came out
Wait this is Mythrodak?
why they transphobic calling you boi
5:10 Red Myt- Escapie
Best chess game
wait what happened to mythrodak guy?
Who the fuck is Ivory
Man this looks like a move🫡🫡🫡🫡💯💯
BRO IS HIM
5:05 AGAIN WITH THE FUCKING AWESOME LINE
“Checkmate” my favorite line
Bro that gave me tingles
This is the best escape yet, it was so epic gg mythrodac 😎
couldent the guards pearl glitch through(idk about their kits but the barrel is filled with them)   edit: i was rewatching all the escapes edit #2: where did your pick come from?
what *exact* soundtracks are used in this video  I know they come from doom games, but those have dozens of tracks and I’m too lazy to find them all
These prison escapes were the goat they will be missed 😔
Escape north korea
Ivory, command blocks can be gotten(but not placed/used) according to Sci-craft
i love how this kicks off like "put me back i havent finished my intro yet"
Kinda miss Mythrodak, in a way which tries to avoid upsetting everyone I mean nothing against Ivory, but these prison escapes were my crutch through quarantine
4:33 bro Mythro just got the Speedrun world record and explained how to do it in 10 seconds
the part where you blew up the prison was absolutely epic
where did he get the pikaxe from? 10.24
ayee the doom soundtrack!!
The good old time when he was a normal person
Ivory is low key mcguyver of minecraft
where did the pickaxe came from? you said, that the guards have non in theyr equip station and it wasn´t in your ec neither
Wow her voice sounds so different from here what a change
ive wondered, what if you dont set ur spawn? what are they gonna do, kill you? you die just being imprisoned to make sure you dont have any items
that ending was so cringe. like who says checkmate? you could have said anything else and it would be cool
I’m honestly not even a fan of Minecraft, but this was awesome . Well done , entertaining and intense as hell. Love the work, new subscriber from a non MC fan !😅
Bro was walking away from the prison with explosions behind him. What a Chad.
INSANE. he blew up the prison :0
I love how he got knocked out and brought straight in the the cell in the beginning to brag how he could escape without any items 😎😎
I was jamming to the doom music during the escape
homie's escape plan is literally just "i am in your walls"
Them: Jokes on you the prision is made of netherite and obisian. hah
legend
Obsidian does take only 4~ minutes to break with fist but surely prison that is a little bit better would have eldeer guardians
“My skin is mostly black” is that racist?
Try to escape bedrock box.
Ivory????
R u a girl?
I still can’t find anyone built Kratos’ vault 💀
amazing
Hey if Ivory you see this, my question, if they had used a pressure plate for the detection of respawning or observers, I think you might have been unable to escape, as they, unlike redstone ore do not have a cooldown.
2:23, plumpkin says "im saving them"
Dude ı really love theis series
*8:53* 👌
It's not fair you oof a project that someone worked hard on :(
Ares is the god of war. If war is what they want, it's what they'll get." Boss music kicks in
Theee videos were cool until he became a 🏳️‍⚧️
the Doom music gives me such Percy Jackson Ares vibes!
The intro was so long my dad came back from getting milk.
bro showed em
I punch big red button then make alt x50 and press big red button. Me want see big smile.
OMG
Like they say revenge is a dish best served cold
Your videos just have the BEST music
Ending unlocked: badass scapist
Ivory destroying the prison at the end of the video is perhaps the most girlboss thing I've seen her do so far
stop being a d*mb b*tch and be a man again... believe u bro
Yoooo! That’s so epic!
checkmate.
Oh no the doom misic
The best prison video of the world
Gggggggggggg
Like a movie
the best thing ever                    MUSIC:              edit: i can hear that it's got the only thing they fear is you    in it Doom OST (2016) - Mick Gordon Doom Eternal OST - Mick Gordon
she has good taste in music
At the part about the elder guardians, she really went from 😊 to 👿
Notice me senpai
The intro was fire❤️🔥
Person: builds a prison Ivory: Oh boy here I go escaping again
Ivory should make his own prison to imprison all the guards in the story REVENGE !!!!
The most deadliest prison thats so huge but such small passages legitimately leading to the exit.
Ares actually had a softer spot for war prisoners because he was once held prisoner so if you mistreated your war prisoners ares would be very mad
That tnt explosion felt like a Danganronpa execution scene, this cinematography is amazing
I can escape ANY !!! Just leave the game. Or just dont click any beds
Next prison Olympus: it's about 30 x 30 chunks, there's a 5 block wall made of crying obsidian to build limet and no roof, it has trees and water, basically no prison stuff and its just a small survival world
make a version without editing
lame
One issue, how did he get a pickaxe at 10:26? He didn't have one right before the cut and he said there was no access to pickaxes, even for guards.
Did anyone else notice how the intro only ends halfway through the video 5:06
“Not only is it huge, it’s also extremely secure”   Th-th-that’s what she said :D
You are the first person that made me sub by asking
Please tell me why he changes is youtube name
Anyone else notice the Easter egg hidden in the glitching at 2:23?
this video is made really well : )
why is his name now IvoryTV or is this not the originall idk
"Ares is the god of war...   If it's war they want, it's war they get."  Mr. Incredible becoming canny phase 8 music kicks in
i laughted so hard at "so basically how it works is u push big red button number go higher and Mythrodak is big happy"
This guy is the embodyment of all they fear is you but they is the prisons he disappears from
Music Used In This Video: The Only Thing They Fear Is You BFG Division Cultist Base
2:19 ivory did you just say the f word
I like the doom 2016 music
POV: the guards leave the world and survives the explosion from leaving
that’s 13 mins i’m not getting back
Nice video, Ivory. :)
Hi ivory
i thought he said the guards didn't have pickaxes
when the prison was blowing up, i felt all my anger showering off my body, i felt epic!!
The doom rights non-respected 😅
I ABSOLUTELY loved the video all the clips and everything was soo well made keep up the good work Mythrodak and  Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you!!!
that was pretty deadly
Do the demention prison escape
Remember you could just deconect
OH- OK-
Doom music
cool
Did anyone else see plumpkin's face and the words "I'M SAVING THEM"
"If its war they want...It's war they'll get" *Doom music kicks in*  Guards: "Why do I hear boss music?"
This man be escaping everything
Well... he's a girl... soooooooo....
“It’s fairly large” that’s what she said😂
I loved the checkmate moment
the end gave me shivers, this guy is good
What was that doom song he played? I can't find it anywhere
now ivory. I miss the old mythrodak but I wanna see what ivory can do
5:10 When the Vault Becomes Canny
Just to say, your editing is the best bloody editing I’ve seen on YouTube! It’s great!
She is so good! She's smart!
beginning: normal voice ; lore:*deep voice*
lol she became ivory after this
This gives me nice escapists nostalgia
YESSS THE DOOM MUSIC
great work ivory!
Mythrodak is female
Wow so this is THE video where you found out. I wish you good luck on your transgender journey, Ivory ! :D
Ok well now watching this after your under the mask vid I feel bad❤❤❤ we love you and support all your choices
Happy birthday
love the doom music
I love the editinng
the doom music tho
Doom was the perfect music for this
why do you have an pickaaxe you said the gaurds only get armor gapples and weapons. and how do you nkow where evreything is? but thats fine i subbed and liked love your vids
Ironically, if the guard hadn't broken that obsidian, it might have shielded him from the blast so he would survive.
I saw you on the lemoncloud kitpvp part of the server and kept killing you.
Area’s not god of war smhh
This has got to be the absolute most sick escape yet
0:34 :D
Music name?
Damn that music is so dramatic
''Escaping Minecraft's Deadliest Prison'' Literally told how you could escape this prison in the first 4 mins
you explained everything except how u how u got the pickaxe because u said that the guard set didn’t have any pickaxes in their kit and their wasn’t a pickaxe in ur enderchest
Lmao I tried to copy the design of this but failed (the same cell design, everything is away and ur on a platform) because I suck at redstone
“Checkmate”  -best part of the video
achievment unlocked: how did I get here 1:03
If the gourds had pearl glitched through the obsidian.
i feel bad for da bulders e
12:09 FNAF 6 but they use bombs instead of fire
i made mytro big happy (:<
2:50 "and there we're *stairs* with *long hallways* "
This was the most epic video.. But the funniest at the same time
AMAZING!
I absolutely loved every second of this video. Especially the savageness of the escape combined with the doom music and the editing. This is in my opinion by far your best video on the channel. And i've seen escaping the abyss
Plot twist: He is a movie maker
HOW THE FUCK DID YOU DO THIS IT WAS SO IINTENSE I LIKED IT BRO ITS SO INTENSE WHEN YOU BLEW UP THE WHOLE PRISON AHHHHHHH SO INTENSE
He Cheated and randomly was given a pick, look at 10:30 in his 3rd slot.
BRO im so fuckin hyped rn! AMAZING video!
Casually cute to chill and funny voice to now cinematic metal music and voice also going cinematic
this is so fucking sick
you will never kill me...  I'M ON XBOX HAHAHAAAA.
Damn! That edit with the tnt at the end is a true work of art!
WHY IS THIS VIDEO SO LOUD  sorry was i yelling?
like i know the script was good but..........CAN WE JUST TALK ABOUT THE EDITING AS WELL
4:52 when the doom music comes on
12:43 Lol why do I feel bad for this guy.. Like he was trying his best to live by destroying as much tnt (2 blocks) as possible...  Edit: Dont give me hate it's my opinion..
After "Escaping the abyss" you start to feel somewhat bad for the guards XDD
Man had to improve the prison with commands just to make it harder, man’s to good
12:05
This guy just keeps proving that you can’t make a perfect prison. It is always possible to escape. Just with the right plan
The best video in the history !!!!!!!!!!!!
Happy birthday! 🎉(I am a bit late)
when the doom music kicks in
ha
Who is here after the latest escape from the Abyss?
Happy pooooooooooooop day
loving the doom music man
DAMN NICE MUSIC DOOOOOOOOM ETERNAL
Mythrodak: Says smth reasonable  jjkay03: *B U T  I T  C O U L D*
Hi
to not get in any prison like this you just                dont need to click any bed
10:31 No pickaxe as he said that the armour and gear equip station only provide Armours, Gapples and Swords  10:35 He have a PICKAXE and I mention that he don't have pickaxe in hi ender chest 🌝 CHEATY CHEATY 🌝  NoiCe Video though 🔥
2:17-3:00 slight flash/epilepsy warning
The ending is epic!!!!!
The ending is epic!!!!!
5:10 MRINCREDIBLE BECOMES CANNY REFRENCE 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😱😳😳😳😱😳😳😱😳😳😱😳😱
Made it look ez
These editing skills are amazing  and the explanation for the escaping part was far beyond my knowledge!
0:32 "you push big red button, number go higher, mythrodak is big happy"
DOOM
you already know its good when that doom music kicks in
2:23 "I'm saving them"...
In the "blowing up the prison" part, what was the music you used?
I already love the doom ost, but put over a prison escape was better.
music good
You said that obsidian takes roughly 5 minutes to break. You only had 10 minutes to get out because the guards needed to break 2 obsidian in order to make their way.
Prison go boom boom
10:51 Yes you do its 5 mins you said that earlier in the vid
So cool
Great job love the vids  Happy birthday!
jesus it feels like watching death note in minecraft
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Getya popcorn this is such a Great escape
Cinematic editing is great. The bit where we hear your inner monologue while the guard is talking is a nice touch.
Your production Quality is honestly insane for a Minecraft Youtube channel. Thank you for lighting up my day.
is it illegal to say that doom music goes hard? because it does
Just saying. Am i the only one who noticed that he said the guards dosent have a pickaxe bit egen he go into the armour machine thing he hets one
this is awesome I love the  vibe. the easy way to escape is funny
Best choice of music.
Hell yeah I enjoyed that one! Just discovered you Myth... Binge watching your channel right now... Keep it up! ¥(+_-)
Happy birthday mythrodak and also you have the most sick music
I looove your edits
There are no chains for this man. For every prison, a flaw is created for him to exploit
I love the music u make it's awesome like u
Mythrodak:they won't see me cause it's dark and my skin is mostly black Me:racist!!!
Happy birthday I love ur videos and how u make it like a movie o/ and hi
How do you edit these sooooooooo well
This guy used the shadows on the decoration blocks to escape this.
Why is no one talking about the entry recap glitching? And I swear I saw something saying "I'm saving them." In there. Is this lore? I feel like it's lore.
movie. minecraft movie.
Mythrodak would make a good minecraft robber that robs super secure vaults
Mythrodak you are my favourite Minecraft youtuber
now when he said ares is the god of war i was like nah kratos is
i give big happy\
You Know mythrodak is serious when he uses the doom ost
I understand why you use Doom Eternal music
Wait, were did he get the pickaxe?
We vibin then the doom music kicks in😳
Woa this one was epic since you didnt just break bed to respawn outside
People could just not set their respawn point in the prison and when they get killed they just respawn back at spawn but this is much more epic
"I'm Saving them" I think it said
DOOM music just kicks in
when the doom music kicks in LOL
It's not a Mistake✨ It's a Masterpiece✨
Myth you are epic
So epic!!!
Modern Minecraft Houdini
I like how he shows himself placing tnt, and then he just says "checkmate" doom music kicks in
When the doom music kicks in
Wow mythrodak is either a son of athena or a son of poseidon cus he is smart and resourceful
Who was that behind him at 0:45?
Bruh the ending speach was so hype
Checkmate.
I love how he used doom music
Bruh he said that this prison was the  deadliest prisons of all, but after he left he made it even more dangerous. How? TNT!!!!!!!
Wouldn't the guards be able to glitch through the obsidian? It might have been better just to keep them where they are.
Why don’t prisons use Ender pearl stasis chambers for the prisoners it would be so easy to teleport them back into the room and just kill them or trap em again
8:52 laughed because it’s kinda racist
Mythrodak scares me
Op
i love doom music
Love how he introduces My favourite greek god Ares.... Theres no way i'm unsubbing now :)
Yo was that the Bfg division soundtrack?
this is my second time watching it and i found a flaw in your escape. not a big serious one but still. you said that the guards dont get a pickaxe but you got it randomly i mean you didnt even get it from the guards chamber it just appeard in your inventory at 10:25.
look at his mouse pointer.... is he on MAC?
Mythrodak is so badass, the way he said "checkmate" was just awesome.
0:35 i see open source software so i am also big happy and push big red button
The end was the best part because I love explosions.
And from this ender chest I grab a win
10:25 BEDWARS YOOOOOO
5:20 bruh this song is used for memes
Where tf did he get that pickaxe, it wasn't in his enderchest or the armor equip Station
Goddamn he is a real criminal mastermind bro
Mythrodak... have you ever considered building your own prison?
Beat guardians vault
The Doom music :D
I think mythidorak should escape a prison called guardians vault. It was made purely for him and its a smoking piece of rubbish
When the DOOM music kicks in
WAIT YOUR BIRTHDAY IS JUNE 5!  SO IS MINE!
Loved it!  Happy Late Birthday shoutout!
CRINGE
This Man Could Literally Escape A Prison IN RL In Less The 3 Days
12:46 OH MY DAYS THE QUALITY AND THE CUTS OML YOUR AMAZING MYTHRODAK  UNDERRATEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Why do they even try at this point? Like, Seriously. Why??????? xD When will they get the message?                                          YOU CANT IMPRISON THE LEGEND THAT THEY CALL    MYTHRODAK
11:48  Mythrodak. You're one devious boy.
5:02 OML I CANT EVEN THE CUTS IN ALL HIS VIDEOS ARE JUST LEGENDARY OMG THANK YOU SO MUCH MYTHRODAKKKKK
i wish i knew how to edit like that
This channel is awesome. He is using big IQ to break out of prisons that are meant to hold you forever; not like prisons meant to be  escapable (not sure if that’s a word.
this is how it works: "push big red button, number go higher, mythrodak is big happy..." that convinced me lol
10:30 he spawned pickaxe
His videos r greater than movies
4:52  THE GUARD FEAR IS MYTHROADAK
12:30 dang, i watched that too many times
That intro was clever. Well played 👏🏽
what a good video, id say, your best
Nice cheating Mythrodak, this is very convincing
Wow 6 months later i got a birthday gift but im late so i give subscribe
"Im gonna break these soul sand" Me: thats soul soil
I will study this video
coulda sworn i was subbed before, but at least i am now! love your content mythrodak However, i will never forgive you for killing jefory
That last part was super cool
I made a prison how can I submit it to you? I really wanna do it.
the editing was so good my lil brother is dancing on the floor
Fun fact.     he say guards don't get pickaxe but when he get armour and weapons from wardens room he also got a pickaxe
anyone else got scared when he blew up the whole prison with the guards trapped inside and he said "checkmate" so coldly?
Dude this editing is god level.
Anyone know the song name at 5:25 ?
bhla bola bhla
I love your videos!!!
The end tho
This video has kill it with fire vibes
He ended the war with a bang indeed
4:53 musci name pls?
Bro didn't only leave the prison but took maxed out gear and free stuff with him
0:19 sus entrance
*12:48* Wow. I see you were put in prisons for a reason. What a mad man!
Is this a movie ? In neflex ??????????
Well this is awesome.
No one is allowed to reply this
at the end i really thought this instantly turned into some sort of prison escape movie xd
12:47 CheckMate
This guy should make a movie
He loses in Gaia's vault
This is the type of person to have level 20 mastery in every level of hitman 1,2 and 3
Happy birthday 🥳 Mythrodak
Nyeh Escape with mining faitque was lot BETTER
HOLY MOLY
Cinematic, I like it
OH HE'S INSANE!
Bruh the last park as he says checkmate
Pog
Where did he got the pickaxe from ?
Wow this is insane
Yo this is sick
love that doom music
epico
Nooo what a vedio I'm shaking
Thank you for asking us to subscribe and not FORCING US TO
"checkmate"
Now that I finally just started playing doom, I can finally truly pay the doom music kicking in
2:18 anyone else notice he said "fucked" Xd
This is better than squid game in my opinion
That prsion looks like a libary/college and a court
How’d you get that enchanted netherite picaxe?
I just forgot THIS IS A FREAKING LORE!!!
I thought he said the guards had no pickaxes.  *There are e-chests in the guard rooms*
They should just make it so you have to screen share your Minecraft so they know that all your items are gone and ur not up to anything while ur going through the security smh
gg ez
When the doom music kicks in:
Nice
when the doom music keep kicks in
this is a whole movie
my question is why is mythrodak so wanted by these people
this is easily your best video
really good video honestly
Pandora's vault, Gaia's vault, poisedon's vault, ares's vault, titan's vault, hade's vault, How many vault next? A vault's vault?
Lets go he used the best music ever
yea gaias vaults better
My favorite part is the TNT at the end.
“So, I’m going to have to escape this prison with nothing in my inventory, with my world spawn set inside the bed trap, and with the guards looking straight at me. Ares was the god of war, and if it’s a war they want, then it’s a war they’ll get.” Mythrodak being really badass.
i like teh doom music
One question when you were in the guards hall you randomly got a pickaxe
Checkmate --- Sun Tzu, the art of war
Not subbing, I think you have enough.  Editing is pretty cringe too.
i love how at the end he just says checkmate
Bro, you are one hell of a director. Subscribed.
Legendary
So cool
These are more like mini films
subbed long ago
That checkmate at the the end was sick
Rip ares vault got blown up
I don't even play Minecraft that much and I could easily make a prison far more effective than this
How did he randomly acquire a pickaxe , he didn’t get one from the equip station or his ended chest ?
Bruh you should make longer contents, really looked like a movie 🎬
"Checkmate." -Mythrodak 2021 12:26
Ares the God of War
Escape your bed right after you wake up
Wait can you just fake click the bed then die and get outside?
Zeus voult be like Bedrock box
You deserve more subbs
I LIKE IT
F to all the guards
Ok.. that 'Checkmate' was clucking badass
It was like a movie
how ?!?!?!?!?!? you make minecraftvideos how do i get goosebums huh ?!?!?? how do you make these incredible scene ?!?!?!? ur soooo good at it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111
U can break obsidian netherite with beer hands
i can escape in 1 minute.  heres the tutorial: step 1: leave step 2: log out of ur mc  step 3: get ur alt Only If Needed: step 4: ask for whitelist (if server is whitelist on) step 5: join the server with ur alt step 6: its done :)
when the doom music kicks in
Checkmate.
Ok but how did you get a pickaxe
he said a swear
I have a idea for a much more secure prison
Me when someone kills my pet dog in minecraft: 12:48
HOW SRE YOU SO GOOD???
Why you're not dsmp member i would die to watch your lore🙃
hảo hán
MythrodakTV is a brand.
So how much metal music do you want?  Mythrodak: Yes.
4:56 doooooooooom saundtrack. i cant remember what it was cald lol.
What is the song name at 5:10?
This is actually very cool
"If its a war they want its a war they get!"  Me: *pisses my pants and calls my mom to come get me*
The ending was so satisfying
lol i swear one day this guy will be known for the guy who cant be kept in prison since he'll keep escaping it and i mean in real life by the way
1M iq lol
But there’s one last thing I had to do before I left: monologue
"The wrath of the God of war, was on my side all this time! Now perish like all those who oppose me and my destiny to rule!"
i cant wait for you to blow up
dam
yay doom eternal music lolol
The cellmate every prisoner wants to have
WHAT IF THE GUARDS HAVE PICK IN THERE ENDER CHEST
mythro escaped that prison like he was playing chess
This man is a genius
The ultimate prison: the entire world  You cannot escape it (logging out doesn't count), deleting doesn't work (cause your character is still stuck)  MythrodakTV: figures out how to break the world border without commands
What's the music at 12:48?
dude that doom track fitted too well man that sounded epic
smart idea for the prison while they go through the protocols to get in the cell make the prisoner throw a ended-earl into a e pearl stasis chamber so if they try to escape the guards can pull a lever.
Did you know the soundtrack when mythrodak blows up the prison is the music for the game DOOM?
Mythro, the God of escaping prisons.
This is too cool for a minecraft vedio
you really do have to wonder how this man keeps getting captured when he has access to all this gear
Cool
Ares: god of war  Mythrodak:  god of escaping JJ: god of BUT IT COULD?????
Michael Scofield: *ez*
That checkmate was fudging sick
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BLOWS ME AWAY GET THIS MAN AN AWARD HE TOPS ALL OTHERS
When you remember tnt can’t break obsidian
Just remember, it’s meant to have elder guardians this means that the guard will already have gotten to you because with miner fatigue taken a day
This is lvl: 99999999999999999 editing
I have chills…
THE CINEMATICS ARE EPIC BRO WELL DONE!!,
Mythrodak; makes an escape plan Guards; why do i hear doom music-
Best vid I have ever seen
Respect. (Happy B day!!!)
Nice editing bro
Try to kill technoblade
with mining fatigue 3 mythrodak only used 11 sec to escape lol
I like how there's doom eternal music in the background I WALKED FROM ONE ROOM TO ROOM doom eternal music intensifies
You did not put anything in your ender chest.
Let’s just appreciate how much effort this guy puts into his videos. Love you man
I love your vids plz make more! Sub too😊
i love the way you editing your videos, this shit is epic
i loved that ending
u laggin bro?                                                                               (i know he's not lagging it's just an edit)
Random bully with creative: *Puts player in bedrock cage* Well that was easy
Imagine this guy in an actual prison xd)
That "Checkmate" was so badass
whats the song?
4:50 when the doom music kicks in
0:57 i still need an explanation on what word he says
if the guards equipment didnt give pickaxes then why when you took one of their equipments it also gave you a netherite pick
the best part is you get free gear
Man If there were cobwebs you would not have been able to perform an escape.
TNT: *YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET*
the "checkmate" gave me the chills.
Loo
Lol ur smart
Wow lolol
This relies a lot on guards not having pickaxes or enderpearls
Every air block can be enderpearled glitched too with enough gapples though so they wont be frantically trying to get you they will just pearl glitch to you and kill you
6:42 ashame they dont have enderchests with a pick of their own
The guards cant come in the prison in time to get me. Also guard: breaks glass after 20 seconds and enderpearls and kills mythro ending his escape
And i took out the entire guard force by trapping them in obsidian. It will take 5 minutes for them to break out. Also guards: Enderpearls out of obsidian and overwhelms mythrodak
they really shouldn't leave ender chests lying around
Happy birthday
10:45 this is why i put efficiency 5 on my sword smh
Man this is soo like a series i really love it and thebway he said checkmate was littearly the most cool thing 🤯🤯
i literally said "DOOM! HAHAHHAHHAAAA" 1 second into the video
Happy b-day also the 'b' stands for ⬇️       Block
I hear doom music itbwcoms war
watching your prison escape videos are giving me PTSD from the time i tried to escape my OWN PRISON and spent hours punching obsidian
I know how to break out of a prison, just dont click any bed and die, then you can just spawn outside the vault
damn, I wouldn't figure out a plan, and if I did, I would feel bad for exploding it.
yas doom music
12:47. Top 10 most epik scenes in Minecraft. "Checkate"
TF SO GOOOD
4:53 the only thing they fear is you, COOL
This whole series feels like a movie
The only thing they fear is you
Ending is epic 😍🔥
5:10 song name????
"Death Note" planning levels are going off charts!
Im so addicted to your vids 🙂
Am I the only one who relised the pumklin easter egg for one frame?  the one at 2:23
0:35 makes my cry
is this rigged?
It was like he was agent 47 (it is a game )
Why the fuck would you put wood in ur stupid obsidian prison thats stupid lmfao and why would you put Ender pearls and TNT in the fucking dispenser
i love how doom music starts playing
Just another normal day for mythrodak
Idk who you are but I love your music tastes
Escapes the prison, proceeds to blow it up. I expected nothing less.
how do you do this stuff?
Danggg the edits
THIS IS TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO INSANE AND COOL
this is just too good like tooo good
the EDITING and the ATMOSPHERE and the WORLDBUILDING bro I'm in awe I love this
Blowing up the prison was my favorite part
when the doom music  kicks in
The most dramatic ending I ever seen
That ending
I cant imagine better content
I will give u a prison to try bedrock edition
“I want a challenge, so I’m going to set my spawn in the prison”  Like the prison isn’t hard to escape at all 😂
Gemini’s vault should be the next
Happy birthday man here’s my give to you a sub
Damn okay that was pretty badass
i subbed once i saw this, this is so cool
YESSSSS THE DOOM ETERNAL MUSIC
at the end was epic         he was just like      chackmate.
5:10 rip headphone users
I love the music
Bruh doom music
Imagine Seensven comes and arrest Mythrodak in rl
Can anyone tell me the name of the intense song in that he used?
B r u h
yeah i tried the new version of the ares vault and you can't even get to the bed, the bed is obstructed... if you die you will just respawn at the worldspawn
Trolled
I appreciate the doom music
Love the Mr. Robot intro :D Great work!
13:14 the fact that you can't even tell what's going on from the outside is so ominous lol
Its all fun and games till that doom internal music kicks in
0:36 That is the most cursed immage I’ve ever seen
RIP jjkay
That beat drop like your playing doom 🤣
when the Doom music kicks in:
Just like over simplified bud it doesn’t but it could x1 million
Extremely dramatic
Not only escaping but ROBBING THE PRISON OF IT'S GEARS AS WELL?!
why are the based of gods
How can a minecraft Video be sooo epic. Great editing!
When he said, "Who's next?"  I got chills throughout my whole body.  This entire series has felt like prequels to movies that haven't been released to the public yet.
I just found Mythrodak and he's amazing.
What editing program do you use?
the doom music tho
did he just try to blow up obsidian?
u just gained a sub
Why isn’t there a zeus vault? He is the lightning god after all.
FINALLY 1080P60FPS.
bruh u escaped like a bigilion prisons lol, when u said that u putet tnt everywere i was like oooooooooooo thats like 10000 iq play!
da doom music tho
Checkmate, THAT IS THE BEST BEFORE-KILL LINE I HAVE EVER HEARD.
"u push big red button" yeah okay fine, that gave me a chuckle
The song where he blows up the prison is soooo bop!
Those stupid guards got into a checkmate
why he makes everything soo kool i can watch this 10 times
IDIOCY Never put any pearl stasis chamber, redstone shafts, OR VITAL COMPONENTS NEAR THE RESPAWN TRAP OR CELL! If your to lazy to put elder guardians, your most likely to lazy to make a good prison.  NEVER USE BLOCKS LIKE REDSTONE ORE TO ACT HAS YOUR SENSOR! EVER
Ok that was brilliant but how he got pik if the guards dint nevertheless he sill used it to mine observer which was easy to break without but still
The spotless vision comparably talk because lawyer dewailly wrap given a disastrous regret. painstaking, enormous action
The blowing up part was so cool LOL
5:10 YEAAAAAAAAAA
13:00 the music here really gets your adrenaline kicking and gives you a million goosebumps
Nice vid
"Checkmate" Best. Line. Ever.
By far the most destructive prison escape yet!
can ı use your mınecraft skin
this is fake and cringe as hell
Bro, the ending was soooooooooooooooooooooooo Good
i thought we cant place blocks
when the doom music kicks in
Lol this suddenly became a movie about escaping and :)
When the doom music kicks in. Quite literally.
YOOOO THE ENDING WAS SO COOL AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! I REALLY LOVE YOUR VIDEOS <3
this channel is soo underrated
The builder using the excuse of the prison Could have elder guardians isn't right given how the command block ain't a elder guardian and honestly it is just lazy given how in survival it isn't possible
This is the most fucking epic prison escape i've ever seen
This is literally the stupidest thing ever. He’s “escaping from a prison” in a freaking block game. SO WHY IS HE THID GOOD AT MAKING IT SO ENTERTAINING
0:26 haha yhea do it.
Everone gangsta till the doom music starts playing
2:23 plumpkin says “I’m saving them”
this is an inescapable prison mythodak: no
You got my sub for the doom music js
YOU PRISON-BUILDING FOOLS, YOU'RE MAKING HIM STRONGER! Seriously, that "Who's next?!" at the end gave me shivers! Mythrodak, you're awesome!
lol your editing is like how good i am at walking
DOOM ETERNAL MUSIC YEEEAAAAHHHH
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE VAULTS NAMED AFTER GREEK WIERDOS?!
Why is his name hishatori his name is a name of some one who was wrongly said he was a murder and escaped 3 prisons
Music name?
if its a war they want, its a war theyll get.  THE ONLY THING ANYONE FEARS IS YOU
THE TRANSITION IS SO GOOD HERE SUBSCRIBE TO HIM PLZ.
The video design tho...
if only this man know how a real pirsson works
this was super entertaining.
Just put somewon in a 2 blocks bedrock box and theru u go make sure he has nothing
OP
u should make a prison where your stuck in a box full of water with a diamond helmet with curse of binding and respiration 3 and a beacon with regeneration 2 that way you can never die and will stay inside the box for eternity
jjkay30:"inescapable Prison" Mythrodak: hold my milk bucket
Your welcome
you should really become a movie director, I love your scriptwriting and editing style.
4:32   did anyone realize that the doom eternal and doom music started here and was there till the video ended (btw i am a big fan of that game)
Doom
What if you just left click the bed
The ending looks like a K-drama revenge scene.
People take months to build prisons my guy straight up blew months of work
After 999999 years I figured out this    is a live stream
At about 2:23, there’s an image of a jack-o-lantern with the message: I’m saving them. Foreshadowing
The end was amazing! “Checkmate”😎
is there only 1 guard?
Mythrodak editing tho
Everyone: Dream has 100 iq.  Me: Then mythrodak has 1000 iq.  How does he find a way to escape every prision *With a challenge*
u can make a bedrock prison but ok 👍🏼
Respect...
8:50 "im very hard to see cos my skin is black" meanwhile the guard with 1000 % brightness
Rlly used doom music
Nice
"checkmate" hasent been so badass
Love the doom music
the doom music was rlly good, it rlly matched the vid <3
Last music name
why make big complicated prison just put him in a bedrock box
The DOOM music makes this 10,000,000,000× cooler. B)
If one of the guards wouldn’t break the obsidian they would survive
badass
Give this guy more subs
“Check mate” best phrase lol
12:48 "server.exe has crashed"
*FREAKING BADAS*
Found something weird at 10:28 he does not have a netherite pick in his 3rd slot then at 10:32 he has one.If you look at 10:16 you can see he never got a pick from the wardens armour equipt station and neither from his e chest.Just something weird i found.
B
This is like movie siries
Subs to Mythrodak to give him the Big Happy™️
13:15 me ig
Hi can you do a colab video with Drean
i love the epic music when you were blowing it up xd
"Ares was the god of war and if it's a war they want, it's a war they'll get"     - Mythrodak
Happy birthday, sorry if I was a little late.
0:36 i wanted to but i forgot now you have the extra sub
This Channel deserves an Oscar no kidding
Ares vault just got put on a grill and got cooked.
Sick
The best prison created the dirt prison
but if the pickaxe wasnt in the armor thing how did u get one
5:11 *goosebumps moment*
When the doom music kicks in tho
This is the best one yet
This guy is insane and I like it😎
I just watched a block man break out of prison John wick style
this was my favorite prison escape by far.
Why don't they just not get ender chest
This man is one of the best editors I've ever seen on YouTube, Props to you.
so f***ing nice!!!
I really like your videos and, i know you could do without it, but where did you get your pickaxe from?
Indeed, Checkmate.
Ray Breshlin : Out from prison With Box Of Milk  Mayodark :Redstone
My favorite video on your channel so far. Came for the escape, stayed for the Doom music
jjkay03 is one of the dislikers lol
Holy shit, i got focking goosmubps from that checkmate
Nice bfg division
Mythordak your black cursor is very ugly you can just color a cursor to make it look cooler
That doom soundtrack :D
DAAAAAMMMNNNNN!!!!   That was a bada$$ ending to Ares Vault
Bro that editing is awesome
Bruh u don't have mining fetic
pogger editing
You should have used Holst’s Mars
My question is how can you create such an amazing and deadly prison, yet it looks so beautiful and more like a place for worship than a prison...
Imagine if mythrodak did an irl video of him escaping a real prison
Why does DOOM music work so well for that intro
Normally you wont know the intire layout of the fk prison your escorted too
holy crap I'm scared
EPIC
you KNOW the guards are screwed when mythrodak starts emanating doom music
Wow that was cool
Mythrodak : I'll use the command   Me : /gamemode creative
What a savage, that is fuck*ng amazing.
4:52 this part is just perfect
Nice detail, if you pause on the right frame at 2:23 theres the pumpkin saying "im saving them"
Bad
love the part he placed the tnt, sound effects legit
12:47 Legend moment. This man deserves more than 10 million subs for putting the right music at the right time on his videos! Because of it the video is absolute masterpiece!
When you said “whose next” it randomly inspired me to build a better prison- 👹🔪
OMG
is there any prison which hold mythrodak? i dont think  anybody can beat him
"Whos Next?"
The one thing I needed in life was a Mythrodak video with Doom music.
bruh he pulled a lmanberg
The prison goes boom And BRUHHH
I love how he intentionally made it so he couldn't have any items. That's how confident he was.
you had me at the doom music
6:55 you said the same thing twice
True
Holy fucking Jesus : “checkmate”
It’s epic  10:30
"You don't have to if you don't want to SUBSCRIBE" Im subbing for this line
When doom music kicks in… 5:00
Damn he even did a one liner to finish em of
Am I the only one who hears doom music and immediately wants to play doom after? Yeah? Ok.
dude how is ur pc withstanding the entire prison filled to the brim with tnt
Checkmate. 12:47
5:06 The Only Thing They Fear is You was a good song that fit nicely here
This vid is like a movie
13:02 Imagine having ender pearl but not escaping
I liked the way he said Checked mate.
You know all things considered most of it was made of obsidian so they could rebuild
He said the gear stations didn’t give pickaxes right??
I love how dramatic these videos get.
goosebumps  x1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 times when checkmate
Checkmate scene was legit better than money heist togather
You big brained the crap out of 'em!!!! 😱
*Rock music intensifies*
HOLY MOLY THIS MANS IS THE BIG CHAD
You are smarter than dream
The only thing that makes the Eres impos is the infinite mf3
when the doom music kicks in escapists edition
Mythrodak how did you get a pickaxe you don't have one in ur enderchest or when you got gear?
WOW your voice is so creppy
It's not only big but it's also tasty;)🥵🥶🥶🥶
not only did he escape starting with NOTHING, he robbed them blind, AND THEN destroyed the place. This man is to be feared, even more so than dream or techno in my opinion.
the music in this video should be now known as mythrodaks  theme
how long does it take thinking of these escapes
That doom music tho
GuEsS wHaT. i found the best prison thats better than all of them combined.     /ban
I think I can't hide from him now bro you are a monster I think if you goota stuck at bedrock BIG CUBE you will still escaped but good job and respect 💪
Dude this is better than a 2 hour movie!
Lol, imagine u build such an elaborate prision and a guy decides to make it harder because if he did not set spawpoint he would escape uns seconds
JUST WOW 12:53
Swag legend
Cool editing, Cool Doom music
Omg the doom soundtrack hell yeah
Next: I try to escape a soviet gulag
this whole video is quite literally, when the doom music kicks in
I just love it that everyone is building prisons and mythodak is saying to himself another prison another escape
Push no red button number go up  mythrodak big happy
"Ares is the god of war... If it's war they want, it war they get."   *doom music kicks in*
hey i want you to escape my prison it made by 6 side of bedrock and you are spawn inside of it:))))))
I love the doom music
I love the ending
when the doom eternal music kicks in
This guy takes nothing is impossible wayy to much
Insane. Wow. Speechless
at 10:25 how did you get the pickaxe ?
Cool
yoo man the editing was top notch
DOOM music INTENSIFYES
THe CHeCKMATE AT THE END WAS SO DRAMATIC I LOVED IT
I swear you have like a quote book memorized or smth
If every continent owned one of the prisons escaped by this man, he would be internationally wanted
You are big brain
bro, the audio editing and is so cool. Well done.
this man can escape every prison
Anyone mind telling me what the TNT montage song is?
All of these vaults are based off of greek gods and goddesses. Ares (god of war), Poseidon (god of the sea), and Gaia (mother earth).
These vaults are all based off greek names. Ares (god of war), Gaia (earth), Poseidon (god of the sea).
*POV:* You press big red button, number go higher and Mythrodak big happy
Funny I found this video when I was in the middle of reading Percy Jackson and the olimpians
No prison could hold this man
&!!!- say the word used in sighs
Logon at midnight have a alt acout and alt will break you out all at midnight
you r awesome
Damn what’s the sick djent song at 4:52??  Edit: scratch that all the music in this video is fucking amazing, I need ALL OF THE SONGS
Anyone know how he got the pickaxe
One thing  Amazing
In the last moment he lights all the tnt the guards be like "a shit we dead"
Why does jjkay looks like fundy 😣✋ (From the back)
Inescapable prison: Bedrock 2x2 in survival you can get bedrock (glitch)
4:52 This song makes me feel like I cam 1v1 the sun and win
ARES WAS THE GOD OF BLOODDUST
Mythrodak: their armoring contraption doesn’t give pickaxes  Mythrodak: goes into contraption and gets pickaxe
Amazing
This is so well edited! Great!🔥
4:23 the only thing they (the guards and warden) fear is you (MythrodakTV)
JJkay  is Seansven without the panda mask
THE DOOM MUSIC
Ive seen this video 13 times and i still get a kick out of it every time.
Best montage that i ever see i can't stop listen to the blowing section  !!! Great job
Mission Accomplished.
We need movie about this guy
...
AWESOME, VIDEO.
Ares: God of War Mythrodak: God of Escaping SeenSven: God of Prisons
THIS VID IS MY FAV SHEEEESHH 12:47
How is the track called
Next time you escape a prison, one (or more) of that prision's builder's head should be on a pike near pumpkin, they failed pumpkin for the last time
I kept forgetting that he doesn’t have mining fatigue and being like” how did he break that so fast” lol
*WHY DO I HEAR DOOM MUSIC*
whats the music in 0:45
It looks like the Lincoln memorial 🤣
Hes the Houdini of minecraft prisons
Wait how did you get a pickaxe
Just punch the bed instead of clicking it will look the same then they kill u and ur free but still very impressive
Rip that poor prison good thing they mainly used obsidian. Also hope it was a world copy
okay but it's a really beautiful build
How did you do that music mix in the end? It's awesome
I love the explosion
holdup why do you have a netherite pickaxe in 11:01 but you said the guard stations only equip the guards with gapples, tools, and armor... I mean pretty big plothole there
I watched his Pandora’s vault video and now I am hooked
Mythrodak: Guards have no pickaxes.   Also Mythrodak: Pulls out pickaxe from Guard Equip Station.     susy
Why did you try to blow up an obsidian prison?
the end was AWESOME
you are a lagend good trick
This was fucking amazing and cool
This was so satisfying!
Mythrodak: cranks up the doom M U S I C Nobody on earth: Me: oooooooooooooooooooooooo             TIME TO SLAY EVERYONE WITH NO ARMOR AND FIST AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Mythrodak: no, that’s ares’ job.
HOLY FUCKING SHIT THAT END. THIS HAS MORE CINIMATICS THAN THE DREAM SMP ITSELF. GREAT WORK SERIOUSLY OMG
Thats great and all now do all that but with out knowledge of the hole layout
Love the Doom music
how come I just found out about this amazing guy ._. Love your videos!
Woah woah woah you said the guards and warden don’t have pickaxes yet you somehow get one
Did anyone else just replay the end over and over again
check mate
IM A ARIES TOO
Couldn’t the guards just pearl out?
MythodakTV has made the advancement: Cover me with debris. The guards when they see the message in chat: oh shit
The guards could get fullbright by editing the txt file in options Yes it is vanilla
I was literally thinking of him saying that every time he did something smart and he actually said it
This is what I was missing in my life THANK YOU
Ok now escape Pandora’s Vault :)
I didn’t know there was a difference between a guard and a warden?
this is so cool, im subbing.
Would you be able to escape a prison without looking into the design etc. Just you inside the cell without knowing where anything useful is located (except for things from the entering process)
Myth: I dont know how long the obsidian can keep him in there Myth 5 min ago: each obsidian can take about 5 min to punch through Me: whaaaaaaa?
netflix better add this show
The last part is a example of when Doom music kicks in
And what if made a prison not olny in overworld?!
when the doom music kicks in 5:09
It's my birthday in 3 days' time. And I love this video. So, from now on, I will continue watching this person's videos, and watch as many as I possibly can on my birthday.
so awesomeeeeeee
“Checkmate”
I realized his parrot is named after a Japanese prison escape artist(thanks Kento Bento)
this man is too cool for school.
12:47 goosebumps
I'm next
this is a piece of art
You miss used doom music am mad right now never misuse doom music
Dude when he said checkmate it so cool(12:47)
You got a new sub. You deserve it.
YO THE CINEMATICS AND EDITS ARE SO GOOD!!!
THIS IS THE COOLEST INTO EVER!!♡♡
The “checkmate” and “who's next” is just beautiful
when the  doom music kicks in
The guy who made the prison : 🗿
Its shame for the police lol
I love the part when he says *'CHECKMATE'*
10:32 how did he get the pickaxes
Welp
12:46 There not playing chest but that was an awsome ending good job.
The next prison should be called TYPHON'S VAULT!
Your insaneeee!
Master of escaping :)
Wasn't ares weaker than hades
What type of doom music was that
You said your laptop was trash but eh you seem fine
The only thing they cant imprison is Mythrodak.
Your videos are absolutely STELLAR!!! This is so awesome!!!
You didn't had any pickaxe and you didn't get it from your enderchest. How did you get it then?
you are amazing
How did h get a netherite pick
Checkmate.
You defiantly got a sub
This was sick happy b-day sorry I'm late
Mythrodak is inspired by shiratori (japan prison escaper artist has escaped 4 prison irl)
I just cant when it zooms into your face with the doom music and your getting ready to break out with a key chain and a carrot
I will make a Prison you don't want to escape.
orrrr rhtye could build a lag machine, with minecarts tnt and autocliker, and put the prison in the nether and lag everyone so their gaming pcs cant handle it and the end goes boom, then you delete the end file and they cant rejoin unless you personally go to the end
Queustion:where did you get the picaxe
The last part is like im watching a action may
Welp more human rights here then the coldest prison
Oh and hi
Thanks mrthordack
Mythrodak after blowing up the guards  "These are suppose to fight back but they didn't for me"  ~Mythrodak from a different video of his
When you're so good you have to cheat to make it harder
Mythrodak should make a podcast talking about random stuff cause wow listen to that voice
u got a pick after saying that the gurds dosent get a pick and u took it out of they kit
How did you get that netherite pickaxe at 10:26?
12:24 when the doom music kicks in
Good music choice.
like that ending was fire
2:22 the text says, I'm saving them. With plumpkin's face. We didn't notice it all along. Only if we knew.
This son of a bitch is waaay too good, they should just stop cause they have no chance
That was Badass!  Reminds me of some equalizer type stuff.
I have yet found no words to describe how awesome this is 😃
3:35 to the spawnpoint is to funny for me
Myth: OP Subtitles: *opie*
Mytrodak try to escape bankers vault it’s inescapable
Mining fatigue and guards looking is actually impossible
Next prison Zeus Vault and it's just a massive cloud
very well put together
4:53 What is this music cause it's epic
What if you just used the glitch To remove bedrock on a 100 Block radius and you just Will be on a floating Block with nothing
What is your iq 150?
Plz tell me what that music was
Favorite part was when he said checkmate
The beginning I want more lore on that bird
i dig the doom music
God. This video had The. Best. Lines. Ever.  (  :3)
0:35 I don’t think I wanna see him big happy
It’s so easy rodak needed to help them
Epiccccc
You make quality video
Why in the gias vault escape video make mythrodack the bad guy?
Everybody gangsta until we run out of gods to name the prisons
I can learn a ton from this guy
The lore tho
AH YES! Explosions are always epic!
Its all fun and games until Doom theme kicks in
why is the ending so epic
12:48
12:48…WTF
I'm just watching a movie
that ending was sick bro
i still wana see you escape these prisons with guards
You actually escaped only because the creators of the prison were lazy and didn't put the guardians so they just put the command block. Now make a way out without destroying the command blocks or put the guardians there.
Everybody gangsta until Doom's music kick in.
This is the last we see of the bird :(
2:18, did he just say.... ?????
End Music: Doom (2016) - BFG Division
It isn’t a war without the doom music
This guy has a great way to make this peaceful game intense as fuck. Keep up the good work!!!
This boi big brain
How do u think of ways to escape prisons
got chills
i  hawe sub
Word of the Century :  "CHECKMATE"
Wanna speedrun prison escape ? Here you go  3 , 2 , 1 ,  4:33

So your telling me that that's a 5 minute introduction?
This guy: * lots of explaining *  "THE" guy: :pokerface: "/gamemode creative".
Checkmate.
THE DOOM MUSIC THO
this was was badass  also nice oneliner at the end
the beat dropped harder than a stepdads belt
Yoo this is so cool! I love how you're making these more and more cinematic, and now we have a voice to our villain! 2:30 Also I guess the administered sedative persists through death? :P
0:35 That smile is the most cursed thing.
Where did you get the puckaxe come from
4:54 oh no, do I hear.... DOOM music, WERE ALL GOONNA DIE RUNNN
people now are naming prisons bankers vault, or vault vault, guess we ran out of roman gods name's
The only thing they fear is mythrodak
that's the deadliest prison in Minecraft and you are the deadliest prison destroyer in minecraft
Bruh ur escaping prisons like you built them. How do you know where are pieces of redstone, pistons etc.
how to create a impossible prison step one: just build a freaking bedrock prison
Nice the start has a good story
Maaaaan the Doom Musik realy spices things up
I love you don’t have to sub i just sud for that 👍🏻
This is epic I'm subbing
Obsidian on this Minecraft: breaks in 5 minutes with fist Obsidian on my XBOX: takes forever with an Iron Pick cause we tried to speedrun and too lazy to get diamonds
5:10  When the DOOM music kicks in
0:15 that's what she said    And also happy late birthday mythrodak
My god this would make a good pilot episode for an amine :0
wow! that very hig level edeting!
*me still wondering wtf this dude did to be constantly sent to prisons*
Bruhhhh this whole thing looked like a movie
you are such a badass i love it
Best prison escape ever
Why tf this is more intense than dreams minecraft manhunt
Drama
More like "Arse Vault"
Ttttttttttyyyyyyyyyy
dude we legit need you in dream smp
His Videos get better and better
I'm now tempted to try making a prison now, good job.
No one makes use of respawn anchors and a dispenser of flowstone fueling it
Doom fans hear the music, and after about 7 minutes, the get internal decapitation from rocking there heads so hard
jjkay said "*hello mssodak *"
When ares is the God of war
12:47
bravo
Mythrodak. I am currently working on an a vault that is better than any other prison in existence. Better than Gaia’s vault. There is one critical flaw with all of these prisons you have escaped. My vault, Medusa’s vault, is void of it.
That was op bro 😦🔥
The doom music went perfect in the end
This is beyond amazing
Mine is 19th of June
THIS IS SOME DEATH NOTE BULLAHIT I KID YOU NOT 12:46
You need 1 million subscribers
12:35 mind is blown🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
THIS WAS THE MOST BADASS ESCAPE IVE EVER SEEN 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🌋🔥🔥🔥🔥
But he knows that it takes literally 5 seconds to destroy Obsidian without   mining fatigue 3??😅
When the doom music kicks in.
Who knew that a music album came with a free guide on how to escape prison?
Noone: Mithorax You can’t escape it boi  Me: lmao
4:55 where the doom slayer has came
Fun fact even tho probably not gonna be seen: his parrot  Shiratori is named after famous prison escapist Yosie Shiratori who escaped prison 4 times then being let out on parole. you laern somthing new every day :D
ngl this is like the best youtuber ive found xD
Man just broke out like a beast
At the end tho: Checkmate
When the doom music kicks in:
How does he break the piston and get it with his fist? Or am I just dumb
Heh heh heh  The obsidian is nothing  My auto bedrock farm will produce.mythrodak will have no chance of escaping Final judgement(or vaults vault)  It’s not done and was built in bedrock edition
I am amazed at how high-quality this video is.
*breaks one piece of redstone*
Fact that he says checkmate!!
when i hear "check mate" i knew it was gonna be epic and it was
I like your voice Lmao
Kkkk
How are these videos more entertaining then actual tv shows
This "Checkmate" was E P I C
Peepoo
This is to much for my brain
Does anyone notice he breaks blocks so fast
my birthday's the 22nd, Happy birthday dude
i subbed!!!!!
when the only thing they fear is you started, i knew it was epic and intense
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THE ENDING WAS SOOOOOOOOOOOOO HYPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE SERIEUSLY THIS WAS AWESOME  THE MUSIC THE "checkmate" THE EDITING  POGGERS
It's like a movie
nice
The editing in this is amazing
I know a prison better
the music was way too loud but otherwise you did great, nice to see another prison bite the dust
I just love how easily he escaped the prison the first time as a joke, and then went on with the video, PRISON BUILDERS SHOULD BE SCARED OF HIM
Haven't seen a more dramatic explosion in Minecraft since the fall of manberg and the end of terra swoop force
The checkmate then the music and tnt * chefs kiss *
this sounds like ASMR
U need 20 million subscribers
POG MOMENT
*The only thing they fear is you* mythrodak, rip and tear until it is done.
Anybody else gettin god of war vibes from these videos
This man is the definition of escape artist.

I remember when you still had a few thousand subscribers

"check mate."  *epic music starts playing*  That. Was. So. Cool!!
Really awesome edit
Checkmate How I love that line
Bro we want gaia prison part 2
police: you are underarrest mythrodak: ok i have this is easy i have escaped like 50 prisons
The most epic escape yet
oh yeah i got a good prison in survival servers  go to console and op yourself and get a stack of bedrock and make a house out of it as simple as that you get an indestructable box you can put griefers in :D
5:10 the beat dropped so hard i lost my headphones
Everyone: this vid is so cool Some random person in chat: Rip guard PC.
Minecraft has turned to an action movie
checkmate:)
This guy is too smart for me . When he was telling us how to escape with mining fatigue i didn't understand anything
*Inescapable prison exists*   Mythrodak: Why hello there
DOOM
5:20 SUS DOOR SUS DOORAMOGUS REFERENCE INSIDE HAHA SUSSY BAKS GET OUT OF MY BEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD SUS DOOR SUS DOOR SUS DOOR
9:27 the guards can turn on show hitboxes with one of the f3 functions
Love the vid, but where did that pickaxe come from tho (10:20-10:26)
escaping intro is the best
One Cross Wire One Way a Word Pitch Of Potassium Calorid One Heavy Twitch And Kaboom  12:38
You can tell he's serious when the doom music kicks in
12:47 checkmate.
Music very epic
More like most deadliest soundtrack... yikes
No more prizon
was that it?
5:03 11:53 best. moments. ever.
who else has no idea how this works but is hyped anyway
Mythrodak: *exists*. Builders: lets build a (NOT) inescapable prison :D
Hope he didn’t blow up the original. He might have blown up the back up
jjkay03 jjkay03 jjkay03
Bruh what is the name of that music that was playing when he blew up the prison.
Mythrodak: 4:33 Me: 🤯
Where did you get pickaxe from?
That ending was literally amazing holy fucking shit
Why did this feel like a movie
Literally everything this guy says sounds so cool
Checkmate
Are you Michael Scotfield grandson bro????
Y u vanish
That's why it's Ares Vault and not Athena's If someone reed (past form of read?) PJO you know Ares is dumb
The doom music hits different with that epic line
There is a prison called bankers vault and another prison called guardians vault :)
Great narration.
Next video: escaping real prison  Dont take this comment to seriously its just a joke
xy:whats the definition of 200IQ? me:
Thanks for sleeping dude-.-
The speech he gave is a fnaf thing right
THIS IS SO COOL I GOT GOOSEBUMPS! “Checkmate.” AHHHHH IT WAS SOOOOO COOOOLLLL YOU EARNED A NEW SUBSCRIBER!
There are many flaws in the escape, they can turn up their gamma, and see mythrodak clearly, they could just break the glass, and pearl through, and not worry about punching the walls, and the stasis chambers, they can just pearl glitch through.
Bro when is the gaias vault coming??
prisons are made to be broken change my mind
Can you escape vertex's vault?
I challenge you to escape spikel's vault. Reply if you accept the challenge. And HAPPY BRITHDAY!!!
I love your editor
Jerrylum debunked your escape. You might wanna escape it again.
do Ares Vault 2.0
If this man was an SCP he'd be appolyon
W
Splendid choice with music, be it Doom music bc it makes u have 200% more capability at minimum
U can't DEAFETED this god he is... BEYOND!!
The intense music is so good
Ares vault? Wasn’t area trapped in an urn once?
That checkmate is coolest moment in this video.
Can you please do miningblobs pyramid prison
Happy birthday also if you haven’t already did it could you do the prison that dream was being held in?
One of the best minecraft vids I've ever watched no cap
30 seconds in and im already subbing!
I’ve watched all your videos about the vaults I love them 😍
That checkmate line was the best last word ever
Remind me to never make a prison
when the doom music kicks in
My POV: wait his eyes are different sizes
Mythrodock: Push Pig Red Button Number Go Higher Mythrodock = Big Happy
If I had to make a prison for a server, and I was an admin, I would build the entire thing in creative mode, forget decor entirely, make the world spawn a bedrock chamber, disable all of the prisoners privileges besides eating, sleeping, writing, using chests, and using doors, keep visitors seperated from the prisoner by a two iron bar thick wall, several kill checks, no stastis (I play 1.82, the ps3 equal to 1.9) and give the prisoners freedom only to speek with visitors with previous method and other prisoners in a courtyard.
the IQ...
DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
U to smort
“but it *C O U L D*
“Checkmate.”
Hi
ok but when will you escape gaia's vault
Gaia’s Vault OHHH BOYYY
MYTHRODAK WHENS GAIAS VAULT
This guy just destroyed the claims that this prison is inescapable in the first half of the video
Never thought a block game will turn this intensifying
The "CheckMate" gave me goosebumps.
you should escape alcatraz for 1mil subs
what you gonna do, what you gonna do when Gaias vault comes for you
try hades prison
If he made a movie all 7 billion people will watch it
SAVAGE!!!
4:55 when the doom music kicks in 🤟
I’m just wondering what crimes he committed to get locked up in such a high security prison
Are you going to try to escape Gaia’s Vault? Also I’m like a huge fan. How do you think to escape all of the redstone?
Nice doom eternal music
"He's to smart to be left alive!"
If you wanna name a prison then follow this guide         (Insert greek god name) Vault
The doom music just toned up the vibe
Tht was awesome dude!
That checkmate line was bad ass
He turned it into astory
I LOOOOOOOOOOOVEE the doom- soundtracks in the background!!! Pls make another Videos, which has this in the background😍😍 Sub is there!!!!
Now your final challenge is escaping gaia's vault
Your to smort
When the doom soundtrack kicks in
Can you escape Vertex’s vault AND Gaias vault AND Banker’s vault AND Gaurdian’s vault?
This guy deserves at least 1 million subscribers. Best analyzer ever.
That ending tho
This guy can escape a bedrock box
Where did you get the netherite pick it wasn’t in the ender chest and you said it wasn’t in their gear
You are the new dream bro !
13:22 WHAT IS THAT
12:48 8 year old me when I find a village in creative
I found a new vault. Gaia's vault
My fav part is where he says “checkmate”
Myth should make a minecraft prison escape movie
TRY TO ESCAPE GIA'S VAULT PLSS I WANT TO ESCAPE THAT PRISON
This is SCP Containment Breach but you are an SCP
"Theres something I must do..." *Doom music starts playing*
Ha you can't escape Gaia's vault
hey mythrodak, do you know if you could escape a prison with mining fatigue, 20 layers of obsidian, and 20 layers of lava surrounding the obsidian. obviously the prisoner would be in a bed trap that they cannot access in any way. no-one would technically be able to get in or out since fire res only lasts 8 minutes, it would be difficult to make an entrance but would that work?
Everyone gangster till mythrodak plays doom “The only thing they fear is you”
You would have 10 minutes to escape if the guards were trapped because you said it would take five minutes to mine one block of obsidian with bare hands and there’s two blocks of obsidian and we all know that 5+5 is 10 11:2
My brother is making a prison for me and he was saying how inescapable it would be, and I said " I'm not Mythrodak or something."
13:22 bro seen sven where you at😂
12:51 checkmate
Checkmate
You: gets sent to Alcatraz for life Also you: goes to visitor center, “hi mom, I’ll be down for Christmas” Gaurds: here we go again
this is like a movie wtf
My guy for useing doom music
I love this moment when he says "checkmate" and the entire thing blows up.
yo im subscribing for this vid
Damn someone knows how to use replay mod 👀👀
This guy is the Houdini of Minecraft.
Happy birthday 😁😁
0:36 look he is smiling:D
i cant wait to see what you planned for that prision at the end. i saw the vid of who made it and he challanged u witch is pretty rare.....can you do it?
This video was the best, yet!
4:52 perfect music (The only thing they fear is you - mick gorden)
I like you because you do not  froce people to sub
13:15 MORTAL KOMBAT REFERENCE
i love how the music intesifies with the difficulty of the prision
let's make mythrodak challenge 2b2t's anti new players defense measures as to make sure whether the legend could overcome such a monumental task. AND IF HE COULD ACCOMPLISHED THAT THAN HE WOULD PUT 2B2T VETERANS TO SHAME!!!!
Try do kill the ender dragon on 21w13a
6:47 Why was there two pieces of wood there?
It gets better every time
Your videos are dramatic I like it
11:48 when the DOOM music hits
11:56 BFG division doom eternal/doom 2016
7:05 artic base
4:27 the only thing they fear is you doom eternal
0:49 command and control doom eternal
The mining fatigue one doesnt work since a guard is always watching
5:03 now that’s just epic
What did you do to be a prisoner that minecraft want to prison in every jail
1.7 is probably the hardest prison to escape, because you can now make a building self aware thanks to the new noice sensor, so breaking or placing a block in the cell, the whole prison, goes to lockdown, no need for people, the prison itself becomes the guard.
Can you escape Gaia’s vault?
If he techno and a godbriger has a kid welp yeq
I'm in the process of making the nost inescapable prison. Especially for you. I wish u luck if you try it out :)
Ill sub cause of what you said before saing subscribe
Myth can escape any prison even mine
Next video: escaping a 1 by 2 bedrock room
Next ep be like: escaping a bedrock cube
Gaia is next
doom music pog
Can’t escape guardian vault I see
hey man congrats for 200k
Mythrodak: Who's next?... I asked for the old guards of Alcatraz to open the prison back up and I will be excape it in real life
Mythrodak starting the escape: hmm ok. CUE THE DOOM MUSIC!  Finishes in 1 minute: eh.
This was so bad ass
How does he get a pickaxe in the prison, as he said the guard equip station does not give one and he does not have one in his e-chest. lol
Me: builds bedrock cube with no door or windows Also Me: Amateurs.
that was the coolest ending i ever seen
ayo what song is that at 10:43 from the doom sound track
Why does the prison look like a bank I hope I'm not the only one that noticed that
The Best Entertainment
What did he do to get into these prisons o.o (other than escaping from them)
Maybe escape Guardian's Vault next?
nobody:  Mythrodak:so u hit big red button, number goes up and I big happy    me: *laughs while hitting big red button*
I love the use of doom eternal music. Brilliant.
I WANT A NEW PRISON ESCAPE VID NOW
U said the guards didn't have a pick axe, yet you have one and you got it from the equipment station, you couldn't of gotten it from the ender chest since it wasn't there when you opened it and it was full with over stuff
GAIA'S VAULT GAIA'S VAULT GAIA'S VAULT GAIA'S VAULT
Dude this guy is a legend
Big boi go boom boom
nice
how did he get a pickaxe. if the guards not had it, an mythrodak had no pickaxe in is enderchest.
Mythrodak you are the mastermind of escaping prisons
Swear to god this guy can escape any prison like -0 degree eh ez 200+ degree eh didnt break a sweat ah yes I’m in the sky lemme just pull out my parachute and become god real quick
has stacks of tnt and then take more tnt for some reason I mean you don't need more than 4 stacks of tnt to escape right.
Where did you get that neterite pickaxe not from equip station and not from ender chest so you must have used command blocks not like it Helped you escape
the part when you said checkmate is so cool
I love how he escaped in 2 sec using the bed at first
Espace tartar's valt first it is possible to espace alone and people say that it is better than gagi's valt so it will be like a practice.
12:46  Check mate  Wow nice line
Do gaia vault pls
the timing and cuts were amazing.
Yo man how did you get the 2nd piece of wood it was 2 blocks away just wondering how also keep up the great escapes man
Plot twist: all the guards and the warden had pearls in their hotbar to escape the trapped stasis chambers.
You better hope they made a copy or backup world before you dest royed it
Bedrock players: (laughs in bedrock farm)
you can only trap him if you can break bedrock
Try escaping Gaia’s vault-  Good luck
Still waiting for Gaia’s vault? When will it happen ur like my fav utoober ever
best uno card i saw
This is probably the coolest MC vid I have ever seen
Mythrodak is the most badass minecraft youtuber
Is jjkay03 Italian?
5:03 AMAZING
So cool that you need to die like 5 times   to escape a prison  ... it's minecraft logic I think
"guards dont have pickaxe only armor and weapons" *gets guard Equipment from dispenser and get pickaxe* Bruhhhhh
sheeeeeeesh
This guy is awesome. Can't wait to see the vid where he escapes a bedrock box.
wha why  2 weeks ago i didnt get notified to this video dude
Happy bday! 🎁
Me pushes him in a 2 block high bedrock contraption
the editing damn
This guy thinks he is so epic but he isn't he 8s doodoo
The doom soundtrack makes it even better
6:45 I wonder what stupid guard wouldn't have a pickaxe on him.
How did you get a pickaxe? Xd
Damn this man won’t give up
"Checkmate." - Mythrodak 2021
Feels like lupin all over again but in minecraft
Seeing the last part made me scream of exiyment
JUST ESCAPE GAIS VAULT
This man... this man is inevitable...
i love how you used the Doom Eternal music for this
Can you try to escape Gaia’s vault
honestly I dont get why people build impressive looking exteriors for their prison, i get it looks fancy but then you have to try and utilize all the space you make, why not build it all undergound, put the cell at the bottom of the world so you have bedrock as a natural barrier as well.
Hey guys I’m about to watch all this mans escaping videos
12:38 CHECKMATE
How's escaping gaia's vault rage can't escape ?
when will he upload excaping gias vault
mythrodak, you are singlehandedly the most *Badass* person I have ever seen.
The high-pitched plow genotypically wink because clarinet incidentally escape times a stale zebra. billowy, embarrassed exhaust
Whos next you say  My little brother is saying take bedrock and cover him in... use /clear @a  and tp him in the bedrock cage 😅
Bro ask mumbo jumbo to do the red stone stuff sven to desin the prison base and some pro builder to do all the stuff
Hey to trap this guy its to go to bedrock find a perfect 3x3 box with and two block opening and cover the 2 block hole with obsidian and keep a close eye on him so if he brings any stuff its impossible to escape
JIGSAW!!
when the doom sountrack hits
the doom music tho
"Sam Make  The most secured prison" dream Said  Mythdorak Be like this IS lame i Haven escaped like 20times harder prison
How did you get it?
At 10:17 you have no pickaxe
0:35
Try escaping a prison made in Minecraft bedrock edition
did i just heard doom eternal soundtrack smmmmfhhh
Call mumbo jumbo and he will make the Olympics prison that I think you can't go out
10:26 got a pickaxe out of nowhere
This man escaped the prison, thought it was too easy, went back, made it harder, and STILL got out.  I'm pretty sure we're dealing with an elder god.
Have you escaped Gaurdians vault?
mythrodak be like: ah yes time to escape the poorly made gaia's vault... another vault you must be kidding me
Mythrodaktv check out thubb's prison it is called guardions vault

I have a challenge for you.. Do THIS prison, but you can’t die once. If you die, you lose it all. And you fail. But if you escape without dying once, you win.
If you want to survive war you got to be war - Rambo

He’s vary smart
You are a GENİOUS
Next up Gaia's Vault
I like this guy with say at ending CHECKMATE
there is v 2.0
This video is cinematic as hell
I absolutely love the editing in this video.
Bruh just place under the end portal
I geuss they couldn't escape Gaiga's Vault
Hello @MythrodakTV , do you also escape prisons on Minecraft Bedrock? I would like building one for you, so pls react if you want to escape it! Ps. You won't escape it 😉
bro the only reason u escape is cause u have no life and u spend your time playing mc
he should of said and if you broke out of your stasis chambers may ares have mercy on your soul
Try out Guardian's vault, by Thubb. His video on it says you can't escape.
what dup step u using
You are my favorite channel
Also I just realized the pick came out of nowhere it just appeared in his inventory
If the guards don’t have pickaxes then how did you get one from the netherite dispencer
Hey what about Gaias Vault? Are you working on your escape from it or is it simply impossible for you?
Try to yous giase vault it was built by sveen and is much bigger and better
Your vids are SICK
this is the definition of high IQ
if there is mining fat then the video would be boring, see all you need to do is: djsbribeidjebdoebdodrigjrpejwpqjfoeboshfiwbeofhrbejsj, EASY
Imagine getting pinned by mythrodak.
This dude is insane
gias vault is next plz
my man is gonna be escaping freaking Tartarus next😂
The dislikes are the people who didn't escape the prison from explanations from him...
Everyone: No one can escape. MyrhrodakTV: Hold my beer.
these are so badass
Can someone tell me when he got the netherite pickaxe cos you don't get from the equip stations and the was none in his enderchest
Mythrodak: if it's war they want its war they get  doom music kicks in
props to mythrodak, his parrot's name is Shiratori. If you don't know, Yoshie Shiratori is the name of the so called 'prison escape magician' escaping abashiri prison and many more.
I think the best thing about this escape was TNT montage
Nuce vid
Now do gaia's vault
The doom Music
My first time watching this channel first i wasnt intrested, but the cutscene hit in the head dope music  caught my eye well done bruv
I've already built the most strong inescapable prison. You Seriouslyy can't escape it lol
I love how he doesn’t want to ask you to sub but he knows he has to so he gets it out of the way as soon as possible
This is why you don’t use a Redstone ore. just use  the block man
Cue random music now
next prison break is gonna be in real life
Its like scripted which makes it boring
A free Netflix show
The editing is mouah 🤌 chefs kiss
Ah, the doom background music
This is some quality content here:)
The edit is sick
Does anyone know the editing software Mythrodak uses?
I can see this guy becoming a part of the dream team
Me who has chunk bans around my house
This man deserves more subs!!!!
(CHECKMATE)
cool but can you make a tutorial to how to escape a real life prison?
this guys: spending months on building a prison mythrodak: *escapes in a few seconds* (4:32)
what if someone makes a bedrock prison      checkmate
wonder if i finally found dream....his face is just like yours and your brain is as big as his
Sickest edit
Hoooooooooooooly shiiiiiiiiiiiit that was sick
Honestly if I could sub 745,000 times over to get him to one mil, I would
The doom music makes it so fucking epic
How he get a pick? 10:33
Gaias vault is next
12:47 the most satisfying word ever
I love how he manage to trap his own gardian
You you know what's about to be serious when they Doom music kicks in
You should have the guards actually try to stop you one of these times and see if you can escape
I can't wait for him to do Gaias vault
We respec da doom music tho
That last part “who’s next” bro that gave meh da chills
The doom music completes it-
now do Gaia's vault noob
Guardian’s Vault?
Happy Birthday
can u escape to a bedrock ?
Because it make happy I subscib
Do Gaia’s vault
this is the best escape so far
when doom music kicks in
Doom theme!!!
Been here since 35k And realized I wasnt subbed and immediately pressed that big @$$ red button
Omg the part where TNT explodes man that is so epic great content :)
I hit big red button
5min intro
If you want a challenge? I will make one for you 😈
Bro you are the best Minecraft creator ever I love ur voice u sounded sooo cool when u said, checkmate
try the prison made by thubb
Please, less special effects next time. It's just a minecraft video, not a superior story lore
This guy is such a god
You said they don’t get pic’s from the armor equipment dispensers
I swear Mythrodak is based on Escape Plan (the movie)
5:25 ALL THEY FEAR IS YOU.        *doom intencifies*
A youtuber Kenadian made a supposed inescapeable prison for origins, I think it would be really cool if you could make a video on it
He simply creates an action movie
this man is too smart the prison is like a joke to him
bedrock
There was a cut where he got an pickaxe I'm wondering how he got that
Mythrodak should make his own prison/vault so he couldn’t escape it then it would be truly inescapable
How u doing this?
god i love the end
The production quality on this is insane. First time viewer here, immediate sub!
You should try to escape the Kingstone and Gaia's Vault!!!
If he said that the guards didn't have pickaxes, how did he get an enchanted netherite pickaxe from the guard rooms
Escape Guardians vault pls
loved the "checkmate...." !!! That word has never sounded that badass
if Alcatraz was still a prison i would like to see you escape it
I loved when he said checkmait
Happy birthday Mythrodak (Sorry if I spelled it wrong)
This man has like 5 quintillion IQ to think of this amazing plan.
Mythrodak's channel has become Nanbaka
They're gonna run out of greek/roman gods soon  Can't wait for the final boss of Vaults, Zeus' Vault
Escape Gaia prison
Mythrodak: gives best intro Me: :0
Mythrodax is feared by the prison Community if your prison can’t hold him it can’t hold anyone
I recognized Micks work immediately
epic
This person has MASTERED the art of editing and script writing.  Edit: I have changed this comment to person instead of man. But to all of you people criticizing me for not writing down the correct pronoun, this was 10 months before it was publicly put out that he doesn't go by the male gender anymore. I do find slightly annoying that people are slightly suggesting my naivety (that doesn't really exist) while being naive themselves commenting on my own comment. Seriously, the hypocrisy is annoying. Oh, and Mythrodak, sorry for calling you a guy and assuming your gender
Broo you videos are almost like movies
Is it just me or is it like this is a horror movie where these people capture like a little girl that has telekinesis and they under estimate her and she like kills them all
The quality of this video legit gave me goosebumps.
“If it’s war they want, it’s war they’ll get”-Mythodak
Bro you said guards don't have tools so how did you get a netherite enchanted pickaxe
cheater 10:17 no pickaxe 10:25 he had a pickaxe CHEATER he said the guards diden,t have any pickaxes and he diden,t have a pickaxe in hes Echest he is a chetaer!
When the doom music kicks in This guy will evolve into its Super duper ultra mega pro max 5G lifeform
This prison isnt the easiest to escape, but if you escape, you're op af and the guards arent (if you do the TNT)
doom music in escaping in ares vault noice :D
u did not do thath right evryone have pickaxe so they will cantch u before u left how did u get pickaxe?
The entry process creeped me out
Me making a bedrock box: Y e s.

YOU ARE ARE INSANE GENIUS
I love rip and tear
It's so cool to see how big this channel has gotta good job man you deserve it
When the DOOM Music kicks in:

I made my one prison i think dat you can't escape my prison chronos vault no redstone its impossible
Gaias valut left 😃
The guard Set gives armour gapples and weapons...  No One: Technoblade: hold my pickaxe
👀 your a monster
i made a prison that looked really simple but it’s really hard to escape its made out of oak wood and bedrock :-)
Wouldn't anyone trying to imprison you have you screen share and show you have nothing?
Ive got a better way to escape                           Leave the game lol
Checkmate 	-mythrodak
happy very late birthday! awesome video as always
10:10   Wait... Where did Mythrodak get the Pickaxe? He said the equip stations don't give them and he never took one out of his enderchest...   SuS
This vid is the definition of war
I love how he said that we did not need to sub. Because of this I subscribed
You are so cool Mythrodak. I love it.
this dude is more likely to survive a zombie apocalypse             No prison are a match for him

Everyone gangsta till we run out of mythological figures to name prisons after.
Nice outro sounded like it was from doom
Gaia's vault vs mythrodak This is gonna be interesting.
DIS SHIT BE HYPE
“Checkmate” is epic
The most dramatic minecraft video ever!
Dude this actually fun not boring
Why do absolutely all wardens from prisons have some kind of accent? It just happens, all the time.
He made a new prison called the kingstone. I honestly think that you can't escape it
Why do absolutely all wardens from prisons have some kind of accent? It just happens, all the time.
if you see this man and the doom music starts and he has all netherite armour you need to get the fuck out of there
I dare you to escape gaias vault made by seensteeven
Jerrlum fail your escape by making your explaining how to stop you by some tactics your escape will feel
i might as well make a bedrock box and make it really good. see if he can escape it with actual security measures.
u deserve a sub, ur videos are soooooo goood
CHECKMATE
the quality in his videos is so damn good....
Escape Gaia vault
Most of this plan can be countered by the guards having a pickaxe, sure it may not be dispensed to them but they'd definitely have one on them or at the very least in an e-chest
Pandora’s vault of the dream smp: *imbisils+*
Someone put mythrodak in prison   Mythrodak: Takes out Uno reverse card
Ares vault guards gangsta till mythrodakTV speedrunning escaping ares vault with doom music
Jesus
Houdini: Minecraft edition
My question is why does he keep on getting sent to prison
What about making a prison in the end where The prisoner is trapped in the end with no exits because the endear dragon is still alive
Simple. Log out
jjkay03: Try getting out of this prison MythrodakTV Mythrodak: No... You try and get out if this prison *activates ender pearl stasis*
Il make a jail let's see if u can escape it reply to me if ur up for it
This was just a master piece well done
so try to scape of gaia's vault
*SPOILER*      Not only did he escape he even destroyed the prison with they're own TNT he took disrespect to a new level
What is the cosmetic aspect for this prison…it ain’t a war god themed prison, it’s a goddamn temple xD
12:41 - 13:01 NOICE
4:57 hehe doom music
A true cinematic masterpiece lol
Mythrodak in prison: 🤔*Thinking* Gaurds: Theres no way he escapes this one!! Mythrodak: Checkmate.
Maybe you should escape seen steve's prision
All of the last prisons can not build in the survival so everything prison builders should do is to just build a prison with bedrock and also anyone who build this ur so stupid u spent like thousands of obsidion blocks and red stone u couldnt just make a red stone block instead of that?
The Doom music really set the mood
Don't get me wrong, but this is the greatest video on the internet
ok i dont want to be that guy but if he had mining fatigue the guards would notice much earlier, so the only flaw with the prison is actually the lack of elder guardians. otherwise, this tactic wouldn't work
Perfect music for the ending
That checkmate thought
Zeus is like: nah bitch I’m good
I just made a concept of a unescapeable prison      so the concept is this:  step 1: getting to the end step 2: destroying entire main island (when I say entire I mean obsidian and endstone) step 3: use every obsidian block to make a obsydian box trap step 4: get elder guardians into the end step 5: build atleast 50 traps step 6: block the exit portal step 7: make a ender pearl stasis chamber for each guard step 8: rebuild stronghold with obsidian step 9: give every guard netherite armor, sword, tools and crossbow step 10: make sure that everything is impossible to escape step 11: get blazes in the end step 12: make a perfect plan step 13: make trap with blazes step 14: make sure that everything works step 15 (last step): get ready   that is basically the perfect prison (this needs 10+ guards and the stronghold 2+ guards)
Literally they are making them so big and too complicated. Just put a repeating pistons over the bed and elder guardian down and the cell is an obsidian room with a simple piston door with netherite blocks and the bed is high so when he respawns the pistons will push him down and he will fall in the water thats in the cell. For decoration put paintings, item frames and torches. The prisoner cant use them as blocks to build up. Try to get out of this. A lot harder than escaping ares vault. Also add 2 iron doors that you can open with levers in guards room so someone can visit him. When you open the netherite block door and the prisoner goes to the first iron door there is a dispenser that has instant damage 2 pots or arrows i prefer arrows so you can put more. The dispenser is so high up, the prisoner cant reach it so the guard will close the door when the visitor is in the cell and then if the prisoner is in the cell it is good, but if he is near the iron door the guard will shoot arrows from the dispenser until the prisoner is dead and back in his cell. Pretty much inescapable right? Btw there are 2 layers of obsidian wall and mining fatigue 3 because of the elder guardian. I made this prison on my world.
@MythrodakTV Are you fine with going onto bedrock for a prision
happy birthday even if its late. but bro SOOOO COOL EDIT AT 11:48
Okay super impressive and stuff, but you kinda said that they don't get a pickaxe so they can't mine through the walls, but then you get a pick to escape? Idk sorry its not that important
Myth your birthday gift is 3 new subs :D
The ending omg I can’t wait but it does really seem impossible but I hope you can do it
i feel like I’m watching a movie omg
posiden, hades, titans, Ares whats next zeuz's vault??
YO THE ENDING WAS SICK DUDE!!!
I mean like... there going to run out of roman gods to name the prison
Techno blade would be proud
why there is a redstone line in every single prison next to the cell lmao?
This has no reason to be this epic, but I swear your cinematic shots are better than some professional filmmaking studios.
MAN WENT HAM WITH IT SHEEESH
Now that I think about it the fbi is probay near to contain mythrodak
Gaia’s vault must’ve broken him
escape satans arch
How can someone be smart like you. Please teach me teacher.
This is too good wow
Dooooooom!
Way to actually contain this lad: Just make a large obsidian block with no concievable exit...also known as no exit whatsoever
Ah the doom music, gotta love it
I guess the next one is Gaia’s Vault, I have no idea what he is going to do to escape that monstrosity
Petition for mythrodak to join the dream smp
3:50 bla bla bla nonsense
3:44 lol
I love the Checkmate at the end
What crime did you do to go to prison
Someone needs to put this guy in a real prison to see what he does
Why  Why Why are u soo intelligent tell me
Great use of the only thing they fear is you. The second I heard the main riff I liked and subbed
didnt you say hat the gaurds dont get picks in their stations? you were mining blackstone here with a netherite pick 10:59
Mythrodak If I built a prison which will be inescapable but it will be in mcpe..would you try to escape from it..?
2:23  I'M SAVING THEM
oh my fucking god  destroy the gaia's vault plz
Why in the world are prison names god names dude leave them alone
When the doom music kicks in..
Mythrodak: Who's next?   Me: yeah imma head out  Me also secretly: building a prison that 9000x9000
When the doom track kicks in  Mythrodak: CHECHMATE👌
Dude you’re always one step ahead of everyone
I would like for everyone to know that I worship this man as a god now
Holy crap this is so dramatic
Hmmm how he got that netherite pick?
nice bird name reference
Didn't he say they don't have picks but when he went the to equipment for GAURDS he got a pick s u s
You disserve so many more subscribers!! you videos are amazing!
Why not try to break out of ares vault 2.0?????
I think even the FBI is scared of him
avengers endgame? pfft no  this is better
Next time try breaking in
Next video: escaping the police.
i hope @MythrodakTV is big happy
lots of 'hardest to escape' videos.
You knew more about the prison than should have been known by anyone other than the warden but still good job
Next: Escaping Scp Site-19 with only a toothbrush and a fork
YOU HAVE NOT ECAPED GARDIANS VAULT!
The funny thing is that most of the tnt in the guard areas probably didnt blow much stuff up
The tame nigeria postauricularly overflow because cheek dimensionally bless against a low shoulder. well-off, judicious theory
Brooooo great vid... You are so so underrated, you deserve 5 mil subs!
"BFG division goes with almost every game" - someone smarter than me
"Only five minutes"
As soon as he somehow breaks out of Gaia's Vault I'm literally going to spend weeks trying my damned hardest to make something better.
the next vault should be Mythrodak’s Vault
When the doom music kicks in
Not only escaped it but destroyed it to
5:18 I love the song choice
I bet if he will be in the most secure prison in the real life world he will exit in 2 minutes
Next vid:   I’m going to a real prison
rip editors time
Pls give me a shout out in ur next video, I'm trying to start my own channel, I rlly love ur videos great job
you told us that the guards didn't get pickaxes but you got one when you got the tools.
Bro i dont know why u just put someone with 5 layers of obi and thats it just put someone to be there at all times
i love the doom music intro it's so good
Escape Gaia's vault
This is sick
I’m making a prison and I added elder guardians but it gives you money and fatigue every three minutes so it won’t work too well but I will add a command block to add it every two minutes
if the gaurds dont have picks why do you have one
Mythrodak: *“serious”* Also mythrodak: by the way theres a command block here BECAUSE THEY WHERE LAZY TO PUT ELDER GUARDIANS!
I subscribed I love when YoutubersDo that quirky little thing where they do their own little subscriber thing instead of that stupid only 0% of my Viewers are actually subscribed but you did big happy :D

Blowing up the prison when the doom music kickes in
Happy birthday Mythrodak! (Even tho im late)
Just put him in a box of 100 layers of obsidian and netherite blocks covered in lava I think that is way more effective

13:12 bye bye gaia
Genius absolutely genius
I love how the music goes all amped up when the TNT exploded and you say 'chackmate' like an experienced Chess player
This man is a genius

Dude, Someone made a new prison called vertex vault, pls escape it!
Everybody gangsta til the guards use /tp

It was like watching a movie
Are there some kind of rules for making inescapable prisons? Like having a spesific amount of death traps? Size of the cell?
.....
every prison maker in existence just deleted their maps-
Epic yt channel bro  Amazing this makes me feel like im watching a movie
Looks like mr. Robot
The prison gaurds:      Why can I hear boss music..?
The disgusting ex-husband individually command because tile similarly plug among a jagged semicolon. faded, sulky ravioli
You know everything about the prison so that sucks
But the thing is your not supposed to know what the prison looks like
Im new to your channel and this is Awesome im watching more!

He gave me chills when he said whos next
escape my prison and its 200x200 bedrock box ;)
hey mythrodak i have a video idea you team up with seensven and the deaf creeper to build a vault and since you can break out of any vault you make a vault and test it and tell them how you got out or could get out and they fix and you will help making the true INESCAPABLE VAULT so other people can try to break out of it      LIKE IF YOU THINK HE SHOULD DO IT.
Please do rays works’s pleeeeeeeease do it
Editing is so good
Man the last part where he says check mate that's cool
Happy vday I just started watching you videos of the escapes and good job your so good at these you have to teacher me someday

Shoutout to the editor
This is really well made! I love the prison escape format and I hope you'll do more of it in the future.
2:18 did he say fucked?
SAVAGE. *JUST FUCKING SAVAGE*
Why does the god of war have some kind of heavenly vault? They are an evil god shouldn’t they have some kind of evil looking vault like hades’ vault
This guy gets arrested in real life  MythrodakTv: Well time to escape
Minecraft youtuber: make inescapable prison MythrodakTV: This is a job for me
This video is great!
When the Doom music kicks in…
Wait so u actually made Aries vault I thought I was joking when I said that.
"ares was the god of war... and if it's a war they want, then it's a war they'll get." WHEN I TELL YOU I STARTED SCREAMING AT THIS PART O M G

Checkmate indeed
At the start, i was thinking, hmmm some doom eternal ost would be fitting, then, DO I HEAR BOSS MUSIC
love the doom music
Mythrodak is wanted for being the best prison escapist, no crimes, just good at escaping.
Dammmmm
The production quality on this is INSANE
The DOOM music makes this so much better. Which DOOM game was this song from? Or was it the dlc?  Edit: nvm I just realized that it’s from DOOM: ETERNAL
THIS IS THE GREATEST MC VIDEO TO EXIST
There's a glitch where you can move bedrock just use that
checkmate
not dramatic at all im being sarcastic, but its dramatic in a good way (:
How Are we able to know the schematics of the prisonif a command block isn't available in survival then shouldn't spectator not be available you should try to break one out of a prison without going in spectator to observe the prison
The dusty popcorn objectively scrape because pet ultrasonically x-ray underneath a warm cd. gleaming, domineering element
Bro the edditing
Bruuuh i want the gaia's vault escape videooo

He ecaped in less than five minutes with mining fatique without spawnpoint. Wow
Hello Mythrodak I have created a prison although idk how to make it a map. can you help ive spent over 5 weeks building and desighning could you make a video about it?
I absolutely love that u use the doom eternal music
u make some of the best videos I will sub
Checkmate :O that's the best catch-phrase in the world
*learning about Harry Houdini in school* me= "he's nothing compared to Mythrodak."
God tier editing 😁
Checkmate…
Bruh, the intro was like doom 2016
MEGA MIND THAT YOU?!
The Checkmate Is Always The Best Part *Change My Mind*
But how did he get a pickaxe
What kind of pc do you have??! Shaders + lots of tnt, and your computer didn’t explode with the vault?! How?!
There is no glitch to teleport
That ending was pretty poggers my guy
How did you get a pik you said their guard equipment stations don’t have a pikaxe so they would just mine the blocks and kill you no hate intended
Give a shot to vertex's vault by frront

hey mythrodak, my server is building a giant prison, and when it is done, I want you to test it just to see how good of a job, I dare you to try to crack the Vault of Eos.
I absolutely love how it kind of sounds like a story. At the end when I saw that the house was in flames, I was like, "OH NO! NOT THE PARROT!!!!" My jaw dropped faster than light. And then the parrot flew down and I was like, "Oh my gosh thank goodness..."
Since the guards are watching I'll just wave at them for a week then start escaping
This video is so good it’s basically an action movie
Brutal !!!!!
J e f f o r y

Mythrodak has finally been beaten
"I have placed TNT in every room"  The walls are obsidian and the floor is water in most rooms lol

Bro bedrock vault and this dude would break out like sreusly
ok I’m making a prison called no and it’s an bedrock box
This is litterally a movie! I watched it like 10 times!
Who's next... 2 by 2 bedrock box
You my sir have earned a sub beacause of your infinite² iq

You should try to break into guardians vault
Mythrodak literally went ok your prison sucks I’m making it impossible just for a challenge
Yooooooooooooooooooo
you said the guards got no tools and i saw no pickaxe in your ender chest, how did you get the one you used while escaping?
This guy might escape real prison!
he talkin bout all this like hes finna rob romania
Someone make a Zeus’s vault and just put him in a room with lightning rods surrounded by nether it’s blocks with mining fatigue 3 infinitely and make the bed trap like 100 blocks higher than his cell that drop him into a single block of water with all of the walls surrounded by lava and have the usual lava water thing with the walls make it entirely out of nether it’s kill check him 5 times using a hopper Minecraft to collect his stuff instead of a person make the only way in a extremely hard ender pearl jump which once there is someone in there the ender pearl jump is lock nether portal traps only way to get in is someone else letting you in and the guard has a channeling loyalty trident so he throw it at the prisoner when he tries funny business the only opening is where the guard watches you 24/7 there is an alarm also random chamber filled with with cues so when you try to just walk off the edge than you get killed by witches boom impossible prison also make the food be dropped from where he spawn from a dispensing system lol get noobed nobody can escape that also put the warden mob in his cell actually two of them
This dude has a higher iq than anyone to ever live
Doom music

5:07 Your Welcome
Next vid: Escaping Alcatraz irl

During the obi mining at the bottom of the pit, the guards could do  F3+B to see your hitbox to jump down and kill you
NICE! Your videos are like watching a movie, so well done!
You don’t have too say it like that
Bruh how many prisons are there.
So intense for a block game
Why no other prison have bedrock
do aries vault v2.0
your videos and escape are so fcking great
Dude! Just awesome
I suggest, making a cinematic view of you escaping without talking at the end of the video.
0:35 most cursed thing I've seen in ages
I remember seeing your early vids when you weren't as popular, it's really good to see you doing this well!
No one can trap the all and mighty MythrodakTV!
When mumbo joins
The best vault would be at bedrock where there is a two block deep hole
Dude the end was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO COOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Welcome to the World's Most Deadliest Prison      Mythrodak: Interesting....  I 'll take two!
This guy getting arrested     *so I took that personally*
lmao thats so funny I can just imagine ppl be like.. ITS HIM GET HIM! then he just wakes ups to to be in another prison LMAOOO
is it just me or does our pal Mythrodak get more and more aggressive the more times he's captured..?    just a head theory, of course.
How did you get tnt?
Dude just ban the player who broke the rule than constantly keeping him in prisons.
this shit is so cringe
Ohh my god this is better than most of the movies
Waiting for gais vault escape
How about awesomedudes prison
Bro you know it's gunna be good when the doom music hits and it says "if it's a war they want then they will get a war"
Any prison: exists  Mythrodak: Allow me to introduce myself
You know it’s gonna get serious once the doom music kicks in
ME I have a base that give you mining fatigue 3 from elders and lava coating the cell and it is blast proof and when try to break a block it will ope the front right into lava
What’s that song
Easy way to make one of these: no visitors so. O complex system just bred and a bedrock box.
underrated channel
where did you get that pic
Dude.... Brooo. How epic is that doom intro to the prison i mean gosh freakin dang man you KILLED it on this one. Thumbs up for my boy here.

You earned my respect dude
When he said I need to be fast while breaking the red stone ore it cut off to an add and sounded like I need to be fat.
Someone: builds an in inescapeable prison   Mythrodak: Im about to end this man's prisons
How many gods do they have left to name it after.
HOLY SHEESH THIS IS EPIC OMG THE EDITS ASWELL!!
Either you keep the likes at 69k, or you turn it into 69M
12:40 now that my friend is justice
How many gods are in prison building business
He makes this way more exciting and stressful than it actually is
I had to do a report on Ares in school
Mans is just gonna go through the full list of Greek gods as prisons finishing of with zeus' vault
Where the fuck is the parrot
Alt title: escaping the Whitehouse
How high is your iq
The guards: This prison is inescapable.   Mythrodak: This is supposed to be a prison?
not to hate but kinda cringe ngl
You should ty escape guardians vault I think it’s called!
I've never laughed so hard  4:06
Dude when he first got in the prison and was talking to himself.  I had a Mr Robot Vibe
THE COOLEST PART IS ""BLOWING UP THE PRISON" OH MY GOD HASDUDASUGVBSUAYHYDHAA
Four minutes in the video and he already escaped the prison
yes.
the checkmate bro needs to star in a minecraft action film
The ending is really cool I love it
posidens valt
how to escape Ares vault step one: activate DOOM music  step two: fuck around a but while playing DOOM music and you escape (because DOOM)
doom music fit perfectly
Yooooooooooooo this was a BANGER!!!!!
This guys a bad a$$
this is not funny anymore
Wait how did u get pickaxe?
Happy Birthday Mythrodak! I absolutely love your content! It is just so outstanding how you do all of your planning and escapes! But, I had one question. What is the name of your pet parrot?
How did he get a netherite pikaxe? Can someone explain?
Try to escape guardians vault
in prisons mythrodak always comes firt
oh no not the 100000000iq redstone
you know it bouta go god mode when you hear doom music
/setspawn Mythrodak 0 -500 0 now escape it
How did you get the netherite pick, u said that the room doesn't have a pick ready
Why was that so bad ass jesus
the doom music fits so well
In 10:14 there is netherite armor wearing thing and that only give sword and armor.there is enderchest too but that have tnt obsidian golden apple flint and steal totem of undying 10:24 and boom magic of mythrodaktv netherack pickaxe show up but is okay i still watch ur vid is great other youtubers that worse than u but i still like them good work u derserve 237k subs.
Just a recommendation you should do this with friends but the vaults are a little bit nerfed so it doesn't take you years to escape. That would be very fun to watch
Try to name a prison he cany escape
How Mythrodak escaped in a nutshell:  "Rip and tear until its done"
YOU DKNT GET ENOUGH CREDIT, THIS IS THE COOLEST EDIT I SWARE, fav mcyt by far, also you neeeed to teach us how u edited this video it’s very inspiring
yo the doom soundtrack sounds sicc
Escape guardians vault
U are a genius
k but... WHEN gaia?
5:03 LoL not until kratos killed him
Damn that outro tho
You're insane! And I like that
dang, not only are the escapes sick, but your editing skills are top notch
an new chalenge;gai s vault
O wow, um I wasn’t expecting this, my friend copied this build and put me in it. This is going to be so useful  Edit: wait he didn’t have mining fatigue. Dang it
Can i send you a prison when I've finished it so you can try to escape
escape vault 36 after giasis vault
If he didn't have a backup that's just strait up mean
😳 13:15
bro this guy can change lives with people escaping prisons in real life
sick vid man. musician the way u said checkmate. epic
most badass minecraft video ive seen
Tnt: peace was never an option Obsidian: tis but a scratch
So if the gaurd gear station gives "Armour gapples & weapons" and there was no pick in the chest where did mans get it.
best prision escape ever this is sick
Holly crap ur savage
Waymin...this prison seems ass since you explained in 3 seconds how to beat it
I think you should make a prisons you would know how to escape
BRO SOMEBODY GET THIS MAN IN THE DREAM SMP RIGHT NOW
prison at 13:22 be lookin' like a prison of gods
I hear doom music
Like the Doom Music
How can this man not get into dream smp
So if there is no mining fatigue (is that how u spell it, idk im bad at english), the guards can just break the Obsidian very easily and just kill u right?
Technoblade: IM THE GOD OF BLOOD AND DEATH AND I SET WITHERS EVERYWHERE AND BLOW THINGS UP  Mythrodak: Challenge accepted
4:52 the moment all of men shit their pants, the music of the devil has arrived.
Quick question for anyone that might know: why is there wood in the bed trap?
It's now a battle between minecraft's most inescapable prison and minecraft's best prison escapee. Who or what will win?
Top 10 one liners before the kill.  _Number one:_  Checkmate.
This is my first time watching you and I love your voice
This is by far the most badass escape yet
Doom music in a minecraft video? Pretty pog not gonna lie.
this is so cringe
Wow
how did he get a pick?
4:52 is when the doom music starts
the point is that in an actual survival version of the prison, they would have had guardians instead, but for the sake of simplicity they just used a command block. disabling the command block is just a cheap cop out imo
The parrot named Shira Tori is a reference to the great Japanese prison break Yoshi shiratori escaped every prison they put him in it's a true moment is history
Love these vids keep it up
WHY ARE ALL THEESE PRISIONS NAMED AFFTER GREEK GODS?
Dream when he sees this vid: ayo man me and my friend got stuck in a room be a Chad and help us pls
*confused yaying*
Can you escape from brazil?
I want the doom music
There's nothing stopping this guy
He's gonna escape the gaias vault next I know it 😂
can you test my prison?
Dam the one he doesn't use items in is the most epic
0:31 made my day
How to capture even mythrodak: use the glitch to get bedrock, destroy the prisoners last spann point, Build the bedrock box and kill him
this series is better than prison break
y'know at that last part i now see why they put you in the prison in the first place.
Here’s Gaia’s vault
Try escaping guardians vault it's impossible
This guy Is just casually escaping prisons
To Mythrodak-im trying to get better at pvp. I wanna practice with you. Give me the word. And I'll tell you my gamertag so i can pvp with u
Wats the song?
You have really good editing
the editing is amazing great video i love these
Did the warden equip station gave you netheright pic?
he's so good at escaping prisons and finding loopholes in them, he could escape from irl prisons
some one is takeing your Contin even with the same tumbnail
HOW DID U GET THE NETHERITE PIC!!????!?!?!?!?!?! U SAID THERE WAS NO PIC IN THE GEAR CHEST
If I was in that prison I would just accept defeat but you my guy just broke the system and said "no prison for me"
DOOM music kicks in
Some real shiz is about to happen
This guy is insane, imagine if he built a prison that was actually inescapable
Ur crazy
1 mil views dang gg
Wow

Ik how to make in escapaple vault... 1. Make a cage in the middle of no where 2. Put powder snow around it for than 100 blocks worth 3. Under the snow put lava 4. Get the prisoner and you cant escape 5. Kill him before he comes in he might have leather boots
when doom music kicks in
that ending was pure legendary
When the doom music kicks in 12:30
I will give you a late birthday present, a sub, like, and ringing the bell. Happy birthday mr escapist.
these intros seem like the start of an great action movie
This is one of the best videos I have ever seen on YouTube!
The opening though-I was zoned out with this in the background and the one thud just startled me back to the video XD
ayoo youve grown bro
It took me 3 days to watch ch the video it's so soothing that I fell assleep
Next upload: Escaping real life prison
If you are so good at detecting flaws in prisons why don't makimg your own unexcapeble prison
2:18 DId mYthRoDaK SaY THe F wORd???
eyyyy yoooo prizon builders what if you made him die on a loop
Who’s next, looks at the other vault. Me wardens vault
lovin the doom music
You gave them an escape route with the “checkmate”
He: Who is next... ?  Gajas vault:Hello There
10:26 he said they dont get an pickaxe then how he have a nethrite efficiency 5 picaxe??????????????????????//
someones been studying greek mythology
CHECKMATE...*MEGA ROCK MUSIC PLAYS WITH COOL EDITS WHILST BASE XPLODES
So from making a prison that can successfully trap dream and keep him in the prison forever, to prisons that try to imprison mythrodak. Wow, that escalated quickly
I have a challenge for you, check my Chanel after a week, this sure would be inescapable.
This man is getting good in prison breaking
Happy birthday but where did you got the pickaxe from
when u realize i was one of the guard totally humiliated
Can I just say using the DOOM OST as the background music was an absolutely masterful choice.
Mans on some Hoodiny shit
Its time for you to use mw 2019 ost
mans going to be uploading daily if any more prisons are made
i just made mythrodaks day and made him big happy.
Happy Birthday
I want him to have a base that doesn’t get found
How to EASILY escape this  Don’t click on the bed 😳
what would you do if they used a redstone block instead
Wow, such escaping.
someone: "this base base is inescabable"  Mythrodak: "I'm sorry, i dont speak wrong"
Happy B-Day
One Million Views!   Congratulations :)
When Doom music plays you know everyone will be fucked up by one dude.
good luck: Citadel 32 (prision)
12:09 beep connection terminated
This is Damn Like A Movie Hahah
gaea's vault  ..................... they r all named after greek mytology
For anyone who wants the "CHECKMATE" 12:47
The question is what crimes are he commiting to get put in these prisons
Debunking this escape method : 1. The guard can get in your place where you will get pushed up using enderpearl glitch 2 The guard can still refill all the redstone block 3 Guard can still kill you outside the respawn point using the potion 4  No, the guard will not come up and try to stop you. They can break glass and pearl 5  The guard can still use redstone torch and piston to get in that tunnel, it takes like 30 seconds and pearl thru 6 Just break the glass and pearl 7 Press F3+B And the guard can see you. there is no way of hiding your hitboxes 7.1 Or you can change your gamma setting to 50 and the guard can see you now 8 You can use a button instead of redstone torch 9 When you take out the entire guard force the guard can just use enderpearl glitch, so this can only give you a few second 10 The guard have a highway for guard only. and the guard can just go thru that and block the portal 11 The guard can just store pickaxe in their enderchest  So you should put a disclaimer : Requires the guard to be dumb or else it won't work
THE DOOM MUSIC
The music is a banger
Petition to add mythrodak to dsmp
just punch through the wall idiot, or just don't enter the prison idiot, also setting world spawn in a prison is immorla
Bruhh this dude taking Mission Impossible to Mission Inescapable.
Although the unrealistic parts. I literally do not care at all. Quality content, love the doom music and the cinematics. Everything in general is perfect!
THIS IS A MASTERPIECE!
I am an ares
These are cool
i feel like ur that one guy in the group that can take one LITTLE detail and turn into something equivalant to blowing up the sun
happy b-lated bday also ok edge king
No need to ask mythrodak....I subbed after watching the video on Pandora's vault.
HOLY SHIT THE EDITING IS AMAZING SUBBED IMMEDIATELY
Idk if it’s just me or did he just spawn in a netherite pickaxe because he didn’t have one in his enderchest and didn’t get one from the armor equipment station (no hate I am just wondering I love his videos)
Whats with people building vaults named after God’s
They can't use commands to make it harder but he can, ok.     HAPPY BDAY
happy bday mythrodak
i love how the more "secure" they are, the lesser of the god it becomes, like Hades and Poseidon vaults, and now we're down to Ares. What we should really be afraid of is the eventual Hypnos vault, Hypnos being the god of sleep
omg your escape vids are so cinematic, your actually epic. Keep escaping! and just want to compliment how good your vid presentation is
Happy birthday and my gift for you is sub and like. Great videos i hope you will make more of these kind of videos
collest end ever noice job
What is with Greek mythology and Minecraft prisons?
Where did you get the netherite pick from?
Next video: Escaping my prison
The end part with the tnt is a danganronpa execution lmao
LEGENDARY
LEGENDARY
What's that Doom like music in the background?
imagine when this guy makes a vault, it will truly be inescapable
When the doom music kicks in
I know that u dont need it but anyways gl ;)
Dude are those netherite blocks?!
when the DOOM music kicks in but it’s much better
where'd he get his pickaxe from?
mojang: hello this is minecraft a game made for kids  this guy: 5:10
bruh i luv how this guy acts so badass all the time lol
5:28 The gate is looking kinda s u s
Mythrodak: Who's next?  Seensven: uh oh...
no prison can stop this boi from escaping ...
All these Videos are great, but big doubt that those escapes would be possible, because who would give you the blessing of analysing the whole prison in spectator mode? But where would be the Quality Content if you couldn't escape these cleverly designed boxes...
I have the same birthday as u lol
Insane video!!
HAPPY B-DAY!!!
Thats gias vault in the end scene
at this point, a prison needs a system where he doesn't die.
Basically when doom music kicks in
Nice 5 minute intro
Everyone gangsta until mumbo jumbo makes zues vault
why is MythrodakTV so Big Brain?
that moment when the gaurds hear the doom music
u spawned a pick in 10:20
DOOM IS ETERNAL!!!
Ho did you get a pickaxe?
Why... Why u use "the only thing theyfear is you"?
who are those 890 people that dliked
so if the guard armor station has no tools then how you get the netherite efficiency 5 pick
Hmm...so the Pandora's vault is not the most dangerous???
Gaurds be like: You are trapped here forever Mythrodak: *lights tnt* No, you are all trapped in here with ME!
Me just happy cuz every prison is a Greek gods name so I can express my true neediness of Greek mythology
You are the smartest minecraft player
"In the official prison maker handbook, it says that command blocks are not allowed, NO COMMAND BLOCKS OR YOU DIE" -Mythrodak 2021
Its pain to see all this hard redstone work to be destroyed but it was super cool
enjoys video. subscribes. mythrodak becomes a grinning eldritch horror. what have i done
What about guardians vault?
Wait how did he get a pickaxe he said the guards don’t have one
i cant resist that smile im subbing
how did you get a pickaxe? there was not a pickaxe in your enderchest and neither does the warden equipment chamber give a pickaxe
lol he escaped in 5 mins but use /spawnpoint ok
“ it is massive “                                                                                   That’s                                        What                                                                                              She                                          Said
I'm proud of you kid!
When did he get a pickaxe!
Can you try to escape Ares vault version 2
It’s the “Who’s next” for me
The kick to doom Music though….😱
if the guards didnt have picaxes how did you get one?
this is like money heist
this video is absolutely beautiful
The doom music fit the video so much
if anyone wants to know, the absolute banger at the end, is BFG division from the doom OST, by Mick Gordon
I am actually making a prison and its pretty hard to escape, i didnt find any way to escape, and i stood in there for 4 hrs, so if u want, i can send it to u  It has no signs Cant break bed Manualy item checking Guard always next to u in in testing zone Torture system And much more....
When the doom music kicks in lol
That was an epic ending and I was waiting for you breaking out of that vault the one with the lime and green spikes !
Best edited video ever omg
YOU ARE SO UNDERRATED
Mythrodak mining blob made a prison called vault 36 it will be hard to escape. Try to escape.
what is song name when tnt blowed up
wat if we make a prisom that keep falling and has mining fatige 3
Goosbumps, literally
The songs I recognized were transistor fist, rip and tear, and BFG DIVISION, all from doom
Well just breakthe bedrock at the bottom of the pit with bedrockbreakers and then you have a Problem so that you fall into the void
Mythrodak: "checkmate "  me  :             " subscribes "    ooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
everythings is hopeless, but the doom music kicks in
can you escape Gaia's vault?
epic as always 👍👍👍
Guardians vault has captured you how will you escape
an bedrock chamber that is walls of bedrocj and a roof of bedrock
You cannot use doom music and make a god of war rephrence as a gamer I won't allow it
"Welcome to Ares Vault, boys."
This boi has a fully made escaping channel
"My god this man is a genius"
I like how you used doom music cuz I love the doom franchise great vid
checkmate he says calmly  (i cant be the only one who replayed that atlewst 10 times)
I love how you make it so dramatic these are quality
Somebody: builds a prison Mythroday=Ok lets grief it and brutally murder the guards
GET SOME GUYS FROM 2b2t AND GRIEF EVERY SINGLE PRISON
There’s one major flaw that no one has thought of yet
Me: How's he gonna escape this one? Mythrodak: "I'm gonna set my spawn point so I have more of a challenge"
Man got full netherite while escaping the prison and destroying the prison in the process
MythrodakTV gets arrested irl: escaping Alcatraz
HOLY FU-   your scary as hell mannn
they cant break a block
it does not matter how powerful the pickaxe or axe is
i put them in there for 5 hours then let them out
This Vault is pretty good 😅😅          Extremely good what am I saying 😅😅😅😁😁😁😊😊😊🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
but a golden rule is broke i will make a contraption that is constantly pushing you around so now you cant get out
when i see someone breaking a rule is fine i will put them in a normal prison
Dude these are awsome in the story of the escape and the mechanics of it. I love it!
The historical trouble radiographically stare because riverbed consquentially disagree excluding a hard-to-find bumper. unruly, whispering friction
Prison creators: builds prison <Two seconds later> Prison creators: why do I hear boss music?
now try to escape your room after you pissed your parents off
I feel like he wouldn’t have enough time if he actually had mining fatigued
13:24 is this going to be the new video Soon?
Next up Gaia's Vault
Why yall naming these after gods?
Could u please Make more of these videos Im enjoying these... N i've watched all of these Vaults.  happy birthday
The doom music was just a perfect tho it fit well with the tnt exploding
my goodness this is so well edited
This man woke up from a kidnapping and chose violence
"you cant get command blocks in survival so i will do it with no mining fatigue" 10 seconds later "im going to use commands to set my spawn in the bed trap"
Gaia’s vault: when’s my turn? Wait you can’t! Haha!
DISCLAIMER: this is not a hate comment, I love this channel and am subscribed I just want to point out something   Is the guards revive stations, or whatever you called them, didn’t have a pick axe, and nor did you render chest, how did you get an enchanted netherite pick axe?
That doom intro at the start
dude this guy is so bad ass
That intro tho
Sheeesh, insane production
how has this man not joined dsmp yet??
When the doom music hits.
Totally Macho! I don't even think Popbob could do such an explosion so beautifully.
Zeus's vault?
Against all the evil that Hell can conjure, all the wickedness that mankind can produce, we will send unto them... only you. Rip and tear, until it is done.
Gaias vault is waiting for you mythrodak....
Next video hades hell pit
I’d never thing of blowing everything up, unless I happened to have tnt in my ender chest or something
I'm waiting for gaias
Escape gaia's vault
EPIC
Bro this sounds like an anime
your vids are so well made love the ant part lol
i made a prison. its unescapable. its made out of bedrock
Ah yes, the DOOM music, my 2 favorite songs of the ost.
Download TNT mods and use nuke(I call it aplha warhead(alpha war head is just 1kiloton of TNT))
your voice is so soothing, also happy belated birthday
You need to try to escape Gaia's volt
I play hardcore and could make a prison legit one block and you wouldn't be able to escape.
Where did he get the netherite pickaxe tho.....
First video from you. It was way better thank most of the first vids from people I watch.
Happy bday!
I like how he sed checkmate
the video was amazing! You have successfully forced my sub to you! It has given me chills!
Happy birthday! if you don’t mind me asking how did you get the pickaxe that we see around 10 minutes and 40 seconds? I’m pretty sure you said that the guards didn’t have access to any picks and it wasn’t in your ender chest, was it an off screen thing or? Love the vids keep up the good work!
That moment when one humongous nescapable prison is maybe a few kilometers away from another humongus inescapable prison
Try guardians vault they say u can’t escape
wow the production quality of your videos has gotten way better. The ending section was really cinematic and everything
The tight peru extracellularly dance because balance minimally last anenst a telling brace. purple, aback octagon
12:00 when the doom soundtrack kicks in
Dsmp quote(i created it):  Mythrodak:Im not trapped here, this my HOME!
This guy is only getting better?       Wat...?
DANMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
Bro you got me subed instantly once the video was over. Excellent content, please keep it up🙏💪
U Said That the guards dident had a pic put you got one from there equiping station       Like????????

This is the best escape yet

The infamous chocolate coincidingly pick because writer spatially surprise like a sincere pansy. majestic, puzzling security
viewers: there is not even a chance of him escaping >:)     30 mins later     main guards: why is our prison blow up? >:(
when the doom music kicks in 5:18 happy birthday :)
Mythrodak I challenge you to escape the guardian's vault. But it is not me that made that prison, but someone did and he posted on his youtube channel called "Thubb" try it, I think you will never escape that prison mythrodak. And also pls reply to this comment pls.
Hey that a on the vault looks like *sus*
Where did u get the pic axe from
ultimate destruction
Hey, this was my birthday too! Happy birthday and thank you for the “gift”! :)

Myth i challenge you to escape the prison with a command block that has the command  /tp [your name] ~~1~
The cultured ex-husband antenatally bless because margin premenstrually pray mid a garrulous locust. tasteless, mature dungeon
Doom refrence? good music from doom tho
In anyone else intently trying to find the music that is playing
Guards:Your trapped Myth: Your trapped with a prison full of TNT. Gaurds: Oh fu...
Checkmate
So why doesn’t he have a pick  in his echest?
Imagine if all the vault builders came together to make an even better vault for Mythrodak to escape from.
war...
Everyone going insane over the video Me, worried about the parrot 😞
This guy has the potential to surpass Dream in terms of logical thinking
HAPPY BIRTHDAY and I found something the warden could be on the wardens area and any of the guards could have a pickaxe in the ender chest of the guards room
I’m impressed
Epilepsy warning 2:16 to 2:25 2:50 to 2:57
I love how after explaining how it is full of death traps and is almost inescapable , his first reaction to being there is just  "aww shoot"
These poor people can't keep you locked up
Broooo I got chills down my spine when u said checkmate
Ajbold the next dream  you the best person to escape prison
Starting to think this guy can escape anything
When he wakes up in the cell: how did we get here?
He when kill mode at the end
The pathetic puffin covalently allow because gladiolus culturally tap failing a aware stretch. synonymous, chunky thomas
This man has done the impossible
After gaias vault ya gotta do the kingstone
Mr Mythrodak, Sven made a prison called Gaia's vault so you should try escaping that.
Omg ur bilt diferent
when the doom music kicks in
When doom music kicks in
guess i gotta make my own prison!!!
You said that the people guarding you don't have picks in their gearsets but you get one from the wardens chamber and use it at 11:26 couldn't the warden just mine to you?
How do you only have 200k subs....  You deserve 10mil at least
Hell Yea Blow The Prison Bois!!!
C H E C K M A T E
poggers
*checkmate*
can you next time not be prepared. I mean you always know where everything is
The "Checkmate" scene is so epic, combined with the epic Doom music
thi- ok i think they should say " this prison is unescapable, but myth can
He LeAvE wItH sTyLe
Make a prison that is unescapable. Thank you. Also HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!
Never before has the word "Checkmate" sounded so badass
ya gotta have some respect for this man, someday a real unescapable vault will be made, and his content will have to change, even so I am still finding myself entertained everytime a new vid comes out, keep up the good work, and I hope you can find something to do after the inevitable happens.
The ending was amazing
Watching the video over again because how epic it is
where did he get the pick from?
Me hearing the doom eternal soundtrack:  huzzah a man of quality
they could fill the prisoners cell with block 36 (the piston glitch that acts like a non solid block but you cant place in it) so the prisoner cant place or break anything so no way to get water to the bottom of the pit even with a bucket. no building up to the redstone elevator, and no way to break a block with one inside you already.
everyone gangsta until mythrodak says any chess refrence
Eat vaults
The contrasts between the acting and the ooc info dumps is hilarious
Hey uh btw this wouldn’t be possible with mining fatigue so that’s why I don’t like these videos. He kinda pretends that there’s a way to win. Mining fatigue would make the signs harder to break triggering the red stone after the cool down. Or in other words the cool down wouldn’t matter because mining fatigue, If you want to show him this go ahead like it. You don’t like it sure, roast me or something.
the way he icely but calmly says checkmate is so cool
The unarmed mallet predominantly support because appliance fortuitously save upon a unnatural cheque. lethal, angry cheetah
12:47
Who next  Mythrodak: looks to gias vault.   Me: it's time
maybe one of my favorite youtubers or even VERY favorite
Try guardians vault v2
Anything with doom music is an instant like
Me:*makes a bedrock box *    TRY ESCAPING THIS BIT*H
THIS IS 1000X BETTER THAN NETFLIX
these vids should be movies
Chills, literal chills
GG
what is it with greek gods being minecraft prison names???
But isn't it ironic that their was wood instead of cobble or something
Absolutely badass ending
He used the doom music really well
The cynical employer climatologically stroke because semicircle medicinally license about a ill conifer. fabulous, clumsy citizenship
that ending is literally everyone’s hopes and dreams, especially mine.
This is like addiction you just need more of these videos more but you got to be patient
2:19 it sounds like he is saying the f word here
Technoblade is learning
the guard could've just held up his shield 😑
How is this not demonetized for using Doom music?
Mythrodak Einstein
Very dramatic
Dude this guy could out brain Einstein
4:50 doom music kicks in (._.)
Do guardians  vault next by Thubb
you fit perfectly with dsmp
The doom soundtrack makes everything so fucking hype
Gaia’s vault… here we come
It's my birthday to day on June 10th
I wonder if they have inescapable labyrinths with like traps and stuff
I wish I could like this video twice
What's your gender cause if you're a girl I say your better than Dream
And no guards see his name -_-
cool
Damn the editing is amazing!!
Still waiting for Zeus’s Vault
When the doom music kiscks in
Chills man, just chills.
Can You escape from Guardians Vault?? ;) (I know u can, but pls for a video)
He got a free netherite set in his way out
Mythrodak a mouth ago:20k Mythrodak now: 200k
Thanks for the entertaining video sir, take a sub
Escape Guardians prison
When the doom music kicks in
But what if u wont know anything about prison?
wait a sec he needed the guards to be afk to leave the real version of the prison?
Guards: put mythrodak in the prison Mythrodak: your free trial of life has now expired
You spelt Aries wrong
the checkmate part was my favorite
"if its a war they want, its a war they'll get" ebic
This was captivating as hell. Good work! 🤩
I really hope they had a backup world file for when mythrodak enviably blew their prison to pieces
Even it does not kill the guards, it is gonna kill their pc
jjkay: Escaping is impossible mythrodak: to make it more challenging...
No worries new prison on the way ;)   After the next prison 0_o
Mythrodak everytime in prison:no u
12:47
Its my birthday today too only 4 days later
Guards - dont have pixackse  Mythrodak- gets a pixackse from guards room anyway.
ulimate doom eternal epic escape
*Doom music starts playing* guards: welp, we're fired.
Gaia's vault nd guardian's vault is what I challenge you to escape from. Big fan :)
WOW THATS THE BEST ESCAPE I HAVE EVER SEEN
That was friggin epic! Your videos are like movies each and every time.
Checkmate *guards suffer*
Ok, now escape gaia’s vault. Still nice job escaping from here!
i realized that every vult has names of Greek gods or pandora that was given by zuse to her
Doom music 4:52
2:19 “fucked”
I love how he says checkmate right before vault blowes up.
1000 iq
Gaurdians vault thubb
I made a impossible one. You can't smuggle items in. Because the only time the guards eye is off you is when he opens the chest. Which only happens when someone visits you. You can't reach any blocks.
this man needs a god damn break
I've watched that checkmate part so many times i dont know why but its so smooth. You did really good at the editing
What about Pandora's vault in dream smp where dream is trapped
The Doom music makes this 100% times better.
Happy birthday MythrodakTV!  The prison was cool and the best part was blowing it up :O
Happy birthday mythrodok
There was a secret msg at 2:23 saying ‘ I’m saving them and there is a pumpkin
The warden can escape using the pearls the warden can use at least 2 pearls so you can likely die
this honestly kept my mouth open
bro your videos and your edit is awesome.
I feel like im watching an action movie
The offbeat bus scientifically kneel because child increasingly perform around a feeble feigned slash. itchy, divergent blue
'Checkmate.' *BOOM*  When did Mythrodak become Technoblade?!
This is a whole movie Time to subscribe
How did my mans go from not having a pickaxe at 10:18 to having a pickaxe out of nowhere at 10:59
Me at start : ok Mebat tnt : DESTRUCTION.
The only thing Prison makers fear is YOU mythrodak
mythrodak: We have to get out quick because we don't know how long that obsidian will last.     Also mythrodak: while i was getting out i spent a little bit of time placing tnt down (but really good vid)
yes, checkmate... *continues building new prisons*
Now... Its time to escape guardians vault😈
*Happy Birthday MythrodakTV*
Mythrodak how did you had a picaxe it was not in your ender chest
Happy birthday
I don't think that mythrodak can do gaias vault
He's 3 trillon light years ahead of you          For safety he plays war
is this scripted or does he actually escape the prisons?
Minecraft is temporary. DOOM IS ETERNAL
The tiresome veterinarian concomitantly trace because pull ordinarily switch following a humorous exclamation. fluffy, null timbale
day 578 escaping from real prison
bro jus alt+f4
The macabre ease contradictorily reign because pint bodily behave behind a illegal fall. smart, smart subway
How to escape: packetfly hack
Dude this is the best vid i have ever seen in my hole life, ur the best editor everrrr
Through out the video , you didn't have Mining fatigue 3 , so only you could escape , am I right?
I think obseidian doesn't gets blown up by TNT , I think it's TNT proof . Am I right?
Hold on a sec.. the Guard's Aren't equipped with pickaxes and only weapons? But you have a pickaxe with you when you are escaping from the prison? (Also when you open the ender chest it is not there.) The only way is through cheating (To get the pickaxe) and yes i do know that it would be possible from using fists but he made a mistake but no hard feelings to him.
I bet you can’t get through min it a  box of wood. It impossible to get through
Ares couldn’t build that if his godly hood depended on it it should be called athenas vault but she’s the goddess of wisdom so it would be impossible to escape but this is Minecraft so
Mythrodac obviously u practiced breaking out multiple time So now I dare u do escape a new prison without practice
Do guardians vault by Thubb
"Checkmate" the strongest game over word
Escape Gaia's Vault
They outsmarted you but you outsmarted their unsmarting
This escape is not work
“Checkmate.” *huge explosion* lol
I will subscribe from all my accounts my mother's, my father's and my sister's account if this guy actually escapes from the Gia's Vault.
5:10 i like that      song:."the only thing they fear is you" from doom eternal
holy crap doom ost fits a bit too well with this, never thought a game about punching and shooting demons until death would fit so much with a block game aobut survival, also happy late birthday :)
These vids are lowkey so dope, keep up the great work!
In the minute 2:23, there something odd
i like how he describes how easily he can escape in 20 seconds without the extra challenge
10:35 mythrodak has a pickaxe even though he said  that the guards dont get pickaxes he also didnt get it from his e chest
Happy birthday mytro
Epic
where did you get a netherite enchanted pick, or is that warden exclusive?
That "Checkmate" at the end was cold af
you sound like L from deathnote
He updated Ares Vault idk how you are going to escape
Escape guardian’s vault, it is very secure. Or is it? That’s for you to find out.
true name of mythrodakTV: THE ESCAPER
how did you get the pickaxe you said that the guards did not have them?
Ok
Really You áre they better i love your videos
Bro this guy does too much work for his subscribers! WE LOVE THIS CONTENT!
🔥🔥🔥
Liked the doom music nice choice
I'm working on a prison called Zeus vault
The wrong botany intradurally bruise because ox accidentally rock despite a poised road. mixed, symptomatic ball
the one time he decides to blow up a prison, he chooses the one thats made of obsidian and has water e v e r y w h e r e
Why is no one talking about the doom music?
They thought they were trapping the mythrodak but the mythrodak was trapping them
literally all these prisons have the word 'Vault' in their name except glacier's orb
Mythrodak's prison videos are becoming less of actually escaping the prison, but more like a cinematic movie
I don’t know what will be worse, the day Goku finally dies for good, or the day Mythrodak is finally improsoned.
10 years later: Escaping Japans Deadliest Prison
Escape my bedrock prison 😎
This video is just one massive when the doom ost kicks in
Okay guys and girls… this will be a long one but pls still read it❤️. So all these episodes of him braking out of prisons hang together. It all started whit the video thats name was something like ”you perfect valentine” or something like that idk. Where he made mr pumpkin. And mr pumpkin has appeared in a few episodes of him braking out of prisons. But where did it all start? Well you see the 10k special he made an torture macine. He is s criminal and a secret servis is trying to get him locked up. It’s why in the first epidode in the intro a mysterios voice asked some guy who built the prison if it was uneskapebl. But he eskaped so he hired a new one to build another one witch could hold him and it failed too and so on, you get the point. And the gray parrot also has appeard in many episodes. Which means that the episodes link together. But idk thats just a theory… a comment section theory!
the doom music is fitting.
That Doom music right there
4:53 when the doom music kicks in-
Geez, you're like freaking light yagami
surprised no prisons have tried making a cell with the floor as natural bedrock. just a huge basin with sheer walls. drop you into water, destroy it by dropping sand, only way in or out is with a pair of elytra and some fireworks to reach the top
‎
You should try and escape Gaia’s vault
Mythrodak will be invited to the DreamSMP to be the one that's going to get dream and techno out of Pandora's vault.
I want Mythrodak to become a member of the Dream SMP purely so he can break Dream and Techno out of prison.
0:42 nobody:  actualy nobody:   me: rest your head, its time for bed.
(Mythrodak)“Hi I’m mythrodak and I’m ready for you to put me in prison now” (Guards)”ok, I don’t trust him”
i like that music i new what it was the first second i heard it
Somone: Releases new hardest prison to escape in minecraft. Mythrodak: Splashy splash, your effort is trash.
I like this but what if the guards have pickaxes like normal Minecraft players.
-now the banker's vault-
Did you already saw the guardian voult ? Sorry if I write it wrong 😅
"There's one thing you never ever ever put in a trap"  "And thats me!"
"Checkmate."                                    ~Mythrodak, 2021
So cinematic
Happy B-Day! And HOLY CRAP THIS WAS THE BEST VIDEO EVER :D
idea: commit a crime and try to escape alkatraz
A round of applause for the god king of escaping mythrodak👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🎬🏛
This is just dope
Escape the new Pandora’s vault
Gaia's vault ain't lookin to good boys
When the doom music kicks in:
This should be a movie
I'm asking myself when they will run out of gods for names
The magenta permission frustratingly decide because astronomy only unpack upon a disturbed blood. crowded, woebegone octave
I've got a prison, it's called "a 10-block radius sphere of obsidian, with 7 maxed-out guards". Very unbreakable security there.
him: nooooo i wasnt prepared 100% no stuff in also him: haha enderchest totems n tnt
When are those guys gonna run out of Greek gods to name their prisons made in a block game
tnt? that's a little tame, it can't destroy obby -this post was made by the wither gang
If he ever goes to prison someone pls give him a camera so he can shoot his escape and post it on youtube
Wheres the parrot? :(
This is my favourite video of yours. The best part is when you said: CHECKMATE
Try escaping a vault in Bedrock Edition. Chests and barrels can be moved and signs break from pistons. It is impossible to escape with this vault.
Happy birthday
Happy BIrthday also the blowing up the prison part was so pro
The doom music 😂
Mythro when are you going to escape SeenSven's new prison Gais Vault?
i mean, if there was lava instead of signs in the pit, you wouldn't be able to escape
Happy late birthday Mythrodak!
When I saw you blow it up I was so mind blown
Do the dream smp prsion where dream is
when the doom music kicks in, you know mythrodak means business.
Keep up the amazing edits Mythrodak also happy late birthday...
cant wait to see you defy gaias vault
He really did do a giant ares at the end
All I can say is pog
the doom music doe. its just great
I’m too invested in this.
One flaw    Adventure mode
He is entertaining but cringy
His birthday gift??.. Well also 1080p50 is part of the gift I guess
Ok damn this guys content is actually amazing...
Has anyone noticed that all prisons have names from Greek mythology? (Pandora, Poseidon, Ares, Hades, Gaia)
Mythrodaktv: No command blocks allowed. Also Mythrodaktv: I will use COMMANDS to set my spawnpoint.
Ur vids are geting better
CHECKMATE!! That gave me Goosebumps.👍
you know it's real when the doom music kicks in
I made a prison but I made it on single player
henlo sir you deserve sub
Mythrodak is just so cool, he has such great plans and always does these animatics, i’m so glad his channel is growing like that and i am patiently waiting for the day where he’ll kill Technoblade and maybe join Dream SMP, who knows??? Anyway, good luck and i really appreciate your work!
that music at 5:11 is sick
"i dont know how long that obsidian will keep them trapped" *specifically states that it takes 5 minutes to break an obsidian block*
here within 3 dayss
this is sooo well made its amazing
The doom music makes this 1000000000000000000000000x better
i just love how good the editing is and the mix of cinematic moments and comedy
Can we just appreciate how he has pretty much creates a movie every video
when the doom music plays
Mick Gordon. Pog!
WHO IS DREAM BRO WHO!??!?!
Tip for the prison creator: just place a tone of lava in the prisner bed so even if he is able to break the bad he will burn in the lava and give you enough time to fix the problem and catch him again😁
Happy bday
I would love to see this man join the Dream SMP or even just a whole entire video where the guards are there the whole time trying to stop him
Who’s next? A bedrock cage🤓
How about Olympus’s Vault?
That ending was insane.
*Vault builder places 1 block *   Mythrodak: YOU FOOL YOU PLACED THAT BLOCK 2 BLOCKS 2 FAR TO THE LEFT NOW I WILL BE ABLE TO ESCAPE
Happy birthday mythrodak you deserve your subs u work so hard on these vids :D
This is the guy that wins skeppy's 100 kids in a bedrock box
Congratulations
And thats how you get free netherite armour kids seems pretty simple!! -mythrodak       Seensven: the key word is "seems"!
Can you break out off posejdons vault
Love how he used DOOM music
we know he has gone mad when the doom music plays
Have you tried one of ray's works "prisons"?
Its Aries not Ares
Fools the best trap is the naturally generated bedrock trap that can only be accessed via ender pearls so the trick is to kill check this guy and give him 1 ender pearl and set up the respawn place and done he can never escape
You say guards don't have pickaxe but how do you became a pickaxe?
amazing use of the DOOM OST
??? why big boi building for such lilttle cell :(
I bet I could make a prison a million times more secure a million times smaller.
The anxious bolt taxonomically drum because fisherman conceptually question until a healthy expansion. far, inconclusive bomb
Creators: Try to escape this one Mythrodak Mythrodak: So anyway, i started Escaping
0:47 omg that gasp was so epic detail
the real inescapable prison is a command block killing u everytime u move
Happy late birthday
Hold up, he said the guards doesnt get pics from the gearing station, and he didnt have one in his ender chest. Why does he have a pic at 10:26 then?
4:31 Ez to escape ares vault
thank you for the doom music
I belive you can esape from gaia valut
12:47 was insane
He’s getting so much better that he doesn’t even need to smuggle to escape
5:10 is best moment :DD
I watched this video more than  6 times,
how did you get the netheright picax   and how did you have inuff time to put all the tnt
Why is the tnt montage so cool.
He went in for free netherite. That's genius.
Citadel 32 chilling
one of the best ones so far
the best video yet....
Yo are those netherite blocks
Easy solution make a obby box that it 100x100-1000x1000 just a box mine a few blocks for elder guardians and to get in the prison you have to mine through all the elder guardians with the mining fatigue which could probs take thousands of hours
giaia,s vault
HAPPY LATE BIRTHDAY FELLOW INMATE!!!!
When Mythrodak said checkmate and the tnt explode is so freaking cool
This guy has the vibe of Money Heist
but woulntd it be impossible with fatigue
Hey
buildin  a prison like that they should have back ups lol
Your cinematic presentation style is just awesome!!!🔥🔥🔥
why do they all have to be named after greek gods??
Gia's vault finally I was waiting for that.
omg that was soo good
The thing u said checkmate is badass 12:47
0:36 looks kinda sus and cursed.
(if its a war they want its a war they'll get) *the Doom music intensifies*  Damn this music is so good for this good work.
Editing skills top notch
Ares Client: and i took that personally.
Heya i am a huge fan and i made my skin based in your
GAIAS VAULT !!!!!!!!!!!
11:15
Ill say it myself, the escape is invalid, see jerrylum's video on debunking this escape
I mean ok the intro...... Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh
The ad aligned with the glitch sounds I got an ad for a PS game lmao wish I had a clip of that
Nice background music choice :)
You have the absolute best collection of music for your videos🔥🔥🔥 you have earned a sub
How long should the intro be? Mythrodak:yes
The way he hinted the next vault at the end...🥵
Thank you
IS THAT AMOGUS VAULT? THE DOOR HAS AN IMPOSTOR
WOW Just WOW !
Have sven and JJ make a prison together to see how crazy it's going to be
The nutritious handball intuitively man because grease temporarily offer forenenst a afraid capital. careless, lethal scanner
Mythrodak, thank you for all you do. Happy Belated Birthday!
Pog
I HAVE A QUESTION HOW DID U GET THAT NETHERITE PIC
That doom music doe
when the DOOM music kicks in: 4:51
This is what happens when you mess with the quiet kid
5:11 *When the DOOM music kicks in*
Nice song
this is why we love Mythrodak 1.His edit is like cinematic 2.his IQ on escaping prisons 3.i love his minecraft skin👀
Guards : WHY DO I HEAR BOSS MUSIC?!?!?!
“Checkmate”
Can you and the people who designs these prisons make a prison for origins mod?
the doom music was a m a z i n g
It’s “fell swoop” not foul swoop
You should try escape Creavite’s new prison which is called Tardos Cone. Go watch his video to see the prison
The cinematic work put into these vids are absurd. What a legend Mythrodak is
4:52 whats the song here
I thought the Gouda didn’t get picaxe show come he gets a picaxe
You fool! You shall know that the mythrodakTV is the ultimate stand at breaking out prisons!
You are a god at escaping prison
Happy birthday to you then !!!!!!!
Happy birthday!
The videos are now 1080p? Nice
jjkay: builds prison  mythrodak: *doom music intensifies*
Happy birthday
Fucking memes the prison lmao

Bankers vault
I was outside of cell service. So sorry for not say Happy Birthday.

"if its a war they want its a war they're gonna get" CUE THE DOOM MUSIC
try the gaia's prision
I’m very sad because Ares vault wasn’t exploding or in shambles when Mythrodak was saying “Who’s next”
i like this guy
Try escape mine: 2 by 2 bedrock cage with the spawn point inside it
MythrodakTV is Benchmarking his new PC with Those TNT.
Mythrodak after escaping from Pandora, Poseidon, Hades, Titan, Glacier, and Ares: Checkmate. Who's next? Gaia: Allow me to introduce myself.
U have a pickaxe and before u dont? 😅
This guy in two weeks finds out how to escape a giant minecraft prison then gives us a god tier video with god tier editing
Woah
It works like this you push big red button, number go higher, Mythrodak is happy :) XD
So... you play doom huh? Well hopefully you can doom your way outta this
Happy birthday sorry this message is late also after Gaya's vault try Tartarus by MiningBlob yes he made a better prison than the other models that were made by him (this is just a suggestion this is opinional and it won't let me reply but happy birthday sorry I sent this late enjoy)
"The only thing they fear is you" is perfect in this video
Bro this dude got out of the prison but also destoryed it making it temoraly inactive so he can escape a differnt prison
12:47 "Checkmate"
Hey, try escaping guardians vault by thubb
The gliching seems like call of dutys
OK WHY HAVE I JUST SEEN THIS THIS IS SO COOL
my Zodiac is Aries Lol
theory: mythrodak probably named his parrot "shiratori" because of the famous japanese prison escape master yoshie shiratori.
this, my friend, has earned you a sub.
Nice doom music
Normally I’m not a fan of MineCraft creators but I respect this guy for the doom music
you said they dont have pickaxes then how do you have one?
if make mythrodak big happe then I subrib
i love ur use of BFG Division while u blow up the prison
He says the guards wont have pickaxes but he has one when he calls the guards??
3+ stacks of tnt: exists in inventory the whole chat: TNT  BOOM OMG POGGERS BIG BRAIN
Epic
4:51 Doom Eternal Intensifies
Mythrodak please escape Gaia's Vault
You said they don't get pickaxe, but you got a pick, also that ender chest thing is just pretty bad, you ''just happened to have things in you ender chest''
10:26 he just gets a pick axe even tho he didn’t have one in the ender chest and said that you don’t get them from the equipment station
Pog
5:03. I almost thought this was doom
Destruction.
That *DOOM* music tho
What’s the music at 5:12
I'm pretty sure that he never actually goes in the prison, its just a tour showing it off for him.
When the DOOM music kicks in
someone should just challenge him to try and get out of a cube of bedrock.
OMG if mythrodak figures out how to escape Gaia's Vault he may as well be jesus
*YOOOOOO THAT WAS EPIC*  Also happy belated birthday :D
Do a face reveal
Fool, the fastest way to escape is to just leave the server
10:25 why do i see a pickaxe?
I love how he called his bird Shiratori like the guy who escaped multiple prison in Japan
imagine disliking
"Checkmate" - MythrodaxTV 2021
I wish the vault name was the arse vault
arse's prison
Hey do u want to escape da‘wirna it isn’t official out but if u want to try just say it but u won’t get out

The end is badass
Happy late birthday and my gift to you is subscribing I also have a idea for a prison for you but I can’t make it myself since I’m not good with building, red stone or that
I KNEW I HEARD DOOM ETERNAL MUSIC
Dang instead of just leaving he literally leaves with a bang, best vid ever
DOOM XD
seeing a Hephaestus's vault would be a cool design i think idk
Next video: I escaped the observable universe with nothing but a can of Pringles and 69 orbeez.
BRO WHEN HE SAID "... checkmate" i expected the WORLD TO GO BOOM
When the doom music kicks in
Guardians vault next
If he’s still doing this in a year or so, I’d love to submit a prison for him to escape!
Happy birthday yo
THE DOOM MUSIC MYTHRODAK  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
mans botha cinematic genius and a minecraft genius
nice vid
Bruh this is CONTENT who will not subscribe to his channel

He should make a prosin that is truly inescapable
5:09 when the doom music hits difrent . 12:48 THE DOOM MUSIC EVEN HITS HARDER
can you try to escape the Guardian's vault PLEASE
To me the outside looked like a bank
Shee
𝐂𝐡𝐞𝐜𝐤  𝐌𝐞  𝐍𝐞𝐱𝐭  𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞  𝐈𝐟  𝐘𝐨𝐮  𝐀𝐫𝐞  𝐁𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐝  𝐛𝐫𝐮𝐡. ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■
This would make an amazing movie
That Music deamm
İts time for the Gaia to learn her lesson
Where'd u get the pickaxe from BC u said guards only get weapons armour and gapples?
we still doing this type of content?
The doom music lol
the editing is awesome
You need to do more videos like this
What if Mumbo Jumbo teamed up with Grian to make a prison
ggs
I am sry but you said they dont have a pickaxs but you have one how did you get onz
12:47 Mythrodak trying to make it look cool by playing high volume music me laughing at how he made it 1.5x speed and made it so dramatic just cause he needed more watch time  XD
mine now
:/
can u make a discord
Wait I swear he said u can’t get a pick from the equip station but he was holding one when he was running away
can prisons just not have a ender chest?
Man I love how he use the animation  and the the last trap "checkmate"
Mythrodak in 2030 be like: Escaping Alcatraz with a pencil and half-eaten sandwich
2:23 theres one frame where plumpkin says I'm saving them what dat mean? Edit:is it plumpkin or pumpkin
Hey Mythrodak, I made a prison for you, and I have a video with details on my channel. Lets see if you can escape it.
Absolute checkmate.
Doom Music very pog
One of the more drmatic ones
when a escpe artist in mincraft gets angry, proceeds to destroy prison with the guards in them 10/10
You need to do Gia’s vault
If I knew he was gonna blow up the prison, I would just skip to that part  BTW your editing is awesome no wonder you get so many likes
10:35 hitting the button lol
5:10 be like, TUN TUN TUN TUNN TUNN TUNNNN
You made that explosion thing at the end so awsome
TRY Bankers vault
When the doom music kicks in
“Who’s next.”  (Looks at giasis vault)  Me: ( BREATHING INTENSIFIES
At 5:11 What’s the name of that song? It’s badass.
Fun fact: Every prison is inescapable. But it doesnt matters for who
PLS DO GAIA'S VAULT
At this point they're just giving him things to escape
Ok this is kinda badass.
Lol
lol nice fusion boys music
You are growing up so much in subscribers damn
This guy needs to be on the dream smp and with this prison escaping lore, that would be awesome
There is no prison that you can't escape........ Yet
Even if you lock him in a double bedrock cell, he will escape and take revenge from you!!! You are awesome Mythrodak.
You're a genius, and also the editing of the video is insane
soon this man is going to escape the underworld
Also, there is also a secret message in this video. At 02.22 - 02.23 and play it on 0,25 x Speed, you can see in one of the frames it shows Myth's Best friend/ friend ( The Glowing Pumpkin Head that you can see in one of his escaping inescapable prison video) saying "I'm saving them", It implies one possible of the "Them". It could be talking about he is saving Myth and his bird friend, Hitachi from the people who made inescapable prisons by removing partial effects of the sedacutive chemical that the guards used to poison his water supply, so that's why he can see and remember the security checks in the prison.
You are the only person who can save technoblade he needs your help and Dream he might need your help too
Awesome 👌
If you can try to escape my odins vault
i love it its so intese and just straight up cool man
This is the best video so far
DUDE WHAT IS THE MUSIC DURING 11:49 I REALLY WANT ITT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE MYTHRODAK IN THE DREAM SMP
Just be ready for my prison this will be fun
Idea to make the vault harder wardens are spawned in the pit incase of ppl breaking the wall in this method
Man says ares not aries
Hes so skilled he could even escape my prison called depression
Pls make on Gaia’s vault
They should add brute piglins in the vaults
People need to stop using Ares as a formidable opponent. He is a bully who cries and runs off the very moment someone bites back. A regular soldier stabbed him in the heel with a spear and he ran all the way back to Olympus, complaining to his dad. In response, Zeus essentially said “nepotism is the only reason you are still here”.
The doom music got me...
Pog!
13:15 - me... try all you can but you will never escape. wait for me, for i will come.
Everybody gangsta until mythrodak says “checkmate”
Now this. This how to do good editing
bro cant wait for mythrodak breaks out of alcatraz
that’s what she said
what about gaia's vault
Can these people please give the prisons a original name
Pls escape guardians vault
this is some really good video
I personally don't like the prison design where you have to click on a bed at some point to be imprisoned. It detracts from the narrative for me because no knowledgeable player would click on a bed inside of a prison unless it was for theater. There is no way to force another player to use the bed aside from commands, mods, or hacking. The only way to make the bed trap believable is if you convert it into a prison while they are gone, and then kill them. I would like to see a compact prison designed around something like that. Bonus points if you can incorporate a death trap into the base so that you do not have to locate the person, corner them, force them into pvp, and win. It is quite difficult to kill someone who has fireworks and rockets given the fact that they can fly above the build limit and log out, making themselves untouchable to traps and inconvenient to spawn camp.
10:25 where do you get the pickaxe? you said that the gurads dont have pic and you dont get it when you get in that armory, in that time it just appeard in your inventory, kinda wierd dont you think :/
Guards after imprison Myth : why do i hear boss music?
You did not have a netherite pickaxe at 10:19 but somehow you got one at 10:26?
My god the one in the end looks terrifying
The DOOM music and editing made this easily the best escape video yet
Am I the only one who wonders why the guards keep putting him in prison in these mini-stories? -._.-"
What is it with people making massive prisons for only a couple people... at least it’s prettier than pandora’s vault
you can't break blocks with swords in your hand make a prison based on the prisoner having an invontory full of swords!
UPCOMING: GAIA'S VAULT
The distinct sardine nomenclaturally dare because teller early rock aboard a stale voyage. poised, silky home
That seemed wayyyy easier than other escapes lol did you power up on your birthday
try and escape guardians vault PLEASE
12:46 "checkmate" TNT:KABOOOOOOOOOOOOM
its not fair beacuse you cant break obsidoan wall with you fist when there ir mining fitigue 3
When doom eternal song kicks in
Just found you and one word: underrated
the video ending just look like a scifi movie
this some goooooood content
I’m surprised nobody made a titanfall 2 reference with ares and ares division
the editing is *chefs kiss* 11/10
AYO WTF HAPPY B-DAY THIS WAS SICK
What if you made a cell that put the prisoner in a constant state of dying?
This is the most epic mjnecraft video i've fucking watch dude Good stuff
give me some of your brain cell
ikd how many brain cell this man has
To many prisons
Did anyone else know Mythrodak share’s Technoblade’s birthday?
You can actually set your spawn in the day
Houdini
5:12 when the doom music kicks in :>
mythrodak is so good he got verified before reaching 1 mil  w o w
i absolutely love the editing on these videos! happy birthday :D
mythrodak is big happy :D
BRO ITS SO EAZSY TO MAKE A PRISION ARE U GUYS DUMB ALL U DO IS JUST PLAY OBI
Extra lore poggies.
This should be a movie!
Escape the kingstone and guardians vault I guess next vid is Gaia’s vault?
Why is soo many prison voult  😡 😡
When the doom music kick in.
Mythrodak is probably the best chess player
I’m starting to think he breaks into these various prisons just so he can break out
What was the exact song from the doom playlists? Especially the one from the end, blowing up the prison.
He got 50k subs in two days my man is a legend btw I watch it I just comment late
I literally subscribed just because of how good that plug was at the start
Now, THIS is the content I subscribed for!
The snotty playground externally belong because route angiographically continue into a amused ukrainian. piquant, momentous paul
Truly a work of art, beautifully put together, continue what you are doing and you can pursue anything
Happy birthday!! Hope you has a good day.Sorry for being late😅
Call up the homies
Who's next you ask Joe is
Ah yes my favorite part is the explosions
this is the best ending so far o.o
OMG THIS IS LIKE A MOVIE
Sir your dropped your crown for the most badass minecraft edit ever
0:45 : _exists_ My ears: *bleed*
But mythrodak, why did you get a pickaxe   in the wardens room when the guards don't have one?
Is there any prison this man can’t escape??
the plan consists in having the blueprint of the entire prison,  two weeks to study the contraptions before getting captured and an engineering degree
*Badass video and doom music, I love these prison escape videos now.*
What are we gonna do when people run out of names of Greek gods...
Prison i wanna make but am lazy The Conduit Its a water based  And looks like a conduit. Levers to change water to lava, button to start cobble generators as hallway blockers The prisoners cell is a single obsidian block, underneath is a 50 block fall into 1 layer of lava, the walls have observers behind them so when blocks break, guards are alerted, when they hit the ground they die and loose items if they have them, the cell is visible at a 10-15 block away using glass, and obviously 1000 elder gaurdians, the bed trap has  observers that check for a peice of Redstone that is active because the bedtrap is working, when it stops working the Redstone peice is inactive so the observer sends a signal to guards that the prisoner broke the bed respawn system
Where did he get the netherite pick at I was not in his enderchest it was not in the armor equip station 10:20
5:28 a lookin sus
mythrodac if one guard has a pickaxe like literally any normal player should: 🧍‍♂️
Remember guards always bring a pickaxe
This is some insanely good editing, amazing job
certified masterpiece of a video
Whats next houdini
He just speedrun this prison and he didn't want to make the video boring so he made it harder. This man is a legend!
Why am I not subbed to this guy yet??!?  Edit: happy birthday btw
2:18 i hear “this system is fu**ed”
This dude really just casually mention how he could escape the prison even if it had mining fatigue
How to escape a bedtrap?
I think it would be reasonable for the guards to have at least a regular diamond pick
I KNEW THE DOOM MUSIC WAS FOR SOMETHING
0:35 that's terrifying
The painful pimple interestedly enter because memory etiologically include aside a magenta october. drab, abusive ant
Everyone gangsta until the doom music kicks in,  also this is the only thing they fear is you doom ost if u are wondering
Disturbia
prison: is "inescapable" mythrodak: and i took that personally
i felt so bad for that guard
bro this is sick
well how did u get the pickaxe... u cant get them in the prison.. and ur ender chest didnt have pickaxe... good work tho
HOLY FU- THIS IS THE SICKEST ESCAPE EVER
bro i started watching your videos when u had 3k subs and now u have 200k awesome growth
just wanted to say, bedrock is breakable  and a brazillian descovered it.                    🇧🇷|      |<(▪︎v▪︎)/ {im bored :D)
Wow, your plans are so elaborate! This is amazing! And I saw a video on Gaia's vault.......it definitely looks near impossible to beat. But you have not ceased to amaze me. Keep up the good work! And I just want to give a shoutout to the people who created this, because that is actually amazing. Especially with only 2 people, and I am very impressed. I am about convinced that Mythrodak is impossible to imprison.......but I am yet to find out.
i recommend a trigger warning for the noise when you are knocked out it is triggering for some people including myself! thank you!
"i could do it with mining fatigue" half of the things he does require time and deceit to get that time, if he had to spend 8 hours breaking the obsidian block there's no actual way they don't find him, even if the guards have mining fatigue too
happy birthday
This some anime type shit.
SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE da edits tho
I met this guy
happy birthday sorry i am 2 days late
dude i fucking love doom music so it made the video 10x better
Subscribe to maximuselitist for minecraft and more!
missed a chance to use god of war music to fit thematically but maybe you didnt for copyright reasons its understandable
It was so cool! Incredible
My skin is mostly black....hilariously
Make a face reveal
RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA *gets 900000000000000000000 iq*
*turns super sain 9000000000000000000000000000000000000000* if its a war you want ITS A WAR YOULE GET
Hold up... How did he get a pickaxe???
Yo this editing is fire
DUDE THAT "Checkmate." LITERALLY GAVE ME *CHILLS*
the next will be so epic
*The coolest music video ever*
happy birthday
Umm, so uh... Techno's stuck in pandora's vault with Dream now, maybe you can give them some tips??
Before the actual video starts he break the prison in 10 seconds 😂😂😂
I swear my birthday was the 4th!!! Anyways nice video!
Zet if seeng this:reviewing
"Welcome. I'm Dr. Mythrodak Hayden i'm the head of the escapists. I think i can escape every prison made and now, i'll be explaining my excellent plan and i do believe so it will benefit us both." yes im bored and its 4 am lol
Keep using doom music and you will keep getting my support
I fear no man, but that thing....it scares me.
Ares is my actual name no joke btw you dont have to belive it..
holy shit this is so good
Have you tried getting out of Gaia's vault yet?
what does this guy even do to get captured
Bro the use of the doom music is absolutely lit.
HAPPY BDAY!
This editing is really good
That time u said Checkmate gave me CHILLS!!!!!
The end was satisfying. Uhh quick question where’d u get the pickaxe
sick
Your videos are always Quality!
i never knew minecraft  can be so epic lol, great vid, you deserve all the love  Mythrodak
Checkmate
6:30 , just break the 2nd redstone ore
THIS WAS SO BADASS
Awesome dude :dream can't escape this prison even with a tutorial Awesome dude later when midorak realis escape ING the pandora.s vualt  I got to stop dream from seeing this vid
13:15  I’ve been waiting for this…
This was perfect in literally every way possible. I liked the bombing of the prison so much I’m literally subscribing
hes like THE boss of escaping prisons
Those that tasted the bite of his blade, called him... Mythrodak
BROOOO SO BADA*S
People always talk about an unexcapalble prision, but why dont they find a place to get stuck in bedrock? You cant die from hunger in normal mode and just box it with obsidian and mining fatigue to block it from anyone entering it, you dont need that much of complexity.
I love u. I subbed
“  Quoted mythrodak : if its a war they want, its a war they get. Me:    _~_ we know that. Its more of a 10 - 1 pvp with the one boi in full netherite.
*people who make prisons* no Guardians just a command block is okay... *Mythodak* nah no command block + no Guardians = VIDEO!!! But happy b-day
It was a hella entertaining video, but at some point he randomly dropped the assumption that the prisoner doesn't know the inner workings of the prison.. He just went to every exact block, mined the exact obsidian block in the pit, mined the exact pieces of redstone he needed to...
One word to describe this whole video: art
nice job this is so well done :D
Normal Person: Ok guys time to see if we can escape. Myrthrodak: Time for a CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE!
i made him BIG HAPPY
if I had been the guard in the tnt scene I would've said *nope* and just placed the obsidian back and hoped for the best lmao
Literally a catastrophe
How much prisons can you escape?
THIS MAN DESERVES MORE THAN 1 MIL SUBS
When the doom music kicks
epic quality content
You've gotta start making videos about Minecraft Wars now, this is fantastic.
One brutal way to go out, get blown up by the person You trapped, in a trapped place. Mini prison death.
I've been watching exactly 7 minutes and 26 seconds in and I'm sitting here simping for your voice.
If there are 2 guards online they can call the other guard and warden and they can contain you back. Is what I’m saying possible?
What happens when the prison creators run out  of Greek gods?
Wow this guy is so good
got my thumbs up just for production value. 10/10 editing
Can’t wait for you to escape Gaia’s vault to
This guy should be the sixth hunter. You know what I'm talking about.
Mythrodack:Who's Next  Me:Gaia's Vault
I made my own Minecraft Prison called Mars' Vault. A blood-red fortress filled with traps and defense mechanisms to keep people in, as well as Mutant Snow Golems to attack the Prisoners if they try to escape. The Guards and I also have Armor/Gear Equipping Stations with the most OP Gear for us at the ready for us in case we die. The walls are 5 blocks thick with another 3 blocks of lava in between each wall. And I, The Warden, have the most tricks and techniques to get around the Vault and more features for stopping Prisoners from escaping.
That doom music do be slapping hard do
mythrodak you know about Ga ais vault right, well someone called jerrylum made a debunk video about your escape and this time jerrylum work with seensven to make Gaais vault
THIS EDITING WAS INSANE wow just wow
If this guy actually go’s to prison he’ll be a escape god
When is he escaping Gias Vault?
if its possible to get bedrock in survival somehow, this man will be able to escape an bedrock box with nothing in his inventory
10:26 where did the pickaxe magically appear from? there wasnt one in your ender chest lol - fake?
Me and my friend are building a prison
You hit big red button =Happy Mythrodak
Happy b day mate congrats how old are you?
I never thought something in Minecraft could be legitimately epic but dude the outta with  the mick gordan was fire
Mythrodak: The guards do not get a pickaxe from their equipping stations. Later go to equipping station and gets a netherite pickaxe. Me: So only you get a pickaxe now?
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Escape Gaia’s vault
Best and most creative video yet
your videos about escaping Minecraft jails have no right to be this hype.
Ok but Gaia's vault is gonna be insane
THE OPENING HOLY SHIT
I get serious anime vibes from this guy.
I wanna see you on the dream smp. youd be a character to rival even technoblade.
do u think Mythrodak is the hero?
this is like those call of duty scenes
You just passed SeenSven in subscribers, it has been done, we can now rest.
Thanks for destroying my eardrums at 0:46
2 things: 1 - the doom music was very fitting and it made it 1000000000% better. 2 - Happy birthday Mythrodak! spend it well!
these videos are amazing
solution:just put walls upon walls of regenerating cobblestone in a maze(that the guards know the layout of) and put loads of elder guardians
Doomythrodak
God dam this was like a movie, awesome job 👏
THE MOST BRUTALEST, BEST ESCAPE EVER
Happy birthday brother
this needs to be a sad-ist animatic
Me when It gets to the "Blowing Up the Prison" Part:  "Why do I hear Megalovania?"
Gaia's Vault
GAIAS VALUT POG POG PGO
When the doom music kicks in...
On my server I used to have my prison was a bedrock box at world height with obsidian inside to give people a false sense of hope
How to contain mthrodak: put him in a 3 x 3 cage of netherite blocks with mining fatigue three
this gives a new meaning to "when the doom music kicks in"
amazing as always mythrodak
have you heard of the bankers vault, sire?
Wow not oneley did you escape you also blew up prison and crashed there games
I just love your way of storytelling
Belated happy birthday mythrodak
I like the way he explains how to get out in less than 10 seconds, but then he made it even harder for himself and then still escaped
The doom music fits so well
this guy is like thelockpicking lawyer but with minecraft
this is the man who you dont want to see at your front door beacause it means you dont ave much time to live
gotta love the doom music
when he places the sign he gets paused so there is no one in the world
10:26 where did the pickaxe come from?
Mythrodak, if you're going to prison, might as well make sure that you earn your sentence right? What if you used hacks to escape some prisons you have already escaped?
The plain back interestedly fade because headline inevitably float at a limping spruce. cowardly, entertaining spring
Anyone else was shreding when the doom music kicked in?
The guards could get out and possibly get their stuff back by braking the barrel and placing low enough in the bubble elevator to swim down and drown themselves because the bubbles would be gone after the respawn they could get suited up again and chase you through the halls or camp the portal.
This is my 1st video watching you and im impressed I instantly subbed ur narrating everything else is amazing this is great.
Sick intro
couldve just served your time in the first prison but nah now you're a fugitive wanted by the fbi
The mining fatigue is actually really important, because of timing. If it’s taking you 3 hours to break one block, there’s a good chance a guard will notice, and kill you.
HOLLY CRAP BRO YOUR VIDS ARE JUST AMAZING
This guy is getting really good
You’ve earned a sub because of the quality
me just vibin to the doom music
The cinematography and effort put into these videos is amazing, keep it up!
Well... RIP Gaia's vault I guess.
Gotta love the doom soundtrack
“Checkmate” -Mythrodak 2021
The guards when they capture mythrodak: why do I hear boss music
5:03 HAHA THAT WAS SO EPIC
Kinda cheesy
I’ve made a prison with my friend and I got many ppl to try and escape it. They couldn’t. Plz if you see this could you consider possibly trying to escape it. I promise it’ll be WORTH. YOUR. TIME.......
Check mate
This video is better than most of the movies I've seen.
The doom music 😩
I love 12:46
Gaia's voult?
I've calt with sennsven
Mr. Rodak,   I may not be able to make massive prisons, but I can do so much more. We will meet, and only one of us will walk away.  Sincerely, Mr. Question
A great video,  I love how it was edited!    also happy b-day!   (even if it was a few days ago)
This entire video was just a Bruh moment. Very impressive :D
Would the piston push you back into the cell because the observers would pick up when you break the redstone ore
wow.
Gotta appreciate Doom Eternal music in the background!
you said they didn't  have picaxe to break those blocks but where did you got a picaxe
the shadowy casm in the prison could have gotten rid of all the bedrock (ITS POSSIBLE TO BREAK BEDROCK using the glitch to get to the top of the nether and back!
I cant wait for the escaping gaias vault vid
sven earlier: WE MUST CONTAIN DREAM! sven after: WE MUST CONTAIN MYTHRODAK
Are u also MichealLovesArt !!
The cinematic editing and execution of this video is astonishing.  Marvelous job.
can you make a escaape from one where you really know  absolutely nothing abt the prison pls
ngl the music at escaping the vault is kinda badass
Mythrodak: Gets out of an "inescapable" prison AND Gets A full enchanted netherite set
The editing is fire
This was fucking good.
This is so in your favor in many ways it normally wouldn’t br
So... What if: The guards are observant, brought their own pickaxes, and you didn't have time to prepare your Echest?
Edits keep on getting better and better!
Happy birthday! Also try escaping my prison lol
Just place bed rock over the void and set the world spawn take away everything and make sure it far out in the void
YES! GAIA’S VAULT UP NEXT! LET’S GOOOOO!
LOL IT HAS 666K views
Aren't se gonna tali about how much his skin looks cute With the netherite armor on?
When you hear the only thing they fear is you from doom in a mythrodak video
POV:Doom music kicks in,Mithrodak:😎
Bro the doom music fits so well with this
This is THE BEST editing i have ever seen and im incredibly impressed
happy late birthday!
With how much this guy gets trapped it must be like wakes up looks out his window immediately sees a big structure        here we go again
I subbed just because he made a supper good sub request
I know a prison, where there are no ways to escape.
Try the Gaia’s vauot
These aren’t prisons for Mythrodak, they’re escape rooms for Mytrhodak
This man is the Houdini of Minecraft
oh god
I know an inescapable prison , swords can not break blocks so have a 1 by 1 by 2 obsidian box and fill their inventory with swords, so when their drop them they just pick it up again
what about gaia vault
just found your channel, now one of my favorite channels on yt. the voiceovers and editing are great
E
another piece of great content
Pandora’s vault: *Fuck this shit I’m out, uh uh, fuck this shit I’m out, no thanks*
5:10 doom music kicks in
bedrock cube the inescapable prison
this video was so contrived and cheesy idk why i like it but i did. i hate myself.
Mythrodak should do like a minecraft prison break series 👇
Can we just appreciate the doom eternal music for sec
You're 19
HI!!! can you make a video on how you come up with these escapes?
5 minutes into the video: escaping the ares vault ))))))))))
does anyone realize he gets a pickaxe out of nowhere not from the guard gear or his enderchest and without the pick it would be way slower.
When the doom music kicks in
The only thing they fear is mythrodak yt  Escape eternal
Happy birthday but u said that the gaurds were not given pickaxe but u had one netherite pic how pls reply
How does this man make a minecraft prison epic
are we not gonna talk about this part 0:34?
Man is a fking genious
Next : escaping gaia's vault
they have no piks him oooo pik
I really like the video, but a lot of your plans require the guards to not pay attention or be lazy about certain things for a while. It's be cool if you had  some friends to be like a list guards and find a way to escape with them trying to stop you. Like a dream manhunt but inside a prison.
What did he do to get imprisoned in the first place?
we are going to run out of greek gods
Pros:Thousands of block           Bigger pros:Three bedrock
Doom eternal soundtrack lol....
Oh my god, you are soooo good! I love your videos!
This guy can brake free from a bedrock box with only a ziplock bag.
I swear, there is some kind of lore to this videos, and I WILL find it!
Belated birthday wishes MythrodakTv
It's literally Poseidon's Vault 2.0 on the outside. I thought it would be like the Colosseum since Ares is the God of War, he says it in the video.
The dramatic element in these just keeps getting better and better, it’s truly cinematic. Also happy belated birthday.
I cannot lie and I have to be completely honest this video gave shivers down my spine the editing the music the overall story this is some of the best content I’ve ever watched
did you name your parrot after the prison escape artist Yoshie Shiratori because you escape vaults/prisons?
Amazing! how do u think of this stuff??
The most creepy and scary minecraft youtuber whith techno being a close second.
They really gonna make God prisons
I wonder what do you keep doing  that makes get trapped in all these prisons
happy belated
i can make somthin u cant escape but i it will require 12 bedrock
5:29 amoung us
THE ENNDING WAS ACTUALLY EPIC OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Its spelled Aries im pretty sure
I can do better Than that
mythro ur scaring me
Do guardians vault
I used to believe these were real until this vid came out 10:17 no pickaxe at all and then boom 10:26 a netherite pickaxe magically appears
Bro he makes it like a movie  Also happy late birthday
How did he get the Pickaxe. It was not there and just came in his inventory when he cut the scene to the calling guards
Where did he get the pickaxe? Am I just dumb? Didn't see when he got it. I don't think it would matter anyway
Checkmate. -MythrodakTV
Mythrodak deserves to join the Dream SMP he is so good at lore and stuff and he plays Minecraft as well as knows about the Dream SMP, he would have such an interesting character
He did it again
Did this remind anyone of call of duty?
This is the most bad donkey escape since, well..... ever
buuuut it dosen't
Can't wait for a new "zeus vault"
at the end i was screaming at my screen "BLOW IT UP BLOW IT UP" lmao
me
I love these vids, but in the beginning you took out the command block to make it escapable and said that you can’t get command blocks in survival, which I agree with, BUT you called the Garuda back which used command blocks to teleport them back, so that sorta ruins the whole survival thing. Once again keep up the vids
This is some EvanMCGaming quality right here
Gotta appreciate the right usage of Doom OST's
The doom music and immersive aspects just make these videos so much fun to watch, like I get so hyped xD
Last time I saw something like this it was quackity doing Lore
Sheeeesh the checkmate
With all of his knowledge on ESCAPING prisons, how good would he be at making/testing them?
now escape a real prison
Yo
Nobody gonna talk abt a netherite pick appearing in his hotbar..?
Mc player: *builds "inescapable" prison  Also mc player: why do I hear boss music
The guards after spending days building the prison 😑
Everyone Loves To Imprision This Guy
this is extremely epic with the cool cam angles and the doom music
Just saying that's not how birth days work
Mythrodak, I challenge you! I have made the most secure base in mcpe. You must escape. Solo. Can you escape an inescapable prison in a version your not familiar with?
I LOVE YOU CRASY EDITING AND CONGRANTS ON YOUR BIRTHDAY but plz try to Escape Gaias vault
Doom music, u are my daddy
13:16  are we just gonna ignore gaias vault or uh
nice edit
your birthday is 2 days before mine lol Edit:it’s actually 3
nice editing
Mythrodak saying something is secure is like Jeff Bezos saying he’s poor
This man can escape barrier blocks at this point
The way you just perfectly timed that 'Checkmate'.👌
Him: talking about Redstone  Me: what are you sayin??????
You get a like just from the doom music alone, fantastic video!
The dramatic element in these just keeps getting better and better, it’s truly cinematic. Also happy belated birthday.
How did you escape my vault mortal?
I love how he said check mate
mythrodak and dream : our brains are so big mmmm
epic
Make a MC Prison Makers Handbook
your videos are like im watching an ultimate action movie!!
How do I subscribe twice
i just love the "checkmate" and then the epic cinematic shots, awesome vid dude. Keep up the great work!
new vault name: Kratos vault.
This video was as epic as ever  Great job :D
VERY ETERNAL!
this was the best video so far tbh
The way these videos are edited are so good. With the camera shots, the DOOM music, your sly and cocky tone and the pacing it blends into one of the best Minecraft channels I've ver come across - keep doing what you do (also happy late birthday) :)
I am constructing a prison. I am calling Cthulhu's lair. I truly think that this one is inescapable.
if you did have mining fatigue you wouldnt have done this they would have got you
Happy Birthday             To      Mythrodak
Holy crap! That was awesome! Truly enjoyed that! Nice music taste! ;)
Happy birth day
what did he do to get put in all these prisons
I love youre vids bro
Lets’s go! Dramtic vid hey bro Seensven made one more prison
When you escape a prison and rob them at the same time:
Happy birthday.
DUDE WHY DID YOU BLOW UO THAT PRISON THOSE GUARDS HAVE WORKED SO HARD ON BUILDING IT DUDE I BET THEY MUST BE SO ANNOYED LIKE DUDE IF I BUILT THE AND YOU LITRALLY DESTROYED IT I WILL BE SO ANNOYED
So your entire plan would be debunked if the warden was online. Why? THE WARDEN IS SUPPLIED WITH A EFF V NETHERITE PICK
They’re doing it wrong, just make a two block high dirt block and mythrodak will overthink it to the point where he will never escape.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
Escape Bankers Vault or Vault 36
Happy birthday!
Do Escape gyas vault
I bet this guy wasnt even birthed he just escaped his mothers tomb
If u gonna escape pandoras voult i will give u my house POV:IMPOSIBLE
Happy'birthday party

People naming Minecraft prisons [greek god name] vault.
4:50 when the doom music kicks in
Ares Vault II: Elder Guardian Edition
Hi
11:48 Mick Gordon - 11. BFG Division its not the other doom soundtrack
Mythrodak is helping me pass my greek mythology course ty mythro
Just realized that if someone makes an inescapable prison on an smp without making a video or adding a world download, you probably won't be able to break out because you don't have time to find flaws in the prison
the guards having fun till the doom boss music comes
Doom fans when 4:52 hits; yoooooooooooooooooooo let’s go shoot some martians
The ending was awesome!
Rip the guards.
the intro for subscribing is great i haven't even finished the video and just for that i am subscribing
Best...ending...EVER
Loved how you blew it up
My birthday is tomorrow
this is my first time seeing one of his videos but the intro got me to subscribe
Wow, that ending tho
Pov that who is next to make the vault: they say "omg if i build my vault my whole vault destroy"
5:12 when the doom music kicks in
12:48 checkmate
when the doom music kicks in  5:11
holup you said the guards don'y get picks but you did from the same dispenser?????
0:44 i thought "Well he just got fucking stabbed. Good video"
your my favourite and happy birthday!!!!!
Is it even possible?
ESACPE GAIAS VAULT
The Doom soundtrack fits perfectly
WHERE IS GAUAS VAULT
I always see these but never click but HOLY SHIT.  WOW. This shit was intense
I’m excited for you to escape Gaia’s vault!!! :D
10:33 wait but how did you get that enchanted netherite pickaxe? we could see it wasn't in your ender chest, and you told us it didn't come in the guard equipment equipping station, and we could see that you didn't go anywhere else that you could get stuff. Looking a little fishy...
This one is probably ur best video so far tbh
The way he said cheak mate
Gotta love the doom music though
I like the doom soundtrack :D
Happy birthday (I know i am a day late)
mythrodak: Today, we are escaping the inescapable prison built with 6 blocks of bedrock. All I need is 💦
When the DOOM music kicks in
When the doom music kicks in
Your videos are amazing! I also really like that you have a story going on meanwhile you break out.  Also, happy late birthday!
Next up: Escaping a barrier block box
"Ares was the god of war, and if it's a war they want, it's a war they'll get." - Mythrodak
If I made a prison it would have stasis chambers that can teleport the prisoner back into the prison should they escape their cell.
D

Sorry that I missed your birthday but happy birthday
Nice.
Happy birthday mythrodak
How about with mining fatigue AND spawnpoin inside the prison?
doom music be kicking
Ah yes, the doom music.

Happy Birthday!
13:24 ohh shit he gonna do it.
This gives me serious Mr. Robot vibes
Cannot wait for Mythrodak to take on Gaia's Vault
Hi Hi HiHi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi
When Doom music kikes in
Me wondering how Mythrodak got a Netherite Pickaxe when he’s in the guard’s room.
i require your font
We need a full Mythrodak lore!
Next houdini (Man that can escape from anything)
Wow, the blowing up thing is genius. The hole plan is genius. I’m telling you.
POG
Fun fact: his parrot shiratori is named after a Japanese man who escaped many prisons that where said to be impossible to do so
Happy Birthday
they over complicate everything all you need is a small obsidian box surrounded in more obsidian ddeep in the nether roof with no portal
dudde u scared me with that tnt part
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MYTHDODAK YOU'R ALWAYS AWESOME LOVE YOU'R VID
Ready, Mythdrak The next challenger for you…                  Gaia’s Vault.
whats next camp half blood amd jupiters vault ?
When I saw gaias Vault I was like: *Boss Battle*
0:32 Mythrodak proceeds to explain what Subscribing does:
Mythrodak should have directed endgame
The cinematic features the effects. This will have to be a movie in the cinema
When the Doom music kicks in
his pc must be really good to hold that much tnt explosions...
Happy birthday
All these people making  prisons and  all u need is bedrock box
Where’s shiratori
"There aren´t traps that can´t be turn againts the trapper." -Grand admiral Thrawn, 1 after battle of Yavin (Star Wars)

Nobody:     Mythrodak when the doom music kicks in: I *AM UNSTOPPABLE!*
Guys he said the amor equip station has no Pickaxe but somehow he has one and it wasn’t from his enderchest
Just build a bedrock box and have them escape that

i haven't seen a prison escape video in months and all i can say is wtf
I bet he couldn't get out of the dsmps prison. Pandora Vult.
50k of you people could have subbed but didn't 😔
It all started with pandoros vault  Dont mind the spelling mistake
Happy birthday
Houdini: I escaped a water cell that I was completely stationary in, and able to survive. Myth: that's cute.

Doom Music made me suscribe
do the guardians volt it is small but effective
oh man i cant wait for geias vault also grammer
Ohh yeah gaias vault Seen Sven will be excited
Even though you dobt want us to sub if we dont want to, i did because this was a good video
Boss: So is he going to be locked in here forever Builder: Well yes, but actually no. Mythrodak: >:D
A
HAPPY BIRTHDAY @Mythrodaktv I am making a cosplay of you and I'm almost done can't wait to show you!!
Happy birthday!
All I have to say is !SSSHHHHHEEEEESSHHH!
Me wondering what crimes he did
MAN WHEN THE DOOM MUSIC KICKS IN SHEEESH
yo this was the best Escaping Minecraft's Deadliest Prison series because when he blow everything in the prison it looked so cool and it made Mythrodak look like a badass
When the Doom Soundtrack hit
sven before : lets make a prison where dream cant escape for sure! sven now : i need to contain this psychopath so he stops leaking my prison's mistakes
this guy is a genius, escaping with mining fatigue on the demonstration
10:05 ajthebold revenge videos be like
The Doom music you added is amazing
Happy birthday MythrodakTV Hope you and your family are doing well!!!😁😁
you need help
I feel like the one fault with this video is assuming the guards do exactly what you think they will, if they went to the wardens Chambers right away, the whole plan would be over
Ah yes doom music
DANG IT I WAS BUILDING IT
the static buzzing is sensory hell for most neurodivergent people
How did he get a pickaxe
Checkm8
The bored scraper oppositely scold because chauffeur ideally recognise a a awesome rocket. agonizing, warm prison
“Because my skin is mostly black” lol
*clap* *clap*, hands off to you man, probably the most sick thing i have ever watched and HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU!
I love your videos! They are very entertaining with bits and pieces of story in them!
myth wtf, how
Me thinking the music is epic; my ears: AAAAAAAAAGEYDUDBEB
13:15 me
The whole plan is destroyed if the guards have a lil pickaxe!
The editing- bro
this song made everything 10000000000 times better
Go on, beat Gaia’s Vault, I dare you. (If he does I would recommend the name TATARUS’s VAULT)
I like the "checkmate"
why is this man so cool?
0:33 that is creepy
Mythrodak: (Inserts Doom Eternal Music) Bravo six, going dark.
Happy birthdayyy 🥳 🎂
Hey wat is they use picks for fighting
This is not just an escaping tutorial, its a movie.
Imagine if this was a movie...
BRO! YOU *NEED* TO DIRECT AN ACTION MOVIE! A PRISON ESCAPE, NO DOUBT! A live action one of anything you do, but especially this one would be absolutely insane. This. Was. EPIC! Absolutely incredible!
Love the video, could you do Gaia's vault for the next video?
if Mythrodak was a mexican, he's prison escaping skill would be tenfold.
This video is almost like a movie lmao
13:23 CHILLS!!🔥🔥
at 4:57 what's the song called i kinda liked it
Well I’m subbed, I gotta say you made something pretty normal in to something very entertaining,  and The  choice of music was phenomenal. Way to go lad  Edit: I also have to mention that the story telling aspects of these videos are great as well <3
epic and happy birthday
how to escape every single prison: 1 put all ur items and pets on a secret room so no one gets them 2 get aprisioned 3 buy another minecraft account 4 get all the things of your room and be new again all it costs is 25 dolars
"now i need to run, i dont know how long the obsidian can keep them trapped, oh, i also filled all the prison in TNT"
This is some of the most well put together shit I've seen. I should be paying for this
ur content is fucking amazing
Holy he got out trapped the guards killed the guards got op gear and blew the place up
when the doom music kicks in lmao
How are u so cool
happy birthday!
every one else: acthily watching the vid   me: Jaming to the doom sound track
Happy late bday btw
I loved that ending it was so dramatic and cool
Sh*t went from technoblade scheming to doom eternal in a single video
I'm gonna try make the "Illuminati's prison"
So I was hovering irl (as you do) when I realised that the bird is named Shiratori after the guy that escaped every prison he was put in. I feel smart.
You should escape Tassaru's smartest prison xD
Already subbed, and again I love your editing and the doom music
It would be Good with a killcheck every minute....
If the bed trap was normal this prison would be inescapable
bruh you should make movies
This video has the most badass ending possible
As you said it would take them 10 minutes to get out of the obby unless they had pearls then it would take 5
if mythrodak answers this comment i'll subscribe, that way we're both big happy :)
YOOOOOOOOO
doom music made it just so much better
finally an mc prison with my zodiac sign
Mythrodak is like a rat
Yeah dream made a fault. And then you had to take it extreme wtf:/
My mom: do homework Me: im watching a movie
Vault 36
The dramatic music and mythrodakTV in third person was AWESOME and such a HYPE
hype for gaias vault
I missed ur birthday by a day, but it's better late than never. I wish you luck, love, happiness and subscribers.
Damn! That was so dramatic!!!
I dare you to escape a bedrock prison
The doom music do be boppin
OMG THIS ONE COMES
I love when you said “checkmate”
Wer gia valt
He didn’t just escape it he fricken found a way to completely destroy it
i have a question, i think you cheated, because after the scene where you blocked wanden enderpearl chamber next second you had a pickaxe, which is NOT obtainable for guards, neither you had one in e chest. I didn't watch the creation of prision though, so im not sure.
“My skin is mostly black”
Realistically I think someone imprisoned would have a wayy harder if not impossible way of escaping since all of this is assuming you know the schematics of the prison itself
Holy crap.  I’m so happy he used the doom soundtrack over this. It is epic.
Pls be a movie director ur too good at editing and skillz
Dude you have grown SO MUCH WTF
It's me or everyone thinks about God of war game while watching his videos
Top 10 best minecraft movies
Coolest video ever
SICK!!!
Mythrodak has plot armor
Jjkay:Builds massive prison  Also Jjkay: I'm ToO lAzY fOr ElDeR gUaRdIaNs
Why am i watching this for free
Escape the vault of kratos
HAPPY BIRTHDAY =D
10:33 how did u magically get a pick axe without getting it from your ender chest or from a guards armour equipping station
The guard equipment thing literally gave you a pickaxe so the guards actually have a pickaxe try again bud
happy bday Mythrodak
The editing is on an other level! Good job man
Video starts at 13:38
I love the last part that was lit holy damn
the best thing about MythrodakTV is tht while just normally escaping the prison he also adds a storyline which Is just too good for the video. Honestly man, u should get well over 1 mil subs. Also today is my birthday too :)
When the doom music kicks in
yoooo your too smart                  :D
i love how cinematic your videos are, and this one is such an awesome example of that bro. from the intense lines to camerawork all of it just feels so perfect 10/10 content bro keep it up :)
"Mythrodak you can try to escape it boi"  Mythrodak: *ez, done, but i need content so i'm gonna give myself a challenge*
Legends says that no matter how hard the challenge is, there is always someone who is up for it, and they will eventually complete it.
could someone please tell me the seed of the Minecraft world?
going to escape from gias vault next
Tomorrow is my birthday and Wow Happy Birthday
MAKE A PRISON
Build your own PRİSON
Why don’t ppl just use a bedrock cage :/
You Just Can't Stop Him
yo i was thinking can u escape the blackhole
I just made a Mythrodak a big happy and I'm proud of myself
the cinematography is fire, its like death note style intellect and felt like a movie
Clever and fun to watch keep on going
Amazing 🔥
to SeenSven and all you other prison builders: stop trying. you'll only make a fool of yourself. Soon Mythrodak will escape rays works prison too.
someone makes an inescapable prison  mythrodak checkmate
yo gaias vault is next
Yay I is make you happy
Love the Doom music
why did this go so hard-
THIS IS GODDAMN EPIC
Next level Video
You must be related with sirius black or barty crouch...
So, I wanna know if u have any idea on how to escape Gaia’s Vault?
pumking saving them :) (good eyes)
The Doom soundtrack, yessss!!! Rip and tear, until it is done…!
"Checkmate."
5:00 when the doom lands music kicks in STUFFS BOUT TO GO DOWN
gaia's vault next
They make giant prisons all you need to do is go to max height surround the prisoner by bedrock
If *MythrodakTV* was my cellmate we all be *Checkmate* as i ate i'll be the *Ace* [I'm Bad at rhyming LOL]
This is so good
"I guess its like every other GENERIC inescapable prison" --- Oh the burn.
Guards: get a pick axe  Mythrodak: well sh**
10:25 He had no pick and that he said the guards only get weapons and not tools. Then all of a sudden at 10:28 he did? Wat  Indian video tho! Don’t know how you do these!
Excellent Video Keep it up BRO!
dude this creator are dumb just use bedrock cuz can glitch it in end
Next episode: Escaping Alcatraz
The doom type music fits so well. Great video man!
mythrodak: whos next? me: yay finally gaia
his fault for not putting the guardians
Myhhrodak some days later : hello guys today im escaping a real prison whit a rock
There is 1 prison you can't escape: a prison you had never seen :)
i love u just for having doom music in this video it made it 100 times better especially for the fact that u had two of my favorite doom music the only thing they fear is you and bfg division and i think meathook too etc
When Doom music kicks in: escapin boiii!!! When ultra Doom music kicks in: BOOOOOOOOOOOOM
Prison: Has command block,  'Not Allowed'  Also Mythrodak: I will be using a command to make it harder.
I always Used to ignore these Videos and Once I gave it a Try I felt like i was watching A action Movie. Keep up The editing ans story My guy
Bro this man has ♾ IQ
My birthday is also in June
It's now my birthday :D
The edit was so cool               also happy birthday Mythrodak
I will say again the quality of the video is fucking cool   Sorry for swearing :D
The doom music was a nice touch
Hapy Birthday i must say ur crazy in vinding a way out of every prison LEGIt Anad have good logic to it u make it harder and stil vind a way i must sayy ur realy cool to watch entertaning videos no help from outside people its AMAZING keep up the work!
The burly emery apparently snore because grandfather conclusively boast through a half ravioli. cut, jagged competition
if you see mythrodak didnt have a  picacxe when he get the armour and the ender chest but next he has a picacxe because he need help to brek that netherrite block so you see this is all lie
i like how he escaped easily
‘Ello
Holy flip this is soo good
Happy birthday
not only did he escape, He STOLE armor and trapped the guards
Geez, you're building in more plot? Hell yeah, that's some good shit, I look forward to when you join the Dream SMP. Also, happy birthday, I will become 13 in a few days as well, so hello, fellow gemini
DOOM
Mythrodaks videos be like Mission Impossible all over again.
You might as well take this netherite blocks if someone is doing it on your server.
It was my b day to
3:30 I was not ready for this transition
Did I hear what I think I heard?  2:19
These are so improbable but we can see them working so...
Go do guardiens prison
i have one in progress. All you need to know is: Bedrock Cell
Mans name is myth and he escapes from myths of Greek gods vault
He's escaping prisons more than my grades
THIS IS SO SICK!
Build a base below the void no escape unless u use a
It feels like i am seeing a movie
*doom music plays*  *I instantly pull out a sawed off* RIP AND TEAAARR
Wen the Doom music kicks in
Every defense in prisons that MythrodakTV has dealt with: *Starts falling apart*
.
Comment for statistics
That doom music though
TO  MANY  VAULTSSASAHHHAHAHAHAA
why are these videos so high quality?!?!?!
Ur great man. Keep it up
BUT IT COULD
YOOO BFG DIVISION NO WAYYYYYY
GG Man your the best also happy borth day
Not the content we deserve, but the content we need
I dont understand, you Said that the guards dosnt get pickaxes, but you have one 11:00  Great video btw
Bruh.... 11:25 y do u have netherite PICKAXE??? 🤔🤔🤣😂
I wonder when the day that Mythro cant escape a prison will come ( probably never)
Amazing, just amazing lol
when the doom music kicks in:-
SHEEEESH  mythodrak Netflix you better hire this man as an actor for the minecraft prison escape movie his Cinematics are BADASS so netflix you better hire him
this had no business giving me the adrenaline rush that it did-
Man just made a Human XP farm😂
the music is so cool
MWAHAHAHHAHAHAAHAHAHHA THE DOOM MUSIC! I WAS CACKLING WITH PURE GLEE AT THIS
How did he get a netherite pic
the music choice<3
This is by far the best video ive ever seen
Everyone else escape it in 3 hours   Mythrodak dose it in 2 seconds
Imagine losing to a dude with a weird set of eyes because you didnt provide your guards with pickaxes
This vid was honestly amazing
11:47 its one of the best minecraft cinematic edit out there i stg
What about gaias vault?
Why everyone want to put MythrodakTV in the jail.What MythrodakTV was do?
You know i always thought why everyone want to imprison him. But then i remember, escaping a prison is illegal so kinda makes sense everyone wants him locked up
The only thing they fear... Is HIM  **Doom music intensifies**
This guy has been in more prisons than me
Is there a prison that’s not something out of any mythology and then vault
Why is none making a technobllade vault? He's the bloodgod isn't he?
I don’t understand half of what he is saying but ITS AWSOME ANYWAYS
when the doom music kicks in:
your production quality is insane, can you tell me how long on average it takes to edit a video?
bet  you cant escape a dirt house with a eff 5 netherite shovel its impossible
10:30 what a nice cut from obi to a netherite pick.
If i could sub twice i would AMAZING VIDEO!
*Hey, to you reading* .. you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Waiting for gaia's vault which is inescapable. It is just a big chunk ban area
Editing is amazing
Lesson to self: Always keep god apples, totems of undying, TNT, obsidian, flint and steel AND MOST IMPORTANTLY PICKAXES in an ender chest.
masterpiece **chef kiss**
Mythrodak , how did you get that pickaxe you said that the guards don't have pickaxes and it wasn't in the ender chest ? 10:26
rock music
A tip for mythrodak: just play epic music at the beginning and scare the guards off before your escape
the first youtuber to have a cringe gaming intro without it being cringe
okay, tbh, if they DID have mining fatigue, this would legit be un escapable
Oh I would be so upset after putting hundreds upon hundreds of hours into building a prison just to have Mythrodak escape just like that
I would actually be interested in watching Mythrodak escape a prison without knowing anything about how the prison works (like a real-life setting).
*Techno gets trapped in the prison with Dream*  Next Day: *Mythrodak has joined the Dream SMP*
3,2,1 BOOM the entire prison is dead GG
One of the rarest vids where the prison creator actually does the capture
There is no prison this man cannot escape
10:51 Um, how did he get the Netherite pickaxe?
The madly baritone oppositely sack because sister-in-law psychophysically mend off a agonizing foot. decorous, aboriginal estimate
jjkay03: wha— so he makes it harder by setting a spawnpoint at the prison..? okay wtf is this man
The ending was so sick
Mythdorack is a god of Prison escapes
Dude I love the cut scenes
can someone give me the title of the movie
you should play factions and learn it yes ik grinding is boring but raiding/patching isnt
Gaia's Vault: nervous sweating after that
Holy shit this is quality stuff. especially the last part
lets gooooooooooooooooooooooo Gigas vault
Happy birthday
Sorry mythrodak, your replies is full, so I am wishing you here, Happy birthday dak!!
SICK DUDE THE CHECKMATE PART WAS AMAZING AF. AM NOT SURE IF I COULD CONTROL HIM AND AM THE PUPPET MASTER CONTROLER OF ALL
At this point i just wanna build my own prison for mythrodak to notice me
I am confident there is no way he can escape rays works prison.
Genius
There is a easier way.    /ban <player>
were gonna run out of Greek gods before mythrodak cant escape a prison
Epic
The doom music was perfect this is the reason i subscribed
Such amazing vid
This is not just a prison video. This is visual master piece that deserves an Emmy award
Everyone gangsta until they find out why Mythrodak keeps going to jail
fun fact nobody cares about this comment
Is anyone else scared of mythrodak now
How did you have a netherite pickaxe if the guards dont have one
um is anyone else confused on how he got the neatherite pick with efficiency 5. first he got into the wardens room and he said that they didn't give the guards pickaxes and he didn't have it in his e chest then in the next frame when he is blocking of all the guard ender pearl staces chambers he has a pickaxe in his inventory that kinda sus.
Says he won't use command blocks but uses /spawnpoint.       *Bruh*
That is one of the best prison escapes that I ever seen. Now the guards and whoever make the prison will fear before Mythrodark as he escape and destroy every prison he went. One of the best things I watched in Minecraft videos. You have more than earned my like and subscribe for this one.
Make a better prison, I could
Doom music: *Starts playing* The gaurds: well, we cant do anything about this anymore.
Big happy lol 😂😂
Hey mythrodak, try making your very own prison and try to escape it. (Or, You can't do that?)
You left the prison better off then before you went in amazing!
Umm hey can i be the next prison builder? Yes, im just gonna put you in a bedrock box if thats ok, oh thanks
This was AWESOME
this guy used sedatives in Minecraft and Mythrodak still escaped
Wait,where did you get the pickaxe?I thought that the guards stuffs doesn't have pickaxes?btw your content is absolutely amazing!
g fkn g
Happy Birthday,Congrats! Hope you had fun!
Just put dream in and it will end the prison series jeez
Okay that was sick
this was a great video and i am look forward to more of your content <3
bruh just add elder gaurdians if UR not lazy noob.
Love the content dude. HAPPY BIRTHDAY. Just a video idea: what if you built a prison then had other people try to escape
Mythrodak, you couldve made a button instead of a redstone torch so it wouldnt be a beacon
Sick! And that soundtrack hits REAL hard with that aggressively distorted Bass guitar! Fits perfectly for this one😃
I like the doom music
I can’t get enough of these prison escapee too good
I can make a impossible prison to escape just make a bed rock room with no windows and doors
I love the use of the doom music it really fit the mood
Now they made prison named after Roman god of war
The doom music really kicked into you huh
When the doom music starts playing  Guards 😶😬
The doom soundtrack brings it all together and his casual voice as well
Next video : escaping alcatras
"checkmate." that was so perfect
This escape requires the knowledge of the prison and how it works. What if you don’t know how it works? Or where things are? Amazing video but try escaping without any prior knowledge of the inner workings of the prison
And soon, the days of story began...
Can you try to escape guardian's vault plz
i press red button make u go happy :D
When the DOOM music kicks in
Dream should collab with you
This mans videos have no right to go as hard as they do
How can u get the pickaxe ? it's not in the ender chest
I sub to mythrodak to him be Hape boi
Absolute god tier editing. Happy birthday you get a sub bro.
lmao there's lore in escaping minecraft prisons
Happy day late birthday. I hope that you’re still happy!👍
Oh Hey! I'm An Aries.
When the Doom music kicks in:
HOW ARE YOU SO SMART!!!
Next time you should put wither skeleton heads and soul sand in your echest. maybe instead of putting off tnt to break the portal you do a wither
Video ends but the new prison is in the video at the end kinda Nether With Water
I don't have words !!!   WHAT🥴😶
Ok well that was very cool
Plot twist he joines the dream sap and get dream for the power over all the land than he can’t go back into preson he has to Mitch power and turned evil
This is soo cringe lmao he's trying to act badass but his voice sound like a 13 yearbold trying to sound deep lol
Espace giga's vakt
The doom song playing is all they fear is you LOL
I was tryna download ares cilent bruh
Broooo the Doom music really makes its job
happy bday man, youre one of the most genuine and creative creators rn and i appreciate the quality so much
Now this is what you call quality escape with excellent explanation and dialogues
Final boss : gaia vault
YOO LOVE THE BEATDROP ABSOLUTELY SICK
This has more lore than Mexican Dream from the DreamSMP  🤣
I like that you played bfg division at the end thx for uploading this
I’m making gods hands a prison it’s amazingly hard with my plan
why are all of the prisons [greek god]'s vault
and the server just crashed
This guy is smarter than most minecraft youtubers, he deserves more credit
How did you get the pickaxe if you said the dispensers don’t give pickaxes??
AMAZING...FABULOUS, this video was put together very well and probably took a lot of effort, that’s a sub from me!
When he said checkmate the first thing I remembered was the old days of call of duty ghosts at the last mission they were on a train and before they kicked the door down to get rorke  he said “when I say checkmate hit this train” with loki
Fuck that Doom music hits so hard and goddamnit I love this escape.
How come went you went to the guard loot up station, you got a sword and pickaxe, but then when you trapped the guards, they didnt have any pickaxe to break out from it. They should've had a pickaxe too
inescapable prison: 2 block high obsidian wall, including a bed surrounded and 10k guards.
When the doom music kicks in 5:03
A very good video bro i see all your videos And by the SeenSven has made a new prison gia's vault try escaping it
This is just a chef’s kiss
Your videos keep getting higher and higher in quality.
When the doom music kicks in
Bro, they literally had an enderchest the whole time? No pickaxe for sure...
Love the music btw
awesome
Checkmate...
Dude, what about Gaia’s vault.
they're gonna run out of greek gods to name these prisons i tell ya
How's this guy so smart? also i can trap you with my command block knowledge Happy Birthday (Belated)
Editing: 10/10 Content: 10/10 Mythro's checkmate: 10000000/10
My favorite part was when he played the DOOM  music at the beginning
Them not spelling Aries right
So how did you get the netherite pickaxe? you said it didn't come with the armor. There weren't any picks in your Ender chest could you explain
This guy is the El Chapo of Minecraft
I wouldn't even be surprised to see Mythrodak get whitelisted to break Dream out. After all, he is the most qualified
I love prison break out videos they’re pretty intense but I love the ending of them the most
Wooo
can we just take a moment to appreciate how much work even went into all of these prisons.
Hey 11:48 this was the best thing I could have asked you
If he goes to jail I don’t think he’s gonna be there for long lol
i love how so many people try to rival pandoras box but they fail hard, this is what i would do:  step 1: go to a random place a solid 20 thousand blocks away step 2: dig down to bedrock and try to find a dip in the bedrock where if you fall in without blocks, you cant jump high enough to escape step 3: reinforce its surroundings with obsidian but leave a hole where the prisoner can drop down to the depression step 4: escort prisoner to place and push prisoner in hole, make sure they dont have any block and give them a stack of steak step 5: seal hole and conceal any traces of player activity  speaking in RP terms, the only way the prisoner can escape is if someone finds them accidentally, the other ways is if they fail rp and broadcast their location using f3 and minecraft chat/ any form of chatting with one another   lets say its the dream smp, no one knows where the prisoner is, the prisoner cant theoretically die and escape, so dream will be in true total isolation
By the time he finishs they could have beat the ender dragon and get a netheright pickaxe with effecy 5
I like the doom music
HHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHLOL THATS SO FUNY HA
In the scene where you break a netherite block, you have a netherite pick, however you said the guards have no pick and your pick in your inventory just suddenly appears.
Ngl, I'm kinda sad the prison wasn't a giant vase
u said u broke 3 redstone but u stayed in the same spot just reset the break
I love watching your vids. The doom music really amped it up.
he be walkin doe
the editing is masterful! you deserve 10 million man. always excited to see your videos
This was by far your best prison escape video yet
happy birthday man!
I know this can guy can escape but what I want to know is who captured this guy?!
I need dis man's soundtrack
the music made this so much better than it needed to be
At this point I think he's delaying gaia's vault cuz he still hasn't figured out a way to escape
Good idea blowing up the place. 12:11 Epic music
Anyone notice Chinese ad?
Best subscriber sell out
4:52, I know something big is gonna happen, the doom music kicked in.
This guy makes the most suspensful videos even though the video is about escaping a prison in a block game
These prisons are getting out of hand. I love it.
At 2:23 you can see a picture of what looks like the pumpkin and words reading “I’m saving them”
I’d sub and like if it was just the tnt at the end! This was so lit! Love you Mythrodak! Mapping Birthday!
I love that this is basically a conspiracy escape RP series
His edits are so damm good
I love these vids
What a fitting choice of music. Excellent.
Wonderful editing! I love the way you explained the details of the prison as well, very creative!
Wow, JUST WOW! The execution and script of this "movie" were just insane.
Cool
when the oom music kicks in
GAIA’S VAULT IS NEXT
He just nukes the place
Amazing musi
Cool
bro u r too badass
You realize this is from Pandora's box On the dream SMP?
At 10:24 he doesn’t have a pickaxe in his inventory or hot bar and at 10:26 he does. You said the guards don’t get pickaxes.
12:20 "im not gonna let you hurt anyone else" tHaTs wHaT thEY DO theY imPrIsOn The PeOpLe ThaT hUrT oThEr PeOPlE
the music selection is perfect. doom is eternal.
Where is Gaia’s vault
Happy Birthday Mythro
I make Mythrodak big happy today
next video: escaping a bedrock box with a stick
that checkmate was legendary
dude this doom music fits extremly perfect i love it
Minecraft players make a prison  Mythrodak escapes it  Mogang makes a prison  He   escapes it  Noob 1234 makes a prison its a bedrock box  Mythrodak POV this is so hard to escape it’s clearly impossible
Lol
"Checkmate"  Probably the guards : "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
I love your content
Happy b-day
No offense but WTF IS WRONG WITH THIS MUSIC
Your videos are so greatttt
the music fits so welll
Next time pls do a flash warning i have epilepsy and its can end deadly
I was gonna skip the music bit, until I realized how awesome it sounded
Happy birthday
hope they had a back up server ;-;
poggers
Who’s next:  A giant mountain covered with obsidian
5:10
AT 5:11 IS JUST HYPE
13:24 ok but serious why does Gaia’s vault look terrifying here
One of these days he's going to post:     Escaping prison IRL.
Next up, escaping real life's deadliest prison!
Ok that outro was insanely cool
yummy bfg division
You know everything is getting serious when the doom soundtrack kicks in
Love your vids
When you enter with nothing then leave with full enchantmented netherite
The dislikes are all the wardens and guards from previous prisons he’s escaped
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
This is turning into an Anime and I'm not sure if that's a bad thing
Wait how did he get a pic but the guards didnt
Gotta be honest, these cinematics are awesome! Keep it up!
Mythrodak: *uses DOOM music* Me, a DOOM player: "Finally some good f*cking music"
whats the music when his captor is talking to him?
"Checkmate." *doom music starts to play*
Why is every  prison named after a greek god?
Try to escape gais vault
this probably took a long time to edit and create
Bro escape gaias vault
the smiling mythrodak is so cursed
arguably the most badass escape from Mythrodak
When the doom music kicks in
Nobody: Valorant Players: >:D
Happy birthday Mythrodak. I love this videos they are so fun to watch. The choice of music was so good keep up the good work.
next: bedrock vault also next: escaping bedrock vault
10:32 where did you get the pickaxe? I understand you can still break without it, but I think by then the guards would have caught up  It doesn’t matter though this video was a banger
The mining fatigue one you said would be boring wouldn't work anyway as you said there's always  guards so how will you mine it when their afk if theirs always atleast one guard and even if they go for a few minutes it's not long enough to mine it with mining fatigue 3  Love ur videos tho legend keep it up
dude that last part was edgy
Others in Comment: "Hahaha he wrecked that prison." Me: "...Yeah with pre-knowledge of where every trap is, how everything worked, removing the miner's fatigue buff which could have stopped him, and acting like the guard's killing him is Game Over or something when they already suicided multiple times right at the start..." Others in Comment: *Pitchforks* Me: *Holding up hands* "I'm just sayin."
Happy birthday! :>
These videos are always so cool
well happy birthday then, i hit the subscribe button for u
I think Mythrodrak actually have better video editing and storytelling skills than prison escaping skills, and that's what's make the video so entertaining :)
The doom music😂😂😂
happy one day late bday :D
POG
Doom eternal music fit perfectly
I’ve wondered can the person just not click the bed? If the guy kills him won’t he just respawn At his own house?
sven before : _lets make a prison where dream cant escape for sure!_ sven now : _i need to contain this psychopath so he stops leaking my prison's mistakes_
Mythrodak in 2055:Escaping a irl prison
this gives me THE NUMBERS MASON WHAT DO THEY MEAN vibes from the intro
Happy birthday!
It’s so fitting that he used songs from the Doom (2016) and Doom Eternal soundtracks, made this video 10000000 times better!!
mythrodak in 2030: Escaping Alcatraz! "All I need is a rose and 3 beehives
Boi you get sub from me you funni man.
Im surprised someone hasn’t done a animation of one of these
Someone: *makes an “inescapable” prison*  Mythrodak: I’m about to end this man’s whole career
bruh i love how he is panicking at 10:46
I thought you said at the start that you didn’t have enough time to prepare an elder chest?
when the doom music kicks in                11:48
The person who built this whole thing:
When I first saw the video and I saw him almost getting out with all the TNT... I had an idea😂 of what was happening next
damn, the production quality was really good on this one and the Doom music fits really well
badass
Force Drista to give you a bunch of bedrock then make a jail out of it with now windows and it has many layers of walls 2 blocks high one block wide with layers around that until you run out of bedrock. Best. Jail. Ever.
Breaking obsidian under five minutes with mining fatigue 3? Thats not real buddy
I want this man to enter the dream smp
When he is pressing the call guards button you can see in his inventory that he has a pickaxe, sooo where did he get that???
How did you meka a cube game so spookie
This may have just been a 13:38 long YouTube video, but I felt like I was watching an episode of a tv series.
Just trap him in a 1x1 layer of bedrock 4 blocks deep no items nothing and one obsidian ontop of the bedrock no way in hell you'll excape that
What an awesome video! <3
This prison break series is basically the new Minecraft manhunt
How did you get an enchanted netherite pickaxe from the guard equip station when you just said that the guards don’t have picks
is that doom eternal ambient music? lol
wow
Bruh all you need is a corridor, beeg hole, and piston next to a bed with a pressure plate. These vaults are waaay too overcomplicated.
The videos keep getting better
*forgets to grab their parrot*
I’m new to this genre but why does the music go so hard hahah
nice doom music
Uses doom eternal music 😭 that's amazing
"who's next" - Mythrodak.  this was so menacing.
the doom music tho
5:09 You're welcome
The only thing they fear... ITS YOU
Dude you deserved soooo much more subs and views You videos are sooo epic
This honestly gives me crazy anime Vibes, i fucking love your vids
BTW what u said in mythromail ep 3 isn't true ur videos don't need to be really serious or dramatic have u seen those 100 days playthroughs they always act really serious and everything has to be really dramatic and no funny meme clips or jokes socksfor1 made a 100 days he made it interesting while adding funny meme clips and jokes and every episode you will be guaranteed to laugh or cracking a smile
The Only Thing They Fear Is You. Fitting choice.
i love how she said checkmate
the doom music fits
Not only is it impressive how he escaped but he makes the entire editing of the video impressive
How did he get the pick
Free stuff for him lol
yo mythrodk i am making Godzillas vault
When the doom music kicks in
The doom eternal soundtrack fits well with the video.
best video ive seen in ages
him: * starts speaking before blowing up the place * me: **fnaf 6 ending flashbacks**
Is just a matter of time until a prison will be perfected! Just wait!
The word Aries has an i in it
Prison remind me a little of the royal mint of spain
Sheeeeeeesh
Nice.
The Doom music made this 10x better.
wait til he sees obama prism
What’s th music outtros name?
Your editing is getting better and better every video
I have a great idea for an *actually* inescapable prison, but I’m too lazy to build it.
Damn i remember watching you at 13k, u have done so well, i wish nothing but the best for ur future
gave me chills
No my prison is the most secure its called thr bedrock box
I just gotta say you are BADASS😎
Wow #9 on trending nice 👌
When the Doom music kicks in
We all found this channel because we were curious how to escape the prison, but were all staying to find out about the lore.
INSTANT LIKE for the Doom Eternal Sountrack
When the doom music kicks in
I like how done Mythrodak is with this shit, he’s escaped so many prisons he is just done and essentially speed running prisons
this man just escaped and took guard gear and left like it was nothing
Guard: “Breathes” Myrthodak: “Now this, I can use as an advantage”
When you hear the doom music you know something is going down
Why wont someone make a prison on a end island where escaping will get you killed by the dragon  and enderman
Hes to good
HAPPY LATE BIRTHDAY MYTHRODAK
Now do a prison live
NOOOOOOOO
2:17 did he swear?
I love the way you filmed this video. I smiled with my entire body while watching! 😅 Keep it up!👍
MythrodakTV when he sees the word vault: I CAN ESCAPE IT YOU STUPID PRISON GUARD
Big explosion, that was perfect.
when the doom music kicks in

Apple
What did he originally do to earn this?
When the doom music kicks in
mythodrak you really blew up congrats man

You're not gonna stop until you cover all the greek gods are you (I would love it if you did Artemis and incorporated arrows in dispensers or something like that)
*Its A Block Game Why Does It Fell Like A Movie*

No Prison can Hold Mytheodak for Long
Kaboom? Yes Rico, kaboom

Next is kratos’ vault
I like your videos  And also try bankers vault
Now do it without commands
bro, doom music works so well with this
Epic
Try to escape poseidons vault
some prisons in my eyes are way over sophisticated, sometimes it doesn't have to be big and grand, some prisons are not that big and are very secure. but usually the over sophisticated prison are really cool😂
In one of the frames in the entry process it says “I’m saving them”. That’s creepy lol.
“Checkmate” that’s the most anime thing I’ve ever heard
this is what i call quality content
Happy birthday 🎉
the way he talks reminds me of mr robot idk y
that is one badass way to escape
Gaias Vault?!
Best vid yet happy b day
What are the numbers Mason!
When the doom music kicks in
i love blowing up like u :)
i love how he just gets hit while explaning the prison!
John 3:16-17 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23-For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9-That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10-For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
Time to do gias vault
Hiiilloooo!
Wana keep mythrodak trapped never keep redstone wiring
10:53 um yah you do you said it takes 5 mins to mine a piece of obby with ur fist so it would take them 5 minutes
She gets in Real prison : well its time to escape
Your a beast
Imagine "my war" playing as a soundtrack now.
I ask you for a minute of your time to help me fulfill my dream of being an artist for the short time I have left in life I have cancer and I am disabled without friends why I cannot leave my house because of the bullying that they do to me why I was not lucky enough to have a good physique but I love myself as I am because that was what I got blessings and God bless you all
10:27 My man is so smart 12:45 13:16
this guy is the Yoshie Shiratori but in minecraft
This is so well made
Try gaias vault next.
Remember guy who escaped Alcatraz?  Yeah...

Btec mister robot.
the "Checkmate"
Man fuck the video I’m in for the music lmao
🚫He said that the guards don't have pickaxes, but when Mythrodak uses the guard station equipter, and gets an enchanted Netherite Pickaxe🚫
Why are so many prisions named after Greek gods first poesidians vault then hades and now ares
Do you edit your own videos? It's skillfully AMAZING! Well done on the escape!
The music is scarier than prison and prisoner
The ending was so good
COULDNT  you just make a bed drop through a wall made of obby into an obsidian box where you drown so you can’t get out without dying first...
you r insane and unstoppable oooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
So cool
When are you escaping Gaia’s vault
Somebody but this guy in a bedrock block and see him ascape
sveensven made a new prison gias vualt
the likes are his iq level
I am sad for these guys. they made it and one Day one guy just escapes it and mąkę video to everyone  how to escape like it this prison was on A Global server everyone could escape
Damn this mission impossible choreography is def to attract a lot of people and it def earned my sub
you are so smart 200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 iq
Ur so damn good at editing
Escape the prison made for admins.
When the DOOM music hits different.
Still waiting on Gaia's vault. EDIT: It's next!
#12 on trending, let’s goooo
1.17 part 1 is on the 8th... prison builders will be waiting for the star moment to strike...
SHEEESH That Was Epik
jjkay03 grammer was not very good and did he say he killed Shiratori?
DOOM ETERNAL MUSIC YESEEYEYEYYYEYEEYEYEYSYEYEYSYEYSYS
seensven is scared now when he said "who's next" and then a screenshot of gaia's vault. :)
I love how he named his parrot "Shiratori" which is the name of a famous prison escape artist.
10:24 / 10:25 where did that netherite pickaxe come from? 🤔🤣😳
if mythrodak uses 10% of his brain:
Hey i like your wideo and what can i say
MY DUDE IS UNSTOPPABLE
Your videos are only getting better 😮
If there are no tools in the warden room then how did you get efficiency 5 pickaxe ????? And it was also not in your ender chest then where did it come from????
4:50 *when the doom music kicks in*
This is literally your best video so far… especially the blowing up part was insane!
Doom Eternal music was a good touch
Now what was that prison at the end?
So first , h o w
A little late but congrats on the 200k🎉😃
this dude is a mastermind
This is fake because how does he have full equipment in the ender chest if only you can access your chest
Okay I have a question. Where did you get that pickaxe at 10:26? Seems a little sus?
The gaurds need picks
HAPPY BIRTHDAY! also when you escape that other pretty sizable fortress behind u, u should put up a sign that says nerd
Dear mythodak, it feels like you are a one man army, you make the best camera shots, direct them better than anyone, and the editing is a threat to the greatest of the greatest editors, (or perhaps, not as YOU are the greatest editor) please keep doing this
You like Doom dont you!
You certainly know how to edit like jeez chill
This feels like a South Indian action thriller movie with that music
12:47 the checkmate is out of this world!
Pog myth any prison myth escapes
The 'checkmate' to epic explosion montage gave me shivers holy shit
All their precious time and resources wasted...
I like how the doom music started after he got captured
I have to say the doom music is absolutely amazing and it fits very well
With the right music and editing, this guy can be utterly terrifying
Checkmate!
When you beat area challenge: doom music bass boosted to blow up your eardrums. (Edit) is there a god known for escaping bc if so you are that god
He should try to break out with the gards there
Jesus
Checkmate indeed
2:22 - 2:23 if you pause at the right moment you can see a message saying "i'm saving them"
nice.
Mythrodak be like, Impossible prison more like easy
Next prison name suggestion: Prison of Eve or God's complex sounds badass
Best video
Dream is taking notes
How did he get a pickaxe?
I wanna see u escape irl prison
This video is so good, not only the escape, but the video design as well, well done, cant wait to see your next video
Have you heard of the movie "Escape Plan"? I felt like I was watching this.
Every guard gangsta till doom music kicks in
The soundtracks you use are absolutely perfect.
Biggest takeaway for me from all that is that Mythrodak must REALLY like Doom music. What a man of culture.
What did you get arrested for originally?
Huh.... I got some Mr. Robot vibes from this.
Everyone vibin till the DOOM music stops playing
I was here this legend will reach 10 millions subscribers
im a new subber i also love it so epic
The ending is 🔥
Prisons: exist Mythrodak: yeah free clout
Checkmate
great vid!
Happy Birthday Mythrodak
Checkmate  -Mythrodak 2021
Holy cow i remember when u where at 48k subs
Better than dream smp lore
Happy bday myhtrodak
Just saying, u did most of these without any mining fatigue, so it’s kinda false...
Bombing a prison made out of obby. Ok
Gaia's vault incoming!!!
V2 Escape When
the real question is how does he know where everything is
Now do Gaia’s Vault
Well that was a pretty damn epic video if you ask me
Ur smart i wish u vsn escape prison in dream smp
WHEN THE DOOM MUSIC KICKS IN
Tf
When he said check mate and that base drop with the doom music I got chills
doom music
My boy acting like he and maze runner
Most funny and epic video ever dude
not karen or anything but (Hm YOU WILL HAVE A MINE FAQTIFUE)
shirotori means "white bird" in Japanese :D
*Doom music starts playing*. The guards: 👀
Lol happy b day
These get better every time! Happy B-day as well!
bedrockydex is next
you could just not do crime as well
push big red button and number go higher and then mythrodak big happy :))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
Wow, I love the end
I know something inescapable. Bedrock box
That’s probably your best directing yet, I love to see these videos come out!
minecraft's most dangerous man
he tried way too hard to be edgy
When the doom musics starts
DAMN THIS VIDEO IS SO GOOOOOOOOOOOOD
Everytime I watch one of these prison video I feel like watching a movie
This escape was so badass
How did you get an effieciency 5 netheite pick, you said the guard station gave you no pickaxes...
Vault
I want to see mythrodak trap all of the people that traped him like jjkay and seensven and put them all in his own jail
theres a version in minecraft where you can obtain bedrock in pure survival so uuuuhhhhh    whens that gonna come
You all got to admit that the transition into the ad was smooth
Mythrodak is helping people perfect making prisons while simultaneously forcing them to go through every Greek god in turn  Now that’s skill
its so much better when he cant "smuggle" in items that always kinda ruined it
This is the coolest escape yet! Good job
Who else liked the video before watching it?
I love when he goes ‘Checkmate’
Whenever I see him upload I click
How did you get a pick
Happy Birthday 🎊🎂🎉🥳
I LOVE IT! and i saw The gaias valut picture later... „Who is next?”
13:04 R.I.P Mythrodak’s PC
I wish you could like multiple times because the DOOM Music is just too good
Amazing
MY EARSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
that end was insane🔥🔥🔥
Awesamdude & Dream: OK so we decided to make a good prison- Everyone: Emmmmm, there´s a small problem here and there, so *WE MUST BUILD A SUPERPRISON THAT´S BIGGER THEN RENDER DISTANCE AND NO ONE CAN ESCAPE*
5:19 couldnt you have given us headphone users a warning
"There aren´t traps that can´t be turn againts the trapper." -Grand admiral Thrawn, 1 after battle of Yavin (Star Wars)
mythrodak back at it again with another banger 😎
5:10
Number 21 on trending for gameing 21 hours ago perfect
I love how he just quickly explained a way he could escape super easily and was just like "that's boring".
THE QUALITY IS IMMACULATE
Happy birthday I am next with the prison my death's vault is almost done
Finally someone used the soundtrack l properly
Gosh I love the cinematics of this channel! BTW happy birthday, Mythrodak!
I betcha Percy Jackson would be good at escaping this prison
He is Yoshie Shiratori
Just love the checkmate :D
Just love the checkmate :D
anyone gonna mention how there's a giant prison-looking thing at the end?
Damn the whole video was so badass, found a way to break out in two ways 😲
wouldnt the guards break the obby with their picks?
If I were the guard and had seen the tnt, I would've placed the obsidian again and waited till I heard the blast, then break the obsidian blocks and run from the prison, hoping not to get caught by the warden, who would punish us for trying to run
Aye I just made a prison im kinda new at it maybe try and escape mine before gaias vault just a thought :))
People should make a parrot prison that he has to bust his boi out of
Me I’m next
Who else loves his editing
Fitting that the Ares Vault escape would have the DOOM soundtrack
The Doom Ost makes me want to escape every prison bare hands
GAH I MISSED THE PREMIERE WHILE I WAS *SLEEPING* also you're voices are SO BEAUTIFUL PRESENT FROM ABOVE WOOO
Sorry I missed the party but this is probably one of the best videos you uploaded so far
OMg big brain 10000 iq
Who else got chills at the end
Blown away at the production quality of these. Next level
What u need to escape next is impossible but if can record it escape the guardians vault
ngl the doom music makes this more badass
"Checkmate." The single most intimidating and awesome use of that word
A DOOM OST IN A MINECRAFT VIDEO?????????????? LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Doom sto is that you
idk if its just me but these sounds and stuff they kinda gave me chills:_:
This guy makes the coolest videos
You should do that vault by @SeenSven his latest vault
“Checkmate” mythrodak 2021
Imagine mythrodak building his own prison and trapping all the prison creators in it
And he says his video's aren't editing masterpieces.
This is one of the most intense Minecraft videos i've ever seen
The doom music is perfect!!!!
im counfused how you got a netherite pickaxe when you said the guards dont have any. 10:58
SAVE JOE BIDEN     lol
How tf  did you get a pickaxe?????
“I used the prison to destroy the prison”
Giea's vult confirmed?
“checkmate”  now THIS is gonna be the epic part.
this just went from making a better prison for dream to make an inescapable prison real fucking quick
Me watching these while doing iq test made me smarter lol 😂
Where did you get pickaxe?
*Checkmate*
How far are u into figuring out how to escape gaia's vault
i love the transitions
So no ones gonna talk about the prison he showed at the outro
I love the words "who's next" because that is just a warning to your unstoppable and unobtainable determination, i love these vids!
0:31 Nice
We know now Gaia’s vault is inescapable then lol
Lol I have the easiest to build, simplest prison and impossible to escape ever, just put the man in an obsidian box and every 5 seconds he gets killed with harming pots so he can’t mine the obsidian. BOOSH ITS DONE
Game plan today: Kill everyone
,
u know its intense when its playing the only thing they fear is you
Anyone else vibing to the doom?
Mythrodak woke up and chose violence.
it is my Birthday today :)
When the doom music kicks in
Just curious, where did you get the netherite pickaxe??
I love the way he talks and edits. It's like awesome!!!
You're not trapped in with the guards, The guards are trapped in with you
I love how he says really secure instead of inescapable
This video is so well put together, perfect music choice too
mythrodak is an avengers level villian by this point
less names with vault pls
try to design your own prison
Now do it but they have pickaxes
When you went into the guard equipping station there was a netherite pickaxe
This was EPIC!!
Since you’re getting out in prison so much why don’t you just set a enderpearl trap for yourself and turn it on with your alt at any time
2:19 HE SWORE :OOO
Dam that doom music fits 😎
How did he get that efficientcy 5 pick if they don’t get picks
5:10 badass
I mean this video is good n all, but how would you reasonably know that there’s that bit at the bottom of the prison..?
Man. What’s the point of building all these huge ass prisons if people will just keep escaping them. These must take so many hours
If I had to summarise this in just 3 words, I'd say:  R I P  A N D  T E A R
The storylines for these videos are getting really good
the music is so dramatic, I LOVE IT!
Everytime ⟟ feel like I’m in a movie when ⟟ watch your videos, they are so amazing
Myth: hoes next   Myth:😈
Its obsidian though you cant blow it up
“I’m going to have to take as many as I need” -Mythrodak
What's next? Jesus vault???
MY NAME IS ARES YESS also it's pronounced Aries not Ares:(
Mythrodak can u make a video on how to escape a real prison
Happy bday! :D
Dreamsmp Prison try escape
Wow! This looks and sounds like an epic action movie! :O
hbday
yo escape my prison I bet you can ****makes a 3x3 bedrock box****
Oh man finally someone who uses alot of doom ost
1:00 JJKAY03: starts talking with french accent Me: ono, its the french again!
i swear to go you saying check mat mythrodak gave me goose bumps with the doom music noice
At the end when he just says "checkmate" most epic thing ive ever seen
When the doom music kicks in
When the doom music went on I new this would be good
we need a movie of ALL of these prisons and the story. it would be better then any minecraft movie ever
The line CheckMate waa so insane
Bro I love how he used BFG division from doom
Videos are fake byt entertaining no i mean really it gets the kids going also the quality is good but every escape is pretty much the same the systems for prisons arent limitless so yeah
love the doom music oi should do a playthprough of doom eternal
Arises, that's how Aries is spelt
im next im still working on my prison its called satons vault all the releguios people about to kill me lol
What about Gaia’s vault?
Next Vid: Escaping Zeus's Vault without moving B)
when stealth is an option mythrodak:
Lol 4:32 part was just for humiliation
what next? zeus's vault?
Jesus this is so well edited this man bout to blow up that was awesome 👏 good job dude
I’m lucky I don’t have the time (and the will) to create a prison     You scary
13:24 FORESHADOWING
Checkmate.
dang this was good
12:47 checkmate? more like uno reverse card
every vault is going to be named after a Greek god.
This has to be your best video yet. The angles of the camera the music everything was perfect
Damn bro that was Brutal
u r way to freaking smart!!!!
Escaping with style
Have you tried rayworks prison
"Hey dinners ready." "Shhh, Im watching a movie"
*i have a very bad feeling about that prison he looked at*
ok
the “whose next” got me chills man, ALSO HBD! I love ur content :)
I thought i was subed but idk why i wasnt
This dude is the John Wick of vault escaping
Spoiler alert for Gaia’s vault maybe???
Whats next The candice vault
The doom intro to escaping the prison is me gearing up in conan exiles
Good escape and all but you gotta remember the people that get tped using the stasis chamber might have pickaxes and would most likely be outside waiting
That doom music drop hit so so so hard I love this video
I have a good prison for him it is a full bedrock cage with no windows and all covered with layers of bedrock
Did you make a copy of the world that had the prison in it so that the prison was not actually destroyed
I wish u good luck for gaias vault im sure u can escape it btw
Eventually there gonna run outta Greek gods to name these things after
Omg 20th trending
Way to break out then insult the builder by trampling their work
Seensven: gaia's vault the perfect priso-  Mythrodak: checkmate
When the DOOM music kicks in.
Ill try to make a prison but i dont have minecraft :(
The video editing keeps geting better and better each video
Sorry for the hate, but these types of videos are so shit
Sheeeeeeeeeesh
THIS MAN HAS DESTROYED SO MANY WORK FORCES
Are you ok mythrodak you sound like you haven’t slept for a while
Why not use the bedrock at the bottom of the world to trap them?
THE DOOM MUSIC 😩
DOOOOOOOM
The doom theme hits really good  Happy birthday btw
The doom music made the video 1000x better
Pog
10:19 HOW DID HE GET A PICKAXE?????????? this seems a bit sus since he said that you cant get a pickaxe from the guard chambers.
im just going to say this was so much more intence then it needed to be XD
4:52 - 5:30 most awsome moment in the escape
this is like a movie
This is the stuff I subbed for 🥲
13:17 Giga's Vault
Mythrodak: *Checkmate*  Guard 3: Why do i hear boss music?
4:59 doom music kicks in
"Checkmate" *Doom music kicks in*
Why spending hours into building a cool looking prison when you could trap people into bedrock ._.
Pristine content ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL
Mythro your editor is so good
My Prison Is IMPOSSIBLE To Escape The Materials Are Just 30 Bedrock...
10:10  if that was me:  wow free stuff wow **get in there** **get out** **get in there again for free stuff** and repeat
Every safety defense in the prison started crying when he said "checkmate"
Mythrodraks choice of music is literally doom eternal osts
'When the doom music kicks in.'
Mythrodak you should escape a bedrock edition prison
Gias vault is not check matted check made it
Happy birthday!
Mythrodak in dreamsmp when
Happy Birthday!
This is a fucking movie omg i love your videos so much

Today my birthday
The same guy made an inescapable prison called the kingstone
It would be impossible with mining fatuige becuse you wouldent be able to break the redstone without it becoming night and the guard entering
Wtf @MytrodakTV you magically at 10:29 you got a netherite pick explain yourself sir 🤨
Really liking the Greek mythology huh
next kartos vault
dude you said they guards dont have pickaxes but how did you get one from the dispensres
Me not having you on all notifications is a mistake I won’t make twice
Pog

ONE OF THE BEST MINECRAFT SERIE EVER MADE.
Happy bday
Chess be like: checkmate
This was the best made video I have ever seen
Ah so macgyver but minecraft. Cool.
THE VIDEO IS SO GOOD but where did you get the pic? You said that the equipment chamber didn’t give pics. I don’t think it really would have been too much of a difference though
MythrodakTV dude THE INTRO IS SO PERFECT U PUSH BIG RED BUTTON NUMBERS GO UP AND MythrodakTV happy XD (Pls make that the intro every VIDEO! thanks!)
Happy bday also I love your edits there so cool my fav is the end

Your videos are more dramatic than the james bind movies
the tnt just made the thing hollow its obsidian but epic
Even if you put him in a bedrock box he will still escape
Happy b-day! Btw, around here, 11:00 where did you get the pickaxe because you said before the guards don’t have them?
Whatever comes trough that prison, you will stand your ground! *Mythrodak comes out" RUN!!!
2:23 IM SAVING THEM
The music gets better every time. They remembered the most important rule... never let him get preparation time
Happy birthday! and a question, when you gonna break out of gias vault?
4:32 he flexed on Ares's Vault with mining fatigue 3
The next prison almost impossible just remember that.
What did mythrodak do, he always get stuck in a prisons, and he always escapes from all prisons.
Literally god
that last part where he blows up the whole thing freaking blew up my mind
honestly CHECKMATE is the scaryest thing he says
Yo Doom eternal soundtrack litty

Mythrodak coolest guy alive? I think yes
I fucking love these videos. They just get better and better everytime :D the storyline and editing is amazing :)

HELL YEAH
When the doom music kick in
Hurry up and add him to dsmp
Congrats on 200k subs

That checkmate gave me goosebumps
Bro the end is incredible
I bet you can't even escape an bedrock cage XD
*Checkmate*
just realized that ur hit 200k subs congrats i guess
Happy bday!
1000 IQ play Mae a ended pearl chamber powered by a daylight detector and at night you’ve escaped and nothing can stop u
How can you make some squares look so intense
Who's else thinks mythrodak would be good for lore
THEY SAID IT COULD NOT BE DONE
5:05 when the doom music kicks in
Yoshia shiratori
Resident evil prison edition [rated PG]
the doom music is fucking lit
THIS IS EPIC. It's like a drama which is minecraft!
honestly these videos are made like actual movies
When the doom music kicks in :
This is like a movie
boi the prisoner has escaped again
This guy talks about escaping prison like light from deathnote, its amazing have a good birthday
THAT WAS AMAZING!
recently got into heavy metal, always appreciate some doom eternal ost.
Waiting for the escaping gaias vault
You truly are an editing master.
ESCAPE THE OPERATOR VAULT PLS AND YOU CAN USE OP AND CREATIVE
Just waiting for a Netflix series. '-'
Boah this was epic
THIS IS SO F*CKING APPROVED
Cool doom music
Am I the only person that got goosebumps when he said "checkmate"?
O i love this video
Wow mythrodak is a master escapist and editor this vid was epic
So, Gaia’s vault. Uh. Ye
scicraft got bedrock in survival escape that. and happy bday
I think they need bows
me thinking wouldn't it be cool if there was doom music
Is it me or does every prison have the word VAULT in and a gods name idk 🤨
Everyone also gangsta until they realize that Mythrodak showed how to beat the prison
The Doom music was... HMMMMMMMMMPH HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM   yes.
Ya know that they keep making these prisons but they can just put him in the void
Our King is back.
wow!
Everyone gangsta until JJKAY03 and starpinox build another prison
You’d think that by this point Mythrodak would be a little better at evading capture.
Imagine if mythrodak went into the dream smp,he could be among the best characters
LoL use creative
GAIA'A VAULT NEXT HOLY SHIT
bro, i came up with the best idea to try to stop u, but i need to start building it.
Still waiting for the bedrock box
This was so entertaining
Am I the only one who thought he was gonna end it with a meme and leave a sign saying 'Get rick rolled lol outside the prison entrance
Mythrodak:The guards don't have pickaxes! Also Mythrodak:steals a pickaxe from guards at 10:26
Vidoe idea: Surviving 100 in a Minecraft Prison heheh
This series has better character development then Netflix
pog  pog pog pog pog pog pog pog pog poggggggg
How is diz guy Not On the DSMP
i hope u get on the dsmp. U deserve it lol
Is it just me or is this videos editing increased than most of his other vids keep up with the great work
ares is also a hacked client
That was Fuggin epic
THEY COULD'VE CALLED IT ATHENA'S VAULT IT'S LITERALLY A MONUMENT TO HER IN ATHENS, A CITY NAMED AFTER HER
They should have put a floor with obsidian and water instead of the pit that would kill you at fall!!
This was by far my favorite escape yet.
Hi
Lol tnt vs obsidian
yr content is sooo  amazing                 also pls escape gaias vault
When the doom music kicked in
How to make an unescapable prison: Bedrock prison In the nether Spawnpoint of the prison: In the overworld in a bedrock....thing
dang this is a masterpiece for prison escape
How can one be so awesome
Next is... Gaias Voult by SeenSven, and I have a nother one, and its called Kings Stone :D
Ares is the God of War      God Of War Players: wat
The outside of the prison kind a looks like a museum
i love your video style i hope i see more of this (you just earned a subscriber)
12:45   Checkmate
This guy makes Albert Einstein look dumb
If you were invited to Dream SMP i think that you are going to be haunt by AsewomeDude every second
Mom : 'what are you watching?' Me : 'Minecraft prison escape Movie.'
1:00 is that guy Swedish
And yet another masterpiece… Just WOW!
Wy was this so intense, I love the whole theatrical feel to it, incredible job
It's a fucking movie
There are only so many greek dieties; they won't have enough prisons to contain him
epic word: "checkmate"
I love how he used Doom Eternal's Soundtrack.... *THIS MAKES THE VIDEO A LOT MORE BADDASS*
GAIA? wow you are a maniac.
I subbed because its your birthday!
"checkmate." that was so perfect
I can make you a prison, bedrock box!! (you can glitch bedrock into your inv in vanilla survival.)
join the dream smp
Who cares about the dream smp? Mythrodak prison lore is where its at
Music at the end is just epic it goes well with the tnt blowing up
i need this on nexflix, wait i dont even have it
When doom music kicks in.
They need to hire this guy to write for Escape Plan 4
Are all minecraft prisons canonically built down the street from each other or something?
Gaciers vault
HAPPY BIRTHDAY! LOVE UR AMAZING VIDS UR BIGGER BRAIN THAN DREAM NGL
2030: I escaped Alcatraz in IRL 2050: I escaped the event horizon of a black hole
dude just to the guardian's vault or something like that.
Next video gias valt escaped the
I like ya cut g
2:19 it sounds like the f word for some reason
anyone wonder what he did to get in all these prisons
@SeenSven you are next
im gonna try to do this on hardcore
minecraft prisons in 2012: some iron bars, iron doors and stone, can be escaped trough the toilet  minecraft prisons now: deadly obsidian boxes with lots of redstone, escaping is overcomplicated
0:36 gave me nightmares lmao and btw happy birthday
Checkmate
this was actually so sick
I think the doom OST carried This whole video 🔥 Doom Lovers :)
Can you do guardians vault
Did everybody repeated the ending?
when the doom music kicks in
10:23 a pickaxe appeared from nowwhere
But from where did you get the pickaxe while you said that the armor station only gives armor and weapondls but not tooles
This is the best use of doom music!
*t-poses* where Gaia vault
wait they even gave u a few stacks of notch apples
play with actual guards maybe cause you rely to heavily on the guards not thinking
machine gun vault go brrrrrrrr
Have you tried Gaia’s Vault?
Theses videos are edited incredibly props man good job! Happy birthday btw.
Hey
Okay but like, what did you do to be put into all these prisons?
happy birthday bro. Your cinematics of all of your videos are too fucking sick bro
This is SOOOOO epic at the end when the gurd mines a block of obsidian and sees the tnt "Checkmate" BRO
what crimes did you commit tho
Wait sad they make it takes a long time
when is gias vault coming out
We are witnessing the birth of a legend
GAIA'S VAULT NEXT!!!!
When The DOOM Music kicks in: (Ngl the DOOM Music fits perfectly here)
Happy birthday
Mythrodak was like 😎 to 😄
The doom music makes it so much better
2:18 "frocked"
If you can escape every prison why dont you and seensven make a true inescapeble prison
this was badass.
he always makes it so cool
I love how he casually said how to escape by breaking the bed without even thinking
This guys is isane
This kinda gimme karlson vibe
Doom Soundtrack was good
the ending its... so  good
this won't work you set your spawn in the cell so you won't spawn in the room with the redstone area you would spawn in the cell @MythrodakTV
A original YouTuber rare
I CHALLENGER NEW APPROCHES 13:16
Happy birthday also crazy plot twist
hey you should try escaping bankers vault(probably more unescapable)
I taught this was supposed to be the "impossible" prison
Why don't you try to make your own prison?
DAMN. I LOVE HOW THEY ARE ALL FILMED LIKE A MOVIE OR SMT
*doom music kicks in* WAR
12:28 Boom!? Yes kowalski, boom!!
5:10 Song??
HBD
Please escape guardian vault
How he can be capured and never get out trap him un bedrock without anu room to move
I just can't stop watching these videos
Minecraft logic : tnt can't destroy netherite. But instead blows and kills someone wearing netherite armor.
I think we can all agree that this was the most badass escape yet
Happy birthday  MYthrodaktv
the music go brr
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THAT WAS SICKKKKK
Nice video
"WHO CALLED IT! I CALLED IT!" xDDDD  last episode i called half of this plot... WOO HOO I CALLED IT LES GOOOOO WOOO!!!
Normal people: WOOHOO I ESCAPED Mythrodak: Did u blow up the prison like I did? Normal people: what.....?  Mythrodak just killed the prison not escape it
When are you gonna escape giga ' s vault
"Checkmate"
Happy birthday mythodrak
Im pretty sure Mythrodak is one of the new minecraft generations that will rise the minecraft community greater than its golden age
your editing is dope
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!
Happy birthday!
Hey someone copied my prison
12:46 O...O
finnaly u escaping gias vault
Happy birthday my dude :)
How did I get like 20 chills in 13 minutes??? That editing, that storytelling and the music just perfectly add up to a great Video!
I'm seeing his video for the first time the way he told to subscribe was good so I did
gias vult pog
Nobody talking about the doom ost at around 5 minutes
Fun fact:you can break bedrock with 4,500,000 tnt.
If the next prison is just called vault I won't be surprised
5.10: DOOM MUSIC INTENSIFIES......
This is the most badass thing I’ve ever seen
7:53 i thought he was going to say “and with those stics,i can make absolutely nothing”
Holy shit the ending was perfect, the music, the cinematics, everything fit the tone to a point. Loved it :D
bro u literally said how to escape his prison in 5 seconds
The dislikes are idiots
this has gotta be one of the coolest minecraft videos ever made holy shit
What crime did you commit
Why does the doom music fit so well?
YOOOOOOO! Your cinematography was always good, but dang it's so beautiful to see you still grow it more and more! :D
All you need to do to make a inescapable prison cell is to make a small bedrock room with no door or holes, then teleport your victim to the cell.
when the doom music hits
IM NEXT im building a prison called: GigantAmethyst's vault (one problem u cant play it it is bedrock edition)
Fun fact TNT don't blow up obsidian and water could save some of the important things but overall this was great
hmm if I'm a God at making redstone doors and actually having minecraft I would make something like this, the unholy temple, exactly what it says         also, prison Idea, the unholy temple btw this idea is my gift for your idea
happy birthday!
if you need to catch the hunter, you need to become hunter! xD
these videos are cinematic as hell
He’s like the lockpickinglawyer for Minecraft prisons
Nobody is talking about how he got a netherite pickaxe outta nowhere
Fucking Legend
the production is great 👍
*10 years later* aight guys this series is over as the devs kinda ran out of gods :/
you're getting very creative with these things...keep it up
Love the editing so much
I love the "*CHECKMATE*" part. It gives me goosebumps. You've earnt a sub. :D
Happy birthday dude but I have a question in the part where you were given the guard Armour you were also given a pickaxe So if the guards were given the same thing then why didn't they have pickaxes
This is so insanly cool.
"once i break 3 redstone" rofl
Didn't know doomguy had a son...
OMG THAT WAS EPIC
Best. Video. Ever.

The doom soundtrack does hit hard man
He cheated! If you check 10:18-10:28 a pickaxe appeared in his inventory despite the fact that the guard equip stations don't give you one!
Mythrodak: Ares was the god of war.....  Me who knows kratos is actually the god of war: I don't know about that
13:15   I am scared...      very very much 😓
I don't think he understands how birthday gifts work
200k poggers
I love how he makes bombing the place so dramatic
birthday arson
JJkay03: I could've placed elder gardians.  Mythrodak: But ya didn't.
Its great how he shows how to break out in a super easy 5 second montage
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MYTHRODAK

Happy birthday Mythrodak also will you consider to escape my prison I am close to finish it it is soo good...
A prison *exists*  Mythrodak: Are you challenging me?
Soon they're gonna run out of Olympians to name vaults after
Now we just wait till he escape Gardians vault V 2
so they prisoned him at his birthday. *that's a not-so happy birthday*
The editing, the music, the script, the smart escape plan... that was an amazing video. Truly well played to everyone involved.
15 hours ago, hmmm
Some one give this man a medal
That whole escape was great! Locking the guards and blowing up the prison woo! That checkmate gave me persona flashbacks too. Also happy birthday mythro!
Congratulations with the 200k!
DOOM ETERNAL song kicks of me:     >:)
Tomorrow is my birthday
YES FINNALLY GAIAS VAULT WILL SOON BE ESCAPED
I like the doom music
His vedios are awesome . The editting and etc are so cool
me builds a glitchy teleport machine before im in the prison
Imagine him escaping a real prison
Mythrodak eating prisons for breakfast every single time lol
Holy fk ur intros are cool
Shit The TNT edit was SICk
It should be called athenas vault cos it looks like the parthenon temple
Next is gaia let's go
How you got netherite pickaxe?
This guy.. ._.  ....he good...am just chicken nugget eater
4:52 *_when the doom music kicks in_*
pog 200k subs
him who's next looks at gaias vault me:ohh shiiiiiiit
you know its good day when mythro uploads AND its his birth day. 2 birds in one stone happy b day :DD
You'd be perfect for the Dream SMP
I heard doom music and came running over.
I read it as "arse vault" first time lol
mythrodak: i mastered to escape all prisions me (trapped in a vault with 10 guards near me):i m never gonna get out
This was like a movie what a great vedio man
If i were to make a prison ill make a cage 100 layers of obby u cant die since *its just a cage* plus the guards can see the prisoner by using the "composter glitch"
Hey I can make an inescapable prison        Tiny obsidian box filled with water and a elder guardian on the top (away from the conduit) and 5 kill checks in another box and no bed cus ur never gonna die. *Simple*  Also the guard has the best armor and god apples
I love the new editing style
that. was. epic
unbelievable that he can escape so easily                   epic
the doom music made the video 69000000 times better
my birthday is a day before mythrodaks
These people will run out of Greek Gods before he stops escaping the prisons.
Happy birthday and you should try the guardians vault
So you escape things what are not meant to wow
The best one yet
hi mythrodak i just wanted to say happy birthday
12:46  Checkmate 🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥  This gave me the chills
Happy birthday Myth! Also I noticed you named your bird Shiratori? Like prison magician? Nice reference.
how do you get the pickaxe if none of the dispensers gave them?
Congrats on 200k
When the doom music kicks in
Can you escape bankers valt
HAPPY BERTH DAY to you happy berth day to you happy birthday and wish
The only thing they fear is...    Mythrodak
THAT USE OF BFG DIVISION
make most non-euclidean prison  immersive portals and pehkui mods + ares vault
More like a film
How did you know what block to break at the bottom of the pit in the chamber and how the guards got no pickaxe how did you get one when there was not one in your ender chest
What is the next prison. I saw a bit of it at the endddd. Pls hurry up and get trapped in there😂😂😂😂🤣
In your hotbar, you had a netherite pickaxe, but you said the guards didn't get them in the armor station??
That was awesome!!!
You know when the doom music starts playing the prison has to escape Mythrodak
Where did you get the netherite pickaxe from
ay congrats on 200 k :D
Doom eternal music
The Doom music makes everything 10 times more epic, great video, epic as hell, keep goin Mythrodak!     Happy Birthday

Happy birthday!
Happy Birthday!
Mythrodak sees a string in a cell: this is all i need
Omg you hit 200k and when you post the video you have like 150k:))
Try eascaping bankers vault 🙂🙂
Every Prison in minecraft has to be named after a Greek God
Best prison escaper 2021
Congrats on 200k Subs 🎉🎉
also if the gaurds did get killed by the tnt they would then end up stuck in the prison!
Me: mom can we have ranboo  Mom: no we have ranboo at home  Ranboo at home:

**sweats in FBI**
Enjoy your birthday with lots of prisons and vaults. 😀
POV: you are here to find question and correction comments
Your so dramatic I like it
This video was truly fantastic
when u gonna escape gaia's vault, I hope I spelled her right
That prison at the end though...  *The fun is just getting started isn't it?*
Free netherite !
Why do people have to call it vault after Pandora’s vault. It’s really annoying
that is very nice quality and happy birthday!
Omg its my bday aswell!
Gaia’s Vault is next
this is mr robot in minecraft.
Somebody stop this man, but then again don't, I LOVE THE MUSIC!
Who knew you could make minecraft look so badass

Checkmate
Yes
10:37 amazing bet you felt proud of that during editing
Man you always outdo your self, happy bday
Nice ending song
This was the coolest thing ever
I have my own type of prison actually All you need to do is have the prison above the nether roof in the air and build a box to the build limit with a respawn anchor that recharges everytime And the floor outside the box is lava
You got the 200k
4:52 when the Doom music kicks in
Now this is cool
Yoo this almost felt like I am watching a movie

this is by far the most epic one
Dude your editing is fire!
YO, I THINK I WAS HIS 200K SUB WHAT
200k Yessss
Holy cow that production value doe
The way you spoke in the beginning of the video... The thought overlapping on top of a conversation. The constant anxiety driven thought... Reminds me of only one show: Mr. Robot.
This is the samrtest person I've ever seen.
there are so many prisons now, we gonna run out of greek gods
this is such an incredible masterpiece sheeesh!!!
Mythrodak: Commands are banned in the making of the prisons, because we can't get it in a normal vanilla Minecraft. Also Mythrodak: /spawnpoint
yooo i have the power to change subscribe button to 200 k
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

*"When the doom music kicks in"*
Doom music
Good job in getting to almost 200k
What about Gaia’s Vault?
Did Mythrodak really just pull a Tai Lung? Oh wait... he's been doing that ever since.
I wonder what builders are gonna do when they run out of Olympians
Mythrodak is simultaneously helping people slowly perfect Minecraft prisons while forcing them to go through all of the Greek gods
Thx

i have made a small but really hard to escape fan prison with the create mod for minecraft forge 1.14.4 to 1.16.5
Happy birthday
Almost 200k pog :)
Happy b day
Mythrodaks vids have just kept on getting better ever since i started watching
on 10:16 u never had a pick  how did u get 1
If he had no prior knowledge to the layout of the vault, except from when he was being brought inside, he could not have done this, or at least not done with with a *lot* of luck. Victory by plot armor, via a very convenient ender chest and knowledge of "break this block." Oh, also, that netherite pickaxe came out of nowhere.  Nice video, but you're better than this.
Ur birthday present is gonna be 200k subs. Congrats.
BFG DIVISION GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Hey my dad is in North Korea prison, can  you teach him how to escape like you?
me: how tf do i get out him: easy, lemme make it tougher for me
Escape gaia's vault
Excellent choice in soundtrack
Ur music choice impressed me every time
12:47 This is so freaking cool
Bro I think your the first channel I’ve watched where I subscribed only halfway through the video, This was insane! >:D
Mom said it’s my turn to be pinned.
This man can literally escape a 3X3 bedrock wall.
One thing before considering making a prison do not put resources for him to get
Happy Birthday!!
POG
i got twice ear raped, man, TWICE, one being the blaring noise , and other music
The only prison he cant escape is just a bedrock chamber he cant move he cant breack nor cant he smuggle any itmes cuz they will use a bed to glitch him in there
13:21 I was thinking about that literally 1 sec ago THE ****** VAULT!
I was waiting for Gaia's vault. Please post it fast.
Yo some dude is selling a better prison called Medusa’s vault
It's so drematic boi I love this
at least Shiratori is safe
Challenge- Try to escape any of the prisons made by seensven
Awesome video, keep up the good work
Happy Birthday prisoner escapee, bane of law
Can I just say this With how good mythrodak has gotten at escaping these prisons I wouldn’t be suprised if he could it in real life
12:45 this shit gave me goosebumps man!
This is a thousand times better than Netflix.
“Checkmate” -mythrodak
I like how you added doom music
If i build a prison i would do everything accept the redstone ore and replace it with the one like in Titan's vault
Where did he get a pickaxe from? I thought that the equipment stations don't give pickaxes
OH MY GOD THAT DOOM SONG JUST KILLED MY EARS WHAT THE HELL  p.s. happy bday
Is there no copyright on Doom music?
Why is this video epic than dream smp lore how  Happy birthday 🎂 mythrodak i think I am late
So its a Bad run
this is probably the best video you have ever uploaded
u r geni
also update 1.17 is close too
Were did he get that pickaxe
happy birth day man
I hope one day you will be recruted as a new member to the dream smp👑
No offense to your videos or your work but at first when I saw your video I expected you to like, idk, go in bare fists (which you did) and not know anything but only what you saw and adapt to it, I didn't you to actually study the prison, because ngl that kinda killed the magic for me, I expected something like el chapo.
Less goooo!!!😆 gaias vault, her we come!!^^
Happy birthday Mythrodak
try escape bankers vault
Damn prison builders gotta just quit
hbd mythro :)
4:26 *doom*
Happy birthday mythrodak I love your channel
This ending absolutely fits the doom music.. Best one so far
I want this guy to be added to the Dream SMP and end up helping Dream and all, with your announcement skills, you are gonna be able to make a really cool video to tell people you're joining the SMP.
Happy birthday! :)
Kinda sad that these take months to make and and it takes less than a few minutes to destroy it all
Ha ha listen to your ears
bruh editing ssoooo godly
Happy birthday the goddes of escapes MYTHRODAK: This man will be unstópbale in dream smp for if be evil he can break out dream and if they inprison him he escape the next day instantly and people stop making any orisone this guy escape every thing with no cheating
Happy birthday
Wanted Level: 7 Stars
you never cease to amaze me
Normal people on their b-day-I got a gift! Mythrodak on his b-day- Well...so basically I escaped an inescapable prison!
BRO WHY IS 10:45 FUNNY TO ME
The doom music is very fitting and I love the part when the guard got blown to pieces as the music makes it seems like the guard was screaming
Best movie of 2021
13:18 Myth: who's next (turns towards gaias vault) Me : yeah let's goooo
13:16 this gonna be awsome
Try breaking into Gaia's Vault. 😏
Escape Gaia's vault
Mythrodak didn't you say that the guards didn't pickaxes only armour, gapples, and weapons but when you got the guard armour you got a pickaxe?
You are a master at escaping prisons, but apparently really bad at not getting captured.
This guy's videos are so well edited and well made keep it up my g
Sure ill subscribe :)
Happy birthday
4:33:  The creator of the prison br like: the wat
Happy birthday, this is a sick video!
MythrodakTV can escape every prison exer existed in minecraft
Techno would be proud.
Imagine if there was that one bomb who didnt go out at all
Also Happy Birthday bro
MAN, this guy can escape from literal Alcatraz if he wanted to
When the doom music kicks in
damn, most videos you just escape but you take advantage of the guard items and everything in this, you TRAP THE GUARDS, good job, wow
I like how he uses Doom eternal music in this video🤣
Just wait till they start making prisons in the nether. Itll be much harder cause no beds
P
Mythrodak op
Do guardians cuald
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MYTHRO!!!!!!!!
The quality of these videos are absolutely incredible well done man :)
escape the mother of all vaults gaias vault
I was already subscribed but I accidentally unsubscribed lol
Mythodrak. Now escape the version with slowness. And make it execution day, All the guards will be watching u. U will be brought to an execution room. (can be built offsite) and u start inside the prison. If u do this. Good luck.
THIS IS ON ANOTHER LEVEL
Nice
10:35 savage lmao
I will build mine one day after I am good at redstone
Happy birthday
DOOM MOMENT
MythrodakTV : *exist*  Every prison : I use to rule the world
Happy Birday Mythoradk!
man your videos are soo goood
The doom music made the video poggers nice choice of music
Use a hacked client to kill the skulker with kill aura in gigas vault
This is the equivalent to killing every person in the map except the targets in hitman and walking after them as they try to call for help and run away
Hi
I love your content you take a cool subject and add lore
Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown
5:28 the theme 😂😂
Happy birthday
Not as deadly as Gaia’s vault
I am mythrodaks 1 k fam i subbed him when he had one k subs
His cinematography is the best part aside of his  ingenuity! Happy Birthay Mythrodak!
5:10 doom music kicks in
sveen bee like ohh fuck i have no clout anymore
Happy Birthday brooo!!!!
Happy Birthday Myth
The doom music fits with this so well. Happy birthday
Love lovelove love love love love love love love love love love love,  I couldn't keep going, your content
IDK how but in each new video the editing is getting better and better
The problem is that he plays wuth his friebds
Today is my birthday too!
Happy birthday you escape artist
Mythodak if the prison builder removed the 2 pieces of planks their?
Happy bday
I must say this is insane!!
Imagine not being subbed
Now escape an 1×1 Bedrock Cube. Best prison yet
Yeet
Ok so no jail can possibly hold this dude
- and after all, i filled everything with tnt and ignited it.   *guards leave the game because they know it's too late to stop you*  *You go back to portal to see, how the prison looks inside after the explosions*  *TNT which was waiting for you in unloaded chunks explodes and breaks the portal*  *Other tnt explodes, kills you and removes all your items*  *you respawn in a broken bed trap in an obsidian pocket, then die from tnt and respawn again*  *you go back to the portal room to see that you lost your flint and steel and are completely stuck in this prison again*
Dream smash? Nah, Mythrodak lore.
This is better than Netflix     Change my mind
Happy *fucking BIRTHDAYYYY*
Was it just me who watched it 5 times?
Happy Birthday!
This is the most epic vid
ngl this is like a movie i would watch this all day
YOOOOOO, the blowing up the prison part was EPIC!!!
WAIT, at 6:37 you said the guards have no pickaxes but at 10:26 there is an enchanted netherite pickaxe in your 3rd hotbar slot, and you even use it to mine a few blocks later in the video!! Is this why you cut off half of the screen where your hotbar is?!
Not only does he take the time to figure out escape plans but he makes it as badass as possible and on top of that the quality of the video and editing is phenomenal. Man deserves way more subscribers
The most epic escape on your birthday the cinematic scenes of EPIC legendary awesome
SeenSven be like:Nah I'm out of here
Somebody's been watching Mr. Robot lately
Happy birthday
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!! 🎁🎁🎁
I’ve got a challenge: Break out of a minecraft prison with only knowledge that can be gained from the inside of the cell and your path. Therefore, you can’t exploit parts of the prison about the blueprints. Basically rendering a large portion of escapes useless. Or you can’t do that?
I want Sad-ist to do an animation of some mythrodak prison escapes
wait for you to get trapped in prison irl
waiting for 16th june
after 10 days we will get the new video
happy birthday!!
So that's why room music was playing
The biggest mistake was ender chest
profiting from a prison. cool.
Chills fucking chills
i think this was the most EPIC escape you have made so far, and happy birthday! (if it still is your b-day)
the doom music made it so much better lmao
Here's a 🍪 happy birthday mythrodak
Do anyone know what is the meaning of his name. Anyway Luv Ur Videos❤️
The quality of your videos has gone up by so much. You deserve literally all the support you get, I freaking love your videos so much.
when the doom music starts playing
Happy birthday Mythrodak
Gaia’s Vault : u can’t defeat me Mythrodak : I know , but he can  /gamemode creative
Now that was fucking epic.
I love the name Shiratori it’s like an easter egg to that one Japanese guy who escaped prison with miso soup.
HAPPY BIRTH DAY MYTHORDAK 😁🎂🎂🍪🍰
When  will you escaoe gai's vault
Okay, kinda want to know what he did to piss off literally every prison warden in the world. EDIT: just saw the end, now i know.
Why do I hear Doom Music.
Happy Birthday !
The doom music just made this even better
Happy Birthday
damn i got gousebumps watching the end
you deserve more creadit ima sub becasue yourve convinsed me
more
Doom eternal music was such a good choice, also fullbright is a thing which would let the guards see you when your in the pit, but your a god gamer so that probaly would even help em (if you say fullbright is a mod so its not allowed, in the settings for minecraft within app data you can change brightness above the in game cap to something like 1000 and yeah)
That ending was amazing.
And right before I left I ignited it.....................Checkmate
*Doom enternal music plays*
The tnt was the most badass thing ever
I love how there’s lore
"you're the last one, complete the mission"
You don’t see the strengths of a prison you don’t see just the bars you see opportunities and weakneses -ray breslin escape plan 1/2/3/4
I subbed
I cant wait when he escapes gaia vault
IT'S EPICCCCCC, I really love the song of doom, but listening to it and seeing how you turn the whole situation and the escape around is really mind-blowing. I loved the video, the edition and the explanation too. Mainly that you have done a simple method of escaping if you had fatigue 3 which is what everyone normally puts in their prisons. Ahh and I wanted to wish you a very very happy birthday and I hope it goes well for you and we continue to watch your videos, sporadically glad my quarantine: D
I think Mythrodak is had enought
Gaias vault
Awesamdude: *”WRITE THAT DOWN, WRITE THAT DOWN!!”*
Sheesh
next is gaia vault or vault 36
Happy Birthday Mythrodak! Can you escape Gaia’s vault without the command blocks on?
Happy bday
Happy b'day
do you have a new pc? it looks like tho pov parts have better fps
I love that there is doom music when he starts to escape
Lol love the cinematic when he blew it up
Plot twist: mythrodak was found not guilty shortly before he escaped the first prison but now that he escaped and was on the run he became a criminal which is why he has to escape so many prisons.  If we are talkin story, that is.
1. he made it harder for himself 2. he blew everything up and killed the gaurds and left with full gear 3 he did this as a birthday present
Please do Gigas vault 😁(impossible)
I like to imagine all of the prisons are just like a neighborhood, with a tiny picket fence between each of them
This is so good 😭😭
Mythrodak you can do athena's voult and i wanna Ask In your opinion Kingstone is better then gias voult
These are the type of you tubers who deserve the TOP spot
Where did he get the netherite pickaxe? 10:16  He has none in his enderchest and he said before that guards don't get any.
You have such good editors or you edit godly!!!!
Damn this guys monologues are great and content too
Dude this guys content is amazing and what makes it even better it’s his monologues and edits and soundtracks I ain’t a bot or working for him but really his content is great sub to him it will make him happy I know you love his content I do to
Happy birthday mythrodak :D I subbed
Dude could you be even more edgy thx
Mythrodak escape Gaia’s vault please
Next video: Escaping the Largest Prison (universe) and Breaking Back in (ft. God)
Happy birthday @MythrodakTV I hope you have an amazing birthday I love your videos and always get excited seeing you upload a new video I love the plot it’s genius and I can’t wait for future videos
I think the prison was more big than dream smp prison.
Happy birthday my favorite YouTuber!!!!!! Love the vid
Happy birthday to you 😁
I said it all of the vault videos in other youtubers mytrodak can escape in every prison
Happy birthday to you 😁
doom music intensify*, also happy birthday Mythrodak!
Check mate
When you pulled out the doom music, I already knew it was gonna be good.
I loved the ending
Bro! Happy Birthday my man! Great video as always, can't wait for your next video whether it be a prison or not! :D   I was going to comment this on your pinned comment, but YT was being weird.
Happy birthday
why is the lore on these videos more interesting than the entire dream smp
Bruh
people are gonna talk about Mythrodak the prison master
Happy birthday
DAYYYYYYYYYUMM U GAVE ME LE CHIILLLLLLLLLLSSS
yooo you upgraded from 720p to 1080p60!
Next Gaia vault
LETS GOOOOOOOOO!!!
Your production quality is sick man
Mythrodak videos are getting more and more dramatic. Wow!
Happy birthday Mythrodak
i was also gonna make this prison but u finished it already i have the same design idea
Dude try king stone
They could just make a small chamber filled with lava and trap him in there so he kept respawning there, bruh
Lol he beat it with miner fatigue in 20s lol
Escape  gias
Happy b day man love the videos
Happy birthday to you and Love the cinematic and appreciate your work
“Who’s next” chills everywhere man
Will you try to escape Gaia’s vault?
Cool
Hey just saying doom music nearly the whole time is kinda too epic
my friend always betray me and put me in prison with mining fatigue 255 true lol
:D <3 <3 <3
When the doom music kicks in
The bustling fibre technically trouble because july lovely decorate excluding a rural toy. efficient, amusing nitrogen
Mythodak: Unescapable? Heh.. Sounds like a good challenge.
MythrodakTV: *"checkmate."* My brain: *time for some fan art*
The ending gave me chills
This was the coolest one so far
Happy Birthday
this is way more badass than it should be
But it could.....Hmmmm....
One of the best ones yet
Happy birthday!
Hbd
Mythrodack lore theory: His clock can rewind time
Running out of greek gods?
Why not get all the armor ez money
psycho be like
A Cinematic Masterpiece
The big happy ohmy i luhgfe si hard 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 and after the glitch ting an ad apperd
How did you get the pickaxe? There weren’t any in the E-Chest, Barrel and the Load Up station?
happy birthday and my brain is melted you have 10 million IQ
The doom music fits so well Also, Local prison of death trys to contain international criminal, he escapes with the same way terrorist deal with orphanage's U gonna need some stelth for gaia's vault bc if the guards catch u they will activate the chunkban
Mythrodak doesn't miss... damn.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY! and also you are master mind.
At 10:21, Mythro has no pickaxe. There is then a cut.  Now in 10:26, Mythro has a pickaxe. No explanation. Spawned in?
Happy Birthday!!!
Sheeeeeeesh
The ending gave me the chills for hours
Who has goose bumps while watching this??!
4:51, its doom time. This is good reference. Happy birthday! huh, if Mythoradak has a pickaxe, can't the guards alr have one? :/
10:29 ish you have a netherite pickaxe, so they do get them or atleast the warden does.... :/
The “checkmate” at the end always makes me excited
What if you were to escape a prison without any knowledge or anything? Cause obviously if it were survival you wouldn't be able to go into spectator mode and see where all the redstone is to plan an escape. I think that would be a huge challenge. Not only that but it would be very entertaining.
Mythrodak: OH I SEE ANOTHER GOD TIER PRISON FOR ME HMM??? ALSO Mythrodak: GOOD THING I AM ABOVE A GOD TIER XD
Pog
Welp i cant reply to mythrodac so il just comment...HAPPY BIRTHDAY :D
Ray works maybe
Next vid: Escaping Alcatraz  Happy birthday btw :D
Playing BFG Division I love you for that edit: and the only thing they fear is you
The doom soundtrack made this a billion times better
I wonder when will minecraft prison will stop being named with "*vault*"
Who's next
Happy b-day! 🎂🎉
Happy birthday!!!!! 🎂
Mythrodak, escape Gaia's vault
I like the doom music in the background
Yoooooooo
the foundation is still in tact, it can still be repaired!
y with the doom eternal sound track
O_o Happy Birthday @MythrodakTV
gaia's valt
Happy Birthday  and u always give me chills lmao :D
Bro I could probably keep you in a prison without you escaping
As you were remembering what happened a Taco Bell commercial popped up 🤣
Let’s be real. We didn’t come for the lore, but now we’re invested in it
This guy is probably my favorite you-tuber at this point, the roll play he does is just too good. Happy B-Day btw
Never seen this block game more horrifying and  amazing ever. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Epic
Mythrodak escapes Aries Vault with elder guardians and calls it boring so he makes it harder  Me: If you want to make my prison harder to escape it's all yours
Happy Birthday!
Try escaping guardian’s vault when the final version releases
Best video i have seen yet and also happy birthday
Jjkay03 be like:  HOW HOW HOW HOW HOW
🤯
omg omg gaia's vault next like omg
Someone make cancer prison cuz ♋
Happy Birthday!
The only thing they fear, is you.
bruh 11:48 full movie scene
Doom music: starts playing. Me: Ah yes the prison goes brrrrrrr
Daaaaamn the suspence is out of this world
12:23 when the doom music kicks in
kratos vault/god of war vault XD
I’ve learned from mythrodak that the only prison you can’t escape, is school
Fitting that the deadliest prison is named after Ares, God of War and Violence
gotta say man, this is damn epic, awesome i love how dramatic you can make this my favourite part was Blowing up the prison
appreciate the doom music.
Me: I'll use my alt acc....  Argh      MythrodakTV/ *free netherite sht*
The Only prison that is truly inescapable; The Void. The Realm of the Faded Immortals. A place where immortal beings enter once losing the will to live on. A place that resides outside the Multiverse. In Minecraft; TP commands, Creative Flight, and Max Regeneration Commands can give to allow you to survive as you fall for eternity
MYTHROLORE POG
This Chad didn’t just escape the prison, they had a super quick exit without a thought
My favorite so far, I loved all the cinematics and you broke out in the most badass way possible
The tnt at the end!!! It kinda shows that he can escape every prison
Next video: escaping an obsidian box with no light and some air
Happy bday
Moral of the story: Don't put TNT in your death traps, people!
✤  Let's pray for those children who lost both of their parents to  Covid-19. They are Real Star (★)❤️
Happy Birthday! Thanks for the vid its like a bday party for us

GAIA'S VAULT that what i wait
HAPPY LATE BIRTHDAY  CLOCK IN THE BACK MAN 🥳🥳🥳
Im making my own prison
Modded Ares Vault: Lycanite Mobs Avaritia Armed Guards OMT & OMPD Vampires, Werewolves, Xenomorphs, and Advanced Zombies Dragons, Sea Serpents, Gorgons, Trolls, Sirens, and Hydras
Where did you get that netherite pickaxe? 10:26
Yooo gives me Goosebumps
Happy birthday!
Happy Bday Mythrodak also love your content also loved the "checkmate" line at the end!
Fitting that the deadliest prison is named after Ares, God of War and Violence
What about a Zeus Prison? A prison, guarded with lightning-charged trident
Bedrock players: just put em in a dirt cage and put them on visitor *im not hating o bedrock they just have visitor settings*
cool
The check mate Was so poggers
this is the coolest video i hav eever seen
Absolute Chad
Happy birthday 🥳
Your videos are so epic
I want to see a prison built with the idea of no dying that would be used in a server with one cannon life for everyone. So to get into the cell there are no kill zones, and to get out you can't die.
This would heavily improve if you could add some captions, not forcedly in the video but perhaps in the YT captions
That was the most epic checkmate I’ve seen in my life
Rhe cinematography he does is opppppppp❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥
Happy birthday m8
Happy birthday Mythrodack!!!
doom music kicks in me:oh no
swaws
im sorry i was 10 hours late bc my father wont let me use gadgets yesterday btw hapy birthday mythrodak more birthdays to come :)
There’s only 1 problem. If the guards don’t get a pickaxe in the armour equip station how did you? Wasn’t from enderchest and if it was I bet the guards would have 1 too
Damn it I missed the notification
Just a Litle thing you missed(the Gaurds don’t have pics and you have a pic but I think that won’t make that much of a difrence) but keep up the good work!
Doom music kicks in
I POOSH BIG LIEK BOOTUN
Happy birthday
I like the last part of the tnt
Happy Birthday! Your a literal god, the editing is godly too
When the doom music kicks in
Damn I need mythrodak to teach me how to escape a real prison.
Vault you can’t escape your moms vault
Mythrodak:Who's next?! SeenSven:Mythrodak!You have trapped and horrified all of my prison warden friends,Its time you learn a lesson in "Gaia's Vault" Mythrodak:We will see!!
I read jjkay name is john f kay
How the turn tables have turned.  This really could have been a really cool movie.
The ending is epic he is becoming a joker
“Checkmate” -Mythrodak
Next Gigas Vault
What’s with the Greek names
Happy birthday i found your chanel today and i dropped a sub and like
BEFORE WE CREATE ANYMORE INESCAPBLE PRISONS, CAN WE REMIND OURSELVES THAT MINECRAFT IS A BLOCK GAME.
This is like money haste but better
I'm so proud of Mythrodak's content quality getting better throughout the year. His footage was once choppy and his voice was quiet but he's grown so much since then and I love it  Keep up the great work, dude! <3
8:54 oh, so that's why he keeps getting arrested, he's in america
The video has got more views in 10 hours than the prison itself in 1 month xD Edit- Happy bd
Phase 2 intro is so loud
Moat of the prison names are just like Person 1: let's do a vault! Person 2: vault what? Person 1: I don't know how about something from Greece myths? Person 2:: Ares... Vault? Person 1: Perfect. Also happy birthday
sence when did he get inchanted nether pick
when doom music is included thats how you know it gets real
HE CAN’T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIIIIIIS
Up next bedrock prison and I'm guessing he's going to get out with his bare hands
Escape from a real prison
This dude deserves 1 mil, gameplay and the music fit so well
Ares is god of war but why does the prison look like olympius
i'm really enjoying the gradual ramping up of drama and story in these videos
I love the ending !!!
Gaia is all that stands in your way. Break its portal and leave before you enter.
4:52 **when the doom music kicks in**
This one was absolutely destroyed
It was fantastic dude
1:05 :             achievement                         how did i get here
Hoppy Bert Dab
Wait so he didn’t have time to preparer but had a full ended chest of things he needed?
@MythrodakTV you inspired me to start escaping prisons, but with that out of the way, we should make a prison. seeing as we both escape prisons and we know almost every way out of one, i think it would be perfect. dont reply if you want, this is a suggestion
More than inner prison I like the outside of ptlrison
Happy birthday Mythrodak All the best
ok i- just .... love it love it love it love it love it
At this point nothing can stop him
Have any of you guys noticed that all the prisons he escaped are related to Greek mythology?
Dam  this music syncing is great
you  said it only supplied no pickaxe were did you get yours
Happy birthday Mythrodak Also, LOVE that you used Mick Gordon's music. BFG Division is a djenty masterpiece for cinematics 👌
Where did mythordak get the netherite pikaxe at the end it wasent it his ender chest
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!! 🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂
hey i don't have anything to offer but i subscribe i hope you wish a happy birthday 🥳
who else thought the ending was SICK
The narration is amazing though-
wow ur pro
Checkmate
V
This man makes a prison escape in *minecraft* so interesting and climatic. better than most movies hands down
This has inspired me to make a unbreakable prison and I have so many ideas on how the fix the flaws you used to get out
I love how he used doom music for max    i n t e n s i f y
5:10 the moment when I clicked the sub button
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
Happy birthday
Should make a parkour prison
Nice teaser for gaias vault
I think I would make an unexceptionable prison for you but in on Xbox so you can’t play it😞😞
When Doom music kicks in : 4:52
Happy birthday!
Just keep naming em vaults
This is holywood level content
the doom music was a nice touch
Somebody give this man a real prison to escape 😂😂
This is probably the most epic prison escape you have ever done, the end is just epic. :)
2:19
Bro it’s FUCKING DOOM MUSIC
This is so cool
The guard ender peals stasis trap was genius and badass
happy birthday Myth
You always exaggerate these videos

Real quick question u said they didn’t have a pic axe but in the last bit u have a pick axe?????????????
Checkmate
Mythrodak: Narrating JJkay:I m just gonnna smack this guy in the head and put him in prison
Oh wow, that is the most beautiful prison ive ever seen!

mythrodaktv's chill voice just makes everything cooler
when doom music comes in:
Easily your best video!
Mythrodak:I need to break this block Me: pitch black screen
WHEN GAIA VAULT??????????????????????????????????????????????????
Happy birthday day
7:25 Mythrodak being a taunting annoying but wholesome guy
Bro just name a vault the noobs vault because Myth will ALWAYS beat the prison unless you know... bedrock
This is manhunt, but in prison
Happy Birthday!
This Feels kind of cheaty
Happy birthday mythrodak
Mythrodak: I COULD still do it even with elder guardians, but that’s boring  Me: Okay, buddy... 🤨  Mythrodak: *shows how to break out of the prison with elder guardians*   Me: Surprised pikachu face
Good shit
5:02 Me: dying of epicness
I love That u are having fun with these videos through the lore. Thank you so much for this great content. I find these videos very enjoyable.
Checkmate ...... EPIC!!!
next: Escaping a bedrock prison
13:16 Guardians vault..
Most funniest video of mythrodrak
Thats an cracked client
danm, the editing in this was insane!
love the doom music
Happy Birthday
Everyone at 12:48 to 13:00: Omg thats a cool cinematic edit  Me:Wait what how the fuk didnt he lag?
The editing skills are beautiful ❤️
Chills, literal chills.
😆
imma make a vault that just has an obsidian platform and his parrot is being held hostage so if he tries anything to parrot goes boom
Happy birthday bro
😆
😆
I see the first scene and go oh sh*t
since mythrodak has a clock on his back, and he speeds breaking blocks up by a thousandfold, And with him escaping all of these vaults of greek gods, my headcanon is that he is kronos, lord of time
Op editing 🔥🔥
I love the doom soundtrack
You should start an SMP where people work together to make a prison strong enough to withhold you.
pure bullying lmaoo
YES JUST YESS
as soon as i saw aphrodite's vault i was very excited. please let this be a hint. thanks.
Prison idea: bed rock cage
Anybody else keep on replaying the checkmate scene?? BECAUSE THAT WAS *EPIC*
The editing is perfect
There goes my idea for a vault named Ares’s Bastille…
You should do a video on vault 36
prison builders, here is a challenge for you and mythrodak, to build and to beat, a vault that includes all aspects of every vault, and call it somethin like Olympus Vault.
H A P P Y  B I R T H D A Y
Gaia's vault creeps me out.
been reading Percy Jackson lately, now i can understand which gods are which
The transition from checkmate was perfect
AYOOOOO THIS GUY IS INSANEEEEEE so im a SeenSven Fan ,asn at first i thought this guy was lame BUT DUDE I WAS SO WRONGGGG even the editiing is insaneee
It’s my cousin birthday
me and my friends are making a prison we should bo done in a week or so
mythrodak is the equivalent to doom guy to prisons
this like 52 storeys deep in lore
HAPPY BIRTHDAY this would be the most greatest escape considering it’s your birthday
OMG YES!!!!
This guy's editing skills are unmatched. I'm in disbelief...
Somebody's been playing DOOM
Does any1 actually feel that his voice is a bit different like a new mic or he’s just like more happy xD
Your getting above 15 frames and the video is now 1080p. New PC?
happy birthday mythodrak
Pandora vault
I'm sure your still reading the seventeen pages about what the gards have to do for gaia valt it can instantly ban all players from the sever but good luck
"checkmate" was so badass
Someone should build a giant vault and call it "ur mom's vault"
Mythrodak: BOOM EASY Me: XD  Mythrodak: *being this dramatic know* Me: XD Mythrodak: at the end of the video Me: O-O
this was like a shortfilm! crazy what all can you do with a block game  :)
Hope you had a good birthday
Honestly u seem like u would be a perfect member of th dream smp
Jjkay after watching : i have to add a pick
Happy birthday @mythrodrakTV
I know that you wanted a video but if you had mining fatigue three this would not work
You forgot to mention that if you hadn't stopped the water from going down into the cell the guards would have went up and stopped you
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!!
____ vault, please be original
youre so big brain
"who's next?" there u go lol
And then in one fell swoop i /clear Mythrodak
Awwwwahhh gawwdd this deserves an oscar.
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday 🥳 (and imagine escaping a prison on your birthday...)
Happy birthday🎂
Why are his Videos so Satisfying 🤤
You want to know why I am not using the command. Because it would make a super boing video. That part was funny
This is so well animated and just watch out. There is copyright for the song ur using and I don’t wanna get copyrighted on your birthday
We all know what prisons next....Gaias vault
this man can weasel his way out of the weird convo after your parents catch you doing the deed.
when the doom music kicks in
I think Mythrodak is slowly turning into a prison breaker Version of doom guy
everyone gangsta until mythrodak doesn't post after a new prison is invented
who is next
Ahhhh tht is epic
Mission Complete  Rank: Unbeatable
No one can contain this man
everyone gangsta until mythrodak makes his own prison and escapes it
Mhthrodak: why did you capture me?   Guards: you made a fool out of all of the prison my friends made…
Awesome editing amazing
Happy Bday to you bruh
Happy birthday
Doom music goes very well with this
My man has gotten to good at "escaping prison" he can just make a 4 second clip of him getting out like it not even a challenge as this point unless he adds more rules to make it harder. lol
The only man haha can trap him is Mumbo jumbo
happy b day and also epic vid
this is an art form
Try escaping a truly inescapable prison. Hypixel Skyblock
the doom music is perfect
This was the most badass escape
There is no stopping this man.
Happy bday
How did you get a netherite pickaxe all of the sudden? The video cuts and suddenly you have it. Was it just to speed everything up?
Everyone gangster until mythrodak escapes gaia's vault
Come on dude When is Gaia's vault comin
I’m not normally a person who comments on videos but I had to just to commend you for your amazing story telling and videography skills. Your “breaking out of *blank* vault” series is very entertaining. It always feels like one of those ocean eleven films.   The only problem I have with this video in particular is that you set it up like you were captured before you know anything about the vault but to break out you used strategies that only someone with knowledge of the vault would know. Ik you did that just for entertainment and theatrics so it’s nothing big, but it’s just a minor critique to a well put together video.
I can make a dirt prison for you
Happy Birthday.
Bro, the check mate, I loved this. True Madlad.
What the hell did you do to get put in these prisons on the first place??
The doom music at the end makes it so much better
C h e c k m a t e
It's cool when you say checkmate my mind blows
Happy birthday I love you and your vids
wait a sec aint shiratori (or however you say it)  that prison ascape dude
Thank you for taking the time to make this a cinematic experience. This was awesome. That "who's next" at the end gave me slight chills. You put so much extra effort into this than most would and these videos are so cool and this was one was EVEN better and higher production value. To reward you for this I liked, added to playlists, and I am now finishing this comment in order to give you all the algorithm boosting power I can as an individual!!! Please keep this production level up IT'S AWESOME.
but it dosent .but it could be-
Mythrodak: Who's next? Seensven: Well frick
HEY DO GAIA'S VAULT NEXT IT WOULD BE A CHALLENGE
Happy bday!!
“Ferb, I know what we’re doing today”
U r sooo mass marnam
Please escape kingtons  valt
that was epic
gaias vault
jjkay03 sounds so much like the russian villains in probably every secret agent movies
Step one download hacks
Mythrodaktv:kaboom Me: yes mythrodaktv kaboom
The doom soundtrack just has that extra hell you need
these prisons are coming faster than mythrodak can make an amazing cinematic video escaping them
When r u gonna escape Gaia’s vault
HAPOY BIRTHDAY MANS
Fantastic use of the Doom soundtrack! I am definitely favoriting this video!
Notice how he hasn’t escaped Gaia’s vault yet
This guy really just said fuck you this is my prison now
Best video of minecraft prison escape I have ever seen,loved it
It's incredible how with each new episode the production value just goes up even more. Amazing content as always, you are killing it! Very proud of you <3
Next time I want you to escape with the maximum capacity of guards actively there and trying to stop you. This will (maybe) give you a real challenge.
I call this man mister miracle
The big happy got me, new sub
Ayy some doom soundtracks from 2016 to eternal nice to see The first is command and control from the 6th level of eternal The second one is familiar to 2016, but idk the name The third is the only thing they fear is you (great song) on the 5th level of eternal  The next is a bit from cultist base, the third level The next part seems vague But the final one, BFG division, one of the best 2016 songs in my opinion. The name of the prison probably prompted these song choices, but look at my playlist “The genre is violence” there are some potentially great song picks
Happy Birthday Mythrodak
Recommendation - Try escaping gaias vault by seensven if you can
Checkmate was so amazing
Mythrodak just speedrun breaking out of prison
Oh no This guy is a very very smart
My birthday was the day before yesterday AKA june 4
I wanna see a hephaestus the god of making things like that like the most complicated red stone in a prison now that would be cool
Happy birthday Mythrodak :D
cool music
The editing of the explosion part is GODLY
JJKAY03 : There is mining fatigue 3! Mythrodak: Ya but that's gonna be a boring
HAPPY BIRTH DAY
He literally just went “this prison is too easy and boring to escape normally, so I’ll make it harder for me”
Happy Birthday bro
Absolute genius
Why does the blowing up the prison part looks like an action movie?
It’s not A for Ares, it’s A for Amogus.
I love your content man keep doing what you do !
Is it just me or anyone who thinks u can just build him a bedrock cage who he obviously can't escape
Bruh that “checkmate” gave me chills.
Happy birthday king Try escape Gaiga vault v2 most op prison
Happy Birthday King Mythrodak
happy borthday
4:51 the DOOM music hits hard, also, happy bday
How I finally know why he was locked up in the first place.  FINALLY.
10:20 watch for about ten seconds. No pickaxe in his E chest, then boom, he has one. He also specifically said that guards didn’t get pickaxes so there’s no way he got one from their loot
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MAN
WAKE UP EVERYONE, MYTHRODAKTV UPLOADED A NEW VIDEO!!!
Why do you have a pickaxe?
I love the doom music being used here. Bfg division was perfectly timed for the explosion at the end. Keep being awesome, Mythrodak, and happy birthday
0:45 as soon as I clicked on a vid "watch later" tht sound spooked me T_T
Escape Gaga’s vault
This is truly incredible. Your cinematography skills are growing rapidly and the plan and the story that goes with it is truly incredible. The cliff hanger at the end. Happy birthday mythrodak.
good
"check mate"
Birthday
Lol today my beautiful too
Happy bday!
I mean GAIAS
R u going to do GAURDIANS VAULT?
New pc pog
I pressed the Red Button = Mythrodak Big Happy
Here we go again
Happy birthday!!
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Another great video!
Holy shit this is so Fucking Cool
Amazing video :D also happy b day!
Idea: escape a prison with absolutely no knowledge about it
My gift for Mythrodak is Subscribing to him. What's yours?
escape daedalus's labyrinth
Sweet videos btw
More flashing= seizures =happy
so... he definitely over hypes his videos but they are still cool
When the doom music kicks in  :Mythrodak :)
Happy birthday 😊
They should have named the prison Tartarus’s vault, Tartarus being the god of imprisonment
when doom music kicks in:
Happy birthday mythrodak
Mythodak my question is how did you get your picaxe
What he said they didn’t have pickaxes in the guard center but yet he got one from there
the only thing they fear is mythrodaktv
new sub
Doom music intensifies
todAy I wIlL eScaPe with A tOOtH piCK
Well, Ares would hate this prison He doesn't like prisioners being ill treated at all
When mythrodak said “checkmate” that was the coolest moment in history of minecraft
DO GUARDIAN VAULT PLZZ
OMG
So you cheated lol.
The production quality is 👌
I swear, Mythrodak is like the Yoshie Shiratori of Minecraft.
Check mate haha
Holy shit this video is good
"i'm very hard to see, because my skin is mostly black"
Happy birthday
Happy happy birthday mythrodak
Not again Myth oh my god
the doom music OMFG, a masterpiece of a video
At 6:39 Mythrodak clearly states that guards and wardens don’t have pickaxes However later in the video at 10:59 he uses an enchanted netherite pickaxe to help him escape. This most defiantly shows he cheated in this escape because if the guards had the same pickaxes they would be able to break through the obsidian they were trapped in.
Happy birthday ma boi🤠
why is every prison named after greek and roman mythology
When Doom music kicks in:
Literally all of the guards be like: why do I hear boss music
Happy birthday Mythrodak! Your content is one of the greatest, the intense scenes, the music, and the genius ness of ur brain. Continue your content magic escape man🎂🔓🗝
Cultist Base? Niiiiiice. Edit: and... BFG10k, maybe some tracks from Doom 2016? And The Only Thing They Fear Is You. Back into Cultist Base. Straight to BFG Division. As a major Doom fan, I found this selection... adequate.
MythrodakTV: escaping every prison. FBI: sweats intensely
This video is incredible, you're awesome dude but just a bit of headphone warning lol
Tru escape 2b2t end
Edit: Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah gaias vault
Liked because you used the Doom Eternal soundtrack.
hay bro i love your vid and its so much better day by day i mean vid by vid
AH HELLLL NAHHH BRUH
Thanks
12:40 when the doom music kicks in
this series is so good!
doom eternal music nice
Happy birthday 🎉

Happy birthday mythrodak!

i love how at first he just does this little 10 second montage of him being able to leave the prison
5:12 what is this song?
The smart gas perioperaively boil because australian theoretically want aside a lopsided field. industrious, purple title
This guy escaped this prison by breaking into the warden’s room and then trapping the guards in obsidian. wow
happy bday mythro
Yo, what was that at the end
It’s our because the lazy builders didn’t supply pickaxes
try subterrean vualt it traps you in natural spawning bedrock
Mythodak is someone who has no rights to be this cool. I get goosebumps from watching a blockman escaping a prison
Happy bday myth!
Happy Birthday Myth!! ❤️
happy birthday dude ^_^
Happy birthday Mythrodak!
Great Video!
HOW DO YOU THINK OF THESE THINGS?!
Ooh BFG division

doom eternal the only thing they fear is you
DOOM MUSIC GO BRRRRRR
We giv you 1 mill
MythrodakTV trying to remember how he got there: *The numbers Mason, what do they tell you?*
The doom music i love it🥰
The doom music i love it🥰
That was the best escape yet
Happy bday!
Happiest BIRTHDAY
What happens if someone makes a prison to trap the bird as bait for Mythrodak?? It would make everything much more difficult since birds only get 1 life
Pls do Gaia’s Vault
bro the glitching while entering the prison gave me bo1 memories "what do the numbers mean mason"
Yayy
Where did he get the pickaxe?!
Happy Birthday 🎉🎉🎉
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MYHRODAK!  Plz pass it on?
Now comes Gaia’s prison this could be difficult
Ya already know things are about get serious when the DOOM music kicks in.
The bigger the prison the harder they fall
MYTHORAK: Checkmate Me: He’s better than Dream
Checkmate!
Happy birthday! 🎂
Gaia prison is next
its my mums birthday today, are you my mum?
Doom music kicks in: prison already broken out of
lol nice doom music
Shiratori be like: when u coming back?
*C H E C K M A T E*
Mythrodak has so quickly become my fav youtuber he’s tied with dream😂
Aye yo birthday
checkmate more like deathmate
You videos are top quality
what a cool escape 😳
This channel is growing fast
my 5 year old self: why don't you just do bed rock box
This is amazing
Thats not how it works
Damn, Mythrodak's pissed!!!!! The "checkmate"  you said before the TNT was the most badass thing ever. Also happy b-day :)
Literal chills this gave me literal chills
Mythrodak when someone builds a prison : Aww shit, here we go again
Prison builders wasting there life trying to build a prison to stop Mythrodak Me: just builds builds bedrock around him Me: HAHAHAHA TRY TO ESCAPE NOW HAHAHA
That Gaea’s Vault bit at the end seems like the ultimate challenge due to the level of insanity the thing’ll take to gtfo of.
At first, you said that the guards did not have any pickaxes. However, when you managed to reach the guards room after a cut from the wardens room you had a pickaxe. (He did not have a pickaxe in his ender chest)
I LOVED the ending you do so good on the videos keep up the hard work
Your videos are like movies thrill cinematic scenes fabulous music i can watch them all day😍😍😍
I give you mythrodak the power of the colossal giga chad.
Why would you not sub lets be honest here
Happy Birthday!
this guy needs to be in the DreamSMP
Mythrodak is like the minecraft version of Yoshie Shiratori.
Bruhhh at least let him finish the explanation
This is so well put together
Would you escape 5 by 5 bedrock???
2 people: spend countless hours just so that Mythrodak wont escape Mythrodak: Not only escapes, but only leaves behind an empty obsidian shell of a prison.
My gosh this guy is a 10000000IQ!
Bro imagain having such a bad prison that the prisoner got full nethieright armor
4:49: when the doom music kicks in
Im 7 hours late that music was so loud. Also loving the story so far it must take a lot of planning for videos like these. Fun to watch
BIG BRAIN
This guy doesn't play along with what the guards want him to do. No no no, this man is so powerful that he plays along with what HE wants to do.
That checkmate gave me chills
Pretty sure you can get out gais vault no problem
EVERYONE SHOULD SUBSCRIBE TO MYTHRODAKTV
Happy birthday
Is it just me or dose his voice make it sound like he is going more and more insane with every prison he gets put in
big happy
My brain when explained the boring way🐸
13:16 Yoru using ulti be like:
Prison break But in minecraft
5:10 when doom music kicks in
Honestly I don't sub to people unless I watch them consistently but this mans deserves it
Every ending is so epic :0
Epic
Can't wait for the Gaias vault escape!!!!!!
Si vis pacem, para bellum
First of all great video and it have me shivers just watching it and not to leave out the time u take to study the whole thing  PD: Happy bday :D
This might be officially your best video ever  An actual masterpiece
You not only escaped this place, you also completely compromised the use of the place completely with the destruction of the warden bed and trapping the guards/killing them with the tnt.  That prison is NEVER being used again Now onto destroying Gaia’s vault.  Bonus points for freeing the other prisoners or destroying the chunk bans.
Checkmate, S L A P P E R S 🎸👋
the music is so good
LOVE THE INTRO AND HAPPY BDAY
in case you didnt notice, doom's soundtrack played the whole video
I could probally take the challenge but its at  the most impossable but you would need Trillions of blocks for it, cause mine are semi over kill.
Shiratori the parrot Eyy
OML MYTH
A happy birthday to you mythrodak
The picaxe is appring outof thin air
This  Was AWSOME
Is this a movie i am sorry?!??!?!?!?!
Happy birthday mythro    *but seriously i dont even know this vault and he escaped*
Can I just say that this video was so amazing and all the music and editing was absolutely fantastic! Thanks for the great vid.
Happy birthday
Gaias vault plz
Yo that ending was so cool 😂😂 love ur vids
The special effects are very well done
“Checkmate” damn he’s so good literal chills from that line
The prisons before ,you escaped sneakily, but this is just savage.
They say "The bigger they are, the harder they fall" and this was definitely no exception
What Mythodak sounded to me while escaping the prison:           Substitutex=cos\alp,\alp∈[0:;π] \displaystyle Then\; |x+\sqrt{1-x^2}|=\sqrt{2}(2x^2-1)\Leftright |cos\alp +sin\alp |=\sqrt{2}(2cos^2\alp -1)Then∣x+  1−x  2   ​	  ∣=  2 ​	  (2x  2  −1)\Leftright∣cos\alp+sin\alp∣=  2 ​	  (2cos  2  \alp−1) \displaystyle |\N {\sqrt{2}}cos(\alp-\frac{\pi}{4})|=\N {\sqrt{2}}cos(2\alp )\Right \alp\in[0\: ;\: \frac{\pi}{4}]\cup [\frac{3\pi}{4}\: ;\: \pi]∣N  2 ​	  cos(\alp−  4 π ​	  )∣=N  2 ​	  cos(2\alp)\Right\alp∈[0;  4 π ​	  ]∪[  4 3π ​	  ;π] 1) \displaystyle \alp \in [0\: ;\: \frac{\pi}{4}]\alp∈[0;  4 π ​	  ] \displaystyle cos(\alp -\frac{\pi}{4})=cos(2\alp )\dotscos(\alp−  4 π ​	  )=cos(2\alp)… 2. \displaystyle \alp\in [\frac{3\pi}{4}\: ;\: \pi]\alp∈[  4 3π ​	  ;π] \displaystyle -cos(\alp -\frac{\pi}{4})=cos(2\alp )\dots−cos(\alp−  4 π ​	  )=cos(2\alp)…
this is so cinematic
THIS WAS EPIC
love the videos!
What’s that song in the intro
I just love that his parrot is named Shiratori.
A good vault idea and name Apollo’s vault
GAIA'S VAULT?? HMMMMMMM
just for the ending, im dropping a sub and liking

Viewer 209,000 30 minutes after post
wait mythrodak, you said that the gaurds kits dont have a pickaxe and you didn't have a pickaxe in your enderchest. where did you get the pickaxe 10:53
Imagine it was Athena’s vault Strategy vs Strategy I see
Pov: your zodiac is an Aries
EPIK
This guy really just used half the video as an introduction.*slow clapping*
just make a bedrock box with hundreds of layers
I'm so gonna make a prison for him to escape lol
Happy Birthday!
Gias vault?
His pumpkin fren is the one thar trapped him in all the prisons i think
best one so far
Look 13:15
He be like next caller next caller :))
Jesus man, really gonna hit us with that BOPPIN intro
I have nothing no beacon and in a platform with a pit of death beneath me however the guard made one critical mistake, they left me with a strain of hair and my left pinky toe nail. This is thesues’s  vault and I have escaped it   -mythrodak 2021
Love your DOOM music!
Not only do I get to escape but I get to explode the prison kill 3 people and steal sign me UP!
This dude can be the best prison tester
Random dude: so i built this pri- Mythrodak: Done. Next?
The tnt montage was kinda cool ngl
Ironic how my zodiac is ARES as well as the god ARES
Anyone remember that movie about that dude who escapes prisons for a living? And he wrote a book about all the ways he got out. Then someone built a prison off of his book, then put him in it....  So Mythrodak, make a prison
If Zylenox was in prison:
This was mythrodaks coolest video and definetly one of the est minecraft videos full stop, the escape was so smart and well planned and the ending was perfect as well. And to on top of all that it had doom ost used incredibly well
Main menu doom eternal music be SLAPPING
Can't wait for gaia's vault!
so your never gonna escape gaia's vault?
Whether it’s a Monday, a Tuesday, a Wednesday, or a Thursday, whenever Mythrodak uploads, it’s a good day
I hit big red button so number go up and Mythrodak become big happy!
This has to be the coolest escape he’s done
This ain't youtube no more this this is a movie a masterpeice
This edits are sick bro, keep on going.   Sorry but i need. Next episode: escaping alcatraz irl
Mythrodak be like: "You may have outsmarted me, but I outsmarted your outsmarting"
the editing made this so much more epic
This editing style will almost look like dream
Try to escape Gaia's vault next.
this is the training arc for escaping the 'innescapable' vault
This is reverse we get good content from the birthday boi
best one of the escape vids yet
"But there is one last thing that i need to do.....Hello ive made my way out of your fortress im sorry about this but i need to make sure this place doesn't hurt anyone else on my way out of your prison i filled every room with tnt and right before i left i ignited it............Checkmate!"
Dude the moment where he said if it’s a war he wants it’s a war he gets!
imagine escaping simp jail be like epic boom
This is what we all wanted
This is a cinematic masterpiece
Your editing is getting way better and so entertaining!
“Who next” sent a shiver down my spine... it’s going to be awesome
This was my favorite escape video by far, the explosion at the end really took the cake for best end scene!
When the doom music kicks in:
Happy birthday Mythrodak!
12:47
Happy birthday also it looks like a portal based game or the part in portal 1 where you escape the fire trap and trying to reach glados to murder/defeat her
So since I have no idea where to put this idea, I guess I'll put it here. Why does the respawn point need to be on the overworld? It could very well be on the nether, simply put a respawn anchor, with pistons force the player out of the nether to a portal using observers to detect when a glowstone is gone and destroy the portal the moment the player goes through. That way, he has no access to his respawn point from his cell. Only way he could reach it is if he somehow manages to put a fire on the portal, which I find will be highly unlikely, even nearly impossible. Then again, there are some flaws, the portals are a tricky thing to get down correctly, and if he somehow makes the Respawn anchor waste a charge and not respawning, he could get past the piston activation, although I doubt it, since it only wastes glowstone when someone respawns. As for fuel, I'm thinking about 100 double chests full of glowstone, so he'd have to somehow die for weeks on end to be able to exhaust the supplies, but then again, this strategy is one witch farm away from being negated (infinite glowstone) so yeah, food for thought, if you wanna use this please credit me uwu
Mythrodak does not fear prison. Prison fears Mythrodak
happy birth day mythrodak and i love u saying checkmate it so intidimiating
Oh... RIP SEENSVEN            SEENSVEN WAS OVERKILLED BY TOO MANY PRISONS
Masterpiece
You should do an escape with actual guards watching you
That please subscribe intro was the best and funniest one yet
When the tnt is blowing up y is where oof sound
Ares vault : fight like hell to escape
if mythrodak  had prepare: set a ender peral statis chamber with a few thousand red stone repeater on the longest tick and before he went into the prsion he escape
Oh oh GIA'S is in DANGER
Gaia's vault
Big happy Mythrodak is terrifying 0:35
Mythrodak : **explodes a prison** 2b2t players : pffft a normal day on the "oldest anarchy server in minecraft"
Happy birthday!
This is the best one yet
the only thing they fear is you
7:18 Click to open the bed tarp #1
Pinned comment: It’s my birthday, this’s my gift to you! Me: I don’t think you know how birthdays work...
He now also know the Art of using doom music correctly.
Why is among us on the front door
I think I know how to break out of Gaia’s vault
Holy the best one yet
Happy birthday MythrodakTV!
Happy birthday😊🥰👍💯💕💞💖
No ones putting forth as much effort into their videos as this guy is, amazing!
MythorodakTV: its my birthday today  me: i guess ill subscribe
Mythrodak - Command blocks aren't in survival so we won't use them Also Mythrodak - So we are going to be using commands...
They can’t see me cause my skin is black😂😂
Happy bday
if mythrodak was an scp he would be euclid class
Happy birthday
He didn’t just escape this time, he escaped with a fresh set of netherite armor, and a bunch of guard corpses
i respect the music choice as the only thing prison wardens fear..     *is you*
Happy birthday and good vid
dude this is insane, the editing, the voice lines, the escape, everything. best prison escape video yet
me: oh, a mythrodak video! I know what to expect and I'm excited! the video: no smuggling items me: what??? the video: guards see the prison at all times me:   :O mythrodak: if it's a war they want, then it's a war they'll get me:  HOW DOES HE MAKE EACH VIDEO EXPONENTIALLY BETTER THAN THE LAST??????
Dude the DOOM music made it so much better
I didnt click on this as i thought it was another standard minecraft documentary but autoplay sent me here. I was gonna click off but that intro got me hooked
checkmate
Why did you blow up the prison they worked so hard on it
You cant escape the dream smp vault they would kill you
Noooo all the hard work
Smothered Checkmate LITTERALY
Mythrodak: Gets the guards gear. Mythrodak: Now I AM THE GUARD MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Wait how did he get a pickaxe from the armor equip station?
The cinematography is amazing and I'm loving the lore! Keep up the amazing work!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY THIS ESCAPE IS AWWEEESSSOOOMMMEEEE
Its the dream jail in a nutshell
Your a god of breakout prison and happy birthday
Mythrodak in Minecraft hell escaping the land of hades also happy birthday your content gets better and better every video keep up the good work I clicked so faster than you can say Prison
You should do an escape with Macgyver level ingenuity using a handful of weird items that only make sense once you use them to escape
I've been waiting for gaia's vault since i saw the video, btw i love this series, keep it up
Very well done
The doom music made mythrodak escape
Who dare imprison him on his birthday
Bet you can't escape gaias vault
I just respect and love you putting in Doom music.
Wait how did a dsmp prison turns to this
lol the intro was 5 mins in
Jeez that ending man
can i just say i love the ‘movie’ theme of the prison escapes
11:06 Wait a minute, I though the guard kits didn’t have pickaxes?
That Doom music wanted to make me go to prison and break out lol
<3 that’s all%
I feel like i just watched a action movie. THAT WAS SO AWESOME!
the only thing they fear is you, remember that Mythrodak
The reason I subscribe to this guy cuz the sound effect is so good and edit is good and know how to escape any prison
When will you do Gaia’s vault
Happy birthday
Gaia’s vault stays įñęśçãpâbłę
He should has said you locked me up alright but you know Ares hasn't had a good history locking up people. Guard: what do you mean Protagonist: remember Kratos God of War music kicks in
By far the coolest video yet
Olmost every prison -obsidian walls -insane redstone -lava and water on each side (Add more)
It’s funny how people used to make prisons to beat Pandora’s vault on the dream smp, but now it’s just directed  to Mythro lol
This is amazing and the doom music makes it even better
I'm not first,  I'm not last,  But when Mythrodak posts,  I click fast
"obsidian is suprisingly quick to mine, only like 5 mins"      "i dont know how long the obsidian will keep them locked in" ah yes
He is unstoppable what if he went to a irl prison xD -ADgamer777
the music fits so perfectly
Happy birthday
Almost 200 K, a few weeks ago you just had 40 K, amazing!
Your editing has gotten so much better then the first prison escape. It’s done so well :))
No creative
Escape this barrier block 1by1
Next it’s gonna be like Kronos Vault or something like they are naming so many prisons like Olympian Gods and stuff.
i alredy knew your gonna blow up the prison once you had all that tnt        the priso is gonna blow up sky high
I like the bfg division for the final song
Heh my b day was yesterday best present
Why do I fell like they are going to make a v2 of this
Happy birthday. Amazing video
Coolest video so far
Mythyrodak pls try gaias vault
POYO
12:05 bro thats EPIK!
When will you do Gaia’s Vault or Vault 36
this guy is so cringey lol he tries to act like a anime character lmfao
You know things are about to go down when mythrodak uses the doom (2016 and eternal) soundtrack.
Why would someone not sub to someone. Like I subbed nearly everyone I watch because there is no reason to not. Of YouTube recommendeds it to me then I must like there channel. And if I don’t I can just not watch there videos. After a while YouTube will get I don’t like their channel and stop recommending it to me. So my point is sub to everyone you see to be a nice person
did you get ur new pc u talked about
11:48 uhh... that... is a little cruel.
can u make another videos like the how i became a pirate video
No doubt that I love the video, I just think that I still need ears soooo
0:32 the ammount of effort i put into my WW2 presentation
Best ways to escape all prison is to not go in the prison
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MYTHRODAK
Happy Birthday Mythorodak! I couldn’t reply to your original comment, so I’ll say it here.
SeenSven: *sweating *
Hello
That was sick 😳
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
Man I’m so excited for you next video
happy birthday and congrats stepping into adulthood
Happy b day :)
4:52 the only thing they fear is you starts and that’s when you know shits bouta get real
THE DOOM MUSIC OH NO
have you done vault 36?
Doom music kicks in
happy birth myth
“Who’s next?” *Seensven starts shaking*
bro I love the doom music soooo much (I'm basically asking you to use it more lol)
13:21 this is aggressive
Escaping arse vault.
I have been checking this channel like 2 times a day in hopes that you would post. :D I also I am crazy excited for Gaia’s vault.
I guess the prison is for the guard and the warden
Next video: entering Fort Knox in real life
Happy birthday
I really like the story and lore behind just the escaping the prison
It's all fun and games until Zues' prison is made
That first bed break plan was such a FU to this prison
NOT ONLY DOES HE ESCAPE BUT ON TOP OF THAT HE BLOWS IT ALL UP?!?!?!?!
JOE IS NEXT btw happy birthday
the doom music works so well with this
Bruh i can't reply to mythrodak LET ME REPLY GARBAGE PHONE
I like that gaias vault teaser at the end
Omg happy birthday!!!!!!
happy bday 😃🥳
That ending tho
Mythrodak, what are your opinions on the chunks bans in Gia's vault or will we learn in the next video???
Also as for who's next you should do thubb once he's done with his final version
why is your voice pitch is higher than I use to hear
The end was fantastic
He played the DOOM soundtrack the entire time
Bruh yeah need to calm down
gosh how are all his vids sooooo goood
THANK GOD SHIRATORI IS OKAY- I MEAN GREAT JOB GETTING OUTTA PRISON OH AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY :D
Dude the first five mins thirty seconds was like... FRIGGEN AMAZING! So was the rest of the vid
I have a feeling the next vault is Hera vault or haphestus vault
!mlaer rorrim eht morf yadhtriB yppaH
Why is there random soul sand and oak wood and a random pillar of slime blocks in a prison? They should've put obsidian
I guess I'll sub ;) Ask and you'll be given
How many prisons are there in Minecraft wtf?
Jail is temporary...  But doom is eternal
This is absolutely madness
Still waiting for scraping gias vault
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
escape bankers vault u can’t
5:10 When the DOOM music kicks in
THIS IS F****** AWESOME
littlle dramatic :)
Looking forward to escaping Gaia's Vault with a deflated balloon and some toothpaste.
THIS IS STRAIGHT-UP A MOVIE
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! 🎂🎉🎊🎈🎁
The dislikes are from the guards
Bro the TNT announcement gave me chills
I LOVE DOOM MUSIC
I can't reply to him on his bday but happy bday
i love so much the edit, like the doom soundtrack is in the perfect spot
I made an inescapable prison called the devils vault. You would probably escape in 8seconds
My birthday gift is liking and suscribing
Mythordak forgot to break his head out of the mini prison cell now that is the ultimate prison
E
When the doom music kicks in “Mythrodak 1v3 guards with full netherite with his hands”
Love this. The type of stuff i love
im sub i love your vids
Mythrodak's birthday today but he tortured himself to critical thinking. I very appreciate when you SUBSCRIBE to  him he put a lot of effort. i love this guy.
My guy has blood type L and has the L smarts TOO
Loving the Doom themes
what was that prison at the end 0_0
Most epic prison yet!
How many times do people have to see the proof? Too many prisons have been left behind to collect dust. We have entered a new era, welcome to the War of Vaults. Also, Happy Birthday Mythrodak.
Happy birfday
I really liked the doom music.
All the prisons seem very secure but seems like maybe there is a way to escape it, except gias vault. Idk how you are going to get out of that one
Cool editing and happy b day
That smile is actually cursed.  (How rude of me... And HAPPY B-DAY)
Happy birthday mythrodak! 🥳🥳
The ending was so Legendary
The build was probably built with world edit  just cause the size
I loved how he said people should subscribe
Happy birthday, you’ve been doing  a great job with the music and editing. This was SO FUCKING COOL.
Best... ending... EVER
10:26 where you got that pick
5:10 When the DOOM music kicks in
Ahh yes the blow up obsidian go bye bye trick
This video was amazing
Pog
Why are there 2 conveniently placed pieces of wood there. I get that it might be because the guards have axes and need to mine it faster for refilling but come on. And fuck off with the mining fatigue good luck breaking that obsidian.
“Vault”
Happy Birthday Mythrodak!
I can’t wait for Gaia’s vault escape.
Does anyone know what song he used in the background for the escape?
GAIA'S VAULT PLEASE
The fancy bus separately identify because coffee relevantly trust lest a good powder. cut, instinctive facilities
Using the Doom OST at the end was perfect, this feels like watching a movie!
6:20 dam
plot twist: they are all making them possible to escape so he puts them in a video
Blowing up the prison was like the perfect cherry on top
editing was epic good job!
MythrodakTv: my skin is Mostly black  Me:But MYThRodak your face is white!
this whole series can be a movie all together
That doom music hit different
Checkmate.
Hmm hearing the DOOM soundtrack in the background
I love the dramatic music!
The half apartment grossly wait because trade etiologically cough onto a violent macrame. stiff, vacuous star
This was amazing!!!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY! :D
My favourite bit was: "Checkmate"  And happy birthday MythrodakTV
Happy birthday
I subscribed, did I make you happy ?
happty birdtlhay
THE EDITING LOOKS SO SICK!
Happy birthday!
I am subbed, so I assume you are happy
HAPPY B-DAY!!!
Aphrodites vault should treat you so well you don’t want to leave

Happy Birthday Mythrodak!🎉🎊 Also your intros are awesome😁
MythrodakTV: I escaped a bedrock cage with air! It's quite simple actually...
do the black hole next
U deserve like 999999999999999 subscribers
If I could I would give you $1,000,000 dollars for ur birthday but if I did then my parents would kill me.
Why tf is there so many prisons named after Greek gods ares, hades, titan, Poseidon etc.
It's cool how this series used to just be him escaping the prison but now he's made a story out of it
I like the use of the doom music
Nobody can contain me Me:can you escape a bedrock edition prison
When u escape Gaia's vault
9:34 Except, if they saw the light from the torch, and you had mining fatigue, then the guards would come down before you could break the piston.
Happy birthday
Nice doom music
Gaia's Vault...  Anyone agree?
Happy birthday and how the what you so good
The reply thing was all filled up so happy birthday 🥳🎉🎉
Pog
Now we wait for Gaia's Vault
Escape rays works prison it's immpossible
Ur awesome keep it up hasbdhdbe :)
You could absolutely make an amazing Minecraft machinama with this cinematography
You literal madman thanks for the vid
Wait how'd he randomly get a netherite pick at 10:24
soon he can get out of bedrock box with out anything and world spawn in it
Good job with the music  Its always a banger

My birthday was 9 days ago
12:45 when You didn't fix the sabotage Happy b-day btw
Happy brthday!!! 🥳🥳🥳🎊🎊🎊🎉🎉🎉
10000000/10 Editing XDD
Deadly    then if u die alot u will just escape out without even doing anything
Course you play doom music lol
these prisons makin the dream smp one look like a simple iron bar cage
Why do they keep naming the vaults after Greek gods?
I’d love to see this strategy on the prisons you have escaped using things you’ve smuggled in. Albeit no items could be a challenge, I’d love to see you try it
he becam a psyco 0.o
Oh my gosh! How fun is this. And the INTRO!! So fun! Thanks for a awesome video as always
Dude literally make their chamber a glass case.
U should make a movie about how ur like a wanted criminal and getting captured and just escaping
Gg and happy bday!!!
GREAT ANOTHE VAULT
nice doom eternal music music with the tnt
Isn’t that a bit overkill?
Doom msic
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH THE QUALITY AND STYLE OF YOUR VIDEOS ARE INCREDIBLE!!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY <3
When the doom music kicks in.
Next idea: Aphrodite’s Vault: a prison so comfortable and beautiful you won’t want to escape it.
tf2        don't take this seriously
mythrodak really be like "u thought lol"
The playlist for these should be "Minecraft's series of most escapable prisons"
good luck with gaia's vault...
This guy broke out of a jail in 2 seconds lol
Holy crap, Mind Palace Sherlock Holmes style intro
Best video and ending ever + happy birthday
dang it I was here like 13 mins before the premiere and then I had to do yard work lmao, whatever this is gonna be good regardless
AMAZING VIDEO YET AGAIN! Seriously, the production value and just everything in general is just amazing!
Me next plz i will defet u with mah feet !
eventually they are just going to run out of names for these prisons
when the doom music kicks in
Fun fact: Shiratori is the name of his prison, and it is also the name of a Japanese man in the 1940s (Yosie Shiratori) who escaped prison 4 times
Happy Birthday Mythrodak!
end of the video.   Its next......
that intro seemed like a lot of roleplaying... why dont you just press "t" and type "*escapes de prision*"? youre not a clever one are you? dont worry im here to save you.
did u get ur PC
dude, this, was, AWESOME!
RAYS VALT PLZ
The amount of work you put into these videos are truly worth it. I never watch prison videos, but yours amuse me! Keep it up, i love it!
*just fucking jamming (vibing) with the intro music*
And just like that, Mythrodak, current escape artist...   *Became a murderer...*
This guy is the Houdini of minecraft prisons
Litery anyone *makes 'iniscapible' prison or vault* Mythrodak No
The mammoth celsius molecularly curve because pastry recurrently stroke of a bustling bacon. rainy, gabby fork
Happy birthday Mythrodak
That intro tho
Escape Vault 36 and Gaia's vault. my b-day is tomorrow!
Ok first god of water second god of hell and now god of war WHY
I will make you a god damn prison.  I honestly am starting g to get a little pissed of that you always escape and I will build you "odins vault".
Love the suspense and 200 Iq plans in these vids :D
i made my own vault that is run by piglins and is in the nether. the only problem is I made it on bedrock. so i dont know if you would be able to try it
Next video: escaping the firm clutches of virginity with nothing but Rick and Morty references.
Bro you need to teach me
12:48 I kept my jaws open for like 20 mins
Yeahhhh brathdaygh
The guards weren't even logged on because when he was going down u sing the water he placed a sign and the world paused
Happy birthday!
8:15 the time stopped when he placed a sign meaning he was in a single player mode which probably means he faked most of his escapes
Try initiative penitentiary...  Thats a real hard thing to escape
The doom ost fits so well
Having doom music be the theme of this escape was genius
Love the doom music.
the punishment again for a creeper exploding your bed is a prison that is so secure that it is for Mithrodak
Who is going to put him in  a cage of barriers blocks
It’s not a prison, it’s a high court
the "checkmate" at the end was so perfect
THE ENDING WAS EPIC!!!
THE DOOM MUSIC
welp i guess wilbur had a son i guess ;-;
Seensven is back with a better prison... and I think it’s kind of inescapable Edit: good luck
Best cinematic video, keep going, I like this video!
Pls try to escape the garias vault that seenseven made
Where did you get the pickaxe inside the prison?
Mythrodark: Checkmate Me: OH SHI*
Next video: Escaping Alcatraz
0:35 Bruh Mythrodak went Natsuki on us     also im 4 minutes late but happy birthday
I’m about to build Achilles’s court room netlike why isn’t he in court
Noone can contain this guy
I liked when the Doom Eternal music kicked in.
Surely a big bedrock cube is much more safe
Wait, Gaia’s vault is next?!
You can see he got his new pc already by the edits
U ARE AWESOME MYTHRODAK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
For some reason I feel there's like a snake
OOO I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS NEXT EPISODE
what did he do to be put in there
i love how he overpowers the guards
He glitched me into a Aspen dental ad
its also my birthday! amizing vid btw
Ares was the god of war          *but I’m god of escaping*
When u turn and say who's next u seem like a psychopath
News: Local Immortal Interdimensional Criminal escapes prison, nukes the entire place.
Guardians vault!guardians vault!guardians vault!
This prison is hades vault but the doom music started
gias vault what about that boi
this madlad really just challenged everyone like "WHO'S NEXT" xD
Next video: escaping from a bedrock box with just a potato
You are probably smarter than dream
Isn’t the best prison just a person trapped in a bedrock box with a chest of food that gets refilled by guards every week or so
He will be escaping real prisons soon, like the Minecraft ones
u know its serious when the only thing they fear is you is playing
When he didn't need items to break out: It's evolution, just backwards
I always feels like I'm watching prison break when I see a your videos (and they're amazing!) nice job, and happy birthday!!!
How did he get a netherite pickaxe at 10:59? He clearly mentioned that the guard stations didn’t have pickaxes
ares is the best greek god
Your motto should be “if there’s a way to get in, there’s a way to get out”
Happy birthday mythrodak. *You Are a legend*
The story telling is on another level.
yooooo we share the same birthday
12:47 The most badass scene in your videos so far (Happy birthday m8 🙂)
This may sound kinda fangirly but you are literally so cool
Let’s goooooo
This guy always says "so I won't ness around"  *but then 2 minutes later he always goes "i wanna challenge"*  Happy Birthday tho Mythro :D
ah yes, doom music
Mythrodak in 2023: Escaping a prision in real life. Mythrodak in 2025: Escaping a actual real life trapped desert temple.
im impressed how high quality this is and its has so so much care and love and effort put into this
Guard: drops a piece of rotten flesh. Mythrodak: This is more than enough to escape
Your use of doom music was perfection.
It starts at 5:30
sheesh great vid
Happy Birthday!
I literally poged when seeing Gaia's vault
hey dude amazing channel,  have a prison coming soon for u to escape . reply to this comment plz and we can see if u will
Happy Birthday
Anyone builds a prison Mythrodak: how dare you oppose me mortal
Awesome video!
dude, your content is getting quality, fr.
Mythrodak: *obtains oxygen*  Also Mythrodak: and that is all i will need for my escape
Happy birthday Mythrodak I love the editing on your videos looking forward to your next post
Everyone that sees this share this video everywhere this man deserves so many more subs
Bro, how tf do u make escaping a box inside a box game so entertaining??? Great vid, 10/10 would escape cube again.
I have been watching for a bit but for some reason had not subbed
The doom music in the background made the video 10 times better. As a doom fan this is probably my favorite vid.
4 hrs ago
4:51 when the doom music kicks in you know that this man is about to destroy this prison like a piece of cake
Happy birthday but good luck escaping gaia's vault
THE LORE
Happy Birthday Mythrodak!!!
it impossible to escape some of these prisons if your on the dream smp because there would  be no end items
Happy Bday Mythrodac!
better than money heist
dat intro doe
God of Escape Mythrodak escapes again!  Also happy birthday!!!     😶🎉  🎂  🎁🎈
Nice doom music
Using a redstone block to ingite the tnt(if you brought it in your enderchest) would be better since it ignores shields
They should just block him up all in bedrock lol
I like to doom music
This guy's underated
everybody gangsta till MythrodakTV starts speaking greek mythology
There goes the only good name I got for my SMP's prison
When he said ares is the god of war and then the battle music started so I thought HE WAS GONNA PUNCH THE GUARDS AND WARDENS TO DESTH WITH HIS BARE FIST LOL
4:55 when the doom music kicks in
I love your videos! Happy birthday!
shiratori is my favourite
This video didn't need to go as hard as it did lmao
If the equip station only gave Armor, Weapons, etc. How did you get the pickaxe? it would be weird if it was only the wardens since that would take up a dispenser and give them a way to free the guards
when the doom music kicks in:
This is awesome. I’m impressed by this video!
love the doom misuc
Love the etiting very cool like a movie
why does doom tracks fit so well with your vids
Epic, happy bday
By far, this was the most badass escape yet.
He should make this into a movie, THIS IS AMAZING
Why did I subscribe? Not going to lie the over the top b roll and music did it.
In all honesty how long did it take to edit this
The TNT part was sick
The doom music makes it even better
Hold let me listen to doom song while drinking carrot juice
Bro the tnt part was aswome🤩
Wo great job that looks epic
Happy birthday Mythrodak haha oh iv missed this
10:26 where did you get the efficiency V pick from? I thought the guards didn’t have a pick
That was the most PATHETIC and humiliating prison that has tried to capture u
That moment when you realize mythrodak may be more powerful then dream himself
yo gaias vaukt next pog
Bruh the tnt momtage was EPIC
bruh, this was EPIC
You need to be a Dream SMP character.
The only thing i can say is: Chills
Thats incredible! how long does it take you to make one of this Videos? I love your work, just subscribed :D
Happy birthday!! My gift to you is a medieval Minecraft Map that I am building. So I hope you will like it!
Gai’s vault is inescapable
Happy birthday mythrodak:)
Great Gaia's is going down... Soon
What if warden or some guards have  pickaxe in ender chest?
NO WAY DUDE YOUR ACTUALLY THE SMARTEST MINECRAFT PLAYER
ah yes doom music  poggers
Happy birthday Mythrodak
This has to be one of your best ones. SO COOL. Also I get the reference with Shitatori, the guy who broke out of all the prisons in Japan he was in during the Second World War (except the one he didn’t want to). Maybe there is an ending to this saga where you don’t break out of  one, not because you can’t because you don’t want to? Just a thought.
waiting for the moment when all the comunity tries to make a prision and MythrodakTV just break out with 500IQ
Mythrodakin 2069 : Hi guys today we are escaping from earth
Mythrodak: who's next  Me: Guardians valt
When you use glitches to get Mythrodak trapped in bedrock 👀
Hi
It is to easy fake touching the bed
It isn’t pronounced air ez its are ez ;(
happy birthday!!! idk if this is true but i think you got your new pc bc minecraft is a lot smoother and you videos are just better quality. so congrats!!!
I'm just happy with pressure plate trapdoor traps thank you
LORE???
Editing pog
I know I’m knit picking but I thought you said that the guards don’t get pickaxes and you didn’t get a pickaxe from your e chest  Did you get a pickaxe from creative
The intro want to me throw my phone
When That Doom Music Kicks In
funny why cant the guards have pickaxes but you an enderchest full with tnt obsidian flint and steels and totem but i dotn want to hate you your videos are still one of the best videos on yt
I NEVER KNEW OF THIS??? IS THIS A CHALLENGE???
YESSSSSSS
that will teach the builders a lesson DON'T USE ANYTHING EXEPT OBI IN THE INSTIDE OF THE PRISON!!!!! and don't leave E-Chests there to
Probably my favourite video so far, also happy birthday Mythro, keep it up and hope you are doing well in these times
sheeeeesh the ending finally this prison
That ending tho, he makes this so overdramatic now, remember his older escaping videos? Where it wasn't overdramatic
Except like 90% of the fortress is obsidian...
This guy is 1000 IQ, also HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!
this man shall be contained
Gaia's vault next...:)
where tf did he get the pick from 10:26?
DOOM!
We found the new dream
If someone makes one more prison with "vault" inside I'm gonna lose it
Best birthday gift ever xd
no hate but how did you just suddenly get a netherite pickaxe when you called the guards?
It’s amazing how mythrodak has made a successful minecraft career on such a small niche  and has grown a huge fan base, I’m sure you will do well in the future!
It looks like the famous Hill Valley clock tower building
My dad just shat in my pants
Happy bday
You know it's getting real when there's doom music
Jesus Christ, these editing skills are amazing!
Shiratori? As in Yoshie Shiratori?!
Damn your starter then dream
4:52 when the DOOM music kicks in…
Damn the music be poggers
GIGACHAD:  Walks out of the GUARD ROOM, IN A PRISON,  Fully equiped
Greco/Roman Gods: *exist* Minecraft Prison Builders: *it's free real estate*
When the doom music kicks in
Mythrodak is the coolest guy ever. Like, that tnt bit at the end was AWESOME. And then when he said “Checkmate” that just made me like him even more. Great job man, can’t wait to see what’s next.
Early
Okay, so...hear me out on my command block argument, Mythrodak. What if...WHAT IF?! This was built on 2b2t. There is a solid chance of ITristan having some command blocks, and if he doesnt have them, he can get them. Just convince him to give you a command block and its golden.

Oh boy oh boy I can make the ultimate prison without using any commands nor any redstone and it still will be inescapable
i like how everybody thinks he could escape all these prisons when he mostly relies on stupidity of the guards or cheats with prep time you normally dont have and if he doesnt, its a flaw in the system that the prison builders made, that could be easily fixed. next would be that he always exactly knows the prison block for block which means some of his methods wouldnt be replicable if just one simple detail in the prison was changed if one of these was built on a server and the biggest problem is how no one seems to know how to correctly build prisons that are inescapable, especially after they learned what they have to change/include in a prison from mythrodak.
birthday  escape pog?
bro i f**kin love that doom soundtrack holt s**t (im not sure if people swear in the comments so ima not)
Sun Tzu’s vault
"checkmate" -Mythrodak 2021
Meanwhile Mythrodak 10 years later: Escaping  A bedrock prison enforced with 100 bedrock layers!
this was one of the biggest cliffhangers yet..
Hello I have a new prison Humid’s  Vault. It is on Bedrock and it does work with bedrock but the glitch in survival can break it so ya. Add me as a friend (Johnsonpeter).
HELL YEAH LETS GO DOOM
We are 5 minutes in and my mans here just shredded the whole prison
This is BY FAR one of the most interesting escapes that he has done, it required a lot of ingenuity and skill compared to many of his other escapes that are usually take less time but also fewer steps.
Happy Birthday Mythrodak!
Another banger
the doom music was a fantastic touch
the story omg
Daym that was epic at the end
This would make a fun comic
I can now say I share my birthday with Mythrodak, POG!
This man gives me big Mamamax vibes
*GIVE THIS MAN 10M SUBS RN*
where bankers vault XD
also if there was a dedicated group of people that had a trapped team mate and they were anarchists then this prion is completely useless
Happy Birthday bro, you are such a good youtuber, i didnt know youtube videos could be THIS good quality, in terms of scripting, editing, etc. Hope you have a good one and keep making amazing videos!
wow....this video is so cinematic ! Oh damn , you madlad , you actually escaped this prison and made an entertaining video. I loved it ! Can’t wait for more. Btw , I’m glad you used DOOM music.
bruh the ending is the best minecraft cinematic ever
Gaurdians voult
Not Gia’s vault
Can you try gaias vault
“Checkmate” that actually gave me chills
Happy birthday
I’m subscribed  and you are the best at escaping prisons.
all these flaws are very fixable and wont take long to make the prison ACTUALLY inescapable
The doom Music is a nice touch
all theese prisen r pethetic (*evil laghter*) time to make 1 even better *evil laghter*
Happy birthday
Prison: _Exists_  Mythrodak: 0_o
What war crimes did this man do to keep getting locked up
What has been the hardest to escape in your opinion
oh my god you know about 30% of players actually turn up there gamma to 1000 for better visuals and it basically looks like its day time everywhere the plan is slightly flawed, but if by chance all guards and the warden don't have there gamma turned up then your all gud, but it is quite unlikely
Your editing is amazing (:
Minecraft's deadliest prison... not by design, just because I filled it with nitroglycerin on the way out
Eventually they will run out of Greek names to name the prisons
i cant process how smart you are, also happy birthday! :)
They should make a prison called the matrix
break out of the dream smp prison I DARE YOU
Soon my good sir, soon the prison I'm making will be truly unbreakable. Happy birthday my friend
"unfortunatley they have let me keep my soul, which is all I need"
when the doom music kicks in:
Can literally ant prison hold him
Is there a copy of Ares Vault? Because uh if there isn't I fell really bad for the creators.
I love the doom music
EPIC
Yo now I wanna create a vault to be part of the series
Happy birthday, Mythrodak
everyone playing minecraft while this man playing deathnote
I like how it went from improving Pandora's vault to trying and make a prison mythodak(i mite thro my dak)=(i mite throw my duck) can't escape
Blow it up hahaha funny
Every time you amaze me more
The next prison is literally a Volcano. It better be called Typhon's Chamber.
Little side note even though my prison is on bedrock I legitimately think it would be impossible to escape
Will be watching out for his new video.  escaping my uncle’s basement
“I don’t know how much time I have left”    *Proceeds to spend hours filling every room with TNT*
God this was amazing, especially from a cinematic perspective
GAIAS VAULT
Next: i escaped the simulation with a strip of newspaper
LOVE your videos!
doom music now huh? nice
itathe music and the ambiance for me
Casually vibes to doom music
Mythrodak's Next Video: Escaping The SuperMax, America's most inescapable prison.
Myrhrodak's mind during this: I big brain I steal their most valuable items  I escape I start a war by blowing up the prison    He has big brain
It won't let me add a reply so Happy Birthday Mythrodak!
how subscribing to mythrodakTV works: click big button number gets B I G G E R mythrodak get big happy more videos appear
That ending was amazing
This was so intense XD
try the kingstone next plsss
Intro music
Happy Birthday :) <3
Nice doom music
im not even gonna  cap this is the best video ive ever seen
YOOOO I SHARE THE SAME BIRTHDAY AS MYTHRODAK POOOOG
Doom 2016 music, nice!
I subbed is mythrodak big happy
Hold up, how did you get a pickaxe? You said the guards didn’t have 1 and plus there wasn’t one in your ender chest?
When you hear doom eternal's soundtrack it is like sending some kind of signals that are making me like the video.😉
bruh he show how fast he can escape a prison like this in 10 seconds   (sorry for the bad english, I’m Brazilian)
5:11 : when doom music kicks in
The only problem I have with the awesome videos is you have schematics of the prison that’s how you were able to find out where the warden pearl stasis redstone was
Happy Birthday!! My present to you is a new subscriber
Happy b-day for gift i will send you a prision that you cant escape easily
CHECKMATE
Dude the lore tho
I’m starting to think what this man did to keep getting captured by these prisons
Alt Title Wanted Man Escapes Prison Then Commits Arson
Watching Mythrodaks videos is like watching a movie trailer
You cheated In 2 ways because you said you didn’t prepare you ender chest and also you said the guards/Wardens don’t have a pickaxe so yeah.
what a ending lol
Why r u so smart
do gaurdians vault
LOVE the Mr Robot vibes gj man!
Mythrodak: *starts playing doom music*  Me: ohhhh yeah shit's about to go down
Mythrodak, we all want the answer-   Is there such a thing as an inescapable prison?
1000 iq
Jeeze! Tnt was... Actually a very good choice. Well done.
Why would I rather watch this in a cinema rather than any other movie
_checkmate_  -fucking blows up
We need to get this man on the dream smp as Sam’s arch rival
he literally came out of that prison better than he went in
That checkmate line at the end sounded and looked so epic
glad you have new PC you really deserve it, also the ending was really good!
Bruh imagine  MythrodakTV on the dream smp lol
Ngl that tnt part was better than most movies I have seen
do your next one without knowing the layout of the prison because it is easy that way
GOSH DARNIT my prison is the exact premise of this one, On a platform out over a void, I thought I had a new idea but someone beat me to it🤣
happy bday Mythrodak, enjoy your day! Btw, wth how do you make such amazing cinematics and how do you think about this escape plans lmao  PS: The problem of this prisons is the bed traps and the redstone. Just do a obsidian cage with mining fatigue 3, and guards 24/7. Everytime you break a block, they replace it. Inescapable
Happy Birthday!
The editing is amazing! This is your best video by far!
Mythrodak. You can’t break out of this prison  .....Doom music starts to play.....
This. Is. Incredible
Mate your videos bang
This is netflix but better
Mythrodak, your videos never fail to impress me
Mythrodak: I won't be smuggling items or killing myself Translation: This prison is so easy I wanted to make it a challenge
Jeez your production quality is exceptional as always. I see your videos and wish there were more because watching them is so enjoyable
Dude, amazing video, love the editing and music. Keep up the amazing work!
Happy birthday
Best escape yet
WHEN THE DOOM MUSIC KICKS IN
I love how this minecraft prison trend has quickly evolved from people trying to make better versions of the dream smp prison to a whole communty franticly trying to contain mythrodak. This channel is a gold mine
Yo I'm glad there's an option in gta where u don't kill Trevor or Michael, Cia
happy birthday and congrats on escaping
The fact that he used the doom eternal ost put a huge smile on my face.
Finally I’m so happy 1080p is here
It’s all fun and games till the doom music kicks in
Your best video yet! Mythrodak haunts people’s dreams
This guy is so sick
DO GAIAS VAULT ALREADY REEEEEEEEEE
In 15 years: escaping Earth's only prison surrounded by the entire military and lasers everywhere.
Happy birthday 🎉
mythrodak really likes his doom music
happy birthday
oaky I subbed I forgot lol
vault 36
I love you for using doom music  And the editing is just absolutely amazing U deserve more subs
bro checkmate is such a awesome kill line
6:45 But why would there be wood there and not obsidian ?
hes not thinking outside the box, *hes become the box*
BESTIE THAT WAS SO COOL
achievement get, HELL YEAH BROTHER: say something duke Nukem would say over the doom soundtrack achievement get,  feel funny: get rufied achievement get, athiest: escape 3 prisons named after gods
Vibing to the doom eternal music though
I love the Doom music
Where did he get the pick
“Command blocks can’t be used in survival” *Proceeds to use commands*
mythrodak doesnt escape anymore, HE MAKES IT GO BOOM BAYBE
Mythrodak is no human he is a genius with what he planned out
Boom
I <3 ur vids SO much and your music choice is THE BEST!
THAT TNT END WAS SO BAD ASS!!!
YESSS GAIA’S VAULT NEXT
You know what? You seem to know how to escape from lots of the most inescapable prisons. So, you if you can escape so well from them, why not build one?
The best part is when he says checkmate 12:46
This all started when someone wanted to make a prison that can keep dream more secure
this is the coolest thing ever
This dude is just insane
The dislikes are the guards
*Checkmate*    the best quote of the entire video
Happy birthday 🥳
Doom music let's goooooo
The facecam videos will be... interesting... due to the nature of your content xD
got ur better pc pog
Happy Birthday
3:43 Mythrodak: -_-  Mythrodak: well if that’s how you wanna play then I will violate your prison like no other prison 4:51 JJkay03: *why’s the doom music playing?* 10:25 Mythrodak: Look how the tables have turned around 11:48 Mythrodak: You said that I can try to escape this prison.... well I’m also trying to blow it up
They didn't even let him do his intro this time wow
🤯🤯🤯🤯💀💥🔥
Happy bday man and keep up the great work
10:25 where did you get the pickaxe from?
When the doom soundtrack kicks in
They r going to run out of Greek gods and menacing names eventually......
Dude they're going to run out of Olympian Gods soob
brilliant as always
OMG GAIAS VAULT
I'm surprised noone has used the bedrock from the nether roof and floor or the overworld floor.  What do y'all think, would that be a good idea?
12:47  Catchphrase of the century
Why go to the cinema when you can just watch this video
happy birthday
The doom music
Your videos are amazing keep doing what your doing
Check please
I love this
You should try escaping Gallia’s vault
Mythrodak has to give his captors command blocks to even give them a chance
THiS IS SO FRIKIN COOL!!!
I love the theme
Is that doom music in the background  It is 4:28 has the only thing they fear is you
Nice video
This might be your best vid yet bro keep it up
Yes let the destruction begin
everyone gangsta until gaia's vault
When your in a server with mythrodak and DOOM music kicked in:  -_-  0_0
i can barely see anything
YOO MythrodakTV, YOURE SO INCREDIBLY GOD DAYUM INSANE! YOUR VIDEOS ARE EXPONENTIALLY GETTING BETTER AND BETTER!! GREAT JOB AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY! Love your I’ll sense of humor as well.
Thank you for using Doom music. It made the video a million times better.
How close are you to escaping Gaia's vault?
Is this a Mr. Robot reference or all your videos are like that? I haven't noticed until now lol, but i like it
7:23 There is no way they can find me exept mining using his fist 10:58 Use an netherite pickaxe
Happy b-day Mythrodak!
U fools u can't defat mythrodak
incredible , my favorite part was the end.
Guards:*brings their own pickaxes or keeps one in ender chest* Mythrodak:;-;
Doom soundtrack perfectly fits, you are master of editing
Wait ares is a less powerful god than Poseidon than how is ares vault better?
"checkmate" BRO UR LITERALLY THE QUIET KID JEEZ
The ending was pog
Damn, the ending was awesome 😎  Also, HAPPY B-day Mythrodak!!!
He said checkmate from call of duty ghost
I love how these escapes have turned into a big story, of Mythrodak being a wanted criminal, travelling with his parrot companion trying to avoid capture, but still escaping anyway he can.
Happy BD,  I love youre vids but how did you get a pickaxe when you said the guards didn’t have one. Because of that you would have less time to actually place tnt and break a lot of blocks with youre hands while the guards just have to break one (ender pearl). The escape you could have made but the tnt not really, but it made it pretty cool non the less
YOOOOO FINNALYYYYYY
That end seen brilliant
Lol what a long intro
The doom music was pog
Man showed two ways to escape this he should get more subs
10000 years from now: I escaped the 4th dimensional United States Penitentiary, Administrative Maximum Facility with 70 Navy Seals Hunting me down while the prison is under water
I am convinced the world will end if this dude can’t escape one of the prisons he gets put in
Thank you for the doom music
Happy birthday
These videos are only geting better and better..
How did you get the pickaxe it wasn’t in the ended chest or the armor equip station
Happy Birthday
Where did  your pixaxe come from
happy birthday Mythrodak :)
11:30 he said the guards had no picx axes and some how he got one from the prison
Have a nice birthday and ESCAPE THE GAİAS VAYLT
13:21 you are not gonna escape that they have infinite ban machines with books and sulked boxes that ban you b cas of loading too much information you cant do it
The amazing editng style and well shot scenes makes this awesome to watch- holy (and also happy birthday)
Happy birthday
Escape azkaban irl :)
DAMNNNN the quality of this content is just getting better
thanks for destroying my ears lol
Make a normal video nah make a cinematic master piece
Does anyone notice these aren't built in survival? People make better prisons than pandoras vault but IT WAS BUILT IN **SURVIVAL** MODE!
If this dude broke out of a real prison and blew it up he'd be charged with a western terrorism crime.
How to get on Mythrodax's channel: 1. Make a big ass "inescapable" prison with a whole lotta redstone 2. Name it (insert greek god name)'s vault 3. Post it on YT 4. Wafch you and your prison get feaured on the channel
somebody has a new pc
YOOOOO THIS IS SO EPIC
DOOM MUSIC, hell yeah
i like the music, its cool
i love how every single escaping prison video has its own little roleplay / lore into it, golly good show
He's saving gaias vault for last
Happy Birthday, Mythrodak!
me watching this on tv and my mom walks in when the base drop starts:ITS NOT WHAT YOU THINK
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Not even Mythrodak can escape Gaia’s vault
Damn that is an amazing intro ngl
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MYTHRODAK!!!!!! also when you said Checkmate at the end that was the dopest line ever.
You used bfg division as music I just know the song from the start
4:45 idk why but theres something insanely badass about how hes explaining how to escape it like its nothing, and itll only be hard with commands lmao
Happy birthday mythrodak!!!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
mythrodak at video end: you know whats next
Dude the content is so great and cinematic. Every time I get a notifications stoked I hope everyone drops a sub because this is top notch
you used doom eternal music (also happy birthday).
Where did you get the pickaxe from?
That doom music doe
Best vid yet
Where Gigas Vault coward
Went from murderer to master prison escapist
It has no guardians bc LAG
This was the most insane escape video I have ever seen
Wait he named his parrot Shiratori which is the name of a famous Japanese prisoner that escaped 3 prisons I think? Coincidence?
Try to escape the Kingston
Mythrodak doesn’t make videos...He makes movies
Happy birthday
Imagine you can catch him because you forgot to have pickaxes
He escaped richer lol
For fucks sake will people stop making "gods vaults" it's such a boring name at this point
That doom music hitting hard
How to escape the simulation tutorial pls 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!
This guy really knows how to make a scene, like I was so hyped up with the intro
“Checkmate”
Im starting to question wether gaias vault is escapable or not :/
Happy birthday! Your vids are awesome
couldn't you simply create a button instead of a redstone torch so as to not create the beacon of light
The ending was brutal.
He cheated and I can prove it he said the guards did not have pickaxes but later after he went in the armory he had a pickaxe and it was not from the ended chest to see the pickaxe he has go  to 10:35  So mythrodak if you would like to explain yourself please comment on the post of explain in your next video
Ok, but how is no-one talking about how fitting the doom eternal music is
How do your videos not get copyrighted claimed for the DOOM soundtrack as the background music, is it copyright free or am I missing something?
Speechless, fret not I will find a way… I will find a way to trap this beast
This is awesome.
When the doom music kicks in 4:27
My birthday gift to u is subscribing! Great content. <3
Hmmm i wonder if he would be somehow able to escape without any preparation seeing the prison for the first time in his life
This man is the reason I dont wanna make prisons lol
Everybody gangsta untill Mythrodak breaks out of Gaea's Vault with nothing but a stale bagel
I think Mytrodak is becoming evil or something
This is the coolest one so far
Imagine a minecraft SMP were its wardens vs escapees and Mythrodak is the escapees leader/trump card
This would be impossible on bedrock because you can’t shift in water but, MY GOD WHEN IS SOMEONE GOING TO TRAP YOU?
Mythrodak: *mocks the guards for not having pickaxes* Also Mythrodak: *doesn't have a pickaxe on his ender chest*
Try gaias vault
Do gaias vault next
even if it was in the video i just know the last thing the guards heard was (of course the tnt exploding until hitting them but also) doom music the entire time
when doom music
omggg this was so cool
So next would be: demeters vault, Heras vault, apollos vault, athenas vault and maybe Tartarus vault. (Ive read percy jackson like 500 times lol  EDIT sorry i forgot about Artemis' vault
Like how u using doom music
dude this vid is epic
try gaias vault
We all know the greatest prison is a 10 by 10 by 10 bedrock box
And Gaia's vault?
I am making a valut
I'm intrigued by the Lore for this Mythrodak Universe
Happy birthday <3
13:15 cant fucking wait for this
Ares is a God of war however Is often depicted as the bad part of war However Athena is the Greek Goddess of War and Wisdom in most cases also talented in crafts so Athena's Prison of some sort should be Even Harder
The tnt edit at the end made me sub xD
doom music kicks in parts r so cool
You know, If this was realistic. how would you have no-clipped to see inside the walls lol.
happy birthday!
Wow nearly 200 k I’ve been since 5 k
someone get this man a Washing Machine
the doom music made me subscribe
What a badass way to end the video, nice!
now its lore time babyy
this is one of the sickest and most cinematic videos yo
13:26 Gias Vault? :D
Mythrodak: Who's next? Me: Your next challenger, is Gains Vault, good luck, but you won't need it, ;)
good video
Haha your never gonna get out of this one. *guard turns back for 1 second*.. *Oh your gonna be her for a long time. * *turns around* so what do you thi--    *Mythrodak is gone* *Ah sh*t here we go again*
Happy birthday mythrodak Best wishes
My man is trying to get the death penalty
I swear... the editing, the camera angles, the music, the style. Myth, you were born to make youtube videos
Anyone know the music for when he is walking down the hallway in full armour
But... how did you get the pickaxe???
Can any place contain this guy or no?
Happy birthday
I want this man to be in dream smp I’m surprised he isn’t already
where are you from? also happy bday
Have they not considered bedrock
Excellent video
The editing in this video is so amazing! I’m amazed how much you’ve changed since you started making prison videos!      And of course, happy birthday mythrodak!
LETS GOOOOO THTA WAS INSANE
Idk why but the last part where he said checkmate was so badass
He uses a pickaxe in his footage. But still a Excellent prison escape
If it's a fight you want, it's a fight you'll get.  -Juan
His iq is over 9000
Minecraft explosions have never looked this cool
i love the music and this is you best escape yet !!!!
Has anyone else questioned why everyone wants to put Mythrodak is prison? All he does is escape prison he doesn't even commit crimes
Anyone else wondering why all these are named after Greek gods?
God this could be an entire movie.
Solution: disconnect
I love the doom music xd
Ight, GAIA's vault is next But how?
Gaia's vault yeeeeeeeeessssssss
holly shit you keep 1uping every single time also happy birthday you got 1 year closer to death
This video is hype at the end
Dude its so cool how you used to do normal vids but now they're like cinematic movies :D
Spooky movie-like editing gets better by every video! I love it!
This video is so good!
CHECKMATE      BOOM
this should be a movie
happy birthday mine is on the 25 june i realy like ur short movie like parts between everything i. think. there realy good thx alot
0:58 that name sounds familiar... like prisonner yotchiey chiratorie from the incredible Japanise prison break by Kento Bento
Mythrodaktv to the creators of the prison: “think fools think, you thought you could contain me?”
Heck. Yes.
С днем рождения! (Happy birthday in russian)
Happy birthday
If there was a zombie apocalypse I would be sure to take this man with me
How many prisons are going to be named after Greek gods
5:10 when the doom music kicks in
Bruh how do you get a pickaxe when the guards didn’t have it
I was listening to the doom eternal ost before the vid. So I thought I broke YouTube and managed to have the other video's audio play while this video's audio also played lol
Damn bro 2:18 that's a lotta editing
gotta love how these are full on cinematics
Too bad mythrodak only escapes the prisons that look good
damn thats a pretty enthusiastic voice 😐
These videos just keep getting better and better!
Happy bday Myth! The vid quality is even better than usual!!
This is a perfect example of how the maker was lazy and ended up making his prison worse 🤣
Also happy B day man
It’s time. To prove your skill to find your capture… you must beat Gaea’s vault. To this I wish you good luck. Now go Mythrodak.
literally- a lot more people need to know about him.
How did U get the pickaxe BC in equip station wasn't U said and in your enderchest either so how did U get it
Not to be rude but the guest that was talking, in the beginning, had a terrible mic and completely threw me off and ruined my immersion. Just some feedback don't take it as hate pls
I wonder if you can fake clicking a bed
I just love Mythrodak also HAPPY BIRTHDAY
WHO'S NEXT?  YOU DECIDE!
u should do it so the parrot get stuck and u go in and save it in a new prison or old prison just thought that would be cool
MAN THIS EPISODE WAS SOOO COOL AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY MYTHRODAK!!!!!
I felt like I got 30 IQs more clever by watching this
I wanna see you escape one fully in survival with actual guards trying to stop you
I love the way these videos are made omg
Happy Birthday!!! Also will you try escape Gaia’s vault?
hi, ur videos r really inspiring, i have even started to build a prison that is completly  based on all the ones feuatred in ur vids thx
This dude is 100x smarter than everyone in the entire if the world!
Plot twist: nothing
everybody gangsta till there are no more greek gods for vault names
Ah shit, here we go again
Guys, who wants to keep putting Demi-gods in prison?
I love how he makes a story to every video
this is the only prison where not only does mythrodak escape, but he also gets maxed netherite gear, meaning he actually profited from going into this prison
I hate all the 12 year olds in these comments lol
Gaias Vault is next?! Whne is the balck hole prisions turn? TLDR, don't taunt MythrodakTV, he'll destroy you!
Yo!! the music is from tds from roblox lol
With your new pc these will get even better!!
Just a suggestion if your going to do the memory flashes again you should add "a couple of flashing lights" or something similar in the title or at the beginning of the video
I realized that this has become an actual series. Not just an escape guide, but it’s actually Mythro fleeing the FBI now.
Forgot how good doom music is
this guy deserves way more subs and views... what a vid!
Why did he sound like wille woka when he said there was tnt everywhere
can u show it again but with fullbright, i couldnt see a thing
He done it again
bruh just put bedrock around
Stop giving dream ideas on how to escape pandoras prison plz.
0:35 when the mythrodak is sus
plot twist : mythrodak is actually an irl prison escapee
Nothing encapsulates my interest like these videos my god
doom music <3
when the doom soundtrack hits btw congrats
Happy birthday
How did you get the pickaxe if the guards don’t have it
Happy birthday
When the doom music starts
Happy Birthday!
DOOM MUSIC!!!!
With this guy’s smarts on these prisons, he should build his own
Imagine subscribing, liking the video and turning on post notifications to make Mythro big happe  couldn't be me
I love how the name "Ares" is being used more. I've been using it for years and mostly everyone didn't know the name.
TRY ESCAPING THE GULAG
all prision are super easy so he puts challenges lol
Ok so this is the best one
Bruh, great
._. EPIC! HAPPY BIRTHDAY TOO! ALSO CONGRATS ON 190K!
Cannot believe how easy you made it out to be escaping with mining fatigue. lol, rip another 'inescapable' prison
I hear doom music I click like
The best escape artists Harry Houdini  Dorothy Dietrich Jonathan Goodwin Roslyn Walker David Blaine Mythrodak
I like how you add a little bit of lore in the begging and at the end of the video!
Best prison in bedrock edition is literally bedrock, bc in bedrock you actually can obtain, bedrock, through glitches. You can get encased in bedrock, fed no food, a 1x1x2 case, no way to die. Bedrock edition is hardcore
This video was just UNBELIEVABLE
The prison is obviously amazing, but why would they call it Ares vault? Ares is the god of war, and he always takes no prisoners because he kills them all. Nothing that important, but I thought I’d mention it
Mythrodak pulls an uno reverse card on every very secure prison that he finds He turns into the guard while the guards turn into the prisoners
It felt so cool! like a movie or like a super villan plan!!!
Happy birthday :D
In today's episode I found another better prison when will I find 1 that's unbeatable
gaia's vault!?
love the ending
YAAAAY
Do gaias vault
Happy birthday
The doom music is heat
what an ending!
What have you done getting trapped in every prison in this world?
Inb4 mythro escapes the confines of social morality.
You deserve a gift too I hope you will reach 1 million subs in your next birthday
These videos have more lore than the dream smp
@13:16 GAIA'S VAULT
Imagine Being the prison maker and your prison gets beaten like this 4:31
I don’t want to subscribe but if I like the next video I will
I can’t wait for guardians vault
What was the last scene? Was that a leak of the next video?
Bro but there are guardians, that would take a life
Starting to think mythrodak is on NZT
the end was epic
Happy birthday!
Checkmate is the next super hero line
Ok the checkmate part was cool
Gg
Happy Birthday Mythrodak i subbed when u had like 2 k i really like ur content
When Gaia’s vault
i like it when mythrodak big hapi
Happy Birthday Mythrodak!
“If it’s a war they want.... it’s a war they will get.” -MythrodakTV
Have a nice birthday! Love your content man
Happy birthday btw
Happy birthday Mythrodak Congrats on the escape  Good luck fro Gaias vault.
You should escape the prison while they are hunting you like u make a plan and then u try it while they try to stop u
You should escape the most compact secure prison
When the doom music kicks in.
I cant watch thus I have my 2 hr math class in the morning So bye BUT I WILL WATCH THIS MARK MY WORDS
Bruh I already made this :/ I didn’t show it to anyone, but I did lol
happy bday bro! ur content is awesome
My favorite Greek god and it still has vault in the name
Mythrodak: So today were going to escape Alcatraz without our limbs in just ten minutes
I will just say good luck on Gaia’s Vault Myth
Everybody gangsta until Mythrodak says "That's all I need"
Good vid, but mate u take yourself way too seriously, I mean it’s just funny to see this well shot and voiced video over footage of minecraft
Happy Birthday Mythrodak!  Warden: “This is your Birthday Gift.” Mythrodak: “This is my birthday presentto give to you”: blows up the prison
Doom music really makes it good
I love the idea of using their own statis chambers against them
Happy Birthday
"Ares was the god of war, and if its a war they want, its a war they will get"
Normal prison to him is a daycare
as long as mythrodak lives there is no unescapable prison
The way you told us to sub seems quite effective. More people should try it. Especialy since with most youtubers, you have very little reason to sub to get a notifications you arent going to watch just because they told you to press it. Its not like the like button. Prob why the stat strategy worked
Prison builders be like: Shit there are not much more gods left to name prisons.
So all the prisons are just neighbors built right next to each other? Huh
The escape feels like such an actual prison escape where you dig through walls an disable switches and stuff then get the guards gear its so well made GGS
love the intro
Cactus
“Checkmate”
Ayo these builders are gonna run out of god names real soon
Going hard with the doom music!
The "Mythrodak is big Happy" image will forver scar me, maybe he can use that as an escape method, show it to the guards and they become frozen in fear, giving him unlimited time.
Omg you hit 190 k like 10 sec ago im watching vid 2 hour after uplaod
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The first rule of design  The more complex you make it the more ways it has to break So yea make it simple you morron architekts dont solve by addition solve by subtraktion
When the DOOM music kicks in
me:watching all mythrodaks escaping vids - when im trapped in minecraft prison:my time has come
Ok
i love how hes like i could just do this "cuts to him breaking out in 10 seconds" but thats boooooring
if i remember correctly u cant break obsidian with tnt.. oopsie
When will we get zagreus' cardboard box
can you escape Gaia's vault
I don’t get why people are so serious about a block game. I love it
adopt me
Minecraft community: Why can't you just be normal? Mythrodak: *Screams*
Never seen a more badass channel about minecraft 🤣
He didnt just escape the prison, he escaped in style lol
4:58 most badass line ever
Next prison idea: obsidian box where 7 guards are watching you 24/7 Impossible right?
Mythrodak, we're suposted to give you gifts, not you to us
Happy b day
People can make these prisons more and more elaborate but everyone knows that the best prison is a box with multi layer thick bedrock walls
the doom song fits soo well i love your editing skills and also happy brithday
Happy birthday!
You asking for subscribers worked, damn it now the button is grey
Doom soundtrack be like
dis man destroys the prison, get fully stacked with gear, and escapes, what a god
When are you escaping Gaia’s vault
bro the doom music fit perfectly with the vid
BRO THIS VIDEO IS INSANE
Shiratori is proud
The ending was just hardcore
5:10 “When the DOOM music kicks in”
You are so underrated, i culd definitely see you being on the dream smp
Day 696969696969420420420 of telling mythrodak to just do his time
The parrots name is Shiratori, as in Yoshie Shiratori?
Dude this video is sooo good! it feels like watching a movie!
What crime did you do? That make them have to make all this stuff...
Happy Birthday Mythrodak! :)
DUDE! Your production quality is INSANE!!! NICE JOB DUDE!
These videos are edited so well
Demoman
Hey it’s my vault
Doom music? Nice!
You might be the coolest and smartest Minecraft YouTuber I know
I love youre style of making vids
Damn he always gives me chills with the punch lines and music in the back
Sick
Cmon, just get some bedrock from drista and put this man in a bedrock box
Happy birthday:)!
I will quote TheRussianBadger: "this man has a smart pistol for a mouth,he doesnt miss"
Judging from the music, I think you like Doom
The commentary on this is so amazing. Happy birthday by the way hope it's good
Happy Birthday my guy hope you have an amazing day. Great video btw
I just watch for the plot
Happy birthday! Love your videos, no prison can hold this man
You know what would make this prison unescapable? Instead of having a giant obsidian pit they could just have used a glitch to break bedrock and put the cell above the void.  It would make it impossible to "overstress" the redstone ore and it can be done in survival.
happy birthday mythrodak
Happy bday
The perfect prison escape dont exi-
sus
when the DOOM music kicks in
Dude, these things aren't prisons, they are vaults now
5:20 THE DOOR WHY WHY WHY     *Amogus*
what on earth did mythrodak commit to be locked in all these prisons?
Here it comes, «the dooms day prison» as I would call the prison which was showed as last, it can ban everyone in the prison if prisoner escapes and guards know that :))) that will be fun to watch
He should be in a movie and I’m VERY intimidated btw when he says checkmate it sounds so badass
Happy birthday
My gift is subscribing to you so happy birthday!
UR TO CRAZY TO BE ALIVE LOL
bro this is like anime of the decade matirial shti here
bruh get this guy to 1mil subs RIGHT NOW
Cool
jesus christ this is so well made
Watch the next one be zeus’ vault
I bet before this year finishes he would escape all the greek god prisons
MAKE A MOVIE
Happy birth day Legend
What’s next? Hercules’ prison/vault? Also, Happy B-Day
happy birthday man
Frickin love the doom music throughout
Happy birthday Rodak!
Guard drops mythrodak a potato Mythrodak: “and that was all I needed to escape”
Are going to ignore that he showed how to escape in like 2 seconds the went "that he would be boring so I'm making this harder"
What was the other prison that you see at the end?
What crime did you commit?
The most bad ass vid in YouTube
Next: escaping greek vault
Mythrodak’s videos will be 100x more badass with Lupins songs
Ares Vault, Hades Vault, Poseidons Vault. Hmmmm... Im starting to see a patern i dont like...
Happy bday!
Hbd
Man love the doom music great choice but like what about copyright?
The only thing that fear is Mythrodak escaping Jesus  vault
5:12 when the doom music kicks in
Doom music starts to play
Last time it was god of war music, this time it is doom music  this dude has good taste
This is so needlessly over the top I love it so much XD
The best 1 yet !!!!
Ha so u can’t escape Gias vault lol
I was so sad to see the video end
Congratulations for surviving for a revolution is the sun
GG happy b dayuu
I originally wanted to watch prison break, but this is better
why is everyone making prisons?
Love how he is escaping every prison exept for the new one by SevenSens
No one gonna talk about how he magically got a pickaxe?
You deserve more subs
When Doom music kicks in.
Incredible video, this is better than a movie for real !
You should try to escape Gaia’s vault
I think you are a really youtober not becuse of your contend or qualitiy (witch are good) but you dont do like making peaple subscribe and teling them that every 10 seconds and other stuff
This guy knows how to make an action movie.
That little disclaimer letting us know was sickkk
Poggers birthday
Happy birthday! Also want to say this was EPIC the tnt explosion was brilliant
I want to see Gaia's Vault next.
happy bday
Good choice with the doom music😈👌
The DOOM music is exactly what prison builders hear whenever Mythordak starts making a video on their prison
By far the best and most dramatic escape yet. Great job on this one, and Happy Birthday
Happy birthday mythrodak  But u said that the guards armor equip chamber does not have a pickaxe but how did u got one
Happy birthday my man
Are you too scared for Gaia’s vault? If not THEN ESCAPE IT
Next prison the warden has left me with air but that’s all i need
Happy Birthday ;)
Somebody: MY PRISION IS THE BEST ONE this guy:(' -')
Happy bday
Happy birthday Mythrodak!!
Best. Video. Ever.
Hapoy birth day mythrodak! (I dont was in time to comment in ur comment)
My birthday gift to to MythrodakTV is subscribing to you.
HAPPY BIRRTHDAY
How come every time a new prison is made Mythrodak is just like "not only is it huge its also the most secure in the world" but he escapes priisons one after another
The "checkmate" was the most badass thing in this video. Amazing.
5:08 when the doom music kicks in
5:10 12:48 When the doom music kicks in
YOOOOO the editing and music fit so well also this its very similar to an action movie or some thing like that, well done! also happy bday
Dude... i love the doom music and the mortal kombat reference
Tbh i want to be an anarchist in minecraft games with a prison system like this just give me a custom nuke from hbms and i can create a nuke of hell fire i destroyed a large 1/4 of my world with that hell fire of a nuke
I've seen every single one of these videos now I want to make a vault that you can't escape. it appears most the time that the Redstone is too close to the walls easily accessible, Inefficient bed responding, kill checks must be improved, and more measures must be put in place to prevent access to gaining blocks. Everybody cares for Java wait till the Bedrock player makes the truly inescapable prison  I play on bedrock we need more love
You are the best
Can we just appreciate how he is still uploading on his birthday 🥳
there has not been one prison that could hold mythrodak
"I used the prison to destroy the prison"
War is the one where he blows shit up. Perfect
Happy birthday boiiii!
next: escaping the intense gravity of Jupiter with a nokia and a rubber band
Happy Birthday mythrodak. I really appreciate all the effort you put in your videos. Would you be interested into trying to escape a prison which i started working on  which utilizes the Create Mod which is mythrodak proof (i hope)
I love the doom music that played in this video "if its a war they want then its a war they they shall have
Happy birthday 🎂🥳🎉
Hello! Next time can you turn down the music a bit? It hurts my head.
ebik
Thank you for this well crafted and very entertaining video!
This gave me literal chills, it was the best video of them all
but could you escape a prison with no spectator/creative investigation before hand
Next round: Mythrodak vs Gaia's Vault
i can't belive these vids have lore
Its my birth day too, bdw love your vids
that was sick
Omg I love this this is my first video of yours but still
Checkmate.
That was so epic
*When DOOM music kicks in.*.
At this point even a bedrock box cant contain him
What song plays during the intro? Wait nvm I’ve heard the sound track many times lol
The doom music is always gonna make it hype and you delivered
EPIIIIIIIIIIIIIICC
10 years later:  “I escape from the worlds most secure prison IRL”
The only thing they fear... is you
Him to eazyyyy
love the doom music
Mythrodak: It’s my birthday today JJkay03: What a perfect time to capture and put him in the deadliest prison            Happy birthday 🎉
Doom music kicks in
How are you so smart
Mythrodak in prison: I'm not trapped in here with you guys. You're trapped in here with me.
.
THIS LOOKS THE TOWNHALL IN HERMITCRAFT
"If it's a war they want. Than it's a war they will get." That was a cool line nice way to escape btw
Last scene was awesome dude....BTW Happy Birthday bro...  Love form India 🇮🇳
Get this guy a new computer for his birthday present
He didn't put capital letters in the chapter names :)
DOOM MUSIC INTESIFIES
Gaia’s Vault
Ok... Now we're just waitin' for him to escape Gaia's vault but actually as viewer I rather watching videos where you escape prison without smuggling in items and without preparation than with preparation (like the Hades vault)
As soon as I heard doom music i knew this would be a good time
i really like your videos and i really respect you for the work and research that you do. i hope i can make you happy with this comment. have a nice day. PS: and also happy birthday
Happy birthday legend
epic
These just get higher and higher production
I love the BFG Division usage in this video, it's awesome! Also happy B-day!
Happy Birthday! Another great vid all around!
Happy birthday! We gonna give you 200k subs for birthday :D
He is epic. Happy birthday
Omg why so complicated? Just do beacon with saturation, and a nether portal trap. Which just mean you're stuck in a fuzzy teleport thing and can't mine, can't move, can't do anything. Basically, let the prisoner move through the portal twice, let them stay in the purple thing, and cover it up. Done, no escape. No death with saturation, no mining, no sleep, no nothing.
Next: escaping a maximum security prison in real life XD
Ur too smart for this bruhh i enjoy ur videos
I looked up underated in the fictionary and dis came up
Fauqin madlad man this dude is unstoppable given enough time to analyze a prison
ares is the god of war but mythrodak is the god of editing (also escaping prisons)
This was like a frickin' movie wth
literally every prison youtuber: *spends actual months on making a perfect prison*  mythrodak: *escapes using a sign and a cake*
Happy birthday great sir!
I would buy you dairy queen but idk how to get it to you
the editing and cinematics in this are insane also happy birthday Mythrodak!!
honey get the popcorn, mythrodak is at it again.
Happy Bday, surprisingly, it’s also my brothers birthday. But that Doom music is hits hard.
HAPPA BIRTHDAY

This New "Minecraft Prison" Genre Is Absolutely Amazing
Holy **** this was amazing
Happy birthday dude! Your videos are so fun to watch :) hope you enjoy whatever you have planned for your birthday

THE ENDING WAS AMAZING! (Happy birthday!)
Very well done

When the Doom music kicks in.
Why does ares vault look likes a white horse or a museum plus ares he is the literal god of war he’s vault should be like hades vault but just like it but better

when doom music kicks in
The editing is on point, can't wait for the next video
4:23 was straight up savage
This prison is insecapable! Timestamp: Blowing up the prison
These videos are getting cinematic and I love it
Happy Birthday Mithrodak
I wish I could like a video 100 times
"Bit Ov'rkill Innit Mate?"
happy birthday
Isnt horus god of war? Maybe a horus prison next, made to contain opped game mode server admins

The commentary with the Doom music was awesome.
HBD
“If it’s a war they want, then it’s a war the’ll get” oooohhhh I got chills
HAPPY BIRTHDAY 🥳 This was a great vid, thank you 😊
5:02 COOLNESS OVERLOAD!
Amazing escape  HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!  P.S. Why do you say " Checkmate " at the end of every single prison escape you do?
im not sure how anyone else feels but i believe that you have entered minecraft legend status!!
BRO THE EDITING WAS ALOT BETTER BROOOO
We should give you a present
Okay but why are the cinematic shots better than movie shots
the doom song really fits also happy birthday
The doom music was beautiful.
Bro, if you can't be bothering to place guardians in creative, then why did you build it at all? And why bother arguing about it? Just because there could be a cookie in my hand doesn't... actually s**t, now I want a cookie, but point stands I don't have one... yet.
13:23 WHAT IS THAT?!
WHEN THE DOOM SOUNDTRACK KICKS IN
Happy birthday mythrodakTV i wish you a happy life
My birthday Is on June 6 :0
Litteral chills man good job
It’s gotten to the point that he's gonna do every single Greek god as a prison.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MAN!
DUDE THATS INSANEEEEEE
Happy birthday 🎊 @Mythrodak
Gaias vault next :)
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MYRHRODAK! :)
Damn the music is a good touch
Happy birthday!
I don’t see the point of not being subbed
It’s a perfect day when mythrodak uploads
HES BACK BABBBBBBBBY
man blew up an entire prision, said "who's next" and then stumbled across ANOTHER PRISION  i dare that whoever builded the other prision must be *"oh shit, im next"*
Happy birthday mythrodak have a great day
Every one go to mumbo jumbo newest video and comment make a prison that no one can escape
Oh happy birthday mythrodak :)
Gaia's vault... With the Nefarious "suicide switch" that perma chunk bans any and all players in the prison, and regular non-permanent chunk bans....  How will you beat that?
damn this stuff got crazy
2:23 Plumpkin says I’m saving them.
Being so confident that he summons the guards to his position, separated from him by two flimsy blocks is the ultimate fuck you.
Holy cow. Your videos just keep getting better and better! Good job, and happy birthday!
You deleted the guards and there computers
Happy bday
That "checkmate" line was just the one of the most badass lines I've ever heard
I always enjoy seeing you escape the prison and the effects are AWESOME
These videos are always so well made
Happy bday
Happy birthday have a good day :)
Not only did he leave, he left with style
Doom music nice. 5:11
who would wait 2 hours to see a 13 minute video
Man the end gave me goosebumps. This is high quality content.
He is stalling
Is this the lock picking lawyer gaming channel?
happy b day also dude the next one is impossible. i sorry but i bein non believer
gaia’s vault hype
Happy birthday
love you metal vibes of this one really went hard on the doom soundtrack this time huh?
Escape seensven's new prison
how did you get the pickaxe
I'm not trying to be mean, but how did you get that pickaxe when you said that the Gear equipping station doesn't give you one?
The way you don't just tell how you escape, but you make it cinematic as well, makes you the best :D
Im working on emderites crystal 😈😈😈😈😈
I thought for some reason mytrodak had 1mil subs did he or not can someone please tell me.
leave the dislikes at 69
He’s just procrastinating Gia’s vault
13:23 So, that a ongoing project or just a build?
Btw i see Guardians eq Has pickaxe (in your inventory)
This is wholesome!
Your videos are always entertaining for me
Happy birthday
God the usage of the doom music is perfect
Every other prison: Slowly walks away
Happy birthday
what's is hardest prison you escaped?
1st. HAPPY B-DAY DUDE!! 2nd, the music drops in all of these videos are awesome. The doom soundtrack while you (REDACTED) was awesome!!
Jay actual scree me
Here before 100000 sub

Push big red button, number go higher, mythrodak big happy!
A Legend
I have wstched you for long time and I Love your vids and happy birthday day mythrodak👑👑👍
ammm, from where did you get the picaxe?
mythrodak is the smartest person i know in history
YOUR SO GOOD AT EDITING HOOOOOOOOOLYYYYYYYYYY SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT
46 minets huh?
*epik*
Next: how to escape your mom from giving you her chancla
I've said this on your other videos, but jeez dude i expected a youtube video not an action movie! Awesome video and happy birthday!
epic :>
WHAT DID YOU DO TO END UP IN THEESE PRISONS  btw happy birthday!
And thats how you be a criminal and have OP loot
doom eternal music at 4:52 lesssss gooooooooo
Happy birthday!
I like it when youtubers hide messages in just a single frame so you have to go slow and pause at the exact frame, its fun.
i don't think this would work with elder gaurdians cuz they would be able to get in before you break a block and they prob got pickaxes already on them cuz who doesn't
How do u keap doing it at almost like u are the builder of the prisons
69 dislikes plz dont dislike it plz
what did I just witness
12:30 when the doom music kicks in
jesus
If you would be in an anime/movie you would be an unbeatable villan 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nic vid the editing was cool AF
YOOOOOO
When the whole prison is made out of obsidian but Mythrodak blows it up anyways
I like how this was made. also happy b-day
Happy birthday Mythrodak and also this is so pog
OMG THAT IS SUCH A CLIFF HAGNER I LOVE IT
Not to ruin the immersion, but you added the pickaxe after lol. Had you forgotten that in a real run of this, that netherite block at the end woulda taken a lot longer to mine and the guards might've been able to break out of their boxes. This escape also goes with the assumption that the warden doesn't have an emergency pickaxe or any guard doesn't have a pickaxe in THEIR ender chest. idk. Great escape really well thought out tho lol
I love how these have story's.
12:43 when the doom music kicks in
Bro your editing and storytelling is off the charts keep it up
Doom music
I never thought a block man could be so badass, and then I watched this video and I stand corrected
absolute chills. Good job man :D    also happy birthday :)
The editing is getting better and better... I fucking love it!!
how'd you get a netherite pickaxe when trapping the guards considering you said that they don't have any pickaxes?
Yall trynna make an innescapable prison like bedrock boxes dont exist
Your videos are epic
i dare you to use the cyberpunk theme for an intro
When you put a lot of effort and he says *since I want a challenge* and proceeds to make it hard by adding rules so it isn’t boring ;-;
Hap birfday man
Happy birthday this is soooo Pog yay I love it
next level trying to escape elkatraz prison BOIII
Next is hades vault im guessing
This man be like, i dont need a partner, prep time, to snuckle in items, imma set my spawnpoint in, and just escape while i destroy the prison
wahy the hell does everyone want you locked up[ so bad dude what the hell you done
happy birthday! :D i'm on time
That ending was like a Saw Movie Twist, and Ivory is Hoffman.
Guards: “Uh, why do I hear boss music?”
doom music makes the ending so great
Bro I just got why your bird is named Shiratori! That’s such a cool reference!
I made you happy
oh shit here we go again
happy birthday!! 🎉🎉
i love how he has to make it harder for himself by setting spawn there, otherwise it would be too easy
Happy birthday Mythrodak! I hope you have a wonderful day 😄
Me i'm next LOL
Once again the editing holy shit
Gaia’s vault ?
Hey myth can you escape my prison? It’s made of bedrock and it’s a box gl

Minecraft's lock picking lawyer
Bro! Intro is fire!!!🔥🔥🔥 Also happy birthday Mythrodak!
Do you play doom.I am asking just because I heard the music
Checkmate -The most iconic line in history
Sheesh
Happy Birthday! I play minecraft PE, I've made an inescapable prison. I wish i could show it.  Its called, 'CatEye Vault' focusing on breaking bedrock in the overworld, the ground being infused with bedrock from the bottom of the overworld. The prisoner has a respawn system (was very hard to make) that if they die in the void, they respawn, being pushed back onto their single block. The closest thing to visiting is sitting 40 or so blocks away,  No items, 3 kill checks before.  I think it's inescapable. The outside is a huge cats eye (orange wool and gold blocks) with 5 blocks of obsidian, then obsidian in between water and lava. Many, many elder guardians to give mining fatigue. Every 8 minutes food is dispensed.   Probably not inescapable.  I have no Microsoft or xbox things for minecraft PE.  Once again, Happy Birthday.
Happy birthday 🥳 also my cousin’s birthday was yesterday
These videos editing is awesome, makes it feel like a real movie.
Guards: Ha he is never gonna escape  5:15 Guards: Why did the boss music start?
the best escape no cap
i swear to god, mythrodak can escape a bedrock box in survival.
For being filled with obsidian it is surprisingly easy to explode
I am waiting for one of the prisons to be called Mythrodak's Vault or Tomb
Halpy birthday Mythrodak
I am now an official Mythrodak Stan.
4:52 i love the The Only Thing They Fear Is U music from Doom Eternal
YOOO THIS IS THE BEST ONE YET ITS SO EPIC YOU TRAPPING THE GUARDS AND EVERYTHING AND BLOWING IT UP
Wow what a great wid why you dont have 2 mil subs yet
Everybody gangsta till MythrodakTV plays DOOM OST
Happy birthday 🎉🎊🎂🎁🎈
the absolute velocity of these videos. I totally expected your next vid to take a month with the quality of these!
if this was a movie i would wach it
I love Mythrodak Lore
HE CRAZY
Nice e
Eventually it gonna run out of Greek gods to name vaults
Happy bday
The doom music made it 5 times better
this guy got popular by escaping minecraft prisons, wow
Big brain
The doom soundtrack. *very good choice*
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
Happy birthday prison slayer!
Wow man, you deserve much more attention, I hope you can get 1 Million subs before the end of the summer!
You just set a new standard for videos I give likes 👍
You know its a good video when you see mythrodak
I think I commented on a video of him escaping a other prison that ares vault is going to come next I was sort of right but it didn’t be the next
The anxious screw cumulatively trip because grandmother intriguinly wrestle next a incredible half-sister. statuesque, abusive pot
Happy birthday
Me taking notes for my prison
Happy Birthdayyyy!!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
I like the DOOM music in the backroud upvote Btw happy birthday
I wish I could add 1millon views to this guy
The doom music made this perfect
He escaped so fast I had a cannon death.
dude ur acctually so smart how did u learn to do this the trend of prisons started not to long ago anyway ur vids r amazing keep up the good work
Mythrodak is done with this. His hatred towards the guards has grown up, as he's tired of being imprisonned. Little did he know that he will soon face the hardest challenge he has encountered so far...
Doom music caught me off guard
Nice escape. But can you escape a real prison ? like Gaia’s Vault or Vault 36 ?
Happy B'day also you are the maddest of mad lads
If u escape seensven new prison we will all sub
My ape brain also releases dopamine when I see numbers get larger. So cool.
This is probably my favorite prison escape so far. Awesome job mythrodack!
Yesssssssssssssssss
I know this is absolutely random and off-topic  But I just have to do this for the better...  super mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

Your editing is so good now
HELL YA THE ONLY THING THEY FEAR IS YOU AND BFG DIVITION! LETS GO
when the doom music kicked in
REALLY ITS MY BIRTHDAY TO 5TH JUNE!!!
Happy b-day
Epic ( also happy birthday )
THIS IS THE 8th prison that this guy escaped   Mythrodak: another prison down more to escape
Your videos keep getting better and better, this was INSANE.
the checkmate thing is the best 1-liner ever
Best video you’ve made by a long shot
Happy Birthday, cool video.
"checkmate" that was awesome
Will there ever be a truly inescapable prison?
wait do you have your new pc? the vid is now on hd
Hey loved the vid! can you try gaias vault now!
Ur insanei love youuu
He didn't only escaped the prison, he also humiliated the creators multiple times...
Happy birthday
Happy b day
JUST PUT THEM IN A BEDROCK BOX. YOU CAN GET BEDROCK IN SURVIVAL WITH A LITTLE REDSTONE
Mythrodak whos next..,.. Me: Gais vault has auto ban syste- Mythrodak: nah
>:)
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!
If the world spawn was in the cell that means the guards spawn in there own prison
happy birthday!!! i am so mad that i had a class during the premier. :(
Happy Birthday your content is great keep up the good work!
gaia's vault when 👀
I love that there is now mythrodak lore
hey! what about the bankers vault
wait so how did he get a pickaxe? didn't he say that the guards dont get them? i totally might've just missed it
Bro this is fire 🔥🔥🔥
OMG GAIA'S VAULT YEEEY
The bit at the end was absolutely awesome i love the check mate and boom
What do you do for a living ??? Oh nothing important I just escape "inescapable"prisons
i love ur vids
And only the hollow shell of a once great structure renained
5:10 can someone tell me the name of the song
Yay
Honestly one of your best videos yet. The Doom music really pushed it over the edge lol.
uhhhhh  do you think ull go to prison mythdorak?    irl
Happy birthday
In the end he be like: I'm coming for u... U can try and run... but ur fate is inevitable
This vid whas soooo epic, i love it
you made this video 1 second too long
When the doom music kicks in
The DOOM music makes it 10x better
hello
Still waiting for Gaia’s vault
1 word : epic
Love the doom music
Happy birthday
DUDE THIS VIDEO GAVE ME CHILLS
Happy bday
Happy bday!
"Checkmate." I loved that
That crawling in the Redstone signal  remind me of the Silverfish Strat. Minus the Chorus Fruit. '3' It's quite entertaining to see you crawl in the very system the Warden made to keep you inside.
Happy bday my guy!
the ending tho
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MYTHRODAK!!!🥳🥳🥳😁😁😁😁
Checkmate : top 10 anime quotes
god this series is just getting better and better I'm glad i found you
Happy birthday man you earned it !
I I
When he started his escape I was like "alright its big brain time".
This was probably the coolest one yet, like you actually just gained access to their entire armory and destroy them all with a trap
SHEESH!!! 12:50
You said that the guards have no pickaxes, where did you get one?
tbh honest this is prob his best video yet, this guy is just amazing holy f*ck.
I legit thought that this would just be another prison escape in that would be kind of boring but that ending and doom music really made this the best of the series so far
happy birthday mythrodak
video idea: make a video on making prisons
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!!! BIRTHDAY POG
you asked so nicely i did it in the past :)
That ending was nice 🍿😁
I bet you are going to put the netherite armor into an ender chest so It could be used in a different prison video which would be smart imo
lmao just put them in an obsidian cave in adventure mode with a pig farm and food dispenser with a conduit
THE DOOM MUSIC I LOVE THIS
Happy birthday
The "checkmate" right before you blow it up is so awesome! I wached it like 20 times.
Next video will just be a bedrock box
Who's next? The most intimidating thing ever said by Mythrodak. Happy birthday!!!! (it didnt let me comment on your pinned one)
Happy bithday
Happy Birthday!
I hope that you won’t get a copyright strike. cuz you know, you’re using other video game soundtracks to spice up your videos.
Happy Birthday!
This would not work with mining fatigues because in one part he breaks a piece of obsidian and it takes 5 mins but with mining fatique it would take 25 hours and the guards would get you in 25 hours.
I have a prison for you An under the map prison Matecheck bro
Man, i love this episode. The tnt explosions were so epic and your "Who's next?" phrase made me think:"Damn, he's just built different..."
THE ENDING OMG your so good at making these vids
the doom music was a good touch
It doesn't have vault in its name POG Edit: oh wait it does I'm just blind and saw ares pris
Happy birthday 🎈 we almost have the same birthday I’m the sixth
hBabatunde Is mCute
5:11 R.I.P headphone users (me)
One of my favourite anime is this
I will commend the next prison that doesn't have the word "vault" in it
This. Is. Epic.
Abrasive vid chill dady
When the DOOM music kicks in
HOW DID YOU GET A PICKAXE
I hear that music from Doom
happy birthday my guy and I hope you have the best day of your life
Dream smp prison started a new Era
Next gaia vault
Wonder what the lore is
Nice plan, the editing is awesome btw.  I know not much people might've caught about this bc of how giga brain the escape plans are. But in Hades Vault, SeenSven was talking to somebody in an orange subtitle.. and Pumpkin has an orange subtitle?
he do be vibing tho
@thubbs 's vault. guardians vault.
Omg this is the best thing ever the sheer quality and amount of effort put into this is mind blowing plus the music this is the absolute best video yet
DOOOOOOOMMMMMM
happy birthday! :D
Doom music
When the doom music kicks in:
wow he destroyed it
the entire "Entry Process" bit (2:17 - 3:30) had some of the best "glitch" effects I've seen in a while
i found one flaw. during the trapping of the guard segment you didn't have a pickaxe from the guard op gear equipper and you didn't have a pickaxe in your enderchest but at  10:33 you have a pickaxe.👀
Next video is gonna be like: Escaping my depression
Oh my god.
Happy birthday! great vid 2
Happy birthday mines in June also
The doom music was a nice touch 👌
"Mytrodak is big happy"  ALT ACCOUNT SUBSCRIBE GO BRRRRRRRRRR
H a p p y b i r t h d a y t o t h e e s c a p e a r t i s t
Next video: escaping with bread and air blocks
Mythrodak: Not only is it huge.  Me: Thats what she said.
Mythrodak has to be my number one favorite youtuber. No one can beat him
I like how he said Ares was the god of war  Because he know that kratos is 😂
this prison has so many flaws
Sorry I’m just confused. You said the guards didn’t have pickaxes but then you got one from the dispensers. And used it to mine netheriet
Happy Birthday, i love the whole prison community, the prisons and exploits get so obscure and useful, just saying, if the guards came after you before putting you in the prison you could just log out. Since the guards can trap this location,  i would suggest carrying around a splash swiftness potion, so when you see the guards you can outrun them long enough to find a  place to lofg out that they cant find/ cant trap.
So i have to escape whit nothing... *doom music intensivise*
I love how he has to blow up everything just because
LOVE THIS!!!
when you hear DOOM music you know its gonna be good 5:15
øk
bruh
Happy birthday!       You are 1 year older. Jun 5
What I'm wondering is how many drugs Mythrodak takes to keep being put in these prisons.
That awesome music and then checkmate WAS SOOOO COOL
He be like "I must break out of this prison"  People:No it's impossible  Him:No it's necessary
HAPPY BDAY MYTHRODAK
Live Stream A Map
THIS IS DUMB WHY CANT I LIKE A VIDEO TWICE!?
Happy birthday Mythrodak!
Achievement Unlocked: Badass Breakout Achievement Unlocked: Ultimate Cell Destruction
And liking the video Is our birthday gift to you. You are amazing. Don't stop being cool.
Shall I make a prison
GG
12:47 gave me chills
Love the minor lore in it! makes it even more fun to watch!
turns around to see Gaia's vault, *the guards stare at mythrodak* they be like RUNNNNNNNNN FOR YOUR LIFE!!!
well done mythrodak, *now the only thing they fear is you*
my man has movies for videos
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! !!
happy birthday my unknown friend
Lol that was so funny when you explained how to escape with mining fatigue. You just have to glitch the entire system, break a block then drown. Simple enough.
WHEN DA DOOM MUSIC KICKS IN :
0:44 WATCH OUT FASH...........
Do Giai’ s vault
Why does this give me black ops vibes when he tries to remember the entry
EXPOZEDE XNEYBRONE IL SHIT PASKIL A ISTI :))))))))))))))))))) !!!!!!!!!!!
When the doom music kicks in:
Dude i love this
Funny enough i was actually listening to doom music while watching this
also nice doom music
I'm an aries
if anyone was wondering what real content was, watch this
4:56 you know it is going to go down when the doom music is played  Me thinking that he will escape by sneakily getting items in. Mythrodak in the end of the video: Full netherite armor, gapples and grieffed the entire prison
Happy B-Day
That was such a perfectly put together film! I’m definitely subbing!
This man  makes good content. I love it.
I love the doom Music
Mythrodak: in an inescapable prison also Mythrodak: this is fine
Editing keeps getting a bit better with every vid
I can only think of 1 way to kep mythrodak in the prison, Change his game mode to adventure mode
how tf is mythrodak so goddamn good at escaping hes literally houdini in minecraft
The Doom 3 OST was a nice touch.
Your vids are getting better every time! I would totally use slime blocks that you can't jump on instead of slime blocks at 9:41 too
LETS GOOO THIS IS INSANE
I love how the screen dims as the drop of the only thing they fear is you gets closer and finnaly hits
Mythrodak constantly escaping prisons is like a movie series that just gets better the more movies are made. Edit: Also nice touch with the DOOM music!
This man deserve’s a sub
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO POG HAPPY BDAY M8
Gigs vault pls
BFG division was the perfect addition to the destruction of the prison.
“If it’s a war they want, then it’s a war they get” *Anime intro plays*
when the doom theme kicks in
I have an prison idea just make bedrock box
YOOOOOO this was so epic
The only thing they fear is you good choice I like Bfg division 4:52.         Bfg division yaaaaaaaaaaaaa 11:54
happy birthday :D
This man needs to take a IQ test
Now do vault 36
i swear after all these prisons mythrodak has escaped he must be a known criminal
What
Yoo, I started remembering the good old days when all YouTubers did was make an lore from an escape type map, love this format. Thanks for bringing back my childhood ❤️
I love your high quality content even if its not very often
heres my b-day present to you i subbed to you
Escaping prisons 101.
no prison can hold this man
If this was a henry stickmin game, this escape would earn you the “like a boss” title
Respect+++
Nobody every asks why Mythrodak is constantly being put into prison in the first place...
Yooooo
Dr Samuel Hayden playing in the background I think
Im legit scared of him now
Next video: Escaping Gojo's infinity from the inside
What is with Gaya's Vault?
they are gonna run out of greek gods to name prisons
Insane editing and clutch escape happy birthday!!!!!
why dont you hawe 1m subs
Ayy yo if ur in jail ever u will escape it with ezz
happybirthday. also sorry I coulnt make the premier but hey it's a good video
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
Holy Jesus Christ the intro is so intense
WHEN THE DOOM MUSIC KICKS IN ITS TIME TO ESCAPE JAIL
You earned my sub you are incredible at these prisons
doom music 5.26
4:33 i like how he just fucked the whole prison in 10 seconds
“Checkmate” that gave me chills dude
Happy Birthday Mythrodak! I really want to make a cake prison for you, but would be so under par. ;-; 🍰🍰      "The guard equip station does not give them a pickaxe" Yet when Mythrodak used it, he recieved a netherite pickaxe? 🗿🗿
Someone needs to make a quote book on mythrodak. 'If it's a war they want then it's a war they get'
I don’t know how it’s possible but every single video gets better and better
the music kill'd my ears in 5 sec
Next: escaping the irs.
"COMMAND BLOCKS ARENT ALLOWED" "YE I SET MY SPAWNPOINT WITH /SPAWNPOINT"
Pog champ
The edit is so powerfull
Ares the God of WAR
DOOM MUSIC YES MYTHRODAK I LOVE YOU!!!
Mythrodak said "Ares *was* the god of war-" this is an allusion to the fact that he is the new god of war.
This would be cool if this was a movie
They should have X-ray instead of breakable glass or a composter glitch with people escaping with it
Happy bday!
Im just scared if he started killing people irl and they try putting him in a prison
Amazing
This is more dramatic then a Quackity lore stream
Mythrodak could probably escape a prison with command blocks in it.
Next: Breaking out of a bedrock cube
When he said checkmate along with the doom music gives me goosebumps already, I also love how he make it cinematic like the real cinema movie,   Good job Mythrodak! :D also happy birthday
This was epic.
him: "nO cOmAnDbLoCkS tHaTs ChEaTiNg nOoOoO" also him: "*/spawnpoint* hahahaha"
Happy birthday to the God of escape   love the little firework show
i am not asking you, but forcing you Mythrodak to TAKE OVER THE ALGORITHM
mythrodakTv IS AWESOME!
This one is epicc
Me just builds a bedrock box
Next vid escaping inescapable prison with newfound walmart version of ranboos enderman abilities
Inescapable prison: command block that kills you over and over that infinitely repeats. It’s also illegal.
Me hearing the doom music
i think this is my favorite episode yet, the editing and music amplify everything tenfold, good stuff :]
This vid rocking Doom music
THIS. DUDE. IS. INSANE
This guy makes his videos so entertaining to watch, keep up the good work!
2:23 A jack'o'lantern? "I'm saving them"? Do I detect... LORE?
"whos next?" UMM me?
Make some vids like this but with the guards
Happy birthday!
This dude can be arrested into a maximum security prison and would still escape.
I have a question, where did u get the picaxe? U said that the armor equip station only gave armor weapons and gaps
now you have to blow up every prison you escape.
I have been waiting for you to escape gaia’s vault thank you this is going to be great
2:18 MYTHRODAK SWEAR?? OMG CANCELLDSED
Damn! Why do every prison gotta be someones vault. ;)
It looks more like a museum outside
The “Ares is the god of war” line was great
Happy birthday
When the doom soundtrack kicks in
bruh just stop with these prison vids dream has already escaped ;-;
U clever genius I want to be a clever person like you
Mythrodac :Get's put in a real prison Also Mythrodac : out in 0.999 seconds
Prison makers: Yep this vault is IMPOSSIBLE to escape noone will break out Mythrodak: Ima pretend i didnt hear that
Happy birthday mythrodak! Have a wonderful day
WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO CONTAIN THIS MAN
Checkmate...
Happy birthday love your videos your Voice its so relaxing
No one : Literally no one : Me : Happy Birthday ❤️
The amount of chills I got from watching may be unhealthy
You are Einstain+cool.Thats the best combinasion.I love your content and also do you have merch?
11:47 THANK TO OUR SPONSOR RAID SHADOW LEGENDS
When doom music kicks in and that means its time to get sirious (sorry for bad grammar)
How Mythrodak isn't a Netflix series yet siezes me
U da best ma dude =F
The prison phase of Minecraft has already passed but this dude yoinked a bunch of long term viewers, gg’s. Edit: it probably has something to do with him making it lore and stories and stuff, and not just escaping, because let’s be honest, just escaping isn’t something you want to keep watching
I love how he easily gets out at first but has to put an extra challenge to make it interesting
Happy birthday :D your my favorite youtuber easily.
Happy birthday
happy birthday!
let us just appreciate that sweet doom music
wait what the shield is enchanted...?
I found a guy in a mythrodak skin and we played Hypixel for about an hour and talked about how good your videos are. It was very wholesome
When the doom music kicks in:
This editing is so cool for a Minecraft video what
this isn‘t even Minecraft anymore, it‘s now an anime lol
Happy birthday
Good luck with gaias vault!
the doom music lol
My sleep paralysis demon 0:36

At some point these people are gonna run out of ancient gods
Prison for guards...
Didnt you say they dont get pickaxes how did you get it
fun fact:        you rewatched the part when he said "this place has dozens of death traps" then he got captured
pp pu pu check  btw happy birthday :D :) <3
«Who’s next» It’s you’re ultimate challenge, Gaias vault.
I was vibeing when the *DOOM* music kicked in
4:54 when the doom music kicks in
Love the choice of music!
Someone h makes a prison thats unscapable  Mythrodak:are u sure about that

Happy Birthday 🎈🎉
Never stop upload videos plss

Someone gift this man a prison with an original name
You didn't just escape the prison, you destroyed the prison. damn good job
When the doom music kicks in 4:57
EPIC VIDEO!!!!!!!! MUST WATCH!!!  (I like the music also)
WOW
So it would've been totally safe, if they would've placed that one Redstone one block higher?
These keep getting cooler with each video
POGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love your lore Mythordak. Iy is a master piece.
Escape Guardian's vault plz . Also Happy birthday 🥳 : D
Happy Birthday Mythrodak! Also Theres A Prison Name Prison Mythrodak Just For You
Bff division is my favorite doom song, good choice
Next up: escaping reality and becoming god
Bruh that was so dramatic lol
5:05 why do I hear doom music?
who's next..   Those are scary words from mythrodak
JUST MAKE A FUCKING UNDERGROUND PRISON COVERED ENTIRELY OF CRYING OBSIDIAN 5000X5000
1 hour and it already has 50K Views
Him: who’s next  Me: just run for the love of god
the best prison: a 1x2 bedrock room
I fucking love how he just goes full "with this shit again", gives us a working solution in less than 10 seconds, then puts his own restriction on escaping. Like holy fuck, birthday boy is savage as shit.
bro this wasn’t a guide it was a cinematic experience
When he said "Checkmate" I felt like he was Techno XD
Im tired i  wwant to splleep
OMG Get Rekt
Can you try to escape rays works' prison? i rly want to know if there is even a possible way (and im trapped in a copy of it on a public smp)
i am still in the premier with 40 other people, what madlads
great vid as always!
But can she escape the Banker's vault
that doom music hit  different
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
Now the question that nobody asks:                 why is he being sent to prison?
Soon
Mythrodak makes this look so easy, happy birthday
its sad to know that a bedrock box would be the best way possible
Yes I love it
man waiting for gaia’s vault ( hyped)
Doom music intensifies
You know its serious when the Doom music kicks in
this guy is a god
Happy birthday
Happy Birthday Mythrodak!
Hey dude, this was awesome.
And there is a prison named gaurdians vault (I think) so check out that
Dear God, it's like watching an oceans 9 movie

Happy birthday! Guys let’s surprise him with 190k!!
yo cool
Happy birthday
Gaias Vault is next Holy crap....
Bruh you can not be captured ever no matter what prision
New PC less gooo
There actually were no guards because his game paused when he put the sign at 8:17
They're going to re-open Alcatraz to put this man in it... and he's still going to escape it.
4:51  When the DOOM music kicks in
The fbi: tries to imprision MythrodakTV. The fbi 15 minutes later: WHAT? H O W?
Me trying to do the same thing...  Downloads the world way too many block PC die instantly  Prison makers win... They say EZ
5:06 DAMN THATS PART GOES HARD EITH THE DOOM MUSIC DOOM IS LIKE MY TOP GAMES TOO
"roses are red" "youtube is to" "i got my first like" "why is it blue?"
Why are so many prisons named after Greek Gods and Goddesses
Happy birthday
thank you for the doom music
Mythrodak what a way to end the prison escape happy birthday
BRO WHAT IS THAT PRISON IN THE END
happy bithday Mythrodak!
good job
Its only a matter of time
you escaped ares vault on singeplayer, whenever u placed a sign the game would freeze, it doesn't do that in multiplayer.
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday Mythrodak, happy birthday to you!!!! :D
Happy birthday mythrodak!
The doom music works so well here is amazing
This should get alot more attention the music and the editing is perfect. An especially that part when u said checkmate. So underated keep up the good work.
Doom music
The escape is smart, the storyline is amazing, the music is fire, what else can I say?
Honestly, with the way this story seems to be going, it feels like Mythrodak is going to be the villain.
Mennn, the music when blowing up was Awesome
This man is terrifying… *I like it.*
I clicked faster than...uhmmm... You
Constuctive criticism: If you said "war they shall get" it sounds more cooler
This editing is amazing!
lets not look at the fact that he calls the prisons escapable while hes the only one who has the skill to do it
5:10 WHEN THAT DOOM MUSIC KICKS IN
Mythrodak are you scared of Gaia’s vault?
Guard: Let me out! Mythrodak: Did someone say BOOOM?!!
His vids are getting better and better love ur content
Mythrodak said “I am very hard to see, cuz my skin is mostly black” , so what if he’s going to change his skin to match a prisoner’s one for the next video? Just an idea I had :D
next: escaping the never ending pull of a black hole
escape bankers vault!
the doom music fits perfectly with this
you earn my respect
escape vault 36 next plz
I love how he overreacted and it just made 1000 times better
This is a comment
Happy Birthday!
Happy Birthday
0:45 Ears go bye bye
Nice doom music
Happy birthday
We still don't know what you're in prison for
Me at the start of this vid: ok if he actually does this ima sub. Me at the end: *subs with respect*
13:18........................ I am so encouraged to say i am
Ok, let me preface this comment by saying that most minecraft videos that arent guides to builds usually bore me and are only used as background audio. This video however had me hype to see how you escaped and that bit with the intro and the doom music was literal gold.
Hows the song called at 5:17
Dramatic as hell.  Butilikedit
Wow, you have a great production value.GREAT JOB :)
Happy birthday mythrodak 🎉🎂🍰🥳🎈
happy birthday
Mythrodak can never join the Dream SMP because he'll break Dream out of prison before Wilbur or Techno ever could
That was... Brutal...
(12:47)........!CHECKMATE!
The doom music just 👌 the icing on the cake
Happy birthday
hey question try escaping a bedrock prison hahahaha
You are my favourite prison youtuber like holy you are the best!
most badass escape!
your so underrated because you only have 1.8k subs and you have escaped every prison so far
happy birthday and best edits ive seen!!
Keep up the great Content!
Wait a minute, you said that the guards don’t get picks from their equipment station. But then you got a pick from the equipment station. Hmmmm?
Guards: We trapped you! Mythrodak: *uno reverse card*
mi boy did it again
OOHHH DAT DOOM OST
Happy Birthday Mythrodak! It may please you to know Technoblade's was just three days ago...  This video was absolutely awesome... but then, that's nothing new on your channel :)
When the doom music plays
wow
happy birthday !!!
Have you ever played the escapists?
Aye buster, I am making something you will not be able to escape from.
The build looks like a Athena's temple
“Obisidan doesnt take that much to break with your fist just 5 minutes” so speedy breaking even faster than an efficiency 100 gold pick
Bro happy birthday
best prison: 100 layers of bedrock
Happy birthday mythrodak! This is probably the most furious prison break for you!
love the casual doom music
Next one: escaping prison irl
Clever :)
Gayas vault any one
10:24 how he get a pick he said the guards didn’t have picks
Dang mythrodack always winds some insane ways to escape and I can’t wait for the next one
Didn’t he say the Gaurds don’t get pickaxes so how did he get one From the wardens thing
Too much tnt
2:36
That "checkmate" combined with doom music was clean af
Nobody Mythrodaktv at the end be like:every one will die
DANG this is a good video
Man they must of done something reeeaaaalllllll bad to get locked up in all these prisons
you really take it seriosly and give it a bit story to it. keep it up😙
mythrodakTV I love you you in my top ten YouTubers! the editing is insane and it’s just the right amount of comedy. I love how you gave is story through remembering at stuff. I, subbed BTW
1 million subs. Esceping a real prison
This Anders me because he acts like the not having mining fatigue is for speed but if he had it the speed he would break everything would give the guards immense amounts of time to stop him
Next: Escaping a bedrock box with NOTHING
That checkmate was absurd
This man could escape a prison in real life if he wanted to.
Damn this intro was crazy
ending is epic af
life lesson: just dont use the freeking redstone bed trap
Happy birthday
4:20 Rip immersion
Gaia’s vault next plz
DUDE HE PUTS SO  MUCH EFFORT INTO THESE CINEMATICS AND THEYRE SO COOL
4:52 holy ************
damnn this one was epic :D
OH MY GOD ITS TIME FOR THE PRISON TO END ALL PRISONS Gaia's Vault
Like well deserved! Good work Mythrodak!
Can we all agree the doom music makes it way cooler
another great video! cant wait for the next! also happy birthday!
Happy birthday
Mmm doom music good :)
OMG THIS WAS SO INTERTAINING
Nice
the checkmate was perfect
Mythrodak: I'm going to use tnt to blow up your prison so it doesn't hurt anyone. The prison: Made entirely of blast-proof materials and water.
Happy birthday Mythrodak!!
I'm amazed how this man is able to escape from *literally anything*
You could actually direct a movie, this story and camera angles are insane
Your new name is the chosen one
YES LETS GO GAIAS VAULT IS NEXT Edit: happy birthday Mythrodak
Within na hour
Dream stuck in pandora's vault while this man has escaped like 10 prisons!
13:23 that prison tho
your small bits of non-dramatic comedic speech are really the best part of these videos.
When did tou got the netherite pick, the refill of the guards didn't have one and your enderchest also didn't got one
Man this gives me cool movies vibe
next video: breaking bedrock without items
Everyone talking about what prison he should escape next, but can we all appreciate how good the edit is and the amount of effort he puts in these videos?
Shiratori once again
This was insane, amazing.
This is really well edited
Why don’t people make more original prisons Every prison is just obsidian, water, lava, and redstone machines
Bro 16 minutes ago? I’ve never been this early
i subed so big happy
HB
OK we get this is to easy! Now make the prison harder + no redstone only repetors and make the guard have hacked clients
When you hear the doom music.. *the only thing they can’t hold is him*
This guy needs to be in the Dream SMP.
Happie birthday mythrodak 😊
The doom music tho
Happy bday
HAPPY BIRTHDAY !!!!!!!
AMAZING!!!
when the do music kicks in
This man can break out of Alcatraz if he wants to
Happy birthday!!!
Get a sub :)
Yes. Gia's vault is going down
cool vid man
I’ll do one better, Happy MF’n Birthday Mythrodak, now go eat cake and drink Teremana with a splash of ZOA.  (seriously, have a great birthday weekend)
doom music
the bfg division tho in the end was so perfect
Uh Oh they're running out of greek gods and goddesses
4:55 RIP AND TEAR
The "checkmate" at the end gave me chills
Nice
So much good content  mythrodak Luke the notable i mean even raya and the last dragon came out yesterday on Disney plus
1:05 the way jjkay03 said that reminds me of The Warden of The Wall from Henry Stickmin
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!! (I read the pinned message) 🍰🎉🎂  Also great video! Love the background music
Wouldn't it be even harder to escape if the guards were given pickaxes?
nice
Beautiful editing. Thank you, I really enjoyed it! Keep it up!
Amazing video I love the editing as usual, good job! * slow clap * I will fix the prison.  Some Notes: - Why don't we have picks? I mean the guards don't only have the stuff that is inside of the prison. This is usually for back up, when they are teleported inside they already have their normal survival stuff so a PICK! (or Ender chest)  - And yes, of course you can escape this prison without mining fatigue it was designed to work with MINING FATIGUE if you remove it the prison wont work as intended (example: Why would I put signs in the respawn trap if there is no mining fatigue...).  - When you teleport all the guards to their stasis chambers, it won't work as you intended. They will not all get teleported.. the warden never has a pearl in his chamber when he is in the prison, 2nd you activate the guard stasis chambers not the WARDEN ONE so the warden will not be tarped during your escape. And you didn't consider that one of the guards could also be offline when you try to teleport them, in this case he will just have to login.. and your dead.   - “The guards can’t get in when it’s day”, if you don’t have mining fatigue they don't have it as well, break one glass, pearl on the platform, pearl in the respawn chamber. Dead.  - Mining the obsidian at the bottom of the pit.. mhm good luck doing that without the guards noticing that you're gone, "The pit is shadowy so they won't be able to see me" F3+B...  - RIP Mining fatigue III, we just mine obsidian here :(
ayyy pog
5:10 you gotta love doom
I love how he plays doom music
I’m sorry to ask but can we have the numbers for everything you did like you used to
Epic.
Pong of music
Pls try guardians vault by thubb
That was sick!
Mythrodak: who’s next? *sees Gaia’s vault* mythrodak: GET OVER HERE
Netflix ❎ MythrodakTv ✅
HOW THE HELL ARE THESE MINECRAFT VIDEOS SO GOD DAMN WELL EDITED, WTF??!! some films need to learn from this dude sheeesh
Mythrodak, what mac do u play on? The framerate is suprising.
5:10 my brain: damn, I wonder  how hes so good at editing XD
POG
Ok cool but I HEAR DOOM MUSIC
MythrodakTV 1 year later be like: I escaped prison IRL
Escaping the deadliest prison in the most deadliest way.
5:10 when the doom music drops
ayo
cyberpunk
I like the doom eternap msuic
Little do we know he could be an escaped prisoner in real life
help mommy im scared
he has a pickaxe in his inventory so i think its not a legit escape
Dude, the DOOM music was a perfect addition! Also, Happy Birthday to you!
the videos are getting better and better, you deserve way more subs for the work you do
He’s gonna start going on a killing spree of all the prisons, prison guards, and wardens
Best one yet
gaia's vault
Who’s next
bank
insane editing my guy
4:51 you know what happens when the doom music kicks in
may i make a prison for you
this is sooo epic
bruh!!
doom music :)
THAT WAS AMAZING, I'm sad I was busy during the premiere, but it was great! Also Happy Birthday!
Yes
Happy birthday
This guy is the Kratos of escaping prisons LITTERALLY
Gaias volt is next
I subscribed and happy birthday!
Perfect timing for my birthday!
Dann so smoooth
5:11 why do you always try and deafen me???
A small mistake...You could have shown that you got the Netherite Pickaxe from the Ender Chest 10:17  but it just magically appeared at 10:25 .... so not much difference in escaping.. but be careful later while Editing..   Other than that Awesome Video..
Simple prison idea to keep Mythrodak inside, bedrock sometimes generates with a standable place between it but you need a trapdoor to get inside and once you are in, there is no going out but I haven't thought of a respawn system but as the person would have to die of starvation that is punishment enough.
"C H E C K M A T E"
Why greek gods?!?!?!
I’m watching this while waiting for a plane i’m going on since i’m on vacation to do things and i’ve been here for an hour and 30 minutes…wish me luck people
All they fear is you.
Probably the most exciting escape you’ve done so far. Also love the ending, what a way to hint your next prison
happy birthday!!
nobody: mythrodak in year 6969: escaping the event horizon of a black hole.
what was that vault at the end?
13:15 Holy __shit__ this man is not fucking around.
is there a prison that this man cant escape?
SOMEONE PLEASE MAKE KRATOS’S VAULT

He escaped two ways
Bro within like 2 weeks of your 100k special you are at 185k
Oh lord here he comes
the doom music slaps
I love this!
whaaaaaaat? almost 200k  subs?
I  feel like they arent making prisons to one up other prisons, or to make it more protected from dream, And are now just making them FOR mythrodak to be in, not for dream.
Ahhh yes, Christian music
when gaia
POG GAIAS VAULT NEXT
"Checkmate.." I have never been so scared of the word checkmate until today
I love how he calls his bird shiratori, refering to an irl prison escape expert
Hi prison houdini
He’s beaten gods now he’s going for the mother of the gods
Poggers
864th
You seed that the guards wont g’et any pikaxes

These videos are so well made they're more like movies. Also loved the doom music
Nah bruh this dude is epic Sorry not epic “Legendary”
AMAZING BIG POG ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE AND MIND BOGGLING
not only that he escaped the prison but he cyber bullied guards aswell
When the doom music kicks in
Prison building rule #1: Must be named as "(insert Greek god)'s Vault"
oh god gaias vault is next. and seeing how he incapitaed the gaurd force here i think hell do it again do avoid the self destruct feauteure of gaias prison
Earth’s deadliest wish: Being pinned by Mythrodak  When you see a shooting star, you will have a tiny chance to survive if you wish to be pinned by a YouTuber  Me: Really... WELL TOO BAD
Gaia's vault let's goooooooo
Imagine if someone called the police on u irl and you get locked in what will you do 😏
when the doom music kicks in
you know shits about to be real when u hear the doom opening
4.30 lmao he just escaped the whole prison in 10 sec lmaooo
Bro u think you cool i escaped the overworld using just a wooden pick, wood, stone pick, sticks, iron pick, diamond  pick, obsidian, flint, and iron.
Hidden lore 👀
gotta say, mythrodak's video making skills are some of the best out there imho
love ur vidz man
This was so cool
Holy Moly, each video the editing and production get better and better, keep up the good work man!
The only thing they fear... Is Mythrodak.
I love how he says CHECKMATE in a serious voice at the end of his videos.
Mythrodak be like: "Ares... god of war.... cute nickname. I think I'll keep it." *lights the fuse and walks away from the explosion!*
WHEN THE MYTHRODAK IS SUS
“Making an anime ending in minecraft”
Got a new pc?
i dunno man maybe stop breaking the law?
I like the doom music
How did he have a pick when he said they don’t get one
The way he said “checkmate” gave me chills
Wow good job!!
I love this content so muck keep it up
Ah yes the doom soundtrack
How to escape a prison        */gamemode c*
Escape Vault 36 then u coward(:
His videos get better and better
Checkmate..
Try gaia's vault
FINALLY...60fps!!
Checkmate
When the doom music kicks in 🎶
Petition for Mythrodak to turn this into a cinematic series
When will youtube give this guy a red series where he escapes real prisons
The reason about mining fatigue is so good,and i like ur channel very much so im gonnna rewach video like 20 times.(all who see this comment do the same for algorithm,lol)
😍Myth😍Ro😍Dak😍
4:31 you just destroyed the hopes and dreams of the guy
"Checkmate."  BRUH ITS ONE WORD HOW DID U MAKE IT SO GOOD
8:00 when the doom misic kicks in
the only thing they fear is you
Your probably on the FBI's watch list lol
13:15 - GAIA'S VAULT POG
that was epiiiic! next: Escaping God's prison
DAMN! I love your videos, your voice-overs, your editing style, and your storytelling especially! Great job again, you keep improving with every video and I hope that your channel keeps growing quick because you hella deserve it!
Once "the only thing they fear is you" started playing i instantly liked
No kidding this is literally the greatest video I have ever watched. The music, the explosions, the editing, EVERYTHING
Next: Becoming William Afton to escape hell” me: Scott ain’t gonna be happy with this 😨
Me waiting for a vault to be based on Egyptian mythology:   People only making Greek mythology: Nah, I don't really feel like it.
Bro this man is smarter than all my dog combined
Just started watching and already less than 5 minutes in this man just shit on the prison🤣
Dooom musik
Next: Becoming William Afton to escape hell” me: Scott ain’t gonna be happy with this 😨
God's vault: ALL BEDROCK
This wont ever stop
What if the guards broke the glass and pearled in the cell (there is no mining fatigue) then towered up to u while u were breaking the redstone ore
STOP IT WITH THE GREEK GOD NAMES!!! Edit: By the way it's the most deadliest prison because Ares is the god of war.
I like his songs like it really hypes his vids
No elder guardians
Mythrodak when the doom soundtrack kicks in ok let’s do this
Everyone gangsta until mythrodak escaped an irl prison
should of blocked up the path behind you, to delay the guards : )
When the doom music kicks in
This is so cool!
Epic when doom music kicks in
no prison has used end portal frames or bedrock in their builds yet...
5:11 When the doom music kicks in
Dream better add you to the smp
Me making noises with my mouth the whole time
Goddamn that was cool
How many vaults - prisons are there?
“I’m saving them” said the jack’o lantern
When he said “checkmate” i got chills
Hello 5:00 doom music starts playing
Everyone gangsta untill Mythrodak Escapes Gaia's Vault in adventure mode
Did you said check mate or czechmate?
Next video- escaping Minecraft
25mins ago
He has returned bigger stronger and better
Ok
Mythrodak always comes up with the most badass quotes like: "Ares was the god of war, and if it is a war they want, then it's a war they'll get."
Is someone gonna make a Zues’ vault?
Next video: I escaped Satan's grasp.
You're awesome and the editing is godlike
Next escaping ADX  Florence in real life
tnt go boom
That do music tho
This a Netflix series, the edition is SOOO good, congratulations :D
next: Zeus’s vault
The editing
The storytelling is as epic as ever and the music and editing elevated the whole thing. Can't wait for your next work
I flinch to my phone as soon he played doom music  Edit: the only thing they fear is you the song I love this and BFG division
Another reason why elder guardian command blocks aren’t a load because there is bug mythrodak can use with them not giving him mining fatigue for a while when there is to many
Hi
This is like a whole new movie   Where are my mythrodak universe charts
Nice job, how'd u get the pickaxe tho, it wasn't in your enderchest and not in the loot dispensers from the guards..
Mythrodak will remain a myth for escaping prisons.
Wow, that is beyond impressive.
Escaping the expanded infinite universe with a pen
This was so epic
Everyone gagsta til’ mythrodak explodes the prison
The myth the legend the Mythrodak
These videos are getting better and better
Pog

The final was gglorius
hows the new pc?
Gaias vault when?
12:47 Checkmate
YES!!!!!!! I have honestly been dying to watch another one of your prison escape video! Thanks you for making these amazing videos!
That was epic, I'm so glad I waited for the premiere.
excuse me but where tf did you get that netherite pickaxe from? it wasnt from the warden's setup
Moosh man
Let's GOOOO
you have incredible edits. tell your editor (especially if its you) that i said they did a sensational job and everything looked cleaner than the plates i eat off of.
That was the right soundtrack for the video
Christoper Nolan but in Minecraft
Next: breaking out of the 4th dimension
THE CHILLS
Next video  I blew up Gias vault using a stick and some gunpowder
His mask makes it look like he is tired
13.32 , epic foreshadowing
I think it's not like mythrodak has to escape the prison, the prison has to escape mythrodak
DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMM
He put doom music!
He should join dream SMP, get caught and sent to prison and then escape getting dream out as well!!!!!!
There goes his career...
Where is the pickaxe from?
Checkmate    :D
Him: ima blow this all up.                                                                                          That guy: oh shoo-
Gaia's vault next yesses
If guards had pickaxe his escape could be ruined
all of that just because they decided to use redstone ore lol
Can you escape Gaia vault
try to defeat hamsters vault
Hey Mythrodak, you should try and do something like this but with actual guards. Like, give some people a week to set up a prison, you a week to investigate it, and then they try their best to stop you from escaping while you do your best to escape. Just make it more of a series/game type thing. Not saying that this should replace these amazing videos, but just think it would be cool to see how well these concepts would work with real guards.
We all know 11:48 was just to flex your new PC
The vid was amazing and jeez i wouldn't even know how to escape that valut 0-0
mythrodak: blowing the whole inner prison obisidian: what? i dont feel anything?
Gaia's vault is next.
Yooo the lore, the editing, the freaking intense dramatic feeling of your videos!!??!  IT'S MORE THAN AMAZING!!
Made server with fans like guards for gaia's vault
Your videos are actually better quality than most movies i've watched
"who's next?" GAIA'S VAULT LET'S GOOOOO
He has more tnt in a prison than 5 year olds is in creative sheeessh
Escape the guardian vault V.2 (is that what its called? Idk)
MythrodakYT: **escaping prison** **igniting TNT** **Only Thing They Fear Is You starts playing in the background**
His parrot's name is Shirotori, which is bird in Japanese.
You do know there's a map download, so it can still hurt others
He’s the man the myth the mythrodak
THE FACT THAT HE USED DOOM MUSIC MADE HIM EARN MY HIGHEST RESPECT FOR IT
