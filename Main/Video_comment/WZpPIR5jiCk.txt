Hey eagles! <3 Staffan here :) I want to send my biggest love to Ammar, Thomas and Tommy for making me face my single biggest fear & holding the space along the journey. Love you guys! This moment transformed my life, and I will forever carry it as a compass and guiding light. That when fear hits hard, we can breathe and let it flow through our body and let miracles be born. I feel reborn after this jump!  I also want to say endless thanks for all your support since joining the team officially. You guys make me cry my eyes out of gratitude!! The world is feeling lonely, and for me the Yes Fam is an island of hope. Let’s keep changing the world together. Love you all! <3  Staffan

Fuck it. I’m scared of heights but I just set an appointment to skydive where I live😩🤝🏾 wish me luck it’s in two weeks 🫡
I did my first skydive today, nothing like this, just a standard tandem, I can relate to everything these guys are saying, your fear is just limiting you from living.
That has been a dream of mine but could never do it alone,that’s so cool,if you come to New Zealand n need someone to jump out a plane ,I’m 58,sky dived before ,bungyed ,I hate heights but love the adrenaline ,so proud of you Stefan,you will never forget that 🫶🏻🙌🏻🤟🏻
Amazing!! Another dream of mine besides a HALO jump!🪂👍🏾
I just found this channel about a week ago, and I've been binging your content. I've already commented on a video or two, and I know this comment is already late too so not many will see it. I FELT this entire video. There are two things in this world that truly terrify me, spiders and heights. I've lived as the only adult in my house for about five years, so I've been forced to face my fear of spiders. Which I've come a long way. But heights? I have rappelled down a building once, but that's concentrating on what you're doing and looking up (looking down and seeing the possible fall is the scary part). It's a big step, yes. Skydiving, though, is a lot of looking down while the fall is happening. I felt every moment of Staffan's fear, excitement, dread, wonder, everything. Even the possibly unexplainable feelings once he landed. This is your video I have connected with most from beginning to end. I probably have connected more with some moments in others, but this is the most with an entire video.
that was insanely brave
Oh wow
Found this gem for the first time this week, and as always y'all touched my heart! Serendipity came along the next day when teaching my kindergarten class of 25 kiddos and during a story about an unknowing caterpillar wishing he could fly, I overheard a few of my students discussing how they too wished they could fly. Several others echoed in agreement and I immediately remembered Staffan's comment about kids wishing they could fly. It turned into a wonderful learning moment where I talked with the kids about the importance of following their dreams and in the power of embracing challenges and the overarching message of "Love Over Fear". Thanks, guys!
I’m going on my first tandem skydive today with my brother who also has never been skydiving. Thank you so much @yestheory for inspiring me to conquer my fears💗
Didn’t they say 25k feet ? And they didn’t need oxygen ??
Ive been on a binge of your videos lately but so far this has been one of the most emotional/inspiring one. It makes you realize how much fear takes from you. 💪🏼
That was insane! First skydive and you went for the most dangerous one? My heart was racing just watching this. Major respect for taking the leap!
12:00 "Fear doesn't prevent death; fear prevents life."   Wow, Staffan 🙏🏼
Staffan is a beautiful soul and brings so much to the videos 🥹
I think I know how I will celebrate my 50th birthday! Staffan you inspire me...all of you guys do.
simply WOOOOOOOOWWWWWWW - proud of you - Love from Canada
Ammar: This is going to be the greatest experience of your life! Staffan: *retches*  lmaooooo
I badly want to this, Yes theory can you make my dream come true😂
9:29 ❤❤❤❤❤PR
something about us sweds and hieghts lol. This would be my greatest fear as well.
these videos are changing my life
Fuck yeah Staffan!! Absolutely incredible to go from retching to flying in a matter of minutes. That's the most impressive conquering of fear. 100% authenticity.
Bless his little heart. 😭💙
Stephan is weird brev
These type of videos where you face your fears, never fail to bring tears to my eyes. 🤟
So proud of you Stephan! You are rubbing feathers with the eagles now!
These people try to make everything way more dramatic than it is. It was just a tandem jump. Not that big of a deal.
Thank You for making amazing videos
Right on, that was amazing. Love it, glad you said 'yes'
I actually love to get out of my comfort zone  And one of my dream to skydive 😩
Steffan is the greatest.
I like stephan now haha brave as fffok
I wish i could be there to encourage you. I quit riding because i was taking too many chances. I worked at a bike shop for about 22 years. We sold and repaired japanese bikes and quads. I come home one day and my wife said its her or the motorcycles. I quit racing. You are an inspiration like she was. Keep trying, never quit.
Beautiful ! ♥
i am from nepal and my seeking discomfort by doing world tour :( but without a lot of money its  seems very hard
Staffan is very very cute :(
Face Everything And Rise. i really like this
A HEAD FULL OF WORRIES AND FEARS HAS NO ROOM FOR DREAMS AND ENJOYMENT ❤
You guys inspired me so much  Thank you
God this was truely amazing to see Staffan overcome. Weirdly enough, I dont have any physical fears apart from a severe fear of vomit which stops me doing so many things. Seeing staffan get ill when Ammar told him was really hard to watch because i cant ecen imagine how nervous you have to be to get like that. But he overcame it and wow what an incredible fear. Totally seeking discomfort. So proud!!
So very cool!
Would love to skydive while doing a meditation in the air
that was beautiful
Your unnecessary story telling before the video makes it so boring. I skip to the end of your every video
This is so beautiful🥲
I’ve never felt so much joy though a sliver of a screen ever ❤
STEFAN you are a hero of your own fear man!!! Wow!!!!🤩
I bawled! ❤ Congratulations Staffan!
Hey Ammar. I’m Thomas Babson and I’m very enthusiastic about all things skydiving. I’m 18 and live in Temecula, CA. I’ve seen your videos on YouTube. I really want to learn how to skydive with your crew. So, if it’s ok with you, I’d like to join as a new member of Yes Theory so I can live the experience of a lifetime! I’ve started the ‘Seek Discomfort’ package with the code seekdiscomfort60.
That is also my last fear left. Got confronted with fear of closed space in cave that you can crawl trough like a baby being born and was little oxygen anyhow... I climbed trees and would tie myself to it until I could look down more calmly. Now sometimes I look up skydivers but still have no way to do last thing on my list. And I am now 42. Life is funny. Greetings from Croatia and thank you for inspiring expressions of life!
Merci tellement ❤❤❤
I truly feel his emotions as i'm super afraid of flying via airplane and i'm in a situation where i must hop on 2x airplanes tomorrow to visit family and i feel a hole in my heart just thinking about it
Yes theory has officially become Point Break IRL
That was a very honest and amazing account! It's like that, and changes you a lot! Everyone should tackle their fears, it makes you a better person ;) Thanks all of Yes Theory for being you!
I’ve only gone skydiving once. Hands done one of the freeing feelings in the world. I can’t recommend it enough.  I was more scared of the ride up to altitude than I was actually jumping lol
This video makes me cried. I am also scared of heights and when staffan did this it felt like it was me did that challenge. This is the reason why I loved watching ya’lls videos. It’s so inspirational. Keep up the good work guys.
💜
I started crying when they jump, and the upbeat music is on. You can tell how happy Staffan was, he's like a newborn. Thank you Yes Theory. Your productions are gold. 11/24/2023
editing is top notch
I would do it for my country, but doing it for fun seems nerve racking lmao
Someone with connections please get this to Nicholas Cage lol poor guy
Steffan having an anxiety attack when you surprise him is ligit me !
Steffan was such a good addition to the team!! He’s so calming and easy to be around
@13:09 Tandem wingsuit starts. @19:18 brake forward speed, wave off, deploy drogue, open tandem canopy as usual. Props to the cameramen  Worlds most dangerous? Oh please. You jumped a tandem wingsuit with an extremely experienced wingsuit and tandem pilot, you guys had a tandem gear, you guys had a massive main canopy (~350sqft), you guys had a reserve which was repacked yearly, you guys had an AAD, you guys had an RSL (probably a MARD too), you guys had a lots of reserve altitude for in an event of a malfunction. All those safety features. Don't tell me it was world's most dangerous. Not first, not world's, and most importantly not dangerous at all. Clickbait title ffs. Dislike
One of the best yes theory videos, I remember when Ammar skydived, it gave me goosebumps, cuz it’s the best feeling in world. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Most healthy internet community. I love to read comments.
I AM SO PROUF OF YOU STAFFAN. I really hope I'd get to do whatever you guys do! You guys are awesome for seeking your discomforts!!! <3
come to israel please. show the world what's happening! i beg you.
Some of us understand that you're upping the ante not because you want to enrich experiences but because you want to maintain the viewer count. I would never RISK my friend's safety through an unproven method just to make a buck. Fkn despicable.
Nothing says I'm your "best friend" besides literally risking their life without their knowledge. Such amazing friends for content!!
Im lost for words. Proud of you staffan
When Staffan landed, I started crying. I want to be this person, I want to stop my mind from having fear and pushing me back. You guys are so inspirational. All the love to you guys, God bless! ❤
Cap. World's most dangerous first skydive is done by yourself (no tandum) at the air force academy. Cool video though
USA/Colorado. My biggest discomfort, people. Im a nerd and getting out is pain. Meeting new people, making friends, finding things to bond over seems to be impossible. I hate going to work, I hate going to the store. I just hide in my house, working on my projects with printers and drones...Ive built a few drones and I cant find the will power to leave my house to explore with my drones...   I bought a condo in Jan. Im too bothered by people to have a house warming party. I seem to have zero power to setup a house part to celebrate the biggest/hardest purchase of my life....  alright, enough - I loved watching the video, I always do. The inspiration  I get from the music alone makes me feel better - every day.
As a Wingsuiter,  I can tell you these guys are well and truly next level!
I really want to try this kind of adventure but I am too scared .. so I must say that YOU ARE AMAZING ! Looking forward for more amazing videos ❤  Have a great day and keep on sharing !
Guys, I love how you support each other with so much love! Well done, Staffan, I felt with you all the way and cried with happiness when you landed! So happy for you and so inspiring for me!!!
This is awesome
i literally cried. This has been a rollercoaster of emotions
I was literally shaking watching this, that was a great idea and an adventure  👏👏
Well done Staffan! im currently planning my first skydive and this was a big inspiration to see you facing your fears :)
Tears in my eyes ❤
So moving i cried
Courtesy of Uli Emanuele... He died 7 years ago 😅
I want to skydive to celebrate my 30th birthday... to finally face my fear of heights...
I love you guys so much, now my dream is to skydive 🦅
This brought tears in my eyes. Such a beautiful emotion ❤
Every time I watch your videos I gain more hope ❤
Bawling! Well done Steffan! 🎉
Never tell Yes Theory your biggest fears lmao
Wow , Love you guys so much , maybe I would be little bit younger in the group but the vibe and love for friends and others you have made and shown is exactly what I try to do with my friends here . Maybe Hopefully I will get you meet you guys in person . I can truly resonate with you guys , Sending Love from the Himalayas
He's so brave for doing it and getting over his fear !
So we are not meeting Nicholas cage???
🎉🎉🎉😂😅😅😂🤡🤡 nicely done the whole video 📸👏👏👏📸
A truly beautiful video. so very cool
Staffan , what you did was my dream i want to fly.....
these videos make me feel so alive
Can we talk about the color grading tho!!!!!
🪂 Taking a leap of faith with Yes Theory and soaring through the skies together? That's the ultimate adventure I've been waiting for! I'm ready to embrace the unknown, conquer my fears, and create unforgettable memories. Let's redefine our limits and dive into life headfirst – all while spreading positivity and pushing boundaries with Yes Theory. Count me in for this exhilarating journey! 🌟 #YesTheorySkydive #SeekDiscomfort #AdventureAwaits
Beautiful Video I think the pandemic and the economic crisis have taught people how important multiple streams of income are, unfortunately having a job does not automatically mean financial security, I really appreciate the transparency and giving people a fighting chance in these difficult times
WOAHHHHH! Thank you guys for these videos! I want to live my life how you guys are living
This video inspired me to conquer my fear of heights.  Fear and anxiety are really just an illusion.  I believe the only way to get over it is by facing them head on and live on the edge.
I am from denmark and skydriving is a Big fear you guys are amazing 🎉❤
Wow.  You are guys so awesome to motivation 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Shit brought me to tears. Beautiful video boys ❤
Thank you SO MUCH for spreading such a powerful message. You are a true inspiration 🦅
i've got a teary eyes, I havent felt this for years. Truly inspirational,GOOD JOB STEFAN!!!
This gave me the courage to try skydiving with my dad for my 18th!!
What was the quote the instructor give to Staffan? Give presents to your emotions? Or presence?
And to finish I have been 160 lbs for over 5 years.. my brother's and sister father was from  Yemen and I raised them.. I am part native American so I could get just as dark in the summer to fit in lol
BTW. Having concured my fears I literally cried watching stephan land.. what a journey...
At 3:30, I felt like Nancy Pelosi at the State of the Union Address. 😊
I love this emotions in Staffan, guy is incredible and soo pure
Steffan you're so brave❤
I’m from Romania and my biggest discomfort or fear that I want to face is public speaking… it’s beyond a fear its genuinely something I don’t think I can or will ever overcome no matter how hard I try

I got sick before doing my first ever solo skydive, my goal before summer is over is to my first solo skydive!!
I have never wanted to skydive more haha. Also definitely trying Headspace for the first time!! Amazing video and inspiration
How many miles is this
Never have I felt this much fear for someone else Wow!
How the heck did you film that
❤️❤️❤️
i always seek discomfort i work at amazon lmao
I’ve started your seek discomfort package. I wanted to share with you the most rewarding aspect of receiving this package: gaining a profound understanding of my own discomfort. Throughout this journey, I've delved deep into my internal processes whenever I've encountered discomfort, striving to shift my perspective and embrace these feelings with a positive attitude. As I firmly believe, the most incredible experiences in life reside on the other side of fear. I am wholeheartedly committed to personal growth and crafting a more fulfilling life. Your inspiring presence has motivated me to evolve into a better version of myself each day!  With gratitude, Ashley  By the way I’m from the USA 😊
this has me on cloud nine! ✈️ It's like witnessing a breathtaking dance with the heavens. 🕊️💨 You've reignited my dream of soaring through the skies! ✨
In tears! ❤️ Makes me wanna do it even more - thank you for sharing an incredible moment!! Love from Norway🇳🇴
words cant even describe how happy i am for you
Well done steffan! You did such an incredible job despite having so much fear ❤❤❤❤
Yes ,  My humble request to you please visit once  India and explore our adorable monuments established in North India and our eastern Region.
I might be over-interpreting things, but at 7:25 it his face already looks like something in him changed forever. Like a little bit of a mask he used to put on - as we all do - dropped in the face of the inevitable conquering of a life long fear
crazy men do crazy things, love it
Man I would LOVE to skydive. I’m in the UK if your looking to take some subscribers😏
❤🇩🇰❤️ Denmark
And just think a short  ago you guys didn't know Staffan, he's been such a great fit to the Yes Fam 🫶🏽
This is so inspiring. I myself have insane height fear and I think in that situation I'll just pass out and wake up after all the fun part is over. This shows me a lot that I have to start getting out of my comfort zone to the point that I don't feel scared/uncomfortable doing them. Greetings from Greece!
The biggest phobia i have is thalassophobia, last year i sat down on a chair to see my friends swimming in loktak lake, Manipur, India. I wish i didn't have that fear.
Stop using fish eye lens 😂
The first Muslim to fly First..
I AM FROM INDIA AND MY DISCOMFORT IS ALSO SCARE FROM HEIGHTS  YES THEORY💙💙
This was an amazing episode, super proud of Stefan!!
☮️💙♐ positive energy always creates elevation. So grateful for your platform 💥💥💥💣💣💣
You guys are amazing! Over coming fears every day! This is one thing I’d love to do but having kids and a family everything always go to them first, but hopefully one day I’ll get the chance to sky dive 🤞🏽
Way to go Steffan!! What an inspiration you are! So proud of you!!
Amazing!! I was so moved!! Shalom from Israel
This made me 😭. Thank you Yes Theory for being an inspiration and really happy for you Staffan❣️🤗❣️
11:00
why am i crying lol
YESSSSS!! ❤👏 🙌
I love how everyone supported for one of the team members experience good little family you guys built
“So we’re not meeting Nicolas Cage?” 😂
this video was amazing i felt like i was flying too. truly inspiring work
Hey, as a 17 years old I have al ways had one dream. that is to complete a triathlon. The only thing that keeps me from doing it is the fear of the water. I am not afraid of not be able to swim all the way. And I also don’t have them courage to sign up to a triathlon so I can set a date. It will be hard but I hope some day that I will make it.🙏
My life is being overtaken by fear of heights as a kid I was fearless and would jump off high places but one dream ruined everything. Once I had a dream I was walking on a crane and was about to fall since then the fear of height kept growing  but I promised when I can and if I get the right support I want to do bungee jumping sky diving etc
Shoutout to Abbas
LoL you told him you were seeing Nicholas Cage to lure him out there 😂😂😂
Face Everything And Rise! 💪🏽🙏🏽🔥
The best things with this video😂❤
The only way to find comfort is from Jesus
It is seriously impossible not to love Staffan! ❤ As a swede myself, I WISH there were so many more people like him here. Du är bäst, Staffan! ❤
Not me tearing up the second that door opened! You're video give me so much hope for my future and what's to come! Keeping those mottos in my life from now on and forever! Thank you YES THEORY!!
This video is absolutely perfect. This editing skills are awesome, it felt like I was there.
That was amazing thank you
Seems a lot like bullying tbh
I tried on headspace and it seems nice, I am terrified from sky diving but this video inspire me for it, I live in Iraq for now and ready for an adventure with you guys, best team ever -
This was absolutely amazing! Staffan at the end when he asked if someone could just hold him ❤️ friendships like the ones in yes theory are so valuable in life and I aspire to find some people like this
Face Everything And Rise ! BRAVO STAFFAN ! Cheers and Love from Montréal, Québec, Canada, where all this started !
You guys really inspired me when I was in a dark place! I explore every single day and make films because of you guys! Your work is so beautiful and I dream to live a life like you guys. Thanks for everything you do
Missed out on the 60 days- but I’m doing the 30 days! I’ve never been so inspired by a group of people. I wear my love over fear hoodie and it reminds me of everything I’ve ever learned through you guys. Much love from Canada 🇨🇦. You guys are incredible. ✨ I can only imagine the fear Staffan was feeling- as I’m TERRIFIED of heights. Haha.. Well done.
Staffan after this experience is balder than before.
I really enjoy the new guy
When I started subscribing to this channel years ago, I loved the message. Shortly after I subscribed, someone spontaneously asked me to go skydiving the next day. My brain was telling me hell no, but I paused and slowly said "suuure...". When the door opened of the plane filled me with fear and away we went. I'm happy it's off my bucket list and happy that I said yes instead of no.
You are kinda overdramtic
I have the same fears. skydiving is one of  my biggest fears because I keep thinking to myself that the parachute won't work and ill be the unfortunate one that dies while doing this. This was super motivational, and the fact that he overcame his fear was empowering. I cant say this helps ease my fear of dying, but it definitely makes me want to push myself to do this. the day I skydive will be the say I can truly say I have seemed discomfort. I've been in many uncomfortable situations, but this would be it. the day I do this I will hold my seek discomfort flag and say I finally did it but until then, I have to try and convince myself that I won't be the 1 in a million.
Yes theory would have said yes to getting on the submarine
insane
I watch Yes Theory too much! I wish my life could be paused to experience these things!
started it skydive calm
Thank you.
I started the Seek Dicomfort Package! I am sick of being in my small childhood town where i grew up in. I am starting to travel the world in a few months only with my backpack. I started a YouTube Channel where i most of the time scared to press publish because of the opinion of others, which haunts me everyday. i try to overcome it but i didnt post in a while which makes me sick from the inside out. im trying my best and some day i'll be there. some day i will produce the videos i always wanted to create! idk if this gets attention but i honestly dont care, i write this comment for myself to get it out there in the world and dont get picked on because i try to accomplish something in my life. the change the yes theory brings to the world is just phenomenal. you guys are literally changing the world for the better. it might seem not that big of a deal sometimes but i am sure there are a lot quite viewers (like me) that gets inspired by your content, by your way to do things, that they go out for themselves and seek discomfort to change there own life to something better, something bigger.   P.S: the now already legendary quote from Staffan: "A head full of fear, has no space for dreams." resonated so deeply with me that i already see my own problems and im going after them! thanks for everything you guys are the best! much love from germany ❤
would dare to become an eagle with your mindset guys, majestic work. thanks for meditations Thomas :)
I'm from POLAND and my discomfort is conquiring heights and i want to experience a skydive so much, it would be incredible to win this challenge, really believe it!
There's a reason why this channel gets such little views
I love that you told ibn fernas’s story
hey guys I am going to skydive in 1 week in Spain and i am as scared as Staffan so if Staffan can give me some words of courage and tell me how he concorde this fear then it would be really helpful. Love from India
Isnt this a little cruel? I feel like he couldnt say no
“a head full of fears has no space for dreams” I LOVE THAT
what an amazing video, wow! thank you
I would like to meet Nicholas Cage with Tommy
Am from kenya...and a big fun of you guys, my greattest wish is just see you visiting my country and have one of the fantastic things, rinding on a matatu....best expirience ever🎉🎉
Everytime I see you traveling to Switzerland, I wish I could meet you. I am bedbound so I'm not able to go out and meet people at all. I can't seek discomfort in that way, yet my whole life is a constant discomfort. More than that, it's constant pain. Most of the time I have to lay very still and in the dark. I hope it will be better one day and that I'll actually be able to meet some of you and do something crazy together. The best place for it to happen for me would be Switzerland or Egypt. Love both of these countries. I'll keep dreaming. :)
I love the videos and message but I feel like longer videos exploring more things about the places you visit would go a long way. I can see 10m+ views if these were 1 hour + videos.
SO BREATHTAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL. MADE ME WEEP. I AM CRIPPLE.  IF YOU HAVE YOUR ABLE BODY AND YOUR SENSES, DON'T LET FEAR ROB YOU OF THE EXPERIENCE OF YOUR LIFE. IT'S NOT A TEST RUN. GREAT VIDEO. ❤
I’m from Miami , I’m currently facing a fear of open waters. You guys are my biggest inspiration to face my fears and make the best out of every day that passes🥺
I am from The Netherlands. And the biggest discomfort this year is leaving school even though I did not finish it in a traditional sense (no degree) and choosing not to get a traditional job either. Instead I choose to trust a new path that is being forged by will and determination. (i did download headspace using the code) thanks for the inspiration guys, always. 🎉🙏🍀
Yes theory will never get old
I have debilitating anxiety, to the point it controls me and very aspiration I have. I have never been on a plane, I don't do much besides what feels comfort. This video made me bawl my eyes out, he is completely right that a head full of fears has no space for dreams. I truly hope I get the courage to overcome my anxiety so I can live more like y'all do
my discomfort is getting my full drivers licence in bc canada
I am from Switzerland and i again noticed how beautiful Switzerland is. Love the Videos over the Years and keep up the Great Work thanks for everithing you guys did for us and all support from the yes family Realy proud of steffan. :)
This video was so inspiring! And it made me like Staffan even more. Now he truly lives up to his many life mottos. And I liked the whole Nicolas Cage lie.
I literally creid watching this video ❤😍 My dream is to become skydiver and want to do jump from stratosphere. Hope I'll do it one day 😇
A few tears came over me after watching this! I’ve been skydiving 18 times but it’s been 3 years since I’ve been!!! It’s scary but made me feel so alive! I remember my first time jumping with my own parachute I cried in the plane and rode the plane down. Then about 5 hours later I jumped and when I landed I had happy tears!! This was very beautiful! I love facing my fears! Next month I’m getting scuba certified because I’m scared of it! Just like I got skydive certified!!
Not a single one of your videos goes by without encouraging me to say yes to this world and face the discomfort that comes my way. I am so moved by everything you guys accomplish and set out for others. I have a fear of flying, it is what I wrote my college essay on, and it has many times sent me into a spiral of anxiety, panic, and fear so uncomfortable it is unimaginable. Yet I chose to go to a school I had to fly to and from to get home, and I never shy away from any flights because I refuse to let it control my life, all thanks to you guys. ❤ I started the headspace package and can’t wait to use it on my next flight… :)
I'm from bangladesh but i live in denmark. My biggest fear has always been water. i was so scared of drowning. but i want to go in the water and learn how to swim.
Would be cool to see you guys go out try and convince someone to let you host a yes table pop up in there yard or at there house. That video was epic
Yes theory channel has inspired me alot to overcome the challenges I face. After 2020 lockdown I was fighting opiod addiction for nearly 2 years, on and off. Some of your videos helped me through it as I said to myself "Seek Discomfort, overcome the pain so that you can be better". Now that I've been clean for more than 6 months I really look forward to helping others who are going through the same as I did back then.  I seek challenges everyday and no matter how hard they are I always try to get through it. Someday I Hope to meet you guys and thank you in person as your channel have profoundly affected me and my perspective towards life in the most positive way. Love from NE. India 🇮🇳  ❤
I cried like I gave birth to you, Staffan. Super duper crazzzyyy YES maaaan. You are right where u belong. 👏❤️✨
just the feel good video i needed
I am from Minneapolis, USA. I’ve been a fan for years and currently live in Jigjiga, Ethiopia. I would love to invite yes theory here. Then we can go to Harar, Ethiopia and feed trained heyanas face to face loool. Just YouTube “feeding heynas harar” 😅
im from the uk but heading to australia the end of this month. take me skydiving for the first time!
One of your greatest ever videos. Truly inspiring and uplifting ❤
That was emotional. Damn.
My God, I got chills during this video! What an amazing experience for Steffan! He seeked discomfort coming to America 🇺🇸 And now became an Eagle!🦅 Keep flying Steffan, don't become a turkey 🦃 lol
amazing video!!! i think its time for another internet scandal like the bieber burrito!!!
So proud of Staffan for facing his fears and inspiring others to do the same. Congrats, from another "Steve" ;)
Am I the only one crying? I've got goosebumps cuz i'd never do that for life but only seeing him doing it makes me feel alive
You guys really amazing helped plenty people seeking discomfort❤️♥️
Damn guys 🎉 I can't remember when I had so much good emotions because of YouTube video. Your content are amazing I love it. And because off you I ordered my first jump with parachute even I am not comfortable with it 😂 thank you😅
Hello everyone reading this, Im Roberto and i lived in Las Vegas, Nevada from 2-20 years old and at the end of April i decided to move to Minnesota after getting a good job offer out here. I know its way different especially the weather, culture, and the fact that none of my friends or family are coming with me, but i’ve been invested in this channel for years so i decided to say yes, seek discomfort, and pack my things to drive out here the last weekend of April. I still don’t have a place to stay, but luckily my uncle lives three hours away so i can stay with him on weekends and this job comes with a lot of traveling so most of the hotel rooms i stay at aren’t coming out of my pocket. I’ve made two friends at the hotel I stayed at here in Owatonna, MN. They were at the front checking people in and I asked for recommendations of places to eat. That itself was scary and took me three “car trips” to ask, but it ended up turning into a really long conversation and it was so much fun. It turned out we had a lot in common like going to the gym and one of them was semi-new to town too. I even told them about yes theory because they brought up how i was really doing what my hoodie said “SEEK DISCOMFORT” after i told them how i was going to be moving to the area soon, and i didn’t know anyone. If it wasn’t for me watching Yes theory for so long and loving the positivity and messages they spread, i never would’ve accepted the job or been here today. Im extremely grateful and do my best to help spread the core principals of yes theory: say yes, seek discomfort, and love over fear. And of course spreading positivity. :) Thank you for taking the time to read this if you made it this far.
3:08 Ammar is such a charismatic and believable person that I'm glad he's using his gifts for good lol.
Honduras
This video made me remember when you made Derin face his fear of heights by jumping off a cliff into a lake. The new stakes just show how far this channel has gone
it's really incredible how much bond is created between you guys while doing stuff like that, sending your friends into space and waiting for their return, enriched with an unique experience strenghtens so much between each of you. i'd love to have the opportunity to once share something familiar with my friends. lets try out that seek discomfort package.
This video actually made me cry, I wish I could be as brave as you guys, I have agoraphobia and a panic disorder and am basically housebound due to my own phobias and fears, but watching your videos gives me hope that one day I might be able to battle my own discomfort even if it does have to be just one small step at a time. So thank you from the bottom of my heart. ❤️
Proud of you man
This film. This group of people. You are changing the world. You are touching souls in such visceral levels. I love everything this channel represents. The messages of humanity are the most authentic & true. Thank you for all that you do ❤️
I’m from Ethiopia and my discomfort is skydiving
This video is so beautiful on so many levels ❤
I have been following your channel for almost 7 years and I have never been disappointed by any of the videos that you guys made. It has been such a ride and I am extremely happy that I could always get inspired by your videos and share the love over fear, seek discomfort and yes theory philosophy! Love it soo much! I have also started the SEEKDISCOMFORT PACKAGE! Thank you for everything that you guys are doing for the world, the community and the young people! Greetings from Slovakia! Until we see each other, wish you all the best! Peter :)
These kids think their like philosophers
Bro y’all videos are so cringe like stop crying trying to make motivational shit in the vid like akward cringe button here
Amazing 🤣
Thank you! I can breathe 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Day 505. Waiting for YES THEORY to fulfill my wish. From the Philippines.🇵🇭
The love they all have for eachother is so cute
oh god I literally felt the nervousness he had because I have the same fear MUCH LOVE FROM IRAN
Oh my.. I cried really.. What an experience.. I am afraid of heights as well.. Oh myyyy!! 😮❤
🥺🥺🥺🥺
Amazing video! it made me think that it would be amazing to see a member of yes theory do free climbing
Amazing ❤
I would love to have that fear taken out of me by skydiving. Love you too June.
I am terrified I’m skydiving if I did it tandem and I would love it. I live in Oakland, California.
You guys are the best,  steffan you crazy man are cool as heck :))
Day 504. Waiting for YES THEORY to fulfill my wish. From the Philippines.🇵🇭
This is awesome! I to have a discomfort i would like to seek but i know is not possible. I would like to jump from the edge of space, just like felix baumgartner did back in 2012. Theres something so surreal about freefall.
“A head full of fears has no space for dreams”
imagine having a friends like them 🥲🥲🥲🥲
Yes Theory should start a skateboarding challenge. It's so hard to learn, painful, and millions things can make you want to quit. They should feature with Braille or smthing.
Pure goosebumps
Truly amazed by you guys. This is what life's truly meant to be. I startet my seek discomfort package - (i am also afraid of hights but open to face every fear).
I’m from Lebanon 🇱🇧
Dear Yes Theory, As someone who struggles with extreme anxiety and depression, seeking discomfort is one of the hardest things for me to do. Simply getting up in the morning or going out to get a coffee can seem intimidating. To experience the level of pure freedom that Staffan experienced after his freefall feels so far out of my reach, but you guys have truly motivated me, with this video especially, to try to face my fears, no matter how minor those fears may be. I hope to one day be free, and with the help of your channel I finally feel like I have a chance at doing that. So thank you. I appreciate all of you so much; Staffan, Ammar, Thomas, Tommy, and the rest of the Yes Theory team. I am headed to Headspace right now to start my journey there. It has always been on my bucket list to skydive since I was a kid, but I haven't gained the courage yet. It would be a dream to one day fly like an eagle with you guys if you are ever in the SF Bay. Keep doing what you do, so many people are inspired by your work! Wish all of you the best.
Forcing someone to go through a life-threatening experience through peer pressure isn't something to be celebrated
Hey yestheory I’m from Texas and I’ve been a subscriber since before I can remember y’all are the craziest group of people I’ve ever seen on YouTube by FAR recently I’ve been working on some of the biggest challenges I’ve ever been through with employment and finding purpose however y’all’s videos are what got me through my darkest times just wanna say thanks
Day 503. Waiting for YES THEORY to fulfill my wish. From the Philippines.🇵🇭
Does anybody know where in Switzerland is this? I'm guessing near the Grindelwald area.
Hi im from the US. This year i'm looking to overcome my discomfort in believing in myself. Throughout my life i've always had doubts about my self and that i'm never good enough.
amazing <3
It sounds sht but I’m from the Netherlands and after two years I’m finally daring myself to overcome my fear of failure 🎉
Skydiving is so much fun wish I could do the wing suit one
I got chills when Staffan said "a head full of fears has no space for dreams" and I am seriously considering getting a tattoo of that quote as it resonates with me so much. PLEASE make merch with that quote on it.
Day 502. Waiting for YES THEORY to fulfill my wish. From the Philippines.🇵🇭
Signed up for headspace 💛💛💛 And trying seek discomfort series!!
I remember the old title
What a flip! What a surprise, damn
Hello, do you want to come to Yemen and explore new places? I will arrange everything for that
Just cause it sounds good, doesn't mean its true. Fear of death can definitely keep you alive and keep you from doing dangerous things that can kill you.
This channel makes so much down to earth videos from this channel we can see the real beauty of the earth and nature ❣️
beautiful
cool
I couldn’t stop crying since they opened the door to jump 😭😭 I know I wanna seek discomfort and have adventures like that!! I felt Steffan’s fear and excitement coz I have the same fear! And I was cheering with you guys ! Thanks for making me feel the way I feel now ❤ keep doing what you do❤
Im from the Bay Area in California and I am only 16 years old and my discomfort is to go skydiving but it is hard to get done at such a young age.
Day 501. Waiting for YES THEORY to fulfill my wish. From the Philippines.🇵🇭
I am from the united states and I am looking to ride a bull!
That was incredible, seek disconfort ✨️✨️
I'm from Poland and I'm seeking to try the world's most spicy chilli.
Do a video going to socotra!
I would love to do something like this! I’ve been skydiving and it was incredible but this is another level. So cool!
Day 500. Waiting for YES THEORY to fulfill my wish. From the Philippines.🇵🇭
Im from Switzerland. I hope I could meet you!
A lie within a lie within a lie – Lieception!
so that was what feels ike being alive.
Hey guys thank you for sharing with us this type of experience and even more the headspace special edition Seeking Discomfort wow is amazing make me think deeply about vulnerability in my life. already finished the first day and I’m going to continue tomorrow. A disclaimer for the free Skydive: I’m from Dominican Republic and I have B1/B2 visa 😇
I just subscribed. I love all of you. You enlighten the world. Positivity and guidance. Much love.
Hi, im sorry, but is anyone else struggling with the code for Headspace?  Sending lots of love, Eva:)
my dis-comfort is living in poverty and worthlessnes starts hiting you your life becoms hard
Everyone on the channel are great people and inspiring.  I want to experience the things you guys do
Great video - Inspirational. I'm from the US, and this summer I'm walking 486mi from Denver to Durango, CO on the Colorado Trail. There will be highs and lows as well as discomfort and inspiration on the trail. #thetrailprovides
I have started
Commenting until we get to have holly back
Really loved the authenticity and love shown in the video! Stefan you are such a beautiful soul! I’m from Melb Australia and the discomfort I’m seeking this year is running my first marathon! it is sure to be a challenge but I’m sure the breath work and mindfulness skills from the Headspace program will be very valuable! Thank you again for the wonderful video! :)
Love the content. Factually sound
I always say that skydiving is the one thing that I know that I'm gonna die without doing, this made me reconsider (still super afraid though)
This video made me feel so mall and powerful..... I have so much to achieve by overcoming my shortcomings and fears and what not. The journey of this video is so inspiring.
17 minutes of build up for 2 minutes of the title what a garbage video
When he started force throwing up 🤣🤣. We all know that feeling
How can you not love Staffan? ❤
I'm from Germany and my discomfort is that I'm going to submit a very personal book I wrote to a Young storyteller contest. I write for a year and always have new ideas and finally decided to submit one. It's about my time in school and how I struggled with mental health, school pressure and what effects the right mindset in my life had:)
Peer pressure at its finest!! disgusting way of welcoming someone in like college frats hazing to prove a point...shame on you for putting him up against the wall..just because thats how u overcame something doesnt mean others will..the pain i felt for him when he PHYSICALLY was overwhelmed hurt
He definitely did the “barrghell rrgholl”. 😃
This is so inspirational. I am ruled by fear, and this makes me want to change that. Thank you guys. Thank you so much.
just found this channel, would be great to have no more fear in live. Just live and enjoy. greetz from Belgium
amazing guys lots of love from Kathmandu 🇳🇵♥️
Skydiving change my life and has changes a lots of people’s life’s. 1157 jumps and more to go

Day 498. Waiting for YES THEORY to fulfill my wish. From the Philippines.🇵🇭
I am also afraid of heights and never tried anything which comes with height
beatiful episode
I'm Ola from Poland. And of my biggest fear is driving a car. I travel around the world alone, i drop stable well paying job to pursuit building a personal brand and freelancer business, but i'm terryfied with situations on the road. I afraid so much that i have never even tried to do driving license. The fear became even bigger when i was driving motorcycle in Indonesia and had accident.  Not only i harmed myself but i also harmed my friend. And i feel responsible for this.  The other time i was passing the road and someone on motorcycle hit me. So i became even more afraid.   Im tired of this fear, i don't want it to control me anymore and limit my possibilities and i decided i will do the driving license this year. And I have additional motivation. Next year with my friend we want to travel by car from Spain to Mauretania and do cargo train ride there. She told me she need me to become a driver. She can't be only one. So far i made just tiny step towards it by contacting driving schools. And this week I want to sign up for a course.   P.S When i was writing this i checked the text in translating tool to see if there are any errors. And you know what? It translated "terryfied with situations on the road" to "im really good at managing situations on the road". And second time it translated it to "i'm not afraid of situations on the road" ❤  I will treat this as afirmation and make it reality! With Headspace and your course there it will be easier.   P.S 2 Watching Steffan confronting his fear I felt that fear. I have been nervous and i even felt heavy on the chest. But he confronted it, so i can do it as well 💪
Amazingly fantastic!
“A head full of fear has no space for DREAMS!” That hit me so hard and something I needed to hear right now in life as I have a head full of fear about leaving everything I know for a new chapter in life. I found your page yesterday and I feel like you’ve already had an impact on my life. Thank you for that. I needed that cry, and I needed that clarity.
Have loved every single one of your guys videos, the amount of effort and time you put into them is incredible. When r you guys gonna go explore the ocean in a submarine ?
We Love Staffan!
I'm crying because of happiness. Thank you, yes theory.
This is the channel of which videos I’ve cried the most. I have a crying streak. The most biggest thank you for what you guys do and making it possible to expierience these journeys with you through emotions and discomfort seeking. We all grow together.  I come from a small country Latvia, been watching your videos for the longest time, extremely grateful for all the free headspace subrictions and knowledge as well. Flying to me associates with complete surrender and ableness to just let the wind take you. Thats why birds are here to remind us just that. As I’ve started the package and cried my eyes out, I’ll let this video sink in.  All love🌱☀️
I felt it all. Leave with tears and full heart❤
Hi...I am from Slovakia and my discomfort for this year is frelly coming and talking to unknown people anywhere anytime !!!
This was one of the most impactful episodes so far imo, just amazing that he pushed through and actually did it. Amazing.
Come to india
What a great experience by staffan conquered his fear and have great friends like tommy, thomas, and ammar. These guys is my inspiration on making documentary or film in our school. I love you guyss!!! From Cebu, Philippines. Hopefully i can meet you guys in the future!
Dear Staffan and the Yes Theory Fam,  I wanted to take a moment to congratulate you on your incredible skydiving experience! The courage, determination, and sense of adventure you all displayed in leaping into the unknown is truly inspiring.  Skydiving is not just a physical experience but a mental one. It requires a willingness to step outside your comfort zone and confront your fears head-on. By doing so, you have demonstrated an incredible amount of strength and resilience, and you have shown that anything is possible if you believe in yourself and your abilities.  I hope your skydiving experience has left you feeling empowered, invigorated, and ready to take on whatever challenges come your way. Remember, life is an adventure, and the only way to truly experience it is to take risks and embrace new opportunities.  So, congratulations again on your extraordinary and successful skydiving experience. Keep pushing yourself to new heights, and never forget the incredible strength and courage that you possess.  Best wishes, Joenas
Love Yes Theory. Not a big fan of them promoting headspace though. Commercialising something that should be free and has been free for centuries. Try Medito instead.
That was extraordinary😮
I did this in New Zealand in the Bay of Islands, first jump from 20,000 feet. Incredible
this is one of the things i want to experience, hope i will have the opportunity one of these days
I cried so much watching 🥺🥺🥺 so incredible of Staffan. I also have a huge fear of heights, so watching this made me really nervous, but once he jumped it made me really emotional. This video made me feel all sorts of things. Thank you for taking us along another incredible adventure.
Merci pour le code promo bien hate dessayer ca
Im from 🇺🇸 and my discomfort is presenting a lecture at a big conference at the end of the year.
Yes Steffan!!! feeling so happy and proud of you watching this. what an amazing thing. So inspiring thank you. well done for facing those fears brother. so much love x
7 months ago I fulfilled a dream of mine that I've had since I was 16 and moved to Spain from the US. I had to leave my entire family behind, sacrifice my well-paying job, and sell almost all of my possessions. It's not been easy, but getting out of my comfort zone in this way has been totally worth it, and I also just started the Seek Discomfort package on Headspace. I'd love to go sky-diving for the first time too - it's been on my bucket list for years! ♥
Congratulations 🎉🎊‼️I’m happy for you 😃👍‼️
Amazing!! Your videos are always so inspiring ❤
No money
Hi everyone! I'm from Egypt and the discomfort I'm seeking this year is solo travelling the world. Being a solo travelling female coming from my culture, has never felt like a very easy feat. It's really tough trying to break the barriers of fear that were so deeply ingrained in me and anyone like me. So, I'm deciding to break through that mold, and stop giving those fears the mic.   Taking action won't be easy but I'm excited to see where this new road takes me.   I have actually already started the year with two international solo trips back to back to some very new and far places, and already planning for my next one.   I'm just starting your package on Headspace, because I know that no other group would understand the "head space" I'm in right now more than Yes Theory!   It's insane watching this video because I've dreamt of Skydiving, and even getting a license for it for so long, but it always seems out if reach. Watching Staffan on this wild ride reminded me that the sky itself isn't out of reach, so why would anything else be? ✨
I did it exactly in the same spot, exactly with the same team so I know what you guys felt here 💙  Congrats on this beautiful challenge guys !
Hello Yes Theory I am from South Africa. I have never left the country, I am very afraid of meeting new people. I really would like to see how I would do If I found myself in a different country where I would be forced to interact with people.
Fantastic. Sure made me feel good!  Takes some courage!
Guys how is it possible that you put me in every video from u in tears ?  :) I love your contend so much.... please never stop !
Next seek discomfort shirt “you can’t fly like an eagle if you sound yourself with turkeys “ Tommy
I felt so invigorated watching this video … Skydiving is one of my dreams
Instead of yes theory, these guys should now be known as blessed army… they are living dreams of so many people and making world a better place to live.. thank you so much
❤️❤️
Day 497. Waiting for YES THEORY to fulfill my wish. From the Philippines.🇵🇭
What's the intro song title?
I took this video as my sign to use the code and finally start meditating daily and work through my fear of being inadequate! Hello from the USA 😊
This is insane, a stranger who you met on the street is pure Yes Theory. Putting himself past discomfort without question. I've never seen such bravery. Amazing as always.
Staffan! Världens bästa Staffan! Oh my, this episode was again truly amazing, and I couldn't be happier for you!! I feel with you on everything you have ever said about skydiving prior to, as I'm also so unbelievable scared of heights, and I kid you not, my eyes watered up when you hit ground again 🫶 Thank you for this video Yes Fam!  And yes, this video and your words definitely makes me want to try and push through one day to do a skydive! Thank you, thank you, thank you 🌟
This is called living. Thank you Yes Theory!   Ammar, you are such as wonderful soul, I hope to meet you one day.
So great! I needed the reminder to face my fears today. I haven’t started the package yet, but plan to. I’m from the U.S currently in Stockholm. I don’t know what the future holds, but am living in the present making the most of the time I have. I’d love to meet you guys one day, but more importantly to seek discomfort and grow. Cheers!
do i hear a new seek discomofrt series? Face Everything And RIse clothing?
amazing
I will do this one day
You guys always seem to deliver whenever you're away for a while. It's good to see you guys active on youtube again! I am an Indian and I've been studying in the UK for a few months now.   basically gambled a secure future from my previous studied to something that I love doing but is going be very difficult to get a stable job. But the thing is..... I've never been happier and I think you guys have play a little part in it as well. This has been the greatest decision I've ever taken in my life so keep inspiring people and never stop seeking discomfort. :) Love, Rishabh V.
This is so touching and inspiring. Fear is nothing when we let go and take control of it. Well done, Staffan ❤
Awesome video, as always. The stuff you and the rest of the guys have done (especially the cold exposure!) is something I'd like to start trying.  Been going thru a lot lately, and stress levels are astronomically high now and hopefully your videos in Headspace with Dora get me back to my feet. Cheers from a warm and toasty Manila 🌞
I wanna do that
This was Amazing!! So happy for you Staffan :) You inspire me always. Even though they brought you there you could've still been a turkey but decided to seek discomfort and became an eagle 🔥 So proud of you! My goal this year is to become a professional public speaker and credit YesTheory a lot for helping me get to where I am today in my mindset. Coupled with Headspace I know I'll get there :D
Im from Nepal. Im really scared of heights but I want to try and bungee jump :)
I can finally say the old yes theory days are back showcasing the actuall seek discomfort. I still remember you made Stephan switch with another guy , and stephan giving the public speach. Thanks guys bringing it back. SeekDiscomfort although i am still in my comfort zone. hehe. Love you guys.
i don't really have a fear of heights but that view from the heli made me think I did. you're so brave steffan and you inspire me to do things outside my comfort zone. WWSD- what would steffan do!!
Howdie😂😂, I'm actually from IRI (Iran) I'm 22 and I'm gonna actually try to enter hardcore teaching-business. I'm gonna be an English teacher😁
You did it man.❤❤❤
sky dive i ma skydive this year real sooooooooon pulling my shit and fears  together from kenya
❤
I'm from France, Toulouse and my discomfort this year will be running a marathon 🤞🏻
"A head full of fears. Has no space for dreams"
WHERE'S MATT
Amazing!
"Can someone just hold me?" Oh Staffan you are a beautiful soul!
Wow! I did not expect to fell all that emotion. When he got to the ground and gave Amar a hug I was 😢 Stefon you are so brave you are incredible
Day 496. Waiting for YES THEORY to fulfill my wish. From the Philippines.🇵🇭
At this point there's no Yes Theory. This is just rich kid activity for YouTube.
Energy got me❤
I wish I could fly. 😊
Anyone know what brand sunglasses Ammar is wearing? 🔥
The ending made me tear up! Well done Steffan!!!
Congratulations Steffan! So proud and happy for you! I could feel my heart race just seeing you do it.
CONGRATS ON THE VIDEO. WHAT YOU DO IS AMAZING, VERY INSPIRING AND WILL ALWAYS KEEP THE CONCEPTS AND VALUES YOU PREACH IN MY HEART
Hej! I am a Moroccan living in Sweden, and I wish to try the craziest and unimaginable seek discomfort activity you all guys can come up with! I know I am gonna be hell scared, but I want to face my fears and see where my true potential can get without fears! Best regards! Abderrahman
I cry every time I see a Yes Theory video when someone faces their fears… when they “face everything and rise” :)
I absolutely teared up seeing how amazing Steffan felt after landing. I wish I could make my first jump just like that too. Ever since I was a kid I felt like I was a bird in my previous life because i always dreamt and thought of floating and flying in the air. Thank you for your headspace episodes and I live in Virginia, US. Thanks for the 60 days guys. Love these videos
Hi @yestheory, my name is Nidal Ahmed and I am from India. Currently I am in the UAE, working as a salesman. My biggest fear is the same as Stefan's, Acrophobia. Seeing Stefan conquer his biggest fear, made me realize I should do it too. It would be an honour to do it with you guys.
17:40 Video Starts
Bravest person ever.  The world owes you a cookie!
So emotional
20kft is about as tall as the tallest mountains. Crazy distance
My dream was to be a pilot but they didn’t except me because i was overweight now I lost weight but I missed the chance to be a pilot. I hope to not lose this chance and do skydiving
Literally cried, love the energy love how he has tackled his fear, love yes theory ❤
My palms were sweating and my heart was racing as I started watching this
Wow, just watching gave me the good feelings
As I was watching this video I felt so choked up as I was imagining how Staffan was feeling at that very moment. It also made me think about the discomfort I'll be seeking this year: I got an offer from my job, which I've been doing for 12 years, since I was just 16 years old. They offered to cover my bills for the coming 12 months so I could be free to go and do whatever I want, because they know this job wasn't making me happy. I'm beyond grateful for these people in my life making this possible ❤ so now the question is; what adventures will I be going on in the coming 12 months? Maybe you guys could give me some inspiration 👀?
Staffan is soo pure, really happy to see him happy. I'm from Egypt and I'm seeking a social media detox this year, I wish I was seeking bigger things but I know I can't at the moment. hope one day to be as you guys, all the love <3
wow
Heeey, I’m recent subscriber from this amazing channel, seek discomfort has changed my life. Im from Honduras, but I’m studying in Lithuania, away from friends and family, so I’ve been seeking discomfort years ago JAJAJA. The discomfort I’m seeking is skydiving, since watching Ammar and his experience, I’ve been fascinated of the fact of flying, but I’m really scare of heights, I haven’t even tried a rollercoaster for the same fact. So if I have the opportunity, I’ll be grateful ❤  Pd: I started today the seek discomfort package!
You are so amazing, you have helped my anxiety so much and I am forever grateful.
Amazing!!! Would love to get over my fear and sky dive with you. Love from Israel❤
hi i'm 17 and im  from Philippines im discomfort of  deep ocean
Great jof steffan!!!
I got to know you guys through people I met while seeking discomfort, travelling alone, and trying to make friends, which ended up happening so nicely. Today watching Staffan skydiving, I've learned that knowing how to breathe is just something that I needed in my life, and that's why I decided to use Headspace and start using your package as it seems very beneficial. Thanks for being out there guys and well done Staffan!
Good to see I was not the only one crying while watching this video. I went solo skydiving 8 times in summer 2022, unfortunately weather, schedule and (mostly) fear have been preventing me to jump again ever since. But watching this episode... Man, I still remember to this day how I felt after every jump. Just like Staffan: on the other side of your biggest fear... are the most blissful feelings and moments of your life.  I'm French and even after 8 skydiving jumps, I still cannot embrace my fear of heights. But this video motivated me so much to go back and skydive. And also try wingsuit one day.   Thank you YES THEORY. Your content, your community, your spirit, your mindset... All that is a true blessing to humanity.
cause..........zindagi na milegi dobara!!!
Such an amazing video seeing Staffan conquer his biggest fear, inspiring to watch! I’ve also started my 60 day Headspace trial and have got my fingers crossed for my first skydive so I can be free like an eagle too
This is so powerful! I wrote this down on a piece of paper and put it on my desk as a daily reminder - "A head full of fears has no space for dreams". I'm seeking discomfort by speaking up and doing things differently. I've spent years just trying to conform and that feels comfortable. Now let's make some dreams happen!
YESS FAMMM ASSEMBLEEE!! ❤
Amazing video as always❤ I have started the Seek Discomfort package on headspace I have been meditating for some years on and off. I want to commit and put it in a daily practice. Thank you for all your work and making the world a better place.🙏
I absolutley love you guys! True inspiration of my life! I am from Estonia and this year I am seeking the discomfort of graduating from high school and starting my life "as an adult". I feel tremendeus pressure and anxiety about all of it but Yes Theory keeps reminding me to keep living in the moment, enjoying my life and trying not to worry too much about certain things, but instead seek discomfort and face my fears, all for a fulfilling and amazing life.
Just got headspace and can’t wait! Not sure how to use the code for the 60 days!! HELP 😅 also I’d be terrified to skydive but I’d do it in a heartbeat, Stefan’s mind is so strong!
Amazing experience but it’s not cheap!
Another yes theory video that has me crying! So proud of you Stefan 🤍
“Fear doesn’t prevent death like fear prevents life” -Stefan   That sentence caught me off guard and really is truly inspirational
nHi im Reza From Indonesia, i’ve been following you guys since 2015 and as you know I live in Indonesia thats the biggest country with the islands in the world! I think that I would get is really scared I mean it’s two things im scared of, its about infinite things like flying(SKY) and diving(DEEP SEA) which is that’s the biggest thing there are around my places to live, and I really want to sky diving and freedive into the sea. That’s what my discomfort things.
Holy crap I want to do that so bad. I live in Japan so I don’t think it’s legal to go so high but damnnnn  Cool stuff
I'm from Hong Kong, and my discomfort is climbling K2. Loved the video, so inspiring... felt like i was there with Steffan. Beautiful journey and the views.
I love this video man.. it’s so beautiful, I remember my first time skydiving and it was the best moment of my entire life thus far! As Staffan said the jump made me feel reborn.
Thank you guys for everything you do❤ these videos are what keep me going they help me believe there’s something more for me. Currently living in a very controlling and toxic environment. I’ve been trying to get out of it for 2 years now but with the prices of everything constantly rising it’s not the easiest to leave, especially when college is my main goal in life. So thank you for all of this it allows me to live a little through these videos and helps me escape reality for even just a couple of minutes.
Part of me lives through you guys
Been watching Yes Theory since the beginning, I told myself the next opportunity out of my comfort zone I’m saying yes, I got a job offer as a flight attendant, never being on a plane before in my life I said yes! I plan on leaving North America for the first time in my life this year.
Stefan, you are a amazing human for being scared and doing it anyway 🙌
I want to see a video with people in the back of a mattress coated van... balancing, tug of war, wrestling... while the vehicle is moving in dounuts
The man at 0:56 died attempting a similar flight through a similar mountain. Funny that Yes Theory write “courtesy of…” 😅
Just brilliant well done!!
Such a visceral experience watching that I had to pause the video and breathe just watching on the edge before the jump. Good on you Staffan, being petrified of heights too, that’s the one of the bravest moments I’ve ever seen! Also wow that camera work during the flying part was insane!  I was in the middle of nowhere, taking a break from normal life when when the headspace pack dropped and honestly it was the most perfect timing ever.. not only exactly what I needed right when I needed it, but its helped me make some important decisions about how I want to live life moving forward. I’ll be proudly seeking and facing my fears & discomforts head on and I’ll have Staffan’s wise words in my head when I do after this video now too (and Thomas & Dora’s wisdom from the course too). Thank you so much Yes Theory and Headspace.
I have started the SEEK DISCOMFORT package and I absolutely love it. I am so happy you guys are sending so much positivity and love to so many people that need it. I myself have been using headspace every day for a year now and it has helped me go through my biggest disruptive change in my life!! Lots of love!!! My story will be told one day. Everyday turning my experience into a blessing and hopefully bless others too!!!
It's amazing video really, a lot of emotions. I love you channel guys. Well my story with beating my biggest fear begins with climbing as I afraid of heights, still I'm time to time but the reword of beat it each time I do activities like canyoning, fia ferrata or climb I feel myself released and free. Thanks you for your videos🙏🏻
I was watching this video with tears in my eyes. Real friends care about each other.
nope not even once. not even if you paid me i wouldnt skydive.
Hey guys! Im from Brazil but now live in Germany and skydiving has always been a big dream of mine and i would love to get this opportunity! On the first day of this year i was setting my goals and decided to break then down in 3 categories: physical activity, mental health and seek discomfort. The third theme choice was skydiving, however i didnt knew how expensive it was so now im struggling to find a way to fulfill my dream stil this year, help me out please!!
I’m speechless… gaved me lot of emotions and goosebumps ❤
I am Aastha from United Arab Emirates and I’m going to get a skydiving license!🪂💗🧿
Awesome video, so inspiring and emotional
These are the best episodes! Like a movie
Wait ! You came in Geneva Airport... Working there, couldn't meet you T_T
Hi Yes Theory, I just started with the your Headspace Package, I love it! I'm from Germany and the discomfort I want to conquer, fitting this episode, is to finally do a skydive or bungee jump!!
I am literally crying right now this video is so beautiful
♥
I'm from France and this year I took on the biggest challenge of my life which is to summit Kilimanjaro at 5895m (19,340feet) !  I have never hiked to any mountains/summit higher than 2600m (8530feet) yet and I actually never hiked for more than 3 days in a row !  I am currently training to get my body and mind ready to achieve this dream which, I'm sure, will only be the beginning of a great adventure ! Kilimanjaro is the first step to something bigger I have in mind ;)  Also this video is insane !!! Got goosebumps pretty much the whole time 🤩
This will never ever get seen by anybody but I have to get it out into the world. I had been dating this girl for 4 years, I had known her since we were 9 years old (I’m 21 now) I recently found out that she had been cheating on my for two months and when i told her that I found out she ran away… I didn’t know where she was so I rang the police and they found her after 3 hours of searching. I then found out from her ex best friend that she’s been let out of custody after she threatened to kill her self, I found out that she’s living with the person she has been cheating on me with. To say my heart is crushed is beyond words I just have to say if you ever have any doubts do not put them to the back of your mind and listen to those around you because sometimes you’re blind by the love and you think it’s all rainbows and butterflies but it’s not she lied to my face for two months and I’ll never ever let this go, I’ll remember this for the rest of my life and trust me there’s help out there you just need to ask for it…. Thank you for reading this if anyone does, someone loves you ❤

I have made seek discomfort the motto of my life. I even got “seek discomfort” tattooed on my leg. I always liked the idea of seeking adventures out of your comfort zone. But recently I realized that seeking discomfort is more than doing high adrenaline activities. I just graduated college and I was scared of the uncertain future. I was ready to settle and stay working in retail. But since I’ve been meditating, thanks to inspiration from yes theory, I have reflected and found that I have to seek the discomfort of leaving the job I’ve had for 5 years and take a leap of faith in the career that I want. The other day I accepted a job offer in the field I studied in college a week after graduating. This year, I’m seeking discomfort by taking leaps of faith to be the best version of myself i can be by doing things that I usually keep myself back from doing due to self doubt. I already feel happier and I’m excited to see what more I can achieve
I started the seek plan and honestly can’t wait to start it. I suffer with allot of anxiety and fear over leaving my parents. I’m hoping with this I can learn to over come my fear and anxiety I can’t wait to go on this journey with everyone.
captivating from beginning to end
Y'all need to put that on a Tshirt: "A head full of fears has no space for dreams"  That was beautiful!
“A head full of fears, has no space for dreams.” What a powerful statement wow 🤯
Th description that Staffan gave of how that experience was the scariest thing to ever happen to him, but also one of the most beautiful, is something I want to feel. I am always so impacted one way or another by YesTheory's storytelling, and even though I go out everyday feeling fear, I want to myself to know that I am strong. This month has been the worst I've ever gone through, and I'm proud of myself for staying strong, but my fears still overtake too often. Even with that said, I just have to say how grateful I am to YesTheory for touching not only my life, but so many other's also, and for spreading the best kind of positivity globally. I'm excited to see how this meditation opportunity can change my mindset ! :)
💟
I'm from Puerto Rico and my major discomfort is Fear of Heights. I've been eyeing a skydiving experience to overcome this fear for some time, nonetheless I've always told myself that bungee jumping is the one thing I would never do. Hopefully, I can kick one of the two out of the bucket list for this year.   This video was awesome, "A head full of fears, has no space for dreams" biggest takeaway that's for sure. It's cool to see people choose to feel alive, nice to see you live Staffan🦅🤍
Not going to lie i would have been pissed if they did that to me i know it was from a good place what they where coming from trying to help him but idk if i tell you i dont like somthing dont force me to do it but great video
going to space when ?
They gave poor Staffan a panic attack, but it was endearing seeing how trusting he is of the Yes Team and knowing he’s be okay even though he was terrified
Amazing storytellers, I cried when he jump, I'm a skydiver and his jump reminded me of the fear that I had when I did my AFF course (to become skydiver). Thank you guys!
Just started the Seek Discomfort package, y'all have helped me get out of my shell more and become a better person and it's amazing to see y'all touch the hearts of people across the world
I am also like Steffan. Terrified of hights, but yet i have bungee jumped solo and into the new year tied to my closest friend. Solo may have taken over 45min but i did it... Watching this gave me butterflies as i no one day ill have to face my biggest fear.
i'm jealous. i really want to do that. scuba and freedive is the closest i'll ever get to flying.
The camera man is not getting enough credit, they are doing barrel rolls 6k feet high lmao
A beautiful video with a beautiful message 🫶🏼🫶🏼 thank you guys for this masterpiece. I am from Mexico and I would love to go skydiving with you guys 😊
Already started my first section of the seek discomfort headspace pack. Found Headspace from them and have been using it for over a year now. So happy they made this pack.
Would love for you to visit the Cerro Gordo. It's a mining town that has been active since before LA became a metropolis. The surrounding area have been the reason that Los Angeles became as big as it is and the current owner has his own YouTube channel called GhostTownLiving, doing all sorts of videos about exploring the mines. You spending a day at the place behind LA would be great!
WOW! Crazy experience! Lets gooo Staffan!!
I am Dennis. From Kenya. Amazing stuff right there. Skydiving has always been at the top of my bucket list. IDK if I'll ever get the chance to do it but it's always nice seeing you guys do it, always challenging yourselves. Putting yourselves at the edge and facing your fears. Hopefully one day I will get the chance to face mine
Hey everyone and hey to Yes Theory. Can’t say I’ve had a crazy life or an interesting life, but watching your videos has shown me that it’s okay to do things differently. I’m still on a journey to become the best me I can be. For my 25th birthday I wanted to sky dive in Houston, to try to overcome my doubts and show to myself that anything is possible. Unfortunately that did not happen and I don’t know when I will go skydiving, but I’m reaching out because I want to conquer my fears within myself. Thank you for all the videos y’all make to help people like me and others!
My first skydive.....18k ft.....highest in US supposedly.  Space coast....near Kennedy Space Center...FLORIDA
This brought me to tears really, because I could see myself in Stefan exactly. This is by far my biggest fear I could ever overcome and I have yet to sky dive but I know one day I will do it as petrified as I am. Yes Theory has given me the ability to say I will do something and mean it. I feel so capable of anything when I know fear isn’t a barrier anymore
WOW!! So much respect for Staffan for facing his fear. The support and love you guys have for each other brought me to tears. It's amazing to watch ♥
Crying tears of joy, pride and inspiration. You guys are doing it, living it. You continue to be such a source of pure positive energy in this world. Thank you all, so grateful. ✨
This video was truely amazing, the camera work, editing, story telling, everything. The emotions could be felt through the screen, you bet I was crying.   Your collaboration with headspace comes at the perfect time, since I used to meditate everyday but fell out of it and had a hard time getting back to it.   This year, my discomfort will be quitting university and accepting an amazing full-time job at a Dutch start-up where I combine creativity and science, to inspire people to live healthy. I'm moving to a new city where I don't know anyone, but I am beyond excited.
this was an amazing journey to witness.
I’m from Slovenia and I’m seeking too rebuild myself after trauma and suicide of a friend, to trust and love myself and get my panic-attacks in control.
Steffan, I don't know you but I am so fucking proud of you! Wtf ! You did it 🎉 WOOOO WOOOO   So inspiring guys. Love your channel ! Thanks for all this content.
Mannn i just can't control my tears 🥲 like such a great way of executing things only can be done by yestheory
I love YesTheory!! ❤
Hi guys! My name is Pablo, I'm from Mexico City.  This is my second week in the quest to know my spiritual and personal development side.  So one of my main goals is to control my fears and I will do that by going through multiple experiences where discomfort will be the main part of them.  I send you love for your effort and for posting these videos. It's inspiring to see someone just like me accomplish these kinds of things. ❤  (I really mean it, my deepest fear is jump from a plane) 😅
this feels like impractical jokers now LMFAO
Im from Germany, but currently I’m in Australia to seek the discomfort of travelling alone in a foreign country.
I’m from Arizona, I’d promise my dad We would sky dive together but over the years I’ve gotten a fear of heights. Not sure why. Never got to make it with my dad as he passed 2 years ago. One day I’ll make it, for him. I’ll seek discomfort
I AM FROM GUATEMALA (LIVING IN SWEDEN) AND THE DISCOMFORT I AM SEEKING THIS YEAR IS TO: SCUBA DIVE WITH SHARKS!
When it comes to heights it’s the same life you’ve had but just from a different perspective. Being around helicopters has really changed how I look at aviation and free falling.
You should try Everest sky dive. You can see all the mountain ranges.
Hi!!! I’m a teacher in Illinois and while skydiving is something i’m terrified of, I’d love the chance to do it and with Yes Theory, it would be amazing!
This is kinda messed up
so inspiring
Can I just say.. I am SO happy that Staffan is a part of the Yes Theory crew. Who knew that this random guy you all met during the making of a past video would be such an amazing, wholesome, and inspirational person! This video had me in tears, as it really resonated with me personally and I think it’s time I start facing some of my own fears 💪
Imagine they got Cage to skydive with them 😂 that would have been awesome
Im from Australia and want to overcome my irrational fear of sharks. Amazing to watch Staffan transfer fear into a positive emotion <3
This was so heartwarming and inspirational. The fact that "a head full of fears has no space for dreams" was the ending quote truly pushes me / goes to show that in order to conquer your fears you almost have to unlearn perspectives and scripts in your head and rewrite your story. I have always wanted to use meditation as a way to guide myself to that so I will most definitely use the code to use the free trial and check out Thomas's collection!  When people ask where I'm from, it's difficult for me to say - but in saying that I grew up in London, Hong Kong, and am now living in Canada - and I think that's where my fear stems from - this social anxiety to find friends in new cities with deep, meaningful connections. I stepped out of my comfort zone last summer when I went backpacking (even got the lightning bolt tattooed :O) but yet still find myself with this fear (especially when I'm in a room and don't know ANYONE). Will be a journey to conquer, but I'm sure a skydive will do the trick ;)
I almost feel like thomas is loving doing these borderline mean things.. steffan came and just gave them a new video model “making steffan do this thing we dont wanna do” 😅 not like they didnt earn it tho
I'm from the USA and my discomfort is going on a solo trip to another country. I've always had anxiety about small everyday things and I feel it would push me to feel more confidence in my ability to navigate change. This year on my husbands birthday, I surprised him by skydiving for the very first time while he was a student skydiver. I'll always remember him saying how proud he was of me for pushing myself and overcoming my anxiety! The feeling is indescribable, and I always go back to that moment at the edge of the open plane to push me to seek discomfort in new or scary situations! Thank you guys for what you do, so many people need this kind of encouragement to push themselves to achieve their dreams ♡
ahh so good!! just started the seek discomfort package, thanks so much for these resources! I'm from Scotland and my biggest discomfort would probably be scuba diving, closely followed by caving/spelunking  lots of love :)
i am crying. this episode hit me. heights are the worst. he should be sooo proud
This video is crazy man, its so beautiful filled with lot of emotions.loved it
listening to Thomas and Dora in headspace right now ❤❤❤❤ about to go summit my fear of driving alone
You guys should do wheelchair rugby! Murderball! Representation of Paralympic sports would be awesome.
Staffan you are a GOAT!
Staffan you had me tears! You were the bravest eagle brother!
You guys have truly been so inspiring to me!! Coming at you from CANADA! Soon to be making some big life changes and figuring out what is next for my life - so I used the code and downloaded Headspace! I'm sure this will help a lot!  And thanks for all that you guys are doing and your way of capturing and sharing stories from people around the world! Hoping to be a part of that in my own way! ❤️
These guys are incredible! So motivating genuinely
I'm from the US and I'm training to climb one of the highest mountains in the lower 48. this is my second attempt as horrible weather forced us off the mountain.
Your inability to hold a steady camera shot is nausea inducing.  Like I can't even look at the screen half the time, your killing me
Day 495. Waiting for YES THEORY to fulfill my wish. From the Philippines.🇵🇭
Mmm, I’ll bet Thomas has a sweet hole 😍❤
“So we’re not seeing Nicholas cage?” 😭😂
😮😮😮😮😮
So inspiring to see Steffan push through his fear so gracefully. Now I’m trying to get out of my comfort zone and try something new (maybe even skydiving!)   I’m loving finally having Headspace for these 60 days 🫶 the series is amazing!!
So Proud Of Staffan!
I'm from Slovakia/Canada and always looking to seek new adventures, meet new people and experience discomfort. After going to the Ukraine border to volunteer/help donate supplies and recently visiting Lviv - Ukraine it really opened up my eyes what real struggles are. I have spoken with many people and many of them have only experienced only negative discomfort through out their life....like the war.   This video, combined with my past experiences have really showed me what life is about and that we need to live it to the fullest every single day. Through good and bad, because we never know when its our last. My goal for this year would be exactly the same as this video. To go sky diving over the swiss alps It has always been a dream of mine and would be awesome if it came true.
This episode moved me in surprising ways. I've loved all the Yes Theory videos and this one (and especially Staffan's mindset and willingness to push through the fear!) has become a favorite that sits on the "top shelf" for me. 💜 Just started the Seek Discomfort collection on headspace and am loving the reflection prompts as a way for me to create space in my day to actually reflect (not just know that it's important to reflect 😅).
Ughh I love you guys lol best homies ever...
I love his statement for FEAR:  Face Everything And Rise.   Also for FEAR:  False Evidence Appears Real.   And LOVE:  Life Of Vast Eternity ❤
Amazing video😄
Insane! My fear of heights is also one of my biggest fears.... and I think my response if somebody told me to do this would have just been "no" and I would have walked away.... biggest respect to you Staffan for doing this! I am so amazed!
Amazing shots, editing and storytelling.  Yes Theory to the moon
Love from pakistan ❤️
I've wanted to skydive for so long and I'm finally going for the first time this Summer by myself because no one I know would go with me 🤣. After experiencing free-fall for even just 2 seconds, I am absolutely terrified to jump out of the plane. But I know that once I do, the experience is going to be incredible. This video was great timing for me, even though seeing Staffan so scared reinforced my fear, but I'm going to do it anyway and check this experience off my bucket list!
Hey<3 I'm from Finland and my discomfort is to seek help for my mental health and shed the layers that keep me trapped.
I was born in Thailand, I'm from the US and I grew up in Taiwan and my discomfort is moving to the Phillipines
Amazing men! Thanks for the repeat of positive impressions of meditation, almost signed up the last 2 promo codes but I’m in finally signed up this time!! Love y’all!!! I want to seek discomfort by finding out who I am. I’ve lived my life serving others or just surviving
His frase "FEAR: Face Anithing And Rise" shuld be a tishirt
A heart rate monitor would've been amazing 😂
"Fear doesn't prevent death like fear prevents life, so I'm stopping myself from living and I just want to - break - this barrier and feel more alive than I have ever felt before" and then I started crying because Staffan made me realize how afraid I am of dying and how that fear has been stopping me from skydiving or scuba diving or anything remotely thrilling because my fear of death has held me back. Thank you Staffan for changing my perspective on that, it's time to stop stopping myself from living <3
Hi im from argentina and is one of my biggest dreams to skydive!!! I went to a brain surgery last year, had a tumor near my right ear and the recovery went very good given the circumstances, lost only the hearing from my right side. The biggest thing to go trought was the time in the hospital were i felt trapped, and the couple months that came afterwards were i had to patienly gain force again to eat or walk again. Now is all passed and im myself again almost completly but i ask me constanly why this happened, what this tumor came to teach me? it drives me crazy just to think that it had no reason at all and i couldn´t learn anything from it. Just heal and go on with my life? it can´t be.  This maybe sounds like im pitying myself for a good story. Really idk why i wrote all this here but every thing i ask myself and write about this helps me understand a bit more about my process. I think what bothers me more is that before the tumor i wanted something to striked me hard and tell me what to do in life, and that thing came and it wasn´t so easy, im still struggling with my future, still struggling to find what i have to do in this world. I wanna leave a mark but the strenght still has to come from inside. The video was awesome as usual and at the half of it i use the code and wrote the comment but now i edited it because i ended it in tears didn´t know why and i had clearly more to say... love u.
I would totally do this
Staffan screaming from the parachute is so funny lol. That was awesome!
What a beautiful story! And a phrase that Stephen said moments before he jumped, sticked with me.  I have started your package, going to try it during this week, really inspired  I am from Russia, left it 8 month ago. Now I am in Israel and going to Georgia in a month. So, pick any of these) Except for Russia, I suppose
this is amazing, i am so inspired by what you guys do! i am even more inspired to travel to new places and save up to connect my dad back to his home country, Guyana. Keep up the videos!
Such an epic video! Amazing as always, Staffan you BEAST! Well done bro!  I have entered the competition btw <3
you guys were in switzerland?in my country?only about 2 hours away from me?🙈😅wow i am proud of staffan i would have run away as fast as i can and shit my pants.😂😂Staffan you are an inspiration💪💪💪
Hi, I m from South Africa and my discomfort is talking to strangers.
This brought a face full of tears to me, from where, I do not know. I'm 75, and have an experience level far below where it should be by now. As I have been dead inside over 30 years. I have tried to stay with Yes Theory since I found you years ago to help me feel as if I'm alive. Thank you. Can Identify with this gentleman.💜🙏🌹        😎👍
I've been lucky enough to skydive one, I could feel these wonderful sensations one more time through you guys! After that dive, I promised miself I'll be able to jump alone one day, this video is the trigger I've been waiting for!
Video starts at 17:40. Thank me later
I will show this vedio to my kids when I am old
I'm from Switzerland and want to skydive!!
Guys I love your channel and challenges so much! Thank you so much for all the inspiration. I‘m from Germany and right now I‘m facing the fear of letting my ex finally go and going out to enjoy my life to its fullest again. A skydive would probably blow out all the thoughts in my head. 😌🙏
Too bad I can’t be a part of the 3 winners since I already pay for headspace so I can’t use the code 😂
Why do i always tend to tear up at the end of every video of you guys 🥹 Keep going and I myself will seek discomfort some day surely ❤
what an insane story / feeling =) looove it
imagine badly needing to take a piss or shit in the middle of a skydive
This gave me goosebumps and all the feels! Powerful! So true a head full of fears leaves no space for dreams 💛
can wing suit skydiving be used for military purposes?
What an amazing experience.
i would KILL them if they'd do this to me, not cool
I'm waiting for the Yes Theory Jeff Wittek skydive crossover episode!
So inspiring 😊 I started the headspace journey! Thank you Thomas ❤
hi guys love your videos I'm new to the channel I'm seeking discomfort anywhere Trinidad and Tobago
Wow! ...simply wow... I love every single part of this... I had such a journey with you through this video! I did not expect to end up coming to tears with how powerful it was! Cinematicly, visually, emotionally, just wow 👏   I have been going through soo much in my life lately that the emotions poured out of me as this story unfolded. I am terrified of skydiving... but always though that maybe one day a wing suit flight would be incredible! My dreams of flight have been with me since I was a child!  Thank you so much for sharing this video!!! I'd love to meet you guys one day!! Much love! ❤  -John Ohio USA
Yes Theory continues to inspire all of us to not be scared and just says YES !!!
I am crying so much right now. Good job Staffan that was very inspiring. I wish to do that too one day. Love from Cyprus <3
Can we take a moment to appreciate the camera work that went into this. Most amazing footage so high in the sky!
Last famous words from Staffan: So we are not meeting Nicolas Cage?
Didn't wanted this video to ever end 🥹 What a master piece ♥️♥️♥️
I don't know whether that panic attack he had before flying , is real or not, but if it's real I don't think this is a good way of overcoming fears. Because if someone who's having specific phobia should not expose to the triggering agent suddenly. He or she could have die with a panic attack. I have seen all of your videos and I appreciate ur work. Just worried about you guys.
You guys are the coolest people on the planet. Thank you
Yes Staffan!!! 🎉 y’all are so inspiring  Love the new spot on headspace. I’ve been a member for about a year now because of one of y’all’s 60 day free trials. And I’ve passed it forward to others i know and they’re loving the app too. I’m so stoked for y’all’s contribution to the meditations available. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 much love fam
I'm from the United States (Michigan) and I am currently pursuing a career change. It's a bit uncomfortable for me because I went to University for Engineering but after working for a little over a year I am starting to realize that Engineering might not be the best career choice for me. I have decided to pursue Project Management which has been something I have always had a natural ability for.
I cried so much watching this video, I have such a huge fear of heights and have never been on a plane because of it. I always say “one day I want to be able to travel when I’m brave enough”. I went through all the emotions with Steffan, I felt the fear for him and with him, I kept thinking that I could never do that but him jumping out with only a few hours notice made me realize that I am brave enough. I’ve always been brave enough. I would love to take that leap with you guys and face a fear that didn’t feel possible for me!  I am starting that head space journey with you guys as well. You are truly changing lives.  I do not want to live with the regret of not leaving any space for my dreams and I am determined not to.
I AM FROM FRANCE AND I WANT TO OVERCOME MY FEAR OF HEIGHTS, MORE SPECIFICALLY STRONG SENSATIONS LIKE SKYDIVING
This was by far the most emotional yesTheory video for me.. amazing and BRAVO Staffan! I really recognized myself in the fear of Staffan, how he described it, and how it is hard to overcome it, as it is my biggest fear too. This gives me hope that one day, ONE DAY, I will also skydive... Thank you YesTheory
for perhaps just a moment, the world was upside down ONLY for you stefan. beutifull ride
This is  what LIFE feels like!!
What an amazing experience. Good job guys 👍🏻❤️
Wow this is amazing. I wish someday i would have the chance to do something like this or even just normal skydive ! Great video and awesome editing job keep up the good work and let's keep the adventure crazy. All those thing you guys do just makes me dream ❤
You guys fill me with serotonin while watching these videos 😇
that 19:20 makes me stop, and cried. Skydive has and always been one of my dream. I can feel the story of how he overcomes the fear. Much love, Yes Theory. My highest respect to the editor!
I truly love this channel and have been following it for years. However, I am unsubscribing today because I can no longer support the frequent flying for leisure/professional reasons. You are based in Europe and there are SO many adventures and amazing places awaiting you that are accessible by car/bus/train. The message you are sharing is beautiful, and you show the beauty of the Earth in some of your videos, thank you for that. But as we are deep in the environmental crisis, please consider being more eco-friendly by at least reducing the flying from one country to another etc... Entertainment should help people, not hurt the planet.
that was fast
guys, after this beaaaautiful friendship voucher you just gave Staffan I belive he should Demand to meet Nicholas Cage now xP
The amount of emotions you were able to capture and show to the audience is enormous.
Wow! You are so brave Staffan.
This vid made me tear up was so moving 🥹
Loved every SINGLE moment!
I did a 20000 ft skydive recently! Moved abroad from the Netherlands to the other side of the world 4 years ago to Australia and now living in Auckland, New Zealand and Yes Theory (especially Ammar) inspired me to take the crazy leap and its totally true! I was super afraid of heights, but the life greatest experiences will happen to conquer your discomfort and it makes you feel so free to do the things you thought you will never achieve. I just signed up for the Auckland marathon in October and ready to conquer this new challenge! Change your life and just sign up for that highest skydive or bungee, FEEL THE FEAR BUT DO IT ANYWAYS! It will be so scary but you won't be disappointed!
Beautiful.  You will never look at the sky the same.  Welcome…….
What would I give to do something like this, this is a dream come true!
Norway
Wouldn't it be nice if Nick Cage suddenly appeared at the end and said, "Good job, eagle."
I have the same fear but maybe one day I would love to try it
I’m from New Jersey here in the good old United States. I the discomfort that I am seeking out this year is living away from home. I am in college and have gotten an apartment with a few guys. I’m scared and nervous to live away from my family because I overthink almost everything. I constantly have panic attacks thinking about if I need something urgent, my family won’t be there to help me. I’ve watched you guys for a couple of years now and I love the message love over fear and the idea of trying to look for something that is uncomfortable because they end up being the best experiences. If I go into this next year with that mindset, I think it will help me out tremendously. Thank you guys!
You people are awesome. Always inspiring.❤
Their friendship is amazing. This is the kind of community we want to surround ourselves with. People who motivate us to conquer our fears.
ngl, i could easily live without making this experience. getting out of ur comfort zone is good and all, but i dont need to be underneath water or up in the air to do that haha even just looking at the camera footage of the hight and this confined cockpit is uncomfortable
If I were to be able to sky dive with you guys especially this year it would be one of the biggest dreams come true I’ve watched you guys since 2018 I think and you’ve inspired me more then you could know your message Is one the most beautiful I’ve ever heard and try to live by it every day
Wow. Guys it was an amazing episode. You guys are exceptional 🙌
Hope Im able to do this before 30
Such a beautifully told story. I felt the fear, and just reacted so much to Staffan facing that. What a great video. 😁🦅🪂
Fear Everything And Rise
I truly cried watching him in the air. Something about him doing something he thought he would never do just hit me. YOU DID IT MAN!!
LETS GOOOOOOOO! Staffan I am super proud of you for facing your fear head on when presented with the opportunity to.  Way to go man!
Hi. My name is is Niki and I am from Ontario, Canada. I’ve started your package which comes at an amazing time in my life. I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and minor OCD over 15 years ago. I put in the time then, to make it manageable but it’s still something I have to contend with everyday… and be mindful… and choose to push myself . Anxiety is my discomfort that I’ve decided I will battle once and for all…. Put in the effort and change my life for good. I’m done just “managing”, I don’t want to live with it anymore.
Emotional!!!! So proud of you/happy for you, Steffan. Loved this from the concept to the production. Goosebumps, teared up and laughed with joy when you jumped and flew. Inspiring and never at a bad time. So many mantras to take away. Thank you for sharing with us, team!
I AM FAN FROM UGANDA. Just subscribed to the headspace through the link. My ultimate dream for the last 12years has been to skydive. Please make it happen. SAY YES to me. Much love. Oh my life mantra is “Live the dash” got it off a video on the channel where it explained the time we have on this planet being summed up to the dash between the D.O.B - D.O.D on one’s tombstone.
Hi my name is Achraf and i'm from morocco but residing in poland, my biggest discomfort would be fear of heights and i would love to experience what it feels like.
Beautiful!
Hey guys! I have started the seek discomfort package on headspace. Greetings from Portugal!
Hey Therme im Form Germany and my discomfort is im afraid of Hights
I don’t know how you did it but it felt like I was there with you flying & feeling all those roller coaster of feelings. One of the best videos
I could not stop crying - what an INSPIRATION STEFFAN. You make me want to be braver human THANKYOU x
YOUR BIGGEST KENYAN FAN RIGHT HERE, 23/05/2023
My name is raunit, I am from India and my biggest discomfort this year is leaving my life and family behind and moving to a different country (Sweden)
Love you guys, "A head full of fear has no space for dreams" - this line will motivate me always. Thanks "Yes Theory" for making this film
They’ve have changed this man’s life forever, what a gift 🤍 I have spent the last few years training myself (on a small scale) to get comfortable with discomfort and this stuff is truly what makes you feel alive. It brings you out of the darkness. I’m in Australia and I would love to do the base camp trek in Everest one day so that I can be at one with the universe as it is. I love this channel!
Wondering if there will be new podcasts episodes
This was a masterpiece good job
I loved when Staffan said: A head full of fears has no space for dreams.  Good for you on saying YES to the challenge, Staffan!🎉
I am from Romania and my discomfort is studying for the 12th grade exam! :(
SO beautiful to watch Steffan grow and develop with you guys!! He seems like such a genuine and kind person, happy he's a part of Yes Theory 😄  Also, so thankful you guys are doing another Headspace give away. I've been waiting for one for so long!! And it's come at the perfect time in my journey as well. So much love for this channel. Best creators on Youtube hands down. ❤
Love your videos!!! Made me tear up with this one. So amazing to see. Ive been talking to my overseas partner for 4 years and over that time you guys have showed me the wonderful things in this world and inspired me to soon hopefully go overseas for the first time🥰🥰 thankyou for everything you guys do❤
Wow, watching this video was an absolute rollercoaster of emotions. I could really feel Staffans excitement through my screen. Skydiving is definetly one of the top things i want to experience in my life. My biggest Discomfort this year will be going to Peru for a year withought speaking Spanish. I‘m terrified but also really excitet to get to know there culture and especially there food. You guys definetly helped me doing this decision and stepping out of my comfort zone. Thank you so much. Love from Germany.
Absolutely wonderful! ❤
cried like a baby, it’s so beautiful to see the special friendship you guys have 😢
Im from England and a discomfort that I am overcoming this year is my fear of being alone. I am flying alone for the first time this year! the meditations on headspace will definitely help
Amazing drop!!! Reminds me of early yes theory. Love it everything you guys do
What an astounding experience guys. Over the past years, you guys have grown and grown and keep on growing. It's actually insane, and I'm so proud of all of you. You are slowly making this world a better place, if you haven't noticed yet.  I just purchased Headspace, and I'm very excited to start on my mission of getting better at coping with my stress, anxiety, and most of all all of the thoughts in my head that keep me from doing what I want to a lot of times in my daily life. I find it really hard to concentrate, and therefore am grateful to start on this Headspace journey. Skydiving is a dream for me, which I've sadly never had the chance to accomplish yet. I'm from the Netherlands 🇳🇱 but one of my biggest dreams is skydiving above the Great Blue Hole in Belize. It's a country that is not much known of, besides that can be quite dangerous. I've never been outside of Europe before, but it looks so beautiful to me. I would never dare to go there alone, but if you guys are up for a challenge... 😏
THIS IS AMAZING. SO SO AMAZING!
that was absolutely incredible. the bravery and the ability to push past fear and the bliss he felt afterwards just shows how important it is to seek discomfort
Man yes theory is OP
You guys have created so many incredible videos throughout the years, but I don't think I've ever been moved as much as watching this one. Especially having just finished the first part of the Seek Discomfort package on Headspace and after jumping straight into the abyss of realising what discomfort is to me. It feels so unreal how big of a change to ones mentality you can make showing how much goes into fighting your fears and how much you get out of it. I'm so proud of you for constantly overcoming your fears and for creating such an amazing tool with headspace!
My new favourite video 😍 The most little things can give me discomfort so I can't even imagine doing that. Hopefully headspace will help with just everyday life. Love from Hungary 🤍
You guys got me sitting here crying like a three year old
11:47  fear doesn't prevent death, fear prevents live. PUT THAT ON A TSHIRT!
Inspiring as always. I am from Australia and seeking discomfort in leaving my 6 figure salary, selling my house and moving to the USA to pursue a dream of flying for an airline. At 32 years old this is life changing, so far out of my comfort zone 😅   Thanks for the Headspace link, I’ve downloaded the app and used your code. I hope this will help with the stress of this big change in my life 🤞🏽
This...I am speechles. This video made me full of emotions. I had feeling that I am there with you all❤Also, thank you for the code for headspace, I activated the "seek discomfort" package and I am eager to use it! 😊
Damn, that last quote hit me. Im the most spontaneous crazy thrill seeker but when it comes to LIFE decisions, i over think so much of failing and always prevent myself from taking that first time.
Be open to challenges and be ready to face everything that the world throws at you. As a lover of everything that gives me reasons to keep going skydiving was always in my list and now even more !!
Let's go Stefan. Amazing friends. I wish somebody would surprise me like that. Love you Yes Theory
So happy for you Staffan 💪
Hi Yes Theory, I've been your fan since 2016. I'm from the Philippines and my discomfort is going in high places, I love to do skydiving but I am also afraid of doing it. Thank you I am hoping you'll choose me
🦅
I'm from Canada, my discomfort is deep water. Like ocean deep water. Since I can remember, I've always been so fascinated by the ocean; the sea creatures, the reefs, the vastness and mystery of it. Growing up as a kid my goal was to become a deep sea marine biologist, to go where very few people ever go. Yet funny enough, even though I wanted to study the ocean, at same time i was terrified of ocean. I was always afraid to swim in it, due to it's dark depth and how uncertain the water and waves could be. And to this day, I've never swam in the ocean, something I'm really hoping to change this year.
I’m not crying you are
Please, don't kill Staffan, we all love him  P. S.: You are the greatest creators and people to make your audience feel such strong emotions that they will chase these feelings in their lives!
I really needed this video right now. It is amazing, and gives me hope for the future and for what I am pushing through and striving for. As always, you all are an inspiration.
Is it technically a free fall with wing suit on? Isn’t it more like gliding? Just curious
A head full of fears has no place for dreams. Thank you Yes Theory for the best inspiration and the best videos of my life.
F*^#ing send it!
Falling in style 🔥🔥
that was the cutest and most wholesome thing ever. i’m going through a hard time and that cheered me up
Wow! Seriously inspiring 💖
am i the only person here that starts to get tears of joy in my eyes when watching this channel?  i get so excited
everyones looking at Staffan and cheering him on in his main character moment and same with all the other videos but for every one of these insane videos the camera man is right along side all the action, and still getting great shots.
There's not much air at 20000'. You will get some and it will happen quickly At 16000' there's still nothing much breathable....but its not all that original. My first dive was sixteen thousand feet I still had some oxygen and it doesn't take long.. To get to the point where there is. I'm going to call Uncle BS.
that was such a beautiful video to watch. there is so much to learn through this. wow just wow.
you guys deserve 100 million view every video
you guys have different experiences and stories to share, I suggest you guys do a podcast together or each week with different members.
That “fear doesn’t prevent death, it prevents life.” Comment, whhhheeew. 😅
i’ve started it and couldn’t be happier with the first day results😊 thanks for the inspiring vids guys
Wow… This was incredibly moving. Beautiful ❤️
Anyone know the song at 11:46??? I’ve been searching forever and can’t find it
I've never skydived and can only imagine the pure anxiety that Steffan had to battle in order to go through with this insane and inspiring experience. I'm a composer, and spend the vast majority of my time indoors and writing music on a computer. Videos like this remind me that life is infinitely beautiful and rewarding to those who venture out and free their minds from the habits and anxieties that plague our existence in the modern world. Thank you Yes Theory for this eye-opening view of the possibilities!! And thanks for my 60 days of free Headspace :)
“Fear doesn’t prevent death, fear prevents life” wow that’s a truth
❤ skydive ❤
I'm happy for you Stefan <3
Insane😅
Craziest episode ever❤❤
You guys really know how to hit us right in the heart. What a beautiful experience to capture I feel so lucky that we get to see this
Just started the Seek Discomfort package! I've always been terrified by the feeling of falling but the experiance of seeing the earth like that is something I really want to overcome this fear for (unfortunatly there is the additional roadblock of the price). When I was young even ziplines were too scary but watching these videos where Thomas and Stephen face their fears has been so chalenging and encouraging that I'm willing to try to face mine!
I'd love to skydive but already have Headspace downloaded! Love listening to Thomas' collection ❤️
Another banger you did it Staffan. So proud woww amazed
I would love to do that. Going to do my skydive license soon and than in a couple of years try wingsuiting😍😍😍
I’m Ayden I want to skydiving
Cool but I am not buying that that dude didn't know in advance about the stunt.
I'm so glad Staffan loved it in the end! We're all so proud of him! I had so much anxiety for him because as someone who isn't even afraid of heights and always wanted to skydive... I HATED it 🤣  I'm glad that wasn't his experience lol
Such a beautiful video Staffan is such a wonderful addition to the team and this video was just the true symbolism of the yes theory message and beauty of saying yes. Love you guys so much!! 🦅🤍
That was amazing!!!!! I went on my first tandem jump last October, it was insane!!! I can't imagine 20,000ft though, good job!!!
Whenever you feel scared of doing something in your life and have fear, come back to this video and watch it. This is a human who was terrified and conquered fear.
This has now become one of my favorite Yes Theory videos. I felt every single emotion Staffan experienced throughout the hours. I am afraid of heights too, my hands begin to sweat as soon as I even watch a video that has something to do with heights. My stomach curled up and I felt anxious when Staffan was about to go. It's like I was there myself. I love y'all so much. Every video has me in tears and this community ignites so much inspiration and happiness in me. We're all so proud of you, Staffan!!! FEAR = FACE EVERYTHING AND RISE. 💙🫶🏻 For whoever sees this, reply with a fear you want to conquer in the next year, and come back when you have met your goal!! Love to all❤️
Mans was gagging
Hi guys! What a great video. I couldn’t stop smiling during the free fall 😂. They say that if you dream of something it’s because it is meant for you, and I like to think that is true. I’d love to skydive with you! Greetings from Mexico 🇲🇽
You guys are the best!! It was my dream to try skydiving, it seems like when you jump on the plane, it would be the moment I'll feel I'M ALIVE. Thankyou for sharing your experience to the WORLD.
"Keep presence to your emotions" love it 😍 Amazing Skydive and great video!
I´m from Mexico 🦅🌵 and this year I´m looking forward to climbing El Nuevado de Toluca(Mountain) and skydiving for the first time ever IN MY LIFE on my BIRTHDAY 🎂😅
Powerful cameraman
Omöjligt att inte älska kanalen, omöjligt att inte älska staffan. Lets gooooo!
This my dream! One day, I will do it!
Definitely a Staffan fan. Love his addition to Yes Theory.
"fear doesn't prevent death like fear prevents life"
There is no growth in the comfort zone.  I’m 37 FM who battled a long drug and alcohol addiction, a very rough life growing up, I was to a point of absolute defeat, I’ve lost both of my parents in the past 5 years.. I’ve climbed out of that mindset of give up and into the mindset of GET UP,  I’m no longer battling addiction, I’m stable and have an amazing career, I’m not homeless anymore  And I’ve lost 60 pounds in a year!   For some people, Discomfort may be some challenges that are crazy like jumping out of a helicopter  For other people, like me; discomfort may be facing the challenges in life to get them back on track like debt management, addiction and people skills.   Your videos are wonderful! I get some motivation every time I watch! I love your genuine spirits.   Ever thought about adding life recovery to the mix?
I love Steffan his vibe his energy I just love it and that he’s willing to seek discomfort❤️
For some reason that brought tears to my eyes and I don't know why. Good for you though! What an experience!!
I’M FROM ATLANTA, UNITED STATES, AND MY NO. 1 DISCOMFORT IS HEIGHTS! To me, facing a fear once just doesn’t cut it. My goal this year is to face my fears and sign myself to be Skydive Certified, so I complete 30 jumps in a month 💪🏼 Winning this giveaway would be the BEST start to my mission!! Hook me up guys!
From sweden going backpacking solo in europe this summer
This might be the best Yes Theory video yet!
this morning i decided to head out for my first ever solo hike! as i ate my breakfast, kind of hoping i’d get a response from at least one of my friends being willing to join me, i saw your post about this video and your collab with headspace. within seconds my worries and fears were washed away. i watched this video before i set off on my hike by myself, and used to meditations to listen to at the peak of the mountain. thank you guys for always encourage courage and facing anything that makes you fearful. i can confidently say i’m proud of myself and am looking forward to so many more solo hikes for the rest of my life !!!
9:29 Hi, I’m from Mexico. Two years ago my dad died and it’s been really tough for me. Since his passing, I haven’t had the time to do all the things I want because of fear, which is really ironic because I believe we need to live the moment to the fullest. This year I’m seeking discomfort by moving to a totally different continent and study there my passion (Culinary Arts). I’ve worked really hard to get a scholarship and I got it! Now I’m going to go and live my dream and study in Switzerland.  Thank you guys, I love your video!!
"Fear doesn't prevent death like fear prevents life" -Staffan   That's deep
As someone who is sitting here. In pain. After I broke my lower spine. And been told maybe it’s time to quit. Or thinking I will quit things that seem fearful. This has only inspired me. Not only to look forward to the future but to break future fears. Keep moving forward with my dreams and breaking down the barriers. So proud of you! I teared up at the end. More reason for me to heal. So I can live and enjoy life. And somehow this has made my pain seem less painful. There’s a future of conquering so much. We only have one life and we have to live it to the fullest. And fear will only prevent us from living life to the fullest. In so many different aspects of life. So much love to you all!
Today's experience doesn't look anything like yours. Mine was only 150 foot free fall drop set up. I've always wanted to but was too afraid to and allowed that crippling fear orevent me from trying. I did it because I heard all of the affirmations and all of the commentary over so many of your guys episodes in my head. Thank you for the yes theory, thank you for helping others be brave. I can't imagine what I'll journey to try now, but I'm so excited to tackle another fear. Today, I stopped fear from preventing me to live and I have one of the most memorable experiences of my life now. Thank you 😊
Way to go Stefan, absolutely brilliant 👏👏A massive challenge for you but you took it like a champ! Well done❤
spell check! you spelled pathological wrong
>face to face with ur fear >"a head full of fears has no space for dreams" >tackle ur fear >anime scene
I would pass out…..
Hiii! I’m in recovery. Almost 2 years sober. (July 19th!) last august I took the leap and decided to try skydiving. After being like Stefan about heights my fear was almost crippling. Well I decided to try it, I found a whole new type of love for trying things that scare me!! I am hoping this summer to start surfing. Another fear (much smaller than skydiving though) and my big fear/bucket goal is to swim with sharks!! I love everything to do with the ocean. Thank you for posting amazing content and keeping people like me seeking discomfort in life to keep me motivated to stay strong and push through all types of fears!!
A head full of fear has no space for dreams
I really hope this is somewhat fake and they didn’t pressure him into this. I get the channel but this is a bit messed up and makes for a negative work environment. It’s more of a prank than seeking discomfort
flying vs gliding. I know this is semantics, but words matter.
3 of my favorite quotes now "Fear keeps you from living more than it keeps you from dying" "A head full of fears leaves no room for dreams" "You cant fly like an eagle if you surround yourself with turkeys"

THE 3 PEOPLE WHO WILL BE SELECTED I WISH YOU TO FLY FREELY FOR ALL OF US MANKIND. MUCH LOVE FROM CANADA. GOD BLESS YOU AND MAY ALL YOUR FEARS DISAPPEAR! I AM PROUD OF YOU STAFFAN AND THE ENTIRE YES THEORY FAMILY! I HOPE TO ONE DAY EXPERIENCE SUCH A BEAUTIFUL AND PEACEFUL MOMENT IN MY LIFE.
Hi I started your 60 headspace free trial. I love your videos and have always dreamed of flying, hope I get to go with you guys. Love from Canada ❤
What a beautiful video!! Incredible  shots, beautiful scenery and such a profound message. Steffan is so insiprational, love his quotes!! All of you are such an inspiration, love you ❤
I am from the UK and my dream is taking my wife to Hajj
Camera work and cinematography was absolutely incredible!!!! You feel like you’re flying with them ❤❤❤😊 Love from PENNSYLVANIA!!!
The line “a hear full of fears has no room for dreams” was super powerful to me. I used to have a large fear of heights but forced myself to overcome it so this video was especially cool to see since I get how challenging it is. (Would love to try what staffan did someday) the headspace thing was also really cool and I’m going to check it out for sure. I think that has practical applications to real life and it’s something I’ve been trying to work on! Been a fan for years keep it up guys and congrats to staffan!! #yesfam
What an amazing and inspring video! I love how Staffan, even when scared to his core, keeps spitting those inspirational quotes xD.  I myself have had a huge fear of heights my whole life but 2 years ago I started rock climbing (first indoors only but then also outdoors) cuz my best friend has been climbing for 12+ years. Now recently I have started to overcome my fear of falling by purposely making big falls (first 2-3m, last week I fell 10 meters). It's so hard to let go when you know you will take a big fall but the feeling afterwards is unbelievably good. Skydiving is definetly on my Bucket list and this video has motivated me even more to take the big leap!
Day 494. Waiting for YES THEORY to fulfill my wish. From the Philippines.🇵🇭
My heart was beating twice as fast just watching this video. As always you never disappoint with your videos, keep up the good work guys👏🏼👏🏼
This videos shots were absolutely amazing. Editing and everything. Perfection. I felt every single emotion.
Skydiving is so much fun!!! Most freeing feeling. Can’t wait to go again
Just fucking beautiful!!! I loved the message at the end love you guys!!!
Declaration of Independence is Fake never officially happened... United States are Slaves to British Red Coats 💂🏻 annually taxpayers money paid to Federal Reserve AKA British Red Coats 💂🏻 which funded both sides of WW1 France and WW2 Germany
the raw emotion throughout this entire video has honestly fuelled everything inside me to just GO, to just do it! be the eagle 🦅 I’m starting the seek discomfort package in the morning and can’t wait to dive in!
This is making me emotional and I don't know why. I'm here crying, watching this. 😂❤
The title is a stretch
This was such an amazing video, it gave me chills just watching the emotions and the power of going trough the fear of heights and just how free he felt after breaking that fear! As someone who’s anxious and scared of heights I just want to go out of my comfort zone and start living more
I’m from the UK and my discomfort is putting myself out there more and saying yes to things I would’ve usually to have said no to
The instructor's name is Vincent Descols (le Blond) he is a legend, watch his promity flying videos, will be awesome for you guys
Stephan, what a great addition to Yes Theory.
So when's MY SKYDIVE with you guys?
Whaou i can’t do that
Hi, I'm from New Zealand but live in the UK. I'm seeking discomfort later this year to reset as I turn 30 and go travel solo in SE Asia for a few months. Turns out you don't need to be settled down, have a house, successful career and family by 30. Life's not a race. Love to Staffan for his jump!
Made me super emotional LET'S GOOO STAFFAN !! ! !
I am crying tears over tears. Watching this felt impossible for me. Watching Staffan in the helicopter telling the skydivers that he loved Ammar and Tommy, I said, how could he do this? How could he? And then he did. He actually did. And that is the single most impossible thing ive watched in my life. it's changed my brain a little bit, and I can't stop crying. Don't ever stop believing that you can reach your dreams. we can all do the impossible.
Steffan's courage to face his fears had me in tears! Thanks for sharing your bravery with the world -- so inspiring! Just started the Headspace package - hoping it can help me navigate my anxiety more consistently 💕
Started your seek discomfort package on headspace! Thank you guys so much for truly inspiring so many people :)
Thats so beautiful!!!
F THIS BULLSHIT
I am Sil Jonker and i am from The Netherlands it would be incredible if you guys pick me
Okay I’ve waited to go skydiving for long enough. Going next chance I get
Amazing video, love u guys 🌸
As someone who’s biggest fear is heights, my palms were sweaty the whole time watching this😅   Watching Staffan “feel the fear and do it anyway” has given me the motivation to skydive someday and his bravery really touched me! I love Staffan’s energy and everything he brings to Yes Theory and I look forward to see him face more of his fears⚡️  I have started the Seek Discomfort package on Headspace and I am excited to see how meditation can help me to face my fears and continue to Seek Discomfort🫶   Love you guys⚡️
Wow! It's amazing how such a gripping fear for a long time can simply evaporate once you push beyond the mindblock. I could feel Staffan landing with a new sense of joy. And how the edit came together... 👏👏 Back here in Nairobi, Kenya skydiving  was introduced a few years ago but slowly gaining traction. Maybe someday...  Just opened Headspace to start the seek discomfort package.
Where do i sign up for doing this with a stranger?
Respect Staffan, you are definitely not a Turkey 😅💪💪 amazing video and an amazing team. Good to see Amar some more as well 👍
yes theory were so crazy supportive and this is an example of pushing your friends to grow rather than peer pressure i really loved it and staffan took the whole situation so well and was so optimistic when he must've been terrified well done!!!!!
it was breathtaking, bravo  Staffan
Wow I love it 🙏
I am someone who's afraid of water and swimming, but a few days ago, I did  Scuba diving, it all happened because of you guy. I came out of my comfort zone and did something that never thought would be doing it. What an amazing feeling it's to face your fear.
SO SO SO PROUD OF YOU!!!
I feel so greart about all the episodes you have done, but this one felt a bit putting him in harm's way..
love it :)
Your videos always bring a smile to my face ☺🥰 love the journey
who brought out the onions 🥲 so proud of you staffan !!
Props to Thomas, Ammar, Tommy, and everyone else pulling this surprise for Staffan! You guys make me want to skydive and keep seeking discomfort!
If you want to fly like an eagle you can’t be surrounded by turkeys 😂
Absolutely loved the video! I am planning, but not really planning, a trip to Peru in June. What I mean by that is that I know I want to go to Peru but I’m not going to research/plan my itinerary or literally anything, I’m just going to leave everything for chance and spontaneity. I did exactly that on an 8 day trip to Bali and I had the best time of my life and made so many friends.   I subscribed to Headspace with the Seek Discomfort program and I would love to skydive in Peru. I am terribly afraid of heights and I’ve never done anything daring when it comes to heights, but it’s time for a change and face that fear headon. I’m originally from the US but would love to skydive in Peru!
Thank you, YesTheory.. 💙
Heyy, everyone! I am from a small town Taldykorgan(Kazakhstan), but almost 5 years ago i got out my comfort zone, when i was just 18 y.o. I moved to Germany to study completely alone with 1 suitcase and that's it. My family, friends and everything, that i left behind are in 6000 kilometers. It wasn't and still isn't easy. Another language, another country, no people around, but finally this year i am graduating, hopefully will pass my exams, find a job in Hamburg and do my visa(my biggest stress and discomfort for now, it takes time and work, but i seek it! and everything that my life has for me!). Even if i had a lot to handle, i am still happy, i did it. Because of that decision i have visited so many beautiful places, i have seen my favorite artists live, i can feel myself good just being alone(also meditation really helped me). I just want to say thank you for doing it!!! When i need a bit of motivation or inspiration, i am always watching your videos and it makes me do incredible and cool things i want, yes, all alone, but now i have a lot of cool memories, that i will always remember! Thank you, Yes Theory and Seek Discomfort! 💛
CAN I PLEASE DO THIS?!
That’s crazy it’s been a dream of mine to be able to Wing Suit! I want to get my skydiving license and start learning but it’s really expensive! It’s crazy that his first ever jump he got the chance to tandem wing suit with someone! Once in a lifetime opportunity for sure….Great video guys!!!!
My name is Storm, from Belgium and my dream is to skydive for my 21 birthday around the 16th of october with my girlfriend who does not wanna join me because she is really afraid hahaha ;(
I’m jealous
I'm already using Headspace and have been for the past year because of Seek Discomfort. It's a wonderful tool! And holy shit...watching that video gave me goose bumps and actually got my heart rate up. Phenomenal! Kudo's to everyone who made that jump possible!
I’ve always been very socially awkward and uncomfortable around people. I’ve been trying to get better at it this year and I hope that I can. Thanks for the video guys❤
I'm from Pakistan.  Initially I was planing on doing the K2 base camp trek this season but due a fracture will have to postpone it, hopefully would be able to do it as soon as my feet heals. Being a 300lb 5'8" guy once and losing about a 3rd of my body weight it actually feels amazing to even think that id be attempting it ( inshaAllah 💙 )
I cried, so proud of your Staffan
im from the netherland and this summer im going on a vacation on my own for the first time. to dublin
9:30 the discomfort im seeking this year is, reaching to more people to get more subscribers and produce more content.
I started the ‘SEEK DISCOMFORT’ PACKAGE!!
Always happy to see the old Yes theory type of videos!!!
This is just amazing! The one dream i really want to and have to do!
Hi guys,  Gotta admit my mind’s been on the final screening of project iceman since Friday. It was so wonderful to see you irl after having viewed you through a screen for 6 years! 🩷 I always struggle to really push myself to seek discomfort. Going to Friday’s event by myself was already a thing because my brain is always feeding me reasons not to take any shots. That being said, I’m going to challenge myself by combining my experiences as a teacher and a dancer to teach the group I currently dance in. It frightens me, yet excites me at the same time. I don’t know if I would have done it without you guys. Seeing you chasing dreams is so inspiring and Staffan is such a wonderful addition to the team.  I’ll for sure teach myself and my students that: ‘a head full of fears has no space for dreams’! One day I WILL be able to seek discomfort and have my own ‘YesTheory’ type of adventure. Until then, I’ll gladly watch what you have in store for us!   Lots of love from 🇳🇱
What an insane video! Well fucking done Staffan!
I’ve started my journey! 🎉 Love your videos, love the positivity and story telling. Great all around vibes.
This is absolutely amazing, Staffan experiencing so many new things, an amazing addition to the "Yes Theory" team. I myself am from the Netherlands and my goal of seeking discomfort this year is training to run my first marathon!
the hugging, in the end, got me crying so bad <3 loveu guys
Feelt it  -India
Inspiring
You are not correct, it was an Indian person who tested successfully before wright brothers. Do a research first.
This was a cool way to really have Staffan kind of prove himself to the audience. We've all seen Thomas, Amar, and Tommy do some crazy stuff on this channel, so having this video just about Staffan really helps him feel more like a part of the group. Staffan is such a positive guy, so it was nice to have him be the "main character" for this one :)
I have a lot fear in my life. When i first this video I couldn't believe he will actually do it. I really admire your energy. Thanks for this amazing video.
Every episode I feel free with you guys. I lose myself and become one with you guys. That feeling of overcoming fear and taking the leap of faith, I wish to experience it some day, but till then, I live vicariously through you beautiful people.   Thank you Yes Theory! ❤️

Wow! Congrats  Stefan!!!🎉❤ 😊 THIS is the medicine I needed today!! Thank you guys!! Stefan thank you for being so positive and doing this! You have made my day better and made me feel like what I'm going through today I can conquer! I cried tears of JOY for you. Way to GO! 😊❤ much love to you all at yes theory
'are you sure' lmao
I wanted to do the same thing if possible even higher as I am afraid of hight and financial I am not able to it I am average Indian I think by that itself you can guess the financials but the fearful thing is never done it and I want to do it by myself
This video was a rollercoaster of emotions from a spectator standpoint. You made us feel like we were there experiencing it with Stephan, absolutely amazing work guys! I say this with tears in my eyes.
fagNation
I’m from Sweden, and I’m seeking the discomfort of going all-in as an artist, songwriter and producer!
Yes I have dreamed to fly but I'm not rich another to do it 😂
How much would this cost someone that's not rich to do ??
I get it now..... Thomas is outsourcing the dangerous stuff to stephan😂😂😂
Hi I am Rushi from India this year I will be seeking discomfort heights. By watching Staffan it feel I should also at least do sky diving to get out my comfort zone. I want get know how does it feel to do thing out of comfort zone. And In future I will explore fear of heights and depth.
Never been in a skydiving before. But it is my greatest dream! Good job everyone! Staffan you rock! :)
I have been watching and supporting Yes Theory for the past 5years recommended by one of my brother..n now i feel like a family to you all 😊 but where is Matt 😞 btw I'm from Nagaland, India please visit us 😊
This video was soo incredible.... The ending emotions i felt it hear
Time and time again you all deliver a beautiful and inspiring story to us. You’re motivation knows no bounds.
i am from india and my dicomfort is talking with people
newest yes theory video, team takes ayahuasca
nah but where can I buy that suit that shit drippy af!
ur new dud is over reacting
Felt that Hug from here.. Well Done Stefan 🎉💯   God Bless Yes Theory
That's what life meant to be
I jumped for the first time last year. When he said that's the scariest thing of my entire life but the most beautiful thing at the same time is exactly how I felt.  I was terrified when the door opened, but it was pure bliss the minute we hit the air. I thanked the instructor/owner for making me feel alive again.
My greatest fear is visiting “Dangerous” countries 🥶❄️
seeing Stefan overcome his fears gave me huge hope for myself. I myself have been feeling discomfort since a while.  Before i get to that, i want to introduce myself, i am a 16 year old student from India  I suffer from a stuttering disorder. I've been stuttering since I was 3 years old. Till this day my parents and my siblings have been by my side and did their best to help me overcome my disorder. Whenever they tried to help me I go into denial and feel like i don't need any help. One day I shifted into a completely new community, i had a real eager to make new friends and socialize but as soon as I saw them I felt nervous. I couldn't speak even a word without stuttering. I brokedown infront of everyone and went home crying, since then I never went back and spoke as little as possible. I realised that this took a huge toll on my speech. I took time out of my out life and focused on getting better at talking. I still stutter but not as much as before. Watching this video about overcoming our own fear gave me courage to share my story. I'm not seeking for a free skydiving session but I just felt the need to share my story.  Thank you.
omg, I was so stressed and at the same moment so moved. Your films awake so many emotions at the same time unlike any other films. Keep going, sending love from Poland!
Absolutely fantastic well done WOW 💯👏👌👍
I thought I was watching a fishing video. You tuber @618fishing uses the same music as when they begin their jump. See ya later buddy :)
Wish I could embrace this with my friend's! It was very awesome, congratz everybody!!! Staffan ur a KING!
I’d have walked away, he’s s brave . I’d have gotten purely angry and left lol.
This hug with Thomas was so amazing. The whole crew is so brave.
Staffan, you are such an inspiration. Not only you, but the whole Yes Theory. Thank you guys so much creating this channel. I've changed a lot in my life and in my thoughts thanks to you. It made my everyday life easier, as a teacher, as a person. I can tackle any hurdle in life much better. I can't think enough of how much I would love for pupils to understand this way of thinking, and until they do, I'll be the messenger of being a role model and fighting my fears and insecurities.  Bless all of you, much love from Sweden. /Anton
Such a touching and recognisable story. And great how Staffan has become a core member of the YES family; one could say this was his baptism of fire. Just saw the message at the end... Everything in me says I should not reply, so here I am. I have always tried exposure therapy to deal with my fear of heights (worst one was walkling on a 800m cliff on a see-through path in Georgia), but never to the extent of skydiving. I surround myself with too many turkeys and too little space to dream, so I say YES. Love from the Netherlands (where luckily no mountains exist:)).
Hi my name is khisal I am from Pakistan. I feel discomfort to meat new people basically I am an introvert. This year I am phasing my discomfort and and trying to create new connections.
Goosebumps all over my body dang 😭❤️
One of the best video of yours. I hope I can get a chance of doing this kind of adventure some day. All the best guys☝️💪
Skydiving is amazing
Exiting at 2000ft would have been much more dangerous.
Bro I'm getting a panic attack just from watching
i fucking love the nerdy way this goobers talk abou things, acting all weirdly alpha, its 10/10 comedy everytime
i wanna do this so bad haha
A head full of fears has no space for dreams❤
I can't imagine the feeling that would be. Awesome.
Shoutout to the cameraman during the skydive! Amazing moments captured on camera during and after the fall - I could feel Staffan's energy through the screen. Congratulations on facing your fear, and what an incredible connection you all have.
I’m from Pennsylvania. This makes me want to Skydive! Ah! So amazing
I've just started your seek discomfort package on Headspace and I can't wait to try it out 🥳🇧🇻
That’s my dream to fly ..
I totally relate to his reaction. Anxiety going up and once you leave the plane, everything is out of your control and you just soar. This video brought me right back to that moment of my first skydive!
I can’t help but cry 😭 I felt every emotion Stefan felt: fear, anxiety, bravery and bliss. The video really encapsulated all of that and I feel like I was there with him. I would definitely love to experience such insanely exhilarating experience one day. Kudos to YES THEORY for another masterpiece 💕
I'm from Lebanon and the Discomfort that I seek is indeed skydiving, I am 30 years old and have never done it. I signed up for the headspace package and the meditations and talks are very helpful, this week I am also seeking discomfort by attending a spiritual ceremony for the first time (the kind that have been held by shamans using a medicine brewed in certain countries in south America for centuries, I think you know what I am talking about), I know that it can be a life changing experience but also an extremely scary one, so these meditations are giving me good insight on how to navigate through moments of fear. I thought it could be a good way to prepare for such an experience. amazing video btw! I have been following you guys and your journey for a few years and its inspiring, love the content also Chapo to your video editor!
I’m from the USA and my discomfort is riding a motorcycle. I must say, this video really hit home with me. I’ve lived through several life changing experiences that started negative and turned positive but never one so visually stunning like Stefan experienced. That’s one of my lifetime goals now to get to life’s ultimate ecstasy.
I think the farthest I’ve gone to seek discomfort was a solo trip to Chicago. However… in three days I will be leaving the US for the FIRST time to study Spanish is Spain for the summer. Coming from rural Kentucky I am terrified for the changes to come.   This video is ever inspiring for I will not let the uncertainty I feel and fear hold me back. This channel has inspired so much of my work view and goals for my life. I’ve been feeling lots of anxiety and will be downloading headspace to start the Seek Discomfort package TODAY.  Thank you all.
Working through my discomfort of learning a new skill and going back to doing classes to push myself further in life.
Starting headspace today
I'm originally from Belgium, now living in Montreal, Canada. Seek discomfort is the motto I think about as much as possible to grow.  This year I'm participating in higher level karate fight competitions. I get anxious about it everytime I think about the potential injuries, but mostly when I think about how easily I could lose... Although I'm doing this to learn, grow, and become better, it's always nerve-racking to get on the mat!  But I gotta keep doing it to become better and to grow.  How I trick myself into doing uncomfortable things is to take everything one step at a time. For a competition, it would be something like: show up, put my gi on, get on the mat. Once I'm on the mat, I have no choice but to go through... So that's all I have left to do!  Amazing that Staffan got to do such an incredible jump. Maybe one day I will have the opportunity to fly as well!
I always find myself on the edge of my seat. With the biggest smiles while watching your videos. 😁😁😁😁❤
insane
I'm from Bangladesh 🇧🇩.I always watch your video.go ahead and continue because you can be best blogger in the world if you continue like this way ❤,thank you.
Sky-diving videos of Yes Theory hits so different man.Its straight to the heart beat. Sensational background music, views and oh my oh what a feelings its always been....Thanks YES THEORY....
These guys are AMAZING. Staffan, WE DID IT. You brought us in and out of your experience. We were with you, and we succeeded. To more adventures with Yes Theory 🥰
Your videos make my heart beat faster and you add positive energy to everyday life. Staffan congrats, that was huuuge!   I'm from Poland and this year I would really like to try acrobatics, but I'm scared of "not touching the ground" so it makes my little dream a bit complicated
7500 euro for this flight. I rather have a discount code (75% or so :) ) for the skydive instead of the headspace! I would love to do this!
I am eagle
My discomfort is working I want to be a YouTube star. If you ask a 10-15year old what he wants to be they want to be content creators.
Amazing
The goats 🐐
I'm from Latvia! 🇱🇻 I got out of my own comfort and I joined national guard and this july I will have training in forest with others and living there for 3 weeks in a camp. I would love to try skydiving as someone who is also a bit scared of hights..
im from iceland
I CRIED REAL TEARS
What if he just crashed into the ground at 400m an hour.
From Tunisia and my discomfort is getting a  skydive licence   hope this works somehow
"Fear doesn't prevent death like fear prevents life." Damn. I love Staffan.
I'm from the Philippines and the discomfort I'm seeking this year is to migrate to Australia! Downloaded Headspace now, can't wait to try it out tonight! Also, i LOVE this video. My god, you guys are genuine experts at inspiring more people to spread their wings (pun intended haha). So glad to be a seeker!
“Fear doesn’t prevent death, fear prevents life” INSANE perspective
I'm from France and i want to get over my fear of getting out of my comfort zone and my fear of being judged by others for it
“A HEAD FULL OF FEAR HAS NO PLACE FOR DREAMS” WOW IM INSPIRED TO FACE MY FEAR OF HEIGHTS
I love this channel
A head full of fears has no place to dreams. Love it!! Thank you ❤
I GENUINELY FELT HIS PAIN WHEN THEY TOLD HIM HE’S GONNA BE SKYDIVING MY HEART WOULD HAVE DROPPED 😂
the first thumbnail and title was better
Well done to Staffan and it looks like he had a great time. But skydiving isn't for everyone. If you're prone to getting motion sick I wouldn't recommend it. I jumped from 15,000ft and due to the air pressure change to sea level got such severe vertigo I could barely walk for about 6 hours afterwards.
Hi I’m Izzy from Australia, I just turned 21 and I am about to leave in a month for my first ever solo trip to Europe for 3 months! Having only left Aus once, this is a big step for me in seeking adventure and I hope to embrace all discomfort that comes my way! Excited to use headspace to mentally prepare :)
I don't think anyone from YES Theory will respond from just a comment here but i'll try anyway.  I've always always wanted to try sky diving--but since NOT a single person is willing to go with me, i've never done it.  CAN YOU HELP???????????????????????????
The seek discomfort on headspace is what I needed, thanks guys 🤙🏼
not crying..... <3
Staffan you are awesome!
beautiful , that is going to be the next thing on my bucket list  , aftering saving extra 1700 euros lol
Loved that line from Steffan: “Fear doesn’t prevent death like it prevents life”
He needs the “abandoned in…” rite of passage!!!
Αmmar was so needed back in these vids.!
"So we're not meeting nicolas cage. He's not here" LOL
Epic, There's so much in Stefan's expression here that I can't put words to but it is so beautiful to see
"Let's throw our "friend" out of a helicopter for likes," lol. Lawyers watching this, licking their lips, scrambling to represent Steffan for emotional distress and make $$$
11:39 "If you want to fly like an eagle you can't surround yourself with Turkeys."
felt sick watching this omg how brave 👏🏼👏🏼 well done staffan
As someone with a huge fear of heights (I can't even go up escalators without some fear kicking in), the fact the Staffan pushed through this fear to accomplish what he did is really inspiring. Skydiving is something I've always wanted to do and maybe this is the final push I needed to do it
Its scary for me on the other hand it was so inspiring to watch🎉
This met me exactly where I wanted to be. This was absolutely wonderful.  So moving, Staffan sir, you looked like you were being reborn. I honor you guys for the beauty you commit to and put out to the world. Thank you.
I’m from the US and am seeking to become more in touch with my emotions instead of locking them in tiny boxes. I suffer from emotional breakdowns because I compartmentalize them and would like to learn how to stop doing that. This video was absolutely amazing and am so happy that Staffan was able to do this!
Wow! This made me really tear up. I know what it feels like to face my fears. This absolutely proofs that your fears are only lies in your head. If you dream it, you can do it. Let go off that fear David. Thank you Yes Theory for this videos.
❤
Wow this was truly amazing to watch!
It is my dream to skydive! Congrats for being brave!
man, what i would give to do this  one day
Thank you for  the inspiring video's I am from the Netherlands and in a week I will be seeking discomfort when I start my 3 month hike across the Italian alps. Where I will be sleeping in my tent and carrying everything I need on my back. I am so scared to go, and I know it is going to be hard, but what is life without pushing yourself?
Inspiring to the core!
Love from Bangladesh ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You guys are awesome! When I'm feeling insecure I always remember you guys saying that we should seek discomfort. Even if the things that happen are not always great it's a new experience and that's what life is about! I subscribed to headspace using one of your code last year so I don't know if i'm eligible to win. But skydiving really is something that makes me really nervous but also excited!!
This episode hits like the movie Secret Life of Walter Mitty to me. The unknown, the fear, the ride, the commitment, the freedom, the relief...all the things that kept me alive was once relived through this. You guys are truly wonderful. And although you didn't get to met Nicolas Cage, I think the video is enough to call itself a National Treasure.
Im fron finland and i want to go scuba diving in deep water
my skin is all goosebumps! Amazing
The body chills and goosebumps I got throughout watching this. Well done. ❤
Super cringe. Is Staffan even your friend???
"You can't fly like an eagle when you're surrounded by turkeys"   Staffan you are becoming more and more of a legend. The yes theory and seek discomfort family loves you very much!
👏👏👏
Another banger video!! ❤❤❤
I am from Bulgaria but in the last two years, I lived in the Netherlands and Spain. In a few months, I am moving to France. So I am quite used to seeking discomfort. The two things that make me the most uncomfortable are heights and silence. I believe the biggest discomfort for me would be becoming a monk and jumping off a plane. That is why I really want to do this. :)
Ok, this one finally made me book my first skydive ❤
Anytime I come across a new video from Yes Theory, I like it before I even start watching.
i am from nepal
sooo good. In tears
I actually cry everytime these guys embrace each other. You can see how much they love each other and it's so nice to see
Why am i crying? 🥹
i’m still watching on here. i don’t even follow your TikTok to be honest. but your right. youtube is not the first platform people go to anymore but i 100% support you and view your videos. in fact i’m going to follow your TikTok tonight so i can watch more of you x i’m sorry your feeling this way
goood job stefan!
if you did this me I walk and have a breakdown but I agree if you can get pasted the wall that holds you back firstly its a wonderful feeling and secondly you rarely look back  but for me its HELL NO
I promised myself that the moment I have enough money I will try skydiving, and after that I will learn to skydive by myself.
that was amazing and touching moments !
Getting Nicolas Cage to show up at the end after the skydive was so cool!!
Amazing
And yet again I am crying on another Yes Theory video! I almost had a full blown panic attack when you told him haha
So much respect to Staffan to be able to face his biggest fear like this and walking the talk... I can never do this in my life I am dead scared of hights but if Yes Theory asks me to then I'll do it... Love from India ❤️
Awesome 💗💗💗 I’ve never skydived but want to so bad! I’ve always been terrified of heights but I want to face that fear on an epic level! I live in New Zealand 🇳🇿💗 I would be honoured to be part of a Yes Theory adventure! I say yes a lot more than I ever have because of you guys 💗 Much Love Aroha 💗💗💗

Hey, I’m from Norway, and this year I’m seeking discomfort through my newest hobby of paragliding. Yesterday I did my 60th flight which means I’m finally finished as a student pilot and am allowed to fly in new places as a fully independent pilot. Now I’ll be practicing to find and fly in lifting air so as to eventually be able to fly long cross country flights. So yeah i guess my goal is to be able to fly like a bird :)
This literally brought tears to my eyes!
Hi! I'm from North Macedonia and the discomfort that I'm going to face is moving to another country for college, the language barrier that I'm to face there and the fear of not being close to home, close to comfort is becoming real every day. It's also a step for me to become a better person and just as Stafan faced his fear, knowing it would not be easy and that would make him a better him. I am inspired to do the same. I'm eager to surround my self with eagles if I am to fly in the world❤ I've been watching your videos for a year now and they have inspired me to be a more open person and have more confidence in myself. Thank you for making such motivational, real, and inspirational videos❤ I used your code on headspace and I will dream of skydiving till that comes a reality.💙🪂
Amazing 👏 ❤😊
Recently I was encouraged by my bestfriend to save money for us to skydive and that's one of my dreams to cross out skydiving in my bucketlist. Honestly I was a bit skeptical and I was making lot of excuses like it's a little out of budget, work and such. After hearing that quote "A HEAD FULL OF FEARS HAS NO SPACE FOR DREAMS."seeing him fly and conquer his fear I know deep in me that im scared to skydive BUT I want to conquer this fear! Im currently messaging my bestfriend on how we are going to save. Hoping that we can do this too ❤ Thank you Steffan and the Yes Theory team ❤
Thomas Brag is the most fake person I have ever witnessed
Amazing..  I’m so scared of Hughes that I take medicine to go on a airplane !! I couldn’t imagine ..
I smile watching the whole video.. Everytime I watch your videos it gave me goosebumps. I really really love what you are doing..
By far one of the best videos I’ve seen in a long time!
I’m from wales and would love to go to Everest base camp. The top would be to much of a push I recon
From New Zealand and seeking discomfort by starting my own YouTube channel 😄
Sky diamonds been on my bucket list since I can remember I love to go skydiving with Amar
I think after this you should have him meet nicholas cage in compensation
I'm from Estonia (known for 0 mountains) and my discomfort for this year is learn rock climbing and successfully climb a free solo on some mountain or cliff
Hey, um. I have this incredible -desire to- fear of going to space. Yeah, it terrifies me. I'm so afraid of even the thought of it. I'm just sayin'. Ya know... Thought I'd just put that out there.
This was touching, I mean truly touching. I've always wanted to skydive, but my wife do not let me do this, as she is a hundred percent sure that I am the one who will not make it. I am scared of rights like crazy, but I love to live my life beyond these fears. I have promised to myself that I am going to do a skydive before I turn 40, which is about 9months away, so I better hurry up. To everyone out there, do not forget that life is the best thing ever happened to you, so enjoy it! I am hungarian, who lives in the US, but most importantly, I am human and enjoying my time on this blue planet. Peace!
You guys are amazing 🤩🥰🥰🥰🥰
I currently live in a desert in Saudi Arabia (not Saudi national), basically building a city from scratch and my discomfort this year will be exploring the beauty of Pakistan!  Also congrats to Staffan overcoming this discomfort, what a legend!!
Amazing moment.
This just got added to my bucket list
Love Steffen, he's lovely. But really want to know what happened to that amazingly positive aussie girl - if I remember she was unemployed at the time and basically a perfect fit for your team of 'yes'.
Skydiving has always been on my bucket list but I've never had that reason to go for it. I am incredibly desperate to have that experience and know that it's within my capabilities. My discomfort recently has been in slowing down and pausing. Putting in earphones and using headspace to take a moment each day has really helped me in doing that and I definitely want to listen to Thomas' collection. Life seriously flies by and it's so hard to live in the moment. Would highly recommend having a listen. Interesting how those surreal moments can come at either end of the spectrum: flying through the sky or sitting and meditating on your thoughts. Also, great video as always - well done Staffan. I hope to join the skydive club soon :))
Got nervous and got the chills during the entire video, was a great one! The video dropped just when I needed it, facing some fears as well.  Just tried your first videos and meditations on headspace, looks very nice. I’m curious about going through the rest of it 😁big support from the Netherlands
im not crying i promise
I just installed the Headspace to continue working on my mental health as that's been taking a back seat in my life recently. I love mountains and I hike and ski a lot, so my dream is to do heli skiing or alpine touring where I ski down the top of the mountain. This would require practice, planning and patience for the right conditions so would be a fun video. Love from Bosnia, take care.
Love Staffan
im happy for staffan
IM FROM NEW ZEALAND and my biggest discomfort is not being able to jump or make the change, feeling stuck
Its because of Yes Theory that I wanted to go skydiving for my birthday, so I brought some friends and it was all our first times. I will truly never forget that rush being the 1st out of the plane and flying back down. Its something I think everyone should experience
I’m from India and huge fan of you guys for around 2yrs , the way you guys travel and tell your stories makes me want to explore the world more and skydiving is like my first thing on my bucket list and to experience it the first time with you guys would be a dream come true
I will never say NO to you guys! <3
My fear is cramped spaces. I gets my nerves tense like nothing else.
why am i crying? feel like hugging Staffan! you made it!!! 😀
I'm from Hungary and the discomfort I'm seeking is moving from a small rural town in Hungary to the very center of Munich. The change won't be easy but I'm eager to embrace everything that comes with it. I have actually just started the navigating change course on Headspace. I have never tried guided meditation before, but now I'm hooked. Skydiving has been a drem of mine ever since I was little. I have already made up my mind and as soon as I can afford it, I will get my skydiving licence. To get the opportunity to do my very first skydive at 18 would be so incredible!!
"A head full of fears has no space for dreams" made me cry, I would love to skydive, I haven't ever done anything that extreme. Mental struggles take their toll, and I would love to be set somewhat a little free. From the UK and would love to do a skydive. Thank you guys for making such special content ❤
to do skydiving is dream <3 fingers crossed
That feeling towards the end could feel it (with tears of happiness in my eyes) 😄
This video was amazing. I'm finally getting out of the deep (and my head) after 3 years of struggling. I'm stepping into the light. I'm doing and will be doing things out of my comfort zone this year and it just feels right. This video made the confidence I already had for all that has to come stronger. Thank you.
I'M FROM INDIA AND MY DISCOMFORT IS SEEING FROM HEIGHTS, HENCE I'LL BE SKYDIVING FROM OVER THE PYRAMIDS THIS NOVEMBER!
Hey guys, can i become a member of Yes theory.
I’ve started the seek discomfort package! I would love and really fear to go skydiving one day. This video inspired me but I might regret it later when Im scared for life in an airplane. Loved the video! Lots of love from the Netherlands 🫶🏻
One day I will do skydiving for sure. Love you guys. Seek Discomfort ❤
" if you want to fly like an eagle you cant be surrounded by turkeys"... go with the eagles....You guys are eagles, spread your wings so that we can all look up to you and be inspired.....
GG DUDE
next time halo
Started and ready to go thanks to Headspace and Yes Theory.
High-level content as always <3.
video was shot beautifully
I'm from Perth, Australia And my discomfort is currently broken ribs from a Whale Shark dive in Exmouth, but my ultimate fear is that politicians won't save us from Climate Change :(   I've signed up for the Headspace package and we'll see if that helps, but I guess my ultimate goal is to become a politician and try and save this planet.
just love it..❤
He fucking looked beautymous flying down.
Hi Yes Theory I'm from Australia and my discomfort at the moment is a sort of fear for the future and regrets. When I was younger, my father passed as I was waiting for them to come to a Friends Christmas party. I was so young and clumsy that I didn't notice they weren't there that I happily enjoyed the party, food and pool. Later my Mum left and still I didn't notice after even being told my siblings were staying the night there. Anyway I got told the news in the morning and ever since I've lost my masculine role in the house and have struggled with everyday things like shaving, talking to girls and even playing sports with no one to tell me how to improve or correct me for my inaccuracies. I guess I just miss him and for what he taught me for the time he was around and ever since ive cherished the people around me.
This is incredible I'm began getting nervous ans started shaking for him. I would love to do this one to break that nervous and panicky system. Congrats dude
Gosh i love this. Could u post a video of the full skydive experience without any slowmo?
OK after seeing this i started with Headspace today.  3rd try with Meditation at all, First try with Headspace. this time ill make it an habbit. Great Videos Guys Made my day!❤
Props to Stefan, I could never
It really amazing i have been dreaming whole time to save money and go for skydiving into bucket list . When i see your video make me cry and make me want to try rigntnow . I hope one day i can seek discomfort once in my whole life pray for mee ☺️
My discomfort is extreme social anxiety and I'm doing my best to overcome it this year!!
I am from Cambodia and I always wanted to skydive and travel so I can come back and tell the most amazing stories through art and animation with the mix of my rich culture!
Im from India and Im planning a solo trip around India this year
Incredible video. Overcoming fear of heights by tandem skydiving is an incredible achievement. A wingsuit jump from 20k is quite something too! Combining the 2 is just awesome!! I bet Staffan was buzzing for a week. Breathing is a hugely underestimated way to help control your fears. I still have the fear during take off in an aircraft despite having done it hundreds of times but use breathing techniques to get that fear under control. The mind is more powerful than you can possibly imagine
Steffan u are amazing and I was breathing with u! After that and your mindset session on CN I'm pumped with great energy, which I needed so much! This year I rented my flat in Poland and start pursuing my dreams. I’ve started telling stories on YT, finished the open dive course, cause I was scared of being underwater. But I found myself doubting - maybe I should rather have a "normal life"? But u gave me energy to go for my dreams! And right now I'm seeking another challenge. And I’m pretty scared of hights. So why not make another step?
IM FROM THE PHILIPPINES AND MY CURRENT DISCOMFORT IS DIVING TO DARK DEEP BLUE OCEAN knowing I dont have any idea what's below me. And I could never consider foing meditation until I saw yes theory videos. Thank you for the free 60 days, this is a treat!
alsways nice to see your home region from above
Epic video guys!! Loved watching Staffan’s journey to overcome his biggest fear 🙌 Even at the peak of his discomfort he was able to be inspirational…”a head full of fears has no room for dreams”, that will stick! 💛🦅
This is amazing experience but I think it was a bit of unfair for Stefan. He should have been the informed ahead of time as his life is literally on the line.
Gabe from the US here. Skydiving is actually a specific discomfort I was looking to seek this year. That and entering contests through YouTube comments.
2 years ago I had never done any distance above 50 kilometers on a bicycle. Last year November I broke 90 kilometers, and on one occasion 102 kilometers at 24 kilometers per hour average.  This year I did 72 kilometers at 25 kilometers per hour. My goal is to achieve this speed over 160 kilometers this year. It started when I saw the Wim Hof video. If you could do it not knowing what to do, so can I.  Thank you from the deepest parts of my heart for what you've done and what you continue to do.
Hi, i'm Aziz from Indonesia. My biggest fears are 1 i have fears of going fast on a motorbike after broken my bone in an accident few years back. And i'm quite afraid of talking in front of a lot of people especially as i'm a pastor and have to do it often
Damn I would love to do this! Amazing video❤
❤❤❤
hi YesThoery, iam from india and iam ambitious but afraid to come out of comfortzone.Especially after the recent motorbike accident that I faces while going to work. after surgery and minor injuries I recovered completely but that incident has given me fear which I cannot share with anyone .
แม่งงง สุดยอดไปเลยโว้ยยย วู้ หู้ววววววววววววว
Wow, Stefan, what a champion!! You really showed us how to seek discomfort and face our fears head on! 👏
oh man this one had me tearing up a bit. I'm originally from the UK, solo moved to Canada to try and really really push myself out of my small comfort zone I created. My biggest fear is doing things alone, I really hate that feeling of isolation and being alone with my thoughts, so I've made a start by moving across the world, but I have almost made a new mini comfort zone here, so I'm still trying to push out of it! Keep up the great videos guys, you have no idea how much they mean to all of us <3
WOW! Staffan!!!! Amazing job! I didn’t think I would. I cried. ❤ you are an incredible person and human! 🎉 congratulations on facing your fears! Fly free!❤
I've never hugged a man
Staffan is so lucky..to get a t3am and family like that is truly amazing..this video at the end made me tear up
I watched where they jumped out of the helicopter multiple times. The scenery was so beautiful. The best part was at 18:20 where it appears Staffan transformed from a turkey to an Eagle. Face Everything And Rise moment!
I have done skydiving last year for the first time and it was one of the best experiences of my life :)
Paused halfway through the video and immediately booked a skydiving session (never tried.. but always wanted to do)
There is another theory that I'm working on, if you're actually free from fears and only live with the dreams inside of your soul, would that be a good life? Still not sure. First noticed this when I was on top of the Seoul Lotte tower bridge 555m (5nd tallest building in the world)... Had almost like blissed feeling through the experience, no fear, but a feeling that I'm wrong in some way because of this... Still, I am testing this and think the sky dive would be a good next step in my hypotesis. Live in Bosnia btw if you need that info lol....
always love of their brotherhood ❤❤ and why am I get emotional 🥺🥺
OK... Where can I buy this?! :) GET. ME. THERE!!!
Seeing Stefan conquer his fear is so amazing to watch Much love for you guys 🎉❤
"Fear doesn't stop death it stops Life." What an incredible quote.
" What if I fall?!   But darling, what if you FLY ?! "   You were soaring!  This was so incredibly beautiful to witness.  Thank you for the reminder that a head full of fears has no space for dreams. ✨   Love the collaboration with headspace. So happy for you and proud of you Thomas, I know headpsace and meditation has had a massive positive impact on your life over rhe years - and how beautiful that through this collaboration you can now have this impact on many others. Amazing. 🥳  Just signed up to it. Here's to leaving fears behind and stepping into the discomfort that will lead to my dreams. Here's to no longer chilling with the turkeys, but soaring with the eagles   Thank you so so much for this incredibly moving episode  🙏💜✨
I'm from Colorado and I absolutely love yes theory. Y'all have inspired me to go bungee jumping for my 23rd birthday in 2 weeks.    Thank you for all that you do
*The most impactful Yes Theory video I've ever witnessed. Staffan transforms those around him { and strangers like me } because he allows himself to be transformed* ♥
Uplifting and very much inspiring moment. Thank you for sharing your stories with us ‘YES THEORY’. There’s something special in seeking our own discomfort, kudos to everyone and stay positive! Well done! Regards.
21:09 " I've been breeding for one hour it feels like " - Stefan Taylor 🤨
That height is just about to the heli's limit of 21k feet or so. Very close. It's like cutting water with a toothpick. Very touchy with little feedback. Nice work staffan
So awesome to see your excitement of knocking a wall down made it all worth it! Congrats!! 🍺
One of your best videos yet. So good.
When he said "A head full of fears has no place for dreams" I just started sobbing. My life magically brought me to LA when the war in Russia began, and it's my biggest fear - heights. In 2 weeks I will have my first internship in the Oklahoma state research university and I will have to fly alone with no family or friends. I love breathwork and this is what I will remember - feel everything and rise
this is the peak of yes thoery. so far.
You never fail in making an awesome and heartwarming content!!!! ❤🥹
This year the discomfort I'm seeking is to go to university after working full time since I was 14, the goal is to come out of university with the ability to offer adventure therapy in New Zealand to help youth
Gives a new meaning to you'll be my wingman. 😂
I’m from Canada and my big seek discomfort moment will be that this summer I’m taking a solo road trip across the country. I’ve been thinking of skydiving since ammar’s halo jump but this decided it for me. This summer I’m going to go skydiving. No turkeys.
Skydiving is #1 on my bucket/wish list. One day I hope to experience it.
Love it!
I'm Dennis from Italy and i want to have discomfort by bungijumping
stephan embodies yes theory, such an inspiration for someone with anxiety and despression like myself.
I'm from Washington , US and my discomfort is pushing through my recovery process to pursue my goal of firefighting and completing an iron-man triathlon.
Stephan is one of the most unique person I’ve ever seen. I would love to actually meet him one day🙌 so glad to see you as a permanent part of the team❤️
From Cambodia and I’m looking to lose weight and get into a better shape, I know people who read this properly said it’s not that hard but for me who has ADHD and OCD is a lot harder without help from others.
Oh 😮‍💨
The love and support you guys provide to each other is incredible, I’ve been a part of this “perspective” “mantra” of seeking discomfort for a while, and I been putting my self in different situations like moving to another country without my family and I’ve grown so much as a person. I can relate with the feeling of breaking the barriers(still working on it tho). it so fulfill and inspiring to watch you guys! Can’t wait to meet you guys 🤞🏻also thanks for the 60 days free, can’t wait to hear it! Saludos desde Durango, México 🇲🇽🤍
😉
Beautiful !! 💛💛
wow I have never heard that saying a head full of fears has no room for dreams... and as soon as he said it I got emotional for some reason !!!! I love that quote and this video wow
"A head full of fears had no space for dreams" I'll keep that in mind Staffan
Bravo Staffan❤
Hi
Nice to wakeup with this nice experience :) Thanks.
Cornelius Would Be Proud.
This video opened my eyes, which were closed by my fears. Thank you Yes Theory for these inspiring stories as always, as a student in India, I never get the time or have enough courage to overcome my fears, and new fears keep forming for me. But as Staffan quoted "A head full of fears has no space for dreams", I am gonna eliminate my fear by overcoming them by as always Seeking Discomfort.<3.            P.S: Don't mind my English.
I don't know you personally, Staffan, but as someone who's living with panic attacks and high functioning anxiety, this video made me feel so proud. You're more than your fears. You deserve the world. 🩷
I am from India and my discomfort is actually saying yes to doing random things.
I am from the United States and some discomfort I am planning on doing this year is trying some very difficult backpacking trails with little backpacking experience. Although just recently I have decided that I am going to hike the PTC in spring of 2026 about a year after I graduate.
As someone with a fear of heights i understand how steffan feels. Did my first skydive last yr and now am I licensed solo skydiver the adrenaline rush is like nothing ever experienced so proud steffan went through with it.
Happy Sunday Love the caption
I’m from Cyprus and my discomfort is to drive a 23 hour ring road in Iceland together with my headspace package.
credit to the camera man. absolute job guys
This is a banger
OMG! I am BAWLING!! Such emotions. I want to face FEAR! Face Everything And RISE!
@yes theory - I have always wanted to do sky diving, do you think I can be the chosen one by you?
Respect to Staffan, i also afraid of height. I push myself these past few years to overcome my fear. Skydive is one of my bucketlist.
"if you want to fly like an eagle, you can't surround yourself with turkeys" This is one of the most powerful quotes i have ever heard
Hi I am Deepinder from Mumbai India. I have started my headspace subscription. At the age of 35 I thought it was a good time to quit my corporate job and pursue the only skill set I had -  photography. For the last 6 months I have been on a journey of self discovery and in return give myself all the chance of being happy in my own reality. As compared to a reality I was stuck in. The first discomfort I faced in this journey was saying yes, saying yes to my dreams and desire. Yes is the answer to the question I called life.
I live in the United States, I’ve never been skydiving, I would love to go and/or do a wing suit jump too
I fear heights too.👍 Amazing 🍻
Something about grown men hugging and celebrating joy just makes me so happy
Got tears in my eyes
Amazing as always but for me height has to be the biggest FEAR.
👏👏👏👏👏👏
i just went skydiving for my 19th birthday last august!! i went 14,000 ft in New jersey. it was the coolest experience and i still talk about it all the time. i would love to travel to somewhere like dubai or miami and do the skydives there because the views are incredible
Amazing! Inspirational
I am from the Philippines but I moved to the USA a year ago to Seek Discomfort. I migrated by myself last year 2/22/2022. That was very historical for me. I lived in New York for a couple of months. Worked at fast food, worked at call centers, and I joined the US Army. It was the peak of seeking discomfort last year. Overall, I am happy with what I did. Challenging myself, being resilient, and meeting people from all over the world. And now, thanks to your Headspace as I embark on a new journey. Being a member of the armed forces really pushes you to step out of your comfort zone. I've been to South Carolina & Georgia in less than a year for training. And now, I am moving to Washington State for the next 3 years of my life.   Seeing skydiving episodes really melts my heart. It's in my bucket list and I've always wanted to try it. It always cry I don't know why. It has been always a dream of mine to meet all of you and push myself more out there. If you only know how you changed my outlook in life, my lifestyle, and my dreams, you'd be amazed. Keep doing what you do and keep inspiring everyone. LETS GOOOOO!!!
I am from South Africa, and I am deathly afraid of sharks!!!!
Wow! What a jump. Beautiful camera work on the ground and in the air and awesome music choices as well.
Hi guys I know this is a long shot but it’s my my only option im stuck in the middle of a little town near Ipswich I’ve been kicked out by my girlfriend after loosing my job last Month I’ve got a job I start in two weeks is anyone able to help me in anyway 😢I hate to ask but anything would help
Fear  False Evidence Appearing Real
I am Imran and I am from Bangladesh I want to do skydive because as far as  I know no 17-18 year old in my whole country has ever done skydive in my whole country.
You have so much love for each other! ❤❤❤
I'm from Australia and I am seeking the discomfort of facing my fear and challenge of Paruesis, this has stopped me from living my life drastically over the past few years!
Fear doesn't prevent death, fear prevents life. -staffan  I'll surely keep this in mind
watching staffan face his fear has truly inspired me to push myself out of my comfort zone and do the same! After watching this video, I will be joining the eagle club and skydive on my 21st birthday this year which is something I thought I would never do. Thank you for the inspiration and motivation, keep doing what you guys do best, changing peoples lives for the better 🤩🤩 from the land down under - AUSTRALIA
Yo, whos chopping onions in here...?!!?
Thomas.  You are such a good story  teller. I mean dude you are awesome.
imagine one day some dude shows up at your house and then changes your life forever
what a boss group of brothers. so epic. so proud! well done and inspired!
This episode gave me happy tears! I'm so proud of Staffan and in awwe of how supportive the team is! 💖 Thanks for the headspace trial, I used the code right away! I'm from Dominican Republic but recently moved to Spain to confront some of my own fears, and life has been amazing lately, I'm so thankful! PS: I would lovee to join you guys skydiving next timee! 🫶
"A head full of fears has no space for dreams" That got me
I did my first skydive today! I'm looking forward to trying it again! Not nearly as scary as expected, I surprised myself with I calm and collected I was.
Well done!
You guys have knocked it out of the park with the cinematography, music and editing on this one ....Great video 👍... Keep going guys ...🥰❤️
This video really speaks to me, this year I’ve started going to therapy and meditating again to push through my crippling anxiety. I am so excited to use the headspace meditations and thank you for always lightening my week!! ❤
Crazy how you guys motivate me in a way that nothing else does... Nothing
For me, that´s the definition of love over fear. I felt the last phrase deeply, to feel the fear, but allow yourself to grow beyond, to be able to let go of the fear to hold your dreams and HOLD YOURSELF! As always, inspire I go, to fight my fears in my day-to-day life too... Big thank you for this gift
That’s freaking crazy. 😂
Awesome vid everyone involved.  I remember the first and only time I went skydiving. It was amazing and so glad I did it.  I would love to do this.
This was so incredible to watch. As crazy as it is, it actually put a tear in my eye. This whole channel is just absolutely incredible!!
Love it!! The definition of love over fear!!!, the way you guys love carried that, booff beyond amazing, hope one day I get to be that brave myself, I know I am on my way! Big hug from Colombia.
I skipped a good 15 mins to get to the point of this, and you know what....This is no longer for me.  You guys are very pretentious and your latest videos are almost embarrassing to watch.  Bye
My best friend invited me to jump out of a plane for his birthday this year. I originally told him no but after being inspired by yes theory I am going in September. I hope I can be as brave as Staffan was.
as a skydiver, i know that normal tandem freefalls are safe enough, but tandem wingsuiting? What happens if they get in a flatspin? Looks like he's using a traditional tandem rig with a drogue, but what if they flatspin and he has to throw the drogue to get out of it and it wraps around them? scary shit
This was awesome to watch ❤️
I’ve been watching and enjoying YT vids for years but this is the 1st one to actually upset me. To kidnap your friend and make him do something that terrifies him deeply isn’t cool. This really crossed the line into cruelty. I was afraid of heights growing up and then eventually was diagnosed with a rare blood pressure disorder. I learned that bungee jumping or skydiving could kill me. You guys are really lucky that Staffan didn't have a medical episode as a result of that jump. I believe we should seek discomfort but not ignore the signals your body is trying to give you. Ultimately we should all seek survival.
#1 rule of being friends with yes theory, don't tell them your fears 😅 no but seriously I'm so proud of you Staffan! That was amazing!!!
Does any one else just love Tommy? He's always a highlight in the videos for me. Esp since I too am a nick cage enthusiast and there's not a lot of us out there 😂 literally my college graduation cap had a picture of Nicolas Cage holding the declaration on it  ...                                                                                     AND Go Staffan!!! this was so awesome to watch him overcome his fear! <3
Omg!!! The way i watch this video feel like dream come true ❤❤❤ hopefully me soon. God's will 😊
Congratulations Steffan!! 😭❤️ this is so inspiring! I've signed up for headspace too, thanks for the code 🎉 I'm from Malaysia and I'd love to try skydiving someday
Yes Theory never disappoint!
I swear these guys are the horoscope girls of dudes, like "LIET THE DISCOMFORT FLOW THRU YOU". "send them love and good energy"  dude wtf do you smoke it must be damaging🤣🤣
Got me emotional.  Proud of you Staffan ❤
Fear of heights is normal. suppressing the feeling of not wanting to fall to your death is actually quite stupid
this guy sounds like he is perpetually announcing that bad bud light commercial. STOP BEING SO WEIRD you not very cinematic it just kind of drags on to long.
Tricking someone into doing this is just sociopathic, he seriously could have fainted or something and its not even funny to have actually risked this for content. There are plenty of other things that have a far greeter impact on your existence, like any real form of exercise, and not some crackhead adrenaline rush were you risk death. I for one wouldn't trust any company or any person whatsoever to deal with parachutes or even train you properly, the risk is just to high cuz people treat jumping out of planes as fun and try to "get over" very rational human fears
Canada moving to Australia to seek discomfort
You guys are great!! Every single one of your videos give me chills and make me tear up. They are perfect. Much love 🧡
so good
Incredibly inspirational, thanks for the 60 day Headspace sample - much needed, have started using the package today!  I have lately become more and more aware of how pervasive and controlling fear has been in my life, from making choices infused with mere comfort to denying particular emotions, instead of affirming them. Having recently relocated from Canada to Indonesia, I realize how much changing seasons have played a role in emotional stability and optimism with 'a new air' just around the corner. Having enjoyed a variety of different kinds of recreational climbing, ice climbing has always been something that has been a dream but evaded me due to the training and equipment required - this is the type of discomfort that I seek as I recover following a debilitating recent injury.  Creating a headspace of dreams through withering fears :-)
I have plans to go skydiving for my birthday in August and this made me even more excited🤍 I love the perspective that it’s an activity that only takes a few hours to do yet it can change your life drastically. I can’t wait to have this feeling!!
I LOVE STEPHAN!!❤
I have never been sky diving, but it is one of the few things I promised myself I would do to push out of my comfort zone. The one true fear that I have is falling, so this would be one of the hardest barriers to overcome. After seeing Steffan break through such a tough emotion was one of the most inspiring things I have seen, with that being said, I will be sky diving after my graduation next year in 2024. A gift to myself to prove that no barrier should be left unbroken. Face Everything And Rise, I will hold this saying forever. Thank you guys for continually making life changing videos and inspiring millions to Seek Discomfort. Love you guys, keep changing the world <3
Absolutely mesmerizing! You could truly feel the visceral intensity of the emotions through the screen for real. I just started the free trial for headspace and the videoa youve done seem so professional and very well made. Amazing as always YT 🤩
Song lyrics fitting I suppose "Fantastic Expectations Amazing Revelations."
I remember this guy from when they swapped lives
Hella yes Theory im from Sweden 🇸🇪 would love to get opportunit to find friend never have real friend since i was 12 years old now im 17 want to real have friend I have watch you guys videos since Will Smith video when you guys jump from helicopter love your content positiv energy always give me smile 😊wow would be amazing to meet you guys my english not the best but im trying and is beacuse im not going to college im in my bed home beacuse Have got bullied all my life and can’t get grades have problem with reading im very stupid
“fear doesn’t prevent death; fear prevents life”  wow that’s deep
I’ve finally taken the first step towards meditation thanks to you guys. It’s something i’ve put off for over 4 years now. I hope to share the positive results with you soon. Love from England♥️
That's so crazy I'm afraid of heights also one best vlogs so far just amazing the trust
Couldn’t stop crying after “a head full of fears has no space for dreams”. I know how unlikely this is but I’m gonna give it a try. I’m from Colombia and I’ve always dreamed of flying. For as long as I can remember I’ve struggled with depression, I’ve worked really hard to overcome it and to actually heal, this year I will be turning 25 I really really wanna let go of that past and do something commemorative. Btw thanks for inspiring me so much to get out of my comfort zone, and to actually face life. Love you guys 🤍
8:36 is a perfect description of why I think psychedelics are so useful for people. You experience that ultimate discomfort simply within your own mind and because of it it contextualizes the rest of your experience to show you the joy you can be finding in every day
I have the same fear as Staffan, it's so strong that I have recurring dreams of being on top of a pillar and I have no way out but to jump. I hope one day I'll be as brave to find myself a great group of friends and go skydiving. Staffan you did amazing
Pure Energy !
You make my heart, so happy! KEEP UP THE WORK
7:21 Wow, "Seek Discomfort" has never before been epitomizes into a single moment so vividly. Phenomenal!
Tommy having a Reverse Uno card in his back pocket is the funniest thing I've seen in quite some time.
Ok. Sign me up.
I genuinely cried during this video. I feel so lost in life lately. Full of fears and doubts. I have so much desire to seek discomfort yet I stay stagnant scared. I have to break out of this bubble for myself. “A head full of fears has no space for dreams” is exactly what I needed. You guys are so amazing and the joy and motivation you bring to my life is exceptional. I love what you guys do! Keep showing the world how to seek discomfort. ❤
woah
am i the only one crying rn? oh man felt like i was flying with him! Thanks Yes theory for making such Amazing Videos! Love from india
This is the best youtube channel EVER ❤
I'm 19 y.o. guy from Poland🇵🇱 and my discomfort is actually working my ass off for almost a year in Netherlands to finally visit every country in Europe (22 left🤞🏻)  by surface transport which also is a little bit of discomfort :) . I am nearly at the finish line at work and I hope time will fly faster with your seek discomfort package and 60 free days of headspace😜  Love your videos !♥️
The camera man though💀🗿
That was so sick !.......I am so happy for Staffan !....This brought a tear to my eye.
Im just thinking while watching this and imagine where Staffan would be right now if he didnt say Yes on the street that one day 😂. One word just changed his whole life 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
gold
Poor Stafan, I hope he doesn't get diabetes after all that stress, please check his blood sugar
This was fantastic to see! I remember jumping out of the plane once a long time ago, it made me feel like i can do anything after that. The last couple years have  been challenging and i built up a lot of anxiety bout things i didnt used to have anxiety about. I know watching seek discomfort videos and everyone pushing comfort zones has slowly helped get me out of my comfort zone. If i had the money i would love to go skydiving again, as i know skydiving would help let me face other challenges. Once on the adrenaline rush, of facing one fear any fear can be faced. Thanks guys for the powerful messages of overcoming fear, seeking discomfort, to be able to live a meaningful life.
Great editing!
I’m only 1:57 in and stopped to comment that I love Stefan so much! I remember when he was just a soul who crossed paths on your channel and his vibe was so amazing. I’m glad he’s here now with you all and now I’m going to press play and finish the episode knowing Stefan crushes this ..
My biggest discomfort is letting go and enjoying life and feeling like I can spend my hard earned money on myself, instead of being in survival mode and feeling like anything can happen and I would need that money since things are so tight. So I am really frugal and pretty much do whatever is free/cheap
I'm from New Zealand and released my first single a month ago! This was a huge discomfort for me as it required me to expose myself to the world in quite a personal way through my music. I'm also terrified of heights and am already regretting entering the skydive giveaway as I'm typing this! Awesome video - A head full of eagles has no space for a Turkey of Fears <3
Hey you guys are the best I’m 19 and going to be 20 in September. I’ve always loved your comfort and honeslty I just want to travel outside the us and talk and learn a language and experience new stuff it could be wherever in the world. Much love
Hey i'm from Morocco, i'm seeking discomfort and  my dream is to try skydiving and i know for sure that discomfort  makes dreams came true 🥰😅  Abire
damn i wanna try this experience so bad this looks incredible amazing documentation well done guys 🔥
Just started the seekdiscomfort package, i know Meditation is good for me, i've always wanted to try it. Every Video you guys upload feels a little lifechanging for me...I Love that. I hope you all never change and make the world, and life in general (in my optinion) bit by bit a little more what it should be like :) Lovely Greetings Lolo
This is incredible you guys are such an inspiration
Skydiving is also one of my biggest fears. I loved watching you conquer this, absolutely incredible. So proud of you!
There are no feelings to describe free fall. I wish more people could experience this. It is truly amazing.
Man that camera man is a straight up bad ass. Thats impressive. Such a good episode
The way you beautifully guided your cherished friend through this.
The videos have gotten so funny over this year. So much fun! Love you guys!
I’m speachless. Another piece of art and inspiration from Yes Theory.   “A head full of fears has no space for dreams.” This is nothing but the true, I know but while I’m always telling me to do something different, to feel alive and seek discomfort, I never do. From simple things, as trying new dishes at a restaurant or skydiving, I much prefer staying in my comfort zone, which is dangerous. If you don’t seek discomfort, you’ll never grow and overcome your fears.  I must leave my comfort zone.   As always, thank you for inspiring us and bring amazing stories from all over the world. 🇧🇷  I’m editing this comment just to say that I’m overthinking and afraid to be chosen and maybe be in a video, speak English (I can have a conversation in English!) and do something I want but I don’t seek enough discomfort.
No matter topic, seems I cry every video and I'm 53
I've always been afraid of pretty much everything outside of my daily routine. I've been watching you guys blossom for years now and I've always wanted the opportunity to have someone push me into doing something that would forever change my life. I'm hopeful you'll read my message and help me close my "Fear Door" 🙏
“FEAR” Face everything and rise. Stefan what an amazing and emotional way to overcome your Fear. Yes theory you never disappoint!
Fear doesn’t stop you from death, it stops you from living…. Some real shiii right there.  Awesome video.
I love that your turn dreams into goals for people, it's too late for me, but I love that for you.  Love your videos.
I am from the USA and this year I am seeking discomfort through battling change in my life that will lead to personal growth and hopefully help me achive goals I never thought I could.
This is insane
Yes theory impresses me with its mission and what it's all about.
Straight up happy tears watching this as soon as he left the heli just wow awestruck
1 in every 500 wingsuit flights results in a fatality due to human error, equipment failure, weather conditions and other hazards. That is insane.
"I want to fly like an eagle and not be surrounded by turkeys" 😊
😎
Wow this video is soooo inspiring, I was crying so much at the end. I really felt every emotion you guys were feeling like I has physically there. I wish to one day experience this kind of feeling too. Thank you Yes Theory for always Seeking Discomfort ❤
The double UNO reverse card telling Staffen the truth but making him think it’s a front when in fact they where telling him the truth… kinda 😂
You guys always make me feel just the most deep raw feelings and emotions in your videos. Thank you for the content! Keep up the hard work. If you want to fly like an eagle you can’t surround yourself with turkeys!
I have pretty severe fear of heights, yet I do high diving and big air snowboarding. I get a full body reaction, even when I just see others get close to a cliff or just watching videos (full body reaction, sweaty hands & feet, breath, numbness, ..). The exhilaration after overcoming it has pushed me into these sports since I was a kid in the 90s. Yet I've never skydived! "Seek discomfort" and "Yes theory" have put into words what I've pursued and loved since I can remember. For those with the same understanding I can really recommend high diving (jumping into water) to anyone who wants to get experiences into that direction. The benefit/cost ratio is great as the consequences are really low (mostly just pain, almost never injuries compared to "traditional" sports like soccer, cycling, ...). And working on my breathing and meditation is such a key in that journey - these videos aren't exaggerating it!
It's been some time since I thought if I should trust headspace and give it a chance to reduce my anxiety. Of course, the thought of winning the skydive amazes me, but I know that you aren't promoting it if you didn't think that it could really help people and share what you've yourself experienced. I started the seek discomfort package and can't wait to see what happens next. side note: thank you for changing my life and my perspective on facing fears. I've met a lot of people from the yes fam community all over the world and had amazing experiences thanks to this channel. Some people from London and I got seek discomfort tattooed as well, since it means a lot to us <3 Thank you from the bottom of my heart
Awesome videos sorry I’m so late
This feels slightly f***ed up...  I'd be so pissed, then when you consider they're not just his "friends", they're his employer. Yikes. I get that it worked out for him but don't do this to people when there's a power dynamic like that, it's not fair.
This is some real life tears of the kingdom but much more touching
That wasn’t a very long free fall.  Only about 20 seconds longer than if a normal jump from that altitude. I guess a tandem wingsuit doesn’t allow much air time. Cool stuff though.
This video made me smile the whole time. :)
Inspiring
As a long time Yes fam member who saw Thomas face his fear of heights and person with a HUGE fear of heights...this is both beautiful and inspiring 🖤 Way to go Staffan ✨️🫶🏼
If only Abbas Ibn Firnas could see our wing suits now.. he would loose his mind
A head full of tears has no space for dreams. 💛
Wow big ups !
I'm from the netherlands and i've had this exact skydive on my bucketlist!! the discomfort im seeking right now is that im going through surgery for the first time tomorrow (not really a positive discomfort but a needed one) also i just started the seek discomfort package which is exciting and will help me get through the surgery and rehab after
⚡⚡⚡⚡Got the SEEKDDISCOMFORT60 package. I've listened to the first section about defining discomfort, i love how its been structured in a way to fully get back in touch with myself and help me piece together my own discomfort challenge. I'm curious about the journey it will take me on, and how Thomas redifines discomfort in the final section. ⚡⚡⚡⚡
This would be an absolute dream.
I cry at so many of your videos because they’re so inspiring and full of love, you guys are the best ❤️
Yes theory just keeps getting better and better.
Grrrr why does every episode get me to cry. I’d give anything for a friend group like this. It’s so hard where I am because everyone is already part of a group or doesn’t want anything to do with others. That’s my biggest fear is trying to find a quality friend group as a shy introverted person.
dick move forcing that dude to jump like that for the first time
im not gonna say the fear of heights isnt real, i think it is the fear of falling that people confuse it with
I used SEEKDISCOMFORT60 and started the headspace trial.  I am from Germany and I will go outside my country and travel alone for the first time in my life. No friends, no family, just myself, a partially booked travel and then go from there. I have no idea what will happen or where I will end up. If I can mange to finance it, I will even go to japan without even knowing the language.   I also never went skydiving or similar, but it is also on the list of things I fear but want to do.
Well done Steffan. Truly inspiring. Great episode 😊
This was so amazing and beautiful all at the same time. I think I felt it with him 😊
i cry way too often on this channel 😂
This is really random but a baseball cap looks great on Staffan
My butthole is puckering watching this video
Staffan is my favorite member now, I love the way he met the group.
I have no words for what you guys did for Staffan. That is super powerful, i could feel the energy and the love flowing through my mobile screen, the moment he touched down and you welcomed him, that literally put me in tears, tears of joy of course. What an amazing thing to do such a thing for someone we truly and strongly love and care for. Keep it up please and keep spreading those messages of love, support and positivity. YES all the way.
I love this content it makes me so excited 🎉
I'm from Finland and the discomfort im seeking this year is embracing the uncertainty of life. P.S. I just redeemed the code!
Staffan remains my all time favorite new member to the team. I’m proud of you brother. You guys inspire me beyond belief. Seek discomfort!
Loved this thank you guys and a big shootout too Staffan what a Turkey!
Man im scared of even going outside alone in public lol. basically scared of life itself
In 2 weeks from now I'm going to have a wingsuit instruction course and make one of my dreams come true after nearly 10 years of skydiving.
One day I’ll wing suit fly it’s a dream of mine. Love the vid guys keep it up❤️🔥🇿🇦
The heartbeat sound effect into the chopper blades sound 👌👌
Day 493. Waiting for YES THEORY to fulfill my wish. From the Philippines.🇵🇭
I laughed so hard at 11:12
I'm Not Crying!!!
Probably my fave vid from you guy. This was amazing.
This is what we’ve been missing! Literally just made lunch and delayed my day to watch this. Love when you guys make me feel like it’s Christmas morning.
guys you are just awesome!
I'm from Bulgaria and my discomfort is skydiving.
Amazing. Im crying just watching and tempted to try to face my fear of heights also. This is so inspiring. Shoutout to the editors and all the people that filmed this. It was beautifully done 💜🙌🏻
You guys are the best! Thank you for another great feeling!
Adding Staffan to the team was the best decision you guys have ever made. Love the Turkey quote from him at the end LOL
Yay go Steffan! unreal video showing fear but amazing courage from friends!
Amazing!!!
Your videos always fill me with so much emotion, inspiration and bring me to tears. I am so thankful for all of your videos! It is one of my dreams to go skydiving with you guys! It would be so amazing! Much love from Vancouver, Canada <3
I wish I could face my fear like Staffan, but so far, I haven't been able to do so! I am taking very small steps though, so I think every step counts?   *it's not fear of heights btw, I've done skydiving before and I loved it 😊
Big up to Stefan for stepping up to the challenge
This was beautiful ❤ Thank you for inspiring so many people with your powerful messages and kindness ❤  I'm so glad this channel exists!
Hi, I'm someone that has never been afraid of strangers talking in public deep sea or animals I like to challenge myself to see what am capable that was until 6 months ago when I met her still today I can't get the courage to tell her how I feel about her. I think we all have our places of discomfort see high places talk to strangers animal or whatever but sometimes this little but important things are what make us more uncomfortable
im going skydiving wish me luck
Call me crazy but this has a very frat hazing vibe to it
Incredible episode
Tennessee, USA here! Congrats Staffan!
"fear does not prevent death... fear prevents life." GADDAMN STAFFAN THAT REALLY HIT
who else likes watching Yes Theory 👇
Wow! Amazing! Such awesome videography. I identify so much with that mindset of the fear of high places and falling. Such a neat story.
IM IN NYC USA AND I REALLY WANNA GO SKYDIVING WITH YOU GUYS   my discomfort I'm summiting now is starting my own youtube channel and becoming a creator   AMMAR LETS GOOOO
Hey guys I'm from Chicago, IL and I've never been close to swimming in deep water. the deepest water I've been in was at the lake it was about 10 feet. I have this irrational fear that something is gonna grab/eat me..... I'm just as terrified of lake Michigan as I guess I would be of the ocean... I will go in the water at the beach but my feet have to touch the floor and if not my heart sinks to my stomach... so I would like to spend a day or two with you guys and over come this because I wanna be able to travel soon n go swimming
Has anyone else noticed the spot in the top right corner at 6:17 that has shown up in a couple yes theory videos?
Another well-edited video ❤
makes me wanna go skydiving, 20 years of being scared of hieghts, event scheduled for my birthday nxt month for sure!!!
I'm from Belgium, I started the seek discomfort package and my discomfort is being more spontaneous and just going with the flow. Normally I am someone who wants to plan ahead a lot, but as a result I miss experiences/activities that I really wouldn't want to miss. So to go and skydive on a spontaneous way would be perfect to do it.
Heey guys i wanne suprise my mom to go skydiving so i plan to get my mom a sky dive from 19000 ft its the highest we can go in the netherlands...... but its expensive i will do it alldough i have a feaf of heigtths but if you guys could help he make this come thru i will be forever gratefull i think this is a amazing thing to help me plan out cause i am afraid of heigts and so is my mom  but cause of your videos im willing to do it  and i hope yiu guys see a great uppertuniti for a great experience
15:20
This one gave me all the feels! Amazing job, Staffan and Yes team!
I totally cried. So proud of him. Im petrified of heights too! You just Seeked your Discomfort🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Staffan is such a fantastic person. His energy fills me with such joy, glad you didn't pass out :D. Starting today the seek discomfort package!
You never know the adventures you will have when you escape your comfort zone. For me, I am currently a recent college graduate and onto a completely unknown step in my life. In under 3 months, I will be moving out of the country to a brand new place where I know nobody. (This is my first time out of the country!!). Always love the journeys and the stories that are shared with you guys. I feel so lucky to have found this channel from the beginning and it has continued to motivate me throughout my life. Much love and appreciation.
One of Nicholas Cage’s most moving performances yet. Beautiful film, Nicholas Cage. 10/10
STEFFAN!!!!!!!! i needed this episode. thank you for your vulnerability and for reminding us what this channel is all about <3
I've signed up to headspace using the SEEKDISCOMFORT60 code and my biggest fear is probably isolation, but in a subterranean region, they've persistently existed in my nightmares. I live currently in London. See you lot later ;) cheenies
On the top of the bucket list ❤
❤❤❤❤
do something cool like before not the same shit
I love this for Stefan. Tears of happiness were streaming down my face by the end.
I love Yes Theory and have been following you for years... but I must say this is the first time I felt that one of your 'challenges' was kind of mean.. Especially as a surprise like that when it must have been really hard for Staffan to say no. Taking someone's worst fear, which also is quite dangerous, and forcing him to do it on the spot doesn't sit right with me. I'm all for saying yes and overcoming your fears but I felt way too bad after watching this....Especially after seeing him having such a bad physical reaction to it. Not everything has to be so extreme, this felt more like it was made with the goal of getting high views. And as I said, I've never felt this way watching your videos before.
Congrats Staffan, so happy that you were able to face your biggest fear, you must be looking at the world a bit different now. Your Yes Theory family's support is contagious. Now you can make an appointment with Nick Cage one day to go sky diving together : )   Much love Staffan
Thanks for the free 60 days, HeadSpace is one of the greatest App!  My discomfort is to get out from my country and live in foreign places on my own. I fear that I won't be able to meet new people and I will be alone there.
A couple years ago I went to go sky diving and there was a fatality in front of me, two jumpers parachutes got tangled up and someone didn't go home to their family that night. They closed skydiving for the day and I haven't gone back since. Watching this video, I felt so much joy for, and with Steffan. I would love to get over this fear with Yes Theory!
Am I the only one who doesn't like Stefan and gets strange vibes out of him?
That was Epic. Love the journey
Hey guys, I'm from Slovenia!  I have started the Seek Discomfort package and my discomfort are heights. Ever since I was a child, I remember my mother saying that it was her dream to experience a free fall, unfortunately due to getting older and discovering that she has an irregular heartbeat, that dream has slowly disappeared. I would still like for her to experience a simulation of the feeling without any actual possible complications. Love what you guys do and what you stand for :)
yall never disappoint. what a crazy video
Hi, I've just signed up to a political party. I'm a scientist and I have had enough of complaining about how scientific policies. I want to bring change. It's been a rough few years. My mum and best friend died, my sister got stage 3 breast cancer but is doing well 🤞, my daughter got diagnosed with a chromosomic deletion, I've been through a divorce... And yet I have so much to thank for, and so much to look forward to. I have a lot of support and I have a job I love. I want to seek discomfort and skydive! I've signed up to Headspace with your promo. Thanks for the gift, let's give it a try! ❤
Just balling in the airport. Just so good.
I wouldn´t be able to push myself to do something like that even though I love watching skydiving videos. You give me motivation to at least push myself through small hurdles.... :) seeing others facing their fears from my chair is fun and also sparks a little bit of jealousy. Thank you
Even i started crying when i saw steffan overcoming his fear! Thanks for being there for him. I would love to go skydiving with you guys😍
You were tricked?  I don't believe it
This was absolutely incredible to watch and had me in tears
The smile in my face when he landed 🥲
I’m from Italy and my discomfort is to feel lonely
I’m from denmark, and my biggest discomfort would be living in complete darkness for 72 hours, be buried alive Or do paragliding.
Hi Yes Theory. As a Swiss Citizen i really enjoy these videos were youtubers come to switzerland to film videos and see how beautiful this country is. Where exactly in Switzerland did you jump from?
🚀
Golden like always!
Bro I always wanted to sky dive , I live in Romania and ever since I turned 10 I’ve been wanting to skydive , I wanna feel above everyone else even if it’s for a minute , I wanna forget that the rich control the people
A ten minute flight on homemade wings back when money hadn't been invented so you couldn't even buy anything decent to help yo dumbayuss out lol, erm, so ten minutes you say huh? apparently? Yeah why not 😌....sounds legit enough👍🏼. Awesome video guys (again 😊🙏🏼).  God bless 👍🏼🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Kudos to the cameraman
I wish I could do this stuff one day
This was beautiful.
"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain." - Dune, 1965
You guys really hit the uno reverse I am laughing so hard oh my gosh 😂😂😂
Awesome video!
Absolutely incredible guys! Steffan is such an amazing addition to the Yes Theory team! Thanks for everything you do
amazing experience i really hope one day i get the chance to try it also
I COULD ONLY WISH
I'M FROM EGYPT AND MY DISCOMFORT IS LACKING MEANING IN LIFE .
Who gave me onions. Yikes 20:19 Powerful moment.
Reverse UNO!!!😂  OMG! Things of legendary proportions... ❤🎉  Gosh this is keen as I have trouble on a 2 step, kitchen stepping stool.😳🥹😳🤡💙🤍🦋🦅🐦 Why are my eyes watery...
I was just thinking that I've never heard of tantum wingsuits before lol. That's amazing!
Hey yes theory I’ve been dealing with family problems lately and I’ve been meaning to start headspace and u gave me a free code for 60 days thank you for that + I am a Libyan 🇱🇾 living in Egypt 🇪🇬 and I would love to be on the next skydiving journey as I’ve had a fear of heights for my whole life, other than that much love and take care YES FAM!!!❤
These guys are amazing! Staffan is really lucky to have them. The cinematography is on whole new level. This stuff should not be for free. Premium level content
You know when a video is good when it makes you nervous
Hey! I'm Kate from the Philippines currently living in Dubai. I have been feeling very anxious lately and I would say that would be the biggest discomfort I’ve ever faced upto this day. I really admire Staffan for having the courage to face his fear and it showed me that discomfort is only temporary and that it could be scary but once you face it, it could be one of the most beautiful thing that happens in your life. I've just used the code SEEKDISCOMFORT60 in headspace and would like to start using it to help me meditate and keep me strong mentally to face my "discomfort". Had the privilege of seeing Staffan, Ammar and Anders at the premiere of Project Iceman in Dubai which was incredible. Thank you Yes Theory for inspiring us to keep on seeking discomfort and for reminding us that the greatest things in life exists out of our comfort zone ⚡️ 💙
Wow- “a head full of fears has no space for dreams” I needed that. and I’m saving up to go skydiving next month with my cousin for his 18th birthday!! ❤️💪🏻
Greetings out of Switzerland you go right by my hometown so cool
Hell yeah Staffan!!!
I’m from the United States California and i am seeking discomfort by doing cold plunges 3 days a week.
Hi guys, your videos make me smile. Thanks for everything you do!  I recently went through my first heartbreak initially thinking that I knew what love was but battling to find the strength with how hard dating is and finding someone who’s sees me for who I am without having to swip right and get ignored. Nothing more discomforting than rejection knowing you have what it takes. Time to challenge myself
It's really such an inspiring story and such amazing videos you guys make! I get goosebumbs eveytime I watch them. I used your headspace code and I'm an 18 year old from Portugal and I myself didn't though I was afraid of heights until I went to a kids place for a birthday and couldn't jump from a tower that I climbed (with safety gear). That was the time I realised I was actually really scared, it would be a previledge to skydive and seek discomfort!
Sky Diving is something that I've been forever dreaming of! and now finally as an International student working part time, Ive been saving for it someday! Seeing the team do such daring jumps only gets me more excited for my chance to come soon!!
The Editing on this is NEXT LEVEL! Such a good episode! Thank you Staffan for sending it!
"A head full of fears, has no space for dreams." Goosebumps.
I felt very anxious watching this, I knew exactly when and where I would’ve panicked and backed out. Watching Stephen do this really encouraged me and made me feel lighter. I too have a fear of heights and it looked absolutely free to watch him fly in the air. I felt a little discouraged comparing myself to him because I’ve been having a really hard time even leaving my house to go down the street to school.
Sad stefan was lowkey forced into doing this for “the veiws “
Hey guys :) just singed up! I'm Viola from Germany: I have two discomfort I want to overcome in this year: firstly to just be myself and embrace what makes me me and secondly solo traveling in east Africa. I have long been a very self critical person, which has restricted me from doing and trying new things in fear of looking stupid, not knowing how to do it first and just not being good at it. I've assimilated with people and hidden certain character traits just in fear of showing my real self. I've realized that this mindset will not get me to the places I want to go in life so I am aiming for overcoming the discomfort of being a more genuine self.  Also I want to go to easy Africa, I haven't decided on the country yet, possibly Tanzania or mozambique. That decision will be made within the next weeks and then in my semester break I will fly there. The hospitality of east Africans always amazes me and I am looking to park y world core somewhere and really try and see the world through some other eyes. I want to do couch surfing, cook some local vegan meals, dance with some people, go to the beach and just have a good time and connect to people I would have otherwise never met.
They're like "Surprise!" Steffan's like *cry* "Thanks." Yes Fam: You're fine! Steffan: *heart attack*
I'M FROM SWITZERLAND AND MY DISCOMFORT IS THE COLD
Push your comfort zones to the max and learn how to ride motorcycles!!  Would love seeing a video of one of you guys learning that!🤣
I'm Jonny, I am 24 and I am scared to death by sharks. Thanks to you I know that someday I will now have to swim in open water with my biggest fear. Somehow I am already scared and excited. But I'll do it, no matter what.
Wow.  Scared shitless.  All to Staffan for going through!
What an amazing video! Staffan, we are so proud of you, you are truly inspirational person, lots of love <3
He really went from someone you guys ran into a video to an official member we all like,hope Steffan stays a while
Only watching this video got my heart raising! I have started, Let´s seek discomfort!
This is just crazy. Skydiving alone is a huge fear of mine. But to have friends trick me then out of nowhere have to do something this extreme. I have no clue how I would do in that situation. Terrifying. It’s just something I said I would never do in my life. Same with bungee jumping.

Poland I recently got out of a 4 year old toxic relationship and now my life flipped 180°. Now im on the journey of trying to love my self. Love you guys keep up spreading the positive energy and wisdom.❤
Thanks for the free 60 days!  My discomfort recently has been trying to start my own art business and put myself out there to the world and be vulnerable. Ive been asleep and cruising in my comfort zone for so long that it’s time to shake things up. I want to know what it feels like to be alive again, and a skydive is surely one way to do that 🤸🏼  Amy from New Zealand
I AM FROM INDIA AND MY DISCOMFORT IS STARTING A NEW BUSINESS
Staffan, we absolutely LOVE you! Congrats on your first skydive! LOVED watching this episode!
Oh man! This video made me cry! I can relate to him so much.. I'm also afraid of heights, at the same time i kinda wanna experience how it is to be skydiving. This video just strengthens that wish..  And i also will try out headspace, thanks for the discount! Love from germany❤
Amazing experience🎉
One of your best videos ever - exhilarating
I have a fear of guns ! I want to try but I can’t muster the courage to do it ! Seem simple but when you watch more than one person get shot and killed in front of you my thought process changed !
I signed up for headspace today using the code, and my seeking discomfort for 2023 is to finally be comfortable in my own skin - knowing I am okay to take up space in the world and soar to new heights and stop fearing it and stoping myself from living - fear prevents this 💛 and that’s my goal for 2023
As someone afraid of heights, I feel the fear reaching me through the screen just watching the heights in this video. However, I am proud of Staffan for pushing through and seeking discomfort and taking on this fear head on. LETS GO!
United States and I’m working on my fear of heights! 😅 I can’t even stand on a step stool without my heart racing and my palms sweating but I am determined to overcome it!
'Are you sure?' One of the most epic uno reverse responses in history.
This is amazing experience I do one time for my life inshallah
Im not gonna go for a big seek of discomfort this year, although next year when i have saved up a good amount of money, i will go alone on a world tour by myself. I will for instance have skydive on my bucket list! Seek Discomfort!
You guys have the most inspirational videos of anyone on this platform. Loved this. Congrats, Staffan!
I swear every video they have skydived they have the worlds best camerman
The icing on the cake.......Nicolas cage waiting at the top for him to skydive with him
now we need to see Stefan do an abandoned in… video
Wauw, really moving video. I could almost feel the emotions of Staffan. Even felt a bit sick of fear like he did. Thanks for bringing such a positive message into the world.
hey guys love ur  videos <3 keep up ur amazing work inspiring others my biggest discomfort is talking to people espically girls  i do think i dont have fear of heights but i really wanna find out and i always wanted to skydive but i dont think i ever will or my parents would ever agree! ya love u guys and thank you for inspiring me and everyone else to keep seeking discomfort!❤
I just can’t fathom how he is so afraid of heights and when he got a real panic attack when you told I thought it was like to much to spring on him! But he actually did it! I am inspired nothing is scary compared to that!
I have no words for what you guys did for Staffan. That is super powerful, i could feel the energy and the love flowing through my mobile screen, the moment he touched down and you welcomed him, that literally put me in tears, tears of joy of course. What an amazing thing to do such a thing for someone we truly and strongly love and care for. Keep it up please and keep spreading those messages of love, support and positivity. YES all the way.
I'm from the USA, and this year I am going to attempt to go Bungee Jumping for the first time.
I'm in the U.S originally from Brazil and raised in Colombia. This year I'm trying to drop my first album and get into art school.
Wooow this teared me up…. I was so proud… holymoly. That must have been so scary, even I felt fear watching it. So proud of you for doing this❤️
Yes theory. How's the Grandma from the country that doesn't exist doing? Can you go back?
Way to fly like an eagle❤️‍🔥 I'm so happy for you guys! Wing suit flying has been my dream since 2011
Love your videos, always touching and emotionall. Makes me think of life in different perspectives
This was one of the most beautiful things I have watched
I just love you guys. Period. Did I cry again? Yes sure! But, wow! ❤
Good job Staffan! I absolutely love that quote, " a head full of fears has no space for dreams". If I may add a little to it, "a head full of fears has no space for achieving dreams". I have a lot of dreams but fear has kept me back from almost all of them so I 100% agree!
Wow, the video left me speechless. Staffan is such a big inspiration and the positivity he brings out is so special. Thank you for always sharing such powerful stories! And yes theory x headspace, can it be any better?   I am from Bulgaria and this year my biggest discomfort is finishing my internship since I realised I don't enjoy the job and the environment but at the same time I am learning a lot so I am pushing to help me evolve even further. Your videos always help me remind myself that I am strong enough to go through anything, thank you!
What a beautifully human experience. The filming and  scenery, while diving was some of the best I've ever been able to view.
I left a snarky comment before watching this but nah...  The message here is very important.  Keep your breath under control and let the feelings flow through you.   Be a presence to your emotions.   A head full of fears, has no space for dreams.   The old Yes Theory vibes for me ❤
Wing suiting has always been one of my lifelong aspirations along with climbing Everest but that likely won't be possible for me due to my asthma. My goals and my fear of heights is one way I overcome fears as it helps me conquer them by going above and beyond where fear can hold me back. I didn't think wing suiting would be possible either so a few years ago I did the highest skydive in my home country of New Zealand and it was the most incredible experience. But now I know tandem wing suiting is possible due to your eye-opening video, and I instantly jumped online to see the requirements. Last time I weighed myself I was 84.7 kilos so almost too heavy but still just within range. This experience of soaring through the clouds and watching the world rush past me is my dream. I am so happy Staffan got to experience his but am so jealous of him
"If you want to fly like an eagle, you can't surround yourself with turkeys" amazing quote, had me rolling
I love this episode!  I'm starting the Seek Discomfort package tonight 😊  I'm from the US, living in Germany, and I would like to seek discomfort by lead climbing in the Alps 😅
i hope everyone know how dangerous this is he has more balls then 98% of people
However, I've been skydiving myself  but never above 15k feet... I would have to say currently...my current fear would have to be here on Earth 😄,  literally swimming in the depths of the ocean since I can't swim.. and being surrounded by sharks.. and my biggest fear jelly fish.. I know weird.. but, that's why I'm changing careers and heading out into the ocean and living and working on the ocean I hope to co front it someday in the near future..
This one made me tear up a bit. What a beautiful display of life!!
The timing of this video is amazing for me as I decided 2 days ago to do my first skydive. It is booked for June 8th and I was kind of nervous but now I am super excited after seeing this love u guys ❤️
And here is me,sitting on my couch watching this amazing video,almost crying cuz 2 weeks ago I decided to walk out of a plane because I am too scared to fly,couldn’t get out of my head and I don’t know if I will ever find the courage to fly,Stefan you are a brave brave brave person. Beautiful FRIENDS ,beautiful FAMILY
I don't intend on winning the giveaway because i'm not 18 but I wanted to share my discomfort this year. Ive really liked this girl and I think she likes me but i'm to scared to ask. This seems simple but I've struggled with social confidence my entire life talking to people and especially asking a question as big as this. And I always here people say the most she can say is no but its not so simple. I hope someday sees this and can relate to this in some way
Been dreaming to do everything that makes me scared or nervous about soemthing. Thats the bell for DO IT 🌟  U GUYS are amazing and thanks for sharing great positive energy.   After all the years i finally booked a trip for 6months+ backpacking, no idea what to feel just that i know thats happening and you are a such an insipiring people. Once again big up for your motivational and stay awesome 🫶  Best regards, Sam
Hi yes theory, I am Esteban from Ecuador, I do not have fear of the heights but once I had fear of living, through my high school years I suffered from social anxiety what lead to being harassed by my peers along all of those years,  after graduation I fell into a depression that I slowly overcome listening / reading / and trying to understand why does things happened to me, on this journey I made the commitment of doing one Bungee jump, that will represent me facing this fear of living that I've been facing for all of this years , that jump really hit me hard I remember crying of emotion after achieving this goal. Things have worked out great since that period of time, I am soon to be married and start a new family , al tough I am doing good , there still on me some wounds on me that I am working to heal, would love to skydive and get the chance to meet you. Thanks to anyone that is reading this message, and thanks to yes theory for make this world a better place Love  Esteban
Amazing!!
Doesn’t look like a twin turbine heli, which is about the only one able to reach 25k feet, I jumped out of them for a living, rare to find a heli go that high. Think someone’s been telling lies 😂😂
Incredible video, literal goosebumps!
This was amazing
Staffan is a treasure. Protect that man. He is the perfect addition to Yes Theory.
How will you choose people for the skydive?
Hey Yes Theory, I'm from England and have just signed up for headspace. I'm going into my third year of university and I'm terrified of what's to come after I finish. My biggest discomfort is definitely heights and doing something I'm petrified of, like Skydiving, might make me cope with these next few years a lot more easily 😅
Great episode!!! I will definitely be trying and using the HEADSPACE code.I currently live in Argentina an this year im finishing everything to go and study abroad for a semester. For me it is a huge disconfort being without my famili for such an extensive period of time. I ultimately think this will be a life-changing experience, but that doesnt mean i will not be scared of doing it. Loved the episode and been following for a really really really long time, love you guys!
"A head full of fears, has no space for dreams" right before he jumps is iconic considering how scared he was. Great video as always
Man, why do all your videos make me cry?!?  This is such an awesome throwback to when I first started skydiving. The walk to the plane was horrid. When they opened the door I peed myself a little. When I pushed the plane away I felt completely carefree.
Yes theory the best❤
this video changed my life in a few minutes....    " in a life full of dreams its not space for fears "   i need a break, i need a new start, make me better now.
On a stressful day, in a new state, away from my family with a new job & expected to always perform.. (& also extremely afraid of heights)  this is the best video I could've watched today. That was beautiful.  Thank you guys for sharing
I absolutely love skydiving, and would love to learn to wingsuit someday. Thanks yes theory
Staffan is a great addition to the Yes Theory family, he has such a positive energy. This video was great and because of it I now have the courage to sky dive too. I usually do "If laugh I..." vídeos for my channel and sky diving has been on my mind since forever. 😅
Proud of you Steffan im not sure i could do it man just fucking Awesome!! Oh by the way....where the hell is HOLLY?????
You guys don't realise your spitting wisdom steffan "fear prevents life"  that is tattoo worthy!
Bros playing totk
“If you want to fly like an eagle, you can’t be surrounded by turkeys”
I live in Colombia but I am from Venezuela. This year I am seeking discomfort by doing a 90km hike and climb the Roraima Tepuy in Venezuela. I've never done anything remotely like this in my life. Also, just signed in to  headspace :)
If Staffan can do it, I must be able too also. This has finally convinced me that one day I will touch the clouds
Best channel on YouTube!!  A true gift to humanity.  Thank you, Yes Theory!
This is crazy, I don't think anyone can truly understand how emotional I got. Growing up in the region this was filmed in and getting to look at that landscape almost my whole life this went straight to my heart. I once went paragliding there and it really is one adventure I'll never forget. Seeing Staffan overcome his fear and having an amazing time is beautiful and inspiring. Plus The Mont-Blanc in the background I don't know why but tears rolled down my cheeks. Thank you everyone from Yes Theory, the Yes Fam. Thank you for inspiring millions of people. Merci beaucoup pour inspirer des millions de personnes.
Weird..... A few months ago while in NZ, some people from my group went to 20000ft and it was their 1st time.....
I have a insane fear of skydiving. This made me think I might be able to do this. What a beautiful gift you gave him.
A free skydive?! Dude…heights scare me so much, even airplanes feel a bit much at times. Incredible Staffan conquered this fear and faced it head on with so much strength and love. Inspiring🇸🇪
I really wish Staffan was more positive.  🤣🤣🤣
Isn't the concept of this channel making a choice to push yourself, like get out of your own comfort zone, not having someone else push you out lol...
Wow wow wow! Another amazing video or cinematic film I should say. 😊Always tears me up to see so many amazing people doing incredible things with true connections. 💙Needless to say my evening routine is going to start (or rather end) with Thomas on Headspace haha 👌
wow.... just wow
Years ago, I had my friend ask me if I wanted to go skydiving and even with my incredible fear of heights, it was because of Yes Theory and their beautiful videos that I said YES. It was the most amazing experience of my life: full of fear, but also of extreme wonderment and incredible confidence. This looks like an incredible experience and now I too am proud of Staffan because many short years ago, that was me. This video was amazing and now I hope I get to cross wingsuit flying/skyjumping off my bucket list as well! Congratulations Staffan for conquering your fears, never let them control you ever again! 😊
Would love to do something like this. My old man has never done it though and I'm starting to feel like he never will
Wear you god damn seatbelts!
I missed those kind of episodes with extreme discomfort. Real banger. Congrats to Steffan, what a man!
Loved that last quote...a head full of fears has so space for dreams...fear fogs my mind sometimes but i know i was not created to have a spirit of fear so i try to keep it in check
Hello Tomas, Ammar, Tommoy and Saffan! Greetings from Bangladesh, and my discomfort is skydiving (scared of heights).  I had a stuttering problem for almost twenty years, but Alhamdulillah, I overcame it. On July 16, I'm moving to LA, and I'm hoping to have a chance to meet all of you in person over there. I'm ready to fly like an eagle!  Once again Thanks for the awesome episode !
Who knew the best way to feel grounded is to fall from a high place? 😂
Why doesn’t Ammar have a helmet, when the guy he is attached to does?
Macedonia
This made me cry with joy and excitement for Staffan and how much courage he showed while overcoming his biggest fear. You inspire me and motivate me to continue to embrace and love the same mission as y’all’s. Seek discomfort means the world to me and has helped me overcome the small fears I struggle with on a daily like anxiety and depression.I would love to begin the seek discomfort package. I feel like it could be the push I need to overcome and begin my own personal healing journey.
Holy crape...Staffan....You DID it...xo  Bravo
"A head full of fears has no space for dreams" man, that's powerful.
New motto " If you want to fly like an eagle : you can't surround yourself with turkeys " - Tommy 😂😂
I felt Staffan his fear through the screen! It made me amazingly proud of seeing him succeed! 💙  O, and I'm happy that Thomas voice is on headspace now! He has the perfect voice for guided meditation and such 😁
"Fear stands for  : face everything and rise".  Had tears towards the end.. Such an incredible video as always, thank you for everything ! I can't even express my full gratitude for all the emotions and inspiring thoughts your videos make me feel and think.
Staffan was basically added to the team so he could be the one doing all the scary stuff 😜
I did a tandem jump once and it's a memory I'll always keep forever, I am saving up to do more lessons and hopefully do it solo one day 👏
i have no words for this episode...... you guys never fail to inspire and fill all those around you with joy. Each and every one of you have been blessed with such amazing gifts and to be using them collectively to the absolute most of your abilities is beyond inspiring.  i love you guys.   ----Richard----
I friggin' love Staffan's energy. "Fear doesn't prevent death, but it does prevent life". To be absolutely terrified and still go through with it - fighting his own mind, really seeking discomfort - that's what this entire thing is about. Such a perfect addition to the team.
I have gooosebumps!!
This video should win an award. Absolutely incredibly well produced and rarely do you see emotion captured so fully on film. WELL DONE YES THEORY!!!!
Hi guys, I started the seek discomfort package! I love doing new things and activities but I have to battle extreme anxiety, I think this opportunity will open up a lot of new paths. As allways, thank you for this amazing video, almost cried when Staffan got on the ground.
Heyyy I live in Geneva so cool to see you guys in my city <3
gosh your videos are so beautifully done, so sinematic. I cried a lot from how beautiful this was and how strong the friendship is
I am from Germany and have been following Yes Theory for several years now. The motto "Seek Discomfort" has motivated me this year, among other things, to quit my job. This job did not fulfill me at all and made me very unhappy. To go into this uncertainty was really not easy, but in the end it was the only right decision to give me enough space to find my true fulfillment. I will start with a trip of several months in South America, where many adventures await me and where I can step out of my comfort zone more often. I am ready to seek discomfort :)
I'm so proud of you !!!
yes theory,you’re so amazing!i think you shoud know how i love and respect your content,ideas! you’re so incredible.i am every day spend my time with your videos:)
Alright how much does it cost to do this? I'll gladly pay any price!
FLY STAFFAN FLY! I felt like this was finally his true initiation into being a full fledged Yes theory star 🤩
Literally getting my skydiving license and become a wingsuiter is my dream. Its the only thing ive wanted since i was a kid. Unfortunately its so expensive and costs 10s of thousands to get into. It sucks hearing people say conquer your dreams and do what makes you happy, when i cant :(
Most inspiring video ever
I'm actually crying!
A head full of fears has no room for dreams. well done guys, you give motivation to thousands of people to live their lives breaking thru what they think is possible and whats not.
Im from Norway and my discomfort is skydyving
Thank you Steffan for being that guy, you're awesome and crazy. Watching you skydive with your fear of height brought adrenaline rush in me haha, can't imagine how you did overcome that. Skydiving has been on my bucket list for a very long time, hope I'll fly soon like an eagle too... God bless the Yes family.
My eyes are leaking again.
Hey Guys!  Thanks for the free 60 day code, hopefully it"ll help with my anxiety. From the US, and my biggest discomfort is the fear of.. being alone. Im a socially anxious person and usually come off a little weird in conversations, and im even worse at small talk. I've been a "lone wolf" for the last decade, work and health problems, its fueled my anxiety and ruined my confidence. You guys are always so upbeat and are always able to talk to everyone you meet. I wish i could or knew how to do the same, but just never have been able to push myself to get out there and socialize.   Keep up the amazing adventures!  Peace and harmony to you all.
I started the Seek Discomfort Package on Headspace, however, I can't find your course on there right now 😬 greetings from Austria 😊🇦🇹
I had tears in my eyes watching this one. Well done
I started the seek discomfort package!!! You guys are amazing!
This video had me smilling from minute 1 till the end! I'm from South Africa and my biggest discomfort this year has been moving away from home for work, but its been a great experience so far! A skydive from you guys would absolutely make my entire year!!😭🙌
❤😢🎉❤
@yestheory you guys have made me try out something new and its slacklining, just the curiosity of fear is not a battle its a lovelanguage for the mind its drama that spark the consciousness, its beauty in fail attempts is the success of one experience🖖🏻👽
This is absolutely incredible. I've been wanting to go skydiving for the longest but the fear also stops me. But after seeing this and seeing Staffan, I just know I have to try it by the end of the year. Cant wait to check in with everyone here yo update that I did it. This promise goes out to you Staffan 🤙🏽🤝🏽
Seeing Staffan having this experience brought me to tears.. so proud of him 🤍 This year I'm focusing on my healing while seeking acceptance and fearlessness from myself.  I've already downloaded and started with your headspace collection and I am absolutely loving it! Love from Cyprus 💙
This video made me feel the most anxious I think I’ve felt watching something. To visibly see someone be so terrified and feel that with them is so insane. I cried, laughed, and got so many full body chills watching this episode! Love you guys so much!
Its sad to know that not everyone will get an opportunity like this from yes theory in their lifetime.
Wow amazing! I'm having tears in my eyes, this was so beautiful and emotional to watch. So proud of Staffan! I'm very afraid of heights myself, so this was so cool and inspiring to watch. I know these videos can mean so much to so many people, so keep doing what you guys are doing <3
I'm soooooo proud of you Steffan!
The headspace's page doesnt work when I try to create an account :(
Staffan - you're now officially initiated as a Yes-Theeory-ist! I've watched the 3 lads, Tommy and Cam be initiated into this crazy, inspiring, life affirming group, and now I've watched you take on the this most incredibly difficult task. The wonderful thing about this is you didn't do it alone, but others shared in your memory of feeling the fear and overcoming it. A head full of fears has no space for dreams...I can't wait to watch your continuing journey through seeking discomfort x  PS - amazing camerwork, editing and storytelling team - had me in tears...of joy and amazement of course!!!
Hello Seek Discomfort family! ☀️☀️ I cried my eyes out!! This was such a beautiful episode, Staffan!! I am extremely proud of you my friend! I have always dreamed of flying so high in the sky but have never done it. I will make it up there on one day!
Best episode 🤯🤯
Well. Now you HAVE to meet Nick Cage btw...
Staffan couldn’t be more perfect for this channel
This is Holy, Pure and simple
This is awesome 😎 watching from Kenya Africa 🎉
Ayeee wassupbruh
Omfg
20:35❤
I got second hand anxiety from just things being revealed to Stefan.
love the memes in between,, but the best video by far is Ammar taking the  Halo Jump, as in editor POV
early i guess
Right now I'm traveling through Kyrgyzstan on my own with my bike! I've never been in asia before and I've never traveled solo. It's the ultimate seeking discomfort for me because i like sitting around on my couch a bit too much. Well... I liked, I've sold all my stuff and right now my only belongings are in my backpack. I've pushed myself to the point of no return and to be honest I'm scared shitless so thank you for this reminder that I'm not doing it for nothing⚡❤️
I'm from the USA, but will be in Switzerland July to October.... signed up for the seek discomfort package :) Like Staffan, I am awfully afraid of heights and always have told myself I would never skydive.. every emotion he exhibited, I felt while watching this video for him. But, as ambitious in my own projects as I am, he is right, if you want to fly like an eagle you can't surround yourself with turkeys... good luck to all of the entrants, I would like to fly like an eagle and see what Staffan saw :) - Jonah
why am i tearing up when he runs and hugs you all :(
👏👏👏👏👏
I have about 10 jumps skydiving. I Was going for my A license but due to motocross my right shoulder is loose and when I flare or pull down on the toggles abruptly my right shoulder dislocates :(( it happened the last solo I did and I wasn’t able to flare at all when landing.
I'm from the Philippines and I'm an introvert. The discomfort I'm seeking is to face my fear of performing as a vocalist in front of a live audience (since im not a singer, but i love to play music)
This is literally my dream!! So happy for you Stephan!!!❤❤
The skydiving sequence is the most beautiful cinematography I've seen on YouTube. Combined with the emotional connection to you guys... Its a winner.
lesssgooo
plus im gonna be eating the snacks by the way. foodie all the way
The highest skydive was 128,100 feet. Nice try on the clickbait. Wow they actually changed the title because of my comment wow. Yes theory is all drama.
Going skydiving like that has long been a target high up on my bucketlist. I hope one day I can have the means to do it, god bless 🙏
fly high lol

This would be my ultimate discomfort. I get nervous just watching.
Hi! I am Dries from the Netherlands. I have just started using headspace to take some time for myself using meditation, and after seeing the faces and voices of YesTheory in the app I was immediately curious about the Seek Discomfort package. Today's meditation session, I am starting with the Seek Discomfort package. I am open to whatever it brings me! For me at this moment my greatest Seeking Discomfort experience is asking for help. I felt alone and misunderstood throughout the greater sum of my life, and since my mom passed away last year that feeling got stronger and stronger untill I even felt that I have abandoned myself in the process. A month ago I had an epiphany that it could not go like this any longer. I needed to pause my study and try to face the inner me again. Sitting there on the couch, meditating and focussing on only myself I felt a warm hug, like I was providing myself love for the first time in quite a while. This was the first time ever crying without thoughts with my body at ease and the warmth of getting a glimpse of who I am again.  Since then I started being gratefull to the things arround me again, enjoying life in the present and became more at ease everyday. This friday at the Project Iceman premier I felt the impact of my first week of meditation. I was so immersed (both emotionally and with my thoughts) into the documentary that I forgot the sense of being in a big room with dozens of people. Instead, I felt being imbraced my the energy of me, and everyone in the room whilst I was in some kind of deep meditation and conversation with myself. It was like my inner child got to the surface or I traveled down deep in my body to find that inner child. I have never felt anything like that before, and I am greatfull to have experienced that.  Even though life feels like the greatest test of all to me and is pushing me really hard, I am greatfull for all of the joy I can find, the people I meet and can help and for the moments that I can feel myself again and to get the sense of feeling alive.  "To ask for help doesn't mean you are giving up, it means that you refuse to give up."  Cheers, Dries
“A head full of fear has no space for dreams” YES Steffan! Your my inspiration ❤
You guys are something... Time and time again you guys keep finding new limits. It's such a big inspiration and i see I've still a lot to learn from you guys! Thank you so much for your videos and your giant community of like minded people. I love you, thank you for all these years⚡
so i used the code. i am actually in a bad place in life where i feel im going nowhere but i want to go somewhere. i kind of lost purpose in my life and honestly lost all my friendships. ive been really wanting to reset and move forward and maybe doing this with you beautiful souls i can regain myself. ive been watching you guys for so long and some videos really hit me in my heart because i truly want that unity of a friendship you all have. you guys are just so pure and always smile and i really wanna feel life again. plus maybe me and steffan can conquer heights together lol
Depuis que j’ai commencé a vous écouter, je ne peut pas arrêter. J’habite a Montréal et le fait que vous vous soyez rencontré ici et ai visité le Silo 5 accentue énormément mon appréciation.
Love, absolutely loved this
By fighting his fear and turning it into bliss... bravo. The pleasure he found is unreal. Bravo stephan... thank you for showing us how to dream!  At 45 I still haven't completed my dream of a skydive... but your strength has given me the boost I needed... it shall be done!
Staffan is fearless now! This video made me strangely emotional to watch him overcome his fear of heights and pump himself up with quotes and affirmations. To say fear has held me back from making decisions would be an understatement, but I’m ready for my own breakthrough. I’m in BC, Canada where there are so many outdoor activities I’ve never tried despite living here my whole life. If I did a bungee jump in Whistler, I think my soul would leave my body. Let’s see if it happens? 🥲
Nicholas Cage:🗿
Nah these people fearless hiking moutains, jumping out of planes. WHATS NEXT?????
The look on Staffan at 15:25, Its rare to see so much life going through a human just through their eyes and face, you can feel the experience and weight he's feeling just from looking at his face.
One fine day
Fastesr than the sexy times i have with my wife
That was a great video. Love you guys ❤
Great job Staffan! You are a true inspiration!
Love these kind of episodes! Last year did a tandem skydive because i wanted to seek discomfort and it was so amazing of the freedom of the fall and pushing trew the fears.This year i will do a AFF course the 30th of June (I am scared for it with a lot of doubt in my head.) But hey ‘’A head full of fears has no space for dreams’’
If I can be honest here. This made me cry because I too have a fear that I have not been able to get passed and because of this fear I have been a prisoner in my own home fo over 10 years. Maybe one day. Congrats Staffan.
SEEK DISCOMFORT !!!
Say yes to life. Romans 10:9-10🙏
I've started the Seek Discomfort package on Headspace.  I'm from the United States and my discomfort is the fear of heights. Just looking down from a tall building or literally anything that goes with heights I am terrified of. But that is exactly why I want to sky dive and try to let go of that fear! I would love to sky dive and is one of top things on my bucket list this year.
I'm battling a gigantic fear of public speaking. I only realized this a couple of weeks ago when my team won a competition and I was needed to pitch my team's project in front of a crowd of over a 100 people, including really successful businesspeople and I totally bombed the presentation. We could've won the whole event with our great demo we put a lot of hours into, yet because of my inability to speak, we couldn't. So yeah, that's my discomfort I'm currently battling with, thank you for giving me motivation to overcome this. Greetings from Finland 🇫🇮
Amazing experience.. 🎉
Awesome. Well done Staffan! You guys all rock
Best video yet had chillss. Steffan ur the G.O.A.T
Hello! I'm from Canada and my seeking discomfort is bunjee jumping!  My heart was racing so fast on y couch when I saw Staffan skydive. It would be surreal to experience that same feeling.
It looks very thrilling and exciting.
Yes theory i think you have lost the real reason of making this channel, i still like the videos but don't enjoy how i use to few years back.
I'm doing my first solo skydive next week. This is wonderful timing for the sensations and fears I have.
I just did my first skydive in my live and now you uploaded this Video. That‘s perfect timing.
Still saving for my solo license. 2023 is the year though baby🫶🏻I WILL BE CERTIFIED BEDORE 2024!!!!!
Omg how isnt anyone talking about the videographer who not only skydived but managed to shoot at the same time. Idk what they did to film this video but its absolutely mind blowing!
Got so much motivation from this video... THANK YOU (ps also started headspace thanks to your offer) Love you guys constantly making many lives better while having fun!
« If you want to fly like an eagle , you can’t be surrounded by turkeys »😂🤣.  So funny but so true!  Am grateful to all my family, friends, colleagues and all the positive persons I meet!
Let's go Staffan! Grym är du!
Please get Holly on you’re team she would be a great fit
skydiving was the most meditative experience I had.
This video was so emotional and inspirational! Bravo Staffan!
I Literally went tandem sky diving yesterday for the first time. It was Amazing!
WE CAN DO ANYTHING AS LONG AS WE SET OUR MINDS TO IT ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
If I’m not wrong the parachuting world record is nearly from the space boundaries, misleading title. Very cool video and big respect to you guys, especially Staffan :)
From the states and committing to what I really want out of my life rather than what others expect
We need seek discomfort to give the body modification world some representation. It'd be absolutely amazon to see some of the team do a suspension. Its something even the most hardcore tattooed and pierced people struggle with.
From the Philippines. Conquering my fear of heights this year starting with a bungy jump next month in Singapore.
nice I love you guys
I have started my Seek Discomfort Package - I'm not sure if someone like me can skydive - but I'm willing to try if you are :) To be fair, trying to meditate is also very much out of my comfort zone.  I'm ADHD and being still is NOT my forte...which is partly why I'm trying this Headspace App...go figure, eh? <3  - I'm in Canada
Hi Yes Theory, been your number 1 fan since then.
Hey Yes Theory, I love how your videos pushes people to go above and beyond what they imagine they could do. I really wish I could do the wingsuit jump Staffan did in this video but I guess you manage to organize things over the top so I'll wait for the right occasion to do something close And about the skydive jump, I'm already a skydiver so I'll let the chance to other people and reading the comments, I would love to see Honey David have this occasion Keep overcoming your fears!!
As a skydiver, I am so proud of him for facing his fears and pushing through that barrier. Skydiving absolutely changed my life. It made me a better person. Not a day goes by that I regret taking that first leap. I wish more people would go and do it. The most free a person can ever feel.
Beautiful
This made me cry, what a beautiful experience.
All you guys have total inspired me I  love you guys
Better change that title again if you want the video to blow
As someone with a massive fear of heights myself, this is so inspiring to watch. Huge Shoutout to Staffan for going through with it despite his fear, and also something you cannot underestimate is the huge impact positive support from your friends has on this! Very well done :)
Wow just wow !! This video was the definition of seek discomfort as Steffan mentioned he felt a buzz after. This ignites a fire inside of me to not let my fear of heights and others not to stop me!!! Steffan running into thier arms makes you think everything will actually be ok !! Thanks for sharing a very moving experience !!!
hey , I am from INDIA,  Thank you Guys for the video, this channel give me hope to travel and do adventure
WOW! Just WOW!
I always wanna do skydive but can't afford to do it. Look like i won't get a chance to experience the earth from the bird eye view 💔
Uno reverse!!!! Boom 😂
felt every second of that. amazing video, like always.
sheesh
id love to do this one day
Didn’t someone sky dive from space ?? Felix fella
You guys have so much fun 🙂 Maybe you could make some less fortunate happy. again..I know youve done it before... someone who struggles just to pay food and bills all day every day and never will afford to do something like you guys do.. maybe some one ill or in a wheel chair . Maybe you can provide food, pay for housing during a complete education with a good employment (on a work place connected to a union and good legal agreement regarding 4 weeks vacation 40 hr work weeks etc.). Guaranteed employment if studies are done and exam is taken  👍❤️
From Canada! Running my first Ultra Marathon
Damn i gotta get outta my room
The boys are back with their best explanations ever
Hey, you will be first guy doing this and you are afraid of heights and we need oxygen and we will do barrel roll and from helicopter and ...
My heart was racing so fast watching Staffan skydive from the comfort of my bed lol. I hope one day I can feel the adrenaline of skydiving myself! It seems therapeutic almost aha and a great way to seek discomfort :) Keep up the great videos y’all never disappoint 😊
Sorry guys for the delay, was busy suking… ooh i can sense the tension in the air. U guys shld def get a room, i’ll also jump in if u guys dont mind. ava’s mine but i’ll b dtf for u too deep. lets netflics and smash.
Heja Staffan!! Bra jobbat 👍🏻 Jag är också väldigt höjdrädd. Funderar på att bestiga ett berg i framtiden.
I'm watching from Bangladesh 🇧🇩 . I have the same discomfort. I have fear of heights.
You guys are mental.
What’s Matt up to? We miss him!!
I’d be so annoyed 💀
Wow, taking YouTube videos to another level, my man!
“Fear doesn’t prevent death. Fear prevents life.” - Staffan, 2023 ❤️
amazing plot i love it
What is this hazing lol
I don't even know, u guys were in my country ! I hope next time we can meet :D
Feels illegal to be this early.
Ayo nice video
Bro I thought that was Fortnite in the thumbnail I was like wtf😂
Hi guys! Loved seeing you IRL at the Project Iceman premiere in Amsterdam on Friday.❤. I used the code for Headspace. I'm living in The Netherlands at the moment and my discomfort is learning to swim this year. It might be a small discomfort for some, but I am terrified of letting go of "control" in water, so learning how to swim will mean diving into some discomfort in the beginning.
That was the best UNO reverse I’ve ever seen
I love you guys so much thank you for putting out such meaningful content it really helps with my mental health! I have been watching you guys for 7 years!
Watching this gives me motivation to do something outside my comfort zone. Edit: a day later and I went on a hike that's super tough, really high up and very steep drop offs. I conquered my fear of falling to death or falling in general. When I got to the peak it was 2,528 feet tall, about a 2,000 foot drop straight to ground on either direction on the peak of the mountain
this is terrifying. i love it.
Wow, I'm so early.
You guys are amazing!  It’s been 15 years since I had A dirtbike accident and became a paraplegic. After the fact I didn’t wanna do anything I just wanted to sit at home and be by myself.  you guys gave me the motivation to go out and try new things. I have the seat discomfort flag on my door so every time I walk out it reminds me to do something out of my comfort zone that day. And since this marks the 15th year I would love to go skydiving. It scared the mess out of me but I want to overcome that fear. If you guys were ever in Arkansas I would love to skydive with you guys. It would be a dream come true!!  Much love💜
Fantastic as usual!!
lets goooooooo!!!!! Love you guys <3

Hey eagles! <3 Staffan here :) I want to send my biggest love to Ammar, Thomas and Tommy for making me face my single biggest fear & holding the space along the journey. Love you guys! This moment transformed my life, and I will forever carry it as a compass and guiding light. That when fear hits hard, we can breathe and let it flow through our body and let miracles be born. I feel reborn after this jump!  I also want to say endless thanks for all your support since joining the team officially. You guys make me cry my eyes out of gratitude!! The world is feeling lonely, and for me the Yes Fam is an island of hope. Let’s keep changing the world together. Love you all! <3  Staffan
