I always come back to youuu:)
I love your videos
16:25
Can't watch these when I'm eating because of the fuvking burping every 5 seconds !!
the way she painted her future self
I know you might never read this Emma but when I lived in San Francisco the only alt milk I bought was Forager almond milk. It’s superior no weird added guar gums and it’s based in Oakland. Give it a try if you haven’t!
guys the last drawing she made lowkey looks like her at the met
Did you say « let’s have a pow wow » to have a meeting….?💀
What cooking videos do you watch???
Binge watching Emma April 2025. I love this girl.
Loser core video
16:31 she just drew herself in the future
It’s 2025 and Emma now has a CUNT ass pixie cut, and 4 years ago she’s like “I hate short hair on me” and it’s like…… just wait girl… future Emma is eating this Emma UP.
16:59 the way she kind of looks like that drawing now 😭
From 2025🤍
Love doing my mornings with you ❤️😍🫶
yeah
After Emma's deleted podcast 😮..she was dealing with heartbreak 💔
anyone here in 2025? miss this girl 🫶
haha
Forhead kiss to you Queen💓
It’s December 2024 and I’m here
EMMA why would you put in the MIDDLE of the video the freakin ALARM SOUND😭😭😭
Anyone come back to these videos when they're lonely or depressed?? Emma is my peak comfort YouTuber.
Who is here from 2024 just cuz they miss her ✨️✨️✨️✨️
emma is the definition of "you only got yourself"!
I’m rewatching some of these videos and they are sooo fricken hilarious. I love it. Emma you so hilarious.
I just missed her vlogs
Nice video emma!
she is literally the female version of michael scott I LOVE IT!!!
I come back to watch 5:50 after 3 years . I love it 😂💓
Will you marry
5:03 the reapplying of lip gloss after the mental breakdown story is so cunty fierce diva of ou
Emma every time I watch this video you set off my Alexa
❤
Colors  u see
It’s 2024 now and I’m rewatching this and I can’t believe I didn’t pick up her poor eating. She literally never ate a full meal and I didn’t realise until I went through this but for me it was because of poverty 😂. If I had her money I’d eat 6 healthy meals a day and never starve
I just looked up the “my dads kitchen” playlist and it made me feel OLD AF that she was listening to these as a child 😂
hi Emma! you are my comfort person I'm just smiling everytime i watch ur videos ur such a good vibes, love you!!!💗

Why this is fun to watch? Literally why 😂 l’m miserable 😂
💖
Emma i'm sick of rewatching your vlogs over and over for more than 20 times a month.. please help and vlog again
Love you ❤
Emma’s videos literally made me change my whole approach to my depressive and anxiety episodes. Where instead of wallowing in self hate or self pity, I just try to be my own best friend. I can poke fun at myself for being down but at the same time I force myself to do things that I would normally enjoy.
When her hair is messy asf  thats my vibe dude 😩😩❤️

I have been binge watching Emma all day and my dad is genuinely concerned.
She’s so good at the drums and so funny about it too haha lol 😂
Ik she talks about how much she crys but I just can’t see her crying
I am literally on the bed
I can see “everything go wrong ”by her hoodie
Bruh she keeps on burping all the time.Thats a lot of indigestion.
The way Emma cuts an avocado makes me nervous and worried about her well-being every single time
9:27
I’ve been like this since November I keep trying and i feel like a failure
My goal in my upcoming adult life: have the same life style as Emma
I love the idea of Goat sponsoring a video of Emma just talking about crippling depression.
Hi Emma ! I hope you're well :) I'm new here and just wondering, do you have adhd? Just curious <3 have a great day *forehead kiss*
Bro is she timothee 😭i love herrr
1:38
If anyone need to find activities to feel better during a meltdown I usually like to sing, bake something, learn a new lenguage, go out and buy face masks, creams, etc, take a bath, make Slime, learn sign Lenguage, try makeup hacks, etc.
you're cool
lol my alexa set a timer when she said 20 minutes on the clock
She is so comforting. And even though she says she does the same thing everyday, she always finds a way to make it amazing.
you'r the funniest Emm
Emma I just left Hannah's home.I watched Hannah's family christmas get togather.Where are you?MERRY CHRISTMAS my friend,love you.
after a period of activity, you have a period of rest. That is normal
She activated my alexa..

How I love Emma is she is real and honest.

Emma I’m genuinely scared that you are going to get food poisoning 😭😪
quit planning,, then nothing will go wrong, when you're planning something), when makeing a plan,) everybody will know about it,?, and they'll just know how to,,when where to disrupt your plan!,,😜
The fact that Emma could literally post of 20minute video of her just walking around her house and we would all still watch is all fascinating to me lol
I'm so happy I discovered Emma, She's so cute and cool at the same time. I love her videos/podcasts. It always make me feel good!!! She's a ray of sunshine 🥰🤍
I wish I had that ‘I don’t give a fuck attitude’ to cry whilst jogging. QUEEN ❤
We neeed more videos like these Emma plzz
In Denmark we never eat bacon for breakfast. We eat bread, fruits, oatmeal etc.
Imma lil bit concerned bcz i watch emma's video every Fuvking day. Like i can't remember the last time i passed a day without watching her videos. Is this just me?
the amount of time 10:05 makes me get out of bed and seasonal depression to take a shower is 🥺
🇺🇸
If I were Emma, I’d watch the security camera all night to see what animals walk by 😂
O my god. i can't stop watching your videos :)))) although you do the same shit in every video but it's really entertaining for some reason
emma 222
I know i will feel better after running errands, but all I want to do is lying in bed.
Shoutout to Emma’s dad who literally is giving Emma life again
Funny how it seems like she had a horrible time in between clips but the pace never stops being wholesome thorought the whole video
Your dad is kinda similar to mine cause he's an artist too and he is very kind and nice and we always have fun together like you do )
I love you
You’re literally my therapist ily
Hi Emma. I was moping all morning because I had to put my beloved best cat ever 20 year old cat to sleep yesterday and I was wondering how I can live without him but then I watched you this morning and I’m smiling and laughing because you are the best.  I’m 75, and thank you.

I’ve been watching this in between era of Emma for the entire day right before she started evolving right after the blonde moment
not grocery shopping until its an emergency is a level of relatability I have yet to achieve until Emma!

this is the most intresting boring vlog ive ever watched its so boring that i didnt even skip the sponsoring part where they talk about whoever sponsored their video the thing is i always skip that part but for some reason i didnt idk how the vlog is boring and i still watched it till the end where i got the forehead kiss i think its cause watching emma is comforting she could talk about avocados in an 1h video and id still watch it till the end. weird

BRO when you said "ALexA 20 MinutEs on the CloCK" my frickin alexa heard you
I feel happier watching this because at least I know I'm not the only person who gets so sad at times that I just cry and need to go for a walk to calm down. I feel like I've been so sad for so long that now it comes out as anger, but watching these videos make me so calm I wish I would watch these every time I need to relax.
I can’t tell you how many times I’ve watched this video.. (I feel like I’m watching reruns with all of her videos.. anyways) this is like.. my favorite video from her it’s SO funny and relatable. “Im not gonna brush my teeth tonight” *gets in car with huge bag and sunglasses* “No one’s talking to me today”  “Can you not stop in the !MIDDLE OF THE ROAD!”  “ALEXA! 20 minutes on the clock”  like please.. GIRL YOURE MY SOULMATE

Edward Bernays In the 1920s, Americans ate very light breakfasts, so public relations pioneer Edward Bernays persuaded doctors to promote bacon and eggs as a healthy breakfast in order to promote sales of bacon on behalf of Beech-Nut, a packaging company that had diversified into food production.May 24, 2017

How Bacon And Eggs Became the American Go To Breakfast:  Positioning eggs and bacon as breakfast was the result of a deliberate advertising campaign on behalf of a pork company. In the 1920s, the Beech-Nut Packing Company, hired Edward Bernays, a public relations and advertising expert, to increase consumer demand for bacon. To do so, Bernays asked his agency’s internal doctor if a heavier breakfast would more beneficial than a lighter one for the American public. But because the doctor knew that it was in his best interest to support Bernays suspicion, he confirmed the theory and wrote to 5,000 of his doctors friends asking them to confirm it as well. This ‘research’ of doctors encouraging Americans to eat a heavier breakfast – namely ‘Bacon and Eggs’ – was published in several major newspapers and magazines to great success. Beech-Nut’s profits increased rapidly and Americans now eat bacon and eggs for breakfast.  Fun fact: Before the 1920s, most people, at least in North America, ate oatmeal and porridge for breakfast.   source: theuijunkie.com , ur welcome emma

"In the 1920s, Americans ate very light breakfasts, so public relations pioneer Edward Bernays persuaded doctors to promote bacon and eggs as a healthy breakfast in order to promote sales of bacon on behalf of Beech-Nut, a packaging company that had diversified into food production." this is off google LOL

her cat in the back is such a mood
Thought I hated Emma, realised I actually think she’s awesome and I was just being edgy
“So I’m just thinking about the future of my soup.” That’s going to be my mantra from now on when I am down, cause it makes me laugh out loud.  I really need that right now. Thank you, Emma!
Andddd my Alexa set a 20 min timer...
My Alexa went off when she said that 😅
im litteraly watching this in my zoom clas lmaooo i love emma😅
Can’t believe Emma has « mental breakdowns » she seems so confident and positive. I watch her when I am sad and every single time she lifts my mood up. And I am like twice her age, crazy no?
I love hearing you play drums
I love you
when you asked Alexa to set a timer my Alexa heard and set one ahahah
is it just me or did she only swear like once GOALS
leave the animals alone. #GOVEGAN stop the murder, stop the torture, save the planet. Animals are not ours to experiment on, eat, wear, use for entertainment, or abuse in any other way.
“Am I gonna be in a bad mood today?”   Nah. I don’t ask myself that question. Rather; “who’s going to fucking piss me off today”.... 🙂
sad fact... Emma is like the lonely grandma that has like 1000000 cats [just kidding]
God I wish she'd stop belching like that.
Yes drummer Emma 🤘🏾
when emma said Alexa my alexa turned on and actually set a timer 😭😭
I love the forhead kisses like its literally the highlight of my day
Omg that little high-pitched "fAaCk" at 20:21 was hilarious but cute at the same time- wow Emma
Watching Emma, as comes on, it’s also Emma 🤣
I love u Emma
why do i feel like im learning to be an adult by watching emmas videos?
wow i just love u
DUDE YOU'RE SO HACKIN FUNNY ITS NOT EVEN FUNNY! you remind me of myself but your like waaaay cooler haha #KeepBeingYouBoo 😄🥰🙏
why's no one talking about why she has breakdowns frequently? like are we ignoring the reason?🤔
I love to watch her cats walk around while she is screaming like its their normal life :)))) <3
Anyone else put their forehead up to their phone when she gives a forehead kiss and immediately feel better? 🤣🥺
my crush on you just skyrocketed.  I love you *uhmhm* .... i didn't say that
why do you never swim in your pool
emma be setting my timer on my alexa 😅😂
3:50-4:20 i only watched the cat
Your cats in the back ground 😼
emma I will buy that mason jar drawing
i been wanted the shoes she got omggg
Breakfast food is literally propaganda, go eat some soup for breakfast no one can stop you
Yeah, Like The Drum Beat.
Does emma ever watch tv
Breakfast in Chile is bread with butter and tea 100% of the time
the add i got before your video started playing had you in it
ok but why is the goat website like glitching when I clicked her link.  man I really wanted those shoes
can we just appreciate this drumming masterpiece Emma has shared today? Like it's honestly therepudic!
Why is it always that instead of watching emma i watch her cats😥
EMMA, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT WHEN YOU PLAY THE DRUMS thank you for wholesome drum content
1:55 that’s what she said
Emma you should try shifting, highly recommend
—(EMMA , you have changed since you started drumming in your videos, around Christmas at DADS you started drum beats that are FIRE, love to see you do them, right now you have broke 10 million subs btw, hey, you are a cool drummer, I hope to see you in an all girl band , You have immense creativity in variable forms of energy, playing drums helps expend that bursting point energy. You are great before you start drumming, and even Greater after you start drumming, 7:25 a forehead kiss back to you 💋 )—
—(emma, rewatch your vids often , 6:45 was good for all the fans)—
I like how she just has all of her cameras set up on the TV casually right in the kitchen
seriously in love with this entire video 😂♥️
i love her
love
Emma is that a hickie.?  lol  :)
emma u made my alexa go off
Why does Emma remind me of That boy Chalamet 🤷‍♀️
Haha 😂😂 I absolutely friggin love you! Your sense of humour is fantastic. It’s 2.20pm in uk 🇬🇧 and lay in bed watching loads of your videos. Love the little drum clips too. Your an awesome person wish I knew you x
If 1600 people didn't like this vid, why not just move on???
I know Emma won’t see this, BUT since Emma brought up drawing, I’m telling you Emma if you don’t end up liking this idea it’s totally ok cause everyone’s different, but literally go on Pinterest and whatever you’re feeling photo wise, try recreating the painting you like and actually try to make it look the exact same. It sounds boring and just like “oh painting so fun 😐” but seriously I had horrible anxiety and health and everytime I spent time painting and listening to music and sometimes talking to myself it felt very calm and I would spend my time where I had nothing to do, sometimes even 7 hours, just peacefully painting and it made me feel very productive :) anyways hope you see this and try it out to see how you feel! ILY
she has so many posca pens... They're expensive as hell
im angry that i forgot to watch Emma's videos the moment she posts it. Emma, are you doing okay? The mental breakdowns you're having are veryyyy frequent. Please, talk to someone about this if you haven't already :)
Can't wait to hear an entire song on drums
Am I the only one that loves when Emma plays drums out of nowhere in the video if it makes sense lolz

Emma! Can you teach us how you make the coconut curry soup you were talking about??
Everyone’s alexas setting 20 minute timers...
Best.ending. EVER.
you should live in France
!!drum tip!! Emma you probably won’t see this but when you’re drumming to stop your shins hurting keep your foot pressed down on the pedal so the stick is resting on the bass drum, then just lift up your foot right before you want to hit it. This means you won’t be constantly lifting your foot and tensing your calf muscle so you can drum for longer without it getting tired 😎 also if you want to go mega wham on the bass drum you can get a second pedal to move your left foot from the hi hat pedal to that one when you want two beats close together :)
I don't wanna shower EITHER ok? stawp pressurin me miss girl
15;31 hickey?
The fact she always acts like herself is truly inspiring, even when she says she has no motivation and such she still pushes herself to do it, i love it lol
The burps>
I need to know where Emma got those black pants from.
“I’m still deciding whether or not I’m in a bad mood” the woman is in fact a Gemini sun y’all

Emma is one of the most honest youtubers and that’s all ima say
Literally nobody:.... Emma:Can you not stop In ThE mIdDlE oF ThE RoAD YoUr So StUpId.
The demonstration of the shoes gave me very: “hi my name is trey I got a basketball game tomorrow” vibes and I’m here for it
I haven't watched YouTube in years but I've binged watched her videos yesterday and I'm glad I did. I find it very comforting how she talks about her mental health, the way she doesn't want to do things sometimes and how she talks bout how she's feeling. It makes me want to better myself and do things to make my mental health better haha
Emma is my reason why I have a shopping addiction
idk if this is just me ; but I barley have mental breakdowns , once a month maybe or maybe never
“ i have cauliflower that i could cook in there... i also have indigestion.”   9:52

i’m concerned abt the cats on the counter 😶
emma being a indecisive gemini is so relatable
when emma was eating her burrito- i kept yelling at my screen saying “EMMA- DECLAN IS LITERALLY CRAWLING IN THE SINK.”
i actually paused and showered and did a face mask and came back thank you queen
Tom says hi
20:21 me when I miss an online quiz and my grade goes from A to D-
the avocado stare killed me lol
I really want to taste that soup, it looks delicious 😋
I'm confused. You eat eggs but everything else is vegan? Why not just get real cheese? Am I missing something here?

lockdowns need to end for this reason!! emma is not doing well, as are a lot of others. it’s very blatant, i wish it didn’t have to be like this
am I the only one who saw that hickey at 9:51 ???????
In the 1920s, Americans ate very light breakfasts, so public relations pioneer Edward Bernays persuaded doctors to promote bacon and eggs as a healthy breakfast in order to promote sales of bacon on behalf of Beech-Nut, a packaging company that had diversified into food production.
12:57 I thought she said “gOOoooOooOooOn” if you know you know 😏
*me scrolling at 4 AM seeing if anybody answered her bacon question*
Omg the story about how bacon became popularized as a breakfast food is crazy! At some point in like the mid 1900s pork became so cheap, pork industry lobbyists were scrambling to find ways to make money off of pork so they convinced major fast food chains and restaurants to start promoting it and basically it continued to spread and now it's everywhere. I read this article but there are many more online! - https://deadspin.com/you-like-bacon-because-they-told-you-to-1642981536
omfg when she said Alexa my Alexa went off and wouldn't stfu
heyyyyy
You remind me so much of Timothee and you kinda look like him too
My Alexa went off when you said, "Alexa, 20 minutes on the clock!" LMAO it's 10:26 PM and my parents are sleeping. I hope they don't kill me.
i love how comfortable emma is on her channel
Me actally taking a shower when you told me to-
I play drums and I want Emma to know that she is actually very advanced for a beginner drummer and she does a really good job
I JUST LOST IT ON THE AVOCADO MOMENT
I will not be satisfied with life until Emma is in a lesbian band
Cooking with sharp knife is fun but your under the age of 10 you don’t hear me say that lol 😂
Emma: Im relatable also Emma: You can get these shoes on this app im sponsored by (they are $420)
I would never order from GOAT why would you unless you're rich and can afford special drops... those sneakers youre wearing are $420LMAO
I love u too
the way i actually was like "ok fine" when she said to go take a shower. thank u emma
i literally love emma so much i don’t know what i’d do without her. thank you for always being here for us. we’re here for you too <3
You want to never be disappointed by avocados..... come to Zimbabwe 👌🏾 your avocado is the size of the seed
Emma you can't be talking with a face mask on. It will wrinkle your skin lol
u make me want to play drums
Not me rewinding the video every time she says forehead kiss 🙃😂
well now we know why you were so hungry
Emma setting my Alexa for 20 mins Lmao
I am christian and I really appreciate Emmas apology for saying Jesus name in vain instead of just cutting it out. like she actually released that it may offend other and some people don't release.
emma's like my favorite person every time i watch her videos i feel so happy inside
Who else's Alexa went off??
she really said powwow lmao
she called me out...i literally paused the video at 10:17 and took a shower
I died when you said ✨FÙuuuĶ✨💀💀

Today I went out of the house in 3 days of being in bed sad. Glad to be able to relate to Emma. — I’m now wondering if Emma has close people around her... Hhhmmmm
12:51 is literally me when I get mew shoes😂😂
WOW Emm makes me feel so safe... like my comfort/ security YouTuber idk how that makes me look but idc
I'm an art student and I wish I had the confidence and excitement of Emma when I draw something .....I'm jealous.
Emma you are so awesome for coming back to the video tbh I woulda just deleted it.

I'M ABOUT TO GET SWEATY AF!!!!!!!!!!!
IT'S 80 DEGREES AND I'M SWEATING, BUT I'M NOT WEARING ANYTHING UNDERNEATH THIS!
I don’t have a lot of friends but Emma’s video feels like she’s my best friend on face time
You should try and bake a cake from memory it could be fun to see how it ends up like no recipe and no list of ingredients
her cats in the background of her kitchen are amazing
I really like that Limbo sweatshirt
‘I hate being roommates with myself’  I felt that
EDWARD BERNAYS, Sigmund Freud's nephew pushed Bacon into Americans breakfast ! Look it up Emma haha :)
when she immediately took the rosemary back- 😂😂😂
Don’t touch cats. Or dogs. Touch up.

Idk but I’m 100% convinced this is timothee chalamet sister

red fleece goes crazy
Emma if I had your house, I'd be doing cartwheels everywhere.
Go to 20:21 and slow it down literally hilarious 😂
The homeless paul temporally slow because tablecloth inherently lighten barring a aboriginal coal. resolute, temporary talk
i love her.
hey, maybe not say: lets have a pow wow. it can be offensive to native americans
5:40 Reminded me of Sweater Weather lmao-
The wrathful comma worrisomely thank because soup aerobically grip astride a opposite dredger. puffy, obnoxious weight
The chaotic energy is everything.
This is the Emma I live for
the napoleon dynamite reference made my week and it’s monday
"lets shower together" umm Emma we don't even know each other like that
Emma could literally look crusty asf in her eyes and i'd be like "wow how is she so effortlessly cool why don't I look like that at my worst tf"
we need a house tour PLEASE
I feel like Emma shows wat being a influencer is really like, like not just the good parts and that’s it, but what they really have to go through, u kno? I respect her sm ahahah
I have the biggest fear of sharp knives because of trauma...u wonder why I can only make toast-
09:26 Emma has the mental stress of a 31 year old professional working 72 hours a week with 300k in student loans
"sorry i didn't mean to say his name in vain, that was rude" emma 😭😭
Where are your black sunglasses from? 🖤
why is emma the women version of Timothée Chalamet
“can we thin- Let’s have a powwow..let’s have a meeting”😭😭😭
I’m 10 so 😂
I’m a kid but your vlogs are nice
Why is it that every time I watch her I fell like we’re on a ft.
can someone tell me what lip thing she uses?
Listening to sweet and Loving songs makes me feel better
I love her cause i feel her so much i am just like this to and it feels good to me she keeps it real and she is a big youtuber she xan easly be a fake ass bitch coming on her like the shit we get from jeffree star or ace family and more but she just herself struggling everyday with herself like we do thank you for staying true to yourself
Hey emma! I have the same toaster/air fryer in chrome!
We need the recipe for the soup😭
Did Emma keep calling the microwave a toaster?? 😂
Emma please stop worrying about not doing anything with your life ,like what? I think you’re amazing you’re so successful, some of us are just spending their teenage years studying literally nothing else ,lol idk I hope that makes you feel better 😭
Like, legitimately you're the only youtuber that doesn't make me wanna hate my life . I don't know why is that , but you make me feel so good . It's like your my best friend!
“i kno what u little sickos want, u want a grocery haul”   me: *!!!!!*

when she said alexa mine heard her and set a timer for 20 minutes thanks emma <3
Emma: * Doesnt do anything with her long hair but put it in buns/ponytails *  Also Emma: I hate short Hair on me
I was thinking for one of your videos you should do an unedited one because after watching a video of yours I always want more content so what better way then having a whole like hour video of you lol
“The thing is think about how much YOU have them” well ok miss Chamberlain no need to attack my mental state like that
When could she play drums
miss girl those shoes haven’t even DROPPED YET
Emma I wanna live ur life so bad
more cat and soup content love it
I love how I can get on YouTube and see that Emma has been having the same day as me.. which is absolutely nothing and that makes me feel better ✨✨
Emma I love how honest you are with you’re feelings and mental health. I have 2 young boys and they want to get into YouTube which I support but they think the life style and how it is portrayed will come along with it. It’s confusing for young kids. But as an adult with 2 children I love you your personality. I struggle with mental breakdowns at least 5 times a day. I struggle to get up and to do the simple things. I also used to have an addiction to Opioids which I overcame.  Would love to hangout with you, you just seem so real. Huge supporter girl ❤️
the second day emma woke up and chose to be in a bad mood
20:57 again blur that tv😅
PLEASE WHAT DOES SHE EDIT WITH
15:29 I really think that the editor should've blured the security thingy behind her that shows all the parts of her house...and I just realised that if you a burglar i just gave you an idea...shiiii...😅
I thought I was the only Gemini going through the same shit
i laughed so hard  Emma ily and this is prob ur funniest vid change my mind
I don’t think you understand how much serotonin and comfort your videos give me 🥺❤️
The drum beat sounds like the beginning of smells like teen spirit
How does one go about adjusting into being more apart or apparent in part of someone with substantial mental break downs? Sorry hope it wasn't rude my grammer and questions probably make no sense. how to handle the knowledge granted to one from such brief events and what are some common pros and cons to a conversation? Thank you for info.
Am I the only one who skips through her intro??
14:43 she’s doing the most for us 💖
okay this is random af, but the Traditional Medicinal tea behind you is my foster moms company!!! haha
EMMA YOU SET A 20 MIN TIMER ON MY ALEXA
2:15:cat walking across the counter
Can you please react to the lady of heaven trailer? ❤️🙂
ur the most akward person and i love it 😌😂
I don't get why people complain about Emma having a breakdown on every episode, like she lives in a COVID hotspot and it ONLY became a hotspot because of braindead and shitty proclaiming influencers running amok on the streets who else would not get mentally exhausted living in that kind of area.
What’s your P.O. Box I want to send you something
Omg imagine calling toasters toasting machine... idk why just imagine
You literally set off my Alexa 🙃✨
did no one else notice the cat exploring the sink in the background
I have the same drying rack

emmas merch is the only merch i would actually be able to wear in public lol
MORE CATS MORE CATS MORE CATS
I wanna see a video with her just straight talking no editing
anybody else's Alexa set a timer for 20 mins after Emma said it
I LOVE when you drum!!!
I always feel like I’m on FaceTime w her when I watch her video😭
The cat...the cats...walking across the counter 😩 🐈

Exercise so good. For mental health. Try and get to a park as the greenery is also good for the brain
The demonic methane lily call because antelope clearly whisper through a useful jaw. wonderful, glamorous equipment

hi:))) how are you doing?? i posted my first video a bit ago and it would be awsome if you watch it!!! it's really short, basiclly just for you to be able to go down into the comments and vent if you need to:)) i also put in just some random questions you can answer!!! take care<3

we love hearing the drum progress sis!
“ Ok queen I know “

The love I acc have for Emma is unreal the respect I have like she’s probably one of the only celebrities genuinely would pay to meet
<3
emma is the only youtuber who isnt click bait
Every time Emma says she hates how she looks makes me sad because she’s so beautiful and so natural like I really love her without make then I do with like her eye bags and her gorgeous freckles
Where did she get her sketch book from ?
Her chaotic energy is giving me LIFE.
LAZY DAY LIKE ME.  lol

Thank you for setting my Alexa for 20 minutes 🤣🤣
Serious question, why use vegan cheese instead of regular cheese, is it better?
Had to pause because you comfort me so much. I have task I can do but it's literally like "UGHHHH" and you totally get that. Love you Emma xoxo

Emma 2021: “I’m fawking sweating my bawls off”
my mom has an airfryer
my sister was talking over you and she doesn’t even care🙄🥺🥺
this might be one of my favorite videos she ever made. the sheer honest truth of how we have all been feeling, as well as having to push forward. you're doing good em
I'm sorry but the "I touch my cats" gave me the wrong idea 😭
yes emma, we are sick of the drums
20:22 this just made my day
Go out in nature more.  <3
She is literally the definition of a Gemini
Lemme get a OWA OWA
I'm watching this right before online class starts just so I can get some of that amazing energy. Thank you Emmaaa
I literally cried so much today, Emma's videos always make me smile again and actually motivate me to do stuff :) xxx
man i love you
I wish I could explain the amount I relate to her
this video felt like I caught a friend at a bad time but she invited me and is insisting she’s fine and I can stay
If you have to think if you put deodorant on than you most likely didn’t.
i feel so good after updating my spotify. thank you emma
Emma you need to go on a SKI trip
I love the drum breaks 🤩💖
Okay BUT HER CEILINGS IN THE KITCHEN HIGH ASL
My Alexa setting a timer for 20 min
literally what she wears for pjs I wear on a daily.lmfaooo also I need to get a style besides leggings and a tee shirt lol
No one else noticing her security cameras behind her
emma: “there’s no where to go” *lives in california* me: sighs* while living in north carolina
do a house tour
Why does she remind me of a girl version of Timothée chalamet. All respect to the queen but yeah
emma is the only person that can get sponsored then go "you're going to have to wait one second" to the company and we all just accept it
Hahaha legend
does anyone know what her glasses she wears?
If you go back to the beginning when she was making food her cats where on the counter😂
Emma, you kind of look like Daphne Bridgerton.
forever peace in your life.
7:32 gave me a heart attack. I'm not supposed to hear that sound at 4pm, I'm freaking the fuck out.
I haven't seen Chalamet in while, so it's nice to see him again or her honestly I don't know anymore!
Do you think the accutane made your anxiety/depression worse? Bc sammme
4:07 yes
not me in a lazy mood;-;
Emma you are getting good with drums.  You are so beautiful omg 😳
@20:22!!!! "FAAACCCCCKKK" 😭😂😂
Pleassseee stop telling your non- existent alexa to do things its making all of mine go CRAZY
So if you keep up with the drums you can be my drummer <3
Emma please make shipping to South Africa availible. There's so many people this side who'd love to try your coffee!
my tortillas are molded
OMG MY CAT IS ALSO CALLED FRANKIE 😍😍😍
im so here for normalizing mental breakdowns
i feel like i’ve never had a mental breakdown lmao
I love me some Emma 😂 x
Emma can we see more Vlogs and cooking with Emma! 💕☺️
gurl why u so negativeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Emma, I love you. You make everybody feel good :D Thanks for the forehead kiss!
luv tempe (kinda veggie meat) ! 💙✨
Like I don’t know - she just gives me comfort. Like she’s so soothing. Makes me feel sane ngl. Like when I watch her vids , I actually feel like I’m hanging out with her -
Emma is just so candid- I really don't wanna do my skincare today. She does know she's a global ambassador of a skin care line 👁️👄👁️
k am I the only one who thinks that her drumsticks are upside down or sum?
Her face is so clear I’m so jealous
her podcasts are really useless no offense but why?
emma do u need a therapist?
Weird that I enjoy brunette emma more ?? Lol
Who thinks if Billie Eilish, Nikki Demar, or Gabbie Hanna had a kid together would create Emma Chamberlain. 👭👭👧😎🤔💁💯
I do my face mask during shower cus I’m lazy
Anyone else actually go to the shower, then finished the video like she told us to?
whos alexa went off at 21:31
We love you Emma *mew mew mew* forehead kiss!
I love the drumming !
6:02 “Am I a psychopath?”
The end was ✨aggressive ✨😂😂💗
it’s 7pm as I’m watching this, haven’t showered yet & have had a crappy day. so maybe I shall shower after watching this
You should make more videos with your friends!
hear me out...            merch with emma's drawing on it 🤩🤩
you should turn your drawings into stickers and add them to your merch or sell them
ur dads swag af for that
Vegan cheese does melt
10:14 I deadass paused the video and went to take a shower and have now returned to the video lmfao I love you emma ✨
Who remembers emma saying the same thing in one of her previous videos about how she doesnt like how they cut the cauliflower og
I love watching her videos makes me feel like we are on facetime makes me smile🥰
Anyone know where she got her sweatshirt?
Emma tells me to go shower, leave my bed and then come back:  Me: pauses the video and aggressively heads to the bathroom 😪
🖤
Take a month off Emma and go to drumming camp.
So you're gonna tell me nobody noticed how she can see all her security cameras on that screen in her kitchen ? This is so cool but it would kind of be scary if you see something/somone on it though (if you didn't see it you can see it at 3:29)
only ppl who do the same thing everyday can like this
emma you made my alexa start a 20 minute timer.
3:59 the cat is like 👁👁shhh am not here
It's so real that the next day after a mental breakdown is like "don't know what it was, let's get this party going"
I LOVE that U
it’s so true after a mental breakdown the next day is like “don’t know what that was let’s gets this party going” lmfaooo
I lost it at "SEE YA NEXT WEEK BITCH-"
*"is this store closed???"* *yes Emma, because we are STILL in a pandemic..*
In the changes, Emma must avoid using the warning sound that triggers me so bad.
I LOVE U
Such a good red fleece!!
Emma is like a chill teenager and a grandma at the same time like how I-
Emma gurll you're my spirit animal 😭❤️

I just LOVE how successful Emma is

THE AVOCADO PART KILLED ME😂☠️☠️

16:20  *me being a good artist*

That title is so me when the police catch me disemboweling orphans.
my mental health is at an all time low and watching this video is giving me happiness I love Emma so much
Love you Emma!!!
ok but someone tell me why when emma said alexa set 20 min clock my alexa said ok starting 20 minute timer... do y’all know how scary that was?!
Bruh those shoes are 600 dollars, they look sick but I-

Hey so IK Emma will never follow me on Tik Tok cause she is a queen but..... you can @pishongezehagn
👎🏼 sucks
ok but Patagonia fleeces are the comfiest things in the world
at 20:21 had me dying laughing
❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love your line and everything you are doing is soo amazing. I’m extremely proud of you you beautiful human being. I unfortunately miss Phil’s runs. Like can we just have one. Just one then we never have to go back. I swear last time. Then we can go thrifting. That’s it. I will never ask again.
Emma! GURL. I am very anxiety attack  prone!! If I am not doing something or if one little thing is wrong in my life I shut down and I can’t even do simple daily things.This usually leads to a depression of some sorts and can be very physically and emotionally draining. BUT something that’s helped and I’m being serious is not drinking caffeine anymore. Because I’m already anxious the caffeine just amplified it. I know coffee is your company and it’s something you love and comforts you. And you should do you girl. But in my best advice cutting caffeine and getting fresh air was life changing. 💞 I really do wish you the best.
I wanna know how she made her soup she should totally do a cook with me or something
fav video, love ya Emma!
i want to be best friends with emma so fucking much
these vibes are everything ❤️ love how things got brighter as the vid went along
You and Olivia Neil need to be friends
I don't know why but this video was noticeably more funny than normal
emmaaa i work for monat & we have a dry texturizing spray!! all natural ingredients!!!! leave a commentttt back if interested!!
Anybody else just watch Emma when they aren't going to good mentally
In the changes, Emma must avoid using the warning sound that triggers me so bad.
I rlly don’t get why she doesn’t like her hair short, she is literally one of the few people who look that good with short hair
taking the shower tip
In the changes, Emma must avoid using the warning sound that triggers me so bad.
emma i play drums and your actually better than i was after a year of learning lol your doing so well :)
Miss Chamberlain Living for Drum Breaks
Living for those drum breaks Miss Chamberlain
I’m late but.. even beautiful people like Emma get mental breakdowns
Okay is it just me or is that a hickey on emma neck at 15:31????
she is just my comfort youtuber. she is so real it makes me feel so good
Watching Emma's vids just makes me feel so comfortable
I'm 35 and I'm in Argentina in South America. So, there's no way of purchasing anything that she's showing, or do the things she does because I'm a grown-ass woman. WHY DO I RELATE SO MUCH? But, is it wrong though? Love you, Emma. Things stay the same, even when you're old like me.
like i know you're 18 or 19 but i swear wed be friends in a different life
yo emma. get a sewing machine and learn how to use it and revamp clothes
dude we use the same egg brand how cool is that
This is totally off topic but I have to say this    EMMA CHAMBERlIN IS NOT FREAKING UGLY! People are hating bc they are insecure think it’s cool or because she’s real! She does not deserve all this hate. She is a gorgeous human being and you don’t have to think she’s like- A model gorgeous but she is gorgeous not only on the inside and out but  she is gorgeous because she’s real honest and funny with her fans. I personally have never really watched Emma chamberlin but I saw on Instagram and tik tok all this hatefulness toward her and doesn’t deserve it. Thank you for reading it had to be said and if no one was going to say it I am.

Emma fake calling for her alexa triggered my actual alexa.

Imagine becoming the neighbor of Emma and hearing her interacting when she talks to herself
Until Emma is like 30 and her vids are going to be her lunch planning for her kids, I can only imagine she's still doing the forehead kiss.
Imagine being Emma's neighbor and seeing her talking like shes talking to herself

You always know when someone buys an air fryer because they always tell you. Also they do the same thing as a convection oven in which she has two XD Love you Emma
I look forward to your videos bc I always laugh and smile but also really feel the lows w you so I appreciate that you’re so open.  Thanks for existing Emma ily
I get to experience what it’s like to have emotionally available and supportive parents thru Emma n ok I know I can’t be the only one.
Does anyone think the sipping sound effects are funny?
hey bestie😘
idk why but your videos are just comforting to me. like watching full house lol
sorry for watching this so late!!!!
lol now i’m hungry. also in case anyone is wondering the best way to tell if an avocado is ready is to take take off the little knobby looking thing on the top and if it’s a good green color then it’s perfect
not u setting off my alexa
u made my alexa set a 20 min timer
The alarm made me shiver
Her face when the store was closed 💀
I was so stressed when she was touching her face after grabbing the groceries without disinfecting them😂
Does anyone know what yoga pants she wears
The cat on the sinkkkk the 🐈 ON THE SINK haha cute
Emma why are you literally the best like ily girl😘
Emma where did u get this hoodie?? Asking for a friend
This was honestly one of my favorite videos of hers. Like I felt like I was with her the whole time. Ugh love her.
I love the random drum cut scenes lol
literally my day and online classes
its the “let’s have a pow wow” for me 🙄 still love u tho
Hiii so Emma plz read this..... I just watched the video of you talking about how a guy made a video about all the prettiest girls I’ve ever seen (Ik I’m late) and how you were in it and all the comments said you were ugly I just wanted to say you are actually quite beautiful inside and out and whoever said those things maybe they’re just hating because they wish they were at least half as beautiful as you. But yea haters will be haters and umm if u need... I’ll be ur biggest motivator 😁 now I’m gonna watch the video ....
EMMA DO THE HANNAH MONTANA DRUMOFF as an intro it would b so cool PLSSS
I love this video and you❤️
your cat legit pooped or pissed in the sink. 1:46mins
i love that her cats just appear in the clips like just appear ... love that
I LOVE THE FOREHEAD KISSES❤❤
U should try black hair
I am so entertained with the cat in the background
Emma you really do help so many people to not feel alone when going through a hard time🌹 it’s really helpful to know that others struggle too - and your tips on how to deal with it are great, like following your gut and doing what you feel you need to do xx thank you :) xxxxxx
I learnt to play drums when I was like 8 or 9 but then stopped, I can do the 4x4beat but that’s it. Really love hearing you play drums.
The alarm transition made me have instant anxiety
I LOVE that U
Miss Chamberlain Living for Drum Breaks
her parents seem to deal with her mental health in such a healthy and caring way, it truly warms my heart <3
emma is the cutest i love her<3
Anyone else go have a shower when she told us to?
does anyone know where to find those big black glasses she has???
I can only imagine she's still doing the forehead kiss once Emma is like 30 and her vids are going to be her preparing lunch for her kids.
She is so comforting. She’s so honest about how she’s feeling and how it makes it hard to do anything, like shower or exercise. Makes me feel less alone and guilty :)
You shine a light on mental health struggles that makes me feel so much better about my own problems. Thank you for this 😍
Omg I love running errands
no joke this vid is literally me
Emma I actually got up and took a shower then came back and watched the rest of the video.
You should do a video of you getting ready and going to a pretty place and take Insta pics😂
Sometimes i literally feel like me and Emma are the same person
I don't know why I checked that playlist. now I think that I am her father..
We love u Emmaaaa 😼😼
anyone else genuinely pause and take a shower
Dear editor, please stop the alarm sound. I die and cringe every time I hear it, maybe any other sound made ever. Yours, a random ass bitch
But all went right after establishing you on yt,
He videos are so pointless. Don't get how anyone likes her. Just her complaining and acting like a moron
THAT DRUM BEAT WAS FIRE
im honestly concerned for you. im glad you have hobbies like drums to keep your mind at ease.
Does she not know how cool it would be if she posted more often
pls do another video with the 'now i can't make my soup' voice
Emma u need to stop using that alarm sound in the transitions it triggers me so bad
I literally feel like I’m in FaceTime with her
emma i love you and i hope you are doing good today <3
Emma....what drum set do you have??? Me likey
You getting boring
Can you do a video where you cook the soup?
When she tells Alexa to set a timer, but actually sets a timer on my Alexa
vegan cheese what the fuck what is the point like u might as well freeze mashed potatoes put chocolate syrup on it and call it ice cream
I looove quarantine emma vlogs
If I had your money I would SO get a professional drumming teacher, get good at drumming and join a band
we need a soup recipe bc that looks fire
So glad the brown hair is back
Who else is trying to figure out where that limbo sweatshirt is from
Is this a "quirky ADHD/manic" situation or is it for real bc if it's real, bless your heart!
She kinda look like timmy chalamet with dArk hair
i think emma’s channel will eventually become a cooking channel loll
Emma's dentist watching this: 👁👄👁
i feel so depressed and saddened these days because most vids i have watched lately r a bit toxic so then i realized “oh i should watch emma btw” ur literally the medicine
PLEASE DO A DAY IN THE LIFE OF UR CAT HAHAHAH

Fucking excited
20:20 lmao
WHO CARES?!?
I a 100% relate to emma its kinda sad but i too always look for smthing to get the day  over cause im fucking Bored  as fuck (eventhough i work 9/5)
When she started playing the drums my brain was like "AND ALL I AM IS A MAN I WANT THE WORLD IN MY HAAAANDS"
not me getting scared at 15:20 because of miss emma's reflection 🤠
Emma literally is genz personified and just voices thoughts that go through my head everyday, I never get bored watching her cause she feels so honest
Just wanted to say Emma your are beautiful inside and out! Xxx

gilmore girl vibes
emma's vids are so theraputic
my alexa went off when you said "alexa 20 mintues on the clock" LMAOO
17:34 that fit is iconic
You young lady, you got a big mind, and so powerful it is, at this age, you observe what people in their 30's and 40's doesn't make it. But you should care to know what you feeding your mind on daily basis, consciously or unconsciously. Mental breakdown and anxiety is the outcome of mismanagement between you and your hard wired mind. You should not only play Drum simply with Sticks, but also should observe what your mind reacting to it, what pattern it's setting for you, for the next ten minutes, does it feel good or bad? You as first person should do peace talk with your mind but like a third person, no biased simply honesty.
I will call you Jenna Marbles 2.0 :)
Thank you for showing all dimensions of mental health. Thank you
girl no offense I love u but have you thought about getting medicated? sounds like you got hella depression babes
20:22     22:00

WE NEVER GET TIRED OF YOUR DRUMS OKAYYY
Legit drew a face in Spanish today and it was great and then I watched this and I will try it again tomorrow cause maybe this is a thing
Wow imagine being depressed AND not rich. Guess I should start documenting my mental breakdowns 😒
You are literally so pretty omg! ❤️
Emma: this iss FFiiiIRReeRRr
I’ve never had a mental breakdown how is it ??
I want you to know that you helped my take a shower today  thank you because sometimes I won’t  take them for weeks and I feel like I’m not worth very much and I’m not pretty but you always make me feel better ps I think you’re gorgeous here’s a forehead kiss for you💋
Ur gonna have really well known famous royal quotes in the future
Patagonia fleeces were ugly until Emma wore it 😭😭
I’ve been here for a couple years but NEVER commented for some reason so now I want to be a real Emma fan so catch me in every other vid :)
That Dijon mustard with chunks in it and Dijon mustard without chunks had me going crazy 😂
Her parents seem to be coping with her mental health in such a safe and loving manner that it really warms my heart <3
Bruh, I'm never going to get sick of Emma playing her truthful fire on the drums.
I can just imagine once Emma is like 30 she’s still doing the forehead kiss and her vids will be her making lunch for her kids is that just me
Not sure if it was a good idea to show your security feed to the public
I try to figure out if I'm gonna be in a bad mood too lol
the alarm sound makes me immediately angry and raged with anxiety when i hear it lolll
Emma pls do another “24 hours without my phone”
You should make k-cups for your coffee!!! I want to try it so bad
Can u make this soup on the next cooking with Emma
I wanna try ur soup
pls running errands is literally so fun
Chicken tortilla soup for breakfast. Or Colombian food lmao
Ok but updating your Spotify playlists is so relaxing. Like seriously if you are having a bad day, it just makes you feel like you accomplished something. 10/10 recommend ✋😌
unpopular opinion: emma and james charles are the only ones in that "tiktok friendgroup" that deserve their platform and everything they have because they are the only ones who actually worked to have it
hahaha my Alexa picked up Emmas voice abt the timer
nas-tee hog ring in snout.
Ok queen- i know.
emma not knowing the main reason people use air fryers HAHAHAH
drop the curry soup recipe emma 🥺
21:30 thanks for the 20 minute timer you just set for me
You are my favourite human ever :)
can we just take a moment and appreciate how Emma can literally put on any item of clothing and look so good in it like whattttt!!!
PLS WHEN U SAID FUCK LIKE THAT I SHIT MY PANTS
hear me out...the drum beat sound like sweater weather
20:17
I love vlog❤️like me
When life hands you mediocre avocados, take a shower and play the drums
Keep drumming it up girl,   I love it❤️💜
Breakfast food is like Chinese food. It’s not good to eat regularly 🥴 Throwback to when I went to Mexico and they served hangover nachos for breakfast.
Me leaning in for the forehead kiss xD
1:18 ahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!! who else can relate
Love that you do forehead kisses!!! My grandma used to 💚
emma i just want u to know that i love watching u play the drums! ngl i want drums now cause of u 😌
DRUMMING CHANNEL PLEASE YES LMAO
people who do the same thing everyday rise up 😌
Oh Emma, I love you <3 Mental breakdowns and all, you are a whole mood.
your way making coffee(grinding and high waterpressure) is the best,but also harmfull. should consider to make filtered coffee with 100% arabic coffeebeans. also drink 2-3 times coffee a day instead the whole day assuming. sometimes i drink too much of it  and then having pshychotic thoughts... then drink alot of water and think on a happiest memory of your life so far. try to get a parttime job or volunteerwork,possible you meet some intersesting people.
First time on your channel. Your videos are a total MESS. what can I say? I LOVE ALL OF THEM
Emma: Get out of bed, take a break from the film, take a shower!
DUDE DON'T USE SINGLE-USE PLASTICS. YOUR BROCCOLI DOESN'T NEED A DRESS.
People who do the same thing grow up every day.
Emma you are a genius! Pesto and scrambled egg is sooo good 😍
Emma is literally the most subtle funniest person ever
Been wanting dunk lows for so long, they look better than imagined, So expensive tho
Why did I acc feel that forehead kiss x I feel so loved
Emma’s energy reminds me of Michel Scott
ngl as a barista watching emma talk while she let her shots of espresso die made me really upset LMAO
ily dude
I’m so happy how much the drums make you happy 🥺🦋 girl invest in more drum-happiness-related items
Give us that soup recipe! haha love youuuuu
EMMA YOU SET A 20 MINUTE TIMER ON MY ALEXA WITH THAT LMFAO
emmba the blue painting looks like balooney from phinease and ferv
Honestly, Emma and I would be such amazing friends, dear lord. Wanna lay in bed all day? Done. Wanna go bake something random? Say less. Wanna do skincare and makeup and make ourselves feel good? I’m down. As a fellow air sign, having things just up in the clouds can be kinda nice sometimes.
Feeling like majority of people who watch Emma's videos are 20 and younger??
i just love how in every video your cat is vibing in the backround
you are really fun
why does emma give me timothee chalamet vibes in the last part of this vlog...
emma just casually mentioning napoleon dynamite made my day :)  i love that movie <3
am i the only one that can’t stop looking at the cats in the background like-
No Emma we are not sick of your playing the drums bc it makes you happy and we Stan, also we Stan your dad what a fuckin man 💖❤️
Not sure if I want to be her or be her friend more 🤔
this girl cracks me the hell up
The avocados said "it's disco time"
Loving emma from burma 🇲🇲
👻 Boo!
Imagine being Emma's neighbor and seeing her talking like shes talking to herself
it’s so true after a mental breakdown the next day is like “don’t know what that was let’s gets this party going” lmfaooo
There isn’t the coffee company in the introooooooooo ahhhhhhhh
Emma❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
But I did hear you say that but it’s fine cuz it’s you and your amazing
Omg you playing the drums should be your introduction for your vids
i love you
but she's actually getting good at playing the drums..
1:32 res as an abbreviation for recipe is kinda cute
4:02 CAMERAS!!!!!!
me waiting for her to upload again even though she just did 3 days ago 🧍‍♂️
i wish she added more funny edits
Emma you should get some reusable bag for the fruit and vegs you get xx they save the planet and are super cute 🥰 my trick is to leave them in my grocerie bag that i keep in my car. So tou wont forget them when you need them. Big love ❤️❤️

I love Emma haha she makes me feel better as a human she's so relatable

emma should make a video playing sims
try these Filipino (philippines) breakfast.  1. Dipping the bread into hot coffee. 2. Taho (google it) It's a soya with sweetener and boba/tapioca pearls 3. Silog: Si= sinangag or fried rice + log= itlog or egg. Always paired with Tapa, Ham, Spam, Hotdogs, Smoked Fish, Corned Beef, and many more. Just look up vegan version recipes. 4. Champorado. It's a sweet chocolate rice porridge.  5. There's many more but these are what I think you can try there.
"touch my cats" 😂😂😂
IT LOOKS GROSS RIGHT NOW!
EVERYTHING WENT WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!
when she told us to pause and shower, i actually paused, showered and now i’m back
I usually love your videos but this one was boring asf and my head hurts now after hearing you complain for 22 min

All I want in life is a meal cooked by Emma 😌
Annoying, and gross af

You dead ass just set a 20 min timer on my Alexa 😂 that bitch hears EVERYTHING
hi
SEE YA NEXT WEEK B*TCHHH
Emma being insecure about not doing anything with her life when she has a thriving YouTube channel, podcast, coffee company, is creative director for a skincare line, is our BEST FRIEND!!! She is so many things and does so much. Emma, just chill. You’re doing too much for a teenager, girl!!!
You’re getting so good at the drums!!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Every video on Emma’s channel should really be titled “POV Emma Chamberlain is your best frand”
ok but like the alarm at 7:33 kind of really triggered me
Dave Grohl WHO
i want to try her soup so baldy
Emma likes praise just praise her drum skills xD
⚠️SERIOUS WARNING  Emma is getting prettier,more talented every single day now
that lil sped-up moment of you thinking had me dying
My Alexa literally set a 20 min timer when Emma said it 😂 I was like “no Alexa not you 😅”
i js rlly like the way she said “i’m sweatin’ my booWaLLs aWf”
She looks like Ann Frank 🤚
im glad im not the only one who cries and runs at the same time
I’m mad so I’m binge watching Emma’s videos
how could anyone hate Emma she is my literal guardian angel lol
EMMA YOU SET MY ALEXA WITH A 20 MINUTE TIMER IM UNSTANNING NOW
BRUH HOW DID SHE DO THAT VOICE AT 20:18 IM SO SCARED EMMA
Here's an idea: take your millions of dollars and do something fun !!! 😃😃😮😮😱😱👏👏😬😬
Just for future reference you don’t need to put olive oil in the air fryer 🤪
i wanna be best friends w her omg
anyone else’s alexa went off when she said that? 😐
emma where did you get the sunglasses
The EDIT thou 🔥10:57 - 10:59
why did i start crying even more when she said “goodnight sweetheart”
I literally wish we were best friends...like our personalities are pretty similar.
I'm not much of a breakfast person either!! I can't eat too early in the day. You are still such a queen, remember that. Ily
Emma you activated my Alexa lol
Watching her videos has me feeling like I’m hanging with another friend my age. Emma’s is actually my exact age and she’s extremely relatable ugh I really appreciate her anyone else??
I fuckin actually paused and took a shower 🤷🏼‍♀️ she said I did.
She's evolving 👏🏼👏🏼🥳 buying fresh broccoli and cauliflower instead of pre packaged!!
can you like do a video where you show us how you make the soup?
Love how your videos are edited like the Scott Pilgrim movie, you are genuinely funny and ily
Who else thinks Emma looks like shroud?

I LOVE YOU TOOOOOO
LOVE IT!
emma is literally my comfort youtuber
Our ancestors have been eating pigs for thousands of years.
"idk if im in a bad mood" or all of them just bug me.
In a few years, I just imagine Emma would leave her YouTube career and start a girl band and be a drummer.
I rlly don’t get why she doesn’t like her hair short, she is literally one of the few people who look that good with short hair
Put your tortillas in the fridge, that might help a bit?
where can we get that curry soup recipe.....
Emma please where is that limbo sweatshirt from
Um did anybody notice that when she was talking about goat her cat was just staring at her like, "Um dis girl is weird..."
ahhh WHEN U SAID BORDER COLLIE 🥰🥰🥰🥰
4 words. Dry shampoo saves lives (diaries of a messy hair gal)
Its so cool
How are you so good at drums
“CAN we get the lighting right Jesus Christ 🤣”
EMMA, hopefully you see this! You should definitely learn the drum part of “All Apologies” by Nirvana and then play with the song when you learn it 🥺😍
Is she still dating Tucker aka Role Model????
Soup recipe pls
I WANT THAT GREETINGS FROM LIMBO HOODIE
good there is truly no one else i'd rather be friends with also emma i play electric guitar so we can make a band too
okay, relatable as hell. thank you emma🤍
so no one is talking about the air fryer toaster?
Your drum breaks are everything
you can make vegan brigadeiro with the coconut milk haha
plz plz plz do a video taking your besties thrift shopping and picking out outfits for them :)))))))))))))))))))))
....3 mins in but we have the same toaster oven
Hahah it would be nice to have parents who actually try to help your mental health instead of just saying “I’m sorry” oof
Every video: I dO ThE SaME tHInG EvEryDaY
Did anybody else put their forehead to the screen
Get rice and mix the curry and the rice! So yummy
That awkward moment when my Alexa sets a 20 minute timer when you said Alexa said a timer 😭😭
Soup recipe please
House tour?
Lowkey, your avacado is fire emma
You need to eat sugar.  Helps stay in good mood.
I record videos JUST like this but no one sees them cause I don’t have a platform and will get bullied
I literally have mental breakdowns for the whole day like it lasts a few days I cut off all my friends sooo hahahah
In a few years, I just imagine Emma would leave her YouTube career and start a girl band and be a drummer.
At certain points it looks like you have those little plastic baby hands but you don’t. It’s kinda cute tho!
the drum breaks are everything please don't stop doing them
Air frier toaster oven
does anyone know what toaster oven / air fryer this is bc I need it. tysm <3
That drum beat is the intro to 'Gimme All Your Lovin' by ZZTop.
drinking milk straight out of the container not only makes it unsanitary but it also makes the milk go bad REAL QUICK. better to just drink it with a glass
She said Frankie so cuteeee 16:11
This is what we praise.
monday i decided to have a bad day and then a got a crack in my windshield on the way to work..
Watching Emma while high is something else
hey emma, first of all i just wanted to say that i love your videos!  and u should try to get into witchcraft its really fun :3 like crystals and spells and stuff :))
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzYmT9KMj0A&t=9s
understandable
i love you emma thank you for keeping me company while i painted
I lost my job 2 weeks ago because of covid, I had a cry about that and then was in a bad mood.
I love u Emma u always make my day ❤️😭
YOU MADE MY ALEXA SET A TIMER XD
Not my Alexa starting a timer for 20 minutes after u said that 💀
i don't know who needs to hear this but an air frying is a small, compact convection oven....so in other words, an oven
You made my Alexa set a timer for 20 minutes LMAO
Her: my tortilla is moldy me : there is a speck of dirt on my tortilla
Play guitar yo, drums is kinda bruh than guitar ya know
dude i was literally talking about how sometimes bacon is in every meal of the day so how is It only a breakfast food ???? that’s fucking weird i just watched this too
YOUR DRUM PLAYING IS FIRE!!! IT'S LIT!!!
i want a house tour sooo bad
i want to be her best friend so badddddd......she is soo funny i'm dying lmao.x
Send me your cat drawing
Did she set off anyone else’s Alexa with that timer? 😹😹
“people were walking their dogs and seeing me cry... but it was beautiful.” love u emma
she keeps saying she wishes she had an alexa to say shit too, but doesn't she have a phone with siri?? yell at siri.
The drawing was so gooddd🥲🥲🥲
for your new merch, did you give royalties to the original artist? I feel like it should’ve been a collaboration because unfortunately creatives often don’t get paid for their work
18:15 I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO SAID HURTED
Dude i would literally look like shit with your haircut. You're reaalllyy pulling it off.❤
emma.... are you okay lol
i dont wanna brush my teeth today
just an observation
also i don’t think anyone brushes they’re teeth everyday
YESSSSS EMMA OMFGGGG IM LIVING FOR YOU LEARNING THESE BEATS
COULD YOU IMAGINE SEEING EMMA IN PUBLIC
Hey Emma 💚🍀💚 I love you and your videos but just wanted to let you know when shopping for vegetables it’s more environmentally friendly to opt to not using plastic over one item of food, I would suggest maybe using paper bag or even a reusable bag to put them all in xxx
I did enjoy watching the cats eat and next time a longer clip of them would be appreciated thank you😂😂😂
I thought the cat was cute
why did the alarm sound from the next day trigger mee so much😭😭💁🏽‍♀️✨
okay... so I want to see Emma do one of those paint by numbers from amazon. there really fun to pass time in lockdown and its fun to make something beautiful when were all feeling so shit!1 aha. Love you Emma!
5:16 I CANT BREATHEEEE
come to england you will find avercardo here
Can i just say that the iphone alarm sound is triggering 😆
Emma please do a drumming video. Just straight drumming
THAT IS THE BEST TOASTER
the only influencer that is quarantining😌😌
I'm pausing the video and going for a shower ;p
The drums🥺
10:36   Virality has the same energy as frictionless
Emma love the art! So cute
Tip. Be positivity. Each day be thankful for your largess
everything about this was so relatable, thank you and let’s get through this together
I rlly don’t get why she doesn’t like her hair short, she is literally one of the few people who look that good with short hair
you should make a charcuterie board for your cat
Drop the soup recipe
I wish you could brush your hair gently 🤭🥺💙!
hi emma
hey Emma love you but can we refrain from using the word powwow when talking about a meeting and not an indigenous gathering? and ur not cancelled lol I'm just tryna bring awareness to this.
Great video
the alarm sound made me sad
emma is a cat
try slicing the tempe thinly and deep frying it. Its such a good snack that way
hey emma just wanted to let u know i love the dumb playing in the vlogs
is nobody gonna talk about how she says 'cauliflower' weird? lol
Your dad is so cute!!! And I feel like we’re the same person!!!!! 🥰
I SAW THE PLAYLIST NAMES I love em
you're so close to 10 mil, big love
Emma you should sell your art
Answer to 9:25  Buy an xbox add me we can play fort
i rarely cry. i dont know why maybe because i have emotionally absent parents but at 6:44 when emma said goodnight sweetheart i genuinely cried and i keep replaying that part and it makes me sad but also feel warm and cared about at the same time because that is the first time someone has called me sweetheart :)
you are my spirit animal
do bestfriend tag with olivia
you cat was on the kitchen counter lol
i need the recipe for the soup pleaseee
EmMA!?!!!!!!! u are so funnnnnnyyyy😂❤️ I wish I was as funny as u
American breakfast food started being very different from everyone in the world with marketing. So basically a company who sold bacon was like hey we need a campaign to sell more of this. And then they created ads with eggs and bacon and I guess it was pretty influential. This is not an academic description so don’t come for me on this lol. I had one of my marketing professors tell my class about it, so it feels pretty legit.
can you not return things via a supermarket or collection point in USA........ we can in UK
The thumbnail is so Emma😭😂
can we please incorporate these random accents into every video??? i love them
“Emma can you stop having those” 🤣
drop the soup recipe pls
At some point I realized having certain foods only for certain meals is actually just a silly made up thing. So I abandoned that cultural norm and eat whatever I want at whatever meal it happens to be. I'm eating Chinese food for breakfast right now. It's amazing.
When the forehead kisses are the only form of comfort atm
the way she says cauliflower angers me i love her but ugh
The way she set the timer on my Alexa
Yummy burnt broccoli
honestly made me laugh out loud so much xxx
who else heard the Grammarly commercial and knew it by heart.
Emma queen of dressing
<3 thank you for talking about your breakdowns. I feel you <3
In the 1920s, Americans ate very light breakfasts, so public relations pioneer Edward Bernays persuaded doctors to promote bacon and eggs as a healthy breakfast in order to promote sales of bacon on behalf of Beech-Nut, a packaging company that had diversified into food production.
youre doing great emma
Kids brush your teeth. You are only teething twice 😂
She is so comforting. She’s so honest about how she’s feeling and how it makes it hard to do anything, like shower or exercise. Makes me feel less alone and guilty :)
Was thinking. Turn the drum set.   Around. To face the room. You mite get inspired.   Maybe give up a concert. 10 minutes of beats.    It would be nice.  Facing the corner. Remind me.   Being punish, i was young.
Jesus Christ will return very soon. Please put your faith in him, and what he did on the cross. We, as humans, live in a sinful nature. We are sinners, but the good news is that Jesus Christ sacrificed himself so that our sins could be forgiven. The Gospel is 1 Corinthians 15:1-4. Christ died for our sins, and on the third day, he rose from the dead, and ascended into heaven. Jesus loves and accepts everyone. It does not matter who you are or where you come from. He loves you, all you have to do is accept the GIFT that he provided for us. It's a gift that we do not earn ourselves. Not works, but through faith. Please get saved today.  Have a great day and remember that Jesus loves you; it does not matter who you are, he loves you. Maybe to help lift up someone else's day, you could spread this positive message around! Have a nice day!
EMMA PLEASE COME TO IRELAND
Not that seeing you have a shitty day makes me happy, but i’ve been having some shitty days lately and you have genuinely made me feel not so alone so thanks 😘♥️
Finally, somethin from my country. HAIL, TEMPE!
emma: talking about her burito and how she wants to eat other food for breakfast   the cat in the back: deciding weather to hop into the sink or not
that alarm sound TRIGGERED me
Ok but when’s she dropping the soup recipe
the in the background tv showing the security cameras is kind of unsettling lol
u should do a video online shopping emma
the 'fuck' you said while playing the new drum beat took the whole beat to another lvl
I cannot be the only one who puts their forehead on the screen for the forehead kisses... and if i am, that is perfectly fine :))
Lol when she said “u didn’t even hear me “
vlogging must feel like astrolprojection
do you even know what a powwow is?
i made some curry w brisket and avocado this morning lol
What i learnt from watching emma is, people will normally have mental breakdown because i never had those 😅 like i cry if something makes me sad but it usually because of certain event happened 😅
Emma lets craft something next week
20:19
Thanks for making my horrible day better!
keep doing the kisses every time u do it i cry tears of joy- i feel so loved even if u don't know i existtt
girl i literally adore her so much
I've been in a massive depressive funk and go like a week without showering and just want to lay in bed and eat xanax. Fuccccckkk life sucks and I cant get out of this.....help
I’m so jealous that your job is just living your day to day life and having mental breakdowns and stuff. I don’t even have the time to have a mental breakdown lol I always gotta work the next day!
I don’t get how people could dislike her videos. She is so entertaining like.
This is the best video I have seen in a very very long time
Emma eating vegan sausage then cracking a whole egg onto it is a mood
The alarm sound gave me anxiety lol
Okay but I NEED a day in my life of Frankie and Declan
Hey Emma, just a quick tip (I'm not sure if you know this cause your kinda new to the cooking scence): make sure to leave any hot food out to cool before putting it in the fridge. Just put it in a container and cover it, then come back later when its cooler.
7:33. That sound. I almost had a heart attack. Almost cried
It took me like 8 minutes in to realised that she was blond few videos ago
emma i see that in your neck
my alexa started the timer too lol
i literally eat whatever food I’m craving at anytime of the day and when people make fun of me bc it’s “breakfast time” but I’m eating chicken nuggets or some shit i always asked who determined why specific foods are for specific times of the day. and bring up the fact that if that was the only food you had is it going to stop you from eating it because it’s “breakfast time”¿
Hey you should put tape or something over your Apple computer camera
K but lets talk about how unproblematic Emma is
i lost it when frankie was just in front of the camera and u just see fluff
why does her oven have a sticker on it that says cat
wait why was this vlog so good? i’m actually so proud.
"My tortillas are mouldy" 😂
I love how Emma says sweated even though that’s not the correct term😂😂 Emma’s a wild spirit
you are the literal queen of vlogging!! I remember the old vlogs! those were GENIUS!
nobody:  literally nobody : : my mom wondering why im laughing at 4 am
I really think you should try watching anime. It’s a really great way to past time and have a good time. I recommend attack on titan if you like action. Nana if you like romance. Or you can try watching some studio ghilbli movies!
You set my alexa for a 20 minute timer
WE NEEEED EMMAS DRUM MERCH LOL
emma: *has 3 breakdowns in one day* *lays in bed all day* *doesnt cook anything* *burns her oven broccoli* also emma: THAT DRUM BEAT WAS KINDA FIRE THO
This one was really funny. Emma I hope you are doing ok and please rest assured in the fact that you’re a funny gal. Love u *forehead kiss*
🧁
those drum breaks are giving me serotonin
I'm sorry for laughing with the J.C joke HAHAHAHAH i love you emma
@6:12 😭😂
Yo Emma ily dude, so much. Pls pls pls can we change using "powwow" when we mean huddle or to confer? I know it's never your goal/intention to be offensive, so I think it would be super dope to make that adjustment. Maybe folks could even reply to this with other alternatives. Here's some info if you're wanting more context :)  https://www.insider.com/native-american-offensive-racist-things-2020-1#:~:text=Referring%20to%20%22powwows%22%20and%20%22,can%20be%20seen%20as%20offensive.
PLS POWWOW
I JUST HAD TO CANCEL THE TIMER CUZ MY ALEXA HEARD EMMA LOUD AND CLEAR BUT DOESNT WANNA HEAR ME WHEN I WANT THE LIGHTS ON LOL
EMMA I LIVE FOR THESE VLOGS PLS NEVER STOP

i love you emma you're amazinbf
20:21
Ok but when are you gonna drop that soup recipe ma’am?!
this is the Emma I missed
my dad is a drummer and loves your drum breaks haha!!!
I just listened to the “my dads kitchen playlist on Spotify” did I cry? A little
girlie vegan cheese does melt!!! pls god its so awful when its not melted dont do that to urself queen

Emma can you make a recipe book?
please look up the meaning of powwow and educate yourself, not good to use it in that context
i love her
i was showering while watching this lol
4:23 - Sounds oddly familiar 🥴🥴🥴
Loved the video 😂❤️🥺 reminded me of the old vlogs but better lol
Omg did anyone else get her chamberlain coffee commercial when she was blonde?
i actually needed to take a shower thank you
Do covers, pleaaaaase
play your drums queen i love it
emma reminds me of my guitar teacher
i audibly laughed when u said goodnight sweetheart lol
I freaking LOVE your vlogs. They brighten my day
you didn't have a mental breakdown because you'd be in the hospital or in a much worse condition then you show. you had a cry
I love her so much
I had a mental breakdown today and could really relate to feeling the pressure of unproductivity and failure, so I really appreciate the authenticity, because I was feeling pretty lost and alone. Love ya lots girl, you’re amazing❤️
is this a cry for help
emma vlogs make me happy
My bf told me a while back that when drumming you have to hit the foot peddle with your heel. Something about less strain on your shin and it being more controlled.
You should try and get Matt Garstka to help you learn drums. He lives in Cali and is one of the best drummers alive.
VEGETARIAN EAT EGGS???????!!!!!!!!!!!
your videos comfort me because your brain and my brain go at the same speed
the second drawing of a person looked like balooney
can we get a soup recipe check tho???
I feel so honored to have the same toaster as her
you triggered my Alexa when saying that
Love her but it makes me feel physically sick that she feeds her cats on her kitchen worktop and that they just walk all over it...... #littertrayfeet 😋
try therapy?
I think she has indigestion
did she just say powwow
the echoes when she laughs makes me laugh
Love the drums, it's great to get into new things
Go to the beach or go on a hike or go for a drive along the coast
Put your torts in the fridge. 7:20 that laugh ugh is so pretty. haha when I laugh it's loud. Drive to Provo Utah and check out the downtown at night. It's pretty like you. :)
Omg the rosemary had me HOWLING 🤣🤣🤣
The Pink Wall made an appearance
❗❗❗PLEASE LIKE SO EMMA CAN SEE THIS!!!❗❗❗ Emma, this took me like 3 days but I was thinking of things you could do for vids so here u go: try tik tok trends/dances, try different styles (indie, grunge, etc.) DIY stuff (clothes, decor, etc.),  prank calls, redecorate a room in ur house, organize ur closet, storytime vids, buy stuff u don't need, paint something, draw something, DRESS YOUR CATS, and yeah! I hope you see this and get some ideas! Have a good day!
I can do relate to deciding If you’re in a bad mood or not hahah
This video is giving me major Gemini vibes
Have you gone to a fashion show recently
anyone else's Alexa go off when she said to seta 20 minute timer!?
Broccoli and Cauliflower is like mom and dad
When she said His name in vain, i got shocked but then she apologized aww that's our emma 🥺🥺🥺 Some YouTubers/influencers just shouts His name whenever they want to. its disgusting
so we turn 20 on May 22 this year. are you also terrified or are you normal
usually little babies grow up and stop being so silly, that's okay, if it's the way to make life worth living..
i acc love cooking with sharp knifes too lmao, but due to...personal reasons, i cannot... we love to see it =)
you are literally the funniest person 🤣🤣
Bruh Frankie wanted attention 😂
5:54 and that’s on the release of ✨dopamine✨
4:01 At school I was such an attention seeker and I’d wake up and decided I was gonna be mad the whole day to see people’s reactions and I end up laughing first period 😂😭
this inspired me to shower thank u
okay here me out, learn sweater weather on drums.
oh my god IM YOUR BIGGEST FAN
I love you Miss Chamberlain!!
Hahahah i love you you always make me laugh and make my day better 💕
the fact that she says she didn’t brush her teeth never related to something so much 😂
This is my favorite vlog EVER
Thank u for all the forhead kisses
I just want you to know I’m a grown ass 21(almost 22) year old man and I’ve been having a horrible day I was on the verge of breaking down but you got me to laugh for the first time all day and it’s 8pm. Thank you ❤️
where did u get ur sweatshirt from I luv
Emma playing the same beat in every video is cute
me making an at home iced coffee while watching emmas video
everytime she says alexa she turns my alexa on
i was about to beak you for using that pre-cut bullshit again... and then i saw a whole friggen head of cauliflower up in that bitch. i'm elated
im stilllll waiting for a house tour eagerly
I love how ur cats get up on the most random things
My life is just like yours emma.. but yours is a bit more interesting 😭😭. I love you 💞💓
This is how many people support Emma ↓
Emma you should try smoking weed. Helps to lighten dark times and wastes time, but like... in a good way ?
idk why but watching people go about their day and run errands are some of my favourite things to watch
Manic or what haha
Low-key she makes u feel like ur their 😂😂❤️
The fact I was just on goat before clicking on this video. But ended up buying my shoes off of stockx😪
I can't tell if Emma and I have a lot in common or I've been watching her content so long that I've just become her?
When Emma told me to pause the video & take a shower, I literally did. I feel so good now :)
God bless you Emma, Jesus love you!
is it me but u could watch Emma do nothing all day..🙂
Your so pretty and you have rlly beautiful eyes 👌
YAY
This made my day so much better
Y do I feel like Emma needs a pixie cut? Like if u agree
will you ever ship your merch to the UK?:(
idk if it was just me.. probably not but I found this video so funny.. great job Emma!!
Emma’s lucky it seems like she has no responsibilities to do an a day
You should do a full video trying different foods in your air fryer!!!!
that forehead kiss made me feel so loved🥺
if u put ur tortillas in the freezer they stay fresh !!
4:10 deckland is so cute i think i spelled his name wrong lol
I think she’s depressed
she’s so cute when she’s talking about how much she loves drums ☝️😭
Things to do:  Color,  paint,  shower stories storytime some kind of routine mukbang how you make tiktoks sweater collection 50 random facts tag chubby bunny challenge burning my exs stuff burning stuff tping a house a day in the life of your cat drum and sing a song (abc's song, london bridge is falling down, happy birthday) destroying a pair of shoes with your teeth. (It would be sexy) eat weird stuff like octopus and frogs   I would tots watrch any of these!
This one was fun
I really loved the video, it was very genuine
I feel you on the showering thing. I always shower 2-3 times a day
collie-flower
0:36 Emma: "I touch my cats-"   Shane yaw: "did someone say touch cats??"
I actually need to shower and honestly now I'm going to.
The cat just silently judging and walking sassy
are we gonna get a curry soup recipe orrrr
emma makes me so excited to live alone
Bacon in America started in the 1990's. Google is dank.
Emma wearing Patagonia *insert VAMO ARGENTINA meme here*
THE  way she pronounces tempeh is so cuteee wtffff HASHAHA
i hope i get to a point in life where my cats casually stride across my countertops
emma started drumming and changed fr
got out of bed and showered for the first time in five days
If she’s vegan how come she’s eating eggs...
Search about allah
oh my god you’re so lovable
You’re beautiful 🔥🤍
emma saying cauliflower is the HIGHLIGHT of my day... not even lying 🥰
i love you so much emma! you'll probably never see this but i luv u so muchhh ahhh
at 4:03 why does it look like the cats head is missing😭😭😂
I always forget that like she doesn’t know who I am and that we aren’t friends. Like I just caught myself answering back to her and like trying to make a joke with her and then got sad because she can’t hear me. 😅
make merch out of the second drawing lmao
i got my drivers license last week, just like we always talked about
I love sooo much that drums make her feel better. Also Emma def suggest doing something that involves community and people. Being alone this much def will take a toll on you!!!
I love watching emma's cats in the background of all her videos
oh emma started drumming she changed. there u go emma, i said it
Believe it or not, positioning eggs and bacon as breakfast was the result of a deliberate advertising campaign on behalf of a pork company. In the 1920s, the Beech-Nut Packing Company, hired Edward Bernays, a public relations and advertising expert, to increase consumer demand for bacon
i love when ur cats are in the background of ur vids. i just stare at them they r so cute
can we talk about emmas tv with the cameras

emma sitting right in front of the screen showing her cameras SCREAMS “don’t fuck w me”

ever since emma started playing drums she’s changed 🙄
literally paused the video and went and took a shower after about 5 days of depression swamp creature vibes. THANK YOU EMMA
is no one else gonna talk about the bagel on the floor while she was walking ? 10:00
Please just stop being so CAAAAAAH-uuute!
When you said Alexa start 20 minute timer my Alexa literally started a 20 minute timer 💀
The chaotic energy never fails
13:20 just had me dead 😂 like just by the way that she was sitting and how there were just cats walking around in the background... the moment was just so wholesome 😭
Not emma activating my Alexa
EC THE FUCKING GOAT
In italy for breakfast we eat milk and biscuits
I don’t want this to sound weird, but I watch your vlogs when I shower (when I’m home alone) so it’s not SPOOKY
the avocados are mediocre.... just like me
at this point, emma is just slowly turning into her dad
20:22
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates⭕️
Ok I know you never read these but holy cow you should try this coconut milk as a coffee creamer. I've turned my entire family onto it (cow milk creamer users... :/). Seriously tastes better than whole cream and MUCH better than califa almond milk.  I liked it below, they started selling it in easy pour bottles...  https://www.target.com/p/thai-kitchen-coconut-milk-25-36-fl-oz/-/A-78718098
this video felt like an acid trip
Wait emma that playlist is so cute thanku for sharing
19:54 “EarLmoNd MiLk!¿”
Good morning everybody, she’s trending today ✨
The fact that I actually went and showered when she said that we should.
I can’t speak for others, but I love to hear u play the drums ❤️
My favorite color is green and brown
I stan her dad so much oh my gosh. 💕
I want her hoodie it looks so comfy
Sitting here doing my makeup and Alexa listened to Emma but won’t listen to me when I got to get up early for an interview....mmmmk
i came here to say that emma is all of us rn and no one can tell me otherwise. but i mean maybe that’s just me... no it’s all of us, okay bye💞
i completely forgot she was from northern california till she said “hella” lmao
Can't explain how much i love watching your videos! You are so funny! You make me cry of laughter!  Cant wait to watch the next video and remember you are beautiful! Xxx
Emma you drink so much coffee how are you alive. Also emmaaa why don’t you have tie dye shorts in your stooorre
You made my echo speaker set a 20 minute timer at the end 😂
Thank u for being a genuine, honest human emma, love u lots💞💞💞 fly sneaks btw!!
—(EMMA    ,  right , showered , ty )—. —( paperwork is delaying my shower  ; .(....     )—
Emma you are 1: one of the most beautiful people without makeup (like an off duty VS model type beat) 2: I kinda think you’re feeling anxious and depressed because you may need a project or something to work on. Like start a lil art studio or something like that!
I just adore Emma ❤️
if u haven't showered yet today, or this week- EMMA DO NOT EVEN COME AT ME LIKE THAT 🖐🏼😭😭
Terrific sound on drums.  Kudos for trying and sharing.  Wow!
Show us your shoe a bag collection please
😭😭 why did my Alexa just put 20 mins on the clock like wtf
look at emma turning her channel into a cooking channel, im living for it
emma’s cool man
You set off my Alexa at the end lmaooo
Don’t let anyone tell you different, I like the drums
finding comfort in knowing I buy the same mustard as emma chamberlain
The fact that california thinks this is a taco HURTS
my alexa set a timer 🤣
I woke up feeling like shit today, but thank you for making me feel better 🥺💕
i cant be the only one to notice the bruise on her neck
did anyone go shower when she said to? cause I did lol
Emma you could play with your cats as content!!
Oh my god! I have the same fluffy blanket as emma lmao
emma's dad sounds amazing
The roommate that finds it hahahahah 🤣 me everyday!

I feel like we should name her drum set .
I think you look amazing with short hair 🙂
Lol shes so entertaining
This made my day 100% times better, she actually makes me so happy
You’re dope playing those drums huh❤️
anyone know where her black split pants are from?
2:41 I am not going to say what it is you just have to find out for your self.
emma i love you
We love our Emma uploads, stay shining Queen👑💙🥰
Emma you are so pretty!!
I am I the only one that is worried that you can see her security camera angles on the tv in the back?
I fucking love the forehead kisses thank you emma
Ok so nobody is gonna talk about how the cat is starting at the sink at 4 minutes...
I wish Emma was my friend because she literally makes my day
Wait so if you are vegan how do you eat eggs?
you took 'relatable' to a whole other level honestly this is speaking volumes to me it's unbelievably comforting....here i am in my fave fleece breaking down over bacteriology feeling awful
emma i jam when you play guitar keep it going
Eggs and bacon is a marketing scam created years ago to sell more bacon because it wasn’t selling well so someone was hired (forget the name) to use the media and marketing to say bacon was good for you so people will start eating it so everyone started eating it and now it’s a staple
u literally made me feel so good right now. i adore you. i´m bad at commenting videos so i think that´s it, bye!
emma seems lowkey depressed :(
YES NEW VIDDD AHHh
air toaster
The man who normalized eggs and bacon for American breakfasts is Edward Bernays. It’s actually really interesting to learn about. He’s Sigmund Freud’s nephew
I hadn’t showered in 4 days and when emma said pause this and go shower, I 100% did. Thank you Emma. ❤️
emma sitting there coloring in her hoodie meanwhile we can see her fucking security cameras for her own fucking mansion is just truly the most iconic scene I've ever known
u and nailea should collab
guys i have the same air fryer as emma chamberlain omg :)
lol i have the same dressing as you and idk that just makes me feel cool lmao  (i love you!)
How do I never get bored of her doing the most mundane things
“I forgot my camera here, I hope you enjoyed watching my cats eat” 😂 just forgot what you were doing for a min.
Why does Emma hit different
When you were telling us to shower I felt like you were talking directly to me with my depressed self who struggles to get up and shower.
i literally want to be friends so bad
I’m a 25yo who’s working from home and I can totally relate to this
oh wow, emma has changed ever since she started drumming...
“oh Emma started drumming she changed..”
keep your tortillas in the fridge if you don't already
my dad’s kitchen is my favorite playlist right lot, thank you emma for making me not feel so in the dumps❤️
Can we just talk how Emma’s hair is a mood in the first last half get me?
I missed you Emma. Needed that extra forehead kiss🥺💛
Why do I feel like her life is getting really toxic? She needs some new hobbies, fun activities and definitely some time out in the nature✨
20:21 scared me. 😐😂
Not me just figuring out that the tv behind her it’s her security cam pics and not regular pictures lmao
i literally luv Emma
Edward bernays helped convince Americans to eat eggs bacon & sausage by getting doctors to say it was healthy on tv. Around 30’s. He’s the father of propaganda.. You askeddd
I feel like Miley Cyrus and Emma would be good friends 💫
Emma just started a timer on my Echo...
I swear we're very alike, except that's what goes on in my mind. At the point where I literally just don't care anymore.. about ANYTHING!! it sucks cause it wrecks your relationships with people but honestly I don't even need people, I got my own beliefs that make me not feel alone. I probably shouldn't even have people around me because of the person that I am, which I need to change. So maybe it's all for the better yk
Beautiful kitchen! Would love to do a food blog but I really don’t have a kitchen so to speak. Was I suppose to learn something from this? Lost time I’ll never get back. You don’t know from mental breakdowns. I’m so broke I can’t even afford a breakdown. I would love an air fryer or a smart pot. Ok Boomer I’m out of here. Peace
I honestly never thought of putting a mask on and then to take a shower 🤯 thank youuuuuu
Anyone elses Alexas go off lmao
the song kool by Benee fits emma in my opinion
Good
"everything is easier with sharp knives" .......while using a spoon lmaooo
emma * puts oil to an AIR FRYER *
Can you drop the curry soup recipe?
Lmao when emma said “Alexa 20 mins on the clock.” My Alexa was like “okay setting a timer for 20 mins.” I’m dead
the energy in this video is truly unparalleled
Does anyone else know why the fuck all the small and medium cat sweat pants ARE OUT OF STOCK
Dude I wanna find my emma drum set...
does anyone know what her spotify acc is??
so you showering motivated me to shower. and go pick up my antidepressants that i’ve been putting off picking up for a week. i love watching your stuff bc i relate to you so much. much love, and thank you for posting videos from the bottom of my heart. ❤️

She looks like the girl version of timothee chalamet 😍

I Love EMMA and I Love TEMPEE :)

Emma can we please be friends I feel like we’d be good friends
The whole time I was looking for a air fryer.. that’s a toaster oven Emma
the fact that she's cooking tempeh or tempe as indonesian said is making me so happy 😁
What’s the tea?? I’m lost what happened with her and the Dolan twins?
emma i got your spray from bad habbits <3
😌
this feels so personal right now... watching this post/mid breakdown
haha Emma dont even worry about it. One of my friends invited me and this other girl over. We were really excited and I was in a really good mood. Then she texted me back telling my I could’’t go over... while I was on my way. Why do friends have to be so fake 😩😔. Well I’m gonna go cry now
5:17  is a ✨ mood ✨
Hang-outing with emma is a blessing
Somebody please buy her an Alexa ✨
Snore.
Please drop a tutorial on those pesto eggs ASAP as possible 🥚 🤪
The fact that she's look like animation movie character
I’ve been listening to my dads kitchen everyday!! Love it
One of the funniest videos you've ever done. I loved it!!!!!! Thank you for the videos , the laughs, and the good vibes ❤❤❤❤
PLAY THE DRUMS MOOOORE! WE LOOOOVE<3

Cat in background
Emma TRAVELLLL   Put your mind to it AND just TAKE the risk  Go for a natural place  That could help
i love you bestie
We didn’t see the tempeh done
1:56 ..... *NuGa naReuL maGaDo*
When she said Alexa mine woke up and was like sorry I don’t know that I’m guessing it’s coz of they American accent since I’m English haha
thank u emma
Emma I'm in a not sober state and that alarm noise sent me into another dimension oh my
emma and nai would BREAK the internet 🧎‍♀️🧎‍♀️just think about it
I have same pullover but different colour 🤓
The Hiiiiiii at the start tho so cute 💗
yass tempe , nice girl
I love how open and honest she is with her mental health
Just a security FYI, don't reveal sensitive info like the security cameras position (shown many times in this video)... There are many stalkers out there (many examples last year unfortunately) that can use this info to their advantage... Stay safe
Does any body think emma has changed because of 🥁 drumming??! 😃
I thought she was gonna be sponsored by her toaster
Happy birthday yaya gosselin I hope you are having a great day today 👌🏼❤️❤️😏
People be saying Emma doesn’t have a life or it’s boring. It’s because of corona!!!! Everybody should be like Emma and stay home🤔
I always genuinely feel like I’m hanging out with Emma when I watch her videos it’s so sweet
We want the soup recipe!!!!!
Emma’s drumming skills are immaculate
did she just said tempe? omggg
as a percussionist/ drummer, I can truthfully say, her drumming skills are FIRE 🔥🔥 like literally, amazinggggg
Hey!        Yes you       Are you still here???            Ugh.          Leave.            Why r you still HERE??             Anyways have a bad day JK               GO LEAVE WHY R YOU STILL READING????          have you ever realized she is a GEMINI         -_-
we are the same person like i wish we could be friends
Are people's lives really this sad and boring?
that's criminal to get famous and eat someone else's Jewish food and use their identity thats some masons shit!
Go emma go 😅💗
this is one of her best vids i've watched this over 10 times
what episode is that in the twilight zone!
Is egg veg?
lifestyles of the quiet rats!
Literally not Emma who said a bunch of stuffs she can do but the only problem is that she just doesn't wanna do it Lmfao very much Gemini vibes
tip for scooping out avacados, cut it into a little grid looking thing and then scoop. it’s way easier
“I hate being roommates with myself.” 🤣🤣. So relatable!
Awwe lol emma i love you😂
i relate so much to the breakdowns yes... i’m glad you feel better. 💖 i love the drum parts yes queeen
waitt did u just said tempe? an indonesian food? wow
thank God for drums
I have a NEW Routine every time Emma is playing drums I'm also gone play because I'm not good so I need to learn :(()))
More vocal impressions in one video than the rest of your discography combined. Is this 2021 edition Emma?
emma can we start a band
"wow... im out of all my chamberlain coffee mason jars... WHAT is a GIRl to DO..."  im.   dying.   BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Not my Alexa in the other room starting a 20 minute timer lol
I love that I normally have to scream at my Alexa for her to respond, but u saying it in a quiet sassy way, setting an alarm for 20 min.. it made my day!✨
ok, THIS IS FOR ALL OF EMMA"S VIEWERS WHO HAVE BEEN WATCHING BEFORE SHE WAS A COOK!!! ~ sooooo....   ......   how the heck did we get to such an amazing emma????   she thought she could never do it.....    but here we are....  rambling on about cooking....  ily and amazing job you are so awesome <3 <3 <3
Emma is now my favourite YouTuber
Wanna know something funny? I burped the same time Emma did
bro imagine being able to drum? at 10pm? without bothering the neighbors?? I love it
all i'VE hearing about goat over the years is bad stuff... combine this with my trust issues and, well, as much as i love nike sneakers, i don't think i can shop from them :/ which makes me sad tbh. anyway you ain't the only one having breakdowns lately bc i got finals rn and im literally like a fucking ZOMBIEEEEEEEE
I know you say you do the same thing everyday, so I have a suggestion to switch it up! BUY ROLLER SKATES!! Roller skating is sooo fun
Please link the curry soup :)
I really do vibe every time she plays with the drums.
Breakfast are different because of different cultures and availability of the ingredients
The fact my Alexa set a time because of Emma 😭🤣
night night drumming.  yr getting pretty bad ass.
man I wish I could take the time to have a mental breakdown ToT
4:30 you look so mature, smart and hard working in those glasses... oh wai.. xD
I made a video about everyday being the same as well... Spain is closed down!!🥺
Is it just me or the drum beat sounds like sweater weather beats?
1:34 hun im NOT AT ALL TRYING TO BE A KAREN but is just me or is it like unsanitary to just let ur cat on the counter....like a counter where u eat food and stuff...like i know ur not making food on that counter and the food might not even touch that counter but idk like wat if u put a plate or something there (as in a plate on the counter) and then whatever's in the plate just falls onto the counter....like im pretty sure u would forget the fact ur cat was on it.....but then again i don't know if u clean the counter or anything....which u prob do clean it so there is absolutely no point in me writing this comment but I'm still gonna comment it just cuz i wrote a lot for this (more than I've ever written for a school essay-)
Pls bake something next time😌
No one is talking about her security cams 👀 Happy she has them to be safe!! :))
I can just imagine once Emma is like 30 she’s still doing the forehead kiss and her vids will be her making lunch for her kids is that just me
we’ll never get sick of the drum beats!! I love it
emma: "...sharp knife...listen if you're under the age of 10 you didn't here me say that" also emma: curses HAHAAH ily
i love the drum breaks
its high time we get a cat video
I swear everyone loves Emma 🥰
Me watching emma be like 😅😅😅😅😅bc she swaering and im younger than 10:^^
Soup recipe video?
Girl I really did it🤣🤣🤣 applied coffee mask n took shower. Well done😌🤗😅🍀
I really needed that forehead kiss
Why do i love those forehead kisses????¿¿¿
i love watching these recent vlogs when i have a bad mental health day they make me feel less lonely
Bacon became a breakfast food the same way eggs did: pork companies paid ad agencies to advertise it that way to sell more bacon.
Emma chamberlain: the spokesperson for drumming for mental health
Yall amurricans do be inventing bikes with food again...😂
omg i cant stop laughing when she said " but i dont have an alexa" hahahaha love her💖😂
I love how since there is literally nothing to do, trying the air fryer is a “fun activity” XD
Emma’s hair at 4:30 represents my life
Wait why does she kinda look like Aidan Gallagher 😂
Id love too see a cooking with emma (t But like try a tasty recipe)
*Emma asking for consent to give a forehead kiss* Me: nahhhh Her: *forehead kiss anyway*
white priveledge
*emmas cats in the background just chilling on the countertop*
Dos anyone else get inspired to go to bed early ,wake up early, cook for yourself and just have a productive day or is it just me ?
“i’m going sleep goodnight” also *starts drumming*
ur literally my comfort person bye
This is how many people like Emma even if she’s a “failure”
THE CAMERAS AHAHAHAH  emma = ✨famous celebrity✨
BRUSH YOUR TEETH EMMA
uhh emma u don’t have to put oil if ur gonna air fry ur food the main purpose of an air fryer is so that there’s less oil so yeah
Thank you. For honesty.   Of Our Real Life.
F**k Emma Ily so much, youre so unique and gorgeous. I love watch you playing drums so dont stop doing that. Also dont stop beeing yourself. Much love from Argentina <3
while Emma was talking about goat, I DEADASS THOUGHT HER CAT WAS A GOAT I—
Emma if playing the drums makes you happy then pls keep doing that. Trust that we love it/seeing you thrive. Personally I think they make for great scene transitions.  Also I've never seen a funnier ending to a video, usually they wind down but no. You had me rolling. Thank you.
just wanted to say i love the lil drum breaks ok bye 😽
Lmaoo why are the drums faced the corner
Emma and Harrr (aka) Wroetoshow would be a good couple
Maybe get a job and you’ll see that you can live without strangers opinions
fan noise
New to your channel but your video literally made me feel good. Been feeling so on edge lately
Wow https://youtu.be/VSpgaN3wuag
i absolutely love how much i see myself in emma like bitchhhhhhhh the mental breakdowns the learning a new instrument and the not showering just because you don't have the drive to and being brutally honest about it
wait putting on a face mask before getting in the shower is absolutely fucking genius and i'm mad i didn't think of it
Gawd i love her so much😂♥️
“squishing my sausage” 💀😭
"idk if im in a bad mood" or everyone is just annoying me.
Plz do a house tour 💕
Emma if you have no idea for next video just do a day with my babies (cat) 🐱 😂😂 or pampering ur cat by buying them toys or treats and kinda make treats test if they like it? Or try cook for ur cat ✨🥺 I do love ur cat content tho 💖 a day vlog with ur cat also fine 😭
You won’t see this but these kinda of videos really help me. I’m in a similar mental place right now with breakdowns and crying and trying to do something with my days. Not wanting to brush my teeth before bed sometimes or shower. It’s really helpful to see I’m not the only one. Thanks Emma.
You got it. You’re good - you got this Emma. Chur for the drums and the normal depiction of life
You’re freaking killing it man! Love your work. Thank you for realistic days
me nodding my head to emma drumming : 😎😎😎👁👅👁
My Alexa just set a timer for 20 minutes...
Emma looks like a Tim Burton character 🥺 she’s so gorgeous
emma if your having a mental breakdown, it’s okay take your time. your mental health is more important than filming for us!
in israel if you go to a restaurant for breakfast ppl usually get a big green salad/greek salad with like a smaller tuna, egg, eggplant salad with a bunch of cheese spreads and sometimes an omlet with that. also sometimes a grill cheese as well, it kind of depends on the person. just wanted to share that cause you mentioned breakfast around the world haha
her parents seem to deal with her mental health in such a healthy and caring way, it truly warms my heart <3
please keep showing ur drum progression, I find it so entertaining and ur already so good
EMMA YOU ARE SO PRETTYYYYYY!!!💕💓
emma try making broccoli soup from scratch
Emma I love you. This I has been me living alone in quarantine too
Hahaha I have a Spotify playlist of my dad's music too 😅 it's nostalgic
no one emma have a sponsorship for every video, we stan, imagine being such a queen
Who’s Frankie Ik she has 2 cats but I don’t remember Frankie
Emma plz tell us the curry soup recipe
somebody in the comments said "emma is my older sister i never had" and as an only child i couldn't agree more
literally represents the voices in my head
I think an a-line chin length haircut would look cute on you!
i want the soup recipe, make a video cooking it!
Emma should make a garden and grow vegetables
*kiss* "goodnight sweetheart" I LOVE YOUUU  <3 <3
You can tell she’s getting better at playing the drums!!! I see the improvement ❤️
you know youre rich and pirvekleged when you can afford a mental breakdown. this is  just another way of Emma flexing on us
Do you just buy healthy things? How about candy, chocolate?
I feel safe watching her videos stg
Drinking coffee ain't gonna help you with your anxiety. Take care of yourself.
only 200K followers till our Emma gets a diamond plaque 🔥
why do I get shia labouef vibes from this emma
Teach us how to make the soup!!
Did Emma turn on anyone else’s Alexa!? “Timer set for 20 minutes” 😂
Emma using scissors and not her teeth to remove the plastic from her markers is honestly inspiring.
This is a tolerable vegan
Pestos not vegetarian😢
Ugh so many things I wanna say: 1. I will never get mad ever for you playing the drums because you can literally tell it boosts your serotonin (bragging or not) 2. Anything you do in your videos I will absolutely love because it’s you, doesn’t matter if you’re cooking, eating, making coffee, shopping, getting ready, any of the things that you could ever put into your videos 3. I’m so proud of you for trying to accomplish tasks and do things to boost your mental health when it IS easier to lay in bed all day. 4. I adore your personality and I am thankful for your existence on this Earth. And I know I’m one voice of millions, and sometimes we feel like our one voice doesn’t matter, but I’m not afraid to try, for the simple fact that maybe you will read my comment, and it will be a positive energy for you🥺 it’s sooo easy to focus on the negative because when we are sad our brains just like suction that shit in like a vacuum. But anyways, if you see this I love youuuuuuu.😄❤️
Ur trending in Canada
Emma should be a voice actor omg
Emma will you be my friend
Wait can u actually do little drumming tutorials I wanna learn👉🏻👈🏻
I need “see Yah next week BitcHhhh” merch
Can I just say that you don’t have to force yourself to make something interesting because it’s a job or what have you. If you need to take a break, then take a break love! I can tell that you’ve been stressed because I’ve been going through that too 😖
Emma I wanna hug you
i swear i zoned out for like 5 seconds rewinded the video a bit & she already had like 3 different conversations 😭
does she know the point of an air frier is to not use oil. hehe ily emma
I’m not vegetarian so this is an honest question: are eggs vegetarian?? She said she used vegetarian sausage so I’m just confused because I thought she was vegan before but now I don’t even know
Cuts towards palm, then talks about how sharp her knives are...
Hey Timothee..!
I need to know how meme feels about the suuuperr high converse
get air dry clay and start making pottery
Also holy cow talk about security system lol that amount of cameras! But after hearing g roman Atwood story guess I don't blame you
you're  not like everyone...that's why i like you so much
Emma starting drumming, like she kinda changed.. :/
so what's in that golden soup
Emma why don’t you roller skate or ice skate it’s very fun and different
Haha damn I was waiting for that white cat to jump off the top ropes during the goat ad lol
WHEN YOU SAID ALEXA MINE WENT OFF
yes lol I always put my face mask on before getting in the shower bc I can rinse it off in there
I honestly hope Emma feels better. Her humor/aesthetic is being this sad, emotionally unstable type of girl which you can clearly tell she's really going thru it. I hope she finds what she needs within herself. 🙏
You could always try clip in extensions !!! Alsooo try buying squishmallows it really helps the happiness!!
TEMPEE!!
Every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus is Lord to the glory of God the Father. Sow not to the flesh which is corruptible but unto the Spirit of Christ Jesus whom the Lord giveth to them that obey him. The wages of sins is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus. For your sins which are done in your corruptible bodies have seperated you from the eternal almighty and holy God, Jesus. Adulteries, fornications, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatries, covetousness, lyings, boastings, thefts, murderers, revellings, extortionings is all unrighteousness and the unrighteous shall have their part in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone. And they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh, for the smoke of their torment shall ascend forever where the fire is never quenched and the worm never dies. Fear the Lord and depart from evil that the blindness that has clouded your minds and hearts may cease and that you may see the glorious light of the gospel of Jesus Christ. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved. He that committeth sin is the servant of sin and the servant does not abide in the house forever, but a Son does. If the Son shall set you free then you shall be free indeed. Therefore unto all who are born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but are born of God, receive the power to become the sons and daughters of the living God! The apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ were given commandment by the Lord Jesus to preach the gospel after he died for the sins of the world on the cross at calvary, pouring out his innocent blood to make atonement for our sins against God. And the gospel they preached is what the Bible calls “The power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth.” They preached, Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost (Acts 2:38). For this promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the Lord God shall call. Be not deceived, the ungodly shall not stand in the judgement, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. If you will therefore receive the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost, you will have the power to live as a saint and inherit the kingdom of heaven reserved for those who have received righteousness by Jesus Christ who is risen from the grave by the operation of the Holy Ghost and seated at the right hand of power. Blessed are they that hear the word of God and do it.

Crazy seeing this video.  The YouTube algorithm is scary.  I use to live here.  I have so many stories to share  with you about what went on in and around your house.  And why things are built a certain way.
that intro was SO cute
There’s a smudge on her camera at 9:28(:

Don’t u love it when ✨Emma✨
lol your cats in the back throughout the whole video i love you and ur cats
Who else was just watching her cat try to get in the sink while she was talking
To answer the 'why eggs and bacon' question: it's all PR! The "father of Public Relations" and nephew of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, Edward L. Bernays, worked on a PR campaign for the Beech-Nut Packing Company because, by the 1920s, less manual labor meant lighter breakfasts which meant less bacon sales for Beech-Nut. Bernays managed to round up doctors that chose a heavy breakfast over a light breakfast (on a general survey) and thus, the hearty eggs and bacon all-american breakfast was born.   TLDR; capitalism.
If it isn’t Emma saying “It’s kinda fire” every time she plays the drums...
Is this how life could be like without the stress of college and grad school 🤧🤧
Oh Emma started drumming, she changed
i dont care if your doing completely nothing u entertain me and its like i have a friend with meee
I feel like everytime I watch your videos it’s like we’re on FaceTime🤪
Does anybody know where those clear glasses are from???? I think they are so cute!!!
How many cats you have 🤪
Emma: I think you guys want a grocery haul Me: no I want a whole dressing only haul
So when are you writing a cookbook
next video no talking only drumming you cant explain whats happening just drum
16:13 the way she said frankie is so cuteee, i laughed
My mental health isn’t always great and painting by number is one of the only things that shuts my brain off and calms me down super quick, highly recommend!!!
I LOVE YOU EMMA!!!

You boost my serotonin more than anti depressants ever could
So chaotic. Love it. 😂😂
guys you should listen to Emma chamberlains podcast if you don't already! she's so real with us about her mental health, it makes me feel less alone, highly recommend :)
“Im trying to decide whether or not I’m in a bad mood” never related to something more hahahahhaha
i love how emma thinks her videos are bad and boring when there literally the highlight of everyones day when u watch them !
whats is it with the mental break downs you have money, health and a good life, what do you freak about so much :)
I need her to post like everyday cuz her videos r the only thing that keep me entertained
I LOVE your honesty!! It really helps to know I'm not the only one who has mental breakdowns!
Emma has an amazing personality love it
So many moods in one video and I am living for it! 💚👌🏻
Emma made my alexa go off 😭
I don’t know if I’m the only one but I really want Emma to move out from LA cause honestly they don’t deserve her, she’s way toooo honest and humble to be surrounded by a lot of stupid “influencers”
I wake up 🤜🏻 I eat 🤜🏻 💀😂. I think Travis Barker should make an appearance at some point down this drumming phase🥁🤔😬
U always say ur in a bad mood but girl u look amazing 🤧
Emma u need to make French fries in ur air fryer
Thanks for the 20 minute timer
5:58 that pause 😂😂

emma can you learn jessie's girl on the drums that would be so sick
I thought she was vegan
literally I was procrastinating a shower so ty for telling me to I did and I feel much better 😌
I just wanted to say Emma literally helps my mental health so much😌
How have I not watched her until now? (Ive heard of her but I've been living under a rock)
dear emma, i feel like if you actually did have like really good roommates it would help with your mental health. like its really awesome that you're independent and on your own already but i think that having a roommate would be good for you.  <3
I'm just gonna say it. I want Emma's house when I grow up but I know I'm not gonna be able to afford it.🥲
4:00 literally the most gemini thing I have heard
Im literally watching this in the shower
i shit you not i paused the video and went and showered i needed someone to tell me to shower so thank you for that haha love you
her dad sending her a drum beat when she’s sad knowing it will cheer her up is just so cute.
10:16 SHE SAID ILY AHAHAHHA THATS SO ICONIC AND FUNNY TO ME WHY AM I THIS WAY
WE WANT THE SOUP RECIPE
she gets funnier and funnier by the day
Emma is literally so fucking relatable and funny I genuinely laughed at this vid
“And then I touch m.......my cats”
Why do I feel like Emma gets depressed when she has dark hair 🤔
Emma, can I ask why your drums face the corner?
Love you🥰
Love you
i love the patagonia
This shit was SO sadly depressing YET relatable!! Awe I love you ❣️
Hey girl you can freeze your soup. Also heat what you want and put the rest in the fridge.  And you can also freeze broccoli 🥦. A quick Google look up with tell you how. Sorry I'm probably much too old to be watching your content but I love it so much. Anyway you'd be surprised at what you can freeze and reheat later for the same fresh tastes. ❤❤
Emma being a Gemini for 22 mins and 11 seconds
u should call this video “i had a bad day”
Ten year olds when emma said she didn’t say it if your under the age of ten: 🤪🔪
EMMA!  Idk about you but people needa stop promoting their YouTube channels in the comments...  anyways, everybody go subscribe to my channel! im trynna hit 1k by the end of this year.
my Alexa just set an alarm for 20 min thank u miss Emma 21:26 lol
I feel like emma would be happier anywhere else but LA
That’s so cute of your dad to send you a drum beat to learn to feel better ily
I’m so proud of you for playing the drums
Emma your beats are fire
I love how raw Emma is, her videos are like talking to a friend.
You say everything everyone wants to say but doesn’t. 🙌🙌🤣🤣👌

I LOVE THE DRUM CONTENT EMMA!!!
what the fuck emma i literally pause the video and took a shower
I never had mental breakdowns up until I got COVID around Christmas .... now I have them like once a day 😂 it helps to cry it out tbh so I'm  here for it
🥱
you made my alexa go off and it was very loud
POSTT THE SOUP RECIPE PLS
“And then I’m going to immediately remove it and put it back in the container because I don’t actually want to eat the rosemary”😂😂😂😂
2020/2021 lockdown quarantine social distanced mood 😭
she’s actually the coolest omg
EMMA. where is your twisty lamp from
i in fact did shower when she told me to
She's weird like it
I always forget that she doesn’t have a job... YouTube is her job. That’s so hard to wrap my mind around. She’s not in school, she doesn’t have to go to work like the rest of us... she’s just putzing around all day and... that’s her life. She doesn’t need to have career goals or promotions or whatever. This is it
girl i LIVE for these drums... i think i may need to get some but not learn shit. just hittem
I fucking love when she adds in the alarm sound....said no one ever. Lol Cringe every time but I still love her for it lol. Keeps me on my toes.
PLSS IN THE LAST COOKING VIDEO EMMA WAS JOKING ABOUT GETTING AN AIR FRYER AND NOW HERE SHE IS AHAHBAIHCB
In the air fryer you could make avocado fries
emma your hair is really cute
Make more skateboarding vids plz Emma
Keep your tortillas in the freezer!! When you want to use them just take them out like 15 mins before and they thaw so quickly
EMMA. If those are your dads kitchen songs or whatever then he is the chillest EVER & I want to be his friend. KILLER playlist. *chefs kiss* 🤌🏼💋

Was I the only one who got chills when her alarm went off?
Me just staring at her hair that’s standing up 👁👄👁
I didn't want to take a shower this week but fuck,you convinced me
Throw DAT tortilla straight on the burner.
Emma:  Get out of bed, pause the video, go take a shower!" Me having already contemplating/procrastinating taking a shower: UGH! *Pauses video and takes a shower*
border collie lmao
not my alexa almost starting a 20 min timer
me too emma... me too 💕
BRB gonna go take a shower
Look for Haas or Reed avocados, the thicker an avocado is the bigger seed it has, so look for length and if the skin feels kind of dry, like really dry its possible that it is a pale avocado, these are great blended with a couple of hot peppers and sour cream. Greetings from Michoacan, Mexico the avocado-land!
It's so nice to share you're thoughts & feelings. It's just something someone should not leave behind I believe.  So thank you & I would love to listen at all of you're storys. Love whitnessing all youre emotions & all the laughs.  Thank you, Emma So much  Excuse my English writing. I'm not perfect yet & from Germany 🇩🇪💖
I really want ur old editing backk😭😔
not me laughing abt decklin almost falling in the sink lmaoo
i love that this vlog is so relatable 🥺
Emma makes me actully want to get up and do things ;)
Just realised Emma has scarily serious CCTV
Bruh i'm never gonna get sick of Emma playing the drums its honestly fire.
who else actually showered when emma did ✋🏼😌
I love Emma and her talking about her mental health really helps me.. but I have to say it! She's not drinking coffee, she's drinking almond milk on ice with coffee as an accesory
My everyday mood 4:00
Emma: “I got avocados...”  the avocados for literally no reason: 🔄🥑
this girl is me lmaoo
I swear sometimes I feel like I am on the passenger seat, talking with that friend that can multitask, drive and talk like a parrot, meanwhile I'm just nodding or saying YUP, NOP, AJA.... and the way she edits the videos is incredibly smart and innovative. Those zooms, close-ups, and changes of positions of the screen, to give drama, are well done, and I never get dizzy or tired. CAN'T BELIEVE IT SHE IS USING ONLY ONE CAM, ONE!!!!
hi emma ! love your videos so much because you stay real with yourself , been following for a long time now and i´m always exited to see your new posts <3 btw im speaking from portugal and since you talked abt breakfast foods, here the most common food is just a plain bread w butter and to drink eighter an expresso or a latte. if we're feeling fancy we also eat sweets like pastries and such. love you ! xx
Aunt Flo's coming. You'll be ok. 😊❤️
OMGGG I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!
Alexa said that you're Drake
Maybe you shouldn't be hanging out with James Chupacabra.
i would pay to get the cat art
Emma is the only other person I know who is like really hard on herself like I am. To ease her anxieties 1. I love the drum content 2. YOU ARE PUTTING IN THE EFFORT FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH BE PROUD OF YOURSELF FOR TAKING THE STEPS EVEN IF IT DIDNT TURN OUT THE WAY YOU WANTED 3. I can see the boredom from the mundane everyday tasks. Buy some board games, puzzles, card tricks etc to keep yourself busy you’re rich anyway!
Not three sentences in and she drops an F bomb.  Real classy.......
I LOVE YOU
Girlll you hyped yourself up at the drum piece you learnt and then it went dead silent for a few seconds... how awkward Emma but I FREAKING LOVE IT❤️
emma’s mental health is shit because she has too much free time
PROVE MONEY DOESNT BUY HAPPINES
anyone else see that hickey at 9:18 ?
Emma please know, that when I have mental breakdowns or I’m just really upset I watch your videos. Because they make me feel so much better 🤍🤍
you know what im sick of?? youtubers using alarm sounds in videos. my fucking heart drops to my ass every time. the drumming can stay tho its very good
i WANT those shoes they are amaizng
she actually triggered my alexa and it spoke hella loud my whole family is sleeping 💀
I come for Emma and stay for the forehead kisses 😘 lol.
not me actually showering when emma did :)
Idk why but I love the way you say cauliflower but its probably because im from Oklahoma and we all talk like hicks
emma:u are not getting ripped off my dumbass:youre getting ripped on
I have this on repeat 22:01
You should get a dog
Emma you need some good CBD in your life!🙌🏼✨🤍🤍
I wanna see Emma make boba. that's it. that's the video.
When youtubers say “ALEXA” on their channels <<<<<<<
Me watching her with a face mask on before my shower talk about how you should put face masks on before a shower so it’s easier...
can we just sit here and just motivate emma bc shes so pretty, nice, funny, and has THE BEST wait wait wait lemme say that again THE BEST style so like EMMA GET YOUR BUT UP AND TAKE A NICE JOG AND GET READY and If that makes u do that then idk. lol
Love her cat jus chillin in the back while Emma was eating 🥺✨😭
stop nagging and enjoy life you will see the change also change ur view communicate with earth
https://youtu.be/PmEDAzqswh8
welcome to my world
K so like she def has addressed this but I just missed it? Since when does she eat real eggs? Cause like I thought u was vegan???
Edward Bernays decided that bacon was a breakfast food. But after the Industrial Revolution, during the Progressive Era of the early 1900s.
Girl I love you! I have mental breakdowns like every hour of the day so you aren’t alone lol. Love your simple videos and how naturally funny you are. Loving all the drum sección here and there. 😘😘
I’ve been watching u since I was like 10 ilysm keep up the good work I always hear u saw do people even like to watch my vids we love ur vids we would of left a long time ago if we didn’t like them 💗💗💗‼️
so emma why do you feed your cats on the counter? jw
“i never have like a super sExY... avocado” - emma 2021
Headphones felt that burp
me wanting to twin shoes w emma: *checks out goat*  also me: *sees the shoes r $428 canadian*   "heh no<3"

Please stop drawing painting or anything of the sort
She definitely needs therapy, as pretty much everyone (including me)
who the fuck just has rosemary...emma

my favorite emma quote: "nobody can talk to me for the next... rest of my life."
“CAN YOU NOT STOP IN THE MIDDLE IF THE ROAD YoUr So StUpId” i love emma
the amount of times i laughed out loud without realizing i was gonna and then immediately covering my mouth with my hand and just     👁👄👁 afterwards is not funny
Can someone please tell me why you like watching her like god

i appreciate how honest emma is! i also really hope teens aren’t romanticising the idea of having mental breakdowns, it’s not cool! let’s be positive and take care of ourselves hehe
amazing work emma😻😻
Emma is the only person I will watch doing nothing for 20 minutes straight
Not Emma looking like Wednesday Aadams
Bitch, you got my Alexa to set a timer for 20 minutes. Get outta here.

Soooo can I get that soup recipe orrr 👀👀?
you can tell emma gets bored living alone
Love ur videos but maybe not saying the phrase paw wow anymore
Actually, to answer your bacon question, Bacon was not always a breakfast food. Bacon was having a hard time selling in America, and we even traditionally ate meatless breakfasts. That is until a savvy marketer, Mr. Edward Bernays, (nephew of Sigmund Freud) came up with the genius idea to market Bacon as the new must-have breakfast food. After the campaign launched, Bacon and Eggs became the iconic breakfast duo we now know and love. (I am veggie so minus the love).   PS. I learned this in history class..... pray for our children
Emma try dancing(not the tiktok ones)
“Fuck I’m such an idiot” me every time anything goes moldy 😂
the trader joe's mozzarella almond cheese melts!! it's amazing 10/10
We don’t even get a promo code for GOAT wtfff??

let me put y'all on: spicy peanut vinaigrette salad dressing from trader joes trust me on this
Emma, 2 video's ago:   *"watch me get an air fryer next, everybody's obsessed with air fryers now. Like that's all anyone cares about anymore."*
i love the drums please never stop
Me having 3 forehead kisses in one video 🥰🥰🥰
Tortillas ask for nutrition … buy vitalmins
you should do a YouTube video of trying different breakfasts from different country's also do an English breakfast there fire!!!!!!!!
u are giving me the motivation to learn drums more. it’s like me and a friend are learning drums together and it makes me feels motivated
I love you
me watching emma explain panic attacks like  👀
i feel like she has so many pairs of shoes like that
Emma make a cake, green matcha ones:)

I feel like this video significantly lowered my vibrational frequency l 😅
U look like king Julian girl pls do the voice😭
Are u okay
Anyone else’s Alexa went off when she “Alexa 20 minutes”😭😭
Have u tried praying ? Or listening to worship music ? It helps!!! ❤️🙌🏻✝️🙏🏻
not my alexa going off and setting a timer for 20 minutes after she said “Alexa 20 minutes on the clock”
The way I actually paused the video, went to take a shower and then came back... this girl has too much of an influence in my life
You made my Alexa set a timer 🙄
Yesss she’s trending
I fucking love her sm she's my spirit animal
As someone who also lives alone and struggles with their mental health, soo many things in this video were relatable
Hey Emma. :)))  I know you won't read this but I thought id suggest a hobby for you or a game! SIMS !!  Hehe it's just so fun and it distracts me from my everyday  life so I recommend ehehhe
COLAB WITH NAILEA
Why is no one talking about Emma’s little bruise on her neck✨✨
Yes mama
Museum of Modern Art is typing...
Hey Emma 😁 just wanted to let u know that saying “let’s have a powwow” is racist. I’m sure u didn’t realize, so just make sure not to say it again ♥️
this is exactly the video I needed to see today, didnt get out of bed all day but now I've journaled and lit a candle and lay with my cats
please make a video with ur cats😌 I want to see how they interact with you
Emma is the biggest mood !
Did u mean versatility?
cooking with emma: curry soup
When you said "Alexa set a 20-minute timer,my Alexa heard it and set a timer" hahaha
Omg this was so funny. Love you Emma
18:17 thats was so aggressive IM SCREAMING
the Patagonia and iced coffee in a Mason jar are such a vibe. Also, just realized I too should attempt a jog at some point soon
Im sad that you had a mental break , but i love that you called your dad  . It shows what type of relationship y’all have and how open you can be with them . Most people don’t have that .
16:13 LMAO I THOUGHT THAT WAS A CARPET OR A BLANKET
please don’t say powwow
i feel like we are bestfriends
Emma:"You best believe i'm not going grocery shopping unless its a literal fucking emergency"  Also Emma: "Nothing makes me feel better than running errands"
Random but i always heard it wasn’t good to post your security camera set up, not to be that guy but always want you safe!
How is it possible that after all these years I still stan Emma? I’ve gone through like the different things identity crises and I find her relateable
okay but the drum beat she learnt at 5:41 sounds like the intro for sweater weather. great job emma!
Literally after she got back in her car after grocery shopping, I thought "I hope she does a grocery haul". Then not even two seconds later, she mfin delivered.
idk why Emma gives off very much like popular YouTuber teen mom
The cat by the sink lol
yo this video was hilarious for no reason lmfaoooooooo
Might sound weird but I would love to live with you! Love your virtual company :)
It’s wild that Emma’s so young and has her life so put together. She bought herself a toaster oven for her beautiful kitchen, like such a savage
Lol you turned my Alexa on 😭
Calls a Patagonia a “fleece”
You might be the most relatable person on planet earth & ily
i luv emma bc she is literally me-
emma your soup looks good
This video is a WHOLE MOOD.
DRUMMING EMMA DRUMMING EMMA
I just imagine in a few years Emma is going to quit her YouTube career and start a girl band and be the drummer 🤣🤣
I just had a really rough day and your videos always make me feel so much better! I love you Emma thanks ❤
Stranger: So uh why are you in love with this Emma chick? Me: Because she gives me forehead kisses 🥰
"and then i touch. my cats. at some point."
Emma is literally gorgeous even when she doesn’t try
Emma why don’t you learn how to knit 🧶 its really fun , calming and stress relieving. You can make everything you want! But at first its hard but if you do it a lot and exercise then you got it. I really recommend this to you for trying it. Make a video about it then we can all see. And also a tip: you can find 1000 of video’s and knit tutorials if you want to learn how to do it :)
You should start playing episode the community stories its so addicting
Okayyy ms emma I see the hickey

First I’m inspired to buy an air fryer .. and then I’m inspired to dye my hair. Glad I came. K thanks.
love you emma
Emma, have you ever tried to play Minecraft??
No one is sick of you on the drums... I LOVE IT! You are fire! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
when the point of an air fryer is to not have to use oil to fry and she still puts it...... me too
Emma is comical ! 😂🤍
She should make merch forehead kiss
can you do a haul?????
SIGMUND FREUD who is the granddaddy of psychology introduced bacon and eggs to his nephew in the 1920s!!!
The whole point of an air fryer is so it has no oil meaning less fat, and she literally put olive oil in it 💀
prolly my favourite video ever lmao
that water slide looked FREEZING lol, but it looked fun! also, i love your blonde hair!
“Fuck I fucked up everybody SHUT UP” 😂😂
why is she so funny like i laughed so hard watching this

EMMA PLS MAKE MONTAGES OF YOUR CATS EATING I MISS MY CATS SO MUCH
THOSE ARE THE SHOES I WANT DAMNIT
Emma the burping triggers me 😞
she should do a thrifting vlog
I think you should pack a suit case and take a vacation to Montana or somewhere quiet in a small cabin where it's lonely and you can have some fresh air for a change.
Emma: *im losing it* Aren't we all
Emma. I like the drum clips. Also you should bread the cauliflower and dip in barbecue. Then air fry.
emma vlogs are the best blogs
Walk+Run/2=jog
oka but literally every time i hear emmas theme intro song i think of bikini bottom
its the fact that I actually went and had a shower
I literally only come on youtube to watch your videos
Girl- if u wanna play drums - THEN PLAY THE FUCKIN DRUMS- u timid as hell

I would be 100% okay to see you do the same thing every day
"i have cauliflower i can cook in there... i also have indigestion"
Emma I seriously think you should go on social media less. Like if I were you, I would just put your phone away for 5 hours a day and see what you end up doing during then. Just try it!!
oops day lmao fuck your awesome
EMMA i just started watching you and i love your content and it make my dad better love you :)
I went to sleep when she gave me my goodnight kiss and I finished the video today 🥲🙂
i just had deja-vu at 11:09

Was it only me who went to bed with Emma then woke up with her and continued watching the video? Just me? Ok.
emma and jessie paege should start a band TBFH. jessie on the guitar/vocals and emma with the drums

Idk why but I couldn’t stop laughing when you held up the net of avocados and it did spin around
Imagine looking good without makeup
your forehead kiss made my day 10× better
emmas vlogs make me feel like we're on ft and i love it
"touch-- my cats"
i love how she takes a break sometimes and then doesn't film it, just so she can take an actual break of it all
Petition to get rid of the alarm sound in every video on YouTube
Okay but I like the random drumming .. just me?
Who else answers to Emma as if your watching an episode of Dora
to anyone reading this, including Emma, remember that your value is not based on how productive you are. it's okay to do absolutely nothing.
Do a business day vlog one day !!
9:01 ok josh dun
you actually made me get out of bed to shower because i’ve been putting it off for a couple hours so thank you
😍
Please never stop with the drums

EMmmaAA what CHEESE DO U USE
Trending #34 🤩
Emma!  A hickey?
hi queen when u told alexa to put 20 mins on the clock, my alexa heard you and put 20 mins on the clock
Does anyone else’s Alexa go off every time she says Alexa?
GUYS WHAT GLASSES DOES SHE HAVE
Please buy some crazy ass/ cute af wigs and just style wigs and outfits and fall in love with yourself! ❤️❤️❤️
yep, touch the cats.
Hey Emma, I love your videos I have been watching them for years! But please don’t say “let’s have a powwow”. Coming from someone who was born and raised on a reservation, it can be considered offensive to Native Americans. Powwows are ceremonies that we hold to honor our culture. 🤍
trump: 18:40  kamala: 18:50
the cat in the backround in 3:51... ITSSS SO CUTEEE
Emma stop I’m blushing
Meanwhile i need 10 layers to survive in nyc

I hope you find Jesus🥺
Ahh the highlight of my day
LMAO U SET OFF MY ALEXA WHEN U SAID ALEXA SCJEKDKFKFKFAHAHAHAHAH
OMG TEMPEH :3 YOU GONNA LUV ITT!! 🇮🇩
The reason why bacon became breakfast food was because at some point don’t remember where and when but they asked the president to advertise bacon and it became so famous it is now breakfast food the end
I love that she apologized after using Jesus’ name in vain ✝️
Why do the cats eat on the counter
okay but seriously- emma, if you make a separate vlog channel and post the same thing everyday, i WILL watch it everyday.
Never sick of the drums! 😎
emma makes me want to learn drums
and there goes my alexa
3:45 -- For those who are now DYING TO KNOW who decided bacon was a breakfast food: "In the 1920s, Americans ate very light breakfasts, so public relations pioneer Edward Bernays persuaded doctors to promote bacon and eggs as a healthy breakfast in order to promote sales of bacon on behalf of Beech-Nut, a packaging company that had diversified into food production."   TLDR: Bacon was established as a breakfast food to promote bacon sales... smh
Omg emma change so much after getting the drums!
thoroughly enjoyed ur cat in the background while u talked abt breakfast food
Thank you for setting off my Alexa lmao
what I really like about Emma is I always feel like we're hanging out and having mental breakdowns together....
No Emma,we will literally never get tired of you playing drums it gives me a will to live
please house tour
Did anyone’s Alexa turned on when she said Alexa 20 minutes On the clock
Emma we have the same toaster twins
Emma should go zero-waste for a week
emma: 🥁 me: 😌
Lmfao you’re so funny I love it
after she said she didnt wanted to use the Lords name in vain I gain a new level of respect for her.

I’m waiting for Emma to stop being vegan😐

the alarm clock gives me anxiety
not me getting healthy meal ideas from emma chamberlain
Jesus christ it's like I'm watching myself
emma has inspired me to play drums
i am honestly so proud of drummer emma
Why did my Alexa set a timer when she told her Alexa to set timer?
Emma you can watch korean drama if you nothing to do Drama suggestion:- while you were sleeping
Girl I have indigestion aswell, ain’t it fun 😂😭
"I hate being roommates with myself" Never heard something more relatable in my life
I actually paused the video and took a shower
Did she finish the soup?
Emma, you are so pretty❤️
you turned my alexa on smh
ok but revamping ur Spotify playlists does hit different when ur bored I can attest
i need to learn how to drive, thats all i need to solve my problems
so in conclusion i cant wait to live by myself and get forced to go out the house by my lack of food
emma you seem like you’re not feeling too well but i’m really proud of you for putting effort into doing things that are good for you ❤️
Whole Foods is the best 🥰
Nobody: 3:54 Emma’s cat devouring the tap:
why did i get stressed out when the alarm went off
she looks so good when shes just chilling at home ...
i feel like emma smokes weed. no, i hope emma smokes wee.
Please post a recipe of your soup!!
Did she say ily as is I love you and pronounce it as ily and I heard that or am I hallucinating?
i want emma to do tiktok fashion trends or try to make outfits from emojis lol
this is so sad i literally watch emma's videos on repeat to feel like i'm hanging out with her
I took the shower advice & also had to tell my Alexa "no" when you told her to set a timer for 20 minutes 🤣
im so glad im not the only one who like does the stuff she does like im not weird see emma does it too ...... shit
Thank you for forcing me to shower
its the fact shes still doing smth successful and im just doing the lazy version of her day
12:21 first time ever hearing Emma talk like that, CUTE.
You Pretty All The Time !! 🙌🏻❤️ #emma
Emma everything will be okay! You should consider talking to a therapist if you haven't already. You seem kinda sad and like ur going through it. You are awesome don't forget it!
emma is absolutely me living alone 😭😭
You cursed a lot I don’t like you
Brb I'm about to have a shower
K I am actually relieved to know I am not the only person who has mental breakdowns randomly all the time😂😭I just recently started watching you but you are so amazing and I love that you are just you if that makes sense🥰
5:59 glad that drumming makes you happy
If you think about it GOAT sponsors Emma and pays her then she spends her money there on shoes so it’s an endless cycle of paying eachother ™️😋
😇👁👁
WE LOVE THE DRUMS NEVER STOP
i genuinely do pretty much nothing all day wtf
Emmmmmaaaaaaaaaaa, love ya
No me había bañado durante estos días porque #depresion y esto me ayudo a hacerlo. Gracias 💜
Emma started drumming. She changed :]
3:30 cctv-... no big brother is watching you 😂
The border collie line just sent me
hey emma!! if you’re not native maybe don’t refer to a meeting as a powwow!! that’s not what a powwow is!! it’s a culturally insensitive thing to say!! byeeee
I love emma and everything about her ❤️❤️

"Alexa 20 min on the clock" my alexa: YES MA'AM

my alexa went off when u said “alexa 20 minutes”
❤💋☕I love youuuu!!! Literally just ordered 2 of your mason jars!! Me and my daughter will be matching and I'm so excited!!
Emma: ....... Me:*inspired as FUCK*  Le mom:bitch wut -_-

I seriously love you Emma but I’ll never understand why you cry so damn much haha
Emma is my comfort YouTuber and I feel so much better after I watch her videos

Cut your hair shorter
peep the white claw in the fridge
she eats so healthy without effort I could n e v e r
Not a emma vdo without a burp 😂
Emma: res pepe, recipe

I feel like she needs friends to just sit and watch true crime with.... or something
i feel like now all her videos r the same... its getting kinda boring
Whats that sound in her intro?
I dont like breakfast foods either so good to not be alone
u should learn disco beats on the drums! look up "four on the floor"
I now have an alarm for 20 minutes set up
The second face looks like balloony from phineas and ferb
I feel like I'm watching the same video every week, over and over again, but I just can't stop.
Emma, about the breakfast thing I'm from Italy and we drink coffè ( not like yours tho, only coffè and not milk) and we eat biscuits, granola or fruit. And also a lot of us don't have breakfast 'cause we start school / working really early
i would've made a "dads kitchen" playlist but idk my dad
Where is her limbo sweashirt from?!
Welp, there's a 20 minute timer on my Alexa rn
the second face drawing looks like dr. Doofenshmirtz’s balloon from Phineas and Ferb 😀
BACON for breakfast propaganda brought to you by edward bernays - nephew of sigmund fraud - https://youtu.be/nj_UWbifM2U also great uncle of marc randolph (co-founder of netflix) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Randolph  welcome to the  R E A L  world  =P  BONUS bacon bits  -  it's alleged that sir francis bacon spearheaded the group who wrote shakespeare's literary canon and king james translation of the bible. but there is no connection to  kevin bacon
nobody:   me watching emma chaimberlain and playing mincraft cause my teacher didnt show up to class
i’d LOVE to see emma try to make an herb garden.. don’t ask why? only if emma wants to of course. if she doesn’t want to it’s okay, emma you’re enough.
i love emma so much ❤️💗❤️
I thought the adding other colors to the person was a good idea tbh 😂
Easy recipe for you to try that has melted vegan cheese! So we do chicken quesadillas (I know you're vegan so sub whatever is appropriate for chicken, or just do "cheese") anyway, so I make gluten-free, dairy-free quesadillas.   Ingredients:  whatever tortillas you prefer vegan cheese taco seasoning (I make my own) Chicken (optional)   Instructions:  Warm tortilla in a skillet on the stove. Flip it to the other side. Layer vegan cheese, sprinkle taco seasoning over all the cheese, add black beans and protein. Add a smidge of cheese just enough to get the tortilla to stick together. Close tortilla, keep on one side 3-5 minutes, flip. Keep on other side 3-5 minutes, done.   I hope someone else who uses vegan cheese finds this useful 😅 i hated using it until I did this recipe. It literally tastes like queso when melted.   Emma you could stick your breakfast burrito in your new toaster oven thing to see if it melts the cheese!
Your so interesting and fun! Dont forget to drink water when your mood gets... abstract lol
you should pull an all nighter
the cat drawling was fire i dont know what your talking about
Emma, God loves you! He has a plan and purpose for your life. Just wanted to encourage you. Also, I love your YouTube videos. 💕
20:58 the cats is taking over the channel and I’m here for it

Hey Emma, ​​you'll be a Harry styles drummer
Love you so much
literally, the alarm sounds in Emma's videos give me severe PTSD of highschool when I had to wake up at the ass crack of dawn to get ready. Like literally it makes my body hurt.  I literally quake. Petition for Emma to change the sound (:
Hi I love u bro
How did she got that rich?

“no one is allowed to talk to me for the next rest of my life” 😳❤️she said it for me
She's looking pretty ❤️
Emma in this video is me every single day
Wait, you eat eggs?
“Who’s Emma Chamberlain” a unique individual who can even manage to entertain us with her grocery haul :) love you emma ❤️
That alarm transition sound gives me anxiety :(
Love the drumming content
No but really Emma I swear you get funnier as the weeks go on. Like frl you CRACK me up and that’s why I watch you
i literally after this i went to see her podcast and i saw one called ‘life burnout’ and i kid you not i could relate to what she was saying in the podcast and i got up to the part where she said ‘i am only doing this just so that someone can relate’ and said out loud without thinking ‘ i can relate to you’ and then still while listening to it i started to write everything that is being stuck in my mind that needs to just be emptied on NOTES and it made me feel good because i am not the only one who can relate to what she was saying. (that had nothing to do with her video but you should listen to what she was saying on her podcast)
Not me having to tell Alexa to cancel the 20 min timer
plz post the soup recipe
CAT IN SINK 4:11

I love how she has lime white claws in her fridge
I love how she has everything I desire and we are still going through the same shit. A friendly reminder that you don’t find happiness and fulfillment in things and fame
Y’all are talking about emma can we talk about her cats they’re such a vibe
Emma is the literal most reliable person and such a mood.
My Alexa heard Emma say the 20 min timer and it scared me 20 min later 😂
I love you
I love you

Nobody:   Emma: My hair is short, so I have to put in texturising spray or else it looks like I'm a border collie
my alexa set a 20 min timer....
Emma! Here is a idea for your air fryer! Cut apples in half then in a separate bowl put soften butter brown sugar and cinnamon! Mix it up then put it on ur apples. Air fry it, then eat it!!!!! ITS SO GOOD EMMA TRUST ME!!! (And vegan) ✨👑💖
My wife
How do you buy a toaster when you don’t even know how to use it?! 😭😂 EMMA WHAT R U DOING
I need a second video for this week to distract me from my breakup
3:45 Edward Bernay decided it was a breakfast food during the Industrial Era in the 1900s. He made it know that eggs and bacon was All-American Breakfast.
Things To Do Today  1. Put Pesto on my eggs 😭
“see ya next week bitch” ily 🥺😂
I honestly love when a new video of her comes out because of how she videos her life is literally how all of us act and i can't even... Go Off Sis
Emma, you should try M E D I T A T I O N. Love You so much!
When you said the Alexa command, my Alexa set a timer for 20 min 😳
01:56 "it's mAssive" - Kim Taehyung

"...I'm just thinking about the future of my soup..."  🤣😭🤣SAME!
"Heyyyyyy my tortilla is moldy"
Love drummer Emma
I swear I was tripping cuz I thought the red fleece looked different😂 didn’t even occur to me it was a new one until she said it🤦🏻‍♀️😂😂
emmas dad: “you need to go for a walk or a run” emma: *no. a jog.*
Thanks for being so relatable :)
THIS WAS A GREAT VLOG EMMA made me laugh out loud multiple times
Make your own tortillas! I did that at my old job and you can make spinach ones they don’t even have a flavor. Just blend water and spinach pour it flip it bammm
Emma has natural art talent...or probably had a little bit of classes oe something because i can't draw like that
paint
she's literally like every other person and so real with us <3
Am I the only one who feels like she’s been kinda sad recently? 😔🥺🥺
That’s the drum beat from Sharp Dressed Man by ZZTop but none of these kids will know.
I cut my hair short once too during a mental breakdown, and even the hair stylist tried to talk me out of it because I have a heart shaped fat face but I couldn't be dissuaded. I really thought I could just magically look like Sailor Mercury by cutting my hair, amateur mistake... I didn't take a selfie for months. dead socials. but honestly yours doesn't look anywhere close to as devastating as mine... yours looks pretty good. I mean, I can tell you wanna grow it back out so do it, but it's not literally the ugliest thing in the world like mine was. lol, you always look pretty though.
Loveeee youuuu
This made me want cauliflower
she looks like hugh grant with her glasses on hahahaha
TAKE UR CATS FOR A WALKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
i have NEVER had a mental breakdown so SUCKITUPEMMA im kidding but i thought id tell you that ive never had one hehe
ok but did anyone else see her cat go into the sink😂
Okay but we need that recipe for the soup Emma!!
Yo Emma. Drop that recipe for the curry soup! 😋
I use a buture knife
a snack i think you would like - Harvest Snaps (my favorite flavor is wasabi ranch)
Emma's cats😍😍
honestly I just here for the drums
i love how comfy you are!
Okayyyy 2 forehead kisses? Emma!! Thank you
That cat looks like mine 100% accurate
Wait, did you buy that Patagonia fleece off me? lol
I made broccoli in the oven...and I burnt it 🔥🥦
pro tip: always keep a backup deodorant in the car
I wonder if drum sales have gone up since you’ve started posting about playing the drums 🧐
احد يقنعها ان التغره ما تضحك تكفون
i was watching this vid and my dog decided to come sit on my lap and watch it with me i litteralky had to prop it up for him 😭😭
It’s so important what you do ! You not just entertain us but show how we are all in the same ship . Thank you for sharing who you are ! It’s enough and super amazing ❤️
"AlexAHH.... TWENTY minutes. On the clock"
hey emma i absolutely love you but can you not burp in the video i know you just like being real and unfiltered but it genuinely  makes me uncomfortable . please! thank you! <3
C'mon. How many coffee plantations does Emma own anyway?
GOD ANOTHER VEGITARIAN
the title 'everything went wrong' me: well.. - amelie rose
the history of bacon in america is actually really interesting, look that shit up man
Fun fact : avocado is not vegan
What about the exploitation of human labour in South America miss Vegan Princess and her coffee company? Don't you care about the exploitation of labor with coffee through globalization?    I abuse animals by eating meat? You abuse humans through the exploitation of labor
not enough of yall talking bout how declan is literally in the sink in the background
who else loves to see emma plyaing the drums like this
OMG i love your cooking videos SOOOOO MUCH there so funny LOve you XX
Full immersion requires you to sleep at 6:53 and wake up to Emma’s video in the morning.
Lmao you turned on my Alexa 🤣
When you said you sleep in a fleece.... Immediately I started sweating
why was her cat in the sink
i revamped my spotify playlists the other day too!!! it felt so cleansing. like I dived into playlists from hs and cleaned them tf out to make them better. highly recommend <3
im sorry but how does she go to the grocery store and not just buy 1000 snacks
I just noticed how nice Emma's teeth are and now I can't stop looking at them bc their so nice
Trivia Question: What is the painting ‘La Gioconda’ more usually known as?
My life resumed in one word: 20:22
https://youtu.be/Q9R.-yXXXwC8 Wisdom Follow Jesus Christ, he rose from the dead! Obey him before its too late. He is the only way to get to the Father John 14:6 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; Hebrews 5:9 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Acts 2:38 Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord: Hebrews 12:14 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy. Proverbs 28:13!
please do more fashion videos aaaaah!
I had to stop myself from cackling because she said this video is sponsored by GOAT and I’m like... Dote??? Is that you? WHAT IS HAPPENING
she's so pure and beautiful
Jesus I meditate more than I pray. I listen to the Dalai Lama. I catch wasps that get in the house in a jar and set them free. But I won't stop eating domesticated meat. Why is that so wrong?😫🙄🤯
ngl this video was a WHOLE mood 😂😂😂
I'm in love with that LV backpack
I think a mullet haircut would actually suit her
EMMA if you can make soup you can make your own tortillas! It's really easy and they taste soooo much better. Check out Joshua Weissman's channel for a good recipe, his Chipotle But Better video specifically :-D
Hickey?
when she yelled Alexa my very own alexaaa went offfff hhahhahaahhaha
“I’m sorry I didn’t mean to say his name in vain” idk I thought that was nice of her to say
I think it’s cool that Emma is vegan but eats eggs. I do that too
5:55 I feel u
All of Emma's cooking vlogs feel judgmental
But the Cow is Sacred 🐄
“I’m sweatin mah boalls oaff”
Ok but this video was perfection, like cat background when she was having her breakfast, playing drums, a good amount of sarcasm ,we love her don’t we?
Emma you don’t have to try to look good, you already do
So true about sharp knives
Ngl you're really like my happy pill🥺🥰☺💓🥳
When she said "but I don't even have a alexa" 😂
that soup looks good! pass the recipee please
3:53 YO WTF IS DECLAN DOING BACK THERE??!?!
ur cat is stealing the spotlight
not me leaning forward when she gives a forehead kiss lmao
I think she is suffering from pig withdrawal symptoms 🤐
everyone: I just dont want to do ANYTHING  me: I want to do something but nothing interests me 😁👍
Emma sees air frier and thinks to and oil?? What 😂
PLEASE KEEP UP W THE DRUMS FOREVER EMMA! YEARS FROM NOW I WANT DRUMMER EMMA TO BE THRIVING! 🤪😂
Just to confirm the drum break was fire😂💯
Any one else realize they need a shower but then like eh ill take one later😂
Emma, u manifesting the life u wanna live wrong. Ur a baddie so u need to act like it🧚🏻‍♀️period  You choose ur own reality
A company wasn't able to sell enough bacon and eggs so they went to some old psychology dude and he said getting a bunch of doctors to recommend it as the ideal breakfast food would help spike sales and then it did. I don't remember the specifics but Tiffany Ferg did a video on it. It's called PR and Propaganda I think
we love a relatable, quirky queen
20:22 got me😂
Epic meal time baby. Time fo some pig 🐖
never stop showing us your drum skills pls
yea pretty sure the civil war invented bacon 🥓
Girl Acutane fucks up your mental health, it’s literally a side effect and people take it lightly. I had to take a gap year just to recover from similar breakdowns and attacks. Please take care 🥺
17:30 the first time emma chamberlain spilled her coffee. monumental. new york times wya?
emma : i dont like spirally tie dye also emma : wears spiral tie dye shorts
sis ur not gonna talk about ur soup for a quarter of the vid and then proceed to not link the recipe in the description......
emma you should make energy balls just google it i think you would probs like them & they're gluten free
I like ate 20 pounds of pork in the past week.
If u can't handle miss chamberlain at her worst u clearly don't disserve her at her best xxxxx ILY EM xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Am I the only one that believed Emma she made that soup by seen half of it spilled down the side of the container 😂
i’m having a party on saturday and i’m spending my friday decorating for the party. it’s just going to be me and my dog and maybe my mom will join but it’s gonna be lit🕺🏽🕺🏽🕺🏽
Take a vegan break from my meat Emma
When Emma said “ily” you know drumming changed her into another person 😂😭
What defines a mental breakdown tho i don't understand
Emma is rebranding and soon the skincare line will be a line of cookware. The planner will be a cookbook, and her coffee company will expand to snacks by the end of 2021. 😂 She growin w her audience
Maybe Emma should eat her cats like in a NYNY Chinese Restaurant
美女你好漂亮
Emma should make a video just dedicated to her cats
I mean this sincerely, like coming from a friend. I believe if a perspective is shifted to one of gratitude above anything else - it’s amazing what it can do for you mentally and even physically. This in no way means you are NOT grateful for all the things, but it’s easy to get lost in a negative space and forget.  Rather than dreading a task, dwelling on a bad mood, whatever the case may be- try and flip it.  Thank you Lord, I am so grateful for this day.  I am so grateful that I have a roof over my head today.  I am so grateful that I get to take a hot shower whenever I want to.  I am so grateful that I have food to eat today.  I am so grateful for my cozy bed.  I am so grateful for eyes to see.  I am so grateful for my health, for my legs to walk on my own, arms to hug my loved ones.  I am so grateful for my friends.   Easy ways to keep this perspective in focus is to put up post-it notes around the house, or even take an Expo marker and write them on the mirror! 🥰  Just some small examples that can make BIG impacts.  We love you sister 🧡
Posivitism is evil
DROP THE SOUP  RECIPE
i ate pasta for dinner
You know you're all grown up when trying your new toaster-air fryer gets you all hyped up.
Is this person ok? She has  serious natural vitamin D issues..☀... Stopped watching after 2sec due to feeling bad for her😟😟😟🙉👁

I've been eating pot stickers for breakfast lately. I get bored of normal breakfast foods too!
I love watching her videos so much because I relate on every single level. Lol
Emma is my medecine. 🥺

PLEASE STOP USING PLASTIC! REFUSE AND REUSEEE!!🌿

This is the first time Emma has spilled coffee over her counter, let’s all take a moment for this historical event.
watching an emma video always makes me feel better. thank you emma
Play more drums I love that!
Omg did i just heard mrs.emma chamberlain eating tempe?? Omg you should try the indonesian style and eat it with sambal (chili sauce) it tastes so frickin gewd
Is it really an emma video if she doesnt question if her avacado is good 😂 love emma
Emma, you should go hiking as a a part of your daily errand-mission ! It will make you feel 100% better to be out in nature during this lockdown, helps me a lot these days <3
You should sell your paintings and I guarantee because you grew it you would get like over £100 for it like yanno:)
If she thinks she is a failure what I’m i? :(
She’s the funniest ever. Start a drumming Chan
5:40 "And all I am is a man I want the world in my hands"
Goat ad *pause for cauliflower* Goat ad
Bro I love her
jsyk i did in fact pause the video, take a shower and come back. i needed that, thank u
You ever since Emma started playing the drums....she’s you know ✨changed✨
Any relation to actor Richard Chamberlain or  Neville Chamberlain who invited Adolf Hitler to conquer the Europe during WW2?
so ur just not gonna give us the soup recipe?¿
if you dont make a drumming account im shanking you
Watching Emma outside is healing!!!! I don't know WHYYY
CLEANE YOUR LENS EMMA!!
What do u use to edit
I keep cleaning my screen, and the smudge is on her lens🤥
Please stop using animal periods, breast milk, dead body parts, bee vomit as products. Animals aren't resourses! Please go vegan for animals, health, planet
Why did Emma give me hella Timothee Chalamet vibes in this video 😂😂😂 damn
I just checked out your "dad's kitchen" playlist and it's 🔥🔥🔥. Your dad raised you right with that magical playlist. Good job dad👏
I am living for the drumming in every video since you got the set 😂💕
Emma is the most comforting person to watch I feel like im watching a video my best friend sent me of her day sending u love BITCH
i<3 u
i cannot explain the boy and comfort you bring me when i watch your videos tbh
00:04 we love the iconic slurp
you should try dif breakfast foods from around the world bestie
Vegan cheese doesn't melt? dafuq
9:19 😆☠️
maybe emma should return to edit her video on her own, at least one time. i think it would be more spicy by then
ugh loving her drumming progressssss keep at it
you set off my alexa!! haha
The cats need to be in more vids
I absolutely loved that video
Imagine just running and seeing Emma crying and posting about it or something
i'm deciding i'm in a bad mood too idk
Good vid. I laughed
Emma: goodnight sweethearts   Also Emma: SEE YA BITCHES
The worst part about Emma’s vlogs is the ending😔
Not me being so mentally unstable that i started crying when she said “good night sweetheart” 😗✌️
Your not meant to put oil in the air fryer. A few suggestions of things you could make :  Hot chips and nuggets  Warming anything up There are many more, btw you could make a video about experiencing to cook things in the air fryer 🙂
okay but can we talk about how nice and helpful her dad is,my dad could never
we act the same omgggg
Ok but i love everything ab her and the drums spice it up
Lol I don’t think I’m gonna brush my teeth tonite .... haha she kills me!!!
I hope she’s okay.
Lmao you made my Alexa go off it scared the heck you it of me
emma can do the cringest thing but she makes it cool
Her Cats do be kinda thick thoee
Emma is going to become a professional chef on day
21:33 girl you turned my alexa on what kind of witchery-
Emma: Alexa, tWenTy minutes on the clock. My Alexa: Twenty minute timer, starting now. Me: ....
The end got me dead hahahah
One of my fav videos of Emma she's fucking hilarious every second!!!!
Ahahah is ur cat drinking out the tap
i can’t help but feel that emma should put more color into her home, i get that it may not be her style, but just more furniture in general could help a lot with stress etc. It’s a lot more difficult to motivate yourself to get up after a breakdown if you feel like you’re living in an empty home. her house is very modern and maybe it’s just me, but it seems like she’s just living in *a* house and not *her* house, if that makes sense. it looks like a ton of empty space in her house, and when there’s so much space people tend to let clutter accumulate since without it, the house would be more empty. (i’m not a psychologist this is just my opinion).  it doesn’t have to be an architectural masterpiece, just more comfy furniture and personal touches.
this was so perfect to watch if it was for 10 hours id watch it
drop the curry soup recipe
I love you 🤟🏼
Baconwaffles
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿😠😠😠😠😠😠😡😡🤬🤬

I am worried for ema she is too skinny
the fact that I paused the video and took a shower literally shows how much power Emma has over me:))))
Emma: "Showering together help us during our time of sadness and pain" 10:12 Emma: "I will pause the video and take shower" Viewers: (waiting for 10 minutes) 10:16 Emma: "I am out of the shower" 10:19

JESUS IS COMING  & HE LOVES YOU  Believe the Gospel and Repent ⬇️⬇️⬇️  “Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:” ‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭15:1-4‬ ‭KJV‬‬  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9 | KJV  REPENT: feel or express sincere regret or remorse about one's sin   THIS WORLD IS FULL OF SIN JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY !!!

Petition to have Emma chamberlain buy a Alexa😎
Emma do the tik Tok thing : use ur led lights like red or whatever and draw and colour and see how it turns out. It always looks so good I swear!
Actually you are good playing drums.
Okay, but WHAT'S THE RECIPE TO YOUR CURRY SOUP?!! Cause now I'm hungry😩❤️
I love the sweaterr its AWESOME!
Emma! You can also cook and fried broccoli and cauliflower with tomatoes.
random question: is Emma allowed to like tiktoks?
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming
Emma explaining the yelling good feeling when you learn something on an instrument is immaculate

eggs and bacon actually has its origins in britain lol
✨You are so beautiful ✨
the "see ya next week betch" sounded like that italian guy who cooks on tiktok @itsqcp i love him
the thing of deciding whether you're in a bad mood or not has to be a Gemini thing cause girl sameeeeee.
Why are there so many entitled white girls on youtube?
from a person that has played drums for around 7 years now your actually pretty good
I’m loving the drum breaks 😆
my love for emma after this video📈
There’s a quote that goes something like “stay close to the things you love and far away from everything else” play drums all day if you want! Who cares!
As a person from Netherlands the idea of bacon in the morning gives me bad vibes.. like yeah as a side for dinner or when you’re having a barbecue, but bReAkFaSt?!
she has only viewers who love her <3 thank u for making my days better after releasing the videos
5:41 did anyone else thought the beat is similar to sweater weather's beat?? no?? just me? ok.

Emma's channel is literally such a safe place, she is so honest about her mental health   Edit: 2:24 didn't Emma say that she doesn't like tie dye?
I feel like you shouldn't have showed the cameras when you were eating your breakfast, like in the back you can see the viewing screen .
Emma is the one friend I have, but she doesn’t know it yet. I do the same thing each day, feel the vibe of her life goes with mine.
LOVE YOU EMMA! XOXOXOXOXOXOXO

i posed the video and took a shower... Thanks emma (not kidding)
I love emma but this is kinda boring
eggs..... thought Emma was vegan.... hmm... ok
I just got my wisdom teeth removed and watching Emma’s videos is just so calmingggg
2:25 emma was wearing sister's merch shorts?

EMMMAAA IS MY SAFE PLACE LIKE EVERYTIME SHE GIVES US FORHEAD KISSES AHHHH I FELL SO LOVED
FINALLY someone agrees! I hate breakfast foods for breakfast. I skip the meal most of the time because I spend the morning running wild trying to decide what to eat and suddenly its noon. Breakfast is over 🤣 I can eat anything for breakfast. But breakfast foods feel like torture sometimes AT BREAKFAST TIME 😅
every time emma shows us new dream beats she learned it feels like a little child showing u a drawing or something
🙇🏻‍♂️
Emma n I are besties but she doesn’t know it yet🤫😜
Who?
ifffff u think about it shes just walking around talking to herself like a crazy person
A meat company made up the whole bacon for breakfast thing!
No one:  Emma: Squishing my sausage
Her kisses are the best
Emma swears so much less nooowwwwwwww
Emma: nobody is allowed to talk to me for the next...rest of my life. Me: MOOD.
stress relieving on the drums 👍
omg- my mouth dropped at her drawing why was it actually so good 16:24
2:09 why does her cupboard look fake..
17:40 wait if an og Dolans stan is in here, doesn’t that moment remind u of Ethan in that old challenge video???
Anyone else so happy that her dad just knows how to get her out of her funk 👌🏾 it’s sweet
Emma is me asking if you need to add oil to the air fryer when the whole idea of an air fryer is that it DOESNT NEED OIL
Are there these little net bags to put your vegetables in there in America? In Germany you can buy them in the supermarket so you don't have to use plastic bags for vegetables that are not already packaged
i love watching emmas videos its like im  on a faceime call with a friend
I love that ur getting better at drums again like i can tell ur already at my level and ive been playing for a year

Imagine being so rich, that you can literally do almost nothing everyday. G O A L S
so we’re not going to talk about how during her cooking video she said....watch me get a air fryer like-
The new hair makes your eyes pop so much. Obsessed

3:52 :   emma : eating her food and talking Emmas cat : gimme some food bitch :/
Girl, was that a Panik attack at 17:40? 🥺
so much plastic.... ehhhh
Damn you gave me so much of negativity and I was in good mood before watching this video .... This is not what the universe needs right now Emma
Many times i find myself wanting to be like her, having my own place, having a fun job, being independent and all that....but at the same time i kinda feel sorry for Emma because i can't imagine how hard must be living by yourself, away from your parents at such a young age.  I really appreciate what she's doing but to be honest all i care about is that she is fine and feeling good about her and her life
just like Emma to start the video with a sip of coffee
0:01     me at 2:27am

Emma Chillin on Melrose like a Boss Your The Best Emma Love ya Girl..
why do people think its funny to burp?
you should do drum cover
In the 1920s, Americans ate very light breakfasts, so public relations pioneer Edward Bernays persuaded doctors to promote bacon and eggs as a healthy breakfast in order to promote sales of bacon on behalf of Beech-Nut, a packaging company that had diversified into food production.
ы
Carry on doing this sid
emma can u do a day in my life with frankie and declan <33

She lost the chance to say "they Goat it all" ok don't mind me here... just.. Scroll- bye

Oh Emma started drumming? She's changed...
Her drumbeat Daddy taught her was the start of the "Gimme All Your Lovin'" song from ZZ Top.  Yes it's 3:44 am and I can't sleep again. 🤦
Who else is going to buy one of the sneakers emma likes???
You should have shown us your soup! *i am so glad that cat are doing well, ...PETA is happy*
Yes, you can put the soup back into the fridge ahahah

“So now I can’t make my sooooup fuuuuckckkck”
the little “f*ck” after she forgot to get curry paste was hilarious to me thank you emma i love you
“Wait can you not stop in the middle of the road you stupid” + me = dead
her getting excited over her drawing just makes me so happy idk why lmao
i would very much love a curry soup recipe

Best thing in an air fryer emma is tater tots
???
I literally love you !! This is literally my inner dialogue it’s crazy!! This video is self care! Like seriously 😊 thank you
my forehead kisses give me so much serotonin
cooking with emma, wifey edition lol
emma start a band with me
also i get the feeling emma needs a drastic change in her life but is fearing all the judgement of the public eye... 💔 how sad would it be for someone to go their whole lives without ever truly being themselves, just because they were worried what other people thought. embrace you.
I’m 31 and it makes me feel better that Emma also has regular meltdowns 🙈
don’t google t boning on urban dictionary 😭😭😭
i was distracted when she said her tortilla is molding and when she said hey i answered like i was in a ft w her lmao
i want a target vlog
GIVE US A FRANKIE AND DECLAN DEDICATED VIDEO
I just realised I’ve never actually seen emma sit in her living room.
the forehead kiss. precious. i lean forward every time
it’s funny i’m realizing how you feel during your mental breakdowns is how i feel every single day lmao
anyone feeling like she only does these videos nowadays because she has to do the sponsors
Does America have like F45’s or gyms like that? They literally cured my depression. Running sucks, I don’t know why she inflicts that on herself.
PLZZ were is that grey LIMBO hoodie frooom??
Aye yayaytayaytay
3.47 emma : talking  Me : watching the security cams in the back   Lol
That official outtro was everything
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
Something about Emma’s videos is so comforting to me. Feels like a friend is with me😊 it’s also refreshing that she vlogs even when she’s not doing too much - makes it so easy to relate 😊 we love you Emma xx

How can anyone living in a warm climate be in a bad mood? I live in a dark fucking pit with 5 hours of daylight and constant rain, wind and snow. I have the RIGHT to be in a bad mood. If you could look out my window you's be too!
this girl has a monitor in her kitchen that shows 12 security cameras.
Love you Emma I love your vids and podcasts sm 🤩 please don’t over work your self and take care <3🥁

I love how Declan is just chillin in the sink and later with Frankie in the sofa ❤😻
emma: 'am i gonna be in a bad mood today?' - relatable, on an extreme level.
i hate being like this but i get so FRUSTRATED when she plays the drums out of nowhere. sorry emma, i love you.

Needs me sum Chamberlain Coffees
Emma: “ literally shut up, everybody shut up” Me: 👁👄👁
For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4   For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 2 Peter 1:16   And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 1 John 5:20   Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2   If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 1 John 4:15   In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5   I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one. John 10:28-30   Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12   But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. Isaiah 53:5   This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 1 John 4:9   My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. John 15:12   If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9   But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1 Peter 3:15   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Colossians 3:15
“Hair is not a question, hair not even a discussion” okay Emma with the rhymesss
why are these videos so entertaining
I had a pretty bad day today and ordered food twice cuz that's my way of cheering myself up. Lol
Be best.
Showered and I’m back :)
To the people who said “Emma isn’t relatable anymore” shut the fuck up, she is every one of us, the most unrelatable thing about her is that she keeps her avacados in the fridge and I don’t
Emma: HEY ALEXA I actually don’t have a Alexa  Me: Your a Millionaire how-
10:18 who else actually stopped and showered?
this is now my favorite emma chamberlain video. Literally ever.
This was my sign to take a shower today
how'd you.. know. i wanted... a .. grocery haul..?
Hi emma !! I'm from Indonesia 🇮🇩 and I'm telling you that tempeh is a traditional food from Indonesia ! I'm happy that you enjoyed it 🖤 it can be cooked to more variety kind of food and you should try sometimes 💗
how'd you know... i wanted a... grocery ᴴᴬᵁᴸ
you saying let’s shower together made me actually get up and shower for the first time in a while
Okay but who DID decide bacon was a breakfast thing? Who decided to put it in desserts too??
"thing is .. think about how much YOU have them"     oh how the turns have tabled..
show us how you make your soup drop the recipe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ok i took my shower:)
EMMA!! you should try deep frying those Broccoli 🥦 ( dip em in eggs then some flour mix with salt then deep fry it )
im so proud of her haters were always like ew she doesn't cook edible food she messes up she's gross now look at her she's cooking like a chef GO EMNMA <3
the insane energy in this video CURED me and made me feel less alone THAnk you 💕
She never swears anymore
Emma is a life
I swear if she gets a cut she’ll bleed coffee 😅😂😂
If only she knew how much she truly does for my mental health........
Emma having a mental break down is me every week.

CEO of burping
I really loved your latest podcast episode
Hi
“I cried, two people walking their dog saw and it was beautiful” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Emma I love you so much and it really bothers me how fucking bored you are. I think you should go back to school and take some online classes. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOOSE??? You are so smart so just go for it.
ur drumming is low key not bad and I KNOW my drumming
Can we all just take a moment to check out how fucking dope her security system is? Lol #goals
The whole begging of this video gave me Willie Wanka from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory vibes.
Yep I like you a lot idk if that’s bad
I love how open Emma is about her breakdowns because then it makes me feel more relatable, it’s OK not to be OK sometimes!
I adore you Emma
Logan paul could kick your ass! You better watch out and not get pregnant you dork
Ngl the drum beat her dad sent kinda sounded like Sweater Weather
emma: "...sharp knife...listen if you're under the age of 10 you didn't here me say that" also emma: curses HAHAAH ily
nobody:  emma: call-EE-flower
HER APARTMENT IS SUPER GOOD..
Wait I thought she was vegetarian... she ate bacon??
Samantha Schreiber and emma need to be friends they do similar things
I wish I could just take care of your hair for one day Emma, because is a simple and beautiful hair but you make it look impossible I swear!! Conditioner, then brush it with your fingers, press the tips up to give some texture and when it’s a little bit dryer put some oil on the points! Let it dry naturally, and LET IT DOWN!!! pleaaaaseeeeeee

HAHAHA when she talked to her Alexa at the end my Alexa started a 20min timer
twist the top of the posca pens you don't have to use the scissors anymore. yw

I love you so much
Me starring at my cat: What?  My cat: 20:21

Can’t wait for her “I started a band” vlog 😫
"im just gonna put on some oil and hope that thats enough" PLEASE MAKE THAT MERCH
You’re my favorite person on the internet
The bow goes to my heart “she’s cute😍😍😍”
10:29 is that a hickey?😱
If you're reading this, please smile :)
Vegan people eat eggs, emma is a vegan right??
if they do a new girl part 2 PLEASE BE JESS
don't know why i'm just realizing how satisfying the audio edit is for her coffee slurp at the beginning of every video..
LMAO SHE SET OFF MY ALEXA 😭🖐️
breakfast food is literally a social construct
Emma: Good morning everyone!!  Checks time... it’s 1:30am  Me: I guess 🤷🏻‍♂️
I can watch emma do nothing and still not get bored
i love how whenever i watch emma's vlogs i genuinely feel like I'm on a facetime call with her and we're just hanging out
Jason Was Here
okay emma do a crib tour
um i may have. i may have just taken a shower because miss chamberlain told me too JWEJIDKXS
Sigmund Freud’s nephew Edward Bernays basically tricked everyone into thinking of bacon as a breakfast food when bacon sales starting going down by getting doctors to say that heavier breakfasts (aka bacon and eggs) were healthier
The way these videos help me mentally, I feel we’re all living the same lives nowadays😂😂❤️
i love how comfortable u make me feel everytime i watch ur vlog, literally feels like hanging out w a bestfriend🥰🥺
I feel like I'm watching 3 years ago Emma's video. Like with the brown hair
how r u 14 on trending ugh ily
Try to mix with a stick mixer a banana, avocado and yoghurt, it´s the most delicious, the finest, the most wonderful breakfast ever
Can we just talk about how pretty Emma looks without even trying like she is so pretty❤️❤️❤️
Dude. We should really be friends.
Beautiful  ❤️
Emma get a fucking van and go on a road trip Yolo man you gotta get out of LA

Emma how can I become u
"Can we just get the light right jesus christ" ahahah love youuuuuu😂💖
Does anyone know where I could get that “greetings from limbo” sweatshirt? It’s fire
Who else identifies with Emma Chamberlain.. No but for real thank you for normalizing depression. Showing yourself at your highest and lowest normalizes brings in reality to everyday life. One of the least tone deaf wealthy youtubers. Gemini tingz😘
Now this is what I call a vlog!  Taking us along with you throughout your day ✔️. Making us feel like we're standing in the same room as you ✔️. Acting like we're BFF's ✔️.  I could watch Emma all day!! ♥️
No one  Emma: *being good at playing drums bit also being simple with it*
WOW VAPID AS HELL UNFOLLOW
I really hope she’s okay
Also cut my hair short I completely understand the feelings your going through feels like I've got someone to lean on if that makes sense ☺️
Hey guys! Follow for couple content 💕
I didn't pause for shower but DID pause to wash off my facemask....sooooo same??
LOL
Emma calling me a BITCH in the end is the best thing ever, thanks for making my day :)

LMAOOO emaa you're so fucking funny "Emma has changed" no1 said that ? No 1 said that 😂 lol love u
emma's my favorite lonley being😘
Emma you forgot something on the end part
EMMA u could post the same vlog every day and I would still click also you could never brag about you druming cuz I love it sm!!
You should use your air fryer wit veggies and blend them into a soup😋
Emma is getting so good at drums and also her dad sounds a lot like mine!!! :)
okay im not crazy but the moment emma released her video of her cut hair/ new hairstyle my hair was alrdy cut, and the moment she posts a vid abt us having to shower i actually needed it.
HER LIFE IS SO COOL LIKE THE PALYLIST NAME AND THE STORY BIHIEND IT AND HER AUR FIRE THING AND HER BEING ROOMATE WITH HER SELF I KNOW MOST PEOPLE THINK IT’S BORING BUT I THINK SHE’S THE COOLEST PERIOD.
" ok bye, SEE YA NEXT WEEK, BITCH! "
Ever since emma started playing drums she changed 😔🤞
This was a GOOOOOOD one. Thanks for existing Emma. You make life better. 😘🥰
in Indonesia, we usually fry the tempeh... it's good, you can try it that way
tryna slide that curry soup recipe over to me😔
Can you drop a soup recipe 😝😝
got bored watching this. sorri
" so now i can't make my soup, FAWK! "
no one:  emma looking at her camera: i know what you little sickos want 😙😏😏
Can we normalize crying while going on walks and jogs in public because sometimes it just feels right
Anyone else actually pause the video and shower?
Why am I the same human, damn she’s just so relatable
the alarm sound will always scare me
* new york/ jersey * " i'm fucking sweating balls off. "
her videos literally make my day
not trying to hate at all but if you tried to have a more positive mindset you might be happier
I noticed something  She doesen't lose her voice anymore like it happened years ago she would always lose her voice  It's bc she doesen't scream anymore she's not that hyped
Freeze your veggies before the go bad when you buy too much !!! then steam from for only a couple minutes to leave a crunch 🥰🥰
20:21 and the fact that it says 2021 lol
drum beat wuz dope... more drums more drums more drums don't hafta become a drumming channel, just make another (Utube) drumming channel.
Emma: cooking for others makes me nervous Also Emma: TRY MY SOUP BITCH
Like we can see she's going through it. Good job sis. We are inspired to be like you rather then be in bed 24/7
idk why brunette Emma reminds me of Timothee Chalamet, i think i have a crush on her now lol.
Thanks that was so good Emma omg. Lots of good content. To many relatable points not to laugh the whole time🤩😻🙂🌟😅
emma: ohwaooooh my mum: whats that noise
I catch myself trying to shorten everything and I’m like this is not who I am
im literally eating eggs for breakfast while watching this
That sponsorship clip was hilarious and so on point! 😭😂
Malk milk is THE BEST ! your reaction was exactly the one I had when I tried it for the first time !
Emma: ITS 80 DEGREES OUT WTF Me, a Canadian: *googles F to C so I can understand how hot it actually is*
I love when shes so proud of her self bcs it makes me proud of myslefs when i do anthying thays shes doing to
I like her drum breaks! I love seeing people have a passion or at least have something they enjoy doing... you know what I mean?! 😝✌🏼❤️
When I was vegan, eating a bunch of soy would put me down for a day.. it can block the thyroid = adrenals = that happy place of vigor * Blueberries, parsley, spinach, probiotics do the opposite - get me out of bad funks
" all purpose seasoning - that i just inhaled into my nose. "
Emma sounded like Trump
emma i’m like genuinely so proud of you.
whos alexa also went off when she wanted to set a timer lmaooo
“the future of my soup” 😭😭
Emma: plays a drum beat My brain: Sweater Weather????
puts on face oil, " mmhjjyughfhtyvj. "
Emma should definitely start ending her videos as dramatically as she did in this one Edit: lmao thanks for all the likes
I think Emma is soooo pretty 💖💖
omg tempe
Okay but is it time to talk about how she has different colored nails in every single one of her videos yet?
-i had a breakdown. -she said while plumping her lips
did you put hot sause on the burrito ?? 😌
am I the only one who leans their head for every forehead kiss? anyone? no
anyone remember when emma had acne and now her skin is glowing
EMMA WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR FLARED LEGGINGS I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF COMENTS BUT IVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A WHILE AND I WANNA GET SOME REALLY CUTE ONES AND YOURS LOOK CUTE SO PLEASE WHERE DID U GET THEM:,(
You look so beautiful!💕
Wow first time watching Emma Chamberlain, and I was more entertained watching this vlog than anything else I’ve been watching
Is it bad that I'm mad that she doesn't want a roommate cause i wanna be but I'm uh.. 13  ...
"because i had a mental breakdown yes i did" thats what im saying every time someone asks me why i didnt do something now i love it
you should put your cats in the vids more
We stan a discipline queen who has a routine set down packed
I love that sweater for you
Drop the soup recipe
No cap I love Emma's personality
I would be so scared to look at my security cameras 24/7 lmao
Go to college bru
You make me nervous the way you cut avacodos... 🤪
when are you joining a band???
Emma you are just amazing, thank you for this real energy. Keep doing you bc you rock.  Much love for you em😘❤️
"Let's re-CHAAARGE!!!" 🗣 lmaooooo
“nobody is allowed to talk to me for the next rest of my life” lololololol 😂😂
I 🤍💯💋💨
Emma was so funny in this video haha I’m sad she’s feeling sad lately but her humor in this really popped off
starts the video: crying ends the youtube video: smiling
That feeling you keep getting is the fact you don't have a job. I'm not trying to be mean, but it's true. Having a job teaches you things,keeps you active,gives you something to do/responsibility,keeps you accountable...the list is endless. I'm not saying a job doesn't make you feel like shit sometimes but I think Emma should actually work somewhere
the forehead kisses are actually so wholesome omg
Just had my first breakup and the forehead kiss made me want to cry
need WAY more vlogs
Emma buy the kfc console 👁👄👁
When she said to pause and shower I did and not I feel better. Thanks Em
Emma is legit the most adorable person on Youtube. 🥺
I enjoy watching your drumming progress so don’t stop
Man i love going back an forth from youtube emma and then podcast emma. Its like im a part of her life. Thank you emma. Bless your soul
5:15 yes i very much do know what you’re talking about
omg yes literally every morning I wake up and try to decide if it’s gonna be a bad day or not
Just showered right when you told me to ngl thank you
these vlogs make me happy
We need an entire video dedicated to you playing the drums!!
Love the drums, she has improved (I'm a Drummer)
Living for drummer grunge emma.

I read this comment from her previous vlog, saying Emma's not playing the drums for real. like she's faking it 'cause they can't see her playing literally. then, there she is, slaying the drums. now, to that person who commented that, you suck sir! with all my heart.

emma encouraging everyone to get up despite whatever inner demons / depression they’re battling is the kind of transparency i’m looking for - thank u for that and being you ✨
Is it just me or does Emma have to be more creative like her videos are getting repetitive
I can't be the only one that recommends her going to therapy
I actually did pause the video and go take a shower when she told me tho. Needed that thx lol

Vegan cheese don’t melt what’s the pointtt
Is it weird a 47 year old male New  Zealander likes watching you? anyone else think so???  I feel weird! , although I did tell my daughter to check out your channel , haha, her face was priceless, she was thinking WTF!? while also knowing I got her into Grimes and so many other artist back when they started ' so she also maybe thinks I'm not too weird.
the smudge on ur lens is a mood
I love emmas vlogs, feels like im facetiming her
Who watches this crap?
14:15 wait I'm so confused, that's an air fryer? Isn't it an oven? But I'm also pretty sure she said it's her toaster just now? HUH?
DID ANYONE SEE FRANKIE ✨GLICH✨  AT 4:13
“Can you not stop in the middle of the road you’re so stupid” - felt this on another level
Emma why do you look like caliou
I’m literally just here watching her cats in the background

Y'all don't understand how much I wish I had the freedom to have a rebound day after a mental breakdown. This is my ✨night time routine✨ ok so I come home from work, have a mental breakdown almost every day then go to bed, wake up the next day and do it all over again and act like everything's fine. It's a really good cycle, it's not aging me rapidly or anything, I don't have eyebags, or a twitch, or stress rashs, or grey hair at 20 or anything... Anyways just ranted sorry 😂
Stop putting the alarm sound it physically pains my soul
I also play drums guitar and bass
Why I low key love this new color on Emma

“What if i cook something?”  SIIII NOOOO  9:21
Forehead kisseS AND drumming progress, thank you sweetheart! 🥺 - a proud bestie

I love GOAT! and great drumming!!

Bacon became a breakfast food in America because of a marketing campaign. Pork farmers needed to find ways to sell more pork so they had doctors endorse bacon as a good breakfast food and the rest is history ✨
PETITION FOR EMMA TO START A DRUM CHANNEL
anybody else just watching her cat jump into the sink
Everytime I watch Emma and she is cooking immediately I am ✨starving ✨.
7:15 be nice to yourself!!! 💜 And let’s pretend your channel did turn into a drumming channel. Guess what, it’s your channel. Do what makes you happy 💜
am i the only one concerned this girl literally ate a handful of cauliflower and called it LUNCH
You are such a beautiful and strong girl , you should not be having mental break down again and again , just please take care of yourself and please keep going and I want you to be with someone gud.!
I love you
Were you just casually wearing pajamas? For the entire day? THATSAMOOD

Hey Emma I hope you’re doing good. <3
I'm a girl but like ...why I'm a simp when she's druming
The “see ya next week bitch” got me 🤣
Miss girl drop the soup recipe
I'm just waiting for Emma to shave her hair off... like a blonde buzzcut
im cleaning my room and playing this and all of a sudden i hear emma go “FRANKIE!” and i yelled “what?!” because i thought my sister was calling me 😂
We got the same toaster oven for Christmas 😌
I love how she said “we can try it all together” like we were sitting next to her😂
Stinky stinky stink stink
You forgot the tortillas 🥺
I didn't wanna comment on the last few vlogs in case it was temporary or I jinxed it but no...Emma's voice is back. It just is.
idk why im laughing so hard when she said ILY HAHAHAHAHAHAH "ILEY"😭😭🤚🏻🤚🏻
You know you’re adulting when you get excited over a toaster lol
20:20-20:24  MADE ME LAUGHH
if miss girl emma wrote a cookbook, i would instantly buy it... just sayin
Emma should create an intro with her own creative drum beats! :)
Was there not a protectant seal on the nut milk?
Must be so nice to have mental breakdowns and be able to be home and not be at the nursing home where you work. No hate to Emma just hope she knows how lucky she is.
Not trying to be weird but I definitely tilt my head for the forehead kiss every time. 😂
oh so u touch ur cats, i’m ok w that
emma is so effortlessly cool and funny without trying 🖐️
I really needed everything about this video lol living for the outro
ok
i love u so much wtf
Idk why everytime I watch Emma’s video I get a sudden urge to get my life together.. girl you need to post more often😂
This video is amazing!!! 😂
bro I want that goat sponsorship uhhh
You should do painting with your dad that would be a really cool video
anyone else actually go up for the forhead kiss
I CAN'T WAIT FOR EMMA TO GET TO 10 MILLIONNNN YAYYYYYYYYY   DIS GON BE LIT
okay tip for drawing: my favorite art activity is drawing something like a picture I see on IG but without looking at the paper as you draw. and then color it all fun after
no one: emma: i decided to paint a pickle because I was sad and bored
Emmaaa 👏🏽💪🏽🔥🔥
THE NAPOLEAN REFERENCE YES
5:14 Love emma sm that made me  wheeze 🤣🤣😂😂
Thank you for sharing your experiences with mental health. And cool that you are using music as a form of entertainment and healing! <3
i know this dramatic ass title don’t mean shit
Every drummer that does know how to drum is only seeing exactly what they go through that THEY don't normally show. They all go through the mistakes, you just showing them
Edward Bernays a public relations dude campaigned a long time ago for bacon and eggs to be breakfast food then ever since then they were.
honestly emma, if you were to film a vlog of you doing the same thing every day, I'd still watch it, because I feel the same exact way right now :'D at least we're all in this together.
May we please have the recipe for the soup and tips on making it please!
Emma is not ok atm
lil tip emma lift your heel on your right leg so that ur leg wont get tired :D
next week you should make some avocado fries in the air fryer.
there's some Timothee Chalamet resemblance before she went to bed if that makes sense
Btw Edward L. Bernays made bacon a breakfast food
You should try Art Therapy...release your feelings through art :) I think you would enjoy it ❤️
Not me wanting a drum set to have drum breaks 😂
emmas the big sister we never had.
Um why did she use a spoon to eat the cauliflower???
anyone else notice what looks like a hickey on her neck 🤭 no judgment just something i noticed
When she gave a goodnight forehead kiss I literally felt my anxiety melt away
i literally had a mental breakdown day today & when she said "goodnight sweetheart" I NEARLY TEARED UP LOL I LOVE HOW SHE MAKES ME FEEL LIKE WE CAN HAVE MELTDOWNS TOGETHER
why is no one talking about the fact that emma is actually really good at drums
Who else’s Alexa activated?? 😂😂
Emma’s energy is on the same level of a child coming dangerously close to falling down the stairs repeatedly 😂 and it gives me anxiety and happiness at the same time
I got an airfryer too!!
I love Emma but why WHY does she look like a white frat boy at the end
i feel like in this video emma is expressing to us more about how bad her mental health really is. is no one else concerned that she has literally no grocerys in her house? what does she eat all day? and she takes days to shower and doesnt even want to brush her teeth? shes clearly depressed and i dont know why but i really saw through her in this video. i feel like she also feels sad because she doesnt know what other kind of content to create. she has the same ideas and cant think of anything else. i feel like she is alone and its getting to her. i wish i could help
Like can we love her eye color for a second like...I love them
Emma!!! let me teach you how to play the drums!!!!
i watched it while having mental breakdown anyway
So proud of emma and her soup
you said "alexa' and the one in my room heard you and set a timer 😳
Ok who is this perfect “Thing” doing in youtube I wish I could take her money and give it to my parents,lame you tubers 1
I love her forehead kisses so much lol
emma is the most relatable person ever also the only thing that makes me less anxious is listening to edit audios and pretending im a badass it boosts my confidence
Emma playing the drums is a whole thing
ILY BUT PLEASE STOP USING THE IPHONE ALARM SOUND I CANT HANDLE THE TRAUMA 😭🤚🏻
we are just literally watching emma break down while we break down as well, but she's getting rich <333
uhhh the idea about putting on the mask before the shower....kind of just changed my life...drastically
If Jessica Day was a youtuber, she'd basically be Emma Chamberlain
we are just literally watching emma break down while we break down as well, but she's getting rich <333
can you  drop the recipe for the soup?
the forehead kisses make my whole day
I touch my cat at some point of the day too 🤣😏
Emma a think you need to start getting into the good good🌿🌿🌿
petition for emma to get a black cat and go against this phenomenon of avoiding adopting black cats because ‘they don’t picture well’.    doubles as a petition for emma to become crazy cat lady... pls....
We love a cooking channel 🙌😭

Emma you motivated me to cut my hair so I did it and I hate it so I kinda hate you even tho it’s my fault 🤦🏻‍♀️

You need to go to school or get a job, this is no way for someone to live. You don’t do anything.
“Good night sWeEthEaRt” Me watching at 6:39AM:👁👄👁
Emma should try psychedelics lol
I feel every second of Emma’s videos but @6:04 was the one for me
I love you but holy cow, what a boring life!
when she gave me forehead kiss i felt really warm inside :) <3
american breakfast: eggs and bacon filipino breakfast: FOCKIN HEAVY FRIED RICE WITH EGG WITH EVERYTHING

I hope you never quit YouTube
EMMA THIS COULD BE USEFULL:  get urself a water proof speaker for u to play music on the shower so u cam make it enjoyable
i always wait for the forehead kiss
As someone who only knows how to play drums as well as you can: good job!!! That’s awesome!!!!
i think her tortillas are moldy!?
your SOOOOOO close to hitting 10 Million!!!!!!!
PSA you can keep tortillas in the freezer! They keep for a while and warm up instantly and it tastes just as good.
✨Hey Emma your beautiful ✨

Make the second drawing into merch 😭😭
“Sometimes it’s good to not be cute” honestly, yes.
Hi bestie <3
Ok the drumming is kind of my favourite thing though?
Learn to play Cherub Rock by The Smashing Pumpkins.  It's always my go to that makes me happy.  I'm not good either but you will get the basics and as long as we keep trying then hell it's good enough!  It's really fun to play!
She is so good at drums 🪘
im head bobbing to her drum beats
I rewatched this 8 times already!
“Is virality a word?” Cody Ko and Emma Chamberlain worlds collide
Woke up, had a walk, saw Emma's video ......... Morning=P.E.R.F.E.C.T. We love you so much emma!!!!!💚
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Amen. Repent and turn from sin! Follow God's sacred 10 Commandments! Time is running out..
18:30 I was legit thinking she looks so pretty here!! also i don't get why she thinks she looks bad with rosy cheeks cause I think the complete opposite

Emma buy a chess playing set so you could play against yourself when you don’t know what to do with your day
hahahaha i have mental breakdowns every hour i can relate HARD
Ur videos make me 🥰🥰
Emma, practicing drums tip. Slow it down. Once you get the rhythm at a slower pace, speed it up. K love u byeee
I’m so worried about you
The way I KNEW this bitch is a Gemini without even knowing. And I looked it up and was right. Big Gemini energy
I appreciate your honesty with mental breakdowns, crying and mental health. This happens to many people and its normal. Like can we please normalize having mental health days and just taking care of ourselves after?? Anyways, love u queen
emma, make clothes, that it, take a pair of scissors and some thread and a needle and make some diy clothes  take a BATH not a shower  read that book   do some jump rope! maybe even without the rope   organize your underwear/sock drawer   look up recipes   go on google maps and search up random places   learn a just dance, dance   watch bridgerton
Her skin 🤭💕✨
all of this is way too relevant for comfort
You can 100% reheat soup 😂 you can literally put some in the freezer, melt it and then reheat it

RIP my taughts of being with Emma . #bringbackblonde
Am I the only one that leans my forehead when she gives forehead kisses??
If you aren’t lame look at my name 👀
I’d have a mental breakdown if I lived in that beautiful home and was a LV model too
Emma's cats r living the life
you should invest in puzzles
Honestly enjoy the drums 10/10
no one:  emmas cat: climbs into the sink (4:13)
I just did all of my math hw while watching this
i feel like i'm emma's psychiatist
Thank you emba for da forehead kissiess
For Emma to reference: ever since emma started playing the drums she changed
emma you draw better then me lol
i just got the bad habits face mask! And i love it so much! it helps my skin so much❤️
12:50 I wish putting on a new pair of shoes did that much for me
Please get another cat-
You should try acrylic pour it could be fun and help out when you get stressed
omg wait the face mask hack is genius i-
I love the drums :)
You also have to get the tool to sharpen your knives so they don't get dull ♡ just a tip ♡ y'all thank me later ♡ adulting things ♡
But . . . She does basically NOTHING! How do you have a breakdown when you have a million dollars, no worries, and do NOTHING???
You playing drums is FIRE
"I hate being roommates with myself" same 😂😂
Not me taking a shower Bc you told me too ✌🏼
emma doesnt realize how much impact she has on my mental health. those forhead kisses are the highlights of my week. it hurts to see emma be so hard on herself
can we PLEASE get a house tour?!?!
get friendship bracelet string and make bracelets it's such a good waste of time
Bacon became a breakfast food in the 1920s when Freud's nephew started a marketing campaign on behalf of a pork company. Before that, people ate very light healthy meals to start the day and meat for breakfsat wasn't normalised in that way. You can look it up! Tiffanyferg also discussed it in a video about marketing to the masses.
kinda sad she didn't link the soup recipe lol
emmas forehead kisses r superior, lets b honest
Omgggg Emma I eat the same tortillas lol I’m obsessed with the almond flour ones 🤪🤪🤪
So pretty!! Love u emma😍💜
THISSS VIDEOOOOO WAS SOOOO GOOD
emma: if ur under the age of 10- why would 10 yr olds be listening to u say fuck every 10 secinds lmfao 🖐️💀
i thought her drawings were so good like the "lazy fast quick drawing" kinda feel and they were cool
Emma you turned my alexa on and I thought I was about to be murdered
KEEP SHOWING US YOUR DRUMS
Emma’s cats crawling around the counter in the back is literally everything
Emma if u add the vegan cheese in when it’s on the stove and mix it then it melts. But u do u. Also I figured that out after getting sick of unmelted vegan cheese 😂💛✌️
this is my new favourite video on the internet
Your videos give me life holy fuck
Tortillas!!!
Emma you HAVE to try this soup!!!!!!! https://frommybowl.com/feel-good-red-lentil-soup/ It’s sooooo good and SO easy. 12/10 soup
emma doing the same thing everyday its entertaining to me
Is anyone else just looking at her cats in the back 😂
IS THAT A HICKEY
I want another thrifting video from Emma
The way she illustrated the mental breakdown... ✨immaculate✨
U neeeed to listen to her podcast sooo inspiring
Hold up... air fryer toaster oven????
the editer try in to hid the cat in the backround 13:10
Emma telling me to go take a shower but its broken and im too lazy to take care of it👁👄👁
Emma no one is sick of you playing the drums your amazing, love you ❤
My favorite type of video
hello emma, i know you’re probably not going to read this but i just wanted you to know how much your videos do for people. tonight you have saved my life, my mental health is just disgusting and i was doing so bad and as soon as i started watching this video i immediately felt better so thank you.
I honestly feel like I'm hanging out with a friend when I watch these videos. Your videos make me so happy.
No one  Emma’s cat in the sink while she is eating😂
I think you’re thinking of t-bagging lmaoooo not t-boning.
EMMA PLEASE MORE VLOGS
When my college classes are stressing me out I just take a break and watch your videos. Thank you for helping me when i'm overwhelmed. Much love.
Who else kept watching Declan play in the sink? :-)
If ur soup have potatoes it will be bad next day
...stinky stinky stink stink
I had a mental breakdown while watching your video. You help me so much Emma thank you for what you do.
I think why emma has all these breakdowns so often is because she lives alone. Sometimes when you are alone with your thoughts for too long..you can think about unnecessary things too often. She should get a roommate. A caring one at that.
Emma: I shower, why does no one think I shower. Also Emma: this has been in my hair for 3 days now and I guess I have to wash it
i need your sunglasses where are they frommm
Emma is a mood aksldjkasjdklasj
I honestly couldn't stop laughing while you were eating your breakfast burrito because I was so focused on Declan in the background, I honestly don't know what he was doing but he was so adorable!
why am i sitting in bed watching this video stalling on showering and why did she have to call me out so personally like that 💀
HEY WE WANT MORE COOKING WITH EMMA!!!
I love her with brown hair. Looks so natural and gorgeous.
I choked on my chicken when Emma said she painted a pickle lol   Thank you Emma for all your contradictions and the way you express yourself, you help liberate us all
ITS THE WET HAIR ON THE KNECK FOR ME. EMMA NO. 😂
is it bad that i go to drum parts all the time???
Me before my surgery watching Emma to be in a good mood
I appreciate the shower pep talk. I find it is the hardest thing to get myself to do when I’m feeling flat, yet yes, 100% it makes me feel a million times better xx
I used to think meltdowns were just a part of life then I got diagnosed and realized I’m sick in the head now after meds and therapy I have meltdowns maybe once every month instead of like 3-4 times a week. What I’m saying is that I hope if Emma has any serious underlying issues that cause her to meltdown she can get help
emma: LITERALLY EVERYONE SHUT UP me: 🤐🤐🤐
This isn’t hate LOL I love Emma but uhh does anyone else think her cats eat on the counter is weird😂my momma yells at my kitten when she’s on the counter😂
‘That’d be a fun activity actually’ is one of Emma’s favourite phrases 😂
"I'M trying to decide if I'm going to be in a bad mood today."  hahaha
I want the soup recipe !!
girl PLEASE make video of trying on different wigs
EMMA!!!! NON-INDIGENOUS PEOPLE DO NOT SAY POWWOW IN THIS HOUSE!!
The amount of serotonin playing the drums gives her >>>>>>
I get so sad when the video ends on the real
This is what I love. I love wen women are straight up with their lives. No make up (even though there's nothing wrong with wearing it) talks about their sadness and real emotions and struggles. And I just think in my head… man she's so different then other girls. All girls try to look super pretty and act a certain way and it gets old. I love Emma because she's so relatable. And I feel like she's such an inspiration <3
10:09 ...I actually did pause and go to take a shower lol and I do feel better. Thanks, Emma. See, your "everyday-is-the-same" vlogs DO make a difference 👍🏾
I loved this video because it felt like I was on FaceTime with my best friend
Call-eee-flower
my favorite foods are breakfast foods, i could live on yogurt parfaits, bagels w cream cheese, eggs or omlette w ketchup, fresh fruit, muffins, pancakes, breakfast potatoes w ketchup and oatmeal  i just felt the need to list all of that
A week vlog please ❤️  30 min
Emma you should make homemade French toast it’s really good it would also be fun to watch you make it lol
the alarm sound really hurt me
no one: Emma: im f***ing sweating my bwalls off!!!

emma really made my alexa set a 20 minute timer
these forehead kisses make everything better 🥺
*goes on GOAT and looks up the same shoes as Emma thinking they're gonna be a descent price* "$335" *exit exit exit😳*
emma is the only one who doesn’t gross me out when she burps
good content
emma can you please play your old intro on the drums
haha
Now I have to wait for another week
She’s so cute

Can you make a Soup recipe video
oooo tEmPeeEe
i really like drumming emma
I wonder what its like to be in your mind lol
https://youtu.be/joIBGJfJcXc
Can we all talk about the fact that Emma is the only successful YouTuber that doesn’t feel the need to brag or show off the fact that she has money and still remains humble even though she lives so lavish. Love that for her xo
Is emma bipolar because I think she definitely exhibits symptoms lol... no shade I am bipolar lmao
PLEASE NEVER STOP WITHH THE DRUM BREAKS
so negative :(
"Emma plays the drums? omg she's changed"
Oh my FUCK i literally JUST also got a toaster oven with an air fryer in it T W I I NZZ!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

More drums. Cannot get enough. Best outro to date. Love you b!tch. Oh an no worries about the mental break down. I have one like every week then recharge too. Totes healthy if you ask me.
emma is literally my favorite youtube to make me laugh ever 😭 she needs a meet and greet in new york asap
This was very similar to your old vlogs, I like
Emma: what if I bake something  me: YESS COOKING WITH EMMA  Emma: NO NO NO me: oh :/ nvm
Took you with me to the shower lmao
When she said she looks like a border collie I chuckled out loud lmao
Play the bass drum witcha heel up! Your shins won’t hurt
this video is an emotional roller coaster
She is having something like writers block lol i would literally watch her brushing her teeth tho 😂
don't eat mouldy tortillas bro
the outro was everything😂💕
i see that breville bambinoooo i make aesthetic lifestyle videos, check them out and let me know what you think :)
please never stop playing drums for us
emma.. ily
In Malaysia our breakfast is nasi lemak (coconut rice with sambal and egg) or sticky rice or roti canai...high caloric food because the people in the early generation need a lot of energy for labour work...
Who else actually showered when she did cause she gave me motivation 🙋🏼‍♀️
I just bought ur planner!💞🎉
Emma: Talks while eating her breakfeast  Me: Watching her cat on the counter
emma plays the drums, shes different..
I dont really eat in the morning. Emma is a whole mood lol. Let me decide if I'm in a bad mood today😂😂
am I the only one who thought her air fryer was in the fridge until she actually opened the fridge...?
Emma... you and I are the same human sometimes 😂😂😂
Hihi
is she okey ? her laugh kinda creepy 😅
I need to know where the pants are from
I love your  videos
Show us how to make your soup!
Play drums!!
Haha best i can do is hamburger ramen.

Emma:go take a shower *me just coming out of the shower brushing my hair*:👁👄👁
Can you show your drumsticks? I’ve never seen any like that
you're my queen
Emma: Here's your little forehead kiss teehee...  Literally Emma in the same sentence:  SEE YOU NEXT WEEK BITCH!!!

Emma.. we wanna see vlogs... and WE DONT CARE IF ITS THE SAME THING LOL UR ENTERTAINING ALL THE TIME
“We almost T-boned and not in a good way.”
oh emma started drumming, she changed
emma literally makes feel like we’re in a facetime together
Emma get some cloth produce bags! It'll cut down on your plastic waste.
u neeeddd aa roommate
Why was my grocery haul the exact same wtf
I think we should appreciate how open Emma is about her mental health, she's humorous with it but it makes me feel less alone. She isn't embarrassed to admit she's stayed in bed all day or that she doesn't feel like showering. This is my safe place<3
someone send emma a long blonde wig but a good one so she can feel fine for a little while
To the 1% that see this I am wishing you a happy safe 2021
Emma needs to read a book. That can occupy her for a while. I recommend the princess bride by william goldman.
Bro I TRIED SO FRICKIN HARD to get those dunks i- I HATE YOU EMMA😂😂😂❤️
Emma: nobody talk to me for the rest of my life.. The 5000 people in the comments: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
thanks for multiple forehead kisses 2day needed it.... love u bb
through all of emma’s breakdown her lips still are moisturized 👄👄
Thanks daddy chamberlain for helping emma feel better.

I’m glad you’re so open about your mental health because some of us really do be going through it. Makes me feel less alone
Shes so nice and so lovely!
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
Idk why but watching this vlog was extremely comforting
Ah hell nah Emma did not say let’s have a powwow. how racist and stereotypical my respect for Emma 📉
I liked the cat drawing tho lol
I’ve never commented on your videos but today we burped synchronously so
keep playing drums!!
I love the new outro yes bitch
she’s so good at the drugs 😍
New segment "Emma Drums"
made my Alexa start a 20 minute timer 😑
I am not the under age of 10 cause I am 11 so I mean..      Jk
THIS VIDEO IS SOOOOO FUNNY. GOLD. LUH U BAE☹️.
video idea: trying my subscribers’ drum beats (like we send them in somewhere)
" i know what you little sickos want: a grocery haul" HAHAHAHAHA
Does anyone else love how Emma dose the Forehead kiss 🥺🥰
Put tortillas in fridge !! Especially almond tortillas
Drop the soup recipe !!
Okay sorry to say this, but an air fryer IS a high temp toaster oven.
Tltr???
did anyone else pay CLOSE attention to the beat of the drums..or just me  4:25
EMMA PLS FILM YOURSELF AT THE GROCERY STORE
Sis, you seem severely depressed. Please consider seeing a therapist if you haven’t already. Take care of yourself.
reasons i showered today: emma told me to
omg i need that sweatshirt where is it from
Always feel like I’m on face time to a friend when I watch Emma’s videos ♡︎♡︎♡︎♡︎
I fucking admire youuuuu
“Think about how often you have a mental breakdown. It’s more common than we think”  Honestly she’s right, reflecting made me realize that it’s pretty frequent
More drums!!! Lovin it
emma you made my alexa go off😂😭
Is your current job “busy” enough that you couldn’t get some kind of part time job outside of the house that you might enjoy? Or maybe you could take a painting class or something that gets you out of the house a couple times a week? Or maybe you already do that. I don’t know your life. I’m saying this with the best intentions. I think it might help your mental health to do something you enjoy that gets you out of the house!<3
did anyone else hear the beat of the drums... or was it just me
You just motivated me to pause the video go shower and come back thank u Emma my greasy hair needed this
Emma everyone has always said sharp knives are better where have you been all your life?
No one:  Emma: ALEXA SET TIMER FOR 20 MIN   My Alexa: timer set for 20 min
Emma’s dad: go for a walk or a run Emma: nope bitch imma jog
I like how im also living that same life of just not knowing what to do except grocery shopping and cooking  - but the only difference is I have a shit ton of uni work to do that I’m just ignoring
so i guess its safe to say: yes, you WERE in a bad mood 😭
8:45 is that a hickey miss Chamberlain?
My Alexa came on😭😭😂😂
“can u not stop in the middle of the road you’re so stupid”... Sandy? am i in the fashion club?
Emma you should do a video about your cats like a q and a
emma with brown hair >>>>>>
Emma gives me teacher vibes I swear- gotta love her tho!!
ilysm emma

hey emma started drumming and she changed.
💫💫💫💫💫
I love the way she says "HIIIIIIIIIIII" ♡(≡^∇^≡)♡
Jesus Christ is our lord and savior
i thought she was a flight attendant for a split sec
It literally feels like your on ft with her
Hey Emma, you helped me get out of bed and shower and have a life epiphany and feel a whole lot better in this video and I actually feel like I’ve left the long slump I was in, so thank you and I love you!!!❤️
Not just the ppl that know how to play drums 😬 hahahahah
please start acting like dale from step brothers with your drums
mental breakdown? more common than you think!
emma: aLeXa, 20 MiNuTeS oN tHe ClOcK! also emma: i don’t have an alexa
I needed this.
You look a little more like Timothy Chamalet (idk how to spell his last name) with dark hair
me waiting to see what went wrong:👁👄👁
I just wanna say ty you telling me to get a shower when it’s been a bad day really helps
honestly i used to hate showering, but i would always feel so good after tbh and now i love it so much that its actually something i look forward too
I love your videos! Keep up the good work
Pretty please can I have that mason jar drawing XD xoxo. Would make me a very happy young lady
Emma: *starts playing new beat she learned* Me: "All I ammmmm is a mannn, I want the world in my handss"
Emma is forever killing it, BUT  if she waxed her eyebrows just a lil I think she would BREAK THE INTERNET. Anyone??
emma: it’s 80 degrees out me in mass: it’s 25 degrees out😃
what’s the curry soup called ?
3 forehead kisses?! the best start to my week!!! here is a forehead kiss for anyone reading and Emma (from declan & frankie) *😽*
You made me genuinely smile and laugh for once today and you have no idea how much I needed it

Love your views being at 777 the luck Emma that you hold
Why were the avocados so funny

I honestly love you so much....thank you for being you!
Yesss i was so excited i needed to see more of emma im soooo glad she uploaded
Oh Emma we burped at the same time 😍😂 i think that was a bonding moment
Don’t be shy, drop the link of the recipe
I’ve never related to anything as hard as the deciding that ur in a bad mood
omgshhhh i had a breakdown today tooooo
I don’t think it should be legal for someone to be this genuinely beautiful.
EXCUSE ME DID SHE JUST CALL HER MICROWAVE A TOASTER OVEN??
@emma I’ve watched almost all of your videos and I am by no means a doctor, but I would recommend looking into PMDD to see if your depression/anxiety is related!
now im in the mood for curry
emma will do one thing ONCE and say "this might be my new thing". i love it
Emma, to answer your question. The reason the “ideal American breakfast” is eggs and bacon is because of a man named Edward Bernays, otherwise known as “the father of public relations”. Companies would hire him to create promotion/ads, and he was always successful at selling products. Anyways, one time a company hired him ‘cause bacon (a new product back then) just came out and wasn’t selling. By that time, the American breakfast was usually something like oats for breakfast lol, so no one was buying it. Then, what he did was he made a newspaper post an article saying that 5,000 doctors at least agreed that you needed a HEARTY breakfast! And so the eggs and bacon thing was created. It was literally all due to capitalism. 💀🤚🏻
First of all, the cats in the background are gold. 👍 Second of all, I live for her hair in the first part of the video. Why can she make messy hair look so damn good, and I look like a crack head? 🤔
Play more drums!!!
I love watching her she makes my dayyyy uhhhhh
I wish I could spend my day figuring out what to do all day
✨Emma Chamberlain is such a vibe.✨
Tips for playing drums! learn songs! learning songs are a essential part ! I recommend learning a lot of green day songs since they are in 4/4 most of the time and they're just really fast! Led Zeppelin songs are really fun to play too a lot them are in 4/4 as  well only like about six or 7 songs aren't in 4/4 but still fun !
I have this cooking this this fryer u don’t need oil just but food in.
Emmaaaaaaaaa can we see more drums????🥺🥺🥺🥺
hey my day went to shit today too. im right here with you emma.     p.s love the extra forehead kisses
it seems like youre in the middle of a manic episode
I’m proud of us! I did yoga today and took a shower
EMMAS PLAYLISTS ARE LITERALLY AMAZING
anyone know where emma got her umbo grey hoodie ??
gosh i love emma so much
she is such a gemini and i am fucking here for it 🤎
I feel like the poor version on Emma chamberlain. LOL
You should try getting out of your comfort zone where you do something different the entire day than from your original routine like try something different for breakfast , different kind of outfit you wouldn’t normally wear , differently hair style or something like that 😅😂
Need more of those accents Emma 😂😂🤣
anyone elses alexa set a 20 minute timer too?
1:24.....she just disappeared 😂
emma’s videos is probably the only thing that brings me happiness
Drum beat was INDEED dope
Checking if food isn’t spoiled yet when you live alone, is too accurate 😂
More vlogs plz
I LOVE WHEN EMMA PLAYS DRUMS🥺😍💖
Old Emma vibes, loved it
“Sorry i did not mean to say his name in vain”  *respect* 😌
I could listen to you play the drums all day !!! Please please play more drums!!!! 🥁

Emma I’d like to personally thank you for posting videos on Sunday because I never know what to do on my Sunday
Emma really spoke to my Alexa

*Emma we're here with you through the 100 mental breakdowns, and no we'll never judge you for them like those walking their dogs might've. The fact we see you like this literally with no filter, helps many....hope you find stability and smile more this year*
2:19 -2:23 I DIED🤣🤣
The avocados had me ded 😂

“Is that pesto in those eggs??? Ohhhh it’s asparagus!” - Bill Burr

What the hell is air fry
I love Emma’s forehead kisses🥰

Emma once again carrying youtube on her back
*Emma playing drums* Me:🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗💃🏽🕺🏽💃🏽🕺🏽💃🏽
Ok Emma you can’t just tell us about this awesome soup and NOT GIVE US THE RECIPE?!?
why is it telling me this just posted now ...
Okay but I want that curry soup recipe it looks so good
the fact Emma actually got me to get up and take a shower
Also was Emma trying to not swear?
omg i eat tempe all the time its a southeast asian food
Not me having anxiety that she might not give me another forehead kiss
its an ✨air toaster fryer oven✨
Love you Emma!
MAKE VIDEOS WITH YOUR CATSSSSSSS
Emma: Yoloooo Me: Big summer blow out
2 videos ago: "Watch me get a air fryer"
I actually took a shower and came back
tempe? the one that made from soy beans?
Watching Emma eat helps me live so much you don’t even know
bitch really just made my alexa set a 20 minute timer
idk if someone has already commented this but the reason ur shins are hurting is bc ur using the heel down technique which isn't rlly used for rock grooves, so if u wanna stop the aching learn the heel up technique which will give u more control and make the kick drum sound more driving and powerful. believe me, i was exactly where u are when i first started drumming and i WISH someone told me abt the heel up technique sooner. u sound great on ur kit btw! :))
i just had the same day as emma. didn’t wanna do ANYTHING like literally nothing was kinda horrible but nice to see this video now:)
4:00 women  lol
shes reminds me a little of jesse pinkman from breaking bad 😂
No one : Absolutely no one: Emma: “Byeeeee see you next week BITCHHH!” I swear I love her so much she always makes me laugh 😂 🤣🤣
Y’all remember the Fortnite faze😭😭😂😂😂
pov ur alexa set a 20min timer😳
i would literally sell my soul to be her friend wtf
drop the souP recipe !!!!!!!
There was a smudge on ur lens EMMA
I WANTED THOSE DUNKS
not emma setting off everyone's alexa haha
Hey! Can you please link the recipe for the soup? I love curry!! ❤️☺️
Curry.....soup?
Emma: plays drums at 10pm  Neighbours: Are we a joke to you?
Omg I had two eggs left in my carton too #twinning
Ur cats are thirsty or they want cleaner water or they don't have access to their normal water
Aren’t you vegan
emma your so good at that drums
lol Emma can you not hear yourself? you stay yelling @ us.
no one  Emma-💥“fAwK!”💥
my tortillas were also moldy:(
Love HOW EMMA IS A CHAMPION FOR POSITIVE ENERGY & LOVE SEEING YOUR AVACADOS! LOVE THEM TOO ( YOUR FAN ACROSS THE BORDER) VEGETARIAN TOO💞💞😺cat owner too,, fashionista like you as well!!!! Your simply younger!! YOUR ENERGY TO KEEP POSITIVE IS FAB ! ITS SO HARD IN LOCKDOWN And boring,I do many of the things you suggest,like skin routine. It does help you. Cooking, I've never actually made soup yes you can freeze soup.....my older sister has & given it to  me ,thaw it out in microwave  Through it in a Tupperware container. It's fine,luv. Trust me. Hoping things improve for you  sweetie, Nobody deserves this. People ( trolls) are really attacking some YT online. I wouldn't unless it would be absolutely legit. I've never seen you do a thing. Oh. Except....... PLAYING THOSE SKINS SO DAMN LOUD GIRL!!! 🙀😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
besides that, why don't vegetarians know they're actually meat eaters too, plants eat meat for fertilizer where the (crap)do you think it all came from? but can't deny it it's more healthy if you eat it second hand.
You can use Siri for a timer
thank you for your sharing this lovely routine day work 😍
hey Emma. I like your drum sounds. pls do more thanks ✨🥰✨
this video gave me INSANE 2017 vibes!
I think that in England they also eat bacon btw 3:57
To answer your question, eggs and bacon breakfast was created by a pork company to boost the sale of bacon. The owner persuaded doctors to promote it as a healthy breakfast. It was a marketing campaign. How America is that?
She should try doing viral hacks
This is the most beautifully chaotic Emma video I’ve seen. Love u queen
ILY EMMA!💖💖💖
I love your short hair!❤️
i love you  so much I also love running errands we both do the same thing everyday
This is HANDS DOWN my favorite Emma video
Who else has been watching Emma since she started😳 old Emma love her but new Emma I still love her🤍😼
Emma: tells me to take a shower Me: actually does it  THE POWER THIS WOMAN HAS MY GOD!!!!
you being mentally unwell is 1. so funny but also 2. so comforting because i get to see you feel things we all feel and cope with it in healthy ways
When she  touch,,,, my cats I thought she was going to say “myself” 😂
its honestly ok to have days where you feel like doing nothing,your not a failure your human everyone has days like this and its normal,i struggle with motivation sometimes,just take things at your own pace,but running and the exercise is good!you got this
Is that a security system on your kitchen wall?!  Woah
somebody got heads up, tipped off the store so they could close for when she got there,,,,,,why?
no one: Emma: I hate being roommates with myself
Who actually showered when she did?? Aka me
Emma should start a band 🙂
I love it: "I need to shower, but I don't want to' 'I need to wash my hair, but I don't want to' I  love your blatant honesty!!!
Ppl always think their lighting in the car is bad but it always good lol
I feel like Emma will be such a great therapist-
emma, just a reminder that i love you, we love you. you are loved. 🥰
Hey I’m concerned for you, please consider seeing a therapist if you need help
emma can we be friends we are the same person
this so funny. I luv u for that xo
Emma are you okay? 🥺
Lol, my eyes keep shifting from Emma to the cats 😂😂
the alarm sound in the middle of the video triggered my fight or flight
"aLexA ²o mINuTeS oN THe cLoCk" "...but i don't have an Alexa" Im dead😂
Hey people, I know this is annoying but I just started a podcast on my channel if anyone would like to check it out <3
I'm just saying, if you don't already , you might need some depression meds
I find it weird how she ate that with a spoon n not a fork I would have used a fork
Am I the only one but I love her drumming it sounds so good and I think it’s cool her showing us
live
Don't trust you! and always be ready near the alert's bell and or notification icon for your melt downs thank you for the update. :)
the fact that u always have meltdowns and breakdowns comforts me because same
omg in massachusetts it’s 20 degrees 😬
Girl, you don't have to worry about the next thing or to constantly come out with the new new. You need to be able to take care of you and it's minute by minute with mental health, i know. We're here. You keep on that train of mental health. Your drumming is definitely awesome. You don't have to be good at anything to enjoy it.
Fuck get rid of bellbottoms 2021!!!!
Why do I love her and like just want to be her bestie 💅🏻✨🥴🪳
I'm confused, do guys watch this channel to or is it just girls?
I was not in the mood to exercise either
Isn''t the point of an air fryer to not use oil?
I just went on the site to see if they might have some Jordan's I found like months ago but couldn't find them anywhere and this site had them! Thanks I'm getting them
Emma's whole channel is an ad for whole foods
Your videos make the Sunday scaries go away 🤩
Did that second drawing look like that balloon from that random spongebob episode to anyone else?😂
Emmaaaaaa give us your soup recipe plssssss
man. even when you have 9.8M, look fucking fire and hot (DW im gay) and have success and a beautiful house and cats and money... still spent the day having a mental break day in bed. its so incredibly relatable and realistic im sorry you are going through that. it sucks. sending love from new zealand queen!
Emma you need like a dog, to help you like ik u have cats but dogs are like the answer to not having a bf.....
I was watching Dani Calleiro's video and she was saying she's going to do something everyday so like movie Monday, tidy up Tuesday etc and I think it's such a good idea especially during quarantine when we're doing the same thing everyday it's something to look forward to!! 🥰
I love when we get a glimpse inside her fridge
She Vlogged 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 5:58 - could not relate more to this sound 9:23 - 9:30 - also mf me Omfg also THE BEST SOUP I’ve had was at my local co-op and you KNoW it was Tofu Curry - DELICIOSO👩🏽‍🍳🤌🏻
Need that curry soup recipe ✌🏼
When you said to pause the video and go take a shower, I did it. That was the motivation I needed for today. Thank you😋
okay but why do i feel like we’re besties anywayyy bye
I've realised she's the female personality version of Timothee chalamet
Emma's cats make me want to adopt a cat even though I'm allergic :D
me just staring at emma’s cat while she eats 👁👄👁
You should try switching up climates. I don’t know much about the states but isn’t like Oregon a forest-y place where you could stay at a cabin near a river or something? I know it’s pandemic but if you’re being cautious, why not?
Girl, you need to see a naturopthic doctor or an integrative doctor for that indigestion!
she should've bought a drum kit so long ago hahahaahahah
<3
It's just like hanging out with a friend ❤
I love that she is always on the brink of having a mental breakdown cuz me to
emma i love your vibes in this video 😂
she is so rich yet so humble
"No one's allowed to talk to me for the next rest of my life" ... I am stealing this awesome quote.
The forehead kisses are my absolute favourite
I LOVE WHEN SHE POST SO MUCH THE NOTIFICATION MAKES ME SCREAM I LOVE HER
Ever since Emma started drumming she's changed...
5:40 sweater weather 😎
I GET TWO FOREHEAD KISSES??? I feel so special! 😍
i honestly look forward to the drumming interludes
😄Awww I’m a 40 year old Emma
Hahahahaha Declan in the background when Emma was eating her breakie was so funny and cute
Forehead Kiss to you too🥰
Can we get the soup recipe, or what?
you need to try the vegetable nests from trader joe’s!! in the frozen section
I wish i  could help you with the mental breakdowns 😣😢 your such a beautifull girl and your personality is so sweet and your good humor.. Im from Holland, if i lived in the same place i will bring you too the top were you kinda are already..only to the happy top its out there ..I hope that you feel better the next couple of weeks!! I know how it feels 😢  Love Melissa de Jong
My mom: take a shower  Me: no  My mom: seriously you stink  Me: no  Emma: poise the video and take a shower  Me: ok (takes shower)
Emma you should do a house tour
dude the cats were so cute
I actually just learned in my public relations class that this man named Edward Bernays was trying to help market a company along time ago I can’t remember what year and he put out an ad that told people to eat bacon and eggs with breakfast because it was backed by science that it was “good for you” and then everyone started doing it and that’s how it began lmfao
is that a hickey? :0
Can someone actually tell me what’s wrong with Emma like I got at the start of all this like oh ahah yeah mental breakdown we all get them but she has them like allllll the time and it’s actually un funny I feel sorry for her like is it LA that’s the problem or something?
Appreciate the extra forehead kiss xx
Can’t wait till she hits 10 millon
please emma stop giving us war flashbacks with that alarm noise😭
It killed me when she played the alarm sound😭
It’s so weird that if I think about what was this video about the only word that comes to my mind is nothing but I loved it. I mean I am the same age as you and I relate sooooo much to your feelings and you describe it so well. I feel like you are my soul animal.
Emma is really showing how we all should be acting going through a break up.
Am I the only one who actually showered 😂
the lil hickey thoo
It feels like we're on facetime
She’s my best friend and she don’t even know about that
dude i really fucking hate the alarm that u put at 7:33. It pisses me off pls stop. thnk you :)
Emmmaaaa loved you rectified saying His name in vain 🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️thanks babe!!! That was really sweet 🙏🙏❤️😍❤️😍❤️😍❤️😍
“I hate being roommates with myself”
Is Emma okay..who cries 3 times a day
I’m so sorry🤦🏽‍♀️😭 I disliked because I was bothered cause it was 299 dislikes so I made it 300 sorry not sorry btw no hate Ily
Thankfully you have more than one cat because that would have been✨awkward✨😆
I feel so connected to Emma. Like I literally cry with her, drum with her, shower with her, and talk to her whenever I watch her vids like in my head we’re besties
literally stopped and took a shower
Please tell me I'm not the only one who actually had a mental breakdown and then took a shower when she said so.
having a shower brb
I open at work so I take my lunch break at 9 am and I’ve been ordering lunch at that time cause I cannot eat eggs everyday lol
emma being indecisive for 22 fkn minutes is literally me everyday. she is me, i am her love my internet bestie<3
I love Emma's vlogs!! love, a small youtuber!
Don’t be shy drop the soup recipe🥲🥲🥲
EMMA UR HAIR LOOKS BEUTIFUL SHORT
Yes Emma yes ily
hi bestie
Don’t be shy, drop the soup recipe
The fact that I actually when you go take a shower when she said to pause the video and showere
I don't know if all your channel fans are ready for the full Emma. Anything Goes friends love you just the way you are, any day you pick to share. Good self help and dad advice on day 1. Your girl 1 is wonderful. Your dad always says his pencil sketches before his paint are deliberately quick. Girl 1 is your spontaneous natural skill. Forehead kiss <3
You should try bringing baking emma back!   P.s : we luv you<3
Emma just makes me smile.... and laugh to the point I have to hold it in so my dog doesn’t freak out 😂
I found Emma during the summer of 2017 and everything has NOT gone right but Emma *has* made these treacherous years more bearable. Any early subscribers from when Emma was still in private school miss Neema? She was the best.
Hear me out: Emma in a beanie
One should ALWAYS wear sunscreen!! Even if you’re staying in!
she’s so pretty and humble
love how she's lowkey dating role model...
Emma I wouldn’t say powwow.... it’s a celebration and saying it’s a meeting ...
You make me happy today😫💛
i love the drhms
I always watch her videos while showering 😭
actually, Bernays started a propaganda saying that bacon was good for you health and it started the american tradition of having bacon for breakfast
Ok this was an amazing video. It felt so endless in the best way, like I got to spend a long time with you. Love you hope you’re well
honestly just start being a volgger emma
—( Emma , you have changed since you started playing the drums, remember, you started playing at your Dad’s over the holidays,  “” you are getting good at drums and may become a “Performing on stage and have a group Rock Star””  ,  I can tell you are playing the beat better, I “” I listen to the beats that you are playing , “”  YOU SO COOL AS DRUMMER “”,  also  , remember cooking in the “wifey edition” , you said, “ something happened I’ve changed””, and you have , but most of all ,  I hear you consistently tell your fans, “ We are going to get through this”, and encouragement , “” things are getting better “” ,  the French fry comparison, “” It got millions out of the house and moving again  ! ! !

pioneer Edward Bernays in the 1920 decided that bacon was a breakfast food :) ILYSM emma!!
Emma do a game channel
Can’t be the only one who leans in when she is going to give us a forehead kiss
CAN WE HAVE THE RECIPE FOR THE SOUP PLS
omg you make your eggs literally just like me and people think it’s weird? 😂😂😩
Okay I need this soup recipe 😍
You may think brunette Emma is the same as 👱🏼‍♀️ Emma but she’s just a little more... *dark and rebellious.* A little more prone to mental breakdowns BUT she’s also a lil bit more rock n’ roll.🤘🏼🔪 🖤⛓🪦🥁
i’m getting in the shower
emma in the car is 💯% me
Jeez,....emma......r u speaking to someone cause minutes 6:00 to 6:06 was hard to watch

Kinda breaks my heart Emma needs all of those cameras for her safety...
I wish I had Emma’s clothes man. I don’t got that money doh
*I love how her cats are just casually in the background, and covering the camera at times* 😭
i took a shower because u told me to 😭😪❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
18:39 looks like emma gets it too
*This is gonna sound sappy but Emma makes me feel safe and comfy. She's so real with us, she's like my best friend. Love you Emma*
Anyone else notice the monitor with a thousand camera angles of the house😂
Emma = being realistic Others =???
wow ur so good at drums
I don’t like breakfast foods that often and only eat them on the weekends when I have time to make it lol.
Hi
no one  absolutely no one: me: if emma’s vegan.. why is she eating eggs? Edit: excuse my stupidness so apparently it’s considered vegan👍🏽 so i’m just dumb.
Can we get that curry soup recipe tho?
Did anyone else notice the smudge? All video? Hahaha
tell me why, when she gave a forehead kiss and said goodnight sweetheart, did I start crying. that's when you know you're emotionally deprived. lol
love you too!
thank you for uploading  you are literally one of my safeplaces idk but I feel so comfortable watching your videos
Her videos now are her just overthinking everything.........
Emma’s videos are the only thing that’s good to watch on YouTube the whole week
She’s wearing the pants!!
The cats are looking around like "wow this place is so clean and organized, Emma must be doing a video today". Getting ready for 10M guests.👑
authenticity unmatched
I’d pay money to have that drawing.... just saying (name your price)
emma i need the soup recipe
when I grow up I wanna be like emma. she is great!!
Ok but that tip about putting a mask on before you shower changed my life bcs I’m lazy too
I think you’re the best!  Loved the vid.  Emma I think you may be anemic!  I was and I notice you have some similar symptoms to me.  Have you had your blood checked?  Taking iron has helped me tons and I have way more energy
I have pow wows with myself daily.. lol
had the same hair, just put some hair mousse into your wet hair (best while upside down). Hope this helps :)
nesnasim reklamy, ale miluju emu 🥰
Meanwhile Emmas cats are like "Let me just sit here and stare into the sink real quick for like... an hour"
You should go zero waste
Whats with the eggs and vegan cheese?
Also Heads up, Can you clean your food before you put in your fridge like you have your bags on the ground you have a ride today would be some kind of will you read my message not well I hope you cleaned your stuff anyways
civil war:??????
lmao dude so much preparation and hype "to go out" and thEN ITS CLOSED
Pls make a recipe video for your curry soup!!
eats eggs, but everything else vegan.
You should make tortillas from scratch!!!!!!
under the age of ten u mean 2
I just love Emma’s cats in the background.
This video is so hilarious omg
i know she jus made like $1000000 from that goat sponsorship
EMMA YOU SHOULD MAKE MORE NUTMILKS!!! LIKE THIS SO SHE SEES IT
Emma: i dont want to shower or brush my teeth  Me: depressed and doesn't want to shower or brush my teeth but Emma made me feel better about it somehow and im gonna shower and brush my teeth now
Her followers should be called the little sickos lol idk how to spell it
whats the idea behind those special looking drum sticks? are they less noisy ?
use olaplex on your hair sis
I need to shower and when you said pause and come back I kinda wanted to do so but I didn’t so yeah
im not sick of the drums! :)
just letting you know that we are best friends emma :)
No one :  Emma: eats an egg w vegan cheese
Emma Chamberlain doing a New York accent is something I didn't know I needed until I heard it
Emma should learn sweater weather on the drums lol
Ummm miss Emma is that a hickey? Lol
The 😛 gets me every time 🤣🤣❤️
Emma here’s a new project you might enjoy: get those big colored buttons that you put on the floor for your cats and train them to understand what each means and then they can communicate with you it’s so cool!
period
keep the drum clips i’m fucking living for them😂💚
Try Clam add 1 teaspoon or 3 teaspoon of soy sauce cook on medium 20 minutes add coconut milk, tomato sauce, min corn cob or can corn simer low heat for 5 minutes soup.
i love how her cats are always there in the background, they are SO CUTE
Emmaaa we need your curry soup recipe :P
Emma i love u
emma ur hair has me at a loss 5:08
she’s so close to 10 mill😌
I hope you're doing okay. stay safe !!!
eggs and bacon was a marketing ploy from a guy who was related to freud !! farms/produce ppl were having a hard time selling bacon so this guy was like hm. could we say it has health benefits and a team of doctors where he worked were like .... uh yeah? and so bacon and eggs was advertised as such and then became the staple american breakfast
I'm sorry but I 've been laughing at Emma's little "fUUUccKKKK" (20:22) for the past 10 minutes. I litterally have tears in my eyes!!!!!!
saying "lets have a powwow" is very racist just a btw to avoid it in the future...!
bacon: was due to advertisement
The breakfast food in my country (The Netherlands) is just some bread with some sort of spread like jam or cheese also pancakes ain’t breakfast, pancakes are dinner
can you make your drumming your intro song?
Ouuu you should eat pasta for breakfast. I eat pesto and noodles for breakfast all the time lol
Emma needs to stop using the alarm sound it triggers me evry time
PLEASE DO AN ADVICE VIDEO because i need ur advice queen
Watching you cut that avocado I got the worst anxiety lol #dangerous
Bacon is definitely a food you can have at any point in the day
Girl you have to try out overnight oats for breakfast!
I don't think she realizes how attractive she is
Yo is it just me or did she hit the super holy fuck
Try leg compression sleeves if your legs get tired when drumming!
thanks emma i took a shower
we need a drum interval
Your security system is fye
your need to occupy yourself by coming up with a tattoo idea, DRAWING IT, then getting it. such gratification.
Im a drummer and I love the drumming bits. I also recommend you buy a speaker  so you can blast music around your apartment to avoid that empty sound that make you go into your head and thoughts. I do that and I blast some gospel music which allows me to do productive work that I need to do for the day. I hope this helps 🥰
MAKE A COOKBOOK💚
I heard on your podcast that you were running out of ideas for videos.. so I came up with 5 ideas that I think you would have fun with and enjoy...... (1) You could make a part two of you reacting to your old outfits. (2) You could do a Q&A and get questions off of instagram. (3) You could make another thrifting video ( we love those). (4)You could make a video of you creating a new pinterest board of just a bunch of random things. (5) This one is my personal favorite: you could make a video of you learning new drum routines/beats. Just wanted to help you come up with some cool ideas so that you don't have another mental breakdown lolz... love uuuuuu
i really enjoyed when she called us little sickos
Emma do a whats on my iphone 😂😂😂
emma's mental breakdowns have literally been me the past few days, and when she said go shower, i was thinking that I really should shower
ok but why does she play the drums facing the wall
maybe it’s time to get obsessed with fortnite again lmao
A vegan tortilla: potatoes with flour  I tried it its delicious and u can out it In on the  fridge
omg why do I always feel like I’m on ft with Emma when I watch her 🤭 😂
If ur this successful but don’t understand that u can reheat ur soup as many times as u want there’s a serious problem
Did u shower LOL.......or brush ur teeth that’s bad If u don’t Emma like bacteria plac emmmma plz brush ur teeth every night
That extra forehead kiss was very much needed thank you Emma xxx
PLEASE I NEED A FRIDGE TOUR !!!!!!
10:18 I’ll be right back🙄🤠
I aspire to be just like Emma one day, minus the bad mental health but ily💀  Also if I’m famous let me know because stupid YouTube doesn’t like to remind you that you famous in the comment section😐
no one cares if you   make vidz 💖
Emma started drumming recently and she's changed
WE HAVE THE SAME DISH DRYING RACK❣ #aesthetic

I love how Emma is just her self
Who else saw the hickey 👀

emma is my favorite person in the planet and i’ve never even met her

YAYYYYY
emma: talking  me: looking at her cat going in the sink
Make a video of you getting hair extensions!?🙂 that would be cute ! Love you queen
You and your dressings inspire me.
emma saying goodnight sweetheart just made me cry

Emma looks like that blonde girl from tiny pretty things lol
The title should've been:  Emma raging for 22 minutes and 11 seconds straight
Love ur videoooossss :)
She just gives me good vibes  I dont even care what the video is about i just like hearing her talk  😂😂💕😭
Thanks for activating my Alexa:)
Yo guys Emma changed after she started playing drums....
The best decision emma made in 2020 is buying drums it gives her so much joy
i have no shame saying that i literally paused the video to take a shower.
Ugh making me wanna make that soup
Emma are you okay? I'm sincerely concerned
I will always love and support you emma ❤
i love emma’s vlogs i always feel like we are facetiming
emma: Dijon mustard with chunks in it, dijon mustard without chunks.  me watching the video: ooo variety
Emma should live with somebody, right?
to be in 80 degree weather when it's currently 30 degrees by me :/
Is Emma aware that when she talks to her imaginary Alexa she always sets mine off 😂
This video is oddly funny. Needed that❤️
i love your videos sm
“No one’s allowed to talk to me for the next rest of my life”                            -Emma Chamberlain 2021
All the cameras in the back
I’ve never tried avocado like ever in my life, cuz it’s not available from where im from

Unwrapped a pen w a screwdriver 🪛 😂

Emma’s videos always turns into Emma’s therapy session
I seen that drawing on ig & i really liked it too 😍😍❤
someone get emma a comal please
Don't eat moldy tortillas, just don't, anything you put in it will be ruined. Also you are correct about needing sharp knives.
Loved this vid. Yes to drawing. Makes me feel so chill too. Thanks for the reminder. Xx woo woo
The amount of times Emma said my name not knowing I am alive hurts
No lie Emma just does it for me, whenever I'm feeling down she is my go to YouTube.. Much love Emma all the way from South Africa 🇿🇦
Never wanted a soup more than I do now
emma your my best friend even tho you don’t know it yet
Girllllll you were going to place the tortilla in the toaster ?????? Maybe it’s just me being Mexican but girl invest in a comal lmaoooo 😘🤌🏽

'Goodnight sweetheart' 🥺🥺❤
Emma must be a chef .. period
I love you Emma 🥰

Join a band, keep drumming
I actually do lean for every forehead kiss.
You’ve gotten so good at playing drums wow
omfg I lent in to where Emma was going to forehead kiss me goodnight and it felt so real omfg my little brain is humbled and happy 🥺❤️❤️
¨Can you not stop in the middle of the road. You’re so stupid¨ in that accent just sent me lmao
Emma just makes my day better I swear❤️

I LOVE THE DRUMSSSSSSSSS
Pls go on omgele next vlog
Emma’s videos literally cure my anxiety🤎
im subscribed from south africa
Emma I will never get sick of the drum breaks!!
I LOVEEE your short hair🥺
no one:  emma: 😐ok queen i know
Psa, I dont think non-Native Americans are allowed to use the word "pow wows" in the way that Emma used it (although I know she wasn't trying to be offensive). Indigenous people find it offensive since it refers to a ceremony.
EMMA PLEASE take the 16 personalities test and let us know what you gettttt plsss
We love you
ily Emma bestie I hope your feeling better <3
9:56 my sims when I put the speed on 3x 😂 literally that’s what it reminded me
hold up your face mask shower thing is so smart
The virality
I feel like we could be besties
Do you ever find at Whole Foods you go to buy one Avocado and leave with a $45 dollar grocery bill worth of pointless crackers, dips, and snacky items?
I LOVE YOU EMBA
ok so i'm at 10:17 and i'm gonna go take a shower ill brb (5:28pm) <-- time check  (edit) i just got out of the shower and i didn't think i took me that long (6:00pm) <-- time check
20:22 your welcome 😂
Emma has a hickey😳
God I love you 😂💕💕
She has been through phases of getting hate and criticism and you can tell that that has only built her character more.
"Those new shoes makes me want to run errands" = " Capitalism makes me want to capitalism" ...... sorry Emma, haha dark humour?! .... love you.
We want cooking with Emma vegan cookies edition back
Can you do a cook with me and drop your recipes!
I love her energy in this video SO MUCH!! Just brightens my day and makes me feel better
yo this made me feel like I'm not alone and I needed this ❣️
.
literally me putting in the least effort to breakfast to get it done
Which gloss does Emma use cause her lips looked extra plump in this video
im so obsessed with emma . i cant handle it
I laugh every 5 seconds of this video she makes my day
In the 1920’s, A pioneer persuaded doctors to promote bacon and eggs as a breakfast food.
I love just watching the cats in the background.
emma:  “i know what you little sickos want you guys want a grocery haul” me, wanting a grocery haul: 👁👄👁
Emma you should do a series of cooking/trying food from around the world. 💗
what if she adds a drum cover in the intro????? that'll be EPIC. Also LOVE YOU EMMA MWAHH
Emma darling i feel you! That why i come with a seggestion : You should download this game to your laptop , its amazing and passes the time - i got so into it i spent 4 days straight playing it and i wasn't worying  about life for a second there Its called :" Gray matter " I hope you see this and enjoy it to. <3<3
ommmgg i finally get to see a grocery haul from emma. its my favourite thing to watch hahaha
emma i love you so much the point of the air fryer is to not use oil oxkdjxkdcksj but i’m glad it was still good
Emma: does absolutely nothing Me: this is the best video I've ever seen
Yes, you had a meltdown, but have you ever thought about filming your podcasts?
I literally took a shower when she said to take one and its literally 3 am. I've been feeling so unmotivated this last week and didn't shower for a week straight. I'm so proud of myself 'cause I actually got up from bed and took a shower. So, thankyou emma. 🥺🥺🥺
I love seeing your drumming progress hahaha
Am I the only one watching her cats in the backround. 😂
Hi Emma, this is love: 👻
SOME DRUM TIPS: - Use your wrists not your arms, eventually you will even start to get a finger technique  - Play the kick pedal by pumping your heel, not your toes   - hit the high hat with the tip of your stick, not the neck, only use the neck for accented hits - RELAX    These are important because you want to make sure you have the right technique before progressing so that you don’t learn bad habits, and it makes drumming SO much easier!   You will be 🔥 in no time
she made my alexa start a 20 minute timer
r u ok
I love her so much 😂😂😂 and can we talk abt how good she looked in this video? Like she looks healthy and like she’s livin her best life 🥳
The little forehead kisses makes me feel so safe 🥰 I LOVE EMMAS SECTION OF THE INTERNET

I need the soup recipe
I really don't mean this in a judgemental or horrible way, but maybe it could help if you spoke to a therapist or doctor. If you have felt consistently low and have struggled emotionally for a long time, therapy or antidepressants can be so helpful.
emma please i beg play something on the drums. just one full video of the drums where ur wearing a fire fit and playing something dope
My dads kitchen 😂
me but im the title of the video
I would watch a whole video of Emma drumming💙😂
i played drums for a year (i suck now tho lol) and i must say that you are good! you have a solid, steady beat and you've desynchronized your body really well so far

But did you find your phone?
the way i’m so comfortable watching you do nothing omg
but with you everything went right
she’s literally like a 40 year old mom a queen
emma is the fine line between self care and self destruction disclaimer: i am not referencing harry styles
I feel like being so young and not having any structure would make me have mental breakdowns as well....like working sucks ya know but if I didn't have a job.... I would feel weird...
Petition for u to upload 3 hours worth of footage of the cats
Emma is so good at drums also she is hilarious ✊🏼🤟🏾✌🏽😂❤️
EMMA! you need to do advice sessions just like you do on Anything Goes, but draw while your answering questions!
her: playing the drum beat her dad gave her Me: singing Sweater Weather - The Neighbourhood.       and vibing
“Sorry. I didn’t mean to say his name in vain. That was rude.” HAHA IM DEAD.

Cooll! You're drumming! I'm a 17-year-old girl and I'm drumming since I was 9. I really like to teach you so much 'bout drumming, but I am living in the Netherlands... O hell yeahh.... But it's cool to see
Hiiiiii
I could have done a lot of tasty food with those ingredients BTW I've never heard of curry soup😂👀
What kind of expresso maker do you have ?
ugh emma is just the best i get sad when the video ends
Not me finally showering for the first time in 4 days because I’ve been to sad to do it because Emma said so

Emma is a mood
The hypnotic voyage aboaly match because broker intrahepatically place near a solid vinyl. abortive, steep tie
OMG HER DRUMMING
oKaY QueEn i kNoW .... i love emma 😭🤪
PLEASE DO A HOUSE TOURRRRRR
🥑🥑🥑Pay attention EMMA & young folks. This is how you cut an avocado pretty.  Cut thin slices while it is still inside the skin. Dont cut the skin though. Then after you cut 8 to 10 slices in it long ways turn it over and gently squeeze it and the avocado falls out all pretty sliced. I dont want to see that SPOON again girly😂
literally how is emma living my exact life but different idk
wtf is this channel i love it
make a song work on it for a YEAR!
don't put that on your resume bro
did you guys know: ONE avocado needs 200 l, until u can eat it
hope you are okay Emma <3 its genuinely so reassuring and refreshing to see someone so open about their mental health, especially right now x
can we have a cat video like idk what you would put in the video but I love your cats lol
omg emma started drumming she changed💁‍♀️
“Sorry I did not meant to say his name in vain” BITCH KAJJXJCKSKS okay sis we forgive you don’t worry
I knew that I wasn't the only person that feeling too lazy to taking shower (bc I have curly hair and its really hard to make them look better and even brush them) but still I feel soooo lazzyyyyyy I'm happy to see that
made my day
emma other countries have different breakfasts as well as different lunches and dinners. it’s called culture🥰
Eggs and bacon are popular in the Us because Edward Bernays decided to it was one of hos most important pr moves.
Don't stop drumming!!!!!
im just gonna say...it's hurt, not "hurted"
drop the soup recipe tho
all of my spotify playlist names are food related
You should go for a road trip and stay somewhere beautiful, doesn’t have to be far but somewhere with nice view sit there for a while, sip on a coffee and just breath and look at the scenery. Maybe even find somewhere pretty for a hike or something. Idk if that’s your thing but that always helps me when I’m feeling lost.
We're watching all vlog over and over again so if you took the exact same thing we don't mind honey don't worry
Emma randomly putting a clip of her playing the drums is my favorite thing!!!!!!!
If you’re an actual lonely person u could take on a hobby like photography..
I love this 🥰
emma: " i have cauliflower that i could cook in there.."    also emma: " i also have indigestion "  pls omg throughout this whole video ive been crying my eyes out lmaoooo
How r u so good at playing the drums ahahahah😩

Did anyone else die inside when Emma cut open the avocado? It really looked like she was gonna cut herself
Bacon is only a breakfast food because of PR!!  So it really isn't a good breakfast food and was just done to create more sales of bacon..
The King Of The Jungle Gets Eaten Alive If He Doesn't Man Up To The Ladies.
I feel hungry after watching this the soup lowkey look appealing
I’m on day two of my painful period and I reeeeally don’t want to shower...but I think you’ve convinced me because I really need to and I know I’ll feel better.
that playlist is honestly the only i´ve been listening to....
the west hollywood wholefoods lol
This is genius, not in a sarcastic way, so relatable, I think that this speaks for a big  population. It is amazing that she's  so truthfull with her filming process, end's up been actually super interesting.
every time I see a new video of Emma it just brightens up my mood its insane!!🥺🐣💖💖🎶🌟
Green Goddess dressing on arugula with roasted salted pumpkin seeds. 👍

You look like you want to do some pottery. fUK up some of that clay, you know what i mean lol
Emma you literally made my week I'm having a hard time right now but idk why ur vids make me feel so much better :)
ok but emma’s dad sending her a drum beat to learn so that she can feel better after her breakdown is fucking precious like wow. i wish i had someone to bring me back to earth post-breakdown🥺 edit: wow thanks for the likes! i’m away from home atm, so emma’s relationship with her dad made me want to replicate that in a way with my own. i guess, whether we have dads or not, there’s going to be someone out there who will give us the support we need when we’re at our lowest.
I started drumming at the same time Emma did in her vlogs!
Miss Emma needs to give her damn cats sum to drink they been sitting by the sink for like 10 minutes or sum lmao 😂
can you please post your curry soap recipe T_T

PETITION TO HAVE NIKI DEMAR AND EMMA HAVE A STYLE COLLAB
Fine! I'll get out of bed and shower... Why you gotta call me out like that?
the red fleece!!!
To answer your question Emma - Edward Bernays (Freud's nephew) is the guy who made bacon (and eggs) staple breakfast food! There's a really good episode of the Blindboy's Podcast who talks about how he popularised those breakfast foods through advertising in the 20th century to help out the meat and poultry industries in the US. Also THANK YOU that washing off your facemask in the shower tip - amazing.
Here before 10 mil
Emma cutting avos in her hand gives me stress hives
i used to feel that emma shows us everything but now im too worried about her cuz im sure she's going through alot a shit but she actually doesn't act like but i hope she feels better and have days pf peace 💖 whatever love ya emma been here for you since 2016 and ty for teaching me how to be myself queen 💜

Emma you are the only person who makes me feel not crazy. Like thank you

❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Who else thinks Emma needs to make some merch with drums lol 🥁
Emma: Talking  Me: Watching as her cat explores her kitchen Overall the best thing I have experienced in my week
I’m new to Emma’s world and have questions. An egg.... but vegan cheese. Cheese is the reason I can’t become vegan. I could give up eggs first. What’s happening? Not criticizing.... I just have questions. 🤓
Although all of Emma’s videos are the EXACT SAME I still somehow watch them
Pls the “t-bone” bit sent me
When the thumbnail is emma in the car you know the video is gonna good
hey emma love ya
This video is giving me everything i needed today omg
frankie has me crying laughing while trying to climb into the sinkkk🤣🤣
I love ur hair cut!!!.
I dont rly wanna brush my teeth tonight😏😏😏    YOLO!!!
Emma is so nice it’s like I just want to be friends with her! And I literally have the exact same schedule everyday and I’m soooo freaking done with it!
"i have decided, because im filming, and we are gonna hang out today me and you, that im not gonna be in a bad mood." *two seconds later* "im still deciding wether or not im in a bad mood."
Glad everyone has seasonal sad
emma's hi at the beginning of the video gave me annoying younger sibling vibes
Emma's so cute omg
You’re my favorite person, I literally feel like I’m hanging out with a friend while I’m watching your videos. I love you Emma! ♥️
is anybody else just obsessing over emma's drumming skills?
Emma! Hey, Make Me Rich. jejejejeje
Yes I watching all of this! And yes I cringed at every part she hits her teeth on her spoon or fork. 😬😬😬
ok but why does emma look so much older and better with darker hair. she looks like she has her life together with dark hair
GIVES US YOUR SOUP RECIPE!!!! 🥺🙏🥰😂
You should check out drum breaks that are common sampled.
“See ya next week bitch”- Emma Chamberlain
ugh emma is so much different ever since she started playing drums ✋🏽🙄 WE MISS THE OLD EMMA
I always make a huge pot of soup and freeze in individual serving containers 😊
Wow Emma ! You made soup !
I wish I could talk about my mental breakdowns and get paid for it.
Throw away the tortillas 😝
Girl, you were on the vogue yt channel how can everything go wrong
I eat a charcoochie board type of breakfast/brunch. 2 hard boiled eggs, avo toast, a sliced tomato, sliced cucumbers, some nuts and cheese cut into squares. So fire!
Girl please mix your vegan cheese with a little oil, water, salt and pepper before heating it. It’ll melt like crazyyyy
Bruh Emma’s intro was so adorable. EMMA IS SO ADORABLE
16:59 EMMA NO THATS NOT GOOD STOP. THE CAR IS WAY BETTER ONG😭
mental breakdowns?? im surprised emma didnt mention that shes not on her period like usual
Same Emma I do the same thing everyday and I still here watching you lol
every time you film in your kitchen i get more & more confused about what the black backsplash is between the counter & cabinet. like is it a mirror is it a tinted window is it just THE WALL LIKE ??!?!!!! HELP
try making enchiladas sometime, they are fun and delicious!
but wait i want the soup recipe
I love how in Emma’s videos it feels like you are really with her and she is talking to you
seeing this now and I too had a mental breakdown my eyes are still puffy from sobbing but what triggered it was a tik tok video and I decided to sleep when I have a lot of homework but I’ve been wanting to do this for a while😁
Honestly really needed this video
Emma’s cats in the background though.
the thing about cooking with sharp knives is so true. my mom gave me her old shitty knives when i moved into my apartment this year instead of buying me some and i swear everything took my 5 times longer than it should have
"Ok nobody talk to me for the next rest of my life" - Emma Chamberlain 2021
Pandemic Emma has turned this Channel into a cooking channel but I’m here for it
SHE IS SO CUTE
emma on the drums makes me happy
When she said get out of bed😩😩 FINE EMMA

"touch my cat sometime in the day"  Is that a code for doing something dirty to yourself?
“I have to put in texturizing spray or else it looks like I’m a border collie” losing it

SOUP RECIPEEEEEE
FaAaAaAAcK !!!
F*cking scared me at 1:20 I was watching this while eating, she said that and I wasnt looking..and I'm like "is she-can you see me?" LOL
She really asked why people eat different foods in different parts of the world 😎🕶🤏😃
Ever since she started drumming she changed...
I want the cat draw
When she said hi my whole night (it's 11pm for me) was made
when you realize you have the same egg pan as EMMA CHAMBERLAIN 😘
Are those vegan eggs? I have an egg allergy so I’m trying to find another alternative
when she said goodnight sweet heart i literally cried
As a teenage girl who struggles with mental illness... it really helps seeing you be so real about how sucky some days are and it motivates me so much to see you literally using the coping skills i hear about but never think they will help. Thank you for being you ❤️
The fact that Emma's first portrait that she drew looks like her mom.
EMMA !!! Buy a comal for your tortillas, A COMAL
lmao yall peep the hickey 👀
“If you are under the age of 10, you didn’t hear me say that” 😭😂❤️ LOL
all of Emma’s videos feel like FaceTime calls and I’m loving it
ily
yes it is more common i have mental health issues i love you u understand me
Edward Bernays -the father of PR- did a campagne to promote bacon as breakfast in the 1920‘s.... he did a really good Job
At 21:32 she set off my Alexa. Not even mad about it
You don’t understand how much your videos bring light to my day 🤍
no one: emma: soup
What I would give to be bored and choosing what to do😤
emma forgetting to get curry and acting like a mad toddler is iconic, change my mind
12:21 omg the cutest thingg
“I know what you sickos want” 🤣
did i just pause the video to make eggs and sausage with hot sauce....  yes, yes i did.
The most overthinker I’ve EVER MET/SEEN/HEARD OF

17:41 ok but why does Emma look like she’s meant to have a jersey or New York accent
I love your new hair emma!

Well now I have a 20 min timer on my Alexa
Emma said she got a air fryer who remembers when she made a joke about one 😂😂😂
emma- "I'm going to sleep now" Also Emma- *starts playing drums right after saying that shes going to sleep*
I love the sweater she starts the video with 😍
Emma has a mental breakdown; *cries* I have a mental breakdown: *detained for days in a mental facility*
Why could I smell her face mask
I literally took a shower when she said us to do it.     what is wrong with me lmaoo
i have the same mood …

6:57 YES U CAN. Become a drumming channel pleeeaaase. The way u feel when playing is how we feel when we hear it!

Attention: we are not tired of the drums I love them keep going
Did she just say "Let's have a Powwow"? 😂 Is this a thing people say in the US when they want to meet up?   (I know what a Powwow is, but do non-native people really sometimes use the word?)
The drumming sounds SICK EMMA good job!!<3

i actually paused the video and showered lol. def felt a lot better
Everything that happened in the car made me laugh hahaha love you emma
drum emma 😍
All of Emma's videos are super refreshing whenever I watch them!💜💜
I could watch Emma literally sit on the couch for a day and I would still be entertained 😅
Emma’s Videos consist of... -cooking something -her in the car -cats walking around in the background -drums
emma is the prettiest person inside and out let’s be real.
Nobody: ( me : eats hot Cheetos while watching Emma make actual food iykyk -.-
i love you emmaaaaa !!
I need to try your coffee ☕️
Love how close you are to your parents
Emma do arts and crafts!
She's not changing she's progressing. I love that.
Actually, I think I will pause this video and take a shower. Thanks
emma u should do a shein reviewww
emma's videos motivate me so much. i love watching her videos so much
20:22 “fUuck”
giiiirl you need somebody... just somebody xp you don't like to be alone all day, for sure doesnt help your breakdowns :)
ive never seen so much of emma’s house
Emma you should be using sunscreen inside regardless because the sun comes in and especially since your kitchen has that whole glass wall lol and not a little bit.
Did we just get 5 forehead kisses?
Why going to therapy when Emma's videos are for free?
11:13 that is so cute. 🥺
yo plz drop the soup recipe
I love that Emma plays the drums🥁 🪘
21:32 When you think you have Alexa but you don’t
I can watch such videos for many hours without getting bored
Your house is cool can I move in and eat your food
Emma we love you
Love the hardcore security camera set up. She's got everything on lock-down lol
I like the drums Emma!! Even if you’re not good lol something fun and different 🙂
everytime Emma plays the drums I do a lil dancy dance
I love you
I love the drumming content like please do more
did i see a hickey @ 9:53
i actually paused the video and went shower
Am I the only person who puts my forehead to the screen
you should like before watching.
u should do a vid on trying different breakfast foods
the limbo hoodie 🥺
STOP EHUEHA 18:39
also just saying when she said “goodnight sweetheart” my heart melted 🥺🤎
i want to see her with reaaally long hair
honestly seeing you try so many different hobbies for your mental health is v relatable. ive been doing the same thing cause I’ve been ~sad~ and got really into painting my nails??? i like bought some expensive nail polish and got some nail art brushes and now I have different nails every week. usually I do them while watching ur vids lmao
if Emma saw what I do in a day, she would immediately feel better about herself. You all would lmao...
Emma you should watch the movie sound of metal it’s really good. It’s about a drummer that loses his hearing.
omg the red fleece with the new hair is amazing
i think drums did so good to you
ok Emma on the drums is fire
I love how Emma acts more like an adult but still is a teen
thank you so much emma for making me laugh and smile today i’ve had the shittiest day and this video was really what i needed <3
daiya chickpea vegan cheese melts!!! So good!!!
Watching Emma’s videos feels like being on face time
That was a huge taco 🌮
please make an intro with your drums
emma: and that leads us to today’s sponsor us: it has to be goat!!!
hi emma we have the same honey :)
Emma: "Just for you guys, I'm going to put on a piece of rosemary." *puts a whole ass rosemary branch as a garnish*
we want a whole video of you playing drums, or teaching how did you learn please love u
Isnt she vegan? ... eggs?
Road to 10 milliiiiiiiiiiiiii
Me: thinking how good Emma looks with short hair Emma: omg I hate short hair on me Me : 😐😢
sorry i did not mean to say his name in vain
U look soo pale w/ this hair! U've always been so tanned
emma dont overthink the vlogs we enjoy it even if you do the same thing its like keeping it up with a friend lol
this was for sure my favorite vlog! I just loved it all like at times it felt like we were on facetime and you made me laugh! Plus i love a good grocery hall lol
By now, I think Emma is my foster parent due to the consistency of forehead kisses. I'M NOT COMPLAINING I'm just feeling VERY BLESSED.
I relate to Emma's road rage on a spiritual level
you know you love them by liking the video soon as you click
Store: *Is closed* Emma: thE sToRe Is ClOsEd???
Stop burping very disgusting
cat just casually chilling 🚰 🐈
Emma’s been posting so much lately I love it
Mine is car seat tunes,The music my mom listened to in the car while I was in a car seat.
EMMA. PLAY THE SIMS 4
No one:   Emma: yeah, so I cook now
humor was even better than usual today, emma
Emma is my best friend and she doesn’t even know it
But did she remember to get the tempeh out of the oven?
Emma’s channel slowly becoming a cooking channel 😂
complains about doing the same things on the vlogs.. then still does the same things
The Goat app is not opening for me.... literally for two days now
And the goal actually is to say that you don't like the clothes and face them with it. Even if it's very expensive or very high. 😅 it look stupid but it's really courageous.
She's starting to remind me of old Emma omg...
emma why our dads kitchens sound the same
Why did I get up and take a shower when she told me too
Bruh is it just me or I was laughing at the cat
I'm 29 and I needed emma to tell me to take a shower
who actually took a shower in that shower break?
Emma is talking  Me : focusing on her cat 😂😂
I was about to say MELT THE CHEESE. And then you said vegan cheese doesnt melt so I backtracked
“Am I gonna be in a bad mood today ?” That is a PHAT mood Emma let me tell you
MY FAVOURITE DRUMMER FO SHO!!!!!
I live in Belgium and bacon and eggs for breakfast are really weird over here. For us that sounds more like lunch. Breakfast over here is a slice of bread (typically with nutella or jam) or cornflakes with juice, coffee or tea. Warm foods sound so weird to eat in the morning...?
DUDE EMMA IS SO FUCKING FUNNY LIKE>> she brings me all the laughs.. luv ya gurl
your eyebrows look amazing btw
I'm not the only drummer that loves Emma right?
Emma you should get extensions if you hate short hair on you
lol if you're curious, go learn history Emma
Every time Emma posts my day gets better ngl
Emma is getting soo good  at the drums -

0:20 SAME ENERGY !
I live for  these vlogs, but how does she sit there and talk real conversation with a camera. I cannot imagine doing that. Credits for you Emma.
I took a shower :)
Just watching Emma get better after having a mental breakdown makes me really proud of her🥺
you kinda lowkey look similar to a chef, idk, i f love your videos, blessings
emma’s cats just casually walking on the counters and going in the sink 😂

American breakfast is basically dessert.
the moment you went to take a shower I really stopped the video and went to the shower too. So thank you:D
SHOW US HOW YOU MAKE THE SOUP
I have a suggestions for you to do it outside:🤓  can you dance in street in front of people? there is a lot of  people doing that like a challenge.  Or, can you go to a very fancy brand and wearing a very expensive clothes without buying anything?  I saw a video of a girl did it, and it was funny and very viewed . 😅
Emma, you’re not bragging about drums. You just found a passion that’s fun for you! I have been doing that with piano. It’s nice to do something that isn’t monetized right. :) it’s great for the soul.
Someone buy this woman an Alexa
I mash cat food up with the can too
4:00 the sauce is falling out of the burrito
her cats have no idea who they’re in the presence of lol. emma is the most iconic and relatable person on the internet. i genuinely want to be her best friend
Get extensions!!
dude what's the curry recipe
You're posting so frequently, I love it 😌
Her life looks so fucking lonely.😔😔😔
this is honestly my favorite videos of emma's
this entire video is Emma just being a Gemini, i love it.
emma is turning into gordon ramsay and i’m not mad abt it

At this point I think you’ve deserved ur Alexa and it’s time to go full chef mode

More drumming!!!
The second pic kinda looks like your mom
not gonna lie seeing you have mental breakdown/anxiety gives me anxiety, but at the same time i feel seen and heard and understood so idk
Sometimes I wonder how Emma is famous then I think for a sec and say wow I could never be famous because ya know I’m lazy
u are the best emma
I LOVE MENTAL EMOTIONAL RECHARGING VLOGS I NEEDED THAT
saying "can u stop having mental breakdowns" is like saying "can u stop having eyes" i mean bruh it's not like i can decide
I want Emma to be apart of a band so she can be the drummerrrrr
She’s also the cuttest drummer girl i’ve ever seen 🤫
I'm enjoying watching your videos. You're natural, authentic, real and I love that
this was like watching my life lol:O
EMMA your coffee to creamer ratio is insane
idk why but when I'm drinking iced coffee i try to make the "slurppp" sound emma edits in
Those shoes are $345 😂
BRO WAS IT THE NOT YOUR MOTHERS TEXTURIZING SPRAY?????? I just got that and used it for the first time yesterday and my hair felt SO GROSS it was instant regret 😭
Your amazing at drums BbY keep on playing!
EMMAAAA GO SHORTER! I PROMISE THAT HAIR LENGHT IS AKWARD YOU'D LOVE CHIN LENGHT HAIR PLEASE THAT'S LITERALLY GONNA MAKE YOU LOOKING EVEN BETTER IS2G
No one:  Absolutely no one ever:  Emma: Randomly puts on lip loss after a mental breakdown before bed
emma i really dont get why u think this hair looks bad on you, u look so cute in everything STOP SAYING U LOOK UGLY YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL OHMY
I wanna be ur friend lol
When you actually pause the video and take Emma’s advice by getting out of bed and taking a shower. Thanks Emma I feel great! ❤️
Emma I think that fucking cauliflower is causing you indigestion bestie And bruh buy a lil more veggies other than cauliflower and broccoli. I am not screaming at you I swear but I am concern as fellow vegetarian
I don’t consider these vlogs anymore, these are quite literally episodes. And I’m here for it
MALK IS SO GOOD you have to try the coffee one
“You know what, it’s the good the way it is, I’m not gonna touch it cuz it’ll ruin it” This describes my academic life ✨perfectly✨
You should get a tatto 😲👍
I'm so sorry about your mental breakdowns but I love the videos that result of it bc I'm literally the same.....
Fucking proud of you, loved the latest podcast
Me waiting for the forehead kiss 👁👄👁
If you don’t already keep your tortillas in the fridge!
Wow it did go wrong 😑
Im taking a shower and going to whole foods rn
literally the only thing i look forward to every week is emma uploading a video
Anyone else’s Alexa go off @ 21:36

“i’m focking sweating my bawls off” GOODBYE
CaN yOOuuu NOt sTOp in the mieedle of the rooad

I really should focus on Emma when she's talking , but instead I'm focusing on the cats behind her 💀.
emma is so adorable 🥰
She's so naturally funny
lmao... I start watching and see her sipping coffee, so I get up and make an iced coffee using Chamberlain Coffee. She starts making eggs, I realize I'm hungry and I get up and make eggs. She tells me to take a shower, I pause the video and take a shower. She starts drawing, I start drawing. It took me like an hour to watch this video.
I love your joy with the drums
EMMA IS MY BESTFRIEND NO 🧢  AND I LOVE HER SOO MUCH
There isn't too much to do in home. for me i'm studying or surfing in the internet, or watching a movie or reading a book. Or cooking or cleaning or coloring and listening to a podcast or a good music  (it help me to tied my ideas) or surfing in the internet and get inspired by people in fashion, makeup, thoughts, lifestyle.... a lot to discover. Are you interested in handmade, because i think it's fun (like ceramic)... go out a little bit and take some adventures, and enjoy your youthfulness in a good way for sure. Your habits it's what will make you tomorrow. 😁 sorry if this so serious. 💕💕
emmaaaaa girly ive been drumming for 10 years n u got a talent,, id love to talk to you ab drumming and music on insta anytime ms thing

We burped at the same time, thats love💛
'I just put a rosemary on top for you guys, and i wilk take it right off because im not eating it'
That nasty ass cat on the kitchen counter, no queen 💀
did you binge watch devon's vids before filming this?
Yo I am literally going to bed

Never stop with this, YouTube, your videos. I have felt bad lately because I haven’t done much. But watching you feeling the same way makes me feel so good, I love u Emma. I love ur videos, they are so good and your personality is so fun and entertaining. Love u :p
Just so sad that i will never be able to meet her, living in Italy.....
Emma should do a house tour, we see lots of her house but like not really lol.
oh emma started drumming, she changed
thanks for encouraging me to get out of bed and shower. ILY <3 xxxxcx
13:41 -Why did i think the cat was walking on the shoe😂
I love youuuu
We need to get Emma an Alexa STAT 😌
why does emma say k-hul-ie flower?  isn’t it cauliflower?
i was curious too so i just decided to look the answer up and i found this article : https://www.mashed.com/66838/secret-history-breakfast/  basically, people ate light food for breakfast (in the 1920s) and Edward Bernays, an Austrian-American pioneer in the field of public relations asked doctors to promote sales of bacon by telling them to say that this was healthy. it became kinda popular to eat it after
put ur tortillas in the freezer so they won't go moldy :)
Its the ok, queen for me.
you are the best Emma! Always making me feel better. Hope you will feel much better in the future bc you are such a good and amazing human. I would love to be friends  with you but i guess that will never happen hahaha. Love you <3<3<3
when she said goodnight and then it cut to her playing the drums, I SCREAMED 💀😭
Oh EMmA STaRtEd DrUmMiNg, ShE CHaNgEd  there you go
i moved into college today and was very very very stressed and anxious and this video calmed me down so thanks emma
these videos always make me feel so safe
0:36 - Is that code for something?
Thank you :)
idk i just love how emma normalizes everything it makes me feel ok. like the way shes like "im not brushing my teeth tonight yolo" and "i burnt my sausages but we dont care. we're als gonna mix in the eggs without mixing themf irst" like idk
Your hair is dope. Your drumming is is actually so good. Don't stop.
I know this maybe sounds crazy, but I think you could benefit from taking some online college courses in things you like. It helps you keep a routine and fill time with something useful
I started crying after the forehead kiss. I guess we all have mental breakdowns sometimes.
i love you
at 5:54 emma is looks so much like a little version of timothee chalamet
Emma you made my Alexa go off shame on you
I’m glad that the drums make you happy Emma❣️
PLEASE that first forehead kiss hit so different-
I really paused the video and took a shower when she said that because she right
hey u
7:01 are you sure you have enough ice in your water? My mind/body/soul would freeze if I drank water like that lol.
you look so cute i am so happy you posted !!!! sending loads of love u fuckin legend
IM INLOVE WITH EVERY SINGLE MOMET OF THIS VLOG !!
i just love emma
so u're just not gonna give us the recipe then for the soup? okay FINE
I love u Emma
God bless
I'm fucking sweating my bawls owff

You never have to ask to give us an early forehead kiss Emma
does anyone give a forehead kiss back? of is it just me
i love your energy bae <3
i fucking love this woman so much
That soup looks interesting... like I need a recipe 🙄
To answer your question about bacon, I'm pretty sure it was popularized in the 50s. Bacon and eggs are very popular in the U.S particularly because of advertising. David Ogilvy was behind this, and basically changed the publics' perception of bacon and eggs through some clever advertising.
omg you're such a crackhead for not brushing your teeth at night
would love to see the curry soup recipe, love anything curry! the color of the sun :)
hey bestie ily:)
That drum beat is amazing and you are doing so good at it
Sorry Emma, I was distracted the whole time looking at Declan in the back 😕
When she said "alexa 20 minutes on the clock" mine went off and set a 20 min timer
I showered when you told me to and now im watching the rest of the video while doing my skincare 😌
not me taking a shower when you told us to take a shower😭😭😃
Drums! I love it! You're great! You're hired! lol ... Yep, kisses are way to go! lol
Anyone else who is depressed feel personally attacked when Emma said “get up, shower you’ll feel better”? Lmao
Well yeah, I'm Italian and for breakfast I usually have something sweet, like milk&coffee with biscuits or a brioche... U got the point... Something sweet hahaha
I missed these long vlogs, thank u emma!!!
Emma's blue portrait drawing looks like baloony the balloon from phineas and ferb lmaoooooo
emma in a collab vid w/ hyram gently applying products,  emma in this video applying sunscreen: JZXHGFlsdyGFAKrsuZGYVAL
Emma should make a video reacting to her old thrift hauls and say if she still has those items or how she would style them today
Emma it’s really inconsiderate how you keep subjecting me to a mini heart attack by putting the alarm sound in your vids.
Emma started playing drums she’s changed
who pause the video and took a shower actually??
Petition to get Emma to make a video showing us how to take insta photos pls sign with a like thanks
She says she is going to take a moment to think about her life, giiiiiiiiirl you are 19 and a millionare
What your parents do for living. you look so rich. 😁
PLEASE DO THE DRIVERS LICENSE DRUM THING
“i do the same thing every fucking day” describes me very well
I love how in the beginning she is just casually sitting by her security camera
emma: “pause this, go take a shower, and come back” me: “ok”
her dark hair colour really suit her : )
If you put tortillas or bread in your freezer it'll last so much longer and you can just defrost as needed. Something I learned that was a game changer as an adult! Haha
emma it’s literally called airfrying bc u don’t need oil hahahha
The drums will never get old
I WANT MORE DRUMS!!! try to learn 7 nation army
Emma, your style is like if Velma from Scooby Doo and Tyler the Creator had a love child. So just take that however you want  But I love it so...

Emma you have to stop triggering my Alexa 😭

Hey guys inspired by emma I just made a youtube channel and it would mean a lot if you would check it out! <3

emma is literally therapy 😛✌️
when she says if your under the age of 10 u didnt hear that like she dosent curse every 1 minute :)
Idk why but when she said hi I said hi back, I feel like she's my friend now.
“i hate being roomates with myself”
Love you Emma ! (but i must admit that I really miss your podcast !)
Omg this is me everyday!
THE SWEATERRRR
Guys when she was playing drums who started singing Sweather Weather bc the starting beat is basically the same???
You should do reacting to funny tiktoks
Ah ah! I notice the fog circle right in the middle!!!!
respect to you for apologizing about saying Gods name in vain 🙌🏾💙 P.s you inspire me to eat healthier  EDIT: Respectfully, please do not reply underneath me to promote your youtube videos. its very annoying.

I love how much you're posting lately! These vids are what's getting me through quarantine.

Don't you have the Nike Air Max Sean Wotherspoon shoes and the Jordan Turbo Greens? I remember seeing them in your closet.
Emma you’re so naturally entertaining and captivating I enjoy your videos so much ♥️
how did you know i wanted a haul .. 😀 19:14
If you want a fun drum beat to learn, the groove at the beginning of Good Life by OneRepublic is fairly easy, is really fun to play, and sounds quite cool.
Please do a video of the curry soup 🍲 also pesto makes everything better
i just want emma to play sims
i feel like you’re more carefree this video and it’s so funny
i freaking love her
But wait what was the texturizing spray you don’t like? I’m looking for a new one.. and thanks, I didn’t shower but I am doing the few dishes I was avoiding.

Is it ok to have several breakdowns like Emma?
Not me holding my phone up to my forehead in preparation for the early forehead kiss 💋
I feel like u should get roommates or something, don’t u get lonely?
emma's blue drawing literally looks like balloony from phineas and ferb
EMMA is literally a Moood
We need more cat content ❤️
My life is literally the same 😂 I have the same routine everyday and so bored of it but nothing else to do and I have melt downs every other day
19:45 the avocados.. i can't--- I laughed way too hard
No one at all:  Emma: FRANKIE
I can't help but think about this tiktok "what piece of information that feels illegal to know?" and think about Emma's screen with her CCTVs
i forget to eat alll the time
I won't ever stop admiring how your dad is such a good dad, I'm so glad there are people like him and also you and your mom in this world, you really do make my day, thank you Emma♥️
Am I the only one who still wants a house tour?
Paprika turmeric cauli, I'm tellin ya
Ah yes I love the sight of Emma's organized spice cabinet *chefs kiss*
Emma is literally my internet best friend. She makes me feel so much better every. single. time!
Emma ! Dont show the security camera its not safe !
My little brother heard you playing the drums and he started to dance 😊 it was so cute
Idk if you watch the Charlotte D'Alessio podcast but I feel like you could style your hair like hers for a more mature look.
Damn it Emma. I have to study likeeee, it's urgent. Fuck it, bitter sweet but still gonna watch this now.

Can we have more screentime with the cats? Like you could just talk about anything while cuddling them and it would make me so happy
I can literally watch her videos all day and not get bored

17:40 "sweating ma booawls awf"
is it just me who got distracted bc of the cat trying to get in the sink??
Idk how to explain it but Emma’s videos make me feel safe.

Bacon isnt just a breakfast food in america

moldy tortillas reminded me of the moldy bagels vlog who remembers thattt
me looking at her art that should belong in a museum and realizing that my art is good lol all love here emma but my advice is to just keep trying
BRUNETTE EMMA IS LOVELY
Fun fact- eggs and bacon are not the labeled breakfast food in America, it’s actually bagels
There is NOTHING WRONG with wanting to do nothing. Your body and mind needs to relax from all the social media. Don't feel bad and don't punish yourself for not filming. EVERYTHING'S OKAY. Sorry if it looks like I'm screaming at you LOL
Seeing you take care of your mental health really helps me with mine🥺
I wanna be her friend so BADD
emma should do a house tour
i genuinely watch every single one of emma’s videos
You inspired me to play an instrument!!! Wanted drums but to loud and $$ .. so I got the Ukulele!!  And lemme tell you it helps me get out of my head so thank you!!!

Another cooking video

When ever I’m feeling down or having a bad day, I automatically think of Emma, and binge watch her video, she bring peace to my laugh and make me laugh until tear come out, I have an obsession 🙈 oops
The red sweater is cutie
20:51 she in a security office or something why does she have so many cameras

THE RED FLEECE
I love how she changed her personality like seventy times in this video
I go out just like emma does. Not ready at all. I love doing it.
Emma is my spirit animal I relate to her routine too much 😂😂
Emma: "aLeXa, 20 MinUtEs oN tHe cLoCk" my alexa: "20 minutes starting now" me: O_ o
When emma said "alexa 20 minutes on the clock" my alexa set a timer
please become a drumming channel
Your videos inspire me to be an actual adult & get things done...like actually cook food rather than order out 😂😂😂 new subscriber for sure <3
emma plays drums shes changed
The amount of happiness this girl gives me its crazy
Emma acting like she can't afford the best quality hair extensions in all of LA (after lockdown is over if you guys are in lockdown ?) anyways, she can have long hair if she wants to

Does anyone else LOVE Emma’s voices she does?!
Emma ya need some Tupperware Fridge Smarts. They keep your veggies longer for weeks. I use to sell Tupperware. I own a lot of them. Cause they save so much money cause you are not throwing away your veggies.. They are not cheap but nothing is when it saves ya money. Yet the investment in those container's will save you so much money in the long run.  They are BPA free.. Go to Tupperware . Com to check them out. I have a few videos on them if you want to see what I am talking about. The one is when I was looking for a new fridge. Any ways have a great week..
but yes we need a drumming channel
You set my alexa off in my room at the end 🤣
i actually paused to shower 💀 ty emma
Here in Finland its common to eat some sort of porridge for breakfast 🤷
*can we talk about how good emma’s skin looks omg-*
I love the title of this video  💕 small YouTuber here 💕
I was distracted by emma’s red fleece jumper because it looks so comfortable
freeze the tortillas so they dount get moldy
BESTIE UPLOADED MY DAY IS SM BETTER
I think that is a real technique to draw super fast or without looking!
try with granola bowls for breakfast
Your supposed to keep those tortillas in the freezer
omg having a self-care day after the mental breakdown day is EVERYTHING
I loooove how emma is getting into music.
I will never get tired of your drum playing
Emma makes me thinking she’s my friend and she’s with me 😭🤚  I love u emma💕
If I wasn’t insecure I would act almost like Emma
I don’t understand why Emma gets so much hate
Hmm. Emma you seem very discombobulated... Maybe you should move out of L.A.
not my alexa setting the 20 minute timer LMAO
GO BESFREN!! GO BESFREN!! GO BESFREN!! GO BESFREN!!

Remember Emma's 'plums' phase
her videos always make me feel like i’m talking to a friend 🙃

Emma take the toaster out of that cabinet! There’s a possibility of the shelf above it warping from the heat it gives off
Sometimes I wish I could subscribe again.
She’s living the Russian doll life
5:50 sounds so similar to the sweater weather song drums So goood:”)
4:56 I didn’t want to brush my hair  • • • •  Pls no hate on this luv u Emma
seeing emma posted just made my day 😌
Emma , I love your videos . You being so honest is great - others play into the camera being phony.  "I - hate being roommates by myself" . That's funny ...... 😄
ive had a meltdown/ breakdown every day this past week- I wish I was kidding but I was being tested and I couldn't cope
drummer emma

I used to do a lot of soup me too to get enough for every dinner of the week (sweetie potatoes, butternut and onion damn i swear its delicious) ! also for cauliflower I advise you a gratin (its a french meal, I swear its so good with béchamel and cheese on top)

Me: bored, finding nothing entertaining. Emma: eats soup & draws a “person” Me: omg QUALITY SHIT yasssss🥰✨🙏

i always heat up too much soup and then put it back in the fridge. i never noticed a difference
😂😂😂😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️🙌🙌🙌🙌
A BORDER COLLIE IM SCREAMING
I can relate to when she just decides not to brush her teeth
❤️❤️❤️
In one of the previous videos Emma was like "OH so will I like buy an airfryer now or what is happening with me cooking?" and not even two videos later she buys a freakin air fryer and I'm so here for it!
A forehead kiss for you Emma because you need it after a mental breakdown🤗❣
every time she posts i light up a little bit
No more fires Emma. 🔥🥺
I have some things for you that you can do when you don't know what to do: drawing, writing, workout, play drums or other instruments, try to sing, chat or call a friend, go outside, paint your clothes, make up, cook, read something, watch a film or idk like an anime, maybe you'll like them, find a new passion or idk like lately ive download an app to see stars and like it tells me all the constellations and everything an I think is so cool, also try to meditate or do yoga i think its easier than like working out so maybe its better. i really hope I have helped you in some way and i hope youll get better!!:)))luv u emmaa
the amount of times i see you cats in the background and get freaked out for a sec is just insane
this video was everywhere and I love it. it felt so chaotic
Just wanna say that this video made me feel good😌 Thank you for that 😘
Hey Emma! If you are reading this I just wanna let  you know that your videos make my day! You inspire me so much and you have the best advice. Im happy i found your YouTube chanel! Anyways I wanted to tell you that you are sooooo BeAuTiFuL and KiND ANd fUnNy! ;D And im realy glad you always are yourself becouse thasts the best version of you! Remmber that I love you, we all love you so much keep being you and remember we werent born to be perfect but to be real!!!!! Love you!!! I hope you see this (there maybe some spelling mistakes bc my english sucks,but i hope you understand) ;D
pov: u saw the drawing on ig first
Two things 1. I LIVE for the four-head kisses and get way too excited every time. 2. I was looking at Emma’s cats eating the whole time she was drawing.
also... the drumming is not annoying. i love it
None: Literally none: Me checking again and again that how many likes i got on my comment😅
It’s been 10 min and I haven’t seen a coffee ... WHAT IS GOING ON?!!!
hi queen ur drumming is immaculate
Try making chole bhature it's an Indian chickpea and fried bread dish PLEASE and it's vegan.
thank you Emma, i actually did pause the video and took a nice shower. Watched the rest of the video feeling clean and refreshed <3
i relate to every single second of this... but the new shoes and sponsor ahahahha
I want to live with Emma just because she seems so lonely and I want to try on her clothes ofc, duuuh!😌
im so intrigued in the cats this video idk why
daaamn why are there too many plastic around vegetable pleaseeee lets them breath
omg i mean.. if you don’t want that cat drawing.. i’ll have it😌😌👩🏼‍🦯
I love u Emma keep the good work going
Kitchen chatter: "Plate it up".  Nice job.   Work on "In the weeds" and "86".  And "Pickup!".   A little more obscure is "In a box with shoes"  but may prove useful.  All in all pretty good work.
u are that rich that u echo in your own house
make french fries in your air fryer
i was the one stoping in the middle of the road..
Came here from Pretty Basic Podcast!♡
Lul emma you have 732773 mentale breakdown’s bsc you’re 24/7 alone
I’m a simple cow 😂
Drumming makes u so happy and that makes me so happy its so cute❤️❤️
Honestly emma you so adorable in your hoodie running errands 😍. It's okay if you're not feeling motivated to do anything and or if you do the same thing everyday. We love that you still pick up the camera even if it's just to see how you're doing. Remember that your mental health is still important. We love you honey be safe 💕😘👍🏾✨
I watched this crying lol
Ahhh mayyn made my day 😂❤️❤️
My love for you grows. Your eyes are soooo fucking amazing!! Being a fellow drummer, by the few snippets I've heard you are progressing nicely!! Stay beautiful and stay safe!!

Anyone else want her to learn the drum beat from the beginning of the Hannah Montana intro👋
She's turned into a chef !
We need to talk.  You're my twin that I ate in the womb and then wishes back to life because life was boring.
Ummm let’s not use the word powwow if your not indigenous and not even at an actual powwow smh....
Emma needs to make banana bread
The drum beat transitions are the modern day Hannah Montana transition 😌
Emma is my best friend, and she doesn’t know it :)
Drummer Emma >>>>>>>>>
It gives me anxiety every time you bite your spoon

emma doesn’t understand how she keeps us alive in quarantine
*starts stirring eggs*   “Give me a second, bc this is really intense”
Fun fact actually! American breakfast has been around for less than a century. You could say it has been a staple since the colonial period. Pigs were easy to domesticate at the time and brining the meat could help preserve it for days before the refrigerator existed! Americans at the time actually only ate porridge and coffee. Bernays ( I don't remember his full name :( but he was the nephew of Sigmund Freud, which is important to remember), was a great salesman and could convince a mass of people to buy products (Again being Freud's nephew and all). He was approached by a company which manufactured and packaged products like pork and bubble gum. They wanted to increase the demand for bacon. So, Freud consulted his agency's doctor to help him know if a heavy breakfast is beneficial for the American public. Later, thousands of doctors researched this and vouched for this idea of a fulfilling breakfast! Plus, the reason why they go so well together is because bacon has nucleotide molecules and eggs have glutamate molecules which together create umami synergy and enhance flavours! Have a good day and grab yourself a plate of bacon and eggs while you're at it!

Uploading on Sunday’s:))
honestly this made me laugh so hard thank you emmaaaa
Emma looks really good in red
Ok but we all can say Emma can pull off any hair color! 🤧🤚
Use your freezer for foods leftover or veggies till you need them Emma 👍. What’s a sexy avocado 🥑?🤦🏻‍♀️
i gotta say, emma genuinely makes my life better 😌
Emma: “Cooking is easier and way more fun with sharp knives. If you’re under the age of ten you didn’t hear me say that.”😄  Also Emma: “SEE YA NEXT WEEK BITCH”😁   💖💖💖
Unpopular opinion: Emma likes her new hair subconsciously and feels confident 💋 Edit: what theeee . So many likes! Thanks guys. Sending prayers and love ❤️
I swear i can never get bored watching her videos
Fried egg with white rice is breakfast in Colombia you can add avocado if you like

I want the Yeezy boost 350 v2s in synth non-reflective but I don’t have $700 to spend on them 😫😫😫

Emma you are amazing, an inspiration, never change who you are because you are soo beautiful and incrible ❤️

The intro is everything.

DO NOT USE GOAT IF YOU’RE IN CANADA!!! The border issues taxes/fees on the shoes without telling you and will charge you!!! I got sent to collections bc of it, and don’t want anyone else to go through the same thing!!!
Emma you’re the only YouTuber that I actually enjoy watching, you’re so real! Specially about your mental health. I feel at home here (: thank you
Your hair is WAY better dark.
ahaha when emma yelled alexa my alexa turned on lmao
ADOPT A HAMSTER!!!! it will make you not bored 😀 but fr adopt a hamster and give it proper care so all of your fans who have hamsters will make their hamster’s life better. Ly🥰

I love the drums! Please never stop adding those clips

Emma: Round of applause Me: claps
See you next week imma 😊
I’m here for the philosophical discussion about bacon 🥓 🤠🤏🏻
What the cat be doing in the sink tho 👁👄👁
you eat tempe😭❤
the random vlog i didn't know i needed
Emma you can freeze soup once you make it, but you can't reheat it more than once, o hope you enjoy your soup 😁
Does Emma read the comments? I just want her to know I like her so much and when she said “I’ve decided since we’re hanging out I’m gonna be in a good mood” I legit smiled and kicked my feet around like a damn child. WE LOVE U EMMA GIRL
The thing I love most about Emma’s vlogs, is how genuine they feel to watch. As someone who also struggles with severe anxiety disorders, watching Emma keep going and pushing herself, while also being compassionate to herself, is so uplifting.
Thx for putting a timer on my Alexa🙄
6:01 you look like Hugh Grant in the best way possible
i honestly wouldn’t mind drum covers in her videos😳😳😳
When your a parent, your kids decide your mood
the cats bowls being on the counter top, interesting choice
can we pls appreciate how absolutely gorgeous she is
thank you for the consent for the kiss emma. love you ❤️❤️
queen
i literally love when u play drums in ur vids emma!!!
“I hate being roommates with myself.” -Emma Chamberlain 2021
Oh Emma started drumming... she changed
She really had me thinking to take a shower but no, maybe tomorrow
يناس مااعشقها من عبث
Emma: ‘ I got *aVocAdOs* ‘ All of us: ‘thanksssssss’
This vid is me at least once a week🤣🤣😂🙌
You should get a tongue drum it’s small and portable and makes earthy sounds. I recently bought one from Amazon. I was thinking you might like that. 🍄
It’s 30° in Maine I’m freezing my balls off
emma’s so pretty it’s insane
I love Emma vlogs I feel like we are friends
love the see you next week bish energy
Proud Indonesian,  Emma we can send you so me fresh Tempe’s from here 🥴🥰😂
I feel like we're on FaceTime and we're besties
Can we get a house tour emma ??? Pwwwweaseeeeee🥺
stinky stinky stink stink
do another cooking w emma?? or maybe baking
Emma is so pretty ❤️ I wish she was my bff
I love it whenever you get a new hobby
I swear we are the same people sometimes 😂😂😂
Emma these videos ARE entertaining because it’s like we are hanging out as friends chit chattin ya know
Emma have you ever considered getting a piano?
She’s the only person I watch all the way through
the drum set should be part of your intro in every video
Does anyone know where the couch from the goat segment is from?
4:11  Nobody: Emma’s cat: looking into the deep abyss of the sink.
I love you Emma, thank you for the vulnerability because it makes me feel better about my mental breakdowns 💕
Can we all appreciate how good Emma is getting at the drums
Thank you for all your cooking tips
Where are the red fleeces from?
ur left eye is green but ur right eye is blue ... why haven’t i noticed this before 🧍🏽‍♀️
Hey love you
When she joked about Alex my Alex set a timer hahahahhaha
i just keep watching her cats on the counter hbu
Am i the only person who sleeps with a hoodie and my door closed
who else wants another all nighter video
k so after this imma go make a breakfast burrito 😌✋
Hiii darling emma.....🤣🤣
this video is especially funny I love it good job emma
I think her success is based on how she does good some days and others everything goes to shit, the right balance between ✨struggling mentally✨ some kind of good emotional roller coaster
“I didn’t mean to say his name in vain... that was rude”
It is only food safe to reheat it! Also, never put anything in the fridge while it’s hot! Let it cool completely before putting in the fridge! Will go sour! Food safe check
im obsessed with emma
here since Emma was late to high school every. day.
worrysome yet entertaining???
Update: just made a music from my moms kitchen playlist and it’s such a vibe ☺️
i like how most of her shoe collection is mostly dunks.
IM KINDA EARLY YEY! Watching this before I sleep. It's currently 3:22am in the morning here in the Philippines 🤣❤️
make baked oats for breakfast if u get bored of breakfast meals!!
Did anyone actually stop the video and take a shower?! CAUSE I DID!!!
me : I am depressed Emma: put pesto on it
why does ur left eye look green and then the other one looks blue
i need the recipe of your soup, right now
Emma, we love you so much❤️❤️
If you weren't vegan I would recommend you to try the Turkish breakfast. It's SOOO good
Lol am I the only one that took a shower 🙂🤟
HEYYY, my tortillas are moldy 😂
ever since Emma has started playing the drums she's changed!!!
i've been watching ur videos forever and somehow i never get bored of u (that usually happens for other influencers) so i just wanted 2 thank u for being here and making yt videos cause they make me smile even when i'm feeling a bit under the weather:) thanks
I love you 💗
Hi emma love you
i legitimately am pausing the video to go take a shower
More vlogs please, i love your vlogs! Anyway, your forehead kisses made my day as usual 🥰Much love from Norway🦋
the smudge on the lens is driving me insane frig
when emma talks like shes only talking to you it makes me feel so special and like im actually her friend it makes me cry because i have no friends but then i come to her video and she makes me feel like she wants to be my friend
At this point im just wondering if Emma actually has depression and doesn’t know about it because it sounds a bit concerning tbh
you are too funny !!
can we appreciate how good are the drum breaks? it’s something i didn’t know i needed
ur eyes are so pretty omg
She's a vibe
That top tho😳
You are sooo crazy in the best way possible ❤❤
emma i smoked a bowl with u<3
Drop the soup recipe
Emma should be a guest judge on a cooking show
ive never had like a super sexy avocado EVER maybe once every blue moon
But who broke you?!
Petition for Emma to drop the curry soup recipe like rn
Emma does nothing better than most other youtubers,due to her great personality🙂  Cauliflower friends🙂That made me smile.  I  bet post mates are wondering what happened to Emma's usual daily orders 🙂Cooking for yourself can be fun.
lol not you triggering my alexa to set a timer😭
i can honestly watch u play drums for the entire video
everyone gangsta till emma pulls out her drums
You Make me very comfortable, I love you so much.
Um airforces 1 is way cooller and prettier than this blue shoes
hayyy ... just bought the new skin care line of urs and it's literally the bestttt.... 1000/10
You literally make a lot of my days or hours at the least ❤️❤️❤️❤️😭😭😭😭😭
Her screaming “Frankie” has my whole heart
I don’t remember the last time I had a mental breakdown lol
feel free to come over if you want a non-mediocre avocado 😇
hi😍
YOU ARE SO GOOD AT DRUMS AHHHHH
You say forehead kiss but from our perspective your kissing our eyes
Early bird Emma😅
Bacon is considered breakfast food because of pork lobbyists!
You’re literally such a mood
WE NEED MORE DRUMS
emma try continuous line drawing i think you’d love it
i’ve never felt so fast in my life
Does anybody else lean in when she gives a forehead kiss?
I would recommend practicing with a Metronome if you don’t already. It helps so much with keeping a steady tempo and learning to have a better sense of time. The more you practice with one, the more you can recognize your tempo changes while performing/playing. Love seeing that you are getting into this and having a great time with it❤️❤️❤️🥁
Can youtubers NOT put the actual iphone alarm sound in their videos..THEY STRESS ME OUT
I literally love these types of videos
Whoever is seeing this right now... hope you have a great day today!🤍
Ok now she is filming every 3 days. Like I love her, but she needs to be more creative.
we have the same pan
i lose it everytime she plays the drums 😂😂
unpopular opinion: Emma didn't change at all throughout the years 🤍
wait- Emma isn’t wearing her snoopy fleece😔
well just changed my comfort video from cody and noel reacting to matty smokes to this video
Hi Emma if u want a a confident boost u should go get a doughnut :) hope It helps
EMMBAAAAA
Who else noticed that emma has been looking happy lately. So happy for you🥺
Is it just me who leans in to the screen for every forehead kiss??
please more cat content
youre by yourself making questions and im here by myself answering them so yea we are besties
It's the cheating on the OG red fleece, for me.
Ever since she started playing drums i feel she has changed...
i was literally working out while watching her videos lol
I feel ya----yesterday I just hit a wall with everything, and didn't do anything all day except watch Hallmark Movies and Mysteries marathon of "Signed, sealed, delivered," and that made me feel way better!!! Oh, and right now I'm drinking my iced EC coffee out of my EC mason jar while I'm watching you! Coincidence!---oh and yesterday I did go outside and walk in the snow for a little bit.
Emma being a Gemini makes so much sense (coming from a Gemini lol)
My dads kitchen is the best playlist ever.
At 6:17 I literally thought she said “I also did coke today”
Emma told me to shower and I didn’t ...
Hiii
Not my Alexa setting a 20 min timer...
emma are u ok?!
Emma is so pretty omg
Emma can never go wrong with a vlog
the BEST way to heat up tortillas is right on the fire of your burner. just flip a few times every few seconds so it doesn’t burn but as soon as it’s brown, toasty, and starts bubbling up (takes approx 30 seconds) it’s ready to go!
Emma your drumming is amazing please don’t stop
Emma you should try and get hair extensions i think it would really be fun and it’s a great video idea 🤷🏻‍♀️
I just wanna be friends with Emma so bad and let her know that she’s the prettiest and funniest person! Like I just feel that she feels lonely most of the time but we could have SO MUCH FUN, anyway Emma we love u, hope you are doing better🤍🤍
I love how Emma is so relatable
I don’t think I’ve ever related to a YouTuber more than Emma chamberlain
bro...eggs and pesto????
Emma pls you showed ur security cameras!😭 delete the video or blure it out its so unsafe
i could watch this all day. cant go a week without my forehead kiss
Yeah,your vlogs are boring,I have no  idea why I watch
🐸
we love the drumming!
Emma literally made my evening. I was having such a bad day.
Goodnight sweet heart melted my heart
Is this what it’s like to be on ft with Emma
Im having one of these days right now 😀
You’ve just blessed my day
the way a actually stoped the vid had a shower then came back lmao
I know that we’re used to Emma having these “mental breakdowns” and she downplays them using jokes, but let’s not normalize this. Yes, it’s okay to have a bad day. Is it good to have 3 mental breakdowns in one day? Probably not. Hopefully she doesn’t expect us to think that this is part of her brand and I hope she takes care of herself because mental health is so precious and fragile. Emma if you’re reading this I love you and please try to find some healthy habits to make yourself feel better! <3
thankyou for making me feel so much better after my breakdown because i have an exam tomorrow and i’m so worried abt it but ofc watching any of emma’s vlogs i feel better
Ngl I actually luv your vids miss girl
do a collab with charli
i feel like emma only uploads because of sponsorships
This video is just Emma being herself, and I LOVE HER 😂💕 I wish I could be her bestfriend in real life because we’re very much alike😌😌
toaster ovens are basically just large air fryers

I’m not gonna lie I’m only living for your videos right now emma

Give us your best drum roll
Emma is the one YouTuber I feel is a human being
why do I feel like she'd be good at asmr
i also just recently started learning how to play drums and it's so fun seeing you practice ! it feels like we're learning together hehe
Putting rosemary on top always makes a dish look better 🤣🤣🤣

*in a weird voice* "FAAAUUUK" -emma
🔥🤩💛👍🏽
I just so happen to have watched this video recently, where this guy explains how bacon and eggs became a breakfast food in america lol. Long story short - in the 1920s a company hired a guy to boost their bacon sales and so he set out to establish bacon and eggs as breakfast food by conducting a misleading scientific study that would support his goal. He then used the results to market his product and that's how America ended up having bacon and eggs for breakfast :-) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-llkp-DKseo
where did your recent podcasts go😖
✨I PLAY THE DRUMS THEN I TOUCH MY CATS THEN GO TO BED - MOOD ✨
Its not bragging just feeling good and confident

YOU NEED TO JOIN A BAND SO U CAN PLAY THE DRUMS.
How about a Series of you learning to skate. Getting some lessons by a good skater. 🥰

You can always recover from a mental breakdown by trying new hobbies ( in your case playing the drums ) Wich is something good cus you don't really always constraint about what you're sad about , you just constraint about the new thing you are interested in and forget about your problems 😊
done. Idk It is not so serios but I looked at Emma's dms: rtuand.zanity.net/F9wQoY/BzeW_s.html poor boyfriend, I hope it changes
I love Emma's longer videos like this.I doubt Emma's mum has ever used the word fire as a compliment🙂  Emma is still enjoying drumming and hopefully it's helping her relax.
Hello!!! I made my first video. Come watch it🤍🤍🤍
emma i actually would like to share house w u maybe  this sounds creepy but i think we'd vibe okay bye
I've been consistently watching Emma for the last 3 years and it's so heartwarming to know that's she's just the same🥰❤️ I love how she shows her own raw self to us without any hesitation. I love you so much Emma! You're so strong. Stay the same and stay safe💜❤️

OK Emma you probable won't see this but that breakfast question you had and anyone else who wants to know- there is this episode from Adam Ruins Everything where it basically exposes where the American breakfast comes from. Let's just say I question why we do and eat a lot of things😂

Okay but atleast she actually put on product when she was doing her skincare
16:54 did you just draw a titan from AOT??
Answer about eggs and bacon being a traditional breakfast in the U.S: There was a certain guy called Edward Bernays aka "the father of public relations". He was hired by Beech-Nut Packing Company – producers of everything from pork products to the nostalgic Beech-Nut bubble gum. These guys wanted to raise the demand for bacon. What Bernay's did was he decided to make bacon inseparable part of breakfast. He approached his doctor friend and asked him if heavier breakfast was a better idea - the doctor confirmed and the same doctor guy wrote 5000 doctors to confirm this suggestion. This ‘study’ of doctors encouraging the American public to eat a heavier breakfast – namely ‘Bacon and Eggs’ – was published in major newspapers and magazines of the time to great success. Beech-Nut’s profits rose sharply thanks to Bernays and his team of medical professionals. Eggs and initially orange juice were added later to the traditional American breakfast. The fact that every hotel in the country started serving them, raised its popularity even more.
I need the soup recipe it looks bomb
emma’s forehead kisses make me so happy
I love how real she is with us and it literally feels like I am one of her friends

In the 1920s Americans ate very light breakfasts so doctors were persuaded to make eggs and bacon a breakfast food👏
"Maybe tomorrow will be better" YES

You know it’s crazy that when someone makes a lot of money most of the time they would live the rich life and move to LA. Idk if it’s just me but I feel like once these success has been done and you’ve accomplished the goals you feel lonely/bored sitting in a nice house with money. Idk I feel like Emma lowkey bored of living there idk open to discussion :)
this is actually one of my fave videos from her

Totally random, but the towel to the right of Emma @ 1:51 looks like slices of bacon to me for some reason, and I love it 🥓 lol
emma i think it was probably the color that made the other drawings look childish. tbh they could be a set .
omg so early
thought my cat was the only one who searches for crumbs in the sink
I was going to sleep after watching your video as it was my bed time ! But you are such an angel loved the video and thankyou for the forehead kiss 💋

Pesto in eggs omfg

Bruh I sit here and wait for you to upload a video on YouTube 😂❤️

this is a fucking petition to see ✨GOTHIC EMMA CHAMBERLAIN ✨  | V
Emma
Ok but I like her brown hair better than blonde

I love you she so honest like we all know we don’t brush our teeth every night 😂
Can we appreciate how cute emmas dad is?🥺
I literally got out of bed and took a shower
The cats on the kitchen counter got me triggered lmaoo
Just my *Favorite part* goshhhhh: "YOLO" (7:18)
You cope my depression. And I'm not kidding
anyone know where her lip gloss is from?
i could watch her do the same things in every vlog and still be entertained
emma please do a house tour. we’re begging you
Hi Emma, drummer here. Just wanted to stay that I don't cringe too hard at your drumming
Emma: “Alexa set timer for 20 min” 🤪😜😝  My Alexa: 😃
Emma is literally perfect and if u wanna argue with that then...idk go read a book.
Emma can you please make like a vegan buffalo chicken dip bc that is my fav thing to make like normal way. And I’m interested to see if the vegan cheese would mix up and melt like regular cheese does in buffalo chicken dip lmao
emma's dad is legit dad goals
her vlogs make me feel less bad about not being productive and doing weird stuff all day
I literally love Emma 🥺❤️
hi Emma please be my friend like genuinely
EMMA people who are good at the drums are PROUD OF YOU FOR LEARNING, not judging you for being a beginner!
Not me moving the phone towards my forehead for a kiss.  Thanks emma
Okay but I would buy that cat picture
I am really gonna take shower
emma if you did a series where you played stardew valley i don't think you understand how much that would actually pop off
URGENT TIP : don’t buy from goat if ur from Europe bc border taxes are hella expensive and u only learn from them once u receive the shoes. I once boat a pair of off white converses from them, and the tax service called us to tell us that in order to get the shoes on the French territory I had to pay 250 bucks, or they would be sent back to the us and I wouldn’t be able to get refunded so please take this advice into account
so i went on a jahg
what is emma's screen time-
I LOVEEEEEE EMMMMAAA
we love the druming
Hello
so are we gonna ignore the fact that every vlog is a cooking vlog now? okay chef emma ✋🥴
I’ve literally just been looking at the cat the whole time 😂
I really REALLY want her soup recipe now ☹️
I feel like we’re on FaceTime
Hey bestie even though I'm 9 years younger than you
About 20 years ago I had that fleece in reverse... blue with red detail.
You could try drawing/painting on your skateboard🛹
Seth Rogan makes pottery (vases and ash trays from clay or porcelain) haha, Something cool though and artistic
incoming face time call : emma chambie 🕺🏾
I think I would be much happier if I ate spaghetti for breakfast
god do i love your hair with this color!
no one: the magnet in emma’s oven: CAT
I either wanna be besties with you or be you
I like that now you videos are more chilled out like u can see Emma really living it
Tempe is a traditional food from Indonesia. It’s made of soy beans and it taste good.
You should do Korean steamed eggs! Im not the biggest fan of eggs but I really do like them steamed that way. You combine two eggs plus a yolk, a dash of fish sauce, and a chopped green onions. Then beat it all together ike you're going to scramble them. then add them to about a cup of boiling chicken broth, while stirring the eggs into the broth for 30 seconds. Turn the heat down to a low heat, cover with a lid, and cook until soft and fluffy . I top mine with black pepper and some red pepper flakes :)
Embaa you can actually say hey siri set a timer for e.g. 20 minutes , you don’t actually need an Alexa for that 🤣
hey gorl
Emma’s started drumming recently and she’s changed
10 mil subs here we come!
I wanna be Emma so bad 😔
im going to shower because emma says so....nothing else
emma chamberlain 2021, "i'm not brushing my teeth today....YOLO!"  brilliant
The cat was so cute tho

"I'm trying to decide whether or not I'm in a bad mood." -Emma  Why has that been me all of quarantine
hi lol
Hi Emma 🙋🏾‍♀️
—( omg 😭❤️   6:45   )—
Ily
my biggest flex is that me and miss Emma have the same pan I have a pink one too :D
as someone who plays the piano, no emma i will never get tired of u playing the drums cuz i like to see people who know how to play an instrument that is actually cool.
Ugh i love emma shes so funny💞
Your cat trying to go in the sink while u were eating breakfast is hilarious 😂🤦🏽‍♀️
We’ve been blessed with an early video from our queen Emma🥳
Make gulab jamun
Your drum beat sounds like ZZ Top Sharp Dressed Man 😁
i really feel like i’m close with emma through her vlogs recently 🤩 so happy to be one of her bestest friends
I don’t think Emma will ever understand how she makes me feel.
I was thinking why is she talking so fast but my speed was at 1,25 lol 🤦‍♀️
emma: ...because we’re gonna hang out today me: 🥺🥺
emma really called me out for not showering
okay, but can we please get the soup recipe
Me trying to think of a funny comment
The title of this video is literally the description of my entire fucking life
Can someone help : i am insecure  about having dark brown hair and eyes and my hair is straight
who's gonna talk about how fire she is w drums. like tf
Emma!  You set my Alexa to 20 minutes.. LOL, please edit out "Alexa" and just write in the screen..........  by the way I do wish I had enough counter space to have cats feast on it......  :)
Looked like yummy soup!!
I touch my cats😂😂😂😂😂
I’m hereeee ooof
10:12  currently going to have a shower and when i come back i’ll finish watching the video thanks for the idea emma lmaoo😭
HER HAIR LOOKS SO GOOD😍🥰🥰🥰
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE YOUUU
Hi
r u a vegan?? i’m confused coz u eat eggs but not cheese?
Like i dont even know what this video is but i love it for some reason
Who tilts their head down when she does a forehead kiss or put your phone to your for head? 😝❤️
BITCH I SHOWERED
Mezclar las harinas con la sal. Hacer una corona e incorporar los liquidos. Amasar hasta lograr una masa lisa. Cortar en bollitos y dejar reposar tapados en la heladera por 15 minutos. Estirar los bollos y hacer dos cortes en el centro. Poner aceite en una sartén y esperar a que esté caliente. Frei r hasta dorar y cuando estén calentitas (no cuando recién salen de la fritura), empaparlas en azúcar ¡y listo!
ma’am get hair extensions
Why was that video so short
I could watch her all day I swear
She got my damn Alexa going off😂
DIDNT EXPECT AN UPLOAD TODAY
Yey im 10 No but actually 🤭
This video was extra funny, ty
i feel ya queen i have meltdown every second day...and it has turned into a more often thing since the year started and its only JaNuArY
i loved this video
everytime it cuts to her playing the drums it kills me 😂, idky I think it’s just because she looks so still 😂
I do not mean to be mean but you really have a bad vibe. Always complaining or only looking at the worst. I love her though but I wish she could change and stop complaining.
Why does emmas personality match mine-
The alarm sound triggers me every time
every video emma gets closer to becoming a drummer in a girl band and i love it
In all serious I hope you're doing okay. Take some time for yourself and relax, take a break if you need to. :) <3
Omgggg it's 2:46am now and I still have a duty at 8am. Wtf emma! Hahahaha
HOW DID SHE KNOW THAT I WAS CONTEMPLATING SHOWERING? 😭
I don’t think she realize how much watching her doing nothing entertains us
The forehead kisses really keep me going
I literally can’t describe how happy I get when I see her videos, I feel like I’m going through everything with her while still being so inspired by her<3
the bit about being roommates with yourself hit hard
6:11 um emma u good?? is there a DEmOn? 👁👄👁
we love u
Emma looks so good,like literally just glowing. Emma literally always keeps me motivated to never drop my crown.
i love u so much emma
when emma said put on the face mask before u shower so u don’t have to wash ur face at the sink but she did it anyways
what if you tried walking in nature going on hikes?
it's the hair for me WE ALL HAVE BEEN THERE
i’m early, also i love u emma 🥺
✨Who else is waiting for a house tour✨
Not molded tortillas....
I LOVE YOU I ALWAYS WATCH YOUR VIDEOS AND THEY MAKE MY DAY <3
“trying to decide whether or not i’m in a bad mood”
what emma said about the recharging after a mental breakdown made me so sad because i realised that because of school i have literally no time for that. like. for real. i cant just take a day of and i dont think that will ever change
Not me hoping out of bed to take a shower 🤣
I honestly like watching you do the same thing it’s still a good video for me😂🥰
Where did you get your sweatshirt I love it
Emma servin looks with the brown hair 😌
Emma is literally healing my depression like 10 minutes ago I was out crying while listening to french music and now I’m laughing bc of her videos
here before 1 hour mark
the only person that makes me feel comfy
Love u Emma
that forehead kiss 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
I needed this today. 10/10 👏🏽
Loveeeyouu
On behalf of everyone we love hearing you play the drums
during the civil war ahaha. no they were eating hardtack.
Anyone else make soup in school ✌🏼🤚🏼😌
FRANKIEEEEEEEE
i love you emma❤️❤️❤️
2:54 "If you are under the age on ten you didn't hear me say that"  If you are under the age of ten you shouldn't be watching Emma Chamberlain
Emma, we love watching you do “nothing” !!! - I promise, we could watch you do nothing for hours on end
Putting on a mask before showering is the SMARTEST thing I’ve EVER heard. Emma you’re a legend😂❤️
Emma, I think your shins hurt when you play drums because if you have a hi-hat and bass drum pedal, both of those pieces require you to work your anterior tibialis (the muscle that runs along your shin bone that's used to bring your foot up from the ground). When I started playing drums that hurt on my leg too, I would recommend gently foam rolling it or even trying some stretching/pilates type exercises to strengthen it. I think it will help with endurance for playing. I love your drum content!!!
EMMA U PLAY THE SAME BEAT FOR THE DRUMS I JUST REALISED THAT LOL     oh wow ure learning a new beat nice
I watch emma every time i have a meltdown or just when im having the best day she just uplifts my spirits !
anyone else who actually paused the video and took a shower bc emma said so (and bc i felt disgusting actually lol)
emma has no idea how proud i am that she’s getting better at the drums every video
Emma's videos are my only source of serotonin
Emma need alexa
Love the personality!
Emma is such an old lady please 😂🖑
She’s about to hit 10k subs 😱
stop with that ugly iphone alarm sound every time i hear it my day becomes shit.
when she said “wE DiD it” after she went grocery shopping, 18:50 ,she sounded like Kamala talking to Joe on the phone
why r u so good at drums
omg emma cook LMAOO
CANNOT believe she is so natural on camera I love :)
You art is good like it's pretty
yessss 💕
girl... you need to go to an acupuncturist. TRUST.
the red fleece.
Wow! Emma is a drummer now🙂she has CHANGED
Honestly love her hair it’s so cute
I didnt mean to be this early...
i love that she openly said she has anxiety & handles it extremely well , someone i really look up to 🤍
I LOVE HER FLEECE so inspired to make a video like this ahhaha
У нас 22:42... Почему так поздно!!! Нет ну это нормально, но завтра в лицей и мне надо выспаться, я собралась спать, но увидела это видео и теперь не могу его не посмотреть! Ох, снова сбитый режим оооо даааа..........
Why is this vlog literally my life
Why is Emma convincing me to get a drum set? I couldn’t even play guitar hero to save my life but here I am seriously considering it..
emma i am obsessed with your cat drawing.
Your skin is amazing
All I wanna say is that I’m early for once.
when your playing drums, you should try to add a song in and make your own beat to it
Here before 20 mins
Can we just acknowledge the fact that Emma’s cat is trying to fit it’s head into the sink?
soup recipe now
Dude why don’t you take drum lessons ? You would be so proud of yourself after seeing your progression 😁
We all know she drew role model 😌
i literally cannot describe how much i love emma’s videos
3:51 the cat in the back: 👁👄👁
here before trending
In Spain we normally eat chocolate milk with cookies for breakfast, or toasts or churros with chocolate milk, or cereals, but definetly not eggs and bacon lmao
what a beautiful soul, if she stop giving us forehead kisses imma cry
i just feel so motivated after watching her videos lol
when she sped up her facial expressions while thinking about what to do for the day...I DIED
Emma's ability to depict all her daily emotions is incredible.   Even the typical, "I have indigestion" lol
Yeah the intro is fuckin relatable
there's never too much broccoli
🖤
Love you queen!
the amount of cameras she has is sad.  people r effed up
why in every video i see her cat lingering behind her on the counters😭
Can u teach me to play drums 👍🏼
I ordered your YELLOW WRAPPED HOODIE 👑

Hi I'm kinda early hehe
the way the cats came in the background of every shot
Damn what's wrong girl
dude watching emma makes me feel like im hanging out with her and it just makes me so happy
Also i adore emmas dark hair as much as blonde.. I personally think going even darker would be so cute
does anybody else think that emma should try other instruments, imagine emma playing the ukulele
1:57 it reminds me of taehyung

Why does Emma look like that horse loving girl but it’s kinda cute tho
why does every youtuber burp really loud? Like i’ve never met anyone outside of youtube who burps like that.
Your cats on your counter make me happy 🥺🤍
Sometimes I wonder what it feels like to be Emma’s cats. Just like watching her talking to herself all day. lol
Hi Emma, I love you so much!
This is a queen who knows how to deal with a pandemic by staying home 😙✌🏽
Why is emma the cutest little pea ever

i’m loving this video😭❤️
Your vlogs are so chaotic and I’m here for it lol

The knife advice really hit home with me .
I'm probably too old for her videos but she's just so naturally entertaining
Wait hold on, the large monitor of security camera angles is SUCH A MOOD.
I literally love u
emma needs to make a drum beat as her music in her intro that would be fire

Hi from England
You are my fav youtuber!! I also did a vid showing the planner you created:)
my favorite part of my sunday is seeing her video pop up on my feed
"I also have cauliflower I could put in there, I also have indigestion."
this thumbnail, title, & her hair reminds me so much of her old vids omg
i’m so obsessed with the vlogs
I wish I were this early for my uni classes😞
Hyram will be so proud to see u using sunscreen lolol

Greetings from South Africa🇿🇦

Not me happy asf bc she posted
Emma could make the same thing on every video and I will still watch every video 🥲💕
ever since I thought that emma as a brunette looks like timothee chalamet I cannot unsee it
queen
How do you have your own million dollar home and still complain about not wanting to do anything
ITS MY BIRTHDAY :)))
does Emma respond
yess i was so bores thankk youuuuuu❤ *bored wtf is bores hahahah
“i maybe exercise”?
earlyyy
Since Emma has mental breakdown and cries a lot, doesn’t have energy to shower or brush her teeth, I fear that she’s depressed 😭🥺🥺🥺 she even said she’s sad and depressed 🥺🥺🥺 I hope she’s okay 🥺💖
Earlier than a white family at the airport
I think she should move out of LA !
Hi Emma
It’s ok to have a meltdown, you gotta release those emotions.
Thanks Emma, i really needed that
This video is just a mental breakdown. Love it.
Emma need therapy, but is she going to get it....? Probably not
once Emma puts a Positive Title in her video, the world will end apparently
I just love rewatching her old vids and then coming back to the recent ones and see how much she grown and evolved
Emma is like the friend everyone wants
Yes
who else loves her dark hair
does Emma realize that every time she posts my day instantly gets better
if someone asks who’s my comfort yter, it would b emma chamberlain. no questions asked
I love the new hair color so much on her it's amazing 😳
freeze your tortillas so they dont mould! they defrost in like 30sec its great
It's like i know when emma is gonna post, im alwaysss early
I feel like I'm the only one who thinks she kind of looks like Maya Hawke...
Literally NEVER been this early in my life! This is basically the highlight of my week. Love you, Emma! ✌Stay safe everyone! 💕
Ever since Emma started drumming she changed🙀
Y'all if they said we were allowed to take hoodies form any youtuber , I would take Emma's hoodies ! Obsessed with her style !
Homemade tortillas , 1 cp flour, tblsp oil, pinch salt, enough water to make dough maleable. (Very small amount), roll out small rounds over flour,  on a flat skillet preheat pan to low, place round, flip when it starts to bubble and brown... voila tortilla
"Touch my cats" so quirky 🤚🙄
4:16  THE CAT BAHAHHAHA
QUEEN
there is a commercial in turkey about a chocolate it goes like ''sweetest mornings starts with the 'brand name'  *sweetest mornings start with the notification 'Emma uploaded a new video'* *
I love how she seems so much more like herself if that even makes sense
I love you
Did she move?
i love listening to emma play her drums because i’ve always wanted to learn but i never had motivation so now i can live vicariously through her
Well just be careful & don't worry ok? So stay safe & stay drive ay hey Emma my bestie queen bro lol I'm such a huge fan again
It’s always a good day when emma posts a new video
Are we ever gonna get a house tour or...
50k views in 10 minutes? Video is 22 minutes long smh, how is this possible!
EMMA I'M OBSESSED WITH YOUR PODCAST!
emma's like that older sister who's your second mom/ therapist/ bestfriend
I love the new sweater omg

I LIVE for the forehead kisses   Ps I’m a small youtuber let’s support eachother
You're really good on those drums girl 😉🔥💯

normal bodies : 60% water emma's body : 100% coffee
I'll never get sick of u playing the drums❤️
Emma made my 2020 better! PERIOD
WHY IS SHE ACTUALLY GOOD AT THE DRUMS
Just imagine to get a heart/like  from Emma...
just a question: are you vegan? or not? because every time you list all this vegan stuff and then you use an egg...i’m just confused 😂
Emma is my bsf and she doesnt even know it
Once again, I relate entirely to Emma’s Vid titles 😭

regarding the bacon breakfast thing. it was heavily advertised during the 2000's because meat producers dont know what to do with the extra fat of pork's belly. thats why we had a lot of weird bacon memes back in the day.
