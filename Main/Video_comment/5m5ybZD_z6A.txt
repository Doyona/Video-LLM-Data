Two greats having great fun and conversation.
Whoever filmed it should be sent to outer space and never return. Had to mute the video....
rogan uses oversized shoes.
I had no choice but to stupidly hide behind a tree like a chicken.
Elon musk sir, may you give me a clue to cure my motion curse?

He man castle grey skull God just told me….
That truck is a piece of shit lmfao 🤣 I always see them get towed n constantly see videos of ppl complaining about them or how shit breaks the second you take it on anything other that solid road lol so that ain't tough my guy. And 0-60 in 3 seconds is all great but when you do that you loose 10 miles in range lol which it barely has. The electric car thing is a failure nobody but morons buy those cars.
Biggest cybertruck add, I've said it and I'll say it again JR is the best sales man of these times. Cybertrucks are super expensive trash
Hey cutie 😂😂😂 that was 🤣hilarious 4:03
this is my kind of interaction w friends! Fun and spontaneous 😊
Rogan with that wig looks like He-Man
Its not bullet proof jerry rig proved it
"hey cutie. HEGHHEGHHEGHHEGHHEGHHEGH!!"
Ha💸ha💸ha💸ha💸ha💸ha💸ha💸ha💸
In USMC  URBAN training, or around vehicles,  only the ENGINE BLOCK can provide some  COVER for saf (7.62, 50cal, etc)  But now.......
Ill bet you a dollar....love that
4:03
4:03
Elon Musk is stuttering way too much, should talk more smoothly
Crossbow would go through easily.
It's not a truck it is a toy!
Which cigar is Elon smoking there exactly?
These two men got DJT elected in 2024! Fact.
God bless America!
No one is going to mention he aint slick
Elongated Musk is going to Uranus tonight
For you non-bow guys... An 80 lb. compound bow is no joke. Joe draws like it's a kids toy. That's some serious strength.
I own 3 cyber trucks
Elon is a funny weird mf for having all that money lmao. Hops back onto the mic with "hey cutie" . Seems like a top bro to have
FFS SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME WHERE THIS FULL VIDEO IS!! I can’t fkin find it
Joe can you send me one bow. We do not have bows like that in Bulgaria 😊
Elon and Joe, Trump, Harris, Jordan..they would not have the courage to let me interview them. I know, but they are to stupid and afraid and just make arranged, pre written, staged interviews. They are too narcissistic to show how stupid they really are. But they're massively good at sucking money from people. Elins wealth is 70% from peoples taxes
Joe’s Puerto Rico jersey is much funnier now
If you want to barf upload the clip of them eating pizza... Turns out at a certain level of wealth, you can openly eat food like a dumpster weevil.
The only reason to hide behind a car door is because bad guys don't often shoot through cover. There's just something mentally about it. I mean obviously if you can get some proper cover, or flee, that'd be ideal. But non-bullet proof cover is better than none at all.
The wild part? He just tripled the value of that Cybertruck. lol
What is this wig dude 😂
2:58 that rich person's laugh
Why is joe dressed like that
Joe looked so lit in this lol
joe throwing arrows at elon's cyber truck feels like an interaction between a chimp and a higher intelligence life form lol
That yellow wig is everything 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Whoever's holding the camera needs to stop chewing in my ears holy shit
People wonder why Joe Rogan's show is so popular 😅
A serious conversation with the wig. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
probably a $5000 paint/body  work to repair that small dent though 😂
cameraman be chompin' on that gum
Joe looks like he'd give a happy ending at the end of your massage
Puerto Rico
"I'll bet you a dollar"  So that's how the mega rich bet, and here i was thinking a parlay could get me serious money
This is why the internet was created
Elon musk truks are supose to be tuff right? Then Whistlindiesel blow the truk apart from the tow hitch? How offten do you get shoot at in your truk and how offten do you tow a heavy load in your truk?
Thank you Joe and Elon
Hands down Elon is The Gangsta
Hands down Elon is The Gangsta
Hands down Elon is The Gangsta
Joe Rogan is the most chilling cool dude on the plane 😂💪 we appreciate you joe 🎉💥
Hey cutie and then that laugh afterwards is EPIC =D
😂
this screams fragile masculinity
Imagine getting one of the most powerful guys in the world and just being able to chill and laugh and goof around with him.
but some people don't want an indestructible truck.  they want it to have battler scars so that people know you use it.  It's like jeep wranglers.  I had one out of high school and when i got it people want you to take it in the mud.  and then if it's covered with mud people are like "f yeah."   Imagine if you had a demolition derby or a monster truck rally with indestructible cars?  In a demolition derby people are enjoying watching a car still run with it's radiator blown and a bumper dragging.  In racing people enjoy trying to get life out of the tires and brakes, and find it interesting to extend their life or performance.  that's what the ford vs ferrari movies was about.  It was also a common theme in star trek where they keep calling scottie in engineering and he would tell them it's breaking apart.
AWESOME!!! LOL
How many other people have a crossbow in the closet at work? Anyone? HA HA HA love seeing grown men geek out.
He is full of shit I have saw various videos and multiple rounds penetrated the door ! The 50 cal’s went through it like it was butter !!!
Can't wait for Elon to drop the "not a crossbow"
If the rumour of cybertrucks being sent to occupied Ukraine to fight with mounted MGs are true.. how effective would they be at stopping small arms fire elon?
Con la camisa de Puerto Rico 🇵🇷💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
Compare this to Elon with Lemon interview....
Joe Rogan has the same hairdo I have right now.
This is what it's like growing up as a redneck
Elon just seems to be happy to have these type of lad moments with "friends"
So we’re going to double the weight on bridges in America? That’s gonna be funny.
A metal tipped practice arrow would have probably done better.
What wig is Joe wearing is it a Paddy the Baddy wig?
What a time to be alive
Joe looking like a roided Barbie while Elon looks like a 90’s William Shakespeare is mainy 😂
het cutiy
I deeply respect the Beast Mode version!😮
It's really nice to finally get my Joe Rogan episodes back. I had to cancel all things Google but I doubt this will last. Both great pals, Elon and Joe.😊
You know your rich when you dare someone to stick a arrow through your car
Why does the truck have to be bulletproof though?
The outfits make this 10x better😂
“I’ll bet you a $1” 😂😂😂 Says the current wealthiest man
Guys are just living life to the fullest! Two legends
Joe looking like Tom petty's mom, last dance with Mary whut?
I love that Rogan has more subscribers than Saturday Night Live.
Steel body with an aluminum frame is such a ridiculous design flaw.
Te A team made great use of bullet proof corrigated tin...
Imagine doing a dollar bet with Elon Musk
4:03 😂😂
Yeah but it's not so good at snow, ice, mud, hillsz😂
Can I have your our bow
So why is it important that a bow can pierce a steel reinforced truck vs a 308 not? Also... it didn't so I'm wondering if smaller is bigger was the missed theme of the video or if with enough money you can't kill me was the theme. I'm so confused 🍆😘🤯
This is a planned infomercial for Elon Musk's product. Don't be fooled!
Elon: slightly worse penetration then a 9mil  Joe: you know what now that I think about it I do have some broad heads 😂
Ellon got the laugh of evil villian.
I got more triggered by the chewing sound of the cameraman
Shoot at the glass
This is the most millionaire scheizer I've ever seen 😂,this is beautifully unrelatable😂
A billionaire and a millionaire betting on a dollar is the funniest shit
Can someone please explain what and why Joe wearing this lol
Elon is a Bond villian standing there smoking a cigar while his truck is being torture tested...I was waiting for a door to open and show a secret agent training room with flamethrowers and throwing knives, lol.
This video explains the male existence perfectly.  "Well, now we know."
Just make Elon the VP for Trump and Joe Secretary of State already... (joe must keep wig on the full term tho)
My dream is to get high with Elon and Joe and hunt with Steve and Joe and bring a high Elon with us.
Imagine atoms cant move, now imagine how a ufo could work.
"Ill bet you a dollar" says the richest man in the world to another multi millionaire
Imagine if Joe missed and hit his window😂
The title of this vid is something you type in a AI image generator 😅
Maan i wanna be able to say "joe rogan shot at my car". That would be so f'in awesome
How to be a genius and be the wealthiest? Read 100 books a month and watch all informative youtube videos. Build a rocket company to bring people to the farthest planet ..
The way elon bursts out laughing after warning joe to beware ricochets because he's that confident it won't penetrate is hilarious
Why are we talking about shooting crossbows in 2024?
Rich rednecks! lol awesome
The gum chewing
Awesome stuff love  the wig Joe😄
This one of my all time favorite Joe Rogan with Elon Musk. I can watch it over and over again I never get bored.😂
Joe Rogan archery is a martial art! JOE ROGAN could please get a hold of Elon Musk. I think the golf cart market could use TESLA GOLF CARTS worldwide! I'm so sick and tired of the weak ass battery golf carts that just can't barely make it around 18 holes. Elon Musk I bet could build better golf carts! There is a market!
He Man v Cyber Truck post apocalyptic Mad Max Bugout Vehicle.
Did the person recording have to chew gum
This is proof that we never really grow up
Why do they need solar power panels for a car or longer lasting battery, why has he not put an alternator or more too charge the batteries as you drive ? lol
Apparently the last time Elon watched TV was in the 80s, that "The A-Team " reference 😆😆
Listening to Jamie smack his gum is so freaking disgusting
Save Elon him from Joe 😭
Such a useful feature for when the poors try to eat you. Too bad you have to get out to charge it.
I love how elon is down like right now haha whenever he calls or get called out he's usually like "ok right now"
4:03 LMFAOOOO
2:54
O 👅 difícil esta este tal de inglês. Só de me esforçar a entender o que falam já me dá dor de cabeça. Na fala se coloca muito a língua entre os dentes. Difícil demais. Muito.
While you guys have your money invested into Tesla, a company that has not made investors money for 3 years, I have sold my tesla and am now making Piles of money on BITCOIN...I still believe TSLA is a good long term investment, but not right now..
zombie apocalypse car
"Stop it that tickles"   -Cybertruck
the thumbnail is what kills me😂😂😂😂
Is Elon into blondes?
Er, Joe - the blonde wig and big cigar make you look like Jimmy Savile.And you don't want to do that.
If Elon wanted to help he would be comfortable with 10-15 billion and spend the other 200-300 billion on really helping how sad it it when he sees the quote zombies
Wondering if it would have done better with a modern bodkin tip?
That was just BAD ASS....
Seeing Joe Rogan with a wig is how Elon Musk would visualize him while smoking a joint.
Ricochet back into Elon neck. Can you imagine. Would be bizarre like Crocodile Hunter
Yea we are going to need Elon Musk and Alex Jones to go on Joe Rogan’s show together. Please and thank you!
It can take an arrow but apparently doesn't do well against rain.
That Elon Musk laughter... omg
I saw the dent Mr. Joe Rogan.
Joe Rogan looks like asap shrader from braking bad
Joe is as tall as a 5th grader.
Love to meet you Elon over some coffee and a light breakfast. I'm not a smart person but I like to listen to you talk and hear your outs about making humanity a multi planet species. Honestly just one day to hang with you Elon would make my day!!!
Omg joe looks so fucking weird with hair lmfao wtf you look much better bald bro good looking guy but that fake hair wtf take it to your backyard and burn it joe pecsis hair plugs looks better joe
I would love to see Joe do the same but to a standard vehicle.. just to see the results v the cyber truck
Good to know during the apocalypse when I see Joe Rogan hunting humans with a bow I have nothing to fear in my cyber truck
The sparks man! No one mentions the sparks! *****
Why didn't he try a a 50 cal
1:35 getting so excited 😂
It says in the manual that owners have to clean the steel exterior daily so as not to allow dead bugs bird droppings or road tar and salt to oxidize and rust the exterior.  There’s literally no protective coating just raw steel.  Between that and the cars getting bricked in subfreezing temps, Tesla will go bankrupt.  Elon Musk is a fucking moron.
OH MAN, THE NEW DEADLY VIRUS IS CALLED DISEASE X.   SPACE X, X TWITTER, IS DISEASE X A COPYRIGHT VIOLATION?   POOR ELON, HE BETTER GET THIS FIXED SOON.
Elon and Joe together is very unpredictable!
It is impractical for parking and looks stupid. Simply a rich mans status symbol. It's a sad ripp off of the Delorian (stainless), what a pile of shit.
Heavy..
Why is he wearing that wig?
Watch engineering explained and you will see what a gimmick car this is
If he had kept the wig on he could’ve done it.
So many Joe and Elon meat riders. 😂
there is something seriously powerful about an autistic man when you make them high or drunk.
Come on it is for military contracts. EVs are quite
0:50 bro I need to get get ahold of me! I got some insights for both of us!
What a snoozer
Love the hair, lol
Elon knows that earth is a flat stationary plane of existence realm.
What the fuck
A rifle can shoot through the front of a vehicle and if it doesn’t hit the motor, the round could actually exit the back. It’s so crazy the ease it takes to severely damage a vehicle, these days especially. It’s cool to see something like this.. granted I’ll never be able to own one. Or any of the Tesla vehicles for that matter.
Is joe competing in BASEketball?
💖 !
The dopiest episode ever 💪
Sem palavras essa entrevista muito esclarecedora conhecimento e vida nos liberta sucesso boas festas es gigante que a pequena essa turma e a humanidade agradece por existir só uma ressalva não goste que apareceu assim bebendo e fumando diante de uma entrevista que muitas pessoas são te assistindo sim sei que não tenho nada haver com sua vida cada um faz o que quer com a mesma mas seu cartão de visita es preservação da humanidade e ao aparecer assim nada bom sim só quero seu bem sim e uma crítica construtiva sim sem o ofende lo
❤❤❤❤
As a working grunt, the tail gate can't even haul tree branches. Its a yuppie truck for guys that wax and buff it each day😂😂😂😂
https://youtu.be/U2nYBDQkhug
An Arrow.  That'll come in handy if I get attacked by the Sioux. 🙄
i think he lost me at the 'energy per unit area' calculation...
Joe: I bet a grizzly bear would fucking destroy that thing
After he shot the arrow the camera guy sounded like he was jerkin off or chewing gum? Jeez man!
FPS is FPS, even with steel pointed tip.  Not going to go through 16 gauge cold rolled steel.  ..Not if 9mm para can't.   Broadheads...That's a good one Joe.  ..Broadheads.  Hahahaha.  ..This is Elon Musk we're dealing with, Fool.  ..Laters.  I'm off to get me a Cybertruck and go do some John Dillinger shit.  Yeehaw!
for fuck's sake jamie do you have to chew your gum into the microphone
Imagine being Elon Musk’s nephew. That would be the coolest uncle ever.
I miss joes introduction in his video that says "Hello Freak Bi***hs" 🤣 before starting the podcast. 😂😅
the richest man in the world saying “i’ll bet you a dollar” is hilarious
Now if I could just fit my entire welding rig on the back of a cyber truck...
In addition to being a narcissist, Elon is a dangerous person with a massive ego and a catastrophic lack of empathy. Even his biographer confirmed it. This is not a combination we should celebrate.
He's finally heard of Robin Hood
I wish I had rich friends lol
Joe, Elon, bunch of rich bastards, smoking cigars, shooting arrows at Cybertrucks!! MY God, what a time to be alive. The best!!
Why didnt you ask wtf he was smoking when he designed that horrendous truck?
whos chewing on the camera
Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 thx Joe
that's pretty damn impressive
Now you owe Mr. Musk a dollar, sir 😂
Hey Jamie pull up the video of the bear beating the cybertruck door
So the Cybertruck is He-Man proof
That had to be a "set up for camera" moment cause i can't imagine Joe really believed an arrow would puncture what a bullet wouldn't lol.
Joe, My wife says you look like a retired He-Man with that wig on.
please make the camera man stop chewing gum. the sound is awful
try a sniper rifle, armor piercing .50
So a 7,000 pound truck is bullet proof?  Yes, I want to see the demo.
Tesla should get contracted to make vehicle for the Police!
My favorite part is 50% of the audio being the camera guy loudly chewing right in the mic.
Jamie pull up that video of that 7,000 lb. Cybertruck that got shot by an arrow and refused to go down.
Why and how s Elon a seemingly chill Everyman
Whys Joe got the wig on? 😆
why is Elon hot
Police Tesla trucks maybe?
but nobodys will shot in the door , try the window
a servant with money of the Freemasons, gatekeepeer
I love everything about this except the person sucking on the mic
I wanted him to try that arrow on the window. That would have been interesting
Cyber truck comes with bulletproof side panels nuclear energy reactor engine breathable air generator and everything necessary for WW3 in trunk. Wonder how much it will cost?
How long before bro YouTubers shoot their cyber truck vids come out?
Joe in Wig Blonde 😄😄😄 👍 MUSK  FancyRichGenius Multi-trillion 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,0000 000 000  000,000 Numbes Dollars JUST KEEP Going 🖐️ 2023  TESLASUPERGENIUS Said THE Future for Which I work for MINE , 🌎1 EV TESLACARFANCYFAST TESLACYBERTRUCK 😄 JamesStyle from SoCailfornia fancyDynamics 🇺🇸 SanBernardinoCity
Elon's crossbow is for shooting at castles 😂😂😂 not hand held..
Love the PR Jersey
Just to comment Cybertruck.. ugliest piece of shit, ever made
Awesome 👍
Joe don't know ballistics 😂
Elon turned into such a boring mf. Perhaps it’s because he has been forced into being very careful with what he says all the time. He talks so slow and dull. Boring as mf.
These two are comic gold
Cyber truck looks pretty cool tbh
So everyone is gonna ignore how he joe says "barely scratched it" and theres a bigass dent in the new thing?? 😂😂😂😂😂
Joe talking seriously while wearing that shit is fucking hilarious 😂
Mr. Rogan is soooo baffled by the money and wealth of Mr. Musk that he is oblivious to the low-culture anti-semitism of Mr. Musk.
I put a downpayment on 4 cybertrucks in 2020. I requested a refund on the, "fully refundable" deposits in mid 2022. They cancelled my production numbers and did not return my deposits. I have written them every month since and they don't answer the emails beyond their first letter of acknowledging my registration numbers. Has anyone else had a problem getting back their deposits. It's $600 Cnd. in this case. Not worth a lawsuit unless I can get a Class Action lawsuit.  Rogan looks better with hair.
That is good
Hey Cutie😂😂😂😂
Beast mode requires way to much battery power.. but yet musk says battery is no issue. A steel welder could weld this in a month... It's not difficult... You trucks suspension is way out of wack... Wouldn't hold up to tests in Moab. This truck better be a prototype.
This may be the best Rogan segment ever❤
We need a cartoon version asap
3:57 Pause it and imagine David Attenborough saying "And here we see where the neanderthal warrior understands that he needs to adapt to hunt down the bigger game animals" then right before u press play imagine, joe rogan as a neanderthal with the big jaw, strong eyebrows and big nose, saying "Jora make stronger arrow, stronger tip, Jora kill metal rhino" now press play and enjoy
Michael Keaton was in a movie called Gung Ho that focused on the manufacturing of vehicles. About him working for a Japanese company in the US and they were going to close their plant because they weren’t being as efficient and making enough cars as their Japanese counterpart. Good movie
The fear of ricochet would have had me behind a barrier
Elon smoking a cigar very good looking both
Good
i like this vedio
Very good 👍
Nice
Nice
Who was chewing the gum holding the camera bro 😂 you’re despicable
Can you imagine a cartel with a bunch of these ?
The 5.7mm has entered the chat
They enjoy them
Ill shoot it with the hunters bow  You all handle enslavement by blaming it on drugs, yet you all use them. Everything about your freedom is a brainwashed lie….  Who cares about what the weetbix credentials @Cern taught your make believe scientists, everything about your brainwashed form is wrong…. The sophisticated network of law & order needed to build Pyramids did more than make it possible to construct the architectural monuments, they also reproduced the broadcast cycles used for millenniums of Monarchial systems of enslavement. Knowing that our global laws, trade, lifestyles & trends were also formed from that architecture, shouldn’t we ask “why did they hide its form in the written religions delivered to us”. The Pyramids are aligned to the festival of Mithras & Saturn, celebrated in the northern hemispheres winter solstice. The height of the festival was the 25th Dec (mid of 15 day cycle), Chosen by Constantine as Jesus’s birthday, coinciding with Sol the Roman Sun Gods & Persian God Mithras festive day. Ancient Global civilisations worshipped the Trinity as Demons & Gods, as to the Father, son, the spirit etc, but astoundingly no basis has been formed from these fables, even though they have always formed into & ended from definitive events, Its practise proves that administration was platformed provocatively to promote and hide enslavement. 4000 years ago Enlil existed His name Translated as Lord Ghost
nice
3:42 the truck looks so big with Joe standing next to it!
Dang Elon, my brotha that 🦷 whistle @4:42 Was off the EQ Charts my G.
Thumbs up
I thought this dude knew about inertia a compound bow is going to fire way harder than a crossbow.
🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
It’s because he’s Blonde 😂
When you want everyone to know you don't know anything about archery.
I just love Elon's smile man
What's with the wig?
I love thank to build.
A solid steel arrow would penetrate it no worries.
Everyone knows broadheads are inferior to bodkin point tipped arrows for armour piercing. Sling shot channel 101!
Nice
Elon is a true Gangsta! Pew pew Pew pew pew.
Awesome
only Joe Rogan could drink scotch and smoke cigars with Elon Musk while in costume, only pausing the conversation to fire a fucking arrow in to the brand new Tesla SUV that nobody has ever seen before.
Elon sound like a lil kid having fun. Of course Joe had a extra bow haha
Elon sound like a lil kid having fun. Of course Joe had a extra bow haha
Is someone eating potato chips while filming this?
It's Elon's arch-villain cackle that did it for me! 😂
Maybe Garand Thumb can do better 🤔 😅
Going electric is the most dangerous thing that could ever happen. The new world with a new order is going to be absolutely terrifying. If people think it's bad or has been bad well lace tf up because humanity aint seen shlt "yet" and unfortunately we all get exactly what we deserve for continuing to obey and comply like children and consenting to all of their agendas.
The map is a "flat" out lie. Ask yourselves, why is it that nobody is allowed to go and explore the Antarctic? Why do the super elites go over there once a year? Everything is hidden in plain sight and the reason is because consciousness meaning once we all hear it and see it and we do nothing about any of it it then becomes our consent to say everything "they" do is ok because free will. We are all in hell already and enslaved and most of the human race dont care, everyone just says yea its just how it is cant do nothing about it but thats the lie they want everyone to believe because thats what keeps them in power while keeping us obedient slaves. Everyone is living in "their" fake internet matrix world as cyborgs handing our godly powers over to them free willingly. How? Well, this is why every piece of technology has a "power" button which means once you power it on you are free willingly consenting to hand your power over to live in their world instead of living in the real world we were born into. Why is it called the web? Well, because its being caught in the web the entrapment. Same reason money has webbing around the boarder. Weve BEEN in the beast system. Television is an entrapment and brainwashing. Television,  it is telling our vision what they show us. Its called a Television program because it is programming our minds through our vision. Now, it shrunk down into a portable smaller screen called a mobile phone. Humanity is absolutely doomed.
Nice
This video amazing so pretty impressive and nice intervene❤❤❤
Nice
where do I get whole podcast
Love this interview hopefully Joe has him back again
Man i love it when my cameraman chews gum so loud you hear it back on vid.
Whos the idiot chewing in the camera
Imagine if Bonnie and Clyde had a cyber truck
Does anyone wonder how big it is when joe goes to pick his arrow 🙄
The guy holding the camera needs to stop smacking his gum so we can hear Joe talking
order some pizza, they both were enjoying
Joe and Elon should start their weekly podcastsssss 😢😢😢
One must think the beast mode will be $100,000 at least.
did elon get his dollar?
Joes the only person who's managed to get elon to drink whisky, smoke weed and a cigar, he's like that bad influence you need to avoid but can't get rid of
Wo
Paddy shared a room with Elon and Joe. One day paddy disappeared so Joe and Elon called the cops. The cop asked for a description of the guy  what he was wearing distinguishing features ect. Joe said he was tall Elon said nope he was a dwarf but he had big blue eyes!! No way says Joe they were brown and he had lovely long hair. Get outta here says Elon he was a skin head but he had two penisies.. That's right Officer says joe he had two penises.. That's amazing says the cop and how on earth would ye know this? Well says Elon anytime we went to our local bar with paddy everyone would say here comes paddy  with the two prICks!
This episode is the best
This was the single most manliest thing I've ever seen.
Ellon to joe: Hey cuty 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1:48 the way he says I think I can get in there is a legendary Joe line
Never heard Elon laugh before
What a way to discover Joe is into archery 🏹
Saya tidak mengerti bahasa inggris
Drinking whiskey and shooting stuff…
"why did they stop using it" because ultimately the strength is help in the epoxy. Plastics (glass)interwoven fibres were far cheaper than hemp (a plant).  Combined with hemp's dependence upon harvest and crop yield. Not as stable supply.
where is the full interview
This episode is very good and awesome 🎉
Are the tires arrow/bullet/shot proof?
Is the full interview coming to YouTube?
Ice one
Not Cartman at Joe Rojan. Not Joe Rojan looking like He-Man. Yikes
Andrew Tate: What color is your Bugatti? Elon Musk: Is your truck bulletproof?
Very good❤
stopped watching when whoever is chewing in the camera started
Sorry Where is the full video ?
This guy can build a "Cybertruck" but can't make an SUV that can drive in the rain without the battery shorting out. Who the hell is he to say something like that isn't covered under your warranty? Don't support Tesla!! This asshole will make it to where if you need new tires, you'll have to replace the entire fukn car!
Nice video to watch
I'd love to have a crack at it with my 100lb longbow with heavy bodkin arrows
good
Rogan speaks the truth. A compound bow arrow will always be heavier than a crossbows, being a bigger projectile. And penetration is won by momentum which is primarily won by mass.
Nice one
So my question is who is going down on someone during the video?
80 lb bow is something most people can’t draw. Most of us use 70 or 65 pounds
There's a deleted scene where Joe flips a coin and tells Elon to call it.
I LOVE your podcast Joe! Greetings from Poland 🙂❤️
epic
What did Musk mean when he talked about “digging our own grave” with cybertruck?
Bro the way it starts 😂
That is the best
One of your best videos yet!! Captivating
After they shot the arrow, Elon said to Joe , "Hey Cutie." hahaha
Nice
Why is Joseph wearing a blonde wig??
Elon one of the most down to earth billionaires / science professors
The more Elon relaxes and has fun the more likable he is.
Let's talk about how there wasn't a medical crew ready. These were just dudes doing dude shit.
Hey cutie
I always thought speed is what will do it.
People who have ‘f*ck you money’
So whats the cost to fix the dent? 1 dollar too?
Seeing Joe like this reminds me of when they used a wig to disguise E.T. in the movie
Use a bodkin or piercing arrow, not a broadhead.
Joe looks pretty tiny. Whats he like 5'8? Ben Shapiro might be taller lol
Guess your bow isn't as great as you thought.
Elons laugh is becoming more and more super villain like every day
1. The truck is ugly 2. Elon says it’s about a half hour to get an 80% charge, but if everyone’s driving electric vehicles now you have a line of cars with a half hour wait. 3. How would an electric vehicle be good in the apocalypse?
Jimmy Saville trys what? Just talking
Can you fix the dent easily, I wonder? +Can you imagine if the broken tip went on and killed Elon?! Shiiiiiit!
Watch that ego boys
Where can I find full podcast?
Elon is the best
2:30 is simply wrong.  What matters is the pressure that is N/m^2, not Nm/m^2, N/m, or kg/s^2.
That truck is so ridiculously tough
Very good 👍
Good
"I get a bow with me"
😂 Americans the only place they will bullet proof a vehicle n shoot bows n arrows at it to show you how safe a car is 😂 smh what a waste of time
Gracias por estos podcast, enseñan mucho inglés
I wonder how many Cybertrucks were just sold via that awesome video!
but how are you going to repair the dents?
Bet  you a dollar 😂
Um Okay am I the only person who’s gonna bring up why the hell is Joe wearing that wig?!I I literally had to watch this 3 times and the last time with my eyes closed and phone turned upside down because that’s all I could think and wonder about.  Does anyone know what’s going on here?! I must know! There’s no reason or explanation as to why unless I completely missed something.. I can’t stop thinking about the wig. Maybe it’s shields Elong from being able to mind read joes thoughts. 👽🤷‍♀️ That’s all I got.  Joe please tell me why. It’s driving me bananas and stoping me from doing simple everyday tasks  🆘
Was that the broken window truck from years back?
Wheres the full episode?
"It shoots 520grain explosive tip carbon fiber shafted medieval ballista bolts with fuckin pterodactyl fletching, I'm getting thru that door dude" Joe Rogan probably
Hmm those could be useful during WW3 assuming the entire earth isn't radioactive atmosphere everywhere because then just drive where the air is safe to have a "long happy" life until BIGFOOT SEES YOU LOL!
So if anyone ever gets trapped in a Cybertruck, the fire department shouldn't even bother bringing their jaws of life?
When I first saw this I assumed I was watching a PINGTR1P clip...
3:03 why is the camera man LICKING the fucking microphone?
Deflection can make a big difference... I mean they don't make tanks square for a very important reason..
He-Man
This episode is the hardest I've ever heard Elon laugh
Jamie, great with Google searching. Terrible at filming someone shoot a cyberpunk with an arrow
Elon Musk saying he'll bet Joe Rogan a dollar is classic 😂💯
This some real rich shit
Excellent...so fun
Is that weed?
Hilarious 😅
This ma b the best Rogan segment ever
Good
I like how casual Elon is about this 😂
barely scratched it.... put a big dent in it.
So why’d you make it bullet prove?   Have you seen how fake those shoot out scenes are in the A-Team? That’s why.
Why wear the hair. If its for a disguise i feel like a beard and hat would be better.
I'll shoot my arrow through bullet proof material, ummm okay
This is why mainstream media is dead
dude on the cam is chewing GUM bro
Do we want a bulletproof car that has a beast mode? I don't know what happens when you need to extract someone from a vehicle like that and the jaws of life don't work too well, but it seems as though making something this unstoppable could end up being more dangerous.
I bet that @JorgeSprave from the  @slingshotchannel can get through it.. specifically thinking the airzooka would do it.
Perfect does it come in Black?
This may be the best Rogan segment ever
Elon smokes on live feed yet we’re not allowed to smoke at his facility!   Elon. Were tired of everyone smoking in the portacans!    Give them a place to smoke.
I love how they just chill eat pizza everything this episode you can tell Elon just wanted to relax and let loose this was great to see
Not going to buy a cybertruck!   This will generate a new trend of vandalism towards cybertruck.
Where can I watch the full interview
Camera guy needs to stop chewing like a cow when filming
Has the full episode been released?
God damn Elon’s laugh is annoying, what a tool
Where we can find the full podcast except spotify
man how can anyone not enjoy Elon
😬 It was probably moving 275 feet a second😬
Two Things are undeniable. 1 - Cyber Tuck can stop arrows. 2- Joe and Elon are Butt Buddies.
Presidents and mob bosses are now probably very interested in these cybertrucks
I don't understand
Excellent
The fact that Elon is in his pyjama's is even more funny. Like to 2 frjends who talk and chill. So awesome
Good
Which episode of the Broadcast is it?
👍
When Elon talks it sounds like ASMR  fucking grosses me out 😂
dafok is with the ad reads in the middle of the conversation in the elon musk episode?
I thought he was gonna go for a window like the product test😅
This may be the Rogan segment ever
Yeah, their still alive yet they both look like covid has ravaged their DNA they look like they have had covid like 20 times already. Think im lying just Look at there before and after covid pictures they have bags and mass wrinkles and im not even sitting next to them imagine being there. SHOULD OF WORE THAT MASK JOE & ELON
The car door thing isn't exactly true though, Older cars were made with thicker metals because the manufacturing techniques were not as advanced and weight was not seen as something that needed to be reduced as much. With thicker metal you could conceivably hide behind a car door easily. Also the more common caliber in use would have been the .22 LR which has significantly less penetrative power compared to something like 9mm today.
" WE CAN TRY IT RIGHT NOW IF YOU WANT" DAMN HAHAHAHAH ELON FUCKING MUSK
Fire the guy that filmed that while chewing like a hippo
Joe all that stuff gets destroyed in the bush
What's a Cyba truck
So does the stronger exterior equal better crash protection? If not what's the point it's not an embassy car. If so you better not get hit by one it'll probably tear through your car like butter.
Don't really need to be that smart to be rich.
Taking low caliber bullet proof vehicles  by making a truck, that is a 10th of the cost , genius move. But i bet the next thing that happens is use in armed forces like the hummer
3:33 yes, this is totally safe
of course it wouldn't penetrate it, joe just wanted an excuse to shoot his car
Elon is pure genius 24/7
👍
Cyber car? Is there gonna be a cyber car!?
Elon saying I’ll bet you a dollar😂legend
Damn joe was hammered when he shot the arrow and tried to explain stuff..
Always gotta be a cameraman who chomps gum in the background
4.2m views?? That’s double what the Cowboys v Eagles video game got.
Boys will be boys
Amazing 👍
Why do joe look like XQC if he was 40/50🤣🤣
Where is the full podcast?
This dude is the richest man alive...yet he is and can have the most chilled conversations! Elon Musk is the only billionaire I'd like to chill with
So what happens when the cyber truck collides with another car? Is it going to absolutely explode the other car? There’s no way that thing is passing crash testing
Joe Rogan, the kid your parents were worried about you hanging out with.
I thought the point was to shoot it at the window. Not the solid metal door.
That truck looks so damn fake. Even Joe shooting it looked straight out of a video game.
regulate guns? nah make the cars bulletproof
Haha just guys being dudes
eLON MUSK doesn't care if u hit his car.. he can repair it on his own FACTORY hahaha!
Joe is looking like a He-man toy
Why is no one talking about that awful munching from the cameraman
Who the F is munching that hard
There you are winthorpe, one dollar.
Roman Ballista: hold my beer!
problems millionaires have. and people say money doesnt bring happiness.
https://youtu.be/gk7iWgCk14U?si=6sYlfXx6NkvEpcOx
Can u load the bed of your cyber truck with a load of sod or rocks and still carry all the passengers. This vehicle has to be he dumbest vehicle ever made
I wonder what a full size man’s 90 lb bow would do you know with a 31-32 inch draw length
Seeing joe with hair is mildly disturbing
I imagine these will be popular with law enforcement agencies.
Wow awesome video ❤
Joe reminds me how fun it is to laugh at dumb jocks.
❤
4:03 hey cutie 😂
Elon is the man 👏🙌✊
Joe needs to bring Elon and Joey Diaz on at the same time. That will blow the internet.
Elon just seems like such a great guy to hang out with. What a brilliant mind. Anyone who lives in a democrat city needs to have that truck to protect themselves from the rampant crime. I can just imagine all those professional progressive protesters who jump all over your cars and try to break your window get frustrated when this truck plows right through them.
joe why would u not invest in changing the theme of the podcast room? wuld look more entertaining
I would buy it if it was diesel. Let’s be honest.
Elon sounds like he’s got massive cottonmouth with all that smacking.
Try the windows next.
if it is bulletproof why does joe think its not arrow proof? lol
I dont wanna give it all away- you will have to wait another 5 years before we reveal how fast it will go.
Joe looks like Bruce Willis for some reason
Elon got a free demonstration video performed by Joe Rogan himself. Top tier business move!
ELON MUSKS LAUGH REMINDS ME OF WHAT THE DEVILS LAUGH WOULD SOUND LIKE. IF I EVER KNEW THE SOUND OF A SINISTER LAUGH.
Wuts up with Joe rogens hair?I miss something?
I don't think there's a stupider idea than daily driving a 3-4ton armored truck for absolutely no reason 🤦‍♂️ Who tf will fire at you? Where tf do you live?
LISTENING TO MUSK IS LIKE EATING GLASS ... I HAAAAAAAAAAATE HIM LIKE NO OTHER... HES THE FKN DEVIL... BE CAREFUL PEOPLE
3:36 sparks fly off the cyber truck from the ricochet.
He looks like a Heman
U wanna good get-away vehicle after robbing a Bank tesla to the rescue. How long till we see this on news un a high speed chase and no u can't disable it remotely pretty easy get rid of that
Fcken awesome
Elon's laugh is fucking TERRIFYING so goofy it hurts my soul
Where can we get full interview
Imagine what that car would do to a human pedestrian. My guess is it won’t be produced (or allowed) on the European market.
Joe eats exactly like you would expect and it’s horrifying. Dude, it’s ok to not do every single action at 120.
Elon is quickly becoming our Batman of the 21 century
Wow ❤❤❤ very nice video 👏👏👏
Elon musk is really a down to mars guy:)$
3:05 cameraman loves that gewing gum in hes mouth
Ok, Pure horseshit. The broadhead was a flimsy piece of fragile, brittle, super thin metal. And the shaft is what? Carbon fiber? Not a god damn thing showed the "survivability of the cyberskin vs a projectile shot from a bow. The Arrow that was shot was wonderful tech designed to slice through the pudding of a deer.     A very low cost target arrow with a target tip would have transmitted much more energy into the fiber skin. Elon should have pointed that out. And a video of some heavy fiberglass target arrows be shot to show the ability of the cyberskin to protect passengers in that situation... I'd also like to see how well the glass would perform against arrows.
Love when the camera man is smacking his lips on gum stfu dude lmaoo
Is Joe morphing into Jimmy Savile?
Two very successful men and Elon says  “I’ll bet you a dollar”
4:03 Elon: “Hey cutie” 💀
Elon is essentially selling armored vehicles to the armed masses.   It’s actually ingenious.
Elon: I’ll bet you a dollar. Joe: Why only a dollar? Elon: I’ll bet you your net worth. Joe: A dollar it is.
If Elon Musk would start a podcast, the world would be healed.
the asmr gum chewing is really annoying while trying to watch joe shoot the arrow.
You'd have to be an idiot to want that ugly thing, but then.. they are going to vote Trump president again, so it'll be a great success.
He really is the little dude , Joe .
the camera guy chewing gum while they shooting arrows at the cyber truck no bueno
Something this impenetrable can’t be that safe in an accident. You need energy displacement.
my favorite part was the camera man chewing gum with an open mouth
I wonder how long before we cyber trucks driving around with isis flags and an cannon on the back
I looked at the video of his shot in slow motion. Can someone explain to me why the door of the car seem to indented a few milliseconds after the arrow make the impact? Why not exactly the same time?
Almost my favourite guest. Super interesting guy.
Elon needs to push in the energy sector harder as a pioneer of energy efficient products though it may be arrogant of me to say his products are the future of innovator's not investors
Where can I watch the full episode of this on YouTube?
The birth of Skynet. Humans attacked 1st.
I don't know much about arrows, but I do know that I don't need a bullet proof truck.
Nothing like 2 rich friends talking about savage shit lol
Love it . Joe is talking bows and thinking about the arrow as a bullet, Elon is talking the lighter quarrel and thinking of straw forced into a barn from a tornado.  I need THESE questions on tests..... That result is impressive as hell. At these ranges arrows hit harder than bullets.
Puff puff 💨
this is what it feels like to chew 5 gum
Dude idc what anyone says elon is awesome lol like shoot my car, hey where's your bow? Your house? Can we get it now? Lol pizza? Can we order some now?😂
He-man
So cool 🤩
I thought this was a fake edit for a moment but nope this was real 😂
well staged ,, at 3:36 there appeared to be sparks that were probably from the arrow tip, because stainless is kinda gummy compared to the carbon steel arrow tips
Something about Elon saying “I’ll bet you a dollar” when he literally has 200 billion of those made me laugh
Lol Elon's villain laugh when he shoots the door, you can almost hear him touch his fingers and say *excellent*
3:03 didn't know this was gonna be a mukbang video...
Did the cameraman have to chew gum when filming? RIP headphone users. XD
Which savage is chomping gum that close to a microphone?
The ricochet was wild!! 😮
I cant believe that Joe got hair implants 😂
This is why you hide behind the wheels not the the doors
Well if I drive the cyber truck in the 1700s I will be safe…. Minus the whole charging thing…
His lil legs with them long ah boots. Aww joe
Wow!
Why there's no one talking about joes hair 😅😅😅
Joe Rogan is such an odd person to be with so many kinds of people.
Joe!  Dude!  wear safety googles next time.
Yo, chew your gum with your mouth closed!
Remember kids, safety is no accident!
Well now we know remix is out now! https://youtube.com/shorts/RBVBXzSbiZM?si=4jBy3CHPjPr3CHHd
I had a mini cooper that  I got shot thru the door by the metal on top of the window and it didn’t go thru
Most gangster podcast EVER
The camera man must be chewing some delicious gum 3:43
WHO TF KEEPS CHEWING IN MY EAR IM ABOUT TO LOSE IT
Who is the absolute dingus chewing gum while filming?
If a 9mm bullet or a 12 gauge didn’t penetrate, why did he think an arrow would? 😂
what an ugly car
Probably we will see a lot of demolished cyber trucks on the roads after its finally produced at scale. Its going to be crazy! Like after the battlefield. Bullet holes, arrowheads from super heavy compound crossbows, dented with big metal fists, lazer. plazma. Let's not forget its got batteries inside!
crossbow ? why not
Almost 1 million views per day...
So when do we get our 30,000 dollar bulletproof, with shatterproof windows, can float and save us from hurricanes/tsunamis, pull more, haul more, drive more cybertruck?
Joe trying to tell Elon that the arrow is better
Gotta have @Eminem on, never heard @Joe Rogan freestyle? epic view
Elon left this podcast to have an AI Safety Meeting with the UK Prime Minister.   Dude is a boss. Or a CIA PsyOp. I haven’t decided yet 💀
Somebody needs to tell Elon Musk that the average American wants a daily car for the price of $10,000 on average.
“Hey cutie😏”- Elon to Joe  🤣🤣🤣
That truck looks huge next to Joe Rogan, I thought It would be smaller
THE Joe Elon podcast. They have good chemistry 🧪⚗️
Tell the idiot filming in the garage not to crew gum in peoples’ ears.
Man I have so much respect for Joe being one of the only people on the planet who can make Elon this comfortable
Nobody talking about the wig 😂 its all about the normal things
That joes home garage?
Every car company- no we can’t do that for a heap of pathetic reasons…. Elon - That’s a great idea , we should do that and thinks the possibility of driving with an arrow sticking out the side would be funny .
I want what Elon is smoking!!!
Who's the n'wah chewing gum next to the microphone?
I wonder if in 30 years terrorists will be using cyber trucks instead of Toyotas.
The cameraman rolling a jolly rancher around his mouth during filming is obnoxious.
It is time to sell your G Wagon! 😂
“Hey cutie hahahahahaha”
Tupac would still be alive
Hey cutie hahahaha class
People get so angry that he chooses to build non gas powered cars
Joe bowgan
You could take the gum out of your mouth you dirty savage
Joe looks like He-Man from the cartoon “hey…what’s going on?”
How does it crumble in the crash?
oh man THANK GOD the dumb fuck chewing 14 packs of gun was the guy holding the camera, holy fuck stop breathing man 3:01
https://youtu.be/32FB-gYr49Y?si=PkWB7Naz3uybSZXH
Someone is chewing gum like a Cow
Where is the full video of this podcast episode?
Joe’s out here lookin’ like He-Man
Nice to know if I buy one I'm safe from active archers
Elon has this laugh that makes you want to instinctively dive for cover under the nearest table.
joes mad it didnt go thru
I think Elon musk is trying to give the common man a means of protection in case of a government or AI  takeover. Just think of how easily these can be converted into warthogs.
SHOOT THE WINDOW JOE
Looks like Tony out of Rise of the foot soldiers 🤣
I’m buying one
Joe doing PR for the richest douche bag on the planet is pretty sad. Opposite of speaking truth to power.
How do u not like this guy
Love Elon and all he does (that I know of😅) but aren't crumple zones w safety feature of vehicles? Of course air bags are another safety feature but doesn't the crumple zone lessen the force of impact a rider will have with the air bag? Obviously I'm no scientist and let's be real. People just need to start being better, safer drivers and we won't have to worry about it. That of course is a false hope.....guess I should answer my own question and look up the cybertrucks crash test videos and information
I can't take him seriously with that wig, when he keeps adjusting his fringe, and the fact that he looks like he's rolling on molly, I'm sat here pis*ing myself 🤣🤣
Is it me, or is Elon Musk looking more and more like a MeatCanyon cartoon?
I know im stupid about this topic but wouldnt an arrow be weaker compared to a bullet? They already addressed that bullets dont penetrate so why would they even consider arrows? Pure curiosity not trying to be slick or sth…
The sound of them eating pizza made me stop the podcast and listen to something else. I was already going to stop listening when Elon supported pharmaceutical commercials (If what they advertise is actually true) WTF! Yeah, The side effects at the end that they say really fast are true smh
Elon loves Joe I walked passed Joe at the Comedy store, got the chance to tell him I love what he does
my favorite part was when they shot the arrow and all i can hear is the guy chewing gum behind the camera, nice
WHY IS JOE ROGAN BLONDE ??? WHERE IS THE FULL EPISODE ??? THIS CLIPS IS TOO SHORT ! I NEED 3 HOURS OF THIS !
why didn't he shoot the glass?
AND ELON HAS OBVIOUSLY HAD HIS FACE STRETCHED AND SEWED BACK INTO HIS FAKE HAIR
Joe owes Elon $1
assuming it cant take a 7.62x51 right? or even x39?
Elon Musk: "I think we dug our own grave with the Cybertruck"
Is it too late to change the design to make it better on rough terrain? If this is supposed to be a civilian tank then it should be able to go off grid.
to the dude behind the camera munching on the gum like no tomorrow. Thanks
Hey cutie Elon fucking rocks
Wealthiest man In the world kicking it on a podcast smoking cigars. Most chill man you don’t see the Rockefeller’s doing this ever.
You could be the smartest man on earth, arguing with Joe about bow hunting is probably not going to go your way.
Its a neat feature but wait until you get into a high speed wreck. Theres no crumple zones.
Absolute bellends
For years and multiple presidents and multiple Joe Rogan appearances….the cyber truck gets more hype but yet still isn’t fully released to all the people that made the down payment. How many more years until this happens? It was supposed to be released years ago originally.
This new He-Man series is weird
An arrow is heavier than a bolt??  Joe, Comeon… I expect better from you. Shorter yes, not generally heavier.  Good talk
Dude Elon is the best fr
The choice of narcos and drug lords the world over…
bro talks like he's on the edge of a nut at all times.
Joe thinks bows are more powerful than crossbows! 😂  Smokin that icky sticky.
Joe walking up to the truck was so fucking funny he looked like a toddler
The internet will never be the same 😎😎😎
I knew my refined taste for pineapple on pizza was justified.
Hey cutie 😂😂😂😂😂❤
no safety glasses thats beast mode
Velocity is king, it's why .223 cal at close range punches through armor plate targets like a laser while .50 cal just dents the hell out of it.  Physics ftw.
As ugly and impractical as Cybertruck is, I definitely see it growing on the public in the years to come.    Mark my words, and we'll see how well this comment ages, Cybertruck is going to be successful. 1st couple years might be slow, but I personally think after that it'll take off.
Awesome!!! 😀 👽 🚚 👍
Chomping that gum like a cow chewing its cud.
I love when these 2 are together we need a full on weekly series of Joe and Elon. So what down payment I need for that truck
Joe has a thick tail facing down to eat from the grey circle ✌️
Ummm a 9mm and a 45acp are basically a  10mm? Okay science betch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyFfo4XKURU
Armored doors. Truck just gets better and better.  Who ever was operating the camera needs to learn to chew gum with their mouth closed. Just about ruined the video.
Now they need to test the Cyber Truck against a bear... Jamie, pull it up!
Gung ho Micheal Keaton
300 stainless steel should not cold spark like that. What's up? Is the skin not what it's touted to be?
Now we know
Make it stop 55grs. At 3260fps lol. Thats the real test
Talk abt a person who puts his money where his mouth is.
Watching Elon Musk smoke a cigar while Joe Rogan shoots his truck with a bow is one of the greatest things I have seen
You all acting like this is a first army tanks🧐🤔🙄🤨 not to mention,HEMP CARS, that was created back in 1941 can challenge this any time⚡⚡⚡
that bow is like 65% as big as joe lol
Cyber Truck is fucking joke
It will be interesting how many customers actually test their cybertrucks this way after purchased?
Pray for them, the DNC is trying to take them down.
If I won the lottery, I think I'd buy one.
If you collide with a cyber truck on the road, you're toast.
why tf's he wearing a wig
no fire arrows?
Elons so relaxed.
Joe rohan sure knows how to aim
Elon "I'll bet you a dollar" Joe "damn"
This was a bullshit session between two guys who have lost track of "real" issues. I usually am totally mesmirized by both guys but this one is so "nothing" that it felt like I had wasted some time.
Ok, so they made a fake one for the Rogan Show. I bet this one doesn't even drive.
Elon was getting flashbacks to the metal ball to the window embarrassment
Hy cutey😂😂
Amazing thank you
I relate so much to these guys. It's so cool bro. It's so it's so me man! I swear man Joe Rogan is the legend bro! I was going to be mad that he was wearing a wig but I kind of like the boner it's giving me. So I'm going to say it's pretty cool and I don't know about you dude. But I completely relate with all the real life everyday things these guys talking about. That's why I relate with them because every single day bro I'm hunting polar bear, falcon, pterodactyl. Whatever else I think would be cool and then I'm jumping in an ice bath, smoking a $5,000 cigar and eating a $700 tomahawk steak for 2 seconds. Then I'm throwing it away and then I'm going to go kick it with Mark Cuban and Dana White, polish off this half o of blow...maybe bang some thai ladyboys... Fuck man if that doesn't sound like my normal everyday Tuesday night bro... Why I get Joe bro. I just get him. And he gets me. And I like my boner. It feels real...blonde...silky, shiny blonde...
HERP A DERP A HERP BLERP...  LET'S GET TOGETHER AND TALK SHIT SO THAT ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THAT WE FORCED TO BE SLAVES THINK WE'RE THE COOLEST FUCKING CRAZY WILD DUDES BRO MAYBE YOU CAN WEAR A WIG! WE'RE SO FUCKING RANDOM LULZ RAWR XD  GOD DAMN YOU FUCKING PEOPLE ARE FUCKING PATHETICALLY PREDICTABLE...HOLY SHIT
Well I don't know anything about arrows, but I would expect an arrow to get destroyed hitting any car or truck, so I don't get. Shoot an Uzi at it and show me there's no damage. That I understand.
All high level drug dealers around the world: SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!
A .22-250REM rifle vs. the CyberTruck would be interesting!
The Cybertruck seems perfect for criminals. It's going to be new Escalade.
If it is bulletproof, does it still crumple in a crash? Otherwise it is actually less safe than a traditional truck.
I love that Elon is like a kid at the playground with the what-ifs and then has Richie Rich cash to make it happen.😂
Elon is selling bullet proof cyber trucks?
I gotta say… I like Elon after seeing this… Definitely seems like a chill dude… And obviously a very smart individual.
Love this so much.  Elon so willing to test his own work in front of everyone. This guy is a boss
Thank joe for showing love to Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 los rubios 🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
I want one.
".... ... i bet i could get in there... ..."
Why is wearing a short blonde wig?  Has he lost it or what's the deal?  Sidenote: (has nothing to do with this.)  I honestly think that celebrities of all kinds, whether it's an actor/actress, political figure, athlete, etc., when they get a certain number of years in their popularity, they seem to think they can give their opinion about something (mostly political) and honestly most people don't care about it and couldn't care less about it. Sorry.
Sorry Elon. Electric vehicles are shit and aren't practical, especially in a country the size of the US.
Musk always sounds like he has far too much saliva in his mouth and it makes it impossible for me to watch without throwing up. Did Rogan shoot the arrow at a window?
evil laugh
Lmao he said I will drive back to the house with an arrow through it.
Now try the window😂
Wtf with the chewing, god damn!!! 🤮🤮
Elon is cringe
Jesus the guy filming please close your mouth bro
They sound so cute and slow while drunk 😂
Just two dudes talking trash like guys do.
Sorry, been distracted, why is Joe wearing a wig? And those ridiculous clothes?
Jamie sucks with the camera holy crap
"Oh Joe Rogan you crazy"        - Tyrone Biggums 2004
Musk is like a real life Tony Stark...
*I bet I could get in there*
Musk has the dirtiest old man laugh I've ever heard in my entire life.
when the CT program in Tesla is in tail-spin, only an arrow test would help....what a shocker...
Nice little spark
Where to watch full interview?
Joe and Elon would be awesome to party with!
Lol Elon loves joe bro brings him back to being human and I’ve notice Elon can never say no to this bad lil kid lmfao 🤣
lol 0-60 in 3 seconds for a pickuptruck with body armour....totally realistic...
I’ll bet you a dollar
Lol Joe really thought he was stronger then a 45
Elon is such a down to Mars guy!
Great Halloween 🎃 episode! #stayepic
That’s cool and all but what’s the point of being capable of resisting an arrow?
Thought that was Terry stone 🤣
Yall are my kind of people.
Proper Illuminati discussion - one wearing a blond wig the other smoking cigar and wearing a satin scarf - 'I bet I can shoot a hole in your car with my powerfull bow' 'I bet you can' - 'Can we get someone to summon your bow and sort this argument?'
Nobody tell Joe that's the 1-of-1 prototype 👀
Hey cutie lol
We need more Joe's ppl that want that answer n enjoy life
I finally get it cyber truck will be police  patroling vehicle and maybe also military truck with some mods it is like modern version of Humvee.
Hahahaha that is insane!!
where can i find the full podcast?
TEAM RUBIO 💪🏻🇵🇷⚾️👨🏼
Bro is getting ready for a zombie apocalypse 😳
"I'll bet you a dollar" - The richest man alive
“Well now we know” 😂😂😂 4:07
What's with the wig joe. Why are you making a mockery out of some people. Or do you just want to participate in drag. You're like Marjorie Taylor Greene you are deep in the drag, but at the same time you don't want the drag?
PAY THE MAN HIS DOLLAR 😂😂😂
No shock a South African made a bullet resistant vehicle.
They're so cool
Would that arrow penetrate a normal car? Feel like an arrow wouldn't puncture through any car's metal door...
Bow rogan Failed
That was fun to watch, but I’m sure the A-Team would have armored their doors a little bit… lol
Somewhere around the 2 minute mark Elon Musk got extremely close to making the first Tesla bow
The Mossad told Rogan to make fun of some fat woman in Philadelphia because she likes to be critical of your sons and daughters dying for the Likud party. Don't be too critical folks because the Mossad will get you.  Only people in positions of power are allowed to be "bullies".
I'm guessing law inforcement agencies are looking at the Cybertruck as addition to thier fleet right now lol
Team Rubio!!!❤
Lol, if anyone uses this as an actual truck the automatic tonneau cover is going to break the first time someone bangs anything heavy on it.  Stone, gravel, lumber or sand will clog it up.   The compartment under the bed will be useless. Once water gains entry to a ding.   The engine seems impressive, but the design is possibly unusable in real practical terms.
Darn Elon aged a lot this year. I guess things ain't going well...
Why is he wearing a wig?  Or do I really want to know?
Elon. Is an idiot.   Groupthink can be a horrible thing.  Ask the Challenger astronauts.
His hair 😅😅😅
Duddeeee’!!! He would be the perfect live action he-man.
The combination of an 80lb compound bow plus a steel arrow head will produce about 100ft-lbs of energy much less than a 9mm 400ft-lbs however the sharpened steel tip will penetrate better than any handgun caliber lead bullet. That truck is impressive.
That was so so soo dangerous
Men are supposed to be tough. Trucks are just trucks.
Beast mode conflicts with all that tobacco bruh
What cigar is Elon smoking?
Elon looks and laughs like a wealthy businessman
If you buy a cyber truck you’re gay
Nice shirt Joe 🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
Best car advertising ever!
Listened to the whole podcast on Spotify yesterday. It was amazing. Great to see the arrow shot. 😇👍💪😎
This is an amazing advertisement for the cyber truck. I bet Elon had that thought all along. They probably got a flood of orders after people saw this.
Kinda serious conversation you have when stoned to death....very funny indeed
This is what alcohol looks like.
Joe rogans a fkin coward for not talking to trump.
Man that's soo badass
maybe Musk should donate that car to Robert F. Kennedy jr. since Biden refuses Secret Service to him....
Man I like Elon and Joe 🤘
Why is Joe dressed as a woman? Did he sell out too?
Lol elon is the only auto manufacturer ceo that would be like yeah i bet it will stop an arrow, before the truck is even released then do it a few minutes later without talking to PR, leagal, or the board. Awesome, but hey he was right it did stop an arrow
why joe didnt have someone run to his house and get it is beyond me
Joe trying to argue with elon about crossbows not being powerful is hilarious like joe seriously you are a child
I bet you $1 💀
Future police cars...Maybe that is his plan B option with the Cynertruck! We might seem them as police cars in exotic countries if not in the USA
what's with the blonde wig
Hey cutie nyia nyia nyia nyia
Elon laughs like a billionaire mastermind who’s trying to take over other planets. Oh wait..
Hey Cutie😂😂😭
Ohman, how much would I like to live in that world. "Wanna shoot arrows at a Cybertruck?"  "Sure, why not?!" Prbly each of these cigars is more expensive than my car.
Elons the Top G
what are you tlaking  about, it dented the car
Joe Rogan as He-Man?   What's going ON!?   & I said, HEEYYYY HEYYY HEYYY YAE YAE.
nice broadhead test joe  try  multiple broadheads my money might be on muzzy
Dibs on Beat mode version.
Hey camera man your munching mouth sounds were so unpleasant it did hurt my soul.
I like Elon inspects it probably calculating the area of impacted and how to avoid that damage in the future lol. Not sure I’ve ever seen him test without it ending in him trying to improve the outcome. Even if it was a success 😂
This is great advertising
Did the camera man wash his lense with sopy water?
Feels like the broken arrow head could have been dangerous
The richest man in the world let a guy wearing a blonde wig shoot his truck with a bow and arrow…..
I feel like Joe brings elon down to earth a bit. Elons brain is extremely hyperactive I’m sure. He seems to enjoy having a conversations with him and always very relaxed. I think they’ve truly formed a friendship.
Ὁ Αἰλὼν Μόσχος ἀρέσκει τὸν πειραματισμόν.
Ahahah ffs he looks like he-man!!!
Who the fuck is chewing so loud behind the camera when they did the arrow vs telsa bit. I can hear this dudes esophagus
Sorry, thats not a truck.  The 0-60 doesnt matter to me.  I want a long range and a big flatbed on back and complete reliability.   All the other options and tech really doesnt matter.
Not good advertising for that armor company.
I ordered the cyber in 2019 and still didn't get contacted from tesla.
So fun.  Mythbusters did the shoot through a car thing.  They used phone books for armor, and it worked.... but too bulky and heavy to be practical.  I have shot enough bow's to know the kinetic damage Joe's shooting... not bad... not bad at all :)   I love it when you "Robin hood" someone's arrow in the target.  I had an arrow that peeled back like an aluminum banana.   Those carbon arrows can be small enough to fit inside older aluminum arrows.  Seen that once.  No nock on the end of the arrow, and couldn't find the other arrow... till you pulled the first arrow with the other inside it.
Fire the camera man for chewing his gum so loud
Bro is Tony Stark!! For real!!!
Its so weird to see Joes Legs.
I bet i can get in there....🤭
Wow someone's kind of adorable here
Elon seems like a decent dude. I guess even with that kind of money, he's been able to stay normal.
Awesome.. yeah do it right now freedom.. 🍵
Elon and Joe have great chemistry... I need more!
This is a FEVER dREAM E[isode!
That’s insane!
That’s lite my excursion weighs over 10,000 pounds!!!
3:00
Whens the full pod on youtube?
😆😅🤣😂❤❤❤ What a hell!  Some shennanigans
“Honey I shot elon musk’s truck with a bow” lol
and then the cybertruck couldn't get up a slight incline on the test track  lmao
Lol you guys are awesome
How come video isn't working for Spotify podcast episode??
Men being men, even with lots of money xD
The police forces of the world are going to love love love the Cybertruck. 💘
Elon knows when the shit hits the fan when hard times are here many will buy on to the bullet proof truck for additional safety.
Next time u plan a road trip through middle-earth, you'll know which truck to bring
Team rubio🇵🇷💪
For someone who freaks out about someone coughing on the mic. Man you eat like a slob. Had to skip like 15 min of the podcast.
What would of been nice would be to see what that bow and arrow would of done to a regular car.
Hey cutie I can’t with Elon
Joe misses hair.
Joe-Elon marketing scheme on the cybertruck. Well played.
Whoever’s chewing the gum is an asshole
Elon is a national treasure
Rumour has it that Rick O'Shea left the room when Joe started to shoot
why is nobody mentioning the wig, am  I the only person that can see the wig? Is this an emperors news clothes thing?
Automatically first choice for all of the world’s leader travel vehicle.
Try a  bodkin arrow head
Elon looks like a Bond villian
This was filmed at the back of Onnit HQ in south Austin where he does the pod
Sweet, used a bow with half the pulling force of a medieval English longbow, arrows that weigh less than half of arrows designed to pierce armor, and heads design to pierce flesh. What is this supposed to actually prove other than both dudes are cognitively compromised?
you can see the arrowhead come flying right back toward the camera
Elon is hilarious
No safety glasses?
4:04 😂😂😂 hey cutie 🔥🔥🔥
thanks for the gum chewing asmr right into the mic
Still a fan of Elon. Our real life Tony Stark.
❤ Elon 🙏✝️❤️🛐
Anybody else bothered by the camera guy chewing gum into the camera?
Speed is penetration
'Why did you make your truck bullet proof?"  "Trucks are supposed to be tough, right?"  ".....He's not wrong."
This was an awesome episode, the random arrow skit was reckless.
to be clear you dont hide behind a car door to be completely safe but it sure makes the impact a lot less on your body plus the bulletproof vest you should be just fine )) that's not rocket science ......
Joe... the hair... its crazy funny!
Badassss
Miss when he did full episodes
This is the most bro thing
jamie chewing gum while holding the camera !!! i wanted to slap him
This is the great team the two man is very nice see together the conversation 🙌🏻🫠🫠🤤
Great a vehicle made for gangsters and drug dealers and it will probably in some rappers music video soon lol
I wish Elon was the president of the USA
I thought the title was metaphorical.  I didn't think Joe would literally shoot an arrow at the truck. That was a pleasant surprise.
I don’t see that battery pasting pulling that amount of weight
I am a tad bit disappointed Joe doesn't have a trebuchet at home
Joe looking more and more like uncle fester every day
Probably the only monkey Elon loves... inside joke from there first time.
It's not as simple as "bullets go though car doors". Summer of 2004 a sniper round tumbled into my door while we were sitting in a soft skin suv at the gate waiting to meet and escort a contractor on his way from biap. It went through the outer skin, hit a door support and bounced around inside the door never exiting. Lots of factors at play, the distance, the caliber, the tumbling of the round so it hit sideways, the shooters shitty aim
A 9mm wont go through it but he thinks a arrow will lol
Let me finish that drywall for you
Sinister laugh
We needed a slow motion hit, it would've been awesome to see.
3:05 cameraman getting some CRAZY head
Elon has the same villain laugh like Scorpio from The Simpsons .
This is so fucking cool
Why is Joe Rogan dressed like Jimmy saville?
I would like Elon if he didn’t get his start by stealing his partners company and wear a Baphomet outfit last halloween.
G MOMENT
You really can't hide behind a car door anyway since your feet are still visible and car doors have glass windows so shooting a cyber truck with a machine gun is silly since you could just shoot through the glass window and kill everybody in the truck.
Impressive that a billionaire can make Joe her bitch.
Your gum sounds delicious, videographer.
Roger you owe the man a dollar.
Elon is literally a genius, who likes to play like a children. He would make the best type of friend you could have. And i think he is hilarious, and probably could make me better by explaining things to me.
I thought the headline was mostly figurative, this turns out to be real😂
OK...all bullshit aside....these 2 just have FUN talking with each other.  And I LOVE it!!!!
Fucking millionaires ahaha "Bet you cant damage my supper expensive car with a supper expensive weapon" 🤣
I could listen to Joe and Elon talk all day
This is so cool.
Would have loved to see Joe bury the arrow in a tire.
"Hey cutie" 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Who’s eve behind the camera get rid of that GUM!
Every Law Enforcement Agency across the world will purchase this vehicle!
Listened to this episode on a 7 hour drive and now that I see this I only realised Joe's hair 😂  PS: A LOT of ASMR after their pizza arrived holy crap
Wait, Elon... movies tricked me?  Actor's werent portraying whats real?  Seriously, im absolutely thrileld you know the truth and promote it... knowing this now, im actually warming up to your truck... wasnt a fan really, but value comrs with all kimda strings.  Thanks Joe!
He made them that strong for when AI take over we won't be able to shoot these down as easily.
Joe made me smile so much i felt soo honored and happy he chose to wear the Puerto Ricos national Team Rubio Baseball Uniform Joe You NAILED IT. you just need to learn how to say Puñeta 😂❤ even as a halloween costum made me laugh but proud at the same time.
Bada$$ dudes!! Including the wig 😂
Where’s the full poscast
Am I the only one gonna comment about the outrageous burp at the end
I have to wonder if those "sparks" were actual sparks, the arrow itself splintering or if it's Young Jamie playing tricks with editing. What do you all think?
You love to see it.
Elon is a G for smoking anyway
I don't believe these guys really smoke cigars when they're not in public. The way they smoke and handle it, it really looks like someone smoking for the first time... Otherwise, 3,8 millions views for this.... Lame.
Bro 2 things. They have tested.. and arrows generally need to have a harder shaft like steel atleast. (Less flexible) the momentum blows the arrow.  Also the broadhead is bad choice. He needs something less wide and with more girth.  They have tested it with medieval armour.
i thought he was smoking a big kush joint Lol
A heavy grain target arrow would have a better chance
I want this truck
The value just want up
God I love this duo
Mucha tecnología pero no sabe enfocar un puto video😂😂😂😂
Why are there so many chewing and swallowing sounds on this cast... or is it just me?
3:10 chewing gum like pig...... manners man
rich kids dares
Free promotion lol
Joe should wear this wig when he invites Trump on the podcast.
I don’t need my brain microchipped, thanks anyway.
I had to go buy pizza after watching the full episode😁😁🤓
Look at these chumps  🤣
Elon is great at 2 things. Pretending to be a cool and laid back guy while promoting products, and scamming the government to get money
Elon saying "I'll bet you a dollar" cracked me up.
#Thunderf00t more juice for you here 😂😂😂
Sucker
I want a Tesla Truck now. Its above my budget 😢 i need one actually
Wow - there is a proper spark 3:36
Joes wig 😂😅😂
I would only buy a Cybertruck if I had plans to convert it to a gas powered vehicle.
Bet they wished they had this during the Apache Wars
Chewing gum while filming
Joe rogan for president
possibly could with an medieval bow
____________80 pound compound?  Come  one Joe, you should be able to draw a 150 pound bow easy!
These two are building a relationship like the movie Stepbrothers.
and remember the most influential people in the world use Baphomet
You can tell how much of a kid Elon is inside. As soon as Joe talked about shooting an arrow at his truck he was all about it 🤙
Why does everybody discussing cybertruck with absolutely shitty design and garbage building quality and god knows when it'll be released while you can already buy rn the Yangwang U8 with 1100+ hp, 3.2s to 100km, hybrid, with 1000+ km of range on one charge. It can do crabwalk, can literally swim in up to 2m water and has interior all made from nappa leather(literally all interior made from nappa, better than new maybach). And that's a real car that already in production and you can buy it right now with no delay.
Yeah Joe was never going to pierce any type of armour with a broadhead.  You need a completely different type of arrowhead for that.  Joe and Elon should talk to Todd Cutler about making an armour shooting episode with Joe Gibbs. That'd be the weirdest and most interesting crossover ever.
Seeing elon smoking a cigar while holding a glass of whiskey, he just submitted Zuckerberg without even trying.....
The material that truck is made of, I don't think that will just panel beat out? Is that now in need of a $500,000 replacement door???
The lesson to be had here is always keep your strongest bows with you, because you'll never know when Elon will pull up, and let you release arrows at his seemingly bulletproof cybertruck. Next time try explosive tipped arrows.
Eeuu 🤡🤡
I bet joe could back-spin kick a dent into the cyber truck
Joe wygląda jak Barney Rubble z Flinstones 😮
Elon, Joe and Alex Smith.  How could they not overcome evil doers that surround us.
Mints > gum
Elon is Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne. I bet he could create the Iron Man suit and incorporate AI and flight into it.
regular car doors can be bulletproof..... if you stuff phonebooks in them
Can it take a 5.7 or a 5.56
Are the tires bullet proof?
Nice burp to end the show thanks Elon :) lol
Elons soo chill
Youse been to do this again but with either the slow mo guys or the how ridiculous fellas to see it in super slow mo 😂
Joe-Bring up that video of a bear kicking a cybertruck door.
Where did the meme come from? Was that a real person that looked so much like him?
Joe dressed up like a 55 year old skateboarder.
Joe, Energy = mass x velocity squared.  Guns are much higher energy.
Its gonna cost $$$ to repair as well
Hey cutie 😂
Elon Musk is like Lionel Messi, we should appreciate him while he is playing.
Elon bust
Post full podcast assholeee
Great, now they just need to get a bear to shoot an arrow into the window of a Cybertruck.
i absolutely cannot stand elon musk talking. the whole studdering, pausing, looking away. cant stand how he acts like hes autistic to make himself appear smarter. also joe tell your camera man to stop chewing gum in the mic XD
Neural lace...these people
That potential ricochet could have been horrific. Friggin Rogan
So your telling me this car is going to pull me over one day
is it bulletproof
@4:04  “Hey cutie”   😂😂😂 bro took me out with this one
Damn. Why he didn't shoot it with the wig on ajjajajajjja
Hey cutie!😂
Who is the jackass behind the camera chewing his gum like that?!
Illuminati
Ngl I wasn’t a big fan of the Cybertruck from the start but the bulletproof feature makes this thing a street tank!
Is that dude he-man??
awesome demonstration...     just like that..                 deflected ..
I wanna see if the cyber truck can withstand one of Joe’s kicks
elon needs to send one to demolition ranch for... testing
Love these guys!
Millionaires and billionaires and their toys lol
I still can’t believe billionaire Elon musk bet joe only $1 on the bow😭
Is joe Flash Gordon?
"hahah nice but I'm gonna need to see your insurance " - Elon musk
whoever is chewing gum into the camera needs to be put in a federal prison
For a solid four minutes I thought that Elon Musk just had chosen to be incredibly stylish until I realized that it's Halloween.
Woah
"I'll bet you a dollar" is just breathing oxygen for elon
This whole episode seemed like a fever dream.
The evil Elon laugh
Joe Rogan is completely wrong though, crossbows were the most deadliest weapon throughout medieval times against knights in armor. Bolts are incredibly strong because of their penetration force. Bow and arrow might kill a person/animal better but crossbow is an armor piercing round essentially.
I would love to sit down and have a drink and a cigar with the smartest man alive and I don’t even smoke cigars. What a down to earth guy
Elon saying "I'll bet you a dollar" fuckin got me good 🤣🤣🤣
Tyson Fury brings more money in thats why they went for Tyson Fury Joe
Whoever was holding the camera during arrow shoot needs to stop chewing gum like a cow...
Whoever was chewing gum behind the camera…
Imagine Elon Musk saying "hey, cutie" to you as you sit back down in your billion dollar podcasts studio after shooting a broadhead arrow into the side of his prototype, armored cyber truck on a one dollar bet... Joe living a wild life and it's documented on free to access website
There making Joe dress like a chick wtf is going on
Elon start your own podcast
Now let’s try a 300 ultra mag lol
My prediction-once Musk gets the X bank and lending financial services business up and running he will dump Tesla-
So he has on a wig cause this is a joke to him
3:36 - 3:37 cameraman almost takes arrowhead rebound !
So they shall use cyber truck as a cob car, save gas, less maintenance & protect lives & able to run down every bad guy😝
I fucks with Elon, but why he talking shit about mask Mandates when his factory in Fremont ca still have people wearing mask, I live in the valley no one ever really wore mask but in Elon’s factory everyone still has to 🤣 he 🧢
o,   now do it to an old pickup truck in the same room at the same time at the same distance,   and then a new ford ?? or something. city folks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😂😂😂😅
show us the arrow and tip again but in focus haha
Men: Let's build something unbreakable.  Also Men: let's build something thay can break anything.
What's with Joe's hair?
Joe is slacking. Great footage and he has some cow chewing gum while filming it.
Can the cameraman stop eating though?
Next a dress
Apples made me sneeze alot so ifucked myself
The fuck...
Damn, they should’ve tried the window too
What’s up with thing on Joe’s head.  Looks terrible
joe was on coke this episode I think
That spark from the arrow was nuts. Eye protection next time bro hogans. I need more cybertruck
cameraman needs to chew his gum away from the mic next time he gets the chance to film two national legends having fun together.
If an arrow traveling at 300 fps does that There's no chance a 1500 fps bullet isn't killing you immediately
Joe dressed as the “Joe Rogan ain’t slick” meme is hilarious and evidence of Joe’s great sense of humour. Also not having shaub at his new comedy club is proof of his sense of comedy talent.
R the windows bullet proof?
Elon laughs lile Sideshow Bob
They fucking kept it real real.
Proof that Blondes do have more fun
The guy in the wig looks more like Joe Rogan than Joe Rogan.
"Hey, cutie" HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Can’t take joe seriously with that wig lol
I see the rich and famous buying cybertrucks to stroll around in and be safe. I also see the mexican cartels getting plenty of these badboys
Awesome 👌
hahahahahahaha these two CRAZY rich guys talking.... "... ill bet ya a dollar..." hahaha nice  edit: Jamie chewing the hell out of that gum, hahahahaha
ok too the guy eating gum move away from the mic
What’s going to be awesome is rescue services trying to extract a person that’s been in a crash. They might just get to them in time to see rigor mortis wear off for a few hours.
Yep.  There's nothing in a car door but foam and a small speaker.
I love Elon man always creating cool sh*t
i tried deciphering the title, cant believe he actually shot an arrow the truck
drug cartels will gladly be paying markups to get these trucks first
Nothing is made to last anymore, makes me want a Cybertruck.
Joe wants to speak to the manager.. NOW!!!
where do you get windhsheild wipers for that thing? lol
Now he just needs an electric lawnmower. the eLawn
If I never hear or see joe eat pizza on air it will be too soon. Yuck.
Compared to the price of cars that actually have armored panels thats awesome. Talk about having a feature that stands out with competitors, as someone with family and children I think that is an awesome feature to have.
Halloween reigns supreme
Elon looks like such a gangster in his outfit
Love the video but my goodness who ever recorded chewing gum ur an ass for that
What about the windows, are they bullet proof?
Elon is a fucking amazing person!
Where did he parked the truck..? Don't tell me that this is Joe Rogan's garage
I guarantee the next cyber truck will be made out of hemp. Elon’s body language when Joe showed Ford hammering the hemp car was telling, along with Joe’s “it’s surprising you haven’t thought of this” side eye.
None of this seems real
5:17 do it Joe
Whose sucking on their grandmas hard candies while filming bro. I hate it
joe hiding that truck with an arrow leaves the same mark as me parking anywhere in walmart and being  away for 10 min.
Joes looking like a old ass wet wool sock
I LOVE THESE TWO MEN ❤ROGAN❤MUSK❤
This might be the greatest thing ive seen on a screen.
Why is Elon mass producing a dystopian Mad Max apocalypse vehicle? What does he know about what's coming?
Why does Elon alway go on this podcast and do something absolutely absurd
The chemistry with these two legends just  hanging out and talking about interesting and important and goofey  things..    It is such a treat!   Thank you fellas!!
This is nonsense!!!  The arrowhead  used is/looked not solid, so it's not armour pearsing. It's/looked like a 3-sided blade hollow tip for cutting into flesh. Also, it's not clear what is the power of the bow- there could be a huge difference from that. If the bow is /is set on low power like 25-30lb of course, it won't get  anything done. And the shooting at angle?! Come on, it has  to be a stunt !...
In a parallel universe Elon died from an arrow ricochet
I’m really curious is when Elon musk is going to smoke weed on his podcast again   Shit was legendary
I love how the camera man couldn’t get the arrow tip in focus.
Just don’t throw a brick through the window 😂
FKN love Joe. He’s versatile.  He’s hanging with one of our species smartest and most eccentric minds and blending right in.  Wide array of knowledge.  🤘🏻🎵🎸 rock on
Cameraman chewing gum like his life depended on it
I love Elon so much. Such an inspirational figure in our time.
somebody chews with his mouth open when he's chewing bubble gum.  gross.
the fact that elon says "shoot at an angle in case it ricochets" confirms he's an idiot.
Great episode, but why is Joe dressed as prince Adam?
"but the real question i wanted to ask...   can it withstand a bear attack?" - joe rogan
use a field tip.........
It drives me crazy that no one seems to see things for what they actually are.  People look at Elon Musk like he's some cyborg, alien super genius who's on a mission to change the world.  And I suppose some of that might be true.  I look at Elon Musk and see  a little kid  who just became a billionaire and has enough money to do whatever his imagination can come up with and so he's doing it. Dudes out here making flamethrowers, trucks that have no practicality in real life and rockets that go into space.  He's doing what any 8 year old kid would do if he had billions of dollars
“I just dropped like a 150mg edible & I am fucking ZOOTED right now. I feel like I’m on top of the world!  I’m about to build 30 new space cars & get us to Marz”  —Elon Musk
No one cares what 0-60 is on a truck...what can it tow
Tommy gun is a .45 lol 😆 🤣  so he shot the same thing twice
This is like watching two wizards dual with that being said there are to many wizards on my block
That moment was gold ngl with that and Joe's costume making me laugh one of my fav episodes lol
using a metal arrow with a target tip not a broad head would be better test but it was still impressive.
Hahahah we can try it out right now.
Elon is aging really bad. Looks like he aged 10 years since he was last on. Poor guy is working himself to the bone.
Why would u use a broadhead instead of a field tip for that?
Elon is the closest thing to Tony Stark and I guess Rogan would be decent stand in for Hawkeye. He's an archer, a martial artist, and has the ability to banter and roast super villains
Joe speaks like humans and thats why we love him
Best Podcast ever. Like as a whole. The JRE is it.
Im gonna buy me one of those, why not
Joe lookn like a cannabis friendly he-man
My mind is warped.. since when did He-Man play for the Puerto Rican Baseball team?
So sad that Joe is into drag now
Elon's funding Formula E super duties
How to make up for embarrassing yourself by smashing the windshield of your truck. Have Joe rogan shoot it with an arrow
He may not have made it to Mars. He may not have fixed twitter. He may have technially bought his way into paypal and tesla. He may have tried to solve traffic problems with a tunnel.  He may not have solved our dependence on fossil fuels.  He may not actually  have created anything.  But i can finally be safe from 12th century welsh long bow men, thanks Elon!
That’ll buff right out
Like the A-team. Musk has me rolling
Elon buy Star Wars next Disney sux!
Boys will be boys. Glad i'm not born a woman 🤪
That's a cheap ass car
Double triple
I knew you had a hanger, where's that giant land carrier of yours,dam  camel spiders
I thought he was Rick Flair 😝🤣😂
Xx
Vampire hunter d, nice wig joe
These two MEN are the best of humanity
Hey mum
Guns have many,many more times that a arrow
4:04 Me when I see a girl who rejected me multiple times.
Joe now owes Elon 20k to fix the dent 😂😂😂😂
Gezuzz what if it flew back at you Holly heck. You could have popped off Elon Musk. He should have got in the car to be safe
Badass truck !
Man news at it's finest
No rebound safety on that shot. Terrifying.
Playtime with Joe and Elon would be the most viewed show of all time
But can it take a tennis ball to the window yet.
Joe is legendary!
And we care why? Give us a quality car.
Elon is such a bamf for just saying yes to a gorilla shooting his truck with an arrow. (gorilla is absolutely a compliment btw Joey)
Two of my least favorite people !!!
Elon is definitely a redditor and 4channer that is not a billionaire
Have they actually shipped a single one yet or is it just another meme-attracting Musk gimmick?
Getting us ready for the final showdown.
Spinning the block in a cyber truck is craaaazzzzzyyy 😂
Elon looks like a hologram
This some real man/ooga-booga shit, and I love it
No liberals were harmed making this video.
Is Joe's new hairdo part of the Bud Light deal?
whoever recorded the arrow shot literally ruined the entire clip gargling and chewing whatever the fuck they were chewing straight into the microphone. that shit is unbearable for some people, especially when using headphones. makes me want to pull my hair out
joes so lame.
"ill bet you a dollar"
This is really like two friends thinking of an HILARIOUS idea and needing to do it immediately 😂
Where can I watch the full podcast?
Why is Mr. Rogan wearing that wig ? The cigar smoking is rather strange. Gentlemen,  retired to The Drawing Room. For cigars. "I will have The Big Go Away Cigar please ? " "Me also". "Go away!"
thats awesome
And now Elon is making a crossbow!!!
Musk: ITS BULLETPROOF  Cartels: SAY LESS
I always think that having Elon Musk on the show has got to be a good episode, but no…it’s just a lot of one side kissing ass and the other side unparalleled arrogance
The Police will tell you to get behind the engine and not doors for protection ✌️🇺🇸
So you have all the money in the world and this is what you do, you play dress up? Ok I guess   Just saying
Hearing Elon say "ill bet you a dollar" was funny and idk why
WTF? From an interview to shooting a truck with a compound bow
Elon for president and Joe as vice president
Joe, you just lied saying the arrow barely scratched it.  It left a freaking dent in the stainless steel, that's not barely scratching it!
Every rapper in Chicago gonna be riding around in a cyber truck before long 😂
There are a lot of deer that are going to purchase this truck.
Best 6 minutes of my life!
@3:43 look how massive that truck is! Joe looks tiny next to it lol
Haha Joe Rogan on the puertorican team rubio custom 😂 hilarious
Yes bring the 90# WTH steel piercing capabilities !
Elon seems like such a chill dude to hang out with.
twitter has turned to sh*t since elon bought it. u have nothing but miserable mid life crisis having middle age - older mofos hanging out there now. no wonder its dropped in value so much. also, elon is growing his facial hair, i guess to make him look less like a down syndrome patient
why Joe is looking like tired He-man
What was with the ads during the podcast on spotify?? I don't pay for that #%%^
Love this interview hopefully joe has him back again
I bet you a dollar has me stumped lol
Elon is the man.
The damn sound of the cameraman's mouth drove me crazy, FUCK! C'mon joe....
Absolutely disquisting person...Musk🤮👎
Whoa...Rogan is finally out of  the closet. Nice wig. Wudfa ya up for? Ms Trans Queen Austin?! 😂
omfg man genius xD
Elon really is just playing life like it’s a video game.
I cant beleive how dangerous that was.  It could have killed someone😨
This is a truck targeted towards right wing doomsday preppers. No thanks.
Not trying to be a hater or anything but can I just ask why Joe Rogan did not hit the glass or the tire? The test is technically to see if it’s going to be lethal to kill the driver correct or am I losing something?
Is this real or AI? Can't tell what's real or not anymore
Whoever was chewing gum during the shooting of the arrow while filming, needs to close their god damn mouth.  My god.
where can you watch to hole interview
Something about Elon saying “I bet you $1”😂😂😂
If you'd cover the outside with kevlar lvl3 plates, it would even stop 556.
Drive by's gonna be crazy...
Ideal for when I want to take my car from the UK to an uncontacted island in the Indian Ocean. 👌
But why Joe looks so...tired? 😂
No safety glasses….foo!!!
You can feel that Elon really cares about humanity
Elon Muzzk is the biggest joke since Trump. Lying all the time, acting like a spoiled child and like most narcissists he dosent care about other people than himself... Tesla cant even drive itself, is made by low quality materials, hyberloop is a retarded idea and only an idiot could destroy the value of twitter and changing the name of one of the most iconic brands in the world.... Muzzk is not clever, he just got some money from daddy and did some lying like trump... Thats about it...
I want to try pineapple and anchovies pizza.
Did you know that EM father had an affair with EM ex GF and got her pregnant......
What is the point of the cyber trunk? Like this bullet proof thing. WHY?
I think God gave the right person this type of genius. He brain in the wrong hands would end humanity for sure.
Puerto Ricooooo!
Finally something Normal happening in the world...
the best thing will be Whistlin Diesel test videos
scratched it?  That was a HUGE DENT
1000 percent Joe needs to wear wigs for every show
Blonde hair initiation
@1:15 😂😂😂Best moment in Podcast history
The richest man on earth bets a dollar
I can’t take Joe seriously 😂
You already know these 2 are homies.
Love how Elon is holding his glass, a cigar in the other hand and Laughing, so confident you wont penetrate the truck.   P.S. I was eating and smoking, when I heard Elon humbling asking "Hey, can we order some right now?" He is so Humble, sometimes he forget he is Freaking Elon Musk. Also my man you are at Joe Rogan place, if there is someone you want to be hosting you is Joe, there is no one better. Drinking, smoking weed, cigars and a double pinneapple double pinneapple. Laughing your lungs out and having the time of your life. I was sooo looking forward to see Rogan and Elon once again.  Thank you Joe!
It will be excellent for police truck
So many will try this, and Tesla will make millions selling new doors.
My best friends father in law is the dude in the meme. he's a surgeon in Florida Lmaoo
3000 hits, #21 Roberto Clemente. Pirates from Puerto Rico...

Miltary version incoming?
I hope marshon  Lynch gets a little scratch for beast mode
Hearing Elon talk is like hearing a new born Alien through 5 inter dimentional language translators.
Field point woulda did it probably
This is amazing, im always getting shot by arrows when driving! great invention.
The cartel’s already have these trucks ordered lol
This one's for Elon "Boet you need a Bantam" 😂
Elon is a doer not a talker
"It'll buff out"
Definitely one of the weirdest conversations I’ve listened to
Elon Musk saying “I’ll bet you a dollar” is the funniest thing I’ve heard in a while. 😂
Crossbows are smaller but thicker the pounds per square inch will punch like a slug
I already see some upcoming News like: ``Police unable to stop Cybertruck, is it to safe?`` lol
You need speed to penetrate armor. A heavy slow object ain't gonna do it
BEAST MODE VERSION!
Joe hee rogman *budum tss*
Joe Rogan looking like people who wanna be addressed as ma’am in 2023
WOW!!!! I wonder if this was staged???? LMFAO!!!!!
HAHAHA WTH IS THIS JOE LOOKING LIKE A OLD HEMAN.
Elon is gearing up for the apocalypse
Puerto Rico 🇵🇷
Do it again, without the angle, straight forward. Also, the truck is missing a major capability..
Martha Stewart sure does look an awful lot like Joe Rogan. 😮
Is this video from 5 years ago?  you know, when the cyber truck was supposed to be here. I still want one, lol.
Drive it through Detroit. That shows trust in your product 😂
Beast Mode? He is Evangelion fan
Something about Elon Musk saying "I'll bet you a dollar" is so funny to me
God bless if it catches fire like a tesla then you cant get out its a rolling coffin lol .
Why does Elon musk look like a movie supervillain
Bro put everyone at risk 😂
Wow so cool wish I could afford one over here in NewZealand 😮
wtf rich people…
What's amazing is seeing Elon doing the calculations in his head 🤯
But I wonder what happens if you shoot the same arrow into a regular car or a Model S.
Something is coming up soon guys. That's why these are being built. For the ones who have the means. Id rather buy it gasoline though and have it built to my needs
Was Elon also smoking cigar!!? It looked like that
Crumple zone physics has entered chat
They just solved the everyday drive by arrow attacks in chicago and detroit..
Joe dressed in drag still out manning 😂  2 of my fav peeps in this f$cked up world.
there were sparks from that arrow
Musk rushing to check the damage was so funny 😂  I like it when he tries so much to rationalize the already failed “Cyber Truck”! 😂
OMG I love this shit 😂
Joe can’t get someone to finish the dry wall?
Should of kept the wig on
Elon musk betting Joe Rogan a single dollar is hilarious
First I think it's only an Al Video WTFFFF this is amazing hahahaha
Is Joe Depressed?? Who TF risks his own nuts like that? 100 million aint gettin you new nuts dude
god dammit elon ... you got me there .. "trucks are supposed to be tough , is your truck bullet proof?" .. while its one of those things we "dont" need .. it may just be a thing we cant live without in the future .. cellphones didnt "need" 6.7inch displays but here we are ..
Bet a sevr broadhead would have stuck in it
Love the hair. 😂
One thing I have learned is that this is the ugliest vehicle I have ever seen, in my useless opinion
The body language says this was already set up.
I love Elon, you know Elon thinks Joe Rogan is funny lol with the way he speaks to him
But can it stop rifle rounds?
Joe's body is so weird like a gigantic dwarf
Hmmm I thought the 9 had more penetration than a 45. 45 has stopping power. 9 penetration
the cameraman couldnt stop frantically chewing his gum for 10 seconds? ffs
4:55 elons “brrrr” gun sound…I gotta put that on a beat😂 “go full Al Capone brrrrr”
Ask Elon if you can try the glass
Man to be having these serious conversations in these costumes is comedy itself hahah
Joe should wear protective glasses. I have been shooting  all types of bows for 70 yrs & when u blow up a carbon arrow on a rock, stuff can come back at u
How does Joe even DRESS like a short bald beta?
I can't pay attention with that wig
Whats with the blonde? lol
Joe you look like a bad VERY person from England called jimmy savle
Is it just me or does Joe look like an aged He-Man with that wig on lmao
Elon for president and Joe for VP. Let’s go!!!
Glad it didn’t come back on him. Also it worked way better than throwing a brick threw the window. Elon was pretty confident. That was cool af of both of them.
Rothschild  kid didn't create jack... Technology  rolled out slow years ahead...UNTIL.... Corporations have all in place to  PROFIT  over the ppl who succumb to more.more. So many so called projects...poster face
Idk why but, the richest man on earth saying “I’ll bet you a dollar” is hilarious for some reason.
Idk why but, the richest man on earth saying “I’ll bet you a dollar” is hilarious for some reason.
Roberto Clemente Puerto Rico Jersey is La cream de la creme!
Elon the new snake oil sales man
Why He Man is the host and where is joe !?
Is Elon Musk Batman?
Joe owes elon a doller 😂
You can hide behind an engine block but if they are hollow points then it could still make it through.
Whoever the hell is chewing like a cow in the back ground ruined the video for me.
We need more side quests in the podcast 😂
Joe looks like Jimmy Saville
This fun video must have a marketing value of 50-80 million dollars
I still don’t want an EV.
Jamie pull up that video of a bear shooting an arrow through the Tesla truck
Elon casually let's you shoot arrow at his car.   The Cyber Truck looks so gd good and clean
Holy mother of gum chewing, I was inside that persons mouth.
Bruce Wayne interviewed by Clayface about the new Batmobile 🦇🚗
Cmon Joe make longer videos for us !!  my coffe is way longer then thiss   :)
I love watching wealthy people try to act normal. 😂😂😂😂😂
Anyone know what cigars they are smoking?
One of my favorite episodes ever! We got to watch Joe and Elon go on a short field trip to shoot an arrow at the cyber truck, order some pizza, they both were enjoying themselves and even got deep when talking about AI. The Puerto Rico jersey was the icing on the cake for me. Good shit all around
Joe better pay up
Go for the window joe come on
I don’t normally care about mouth noises but Jesus Christ whoever was filming the arrow shot should have their tongue removed. Disgusting.
These guys will never be able to relate to a normal person ever again... And it's not the money, they just don't want to
I loved this episode, this entire episode is Elon just being happy to be living life and laughing, they shoot a car, talk about covid, him buying twitter and how the gov controlled it before, global extinction, colonizing mars, he eats a pineapple anchovy pizza. What a good episode!!
joe aint shooting 90 lbs lol
Elon just casually burps right at the end. Hes my spirit animal
I would have tried a heavier arrow(easton makes a few for big game that weighs well over 700gr) with a field point (smallest sectional density with a stronger tip than a broadhead).  You want more momentum and a stonger tip (i.e. field point, kinda like the arrow heads used to pierce heavy armor back in the day).  It might have stuck in the truck at best)
no because he knows there is a war world coming soon daaa
Weed is good!
Joe’s wearing a Puerto Rico shirt, nice.
Musk should be using the safety of the truck as its primary attribute.  Your family is safer in the cyber truck than any other.  period.
Starting price at presentation were 40k, now it's 100k. Classic Musk schemes.
ok but crumble zone though. this would be a deathtrap
Go, Joe, in, the, Wig. -Brittney Lee Hill Collier, Thursday, November, 2nd, 2023. 7:54 a.m.
Tells him a shotgun can’t penetrate it and insists his bow could do it lol
Smoking weed, drinking whiskey, three hours later en route to meet the British government and its PM to discuss AI 😂
Bro this is the most boys moment I've seen. From the conversation to shooting 😂
It's like two ten year olds with money.
Just seen this clip in our national press, really enjoyed it, however I can’t help but think you could have loaded the dice a little more in your favour. That bow could be tuned to ensure it only had a tight valley where the cams give you the mechanical advantage at exactly full draw. On release that 80lbs of thrust would kicked in immediately. Change your arrow to wood and fit a field pile (tip) rather than the broad head (great for hunting too flimsy for solid metal). Finally borrow a tip from English archers of old and smear the pile with beeswax (increased the likelihood of penetrating armour rather than bouncing off). Doing this may produce the same result, but you never know!
Joe looks like High School He-Man
Need 1 of them trucks
Joe owes Elon at dollar LOL.😂
Every time the camera switched to Joe I couldn't keep it together. His deeply serious face with that wig while talking about his compound bow 😂😂
Joe Rogan wearing a blonde hooker wig is the stuff of nightmares.
.45 is not like a 10mm
"barely scratched it"!?!? 20K later....
Elon's a friend you wish you had as a kid. Hey Elon can we? Yup I got this😂❤
“Hey cutie” “Thank you” 😂 OMG
Funny I always forget how tall Elon is.
There’s something so funny about a billionaire saying “I’ll bet you a dollar” 😂 I love him haha
Hey cutie! Lmao 😂
imagine police cybertrucks
Love this guys ahahahah
Great all the cartels are going to be driving around in cyber trucks lol
Good luck getting cut out of that during an emergency
if joe didnt take the hair off it would work for sure
Whoever was chewing gum in this recording, should be fired. Unless it is Jamie.
That’s actually pretty crazy
When you see Celebrity With Makeup 💄it’s Getting Into The Dark Side 😢
there are going to be some serious tesla technicals running around. move over hilux XD
Never in my wildest dreams would i watch Joe Rogan wear a girl wig while talking to one of the richest men in the world smoking a cigar talking about penetrating a cybertruck with an arrow
My Mom had a wig just like that!
That is the ugliest truck or for that the ugliest vehicle I have EVER seen..........
Too bad the windows still permeable
Dear Joe Rogan, who the fuck shoot an arrow at the body of a car? And for what purpose does that serve?  I'd like to know what's the statistic of people hurt/killed with an arrow in "drive-by" in vehicles? I love listening to JRE podcast and I think Joe Rogan is a very smart individual but sometimes Joe Rogan does things such as this that put his sensical logic in questioning.  Here's how fucked up Joe's sense of logic is --- Elon musk: "this Cybertruck is bullet proof". Joe Rogan: "To prove your point, I'm gonna shoot an arrow at the body of the cybertruck".  Ever heard of "throwing a brick through the window" or "let off a few rounds of 9mm" at the vehicle instead of an arrow? Shooting an arrow at a so-called 'bullet proof' vehicle, -- what kind of fucked up logic sense is that, Joe Rogan? 😒🙄
Buddy chewing the gum behind the camera is 😵😵😵
Okay okay I get it now, I guess I have no choice now whether or not I'm a Elon/Tesla fan-boy.  I have to respect that he puts his money where his mouth is. Plus the way he calmly and casually called Joe out on his claim of being able to stick his arrow in it (that sounds weird).
That arrow was worth so much in advertising
I’m happier for knowing Elon is driving around in a bulletproof, arrow proof truck.
LOVE IT!!!
Why is Joe Rogan dressed like a girl? What is wrong with this world?
No one's gonna talk about the lack of eye pro here? I guess Joe's rating might go up if he's gotta wear an eye patch
Brilliant mate😎👍✌️ 🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺
WhistlinDiesel: “hold my beer”
Imagine being a multi billionaire and offering to bet one buck lol😂
I bet if Joe Rogan signed the dollar he owed Elon (maybe even add a drawing of an arrow), Elon could sell the dollar + the arrow and buy a new Cybertruck with it...
I want one
If you fill your car doors with phone books you can stop bullets.
I can’t take him seriously with that wig on 😂
Must be some good grass.
What's with the wig ??
“Fuck yea let’s do it right now”
Aww now I want friend that’s worth a quarter trillion dollars!! They make it look so fun!!
God bless America
Joe misses hunting bears, so he settles for Tesla
How does Joe look older with a wig?
This podcast Cranked up so many levels after More Scientific Analysis 🧪 🔥🛻
Thank goodness. Not a day goes by that I don’t get shot at on the way to work by a bow and arrow.
I’ll bet you a Dollar 💵 😂  I literally busted out laughing 😆  - E. Musk
This episode is the best ever IMO, Elon was truly inspired and the topics discussed were absolutely beastly and scary, proper Halloween special.
Love the costume
I like Elon he's a cool cat
Why's Joe dressed up as Jimmy Savile?
Can we get MOTU JOE-MAN figure 😂
who manages to chew gum that loud
Bulletproof is cool. That's almostanything proof!!!! Love it. Trade the Hellcat.....no.
The gum chewing camera man needs to be in jail
The gym chewing camera man needs to be in jail
"ill bet you a dollar"  theres something wholesome about millionaires making a bet over a dollar
Why is Joe looking like Jimmy Savile ?? 😂
A field point would have penetrated.
Wait , Joes wearing a Jimmy Saville Wig and Elon is smoking a Jimmy Saville Cigar .... interesting ......
This is peak JRE
Joe is a ballistically challenged person!!! There’s no way metal that stops a 9x19/ 12 gauge is gonna sweat a damn arrow!!!
just don't shoot the windows...lol...   :-)   Hey, the police need these... bulletproof and 0-60 in less than 3... yep... :-)  found you your market :-)
The huge problem with that truck is you couldn't park it on the street and leave it cos so many people will try to smash your window.
Elon doesn't care about humanity. He bought Twitter just to gain political influence when the Republicans win the election again.
Owe him a $1, starts a new company
A carbon fiber arrow wouldn't pierce through a regular car door either. Tesla is done for.
Good to see a lot of people still being positive about Elon. I get it with villainizing the rich but Elon lives in a small box, trys to make improvement to humanity and the planet, and isnt screwing his employees over so he can fund a super yacht idling in a marina unused for most of a year.  I would like to see Tesla Trucks used by police departments to aid the good cops from injury.  Not to mention it might motive more people to become police officers making it harder for corruption.
https://youtu.be/dQrUeui6DOM?si=WwtmNlmGCnM31PEI
dumb. what you should do is make an electric pickup that only costs $20k and will drive 200 miles on a charge. Elon is so out of touch with reality he thinks everyone needs a 7000 pound truck that will go zero to 60 in under 3 seconds. I don't care and I will never buy it. Im not a dumb teenager. I need a practical vehicle. I am 43 and will never purchase a tesla. It would have been cool when I was 17. Too bad 17 year olds don't have any money.
✊😆
7,000lbs is light compared to the new hummer at 10,000
Bro the "slight angle" saved this car
“Hey Cutie” lmao. Elon is such a chilled out guy with Joe. Love listening to these two together.
Imagine for how much Elon could sell this car for: -owned by Musk -shoot at by Rogan
Anyone buying this thing because he needs it, should be arrested immediately.
This may be the best Rogan segment ever.
democrats... they understand so little about guns and ballistics... even a rookie like me knows it's not gonna penetrate if a 9mm didn't. Notice Elon didn't say 556... Just a cheap old M855 would be a far bigger threat then any pistol or shotgun round... arrows pretty unlikely... It's all about the speed... that's what makes rifles effective. Little bullet traveling 3200+ fps.
How do I get the job of testing these vehicles to make sure they're off-road capable I would make sure these things could get through anything, because right now, I feel like they would get stuck in some of the most basic environments, especially with how heavy they are
Rogan is officially a lil' cutie.
So has Joe converted to female
Joes steroid face is showing😂😢
Two legends
“We’ll know we know” 😂 Elon already knew
Why does Joe look like the cartoon Heman 😂😂😂😂
Joe Rogan and Elon Musk are the 2 coolest guys in the world right now and about to save America
Haha, Joe looks like Janet mills with that wig on
link for full episode???
Why is Elon literally the coolest person lol. I love that they said fk it and went to test Joe's bow on it right then and there mid podcast.
Is Joe transitioning.
Armorized vehicles are the ultimate prepper gear. These are going to sell like crazy.
Haha. Typical guy stuff 😆
Elon Musk is not what he seems...
Joe is going to have people carrying bows now on.
Pingtr1p is gonna have alot of fun with this one.   The sinister villain laugh, the cigar and whiskey.. i can see the supercut in my Head already.
1st JRE Interview to Leave The Podcast Room
Elon “we’ve shot shotgun, tommy gun, .45, 9mm” Joe not listening, “duhhh arrow, me strong”
Man the camera guy in the garage needs to learn how to not chew gum when filming.  He sounds like a cow chewing.
Elon just built the perfect vehicle for the Cartels! 🤣🤣☠️
Rick Flair hasn't aged well
what are these measurement units? grains and feet per sand-grain?  Elon is South African, he doesn't know what those things are
This is gold
The chewing noise during the arrow shot was so irritating.
Lol
Love the Puerto Rican shirt Joe
They didn't talk about how much it will cost to repair the dent.
Joe are you dressed as Paddy Pimblett for Halloween!?
How to get full episode??
Joe's omage to this meme whilest  PT fng with Elon & PT being serious as a hearth attack here is classic.
That was sick haha
Joe and Elon should do random shit like that everytime Elon is on. Could turn into a mythbusters style podcast episode
How can we find the full podcast?
Cover vs. concealment
He sounds so similar to grimes
I clicked on this video because that sounded for some reason like a reasonable thing to do. And so I watched.
This is the epitome of boys will be boys
And where could you drive this killing machine? No crumple zones…..
The arrow shattered. That's a whole lot of energy lost that could have gone into the arrowhead, which in itself deformed. A proper test would have been a reinforced arrow shaft with a field point that has a greater hardness than the steel it is up against.
The gum smacking adds a nice touch
Where's Elon Musk? Because this isn't Elon Musk. He actually laughed a shitload of times. Evil laughs but he laughed.
Thank god for elon musk. I sold my car because of the frustration of daily arrow attacks... Curse those jeep cherokees
who is elon?
I've been working in packaging my whole life primarily packaging dog treats. Yeah shits crazy, especially when the company gets a new product. Every product is packaged a different way depending on the company's preferences but when we would get a new product is was left up to the line workers to organize and figure out the line  and how everything would work. You'd think that shit would be worked out by supervisors and shit but its not haha and Jesus Christ those Rachel ray dog treats was a pain in the ass to figure out and one of the most I guess id say pretentious products I had to deal with
Velocity defeats armor. .45 is subsonic and is awful at penetrating armor.
😂😂😂
Joe rogan with hair looks like the worlds strongest karen.
Yo.. if anyone ever asks me what two people you would have dinner with...past or present !! These two all day.. Joe and Elon ! You will end up being one healthy smart mofo !! 😂😂
Why doesn’t anyone ask Elon why we would move closer to the sun. Mars will be destroyed WAY before earth, except for Nukes. Should we not move away before the sun goes through it implosion cycle. Doesn’t matter either way😂we will be all dead before we colonize mars. Just a dude who is practical with 5 degrees and ex ops. I think what Elon is doing is great. But what the living F said let’s move closer to the sun 😂 unless you know some physics about the sun I don’t, please Elon explain.
Joe looks like that psyco from "no country for old men" except blond 😂
Is that Jamie chewing gum? Chew with your mouth closed bruh
Does anyone know who that was at the baseball game?
Elon knew the arrow wouldn't penetrate if the 50-round mags couldn't but still let Joe do it for proof. Always down to experiment new ideas. Greatest of all time.
" I ll bet you a dollar."  "Damn!" Such a boy conversation
Elon does not know what his truck weighs? lol what a fuck
#mayshow sale shoes
that was dangerous... Elon Low key told ya

population crisis and non implementation of Sterilisation program it need to be implemented from peon to member of parliament by hook or crook in all religions in bharat Males who are wasting their precious time from age 21 to 32 years just in preparation of various exams are creating trouble by reproducing and every male must write his surname clearly he belongs to which religion and which caste general category Shudra or Obc This time we all Rajput's and brahmins must unite together call for all Females and males of our community to prevent explosion of population and for resources of india The corruption is at its peak in bharat all the institution is only indulged in corruption from private to govt sectors the gram panchayat to nagar paalika nagar nigam the mayor of Pune jaipur lucknow takes 10 to 20% commission in any project and these lawyers with police and administration and politicians are make loot with unemployment at its peak in bharat All bars and benches are under the one community The Rajputs, Jaats Brahmins and kayastha only real rajputs not those backwards lodhs etc Politicians apart from party making mockery of people they hand in glove with each other across parties and in this bureaucracy, executive and bars and bench are involved  educated unemployment is on its high This is very ugly face of politics in bharat the politicians and their family members are only getting rich and wealthy while common educated people are continuously suffering in bharat I will repeatedly raise the issues what all political persons are doing from gram panchayat to parliament of India only nepotism in every field whether legislature executive or judiciary and so called fourth pillar the media and mediahouses running by businesshouses the politicians with bureaucracy executive and judiciary in high courts and supreme courts are blocked by few people from past 75 years and India is suffering of educated unemployment at its peak we are moving towards stagflation with politicians and businessmen who are politicians and their relatives are continuously getting benefitted  explosion of population must be dealt with heavy hand This time world community have to come forward to deal with excessive population of world and the govt in india is repeating again with bjp rest unemployment will remain bcoz politicians are equally corrupt like people made them across all the political parties common people is just a tool nothing more  The universities &schools must reduce excessive pressure on children and youths by making 50 -50% mcq and theory based examination in all domains from class 11 to ph.d.   this is to be applied at earliest we are witnessing suicides in India at peak Every citizen or NRI of Bharat seeing the comment have to accept that from past 75 years now india witnessing population explosion& everywhere the religious fanatism to make mini Pakistan in pockets is at its peak youth specially males from age bracket of 21 to32 years in Hindus just wasting lives in preparation of various competitive exams but we don't have seats so do some productive work and Medical ,Law field success after course only to those who have father or mother from politics of being Pradhan to mp mla mlcs in Bharat or big renowned lawyers in high courts of various states judges in high and supreme courts or like us bureaucrats journalists for medical field doctors or medical institute owners only they can sustain this generation youths need to understand that they do not reproduce becoz we don't have resources to sustain such a large population only 40crores people can be supported If u a male & earning less than 1 lakhs per month don't reproduce or get married Bharat is overpopulated & suicide whether getting failed in exams or competition is being a common phenomenon no change in govt can deal with that so support only bjp  but corruption is widespread and become integral part in Bharat by politicians and Bureaucracy is equally responsible Those  males who are brilliant not duffers  got prestigious jobs in ssc to upsc maximum to max 25 or 28 years males & females got upsc & various other states civil services witnessing so many of them while duffers are only not got selected Exploitation of students by institutes colleges universities in name of failing must be stopped else prosecution must be initiated but politicians are involved in this
I'm sure Todd's Workshop could make a bodkin tip that would do it.  And if that fails, The Slingshot Channel fellow could definitely make a Cyber Penetrator and show us it's features ;)
Hahahah these two man children i love it
Did you cough up that dollar Joe?
Such kids !
Reading (Audible) the Walter Isaacson book on Musk this last weekend made a big impression.  Dudes as real as you can get in a human with extreme capabilities.  Like many of us his age 'Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy' has played an enormous part in his thinking.
For those of us old enough to know, this guy is Howard Hughes.
Those are the vehicles that we will be using during ww3...
Who tf is eating IN THE MIC.. jesus
That pizza 🍕 part was f-king  funny 😆
Yall are slowly beginning to see why both of these dudes are my heroes!
Now I wanna see what it does to a regular car
Can i drive it to Equador?
I like elons lowball “i bet you a dollar”
I love how when it cuts to the truck, Elons still smoking the cigar lol
I love both of these Men
That fkn truck has the worst lines 😂, body work might be pretty easy tho 😂
Ok, that was insane. That arrow was moving. That's nuts
Lmfao joe looks funny af 😂
Why the wig?   Make money on pod cast with wokes by Rogan just Dana white bowing down to bud light for money?   These people sell their souls and not like Elon.     Crooks
In this episode, Joe essentially asked, "How far are we from having an electric cars that can solely run off of solar?" Elon goes on to say there's not enough surface area currently.  Which lead me to wondered the possibility of adding a layer (weather if it's solely under the car, in specific regions of the car, or literally covering the entire body of the vehicle.) of refractive material and solar panels to allow sunlight to travel within this layer, which will multiply the surface area of the panels.  https://youtu.be/EPUxUn-_qQQ?si=jRN9CWE-egkCI2Tf
That shrapnel could of killed elon lol

Best truck ever
O sht
An armour truck because... America is turning into shit.
how fucking cool is this..... i wish i was rich and could hang out with elon and joe rogan and do shit like this with them.
I approve Elon a goat
feet per second is a scary measurement
Now I want one
Thanks to this episode and them ordering pizza and showing the inside of the warehouse. We know exactly where the new studio is.
This episode is the hardest I’ve ever heard Elon laugh…You can really tell they are legit friends…they are very comfortable around each other.
You need to start adding subtitles for when Elon speaks. He is getting worse and worse.
obviouslu tungsten tip stands more chance than lead
Joe is such a guys guy, he says what we all want to happen XD
Musk is creating civilian tanks for when we need to show these corrupt politicians who's boss. I'm in
Elon wants that government contract to have elites riding in these for protection
Two of the richest men, "I'll bet you a dollar you cant" 😂😂
Joe, drop the whole interview you did with Elon. Come on. Stop being stingy. It’s long overdue.
I called it 😂   https://youtube.com/shorts/bQPtxGmHltk?si=9Tx5FIVJBfq1CvMZ
What type of metal is the cyber truck made of. Why aren’t we using that metal on all of our military vehicles and for bullet proof vests for our police and civilians.
Joe’s the best lol
Can get over wearing these stupid costumes
Polar Opposites meeting at the middle, for some in depth conversation over pizza with double pineapple and double anchovies.
hmmm I would like to see the slingshot channel guy take a crack at it.
Hilarious
Conversations like this are one of the things I love about men. Seriously. Adorably nuts, silly, but manly.
Ja! Rogan disfrazado de su propio meme! Hilarious!
Try a 357…. That would be interesting
I love when Joe and Elon hang out.
Where do you watch the full Rogan-musk 3 podcast?
Add president Trump with Joe and Elon , that would be my current 3 favorite people to hang out with at the same time and just bullshit for hours
I wonder if it will come in a dually configuration for higher towing ratings. Then again, I wonder if towing will be efficient at all with the truck.
Y yo soy boricua!!! 🇵🇷
That’s gotta be one of the coolest things I seen on YouTube in a while. That door, that arrow and the head will worth allot one day
All slow moving pistol rounds and even slower arrow that did have a heavy projectile. Projectiles work two ways, one… big heavy projectile acts like a hammer and breaks through. Two… a very fast moving smaller projectile penetrates due to really the speeds and not so much the mass of the projectile. So most pistol rounds which is all he listed off as even the old school Thompson Submachine gun(Tommy gun)shoots a standard .45 ACP pistol round. A slow moving heavier projectile at usually always subsonic speeds. Most all pistol rounds will be at or below 1,300 FPS(feet per second)which is relatively slow compared to even the slower rifle rounds that will start off at double the speeds of a pistol round(except of course for a few select self defense rounds made or hand loads). I’d like to see what it’ll handle AR/AK wise since they’re the most commonly sold rifles in the US/world that go at double to triple the speeds of a 9mm or .45 ACP. Is impressive though.
Free promotion
Just men being men.
Hey cutie lol 😆😅🤣 Elon is hilarious for a billionaire especially the richest one haha.
Elon and joe have a great conncection, can tell they both like each other a lot.
Paid promotion, did elon drive it truck to the interview...
Cops hide behind car doors because it obscures their body so they dont know where to aim and they'll aim for the smaller area that they most likely will miss. It also can help deflect or slow a bullet down making it less lethal
no safety glasses..... :-(
🇵🇷
Where can I watch the full episode
Is it me or Joe has the Puerto rican jersey on
Tesla motors; all funded by your taxes. The boring company and his space x, all funded by your taxes
Imagine the day all police cruisers are replaced with Cyber trucks
They Peter puffers I see, and what's up with the wig, transgender?
GUNG HO...the movie is called GUNG HO
Ford f250 ? No, my 2014 f150 4 door with a 6.5 bed weights 6800 pounds
Lol at Joe’s Halloween costume
He should have tried to put a second arrow through a window. 😂
I’m so confused. Why did he think he can do that? This sucked ass
I'd love to chill with these two
Nice video thanks for sharing with us
Thank you for sharing your valuable content.your explanation is really easily understood.
Next, I want to see them take Ivermectin together. 😅
I am so glad that the richest man with an in credible amount of influence is this man .A down to earth man with common sence and great values.He's funny and charming too We are very lucky.
Elon and Joe are a good duo bc they both bring something chaotic, badass, funny, informative, and interesting to the table every time.
wow your guys are the best,,,,,,

I love how Joe got all bummed out because he just destroyed a perfectly good broadhead.The funniest part was that Elon bet him $1 the arrow wouldn't penetrate his truck.It's amazing.
Income Intelligentsia's
Thanks for sharing your valuable content.your explanation is really easily understood.
We need more side question like this
Imagine chillin with Elon and then all of a sudden your shooting his car with an arrow 😂
thats titanium
Income Intelligentsiai  Nice
Very nice and informative video. Thanks for sharing this important video.
So Informative video thanks for sharing us
This may be the best Rogan segment ever.  Love Elon's confidence as well. Pretty impressive. The funniest part was that Elon bet him $1 the arrow wouldn't penetrate his truck.
Amazing and very interesting video. Thank you for sharing this video.
Income Intelligentsia's
Income Intelligentsia's Nice
Very innovation video.
Nice video
Great job
"Elon and Joe, two great minds in one place. There is a lot of financial awareness and genius between the two (More on Elons side). A lot of inspiration for our videos came from the financial genius of Elon. Thanks Elon!"

Very good theme.. thanks for sharing
This is such a amazing video. Thanks for sharing this wonderful video.
This must be the most epic podcast on jre. I love how comfortable Elon is with Joe, they really found some special friendship.
Beast mode ! Love how Elon includes every fun thing from childhood in his production.
Very nice👍.

Very nice video..
Income Intelligentsia's
Once the arrow shooting idea was mentioned, there was no way Joe and Elon were going to be able to think about or talk about anything else until it was tested.

Stop the GENOCIDE in Gaza by raising awareness and lobbying those in Government.
Joe, could you guys get better cameras? great content but it feels like 480p....
Jamie, go pick my bow up
I don’t know why everyone hates cyber truck. I’m stoked to be able to finally be able to  draw a vehicle. 👍
I totally want one of these cyber trucks but seriously want a heads up display and a build in jack to help change those tires lulz
Wouldnt this mean that if you crash your cybertruck all the energy go to you and then you die and the car is intact?
WHY OH WHY IS THE CYBER TRUCK SO OBNOXIOUSLY UGLY. IT'S HIDEOUS!!!!!!!!!.  I DON'T THINK THEY WILL SELL.
No engineers fired for miscalculating Joe's bow strength. Yay!  Does this make up for the softball? I'll withhold judgment until they put the truck up next to Michael Knight's car KITT vs machine gun turrets.
Elon is having a blast.
Elon tried to talk Joe Rohan into wagering his dog 😂😭. Elon is like that dickhead of a good friend everyone needs. Best episode in a very long time.
Mr. Rogan. Did you actually ask him when he was going to put them into production and deliver on his word. I like Elon, but when you tell people you’re going to do something and you don’t… I lose respect for you
Elon known's  his audience mostly Rappers and Gang bangers gonna buy this because it comes bullet proof from the factory LOL. Stock gonna sky rocket when the CyberTruck releases.
Coming in 2025, no, 2026, or 2027, Tesla crossbow that is heavier than a regular bow..
Soo was everyone on fear factor initiates into your 3rd eye illuminati club? Bc we know how yall like torchering ppl...can't stand the illuminati trying to act like they are on our side..
My favorite part was elon musk having no concept of kinetic energy but talks about it all the time
the chewing sound hurting my brain
Doesn't he look like Hillary Clinton  😂
Yall should of dressed like tweedle dumb and tweedle dee..friggin posers
Joe, 9mm does 1000 1150 FPS... 45ACP travels slower guys. They're known to stick in windshield glass not passenger glass. Or bounce off. 45ACP is 800 to on the high side 870FPS
Why no one is talking about Elon's alien laugh after calling Joe "Cutie" @4:03
Are armored trucks to be used by the Dems or irs ???
Is that enormous garage on Joes property?
Where'd he get the wig then!!!????
"barely scratched it"? It put a pretty good dent in it!
love my new Tesla,  cant wait to get a second one.
Some say Elon is still holding the untoked cider to this day 💀
The only man in the world who you think to build an arrow-proof commercial truck meets the only man in the world who would think to shoot an arrow at a truck
Speed Penetrates
ellon musk emang keren https://youtu.be/YCbh7DpmLgc?si=kbsSxQA7-L-cYb5S
Obviously Elon holding a cigar like that is only to fit it.
He's not bald anymore
They are comfortable with each other ❤ makes me smile ☺️
Elon has a villian laugh lol
Representing Puerto Rico babyyyyy!!!!
Dude that arrow totally would have penetrated if you left the wig on.
Goddamn… I can’t stand Elon’s face. What a tool.
Joe telling Elon he can penetrate the cyber truck with an arrow is the equivalent of Bert telling Joe that he can beat him in a push-up contest 😂😅
This whole setup the story just watching these guys speak to eachother is so fuckin cool to watch the shit rich people do
Good thing he didn’t try shooting the window, we all know how that would have gone
Why does it sound like the camera guy is sucking on the microphone?
0-60 under 3sec … it is legendary.
"hey cutie" 4:03 😭😭😭
I enjoy these discussions between them. Respectful, non-judgmental, fun. Love it.
The Tesla Truck is so ugly and so sexy that I need one, now.
Blonds have more fun? 🤔
Who cares that only his opinion?
this shit is gayer than dylan mulvaney
Google: Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 2.2 seconds to 60 . That truck is a Beast and better have Some Cyber "Beast Safety" Mode cause that better not end up plowing through a Crowd or Building 😬
Beast mode ! Love how Elon includes every fun thing from childhood in his production.
WTF!   That was awesome!
This is the epitome of "Two F-ing idiots walk into a bar" I love it!!
The hood is about to go crazy  Hellcats are about to disappear 😂
Bruh how can you hate these guys.
I watch the whole uncensored version on Spotify earlier😂
IRL family guy cutaway:
People with these cars are going to constantly be dealing with people throwing things at the trucks!
He bet $1 😂😂😂
My dad shot his truck once … was behind it sighting in on a varmint in the field … forgot the scope was a couple inches higher than the barrel lol
Gung Ho 1986
This is the best marketing Elon could ever ask for
The gum chewing drove me nuts😂😂
Rodent
His chip seems to be largely impervious to substances
Joe must know the way to penetrate armor is with speed, not mass
Yea I caught that part when Elon said you can't hide behind car doors.. then I was thinking I just watched Fast X .. and Dom(aka van diesel) was use a car door for cover even though it was a movie.. so ppl listen to this man☝️ Virtual vs reality
What do the EV haters got to say now?
If the Bible is a myth then why is it unfolding everyday?
joe doesnt look well.
This truck is going to flood the market
I know his bodyguards were tripping balls
This is like a weird fever dream lmao
A broadhead is for tearing flesh. Not the right head for this.
How does something like that pass a crash test?
What an absolute legend. Joe was clearly not too happy his theory didn't pan out but let's face it... We were all routing for Elon because if WE had his money... We would all want to do the same.  Give the people what they want! And Make money at it! Total legend. Love you Elon x
Such a guy thing to do lol
My Tesla $$$!! Can you work on the cheap garbage you sold us? The drive and energy efficiency are fantastic, but anything you touch inside breaks! My dad's Renault 4 is still solid.
I’ve had flu for a month where I actually thought I was dying and JRE videos have helped me through it short enough to match my flu attention span involved enough to take my mind off how much pain I’ve been in (blood coming out of my deep sinuses scared to blow my nose incase my ear drum bursts waking up sobbing I was in such stabbing face pan I have no doctor so I had to try turmeric I was broke so I couldn’t buy even aspirin so cold towel and lemon juice jn water is the most I could do and Joes videos have kept me going through It when you can’t go to a&E with a sinus infection but you’re in so much pan you want to hit yourself in the face with a hammer incase it counteracts the pain at 3am a month of telling myself to keep breaking and to just try to rest and drink fluids I had no food in the house just pancakes and no money no family no doctor and I came here and I’m hooked he’s just genuine I wish Joe was my dad or my uncle somene I coudl call for advice his take is spot on in everything
Chilling with the world's richest man and shooting his car with a bow. Wow
Billionaire: "I'll bet you a dollar." Hundred-millionaire: "Damn." 😞
Whew, Joe Rogan is definitely looking his age. And Elon looks like if he gets another hair transplant his hair is just going to up and leave him like all his baby mamas & kids.
God damn it, what the fuck is that sound?!? Does the camera man have pop rocks in his mouth? Fuckin stop it.
Would the windows have broken though?
Team Rubio Halloween custome!! Nice!!!
Don’t you talk about the A Team! That’s sacred sh*t! Lol
You can be yourself when you don't have an authoritarian employer.
3:15 First thing.  I don't think the spectators are standing far enough back. Hey Jamie, pull up the clip where we shot a bear into the Cyber Truck.
Why did you make it bulletproof Elon? My view: 1. Zombie apocalypse is here.  2. Fear of assault. 3. Watched T2 five times.  4. Defense against militarized AmeriNazi Police.  5. The end of Amecican civilization is coming.  6. Just wanted the most badass truck possible.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Elons has a villain laugh 😂😂😂😂
Elon Musk really do look like Tony Stark
This is the way men hangout and do fun shit.. 100% if a grenade setting next to it nothing happens 💪
Joe take the wig off…. Get molester vibes
Is that a Paddy Pimblett Wig?
Barely scratched not even close to knocking the ugly off of it lol.
All the brothas in the hood guna be coppin ddzz trucks
But can it survive fingerprints?
Awesome!
Heard a good one about this today. The Great Kahn is foiled by Elon's wizardry.     (You know, because the bow was the AR-15 of the Golden Horde.)
Them breaking normal for the arrow shot was great, but the pineapple anchovy pizza purchase was most fun.
Elon Musk is looking older and wiser by the day
I need this truck.  / "Dear Santa and Elon... (Marylin Monroe style)
The bio didn’t disappoint
The confidence in his product is more potent than any advertisement could be. 👌
I was disappointed by the video and audio quality of this video. It was like you guys were not ready to shoot an arrow at a truck.
looks like he's wearing an old Hugh Hefner coat lol
What’s with the hair though
A dollar richer !
My dream is 1000 friends ❤
Anyone know what lb draw the bow was?
"I'll bet you a dollar" I fuckin love that guy😂😂😂
Lucky joe didn’t get hit or anyone else l😅
LOL he used a broadhead... broadheads are about the worst possible arrowhead for piercing armor.
It’ll buff out
how do you talk 3 hours and talk about nothing? most boring and uneducated podcast ever, disappointed
Shout out to whoever was chewing gum w their mouth open while taking this video. Thank you for that
I love Elons “billionaire laugh” Only insanely wealthy people laugh like that.. and haunted dolls
why are you still having this guy on the show? I used to be a fan of him. But now he is supporting far right extremists parties (per definition of German court ruling) in Gemany (where I live) and has been calling for us to let people drown in the mediteranean. (which we're already doing A LOT, among other illegal things there)  UHH YEAH MY CAR IS SHOTGUN AND ARROW AND THOMMY GUN PROOF. wtf guys, so cringe
What’s about the window
So awesome.  Love to see Joe and Elon Musk hanging out
Powerful CRE... Joe, I hope it's a wig your wearing...

Well, we know what vehicles the ram raiders are going to be stealing … smash through a shop front (with ease) steal all the jewellery.. then outrun the police … and worst case … take out police cars and stops small arms fire… if they make that thing with run flats or solid tyre systems … look out!
Why are broads (🤷‍♀️) called broads, and broad heads called broad heads? Broadcast that.
The meme of Joe being a mighty Khan is never so true  as when he has people like Elon on his show
Hey Cutie 😂😂😂😂4:02
Elon doing the physics calculations in his head almost instantly in response to joe's information about the weight of the arrow and the speed is funny asf
Elon = Batman
Elon looks happy.
I love this two together. ❤
Give Elon his dollar Joe! 😂
Please move back to Cali
But.. broad heads are thin razors.. for 1300 years there have been arrows that could puncture plate armor
Why do some people smack so much
I love this duo so much
damn the point of the arrow turned all blurry!
Musk isn't and probably never will receive the credit and appreciation for his efforts to return the world to the center line. He'll never see this but - thank you, Mr. Musk.  Think he's a bit surprised by how naive joe is regarding how dark the beliefs and intentions are of the hard left.
Wait till the Cartels get a hold of this truck.
Can the camera dude please chew gum with their goddamn mouth closed. Damn son.
Ugliest truck ever fuck’n made 😂
thats a reckless thing with "ricohette/scarpnell " alltough it was a bow these parts can bounce.
Love you Joeeee!!!❤❤❤
He gets the metal from the planet he's from.
Cartel guys got this truck on pre-order
Leave it to Elon Musk to make a 21st century car that can totally prevent a 18th century carjacking.
Cool spark when it hit
I mean the metal can be bulletproof but are the windows and the driver window bulletproof too?
Guys, can you encourage me?
Hey cutie 😂😂😂
I see a lot of safety and hazard issues with the cyber truck like what if you drown or get in accident need to break window to get someone out their needs to be an emergency hatch or something I feel like from inside or something
Wow that truck is impressive guys !!💯💪
The smacking of the lips.. I can’t take it
Clearly Elon need protection, thats why he made that car
If a 90 ft lb energy bow sent an arrow through that door it'd be pretty crazy. That will do it on most regular cars these days, but for something built to be rugged I'd hope it not come near penetration! 8D
Does cyber truck have a 4 wheel drive option?
Is Joe Rogan trying to look like Jimmy Saville for Halloween?
Design budget   1 x pencil  1 x ruler  And Elon
I bet firefighters will ove it when they have to extract someone from a mangled cybertruck
These 2 guys for President n VP of America would be off the hook🤘
That CT values just doubled...
I wish the cyber truck could get an european homologation. But stainless steel metal on 4 wheels bigger than a Volkswagen beetle lol
7000 pounds is heavy but a standard RV has around 6000 to 7000 pounds too and it's easy to drive and handle if you're not driving like douche
Jamie pull up that video of that Podcaster shooting arrows at the cyber truck
If he'd have shot my nissan it would go right through and come out of the other side!
4:03 - “Hey cutie, Gheheahahahahaaa”
😂
When did Joe grow his hair back??
The sparks were a surprise.....
Is the cameraman chewing the world's largest piece of gum??? Wtf, it's all you can hear during the archery portion.
Now, when native Americans attack your badass cyber truck you will be safe! Seriously though, an arrow? Of all things? You know we have bullets right?
I thought this was a Pingtrip edit at first haha
Mark my words: this is really going to start some craziness on real Cybertruck owner’s vehicles. People are going to test their weapons on it just to see if it’s true, leaving a ton of dents and markings on it.
Anyone remember Mad Max? Cant wait to get my Mad Elon truck.
i remember when elon was bald then he became rich and had hair again and now that joe is rich too he has his hair back... lucky guys
Field point would have been a much better test
So when do we get the video of the doors getting machine gunned ? Or is that, as I suspect, total bs?
This entire podcast needs to be a paulytoon!
Bro CHEWING gum behind the camera
Boys and our toys 🤣
Elon is so cool
I'm here for the syrup 😂
Damn. What an honor
I’m just glad the arrowhead didn’t hit anyone. Did y’all see how it flew 😳
Paddy the Joe Pimblett
And is the cybertruck design to fold up when it hits something?  Safe vehicles do that.
Hell yeah Gangsta!
Soooo how is this thing going to perform in a crash test if it's made of steel that thick? Does it even have crumple zones?
I'm actually impressed at how bad his producers are at filming things off the tripods
Who tf is chewing gum into the mic tho fr
Wow that’s awesome ❤😂
The perfect "car" for Americans
Why is Rogan dressed as Peado Jimmy Saville?
Joe is a brilliant idiot. He derailed this conversation horribly, fighting fighting fighting. You are sitting with Elon Musk. Talk about what matters. The stupid hour was such a waste.
I like how the cybertruck saves our planet!
Simply brilliant 🤣
Joe maybe slightly off kilter after interviewing the 2 movie guys with the hate-able voices. Can’t believe he made it 2 hours with them.
Elon to Joe: "I bet you a dollar"  Gotta fucking love it 😂
Great, now Joe does stupid pet tricks,  holding up a big sign that says ‘I’m bored with asking questions and controversy’.    Really need better from whoever has the most views on the internet for interviews/news.
a truck that literally has been promised for 6 years and other than prototypes- DOES NOT EXIST
Bruh you do not want to crash on the cybertruck. That shit will be hitting like a concrete wall.
Brilliant cool clip..👊💪
This is the most American shit  youll ever see.   AMERICA         FUCK YEAH!!
Christ! , I know it's Halloween and all that stuff, but Joe dressing up as sexual predator Jimmy Saville!!!!   Not cool, dude!!!!
Jo showing off his born gender ? Shaming Ritual !
one of these people is insane and a fraudster who lies about made up things constantly. the other wears a blonde womens wig.
Did they forget that they are in America? Americans does not do bows, test it with Gun and see how it holds up, preferably an AK.
He was inspired by the A team, love it.
I need one. Will it swim ? He said it once ?
Okay this was cool but to say it barely scratched it is a bit of an overstatement. You can clearly see the damage it created into the side door.
??
The whole reason a car is so destructible is bc its to make you not die in an accident. The truck being that solid isnt a plus.
I love how Joe can't even conceive how to move the hair out of his eyes because its been THAT long since he's touched his own hair lmfao
“Hey cutie” evil laugh
Should have waited for solid state batteries to be perfected..
A-TEAM truck was bulletproof!
Im not here for the pineapple pizza  Anchovies i can live with.. pineapple.. not on pizza…
The richest man in the world betting a dollar is the funniest thing to me
I need to know if Joe actually gave him that dollar!
01.11.2023 01:13am My Nam Is 30.8.82 Ronald Reagan I am 40 years Old I Am  Bangladeshi
His wig reminds me of the Japanese Moneky Meme
Good lord who is chewing gum during the shot demo?
They seem like cool guys to hang out with.
wow
That sound makes me crazy- Elon’s wet mouth sounds like stirring macaroni and cheese.
A TEAM what a show ... truly a classic .
Great commercial. A bit long and wordy but so cool though what with the cigar smoking and booze guzzling. It's a f****ING men's car for a f***ING men's world!😂
Tesla is not a Ferrari Tesla is electricity  ⚡️⚡️⚡️
Homebody did that without any safety shield ... ballsy AF!  Joe owes Elon a buck.
why is elon dressed like one of the weasleys
Billionaire lets multi millionaire shoot a compound bow at his car
This episode was fucking amazing
Joe is possibly the only interviewer that can bring popular or people like elon to meet him personaly
Don't shoot the window.  We know what happens to those
joe needs therapy
What on earth are you wearing Joe?  Please do not dress this way when i ask you to be my sparring partner in heaven. 😂  Its too much, someone in the comments said you look like "He-Man"
I love watching joe with elon he is so casual with him its immpresive. He makes it look easy  Keep it up joe from england
That was dangerous as F!
Elon wasn't confident about that arrow hitting his truck. He tried to convince Joe to shoot it an angle to lessen the impact. And after the arrow did nothing to the truck, Elon had this laugh as if he was impressed that it did nothing.
Insane, ricochet billionaires.
Who's want to part 2 🖕🖕🖕🖕
OMG.. I really want to see Elon fighting Zuckerberg after watching this episode!! 😂😍🤼⚔️
Elon and Joe are 2 of the coolest people on the Planet!
Try the glass!!
Now he just needs to make it diesel/electric hybrid and it will be cool.
I LOVE IT!!!!!!!
What alot people don't know is that it doesn't take much to stop a pistol caliber round...but a steel tip rifle round is a diff story
Police and get away drivers: nodding slowly.
THATS INSANE
Joe: You want to run through the heart attack wing of a hospital blowing air horns? Elon: Ok.
I watched the first interview Rogan did with Musk, it was honestly kind of painful.  Rogan even talks about it, said it was one his most challenging interviews.  3 or 4 interviews later, they're just 2 homies hanging out shooting arrows into each others trucks.  I can't hang out with someone who doesn't like these guys.
Eli like musk but I don’t think EVs are going anywhere in the long run
Elon strutting stuff
3:32 just wow 😮
Hilarious!
You need a bodkin point to pierce armor...
this is crazy so real almost fooled me😱😱😱
I so fuckin want a cybertruck
having a cybertruck before anybody else. BOSS MODE. Shooting a arrow at a cybertruck before its sold. BEASTMODE
💯🧑🏼After tweeted about WG happening on the White Boers in South Africa, Elon Musk just tweeting about the Latin invasion army attacking America's southern border in X🤍👍🏻👏🏻💪🏻👌🏻✨🔥♥️
Camera chewing gum should be fired

WTF with the wig???? Anyone know???
hy cutie: 😈😈😈😈
Wig Out...
Is this the first time anythings been filmed outside of the studio for an ep????
I know this is about the arrow and all, but that truck is hideous!
Holy shit Jaime stop smacking that gum.
This shit is so dangerous 😂. U can legit see a small piece fly towards the camera
Is your truck bullet proof 💀
Joe looks like a smaller version of Rick Flair
Bullet proof or not, The Cybertruck is still the ugliest truck ever made!  Not too mention, Whats the cost to fixing that small dent...In stainless steel!
Hey Joe! You look like my high school gym teacher!
6000 lb is tax deductible
Can’t tell if the car is huge or joe just Really small
Paddy Pimblett day?
Joe Rogan wearing I meme of himself is genius.
TRULY INCREDIBLE!!!! ELON MUSK FOR PRESIDENT!!!!
Why is Joe wearing a blonde wig?
I've been near enough ricochets that I would no nowhere hear LOS with that experiment.
you can tell by Elon's warning that Joe died doing this in another timeline, nice of Elon to keep him alive in this one.
And of course, no mention of the crimes Isreal is committing.
When i saw Joe with the wig i lost my shit😅
Epic af
will a bullet work
Bodkin arrows would be the choice over broadhead
A broadhead is the worst type of arrowhead to use on a non-flesh target.  Even a practice arrow would have a hard tip that is designed to be used over and over again that would do better against armor.   Just look up medieval arrowheads designed for taking out armored knights. They have slim arrowheads.

Joe looks soo fucking hilarious.
The last half hour of this podcast is like someone edited a joke version making it seem very awkward
I’m trying to figure out how in the hell Musk has time to play Diablo IV???
Electric engines.... yes ,Joe was on grass.
i love elons laugh haha
Millionaire and a billionaire betting a dollar is giving me Trading Places memories lol
Shut all you ram/Ford/Chevy etc people up with your plastic cars talking about yea dude lol losers
Whoever filmed the arrow shooting....stop chewing gum into the camera OMFG
4:05 elon was hitting on joe lmfao
Ok..you sold me. I want a Cyber Truck now.
Why Joe’s outfit?
You should have at least given it a fighting chance and used a bodkin style arrow, or even just a well built field point. A flimsy modern broadhead didn’t stand a chance.
2 idiots!!!
We're watching Elon become a super villain
Musk looking like Willy Tonka and the Truck Factory
But why dress as a woman? He could’ve been a Viking or a bean
Gotta say Elon is pretty cool and relaxed while sipping whiskey and smoking a cigar
damn wtf lmao
ahaha lel , joe ain't slick meme
As a  truck owner...     I'd like to see Elon make electric components, door handles, window motors, or complete door insert panels for Chevy & Ford, they just can't make plastic parts that last ,or metal that doesn't rust, before the motor dies !                                 &          I'm not buying any new truck !     our "throw away" society only benefits corporate capitalism & government !       (at excessive expense to us)
Trucks are made out of the material to compact in a car accident. They used to be a stronger metal.  Elon’s truck wouldn’t pass the crash test…
A production vehicle thats bullet proof , released in a country where mass shootings occur all the time.  I dont know if this is a good thing, or a really bad thing
What happened to Mosks Electric trucks that were supposed to take over the Trucking Industry 10 years ago at a fraction of the price ... A No Brainer i think He called The Plan ? Probably a traffic jam right now in Vegas Tesla Tunnel .... Round about 2025 is supposed to be a peak for possible Solar  Flares that would destroy the batteries of all Elecric Cars on the Sunny Side of the World .Worlswide Economic Colpase if the Electric Truck Fantasy had actually worked .....................
❤❤ ..
Joe hears we’ve shot guns at it, and goes “let me try to shoot my bow at it”. Have you seen avatar my man??
So you’re wasting a ton of energy hauling around heavy bulletproof panels in case you run into Joe Rogan with a bow or Elon Musk with a nine
And with the solid body panels when that truck runs into something all the accident is going to be transferred to the passenger because it’s not going to crumple at all what a piece of shit that truck is
Joe's costume so clever😅😅😂😂
I luv how people didn't get the Rohan reference...man there's some dummies out there.
ELONS cyber junk is bullet proof... Very doubtful YOUR cyber junk will be, and good luck with routine maintenance or any type of body work.
Anytime a friend needs a plug, Joe to the rescue
Whenever these two guys get together they turn into two 12 year old best friends looking for crazy adventures to get into.
Below 2 seconds my ass. This man cannot stop lying he’s the only one who needs that thing bulletproof
Elon Mosk ... Supporter of russias claim to Ukraine ... Sabbotaged drone attack on Sevastapol Harbour  ... Supporter of Iran as well ? ... Wants to do Business Simply in Diktator States  without Human Rights Red tape or regard to Our Planet (he thinks his Followers going to the -50 Wasteland Desert of Mars Fantasy  10 years ago alrerady) . Can buy Dirty Earth Metals from China cheap  for his Batteries with all the benefits of Slave labour and Total Disregard for the Enviroment ... Still faster to walk around Vegas by Foot then using his cars stuck in a Tunnel ...
Nice to see Iron-Man and Hawkeye chilling.
Instead of trying to shoot an arrow through Elon's new Electric truck, Joe should be explaining how much the truck costs, the components used in making the battery, where they are mined, by whom, how much electricity is required to charge the thing, where that electricity comes from, how long the battery will last, how much the battery costs to replace, where the old battery goes when it's dead, how much this helps China's economy, and the fact that America's electric grid cannot support all those EV's that Biden is forcing us to buy. It's a farce!
Yea cool shit joe rogan, sell us all this ELECTRIC vehicle so it can be hacked and blah blah blah - stop being part of the Jo problem joeproblem- joe problem -
Cameraman chewing that gum like he trying to squeeze the last ounce of sugar out of that thing LOL
Hide behind the car wheals
😂😂😂 I really appreciate that these two men don’t take themselves too seriously
God damn, I wish I had money for one of those things. It looks like ED-209 from Robocop.
But the trucks won’t run in the cold, and they won’t nearly pull the same weight as a traditional diesel truck, especially in the cold. So, if you want a super expensive summer electric truck, you can’t go wrong.
I thought Elon was toking a  blunt again 😂 the intro got me
Man this is amazing!
I love America.
Everyone’s gonna know it’s Elon’s cybertruck now 😂
Love Joe's jersey.
Joe looks like a beautiful woman. I had no idea he’s a transformer or whatever.
Do a molotov cocktail next!
Are they going to lie about the 0-60 time on that like they do with the plaid cars?   Where just for that they LITERALLY put glue on the track to increase traction and also ignore the first foot of travel … which means the car is no longer stopped when the timer starts … which means it isn’t a time that begins at 0 miles per hour … which would be like doing a 0-50 time and presenting it as your 0-60.   And, I think if they did it for ALL their vehicles and were consistent that would be something.   But, no, they just do it for a couple versions of a couple models to give those specific versions an advantage.   Am advantage that zero other car makers are using.
Joe you probably still owe Elon that dollar
Joe has the shortest torso of any human alive.
What about iihs crash test with cybertrack?  I wander to watch that 😂😂😂
first of all, broadhead arrow heads are not used to penetrate armor... second, you cant call it bulletproof if it stops arrows, use real gun ffs...
E=mv^2  the velocity of the arrow matters MUCH more than the mass. A twice has heavy arrow gives you twice the energy. A twice as fast arrow gives you 4 times the energy.
The only cyber truck demo that I remember is it not being able to get up a curb. lol https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2giv88irtU
Elon is getting better at speaking. He conquered his autism
The gm smacking is atrocious
Somehow Musk likes and seem formidable at calling BS on certain things and then he makes it right. :D I have to respect that. TY.
joe looks good with blonde hair
NOW we're talking about a truck I'd buy. Not a fan of electric, but bulletproof is nice
Joe reminding me of Anton from no country for old men.. except Blonde 😂
This looks like one of those deep fake memes
Heck yea
Joe out here lookin' like Heman's uncle 😂
A car that fast, that heavy should be called a weapon
Why is Rogan wearing that ridiculous wig?
I think common sense is wearing eye protection, especialy shooting something with that much force so closely. Let's not even talk about the camera work here. What's the guy using....an Iphone? Because the inability to focus...
Joes the only person who's managed to get elon to drink whisky, smoke weed and a cigar, he's like that bad influence you need to avoid but can't get rid of 😂
Imagine chillin with Elon and then all of a sudden your shooting his car with an arrow 😂
After Joe at carbs this the interview got repetitive.
Elon's sinister laugh after the arrow was defeated is pure gold! haha
😲
How calm this man can be wearing what he’s wearing is hilarious
I spent a good minute and a half just laughing at the thumbnail.
You know you made it when you let your interviewer blast an arrow to your new car that hasn’t even been released to the public yet 🤣
What’s the full interview neme
A billionare says he'd bet a millionaire a dollar. Sounds like a cheesy joke.
So is Joe supposed to be Flash Gordon?
Drug Cartels and World Dictators are calling Elon Now !
Best Tesla commercial
Musk only digs blondes so I guess that's what Joe's costume is.
How much do you think it’ll cost to buffer out that dent?
It could be good to be friends with these people :D
Millions of dollars in that room and no eye protection??
Why do Americans age so hard. Joe look 70.
lets now try the Rambo explosive arrows
Tried listening, they played 8 commercials in 30 minutes - and I have premium Spotify. Turned it of at nr 9.
Joe is secretly training Elon to fight Mark Zuckerberg 😆
This clip is such a fever dream 😆
I love that my two favorite humans are debating on caliber velocity and penetrating power between arrows bolts 9mm 45acp and 12gauge
the tip off the arrow breaks off and  flies very close near Elon
I’m ashamed of how long it took me to realise Joe had a He-Man wig on 🤦🏼‍♂️
Nice hair Joe 😂😂😂😂 sexy blond
Elon is having a good time around Joe, such positive vibes Joe emits…
Why does Joe look like Jimmy Savile?
video sounds like a cat licking itself
These two, got to say the enjoyment i get out of watching...just watching these two talk. Id love to have just a sit down in a bar and join in with these two. Amazing
Boys Bathroom be like:
hilarious !
cyber trucks about to become the new drive by go to vehicle in the hood
Anothy Rogan????
I could watch these two all day,
Who tf was chewing gum right into the microphone during the bow skit??
Is that Jo Rohan!!!!
So Elon Musk can make a bulletproof truck, but our military send solders to war in soft skin hummers. Interesting 🤨
So he “TRIED” cause it looks like he “DID”
Richest man: I’ll bet you a dollar… 😂
Best unintentional commercial ever…or was it really unintentional ?
the cybertruck looks so stupid
I like when rogan starts tryin to give elon a physics lesson.
I could shoot a arrow into that very easily with my 200 pound draw Osage, orange long bow , a carbon 500 grain arrow maybe even a 800 grain arrow with a chisel tipped broad head (CHISEL) tipped is the key , that’s because it breaks bone then cuts through , it would definitely deformed the tip but I could get the arrow through the truck or into the door at 20 yards easy , probably would crack or crush the arrow to but I could get it through .
that was amazing!
Can't wait till I get my Cybertruck. It's being delivered this month. Let's go!
Joe/Elon 2024
what is Joe’s costume supposed to be?
Camera man chewing the hell out of some gum!
Ok, that was amazing!
What a great pair of Americans. Talking about normal life.
Just love it alein musk😊😊😊
Bruh why is the cameraman chewing gum so loud - it's disgusting
2.7 million views in 21 hours. Impressive.
Part of me wonders if this was created so it’s designed primarily for military development regarding applications/purposes and being “bulletproof”.
I can tell this is gonna be a good interview. He called the truck having beast mode
Elon's laughter is so villainous, never gets old
This is such a weird marketing campaign. We all saw the glass shatter when they threw the ball at it years ago.  Cybertruck demand must be pretty low
Downtown San Francisco is not a zombie apocalypse, it's a capitalist dystopia, but I see what you did there, trying to dehumanize the homeless.   Also, you seem to misunderstand what a death cult is. Death cults promise you something after death, if you've behaved as required by the cult leader.
Dammm.. I need one of these Tesla Trucks when I'm driving in the hood!
Elon the next big archery manufacturing company. Hey Joe pay up 😂
These two are a vibe bro
I can't take that conspiracy theorist lunatic Joe seriously.
He knows… its going to be a highly valued and marketed vehicle come WW3 and Armageddon. Hes not just designing bulletproof trucks for the hell of it. They know the coming events we dont
The whole time I was thinking "WEAR YOUR eye-PRO!" Then sure enough pieces went flying unpredictably and fast.
No eye protection or focus was seen in this clip.
This is fascinating. And very interesting
Did the disgusting pig handling the camera not realize his beak would also be recorded? Check yourself.
“Arrow proof” Trucks- This is why liberals fear Elons conservative spear of destiny.
On the full length ep around 37 minutes when the sardine convo starts, you can tell these boys are f**kin baked 😆
Once the arrow shooting idea was mentioned, there was no way Joe and Elon were going to be able to think about or talk about anything else until it was tested.
I definitely would have had some safety goggles on for that.  Wow.
One for the internet ages!
Detox and Cybertruck will drop simultaneously.
If you have *Misophonia* skip this episode!
Looking good Joe with those locks 😂
Elon is getting shitfaced on Rogan TV!  🤣😂
Joe looks all pretty and dolled IP on this one. Lol.hilarious
Good luck pedestrians
What's up with the wig lol
i need that 🇵🇷 jersey!
Only Joe Rogan…
No country for old men?
Why didn’t he keep the wig on!
Elon: I bet you it won’t  Rogan: Hold my hair
I bet the women watching this are like:  “freaking men; they never grow up”.
Broooo i saw the cyber truck driving on i80 in sacramento a few weeks back. I tripped out. Im still extremely curious as to who the driver was.
Sounds like the cameraman that's recording Joe as he shoots the truck is aggressively chewing gum I've never wanted to come through and smack someone so bad of my life
Lol, I can see the mexican cartel rollin in their stock bulletproof cyber truck.
3:35 Bro thats some form!!  16th weapon from my Weapons Theory
Elon likes to hear himself talk
they are such interesting people man, its awesome when curious and great people are able to enjoy what they get from bringing value to the world
Think about this in the movie fast and the furious when they shot the arrows into the cars to shut them down electrically All it has to do is pierce the metal and then it attaches and then all the metal in that cyber truck can be zapped by police or whoever wants to zap your ass.. get ready for the zapping wars. The police will be able to shut your electric car down in a heartbeat but they probably should be able to do that with your gas cars too because they're mostly All electronic anyway All I got to do is zap you folks it's coming. What am I talking about it's already here lol. We are in for some insane times. Technology's about to get used against us I can feel it I can feel it in my blood that false flags are about to start flying everywhere. It's because they don't want Donald Trump to get into power and they're going to do whatever they have to do. They don't use the virus now I think they're going to try and use aliens let's get ready folks it's going to be on
What incredible resilience.
Its not a mystery...stainless steel is super dense and tough to penetrate or damage
Im sold.. That was sick.
If the arrow would get past the door, we would never have seen this video :)
Elons right here, right now attitude is the way.
bro that's a damn tank
What about the windows ?
What a way to raise the value of your product, take a challenge anytime anywhere to backup your claims! Walk the walk!!
“But it does in the cyber truck”
Cyber Crematorium / Cyber Coffin  If that battery goes then you are not getting out of it :)
best episode ive seen this was gold 🤟
Hey Cutie😘🤣
Elon is literally a Bond villain in real life
Haha he dressed up as the meme for Halloween, tremendous
Admire Elon Musk, but boy the Cyber Truck is ugly. Not even in the Crocs-ugly way where Crocs seemed to be designed to be ugly, but more so a product that was meant to be designed nicely, but turned out ugly kind of ugly.
Why the fuck would he think an arrow would do something to that truck when guns wouldn't?
It’s like a futuristic armoured vehicle.
What the heck is he wearing!!!??
Did they test anything more than 45/9mm and find the limits yet?
Joe Rogan ain’t slick.
If you would of had the black wig on you would of pulled off Anton Chigurh from no country for old men 😂
3:) @3:33
This is the most Joe Rogan video ever
short guy with fake steroid muscles walking like he shit him selfe hahahahaah
The laugh 😂
This is the car America honestly needs. With all the guns and all
Bullet proof and ugly as hell. 🤣
I’m sure the cartels got most of them on back order 🤦🏽‍♂️
I thought he was going for the glass, not the door
Velocity is more important than weight of projectile.
Elon... ill bet you a dollar 😂😂😂😂
Hey cutie says the billionaire to joe in a wig lol that was to good
Because that's really what I needed in my truck. Arrow blocking capability. Yeah.
Elon is secretly supplying the public with military grade vehicles and weapons so they can fight back against the government
Those cyber trucks are fugly in shape ...but I still want one *REALLY* bad! Because to me, the functionality makes it one of the more beautiful vehicles out there!
Is Elon musk the coolest person ever?
Their showing is this to protect yourself from all the terrorist attacks about to go down
https://youtube.com/@mustafasha8?si=tOyjTx8JxvzCWAI8
The heavier the truck the less strenuous regulations, god bless capitalism and lobbying
https://youtube.com/@mustafasha8?si=tOyjTx8JxvzCWAI8
Joe the most down to earth person with fuck you money same with Elon Musk..
Joe Rogan dicided not to bring his A game (in terms of being in front of someone who is more intelligent science and business textbook wise than him) is hilarious in itself.  Joe ain't changing for anybody LOL.  That Arrow shot is impressive BTW.
I’ve un subbed to you joe Rogan.  I do not believe your a bad person , but lost .   You sit across from evil.  You speak to evil.  You engage with evil.  You smell evil.   Elon musk is evil.  People need to be more forthcoming with their knowledge.   He is bot a normal human .  Humans are shit , minus new borns, we are all all dirty scum . But Elon the devil musk is a different breed intently and entirely.   Do your research .  He is just one to name a few .
Am not an Elon but this was an awesome show
https://youtu.be/rNVfYWZdKQM?si=qqWHtnQYERtDPREk
"just ...beware of ricochets" said, as is the custom  *totally ignored* , as is the custom
Jesus christ this podcast s bad
Anyone know I can find the full video?
I'm loving Joe's new look.
Who is chewing FFS
Why is Joe wearing that wig ?
Hey cutie😂😂😂
Why TF is Joe dressed like Jimmy Savile? 😅 Does he not know what he did to all those kids? 💀
But did he try to shoot at the glass?
Oh thank you Joe you're smarter than Elon Musk and you know what will get through the truck that he created. You're very bright. You're much smarter. You are like an engineer. You are a master of all subjects. Go smoke some more pot
when elon said hey cutie i fucking cried lmao.
What about all the criminals that are going to have these trucks? How will the cops stop them
Elon ❤.... let's shoot my truck NOW !
it bounces off anD hits joe
Joe looks like your typical leftist fruit in that wig.
This is the "hold my beer" moment of the year.
fucking scratched it.  This truck is going to murder other vehicles in collisions😂
I see a cigar, but I feel like he's been smoking something else.
Imagine thinking you could pass an arrow through a bullet proof vehicle. Dumb af
Why does joe look like that tik tok kid that thinks he’s lil baby with the blond hair😂😂😂😂
“hey cutie” words i would kill to hear elon musk say. Joe u are blessed 🙏😭😭😭 4:04
Did Elon say “I’ll bet you a dollar” as a billionaire?! Haha it’s just funny he still has the “normal” people money in his head. That’s the most I could ever bet lmao
Ok, that was wild. I really thought it would penetrate.
So ill go ahead and ask..... why is Joe wearing the wig?
What about the millions of dollars this man took for pre orders on the cyber truck 4 years ago. Now not honored at the price millions locked it in at. So elon takes 100s of million from people 4 years later no product, no nothing . We need a class action law suit on this scheme.
Jesus, the chewing during the cyber truck arrow clip was brutal
Diesel swap that thing straight off the lot
Is the cameraman chewing gum or what? My god.
Will it become rusted heavily in northern New York's heavily salted roads in less than 2 years? Yup. Battery wont last long at -20 for a few days like we have up here. This might be fun for southern Americans, but will NOT work in the cold climates of Boonville, New York.
4:32 is hilarious. Joe fixing his hair and smiling at Elon.
Elon musk should look into the thunderstorm generator if he really cares about the environment
The best chance at penetration, would have been a 250 spine carbon or aluminum arrow shaft, tipped with at least a 175 grain bodkin.
Goddamn Jaime. I thought you were a photographer. Your focus was all over the place.
Cybertruck or really cybertank. As truck, just an ugly useless looking vehicle. It is a vehicle best fitted for criminals or maybe law enforcement (but way too expensive  for that). It is absolutely frightening to me a vehicle that heavy having that kind od acceleration. It literally is a weapon on the road in hands of rich idiots driving like they own the road weaving on and out of traffic like manics. Stupid ugly vehicle.
its strange to watch a gorilla shoot an arrow at a cybertruck.
“I’ll bet you a dollar”   2 men rich enough to bet a million on something stupid like this and it wouldn’t even matter. Yet elon sticks with $1.
In other words, street legal tanks for gangsters and rich idiots.
listened to this one last night, you could tell elon was really enjoying himself. dude probably never gets a break and being on this particular podcast was a rare chance to let loose.
Trucks should be tough!As a retired roofer I can safely say the competitions trucks are definitely not
Still can't tow a ton over 100 miles
These things will all get bought up by those who live in fear or actually need a bullet proof vehicle while overlooking the fact that Tesla could lock them inside and drive them off a Cliff should they step on the wrong toes…
I thought this was a Pingtrip video
Can someone tell Elon musk that smoking doesn’t fit him. He need to preserve his health, because it seems like because of wealth, he is drinking and smoking and destroying the most important structure
Anyone still excited about the cyber truck is an idiot thats still getting conned by musk doing what hes always done just generating interest and keeping this stupid truck in the media it all generates money for him ... people need to wake up musk has never takin this trucks production seriously
The camera guy loudly chewing gum tells a lot about how this is all just for fun
Why is Joe dressed as Jimmy Saville
I know a good PDR guy
Should have used a schwacker Brodhead 😊
9.mm mit. wolfram.Kern
Most influential dude and most innovative dude just being dudes "Bet u a dollar" "You're on".
Don't bet against a rocket scientist in a physics contest😜
I’ll give it to him that this is impressive but I still am very curious and concerned about crumple zones for passenger safety as well as pedestrian safety. How does that play out?
When does it come out on spotify
Elon learned his lesson, he smoked weed before the show, not on the show🤣
This is Rogan AF. If you threw in a chimp and some DMT it'd be complete.
This is fucking amazing
Rich people have way more fun 😊
Should of kept the wig On when he shit the bow 🙇‍♀️
what is elon wearing ? xD xD
Well no shit! It’s stainless steel, not plastic. Not impressive at all.
“I’ll bet you a dollar” 😂
Favorite Elon Musk Quote: "Hey Cutie" 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bet he has his pool cue with him too!!
The Cybertruck “Beast Mode” version will be the best truck ever made. Just the name alone will make people buy it. 🎉
This is why JRE is the best
Need eye protection boys
Elon is tall....
Love the sparks flying on impact!
bro the cameraman chewing gum is so infuriating 3:09
4:05 “Hey cutie😏” -Maniacal Harvey Weinstein laugh🤣
These two are kids at heart . Very enjoyable listen
Elon's got that billionaire laugh lol.
that wig alone deserves 10 million views
Is it Paddy Pimblett?
This interview is so sad and in the same time so infuriating because musk is clearly depressed of something (wink wink) and rogan is clearly performing a washing operation as written in the soviet book. All of you that are believing everything that rogan says, you should know that he is throwing hard propaganda in a sweet voice on you. Just pay attention on the actions of these entities and you will have the puzzle figured out: trump, musk, rogan, west, Russia. This podcast is no longer what it was since long time ago, it’s just a media tool for the above. Each session has a serious scope because it has power to change minds.
They in a fucking warehouse doing this? Shit man I wish I had this type of money.
I was expecting Elon musk to be like well. Im from South Africa. Bullet proof cars are going to sell well there
Nice T  shirt Puerto Rico  we # 1 Rogan, Elon  and Puerto Rican
For those who don’t get why he used an arrow, they may go slower than bullets but they have more mass, and are razor sharp. They might not have the same ability to go through multiple layers like a bullet due to a slower velocity but they can rip through most objects first layer easily
UH-OOOH! TESLA CROSSBOW *SPECIAL EDITION* COMING SOON...
this my favorite version of Elon
Those dudes are friends , love seeing those dudes together
Why has joe got a Jimmy savile wig on
good times gentlemen, thanks for the laughs
Please tell me why Joe is wearing a wig
Need a contract with law enforcement with that level of safety
"Hey cutie" 🤣😆🤣
Compound bow will punch to anything a bullet cannot🎉 I proved it to myself at a junkyard over and over again😂 I even shot a safe and had penetration😮
Is it grizzly proof though?
Elon and Izzy have a very similar laugh 😂
Did I missed something? Why Joe wearing Karen wig
Something looks different about Joe
Freeze the screen at 4:03....Joe calls that nasty little dent "barely scratched". You don't wanna be on the other side of that door if some lunatic fires a couple rounds at it 😳
this should be a series where the weapon gets a bit stronger each time lol
So what happens when the indestructible truck hits another indestructible truck
Now this is content.
Amazing
Try a field point
To be honest, the design is growing on me. Maybe when first seeing it, back a couple years back it was the shock value that no other truck looks this way. But stepping into 2023, it looks pretty cool
But why try to damage such a beautiful truck
Awesome! can't wait for my Cybertruck !!
This was cool!! 😂
he should have worn his wig while shooting
guy behind the camera molested that fking gum in his mouth tffff
Archers would use bodkins to penetrate armor back when. Broadheads are for unarmored peasants.
god elons a tool
Joe looks like my middle school lesbian softball coach that could out bench the entire football team.
Damn. I bet you a dollar !
I used to think that truck was dumb as hell and now the more I see it the more I would love to have it
I love their friendship
Why is Joe dressed as Jimmy Savile?
This was fucking awesome!
Sheesh perfect apocalypse car if it was lifted a bit and had a way to charge itself sustainably but you gotta imagine that thing on the road is a very dangerous car to get in a collision with I need to see some crash tests
Joe needs to dump the T. He doesn't look healthy.
I’ve seen so many fake Joe Rogan interviews that I can’t tell what’s real anymore.
jeez that probably would've pierced into the side of most/any other vehicle.
Jamie ...send the DMT bear ro get my bow.
The problem with the Cybertruck is that A) several years behind production schedule B) it’s made from hardened steel (I.e. no crumple zones), and C) that hardened glass sounds good versus road rage shootings but, when that electric engine bursts into flames from a modest collision…how are you getting out when you/the firefighter can’t break the glass?
Freaking awesome…how fun are you guys!
Wow... impressive. Now I can safely drive it through Sherwood forest I suppose
Challenge Accepted!!!
Love the A-Team reference
Is this a military vehicle or just for people with small penises?
he said be careful of ricochet and 3:32 you can see a piece fly directly towards the camera man haha
Joe flexing the Jimmy saville look lol
❤
Oakland,CA with cyber truck will be Chaos. This truck will be regulated soon. Thugs gonna use this truck for their activities.😢
I need this truck for driving Pennsylvania State Game Lands in Autumn
Now you owe Elon a dollar
This stunt will probably have the worst negative effect on the durability of the CyberTruck. It’s already bad that crazy people key Teslas, now this test with Rogan gives more ideas to those crazy people when the CyberTruck starts filling the streets.
Police need Cybertrucks. Lots of em.  I need one too. 😄😁
Man i fukken love this
Every rapper is gonna buy one.
Was that the arrow tip flying near the camera around the 5:57-5:58 mark?
Hey cutie haha
Electric cars are communist carts. They much worse for the environment. They are a sign of the end, not the beginning.
Awesome 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What if he shot the arrow into the window?
Using cars as cover only worked in the 60’s when they were made of real USA metal
You would’ve had better luck with target tips
Can a normal car not take an arrow or something?
HELL YEAH!!!
I didn't know Joe hair color is blond
Its interesting how smart, and yet clueless Musk can be. First his struggles to articulate why exactly manufacturing is harder than designing. Then his self-assurance that he would beat Zucks in a fight. Zuckerberg might be a "scrawny nerd," but I dont think that walrus maneuver is going to work as well as Musk assumes.
Now firefight in movies can be finally accurate, if they  hide behind a Cybertruck. Kinda sad I won't be able to drive it.
wld i fook allow that to happen to my truck
Elon Musk should watch the new south park episode if he hasn’t yet
Ok I’m an auto engineer and Bowhunter.  People you don’t know how impressive this is!  My bow is set at 70lbs (not built as well as Joe) and I could shoot right through the door skins of the vehicles we make at the factory I work at!  I know this, because on a scrap body a strong man can drive a screwdriver through them sometimes with a hammer fist strike. I have seen it done.  (don’t tell the safety guy boys will be boys)
45acp, 9mm, and 12ga(depending on the load) are fairly low threats.
The end of this episode is kind of awkward. Elon suddenly seems to be shut down from the conversation.
Kudos to Elon for taking Joe seriously with that wig.
Joe should keep the wig. Adds an element to the podcast 😂
who ever was filming the shooting part needs to never hold a camera or chew gun ever again. Annoying as fuck.
Joe looks like either an 80's lifeguard or one of the people from the Time Machine.
I want one of those holy shit
Is Joe wearing some kind of Halloween costume or is something else going on
Why is Joe Rogan wearing a wig?
just ordered a cybertruck after watching this thank you
A field tip would do better than a broad head.
When's the last time Elon watched a fckin movie cus they're still hiding behind car doors 🤣
This may be the best Rogan segment ever.  Love Elon's confidence as well. Pretty impressive. The funniest part was that Elon bet him $1 the arrow wouldn't penetrate his truck.
Hey cutie
Joe and Elon musk make a great combination.
The biggest promo Elon's evr got 😂
How long before Elon gets that door repaired?
That shot wasn't safe at all. The metal from the broadhead could've easily shattered and gotten into someone's eye. If you look closely a piece of plastic comes flying towards Elon right after. These guy should've know better and kept more distance and worn protective glasses.
Elon just said a 9mm and 45 ACP were basically a 10mm. Surely I’m not the only one who thought that was funny
where’s the logic in a crossbow could penetrate the vehicle but bullets can’t?
So it's arrow proof.  🏹 That'll come in handy if he's ever under attack from the Sioux.      So many ways that could have ended with an ambulance  🚑.         Good distraction from the elephant in the room though.  Give 'em that.  China 🇨🇳 and Musk's kinky relationship with the CCP and I'm betting PLA.    OOOOO THAT'S A BINGO!  😁
I mean... Broadheads are crap for penetrating hard things. Should try it with a bodkin tip on it 😂
I don’t like Joe with hair.  My brain can’t handle it.
Elon's gonna change the gun violence issue in America to crossbow violence.
Was the camera guys gum chewing not driving anyone else crazy?
That's awesome!
That's awesome!
I’d like to get to a point in my life where I can say…”you know what I just realized, I do have an 80 pound bow lying around”.
What a terrible idea. Did you see the shrapnel fly by the cameraman. That could’ve easily went into someone’s neck. That would’ve been quite a video
A target tip would have faired better than a broad head. Not saying it would go through but more likely!
Joe with the Puerto Rico baseball team jersey is golden🔥
Heck yeah these guys are fun
Joe loves to fuck with Musk all the time! 😂😂
The official car of dicks n posers club…
It's Ken from Street Fighter
This feels like something that would come up in the Dagoth Ur AI meme.  Instead of an arrow to the knee...
I'm so glad that the richest man with an incredible amount of influence is this man. A down-to-earth man with common sense and great values. He's funny and charming too. We're very lucky.
Who the fuck is chewing like that when Joe is shooting the cyber truck
Just a fugly azzed vehicle.
The fact that Elon laughs like B.Z from Santa claus the movie disturbs me.
7000 pounds 0 to 60 in under 3 seconds is actually insane
Impressive
👎🏼
I love the spontaneity, the physics going on musk's head, and both of them just screwing around for the hell of it.
Joe seems to be having a hard time looking at Elon let alone eye contact. Weird
Love the A-Team reference!
Just curious...if an owner other than Elon Musk wanted to repair that ding...how much would Tesla charge?
Gangs in big cities gonna be doing drive bys in Cyber trucks alllllll the time, you watch. They already buying up all the hellcats to be fast getaways. Now they got a bulletproof vehicle for under 50 grand? Lol they gonna love the Cyber truck.
We need a cyber truck vs a grizzly bear ppv on joe Rohan channel
You need a better cameramen
I was thinking about this guy alot lately and i came to the conclusion that its not just his intelligence zhat makes him so succesful. I might go on a limb here but there are many people in this world more intelligent than musk, its just that he has one if the craziest work ethics ive ever seen. The guy pretty much works 24/7 . That combined with his intellect makes him, well i guess the richest guy in the world ? I dont know if he still holds that title and im to lazy rn to google it . I dont consider myself very smart , i suck at math, logical thinking in general. I speak 3 languages but thats about it lol.
Cops should start buying them, put a LED panel across it like in Cyberpunk 2077 that just as POLICE tickering across the LED panel, would be cool.
This truck is likely better protection than some of the vehicles we move our soldiers around in.
the richest man betting $1
That hair looks RIDICULOUSLY good on Joe…a little TOO good😂
What the $&#$ is Joe wearing? Has all the world gone insane? Maybe there is a joke somewhere I am missing. But watching these old men like Bill Maher & Joe Regan smoking weed based cigars and sipping whiskey while they try to act all intellectual just looks stupid to me, and makes me realize why the world is on the brink of destruction. Very much similar to how the roaring 20’s was proceeded by two world wars.
Joe showing Bapa how to LEAN IN!
But Tesla car caught on fire guy kicked out window to live because everything stopped working handles windows. What happens if the windows are too tough and you just made burn alive oven you can’t get out of
lol joe looks like he should be singing 'yeah yeah yeahh y yeahhhhh'
No one mentioning the dude smacking on some food behind the camera while in the garage..? It gave me a headache
"barly scratched it", made a fat ass dent tho
Best is i guess hiding behind the front wheel so the engine is in the way?
Jamie please chew gum behind the camera.
Better pay that man a dollar Joe.
Just straight into the clip with zero explanation for the wig ...
how do we solve gun problems in america? just make bulletproof vehicles, DUH!
Elon is an utter disgrace but he's currently on chemo and rad therapy so I suppose it wouldn't be fair to hate on him too much
It’s almost as if there’s a reason you don’t make cars for normal roads as tough as concrete…
He-Man
Idiocracy on the way ..
We have reached peak Joe Rogan 🙂🏹
If you watch closely in the garage, you will notice JRs security guards standing at the ready to kill Elon’s security team if needed.
I wish these guys were running our country instead of the pedo parade currently in the white house
That truck reminds me of the vehicles in the old DOS game "Stunts".
Hey Cutie (fucking ☠️).  Elon is so damn funny!
Any reason why Joe is dressed like Jimmy Saville, complete with cigar?
Joe is surprised that an arrow didn't pierce a thick piece of steel door? Lol  There's a reason why knights wore full plate armor. We've known that steel can stop arrows since we had steel. Same with iron and metals in general if it's a sufficiently hard/thick enough piece. We've had whole ages of human civilization named after metals from stone to copper to bronze to iron to steel age etc.
Take my money please
Lol love this 😂
Joe = Nazi Traitor
Joe is so iconic bro a true living legend
Cameraman chewing gum driving me nuts
Joe going for the Jimmy Saville look
This is the difference of a marketing/businessman to an innovator.
That's some fresh fresh botox
Jamie stop chewing
So its built like a brick and can withstand an arrow, YET with no crumple zones, almost all severe crashes will kill you.. but ... BUUUT in a shootout you can hide behind your doors.. priorities I guess.
The only ev worth considering
I'm just wondering about crumple zones, pedestrian protection and the cost of panel repair on the cybertruck.
Yeah but can some hipster just remotely shut down your old f-150 while you’re having a shootout during a bank robbery? Didn’t think so
Any thoughts of having Robert De Niro in the podcast?
Y’all forgot about the tucker automotive movie. That was all about how tough manufacturing is
The next several F&F movies will feature Cybertrucks for sure
That is the ultimate vibes chilling with joe rogan having whisky and a cigar and mucking. So cool testing the durability of something the person in front of you had a hand in making
"I'll bet you a dollar" - Said the richest man on Earth
Boring company about to come out with a heavy crossbow
little joe is bad for hunting. lol love the guy but him doing anything hunting wise is so unnatural and awkward.
i think this is the first time i’ve ever seen Elon laugh let alone twice that’s crazy love these 2 together great pod
Team Rubio 🇵🇷
elon musk in pajamas, love it
Throw something at the window or im not convinced
Those mouth noises are making my skin crawl 🤬
Joe lookin like Tommy Rich…only the true og’s will understand this reference
Isnt this his old studio?
That is the new Batmobile!!!!!!!
Have u ever thought why we don’t build a hardened steel car? What happens if u crash the crash zone is gone, if u hit a person with that design it cuts people in half, what is when your EV burns or is thrown over and your windows r bullet proof, what u going to do. How the firefighters cut u out? It’s such a stupid idea to even try to built it, but people don’t c it, even when they alread paid and wait for 5 years an will wait another 10
😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
I can’t fucking take this seriously roe jogan. Take that wig off 😂
Thank you for this outfit. Still a hostage.
There Is the stranger chemistry between these two
I'm pretty sure he's dosen't try. He shot that brick with an arrow
Elon : It can stop Tommy guns, .45s,  9mm, and .380s.  Joe: But what about a REALLY powerful arrow???   FYI, he said his arrow goes 380 feet per second (fps) but a 9 mm goes from 990- 1350 fps depending on bullet size. I think joe is getting a bit too cocky or he is getting dementia.
No you hide behind the engine, even armored trucks you hide behind the engine when engaging. Any soldier will tell you this. Even armored trucks can’t keep every bullet out after some time. Nothing is bullet proof fully.
Tough truck  !!! Still hate the shape  !!!
Best Duo!!
why is the camera guy chewing so fucking loud while filming Joe
I thought Jimmy Savile was dead?
Didn't a baseball smash the window??  We won't forget that.  Interesting.
What's up with all the lip smacking and chapping sounds?
Did Joe really think a bow could out muscle a firearm?
Definitely need a "Joe's Garage" spinoff series.
Who is Joe dressed as?😅
Can I ask the question? Don’t jump on me.   Why is he wearing a wig?
Joe’s base arrow weight is 420… nice
Stainless steel isn't "all that strong", ie it isn't a super high strength alloy, so this vehicle uts (500mpa - less than half the strength of a tempered high strength alloy steel)) - simply has very thick panels ?? >2mm ??  Very little about steel (or stainless steel) behaviour is unknown or unknowable - ie. no magic at work.  Needs a mail bodkin..  lol (EM - still FoS). typical cars are very tthin, but NOT mild steel....  Yes it is weight optimised, but lso it has strength up to 2000MPa  - mild steel is ~250MPa
This was awesome 💯
Best clip I've seen in 2023 and in life in general thanks
Nobody going to talk about the fucking clown chewing into the phone???? Jesus
Bro this fkn camera guy's chewing gum right in my ear and cant focus a camera to save his life
Just guys being dudes🤘
Elon and Rogan best pair ever.😂🤣
this is for rich people preparing for when workers revolt
4:04 Elon: Hay cutie. 😂
Love the Dew Rogan. you need to do is commentate on the UFC while wearing a wig.
“Well now we know” 😂
I like how Elon acts like he gotta think when he already knows everything
Whisky, Weed, Arrows and Pizza. Those are best friends.
For non bow users: That 500+ grain arrow would have blown through the side of a f250 and lifted the truck into space if it was shot angled upward, so this cybertruck is the real deal
well i think we’re gonna start seeing a lot of cybertruck drivebys
Yeaaaa I have no doubt that someday I'll see a police chase but they'll be chasing one of these. No doubt.
The chewing sounds are disgusting
That was BaddAss ... I'd love to hangout with either of those two dudes... I had no idea that cyber truck was so impermeable
Elons hard to listen to
wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
The next day Joe has ordered a Cyber Truck
Gotta hide behind the engine of a car and unless they got some shit you should be okay
The two coolest people on the planet
wonder what brakes are going to try to stop something that heavy at that speed
Joe's preferred pronouns are. He and Man
Love how these guys get to nerd out together ❤️ we need more shows
Why does Joe look like Stewart from Madtv?
He-man
Should have used a practice tip
How cool was that! Love how they just got up and did it!
0:02 "HE-MAN!"
Has Joe lost some bet or what? XD
Now hes gotta replace the door...dented it 😂
Elon has got to make a cyber truck that runs on fuel or has a gasifier and call it the Apocalypse he'd sell millions cause if all hell breaks loose that's the truck I'd want, its a bullet proof battering ram.
Just don't hit the glass it'll shatter if you sneeze 😂😂😂
You beat armor with speed not with weight
Lmao Joe having a serious conversion with that wig on.
I didn't see Joe pay up on that bet.
Tf joe wearing😂
Wtf... why is he exactly looking like He-Man😂😂😂
That is a big redemption from the unveiling and the window being smashed.
The way he says "hey cutie!" 😂 👍 👌 You end to get him more to drink, I feel like he opens up a lot more
Hey Rambo.... Nextime try a 120lbs + yew longbow with a heavy ash arrow with a bodkin point.... (Grey goose fletch).... Could work.
So you can safely drive the sivertruck in the amazon jungle
all i can hear is the camera man chewing lol
Still a dent , from an arrow lol no difference than normal vehicle.
Maybe you would have done better with a wig 💪😂 really impressive Elon doesn't sell Chinese quality 🤭
I expected a full medieval crossbow, the heavy kind that you reload with your feet and hands
HAHAHAHAHA WTF
Let’s do it tonight……. It’s at your house? Let’s send someone!  Lmfao science at it finest, let’s do it and see what happens lol
This was so awesome
I enjoy listening to elon speak....its hard to explain....he talks like a politician, yet one who's actually interesting and you feel like you could trust 🤔 yes it does not exist haha
Bet you a dillar haha good stuff
Joe Rogan Looks like He-Man
Wow
I thought smoking ended like 5 years ago?
That was fun to watch.
4:00 "Hey cutie" - Elon 😂😂😂
Boys and Toys!❤ I love this truck Elon, keeps the richest man on Earth safe!!😎👍
Mad max level cars 😅
Slo-Mo! Slo-Mo!  Slo-Mo!
Elon: I'll bet ya a dollar * 😂
This was my favorite interview Joe had with Elon, very interactive.
Why is joe wearing a karen wig??😂🤣
They are both really smart. Joe knows alot of things people should. I'd love to hang out with them both
Elons first shipment of Cyber Trucks is going to the Tallyman 😅😅
Eating pizza into their mics for 5 minutes was fucking insane and they should be jailed for it
need to start thinking about the quality of these fucking teslas not power etc
Bet him a week of programming 🤣🤣
Frankenstein Unbound in High Quality | All Time Classic (Drama/Horror) @Riodot007 #classichorror https://youtu.be/d0n51sbs_LU
I’ve watched this around 6 times and it never gets old!! Love these 2.
lol
EVs are poo 💩
The title of this video is the most Joe Rogan thing I ever read
Joe looks like Jimmy Savile 😂🤣 what I’d give to be chilling with this pair. 🤷‍♀️
Joe lookin 2 feet tall lmfao
What is happening?  Why the drag?  Why the cigars and whiskey?
Elon interviewing Jimmy Saville? Wow! I never knew I’d see the day! Far out
Who the f**k chews gum like that????
is Joe dressed up as Jimmy Saville??
I legit at first thought this was gonna be ai until I saw the official channel.
Hey cutie 🤣🤣💀
I like the cameraman busting some ASMR chewing nastyness the whole time in the garage, what the lol
police cars should have this technology. but if you're a regular guy driving a bulletproof truck, wouldn't it inspire crazy people to shoot at your truck just for fun?
Joe owes Elon $1. 🤣🤣
He couldn't figure out what to do with Twitter though.
So many people in my community hid behind a car door and didn’t live to tell the story
Joe Rohan
I really don't like Elon musk because of his endless scams like hyperloop, solar roofs, electric semis, and the fact he pays his workers way less than he should.. That said he seems like a decent guy on these podcasts, I have a feeling this is how he is in public but there is a whole other side to him in private.
Joe always flex random man stuff
Why does Joe look like He-Man?
Dude i wish i got rich because the cyber truck will be needed when the world goes to shit
Think Elon has become friends with Joe.
Who is joe dressed as ??
Joe is so small. He looks so weird lol
Who tf is Joe supposed to be?
I love how Joe got all bummed out because he just destroyed a perfectly good broadhead
Why is Joe walking like Bigfoot from the Paterson film?
Elon now has a cool story to tell about why he has a small dent in his truck
These two! Lmbooooooo  Elon came in his smoking jacket so Joe dons a chin length Bob and fires his bow.
The Ugly Truck has impressive skin, bro! If I am caught out in the middle of a dangerous flash-mob in traffic - THIS is the truck to have! But still its too damned ugly AND its an EV at the end of the day. And EVs are uber expensive for replacement batteries as well as when the electronics get mucked up. My wallet couldn't handle it. It's a rich man's toy.
joe is a genius
Hey Cutie 😍
Best publicity for the truck go TESLA🎉
Holy shit…that’s actually insane! I’d drive it 👊🏻
Joe needs a big psycadelic mural on that huge wall of unpainted drywall
4:06 hey cutie 🤣
Love Elon. Straight up legend .
So, cybertruck is bow proof. That's what everyone wanted to know.
Is Joe trying to look like He-Man?
Thats so sick.
#Teamrubio 🇵🇷⚾️🇵🇷⚾️ Love your costume 😅🤣🤣
Rogan/Musk 2024
Got to below 3..... I'm out
Joe, I only shoot 550gn bolts out of my crossbow. Custom made but there's not a shoulder it won't break
Alex Pereira wants to know your location
Wth is wrong with Joe's hairs, is this what happens when u don't let them live on ur head for a long time and u keep killing their babies, are they now taking revenge??
This has got to be one of most watched podcasts JR has done to date.
CAMERAMAN PLEASE DON'T CHEW GUM !
We need more side quests like this on the podcast
I think Elon likes being around Joe, it's the only time he can be himself.
Rogan and elon need to do a podcast at least once a month if not more.
When he pulled the Arrow back. Then Elon said, might want to shoot it at an angle. I was like  Bro, dont kill Elon
Lets see Elon shoot the Cyber truck with a rifle round.
HE-MAN.. JOE    LOL
THESE GUYS ARE LIVING THEIR DREAMS WOW.
Where is the full episode!?
Now, Elon will have to make a crossbow to prove his point
Are they no talkin armageddon yet
It's actually great marketing for the cyber truck lol
Amazing to see how those 2 savages became such good and comfortable friends. They both know that the other knows what it feels to be so famous and rich!
This is cool stuff 😂
I would like to see it done with a field point. The blades are too weak but a solid point would be far more successful. Elon Musk is right about the crossbow as I am positive mine would easily penetrate the door with a field point and hit anything behind it.
LOl, joe's hair is hilarious.
imagine being rich enough to have a man shoot your car with an arrow and just chuckle. goals
“Let’s get a cross bow and shoot it at my truck”. This reminds me of when Johnny Depp was hanging out with Hunter S Thompson and Hunter asks” wanna shoot some guns?” So Hunter gets a propane tank and starts strapping nitroglycerin to it. Hunter would have been a great interview for Joe.
Wtf why is Joe wearing a wig 😮
Where can i watch the full episode
Top 10 most american videos on the internet.
The cybertruck is cool and all, but I'd rather not drive a vehicle that's anticipated to draw that much fire...
that will just buff out
Unless your Cam Haynes do not challenge Joe's bow and arrow knowledge, he is a real American Indian, Aho!🏹
With the cigars as well xD
Haha I loved that ! The camera man in the garage is the same guy that films UFOs and Bigfoot
Joe! Crossbow bolts are about twice as heavy as a roughly standard arrow.
I used to be a genius entrepreneur-engineer like you, then my cybertruck took an arrow from Joe Rogan.
buddy was chewing tf out that gum 😂 #asmr
They are so fucking stoned it’s hilarious
No eye protection 😮
“I’ll bet you a dollar”!  😄
I'm not I would go with the Jimmy Savile look
Heeman interviews the modern Howard Hughes
Why does a 7k pound pickup need a 3 second 0-60... I'm already waiting on the YouTube crashes.
they actually did it 😂😂😂
I want one
who cares this guy
just like that Joe shoot an Arrow into a CyberTruck. 😶
Elon goes from this to meeting the PM of England is insane 😭😂
These 2 together is the BEST
gotta use a field tip Joe. broad heads aren't meant to penetrate deep. field tips will go through most bullet-proof vests
I bet you a dollar 💀
Elon is already wearing a yellow vest before Joe brings out the bow
So much about this video is just wild. What world are we living in.
Elon musk betting a dollar! This is gold!
2:35 wow look at that. the force is no joke.
It’ll stop handgun rounds and he thinks a bow will penetrate…? Lol
Elon musk is a fck living legend! Hi from Albania
Musk will turn to real batman :) Imagine his personal toys bit illegal :)
you guys know plate armour stopped arrows right? why are you impressed by this lmfao
I see in the future ,parents with cybertrucks smashing through school walls in there truck saving there kids from school shootings!
Wait until joe gets the repair bill
But can it surive attack from 10 grizzly bears?
Elon Musk is a BEAST!
ure a coward joe rogan !!
This truck is great, Joe & Elon always a great combo, but I`m more impressed about how someone can chew a gum so loudly and annoying 😆
He should’ve used a field tip
Hey cutie😂😂😂😂😂
Just imagine trying to hate on Elon 😅
This was an ad for a cybertruck! I want one now thanks Joe and Elon
prolly shouldn't chew like that right next to the microphone .
Is that a Jimmy Saville Halloween costume?
Joe does sir Jimmy
Selling my 6.6 Duramax 2500HD for a cyber truck?
This is so cool.
This is the most man video ever
Who is chewing open mouth gum while filming? Am I the only one who hears this?
is joe doing halloween as jimmy saville?
This is the Rogan content that we need more of.
Nothing hit like a man in that outfit saying Beastmode version. Can only become something successful 🤗
The lads have cool toys huh
Rogan dropping SCIENCE Cocksuckas!
Joe's the type of person to tell Elon it's not going to work, and Elons the type of guy to build it just to show him lol.
I don’t like fanboying over celebrities but these two are hilarious
ELON, you are the most Awesome guy, just all around Awesome!!!  So cool, you participated in the bow experiment FOR EDUCATIONAL reasons AND YOUR TUCK STILL COMES OUT ON TOP vs a bow.   Just an outstanding guy Elon.
Elon has some broad heads too. At the house. Elon: Joe let's go! 💃
Damn, trucks cool and all, but I don’t know if civilians need armored vehicles. Imagine one of these fuckers going nuts at a parade.
would be funny when an order for 2800 pickups come from an unkown group in the middle east
No bulletproof Valentine
I can’t believe you destroyed his door lol but way cool to watch!
Joe being confident in his bow is so badass it becomes hilarious. That and the un-flinching answer of Elon which follows 😂
Due with camera chewing gum - almost unwatchable...guess the person didn't learn how not to chew like a cow.
Arch bikers?
I'm guessing at least 16-14 ga steel on that truck. At least the door panels. As a bow hunter knowing the capability Wow that is really impressive.
That arrow actually caused a pretty sightly dent to the door just think what rocks are going to do to it coming off semi truck wheels. This thing is going to be a road disaster and the chumps are fawning over the looks and "it's electric." Sure thing sheep.
If you want Buy a Tesla you know out there alot of Hater so probably you need a Arrow Safe Tesla! The Cyber Truck is what you need!
90lb compound that's big draw weight, what about a length of draw or let off?
I thought Joe was prince Adam from he-man lolol
who's chewing gum like a horse!?
It looks so cool
Wasted interview,i cant see elon doing jre again.looks like we have to listen to terrible adds now on spotify..r.i.p jre
Hahaha coolest video out there to date! Love it!!
Rohan!!!!!!!!!
As a British person, seeing Joe in that hair smoking a cigar... Let's say it has an unfortunate similarity to someone not liked here 😅
3:37 you can see the arrow tip that broke off bounce towards the camera..
Its a metal panel. What did you expect?
in the US a bullet proof truck is surely going to sell well if the other leading trucks don't have that feature.
Why is Joe wearing the wig?
Joe's fascination with so many area's of life is very refreshing.  I love chit like this! 😊
Joe Rogan wearing that wig while being all serious and casual, is the funniest thing ever 😂
First time he was on, Joe wore a pink shirt 😂 look at him now 😂😂😂
We need a Ridiculousness but of Joe 😂
How will people get out off the bullet proof windows if the batteries ignite? Also where is the crumple zone?
I can almost imagine all cars from the future just trampling over all cars of the present. Literally a Nokia brick phone and an iPhone wrapped in one
These 2 people will play a major part in saving this country. Listen to Elon talk about Twitter is a bit bone chilling. Loved watching these 2. Elon’s I don’t give F attitude is so awesome.
These kind of podcast are just wholesome this is why joe is the best
"hey cutie" 😂
Last time Rogan was entertaining was on News Radio…
this truck is an abomination still
is this real im so confused
He Man haircut 😂
He needs a Ranch Fairy arrow.   High FOC, mass, and structural integrity, I’d punch into the cybertruck. Lol
Get Connor McGregor on the podcast
Joe Rohan
That fcking chewing during shooting the car though 🫠
Can we please stop having smoke sessions while we talk, it makes peoples voices so dry and saliva sticky sounding like gross choppy cluttered ineffective conversation it’s like Fingernails on a chalk board, drink water and caffeine
Joe shouldn't be encouraging the most important human on the planet to smoke!!!
He's lost $40 billion.his rockets crash, his cars are junk.and this truck is ridiculous,  Twitter is losing money.  Hes a con man and peoplecare waking up.
The Rivian R1 is also 7,000 lbs.  The biggest question now is the range.  Can't wait for the delivery event next month!
Joe's a wimp. Can't he use a proper bow instead of that toy? A real world longbow.
I got something that’ll poke a hole in that cyber truck.
This is why Elon is such a cool guy, no matter what people say.
lol i have a compound and its "only" a 70lb and watching people struggle to pull that shit is funny
Always wanted He-Man to Host the JRE Podcast
I would have use a field tip.
did elon drive to joes studio in that truck ?  probably not because hes  driven everywhere with a security team....so who brought the truck ?? glad the truck won
Broad heads are for hunting, they are designed to penetrate flesh....... of course it will fail, you dumb twats ! A bodkin tipped arrow would go through that steel like it was butter
It’s strange seeing jimmy Savel talking to Elon
I think a field tip might do more damage to it.
Joe looks so stunning, so brave😊
This is the most "Male" conversation I've heard in a while 😂.  "Dude, I've got a 2 ton bulletproof truck"  Friend- "Bet I can shoot an arrow into it with my high impact crossbow "   -" I bet you a dollar you cant"   Friend - "Bet"
This one guy shot up cars with silver tipped bullets and it went through multiple cars. And all the people hiding behind doors. It was a real mass shooting incident.
The wettest chewer filmed that video
Guys full of shit. "Don't wanna give anything away" 😂 I don't know ,
CyberPunk 2077 CyberTruck   Will the latter live up to the hype and flop hard like the game?
I don’t think I’ve ever seen joe rogan not in a building
Sorry, but that truck is ugly as F!!!
its he-man masters of the universe haha
impressive im safe from bald guys in wigs shooting arrows at me driving by
Joes a breath of fresh air, and elon is worthy of so many accolades, the bloke genuinely loves the world.
What's with all the ads on the Spotify app? Joe is flogging something every 10 mins.  Has he not enough money!!!!!!! He is being paid by Spotify and now flogging insurance
Cyber truck vs grizzly next
I cant believe how fast Joe's hair grows!!!!
Hilarious loved it. But I am not surprised with the result b/c that is the wrong arrowhead for metal. You need to use a medieval-style warbodkin. Arrows like the "Crecy" or Type 9 war bodkin (Lond museum designation)  They would have a better chance of penetrating b/c they don't curl on impact like your broadhead. They were designed for precisely this task (armour penetration).  Not saying they will go through 100%,  but they are the arrowheads you need to use for hitting that type of material.   A 150lb English Warbow or a 110-130 Macnhu style Warbow will produce the same energy as your 90lb 520/grain @300fps arrow (140j ke).  However, they will do it with a heavier arrow (moving slower of course) but b/c the arrow is so heavy it will have more momentum which is great for penetrating armor.  A 110lb @34" Tiron bow my Misko Rovcanin Bows will shoot a 1530 grain arrow at 175 fps for 141 j(ke) and 5.29k m/s of momentum.  Your 90lb compound will also generate 140j but only 3.081 kg m/s of momentum. I would love to see someone try that.  .
Soo, why does have that wig on? 😂
Damn, He looks like heman, That's hilarious!  Good to see them vibe and have fun.
He building his army in plain sight
Jamie pull up that video of me shooting an arrow
I want both the cybertruck and that awesome bow...damn the prospect of a zombie apocalypse just got a lot more fun🤔
I wonder what the carbon footprint of that truck is.....
That a burp made it man, hahajeje!
THIS IS HISTORY!!
does a Ford F-250 weigh 6-7,000 lbs?   i should ask bing
I know its sooo cool but taking out dents and replacing the doors would be a bitch tho
My therapist: "don't worry blonde wig wearing joe rogan isn't real" meanwhile blonde wig wearing joe rogan: "i have some broadheads wanna try em' out?"
I really like Joe's hair in this thumbnail
Amazing 😂
Dana weat  wtf hh
ummmmm you him a buck joe
Imagine filming 2 of the most famous people on earth and CHEWING YOUR GUM SO LOUD Jesus f christ some people are unbearable.
Thank you for not being clip bait
Joe you are a fucken legend!!!
How much will that truck sell for now! Elon's truck shot by Joe.!
That’s so cool let’s do right now.!
someone forgot to tell the guy who held the camera while Joe was shooting the arrow, to take the damn Werther's hard candy out of his mouth, what a nasty sound. lol
love how elon said he’ll bet a dollar when he’s one of the richest people rn
M1A1 time
Joe RogHe-Man
Protect these two men at all costs.
These two men are probably some of the coolest people on earth for how much power and money they have along with the roles they play in society.  So glad they aren’t reality denying, delusional, common senseless Lefties.
My brain just completely ignored that wig on Joe's head. Wtf 😂😂😂
Musk watched too many Tate videos lol
They are so cute. Two toddlers trying to sound cool
That ricochet angle was straight toward elon
Joe… you owe Elon $1…!
“Is your truck bulletproof?” 😂
Joe Rohan
Great penetration test but tell Joe to be more careful
My wife is blond....we are never having sex again !!! The image in my head..Jeeezus
How is it, that all I can think of right now is: "yeah.....Americans 🙄"
If someone want to kill you they ain’t using a bow narrow it’s not the 1500s Elon is a spaz
Joe Savile
CANT WAIT TILL MY FREE CYBER TRUCK IS SIGNED SEALED AND DELIVERED..
HES NOT EVEN SMOKING WEED THIS TIME.. NOT BECAUSE IT GOT HIM "IN TROUBLE" THAT ONE TIME BUT BECAUSE SRIOUSLY WHO CARES? ITS LEGAL NOW.. WHO EVEN SMOKES IT ANYMORE?
That truck looks like a video game vehicle that hasn't fully rendered in yet lol
maruti suzuki cars in india is bomb proof 😑
How about a warbow?
Jo-anne Rogan Experience does not have the same ring.
DEAR JOE.. ITS A FUCKING ARROW DUDE.. ITS NOT A PROPRIETARY ROUND FROM AN MP7 THAT IS ARMOR PIERCING.. SHOUT OUT TO ALL DEM BOYS WHO USE THAT GUN BECAUSE OF ME.. ALSO ITS BEEN A FEW YEARS.. HOWS IT WORKING OUT? DID YOU GO BACK TO THE P90?
Poor Elon, how can u have a serious conversation with Joe wearing that hair!!! Enough to make anyone crack up!!!🙂
Why doesn't Elon ever mention how important and difficult the car manufacturing process is?
Okay but what exactly happens in the much more realistic case of a car accident having this extremely stiff frame?
that better not be jamie chewing gum and recording at the same time
Is Joe dressed as Pete Rose?
elon changing the drive by game forever!
Not impressed, let Demolition Ranch shoot it.
ELON MUSK DROVE THE CYBER TRUCK TO THE SHOW.. AND JOE ROGAN SHOT AN ARROW AT IT.. THIS FUCKING SHOW ISNT EVEN AIRED YET..
*bro is building Imani Tech 😂*
JOE: I WISH I HAD MY 90 LB BOW WITH RAZER SHARP 50 GRAIN TIPS ON ME RIGHT NOW... ELON: I WISH I HAD MY CYBER TRUCK ON ME..  NO ONE: SHOULD WE SEND SOMEONE TO GET THEM?
whoever filming mouth noises sent me
Da fuq is up w the hair XD
I could listen to Elon all day long. One of the brilliant minds of the history of the planet.
HES SERIOUSLY DRINKING OUT OF THE SHAKER CUP.. THE THING YOU MAKE THE DRINK IN.. HE DIDNT EVEN POUR IT INTO ANOTHER CUP.. THATS PRETTY EFFICIENT.. I JUST HAD SOME SHRIMP AND BACON ENDS (GOOD LUCK FIGURING OUT WHAT THAT IS) WITH SOME JALEPENO.. ITS A PRETTY GOOD WAY TO EAT JUST SAYING..
Puerto Rico! 🇵🇷
These should be 8 hour 9 to 5 podcasts
Who the hell was chewing gum during the test? 😡
The wig looks dumb af.... Like why?
You know we are truly blessed when God puts these two legends together for our own entertainment! Much love ❤️
We need more leaders like this.. That arent afraid of trying out shit that sounds stupid just to clarify that it works.  If it would have pierced it..He would just go back to the drawing board and release a version 2 in a few years..  Growing and getting better. rather then what most others will do..Just barely do whats needed.. And implement the smallest changes you can possibly do without increasing cost..and cheating the end cunsumer,
What world do these people live in
That laugh is unsettling as fuuuuuuuuuuck
4:04 “hey cutie🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣”
Id love to see them tapping the cyber truck with a medieval +140£ warbow with a bodkin point or a similar era xbow with bodkin tip. slight differance regarding tip as the broad head is very flat and optimized for cutting into fleash while the bodkin is specifically designed to puncture armour
For UK viewers, is this the Jimmy Savile experience 😮?
I love these guys
How is nobody talking about Elon clearly reading of a prompter?
Paddy Pimblett’s looking well.
I’ll bet you a dollar he says💀
Omg the gum chewing during car arrow clip 🤢🤮
Broadhead is a bad choice of a tip for this.
I love these 2 together
publicity stunt
Elon cracks me up smoking dem cigars😂😂😂😂
Elon Musk's algorithm has designated Joe Rogan to initiate peer pressure yet again and I am here for it.
If Elon calls it beast mode it’s a fuckin beast
The one dollar gentlemen's bet  got to love it !😅 too much fun we need more of Elon and Joe gentleman bets😂
Not the beast mode version lol
3:08 wtf with chewing sound?
The gum chewing sound at the shooting 🥴🥴😖
"We dug our own grave with cybertruck" Elon Oct 2023
That's fucking bad ass. 2 rich guys are like "lets shoot an arrow into this super expensive truck and hopefully i can drive home with the an arrow in it" lol fucking respect
you haven't seen mithunda hiding behind the cycle yet.
Why does anyone listen to musk... he has no idea about guns or bullets for that matter... it all depends... saying that all bullets will go through is idiotic... a 9mm at 50feet hollow point won't go through a car door... but a 7.65 fmj will. Such an egotistical sciolist
i wonder how that gum tasted that the camera man was chewing on so loudly
conner be like -- Who the fook is this guy😁😁🤣,  this rat is smelling!!!......🙃🙃🥲
i want one of these so bad, its legit a batmobile from the future.
should of used a bodkin tip arrow, that's what they used in war to pierce through armor.
Elon be thinking that mild scratch will buff out 😊
The comment section is full of assholes and beggars. People makes video, dumb watch it.
It's weird seeing Joe with hair since last time.
Joe is such a cool guy
Like the evil villain laugh after he shot the arrow
I know Elon is really busy but this should be a weekly podcast.
So funny hearing Jim Farley saying that Ford builds tough trucks to do tough truck stuff….yeah Jim, let’s see what happens when you empty a machine gun into an F-150!
This needs a rematch with a better tip and one with a crossbow.
I'm not exactly sure what it is, and clearly it makes no difference, but I simply don't like either of these humans. A lot.
Joe looks like 80`s he-man
A billionaire and Joe ... What could go wrong!
I bet you a dollar and then processes to  laugh in billions 😂😂
I love his laugh
BGM - Head sounds😁😁😁
Why did the resolution go 2 crap
this clip is so out of context!
Why would I want  bullet proof car? What about crumple zones?? What about 'fuel' efficiency?
Not the safest of experiments,  but pretty damn impressive
Elon has a masterplan... this is just one more step in the masterplan! He must have!😃
From the moment I learned of the Cybertruck's tough exterior, I began to suspect that the cartels will buy a *bunch* of these.
I wonder what would happen if you were to shoot a high powered rifle at it? Say a .270 or a 30,06?
Spotify does not work in my region. Kazakhstan. How can I watch this?
That was fucking Awesome 😎
Joe's preparing for the women's UFC 😂
The arrow didn’t take enough dmt
Does joe ask him about the bbc interview lol
That car just became worth twice as much
Government contract!
No matter what Elon answer JOE was going to reply by saying Whow
Cool
0.36 he said engine in cyber truck
Joe looks good blonde with long hair
Joe rohan 😂😂
I feel like a 1999 toyota could handle and arrow too 😂 probably not even a scratch.
You can tell Elon likes being in the presence of Rogan. Sort of like hanging out with your big brothers mate.
The best hahahahah such a dope test!!!
Woahh Rogan
Elon claims a .45 has more penetration than a 9mm round and I would love to bet him($1 or more if he accepts) that he is wrong. I personally tested a bullet proof vest sample with a number of rounds. The 9mm hollow point penetrated 2 layers of material(kevlar) more than the .45 and 2 or 3 layers less than a 9mm ball round. A .223 went right through like butter, through 2 telephone books and then about 14" into hard desert ground.12 gauge birdshot was stopped on the first layer but made the vest sample disappear into the phone book(at point blank). I also tested a .45(ball) in my buddy's 12' pool. Mythbuster's erroneously said that you are safe under water if someone is shooting at you. Wrong! .223/5.56 disintegrates and turns into small shrapnel almost at the surface(but I think they should've tested different angles. In my test we shot a .45 at a 45 degree angle and it hit the 12' bottom hard enough to dent the bullet and the bottom of the pool, bounced up a couple feet and slowly fell back down. We were pretty sure it would penetrate a body. But I wanna give Elon the benefit of the doubt that he is partially correct. He mentioned his .45 tests were done with a Tommy gun. So with a longer barrel than a 9mm pistol I'm assuming the .45 had more velocity and more penetration.
Drug dealers and connects everywhere are buying cyber trucks🔫
I had to look into his costume. At first i thought he was he-man 😂😂😂😂
This must be the most epic podcast on jre. I love how comfortable Elon is with Joe, they really found some special friendship.
Was that bow a PSE?
the cameraman for this piece of video history decided to chew gum with their mouth open, yay autism!
How long until cop trucks are cyber? Prolly when they realize they're semi bullet proof. Lol 🤣
A brilliant pair of idiots. The world needs more men like JR & EM!
Not gunna lie.. that’s impressive. If only it had a big lazy diesel v8 with 700 mile range fuel tank
Proof that we are all just kids at heart
Whoever is chewing gum like that should be publicly shamed
JR looks hot as a blonde!!! lol
Joe doesn't understand ricochets
That was badass. My next car is a cybertruck.
I like these guys friendship.
Not to shit on the Cuck Truck, but you don't want car windows to be shatter proof in case you crash it and need to be rescued (doors often get jammed shut in such cases)
So Elon can maybe sell to the police as well
The cybertruck is never coming out, tesla is fucked.
Such a great bromance that continues to evolve in great ways
Yea lets do it right NOW !!! LOL
Joe clearly knows shit all about steel and projectile physics.
Joe appears here to be the intellectual avatar of The Heman: Master's of the Universe 😂
its not really impressive when hes desighned it to do that and it weighs 3 tonnes. we do have bullet proof cars and range rovers
I’m calling bs on Elon!
MSN. News headlines Joe Rogan pays tribute to Jimmy Saville😂😂😂😂😂
I'd be so mad if someone dent my car like that
The tiny dent it left I wonder how easy it is to buff it out?
I must of missed something why was joe wearing a syrup
How long before police departments start buying these?
Fire the bubblegum chewing cameraman goddam that was hard to watch with that terrible noise in the background like he was chewing it in my ear 😢😅😅
Gotta love elon and He-man
a cigar gives a wise man time to think.  and a fool_some thing to stick in his mouth.
He-man
Joerge Sprave on that truck.
Am I the only one who was annoyed by the sounds of the cameraman during the arrow shoot? I’m sure it was equipment related but sheesh it was irritating. Sounded like he was smacking on an entire jar of peanut butter
"Cybertruck is bulletproof" - *shoots an arrow at it*  I'm waiting for Demo Ranch to get one and unload everything he's got at it.....
So yes, because it's cool and he can. Haha love this guy
When Elon said "Hey cutie," to Joe, I couldn't keep my laugh silent. This was so funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I want it, but because it’s American, I need it. Gotta represent and show some pride in US brands.
Definitely my favourite so far.
Blond wig & cigar, UK people needed to look twice 😮
This will be used as a security vehicle for a lot of elites. Cool truck.
joe looks like squidward on tht commercial ha
joe also have non binary fantasies, first step toward disorder i think so
You have the most popular dude and the richest dude in the world and they both just come off like you two lit uncles at the Halloween party lol. I love it were all the same
😂😂😂
Now I actually want to know if there is a weak point in this vehicle or is it entirely, 100%, impenetrable.
OMG a 7,000 lbs vehicle doing 0-60mph in less than 3sc is dangerously fast.
so....a truck that weights the same as a ford f250, tows like a honda civic, is unable to go in a cross country trip without tripping owner's fuse and still putting people on the line to pay thousands of dollars for it? THAT IS IMPRESSIVE....
Yeah, if it could do a 600 mile run, I’d love to use it for Escorting oversized loads…. Or the Tesla semi pulling a Super Load.
Well if that isn't the best marketing trick...I don't know what is...can't wait to watch the video Elon talked about shooting the door.
Great, now I know Comanche won't be able to get me in this truck!
some slow motion camera close ups would be dope
This is entertainment mahn😂😂😂😂 imagine getting this from 2 old reach men 😂😂😂😂
Why don't you tri it on window
😂😂 " hey cutie"  "thank you 🥰"
wear some eyepro next time!
I wonder if Joe paid him a dollar....😂😂😂😂
Elon is so down to Mars guy
Joe representing 🇵🇷 thanks Joe
Did Joe ever make good on their $1 bet?
What a life. I’m having a ton of fun just watching! Thanks again, boys.
Sorry to be the one, but....no eye protection? That's tarded
Now that’s some great advertising.
joe looks like he-man which makes it so funny. also, when i watched this on spotify i was SO happy he actually had the bow and they cut to the garage scene. only for elon do you shoot new footage angles in the studio
Why is Joe dressed as Jimmy Saville. A little out of order bro.
Anyone else seeing the potential for cybertruck in the police market?
Lool, why is Joe wearing a wig? 😂
Fun fact: cop cars have ballistic panels in the doors.   Also fun fact: take cover on any side of the front of a car, as the engine block can potentially stop rounds. Not an EV though.
Regarding the arrow stunt, how can it mean anything without demonstrating its effect on another car, truck brand?
lol they almost died
richest man in the world says i bet you a dollar im DEAD
If it is a beat mode version I hope you plan on paying Marshawn Lynch his due. At least have him in a commercial or two.
you guys are sooo amazing
Ant Jolya !!! Haha 😂
Imagine getting 100 million dollar deal to run your podcast and invite cool people. Joe living the life
Dude that thumbnail😂 Joes costume is perfect wtf😂
Police cars have shields in the doors inside armored plates in modern police cars.
Joe is the best, Elon is just as awesome.
I thought it was CGI or  A.I.  he really is wearing a  wig 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is hilarious 😂 Joe really wanted to get through
hey guys is it cool if i come hang out ? no big deal.......red lobster MY TREAT !!!!!
Can you imagine if the arrow bounced off into Elon.
You should have @thunderfoot on. He's elons biggest fan.
Not only Joe shooting an arrow at elons ride, did anyone else hear the cows feeding in his shop the whole time!!?? Multi tasking at it's best
Don’t even fix the dent, because the value of that Cybertruck has skyrocketed because of this!
This is what I need :)
They say smoking kills brain cell ....the lies just keep debunking
I just noticed that he is dressed like the guy who looked like him in the baseball game LOOOOOL
Lol i'm sure them people living in the jungles are gonna be trying to get you.
no gum chewing while filming the demo.
I love how both of them are like "let's do it now" , "ok". And they did..gold!
“They” finally got Joe to dress like a woman. Controlled much?
This is some rich dude 💩 lol
That gross smacking sound Elon makes with his mouth drives me nuts
Pure gold! Lesson in spontaneity for us all. Free flowing minds... Beautiful!
Camera man chewing gum. Tosser.
Who is this guest,
is goe getting gayer everyday?
Who's the tosser chewing gum behind the camera.
This just proves men no matter how intelligent,are assholes...Funny,but assholes non the less...lol
The reason modern cars are so "flimsy" is because you want the forces of a crash to crumple the car rather than the person inside of it. This ugly piece of shit does not belong on the road.
Gaddamn this is like the more mature, substantially more wealthier version of Jackass and I love it. Lmao
@Joerogan I loved your Halloween costume.  Team Rubio from Puerto Rico🇵🇷♥️ The blonde wig🤣 from the World Baseball Classic
Whoever designed the Tesla truck is so lazy! And it is the ugliest car ever!
Now, some things make sense, 😊
Love how joe hates stopping a episode to go pee but this tested the archery manhood SO HARD he left filming midepisode to test it 😂😂😂
Musk please never explain hiding behind a car door again from bullets we all its bullshit but cmon if i thought i was going 2 die id hide behind a blade of grass i know it aint bullet proof
F******K ....!!!!\ wow.
I think Elon likes Joe!??????????
Elon after that police fleet sales.
The crazy part of this pod was the end when Elon started talking about AI his body language and everything changed , I think he's very worried about AI
Get Kentucky Ballistics to test the cyber truck
Now, need to call a Paintless Dent Repair tech to remove the dent from that truck. May be fixable.
Hide behind the engine block ftw and to not die!
Wooooow. Best segment of all time.
Elon and Joe are epic together
well, now we know :D
Okay that was way cool !
Joe Rohan ❤ , also the screams of pizza bakeries world over going "you want what on your pizza!" 😂
Musk is making electric-bulletproof cars for those urban areas 😂  Everything except actually punishing the crime.
Joe Rogan got comfortable and is getting lazy on his podcast game... What's the point if he's not going to ask any interesting questions
This was 2 hours of literally nothing. I expected Joe to ask a lot more interesting questions
so man watched a movie with bullets shot at cars and said "that's not accurate, car doors aint shit" and went ahead and built a car thats bulletproof.
Getting baked and shootin bows at cars...  great to see even billionaires and millionaires have an inner redneck ❤😂
Con man
Why does Joe look like he man who likes baseball ⚾
Musk is such a grifting scumbag
Are the windows bulletproof too?
I was gonna ask if this works with bullets. Then Elon said "unloaded a tommy gun".  Nice.
3rd party mods of police variants gonna be epic!
What are they going to do if criminals or terrorists get their hands on these trucks and start using them?
“….Well now we know” hahahahah as he fixes his hair into place
Fabulous secret powers were revealed to me the day I held aloft my magic...
Elon is so hilariously full of shit I feel so bad for anybody suckling on his status
Speed beats armour.
I thought Joe was going to target the window with the arrow not the body. This kinda felt like an advert for the Cybertruck.
“Hey cutie”😂😂😂
hi cutie, HaRhARaHar 😂
4:00 Why does Joe look so yellow?
Whoever was filming in the garage needs to never chew gum again.
Damn at the stabilizer on Joe’s bow 😮😮
so as a kid elon watched people hide behind car doors and thought cool, found reality of that and thought, why don't i make it ho i saw it and came up with the cybertruck. 🤣🤣
The gum-chewing-sound in the garage is absolutely grossing me out.
Why is Elon not in his Halloween costume?
Elon topped Joe immediately after this interview
It could be one of the greatest spinoff it Joe started just fucking around in the garage and make shit blow and explode. I would pay of watch it.
This is why Joe Rogan is absolutely the best! Elon says let's do it right now! What more of a marketing presentatio would you like? SOLD!
Unwatchable after 03:00 due to cave man smacking on a gum like a savage barbarian
Joe has to be one of the coolest MF on the planet. Interviewing arguably one of the smartest humans in the world while being so intellectual himself with a blond 90 wigg on, while talking about facts is incedibile
Best Podcast in the world!!!
Elon: Hey Qt
Damn I’m glad Joe is bald… if he had hair like that he’d be destined for a podcast with Jake Paul..
why is joe rogen looking like Heman?
Straight gs right here 💯  ya diiiiiig!!!!!!
"BY THE POWER OF GREYSKULL!!!"
I was sure this was one of those ai videos
Next time Elon is on I won’t settle for anything less than Joe asking him if he wants to do Karate in the garage.
Wtf is Joe dressed as He-Man? 😅😂
“I’ll be you a dollar” can only come from a billionaire.
Americans like there drugs
Joes got that HE-MAN vibe going on with the wig!
I think he put the wig on to have a laugh about the photo of a dude with blonde hair at a game with the caption "nice try Joe Rogan"
3:32 for those interested
try the tire. lmfao
THAT'S NOT JOE ROGAN!!!! THAT'S "HE-MAN" MASTER'S OF THE UNIVERSE.
“Generally…” Chinese people look Chinese. Every time he says it.
W
When is the full podcast released
if it were coming straight at you but your body would prob do more than the bow.
He looks like Heman
You used to be able to hide behind a car, to avoid gunfyre, nowadays though.. 😂
Elon is such a cool guy! You want to do it right now? Lol
I still think those trucks look like props made for the movie RoboCop back in the 1980s.
they chatter like ol women. lol.
It's a pity that he didn't talk about why they couldn't solve, for example, the front wiper, safe driving on icy, snowy roads, off-road, mud, and they didn't deal with aquaplaning either. A good solution to these would be more important than acceleration......
😂😂 Joe tried to match wits with a man that makes rockets 😂😂
In a world full of woke lunacy i thank what ever diety for Elon Musk and Joe Rogan ❤
Hi
Joe wins Halloween 😅
Okay but imagine having to have a car that does atleast 2secs just to outrun 5-0
camera men please stop chewing gum while filming.
I love to see/ hear these two interact so naturally relaxed.
Haven’t watched one episode on Spotify
Lol imagine some compton boys getting a hold of a cybertruck lighting up the neighbourhood. Some sees a cybertruck rolling up on a house...oh shit son. thats an unfair battle.
The truck features are sick but not totally in love with the way the truck looks. I would still roll it tho.
Joe. The He-Man we need.
elon got tha only tesla trucc that actually works
Live Action He-Man looks great
Guy behind the camera needs to stop chewing!
Dope jersey.
thank fuck if the indians come back, my family will be safe.
anti tyranny vehicle
So if you do smash your Cybertruck. You wont be able to fix it.
don't know what horse is behind the camera chewing like some vegan
It would be hilarious if Joe went trans genga
This is first time I ever seen the pod stop to do anything let alone shoot crossbows.
Elon was like ‘this is gonna be the best free commercial ever’
That son of a Bi.....ch with the camera chewing his gum almost made me go mental
I can imagine many out of world city's and towns to be called Elon.. Roads,,, this man is a gift ❤❤❤❤❤❤
camera guy slurping on the mic needs to calm down.
Elon sold out with that shady loansharkin company #hertz.   You dgaf about the brand. i just wanted to uber and i have a computer, social, comedic, background in multiple fields of work especially hospitality aroun the city of Chicago. thinming about making a real video on the HERTZSCAM bro.  the price is a total scam. you pay ovr double, th websit doent let you successfully make an accout, they remote brick your car if a payment doesnt gothroug, even though bank satements say otherwise. noone even called from hert and now you are SOL STUCK IN A GEYCARIWASPRAISING   DUDE. I SOLD SOME OF YOUR CR, BEEN IN SALES FOREVER, JUST BEING NATURAL ON SO MANY RIDES. i know i sent you many customers.   ON THE SOUTH SIDE WHILE DUDE SAYS YOU GOTTA PAY TOW HEN YOUVE ALREADY BEN PAYING WHAT? 100 extra a week for that? good luck to anyone that isnt an armed contractor like me that already works in thse parts. survive untill hertzdaddy opens back up.  dont even get me started on condition of vehicle or th fixes ive done myself.  elon, dude. ur tires seem to suck too.   this is blatantly an evil situation, takes a lot or me to have to be thegood ovr it, but its just bully stuff in all honesty, everyone is depressed and struggling as it is, your vehicle experience is now a big part of that in my memory.  i wont even go into thestructure of hrtz or my location i got mine, nor the employees. but what a greedy, uninformed, poor judgement to sign off on suc a horrendous company with your ...-Passion Elon.  slum lords make it impossible to pay the rent, even when you have it.  whatnwould you cknsider my current [yeah man, IM SITTIN IN IT RIGHT NOW} inhuman, cold, automated experience?  this is a sham, not a dream. im requestin my phome calls gettin my own people involved ifit comes down to it. tow company better not lose that one i need it for any common sense jury or arbitrator to give me a win. ha  2/10 4 mileage and uber. THEY CASTRATETHEIR FLEET VEHICLES, YOU WILL END UPN RDNTING A SUPER LIMITED FUNNY, QUIET CAR.   . .. OMG.
Elon just made the next cop car 100%
I used the same product that oil is a miracle and shows what the power on natural product is…
This clip doesn’t show how Joe got the wig on, so I’m wondering…
Bro tell me about it… When i bought it I thinked it was too good to be true. But now i have my hair back. Just buy the product and see it yourself
I know you don’t belive it. i was the same. But now i have hair and got rid of my dandruff.
I know. It helped me too. I taught it was the end, i will never have hair again. But then the magic oil appeared and aved my hair and life. Just buy the Renewahir oil and you will see what the hype is about.
Hey guys, got news for you. 6,000lbs is a little bit more than most tacomas. It's not a heavy truck. Lol
Elmo tries so damn hard to look cool 😂😂😂😂 captain ass burger just looks like a moron
Base line vehicle for mad max scenerio ;)
WHERE TO BUY?
Whoever's eating chewing gum with their mouth open is munt
how to buy?
This is peak masculinity haha
Nicely done, are you guys sharing the view money? How much is a f350? How much is a cyber truck? Cybertruck-f350 = gas/maintenance for years 😂  More weight means less gas mileage and it depends on the job, if you have money you can just drive for fun.  Nicely done, at the end of the day its money in your account 🎉
whys this edited like its AI lol
Elons laughs after the shot is priceless
My South African brother Elon umfoka musk🇿🇦😁
Free Palestine!
Try a five seven
Hahaha boys will be boys!
I seen tesla truck in pecos tx
U didbt shoot the glass lol?
Elon was like shoot an arrow? Bring it on! The aftermath was Joe Rogan🤯
You know it’s over when Joe took his wig off
He won't be back. Elon got so tired of Joe rambling and correcting  him about mma and Zuck fight he eventually makes an excuse to leave. He won't be back.
Why does this sound like a parody, AI generated Joe Rogan Experience? 😂
why is Joe wearing a wig?
I saw the one of these truck on the back of a tow truck neear san diego the other day!
Whatever that is, it's not a "truck". A truck is utilitarian in nature and designed with function over looks. This "bulletproof EV thing" that the Electric Jesus is peddling is a pure status symbol for shallow folks with too much disposable income.
love to know what its like being on elons security team, like they must of been shting their pants at that event, especially and arrow parts flew between the camera and joe so there was a close call there.
Thumbnail made me think he was dressed as xqc LMAO
Joe, you look good with this hair piece!
I fucken hope he drives it around like that and never fixes it.
Maybe to most dislikes?
I adore Men who are eccentric never boring,  he wore a wig for a reason, got the interview with the man he admires and they had a off the record laugh!!
1:52  I ALWAYS ONLY BET PEOPLE DOLLARS.  I knew I liked this guy.
That's why I like Elon Musk he's always trying new stuff let's do it you got an arrow let's go🤣 I also want people to remember the richest man in the world staying in a $50,000 house
Boys will be boys ahaha, thanks for being such a cool guy Joe! making Elon smile this much :)
anyone else not seeing the sh*tload of issues this truck is going to cause?  From accidents (crushing other cars) to criminals using it.  Nevermind if it becomes the new "Toyota" that we see terrorists in the middle east use.
Best content of 2023!
Looking like He-Man 😂
Elon really likes coming to the podcast
I love how they did that right away during the podcast elon just smoking a cigar ahaha
Uh do you think Elmo drives with extra plating on his Tesla? duh the regular one I would like to see when it ever comes out...
This truck is inherently unsafe for pedestrians and other drivers, it has no crumple zone so it will crush any car it bumps into. Terrible visibility as well. I can see road deaths being alot higher.
Love their impulse to try it, on the spot! LOL
Joes whole life has led up to this moment, he would now die a happy man)...
They would be awesome at a Zombie apocalypse.
I love how Elon is so twisted he makes the leap from "you know how IN MOVIES people would be hiding behind car doors...they'd get killed. So I got rid of that. Hey, simple" Yes...because we all live in MOVIES where we get shot at while driving our car or truck! Idiot. He is a dipshit. Part of me feels like Elon bragging about this crap will dickheads opening up on CyberTrucks sitting at the lights. A family bought one, cruised to the beach, windows down  some gang bangers pull up beside. "Hey G! Isn't that one of them bulletproof Elon Musk cars?" The gang opens up and kills everyone inside and some of themselves due to ricochet. This kind of car is dumb unless you're a rich boy who grew up in South Africa during and just after apartheid. Then it makes all the sense in the world. But only to that little boy.
The A team was great tv … Mr. T was the coolest … the main guy would always say I LOVE IT WHEN A PLAN COMES TOGETHER … also had a crazy guy named Murdoch 🚁🚁
Joe and Elon just amazing 😅✌️
You guys are awesome
You guys are insane 😂 Joe you thought the bow was going to do it 😂 you guys rock o ya the wig😂😂
I love both these humans.
Great. Now we'll have douchebags driving in armored trucks. What could go wrong?
Elon is always lying
I wonder why he took the wig off to shoot the bow
joe rocking the paddy pimblett look
He’s shooting a g5 montec.  Those suck.. You need a tuffhead
Fun times....very impressive!
I have a ford lightning. Ford set the bar high with that truck. Hope the cybertruck is better than the lightning. Lightning is crazy fast and  luxury quiet too. Telsa has it qork cut out for it.   Would be awesome if telsa price protect preorders like ford did with the lightning.
Joe you owe Elon one dollar! pay up sucka!😂
Jimmy Saville wig and cigar combo ain't gonna age well
Just for comparison, what the arrow may have done to a "traditional" car would have been nice but stepping away from the table & having a billionaire do an "everyman" thing could be a very good promotional tool. Well played gentlemen.
Elon musk is insane. Thanks for the videos. You’re the best
Hide behind the engine block or tires and hope for the best
Pay that Man his dollar Joe...😆
Two of the coolest seppos ever
Joe tries to do dmt with a cybertruck
I'm gonna tell my kids this is He-man
Joe tries to do jiujitsu on a cybertruck
Elon is a cool guy..I'll love to hang out with him for free
Why would you be chewing gum like a slob while filming???
Only on the Joe Rogan podcast!! Respect to the GOAT 🙌👊❤️🇺🇸
How does it do with 5.56?
heman
Jesus christ get him some water my headphones jesus
That gum chewing is gonna have me lose my shit
Thanks for testing the arrow I was wondering the same thing
is this even real tf
Joe is getting old
Flash Gordon
He’s not wrong about the hiding behind car doors thing. Most of the people I know who’ve been shot have gotten shot either inside of or hiding behind a vehicle in a futile attempt to escape bodily harm
Elon could've said coz America 😂
Imagine if this was how we lost joe or Elon. Guys your too valuable to do shit like that without proper precautions.
If it wasn’t for Joe, we would never see this side of Elon
bro who is chewing behind the mic 3:08
We must protect many men in order to have a foundation for society, #Elon #Musk is absolutely one of those underdogs we must keep safe.💙 They attack him for a reason.. (Beautiful spark action when the arrow hit the truck, btw. A seriously tough truck.)
This is so funny....that wig really makes me giggle. Joe and Elon are something else. I love them
They should recreate a camping trip like Henry Fords and T. Alba Edison did, alpha male camping style in the forest.  Make the podcast there please!  The four vagabonds JRE!!  Great minds having great conversations in the wild.
Too cool to be a billionaire,
300fps at 90lbs is pathetic
A bow(arrow) does have more penetration than a bolt, Joe was right.
What I found interesting (but not unexpected) was Elon sitting there already designing something that just might be able to penetrate the exterior.  Crossbow bolt design, in his head, in real time...  If he EVER started a weapons company, it would be insane!
The joe and Elon episodes are my all time favorite. Two G’s in a pod.
Just so you know Joe, the weight of the round/projectile isn't what makes it good at penetration (arrows/bolts are a bit different in this regard). For firearms, speed is what defeats armor.
Hey Joe the blonde wig goes great on you😂
Man if that ricochet and killed joe damn 😢😮
Elon is to phucking cool for real.
What I love about Musk is he can hold a completely ok conversation with a dude who looks like he man singing heyy heyy heyy heyy ohh.
Elon is sexy. And not money sexy. Smart sexy. I think Scott Wolf should play him in a movie.
That is fing crazy
Aye yo WHO TF orders an Anchovy & Pineapple pizza  a Fookin' Fugazi that
So if it was like a Mario bullet. Then it would break the cybertruck ?
Lmao 😂 I didn't realize what the costume was until now 🤣
Elon’s the fucking man dude!
The games the filthy rich play
That is so dangerous wow
You have to hide behind the rims
Cops use car doors for cover all the time
Is nobody going to mention the fact that Elon is smoking a cigar!?
Please quit smoking Mr Musk!
The fact he wore wig on camera once.. the girl one . Means he sold soul . Hes also one of em now. On role  putting all these agendas out
imagine being so rich you let people shoot an arrow to your car
Hold on Elon I'll buy one soon... apparently Bidenomics is putting more cash in my wallet lul
What was Jamie chewing, jesus
Kids..😅😅
Does somebody know, Joe's hair stylist  name ?  I really like his hair 🤣
Joe should have handed him a buck
A hunter arguing with a physicist. I liked how, with zero ego, Elon mentioned that what matters is energy by unit area.
I used to bow hunt and elon was definitely in a spot where he could have been shot of that arrow ricocheted. Totally unpredictable when arrows bounce off things. 😂
I want to see the clip of them eating the pineapple anchovy pizza 😂
Please wear eye protection
probably should have been wearing safety glasses..
What is elon smoking?
Hopefully the truck isn't too high in price
Crossbows are moving at over 1000fps these days. Google it.
“Bulletproof huh?”  “Yep.” “Is it arrow proof?”  “Well… We haven’t tried that yet.”
*Wet mouth sounds*
Imagine having roadrage with that thing. OOHH LORD. People gonna get smeshed
Joe looks like a 70 year old chainsmoking bleached grandma in that wig
I know Elon Likes his woman blonde, but this is too much
Elon and Joe, please don't ever change! 😂
He should have done it with the hair
The smotching eating noises in the background are awful and annoying…
That was amazing
I was certain that the thumbnail for this was AI generated.
srsly Cyber Truck is a beautiful truck. stfu
1:54 .... listen if a 45ACP moving at 900 FPS (230ish grain) can't, a 115grain 9mm moving at around 1800 fps can't,  or a shotgun (varies but 00 is .30 at 1000 fps lets say)   there isn't a single arrow that's going to touch it much more than a scratch.
Joe rogan just went OG on podcast
so many rich people in one room doing something crazy and no one had more than a potato to record the moment on?
I shoot hunting bows, I have since the mid 80's. That is IMPRESSIVE!  We need one with a Cummins Diesel!.
Elon's laugh after Joe failed sounds rich and right.
These 2 together are absolutely mint 🤌🏼
Halloween with Elon and Joe !!
Joe rogan looks like Jimmy Saville love child...with the wig and cigar.
So it can withstand bull ets but if you drive thru a little sea water will the batteries ignite/explode?
2 of the most well respected trust worthy guys in the world right here .
Elon's laugh sounds like his Illuminati friends
Do troons realize 90% of them look as good as Joe in a ric flair wig?
1:04 Elon says Cybercar.  Slip?  Definitely gonna be a Cybercar as the robotaxi.
but it does in the cyber truck! dang thats cool
Joe: "Why did you build it that way?" Elon: "Who doesn't want a bullet proof truck?" Me: "You're damn right!"🙌
Joe rogan turned Elon to a stoner
only problem is that it has no crumble zones so would be illegal to sell in Europe
This is the most boring man in history
Time to go meet the uncontacted tribes in it.
Best duo ever!
Such an awesome episode
No pun intended to joes bent arrow 😂
why didnt he aim for the window lol
Grate video,
Not pint point i meant to say.
This is so cool
Joe Walsh.
That’s a tank 👏👏👏👏
The pint of this interview from my perspective is just two people enjoying one another and speaking on topics that the world needs to hear. On top of Elon musk and his wealth. Sidebar... That truck is a game changer read between the lines of were this world is headed they know something. Don't let that go over your head.
Too much lip smackin with the wig on makes me cringe
"I bet you a dollar" lmao 😂😂
Whoever is filming loves his MDMA lmaoooo.
Entertainment has reached a point where we can't tell what's real and what's an AI generated absurdist parody.  Rogan wearing that wig was certainly the correct level of "respect" to bring to a conversation with the likes of Elon Musk haha.
Jaws of life just became obsolete, nice
When did Joe get the power of Grayskull
How much of an idiot are you to think an arrow has more energy than a pistol or rifle round???
Elon really is the real life Tony Stark...
The only reason Elon will have two ounces of a smooth whisky neat is Joe is cool. Other reporters are like the person who got in you’re family by marriage and you keep you’re mouth shut to keep the peace ✌️ when you’re saying to yourself, “ What the f*ck did they say.?”
This guy should do the pickup part of the whole truck now. maybe do it roll proof AI integrated shit.
I see people praising elons hair, HE IS USING "RENEWAHAIR" Hair products. THANK ME LATER!
The funny thing is that even in real shootouts people hide behind cars while shooting each other...it gives a false sense of security
He man
Joe Rogan, porcelain is harder than titanium, sharp and heavy. I'm thinking a bolt with a porcelain broadhead.
Who is Joe supposed to be? He-man?
Does Joe ever ask Elon where he gets his materials for his batteries from?
dude said barely scratch but u can see the big ass dent...lol
Puerto Ricooooooo 🇵🇷
As a billionaire I respect this man’s opinions
“You know just wherever it ricochets” I love confidence on Elon
What did i miss? The arc where joe gets his blonde hair back?
We need a show where Joe invites people over and talks to them for a few hours
Ya I wouldn’t thing a bow would compare against a non soft tissue target… that head is not standing up to anything bulletproof….
So fucking great vaping before going to bed and watching this
Elon had me cracking up when he said he would bet a dollar lmao 1st  thing that came to him $1
Joe: let's do it! Elon: Sick!
how will this be legal imagine if a psychopath gets a hold of one and starts ramming people in the streets with it also if this car hits other cars the other people will get destroyed in the impact ?
oh wow the guy who sells his truck has nothing but positive things to say about it.
It's winter now and I should have painted the rust spots on my truck before it got cold...but I didn't. I  would love to have a stainless truck I never have to paint.
So, this the kind of conversations stoned smart people have?
You gotta love the attitude.
3:13, but that chewing sound, tho. Gave me chills and not the good ones :D
He built it like that so ppl can go around saying hey shoot my truck
Chillin with a billionaire hey I’ll bet you I can shoot an arrow threw your truck lol
Shopping cart manufacturers are finally able to breath.
Yeha but it can phantom break and kill you before any bullet  will ;) elon wont comment
the start of mythbusters 2.0
I like Elon and its all fun. But, can the cyber truck haul my trailer 100 miles at the very least? and is it affordable by normal truck standards? I don't give a fuck if its bullet proof.
Joe was even shooting a FMJ shaft and his kinetic energy was strong for a compound.  That truck is not made of cheap over seas shut down American Manufacturing who made metal, jacked thousand of American workers and when said and done the Amount they claim to save overseas manufacturing is a lie.  The trillions to pay unemployment to all American workers who got sh*t on, the bribes, government assistance, loss tax on workers, shipping, port, container fees, quality falling 75%.  No it cost the people tons and made a handful billions for screwing us
Can a Cybertuck be keyed by some jealous vandal?
Just two regular people talking about regular things. This is home to most of the American public edit: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
My dream is to bring putin and elon and trump in a podcast together i believe the internet will break
Damn whose the cow recording that arrow shot? Chew louder
electric cars are sooo gay
I would love to have these guys has friends. They seem fun to be around.
“I bet you a dollar” one of the richest men in the world, yet he still understands the importance of a single dollar🙏🏼
A 9mm at an avg 990 fps can’t penetrate it but an arrow and 300 fps will penetrate the truck. Ok joe lol
https://youtube.com/shorts/LKoW-JQ7QVA?si=JU8HE7OMC1a9yume
“Genius” obsessed w combat sports and war?   What happened to peace, love n understanding?   No genius.
school lunch vibes
This truck is good for any democrat controlled city.
HYSTERICAL.
He looks like Stuart from Mad TV
Hey Jamie, don’t chew gum next time 🤦🏻‍♂️
This is proof Joe is meant to be bald. The hair hurts my brain lol
Corporal Klinger?
Billionaires should not exist.
Both gents are awesome. I think Elon is such an important man of our times...
Am I trippin?! Or is Joe really wearing a wig?? If he is im not part of it no more no cap!
Did you see the spark? When the arrow hit it sent sparks flying
Didnt laugh this much for long time during the whole episode 😂 good one
its obviously going to be a better truck than any competitor but WW3 is on the horizon so thats just how the butter melts.
Love it happy Halloween 👻 everyone Joe sick fit😅
yay
i cant take him seriously with that on his head😂
That cool
Elon needs to get his pants lengthened I thought I saw his hotdog hanging out the bottom 😂😂
Let's be honest, everyone will need a vehicle like this in the future due to the Mad Max society that's been created.
He not only tries to shoot an arrow, he does shoot...
Worked with repo’s, every caliber will make it through both sides of a car. It’s unnerving as fuck.
Pistol calibers bounce off windshields, so it’s not super impressive. Try a 5.56 or 7.62 and see what happens
Elon is such a cool dude man.
This made me smile 😂
Looks like the ultimate suv to me 😂
THE SOUND OF THE MOUTH OF THE PERSON RECORDING GIVE THEM AN ARROW
THESE TRUCKS ARE THE BIGGEST PIECES OF SHlT EVERY MADE.   EVERYTHING HE PROMISED WILL NOT BE A PART OF THESE TRUCKS.   The stainless steel will discolor and warp and will never line up with the other parts  The weight of this truck is fvcking insane.  Everything about it is pure shlt
The "A Team" lmao!
i cant belive this isnt a parody
Did Joe pay Elon the dollar?
He said ill bet you a dollar
Imagine if the door window came down.
Amazing
Elon's sinister laugh after the arrow was defeated is pure gold! haha
4:03  «Hey cutie» «Laughs frantically”  Never heard Elon laugh so hard😂
Cybertrucks soon on sale in the middle east
The motivations behind Musk's products is what worries me. I think he's a douche. Why would you want to bulletproof a vehicle ? He's thinking about war.
The 3 of us would be best buds. I love cigars, booze, cars and science!  Let’s hang out!
The last hour Joe was roasting Elon with examples for Elon not to give an excuse to call the fight off vs zuck lmao! Elon, “ yeah, sure, okay, cool, good.” Lmfao!!!!!!!!! Poor Elon was lost and didn’t know what to say.
Nice hat Joe.
Practically what Joe did is to make a chip on Elon's truck. As tiny as it was it costs money to fix for the rarely of the truck. 😂😂 Who will pay for that?
The top 100 comments are fools who love a good advertisement.
anyone think elons hinting at something with the bulletproof trucks>?
Elon better start making Hydrogen powered engines because Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, BMW, Volvo, Daimler. Nikola Motors and Bosch will be far ahead after Electric cars become a fad. Too expensive, heavy, and use up too much resources to produce, and recycle.
Wasn't that fkn truck supposed to be on the market years ago
This is life
Amazing  !!!
Just a couple pals after school having some juice.😊
What are you guys smoking?😮
Dude I love Elon. Such a chill guy.
Joe is on DMT if he thinks he can shoot an arrow through that. This is like 99 percent of people who believe they can kill a Bear Hahaha.
I would love to be able to sit down with these two and just hang out and talk.
When Elon first debut the Cyber Truck, he said he was using the same stainless sheet steel  that he uses to make the bodies of his rockets/space ships. So I infer from that , the specs for the Cyber Trucks body are determined by the engineering requirements for the rockets/space ships. Cool video
Fucking awesome 😂
Caveman Joe takes on the future truck
Elon with a cigar ? waow
Yooo when Joe walked up to see the damage the arrow made on the door he literally looked like a little gnome next to the cyber truck.
hes smoking!!!!!
It's still a giant turd..
that was awesome, too bad the boomer can't manuever a camera lol
Some idiots will see a Tesla truck & try to snipe it.  I'd rather bullet proof an AMC Pacer & go grey man.
Amateur shooting the video smh
From the title I honestly thought this was just some deepfake lol
So where can one hide f bullets are flying? At the tail of a car?
Building stuff like he knows what's about to go down
Had no idea Joe was such a big fan of Jimmy Savile. The ultra vapid Elon spouting his lies as usual.
Hearing a nerd say: beast mode version 😂
Question of the week:  Will this emergency, unplanned appearance help Tesla overcome the market correction we witnessed this week? How powerful is JRE; we'll know next quarter.  Productions hard😢😢, no more excuses Worlds richest man, look no further than reducing your compensation for the first possible solution.
damn Joe is short
Joe looks like Heman
Anyone else see the arrow head fly at the camera? flies to the left of frame.
I would be more impressed if he said the truck can stop an ak or an ar15.
Both these guys bought hair.
Today I learned Joe does not understand elementary physics
I literally did a fist pump and said fuck yeah when the video switches to the warehouse. That was amazing content. These two are a dynamic duo
Csnt wait elon shoukd mske one for whistlin diesel
Damn that was cool
I want my Cybertruck to come equipped with a blonde bob wig.  Also, can we take a moment for Elon's green suede jacket?
I need one of them trucks
This due is legendary. Start an army. Or something. I’m in 😂
Joe remimds me of Eddie Money in that wig😂 but fek yeah cyber truck for president 2028
Elon Musk's laugh is like a villain 👹
Is he rocking the paddi pimblet
Faraday Errythang
PR tshirt broo 🔥🔥🔥
It’s amazing what JRE has become supercool seizing stuff like this, so unorthodox compared to the msm.
Best gentleman's bet ever lol. Beware of ricochets though 🤣🤣🤣
The truck is garbage
best podcast ever this is so random haha
That is one big wiper!  How does that even reach the left corner? Does it extend and retract while rotating?
🚨 In Case y’all wondering.! Joe is Dressed as “Yadier Molina” when he played for Puerto Rico 🇵🇷⚾️⚾️⚾️⚾️⚾️⚾️⚾️
To whoever decided they could just violate my ears by smacking whatever they were chewing on while Joe was shooting his bow, I hope you step on a Lego.
WHAT IS SO GOOD ABOUT A TRUCK THAT CAME OUT OF A LOGAN'S RUN MOVIE🤔
arrow can shoot through bulletproof armor
He build the batmobile😂
FANTASTIC!!!!! 100%!!!!!! THESE TWO ROCK!!!!
Lol
Damn, that was awesome watching!! "Hey cutie" BAHAHA!!!!
Oh hell naw bro you just shot my car. Wtf
I've got to give it to Elon. He is the marketeer. Watch this lesson on how to sell ELECTRIC trucks to Neanderthals. 😂😂😂
Joe don’t test Elon and his engineering, you are way out of your league my man.
What happens when you are trapped inside the cyber truck and battery erupts. Every think of that?
thats some rich people shit, but i love it, the ability for 1 millionaire to ask the other billioniare, hey do you mind if i shoot an arrow at your 120k pre-production truck? sure have at it, lets do it. total rich people shit, which again im here for it!
I go back and forth on wanting one of these.  Its bullet proof, but stuffed full of interior cameras and tracking software.  Maybe in 20 years ill find one with a dead battery for cheap then gut all the electronics and LS swap it.   People who want a bullet proof truck dont want all the other Tesla BS.
Holy shit
safety first
Great timing https://youtu.be/nuHEbfxjhoY?feature=shared
Whoever is chewing so loud into the microphone is annoying AF & gross!! BRUH!!
I love how Joe just happens to have second bow lying around
The gym chewing drives me freaking crazy
i dont think there is any better duo in this world then these two guys...absolute no f*cks given...would give an arm and a leg to hang out with them for a day!
Omg Joe 😂😂😂 stop it. You're too  hilarious.
Yeah!  Tesla is not advertising! :)
What the fuck I missed another interview with joe and Elon… pass Elon the blunt
Can’t believe these men ordered and then ate pizza while on the podcast. Legendary. The Musk Affect
Puerto rican shirt on Joe ❤ 🔥 🇵🇷
ELON IS COOL AF BRO
HAHAHHA that was crazy
An f250 does not weigh 7000lbs lol
Just glad nobody caught shrapnel from a ricochet!
"you might want to do it at a slight angle" Joe completely ignored that and shot it dead on lol
This is the perfect example of two High friends who want to find somethings out.  1:02
2007-2011 Ford Crown Vic police cars came with bulletproof front doors. From what I’ve read those doors can withstand AR-15, any hand gun and saved a lot of police officers’ lives. I had a 2010 CV police package and I pulled the door panel and it was thick metal and covered with Kevlar panels bonded to the door.
Elon is the Einstein of our generation! And he’s fun to be around cause he likes to have fun!!  🤘🏼Elon 🤘🏼💯💯
Two clowns. That is all
They’re both stoned out of their minds😂
Sick
Cant use a normal truck for cover. Seen a video where maybe the engine block would be ok cover.
Be sure to chew gum nice and loud while you video next to Musk.
what bout the glassss
If he calls it beastmode and doesnt give one to marshawn lynch im officially done with elon
Am i the only one who forgot it was Halloween?
I didn't know Elon Musk is smoking, I thought he was some sort of Vegan
Terrifying to think of a 7000lbs jagged bullet broof box travelling from 0-60 in under 3 seconds  Goodluck to anyone who ends up in front of one of those
the fucking gum chewing man, jesus christ
"I think we should do it rn", "okay let's do it"
Jamie was munching that gum
Coolest dent story ever! Haha
Rogan definitely lost a bet 😂
I DON’T Want One, Ever.
Shot out to Marshawn Lynch
He-Man ?
Fucking love Elon. Badass!
Elon is a genius guy and very humble ❤
Men will be men females will never understand how cool this is and why we will talk about this for years lol
4:03 Elon: "Hey cutie" *supervillain laugh* I love this behind-the-scenes energy, and I love how he proposed the stun himself in the first place
Did Joe ask him where he gets his cobalt
came here cause of the shirt🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🔥🔥🔥🔥
They should make a version where the doors are removable and they can be used as shields to get to a location from the car? That'd be sick
Two rich ass moooo foos beting $1 hahahahhaahah hilarious
Bro, thats Joe Rohan!
Elon and Joe are legends 🎉🎉
is rogan paddy pimblett ?
This is so badass and also why I like Elon. He’s way over most brain waves but him being cool enough to let Joe shoot the thing but also designing it that way from scratch to be strong , safer, rugged etc. practical stuff!!! That’s all I need ya know. Give me practical all day, sick of the hogwash whitewash….
Dude! Joe just shot an arrow at Elons, Feaking truck, and didn't get arrested or sued! Wt flaming F?
Legends
Who builds a tank like truck! This guy!
Wtf was the cameraman doing while Joe was shooting the bow. Jesus that was annoying
Smart eye-pro there Joe....
Why "because trucks are supposed to be tough" Damn straight Elon. If this thing does get over 300 miles per charge , I am in ! Bad ASS
That was a pretty solid episode.
omg that slurping sound
Thanks for making sure the insurance rates for cybertruck are gonna suck, elon
I have long said that it would be very interesting to see a life-sized vehicle made as tough as those RC controlled model cars that go 55+ MPH and survive crash after crash after crash. I looks like Tesla did it.
Elon’s lawyers sphincters are tightening… someone gonna get hurt trying to hide behind a cyber door.
Elon's been on Joe's podcast how many times now? 3 or 4? I think Elon really enjoys Joe's company. He can relax while having some stimulating convo.
I didn't see Joe pay Elon his Dolla' for not penetrating the vehicle!  ~  LoL
Elon: Hey cutie  Joe: 🥴
Love this clip, 2 guys with F U money enjoying a cigar and shooting arrows at trucks. The American dream.
OMG.. Joe's making fun of Logan Paul.
Barely scratched it ? Were you watching the same thing i was ? It left a dent in it.
I had no idea there’s a new joe and Elon episode!!! And I have Spotify membership!
Joe dressed up as a 90's gym teacher
Nice to see one of the children of the corn grew up happy!
Ok, but can we talk about how Joe's podcast studio is a motherfucking warehouse?
He Man 😂
crazy mofos
Joe, host Elon once a quarter as he can use your platform to keep us on board. I bet he will be like Andrew Tate trend for that quarter.
So what.
good to know...🤓
I feel embarrassed for ever was smacking their lips while chewing that gum so obnoxiously. Made me almost pull out my hair. 😐
Happy Halloween!!! Who looks more like a hobbit?? Love everyone Happy Halloween
He-man
120 lbs compound I have
The more I watch Elon the more I think he’s a demigod
That's hilarious that you asked to shoot a bow at it and he was so curious about the results he accepted immediately.
I figured he shoot the window why tf did joe think he could shoot that arrow through metal 😂
Joe almost killed our leader
🍺😔🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's the He Man podcast.😮
2023 can’t surprise me anymore!  2023: Joe Rogan with Hair
My Matthew's monster wake with an 86lb draw Is pushing my 520gr arrows at 306fps and I shoot THROUGH archery targets so this is EXTREMELY impressive and only reinforces my conviction in Tesla and my long term investment in Tesla.  💪😉😎💪 WELL DONE ELON AND YHE TESLA TEAM 👏💪👏💪👏💪👏💪
OmyNo
imagin being able to say i shot elon musks tesla truck with a bow n arrow.. n he let me.
Smart Elon tactic to get Joe to stand next to the cyber truck. So now we know the cyber truck is about the size of a Prius.
I'll just say this... I've never seen Elon and Batman in the same room at the same time...
Caveman tries to kill truck for it's meat
We should equip our law enforcement vehicles with cyber trucks, that would be sick!
good to see you finally growing your hair out , looks nice
If the design was not a smooth but more rigged surface with grooves to dissipate the energy. You then wouldn’t see a single ding 😉😉😉
I could watch these two guys on a podcast forever
I didn't realise Joe was disguised as his dopleganger ! Omg!
Why is Joe wearing a Jimmy Savile costume?
hahah  Joe: "I think we should do it"  'Elon: "Absolutely"  Joe: "When do you want do it right now?" Elon: "yeah we can do it right now"  If only dating was like this
Puerto Rico!!!!🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
Elon is again talking without saying a word, the reason he built it this way is that he will sell it to police forces everywhere, or so he hopes!
Damn bro Ford is in for a lot of trouble when Elon drops “Built Tesla Tough”
This is Elon Musk going insane with his ideas. His electric trucks in One fleet of Transportation company would take ALL the Power produced from POWER PLANTS AND GRIDS for an Entire City meaning the city has to go without power to charge one fleet of electric Trucks.
lol awakenbeerus just made us hella money
These two guys are legends!
Crossbows are made for armor has this dude not played aoe4 😑
joe has crazy hgh head and face
jre field trip
is joe identifying as hillary clinton?
Why is Joe dressed as Paddy the baddie on halloween lmao
Joe Rogaine
My 2 favorite guys just chillin and talking about everyone's needs😂😂😊
How much money do you have to have to shoot an arrow to a basicly a tank just because you have both things in the garage...
Matt from Demolition Ranch needs to test the Tesla out with his arsenal...........
Joe trying to look like Rick Flair…. Whooooa!
you expect he will admit it? he is not crazy
That was cool
People are going to chop this up 😂😂😂😂
Just guys being guys
Blond Joe talking about compound bows kills me
These guys have become good friends.😅😅
Men are craszy
What's with the girl who's holding the camera making mac and cheese noises?! 😅
Dammit. Now I want a cyber truck. It’s going to really help in my neighborhood.
👽🛸
Super high right now, this was awesome - all hail the Cybertruck, don't deny your feelings about it (you know you want one).
bot? made money myself.
0:48 I don't want to give it away and this is what I'm fantasizing about; Blah blah blah. It is beast mode bladie blah. This guy is living in a fantasy and Joe looks horrible in that wig. I mean why?  Anyway, I have bigger problems. But I do not get this interview.
Joe keeps playing with his wig. I think he misses his hair!
JoRo need to chill 🤣🤣🤣
target tip might have worked 🤓
Just standing there as shrapnel flies everywhere
those who are saying it is a bot are dumb af hahaha
Joe you are nuts❤
These two together lol.
I’m absolutely loving Joe’s Jimmy Savile Halloween costume. 💀
Stop cuckin musk
There is something most attractive about Elon’s quietly spoken confidence.
I love to watch interactions between REAL MASCULINE MEN. They are rare breed in this day and age.
Best video i've seen in a while with all this depression around me, thank you for the funny! May there be new memes for shooting a crossbow into the truck XD.
Hey Cutie😂😂😂😂😂😂
Fun fact: The top of the cyber truck is only 5 feet!
was a bit skeptic about it when he first shared it but somehow it played out exactly as he said it would
7000 pound to transport an average of 220? THIS IS FUCKING STUPID
What Joe is wearing? hahaha I can't...
5:30 sure sure ; he knows what is yet to come ; building that thing ! Super suspect 🎉
The full podcast episode is really good
God i cant wait for my CyberTruck... i feel like a kid waiting for christmas.
Joe repping Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 again, respect from a Puerto Rican.
awakenbeerus is a G, thanks to him I look sports differently lately
Damn chewing that gum so loud
Elon is getting us ready for ww3.  Always thinking ahead
this dude is just implementing his childhood fantasies.
smacking his lips chewing gum recording two rich ass dudes do dumb shit for fun nice
shouldn't we build police cars from the same metal lol
All right Joe Rogan what's with the wig something you want to tell us😂
Jamie pull up that time I shot an arrow at elons car 😂
he got that #TeamRubio drip
just admit it already
Mullet Proof CyberTruck
Even if i had all the money in the world, n even if that ' Truck ' shat out gold nuggets every mornin , i still wouldn't buy it . Ever ! I rather a 1998 Dodge Caravan 😂
The wig went back on backward 😅😂
say it joe.
“Hey cutie “ fucking legend
Okay, NOW I want my own Cybertruck!!!
5:40 hes right, youd have to hide behind a wheel or something
lol awakenbeerus just made us hella money
Im normally frugal but I think im going on spotify just for this full interview😂
Elon knows he’ll be safe while traveling thru Sherwood Forest! 😂
you expect he will admit it? he is not crazy
Gawd, just the break I need from thinking about Ukraine . . . Gaza  . . Bud LIght . . . Trump . . . Biden . . . inflation . . . climate change.
Lol Joe wild
I didn’t know Elon was on again, looks like I have something to do for the next couple of hours
Speed kills armor
Nice Joe, new look ❤😂
I'm glad to see Elon Musk on Joe's podcasts. I was getting tired of the comedian guests that aren't very interesting to listen to
4:05 Elon officially found his evil billionaire laugh
Joe teaching Elon math and physics
Bwahaha… that “truck” is so lame
I think Elon just loves being different with Joe, he gets to smoke weed, drink and shoot arrows at his truck. Real Guy Shit! I can dig it.
I ❤ Elon
Is that Bruce Vilanch
Whats the deal with the hair? Did he lose a bet or something? Lol
Hurry up and give us the Tommy gun video Elon!
So many mouth noises in this clip
Cool mad max stuff!!❤
Yet again, jre making another moment in culture we will all remember
The sound of this guy’s dry-mouth is annoying.
Now you gotta add oil slick and roofing tack dispensers and I'm in. For those of us that hafta work for a living. We can't be opening up boxes and searching all day for our oil and roofing nails dammit.
at first i thought he was dressed as He-man then i saw the shirt.
I love watching people of the Rohan podcast who don’t smoke cigars but will take one when Joe asks them to have one. The main giveaway is the way they hold the cigar. You can’t tell they don’t know what to do with it
props to elon but god DAMN that trucks ugly
Dawg behind the camera was enjoying himself, Jesus LMFAO
Elon is betting on a Mad Max scenario for the future.
How much is it going to cost to insure a cybertruck?
WOW  😍😅 Had to Watch  this Again  , 🩵 Luvi it!!  SUPER GREAT VIDEO, 🩵💓 An  a Bit of Comedy 😅💌 ..GO JRE  🩵 GO Musk!!🩵🧡🇺🇸🇺🇸
How about talking about Nuerolink and MKULTRA?
really wish the cameraman wasnt chewing fucking gum in our ears
Joe looks so old in that wig.
EV Hummer is so much better and cooler, unless your on elons dick the Hummer is so much better
Joe doesn't know that when you're trying to defeat armor small and fast is important.
This is the best I've ever seen Rogan look. Maybe now he'll have the courage to interview Trump.
Alright.. Aim for the tires.
The only reason I don't like joe is because he entertains Elon's ideas. And so far Elon is just good at selling snake oil.
It should be called the CyberJunk or Cyber Death Trap. It floats FFS. An off road vehicle that floats!!! Think about that. It amazes me that people who are so incredibly smart can miss the so incredibly obvious.
Joe is like that one friend you tell I’m not drinking tonight and end up hammered and can’t get home 😂
Looks like #1 client for these Cybertrucks should be the police.
Rogan is on Whisky and Weed while Musk is hitting the Ketamine pretty hard.
As time goes on, Elon becomes more and more of a Mr Beast, but for adults.
That fucking wig lmfao
they need thick windows so u cant hear people call u a faggot thru them
These are the two greatest Americans alive right now.
What is this car for? It would be fun to see uncle Joe riding around in car tank
Joe looking so serious and ridiculous at the same time is too much for my senses
What’s Joe’s custom?????
Hello elon I'm in brownsville and have a interview tomorrow I visited starbase today amazing what I seen today
This is why we live shorter lives than women and I approve lol
Hmm something tells me we’re Gna need bullet proof trucks soon
To be fair, Elons cars are really good at deflecting arrows. Teslas have actually saved 1000s of people from arrow attacks already in just the few years they've around
Lets test this truck at Demo Ranch..👍👍
I'm not part of the Joe Rogan circle so... Can someone please explain to me wtf this man is wearing right now?
But feel like you're mocking Elon. Are you mocking him? Is that really how you look? No.
2:53 Your wife when shes in the mood after 30 years of marriage and a couple of drinks.
Yo am I the only one   Who's Spotify glitches when I try to watch this episode? I've been trying to watch all day.
Elon is so damn wholesome 🤣
Here for Jelon
Fuuuuuuck yah 👨🏻‍🌾🐽👍🏼
Joe calling a motor and engine... Ouch
My property in Arizona Elon?? My lawsuits?? This chip in my spine??? Rape and torture?? You do remember all this right?? I could go on and on fackkk it only lasted for 5 year's!!!
Can the guy holding the camera chew a little louder?
I can't believe this guy just tried to shoot an arrow at his guest truck! Lol hilarious. Elon pretty cool to let him tho. I bet when Elon goes home he's like damn he dented my truck 😂
I think that Musk is the coolest billionaire in the world.
Joe and Elon are like the Loki and Mobius of our universe.
ask yourself what he is doing with the boring company...
It's interesting how Elon is making bullet proof vehicles with atomic level air filters, owns a global internet company, has a rocket manufacturer, the largest social media platform, owns and has large ties to the largest AI companies, is creating brain chips with the purpose of collectivizing the entire human consciousness into a borg hivemind, has a book where he said he was made for war, all at a time where no one trusts their government...and when almost no one is in disagreement with him in the mainstream. Watch out for his eventual interventions between Palestine and Israel and remember X is an abbreviation of the name Christ in Greek and in the end of times a man will come to try and dethrone him and take over the world, leading it into ruin.
That haircut slaps, Joe.
Elon knows what's coming.
I love how this billionaire bet a millionaire 1$ 🤣
1.7 million views in 8 hrs.  gads!!!
I love Joe and Elon lol. I’d like to see a show where the two of them and Redban travel around the world together. Like Top Gear but just doing other stuff too.
Wtf is going on here 👀
"hey cutie!" 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😭🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🥰
Trucks so amazing yet theres zero manufacturered!!
Amazing how much comercial i need to listen to to hear this on Spotify even whit premium. One commercial was fine, not 2 every hour
SKIP E Lowe
I wanna know, who packs all those blunts for JRE.
Take my money
The end of the episode was disappointing, wish they had more time
I wanted to watch joe rogan instead i get greeted with he-man shooting elon musks cybertruck with a bow
For us UK people - we feel a bit uneasy seeing Jimmy Saville reincarnated.....
That wig!!!
So a moron with a bow and arrow gets together with a brilliant designer billionaire to shoot at a design truck.
holy, i'mma go watch teh full episode
Bow Rogan ain't slick
What's up with the mop Joe.  Jezze you badass
Ford: built like a rock Elon: but is it bullet proof
Elon "Hey cutie" dead 😂 Joe is getting Elon warmed up for Joey Dias one podcast 😂
Elon's laugh when the arrow didn't work.  Joe start to talk about arrow ballistics.
dude my ears 4:44
Elon used to be cool.  Joe must not have heard about the 12 healthy monkeys that died due to Elon trying to hook up Artificial intelligence.  Elon definitely not American, possibly not human.  We see you Elon.  What kind of name is that any way??✌️🇺🇸🇹🇯🇪🇦💪
Chew more gum bud
This was easily one of the most surreal things I’ve ever watched.
beauty
Joe pushing his hair to the side like 💅
Joke Incoming  The first homie in the hood with a CyberTruck is gonna fuck people up during a driveby.
Fug he is so cool
A broadhead......
Can we get get a 52 rockwell under the cyber truck? I want to haul coal on a budget
That was the most American clip I just watched 😂
Rip Worlds richest man, killed by Joe Rogan by arrow ricochet off his own truck.
So I guess that's what happens when people ultra rich just chill ahh?😂
3:39 Joe is so tiny, compared to the oil chugging truck.
Elon is pretty cool. I doubt i would want to work for him. But definitely cool to kick it with. He's like the friend that if told he can't do something. He just looks at you and says Bet!  Someone hold my beer.
Hearing Elon talk about gun stuff makes me like him so much more!
The  PUERTO RICO Roberto Clemente shirt is cool :)
Mf look like He-Man masters of the universe
Seriously with the gum chewin? God....damn.
Wonder when the first cyber cop truck will roll out.  If I was LEO I'd want a cybertruck for my patrol vehicle.
wow elon is still full of bullshit
Joe looks different - has he lost weight or something...?!
Looking forward to the Tesla crossbow.
He’s so full of shit lol
Elon is just fascinating!
That laugh at 4:05 after he calls Joe cutie is the most real I've ever heard Elon show emotion
Joe took Eddie's advice, Make wigs cool again!!!
I feel like these JRE interviews are therapeutic for Elon.
He-Man and some homeless guy talking about trucks...
Now i want a cyber truck with a turret
A billionaire and a millionaire playing games with their expensive things is so funny
Tesla stock tomorrow 📈
yeah that weight is a deal breaker. I would prefer a sub 3k pound 40 year old hilux.
this can go right under the why women live longer section in the dicitonary am i right?
Yeah that weight is a deal breaker. I'll stick with a sub 3k pound 40 year old Hilux.
Thank you Elon. Thank you Joe. This brings joy to me. You both do,  thank you.
Sorry why is JoeRogan dressed as Jimmy Savile?
👨🏻: Hey cutie 👩🏼: thank you 🥺
Elon is always game.
I feel sorry for the people not invested with Tesla period.....Tesla is literally going to revolutionize how we travel and not with just cars and trucks....
I wanna see Joe do his signature spinning back kick into the truck 😂
Trying to give a Mafia Godfather vibe, but only with an autistic way of talking. Lol
Am I the only one who thinks Joe is retarded for just shooting that arrow so casually 10ft from the truck without thinking about how dangerous the ricochet could have been?
7 years and the cyber truck isn’t out…
Elon preparing for the coming nuclear apocalypse. We gonna have some mad max trucks next year
I used to think Musk went too far by making CyberTruck’s bullet proof. Now, with the way the world’s going, I’m not so sure it’s too much anymore.
3:36 That piece flying toward the camera made me dodge.
The recurve bow would have been more powerful, still a good demonstration.
Now we can invade North Sentinel Island
When is the cyber truck coming
That laugh from elon 😂😂
Happy Halloween 👻 pumpkin 🎃 ¡
Yes Joe, it will protect you against bears
Fu@kin love you guys🤙😎🤙
I love that they paused the podcast to test this
Please  make a shooter challenge  to all makes and models  🤔😁😎
post production has the power to get rid of the dude chewing gum in the mic and didnt do it wtf
too bad whoever recorded the footage was chomping on their fucking gum through the entire clip 😑
Blondes have more fun!!! Lol
Should have had Joe sign the ding made by his arrow - hilarious!
LMAO I thought the thumbnail was clickbait with the wig!
Cameraman Chewing is cringe
Crossbow might be better in this regard.  Watch any force penetration test for crossbows vs bows.  Very light crossbows have remarkable penetration.  There are videos of crossbow bolts penetrating both the front windshield and a dummy skull for a kill shot.
What the cybertruck represents currently in the automotive industry is proof that even with all the money in the world, you just can't buy brains.
Yeah.. very cool. Now let’s do a real trick and make the dual motor under 60k!
I saw the cybertruck on Missiona st downtown San Francisco a few days ago!
I have to say, that's pretty impressive armor for a commercial vehicle, but I'm also wondering, modern cars are made to crumple to reduce the impact on the driver, so a car that's _too_ strong might be more dangerous to get in a full-stop wreck with, although, even if this thing collided with something, I'm not sure it'd stop. On another note, I'm not sure why no ones making a huge deal about the AI-driven bulletproof trucks that the technocracies of the world totally won't use in Earth: The Cyberpunk Update.
Would have liked to see that arrow in slow mo.
Plus an up armored truck or suv is crazy expensive when you could buy the cybertruck. No gas worries either. Other worries but you really gotta be someone
No matter how much money they get, they are still boys woth toys.
Lol my 1500 weighs 6,200
1.7 million views in 7 hours, roughly 1/4 million people an hour... NOT considered trending 😂
Barely scratched it… Joe missed his calling as an adjuster 😁
So is it Joelon Rogusk or Ejoe Muskgan if they combined to form a superhuman?
Impressive!   He didn't even hesitate once to say go ahead and shoot that arrow at it.  It flattened the arrow.
Remember when that one guy tried to bet Joe and they got into a b*tch fit? 😂
Love joe wearing the puerto ricsn jersey
I finally saw a Cyber Truck rollin' down the street, it looked pretty cool, it needed a good wash though. Coming at me strait on, it looked like something out of a 70s-80s sci-fi production with flying motorcycles.
Joe looks like a cousin to the assassin from no country for old men 😂
This was one of Joe’s best episodes 😂👏🏼 Elon is funny as hell too. Both are real OGs Arrow? Really??? 🤣
Is joe dressed as he man or its Ma'am? 😂
What a mind he has, genius, and then there is Elon!
Not sure if Joe is Paddy The Baddy or HeMan
that fucking chewing from the cameraman during the arrow shot is so gross!
The cameraman chewing gum drove me nuts
Zero precaution taken. Gotta love it.
Give the cyber truck to whistlendiesel he’ll be the judge of durability 🤣
"Hey cutie"  *Elon laughs as if the best joke was said*  I love this guy lol
4:03 💀
Joe should wear the wig at UFC fights just to troll his fellow commentators lol
dannng this new He-Man trailer is super cerebral
Beast Mode? I think Marshawn Lynch has that trademarked....Elon should have to pay him to use that term
*Joe-mmy Saville*  Because he looks like Jimmy savile with that barnet on his head
Elon preparing for The Purge with that truck.
I can penitrate .12 stainless with a claw hammer.
I love it how people first doubted tesla then they succeed and show the whole world who the keader is.. love it how they made fun of space X and now theyre super auccessful, people doupted reliability in tesla vehicles, theyre great and now people laugh at cybertruck.. its a trend where bunch of poor people get together to find reasons to hate on something they cant afford and are jelaous of.
1.6 MIL IN 8 HOURS IS INSANE
Right on!! I think you both are F;n awesome. Especially Elon! (sorry Joe. He's got rockets AND a type E and, and, and... :)  I love the spontaneous decision to F'n do it NOW !!
My guy on the camera chewing gum right in the mic 🤢🤮
Hows that a truck though? You couldnt carry anything like you csn with a normal truck
What about if you shoot it
Is this what it's like being high all the time?
every person with a certain amount of money or power should smoke weed everyday
i thought for sure that arrow was going through that
Yeah but how does it go if your girlfriend shits in it ??? 🤔
So… are you marketing to cryps or bloods. Or maybe cartels 😂
Joes got the best since of humor dressing up like that picture 😂
We need a Cybertruck with all the crazies on the road these days!
Looks like Elon wouldn't talk shit if Jeo didn't had the blonde wig...😂😂😂😂 Elon ahead of his game 🎯
The thing looks like a real life game glitch 😂
i can't take this seriously . come on , Joe is like supper duper serious at 0:28 with that wig . hahaha come on hahahaha
What’s up with the hair Joe
Ok….. that’s freaking impressive wow!1
This was so epic!
Joe looks like Paddy the Baddy!
What’s the exterior made of ?
cartel cant wait to get one lol
Elon is the most down to earth billionaire.
Does Elon really believe that he’s bringing good things to the world and society, while doing the exact opposite!!!
This interview was an embarrassment. 3 hours with Elon and most of it was joe eating and small talking about shitty sushi you can only get if you’re rich. It was pathetic
Hahahahahahahaha!  This blonde wig is so funny!!!
joe looking like an asian mother
“Beware of ricochets” followed by a broad head arrow tip flying directly at the camera man lol
Go went from button up first formal interview to Susan in the self checkout line. Love it
Joe Rogaine
The material development is good the design is still hideous lol.
Where's Joe and when did he man show up?
The idiot chewing gum in our ears is just ewwwwww.
Cyber truck still on eh? Sorry tossed my reserve. Itll be fun to see them on the road.
How man do you have to be to ask Elon Musk if you can shoot his truck with your bow and arrow and Elon says, "ya wanna do it right now?"
Representing the blonde PR Team!! Love It
Team Rubio!!! Let's go!
This is stupid. Joe’s ridiculous. It weighs so freakin much cause all the green earth batteries. Sheep
Elon is the antichrist
Elon Musk has built his success on the concept of fucking around and finding out. Guy is a maniac  😎 🖕😎🖕 <— Elon
Love Elon!
I knew Joe go both ways.Sometimes as you get older you come out of the closet.
You don't have any guns to shoot it with??? cmon Joe!
Boy Elon thinking about that dent lol
....but the gum chomper
3:36 Just love Elon's billionaire laugh at the back,while Joe shoots a fucking arrow at his one-off build truck.
Joe trying to teach Elon about crossbows. Elon - "Well I think the thing that matters is the unit per energy area..." Joe - WTF did I just walk into?
As a Puerto Rican— Joe we fux wit u, love the jersey 🇵🇷
Whoever is holding the camera while chewing gum when he is shooting the bow - hearing you chew was unpleasant enough to stop watching.
I love Elon took his drink into garage. My kinda guy
It's funny how u same clowns trash people  u hate that put on wigs but now u all 🤐
The camera man needs to stop munching on something.   That audio is grating
but if you aim it at the window?
Joe lost a dollar to Elon lmfao!!! I’m so happy I’m alive for this
Elon: We used a Tommy gun   Joe: I bet I can shoot an arrow through it.
That was the most masculine conversation I've ever witnessed.
I can hear liberals crying over on reddit just from watching this
"dug our own grave with the Cybertruck". Finally an honest moment from the fraudster.
joe looking old AF
Ifiiffif
The best add money can't buy
Elon should've dressed up as Grand Admiral Thrawn ;)
whose chomping gum
That’s insane
Love watching this gen x convo lol
Joe is a trip. Would love to hang out with him. With that wig, he reminds me of Joe Walsh lol
Joe almost pulled a steve irwin but with an arrow instead of a stingray. Sketch level 💯. These two are awesome🇺🇸
Dammit! I think Elon and Joe just sold me a Cybertruck based on it being bulletproof alone.
thought the title was a metaphor
WOW! I would tell you to watch the whole episode, but id advise skipping over the part were they eat pizza together! Joe smacking his mouth wide open and talking with pizza falling out his mouth!! I know, f__k my opinion. But i guess i just assumed he had a little more class😂
Elon fine af
Well lets find out....confident comeback
Wepa Joe I love the Jersey VIVA PUERTO RICO PAPA 🇵🇷🇵🇷
whistlin diesel enters chat*
Is Joe Ellen for Halloween?
"Hey cutie" 😂😂 lmaoo
"I can shoot my arrow into your truck" "betcha can't" "wanna try" "ok" lol awesome
Girls this is a lesson as to why men get along and dominate industries.   Sorry
I’ll bet you a dollar says the man who who has all the money in the world lol
Joe shooting a cyber truck, Elon watching, ripped navy seal security in the background, Jaime chewing gum, what else can you ask for
Joe roagan  is team rubio 🇵🇷 how i can not love this man ❤
Elon Luther👎😂
is he he man?
He-Man and Dr. Strange in this bitch!
joe rogan shooting a cybertruck with a bow is basically real life horizon zero dawn
Don't think they can afford to fix that dent.
Who is this hot girl??
Did it stop a slug or birdshot? Cause if it stopped a slug that is crazy.
100 percent you couldn’t shoot that same bow setup into a regular f150 or any ford or Chevy truck for that matter. Common sense should tell you if it’s bulletproof it’s definitely arrow proof… I’m hoping Joe just wanted to shoot the truck for fun….
I love how happy Elon Musk is around Joe Rogan.
Yeah... looks like I'm getting a Cybertruck. The truck that's built for America's AR-15s. LOL!
Elon did the math and he knows it isn’t as much energy as the firearms.
Joe has hair 😅
Doris Day?
Joe's wearing a Trans-wig??? What's kid rock got to say???🤣
Is Joe dressed as He-Man for Halloween?
Man I'd give anything to smoke a cigar and talk to these guys
Cyber truck sales about to skyrocket
Bruh are Elon and Joe becoming like actual friends?
Joe in that wig looks like a combination of a 80s wrestler and a Dr. Who character
I need to keep my bow in my rig. Iranian apocalypse
Elon and Joe for prez and VP!!
Joe, just sold a shit ton of cyber trucks
Can you imagine it ricochet right into Elon…
If you have issues with roided up indians shooting arrows at your car the cyber truck is the car for you.
Speed is what beats armor tho Mr Rogan...
Notice the Puerto Rico shirt on Joe? Big ups to Joe for showing love to the island
the cartel just got a new truck
Waiting for the pingtrip version of this
"now we know" lmao :D
I predict that clip of Elon laughing when they got back into the studio will make a legendary meme. 👌
So first off, the 83’ G series the A-Tema had was no ordinary 200 Hp steel framed van. It was obviously bulletproof, and indestructible 😂  Now, that Truck being the same quality build, that 0-60 is impressive for the weight 💪 And I know Elon delivers
0.25x speed
What's joe wearing lol 🤣🤣🤣
Joe "I wonder if it'd stop an arrow..." Elon " We haven't tried that. We should try that. Let's go try that."
Usually when a thumbnail reads like that, for an interview, it’s a metaphor way, or of saying that the interviewer is ‘ poking fun’ or calling out design flaws, something negative. With Joe Rogan, it is precisely as it says, and literally there’s no other way to say it. 😂😂😂
Whoevers recoridng couldnt stop chewing gum for 30 seconds?
Damn. That truck is a beast. Elon was too confident that arrow wont penetrate his truck even with that close distance. Damn!
THIS IS AMAZING!
Joe must be drinking Bud Light again  🤣.
He draws an 80lb compound bow seemingly effortlessly
Dang!!! To bullet proof a vehicle  that isn't that way from the factory can cost easily $50K+ (depending on your definition of bulletproof). Many folks pay upwards of that for elite packages. And the cyber truck is that way FROM THE FACTORY! Elon is even smarter than I knew, and I already gave him a ton of credit. That's a use case Noone saw coming.
I swear that truck looks like a double-ended stainless steel stove... I'm expecting a turkey dinner to come out the back side.
Thanks fir the wig JR!!! looks good on u buddy 🇺🇸💰🥩
Wonder if Joe's wearing the girls wig as a sign in the illuminati
Joe, you are loosing my respect. You need to start asking some tough questions to this pathological liar. Just from the top of my head "What connections does he have in government and elite circles that kept his stolen company alive for decades through subsidiaries and who is allowing him to use non-consenting real pedestrians as his gene-pigs for his self-driving experiments?"  There are a lot of questions I'd like to see him get asked just so that I can watch him mumble through in discomfort.
This was so good on so many levels...i loved it!😂😂😂😂😂
All Eyes On Me
No way thats all that happened. Extremely impressive.
What a weird little guy.
He-man definitely knows how to interview Elon Musk.
I bet if Joe had a stick of dynamite, Elon would say go ahead. Test this baby!!!
the size and weight of the bolt vs the arrow is not relevant unless they are both going the same velocity. A Crossbow can hit 450FPS. The Momentum (not force) is Mass times Velocity. (Force would be Mass times acceleration and that would measure how much force was applied to the projectile, but I am more interested in the moment each has After it reaches it's peak velocity and then hits the cybertruck)   Joe says his Arrow is  520 grains @ 300FPS. A Crossbow bolt is anywhere from 400 to 450, and will do up to 450 FPS.  So without bothering to convert anything... Joes arrow will have momentum of 300 * 520 which is 156,000 of...some unit.  Elons Crossbow would have momentum of 450 * 450 which is 202,500  or like 23% more of whatever the heck this unit of measure is.  Thus the bolt will impart a greater impact to the cybertruck.   Now here's what most amuses me about all this. You can SEE on Elons face, he's doing the math in his head on this, and simply CHOOSES not to Correct Joe on 6th grade equations on his own show.  Classy.
This is quality content.
joe trying to calculate physics, while elon is like yeah i don't fucking know either man, i just copy paste what my engineers tell me
These two would make the best Y2K odd couple. The shit they would do if they roomed together for one year!
So, uh. we just shot an arrow. into it. And it barely scratched it. barely scratched it.  It was probably moving two hundred and seventy five feet a second. 🧠 🖥  that was a  five hundred twenty five, grainish arrow.... ya even more than that ! It had 125 grain head so that was 545 grains thats impressive... That just destroyed the broadhead the broadhead flattened at the tip. And then the arrow blew apart.   Amazing.
Wonder how much that dent cost to repair/replace.    Who can not love him saying sure, shoot it? Better than that steel ball was it, that smashed the glass....right?
@5 min, no joe it is not for fun, these are robots that can navigate across the country with out an operator.  they are impenetrable war machines.  elon has built skynet, opps i mean star link.  and autonomous vehicles that of coarse could never be weaponized.   robots that can self dock at charging stations, just think about that.
richest man in the world.
great stuff thank you both
That's actually impressive. But, that is thee ugliest vehicle ever! Soo stupid lookin!
What if I’m shooting with a Ak47?
If you wore the wig while shooting, it would of probably worked 😃
Two legends having a good time
I bet Alex is pissy cuz he wasn't brought up during the Twitter talk.
Once they get in the garage all I can hear is the jackhole chewing gum loudly into the camera mic
Let me get this right, you shot an arrow designed to slice through flesh at a metal vehicle and it bounced off. To be honest it probably would have put a hole in my Tundra so I'm impressed.
Well that was entertaining
Elon 😂😂😂 awesome
This is some serious rich people shit
Elon is cool as fuck
Is he wearing a He-Man wig? Elon should have worn his Skeletor hood
"And now we know"         ~Joe Rogan
Barely scratched it but it put a nice little quarter size dent on it😂😂😂 fu🎉ck Elon , going with that fear propaganda mobile 4:26 😢 and even Elon the Draco reptilian ought to know that nothing but benevolence is coming, and the Galactic Federation of worlds , and the Galactic Federation of Light are here for Elon and all of his Draco reptilian brothers and sisters all the other negative entity aliens like the Orion race the negative grey aliens , that Mark Zuckerberg is , for I see LIGHT that no one sees😊❤❤❤
Joe Rogan looks like Heman
i would be impressed by the bulletproofness if it looked like a truck and not some 8 bit 90s video game monstrosity
Andrew inspired them with the cigars
Joe Rogaine*
Awesome podcast! You guys freaking hilarious. It's been 8 hours since I watched it, and I'm still laughing. We are blessed to have you guys. Thank you!
Am I the only one wondering what bet joe lost to have to wear that wig
This is one of those " Most American " things ever 😂😂
Jesus... 90lbs pull on that? Joe's a lil' beast. 😄
Joe has to wear that wig if he's interviewing paddy after a fight😂😂😂
What quiver was that on Joe’s bow?? Crazy
How much does this truck go for ?
Staged arrow to increase the stock price
is it just me or has Elon progressively become more normal and less awkward
Is it me or does Joe look like He Man?
Joe love your stuff. But you have know idea of anything between bows and crossbows lol. If a crossbow won't then your bow wont.
Fuckng awesome.
Konnesigg has a gas powered car that goes 0-100 in 2 seconds.
Yo LOL THIS IS SOOO SICK!!!!
I want a co. with that tool to assiste me :0
ROGAN….. what have you done …… UGHHHHHHH !!!!!!  JUST WHY ? EXPLAIN !!!  WHYYY!! Bro 🫡
why didn't you try the windows with the arrow?
damn, joe rogan looking like he-man!
Some excellent advertising there! 😂
"beast mode" 😂 i bet musk played altered beast as a kid 😂😂😂
Does Joe's studio smell like a casino or what lol
He should've kept that wig on when he shot the arrow!
joes looking rough
Ask him why he doesnt invest in hydrogen powered vehicles, less expensive and zero effects on the environment compared to the production of elec vehicles that run out of juice fast, and wreck the evnt, and useless in the event of a power outage
joe hoegan harkey lama
i dont understand how Joe thinks his bow is stronger than a 9mm, he said himself his arrow travels at 300-400 FPS and he is also a firearm enthusiast so he has to know that 9mm travels at 1200- 1400 FPS
the only time the camera ever left the studio lol
full podcast??
Shows how little he knows about arrows , that's a hunting flesh type arrow with a light , sharp tip on it ... Of course it would just bend and break .
Everyone thinking Rogan is just being silly are missing that the zog is putting him through the typical humiliation ritual.
It's got to be the ugliest truck ever. But I could tolerate all of that if only it were painted. I recall hearing a similar problem with the DeLorean; it's body repair options were limited due to the polished steel design.
I like comics but these are the kind of guests that are WAY WAY WAY more interesting!
Elon is the dumbest person alive. Talks like he knows the details, but has no idea. I'll sell you a roadster, promise me money, when is it going to go into production, well, its, turboencabulation is hard.
Give the man his $1
Don’t matter if you’re a podcast icon or a billionaire, boys will be boys. “You want to shoot an arrow at a truck?” 🤣
We need to see Elon and Joe making some more crazy "garage" bets
We need Joe to wear a wig while interviewing Donald trump 😂
Why do Teslas give me motion sickness?  I disabled the automatic braking and it still makes me want to vomit. Anyone else???
That face with blonde hair 🤣
I ❤ elon.
In the Top Gear special where they drove through Iraq, they had their security guy shoot 1 handgun round into the passenger door of a Mazda. It turned into 3 fragments exiting the driver door.
Only way off this planet is through Jesus Christ ❤❤❤
Elon and Joe need a show together where they do one episode every other month
Is joe supposed to be dressed as he man or timothy Treadwell. I can't tell
bald legolas attempts to slay a transformer with an arrow
Look at these fucking bosses
I don’t care about any performance numbers when it’s that ugly…
Here it comes, MAD MAX
Team rubio 🇵🇷🏆
🗣 Aye somebody tell ha I said she’s a nice lady!
Dude I’m impressed with how fast Elon and Rogan smashed that pizza. I counted like 4 pieces each in 3 minutes bro. 😂
Elon seeks like such a real guy, such a funny personality
E = 1/2 mv^2
That's pretty damn kool ain't gonna lie.
damn the camera man likes his gum stop chewing like a animal
Joe “Goddamn Fucking Shit, it’s totally legit, bro!” Rogan
I love his costume of his doppelganger😂
This the 1st time ever I seen his episode.. went out of the studio and do cool shit..✌😎  not mention he is the only person who can ask a billionaire if he can shoot his truck without any hesitation..  The good thing about this video is you see that truck ain't no bullshit..🙌🙌🙌  And joe is the best interviewer hands down..🙌🙌 spontaneous.. and just being real..😎
Elon is such a cool dude
Too bad the cyber truck doesn't have the utility of an actual truck.
Elons mouth sounds on this clip are next level
The Cybertruck is as much of a failure as Musk himself.
I’ll bet you a dollar 😂😂
Love the costume Joe! Lmao😂
A pointy field point would have a better chance than a broad head, broad heads are sharp but too brittle. If that arrow was 545 grains going 275 fps that's about 91 ft/lbs of energy, compared to 400ish ft/lbs with a 9mm.
Yes, this is the source of all my news and current events and yes, I trust him wholeheartedly
That was a pretty awesome cut to and back again....like they never even left the studio. except joe got hammered haha
The rich person laugh that Jim Carrey talked about holds true
EV is an absolute con job on humanity
Elon about to sell those trucks to the military.
THIS is why I love Elon
Built Tesla Tough
Imagine having witnessed a tesla accident in person.................. someone over speeded (probably in ludacris mode), and lost control, hit a lamp post in front of my work............... The car BURST into flames within 10 seconds of hitting the pole. By burst into flames, I mean the flames were 10 ft high in the air.   It took 3 fire trucks to put out the tesla.   They would extunguish the fire, and then it would re ignite and burst into flames again....... and again........ and again. ... Meanwhile the car has bullet proof glass, has lost all power, even aux power........ and there are people trapped in the car, one of which died on impact......... I watched multiple people try to hit the windows with objects to try and break them to get the occupants out of the car.  NOBODY was able to break the windows to get to those people and save them.  The fire department has to CUTthe top of the car off at the metal.  By the time they were able to cut the top of the car off and remove it, both of the occupants of the car were dead.  One dead on impact, and one dead because of the fire.    This happened in south tacoma last year, right in front of my work............ Peoeple tried to help the driver of the car out who was still alive, but nobody could, and he died because of the bulletproof glass, and the explosive batteries.    DO NOT EVER drive a tesla. DO NOT EVER buy a tesla.
I fucking love these 2 together
Id love to see what king offroad racing shocks and elon musk (tesla)could do ....bet they could make some silent killers ...FOR MILITARY USE ONLY
This is the best interview I’ve seen in a while
i didn't see him give elon that dollar. elon is a bad ass nerd boy. he seems cool to hang with. he's right. trucks are supposed to be tough and manly.... i still don't like the style though....
I'm wondering, on the slim chance his cybertruck takes off and is not a complete failure. How long until someone uses one to commit a crime and go on a shootout. You basically have a criminal with an armored car. Can you imagine that car chase? Quick legislation would ensue.
Man. Joe really asks the questions we really want to know and Elon always delivers. Two demigods in their own respective fields   making magic. Because of Joe..I will buy a cybertruck. Because of Elon, so will my grandchildren.
Joe shooter ninety pound pull bow
Neolithic Joe Rogan trying to hunt a cyber truck
Is this a.i? 😂 Why is Joe wearing that?
It would be a shame if you brought Ballistic High-Speed out and captured that in slo-mo. Real shame.
Cool but totally they used the wrong head.
Great promotional video! Now rich Cali folks can buy it, and be safe from street robbers.
You guys are badass what about the glass my guy
I do have to wonder, if the cyber truck is this tough, what happens to the passengers during a car crash? If the vehicle is like a steel safe, wouldn’t the people inside absorb all of the impact force?
All police should have this truck ASAP
Elon is a fantastic person if y’all get to know him.
my crossbow is 415fps 😂
Paddy the baddy Rogan
Yo you guys are to smart to do that kind of dumb stuff you could have got hurt or worse.
Men being men...😊 imagine  that
Isn't this the flash gitz team?
Field point would have stood a better chance vs metal
Tesla needs to advertise!!!!  17 M views on @X 1.5 M views on YouTube Can't see how many on Spotify.  Great interview, broad topics, interesting topics, some silly topics. Great all around interview.
the man is the batman! :)
You can tell Joe has been hanging out with Shane and Matt the way he went “whoah”
Who’s that broad? -Frank Reynolds
Joe changing gender? Stay a man!!
What a cool scene lol elon just laughing two mates having a little kids bet as grown men cowboys and indians style Lol
Like dressed up 🫡
ima need that truck to take a .50 bmg joe
It's sad to see Joe's handlers make him wear a wig to fit in by today's, so called standard's.
Cops   "step out of the vehicle or we will get you out "   Elon  "He he he bet you a dollar ".
KE = 1/2 MV^2  What that means is you double the mass you double the impact.  You double the velocity you quadruple the impact.  Therefore, IF higher speed costs less than more mass, choose higher speed projectiles.
I thought it was edited lmao
"well now we know"🤣
Elon is my kinda friend
I didn’t see what happened because piece of the broadhead hit me in the eye
these two are great
Weird seeing Mr.Joe not sitting down. Didn't realize he had legs.
You dented his door for a stupid reason lol.
That’s such an amazing costume
When it comes to rich people, these two are the best.
i don't get the comment musk said about "if you shoot a car with a gun it's going to go through both doors". that's just not even true. if you hit a car at an angle with a gun it's likely not going to go through "both doors" and a lot of times head on won't even do it. i've shot at junkers before (one's made after mid 2000's....) and I've watched a ton of shoot out vids with rifle rounds going 30-50 yards into police cars and there's really not significant penetration, the bullet gets torn up and explodes into a bunch of pieces by time it gets to the back of the vehicle. there's even vids where the back hatch is completely open of K9 units and they are openly standing behind it, taking round after round, and the bullets are just breaking up. maybe most of these are all hollow point bullets? yeah, if you put a full slug through something it's gonna blast through it though.
Finally, my fear of being attacked by an archer has been alleviated
camera man during the arrow part chewing gum into the mic should be fired fuck that guy i hate him now
Elon Musk also gets no penetrations. I have proof.
Cyber Truck aka Mini Tank.
If you handle Tesla and Space X, you could be President on the fly and at least you don't get lost, make up words or smell kid's hair!
that truck is huge
I enjoy Elon’s cadence it’s calming 😆
How tf joe got the exact same Puerto Rico jersey I was rocking in high school?😂
did Joe lose a bet or what??
The new hair makes Joe Rogaine looks 50 years younger 😍 .such overwhelming handsomeness, california is no longer in a drought the moisture in the girl's underwear has gone up 1,000,000 percent thanks to Professor Rogaine.
He-man talking to 10,000 year old vampire about beast modes is crazy.
I was worried Joe would get hit!
The End of the most prolific  Podcast  Joe was the man but now he just a sellout
The cybertruck was made for an era of looters, mobs, driving through danger...
Elons might seem like a genius but he’s basically just designed a new style of tank that nobody can penetrate…… if it were anymore dumb I’d have to start watering it two times a day. Cheers you total bellend.
I love that Joe dressed up like the dude who looked like him at a baseball game
Thats impressive for sure
God I fuqing love Joe Rogan 😅
He lives in Boca Chica Texas right on the border of Mexico. That's why he has a bullet proof truck. Lots of Cartel people all over the Brownsville Texas area.
I like Elon but this electric car business, especially as trucks are no good. I wouldn't want to go out in the bush with a 7,000 pound 4X4 with aa massive electric battery hanging underneath it
Damn not even an Arrow can penetrate a Cyber Truck 😂 you know this is like the best advertisement.
Puerto Rico 🔥🔥🔥
the gum chewing in the background is driving me nuts lol
@4:03 good luck sleeping, ever
elon laughs like Dr.Evil
most car doors wont stop Penetration of 9mm FMJ, the bullet will get Lost inside the car Door / or poking out the Interior side.  you can Easily UP armor the windows by adding Tough 3M Ballistic film .(can still Roll down windows). you can take Cybertruck to an Armorer , to replace  side Windows w/ Ballistic Laminate , but loose ability to Roll down windows.  would also make Sense to Replace Interior surfaces w/ KEVLAR blankets. to Reduce penetrations.
how many double pineapple double anchovy pizzas were ordered tonight?
You're going to need that to truck to survive the City. But the number of terrorists in country are enormous. We have many enemies and for Biden to actively remove all protections at the border while Dems cheered them on is disgusting. They were cheering for their demise!
Cybertruck 😂😂😂 what a joke
Would it stop a 50 Cal?
Btw, this is why MEN rule!..... These guys are literally making solud , mathematical arguments, but sound like 8 year old boys.
That was so cool of Elon to let Joe shoot his Truck!
Why is joe looking like Jimmy saville
Hey Cutie 😉
Joe wins costume of the year
love everything about this hahah
Happy Halloween  Bitches
Looks like Joe is the only one to put a dent in the truck.  Atleast the passenger side.
joe lookin like a wide beast
Bruh... Elon Musk is a Bond Villain with a good heart.
he-man !?
Is the window bullet proof as well? Because that would be bring it to an entirely new level...
Hey cutie 😂
This is the coooooolest shit ever !!!!!!!
Joe and Elon from flash glitz is a great reflection of the friendship I think these guys will have
am i the only one thinking whos gonna pay for that dent on that expensive car!? 😂
Damn joe...you lucky bastard.
😮🤯 Bink*
Looks like the perfect anti protester vehicle, lol
Joe is the modern HE MAN😝👍🏻
Elon is so dirty. I absolutely despise him
He said I’ll bet you a dollar 😂 dude seems cool
Billionaire: "Sure, you can try to shoot a hole in my One Off stainless steel truck." Millionaire: "Cool, I happen to have a compound bow on me." These two together are CLASSIC! What a great podcast! The highlight of my day😂😂😂
Elon musk “ya I’ll bet you a dollar” I am done 😂😂😂😂
Joe dressing up as the meme of him is effin golden!!!!!
I want to reach the level of this, whenever my dudes ask can I shoot your cyber truck with arrow I'll be able laughing in fun and allow them to...
Robin Hood prince of weed.
Joe Rogan is his sense of reality
If tesla made a real life 4x4 warthog like from halo, i would do anything to buy one. Like ANYTHING. Like…butt stuff.
Water does stop bullets.  It shreds them.  So, jump into water it's deep enough to escape bullet fire.      o
tough truck Elon, now you need a hydrogen gas ICE powered version
Wow, much less damage than I would have expected
Joe brings in the boss of bosses 🙌 ❤
That spark was crazy, I thought the arrow tip shattered.
FOCUS idiot camera guy...pff
I’d like to see green tip 556s
Elon laughs in wealth.
Elon getting us ready for the boogaloo.
Some Jimmy Seville vibes
Yo??
Need an 8 ft bed version.
I’ve never used a bow and arrow but it doesn’t make any sense. Joe is shooting it from 1012 feet away and he is at a angle but once it hits the cyber truck it’s just falls on the floor you would think the arrow would impact and fly towards Elon
Joe looks completely wasted
Joe's a legend 😂
another reason to waste my money on this amazing product
Joe looks like and old Aussie surfer dude in the blonde wig.
The difference between science and f**king around is that in science somebody is writing it down.
Can’t wait for Flashgitz to make a video about this.
Joe looks like E.T.
Why do you need a bullet proof truck?
Watch Elon throw a ping pong ball at it and cave the door in.
minute 4:07 Joe lost a bet.
"Built Ford Tough" doesn't hold much weight anymore 😂😂
every time the camera quickly panned from Elon to Joe and then back to Elon it made me laugh lmao. That quick glimpse of Rogan wearing that outfit is hilarious.
Joe looks like MP Michael Fabricant wearing that syrup!!
90 lbs for a bow is pretty crazy. My noodle arms get tired after a day at 65 lbs lol
Joe "thats impressive" Elon "yeah"
Pingtr1p is on the case!
Joe is giving me He-Man vibes with the hair 😂
Shot an arrow, caught it on a Nokia 7650.
I love Joe's costume
baseketball
Will 556/223 75grains at 3000fps penetrate the tesla truck?
The truck is impressive I'm sure, but it is ugly as Sin
Other than the toys they bring, these are the conversations and antics I deal with with my funny brainiac sons and daughter.
The best
JOE YOU LOOK LIKE HE-MAN!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
damn  joe looked old
Just awesome
I guess boys will be boys XD. I love this shit!
who the fuck is the camera guy? just smacking that gum right into the mic
elon musks last words before the arrow was fired were "beware of ricochets" with a slight laugh 😂 legend
CYBERTRUCK POLICE CARS
Elon died today. He was hit by an arrow ricocheted off a CyberTruck.
Rogan Musk 2024
What the hell is he wearing 😂😂😂😂 I'm done with this guy bro..
Imagine being so rich u just let ur buddy shoot ur truck with a bow just to see what would happen
aim for the window
I can't deal with Joe acting normal having a straight convo while wearing that 😂😂😂
A top moment in JRE history is this!!!
"The Cybertruck" because there's only one of them
Who else wanted to be the one with the bow ha
Unless you need this for security reasons, it is just weight for no reason. Anyone can clad a vehicle in plate. It's so stupid.
Here we go with the patented Musk lying train "sub 3 second" 0-60. Full of BS as usual.
Imagine being either one of these men.. true legends 🙌
Joe for president!
Amazing shirt 🇵🇷 ❤
Can we have j leno[behind a bullet proof screen], re-enacting bonny and Clyde? Shooting up a Cybertruck? It looks like there will be another 2 million orders for Cybertruck. It will be a "Must have, gotta have" cool item like the first steve job fones. Army, police, municipal police, hunters, rednecks, farmers, company directors, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Joe Biden. Donald trump. Hollywood people needing protection, cool dudes.
so wholesome .. seeing 2 great minds , having a blast.   *RESPECT*
That spark made me jump a little.
I’ll bet you a dollar 😆
What budget of He-man is Joe?
Love it,smart
I'm glad to know that Elon, despite being one of the richest men in the world, still dresses like a college freshman on Saturday morning. Something comforting about that.
seems kinda scripted.
Haven't watched Joe's podcast in a while. I random clicked on this and Joe is now going transgender?  WTF is going on?
The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth to a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord your God. Deuteronomy 22:5  Not sure if that is a woman's wig or not, sure does look like it. But either I figured y'all could be edified by this.  Halloween is pagan and has nothing to do with the Christian religion. It is demonic. Be set apart, be holy, even as God is Holy. God bless you. 😊
An idiot and a con man,  I will  leave it up to you to decide which is which.
"I'll bet you for a dollar" that's how smart this man is. He could flip a coin for Joe's net worth but the bet is always a single dollar.  Any substantial bet is always for donations to charity. Another tax write off.
Is that a Roberto Clemente Puerto Rican Nat'l team jersey?? That's so sick
Selling these, I'd be the number one car salesman in the hood. 😭🤣😂
Ahahhaah. Trucks are supposed to be tough right! Well YEAH
It's he man
they got him , This is his Humiliation Ritual
its so funny people who think hes not smart af
While cool, tommy guns shoot .45 acp, which is devastating to non armored targets, but has little penetration capabilities, I think we need piercing rounds such as 5.56, 7.62x39/54r, etc. and see how long it lasts. Not only that, but the ammo itself should also be armor piercing. Unless it is, it'll be just as ineffective as the .45 acp/tommy gun.
The fact that the richest man on earth is casually sitting with Joe while he's wearing the wig and outfit definitely shows us we're in a different time lol  😂 the simulation can't keep up hahah
Ship my truck already https://youtu.be/SNmNpFZMfUc?si=nDBm1OCnwCo9T1n6
If I see rednecks driving Tesla vehicles, I will laugh my a$$ off. Simply contrary.
can't any car stop an arrow?
Wearing a Puerto Rico shirt with a blonde wig. Joe Rogan transcended his own meme!👏😂
Ya that was dangerous as fuck...
Elon is such a down to earth big kid just like joe I could watch these guys for days the shit they talk about blows my mind
Lmfao he did the outfit perfect .
Seems neither of they have understood the F=½M.V² . The difference between the 2 are about 14 joules.. on the order of around 1.4kg. the arrow being the higher value.. but as the arrow is usually a thinner profile, unlike the deformable bullet propper. My money was on the crossbow
SPARKS!
So what Elon is saying is that if you crash into another car whilst driving your cyber truck just know that that the little family in that car are all dead, more than dead
Epic
Cutie
2:54 well that was unexpected!! 😂🏹
This is awesome 😂 elon must LOVE cutting loose
That was the best ever
whos that mf chewing gum in our ears
I have a crossbow that is 220lb draw and moves at 415fps with a 20in bolt. Leme try!
These Cybertrucks will sell like hotcakes 🥞
The hair is hilarious 😆
Bro the cybertruck is fucking huge I never realized that
These Cybertrucks will sell like hotcakes 🥞
These Cybertrucks will sell like hotcakes 🥞
From that bow and arrow demonstration, I figured out that Joe Rogan is dressed up as a KNUCKLEHEAD! 😂
What joe gets wrong here is its all about velocity. But what helps him is the fact he has a razor sharp tip compared to a bolt. At a certain point mass doesn't matter.
Hi cutie 😂😂😂 Musk a fool 😂😂😂
This is the biggest dude convo I’ve ever heard.
Straight up.. That’s pretty sick.  Props to Elon and everything he’s accomplished. Dude pushes himself and others to the max and gets shit done.. If we do get off this planet and in to deep space, his name will be behind it.  Elon has to be pretty stoked knowing his name will always be remembered.
Just amazing interview  Thanks Elon and Joe 👍 Love these
“Hey Cutie” after the demonstration made me laugh here 😂
That’s dope. Thank you for that because we could certainly benefit from things like bulletproof vehicles here in New Orleans. I’m not exactly sold on the truck but i feel like more vehicles should offer this feature, by request -at the very least. It could potentially improve the crash test ratings for whichever vehicles that implement it i would imagine…
Elon cant turn down free advertisement.
Elon is brilliant.
Gee, tesla stock has been lagging Let's see if we can do something about that. Maybe if we shoot an arrow into the cyber truck it'll show how tough it is.  Let's do a Silverado and F-150 for comparison.
guys the year 2054 might mean something  maybe a bunch of blonde joe rogans just start pulling up in cyber trucks tryna kill all of us
Who is lame enough to smoke cigars these days? Or ever?
Gentlemen doing gentlemen things.
Elon’s interpersonal skills have grown so much since his first appearance. He could barely have a conversation then.
If only Joe knew who Jimmy savile was 😂😂
Wait... He's dressed up as Cerso Yeet?! 596 represent!
Now we just have to take it to North Sentinel Island and see if the natives can penetrate it
The non-schalont awkwardness at the begining reminded me of space ghost.
what fools using a hunting tip...try a bodkin head
rip crumple zone
I can see cops wanting bulletproof trucks but I don't think the batteries are good enough for the police, yet.
I love these guys. Makin the internet great again. Bring back this kind of content, everything's gone to hell and it's all just too much now. This kind of thing is what the internet is made for.
A billionaire just said “let’s bet a dollar on it” 😂
Jamie was absolutely chompin on some gum while filming that lmao
A multi billionaire offering to bet a multi millionaire $1 he can’t shoot an arrow through his truck.
It needs to have a bodkin arrowhead.
I’m guessing they mostly hide to make it harder to target them? (Behind cars in movies)
Joe: I bet I can get in there.   Elon: Okay I'll bet you cant Joe: Really?     Elon: Yeah I'll bet you a dollar. Billionaire humor.
Gangs be jacking Tesla trucks now
Any steel panel would stop an arrow, not sure what’s so impressive
This is siccccck
Hey Cutie! Thanks! 🤣🤣🤣
An arrow won't pierce a Ford focus either lol ....
what is Joe wearing?
If only they showed the many recalls Tesla is getting and sued for the deaths Elon musks cars have caused due to his misinformation. He doesn’t pay his employees and is being sued by them and those he hasn’t paid!
Use a field point i bet it goes thru
Goals....billionaire and millionaire just chillin "shooting the shit"
Elons laughter when the arrow bounces off.. so funny
6K comments in 6 hours! wow
That truck will be worth so much more one day if they don’t fix the dent
It's nice of Elon to introduce us to his native Martian technology
So are you assertive enough to walk into their new unisex bathroom and dawgcheck these men! 😎
Wheres my dollar Joe don't make me send the boys round.... Elon 🤣🤣
is the cameraman chewing gum
Can’t believe joe is dressed as Paddy Pimblett for Halloween
I wish we could have monthly episodes of joe and Elon. Where they catch up and relax and chat about what they’ve been up to and thoughts and ideas. How cool would that be. Everyone would watch it. I know joe would definitely be down.
“Hey cutie”😂😂
Welp guess who’s stocks I’m buying
I wonder how the tough body will factor into collision safety. It’s my understanding that cars are typically designed with softer bodies so that they can be crushed on collision and absorb some of the impact before it reaches the driver.
Joes the type of guy that actually would have a whopping great compound bow just hanging on the coat rack in his office 😂
Joe dressed up as Team Rubio 😂🇵🇷
that truck is so ugly
He's built an armoured buggout vehicle for civilians.
LMAO richest man in the world: I'll bet you a dollar :D
Good podcasts dropped this Halloween. This and Theo and Tucker🔥🔥
Chicago survival proof pickup truck
Thats a hell of a garage
What the heck happens if one of these trucks gets into an accident though? It just obliterates the other car? It's like when one of those amphibious military vehicles hit that city bus.
With the amount of shooting which happen in america, i can see this car becoming insanely popular among over protective mothers.
The sparks flying was crazy,   It made me laugh before it entirely,  Some dude has built a truck before from ground up like Elon, and claimed it was bulletproof, and his buddy next to him said you think it’ll stop my bow ?   And this shit happened   The only difference, that dude would ruin his worst tip for it, and it would go through,
Just wait till Andrew Camerata gets his
The full podcast is one of my favourites ever . This was so much fun . Not to serious every informative and all kinds funny
This feels like an ai episode
They should be best friend's
His body guards with one hand on the holster
who gives a sh!t about a truck thats gonna burn down a building... lame commercial just pump hid dodgecoin shillers already....
Awesome
This is the best internet experience I have ever had, lol. He should have shot it while wearing the Rick Flair hair...
Will someone with bow/arrow knowledge please explain the actual magnitude of what those numbers mean? Like, to me (as someone who knows nothing about bows and arrows) this was prety impressive. I wonder what it all means compared to different bullet types. 🤔
I wonder how many drug dealers will buy that car
😮
Good team! Great buzz and wig Joe That car is crazzzzy
My F-150 with a full tank of gas weights 5000 LBS
The amount of testosterone exuding from the point where they started talking about the cyber truck and betting each other who's "toy" could come up on top. Lmao Elon so confident he's like fetch that thing and shoot my car now 😂😂😂. Joe saying...I bet I could get in there...Elon saying I bet you won't. Lmao
what is that disgusting sound of someone chewing poop in the whole video?
Damn no safety glasses??? Yikes
He-Man looks tired.
Hey cutie 🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀💀
Now try a grenade 😂
I’d rather have a car that wasn’t the ugliest thing in existence than one that could stop an arrow
Nice hair product Joe. Is it the new Rogan?
Thank you for putting the best costume ever Joe  Team Rubio I love it 🔥
Joe says the arrow was 545 grains, which is about 35 grams.   He believes it was moving at 275 m/s, which would mean it had 2670 Joules of Kinetic Energy.   In comparison, an average 5.56 round has about 1800 Joules of energy, and that's an apples to apples comparison at short range (but the longer the trip, the slow arrow loses more energy to drag than the faster bullet).   Though to be fair, it left a dent in the steel door.
hahaha the costume is great, whilst having a serious convo.
I just love the fact that Elon is willing to just do this and go for it right then and there.
these are the 2 who should run usa
Woah it is hard to put an arrow through steel
Thatd be remarkable if Elon was able to hit a joint and still continue a serious conversation sitting across from relief pitcher Joel-dee-locks.
But it is still ugly as hell. Soooo
Elon is a neanderthal
Joe starts eating Elon's cartruck
Epic, Elon can you put one of those vehicles on reserve for JS, gonna need to make sure my freedom fighters can move around effectively and securely! :)
Elons a great sport ❤
But the windows crack. 🙃
What about a 70s car door aimed at a angle 🤔?? Should reflect off😅
car becomes a coffin in an accident that nobody will be able to get you out of.   fuck tesla.
Big flex for Elon
Elon has the weirdest but funniest laugh in history
Still can’t release the truck yet lol
7,000 pounds!!! holy fuck thats a massive turd!!!! my massive 1 ton diesel only weighs like 6,200 pounds... and the tesla truck is a small truck!!! electric cars are models of inefficiency!!! theyre stupid heavy
It blocked it so futuristically
maybe President Biden will order a new Tesla Presidential limo ,now that would be cool!
Pingtr1p is going to have a blast with this episode
That was impressive.
“I’ll bet you a dollar” -Elon Musk
Nice job eating pop rocks while filming an epic moment
Why is Joe wearing a Puerto Rico baseball jersey?
Yes, but I've had a deposit on a Roadster for many, many years now.  ???
What’s up with the Yellow hair
I love ELON EVIL LAUGH... 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Joe owes Elon a dollar
Instant classic entertainment.
Knowing that Elon could literally build us a Bat Mobile!
Dressed up like a Boricua haha
what cigar was he smoking
"Barely scratched it" *SOLID dent
I like how joe tries to tell a genius that he’s wrong lmao
joe dressed up as he-man, dope
Elon Musk for President.  He might be the coolest cat on the planet.  He's the only one that can save the USA.
The fuckin wig is killing me 😂
This is sick
And that ladies and gentleman is what's known as FUCK YOU MONEY!
Side impacts, also known as T-bone or broadside collisions, occur when a vehicle is struck on its side. These types of accidents can be very serious.   Side impacts can be dangerous because the side of a vehicle offers less protection compared to the front or rear. The force of the impact can directly affect the passenger compartment, potentially causing severe injuries to the occupants. Here are some key points to consider:  1. Occupant Protection: In side impacts, the head, chest, and abdomen are particularly vulnerable to injury. This is because there is less space and structural reinforcement on the sides of vehicles compared to the front and rear. Injuries can include head trauma, rib fractures, internal organ damage, spinal injuries, and pelvic fractures.  2. Safety Features: To help mitigate the effects of side impacts, Elons car is bulletproof.  3. Structural Reinforcement: Tesla trucks have implemented reinforced side structures to enhance the vehicle's ability to absorb and distribute the impact forces. These reinforcements are usually placed in the doors, pillars, and roof to provide additional protection and maintain the integrity of the passenger compartment.
wtf is Joe wearing. I cannot wait for pingtrip to make a video of this podcast!
There is a reason why steel plates went out of fashion for warfare when firearms proliferated.
I though it was an AI generated  video till they got in the garage!! 😅
What I want to know is HOW MANY trained killers are behind the camera walking around protecting Elon musk at any given moment that we can't see? I bet Elons bodyguards can whoop Joe Bidens secret service bodyguards anytime anywhere
We need to get a cyber truck in the hands of whistlin diesel
Can you ban the guy form chewing gum ever again
what about the cow holding the phone?
Joe!! I didn’t think you right wing magas liked transgender!! Great to see you coming out in support mate, needs a bit more lippy and some eye shadow!!  Jodie Rogan you go gurl!!!
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 Good'ol fun! 🎉
That's hilarious Rogan dressed as fake Rogan...I thought he was Ric Flair at first but he didn't walk off the podcast.
Why do you freaks like Elon?
instant brother love for both of them. wish i could have joined to just talk and adjust.. and talk and constantly just adjust faster and faster in meaning of rasterization.. i mean.. typical chill out situation with your bros, but just in a grown up state. THIS is what gets shit moving. you both are just meant to be!
whhy does he wears a wig ?:DDDDDD
I wonder if we could put a 350 4 bolt main in the electric truck
That wasnt fair. Joe should of let Elon shoot Joes car with the bow. lol
Who is going to shoot your car with a crossbow come on guys better Contant you’re talking to Elon Musk
Boys and their toys
Those compound bows are no joke. I struggle to even draw 80 lbs... That trucks gotta be heavy as something really heavy
Is the podcast in a warehouse or something?
It weighs more than 6k lol. Its guna be a commercial vehicle gvwr lol
3:36 that was fucking sick!
I heard a story from my hunting buddies about shooting an arrow out of a .410 and it hit the block wall on one side of the shed and stuck in the door behind everyone watching. No Bueno!  We could have lost a legend in Joe's bow test.
The airbow would probably penetrate
dude, please don't chew gum while recording....
Sick ok I re track wow
Im not an Elon fan but I still enjoy these types of conversations and how Joe makes things so chill.
This is the first vehicle in the history of the world that appreciated in value after being shot by an arrow
I love watching Elon have fun. It's like, what would you do if you where a multi billionaire, make bullet proof trucks and sell them to the public? Probably not, but its fun to watch 😅
Does it come in black? 🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇
Costs $60k to repair that dent.
Elon has the driest mouth ever. You can hear his lips touching every time. Does he not drink water? Do the audio engineers on the show not use noise gates ?
A full metal jacket bullets will go threw
Nice PR, should've fed L. Ron Musk mushrooms instead.
Joe needs to get Ranch Fairy on to talk about Kinetic Energy. The benefit he is getting for all of that bow and arrow is probably minimal and unnessecary.
Cant stand elon musk he will be the end of this world
Joe Rogan is such a bad influence on Elon😅😅
What will happen if cybertruck and a kia have an accident?
Ok, question Ive shot most types of bows; even some old african long bows as well as english long. But wtf; why is Joes "quiver" (maybe theres a newer term)  horizontal protruding outward? Id hate that. Drawing from a vertical is simple as fuck. Even drawing from a quiver on the hip is easy and honestly for fun drawing from a back quiver (Fantasy style) is easy for me cus i have long arms but the horizontal quiver looks so incumbersome. What am I missing? I hunt mostly deer but i can turn up my draw strength to 80lbs but that shit still looks unbalanced...?
What happened Joe.  Did you become a twisted sister?  Maybe a stylist for older ladies?  😂😂😂
Never realized how short Joe is
You can add backweights to a bolt Joe. I don't shoot crossbows, but I know you can add a ton of weight to them just like I do to my compound arrows.
Crossbows can be manageable at hundreds of pounds of draw weight.
This is a certified spoonkid classic!
When did Joe Rogan Podcast become Whistle Diesel haha
You crack me up Joe! 😂
my god the camera man chewing gum with an open mouth or something??????????
Joe looks like one Tim Tom from Venture Brothers. Look it up
This is as real as real gets. Fake people will get offended by it.
Thank you ballistics expert Elon Musk for creating perfect car for the coming apocalypse. Looking forward to the Hasan reaction to this one. Speaking of which when will Joe Rogan have him on the podcast?
Who chews like that. Also use a glass breaker
I love ❤️ you Elon!!!😊
He still hasn’t delivered my truck 😢
Best advertising Elon could ever get for those trucks. Brilliant
This was really neat.  Thanks Elon and Joe.  :)
Joe rogan the success story of being a stoner 😂
Why the blonde wig on Joe?
Manufacturing movie 🍿  Michael Keaton  Gung Ho  1986
who was that gibberish camera man wtf?
Elon for Pres.
I in no way mean to disrespect Elon Musk…..  But I’d be more inclined to buy a Cubertruck…IF it would come with a Diesel engine capable of generating power for the vehicle from a manufacturer that is known and trusted like Cummins.
What bourbon was Elon drinking?
Best convos ever with these two😂❤
😂Children😂
“Hey cutie” @4:04 😂
Elon’s a G
Is no one here aware of what a moron Elon is? Lol
I can’t wait for this truck.
Man it looked like it made a good mark on that door that's for sure.
Best costume ever!!! Team Rubio from Puerto Rico 🇵🇷
Damn Joe is getting older. Elon too just look at the wrinkles
Where’s his dollar? 🤷🏽‍♂️
Joerg Sprave  probably has a "pencil" cross bow that could shoot through both doors.  Meha ha ha!
Who was the goof ball chewing their gum like a fish out of water when joe was shooting the arrow. Who chews like that lmao?
Welcome to Demolition Ranch!
Elon Musk is such a down to Mars person.
It took me a whole minute to realize this isn't AI generated... Improve the camera and lighting quality.
Elon still pitching that goofy cybertruck. TSLA is a joke and people are finally seeing through his Barnum and Bailey circus act.
Elon needs this car for protection
Hey cutie 💀💀💀
What a great scene. What's the name of the movie?
joe is a liar...pizza with pineapple and anchovy is awful
Wait the title wasn't figurative?
Elon ain’t taking anymore chances haha bro bet a dollar 😂
Elon the scam man.
You built this like just for fun? Elon built a flame thrower for fun lololol
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
need more elon and joe
Sweet, got a long drive tomorrow to listen to this 🤙   Edit: Rich people doing rich people things on this one uh …
Elon is reminding me of Jeff gold lump on Independence Day the way he smokin his cigar
Where can i buy this bow??
That was awesome!!!
Cyber truck is trash. He took all them deposits and never produced anything
🇵🇷❤️
Flash Gordon and Elon Musk, who would have guessed
" hey cutie" lmao
Welp its official. Joe officially has the coolest life on earth right now
lol  love these guys together  !!
https://youtu.be/ntC0xJo2bSU?si=1IEdXHYM_w5TnLgN
Joe and Elon, best entertainment on the internet.
Elon you should speak more. They joke you and make it seems like you’re crazy.
Oh come on Joe. You're wearing a Courtney wig. Kurt is not smiling upon you. Can you stop with this nonsense
Let's do all crazy experiment on Joe's podcast
Amazing truck fascinating man
Why a girls wig? lol
How in the world did he get Elon to come back after the weed disaster from the first interview, it woulda been crazy if Elon woulda came back a full blown drug addict blaming Joe..lol I have several Cybertruck Hot Wheels, i'm a big fan of Tesla anything.
Why is Joe dressed as Jimmy Saville?
Hey cutie🥰 jajajajaj
I don’t care what anyone says, Elon is an absolute badass! So confidently just challenged Joe Rogan to shoot an arrow through his truck RIGHT NOW, because he know’s how bulletproof it is.
Joe and Elon and legends bro
Putting a dent in someone's car, not cool!😠
Joe Rogan ended to segment looking like Rick Flair.
“Hey cutie”😂
imagine holding the camera while joe rogan and elon musk shoot a cybertruck with a bow and youre chewing gum with your mouth open, into the fucking mic..
Elon musk is so awesome
Elon has a great laugh when he is being ridiculous.
4:04 LMFAOOOO
Isn't the Earth for people to live on? Why save it if it means sacrificing human lives in the process?
They must be stainless steel panels?
This is why Elon doesn’t need to advertise his products
Imagine doing that to any other car or truck, I bet it will come out of the other side for some cars.
The 👉ANY 👈Podcast has EM in it , it's the coolest thing you could spend 10 min. off your Life!😋😻
Bro eye protection. 😊
Looks like Prince Adam got high and half way changed to He-Man, but said fuck it, I'm chillin'
Puertorican Hi-man! 🇵🇷
The ultimate meeting of minds: Joe Rogan, the master of conversation, and Elon Musk, the genius entrepreneur, you just know it ends with Joe shooting Elon's car with a crossbow.. 🤣
God bless these guys!😂😂😂🎉
Ya if a 9 mil doesn't go through I doubt any arrow goes through.. maybe a ballista bolt
Two antisemites?
My dually 95 f350 xlt super dury is under 6000 lbs😂
Joe rocking that Heman hair lol
What kind of cigars does Elon smoke?
Would it be bulletproof if rifle rounds were used?
With all the maniacs selling guns, and the homicidal maniacs that use them in the US, a bulletproof affordable vehicle is genius! Nobody is getting illegal gun use under control anytime soon. Mr Musk will save a lot of lives.
Elon is the biggest clown. Its gonna be funny when he finally goes bankrupt.
Joseph you should've used a trad broadhead 200/225grams 550 spline 25/30 gram knock, at 275 feet a sec. WOW
"I'll bet you a dollar" -Elon. I busted out laughing
5,000lbs of batteries? I want one
This clip is epic.... Elon & Joe... Best combo ever... I'd love to hear them both do UFC commentary 🤣.... I wish Joe would return to YouTube...I can't afford another subscription!... And god, you gotta love Elon.... If he handed out all of "HIS" worth to "fix" the world, it wouldn't work, governments would eat his money.... so nice to see man having some well earned fun with "HIS OWN MONEY"... it's his and his only (just in case any socialists reply to this, my answer is here in advance 😂) 🇬🇧♥️🇬🇧♥️🇬🇧
Expose the Zero Point Energy, we need disclosure
I want to know what a firefighter does to open these APC's
I need to watch this episode
holy shit, that's crazy
Hey cutie 😂😂😂😂
The most understandable man on the planet and the richest man on the planet.. what a time to be alive.
This is some "next level" marketing. Reminds me of the South Park episode where ads disguise themselves as things other than ads.
Elon: “you can make a heavy crossbow arrow”  Yea if you’re involved I’m sure we could 😂
Such a cool hang Elon bruh the GOAT undoubtedly
The fact Elon can keep straight face is hilarious.
Ralphy, You”ll shoot your eye out with that thing.
"Yeah my bow could go through it" what an idiot. Tell me you dont know what you're talking about without telling me you don't know wtf you're talking about
Richest man on earth bets a dollar, caveman won't hurt his truck, what a time to be alive.
Maybe a 30+ inch draw would up the Anne
This man is tony stark
its simple. Speed = penetration
Make a gas version of this truck, I'll buy it!!
Yeah folks, that is what unlimited money looks like. "Wanna shoot an arrow at my car?" "Sure, let's do it now"
elon musk is a bigot. how dare he buy twitter, how dare he unlock people that i spent 3 days banning.  hes fake, emerald mines ree ree ree!!!
Xqc fell off lol
Am I the only one who doesn't know why Joe has that thing on his head?
What’s the rating up to? It’d be dope af if it can withstand 50 bmg
I feel like a practice tip would’ve done better. The only reason I think that is because when you’re splitting wood, it doesn’t matter how sharp your maul is it just takes a good hit… and a practice tip would’ve held it’s edge better
Elon wants to sell cybertrucks to police departments.
I am a Texas rancher with a small ranch. I would love to try out a tesla truck on the ranch and see how it handles off road and pulling cattle trailers!
Gay rituals
arrow bounces, takes them both out and we are deprived of two thought leaders!!!
The smart person positions themself between the shooter and the engine block. NOT the door!
as someone with archery experience, I've almost been hit by an arrow I've shot at a hard surface and it ricocheting right back at me, probably horrible luck but you wouldn't catch me doing this again 😅
What cigars are they smoking?
Wow the front crumple zone on that CyberTruck must be made for the zombie apocalypse! 🤣🤣
who is the fcker smacking on the gum lmao.
Elon got that generational wealth laugh 😂
This is cool for ten different reasons.
Is that Joe's natural hair?
I'M no expert but I don think a compound bow or cross bow will penetrate any car door  I know my crossbow which is 130 Lbs doesnt even penetrate a wooden door 🤠
Ohh shit…elon back on!! Ask him about those damn aliens JOE!!!!! 😂
SOLD!
My man looking like He-Man with that wigg 😂😂😂.
This is some trippy AI generated video
Trucks are supposed to be tough, but they also need to haul/pull a reasonable amount (6000-9000lbs) a reasonable distance (300-400mi) on a single tank.  Then refill that tank and come home, usually within several hours.  Until then, this is just another novelty, an incredible one, but nothing more.
4:05 😹
Doesn’t count he did it without the wig on!  Ps Joe should frame the arrow and broad-head and gift it to Elon
How many 7.62 can it cope with
Shooting arrow at it? I can guarantee a thousand percent nobody ever will shoot an arrow at you if you own one of those. Maybe Joe should have tried a 7.62 Full Metal Jacket.
When Elon Musk bets you ONE DOLLAR
Joe: 'I bet I can get an arrow in there.' Cybertruck: 'I've survived a Tommy gun, but sure, take your best shot.' My confidence when I try to plug in a USB on the first try.
Joe looks like an 80’s guy in California lol
The whole cybertruck meme was that he accidentally broke the "bulletproof window" and then Joe doesn't even shoot the window...nice clickbait Joe.
Hey cutie 😂🎉
Musk is the best .
Now THIS is YouTube at its peak - *Joe Rogan shooting an arrow into the world's richest man's car who is just smoking a cigarr watching* 😎
Here before 1 billion views
Thank you for the costume Joe From PR
My kinda episode
This is surreal
nice hair
That was dangerous
GREAT
Joe Rogan is a cool kid. I love how he destroyed the Mencia thief and is so liquid with subject matter experts.   Plus, in a 1:1 or as a wingman, he is not to be messed with.  It really seemed unplanned, and would’ve loved to see a glass test, but Elon saying “Hey Cutie” was funny as all.
That's the funniest costume of all time.
shout out the camera guy chewing gum real loud
And we use coal and gas to run the generators that charge these clown cars
Wax Museum Schwarzenegger didn't give a F when Joe blasted that thing at his truck. Go hydrogen!
Cybertruck JRE Edition. Extra $25k and it could be yours.
Camera man chewing gum hardddddd
what's up with the wig?
This man is so damn sexy.
"...I'll bet you a dollar."  "I just realized I have a broad head and a bow."
Is Joe being that cartoon character He-man
😂😂😂😂
4:01 who the fuck is deep throating their gum
Drives around casual in his armoured vehicle with basically and unstoppable engine with a 0-60 of 3.5 seconds 😂 legend.  What's the odds his one has extra armour for his personal safety
Had to do a double take and make sure this wasn't AI. Slipped my mind it is Halloween LOL.
Legendary
Dude that laugh was crazy , like evil genius type sh
i love that from 3:00 to 4:00 I just hear gum being chewed
He's going for the police car market! Fast and bullet proof ha
Did Elon Musk say he wants to armwrestle the ceo of Ford motor company on new years eve pay per view?
This truck is built for the coming civil war.
What happens if you put 2 Narcissists in a Room..
Imagine the CEO of another large company just hanging out and shooting arrows at the company’s prototype model vehicle, phone, computer, whatever. And then posting the video online.  It never happens, this is so cool. Does make me wonder if they agreed to not post it if it didn’t go well though.
Lol elon just looks so funny smoking haha
Elon's laugh is too contagious 😂
Elon's laugh is contagious
Listening to Elon giggle at the arrow exploding on the door is hilarious
I kinda feel Joe missed a chance there.  Ok, it stops an arrow, but can it stop a grizzly bear?  🤔 Oh wait, Elon said it has beast mode, so it probly beat the crap out of 1. 😉
Well history has just been made folks
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Badass 🔥🔥
Elon looks stressed
Elon and Joe are a good duo bc they both bring something chaotic, badass, funny, informative, and interesting to the table every time.
More Joe and Elon!
Bet you a dollar. Lol
That laugh RIVALS the Jeff Bezos going to space laugh @2:58
Cyber Truck is built for Mars.
Nice Shirt
Joe "I have a 90 lb compound bow that shoots 520 grain arrows at 300 feet per second" Rogan
cause he's batman!
All i can hear is the gum in the camera mans his gob.. (as Rogan is taking the shot)...
WHO THE FUCKIS CHEWING GUM WHILE RECORDING?! So obnoxious
This was badass! Definitely cool to see Joe and Elon kicking it so casually lol
I wanted to make love with my girlfriend..... well... she can wait now. i need to watch that shit like...  10 times in a row  .... Joe and Elon... wait a podcast  man...🎉❤😮😊
The truck is fucking giant, look at it. I want it.
These would be very popular in Montana circa 1883.
Ended up with an arrow in my truck last time at the bar lol only went thru the outer sheet of the bed
When your life is awesome you're smoking cigars, drinking whisky and shooting trucks with arrows 😂
A rare moment when a vehicle actually increased in value from damage.
Girls: He's  probably cheating on me  Guys:
I’m not sure what the point of shooting a car with a arrow is, how many times will that be needed
Amazing
Jo is so sexy❤
That was impressive.
Is Joe supposed to be Urijah Fabre as a 50 year old retired skateboarder ?
Hunting, insecurity personified
Joe Rogan I ❤that PUERTO RICO 🇵🇷 jersey !😍👍
This is so fxcking funny.  WEIRDEST car ad, EVER. And yet I would bet you anything this 'stunt' sells AT LEAST one of these lmaooooo
What’s with the blonde wig?
I bet law enforcement would love that truck.
Why don’t they have a tri-fold solar panel if stationary on the back of the cyber truck trunk lid if surface area is the issue?   For one I can’t afford a cyber truck but range would be the key issue for hunt trips out west or longer trips in general.
Joe you look like the cutest blonde sloth in this wig
I fucking love this type of shit
Hes what a billionaire should be.   Lol thats awesome.
Shill
That thing is so effin ugly
This is the peak Joe Rogan content we have all been waiting for 🤣, only thing next is it cutting to a bear and a chimp or tiger or someshit fighting 🤣🤣
Joe Jus😮Broke Da Net Wit This One … Million plus in few hrs
Doesn’t a Tommy Gun shoot 9mm?
A lot of people don't know this but an arrow has more penetrating power then a rifle bullet.  That was amazing.
That's impressive. Cool. Also, if elon ever wants to become a megalomaniacal ruler of the world, he's already got the laugh for it. Lmao.
Can I hang out with Joe and Elon one day.
2:33 "9 mil or a 45 which is basically a 10 mil" bruh
just seeing only this video of joe and elon would make me love them..  cigars, whiskey, bows, and a truck.  sounds like a great time to me.
Joes was not on his game for this interview.  However, I'm still happy he had Elon on his show and its still amazing to hear the two discuss stuff.
i would kill for a cyber truck...
Is that trans Rogan? So brave
substitutos en español porfavor? Gracias ❤
Holy shit that's impressive
Bro that arrow head goes right over the left of the camera mans shoulder.
Oh yeah, with the ever worsening crime stats, there is definitively a big market for semi armored / light armored cars in the USA (and Europe), especially for the cities ! But it should be more armored than that : An arrow shouldn't be able to even scratch it. No need to be able to do 0 to 60 under 3 sec, the important part is to be able to resist gun shoots and stone throwing and stabbing and so on, including in the windows.
No Joey you cant get an arrow in my truck
Joe Rogan would make a perfect Mo Howard for Halloween  God bless America
This is what makes JRE different from any other Pod, “you wanna shoot an arrow through my prototype Cyber Truck? “ “yeah, let’s do it!”
Why is he wearing a Jimmy Saville wig and smoking a Jimmy Saville cigar? 😬😬
Happy Halloween everyone!
That's a compound bow not cross bow
Elon Musk - “I’ll bet you a dollar” 😂 love how down to earth and genuine he is 💯😎
Elon you mentioned with Joe Rogan today that it wasn't possible to run a car with solar panels, but last week I got my Altera and so far it has given me over 40 miles a day on solar power and the full battery goes up to 1,000 miles,  You've never heard from Aptera? I'm surprised you never hear of them or are you lying? 😮
is it just me or is Elon becoming more and more less interesting
Looks like Eddie got through to Joe after all.
I've seen one of trucks coming down Ronald Reagan Parkway at 5 am in the morning.  I could tell by the lights, thought for a second batman passed me.😅
fElon is a conman.
I'd have gone without a broadhead.
Your fine behind if your behind the motor of a gaz car, myth busters actually proved that. Not gonna work with EV since  motors are small in the wheels.
My lord marolyn monroe didnt take 2023 to well
My bolts are 450GPI
You want speed not weight when it comes to penetration pun intended
elon is a remarkable human regarding the achievements of his companies. he deserves credit of course but there are a lot of workers involved in those achievements as well. I say that to say, lately Elon is behaving in a way that reminds me that what I truly believe is billionaires are grotesque. hundreds of billions is a f*%cking impossibly gigantic number. just saying... as for joe, low-key legend of course.
just wait until the next police chase involving a cyber truck....  Cops cant do shit.... next think you know the Dems will be trying to ban them for being too safe lol
These psychos are so much fun together 😂😂😂😂
THIS IS THE FUTURE
I love the fact that they can have a straight forward convo with Joe wearing that wig 😂 This reminds me of a guy I once saw having a serious debate while wearing a propeller beanie.
joe pls tell your camera/sound ppl not to chew gum whilst they are filming you it really triggers ppl with mysophobia.i was darn to this vid by the idea of shooting the cybertruck and driven away by the sound of chewwing gum.
Fire the guy chewing gum into the mic
see these trucks driving around newark, and fremont all the time now.
Hey joe, those dark bags under your eyes are indicative of serious issues with your kidneys. Time to go on a long detox my friend and get those kidneys functioning properly.
Joe’s looking really well these days.. has he done something different with his hair?
Let me test it, I will tell you how tought that truck is! Lbs
3:02   Wth is that noise throughout that segment of Joe shooting the cyber truck? It sounds like someone is just eating really vigorously close to the camera.
Elon is well versed in the penetrating power of crossbows it seems. He's right. Its the hollow point of the middle ages. Its purpose is to go though armor and it did it so well people stopped using armor.
Peep the Puerto Rico Jersey Rogan is wearing 👍
Elon is the man!!!
This is why I love Tesla. Made and designed in America!
Musk and truck are both impressive, but what about sitting on top of a massive EMF field everyday? Why is nobody talking about this?  The science is clear!
Lmao, it’s incredible ! Made me laugh !
Meat JoeAnne! 🤣🤣🤣👏👏👏
After 10 or 12 seconds, I had to turn away and watch some thing else, it is so hard on the ears to try to understand how this man is communicating, he is a genius when it comes, inventing, maybe, but when it comes to being a Social human being, Jesus Christ your killing me Smalls! I’m going to go back to car crashes now.
This is peak entertainment.
Ape man talks to Ape brain on Halloween type beat™️
Mr Beast is gonna get one just to shoot it with a tank
I need to get on this level of fun. Elon’s laugh is my favorite
i legit thought joe was right. i expected the arrow to go through
We need to investigate the male brain. Cause now I want a cyber truck so badly.
I like how Muck know how door really work
Knowing what happened before with the window are we to believe they would try this without knowing the outcome?😅
I think Elon musk is one fun person to party with. Very quiet but up for anything 😂😂😂
I want one so bad But couldn't afford it If I could I couldn't afford to install the charger or  rewire my house
Merica!!
4:27  shme on you! You don’t even know how to wear a wig 😂 it’s upside down, flip it pls!
Guess there is only four or five of them built; been waiting fours years to buy one; now I question why!
What was great about this pod is you saw that even in an interaction between the most successful guys on the planet can suffer from social awkwardness. Joe crashing from all those carbs 😂
Force = Mass* Velocity^2  Velocity is a much bigger influence than mass.
who TF was chewing into the mic what he actual fuck
tight haircut joe. mad style points
Hilarious awesome video.
Blond hair, sports clothes, fat cigar.  That's only a Yorkshire accent away from a Jimmy Savile impersonation.
🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
"lets do it right now" - both of them
Joe looks like He Man😂
Joe Rogan wearing a Puerto Rico baseball shirt shooting a Tesla truck with an arrow is the most national thing in US history 😂😂😂😂
That a badass truck😊
Listening to the cameraman chewing gum smacking the lips together is like nails on a chalkboard
When he shot the arrow it left a clearly visible dint in the door. My first reaction was "That's a shame". Then I thought about it a bit more and realized, what a cool story. How did you get that dint Elon?  Oh, Joe Rogan shot it with an arrow when I was on his podcast.
I'm just here for that hot blonde guy.
These are my two favorite people on the planet ❤😂
Elon says "trucks are supposed to be tough, right?". What a badass. LOL
still really dont get the instant hate rogan gets ...
damn i want a cybertruck lmao that thing is sick af
Why the fuck is Joe wearing a Puerto Rico jersey?! 🇵🇷 ❤
this was AWESOME!
Love it
Bro Elon And Joe are like podcast gold
I love it when rich people wager a dollar. Shows how little money means to them.
I love this.  I have a (repeating - it has a magazine) compound crossbow to try.
WTH am I seeing here?
almost perfect.. if only it came in Vanta Black with 5% all around tint..
this some rich people shit nah im good
That was a bad-ass moment.  Thanks to Elon and Joe.  ❤️🎃
this video is about to go to 10mill views lol frigin incredible
The silly shit rich people do. I love it!! 😂
THIS AWHOL VIDEO IS A.I
The thumb nail 😅
This is just too cool
Now, this is the science we wanted to learn in school.
Not gunna lie that truck looks so good
Joe rogan should have dressed as AOC just for elon.
In the old old days the cars were made like ranks and you could hide but no one alive remembers those days too well lol
Elon looks like the Terminator now
“Hey cutie” 😂
Joe, you look like jimmy saville with that blonde wig on
Joe looks like he could be one of Maxims most beautiful women of the year.
Joe really would like to see a black bear break into it.
Joe looks like the transgender man who freaked out at Game Stop 😂🤣 "Excuse me, it's Ma'am"
Joe and Elon are a whole damn vibe 😂
No safety glasses while shooting a bow and arrow into the cyber truck is the new Darwin Award
Rogan is high as phuck
Barely scratched it - meanwhile fat ass dent in the door
Does Joe want one now?
Amazing episode. That’s what happens when two intellectuals interact intelligently. 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
If an arrow made a dent... a bullet would go through. People thinking this truck is Robocop.
lol that’s cool 😂
This is the equivalent of Captain America's first time barely lifting Thor's hammer.
Love watching the differences between knowledge vs science.
Hello Elon is there any possibility you can design a new styled crossbow.
Holy shit that was dope
How about cop car can you hide behind door is someone shooting
if this proves anything it proves spending time on social media will age you fast no matter how much money or who you are
What a ‘poseur’, this Elon Musk. Another example of what excessive wealth will do to your ego.
Cars get in crashes, people have to escape if they can. Rolling death trap right there fellers.
Is Joe supposed to be He-man?
How does it feel that the richest man in the world just made a bet with you for a SINGLE DOLLAR?
I'm fairly confident that Joe will be able to shoot through the Cybertruck by the end of next year. 🤞
Bald people low key love wearing wigs even while acting like its a joke 😂
I’m dying to know what’s in that cup 😂
WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPNEING
I like the hair
Totally epic af. 💯
Lol ganglands about to meet Tron
This at a time when the federal government is trying to outlaw bulletproof vehicles for civilians.
Joe nailed it, the arrow has more kinetic energy but I’m more impressed that he has a 90lb at home, good lawd Joe. Punching Elons rig, now that would make J. Dudley proud!
Why does Joe Rogan have a blonde wig on?
Protest proof
I love that!  I’ll bet ya a dollar!
@4:04 😂 🤣 #EM #Cybertruck #Tesla 💪🏾
He’s probably the coolest guy you could hang out with. I’d like to hear what he thinks about lost ancient tech that supposedly existed.
What two obscenely rich individuals do in their spare time.
I cannot bare the sound of the camera guy chewing his gum.
If Joe wore that wig more often he would be cover of gq magazine.
Legend has it Joe never gave up that dollar.
King Elon Musk. You are a good person with a big heart. Please stay like this..👏👏❤️❤️. 🤚
The paddy wig is killin it
Modification for police vehicles would be sweet to see
Inane conversation.
The only thing that would top this is if Joe got a grizzly bear to attack the Cybertruck. 😄
“I bet you a dollar”  coming from the richest man hits different.
Radest dudes huh,Awesome!
Who else watched the full episode on Spotify and came here to read comments 😂😂😂  #AmazingConversation
Joe owes Elon a dollar
Oh I hope he makes a gas or diesel version with extra large fuel tanks in place if the planet destroying lithium batteries., make it affordable as well? He’d sell billions, building these as electric vehicles actually does more harm to the environment than it would to make them as fuel efficient as possible.
Great episode! Always good when the two of them get together.
Elon is a savage!
Elon’s laugh after was scary, impressive car tho
Ayeee whats joe must of lost a bett with a PuertoRican lmaooo
Imagine thinking Elon tells the truth! 😅
He's aged a lot since twitter lmao
"Hey cutie" 🤣🤣
Lmao the way Elon is legit interested
Joe rogan dressed up like Jimmy Saville shooting an arrow into a crazy billionaires futuristic space truck, all whilst taking a sh*t, really makes you appreciate the world we live in.
I can tell this clip is going to be memed on
This is such a jre moment that I had to check 3 times just to make sure this was real
So I did the math, 80lb draw 29" arrow with 125g iron will* guessing 285 fps=99.10 ke momentum .6954 m
I like the fact that Joe just happens to have a bow with him
Who the hell behind the camera is smakin' their gum like a cow chewing grass. Jesus
But looks. Ugly!!! And stupid. Keep  it!👎
He said I Bet you $1 😂 Joe Rogan owes him $1.
Tf is chewing the hell out of that gum holding the camera 😭
Be elon, tell joke, instantly explain joke, laughs historically
3:12 Chewing noises drive me up the wall.
What costume does joe have on?
My ex would find a way to total the car without trying.
Elons talking and Joe's literally off in his own head still thinking about the arrow vs truck and how to accomplish it
At first glance,  I thought some Ai hijacked Joe and put a wig on him. But no,  it is really Joe that  put on a wig on himself.  Oh sht,  Joe is moving to the other side.  What is wrong with you,  Joe?  What the hel are you smoking? Until now,  you have always been my standard of what a man should look and be like.  All gone,  so sad.
Joe has the best intrusive thoughts
If it is Armoured you need speed to beat it not mass, a heavier projectile will travel at a lower muzzle velocity.  Force = Mass x Acceleration.  Elon is showing his age, and looking like Hugh Hefner, by saying car doors are mild steel, more like mostly aluminium now which is even weaker, look at what happens to the aluminium box Ford put on their trucks!  And yeah, the only safe place to hide from bullets around a car is behind the engine block.
Joe looks like He-Man
Mr. Musk how long have you  and brother Ishmael from the king pin extra known each other for?
Joe and Elon, just the shit.  Straight up the most legit guys on the planet…
He got elon to eat double pineapple double anchovie pizza after 😂😂😂
Wonder if Joe paid up to Elon. A bet's a bet!!
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE GUM CHEWING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  MY MISOPHONIA!!!!!! IS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ... GGGGGRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 😖🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫+🔫
Damn I haven't seen Joe for a couple of months but he aged quick.
All the cartel will be driving the cyber truck.
When the end of the world comes these two need to the podcast for it. Sitting in Eli's secret bunker with a few invited guests and their families as Joe and Eli look out over the chaos and discuss how to rebuild the earth to look really friggin cool. Then Joe says Hey Jamie check and see if there any bears left.
I’m confused by the Joe/Cyber size ratio.
That truck looks ridiculous
I fucking love this
The Joe and Elon combo is as good as it gets.   This is really what the people want
If he doesn't fix that door the price of the vehicle could go up astronomically
And they ordered pizza!! But pineapple?! Sardines??
Elon musk has an amazing talent for conning stupid people
yooo that Arrowhead ricocheted right past Jamie, they all lucky!
Elon's South African roots showing - bullet proof trucks are what we all need.
Who was chewing behind the camera during that
Joes a MIDGIT, that's why he does Steroids and HGH. Little Man Tate. You know he also has Little Hands & Feet, and a little Dinky. All that Money will never get him the things he wants the most. He sold his Soul for fame and fortune so hells waiting for him but he's miserable here to for not possessing the things said above so I guess I hope he lives forever. Little Puke.
😂 if a 9mm 10 mm or 45mm won't penatrate it,.. no and arrow will not.
The organic nature of this happening in real time was special.
That was awesome 😂 👏🏽
Wow, actually for a minute I actually thought I was hallucinating but then I realized that this clip is real! 🙂 I'm a big fan of both Elon and Joe. Lately there has been such a backlash against Elon on the web, but I realized that it is totally a case of uninformed jealous little pr*cks who have never really accomplished anything in the real world! It's like a blue whale being "attacked" by a swarm of brine shrimp. And Joe's The Man, of course. (Personally I have 3 recurve bows but I'm such a wimp that they are only rated between 35-40 lbs draw. 🤨But someday I wanna become a big boy and graduate to a compound bow. 😋)
Elon is based.
Now I need to see a broad head hit a  regular car 😂
I will still never buy anything EV yet
This is so bad ass lol 😂 👏
Elon looks just miserable , old , tired, hair looks like it’s thinning again…. Rough shape dude .  I don’t know what’s going on but I think he’s having problems with Tesla , interest rates , and his acquisition of Twitter. He’s tapped man. I feel bad for this guy he’s addicted to growth. He’s going to end up in the hospital
Why does Joe have a girl wig on?
Joe looking like he’s got the power of Grayskull.
just buy the ev hummer..
I love Joe's costume 😭
The cyber truck weighs 7,000 lbs. Takes 500,000 lbs. of earth to make the battery, costs at least 60k to buy, is completely worthless when the battery dies or gets a fender bender, when it catches fire immediately burns at 10k degrees Fahrenheit and you aren't allowed to ever have anyone work on it other than their brilliant techs. Ok have fun
This is Tony Stark over and over again.. terrorists are going to use that truck in a few years..
What kind of cigar is that?
Elons laugh after they came back from shooting the truck is like a Baron watching peasants be dragged by his steeds through the cobblestone streets
Jamie, stop chewing gum! Bad form for a producer! 😛
Slick move..Elon is building military vehicles…he used the cyber truck hype simply to promote the Tesla brand but its t really for the military…. darpa.. war machine Elon.
Hey cutie 😂
Legends
Who's Joe supposed to be or Halloween, anyone know???? LOL
Hey guys just so you know, a "Tommy Gun" shoots 9mm. So by saying 9mm and Tommy in the same sentence it proves Elon doesn't really like guns
I've got armor piecing bullets I made that can Pierce through a engine block Elon
BUY TESLA STOCK Now
look at Elon's hands during this, says a lot
man hate to see rogan in a wig , i mean why bro ?
In my experience, crossbow bolts are 3 TIMES the weight of arrows
The Demolition ranch guy is like .. "hold my beer"
Only Elon musk says yeah you can shoot my car  Oh you're not prepared? I got someone for that I can get them to go get it  Then proceeds to be like is your car bullet proof  I was called broked 10 different times in 25 different ways in just a few mins
Elon frigin rocks haha “let’s do it now!” He doesn’t care that his car is dented, the scar is now a great story
Having a tough truck is definitely a necessity in my business. You can barely lean on modern pickups.
Elon knows he made them bulletproof for the homies down in Oblock
I do love it when these two get together 😂
Puerto rico  🇵🇷
JOE ROGAN KILLS ELON MUSK!?!? WTF WERE YOU THINKING 🤯
I think only a very powerful crossbow shooting with a hardened steel bodkin tip has a chance
All cars should be arrow proof 😮that’s sick!
Joe with the Puerto Rico jersey   🔥
Can't wait to see the pingtrip version of this podcast
Elon invented the durability of KITT. Now he needs to create the AI.
What a beautiful mane. : D
Is it EMP and DEW proof?
Can imagine a few people getting these and going 5 star wanted mode.
Give me a 99 Ford F-150 or Give me liberty!
Awwwww I’m going crazy this podcast is so fire 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
This question came to mind.. someone give me an answer or your thoughts.   Ok so.. is it possible on an EV to have the generators on the hubs so that while driving they keep a charge on the batteries and the need for a charge outside of driving could potentially be decreased or not need for long periods of time?
Traffic accidents gonna be crazy 🤣
this  car is ugly
Giving criminals a reason to drive it
waiting to see cybertruck do the baja rally!! i bet it's in the next 50 or 100 years for sure!! go Elon!, do some shameless plug in advertising for the "truck" that will sink Tesla.
That truck is worth so much more, now that Rogan shot at it.
The cameraman and that gum tho. Lol
I have a friend who is police. I asked why speed limits are still so slow when technology has advanced in vehicles exponentially over the last 40 years. He said "the cars are better, the brakes are better, the steering is better...........but people are still just as stupid when they drive." Checkmate!! I don't want people driving 7000 lbs of metal that goes from 0- 60 in less than 3 seconds.
Joe Mulvaney? WTF.....
I know so many people that mimic Joe Rogan marijuana is the cure-all and I'm a bowhunter. Gotta Love Elon
I love everything about this ❤
no way youre shooting 90 pounds
Fucking hilarious conversation 😂💪
god damn! It's nice to be rich! Elon didn't even flinch
Was the camera man chewing on the mic while filming shooting the car? My god! Make it stop!
4:09 when your one buddy gets too drunk and says "i bet i can take a 2x4 to the back of the head and not get knocked out" *body drops*
The bow is definitely more impressive than shooting it with a gun. Bows have amazing penetrating powe're a gun usually kills with shock force
Joe: "I have a 90lb compound bow... but it's at my house." Elon: "Should we send someone to go get it!?"
Its bullet proof shootba gun bro your in Texas get outta here w that bow shit
joe thinks its his real hair
I bet he could shoot an arrow into the side of my 97 chevy pick up.  But my truck can pull a boat to the lake and back or full of stuff and go several hindered mile loaded down without having to stop and charge for an hour or more. This last thing and not the arrow is why you still can't get the cybertruck.  But still would be cool to drive if I didn't have to pay for it.
I think Elon comes on just to smoke pot 🤣
ELON IS THE GOD,,,,, HE IS THE BEST
The spontaneity is what I love about Elon. He is the opposite of "Stuck in rut".
That's a really goofy quiver on his bow.
Since when is joe rogan team rubio??
Hey cutie 🤗 gheheheheheee 😝
Field tips penetrate better than broad heads
That’s crazy……  Joe. Has his own level of intellectual ability…. And Elon is  above the  moon 🌚  awesome  seeing these two  hang.  Haha. Awesome.
Glad to see my high school teacher chilling with Elon
Well that convo probably sold a few more trucks. The way this shit is headed who doesnt need a bullet proof truck?
Most powerful crossbows have the greatest kinetic energy
I’ve never seen views increase like this while watching a YouTube video
Clicked ahead to 1:15 by mistake, so the 1st thing I see is Joe dressed like a fkn cheer leader with a He-Man wig asking if he can try it with an arrow. 🤣
DIS IS FOOKIN SICK MATE
Very cool.
Just to remind people this truck in not in the production yet, so don't go depositing downpayments on it.
Woooooo Woooooooo ahhh Woooooo
Jimmy Houston has a podcast? Lol
Where's my fucking dollar
What powers that Truck? It better be hydrogen! There is a video on YouTube where they converted a old truck with a V8 to hydrogen just by replacing the intake and heads! Elon if you read this, we need regional Factory’s threw out the US and the World to convert Existing vehicles too Hydrogen! Pretty Please With Sugar on Top🙏🏻
Two of the most influential people of 2023 just shooting the bull
'We dug our own grave with Cybertruck' - Elon.
Hey Elon your cars got a scratch now, how about you throw it my way. Pleeaseee...
Well. Now we know.
zero eye protection rofl
That was fun!
Joe rogan great guy but some shit he asks is just a waste of time
I think the only time someone’s car has gone up in value being damaged 😂
Only a person living in the hell ridden landscape of San Francisco would think that you need to make a truck and bulletproof 😂
I am suitably impressed
Imagine watching this video 20 years from now… there’s a lot of splainin’ to do
Thats fucking all time! hahaha
Elon amd Joe are epic bro😊
It's still ugly as f..... And unnecessarily over engineered unless Elon is expecting the Civil War to start soon.
The most satisfying video i have watched in a longtime.. Elon legend
I can't believe Michael Fabricant managed to get Elon Musk on his show!?
The CyberTruck is gonna be the new Hellcat
I love the two of you just have a casual conversation. Very entertaining!
Rogan: can i shoot a bear into it 🐻?
I was really hoping joe kept the wig on while shooting the bow😭
Ffff elon and enough joe
when the video cuts back in at 4:30 joe is drunk af hahahaha
But how bout that brick?
I dont get this wig trend among creators all of a sudden. Did I miss the memo???
“I bet you a Dollar”  a genuine rich person bet.
Joe...i would like to know how the heck this guy does not know about nuclear propulsion...he said he did not in your pop cast memba?
Joe I'm currently living on tha street cuz work is so hard to come by I'm using McDonald's wifi do you got any work and believe me I'll work hard I was working in the fields until the season lasted and now I've can't find a job and it's been a month I don't like begging but I need a hand I just need work I'm depressed because i can't find nun I'm down man.
This is the best thing I've seen in awhile.
How'd they get the guy who looks like Joe Rogan on!?
He-Man needs to stop smoking so much...not looking too healthy.
Cyber truck, baby. Cyber. Truck.
Cybertruck is doom already. He said it himself, 'We dug our own grave with Cybertruck' - Elon.
I'm just a Joe and Elon fan who just checked in. What is up with the wig?
x2 of my favourite guys right there! So glad Elon is back! Love the conversations they have. It’s great!  Loving the outfit too!
lol they just happened to have a cyber truck on hand
Who needs a truck that’s bulletproof when we don’t live in a shit hole country where you have to worry about getting shot. How about you make a truck that’s super cheap and affordable but long lasting like the Japanese did with the Toyota how about you do that instead of overcharge us and create a vehicle that Hass to literally be stuck on the grid have to literally be connected to their system computer so that you can actually access your car every day where is a Toyota with a nice key can start the engine anywhere any time and no computer Hass to be connected. No satellite Hass to be Turned on none of that nonsense. You’re just connected to your car the second the key goes in the ignition with electric vehicles you literally have to always be within driving distance of an electric charging station because you only get as much power as your car batteries will carry. You do not get to have extra battery power in your trunk in a gas can that you can carry around and if you did have extra battery power, it would take up the full size of your trunk just to have enough to have the equivalent of what a gas can could carry , gas is so much more efficient than battery power gas is so much more but it just has so much more potential and the reality is yes we have cars that are 40 mph 40 miles per gallon. I mean type stuff but we can literally have cars that are 150 miles per gallon. Just look Howell  Race bikes and Harleys can get 70 to 100 miles to the gallon Honda bikes can get 100 to 150 miles to the gallon so you just up scale those engines put them in a car and now suddenly cars can get 150 miles to the gallon. We don’t need garbage electric vehicles that  have batteries that we’re out after 10 to 15 years of using them every day a gas powered vehicle can last well over 100 years. If you maintain it you can’t make it the same longevity out of an electric car as of this point so you’re just wasting your money it’s not worth it. !
Where did Elon's evil laugh come from? Now he has an evil laugh to match Jeff Bezo's
Joe Rohan :D
This video fully restored my faith in journalism.
This is the best Cybertruck advertisement ever.
Joes next idea “so I have this rpg” 😂
Drunk Uncles😂
When smart people get high!   Two of my favorite people.
4:00 holy shit was that Elon laughing?
That monstrous evil laught Elon makes when he fails xDD
Why is Elons hand trembling?
😂 elon totally wanted to test this. The moment joe mentioned it hes like "yep lets do it send someone to go get it"😂😂😂
I would be really lucky to have a job working for Tesla and putting the vehicles through a battery of tests to see how tough and durable they can be. That would be an amazing opportunity! I wonder if Telsa will ever decide to make an EV van. I think if they did, they would hit a home run that could stomp out the competition. I have ideas for an EV van with 4x4 capability and endless applications on the functionality of it. Time will only tell, but in my opinion, Tesla has all other car makers on their toes.
“But it does in The cyber truck “😎
If I had what Elon Musk has, I would change the fucking world for the better, tomorrow!!!! Instead he  uses his vast wealth & power to be a douche.
It’s odd to me that they weren’t more concerned about it ricocheting, even if it wasn’t likely. There’s always that chance .
You need a camera guy who knows how to focus on the fly.
How is a fire fighter gonna break you out of your car when it catches on fire, or potentially if you are unconscious at the wheel.
5.56 travels at sub 3,000 FPS, So lets assume you have a 20 inch barrel, it would probably go through, A 50 CAL would destroy it.
Velocity is the armor killer.
could you maybe close your mouth while chewing your gum
The Cybertruck is kinda growing on me.
Ugly as homemade sin, but it's bullet proof.
We need a show of Joe just doing fun stuff in his garage with people
Werner Von Braun "Beware the Elon"...seems like a chill dude though...hmm lol
That is incredibly impressive.
Blah blah blah...talk talk talk.... HOLY CRAP...They are actually doing it!!! I love this!!!!
With starlink installed, bullet proofing, the Cybertruck may be the ultimate zombie apocalypse vehicle since electricity would be easier to produce vs. refined petroleum although diesel is a runner-up.
Oh I just read the other comments you don’t understand this was all fake it was set up 😆 like musk is driving around in that stupid aluminium box 😂
Joe Rohan rides again.
Bro faked us with the Compound Bow 💀
1,125,000 views in 5 hours
U need a good target tip on that arrow for metal penetration. A broadhead will fail everytime. I penetrated both sides of a 44 gal drum with a 60# bow ,carbon arrow, 125g head, no trouble, again with a target tip....Try a Bodkin point. It seems the broadhead splayed on impact transferring the energy all over the place. I have had arrows hit rock and generally the energy will destroy the rear of the arrow as well with the nock blowing off and the shaft splitting. I see the impact being buffered by the flexible broadhead furthermore the lack of damage at the rear of the shaft indicates energy was not flowing inline with the spine of the arrow hence much more potential for penetration in further experiments. Try that target tip guys !   🤔
Impressive!! Broadhead no match
Wow I thought it would go through.. that is a solid truck 😅
Joe cosplaying as his doppleganger for halloween is so fucking funny
Whats up with that He Man haircut
Crazy how comfortable Joe has gotten with Elon. Still remember their first interview when he was wearing that awful pink dress shirt
What's with the blond wig? Did Joe lose a bet?
So you are safe from Indian’s but not until it’s made which will be never and if they do make them they will only make a few and they will be worth stupid money for a stupid car electric vehicle’s are a joke.
ill bet you a dollar
Elon, can I have the truck that Joe Rogan just shot? Please.
Elien
i thought he wwas gonna shoot the glass, still wanna know if you can break it
Who on this planet doesn't like Elon??? I love this guy!
Best Tesla advertising ever!
After a weird and rough day... less than a minute into this video and i am already feeling better. Thank you both for what you do.
Come on joe ur looking like jimmy the nonce
Lmao at Joe dressing up as the meme of himself for Halloween ❤😂
Exactly how stoned are these two??
Elon is awesome!
Imagine what that truck will do to a family of 5 in any other car
All I can hear is some fool chewing gum while they filmed the arrow. Close your mouth!!
Dang dude. No safety glasses? You’re crazy Joe
Why’s it so ugly?
no way hit shot his dudes truck with an arrow. so awsome.
I kinda skipped through to the arrow portion but he was talking about the car being bulletproof. I wonder how he is achieving this. Ceramic plates in the door? Some sort of kevlar?. I know the crown victoria police version has mounts in the doors and trunk for ceramic plates. Maybe hes doing something similar.
If this isnt the most TONY STARK shit then i dont know what is
How long will the battery last lugging around all that weight? How long is it warranted for?
The US Army is probably going to order a few 100.
To whoever buys this thing:  How about you try being a bit nicer. It's a lot cheaper.
As someone who has hand loaded tens of thousands of rounds, ran thousands of rounds through a chronograph, shot darn near every inanimate object imaginable with both firearms and bows, that is damn impressive that his cyber truck flat out deflected a razor sharp broad head arrow from a compound bow!  Elon’s comments of common caliber handgun bullets passing through car doors is spot on. I laugh at every show where they show people hiding behind car doors and being protected from gunfire. Not sure that I, an average law abiding dude several years older than Joe or Elon, really need a bullet proof vehicle but it certainly is cool and I definitely don’t own a bulletproof vehicle. I’d have to say that multiple celebs with deep pockets will now probably want one of these trucks!
I love you Joe and Elon.
Did we really need to hear the camera guy chewing?
1:31 Elon trying to figure out what the worst possible outcome could be. Decides to find out. My kinda guy.
Also broad head is not the ideal tip to use for penetration lol at all
Pay the man his dollar
I bet u a  dollar😂😂😂😂
Elon for president
I’m surprised no one spoke about the arrow ricocheting 🤣
Absolutely amazing! & Beautifully shot Joe ! Lol if it was a buck you had it! but that truck nada Great truck Elon. Cheers! To continued success Boy's!✌🏼💫
It seemed like Elon wanted Joe to shoot his truck with an arrow more than Joe did😂
Why is he wearing a wig 😂
The question is can you get the dent out without replacing the whole panel??
4:03 👱‍♀️🤣🤣🤣🤣
That laugh to rich
Joe you’re a legend for trolling yourself! 😂 Also, please don’t do ad reads, we don’t want you sponsored! If you need more money, there are better ways.
U 2 guys r hands down my favs on Joe’s show! It may have something to do with the interview when Elon said “love is the answer” and Joe reiterated as such! Because it’s ficken true people! How we were put in this fear breeding world is quite the mystery! ❤
Imagine just chilling and Elon says “wanna shoot my car?” 😂
Elon the billionaire: "I bet you a dollar"
Joe Rogan eatin that pizza 🍕 like a true caveman was something else man 😭
target pratice tip go right in it
“Thats impressive”   “Yeah”
He is so right. I got two doors from a junkyard last year and my 9mm went thru both stacked next to each other..
How calm this man can be wearing what he’s wearing is hilarious
Lol Joe not joking with his hunting toys.
Elon is somehow smug as fuck but endearing as hell at the same time
So when are they being released….
Best video on the internet right now
I love it when men get together and turn into little boys the moment they have a weapon and a truck. That was hilarious!  Hope they do more of these!
This and the other Twitter clip clearly display Musk's master plan and ultimate business pivot: he saw the problems Twitter was causing in the US and abroad so he bought it to accelerate the mind virus in the hopes to create a police state where he can sell his cheap bulletproof trucks to the military to ride around the cities fighting crime...
Cowabunga.
The timing is very interesting as well, as tensions rises, elon releases a semi bullet proof car
Evil rich guy laugh
Joe makes that truck look big
and people think Tesla needs to advertise lmao🤣this already has 1,083,869 views as of writing this at 5 hours in!
I don't care what anyone said,  Elon is a fucking legend!
Seems like there would be safety issues with that truck. What if you needed to get someone out in an emergency or accident? Can't even break the glass to get them out.
"bet you a dollar" thats how you make a bet between friends xD
4:45 CNN “First Elon Musk dog whistle to his audience that’s audible” 😂 🙃
Police officer: Sir...what happened to your car? Elon: ...Joe Rogan shot an arrow at it... Police officer: Come on, sir...what really happened to the car?! Elon: He shot an arrow at it! I have the video!...look! 📱
That’s a gentlemen’s bet 🎩
That arrow would penetrate almost all cars, it is very impressive
The biggest failure is the cyber truck
He probably built a bulletproof car because he knows shit is about to hit the fan.
What's up with that wig though?
I bet a 416 Rigby would penetrate
😂😂😂😂what's going on with the wig????
Great clip
Can someone explain to my dumb**s why a cross bow would maybe go through but not a shotgun?
Amazing
It's fucking wild the influence Joe has on Elon lmao. Got him to drink, smoke, and now dress in a costume.
Joe needs to get elon to smoke weed and inhale it this time lol
So He-man became a podcaster?
Two of the most overrated humans on the planet…
Joe lookin like Wally George at the end of video 😂
Elon Musk is the Antichrist. 🙏🏼✝️
Dude i always hated evs but from day one i wanted a cybertruck!
That's a commercial right there for the truck awesome . Can add arrows that will not penetrate the doors too lol
Shoutout to the camera man absolutely GOING TAH TAHN on that gum
Joe dressed up as part of “Team Rubio” is hilarious 😂🤣💀
It's nice of He-man to step in for Joe
Joe s hammered.
Elon should sell his laugh to Disney for $44B
i hate whoever that was chewing gum behind the camera.
This truck is gonna plaster any of these pos cars made today if in a accident
Joe should of  signed the car
Impressive
Never thought this would be a conversation 😂 Glorious
Hey Joe!! Shoot it at the "armored" windows
Elon sounds like lex luthor when he laughs... Fukkin evil and funny at the same time 😂
This IS America.  Discussing ballistic values of weapons against an object 😂
At 1:22 Ping trip is tumescent  Although the wig might be an issue for editing
You know elon had the same evil laugh when buyin twitter
Too bad he never made a truck you could haul hay with .   Who cares if its  a drag racer
Joes a trans-woman ?
Skip to 3:00 to see arrow clip
lol
Did the worlds richest man just issue a gentlemans bet? ($1 bet) 😂😂😂
I guess Joe's Masters of the Universe name would be Bow-Man.
If you are a drill rapper, or a gang member etc, owning one of these is a no brainer. I'm sure Elon may have thought of this also 😂
Elon reminds me of my autistic cousin, I swear he's on the spectrum. Some of those guys can be super smart but weird as hell
What's the repair cost on that?
Matthew 13:18-23 18 Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. 19 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side. 20 But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; 21 Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. 22 He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. 23 But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty
I love that Joe thinks a f250 weighs that much different than a f350, oh and they are about 2000lbs lighter lol than cyber truck. Not bashing cyber truck everyone or believed Joe
lol he shot that sh!t with a broad head
YouTube and IG / Facebook are just as bad as Old twitter . 100% pro palastinian. Anyone who post pro Israel comments gets banned . Or atleast comment removed . They also limit any media from Israel . Very one sided biased control
But can’t defend baseballs
These guys just way past Cool, Awesome job guys.  Tks..
Elon is incredibly chill and humble, yet exudes confidence.
f250 is 10k pounds. Betya  this cybertruck comes with some sort of remote shut off capability for police. Crimal shooting out the window at officers, officers bullets aint coming back in.
Life must be a dream for Joe, with his nose so firmly embedded in Elon;s asscrack.
I love to see these people together talking and have crazy ideas.
That African-American dude dodged the hamas question as fast as that arrow from Joe's bow.
Mad max car
Police are gonna buy these by the dozen
Joe dressing up as the baseball fan with a blonde wig is why I love him. Never takes himself seriously, open minded, logical in his thinking, and a sense of humor.
This is the free talk us men live and need in a world full of softies 😂
its a gimmick. unless the door panels and windows are rated to stop rifle bullets it's not really bulletproof.
Elon, buddy, pal, hook a brother up with a free Cybertruck... 😂
Should have used a practice arrow with a solid end, not a broadhead
Best episode. These two together are just both rational and intelligent.
That is not Joe Rogan, that's He-Man Rogan
Since doing more podcasts I’ve noticed he’s become a lot more comfortable with long form talking like this. If you go back and watch his first pod with joe it’s awkward at times and he seems a bit nervous
7k lbs? That's it? WOW  That's light for an armored electric truck.
Hanging with a wig on, drinking whiskey and smoking a good cigar, life's just fine. Two dudes just chilling. I love it :) Every time the camera pans to Joe I just crack the f' up. I'm dyin here, he's killin me...🤣hey cutie lmfao
Jre is the best podcast on earth and in human history 💯🤝FACT this is the only person Joe Rogan on earth who has ever lived through human history that has been able to have ae place where people from all over the world think about how big the earth is and how many people there are and who's the most interesting most intelligent most high valueind blowing information unheard off knowledge unheard off experiences that people from all over the world come to this one human being to Joe Rogan 😮🎉 first time in human history this has and probably will ever happen and happened Joe Rogan your ae human gold hearted important masculine scollar discifill, student, teacher,son,grand son, uncle,great grand uncle, father, grandfather,wizard,nobble,modest,strong,tough,can fight,knows grabbling,can protect,does provide,came from being broke,Joe Rogan love you brother I'm all the way from new Zealand I was an alcoholic loser but jre, Andrew Tate,Jordan Peterson,fresh and fit,keven Samuels all saved my life and change it Respect 💯💰🤝💵🎏💙💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨💨plus weed helps😂😂😂
Hahahaha  Joe trying to look like one of Elon's bitches.
We need Joe to play  He-Man in a live action
Trucks are supposed to be tough.
Joe looks ridiculous lol
They should use that (Joe shooting the arrow and nothing happens) in a commercial for the CyberTruck. Seems like it would be a selling point.
Joe looks like a literal cartoon.
Why is Rogan dressed up like Jimmy saville?
Elon and joe are the heros we need.
Am I seeing things?? Why is no one talking about the wig XD
have Joe Rogan & Elon Musk sign the the door and clear coat it. I'll buy the door for $1,000. I'll have to be there to see it for authentication of course.  that's one of the coolest demonstration I've seen. great show.  keep em coming.
Elon don’t play boyyyy
4:00 lmao
Is that Prince Adam's hairpiece on Joe? Ya know, hold the sword aloft, say the words, and now he's He-Man?
Just woke up from a dream and watched this, its like an extension of my dream 😅
best duo ever lol
I could listen to Elon and Joe podcasts all day long!
Chewing gum?
the seriousness joe talks about ,,, but that wig hahahaha
Also Rogan ask musk where his test hyperloop went to that was near Tesla hq? Ripped apart for the metal cuz it’s a fucking dream! Look what hd gave people in Vegas! The loop is 35 miles an hour and literally got backed up before! He can’t even get his own cars to drive automatically in his own place he made for them! You people suck
Wait: did he reinvite Musk in 2023 no way XDDDD Is Joe delirious, Musk is demasked as a Snake oil salesman left and right XDDDD lmao, will love to see this all unfold
Loved this episode, but for the love of effing god don’t eat into the goddamn mic. It sounded beyond disgusting.
Is elon acoustic
Good Lord, what is that revolting sound in the parking garage??  Is the cameraman chewing like some sort of multi-row teethed monster?? 🤮🤮🤮
Dude that’s why I love these guys. When I’m shooting my bow I’m like I wonder if this would go through the cyber truck. And now I know but I for sure could piece up a rivian
How would the repairability be
Now that’s a bet! One dollar. Who’s that jackass that wanted to bet and Joe said he has nothing worth his time or something. Lmao.
Elons back
This episode is amazing
*Joe fires arrow at truck, barely dents it*  Joerg Sprave: "Hold my beer."
I cant believe im seeing this right now 😂
Rambo cross bow would take out the cybertruck... no problem..
Cybertruck’s bouta be the hood car.
you just gotta love elon musk ..
@baseballdoesntexist
Legend
3:54 I'm not the only one thinking Musk looks like he's dressed as a pimp in this...
I'd like to know what cigars they smoke
And this is why I like and respect Elon Musk. Just another guy next door who happens to be a genius billionaire.
they are just bros now
THE CYBERTRUCK WAS ANNOUNCED IN LIKE 2017 and said it could drive on it own and the a ball cracked the windows. Musk just tells people stuff that’s why he said I don’t want to give too much away cuz there is nothing right now!! How do you all have brain worms and I actually found a YouTube video of the first ever removal of a brain worm so pls go get all your removed cuz first off Rogan has lost his mind and isn’t a super man like you all think. I love how the poorest people look up to people who got like 100 million dollar deals to sit and just talk! The people making these cars in China over 600 million of their residents make 150 dollars a month!!! The 2nd in command who just “died” somehow cuz he was actually liked by people! So it’s disgusting how any of you can say anything cuz first your ignorance knows no bounds cuz you truly think telsa who makes 4% of cars if that, somehow his company is worth 20x what other huge car companies that make far more cars than musk ever could! I’ll bet you within 5 years musk will have basically bankrupted himself why do you need a 13billion dollar loan for Twitter when he bought it if he has 225 billion! He doesn’t have anything so when Tesla crashes and goes to 10% of what it is. I’m just going to laugh and say I told you so!
Pretty sure my 2004 Lexus door would do the same thing…
That truck has the worse head space ever. Who the hell want that bullsh*t?
What a cool way to promote cyber truck  This impromptu action promote cyber truck more than any kind of legacy way of advertising
The camera guy... spit out the gum or stop smacking. In the garage
In a full vesion Musk evades hamas and taliban themes like a 5 yeah old kid with his lalala I don't hear you. Dude this shit is screams ruzzian money :D
Joe owes Elon a 💵.
These two are toasted 😂
"yeh, go shoot my new truck"  what a boss
Dumb and Bummer.... Zero penetrations
Joe sitting with a reptilian
How do you not sell these to criminals? 5:59
My first time watching a video of Elon I'm to be the first millionaire in my family
lol "I bet you a dollar" elon with the real high stakes
Elon is definitely fing 😎😎😎😎 cool
Elon: Dude, you wanna shoot my truck with an arrow?!   Joe: Right now?! Let’s go!
Joe Roe,Elon musk and a Camel with a Camera go dam could barely hear anything over the gum chewing
Speed defeats armour, not weight
same results with a hilus lol
It is epic!!!
science bitches
With such a tough vehicle are you not worried about things like the lack of crumple zones, the damage you will do to pedestrians and other vehicles as well as how hard it will be for fire rescue to get into the vehicle?
ya boi needs a camera with a manual focus lens
hey cutie
That was an idiotic stunt.  That truck looked like it was begging to ricochet into a bystander.
Elon should know that even going through a door, a bullet will be deflected and lose energy.
Man that arrow would have gone clean through a tyranasoreass but it couldn't ding a tesla
Women: I wonder what he's thinking about right now Men thinking: see video
Who's the clown chewing the gum so loud while holding the camera ?
@ 7000 lbs with a good size load in it , you may have to stop at weigh stations!
I genuinely thought this was a deepfake parody for the first 6 minutes.
Her: I bet he's thinking about other women.  Joe: Tries to Shoot an Arrow Into the CyberTruck.
That's so funny joes dressed up as the guy who looks like him. Every time the camera is on him and he talks I can't help but laugh
😂😂 I bet you a dollar
Hey cutie
I will never trust Elon. The dude has consistently lied so often about everything for so long.
Bunch of millionaires and the moment is filmed with an iPhone 3 or some shit
Elon knows how to design and build them.   Love it!!!    You go Elon!!
For Frodo.
I'm just glad this moment exists in the universe
Boys Will Be Toys
Damnit Joe. Now I'm going to have to save for one of those 😒.
Reckless as fuck, arrow head nearly hit the camera man.
i gotta watch this whole podcast in a sec love the puerto rico rep /costume lmao
I’ll bet you a dollar…..Trading Places 😂
shit man where was this truck 200 years ago? 💀💀
1,000,000 views in 3 hours congrats man! That's better than national news coverage 😆
''you wana do it right now?'' the same guy: yeah lets do it right now the other dude: yeah bro!
I would do the same thing with that money.  But he is making it available to all.
Was the cameraman eating ass while he was recording Joe with the bow?
Dude elon is just a fun ass billionaire idk why people hate him he literally does things because he thinks its cool what more can you ask for im not looking for him to solve world hunger or anything like that thats HIS money i just enjoy watching him build cool ahit
Where’s that dollar
we are witnessing history
What a relief. I've driven through many a bad area where you see people walking down the streets with arrows knoched in bows just looking for an excuse to unload the quiver. Glad to know I'll be safe if I buy the Tesla truck.
Effing legends. Both of them.
Will go down as one of the all time great Rogan vids. 10/10 😅
Jamie chomping on his gum, dang boy chill out
When Mexican drug cartels get a hold of these it’s over for Mexico

go throw a steel sphere
You see distorts history
Tesla stock just went ^  straight to the moon!
man joe aged rough as shit
Who is ancient civilization
They will open your eyes
This whole episode was AI generated.
Now Joe what the hell made you think a razor tip could beat a piece of lead flying at over 900 fps?!?
These two together is great, wtf is Joe's wig
So you're saying this truck is going to kill lots of people in accidents on the road.
Invite Abhijeet Chavda
Elon smoking while watching Joe shoot at his car with an arrow is the funniest thing. Such a boss. xD
Elon just yeah go send someone to get it.    Talking the talk. Walking the walk.
I have always wondered if an arrow could penetrate a cyber truck door.  Now I know
Invite Praveen Mohan
Girls: He is probably cheating on me!  Boys: **Shoots arrows on expensive truck**
Mr Joe you are living in the illusion
That arrow would have went all the way thru an f150
Please invite Praveen Mohan on your show
Whiskey, woman and you know what else fellas. Congrats Happy Halloween
"I'll bet you a Dollar" the richest man in the world-
Can you Invite Praveen Mohan
This is probably one of the most Joe Rogan conversations ever.
Yo the thumbnail is hilarious
''I'll bet you a dollar''-elon musk
Cameraman chewing gum made me want to rip my ears off
Joe in that wig lol... happy Halloween all 😊
Im surprised Elon wasn't smoking an E-cogar
Somebody call the Ranch Fairy...
Joe for the Heman movie.
4:03😂
Elon is such a down to mars guy!
Elon and Joe Show
Joe chose this podcast to wear a blonde wig and I can’t take a thing either of them says seriously because of it
That will be Safe truck in collision...    all that ENERGY is transferred into passengers  🤣🤣.   There's a reason why all modern cars have "crumbling" front and back ..which absorb that energy from collision ..   that's the reason why modern cars is much more safe than cars from 50-80s
Why the wig? 0:39
3:35  California would not have approved the absences of eye pro.
It's funny not seeing elon  doing his normal nod he does when he makes a point at the end of his statement
This camera man needs to be fired, dude be chewing something really loud...
I've become less of a fan of each over the last five yrs but watching this was pure entertainment
That truck was built for the coming zombie apocalypse 😆 but you just need to make sure you have a gas or diesel generator to charge it 🤣
If you open your cybertruck door into another car in the parking lot that thing is toast lol.
Jamie take the gum out when you film 😂
Joe has good form
dented the fuck outta it
'but it does in the Cybertruck'  <3 mate brought the A-Team back to life fr
Happy Halloween!
Great vid :)...Now comparison to bullets.
why the wig?
Wow. ❤❤❤ the arrow is gone 🎉🎉🎉
Truly epic
well this made my day
Elon is way more comfortable compared to the first one. Love this podcast
That's cool.
Joe mad little lmao
Elon is most kool.  hey shoot an arrow at mybtruck
Omfg the best one yet😂
That's the MOST American way to Chew Gum!  Goodness gracious man! 🤢
Could someone please explain the absurd Rick Flair-esque wig.  He looks like ld draw down on him if I saw him on my property.  No offense......
@3:36, 🏹💥🛻 nice👍👍
those are big blunts they are smoking
The title is so badass pol
I can’t believe no one wore eyewear 😂
What is up with the wig?
only Elon would be so modest to say i may be driving home with an arrow stuck in my truck
i shot my load into a sock today so what
Now what happens when that truck hits a Ford focus at 70mph?
That's why in the hood when bullets start flying you get behind the engine block
Fucking rich people.....that was awsome, and it justifies spend $80k on a truck
JRE clip where theyre not in the studio for the whole thing is fucking nuts
Nikola Tesla converted the "Pierce Arrow" into an electric car.  Joe Rogan, the first to try and pierce a Tesla electric car, with an arrow.
I have the power!!
💯💯💯
Man I love these two men how entertaining man wow
best shirt ever
These two GENTLEMEN are LIVING THE LIFE 💪😂👍
Holy shit batman! That arrow, from that range, can go clean through both shoulder blades of a black bear.
getting ready for the stone age or what
Has anyone actually ever seen a CyberTruck on the road in person? I just feel almost like it's all a big scam. I live in a big city and have never seen one.
I'm so proud of they for being they true self. Let us know your pronouns and name if you changed it. I'm so euphoric right now!
What a fucking legend these 2 dudes are
_Why_ is he dressed as Jimmy Saville!?
i dont think there's tabacco in the cigars...
The quality of the vehicle & technology Elon DO is the BEST worth for your money AGAINST to those supposedly (OLIGARCHS) WHO BEEN in "the business" for decades but decided "NOT TO DO IT PROPERLY A SLOW UPGRADES EVERY NOW AND THEN FOR THEIR PRODUCT FOR THE SAKE OF GREED"
I'm blown away by this, a CEO of one of the biggest companies just went with Joe's suggestion of shooting an arrow at the cybertruck... I wanna know how many lawyers of his legal team had collective heartattacks.
I would’ve been afraid of taking that shot without some armor
Will It Survive a 50 cal sniper?? This video is pure gold!  talented and engaging, they definitely deserve a permanent position in the podcasting world.
Joe saville
Top 10 pod ever for 100 reasons.
Epic lol
2 legends bless us with yet another podcast how lucky are we 👏🏻👌🏻
The fucken wig.!! That’s the only reason I’m here.!!
Joe: "Thanks for coming on" Elon: "Let's go shoot my truck"
This thumbnail goes hard
Call me a square but I don't necessarily want a "indestructible" truck like I want a chance to be rescued in a bad spot.
This whole thing is so wild, I honestly thought this was AI generated at first 😅
“Is your truck bulletproof?” No, and yours isn’t either because your vital organs are behind regular glass, you morons. What demo are they trying to reach here? Mentally disabled, beater Nissan Altima driving, low-level gangsters, with $100k burning a hole in their pockets, and only want 1/2 their body protected? There must be at least 3 of those those people.
try a 140 grain field point. Broadhead soaked up the energy.
This is the best podcast ever!!!
You guys need to post the sardines clip 😂
Elon musk is a dork pretending to be a nerd
Elon is the goat
Seeing Joe in a blond wig and a PR baseball jersey is the funniest thing in the world!
Imagine having Joe Rogan and Elon Musk as bois..  "What do you want to do today?"  "Shoot rockets at the Cyber Truck?"  "Sounds good, bet you a dollar it blows up!"  "Bet"
How would you prove robot has consciousness using empirical data? How do you prove to blind man what color red is using empirical data? In theory, robot can be programmed to move its hand when it touches hot surface. How do I know its having the experience of hot using test tube(Deduction/induction)? The only thing i am certain of is that i have experience of hot. This experience(“Cogito Ergo Sum”) can only come from entity that can already experience infinite attributes of existence (Allah-one/indivisible/All-Loving/Self-Sufficient Perfection)
How about people listen to the many pissed of Tesla owners who can’t get service centers to honor the Tesla warranties?  Make that priority
Seriously, how are the body shops going to repair a dent like that?  This is cold rolled steel.  You can't just put a glue stick on it and pull it out.
Behind the scenes Elong : Don't aim at the window.. Joel : Don't you think that's what the customers mainly concerned about.. Elong : Do you want to shoot the car or not?
Safety glasses people!
That spark tho! 😂
Great comments.
Gum chomping is horrendous
Like 2 kids who are both geniuses in their own right with extra large bank accounts to fund whatever their hearts and minds desire. Who wouldn't want to hang out with these two. 😂
There's going to be a lot of cyber trucks  flattening other cars in car accidents. 😂
Why is Joe like a He-Man?🤣
I'm sure this is not the whole interview just wondering about the wig. Did Joe loose a bet?
I was waiting for one of them to bring up buttered sausages...maybe next time then.
Truck still looks dumb.
😂 this was great. Elon has a dent in his car now! 😅
2:15 Crossbow bolts are lighter? Man video games have done it again! I was convinced theyre bigger purely from gaming
Why didn’t he shoot the window?
Ya if you test out bullets I gotta see that!
cameraman chewing the fuck out of that gum
Are we ignoring the chewing in the mic?!? 😂😂😂
CAN'T WAIT TO GET MY CYBERTRUCK!!!! 💪🏼🤪👍🏻🇺🇲
100% rich kid stuff, lol
When did joe grow his hair out?!
In defence of the A-Team, their van was made from level 4 tacticool.
That was impressive but man who the hell was chewing gum, recording the video so annoying
no safety glasses
Saw the thumbnail and thought this was an AI generated vid. Why's the dude wearing a wig
Phenomenal. Just...wow...
They are turning into Texans " I bet I can put a whole in your new truck, shit hold my bong and beer lol
When there is an episode where they smoke one, its literally like all the other videos but with a x0.75 speed🤣
3:10 Jesus that chewing is unbearable
I’d like to see how it does against intermediate rifles. If the bullet spawls but goes through: then a little soft armor inside would stop the frag. If it goes through solid a secondary plate would stop it. I’d love one of these trucks.
Joe’s costume 😭
Looking more like patty the fatty😂
Joe's first science experiment ! Love this kinda thing
Wig = they made Joe their b. FF.
You autograph that dent  joe Rogan and you could sell that truck for a pretty penny, and donate it, or not  SECONDLY mr musk can you build me a custom wheelchair 😁🤷🏽
3:02 Jesus Christ could that camera man chew his gum any louder
Joe looks AWESOME with hair
Hawkeye and Batman meet IRL
Cyberjunk that no one (with an ounce of sense) wants!
Biggggg Jimmy Saville vibes with the hair and the cigar 😂
holy sht this is amazing.  I need a cyber truck.
Lmfao
please invite Elon Musk and Neil De Grass Tyson to talk about space, human future, environment, etc..
Joe makes an extremely ugly trans person.
wrong! BA always bulletproofed the rig
Cant wait until someone LS swaps or cummins swaps one.
Elon is so chill
Whoever was holding the camera for the demonstration was chewing extremely loudly
Soooo they are just real normal people just like us…….
All I’m looking at is that PUERTO RICO baseball jersey
Awesome
YouTube comments and likes are messed up wth is going on?
Soooo… it’s  like an F250 that you can’t haul anything out of town with. But you can shoot your own truck if that helps. As long as you don’t shoot at the windows, where your vital organs, (including the brain) are located.
Joe would eat Elons shit if he told him to
I'm excited to get mine.  I'd take the one Joe potato head Rogan dented.
Congrats ladies and gentlemen, we now have the video equivalent of what it means to be a man. Build something with high tech machinery and then have your best friends try to shoot an arrow through it. We worked our way out of the sticks just for this moment 😂...
No safety glasses, no PPE, just Elon.
Joe looks like He Man with a tshirt
He wearing the Rican jersey I love it 😂🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
How does Elon look at you normally, holy shit that wig 😂😂😂
Yeah! Montec CARBON STEEL broadheads.!   I don't use anything else. They are insane tough. I'm so impressed with the truck. I have put a practice tip into a 16th in plate steel at 100 yards.  It was a whoopsy but still. If it stops thoes arrows and bullets. I feel like the police need to make some changes to the way they protect themselves. I think that everything a police officer uses maximizes there safety including there cars. Which are apparently made from tin foil and hope.
Lmao.. they really left studio midway to go shoot the shxt.. 😂 best
Joe looking kinda sexy with the wig…ngl 👽
This is why I watch podcasts. This right here
😂🤣🫵🤘🤩
I'd like to go to work with Elon and then hangout with Joe after work
I missed something. Rogan lose a bet?
Joe can you pull 80 or the 90 sitting in a stand W0W 👍
No one like Elon Musk ever
What an idiot. The ricochet could have killed him.
Why don't you guys push the idea of investing in stock locally to the world? Rather than stick with me and run with it, or funding someone's presidential campaign through stock across the nation all because of your videos or somebody else's during a tough time to the viewers. I think there's growth and more names made
All praise be to Joe and Elon, icons of a generation.
Sparks and everything!!
best rogan episode EVERRRRRRRR
Joe wearing the Puerto Rico baseball jersey got me in tears 😂
This went up 30k views during the first 30 seconds I was watching
So what are the body panels made of???
Balla shhh!!!
On one hand, this is terrific marketing for his vehicle and just fun that it seemed to have come up spontaneously.  ...but on the other hand I can't help but see the dystopia in this. That being bulletproof is part of a mass market vehicle's marketing. That's almost some RoboCop shit. XD
Hahahaha whats with the jimmy savile fit...
This was a fun interview,  thank you Elon for taking away the governments over reach on speech.  You're right about San Francisco,  I live near there, born in the bay area 1982.  Liberal policies have decimated my state. It's too expensive here and crime is out of control
Might be a dumb question but I’m not a hunter. If a gun is not going to penetrate the vehicle, why would we think an arrow could penetrate the vehicle?
Cast Rogan as He-Man !
Epic
That is so fucking cool!!!
OK, I was just going to get another Ford, but considering how many gunfights I get into Elon is making me totally rethink that. Really, until now I've simply been lucky that my opponents and I all use cap guns, but if that ever changes it'll be time to upgrade to a CyberTruck for sure.
basically, a sales pitch for military, law enforcement and 2nd amendment devotees!
NGL, that was fucking cool
this had me laughing so hard!! amazing
PUERTO RICO!!!!!🎉🎉🎉
Who’s gonna invade the us if everyone’s driving around in these mfs
That's some tough stainless steel bebe
I think that Joe seriously thought that his arrow was going to penetrate that door with ease.
Karen Joe
Damn...Jeff Besos would have said: 20min,I just ordered you a new one.😂
Can the truck defeat the power of Rome?  Gladius>Pillum>Ballista
Elon the goat 🚀
Maaan... i got nervous when he had that bow drawn. I feel like that could've ricocheted right back at him or someone else.
Great liberals will want to ban this truck especially in CA because you cant even buy body armor
Jamie violating my ears with that gum smacking
Ok I need to know, who is Joe Rogan for Halloween? Lol
love thisssss
Try a bodkin instead of broadhead
This is not trending?
Who is Joe Rogan?
Joe took the wig off for the bow excursion 😆
That truck is probably an apocalypse prepper's dream car
These two are great friends😂
Joe’s costume is retired He-man.
Try hitting the windows 🤣
I love the “let’s do it right now” people.
Use a bodkin arrow not a broadhead. Bodkins are made to punch through plate armour. Broadheads are hunting arrows.
When is the Tesla tank coming out?
4:00 Elon’s laugh 😳😳😳
Whoof.  Joe is *not* a good looking woman.
That cigar right now,kay
That laughter of Elon after the arrow 😂❤
looking like rick flair lol
Barely a scratch. Now let's get the repair cost.
The aliens back to the podcast smoking cigar
Wow what a podcast lol
We got 3 foot 8 Joe Rogan shooting a arrow at the cybertruck meanwhile Elon just watching and smoking a cigar 🤣
This is what I love about the internet.
It’s sad but buying a bullet proof car in modern America is probably not a bad idea
Below 3 seconds 7k pounds. Yeah this womt be running people over accidentally
It would have been better without the annoying gum chewing ASMR mukbang in the background 🤢😒
Joe in a blond wig  sat opposite Elon smoking a cigar just cracks me up, love it!
Is it me or should Joe be the next HE-MAN!
Damn. camera man was ON  that gum. He tried to spice it up with a little  ASMR😂
This is the most texas boy thing I've seen all day.
He-Man?
Been waiting on those trucks for years. Don’t know anyone who has seen one on the road.
Bantam weight amateurs
Actually Badass 😂
I got shot with a hoytt Maxxis 70lb blunt tip in the leg ... Took it like a man! Almost died and still have a scar no big deal
JRE tests show that Cyber Trucks will get you through a war unscathed... 🏹
the guy smacking on gum behind the cam makes me want to blow my brain out but sick video nonetheless
Elon should have bet him $1 Billion, then said, “I forgot, you’re not a billionaire”.
You need heavier arrows because the surface tension in the stainless steel will essentially treat anything less than the minimum weight as a glorified rubber ball, that said joe rogan science experiments are crazy entertaining, i feel like ive stolen this quality of entertainment for what is essentially free.
"I'll bet you a dollar"😂
Is Joe supposed to be Little Lotta in that wig?
Joe you’re a builder. We wanna see that beautiful machine in a Catapult  A nice silver bullet if I fall off a cliff will I live ? Catapult
The Tesla truck literally broke when they threw a rock at it hahahah
Elon put Tesla in Forza again 🩶
That was just the best
This is how millionaire boys play
WTF IS GOIN ON HERE. Is that a dead tweety bird on joe’s head?
Cyber Truck: 1 Joe Rogan: 0
Wake up, Peoples!! PROOF!!  HAIR GROWTH IS A SIDE AFFECT OF HORSE MEDS!!!
Guys need/have any pest control there?
Joe turns and shoots tire😂
The inner mouth sounds in the garage made me puke.  Take your headphones out,  fair warning
elon musk, the gift we all needed.
s'up with the wig? Halloween?
Back when Elon toked on Joe's joint I wrote about it to High Times Magazine and they published me
I think Joe is wrong about arrows versus crossbow bolts penetrating steel. There is a reason why crossbows replaced bows for combating heavily armored knights
Joe hungover he man Rogan
Should have used a bobber head arrow. They are designed to penetrate armor.
Elon is such a down to mars guy!
I watched the whole pod and Joe never paid Elon his dollar
You need to hire a new camera man 🤣
These dudes are so dang cool! This is dude's dude talk! Love it!
That arrow shot was incredibly reckless. I’m glad no one caught a ricochet. That was so badass though 😂
Omg listening to these two guys is like wandering into some stoners apartment with game consoles and spilled bongs and empty pizza boxes - except they are some of the richest most popular and powerful people on earth.   This is why I fear for humanity.
I bet the CIA uses Elon to do all kinds of shit. The feds and CIA have infiltrated just about every profession. If he's not, I bet there's ppl at his company that do.
This alone helped drive the stock up about $5. Which is billions for elon
Joe with the softball BS for Elon
Rogans costume is nightmare fuel lol  .i cant take the wig ,put that shit on a t shirt
Joe you owe Elon a $1
joe, a plain jane 9mm ball round will travel around 1000 to 1200 fps. You should look into FBI Ballistics testing. For penetration you want smaller faster rounds, not bigger and slower.
Such a badass convo
Just a couple of bad assess hanging out shooting the shit. I love you bro's.
Rogans a moron. He really thinks a lot of himself.
Elon’s laugh is the wildest shit ever lol
The camera man just Givin' er with the gum 🤣
Is is the most Rogan JRE episode I’ve seen in awhile.
Dude, that was awesome. Elon and ROGAN ARE GANGSTERS😂.
Come on Joe u know Elon truck is the ultimate hardbody why do u think he bet u a million dollars he was sure but was still impressive to see
Bro the shooting of the cyber truck is dangerous asf 😂
Hey I thought Joe was the chick from Blondie. Lol   Debi Hary is it?
Great content and the shirt Bad Ass 🎉🎉🎉 Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 Puñeta
You might want to shoot at an angle 😄
I guess in the USA ypu definitely need a bullet proof Mad Max style truck. They both look stoned, i wonder if they smoking blunts.
hahahah elon watching joes attemp to shoot an arrow through his designed cybertruck while puffing a cigar is kinda iconic xD
So bizarre but brilliant 😂
What we learned in this video: Jamie can't get shit in focus.
So basically real life bat mobile
Hiding behind a car door probably worked up to the 60s when cars were made of thicker metal and most everyone had a .32, 38, or shotguns.
Wow such a motivating vehicle. Thanks Elon. Nice bow Joe 💘
Take cover behind the engine block if you have no other cover...
Thats why Joe exists....to do this stuff. Priceless..... absolutely.
This is fuckn gnarly!
elon looks like some European pimp
Joe with that wig on makes me wanna vote for him. Lmao
Advanced AI project+ this, elon is 1: trying to create optimus prime or 2: become iron man!
🇵🇷🇵🇷🇺🇸🇺🇸
Who’s smacking their gum into the mic like a clueless moron?
But if you put on the aircon it kills the battery 😂
No, because Im from South Africa.
Joe looks like Joe Walsh with the wig lol
Just Sooooooo Cool!!!!   The Cybertruck, Elon, and Joe!!!
Rohan’s Halloween costume is fire, what a wicked sense of humour, I love how he blows the weed smoke into Elon, you know he’s trying to get Elon major high
It's weird that Joe doesn't know that much about crossbows and what they can do.  It's like he doesn't like em or something lmao.  But hey he knows his compound bows forsure.
Joe looks like at any minute he could yell "it's MA'AM!!"
Bro really made his truck BLM proof. Thank u for keeping us safe from the terrorists
is that jamie smacking his gum?
This whole thing is wonderful
hopefully the cartels dont get a bunch of these fkn
Joe debating the physics of crossbows with Elon Musk.  Gotta love it.
We need more Elon on the podcast.
Elon has definitely been working on his evil laugh. It’s getting more intense
Shoulda kept the wig on, Joe...woulda gone through!
Where’s the longest version of this podcast
These two guys are awesome I can watch them both talk for hours
Jamie pull up that clip of the polar bear fighting the cyber truck
Hnmm would a sword do anything to it
Did shooting that arrow blow his wig off from impact ot does his bald head look like he's got a blonde wig on from a distance? Or am I just drunk?
I love seeing these two bounce ideas off each other. Awesome idea to do a live demonstration. It's entertaining and comes off as a simple conversation between two friends
Jamie! Take the damned candy out your mouth!
Jo dressed as Jimmy Saville 😂
I hope people don't get all stupid and start vandalizing other people's Cyber trucks just to see what will happen 🤞🏾🤞🏾
Girlfriend: " *He's probably out flirting with other girls.* " Me and the guys at 1AM:
Amazing truck! If I have $$$ I'll buy one, for sure!!!!
Sometimes I don’t know if it’s a ping trip
A 230 grain .45 going 1100 feet a second wouldn't penetrate it but Joe goes " a 270 grain arrow at 300 foot a second will definitely do it". Elon knew he wasn't losing that dollar bet and even tried to explain the math. On the other hand, Joe got to shoot a truck with a bow for a dollar. I know money isn't everything but it definitely seems  more fun.
Joe seems to be easygoing. It seems Elon is the same. Just to guys kicking it being guys
How is elon not in tears at joes wig lmao
I feel like this is like, "Guess is it," "rich man, poor man." Man shoot arrow at buddies car. It could go either way. Lol
Joe: "Can I have my bear bite it?"
Joes Alec Baldwin moment
Hahahahahahaha no way he dressed up as that meme
My crossbow shoots 500 grain bolts. 400 grain bolt, 100 grain tip
Protected from small-calibre bullets/ricochets, no paintjob to key, and angles that makes it easy to hose it off after you get back to the compound, plus a good ground clearance. You can't convince me that he didn't design this to be a California-proof car.  Seeing as he moved to Texas though, I'm guessing there won't be any more models like this.
Musk is such a huge grifter but you just cant help liking listening to him
Elon is super chill
If someone was talking to me the Elon talks I would think there slow or something is wrong with them but they say he is smart.or if he was a cars salesman he would be horrible ppl buy his because he makes it look bad azz so ppl don't need the go getter swag talk just make cool shit and ppl will buy it
Two crazy rich guys doing crazy rich guy shit.
I have 2.6sec best,0-60 on my v6 challenger
Yo this was awesome…Elon and Joe are the dopest
Every rapper alive needs a cyber truck 🤣🤣
this is the fourth time. an elon visit should be a semi annual thing. ELON, dont do those worthless interviews with reporters and whatnot who dont even ask a single good question.  this podcast is way better .
That wig 🔥🤌🤣
Massive ad. Thanks, but no thanks
Men are so hansome until they put on a wig. Really funny him being supremely male while discussing alpha male stuff.  I wonder if Mike or Alex could pull this off.
Jamie pull up that video of a bear taking an arrow and blocking it
What the fuck is joe wearing
These two are fun together! 😂🤣
Musk always sounds like there's a continuous conversation going on in his head and he has to interrupt it in order to speak.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
elon is 100% alien , but so down to earth. great show guys
Why is joe wearing the wig and the PR baseball jersey ? 😂😂
3:02 - OMG fire that camera man, he has no skill. Can't keep a shot steady or in focus. Yeesh!
3:13 Elon's bodyguard looking at him like "you sure this Joe Rogan guy isn't gonna try to shoot you with that bow and arrow?"
Brando Vibes
I’d buy a CyberTruck with Dogecoin! Dogecoin to the moon!!!
I have 2 tri motors ordered. I can't wait.
Really don’t ever wanna crash into a cybertruck
Clicked thinking that was a metaphor.  Wasn't expecting him to literally shoot an arrow at it 😂
The thing to take note is it sparked on impact , nonferrous materials such as stainless are not supposed to make sparks so there is some kind of ferrous nonferrous allow in the metal for the door very interesting
That's a weird ass quiver.
That bald guy suddenly grew hair. 😮
Wtf, which interview is this? Number???
LOL, Joe's podcast never fails to entertain.
Joe pretending that truck was a dear
Best commercial for the truck lol
The truck looks like it was drawn by a child. Elon is still immense, though.
What's cooler? Being Elon Musk and getting to tell people the dent in your truck is from where Joe Rogan shot it with a bow? OR, being Joe Rogan and telling people the broken arrow mounted above your fireplace is from shooting your bow at Elon Musk's truck?
But what if they shoot you getting out the truck
The wealthy might need bullet proof vehicles if they keep milking the economy for every cent. Raising prices and paying low wages. They are creating a impovershed economy. Which means more desperate people and higher gun violence.  Ultimately though they are screwing themselves. Raise prices to where nobody can afford anything and pay low wages at the same time. The big 3 cant even sell vehicles to their own employees. Idk how they think they can get rid of low cost vehicles and make their average prices over 50k and sell vehicles. 😕 like maybe 20% of the population can afford 1k dollar car notes. They are pricing themselves out of buisness.
Elon musk is such a bad ass human just like joe rogan.
what happened to Rogan's face?  He looks so old and wrinkled; he is not that old
What do you mean Flash Gordon approaching? Open fire!
Elon saying “hey cutie” then laughing like that with whiskey in his hand is so iconic 😂😂😂😂
What in the Internet is happening? When real discussions are like this, Do we need AI? Really?
Joe looking like rick flair in that wig
Chewing gum...gross
who is that guy filming the clip and vigorously chewing gum like a teenage girl. Idk it just bothers me coudln't enjoy the clip enough
Just ❤these two they should do a monthly meet.. “hey cutie” 😂
Joe Rogan is a professional bro.
Is anyone going to mention the wig?
Elon building cars for the new south African market I see.
You two together are great. We gain knowledge in a most entertaining way. Elon, your laugh is infectious. 3:37
3:03 that guy chewing gum so loudly should have been the one to be tested if an arrow would go trough...
There is something different about Joe in this interview, I can't quite put my finger on it.
This is a very Joe Rogan Video
Pretty sure that's He-Man
It would have been a great and safe car to drive during the wild west -  perfect cowboy car
That’s a tough wank, to be fair
Speed is better than mass.  Squares and all that.
World peace, social deconstruction, political turmoil. What do these guys do... arrow -> cybertruck
Aim for the battery.  I'd like to a massive tesla fireball.
Great advertising gimmick
Joe Rogan is doing way more than just weed and cigars,God dam look at them drug addict eyes that he has....fucken crazy
Man Joe looks so short while standing next to other people. So weird thinking if I ever met him in real life I would have to be looking down at him, just being so used to viewing him sitting all the time.
I'll say it if yall are to shy , ' Joe is drop dead gorgeous' . Thats the precise reason right there in front of your eyes for straight dudes going suddenly gay 💋💋💋.
How is the Cyber Truck with Crash test?
LMAO any else notice elons funny weird laugh when they get back on the pod after shooting the truck
Now that's a title and image to get me to click immediately.
But did he pay him the dollar?
The 2 biggest jokes....that don't know they are jokes. Sad
Damn. Im pretty sure my entire house would fit into joes extra garage he just has laying around. What a life that must be.
loool love this
I would not have been standing that close
The most dude moment
Zero to sixty times and the other sparkling distractions, don’t alter the reality of how useless EV trucks are to actual users. Certainly Elon is a showman, master manipulator and con artist without equal, as fascinating to watch   as an EV burning uncontrollably.
Love the hairdo Joe.😂 0:52
This is such a Joe Rogan podcast 😂 Instant classic.
JR, was the draw weight on your compound 25 or 30 lbs 😊?
Im Puerto Rican, and I approve this costume
Best free commercial.
Who was the a-hole eating chewing gum while filming the arrow shot? Wank
The wild Joe Rogans goes hunting
Karen Rogan?
Safe to say Elon musk and Joe Rogan are besties 🤣
Dude chewing gum literally ruined a viral video
What you should take away from this is that you need a Cybertruck to rob a liquor store so the cops can't shoot you through the car door. Got it.
1:51 Neither of these two remember what a one dollar bill looks like
This is my favorite combination of personalities and characteristics! #OG's 4 Sho! .. Joe take that man hunting!?... Elon's a bit of a gangst'a 🤠
Is it just me or was there a little bit of a delay between the arrow hitting and the blemish on the door showing up?
hey it’s the guy who spent billions to ruin Twitter
"Hey qtie! Mwuahhahahaah" LMFAO  4:03
Damn too bad Rogan isn’t live anymore.
That is absolutely insane that he didn’t get penetration! Not the best broadheads though Joe!  Get with it bud.
God damn Elo-man is tall compared to Rogan
That arrow dented the fuck out of it. Elon even had a developer tell him these trucks are a bust and he said f u. Cyber truck for the loss lol
Elon stood there with a wisky and cigar laughing while Joe shoots at his car, this guy is something else lol
Would make a great police car
how would this go if the arrow ricochet and killed Elon Musk? lol
I wish joe gave him a signed dollar and Elon frames it in his office and has to tell the story when people ask
No more gum chewing camera guy.
Joe owes Elon a dollar
Who the hell was chewing gum with their mouth open? Disgusting.
A field point would have delivered better results than a broadhead.
joe rogan casually has a fucking 30k fridge in the garage
Safety crumple zone? Insurance cost?
Pretty cool
Elon up $1
Okay… I’m buying this truck.
Every gangster is gunna want one of these 💯😂
He-Man and weirdo smoking joints shooting at cars and eating pineapple pizza. The fact that these guys are millionaires. Is somehow making life more OK.
Ah my asperger brother, you should know your force spec, damn your so much better than this😊, thank god it went the right way, but hwy base spec yes please
I could listen to elon talk all day!
Still a piece of shit of a truck
No way a broadhead penetrates that. Need a bodkin or something.
The man knows... hes building the truck we are gonna need.
What a scene 🤯 Elon and Joe as if they chill everyday
Was Elon cool with the dent 😢?
Bro this truck is never coming out!!!
No 1 purchaser of Tesla trucks: drug dealers, thugs/gang bangers & the cartels 😅
I miss the hello freak bitches intro
Damn. For a moment, it felt like that was what his hair always looked like.
Hilarious
Cop's nightmare
I thought Joe was dressed up as Luke Skywalker based on the thumbnail 😂
Both very intelligent in their own way of course elon is more so but lol
I saw the title and thumbnail and 100% thought this was one of those AI parody accounts.
Slowely this ugly truck is winning me over. Just can't get over the windshield wiper.
Broadheads wouldn't be the best for penetration. You'd want a bodkin for that. Also I know a 80 pound draw weight bow is a major force multiplier compared to a composite bow, but a crossbow can be designed to be much more powerful than any bow. You can make crossbows that are the equivalent to 250 pound bow or higher - stuff that you'd never be able to draw on even a compound.
I am not an expert but maybe he should've been at a more distant place when he shot the arrow to get more energy. It seems to me a very close shot and maybe that could  not get max speed/force. Also, i love JR, imagine having a friend like him, he is literally chilling  with the most interesting people in the world and have access to privileged information, he has interesting hobbies and always try to improve himself as a human being. Cool guy.
Love it! I want a Cybertruck so bad!!
That camera man with chewing gum during the arrow shot is the worst sound. Impressive
I like how Joe’s Halloween costume is him dressing as a guy that looks like him in a disguise.
Dude's being dude's. Listening to Elon talk on these podcasts is awesome. He is full of knowledge.
I love Aunt Joe ❤
I wonder if Ellon building these type of things has this little itchy area in his head where it thinks about armageddon..?
It’s like they just discovered steel
He made the fucking Batmobile 😂
So glad I got to meet this person haha in real life bucket list checked
This is so fucking cool.
All the criminals will buy the truck
Any geoguesser noddies wanna find his studio based on a reverse version of those garage doors lol
"We dug our own grave with the cybertruck"😂 Just imagine being hit by that thing or the impact of being inside a hardened steel truck during a crash. A real struggle for a rescue crew as well I guess. Still I'd love one of these
Elon is a G
40 years ago they were referring to their Nerfs.
That truck is going to be the biggest police vehicle contract ever.
USA PENDING 1 MILLION TRUCK ORDER FOR POLICE HEARD IT HERE FIRST
I dont think the results would be different on any other car
0-60 in 3 seconds on a 7,000 lb truck.. Who the F needs that lmao ! 🤣   Sounds awesome but jesus electric vehicles are fast
xQc cosplay.
Science!
Has Joe joined the Panderverse!!?? 🤣
Here I am wondering why there was a cow filming in the garage, constantly chewing on their cud. Keep your mouth closed when chewing, that shit is disgusting.
My aluminum truck will dent just looking at it wrong haha
Joe, glad to see you decid3ed to grow your hair out 😉
is it just me but is Elon Musk a cool guy??
Ah the gum chewing ASMR
The cost of the car has doubled after such an incident
Death trap
This made my day. I love how relaxed they are together. You can always get honest answers without any interruption
So, We need a cyber van in the grey/black red stripe.   maybe add a mount to put your flamethrower on.
Can someone tell me wtf Joe is wearing 😭
You look like Jimmy saval with the wig and cegar
the fuck is this!! LOL
Lol you see that broadhead snap off and almost hit Elon. . .that thing is 4 razor blades welded together. . .
Silenced by Instagram will continue Mission33 love wins always
Musk is correct. In the 1920's you could hide from bullets behind a car door. That's why they came up with the .357 magnum.
The richest man in the world betting someone a dollar cracks me up 😂
thought this was a meme when it first started with Joe just blankly staring with a wig on 🤣
Shit. It's good to be rich for that kind of things.
What happens to the other car if the cybertruck hit it?
That's an easy insurance claim for Elon 😂
Why is Joe dressed as Jimmy Savile 🤔 😂
Joe's compound arrow will put out 104 ft lb but firearms plus at 1000 foot pounds😮
Ai generated looking ah thumbnail frfrr.
Mission33 Jesus hijo de Dios everything is love
Man this is a cool video, Elon is on his shit.
Elon is so chill yet extremely smart with such well though out responses. I could listen to these two all day.
Is there a truly bulletproof model? If not, there should be.
Rifle round go right thru
Joe with a blonde wig alone is the funniest shit ever the rest is just bonus at this point gotta love this show only thing missing was if they talked about bears
I love when these two get together
Elons laugh cracks me up! 😂
That arrow would have gone all the way through my Ram.
How is that a truck, can't see it carrying sheets of plywood of any size or any cargo that a f150 can. Can you put a camper on it or a tonneau  for storage. Hell the DeLorean was more of a "truck " than this pos cybertruck .
That makes me want to buy a cyber truck
I was expecting this to be a pingtrip video lol watched 2 minutes before I realized it wasn't a funny mashup
EPIC!!!!!
Debt is made up if we stopped filming movies for a year we could solve so much imagine if we did the same with and exchange weapons of war and blood with peace and hope.
Why an arrow again; and not a bullet?
Can see Elon being flamed when some fucko decides to go postal and cops can't take them out, because they're in his bulletproof CyberTruck.
You know…the army should really think about finishing that mini tank someday…..
This is crazy
Elon is thinking of the coming dystopian cyberpunk future
I still can’t believe I met Elon in eagle pass 🙏
His garage is bigger than my house 😮‍💨 let me eat cake
Elon told you so 😂. Did nothing to his truck.
Why does Joe have a wig on though lol
so enjoy seeing and listening to these guys banter and chat both coming from very different spectrums yet able to chat smoke a stogie allowing the viewers to gain some kind of context on some very interesting points. Can't wait to see the truck in person.
Cool, a private tank! Thank you Elon! As you know: Elon is all about love to humanity!
Dude chewing gum forgot he was filming
love these guys 🤩
Had he not removed the wig while shooting the arrow, this would have been the perfect video.
Some people are gonna buy it because Teslas are status symbol cars and insecure people need to flex to feel superior but that is the ugliest car ever invented.
Elon left everything and went to his car like he literally felt that 😂
Totally awesome - "wonder if it would stop and arrow" "Want to try it?"  "Right now?" "Sure why not?"   Love this
Nah I had to end it when he said hey cutie followed by that laugh💀👀
They're both the good kind of mental.
Joe talking arrows Musk I can shoot spaceships into space and safely land them
Elon is so buzzed lol.
Another example why JRE is the Greatest podcast to date
Damnit joe what’s up with the wig hahaha
Love that Elon leans right and votes Trump!!!
Cyber Truck going to be the choice when you gotta "spin the block"
*Explosive rounds equipped  😧
I wish this was like 5 hours
Just casually steps into Joe’s warehouse sized garage.
I hit a boar too high and my arrow looked similar
What the hell is joe Rogan wearing ? Lol 😂😂😂 Amen
Bro I have been waiting for days to hear Joe's take on the fury fight.... Joe acting like that fight didn't even happen.....
Beast mode. Haha the timing.
No need. That things a hideous joke.
Now we know to the answers to the questions that we didn't ask
I thought it was going to ricochet too! I would definitely love that car, friken dope. You guys are awesome, Happy Halloween! …btw, Joe are you dressed up as a woman or is it my first and original thought, He-Man? Bc you definitely pull it off lol.  Edit: nvm saw the thumbnail, not sure who that is.
Who is joe dressed as?
This guy is a vampire. And that blonde chick is butch.
The folk who get the 1st cybertrucks better be prepared for the endless barrage of missiles they'll get launched at them from passers-by testing the vehicle.
5:33 Don't you want your car to actually be like that? Because in case of an accident, you want the body of the car to be able to fold and dissipate the energy. If the body is too strong, that means the passengers are gonna receive that energy.
You have a dent Elon
That's some aggressive gum chewing, Camera Man.
This might be one of the greatest videos ever.
This is sick 😅😅
Why does Joe seem grumpy
Shit in San Francisco/ Oakland I could use the add’l safety for my wife
That actualy is impressive!!
The best part is same price of a truck that have nowhere near the toughness. That is insane
The arrow would have barely known the door was there for a normal vehicle.
That gum chewing was by far the only thing keeping this from a 10/10 moment. It was atrocious lol
It's always so cool to see some of the most inspiring and successful people, hang out and do normal people stuff lol
What broadhead was joe using
Joe trying too be the smarter person in the room 😂 relating too crossbows
Why would you shoot a perfectly good truck like a dying horse holy shit
You can see Elon doesnt have much people around himself like Joe. He enjoys Joe's company.
Joe was schooled lol
That thumbnail is the most intense face Joe Rogan has made with a silly wig on.
Joe you look like He-Man
Bro, for Christ’s sake.. focus!
By far the coolest interview, Elon and Rogan, shooting that sick truck. So much love for this
4:05
Damn Joe look pretty 😂, am having a bonner 😂
Joe Biden is ordering 600 of these things to 'leave behind' in the Middle East right now.
It's a good thing you have a successful podcast Joe, because you sucked as a comedian
Damn so Elon is just cruising around in the only cyber truck on the road😂
Joe rules..
Joe should wear a kids birthday hat and carry around a wrapped box. People will think he is a child celebrating his birthday. No one will suspect a thing.
This thing is never coming out, lol. Not for any less than 100k
03:36. luck for us none of you had it
I’m listening with a broad smile, classic Joe
That speaks volumes.  A thousand words!
Big up boris Johnson for filling in for joe tonight!!! 🎵🎵don’t you know pump it up Corbyn is a c*nt 🇬🇧 actually fk stormzy boris and corbyn ✊💦 ….. Nigel for pm 🇬🇧 he really has got the muggles in checkmate now … beautiful… Duno how i ended up here but here we are ! 😘ttfn
What is this Hanover event he mentioned? I work in Hanover NH and would love to check it out! Anybody have a link? Google didn't help me
What will happen when gang bangers get ahold of these ? 😂
.   meh  .
5.7x28 goes right thru that crap. 30.06 and 3030 will also go right thru.
@3:12 are you serious with the open mouth gum chewing?
Joe is going to need to get something done with the worsening lines on his face...
Elon is a cool dude!👍
"I'll bet you a dollar" says the billionaire 😂
Why is this important, because most of us good average people work with and listen to people we trust...Just like these two...
Joe with that wig looks a lot like Prince Adam from He man
Lol "now we know"
IS ELON DRESSED AS CROCODILE FROM ONE PIECE? (I might be trippin)
Elon got this wicked laugh
Elon is one cool cat.
Great man
Imagine if Elon put his mind and money to something useful.
Elon smoking a cigar with joe rogan on the podcast shooting an arrow at his cyber truck and wearing a team Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 jersey is absolutely epic! 😂❤
Why is Joe looking like a poundshop prince Adam.
Joe wearing the wig is priceless.
Obviously Joe is not as smart as he thinks. 😊
This wearing of a blonde wig must be a sign to someone! Hey, he’s on our team kind of sign
Why be fucking chewing anything while holding a camera
I wonder how many police departments will buy cyber trucks, it would be a real smart move on Teslas part to get into that market
“Hey cutie” 😂
Hey cutie was crazy
Team Rubio jajaja. 🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
Beast mode daddy musk
hey cutie 🤣
My man Joe is wearing the PUERTO RICO BASEBALL WORLD SERIES jersey❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤!!!!
I wish I was rich bro 💀😭😭😭
Joe, please hold up a sword and say, "I have the power!"
The Tommy gun which is just a M1928 Thompson is a 45 caliber, 45 ACP to be specific. Elon is correct 9mm does penetrate better than 45, but 45 carries a lot more energy and can cause significantly greater physical trauma, larger permanent wound cavity and such. A lot of 9mm’s better penetration comes from its higher velocity. 9mm is supersonic while 45 ACP is subsonic.
Richest man on earth, with the most average joe response... "I'll bet you can't.  Betcha a dollar."
Cigar looked like an Espinosa Mercielago.
These two are ridiculous together. I love it. Elon just thinking about good marketing with this bow Joe puts him into situations where it would cause his stock to plummet if he avoided the demonstration.
Yo who is chewing that gum? Ew
car is ugly af, who is driving that garbage lol 😂😂😂
Elons laugh hilarious good one
Joe needs to move in with his love bud Elon. Joe is the biggest Elon fan boi on the planet & laps up everything his icon does.
Police: we can now hide behind car doors? Police orders 100 000 cybertrucks each with one  Optimus Prime Law and a tommy gun. Crime drops 50%
Joe Rogan suddenly getting the urge to shoot an arrow into a Cybertruck while smoking a cigar is the most Joe Rogan thing ever
Good way to catch an arrow
Elon musk is literally the best hes down to f around
That design has never grown on me... looks terrible. It's also no use because it can't tow any useful loads for any useful distance. EVs are an enviromental disaster too...
Joe looking like prince Adam before he turns into He-Man with that wig.
Funny thing is they might be able to sell that is like famous TV memorabilia Joe Rogan shoots compound bow at cyber truck before release
Joe's Costume = The day He-Man comes out of the closet.
What bow is Joe using? wouldn't be a bowtech would it?
If i can't work on it in my driveway I don't give a shit about it. Or any vehicle I can't work on in my drive way.
This video might break the internet! I wonder how many across all platforms/ total views this video gets? 500 million? 750 million? Or over a billion?
Where the full ep?!?
They came back and Joe has his hair upside down lolllll
I'm convinced Elon knows the apocalypse is coming and is building things to survive it.  Wants to get to Mars, but has cars and trucks that will be the only thing surviving whatever comes for the off chance he gets stuck on Earth.
Can we talk about the intro how we are greeted with Mrs Rogan and elon was nodding as if approving Mrs Rogan😂
Does it being bulletproof make it safer in accident scenarios?
Joe looks like He-man but older
I'm pretty sure that the same thing would happen with any vehicle
why does Joe Rogan look like Hulk Hogan
Homie dressed like a slythern graduate
Who is vigorously and loudly chewing gum behind the camera? You gotta be kidding me! No one wants to hear that!
something about the richest man on earth betting $1 on something is so funny!  Legit the coolest dude to have as the richest man and a bright hope for the future of humanity.
Joe just purchased a beast mode pre-order lmao
I want this ugly ass truck so bad
Doesn't seem like a CyberTruck would be very safe in a crash? Since breaking and crumpling is designed into vehicles to absorb energy.  It's the same reason why you want a helmet that will break if you fall and smack your head on the ground, rather than one that won't flex at all, and will just direct all that energy into your head.
It makes me sick seeing people worshiping these rich con men who got Ritchie by ripping off the workers who make them their money
Hey Joe, not sure if you're aware, but Spotify has now done away with the transition to ads and just blatantly added them in at 10 mins as part of the episode, so it's undistinguishable as an ad. Remember when you used to talk about "how gross it is that people run ads in the middle of an episode, and it just ruins the listeners experience" ... funny how we've come full circle eh?
lol a .45 is NOT "basically" a 10mm 😂😂
Would like to hang out with Elon musk ,probably a cool guy to talk to except that he's a billionaire.
Luckily it didn't take his eye out...
finnish outokumpu steel,best in the world.
Can anybody explain joe's wig? Did he lose a bet or something?
It made a dent?
Joe Rogan looks like Barney rubbel from the flint stones 😂😂😂
Bro laughed like the evil genius he is 😂
Musk already making Not A Crossbow
Somebody's gonna figure out Rogan's location from this video
I want a cybertruck now
Omg is that an assault bow. You might call that cow Kamel toe harris and let her take that assault Bow. Those should be illegal. Especially if thats an automatic bow.
Matt Farrah is so pissed rn
That's absolutely amazing! I was with Joe on this one. I've stuck an arrow in a chevy suburban and it went halfway through the door. That cybertruck is pretty badass.
He wasn't worried about ricochet at all
Elon is a legend, I’m sure he would be awesome guy to hang out with.
What universe is this again?
I wish he would have left the wig on while shooting the bow at the truck
Love Elon Musk. Bought 850 shares of Telsa a couple weeks back. Stock is down but its okay.
This was the most American thing ever
It feels like Joe and Elon are turning into their flash gitz version.
Loving it, will buy more Tesla stock 😂😂😂😂
Can not wait to watch this!
Whoaaaaah daaaaammn that is probably the most gangstah thing a person can do man. Shooting an arrow to the car of the richest person on the planet and Elon just literally smoking a cigar while watching! Both are legends.
Elon is up in something... Drugs or that fucking brain chip... Doesn't even look like the same guy.... If this is a "therapist" work, I need this immediately
I had to stop watching that gum chewing sound is disgusting
I would have to agree Elon Musk seems more relaxed than in most vids. When labeled the richest person in the world just being treated like another guy must be rare. An observation... I can’t muster up much sympathy for someone this clever. In a Nation where people feel a need to carry guns a bulletproof pickup is a must have item.
Use a blunt tip Arrow
barely scratched it!?!? bruh it literally left a dent! hahaha
Joe looks like He-Man, would love to see him in a pink tunic that makes him Prince Adam.
crossbow bolts were heavier in actual wartime use. get a windlass crossbow
Did u really just shoot it with a broadhead?! Do it again with a practice tip. Broadheads are for soft targets u nudnik
This is soooo epic we are witnessing history guys lol
Love it. Release the ⚡beast!
how did he think an arrow was gonna through when a 9mm couldn't....
as if an arrow could go through a car
Can someone please tell me why Joe is wearing a blonde wig?
Elon laugh is so mesmerizing
Everyone who wants an electric car already bottom and 20 to 30% are not gonna buy another one
Bro nobody is more gangster than Elon 😂 man smoking a stogie, glass of whiskey in the middle of a podcast while JOE ROGAN snipes his cyber truck with an arrow. #elonforpresident
If we weren’t subsidizing his electric cars or, subsidizing, his solar panel factories, the company would be bankrupt
The question is, are you shooting +P rounds or target ammo out of the .45 and 9mm? There is a ton of difference in the 2 types.
Joe looks high as f**k
4:05 Elon’s laugh
Neither one of these guys knows anything about guns or bows!
This mfer chewing right next to the mic….
Elon is the man! sure shoot my brand new not yet released truck
A new meme in the making!
No way this guy is running all these companys.
Brooo, you dressed like the guy! Hahabab
Joe identifies as a chilled Karen with that wig
Why is he wearing a girly wig?
You can really tell Elon likes Joe. Joe is the only interviewer that’s not out to get a scoop or is trying to get him to say something he shouldn’t. It’s just two guys shooting the shit!!! Love it.
So what’s the range on it while you’re towing up a hill 2 miles?
Yes, it’s an RC car
Primary position is between heaviest and most dense area of car and lunch.
That truck looks stupid af
AoC going to be jealous of Elon calling Joe "cutie".
Funniest thing is he bet him a dollar
Thats impressive *flicks hair back🤣
props on finding a Paddy Pimblett wig though
What’s up with the wig?
Musk is definitely not making a private army of autonomous vehicles that will report home when he's ready to declare war.
It’s a rich man’s toy that has no practical use
Oh boy, Cartel's in Mexico would love these trucks 😅😅
I thought this was one of the AI-generated talks at the start since Rogan was wearing a wig. Thankfully I watched it through.  Musk seems too cool to let someone shoot an arrow on his car. But I feel like he is kinda annoyed of the result too..
Seeing this clip put a huge smile on my face which I really appreciate because most days ppl are super stressed out aging way too fast losing time and dealing with daily BS they just want to escape which we can't do with TV or movies today so thank you for doing what you do.
hahahah.....totally cool.........still laughing 10 minutes later
Eye protection Joe!
I was a piece of junk trucks😂
Cool
“Hey cutie” 😂😂 @4:02
Obviously a broadhead ain’t gonna do it, a bodkin might be able to, and a really really heavy late medieval style crossbow might be able to as well
Elon is definition of coolness
I can't with the wig 🤣
Has Joe got a new haircut?
Such and Ugly truck, but I guess it will be unique.
Maybe one of the coolest , impromptu, event i’ve ever seen
I wonder how much the door is to replace or fix .
elon turning into 80's Schwarzenegger right before our eyes
Open the video, see a blond dude checkin Elon out, double checked the video I clicked
If this ever goes to market, which I doubt it will, it will be a death trap. Ever heard of crumple zones Elon?
Rich people problems ahahaha
I had to check this was the proper JRE channel twice at first 😂😂😂
I officially want one.
Elon says try it bro. Fantastic
My heart was racing
I guess I can get to the supermarket in lesss than a minute- my husband will luv the fact I can go out spend megga bucks have sum fun  with friends and be home and he ain’t gonna have a clue -  GO ELON .
Billionaire makes 1 dollar bet . There's a lesson there folks.
3:52 elon going to check on his truck after Joe shot the arrow cracked me up so bad 😂😂
When did HeMan get a pod cast!
Cyber truck vs Kentucky Ballistics my money is on Kentucky!
What's with the wig?  🤣
Fantastic entertainment
WTF 😂😂..
The Cybertruck is going to be used by Law Enforcement, it's the perfect vehicle application. Tesla is going to be selling millions of these things. Love or hate the design,  you can't deny it's durability, it's going to be the toughest and strongest vehicle on the road.
Billionaires shouldn’t exist. 💯
i'm not going to lie riding with that would be sick lol
Yasss. Get her back on YouTube.
1.  that was very dangerous, for richoches. 2. wanna see it vs the window.
Good 'ol Joe Rohan...
Nahh just imagine Elon dressing up as Joe Rogan with a bald Cap and Joe dressed up at Elon 😂😂😂😂
Elon with that evil laugh: muahahahaha
That's pretty impressive - The arrow at 545 grain and 275 fps puts out 91.42 FPE and 0.66 momentum which is about the same as a 9mm bullet in momentum. Whilst the broadheads aren't designed for penetration of hard materials, it'll blow through an soft target like an elk. A bodkin tip would probably be better against hard surfaces like this, but would probably still not be enough. A Ravin R500 crossbow with a 400 grain arrow might be an interesting test as it's probably got about 30% more momentum and 140% more energy... Come on, make it hapen Joe.
Rogan looks like jimmy saville, that’s scary 😳😳😂😂
It might be arrow proof but will still lose the bumper, lights and other pieces while running,  standard for Tesla 👍
This is what most men you know would be doing if they were rich lol
Bet that arrow would go through  both doors on a f150
I never knew Joe was a blonde🤔🤣
Elon saying I’ll bet you a dollar 😂
you have some good casts.. this has to be one of fun ones..thank you..
lol joe is dressed up as grimes
I have shot an old truck late 70's maybe early 80's truck up before.  The one spot that will stop a bullet.  Bondo!  AKA body filler.  Cool accidental thing to learn.  lol
I am not by any means an advocate of electric vehicles, in fact I despise them but, practically bulletproof is awesome. Especially when compared to a Ford with it’s aluminum soda can body.
the person chewing behind the camera was driving me insane lol
Elon has balls, i love it. He couldve gotten hit....most billionaires are inherrantly pussies
Elon laughs how I imagine the devil would after he says hey Cutie 😮
They are the best dynamic duo. President and vice president lets GO
Heavy as fk would not make it anywhere off road
Someone knows his physics and it aint Joe!
Coolest pair to ever do a podcast.
I’d like to see a target arrow with a stand tungsten point shot at it because I’ve seen safety tests where a compound bow 60lbs has gone through a sheet of 3mm steel at 70m
It's MA'AM
ELON, fix Tesla.  Shares are down...
We live in a strange and wonderful world where a bald headed guy sports a women’s blonde wig having a conversation about trucks and shooting an arrow in it with a billionaire.
3:45 DANG I wasn’t expecting that
Arrowproof, the new bulletproof.
Imagine trying to get out of the car after a crash and all electronics are out and it is designed like a steel coffin. Genius. maybe instead of the fire extinguisher you put a flamethrower in instead.
That was fun, good sport for letting you do it "right now" ha ha
Imagine the richest guy in the world makes you a bet for one dollar.
Wig???
I thought the title was a figure of speech.  Nope!
Love the hair Joe 🤣
Joe needed to put the hair back on after the failure of penetrating the door, and “ask to speak to the manager” 😂😂
Was the camera guy noshing someone off holyshit a little awareness dude........
Joe is a great influence on Elon "drink this whiskey, smoke this weed, try this cigar, let me shoot your truck." What's next?? Haha.
Whoever was chewing gum while filming this ruined that clip
I love this .... :)
Elon when Joe said "Ford" 😂😂😂
Elon should've bet him a week's worth of programming on the podcast.
Did Joe lose a bet?😂
I thought I got clip baited lmao
Joe Rogan looks like an elderly version of Prince Adam of Eternia
Just the richest man on earth and a comedian-podcaster-martial artist wearing a blonde wig , smoking weed and cigars, drinking whiskey and talking cars.
Fucking Tight!
Somewhere Cam Hanes felt the ripple in the force and says: “Hold my beer p@ssy!”
1) I can't believe Ho Jogan is finally transitioning 2) She is fucking stunning.
Elon already knew that arrow was not going to go threw.he was just being cool with joe.
Joe can I shoot your 150k dollar truck, Elon, go ahead. You can right now. Crazy. Cool dudes
0:29 Joe Rogan doesn’t know that electric vehicles have MOTORS like your starter motor Joe.  Engines are Combustion.  Four stroke.  Two stroke.  Thanks Wyotech.  I learned something.
This is awesome on many levels 😆
Elon betting $1 is the best thing I've heard all day 😂😂😂😂😂
Elon's fake new maniacal laugh is unsettling
who’s the twat chewing gum through the whole clip for fuck sake
The best part about Elon Musk is that he immediately wants to test something if its viably possible to do at that moment. Shoot his cyber truck? Fuck it, let's find out if it penetrates!  Next, they'll be testing the best rocket propellent made with household cleaners in the parking lot lmfao
Joe looking like Keefer from Righteous Gemstones🤣🤣🤣🤣
Uh… does nobody else notice something different about Joe’s… hair? Lol what
Joe lookin kinda short man.    Dont fuck me up plz im sorry
wrong arrow tip joe
EV's are a joke!!!!
Why the wig
I would be scared the arrow comes back and kills me haha
Field point is better with metals
I bet every security meassure was taken for this demo 😂😂😂
Police departments will LOVE this truck.  Fast, bullet proof, lockable bed vault.  It will take Tesla several years before the waiting period is down to a month.
so no one is gonna say anything about the chewing camera man? That was the most intense cringe I felt this year at least...
Joe, stop flipping the hair man 😆😆 i get it though... It's been awhile  you've dealt with hair.. but stop
300fps ain't shit compared to a bullet.  Air rifles can do 1000fps lol
Elon such a troll 😂
That'll be $1 my friend 😂
Elon: 9mm, 12 gauge, no penetration! Joe Rogan: I bet my arrow will go through it! Them silly little gun things ain't shit on my bow and arrow!
Cyber truck will sell like hotcakes
Cops are thinking dear god pls dont get in the hands of armed robbers ... Be so easy robbing a bank armour car in a cybertruck
It’s still a ugly ass truck
Who really believes that's just tobacco leaves in that cigar Elon is smoking? 🤣
but is it bombproof?
Rogan needs to layoff the testosterone he is growing blond hair
Claim that Dollar Elon!!! A bet's a bet!
Why’s Joe dressed like an absolute c*** 🤣🤣
How can Joe claim to be a patriot and have Putin's mate Musk on? The man who prefers Russia to America.
How cool is Elon Musk? I mean he is an awesome guy
That could have went wrong 🤣
MAN. Whoever was filming the arrow shot loved that gum they were chewing. Was it Jamie? I want whatever gum the camera guy had bad. If he’s got a flavor of gum that makes his chewing sound like a human body getting sucked into the engine of a 747, I want 40 packs
Elon casually in the background "we'll buff it out"...:D Those trucks are built that way to survive the rough landscape of Mars and it's storms.
I'm just in this video cause I'm wondering why he wearing my country's baseball jersey and a blond wig lol
Joe with a Puerto Rico jersey is 🔥 and funny
Joe looks like my nightmare version of a grandma. Orrr, that moment when ET wears a wig.  *shudders*
Between the focus and gum that video was unwatchable.  gross
Joe Halloweening as jimmy saville
This man is such a hero to every entrepreneur
WTF !!!! ELON IS THE GREATEST MAN ALIVE!!! SURE LETS DO IT!!!
Is your truck bulletproof?
I love how chill these 2 guys, A lovable podcaster and the most adoring Richest man in the world.
Perfect for robbing a bank?
that was fking great. if JRE ever extended to doing fun shit with cars, bows, guns etc that would be fkin cool
Police will need to start equiping their cars with EMPs in order to stop the Cybertruck
I feel a field tip would have done better and maybe gotten through.  So much energy is being lost and being redistributed in different direction as that broadhead makes impact and crumples.  It is likely a 125 -140 grain broadhead with thin blades, openings, and a thin long center point.  NOW if Joe had used a field tip.  That 125 - 140 grain would be condensed into one solid point with NO place to crumple.  So ALL the energy of the arrow will remain behind the field tip pushing it through and NOT be lost while crumpling.  Just one man's opinion. Rock on  🤘😎
That’s a jre, we need whistlin diesel test this once and for all i bet elon is gonna cry if he reads this comment 😂
Love Joe discussing the physical limitations of the cross bow and Elon making the math math in his head “Oh ya it can ! “
Life must be so much fun, with money dropping from ya ass.
Elon should be in Joe Rogan podcast more often. 😂
I wanna hang out with them they so chill 😂 and random af ❤ 💀
i love elon
No one wants to hear you chewing food on a podcast
lmao just two grown men in costumes talking about toys
Is Joe auditioning in that wig for the role of "He-Man" or what?
🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
So weird joe dressing like a trans on Halloween lmao 😂😂😂 then mfs thing they on our side elon and joe are part of the little group
"Shall we send someone to go and get it"? Thats priveledge.
Lol if I was Joe I wouldn't be getting too chummy with the worlds best snake oil salesmen...😂
Something changed with Rogans appearance.
Dang, this is probably the coolest thing on the internet rn?
Joe needs to stop hangin around on east 6th
"Hey cutie" 😆
He should had kept his wig on while he did it haha
I'd like to see footage of how it does in collision tests with other motor vehicles.
Love these guys!
Gold ✨
Is that a real wig or did the editor use a Karen wig filter?
Who is Joe supossed to be? 😂
This is exactly the type of things I would do if I was in the position to do super rich guy shit
It's amazing that we get to live at the same time as Elon
This is how super villians/heroes are made. This is the greatest bromance
Joe is rocking the Jimmy Saville look for Halloween.
Puerto Rico 🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
Didn't know laird hamilton would be posting for Joe this week.
Ya hear that A-Team?
TSLA is taking a shit better march Elon out on JRE
I know this is clearly not true, but elon seems so dumb.
But it's so ugly!
Elon musk is the only one getting things ready for a cyber or zombie apocalypse. Musk  is a G
Wow! He just dented an unreleased car haha
Probably the best endorsement ever.
Imagine if SWAT used the CyberTruck. That would be badass.
Why does Joes wear a wig?
I almost prefer the Caitlyn Rogan Experience.
that gum chewing is horrendous
Well now we know.
What about a 4 bore?
Hummer replaced
Ooh so this would be perfect for the bad guys to have? Unless the government makes them put engine kill which they already do I am sure
Now do the window.
The most amazing truck to never sell one model
Let's try a stinger missile on the truck!😂
Joe rogan shooting arrow at a cybertruck while Elon Musk smoking a cigar!!! This part of the podcast will remain as one of the best podcast moments in the history!!
K that was awesome 😂  Good times for sure  Happy Halloween all stay Safe!
Im more interested in joes building, thats one serious podcast
Damn
this truck will kill so many people if it gets into an accident. A truck this solid and hard; it will turn any regular vehicle to paste upon impact so best hope you never hit someone w this thing
Rich Guy Games lol
Cigars Saves Lives"..
My favourite part was listening to someone chewing gum with their mouth open like a toddler.
Is Joe Cosplaying as Logan Paul or what?
Joe has a certain He-Man look to him. All he needs is an orange fuzzy loincloth.
Field tip would probably work better than a broadhead
Get Elon a drink, his dry mouth is coming through loud and clear
Hearing the person holding the camera during the demonstration chewing their gum was infuriating.
joe gives 1 dollar to Elon and repeats dare with original bet
That was a crazy thing to do, that was INSANE to do without eye protection!!!!!
Elon is the worst person for a podcast. I can hardly even make it through the clips.
This is what internet was made for 😂😂😂
Ric Rogan lives
Nice wig you look like my ex mother in law
They damaged that truck just for a video...smh...
The thumbnail had me wondering and watching this video just made things worse!
Omg the guy chewing gum behind the camera 🤢
We getting stoned
These two need to do more together. Its always amazing.
Joe with that wig on looks like the original HE-MAN action figure…  🤔
They are great , they work hard , they are very good at what they do, they fight back when necessary, and they really know how to seize the moment ....." Ok let's try , let's do it right now, let's go get your bow and arrow at your home, let's film it live with no preparation , i'll take the risk "  What's not to like ?    i wish i had been there, to document this , really !
Joe just ruined that arrow, how will he financially recover?
i want that dollar with both of their autographs on it.
Joe Rogan is a freak of nature
elon is a con man. why would electric cars beat anything? it can’t. hybrid sure. solar needing a plug to fossil fuels. No. liar!!
I love this!! ❤ Its been since I was a child I've dreamed of getting a vehicle this much!
Joe looking more feminine than 95% of the alphabet community 💀
0-60 time and arrow impressive
Joe is looking old and look how tall he is to the door where he’s standing, those lifts still make him look short
who the fuck is chewing gum behind the camera, come on man
Thought I was tripping when I saw the thumbnail, Wtf is going on with Joe 😅
Joe looks like a karen he-man
I honestly had no idea if this was an AI skit or real life. True 50/50
Elon was sipping harder than ever 😂
Elon is wrong about the crossbow/arrow comp, but he was right about it not penetrating
Thought this was an AI mock-up from the thumbnail
Elon back at it again protecting us from our government
I like archery, but with all the tech to advance it,really losses it’s value of it’s origin. Just stick to what it use to be instead of what you want it to be more of.
Hey, you dent it, you'll buy it!
in case you come across robinhood on your way to your daily 9-5
I love how when Elon said 'I'll bet you a dollar' , Joe knew he was serious.
The fact that Joe has been friends with Elon for a couple of years is insane, great episode 😂😂
Use a tenpoint crossbow next time
Elon is every kid or me as an adult, wanna get it done straightaway.  Joe: we should shoot an arrow into the cyberstruck but I don’t have it with me  Elon: Can someone go get it… 😂   love it!
Elon really is one of the greatest people of today
Huge thank you to whatever sow did the cell phone footage and never presumed how to chew with their mouth closed
That seemed safe lmao
Who's chewing like crazy?
Perfect for the zombie apocalypse
Elon and Joe Rogan are my two favorite people
Whoever was recording the shenanigans in the garage needs to never chew gum near a camera again..
This is so random lol
give me a rock and i'll show you how strong the vehicle is..
Joe seems a little tipsy lol
Well that could of ended badly 😂
I didn't expect the arrow to cause sparks. Pretty cool.
Elon musk getting us ready for some type of alien invasion. Wtf
Can we send someone to get it. Lol
❤❤❤
Should make it pepper spray ppl trying to break into it lol
Imagine getting a cyber truck personally delivered by elon musk
ok what magic is this? the dent appears in the car before Joe shoots the arrow... just do . and , go frame by frame and have a look  https://youtu.be/5m5ybZD_z6A?si=hmsmGY6r8BxzSIgL&t=216
Jamie was right in the full episode when Elon  said he wasnt sure if there was a manufacturing movie. Early 80s Michael Keaton was in Gung Ho about car maker in japan and the workers trying to meet the sales goals to keep plant open.
Use a tenpoint crossbow
This is the culmination of Joe's podcast and bow hunting training for the past 20 years
Must be some good gum.
it seems a pig was recording, that's new.
The chewing sound in the audio was so annoying.
Hey Joe. Francis Ford Coppola made a movie about auto manufacturer called Tucker: The Man And His Dreams
I repeat if aliens ever come please have Joe Rogan represent US lol this is def a great video
The Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 shirt!!! 🔥🔥
Every police dept in America is thinking “oh shit, can we get one” ?
That was one hell of an interesting video. Good to know that. Thank you guys
Are cop car doors not reinforced?
Elon musk a stoners best friend
How is this not on trending but some shitty "rapper of the week" with 20k views is up there?
Think Elon is gonna keep the dent in it, as a souvenir?
The f is Joe wearing😂
It’s really interesting to see Joes experience shooting line up with Elon’s knowledge of physics line up.
As long as one of them runs for president Idgaf
The best thing I’ve seen in a month epic.
The A-Team was a lie? Sad dayz ...
Gonna cost like $50k to fix that dent!
I mean good for him. He’s backing up what he’s claiming.
Y'all are some cool ass dude's!
Puerto Rican Joe is legit.
I'm not even gonna ask anything about the wig
whats with the wig?
A-Team is dating him....bro you're what close to in your 50s if you aren't already....you aint looking 20 no more buttercup
My two favorite people, shooting arrow and eating pizza.
Impressive
Joe snap with that custom fr 🇵🇷🔥😂 , much love for Joe 💯💪🏽
Why is he wearing a wig
Why is joe looking like He-man 😂
Hey Cutie, Hahah
Should be standard police edition vehicle. Dude land that contract get production flying and use the tax payers money to make this cheap enough for the regular joe to afford. I’d drive one.
Think this is the closest we get to Tony Stark in real life.
THAT WAS AWESOME😮🎉🎉🎉
Joe: “Let’s see if I can shoot an arrow through your car.”  All CEOs not named Elon: “Ummm…I’d love to but I’ll need approval from my legal, technical and Board first…”
The future is now
These dudes looking like some batman villains chillin on their day off... Man sign me in!!!
What's with the wig?
The A-team had an armored van, duh
It's too bad that there won't be a zombie apocalypse because zombies can't shoot weapons.
Wtf is he not supposed to be a genius but yet dont know how to hold a cigar properly 😅😅😅😅
Wowe
"Hey cutie" 😂
Bro said $1 you can shoot through my truck with an arrow
That was choice!  "If I lose.... I can drive home with an arrow sticking out of my car".  The more I listen to Elon the more I respect him.
Joe Rogans audition for Masters of the universe live adaptation
Musk knows everything about everything!
Joe could be a Rogaine spokesman!
A Course only in America that you need a bullet-proof car😢
Y’all ready for the Tesla crossbow?
I love these two so much!
Thank you so much for your rational thinking and you are men. We need you! I will also do my Part..
Ugliest truck I’ve ever seen. Of course it’s not going to go through it, it’s not an elk dude. It’s not impressive at all
Two rich dudes.....betting a dollar. Too cool.
Yes, we are definitely living in the 21st century.
who holding the camera eating ice
hiding behind a car door is to reduce the aiming ability for a tango and give the officier stabilization for aiming.. Now the cybertruck door is bulletproof that makes him 100% able to replace current police and first responder cars ..
Wait they acutually did it
Men that live as Demi Gods!
7000 lbs is not alot , heavy duty truck weight is over 8600
Whoever is standing next to the mic with a mouth full of pop rocks ... politely fuck off 😂
Paddy Pimblett looking ass
Video is currently unavailable on Spotify. Team YouTube is eating their lunch
Joe is remarkably comfortable when dealing with douche bag   draft dodgers
One of the few situations in history where it makes sense to maniacally laugh as somebody prepares to shoot your vehicle.
Joe an elon what a combo!!
" Hey Cutie"
So did they reclone a skinny Elon....
Whats up with the wig 😂
All of this shit we hear about the Cyber truck but nobody has ever answered this question.   What is the towing range with a 6k LB boat?
This is a real wholesome interview,  Elons in jamies, rogans playing dress up. Both of them casually smokn a cigar shootn arrows 🏹 n sh!t. I just learned the tesla cybertruck isnt as whimsical as it seems, powerful stuff!
is Joe trying to be Jimmy Houston?????
Joe pulled a "Hold on, I just realized I don't care about anything you're saying" on Elon about his stupid bow
Cameraman never loses, slow it down right after the arrow connects and you’ll see a piece of that arrow zip right by
How about, it's not bullet proof, but the panel gaps are straight and lines up correctly
imagine there was no religion and wars,, and every country had there own Elon and Joe Rogan unlimited money and a huge book of inventions too create ,,
That guy chewing while he knows he is using the camera microphone! I could barely hear the dialogue.
Taking notes for the apocalypse
I think he would’ve had better look with a heavier field tip.
That’s the most Joe Rogan thing ever!
Joe dressed like he-man
Joe was dangerous.  The arrow could have ricochet and hit Elon or someone else.  Stop doing stupid stuff putting Elon in harms way.
Elon can’t be too happy about the dent/scratch on his cool car?!  🤭🤣
Jamie has a degree in physics.      And Elon.
Joe 'totally Elon's shill ' Rogan.
*BEAST* mode version !!!
I would NOT and DO NOT trust Elon Musk one iota - I don't care how much he is worth, how many contraptions he makes (all not for the good of man) or what he says about how "good" all this is for us but this man is one of the most deceptive humans on the planet - just so you all know he is so close to Klaus and the gang at the WEF and just brought on as his "assistant" a woman at the top of the food chain of the WEF.
Can't help but thinking... "it is ma'am,  it is ma'am! "
Joe got a haircut just to shoot the bow.
I hope Elon is ok man, he doesn't seem himself
Joe knows Speed. Elon knows Force.
Joe talking to a billionaire wearing a silly wig 😂 amazing.
Musk definitely has that gangster laugh. 😂
What are you trying to prove having a bulletproof car for every day driving? Nothing
I’m so used to Joe with a bald head the wig is really throwing me off
Joe's he-man wig is killing me
he-man(?) luv it, lol
The weight is a tax thing. They're mentioning it as a sales pitch to those who know.
Probably "the" best FREE advertising yet for the Cybertruck that I have seen.  I know Elon agreed to start spending "some" money on advertising, but this demonstration was FREE and very impressive.  The Tommy Gun thing he's going to show next month will be awesome as well.  We've already seen the result it pictures taken as the Cybertruck was rolling down the highway filled with "bullet dents" instead of bullet holes!
Fu** I want one of them trucks, also, you wanna see what guns will do to a vehicle look at Bonnie&Clyde's truck when the cops finally caught up with them and got tired of their crap. Looks like swiss cheese.
Joe looks hilarious with that wig, especially when he talks seriously. 😂 Love it!
Look at Joe's first podcast with Elon to this one. Elon has aged horribly
Joe owes him $1. A bet is a bet!
The cyber truck looks like a half finished b is for build car.
5:07 "Trucks are supposed to be tough, ...is your truck bulletproof?"
Pince Adam 😂😂😂
Crims all around be swapping from hellcats to cyber trucks I swear.
2:34 A 45 is definitely not like a 10mm. 45 is way slower and has about half the kinetic energy
Elon for even cooler didn’t think he could
Notice they didn’t shoot the window?
Lmao if a bullet won’t go through the car then of course an arrow isn’t going to it doesn’t have nearly the velocity
Lizard noises
Elon tryna get in on that military industrial complex money by selling these to the Army, Mercenary groups, and Police stations
Joe dressed in Team Rubio attire is priceless 😂😂😂
young jamie mackin his gum right in yo ear  also can't figure out how to focus a camera
My favorite demons..
From experience I can say speed beats armor.
I just watched an episode of Chips where this guy who was part Native American and he shot an arrow in a 1970’s model car door.
Elon will be our saviour in times of need. True to our modern needs as a species without the psychotic greed.
Joe's costume 😂
US police dept will deploy these in your local neighbourhood
I love Elon I can tell Joe does too he's always on his show I like Joe also I would love to sit down with these guys and have a conversation with them two great minds
Elon drinks more than you think he does he can hold his liquor. But so do I not judging just stating the facts
Elon is making this truck for the people to defend against the globalist takeover, it’s a civilian defense tank, cyberpunk truck
Elon is a g
Joe just steals the scene 😂 I can't stop staring
Peak humanity right here
I’m way to high for this 🤣🤣🤣
Body damage on one of those can’t be cheap to repair.
Love this conversation.
It’s so strange seeing Joes whole body and not just his upper half😂
This keeps getting better and better
Hai hai hai hai hai haii
I want that truck now
Bro I love how he’s paying homage to that meme 😂😂😂😂😂 💀
WTH just happend ahahahhah
what's up with the blonde wig Joe? I might start doing that
Could of taken someone's eye out
When TSLA stock drops Elon returns to making Content. Otherwise no interview ever
Joe and Elon bet like the old dudes in "Trading Places".  The only thing missing are the fabulous cans of Jamie Lee Curtis.
Why he call him cutie ?
These two people are awesome. Then the arrow shot, made this the best podcasts video ever made!!! Definitely would go hunting with Joe and Elon, in Ketchikan Alaska tho.. . These guys just made this podcast fantastically awesome!💯💯💯
Elon betting a dollar shows hes a down to earth dude.
Joe should've kept the wig on that would be a legendary moment
His head is unusually large    I think he suffers from  that issue   something  cephaly
I’m more interested in the tyres. What’s there story?
He built it because, if anyone needs one, it’s him. Unfortunately.  Not many people will bet you to shoot at their own truck. Must be a Rich Texas thing. Boy Howdy.   Happy Halloween! ❤👻🎃  🔥🔥🔥
lol a billionaire betting a dollar? hilarious
Elon said there would be autonomous cars next year, every year, since 2014
haha I've seen this clip in my recommended feed in YouTube and immediately went to Spotify to start listening haha
Wait, is this a joke? 2 morons with the combined iq of the average temperature in celsius have so many fans? we are fkin doomed
Hey cutie haha I love elons sense of humor
Hey quetie! 😂
We want more clip
So stupid
Well that’s the best car commercial I’ve ever seen
"Is your truck bulletproof" has the same energy as: "what color is your bugatti" lmao
That will buff out.
It’s perfect if you don’t need to go more than 200 miles…. 🙄❌ Electric vehicles are the worst
If only the camera man wasn’t obnoxiously chewing louder. It would have really improved the video.
just to dudes doing guy stuff
Ohhhhh Jeo 😂😂😂😂I  never ever thought you would wear a woman's wig 🙄🙄🙄Hanging out with Elon Mask,,BAD IDEA "He is sheep 🐑 in wolf 🐺 clothing...Elite power with Elite power..I am out of here 🙄👋
You COULD in those 80s movies... Because cars weren't made of carbon and plastic then. Doors were steel & aluminum. As usual... He didn't invent something new... He repackaged something people forgot about.
haha awesome.
Sickkkk❤
Wow very interesting ❤️🔥
I DONT WANNA OVERLY-GUSH ON THE MAN BUT 5:58 SECONDS- TIME-IS-MONEY 5:58 IS WORTH MORE THAN THE AVERAGE ANNUAL INCOME FOR AN AMERICAN JEFF BEZOS AT HIS PRIME EARNED IN 1 DAY, MORE THAN 365 DAYS OF AN american bank ceo (BUT, YOU CAN ALSO FLIP THAT BY SAYING DIFFICULTY LEVEL OF BEING A FOUNDER/INVENTOR/CEO OF A PLAEC LIKE STARLINK ETC. IS 365x HARDER THAN BEING BASICALLY A casino-ceo AND MR. MUSK ECLIPSES MR. BEZOS JUST TRY TO THINK ABOUT THAT; LIKE HE COULD HAVE SHOWN UP JAN 1 AND BEEN LIKE (OK FOLKS! SEE YOU NEXT YEAR!) AND THESE bank ceos DO THEIR casino ceo THING FOR THE NEXT 364 DAYS MR. MUSK WOULD HAVE OUT-EARNED THEM; DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? THIS MAN IS LEGITIMATELY- AND elizabeth warren: WIPE YOUR DIRTY BUTTHOLE BEFORE YOU TRY TO SHAME PRIVATE-COMPANY CEOs INTO COMMITTING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM ON THE BASIS OF: "other countries sht stinks" WHEN YOU HAVE THE DIRTIEST BUTTHOLE
Elon saying I’ll bet you a dollar to Joe😂 that’s really nice for one of the richest person in planet Earth to say 😂 really gotta love this man
Hey cutie 😂😂
That gum cheewing is next level
Now we know, and knowing is half the battle.
dont want to give it away? you don't want to release the damn thing - clearly!
Legendary lol😂😂😂😂😂
I'd like to thank Joe for letting us know what Iggy Pop would look like on TRT.
Man I've just smoked a Zoot watching Joe in a wig is killlling me man 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
A field point is what you would use , not a fkn broad head 🤣
Joe you are sob you have dented my dream truck 😂
King douche and the toe
What the F... ! Joe rogan in a wig and elo musk looking kite a character from Cluedo and I'm no where near a bag of mushrooms !
Joe ows Elon a dolar
This 2 people together are awesome and answer so many questions I want to know thank you Joe and Elon
Joe should have kept the wig on while he shot the arrow 😂
Tesla stock will probably skyrocket if this truck delivers well
Need to test it with a Bodkin tip
nice tupee
Best god damn truck advertising ive seen in awhile 😂
Sooo good 💪
Rogan dressed as the meme is so funny
Richest man in History….Bought Twitter because….bets $1 that Joe wont shoot an ancient technology arrow into his bulletproof tank. Lol.
I thought either Heman or Hollywood got to Joe
Joe looks like the He-man action figure from the 1980’s 😂
2nd best JRE guest right behind Alex Jones.
If someone buys ine of those its strictly for looks. That is not a functional work truck. Teucks are tools not hotrods
Love the Puerto Rico Jersey
Why does joe look like my auntie Lynn with that wig on 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 but being mates with Elon would be mad though
Anybody seen tango and cash? This car reminds me so much of the car they use at the end of that film
Lol 😂😂 that was great, and more shocking to me, is why is Joe dressed as Marilyn Monroe that was dating Lindor.
Joes a vice joes a must
What elon said about bullets going through doors is very true. I had someone shoot up a car i had and the rounds went through the trunk, the back seat,the front seat and lodged in the gauge cluster.
It was awesome watching Joe and Elon shoot arrows at cybertrucks and eat pineapple and anchovy pizza.
When Elon isn't building rockets, he's just God! You guys got a bit of a bromance there? Elon is looking dandy, and Joe is looking fairy?? Joe, did you dress up Britney, especially?? 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
The "hey cutie" is so out of pocket wtf that guy could buy all of California if he wanted to
half the fun of joe rogans podcasts was reading the comments, cant do that on spots
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE when Elon is on any podcast, especially JRE! Two of some of the BEST men on this planet!
How cool would it be to have Elon as friend? Ask Joe, for a moment they were just two buddies having fun, shooting arrows on a truck kind of fun.
That arrow can ricochet and kill someone.
Most JR moment 😂
Haha I never know if this AI convo or real.... 😂
2 years and we will see entire police departments driving around in cyber trucks 😂
Joe looks better like that
I thought the Cyber truck looked ridiculous when announced but if Elon is making it genuinely bullet proof and sub 3 second 0-60 I can see it selling in large numbers!
What's with the head wig? Everything OK Up There?
Watching the views build up irl is wild
A 90 pound bow with a 520 grain arrow should be hitting faster than 300 ft per sec. I don't believe he's shooting 90# either.
300fps is SLOW compared to a rifle round.
That “Hey Cutie” at the end had me ☠️ 😂
The bullet proof qualities of the truck would make it super popular in Chiraq
Elon is a such a g. Mega Chad bro
Do it with iron wills!!
Joe should have signed the dent. And the guy chewing gum should be fired
THE CHEWING SOUNDS. WHY GOD WHY
Badass Joe! Ill watch every time you have EM on! #cybertruck for the win!
I never knew Joe was a transvestite.
Joe Rogan look likes he man with that blonde wig with a Puerto Rico baseball jersey LMFAOOOO Joe Rogan is my guy lol
What’s with the blind wig 😂😂😂😂
Ended with a proper Burp 😂
Why is Joe dressed as Elon's new baby momma?
Why does joe look like paddy pimblett??
This is awesome..
real neat too bad that thing  would break down in two heart beats if you take it off roading like a real truck.
So what happens when this thing re ends a Honda civic? Just death?
That’s awesome
That shattered arrow could have gone into your eye or groin.
I can see how the idea of a bulletproof truck came to Elon’s head at the time when he was building the Tesla factory in Texas 😁
MR. MUSK NO SUBTEXT NO EXAGGERATION IS MY ROLE MODEL IN LIFE THERE ARE ONLY ~40 PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE SUCCESSFUL (OR, AT MINIMUM: 'FINANCIALLY SUCCESSFUL') THAN ME IN LIFE AND HE IS THE #1 (ABOVE ME OBVIOUSLY) THE THING THAT IS SO- LIKE- THE REASON I TRULY ADMIRE AND APPRECIATE HIM IS BECAUSE IN A WORLD WHERE (AND BTW THIS IS FAR MORE COMMON AMONG THE millionaire-class BUT THERE ARE SPRINKLES OF THEM WITHIN OUR BILLIONAIRE-CLASS) IN A WORLD OF nepotism/american-oligarchs/legacy/scumbag politicians (THIS IS INTERCONNECTED WITH american-oligarchs) ETC. THIS MAN - WHO MIND YOU WAS BORN INTO A MIDDLE-CLASS BACKGROUND WITHOUT ANY: "my dad is soandso but at least I did like 2% to make it where I am!" OR "well I have egghead chuckschumer american-politician on speed-dial you better do as I say or else and give me those business contracts or else" IS 100% SELF-MADE (LIKE ME, MIND YOU) 100% SELF-MADE ABSOLUTE 100% NO BE ESS SOMEONE YOU WANT TO EMULATE IN LIFE OH YEAH, AND THIS IS NOT SOME 78 YEAR OLD bitter small little napoleon complex midget mikebloomberg TYPE OR A larry fink TYPE: HIS CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY IS DIRECTLY OBSERVABLE AND MEASURABLE; NOT SOME larry fink TYPE STUFF! (BTW, FROM THE EYES OF ECONOMICS larry fink IS SO OLD HE'S NOT TABULATED WHEN IT COMES TO 'EMPLOYMENT': IT'S 16-64 BUT THERE'S A REASON FOR THIS: THIS larry IS LIKE 75+ YEARS OLD
what's with the karen haircut 🧐
Wow. The sparks when the broad head detonated... I don't think a lot of governments will allow sale of this thing. I know in Canada it's illegal to own body armor without a firearms license for no good reason.
i wouldn't get the dent repaired thats a memory and a story !
Super impressive!
God that gun chewing
Elon is just something else. Like the nerfed version of Nicola Tesla of the 20th century. Because Nicola Tesla and his free energy is ultimate. I doubt if Elon finds it, would be around much longer though.
So, a bullet proof car can stop an arrow?  Who woulda thought!?
Panderverse
Joe's looking old. When's he gonna admit all those supplements and growth hormones don't do shit?
Joe; It's moving really fast Elon: Yea it's velocity times unit of energy area. Joe: It's moving really fast
That was sick, lol.
Luv Luv Joe Rogan  Luv Luv Elon Musk  PS:  Joe Rogan - blonde ain't your color
Legends 🤣🤣🤣
I love the measuring of dicks here ...1st corner you have Rogans crossbow and in the 2nd corner you have Elon Cyber truck .. 🤣
Haha...ok..but why?
Elon just advertised to millions of people and won a dollar. Genius
Joe looked like a 3yr old. He looked so happy and excited when Elon said let’s do it now.😅
STOP SMOKING!!!
With a nice passe partout sticker and the right acid you can do fun things. Or just the acid spray. Aciding the new keying?
First!
hear me out... a he-man live action movie starring joe rogan
Why would you want a truck to go 0 to 100 under 3 seconds…..unless you’re trying to run away from an RPG.
I wonder how much that dent cost to fix on that truck. Well worth it though for the exposure or advertising
Just superb. love the interaction and Elon's confidence.
Imagine thousands of years ago when humans had bigger brains, i bet the average person was as smart as Elon, and the genius created even greater things
As a man who uses trucks on a daily basis, 0 to 60 means NOTHING to me.
Who the hell is chewing gum like their life depends on it?
What are the other two demonstrations besides the Tommy gun before they got off on the arrow tangent?
Elon.! Put the whiskey down that blonde is never gonna look good..!!
“…and we can do this TODAY! …and it will be delivered BY THE END OF THE YEAR…” Elon, 201… always. Still waiting.
the boys will be boys feel from this is hilarious
Can’t wait for flash gitz
The Prince Adam Experience
Commercials?  We don't need no stinking commercials.
Damn I gotta make more money and hang out with these people 😂
FREE PALESTINE
Who tf is chew like a cow when filming?? So annoying.
Is Joe He-man?
At 3:03 i saw it ..and i was like ....no way 😮they gonna do it for real...? 😮😮😮😮
Can you crash test head on with a semi both at full speed?
This is stupid so I'm giving it a Like!
I like how Elon only bets 1 dollar.
Wtf who chewing gum like a east LA hooker in the video
Why the fuck is Joe wearing that wig?
I don't think they noticed it sparked lol
Epic, you could tell neither of them could think of anything else once the idea of shooting the truck with an arrow was brought up. "when do you want to do it" "towards the end, we could do it right now" 😂😂
Elon musk laugh and Joe Rogan animal noises two duos of the century
Elon: what if it ricochets  Joe: does it anyways lol
A buddy of mine had a '68 Buick Riviera which in case you don't know was from an era when they still built stuff out of much heavier steel. Anyway, it was parked on the street in Ft. Collins, co in about 1985 when some car full of knuckleheads decided it was fun to drive down the street and shoot up all the parked cars as they passed. Elon's absolutely right. the bullets went clear through and not just through the doors. Because of the angle of the shots, some went in the driver door and out through the passenger kick panel (where your feet would be if riding) and  inner fender, and one through the driver door and out the passenger floor pan. one of the penetrations in the driver door also blew through the arm rest blowing out the stuffing and making a nasty exit hole.
NEVER SHEW GUM WHILE FILMING!!!!! Jeeze.
“ Bro, thinks bow and arrow will go through, where 9mm doesn’t ? Some of these bows are killer. Seen a video where it went straight through wild boar without any problems.
New episode! I could listen to Elon all day
I freaking thought this video was AI from the title and thumbnail 💀💀
What was the control? Did Joe shoot the arrow on another car, so that we could compare and try to understand the differences?
5:51 nice burp, elon
Puerto Rico en la casa 🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
Elon hire me lol. I bulid you're A/C ducks for the union under DSI at the giga. Im bored 😴 i need that exciting stuff ill work for cheap! 🫠
love the cigar smoking.
Elon just said  "You can try it right now" 🤣🤣🤣
Rich people shit : “I bet you can’t pierce my armoured electric truck with your bow and arrow”  😂
Stop soking joe's bamboo yall
Nice.
Wanted to see him shoot the window
Joe Rogan has hands down the coolest life sometimes. Shooting arrows on Elon's cybertruck and making bets, somking cigars, drinking whiskey and talking about the future and technology.
Broad head are for game...try using a bodkin...thats armor piercing amo for bows...
Cameraman close your mouth. Thanks alot
♥️ ♥️ ♥️
Other brands have had 3 second electric trucks...for years now.
Bro that's gonna be the ultimate defense in the hood 💀
Damn, that is so fricken cool. And Elon acting like it ain't no thing for a 100k truck to get scratched.
😂😂
Cybertrucks, the gang members choice of transportation.
Where does Tesla get its Cobalt?
Every "CODE 60" SKINNY will WANT THIS PROOF VEHICLE,  not going to outrun anything for LONG DISTANCES>>>>
Elon needs to married ivanka trump They will make such a nice couple and create smart  children together and pretty too
I am not ready for the Police fleets of Cyber trucks out there.
Is Joe dressed as a Karen?
I love watching big ass kids have fun 😂
I thought this was Pingtr1p lol
Joe getting older is sad for me.
If it would stop a bullet then there's no way an arrow would penetrate.
How can you not love Joe and Elon.
So 5:40 he wants police to order them?
🔥🔥🔥🔥
bullets wont penetrate the truck but he thinks an arrow will..
Fucking camera guy chewing MAD gum
Imagine thugs and criminals driving around in Tesla trucks instead of Hellcats and whatever else the drive. They’re going to be playing high stakes lazer tag in the streets of Chicago inside an armored Tesla truck lol.
Is Joe dressed for Halloween as Jimi Saville?
Who tho fuck is smacking their gum?
This might be the only truck that has been tested against Native American warfare tech
Dang Joe grew his hair already..
Wtf 😂😂😂😂 is Joe “ they  “ now ?
Elon ready for the boogaloo😂😂😂
This was an awesome occasional demonstration! Great camaraderie between you two. Great show guys!!
Joe looks like jimmy Savile
too many ads on the podcast it's crazy
A f*cking wig? where is the respect.. grown up americans lmao
Elon‘s laugh at 4:05 is about as supervillainlike as it gets
The car door is to hide not shield. Granted Hollywood makes it a shield, but it's still more practical than being in the shooter's line of sight.
What look is joe going for lol.  paddy pimblett😅
poor guy losing so much money with Tesla he had to call an emergency podcast
That bow is almost as tall as he is.
Elon is lowkey preparing 4 the zombie apocalypse
Hey cutie HAHAHAHAH Evil Elon laugh 🤣 Tremendous in Joey Diaz voice
More free advertising for Tesla
One of my favorite things about the podcasts, they are mostly in a calm manner. NO yelling, easy for me to understand even with my bilateral hearing aides in. Making a point without excited temperament is a gift.
This is epic rich boi content. Love it.
Lol! Should we send someone to go get it? Joe squints harder
“Pistols, rifles and shotguns can’t penetrate it…. Well a crossbow might.”
So CyberTruck will be the first car for early version of MaxTac squad. :)
😂😂😂
Jengaaa!!!!!
These two are just brilliant in their own rights
probably a 10k fridge in the garage
Methhead He-Man
I bet you $1 had me 😂
Joe looks like He-Man 😂
that truck is badass.... sadly insanely expensive an  an pretty much the entirety of the country ie. the working class will NEVER HAVE THE OPPUTUNITY TO OWN ONE.... (especially in Joe Bidens "wonderfully successful Bidenomics" {LMFAO} America. now we want to see ELON launch a arrow into Joes truck for Comparision penetration ..... you know for science and what not.
2 rich AF fools, and they are betting a dollar. Some men dont change much lol.
Hey cutie 😹😹😹
Billionaire Bets a Dollar.
Can you look any richer than randomly deciding to have your friend shoot arrows at your futuristic truck, while smoking a cigar and drinking whisky?? Lmao these people
it still looks ugly
this was cool. did you see the spark?
Just saying that with Elon having his eyes set on Mars, death via arrow ricochet would’ve been the last way we thought he’d go out
Fukk I wanted to see it penetrate the window!! Anyway, keep in mind that modern cars are doing everything they can to 1) increase fuel economy 2) have crush zones to protect occupants during a crash -  heavy steal doors or bodies in general will not do either.
Why is JOE wearing a blonde wig ??  And why is... NO ONE mentioning it ?? 😮😮😮😂😂😂🎉❤❤❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤❤❤🎉❤
I cant get over that these two are among the most influential men on the planet 😂😂😂. Love it 👍👍
So we're just gonna ignore that Joe looks like He-Man in a jersey shirt?
that exploded like something in farcry ...
Flippen loved this
Well sell them to us Elon. Quite yapping about the damn thing and make them.
I'll probably never own a Tesla, but love Elon Musk.
One of the coolest things I've seen in a while
whats the thing with this wig is joe turning liberal😂
Joe Rogan and Elon Musk are a match made in heaven, they are 2 superpowers coming together
The best DUO!
This is how super rich old men play
🤣🤦🏻‍♂️🤣👍🏻🤣
$1 bet but a Body Shop will still charge you 50k to buff that out,
We need to be honest about the cyber truck at some point. It's Ugly.
Why the fuck do you want a Truck that does Zero to 100 in less than 3 Seconds for fucks sake
The three second cyber truck would make the perfect police cruiser. Long range, catch speeders immediately with no chase, bulletproof, perfect for PIT maneuvers and low cost to operate.
Tesla stock might shoot up off this video 😮
LOLLL. The camera man needs to just buy a fuckin iPhone. JEEZ.
I’m impressed, that broad head would slick through a Camry Cross
Bless Joe, He was moving that fringe like it was the real deal.
That was an expensive shot
Gotta love the Prince Adam wig 😂
Hey, Elon, Martin Scorsese’s aviator does a good job at showing how difficult manufacturing is when he is trying to design planes.
It looks like Joe has cured Elon autism a bit
Safety was first I see, just squint if that broadhead were to ricochet back into an eye.
Joe looks like paddy pimblett
So 7000lbs 0-60 under 3 seconds. Hope they have huge breaks that won’t overheat and fail after multiple pulls
Was there two cyber trucks in there or was that a ice maker
OK as a Brit I have to admit that this video clip is an example of why America is truly great.  Two guys free to do what they want to do,  both with a complete can do spirit,  both wise and intelligent,  both pioneers in the true sense.  Thank you Joe and Elon, God Bless America.
The arrow didn't even penetrate the steel door and inside I bet the truck have armour stopping fabrics. Because a 45 go straight troug that thin Steel layer and he claims it is bulletproof do gotta be more than that first layer
A Ranch Fairy arrow would have had a better chance!!!  LOL
This is the most Joe Rogan title ever
Id want to be behind something
Carol Channing is an archer....
Camera guy, spit your gum out next time. Yuck.
Joe rogan is looking like your average transmission these days 🌈😅
I don’t care what anybody says the cyber truck can’t take a AR15 round and if it does that means it was modified but the every day cyber truck won’t be able to BUT ELONS CYBER TRUCK BETTER BE BULLET PROOF a AR15 can go through close to a half inch of steel that truck would be MUCH MUCH MORE heavier
Joe is dressed exactly like the kind of guy we'll see stepping out of a cyber truck. 🤮
You owe the richest man in the world $1.
Rap artists are going to ditch the Escalade and start using the cybertruck
It seem to me, that rather then find a way to convince people that ev car are green (wich aren' t AT ALL) Elon try to divert the attention on power, 0-55 mph and other nonsense. But then, how about to talk about the fact that to drive this Cybertruck you need a truck driving license because of its weight? How abou to talk of its lithium based battery, who are considered by law DANGEROUS AND POTENTIALLY EXPLOSIVE material and a lorry driver need a special ADR driving license to transport it? Then, since Elon has pushed to brake record for ev car on Nurburgring with the model S Plaid: do you know that  a termic engine sedan with half the power has done the lap faster? Do you know the best lap for ev cars was signed by  the WV ID, a racing prototype, with 6 minute and 5 second, but the record is holded by Porsche 919 wuth 5 minute 19 second?  Again, try to make a drag race with a top fuel and see what happen... Reality is that ev cars sell just because governments give incentives...
speed is penetration not size.
What up guys, sending love!
Impressive
Bulletproof trucks seem necessary nowadays.
Dayum.  Barely Dented it.
A crossbow would like a joke
0 to 60 in less than three seconds, but only gets 100 miles before needing a recharge.  Child slave labor using up RARE EARTH MINERALS that should not be wasted on CAR BATTERIES!
we all know in the real world if this was 8pm we would be onto the m2 machine gun by 10pm and trying the carl gustav by 11.
"I'll bet you a dollar" says the billionaire to the millionaire. 😂
Joe Rogan talking to Elon Musk out here looking like Anton Chigurh lol
Cyber trucks are for high status individuals to evade armed angry impoverished mobs
This is entertainment
Elon is a South African, and he knows we need that around here
Fun fact Joe Rogan is only 4FT 9 inch tall
Police departments all across the country should buy Cybertrucks for their officers.  If it saves a few lives it would be worth the extra cost.   Not to mention with a 2.9sec to 60mpg makes it quite an interceptor.  Oracle does the police software and they should join forces with Tesla to create the ultimate police vehicle.
If he'd kept the wig on, that would've been the greatest internet moment of all time
Love seeing them talk, Joe is like the most relatable person on earth and Elon is just incredible to listen to
IS IT IN THE NAME?  JOE ROGAN HAS AS MUCH SMARTS AS BIDEN DOES
I want that fucking  truck.  Holy shit.
Thumbnail 💯
Well...now we know 😂
Joe and Elon always interesting!
Getting some Jimmy Savile vives from Joe in that wig !  FYI - that's not good 😂
Two of the coolest people on youtube and in the world!
that was pretty cool :D
God Bless the both of you!
I can't be the only one thinking this is the weirdest comment section....
With the blond wig and cigar, I dont think Joe should have gone for the Jimmy Savile look
I'm excited to see this in a crash test. It's not safer to be more rigid , that's why they make crumple zones. To help dissipate the energy.
The truck is now worth more with the dent ironically
We all know what it means when you dress like a girl it means you been compromised. That's the old Hollywood. Humiliation ritual. So all this thoughts and feelings about transgender Bud light buys MMA and now Joe Rogan stressing like a girl interesting correlation
Crossbows are no wear near as powerful as any compound bow about 60lbs.  And Joe is talking 90lbs.  Compound bows are  crazy scary.  It's going through the sheet metal.
I would like to see the Jaws of Life applied to the truck.
Yeah i wish i could afford one of those! What about the glass though.. That's what i thought was gonna be tested, but it should have worked with the glass. Maybe..
Can you also make it not look like it was built in someone's garage? Looks like something built to chase tornados....
Otherwise known as proof we are in the weirdest timeline.
You should try the bow on normal car see if does anything
Looks like I’m gonna have to order a cybertruck
First of all you can armor plate any car and have the same effect. Nothing really special about Tesla or elon's thing.😅😅  Second of all that thing couldn't BE more ugly. 😅😅 But 90% of the new cars being made nowadays are straight corporate looking and just straight boxy and ugly...😂😂🤦🤦   No creativity or imagination👌🤣
Joe, makes extremely good choices in friends, if not in safety.
5.7 and 10mm just entered the chat...
No safety glasses and no barriers. Just men living in the moment and displaying once again why women live longer
the camera man chewing gum was super annoying
Do anyone knows what joe is dress about?
This might be my favorite podcast yet smoking cigars and shooting a arrow at a cyber truck. Genius on Elon.
Joe be looking like XQC
Why can't EVs look good?  The CyberTruck is hideous.
That was an interesting test 😎🤙
Do the fight…
Elon love coming back!!
it sparked too. great moment
Joe, you got that dolla you owe elon? Here to collect😂😂
Elon was my idol until he started supporting russia and bought twitter. Now he's just a rich autistic man
Dude grew up in  South Africa, DUH of course he builds a bulletproof truck without trying- LOL!!
😂
But is it EMP proof?
Half a million views in an hour lol... this is surely the most legendary podcast clip in history.
2 members of "The Swarm" influencing the masses
Why does Joe have his He-Man wig on!?! LMAO.
Epic 😂 I think the cutaway is a JRE first, no?
His hair grows fast. We think that it looks good on him
They’re just showing us how much impact out weapons will have after this financial crash
Elon holding that cigar like some European Nazi in a movie
He is preparing his self for the apocalypse.
Joe with a wig on is too distracting
🏹
also why is he point that a truck needs to be tough but then produces something like that? does the avergae truck owner need a bulletproof truck or does it just need something reliable to work  with? i guess itll just be something to brag about when it makes no difference
Joe and Elon fr be testing things we wanna know but can’t afford 😭
It's hard to take joe seriously with that wig on, id be laughing the whole time if I was elon
Did you know Elon musk is African?
Elon said to joe "I Bet You A Dolla you can't shoot through the truck😂😂
Elon's not so subtle burp at 5:50
Bro. The person recording has a mouth full of pop rocks or what? Jesus christ thats annoying
is that a PR shirt?? 🇵🇷🇵🇷 wepa
If Hulk Hogan have a brother it's got to be Joe with blonde hair.... 😂
Who's the twatwaffle smacking his gum!?
These two together are something special i have to admit it  dang rogan you humanized this lizard
Elon looks great man. My dude is changing the 🌎 and being a badass while he does
This was a weird ad lol
Joe Rogan is going to kill Elon Musk by cigar
And that ladies and gentlemen is Fk you Money 😂
What's with the wig😂😂😂😂
Cyber truck is such a stupid car. Lol
The key to penetrating thick armor with a crossbow or bow is a custom-made arrow. It has to be made of solid spring steel and has to be thin with a needle-like cold forged arrow tip. Similar to a harpoon but thinner. Regular bolts and arrows shatter upon impact and that way most of the energy gets wasted.
"Mom, can you drive us to Joe's house so we can pick up his Bow. I promise we won't shoot anything important with it."
Coming from 30 years in the collision industry….. those panels would be a moe foe to fix rather than replace. Be like trying to pull a truck frame with a uni spot
Why is Joe Rogan wearing a fkn wig???
Elon does not have a clue on how to hold that cigar lol he probably has people for that lol I would
LMAO, Joe grew some curly blonde locks!
I’m laughing so hard in the first minute trying to take joe serious hahahaha
Happy Halloween
Who the fuck is chewing gum like it's a god damn glizzy?!
Headline. "Freak accident from ricochet arrow kills billionaire"
Greatest JRE video of all time.
Elon desperately wants to be well-liked… in a way that’s so unlikable lol.
ah yes lets have a 7000 pound metal truck be able to go 0-60 in under 3 seconds
Omg that outfit Elon has looks like he is ”The Emperor of the New World” 😍
When you and your rich buddies get drunk and shot arrows at a 100k truck for fun
Joe looks different. Did he lose weight?
Wow that was impressive ❤
These are some the richest guys around and they're filming with an iPhone 3? No autofocus, no OIS, wtf... whoever did this should be fired.
Impressive Elon you champ everything you said and more
joe standing straight on wall elon is worried about a direct ricochet is funny asf huge props to joe.
Joe in the next Expendables.
Electric cars are a big fail.  Destroying the planet for a technology with no future.
as someone who lives in Chicago, I suddenly see the appeal to this truck XD
A phallic celebration with Mollach, wow fun times for Halloween !
can see alot of vip buying this up
I was sold when Musk asked. "trucks are supposed to be tough, cyber truck stops bullets. Is your truck bullet proof? Cyber truck is."  And 0-60 in under 3 seconds, And can tow and haul like any 3,/4 ton . Probably better.  I would think making it more capable than gas or diesel trucks would be a goal before bullet proofing. Musk does not disappoint.
Dude makes his car bullet proof... This guy is a super villan lol
They’ve become friends off the internet too and you can tell ❤ great podcast
None of those shotgun nine mil or forty five will do the same amount of damage as that compound boat with a heavy arrow and a solid point on it. I've watched those kinds of arrows go through a plate like It was no problem. So that is extraordinarily impressive
Joe looks like the Adam before he turns into He-Man.
joe looking like heman lol
WOW i want the cyber truck for my wife and kids.
Elon seems to comfortable talking to JR.... LEGENDARY
😂 fkn love elon!
Billionaire shhh seems fun😂
oooh Elon's back! good day folks i have to scoot over to Spotify 🙏🏻
Man, if i shot my homies truck he wpuld kill me, revive me then kill me again.
There is still a kid in them. Love it.
I never thought I would see the day Joe Rogan wearing a team Puerto Rico with blond hair 🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
I forget that Joe’s just a lil fella.
I’m not gay but joe can be my joleen looks fit
🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
Elon is the GOAT of promising without delivering.
Dented elons new truck lol
Joe is the 2023 HE-MAN REBOOT
It is obvious joe was not at the battle of Agincourt. They did not shoot flimsy broadheads from 80 pound bows at the knights. Call Jörg Sparve and unleash him on the cyber-"no more"-truck. As a last resort the trebuchet will be erected.
How did he get through this without laughing..I can’t even look at joe.
Can someone explain to me why the fuck Joe has blonde hair
sweeeeet. take podcast moble more!
I'm dumbfounded on how tough that truck is.
Very very impressive 👏 good show. 👍
Joe Rogan is literally 4'18" tall
I would love to see Joe's face when he gets the bill for the door from Elon.
wow I wish I could afford a Cyber truck although I can afford a compound bow
Joe owes Elon a dollar🤣
If your channel radicalized individuals that comment crimes, how do you ban that?
Hi, Elon. I'm Nicolle. I need to drive a Cyber Truck. Please help me out. We can go drive it in the desert. It would be fun. Hit me up. 🤣
Even elons laugh sounds rich 😂
It's still an IMPRACTICAL, INEFFICIENT and definitely NOT GREEN EV that will be like all EV's, grazing in the Tall-Grass behind "Earl's Shop"!!  Gotta have mad respect for Elon though, he duped all the Volt-Dolt greenies into paying for his true love, Space X. 🤣
The most guy outcome imaginable. “Hey, do you think I could fire an arrow through your car door?” “LOL, no way, but, sure, let’s go out and try.”
I am convinced. I am getting a cyber truck.
This is so good!
Bruce Jenner wants your number
These two delinquents hahaha love it 😂
Joe dressing up like the lady at the baseball game is awesome lol
Where is that dollar Joe?
I'd love to see the insurance claim on that dent. ;) or will it 'polish out' ?
Joe: I wanna shoot your car with a bow Elon : ye, why not, let’s do it rn
But it's NOT a "truck" stop pretending.
This clip is going to do some ironman numbers
What is joe dressed as haha
The nuerolink is the sign everyone should be paying attention to,this thing existed in the past.The prophecy of the mark of the beast is older than Jesus revelation. It's been here since the beginning. I believe we are stuck in a time loop and they can send their consciousness to the past in order to try to change the future.This cycle will end.Wormwood wants to heal the blind but fails to mention they can technically tap into the chip and see what you see.
Why is Joe wearing a wig? Is he trying to impersonate He-Man during a mid-life crisis?
six thousand sixty six lbs. that’s all for beast mode version.   It’s all jokes
Lol this is awesome!
Now get the Slow mo Guys and Destin from Smarter Everyday and try this. Seriously, it'd be fascinating.
Pretty bad ass
Elon and Joe both smoking blunts .
Maybe an English armour piercing arrow head…. And that’s a big fucking maybe.
Notice how effortlessly Joe drew the bow?  It takes me a LOT more effort to do that. He did it in like 1/4 second like it was nothing. Dude's legit strong for sure.
That was very dangerous.
What’s funny is that cyber truck is probably worth more now
Just step back and take a couple seconds to imagine the implications of people having a mass produced bulletproof truck with optionally bulletproof glass. One the one hand, it will make it harder for deranged people to do deranged things against you. On the other hand, it will make it easier for deranged people to do deranged things to you and police if they are in operation of the vehicle. The best part? Too early to say.
These two guys are efin fun crazy 😂😂😂
Really enjoyed it 😂😂😂
Joe looks like a super alcoholic roofer eith that wig on
So Elon won a dollar and got a messed up door😂
To your viewers here in the UK, you look exactly like Jimmy Saville, with the blonde wig and the cigar.  If you don't know who Jimmy Saville is then you should look him up.
this is dope
Elon is a thug bruh, i love this guy
I was hoping to get to hear the mass vs velocity debate between Elon and Joe.
Elons laugh should be sampled and sent on a new Golden Record.
Joe just look like gaga so cute i ike him 😘😘😘😘😘😍😍
"it's bulletproof to handguns"  dumbass joe: duuuuuuuuuurrrr let me shoot a primitive weapon into it
Man you both are wilding this Halloween 😂😂 love it guys. 😂❤
“I’ll bet you a dollar” Elon is the man 😂. I don’t understand the hate for him.
Cybertruck, The Big Foot of the Truck World.....🤷🤦🏾‍♀️
I like when Joe grows his hair out.
I love that he was like, let's do it. We'll do this tonight. That is how things are supposed to be done. These are too great men. I'm glad to share space with and air can't say that about most men.
Joe looks like He-Man here 😭😂
So was joe paid to do this and act like it was spontaneous?
it actually seems like they are friends now. Elon seems way more comfortable on the show now.
I love these two dudes!
Kinetic energy scales with velocity squared. Mass only linearly. Concentrate that in the smallest area for best results.
i love that he bet a dollar!
Oooo I like her.
Elons joke in the full episode when they are talking briefly about stars, Jamie mentions one called Sirius, and Elon says: "you cannot be serious."  Literally funnier than Rogan's entire comedy career.  Only to be confirmed by Rogan following Elon's joke up with his own..  Joe: "Sirius XM"  *slow clap*  Wow....
Dibs on the scratch and dent CyberTruck
That was epic. I’d love if they made an ICE version of the cyber truck…
Joes the only person who's managed to get elon to drink whisky, smoke weed and a cigar, he's like that bad influence you need to avoid but can't get rid of 😂
Joe looks like Jimmy Saville
What is Elon dressed as?
Some of my favorite episodes are with Elon.  He's One Fascinating Dude!!!
This is so gangster. 👏👏👏
The bro-mance with Elon & Joe grows 🥰🥰🥰
4 minutes in I realized Joe is wearing a he-man wig lmao I gotta quit smoking while I watch this shit 🤣
That wig is hilarous. Who is is dressed as?
I would rather spend 30 years in a prison cell with joe or elon than 30 seconds with kylie jenner at the ritz-carlton.
So what happens when the cyber truck rear ends a Prius. Just obliderates what ever it crashes into???
What is Joe supposed to be wearing? Is that a Halloween outfit?
elon laughs like an evil villain ready to take over the world
"I"ll bet you a dollar"  Headline:  Musk and Rogan arrested for illegal gambling conglomerate .
You can tell that Joe was slightly annoyed that he couldn't shoot an arrow through the door.
Elon needed this pr boost right now
Why tf is Joe dressed like Patty the baddy?
Wut
Joe would make one ugly blond chick weeefff imagine waking up next to that😂😂
Pissed he took the wig off for the shot.   Also, you know Elon probably wouldn’t let Joe shoot at the window.
Didnt think it would spark like that.
This video made me realize something. Joes built like a midget space marine 😂
I can’t take joe serious looking like someone’s auntie
Wepa joe 🤙🏽
in theory you can buy the cyber truck and have your LLC own it and its 100% a tax write off.  Anything over 6,000 lbs.
03:11 - such a "we're rich, we DGAF" moment haha
So basically in the future most  police and military vehicles will be Cybertrucks.
still one of the ugliest vehicles of all time.  Great to know the world's richest human, who could single-handedly cure hunger, homelessness and give people healthcare is putting all those resources to good use.
"You built it like this just for fun?" (Elon imagining post-apocalyptic resource warfare)
That is seriously impressive.  American made and actually tough.
These guys are worse than the maffia. Don’t get rogan and Elon mad. I think you can not hide on this planet 😂
he knows shit is about to hit the fan so he is selling a bulletproof truck for all his billionaire and millionaire friends
Yu shown arrow Elon aye my car🤬💯🫡🤣
Elons laugh dude 😂😂😂
Btw, Joe needs to pay Elon 1 dollar. 😄 🤣 😂
This cybertruck will be perfect for Chicago
Btw, Joe needs to pay Elon 1 dollar. 😄 🤣 😂
police chases will be interesting
I love every second of this.
it's the "hey cutie" with Dracula's laugh for me
Made for the South African market
did Joe get a different haircut of something?
whoever was chewing gum in the mic duing the test ,you know what you are
Whoever it is that is holding the camera and chewing the gum, I swear to God, you made me cringe to the point that I closed the video multiple times and lowered the volume because of you, WHO CHEWS LIKE THAT, ARE YOU A CAMEL ?????
When i clicked this video, i was expecting metaphorical “arrow shooting”, not real arrows
beast mode? bring in marshawn lynch for the debut!
this is the stuff I like. Crossbows and Cybertrucks. MORE PLZ!
This looks preplanned...
This will probably boost tales.
the fact that they ACTUALLY went down and did is so raw lmao love it!
Joe, looks like a retired Heman.
What about the joker and his bazooka
A bullet travels 3 times as fast I think. So, a 125 grain bullet is going to have a 375 grain worth of energy if related to the arrow. But the arrow had that needle like tip. I think hardness is a major factor. To create tank buster missiles we tip them with tungsten. If Joe had an arrow like that I bet it’d rip through.
In reality, you should position yourself behind the wheel/axel opposite of firing direction.
Joeeee its a honor to see you with that jersey🥲🥲🥰🥰🇵🇷
When im that age, i wann be just like Joe Roegan! :D What a cool guy haha :D  And love it how Elon just said lets do it :D
Penetrator head Is 4 sided like a nail no broad blades just stream line. It cuts a square that splits the steel. Or put a battery in a aluminum tube and some gun poder with a primer
Why the hell did he take OFF the Prince Valiant wig!!
Men will be men ❤
Ohhh   Elon....how we wish we could have that big brain, but also how to use it... with a big heart.
Bruh this the blokiest bloke guys being guys who are rich moment ever on a podcast!
I would like to see 10mm.
It was like yea fk it let's do it xD
Thats actually pretty impressive!
I just can't wait for my RN to come up for the cybertruck...
whoever was filming and chewing their gum like a fucking cow made the arrow demonstration almost unwatchable. You can't close your fucking mouth while you film? Seriously?
Jou to Joe?wtf.😮
Now i can only imagine when Elon or any next owner stopping his truck at every crossroad stop getting shot by archers with their arrows or gansters flushing their tommies just to try for fun. Going to be crazy lol...
yes!!! trucks are supposed to be tough! i want a cyber truck.
We need a A-Team cyber Van. Les't go Elob❗(Cyber Tough)
Don’t modern cars have crumple zones for safety? God help someone getting into an accident in that thing
Joe Rogan looks 20 years younger with his new cut 😂
Well. Now we know! 😂
I recall seeing the Bonnie And Clyde car on display once at a Casino in Laughlin Nevada. It had velvet ropes around it but you could reach over and put your fingers into the bullet holes in the car doors where the shots killed Bonnie and Clyde. It was very thick metal but also the holes were very large. It would be interesting to know what kind of bullets they used. They must have been a massive caliber.
close your god dman mouth when chewing mate
Only in 'Murica
I bet the police force will start ordering these vehicles. No more cops getting shot inside their vehicles.
Awesome
3:14 here is what you’re here for.
With all the shootings in states, I think the truck will save somebodys life one day
Is that a Latvian flag on Rogans arm?
Great move by Musk
Very impressive
What an ugly truck.
Forget bullets and arrows, how will this perform in a fire storm burn over?
sheeeesh
Joe you look good as a blond
Joe is looking old
Thus podcast was literally one of the GOAT podcasts.
Any military contracts for that truck? Also this vehicle will come in handy for bank robbers.
JR shooting Elons batmobile with a freaking bow and arrow 😂
so nice listening to the guy chewing gum in my ear. ass wipe
He's lying
W
Elon is such a Humble bad ass. “Trucks are supposed to be tough right, is yours bullet proof?”
Whoever is behind the camera, close your damn mouth when you chew 🙄 soundin like a fricken giraffe
These two people may save humanity and I’m not sure how to feel about that.
Best pod cast ever!
Another wonderful episode of "Elon Musk talks about shit that's never going to be released"
Joe looking like jimmy savile 😂😂😂
more elon internet for palestine please :)
He built it incase he was at thst location and had to dtive to his underground mountain location.
WHO THE FUCK IS CHEWING NEXT TO THE MIC!?!?!
In the garage the only thing i hear is the camera guy chewing the fuck out of his gum.😂😂😂😂😂😂
“Well now we know” 😂😂😂
Honestly a no lose situation for Elon, if it goes thru he can say it’s not arrow proof, if it stops it can say it stops arrows too.  Regardless of what you think of Tesla vehicles, to have that level of physical security in a (eventually) consumer level car is pretty cool.
As soon as I saw the CT I knew it'd be my daily. Beast mode. It's replacing a 96 camry wagon, manual, so big shoes to fill for reliability and DGAF/carparking whatever.. I can't wait to get my hands on it. Imagine what it can handle up-armoured LOL?
So glad Elon is on team C
Willy Wonka Musk
probably the best promo you could do for tesla and cybertrucks
The 14 year old in me thought that was the coolest thing ive seen. I would have been running into home room saying you’ll have to see this
What about a rocket launcher?
Gentlemans bet for a dollar,lol.
AI is getting crazy
Joes needs a SIDE STEP to get into that thing
JOE:  wtf is on your head?  LOL!
They look like two highschool kids trying to appear cool. Honestly stop confusing vapid behaviour as a true source of entertainment.
The fact that a man as wealthy as Musk is willing to make a $1 bet just for fun (and bragging rights) shows real class.
Why Elon talking to Jimmy Sav…..oh it;s joe
Space is fake Joe
What gives with Rogan wearing the blond wig ?
Now we know apache cant assasinate you when your in the Cyber truck
But remember the time Elon smashed out the windows live on stage?! 😂😂 Can we get another demonstration on that please??
What is joe dressed as? He man?
JOE YOU REMIND ME OF MY AUNT FOR SOM REASON 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
that was awesome...
Elons blunder. Like his Thermonuclear proof windows on his semi, The panels are just covering a frame. It's like a Delorean, The panels are a nightmare to keep clean and fix scratches.
Going on Rogan has as much reach as a Super Bowl commercial…and it’s free
4:03 is how Elon laughs when 1 out of 1000s of kids from his cobalt mine slave camps dies on "the job"
I cant wait to pick up mine!
Jimmy Saville isn’t a good look Joe!
"i dont want to give it all away right now" translates to 'we're nowhere near production, let just keep everyone guessing'  But the doors on his one off look strong.
That wig is perfect looked like Howie on Benchwarmers.
😂
Still these ugliest “truck” in the world, and who cares if you can’t shoot a arrow in it, so dumb
Money looks FUN!
That is cool.
25,000 damage tho
Whoever was snacking their gum while recording the aerosine needs to be dealt with
The Jimmy Savile hair adds 20 years to Rogan. He looks like a dead pro wrestler.
Joe's Halloween costume is friggin hilarious
epic
Shoot to thrill!!   Nice wig Joe, Cheese and Rice!!!!
Who the hell is chewing behind the camera
Two people out of touch, one MASSIVELY out of touch. Ewrong.
Why is Joe waring a wig ?
This is great Marketing!  Just go do something.  Record it.  Send it.
Field point would have had more of a chance.
I love how Elon is down for whatever.  Super chill
I want rich friends!!!!
this is the life
EV's are going to fail badly. Good luck.
Dang
Love the new look
Your not fooling any one, Joe, we know it was you at the football/soccer game.
Is that you Joe? https://youtu.be/A7IMBnMU5a4?si=CDLtHtu-IUQXJBna
Why does joe think his bow and arrow is stronger than. .45ACP ?
🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
4:10 Barely scratched it?! You cut away real quick but it made one nasty dent and one smaller.
Rogan has longer hair than I remember
how is this not 1 on trending lol or even on trending at all
I guess Elon wanted to make a truck for people in Chicago.
what a nice talk !!!! thank u !!
The f… is in joe rogan head
I though it was aimed at the window
God, for all of the extreme EVIL in the world, watching these two (who have NO ego, who simply want truth and facts) interact, is like breathing pure oxygen!!
Joe's face under fluorescent lighting looks like an aged baseball glove. 😂 Also, if a bullet can't penetrate the thing, what the hell made him think an arrow could? 🤔🤨
No he needs to be 100- 200 meters in distance for tha  arrow to catch speed
Re-label it to CyberTank.
Spotify isn't uploading bra
Why is Joe wearing that wig? 😆
These mf's need to rule the world 🌎 ... hell yeah
I'm not into electric vehicles but I would consider the cyberTruck simply for the fact that it is bulletproof and arrow proof.
Soo sick! 😂
So basically a cartel truck. Cartels gonna go craaaaaazy
bro the gum chewing
I FUCKING LOVE ELON, DON'T CARE WHAT ANYBODY SAYS!
The most gangster thing about this is Elon only betting a dollar
I forgot it was Halloween
Why does the guy at 3:13 look like Messi?
Joe..  Disguise as Puertorican Team Rubio. 😏
Legendary
Is Joe Bruce Vilanch for Halloween?
Sick and Awesome
LOL!!! This is awesome!!
He should market those trucks in Chicago
WTF is the point of this? Mad Max?
I'm trying to watch. But, I just can't with the wig Joe! I can't take any of this seriously!
What's with the wig Joe? Did you lose another bet?
I cancelled my order...
Arrow vs Bullet hmmmmmm……🤔
Love this pairing
Due to the cyber trucks, wait is going to be a tax write off in multiple ways. Commercial weight like the Mercedes G wagon. Same same deal. He's a genius. He's creating a free car
4:04 supervillain laughs be like
Elon Muskateer 💪
The types of rounds, the Cybertruck for sure cannot stop are Rifle Rounds.
i have no idea how to explain but this is just cool to watch
Este Episodio es todo ORGULLO BORICUAAAAAA
I love that a billionaire says I'll bet you a dollar! 😂😂😂 i love elon musk cause there are comedians on here who've tried to bet thousands 😂😂😂
great cop cars. I love this show just rabbit hole after rabbit hole!
Why is there no footage of anyone shooting the windows??
it's old video or latest ?
A target tip probably make a slight hole
JOE LOOKS LIKE BARNEY RUBBLES BROTHER
Joe be looking like He-Man, the pronoun master of the universe
What's with the wig joe
When Elon said “I’ll bet you a dollar” he meant a million
But what about the windows?
Yeah Joe,  I wouldn't bother going home to get that 90lb draw bow. That 80lb velocity was impressive, still gauge of metal for broad tips is for penetration of living skin and flesh 💁‍♂️
This is great! You know what’s not great? The freakin gum chewer 🤢
He's building them because when humanity figures out what he's really upto he's going to need it.
Now try it with cartel calibers 7.62 x 51 & .308
Elon looks similiar to schwarzaneger
I am over the both of you.  Elon is just a hype guy, Joe is just the kiss ass. 😘
Can both of them become president of the world please?
Imagine cartel dudes get ahold of these things, I’m sure they already have but if not that’d be crazy
Try crossbow ten point
Joe Rogan is literally 5'2"..
Cyber truck is so ugly
I'm broke, and I'm watching a billionaire and a multi millionaire smoking cigars in dress up and betting 1 dollar to shoot an arrow through someone's truck.
Elon looks like a human this time
Imagine some of those criminals using this
Musk’s laugh after shooting arrow at truck was so evil !!
The guy chewing in to the mic while filming...you bastard.
they're so weird lol!
This is so amazing. What a great guys. Should we try it…yeee .. right now .. yeee… omg this is good videos
So these comments are all written by ChatGPT, right?
Two absolute beauty Dudes talking guy stuff. Doing manly things.  Keep up the cool Sh*t
Funny how transphobes are always so eager to crossdress 😂
No in depth questions like what happened to the self driving car Elon talked about on his last appearance
Gotta love Elon!
Try a 30-06 🤣🤣
There is no entertainment like this anywhere. Interesting and informative.
Hey cutie👋 HA HA HA HA they are good friends for sure😂
God damn, Elon is so awesome, "sure, lets do it now!" Joe, alright! 💥💥💥💯💯💯💯💯
That was awesome
The Bay area is about to be full of them bullet proof and windows cant be broken.  SF and Oakland mayor should buy these for tourist to rent
I love the ballistics discussion about a Cybertruck door.
Told you Joe wasn’t fooling nobody 😂😂😂
If Shemp dyed his mop hair blonde.
Joe looks like Ken Masters from Street Fighter 8
how's Elon a chill guy here but an absolute douche on Twitter/X
Joe Rogan looks like He-Man!
I did not have "Joe shoots Elon's Cybertruck with an arrow" on my bingo card today.  This is the wildest timeline.
Joe's wig kills me 😂 love this interaction
That's quite a big stabilizer Joe 👌
Soooo not to be that guy but I think Joe owes Elon some money
Lmfao I love Joe’s outfit so much and the way elon laughs at 2:58 and ends with “sick” 😂
I love Elon's laugh. 😆
I was like wtf is wrong with joe why he got a wig is he wiggin out and then I remembered it was halloween ha ha
I would love to meet Elon - he's so grounded with life.
Beppa Joseph
25-30 feet? I must say that is impressive!
Joe looks like hs gonna off someone with a air comprssor 😂
LOL - billionaire bets a dollar😂❤
My favorite person in the whole wide world ❤️
But the windows ain’t stopping jack so what’s the point
it's Ma'am!
Pay up Joe!
How can this not make you smile. That was awesome.
Can the camera man stop chewing bubblegum? It makes me sick
Puertorrican Baseball player Joe Rogan is a sight to behold.
I Joe going for the Marilyn Monroe look or the He Man Look?
On the list of coolest shit ever
Knoxville, Knoxville!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3xZgMlrRW4
This was so cool. I loved to see this. 2 of my top 5 guys, chillin, a few stoagies, a few Whiskeys and just rediculously whipping out a compound bow right there and then and shooting a Tesla truck with it. Oh my days...
Joe doing drag,suits him.
No way that was going to penetrate.
Kurt Cobain is alive
As a huge tesla stock owner I actually was afraid to click on this video. And within the first 5 sec my heart rate SHOOT up like crazy. What on earth is going on here, Joe?
I was trying to figure out what he was dressed as! That’s hilarious
The coolest smartest billionaire on earth .
Who's the camera man 😂
lol i forgot it was halloween and i lterally thought joe was doing a gag and elon musk was just dressing like that
Elon just freakin rocks.  Hands down.   lol
Cars exteriors are soo thin these days, I have to be careful when washing my Camaro.. You can flex the metal just by pushing a bit too hard, literally the roof is so thin you can deflect it with one finger..
Did Joe lose a bet an have to wear a wig?
a millionaire and a billionaire walk into an archery range....
🇵🇷
I cant take Joe seriously 😂😂😂
Worlds richest African
Man Wtf, couldn't go through this when Joe looks like this
Smart people. Help me understand how an arrow can, but a bullet can't.
Why in the hell is he wearing that wig
Bullet proof truck straight out the factory😳! Sign me up🔥
Elons laugh is the best thing! HA HA HA HA HA 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
In that damn wig, Rogan comes across like a version of Jimmy "the Savage Beast" Savile.
Joe! You're glowing! Are you transitioning?!?!
Did you pay the $1 bet?
Wtf is he wearing and why 😂🤣😂
Waste of money, you made a dent with arrow, imagine a 9mm
Damn, Joe shoots a 90 lb bow?! That's a pretty heavy draw
could it be that the a-team has reinforced car doors on the van?
"Where’s my dollar muddah fruker"
Elon has definitely never driven a Chevy OBS. GFL sending a round thru the Ole Chevy metal
I really thought it was a ai generated video when i saw Joe's and Elons outfit
Needed a bodkin
Hide behind the engine, not the door.
Remember when Halloween used to be fire kids??? Fucking creeps...
Grams not grains dawg
Is Joe Donald Trump for Halloween?😂
Not a fan of electric cars but that’s impressive!
The way Elon smokes his cigar is very un-human
So, how do you repair the damage, stainless weld?
So is this one of those new A.I. clips i keep hearing about? Wtf is going on?!😂
Lets throw knives over it next time !!! :D
chunk of broadhead/arrow goes whizzing past camera man at 3:36. lucky guy
I can’t wait to get this Cybertruck! That’s going to be a BEAST of a pickup truck, good luck to ram, ford and gm your diehard fan will now have option to buy the TOUGHEST pickup truck on the market that can’t beat a corvette in 0-60, wtf!!!!!
“We dug our own grave with the Cybertruck,” Musk said.  Then Joe you shot him a coffin
Somebody teach elon how to smoke the cigar
Fuck the dude chewing his gum like a horse bro wtf
These two are how an empire looks near the end
Camera man cherws gum which ruins the whole clip. Fucking annoying
Dude is a genius! Comparison between Tesla and the big-three automakers is light-years!
What the fuck is joe wearing 💀
Didn't have this on my JRE Bingo card, gotta be honest! 😆😆  Joe - pass on this deeply needed app Share the Meal that helps kids!!
Man this is a deepfake I didn't need to see😂
is that jimmy saville?
Elon is such a bro! lol love that guy
Zero eye protection lmfao
me with my single cab 2007 tacoma 😢. at least its reliable cant say that for ford or tesla
This is why women lives longer😂😂
"Hey cutie"  👹👹👹👹👹👹
That’s actually very impressive.
4:03 Damn Elon had a strong rich laugh there buddy. seeesssshhh
damn rogan is old
Demolition Ranch time?
Joe looks like Iggy pop with that wig. 4:35
What's w the P R Jersey and whose on the back?
Blonde Anton Chigurh
Cool 👌
Joe Rohan 🥲
Now put it up for auction for 100k more so i can have bragging rights
Plate carriers laugh att bows, Joe is so deep in the right
Built the truck like  that for the impending you know whats to come
Go Puerto Rico  Great shirt?
Demolition Ranch would love to do the "bullet proof" testing
What is with the hair?
I kinda like the truck ....
Musk so full of sh!t 😂
Bring the truck to demolition ranch or give one to whistlindiesel and see how it makes out. Oh the content you could create.
just some rich-people game going on here, nothing to see
This is like a gd fever dream. 😅
He looks like Anton Chigurh in that wig
Confused why Joe's wearing a Puerto Rico👕w/his P.A.for🇺🇦 get up(I memory blocked what that freak's handle is, that Zelensky had no idea was working in 🇺🇦govt)
How come nobody told the cameraman to stop licking his fucking lips during the cybertruck part
Joe: I got the POWER!!!! HE-MAN
Just randomly landed on this video and I’m not understanding what’s goin’ on…Am I on acids?
Joe, you look like He-Man. 😂
Shoot the glass!!! Booooo
He needs to shoot an arrow at a regular car so we have a control sample XD
From the thumbnail and the title I thought this was a PINGTR1P edit.
jfc elon is cringe
3:09 Mark my words, Elon musk standing smoking a cigar, whisky in hand watching joe fire an arrow at his cyber truck will become an iconic meme template, I’m calling it.
Why does Joe look like Jimmy Saville smoking that cigar 😂
Il take two and il gift one to the crazy women who keeps totaling her cars
He good!  Every mob boss and head gangsta everywhere on the planet is now gunna get one of these trucks.
Yet no one has any 😂
3:36 If he didn't give it The Rock's eyebrow lift then the power output would've been much lower.
The way his shooting scene was shot reminded me so much of a District 9 style of filming.
gta 6 better have the cybertruck
I'll bet you a dollar
It’s like we took a field trip
Cybertruck weighs as much as an electric forklift.
These dorks talking crossbow bolt weight hahaha
If people are shooting at your car, then you can hide behind the engine block for a better chance of survival.
Guy as we are so close to the end of days. All those who don’t currently believe in the Lord Jesus Christ need to get one of those with a solar charger.  Because you will not be able to buy petrol without the microchip.
Joe definably lost at poker
The Bros just bro-ing.😂
This is how dudes work
Joe saying "Lets do it" with so much confidence and taking a fat rip from the cigar was clean 🤣
Why is Jamie chewing gum while recording. That sounded nasty.
My question is, can the fire department's jaws of life cut through it to rescue someone?
I remember not long ago 0-60 in 5 seconds was moving. Now it's just absurd lol.
“Well now we know”
He-Man Podcast
Joe representin’ all us dirty Puerto Rican Irish kids.
That's insane
i mean. this is just fcking cool
Why the Puerto Rico jersey?😂😂
J: “And you built it like this just for fun?”  E: “Trucks are supposed to be tough right?”  J: “yeah”  E: “So… Is your truck bullet proof?”
BULLET-FUCKING-PROOF!!! SOLD!!!  I'm all in, FUCK THE GRID. All hail Tesla 🙌 Btw, some one give Joe his Darwin Award 🏆😅
Joe I love your costume 😂🤣🇵🇷
Make a limo SUV version .. and see world leaders line up.
At Least  we tell the Truth!!
Yeah but... the glass, tho?...
is the camera man chewing gum?
Will make a great technical
Joe hasn't turned trans has he🙈😁
Joe looks like retired he-man
Joe dropped some math bombs on Elon 😂
How is Elon having a conversation with him with a straight face? Mad props.
Say what you want about Elon. This guy spends his money on what he enjoys doing and while doing that, he's actually progressing different types of technology. People who give him shit for having ambitious plans are the same kind of people who probably mocked Da-Vinci about his flying apparatus ideas
😂
I let out the most joe rogan laugh when I saw the thumbnail and Joe’s costume
Elon wants a military contract lool
Elon “I’ll bet you a dollar” Musk
Dude, Joe looks exactly like Heman lol
3:05
He-Man really aged well
Joe looks like Moe from the Stooges with blonde hair
hell yeah!
And suddenly life is better 😂
Does the view counter for youtube trip anyone else out. You realize how many people are glued to their phone with you. Very alarming. I dont think it's an smart tactic. It just brings it to my attention that i shouldnt be watching.
A crossbow BOLT is radically different from a crossbow QUARREL. A quarrel is like a mini arrow, made of the same stuff as an arrow, only shorter. A BOLT is a heavy projectile, usually cast in one piece, out of steel or iron, fired from a heavy crossbow, the kind you have to crank a wheel for a minute and a half to charge. A three-pound bolt fired from a heavy crossbow like the kind I just described, will go in one side and out the other of the cybertruck like it wasn't even there. They were designed to break through stone and they work very well.
Elon looks like a pimp here and Joe looks like one of his $5 hookers lol
Great marketing.  Elons good at selling.
When will Joe get Charles Hoskinson on the show..
Elon definitely has teleportation technology he was ready to zip to joes house in nothing flat and come back with the bow
P1NGTRIP where u at??
That's the ugliest truck in existence
I love you guys
Elon dressing like a billionaire for the first time
it blows my mind how smart elon is
How they didnt add this car in cyberpunk is beyond me
I was waiting to see your comments about the last saturday Big Show..remember Ngannou vs Fury
Joe may be a hunter, but he shouldn't have brought up crossbow penetration to a nerd
is it just me, why Joe is looking like He-Man
That's awesome
Can we just take a moment to appreciate whoever shot the video of Joe shooting the arrow...for CHEWING GUM LIKE A COW?
Elon will save us. One day we will ALL be grateful.
Joe that’s a heavy jimmy savile look you’ve got of you don’t know who he is look him up loved a cigar as well
Is Joe losing his mind!!! How can I respect  a Girly man with a super  Trans Wig on  Stop Having Sex with Lady Boy's 😂
Well. As usual. That was interesting.
I really thought he was going to aim for the window.
Seems like a death trap in an accident.   No way to open the doors, no way for firefighters or bystanders to easily get you out.
I love how Joe switched the convo about Tesla to bows and arrows
Elon Musk is the shizzz
That's a lot of money sitting in one room
Now, THATS entertainment!
Beast mode is trademarked.
I love seeing Elon laughing it up and having a good time - he's got a lot of weight on his shoulders.
Why didn’t he shoot the glass?
WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND IS CHEWING GUM BEHIND THE CAMERA AAAAAAAAAAH! My mysophonia can't handle it 😂
That truck is hideous, looking
ayy elon musk again lets gooo
We're that much closer to Cyberpunk 2077.
joe has no idea what he is talking about i haven’t even finished the video and i know it will not go through speed it how you get through hard objects yes weight does matter to some degree but speed it key so if a 9 45 and whatever elon said didn’t get through it that bow is not
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is elon just full of shite
thats a great vision of the future right there. arrow-proof robot trucks.
The wig and cigar is not a good look considering who had hair like that and smoked a huge cigar! now then now then 🤣🤦🏻‍♂
joe rogan in  a puerto rican baseball jersey with a wig on interviewing elon musk in a hue hefner costume sounds like a fever dream relived off an acid trip
Joe is so small! Lmao
All the baddies out there ordering cyber trucks thinking "I'm invulnerable to the police!" Elon making even more money doing a deal with law enforcement, selling them the shutdown/lockdown codes on request! 😂
4:02 that's not Elon laughing like a gangsta 😭
How about the Window or the tire
I just totally love and adore the banter between these 2, could listen to them chat shit for Days. Always reminds me of the conversations i used to have as a young teen with my best buddies late at night while getting stoned :)
WHY TF IS JOE DRESSED LIKE THAT???? LMFAO
Freak accident waiting to happen
Being an American and looking at these 2 as peak human is the biggest joke in itself no wonder Joe biden is your leader what a failed society
Toyotas still not sweating.
Never thought I would never see Joe wearing a wig lmaoo
Without the wig? Like Superman without the cape 😢
Toyota will have competition in the Middle East
Work on the design of the truck Elon. It crazy how he can make such good quality vehicles but couldn't give this one not even a mediocre design. This thing is hideous, i can't even take it seriously, i would think that he's trolling with a design like that.
How unsafe are accidents now that evs are all 5-8000 Lbs?
Neuralink chips were implanted by drilling holes into the monkeys’ skulls. One primate developed a bloody skin infection and had to be euthanized. Another was discovered missing fingers and toes, “possibly from self-mutilation or some other unspecified trauma,” and had to be put down. A third began uncontrollably vomiting shortly after surgery, and days later “appeared to collapse from exhaustion/fatigue.” An autopsy revealed the animal suffered from a brain hemorrhage.
*d@mn Joe looks good with that hairs on 😁*
How cool is Elon Musk? “You want to do it now?” No prep just let’s Joe rogan shoot his car with a bow and arrow.
I love these guys lol
Loved the Spark 🙂
You should use a still close-up of the sparks on something. That was cool!
When he said I bet u a dollar that shit was gangsta
I thought Jaime was some kind of photographer. Couldn’t even focus on the broad head.
This almost feels like its ai generated hahaha
my dream car is the cybertruck
The “ I told you so!!” Moment. So good!
This is just fucking EPIC
Cybertruck - the getaway car of the future
Seriously, you look like a bunching rookies trying to hold on to those stogies. Remind of the kids who smoke just to try to fit in.
love the shirt PR🇵🇷
❤😂
Hey cutie
Joe looks like Jim laihe from tpb when he got caught with randy😂😂😂😂😂
Why is Joe wearing a wig?
RIP Joe Rogan's arrow
Is Rogan trying to rock a Jimmy Saville look? 😈
These comments can't be real. Nobody mentioning this gay xxxx happening all of a sudden!!!! YouTube is truly full of trash
The fact that Joe Rogan picked that as a Halloween costume is hilarious 🤣🤣
some fucking mouth breathing mong chewing into the camera.
WHO THE FUCK IS SMACKING THIER GUMS LIKE THAT!?
I thought Joe would ask Elon: "Have you tried to a Bear against it? Have you ever seen a Bear rage on a car?"
3:03 Message to the guy holding the camera: chew your gum louder you f*cking animal.
A generation of cartels are going to drive cybertrucks
One of the most cool things I saw in a year) who needs commercial when you have this?))😂
Will be interesting to see what happens to the Honda Civic when it get into a collision with the cyber truck going 60mph
Was the cameraman eating bee jerky? lol
FFKKMann i wanna hangout with those two 🤣❤🙏🏼 Oss !
Cyber truck is so heavy that you are allowed to drive it with your regular Car license, BUT as soon you want to hook up a trailer and use your flatbed to transport stuff, you are not allowed to drive it.... you can drive it empty, but not loaded.
Id say Joe needs to contact Maxine Waters to get some make up tips.
"Trucks are supposed to be tough, right?" "Yes." "Can you shoot your truck and hide behind it?" "No." "Not very tough, then. You can shoot the Cybertruck and hide behind it."
I really don’t know what to tell to all the haters, isn’t Elon musk one of the coolest persons ever?
Please to really are professional and making memes together😂
Tesla Stock Jump here we come! Buy Buy Buy!!!!!!!!!!!! W000000t!!!!
But why does everyone need bullet proof vehicles is this something planning for future???
These guys are real friends, no doubt. Growing up every time a friend got a new paintball gun. We tested it on another friends car 😂😂😂
Imagine telling Elon to his face that the Electric cars/trucks will be failure due the massive electric usage and the fires that are hard to put out.
Lol😅😅
Watching Joe swoosh the hair from his face is f@ckin majestic 🤣
Joe is such a big kid it’s hilarious 😂
im sorry but who the fuck actually thought an arrow was going to go through steel plate. and who the fuck is impressed it didnt.... like DUHH HELLO?   Elon: " Yeah we shot it with guns nothing went through." Caveman monkey: "ARROW BREAK IT MAYBE?"
I'm not gonna lie, if I had 100k to burn I think I would take a cyber truck over any other pickup ( I drive a Prius). Say what you will about Teslas, they are very safe vehicles, and I expect a cyber truck to be even safer.
My favorite smart person of all time
I’ll keep this in mind, next time I have an extra 100,000 dollars and buy one. Maybe I’ll suddenly get transported to the reign of Henry the Vlll and it will be a relevant test.
As a Puerto Rican I'm happy to see Joe wearing the jersey but what's with the wig 🤣
As long as we don’t have to worry about EMPs, this truck will be great after the apocalypse
what I like about Elon is that he is one of the rare CEOs who actually know the ins and outs of their products to the base details. Something even like how much a truck is weighing, most CEOs wouldnt bother with such mundane details.
This was epic
Love it
Guess what will go through the car door of the CT?  Water.  Given the issues with panel alignment something as unthreatening as water could be a real problem over time.
that burp in the end, priceless 05:51
Are the tires and windows bullet proof tho
Bro who is chewing gum christ its terrible
Luv it man science 👍
Personally, I used to like Elon, but dude your products suck big Donkey D!ck. He's very innovative, but the quality of his products ( excluding space x ) are just absolute junk.
Elon laughs likes he’s just threatened the entire tristate area
Will the new topic in the arrow world be g5 montecs? Is that what those were
Im doing life wrong - for context do it on your porsche joe
Wow!  Elon won one Dollar!  and a souvenir arrow!  Glad you two can sit down and B.S. and share it with the world!
JOE HASS LOST HIS SHIT
hte mexican cartels are gonna have a field day with these trucks
is this real? are we in simulation? that's what it looks like 🤣
A billionaire and an almost billionaire making a bet for $1 is hilarious!
😆
thats what i would do if i would be rich af.. smoke a doubie while someone with a stupid wig shoots my car with an arrow.. this is peak life ladys and gents.. doesn't get better than that.
A tommy gun is a gangsta gun from in the old ages and has way less power then machine guns these days.
You guys are amazing 😂 I just can't believe whatever they talk they do 😂❤
His hair is killin me
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Joe looks cute lol
I was worried about ricochet
bro....  have to shoot in the tesla and cybertruck for example
Bruh elon act and sounds like a robot.. something like a lab made person by the government 🤖
It makes sense the 45 penetrates less because speed is what defeats armor. Ke=mv^2 The velocity exponentially affects the kinetic energy. 9 mm is going faster around 40% faster than a 45 even though the 45 weighs twice as much it has less energy. You also have to keep in mind that the 9 mm is 36 caliber which means it’s smaller so that energy is concentrated on a much smaller area as well.  Here’s the thing arrows and handgun rounds are one thing, but what about rifles where we are actually talking about high velocity rounds designed to penetrate?
Papa joe and Papa Elon having fun😂😂
Elon Cameron Swayze ad for the arrow package ...?
No one wants one.
Great content!
Wow I thought that arrow was going through.
Elon smokes that cigar awful jointishly
Karen Rogan angry at Cybertruck for being toxic masculinity
Joe Rogan The only place where Elon relaxes enough to not act like a robot sent from the future
Joe's costume is legendary 😂
I love how excited Elon got when Joe mentioned the idea so much so he was like I’ll bet you😂 he wanted it done just as much as Joe did😂😂
Imagine selling a truck claiming its the equivalent to a 2500 series work truck, for double the money, then when you load a 12000 pound trailer on, the range becomes 60 miles.       Good to see it stops an arrow though.
hey cutie 😂😂😂😂😂
I fucking love Elon
TRT catching up with ol Joey here. Lookin REAL rough
Joe is wearing a wig fo sure
3:03 Durrr notice me Elon, i don't smoke, but I chew gummm, hey look look. F tf right off  Who is the f'n genius chewing like a cow trying to be a sweetazz?   We've all seen that person, for some reason they think gum makes em look cool and extra confident.  I'm fairly positive Jamie isn't that dumb and he's prob terrified to fk up working with Joe.   Whoever it is needs to be fired asap. Send em over to killtony and be a slacker yesman with redban
elon is just cringy as fuck.
Biggest bet ever!
This bow makes Joe looks very small. How tall is he?
1:22 Joe just so naturally brushes his hair behind his ear as if he wasn’t some bald ass 😂
I have a feeling Joe has had his neurolink installed already.
The idiot chewing gum recording.... C'mon man. Be mindful
that was awesome
This is so great on soooooooo many levels.
Old mate aggressively chewing gum while filming. 😅
Elon needs to go back home.....
😂😅😂Elon is holding a cigar like I expected he'd hold a cigar😂😂
Ugly ass truck. 😅
Joe Rogan's face is turning into the THING (Marvel comics)
I like the costume
Elon just lets him fire a crossbow at his car, I don't know if that's rich guy or poor guy shit
imagen the arrwos jumps from the car and hits someone
Fire your camera man, I could do better with my iPhone.
I’ll be honest. That was pretty dangerous, glad no one got hit by the ricochet😅
wtf he is wearing this wig?
That’s just badassery
insurance company:  Can you explain what you were doing when he shot the arrow at you? Elon: Smoking a Cigar and having a drink.
I love the truck on paper when reading the specs, but its just so damn ugly, you literally couldn't design an uglier truck.. I really don't get the thought behind it..
He-Man!
Joe looks like the original He-Man action figure.
Still an ugly truck design
You can buff that out
Did joe lose a bet? Whats with the karen cut lol
These will sell well in Mexico
you look like Jimmy Saville................not a good look.
Thats where HE-MAN went
Joe looks 70 in this clip, tf happened to his face?
you put a dent in his door omg This guy has OCD im sure he not happy with that dent lol
"I'll bet you a dollar"
I’m surprised Elon didn’t quickly calculate the ft lbs of energy at impact.. I could be doing this wrong but the bow at 520 grains traveling 300ft per second would create around 118 ft lbs of kinetic energy while the .45 out of the rifle length Thompson barrel might be generating 800-1000 ft lbs of energy at impact. That arrow had no chance lol
Tell whoever’s on the camera to take the fucking gum outta their mouth
After watching.  Elon Musk is the Baddest man on the Planet 😂
Why women live longer than men:))
If Elon wants to sell these he should make it more like an El Camino. America wants and needs Ute's like the Aussies have but we only have the full size truck option. No one is hitting that market here. And also..make it a hybrid.  Rear gas, front electric, like a lot of supercars are now. And also, have it spanking Chevies and Rams and Fords. Back in the day the truck commercials were amazing. Now they're as lame as humanly possible. Holy crap, has anyone sat through a modern Silverado commercial lately? You'll lose testosterone just by watching it.
From their first podcast to this  We can see growth in their friendship Joe is the greatest podcaster
Puerto Rico !!!
Ordered mine!
Dude, I can't understand what they're saying cause I can't stop concentrating on Joe's hair.
Yo Joe!  I have an idea, since "migrants" get their benefits over an app on the internet I think we ALL should sign up!  The Latino in front of me at Walmart last week left with 6 packs of steaks and a 3LB chicken and just handed the cashier a coupon.  We ALL need to do that!  Call it the 3 lb chicken.
Lol wtf is joe wearing 😂 that wig needs to be the new norm.
Joe > Elon
Hold my beer level: jolon
So this is what rich people do..
I would like Elon to be ask questions like what is his plan for charging cars by blocks of flats and people that park on side of roads without drive way.
4:07  "Well, now we know!  And knowing is half the battle." G.I. Joe
My truck is made of aluminum and wouldn't stop a chicken beak pecking at it. Very light truck. Slightly heavier than a beer can.
Was this recorded on a potato?
JOE 😂ROGAN THE NEW CEO OF BUD LIGHT 😂 LOSER
GTA 6 better be taking notes...
Field tip way better than any broadhead for penetration of @rmor
What are the windows made of?
"Hey cutie" had me rolling😂😂
Did that arrow tip fly past Jamie?
Global warming net zero is a scam.... enough already.....
God, this show is awesome.
Wtf did i walk in on joe
Jamie pull up the video where the arrow head almost pierced your guts
Remember kids speed defeats armor
“Hey cutie 4:02”
You two are cool. Having fun👍
🇵🇷🇵🇷 🇵🇷
He is wearing the Team Rubio shhirt in front of Elon 🫠🫶🏻🫶🏻
elon out there foolin the masses lol
RECESS!  Needs to be a prez candidate platform. Since in reality we're honestly all just big kids who want to go play.
Cool they went on a field trip😂
Native Americans hate this car because of this one simple trick .
What is Joe dressed up as?
They really are not kidding about Elon having two armed security guards at all times. You can see the one wearing a red Medical Trauma Kit.
Wig is so on point. Gotta love it 😂
4:06 that laugh is absolutely nuts !
I wasn't ready to see Joe like that hahahahahaha
Try a longbow
Just what we need. Future criminals with an armored vehicle capable of eluding caputre in 3 seconds.
well joe just found his vehicle for the apocalypse
Im disappointed joe took his wig off for the shot
That was great
Wtf is he wearing
this only wouldive been better if jamie wasnt eating during the arrow part lol crunch crunch crunch
This man is awesome. Making the best future for humanity.
Awesome A-Team reference Elon! Yaaasssss!
Joe rogan should play HE-MAN live action
How do i get my deposit back for cybertruck? I don't want it anymore
I clicked this assuming it was a spoof video...  then I saw it was the official channel lol
2:58 "It's sick"...
@slomoguys
Just 2 rich knobs who stroke each others “egos” over and over and over and over ….
Can't wait to see pingtrip work his magic on this one
That wig makes Joe look so much older.  The face features are just popping out
these are some fun humans.
GOD! that GUM SMACKING!!!!!!!
By the power of Grayskull ! IIIIIII HAVE THE POWERRRRRR.
BREAKING NEWS: HOST OF POPULAR ONLINE PODCAST JOE ROGAN NOW OWES BILLIONAIRE ELON MUSK $1 AFTER LOSING BET INVOLVING  80LB BOW AND CYBERTRUCK.
Elon looks like a classic movie evil genius super villain
Joe I like you but you're getting blunt stop asking the same questions
Next, Ngannou punches it. Seriously, that's impressive. I mean that's a big flat steel target, point blank.
Joe is siding with Dana over Budlight and its showing. 😮
Who would've predicted that having a bulletproof car might actually be practically useful.
`Well now we know’ 😂
No one is talking about the wig. Are we supposed to pretend we didn't see it?
Italian He-Man
Portfolio Managers Key Man risk Analysts cringing at ricochet arrows w/ Elon nearby
5:53 but it does on the cybertuck
New police vehicle
God, i can see the uneven door gaps from here. Also fun that the one dent from an arrow means the whole panel has to be replaced.
Joe rocking a Clemente jersey?
boys fun ...pretty cool
So nobody gonna talk about how damn dangerous that was holy hell
Joe and Elon are like 2 teenage boys smoking and drinking and daring each other. My truck is bulletproof...I bet I can shoot an exploding arrow through it! Show me.🤣
Nice. Now i know that i can drive my Cybertruck without the concern of having vikings, indians or the Robin Hood gang shooting arrows at me.
Elon will go down in history with a rare few the likes of Benjamin Franklin.  I'm glad to be alive to watch it all unfold.
😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🫡
What's the horrible sound in the bg? sounds like someone eating some candy  ew
If you’re going to have a ding in your side door it may as well have been made by Joe Rogan with a bow and arrow!
This was tip top male entertainment. I loved it.
Elon betting him a dollar has got to be the funniest thing I've heard all week.
A crossbow bolt and a compound bow arrow is essentially the same, that's funny cause they are literally they same just a Compound bow is bigger so the pull weight is lower.
This is an epic clip. So much fun so cool
Probably a quarter inch of stainless steel.
I want to buy a Cybertruck so I can commute safely around Houston Texas
Mad ugly car
Elon is right. The worst place to hide behind in a gunfight is the car door.  Better place is the engine area.
Marshawn Lynch
A real free speech advocate/MMA practitioner sitting across an FBI shill who undermines free speech on his platform
why does a truck need to do sub 3.0 seconds 0-60.  Idiocy.
Joe has  created a great environment for Elon to just relax while still discussing the things that matter .I think Elon needed this ,it has been hectic with the restructuring of 'X'
😂😂😃
I'm still unsure if Elon is a magnate or magnet.
Why is Joe Rogan dressed like Jimmy Savile?
Nice podcast even though Elon a control opposition 😂
Probably should of had some more safety in place for that but I well 😄
Ok but why Joe slaying that wig
Ok so I need a cyber truck now
Dude, this is marketing!!!!!!
You can tell this wasn't a gimmick, that metal to metal contact of the arrow sparked big time!
I just can't understand why some people don't like Joe. Actually I do it's because they've never really watched/listened to his podcast.
Is that jamie smacking gum in the clip wehre they shoot the arrow. Rookie mistake jamie. Rookie mistake.
Elons Tesla claims are with 2 foot roll-ins. Mat at Carwow exposed all of Teslas fake 60 and quarter mile times. End of.
Why do cops hide behind car doors then dealing with armed suspects? There are tons of videos online of POV badge-cams showing officers hiding behind car doors. It’s just a false sense of security from movies?
Every inner-city gangster is calling Tesla to place an order tomorrow.
joe rogan got the he man wig on lol insert he man meme here lol
whats with the wig is he trans?
Elon knows the apocalypse is coming he’s putting armored trucks in the hands of everyday people
How do you repair the dent?
WTF just happened! A tiny dent though not as bad as diabolical flop the launch
The Cybertruck will be a great vehicle for vips going through mega city combat zones!
Think/say what you want about Elon Musk but how many CEOs would accept, even encourage something like this? We hear all the time about celebrities who want to know what questions will be asked in an interview and they want to see the whole thing before it's published, to make sure that nothing negative will come out of it. They want *control* ! I'm pretty sure that Elon Musk had a good idea about what an arrow would do to the truck but still, talking about _control_ he clearly improvised here. Kudos to him!
He put the wig back on upside down 4:04  😂
Jimmy savile wig and cigar 😂
Jamie chewing gum drove me mad. Lmao
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen.
Elon is one of my favorite guests Joe has on the podcast.
hes trying to turn these into the usa police suv's. Hes gonna make billions off police departments
Holy hell who's eating like a cow during the whole broadhead test Jesus Christ
As an engineer iam not impressed tbh. Arrow, using rogans information about grain and speed etc, had only 114ish Joule of energy. A bullet has 400-800 Joule (normal pistol according to Google). I doubt it will withstand a bullet, if the arrow already did that much tend.
Bro love this stuff. Elon and Joe are so cool
This discussion fits perfectly to those two massive blunts they are smoking 😂
That " well now we know" well Joe is adjusting his wig was just amazing. Great clip!
Good marketing for police cruisers
Who the hell is smacking their gum right into the microphone as Joe is being recording shooting the arrow?
Joe looks like he man and Paddy Pimblett had a baby
That is one tough, hideous truck!
As a firefighter, how tf am i supposed to cut people out of that when they crash it? lol
Oh Joe you look like Jimmy Savell for fuck sake
"You know what I just realized, I do have some broadheads."  😂  To live that guy's life. Do you think he was ever on the set of News Radio playing a meathead and was like "One of these days I'm going to smoke with the richest men on the planet, talk shit and shoot stuff."?
Im 99.9999% sure elon got alittle mad at the dent 😂😂😂
Rogan is dog the bounty hunter for Halloween
Fuck yes
They’ll never dent your rental again   Hell of a garage
The criminal would love the CT...
The 2 coolest Billionaires in the world
If it's so hard, what happens when you crash and it doesn't crumple?
Try a bodkin tip next time...broadhead isn't designed for piercing metal
Jim saville
Hello cutie 🤣
👍🇺🇸
Bro i thought this was ai
Awesome!
Damn. Joe thought he was bout to make a mil for a second
2 cool dudes respecting each other.  Elon did you get your $1 off Joe? 😎
LET FUCKING GO BABY
Dude I can't WAAAAIT!
Pretty sure Joe owes him a dollar.
Joe is the wrong guy for the job. It takes a Jörg Sprave. LET ME SHOW YOU ITS FEATURES, HA HA HA.
who is eating behind the mic man get the f out of my ear.
This episode seems like feaver dream 😂
That was ballsy..no safety glasses no shield. Wow pretty impressive
Autist and the Twink
SF is like hamsterdam in real life. It use to just be in the TL’s. But now it’s ALL Downtown. Bustin knocks broad day.
I think the marketing of the Cybertruck as "bulletproof" is a setup for Cybertruck owners getting shot at by disel-spewing idiots.
Is he fucking eating some pizza rolls or something while we watch him shoot the arrow lol
Marshawn, get yo money, breh.
Cyber truck. Delivered on Time. Always on Time (production supposed to start late 2021)
Joe should bring Donald trump next
Elon and Joe, smokin' cigars and shootin' arrows at trucks. Now, those are manly men 🤪
Bro if I pulled up in that, I would 100% view myself as leader of the free world. I hope Elon does actually lol. It doesn’t even look real, dude made a cyberpunk humvee lol
Motors not engines. Nobody gets it right.
The sound of Jamie chewing gum in the arrow shooting clip...............
Hell Yeahhhh.... Joe with the PR jersey.
1:40 😅😂
Jamie loudly chewing gum on the background 😅
Joe talking with that blonde wig on as if it's perfectly normal.😄
I feel bad for the the car that collides with this thing lol, gonna look like one of them crash dummy commercials where they slam into a concrete wall
Tommy gun is a .45 cal
Why do I get the feeling that Elon didn't have to shop for that costume. Just pulled it out of the closet.
Now I want one
Just 2 gentlemen having a good time
🤣💯🤣💯🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🎃🎃🎃🎃
Joe goes from acting normal to feeling like Neil degrease after doing an experiment
Joe's costume omg
This was freaking awesome. Also really liking the cybertruck
My Toyota Tundra was over 7k lbs. And will last exponentially longer than any other truck out there. It's hard to beat the reliability of any Toyota vehicle
Why is he wearing a Puerto Rico baseball jersey and a wig? Did he lose a bet?
Cool seeing these two interact.  Not quite what I thought they would have done--but I guess it works.  I wonder if an AtlAtl would have been more effective?
Super ugly truck tho lets be honest
Two fucks walk into a bar...I give up.
"jamie pull that video up where Lex attacks the batmobile with a bow"
Detroit police force will order a thousand
The only part of the car you could hide behind is the block.
Nothing better than a genius stoned billionaire
How can they both be so smart and dumb at the same time?
But why is he dressed like this 😂
now that i see joe in the wig there’s no way that actually wasn’t him at the baseball game 👀
Imagine your on joes show.   Just wanna trigger the you’re grammar freak outs. Please let me know how smart Yous tinks ya are. Lol
They should have called up slomo guys or mythbusters before they shot it!
When was the last time a blonde tried to shoot an arrow at your car?😂
"Beware of Ricochets" 3:37 Elon is from the future & knew exactly where to stand.
I know a former Puerto Rican when I see it 🤣
80lbs on the bow and Joe like a beast pulls it back like its not there....
That truck is ugly!!!!! LOL
Just men doing men things 🤣🤣🤣
Joe seem different somehow.
That laugh when the arrow didnt go through is the new evil genius laugh
Joe looks terrifying.
daaamn there's a sick frame at 3:36 with like 100 sparks
....I know he's trying to look like an old school baseball player.... but I can't help but picture him as Prince Adam from He-Man.  Or a much skinnier Bruce Vilanch.
I remember how insecure and nervous Elon was at the first podcast he did with Joe. Its so awesome to see how comfortable he got!
Elon need come more I love his tests :D
Wepa Joe!!🇵🇷🇵🇷
"trucks are suppose to be tuff"  trucks are suppose to be a lot of things that the cyber truck aint.
"Trucks are supposed to be tough. Is your truck bullet proof?" LMAO
Looks like Joe is Transitioning into a gorgeous Blonde!
He-Man looking good!
That is one of my favourite moments all time. What an even to witness second hand!
Why does Joe look immaculate in that hair
Man I just love Elon Musk!
Why Joe got a wig on? Took me by surprise
Try a tungsten tip
Hey cutie hahaha 😂😂
I didn’t know Heman had a podcast
That'll buff out.
he bet him a dollar lol
This whole conversation and setting is almost like it was thought up by a feverdream ai. And i love it.
That hair. This is the funniest thing Joe has ever done.
Therapist : "blonde joe rogan doesnt exist!"   Me : "😶"
The richest man on the planet offered to bet joe rogan a dollar, that just goes to show bets are fun even without the reward
Is Joe supposed to be Flash Gordon?
The best advertising yet.
Red Hot Chili Rogan
This is probably the greatest clip ever from any podcast
Finally a truck I can drive trough the hood
ok, wtf is with the wig? What did I miss?
Eddie Bravo: ‘Let’s all wear wigs, it’ll be cool!’ Joe: ‘No!, that’s stupid’  Joe one week later…
I bet what I got in my closet will penetrate lol
how about a cross bow using a stack of leaf springs from a Caterpillar D9 bull dozer.
Was I the only one worried that was gonna bounce right back?
Thats some cyberpunk 2077 shit
What is Joe dressed as?
Elon cant even produce these things and is fucking up the finished models.
Isn’t energy per unit area pressure?
Cybertruck 1  : Arrow 0   WOW!  Go ahead and buff that right out!
Why is Joe dressed like the new Dylan?
'...open up man it's Dave! - Who? Dave!....Daves not here!'
Elon now owes Joe a dollar!🤣
Joe rogan wearing a Puerto rican jersey i know he was Puerto Rican😂🇵🇷puneta
So badass lol
Imagine what they would do if they were drunk casually having a conversation at 2 in the morning
Literally got like a minute in before I realized it wasn't one of those AI splicing videos.
Stupid truck that will kill pedestrians given it's shape and performance. Go to Mars dude.
Hey cutie
Wow. That's super impressive
Richest man on the planet out here makin 1 dollar bets lmao BIG MONEY
He’s just recreating Movie concepts at this point 😂
Why is he wearing a f****** wig
No eye protection or nothing, just damn 🫣🫣
Nice to see Rogan dress up as Leo Ashline lol. Shoutout to Austin’s industrial music scene.
JRE shoots an arrow into Elons car. Probably will cost thousands to fix the scratch’s. but all that is chump change for him.
um ,,,
is your truck bulletproof? lol
I need context to the wig
They're hiding behind the A or B pillars. The doors happen to be where those are..
joe know a loooot about alot of things...but he doesnt know the properties of stainless-steel??
Richest man in world and look at him doesn't give a fuck just so chilled
The spark. 😂😂😂
Love the cheerleader costume Joey 🤣🤣
Feel bad for any unlucky SOB to Tbone a cyber truck
Dude this has to be the coolest thing to happen in the history of podcasts lmao
thats the same hair as kurt cobain from nirvana https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6SHkQMFVlc&list=PLE5v0XrNmeS6todbeORW3nNnXuLXm5W_-
Nice listening to what a millionaire and a billionaire talk about!
Here before this clip blows up...
If a 9mm moving like 1300 ft per second won't penetrate why would an arrow doing 300? Idk just to see i guess
why is joe puffing a cigar and wearing a wig? he looks just like Jimmy Savie WTF
boy out here looking like a crusty naughty butler straight outta the 1800s
Elon came with the gentleman's bet. I bet you 1$ you can't 😂😂😂
Badass truck
One thing Elon said is not true. I saw a 45 bullet be stopped by a car door it was stuck coming up through the window button
This was coooollllllll
Electric vehicles are a joke currently, guys delusional
Elon is the true badass here, with all the money on the line, he don't give any F's! Sure, shoot the thing! I mean, people are going to buy the crap out of that car regardless! And considering how sht other trucks are getting, Cyber is a major upgrade in quality.
When Elon says something has a "beast mode", ya i want it.
These guys must be cool to hang out with
Awesome
A Team....hahaha..I'm with you!!
Just sold that truck
Bro that i such a baaaad idea LOL
I wonder if the Sinaloa cartel already ordered a fleet
you should have used a bodkin broadhead
That is just so nuts 😳
Dude doesn't know his A-Team.  They had an early episode showing them retro-fitting their van to reinforce the doors so they would be bulletproof, they weren't just running around in a normal stock van.
Elon is a PR guy and doesn't "run" or create anything
This is fuckin badass bro 😎
The costume🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I LOVE THIS!
Lol.. hey cutie!
Elon secretly trying to arm citizens with bullet proof tanks that can go 0 to 60 in less than 3 seconds.  And I’m all for it
"Hey cutie"
Hopefully joe brought up some cobalt conversation 😂
This is advertising at its finest. How much joe got paid
are we all gonna ignore joe's wig
That arrow would pierce a Nissan Micra, Joe the toe Rogan is a shill just a smoke ass blown shill what a 😺
Why the heck is joe acting like a trans person? They musta paid him big money to put on that wig
How high is Joe Rogan haha
Is it just me, or does this video radiate PINGTR1P vibes? 😮
Elon is just a king.
“The Chicago Edition”
Lol 300 fps 😂😂😂😂💀. Yo a rocket scientist just told you projectiles moving out a tommy gun at 1100+ fps would not penetrate. Jo… “I have a crossbow” 😭
90lb dammmmmmmmn
Elon is awesome for exposing the media, FBI, and CIA election interference in 2020. Although widely ignored.
Smoking with these 2 would be an actual ride.
Cybertruck delayed for another year while Tesla solves the arrow problem.
Joe is so dumb about the crossbow
why Joe dressed like that?
Boys after a few drinks lmfao
WOOOW...those white neanderthal people learned from the egyptian skyscraper pyramid geometry loving ethiopian dark burnt face blacks for hundred + years....... then they became the greek.....then they became a roman ..then they are building planes and rockets in dubai and russia and america and ukraine and iran and iraq and israel and hamas.  History yes.
Yep, i fking loved this! Cant wait for the day Joe interviews Putin, its gonna be a blast.
lol NOW WE KNOW.
This comment section needs a girlfriend
Prrreeetty dumb not to wear eye protection, just saying.
I guess I want one
cartels are gonna love this trucks if its available in mexico fr lol
Joe: "Why did you make the cybertruck bulletproof?" Elon: "So I can fully enjoy watching The A-Team"
Was just thinking of OW hanzos scatter shot , like joe is about to kill everyone in that fucking room
😀
To beat armour you need speed, not kinetic energy necessarily
So, are we really not gonna talk about Joe wearing a wig?
One of the richest man betting a dollar… smart
I love that Elon is just like "fuck it, we can go do it right now if you want."
Now that is some quality entertainment!
I want one of them trucks!
This, ladies and gentlemen, is why we have the internet
Protect this man at all cost.
Love the chills with Elon..
Which one of these 2 are the bigger l0ser?
Every since rogan got the rona, he lower his content.
Elon hit the nail on the head, which Joe failed to realize when he was saying a bow would perform better than a crossbow in the going through the truck. Velocity beats armor, not weight, it's why they were using crossbows and longbows against plated armor, it had higher velocities and increased penetration.
That's entertainment.
That's what rich people do for fun
No eye protection is crazy
Joe sitting there looking like He-Man lol
Joe's costume must be ronda rousey
Doing all this while dressed up as his look-alike 😂😂😂😂
Two cool men!
so Joe is showing Elon is the man and he is ready to receive Elon as if he was the women
Now, if a bullet will not go through, WtF makes yall think an arrow or a crossbow bolt would? 🤨🤣
Every policeman's dream.
elon betting a dollar on it is the funniest part
why bother putting out pumped up stats for a car when you hide all the good stuff behind a software paywall? no way in hell does that truck do 0-60 in under 3 directly off the lot. you have to be a "special" person or pay out the a for it. he makes everyone else who buys it kick rocks. plus everyone knows you end up paying vastly more in repairs and if the battery is ever damaged, you have to buy a whole new car. get outta here with this half baked tech. the lithium batteries alone are unsustainable. dude made the car equivalent of ear pods, expecting us all to be cool with throw away vehicles. nah, i'm good.
LOFKNL joes preformed a classic that is hilarious
This was the best clip ever. These dudes know how to have fun.
This started out exactly like a Pingtrip video
Why's Joe looking like he-man 😂😂
Why do you have a dent in the car babe?  Joe Rogan shot a arrow at it 😅
Brilliant minds !!!
Elon:  you want to shoot my truck with your bow? Every dude watching:  FUCK YEAH!
I'd say these claims are going to get someone killed. But I still doubt it'll reach production.
"I used to be an adventurer like you. Then I took an arrow in the Tesla..."
2:40 hey Elon Musk 10 mm is way more powerful than a 45 just to correct you there sir I carry one so I know
Loving the costume 😂
That was impressive
These guys are so frickn great 😂👍😱🎃
a car door is concealment, not cover, Cover is an engine block.
He said I’ll bet you a dollar 😂😂
there is a reason why the military /  criminals use bullets not arrows....
Lol wtf
Imogen chillin w Elon  Or even Joe 😂
That was impressive
When is this dude going to pump doge? I need to sell mine
Make Elon sit in there 😂
Elon creates things you didn't know you needed but then wonder why someone hasn't thought of it before.  If the exterior doesn't allow bullets or arrows to penetrate, just imagine how protected you would be in an accident. Talk about saving lives. Cheers 🥂
Can you imagine Joe driving around in a Cybertruck. How much advertising would that be?
I don’t get the wig
What's with the wig, did Joe lose a bet?
90 lb draw is 10lb past ridiculous.  Rhinoceros weight.
Joe! Why would you ruin the finish of a beautiful Tesla truck?
Well. That was rich people type of insanity.
I'd like to see a super slo mo of the arrow hitting.  Get the slo mo guys on it :)
Why the blonde hair😂😂😂
Use an umarex air saber
incredibly dangerous.
I don’t appreciate Elon ruining all the movies that show people using a car as a shield.
Whoever was recording that arrow shot sounded like they were chewing gum like a douche bag 😂
😂🤣Rogan new hairdew
I really interested in hear what they are saying, but Blonde Joe Rogan is so distractive 😂😂😂
Elon was genuinely excited to have Joe shoot an arrow at his car and I love it.
Now that’s what I call content
Try the window next time joe 👍💯
Who's going to pay for the door repair?
What about the glass
Ok, I'm starting to warm up to the Cybertruck now.
Left a Dent!
Bucket list item #4: Dressed like a schoolgirl, smoking a cigar with the richest guy in the world. 📝
This just furthers my theory . Elon is building vehicles for mars. Evs are not the utopian be all end all here on earth ,thats proven more and more month by month. Probably a lot easier to have a test ground to try it all out. Heavy for its size and not really useful as truck here Also bulletproof but a planet with no atmosphere has particles that are traveling bullet speed .. Idk . Seems like a useless thing here on earth. Seems shaped and designed around another purpose.
I’m sold.
ironically - Joe is pretty slick for doing this
Whoever was filming the arrow part sounded like they had a mouthful of peanut butter
Is this He-Man’s new podcast? "I am Adam. Prince of Eternia...”
is Jow Rick Flare?
That would be a pretty awesome commercial let me tell ya.
Is Joe dressed as team rubio?😂
What is with the blonde wig
Joe looking fabulous, like he about to flip his hair and sassily wave his red manicured hand in your face MHMMMMMMM
I'm more impressed that the truck didn't even get a pin hole in it.  With a fast compound bow.
HOW CAN YOU NOT LOVE ELON!?? 😂😂😂😂 Elon + Joe is the wombo combo
Elons just making sure he can drive to his rocketship with no interruptions by poor people when the planet goes to Hell.
And the stock begins to rally again, thanks! 😅
Certified Native American Resistant
Congrats to Joe for looking exactly like Jimmy Saville.
Hahahah props to elon and to joe.
I love that two of my fave humans tend to hang out together
So Elon drives that truck around? It’s a prototype. So that truck has a very tough exterior, it got dented from the arrowhead but still remained tough. The truck can repel gun bullets too? That’s insane yo, I want to know how much it will cost, probably like 125,000$ USD. But what happened to the roadster? 0-60mph in 1.9 seconds, that’s crazy yo
Is he meant to be Jimmy Saville ?
Field points would work better, you need fast and hard to penetrate armor. 150lb crossbow with hardened steel tip probably would have done it. .
I was here to look at the beautiful lady in thumbnail
Elons preparing for WW3
Joe likes wearing that wig. Shane was right, Joe is getting real close.
I hope Elon keeps coming back to the Show! WE MUST PROTECT THIS SUPER NERD AT ALL COSTS!! GREAT SHOW JOE! ❤
i would like to see that dent repaired now....
Joe rogan coming in like He-Man
Thats Joes garage at the studio? My mans gotta throw some paint on that wall and get some decor going, he loves his cars, that garage should be a sanctuary where he can park up and admire his metal!
Joe, Elon said Cybertruck was engineered not designed to be bad ass.  I am a 67 YO divorced BM, I was sold on the Cybertruck being my retirement home when Elon said the stainless steel would be bulletproof to a hand gun. I even ordered 2 for my kids.
Building an ugly truck and it sells out simply because of a popular name. 🤣
Getting lit with Elon and shooting arrows at a cybertruck, doesn't get any better than that 😅
Wtf is the wig all about
From this view, it looks like it dented it. But impressive!
The wig😂
Where can I download Musk’s laugh? I need it for my spooky halloween decoration
Please don't give the camera again to the guy chewing gum 🤮
Marshall Lynch owns Beast Mode TM btw
They're talking all serious and professional then, "There are three demonstrations. One of them people are aware of is emptying a Tommy gun into the side of a car..."
Problem is, anyone buying this ugly truck, will get people trying to destroy it? Rocks thrown at windows, now arrows at the bodywork. Doesn't make much sense, build it, and they will try to destroy it😂
that bow was shooting more than 300fps. joe rogan can you test the fps of that bow you used i use nothing but matthews bows all my life and almost all of them shoot over 300 plus im shooting 320's with my bow today and its over 10 years old ( creed xs )
Ask him about his battery plants where he's importing the cells for them from.
love the idea but hes going to have to solve how do u escape if your trapped in your own car during an accident fire or plunged into a lake or caught in a river
-Elon ( yeah sick)!!
what about the windows?
This gives me motivation to get to an even a baby version of these guys.  Fun!
"Should we send someone to go get it" lmfao These guys need a show
4:57  Joe; ''...why did you build it?'' (paraphrasing) Elon; ''Trucks are supposed to be tough, right, so, is your truck bullet proof?''
I don't know why but "I'll bet you a dollar." coming from a billionaire made me laugh pretty hard. 😂
I bet you your dog 😂😂
Joe looks like Anton Shakur from the movie no country for old men with hair from a woman on hahaha
Cybertruck is the stupidest looking POS in the world.
What?  No baseball bat to the windows to show its bullet proof?
fantastic !! this is great video, nice one Joe and Elon.
Police departments must be salivating over a potential police interceptor cybertruck...
Joe lookin old as shit👏🏼👏🏼‼️‼️🤣🤣
What was the shotgun shooting? Buckshot? Birdshot? Slug?
Bonnie and Clyde would survive today in the cyber truck
So clearly Joe you have gone with the LGBQ gang along with Dana.
elon for presidnt
But there are some car doors that will significantly change the speed and direction of a bullet possibly saving a life
Careful, Elon...Biden and his brown shirts will come after you for BETTING a dollar! They're just looking for any excuses to give you hard time since you disagree with them.
Elon is the coolest!
Who in the hell let some doofus chew gum while holding the camera as they cut to the warehouse part?!?! Geebus man! That was painful.
so badass that it went down like that, "yeah lets do it right now"
Jaime with the open mouth chewing 😂
@4:05 - "well now we know" I cackled.
Love the cameraman chewing very loudly. Gross.   Cybertruck is another Musk disaster. LOL
JR channels Jimmy Saville?
Not sure if joe was going for the jimmy Saville look but he pulled it off perfectly 🤣
Elon is such a loser so much cringe
masters of the universe much
Eddie Bravo gonna be pissed Joes wearing a wig without him!
If like to see that truck shrug off a hit from a 12 gauge slug, I don't buy it...
That gum chewing tho.
Gonna stand back, smoke a cigar, drink my drink, as a dude shoots an arrow through my high tech truck. Life's guud!
These AI generated shows are getting scary
That was awesome! Pretty ballsy on Joe to shoot it from that close.  I'd get worried about shrapnel or the arrow coming back or the broad head grenading. No glasses or nothing! Ballsy for sure.
I wonder, is the glass bullet proof and what about tires/wheels being bullet proof?  No point if someone can shoot your tires out and you’re stuck.    Also there are reasons he’s doing this.  To show other countries and military/leo’s they can use these for support missions.  He wants dat government money!
Gov. DeSantis of Florida needs to buy the entire police force cyber trucks.... that would be some judge Dred shyt
This sums up American society completely godless souless moraless
I love Elon an Joe together
Joe looks like he's going to ask for the manager
flash gordon Joe rogan is the strongest joe rogan.
FU Money!
The richest man in the US says I'll bet you a dollar. Smh
Rogan is the only man on earth to buy a cyber truck and immediately feel the urge to fire an arrow at it. Lmfao.
Wtf Joe is wearing on his head?
Wow fun to see joe get out of the studio and do some content. I'm impressed. That arrow put quite the dent into the door though. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's bulletproof, maybe more like bullet resistant depending on the gauge.
Holy shit the guy holding the camera, we don't wanna hear every fucking movement from your mouth chewing gum.
He just sold that to every rapper who wants to talk shit with no repercussions 😂
Joe 😂😅😅😅
Elon's cars look like alien pods that came out of The Jetsons.. Elon is mainly a troll..
Cybertruck is cool but that bow is crazy
He's not talking about a hunting bolt there Joe...
Jamie chewing gum 👎
$8k+ worth of damage
That was awesome 👌!!!😅
Lmao musk was like go head shot my truck with your arrow 😂 dude 😎
The wig with no context makes this video!
Joe Rogan is Iggy Pop with more creatine.  Change my mind.
HE-MAN!
This is the kind of "wealthy person" fun I'd definitely enjoy!!
One of the best podcasts EVER!
Actually so dangerous
What's with the Jimmy Saville outfit
THE MUNCHING GYAT
Loosing a bet to elon about physics.  On my bucket list for sure!
WTF is going in? Then I remembered its Halloween.
Dude that might be one of the coolest things I’ve ever seen. The amount of confidence both people and what they were doing and then having to freaking testicles to try it out is incredible. Great job
Let’s try a gun
Legends 100 percent 😂❤❤❤
Im a fan of the car now
So your truck will look like a dented can after a while lol
is it He-Man? "I have the POWER!!!!!"
He-Man aged a lot.
Every time Elon said something it is always an interessant fact
That trucks looks pretty good here.
just say trucks are different than cars
Seeing Joe in a blonde wig feels so wrong.......and yet feels so right!
THIS IS BEUTYFULL
Joe Rogan looking like he walked straight out of Castle Grayskull in this one
So I'm safe in Sherwood Forest...excellent 😂
I want one
Elon totally ignores the arrow goes STRAIGHT to the dent 😢
Dunno about everyone else but I don't feel like guns shooting at my car is a huge concern.
That truck is now worth a shiny penny for that dent
😭👌
Jamie, you should put a strong compressor/limiter on your master channel for the mic bus to automatically/dynamically change the volume of the voices if they move back from the mic and drops the volume as they get close to mic. Keeping the output level relatively the same.
The Cybertruck will be the official vehicle of gangster rap
New getaway car unlocked lol 🤣
7-8K lbs? That's two 2500HD Chevrolets in just that truck... damn
Haha love joe,s Karen look and Great video with Elon
A added plus?... (with the refection, you can see yourself doing it.
Shares are a buy on Wednesday!!!!
Jesus...i hate how elon musk talks. Sounds like hes choking everytime he opens his mouth.
🤣🤣
"Hey cutie"
Joe Rogan, can you do your spinning back kick at the Cyber truck and see if you can dent it?
Give one to whistlindiesel
These dudes are having the time of their life. I remember my uncle bet my ex-brother-n-law that he could get his old Bronco through a hole where he was going to add a septic tank. They were drinking, that Bronco did not clear the hole.
Is joe supposed to be looking like jimmy saville
Joe needs to star in a He-Man reboot
"Hey cutie"😂😂😂😂
What about a ballista on a cyber truck
Chewbacca on the camera
So funny this is so entertaining joe
Go on with your bad self Elon.
Why is he not in his office? Its immoral for him to not be at the office
Would have saved Tupac
Elon looking like a gigachad timelord and joe looking like a companion
I'm really looking forward to this episode.  Two amazing guys, and being an archer, i know how strong that truck is.  Also, i hope Joe necer finds out who Jimmy Saville was! 😳
So glad these two are around, legendary stuff
Jimmy Saville talking to Elon!
whats up with hes costume lol
i think joe is sold.
Prince Adam interviews Elon Musk!
I thought this was ai created
Fun Fact: Soft Barriers like Sandbags and Water that stop bullets are actually way better defeated by bows.
I’m so high. Is Joe wearing a blonde wig?
I fuckin love rich people
ELON PART 3 LESGOOOOO!!!
4:44 elon just hoping hes not going to begin about the price of the arrow LOL
Joe looks like a hobbit next to that truck
Had to get out and bolster fan base, he lost 40 billion in two weeks. Gotta pump
They are weird, man...
EV is a scam what a piece of junk
Joe has hair now respect on the transplant joe
insanely dangerous with no face gear or protection, very very stupid
Only Rogan...
Only Hancock can hide behind a car door.  Love that scene.
Question for any bowhunters/archers out there - would the arrow rebounding of the car not be a concern for people in that space? Just wondering
WOW
Joe looks like Thundar the barbarian
of ocurse asking why he chills with isreal killing baby president is to "big" to ask, what a coward joe became
BEST JRE CLIP OF ALL TIME? it is for me lol
Whoever is chewing gum while recording them shooting the arrow is an imbecile
How cool was that….!!!!!!!
Was the camera guy chewing gum obnoxiously loud with the camera right at his mouth or what.
I had a dream that joe rogan was wearing a blonde wig drinking and smoking with Elon Musk...and suddenly decided to shoot elons truck with a bow and arrow....  Even when i was in college drinking and taking mushrooms I couldnt come up with this shit...  Kudos Joe for taking me back to freshman year of college
Bullet proof but it will be dust in the north in 10 yrs
Best thing ive seen all day 😂
Elon is such a scrotum
Joe is still riding elons meat
That is one of the most baller billionaire moments ever, Elon Musk smoking a cigar and drinking whiskey while Joe Rogan shoots an arrow at his truck.
Elon dont know how to properly hold a cigar! 🤣🤣😅
I want a that truck but with a Duramax
I hope they make a Cybervan.
With that wig on Joe looks like Sarah Ashton-Cirillo the American troon Ukrainian  war reporter.
205 feet a second , joe knows everything hahahahahaah
One reason, and one reason only this "truck" hasnt hade it to market.  No matter how fast you make it, no matter how many bullets it stops, no matter how shiny it is. It is still a pickup truck run on the worlds largest cell phone battery, and it cant tow worth dick.   The Ford lightning has been a flop for one major reason. It'll get you 250-300 miles on a charge, until you want to tow a trailer. And then, good luck getting it to go 80 miles on a charge.   Rich people like take half their life with them, when they go camping, or on vacation. Loaded up in an electric truck, they're barely making it out of the county they live in.   If the Cyber truck was officially launched, it woukd be a laughing stock and utter failure at being what it's supposed to be. A damn pick up truck lol.   The highest rated electric truck on the market by far, has been the Rivian, and that company just went belly up.  Until the tech that powers electric vehicles advances, electric trucks will nevel truly be viable.
Are there many south afrikans who sound like elon? Most ive met sound a lot different or maybe its cause hes been in the u.s a long time?
Joe lookin fineeeeee haha
"Ill bet you a dollar" Killed me!
Elon must make KITT a reality. That totally looks like knight rider.
Put your money where your mouth is…..
i would have bet 1000 dollars that arrow was going to go in there
Just 2 billionaires enjoying life😂😂
Joe Rogan looks like Jimmy Saville with that wig on!!!
This is insane! 😅
Doh! If a bullet wont penetrate the armor what makes you think an arrow would?
Joe looks  like a divorce wife after 6 months of marriage.
Wasn't he bald?
What a lad
That door panel is worth $10,000.
“I’ll bet you a dollar”. That’s a man who knows he’s right and doesn’t need to bet a billion dollars to prove it.
whomever has the camera needs to CHILL with the gum chewing directly into the mic.
V8 swapped Cybertruck
"I'll bet you a dollar" - World's richest man
Nice interview!❤
Gum chewing is not the ASMR I'm here for
I guess that's just how you laugh, when you have hundreds of Bills in net worth.
OMG how cool is that..... that Elons laugh - pingtrip has got some material
2 of the coolest guys on the planet
Wait, if its that hard, can it still crush in case of collision?
Good commercial boys. Still not impressed
❤️🔥🙌👏👏👏💪 that was fucking Awesome!! HA!!
Science 👍
Watching elon and joe smokin cigars and drinkin whyskey... you start realize  its a mans mans world
The Chewing Gum noice of the camera man is horrible but the video is fun. 🙂
i love JRE!
Love Joe getting out of the chair!!!
Joe looks like He-Man🤣🤣
What’s Joe’s Costume ? 😂
This is what makes life so interesting. Two people that have grown up in two vastly different parts of the world having a discussion while smoking a cigar and then shooting an arrow at an incredible truck. Proud Owner of a Ford F350. Damn,I love the United States and our trucks.
We are not worthy of this content
LOVE TO SE IT!
The camera man's very loud and gross gum chewing sound...unprofessional 👎😆
A must have if you live in Detroit or Chicago.
Would have been great if whoever filmed Joe shooting the truck would stop chewing their gum…….
Lol this is freakin awesome! You guys rock!
was that a spark?
This is stupid AF!...and tremendous all at the same time!  Joe rocking Flash gear and Elon repping?  I knowits Halloween, but still 😂
This is for the people that don't like Elon... YOU SUCK. He's awesome.
F250 weighs 10k
Did Joe actually dress like that guy LOL
I love how Joe is just rocking a Puerto Rican baseball team disguise bro!
bro that car looks like a car from a 1999 video game
Who fuckin care!? You still need to be a millionaire to fuckin own one this is stupid.😂
Is this real or AI? Why Rogan wearing an ugly ass wig? Has he been sponsored by Bud Light also??
"Barely scratched it" I see a big gaping dent but ok dude lmao
We need a milspec cybertruck that can be up armoured
Elon is the BEST,, JRE is Awesome, what a combo.
Joe you're making it impossible to watch other youtube channels now.
Did the car let out an energy shock?
who chews gum that loud? It's disgusting
“Beware of ricochet”😂😂 That was cool!!
Okay i am convinced men dont grow up!  Our toys just get bigger!
Camera guy chewing gum, loudly. Way to go dumbass.
So now we know the Cybertruck is officially ready for the Walking Dead Apocalypse 🧟‍♂️
😅😂
This feels AI generated. The concept, the visuals, it's like an AI from 50 years into de future made it.
"You can make a heavy crossbow bolt." 😂
as an archer,  i really liked this video... except the camera man almost got hit by something there xD
Why elon make so much noise.. dude is drinkn water and is still cant hydrate. Has to be a reptilian
Elon i do like you but if you dont reinstate my twitter ,you are gonna get an email :D
*"Jamie, Pull up that clip where I bow hunt that eccentric billionaires prototype automobile"*
Why is he dressed like that
40 minutes since this was poster lol I thought I was gonna be  1st to leave message 😂 or at least in first 10 omg 1K++ already got in b4 me😢

Joe looks like a retired glam rockstar
@teamrubio 💪
This is such a rich thing to do.
Bald Rogan... Or Blonde Rogan... 🤔
Use a rocket launcher and then a garbage truck.  Beast mode. Lol. I wouldn’t be caught dead in this dork truck.
What a shit vehicle 😂
I dont want to judge Joe, but why is he wearing a wig?
he built this thing with the A team in mind, beautiful
That “hey cutie” by Elon after Joe losing that bet meant something 😂
With that amount of take off and force, tyre bills and the roads are gonna get hammered, gonna need new roads sooner with these electric cars.
Joe trying to sound smart in front of Elon is so endearing
Your camera man during the arrow shoot chews their gum like a 14 year old high school girl.
You guys were way too chill. What was in those cigars? 🙃
That seemed line a really dumb thing to do.
I'm convinced Elon Musk is not the one running the show.  He is the eccentric face of Tesla and Space X. I just don't get the impression that his knowledge of engineering is as comprehensive as people believe.
Rogan, Musk for President please.
"men get Philosophical bout Dumb Shit"  rip Patrice O'Neil
Can someone tell me who joe is supposed to be dressed as please?
What else is there to say? A couple of GOATS!
2mm mild steel is already pretty much arrow proof.
Ok, this discussion spoke to me. Two men, talking about firing bows and crossbows at a Tesla truck. It's the kind of nonsense we usually talk about. 😅
joe mccarthy steve mccarthy hogwarts bill nyes tom mccarthy was right.
I bet those are 100 dollar Cuban cigars...😅😂
The guy smacking his gum when they were in the garage was killing me
Elon is the coolest man alive no lie
FFS Joe you look like Jimmy Savile lol
This makes me hTe my life. I hate it so much
Anyone else hear Elon's laugh at 4:05? Dude is a robot I'm pretty sure...
CyberTruck is  Light Armoured Personel Carrier
Elon is literally one of the coolest people on earth I love how he does what he wants when he wants
joe looks like he-man with that wig.
Why dose he have a wig on lmao
Best guest award.
Men are just awesome!
Joe in a costume and his public disguise at the same time
Whoever was holding the camera in the garage and chewing or sucking on some kind of food needs to be fired
There should definitely be more of these irl podcast scenes
Doppelganger joe is so funny.
revenge for what has been done is, which is  never going to be forgotten. eat somewhere else nightmare.
2 of my favorite people I've never met.
Holy fuck that's bad ass
Your arrows suck, Joe
Elon Musk eats babies
Elon laughs in billionaire
Yea because all the drive by bow an arrowing going on this will surely crack down on that lol.
Wait, why the wig?? And wait, shoot crossbow to a cyber truck? Yeah why not 😂😂😂😂😂
"I'll bet you a dollar" lol classic
Joe The Paddy the Baddy Rogan!
Being bulletproof is a selling feature that EVERY six figure earner in the WORLD will consider.
When a wealthy man bets $1 he’s confident.
Elon trying to tell Joe about bows and arrows is just a funny thing like dude Joe probably knows what he's talking about giving he's shooting regularly
He-man made an comeback with Tony Stark
Elon wants to destroy democracy. He wants a one party system.
Commercial commercial..they can't get enough of them self. Strange that people don't see the stupidity in this. Rich extreme right wing capitalists getting together to sell their crap to people. Propaganda. And that Truck, this is just so fake and staged
Broadheads are no good against steal, gonna want a spike tip, perhaps one with a tungsten tip.
Bliksem Joe, what happened to your hair broer??😅
This is straight guy stuff.lmao He was close to it too.
I swear Joe Rogan is cute as shi
Elon musk: real life isnt like the movies..so what i did was make the movies like real life
you should invite someone with strong character like Mr. Joe pesci 😂
it's like a medieval plate armor
Poor Joe. Hears it can handle a 45acp and then thinks his arrow will go in. 🤣
Try a real heavy bow with a hardened tip and it just may go in
Buy Silver & Platinum.
That’s not a truck. It’s an suv
Close your mouth when you chew
2:32 Eh, .40 is actually about 10.2mm. It's why the .40 S&W is called the "10mm, short and weak." The 10mm is actually more powerful than the .45 ACP despite the smaller diameter.  He's not wrong, he's just not precise.
Awesome truck. Finally, some serious competition for the RAM 1500😅
jamie I know you were not chewing your damn gum like that in the warehouse LMAO couldnt hear over your chewing lol
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
cybertruck changing the course of the auto
I love the wig. It ties everything together.
women. take a gander, this is a classic conversation between guys out. can i shoot your car with an compound bow? i bet you dont make a dent. let me bring the car here... or we talking about the universe or poop... depends... :D
Whipping arrows at your pals truck and laughing it off.  Bromance like none other!
You should have used a target tip. The broadhead just got destroyed and absorbed a lot of the impact.
Whoever knows about archery, What would that arrow done to a man?
That was awesome!
Truck may be tough but it’s UGLY as hell.
Wow, best Tesla Ad
Tesla does not advertise, but Elon just got at least 10 million dollars worth of Cybertruck publicity thanks to JRE. Very smart guy.
Hahahahaha they actually shot the bow LETS FUCKING GO JOE XD
A true meeting of minds
How are we supposed to look at Joe and take any of this seriously 😆😆😆
Joe is so tiny his bow looks huge.
No weed today, just cigar? 😂
Joe Rogan is the most Joe Rogan to ever Joe Rogan.
elon's laugh is so evil it needs to be in cartoons guy is a legend
what happened to the wig? you lose a bet? 😂
Elon: truck are suppose to be tough right? is your truck bullet proof? Hmmm...
Try an annihilator broadhead. Might work???
Lmao elon trying to sell cybertrucks 😂😢
Miss rogen now 😂
Jre format got switched up so much in one episode
👍🏼Elon/Tesla needed something positive like this airtime
I was scared for a minute because this is the only way I see Joe Rogan dying
Joe a transwoman for halloween?
Elon seems like such a chill dude, not sure why the media hates him so much.
And these 2 wonder why the aliens are not visiting
This fucking guy joe lives the best fucking life of anyone alive RN. He just shot an arrow at the richest man on earths unreleased truck and then put on a wig 😂
Needs more bodkin point ;)
Elon casually dropping I’ll bet you a dollar 😂
Best JRE clip ever.
Is this Joes humiliation ceremony?? 👱‍♀️
The man said "like the A-team", this is why he's the "man".
3:27  -Bye Joe...
What Elon didn't tell Joe, elons personal truck is 3" reinforced tungsten steel 50cal proof version that comes with rockets you control with neurolink
That gum chewing sounds like a damn Camel
That's a $10K dent.
I have a 50 pound bow and it could go through a windscreen or car door. Just a guess. Sounds like a gun shot when it hits something. Joes draw weight is absolutely nuts. He’s a strong mofo.
Cartels new vehicles
we need a transit cyber truck A Team style
He-man
I love how Elon puts his money where his mouth is,  literally with everything he does or is involved in.  The man is single handedly and drastically changing our world for the better imo. I'm looking forward to seeing what his next big project is.
God I love this
He owes you a dollar
Holy shit, Joe looks like Rip Torn in drag.
Beautyfull hair joe,it look's really cool 😜 hardcore "peacocking" 🤭 let me know if the ladies dig it or not 😁
"If you shoot a gun..", I can almost hear Joe thinking, "so can we try that on your truck"😂.
Who needs crash tests when you've got Joe Rogan and a bow??😂
Elon is so cool and so chill, would love to work for that guy.
Those cartel convoys are getting scarier
Imagine being stupid enough to not realize eye protection is a must have in this situation. Or imagine thinking you're above it, impervious or maybe just too cool.
Elon + Joe = Broham! Frikkin love it!
Joe saying he has some broad heads while he has the head of a broad.
I’m glad Elon doesn’t own blizzard yet he woulda caught a stray hanzo arrow to the dome
Elon Musk badass... WTF ... He just is a genuine person. This type of shit is why PPL trust him. You can't make this shit up... 😂😂😂
I think the only parts of a regular vehicle that will stop bullets are the engine block and wheels.🎉
Because we should all be worried about getting hit by an arrow in 2023
stupidest looking vehicle ever. never going to sell
Is anyone now worried about CyberTruck's being like tanks running cars over when they are in car crashes?
This would be a good thing for law enforcement.
@JoeRogan @JRE  When are you going to interview Ashton Forbes? #MH370x
use a 125 swacker
The sheet metal on my 1999 Chevy Blazer is paper thin and it's only gotten thinner since then.  It's super difficult to weld it is so thin.  That arrow would probably go clean through both sides of my Blazer.
Miliatary Grants coming up i guess.
What are we doing as a species?
Joe you shouldn't bet him ten because he's x and x equals ten
Imagine getting trucked by a cybertruck while youre cruising in a lil hatchback
but now it's dented. can the dent be pushed out?
boy.. He-Man sure hasn't aged well
Joe Rogan: “Tell me about the engine and its specs.”  Dipshit supreme: “IT’S MADE OF METAL!”
I'd love to have what Elon is drinking. He looks really buzzed.
I love when people do what they are want as long as it hurts no one else. I love when these two get together
At the start I thought Elon was blazing up ..too much time spent with jhonny Hopkins and sloan Kettering I thought🤔
Sounded like whoever was filming (Jamie) was eating at the same time.
Elon holds a cigar like bugs bunny
0-60 is <3, but if you do that more than once or twice, then the range is 10 miles.
I know what I'm spending 3 hours on tonight! woohoo
hahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahaa
What the fuck is rogan dressed as? He man?
If Joe had died shooting an arrow at a Cybertruck. It would’ve been the most Joe Rogan way to die in all of history.
that thing gonna get dinged up n scratched good...
When da fuq is it coming out? Other than that it’s bullshit
Joe my crossbow arrows are 520 grains
I'm still not buying it.
Why does he seem to think that anyone would take an EV in the apocalypse?  I barely even want to own one now unless I have ny second gasoline car as a backup.  Plus if it brakes, youre screwed. Gas car is an easy fix.  Would never use an EV for that purpose. Its stupid.
Bulletproof , perfect for LA , the war in the south is slowly crossing the border .
Joe owe Elon a dollar
Brought to you by chewing sounds.
That is the ugliest truck ever made.This for people that dont know anything about trucks.
Next experiment: How many arrows does it take to take down a Tesla Truck...
Elon lost weight fair play
Being rich enough to let someone dent your expensive as hell vehicle dang.
Cybertruck is going to be very dangerous
This is crazy, this guys are just talking and then decide to do something crazy and just do it. LOL!!!
That’s not Joe Rogan that’s JOE MAMA
doesnt cars crumble to keep you safe in a crash?
Rogan skips leg day
You cant call joe unfunny when he is wearing that costume
Yes, i want my truck exactly like that. 👍
Still manage to make Joe look big, give Jamie a raise. Masterful work or angles
Best thing I've seen all 2023.... You can't get better marketing for your truck than this.
Does anyone else hate "twitter Elon" but can tolerate "interview Elon"?
Nerd kid lets cool kid break his shit so cool kid will hang out with nerd kid , classic .
The guntuber community will have a field day of the cyber truck.  "This week we gonna shoot the cybertruck with a .50BMG"
The Wig ...lmao
elon, your wrong. 9mm penitrates furthur than a 45.
So just spot two of them in LA and sup with the body looking like is dent up at certain angles. I believe has something to do with having a flat surface in the body.
Joe needs insulation for his brain like this more regularly.  Elon and Joe are US National Treasures.
No one gonna talk about how the value of the car has gone up tremendously since its joe himself that darted the art?
Now we know that the cartels or anyone associated with crime will be ordering these trucks by the truck loads.
Elon kind of weighing in on the Heavy Arrow conversation for a minute there. Heavy FOC for the win.
Is Joe a trans for Halloween?
Who the fornication is molesting that gum😢😢
Who is smacking GD gum?!?!
Terminated.
Camerman going crazy on that gum 😂
So, a guy has to choose between a truck where the bullets go through it like butter and a truck that is bullet-proof. Which one does he want?
This is what America is! Awesomeness Gentlemen…loved it!
Joe likes to throw it back for his billy buddies.
Christina P has let herself go
oh i cant wait to listen to this!!
Elon is one of the coolest dudes in the world, so it appears.
Baldness Everelk
Elon saying "Hey cutie" to Joe is absolutely hilarious !
The Beast Mode version will only be there so he won't get fined
That lil dent, I'd be pissed
Elon is the dumbest billionaire the earth has ever seen
I was today years old when I learned that hiding behind a car door during a shootout only works in the movies 🤦‍♂️
Joe Rogan must be getting initialized in the illuminati
Not sure whether Joe looks like He-Man or Jimmy Saville ? 🤔
WHITE MALE ENERGY
😂 that’s hilarious
Now show us doing it to your daily driver Joe!!!
I think B.A. reenforced his panels.
That chewing noise behind the camera though. What in the world.
I can't believe it didn't penetrate. I have shot broad heads through 1 1/2" bullet proof lucite glass used in banks. Gun didn't go through. Arrow , straight through.
Elon Musk = = Marketing Genius = = But what else ? !
Looks like tommorow is gonna be another good time to buy tesla stock from the inevitable dip that this podcast appearance is gonna cause.
RIP Owen Hart
Joe scary AF.
Ummmm… why is he wearing that wig??? 😂
The GH making Rogan look like a sasquatsh. 😂
EVERYBODY want ONE
Men will watch this and be like " hell yeah"
THIS WAS AWESOMEEEEEEE
😂 he put the wig back on backwards 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣I can’t stop laughing
I imagine Elon Musk had to demand he not shoot the windows.
I really want to see the cybertruck in all black, or even any other solid color.  I bet it looks really cool black.
oy vey Joe with the wig
Bruh wtf Joe Rogan doing talking to the richest man in the world dressed like that lol
@whistlindiesel
ok i'm impressed
Geezus the camera man chewing gum is 🤮 nice shot and impressive for cybertruck. But now shoot a reg car.
That truck is so fucking ugly tho.
All those  native america tribes roaming the plains now absolutely deflated as to how they are going to deal with the posses roaming after the Bison in their Tesla trucks.
Noiceeee, can’t wait to watch it errr listen to d podcast while driving to and from work 👍🏽
Ugliest vehicle known to man 😂
This is exactly what I’d expect to happen when Joe talks to Elon.
Did Elon buy Joe some hair plugs or what? Definitely not as good as his.
I don't know why but I love the fact that Elon is still smoking the cigar while watching Joe shoot arrows at his truck haha
My man CHOMPIN on that gum
man!... that was cool! And that car looks like its CGI in real life. damn cool!
Now every "Gangsta" wants one, (me too).
This is what happens when you leave Joe and Elon unsupervised  😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆
What the he'll is Joe wearing haha
Imagine being this cool with the WORLD'S RICHEST person to the point where u get to shoot arrows to his own car. man these guys are absolute legends. Probably the most bad ass video on the internet rn
Is the camera man chomping on gum??
THC Vanessa make it cool
Is it me, or is uncle Elon looking 10 years older in lets say 2 years?
joe......small and fast is how you defeat armor.....
Crossbows are made to penetrate armor Joe 😅
Joe actually dressed like the meme they made of him? That's hilarious!!!!
Ooh i like her.
he built it with military in mind
lol nobody is going to buy this stupid truck.  Elon tied a noose around his own company with this thing.
guys guys! i mean guys! y am i impressed
I still want one
Jimmy dore had sex with a girl before he was married and and Greenwald is a traitor to Brazil and uncle Joe is destroyed America and Jimmy dore helped sink west campaign and pushed JFK jr taking voters away from trump
the real question is is it really him in the baseball game??
Elon is the hero we dident deserve, but got. That man is amazing  !!
Imagine being Russians puppet like Elon. Is Potato 🥔 🤣🤣🤣
Why did joe think an arrow would pierce it if a shot gun wouldn’t?
Is Joe Sarah Ashton Crillo?
I love how he's so willing to try and obliterate his car window, that he's willing to send someone to get get Joe's bow to test his theory😂
"The car is bullet proof." "Can I test it?" "No just trust me" What a joke.
Joe needs to work for Elon and advertising and promotion
Awesome video!  Camera guy should spit out his gum though.
4:03 hey cutie LMAO
Why does Joe look oddly like He-man?
More!
Ai is crazy
this thing probably does more damage than the kill dozer
That is it. Joe Rogan is He-Man. Tell me I'm not the only one who sees that.
Must be making these cars for gangsta's to be bullet proof !!!
When the fuck did Joe grow his hair out? I like it, kinda He Man ish.
Why was the cameraman chewing gum, wth?
welp looks like SWAT can place the orders now
Can't get more stereotypical white then this lol.
HOLY shit 15,7 Mio. Abos oO WTF !!!
I suspect that these cyber trucks will be extremely popular in Chicago 🤔
So many people hate on this guy , I like him more each time I see him .  Dont think he really cares about you haters
When did He-Man take over!?
price?  98,990.
A millionaire shoots a billionaires truck and breaks his arrow.
“Built Tesla Tough” 😂
It wasn’t a clickbait 😂
Right, this is Halloween and I'm English. Is Elon being Vincent Price and Joe is being Nancy Pelosi? Is this like a nightmare on wall street joke?
Momentum is what matters. Mv^2 the mass doesn't matter as much as velocity.
Is this a deep fake?
You know youve truly made it when you can wear a silly wick and get permission to shoot an arrow into a billionaires space car from the future.
🎉Elon for the win!!🎉
FUCKEN COOL...
And I say hey, what's going on
Is he meant to be Paddy Pimblett?
What the duck is his hair up to today 🤣
Ok
So we should be seeing the Mexican Cartel driving these soon
Bro who is chewing gum right into the mic?
I always underestimated crossbows and never really understood why they were considered a proper legit upgrade of a bow. Then I found a youtube channel demonstrating how the heaviest 'ancient' crossbows that required a rucksack harness to carry could break two trees with one shot. After that they demonstrated the modern equivalent made of compound materials, practically rifle size doing comparable damage to the ancient one.  Now I've almost managed to convince myself the only advantage actual rifles has is ammo capacity and fire rate. Crossbows are proper weapons I realized, and it was a wake up call.
Everyone should watch this, literally all of the people.
How can you not love Elon 😂 bro is the genius of our generation and yet more in touch with everyday people than all politicians
the sides is fine but what about the windows
god the camera man chewing gum is nasty AF
Whoever was chewing gum while filming this clip needs to chill 😂
i wish there wasnt as much chewing during the bow test but, otherwise, nice
Can't any better advertising than that lol
I just love Elon👍
Rich(Elon) famous(Rogan) doesn't matter, men still love to dumb stuff to answer dumb questions... And I love it.
Is this a newer episode? Did they chill out for halloween Today?
Fuckin hilarious stuff here
4:03 best part of this clip - gotta love Elon and Joe together!
Whats with the wig?
Who would have thought an arrow vs steel steel wins
Just A flesh Wound!
Elon is cool due to his billions,and should invest in saving the third world countries,Love you guys,take care.
The richest man in the world betting $1 is the reason why the rich stay rich.. It's not about having generational wealth its about being smart with your money!
how AWESOME!
Paddy pimblet outfit on point joe 👌
That was awesome
That broadhead out of that bow would easily punch holes in the outer skin of any car right now. That is super impressive.
Bro no cover? Nobody is worried about ricochet?
Like two regular dudes : the rich version.
right now.
Tesla buys their steel from Finland. They really do. Google "Outokumpu Tesla" (from Nokia 3310 land)
*EVs weigh 5X more than gas-powered vehicles, and they are mobile containers of toxic industrial waste.*
Kyle Antony Mee
so pay an extra 20000 just incase someone tries to shoot you with a bow and arrow lol they do seem like a horrible death trap those "trucks" and they look like shite imo
Joe’s ability to know so much with so many different guests, but still can struggle with a wig is hilarious😂😂😂😂
Hahhahahahaha I’ll bet you a dollar
so no one questions the wig?😂😂😂😂
I have an airgun you can test with!!   .50 cal :o
From the smartest man ever- "You may want to shoot at an angle"  Joe proceeds to shoot from straight on
Mate he is a fucking geezer 😂
Chicago need this asap😂
FFS Joe thinks Elon doesn't know that speed offers more energy than weight. God damn
All he had to do was not shit on dogecoin and I’d still like him
This car will be great for California 🤣.
elon musk is elon musk for halloween
Can you hide behind a older car
This is an iconic moment lol
But why does it look like a car model from a Playstation 1 racing game? Couldn't it look like a truck?
Shall we send someone to go get it? Said no poor person ever
How can u do a serious interview with that wig?😂😂😂😂😂
Just don't throw something at the "bulletproof" windows because it will shatter worse than Biden's hip!
Hate to bring it to you Elon, but I've seen police hide behind a car door during a shoot out. Now they dont get a lot of funding for training, so i dont blame them
Elon's laugh is amazing lmao
Can't use a 7000 pound truck at a job sight on a rainy day.
barely scratched it? you dented it, you knob...
WE NEED MORE!!
Does that include the windows? Maybe I'll buy a cybertruck so my windows stop getting busted out at the mall.
Lmao "yea itll be funny"
Why is  Joe Rogan  dressed like  Benny Hill??
trouble is they would follow you and just down the road when it runs out of leccy there just get you lolol
How loud was the fucker chewing gum during that arrow segment!? I bet he could penetrate the tesla with his jaw strength.
Planet X, Sumerian Gods
This is why we love Joe and Elon.  Grown ass men doing junior high school kid stuff because life.  No pretentions, no qualms only 'let's find out right now'.
A massively heavy truck that does a sub 3 second 0-60 being shot in it's solid steel doors by a heavy grain arrow fired from a 90lb bow with expectations of ricochets and multiple people with striking distance of shrapnel. Safety last in all regards with this one.
Speed is how you defeat armor. This is why pistol rounds are relatively easy to stop where a rifle is extremely difficult to stop.
At 3:36 when he shoots the arrow, a part of it breaks off and flies back towards where those two guys were standing. Could have been deadly. You can it at normal speed but if you slow the video down, it's clearer.
Man Joe can drive that truck while standing
Here before 10million views😎
Man, I was thinking cool ,but not wondering crash tests. Will the cyber truck be a death sentence to anyone unlucky enough to get in an accident against one?
Why is Joe Rogan dressed like He-Man?
Lol Musk loves this type of challenges and shit
Christian’s squirming when he said “beast mode” 😂
OMG!!! That thing looks like Robo Cop is going to step out of it.
This is what you’re supposed to do when you get rich.
FFS Thought Jimmy Savile was dead
This car will break the ice 😉 in the states that think EVs are only for latte drinking vegans !!
Let me guess... Joe once again fails to ask any questions like... Why do you call people pedophiles and then apologize when they sue you? Or why do you say every year FSD will work next year and it doesn't ...or how many monkeys did Neurolink kill.?...or why can't Starship make it into orbit?
Someone explain to joe that speed is what penetrates armor
Humiliation ritual
shoutout to the pig chewing the gum in the clip.
Joe looking 🔥
Where’s the $1 Joey
“Bet you a dollar”🤣🤣🤣
Elon having a serious convo with a blonde wig wearing Rogan is LEGENDARY😂😂😂
Love Joe but that truck looks like garbage, if u wanna get laughed at buy a cyber truck. I don't understand Tesla's are nice cars why they decide to make a prop from the 1970's, that truck could literally be in Back to the future and it would fit in perfectly.
my sad reality is, I'm shaped like Joe Rogan
Chewing gum while recording. Well done Jamie...
Joe looks like what Danny Duncan would be on massive amounts of steroids.
That's cool, for a moment there I was doubting but Joe always has a bow nearby 😂
Camera guy fails at closeups.
Hey Joe.  Looking for a professional camera operator?
Now THIS is Entertainment!
I love how Elon was so game for Joe to shoot an arrow at the cyber truck
Michael Fabricant MP (England, Conservative party) wants his hair back.
Immature.
Should have bet a painting of the other like Epstein had of bill Clinton. Elon could have a painting of joe in a dress at his entrance right now… missed opportunity
4:16 Joe looked like he was disgusted that the arrow didn't go in as he was mentioning how fast it goes 😂
damn elon's game on point "hey cutie"
Nice it through sparks!
Watching this on 0.25x speed is wild
Watching this felt so odd but cool
Just need a Toyota Petrol Hybrid power system in it and everyone would buy it
gotta love science
K now try a trebuchet!
Very cool
Thats impressive!  It bounced the broadhead arrow! I thought for sure it would go in like butter because the broadhead is a high carbon steel (unlike a bullet which is copper and lead).  I was expecting it to at least lodge in.  Nice!
why tf did the dent show up before the arrow made contact?
An f 250 weighs 5-7000 lbs you cyber truck weighs almost 10,000lbs. It is now where near the weight of a full size heavy duty truck lmao
Joe in that wig looks like the old HE-MAN head sculpt from Mattel. lol
I love how Joe has gone from wearing a shirt with Elon to wearing a blonde wig.
Cops need those doors for cover if in a firefight.
I wish my car had a dent story this cool
Elon has a relaxing voice. Imo.
Nine millimeter will not go through both doors.
rogan knows zero about everything ..not even bows and arrows
Is it true blondes have more fun?
Next guest that shows up in a traditional pickup truck Joe should ask THE question  🙂
The manliest place in the world and the fire detector chirps. Just like in every woman’s video.
Jamie, pull up that video of that bear shooting a cybertruck with a bow
"HEY JOE"
👀
Fucking LOVE that Elon knows guns, bows, crossbows and will argue with joe over bolts lol. He's just a cool mofo. I hate that he hides so much about boring company... Look up. Look up... But don't worry about what we are doing down here. Oh also, DON'T DO AI, I'LL KILL US... But please come on over and let me implant your brain with a chip!
We'll be safe in 1800.
I'm supposed to dont like Elon, but im too old for that shit. I cannot help loving someone that loves Deus Ex and creates such a car!!
Give me a break Elon..... It's because YOU can.
Surprisingly,  Joe pulled off that wig very well.   He definitely could of been a surfer ......
Elon looks ready for Masterpiece Theater.
just another tuesday for joe doing all types of crazy shit living life
Joe ALWAYS trust his flawed thinking.
I never realized how tiny Joe was. Is he like literally 5'3?
Bruh why’s bro cross drsssin tf🤣
The interview just opening up to Joe Rogan looking like Paddy Pimblet 💀💀💀💀
Bruh joe be looking like HE-MAN
Elon seems more comfortable speaking
The fact they're even discussing it is bonkers
Who is the cute blonde? 🫠
Joe is so small 😂
Cybertruck sales just doubled lol
this is the most guy thing ever lol
Elon is very lucky his name wasn't Chris Griffin
I'm just starting . Is there weed involved? looks like weed involved. I hope there's weed involved.
This is some serious gourmet shit
the range on this is gonna be laughable,i would say maximum 200 kilometers
Lol elon loved that it broke the arrow 😂
use a field point with a trocar tip next time
Never thought id see behind the scenes of the jre.
Its very subtle but Elon just gets shit done, "wanna shot it right now? Wanna have someone to your house to pick up the bow? We can do this right now" While most of us find excuses to not complete tasks, hes ready to get them started.
Wtf I was at work and everyone was saying Elon was there driving a cyber truck didn’t know he was taking it to Joe
Joe would make a great He-Man.
Neat.
bro said a joint was to small and came back with a big Cohiba stuffed with Zaza
03:02
Thank you Joe for covering up that head that glare was starting to give me a headache. 😂
Can someone tell the idiot recording in the garage not to chew gum while filming? Sounds like an effing cow.
sliding through the hood in a cybertruck on business! 😂
Joe looks perfect to represent the new UFC/Bud Light partnership.
"the boys" energy. just hanging out
Elon is so cool bro.
I honestly don’t understand stand why some people hate on Elon. He’s just an average Guy that just so happens to have a crazy IQ.
why is Jimmy Saville interviewing Elon Musk lol
The amount of spit from people gargling their balls in the comments like Elon doesn't hold a cigar and glass like he is afraid to get dirty.
All the cops are going to want it, and the military also. thats why. Oh and all the rich paranoid types that do not want to hang around when the unwashed get pissed enough.
I really appreciate both of these guys.  I can only assume the negative comments are rooted in jealousy.
How is this not an AI generated clip?
hey cutie!
I am here for the comments.
Great promo for the truck.
wtf is wrong with joe bruh....
bro that ricochet could have been dangerous :D
haha he said 'broad head' then brushed his goldi locks ever so gently. classic rogan!
An arrow couldn’t make it through stainless steel. Not surprised. I’m sure there’s gonna be all kinds of ballistic tests done to this thing.
⚠️What’s even crazier is doing all this without safety glasses⚠️
Elon’s laugh sounds like Vince Mcmahon 4:05 😂
Well, if there is one demographic that will buy these trucks I would imagine various police departments would be interested.
Any country that has the infrastructure for the tesla charges and stuff should definitely get a bunch of these cybertrucks for the police force. The truck seems awesome.
Ultimate bugg out vehicle if you tow a generator lol
That could’ve gone south very easily with the ricochet. Surprised he wasn’t at least wearing safety glasses.
Where’s the link to the full interview?
Is Joe was going for the Paddy The Baddy look 😅
I had to stare at the thumbnail for a good minute before realising that shit was real
Dont shoot it at the bulletproof glass!
He put his money where his mouth is....  I love the fact that they talked about it and the answer was:   "Right now".
Why is Joe dressed like Jimmy Saville? The cigar just finishes the look perfectly.
What a great conversation between two cool dudes, Happy Hallow’s Eve 🌙 👻 🎃
Extremely based. What a time to be alive
Joe Rogan uses Rogaine,  can't blame the trans game.
This is exactly the type of stuff i pictured rich people doing for fun.
Lol when Elon was on the podcast his first time Rogan dressed so formally.... We've come a long way lmao
My electric longboard sounds like a Tesla 😅😅
The entire point of a truck is hauling not going 0 to 60 under 4 seconds or being bullet proof...  Can it haul 16,000 LB's long distances and off road...?
I cant stop seeing he-man.
Elon taking precautions with the cup and the smoke 😂😂..
It's not going to stop a rifle.. But I still like the "tough truck" concept.. especially how it's not even painted and it's stainless steel.  I hope Ford is forced to make one too and we branch off into an entire "tough truck" industry where there's a race to build the most durable vehicle.   I love it
Elon is such a chill guy.  Love him
*The wig, Elon and arrow! This video is bizzairly perfect hahaha! Love it!*
Sketchy! 3:35 The broadhead came ricocheting backward at Elon lmao. Imagine Joe gets this man killed doing some stupid shit
Watch out for Fragmentation guys, you got me nervous.  ❤
Thats so cool, brought a smile to my face :)
Next time lets not have the camera man chewing gum into the mic.
Now do it with different bullet calibers and I’ll be impressed
Elon vs Mark MMA Who you got??
Two guys with massive audience casually advertising the next favourite truck for ram raids, street shootings and gang fights. An 4T armor plated truck is exactly what the world needed to curb the energy crisis. Genius 🤡
*Paused @ **3:22** to say WOW THIS IS EPIC here before 100M views* 🙋‍♂️
The gum chewing is ridiculous 😆
That noise is really annoying. Who the fu** was chewing gum whilst filming that?
Joes costume is hilarious. I love that he saw the meme and played with it
love this
Love the Pete rose Costume.
Merchandising to makeup very extended delivery times!!
Imagine losing Joe Rogan to a ricochet from trying to shoot a cyber truck with an arrow
canceled my cybertruck order 2 years ago. Very glad I did.
Joe looks like ex wrestler Ken Patera
Bet a dollar from the richest person on earth!  That’s a BOSS move!!
tf is this?
Elon smoking a cigar watching Joe fire an arrow at a Cybertruck halfway through a podcast is one of the funniest gangsta things I have seen.
Why is Joe wearing a Puerto Rican baseball outfit 😂
Wait so Elon's wearing costumes on JRE now😂😂😂😂
Elon should put out a Tesla Cybertruck Super Bowl commercial with a concrete release date
Okay but can the Cybertruck survive a tornado??? 🤔
TRUMP 2024 TO SAVE AMERICA. SLEEPY DEMENTIA JOE BIDEN CAN ROT IN HELL!
That chewing is why Jamie stays far from a mic..
Lol nice hair
Are the windows bullet proof as well ?
Was the camera man eating while filming the shot???!
That thing is so awesome. I told the wife I was getting one and she said no way thats parking in front of our house. I think it looks great though.
Chewing of the gum 🌝
Why is joe dressed like JIMMY SAVILLE?🙄🙄🙄😁
Is this the first ever out-of-studio podcast footage?
God bless rogan, this is such a rogan thing to do, a well executed side kick would definitely do the job😂
What‘s up Joe Rogan’s wig?😅
🏆 for best costume of ‘23! Way to embrace the meme Joe!
Peak novelty
Imagine a cyber truck hitting another car at 70 mph. That shits gonna kill everyone in the other car 😭
Caitlyn Rogan
Elon seems like he has entered into his villain arc.
Joe looking like Ellen on testosterone
Who tf be chewing gum like that? 3:10 Only wrong answers:
Any reason for the wig?
Joe looks like ric flare with that wig on.
Less talking more building my truck. Been waiting for a long time now.  You have my 100.00 bucks.  PLEEEEEEEASE!!!
44 billion valuation to 6.......this guy is an idiot.
If you hide behind the front wheel of a car (and assuming the engine is in the front) you would have reasonable safety from bullets, certainly not absolute. I think, however I wouldn’t care to try it out.
sick!
LMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAO JOE IS SMALLER THAN D FUKKIN CAR
Joe looks like he's about to call the cops on a black girl selling lemonade.
Elon is autistic.
Joe what you doin with the hair bro. Chill on the weed bro lol
lol wow …. Fun times
to this day i see movies where car doors are bullet proof and its so annoying... even a .22lr will go through both sides of 1 door unless it hits some heavier metal like a bolt or some part of the door handle or window mechanism.
This one is for the books
LOL.  He-man.
That’s bad-a$$ and super-cool
Elon to himself … silently… “you just ruined a $10,000 door to prove my point, Joe.”
How should have with the full He-Man costume.
This is amazing….
That wig is the ultimate Judo move😂
If it came in diesel I'd buy one
Bet you a dollar. That is a true friends bet. Love it.
is this a new one?  elon  has to know about all the alien stuff. neuralink + astral projection = time travel. continuing the research started 2000 years ago in peru.
1 dollar is code for 100 grand
Colombia podcast😂 Pls I'm I in the right Joe Rogan podcast. Joe hair 🧝 Elon 🤒
sorry to say this as i respect Rogan,,,,ask anyone from Britain who Rogans looks like in this video and they will say the British pervert Jimmy Saville complete with blonde hair and cigar just like Saville.....ffs
Why is Joe wearing a Puerto Rico baseball shirt ? Anyone ?
Wtf is it with the wig? 😂
I was able to measure that Joe is 6 times his head size in height, this is significantly lower than most human beings, who are at least 7 times their head or 8.
🥰🤣🤣
I absolutely love Elon Musk. He is truly bonkers.
I love it that Elon is ready to put his money where his mouth is.  "Joe, can you send somebody  home to get the bow? We can set up a demo tonight."   He's no BS straight up...
Elon and Joe best combination ever for a podcast
Joe Hogan obviously has no idea about bows or crossbows.
Blooming Heck! Seeing views go up LIVE! Now...... Which one of those fella's is an actor?? 🤔🤔
Safety goggles would have been a smart choice, but ya know. Whatever, lol. Impressive though.
Can you shoot an arrow into a normal truck?
OK, it's Spotify time cos TONS of shit has happened since he was last on!
Nice choice to chew gum while you're recording. Very edgy.
Joe thought cybertruck was a mechanic bear so he tried to hunt it
Joe looks like a angry Karen in that wig🤣🤣
Joe 100% thought the arrow was going in.
love these two
I like Joe with hair ☺
He -man
Joe trying to grasp the notion of momentum is so funny
This is def AI made right.
We have all been waiting far to long for this clip thanks Joe
The wig
I wonder how much Tesla stock just went up?
Dood. This is hilarious. 😂   Joe: Can I try it with an arrow? Elon: Yeahhhaha. It'll be funny.  Elon: Fuck yeah. Sick. 😂
"You can shoot it with 3 different types of guns and it won't penetrate it." "Can I shoot it with an arrow?" "...Sure!" 😂
4:14 he about slipped up and said that HE STUCK A DENT IN ELONS VEHICLE. I bet he felt a little bit sick, knowing he dented a billionaires vehicle, with a ARROW.
How can he keep a straight face with Joe wearing that wig?! Lmaooooo 💀
How much ya wanna bet the woke people will be crying on Twitter over these 2 talking🤣
I hope the chewing gum was nice!
what the hell is going on?
Elon just chillin with a cigar and a glass of whiskey. 😂😂
Deer gonna be driving Tesla trucks soon
It's wild when you realise the wealthy are on a whole other level. Broke person: "Oh, I left my hunting bow at home! oh well, that's a shame..." Wealthy person: "If you want to waste an expensive arrow on my cyberpunk car, we can send someone out to get it..."
Joe Rogans audition tape for a live-action Scooby Doo
somebody wrong for chewing that gum like that 😂
"I use to be a truck like you..till i took an arrow in the knee"
Joe probably cant ride any theme park rides
Elon really lives in the moment .
Joe sounded like a kid in a candy store lol “can I try it with a crossbow”
That’s fucking awesome
Joe the fan girl
It’s so interesting to listen to Elon Musk talk anything.
should have done a Ric Flair whooo after shooting that arrow.
By the Power of DMT!! I have the Power!!
i just seen the arrow peace fly back at the camera just barely missing it
When I first saw the smoke coming from Elons side I was like oh no here we go again then the stogie comes into view haha
I fuckin love these guys. They're just filthy rich dudes.
Eddie Bravo wins…  Joe is wearing a wig 😂😂😂
Yeah you need to hide behind the engine block.
"Well now we know" Joe was high as fuck and this was hilarious.
Stoned Joe.... Elon your car broke my arrow😂
Why is Joe wearing a wig
Joe's hair threw me off lmao. God I love this podcast
ATeam had steel plates in the van. We forgive you for being a genius and not knowing pop culture 😉
Nobody aint gonna talk about Joe Rogan's wig? Lol
Happy Halloween!
that wig love it. its like crazy bro’s together
okay i had to come too youtube the second this happened in the pod lmfao wild
Joe ! Loving the costume, I NEED EXPLANATIONS haha #teamrubio #puertorico
The most impressive....
So now we need to keep testing to see what it will take to penetrate.
Joe with the wig caught soo off guard. Dead. "Wow" lol
No matter how rich or poor guys are the same. In the trailer park this same thing happens lol
So boring
When I read the tag line I thought it was meant figuratively not literally!  Hate to say it but the govt will probably sue Tesla bc they are made too well and can't have citizens able to defend against an attack by one of their weaponized agencies. Of course the suit will not say that, but that is what the truth will be.
The Cybertruck is pure American.  Big, dumb and comes really fast.
That truck is 6000 POUNDS! After checking the weight of other EVs, I have discovered the problem with them. They outweigh gas cars and trucks ALL OF THEM.
this truck built better and not cheap plastic like the other vehicles
I can't believe the broadhead didn't even penetrate, that is a massive amount of force unto the smallest possible point of contact.  That thing is a tank.
So we can drive or cyber truck in the apocalypse, and be safe from Indians?!
Why is Joe dressed like Jimmy Saville?😅😅
About time Joe lol
556 and 57 are the most important Calibers to be protected by. Who's cares about pistol Caliber's
Bro, the gum chew in the ear
🇵🇷 wepa
Why is Joe wearing that wig? 😂😂😂😂😂
Joe still propping up a career liar young global leader haha
😂😂😂
He knew he fucked up when he said beast mode. Like shit I gave too much info already.
“Almost 3,500 thousand CHILDREN DIED in Gaza during three weeks of escalation, about 940 are missing - they are probably under the rubble.” - UN
The shit Elon allows people to do to his stuff is fascinating.  Maybe in the end it is another data point for him.
Watch them release a cybertruck wrap "joe's arrowhead" with the Mark of an Arrow & a cartoony looking Joe trying to get the tip out 😂😂😂
Shooting a sharp broadhead at that thing indoors was the dumbest thing Ive seen Joe do...Jesus. With the "richest" technologist of our time standing next to it😂.
I’d love to see Joe interview a normal guy that raises a family and clocks in and out everyday. I feel like the conversation would be interesting as hell.
So is the cyber truck out yet ? What’s the deal
Joe you should have tried that with a field trip
Lmao joe 😂
elon looks tired or fucked up
Props to the gum chewing simulation.
What’s the payload, pin weight, range while towing, all the important truck questions. If it can’t do jack hauling. It’s worthless as a truck.
thought the thumbnail was generated by ai
Maybe have someone film thats NOT smacking their chewing gum with their mouth open.....my ears are bleeding
In medieval times crossbows were the only things effective against heavy plate armor arrows wouldn't work
Awesome
i love this
He-man
Would someone tell Elon Musk that the angle on the back of his truck is so stupid looking. The front is cool, but that angle on the back just kills it.
To hell with the design it’s ugly so be it, but the practicality of safety and being a truck person, it’s fantastic.  The only downfall is no load capacity and/or bed.
Hey cutie AHAHAHAHA
Jamie chewing on the camera
wtf is this wig XD
That’s a major life moment for both guys I bet 😂. Sweet
Hey cutie..
How have more respect for bows now God damn
Cyber Truck is going to be the neighbourhood Drive-By-Shooters and Gangbangers whip of choice from now on. Sorry about your declining Charger sales Dodge. Bruthas need armor.
who the FUCK was smacking on gum behind the camera
👍👍👍👍👍👍
I love how stupid the start of the full podcast was. Elon telling joe the cybertruck is completely bulletproof, except the glass but its optional to get bulletproof glass.  Bro, its physically impossible your stainless is bulletproof.  You may stop some 22lr rounds, but so could most vehicles.  Being stainless, maybe you could stop a glancing 9mm.  Bulls**t you are stopping any large calibre handguns or any rifle calibre whatsoever. Thats why they tested it with pissy little rounds, probably with just led ammo, not jacketed so he doesnt make a twat of himself like last time with the whole windows fiasco. Guarantee if you shoot a bolt action, or even just an AR or AK into the door of that truck, youre going to have a sore kidney and/or liver.
Sounds like the Cyber Truck is going to be incredible. That is If you are worried about gangsters shooting at you or you are a teenage boy. Otherwise it is going to be an expensive, heavy and impractical toy for rich tech nerds. Btw the sub 3 second 0 to 60 time will never happen. That’s just Elon spraying his musk.
These two on a podcast together is magic I love it. I hope we get a toon out of this.
Any details on crash test survivable?
DAMN THIS WILL BE THE NEW COP SUV!
Gangs and cartels will love this car 😶
he should tried it on f150 too
left a decent dent . barely scratched it xD
Lol that evil laugh every time
Muzzy broadheadd?
Still talking about this truck as if it's 10 years away
joe looks like he rdy to shoot the Sandlot sequel xD
Goddamn that thing is ugly
if Joe says gauk, gauk, gauk. it would nice
Bro this is why i love Elon this is something me and my brother would do on a Friday at the shop after a few Js
<3
How amazing can your life get when you have the richest cool guy with a smoke and a glass of whiskey watching you literally using a crossbow on a highly anticipated car which still isn't launched
I like that Joe is finally embracing his lord Farquaad body type!
damn, joe looks a lot like he man with that wig on
whoever was recording while Joe shooting the arrow needs to chill with the gum chewing lmao
Rich people shit
I love it when you have Elon on the podcast!
no way....thats tough
OMG Ai is out of control. This seems so real...
3:29  Joe rogan is a genuine dwarf
elon musk has more money than he has brain cells
3:33
Damn Joe is tiny😂
Joe Rogan is preparing the bear 🐻 test and the monkey 🐒 test too.
That’s some crazy 💩, out with a comp bow
No way lmao
Incredible!
I love the interaction these guys have.  One of Joe’s gifts is his ability to make people comfortable thus open up. And I don’t think I’ve seen Elon more comfortable in an interview or conversation.
How can you not like the JRE? It's great - with room to grow. Let's go!
Elon in the truck dressed as a vampire, hot blonde girl shooting arrows at him.
Elon has gotten so much better at speaking since the first time he was on Rogans podcast
Should’ve signed the dent
I saw one cybertruck here in Cabos !
That's He-Man right there ladies and gentlemen!
Joe finally has a warm head 😂
Oh yes. The wig!! Lets go Joe!! Hahaha
Best podcast ever 😊
The Comman Sense Skeptic channel  has dozens and dozens of videos maliciously breaking down all of Elons lies and scams. It's researched and presented by engineers and scientists who shatter the myth of Elon the genius.
Elon: I'll bet you a dollar (Laughs in rich af)
Cool
How much is the cyber truck?
I have my respects for Elon Musk but he is holding that cigar as if it was a diaper full of caca. But he is doing his damnedest to be one of the boys here at the same time. It must be tough to be a super genius billionaire and try to fit in as one of the boys like that.
If the space marines from avatar had cyber trucks they could have conquered the na'vi
Well I'll be! I might just need that dang old tin can battery my f150 won't do that. just ask my cousin Lenny he did that to a small block went right through I tell ya. Go musky I like it
you should have asked elon about his CIA connections and recent meeting with the Israelis
Anyone else forget it was Halloween? 😂
Lmao Joe dressed like that dude in the stands that looks like him with a wig…perfect 👌
Love the shirt Joe! 🇵🇷
Wild
What a horrendous vehicle
I want one
3:33 JRE SCIENCE 545 grain arrow 🏹 vs Cyber Truck
When is the Cyber Truck coming out!!? Ive been wanting one
Thought that was He Man
What is Joe’s costume? Lol
Joe looks like he-man😂
a 7000 lb pickup doing 0-60 in under 3 seconds, this thing is going to be insane!
Elons laugh has gotten more maniacal over time 😂
Elon is such a wizard
This will be a funny video when the cybertruck is considered an absolute disaster for Tesla.
This is the first time Joe has made me laugh after watching him for years. 🤣
ELON is a Pimp 💪🏼
Joe’s costume 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Rogans new hairstyle had me confused for a min 😂
Been waiting for this one
I cant believe i first seen this on @whatphoto channel😮❤❤❤
Wtf 😂
Joe looks like nick swardson in the benchwarmers.
This is my new favorite video
AI generated joe 😅😅😅
Joe really braught out the wig that was Eddie bravos idea from his latest episode
Damn cameraman going in on that gum
PUERTO RICO 🇵🇷
Some guy was smacking hard while recording 😂😂😂
I bet there are meds involved like in Limitless film
Joe Rogan lookin like HE-MAN
Joe Rogan with the Puerto Rico jersey and blonde hair 😂😂 Team Rubio??? Lol
You had an opportunity to take out a reptilian. Shame on you Joe
The guy chewing the gum while joe was shooting was incredible !
Who TF is chewing gum behind the camera ??
3 minutes ago??????
Love the costume 😂
Joe with the PR Jersey
Can survive a mag dump from a Tommy gun but Joe thinks he can penetrate the doors with an arrow??
Droopy face cigar hour 😂
They could make every car or truck look awesome as fk, we have examples of awesome looking vehicles, but for some reason they just dont
Puerto Rico en la casa puñeta
Happy Halloween! 🎃🚀
This was some good marketing 👁️
I'm surprised Elon didn't say I'll bet you one dogecoin 🤭🤭 🪙 🐶🏹
that damn focus
That Truck looks like the DeLorean from back to the future was crumpled like paper during time travel and then reexpanded. Its so ugly it looks like someone drove it out of a minecraft game.
omg wait what? xD also what's this hair 😂😂 6k views within the first 3 minutes 😆
Elon such a vibe😂 “fuck yeah”
Who’s chewey?
Hope you see this joe ❤❤😊
No one:  Joe: “Jamie put up that video of a Girzzly bear attacking a cyber truck”
Jeez, with that wig on Joe looks just like Rick Parfitt ..
Just imagine chillin' with Elon 😂😂😂
Joe looked at Jamey like he was about to fuck.
He might as well say he's aiming to get 0 to 60 below 1 second. It's never gonna happen. Thing will probably never come to production.
Is that Jimmy Saville
Joe arguing ft/lbs physics with Elon is hilarious
Electric cars are dead.
I love how in this clip, there is no acknowledging Rogan's look. Like its normal.
Please fire whoever was eating gum behind the camera. Awful noise
despite all the x stuff i love hearing these two guys talk
Joe and Elon are Top G’s!!
Gah i love this lol. Tht spark was wild!
Whats that song,  "Then i got high"?
My crossbow bolts hit way harder than my compound bow.
3:50 wtf is he chewing? Jeez...
This wasn't recorded on Halloween, Joe just wears that wig all the time in his personal life because he misses his hair that much
How can no one see this con man for what he is?
Such a sick costume
The thumbnail is from a nightmare lmaoo
I thought I seen that head come towards the camera 😅oops
Does beast mode have anti roll mode, Or a parachute mode too? Lol
The only interview i want to see from Joe Rogan Is with elon 😂, It Always turns into weird shit, either elon Is smoking a joint or Joe ends up with a Blondie wig 😂
Don't tell anyone it's Halloween. This is how Joe usually looks.
I just saw your cyber truck driving on the freeway!!! I was freaking out!!   I’m in Austin Tx driving a plumbing company truck!
Is there aerobars and kitkats in the conspiracy console
Aaaahhahahahha the fucking costume
lol what
I've never clicked on a video so fast....
Joe makes a pretty blond.
Joe is a good shill for Tesla.
Is Joe just loosing his mind with these outfits he is wearing more and more?  Its not Holloween everyday.
We need the candian twitter files elon❤❤❤
Ah joe yeah the wig is not working bro 😕
the wig😂😂
JOEEEEEE I LOVE YOUR SHIRT!!!!! BEST BASEBALL TEAM IN THE WORLD🎉🎉🎉🎉

X
WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR SOOO LONG 🔥
joe looks like he-mans aged badly
Arrow strong, car stronger
Seeing Elon smoking is oddly satisfying
New most Joe Rogan title ever dropped
Is this AI ?
Imagine chillin with Elon and then all of a sudden your shooting his car with an arrow 😂
Does it come with a motor mouth ?
Joe should grow his hair out more often :) looks fabulous.
Glad to see joe finally came out ❤❤❤
How do firefighters bust it open if need be?
Please tell me who Joe is supposed to be 😭😅
Joe being the lookalike from the baseball game for Halloween is fuckin perfect
Does anyone know how to watch with mobile on Spotify?
❤
❤
❤
ITS HAPPENING
Cross dressing cheerleader 😂❤ Arrows carry kinetic energy, Not the same as bullets. The arrow will go through an armored truck.  Something went wrong there, You need heavier arrows, those carbons transfer energy different, try aluminum
Hey Joe, something looks different!
❤
Elon is an alien.
Is this AI?
Alternate reality.
Love it
Go Elon
