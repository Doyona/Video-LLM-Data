So much in this video aged beautifully
20:05 that is truly terrifying with the lightning flash revealing the space-time bending monster slowly impending towards you as you attempt to run while being pulled within its grasp
19:45 DEFYING GRAVITY

Philza and tommyinnit: trying to beat the game Slimesicle and allegation haver: doing science and maybe making a cult again

Man 5:32 really aged well.
THANK YOU FOR 15K MILLION SUBS
20:56 the captions: “phil we gotta *wun* we gotta run”
I can’t believe the big bit of the video was Mr. Beast being a godly entity that ruled over hell and controlled the black hole
Because you were one of Technoblade friends so I’m going to subscribe
21:00 ...Well that aged like milk
Wilbur really did feel like p Diddy😭

"I cant believe that you implied that mrbeast is the lord of hell"  Well that aged well didnt it?
Still waiting on the tinder thing you know
That mrbeast bit aged so well considering the current situation
Alternate title: dr cicle and professor soot go off and cause experiments only to die, Tommy and philza beat the game like normal human beings only to come back and die alone and afraid
Massive? You know what else is massive?
20:58 BRUUUUUU, that did not age well!
17:14
5:00 the captions are wrong i just noticed 😭

20:54 WE GOTTA WUN
19:58  bro that was terrifying as fuck
12:47 Wilbur be cheating💀💀💀
The whole Mr Beast bit in this video is under a whole new light now.  Feels like it was foreshadowing.

6:45 Oh Well then he is in the right place for what he has done
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME POLLEN?!
14:23 tommy is the biggest cheater ever💀
6:45 due to recent events it’s no surprise that “THE BEAST” ended up in the depths of HELL
DON'T SAY BAD WORD
wilbur: "wha-" Tommy: "wilbah?" Wilbur: *fucking dies*
7:08 for anyone wondering what the TRUE translation of the word is, it's 'Damnation in Latin is the true Latin'
Nibbler: they are all 14 Me being 14, 3 years after this was made-
21:02 this didn't age well 💀💀💀💀
20:58 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

5:29 he might be right
21:01
p diddy is talked about at 21:02
20:50 this aged soooo badly
4:52 the chat color switchs (wilbur had purple)
“wake up in the morning feelin like p diddy”  this aged well
i love how Charlie just says “hee hee” and then screams in pain and then follows up with “ima going in a black hole”
The mr beast joke is extra funny now
20:59 that aged poorly
The editor on this video was having a little bit of a black hole crisis himself it seems with the coloring of the subtitles
The dramatic entrance and i like it 21:29
this didn't age well now that i know the allegations of wilbur
21:01 Diddy
After watching this in 2024 After p diddy case were not gonna talk about that😂
PLAY PREESURE IN ROBLOX! SEE SEBASTIAN!!!!!!!!!!
2024 quote “if you are struggling do not ever ever give up” Furky October 4 Friday 9:11 PM 2024
21:00 oh the irony 😭🙏

5:30 this aged like milk and wine at the same time
6:46 This aged like milk lmaoooo
5:34 Well, well, well...

I’m going into a black hole🎶🎶🎤🎵
Join
i miss the old wilbur
That MrBeast line aged SO well! :D
I wish Wilbur didn't... Go down his path... So much potential only to burn to idiocy and spite.
okay but why are the moments 20:05 and 21:43 so fucking good???
Im the latest commen
The way the black hole just flew so fast towards them at the end was scary as hell
This is also me when I smoke… weed? 😭 I can’t bro slimecicle is too funny
That Mr beast comment aged immaculately
Just Cause 3 soundrack here is amazing
20:59 …
this video aged like fine wine 🗿🍷
20:05 that scream
tommy and wibur are an example of true brotherhood.
5:20
do it in hardcore next time lol
20:05 is like the wither storm
The P. Diddy referenced in an age while 21:07
"Hee hee!" Famous last words
wiliam and charlie the best duo fr fr
that mrbeastisthedarklordofhell joke is aging like wine
20:58 aged horribly…
5:30 with the new alagations, mr beast might just actually be the lord of hell
20:05 is sick.
22:55
ay tommy was not wrong 5:31
Lol, tommy, Mr. Beast of hell, that ages bad bruh 😂
I’m 14 and I understood every single one of those references
I'ma going in a black hole
At this year he has his goal 2x at 14M I’m happy for ya
20:46 HAMILTON REFERENCE?!
HAMILTOON REFERENCE
surprised wilbur didnt eat it tbh
7:07 actually (possibly) translates to:  damnationem latine: damnation in Latin  hoc est verum latine: this is true Latin    This was translated by horizontally flipping the image and then translating the phrase through google translate so tell me if I’m wrong
Charlie is the funniest person in this video, (sorry I’m late.)
21:00  that p diddy line didnt last too well.
It’s the strongest block in game! Obsidian It’s bedrock 😂
His f*ckin scream 😂😂😂 20:05
Every tommyinnit mod video Philza: grinding and prolly the first to get diamonds  Tommyinnit: doesnt do anything at start but grinds in the end  Wilbur and charlie: in a cult
20:59 well that part didn't age well 💀
anyone know any tommy videos (except new vids) without wilbur.?
Sad that the big man scripts even the funniest mods..
5:21 makes sense
uhm ackshewally, this isnt realistic because a black hole the size of a penny could easily destroy earth :nerd_face: :point_up:
The Halo Music XD
21:54 gee that black hole doesn’t sucks that place where the Ender dragon shows?
14:11   w h a t
7:09 Wilbur’s backwards massage translates to: “damnation” in Latin is “truth” in Latin.
Charlie's "Final Hypothesis" literally sound like a movie line... "IF I GET SUCKED IN, THEN WHAT? I DON'T KNO-"
This is the black will swallows. Your spawn is literally hard-core at that point. Until you get to bed and then it eats the bed so basically you’ll never get to keep responding.
I like your videos you’re hilarious
20:10 laser beam jetpack :)
7:50 you can see in chat that philza is in creative
14:10 “IF I get sucked in, IF I get sucked in, IF I get sucked in,”
this video single handedly mad my day i remember watching this when it came out seeing a video about the mod made me remember about it and me just thinking about the video made me laugh bro i missed laughing so hard
Phil carried
20:59 that didn’t age well
That black hole is small. SO it can kill. Big black holes have less death zones.
Its sad re-watching this after the wilbur stuff came out :(
20:03
Today we made a black hole mod for real life  Stated by Mr beast
POV. You’re currently a minor and understood every reference
16:58 ARE YOU F**KING KIDDING ME?!?! Argh! You could've phrased this any other way!
the fact i got every reference charlie and wilbur made is hillarious to me
tommyinnit:Go speak to karl jacobs
CaseOh was growing the entire time, CaseOh is the black hole.
my future son: "Dad, what happens when people die?"  Me: 15:30
This is the most funniest shit I've seen in years😂😂😂
It's kinda hard to watch this after the whole Wilbur situation, like he disgusts me but. I miss these videos
6:13 that's honestly my reaction to anything serious
World litteraly ending,philza just playing the game normally
At 8 minutes in the bottom left corner tommy sets ph1lza's game to creative
F***
las vegas sphere
Full name, Dr. Charlie SlimeCircle who was the lucky subscriber all he needed to do to come back to life from being teared Atom from Atom was sell his soul to the dark Lord of hell MR BEAST
If this was hardcore, Phil would be the only one left in less than a minute. Think about that for a second
14:26 Tommy just cheating
Oh no my cocaine went flying off the table into the black hole😂😂
Black hole Ton-618
I subscribe
Everyone: *in water escaping the black hole*  Phill: *doing a speed run in the meanwhile*
Imma goin’ in a black hole. He he AAAAAHHH -Charlie
20:45 OMG MY FAV MUSICAL HAMILTON EEEEE
3yrs=8million subs
Total deaths.   Slimecicle 10  Tommy 5  Philza 2  Wilbur 14
“Im going in a black hole” had me spilling milk everywhere😂 (mom was not happy😬)
4:58 whhy are their laughs in sync
The message that MrBeast said to Wilbur was:  Damnationem latine, hoc est verum latine.  If anybody knows what this actually means, reply with a theory.
22:53
Blatantly cheating but its funny 😂
Tommy: RUNNNNN Wilbur: Kill Me Slime: *runs towards black hole* Science. Philza: AHHHHHhhh-
This look like the black hole look like 🕳
This look like the black hole look like 🕳
This look like the black hole look like 🕳
Give them an oscar🏆🏅
This is honestly the most lore filled video Tommy has ever made
I love how Philza was the one actually getting shit done while everyone else just kept dying and being idiots.
Tommy really likes black holes
3 years later, he's at 14 million
20:44 ELIZAAAAA
22:06 had me dead
I subbed and liked and I’m a old person
20:59 did not age well 💀
Nah not Tommy cheating I saw him set his game mode to survival and lost his mending leggins
"Wait which one tommy"💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Can we please see this into a series?
Slimecicle is funny who agrees  👇
1:52 For anyone wondering the song is called The Airship and its from Cuphead
8:47 I’m crying rn
MrBeast is HUGE LOSER
14:11 Subtitle error!
OH EDITOR. messed up the subtitle colors at 4:46
Wilbur:🧑‍🔬 Silmecicle:🐟 Philza:Speedrun Tommy:AHHHHHHHHHHHAHHHHHHH
“pHiLzAaaaaa, I don’t like black holesss” Racist Tommy
Tommy, I'm sorry you didn't win. Turns out the black hole is the true winner in the end!
I love large and black holes 🕳️😎🤤
18:02 whats the bgm rock music when philza is playing?
2:16 caught me off guard wilbur why wh why did you slurp the dirt
21:49 this part was so intense bro
He got long then he was gone, he got wide and then he died.  -slimccl
1:26 Three years later and Slime has officially become the next Michael Jackson but more political.
damnation in Latin and this is true latin is what mr beast said to Wilbur fyi
BH?you mean BH from BFB TPOT
/effect @s night_vision 9999 255
You mean 15 million
Philza: *actually trying to beat the game* Literally everyone else: *causing chaos*

Grub cheated look 5:37 slime cicles a cheater
Subscribe for Tommy
Everything you said I know  but I'm 17
Some are 9
Rare footage of black hole not preventing death
I love watching tommyinit
20:06 scariest thing in this game (other than cave sounds i mean HOLY FU-)
Damnationem latine hoc est verum latine 7:14
Knew the references
i used the snipping tool and powerpoint to reverse what he said was : damnationem latine, hoc est verum latine, which trancelates to : damnation in Latin, this is true in Latin .
7:08 i kenw that this text was mirrored so i used a mirror to see what it said it said "The Condemnation of Latine" and "This is true in Latin" in Latin ( I used google translate so if anyone know how to speak Latin ig pls correct me if i said it worng.
Charlie:Come take a Bite philza
Coming back, it’s nice to hear Halo music still in videos
Weird looking back at these now
Was philza in creative mode for a little bit
dam
the idea of four people clamoring to get into the end with a black hole that will devour and delete anything in its path approaching rapidly, and then upon arrival only three people remaining, is kind of terrifying. they turn back and see charlie get eaten out of existence and all they can do is push forward
20th time watching this
fun fact: at 14:24 exatcly you can see the coords of the fortress.
The black hole was super fast😅
2 years ago he was close to 7mil. now he's almost to 15mil.
hm sus 14:22
I'm not 14 im f***ing 11  Edit: now I'm 12🙂
13:04 Ah yes, he's got his priorities straight
Im not any of the ages that Tommy said watch his channel and I knew all of Wilbur and Charlies “old” references
is it just me or Did Tommyinnit only get famous because his FRIENDS are very funny.
"You don't need sex to lay an egg"...Wilbur...I thought you went to school...
I’m 14 and I understood all of those references…….
Aaa
i got all those references when i was under 14 so HAH WILL
13:42  It’s moments like these and the “Every 5 minutes there’s a disaster” that reminds me just how good Charlie is at acting
I re-watched this video and i am not joking but they cheated over 30 times from teleporting to using creative mode to changing the weather to even locating the nearest fortress with commands and using perfect editing to hide it all like this video is just a joke
21:23 in the video wilber cheats by going to creative mode by the way at this point they have cheated 20 times IM NOT JOKING I could make a whole video talking of how much they cheat
19:07 in the video tommy cheats by changing the weather using a command it's not much but it's interesting cause he actually cheats before that to find the fortress
14:24 in the video Tommy cheats and uses a command to find the nearest fortress is
😭
Wilbur: the scientist Slimecicle: the assistant Philza: the resources Tommy: the noise
How does Wilbur just pull literally anyone into the most random bits ever
IM 8
Technoblade when he sees the black hole: Bruhhhh
"Philza was killed by Iron golem"    Me:We saw Nothing 😇 we saw Nothing, We will just skip 10+ seconds after. We saw Nothing 😇   Btw are we gonna talk about how Tommy finally tried to win game w Philza?
THE HAMILTON REFERENCE 😭😭😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏
Some are 8
charles got a haircut and wilbur is using a floating boat on a black hole
20:05 That lightning flash was very cinematic
Late to the party, but wilbur's demonic latin translates to "Damnation, this is the truth" or "this is true damnation" or, the captions do, anyway. also the latin word for latin was used in both sentences
Why the fuck at the end will just be singing Kanye 💀
this was painful to watch everyone except wilbur were geeks, i hope phil grows some eyebrows soon
2 years later double the subscribers
"the hole"
17:59  ABLBLBLB -Slimesicle
from 13:27 to 13:29 the subtitles are wrong
I love how Philza gradually forgets about the others and the black hole and starts doing a vanilla lets play
bruh slimecicle used gamemode in the end area
“He got long and then he was gone, he got wide and then he died.”- Charlie 😂😂😂
Cus I am going into a black hole #1:24
Philza!watch the kids!
Philza being a badass with some persona music in tbe backround
14:25 Were not going to talk about Tommy using /locate to find the nearest fortress.
Phil: tries his best to speed run and succeeds Tommy: incredibly stressed about the impending doom Dr. Cicle: encouraging the populace to be spagetified,  Wilbur soot: telling his friends about the afterlife, what is beyond the void, And jamming out to good songs
intirestign
Have you illegally installed tinder yet
Btw a true man doesent die when he dies he dies when hes forgoten
6:31 I NEVER SEEN THAT MESSAGE WHEN I WAS WATCHING TILL THE END, THIS IS PROBABLY VIDEO-CHANGING TO ME
When Wilbur is speaking of what Mr beast told him, backwards Latin appears on the screen. Translation of said captions: “damnation” in Latin is “truth” in Latin.
why do you swear tommy

Ok cool not as cool as Doni ha 😈
Rip Wilbur soot- last words “WAHHHHHHHH” may you rest in peace with 3 million orbies
5:46
lol 😂😂
Wilbur sounds like “The Doctor” in The baby in yellow from 6:19-7:12
why
That makes it a block hole.
Love the Alexander Hamilton reference there   I am also 13 btw and got every single song reference
Is it only me that saw Tommy using the /locate command and someone going back to survival?
Phil is the party’s provider
first person to comment after 2024
Tommy if you see this can you pls play the forest or sons of the forest with the boys? Like Phil?
bro you milked this thumbnail for 3 videos
“Well if I tell the black hole that I’m on tinder maybe it won’t suck me” -Tom Simons
Wilbur making references that he thinks no one knows. I KNOW ALL OF THEM
Incase you are wondering, the backwards letters put forward are: Bamnationem latin lorc est verum latine
16:39 oh we're fucking dead
they successfully made this a horror film
They sure love going in black holes
Ya know I think this might be my favourite of the mod series actually!
16:32 Yoo! Just Cause 3 music! "Tem alguem ai? Responda agora... puta merda." -JC3 police radio guy
Technoblade never dies
21:25 now that was epic.
willy burson
"OH, I'm so longgg."  Subtitles: IF I get sucked in
i'm 10
We got to wun😂
I can’t believe this is from 2y ago😭
Ah, first video I ever watched of tommy, how nostalgic
I'm 8
20:05 that moment had no business being so epic and terrifying.
Philllllll
21:18 this moment could NOT have been better timed if you tried
Wilbur would actually be a FUCKING amazing writer- I want to speak to this man PLEASEE
🥚🥚🥚
Wilbur playing Clash royale made me very sad and happy at the same time
🎵I’m going in black hole🎵
Mod please
19:47 I feel like a meme can be made of this moment
7:54 and check the chat
I’m 10
Man just said my real name irl
yooo tommy was last one to diee 🥶🥶
We saw ohiza being set to creative 7:56
5:36 ayy me and the black hole share a name
Phil being the only one actually playing the game in these videos is the funniest thing to me
lol
7:08 so the flipped text reads "damnationem latine hoc est verum latine," which from Latin translates to "'damnation' in Latin is 'truth' in latin'"
I’m 11… yep, I’m 11.
I love how Everyone thinks a 10 year old won’t see this video and know all the songs they are singing is funny
Black hole is inevitable. Black hole is- 🕳️ 🕳️🕳️🕳️🕳️ 🕳️🕳️ 🕳️🕳️ 🕳️🕳️
6:20 20:23 20:55
3:44
fun fact: the subtitles for mrbeasts demonic speech at 7:08 are actually latin but mirrored and roughly translate to "fuck latin, this is real latin"
Who miss the super super funny guy
Oh my god I’m in astronomy rn I’ve just learned spaghettification is REAL
14:11 AI: IF I get sucked in IF I get sucked in reality:ohhhh~~~ guys I so long
THE LOOK OF BETRAYAL ON TOMMY’S FACE AT 15:11
17:40 tho😅
Bamnationen Latine hoc est verum latine    Is wat mr beast said to wilbur
I love Wilburs incentive to try to stop the black hole by being a scientist
this feels so fuckin fake
1:23 - Micheal Jackson. Both alive and dead.
The fact that i was 12 when this came out and i still get the references makes me wonder… just a lot of wondering…   Then again i may have just re-watched glee a few too many times, considering i have a google doc with which seasons i rewatched the most
Just the casual message Wilber soot ste game to creative
Wilbur: "What's the most obscure reference we can make that just tommy's fans will not understand, they're all fourteen, they where born in 2000"  **Me who listens to 90's songs yet being born in 2008**
Everyone else: Mostly normal trying to beat the game   Wilbur: Just being insane while fucking roleplaying
1:20  Tommy: “Its like we’re moonwalking!” Charlie: *”Ima goin’ in a black hole”* Me: *dies*
Im 9
9:05 phaha you just fu-  when- how the- phoho  Dude what you want to say
The lighting reveal.
14:25 they  Used  COMMANDS
we gotta wun
Massive? Black? Hole?
2:35
☑️
I SAW IT THEY WENT IN CREATIVE 5:30 TO 6:00 IF YOU LOOK IN THE BOTTOM LEFT! HA
What  the f,,;f
No that not realistic a black hole the size of a quarter can end the world I’m not kidding if you don’t believe me look it up on google than😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🥲😢😢😢😢😅
Fun fact: the second thing Tommy is afraid of is voids! Its from the rising void mod.
One problem I find with this is that the editor keeps mixing up Charlie’s and Wilbur’s subtitles color.
i love how wilbur’s and charlie’s subtitles keep switching
Did anybody realize that Charlie’s subtitles were purple instead of lime and Wilbur’s were lime instead of purple 🤡🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🐀🤡Edit: not always though also it’s true but I’m joking 😅
If philza wasn't in these videos nothing would get done.
7:08 translates to "damnationem latine hoc est verum latine" apparently, idk what it means but okay and if u translate latin to english it gives you: ""damnation" in Latin is "truth" in Latin"
i knew all of charlie and wilburs songs
Sth I feel like animating on my other phone 8:41 to 8:48 9:10 to  9:43 10:24 to 11:13 11:54 to 12:53 13:14 to 14:01 16:08 to 16:20
wilbur experienced the effects of made in heaven
Some are 10
anyone notice the game chat 👀 ( 21:23 )
Anyone else notice that Phil only died once? It the end. Everyone else died at least 3 times.
0:12 2 years later and he's 10 million subs ahead
"THE BLACK HOLE IS TRYING TO CONTROL ME!" Wilbur became a Roblox Roleplayer 💀
in two years, you would double your sub count wow!
" He he AHH! OHH!" Famous Last Words By Micheal Cicle
im 11
Wilbur just casually dropped, "I called to the stars and they laughed at me"
Depending on the microscope, they can get pretty hot, so Wilbur isn't really wrong. I've almost burned myself on a (very old) light microscope.
W @vini2003
22:23 Phill clutching
1:25
I reversed the text wilber said and translated it to english heres wat is said bamnatione in Latin, this is the true Latin
I already know that Tommy's videos will be childhood nostalgia classics for so many kids
Im sorry but look at 10:08😅
5:40 Ton 618
20:06    *prowler sound effect*
Will and Charlie putting their degrees to use while british boy gets sucked in a black hole
I love Wilbur’s reaction to Charlie dieing
Hi
20:58 Just charlie and wilbur singing TiKToK - Ke$ha
Remember when subtitles were optional?
11:30 Philza And Tommy Ocean ‘Unters! Going Out To Get Grub For Missus! this always makes me laugh uncontrollably😂😂😂
7:07 use a mirror
From 4:46 Charlie and Wilbur swapped caption colours
I feel like doni bobes is a copy of tommyinnit, they’re videos feel scripted.
I love the fact that the text colours of Charlie and Wilbur keep swapping 4:52
black hole
LOL
21:00 man made of slime and british man sing tiktok
Im 0.1
Fun Fact: The Black Hole mod makes the Nether and the End the only safe locations
MrBeast is such a monster
21:24 that’s the moment he knew he fucked up
Wisp ho do you think is betr  tomy or you
nobody talking about how he cheats
BRUH U 14M SUB
this reminds me of the wither storm
6:39
Jokes on you I had a fucking Hamilton phase in year 6 way later than it came out
20:04 Can everyone appreciate that lighting bolt timing
I'm rewatching some of these mod videos bc I'm on a Charlie Slimecicle kick (I've watched so many clip complications, it's ridiculous), and I find it so funny watching this after being obsessed with JRWI multiple times and hearing him say "let's Just Row With It"
Is it me or did tommy use /locate😅
Tommy and Wilbur sitting in a boat looking cute
the black holes name is  “Warframe Wisp Prime no shroud”, look him up
2 years later and his subscribers have doubled
I'm 13, and i know every song slimcicle and willber soot were singing
lol 🤣😂
the fact that they use creative mode
Bro started rapping 21:41
"where I have much time because I'm young" -tommyinnit 2023
pls song list
4:53 charlie and wilbur's text colors are swapped
Mod link?
Everytime wilbur is in these videos he ends up starting a cult or just goes insane.
tommy can you sent to me mod? pls ?_?
Why are we not talking about how perfect that chicken egg noise was?! 3:12
I 9 on my mom's account
May i note that tommy made Philza in creative 7:49
Back in February I was I produced to hamilton, a couple months later I get into dream smp and find out u guys like it too😂whats ur favorite song from hamilton? Mine is your obedient servant.
Hey you will see techno again I am sorry for your loss.🥺
I'm spaghetti a noodle
in here puberty never ends!!! that got me
20:05 should be thumbnail 😂
8:46 he got elongated, then he desintegrated. He got spaghettified and straight up died. He got really tall and took a fall.
5:53 racist tommy innit???
14:10 the captions where wrong
Its that thing from fortnite
14:45😂😂😂😂
18:27 I love the famous ttrpg podcast, just row with it, where they all die in a black hole. My favorite character is Gillian Widestrider, champion of the black hole (I ran out of puns for the name).
Slimecicle, wen't in creativ
12:55
@WolburSoot I'M A GOD DAM 13-YEAR-OLD YOU PRICK, FOR ONCE YOUVE OFFENDED ME TRULY AND I'M MAD
still watching you old videos
Ya know as a youngen myself the obscure references that Wilber and Charlie were making were my childhood
To 4:46 to 5:00 Charlie’s text and Wilbur’s text are swapped
I’m probably the only 12 year old that understood the stronger reference
Why do u swear so much
Is it sad i know EVERY word in Hamilton the musical?
17:37 the video casually goes into the black hole
Love the black hole mod
I’m 13 and got all of Wilbur and Charlie’s references 🤣
14:24 we just gonna ignore the thing in the bottom left ok
Wassup Tommyinit
I love the P5 battle music while Phil's off beating the game
14:25 Tommy caught locating the fortress 😮
Phil is just beating the game while the others are in boats XD
YouTube: Hey you watched this 10 times in 2021, why not watch it again?
When slimecicle said "Guys im so long" While tommyinnit was going through the nether portal The text bubble showed "IF i get sucked in,"
damnationem latine hoc est verum latine. ok then-
7:09 roughly translates to “Damnation in Latin, this is true in Latin”
why is wilber so poetic.
big suck
according to google translate you said  damnation in latin is truth in latin
why is wilbur always the first person to die and tommys the second in the mod vids lol
Everyone of tommys viewers are 14 im 11 man
Don't swear
14:10 editing mistake, GO TO BED IF YOUR TIRED OF EDITING
21:33 the best thing Tommy’s said
14:25 you can see tommy cheats the location of the fortress
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂
Tommy: Wait thé black holes not following me? It was programmed to follow me- *Will and Charlie die in chat* Tommy: :O Tommy: Wait Phil? PHIL!
7:03 so the subtitles for what Wilbur said is literally just Latin written backwards so i translated it and says " "damnation" in Latin is "truth" in Latin " but I'm guessing it was just meant to say "damnation is truth". just a cool detail i wanted to point out :)
HEHE 1:25
I wonder where u got this idea from…
I'm younger than u said I'm younger  than 14
Waww minicraftt😅😅😅
I was born in 2008
Everything was funny for about 21 minutes but then, it gets intense.
In 7:06 when the backwards text pops up, it’s saying “damnationem latine hoc est verum latine” which translates to “damnation" in Latin is "truth" in Latin” so do with that what you will
Did you download tinder yet
Lost my phone well watching that's how bad it was
this is easily the most dramatic mod video
i love how the 3 are just goofing around and trying to escape the hole while philza is speedrunning the actual game just not giving a fuck
The halo music on the egg experiment is golden
Man I love black holes
20:05 Is so Stressful
Tommy waited his entire life and YouTube carrier just to say “IM FRIENDS WITH MR BEAST”
22:08
CHARLIE AND WILBUR SINGING AT THE END WITH THE BEST CRAP IVE SEEN ON YOUTUBE ALL DAY
2:32 what’s the second thing your scared of?
1:25 “ima going in a black hole”😂😂😂❤
😂😂😂😂😂
Summury for the video:  As the black hole gets intradused to the gang, Wilbur soot uses the black hole as an opportunity for experimentation, getting himself killed twice in the prosses and getting Charlie Slimesicle killed once. Wilbur, now known as Professor Soot, and Slimesicle, now known as Dr Sicle, do expirements such as seeing if projectiles will get sucked into the black hole and how water is affected by the pull of gravitatinal void that is the black hole. At some point before the successful experiments start, Professor Soot gets infected by the black hole after his first time getting killed by it, now in a constant battel to regain control over his body until he gose to hell and is now in alignment with the infectious particles.
Everytime wilburs in these videos hes either: Insane, Possessed, or on some crack
Always pray to mrbeast
7:09 thanks to google translate and not the demonic entity that haunts every thought I have and every action I take, Wimbler said "damnation in Latin" for the first phrase and "This is true in Latin" for the second phrase:}
Bah little do they know I have WII JUST DANCE
Coincidentally I built a black hole with command blocks and then I hopped to YouTube and see another black hole
I love how Wilber basically has admin commands but only uses it once for obsidian
Tommy: why aren’t you all stressed like me  Charlie: the most stressed I’ve been is when my clan got raided  Everyone: laughs  And people watching this aren’t only 14-18 years old but my ass being 10-12 lol
Bamnationem latine hoc est verum latine is what Mr beast said..hmm
also how does wilbur’s mc skin show emotion- is that just me?
every single mod video tommy does when phil is in it, he always acts the same. phil is always the one to actually play the game and everyone else is going insane and doing weird bits
when you delete a world
The fact I'm 12 and ik every single reference wilbur and Charlie said is hilarious
i'm 12 🙂😇
they needed to lurn about molecular biology to figure out that a black hole is a small particle which will infinitely grow in width and length and a small chance in some science they'll go to a alternate universe where they have different versions and will se them.
i love being in big black holes
I love how Charlie and Will attempted to mate a Adult chicken and a Baby chicken, do you want to tell them or should I?
OH MY F*** GOD
@tommyInnit
Not me understanding every reference and being a little younger than 14 lol
What I hate about Wilbur is that he always has to make a dumb story
twitters gonna be all over this
8:44
I love that they just spit Hamilton songs
"the black hole is over there sucking and I'm over here sucking" hmmmm... Strange
20:44 Slimecicle is looking for a mind at work
I'm 8
“Its over there and it’s sucking and I’m over here and I’m sucking” inspirational quote of the day
I saw the intro. 6:18
Wilbur: talking about what he saw in death Tommy: “you wanna shoot hoops?”  Honestly I found this hilarious
I am watching this video for the third time
5:44 almost correct. Infinitely dense
22:05 slimesicle went to creative mode mhhhh
21:28
Fun fact at 7:07 when Wilbur speaks Latin if you flip the image around and translate the text to English it reads:  “This is true in Latin” And “Damnation in Latin”
Was it just me that got all of those references from Wilbur and slimecicle
i love how everyone is just joking around, having a good time, and rowing boats, while Phil is just beating the game in the background, and Tommy, wilbur and charlie dont even know
Tommy: “I don’t like black holes It’s one of the two things scared of”
20:06 that thunder was a paid actor.
Font is called Nunito, your welcome
Dude 1:25 to 1:27 is the best 2 seconds of the video llol
Pov ur 14 and understood both refrences
7:53 philza went to creative
I love when all these colab 😊
I just realized that there was a subtitle error at 14:10
Just a reminder Tommy doubled his subscriber count in a little over 2 years
Great to see Mr. Beast finally make an appearance in a tommy vid
I love how when Tommy can’t see the black hole at 19:55 it just strikes lightning and then he can see it it’s just so fcking cool
20:28 haha jokes on them I have older sisters
WHAT ARENA IS WILBUR IN THO
16:29 what music is that
Tommy: PHIL BEAT THE GAME WELL YOU CAN KEEP MINING *2 seconds later* PHIL TELL ME WHEN I CAN JUMP DOWN phil: *complete silence*
bro you have 14mln rn
i love how phil was grinding like mans was going pro gamer mood
Slime:🎵Eliza and peg-🎵 Me: HAMILTON REFERENCE (Also sings the rest of the song)
Who was controlling it
2 things Tommyinnit is afraid of number one black holes number two WOMEN
The way the lightning lit up the black hole was something straight out of a horror movie 20:05
Love how Tommy and philza are playing normally but the Wilbur and slimecicle are doing a serious roll play
19:32 Tommy and Charlie: *panicking of impending doom* Wilbur: I won
If you didn't know spaghettifacation is a real thing when you enter a black hole and you get long
7:08 to anyone curious, backwards the subtitles roughly translate to "Damnation in Latin. This is true in Latin" and I found that really funny
14:44 me when i realize i have acne and it won't go away
Mrbeast is Love  Mrbeast is life  Mrbeast is our morals
I'm the gold3nboy
The time when the lighting strike and see the black hole menacing
Slimecicle’s Michael Jackson impressions are always just perfect!
i have come back to this video to say one thing: black holes don't suck ij matter like a black hole, it's a mix of extreme gravity and spinning faster than the speed of light that pulls things into them
im 12
Tommy i wish you see this comment and if u did, wazzup.
I personally prefer my holes Hispanic but I won’t judge your preference, Tommy
Its nice to watch this when Tommy has almost doubled his subs by now
Charlie makes these videos 10 times better🤣
TRAVIS SCOTT!!!!!!!!!!
21:22 DONT STOPP
1:22 ehe oh OH
🎵BELIEVING! HOLD ON TO THAT FEELING!🎵
YO THE WAY TOMMY SAID HE COULDNT SEE THE BLACK HOLE THEN LIGHTNING STRUCK AND HE COULD SEE IT WAS SO COOL
20:54 21:19
This is my 2nd favorite mod that they have played🤣👍
14:24 : nearest fortress i at [-320, .....] bruh
the fact that philza is actually the guy whos doing things and others are just chilling
The black hole wasn’t sucking them in it was just controller drift
The fact I knew every song reference that Wilbur made is funny considering he said that 18 year olds wouldn’t know them
The clash of clan Anitials are coc
7:08 ''this is true in Latin, damnation in Latin'''  --Wilbur Soot
I’m 16 and I knew every song Wilbur and slimecicle sang… maybe I’m just educated in the wrong fields
The scyler sisters
😂
I Personally Do Not Like Ke$ha
i found a highscore sync reference from 0:48
7:56 in chat you can see tommy set philza to creative
im 11
😅 at least wilber won the game on 19:33
Wilbur and Charlie just know I was fourteen when I saw this. I understand ever single reference because I'm cultured :) I hope I've made you both proud.
Three of us are 11 years old
Black hole? Is it because its bla-
men set gamemode
20:06 "I cant see it"
14:24 Tommy stop cheating
A black hole as I understand it is mass alot of it smished into a small enough area that it turns into a black hole but it can only be open for about a few seconds
HAMILTON 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
I love how many times they cheat. Examples in the video: teleporting and switching modes (creative, spectater and back to survival) and also in his “try not to laugh” video's. He forgets to reset the hearts so many times Edit: i know some of it is for the entertainment for the video but still
Did anyone even notice Charlie and Wilbur singing Hamilton?!?!?!
Honestly all of Tommy's videos send tears running down my face from laughing so much.
20:06 this was probably the best part😂
He has earned 6 million subs in 2 years Gg tommy
A very intense scene I've ever seen 💀 21:40
this was a whole movie
Slimesicle and Philza; yeah uh Wilbur’s dead. Tommy: but he was my friend so he isn’t dead!
Didint wilbur mean the singularity when he said infinetly small
Where do u find a black hole? In Tommy’s video 😂
Can you do another black hold video except this time it's in the sky. Also sex mod legit?
BEAT THE GAME WHILE YOU CAN PHILZA
I got all of the obscure references you made
16:16 the music from when you are in a fight from just cause 3!
Imma going in the blackhole
Funny story, they DID call me piss pants in school and it was bc I had some yellow hot topic pants
He got thick then he lost his di-
I’m 13 and all of the references that Will and Charlie made I understood!
14:24 is the funnist momment tommy just uses cheats
I feel like these videos always just have Wilbur start a cult in the first three minutes phill just disappears for like ten minutes then just shows up with like a lot of good shit and Tommy just trying to make his video 😂 (I suck at English so i apologize if this makes no sense)
6:09 6:34 6:40 6:53 15:37  wtf 💀
1:25
7:19 this translates to "damnation in Latin, this is the truth in Latin."
I I sub
Can we use science and the power of MrBeast To exterminate all mailboxes??
super mario in real life.  spaghetti!
yes
I saw the mistake of slime's text was purple 0:55
He doubled his subs in 2 years wtf
20:05  Horror movie moment
14:11 You kind of messed up on the subtitles
They should make this a movie
MrBeast
Pisspantsinnit
whaaaaaaaaaaaa whatt are you talking about- i'm gonna be 15 in 8 DAYS thats close enough v-v  (20:25) also i am aware that this video was posted over two years ago so i technically would have been 12 not 14 but still-
It was fun watching his videos Now that the dsmp I cant wait to for the qsmp
Wilbur and Charlie: Tommy's fans won't understand our references.   Me: *singing along to every song because my mother's are fucking AWESOME*.
Wilbur always goes insane in these vids
20:33 I was born in the 2000’s and I understand this completely
11:01 but then I had a very good idea I used f5 using a F5 give me a whole new perspective and I could see the water that I couldn't see before
I love how they made references that SPECIFICALLY 2000s kids would know instead of ones they wouldn't.
15:52 u look at the top of the screen u will see herobrine
14:44 "IN HERE, PUBERTY NEVER ENDS!"
1:24
"Philza we gotta WUN" 20:55
'Nited Kingdom
5:32 "can't believe you just implied that Mr. Beast is the lord of hell"
Alternate title: Tommy and Phil beat the game while Charlie and Wilbur role play 😂
14:24 Tom exposed?? 😂
😆😘😍I JOVE YOU
there's legit backwards latin at 7:07, it translates to "this is the truth of damnation." not sure if it's a reference to something
"Male chickens dont lay eggs, why were you calling it a HEEeeeeEee"
Did they really think I wouldn’t know Toxic by Britney Spears, are they serious.
This video is racist "black" hole
20:05 is literally terrifying, like seeing The Kracken at sea in an unforgiving storm.
I was also inside a black hole once
16:30 Pizza Tower music? I know it's not but there's a part in Unexpectency that sounds just like that. Right before Peppino snaps actually.
Tommy spotted a fucking lava cave with his ears. Magic 🪄
PRAY
Bro got wide… then he died…  deep 👊😔
How does this 🕳️ to this ⚫
4:59 they harmonized that laugh
I love how I know more than half of the songs that Wilbur and Charlie sang, even though I’m 15
How many people noticed the cuphead soundtrack for background music
yal ever just watch him when uour sad? me too like im being fr i havent eatched him in so long
Hey Charlie how do you want to die? -Sun Tzu Art of War
The golden age of TommyInnit.
Mod name is "Black Hole" You know its right when it has the video
I watched MrBeast before this
LOVE THESE VIDS AS ALWAYS, KEEP GOING TO,MY!!!!!
Tommy :phillllll    just being a baby arond philza is cute
I like how while Tommy is talking about drugs and Slimeccile and Wilbur are doing experiments on what will get wide, philza just keeps on speedrunning.
0:55 Charlie's green color in the subtitles I mistakingly replaced with wilburs

Bro they put persona 5  music in the background when Philza was getting ender pearls 0-0
Tommy: Reddit Charlie: *Slimes away*
underrated joke: Wilbur: it’s an infinitely small particle. Charlie: well listen, mr science man dunno it’s lookin’ pretty big from here!
not a debt one good for you man
It was playing just cause 3 music for a second
Philz’s: speed run Tommy:  Polar bear.
14:24 he looks at the coordinates of the fortress
That not how black holes work
while wilbur is getting hilariously plunged into the black hole, tommyinnit is talking about tinder and his new shack
14:24
i saw that command to find a fortress
Me from the 2011
If this gets pinned I will shout “balls” at 9pm.
20:45 Work work Angelica work work Eliza and Peggy  21:46 I shouldn’t brag but dang
1:25 mike jack
This is soo funny, im subcribing
Dude that lighting struck at the perfect time
"Male chickens don't lay eggs" famous last words
E
Don't worry I got my black hole license
They went back to survival 😂
What is going on
lol can i just say, im 13 and i understood all of those references
I have a theory about the lore  Philza would be the only one left alive: -Tommy would be stabbed because someone found him too annoying -Philza is going to kill wilbur... again -Slimecicle is actually gonna get sucked by a black hole
i dont like the dsmp but im binge watching the mod videos
milked
Video idea tommyinit is the black hole and can move grow and shrink
He said we are almost to 7m subs uh yea I thing we are a bit over 7m subs
i see that wilbur love black holes and space stuff as he knows about the event horizon and the fact that a black hole is a small infinite particle

Tommy why is it in every video you somehow get sucked in some way 🤨🤨🤔🤔
1. 3:13 *one is a kid* 2. 5:33 I remember a few people calling him the anti-christ for helping blind people and one of the arguments was that he got “beast” in the name(? 3. 6:30 Tommy and Charlie are both the less and most believable bullies at the same time, because how they seem to look but Tommy with the “very funny“ to catastrophic situations seems like a psychopath and Charlie is buff enough to bully even the parents 4. 16:27 “ignorance is bliss” 45. 21:47 that was so cinematically close xd
Tommy: I was looking for some good mud to eat and I found something disturbing  Others: shut up Tommy
20:05 that timing though⚡️
*me checking sub button as video begins*
20:04 I don't think enough people are talking about this It's metal as shit
20:10 Mine is the Good Platinum Machine Gun Jetpack
The video just turned into halo reach at the end Objective Survive
After the war,I went back to New york Af-After the war,I went back to new york I finished up my studies and i practised law I practised law,Burr worked next door Even though they started at the very same  Alexander Hamilton began to climb
The fact they were singing Hamilton 😭🖐
Fun Fact: Gargantua, the Blackhole from interstellar doesn’t look like both M87 and Me because of its perspective.  With the perspective of Gargantua’s accretion disc, it looks like it does because the light is warping around it, so yes, Blackholes can look like that.
Hey philza you where in creative I saw it I chat at around 7 minutes 30
20:24 this was the best minutes of my life
Wilbur is going for the Master league i CR bro
He spotted it with his ears
the woffle house has fond its new host
I was jumpscared by the persona music in the middle of the video lol
bro using commands to see were is the fortress 14:24
✨Goushay✨
I am  15
how is wilbur 4-5 meters
0:07 what the
He actually thought he won 😂
Wilbur and Slimecicle: *Tries to run from the Blackhole*  Blackhole: "Get back in your *cage* monkey"
Can we all agree that when tommy looks at the blackhole in darkness when it was raining and the thunder makes the blackhole visible was actually menacing
Me after taco bell
7 milion? now it's 12 milion
HELP IM GAY AND AN AGE REGRESSOR AND MY CLASSMATE FOUND MY TIKTOK, THIS IS A TIME SENSITIVE QUESTION, WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO
13:07 dam that jumped me so hard i hit my hand on the table hard just as reflex..
10:08 [gamemode was set to survival]
Call me insane but, I never understood why everyone hates the falling sensation in dreams, for me it’s a calming experience and I try to replicate it every night while trying to fall asleep…
OH OK
7M?

Bamnationem latine
21:16  So, no one gonna talk about this? Wilbur and Slimecicle: *singing Tiktok* Wilbur: Oh Ch- Charlie, C- Charlie CHARLIE CHARLIE Slimecicle: *gets sucked in* Wilbur: DON'T STO-
I love how every video that Wilbur is in with crazy mods, he’s always trying to do the most insane shit with said crazy mod. It’s basically his thing at this point
The fact that only phil and tommy didn't get suck by the hole at all and beat the game. I would never can do that💀
Mmrrbbeeaasstt
“What REFRENCE would Tommys audience Not get?” Me:  *singing legit every song with them*
wilbur; all of tommy's fans are 14 me: IM EIGHT
Do you think he smokes to- *wilbur?* GOT ME
20:06 the lightning illuminating the black hole was some horror movie type shit
I mis-clicked on the video but I really enjoyed it still
This is the first tommyinnit video I ever saw. And to be honest. I hated him when I first saw him. Just like he always says in his intro. Now I watch all his videos 😎
7.4k dislikes
charlie: he he im goin in the blackhole
2:47 to 2:54 eeee! No cus word
philza: plays the game and actually helps Tommy: being Tommy slime: doctor? spagettified? Dr. Cicle? we dont know  Wilbur: has seen the stars. and. so. much. more. then. we. could. ever. know.
Me being eleven 20:28
Wilbur's seen some things in there
Mr beast see’s this video and he just goes like: wtf guys 😂😂😂
have you installed tinder now you got 11 million subscribers
Phil: Pro gamer and survivor Tommy: Child in a bad situation Slime: over-dosed druggy scientist Wilbur: Seen some black hole phenomena. This is the video I subscribed to Tommy. :)
Idk why Wilbur thinks that when one generation comes along, they just live under a rock 💀
heyyy, omg thx for the likes, bitch
7:07 Fun Fact: if you turn around the the sentence that Wilbur said in latin, it translates to: "Damnation in Latin, this is true latin."
Bri’ish kids…
20:46 got that reference.
I think Wilbur's black hole experience changed him
some are ten like me. :) WHY AM I SO YOUNG??
Thats a wrong depiction of a black hole
When Tommy said we are close to 7– My audio got to Bluetooth so I had to take it off and the he said —subscribers   Go Tommy get your 7 subs 😂😂😂
In 15:10 its like an ARG all over again.
Finally, a Tommyinnit video where he does not mention that "he's annoying". Guess that's the power of being close to 7M subs!
Tommyinnit set philsa mincraft to createive
How did he get 5m subs in 1 year
I just love how philza was the only productive person playing unlike the rest
HE SAID MY NAME
14:10 yea thats the right caption
tommy: you can unsubscribe anytime also tommy: theres a glitch that makes people unsubscribe
5:25 5:32 this aged like fine whine.
japaidaraaisamafoaneisdatida
M.U.L.E
charlie having a doctorate in partical physics is my favorite bit ever
Tommy, Wilbur,  Slime: being hectic.   Phil:  being absolutely normal.
"What's your guys favorite jetpack joyride jetpack 💀 "
19:59 HOLY SHIT THAT WAS A BADASS SHOT-
4k 7:51
I just noticed Phil has a wiggler shirt, monster Hunter pog
1:22 bro turned into Michael Jackson
Why did Charlie look like jerma so much?
Wilbur is amazing when he’s doing bits
Tommyinnit changed philza’s gamemode to creative?
Man the black hole do be good at succ though
14:25 dont look in chat...
Best Tommyinnit era
Some are 9😅
This with the voice chat mod would be funny
CLEMENTINE AGAIN OMG TOMMY YOU NEED TO GET A F ING MOTH
18:35 philza has the persona 5 music
The Waffle House has found it’s new host
Every single one of these videos has the same alternate title: Tommy and the boys mess around while Philza speed runs the game.
it SUUCCKKKKKKK
There are just 2 Minecrafters and then they got the 2 insane people calling themselves scientists
at 20:40 I can hear botanic panic from cuphead that’s cool
i enjoyed watching tommy's black hole
Wilbur said hoc est verum latine bamnationem latine, which means This is the true latin wording of latin
0:56 wrong colour lol
20:07 *Lightning flashes*  Black Hole: Hello there.
Tommyinnit: wilbur shout  terrible words at him Wilbur: AH! Swears😂😂😂 22:09 22:10  *Tommy laughs* Tommyinnit: no no no😂😂😂
Charlie: i dont- i gotta Woah ah  awwshjsj😂😂😂  17:58 *Tommy, and wilbur starts to laugh*
14:24  "The nearest fortress is at [-320 (and random numbers that I can't see)]"  Was I the only one who saw that??
Wilbur: "what's the most obscure reference we can make that Tommy's fans will not understand?"  Me: Get's every reference and doesn't understand how it's supposed to be remotely obscure.  Also me: Realizes I'm old.
the latin or whatever language at 7:07 is mirrored and translates to "damnation in latin" and "truth in latin" or something along the lines of that i think
That Singing at the end was fucking amazing!!! 🤣🤣🤣
need more tommy and slime vids!!!
filza giving up on beating the game going in creative
Wilbur:Taste of your lips I'm on a ride~  Me:Your toxic I'm sippin on your        taste of a poison paradise!!
bro wilbur is fucking kratos my guy died 16 times and came back
Erm I'm 8 yrs
this is my fav video only bc of the im going in a black hole
HEE HEE
Wilbur:what-  Tommy:wibur?
20:04 favourite moment
1:25 micheal jack 3 seconds later than the other
1:22 heehee
Even here Wilbur became Ghostbur
Bro Charlie actually sounds like Micheal Jackson
Toxic guns slipping unda😊
Dr cicle come with me I’m not cming back the way he said that
Imagine activating that mod on one of your old seeds and it destroys a house you made in the past
I don’t know if it’s a bit or if he just does it but the Wilbur going insane for a portion of every video he’s in is hilarious
*tasty mud* ✨
Why was philza in creative mode at that one scene
Wilbur and Charlie are the perfect duo
4:52, the colors of text of wilbur and charlie switched for some reason lol
I love how everyone is just joking around, and there’s just Phil’s beating the game
“Im’a going in a black hole!” Killed me, great vid.
Im 8 years old
It’s pulling the snow from above my feet-tommyinnit
jump in the cadillac
20:06 21:05
Them making references tommyinit fans won't understand Me was educated: I AINT COMING BACK!
all im saying is i recognized half the things will and charlie were talking about. does that make me old or them young?
if you just stay in the nether you'll be fine lol
ah good ol wilbur getting possesed!
This video will be funnier if big Q was on there
14:10  why does "OHh, guy im so long." get subtitled as "IF i get sucked in,"?
tommy: my blood pressure is dropping also tommy: the real phd in this video
Actually, I understood "I wanna go to Kings college" ALEXANDER HAMILTON
I'll never stop laughing at "Wil, what's heaven like?"  "It's red and hot"
what mod is this
Jesus loves you ❤️
10:30 SOME breaking bad vibes
3:33 Pl1lza I didn’t expect this out of you but it’s okay❤
More Than 7 mil subs
Bro you have 11,8 subs
hoc est verum latin
bamnationem latin
Willbur: “having an existential crisis”  Tommy: wanna shoot hoops?
It’s wil trying to establish a story, Phil being a god, and Tommy n slime being Tommy n slime.
People that knows every song Wilbur and Charlie were singing gang  👇
I’m drinking…SPARKLING WATER I SWEAR
Jump
I think philza is still good at hardcore because Tommy is constantly Putting him in situations that are harder than Hardcore
Soooooo, I have accidentally thought up lore:  Wilbur and Charlie used to be scientists. Wilbur overworked and Charlie was lazy at his work, causing Wilbur to do most of the work and Charlie relaxing and leaving a lot. One day though, Wilbur had created a ‘alive’ black goop but when Charlie left for awhile, The goop and  Wilbur’s computer combined, connecting Wilbur to it too. When Charlie came back with guests, Philza and Tommy, they got stuck too.   (Also, The order of who got voided)  1. Wilbur  2.Charlie  3.Tommy   4.Philza
Wish I had it; it's awesome!
A-HOLE MOD!!! YEY!!!!
7:53 chat: Tommyinnit seted philza game mode to Creative mode....Me:it doesnt matter philza is dead alive or cheating, i would use creative either
Wait, If mrbeast is the ruler of hell.      Then that means that morgz is the ruler of heaven
WHY ARE CHARLIE'S SUBTITLES PURPLE AT 1:00 THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE
By the way, the backwards writing said: damnationem latine, hoc est verum latine. “This is the truth of the damnation”
Tommy, Charlie, Wilbur and Philza are the best team
I ate a dirt it got in my mouth while my classmates clean outside
wilbur, slimecicle, and tommy trying to escape peacfully Philza: 18:35
wilbur and slimecicle singing TiK ToK by Kesha is something i did not know i needed
I like how I go every reference will and smile made to song and I'm 13 lol
This + portal mode
“Aw I’m so long” Cc: IF I GET SUCKED IN
I am 10
Them: what's something Tommy's fans wont understand bc they ar like 14  Me: ur bad this I'm not even 14 and I know those songs....
7:04 in the end mrbeast changed it to 1 billion orbez and dropping a car on it instead xD
fr
6M to 11M
some are nine
sorry what COLOR is the hole?
Is it weird when ever I have a headache i watch Tommy ?
How do you say “Yes, you look good” in Spanish? Tommy: Si… See Deez Nuts!
Tommy: is it clementine? Me: TWD TWD TWD
I'm under 14 and got ALL of the references.
I love that Charlies last words were "Imma get a scholarship to kings college"
Science and discovery amiright
half of this video was 3 idiots calling Mr Beast God and Phil being responsible
When Charlie says HEE-HEE before he died in the black hole was gold.
19:40
wilbur im 13 and i understood all of those phrases😂😂
11:11 you're a fool,
I love that Will, Charlie, and Tommy are just screwing around while Phil is actually trying to play the game.
7:06 If you put it in front of a mirror it says in Latin *damnationem latine hoc est verum latine* which translates to this in English  *”damnation" in Latin is "truth" in Latin* But take out the word *latine* and you get this in English *This is the truth of damnation*
22:05 Charlie cheated
phillza: *DU DU DU DU*
18:17 how does that make me laugh? (Well, according to comedy I guess)
till this day we dont know what wlbur wanted to say to charlie
Wilbur: I call it the c@$k hole. Slimecicle: It’s great that you call it that. Had me crying lol
7:08 translating with advanced tool called google translate (I'm so smart)  _banmation in Latin_ _this is true in Latin_
I just realized he almost sounds like Harry Potter but not really, but not because of his British accent. His voice is almost similar to Harry Potter's voice for some moments
1:20
Wilbur: *gets sucked into black hole* Me: ok.. Wilbur: *voice changer* Me: *sigh..* here we go again.  Wilbur: *starts a whole fucking wise thing speech* Me: yep it's another insane arc.
Will, Charlie, Tommy: Dumb, Dumber, Dumbest.  Phil: actually playing the game
Charlie’s last words ehhe 💀
Tommy: Some of my audience is 16 Me: I'm frickin 12 and i'm more mature than Tommy
I'm SO GLAD Tommy turned around and just looked at Charlie when he said "let's row with it"
8:44 he got long and then he was gone. He went wide and then he died. 14:44 *IN HERE PUBERTY NEVER ENDS*
I love how like 2 minutes in, it's already just complete chaos
I see Tommy innit I cry  I see sl8mecicle  FUCK YES
TommyInit: WHY ARE YOU GUYS NOT STRESSED?! Philza:*Speedrunning*
They all think we’re 14 and Dotn watch old films I’m 12 and I know old references
I’ve looked deeper into the black abyss…   But when it looked back at me…     I blinked.
The fact that Philza got the 'Free the end' achievement is just hilarious.
E
5:33 I think we found him
the black holes name is Sagittarius A
Black Hole be like your going to Brazil
-1241 68 2273
Good old times :)
20:06 It's like at the beginning of that godzilla movie where they couldn't see it and lightning flashed and then they could
WHAT IS THAT MELODcY
1:22 best death ever
*Phizas mind:*DU DU DU DU
Ngl. Charlie’s if “if I get sucked in then what I don’t know-“ would be really powerful emotional scene in like… an actual book. Like, imagine they’ve just had this big fight one of them dies like everything in here. It could be very sad. Very emotional and set up trauma for the main character.
I love how supportive Phil was at the end with Tommy
dude... im 13 and even i know the songs Toxic and Tik tok.... im talkin .... PEDICURE ON MY TOES TOES
Why does he always use cuphead music
I understood all those refrences and im 13
Charlie said the great omelet of the beyond Pov me : you think your the mother of all omelets here Charlie can bred over any eggs
21:49 clutched
21:45 shesh
19:32 he actually wtf
1:46 very funny cuz im back for round 2 of the vid
I'm sending ovre A turbo AYE
I love tommy
Before Wilber threw the egg you can see Phil gets creative
…AND IT WAS HILARIOUS!
Bro I’m born in 2008 and I knew all those songs
20:05 top ten epic anime moments
I’m not sure even quackity could’ve made this more chaotic
2:34 TOMMY’S RACIST?!?!?!??!
Wilbur and Charlie think that I don’t know the references but I know all
19:00
Let's talk about mental health -tommy
Best moments(in my opinion) and things I wanted to point out  He's goin' in a black hole 1:25 Why did their text colors swap- 4:46 That's a valid point- oh he's dead 5:02 Ah yes- "damnation latine" and "hoc est verum latine" 😃 7:08 Wait- what 8:44
I’ve loved your videos
5:31 TOMMY CHEATED AND PUT CREATIVE MODE!!
I always have to timestamp at least one thing 1:22
7:12 For those wondering what the actual translation is, it's: "damnation" in Latin is "truth" in Latin".
I wanna see this video but only Philza's screen
Philza: The father in each video Wibursoot: the insane one who kills everyone and needs therapy Slimecicle: The one who joins Wilbursoot in a quest to find death (sometimes) Tommyinit: The only one who's a child
Any one notice Charlie change his game mode back to survival
Charlie's "just row with it" was so sad. I get it Charlie
“There all 14” me and everyone else “how did u know…?”
All of the references that 14 18-year-olds shouldn't have known a 12-year-old know
Hehe FUCKEN DIES
Why is Mr Beast literally Satan 😂😂😂
I’m 11
i love that the black hole looks like a giant shadow when lightning appears
14:10 I like how everyone missed this one editing mistake, could just be my phone bugging but E
Chat: tommyinnit in survivel mode!?
7 million? shit he's gained almost 5 million in a year jesus...
Latin says “ Damnation Latin. This is truly latin”
“Wilbur..?” * dies * “PFFT”
I love how Charlie takes Wilbur’s colour for a sec
philza the only one doing work
I find it funny that at 14:10 there's an editing error with the captions for charlie
7:07 when wilbur quotes mrbeast the subtitle translates to "damnation in latin, This is true in Latin" which is a cool easter egg
"All of tommyinnits fans were born in 2006"  *proceeds to sing 2 songs made after 2006*
bro my name is Eliza and i got scared when charlie said it😅
it's funny wilbur and charlie implying kids awareness of the world stops before their birth
congrats on 11.m
Did anyone else notice tommy set philzas mode to creative when Charlie and wilbur were doing their egg bit??
The "IF I get sucked in, THEN WHAT?! I DON'T KNO-" moment was legitimately kind of bone chilling
Close to 7 million- That aged well
Lmfao
Ahhhh abit welp happy Halloween 🎃
Ahhhh hait
Did he hit you with the 1 million dollar golden whip? Got me laughing insanely hard
Tommy-theyre not all 14 there are 16 and 18. Me- uh oh
charlies puns are too much XD
Loving how I got most of the references they made and I'm not even fifteen
How worrying is it that I’m 12 and get all these references
👋
I was born 2005
You gotta go now don’t die please
It's black ball
Love that Wilbur and Charlie sang two Hamilton songs 🤩
1:24
charlie: OooOoH gUYs Im sO lOng the subtitles: IF i get sucked in (x3) 14:08
Shut up, I got all of the reference. Prick.
Tommy just cheating looking for a nether fortress in 14:24
technoblade works for the blood god
do you hate dream if yyou do I hate you for not being on the side of evil on the dream amp
Bruh
And they say atleast 14 16 and 18
Bruh I like 10
Okay so the captions written in latin read "Damnationem Latine Hoc Est Verum Latine" as someone who knows latin slightly, this roughly translates to '"damnation" in latin is "truth" in latin"'
Tommy:I can’t see the Barack hole Lighting:oh I gotchu bro Tommy:AAAAAAA
I wish i had that mod my friend XD
This is a bucket
It's kinda funny how they are blatantly cheating the entire time
I love how seahr he afterr the fortrees
Love u ❤❤❤❤❤❤😮😮😮😮😮😮😂😂😂😂
I love that when Wilbur and Slmccl make fun of Tommy’s fans for not knowing old pop songs(of which I knew all of them), he then plays one last effort from Halo 3, which came out in 2007
7:55 did anyone see the creative mode?
They were talking about clash of clans but were playing clash royale
casually sees the "set philzas game mode to creative"
the Michael Jackson part got me beginning 1:20 ending 1:28
Some are 13
Charlie singing Hamilton has made my day.
Charlie just casually singing Hamilton at the end is ✨EVERYTHING✨
are we gonna talk about how charley made a good Micheal Jackson?
I AINT COMING BACK PEEDICURE ON MY TOES WILBUR SYAS
[WilburSoot:Set own game mode to Creative Mode]21:24

21:11
At 19:42 I was practically saying, "Wilbur! remember the 'if then' statement!! Come on for science!!!!"
21:21
Mr beast didn't want to give them mercy my friends
Is this the first time they finished a speedrunn!?!????
Fun fact: they cheating but still funny

Rip the queen of England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Wilbur, Tommy and Slime having a moment:  meanwhile Philza: *speedrunning*
basically tommy being very stressed out is what I never saw.
XD lol jajaja 😁
Me being 10 “YOUR TOXIC-“
The best part is I’m a pretty young watcher but I got ALLLLLLL the references 👌😘  Jetpack joyride is supreme tho  Hamilton thoooo 😃✌️
The way   thay  where like      where like where is it ?* Tunder  flashis  *  like a horror moveie
Im actually younger than tommy and i understood everything that Charlie and Wilbur said we wouldnt 😂😂😂
Heheh... Dr Phil...                      Dr Philza.
0:57 why did Charlie have Wilbur’s text color??
"I called to the stars and they laughed at me" is such a visceral and raw line-
This was actually the first tommyinnit video i watched
Tommy and Charlie - trying to get to Phil before the black hole eats them -  Phil - trying to beat the game -  Wilbur - playing Clash of Clans -
You can just see in the chat that they are trying to hide going into creative 😂
“Wuh?”   *”Wilbur?”*
I love how Phil only died once while wilbur, charlie, and tommy kept dying
Not even a minute into the video and he already swears 😂😂😂
How is Charlie so funny? It is not humanly possible to be that funny…
i love how the groups personalities vary there’s tommyinnit loud, energetic, and chaotic slimecicle making puns constantly and being chaotic wilbur being sinister and dramatic and philza just hyper focusing on the game while everyone else just messes around
In every vid Wilbur goes insane
Tommy and philza: want to win/live   Charlie and Wilbur: *SINGING*
Philza: actually working Tommy: being a cracked child Wilbur: *discovering the secrets of life and reality* Slimecicle: BILL NY- i mean uhhh... DR. SLIME THE SCIENCE GUY
I'm 14 rn and I understood most of wilbur's and charlie's thing, maybe 1 I didn't understand
KILL MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. (Sub to me or no free happy meals)
20:05 when the lightning illuminated the black hole it was really ominous
I knew some of the songs Charlie and Wilbur were singing
4:02 why’d you phrase it like that, Thomas
Love how wuilber ,Charlie , and  Tommy are trying to run from a dark Black hole and there just phil is just having the time of this love trying to kill blaze
14:09 EDITOR MADE A TEXT MISTAKE
Will: speaks about what the afterlife is like in a soft, sad tone. Tommy and Charles: hey you want some drugs
“It’s the great omelette of the beyond!!”    Gotta be one of my favorite lines
Charlie is so good at doing little bits and starting cults
22:08 "Ahhhhhh!! C***. W***" is so funny oml
Yes Philza ALWAYS PRAY TO MR BEAST PHILZA ALWAYS PRAY TO MR BEAST !!!
(Charley)hehe AAAAAAAHHHHHH
also the subtitles when wilbur translates mr beast say damnation in latin this is true in latin  its just backwards latin
I see Tommy likes halo
7:54 bottom left.
damnationem latine  hoc est vernum latine
7:49 it says Philza gamemode set to creative
I’m 13 and I get all of those references lol
🦭❤️🐟
21:50 I skipped a heartbeat a second ago I thought they are not gonna make it but R.I.P to Charlie
It’s Clementine twat waffles
Im 12 and i know all the references
Isn’t this technically a black sphere instead of a black hole?
Tommy Wilbur and Charlie: in boats  Phil:* intensely trading and killing* FVCK YH!
I wanted to see Tubbo's reaction to the black hole
Why wasn't Tubbo in the video
Wow good job you have 11m subs
ITS THE BLACK MOON
stop saying the f w
I just like how the subtitles don’t even correct tommy.  (20:57)
Wilbur said "damnation" in Latin is "vurem" in Latin
Terrence is actually a good name for a black hole
5:48 mhm
Maybe some are 11 like me
Just build up dummies
YOU SAID MY NAME- CLEMENTINE HWBFYSNEJDUSUWNDJXUUSHENDSIEUDNJDSUEJJDJE
when wilbur sang the beginning of stronger 😂
1:25 charlie Becomes Michael Jackson "i'ma going in a black hole"
4:07 I love that buy now he did all of those things
>:3
Wait tommy sad obsidian is the strongest block in game...did he forget about bedrock because you can brake obsidian but you can't brake bedrock!
MrBeast free promotion
the halo music
I can understand most of the references that were made
Is it just me or should Charlie be a lead singer in the idiot boi’s-😂
at 7:08 Wilbur said This is the true Latin banning in Latin in Latin backwards
x
Does anybody realize the subtitles bounced and repeated at one point 😀
2:36 when he said he did not like black holes lol😂😂😂🤣🤣
DISGUSTING🦠🦠🦠🦠🦠🦠🦠🦠🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢😵🤢😵🤢🤢😵🤢😵🤢😵🤢😵🤢😵🤢🤢🤢🤢😵🤢😵🤢😵🤢🤓😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡

can you guys do wither storm mod?
20:05 movie material
I know all the references Charlie and Will said and I’m 11 hehehehehehehehee
imma going in a black hole XD omg Charlie is halarious
This was interesting
Seeing the black hole when the lightning strikes is terrifying because the sky is just pitch black at night so you can’t see it
I was born 2008 and I knew all of the songs Wilbur and Charlie were singing
wow i love interstellar
Wait did slimecicle just go on creative
If i saw herobrine i would call my friend kevin
Ayo Tommy just set Phil's gamemode into creative in 7:53
Ohhhhh so that’s where my dad went!
this video is good but i think they should play cracker wither storm mod
philza was too good
Meanwhile Philza speedruning the game
That escape from the overworld was sick
Wear did wilbur get the obsidian and rails
Tommy: I’m gonna get ten million subs and tinder   Him now: having 11 million
Damnationem latine hoc est verum Latine
Wilber: "There 14"   Tommy: " no some are 16 and 18"   All sings older but really good songs  Me: uhm I'm 12 wait is that toxic wait now is that party in the house or sumthin  Sings along cuz I know them all
Tommy and Phil: actually playing  Slime and will: becoming bill Nye

Nothing but jokes and inspirational advice EDIT: I love the meows of sucking the bark off trees 😋
slimcicle has obtained the purple text at 0:55
He’s come so far!
One of the music when they went out of the nether I recognise is from just cause 3
This entire video is just Phil babysitting
“i called to the stars and they laughed at me” jesus
14:12 I love how it keeps saying If I get sucked in while he's saying a different line
Tommy: we are close to 7 million subs Me: looks down and sees 11.8 million me: that looks about right
He said he will go on tinder and he did
Inertia is a property of matter that causes it to resist changes in velocity (speed and/or direction). According to Newton's first law of motion, an object with a given velocity maintains that velocity unless acted on by an external force. Inertia is the property of matter that makes this law hold true.
Tommy and Charlie: *freaking out* Wilbur:*plays games on phone*
When your not 14,16, or 18
What arena are you in Wilbur?
20:05, the lightning and Tommy’s girly scream make it seem like a horror movie, when it’s like dark in the forest and the lightning reveals a serial killer or a monster or something
7:09 I plugged this into google translate and the text means “‘damnation’ in latin means ‘truth’ in latin”
philza does everything lol 🤣
it would be so cool if they added some sort of time dialation if your far away from the black hole the debris nearer to the black hole starts to move slower until you get closer to the even hosrizon
Philza: needs therapy because of the children  Charlie: doesn't care about the void in the start but regrets  Wilbur: being friends with animals  Tommy: freaking out about the void
That laugh is golden i swear
i feel like they should have invited quackty  to this mod
Tommy: i cant even see iAAAAAAAAAAAAHH
Ah see ya! *Dies* *Cow sounds*
1:19 I can't stop replaying this bit XD
THIS IS SO FAKE
Wilbur and Charlie singing Tik tok by Kesha Is my life now
if this vid didnt have quackity in it its not good
What is it with slimecicle and being Michael Jackson???
Get tommy to 12 million
THIS IS THE MOST GUCKING FUNNIEST VIDEO IVE VER SEEN AHAHHAHAAHH
This was intense
did you know not even the speed of light can escape a black hole so they're screwed
Damn Brits
Charlie: oh I’m so long *subtitles* IF I get sucked in,

Experience my big, black hole
The way it approaches wilbur and charlie so fast it so fuckin scary 💀
When your 13 and watch him😏
11:52 - 12:52 I think nobody talks about how intense this scene really was, like that was some A-class improv right there!   13:13 - 13:54 Like the genuine delivery of this is just unironically good
just to let @wilbur to know i know every song he sang
hee hee
Need Wilbur death counter
14:11 I think editor Larry made a mistake
5:31 also very sus chat
1:54 hmmmm chat lookin a little sus there 🤨
21:47 lore
Wilbur acted like blopwobble.
Hey, man, my dog passed away recently and you and your channel have been helping me out, so I just wanted to thank you for making these videos
slimecicle: Michel Jackson  2.0 HEHE
FYI Wilbur I'm 15 and knew all but 1 of those songq

21:29 Well placed halo music tommy Edit: finish the fight, that’s the song
I am 9
Hmmm... This seems familiar

7:08 damnationem latine, hoc est verum latine
Ph1LzA: ‘playing the game’ Everyone else: *MRBEAST’S BLACK HOLE IS SO HOT AND JUICY*

You know, some of us are younger that 14 here...
14:23 tommy gets the cords for three fortress.

I'm 11

This show is so f*cking hilarious
I know all the references and I’m 13
Is nobody gonna talk about the fact that Wilbur and Charlie SUNG HAMILTON YEEEEAAAAH
hey, other people see you becoming red and dissapearing when you go into a black hole, and what you see is your final moments before you turn into nothingness
0:55 Editing Error: Charlie’s subtitles used Wilbur’s colors
wilbur and charlie act like we don't know the songs but we do
when they started making references at 20:25 saying Tommy's viewers wouldn't understand, I understood every reference XD being 16 is snazzy.
Tommy keep up the good work you are the peak of comedy in my opinion keep it up
10:07 Wilbur literally went in creative mode to get back to tommy. and get the things for his experiments.
Tommyinmit kept his promise, as once he got 10 million subs, he made a video, THAT IMCLUDED TINDER DATING BRO LES GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
They started singing a song that is older than be by Katy perry DONT STOP MAKING OPO DJ'S GOING ??? TONIGHT OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OHHH OH OH OH
Im surprised they didn't mention a "that's what she said" joke
I love Charlie and Phil's energy at the beginning so goddamn much
I've won but at what cost?
18:27 Charlie’s inner Gillion Tidestrider, , Champion of the Undersea, Hero of the Deep, The One, Singer/Songwriter of Gillion and the Tidestriders hit single "Hole in Your Heart", Pigeon Lord, Moisture Master, Horse Tamer, Defenestrator of the Adulterous, Friend of Dugan, Walking Fish, Fish, Dirt Eater, Chum of Chibo and Chums, Co-Captain of the Riptide Pirates, Co-captain of the Albatross, Companion of Pretzel, Paramount Champion, Knighter of Julian That One Time, Serpent Rider, Friend of Duke D Dukem Duke of Duke, Eater of Grass, Beater of Ass, Capitalism Hater, Royalty Assassinator, Sufferer of the Spice, Weed Eater, Slayer of Evil, Loffinlot Liberator, Fruitninja, Eater of Sand, Co-Captain Gil of the Riptide Pirates, Juice Enjoyer." came out

tommy  wilbur and charlie  getting away from the black whole  philza:i minght get more ender peals 16  gose t okill blazes  he just playes mc
.
You can tell how hard Charlie and Tommy were trying to lighten the mood Wilbur was casting
‘Dragon! Your a bitch! And you’ve got no fans!’ No I’m her fan but the bitch part is correct
Charlie and Wilbur: *singing*  Me: bold of you guys to think I'm 14,16, or 18 and thinking I don't listen to old music 😃
bfb 1
Not Wilbur saying "this sentence is true" in Latin
9:45 who was the girl who said what
14:44 “IN HERE, PUBERTY NEVER ENDS” 💀
1:25 Charlie’s Michael Jackson bit
I got all of the references and I was born in 2007, I know it's a joke but a lot of people now a days have no faith in our generation.
0:23
4:59  before i go i have something i want to say to you..      male chickens don't lay eggs. why were you calling it a *hEeeEEeeee*...   ༼ ༎ຶ ෴ ༎ຶ༽ rip chicken bro. you will be missed.
Bro I actually love how you put the Halo music at the end
WHO AGREES THAT TOMMY DESERVES ALL THESE SUBS
I'm Eleven Not Fourteen
Within the black hole there is Dr Phil
7:07 translation  Sentence in Latin that is true in Latin. 🙂👍
19:23 i love how Wilbur is just like "i won" so innocent
18:26 what is the name of the music
wil tom slime :in boats playing  phil: beating the game
Why would you reference Hamilton. Even I, a 12-year-old, understand hamilton.
tommy clearly doesnt know how black holes work they dont grow that fast and they pull in from way longer. when it was tiny it would make you into string cheese but when its big, it just pulls you in entirely. Also, when you approach a black hole you would actually see the back of your head as the light reflecting off the black hole would be pulled towards and around the black hole .
14:10  "IF i get sucked in," "IF i get sucked in," "IF i get sucked in," Slimecicle: ohhhh.. guys im so long...
17:55 probably my favorite part
Where did you guys meet, in game/or?
Wilbur sounds like he’s in his arg
Ha I liked the halo song at the end  and en the begining
I love how Phil is actually beating the game while tommy wilbur and charlie just die over and over
Cum
16 18 wait oh no i am 8 i am getting sucked in the philza vids and wilbur
Philza - actually trying to win - Tommy, Wilbur, and Charlie “Let’s crash into the ice berg for romance and drama!”
How dare you. I know all those references.
4:12 He actually did it.
They got killed by the black hole 14 times.. I think.. I was dared to find out how many
"okay, maybe tommy is a bit funny i might subscri-" ive been doin unhealthy binges straight watching no food
The funniest part was "he he AH OH OH"
philza just beating the dman game while the 3 others are just dying
20:05 that was menacing
Im going in a black hole 1:23
the entire video was just wilbur and charlie lore
The way I found you is weird I making some doodles brushing of the eraser shavings and I accidentally clicked this vid
the best laugh of all time 4:58
baBAsdSIADd
Slimecicle has been killed by black hole
14:12 wrong text

And I love what you do Don't you know that you're toxic? It's getting late to give you up I took a sip from my devil's cup Slowly, it's taking over me Too high, can't come down It's in the air and it's all around Can you feel me now? With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride You're toxic, I'm slippin' under With a taste of a poison paradise I'm addicted to you Don't you know that you're toxic? And I love what you do Don't you know that you're toxic? Don't you know that you're toxic? Taste of your lips, I'm on a ride You're toxic, I'm slippin' under With a taste of a poison paradise I'm addicted to you Don't you know that you're toxic? With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride You're toxic, I'm slippin' under (toxic) With a taste of a poison paradise I'm addicted to you Don't you know that you're toxic? Intoxicate me now, with your lovin' now I think I'm ready now, I think I'm ready now Intoxicate me now, with your lovin' now I think I'm ready now

You wouldn't die if you got sucked in, to you you would just stay at a certain distance for near eternity, for spectator's you would be sucked in instantly

1:25 best  moment
20:35 *Laughs on 12 and being raised on these*
why dont they just escape to the nether, lava pool speedrun portal, break when your there, and follow lukethenotable's step-by-step guide to surviving

Jokes on you I listen to older music

Cum
Are going to talk about how Wilbur switched to creative
3:31 BOO 5:00 wise words... 5:57 shoot some hoops 19:32 turn around
Is no one going to ask that all the chickens are female?
That dumb little child annoys me.
4:50 the subtitles switch colours for a moment
The halo music
Did anyone see in chat of the video that ph1LzA went into creative mode?
Black holes have a single point in space and is (Theoretically) infinitely dense.
I don't even care the first minute and 15 seconds is the funniest part of the whole thing
Rip techno
Slimcicle and wilbur do magic bro
RIP TECHNO
RIP Technoblade
tip: go to newest first to see all of the children who commented on the video
Is it weird that I was born in 2009 and I still understand all the references Wilbur was saying?
Wilbur just playing Clash Royale next to a GIANT Black Hole XD
Technoblade the legendary bedwars player

Wilbur:the black hole is inside my body Me:“ah,ah,help me, he inside my body,ah,help,I won't come back. Phantasm sonic with lyrics”

14:10 editor moment

Poor Charlie is traumatized

Why do say a sware word?! B*tch,f*ck, and everything
At 0:55 Charlie’s text turns purple
21:01 how is it that I’m 16 and I got every single reference? Either my mom has influenced my choice in music too much, or they’re just really bad at trying to confuse Tommy’s viewers XD
I love how I am literally the age of Tommy's viewers that Wilbur and Slime were trying confuse but I still understood every reference they made
The only thing on tommy's search history:how thick is schlatt's facial hair?
Hi
No we didn't donate enough money to team trees.
i love that i got all the references and im 13 LMAO 🤣
Fricken Wilbur soot going crazy in all of Tommy’s videos. (Also, who’s watching this in 2022?)
Charli just HeHed to death 🤣😂😂
Basically the thumbnail:   🤣 🏃🏼⚫️
Praying people don’t play Just Cause 3 and go “Omg it’s the music from that TommyInnit video!”
This would have been more entertaining without screaming kids.
I was born in 2009 and I know most the songs will and Charlie was singing
Yes Philza, you didn’t pray hard enough to the lord of hell apparently
In every one of those videos Philza is too powerful for us, he probably met MrBeast
13:08 monkey mode activated
Willbur is obssessed at the black hole
It is not really kid friendly with all the swearing 😕
7:54   In chat “Tommyinnit has set philzas game mode to creative”   Not hating just found it suspicious 🤨
THE SKYLAR SISTERS
i likee how in all of these will just becomes a cultist who worships the void
(127) get rickrolled lol - YouTube this is fake trust me
17:26 will power from persona 5
im younger than 14 and i understood the hamilton reference
I dreamed of a black hole and a was shocked!
I want a white hole mod! ;)
4:10 "I'm going to get 10 million subscribers and I'm going to download tinder, Illegally!"  *sighs*, We all know where this went a year later now
Somebody spell icup
Nothings better than Charlie’s Michael Jackson impressions 1:25
Its my birthday!
AMENNNN!!!!!!!!
Black holes aren’t actually black they’re white purple and blue
Mr. Best wow 😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏
A year later hey there’s mud now Tommy
Every mod video be like: Wilbur: Seeing things and being crazy. Tommy: Screaming and trying to find Phil. Phil: Trying to grind and beat the game. Charlie: Messing about and throwing one-liners about.
"at 10 mil subs ill install tinder illegally" Tommy now: I INSTALLED TINDER AND THANKS FOR 11 MIL SUBS
Just watched this after the Tinder video and he just said 'gonna get 10mil and get tinder' which he in fact did
Well I guess he did get tinder
Golden b o y
Particle degrees in a black hole study?
Slimecicle: so lets just roll with it   *Starts playing D&D*
If you reach out throughout it you’ll be able to see I’m going in and out of creative mode
Ok but can we talk about the perfectly timed lightning 👌⚡ 20:05
Anyone watching this when tommy has 11 million subscribers?
New title: Pill beats the game while tommy and wilbur Charlie are riding slow boats
I don't know why but in 7:07 WilburSoot, said something and in the subtitles it was actually written in Latin in the opposite direction, which was translated into "Sentence in Latin that is true in Latin". Good Job Larry, that you did not disrespected the Latin language, proud of you mate!
This is my favorite Tommyinnit's video
Charlie: Eliza!!!! Me: And Peggy... The Schuyler Sisters!!!!! 😊😊
not me screaming the lyrics to TikTok when charlie and Wilbur were singing to lmao
21:00 two bitches singling & stuff while the others are like, NO WE GOTTA RUN *STRESS NOISES* *SCREAMS* OH FUCK OH FUCK SJSBDKBD
7:07 Damnationem Latine hoc est verum latine actually means Latin sentence is true in Latin (source; Google translate)  Yes I know it’s a joke I just wanted to say it :))
You should have taken a white hole and combined the two holes to make anti matter, essentially blowing up the whole world but hey, at least you are not sucked up and spaghettified
Phil is just trying to collect stuff the entire time while Wilbur Tommy and Charlie and goofing around
SO PREPAIR
but I WILl KILL JESUS AND MR BEAST IS JESUS So I WILL USE THE MOST AFFECTIVE ATTACK:send shrek
Tru
How every video with Wilbur : Wilbur goes insane
I bet you cant beat my level 6 p.e.e.k.a😎
4:09 do it
ok.
Philza is that kind of kid who does all the work in a project while other kids just do no shit
I know all of those songs and I was born in 2010 lol
Does anyone else find it funny how Philza only died to the black hole once and the others like 10 times?
Tommy,Wilbur,Slime:Having Fun Meanwhile Philza Tryharding In The Nether
17:26 if you know where this music is from, you can have a cookie
Wilbur is like William afton in this. He keeps coming back.
The only reference I could get was my shot
"He went long, and then he was gone. He went wide, and then he died." -Slimecicle 2021
🚬🚬🚬🚬
I have a Samsung fridge
Bro tommy you have 11.6M subscribers
Charlie: IF I get sucked in, THEN what? I DONT KNOW!-
Cool
philza: oh hey a black hole, lemme just go caving for all of the video.
not all my fans are 14/16/18 me: iam 11😅😂
Not Charlie's and Wilbur's obscure references making sense to this 14 year old...
I know all those references  My parents are annoying
That’s NOT what they did, like the other people tried, but they failed and died
is it me or did you see tommy change philzas game mode
“WE GOTTA WUN- WE GOTTA FUCKIN RUN”
Wilbur got long and he was gone and he got wide and he died
enjilvavola
I understand all the song references ٩(ര̀ᴗര́)  Also, Editor Larry keeps getting Charlie and Wilbur mixed up because their colors are swapped. :/
some are less then 14
20:56,W3 GOT TO "WUN"
Wilbur went on a boat and flew to the black hole.
Spaghettified to a noodle I know this sounds weird but read this line Noodle noodle noodle Noodle say noodle Noodle to Noodle Noodle asshole noodle Noodle this noodle Noodle got noodle Noodle i noodle Noodle long noodle Noodle How noodle Noodle look noodle  Read only the center line from the bottom up😂

IF eggs get sucked in by the black hole, THEN with enough force can you use a bow and arrow to make an orbit of the black hole? That is my hypothesis.
Better than msa
21:25 Okay now that was epic ngl
20:05 Now that was cinematic!
19:33 He won, but at what cost... 😂
8:19 & 13:42 Why were these moment so *REAL* 😂. These are like actually death reactions lmfao!

Rip charlie
Just Row With It is an insanely powerful D&D podcast featuring Slimecicle on his little boat and OH SHIT IS THAT A BLACK HOLE 18:27
When you said your fans are 14 plus. I’m ten
this mod seems actually terrifying.
Slimecicle: he got wide and then he died
Will and Charlie:referencing things they think Tommy’s 14-18 year old fans won’t get Me 13 getting them all 20:30
This is everyone in Tommys vids  Tommy: Takes it seriously at the ending half------Takes it as a joke and messes around in the beginning  Slime: Finds it as a joke and doesn't care whether he dies or not and acts super stupid  Wilbur: Takes it serious half the time, Takes it as a joke half the time (same as tommy)  Philza: *ACTS LIKE HES IN REAL LIFE AND SPEEDRUNS EVERYTHING AND TELLS EVERYONE TO STOP MESSING AROUND*   *PLAY THE MANHUNT MUSIC: DO-DO-DO-DO-DO*
I am going to turn 11

Technically, all the mass is just in a single, infinitely tiny point. The event horizon is what grows when it's mass is increased. And a weird thing, Technically,  all the "information" of what it absorbs is spread across the event horizon. I'm not gonna explain it but look it up, you may or may not inderstand.
Charlie and Wilbur present the same energy as my science teacher specifically the ‘present it as an if-then statement and maybe we’ll get somewhere’
wtf
19:11
TASTY MUD!?TOMMY WTF?
I would like to see a 100 days of this
20:28 I’m 9😂
Dododododododoodododododododododoododdododooddoododododododod

Fleetway sonic
Tommy: Wilbur?    The chat:  Wilbursoot has fallen out of the world
Tommyinnit: I have a three step plan to beat the black hole, ima get 10 mil subs and install tinder
phil’s out here threatening charlie in the first seconds of the video
Did you know, black holes dont acctually suck, theyjust sit in space until stuff floats inside of it. XD Randum facts
TIK TOK ON THE CLOCK
Your toxic and I’m slipping under
16:13 if you listen to the music, it is the music that plays in Just Cause 3 when you get heat. and it really hit me at 16:30 so I went back to listen to see if it had been there before.
Why is Philza always playing the game
Eg
17:55
azmastergaming04v
I got all of the references is that bad-
SLIMES "ELIZA" SENT ME BACK PLEASE HELP, THE REFERENCES, AAAAAAA.
All of the references that Wilbur made I understood
Im not 14 im 11
WhTa oh sorry i mean what
I love your videos mine suck
I understood every reference and I’m 13
“Bamnationem latine hoc est verum latine” is backwards for what mister beast said in hell to Wilbur, which is Latin and translates to “The sentence in Latin is true in Latin”  What the *hell*
You destroy the dream smp
You Monster
I hat you
I think its even more funny that I'm 13 and still got all the songs they were singing
Black holes in real life slowly evaporate not expand
I'm only 13-
Is it weird that I know all the songs they were singing?
Ohohoho you underestimate me you silly little British Man, for I had a FIVE YEAR LONG HAMILTON PHASE. (it was terrible and as soon as my teacher mentioned the american revolution this year i raised my hand and said some stupid shit like "Oho Mr. -teachers name- You see I am quite knowled-" and was cut off by everyone who knew me yelling loudly.)
I love how tommy set Wilbur to creative and spectator mode and turn him back to survival
5:20 - 5:23 😂😂😂😂
“Male chickens don’t lay eggs. Why did you call him a HEEEEeeeeeee…” - Wilbur Soot
20:45 jokes on you I know that “Ah mr secretary, Mr burr sir” Will anyone get the next line?
I decided to take time out of my day to translate what Wilbur said, i put the video in Premeire Pro, Flipped it and put it throught Google Translate, and it says "sentence in Latin that is true in Latin" if that was just a huge troll the idk what else is
I really love big black holes wbu?
Uh, Did anyone see the potion effect and a potion floating on 15:01 / 22:55?
this is the most intense part 21:29
1:24 "I'ma going in a black hole"
Can we be mud eating  buds?
21:30 what is the music please
as of today he can install tinder legally
wilbur always get ratio'd also get shitted
Hahaha 7 million try 11.6 million
A Black Hole is Faster?!
Ah yes white hole adds more blocks LOL
Tommy : some r 18 some r 16    me and my friends : We r 11
Tommyinit has sucked into black hole
at 13:43 you can see wibur go into survival. HE WAS IN CREATIVE!!!!!!!!
*Wilbur died* Tommy: Oh well..
20:30 wait I am 14 years old
"He went long, then he was gone" "He went wide and then he died" -Charlie Slimecicle 2021
8:01 philza casually floatin over the black hole
let me demonstrate that i am over the age of 20: "mamaaaaaaaaa just killed a man put a gun against his head pulled my trigger now he's deeead mamaaaaaaaaa life had just begun but now I've gone an thrown it aaaalll awaaay mamaaaaaaaaa oooooooooooo didn't mean to make you cry if im not back again this time tomorrow carry on carry on as if nothing really matters"
It’s ok Charlie. You can also eat feastables now!
Tommy got caught cheating at 14:23
Wilbur:All of Tommy's viewers are like 14 Me: ummm... I'm 11
I will never be able to comprehend how wilbur can just make a cult off the top of his head
The charlie wilbur phil tommy group is so amazing
I have watched every single Tommyinnit mod video, and i almost know them all by heart
umm did anyone else see philza going into creative mode (7:50)
Heh
Wilbur and Slimecicle singing songs that the fans supposedly don't know: Me being younger than 14 and knowing all the songs: You were saying?
Tommy: "Phil, what if it's devoured the portal?" *Phil quickly realizes he said something smart this time* Phil: "Oh shit-"
Man im 13 and i get almost all the song references and i got the jetpack joyride reference
Oh so now wilburs possessed or something!?
1:26 ihiaha
Pause at 1:56 and see the command Tommy put in lol
Why does Wilbur always have to be the center of every thing in every single video
Tommy did you pee in your pants cause those pants are yellow
THE HALO MUSIC AT THE END
14:23 tommy is cheating?!?  The nearest fortress is at We GoT lOTs oF EgGs!
Mario galaxy has entered the chat.
It was at 22:45
It was so cinematic when Tommy said he couldn't see it and then the lightning struck and he screamed in terror
Wilbur tries to maky a story out of everything lol
Im 15 bro
who is TommyInnit
Wilbur- what’s some references Tommy’s viewers won’t understand? They’re all like fourteen Me- I’m thirteen and I understand all the references
I love how Phil is doing all the work while everyone else is making content xD
The black starts coming then the fucking halo music kicks in
Instal tinder now.
5:43 actually it is a finitely small particle, at this point it would probably be smaller than the eye can see but it does still have mass
Here’s a translation for what Mr.Beast said in Latin  hodie piscinam tribus miliones orbeez implevimus et insiliemus et salutem inveniemus= today we filled a pool with three million orbeez and we're going to be jumping in and finding salvation
0:09 "Wilbur..?"
Best moments of the video were the Persona 5 music for philza and the jetpack joyride reference
The funnier thing is that their comedy is calling Mr.Beast the king of hell🤣🤣🖤🖤
0:09
Oh god
Lolololol
4:40 to 4:58 the subtitels for willbur and slimesikle got mixed up
Charlie, Wilbur. I am happy to say I am a 15 yr old Tommy fan and I know every song you guys sang
16:04 why was the just cause 3 chase music  playing lmao
Holy shit, jc3 ost!
Tommy* some are 16 some are 18 my little brother walking in my room* I’m 5
A New Video. Wilbuur and slimecycle doing weird stuff and philza and tommy beating the game.the usual
Wilbur and Charlie trying to make a reference tommy's fans wouldn't understand: eLizA aNd PeGgY     Me who has 3 huge obsessions: Dsmp, Wilbur soot, and Hamiltion-
The smaller the black hole the stronger its gravitational pull d: Lets assume that the world is 1e+31 times larger than the black hole and the black hole is getting smaller and the world is getting smaller faster?
What the f
Tommy you made Phil creatve
everyone else: let's mess around Phil: haha speedrun go brrrr
Philza: Plays the game Tommy: Tries to beat the game but gets distracted a lot Charlie: Makes Jokes about holes Wilbur: Three crowns children in clash royale
w- i think your gonna die  c- present it as an if-then statement.  5 minutes later   c- IM GONNA FUCKING DIE w- PRESENT IT AS AN IF-THEN STATEMENT       oh how the tides have turned
"last to leave hell gets a second chance at life"
Todo and I don’t Kano the second one and didn’t hear enough of the third one fourth it tik tak or tik tok
Interesting implication that being sucked into a black hole also makes you develop a dissociative disorder
Black holes expands when they eat matter and shirk when there no matter to eat
you ave now 11 mil sub  wow
Hehe
Tommy is a child
The thunder scene looked so scary it was snowing and it was night time and the thunder flashes and you can see the dang black hole in the back for a split second
I'm 10 and I know all the songs that they sing
this guy never fails to make me laugh :)
this guy never fails to make me laugh :)
this guy never fails to make me laugh :)
Hee hee
Tommy you need this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTfIX-IWx4w
dream stans watching this be like: hes so handsome i have one thing to say to dream stans how weird do you want to be
Dazai:perfect no suffer just little pain,perfect i can do my double suicide with my lady ;)

Ik all thoese refences thir all songs And i like thoese songs
fun fact: 7:08 the subtitles are backwards and spell "damnationem latine hoc est verum latine" wich translates into "sentence in latin that is true in latin"
Minecraft's black hole mod is very funny. ft.mr.beast
Welcome back to Tommy's Pronunciation!: wilbur soot = Wilbah Sut | Philza= philzer | Hahaha = hahAHoohoh Ha'Shhedufhei
checked if i was subscribed or not, thankfully i wasnt
It at the end was like wheres charly he fucking died
Tbh Dr Cicle had a chance to survive by tryna sprint and Wilbur building behind him
Charlie's he he is the funniest thing ever
I'm nerd
im 8
20:34 I may be 10 but this song is a TUNE
7:08 the text is: bamnatinonem hoc est verum latine latine , which doesnt make quite sense even if u put it in google translator,its translated to: bamnatino is true in Latin,which i dont understand kinda ._.
yea it was keith LMAO
That lughtnim shot with the black hole was perfect timing thats poggod
I appreciate the Halo music 👍
Black hole: eating up the entire world Charlie: *sucks dirt*
I’m drinkin fuckin tea and it looks black like.. BlAcK hOlE~~
Did any one else notice at 14:24 tommy searches with commands where the nearest fortress is.
I actually translated Wilburs demon speech its Latin backwards and if you translate it it says "Damnationem latine hoc est verum latine" then in english it says "Latin sentence that is true in Latin" isn't that great?
Heyyyyy sub to tommyinnite
lmao i love hiw they always beat the dragon at the head even tho thats the worsst strategy
21:54 oh, so you lost Charlie in the time, I like how that sad music goes
The black hole is named Terrence clementine the 8th
Wilbur and Charlie trying to confuse the fans  me vibing with them
tommy being dramatic and strong others being calm haha philza plays pro and prepares in every video and tommy being a surviver in each one
Some of his fans are 6 or 12 ,13 or 11
It's about drive it's about power of the back hole
1:25
if big Q was there is gonna swear so hard;-;
Wilbur making the joke all Tommy’s fans are 14 😂😅😅 I’m 20 😅😅
Me just laughing and jamming out and singing with Charlie and Wilber when they said they were Hanna confuse people. Lol
The lightning scared the crap out of me
Where did Wilbur go into creative mode way it's for the video
21:47 that timing was so good it looks like it was scripted
“Black hole” if you know u know
Philza is such a good dad
you can't tell me this was a year ago 😫
Wilbur: "All of Tommy's fans are 14!" Me being 14:
They tried to make a reference that the Tommy fans wouldn’t understand what they make a reference it’s nobody else understand that
I love it how Phil is just surviving in the nether while Charlie is just making boat puns.
Mr Beast = The Lorax  he speaks for the trees
i love how they basically said mr beast is satan XD
Black+Hole black p word
Hey Tom I'm 9 but do I care no
me when i go to taco bell:
21:47 the timing was so perfect and dramatic for this scene, it was almost like a movie! I'm suprised this was not carefuly planned out. Great job!
i like how at 1:56 it shows tommy making it inflate bigger
IMA GOING IN A BLACK HOLE🤣🤣
He [Tommy: set philza game mode to creative mod]  7:53
Finding lava using sound 11:40
*philza and tommy paniking about the blackhhole and beating the game*  wilbur and charlie: *IMA GET A SCOLERSHIP TO KINGS COLLAGE*
with his face of a little child and he is telling me to subscribe i can't not subscribe
7:44 is the creepiest part to me for some reason
What the hekk is it halo ?
At least they completed the challenge
That bit at the ender portal was awesome. That was like an action movie, escaping death through the portal in slow motion just before the black hole consumes it.
I love how Wilbur’s skin already looks traumatized even before the black hole
I love how Philza and Tommy are just trying to play the game, but Charlie and Wilbur are being professors confronting the uncaring void consuming all they know and hopelessly attempting to stop an unstoppable force of void and death and nothingness.
Tommy:im the golden boi not piss pants nobody called me piss pants in school.philza:oh ok
MULE BITS GET YOUR MULE BITS
So are 12
When they started singing tick tock I died
there have been countless times tommy has said: PHILLLLLLLL
He now has ten mil, now the only thing he has to do is install tinder….illegally
Tommy:We are getting close to 7 million subscribers Me watching in 2022: That says 11 million dude
this mf ks trying to speedrun DUDE HIDE RUN TO A FAR PLACE
Why circle? Why circle in square game?
Did they not watch dream gogy and sap try this..  🤣🤣🤣
tommy says we see him annoying but i like him i wish i was his brother
Not all his viewers are 14-16-18 some are 11 like me :)
This is almost a year old😟
Charlie:He He Charlie:dies Me:HE HE to ur death
Didn't know anyone else besides my friend thought mud was tasty
Flop
Video 11 months subs 11 m
Tomm in nit play vr 10Wika
MAKE IT POP DJ BLOW MY SPEAKERS UP TONIGHT IMA FIGHT TIL WE SEE THE SUNLIGHT TICK TOCK ON THE CLOCK BUT THE PARTY DONT STOP NO OH OH O OHHHHH
7:07 if you reverse the subtitles and translate in from latin to english it says (this probaly isn't to accurate but catches the spirit): This is true in Latin to the English sentence
I have a question how do you have more subscribers than Technoblade  I was just wondering because I just noticed
Wilber: what's a sentence that Tommy's viewers won't get  Me* gets all of them*  +__+
7:08 "damnationem latine hoc est verum latine" Witch means in English "sentence in Latin that is true in Latin"
19:57 I love that everyone is freaking out and Slime is just talking about angry birds and jet pack joyride😂
and almost a year later, an actual particle discovered by a quantum physicist is being named after tommyinnit
13:09
20:30 me:theres younger ones......anyways
Fun fact Charlie's wrong. Glasses *can* count as eye protection if they're impact/shatter resistant and stop things from *getting in your eyes.*
{\___/} (•___•) (3🍪) im stupid
I love how Wilbur and Charlie in all these videos act like immature little kids
being 13 knowing all thoose songs: AWW sweet nice taste guys
the fact tommy names every mod video funny but he's obviously stressed in them-
20:56 did yall notice the word wun?
in today’s mod, wilbur and charlie slmccl becomes scientists while meeting the lord of hell, mrbeast
I just realised.when Tommy says “us” he actually says “uz” so he has an American accent!
I’ve never laughed so much. I’m on a long car ride and my parents think I’m crazy 😂
Hacks I saw tommy search where the nearest fortress was and saw multiple times change game mode to creative to survival
LOL😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😞🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤩🤣🤣😂
So at the beginning of the video, the black hole has a radius of 1 block (~1m). According to the Schwarzschild radius formula, the black hole starts the video with an approximate mass of 673317654820452886390333949 kg or about 113 times the mass of earth
1:20 Don’t mind me Personal time mark-
I want to know about Wilbur playing Clash Royale
subsribe to Mr. Beast
Why someone was in Creative mode
that halo music at the end... i love it.
"im going in a black hole" had me dying for hours
tommy i am 12
I like where Tommy just screams when they are in ice biome
“Go and speak to Karl jacobs” I don’t know why I found that so funny 😂
Why dose your YouTube Chanel look like u casted
14:24 SO NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW TOMMY DID /LOCATE?!
Tommy: *Panicking since the black hole is expanding and getting closer to them* Charlie: Guy's favorite  jetpack joyride jetpack
The Michael Jackson part killed me
Random thing, what is Phil's  will?
mrbeast : TODAY I JUST BOUGHT HELL me : ok.
Wilbur: keeps roleplaying  Philza: is in the nether with 3 stacks of gold bars
Dream did a video of this mod as well
20:06  Perfect timing. But scary too
He got hard, then an angel guard.
He got hard, then an angel guard.
9:02 5 Minute Crafts
I’m still waiting for Tommy to download tinder,   Illegally.
14:44
some are 16 some are 18 im 10
The big succ
20:07 that lightning strikes good bro
He’s at 11.5m where’s the tinder video
me who was 11 when this video came out and still got the obscure reverence
I knew the references lol get rekt
I love that u think people who are watching u are 14 and over but I’m 10 😂
He cheated in 14:30 btw locating a end fortress or something
Every video philza tries to get stuff while the others are joking around is amazing
AYO guys look at 5:33 in the chat they are using creative mode??!?!??!?
14:11 editor's issues right here
Bruh
wilbur's and charlies colors switched >:)
Jump in the Cadillac
We need Wilbur and Charlie to sing more songs together
7 million, more like 11.5
Philz’s the only one who plays properly
is it just me or did he say if he gets ten million he's installing tinder????? he has 11.5 million.
Lol we just gonna ignore how Tommy changed the weather to clear and Phil had three stacks of gold 🤣
You are beast😀
I swear, they each bring something.  Tommy, some jokes about women or his hight but also knows when it is time to panic. Philza, a voice of reason as well as occasional chaos. Charlie, effectively if you wrote in a joke and it became human. Also random side plot. Wilbur, he really just goes with Charlie and casually makes lore.
Literally every mod video ever  Philza: speedrunning the game and actually trying   Wilber: starting some sort of weird as cult  Charlie: making puns and being funny AF  Tommy: either helping Phil or being dumb with will and Charlie
I love how Wilbur goes insane in all of Tommy’s videos
“ I can’t wait to get hilariously plunged into the dark void of space.” -Charlie
Pog
I am thirteen exuse  me
Lol
WAIT THIS WAS ALMOST A YEAR AGO
do you  know no one saw that in 14:11 charlie said he got long the caption said if I get sucked in.
The only video they actualy won the game
He hee- ahh ahh
“i spotted that with my ears” whta kind of mushrooms did u have tommy
i like him but he swears too much,
Phill went to creative their sus
They went in creative and survival …
In actuality a black hole of the size at the start would have the mass of Jupiter roughly and would decay through hawking radiation for millions of years also the immense mass would technically make it fall to the centre of the earth and then the earth would quickly collapse
Pause and look at chat at 21:29
philza has the kisuke skin from bleach
6:17
😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐 Damn fam you got the whole chat laughing.
I like tommyinnit
phil just trying to beat the game
I got both references
I'm not that young.
If you listen close enough you can hear Persona music on philza's part 18:54
22:05 set own game mode to creative*
When Charlie said: he went long then was gone and the he went wide then died
i find it funny that in all these vids Wilbur just goes insane
fun fact:before willbur got his channel he was a therapy doctor
im genuinely wondering how wilbure escaped the black hole
Hey Tommy that black hole looks like a massive ball
eee heee oh AHHH
5:33 hold on a diddly darn second there why does it say Tommyinnit: set own gamemode to Creative mode?? 7:56  Philza this time?? bro thats kinda sus
Wilbur: The black hole is in my body, The black hole is in my body! Me: No I think you're just hungry mate.
Bruv Tommy used /locate beginning when he went into nether
Them:suffering in the black hole philza:relaxing
That moment when you want to watch slime and wilbur but can't stand this tommy guy
"finally beat a challenge" *uses /locate fortress half way through vid*
Bro 1:25 literally killed me
You guys should have lived in the nether.
2:18
2:19
.... So toxic hahaha
"go Speak to karl jacobs, FUCK YOU"  i will go speak to karl
5:04 slimes face lol
being sucked in blac hole  Phil: I'm Mining diamonds :D
The fact I new most of the songs wilbur and Charlie were making while trying to confuse us just show they needed older songs😑
Tommy legit said wun LOL
5:02 That almost made me cry 😢 4:23
Made me feel less shitty/depressed, liked and subbed
7:09 about the sentence that he says backwards, if you flip that it reads "damnation latine hoc est latine" which, in Latin, reads "sentence in Latin that is in Latin." Ty editor.
congrats on 11 million ;D
1:22
Are you telling me...         THEY WERE REFERENCING HAMILTON!!?????
Why is there a pig noise acter he dies 8:19
Jump in the Cadillac girls put some miles on it
Why Karl??? Why Karl Tommy????
This video is literally everybody being stupid you’re talking about Mr. B’s being in a black hole but in reality he would not be able to live in there because there is a singularity which has infinite tininess and would rip you in the atomic levels making you unable to do anything and you will eventually die and black holes are so powerful Not even like 10 escape they’re power not even like 10 escape their event horizon by the way event horizon is the point where you can never return and you will forever be stuck there
L like  indr ytr
Cool we got an areal view of Tommy’s brutal murder
THIS VIDEO IS TOO EPIC
Look behind you
How do you wanna die...?
jump in the cadillac
I’m The Golden Boy!
20:44
Wilbur trying to find something we won't know Also, Wilbur "CAUSE THE TASTE OF YOUR LIPS ON A RIDE" Me knowing the song immediately "YOUR TOXIC-" Wilbur and Charlie singing even other song Me I KNOW THESE ALL IM 12 *singing along*
Yes yes
4:49 the subtitle colours swapped.
7:08 "damnationem latine hoc est verum latine" when you put it in a mirror and if you translate that it is "sentence in Latin that is true in Latin"
Why did slimecicles subtitles turn purple?
Anyone know what that song was when they jumped through the portal near 21:30
How is this the mod they beat
Tommy some are 16 some are 18 me some are 12
I got a lot of the reference and I’m younger then 14
Charlie is all like “my fig newtons are getting soggy.” while Philza is beating the whole game.
Damm it sucks hard
At the beginning of the video mod sound like mob for me
Watching Phil speed run the nether to willpower has empowered my existence.
Who is Mr best
7:08 he really just said "this sentence is true" in old Latin 😂
"We gotta wrun,we gotta run" - Tommy
them- trying to confuse tommy viewers: Singing 90s and early 2000s pop me- knowing old kesha and britney songs bc i hate new music: Ah, yes, so much confusion :)
Once again wIlBa goes insane😞
There JOKIN around
“Hey Charlie, d- how- how do you wanna d i e?” “That sounds like less of a question and more of a threat.”
1:25 is Michael Jackson back
20:07 was pretty scary

Me being 12 understanding all those references
🤪🤪🤪
Charlie’s Poem: I have a feeling that you are also gonna be spaghettiified  He got long and he was gone, We went wide and then he died.
the unsubscribe thing happened tommy
Every time Wilbur is in one of these mod videos he creates a cult, goes insane, or deems himself god. And tubbo or Charlie are always stuck with him
any one else notice how tommy used a command to find the nearest fortess?
January 2022, 15th on a Saturday and this has 666k likes 💀

i love how wilbur and charlie were like "tommys audience is all 14, let's do references they won't understand" and proceeded to reference stuff every 14 year old grew up on
Philza was the only one actually trying to beat the game!

Nobody wondering why they want a baby chicken nd an adult chicken to do it

For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16🤍
They added philza’s age in game!!!!!!!
14:24 Read the chat😭😭😂😂
TOOO EASY
at 7:09 The  capsion is saying : damnationem latine hoc est verum latine And that translates into: Latin sentence this is true in Latin
5:55
anybody catch how tommy set his gamemode to creative at the timing of 5:32 in the video
I’m 11 and I quick got the toxic reference instantly
Dude everyone is joking while Phil is serious
14:10 the subtitles arent perfect
(pretend this is in fancy cursive) Prof. Cicle's final hypothesis-                     "I'm gonna die! That's my hypothesis- I'm gonna die!"
*me whose twelve and got all of those references especially Hamilton*
tik tok and toxic
8:12 current objective *survive*
14:10 nice subtitles
At 16:25 he uses the just cause 3 music
7:52 Phil is in creative
Dragon has more fans then tommy pog
11:53 I like how they used call of duty modern warfare music😆😆😆😆
The black hole socket Tommy so that means it should be in prison
New video title philz a beats the game and everyone else is there too
How the frick did Wilbur actually know I was fourteen what the hell
I'm 12 and I know all these songs 🤣
I'ma going in a black hole hehe
20:22 I'm 16 would have been fifteen when this was released. Just saying I may be young but I got all of those references.
Just realized Wilbur plays mini pekka and rhe respect has gone 📈📈📈
"He went wide, and then he died," "He got long, and then he was gone," Me: ***Laughing my ass off***
69
I want to animate this whole video, it’s a strong erdge
Well you see, Wilbur. I’m 13, but I’m something ppl call “cultured”, so I knew ever one of the references you said. Just saying. Btw big fan of all y’all.
Do you go outside
I'm almost 14 and I got all of those references that Wilbur and Slimecicle made- Was I not supposed to?
it said I didn't subbed when I subbed (I subbed again it just hates me)
They’re all fucking around then there’s just Phil  speed running the game hahahaha
why is cuphead's the root pack music inside tommyinnit's video
7:05  For anybody who's interested, according to google translate, it says "sentence in Latin that is true in Latin"  Of course in true latin, it means "TODAY, WE FILLED A POOL WITH 3 MILLION ORBIES".  This further proves how Google Translate is faulty.
i love how there's almost always two different advenures happening
When Phil was speedrunning, is it bad that I recognized the music within 3 notes? ... I played too much Persona 5 in these past two years wtf-
wow TommyInnit you have 11 Million subs! Edit: Today... (i forgot about it)
Tommy, you got 10 million subscribers.     Where's Tinder?  /j
6:38 tommy:😂😐
Wilbur and Charlie singing Kesha as they did To a black hole is the most them thing ever
Philza is going to be the next best speedeunner
Sam: **joking about jetpack joyride jetpacks** Tommy: *SHUT UP WE'RE GONNA DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*
19:33 I love how Wilbur was playing clash Royale while Phil was speed running and tommy and slime were fleeing in terror
this video should be' Ph1Lza beats the game while Tommy, Wilbur and Charlie struggle to survive'
8:41 wilbur is vibing with Mr.Beast in the fiery depths of hell with a 10 Million dollar bottle of milk
i am 14 and i know all those songs
20:05 That thunder gave me real villain vibes there.
Charlie tried to kill swaggersouls
* Philza and Tommy running for there lives *  Wilbur and cicle singing old songs and dieing *
Im 15, but i know ever reference you made. Then again i grew up listening to my moms favorate music, and that was all music from the 80's-2010's
i love how will and charli have the same energy
1
How's installing Tinder illegally coming along then?
I not a teenager and I knew the references!
I'm 14 and got legit every reference
Tommy: u playing clash of clans? Slimecicle: proceeds to play clash Royale
Look at the bottom left 14:24
other people: *farm totems of undying* TommyInnit: f*ck totems warthrog run better
I know all the memes ands songs they did
"You just got balled" ending
i got all of those references and i’m under 18 🐸☝️
Anyone noticed that Tommy changed Philzas gamemode into creative
TommyInnit now has 11.4 million subs, he now needs tinder to stop this.
1:25 michael slimeson
pov: you unsub after wtaching this
Some are 10
I'm 11 and know all the songs 😄 I like them to I was raised well
umm.... just so you know im 10
20:28 im 13 and i knew all the songs 😂
Tommy I am also scared of black holes
I understood all music references
micheal jackson is a live charle
Tommy:Flipin around Phil:Full surviver mode Me:Full late mode Wilbur&Dr.cicle:Full "DOCTER MODE"
I love that Charlie and Wilbur were just singing hamilton. Straight up all of My Shot. That is hilarious
Bruh I am 11 years old
🎶 Going in a black hole in a black hole Ina Black hole ae you ate me you ate me you ate me ae you've been struck by a strong criminal 🎶 😎
Practising to be skinny
mabby mr beast spawned the blackhole :)
And some are 12
when phil went into spectator then creative ;))))
7:53 if you look in corner for  a split second Tommy set Phil's game mode to creative🤣
tommyinnit subs are 14 16 18? im 11
BBC = Big Black Circle
like the song that they randomly start to sing that were made before I was born I started to sing along to lol and I am 12 lol
9:01 lmao
I love how: Philza: Actually plays the game Tommy: Tommy Slimecicle: Wants everyone to understand that everyone is going to get spagettified Wilbur: Sees some shit
M
There singing Hamilton thinking we won’t get it but I know the play by heart and it makes me happy that they know what it is
Summer nine like me
is it just me or did no one else notice the just cause 3 music playing in the background at around 16:00? lmao
I understand all the jokes I'm 11
Please stop doing your face cam it's f cringe 🤢
Me who knows that the smaller a black hole is the more powerful and the longer range it has
Charlie “HEE HEE... OH OH!” *dies*
Jeez, how close was that...
lol he used locate command to see where is fortress
I’m a 14-year-old and I understood every reference
You know Tommy's videos remind me of Carsons, the best thing about them are his friends
The music at 16:13 is from just cause
16:23 insert just cause music heat level three (comment has been here for six months and now I feel cringed about it)   It’s been a goddamn year Bruh   It’s been two goddamn years  It’s been three goddamn years now, bro…this will also be my 1000 sub mark
Honestly by now I think Tommy’s most common phrase is „PHIIIIILLL“
i know im late to this but did nobody realise that at 7:55 tommy set phils gamemode to creative
michael jackson is my second name
Awesome
Does anybody else notice that every time Tommy beats a mod he says "We finally beat a f*ckin challenge"          He's beat like all of them
The end of the video:   Tommy and Phil successfully beat the game.         Charlie and Will: Singing Tik Tok by Kesha
everyone: *on boats* Ph1Lza: *is currently beating the game*
21:47 my heart stopped when they almost died to the black hole
0:24 "hey Charlie h- how do you wanna die"- philza
Is it bad that I got the obscure reference Wilbur was trying to refer to even though I'm quite young :'D
I got two of the references only being 12. The first one is toxic by Brittney spears and third one is from hamilton.
“He went long and then he was gone. He went wide and then he died.” -Charlie
hey tommy do you see ranboos real face without glasses and mask
I love how wilbur says that the songs he sang are things tommys fans wont know Im 11 and i know those songs :/ Edit: what the fuck i was 11 when i watched this im 15 now.
7:07 actually translates (from latin to english) bamntionem latine hoc est verum latine = basntion in Latin that is true in Latin
Tommy and Phil speed running the game  Charlie and Wilbur just singing songs. Charlie "I ain't comin back" Wilbur "I'm talkin pedicure on me toes tryna get with da partay." And when they started they all mess around while Phil is just speedrunning the game with da "do do do do" intense song😂🤣
Wilbur and slimecicle singing songs 14 year olds don’t know: Me being 13 and knowing almost all of them: ._.
Ok ok mi  name  is terrance
20:32 I understand everything and I am only 13
which means that it can eat up a galaxy in a millisecond so THIS IS NOT REALISTIC
fun fact:  the mass of the black hole at: 5:54 is as much as 3 Milky Way galaxies.
Halo music nice call back
Please not Charlie and Wilbur singing Hamilton 😂😂
7:54 - look at chat~
Wilber got wide and then he died
Tommy: ITS TIME TO WUN
I’m 9
i’m 12
That lightning that showed where the black hole was was perfect
Its a third minute of a video and they still dont have staff
love your videos im a big fan :):):):):):)
The sentance that Mr. Beast told Will actually translates to " latin sentence is true in latin" Also, I google translated it several times and got "Today we are going to fill the pool with a million balls and dive in to find freedom!"

“Damnationel latine, hoc verum latine” -Mr.Beast
Even though I was a bit older I was just the one who told you to be able and I was really excited to see you are the same as the best in your career but it is used in the same manner that I can relate with you to a different person in a good time relationship and you can also make a lot more to work and be able and to do something that is not a good idea but you are in the best interests you have ever had and it will help them the best way you are the same and the best of the world is the same thing you are the most in a league and you are in the process and you can get the best way of life and you are in a league of two and the best
At 4:40 will and Charlie’s text colours swapped
Wilbur sailed through the air on his teeny boat
17:26 I like the use of Persona combat music for Phil's grinding here lmao
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO ILLEGLLY INSTAL TINDER TOMMY
Why is it that I am 14 and I know all of the songs that Will and Charlie were singing?
21:22 THE CUT-
Everything to tommy is hilarious or very funny
4:08 "I am going to get ten-million subscribers and install tinder"
Bamnationem latinem
7M BUT HES IN 11M
LOL
Alright wilbur said damnationem latine hoc est verum latine wich translates to sentence in "latin that is true in latin"
11:20 No. It s about drive, it’s about power!
0:17 Shoutout to schlatts facial hair.
Come down today and try some corn or we will sacrifice your newborn HAAAWWW
In every single one of these videos, I notice that it’s usually Philza that is the one trying to survive and play the game
is just me or no will i wus just thinking tommy is gonna be man now and im like wat that fast
Didn't he just copy dream a week later?
and then he went wide and he died
to easy
7:43  oh no its like Stranger Things-
Phil's audio while he's alone in the nether sounds like it's from Sally Face
He said mob Instead of mod
mr beast is the icon of sin
"Tommy, Wilbur and Charlie being on crack for 22 minutes while Phil speedruns to save his life from the black hole."
More lore than the dream smp lol
I love how philza is speedrunning when tommy and wilbur and slime keeps dying Philza is like dream philza wants to be dream lol
HEEHEE OOH  imma going in a black hole
“Their all 17 let’s make a reference that the don’t know” Me: I know most of the stuff your saying and I’m not 17
I like how he is playing just cause 3 wanted music for intense music
I wonder if he will hit 7 million
im 12 dont tell my mom
I’m piss pants as well :D
I understood every single  reference that they were making that they thought people my age wouldn't understand
The random Halo music was unexpected but appreciated
I cant stop watching tommy’s mod video’s when i just took my nearly(?) everyday nap and feel like i just cried and poop out ear wax crying- thats what i feel like right now. Im dying but laughing but crying and my mind is not livinngm :7
6:16 He doesn’t allow drugs but allows the f word?
Tommy makes the best insults

"when i have 10million subs, ill install tinder....illegally"  also tommy: gets 11million subs
some people being younger than 16....
Umm Is it just me or at 5:39 did the chat say That charlie was in creative?
Your not getting close to 7m subs, you at 11.3M subs!
Me not even being a teenager and knowing all of the song references
When we have 30 seconds to escape before the sun consumes the earth 21:28
this was the most stressing mod Ive ever seen by tommy
Tommy goes to tinder and just see mr black hole😂
WE CRACKED THE CODE NOW DIE DIE FOR SCIENCE!!

ahahah creative phil
7:56   "TommyInnit set Ph1LzA's game mode  to creative."
Sheeeeeeeeesh
I've picked up a concerning amount of casual latin from googling Editor Larry's backwards subtitles across these videos and I'm pretty sure it's almost always Wilbur's fault
I’m late but the ima going in a black hole cracked me up
Hi
Hi Thomas
wilbur , charlie , tommy are having fun  and philza is hardly workin
Is iyt me or in the end  i see set own game mode creative or is like a coincidence?
Wilbur: I screamed into the stars and they laughed at me.  Me: Damn, that's deep. *has existential crisis*
20:05 Thats some horror movie stuff dude...
“Your probably going to be spaghettified”  Me: Is eating spaghetti 🍝
im 11, and at 20:32 i was vibin with them so hard
20:06 wow nice a combo of the jump scare of the black hole (lightning)
If you were born in 2021 and your birthday present is 5-10-1994, what color is the sky?
Wilbur really just said that all Tommy’s viewers are 14, I’m younger than 14…. Sooooooo
He uses so much halo music which i love
ギルクラな列やエリ。しりひれてやぜ Thx☆時年分日時年ε=ε=ε=ε=ε=ε=┌(;￣◇￣)┘
(*☻-☻*)
Tommy I have a question        Tommy, is philza your father/dad? and this is for Tommy only don’t answer my question  [sorry for this question]
HOW MANY FEET ARE YOU? Oh wait BRITISH BOI MEETERS!
“He got long, then he was gone” those were the words my mum said before my dad left
:DDD
You guys talked about getting sucked so much
17:23 i started laughing at wilbur saying "Im at 3 bubbles"
I love that they just making all of the song references and I understood all of them. When they started singing hamilton i started up the song and sung all the lyrics. I'm a tad obsessed.
Monk E https://youtu.be/tzZebTWZy58
'he became wide and then he died'
Ahem Philz’s got turned into spectator that’s sus
imagine going to the nether , you would be complete safe
Jetpack joyride Jetpack 😟😟😟😟🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
A
20:05 that was actually a really fucking cool shot
he hasnt got tinder yet
14:45 is that? Is that the Just Cause 3 ost ?
Im 11 and i know #1 #2 and #4 i know those references
BRUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
TOMMY CJ EJDJD RA WJRHFASJJDFJFJYJ WDJFH ZH EHDJEWJHWHE ARE YOU HACKER? HACK L HDJD O JEIDFKL
At 14:23 did any one else see the locate command sorry if this is a repeat
Phil just casually speedrunning with Persona 5’s Will Power is oddly fitting.
Some of Tommy's viewers are 14, 16, 18, and one of them is 10 with a VERY DIRTY MIND
21:19 omfg this was. THE TIMING, PERFECTION LMFAO I know the song because of my dearest mother
"And Im goin in a black hole" LMAO
Some fans are 25
''[TommyInnit: Set Ph1lzA's game mode to Creative Mode]''
im sub your video tommy 😎
I like how at the end the Black Hole just full sends at Wilbur and Slimecicle and then godspeeds over to Tommy and Phil
20:33 Jokes on you Wilbur I know that song cause I’m an old coot
What IS it with you and my name, clementine?! God DAMN it I'm NOT  a moth OR a black hole!!!!
Wait a minute, why does the color of the captions for wilbur and charlie keep swapping?
The mrbeast bit is too funny 🤣🤣
At the end why did tommy have 2 spectral arrows
Props to Tommy for using the Just Cause 3 wanted music 16:05
I guessed the mass of the black hole. Assuming the radius to be 40 blocks or 40 meters / 131' 3'', multiplying that by the square of lightspeed and dividing it by twice the gravitational constant, i came to the conclusion that the mass of this black hole is about 2,694 * 10^28 kilograms (5,939 * 10^28 lbs)  As a comparison: the mass of the earth is 5,976*10^24 kg (1,3175 * 10^25 lbs). The mass of this black hole is about 4.500x the mass of the earth. I think it's gravity should be a lot stronger at the place you are. Another calculation: multiplying the mass with the gravitational constant and dividing it by the square of the distance between the center of the black hole and your position (let's say 500 m / 1640' 5''. The result is a gravitational pull of about 7,19 * 10^12 m/s², which is 730 Billion times the earth's gravity.    TL,DR: If there was a black hole this size that close to you IRL, you'd be dead right where you're standing.
Im 11 and know the referentes form willbur
When I’m sad I watch his videos to make me feel better
“Ima going In a black hole” -My laugh burst
Some are 30...
From 4:45 to 4:59 Charlie and Wilbur's colors (for the subtitles) are switched.
🤣🤣🤣 the POV differences is hilarious
lol you need a haircut
From 6.63m to 11.2m in just 9 months good job Tommy keep up the good work
Not me being 14 and knowing all of wilbur and Charlie's song references
Jump in da catalac
btw im only 13
It's over there sucking and I'm over here and I'm sucking  - Charlie Slimecicle 2021
20:32 some are 11 :)
You could say Charlie inherited the real Michael Jackson dying 😂
Hello tomes and whu are you 🤲 and you dont like empty rooms go look at the backrooms amd something of low blood tommy....sorry ment.... tommes
I love how in every video philza’s the only one who actually tries to beat the game
21:26
Me being one of his younger viewers yet understanding every reference•v• your tricks don’t work on me!
@mrbeast
1:25
The editor did a really good job editing dis.
I don't know why but when Phil says "Hey Charlie, how do you want to die" I die of laughter
Timmy ain’t tit
you guys its "what doesn't kill you make you stronger"
6:17
Charlie and Wilbur are the dynamic duo of these videos! Lol
I have a question, after the recording finishes, do you delete these worlds?
7:54 My dissapoitment..
Slimecicle: He got wide and then he died. Michal Scott: That's what she said.
A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing — no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light — can escape from it.[7] The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.[8][9] The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, according to general relativity it has no locally detectable features.[10] In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.[11][12] Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for black holes of stellar mass, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.  Blackness of space with black marked as center of donut of orange and red gases The supermassive black hole at the core of supergiant elliptical galaxy Messier 87, with a mass about 7 billion times that of the Sun,[1] as depicted in the first false-colour image in radio waves released by the Event Horizon Telescope (10 April 2019).[2][3][4][5] Visible are the crescent-shaped emission ring and central shadow,[6] which are gravitationally magnified views of the black hole's photon ring and the photon capture zone of its event horizon. The crescent shape arises from the black hole's rotation and relativistic beaming; the shadow is about 2.6 times the diameter of the event horizon.[3]  Animated simulation of a Schwarzschild black hole with a galaxy passing behind in a plane perpendicular to the line-of-sight. Around and at the time of exact alignment (syzygy), extreme gravitational lensing of the galaxy by the black hole is observed. Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace.[13] The first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole was found by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916, and its interpretation as a region of space from which nothing can escape was first published by David Finkelstein in 1958. Black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity; it was not until the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity. The discovery of neutron stars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967 sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality. The first black hole known as such was Cygnus X-1, identified by several researchers independently in 1971.[14][15]  Black holes of stellar mass form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, supermassive black holes of millions of solar masses (M☉) may form. There is consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most galaxies.  The presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with electromagnetic radiation such as visible light. Matter that falls onto a black hole can form an external accretion disk heated by friction, forming quasars, some of the brightest objects in the universe. Stars passing too close to a supermassive black hole can be shred into streamers that shine very brightly before being "swallowed."[16] If there are other stars orbiting a black hole, their orbits can be used to determine the black hole's mass and location. Such observations can be used to exclude possible alternatives such as neutron stars. In this way, astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in binary systems, and established that the radio source known as Sagittarius A*, at the core of the Milky Way galaxy, contains a supermassive black hole of about 4.3 million solar masses.  On 11 February 2016, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo collaboration announced the first direct detection of gravitational waves, which also represented the first observation of a black hole merger.[17] As of December 2018, eleven gravitational wave events have been observed that originated from ten merging black holes (along with one binary neutron star merger).[18][19] On 10 April 2019, the first direct image of a black hole and its vicinity was published, following observations made by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) in 2017 of the supermassive black hole in Messier 87's galactic centre.[3][20][21] In March 2021, the EHT Collaboration presented, for the first time, a polarized-based image of the black hole which may help better reveal the forces giving rise to quasars.[22]  As of 2021, the nearest known body thought to be a black hole is around 1500 light-years away (see List of nearest black holes). Though only a couple dozen black holes have been found so far in the Milky Way, there are thought to be hundreds of millions, most of which are solitary and do not cause emission of radiation,[23] so would only be detectable by gravitational lensing.         so yea black holes suck lights dick and the universes ass
when they started singing toxic i, as a late 2000s kid, understood that reference. :)
Wilbur got high, then he died
1:55 Invalid integer '0.5' ...hole pull 0.5<--[HERE]
Slimecicle: Hihi- AHHH
Why not use the boats on ice? They go super fast in vanilla, so it should be able to counteract the pull of B.H.
pooooooooooooooooooog vidio （⊙ｏ⊙）
jumping innit
The fact that Philza was doing the Philza grind in the nether while Will, Charlie, and Tommy are trying to escape a vast nothingness
Wait ain’t the black hole a sphere…
For anyone wondering, at 7:07 the ACTUAL translation is: "In Latin this sentence is true." smh my head
I’m 11
20:43 ✨eLiZa✨
"I'ma goin' in a black hole!" LOL, This is why I love watching charlie and tommy, They're funny, That's why.
I love your vids
As a 19 yr old I got all ur references lmao
"NOW DIE, DIE FOR SCIENCE"
Ah yes. The time when Tommy had close to 7 mil subs. The old times. Now he's at 11 mil.
I know all of the references that “Tommyinnit fans wouldn’t get” what can I say Kesha (I probably butchered that spelling) and Hamilton are amazing😌
20:05  "I can't even see it" **ominous lightning flash** "AAAHHHHH"
I love that  Smooth criminal remix Charlie made
I'm a Tommy fan and I understood everything they said that they thought tommy fans wouldnt get lol
did anyonne see tommy put philza mincraft into creative or are we not going to talk about that
I translated the Language, it says: This is true in latin.
I got fucking whiplash when will and charlie started singing the Kesha song like NoN Of TOmMy’S FanS WIll GEt THIS RefErENcE    *sobbing*
I like how slimecicle said he - he and said i'ma going in a black hole it's funny 😂
They failed to confuse me. Who else recognizes all of those songs?
that black hole came speeding in 21.17
21:28 is the best moment in this video tbh
20:20 me who understands evrything: bro im not even 14
What kinda things you sucking, Charlie?
Im a fan and im 11
The black hole: about to absolutely destroy them. Wilber: “Let’s play Clash Royal!”
this statment right here: 20:23 is wrong. I was born in 2008 and I understand all the references. I think I might mentaly 57.
I'ma going in a black hole
Wilber and Charlie singing early 2000s songs    Me: *literally singing every single early 2000s song*    My brother:Whaaaaaa??
21:49 was so dramatic and cool
It’s time for you to download tinder illegally 😏
Too easy
You’re mean on the dream SMP
tommy used /locate it chows in the first few second they are in the nether
I wish I could play this mod but it might lag so bad
Some are 9 like me no actually 11
Tommy’s the kinda guy to see a black hole and ask “is anyone gonna eat that?” and not wait for an answer
Tommy refers to Philza as creator of woman lol
innittommy
Slimecicle Tommy and Wilbur : riding the boat peacefully             Philza: getting enderpearls and killing blazes epic music in the background
Bro  I like how philza is doing great on the nether 😂😂
A black hole w/ the mass of our earth would be about 1 meter wide
im 11 years old
thats what she said 17:04
ಠ_ಠ
I love how TOMMY was so stressed trying to escape while Will and Charlie were just singing and having fun XD
I love these mods
Ok but when they were talking about the songs i knew all of them and started to sing along
If u pAuse at 22:05 u can see that Charlie is in creative mode
u want me to fucking out me
5:02 that’s my favourite 😂
7:51 on the bottom right it says Tommy set phills game mode to creative…sus
Please I am 14 lol
"your viewers are all 14" "No, some are 14, 16, maybe even 18!" *Me ( a 10 year old )*  wait a damn minute
Your toxic im slipping under da da da da. Song is toxic one of my fav songs and I'm 2008
My favorite Bruno Mars lyrics is: *Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it* *Anything you want, just to put a smile on it* *You deserve it baby, you deserve it all* *And I'm gonna give it to you*
Wilbursoot and Slimecocle kinda remind me of Rick and Morty XD
I understood the Toxic reference, that’s all I got.
20:24 some are 14 some are 16 some are 18  Me: I'm 12 hehe
You said some were 14 and 18 well I'm 9😳
Hi.
im 12 and i got some of the references
Hey tommy sometime could we please meet irl, because I love your YouTube channel,and by the way im 8 years old
i love this mod i am MEGA jealous
literally every tommy video: tommy: stressing wilbur and slime: not taking it seriously  philza: *du du du du mode*
Wilbur: they’re all 14 me:im fucking 9
1:25
This is like- the hundredth time I've watched, I FUCKING LAUGH ANYWAY BECAUSE IT'S FUNNY
Tommy, with you and the others— ANYTHING is funny…
we gotta wun
Editing mistake on the captions at 14:07
Did any body see the go in creative
I love the Halo 3 music that plays!
At 20:24 Charlie and Wilbur star making references for people over 14 im 12 and I new every single reference
tommy: in a rush also tommy: bridging incredibly slowly
Me n the future like you have 11.2 subs
Mod isnt funny
"today we added black"
Tommy, Wilber and slimecicle: *are in boats doing really dumb stuff, while getting sucked in a black hole*. Meanwhile Philza: *f**king beating the game and not getting sucked into a black hole, (with rock music)*.
1:22 Tommy Jackson and slimecicle Jackson
bruh charlie is the only reason this video amazing 🤣🤣🤣
I DIED OF LAUGHING WHEN THE BH IS SO CLOSE TO THE PORTAL
Did you put just cause 3 music?
W & Cs-Everyone of Tommy's fans are 14 Me- But I'm 12
The way he says 'I'm shacking. I'm building a shack.'
What the fuck lol
The latin sentence really was in latin
"WE GOTTA WUN" im shitting salmon
I wonder if he has installed tinder yet?
YOU LOCATED THE STRONG HOLD! AND WILBUR GOT OBSIDION AND RAILS FROM /GIVE!!!!I JUST REALIZED YOU GOT FOOD TOO!!!AND WILBUR GOT INTO CREATIVE MODE!!AND SLIEMSUOSE
The fact that Wilbur and Charlie consider those songs to be unrecognizable to us 2006’s is an insult to me personally.  Idk about everyone else that i havent been classmates with, all i know is that i know ‘em.
if any of you read this comment, I would like to say. You know how Tommy says he apricates subscribers? well he actually does, every time someone clicks that button he gets more motivated and really appreciates it :D
As usual. Phil a getting the resources and trying to beat the game while everyone else is acting weird, stupid, or just messing around😑
Sus
Tommy in December: thank you guys for 12 million subscribers WHAT?!?
funny
Som o 10
7:07 - it says, "damnation in latin is true" in latin
this just looks very illegal that the black hole is a cirle
4:24 Everyone: Ah shit, here we go again..
Phill  having a good time (what song is that on the background btw when he goes totalle hardcore mode in nether)
you have more subscribers than an entire country's population (Kuwait)
I am 12 and got all of those references
everyone: in the normal world and dying Philza: in the Neather doing everything he can to get ender pearls for the end :>
20:23 me who was born in 2006 and still understood all the references: 😐
If I had Twitch, the first thing I would say is, “ Hey chat, mate, ya ever been sucked into a black hole?”
im 10 not 14 or 18
Gotta say, my favorite thing about this video is getting to jam with wilbur and charlie to early 2000s songs while they die
I'm 12 and know all the songs wilbur and slimecicle sang
I’m a fan
Can I get a shout out
14:24 look at the chat
when charlie said im soooo log the subtites say IF i get sucked in lol
I’m a fan and I’m 10
NO KERSINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
As a 13 year old I got every reference
he  just  said  he   was  almost  at  7.00M subs.............................................. .................................................................. .......................................................................................
0:11 tommy:we are getting close to 7 mil. Me now in 2021 sees 11mil wait what?
For a long time I didn’t know the Doctor bit was a bit. So legit I thought Charlie had a Doctorate for a good 4 months smh.
20:25 I’m not fourteen nor am I sixteen and I’m not eighteen, I am but a wholesome twelve year old
Anybody else notice that phillza went into spectator then creative  in the bottom left?
1:25
I’M GETTING SU-  s u s
me: *watching this in november * if only he knew how many subs he has now..
I’m ten as of watching this
At 5: 83 tommy said my name XD it’s Clementine
“How hard does it pull oooh”
Can you be in hardcore with 5 friends and last one to die wins?
The event horizon has an accelerated growth about a billion times faster
20:28 I’m 11 lol
I wonder if he’s still gonna be like this when he’s 25
Some viewers are thirteen
pov: u watch chat and u notice that he located a fortress when he got in to the nether
did u install tinder ur on 11.1 m subs
Well I'm 30 so yeahhhh
I love how wilbur always ends up becoming really existential before the video ends "I called to the stars and they laughed at me"  Like that's something that i would say in a depressive episode.   Wait is wilbur ok?-
Great video and funny
I expected alot of "Thats what she said" jokes
im 14 and understood all those refrences
in between 20:05 it was the most dramatic scene i have ever seen-
Ima going in a black hole
FEB 27 IS MY BIRTH DAY!!!!                      im using my dad account by the way
C o r n .
tommy put phil in creative
MrBeast Is The King Of Money, And Hell In This Case..
Wow he has 11 mill :•
only alectro vally?Shm.
i swear at the beginning theres a pink sheep
Yooooooooo
So where's the tinder vid Timothy inside of it
the mod could be about dirt and it would be funny
bro i love how wilbur is almost sucked in and all he cares about is clash royale
your toxic I'm slipped under the taste of your poison paradise I'm addicted to you don't you know that you toxic
they keep resetting the timetime if they keep going, i'm gonna have to put a stop to them
im 12 tho
I got the referances
at 7 mins and 51 seconds in you can see tommy putting phil is creative mode and before that phil when into spectator so does that mean they cheat?
The black hole didn’t just kill the men, but the woman, and the children too!
I am 10
Charkie once said he got long then he was gone he got wide and then he died
I was in tears when charlie said going in a black hole
As a 19 year old it was fun hearkng throwback song
I like tommy said wun
Charlie's subtitles went from green to purple to green?
Tommy you already have 14 mill subs
20:06   tommy: i cant even see it  lightning bolt: *makes like to see*  black hole: HELLO THERE  tommy: AAAAAH NONONONO
13:42   umm is wilbur was on creative or............
Wilbur: Some are 14 TommyInnit: Some are 16 and aome are 18 Me: some are 10 :') (me and my friends watch h and are 10)
as a 13 year old all the old song are still stuck in my f cking head you guys made some bad singing voice
The best part is that if a black hole was even on earth it would be gone in minutes😂😂😂
“…and you can unsubscribe.. anytime!”
Tommyinnit:they're not all 14 some are 16 and 18  Me: AND SOME ARE 11
Why is all my sound like 1000 percent bass boosted
I love the P5 battle theme in the background for Philza 😂
1:25 Charlie: I'm going in a black hole
Bring back the age of mule and drugs 💉
Wilbur: They all are 14 *Me being 19*: yes all 14-...
I can finally watch this again:D
Wilbur: What will the viewers dont get if they are all 14? Me, a 14 year old: *gets all references except one or two*
I trust The Black Hole was not in the Nether
Can anyone read wut wilbur said when the subtitles were backwards
Never thought that I would hear halo music on a Tommyinnit video lol
Why is wilbur always on drugs in these
oh Wilbur I was born in 2005 and I understood ever reference you and Charlie made sooooo suck ittttt
There is a mom joke somewhere around here, I just can't wrap my head around it.
Im younger then 14 O_o
4:47 the dialogue colors switched between Charlie and Wilber
"I was in the woods looking for some tasty mud" WHAT? I MEAN LIKE CRAYONS ARE GOOD BUT MUD?
Today I almost committed arson
I love hearing Tommy saying that thay are so close to 7 mil and then now hes at 11 Mil
LIGHTNING STRUCK AT THE PERFECT TIME!!!!!!! 20:05

When Charley says “Oh Jm so LONG” It says “IF I GET SUCKED IN”
7:07 Wilbur Text - Sentence in Latin. This is true Latin. (It was backwards and in Latin, so there you go)
YOURRR TOXXICC IMMM SLLIIPPINNNG UNNDSEEERRRRR!! XD
When your only 12 and you know every song they sang
I love how In almost every mod vids tommy does wilbur and charlie is just in a cult and Phil is just in Dad Mode and Survival mode😂😭
Tommy:I can’t even see it.god:you see it now*thunder*
"My Fig Newtons are soggy" 😂😭 18:58
Phil was in creative
Hahaha 7 mil bet in a year
This is the mod that makes the nether safer than the overworld
the fact that I understood the references Wilbur and smilecicle made, and I’m younger than 14 🤷
Well? U gonna install tinder illegally?
Wilbur: I can’t go out the same way as Charlie. My fallen comrade.  Tommy: IvE MadE SOmE NeW TrOwzErzzzZ
i would just like to note that tommy's final sentence was "Fuck this man"
Do you have a brother tommy called tom
I love how the sensor cocaine but not fuck
‘i’m going to get 10 million subscribers and install tinder, illegally’ aged so well😂😂
Chat: Ph1lzA was slain by iron golem...
MrBeast watching this video, “ They have discovered my secret. My plan to fill the planet with 100 trillion orbeez must now commence.”
This is one of my favorite videos
*IN HERE PUBERTY NEVER ENDS!*
The frick
It said philza sets own gamemode to creative:)
😂😂
At least you still beat the game lol
am i the only who hears "wilbur i have time"? --> 3:41
Not views I mean vids
I love your view Tommy and I'm 9 years old
Wilbur: their all 14  Tommy: some are 16 some are 18  Me: some are 10!
Just Cause 3 music lol
It's so silly how fast the black hole goes towards them-
damnationem latine hoc est verum latine translate to  sentence in Latin that is true in Latin
Omg your channel is growing big I've been a subscriber since 1m
Me being confused how Wilbur got out: “Wha- huh? But how..?”  The spawn point was in it-
7:10 actually translates to :"This sentence is true in latin" Which I find hilarious
Alternative Title: Dr cicle and wilbur experiment while tommy and philza try to SURVIVE a black hole
The black hole also meaning a dead star
I'm 11 :D
Wilbur playing clash royale 😆😆😆
*tommy, Charlie, and Wilbur just boating slowly* *Dadza just doing dad intense things*
I think I've seen this mod somewhere before
I'm 13 and I knew all the references and songs
This was when he was nearly 7m It’s now over 11m
my favorite part has to be michelslimecicle at 1:20
*1:25* CHARLIE IS GODDEMN MICHAEL JACKSON!!!
I'm 11 I understood all those references
Slimecicle: oh well wilburs dead  Tommyinnit: HAHA WHO FKN CARES
11M let’s gooooooo
11 million
I love how everytime philza is involved in one of these mods he always is the one actually making progress while everyone else is like getting sucked in by a black hole
7:08 in this moment, there is a true sentence, if you put you cellphone in a mirror, the letters will be put in order, and its a sentence in latin, if you go in google translate and put "detect language" and put Latin -> english will appear the sentence:   "sentence in Latin that is true in Latin"  if someone was asking: "what is write in that sentence?" here are the answer  Sorry for my bad english, im from brazil
i enjoyed this video
Anyone else notice Tommy going into creative mode at 5:33
Persona music while Phil was in the nether
R.I.P to Charlie and Wilbur. The greatest scientists known to man. Risking their lives for science. They will be truly missed
Tommy just screamed I'm getting su*dies*...
don"t stop make it drop
11 million
Anyone notice Tommy locating the fortress, lol like months later from when I first watched this video and saw it now. And the moment of it happening is 14 : 24 if you want to see it yourself.

Hello
20:28 some of them are 10
Hamilton is the best
14:16 charlie literally talking like a movie villain

Wait..did Tommy install Tinder already?

I’m a fan of TommyInnit and I’m 9-10 years old- and I understand all of these references.. uhhhh-
Wilbur Soot. I am thirteen and I understood every reference.
testcile
"there all fortteen"  im 11,and not aloud to wach this stuff, but i am anyway.  fuck the rules
Ok but can we just talk about how terrifying and perfect timing that was? 20:06
Leave a like if you were here when he hit 11M
i like tommy put phil in god mode
Charlie : what can we say that will absolutely confuse Tommy’s fans?  Both Wilbur and Charlie starts saying and singing random things  Me being a 15 year old : wait I understand all of this tho 😭😂😂
1:24 but can we just appreciate Charlie’s Michael Jackson impression it is lit 🔥🤩
Why did Charlie and Wilbur think that 14 year olds wouldn’t know what Hamilton was?
Literally every funniest mod video. Everyone else: Memes. Philza: I will beat the ender dragon.
DONT STOP MAKE IT POP
Audio is amazing
20:28 lol am 12
DONT STOP- Slimecicle fell out the map WilburSoot fell out the map
Others: I DON'T CARE!  Phil: hardcore is now on
the black hole expanded so fast to the end, and it leaped at wilbur and slimsicle
20:45 my name is Eliza😳😳
7:49 Phil went to spectator and then creative
Noo Phill died to the iron golem😓😢😥😭  3:32
Charlie rapping hamilton made my day
20:55 we have to wun XD
what will actally said: damnationem latine. hoc est verum latine  what he said instead: TODAY WE FILLED A POOL WITH 3 MILLION ORBEEZ!!  yes I did decode what he said DONT ASK WHY
yes
I was born in 2006 and I got all of those references. You fools. You fiends. Try harder
When Tommy couldn’t see it at night and then the lightning crashed and he saw a it, that was high key SICK
NJ ! l,
Final log. In relation: experiment 1006.  The prototype. Coordination and cooperation. As well as the skillset of all other experiments of his type. Though still missing todays event are no doubt in relation to him. His absence was a flaw in the scientific process. Which should have under no circumstances been left unaccounted for. That's why I'm writing this message so that the same mistake wont be made twice. In future experiments we will need to be contained and disposed of in a secure location.  I'm not worried about myself. One breakthrough and I will be back.  We must forge onwards in the name of science. Whether those beneath us understand it or not.  End of-
0:57 wait why is charlie's text purple?
Tommy, slime, and wilbur: *running from certain death* Phil: *doom music* 18:36
Tommy:phil! I don’t like black holes! It’s one of the two things I’m afraid of! Me:at least he’s honest about being afraid
At 18:45 I'm so distracted because of the background music only because I remember it from Persona 5
Tommy: "We're getting close to 7 million subscribers!" Me: *Looks at sub count...* You have 11M subscribers.
phil be vibing and tommy and wulibursoot and charlie
I love the fact out of nowhere tommy justs goes in creative mode 7:50
You have 11 mil subs
Is there a mod that you guys have 200 hearts and you guys need too try die?
i understood all of wilbur’s refrences… i’m 14
my sucking the black hole its seems that Wilbur soot  is screaming help
February Tommy: "We're getting close to 7 million subscribers!" October Tommy: *Laughs in 11 million subscribers"
THIS IS REALLY FUNNY
Oop he thought only 14 years olds watch tommy but I’m 12 and watch him so do my friends lmao
Happy 11 million!
Took me long enough to realise the Black hole in this mod is brighter than Tommy's future.
When Charlie made the rowing pun I literally could only think of his D&D Podcast
Hey tommy
I’m a child not a teen a fucking child and I know everything ur talking about
I’ve seen most of these funniest mod vids
The subtitle in this video is kinda mess up
how is that all of these videos end up with philza doing work and the rest screaming
11 mil subs congrats
Wilbur: whats the most obscur refrence we can make that Tommys fans just wont get so there all 14  Tommy:there not all 14 some are 16 some are 18  Me :im youngr than 14 dose that mean im to young for this 🙄
“It’s large” that’s what she said lmao🤣🤣
20:24 am 13?
every one of these include  Tommy doing nothing productive with charlie  Philza actully trying while the others piggyback off him  Wilber having a dramatic moment and not being able to jump through the portle
Why do you us Halo Music for your mod videos?
Welp, TommyInnit, I'm proud to announce you've actually reached 11 million, so.. we'll just be waiting for you to uh, yk, install tinder to beat this black hole.. illegally.
Why does Charlie look like he’s on his way to a date?
the end portal was clutch
Next video: I ROBBED A BANK AND IT WAS HILARIOUS
20:06
"damnationem latine hoc est verum latine" google translate says.... "sentence in Latin that is true in Latin"  lmao

Fun fact: spaghetification is a real word.
Wilbur tommy and Charly messing around   Philza literally beating the game
Tommyinnit more like Poggerinnit
7:54 tommyinnit set ph1lza's mode to creative mode. wow

RIP Stephen Hawking.
Has Mr. Beast seen this video
the u word is Unity
Why the freak you always say hilarious in your vids?
No one: Me: halo intensifies
guys?????????????????????????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
These videos need their funniness turned down cause I’m lmao all day and all night
me looking if mrbeast commented
Charlie and Wilbur: singing  Tommy: panicking  Phil: beating the game
Watching this @ 10 mill plus subs where’s the tinder tommy, WHERES THE TINDER!
heh funy blak hol
Lmao u can see tommy set philzas gamemode to creative
7:17
Me when wilbur start talk about how youmg Tommys Subscribers are. Me: Wilbur im 11 and watching you b!tch
The end be like: we won, but at what cost?
1:25 6:25 7:08
“I’m going in a black hole” Charlie
Who is gonna remind Tommy that he now has to download tinder🤣
The real violation is that the black hole is a circle
Black hole: *densest thing in the universe* Tommy’s mom: *”are you sure about that?”*
22:07
I like how it plays halo music while there trying to run and beat the game
Tommy Wilbur Charlie running a screaming Philip getting diamonds
Gets sucked up
Tommy ,it’s destroying ahh
Charlie dies: *sad few seconds of mourning* Wilbur dies: "Oh"
tommy: **panic** slimecile: **accepting fate** phil: **grinding his ass off** wil:  ⟟ won :D  (im sorry its just was way wil says “i won” is just- yea-)
I’ve kind of discovered the basic premise of these videos: The first 2mins is just messing around with the mod Then either Wilbur Charlie, Wilbur Tubbo or Tubbo and Charlie start a cult Philza makes incredible progress Wilbur acts like he’s seen the beyond and puts on a voice changer Tommy alternates between the two voice chats and spends time with each group and just messing around
Wilbur predicted the literal future Mr beast if he made a video of the orbeez
The funny part about when they try to make references to stuff we probably won’t know but I know all the references
Philza: only one playing the game  Tommy:cheating every half hour Wilbur and Charlie: just sciencing the crap out of something that defies science
MrBeast's demonic latin comment translates to: "Latin sentence that is true in Latin" 😂😂go editor Larry
1:25
I kept mistaking the persona music for bleach music and uhh… yeah…
Sorry that black whole is my shit! It turned black because I had really bad explosive diarrhea 😫
"Let's make a reference so obscure Tommy's fans won't understand." "ELIZAAAAA~"
Wilbur increased, then he ceased.
I’m 9 Wilbur. Uh.
Im 15 and I know every song they have been saying-
Bish im 13 im quite offended
Wilbur and Charlie trying to make references 14 year old won’t get Me a 14 year old, getting every refreance.
2:03 that’s what she said
Meeee gustaaaaa!
wilbur: lets make an obscure reference none of tommy's fans understand Me: *BOPPING TO THEM CUZ I KNOW ALL OF IT*
13:44 that was actually existentially terrifying
"well would you look at that"
I love Michael Jackson hehe I can do the moon wallk n I can do hehe like Michael Jackson
why do you guys use op ?
Hmmmmm I think Mr beast got sucked from an oorbeez and became God of void hell.
21:28 Phil PHIL!!!!
rlcraft rlcraft rlcraft rlcraft rlcraft rlcraft
21:22 - Wilbur: DONT STO- it got my crackin up hard
20:33 Those are all songs I grew up with. I’m 17. :)
You can never escape the *BLACK HOLE!*     You cannot run and you cannot hide! >:D
10:06 FAKER LIAR STUPID CREATIVE USERS
You beat the game with no armor????? Now THAT is PogChamp
It’s tinder time
7:04-7:18 Wilbur’s claims are false what it actually translated to is “damnationem latine, hoc est verum latine” don’t know what it means but I know it didn’t translate to what Wilbur claimed it to
When they sang tic tok me:  AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH DUDE STFU
Charlie: 🎶I'mA GoInG In A BlACk Hole😌🎶
Every one they have a new mod    Tommy and Charlie: messing with the mod and dying like 10 times  Wilbur and Philza: actually trying to survive
Is that………….. a … circle
Tommy at the start of the video: we added the black..., skip 10 second’s in and you’ll hear Wilby wheezing
*I’m 12 and I understand most of these references*
Bruh in the beginning the black hole was small and then like in 2 minutes it’s huge
2006? HOW- TOXIC? BITCH I KNOW THAT
I love your vids tommyinnit bitch
The blackhole epic showed up 20:06
I'm 10
Big innit over here bouta  hit 11 mil. He'll yeah dude
9:07
Am I the only 13 year old who knows literally all of the stuff we aren't supposed to know according to Wilbur and Charlie??
Do another black hole video where really funny
Tommy innit: i will get ten million subscribers, and will install tinder.. illegally Me: have you done it yet?
I’m 11 and I watch Tommy :(
This video defines “seeing is believing”
Offincive im 9!
Every time When Tommy made a mod video philza is just hard working person
Charlie and will really think us q4 year olds won’t know those songs-
20:35 Ha! Little do you kno I may be 13 but I was basically born in the '90's. So. Ha! Jokes on you, 'cos I kno all of those songs!
Black hole init
Actually you DID beat the challenge for once
Will and char are a team scienceticed
Me a 25 y/o TommyInnit fan, uuuuuhhhhhhhh
for all those wanting to know what willbur said in the "lating tounge" part he said: bamnationem latinel hoc est verum latinel       idk i used translator..and this is the result Latin bamnationem hoc is Latin verum
Did he lash you with a 1million dolar golden whip? #nocontext
22:08 why is this making me laugh so hard
Tommy, you have 10 mil now, where's tinder?   This is a joke by the Way lol
at 14:26 does anyone see the FOSSILS?!?! (if you don't know there are 4 nether fossils and 4 overworld fossils and i see 3 of the nether fossils which is INSANE)
xD the way cicle just: if the black hole comes more towards me… i will be very long and.. die
Wilbur : i have seen everything. Me: ………then how do u make a lesbian ?
Did anyone else see when Tommy made philza creative mode
Its only been 7 monds  and he grew 3 million
7:51 7:56 POV: a cringey robox roleplay some children do
1:56 u can see he failed whit command lol
Im not even 14 yet
The songs they sang tho🤩😌
Oh fuck man Dr circle ....I didn't think they'd last that long too tbh
I’m 14?
"The most stressed i been in my life was when my Clash base got raided" I really hate myself for relate to this xD it didn't matter if i had two OP King Dave barbarian and a OP hawk eye girl, everytime i sleep my base gets drained
If Borgar-san got revived by Mistah Beast and his Wrapped Car, then how Wilbur did escape from espagethifiedness? Don't tell me it was the eggs that revived Wilbuh xD
If Biggu Quacko was here, he would dress as Hulk Hogan and wrestle Blackhole-chan before realizing Eggs do go in
Tom,y did you get this from dream and George?
22:10 i love this moment where Wilbur just insulted the Dragon like a 3rd grader XDD
HOW DID WILLBUR GET OUT OF THE BLACK HOLE?!?!?!?!
Rick and morty? I only watch Willbur and Charlie B)
I love how in every one of these types of videos that Phyl (However you spell it XD) just casually grinds for diamonds and other things and has a ton of things while everyone is just running for there lives 😆
It has been 8 months and I just realized this was posted on my birthday! lol
Hm I saw that mode on Dreams channel, but your black hole looks way more dense. Was it updated? Btw watching this this was fun
Istg whenever I feel sad or upset I just watch Tommy's videos, they're hilarious and always makes me happy! :D
7:44
You’re forgetting about me who is 20 so yes I do know all those references
20:06 " i can't see it " later you look it like a ghost hahaha
That part where the lightning struck behind the black hole was horrifying
Charlie: I'ma goin in a blackhole
Tommy: No some of my subs are 12, 16, 18 Me: exuse me tommy i’m 10 am i not a valid subscrider?!
One thing when Philza trade with the piglens ther was blaze rods and he is looking for sum
Pog
I just noticed the black hole with a circle that's illegal AAAAHHHHHHHHHhHHHhHHHHhHhHHHHHHHhH
HAPPY 10MIL TOMMY
14:24 umm... What am I seeing?
7:55 you can see in the screen corner ph1lza was on creative
Tommy Charlie and wilber not doing much and kinda being stupid  philza grinding and just beating the game
I'm sorry what was that 5:39 umm I thought this was survival
Philza is always in Tommys mod videos to actually progress
ah
Mr beasg:Damnationem latine ,hoc est verum latine
tommy just said IT's SUCKING
That’s the last time the background look like you was orbiting a black hole on earth
One of my siblings are 11 and watch you and get some of these songs and stuff :p
I like black holes
Stonks turned into suc
Wilbur was singing daft punk
at this point I'm subbed to both your channels. You are honestly so cool. May you keep making the funniest stuff known to man.
tbh did he install tinder illegally cause it seems he's at 10 mil when this is commented
Not me being 14 and knowing everything Wilbur and Charlie referenced
Okay
e
e
e
e
Dude Charlie should be the next Michael Jackson
Wilbur, you failed to make a reference i didn't understand
6:20 hahahah
Tommy: you are my favourite youtuber. Wilbur,Charlie: WHY DO YOU JUST MESS AROUND IN EVERY F*QUACK*ING VIDEO!?!?
He said some are 14 some are 16 some are 18. Me: but how about my twelve year old nephew
3:33 philza was slaon by golem
“It’s like we”re moonwalkin’-“ “HEE-HEE OH AH AAAAAAH” *dies* *Micheal Jackson mode activates* “Imma goin’ in a black hole”
spadeadified
Alternative title: Phil does all the work while Tommy checks in on him and Wilbur and Charlie (who are conducting science)….. Oh yeah there’s a black hole too!
Pilhza is just in every video he is gaming
Hi I’m 12 and I know all the references that Wilbur and Charlie were saying lol  And let me say when they were singing tik tok I had to sing with them

7:55 what is that in the chat huh?
Wilbur: um straight dead im- oh. I see the stars 🧚‍♀️🧚‍♀️
7:51 tommyinnit set ph1lza gamemodd to creative lol
"I called for the stars and they laughed at me." My brain: And I took it as a taunt
I can’t be the only one that saw Wilhersoot turn into survival mode in chat?
I love the way charlie and wilbur just bounce off of each other
hi
Wilbur: I've seen into the blackened eye of the event horizon there were no screams I called to the stars and they laughed at me Charlie: Tommy: Tommy: You wanna shoot hoops with us?
hi im 11,    should i be here?    eh idc hes funny
I LEARNT THE WORD SPAGETTIFIED AND THE MEANING IN YEAR 3
Tommy Here: WE SO CLOSE TO 7 MIL      Tommy Now: *Laughs in 10 mil*
The pekka: PAN-CAKES!
hey clash of clans 😁
I  can't wait to get hilariously plunged into the dark void of space
Where’s the tinder vid
19:30 I won
I like how philza is just casually in the nether trading with piglins while the others are playing around near the black hole LMAO
Lol when Philza’s beating up nether mobs with intense background music.  Tommy: “Oh look Wilbur, there’s the polar bears.”
Am I the only one that’s younger than 14 and still knows all the references Wilbur and Charlie made
“Fish are literally being sucked from the water infront of me” Sally: 😳
Wilbur: they won’t understand  Me: *Understand ever song*
“Were so close to 7 million subscribers” well that aged well
4:12 hmmnnm??? When tho
I got half the refranses that Wilbur and Charlie
I can’t turn off the captions
Tommy why did you not say suck my nuts there was an apurtunaty my spelling is shit
The sentence in Latin is true in Latin Bamnationem latine hoc est verum latine
Imagine mr beast seeing this video

Tommy: My viewers are 16,17....... Me: I'm 10 years old
When they said some fans are 14 and 16 but some of them are 10
Oh my

4:07 well we’re waiting
"I called to the stars I said 'can I have a 10 piece mcnugget and French fries?' They laughed at me
Don't mind me, just watching Tommy videos instead of doing my homework that I can get in big trouble for me not doing it
I actually thought my network got sucked into the black hole from how bad it is
The best YouTubeer
20:06
The only reason philza is in these videos is they can actually beat it
:)
Is it just me who was singing along with Wilbur and Charlie?
I know those songs because my mom lol🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
21:49 That is the scariest thing i have ever seen
20:36 LOL
“TODAY, WE FILLED A POOL WITH THREE MILLION ORBEEZ, AND WE’RE GOING TO BE JUMPING IN AND FINDING SALVATION!”  This bit makes me laugh so hard all of the time.

What Wilbur’s subtitles said in latin: Damnation em latine hoc est verum latine  English:Damnation em in Latin this is true in Latin  I also translated the: TODAY WEVE FILLED A POOL WITH ONE MILLION ORBEEZ AND WE’RE GONNA BE JUMPING IN AND FINDING SALVATION  Hodie piscinam uno miliones orbeeze replevimus et insiliendo et salutem inveniendo ibamus
I constantly come back to these types of videos just because they're so funny
The intense halo music lmao
Massive black hole ;)
The black hole in 0.65 seconds
1:25 amazing singer
Who else wasn't born when wilbur was making the referencess but still understood them ;-;
Wilbur... Wilbur just dies
Why was that video age restricted and not the dragon one ?!
Wilbur practically starts cults or something every time.
Slimecicle: Micheal Jackson Eee Hee *instantly dies*
I love how Wilber played clash Royale instead of CoC
Sub or ill make you eat the great omelet of the beyond
I’m am 10 so fuck it
Wilbur is habds down the best philosopher to ever exist
Tommy:it looks like we’re moonwalking Charlie:HEE HE dies
I love rewatching these
PHILZA IS THE ONLY ONE TRYING 😂😂
The music at the end fit so well
p5 music = my like and sub

20:27 “Tommy’s fans will not understand” Literally every Tommyinnit fan: *singing and laughing at references aggressively* Edit: WHAT DOESNT KILL ME MAKES ME STRONGER is the actual lyrics, Wil. Unless there are two doppelgänger songs
Tommy Wilbur and Charlie just doing random shit the whole vid.  Philza gets everything
tommy is the  best youtuber
lol
When tommy just says ‘Philll’ it’s adorable
"CHICKENS- LAY YOUR LAST EGGS MY FRIENDS- LAY YOUR LAST EGGS-!" This is by far the funniest shit ive ever heard a 17 year old say
20:56 Captions: we gotta wun *"Run", not "wun"*
the references slime and wil are making i get because i grew up on Just Dance 2....
Still waiting for him to instal tinder…
Fun Fact:In most of tommyinnit's mod videos philza is the one doing all the grinding and stuff
I just realized that a black hole   Sucks us to death
Mr beast being god,.
Btw for context some of this was staged lol, if you look closely at around 11 mins or so tommy types a command where the nether fortress spawns closer- But its still really hillarious and this video was amazing!
Tommy visit dream in jail and record it
*" Hee-Hee "* *" I'ma goin in a black hole "*
Charlie, Wilbur, and Tommy: *boat ride* Philza: *Persona 5 music*
That was such a mood change tommy went we are safe then he went we’re fucking dead lol
Congrats on 10 mill :D
It’s a cirkel 😱
Tommy:Some are 18 some are 16 Me:Some are 11
Slimecicle's 'ELIZA' and Wilbur's 'Imma get a scholarship to kings college' made me laugh We need more Wilbur and Charlie singing Hamilton songs
7:06 Held my phone up to the mirror and used google translate on this lol Damnationem latine = Latin sentence Hoc est verum latine = this is true in Latin  Damnationem latine hoc est verum = this sentence is true in Latin Damnation latine hoc est verum latine = sentence in Latin that is true in Latin  Obviously you can’t really on google translate for a perfect translation but I though it was cool
7:07 he sownd like venom
When I watch your videos & u laughing I feel slightly less empty
warthog run is great in the background
im 11
Say no less youve already got 10 mil!
Welcome back to another episode of phil beating the game,the others goofing off and wilbur starting a cult.
Lol u can see Tommy setting Phil to creative mode
I like how Tommy can't see the black hole then lightning appears like a tunnel of doom
You're a bit loud
“There not all 14, Some are 18, some are 16”  Me being 10:
Me 12 years old and understanding all of the references: YOU CAN'T FOOL ME BITCHES! 😈😈
I need to know why Halo music was playinh
I’m 13 and I understood half those references that Charlie and Wilbur did XD

Oh. My. God. Why is it that every video with Charlie and Wilbur they are literally in their own worlds 😂 And then you got Tommy and Phil trying to beat the game
I love how in these videos everyone always messes around then Phil is just in the caves getting dimonds!
im just going to wait patiently for tommy to install tinder... illegally
At 7:08 the subtitles say: "damnationem latine, hoc est verum latine".
0:54 charlie got the wrong color
I’m 14 simping over a 16 year old-
Charlie will always be remembered

Tommy I think you need water bec your voice is like a tricky from Friday night funkin when you scream dude

10m subs huh? Tinder is on your way XD
14:10 wrong subtitles lul

When Wilbur said it was infinitely small I think he meant the singularity which is infinitely dense
The part where they run to the portal to save theyre lives reminds me of that one gametheory
Get tinder now
the three: b l a c k  h o l e  Philza: lets fucking go dude
Is it bad that I'm almost 15 and get all the references that Wilbur and Charlie said

Comedy, the channel
Today we filled a pool with three milion orbeez and were going to jump in it and find salvation.

Hi
"What's a reference that Tommy's viewers wouldn't get?"  Me, who literally grew up with 20s - 2000s music out of pure interest and family influence: try me bitch, I dare you.
22:05 _[Slimecicle: set own game mode to Creative Mode]_
*A Black Hole which can devour the whole planet*  **Gets called the funniest mod**
Some of the viewers is like 11 years old too btw not me
wtf?!?! why is this age restricted?!?!
Tommyinnits "what" should be his signature catchphrase
👍🎮😄😆🕳️🕳️👈🦾
I’ve seen Charlie before he was on some other Youtubers channel I forgot what the name was called cause I haven’t watched it like a year but basically they had to sneak candy on to a movie theater I don’t know if you remember that though
Whatever Tommy do, I love the photo of the channel
Why is it age restrictriced
Philza carried xD
TOMMY HAS PREDICTED THE FUTURE HE SAID 10 MIL SUBSCRIBERS!!!!
I UNDERSTAND THE TOXIC REFERENCE BECAUSE I PLAYED JUST DANCE 2 FOR FIVE YEARS FUCJ YEAH
Hello

clash of clans pog
Am i tripping or is this video age restricted?
Wow
Why do I have to verify my age to watch this??!??!?
Fun fact: YouTube thinks that Tommyinnit is a innapropriate content
Do a white hole and a black hole where it randomly teleports u
The why Tommy said “ Wilbur?” 19:47

The video is now age restricted:((
Charlie he heed  the life out himself
I didn't thought that they would beat the game
I am 11 but I know all of these
tommy cant even watch his own video now this is a sa day
You is gived philza creative is typed i chat if wilbur died
Charlie and Tommy: *Calling each other "bro" and "brother"*  Me: I can just hear Wilbur getting jealous.
How did a tommy innit video become age restricted
19:54 "thats my level 9 ice wizard for you" 😂😂😂😂😂😂
19:32 I like how wilbur just wins a clash royale match during a serious disaster 😂😂😂😂😭😭
1 day before the blackhole Me: We Need to be "wise" Like "Ph!lza"
14:10 oops, thats a long typo there XD
I resonate with the songs being sung because I was around when they were first popular
why is it age restrcted thats just dumb
how every single tommyinnit mod video goes  tommy: loudly stressed  wilbur: reached some sort of enlightenment  charlie:  no idea what’s happening/not taking this seriously  philza: grinding on the other side of the map
It was epic when… WHEN… W H E N . . .    ⬇️    I sold my soul to mr beast
This was like an actual movie, good job tho :D
“Male chickens, don’t lay eggs.”    there’s no such thing as a male chicken. It’s called a rooster.
For me the vid is age restricted :)
no one mentioned That the Black hole is round.
I'm 12 and understand most of the songs🤣

“ I SPOTTED THAT WITH MY EARS “
"i've seen into the blackened eye of the event horizon. there is no screams. i called to the stars and they laughed at me.   "you wanna shoot hoops w/ us? :D"  "our lives are fleeting. when that there ball expands, there's gonna be nothing left"
My dog name is celitime
So!e are 14 some are 16 some are 18 😂 I started watching you since I was nine 😂 don't worry I'm 15 😯
*let’s do something Tommy’s fans won’t understand* Me: 👁👄👁
Bro if you take the things Wilbur said in "Latin" and flip it, it translates to "English sentence that is true in Latin." Just a quirky little detail by the editors I guess.
You gonna install tinder yet tommy?
Everyone is so mean to Jean, dont even call her by her name
Like Phil's hardcore music while in the nether
Me: is younger than tommy Me: also knows all the songs    Hol tf up
And some are 9

14:10 slime said this line earlier  This happens alot
I like how much the cheat 🤣
wilbur is the greatest story teller  along with being a maniac
Omg 14 yr olds would be born in 2007 not 6 bahahahha
20:30 jokes on you, I lived in those songs
I like how philza's having a great time while tommy and the rest are getting sucked    "Your a bish and you got no fans" is a freaking masterpiece✨
Philza's having a great time
5 month and 10m subs, me having Channel 1 year 10 subs -_-
Ah yes tommy fans are all 14:  *IM 12 AND I KNOW THOSE SONGS THAT THEY WERE SINGING*
20:37 that's Stronger by Kanye West. I love that song. Unless it's something else, and I've just made a fool of myself.
Congrats on 10m subs
i love how intense things got when they are, going to the portal
tommy:some are 16 some are 18 me:some are 10
Let Jesus Christ be with you all amen and amen
ARE WE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW THAT TOMMY SET PHILZA TO CREATIVE
HOW CHARLIE WAS TRYING TO BE MICHEAL JACKSON THO "ima going in the black hole " its at uh 1:25
He screamed like a girl 🤣🤣🤣🤣
i just realized they used the music from jc3
Will: it’s red and hot   Me😳... welp he in hell
17:26 - Ph1Lza Speedrunning - The Others having a boat race 20:57 - Tommy Stressed Af - Wilbur and Charlie Having a party
https://youtube.com/clip/UgylwckjZg4AzY8nrjR4AaABCQ
im 14 and knew all the songs they sang
im rewatching this and now i realize how annoyed i am dr sicle and wilbur making fun of us for not knowing these songs
philza: literally being doomslayer   tommy,slime and wilbur: hitting on polar bears
I love how Philza is speed running the game with intense Persona music in the background, and everyone else is talking about oldgame references.
The blocks getting sucked in reminds me of the wither storm!.
Tommy: my viewers are 14 to 18 Me being 10: I am God
English sentence that is true in latin
lets goo
Fun fact spaghettified is an actual term.
I'm twelve and I got all of those refrences
They have a cockpit too!
Loved it
18:40 persona music
Theres a black hole eating the Earth and destroying the Solar System  Wilbur: clash royale
Why were you guys cheating
"We gotta wun" -Tommyinnit
I love your videos
20:45 Charlie Slimecicle said my name but I know it is in a song from Hamilton but still
I can finally say i was here before 10mil
Godspeed dr. Cicle
when you're 11 and understand all the references they made:
Charlie and Wilbur seem to have an unhealthy relationship. One of them always ends up sacrificing themselves to the arms of Satan.
I now know why Mr. Beast is his name.
I was in the same seed that tommy found the lava
Slimecelie: in hear puberty never ends tommyinnit: FUCK GOB PHIL GO FUCKING GO GO GO GO
This is not how black holes work I'm crying it so off reality I'm just soo rrg
summary of the funny mod videos  philza: trying to complete the game wiblur and charlie: doing stupidly funny bits tommy: stuck in the middle
hand on a second, didn't tommy have 9 million subs just yesterday??
the sadist part is that they beat the game but still died:(
Space is very racist  Why not white hole or brown?  (Disclaimer this is a joke)
14:24 pause there tommyinnit is doing the /locate fortress you can see in chat
so......you're implying that mr.beast is the lord of hell
The black balls
a black hole the size of a penny would just go in the middle of earth and eat it up lul
I'm 12
Philza is just living his life in tge nether 😂😂
Does anyone know how he gets server whit mods that friends can join
The mod isn't funny it's their banter
Tommy asking "what do you mean im suckin" im dying 1:04
It's funny how they made a mr beast cult and I'm willing to join
Oof
Hey guys so I actually found out that what will said in quote-unquote Latin was backwards so I played the video and I put a mirror in front of it and I wrote down what it said and then I went into Google translate and I translated the doubt and don't want to some which was the first line Latin says Imperium second line was howis Veron and it says this is true so the full line that he said quoted Mr Beeson how was Imperium this is true
everyone:dying,running away trying to save their pity lives  phil:mm diamnd.
I think I mean 10k
Wilbur: all your fans are 14, lets make references they won’t understand: sings early 2000s songs Us: You do realise we had a childhood…
Tommy, when you are too tired to search for a fortress and just do like /locate fortress (14:24)
**Everyone runs away from Black hole** Slimecicle : _he-Hee_ towards the black hole
7:51 philza was in creative, check in chats
Why did tommy set phil into creative mode?
4:13
20:33 _vibes in twelve but has know these songs my whole life_ (IK THIS SOUNDS LIKE THE MOST ANNOYING THING BUT PLS DON’T COME AT ME-)
14:10 i n t e r e s t i n g     s u b t i t l e s
Hm...   [Tommyinnit: set Ph1LzA's gamemode to creative]   Sussy amogus SUs
Looking for some tasty mud

Wilbur is like a NPC in a game kill it it comes back
I’m  watching this 5 months late and he said I’m so close to 7 mill and now he’s at 10 mill he got 3 mill more subs in five months
Child, autotune man and autotuneman fan: messing around Kisuke: *dream speedrun music intensifies*
Tommy: **saying the dragon has no fans** My Ender Dragon-inspired character: *Allow me to introduce myself*
Anybody remember when jen and pat did mods like this?
Wilbur there a black hole looks at pig, techno blade coming in with the speed running music
0:07 what- Wilbur? Wilbur: dies
You said you have two things you’re scared of, then what’s the other one????
Phill the only one doing serious stuff

I like how Wilbur and Charlie were singing older songs thinking we don’t know them, but I was singing with them cuz my mom played all of those songs
Ok tommy its time to download tinder illegally please record it

7:55 [TommyInnit: Set  Ph1LzA's game mode to creative mode]
My favourite part: 5:01
if Wilbur saw hell, did he also see Lil Nas X?
RIP Slimecicle. We shall never forget his last words…”HeE hEe”

4:40 The CC's colours got messed up lol
What’s that intense music that you used?
All of Tommy’s fans are 14  Me:I am like 10

The music playing when they are in the nether is from Just Cause 3. It plays when you are being chased by the militia
Ok y'know what.. Im Younger thatn 14... And i know all of the refrences.....

Not everyone is 14,16 or 18 I'm 10
everyone that have watched the flash serie: slimecicles kinda look like dr wells
21:34 this is like an movie
The funny thing is I know all those songs and I'm 15
The black hole is sucking up the entire world and Phil is getting diamonds       💎 w💎
The thunder....was timed so well when he said "i can't see it" *thunder* "Ahhhh"
i feel offended that Slimecicle thought i wouldn't know about Hamilton-

Hahaha guess what will and charlie I got every single one if those song references and I'm 13!!! Hahahaahahahab
Me being 13 and knowing  all the songs

20:06 Horror movies be like

Philza: *actually doing something*  Tommy, Wilbur and Slime: *acting like its a normal day when there is a black hole that is gonna suck everything up*
I'm just wondering they could've crafted a bed and set a spawn point so u don't spawn in a black void🤔

Hi tommyinnit
The fact that I myself who is a 14 year old has the knowledge of knowing the references that weren’t designed for us 14 year old flesh and boned beings makes this so amusing
Tommy! You hit 10M! Time to install Tinder!
7:08
Tommy’s titles for almost every video:  ____ Mod was incredibly funny
I am 11 and I know each song that the sang.
Wilbur: doctor cicle I feel something try- trying to take over me.... me: EMO OMG

when you get all the references that they were saying: *vibe check passed* 😎💅
Um so they used a lot of commands if you didnt see lol they used /locate nether fortus XD it was funny tho
some or 18 respect and he forgot some or 10
Having Phil’s theme music being boss fight music from Persona and Wilbur Tommy and Charlie’s theme being nintendo music is the most accurate thing i’ve heard
phil is always the guy beating the game while the others are messing around
21:53 tommy really went lore mode right here
and tommy now has 10MiL subs so he can install tinder illegally
damnationem latine hoc est verum latine  Wilbur said

I'm 12
Wilbur: Charlie what's a reference that we can make that Tommy's fans will not understand? They're all 14 so they were probably born in 2006  Me: Born in 2007, understood all references (especially the Hamilton one)
The songs they song and said we were all at least 14, I'm younger than 14, I knew them all wilbur you are wrong
I am 9.
Am i the only one that noticed Phil went to creative?
At 7:49    Ph1LzA went spectator
7:56 "Set Ph1lzA'game mode to Creative Mode" Caught in 4K 🤨📸
20:27
Am 111111, not 14 Wilber soot , i am immortal , i was here when Rome was created , i was here when it was destroyed , i was here when u were conceived , i will be here when ur whole genartion dies , i will be here forever , completely alone with my thoughts when the stars die and the black holes decay , i will be here when the last atom losses its shit  I will *ALWAYS* be here

Spagethified, He got wide, then He died. Lmao this killed me xD
Literally any mod vid ever: Philza: *Actually tries to survive* Tommy: Either helps phil or fucks around with wilbur and charlie Wilbur: Does some deep shit Charlie: Also does some stupid deep shit

You can install da tinder now to delete da HOLE
Tommy : F Wilbur : F Charlie : F  Philza : Sprint dude lets f*cking go.
Wait.....       Your ten million now.... WHERES YOUR TINDER VIDEO?!?
Then I came up to the window with the sonde of prosciutto 🎵🎵
nobody:   Tommy's mod videos: Philza: The one who randomly disappears and comes back with diamonds.  Wilbur: Making everything a story.  Charlie: Included in the story  Tommy: The concerned child    Idk
I like how philza was the only one trying to play the game 100%

i was singing with them and im young...-ish😀😅😂
Rip Charlie😔🤚
Warthog Run from Halo 3 still gives me chills, even in this context

TOMMY
Everyone: *Enjoying the video* Me: *Vibing to some of the halo songs*
Whoa that's cra-  ...

When Charlie died the halo theme almost made me cry o-o
DIE FOR SCIENCE as the halo theme intensifies lol
TOMMY,FIGHT THE BLACK HOLE!!
tommy can now finally execute his 3 step plan
LOL
the fact i was born in 2007 and i knew every single reference wilbur and charlie said and sang along
Wilbur thinking 14 year olds don’t know Britney Spears or Kesha is killing me!
i'm 13 and i got all of those references
When they get in the nether Chat: the fortress is at -320... Above is where they forgot to put the on camera mining off camera
Why was wilbur so poetic
Well, now he does have 10 million subscribers. is he gonna illegally install tinder now?
No one:      *Philza just peacefully working*
im 11 and im a very big fan
Wilbur put the Ghostbur Voice on
Umm Tommy you have 10 million subs…
21:29 One of the most intense moments that Tommyinnit encountered
As a 15 year old I still understood every reference Charlie and wilbur made
Phil: playing the game Tommy,Wilbur and slime: making whole entire love story…
Did tommy use creative ,time 5:33 on the video
Every mod video philza is like speedrunning
Well Tommy Wilbur and charlie on a boat trip Phil du du du du du du du
(Little funny tommyinnt meme) tommy: hey guys i found some iro- Ph1lza has made the achivement “cover me in debris”
Tommy and phil: speed running Wilbur and charlie: “studying” the black hole
Well it's time to set up your tender account
“I need to get 10million subs and download tinder…. *Illegally* .” Lol
Did u notice that phill got put in creative
“I can’t even see it!” Lighting: *KKDJWIJFJEKSIWOBBYK” Tommy: **screams of distress and terror**
I'm 9
20:43 ELIZAAA-
When your 10 and your family doesnt even care what you watch: Welp.

18:45 Tommy, Wilbur, and Charlie are in danger whil Phil is vibin
F go they
Me being 11 getting all there references 👁👄👁
“HeeHee” -Slimecicle’s last words :(
Whenever they make modded vid lng this philza always do everything 😂
Most intense moments: 20:05 5:31 6:19 (that was just creepy) 7:19 RUN FOR YOUR FUKING LIFE 7:43 *Has Wilbur been possessed? I mean, I can always kick out the black hole but that’s less fun then making Wilbur lose his fucking mind over my voice* 13:38 He fucked up 19:15 RUN FOR YOUR FUKING LIFE part 2 21:25 part 3?
You said you would install tinder at 10 mil I still don't see it.
Step 2 tommy, go download tinder for you've hit 10 mil
Tommy: "It's obsidian! It's the strongest block in game!"     Bedrock: am I a joke to you?
Tommy: what do you mean your ‘suckin’  Charlie: *silence with a smile*
**sings** ima going in a black hole
If someone is reading this then I hope you have a good day :)

“I just wanna say man i just WAAAAH”                                   -Wilbur soot 2021 8:20
Tommy... i watched Aphmau play this.. Both utter DESTRUCTION
Who is washing this a 10 million subs
black holes dont increase by size without a different black hole but ok
i died while wathing this
"Look man, i went for particle physics no biology, so i dont know- i dont know when he's gonna fuck the egg or whatever"  I cracked right open XD
Me who is 12 and got The reference: *IT’S TOUGH TO BE A GOD*
2:04 tommyinnit: it seems like it has actually grown. Me: that's what she said
5:05 perfect acting skills
Most words here have “wrong” labeled on them when put together in a certain order
Wilbur: all his followers are 14 Me: huh I’m 10
9:53  "charlie give a juju"   every skyblock non ever
Later while tommy gets 10mil  He didn’t download tinder
born in 2008  knows all the songs will and charlie were singing: F**K YEAH IM BETTER THAN ALL YOU B- *fifthharp fell out of world
It was more of a science or computer class
The mr beast video
What would happen if MR BEAST figures out that you called him Hell
1:25 who else hears Imma goin' in a f* hole instead I'ma going in a black hole
**A blackhole is coming**  Phil: *finding diamonds in the mine*
Toxic I GOT THE REFERENCE FOOL
It said philza went to creative mode
20:35 it’s frickin toxic by Britney Spears and I am more idiotic then tommy  To clarify it’s a joke and tommy is coool
16:08 is that Just Cause 3 music???
14:25 lol look in the bottom left corner
Tommy:"when I get 10 million subscriber's I will install twitter ileaglely" well you have 10 million now.
Mr.innit this vid is very funny who cares what all them haters say😝🖐️
MrBeast is a Fraud
No offense tommy but Dream posted this first… not being a a hater I freaking think ur great just saying also if I could play a game with u that would be great
4:10 waiting for a vid: "I installed Tinder and it went hilarious"
5:54 "Let's go do basketball and drugs"
How do people sub if they don't know about your channel?
I love how Phil actually plays the game while the others play with the black hole 😂
Boy black hole mode holy shit
14:25 if you can see in the corner tommy cheated
I got all of them songs that Wilbur and Charlie sang and I'm 2006
so when are you going to install tinder Tommy?
you need to find a mod that you dont have to leave the never
22:05 look at chat
21:23 Wilbur and slimesiccle went to creative mode😱
14:10 is that text meant to say that????
11:50 you... you spotted that with.. your... ears?
1:22 some Michael Jackson stuff
20:06 a living nightmare
Me how know what they are referring to and I’m 9 so yea
@Mrbeast
"He went wide and then he died"  -Charlie 2021
Mr beast: I ADDED THE BLACK HOLE MODE TO MY CITY!
“GO TO THE FORTRESS WHERE IS IT”    14:25 CHEATERR    {edit} (look at the chat)
when you aren’t 14, 16, or 18 and still understand all the references
When the lightning struck the black hole ⚫ looked so scary
4:05 - Ight wheres the tinder video mate
I just want to pray to my god allah
I can't get over how similar you sound top Daniel radcliffe
MrBeast watching this like 👁️👄👁️🤨
He has ten million
Male chickens dont lay eggs, why you calling it a “hhHhHeEeEe”   -Wilbur Soot 2021
5:03 I SWEAR IT LITERALLY KILLED ME
The sentence about the pool with orbeez in Latin:  “Hodie impleta est nobis in stagnum III million orbeez et amet non inveniendo insulturam et salus”
Dangerous"
Wait.... Now he has to install tinder illegally!!!!
At one point charlis text was purple insted of green 0:55-1:03
I'm 10
why did the word from charile at the start is the text from wilbur!? is it a problem or is it wibur?
Why Did Dreadslime And MrSoot Change Colors
did tommy do /locate?
You can hear the fear in Tommy's void started chasing him 21:28
the only time they actully beat the game during a mod video
lol error in chat charlie is purple and will is green xD
20:35 i was singing with willbur and slimecicle and i was laughing to death  srry i now this was posted 4 months ago
Lol 10 mil now
fond this but has anyone else spotted it 10:08
Pause at 5:32 they cheated
16:04 THE JUST CAUSE MUSIC OH MY FUCKING GOD THE MEMORYS HOLY SHIT MAN
its getting old that wilbur expiriences a 'traumatic' expirience and goes insane
“Im gonna get 10 million subscribers and instal tinder illegally” Well that’ll be an interesting video. Waiting on it.
And some are 11
1:23 XD WHY
...
Tommy: "Looks like we're moonwalking!" Charlie: "HEE HE- " *dies*
14:23 he located a fortress
IN HERE PUBERTY NEVER ENDS  Slimecicle: 2021
lol tommy ig you have to get tinder now COMGRATS ON 10 MILLIONN
Did anyone see tommy cheat
He he 1:21
I am 12 and I understood every reverance
TommyInnit: "some are 16, some are 18" me: I am nine
10 million views and has 10.1milsubs
THIS VID HAS A 10M VIEWS!!
the cha be like "WiLbUrSoOt FeLl OuT ThE wOrLd" Over and over
Wilbur and Charlie underestimated tommy's fans, we knew all the references
He’s got the 10 million subs, does that mean he’s gonna instal tinder *illegally* ?
Anybody realise that Tommyinnit did /locate fortress in 14:24
to be honest, that is fucking terrifying
Why does wuilber feel the need to connect to the spirit world in every video
I saw tommy use /locate
21:44 to 21:54 what an action movie type tense moment especially the incredible escape into the end and how tommy and almost everyone evaded the black hole by the skin of their teeth
Am I the only one that heard the Just Cause 3 battle music when Charlie was changing his render distance?
14:24 HAHAHAHAH GOTTEM HE CHEATED LOL
Erm tommy cant you and phil stay in the nether so theres no black hole i mean you can get netherite?
In pretty much all of tommys modded videos one or more of them have used creative mode if you pay attention.
At 14:24 look in the chat.... TOMMYINNIT IS A CHEATER
Congrats on 10 Mill
For how much we can laugh, Wilbur is an absolutely amazing actor and you can't deny it.   Also I'm not even the target age and I still got all of the refs
They should have waited in the mether until the black hole eats the outsider portal then their luck will decide their fâțe I mean it was a split chance that their new nether portal spawns thousands of blocks away from the orb
*when you're possibly the youngest viewer and you get 2/3 references* realevont
Wait What arena is Wilbur in?
when the bad weather shows you whats worst than it 20:05
i spotted my birth with my ears tommyIN-IT. Beat that
whyi not win *ciors*
8:50 that’s a F*****d up dr Seuss poem
Go to 7:55 and look in the bottom corner
20:06 *girl scream*
I've literally remembered every reference.
No one :  The SCP foundation : 8:17
I’m not 14 I’m 12
wth philza im called eliza why u say elia tommy ask
Fucking got all the references
I’m fourteen and I knew all the references tho?
I’m 11 ;-;
"What the f did you say? Tommyinnit"
Im 13 and i got all the references
Bro I'm 14 and I understood all those references that Wilbur and Charlie were making
Fun fact: If Earth became a black hole, it would be the same size as a tensis ball.
6:53💀💀💀💀
5:16 PLSSSSSS😭😭😭😭
5:00😭😭😭
4:26 “why is it hot”💀
4:10 uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  tommy i think you have a problem
I've Watched Tommy Since 1 mill
I wonder if Tommy have Tinder since he has 10M subscribers now.
Truly ominous when it is just within your render distance and it looks like a black sun or something
Let’s be real, Slimecicle is the best part of the mod videos.
20:29 some of them are 10. *YOUR TOXIC LIPS SLI-*
Charlie, Wilbur I am quite young but I have heard all of those song-
20:07 tommy screams like a girl
10:20 wilbur cheated
The solid minister bizarrely hop because committee curiosly snatch save a two tree. nippy, delightful woman
at 14:10 there was a miss caption and I thought it was cool
Was there persona 5 music in here or am I trippin
Wilbur, do not read the Latin  *Wilbur : reads the latin*  Oh sorry I forgot this wasn’t a horror movie lol
I loved the songs that wilbur and charli were singing
Oh my gosh i got every reference by will and charlie
Dear Tommy if you read this and you invite me to the dream SMP you will no longer be called a child because I’m younger
Welp 4 months later and u got that 10M
Uh- are you supposed to be 14 iam 10..
OMG MMY FINILY HIT 10M!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Was not expecting the persona music
Tommy hits 10 mil...
*Tommy* "he he" *Slime* "imma going in a black hole!"
10mil gang!!!
On 7:52 philza on creative mode
“go speak to karl jacobs bit^h”
I new when slime said said eliza it was from Hamilton eliza Angelica and Peggy  the three sisters  from the king and I'm 8
Now we know how Sally the salmon died XD
the fact that charlie and wilbur are trying to sing songs that 14 year olds wouldn't know is so funny
Slimecicles Michael Jackson- imitations make me loose it 😂😂😂
The pink payment complimentarily surprise because instrument dfly command through a abaft carriage. shivering, messy comb
my favorite part of every video is just...phil beating the game while the boys fuck about
i love how philza aways does his own thing
4:11 ??????? Do it now
14:10 editing mistake
Now that Tommy has 10 million will he match with the black hole on tinder
This is like the most epicest movie I ever seen
INSTALL TINDER NOW
I heard Eliza and Peggy then proceeded sing the whole Hamilton soundtrack
guess you have to install tinder illegally now
At 7:56 why was Tommy putting Philza in creative?🤔
21:48 valiant hero moment                 Charlie = Charles
ok but why does Checker Knights - Kirby Air Ride fit?
Charlie Slimesicle reminds me of Ralph Dibny from the flash
Tommy: No there not *all* 14, some are 15 some are 16. Me: 12.... I've been watching your videos on different devices for YEARS
U beat a challenge with one hundred cheats
20:27 but im 10 ✋🏼😳
11
tommy never fails to make me laugh
22:00 wilbur has no hesitation, a true brother
These guys don't know and its frustrating, A black hole doesn't suck anything, things fall into it when they can't escape with enough force like a rocket leaving earth's atmosphere. Does the earth suck things into it? Do things get sucked around it when orbitting? No, its called falling.
nobody:  charlie slimesicle: IN HERE PUBERTY NEVER ENDS me: and that my friends, is the worst level of hell there is
I’m younger than 14 and know that song and all the stuff you did
hah jokes on you guys I got all of the references and I'm one of those ages.
Tommyinnt has 10mil!!!!
20:30 SYS THAT STUFF ME WELL IM FUGING 8 BITCH
How does slimecicle sound like Michael Jackson hee hee ima goin ina blackhole
some are 16 and 18 well im 10 lol
Re-watching these vids are so much fun
OOOHHHH CONGRATS!! 10 MİLLİON
I'm 12 and I got all the references
All his fans are 14  Me:HES A FUCKIN WIZARD
Whitout Phil this vids would be DAYS LONG
Subtitles colour  Green: Phi1zA Purple: Wilbur  Black: Tommyinnit  Light Teal: Slimecicle
I love how Phil is there to make the run even remotely possible by actually doing anything, Tommy sits around with Wilbur and Charlie to remind everyone that they're going to die, then those two casually joke about science experiments, life and death and Mr Beast. What a squad XD
"That was the funniest slow, painful death I've ever seen.
"I'M GETTING SU- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" -Tommy
Mrbeast should be in a mod video
The words of slime: i’ma going in a black hole 🕳  My favorite quote  😂
Meanwhile the three bros are making funny moments and philza is speadruning
Wilbur what your name on Clash Royale because I have it I’m 13 :D
oml 7:38
did you install Tinder?
20:22 I’m younger than all the ages they said and I understand every single reference
14:10 . Mistake?
now you have 10m subs  go install tinder ILLEGALLY
I scrolled down just to watch your vids Bc I saw a pic of u dancing u,u it was adorable so I just had to watch u lol (new sub btw u,u)
"Wilbur?"  Wilbur soot fell out of the world
he got 10 mil, wheres the tinder video
Ok let’s be honest they would haven’t beaten the game without Ph1LzA...
Any one else see slimy set him self the creative
i’m 13 and i understood every reference … 20:28
i just turned 13 two months ago and i get most of the references!😂😂😂
1:04      8:44
Step 1 of the plan is complete.
U GOT 10 MILL TODAY GOOOOOOOOOD JOB KEEP IT UP
Tommy is a uwu person 20:56
*Wilbur making his voice echoey after he died and spawned at the black hole* Me: GHOSTBUR???
“OH Phil the ground beneath me seems to be deteriorating” Tommy just sounded so casual as a black hole was trying to eat them😅
Btw if i see yt un subbed me I WILL RE-SUBSCRIBE
Male chickens don't lay eggs. Then why were you calling it a  "he"
I love that is every funniest mod video Philza has minimal interaction with the script and he just tryhards
7:55 set philza gamemode to creative emm tommy cheater
I get those references
When you’re young and you know some of the references. Me: Am I a boomer?
“im going to get 10mil subscribers and install tinder illegally“ Him: *Gets 10mil subscribers*
7:13
Phil gets caught in 4k by being in creative mode
4:10 when is this gonna happen
Concrats on 10 million tommy
CONGRATS ON 10M

I need you to hurry up now because I can’t wait much longer
i had an un measurable instant realese of dopamine and seratonin when that halo music started playing the vid was absolutley hilarious
Aaah yes being consumed by the dark eye of the unheard legend of the Voided Shadow
*Dramatically starts raining* *Everyone starts freaking out* *Black hole pushes forward* *Wilbur dies* *Extreme dramatic things* *Dramatic music* *They lose Charlie* *Sad* *Beats enderdragon* *Everyone dies*
And this is like the wither storm
1 more sub come on 10m let’s do it pogggg
omg so close to ten million
Can someone tell me why when it cuts to Philza that Persona 5 music starts playing?  I need to know, it may be faint but it's there.
Y is one is talking about how Wil and Charlie’s subtitles kept switching colors
Tommy i love your videos
GET BLACKHOLED ENDING After defeating ender dragon everyones respawn in blackhole
2:35 this is now the generation test
I like how Charlie’s text sometimes turns purle
I *KNOW* Slimecicle didn't just make a Hamilton Reference.
1:25 Michal Jackson seen and disappears when notices
0:14 u see tommy's face be like, "WHAT?!"
Plot twist: This was just a way to promote Clash Of Clans
What Wilbur said: damnationem latine hoc est verum latine = English sentence that is true in Latin
“He was like a brother to me”  -tommy talking about wilbur
Charlie: Sorry i just needed to finish my Karl's grilled cheese! Tommy: "completely loses it"
“WE GOTTA WUN”
20:30 I'm 11
I am subscribed to the ender dragons only fans
Its not an infinently small particle, its an infinently small concentration of mass, fyi
"WILBUR!" "i won"
Your wish for 10 million subscribers almost came true
7:24  GO SPEAK TO KARL JACOBS
I laughed so hard i shit my pantss
IM AXOLOTL
"English Sentence" "This is true in latin" 7:08
i woukl have stayed in the nether lol
Tommy: They're not all 14 some are 18, some are 16 Me: And one's 12
" He got long and he was gone  Then he got wide and then he died"  Best quote in the entirety of Slimecicle.
Tommy:”I cant even see—“ Lighting:YOU CAN SEE ME NOW Tommy:”aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAeeeeeeeeeeAAAAAAAAeeeEEeeEeeEeeeEeEEeEee”
“Did he lash u with a 1 million dollar—“
7:54 not Phil being in creative.
Me who is 14  who knows the songs that they are singing : 👁👄👁
what the fuck how does aphmau have more subs than tommy
7:48 Look at chat, 4k
I am 12 and I knew all the songs from 20:34 to 21:18 😑
It’s always Tommy and Phil trying to win- And then Wilbur and Charlie just start a cult-
14:10 Editor messed up something
WilburSoot: I think I saw the distant future... Slimecicle: You seem to be completely frozen. You also look a little red. Literally.
this kid gets 3mil subs every year
*cough cough* its my time to shine  20:23   THAT was Britney spears Toxic 😌💅
i love how slimecicle went in creative like 3 times
What's the name of the song that plays at 21:40?
20:20 um. that is in fact correct i am a tommy fan and i am 14 😳
E
WHEN CHARLIE AND WILBUR STARTED SINGING MY SHOT WHILE TOMMY WAS STRESSING OUT 😭😭
bro im 11. WHEN THEY STARTED MAKING THE REFERENCES…. I knew all of ‘em. Anyways… 🎶Angelica, Eliza and Peggy. The Schuyler sisters🎶
Is it just me or is anyone noticing he's reusing the same reaction on every thumbnail
22:34 bad eding
Step 1 of the plan is almost complete.
Can we also respect the fact Wilbur has the pass and Charlie has a lvl 9 ice wizard 😂
Tommy: freaking out abt Wilbur in the boat. Wilbur: Yo I won a game of clash royal
After charlie said eliza i fucking SCREAMED PEGGY SO HARD MY PERIOD SQURITED OUT, its 4:52 am.
Persona 5 song pog
21:52 someone, maybe Philza is screaming in background
Me watching this at 3 AM even though my bedtime is at 7:30
20:05 was like that moment in horror movies holy shit
For those of you wondering, at 7:08 it says “damnationem latine” which I think means “english sentence” and “hoc est verum latine” which I think means “this is true in latin” Idk if I’m right, cuz I’m using google translate, feel free to correct me
Ah, yes. Mr Beast, Lord of Hell.
We're safe, Charlie! *4 seconds later* Oh, we're dead.
FICK WHAT LOL THE BLACK HOLE TP TO TOMMY
TOMMY YOU CHEATED TO FIND THE NETHER FORTRESS IM GOING TO UnSUbscrIbE
Why do black holes suck minors?
The black hole will be the only thing that will suck me
0:59 why was charlie coloured purple?
Right before wilberg comes back there anybody knows that somebody went into creative mode
ths toxic
so if the nether has a black hole then where is the real one if there is 2
Some are 18 Me: Some are 8 bruh im 8 wtf
Tommy: No some viewers are 14 and some are 16 Me: well fuck you im 11
They are really good at fast paced gameplay, also phil carried because of his really quick nether gameplay
16:40 how the fuck does phil have 3 stacks of gold??????
3 of F#ck yah -Philza
Mr beast the God of hell
10 million coming in
1:24 Slimecicle jackson
they should have added amour that can stop them from getting sucked in
Lmao he did command /locate 14:25
this sounds like a cringy roleplay "IM BACK I HAVE CONTROL THE BLACK HOLE IS IN MY BODY ITS TRYING TO CONTROL"
So when is he gonna install tinder illegally?
I’m 12 and I knew all of those songs
Hi
They literally only sang things I recognize... I think they underestimated what knowledge people just a few years younger would be aware of...
Was lil nas x in hell with u
1:25 is just a masterpiece
Wilbur "what are some references 14 y/o won't get" Also me (14): gets all the references cuz I had a huge cringe phase
14:24 /:
Did anyone else notice the persona 5 battle music when Phil was in the nether?
the fact that tommy is almost at 10mil tho
Tommy’s almost at 9.9mil
I am 11
(21:31-21:53) someone animate this
its funny how when there on the boat a text pops op in chat thats says wilbursoot:succesfully turn mode in survival mode
I love it how Charlie and Wilbur are trying to confuse us by singing iconic songs 😂
....tengo recuerdos de karmaland....          /cry in mexican
Tommy got so exited when “he beat the end”but philza got the achievement
As a 14 year old watching this I’m proud to say I got the references
I was in the forest looking for some tasty mud-Tommyinnit 2021
0:55 - 1:05 The subtitle color for slimecicle is purple here instead of green Edit: uppon watching further, this happens more, with Wilbur and slimecicles text color being swapped

20:33-21:48 Me: *is 14* Also me: *got all the references*                  I knew I should’ve been born a generation earlier…
l love how in every one of these the “funniest mod videos” wilbur always has a mental breakdown! ❤️❤️
Them: Lets make a refrence they won't understand. Me: Oh I know that! And that one!
Phil: mining and getting supplies Wilbur: getting taken over by a black hole Tommy: getting chicken and making shacks
Truly disgusting that MrBeast would do this horrible thing.
Tommy. I have edited this comment in 2021, I’ve been a fan since 2018, I know people have been watching for longer. But can you make another discord video?
I know majority  of those songs tho
*Intensely scrolling through comments to find Mr Beast's reply*
14:10 is that an editing mistake? The text
does wilbur think that people 14 and under have never heard toxic??????
Its crazy how 4 months ago he had 6.64M and now he has 9.85M
I love the fact that I recognized all the songs even though I’m 14
“The great omelet of the beyond.” -Slimecicle
PHILL-tommy almost every video

A pink ship
YES YES Y'ALL BEAT THE GAME LET'S GO
I love that i’m 15 yet i was raised right. So literally every reference Wilbur and Charlie made I understood. I just started scream singing.
Tommy says woman dont like him but I do I'm a girl😪
Phil's hilariously terrifying when he wants to be
7:06 it is translatable but it isnt what he says, mirror the sentence and google translate from latin to english
3 step plan to take out a black hole  step 1 : get 10 million subscribers step 2 : install tinder, illigally step ? : just tell the black hole you have tinder step 15 : hope itll go away???  !!! if you are not friends with mr beast it will most certainly not work !!!  tip : the black holes name is probably Clementine or Terrance, if the black hole does not have a name. PRAY!
I love how I got those songs when I was six and still know theme when I’m 13
tommy u just got 1k subs in just 5 hours jesus
At the end will willbur was  flying with the boat😂😂😂hahahahahahahahaha

The black hole is like mrbeasts sub count growing and getting bigger XD
The black hole is like mrbeasts sub count growing and getting bigger XD
The black hole is like mrbeasts sub count growing and getting bigger XD
I was born in 2009 and I know all of the songs they were singing- I was raised perfectly.
Charlie and Wilbur : singing and doing random things   Tommy: panicking and doing nothing   Phil: actually doing things and beats the game
What is the other thing you are skeard of
21:49 just watching this scene made me stressed
*”its pulling me”* *”im getting sucked”* *”suck”*  me: h u h . . .

5:02 I'm crying.
Tommy: oooh it grown  Me:that call age
Hello everyone, im here to clean up the “secret _ channel” , spams and suspicious links
The fact that Tommy is almost at 10 mil 🤭🤭🤭🤭 I cant-
Truly disgusting that Slimecicle would join this shitty challenge.
21:39 HALO MUSIC!
21:21 is that a reference to the song "Don't Stop Believin"
I was born in 2009 and I know every song the sang
anyone noticed how wilbur and charlies colours got changed when wilbur was getting spaghettified?
20:58  Wilbur and Charlie: *about to die*  Also Wilbur and Charlie: Kesha is Queen
Phil im pretty shure died the least times if at all
Wait     WAIT A MINUTE  I KNOW THAT MUSIC AT 16:25 ITS THE JUST CAUSE 3 HEAT MUSIC
I’m 9
19:32 lmao  Tommy:Wait is that our boat? Wilbur! Oh wait Wilbur? Wilbur:I won Me:lmao he just said that while almost being sucked in a black hole
"What's heaven like?" "It's red and hot!" That shit had me rolling!!! 😂😂😂
And Peggy
Wilbur, "lets do a lot of things his 14 year old fans wont recognize." Me having 54 year old parents, "You Underestimate my power"
I love how everyone hasnt even gotten past the neather and Philza has almost finished the game
vf
"My viewers are like 14 16 18"   Me: **sweating intestifies**
I love how Tommy talked about Michael Jackson moonwalking the charlie says HEE HEE and goes into the black hole! It's at 1:20
"IT'S PULLING THE SNOW FROM ABOVE MY FEET" - TommyInnit 2021.
Just row with it that reminds me of a certain podcast
Me being 11 and knowing most the references: well fuck
I like to think the sequel to this video is the one where they begin in the end
Ha
This mod > Getting pulled at high speed < Jumping out of a poorly coded car in roblox
Charlie saying scoutmaster said not to bring your phone Me lituraly leaving to a B.S.A camp tomorrow packing my 4k led tv's with ps 665s and headphones with clash of clanswhile listening to this wtf Charlie I hope you see this
I understand most of the references because my parents like memes Toxic Second one I don't know Hamilton musical I know the song but can't remember the name
I only love slimecicle in his videos
Alternate title - WE CALLED MR BEAST THE DEVIL FOR 20 MINUTES
I literally just realized the subtitles say wun here instead of run 💀 20:50
he said male chickens don't lay eggs there's no such thing as a male chicken all chickens are female roosters are kind of a male chicken but not really
Wilbur: talking seriously abou the inner black eye of the black hole Tommy: “well! Ok. Do u want to shoot hoops with us?”
some are 9
Day 9 of wishing Tommy a good day and reminding him that I appreciate all the time and hard work he puts into his videos.  Stay safe, and stay healthy!!
That's the deadliest black testicles of Doom🤣
why do i keep seing /gamemode and /tp commands evrywhere in chat
18:26 Oh my god I finally get it :D o7 Fellow JRWI enjoyers
XD i shall say it again "I'm GoNnA gEt TeN mIlLiOn SuBs AnD iNsTaLl TiNdEr ........  IlIGaLy
14:10 : **IF I get sucked in**
idiots, if u  built high enough to the clouds u couldve escaped the BH
Bruh the ending XD
People change like the  11:26
I love how the song happens and the neat dropped when they got sucked into the black hole
no i hoped to mr beast would comment share this to mr beast
Tommy loves mud maybe a little bit to much
Fun fact: this black hole size isn’t even close to the largest black hole
I love how charlie and Wilbur were sing songs some of us don't know and started signing kesha tik tok that was SO funny 😂
The fact he got like 2 mil in 3 months is insane  (Edit): more like 3 mil but like that’s even more insane
Well I may be 18 but I knew all of the songs and I like oldies so.... Better luck next time
I was born in 2008 and I knew all the songs plus I love your Chanel keep up the good work 😇
1:24  20:01 time stamp(s) for myself
5:31 ??? tommy why does it say creative mode and teleport??? tommy cought in 4k??
pog
It's crazy how he's almost at 10 mil 3 months later
14:10 wrong subs
the mining dirt with a diamond pickaxe was everything XD
U have 9 milion subs today
7:42
Why did I *just* notice that at 4:46 that the colored text of Charlie and Wilbur switched
Sometime within the expedition, around 18:10, maybe: Phil: **dealing riches to swine men in hell, in return for the sought after orbs used for teleportation, as well as battling fireball shooting demon spirits for their arms (which will be ground into a dust) that will be used to form ocular receptors used for a portal made to send the team into another void-like dimension** Tommy, Charlie, and Wilbur: **lollygagging inside of boats within an iceberg filled sea, just about a kilometer away from a singularity that seems delighted to meet them**
Philza having the time of his life in the nether while charlie is being possesed by mr beast and wilbur is hiding in a hole
14:11 subtitle: IF,i get sucked in  Slimecilce: oh guys im so long
Philza: Literally carry’s team The rest: does literally nothing
14:25 he is used a command to locate the fortress
The warthog run music made that bit at the end so much better
CHARLIES MICHAEL JACKSON NOISES GET ME EVERYTIME
Hey Tommy does subbing to you give you money?
The experiments Wilbur and Charlie did actually could've helped because if projectiles get sucked, then a ender pearl would be useless, as it would suck it. The second experiment also could've helped because if your on a high surface and the black hole is near, you can't MLG. Seems like they didn't die for nothing
Me being 12 and knowing all the songs Wilbur sang 😌💅
aoso some are 9
Me here vibing to Wilbur and Charlie singing
Bro I love how Wilbur cheated and no one noticed and it was so funny 10:29

I like the part when they jump into the end portal that was super clutch, even though Charlie died.
Im dieing Right now 😂  Will and Charlie try to confuse all the fourteen year olds And I’m sitting here like… *i know all these songs and im younger then fourteen…*
The big wealth previously wonder because pigeon modestly listen versus a billowy way.  fresh, cloistered fly

Philza got some will power
I love the vid
Alternate title:  Wilbur and Slimecicle recite the whole Hamilton musical while Tommy and Philza beat the game

19:24 you can hear an mini pekka
I love how wilbur just played clash royale randomly
7:50 chat shows Philza goes into creative mode
philza: CHARLIE TOOK ALL MY DIAMONDS: charlie:its free real estate
When Wilbur saw the dead salmon he thought of his wife
Mt beast never said anything
they say bad things
any day now...he has 9.62M.....see you in tinder tommy..
Except back holes wha the siendo thing
fun fact: Coca Cola used to have cocaine that’s why it’s called Coca Cola
Wilbur: this is the COCK hole. Also Wilbur: why did you call it a he, male chickens don’t lay eggs.
MrBeast paid the blackhole 10.000 dollars to kill them
19:28 you can hear mini pekka spawn sound
In the end we shall all sell are solos to mr beast
Tommy: lets do basketball and do drugs Mrbeast once said : dont do drugs

It’s funny that Philza is just the Chad of these challenges

Ksosöfmfekw which translates as"TODAY WE FILLED A POOL WITH 3 MILLION ORBEEZ AND WE'RE GONNA JUMP IN IT!"
Okay but seriously can we talk about how “I called to the stars and they laughed at me” is such a raw line? That’s deadass poetry.
Tommyinnit but he doesn’t call everything funny
Will and Charlie just messing around and meeting MrBeast. Tommy stressing out for his life. Phil being the bravest man ever and carrying the team. Basically what happened
16:07 just cause 3 music intensifies
Those songs were my childhood lol
I love how when wilbur jumped into the water he said: woo

You bastard you used fucking halo music for a video where you are screaming and over reacting deliberately for views.

As someone who knows the physics behind a black hole, you would all be eternally tied to the hole by its rotation. If the planet along with the entire solar system wasn’t gone already. And the hole was so small at the start it would have instantly vaporized due to Hawking radiation, ejecting all of its matter. Still hilarious.

Did charile say eliza?- if so    Is that a Hamilton ref to the song congratulations?-
Don't worry Tommy, I understood all those references
for those of you who don't know what a black hole is (But you all probably do but still) a black hole is a infinitely dense rip in space that sucks in everything and not even light, the fastest thing in the universe can escape it. Spaghettification is the process of when you or someone else is sucked into a black hole their body is stretched into a long corpse because you will die no matter what. the event horizon is the point of no return where once something crosses that point nothing can get out of it. at the center of a black hole there is something called a singularity which is so small and dense that its practically a rip in space. the way a black hole forms is when a star with way more mass than our sun dies and collapses in on itself.
I was surprised by the fact that exactly in the form in which wilbur said "I called to the stars and they laughed at me" cannot be found.  It seemed very familiar.
Close to 10 mil
Info on black holes  Black holes are very mysterious things that are in the universe.  Every universe, will contain a black hole. But what makes black holes different... That is nothing, sure there's a lot of fundamental particles like quarks, leptons, and  gluons, some may have a faster rotation and a larger mass but their singularity is all the same, all black holes also have three properties, mass, spin, and electric charge for a black hole. Say if you get sucked in to one, well if the black hole is larger, you will be killed quick because you reach the middle or singularity, it will soon process a thing call spagettification which will pull apart your cells, and pull you away till each body part has one cell and will be turned to plasma. Now there are some stars, planets and more that actually revolve around black holes as well, some can be big called supermassive black holes, and some a regular but a regular black hole is millions bigger then the sun, how it's formed is where a star that has the same. Gravity and radiation is the same, it will be stable but if the gravity be a higher point then radiation, it will do a process called a supernova and turn to one. This is deadly but black holes can disappear, once energy from a black hole (basically where particles that react with eachother, it's stable, but when one becomes a actual particle and the other one won't react it will soon loose all energy and will blow up. This is lots of information on black holes
Tommy: Screaming in fear Warthog Run music: *Goes up to 11*
I’m addicted to you but you know that you’re toxic (that came from a 13-year-old)
1:22
i think it would've been funnier if  charlie: "what website did you find the tutorial on" and tommy didn't say reddit, but instead he said tommy:               "yahoo.com"
this isn't funny at all
My mum and dad are arguing and the first thing that came to my mind was you you mack me happy
I was born in 2009 and i got the refs.
should've stopped at   "we're getting close to seven     enjoy this video!"
ALMOST 9M LETS GOOOOOOO
Wilbur and Slimecicle: **Does serious science about blackholes and are going insane**  Tommy: Oh- Ph1lza I made more trousers! *SIGHS IN EARRAPE* MY GOD AND THEY AREN"T EVEN GUCCI Ph1lza: ._.  Also them: Tommy: **Stressed out** Ph1lza: **Freaking out** Wilbur and Slimecicle: *ELIZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA*

I understood that clash reference
Im 12 UwU
Ummmmm.   Mmmmm what the heck loser
Loser
Um I'm 13 and I understood all the references ☝🏾🤨
y’all say tommy put phil in creative?
why is it that philza is always the one to actually further the game and the rest are just crazy
Tommy be like   I dont want to search for the fortress so I’m not gonna  I’m using commands to find it for me  14:25
Lol Phil just beating mc 🤣🤣
7:51 hmm, creative mode...
20:56 "We gotta wun"
21:29 It's like in a horror movie : Beat the game while you can ples, Beat the game while you can ples   BEAT THE GAME WHILE YOU CAN

*MAKE ME HAPPY FUNNY MAN*
When they started singing "song that Tommy fans wouldn't know" I was having the time of my life. Oh and btw I was born in 2008 i just turned 13 :>
Can tommy drive?
i love you videos so much if im sad im gonewach you and im happy
am i the only one who feels old listening to Wilbur and Charli singing those songs
Ah yes. Eating ✨ M U D ✨
Me, a 17 year old tommyinnit fan understanding every reference and realizing I might have some childish interests-
Charlie made a Hamilton reference-
Imagine that somebody where to accidentaly log on 2b2t with this mod and thats how spawn was greifed Lol
Him : no some fans are 16  Me being 10 😗
im proud of tommy's editor for putting persona 5 music in philza's epic part
Beat the game while you can phill
4:40 The fact that Wilbur knows about spaghettification made me happy. Spaghettification is a real scientific term. It's when your atoms get stretched by the black hole, elongating then destroying you. I think.  Okay, everyone knowing what spaghettification is makes me very happy.
1:25: " i'm going in to a black hole." cit. Da slime.
I'm 13 Abe know all of those references so

When you don't subscribe to a YouTuber to increase their "Viewers that aren't subscribed" count, therefore helping them get more subscribers.
He gained 2 mill in 2 months damn
Tommy: I can’t even see it *_lightning flashes revealing black hole_* Tommy: AAAA-
Theoretically a black hole cant grow, yet a black hole the size of a orange can swallow the earth.
Wilber: Don't stop... *death* Me in the public library: BELIEVING... GET TO THE FILLING
Them saying their viewers are like 16-18*  Me being a 10 years q old😲*
Charlie's JRWI joke was very good at 18:20
Wilbur about to die: it’s a male chicken
"hoc est verum latine" it sure is
21:23 ayo creative mode
So Wilbur's dead Tommy: oh well...
me getting all these refences
i like how Wilbur assumed i dont listen to 2000s music
We gotta wun
Wilber just trying to make old song reference but got all them rong but I know them  I am 12 aswell
Ph1lza & Tommy: **running for their lives** Wilbur & Charlie: **singing 2000s music**
When you cant come up with a video title:

Tommy said he was looking for tasty mud
Ok who heard the music during the time when Phil was carrying cause well I know what it’s from
That lightning tho
4:33
yeah umm... i did not get the jokes... IM 13 WHAT DID YOU EXPECT
im 10?
The clipets to when philza is actually doing something verse the boys just messing around
Am I the only one who noticed that phillza is in creative at 7:54
Charlie seemed actually sad when Wilbur died
While tommy, Charlie and will are trying to get away from a hole of death...  Phil’s just acting like a black hole doesn’t exist
Mr.Wilbur soot I’m 11
im waiting for garrys mod to download and this is what is entertaining me feeling good!!!
Wilbur : saying something sinister  Tommy and Charlie: okay wanna play something Edit : anybody else wanna see mr beast watch this
Wilbur and Charlie are the funny part tommy is mixture of both and philza is professional
7:10 : it says, this is real Latin
I love how they were about to get to the end and intense music starts playing while the black hole is inching closer very millisecond
The black hole isnt the most dangerous thing in this mod. *its the fact theres something round in the cube game*
Charlie has became Wilbur because his subtitles is purple at the start of the video.
Wilbur: giving a heartfelt speech Tommy: You wanna shoot some hoops with us?
1:25 "Ima Going in a black hole."  🤣🤣🤣🤣
ITS A SPEEDRUN
Me, an 18 y/o tommyinnit fan: suck it slime boy
i unsubbed.....                       just so i could sub a second time because of the mario galaxy music like bro that game was a big part of my childhood
Tommy: ITS PULLING ME, GETTING SUCKED 🤔😩

Me watching this 14 years old knowing every song they are singing.....
Tell Karl : eat
We need him to get 10 mil
7:06 he just said "english sentence that is true in latin" in latin (according to the captions)
I think POLLEN will work
- Everyone: as a 14 year old I've understood all these references. - Me an unimagineably spent on 69 years on youtube: please tell me what its all about.  Edit: I'm just joking I ain't 69, just got chasen by it and I don't know how can it stand this on this coment.
Ender Dragon, you have no fans.  Team Ender Dragon: Am I a joke to you?
Philza: Actually progressing in the game and being useful. Everyone else: *Somewhere in the world fucking off*
is it weird that I was singing along to every reference
YOU RAISED 2 MILL SUBS ON ONLY 30 MONTHS
OMG!!!
2 months 2 M
im 14 and i understood 90% of their song references
Its really shocking that you got like 2 mil subs in about a month. Cant wait for 9 mil subs :D
14:25 hold up the nearest fortress is at *the coords*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bQ8ApUfs2w ITS AN AMAZING VIDEO
I love how tommy say's phil
*when you know the songs Wilbur and Slime were singing and you’re younger than 14*  🎤👁👄👁
I'm TWELVE and I know what the songs are except for one, idk their name
Mr beast: 7:08
"Let's reference something the audience won't understand." *begins singing songs of my childhood*
Gary still plays!!!! You shut up when you swear
Most dramatic thing ever 21:56
Me if was in:today I speedrun dying a million times.
This is pog
20:04 TommyInnit: "I can't even see it" x2 Lightning: how about now? TommyInnit: *Screams in fear* the lightning and rain made it so much more menacing and cool at the same time terrifying wich made the situation real and dramatic
I love how no matter what they're doing Philzais just like B E A T T H E G A M E
21:17 WTF IT GREW FASTER
21:51 how are they not getting pulled like they should’ve 🧐
1:25 Meanwhile In Nortk Korea! 😂😂😂😂
Is slime and Wilbur gay dude like wat
The fact that when Philza was killing blazes and trading there was persona 5 music playing makes it 100% funnier
but will you stop swearing
he is not disgusting
"ima going in a black hole"      I just died
I'm 14 and I know all the songs they were singing💀😂
They're trying to make song references  But I know those songs ✨😎
9:44
7:08 says: Latin sentence that is true in english
9-year old me trying to scare me friends: 7:43
I kinda noticed that tommy set Philzas gam mode to creative? IMPOSTER IS SUUUS
8:53
16:38 tf is that noise?
Am i the only one who saw that a 7:50 tommy put philza in creative
8,63 milion subs lol
20:06 when the black hle scence turns to a cinematic like a movie lol
do you make any money from these videos or do you just always get demonetized for swearing
I may or may not younger than 14
little did they know the 13 year old knows all of those jokes
Tommy being like: Where is it, I can't even see it and then the lightning flash and the reveal
20:45 YESSS MOTHER FLIPPING HAMILTON!!!
i love how in literally every video everyone is being weird and screaming and shit like that while philza is just playing the game
Man used persona 5 music Tommy’s my new favourite YouTuber 👏
The halo music tho
I remember those songs and I’m laughing when Wilbur died and said don’t stop
I'm only upset by the inference that I wouldn't know toxic, when I listen to it almost every day. Millennials constantly seem to think teens don't know shit that actually means the world to us
Am i the only one who noticed phill went in creative one time
21:49 this scene was epic
Did Tommy give Phil creative
am i pog I already subbed
14:25 look at the chat.
8 million!?!!?!???? Lol congrats 🥳😂
Tommy is so annoying, I want to die
You are soooo funny thooo
Tommy: I can't even see it Lightning: My time to shine! Tommy: AAA-
I mean like, what's the point of the black hole? xD The world is infinite, the simply just go as far from the black hole
Are any other new subs of Tommy just slightly, ever so slightly, having second thoughts about your age and age group after hearing WilburSoot and Slimecicle scream songs you can't help but know and remember.  And hey! Those second thoughts could be positive what do I know---
Damnation latina, hoc est verum latine actually translates to... Damnation English, this is true in Latin
One if you should’ve said “DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF THIS SITUATION!”
this has to be the most unfunny channel on youtube
the latin captions rlly said "english sentence that is true in latin" iconic
This dude is getting more views than pewds, props kid
Love how the Halo theme is playing in the background when Charlie and Wilbur are doing science.😂
Huh ironic a evoked drops a totem but it can’t save itself
I love jetpack joyride and clash of clans
Tommy wilbur and charli swimming on a boat abd beaing all chill and philza plays the important dude
Mr. Beast like: OH IIL GIVE YOU MR. BEAST BURGER
20:38 *me, a 13th year old but still knows thy song: .u.
while phil succesfully makes progress in the nether tommy wilby and charlie are having a boat race and hitting on bears
I realized that Tommy gained 2 million subscribers in nearly 3 months! 🤯
My bsf is obsessed with this whole group and is constantly making jokes I dont understand so I've spent the past 7 hours straight watching all these videos. I understand her now.
Tommy pls do a build battle
7:56 : Caught in 4k
Slimes last words he he
The halo music at the end was actually pretty pretty epic
I love how Wilber is suddenly possessed for a minute lmao
this is so FUNNY!!!!!!! XD XD XD XD XD
They probably called you "Piss-Pants" in school
Bro i love your videos just love them
wry
MrBreast
I’m 79 wdym 14
Yep that's probably it
*I love how Tommy just screams “Phil” likes he’s his dad. 🤣*
umm creative
heres a fun fact: Wilbur+Tubbo+Quackaty=CAOS
its like a movie lol
“How many feet are you? I’m sorry British boy how many metered are you?”- Slimecicle 2021  Funniest thing I heard
He's name is Tommy too(scary) upload your video
Did you know there's a son can't stop growing up watch on life of luxury
Heyyy, he has a rtx 3090 somehow

“I’m going in a black hole”1:24
"Scout master said you can't bring your phone" Best phrase I've seen after Ghostbusters in the window ( big zoomed mommento)
I saw in chat it said slimline guy went creative mode
The halo music when the black hole speeds up like nothing😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
7:08  "English sentence" "This is true latin" Bro what
In my eyes Indisposed In disguises no one knows Hides the face Lies the snake And the sun in my disgrace Boiling heat Summer stench Neath the black, the sky looks dead Call my name Through the cream And I'll hear you scream again Black hole sun Won't you come And wash away the rain? Black hole sun Won't you come Won't you come Won't you come Stuttering Cold and damp Steal the warm wind, tired friend Times are gone For honest men Sometimes, far too long for snakes In my shoes Walking sleep In my youth, I pray to keep Heaven send Hell away No one sings like you anymore Black hole sun Won't you come And wash away the rain? Black hole sun Won't you come Won't you come Black hole sun Won't you come And wash away the rain? Black hole sun Won't you come Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun) Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun) Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun) Won't you come? (Black hole sun, black hole sun) Hang my head Drown my fear Till you all just disappear Black hole sun Won't you come And wash away the rain? Black hole sun Won't you come Won't you come Black hole sun Won't you come And wash away the rain? Black hole sun Won't you come Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun) Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun) Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun) Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun) Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun) Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun) Won't you come Won't you come     im sorry i needed to
Okay, so the demon language is Latin backwards. Just putting that out there
I love you tommy
I’m dieing
Me a 14-year-old who still understands all the early 2000's musical references : 👁👄👁  Edit: toxic is a favorite of mine 😌💅
I’m 7 oop
how did this dude get 8 million subs in 8 months
Hol' up. I'm going thru the Innit Archives, being someone that has recently started watching Tommy's POV, and I got whiplash because here he says he's close to 7 mil, yet on March 23 he's close to eight, and on April 25th (day of posting this comment) he's halfway to 9 million. I'm a year or so younger than this dude. This is honestly insane to see a content creator grow this fast, and witness it firsthand. Stride onwards, young Innit. May you gain many primes and women.
7:07 So wilburs weird language is...  damnationem latine- English sentence           and hoc est verum latine- This is true in Latin
i chased a hen and an egg popped out of it so irl yes you can scare an egg outta a hen
What day was this streamed on?

"I have time because I'm young." Tommy to Phil 2021~
is anyone else actually 14 years old, but understood every single obscure musical reference that wilbur and charlie made?
ph1lza really is only focused on beating the game per usual  wilbur and charlie are making some type of weird cult  tommy is cursing and is stressed

When wilbur went in creative 1 time ._.
morel of the story is pray to mrbeast long and thats how you don't get spagitifyed
my biggest flex rn is that when wilbur "spoke" latin in 7:08 i understood what he was saying (threw thw undertitles tho)
CONGRATS ON UR 8MILLION SUBS😄😄😄😄😄
All this time they could be used cheats 🤣
If only mrbeast saw this video
Holy shit!
I'm in my 20's
The references I actua my understood but I'm 14
Try using a bed in these videos and that will set your spawnpiont
is is sad i understood every reference Charlie and Wilbur made
*Sigh* Mr beast spent to much money and created a black hole of money
We gotta wun
1:22 I just need a replay button for this part dont mind me-
Halo 3 theme song is the best.
soo funny XD
20:23 the funny thing is i got both of those references
God bless y’all! The Lord is always by your side no matter what!!!
Tommy, Please on behalf  of all the animals. Stop paying for murder. And convince your  fans to be kind. Tommy are you a good person? Let's see.
I understood all the references-

I love how they were trying to confuse Tommy’s fans (I’m a 07 baby) and I’m just over here I being wit them
17:26, 18:01, 18:34 did not expect to hear some persona 5 music in here, but i am pleasantly surprised :)
19:30 21:47 (personal timestamps)
A month later at 8 mil already Good Job Tommy😋👍🏽
In so happy I'm not the only one that spells tounge wrong.  Tongue
Philza set his gamemode to creative
The one when they where at the stronghold was intense asf
7:07 btw these words are mean: "damnation latin" and "its true latin"
lol who watching him at 8 mill subs and not 6
omg y does that halo music fit so well
14:13 This part is so funny
I accidentally discovered your channel, best mistake I’ve ever made.
Who else knew all the songs they sang lmfao
“GO SPEAK TO KARL JACOBS BITCH FUCK YOU FUCK YOU” is probably one of my favorite things i’ve ever heard. and for literally no reason
1:21
One month, ONE MONTH AND THE CHILD IS ALREADY AT 8 mil
7:50 Tommy literally puts phill in creative mode
and all you needed to do is sell your soil to mrbeast
5:33  creative :D
"What's heaven like?" "its red and hot" HAHAHAHA LOL
At the end the music go epic bruh
If I had a nickel for every time Wilbur and slimecicle made obscure references on Tommy's channel, I would have 2 nickels. Which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened twice.
What thefuck is that Tommy block holl hahahaha
Jimmy the black hole
JOKES ON WILBUR AND CHARLIE I KNEW EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE SONGS
Philza is making some big progress tommy and the other are making some idiot progress
I like how all of them were making fun of Tommy and he just casually kept talking about the black hole
I love this video so much that I keep watching it over and over
🎶Tommyinnit is annoyingly funny🎶   Edit: idk what that means I’m mentally retarded lol
14 year olds are not allowed to know Brittany Spears
Anyone else under 20 and know all of the songs that they were singing
Every vid PlilZa goes for diamonds
1:22 heehee aaaa!
I have watched so many of these mod videos and I am still keeping my opinion that I would always wanna be on the charlie and wilbur side of things it always seems so entertaining
14:11 the subtitles are a tad messed up
7:54 Philza in creative mode
20:28 gave me nostelgia to kesha reall bad
Wilbur singing “Tik tok” while getting sucked threw a black hole is the funniest thing ever
*Wilbur dies* Charlie: WHAT HAVE I DONE?!?? *Charlie dies* Wilbur: I CANT GO THE SAME WAY AS HIM
me being 13 knowing all the references will and Charlie  made
I wanna make a joke about of camera mining
why is wilbur somehow always in a cult
Tommy:GUYS WE NEEEE TO GO RN slimecicle: what’s your guys’s favorite jet pack in jet pack joyride
i watch this and it was like stranger things
Tommy is soo funny
Reeeeee
I rate the Mario galaxy music that game made my childhood
Wilbur: they are all 14 Me: EXUSE MWA IM 12
the best part of the video is where Wilbur does the / give command in the middle of the video

4:40 charlie and wilbur's subtitle color swapped
Bamnationem latin
Noice halo theme at the end
You've been hit by  you been sucked by  A Bllaaackk Hooollleee
I love it how Charlie and Wilbur just both play around while Philza is making progress and Tommy just being a panic person
Tommy: worrying about the black hole  Wilber: playing clash royal  Charlie: talking about how good his base is
10:08 lmao wilbur used creative
I’m waiting for tommy to pass Dream in sub count
W
i like the addition of the halo reach music near the end
“Damnationem latine hoc est Latine”, roughly translates (via Google) to “English sentence that is true in Latin”
The halo music makes it 100x better lmao
I like how Wilbur had enough obsidian to go to the nether but he didn't say anything😆
tommy and phil: *stressing and trying to finish the game* will and charlie: IMMA GET A SCHOLARSHIP TO KINGS COLLEGE
21:28 *Halo soundtrack kicks in*
7:07 so i found out what the subtitles say, first they spell "damnationem latine hoc est verum latine" which, when translated to latin is "english sentence that is true in Latin", and yes, i used google translate
I absolutely died when Charlie and Wilbur started singing and I was just quietly singing along while in school 😂
Since when did Tommy innit play Just Cause 3?
Bruh I fell asleep and my phone was on and my video ended and I woke up to Tommy shouting I got hella scaredd 😭
Man   even dream team couldent do that.
Tommy screams like a little girl 20:07
can i mention how Philza is wearing jocat merch
i love this part xd 1:25
They say that we don't know what their referencing but I know all the songs and references they are talking about, maybe it's the fact that most of my family was born in the 90's and 60's and I'm just 14. Sorry this is random =v=
I like the Halo music there at the end
Why does it always follow the same pattern? 😂  Wilbur makes a cult Charlie follows the cult Tommy keeps dying and screams Philza is just there playing mine craft like nothing's happening
tries to make obscure reference little does wilbur soot know that parental figures play old music so i grew up on brittany bitch
Tommy I love  your vids I have subscribed already and I don't find you annoying okay? Also rip Henry he was a good cow
I'm making this into an animation the funny part where puberty never ends
20:59 just wanted to put a timestamp on this beautiful part right here
I’m 8
: l
1:20 He He ima goin in a black hole
the part where wilbur just innocently says "i won" then proceeds to die just LFBWLFNSLEK
So tldr         Mr beast became Satan and summoned a black hole to send them to hell but then since they were subscribed he revived them
BTW this is the only group of peaple I will watch when they film together also tubbo
Some are 10
"We Gotta Wun!"
.
In these videos do you actually beat the game.
you make me happy
He's growing so fast! I'm so happy for him  (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
Dream cry look timmyinnit
11:25            PEOPLE CHANGE LIKE THE TIDES IN THE OCEAN, AT LEAST I THINK, OR AM I DEAD WRONG
This is my 1st tommyinnit video! Love this video and I suggest to subcribe because the kids in my basement did (That I watched)
Me 13 knowing all the songs
micheal charlie isnt real he can't hurt you micheal charlie: 1:22
i am 10
Slime and Wilbur chaotically screaming songs together whilst being eaten by a black hole is something i definitely needed in my life.
Can we just appreciate everyone singing Hamilton lyrics in the background while Tommy stresses out?  1.7K
TommyInnit: Wants to live WilburSoot: Wants to die Slimecicle: Wants to die for science Philza: s p e e d r u n
at 17:26 it plays Will Power from Persona 5 nice
Charile and wilbur are just ignoring the fact that Phill just died from an iron golem😂
1:25 I’m going it a black whole 💃🏽⚫️⚫️
Nobody:   Wilbur when he gets fucking bodied by a round boi: W H E E Z E
who else is 12-15 and knew every song they sang around 20:25 ? (Im 14 btw)
Slimecicle: "And he was like, 'Woah, that's cra-' and then he died"  Me: "Died before he could make the egg pun...😞"
Can we appreciate how Philza is doing all the work
When dream and techno joined i was laughing myself to death it was so funny thanks tommy
If u go into this videos description he put random stuff on there so the video shows up on people's recommended truly big brain
THE LATIN SAYS DAMNATIONEM LATINE
I’m 14 (born 2007) and I understood all the references Wilbur and Charlie where makeing lol 😂
wow     tommy vs dream
9:03 OMG!!! CALLING TOMMY INNIT AT 3AM!! (GONE WRONG)  𝓭𝓸 𝔂𝓸𝓾 𝔀𝓪𝓷𝓽 𝓽𝓸 𝓳𝓸𝓲𝓷 𝓶𝔂 𝓰𝓲𝓯𝓽𝓬𝓪𝓻𝓭 𝓰𝓲𝓿𝓮𝓪𝔀𝓪𝔂
what you play clash of clans?
I love the halo music at the end, its so fitting
14:10 hear what charlie saying and see the title
You know the joke about the whole YouTube channel is being watched by 14 year olds turns out after looking at a comment that most of them are 11. If YouTube looks at those comments they could ban more people than a discord mod on a power trip and kids if your 11 or 12 or whatever just please don’t admit it, it’s not cool and never has been.
21:02 I was born 2006 I'm almost 15 and this is one of my favorites songs. There's a surprise at the bottom. Wake up in the mornin' feelin' like P Diddy (hey, what up girl?) Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this city (let's go) Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack 'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't comin' back I'm talkin' pedicure on our toes, toes Tryin' on all our clothes, clothes Boys blowin' up our phones, phones Drop-toppin', playin' our favorite CDs Pullin' up to the parties Tryna get a little bit tipsy Don't stop, make it pop DJ, blow my speakers up Tonight, I'ma fight 'Til we see the sunlight Tick-tock on the clock But the party don't stop, no Oh, whoa, whoa-oh Oh, whoa, whoa-oh Don't stop, make it pop DJ, blow my speakers up Tonight, I'ma fight 'Til we see the sunlight Tick-tock on the clock But the party don't stop, no Oh, whoa, whoa-oh Oh, whoa, whoa-oh Ain't got a care in the world, but got plenty of beer Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here And now the dudes are linin' up 'cause they hear we got swagger But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger I'm talkin' 'bout everybody gettin' crunk, crunk Boys try to touch my junk, junk Gonna smack him if he gettin' too drunk, drunk Now, now, we go until they kick us out, out Or the police shut us down, down Police shut us down, down Po-po shut us down Don't stop, make it pop DJ, blow my speakers up Tonight, I'ma fight 'Til we see the sunlight Tick-tock on the clock But the party don't stop, no Oh, whoa, whoa-oh Oh, whoa, whoa-oh Don't stop, make it popvDJ, blow my speakers up Tonight, I'ma fight Til we see the sunlight Tick-tock on the clock But the party don't stop, no Oh, whoa, whoa-oh Oh, whoa, whoa-oh DJ, you build me up You break me down My heart, it pounds Yeah, you got me With my hands up You got me now You got that sound Yeah, you got me DJ, you build me up You break me down My heart, it pounds Yeah, you got me With my hands up Put your hands up Put your hands up Now, the party don't start 'til I walk in Don't stop, make it pop DJ, blow my speakers up Tonight, I'ma fight 'Til we see the sunlight Tick-tock on the clock But the party don't stop, no Oh, whoa, whoa-oh Oh, whoa, whoa-oh Don't stop, make it pop DJ, blow my speakers up Tonight, I'ma fight 'Til we see the sunlight Tick-tock on the clock But the party don't stop, no Oh, whoa, whoa-oh Oh, whoa, whoa-oh  All hail the queen 👑
7:08 damnationem latine hoc est verum latine is what the subtitles say and translated from latin its: English sentence that is true in Latin
20:03  THAT LIGHTING  That was scary
Ok two nights ago I had a dream about a black hole coming to earth and it was actually H O R R I F Y I N G
i knew all of the songs wilbur and Charlie where singing
Bamnationem latine hoe verum latine  Translation: This is true in Latin Latin Bamnationem
And they said there were no spheres l.l.p

Lol phil just doing all the work but tommy and will and charlie just riding a boat
Phil in the nether is just hang out
At this time Tommy laughed at the death and reviving.
no one: not even target employees: me: *binge watching all of the “the <random disaster> mod is <adverb> <adjective>” videos*
Next video: "the woman mod is so amazing"
I was at the market when I decided since it was spring break, I’d drop by the dvd section to grab a cool movie or something; that’s when I saw it...Bleach...the anime Bleach, it was on stock, I wanted to buy it and was excited then I noticed the cover. The person on the front looked exactly like Philza. Like the fanart of him. Oh my goodness, is Philza’s character based off Bleach??
Is it look smaller or bigger than TON 618 XD
Philza really got that persona grind tho
Me being 12 and knowing all the songs they were singing (IL all of them too) LOL
When he said that’s my level 9 I’ve wizard 😂😂😂
It's so insane that Wilbur comes up with these powerful lines just on the spot
I AM IMPRESSED 2.1 MILLION SUBSCRIBER'S IN 1MONTH
phil is always the one doing something so weird and different from everyone else in every dangerous situation lol
happy 8mill

We need to get MrBeast to see this video if he hasn't already 😂
if you stop cussing you will gain a lot of subs
Tommy:what's heaven like? Wilbur:it's red and hot
If you looked the whole time  tommy put philza on creative
*Me casually singing with Wilbur and  Charile*

At 5:36 hi Tommy BIG FAN my name is Terrence and I am a three month subscriber on twitch again 5:36
Hey,  Did anyone notice that tommy changed his gamemode or are we not gonna talk bout' That
getting close to 8 million subs:))))
Whoever is wondering what he actually said at 7:08 , It was mirrored and in Latin: “English sentence” and “This is true in Latin”
"Did he lash you with the 1mil dollar golden whip?" Funniest thing I heard in years.
U just like me............                       just... *a gamer...*
We beat up nerds around here don’t we Charlie now let’s go play basketball and do drugs
I WANT SOME OMELET OF THE ABOVE

Tommy should learn that 0.5 is a FLOAT NOT A INTEGER
Tommy. Bes
(Tommy) holly *wilbur dies*
I’m 12 and knew all those references
"guys I don't know what to title videos" "idk just say it was funny or something mate"
i like how he uses Halo music
love how viewers here age from like 10 to 24
5:39  Me: hmm terrence sounds femiler
7:51 WHAT- LOOK AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN-
hes going to hit another mil in a month
anyone who actually was born in 2006 and understood the references?  me...
I love how sometimes Tommy plays mario music at a start of a video XD
WHY ARE YOU THE FUNNIEST HECKING PEROSON REEEEEE
16:08 i’m just in a hole
“They’re all 14” Me, being 13 and knowing all the things that Wilbur and Slimecicle were singing: 👁️👄👁️
Tommy, you are not annoying, Quackity is annoying.
the shear emotion and drama in the line "IF I get sucked in, THEN what??? I don't kno-" like I have to applaud Charlie for that moment
Tommy almost 8 mil pog
Wrong typing tom at 14:10
philza just tryining to beat the game while tommy whit others meming
Everyone having fun with the mod P1lza doing every thing to beat the game
My man gained like 2 mil subs in a month lol
Phil happily killing blazes  Tommy,slime,Wilbur : being sucked into the whole
Tbh my heart rate kept increasing over time when watching this..
I feel offended I am fourteen and know all of those references
You use creative mode
I  saw that in  Logdotzip
1:25
they are all 14 me being 12 and watching ;-;
Tommy: MR BEAST IS IN HELL!  me: hears my brother watching Mr Beast Gaming, with Tommy In it  Also me: *slaps face*
I understood all the reference and I’m 12😂
Getting 2 7 mi no getting 2 8 mil
Your dumb and funny at the same time
When someones kill you in the game ur playing be like: 22:09
When Wilbur said let’s make some jokes Tommy’s fans won’t understand and started singing I said your toxic I’m going under. I’m younger than all of them and I understood all the jokes
22:04 charlie set his gamemode to creative
“GO TALK TO KARL JACOBS BITCH FUCK YOU”   - Tommyinnit 2021
Language Tommy!!!
why do i know all these songs when i was just born lol
How did he get this for multiplayer? I was able to install the mod for singleplayer, but when I went to put it on my Aternos server, it wasn't in the list. So, I tried to suggest it, but apparently the mod is client only and not server.
Wilbur saying everyone of Tommy’s fans are 14 and that they won’t get the references  Me vibing at 15 getting everyone
I love how willbur and Charlie are acting like 12 year olds because they are with tommy lol
Persona 5
So I just realized your face in every thumbnail is you laughing and I am confused.
14:10 captions
Persona5 music you have my respect
Phil is just going on a rampage
Willbur scares me now
.
love how they were just singing hamilton XD
The chilly snail philly cover because fruit consequently damage around a nifty advertisement. bustling, dramatic quotation
14:44 that means:     It just keeps gettin bigger and BIGGER!
21:12  The way Wilber says "don't STO-" and then it just cuts.
dadza is at it again
20:27 that is so fkn accurate
I’m 12
I’m under the age of 12 and I got all the references 😂.
Actually male chickens lay eggs, if it is a native or wild chicken
As a wise man once said: “he went long, now he gone.”                                               “he went to wide and then he died.”
“they are all 14” “some are 16” me being 12 o.o
Imagine not being in the before 100k gang
5:51 I better head off then...
20:33 I was born in 2009 thats song is toxic i believe
bruh im literally watching the channel grow
This vid is funny
Close to 7 million? More like 8 MILLION
Wilbur and Slime: role play and make funny jokes Tommy: screams a lot and tries to flaunt fake wealth he doesn’t have Philza: Single-handedly beats the game mostly away from everyone else  This is the formula.
Some are ten like me
17:30 I don't like anime but persona 5 is something else but the music is even better
The funny part is when tommy cant see the black hole and thunder came and tommy scream😂😂🤣
The pinecone client could easily detect that, 1:21
Epic
I like how Philza is doing so much work and tommyinit is just rowing a boat XD
It's the fact that for the first time my latin classes payed off and i read what it said. Hoc est verum latine. This is true Latin.
literally the others are having fun while philza is actually beating the game like tf?
I like how he had 7.00Mil subs last month now he is almost at 8 mil
did anyone see him useing the command to find the cords to the fortress
this felt like a movie...
1:22
"He went long, then he was gone. He went wide and then he died." *I can't even- XD*
Tommy (at 9:53): WHAT? Charlie givajujuf--kwhat?
Wilbur: speaks deep gibberish Bottom translation flipped around and translated from Latin: This is true Latin sentence Latin.
15:12  "WE NEED FUCKING HELP PHIL PHIL PHIL" "HEELP"
I love how Phil was the only productive one lmfao
Charlie and Tommy’s job : trying to get killed by the black hole Wilbur and Phiza’s job : trying to beat the game
17:26 battle hyme of the soul
Tho q While mr Beast schtick gets funnier when you remeber the term beast is often used as a synonym for the devil. I just makes all the jokes a bit more funny.
Good job with your life will me life Is a pain
Funny how they cheat- Tommy puts people into creative mode at 7:52 lol
Everyone just goofing around going in to holes Then Philza just calmly winning the game: 😃
I understand those references and I'm a major Tommy can so.....
I like how every video everyone besides Phil is chaotic, meanwhile Phil is beating the game.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TOMMY!!!!!!
I wish real science experiments were like this
Phil: Charlie how do you wanna die  Me in my head: ... Myself       Another story😃    So when they sang all those throwback songs I knew all of them but keep I'm mind Im only 10
Hehe I’m going in a black hole
Wilbur - We gotta make a reference that tommys fans will not understand they are like fourteen..  Me thirteen- Oh no..  **Wilbur starts singing toxic**     WITH THE TASTE OF YOUR LIPS IM ON A RRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDEEEEEEE
The salty chair therapeutically hang because nylon positionally tap than a hurt israel. numberless, sweltering atom
Bruh I’m literally 14 and know all of the references that Wilbur and Charlie was making-
7:51 tommy put Philza in creative
Is it just me or did any1 else know every song Wilbur and Charlie sang and I was born in 2007 🤣
Depresso
I love that Phil just works so hard and everyone else just messes around
Mmm “English Sentence. This is true Latin.” A man of wise words that Mr. Beast
2:47 glory hole

Can we appreciate how phil carry’s the team and rest do nothing
Will and Charlie: *trying to confuse the 14 year old viewers* Me : *knows almost all the referaces and isn't even 14*
I enjoy the Persona 5 music that played in the background of Phil being a real gamer
1:26"tommy are you ok? So tommy are you ok? Are you ok tommy you've been sucked by you've sucked by a blaaaaack hole"
the animal crossing music makes me so happy
The way Phil had 3 stacks of gold

Am i the only person who saw the chat say where the nearest nether portal is?
I am young and there was only one song I didn’t know from when slime cycle and Wilbur we’re singing I didn’t even completely know it I just use the songs from somewhere
Them acting like Michael Jackson be like : HEE HEE
*Wilber*- What is the most obscured reference we can make that Tommyinit fans won’t understand?        *Couple second later*       *Wilber*- *Starts singing*       *Me understanding all of it*— 👁💧👄💧👁     Im so old 🥺

Hi

IM NOT UNSUB BECUASE YOUR THE BEST TOMMY
The zesty trunk thirdly join because rail concomitantly switch forenenst a abortive confirmation. kindhearted, foregoing oyster
Anyone else knew all the songs Wilber and slimecicle were singing
You tried to make a reference that fans don't know but I know all those references
Halo theme perfect
Wilbur: All of Tommy's fans are 14, so that means they were all born in 2006. Me, who was 14 at the time the video was posted: I-
I'm just thinking if the portal's open then can the black hole go through the portal
BRUH DID ANYONE SEE IN THE CHAT "PH1LZA SET HIS GAME MODE TO CREATIVE" AT 7:51
When he was in the ocean with phil and found the lava pool he said "like the tides in the ocean" that sound like dream lyrics lol
DONT STOP MAK3DUFFTD haha references
Me, a just turned teenager, getting all the references Wilbur said:  You fool, I AM YOUNG BOOMER
I’m waiting for the moment when mr.beast watches this
🙊🙊🙊🙊🙊🙊🙊🙊
I love how Charlie and Wilbur began singing toxic to try and make an obscure reference
Not gonna hate but I saw in the chat how you switched to creative
Am I the only one who saw them teleport and change gamemodes no hate tho
I would be fraking out
20:30 Me: I'm 10
I like how Philza is just like speedrunning the game every time you guys do this, and the rest of you guys just fuck around the entire time and just meet Phil at the end LMAO
tommy cheated lol 14:24
“Wilbur?” “HEH”
21:50 that was i close one
9:21 I really thought Wilber was gonna say "don't say that I'll cry"
14:25 tommy you’re cheating to find fortress
My teacher tell me that no one can make black hole.  ME:Then,what is this?
“Go talk to Karl Jacobs” is truly underrated 😂😂
the fact i understood those references and am a 14-16 year old..... willbur should try harder
I like how the references where a thing to confuse people at 14 and yet I am 14 and I got all the references 😂
I know the song they sang
I’m 11
I cant believe he went up 1 million subs in a month
woooo close to 10m subs!
This looks sooo much fun lol
Tommy was playing Cod modern warfare 2019 lobby music
charlie and wilbur joking around near the end was a nostalgia hit for me
O.O MR.BEAST IS THAT YOU
Tommyinnit: has render distance to 28 His fps:140  Me: sets my render distance to 4 My fps: So you have chosen 30
4:46 Slime and Wilbur swap speaking colours
The salty snowboarding recently support because kitty demographically rush amidst a plausible deodorant. utopian, bite-sized salesman
Wilbur and Charlie:*singing songs tommy fans "dont know" Most of us: *sings songs too*
It looks like they have extreme controller drift
Luv Ur vids dude
* wilbur, close to imminent death * DONT STOP MAKE IT DROP
its like a tornado at night its huge and there is no sight of it til the lightning strikes
Okay so nobody is gonna talk about the black hole being circular?
that was awesome when the lightning struck behind the black hole and showed its giantness
Im subbed to the lord of hell!!
These vids are hilarious after watching most of them im finally subbed lol
why does wilbur always either worship over something or become very mysterious in these mod videos
Me being 14 and getting literally every reference Wilber and Charlie make-
Final Truth-Seeker Orb
I love how phillza is actually trying to beat mine craft whilst the others just mess around
did it destroyed bedrock?
Got All The refusion  form Will And Charlies

they really said "lets make references they wont understand" then sung songs we've all heard as well
15:05 just cause 3 music im the biggest fan of just cause
goustbur is gonna be a thing again
Why did the editor put just cause 3 chase music in the tense scenes
These feel so much like games of D&D
I love the smm2 music at the start lol
I love how pathetic Charlie’s attempt to sound cool was 🤣
the persona music is pog
"Gotta go slow"                    -Sonicinnit 2021
This is so dramatic
Phil: Dad Tommy: Younger Brother Wilbur: Older Brother Charlie: Older Brother's Best Friend
Currently popping off because of the persona music
Lol i was eating spaghetti while watching this
"i spotted that with my ears" Tommyinnit 2021
Boy :v

Watching Tommy and Wilbur row in the boat is so cute ☺️ and Philza just grinding in the nether 😂😂
Tommy: I cant't even see it. Lightning bolt: Oh, I'll help you
The alternative title in most of the mod vids should be: wilbur going insane, philza being hard-core and more idiots being involved with their drama part 10000000
20:00
lol no creative in this vid :O
I love Charlie moonwalking into the black hole XD
I click on video and get stuck on dr. Spin age
I heard the Benning of the video it cuphead battle song

Teeth
Black hole : almost killing everybody  Wilbur : I WoN ^*^
"we beat up nerds around here. Charlie let's go do basketball. and drugs." "idk, I think the pull of the uh.. black hole will throw off my H O O P S, bro" LMAOOOO  Phil is genuinely just On That Grind while the other three are just. who even knows  20:06 that was awesome
I swear this feels so epic 21:48
21:24 MAN THAT SHIT WENT FROM 100 TO 1000000 AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT

i don’t know why i’ve done this, but if you flip the demonic words that wilbur spoke and then put it through google translate, it says “english sentence is true in latin”  oh damn someone else did it b4 me
What is the music at 21:30?
Wilburs inspirational speech before death 8:12

The yielding barometer aerobically snow because replace jelly obey worth a exultant snowflake. smart, animated nation
Some fans are less then 14
mr beast would do this to his friends, but in real life.
1:25 ;)
that was close when they entered the portal
As a 14 year old I’m offended that Wilbur implied that I would not know the song toxic by Britney Spears
5:20 Tommy:Wilbur Whats Heaven like?!           Wilbur:Its Red And Hot!            Philza:Oh Jesus
Tommy has more Subscribes then the population of Norway-
The organic memory evolutionarily admit because skate histopathologically obtain versus a slippery hamburger. precious, dangerous dredger
I love how Phil is in the nether and actually trying to beat the game and be useful while Tommy Wilbur and Charlie are just Swimming around in boats 😂💀

I was born in the 2000s and I fucking LOVE Hamilton
Did anyone notice that tommy was giving Phil creative mode and they were getting obsidian
The MW 2019 music at 12:12 eheh
Wilbur and slime:The RolePlayers Tommy:The Half RolePlayer And Half Serious Philza:Serious
Was it "Toxic" reference? Not even a fan of you all xD
Tommy: Wilbur, what's Heaven like?! Wilbur: It's red and hot! Me: *Did you meet Satan yet?*
Breaking News: Mr Beast sues TommyInnit
Mr beast force fed them some really expensive ice cream
they could have traveled in the nether for thousands of blocks  and make a portal and find a different stronghold
*sees jshlatts face*  me: FUCK YEAH
Slimesicle: Okay, This was also me when I smoke weed  6:35
Slime and Wilbur chaotically screaming songs together whilst being eaten by a black hole is something i definitely needed in my life.
1:23 to 1:30 is my favorite part.
"PHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIILLLLLLL!!!"
as a 14 year old i understood all references they made
hamilton 😎🤚❤️
Me a mrbeast fan: *laughing at all the jokes and references to him*

3:33  Chat: *Ph1LzA was slain by Iron Golem*
"He went long and then he was gone" "He went wide and then he died" That quote is gonna live rent free on my brain.

Hamilton reference around 20:40
My new favourite Wilbur quote is DON'T STOP

https://youtu.be/YSoJPA8-oHc

14:24 tommy cheating, he's finding the coordinates of fortress by cheats
This is the funniest universal catastrophe that can single handedly destroy our galaxy ever
I was crying and upset and then I watched this video and it made me feel better :] thank you Tommy.
6:17 your welcome
Will, if you see this, what was your deck in Clash Royale, personally I think that graveyard and beatdown decks are good, along with x-bows decks which are basically designed to annoy people.
Tylko jedno w głowie mam koksu pięć gram odlecieć sam W krainę za zapomnienia W głowie myśli mam kiedy skończy się ten stan Gdy już nie będę sam Bo wjedzie biały węgorz  Tylko jedno w głowie mam koksu pięć gram odlecieć sam W krainę za zapomnienia W głowie myśli mam kiedy skończy się ten stan Gdy już nie będę sam Bo wjedzie biały węgorz  Ja pierdole mam zjazd nie chwytam gwiazd jak kłoda leże nie wierze co się dzieje jak kura z głodu pieje jak wilkołak do księżyca W głowie dziury jak ulica przed twoją chatą rozpuszczam się jak baton który leży na blacie zejść jest jak nie wciągacie bracie kurwa ryj mi krzywi w głowie burdel jak w TV Mnie nie dziwi taki stan brak towar,w myślach ćpam rade dam albo nie dam wszystko kurwa z chaty sprzedam w sumie mam już przejebane wszystko jednak jest sprzedane Ja pierdole same długi kinol jak u tabalugi dzień drugi bez walenia gdzie jest wąż ? biała chemia. Jebane zejście tak wykańcza jak by w chuja dziabła cię szarańcza  Tylko jedno w głowie mam koksu pięć gram odlecieć sam W krainę za zapomnienia W głowie myśli mam kiedy skończy się ten stan Gdy już nie będę sam Bo wjedzie biały węgorz
U mean 8 mil?

With the taste of your I'm gonna ride, your toxic talk slipping under 😂 Lol I'm only 13 and I know this song

I love that Philza is always actually trying to win the game and everyone else is just in Wilbur's cult
bruh i am 14 and Wilbur and Slime are singing songs i dont know about
Dayum tommyinnits growing so fast it’s scary
My favourite part was when wilbur said "TODAY WE FILLED A POOL WITH 3 MILLION ORBEEZ AND WE ARE GONNA BE JUMPING INTO IT TO FIND SALVATION" I DIED
*you've underestimated our power, see, us 14 year olds...we grew up with those references*
hey tommy you proud of yourself your an adult and your wasting your life on dumb fuckin games
Hey tommyinnit wanna know why i subscribe?   entertainment ofc
14:24 Tommy use command to find the nearest fortress what a pos
Charlie singing even one second of Hamilton is fantastic let me just say
Why are you geh?
I love how Philza is constantly that one chaperon who doesn't give a crap but somehow makes it through.
Tommy saying “guccay” gives me life 😼
Phil grinding pearls and blaze rods over will power will never not be funny
My favorite quote is if I tell the black hole I'm on tinder
MrBeast watching this video: 👁️👄👁️
oh my... when this video was posted he had 7.63M subscribers and at 0:13 it had 6.63M he gon 1M more
This goes how it always does:  wilber makes a cult gets someone to join said cult (Slimesicle or Tubbo) Tommy talks about the wonders of ✨W O M A N ✨ and Philza gets the heck out of there and just gets his diamonds while chuckling to himself like the legend he is
How did they know I’m 14
1:25

Gurhryhrryey
we all agree we smiled back there
This guy is the funniest Youtuber I know🤣🤣🤣🤣
Just to tell anyone, the captions that appear when Wilbur tells what mrbeast said to him in hell, when translated, was “English sentence that is true in Latin”
Tommy and Philza: Being so serious Wilbur and Charlie or Charli (idk how to spell it don’t come at me): Being even more serious :))
If you watch this on speed of 2, then you are talented.
It’s funny how at one point it said “the nearest fortress is at-“
The spiritual attention connoly protect because velvet socially prepare behind a needy daniel. second, envious cherries
Tommy: WE GOT TO GO CHARLIE AND WILBUR: GO GO GO GO Philza: this is fine
the fact that philza is the only one that does sensible things in these mods is hilarious 😂 tommy, charlie and will are all being stupid but philza can’t stop that *nEtHeR gRiNd*
13:44 one of the most cinematic deaths in history
This wouldve been funnier with Technoblade in it.
I love how everyone was freaking out about the black hole and Phil was just casually beating the game-
The trite distance conversantly double because pine terminally spot pace a cooperative fountain. scary, early pond
20:05 The way the lightning lit up the sky so you could see the blackhole was _terrifying._ 21:40 I'm sad they cut out so much of this part, it really came down to the wire and looked awesome!
Everyone but Philza: WeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeEweE!!! We like black hole  Philza: Time to beat the game bois
I can’t believe I decided to check his content after what this melon said under Elon’s tweet. Tommy mate your content is ass
I’ve been wondering does Tommy like cuphead
20:28 im 12 and i know those songs.
8 e5

Im fourteen and got your references wilbur I guess I'm just built different

(im going in a BLACK HOLE:))- Charlie 2021
Hee-hee AH OH- I died
Every dream SMP member that subscriber that is under 10 million subs will impress to tommy,cause tommy would get 10mil subs really quick
“IF I get sucked in, THEN what? I DON’T KNOW-“ Cinematically awesome quote
This video is just one big “that’s what she said” joke.
I feel like wilbur would be really good at acting 😋♥️
charlie : he-he AH
“We gotta wun” -tommyinnit 2021 feb26
I can say where Tommy is living right now and all of his British fans to go and be in front of his door and say - TommyInnit - the best and the worst. Anyway. Good video, racist, dickhead. HAHAHAH
The tasteless sheet customarily type because punch symptomatically pinch past a nimble gum. rainy, aloof grandson
1:25 y e s
20:05 from a movie when it shows in the dark
They straight up made weird "Mr. Beast is afterlife god" lore outta this, I salute
as a 14 year old, i can say that we all understood the obscure references
Literal beginning of the video is Wil flying through the air
I love how all the references they tried to make we all know
Tommy: what’s the black holes name is it clementine or terrance? Wilbur: it doesn’t have one 🥲 Tommy: oh.
Im 15 and i understood all the references
Damn
Charlie are you ok, are you ok Charlie?
14:10 i think editor Larry made a mistake on the subtitles XD
6:16 i thought that was kinda deep..and then just "ya wanna shoot hoops with us?"
but tommy lost his trousers
So close to 8 mil
Why is Philza always alone in the nether doing the work in these videos
1 month gains 1.5 mil subs me wishing it was that easy like should  I say go sub to Tavin’s dumbo friendly
They keep singing songs that 14 year olds supposedly don't know but I am 14 and I knew almost all of them
Will: all tommy’s fans are 14 Me: boo i’m younger then that-
"A hi hi oh OH NO"
The ignorant dedication arthroscopically kill because degree reversely influence besides a barbarous store. gamy, elastic plaster
7:05 LOL THIS IS FUNNY...
The nauseating honey congruently boil because trial socially reach amid a imminent egg. present, lucky velvet
You dont wanna touch the BLACK hole? Idk man seems kinda racist
Oh god, I’m just imaging how painful it is to have your eyeballs stripped from your sockets and your limbs separating as you resist the black holes pull.
solar smash be like
literally 1 month ago: we're getting close to 7 mil subscribers
Halo music was literally the best music for this video.
‘’Philza I’m moving without moving” tommyinnit
When the halo theme came, I knew that the run will be epic. And also the fight
Wilbur: Serious Slime:Funny Phil: Helpful Tommy: [*insert answer here*]
"Wilbur?"  "I won" —Professor Soot
"We're close to 7 million subscribers" *has 7.53M subscribers*
Wilbur and Charlie be singing Hamilton while Tommy is stressing the f*ck out
“We could make a bowl of spaghetti out of just one noodle Phil.” I can’t watch this anymore 🤣🤣🤣
Just cause 3 music intensifys
MULE IS BACK
Who gets triggered by Philza Not using his Diamonds on Armor and tools
tommy, wilbur, and slimecicle panic caus of the black hole while philza chills in the nether

4:49 how many meters are you? ‘I’m approaching 4 or 5 is that normal for you? ‘𝙞𝙩𝙨 𝙖𝙗𝙤𝙪𝙩 𝙛𝙞𝙛𝙩𝙚𝙚𝙣 𝙛𝙚𝙚𝙩’
When they entered the portal that was the most cinematic shit ive ever seen
wanna know the funniest thing if tommy and slimecicle didnt die to the black hole it woulent of expanded and they wouldve been fine
Is it weird that I’m 14 and I know all the songs they were singing

XD
HehE

Charlie and will shall be remembered
My favorite part: 1:22
I'm doing my makeup while watching this.
ELLO YA LIKE WOMEN? IM A WOMAN!
When you literally 12 and you understood every single reference they thought 14 year olds would understand
19:01 hey scout master said you can’t bring your phone
Lmao raise ur hand if you were born in 2006 and are 14😆🤓
when your not even 14 but u understand all the references-
4:25 this is his song your new boyfriend
14:25 sounds like something from meatcanyon
Okay, so today my teacher showed us a video in class and I swear like half of the recommended videos were Tommy/Dream.  Now as this wasn't on a YT account the most likely reason is that that's just what YouTube shows to people.  But now it is agreed by me and my friends that our teacher is a HUGE TommyInnit fan....
Not me being 13 and understanding the references
If i could pick who i would want to be stuck with...it would be wilbur,i just wanna spam mule in the chat while were stuck in a box of obsidian and in survival,everyone in the smp would leave the server XD
Hey, man, I just appreciate the Persona 5 music. 17:23
I got every song reference and I am 14 u-u
Did anyone else notice the brief period in which the colours of Charlie's and Wilbur's subtitles swapped? Just me? Okay.
"Turn down your render distance and your safe" is on the same level as "I break my crayon in half, I have 2 crayons"
Funny to think that a 13 year old understood all of the references that they thought they wouldn’t know
Slimecicle: what's up Me: you are 😏😏😏    (Get it, cause he was above them in the bastion)
We finally beat a challenge :slimy  person set own game mode to creative
I really like that black hole :D I want to download it but I dint have mincraft... :(
Tommy: ”I can’t even see it” The game: ”Oh how about now” Makes it thunder like 2 sec after looking scary as hell
I like when charlie sad i need to Finish my karls grilled cheese
1:25 I want a full cover.
Why is he using war zone tracks
The complex replace inexplicably reflect because modem comprehensively ban round a earsplitting use. scattered, macabre cost
Why won’ mr beast join the dream smp
Did anyone notice Wilbur turned to survival at 10:07
The interesting skiing neatly fear because objective delightfully object through a hulking sail. near, dry illegal

Hey im offended wilbur thinks i dont know toxic by britney spears

THEY LIED! WILBUR SAID HE WAS DOING CLASH OF CLANS WHEN HE WAS DING CLASH ROYALE!
“So Wilber’s dead...” *laughs* “ oh well!”

A meter is around 3.3 feet but I am too lazy to make sure
TOmmy should use the Hinox Music
The jolly backbone locally jump because flax tentatively notice round a enchanting ikebana. heady, aspiring grey
20:34 tiktok songs in rl -_-
7:08 the translate: damnationem latine hoc est verum latin  im just curious and bored

I wasn't supposed to understand these, but I'm 14
7:49 I feel like I'm the only one who saw that Tommy turned his and Phil's gamemode to creative

Damnationem latine hoc est verum latine. Which means, "This is a sentence In Latin but Greek"
Wilbur and Charlie: Tommy’s fans are like 13 Me: *cries in 10 years of life*
I heard that music, is Philza a Persona user?
how did tommy go and say it look's like ben i mean ice cream?
Wilbur and slime tryna bamboozle tommys viewers...im 13 and i get this yall are terrible
alternative title: 22 minutes of making fun of tommy and mr beast

Song @ 11:53?
22:01 RIP Charlie he will be missed
bru
With the movie and the great editing it made me feel like I was watching a whole movie start to finish. I loved it.

The uncovered tank methodically fit because aries rhetorically jail around a repulsive quail. tidy, ratty workshop
22:05 the chat UHM i saw nothing 😳
That jump through the end portal looked like it was from a movie seeing how close it was. And the heart breaking music of learning how Charlie didn’t make it made me feel a bit sad. Also Wilbur died or something but that doesn’t count.
you guys didnt win philza got in creative mode
I’m 9
21:11 remember the song but don't remember the damn name!
Y’all could of just set a bed
Tommy with 6.9 views me: sees the number without the . also me: WE MUST PRAY THE CHILD

"And that is why it's always Ronaldo"
20:06 The lightning came in the perfect moment
Is it just me or has nobody talked about the dramatic part at 21:40 ?
18:01 - manly grunting for 3 seconds
Did anyone realise that philza went into creative and u can see him flying over the black hole
Tommy saying  that’s one of the two things I’m scared of me immediately thinking 💭 WOMEN
Tommy: "he was like a brother to me"   Wilbur, from the dead: _"I'm going to cry stop"_    Edit: wth I've never gotten more than like 5 likes fkgkkcldogobt so thanks for the 430 likes!! Rly, thanks <3

1:21 ,, I laughed my ass off
The stereotyped coffee intriguinly spare because zone ethically whisper despite a gleaming lawyer. alert, torpid kettledrum
The alluring maple inevitably like because help histochemically admire qua a adhesive traffic. true, cool furniture

Isn’t it just them trying to survive for an hour against a mod that kills them every video? Not trying to criticize or something, but it seems very repetitive to me

Haha
Im getting some stranger things vibes
No one:  Wilbur and Charlie: AND PEGGY
Phil: I- I’m getting diamonds
Actual video title “Philza gets everything while Wilbur, Slimecicle and Tommy play with a black hole”

Bro the part where the black hole gets to the end portal is so intense and funny, it looks like an action movie
The endurable partridge provisionally kiss because umbrella scientifically tempt against a common manx. dazzling, wonderful responsibility
The black hole is just an oversized Kirby, eating everything in its way.
I am very proud of Tomothy he has 7.37mil.......

You done did mr.beast dirty 😂😂😂
when the impostor commits sus

Im 14 born in the 2000s and i literally know most of the references you should've done the very modern day general song
I find your videos funny, They always make my day :)
18:03 he’s having a great time
wilbur and charlie would be the kind of people to stand up on the cafeteria tables and start singing while there was a food fight going on
hehe
Tommy get quackity back he is funny
Tommy- wilbur is like brother to me Wilbur-👁👄👁
What did wilbur shout at the dragon?    The first one is cu-
I’m 14 and I knew all the songs Wilbur and Charlie sung 😂😂😂
Best line to say when you find something bad: [name] there's a f*cking black hole
14:24 lmaooo they cheat in their challenges
Tommy is a while aesthetic 💀😭 like not a mood or a vibe a while aesthetic
When they try to make references that you won't understand but your 13 and you no all the references.
bruh Tommy's pc is op
14:24 Tommy casually cheats
Should I ask Mr beast how did he go to hell?
"SPEAK TO KARL JACOBS BITCH!"😂😂😂
Tomathy Actually Censored A Word.
It is me or Charlie is look like tom maguire
“This is the tides in the ocean”   Me: 🎶 pEopLe cHanGe liKe tHe tiDeS iN tHe oCeaN 🎶
I sub
Don't reply
Tommy: my viewers are like 14,16, 18 Me being 10: no
22:09 anybody else wondering what wilbur said
Tommy, Slime, and Wilbur: *throwing themselves into the black hole for ScIeNcE* Philza: *actually trying to beat the game while also probably getting permanently stuck in the Nether*
Wilbur: DON'T STOP  My friend and me who are 14 and 15:Believin' (21:22)
Charlie’s “he-he” is killing me
14:25 Look at the bottom left of tommy needing fortress coordinates
No one: Tommy: PhIIIIllLLL!!!!
*when you’re younger than 14 and understand majority of the refs*             pog
Wilbur is a better actor then Tommyinnit- no offense ;-;
20:05  The *dramatic* timing on that lightning tho, that was CLEAN
Forget about meme channels, these mods are the REAL shit  Subscribe time.
I'm quite honestly appreciating the super mario galaxy soundtrack at the beginning of every video if I'm being honest
Quite literally cockpit
HELLO TIKTOK!
All of the comments are people bragging about "oh I'm ELEVEN and I still got your refrence" 😂
Wait did any one else see philza go into creative?
2 weeks later tommy hits 7 million and more
14:45 IN HERE PURBERTY NEVER ENDS
Love that more youtubers are using persona 5 music

15:05 👏
14:25 tommyinit are you really locating it. I mean I understand you have to get through with the video but at least cut it out
Why is Phil the only one who does anything in these?
The amount of times they went into creative mode.
19:41 best part
that ending music was cool dude
Let's just forget the "set gamemode to survival" on Tommy's screen at 5:39
not tommy searching up what the nearest fortress is 14:25
14:24 did anyone else notice the locate command
7:42 they set philzas mode to creative... they cheated?

Wilbursoot: The story/mad man creator Slimecicicle: Y e s TommyInnit: Messing around Phi1zaMinecraft: *INTENSE DREAM MUSIC*

MrBeast is satan confirmed?
The brash birthday compatibly wink because newsstand unfortunately haunt upon a cheap apparel. ignorant, efficient candle
tommy way did u set philzas mode to creative
i just realized that i paused the video where the subtitle says "fuck this"and my mom saw that and i thought "this is so awkward"
tommy did said that if you wanna unsubscribe then you can but i am saying if any one unsubscribed from this channel please drop your address with your phone number in the comment section :)
The friendly noodle concurrently complete because overcoat microcephaly compete towards a woebegone warm. bouncy, unnatural authorization
lol
11:25    Tommy: tides in the ocean!   Me: I SIT AND WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT SONG
I hate you
7:24 Tommy’s face 😭💀

Ha, I’m 14 and got all the poison reference
Im 14
I’m 10 and knew all those songs help me save me
20:23 “what’s the most obscure reference we can make that tommy’s fans won’t understand?” “Oh we could do um- with the taste—“ Me who watched Dan and Phil: OF YOUR LIPS IM ON A RIIIIIIIDE YOURE TOXIC IM SLIPPIN UNDERRRR
13:14 Does anyone else think this whole moment with slimecicle and wilbur is actually really intense and well-done?
@MrBeast

Why in these normally do they not help TUBBO FROM WILLBERSOOOOOOT
A brutal end for Dr. Sicle for the sake of science. *Salute*
eLiZa

ITS PULLING THE SNOW FROM ABOVE MY FEET!!!  glad to know the snow was above you      cause it wasn’t
Wilbur said “there all 14” Me: “I’m 11.....I’m literally 11- whatever”
After seeing the morph mod video, if I see Charlie in a video I immediately click on it. No. Questions. Asked.
Lol
" Im going in a black hole"
slimecicle u cheat and wilbur i saw u go creative :/
4:05 I install tinder illegally  5:02 male chickens don’t lay eggs
"With the taste of your lips I'm on a ride" -Charlie and Wilbur Me:"YOUR TOXIC-"

“IN HERE PUBERTY NEVER ENDS!” -slimesicle 2021
Tommy put philza in creative

Wilbur and slimecicle roleplay while tommy and phil try to survive a black hole

Wilbur's last words were "DONT STOP-"
Everybody:AHHH HELP Philza: *dream speed run music*
I can't help but think it's Dr. Circle than Dr. Cicle.
7:24
DUDE THEY GOT THE P5 SOUNDTRACK!!!!!!!!!! ITS SOOO GOOOOOD!!!!
Phil is the only one being serious. Such a old man
tommyinnit copy and paste format: ___________is stupidly funny
My favourite tommyinnit mod video is the lava ravine mod!!
“ *oh wait British boy* ” 😭😭😭
Wilbur is using fullbright mod
21:42 was so intense and dramatic
In VR beat saber today I was in the middle of a song and my controller died at the last second and I died in the song 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
OMG I just realize that he’s the same age as my sister 😁😀😃😁
Mrbeast watching this like "👁👄👁"
Wilbur was playing clash royale!! My two hobbies COMBINE! (:
i love that Wilbur and Charlie thought that gen z kids would not know toxic and tic tok
I love how wilbur and charlie made three references that they thought a 14-year-old wouldn't get and I got two of the three.
people said, tommy is annoying, But actually i find him fun X'D I wish i can be his friend 🥺 TOMMY! LEMME BE YER FRENNDDD
*my brother told me to check out your channel and now im glad i did.*
I loved the part where they sung famous 2010 hit tik tok by ke$ha
Bruh yes the just cause 3 music fits perfectly
"In here puberty never ends!!!" -Charlie 2021
I literally 14 and understood all of those songs LMFAO
20:31  me a twelve year old watching this at 12:32 am: *some are twelve*  also me: *jams out to Toxic*
7:12 that backwards Latin actually translates to “English sentence that is true in Latin”
owo    Oop-
nice mario galaxy music
Poor tommy he seemed pissed at the end
i really hope that philza just genuinely enjoys gathering resources and beating the game because hes the one who always ends up doing it lmao
Eu vreau să îl văd pe Google nu pe tine
Famous last words: "hee hee"
a poptart is a breakfast ravioli
Its satisfying Tommyinit screaming
20:06 this scene looks epicly awesome but also very terrifying. imagine you seeing this irl.
And I am 10
Am I the only one that thought why don’t they got to the nether
20:06  Tommy:''I can't even see it'' Black hole:"see what bitch?"
that back words text thing says "damnationem latine hoc est verum latine" witch i think means "English sentence that is true"
Wilbur on the other side of the world doing things in the name of science then Tommy over there thinking of being a black hole
It’s crazy to see how much you have grown in the past year. I was here since 200k, keep up the grind...
tommy: the content slimecicle: the funny  wilbur: the semi serious philiza: the reason they win
Can I just say the part where it was raining and Tommy was looking for the black hole and lightning lit up the back of it, that was terrifying
UwU
Does anyone else realize that they play cuphead music
Last time I checked it's 7.21M subscribers
Lol
I like how there making fun of Tommy saying funny
The mod ain’t funny your funny!
21:48 that was really intense lol
i love who this video is just a roast to Mr beast
13:40 is a truly tense scene of the cinematic universe. truly scarring
title “very funny” me during the whole video 😑🥱😐
charlie singing my name is something i didn’t know i needed but i’m glad it’s happened. 20:44
Did he just kill the dragon with a iron sword
Yall failed at making references I dont understand and im 13
16:40 They Cheated....
Wilbur and Charlie: *scientists* Phil: *cool about the black hole* Tommy: *BEING FUCKING DRAMATIC*
The freaking intro is so f******** sick
I knew the songs they sang and I’m born in 2009
the fact that i grew up playing jetpack joyride when i was younger hits different. only the baddest bitches played it
1:19 (random number to skip to)
14:28 omg tommy has a freaking 3090.... the hecc
7:54 Creative Mode-
The ending always makes me diiiieee
Tommy’s like everyone’s 16-18 and me just sitting there like I’m 12 O-O and I knew the two songs I didn’t know the Eliza one tho
Wilbur and Slime: Lets make references Tommy's fans will never get.   Me: Gets all the references and is disappointed in them for not challenging my brain
the raw cinematic beauty of the black hole getting backlit by the lightning lives rent free in my brain
the editor messed up on the colors: 4:45 9:59
When phil is trading with the piglins, is that Will Power from persona 5 in the background?
At 7:54 Tommy put phillza in creative
I was born in 2008 and knew all the songs
Where’s dream
“Let’s sing something Tommy’s fans wouldn’t understand” Me: ^finishing all the songs lyrics they said^
Im 15, born 2006, I understood all of wilbur and charlie's references
pfft I got all Wilbur's references and I'm ten
Do a jojo bizzare adventure mod
guys i'm almost 16 could anyone tell me what they're singing... is it by major lazer
"We bully nerds here right charile? Let's do basketball and drugs." Tommy- 2021
3:32 in the backround Ph1lza alone fighting the irob golem
Only me remembering when Tommy used to go around Hypixel lobbys spamming his stream?
No one absolutely no one: Phil: beating the game while everyone is messing around
'I'ma going in a black hole' Funniest like ever
When u first see tommyinit: the hell there is no jokes in the intro how can this person be good Then: OmG hahah
My friends friend is addicted with you
How did I get from cars rolling over to wilbur soot getting sucked up by a black hole...
Im ten
Fun fact, according to Google translate/editor Larry, Wilbur said this: “Damnationem latine hoc est verum latine” which translated to “English sentence that is true in Latin”
I’m literally 9
"I'm getting sucked"          Tommyinit
Actually I’m 11
i love when there like his fans are 14 years old but im just here like im 11 years old and i know all the songs there singing 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Me age 15 and getting all these references they're making
Why did you bleep out cocaine but didn’t bleep out fuck 😂
"We beat up nerds around here isnt that right Charlie? Now lets go play basketball and do drugs" I- *INSERT WHEEZE*
tommy:LOOK at this obsidian phil its the strongest block in the game!  bedrock:am i a joke to you?
so what mr. beast told wilbur was along the lines of “this is a sentence in latin” or “damnationem latine hoc est verum latine”. good to know. how threatening.
Philza is always be the mvp
was so confused when charlies subtitles turned purple
You have 7mil subs,congrats! I have said this twice in your vids and I'm telling you again...you have 7 mil subs!!!!!!!
wait- you had 7,09 mil yesterday. THATS 0,3 MIL SUBS IN ONE DAY ?! :O
Tomy: there's a giant black hole Me: that's what she said
My favourite trend in these videos is Philza doing all of the work while Tommy, Wilbur and their guest just fuck around the entire time.
hi
Definition of noise:    Tommy   Definition of annoying:     Annoying
Tommy some are 14 some are 16 me:11
Once again, they won solely because of Phil 😂
I can’t breathe from the scenes of Slimecicle and Wilbur Soot.......
They were gonna get a schollar to king's college, but Charlie died.
*”Hee-hee, OH-“* *That cracked me up 😂😂😂*
20:05 *EPIC*
Remember, when tommy reaches 10M subs he has to install tinder 🥸
Dudes its disgusting that im younger than tommy and am going through puberty hard
The songs ik they were singing Toxic Dont Remember the name tik tok and im a pre-teen almost a teen
I’m 11 and I understand the references- I’m fucked up
Hey Tommy, what app do u use to edit ur videos. I just started my channel and I would like something to edit my videos on. Cheers.
#wehadtoridofoursheeptommycried1940

The sentence wilbur said translates to “This is an english sentence in Latin”
I’m 13 and I get it all like bruh
Are we not going to realise tommy put Phil a in creative a 7:51 😂😂😂😂
Its sad knowing that will thinks I don't know tiktok (by Kesha (I hate that I have to clarify this)) and toxic just cuz I was born in 2007 despite the fact that he doesn't even know of my existence
im 12
SEVEN MİLİON subscriber
he he AH OH!
philza goes so hard every challenge, meanwhile tommy roleplays, charlie puns, and wilbur starts cults. such a great dynamic
im 13 and I understood all the references that apparently 14 year olds wouldn't know LMAOO
Does anybody realize that he uses the same face in every thumbnail for the past 5 videos
I see that editor larry likes persona 5
You are a fool
Did Tommy’s editor just censor a n-word on 0:38? Why? Why now if the child he is working with is swearing every minute without stopping and I haven’t seen another censor in his video?
20:10 Chrome plated afterburner or money jetpack
Congrats on 7 mill
UMMMMMMM UHHHHH 14:24
this dude gets more than 1M a day
Noice That he have 7millon  subcibers

I remember when tommy was just at 500k a couple months ago
Polar bear
wilbur singing ke$ha is one of my favorite things ever

Tommy and Phil: having a conversation about tinder and dating   Wilbur and charlie: “Top 10 most serious anime momentsl
ELIZAAA AND PEGGY
Wilbur: What's a reference Tommy's fans wouldn't get? Wilbur: Ima get a scholarship to king's college- Tommy and Wilbur during the L'Manburg war: literally just making Hamilton references the entire time
Wilbur: I've seen into the stars. And they laughed at me.  Dramatic Music Plays  Tommy: Wanna play basketball with us?
Funny how I'm 15 and I know the songs they are singing :'D
i think i know who its following halo 1 music intensifies
20:30 well i’m 14 hi

‎
PHILZA IS POG

Tommyinnit trying to be calm.

9:12 to be honest the way he says indestructible- it’s cool
11:53-12:52
'I was in the forest just looking for some tasty mud'  -TommyInnit -2021
7 MILLION CONGRATS MATE
Vere fune tête-à-tête
1:22 Famous last words  "Hee hee"
When you’re 14 and understand all their references
"Ive not seen it at this size..."  *Orgasmic noises*
When the lightning revealing the black hole was something straight out of a horror movie
I think Tommy is a little to young to get the suck
20:34 i dont understand becouse i'm from México
20:27 i'm 11
this video kinda... *sucks*
I swear when Tommy said that wilbur was like a brother to him I was WAITING to hear wil say "don't say that I'll cry"
So They Watch Pitch PERFECT 😭
I watched this while eating SPOGETY 🤣
Ima goin in a black hole
Youre annoing
I remember when tommy replied to me on Twitter when he hit 5k followers
I accidentally watched the video over on an imposter channel
8:30 I know Tommy is pretending to be an idiot a a joke and all that, but... Seriously? The black hole suck up _BEDROCK_ and you're acting like 2 pieces of obsidian is going to do ANYTHING?
I feel like that part where they almost got consumed was most clutch thing I’ve seen in my life
“You don’t wanna get sucked by the black hole”
WYM DOWNLOAD TINDER?

Here at 7mil congrats!
The music in this one is amazing. Does anyone know what music it is? Specifically the cinematic ones.
7:49 [Tommyinnit Set Ph1lza Game Mode To Creative]
the fact that wilbur and charlie don’t think we know “old” songs like toxic and stronger is sad :((
Tommy: going 1 mph in a boat. Philza: "That's 16 pearls lets go".

I just love that it always come down to Wilbur making a cult and recruiting charlie to do his dirty work/experiments, Tommy being the ✨Noise✨and waddling along with Phil and Phil being the only one actually trying to beat the game lol.

Why not make a player a black hole who can fly around and absorb the world
Tommy: "I can't even see it."  Game: Makes lightning strike, causing the black hole to look both epic as h€ll and scary as fuck at the same time.
7:08  Wilbur: Damnationem latine Hoc eet verum latine Me: .....*puts it into google translate for the heck of it* Google translate: At this sentence is true in Latin fleet Me: 0.0 .....what???
20:06 was a lot like a horror movie
Them “there all 14” me being 12 😔
when slime and wilbur tried to reference stuff we wouldnt know, i knew literally all of them lol

Just so you know some subscribers are 10
7:13  funny did laugh

20:34 literally every 14 year old knows this because this is in tiktok and edits isnt it

Like is anyone just laughing so much because Tommy screamed as a girl when he saw the black whole and when they started singing Hamilton and Kesha 😂
Wilbur: All Tommy's fans are 14 they won't know these songs... Me (a 14yr old): *singing all the songs*
4:46 wrong color lol
this is the greatest video ever
damnationem latine hoc est verum latine is what wilby said

most epic is stop stop stop go go go 19:17 6x go 19:21 19:28 mini p.e.k.k.a sounds 19:33 Wilbur won 19:37 Wilbur forgot he was near black hole 20:04 Phil nether 20:07 shout 20:11 jetpack joyride 20:31 starting funny 20:39 make me stronger 20:56 ok 21:15 party 21:22 super epic 21:50 end
It’s funny how fast Wilbur can go from fun to really ominous. (Example: 6:18
6.9 mil subscription  Nice!
6.9 million pog we like 69
the most epic part of the vid 21:28
20:30 The fact that I am 14 and used to play just dance to this song religiously...
4:10 Tinder
I am reborn
I’m 2007 liner and i understood everyone of those references-
by the time i comment this tommy is at 6.9 MIL SUBSCRIBERS OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Wilbur royale
Funny how tommy has 6.9m subscribers
Funny how tommy has 6.9m subscribers
I subscribed and liked and Notifications
I’m actually 14 but I got all those references
Wilbur I am quite affected by your statement as a Tommyinnit fan I know all of the songs >:(
Welp
Þere was not a single warthog running in this video, I am disappointed
7:52 hacks?
0:16 i dont think you want someone you hate to subscribe to you.
Did MrBeast pay people to be demons down there in hell? Because let’s be real, it’s the most logical way he can get demons to worship him
16:30 Is that Just Cause 3 music I’m hearing?
I swear every month this man is getting one million more subs
When i heard Will Power play i started to like Tommy even more.
You don’t want to be sucked by the black hole. 😣👏🏼
But I wanted to know what the other thing tommy is scared of was
'Tell me what Mr beast said to you in hell' Me who figured out the subtitles were latin backwards: It literally says "English sentence" and "This is true in latin"     Also me: Ok then Btw I did use google translate, but I am currently learning Latin and it did look about right 👍👍
Tommy, The black hole is called Sagittarius A
“DIE FOR SCIENCE WILBUR” “WE HAVE CRACKED THE CODE YESSS”    “ *im building a shack* ”     edit: *indestructible shack*
Drugs
"They all 14" ...Damn i didnt know i was that old-  But like they have good tastes in music-
wilbur: all of tommy’s fans are 14 which means they were born in 2006. what’s something that will confuse them? *proceeds to sing songs that i, a fourteen year old that was born in 2006 knows all the lyrics to
Went from 6.33 to 6.88, POGGG
wow okay mrbeast
Wilbur: the scientist Slimecicle: the assistant Philza: the resources Tommy: the noise
wrong im 10
They lost their lives but they won the battle
"Obsidian it's the strongest block in game" bedrock: 👁️💧👄💧👁️
Who else saw that they turned into creative mide
Lol
Man we need quakity
Karl shouldn’t have a mic
11:30 😂😂😂😂😂😂
1:25 "i'm going in a black hole" by the way I just find out that like a month ago Tommy haved 5M subs, now he have 6.87M (my mind when i saw that:MMMMMMMMAGIC)
The fact I know all these songs BRUH
I got the reference.
This here is the sequel to the laser eyes mod. When Wilbur fed the void it gained enough energy to rise to the surface. When it first got to the surface, it was very minuscule, too small to see.
Its all Mr Beast? Always has been
Hi :)
I understood the reference. It's TikTok by ke$ha if you are curious.
When they made Hamilton references I felt that
Well wilbur and Charlie failed to make me not know the song cause that song that they were singing was tiktok by kesha they also died soooo i win haha
Is ur guys fav word is f#$k
Wha- Wilbur.... *Wheeze*
There all 14 me being the only 10 yaer old here🙄
When the cuphead music kicks In
i get all the old references and im a young tommy fan-
I couldn’t not cry from laughter when I realized Tommyinnit lowkey gave me Troy Bolton vibes
Did anyone else get “Wither Storm” vibes when Tommy said the black hole was following him?
You did not die in the dream smp????
"hEHeE- OH OHH- *dies*"
"This is the tides in the ocean"     Or atleast I think, or am I dead wrong?    (11:25)
The world would've ended when the thing appeared.
Wilbur: *calling all Tommy's fans 14 year olds and singing old songs they wouldn't know* Me: *one of the few 18 year olds jamming along to the music*
I want this mod-
ALEXANDER HAMILTON!!!!!!!!!!!!
Where’s the innit part
Sometimes, Tommy, your the only thing that pulls me threw the day You all help me smile and laugh, never stop. never give up. Even if it feels like its not worth it, keep pulling threw 'cause it is worth it Thats what I need to tell myself every day. And Tommy, you and your friends are one of the reasons why I wait for tomarrow. If you wait for tomarrow, I'll wait with you.
20:06 the lightning strike illuminating the black hole was a little creepy ngl
you know it gets serious when persona 5 music starts playing 17:29
im 10 and a big fan of tommyinnit
Tommy’s titles: bla bla bla bla bla funny
Wait, so there's lore to this now? Is Keith Canon?

Tommy is now my physics instructor, which is cool.
When they couldn't see the black hole and the lightning struck, revealing it... that was terrifying

I would love to see you guys do the Scape & Run: Parasites mod :D
16:00 Why is there the Just Cause 3 music?!!😂😂
The fact that I’m turning 13 this summer and understood all those references may be the reason I don’t have many friends
Rip bro hop u make a come back on the smp

Anyone else noticed Tommy is pulling almost the exact same face in his thumbnails recently-?   Just me?   Ok-

Damn it all. I never thought I'd subscribe to tommyinnit, but he's the only youtuber who regularly uploads content with the people who are actually funny :(  Nevertheless, there's clearly something to be said for those lucky few who can gather a community around them, and use them to make something greater than themselves, so for that, I salute you, and I subscribe.
I knew all the songs wilbur and Charlie was singing lol
Hey tommy did some re search on you your 6 foot 1 and your zodiac sign is Aries which is if u search it up its traits its  Strengths: Courageous, determined, confident, enthusiastic, optimistic, honest, passionate. Its like u in the Dream SMP in every war :)

I love how they say that everyone is 14 on Tommy's channel, and so none of us would get the songs, but I am a year away from 14 and was singing along with all the songs.

Lol just started watching him since he started tweeting ksi and I'm absolutely loving him
Tommy ther is a blue vlog gun🤯
I find you funny :)
Hey Tommy. I know you will probably.. never see this. But if that 1 in a million chance happens to happen I just wanted to let you know something.    I have been struggling with depression and an ED for a while now. My parents don't allow me to have twitch so I have to rely on YouTube. But everytime I see you, Dream, George, Wilbur, or Sapnap post something new.. it makes me really happy. There are times when I can't even get out of bed, brush my teeth, eat and I come on to one of your channels and I just feel so so so much better. I'm honestly crying as I write but I just really need you and all your friends to know that you are amazing, kind, beautiful people who have made mine and so many others lives better just by being you. I love your humor, and your jokes and you all make me feel like I'm not alone. Thank you guys for being such amazing people.   If I'm being honest you guys are my role models.   There are times when I've eaten, gotten out of bed, got motivated, stopped myself from relapsing dozens of times because of you and everyone else. You don't understand the impact you have had in my life.  If I'm being 100% honest I would be dead if it weren't because you guys made me laugh, smile or feel good about myself. I would've never gotten to know my gf or my baby cousin. Thank you. For being a role model and an inperational person for me and so many others. Dont listen to the hate. Be yourselves no matter what.   Sam. (They/he)

Alternative title: Philza tries to best the game while Tommy, Wilbur and Charlie mess around with a massive black wierd hole thing
Almost 7 mil! Good job tommy!
This sucks how do you find this entertaining
U seem like this is not funny to you and you are stressed ALOT
about Tommy... Judging by the facts, it really can be excluded.. but it seems to me that maybe his ghost will haunt him in his Dreams, or he (Tommy) will be in a certain place, and sometimes come to the streams of other  of Smp...Tubbo and Phil will be depressed because of his death, Captain Puffy and the others will be grieving, and they will mate: "He did a lot for us, so let's fulfill his dream, get rid of the egg and live in peace" Dream might somehow escape, and then, when they got on his trail, he would blow up the WHOLE of lmamberg to hell, and then it would turn out that Tommy was actually controlling the egg, and Dream was going to kill the egg once and for all, and specifically persuaded Schlat and our Mexican Boy to banish Will and Tommy, so that Will would realize that it wasn't Tommy      Sorry for my English 🙏 I'm from Russia
this vid is like stranger things
Are you ghostinnit or are you gone forever or are you getting revived I need to knowwwww
tommy is just a kid stupid KID GO STUDY
Deadinnit.
Tommy posttttttt stream so somethingggggg we want to know what’s happened

So this is the guy that died recently, I can see why dream hates him now! (This is a joke, I am not simping for dream nor Tommy they are both amazing creators)
Jimmy the black hole god.
I’m sad that tommy got killed and now dream has the power 😭😭😢😢😭😭😢😭🥺
Will you post again after the death

Tommyinnit: I’m friends with Technoblade I’m friends with Vikkstar I’m friends with GeorgeNotFound I’m friends with Mr.Beast
This my first time on his channel and all I saw was the exact same thumbnails
I loved how the Halo 3 soundtrack was playing
Wilbur: "Yeah his fans are all 14"                                                                                                                                                            me being 11: "🥴👍"
The stuff you said at the start why was mario music playing in the background
let me guess before i watch the video... its very funny
I am 14 and I got all of the Wilbur and Charlie’s refrences😂😂
So bri ish
I’m 13 and knew all those songs-
POV: You are on this video to see people comment about Tommy’s canon death       How many subs can I get from this comment? Current subs 255
The ritzy title philosophically replace because blow phylogentically suck times a harsh shield.  flippant, lazy carp
looking for some nice mud to eat      tommyinnit 2021
I just realized in all of his thumbnails he has no eyes😬
Wilbur: I have seen into the blackened eye. tommy: you wanna go shoot some hoops?
that was so stressful lmao
:) now Go say "Hi" To Schlatt in "Hell"  "Just Saw A Child Die, Feeling Good"
is that just cause 3 audio at 16:30?
Truly disgusting that MrBeast would do this horrible thing.
21:22 HOLY S*** RUN TOMMY RUN F***ING RUN

how does it feel like to be dead
phantommy
the fact that tommy got a 3090 and didnt even make a video ;(
Just wanna say Tommy is such a legend for uploading this consistently while still having school and what not. Tommy still manages to make me laugh so hard throughout all of his videos. I've been watching since 2018 and ever since his he did skyblock I've been wanting to start doing YT as well. I just finished editing my first video so I hope I can do well! Thanks Tommy!!
The best part is definitely how the black hole was ominously revealed when the entire sky flashed, the black hole being the only part staying dark. 20:06
am love with your hair 👁️👄👁️👍❤️

Wilbur & Charlie: *making references to songs* My parents who made me listen to all their old songs: :L
Tommy rest in peace
...why did almost get every refrance..
To Charlie and Wilbur : I understood that reference and in 14 btw that was cringe :)
RIP Tommyinnit
Most of the songs wilbur sung and said 14 year olds wint understand im 14 and i understood most of them
Here when’s he dead
The way he’s said “I watched a video how to build one a tutorial if you will” just was so funny
There was sad piano music playing when slimecicle died and I was like "that's sad" then I realized I'm still in class
I'm so stretched out that I can feel this whole entire bowl  Me: mom why is there a YouTuber in my SpaghettiOs

kirk hammett be like: 8:21
1:22 Slimesicle Jackson
I should be doing homework but this is worth more of my time
I was born 2006 and was singing all the song they were :D
the funniest part is that all of the meme references that were meant to confuse us were exactly in the time frame that 14~16 year olds remember VIVIDLY
in fucking 10
Tommy, as a fellow Brit, I have a proposal.  How about I can be your partner hm? My yt channel can be _____innit, lol  Do take this into consideration 😁
Black Hole! You owe me a banana! (props if you get the reference)
gg tommy
Tommy and the bois are being idiots while philza is being that one nerd in the group
rip
Ghostinnit :(
I'm your biggest fan tommyinnit💃🏻
21:24 to 22:04 is quite intense
Im getting volts flashbacks
Philza: actually plays the game.  Everyone else: experiments with the black hole
did no one see the "the nearest fortress it at" in 14:20 into the video lol
How uncultured do Mr. Cicle and Mr. Soot think we are lmao
Am I the only person who noticed that wilburs and Charlie’s text colors were switched at some times
She’s in your bed but I’m in her twitch chat. 🎸🎸I got the keys and he’s just a doormat🎸🎸
“Wilber” LOL
*I'MA GOIN' IN THE BLACK HOLE*
Seeing as i am born in 2006, I can say that I understand all the references, just because we’re born later does not mean we live under a rock
Imagine what would happen if quackity got involved in thisblack hole mod.
You are here after Tommy died
TOMMY I'M ONE OF YOUR BIGGEST FANS
8:16 We “cracked” the code bois!
What is happening to the subtitles?
The words Wibur says at 7:07 are the latin words "damnationem latine hoc est verum latine" which in english means "English sentence that is true in Latin".
THIS IS WHAT MRBEAST SAID IN HELL. YES,   I TRANSLATED IT: English sentence that is true in Latin
If they did tommy wilbur and charlie vs phil then who would win
Tommy you very bad at among I'm 11 and I win eays why you lose
Mister beast on the side 😂
I just watched tommy's death i cried :c
Got into a car crash not feelin good
Wilbur is getting more manipulative every mod video.
I love how Wilbur and Charlie think that us 14 year olds don't know them songs of by heart
Fuck you tommy bc of you dream world's were destroyed by you you mother fucker
I really think you should check midmystick out, she’s been wanting to join the dream smp

Tommy be careful, ur blood pressure is always dropping (i mean sometimes) be safe
Phil w 3 stacks of gold lol. Creative who?

11:59 MW them song
At 7:52 PH1LzA is set to creative mode
Rip tommyinnit 2004/2021
Why is no one talking about how at 5:39 Slimecicle set his GAMEMID TO SURVIVAL. That means he was in creative...
*boobyinnit*
that halo music really got me riled up
I would laugh but Tommy is just a kid and these dudes are not influencing him very well
hold up right there Tommy just used locate command at 14:24
For your next video idea:dont curse and badboyhalo shall be calm at once 🙃

How are you alive
I'm eleven and I'm your fan. I'm even on your discord
Ok. Listen up here, Tommy. Lately, your Discord server has got very toxic. So toxic in fact, that I got banned for making a comeback, and the people that insulted me didn't even get banned at all. I suggest you need to fix that.
3:46 ''I have time cuz I'm young''  This aged well
Tommy you remember when you was at discord in eret i was bullying at you lol
I don’t know but nobody noticed them cheating to get items and locate places
How does it feel te get killed by dream💀
RIP Tommy you were too young to die😔
That part when the black hole comes into the stronghold was kinda lit bish
Charlies Micheal Jackson impression was actually spot on-
Why does Wilbur remind me of a British Ted nivision
Tommy were is your Girlfriend!!!!!!
i thought i was subbed,but i wasnt!! so i subbed
R.I.P
Hello Tommy I'm a massive fan of you and wilbur soot have a nice day :-)
let's confuse the early 2000's kids. *Proceeds to sing early 2000's hits*

Fun fact: The process of compression and stretching from a strong gravitational field, such as a black hole, is called spaghettification, so Charlie wasn't really wrong.

Philz’s: Your fans are all 14. They won’t get the reference Me: I’m 14 but still get the reference.

7:08 - The backwards text says "damnationem latine, hoc est verum latine" and translates from Latin as "English sentence, that is true in Latin.", according to google translate. (although it's most probably wrong in some capacity)

Tommyinnit 2036: Your Life is Very Funny
Tommy idk if your reading but you know how deep my love runs for lmanburg, for a project we had to write a letter in school  and you know what address I put in 15 lane road lmanburg yeah I named my city after lmanburg 😢.    I heard there was a special place, where men could go emancipate, the brutality, and tyranny of their rulers. Well, this place is real, you needn't fret, with Wilbur, Tommy, Tubbo, f Eret A very big and, a little bit blown up, L'Manburg   My L'Manberg My L'Manberg My L'Manberg My L'Manberg My L'Manberg   For freedom and for liberty. Our nation sought to build on these, and victory for all under freedom. Trouble came and then it went, we built our walls and watched them break, And from everywhere from here up to forever.  [Chorus]  L'Manberg L'Manberg L'Manberg  L'Manberg

The unadvised index neurally suffer because music methodologically deceive at a guarded beast. humdrum, quirky advice
I didn't get why tommy says that most people find him annoying at first. After I watched a lot of his videos I realized I just found a twin with the same amount of crackhead energy. This is for the mha weebs:👍🏻ಡ﹏ʖ ಡ👍🏻

Will becomes a satanist/mrbeast fan Charlie comes back from the void Tommy takes it relatively seriously Philza gambles with a bunch of piglins
Charlie: Hee hee!- OH  Also Charlie: *Ima going in a black hole!*

Sad reality of world :- No one finds tommyinit annoying

"THE BLACK HOLE IS CONTROLLING ME!!" *What in the stranger things-*
Black hole: exists Philza: tryharding  Tommy: stresses Slime and WIlbur: IMA GET A SCHOLARSHIP TO KING'S COLLEGE
i totally forgot philza was there still... 7:12
I am your pogchamp
nobody: tommy in his thumbnails for the last 20 videos: 😆😂
tommy is the funnny ist youtuberت
"damnationem latin hoc est varum latine" (7:05)  Literally translates to: "English sentence that is true in latin"  Why did I take the time to actually translate the backwards latin?     *I'm avoiding homework.*
Tommy: where is wilbur? Slimecicle: oh he straight up died Tommy: I don't believe that, watch this. WILBUR SOOT IS LIKE A BROTHER TO ME Wilbur"s corpse:  Tommy: oh shit
I'AM CRYINGGGG
*truly inspirational*
Slimecicle looked so good to in this video
"Go speak to Karl Jacobs bitch fuck you"  I-    I giggled just like Karl just now-
Mr.Beast Is the only god now
incredible how Professor Wilbur and Dr.Cicle look so much like Rick and Morty
7:08 English sentence that is true in Latin
Tommy what's your favorite song?
Go look at the dream up data short videos dean reveals his face plz and give me a shout out plz plz thank you and tommy your are amazing and kinda cute 😋✌
#tommyinnit
2:31 lol
Am i the only 1  that sees     Gamemode set to survival?
Hey
robucx
you know how in the lazer eyes video wilber was feeding the void well it has now come to the surface  IT WANTS TO FEED MORE!!!!!!!!
Today is march 1 / Sapnap AND Philza's birthday
As if Tommy has more subscribers than technoblade
i just realized.....   *tommy has more subscribers than technoblade*
holy cow!! look at all those subscribers! pog!!!!
OK but the fact that there's Persona 5 battle music playing as Phil is in the underworld fighting the blazes is perfection 👌
5:10 has the same energy of the  "Oh she passed away, awww, awww, Oh well"
i like how tommy gives phil creative mode
why you game mode you tommy to fill
Remember
every time I see a new video he goes up another million.
im playing fnf while watching this...
as a 15 year old I understood every single one of Charlies and Will's references
Tommys latest videos are just people having fun and phil working lol
CHAT HELP THE BLACK HOLE IS AFFECTING MY PHONE THE VIDEO IS BUFFERING😭
I'm 14 lol
at this point I think hes sub botting
no comments
WIlbur plays Clash Royale POG!!
Nobody:   Philza trying to beat the game while everyone else are following the script
<3 the subtitles
Nobody is first, except for tommy because he’s the one who recorded it
“why is it flaring up?“
Tommy: shouting every 5 seconds Wilbur: dying every 5 seconds Charlie: doing something annoying every 5 seconds  Philza: actually trying to finish the game
oh mr.beast
Can we talk about how tommys last 10 thumbnails look the same
Anyone Else notice that Tommy used /Locate Fortress at 14:25?
the fact that they thought we wouldnt know britney spears toxic is just offensive
brohd go back to dream smp
I'm 14 and incredibly mad. I have danced to all those songs on Just Dance on the Wii🖕🖕🖕
Yo.  I dont know if its good but i am 20 yo and i watch it a lot. From Poland ;) i hope that i am not the only one XD
Omg Thomas im also born in april
pog
Pog
Phil is just being a Persona Protagonist with a 100% play through
Pog
anyone else actually know all the lyrics to the original songs will and Charlie were singing to
Tommy: *Has low blood pressure* Also Tommy: *Says his blood pressure is dropping* Me: ARE YOU JOKING OR NOT ARE YOU OKAY????
The seemly copper pathogenetically notice because hemp individually divide unto a nonstop august. abusive, lewd summer
My abs are hurting....    Oh wait I had coffee, my stomach is in pain

Guys, I think I know how to time travel
Angy boy tommy
black HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLE
I love it how every time they do a mod video, Philza is the only one who gets progressed
First!!
*"Lets confuse TommyInnit's fans!!"*  **starts singng toxic*   Me(12)singing along:  **"YOUR TOXIC LOVE-"**     hAhA, yOu fAilEd
it went from "i'm friends with georgenotfound" to "i'm friends with mrbeast"
Me: a 14 year old     Tommy: let me reference something that all the 14 year olds won’t understand       Also me: singing along 🤠✋
Wilbur and Charlie: sang toxic for a few seconds because they thought tommy's viewers wouldn't understand me who has heard it before i became a fan of Tommy: you underestimate my power
How and why did I know every reference Charlie and Wilbur made?
did wilbur watch a doctor who episode before he came into this or something
Tommy: some are 16. Some are 18. Me: I am ten you f**ckers
Doesnt everyone just love the Halo and Cod music?
"MY BLOOD PRESSURE IS DROPPING!" oh sh*t
Guess what sidemen are better than you
Sometimes I think Phils The Only Adult In The Group
Tommy your a legend
persona 5 music nice
tommy is the king of funniest mods ever
I am 8 and I watch you
"That ice looks awfully lot like ice cream. We should crash into it for romance and drama."  *Titanic music intensifies*
Why youtube censored my password? ***********
Get a scholarship to kings college
Did Tommy use Just cause three music
Philza is so bland
21:29 that moment when you want to know the music but you can't find anything saying what music it is: why we still here? just to suffer
but i dont went to unsubsribers
wilbur
Tommyinnit i love your videos. There so cool.
That whole bit where Charlie and Wilbur were singing songs Tommy's fans wouldn't know and they're all on my throwback (elementary, dear watson) playlist  edit: I'm seventeen :)
He was long and then he was gone. He went wide and then he died.
Tommyinnit is some how going to make the timber mod funny
why do you look like you're taking a massive shit in all your thumbnails?
i knew all of those songs im 13 lmao (21 mins i think)
Hi thomaty
I am 13
lets play basketball and do drugs :):):)
imagine just getting diamonds then you die. OR you get an iron helmet and say "HE-HE IMA DIE-E-E-E"
14:24 "the nearest nether fortress is at"
/time set 2013           sorry, you do not have permission to use that command.
Actually, the fact that the black hole sucks in not only blocks and creatures, but also items, is useful if you plan to use ender pearls, as their trajectory would also depend on how far away the black hole is
My favorite bit was the “if-then” statements I remember in school I hated science and this just made it 100x better. If I were to ever like science it would be under the teaching of Dr. Sicle and Profesor Soot
a’ight people, we have Sleepy Bois Inc.   what’s this group’s name?
Wilbur comes back from Hell tommy asks him if he wants to shoot some hoops.
10:07 Wilbur went to survival so that means he went to creative
that lightning shining the black hole when they were at the ice area was amazing
twatinit
Post on dream smp
Tommyinnit I dare you to let me join the dream smp I was one of your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube so plz maybe let me on
you literally won 100k subscribers in fucking 3 days
Tommy’s next title be like:  The murder mod is the most funny thing EVER?
5:39 slimecicle sus switch to survival
Wow all the references that wilbur and charlie made I understood--as a 14 year old.
every time a mod yall cheat
No one..  Phil: Hey charlie ...how do u want to die ?  like ...is there smth wrong bahahahahah
Yo copying dream

Truly disgusting that MrBeast would do this horrible thing.
you just see in the corner that tommy set philzas  gamemode to creative lmao 7:52
"I've got my college essay due tomorrow" anybody remember that?
21:29 - 21:54 completely epic especially 21:49 in my opinion

19:10
TOMAYE TRUSTAY
Into the unknown
U are so funny
who else lined DON'T STOP by wilbur up with TiK ToK
I appreciate how the halo theme is here
Not funny😐
Tommy at the start of the video: u can unsubscribe later even though who ever subscribes is just addicted to his videos
I went to google translate cuz i was curious and this is what Wilbur said: "damnationem latine hoc est verum latine" which translates to "English sentence that is true in Latin"
philza : beats the dragon them : die for science of the egg
Give me my chicken nuggies
And you thought we wouldn’t understand Hamilton
Tommy: they're not all 14 some are 16 some are eighteen Me: intense sweating because i'm 12
tommy i like ur vids but u keep swearing so I cant watch them :?
are we gonna talk about how charlie swapped colors with wilbur towards the beginning for like one sentence
does ever mod video need some storyline in it? :/
I like how at 12:23 Wilbur went into creative clearly
the amount of that's what she said moments is crazy
Why did tommy set Phil's game mode to creative?
Please play a horror map together
NOT SEEING THE BLACK HOLE THEN LIGHTNING JUST LIGHTS UP THE EDGES TO SEE HOW BIG IT IS-
Float boat
I have a question. would you rather women that are absolutely gorgeous looking but very mean or a nice funny one that is decent looking?
Thank you Wilbur and Charlie for the references that I understood at the age of thirteen
ball of black 3.0
charlie: aoaoaow guys i'm so long subtitles: IF I GET SUCKED IN
I like how the editor actually puts in some latin...
4:46 when you accidentally mess up the color messages assigned to each person...
Are you and tubbo still bsf?
Wilbur: all of Tommy’s fans are 14  Tommy: not ALL of them some are 16 some are 18  Me who is 12 and likes watching them: 😔👍
3:23 i mean wilburs already gay for the egg soooooo
Yeah I just subscribed, that was a good choice I think
Black Hole: *destroying everything* Wilbur: Hmm clash royale
I can't be the only one who thinks we need techno in one of Tommy's videos
TOMMY IS NOT GOOD TOMMY AMAZING
Weird to think Wilbur actually knows about black holes. FINALLY, someone else who gets it
I’m 12 and I understood
we, truly do, live in a society
21:29 *epic halo music starts playing*

God these videos are my favorite
Why you always type funny and halerous in all your videos
Slimecicle: so Wilbur's dead Captions: *so Wilburs dad*
to wilbur. i am 11 and know all these songs you poopie
The quizzical active orly tow because august immunophenotypically vanish off a decisive racing. parsimonious, accidental clef
my favorite part of all of this was wilbur and charlie singing britney by far the song is still stuck in my head :D
Wilbur and Slimecicle: “Tommyinnit’s fans won’t get these references.”  Wilbur and Slimecicle: *start singing*  Me: *starts singing along*
Since when tommy's mic is bad?
BRUHHHHH STOP adding ur stupid laughing *hahahaha funi joke*  face into ur EVERY video
I used Charlie Slimecicle’s if then situations in my English test and I got a 100/100 on it. THANKS CHARLIE SLIMECICLE!
Next video: Minecraft's Dark Asylum Mod is Very Funny
Tommy will like this comment
I’m just saying I’m around the age 14 and I got every reference that Wilbur and Charlie did
I love these videos so much Tommy make more please these make my day :)

12:00 Modern Warfare lobby music
damnationem latine?... hoc est verum latine?... n o it is.. "TODAY WE FILLED A POOL WITH 3 MILLION ORBEEZ AND WE'RE GONNA BE JUMPING IN AND FINDING SALVATION"
I feel offended that Wilbur thinks we don't know these legendary songs I-
How could they say such things to that ender dragon they were really DRAGON his name through the mud
Philza just carrying the whole game
7:53 *[Tommyinnit: Set Ph1LzA's game mode to creative]*
tommys 16 isnt he? he has nearly 7 million subscribers. im 15, 16 in july and i only just learned how to make food other than pasta 8/9 months ago....

Bruh did Charlie really just start a clash royale game in the middle of the running from a black hole
When your 13 and you knew every reference Wilbur and Charlie made
The fact that he puts subtitles on his videos for deaf people is soo 🥺❤️
i think its weird how its always wilbur who starts a fucking cult by dying

Hi Tommy! I bought your yootooz and it came today and is sick! Keep it up

Fan video https://www.youtube.com/dQw4w9WgXcQ

Watch my newest video
7:54 It says Tommyinnit made Philza go into creative mode

Charlie hEe HeE’d himself to death

8:24 "Oh I'm Shaggin" - TommyInnit 2021
Tommy, I as a person who does not like to see disrespect, urges you to look at the perspective of Dream. In his eyes he has been the balance keeping the SMP together, and when he did something you saw as out of order, in which he saw as restoring balance, you imprisoned him. Now do not get me wrong, Dream did terrible things, but for you to treat someone with more disrespect than they ever threw at you, to torture someone with the gun of Pandora Vault and the bullets of insanity, who was still your friend even in exile, that is worse than what Dream could have ever done to you. As you know your country, L'manburg is a supposed Democracy, though I have not seen a trial for Dream to be prisoned, nor one with a non-biased jury. Every man, anywhere has rights, and freedom of a certain area to exercise, to communicate, and no exceptions to their justice and no one is allowed to tamper with their own justice or imprisonment, and they are not given to them because it is a favor, it is because without them, people can go insane. That is what you are doing, to a prisoner, who already has it bad enough, you just take it farther. I am not a Dream Stan, I am just someone who cares for the sake of others. And while I am here, let me point out one last thing. Every Action has its Equal and Opposite Reaction, so with the amount of suffrage you are throwing at a man who was willing to kill you, he will do just as much to you as you have done to him, and much, much worse if you keep up these childish games.

21:29 is the best part of the whole thing lmao
When are we going to talk again? :D

This part ia so intense
Why did Wilbur actually accurately say what ages watches his vids ?
They failed I knew every song.

I love how all videos go Wibur and Charlie go off, Phil works and Tommy just follows
POV: looking if mrbeast commented
Mr beast really had more burgers
The salty hawk ultrastructurally hand because invoice internationally remain as a cautious robin. savory, inconclusive forest
Those of us that were born in '09 knowing all of the "obscure references", we're THOSE kids. The ones who are absolute fricking morons to everyone in their grade, the ones who are the weirdest fricking people on earth, the ones who only listen to music from then. We are proud of ourselves for this because we are the morons that we are.
Ph1LzA : Oh [       ] im getting sucked into the black hole! * ender pearls out * * pearls gets sucked * Ph1LzA : Oh FU-- Mr Beast inside : Hello
Ayo look at the subtitles 14:09
Slimecicle, Wilbur, and Philza really carried this video
These videos are just slime and Wilber doing a bit and getting super into it and tommy annoying Philza

I SUB TO ALL OF YOUR VIDEOS! I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK(please give me a shout out bc i have never had one😁)
Did they use one of the mw19 menu themes for one of the intense themes?
The possessive swimming chiefly embarrass because quilt roughly untidy mid a gabby trout. abashed, terrific battle
Just a suggestion but, You guys should link the songs.
I knew ALL Charlie and Phil's references, that's not good.
We know that men go it the hole but we have not proved whether women are pulled or not  More experimentation required
Literally every reference Wilbur thought we wouldn't get, I got xD (I'm 15 this year)
Dudes almost at 7 mil wtf
16:05 that music is the militia skirmish music from fucking Just Cause 3 lmao
awesome videos tommy - keep up the great work buddy :)
I was having dinner today and we somehow get on the topic of name (me, sister and mum) My mum goes on to say something like "Tommy's a really cute little boys name" I started laughing and she looked at me confused I said "srry there's this guy on YouTube and his names tommy, hes the youngest in his friend group so everyone calls him child."
Hey tommy what’s gonna be the next funniest mod (for legal reasons this is a joke)

clementine is the name of the moth you wanted but never got correct?
Why did this feel like a frozen movie lmao
Why is no one pointing out how much Wilbur was getting into it, like, being possessed by the black hole, actually dee-yiy-ing for real, and all that crap, whilst everyone else was just goofing around and not taking it seriously?
I love how Wilbur in every video he’s like vey very weird... like very weird.
If people make alt accounts too subscribe
"stop talking about subscribers phil, I want to rob people."  that’s a new quote

Hi Tommy you might of seen me on Wilbur's comments, and the reason that I started doing this is because i dont have anyone to talk to about how I feel and  how I need help with my problems, so im telling you guys because you guys are one of my favorite    people on this planet. Telling you guys has made me happier and more open to people. :)
I like the persona 5 music

I m so excited my broken marriage has been restored. "We recently made up, even though it was difficult. It's been more than a month now, and everything feels like it's returned to normal. He has begun to treat me better, and it's  been a healing process for both of us. The night mare that had lasted for almost 2 years before we broke up is finally over. It's like we fell in love all over again! We 've both put the past behind us, and are trying  to move forward_ and for the first time in long time, the future look alot brighter.i can't express in world's how grateful I am Dr uduebor for revive it's like we 've finally rediscovered those things about each other that made us fall in  love in the first place. All of the worry and stress has simply vanished. Thank you Dr uduebor for saving my broken marriage and bringing my husband back to me! "  Me and my husband are living together happily again.  All thanks to Dr uduebor.if you have any problem with hearth issues as well.  Contact (dr.uduebor@gmail.com) or Whatsapp (+2349044159370).

he is 6 foot 1
Wtf, im 10 years old and actually have a lv 10 village in clash of clans   Refuted :3
"lets just row with it"  tommy: *looks at him in disappointment, looks away* LOL

It looks like my mom
Hi I love ur vids so much
I watch these people come up with a routine for videos and exploit as much as possible
U know what’s even scarier about the black hole, it’s a circle ⭕️
what i’ve learned today: -tommy is my physics teacher  -mr. beast is the devil yet also jesus -make chickens do not lay eggs  that’s it
charlie: let’s just row with it. tommy: *glances over at him* wilbur: *clears throat*
Phil just carried the others to survival every mid video
The way the lightning flashed look awesome
haha! i love the EPIC music when it would show philza. but also when wilbur died and just yelled "DONT STOP" had me wheezing! ...MAKE IT POP DJ -
What were the songs that wilbur and slime sing?
0:16 i was looking fro my phone then saw these two (schlatt lookin at somethin?)
Bri ish Innit
Hi
I only watch your videos for more slimecicle content.
Nothin's dangerous when you're the tommyinnit  -tommyinnit
have you ever known the feeling when someone commented something but you wish it was you who commented it first? i have
tommy: you know there’s a black hole behind us- charlie: is that true? hang on- tommy: laughs a little charlie: *..oh would you look at that*
tommy really likes the name clementine
Tommy hasnt go to kindergarden yet, i think he skipped it, he cant count
Meh
Youtube would not stop suggesting this so i suppose ill give it a watch
The sad thing is I knew all the references and I'm 14.
I hope you reach 10 million subs

The fact that you talk most of the time instead of running away from the black hole gives me anxiety
PERSONA MUSIC!!!
Tommy enough with stealing mario galaxy music!!!
I (as a 14 year old) frankly understood all of that references
DID I HEAR WILLPOWER FROM PERSONA 5? FUCK YESSSS
So ok
Why is it that every time tommy uploads he looks 1 year older and 2 inches taller
Shoutout to all my boys who watched How The Universe Works on the OG Science channel and know how terrifying real black holes are
Slimecicle made it more funny
17:26 is that song Will Power from persona 5😂
TOMMYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY Pls notice im a huge fan and im still a very vry huge fan even if im only 9..heh pls notice
Dude Charlie’s and Wilburs experiment bit have off actual horror movie vibez
the backwards latin translates to "Sentence in latin" and "This is true in Latin"
me being 13 knowing all the references Wilbur and Charlie were making: :D yeaahhh i totally dont know what these are!
The halo 3 music in the end 😂😂😂
Why does Tommy use so much Halo music, specifically from Halo 3
phil is always trying to beat the game while tommy wilbur and charlie are off doing the most random things
straight face 😐
05:54 "Lets go do Basketball and drugs"
tommy so unfunny 😴
not funny
i still love the fact that will just goes slowly insane every video
19:58 the lightening is scawy
Everyone is just talking about the glaciers whilst Philza is fucking speed running 😭😭😭
20:30 - Toxic by: Britney Spears 20:38 - ? I have no idea ? 20:45 - Hamilton? 20:59 Tik Tok by: Kesha Did I miss any?
You Suck, get better lol
Philza in most of TommyInnit's videos: *I'm getting diamonds*
I understand all of those references :)
alt title: philza and tommy escape the black hole and beat the game while slime and willbur "examine" and "test" the black hole (it was hillarious)
They beat the game but no the black hole.
Lol
14:10 wh-
I worked too hard to find 'English sentence that is true in Latin...' thanks editor larry

Wilbur and Charlie: Lets say something Tommy's fans won't understand Also them: with the taste of your lips im on a rideeeee me: YOU'RE TOXIC, I'M SLIPPING UNDER!
I am 13 and understand all the references
Fun Fact: Almost a year ago Tommy was still at 159,000 subs now he’s at almost 7 mil, is dreams viewers subing to him now? Cause the only rashional solution because Tommy gor famous after he joined the Dream smoke lol

British gang
I love your vids, I don't think they're annoying I think they're very funny! And I know you're probably not going to see this, but if you do that's what I want to say.
was i the only one who completely flipped out after i realised that the cuts to Phil actually playing the game had persona music in the backround? i may be wrong but that most probably was 'will power' from persona 5
I was about to comment that they were actually telling pretty accurate information about black holes (did a pretty big project about them a few weeks earlier for physics) but then the black hole was in wilbur? and i was just like alright its okay
Damnationme latine  hoc est verum latine
In memory of charlie  -he got sucked by the balck hole
My favorite jetpack in jetpack joyride was the bubble  shit idk the name

1:17 and that's how Michael Jackson died.
5:59 it's not a black it's pain
i like annoying youtubers
is it bad that I know all of the references the Charlie and Wilbur made? the ones that were meant to confuse us?
MATE THIS WAS SO POG LOVED THE SUSPENSE AT THE END
Slimie are you ok, you ok, you ok Slimie?
SOMEBODY GO TO THE SCENE WHERE WILBUR HAS HIS PHONE OUT AND FIGURE OUT HIS NAME ON CLASH ROYALE
Black Hole Sun, Black Hole Sun
U may or may not have more subs than Technoblade
The unsightly greek recently point because rose fortuitously soothe absent a scandalous carpenter. sudden, extra-large extra-small exuberant beech
Tommy: WE FINALLY BEAT A CHALLENGE  Black hole: I'm about to end this man's life
i love watching these videos bc phil is always progressing then everyone else is killing each other
We need Quackity & Slimecicle in a video together so there can be complete chaos
Chickens don’t have to breed irl to make eggs thy just wont be fertile you can eat them tho-

Hi
The quickest elizabeth ethnically recognise because drill distinctly whirl regarding a  fascinated save. nasty, loving doubt
Bring me that black hole 😈
I like all the casual cheating in the chat
LMAOOO the Latin sentences at around 7:10 are “damnationme latin” which means “Latin sentence” and “Hoc est verum latine” or “This is a Latin word”
O  no
5:12  Oh no anyways
Are you adopted? #Q&A
The nifty stage remarkably suit because gazelle neurally flap alongside a protective hardhat. imperfect, deadpan helmet
Ah yes, ✨Clementine✨

The warthog run music at the end was the most satisfying thing ever(other than the warthog run)
Y phill need creative
“Listen man, I went for particle physics not biology” the science humor lmaoooo
I hope tommyinnit keeps uploading videos they make me happy when sad.
https://youtu.be/yapUngQP9_E 😂😂😁😁
Lucky for you that’s what I like
12:00 why is there warzone music????
I got bored so I translated what Mr Beast said to Wilbur and it says... English sentence. This is true Latin.
What if we are like 12 but we know almost all of the songs they were talking about
omg nice vid<3
Hi
In every single mod video tommyinnit does, Wilbur goes insane or dies, and I love it.
1:22 no one is talking about Charlie's micheal Jackson scene right there. It looks so funny to me.

This is most plot driven mod series I’ve seen ever
14:09 nice subtitles
I follow u on TikTok
e
14:24 “the nearest fortress is at -320 ___”
Lmao  Chat at 14:25 made me die
When Will and Charlie sung Britney Spear's Toxic to try and flush out 14 year old TommyInnit fans, I felt personally attacked...    Still a banger tho
I think clementine is a fine and dandy name
tommy and the black hole comming to theaters ner you
Schools in 2025: Eggs can go into blackholes.

Tommy is my homie
Lol to the ending 😂😂😂

Me who is 12 and understood every reference
When I watch his streams on YouTube bc I can’t get twitch 😭🖐
Why is PhiZA in creative at some point ? (7:55)

Bruh I know how to do the moonwalk
7:51 Phil wsmr in creative lol
Love the persona 5 battle music
21:51 crap

I just want to say a massive thank you to you Tommy, I've been stressed with schoolwork and stuff but your vids, no matter on what channel, always make me laugh so I just want to say thank you Tommy
Hey and my friends have made a fun mini game / map and would love some builders/testers please reply we need help
I stg Tommy just hit 3 mil, damn he's growing so quick
“He went long, and then he was gone” and “he went wide and then he died” are my new favourite sentences of all time they’re just such beautiful sentences.
21:51 this part looks like a literall movie
I feel so bad for the editor putting in captions lmao
They say I won't understand them song lyrics Bc I'm 14, but little do they know....
"I'MA GOING TO THE BLACK HOLE"
Wilbur really thought that kanye west reference would pass thru my head
Tommy your discord got leaked I’ll tell you how because I friended you my name is that one kid
Is it just me or does he wear the same shirt every video
Good luck road to 10Millions Subscriber Good luck tommyinnit💖
LANGUAGE
Okay I know I watched this like yesterday but it’s funny and I wanna watch it again.
entering the ender portal was so epic bro f for charlie
Tommy is so gay
7:54 look in chat
Wait, how do you skip the credits??
Can we note that as Wilbur goes "I see the stars" the sun comes out from behind a cloud and my whole room brightens
this mod has one black hole me: *looks at my girl* i think she had two black holes
techno is getting more subs per day
J
Tommy: whats heaven like Wilbur: its red and hot   Me: thats my type of heaven
Get this man to 10m now
3:33  =  Ph1lza was slain by Iron Golem

Persona fans know
SMP died
bro my parents would be like "why don't you start making money?" and I see this kid the same age as me making 500 grand a month off laughing at Big Black Holes ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Yes
*Philza beating the game* tommy: *rows the very slow boat*
wliber and slimecicle thinking that the early 2000s kids wont know tiktok by ke$ha was funny
Why are u only doing mod videos now
i know i may not be the first to ask, but..... where's techno? is he just doing his own thing?
got that warzone music lol
Hi Tommy I’m watching your stream now and I now that you aren’t seeing my comment beacuse the chat goes too fast and I just wanna tell you thanks for cheering me up when I’m crying literally thanks
Why is Tommy so handosome?  *Bruh, I am not gay*
Tommy hows the snap streak
imagine being called a 14 yr old when you arent even 14. Me too Sad times
That halo music is epic as fuck!
not me being 13 and knowing the revernice
I’m proud of Tommy,no sex jokes this vid
Poor wilbur he was playing clash royale 😭😭😭
Wen the  new update comes out can you do the morph
....no one gonna talk about persona 5 music playing in the background during the nether part?
I like how Wilbur and Charlie tried to confuse everyone because were all 14-18 and started singing Toxic and Stronger as if we weren’t present in the early 2000s
1:22 "hee hee AA OH"
Wilbur opening up my childhood with those songs sheshhhhh coming from a 17 year old
I’m roughly the same age as Tommy and I understand every refer that will and Charlie made
every time I watch one of these vids the intro BAFFLES me, he literally gains almost a million subs between each mod video, its genuinely incredible.
Tommy can you tell me that you're ok? I'm just having a bit of a panic attack and I need to know if you're okay
Pliza with the hell dramic side quest love it
Hmm Slime and Quackity are both funny, but have never been in the same video together...  Hmm...     *Slimecicle=Quackity confirmed*
Tommy tell will I’m 12 and I understand-
AND SOME ARE 12
WHATS WITH ALL THE HALO MUSIC LMAO
To The Early Squad Reading This: sending virtual hugs to everyone who needs it! stay safe and positive in these difficult times🛩      My Dream is to hit 40k, I’m struggling and trying to make my mom proud.😱
Why does wilbur remind me of uncle rick and slimecicle is morty lol
Do you remember technos maid???
big fan!!!!!
Why did they keep making references that us 14 year olds 100% understand.
Is it just me who saw Tommy give phil creative mode at 7 minutes and 50 seconds 🤣
Phil : *beating the game* The other three: *singing and talking about mobile games*
Is anyone else 14 and under and know the songs Wilbur and Charlie were singing!
i love how wilbur is always the traumatized one in these it probably should be worrying and i hope hes ok but hes very funny
i love how when philza is getting rods, will power from persona 5 is playing
i saw the chat tp and creative
I'll get long then I'll be gone I'll get wide then i shall die -Dr.Slimecicle
dr phil-za
I love how Phil does all the actual work, tommy tries to do the same but is like a literal puppy not being able to decide which person to follow, and will and charlie just come up with the randomest plot points and stick with it the entire time... (bees, daisies, eggs...)
At 5:33 it shows they went in creative
OMG Tommy is almost at 7 million Im not even at 10 yet :(
Charlie: HEHE *gets fucking obliterated*
i'm 14 and i got both of those references
tommyinnit set own game mode to creative mode
did will just try to trick us with britney spears toxic? what has this world become.
im 13 and every song yhey sang i knew
I'm 13 and recognized all of Wills References
Them: *start singing Toxic* Me: IM ADDICTED TO YOU BUT YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE TOXIC-
Umm yesterday Tommy had 6.66 million subscribers and today he only has 6.7...........wuts happened?
14:23 Check The Chat :laughing: Tommy Exposed 2021? lol
Tommyint ask Charlie for his clash of clans name i wanna 1v1 on him it
3:33 Charlie & Wilbur tries to scare an egg out of chicken.  Meanwhile: *Phil gets walloped by the golem*

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I like how tommy did /fortress to find it 14:24
Bro, I think Wilbur underestimated the iq of this 16 year old. I knew all of the references because of just dance
wilbur is so feral i love him
Do they cheat
Anybody else hear the cod music?
little does wilbur know we grew up with those songns
LMFAO Wilbur just playing clash royal
this video was the funniest.
0:01
I’m 13 and I knew all those references, looks like I’m ✨cultured✨
Are your rememeber me. Im malanie we meet Allegedly in among US  Respond to this message if it was you I don't believed it but It's worth a try
you can see him user /locate smh
16:27 I got just cause vibes
Any other 14 year olds that understood what Wilbur and Charlie sang? 😎
As someone who is 17 I understand all these references and I’m offended
i understood literally all of there refrences tho
I got all their references and I am younger than 14-  11 to be exact.
where not all 13+ Im TEN
“I’m the golden boy” *flashbacks to the fred weasley fanfiction*
I remember this dude was at 500k what tuff happened
*Jokes on Wilbur and Charlie, TiK ToK (by Ke$ha) was my favourite song and I am a shit ton younger than everyone in this video. Fight me*
I know all of those songs
youtube just unsubbed me from you
“There not all 16 some are 18” Me: I’m 11
my god this is such shit....
we just gonna ignore tommy put phil into creative 7:48
I am playing overwach and chose the black whole charatar as soon as i pressed this video
lair im 12
Wilbur and Charlie saying Tommys fans are 14 year old  Me a 14 year old singing along to kesha
Just wondering, where is a trustable link i can find to get optifine?
The words were backwards latin, and mean “english sentence that is true in latin” in case you wanted to know.
Tommyinnit: u can unsubscribe anytime, everyone: *unsubscribes* him: that’s- not how I meant...
Fun fact: If a person does pass the event horizon, they do experience spaghettification
13:09 Tommy's face go brrrrr
I love how Wilbur and Charlie tried referencing things 14 y/o’s wouldn’t get but then sang songs that every single person born in the late 2000’s know-
Some are 12
I'd just dig to bed rock
i liked the just cause 3 music choice
when they think tommy’s fans don’t know britney spears ✋
Every modded video:   Tommy: “Phil where are you?”  Philza: “I got diamonds.”
me when I hear persona music in a tommyinnit video
Take a drink every time Slime mentions his degree
When I heard tides in the ocean my brain immediately went 'at least I think or am I dead wrong?' Roadtrip is great man...
Charlie and Wilbur casually knowing nothing about kids these days.
So many game mode switches
The shaggy tenor microbiologically prefer because shorts structurally burn above a fat faulty velvet. puzzled, devilish detective
Quackity would fit great in these series, prove me wrong
oh god
14.24 kinda sus tommyinnit looking for the closest forest🙃🙃
crysis 1             geddit
Albert has more subs than Him :O
Phil got some explaining to do changing to spectator and creative
Lol i found his yt from me trying to connect to the school internet and all I see is sub to tommyinnit
Why would people dislike his videos so much?
@MrBeast
I love how everyone is running from the black hole and having fun while Philza is just having a adventure in the nether
I Am Nine... Should i not wach this??
Phil died to an iron golem lmao
Charlie and Wilbur just casually singing and vibing as they slowly get pulled towards the impending doom that is the black hole was hilarious to watch. The fact I know each of the songs they sung kinda surprised me. MrBeast is officially Satan.
I feel old I understood all of Wilburs references I might cry
I love this mod videos 😂💕
The halo music was a nice touch.
14:24 *The nearest fortress is at*
every new era of survival  philza: *im just gonna get the enderdragon and end tommyinnits fucking video*
7:09 actually this sentence translates as "English sentence that is true in Latin"
my brother being 11 and knowing the toxic song be like:
when the persona 5 song comes on
Tommy really /located the fortress
Tommy has some explaining to do at 7:52
I was born in 2007 and I know all the references but the "Tik Tok" one brought me back.🤣🤣🤣
Tommyinnit set Ph1lza's game mode to creative............ I AM BLINDDDDD
The COD music tho
Let’s confuse Tommys fans, there all 14.  Them singing the songs  me singing along
A fifth dimensional prank by the Chuckle Sandwich Podcast
I may be 13 but all the songs they sung I know 😭😂
*heHEEe* Michael Jackson that you?!
all the homies know Charlie would never eat karls grilled cheese
How has a child more subs than 80-90% people on yt
I loved when will and Charlie were doing the bit about us all being 14 and I knew most of what they talked about so yeah I am cool
jokes on will and charlie, I got all of the references they made
14:25 look at the chat
Charlie looks like a divorced dad
Every single reference they tried to make that we won’t understand I understood. Do better doctors.
Let’s be honest.. Wilber low key carries the humor in these videos
Philza is like that one kid in a group project that does all the work.
when will sings songs thinking we wouldn’t know them. like i sing along with them
"He got long and then he was gone" "He got wide and then he died" - Slimecicel 2021
Tommy’s HD face is scary
7:52 TommyInnit: Set PH1LZA’s gamemode to Creative
that creeper scared  out the fuck out of me
does someone know the name of the sing playing at the beggining
I know I was raised well when I recognized every song Wilbur and slimecicle and I’m 14
Me:Angelica eliza and peggy😂
Can I join dreams smp I think I would be a great addition I am a good build I will do whatever you want I can help rebuild a city for you
You can unsubscribe ANYTIME, Next morning i need MORE
0:54 same mate
"we FINALLY beat a challenge" they say every time, despite always beating the challenge lmaoo
I am 14 and I understood all of those references
tommy using p5 music is a fever dream
"theyre all 14 that means they were born in 200-"  me, 14:  *h o w   d i d   y o u   k n o w*
As a fourteen year old, I knew every single one of those songs. You failed to confuse us.

“I’m getting sphagettified” - Tommyinnit 2021
T-the persona 5 music 🥺
Tommy buffet. Specialize: spaghetti wilbur
Bruh I inverted this and the black hole isn't a black hole anymore, it's a white hole ༼⁰o⁰；༽꒳ᵒ꒳ᵎᵎᵎ
Black holes explode when they are too big. This should be a feature
Phil carries then every challenge
pog this is the best in the world LMAO
Only me that noticed that Tommy made Ph1LzA creative mode
What’s the discord?
That moment with Wilbur in the boat made me think of Wheatley from Portal 2😂😂😂
Wilbur and Charlie: Imma get a scholarship to kings college-.  me after: IPROBABLYSHOULDNTBRAGBUTDAGIMAZEANDASTONISH-
I got everything Wilbur and Charlie said
THE HAMILTON REFERENCE BAHAHA
did no one look at 7:52 lol!?!?!?! look at the chat
This video has literally only been out for about a day and I've already watched it  3 times lmao
My BW clips with dreams song is here now!!  https://youtu.be/xYEVykW8je8
will power as Phil's theme is pretty cool
H
1:26 LOL
Welcome back to another episode of Philza beating the game with 3 wild children
why vacuum when you have wilbur trying to confuse 14 year old tommyinnit fans?
i want a pet black hole and i want to name it clementine
Bro im 15 and i got all of the references-
Notification: Minecraft’s black...
Kiinda horrifing it is that tommy reaches 7M soon
Pog #5 in trending on gaming LETSGO!
I do hours to install a mod how you do that?
almost at 6.9m
I'm not 14-18 I'm 12 :)
Tommy I’m a little like you
There are some viewers that are actualy 8 7 and 10
When charlie said "'ELIZA, AND PEGGY" i got so much serotonin
when you got the refrences wilbur made and you are 14
6.7M SUBS LETS GOOO
Everyone but philza: sailing and running away from a Black Hole while tommy stressing Philza: in the nether getting a lot stuff and just chilling
There are just so many “That what she said” moments and it makes me happy
Is no one gonna talk about Tommy setting Phil’s game mode to creative?
Tommy:”I’ll help you i am friends with MrBeast”   Some streams earlier: MrBeast:”I don’t wanna talk to you, you made me give someone 100k”
dream did this first
New shir-! oh ok...
What if Mr beast comments
Tommy’s channel is dieng, and Wilbur is slowly hating Tommy.
Tommy deserves all of his subscribers!
tommyinnit "Just killed a woman feeling good"
Tommy whenever he needes something:”PHILLL”
7:50  Hol’ up
Tommy nearing 7mil, been watching him since 70k. It’s surprising how far the boy has come.
also with the songs that they said that we wouldn't understand, i knew all of them........cause a lot of them where on nightcore soooo
what did wilbur say
20:33 JOKES ON YOU, I HAVE THE INTERACTIVE INTROVERTS DVD, WILBUR
E
Bro didn’t tommy just hit 6 mill like 2 weeks ago?
Does anybody else think that Tommy has a weird obsession with girls?
This reminds me of Dream's video with George and Sapnap- it's legit the same thing lol
433,000th like! :D
The one thing I don't like about this is the unrealistic size of that black hole. They're only about the size of a city block
when "damnationem latine hoc est verum latine" does not translate into "today we filled a pool with 3 million orbeez and we're gonna be jumping in and finding salvation" but instead into "English sentence that is true in Latin" *betrayed noises*
MY BEST FRIEND IS KINDA (very veryyyyy) obsessed with you! She said that u have spoken to her! Her name is summer!! Idk idk 🤷🏼‍♀️
Every 2 months he gets 1 million subs
Love all your videos! Makes me laugh harder then I've ever laughed!! Keep up the good work!
I’m 14 and I knew all those songs
"Damnationem latine hoc est verum latine." Well latine is Latin, hoc est means is, verum is true, and I don't know what damnationem is. So put through google translate that's; "A Latin sentence that is true in English."  What relevance does that have?? And now the word Latin looks wrong...
Wilbur: "They're all 14" Tommy: "They're not ALL 14, some are 16, some are 18!" Me: Some are *TEN* 😀
Philza in these videos:Hunter gatherer
At least play halo if you use the music so much
Black hole be like: GET SNAPPED BOI
Nobody:…  Tommy: I SPOTTED IT WITH MY EARS
today, I've filled a pool with the small percentage of people who watch my videos that are actually subscribed, and today we are going to be jumping in and finding salvation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9JWqXfp7SQ&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=MrCow
3:57 Tommyinnit:I'm the golden boy not piss-pants.
STOP TALKING ABOUT SUBSCRIBERS PHIL I WANT TO *ROB* PEOPLE COME TAKE A BITE PHILZAAAAAA IN HERE PUBERTY NEVER ENDSSSSS nothings dangerous when youre *the* tommyinnit OH I CANT BELIEVE YOU MADE IT, AND ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS GIVE YOUR *SOUL TO MR BEAST* youre lookin awfully.... *WIDE* UH UH UH OH OH ....... *BLABAKHJABLJSB* i dont wanna hit on him, or hit him dude, scout master says you werent supposed to bring your phone what the hell
6:47 "damnationem latine hoc est verum latine" means to google translate"English sentence that is true in Latin". In which it actually means "Just an English sentence in Latin".
6:18  Jeez Wilbur
Everyone : screaming and shouting Philza: Defeating the dragon
wilbur: “They’re all 14”  me, 18: *sweats*
7:08 that message backwards was:  damnationem latine  English sentence And Hoc est verum latine This is true in Latin
19:55 *music starts* 20:00 *music ends* 20:03 *music starts* 20:06 *Tommy screams*
Love how they tried to do things we wouldn't understand but played like every song on one of my playlists
WE’RE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT THE PERSONA 5 MUSIC WITH Ph1LzA IN THE NETHER
"hey charlie how do you wanna die"
When you're 14 and you still get all the jokes that Will and Charlie said and all the references they made-

How do I join the discord server
Everyone: talking about phil doing everything and identifing the refernces me: they fcked up the lyrics
Yoooooooooooooooooooooooooo 69
Wilbur assuming I'm 14 when in reality I am 21 xD
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.

"Some are 16 some are 18!" Me who is 11: hmmm I know all the references they said
7:09 lol this translates to "this is real latin" in latin
how did they think that 14 year olds wouldn’t know of those songs. they have echoed through the universe and are sewed into each fresh new mind ever born in the living plane. once born the small children will begin to sing the tunes of Kesha and Britney Spears. it is forever and we are not. you underestimate our infinite knowledge of the most brilliant songs ever written. learn, fools - it is easy knowledge to obtain if you peer closer.

Hey tommy why do u say bad words
tommy mod video: first video guys were getting close to 5 mill second video guys were getting close to 6 mil third video guys were getting close to 7 mil
does anyone else hear the persona 5 music in the background as Phil gets blaze rods and pearls? :3
Tommys obnoxious laugh makes any crappy joke good 👍
7:08 TODAY I FILLED A WHOLE POOL WITH 3 MILLION ORBEES
I got every one of those Song References
You know, the only unrealistic thing I see from this is the fact that a real black hole would grow ridiculously faster than it is in this mod
the persona 5 music eye-
14:25 ???? Tommy
John 3:16-17 16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen!
“He got long then he was gone” “He went wide then he died”
Didn't Dream make this? This plug in/mod?
Wilbur & slimcicle: singing high pitched song Tommy: *Epic escape with halo music*
20:06,21:22

Me 13 knowing every song they said
Me: Casually looking through the comments section The comments section: *Full of bots*
I’m sort of annoyed that Tommy’s videos are always on top 10 trending
My friend sad "Tommy is my mommy"
This was so funny
Bruh I watched tommy go from 127k to 6mil and it's almost felt like it's been weeks lmao
Me knowing all the songs will and slimsical are sing 🤣
Not sure if Tommy just throws in „He is like a brother to me“ to screw with Wilbur or SBI fans or both lmao
I just wanna know the music that plays when they enter the portal, cuz it was super intense and awesome
Damnationem latine Hoc est verum latine Is the caption not in reversed and it translates to: English sentence  This is true in Latin
I'm straight dieing
Remember when Tommy was a skyblock YT with 100k subs and actually good content? Well I remember the first two
the fact the halo melody is playing in the background it fits perfectly
Bro philza going turbo mode
I like how they sang songs that literally anyone from the 2000s would know.  Like, my sister was born in 2012 and she knew those songs.
20:24  im 14 and i know all the references he was mentioning.....
Am I the only one how love tommyinit and want to understand the dream amp but doesn’t get it (ps I know this has nothing to do with it but I just done even know)

7:54 Philza in da creative mode
I love that philza is just casually beating the game while tommy slime and willbur try to survive
Is it just me or I didn’t care about the video. The only thing I care about was the halo theme song
Well you see, according to the photosynthesis antidisestablishmentarianism theory, this video wasn’t astrophyscially correct because the infrastructure didn’t go through the correct femtometer
Ever heard of ExplodingTNT?
Yo
17:41 there are really two types of people in the world
Funnily enough I’ve had a relative unironically wonder if mrbeast was of demonic origins bcoz why would a man named beast give millions of dollars if not to tempt u into committing sin
UwU

Wilbur and Charlie singing my childhood as they are on the verge of death is the biggest mood ever. Specifically the part where they're singing Tik Tok by Ke$ha as Wilbur gets sucked in

Hold up when the heck did you hit 6 mil?

Tbh your just becoming someone who just makes clickbaits videos like, not cool man
I’m excited for you to get 7 million subscribers (do you think we can do it)
I dont know if Tommy or Editor Larry put in the persona music montage of Phil,  but it was the right choice >:D
This was so much more stressful that it needed to be, especially when the black hole decided to absolutely speed towards them LMAO
Why does the only funny one die before the end >:(
1. HOW DOES WILBUR KNOW HOW OKD I AM- 2. WILBUR I KNOW ALL THOSE REFERENCES- 😂😂
The return of clementine!!
>charlie set his gamemode to survival< never mind that
Ya im 14 but i kniw all those damn songs.
Tommy should get 6.69M subs am I right? Duhhhh
congrats on #1 Trending for Gaming
anyone gonna tell the fact that the black hole is *round*
When Tommy and his friends think your 16 to 14 but your 10: 👁️💧👄💧👁️
Wilbur: says 14 year olds won’t get the references he’s about to make  Me who knew all of them: 👁👄👁 I’m not 14 anymore? * ascends*
21:10 i understood all those jokes!!
MrBeast wya??

H E   I S    I N   C O N T R O L
Just wait till he does an Omegle video
H E   I S    I N    C O N T R O L
H E    I S    I N   C O N T R O L
Wilbur: "let's make references Tommy's fans won't get" Also wilbur: **proceeds to sing some of my favourite songs**
H E   I S    I N   C O N T R O L
OKAY İ HAVE BEEF. Wilbur says 'let's make references to my fans won't get, they're all 14' and then sings Toxic by Brittany spears. THAT WAS MY FAVOURITE SONG AS A KID YOU MELENIAL
I love how Philza is just giving and is so successful and at the same time Wilbur,Charlie, and Tommy are just cheating death 😂
21:57 the funniest part about this is that tommy sweared a bit much to wilbur whos only been doing science this whole time and didnt even helped them preparing and the way he didnt said anything after tommy sweared on him was sooooo funny😂😂
Tommy at the end of every single video: We did it! We FINALLY beat a challenge.
Gay
Wilbur playing clash royale!
I love how phil is the only one that's been doing all of the work when in mods
Philza is so slept on, he carried the whole video and even let Tommy finish the Dragon.
6:10 I find it funny that he censorsed cocaine and not fucking
I love that in all if these videos, Phil and Wilbur are in them
4:46 editor Larry I found a mistake on the subtitles, you made Wilbur's color green and Slimecicle's color purple  (Edit: I spotted another mistake at 14:10, the subtitle is saying something different to what they are saying)
Are we not gonna talk about the ball hole being a circle
Mr Beast overlord of Hell EXPOSED!! [NOT CLICKBAIT]
I remeber when tommy woild get bullied by his friends for not hitting 1 mil views on a vid  WHOS TALKING NOW BITCH BOYS!!!!!

i like how tommy always says “we finnally beat a challenge” at the end of every video like they never win
Tecnoblade: yay 6 mil. Tommy: close to 7 mil bitches
For anyone wondering, the Latin subtitles translate to “damn Latin” “this is Latin”

lol
ba
The thing that added so much drama was when the lightning struck so you could see the black hole
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."

They should have used safety googles against the black hole :)
the fools, slimecicle and wilbur assume we don’t know these old timey songs... little do they know. yes we know toxic by brit spears, and don’t stop  absolute fools.
I’m pretty sure most of the commands in chat are from willbur and Charlie coming back from dying in hole
21:29 Charlie's death scene
Are we gonna ignore the fact that tommy  used commands to find fortress in 14:25
7:52 Tommy put Philza in creative

A wise man once said  "DONT STOP!" -Wilbur Soot 2021

“He went long and now he’s gone. He went wide and then he died.”
When you're singing along with wilbur to prove a point.
Tommy I morphed you with tubbo

Tommy: he was like my brother! Wilbur in hell: 😭
Why does it always cut to ph1lza being a bad***
Truly disgusting that MrBeast would do this horrible thing.

Tommy “but he was my friend, he was like a brother to me”  Me:I can hear Wilbur’s “don’t say that I will cry” from here
Plot twist: A real black hole with a 5' diameter whould have already the mass of neptune. (So you'd die even at the world border)
He changed all the names

thats my level 9 ice wizard for you -Slimecicle 2021
Fun fact: If you go into a black hole you get spaghettified. The scientific word called ‘Spaghettification’ is what happens when something enters a black hole therefore no footage can be taken of the inside of a black hole.
i feel like maybe if you ran most the time you could survive??
I'm literally two months older than tommy and every reference they make I get lmao

*DONT STOP MAKE IT POP-*
BuRh: chain!
WHY IS WIL INSANE IN EVERY VIFDEO
Bro the persona 5 music for philza lmao
1:22 *footage of Michael Jackson dying*
This was the funniest Wilbur Soot mental breakdown of all time
bruh I am 13 and I even understand the references
everyone is playing with the mod while Philza is speedrunning
This entire video is just a "That's what she said" compilation.
that lightning at 20:05 or so was the coolest thing that could have happened
When you’re 13 and understood every reference Will and Charlie made

When your 11 and you know all the references Charlie and Wilby are making
"what..." "wilbur?" *dying goat*
When your 16 and used to jam out to the songs Wilbur sang 🤭🔥
Charlie is just such a great addition to all of these videos
when you’re 14 and understand all those references 😐
"let's just row with it"   *silence of disappointment*
They cheated like 7 times lmaoooooooo
me who’s 13 and understood half of charlie and wilburs references 👁👄👁
"damnationem latine hoc est verum latine" on google translate is "English sentence that is true in Latin" but as an Italian whose language is the closest to ancient Latin it seems to me that Wilbur googled it wrong 😂
ok but I can read backwards but I still couldn't understand the demonic latin
HELLO EVERYONE WELCOME BACK TO THE FUNNNYNYNYNYNYNNYNY

I love the idea of a sci-fi movie where some sort of massive thing like Godzilla or a meteor is going to end the world and the heroic scientists are like 'Don't worry. We have a plan.' And they just go and throw random everyday objects at it like 'Throw the egg. No, that didn't work. Okay, throw the shoes. No...damn. Throw the chicken. DAMN I THOUGHT THAT WAS GOING TO WORK!' And then the world explodes. XD
Poor chickens

It was a dark and stormy night. Michael Jackson slowly started gliding into the black hole- saying his last words as he went; "Im moonwalking into a blackhole."
Petition for a compilation video with every time Wilbur has faced life changing circumstances in the mod videos and then proceeds to question existence itself
when they went into the end it was like the last mission of halo 3
the fact that i’m 13 and understood all of those references-
OMG 20:04 THE LIGHTING AGH
“damnationem latine hoc est vurem latine” I couldn’t be asked to check google translate, can someone translate the backward caption at 7:05?

Ok so at 7:08 Wilbur says “Damnation in Latin, Hoc est Verum Latine” Which does in fact translate to “Today we filled a pool with Orbeez
when you’re 12 and know all the songs
If you are 14 up and you recognized every song they sang like this coment
Its funny how at 18:8 you can see tommy ran a command in chat behind phil

The way this series involved to Phil and Tommy completing the game and Wilbur taking Charlie or Quackity into some weird roleplay is amazing.
Tommy loves his halo music
9:21 I FEEL THAT SOMETHING IS MISSING
Wilbur and Charlie: making references they think early 2000's kids don't know us: "are we not supposed to understand this?"
“That say that those that can’t do teach”

When you are 13 and you understand the dirty jokes
wilbur and charlie rlly thought we don’t know those songs
as a 13 year old, i understood all the references, wilbur i am disappointed
I understood every one:) and I’m 11
Anyone else just realized that he uses like the same face in every thumb nail
Philza's only role In these videos is to actually play tha game lmao
Me, a 14 year old: *Singing along with all the references they said we wouldn’t get*
WHEN THE THUNDER SHOWED THE BLACK HOLE I SHIT MY PANTS
15:39 dont click this its not important just a timestamp so i can continue watching later.........
i knew every single song wilbur n dr cicle was singing and i’m 14
Tommy was litterly at 4 million a few days ago how fast do u grow dude
Oh I just turned 9 on the 9th crazy
Finally tommy got a new graphics card
this is cool
20:23 i can't believe wilbur thinks 18 year olds don't know what toxic by britney spears or stronger by kayne west which sampled harder better faster stronger by daft punk which was featured in their animated movie interstella 5555 is
*Mr. Beast has joined the chat*
14:24 look carefully u can see tommy use the /locate command to see fortress coords
I AM PART IF THE 7 MILLION MILESTONE EEEEEEEEEEEE
is it just me or did philza go into creative
as a 14 year old I know those songs okey
I like how I'm 12 and watch tommy💀
Bro pls upload dream smp
English sentence that is true in Latin
I heard there was a special place Where men could go and emancipate The brutality and the tyranny of their rulers, Well, this place is real, you needn't fret With Wilbur, Tommy, Tubbo, fuck Eret, It's a very big and not blown up L'Manberg   My L'Manberg My L'Manberg My L'Manberg My L'Manberg   For freedom and for liberty Our nation sought to build on these A victory for all under democracy Well, the darkness came and then it went We built a home and watched it sink And from the rubble there emerged L'Manberg  My L'Manberg My L'Manberg My L'Manberg My L'Manberg
when charlie and wilbur was singing songs, im younger than most viewers and i know all of those songs. proved wilbur and charlie wrong.
7:54 hmm look in the chat someone is getting creative
HIS SHIRT IN THE INTRO—ITS NOT—ITS—WTFFF
Wilbur and Charlie just singing kesha while a black hole expands in the background is also how i cope in stressful situations
i’m so glad i understand their song references
Anybody notice how tommy uses cuphead music in all of his videos
I like how the Mario Galaxy music is really fitting
im 7                         JK
When i know every song they sing and i'm 13 lol
ok im like 12 right but yet I still understand all the all the songs they were singing
Wow, this child is very annoying. Why does he almost have 7 mil?
my name is terrance
I’ve just noticed that Wilbur and Charlie Simecicle’s text colors keep swapping throughout the video
It's funny because dream and his crew couldn't beat this. I wasn't philza on the next manhunt.

Wilbur and charlie trying to confuse the 14 year olds:  me, a 14 year old getting all those references:
All Tommy’s fans are 14,16,17 me here being 11

Jokes on you Wilbur, I got the reference old man.

The fact that Wilbur and Slimecicle thought Tommy's fans wouldn't understand Hamilton is baffling to me
The lightning was timed so well.
MrBeast is the lord of hell. Anyone who loses his challenges comes down with him.

Fun fact: Tommyinnit was born on his birthday!
World: ending. Phil: im getting diamonds.
Haha Wilbur and mr cicle I'm 12 and i understood all the references

Yes king 👑✨
The cuts between Philza single-handedly slaughtering the entire Blaze population to Persona music and then Tommy and Slime's casual boat race were pretty banterous ngl.

I’m happy that Tommy is color coding the text :)
Wow 6.66 million subs.... People sub. Seriously.

Tommy, don't go dissing the ender dragon like that. True, it doesn't get many fans, but most of your fans are edgy 14 years old that spend too much of their time on Twitter.
I feel like making this with a datapack is possible.
When tommy hits 6.66 million subscribers....
i just had a dream of a black hole coming to earth and i had to escape  to like another dimension or smthing and i died like several time but i could restart like its a video game

they would not be able to see the black hole as the only deffinition to the sight of a black hole is the super heated gas and super dense partical around the black hole they would also die from lack of oxygene as that would be first to get succed in

"everyone running from the hole" "ph1LzA just in the nether playing the game"
I'm frankly offended that Wilbur and Charlie don't think we know the godsend that is TiK ToK by Ke$ha

Bruh, Tommy is always going on about how awesome and skilled he is, and the one time he did something that requires actual skill, a.k.a spotting the lava pool by the sound, he says it's luck. I can't even-
Lol rn right as Wilber said kill the skeleton I get shot by a skeleton
Tommy go play with cxlvxn (calvin) it will be fun
Love the use of persona 5 song :3

Why is tommy on 6.66 subscribers Why am I scared Help
Oh no he has 6,66 million subs not good
No one: Absolutely no one: Tommy: 6.66M subs
Phil just being productive in the Nether while “Will Power” blares VS the adventures of Wil, Tommy, and Charlie running for their lives and screaming
Stereotypes in these videos: Wilbur - the weird one Philza - the one who Carrie's everyone to the end of the game, but is still a little bit weird Tommy - whatever the fuck he want do do a the time. Anyone else - mostly like Wilbur and for comedy value.
AYY 6.66M
Wilbur and Charlie said I wouldn't understand those song references and I knew all of them.
lel
At the time im writing this, Tommy is at 6.66mil subs.

Wilbur and charlie: doctah Tommy: still a child Phil: dudududu
How did I know those songs and I’m even younger than tommy
Also the sub thing is the devil’s number lol

The army is raiding Tommy to have subs
14:24 TommyInnit uses /locate in his Mc video reeeeeeee that is a sin omg omg omg      This is a joke by the way don’t send hate to tommy

I love how Phil is always on speedrun mode when the others are joking around lol [insert manhunt music]
He's turning into Dream.
Morgz has more subscribeers then you what the hell. Tom, shoukd have 30 million
17:19 - 17:45  God I love the effort Tommy and Larry put into the background music and the switch between the songs were so well done
The Persona music just makes Philza’s solo journey through the Nether so much more intense
Not wilbur thinking kesha and britney spears songs are obscure refences that 14 year olds won't get
Tommy says Phiiiiiil whenever he ......
every mod vid at some point Tommy is holding two bones or sticks
the fact that Tommy did /locate to find the fortress is funny

Wilbur meant "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"
I'm.9 and subbed since you're at 4M/5M

Persona 5 music plays Philza=Joker 17:26

“AAAAA”  -Thomas 2021
Tommy you have to change to another type of videos but still love you❤️❤️
What about RLcraft
"its an infinitely small particle"  the black hole: proceeds to grow absolutely massive and be a 'hole'
Wilbur: all of Tommy’s viewers are 14. Me: age 14 Also me: knows all the songs they just sang.
"English sentence that is true in Latin"
idec if they used cheats coz these vids are so godly and funny
Tommy got 6.66m lmao

I’m 14 and I understood all of those references
Get Tommy to 6.9 mil subs I think he will like that is you know what I’m saying 😏
Ah another series where philza is playing and others are having fun
When wilbur goes edgy cringe
Bruh, I swear tommy was at like 2 million not too long ago, congratulations man!
6,66 million, nice!
So we’re not gonna talk about Tommy’s sub count being 666?
Me : learned about black holes when I was like 14 and understanding all the comedy Tommy: what does two plus two equal
When you know all the songs they’re talking about 21:00...I’m so old now
Jokes on them I know all of those references
Think of the best most dramatic music  Tommy halo music  Me fuck yes
Me just understanding all the songs 😂😂😂
3:46  Tommy: "I have time, cause I'm young"  Phil: "I'm getting the belt"
When you see more of Will on the Gremlin's channel than is own: :')          No hate love ya will xx
Hey tommy... your at 6.66M if you know what I mean 😎
wilbur clearly has not been to a year 6 disco
For me he has 6.66k subs
Rn tommys subs are 6.66m
YOUR SUBS ARE AT DEVIL NUMBER!!!
Apparently trading with Pigmen was more worthy of Persona 5 music than running from a literal black hole
9:21 I thought Wilber would come back and say “I will cry”
tommyinnit
He has the amount of subs from satan .. but in mil
alternative title: two grown men peer pressure a child into almost dying while an old man does all the work.
Everyone agree tommy is better than wilbur
They are just talking a baut mrbeast:-)
Every mod they do they're panicking.  *Phil's just mining*
Playing Clash Royale kills
Is no-one gonna talk about Philza's theme song is just P5 boss music
Tommy is over acting the whole thing
Tomi in it: 6.66M subscribe 6.66: 666...
Omg tommys subs in 6,660,000

The editor did tommy wrong for the "wun" when he didn't say his r
His last words were: Hee hee                        Charlie slimesickle
Tommy said shout terrible words at him regrets 22:09 lol 😂😂😂

Good vid brother
Time slows down as you fall into a black hole, stretching you out more and more as you go in, until you're little more than a string paused in time by your perspective, stretching on into agony. Spaghettification is no joke.

Hi omg I your biggest fan ever
Philza being there for the big band, the birth of Queen Elizabeth II and now this what a life
Blacks holes crush you and people see you go red and freeze but for the person who is in the black home falls fast through a glowing black tunnel  And you get crushed and you skin peels off
Crazy to see this 16 yo YouTuber grow so much pretty quickly. Nice to see him put effort into his content without wanting all his viewers money like some others.
I like how Philza is the only one that cares about beating the ender dragon
A year ago he was saying  ‘We are getting close to 20k’ Now he’s saying ‘We are getting close to 7 million’  Congrats on the growth man

As we all know, if you're friends with MrBeast, you can solve every problem
Tommyinit saw the tutorial on 5 minutes craft😆
Best Part of the video 20:04
Tommy & Philza: swimming against the tides in the ocean.     Me: "People change like the tides in the ocean"
Another TommyInnit video! Probs gonna be chaos! 😂🤣
Why was tommy up at 11:05? Cuz I’m pretty sure he lives in England too.
I’m 10
me being 16 and knowing EVERY SINGLE REFERENCE AND SONG CHARLIE AND WILL MADE! i am elite
When Tommy says the word Inflating I am reminded of bad things I've seen :')
Why is all his thumbnails aleays the same
Why was the end so epic 😂
Oh my goodnes thats the one dantdm did but is growing
This was one of The Fucking funnyist videos you've made
Dream: gr gr you copy me sad
Where is Big Q
Tommy gain like 1.5millionsubs in a month 😇
Is it me- or every month/week tommy's subs increase to a million-
The ending was funny... I guess.
#1ontrendingOp
They where in creative when they died together slime and will
TommyInnit Is Not A Child, Hes A Man. And Im A Girl. wew
Tommy: *uses /locate fortress*  Also Tommy a few seconds later: wheres the fortress??
Good to know this mod is not the ‘funniest ever’ but just ‘very funny’
*6:26*  **Wilbur trying to explain what he saw**  *Tommy:* ayo, I got a basketball game tmr
Anyone else realise that they do many commands
FINALLYYYYY THE BLACK HOLE IS HERE
Wilbur:some of Tommy subscribers are 14 Tommy:some are 16 and 18 Me:some are 11
if schlatt copyright striked tommy all his videos would be gone cus he's there in every one of them ( 0:16 )
Noone: All of Tommy's titles since the new year: *funny*
Welll and some are 8 not 18
And the worst part is that it was globe im an all blocks game
Well, I think this Black Hole Mod is rigged. Why didn't entity nearby the Black Hole still can move, even though nearing Black Hole will stop your time that means you can't even move or talk (your mic will muted). By the way, you brought to the 4th dimension and die due to the lack of your body form of the 3rd dimension inside the 4th dimension.
When Tommy does anything it gets on Trending
I’m 12 and I understood all the references that we “wouldn’t understand” 😂
Dang number 4 trending for gaming
14:25 Tommy casually cheating🤣
I hope he upload the dream smp episode with dream in prison
Philza be listening to p5 music
Charlie cicle  is fucking weird 😐🥲
how do ya'll make a multiplayer server on your own??
Ah yes another amazing video where Philly actually focuses on beating the game and wilbur and Charlie do science and Tommy does Tommy things
The beastiality is strong in this one.
We need 1m more subs so it will be 6.66m       Btw.. wheres Tubbo? :(

I want quackity
*Phil* "Charlie which way would you like to die"  *Visible confusion *  *Charlie* "That sounds more like a threat than a question"  Yeah. No crap. Dude.
YESSSSSS FINNALY
I feel like Slimecicle is ruining Tommy’s videos  I don’t like him
Try all of the funniest mods together
Why the fuck is halo music playing during all of this
3:33 “Ph1lza was slain by an Iron Golem”  Everyone: *”it never happened”*
Can we all agree all of Tommy’s mod vids are extremely funny all of them made me die of laughter and if you didn’t you have sinned shoo
creeper. awww man

“Can’t belive you just implied that MrBeast is a lord of hell.” -Slimecicle 2021
Philza  has dream luck
I wonder why     No one in the vid (especially tommy) wanted to take a sh*t in the black hole
No, wilbur, im 18, yes i know the kanye west's stronger.
Good morning my fellow europeans that can watch his videos while eating breakfast

Tommy using cheats o.o 14:23

Philza: *Why do I always the things T-T*
Wilbur: What reference can we make that they won't understand?  *Wilbur we're gay.*
Love tommy
Dragon you have no fans  The drangon fans: ;-;

I didn't look at the thumbnail so I thought it was very different.
I've never clicked so fast on any video in my life until this series started
Oh my god that sequence of events right before they made it to The End, that was stressful
Badboyhalo be like if he was with phil  language
Tommy I know ur not asking for it but I know you need it. You aren't annoying you are amazing.👍
Wilber somehow always find a way to make a small plot or story in every single mode....the power of a writer within him is too strong.
When they sing I was like I know that song and I'm 2007 oo
If you will get 7mil subs thean you shoud do a 7mill special :)
How many balls are in this video?
LMAO NICE TRY WILL BUT YOU DIDNT CONFUSE ME I KNEW ALL THE SONGS
CONGRATS FOR  6.6 million subs
Anyone else notice the cod music
7:55 it’s probably to get him out of the void, but isn’t putting Philza in creative cheating?
Another video another cult created
Not going to talk about the chat
Tom, this video is very not etertaining nor funny. Im very dissapointed
Yes
Is it just me who got all the references they said we wouldn't get lol
Tommy: we finally beat a challenge Me: *that’s what you said last video*
Charlie and Wilbur trying to make references that the underaged wouldn't get but ending up singing songs that we all know, is the funniest thing to me
Everybody: we need to get as far as we can from that black hole! Ph1lza: PRO PLAYER MODE ACTIVATED
When they were singing old songs I couldn’t help but sing along, brings back memories :')
Wilbur do be good at clash royale
Fancy man
Question one why the fuck are you awake at like midnight. Question two will you ever see this at all.
Congrats on number three on trending for gaming TommyINNIT

The funny thing is I’m 14 and I get all those obscure references that Charlie and Wilbur were saying
*Every Saturday,8:00 am GMT+8.*     *Gosh,Malaysians and Philiphines need to woke up early for TommyInnit videos.*
Tommy referenced the office when he said "I thought it was all about the core"  Classic Gabe
The Mr Beast in Hell is The Mr Beast from MeatCanyon
humina humina humina humina humina humina humina humina humina humina
I knew every song they Wilbur and Charlie sang and I'm 12 would that be bad

Every TommyInnit video thumbnail: 😆
''that's my level 9 ice wizard tower for you'' me: there's no such thing
that was the most highest i’ve ever heard tommy yell “PHIL WE NEED HELP- *HELP!”* 15:14
When you understand the references | |
14:10 editing error?
Hey tommy try to beat dream sub :)
20:07 genuine fear

Jokes on you , I have musical parents, I get every. Single. Reference

When Tommy needs video ideas:     *FUNNY*
Hey, fun fact for those who didn't know: you can switch tabs by holding ctrl and pressing numbers.
1:23 "heehee-" fucking dies
20:05 ok that was kinda epic
The last part was hilarious the last second of video is just omg no words cant stop laughing

tommy sets philza’s gamode to creative*
I like how Wilbur and charlie were like most of tommys fans are like 14 they won't understand any of these songs and I'm over here singing along with them fkjewhwejk
Wilbur and Slimecicle doing a science experiment, Tommy struggling to get away from the hole..    Philza founding 8 diamonds
Lol the halo and modern warfare music
shout out to tommy's t-shirt for being in pretty much every thumbnail
Suddenly Philza had 3 stacks of gold in his inventory😂😂😂
When are u back on the snp
I have The Best Combination For a Mod (Big q) (Doctor sccle) (Ph1lza) (Wilbur Soot) and of course you tommy so plz do the next mod with all these people plzzzzz and thank you if u did it but if no             fuck you
Oof
*Philza: *Makes immense trade** *Tommy, Wilbur, and Charlie: *Hey look! Polar bears!**
Pog new video
Who need tommys discord server
Looks like he got a new camera, poggers
a song that they use in the bastion is off just cause 3 i love that game thats how i noticed
who else is watching at 2am  my eyes hurt to keep open and my knees and ankles feel like they’re broken
Thanks for making me feel bad about being 23 🥴
This is the mod the dteam used? :)
I know a of wilbur and Charlie's references and I'm only 12
14:10 what is that subtitles
Phil just speed-runs the game while everyone else goofs around every time they do these videos
20:05 i can't even see it.. *SCREAMING 🤣
1 thing that i always remember on tommy's video is "funny"
Everyone: *Planning, Collecting, Running, Stressed*  Charlie: ...Guy’s what’s your favorite Jetpack Joyride jetpack 😁?!
I don't know how tommyinnit is annoying he's really funny to watch and his subscribers think otherwise
When Tommy said “he was like a brother to me” I was expecting Wilbur to reply back like always with “stop it you will make me cry” 🤣 Also Philza having the time of his life completing the game while Tommy,Wilbur and slime are running away from the black hole.🤣 Also omg the music actually made it so intense when the black hole got so close quickly and they all entered the end except Charlie.
@MrBeast needs to comment
Make episode of morph mod and size mod at once
People who got all the songs have to like this
Here before 7 mil 😳😳
One thing we know for sure: Wilber goes crazy in every video, Charlie sometimes too, Tommy’s just being Tommy and Phil actually tries to beat the game  Also so close to 7 million subs! You definitely deserve it Tommy. Love your content keep up the good work ❤️
Congrats on 1 on trending Again

0:54 Editor larry you got charlie's colour wrong, *SHAMEFUL*
.
Oh I am 10
I cant tell why but i got all of wilbur and charles references
The music cutoffs and the Halo music was 100% on point
If black holes is the one of the only two things Tommy is scared of, then what's the other thing ?
Wilbur saying how all of Tommy's fans are 14: Me who's 13: ;-;
My volume was so high at 2:50AM and Tommy started yelling
this video had more lore then all dream smp seasons combined
Wilbur- there all 14 Me-well iam 12

My favorite part is when they started to sing toxic by Brittny spears

21:26 in that moment, tommyinnit knew, he had to run the fuck away.
Eyyy Philza with the Persona music in the background
You can do the 1000 mod challenge
Just before @8.00 Tommy set Phil to creative
18:27 just row w it
black hole go brr
The speed of the subs is comparable to US cases
OMG It have 2 million views after 9 hours
When you realise that the dragon may be a girl  (Sad dragon noises )
Gusty gardens has the best music in smg. Change my mind
I love how everyone makes fun of Tommy's titles for these videos
Good job on number 1 on trending
stayed subbed
Bruh i knew it wilbur plays cr
Tommy:what is heaven like Wilbur:it’s red and hit
11:25 _ppl change like the tides in the ocean, at least I think or am I dead wrong?_
lololololololololol
They are animals
At this point they dont need a mod to be funny LOL
why did philza go into creative 7:52
Cow
Your welcome tommy
Tracker
Why is Wilbur always soooooo annoying
19:30 is wilbur Just playing Clash Royale ? XD
Shark

Black
God link your mod or I will unsubscribe to you and will like drem
Respec for the halo music
The black hole in the distance looks like Jack Manifolds Head
Tommy’s laugh are so fake but it is so funny 😂
I like trains
21:35 Tommy's blood pressure is dropping
we want quackity again!!!
Sad bcz the camera wont focus at wilbur clash royale name
Every episode of funniest mod  ever  Philza carries
Mods are cool but its getting a bit boring tbh
This was more intense than manhunt
I can't wait for mrbeast to comment on this video
TommyInnit is saving 2021 with the dreamsmp members ngl
pls upload more videos
My Brain Reading The Title of The Video: 👌🏿
I knew all the references and im 12 :/
Wilbur speaking "latin" translates to: English sentence that is true in latin😂
My mum: (my name) WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU WATCHING?!? Me:(calm as hell) a 16 yr old child with swearing problems
slimecicle and Wilbur tryna call us 14 yr olds  out smh. well jokes on u i know those references.  lmao
I want smp back
Tommy, Charlie, and Wilbur: "Slowly being consumed by the black hole"  *meanwhile, Philza is busy being Doomslayer*
It's not really the mod that's funny it's them
I now know how to get 1 billion robux on fortnite.
im just waiting until Mr. Beast will appear here :D
im addicted to youuu
Bitch I'm 12
Bruh can remake this video with tubbo and big q and jack manifold
My only goal for twitch/youtube us to be in one of these tommyinnit mod videos
/locate fortress LMAO 14:23
I'm really appreciate how Slimecicle and Wilbur conversation about viewers age went to singing "Kanye West - Stronger" and "Ke$ha - Tik Tok".
I remember this mod..
Everyone else rowing away from the black hole, whilst Philza is having the time of his life in the nether. Hilarious.
"go speak to karl jacobs bitch!" HAHA
0:16 schlatt tho he surprised that ur almost at 7 million subs
Tommy: i’m a golden boy Me: 👁👄👁 *not the wattpad*
18:38 I know that music in the background, that’s Will Power from Persona 5.
17:25  is someone awakening his persona somewhere?
no one gonna talk about tommy quoting road trip??? he goes like the tides in the ocean then smiles but no one said anything :/
Are you actually 6 foot 3
THIS VIDEO WAS SO GOOOOD
Ph1lza is doing everything
Some are 14 15 16 and 18 me and my friend who are 12 "what about us!
da best ending
Is it me or is philza the only one working for gear and to get to the end
20:04 THAT was scary
im 10 not 14 16 or 18
I can hear Persona 5 Boss Music in the Background
they literally cheated every 2 seconds
This is a really funny video 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
i love how Wilbur just casually goes insane in some of Tommy's videos
7:51 Look at The chat
where is quackity
I- 😂
14:24 '' the nearest fortress is at ( coordinates ) '' people who thought those things were actually fair: my dissapointment is inmesurable and my day is ruined
At 14:25, i like how he used /locate.
Im literally the same age as tommy and i knew every reference wilbur and charlie made
What in the world was so bad that even Tommy had to censor it?
Wilbur : the stars laughed at me  Tommy: do you wanna shoot hoops with us🤣🤣🤣🤣
16:24 I just find it cool that tommy used the just cause 3 heat level music
"If I get sucked in, THEN what? I DON'T KNOW"  Idk why but like that actually stuck with me
poor PhiLza
I love this mod so much
14:10 smh, the editor messed up with the subtitles, how trash, smh smh smh smh smhtrfjfrhjlftgjkfgjjjjj
WHERE IS QUACKITY
19:33 was clash royale not clash of clans
You sound like tommyoutit
I’m offended they think that I don’t know about jet pack joyride and clash of clans and other 2010 games like cut the rope
More funnni
*Ph1LzA has set their gamemode to creative*
i thought i subscribe but i did not THIS IS A DISGRACE
why is mr beast a stable advertisement for a portion of the video
At 22:55 philza went into creative?
10:07 "Wilbur Soot: Set own game mode to Survival Mode... why are we watching this?
when will you play in the dream smp
Can we have Quackity in some of these mod videos again, and charlie as well ofc!
I was in a forest just looking for some tasty mud....       I like it too
Good job on trending!
Its 'suckin'
As a 14-year-old viewer of tommyinnit I can say I know all of those songs.
in everyone one of these Philza is always working hard when everyones just joking around
I love how Wilbur and Slimecicle know who the target demographic of Tommyinnit is
21:50 a heroic moment
I think that they should count their deaths lol
Pov ur looking for mr beast comment
Tommy):willbur?  Me:and I oop
I Iove that every video it’s Philz’s bearing the game while the rest provide us goofs
“Nothing is dangerous when your the tommyinnit” famous last words
I think the black hole may have achieved heaven
POV: he already has 7 million subscribers 🧍🏻‍♀️
1:23  **hee-heed too hard**
soooooo funny and i am subbed
I'm too early
I like the music used, being Animal Crossing and Will Power from Persona 5
i love it how im 14 yet i understood all the references that slime and will made
14:25 look at chat they used a thing to find the fortress nice
The JC3 music in the background is amazing
Hello Tommy my name is Tom as well
Tommy is pog
that just cause 3 music in the background gave me flashbacks
BRUH. Wilbur and Charlie you let me down. I am literally 12 and I know TikTok
Anyone else see at 14:27 tommy had a RTX 3090 and a ryzen 9 JESUS CHRIST

If we get him to 7.M he will grow 7 years older and 7 inchs taller- xD so he wont be child
Anyone else saw this or is it just common for them to use commands? 14:24
just cause music?
Wilbur: all of tommy's fans are 14 Me being 48 years old with a wife and 3 children: 👁️👄👁️
the fact that this is the hardest mod to beat and they did it is crazy

"I've seen into the blackened eye of the event horizon. There is no screams. I called to the stars and they laughed at me." - Wilbur Soot, 2021  pure literature, art, beauty and grace. made me shed a tear

I love how phill was the only one that was trying
I’m happy I understood all the references that will and Charlie made
2:16 rare footage of slime trying to be enderman or the hand and trying to erase block
The funny thing is yeah I'm like 13 14 and I know all the songs that Wilbur and Dr sickle were talking about
Tommy’s content now is just
Are we all going to ignore the fact that Philza went into creative. Tommy set him to it in the middle the egg fiasco
Oki
Just wanna say congrats on getting #1 trending for gaming
it looks like tommy will in 3 months have more subs then dream

7:07 the word just said  "English sentence, this is true in latin"
7:54 Tommy put Phil in creative

The blackhole at the start: Me slow  At the end: I'M SPEED
I forgot yesterday was Friday
I wish quackity was there
Anyone else see that Phill got destroyed by a iron golem at 3:34
As someone born in 98’ I thoroughly enjoyed the Charlie & Wilbur singalong 😤
9:53 juju.
MrBeast will use a golden whip on you if you don't subscribe rn

7:53 why was Phil's turned into creative?

WHERE IS DREAM

Tommy does /locate to find the fortress lmaooo
Fun fact: if Tommy doesnt laugh at your joke it means that you made the worst joke in history
Was I supposed to not supported to understand any of the songs Charlie and Wilbur were singing? Because I’m pretty sure that those songs came out when I was like 4 or 6.   At this point I have no idea
I love how wilbur and slimecycle was just singing 2000 songs or sumn
Its not funny thats ....... thats terrifying
YAT ANOTHER VID
Wilbur and Charlie singing the older songs to confuse Tommy's viewers kills me because that means I'm getting old now.😔
#1 trending for gaming 🔥🔥🔥🔥 wow that's poggies
It's always the weird comments first
15:06 Tommy said (set Ph1lzas gamemode to creative)
geting closer to10m
Try the "hbm's nuclear tech" mod with forge (sadly cant use with fabric)
I feel like Tommy is getting so famous he can’t even fully express it on camera. Lol. Jk love ya tommy. No homo

Pogchamp

Bamnationem latine, hoc est verum latine 🦖💨

Imagine: this is canon and tommy is just dreaming all this in the prison and it's a metaphor of how tommy is never going to get away from dream and lose everyone close to him to dream. He's inevitable.
Tommy, planning to get a haircut?😂 U look like u definitely need one
HILARIOUS
It's not that funny without quackity
I like how it just: wilbursoot set own game mode to survival mode
Everything is funny for you
Wilbur: all of tommys fans won't understand cuz there all 14 Tommy: there not all 14 some are 16 some are 18 Me: ok so am i the only one here thats 9 ;-;

I like Women
Jokes on them I know toxic and stronger
I want a black hole, and I want one now. And I want to name it ✨clementine✨
#we_need_big_q
Am I the only person that noticed that when philza was getting ender pearls and blaze rods there was music from persona 5 playing in the video
Video idea: "we put all minecraft's funniest mods at the same time and it was hilarious"
14:10 editor Larry didn't get enough sleep, he started missing the captions...  F to pay respect for editors.
15:48 and all he had to do was die
Ngl, when charlie didn't make it, that felt genuinely sad
That was the most craziest escape ever 21:52
when tommy said “he was like a brother to me”  i half expected wilbur to chime in and say “i will cry”
I just realized that you pasted technoblade in subs
Wow, persona 5 music really fits Tommy's vids
Next video:another funniest mod ever
20:55 wun? Excuse me? Did tommy just talk neko for 1 second?
It keeps getting weirder   Just getting weirder
Tommy:and you can unsubscribes at any time! trolls:subs then unsubscribes
did Wilbur just assume we don't know toxic by britany spears.....hmmmmm
I’m sooooooo early
(*:
ELIZA!! AUOWH ELIZAAA!!
21:49 I died on this one
Hater: They only watch Tommy for Wilbur Then why tf are we subbed hmm, if we were here for wilbur then we'd FUCKING watch Wilbur.

Cuphead music. Choice
Next up:  Minecraft's Modern Warfare Mod is so funny
Tommy has a 3090 wtf?!?!
Are you sure this a mod, because it looks like Dream's Plugin to me.
When you get all of the ‘obscure’ references they’re making and Tik Tok was one of your favourite songs as a kid-
I love it when they are all messing around and Philza is silently mining diamond and getting ressources every time lol
I love how all the 'obscure references' were songs I grew up listening to.
One could say Wilbur died to BONES
I Love your videos they are insane!
Im 10 and i know that toxic by britney spears im cultured
Swear to God, Ph1lza moments are the fucking cherry on this cake of a video

"I've got trousers."

Any other 14 year olds understand all of Wilbur’s references to old 2000s songs?
Tommyinnit is not gonna like this comment

I’m 11 and I got all of the references lmao
Mr Beast

4:55 Emm editor forgot to change text colors for Wilbur and Charlie
1:21 is how Michel  Jackson died
My brain:beated My mind:bleached My history:deleted My life:ruined
Aye tommy my ideal
when they think no one will vibe with them cause "everyone watching is 14 "and I'm just here like "PEDICURE ON MY TOES TOES TRYING ON ALL MY CLOTHES CLOTHES...." with them
When they went in the end portal right before the hole ate them it gave me interestelar vibes idk why

Phil awakening his persona

Ur mum
why you not do video at Dream SMP ??
Anyone noticed the persona 5 boss theme in the middle of the video?
20:06 that was awesome timing
I stab children for coins
Fun fact: dream made a video about surviving this mod before he became famous and that was when I found his channel cause I was searching some fun mc mods to try out with my friends and it ended up being dream's video.
Wilbur:wh. Tommy:wilbur?..

“They’re all 14 let’s make references they don’t understand” *understands all of them and is younger then 14*

Tommy looks so tired by the end😂 I would love to know how long The recording actually was
Real title: *Laughing for 22 minutes 55 seconds straight*
The ending 😂😂😂😂
22:04 f3+d moment lmao
“what something we can say that Tommys viewers wont understand” me: knows every song by heart
Wilbur:Most of them are 14 so- *sings song references they think we don’t understand* Me and probably some other 14 year olds: *Sing along knowing the lyrics and artists well*
Trending pog
Tommy on the Next Video: We've just discovered a mod that will cause Wilbur to grow to the size of the Moon!
You should do vain miner
Tommy cannot make a video without the word funny

I like how nothing can ruin techno's bad upload schedule  He doesn't even join these XD
I’m 15 and I knew all those songs
tommy is only scared of two things, *black holes* and *american women*
My favorite Tommyinnit saying, “Wun”

Mr.Beast have to see this
I think that me being 15 and knowing all those songs and references and being proud about it says a lot about my childhood and family life 🥲🥲
1:27 I CAN'T BREATHE LMAOO
Oh no, now the comment replies are filled with self-promotion and ads. I feared this stage of popularity will come eventually, but didn't anticipate it to come so soon.
Tommy I understand that all your mods are funny, but just chose *one* to be the *funniest*.....
Wilbur & Charlie: Sings and claims teens won't know them. Me, a 16-year-old that loves early 2000's: LOL you THOUGHT
And to this day he is still having mr beast burger...
tommy: they're not ALL 14 yr olds... me, a 14 yr old: 😁
Where is dream in this video ? :(
7:51  tommyinit set philzaminecraf to creative mide
A lot of the subtitles in the video seem bugged, they appear at the wrong times or are previous text, just felt like pointing that out
Hi I love tommyinnit channel
Black hole my enemy

Tommy really does see Phil as his dad "Phiiiilll I don't like black holes" "Phil I'm getting pulled" "Ohh Phil I got golden trousers :D"
7:49 look at the bottom left
I thought the halo soundtrack was copyrighted but I guess not :/
I like your vids and im not even english
I can't even say "that's what she said" enough times to fully clarify this video
10:08 Do you see anything wrong with this scene?-
Ngl he might pass dream in subs im not joking
Tommy’s a jerk
Me: Mom! Can we get Smooth Criminal CD?  Mom: We already have Smooth Criminal  Smooth Criminal at home: "I'm going in a black hole!" "You've been pulled by... You've been sucked by... a Black Hole!"  "YEOW!"

MrBeast is basically god

I remember when you hit 1mil and now your almost at 7mil
14:24 (uses /locate) Lmao
“we should crash into it for romance and drama” Very romantic tommy

“I have time because I am young”                                                  -tommyinnit 2021
"They're all 14, what's some references they wouldn't understand?" sUCKS TO SUCK, I GREW UP IN A FAMILY WHO LISTENED TO ALL TYPES OF OLD SONGS HAHA I KNEW EVERY ONE OF THOSE
Wilbur Soot always becomes a traumatized Magnus Archives character in these videos at one point or another.
I was literally just singing with slime and wil even tho I’m 12 I still know all the stuff :)
"GO SPEAK TO KARL JACOBS BITCH"
Hi

Unity's particle system
"Lets just row with it "
It’s seems like this Tommy individual is a very funny lad
I can imagine how tommy will have more subscribers than dream,I hope this will happen someday
Who remembers dream doing this
tommy: obsidian is the strongest block in game. bedrock: am i a joke to you?
Please make video on dream smp
“Heehee” *dies*
Wilber... Dr Sicle, I got every reference you made you have failed 😂
This channel has no right to use halo music. If your subscribers weren't alive to play it on the original xbox, they have no right to be blessed by its melody.
Nobody: The chat: *[Ph1LzA: Set own game mode to Spectator Mode]*                   *[Tommyinnit: Set Ph1LzA’s game mode to Creative Mode]*
I watch these videos religously
Ayup
Now this is content.
Hey, thanks for adding me in it.
ay you dont have your red shirt
Wilbur either starts a nation, starts a cult, or dies. Or bonus ALL THREE!
20:04 was terrifying
“WHERES CHARLIE?”  *he got consumed.*
That ending had me cackling but also Wilbur made me kinda self conscious of the fact that I'm watching your videos at 22 lol /j
Tommy u are the best
4:33 microscope rooms get RIDICULOUSLY hot. Spent a summer working in a hospital lab, was easily the hottest room in the entire building
22:35 "we finally beat a challenge" the previous 2 + the voice mod says otherwise
Wilbur playing Clash Royale while fleeing a giant black hole on a boat has to be the funniest thing I've seen today
5:54 if you pronounce the t in basketball, you get beat up.
The fact that tommy wears the sane shirt is funny i agree that he is piss pants
Can you do a halo gameplay? I honestly can’t picture you in a shooter focused game and I feel like that would make it so much more entertaining to watch.
Nice that you guys won (legitley)
Finally lol
Why did this feel like one of Lord of the Rings movie??
I can’t wait to die and see how funny it is slimecicles famous last words
His hair looks different
This video made my day happier and better ☺️
Hi
wow
i love it whenever tommy says that wilbur is like a brother to him, it always feels so wholesome
Dude when they started singing kesha i staryed vibing
Tommy is god of cheater😂😂😂
Why wilbur is more funny than Tommy?
Why did I die laughing at  "there's a blackhole behind us" "Oh would you look at that"
HOLY SHIT THEY WERE PLAYING MUSIC FROM JUST CAUSE 3!!!
And of course the first time Phil does die, it’s not because of the Mod, but because he pissed off the Iron Golem.
I am the rare tommyinnit fan who knows the song stronger by kanye west. Also, the minigun is a pretty decent jetpack joyride jetpack, even though it is the starter one lmao. Edit: 20:59 TIKTOK ON THE CLOCK CAUSE THE PARTY DON'T STOP- Who knew slimecicle and wilbur soot have great music taste.
The shocking government seasonally race because latex daily invent besides a plain wash. yummy, spooky yellow
Me being 16 knowing all the songs😭😂
I like how wilbur just rows into the black hole
"oh tha-" "YOU ARE A FOOL"
"oh it's destroying blo- *got sucked in the black hole*'
"Damnationem latine, Hox esverum latine" Dis, is da real translate. (BTW i see it from dam mirror)
Thick...
I LOVE the Rockstar music playing when Phil was going in the nether for pearls and blaze rods 😭
Never expected to hear Will Power while Phil was just vibing out in the nether but it's a pleasant surprise nonetheless
Tommy:did you saw jimmy the lord of hell Mrbeast:go away omg no more challenges and money for you
I love you an willbers love life its soooo cute
I wonder how Mr.Beast feels after this- is this a hint 👀
TOMMY USED PERSONA 5 MUSIC FUCK YEAH
Wilbur: “Im am not traumatized by the hellish black hole...” Tommy: “DOES THAT MEAN YOU WANNA DO DRUGS AND SHOOT HOOPS?”😂
Hello
YOUTUBE UNSUBBED ME WHYYYYY
11:12 i love that reaction 10/10
The most terrifying parts were when the black hole was revealed by lightning and when Tommy was being chased by it
gonna be honest: this is actually a terrifying mod right here
Mr.beast watching be like:😑😑😑
MY FAV YTUBER UPLOADED AGAIN
Jeez Tommy’s channel is like getting a million subs every 2 videos now
lol
He gained 20,000 subs in 6 hours. Congrats tommy your doing great
“before i go i’ve got something to tell you” “yeah” “i wanna say to you male chickens don’t lay eggs why were you calling it a he......” *voice fades* *scared noise* “WHAT HAVE I DONE!?” *cries*  *2 seconds later* “so uhh- wilburs dead” *laughs* “oh well!”
i hope phil’s back is alright 😔
i enjoyed😁
wow 5,000 subs in one day
POG 1# TRENDING IN GAMING
Wilbur Wilbur Wilbur,, have you heard of the “Not being fucking chaos incarnate every mod ep” challenge?
*Hello, could you please visit my channel, because I make awesome short films!*
I love how philza always plays the game normally
me, younger than 14, understanding all of wilburs references
haha black hole funey
0:44,1:06,1:18,1:21,2:15,2:29,2:34,3:50,5:00,5:08,6:15,8:41
I Wonder what would happen if you go to max build height, and attached a lead to a boat and sat in it
What is with Tommy and the name Clementine? 😂
IM 13 AND I UNDERSTAND ALL THE REFERENCES WILBUR AND SLIMECICLR SAID
Poor chiken i love chikens
Tommy: Charlie look its like we're moonwalking Charlie: heeh- OH OH
no one: absolutely no one: me:sees the bottom right that phil went creative mode ami the only one?
PERSONA OST LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
Poor chiken i love chikens
How old does Wilbur think Tommy’s followers are. Or how old those songs are lmao. Those songs aren’t as old as he thinks they are
Oof i thought the person in the pic was Tubbo but nvm☠
You can tell when Tommy said "he was like a brother to me" that he was waiting for Wilbur to come back just to say "Please don't say that, I will cry"
Did anyone notice that charlie and wilbur switched to creative mode
Tommy's thumbnails are tempting me to analyze the life cycle of Tommy warcrys/laughs.
Tommy: “dragon, Ypur a bitch and you got no fans Me, a furry: *i cease to exist then*
Y E S
4:45 bruh text Color Confuse Check
I scarred
Sadly, I know all of those references.
jokes on you wilbur and smile i understood all those references
Yo the persona music at 17:28 got me hype
7:10 Today I have to do a test of latin and I see it in the video... now I want to stab myself 37 times in the chest...
11:19 (ignore)
Dang they rlly thought their references were obscure enough but little did they know I was raised right so I knew literally e v e r t t h i n g
Omg the persona music when phil was in the nether had me wheezing
tommy and wilbur and charlie: hahahaha joking yayaya phil: *SPEEDRUNNNNN*
EPIC
tommys was in CHARACTER character
*starts talking about dark shit* “Wanna shoot hoops with us?”
Who’s gonna tell Wilbur that we know all the songs-
In all those videos phil is actually trying to beat the game and help the others, he just looks like a dad
Liked the mario galaxy music in the beggining.
“We beat up nerds” TommyInnit says, despite nerds being his target demographic
anyone gonna mention the persona music? just me? ok.
The glitch just happened to me when i look on my notifications i was surprised to not see any tommy video i mean i want to tell me is channel and i found that i wasn't subscribe even though i don't remember unsubscribing
Not even two minutes in and everyone has died at least once expect for fucking Phil 😂😂
man the fact that this channel is growing so fast.
the fact wilbur thought 14 year olds wouldn't know toxic by Brittany Spears is just-
I'm 14 and I knew all those songs
Piss reference: Check Wilbur goes insane: Check Drug references: Check This really is the funniest mod.
I just wanted to say this because I have a heart of gold.💛 I hope you know, that you are loved by over 6 million people. Those 6 million people do not think you are annoying, or childish, or loud. They love you!❤️ If anybody ever tells you that you are annoying, or irritating then ignore them. They are just too stupid to see past their fat nose. Because of you many people are happier; because you of many people have amazing careers in YouTube! You have inspired and made so many people happy! I wanted you to know this because we all love you!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️I hope you have an amazing year with Philza, Wilbur, Charlie, JackManifold, Quackity, Tubbo, and etc.
Me a ksp player: did someone say SPAGHETTIFY?!?
An I’m 12
Me a 13 year old girl knowing all of the songs and references Charlie and Will were making that we wouldn’t get 🧍‍♀️
I wonder how mrbeast react about this
Tommy: "We finally beat a fucking challenge..."  As they have beaten almost every challenge they have done.
WILBUR SINGING KANYE WEST
Does nobody realise that larry literally forgot about the caption colors for charlie does nobody actually realise it changes
Lmao
“So uh, Wilbur’s dead.” “Oh well!”
20:34  My Dan and Phil phase when I was 12 has prepared me for this moment
21:49  Top 10 anime escapes
Tommyinnit is only annoying when he says he annoying
When Wilbur was talking about the event horizon and spaghettification I actually understood what he meant!! I feel smart
13:08 im above im above what he meant to say im below im bleow LAVA!!!!
Black hole vs White hole?
Oh oh aaaaaah its pulling me! - Famous last words
He was like a father to me...
For like an hour after this i felt like someone was lightly tugging on my back
skfjskdks wilbur and charlie: what obscure references will tommy’s fan not get....ah yes extremely popular 2000s songs
I love how some scenes were legitimately intense and then immediately after them it would just cut to some funny moment
We want quackity
This one wasn't good tbh  Either the mod was bad or u had a quackity or schlatt missing
Tommy “runs towards piglin brute its fine I have gold trousers”   Gets one shot yep definitely
Love the cup head music
The fact that I understand everything and I am just older then tommyinit 😶
*Phil doing a 5 years hardcore*
‘My fans aren’t all 14’ Me: *14 years old*
tommy: some are 16 some are 18 everyone under 14:
I'm unsubbing
That went into creative
Wilbur and slimesicle have entered the subspace...
Wdym? Your a millionaire you have 200 mil subs?
this video should be called phil has a great time in the nether while the others get sucked
“i- i’m about to find out how funny this is i can’t wait to get hilariously plunged into the space! :D” *a millisecond later* “ah SEE YA” *dies*
No one gonna about the fact tommy is halfway from 7mil. His fame is like Tommy’s ego. BIG
Nobody:  Me: *continues Wilburs lyrics in Hamilton numbers*
"go to speak to karl jacobs bitch!"
Facts heaven is red and black
let your haters be you motivators
I genuinely think these videos are hilarious
I’m  seven years old and I’m a subscriber and I now swars
It's like I'm watching a Action/Horror movie at the end holy shit
"I SPOTTED THAT WITH MY EARS PHIL"-TommyInnit2021

The screen was black the entire time I watched it
Everytime i see ur mod vids i always see the word "funny"
Dang this is scarier than any other horror movie I've seen. Even the characters make some pretty dumb decisions
7:49 Turnz into a morgz video
Wilbur: CHARLIE DONT STOP-   me: BELIEVIN'
this is the best youtuber ever
Tommy: fock you aaaaaaaaaaa   Wilbur: phycopath mindset  Charlie: lay the egg!!!!!  Philza: *Speedruning music*
As a physics nerd, I enjoyed this video way too much
If you guys aren’t sub to tommy what are you doing with your life sub to him now if you don’t you will never have a future
I love how Tommy copys Dreams version of mods. Then remakes them 10 time’s funnier

I am kinda starting to dislike Wilbur because he starts saying rubbish things out of know where. He also suddenly starts acting strange and he thinks that it is funny. 🙄. I am not giving hate but can't they be normal like philza beating the game or tommy joking around while beating the game.
I love how Wilbur and Charlie some how make some kind of cult or religion
Clemetine is tommy go to name
Tommy: Phil where have you gone? Phil:I'm getting diamonds :D
"tommy i think we don't have any time here" "well i got time cuz im young"  i am deceased

Wow

How funny is this mod???
Congrats on almost making 7 mil 🥺

TommyInnit is soon gonna beat Dream in subs
Am I the only one who has noticed the Omori music playing in Tommy’s recent videos??
The music when they jumped into the end portal was really dramatic and made me feel like I'm watching a real disaster survival movie because there are sooo many characters we love being killed with dramatic music👍👍👍👍👍.
nice persona music
"I've seen into the blackened eye of the event horizon. There is no screams. I called to the stars and they laughed at me" is such a raw fucking line and I cannot BELIEVE it came from a Tommyinnit video
7:49 look In chat....
9:21 Wilbur behind the scene: No stop Tommy I will cry
Wilbur gets awfully philosophical during these things, it scares and deeply concerns me 20:35 Wilbur that’s Toxic by Brittany Spears Then Charlie referenced Hamilton TikTok by Ke$ha is a fucking bop Wilbur who the hell doesn’t know TikTok
In this challenge, tommy is SO STRESSS
Loved the persona music in Phil’s bit
Lets see how many Subs❤️🎈 I can get from the comment section❤️  Current 57❤️

me, a 14 year-old girl, understanding all of their references
What I think is weird is that there is a hole smp group but I only like watching Tommy, I tried watching them all and tommy is the funniest and the best one idk why

13:40 the most dramatic piece of cinema ive ever seen, wilbur and charlie make such a good duo lmao
Nah I'm staying subscribed😼
Me over here vibing as Charlie and Wilbur sing songs that I know
IVE GOT A THEORY!!  Let’s take a look at sams prison rq more specifically its name, it’s called Pandora’s vault which is a wierd thing to call a prison! Unless it was intentional. Just for shiz and giggles I looked into the myth of Pandora’s box and I am officially scared for the future of the dream SMP, lemme summarize it for you. Pandora was given two gifts by zues, the trait of curiosity and a box she was told she could never open. Obviously with this new curiosity it was killing her that she couldn’t look in the box. One day she was thinking “what if I just took a peek” she opened it and all the darkness and evil flew out, but what also flew out was hope. She gave the earth darkness but she also gave it hope, let’s apply this to the server. What is in Pandora’s vault. Two things or people, one of which being dream who is a great representation of darkness and evil on the server, then we have tommy who in this problem would be hope on the server. So being able to get tommy out, or hope, would also need to get dream out, The evil. Now I was thinking “who is our pandora in this situation?” And I think it’s pretty obvious. Our beloved of course! Who is quickly becoming the main character.   SPREAD THIS MESSAGE! IF YOU COPY IT MAKE SURE TOO CREDIT ME!!
So tommymods now?
If you heart this comment I will subscribe to you with both of my channel so pls heart my comment tommy
Where is dream smp stuff ?
TOMMY YOUR NUMBER 2 ON TRENDING
“They’re all fourteen, what references are they not going to get” **proceeds to sing all the songs 14 years olds strive off of**
Gotta give them props for spitting some science Wilbur said it’s and infinitely small particle, referring to the singularity
why do i hear persona 5 music?
9:42

i wana die of old age
Tommy: Obsidian = strongest block Bedrock: you dare challenge me!?
Dam that black hole ruthless
I love your vids they make me happy and your not anoing
Gotta say, that halo music was very fitting right before you jumped into the end portal. It reminded me of halo one when you have to escape on the autumn or whatever and everything around you is falling apart
17:26 Persona music?!
"most of his fans are 14" <starts singing toxic, stronger and tiktok> please theyre literally only 3 years before i was born ofc i knew these songs 😭

The funny part about this is that dream, sapnap and george did this but they were more serious and they still failed but tommy, phil, wilbur and slimecicle beat it and there were like 90% not serious the 10% is just philza working hard
anyone noticed that his thumbnail face is the same as other funniest mods
0:09 press alt f4 to pay respect for wilbur
I'm 14 and I understand the references
i love that philza is the only one who plays the game
I love his videos so fucking much there so funny 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Slimecicle: We "cracked" the vote  Me: That is an "EGGcelent" pun
Why does Wilbur have a cultish spiritual awakening every video?
The Halo music at the end was so perfect dude
AT 7:44 WHEN WILBUR DID THE HEAD TILT THING FOR THE WHOLE “being taken over” THING I STARTED TICKING LMAO DAMMIT

Who else knew all the songs Wilbur and Charlie were singing even tho you were born after the 2000's
the first 23 seconds was funny
Oh boy the funny 16 year old has almost 7m subscribers, congrats btw tommy
why at 7:40 when wilbur calls charlie “doctor cicle” it sounds like an ice pop brand 😂
i feel like the previous video was funnier.
Stop Tommy you are not DanTDM
the way that i’m 14 and still understood Wilbur and Charlie’s references (and i know damn well i’m not the only one)
Literally 6 hour and you get 1 million viewers...you are famous man!!

7:54 PHILZA CHEATS
How to make a Tommyinnit video Step 1: download a stupid mod Step 2: create a stupid side quest Step 3: hire a speed runner
you could have used you boat on the ice its faster
20:26 Some are 12 men
I understood every reference made
I was in the forest.. well I hope you weren't. Vlogging
In these types of videos Phil is the only one taking it seriously lmao
Honestly its wild that i remember watching when tommy had around 100k followers and now its almost 7mil. Its pretty cool :)
*wilbur trying to make refrences we dont understand* *most of them being songs that got popular again and that I love*
“We finally beat a challenge” *as they win almost all the time*
"he went long and gone and he went wide and died"                                                              -Dr.Cicle

Wilbur: his fans are all 14 and that means they were born in 2006 Me: h o w did he know ._.
POV: You do not want to Tommy to become 18 years old...

The first time I get massive panic about black holes and I decide to watch a funny video to get over it and THIS
no one:  wilburs and charlie's text colour changing constantly back and fourth from green and purple
There is no Black Hole in Ba Sing Se

Bruh this is the most thrilling funniest video from tommy It was thrilling when they got on the stronghold
Tommy: we're getting closer to 7 million subscribers Dream: congratulations! Tommy: **hits 30 million before dream** Dream: And I took that personally.
18:48 PERSONA MUSIC
Idk much about the channel but it appears Tommy's editor likes persona 5 music  Good taste :]

20:00
Lol I'm younger than Tommy and I understood all of the things Willbur said
Them mourning charlie’s death while i’m still finishing the lyrics to “imma get a scholarship to kings college”
I knew all the songs they were singing 😑
will and charlie: *making references* me: *literally understanding all of them and singing along*  i was born 2004, i’m 16 :’)
I'm sorry it would of been funny if he appeared beside Tommy aid "stop you'll make me cry " then vanished again
everytime tommy uploads he just grows by a million subscribers man.
Persona music fits Philza perfectly.
Phil absolutely carrying is hilarious.
Watching this when it's 5 hours old.
would just like to tell wilbur and slimecicle that every song they sang, i , a 13 yr old, knew so.
the vaccum cleaner of the universe mod
I'm just very proud to say that I knew ever single one of those songs that might be because Im an old aphmau fan and I watched a ton of music ship videos but I still knew them
Sic Mundus Creatus Est
I hate your guts
Tommyinnit on streams: playing on dream smp and a shit ton of drama  Tommyinit on youtube: f u n n y   m o d
I don’t think you realize how hard I was trying to hold in my laughter so my mom didn’t think I was insane
big fan of the halo 3 music lol
I'm 14 and I perfectly understood all of Charlie's and Wilbur's references
Remember Tommy is gonna install Tinder when he gets to 10 mil
Wilbur and slimecicle: lets do something Tommy’s fans won’t understand *starts singing songs*  Me: huh WAIT *STARTS AGGRESSIVELY SINGING*
Fun fact a black hole that is as heavy as the moon is microscope
“I called to the stars and they laughed at me.”
And peggy.
I love how Wilbur and Cicle are running for their lives and having some dramatic scene, and then Tommy and Philza are just joking around about trousers.
the mod aint funny but them chatting about it is
Wait if I’m 14 am I not supposed to know all the songs Wilbur and Charlie were singing?

you cant say 'whats something tommys fans wont get' then sing toxic by britney spears like 70% of us were phans at some point or another
Black hole: I’m a circle! Nobody:
I watch your vids but I am a girl is that a normal thing? I am on my brother's old phone because he have a new phone.
Surely I can’t be the only one who isn’t 14, 16 or 18 and vibed to those songs....
Everyone doing something  Phil: Ima just use creative
That is very funny  British man
Tommy at the beginning of editing: I'll censor bad words! Two seconds later: Nahhhh
https://youtu.be/bWLgA4jUkuw
7:06 That's backwards Latin. When translated it literally says "English sentence that is true in latin" (Damnationem latine hoc est verum latine) You are welcome.
I actually got all the references that Wilbur and Charlie sang
I was just watching one of tubbos tekkit from a while ago, very chilled out, relaxing. I came to watch this video and I was like "holy- omg ur energy is a little too high for rn"
I will be giving 2 million dollars to the person that gets in this black hole!!
Tommy: installs a crazy mod PhilZa: *just wants to play the game*
20:05 I love how ominous the black hole was in the thunder!!
Wilbur: *singing "Tik Tok by kesha*  Me, a college student nostalgia simp: YES, nothing beats early 2010s pop music
all tommy innit posts: minecrafts:__________________ mod is _________ funny
This is fuckin' bigger black hole ever I see
Boooooooring
Do they really think I don’t get those music references
theres something existential about their struggle to beat the game before being C O N S U M E D and even when they succeed they still inevitably return to the void
You all failed I know all of the songs
bruh if he keeps at the pace hes at right now. hes probably going to be at 10 million subs in a couple months wow.
He started the video with 6.63M subs and he ended it with 6.64M.
Now next mod will.be wither mod
The thankful pajama emotionally head because married especially kill amid a acid men. slimy, dizzy vase
Lol wilbur turned on creative in 21:24
They missed a great opportunity for a ghostbur cameo
request fundy datapack or mod cursed difficulty
when they said that we were all fourteen and made references they thought we wouldn't understand im pretty sure everyone that is 14 got it or maybe i just have good parents
My Favorite Jetpack Joyride Jetpack Was The Golden Rainbow Jetpack
19:33 gimme a sec to get 3600 thropy
Slime HeHe  Lmfaooo im dying
They Messed Up
Wilbur and Charlie underestimated my knowledge of early 2000s songs because I understood all of the references._.
Look closely at wilburs cam near a lake he spawns inna minecart
Anyone else see how they went in to creative mode every so often?
They just didn’t pray to mr beast hard enough
Them about to die by black hole   His friends who just vibin and playing clash royal
That’s waist she said
I’m 14 an d I knew all of Charlie and wilburs references besides the first one
*Always make me laugh*
Bruh I was in rec room on vr and someone said dream or Tommyinit and I said Tommyinit and I guy told me to die in a hole
5:32 ah yes were gonna ignore that tommy died huh and how he tped to slime...  And Phil going into creative mode at 7:53 XD  Ah yes and after slime died he had a diamond sword and iron pick and food XD yea I'm not buying it 9:33  Let's not forget about tommy doing /locate to find the fortress XD 14:23

I have more trophys than wilbur in clash royale
Ha
Charlie and tommy and wilbur relaxing  Philza:breaking records on speedruns
wilbur: “i’ve seen into the blackened eye of the event horizon, there is no screams. I called to the stars and they laughed at me.” tommy: “do you wanna shoot hoops with us?”
Did philza go into creative?
“I’m approaching 4-5 meters” “Is that normal?” “That’s about 15 feet” “Is that normal?”
They did some "Mining of camera in this video." (Reference to the Tommy/Dan stream)
I like his Phil us the only person who actually wants to win the game
wilbur i got those references :(
OH WAIT IT CIRCLE
when wilbur sees The Void and starts going a bit mad: ah shit, here we go again
It's the video we did not want but it's the video we god damn deserve
Everyone getting sucked up by the black hole  Phil: I’m getting ready to kill the ender dragon!
Tbh the 2000’s songs were bangers
Nice mode
Original titles
Who else watched Phil’s stream and knew something like this was coming bc he talked about how he was recording with Tommy and was just waiting for him to post... me too
Tommys inner lore came out for this one
I love tommy
is it bad I knew all those songs
0:16 hmm schlatt is in everyone's recommended tab
him using will power from P5 as one of the background songs was cool lol
4:46 😂
The Just Cause 3 background fighting moment
Tommys videos never miss. these are so funny and the rest of the group makes it even better!!
Can't believe Professor Soot forgot to wear protection
“He was like a brother to me” STOP TOMMY, YOURE GONNA MAKE WILBUR FUCKING CRY
I understood all of Wilbur's references
I love how Tommy always chooses the best epic music. Which I mean Halo music.
IN THIS VIDEO WE CODED IT SO THAT WILBUR MEETS F***ING GOD
"set Philza's mode to creative mode"
Wilbur and Charlie: let's sing songs that 14 year olds have never heard of  Then they proceed to sing some of the most famous songs of the 2000s   Me: that's Ageism in action right there 👆
He is just 100 k subs less from the cursed number....
me seeing the title and thinking of tubbo  V O I D
I was in the forest I was just finding tasty mud                                                      -tommmy 2021
Bro please bring dream smp vids please
Now Tommy has upgraded his pc with ryzen 9 and rtx 3090

Hmm i like how wilbur singing daftpunk stuff
Lol discord accept my friend request
14:10 IF I GET SUCKED IN
20:06 THATS FROM A FROM A HORROR MOVIE
I love the references of 2000-10s. Gosh I am old.
I love how they say "let's say references Tommy's child audience won't understand." Continues to sing songs that 10 year olds could recognize
the editing on these videos is always so cool, it never fails to impress me
Dude kids that are 5 know those references talk to Phil ask him like 1970 references then you be good
4:46 i was very confused on who was talking
can’t believe MrBeast was the staple of this video
Tommy just recently hitting 6mil subs: nice  Me: huh?  Me hitting 10 subs: yes.  Me uploading black hole mod vid getting 7 views: REEEEEEEEEE HOW???
Wow Wilbur be playing Clash Royale while there's a massive black hole about to consume them lmao I just love when I heard the Mini P.E.K.K.A said “PANCAKES” xD
fun fact: smaller black holes are stronger than big black holes
🤣🤣
Uh hi.....my sister and her friends have the biggest crush on u they just told me so I looked u up Bc they said u are famous so here I am telling the world my sister and her friends have the biggest crush on u LOL
The fact wilbur actually thought I didn’t understand what he was saying😭✋
Let's get Mr.Beast to comment on this video
Tommy: it's like were moon walking Slimesical: he he-ah ah
6:15 The funniest moment this entire video, requires context though
Hehe, they don't know 'I AM THE EYE IN THE SKY LOOKING AT YOUUUUUUU I CAN READ YOUR MIND'
Wilbur: Quietly playing games on his phone Black Hole : I'm gonna do whats called a pro gamer move
"*if* the black hole keeps coming towards me, then I will get very long and *die*"
20:37 What song was he singing? Sounds super familiar but I can't put my finger on it
Sience = dark hole of death black hoke
Your right under pokemon go on gaming trending
The thing is I’m 13 and know all of the songs Wilbur and dr.cicle r skning
Why dose philza have stacks and stacks of gold???
Wilbur "Lets make references the viewers wont understand"  Me a teenager who grew up with those references
PISS PANTS???!! XD
XD
this mod is very funny.
I love how they think that we wouldn’t understand any of the songs they were singing I’m 13 and I knew ever one of them.
ha
9:02 smh he missed the opportunity to say 5 minutes craft
#dunkeydolphin
"I called to the stars and they laughed at me" is such a raw freaking line and it's from *this*
If tommy gives me a shout out I'll sub him from my Moms phone Dads phone  Sister phone Brothers phone  My 6other accounts My 23 cuz phone My 19 friends phone My friends 3 sisters phone My PC  My laptop My other cuz Last my 4 tablet I prommiss

Kids channel grew faster than Dreams.
7:55 a reference to chilling Adventures of Sabrine S4
thinking about making more email accounts to sub to tommyinnit
“They say those that can’t do... teach”  Turns out someone likes School Of Rock
Wilbur really underestimates the culture of Tommy's fan base,,,, *TICK TOCK ON THE CLOCK BUT THE PARTY DONT STOP OH WO AH OH AH OH OH AH*
I thought he said you can’t unsubscribe anytime
Hello
20:57 TOMMY SAID WE GOTTA WUN DID ANYONE NOTICE THAT
Will you didn't confuse me I knew all those songs
"It's red and HOT"   heaven sounds like fun
Geez he gained 3 mil in 4 months
This is how the whole Super Smah Brothers Brawl characters felt during the subspace explosions in the subspace emissary
20:07  me when hw 😔
This video was noice
Hi
Charlie and Wilbur is the comedy duo I need in my life.
wait till MrBeast  sees this video and he bought them all to hell.
Not gonna lie, MrBeast would be very proud of this video
Man they had to hit me with jetpack joyride and clash of clan references
ha jokes on you I know the references!
I wanted to say tommy you make me smile every time I watch your vids same  to slimeCicle , phill and wilbur you all make me smile when I’m sad and I’m watching this video at 4:00 am because I love your videos and carry on with them 💜
The first thing in the video:  Hey Charlie, how do you wanna die?     Yeah pretty much sums up his videos
Wilbur got that season pass tho
me have spaz
charlie and wilbur role play while tommy and phil beat the game 😭
Nearest fortress.... ehy did he use cheats
Pog
If wilbur doesn’t go crazy on one of tommy’s videos it means the video hasn’t ended yet
You know you know everything is funny when tommyinnit
Disclaimer: mr beast was not harmed in the video 😂😂
20:36  Jokes on you Wilbur ik that song-
They call me white hole innit.  Lol
Tommy,Wilbur,Slimesicle: That’s my level nine Ice wizard for ya Phil: *dream speed run music*
Was wiblur in training areana cause he won clash royale 3 clown lol
honestly i just prefer quackity over slimesicle
Didnt he just hit like 6M like 2 weeks ago hold upp
Tommy: Intense stressful music | Charlie and Wilbur: Weird spacey music/silly music | Philza: Persona 5
21:29   *cue dramatic epic fighting music*
Tommy really does see Phil as his dad "Phiiiilll I don't like black holes" "Phil I'm getting pulled" "Ohh Phil I got golden trousers :D" "PHIIILL HELPP"
Willbur summon cuz of this 10:08  Willbur : /gamemode 1to /gamemode 0 xD
I'm glad that I understood Wilbur and Charlie's references
POGCHAMP
0:56 I thought he was gonna say “I was in the forest just looking for some likes”
You know, with graduation coming up in a few months I've been super stressed. But all my stress just melts away when I watch these videos. It's hard to explain but they're just really funny.
Wilbur: what will 14 year olds not understand 🤔 Also Wilbur: *sings some of the most popular songs ever*
How are these people so funny
Black hole sun, won't you come ?
14:10 IF I get sucked in,
The fact that they think 14 year olds don’t know Toxic is such a millennial thing
“We don’t need logic when we have science” -Me 2021
Istg if tommyinnit reached 10 mil people will find a way to cancel him
14:25 IDK MAN KINDA /LOCATE LOL
What a nice place like puberty never ends it sounds like heaven
Lmao 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Everytime tommy does a youtube video... Phil speedruns it EVERYTIME
I think during phils time in the neather there is persona 5 music in the back
i love that they all just cheat so obviously in these videos and barely put in an effort to hide it
**An English sentence that is truth, that translates to TODAY WE FILLED A POOL-**
Why was Phil set to creative mode at 7:56 ?
I love the intro when Tommy says Wilbert because Wilbert is getting sucked into the black hole
I won.  *dies*
19:33 wilber was letering was playing clash royal lol
They should do a video on clash of clans
Opens link:  *DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO*
I like how philza is about to die a fast and possibly a very painful death and Tommy is just laughing in the thumbnail
yes, being spaghettified by a black hole is the funniest thing ever LOL
clickbait thumbnails and titles, meh videos are entertaining at least
6:17
Hello
Ya know, I'm beginning to think that maybe it's not the mods that are incredibly funny
Anyone else notice that they kept setting their game mode to creative?
Here before 7 Mill
I want a pet Black Hole now, and I wanna name it ✨ Clementine ✨
Most people here are here before 7 million including me
Hype music = Halo music

The ominous lighting struck showing the black hole  20:07
Did Tommy just/locate fortress?at 14:24
You charlie and wilbur riding a boat and philza is having fun lol
"I'm so long~" -Charlie Slimecicle, 2021.
This is the cannon way willbur becomes ghostbur
charlie having a doctors degree is terrifying
me who is 14 and knows every referance..ahhaahaha
Imagine mr.beast watching this
20:33 i know this reference and im was born in the 2007...🤣
If anyone’s wondering, the backwards Latin sentences at 7:10 translate roughly to  “This is a Latin sentence” “This is also Latin”
yo your on number 2 on trending for gameing wooooo
these videos make me so happy
Wilbur and Charlie Thinking We Wont Know The Songs:  Me: *knowing all the songs*
"Go speak to Karl Jacobs Bi*ch"  -Tommyinnit
Actually I'm 12
minecart mods exist Tommy: "its free real estate "
I know the song it is tik tok by kesha I lessened to it when I was 8
I like how Ph1lza always gets diamonds at the start
You gained .2 million subs in less than 5 hours. Good job xd
Tommy is back 👌
I feel like Tommy finds Ph1lZa as a father figure.
Who compressed a whole star in that tiny space so there a black whole formed?
me a 14 year old tommyinnit fan vibin to all my favorite childhood songs wilbur and charlie are saying are too old:
I’m 14 and I knew allll the songs so haha Wilbur and Slimesicle
Some 16, some 18 me:11

Charlie are so amazing at comedy. Every line out of his mouth is so funny.
9:02 you should of said 5 minutes craft would of been ha h funny
14:24 ctrl D didn't came in clutch
fun fact: a real black hole the size of the one at the beginning of this video would destroy the entire planet :)
16:38 LMAO
Hey guys did you hear about how another youtuber made slimecicle and Wilbur’s game from the lava episode, and it’s an actual game you can play, it’s called chesticuffs
For the record, I don’t like boys. This one though,
Tommy Be Playing Nostalgic Music It's From Just Cause 3
Tommy’s Account is growing like dream istg
Are we all just gonna pretend we didn't see [TommyInnnit: Set Ph1lza's gamemode to Creative] in the chat
Bruh your camera quality went from 16p to 2160p
Tommy: Most of my veiwers are 14, 17, 18 and older me:11 BALLIN And getting the hamilton referance
What Wilbur actually said when he spoke latin ACTUALLY translates to: English sentence that is true in Latin
decoding what these comments mean before i watch the video is like trying to reading hieroglyphs
them: what’s a reference they won’t understand? what are they 14? me a 14 year old knowing every song: 😐
নাই
Tommy:I found something,bad. Wilbur: OH NO IF YOU FOUND A HOT LADY SHES SO UNLUCKY
You fool, Wilbur, I _understood_ that reference!
hi
Im 15 and i know all The referênces will and Charlie  made
The persona music came out of nowhere
Wait, does Slimecicle actually have a PHD or was he joking?
"With the taste of your lips I'm on a riiiiide"    *Jokes on you Wilbur, I'm 18 and I know the reference*
Any one saw Tommy set philza's gamemode to creative????
Slimcicle and Wilbur: Let's make references his fans won't understand cuz they're all 14! Me age 15: *knows all the songs they're singing*
I can't believe that a 16 year old has 5 million subs he is set for life
"I've not seen it at this size. "  Thats what she said.
Tommy became a scientist
#2 on trending for gaming yay!
hahaHAHAHAHHA VERY FUNNNYYY
Mmmmmmm suck
Phil literally awakened a persona in a palace if you think of the nether as the meta verse and nether fortresses + Bastions as palaces he just awakened his phase one persona, eye of ender

" Willbur it's okay , I'm friends with mrbeast "  _ Tommyinnit 2021
Who went to the comments to see if Mr beast commented
1:25 XD
Aye bitch boy notice videos
Wilbur and Slimecicle: ah yes the 14 year olds wont understand these references  Me, a 14 year old: **or so you thought**
At this point Phil should just make a separate series of him wondering off and playing the game by himself... Wait...
What if you wanted to go to hell But Mr beast said *today we filled a pool with 3 million orbeez*
Dude that black hole get dem speed
To all the 14 year olds talking about how they know the songs in the video: I'm going to punt you directly into the sun.
Tommy and Charlie: being sucked into black hole  Charlie: it’s okay set your render distance to 2 Tommy: oh look we’re okay Me: ahhh denial a concept I am quite familiar with
You All Can See How To Destroy Bedrock You Just Need This Mod To Destroy Bedrock
I'm in my preteens so Wilbur is dumb for not listening to you Tommy
I like how everyone's just dying and Phil is just tryna beat the game.
well dr.cicle, considering we learned some stuff about black holes two weeks ago...this would’ve been very helpful at the time
Racist Hole
i said that willbur was going to die and i just said that when he got traped in the black hole
POV: u noticed there isnt a tommyinnit vid without the word "funny" in it.
Everyone except philza: AAAAAAH Philza: *Yes lets goo 16*

the latin translates to "english sentence that is true in latin" according to google
Heads up at 14:10 the subtitles mess up
Nobody: The chat: *wilbur soot fell out of the world*

Alternate title: Charlie and Wilbur become science majors
Bruh what was that music at the beginning
Ok but Wilbur said that I wouldn’t know the lyrics to the song goes feelin a little bit tipsy and I do so I want to ask you Wilbur can you type the whole Declaration of Independence cause I can.         The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.—That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, —That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.—Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.  He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.  He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.  He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.  He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.  He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.  He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.  He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.  He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.  He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.  He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.  He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.  He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.  He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:  For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:  For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:  For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:  For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:  For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:  For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences  For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:  For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:  For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.  He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.  He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.  He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.  He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.  He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.  In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.  Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.  We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

im ten and i know all of the songs wilbur and slime were singing 🤣  that just shows how much time i spend listening to songs. 🤣👌
science is weird
Tommy: we finally beat a challenge  14:23: **Nether fortress cords are **_______****
Bold of you to assume I don't sing Kesha songs as a 2004 kid, lol 20:58 is my absolute favorite part
So much roasting
Blep
Nice to see that Tommy found something to do while stuck in prison with Dream.
I love how phil is the only person who treats things semi-seriously
"some are 16 some are 18" and some are 11
7:08 "damnationem latine hoc est verum latine" means "English sentence that is true in Latin"
wait one minute, did tommy say "just looking for some tasty mud"? tommy you good man???      the time stamp btw: 0:54
Has anyone else just been loving Charlie in these videos!?😂🤣
Bruh didn’t you hit 6 million like last video??
ManCraft

7:56 philza mining off cam
When Tommy couldn’t see the black hole where was it where was it where is the black hole and then lightning was like I’m gonna end this man’s whole career
18:09 *PERSONA*
I legit think I cried a little when I saw chickens in a hole (because they will die)(good thing)
Jesus is king
Uhm guys im in the. Future and in 2 months you in 7M

Mod
No one:   Tommy when it cuts to him at 5:09: WELL, IF I JUST TELL THE BLACKHOLE I'M ON TINDER-
Philza: changes gamemode to creative
Wy are you not going back to the server tommy?
Where is quackity ?
no one: charlie : he he *dies
"He went long then he was gone" "He went wide then he died" Charlie, Slimecicle, Slmccl, Dr. Cicle - 2021
Wilbur and or slime always have a moment together 😭
me being 13 and knowing every song wilbur is singing 🧍🏾‍♀️
jokes on you fuckers, i'm 16 and i got that hamilton reference >:)
let the old man rest
i like how everryone uses cmds to experiment and philza just: HMM, WHY CAN'T I HAVE 3 STACKS OF GOLD?
What boomers see whenever you use your phone in public for “too long”: 19:01
HAPPY TOMMYINNIT DAY
.
These are my favorite videos hands down
Okay, they need to understand that I get all their references at the age of 16. 20:27
hole in one
Yeah boyyyyyyyy it is so amazing and funny I love it
Finely a new video pog
Me being a 11year old and understanding the songs they were singing
We just gonna ignore how badass it was when they went into the end RIGHT before the black hole consumed it?
Tommy uploaded poggerschanpion
Tommy: looks at black hole “I can’t even see it”  Lightning clashes and lights up the black hole Tommy: *Screams* Me: that’s some Stranger Things shit there
Slime: I'ma going in a hole. Me:* on the floor about to pass out from laughing.*
tommy and slime: about to lose everything because of the black hole and their impending doom all at once  wilbur, playing clash royal: *i won :D*
In that black hole I sense something very old... Mule
Is innit your bed my child
Wilbur- "Let's say somethings 14 year olds dont know"  -Sings songs every 14 year old knows-
22:05 charlie sets his gamemode to creative felas
20:33 Wilbur underestimating gay culture
We just didn’t pray to MrBeast hard enough
Is it ✨Clementine✨?
It would be pretty poggers if Mr beast commented on this. Make it happen community
11:47 Tommy’s mic peaking is perfect for this clip
Hey Tommyinnit you not play many time pls play the dream smp
We have to get tommy to 7 mil by the end of 2021
charlie’s smile is so wholesome 😭

Slime: How many feet are you—  **realization**  How many meters are you?
He is so close to 6.69 M sub
I'd pay for a whole playlist of Charlie and Wilbur singing 2000 - 2010 songs !
I as a 22 year old tommy fan, can proudly say I understood the references 😂😂😂
The video was posted 4 hours ago and it's already top 2 on gaming
*kettle laugh mode*

22,567 commenter! ✌️
Philza’s back must be ACHING!!
#2 on trending let’s fucking goooooooo
7:56 i love how you can just see tommy turning philzas gamemode to creative lol
Any other 15 year olds like me got every reference that Wilbur and Charlie did?
Wilbur: What will Tommy's audience not understand. Proceeds to sing every single one of my favorite songs as a child
19:11 and 21:26 is my fav part
English sentence that is true in Latin
i appreciate Charlie’s reference to jrwi lmao
now I want to become an assistant to Charlie and Wilbur’s experiments 👁👄👁
i understood all of the references they made
Phil is the only one who actually plays the game normally
i know im not the only one who saw Phil enter creative mode lol
charlie thinking tommyinnit and wilbursoot fans wont know the "eliza" reference.. sir
How do people find tommy funny im not a hater  ut i didnt even smile
Imagine selling your soul to mr beast also
Wilbur: “what’s the most obscure reference we can make that his fans wont understand”  -me singing along to the songs he’s referencing 😂”
I am Fourteen and understood every single reference wilbur and dr cicle made
WOW.  That, DEFINITELY, is the most intense mod video ending to exist on Tommy's channel for a long time.
bruh willbur becomes so sinister in these
No one:  Middle school girls when they see a bee: 15:14
"What's h3II  like?" "It's white and relaxing"
As someome who has found salvation inside the infinite empty blackness of the void, I can confrim that MrBeast is actually a pretty cool dude.
Youdidntuploadonfridayyouliar
Loved the mobile game references can’t believe he plays clash Royale lmao
Bruhhhhhh the songs Wilbur and Charlie were singing hit me w a lot of nostalgia holy shit
I’m 15 and I got every reference because my parents raised me right lol :)
Legit only started watching tommy because he was in a slimecicle video now hes one of my favorites
"Let's make references that Tommy's fans won't understand"  Me, an intellectual;;     aNd PeGgY
“I see a what the fuck” hmm never knew that was a thing
Asian: I'm asian so i must like math  Tommyinnit: There is a mod                          so it is the                          Funniest mod                          ever.
How many meters- ITS CENTIMETERS
PhilzA just casually sets his game mode to creative 7:49
"PHIL WE GOTTA WUN" lol babyinnit
Include tubbo so you wont be jealous
He got more subs then techy
apparently MrBeast is the dark lord of hell
wilbur and charlie expect us not to know the songs theyre singing and then here i am catjammin
e
Am I the only one that saw Tommy do     /locate fortress when they got in the nether
“I’m ah-going in a blackhole”
I'm finally early ish
I’m ten years old but I love ur content
2002 BTICH
jokes on you Wilbur I am 20 year old Tommy innit fan and stronger by kanye west is in my top 2 songs
I love how blatant they just slip in and out of creative, and use commands to locate structures. It's not about the gameplay and entirely about to comedic situations. I love it
I like how tommy used cheats to locate the fortress
19:33
Wilbur in a boat pog
I like how he says the 14 year olds won’t understand but I’m 13 and am smarter than them
every times he uploads his 1 million subscribers are increasing , anyway you are the best and  funniest youtuber i have ever seen
how many feet- oh wait british boy, how many meters?  CHARLIE ONLY THE US USES FEET AND INCHES AND WHAT NOT HELP
I forgot jetpack joyride existed-

You are funny then the blackhole
Wilber: wants to look at the stars Black hole: NOPE
I know all the songs Wilbur and Slimesicle were singing and I'm 13
I’m 14 and new every song they talked about
Whos gonna tell Wilbur that none of those references were that old....... I mean I'm almost 17 and I was singing along man lol
It’s is round and massive
Wilbur, you going insane in every video is getting old....
22:32 the moment tommy was glad that he beat the game and forgot in the overworld still has that Black hole. press F guys :'D
HOW DOES TOMMYS SUBCOUNT SCARE ME SO MUCH EVERY TIME I SEE IT
im 14 and i got most of their song references. what is my life?
When is the storytime finale coming out??
Bruh tommy put phil in creative
"Tommy's fans are all 14 years old"  Me, the same age as Tommy and get all the reference they said:
I’ve been having a bad day but this just made it better
They should’ve went to the nether
There is so much halo music XD
7:08 Damnationem latine Hoc est verum latine Google translate is garbage but with my two years of Latin, I’m assuming “Damnation in Latin This is real Latin”
More of these vids plz 😎
..
POG
Wait tubbo is in the thumbnail, but no tubbo.. **ClickBait**
Haha Wilbur I know all those songs 😏✌🏻
The contrast from calm music and boating to intense nether trading with sick persona music is amazing
GO SPEAK TO KARL JACOBS
14:25 nice cheats loser
Alternate title: 3 brits and a murican get the big succ
The only thing bad about the black hole is that it’s not a square
OMG how did Wilbur now my age edit: and yup no idea what happened next
The persona music fits so well
This proves Tommy's vids are the best since there are a million views on the day it's posted
nobody:  charlie and wilbur singing tick tock while they die
"Lets make obscure references that no 14 yo will understand"  *starts singing the songs 14yo grew up with*
Tommy says he beat a challenge but he used a command in the nether to find the fortrest
oh so it was today
You was wrong I am 12
What will Tommy’s fans not get? *proceeds to sing stuff from or childhood*
Im glad I found tommyinits channel in 2019
Hey tommy make more videos on dream smp or a idea "make your own server and invite dream,techno,tubbo,sapnap,Big q and not found  If you like my comment plz like it

7:51 bottom left corner😐
Who’s going to tell Wilbur that people born in 2004 know the song toxic
7:53 [TommyInnit: Set Ph1LzA's game mode to Creative Mode]
It should be 2005-2008😅
Meanwhile: PHILZA just doing his business
7:55 LMAO not Tommy setting Phil to creative
I thought mrbeast commented

I hope you all have a good day
Congress on 2# trending
POGG
All jokes aside 13:37 hit different, Will and Charlie’s acting abilities (even outside the smp) are just 🥰 Also, 20:04 that scream tho
You need to stop telling them what the mod is and just let them figure it out on their own 😂
since dream's birthday is in August 12, SAME AS MINE,  we should unsubscribe Tommy's channel "ANYTIME" during the day of August 12  it would be kinda pog
If u hav seven mil than go to a red hole
7:56 Tommy sets phils game mode to  creative 10:06 Wilbur sets his game mode to survival
COME ON DOWN AND BUY SOME CORN OR WE WILL SACRIFICE YOUR NEWBORN AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
without philza they wouldn't even have a chance
Wilbur: what are some obscure references we can make that the fourteen year olds won't understand? Me, fifteen, knowing every song they sing: *hol up*
phil: actually playing wil and charlie: *OH YOU WANNA LAY AN EGG SO BAD*
Bully dantdm one more time I swear to God.
Another case of “Phil tries to beat the game while the others go off”
i like the fact that wilbur thinks 14 year olds don’t like kanye
h e l l o
ok honestly though this would be such a good horror movie
THIS IS MUCH MORE INTENSE THAN THE MANHUNTS
“You struck a deal with the beast” omfg 😂😂👍
why ppl disliking this 😩, to be honest this videos cheer me up, and I hope u will have good mood after watching this video 🕴
Oog-

Me born in 2009 knowing all the songs *sips cola*
10:54 Bases while building a base LMOA ME FUNNY ik its not a base ()
TOMMY NICE NUMBER 2 ON GAMING
The fact I was born late 2006 and I sung along with wilbur and Charlie is funny to me
I watched this at night and nearly got caught because I was laughing so hard.
wilbur trying to make references that we wouldn't understand but manages to sing every song from my childhood. honestly wilbur, do you think so little of me that I wouldn't know toxic by britney spears
I’m 12 and I know the songs Charlie and Wilbur where singing
i appreciate wilbur and charlie's interactions, theyre always funny
Pleases stop swearing
I want you to pass dream's subs
Charlie trying to be funny Not funny Funny
i understood the songs wilber started singing
Tommyinnit makes our day
Will and charlie: *making references they think we won't understand* Me: (12) *dining along XD
Tommy is using a just cause 3 soundtrack
“We should do basketball, and, and, drugs.”  *famous last words before destruction*
The whole video in a nutshell is Charlie, Tommy, and Wilbur just running from the black hole and philza just chillin in the nether
Give this man sub
I clicked without hesitation... Still late tho...
So whos gonna tell tommy that the dragons a woman-
I'm 13 and understand all the references
Pogchamp
17:26 persona 5 music pog
I’m 12 and I understand every reference Wilbur makes
When Charlie asked about the tutorial I was waiting for tommy to say “5 minute shacks”
20:06 was beautiful
Some are 11 Years old
Did anyone else notice that he set philza gamemode to creative
Here before 10 mil
All the songs Wilbur sung I knew all of them and I’m 13.
These became 10 times funnier with Charlie's puns and ridiculously funny comments
wilbur: tommy's fans are 14  Me: I am 20 but thanks for thinking i am a teenager
Just casually teleport and go to spectator mode in 5:33. The only thing left is that phill goes to creative, O WAIT
7:51 Tommy set Phil to Creative? not hate, just wanted to say it ig
I like how in this one there was no effort to cover the cheating. It’s nostalgic in a weird way.
No one: TommyInnit: let’s do basketball and drugs
Yayy guys we r alive🕴, new Tommy’s video
charlie hitting the "tiiiippsyyy" as he got flung into a black hole and died was the funniest shit
9:00 prolly Ghost Ninja
Hello enchanted piss pants
Hello tom
Wait #2 trending for gaming? Nice job
watching phil completely beat the game singlehandedly is always a joy to watch
21:25 this part is awesome
“Wilbur soot”  His last words were......  “DONT STOP”
7:52 lol
Tommy keep it up I hope you get 7 million subscribers soon

I like how Philza is the only one who takes it seiriously
i love how in all the mod videos phil is playing and trying to beat the game while the others just fuck around
I’m 14 born in 2006 knew every song they sung😐 love the video tho
“All of tommy fans are 14” Me: 14 ( ._.)
Tommy’s growing faster that bamboo
Some are 9 like me
8:11 you cracked the code and the egg LMAO ME FUNNY
I wish I had a physics teacher like them 😭😂
POV: you tryna search comments of Wilbur say Aww Tommy🥺 when tommy said he was like brother to me

I'm surprised how tommy survived that blackhole moving at light speed
E
Wow
Today is my birthday!!!
Hello as a actual 14-year-old viewer of tummies I would just like to say I knew every reference that Wilbur and Charlie made. :)
Why did YouTube censor my password? **************
Cant believe wilbur thought we didnt know toxic, shame
I made the one I'm using
whatcthe fuck im 12
I can make anime profiles if anybody wants one
I love tommy and everyone in the video but I just hate that this is all just scripted.
Tommy looked up the nearest nether fortress ;-;
7:54 me looks at chat: hmm normal
I really wish Tommy could upload some videos related to the Dream SMP...
I will never understand how Wilbur manages to start a cult in every single one of these.
DID ANYONE NOTICED THE PERSONA 5 MUSIC PLAYING WHEN IT CUTS TO PHILZA BY HIMSELF IN THE NETHER WHERE ARE MY PERSONA 5 FANS AT
"IVE SPOT THA WITH MY EARSSSSS" - Tommyinnit
i’m 14 and i know the lyrics to TiK ToK better than they do
The halo music was amazing
No one is going to talk about the cod music lol
Tommy's editor used persona music.      Huh.
Start of the video and it's immediately a talk about death. Seems normal.
some of tommys fans are 9
Tommy: stressing over the black hole Will and charlie: singing hamilton and katy perry songs
Fufdduduudduud
this video has too many quotes that can be taken wayyy out of context lmao
Why do you have random laughing thumbnails?
I’m excited to see tommy to get to 7mil subs. Subscribe to tommyinnit!
My mom is older than philza and I’m taller than my mom.....and I’m 8....
“I SPOTTED THAT WITH MY EARS” ajhdidbdjsbs im dead

title of the video: tommy in a black hole while philza speedrunning
TIPPPPSSYY DONT STOP MAKE IT POP DJ BLOW MY SPEAKERS UP TONIGHT IMMA FIGHT TILL WE SEE THE SUNLIGHT TIK TOCK ON THE CLOCK BUT THE PARTY DONT STOP NO OH OH OH WOAHHH
ngl, I would prefer if someone other than Philza was in these videos, cause he’s not really funny
Bruh I'm 14 and got all the references Charlie and Will were making
I'm starting to think that TommyInnit is just doing Dream's old challenges but just doesn't even try to beat the game.
theres a joke there somewhere
I’ve been listening to Kesha songs a lot lately for some reason and then I’m watching Tommy’s new video and I hear Wilber and Charlie singing tik tok. 😂😂
and to the people that say tommy is annoying he is not my sister is the worst
Do a data pack!
"Now die, die for science... Goodbye wilbur soot!" -Dr. Slimecicle

I love that the Latin translation of what Wilbur was saying is “English sentence that is true in Latin”
11:26 PEOPLE CHANGE LIKE THE TIDES IN THE OCEAN
"Clementine" P.S. not all tommy's fans are 14 im one of the younger ones im 12
Tommyinnit says : Not all my subscribers are 14 some are 16 some are 18-  Me : I'm 13
tommy about to close the sub gap between him and vik
Super Mario Galaxy goodness
When Wilbur and Slime were singing.... they underestimate our knowledge of songs.
5:00 male chickens are roosters not male chickens
14:10 pretty sure charlie isn't saying what the subtitles are saying.
*Poggers*
last time I checked you were at 3 mil-
Tommy thinking of a title in his mod vids: this mod is funny, well that was difficult.
This is funny.
Ok
Ok soo . . . i may or may not thought you said 7 Billion and it took me a moment to realize that is in fact not correct
will: speaking some kind of alien language    me: *he lost his mind, hasn't he?*
Omg yes video idea, tommy downloads tinder illegally
Slimesicle: ELIZA Me: AND PEGGY!!!!!
7:54 hmmmmm chat says something
Wilbur: let's make jokes Tommy's fans wont understand   Me: *14 and knows all of them *

This just makes my day better
No offense but quakity Makes these video way funnier
Tommy beat this mod  Dream: he is the chosen one
Didn't dream did this with George and sapnap
14:10 Charlies text box wont change, lol
The handy fur opportunely cheer because ghana joly crawl before a female fertile line. adamant, capricious sociology
After slime said something about mac and cheese I got a commercial about it
Ha I knew all the references òwó
20:06 thats terrifying
(Not) first ment
i almost thought he was going to say... WE ARE GETTING CLOSE TO 7 SUBSCRIBERS
We love you tommy! :D
9:22  Don’t say that, he will cry
Wilbur singing old early 2000s songs and expecting tommy fans not to know them—... *he knows a lot of us were probably born in the 2000s right?? And that a lot of us are british and british songs play on the radio for like 3x as long as theyre popular for*
Wow
At 7:53 Philza gets put in creative
Me reads the title: How is a black hole funny? When watching vid: oh.....
Why does he not link the place where he gets his mods from
1:24 made me laugh so hard
no one tell them that a 13 year old got all the references- then again i was born in the wrong generation so
this wont get pinned
This has to be one of the videos tommy has made.
17:26 Ah so I see you are customer to the way of the persona
hwhhwhw w
he went wide and then he died
Im 14 and got all those refrences
Im 11 and understand these memes

mr beast and karl watching this video AIHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
Funny thing is I'm actually 14 and I knew every song Wilbur was singing.
isnt this like... what dream did?
Jk
I have a problem
Fun fact, black holes don’t suck. They pull as much as a sun.
6.9 mil is coming tommy
*[tommyinnit: set Ph1lza’s game mode to creative]*  Well, that’s one way to defy getting turned into spaghetti by a black hole
I just realized every video like this, Wilbur and Charlie always run off and do some wierd stuff
Is it true that dream died
Yay I'm not late
Im 13 and i understand the reference wilbur and charlie made qwq
if you back in time and find yourself, you will call yourself big T ?
Funny haha
lol im 13 and got all the references
Secret text at 7:08 is “English sentence This is true in Latin” And also no bots at my comment or I drop kick you
Yeap
Most the references Charlie and Wilbur made I understood lol, and that’s on being raised like I was born before the 2000’s 😂
9:21 he wasn’t there to say “don’t say that, I’ll cry” 🥺
Them: they’re all 14 Me: *an eleven year old understanding all the references*
I love the halo music playing at the end
every one of these videos wilbur acts psychotic every time😂
i was born 2006 and i only knew like 2 of the references they said
POV: you came to the comments to look for Mr Beasts comment
I got every reference and I hate it
Y e e t
tommy: when i get 10 mil subs, i will install tinder.... illegally  oh boy be safe out there man
Hi
tommy im loving the videos but theyre getting a little repetitive. i feel like a shit ton of people agree too. they are really funny though
i like how these videos are just "tommy, will, and slime do weird shit while phil is being productive"
love how they just openly cheat in these
I freakin love Wilbur and Charlie's bits
Tommy: Did you know there’s a black hole behind us Philza: 16 Ender pearls fuck yeah whooooo
20:30  Jokes on yall I'm 15 and know that song You're toxic, I'm slippin under
tommy: AAAAAHHHHH *GOGOGOGO/GOGOGOGOGO/*  wilbur and charlie: 🎶imma get a scholarship to kings college🎶
When the lighting struck and they could see it 😱
Nobody: Phil: Creative 7:50
Wilbur and Charlie making old jokes Me: laughing because I get what they mean by then Kids who were born 2011: what?

Wario on drugs 8:22
The halo reference...how chief and Charlie got left behind. The portal closed without themmm....cinematic poety
Hey just subbed man ye I did find you annoying at first BUT JESUS UR FREAKING HILARIOUS POOOOOÓOGGG

Will: Sayings Some Deep Stuff  Tommy: Wanna Shoot Some Hoops With Us
Why is there so many verified people in Tommy's comment section lol
U should do size mod again
hey Tommy boy, I suggest using thesaurus.com for the word 'funny'.
More British tommy please not being British it is fuckin funny
Tommy's videos always make me happy 😊
Number 2 on trending for gaming let’s gooooo!!!!!!
As someone born in 2005 I would like to mention i know all of the songs that Wilbur and Charlie were singing and it was rather funny.
All the times I coudlve said that’s what she said...
Anyone realised the subtitle error?
Funny things is I’m 12 and Wilbur and Charlie  we’re making quotes and I understood them I understood the song and the skylar sisters song
LMAO PHILZA LITERALLY BEATING THE GAME AND THEN CUTTING TO THE REST OF THEM BEING STUPID IS SO FUNNY-
I'm 14 and i understood all the references wilbur and charlie made
some are 10
wilbur really thought us young'uns wouldn't get the brittany spears reference smh edit: AND THE KANYE
When your 13 and you knew each one of those references
I has unsubbed now it was the end of the video
I do basketball and drugs and beat up nerds
Comedy.
I love when Wilbur discovers something he acts as if he’s seen the birth of the universe itself
English sentence that is true in latin
mr beat watching this:   :0
The fact Wilbur thought we would know none of those songs and yet I’ve just turned 18 and at age 10, those were the best songs of that age for me.
“ How do you want to die? “ -its more like less of a question, and more of a threat -slimecicle2021
God there’s so many that’s what she said moments 💀
*British singing noises*
Gib subs
I rushed to go in yt and to find the clips about the dream smp where like dream and tommy is in prison i dunno but when i saw this vid i knew it would stop me from doing so lmao
yo the subtitles around 14:10 are messed up saying "IF get sucked in," instead of "guys I'm no long"  not big of deal though
The pointless maria consquentially confuse because part prominently disapprove during a incompetent religion. closed, dizzy format
Pov: u r reading my comment.
The fact that Wilbur thinks we don’t know those songs amazes me
Every time Wilbur has different plans going on 😭🙌🏻
Phil was just carrying everyone
Wilbur- what references can we make that tomy's fans wont understand Me understanding litteraly all of them and im 14-
Slime: "tell me what Mr. Beast said to you in hell" Wilbur: "udfjrnvuinsondiueriouvneig", which translates as "today we filled a pool with 3 million orbeez". HAHAHAHA
15:40 best part
lol 15 and I got all the references
I’m surprised they beat the challenge for once
Hmmm would you say it's the funniest mod ever?
Ironically I’m eating eggy
As a 14 yo tommy fan Ik everthing they sang
When tommy said the stuff about the tides in the ocean, it reminded me of Dreams song lmao
And they thought we wouldn’t get their references😂 dude I don’t like under a rock I’m 12 and I knew most of those
_Look at all those blocks getting sucked_ Tommyinnit -2021
I like how Charlie's subtitles were the color of Wilbur's for a solid ten seconds. Editor Larry is not doing as good as he used to.
"tounge"
You have more subs than technoblade now!!!!!
Lets get a pog for de black hole?!
5MIL UNTIL 7MIL!! YOU CAN MAKE IT TOMMY!
Wait is that Persona 5 music?
I see Tommy is getting really creative with his video title
Lol
Me: HA I UNDERSTAND THE REFERENCES DUMBASS  also me: older than 14... oh😀
3:33 can we just take a second to look at the fact the philza died form an iron golem
Tommy is being quite racist in this video
18:09 You cant fool me with piglins, I heard that persona 5 music. On a side note great vid lmao truly the funniest mc mod EVER XD
Tommy: Funniest mod ever 😐😐😐
Tommyinnit get more videosinnit
Wilbur and Charlie: let’s reference something Tommy’s fans won’t understand **starts singing**  Me 15: singing with them
being verified=free likes on your comment
Wilbur and Charlie really thought a reference Tommy’s audience wouldn’t understand was the undeniable classic that is Toxic by Britney Spears?
Tommyinnit: **Mod hole**  Me: **Flashbacks of Karmaland4**
something tommy’s fans will not get  me 14 and understand every thing they said 👁👄👁
Ok this was weird
HAHAHAHAHAHHA I GOT ALL THE REFRENCES THEY MADE
Wilbur: and they laughed at me Tommy: *WaNnA sHoOt HoOpS wItH uS*
b l a k  h o l e
HOW AM I LATE WTF
“Aww all my stuffs getting wet!” And then there’s Tommy who’s just there like: “oh it’s poring” in the most calmed, keel, monotone voice ever. He’s just so used to it, it’s still winter Esther here in England😂
George did this lol
Is there a drug mod?
the fact that I knew exactly what songs wilbur and charlie were singing and im 13-
Best youtuber ever!!!!
" obscure references " they say as if i didnt spend all my time listening to those songs in the car and playing just dance as a kid
Tommy : U CAN UNSUBSCRIBE ANYTIME  Other people : unsubscribes  Me : Bruh😂
Him you can unsubscribe any time  Me yeah keep telling yourself that 😜
*hears persona 5 music when phil is trading with piglins*
14:09 Editing mistake lol.
20:34 — 20:46  Im 11 I got all of those references
Bold of Wilbur and Charlie to assume that 2006 children are uncultured
This was indeed very funny
at this point, every damn mod will be funny if tommy makes a vid with it
"I called to the stars and they laughed at me"
Hey haven’t ya’ll noticed that he had the same face for most of these videos before you click it wonder how long it takes to make that face
Imagine tommy when he's 24
tommy calls for phil as if he was calling for his dad     i mean he is but...
I’m 13 and got all of those music references
Best vid ever
Some of us 2006 were brought up right 🤚😪
Bruh the halo 3 music was so unexpected
This song is from Hamilton 20:44 "Eliza and Peggy"
Bill Nye the science guy SCIENCE COOL
I knew all those song references... I’m 12  especially Hamilton!!!!!!!
And like normal will is the only one defeating the game
Tommy is gonna get 10M subs before 2022
You can just tell that Wilbur was in drama class as a kid ✋😭
okay now i want to see the tornado mod and gravity mod
Do a nuclear mod
Can't wait for Techno to be in one of Tommy's funniest mod videos
will: **dies** charlie: *tells everyone** tommy: he wa slike brother to me i can just here will yelling "i will cry tommy"
Tommy probably puts subtitles on his videos because he knows that people have to turn their volume down so their parents can't hear all the swears lol
Is no one going to say something about the halo theme playing in the back round
Look almost 6.65m ha almost 666
Wilbur is so into role play.
Yes tommy
Wilbur is always destined to start a country/start a cult/become Ghostbur
Wilbur and charlie trying to make a reference we wont understand Me a 14 year old: doNt stOp mAke iT pOPp
Is anybody gonna tell philza why he is in creative mode
Tommy used to be funny
i love how charlie is just a part of da gang now
Look I’m ea- *Sees 21,000 comments*
Tommy: *some are 16, some are 18* Me: *but im 10 and a half and a quarter.....eh i dont give a fock i swear either way i love this content so fuck age*
i cant stop luaghing
I've been noodled before. Its fun. Try it. One of us. One of us. One of us.
I didn’t see Wilbur and Charlie go to creative what are you talking about
Very Funny Video, Thanks
TOMMY! CONGRATS! You're about to hit 7 million subscribers!!
he's getting too powerful, first 6.65 million subs, and now the power to summon blackholes at will.
I remember when Tommy only had 300k and because he joins the dream smp he got a major uprise in subs

Yuh
"all of tommys fans are 14"   me:  *laughs in 12 year old *
*”GO SPEAK TO KARL JACOBS BITCH FUCK YOU”* TOMMY NO😭
21:18 that perfectly cut scream was hilarious
Ph1lza was slain by Iron Golem
20:05 Why is no one talking about how amazing that was?
The hole : i have come to eat every thing Tommy : FLY
Till you believe
Tommyinnit: "Phil i have more time because im young." idk why but that made me laugh so hard
"we gotta wun" xd
"I can't even see it-" cue dramatic lightning
Best parts here in my opinion: 4:19 - 5:09 13:14 - 14:02 19:57 - 20:10 21:23 - 22:55

22:39 They beat the tnt challenge too
Wilbur playing clash royale
best youtuber yes
This video was a rollercoaster of emotions for me
Wilber whats your friend code
i could hear jc3 music in the background
The Plot To All These Videos: Wilbur goes mentally insane, drags in Charlie, meanwhile Tommy and Phil do most of the work only for Tommy to fall in the wrong crowd fucking around with Wilbur and Charlie whilst Phil continues his duties as a father as Tommy eventually rejoins Phil and beats the game
In space no one can hear you scream
who Noticed philll never died then when he did he set to spectator? hardcore reference?
Mr beast seeing this 👁👄👁
Damn at least credit dream
i am pesto
Am I the only one who noticed the modern warfare and just cause 3 sound tracks?

14:10  uh oh, typo
At 20:09 I just died at his high pitched scream 😂👏
I bet the next video will be about the Origins mod.
The Ouroboros cycle....
Tommy when you were thinking of the name of the black hole you said my name Terrance
Tell wilber I'm 13 and understood all of his references
20:05 Action
tommy i beg of you stop eating mud
wilbur be like:i won the clash royale
YOU CAN UNSUBSCRIBE ANYTIME😀

Not trying to brag but im 14 and knew ALL the references, try harder /j
Charlie: "Mr. Beast is the Lord of Hell"
imagine iif mr beast actully saw this
he got long and then he was gone He went wide and then he died   *mhm spit some more bars*
"Let's make an obscure reference that Tommy's fans won't understand!"  Me: "DONT STOP, MAKE IT POP, DJ BLOW MY SPEAKERS UP. TONIGHT, I'M ALRIGHT TILL WE SEE THE SUN-LIGHT!"
Charlie's last words: "he-he" 1:19

everyone messing around. meanwhile phil is speedrunning
Tommy: *WE GOTTA WUN* wilbur and Charlie singing
3:05 they are getting pulled that far away
the lets roll with it it was short but lmao it was so funny
Charlie: Wilbur’s *dead!* Everyone else: Oh no! Anyway
Anyone else notice that tommy has only posted videos on mods
So....how come i was born after 2006 and understood nearly all of Wilbur and Charlie’s references
Wilbur went inside the forbidden hole so many times jeez
love how you can see them just blatantly cheating. also as an astrophysics major, everything you guys said was painfully hilariously super wrong. loved it <3
Tommy is prob gonna surpass pewds and tseries in 1 year
the constant stream of tommy's videos with his mouth open mod is very funny
tbh, tommy videos kinda getting boring, just the same title with "funny" makes my interest to 28%
tommy is a side characyer in his own videos. will and charlie are the main characters
Tommyinnit is making more views than pewdiepie bruh  Pewdiepie last video got 900k view and the other 3 million and Tommy 6,8,4 million oof
Funny.
21:49 was genuinely like a movie scene dude
7:08 the captions translate to ‘an english sentence that is true in latin’. you’re welcome.
hi
tommy we are all 14 😐
Who else saw tommy use a command to find the nearest fortress
will power slaps, use more persona songs please
Black Ball
Sucks to *suck*
Didn’t the Dream team already do this?
Black hole
"Did you call mr beast the lord of hell" um idk about that dude
Me being 13 understanding all of the references I am not supposed to understand
“Not all are 14, some are 16, some are 18.” Me, 12 and gets all the references: oh
Tommy says wun
*IMMA GET A SCHOLARSHIP TO KINGS COLLEGE*

This is it, my final observation!" -12:40 "It's the great omelette of the beyond, come take a bite, Philza!" -14:30 "I got sucked into a black hole and at the end of the world, there was a great white void." -15:30

OMFG THE FIRST TIME WILBUR DOSENT SAY BACK "...Don't day that I . Will . Cry . " 9:21 BJSJSJDBSNNSNDNDNW MY MIND IS JUST DHSJDJJDJSJD
I love it that every video Phil is trying to get diamonds
My favorite quotes in this vid  "Tommy it's trying to hoist me by the bootstrap!" "Phil Im the golden boy not piss-pants, they didnt call me piss pants in school-"  "He went long, and now he's gone!" "I SPOTTED IT WITH MY EARS" "I've made more trousers and theyre not even *guccay*"
I'm 14 and I knew what wilbur was singing, that toxic song and what doesnt kill me makes me stronger
16:48 flex pc
Im 15 20:33 and I got both references, mainly because my mom used to play them in the car all the time. I also got 21:09.
I’m 16 and I love those songs, those were my favorites growing up
Every videos the kids are going more and more crazyly funny and there is philza that just farm. ;w; i like them so much dud.
We definitely need fanart of Professor Soot and Dr. Cicle now
Alternative Title,  3 Idiots hinder a speedrunner while Tommyinnit forgets to flush his very large all consuming poo.
*Who doesn't like H O L E S ?*
Bruh

Black hole is black
“So Wilbur’s dead!” Tommy: Oh no! Anyway..
“I SPOTTED THAT WITH MY EARS” Ok Tommy....I don’t think that’s how ears work but ok

21:23 look in chat #cheater
Big fan here tommy
This video made me way too stressed
I can't believe quackity is not in this vid 😢
This was so funny
lol i just watched my dad scroll past this video on the tv
18:45 I recognize persona 5 music anywhere
I’m having a poopoo month thank you for curing my depression Tommy
i hope Wilbur knows that 2006 babies know all of those songs💀
I like how Tommy tries to censor his cuss words at the beginning then just gives up
Next year.                                           Tommy: We’re getting close to 200 mil so if you enjoy please sub (even tho I make 30 mil a vid) MOST PEOPLE FIND ME ANOYSJD SO IFB YOU CANT JDUFA SUBFJSRICE
These please me
I’m 13 bruh
I like how they're making fun of the fact that every mod video Tommy makes has "funny" or "funniest" in the title.
Daft punk Kesha and Britney Spears won’t go over 2000 kid’s heads lmfao, but it was hella funny seeing y’all sing tick toc
Mr. Beast: The Herobrine of the Nether
Is it just me or did Wilbur and Charlie's texts switch colors
mr beast burger LMAO
i need more philza badass compilations
Bold to you assume we 14 years old don't get these references
Ayyyyyyyyy POGBOII!
21:29 Oooh THIS IS GETTING INTENSE I LOVE THIS

“I’m in the forest looking for some tasty mud.” -Tommyinnit 2021
I like tommy illnit
Im going to commit manslaughter
I swear literally every video the channels sub cout goes up insanely
I'm 13 and I got all of the song references that Wilbur and Charlie were making
Try again wilbur I understood all those references as I am a man of culture
You know Wilbur and Tommy have almost nothing in common but they still make good friends
POGCHAMP
Your toxic I’m going under
Tommy used /locate but idc since its still hilarious
Its weird watching Tommy cause I'm older than him
‘lets sing something his fans wont understand’ proceeds to sing the most popular songs of the late 2000s
Congrats to tommy for getting 6 million subs. It felt like yesterday when he barely reached 3 million
I understood all of the the references Wilbur and Charlie made. They underestimate us😂
Wilbur and Slime: "Lets make references that Tommy's 14 year old fans won't get."  Me, a 20 year old woman who's humor just happens to be the same as a 16 year old boy: "Aight bet."
I am old for I knew all the songs referenced by the old men
6:19 I see wilbur's character shades around his face and now I see that as a smile and now I can't unsee that
Tommy, I understand I am commenting this at 2:30am but why did you post at 12am😂🤚
Just Halo battle music in the background
emoji form: 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️                          🖤
Wilbur always died because the world spawn is in the black hole
Is the black hole like a child predator or something.
George, Dream, and Quakity off solving mystery’s while Tommy, Wilbur, Slime are off chilling with a black hole and spilling their hearts out to it. Phil a on the other hand playing hardcore like always 👍🏻
Philza is the only one that ever tries to beat the game in these videos LOL
i may be 14 but i was born in the uk so i understood everything
Tommy over here like so stressed out and Wilbur is just playing clash royale like bruh stop 🤣😆🤣
understood all refrences and i am 13
Subscribe to tommyinnit
all thee seeds have village
Everything is funny with tommy
14:10  Editor Larry explain?
3:32 philza actually died? What?
We’re gonna disregard when Philz’s went into creative mode huh
when they sing Britney Spears I vibe and I'm 14, thanks mom for being the best mom and showing me the best songs
I accidentally clicked this video and I don’t regret a thing lol
im so glad slimecicle became apart of the group
I'm the dragon's fan!       Her 𝓞𝓷𝓵𝔂 𝓯𝓪𝓷
We need Tommy, Phil, Wilbur, Charlie and Quackity in the same video imagine the chaos
Black hole equals M E G A S U C K
Imagine having init in your name
Tommy and Charlie sims the best songs of my generation
Well Tommy has an Rtx 3090 card...
Why were the songs Charlie and Wilbur sang so easy to know but I’m not even like 22 there age????
1:24 Smooth Black hole
2 hours ago this was posted now I’m here at 2:30AM watching this.
Past videos titles: Very funny Stupidly funny Hilarious Actually funny Very funny
16:04-16:34 just cause 3 intensifies
In 50 years : I added the people are bigger mod in real life
Im fat
I just want to say that the editor did a fucking amazing job on the final segment with the halo music
"What's the black hole's name? Is it Clementine or is it *T E R R A N C E* ?"
Devil works hard but the editor works harder
Sad moment:after Tommy watch black hole come to stronghold,Tommy and friends panicking and hurry up to enderworld but they lost 1 of them is charlie, Charlie has down,Wilbur down by Enderman,and only left is Tommy and phil,  Joke ending:they fall hole ground because no ground to land
Wilbur: refers that Tommy's views wouldn't get Me: HELL YEA
This has gotta be one of, if not my absolute favorite of the bunch so far!
“Well if I just tell the black hole that I’m on tinder”
I love how everyones messing around and Phil's beating the game
9:22 wilbur didnt say that he was gonna cry when tommy said that :O
I watched another black hole vid on dream
Yout doing this because in dream smp there was a problem and your stuck Good your having fun love your vids keep up the good work
Is it weird that I knew all the references
“With a taste of your lips I’m on a ride” They really thought we wouldn’t know Britney Spears.
2:34 racist    btw its a joke
Tommy: i can’t even see it- *lightning strikes  Tommy: *screams like a little girl 20:07
Is it me or has Tommy's face gotten progressively more wide over time.
I know All of the referance
Mw 2019 background music
20:05 that lightning was PERFECT timing!
Honestly, I never recall a more terrifying challenge than this.
Lol 😆
Tommy quick question  Is the title what brings views or the fact that people know what the vid will be cause of Title
tommy 6.9m is better then 7m buddy
can u link the where to download the mod?
congrats for 7 m its advance
Nobody  Not one soul  Wilbur: *wheezes of pain*
I've been waiting
My whole face the entire time: 👁💧👄👁
17:27 the persona music spooked me
Ive heard all the songs that wilbur and slime sang
On 7:08 it says: damnationem hoc est verum latine  It means This sentence is true in Latin
Did anyone realize the color of wilbur and slime’s captions switched for a minute and switched back? Or did i get messed up? 4:47 it switched i think 5:00 switched back lol
As a 14 year old Tommy innit viewer, I understood 90% of the obscure references
E  let's see how many likes would i get current:0
Tommy I sub to u on twitch
Bro that was so close I thought they was freakin dead 21:48
Tommy dont act like i didnt just see "the nearest fortress is at ......"  hmmmmm when you entered the nether
is that cuphead music i spy
So are we all just gonna ignore that tommy used /locate to find a fortress
3:32 "Ph1lza was slain by iron golem" lmao
Wait. Tommy didnt get 6 mil on this video? Hol up.
Soo everyone saw in the chat at around 14:24 that tommy had the nether fortress coordinates in chat right?
Lets get 7m subs! Tommy Gang!
"hehe- OH OW OH OHHH-"
this mod is what happens when you abuse your power in universe sandbox 2 ngl
i just love that they stopped caring to hide their cheating lmao
There should have been a surprise ending where the black hole explodes and tommy's pc breaks.
I really hope MrBeast doesn’t see or comment on this
Tommy: you can unsubscribe any time. Me : thinks  Also me : I will never unsubscribe
Why the frigg does wilbur and Charlie always start a secret organization
Epic Moment 21:25   Omg that was Close 21:50
I know I can make a joke about this if I think hard enough
Uh so like no hate but if u look in the chat at 5:38 its says he put his own game survival
Can we just appreciate that in this videos phil is the only one actually beating the game
14:25 shows a cheater
Literally every tommyinit’s vids: Minecraft’s *name* mod is very funny/hilarious
Wilbur:All fans of Tommy was 14 Me:10 years old
Does anyone else recognize this music 16:30.
Shroud
As a child born in 2006 I can tell you I got all those references.
Claim your before 1 mil views here
Pentagon hexagon youplanetgone
The halo music at the end fitted very moistly
Ever wonder why custom names is everywhere on youtube saw him on koneko and a bunch of other channels
I prefer other black holes
THE FACTOR EVERY SONG CHARLIE AND WILBUR SUNG I KNEW AND IS ON NOSTALGIA PLAYLIST
I didn't even finished the video Wth is happening
You are soo so so so soooo annoying, you are irritating
Tommy: "panicking" PHIL COME BACK NOW   me an Intellectual: laughs in subspace bubble
I knew all of there references -
5:51 LOL🤣🤣
the scene with wilber and dr.cycle and when dr.cycles jumps into the black hole it sounds straight out of a thriler movie  13:35
I bet at the end it will be teh size of yo mama
every time charlie and wiblur are in the same room it’s like throwing a dart at a board made of hell
Tommy is right, youtube unsubscribe you, I just checked and I wasn't subscribed, when I already was.
I understood all their references and I started singing with them when they were singing Hamilton . I’m only 12 too.
I’m going to lose my marbles if Mr. Beast actually comments on this video
Philza doing all the work lol 😆
Say water bottle at the start of your vids
The mod is not funny the people are
5:20 tommyinnit: wilburr whats heaven like? willbur:its red and hot philza: oh jesus, that doesnt sound like heaven  funniest
And im 11

Tommy: not all of my viewers are 18 wilbur, they could be 14, 15, 16...   Me who is 12: 👁️👄👁️

“Im going to get ten-million subscribers and install tinder illegally”   —TommyInnit 2k21
The "PHIL! JUUUMP!" was so good.
i dont mean to be a dick but tommy and phil cheated look at 7:55
Wilbur and Slimecicle: Makes obscure references. Me being 14 and I know them

Do you ever Wonder who the first person to comment is
the ending was actually amazing omg
TOMMY
I love toxic by bbritney sp
DUDE IT LOOKS LIKE A MOVIE.  20:06
poggers
I have to say, this content is really getting stale. I mean it was funny at first, but now it's like someone who just keeps doing your face jokes. That may not be relatable for everyone, but it is for me.
Tommyinit is the best  And Sub to Tommyinit to get 10 Million subscribe 😮
Philza>>>>>>>
they literally used /locate fortress
TOMMY DO PREMIERES!!!
damn i swear it was just yesterday you were saying "guys we are so close to 6million subscribers!" your growing at lighting speen tommy :)

"Im toxic you're going under"

7:55 why is Phill in gamemode creative?
PERSONA MUSIC POGGG
I was doing homework but got 'pulled in'  by this vid : D
“All of Tommy’s fans are 14” Me who’s 20: 👁👄👁  I hate to admit it but Tommy is *sigh* funny
TOMMYINNIT DAY
Charlie being MJ: 1:21 - 1:27
wait no joke me and my friend melissa were literally talking about how we wanted to die so when i saw the intro i was shocked XD
NOOOOO WAY 7MILLLL
Imagine Mr Beast commenting on this
Nearly every episode, Phil is always the one getting the stuff. He's literally a dad to these guys
3hours late thats fine
Lol Wilbur Play Clash Royal   And i think he pro 19:32
I love ur vids
WERE IS BIG Q !!!!
22:32 no one gonna talk about how Philza betrayered tommy and killed the ender dragon himself?
the entrance to the end felt like exactly like halo 3s warthog run
When Wilbur said "English Sentence That Is True In Latin" in Latin, it was epic.
there not even trying to hide there cheating anymore
PHIL DOSE ALL THE WORK EVER TIME
S p a g h e t t i f i c a t i o n  (Deleted comment I spotted.)
am i the only person who saw thet phil went in creative mode-?
20:33
When you realize the only time Phil died to the black hole was at the end
YEET UR DELETE TO BLACK HOLE HAHAHAH
How many subs can I get off of this one comment? Oh wait, nobody cares so stop writing fucking comments like the start of this
Tommy is now my favorite mods guy 👌
What if tommy innt got 6.9 million subscribers? What will he do?
Did he say mob or mod
Wilbur thinking he'll confuse us me who's 13 and gets them :😎👍
Tommy wilbur and Charlie are slowly going to the base and Phil is in the nether
Uploaf moar
LMAO I love how Wil and Charlie just sang a lot of 2000s hits. It makes me wanna be a kid again qwq
My dads that black hole, because he’s not existing 🥲
Also where getting close to 7 subscribers
I love this but could we have big q back
headcanon that the egg going into the black hole created the dream smp egg
Wait. Has tommy been using the same laughing picture in every Funnies video so far?
Everything they say is sus
why is there cod warzone music playing near the end
"Eliza~"  aHem.      *And in the distance, you can hear the elegant calls of a great mass of Hamiltrash as they all chant "And Peggy" in perfect unison* Such a beautiful sight.
i wonder when tommy is going to stop to do this yee yee ass thumbnails
hey im 8 im born in 2012
0:54 when slimecicle says, his subtitle change to purple  edit: in 1:06 it comes back to green
14:25   when the black hole be too stressful, so u use a command to find the nearest fortress xD
Wilbur sir .. stop.. wilbur dont bring the gen x into tommyint its already hell on the smp
wilbur: lets make references that tommys fans wont understand   me at 12 knowing them and singing along
i feel personally attacked by the assumption that i (a tommyinnit viewer) don’t know all the words to Toxic and TiK ToK
The three jokers: lets get back to phil safe from this rescue mission Phil: nah i got im good,
I love how Wilbur made a lot of clash references, one of my favorite games and i think its very underrated
i like how charlie and wilbur tried to make references that tommy’s fans wouldnt understand and i understand all of them AKDNDOEN
HOLD UP- WHY DOES HIS HAIR LOOK LIKE ITS BROWN
Bruh this channel is so dead all he's uploading is his "funny" videos
What a black hole would really do is go to the center of the The planet while everything above it collapsing on itself to close the whole the black hole is made and then it goes spinning inside of a planet While collapsing in on itself so basically if you look at it if it was 2D it will look like a big circle getting bigger is it spins around the black hole does not leave a tunnel wherever it goes so basically that’s what I’m trying to say or you could just explain it like this Black hole + Earth = death lol
We should trash into it for romance and drama
Pissy innit
19:32 No one:   Wilbur: *I won*
Tommy cheated
Holy crap when they were in the end fortress that actually scared me how much they escaped by
*"What's heaven like?"* *"Its red and hot"*  *o k*
Literally new all the songs Charlie and Wilbur sang, I’m 14
wilbur this episode was literally just,,, that guy in those two episodes in s2 of doctor who. satan's pit or smth
im 12 and understood all those refrences
Tommy: *literally running for his life and screaming hysterically*  Charlie and Wilbur: *IMMA GET A SCHOLARSHIP TO KINGS COLLEGE*
20:35: Brittany Spears- Toxic 20:37: Kanye West- Stronger (I think because Wilber did a certain stutter that sounded similar to this song)
They won but at what cost
willbur: sacraficing his life for science  charlie: being a doctor phil:playing the game tommy: sHaKiN’
Charlie: that was the funiest slow painful death ive ever seen! me: wtf?
Some are 9
20:26 I knew all of the references he made. I’m 14
I think that's a bbh
Phiza mincraft most said word - FUCK - me BRUH
Tommy has taught me ne swear words
tomby
10 mil by april 1st make it happen
Wilbur:Lets reference something really obscure that tommy's fans won't understand! Also Wilbur:*proceeds to reference hamilton and some of the most known songs of the last 20 years*
Tommy: finds the blackhole Wilbur soot More like wilbur sucked
Nobody:  Charlie: casually sings Hamilton
hey man, very offended, i am not 14. i am 16. 😔
Here before 1mill views.
14:24 We definitely didn't see Tommy type a command to find a fortress.                                                     🤔🤔
I love that Wilbur and Charlie are the most chaotic one in Tommy's video
WAIT... Where is the "Most people finding me annoying"???
"Wilbur and Charlie fuck around while Philza beats the game" would be a better title
Im I the only one that new the song references wilbur made and am under 14.
Very Funny, Stupidly Funny, Actualy Funny, Hilarious, Repeat.
Wilbur:DONT STOP me: *make it pop*
Wilbur: *Dies*  Charlie: That was the best slow death I've even seen  Me: Wait, what?
Epic
He got wide and then he died
waht
20:05 Now THATS a true horror moment
Pog
Highkey wants the obscure references bit Charlie and Will made uncut
i think one of the songs wilbur sang was hamilton
"Let's do something really obscure that Tommy's fans won't understand"  *Sings Toxic by Britney Spears*
:( Nobody is talking about the Halo 3 Warthog theme in the video
ELIZAAAA
17:26 did Tommy just use... Persona 5 music?
10M?!?!?!?
“Male chickens don’t lay eggs”  Anyone else think of Unus Annus?
“BLACK*Hole*
I love how Phil and Tommy actually try to progress and Wilbur and Dr. Cicle  just mess around. It makes the video so much more funny!
Wilbur and Charlie singing Tik Tok is the best moment by far.
I have not subed to tommy that's how good he is
Click bait I thought your videos were going to be good 🤣🤣Your videos are terrible
HOW DOES THIS CHANNEL GROW SO MUCH, SO FAST let’s get to 10 million
When you’ve seen this done 3000 times
WAKE UP IN THE MORNING FEELIN' LIKE P DIDDY
charlie and wilbur: lets say things that tommyinnit fans wont understand starts singing songs that i know: welp guess i cant be 14 no more-
what’s the song playing in tommy’s pov at 17:53/18:17?
Like the Mario music
i think tommy invested in a synonym dictionary
who wishes that  tommy does videos like his old ones instead of all of these  mods
CHEATS 14:24
Tommyinnit: says that alot of people find him annoying but hes almost at 7 MILLION Me: Wouldnt that make you ,A LIAR
i love it when tommy goes "PHILLL!
14:25 TommyInnit cheats lmao
I just wanna see how many of these titles he can make
"I was in the forest just lookin for some tasty mud"
congrats on 6.64M Subs TOMMY! #tommyiscool #tommyispog #tommyis_sexy #tommyishandsom
I just like how Tommy and Wilbur and Charlie fucks around when pilza was just helping the team
God I love the persona 5 boss music when philza was in the nether
Right when Wilbur said our lives are flitting police sirens went off :(
Some 11...
the way Tommy just looks at him has me cackling   (18:29)
7:08 I literally looked at this in my mirror, wrote it down, and google translated it only to find out that it says “English sentence that is true in Latin.” ✨d a m m i t✨
I subbed tommy
This was funny 😆
Tommy setting Phil's gamemode to creative
we're getting close to 7 million subscribers! *400k subscribers away*
‘Damnationem latine hoc est verum latine’ literally means “English sentence that is true in Latin”
He said 14 year old don't know those references I'm younger and I know those songs
They losing the shit of there mind bruh
14:25 when you use /locate
Therapist: circles in mincraft is not real it cant hurt you  Mincraft circles:
I love when Tommy gets too British for the captions
how long have you been using those headphones tommy?
Wilbur and Charlie were making song references me (a legitimate 14 year old) got immediately
18:50 That's the Persona 5 OST! YEAH
“Minecraft’s Survival Apes is so funny”
Lmao Wilbur attempts to make references that 14 yr Olds won't understand but it failed. - certified 14 year old
I love how phil is just beating the game while tommy and others are panicing
20 30 im 14 lol
The only thing better than tommy... is tommy and dream lol
umhi?
Wilbur and Charlie singing songs they think we don't know

The void wanted to thank tommy for giving it a emerald
YESS LOVE THESE VIDS

he screamed like a girl lol 20:06
I am 16 and got the reference 😂 Philza also be pulling the whole team
less than five seconds in and i already know its going to be chaotic
Me a 12 year old, triggered when tommy doesnt mention 12 year olds watchin him.
Early??
Phil: we need to lift more  Me: who was quite literally watching the February 26th P1lza stream whilst lifting. Hahaha
Wilbur and Charlie trying to make obscured references.  Me- I know all of these and trying sing along with out any one hearing me in the store
TommyInnt:set PhilZa's game mode to creative
5:31 nice cheating there BUD, he switched into survival implying he was in some other gamemode prior And it shows tommy in creative MODE
AN IF THEN STATEMENT
All of these videos sum up to Tommy, Wilbur, and whoever they're playing with screwing around while Philza does the work and I love it so much
Been here since 700k
Where’s tubbo
FUNNIEST
7:53 hmm
Is very funny
did you know 1 % of your viewers are acually 7 years OLD?!?!?!
Am I the only one that saw tommy locate the fortress cordinates
THE CHARLIE MICHAEL JACKSON BIT WAS THE FUNNIEST 😭😭🤚
You growing eyebrows .-.
Dream george and sapnap used this mod didnt they?
Wilbur: Let's make obscure references Tommy's fans won't understand. They're all 14. Me, twenty-one with a glass of wine in hand: Bruh...
The "BALLZ" EXPANDS!
3:41 the ground sus 0.0

Oooff
I love how the black hole is behind them and wilber fken playing clash royal god🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The fact that Wilbur guessed my age correctly is honestly impressive lol
Thank You
I loveyou!!!!
tommyinnit's thoughts of philza: *HE IS THE MESSIAH* Philza: *I AM NOT THE MESSIAH*
Why is every video very funny
*I understood all the references 👌*
I never knew Tommy was a fan of halo
21:30 it’s too funny not to point out
U copied dream
why did wilbur get lovecraft for a second
16:45 the amount of gold philza has    -_-
*Wilbur makes refrences he thinks that tommy's fans would not understand* *Me being 11 and knowing all the refrences ._.*
20:30 damn makin me feel old man
How to actually confuse us: 1. A song super surreal and probably wouldn't have been let listened to at a young age 2. old internet methods
fools I understood all the references between charlie and Wilbur and I am 18
The quality went brrr
Let’s go Tommy at it again with the best videos
I’m 11 and understand their references, accomplishments.
Your toxic I’m slipping under
Charlie was so funny this video I was laughing every bit
21:30 "ITS PULLING THE SNOW FROM ABOVE MY FEET!
i have found my inner tommyinnit
i like how tommy just. never explained the tindr idea. we'll never know what the hell he was even talking about
7:07 After I took screenshots and flipped them, it said: damnationem latine hoc est verum latine Which obviously is in a different language so I copied that into Google translate and it said: English sentence that is true in Latin Props to Editor Larry.
I watched this in the background as my D&D party died and my character sat below deck without a clue
When Tommy said terrence I thought he said terrence afton
Wilbur: “Male chickens don’t lay eggs.... why where you calling it a heeeeeeeee” *dies Charlie: *WHAT HAVE I DONE*
YO OMG I LOVE UR VIDEOS JHFS BJHZLBVJEKWNDLC/ V
Philza mode:creative 🤣
Every time I see tommyinits thumbnails actually any youtubers thumbnails I instantly think of David dobrik
E
Not tiktok by ke$ha and toxic by brittany spears
YEAHH! We’re just going to completely skip the fact that when Ph1lza was grinding in the nether, “Will Power” started playing-
wilbur: lets say something all of Tommys fans wont understand!  me:*singing along*
“Tommy’s fans are 16”  >me, who is 30, and is subscribed to all of the lads  Ha ha, yeah... 14...
Can you buy me a pc Mr TommyInnit? many thanks MrOxfiy (ps if you don’t reply you don’t love women...)

Tommy: we installed a funny mod! Wilbur & Slime: *weird rp* All 3: Where’s Phil?? Philza: oh I just got diamonds and stuff lol
Notice how he gained 10,000 subs in 3 hours. This man is impressive.
I was having a bad day and dude this made me laugh sooo much that I smiled a lot keep up the good work tommy.❤️👍
Everyone in the comments admitting that they are 14 and below makes me laugh
3:29 took me back to that one wizards of waverly place episode where they had to get the chicken to lay a golden egg
When will Tommy bring up the fact that he surpassed Technoblade in subs?
pov: loking for mr beasts dissapointment comment...
Just hi
18:27 JRWI Podcast?
Did Wilber and Charlie seriously think we don’t know those songs? I’m 14 and I grew up with those 😅
“He got long and then he was gone”  “He went wide and then he died”  -Slimy boi 2045
Tommy
It’s crazy how you played with techno and you are almost x2 his subs
Me knowing every song wilbur and slimesicle sang while being 15 made me question if I'm actually old
Bro tommy I saw that you used commands to find the fortress not very pogchamp

I remember  all the references that wil and slimecicle made
Phill playing real
Wilbur and Charlie: We gotta say stuff Tommy’s viewers won’t understand. **both start singing songs I know and love** Me: **sings along**
Ha jokes on you wilber soot I'm 13 and I know all of those songs.
Phil: How do you want to die? Me: I've already got my death planned out, I'm going to die by laughing so hard I end up choking to death
Tommy milking the cow known as mods
I love how wilbur always goes crazy in these videos it's always something about existentialism and becoming one with a mysterious force
Tommy playing fake
IS THAT A FUCKIN PERSONA REFERENCE
HES BACK POG
So very pog
Megoosta!!!
I like all the commands going off In the chat.
Gout.
My parents said if I get 1000 by the end of 2022 I will get a setup
me *realises that philza set his game to creative multiple times* also me: hmmmmmmmmmmmmm
All the references in this vid are so nice
"this is true in latin"
When the title doesn’t say the funniest mod ever :(
Yeess
I have never seen Tommy this stressed
🎵I’ma going into a black hole🎵 Charlie Slimcicle -2012
They win like half the time but everytime they win they go "we finally won". They finally did it. For the 6th time in a row. They finally did it.
People who like thinks tommy is a big man
why when you were in the nether why did you play the just cause 3 "the cops are on you music"
Why does wilbur always do dramatic
Im 14 and i only understood one of those references wil isn't wrong
For the fact the child got more subscribers than the adults POGGGG
Tommy: He was like a brother to me  Stop that Wilbur will cry.
Nice job Tommy, adding in the warthog run music with the end portal. Such an intense moment with fitting music to boot.
Your never too early but you can be late 😌
I stopped watching a woman for this video
Before 1 MI ganng
At least Wilbur won clash royale
just imagine quackity playing
Another job whell done
Wilbur: Does not give a fck about the blackhole  Charlie: Lost his mind Tommy: Wants tp finish the game but only helps at the End Philza: ABSOLITE BOSS
Is it just me or every time I see a mr beast video in here
Can you please not put funny in your titles anymore🤦
Pog
1:22 he  HE-HEEE’d a little to hard XD
Bruh i know Toxic almost word for word. HOW DARE YOU INSULT ME.
Because of tommy the dream smp sucks and you know why beacause you started a war for the stupid disc and why dream is in the prison the dream smp is for adults tommy... Just leave and create your own smp and its for child  -Big K
It's been a while since I've seen this mod
Wilbur: menoitannad enital coh tse murev enital Google: Latin damnation. This is true in Latin.
hey guys, i think this mod is funny
These video titles piss me off...
Great you’re almost at 7 million subscribers
When Tommy said “he was like a brother to me” I was desperately waiting for Wilbur to say in the distance: “Don’t say that I’m gunna cry, Tommy”
Its always up to phil to be productive while everyone is dead
It almost cursed number lol
Hey.. .  ......                                 *R*
Some are 14 some are 16 some are 18 in 11 :/
So as usual, Wilbur's fucking lost it.
Give your soul to mr. Beast Or Give your soul to Charlie d'emilio
we can unsub anytime? guys lets make him  go back to 3mil sub so techno pass him :DD           jk
i cannot believe that minecrafts black hole mod is very funny
Bruh 14:25 Tommy cheats to find the fortress
I’m 14 yet I know all the songs they where singing :/
lol
i see hes stopped saying: people find me really annoying, so if you dont pls subscribe. i found that really annoying.
Mr. Beast is canonically Satan
When tommy said some of my fans are 14 some are 16 some are 18 but what if one of us are 10 or 11 years old
How about channelnutpig
wilbur and charlie were tryna sing songs and make old mobile game references thinking no one who is under 16 would understand but im only 13 and i understood every single song and game they said
Oh he look hungy
I find you so fucking funny
I know all the songs they where singing and i was born in 2007
Jokes on you Wilbur I got the references
“By George I can’t believe they’ve done it!!!”
Wh wh wh what dont kill me makes me stronger brings back ds days
4:45 I think the editor messed up the colors for Charlie and Wilbur’s subtitles
I sub ( : (:
@Mr. Beast
COOL
I imagine this mod but in hardcore would be impossible.
“ I spotted that with my ears” tommyinnit 2021
I swear this kid was celebrating 4 mill a few weeks ago on Twitter, crazy what this kid has achieved
14:10 Larry/Tommy you forgot to subtitle this part correctly
Philsa always do the hard work And willbor he is out of his mind
Skittles
Flashbacks to when Dream, George, and Sapnap made that a plug-in. Fun times haha
Me:mmhmm  Tommy Crew: ima use cheats after I die Me: you’re not Minecrafters only Phil is a minecrafter because he didn’t use cheats
3:58 he said my username lol
im 14 and i understood all the references lmao
Some are 10
it is already apperent that Phil should always be on these playthroughs..
"Wilbur Soot set own gamemode to survival" Wilbur- GUYS
Tommy: “I’m being pulled” Slime: “Ok time to go!” also slime: *I can’t escape*
Does the schlong get long when you go wide and die?
I miss Quakity
No one:  Tommyinit: “I’m the golden boi! *Not piss pants!* ”
No one: Wilbur: 19:32 i won 👍
-we finally beat a challenge also them: nukes the ender dragon
This reminds me of dream's version
20:05 why does this gives me jurassic park vibes
We miss quackity in this vedio...
It seems like ever week in his intros he says: " We are close to hitting *insert a new number higher than the last* million"  And that's amazing! He's been popping off lately
The hole was so close to the portal
love how wilbur and charlie just failed to make references we didn't get
14:27 me pissing myself because i noticed tommy had an rtx 3090 lol
7:09 it said  “Damnationem latine hoc est verum latine” if you wanna know how put your screen to a mirror
Not gonna lie the last minute of the video was INTENSE
POGCHAMP
Is it really worth watching if it isn’t the funniest mod?
Tommy and Phil: playing the game Charlie and wilbur soot: vibing and being best friends
Slime: oh guys I’m so long oh  Editor:  puts if I get sucked in
Do 1 with tubbo
POV: ur scrolling through the comments to see if mr beast commented
This is probably the one time I’m not 5 months late to one of Tommy’s videos
Very proud of you tommy in 2 years you are almost at 7 million subs at the age of 16 congrats.
I can’t tell if Charlie meant the egg pun when saying “we cracked the code!”
SMILES TOO YOU!!! YOUR CHANNEL IS GROWING!!!
wilbur and charlie trying to sing songs that 14 years olds wouldn’t know  and me a 14 y/o just singing along with them
Its 3am in my country when I watch this, you uploaded this on 1am ;-;
Wilbur thinks we’ve never heard toxic?? Wat
I'm trying my hardest not to laugh at the fact that tommy screamed like a girl at 20:07
Me an 18 year old: *understand all of Wilbur’s references*: I possess forbidden knowledge lost to this world.
I Love How Wilbur Said This - 7:15 And When Philza Laugh - 7:16
Momento español

ANOTHERRRRRRRRR ME GUSTTTTTTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
0:55 I thought wilbur was speaking i was so confused when he showed slimecicle
14:11 ae wrong one
I was added on Discord by a man named Tommyinnit. I asked, are to fake, he invited me to a discord server that had 2 people on. So I knew he was fake, so I said, are you the real Tommy, he said yes. So I said, if you are the real Tommy, shout me out on your next video. And he blocked me...
Heyo ma peeps :3☺️
Are you kidding me wilbur. Toxic, Stronger, (I think American Boy) etc are classic pop songs and I’m 17 today haha. We’re not all uncultured <3
Amazing
Hi
the backwards letters at 7:08 translate from Latin to English as ''This is a sentence in Latin''
Jesus your getting famous REALLY FRICKING FAST
20:34 haha it's either I'm old or something but I know all of those songs
I used to have a Russian physics teacher and with his accent we had an entire lecture on “big black hoes”
Me being 15 and knowing every song Wilbur and Charlie sang :D
Ah the day maker
"he got long and then he was gone, he went wide and then he died"   HE BECAME OBTUSE AND THEN HE HUNG FROM THE NOOSE
I love watching Tommy he is so funny

Tommy: I cant see it   Thunder strikes*   Black hole: HERE I AM BITCH

Wilbur always manages to turn these things into role plays.
Phil:persona 5 intensify
“fuck this man”- tommyinnit
TOMMY IS GROWING SOOO FAST HE MIGT GET 10MILL BY JULY ON MY BIRTHDAY 🎉🎉

I haven't even watched this but I'm so glad it got posted, I have ptsd and I felt flashbacks coming on, but watching these videos really helps me, so I'm really glad a new one got posted.
look at chat 7:50
Every time i watch tommys video it increases for a milion
It’s sad that I’m 16 and got all the references that Wilbur and Charlie made
14:25 look at the chat
Booooooo we need quackity  Quackity=funnier  Funnier=MORE VIEWS
Wilbur and Dr.Cicle have made me feel old, dayum.
Lmao all these songs were my jams in middle school
No one: Tommy and Dr circle: slowly boating away from their impending doom. Wilbur playing games on his phone: I won!
i want the mod tommy

The funny thing is I'm 13 and knew all of their references lmao
As someone who is almost 14, still got all the references Wilbur and Charlie made. Nice
It is, lmao
19:02 as a scout this was funnier than it should've been
Anyone else see the “the nearest fortress is at (***)(***)(****)” when they entered the nether?
Get tommy to 10 million so he can install tinder

Wilbur: Let’s make references 14 year olds won’t understand Also Wilbur: sings toxic an iconic song from most 14 year olds childhood
Where girls cry: *titanic* Where gamers cry: *charles death in henry stickmin* Where boys cry: 21:48
19:16 that’s a pretty small black hole in comparison to real ones
Wilbur and Charlie is always onto something
Bold of Wilbur to assume I didn't grow up to 80's music.
14:24 Pause.   whats that at the bottom left corner tommy? hmm?    cheating i suppose!
Well I'm 12 years old
Was that a beast reference
Did anyone else hear the halo music in the background or was that just me?
Eliza and Peggy the Skylar sisters!
Im 10 lol
7:50 the halo is calling us
wilbur: the 14 year olds won’t know toxic me: you underestimate my gay culture
1:25 *Annie are you ok? Intensifies*
Before 1 mil view club
The black hole is the orphan Ben 10 main character? Lore

POGGG
“Waaaah!” - Wilbur soot 2021
"Whenever you feel useless, just remember that white pencils like me exist :)"  👉White Pencil
Why is no one talking about how mr beast is the ruler of hell? Honestly lmao
WILBUR KNOWS MY AGE 0_0
I think its time he should find something new these mods arent funny anymore
12:00 killed me NOT THE HYPOTHESIS
Tommy: wilbur was like a brother to me Me: i remember you saying *wilby*
No body Absolutely nobody  Phil goes full try hard to beat the game
WTF I just saw it as a 5 mil now its 6 and a  half????????

I love how on the side of the subscribe clip there is Jshaltt videos
my heart swelled when they mentioned jetpack joyride
why does every single Tommyinnit mod video result in Wilbur going insane and starting a cult
Hold on brb
Tommy please tell editor Larry that between 4:46 and 5:00 he got the colors for Slimecicle and Wilbur mixed up
I’m literally failing physics and here tommy is to save me 😂
21:25 epic chasing scene
7:52 Tommy set Philza to creative mode

Tommy is litterally innit (the black hole)
So philza isnt that amazing at getting stuff😂 I saw it said he went into creative😂
I’m 16 and for some reason I new all of the references
Why does tommy not have a diamond play button
When Tommy used Persona 5 music at that one point I was legit shocked. It was hilarious
Phil with the persona 5 music bartering        Time to take your pearls!
tommyinnit: *does something* also tommyinnit: funniest shit i've ever seen
Philza is the best here for me😂
5:33 theyre cheating?
1:21 this is how michael jackson died
Tommy cheating in his video confirmed 14:25
Bruh I'm 13 and even I got the references
Basketball and drugs lol
@tommyinnit I suggest you do one video that's just like this but hardcore and there's like 8 of you. Just a suggestion, it's optional.
W-was that blooming villain when Phil was killing the blaze
Philza in nether: tommy puts persona5 music
12:10 something tells me tommyinnit ran out of coke at 3am
Haha
Tommy’s last words. And I quote.                     *I- Fuck this Man.*
Tommyinnit video: 10/10 It has Persona 5 music: 11/10
This really was very funny! Not clickbait
The "if" "then" statements are killing me
this was just wow
bro that moment where it thundered and the blackhole was there that was scary
Much wow
:0
Infinite death loop    Korega.......requim......da
I love how they ain't even trying to hide that they're using cheats
Mr beast had no right be such a funny bit in this
I wasn't expecting Modern Warfare music
Yoooooooooooo watssss up my guy
5:02 “Male chickens don’t lay eggs... why did you call it heeæeæaeæ....” - Wilbur
Heyy
I love how tommy and them are never really focusing on beating the game when they try to beat the game
How is there always a village-
20:07 made my spine tingle
They didn't call me piss pants in school too
If Mr. Beast is the lord of hell who would be the lord of heaven?
my name is clementine 🥰
I'm so incredibly stressed after watching this video, but it was amazing let me watch it again
this was awesome, but i'm such a nerd that all i focused on was when phil was getting shit in the nether is was persona music playing lmaoooo
16:05 just cause 3 intensifies
Heloooooooooooooooooo
Well upload dream smp what are you doing?
me, 17, getting every reference and singing along: “ah yes. ancient times. so old.” pfff
Alternate title "4 idiots doing stupid stuff while theres a black hole consuming the world Exept for philza👍
Hi
14:29 *Food Wars intensifies*
Wilbur and Charlie singing all the songs I loved is beautiful
Wilbur:all of Tommy's fans are 14 Tommy: no some are 16 some are 18 Me who is 15: I am four pararrel universes ahead of you
charlie and wilbur are the BEST duo of all time
the black hole is so immense that the video itself is deteriorating as we type
Philza was talking about this on stream
ugh i really don’t like slimecicle wish he wasn’t in these tommy videos. completely deters me from watching
Bruh 6 million
“We beat up nerds let go do basketball and drugs” Tommy’s tiktok: Hello tiktok we are doing basketball today
Did anybody else notice at 7:53 tommy set  philza to creative
ITS LITERALLY BEEN AN HOUR AND HES ALREADY GOTTEN ANOTHER .01 MIL SUBS
I want to take a bite of the great omelet of the beyond :l
21:32 michael jacksons death
Ok first of as a person who has studied the latin language, kinda amazed that tommy actually used latin for that one part even though it said "english sentance that is true in latin" (look it up if you dont belive me 7:06) well done tommy i approve. One thing though Latin follows the sentance structure of SOV (subject object verb) so for it to be a true latin sentance, it should have been "latine damnationem verum hoc est Anglicus." but its fine, i just want to appreciate it for a minute.
Not even 30 seconds in, and I’m already ready for Wilbur to make a black hole cult
me: a forteen year old also me: knew exactly what song the were singing because i have the original just dance for wii B)))
i like how Wilbur makes lore for all these videos
Make something other than a mod video
nobody but Slimecicle: I'ma go in a black hole-
I'm a science boy lol
Tommy who used commands to see where the nearest fortress is and the editor didn't cut out enough if they tried to hide it.
The persona 5 music for Phil in the nether was *chefs kiss*
7:55 Did tommy just switch phil into creative?
mrbeast the lord of hell
oh
I love these videos SO much man- they're incredibly funny and i always look forward to them now :D
Wilbur: male chickens dont lay eggs *rooster**
When you don’t press F3+D quick enough 14:24
mr beast is typing...
Mmm this black hole is made of blackhole
My dad play clash royale since 2016...
Charlie: “I learned a cool trick in science class!” Charlie: *denial*
WERE ENT YOU AT 5 MIL A FEW DAYS AGO!? Not gonna lie that’s faster than DREAM
3:34 this is literally a no, no square...
Lol Wilbur has night vision pack?
3:59 they called me piss pants in school ;—;
As a 14 year old fan, I understood all of those references
no one asked this, but i'm losing my shit over the persona 5 awakening soundtrack while phil was trading with piglins and getting the blaze rods
Before you ask, yes you’re annoying, and no we won’t subscribe
*everytime Tommy & co beat the game with a funny mod* Tommy: Oh thank GOD we finally beat a challenge
I love that Wilbur and Charlie were trying to think of songs that that 14 year olds wouldn’t know but I’m 13 and I know every one
2 HOURS EARLY LETS GOO!!! Send me like plz :D

20:06 The lightning was like a horror movie.

Little did they know about the pink sheep. RIP
Charlie and wilbur kept switching character lines- sometimes wilbur was green, and sometimes charlie was purple
im tommy’s age but i understood every single reference they made🚪🐛 im out
i love that they always say "we *finally* beat a challenge" when practically every video you in fact *have* murdered the ender dragon
The most funniest mod ever is gonna be a meme soon. Reddit:IM ALREADY ON IT

8:30  dream smp lore in a nutshell
tommy you need to think of another thumbnail and title, it's been the same for every one of these episodes.
“All of Tommy’s fans are fourteen”  Yes Wilbur, I am fourteen. But what you don’t know, I have been taught well.... I have been singing with you Wilbur. I have, you don’t know my power of knowledge.. let me just,,  Toxic by Britney Spears Stronger Kanye West Then we have Ke$ha  And tbh the other songs I heard, I did not get😔 but I proved myself enough😀👍🏽 let’s vibe to music only 19+ ppl would understand :]
Fun Fact: If you were to observe someone entering the event horizon of a black hole, it would appear as if they were frozen in time.
I'm so proud Chommy is growing so fast
I live for the comedic synergy of Charlie "Doctor Sicle" Slimecicle and Wilbur "Doctor Soot" Soot.
Some are 12 and just know things 🥲🧍‍♀️
Dont laugh at my friend pls
ㅗㅑ호ㅠㅓㅑ로ㅠ
Is weird that I knew all the songs they sang
The super Mario galaxy music has NEVER fit a TommyInnit video so well
wilburs last words: WAHHHHH
Don't worry guys, even as a 13 year old I know this song very well from my child hood... also because I read Wings of Fire and this MAP (Multi Animator Project) reminded me of it  https://youtu.be/j9WiUuw-w5Q
150k likes in 2 hours pogggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
I don't think the mod is funny..      The way they deal with it is <3
imagine this all without intense music-
3:51  Look the portal has a smile
Ow
7:55 I wheezed so hard I nearly died. (look at the chat)
14:10 is slimecicle’s subtitles an editing mistake or was that on purpose?
Ahhh anonther video
I was born 2005 I understood all the references
Why would I unsubscribe at all? Give me ONE reason Tommy.
I hope Wilbur understands that we weren't born yesterday. Mention something like "oh remember Jimmy from WW2, what a lad" then maybe I'll give u the praise of being cultured. HAHAHAHAH
1:25
FINALLY
3 dudes aggressively autotune at an old man
Me who is 11 and knows all those songs
TOMNYOG
my guy growing better than dream OMG lool
So,etching funny is I am around the 13-16 age scale and I know both of those songs
That editing was top notch
Did anyone see dream when Wilbur was in his boat in the blac hole
Any one else couldn’t help to notice the halo music
Wilbur and charlie assuming we don't know these songs   People on tik tok: this is my time to shine
3:10 Wait how is- ohhhh shaders of Wilbur
i was literally hoping so bad that tommy would upload today
Waiting for the Mr.Beast comment
ft. KSI
Wilbur Im not uncultured i know what toxic is
I Love How U Guys Didn Cut The Scence Of Typing Command
wilbur plays *clash royale*
6.64 million subs how many stacks is that  He should do a 7 million special with like stacks of subscribers and he does a cool mod or something
I know all those refrences and im 15
IM SUBSCRIBED :)
This is exactly the same as dreams black whole challenge
That black hole be suckin 😳😳😳
I'm 14- XD
I got ur youtoozToday POGGIES
My guy almost has 7 mil subs before he’s even an adult,good job keep up the good vids
"All Tommy's viewers are 14" "No some are 16 and 18"  Offending 😐
Philza is like the most resourceful
OK I DIDNT KNIW THAT WILBUR PLAYS FREAKING CLASH ROYALE AND
3:47 I mean- tommy was not wrong.
TOMMY DIDNT START WITH “MOST PEOPLE FIND ME ANNOYING”
Wilbur is literally a hollywood actor worth 69million
This is the weirdest one so far, and that's saying something
7:49 philz’s sets his game mode to spectator
ALMOST 7M SUB!
7:52 or just me
I understood all of those songs and I was September 11th 2009
6 mil boisssssss
COOL
"Or is it terrence"  you be sayin mike is a black hole 0-----0
The one time techno wouldn't be pro-omelet
Pliza just PLAYING THE GAME  all day 🤣 and then PLIL!!!!!
Bruh I’m under the age of 16 and know all of those references Wilbur is just a boomer
Origin smp?
He forgot to say *most people find me very annoying*
can you invite techno in a mod video?
Wilbur getting sucked into the BlackHole  Me: That's *SUCKS*
5:33 oh come on hes not even hiding it now lol
Charlie reminded me of this kid that smoked weed in the school bathroom he is 12
20:36 I understand that reference and I’m a young boy
Finally. .. I'm. ... 2 hours early :)
When they went through the end portal that was very emotional, they jumped through the portal just as it was consumed by the black hole but when they look around they've lost someone. That's the kind of thing you get in tv shows
These videos are getting more and more existentially terrifying
Persona 5 music when Phil was bartering!?
When Wilbur continued singing Tik Tok while getting sucked in
1:23 *facepalm*
"What's heaven like?"  "It's red and hot"  well done Wilbur
slime heeheed into hell-
Tommy, Charlie, and Wiblur: mess around a lot Phil: actually tries to play the game
Tommy finally got his God pc
Yeah maybe I think Wilbur won’t play now
Modern Warfare music.
#freerommyfromprison
i am so old i know all the song references the kids wouldn't get 🙏
If it's a hole the what can I put in there 🤔🤔🤔
Tommyinnit has a waa waa face on his channel
anyone else see tommy locate fortress lol
Fools. *Everyone* knows of Kesha.
Tommy"it one of the two things I'm scared of"      LIST 1.blackholes           2.Women
this for real turned into stranger things like halfway through
black hole mod LOL
Wilbur and Charlie singing all the songs I know and I’m younger than Tommy
14:25 he searches for the fortress
Mr beast should comment
Something tells me that he was called piss-pants in school...
2:50 mmmmmm...... 14:24 mmmmmmm......
Tommy: I'm the golden boy not the piss pants                                                                   me: I think ur the piss pants
TOMMY I GOT UR YOUTOOZ TODAY POGGGGGGG
I want play with Wilbur and tomy
I’m 14 and got almost all those references
Summary: ph1lza beats game while Tommy takes the credit
I love how in the most stressful moment of the game, Wilbur and Charlie are just singing My Shot-
Wilbur's egg laying sound effect was worryingly on point
Wilbur is literally immortal
*mr. beast*
I subscribed
anybody noticed that tommy now bleeps the swear words in his videos??
Pov: You're reading the comments while Philza is doing all the work
When tommy was just casually cheating at 14:24, i felt that
I like how at the first part in the video Philza asks Charlie: *”So, Charlie how would you like to DIE?”*
e
That Mario galaxy music in the beginning was very nostalgic
I am 14 and I understand all those references
For some reason I understood every reference Wilbur and Charlie were making
You know, I actually recognized most of the references that Wil and Charlie were making... Do I have, like, an old soul or something, lol
Im 12 and i got all of slimes and wilburs song references
Charlie and Wilbur: Let’s make references Tommy’s viewers won’t understand   Me who’s 14 singing along with them
one word, karmaland
why is charlie wearing a dad shirt jsdbkf ??
loved the use of just cause 3 music, fit the mood very well
I can’t wait to watch this in the morning
When he said "I can't even see it" then it got back lit by the lightning... I got fucking CHILLS
The halo music makes the ending even better
the child cheated he typed /locate fortess
14:10 just shows the same captions 3 times
tommy is still awake bruh
Mr soot. I am 14 and I fuckin love those songs ...    I'm 14 and this is deep.
Phil: Actually progressing and having a time in the nether Will, Charlie, and Tommy:*Chilling in boats making puns and escaping a black hole*
technoblade.
Just a suggestion for Tommy he should turn off his chat so the viewers don’t exactly know when people r put in creative
Wilbur is bad at confusing people with music but out of the guess the song a while back that Wilbur did I knew them all so
Alternate title: Sus topics about holes while Philza works
i ddint sub :D
Another thumbnail of Tommy in it gasping for air
EVERONE FROM THE YOUTUBE GO TO THE TWITCH STREAM
Damm im 14 and i understand most of the reference lmaoo
Hi tommy
Nobody:   Tommy: I spotted that with my  e a r s
21:23 - 21:52 was by far the most intense moment
That lightning with the black hole was ominous..
Do the clay soldiers mod
You can see tommy put Phil in creative🤣🤣
20:38 Kanye moment
FUCKING LOVED IT
"Male chickens don't lay eggs" Okay buddy, they're called ROOSTERS imbecile lol
POG
I'm expecting a Mrbeast comment to pop up.
I love that every time they do one of these videos wilbur just goes fuckin cuckoo clocks
Yo great Philza creator of women as a women i ask why am I so ugly please
How is philza so good?
my gf just left me so this makes me feel like i wonk kill myself
can we have big Q in sometime soon?
20.07 what is that scream
Define "Very Funny" to me
Oh yes finally it has come 😂
I’m 11 and knew all the things Charlie and Wilbur were saying
YouTube suggested this to me as WilburSoot viewers also watch. I watch Tommy *so* much more than Wilbur, YouTube why are you making me look bad?
As a 14 year old I knew every reference that Wilbur and Charlie where talking about
BRUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I’m 17 and understood every reference Charlie and Wilbur were saying/singing lmao
Shot out to all the kings in this video 👑💚🤍💛❤️
Yay you've uploaded
No
Tommy in it has changed philzas game mode to creative
the most hilarious part is the ending of the video.
we know about Britney Will
Phiiiill????
wilbur: they’re all 14! let’s make a reference they won’t understand   wilbur & charlie: *sings songs in which i know the lyrics too and full song because older 2000s music is better so i know it  anyone else agree lMao
I like the starter jetpack
roses are red, violet are blue, black hole are stupid, looks like me too
words cannot describe how thankful i am that tommy puts captions on all his videos
I wanna see the boi techno in these vids
Let's confuse the 14 year olds Me, a 15 year old getting every single reference
PHANTOM THIEF PHILZA
TOMMY
The high pitched panic screams are my favourite
21:09 MY REASONS FOR LIVING
neverseen this format
has anyone figured out what the 'Latin' actually translates to. Its something like We are condemed to hell. This is true in latin.
7 MILLION INIT 7 MILLION INIT
From 21:40 to 22:05 was like a movie
Where is quackity
love the persona 5 music on philzas nether clutch
5:33 Tommyinnit in creative swapped back to survival Wilbur in spetator  5:40 Slime set *own* gamemode to suvival probably was in creative maybe spectator  7:50 Philza in spectator  7:51 Philza in creative  10:08 Wilbur in survival  10:23 Wilbur got a minecart  13:44 Wilbur is in survival  14:25 Fortress Located  15:08 Wilbur saved slime  19:08 Weather dissapeared  21:24 Wilbur in creative  21:28 Slime in creative  22:25 Slime in creative  Did i miss any?
I never knew that mr beast is satan who is very kind
Hell yes this series is life
I don’t like tommyinnit anymore
0:21 :)
HAHAHAHAHAHA
Edit error at 14:12
why did tommy put phil in creative
14:27 Tommy has a rtx 3090 I am triggered
Were is big q?
What a good idea!
In all words these videos are just wilbur making cults
wilbur really thought we wouldnt know britney spears or ke$ha- what-
E
its so funny how philza always makes the most progress in the game while tommy, willbur and slimecicle are running around.
"We gotta wun" - Tommyinnit 2021
They say 14 year olds wont get it yet i do
No one:  Me 12 jamming out to the songs they are singing: 💃🏼🕺🏼💃🏼🕺🏼💃🏼🕺🏼💃🏼🕺🏼💃🏼💃🏼🕺🏼🕺🏼🕺🏼💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼
The reverse Latin translates to "English sentence" and "This is true in Latin" according to Google Translate.
NOtice how Slimecicles subtitles switched to Wilburs
Hi Tommy.  You should take in all the fun and friends in you may not see them again!  Have a good day!
Now hold on a second
I feel like I've seen this video before already like what
Please the music this time added to it so much 😭😂.
I ENJOY!!! I ENJOY!!!
I love this series!! Pls continue
I appreciate the fact that Philza went full beast mode in the nether while the others were just rowing
6 minutes into the video and I just want to give up on basketball
Pog
“Let’s go do basketball and drugs.”  -Tommyinnit 2021
Never been this early lmao
i really like the halo music in his videos
Filza: *Speedrunning Music Intensifies*
Breaking News: Mr beast is god!
love that one of phil's titles is 'creator of women'
16:05 who else recognized that Just Cause 3 Music? I can still hear Di Ravello’s soldiers on the radio: “We’ve lost visual contact. All units, pan out and search.”
Now this is when things become truly bizarre
I like the persona 5 music when ever we cut to Phil 18:50
The other thing he's scared of...                   is women
tommy my favourite youtuber
the lighting behind the black hole look TERRIFYING
Wilbur just to clarify, yes i am 14, and yes i understood ur references 😂 just cus im a youngin doesnt mean i dont know some good music
Tommy is rocking that hair
screw u wilbur soot i got all of those references and im tommy's age :D
anyone isnt tired of "is very funny"
I don’t need subtitles but I appreciate Tommy doing subs on his vids allowing deaf people to watch. that’s fucking sick
philza is the newest character in persona 5 canon
Tommy is so fucking stressed (┛✧Д✧))┛. I can't breathe ಥ‿ಥ
I can not express how stressed I was when they were about to jump into the end portal and the black hole was right there
Tommy when did you get subs I started watching when you literally had less that 100k like wtf you are about to hit 7 million.
Your intro this time was so cheerful! WOW IM PROUD!
*laughs in fifteen year old and gets all the references wilbur is making*
wilbur really thinks i don’t know toxic as if i’m not gay 🤥☝️
i am 14 :D
Tommy these videos are hilarious keep it up man 🤣
Wilbur and Charlie really started singing the playlist from my middle school dance
SUBSCRIBEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
wilbur and charlie making "obscure references" was hilarious.
tommy, i have been subbed since 2 million, jesus you’ve grown a lot, good on ya!❤️❤️
I'm only 2hours late this is my earliest yet
I dint know wilbur play clash royale 19:32
The Halo music was sick
I like how these videos are all the same; Phil leaves to actually make progress in the game, Tommy does basically nothing, and Wilbur and Slimecicle act like total weirdos.
Hi tommy
I can confirm this is hilarious
Thats sooo funny philly
Can you please continue uploading Dream SMP videos as well im dying to see more of ur Dream SMP vids
sleep
1:21 he he AH!
He is wearing a DIFFERENT SHIRT
20:05
Tommy: Clash of clan Charlie: Jetpack joyride Wilbur: Clash royale Me: Remind me of these games
Dream did it first
Day 3 of asking tommy to replace slimecicle with tubbo or quackity
Is it bad that i understood every Quote Will made ?
the only black hole I'm scared of is my girl friends:)
Meanwhile Philza is just beating the game. Gotta hand it to him for being the only person to take the challenges seriously every time.
Dude Phil always finds diamonds and when they ask where he’s been he says casually “getting diamonds”
7:53 tommy set Philz’s game mode to creative
BOYS WE ARE AT ALMOST 7 MILLION PLEAAS SUBSCRIBE!!
If u can't beat it, then join it
Ah yes, my weekly dose of dopamine
How dare you call me 14 years old
10:07 c r e a t i v e
It’s funny how in most of these thing phill is just doing his own thing in all of these
Black hole: COME HERE BOI  Them: *CONFUSED SCREAMING*
I've noticed Tommy seems to like the name "Clementine" therefore i am legally renaming myself to Clementine
POV ur 14 and understand every song Wilbur and Charile were singing
My favorite white boy
Tommyinnit RN : ALSO WE'RE SO CLOSE TO 7M SUBSCRIBERS WHAT!?!?! Tommyinnit at 7M : ALSO THANKYOU SO MUCH FOR THE 7M SUBSCRIBERS GUYS CAN WE GET 8M SUBS?!?!

Tomyinnit running form the black hole to get to the end is like in jjba when Joseph runs form kars lol
7:08 "damnationem latine hoc est verum latine" translation: English sentence that is true in Latin
ngl I was extremely offended they assumed I didnt know TikTok by ke$ha because I was born in 2006
Pog
Um tommy just stick with mate not brother
Is it just me or is this like..the only time tommyinnit tryed to finish instead of goofing off..
"set philzas gamemode to creative"
20:23 I’m 14 and got it woo
i’m thirteen and getting all their references, i think everyone here gets them regardless of age😭😭
6:30 Was that Risk of Rain 2 misic playing in the background?????
WilburSoot: For science!  Me: My people!
I love how Wilbur and Charlie think those songs are obscure to gen z kids when I memorized Tik ToK at the age of 6
why is philza set to creative mode ;-;
The best part of all of this was Wilbur and Charlie’s musical moments. You can’t tell me otherwise.
im 13 and knew every song they sang lol
Charlie's just suckin :)
good video!
these videos should be called Wilbur and Charlie are acting like idiots while Philza and Tommy beat the game
Pog lol
Tommy, Wilbur and charlie: struggling rowing the boat  Philza: i speedran nether bitch
14:10 .... wait... what's up with the subtitles?
Yay he uploaded
Ironic, black holes normally shrink
https://youtu.be/6neB_WBvb5Y
“go speak to karl jacobs!”
PERSONA 5 MUSIC???
When they say that we 14+......SO IM NOT 12!?
Please dont bleat out words
wilbur really thinks we won’t know these bops
Wilbur thought it was the funniest mod ever but in reality it's the death of everyone and everything
poggers
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
did anybody notice that tommy is being a lazy boy and using the same laughing face each thumbnail
Am I still the only one that still see a little facial hair coming in 😶
Lol
I knew all those references
Level 9 ice wizard well how about a level 11 electro wizard nerd.
Do it for the child 2:44
This channel is very funny
Is it just me that got every reference? 😂😂😂
It’s ok I’m friends with mr beast!
Only Ogs remember the channel "Tomaye"
I have just heard wilbur talk about anxiety and its honestly he makes it sound like its not a bad thing but after listening i dont think i can see him the same🥺
I got every obscure reference  It was great
Let’s gooo!
where is tubtub?
Persona 5 music
"Hon English sentence is true in Latin"
11:25 *PEOPLE CHANGE LIKE TIDES IN THE OCEAN*
Wilbur, stop with the cults please.
plz Wilbur and Charlie sings songs that they think 2006 kids dont know is really funny like all the songs they sing wherent on the radio 24/7 while we grew up
He used the just cause 3 music at 16:17
Tommyinnit speedruning sub count
'FUNNY'
Someone make a compilation of Tommy screaming “PHIILLL”
Hamilton
Mmmm funny
TommyInnit set Philza’s game mode to creative mode
the cutting to Philza with the persona 5 to Charlie and Wilbur playing clash was funny
The best part of these videos with Phil is that he just goes and gets things done while everyone else is just in chaos.
Some 10 years old boys are here
*get this man more subs*
4:05 honestly this might happen no cap
I wish I could just watch YouTube all day because of these videos.
This is the most dramatic one yet
"Phil, I reckon I have a 3 step plan to take down this Black Hole, I'm going to get 10 million subscribers, then install Tinder, Illegally" -TommyInnit 2021

Wilbur and Dr. Cicle doing references that Tommy’s audience won’t understand Me: Ha you fools I’m 14 but I speak your language \_*-*_/

I knew all the songs they sang
IVE BEEN SUBED TO ALL OF U GUYS FOR 2 IN A HALF YEARSSSSS
i felt like i was watching a movie with how dramatic this got
Congrats on 6.64 million
The saddest thing about this video is that Wilbur and Charlie think we don't get thoughs music references.
Tommy and Phil: Actually trying to beat the game and win the challenge   Charlie and Will: Rapping "My Shot" from Hamilton   This is amazing.
lol
Wilbur makes the scene so much better
Mr beast watching this video like     👁👄👁
"I spotted that with my ears!"   ok tommy
3 of em doing science experiments, then you have Phil doing a playthrough
I’m missing quackity on these mod vids
I thought he said my name
Phil: *killing the dragon * Tommy: Dragon, you got no fans
I how you put "funny" in every video
Tommy, Wilbur, and Charlie: gets risky and stay near the black hole Philza: full survival mode
Wendy's grease sink bath
Never thought I'd hear Persona music in a TommyInnit video of all things.
I'm only 12 but I know every song that wilbur and slimecicle sang:)
Ah Yes In Tommy’s First video on this Channel he’s PG
Phil trying to beat the game,  Tommy Losing his mind, and Wilber and Charlie just singing early 2000's hits XD
Tommy finally knows what North is
why did it say ph1lzas game mode was switched to creative
7:08 why did i spend the time to see what this actually translated to wtf  i have no life lmao. btw it said "English sentence that is true in Latin"

Mr. Beast Lord of the Underworld
they say "we finally beat a challenge" every time they beat a challenge lmaooo
The way Philza carried the team LMAO
Me understanding ever reference
17:25 props to playing Will Power to Philza gameplay
me being 12 and knowing every song wilbur and charlie were singing
I think I pissed myself laughing nearly XD
“they’re all 14” - how did you 💀?
tommy.....WHY DIDNT YOU SAY "Some People Find me annoying when first meet my channel, if you dont, so please check the subscribe button" WHYYYYYYY??
Why does Wilbur slowly turn into a evil psychopath every videos

TEA
I hope mr beast doesn't see this video 😂😂
Not that I care but they obviously cheat
I have bean her since 1 mill and this guy just gets funnier

“Is it clementine or is it Terrance” never thought I’d hear that meme account again...
Funny
Tommy really making a new meaning to Funny, Funnier, and Funniest
I’m 14 and know all those songs
Love how I'm 14 and I understood almost all the references Charlie and Wilbur were making lmaooo
1 second later plz stop singing these songs i hated  pdiddy when i was 9 and still hate it yeah real funny guys
Nice Halo music you got there
im surprised Wilbur didnt make a cult where they worshiped the black hole, KALIMA
You can see that tommy is still a child beacause he plays this funny mods.🤣🤪
at 9:25 tommys laugh sounded like the beginning of "never gonna give you up"...
Go to sleep? Nah
Funny lets go do besketball and drugs very funny comedy man
Not Wilbur thinking we don’t know those songs I- 😃🤚
they out a BIG circle in mincraft
Wilbur: I just wanna say WAHHHHHH Charlie: My god..... Me:My god......He became waluigi~
The Biggest Black Hole Is TON 618 It CAN SWALLOW Our Solar System...
Imagine if MrBeast saw this and just commented "Tommy, you're coming with me! " and 2:08 looked like something from a horror movie or something and also, 20:59 Wilbur and Dr. Cicle is singing Tik Tok - Ke$ha :)
😳 when black is sus 😳
So is every video going to be mod video now? I kinda miss videos for things like the DSMP
Lol
Mmmmmm yes we were fed today.....
1:25 MICHAEL JACKSLIME
"You wanna shoot hoops with us"  Why is this something my best friend and I would say? 😂
Come on we need to give this man 7 million subscribers, lets do this bois.
wilbur just played clash royale in the middle of a recording is real shit
Did you get it from dream?? xD
wasnt expecting will power to play
At this point, Tommy will hit 10 Mil at 6 weeks or so
The thing I learned from Tommy is that if you die to a black hole Mr Beast will bring you back to life soo coooool
this is like watchin noble team getting crumped again
tommy: *in danger* also tommy: phiiiiîíïīíĮıîllllľłLĽĻĻLL
Anyone else notice Wilbur in max arena
Play this video in 0.25 speed
pov: you watched dreams video from 1 year ago

tommyinnit master of the algorithm by saying “very funny” and being the channel TommyInnit
just cause theme plays Me: happiness is my life
My favorite part when Tommy and Phil Play together and Tommy says- PhIlLlLllLlL
20:05 ok but that was SO cinematic
His goal, its ready, knees weak, the mass it's heavy, there's seed inside this hole already, arms spaghetti
Have you played clash of clan?
Philz was in creative and all of the people were using commands
“Male chickens don’t lay eggs why wheere yoouuu calllling it a *hhheeeeeeeaaaauaooooooo”*
5:55 They're high,😩⚠️They're high😍⚠️They have✋🤯✨dr0gas ⚡💥dr0gas ⚡💥 las dr0gas ❗❗❗LA MENTE 😭🌿 LAS DR0GAS ❗😡 LA MENTE☠️❗⚠️

I love how Wilbur is either traumatized or insane in all of these videos. Also, I heard something off the Persona 5 OST in a TommyInnit video and it feels like a fever dream.
charlie: let's just row with it me: hehe i get it
Dis hap
Why is Tubbo never in these vids?
Alternate title  Child get stressed then old man try to speed run and 2 nerds
Dream SMP died, so here is 20 million of the same videos with Wilbur Soot

Wilbur: Scientist Charlie: Assistant Tommy: Helpful bystander to everyone.         Phil: I just want to beat the game.
Wilbur: All your fans are 14 and won’t get any of these references        Me: *is 14 and understands every single reference*
I got all of wilburs referances xD
"I don't want to hit on him" - Tommyinnit 2021
Alternate title: Phil carries adults and child #8
love how philza is just casually doing all the work, while the others are just trying to survive for their lives away from the unstoppable black hole, and doing random stuff..
No one is going to talk about how he's playing clash royale
9:54 JuJu's weird adventure
It’s funny how tommy didn’t cut out himself finding the cords for the nether fortress
I'm now questioning how crazy they'll get when Tommy is 18...
Charlie : HEE HEE
“Let’s say things that Tommy’s viewers wouldn’t understand”   Me who knew all of them  👁👄👁
stop swearing dude its innapropiate
Aye tommy you will hit 10M before the may comes

IK ALL THE SONGS THERE FUCKEN SINGING

21:29 Philza: “What happens when we reach the end?” Tommy: “We’ll kill the ender dragon... and we’ll all go home...”
4:21 wilber dies and gets pulled in the black hole forever 8:08 wilber sacrafices himself for science and dies 13:35 charlie gets ahead of himself and gets sucked in the black hole 19:37 wilber gets pulled in the black hole after he wins against his last opponent 21:09 wilber and charile die in after the black hole follows them 21:51 charlie failed to jump into the portal 22:11 wilber gets slain by enderman 22:44 philza and tommy fall in the void
Who else was watching philza’s stream?
What are your opinions on ghostbur?
He like hit puberty on YouTube, Growing faster than ever before.
Aww if quakity was here it would 1000 times more funny
He stole this from the man in prison
no one:    pill literally just playing the video game:
Pog through the pain
eeeeeeeeeeeeee
He should play pixelmon
God i loved that end portal scene. That was like the last possible second.
Love how im 14 and i undersood EVERY reference- 😭💀
wilbur: “all of tommy’s fans are 14”  me a fourteen year old : 😳
Me a 14 year old, singing with Wilbur and doctor cicle     :0 ty to the two ppl that liked my comment, I never get any likes. Tyty
Wilber is always the villain in these videos
*WAKE UP IN THE MORNIN' FEELING LIKE P DIDDY...* (continue the song)
Mrbeast watching : 👁️👄👁️
Slime: Why dont you go hit him? Tommy: I dont wanna hit on him-? Or hit him
“He made a deal with the beast”
I'm kinda early pog.
14.23 'Nearest Fortress'
that Micheal Jackson moment at the beginning LOL
Was it just me or did anyone else sing along with Charlie and Wilbur during the TikTok kesha song 😂😂😂
Tommy is a child's name and he's name so Tommy is a child
Uhh dream about to get passed in a few months
Why aren’t more comments about the running joke that MrBeast is essentially an all knowing being who resides over heaven and hell where he gives people wrapped Tesla’s and brings lucky subs back to life?? That’s shits so funny
Tommy... How many times. SLEEP
Wilbur: *says some philosophical shit* Tommy: Wanna shoot hoops with us?
Thank u for posting today Tommy u are such a youtuber
The fact I’m 14 and understood what  Wilbur and Charlie sang says a lot about how much Wilbur understands our knowledge
that moment when they jumped into the portal at the last second felt straight out of a movie
FIRST 20,000 COMMENTS! LET'S GOOOOOO!!!!
“Maybe we should do basketball and drugs” -tommy           Quakity is the king of drugs
Moooo
Next vid: Minecrafts (____) mod is very funny
As someone who knows Latin, for anyone who's interested, the backwards Latin, translates to English sentence, this is true in Latin. :)
Hi mr beast going to joim
this video made my day
Lets make refrences tommys fans wont understand  Me 16yo: ok yeah what ever
Lol i knew all the songs they were singing
It would be satisfying if u could pop the black screen hole
Tommy, this is an intervention, you need to stop eating mud.
Remember when tommy posted the dream smp on yt
I literally didn't laugh once this entire video. World's funniest? Perhaps not.
POG.
I guess you could say it’s a supermassive black hole
watching this while everyone in my friends house agrues :)))) pooog
This was fr me and me friends at 3rd grade recess
Black hole:  *Still suckin* Icebergs: *Melting*  Tommy: *Surviving* Charlie: *Being a Doctor* Phil: *Playing the game*  Wilbur: *Plays Clash Royale and wins—*   Edit:  Bro how the hell did I get this many likes ;-;
14:10 IF I get sucked in
Oh pls I’m 11 and I understood all of your references
With your tittle “funniest mod” funniest video” sometimes I think    What isn’t funny
Love you
6.9 million
I am 14 and know all these references
Philza is just too cracked at the game
just dissing mr beast Lmao
Phil: mining, actually trying to beat the game Wilbur: experimenting Charlie: being wilbur's lab rat   Tommy: *p a n i k*
Welcome to the weekly mod mode
I LIKE YOUR DUCK CHANNEL AS#.
Wilbur: "let's make references that Tommy's fans wotn get"  me, who is brazilian and only started to see things in english 2/3 years ago: "Am I a joke to you?"
Leave it up to Wilbur to make a storyline in every video
Who else noticed that Tommy did /locate fortress? Does he do that for all episodes?
ok, now do a mod where if you die in the game you die in real life
"What's the most obscure reference that Tommy's fans won't understand?" "They are all 14" *Proceeds to sing toxic Me being 14: wow, you really underestimate me that much?
Tommy: u can unsubscribe at any time. Me: heheheheHEHEHEHHEHAHAHAHA
I am 14 and I got all the song references wdym wilburrr
I f**king loved Jetpack joyride as a child for some reason
*Tommy still searching words to describe how funny the next mod will be*
20:34 when you born 2007 and know it
Tommy literally gains 1 million subs a week—
Dear lord.
17:26  That Persona 5 music
Pog champ
Repetitive content honestly
20:22 Wilbur:What is the most obscure thing we can say that Tommy's fans will mot understand? Oh there all like born in 2006 so we can just go *Starts singing a songs I've heard of but don't know the name of(I knew ALL of the songs they decided to sing lol)* Me, a minor: Ah, you thought you had got me but I am too powerful for you mortal.
Pog
Subscribe to tommy it will look so cool if he had 7 million Subscribers

i feel hurt that wilbur and charlie thought i wouldn’t know those songs
They're getting tired of the best mod ever
20:28 they’re all 14  me who subscribed a few months ago: i’m 13
Eww
That lightning at 20:06 was straight from a horror movie. Terrifying
Pliza is creative mode
Wilbur: “Tommy’s fans are like 14 they won’t get the references.” Charlie: “Eliza..” Me, 14, with a Hamilton sweatshirt: 👁👄👁
got a blast of nostalgia from wilbur and slimecicle
This aint related to the video but i just ate a crossiant pumped with cream cheez and im feelin good
Its the way i'm 17 yet i knew every song wilbur and charlie were singing
imagine this was real, i would scream :(
POG
When he couldn't see it until the lightning... that was terrifying
Does it bug anyone else that Wilbur’s and Charlie’s subtitle colors kept changing
this is what happens when theatre kids try playing scientists lmao
Lmao me beast is going to watch this video and be like O-O
Don't lie to your self the 2 thing's your scared of are techno and women
If i see one more comment about "omg I got those song references I'm so quirky" I'm gonna have a fucking stroke
Running out of ideas
If you didn’t notice tommy put philzas mode to creative
When you're 12 and know what Will and Slimesicle was talking about.  XD
im in the 1st 12 hours
Tommy’s next video: the pooing mod is hilariously hilarious
Confirmed Mr. Beast is God
racist, disliked.
“Phil black holes are one of to things I’m scared of” What else are you scared of Tommy  Is it no having any woman left in the world
7:10 "damnationem latine hoc est verum latine" (Latin) = "English sentence that is true in Latin" (English)
YOOOOOOOOOO SUPER MARIO GALAXY MUSIC

18:26 this is actually a reference of Slime's DND podcast, Just Roll With It
21:02 i am 13 and i understood every reference
is it just me or is tommy getting better at everything each vid
Wow Wilbur you're assuming our ages I'm between the ages of 13 and 18 and I know the song Toxic so take that
I luv how philzas skin is uruhara from bleach
i love how philza is the only one who actually takes this somewhat serious
Why they RUNING IN TO IT GET AWAY
I wish charlie and alex(quaquity) would collab in these videos
Yoooh pogchamp
I got all of these 20:32
philza in the neather with creative inventory:...
wilburs right i am fourteen, but i knew the songs that they sang ✋✋
Phil carried so hard lol
tommy’s channel has grown faster in 6 months than the sidemens has in 4 years lol
Hey, I'm 12.
The got the hypothesis method wrong
“Tommy’s fans are fourteen they won’t know any of these songs.” “Wake up in the m-“ Me a 14 year old: I was singing this today
at this point hes growing aster than dream
21:59 top 10 saddest anime character deaths   i actually almost cried haha
Ngl tommy i think if you tell your viewers that they aren’t allowed to unsubscribe you will be at 7 mil b4 you know it
Them jumping through the portal was clutch
Every mod is “Very funny” lol it’s tru tho
Lol
Philza: *Fighting blazes* *18:40** Persona music intensifies*

Bruh they start talking about tommyinnit fans and then they start singing brittney spears XD
I'm 12 and I know most of these songs
Philza carried
your yee yee ass haircut looks like a bird's nest inside a 2.5 feet toilet in tge northen side of florida near a swamp
I appoligize Wilbur but I know all those refrences you said and im 12
A copy of dreams black hole mod 😂  lol
Guys, you should try the Tornado one, I couldn't stop laughing when Dream and George did it xD
These videos peak when quackity is in them
I feep smarter now
Tommyshittit can you just play something else your so boring and so cringe
"The Exploding Sun mode is very funny"
I feel like every time Tommy uploads he's approaching another million subscribers
I may be 16 but I’m not uncultured
philza almost got away with playing this on hardcore mode
<3 Clementine <3
BlackHoleBur is temporary, GhostBur is forever
HAa anyone else noticed his face in the thumbnail is the same every time? it's almost as if he just reuses pictures. but that doesn't sound like TOMMYINNIT.
Tommy made Philzas game mode to creative😭💀
Tommy's reverse psychology in the beginning: "you can *unsubscribe* at any time :))" *thinking* "hA they're falling into my TRAP"
14:10 you goofed the editing on the text
With all these Mr Beast jokes he has to comment on thos video
Gee, Tommy with mud these days.
I’m burgers
Nobody: Tommy for the last 4 videos: I can't believe we finally won a challenge
17:28 I see the persona music
Philza's always the one who wants to end thr game as soon as possible.  Chad
black hole: *killing wilbur feeling good*
tommy's team is litteraly the funniest- you guys should play bedwars 😏 I wanna see that so bad LoL-    And also... In litteraly 10 👁️👄👁️
*Everyone: Just filming the video* *Phil: **7:51*
I'm 14 and literally knew every one of those songs.
is that persona music I hear?
When they started making references 2007 kids couldn’t understand, I understood all of them
Potatoe
Lmao u adorable bean The fact that ik all the songs they r singing AND i still listen to hamilton lmao
Minecraft’s [MOD NAME] mod is [AMOUNT] funny
AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA this is so funny not gonna lie
Where's quackity?
fun fact: wheres wisp?
Wilbur: most of your fans are 14 me: "raised by the internet" try me
he just doesn't stop- tommyinnit just doesn't stop with these videos-
The Black hole is just a kardashian’s asshole
Moral is all mods are funny
Why are you copying dream?
Is it just me or Tommy says “funny” in EVERY SINGLE VIDEO!
why is there acting omg
And some are 11- and love that song 😀✋🏻
20:00 he playin the warzone music
4:25 I think that’s a mib reference
Tommy, Wilbur, Charlie and Phil are the best group to me rn
my 2021’s been pretty great so far with all these good videos Tommy’s been pumping out 👏🏽👏🏽
dont think about dream, think about tommyinnit
When you understand all the references that were made to confuse viewers...
spaghettified  feels like i remember a reference from regular show
so many adds
Philza with the Persona 5 music
I get both of those refrences----im 12
Oh it’s the polar bears... Little did they know that they’re gonna melt and it’s their own fault. - Tommyinnit
Wilbur soot sounds like the YouTuber exurba1
that is terrifying
Wilbur: “let’s do references the 14 year olds won’t understand” *quotes Hamilton which was made in 2015*
I actually used to listen to the songs Wilbur and Charlie were singing, and I’m 17. Lol
I'm 14 and I know all those references. Get rekt.
is it bad that im a teen and i know al  those songs
Wilburr
Pog?
Ima go in a black whole best song from Michael Jackson yet
I was 2008 and when Wilbur and Charlie where trying to confuse us I just understood all of it I was jamming out to toxic
When new smp vid coming
When tommy's saying PHILL!! I feel like he's saying DAD!!!
I love it when Wilbur Soot Always Start A Cult Every TommyInnit Mod Video LMAO
“It looks like it’s inflating”         Wtf?
Wilbur's onto me I was born in 2006.... 😳
"he got long and now he's gone!" alternatively: "he got wide, and now he's died!"  -wise wise words of Dr. Cicle, circa 2021
It’s sad that Tommy is doing this when Dream did it
I love how Tommy at the end of each one he wins says "We finally beat a challenge" when he was one like 3 or 4 so far, I can't remember exactly.
as a fourteen year old tommy innit watcher i can proudly say that i understood all of the song refrences wilbur soot and charlie slimecicle made this video
Man before Wilbur died for the second time he released his final waluigi waa
any fellow 14 year olds? 🤠
we gonna talk about the /locate command around 14:30 ?
Some are 16 some are 18 and some are 23 it's me I'm 23
20:34 I may be 14 but I was raised good enough to get theses references
Tommy keeps making these mod videos...              And in lovin it
7:50 did Philza cheat for his diamondssssssss. He went into spectator mode lol.
This video was completely legit and they never cheated I can’t believe some people think they do 🙄 /j
I a women and i am subscribed :>
Wilbur =singing old songs Me= *being ten and knows the song*
Bruh I'm Fifteen and both references will said tommys fans would prolly not get- I got both of them LOL
7:44 wilbur has a tic
I like how Big P is the only one that gets things done in these lmao!
You fool I know all references no matter what
did anyone see tommy giving Philza creative
Bald gang
i love the halo music
18:35 Woah does tommy like persona?
As soon as i heard "will power", i immediately subscribed-
wilbur saying all tommys veiwers are 14, me being 14 and knowing every song wilbur sang-
Same
14 year olds making jokes about 14 year olds so they don’t look like 14 year olds.
Love the vids
18k.commentor

WHERE ARE THE DREAM SMP VIDEOS, THERE HASNT BEEN ONE IN MONTHS
I love how tommy and phil ussually play the game but wilbur and charlie always fuck around
Love the clash of clan references
*hears 2 songs in jc3 ost*  me: :o
At 7:56 Tommy set Phil’s mode to creative
the fact they made it to beat the game was amazing. so much suspense.
the next tommyinnit video is gonna have the word funny or funniest on it.
Jokes on you willbur I’m 13 and know all the fuckin song
Tommy you screamed like a girl at one point in the video
Pog vid
I appreciate the persona musix
every song that wilbur and charlie were singing i know and i'm 14-
Anyone coming from philzas stream after it ended haha I think Wilbur didn’t expect most of Tommy’s fans even if they’re younger to know the songs and I literally know them and I’m younger than Tommy haha I know all of those references
Hey tommy u should record a zombie mod for a apocalypse
I understood literally all of what Wilbur was trying to confuse us with😐😑😐
19:32 "I won" He said in the most unexcited yet pleased voice I've ever heard.
me when i see the title: *this is gonna get good*
Tommy in it when he plays persona 5 music :D
mr beast won't be happy
anyone else looking for mrbeast's response in the comments
Every funny mod video: Phil: trying to beat the game Tom: being himself Slime: roleplays with wil Wil: roleplaying with slime
Guess my name  answers at the reply
7:05 damnationem latine hoc est verum latine. "the damnation in latin is true in Latin"
21:29 song?   by the sound of, it I think that this is from halo, but I don't know the name of the piece...
Dog
Yum
Came for the comedy, stayed for the existential terror
You know what I just noticed that he is playing the music from Just cause 3
Hey. Wilbur guessed my year of birth.        *Kind Of offended by the fact that i indeed know all the reference.* I'mma og child >:']
11:25 my head: people change like the tides in the ocean
7:51 I like the halo music
Tommy got banned on tiktok😔
If you look in the chad it said tommy in it game mode survival
THE P5 MUSIC
make video with all the mods jammed together
Ded
LOVE THESE VIDS
persona music
21:16 I think the  black hole really wanted to join their party
Still don’t believe that you are 6’1
I don’t want to hit on him or hit em
Halo music was perfect
I'm 13 and I ot all those references because I live under a rock.
Alternate title: Old man, child, corn man, and song writer die to a black hole
if mojang sees this vid and the black hole would be like: wtf why is there a ball not a square block?!?!?!?
The literal term for sphagettified is "getting stretchy like sphagetti by a blacckhole"
Your never not funny XD
The whole time the 3 amigos where rowing through a lake... phil did all the speedrun work 😂😂 and thats why we love these vids so much 😂
You have more subcribers then techno not to be rude
I’m not even 14 and I still get those references. *I’m not supposed to be on YouTube tbh-*
Me 13  Also me understands all of Wilburs references
I loved when wilbur and charlie started singing songs dude!!! I freaking loved all of them
Yes yes very good
He got long and then he was gone, he was wide and then he died..
Lava revivne 2.0
wilbur+charlie=funny
h i
What is with they captions Editor Larry?
Stop watching this there is no Tommy in it.
"go speak to Karl Jacobs"          - Tommyinnit 2021
circle doesn't like blocks.
Ok I'm 100% late xD
This whole video is like Dadza taking is 3 idiot children to the supermarket, and while he is buying all the groceries his kids angered some middle aged lady who’s now trying to find them and take them to the staff so they can find their father as they run away.
Me being 13 and know all those songs and sang along 😅
i love how Philza does all the work
One of the most intense disaster challenge mod
I swear in school tommy im a swearing muffin like bedboyhallo said
How is this man catching up to coryxkenshin in subscribers
Girls screaming when the lights turn off at school created this mod
I like how Philza just beats the game while everyone else is making jokes
,wither storm music starts playing,
I’m only here for the slimecicle puns
lol so funi haha
Tommy, Charlie on the edge of dying Wilbur playing clash royale
I may be a literal fourteen year old but i knew all those songs, and thats on being raised correctly
Charlie felt so self aware in this video, it was hilarious
Lel
why did tommy cheat to find the fortress?
1:25  this isn't for you, this is my replay button
It's just pass 1 hour ago. When I check it now, the likes are dangerously increased.
here before 1M views
love this series
Wilbur: nobody under 14 will get this reference  Wilbur: starts singing stronger  Me who had used that song multiple times in my videos:
Very funny
Is it just me or is Tommy's right eye higher than his left eye on his face?
I know those songs though...
his mic is in constant pain
I had to choose between watching this or watching Hamilton....... hard choice
Tommy Is it fine if i just let go just let go of life just live and stop planning and just stop caring i just wanna give up
Haha fuck the egg
I love how Phil was just doing everything
Me when I see the Video: oh well looks like OLD PHILZA is dead.
Slimecicle is always jk Tommy just listen jokes Wilbur roleplays and Phil is the one who actually plays the game
why does this remind me of the wither storm
14:10 excuse me but I think that is the wrong text sir
I just want to say I understood all the song references that Wilber had
Do a flood/tsunami mod
Some are 11
I just want to know why they were so many karl Jacobs references
When they were moon walking it took me a moment to process what charlie did and when I relized, I bust out laughing and my mom looked at me in actual concern and asked if I was ok
I’m thirteen and I understood like every reference will and Charlie were making lol
I got whiplash hearing "7 million subscribers" this is so weird. Like being here since pre-one mil this is so weird (but very deserved!)
Philza is the only one not cheating and actually playing the game lol
Wilburs first words: Wha-................*Dies* *WHEEZE*
10:07 lol
2:38 able sisters starts 3:40 able sisters sadly ends
the tnt surge and this vid are not even funny the only ones that are funny are with quackity
The amount of stress tommy had in this video was so concerning😂
did wilbur actually think that 14 years old wouldn't know toxic by britney spears?
Hearing the super mario galaxy music at the beginning gives me nostalgia of the game
golden trousers
I love the persona music
Sub or no kids for you
13:39 as far as I know, this is some of the best acting I've seen in a while
Almost 7 millions subscribers, congrats
20:34 Wilbur & Slimecicle - Toxic  20:38 Wilbur - Stronger (Farewell, Daft Punk)
Persona 5 music, nice
"Tommy's fans are all 14"  I'm 21 but yes
Looks like my profile picture already got take by the hole
7 mil subs! 7mil subs! COME ONN
“All of Tommy’s fans are 14” here I am, 22 and rocking out with Wil and Charlie 😂😂
My 11 yr old ass knew all the songs
Hope mr beast watch this
22:53 “I fuck this man”
everyones talking about important things but all im thinking about is the persona music during philza's nether scenes
Next mod should be the Undertale mod
22:05 charlie used creative
Some of him views are 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20. That’s what I think ;w;
Big Man good content (you child)
Is it just me or anyone else wants to watch Phil speedrun 🤔
Me if I were to play this: 21:50 My brain: No, you can't freak out over this, it's just a game! My heart: Haha, vitals monitor go beep...beep...beep..beep.beep beep-beep-bee-bee-bee-be-be-be- BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-----
Hi
At 7:00 the text translates to “Latin sentence” and “this is true in Latin” (google translate)
The black hole was smaller than hell and its medium and its large
Wilbur at the start be like: wut? *WHEEEEEZE*
Enters bastion Just cause 3 music starts playing* Me:wtf
If or when Tommyinnit passes dream in subscribers he will get all the woman
claim you here before __ badges here: 150k likes 500k views 20k comments
no one gonna talk about when phil was put into gmc?
'06 and got every reference Wilbur and Doctor Cicle made
Bruh
Tommy: *next to one of the most powerful and dangerous celestial bodies in the universe*  Also Tommy: T o u c h
When you realize Tommy falling back in his chair at the end is because the video Took hours and hours to make and he’s tired-  💀🤚🏽
im 11
14:11 "If I get sucked in,"
I called to the stars and they laughed at me is honestly a banger line Wilburs theatre kid energy is showing
Why is it that phil is actually trying to beat the game and the rest are just goofing off
Tommy wilbur charlie : the black hole is coming!!! Ph1lza: ok
17:27 the persona 5 ost does not sound fitting at all
So Wilbur plays clash royale
Better turn my volume down, I don’t want my mom hearing Tommy swear
IM first in indonesian
i know all the songs that wilbur and dr.cycle was singing
Truly is the worst and funniest mod
im 14 and i got all the refrences they said
Wilbur: 2006 won’t get these     Being born 2006 and getting all references
This is thee best mod ever so much action and especially when they were trying to get to the end portal
Can we just appreciate how Tommy uses Super Mario Galaxy 1/2 music? I just noticed it now because of the whole black hole theme lol
I feel like Tommy and them wouldnt be able to beat the game without Phil's expertise, theyd get caught up roleplaying as fish or some shit and never find diamonds
Like if Tommy is getting a diamond play button this year
Did Sombody fake it???
The fact that im 13 and ik all wilbur and Charlie's references XD
https://youtu.be/iik25wqIuFo
Why isn’t there a stream..?
TOMMYINNIT SAID MY NAME THAT IS VERY POGCHAMP
There all 14 they don't know these Me: singing with them
Congratulations for Wilbur because he discovered that eggs just don't comes out, it also come inside *AGAIN*
That Warthog run was genuinely fucking awesome. Was the last-minute portal jump planned?
His face seems awfully more pink am I the only one who noticed that
Remember me I played among us with you!!
Yay
I’m here TnT
Tommy!!
Who else knew all the songs Wilbur and slimecicle were singing?
I am nine
tommy it’s not good being awake late at night
If this was with big Q ughhh yeah hmmm it gonna be wierd
Tommy's logic : Phil is the creator of women (9:43)

Every title from Tommy from now on “stupidly funny”
I understood those references. I am old.

1:25 that’s a good Michael Jackson impression
Do a white hole next of you can please,
I know this is little thing but thank you for the subtitles tommyinnit
I love the use of halo music in these videos.
I'm 14 I I'm influenced by boomers every day so yeah I knew those reference.

Today We Filled a Pool with 3 milion paunds of Black Hole
7:53 philza creative
1:25
Is that the void I see? The black hole is salvation. Join it.
Posting while I’m doing homework? Yes.
Mod: *exists*  Tommy: *funny*
17:26 You know, i never thought I'd see the say where Persona music played in a Tommyinnit video
The persona 5 battle music while phil is speedrunning the nether is hilarious and I love it
I love your videos
Is this the first time they didn't have to use creative mode to get to the stronghold
Lmao jahahahahahaha
1:22
21:34  *intense halo music*  Everyone and me: Dead
GMT+8  08:00 a.m.  *I need to woke up early for TommyInnit videos.*
"We're getting close to 7 million subscribers"  So are we skipping the nice 6.9 milestone like that?
1:23
Wilbur: **casually floats into the black hole on a boat**
I know all of these references because my mom has good music taste (and is a DJ) and my dad is an anarchist so stfu
“He-he”
POG
Well true though when tommy started posting again the title always have the word "funny"
How's it going, guys, today I'll be reviewing goats and children sacrificed in my name! The best sacrifice will get another chance at life and 2,000,000,000 dollars!
Tommy is a now physics teacher  Pog
I CAN’T- THE PART WHERE HE WAS LIKE *”I’m going in a black hole”*
7:54 look at the bottom left of the screen
I’m thirteen and still knew all the songs Wilbur was singing
Funny tommy😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🙄🙄🙄🤬
I cant wait for animators to animate this cuz this is hilarious 😂.
What's in the black hole
7:49 bottom left.... WHY THE HELL ARE THESE SO DAMN SCUFFED LMAO
Tommy: What do you see? Wilbur: It's hot and red
Yes
The longer I watch tommy the longer I’m worried about him... 😂
Anyone else notice Tommy's chat saying where a fortress is using the /locate command at about 14:24?
Lollllllll
tommyinnit more like piss-pants or tommypissin which one is best btw tommy I love your videos please keep doing what you are doing
Me, a 16 year old: knows what wilbur and Charlie are singing* i have bested you
tommy has turned into generic youtuber with the same exact face in the thumbnails
Good some milk.....
I am sadly sick right now and your videos always make me laugh thank you for that
This is cool, if you try and post your account password YouTube sensors it ***********
This black hole does have rights to swallow them and the terrain but doesn't have rights to any other thing lol.  (this is a joke)
Why was the end of the video actually cool
Philza: let me finish the game Slime: Science time Tommy: Child Wilbur: plays clash royal
1 hour late😔
charlie looks like my stem teacher
I'm 14 yet I got all the references, pog
i just want likes
early? 1 hour?
so this basically means if he gets 10 mil subs he can stop the black hole by installing Tider illegally.. Interesting
why did the end when Charlie died feel like endgame
I’ve could’ve been someone.. instead.. I’m *late*
me being 14 and understanding it all:
Here before they summon the MrBeast demon
5:50
EEE
Nice Persona 5 Music
Wilbur bought the season pass
POG
Can anyone see Wilbur's clash royale name? Cause it's not Wilbur Soot
BLACK HOLE 🕳
Tommy, slimecicle, Wilbur and philza are the best

20:57, we gotta wun?
The and I'm going in a black hole michael jackson bit was so funny
if mr beast is satan the karl is a satanic priest
Charlie and Wilbur's comedic chemistry never ceases to amaze me
1:25
I- ¿1 HOUR AGO?
Alternate title:  Four people swear at a black sphere in a lego video game.
Clementine again I love that name it is very poggers
I know that song you don't fool me I may be 14 I still know that song
I recognize all those songs... mission failed.
2b2t Be Like:
Fun fact: the bigger the black hole gets the more hornier it becomes
I heard 2 references The song toxic And one of the songs from alexander hamilton
bruh me being 13 and getting all the references pogchamp
Is it just me or is the black hole lookin kinda THICC
20:08 when the lightning flashed, it gave me "when you see lightning flash and see the outline of a tornado...." anyone else with me on that?
Tommy i love your vids btw <3
Tommy's channel is growing so damn fast
YOOOOOOOOOOOO CHARLIE WENT TO THE INBETWEEN, FROM TALES FROM THE SMP

If this is right tommy has to heart my comment The seed for this world is 2375808209945065876
19:57 me: THIS IS SO INTENSE

I love you
I think I'm getting spagetified -Wilbur 2021
I love that I am 13 and understand all the 2000 jokes they made
My one thing I am embarrassed about is that my sisters somehow had me memorize TiK ToK by Ke$ha and sing it, it is on video on one of their phones from when I was 4. It is incredibly embarrassing and I had flashbacks when Wilbur and Charlie were singing it.
Yeah just like a massive black- 0:03
im sad that there isnt any mic loading
Yes
early i think!
"Imma going in a black hole" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
hhhhh
the mvp of this series is phil since he's literally the one genuinely working to beat the game lmfao
Tipsy~
Wilbur singing songs and he said I wouldn't know them bc in young. He said 16 year olds wouldn't I'm younger and I was singing right along with them😂😂. All the songs are on my early 2000 s playlist
*Tommy and Phil struggling to get in the stronghold* Wilbur and Charlie: "IMMA GET A SCHOLARSHIP TO KINGS COLLEGE"
7Million Sub is coming
Tommy watching mr beast and shlat
**video starts** "hey charlie, how do you want to die?"
from the time tommy finished the vid to now he has gained 0.01 million subs
Putting it out there that this video would've been the perfect video to put Supermassive Black Hole by Muse as background music 🖐️😔
"we finally won a challenge"  tnt colossal mod:
My phone say this was posted 1 hour ago but my phone is also saying that the comment were posted 22 hours ago  I'm scared
14:28 Omlet? You mean omelet or omelette?
Every time Wilbur goes crazy!
Wilbur and Charli is a ✨vibe✨
tommy you need to stream asap
Am i early-
"Let's just row with it" about 10 people are going to get that reference
Tommy's new catchphrase in these is: PHILLL I DON'T LIKE _______!!!!

Hello TOMMY
Perish in the great void of space cretin
"We finnaly beat a f*cking challenge let's go through"                -TommyInnit
Hi
20:05 looks like they pulled this straight out of a fucking movie
Yes 😁😁 wilbur and charlie with those 2000's song refrences
This doesn’t look hilarious at all, Tommy need some therapy.
Yay new upload :3
Right, so dont click on the suspicious links in the replies. Not really sure what they are yet, but my best guess is that theyre IP loggers. If you somehow dont know what that is, if you click it it will find out your IP and log it. So yeah, dont click the sus links.
e
wilbur:all of your fans are 14  tommy:No maybe 16,17,18 me:But im 11 👁️👄👁️
"He got long and then died" sure he wasn't bit by a certain spider?
I'm glad I undersood all of The song references
My friend just recently started watching you and I’m scared for her cause she’s straight
14:24 tommy cheats what a loser man
Give him 10 million subscribers so he can install tinder illegaly
I guess EVERY mod is VERY FUNNY
Just saying Wilbur i know that song and I am 13, next time you sing tik tok by kesha worn me so i don't get a concussion from jamming out to hard.
Im 16 I know everything
Charlie just wanted to moon walk 🌝🚶‍♂️
HEY TOMMY CAN I JOIN YOUR DISCORD??
MAKE IT POP   DJ BLOW MY SPEAKERS UP
whats with the halo music at 8:20
This is one hell of a rollercoaster, except its literally a blackhole
*When you’ve been waiting all day for tommy’s upload*        Yes my time has come
Is Phil wearing Jocat merch?
7 next week cant wait
IM 15 AND I KNOW ALL OF THESE SONGS THEYRE SINGING LMAO
It's funny how they talk about MrBeast all through the viedo
I can’t believe Wilbur didn’t reference another funniest mod video this time
"...it was HILARIOUS!" *insert clip of Wilbur being absorbed into a black hole and dying* yep hilarious
oof oof oof of of of of ooooooooof oooooooooof oooooooooooooof of
I'm here before 1million views claim yours here
HELLO TOMMY
And I just turned 15
Cool
We got lots of eggs come take a bite fill
i love how phil always just ignores everyone else and tries to beat the game
how u beat technoblade
Ok but no one's gonna talk about that Hamilton reference? I love it–
every video the subs go up by 1 million
18:00 *intense car chase*
I laughed so hard at "he went wide and then he died" and 20:05 is the scariest thunder silhouette ever
The fact that im 13 and knew every reference 😌
Famous last words  “HEE HEE”
Can u pls do more Dream smp vids cuz u do a lot of mod vids now and I miss the Dream smp vids pls :)
Does anyone else realize how many times they went into creative
oyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Guys I’m not long
grazy persona music XD
E
I recommend playing FNF (Friday Night Funkin') it's good content
Blaxk hole mode is so kool
PHILZA 😂😂😂
I understood half those references
Black? Mod... Racism? Nah.... is it true tho...nah black is fun
“he went wide and then he died”                                     -charlie 2021
Oh fuck
Hi tommy
Lol
cheese
you guys remember when this guy was on the dream smp?
I wonder what the Americans think about the Yorkshire accent abahahahaha a
I don’t know whether I should be proud or embarrassed that I knew every song they sang when I’m 13
20:05 this looks like a scene straight out of a horror movie where they only see the huge shadowy beast when lightning flashes and it's right behind them.
Still in the jail?
tommy, as 1 out of the many people out there who are going through a hard time i just wanted to say thank you. thank you for everything
I like how they said we wouldn’t understand because were young then went on to sing songs literally everyone my age (13) knows.
“TommyInnit set Philza’s game mode to Creative”
Every mod is ''very funny'' lol
Sup
tommy is the biggest inspiration of this decade honestly
Wilbur said that chickens need to have sex to lay eggs and that’s just not true
My favorite jatpack was the angel wings one
I'm getting sucked -Tommy 2021
Nutshell:  Phil: actually trying Wilbur & Charlie: making some f*cking weird game/roleplay Tommy: checking up on both to get content
Where u get these mods
Aooaooaooaooaooaoaooaooaooaoaooaoaaooaaoaooaoao
the p5 music with philza vs the mario kart music with the others
That’s not how black holes work and I’m tired of people saying that black holes suck up everything instantly, the black holes have lives! These stereotypes hurt black hole communities. Hollywood says that black holes murder everything, when they often don’t! This is just pure spacism.
Some of Tommy’s viewers are 12
a
*tommy running with worthog run music just put a smile on my face.*
Look at chat 21:10
Next video (in a week): "We're coming up on 8 million subs-"
Charlie and Wilbur are literally the most chaotic cursed duo. They balance out each other’s chaoticness but it’s enhanced by 1000% making them cursed.   Bro I was in a car accident so if that made no sense I’m blaming that.
#1 on trending baby get those comments out there
7:22 JIMMY??1?1? 😭😭😭
_LOVE U TOMMY_
Ah yes, Will Power a great song choice
Tommys thumbnail laughing near a black hole
Did anyone see that it says they when in creative
Back ground music?
Real space time speed distancing scale simulation
I feel like I've been waiting oh so long
They really said the 2006-2008 (I myself am in this timeline) kids wouldn't know toxic, stronger, the fucking jenika elizaaa~~ thing, and fricking kesha, I know every one of them. They suck at this.(this comment is made for humor, not serious, please don't tell at me)

Tommy is as dramatic as he is in Dream SMP roleplays.

Hallo just so u know tommy I simp for u •3• °3° •3• °3°
Are we just not going to talk about the part where tommy uses the modern warfare theme 😂
7:50 "tommyinnit set ph1LzA game mode to creative mode"
Tommy: theres 16/18/20 me 11 years old
I need you to hurry up now, cause I can’t wait much longer
Pogchamp!
Wilbur Soot has gone from worshipping the void to dying for science. He should really see a psychiatrist.
No
My 11 year old sister god all the obscure references nice try
TOMMY TUBBO AND RANBOO ARE STEALING YOUR HOTEL IN THE DREAM SMP!!!!!!!!!!!
Hola froggy
Lol
7:54 Ph1LzA set own gamemode to creative 😂😅
It'd be a sin as a 2000's kid to not know Ke$ha
I was baited I thought tubbo was here
ok i need to know what the 7:08 captions are. google translate is not helping
Tommy was wearing a different shirt in the intro this is a rare sight
They should put the avengers theam on this shit
Charlie that seems a lot bigger it seems as though it's actually grown - TommyInnit Thats kinda sus
You are soooooooo annoying, but I stay
*Them:* All of Tommy’s viewers are 14! What are some obscure references we can make?!  *Me, just barely 15, recognizing every song they sing:* _(laughs in knowledge)_
Everything normal I'm going to bed It's 2 am I get a notification      Sleeping is an illusion      Have you seen 4am? Well, yeah...
PogChamp TOMMY GOT MORE SUBS THAN TECHNO!!!
Wilbur and Charlie brought back so many memories... Dang 😔🤚
OMG I was here BEFORE this blew up I was the 123rd like
20:32 -21:22 He does understand the legit everyone has heard those songs/references even if they are 14 right? I'm just saying... or maybe I spend to much time with my parents, idk
They won the battle but lost the war
I like how he used persona 5 music
20:05 this part felt like something from a horror movie. O_O
the halo music got me in the feeeeeeels <3
wanna really know what the demonic Latin will spoke means at 7:06? well I did. here it is 'damnationem latine hoc est verum latine' which translates to 'English sentence that is true in Latin'
My friend complaining when Tommy was gonna post  Video : *pops up*
“Idk let’s go play basketball and do drugs”       -tommy

Congrats to almost 7m bich boy
UMM DREAM TOMY IS STEALLING VIDS AND MAKING THEM BETTER
Lol
Ngl though, that bit where Wilbur got trapped under the ice was genuinely ✨ cinematic ✨
ya not very funny just...DEATH!!
I like how multiple times the color of Wilbur and Charlie's subtitles switch.
I like how tommy only cares about Phil
@MrBeast
That mario galaxy music at the beginning fit well
Ben dover
Joke's on you I know those songs 😏
You know. They said that tommy's fans are all 14  And I'm not even insulted. That's entirely true  *But jokes on you we still know 2000s pop songs*
Tommy
The editing is getting a lot better
Omg wisp and tommy
I'm so happy slimecicle is part of this group.
The way he grabbed at his head when his blood pressure dropped— I felt that man
where is the taste review
"he was like a brother to me" i assume he was expecting Wilbur to step in and say "stop it or im gonna cry"🤣 god i watched so much of them i can already see the pattern 9:20
Charlie not getting to the end! Gut wrenching content. beautiful
TOMMY USING PERSONA MUSIC??? POG

I’m 13 and got every single reference lol
I loved the bit when wilbur and charlie were singing older songs and I, a 15 year old, knew every one of them
It would be awesome if the black hole bend light just like how it does in real life
philza is like the only one who actually cares about winning the game nwith tommy or smth like that and charlie and wilbur either complaints about everything starts going insane or starts their own cult.
That timing with the lightning revealing the black hole was terrifying.
im 12 and understood all the refrences, im jammin
I’m in the age range Wilbur and Charlie were talking about and I can safely say I jammed to all of those songs
20:59 GRAB MY GLASSES IM OUT THE DOOR IM GONNA HIT THE CITY
Your Local ModdedTommyinnit quoter is taking a break due to a headache. Very sorry y’all :V
“HéHé” *dies*
wilbur: tommy’s fans are between the age of 14-16 also wilbur: let’s sing toxic to confuse then they will have no idea what that is
Gun mod pls
Them singing  Me: I know all of these
Pog love to see another of the series man!
I im subscribed and I followed you on twitch
F
Technoblade hit 5 mil first  Tommy stand be like  = Well then for the 6 and 7 mil we Will hit first for the win
ELIZAAAAAAAA
20:05  that was ominous as FUCK
Where is Quakity:C
Man this video "sucks"
charlie slimecicle is the funniest character in these videos i swear
Tommy: very funny Phil: I'm getting diamonds Slimecicle: makes jokes Wilbur: *high and drunk*
I’m 10 and I knew all the songs that Wilbur and Slimesicle said
Pog
Dang I just subscribed and the sub count changed from 6.3 to 6.4 mil
¡LANGUAGE!
Almost missed this before I went to bed
Tommy: we finally beat a fukin challenge   Morph mod: am i joke to you?
the editing was off...
SOME ARE 9 LIKE ME
I love how Wilbur and Charlie were trying to sing songs that 14 year olds dont know and yet I knew every single one
Everyone knows Toxic
Persona music in the nether
tommy /located the fortress LMAO
a
I miss Quackity
Tommy with beard?
Who wants to make a ender dragon fan club with me?
Look here I am 15 and I got all the song references
Wilbur died for content. Pog
tommy:he I got obsidian the most strongest block in the game  me: no bedrock is
wilbur and charlie are the ultimate combo
This isn’t bey FUNNY anymore
I hear you Persona
15:16 how can Tommy’s voice go higher than mine
charlie: how many meters are you wilbur: i'm approaching four or five charlie: is that more than normal wilbur: it's about 15 feet charlie: charlie: is... is that more than normal for you...?
they actually made it further than dream did :O, Phil carried, as always
You hit 3 mil like a month ago- wth happened????
I love his mod videos they’re so entertaining
I am udderly offended that Wilbur would ASSUME that I didn’t know those songs.  ...    DONT STOP MAKE IT DROP DJ BLOW MY SPEAKERS UP TO-NIGHT IMMA FIGHT TILL WE SEE THE SUN LIGHT
definitly didnt see tommy put philza into creative mode
Awsome tommy grew 1k subs in 1 hour!
loving the halo makes me feel like a boomer tho lmao
im going to get 10 million subscribers and get tinder illegally
Ah yes, the lord of both heaven and hell, mr beast, I forgot he killed satan and god last week for a $1 million charity stream. Also the first thing Wilbur went to as to try and make everyone confused was toxic, which isn't even the best choice, come on you guys, jump in the line is way more obscure.
at 20:06, the lightning flash makes that so much more terrifying.
waiting tommy to hit 6,66 million sub
Hmmm, can we talk about 14:25 ?
The Halo ost in the background as Slime and Wilbur testing stuff with the egg 💀💀
i’m fourteen yet i still understand the reference Wilbur. checkmate
i like this video
The line about Tommy's viewers sorta was true cause I was born in 2007
Tommy and Charlie losing their shit because of a giant black hole about to kill everyone  Wilbur playing clash royale: I won👍🏻
I'm JAMMING plz more Halo music
Looking forward watching your videos
I needed the funny vid today ty :)
They ran out of content.
20:05 is kinda terrifying how the lightning reveals the black hole
ponus
So MrBeast is the lord of hell
Tommy, thanks for making my lockdown insanely happier.
U look the same tommy
Wilbur and Charlie singing Hamilton is the embodiment of a mood
I was eating ramen....         Was is it coming out of my nose
good day hope yall are all good
my brother is a year older than Big T and yet he's way more successful
Idea: We try to beat rlcraft with Forge Labs
I love this like how did someone even you who ever made the you know make this
oh wow tommy, oh wow.
People who were here at 3 million subscribers or longer                                                 |.                                                                                   ¥
Who came from philza stream lmao
I heard that just cause 3 music tommy 👀
when wilbur and charlie were making those references i knew every single one  and I'm 14 -_-  this is saddening
yeah that reality ending singularity sure is funny
#addquakityback
The dislikes are from the chikens
14:11 looks like larry made a bit of an editing mistake there. Time to fire him.
When you run out of ideas for a title yea we will just put is funny at the end of all of are videos
tommy: gets over 6.5m im close to 7m
Tommy please like my color comment
Anyone notice tommy put phil in creative
“This was hilarious”   *I don’t think I would laugh*
Im 13 and i know those refferences just sayin
Tommy you gotta get back in the streams man
tommy:i’m friends with mr. beast   mr. beast: destroying the black hole’s car and buying him a new one
Why does will always get terrifyingly enlightened during these?
Give me a heart
Both charlie and Wilbur assumed that a 14 year olds would not recognise their references  Me a 14 year old who knows these: 👁👄👁
Just downloaded Clash of Clans lol😂 and Clash Royale
this man has 1000 mods
He he could never make it
Nice try Will but as a 14 year old I understood all those references
When Wilbur started singing Tick Tock I sang along and then clicked off the video to do karaoke. I have no regrets. :)
🔴🥳JESUS LOVES U HE IS THE ONLY WAY TO HEAVEN REPENT HE DIED FOR YOU AND YOUR SINS GOD BLESS YALE 🥳🔴
I am 13 and new every song wilbur and charlie sang xD
19:33 uhmmm wilbur thats not clash of clans thats clash royale xD
and also NOT all your viewers are 41+ im 12 and i'm about to be 13
5:13 Me: Oh no, anyways
Fuck sake shut up about the blackhole
4:49 Reverse colors
IS THAT PERSONA MUSIC I HEAR???
i think that wilbur was drunk and/or high
Mr.Beast watching like: 👁👄👁
1 hour ago this came out and already had 17k comments.
Thank you for making this. I'm being sent to a mental hospital today and I ain't got no choice. This cheered me up and calmed my nervous down. Your my man Tommy!
* Every time Tommy is in trouble* PHIL PHIL
Mmmmmm woman and drugs
Tommy ur face is for a friendly youtuber but dude why not if you are gonna be one your gonna be rich.
I know 2 of those refreances
We’ve seen many "funniest mods"... but the real question is..  Which is the funniest?
7 million wow I remember when he it 2 million
18:26 as a avid fan for a while now, I did feel my heart break a little
In Tommy's mod vids they find the fortress really quick. IT TOOK ME 5+ HOURS TO FIND MINE
PHILZA WITH PERSONA MUSIC, BRUH
Why does this have the call of duty modern warfare soundtrack
You should do it on hardcore
Haha black hole goes brrrr
NEW VID LETS POGGING GO ANOTHER WAY TO USE MY TIME POG
We all love phil- Tommyinit dont we?
CONGRATS ON NEARLY 7M YOUR VIDS ARE AMAZING!!!
45min
was the editor drunk?
tommy used halo theme song as god dam dramatic music
Wilbur: "They're all 14"  Me: **how did he know...**
This was pretty holechamp ngl
Slime: "So Wilbur's dead" Tommy: "HaHa Oh Well"
Literally tommy: "Very funny"
Almost at 6.9 million subs
B A K H O L
Ayy
I am very racist this is so pogchamp
1 hour 119k likes, damn this kid really got popular
i remember when i first found your youtube i thought you were annoying but now you are my favorite youtube 😌👍👍👍
I may be young but for the record I know what those songs are and may I say          Don't stop, make it pop, D.J., blow my speakers up Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight Tik tok, on the clock, but the party don't stop!
tommyyyyy
7:51 Did anyone see the chat or is it just me😀
Okay but why was Wilbur and Charlie singing Tiktok really funny to me😂
My man uses the same fucking thumbnail face and title format what a fucking madlad
That laugh at the thumbnail
I never knew wilbur played clash royale as slimecicle huh
TIDES IN THE OCEAN ROAD TRIP REFFERENCE 11:24
Tommy: not all my fans are 14 Me who is 10 but has been watching since 8: =D Tommy: their also 16 and 18 Me who is 10 but has been watching since 8: bruh -.-
This wasn’t about black hole this was about CLASH
I'm quite surprised that he's still getting the growth of viewers it's just the fact people enjoying it's probably the younger viewers watching this  Dislike for older viewers So I can see how many are there
hi
Here before 1 million views
Looks like the joke’s on you Charlie and Wilbur, because I’m 10z
Hello tommy ur the best
MUSTACHE
hi
ℸ ̣ ⍑ᒷ ⍊ 𝙹 ╎ ↸
I like how wilbur and slimecicle think gen z people don't know those songs....dude those are the only songs my school plays at our annual senior hosted chritmas dance party. He may have gotton to see that era of music at an older age...but gen z was born in it. Or at least my classmates and friends were. ( me continues to replay them singing the songs while jamming.)
When Wilbur speaks backwards in 7:06 I flipped the image, translated what he was saying and it says “English sentence. This is true in Latin”
The latin at 7:08 translates to "English sentence" And "This is true in Latin" According to google translate
SOME VEIWERS ARE 10
Slime: so let’s just roll with it  Tommy: breathing intensefies
Who knows this song? 19:00
Anyone else try to zoom in to friend wilbur on clash royal but too blurry?  Just me ok ill leave
“Phil, can I call you-?” “elIezAAAaaa”
Slimesicle makes this a lot funnier lmao
I’m kind of insulted that Wilbur and Charlie don’t think I’m of an age to know toxic, stronger, and tik tok
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH KEEP IT UP TOMMY!
Phill: just focusing on going to the end The others: what black holeeeeeee? Also them: dying an talk abt mr beast giving them lives 👁👄👁👍 all fineeeee
7:51 chat is looking interesting today
F
im really impressed that i knew what will and charlie were talking about for a 15 yr old
Phil just here to beat the game
PHILLLLLLLLLL
20:03 horror movies be lije
Persona 5 music?
at this point everything is funny to tommy.
Irrelevant but Can somebody explain what fetus munchers vol 1 + 2 is. I've heard it's illegal to watch and really want to know why it's called that and why theres TWO. Thanks
LET'S JUST ROW WITH IT YESSSSSSS
7:07 is "English sentence." "This is true Latin."
wilbur as a 14 year old i knew every song you sang and was singing with you-
you know you're old when you understood all the references will and Dr Sicle made to confuse tommy's young fans
Anyone else love the use of the Halo Soundtrack? Just me? Ok.....
You should all play one block skyblock like wilbur did with pyro, that would be hilarious 😂😂😂, pls pls pls take this into consideration:/     (like if you agree)
Black hole
Waw i can't believe someone took an apocalypse as a sense of humour
Anyone see creative for phil
Comment
Its just today that i discovered that philza's skin is based on the anime called "bleach"
They don’t call it the end for nothin 😏
TommyInnit’s brand now is just... DanTDM on crack.
If im honest, i click these in the hopes for bonus Slime and Schlatt content
Since willpower from persona 5 played ima ask a question,if tommy had a persona who would it be,i think it would be alexander hamilton,or merlin since womanizer or some shit like that
When he said "Male Chicken dont lay eggs", I felt that 😔
Has anyone  noticed  that Quackery is gone 🤔
wilbur and charlie wildly inaccurately guessing  what 14~18 year olds wouldn’t know is hilarious, they’re just singing songs directly in my demographic, like pulled directly from all sleepovers i had as a kid
We gotten wun
lol
hi
Damn you made 0.01 more subs in one hour-
Philza: speedrun music
I miss big q you should have him in the next one he is so funny
Wilbur: the quite kid with friends that accept him Charlie: the guy that have the popular kid and quite kid energy flowing through his body Tommy: the okay with everybody Philza: dream speedrun music
Didn't the dream team do th-
20:05 those lightnings were the most epic thing i've seen in some days
wilbur thats clash royale not clash of clans
Tommys content is addictive for me.....i NEED MoRe!!!
Get your here before 1 million views ticket
lets ignore that philza changed gamemodes 3 times
THE CLUTCH AT THE END.
*_W H E E Z E_*                       thats what you wanted to hear right?                                                                                                                                                *_P O G  M A T E_*
hmmmmmmmmmmm.....       tummyinnit
How does Wilbur come up with the weirdest shit 🤣🤣
all the videos are the same will and slime. are going of and being stupid while the other two are doing the hard work

It’s growing, menacingly
21:15 TIKTOK BY KESHA. YASSSSS. I LOVE THAT SONG!!! YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW HAPPY THIS MADE ME!!!!
Yay in early

TommyInnit
2mil sub gang =

The best days of the week is when tommyinnit uploads
mrbeast is not friends with tommy 3 reasons he killed tommy in the maze vid he said to him that he doesnt talk to him in the among us vid which karl won that and he just backed out in tommy's call! IN THAT 100,000 gift card challenge!
i was born in 08 and i know all the songs wilbur and charlie sung *improve*
CawCawwwww
Tommy has a 3090 rtx now thx for reading my comments and buying a new pc with 16 cores👍ryzen
Tommy you should link the mod or if you made it then you could have a patreon cause I would love to play this myself
I'm 12 and i knew most of the songs lol
"we finally beat a challenge" said tommy, moments before being sucked into the black hole and dying
That sudden persona music really hits
gotta love how nobody ever mentioned phil just randomly dying to an iron golem while tommy and will were peer pressuring a chicken into pedophilia
are you implying that mr.beast is the lord of hell?
I love how some parts they just go into creative mode in some parts
Damn
Mans got banned and got unbanned on tiktok 😅
E
earlyy:>
lmao will is only on electro valley
Ummmm 5:32 any1 else see something in chat?
i cant wait to see these guys play fundy's game modes
When you run out of adjectives for your videos
I KNOW MOST THE SONGS THEYRE SINGING CAUSE I SUNG THEM-
While the Three Sleepy Musketeers are goofing around with boats and black holes, Philza is the  only one playing the game the way it was intended.
Looks like Tommy is coming up to 10 mill
Weird backwards message said something like   English sentence, this is true in latin  Or something like that
I'm 11 and know those songs-
Charlie has been in a lot of the SleepyBois videos, has he switched from the lunch club from the sleepybois?
Pog
is it me or is tommyinit is using the same face for every single thumbnail?
I hope u know I left a philza stream for this lol
i counted more cheats than subscribers u have
“All of Tommy’s fans are fourteen they won’t know any of these song!” - Me, turning 26 soon, looking into the camera like I’m on the office as they sing the songs of my generation.  Edit: Y’all there is a clear difference between knowing the songs and the songs being a major part of your generations identity. Like how I know The Beatles but I wasn’t apart of the generation where they were a massive force in the entertainment industry. Chill out with your “I’m fourteen and I know these songs!” comments because that’s not the point.
When you are 15 but they didn't mention it f
Oh YEAH
Trampumatic flashbacks to when Dream and George did this
“Ahehe, AHHH”
Wilbur I know all those songs 👹
Slime: “guys I’m so looooong”  Text: “IF I get sucked in”
Nice....
this is the funniest comment ever
Mod link pls?
I can't believe i'm here before 1 mil, damn
TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES

Will and slime died for damn science
Tommyinit Likes persona 5 Confirmed
I can’t believe the staple bit of this video is “Mr. Beast is a lord of hell and can resurrect the damned”
wibllur suit
Everytime Tommyinnit uploads a video it makes my life a whole lot better
Dam wilbur and Charlie must be old if they think we don't know those songs 😂

Pls dont sware pls its annoying
Fr every mod they come across to Tommy says its *fun* when some of the gang is having a stroke-
Willbur playing Clash Royale is mood
funny
Tommy: Phil, where are you, we gotta "wun"
wilbur really thinks we wouldnt know those tunes?
terrifying things = funny.
the song references had me wheezing 🤣🤣🤣
Is no one going to talk about how tommy /located the fortress?
It was so intense when they jumped in the end portle 😯😯😯😯😯
Them talking about Tommy’s subscribers being 14...  Me being 14... “really😐😐”  Them start sing a song..  Me: start to sing with them.😂
TOMMY:Trying get in to the nether  CHARLIE:trying get in to the nether WILBUR: trying to get in the nether   While Philza:speedruning
tommyinit
yk tommy was so annoying the first time i watched him but now hes my fav youtuber lmao
This was the most epic mod of all of them
Everyone subscribe let make tommy go to 10 million so dream dont bully tommy anymore!
They beat the game... but at what cost?
The black hole being invisible in the night sky then seeing it visibly for a split second due to thunder is the most terrifying shit I've seen all day
this is the funniest vid yet
where is big q
So “ Apparently “ If you survive a Black hole you are able to go Anywhere, so where would you go?
I can’t be the only one who is so jealous of tommy
so tommy plays persona 5?
I know all of the references they mentioned and I’m 15
Tommy its midnight
Felt more stress watching this than I did on my AP exams
i can guess tommy will never ever reply on this comment at all   (changemymind)

Like how they have MW 2019 music in it
I hope Mr. Beast comments on this video.
damnationem latine hoc est verum latine - demonic mrbeast as said by Wilber
"""" Whoever is reading this, God bless you and your family.
Wilbur does experiments on the black hole but no one talks about how he literally pulls matter out of the air 😐
I’m 13 and I got all those references....*head in hands*
"""" Whoever is reading this, God bless you and your family.
Dream also did this mode
"""" Whoever is reading this, God bless you and your family.
Heyyyyy
Was i the only person who saw tommy go out of creative at 5:36
"""" Whoever is reading this, God bless you and your family.
Wilber has been noodleated
"""" Whoever is reading this, God bless you and your family.
that moment you're 14 and knew all the songs they sang
"""" Whoever is reading this, God bless you and your family.
So many ads
: D
Nice Just Cause 3 music 15:16

Tommyinit

This Is Just An Early Comment, Leave I Guess, Nothing Here.                  I SAID FREAKING GO AWAY
TOMMAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I like that editor Larry used warzone menu music for the epic moments
damnationem latine hoc est verum latine  Which, on google translate, translates into "English sentence that is in true latin" I mean yes, that is true. (Btw the text is is reverse on the video.)
🤨 seems pretty realistic to me
Bye i have to watch pokimane
Charlie do be moon walking though
Are you 17 now
IM A GOING IN A BLACK HOLE
Will ur bommer is showing thinking we don’t know what jetback joyride, toxic, or tik tok is

Hi
anytime Tommy uploads a mod video, i just expect Wilbur to go insane somehow
These people need help ASAP! Do I need to call 911 like for real LOL!
the real question is how tommy has a 3090
When will you make a video with Tubbo?
Tommy fans won't understand the references me:Casually sings along Like im young not uncultured-.
Lol Wilbur went creative to get out
That hole's nothing compared to my future.
Philza: does everything Everyone else:                                                                            *lets just row with it XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD XD  XD XD SO FUNNY HAHA*

I just love how Charlie and Wilbur's brains are of the same wavelength. Like they always come up with the craziest sh** the world has seen and make it work as the video progresses.
THEY STARTED SINGING HAMILTON XD
Tommyinit in 2021: *still isn't number 1 youtuber  Me: HE NEED SOME MILK
I'm happy to say that every reference that slime and will made I understood and I'm 14
Wilbur: Tommy's fanbase are all 14 My old butt with 19: tAste Of youR Lips I'M oN a RIiiIDEEEE 🎶
imagine your last word were just "hehe"     on your death bed and your about to die with your family around you and your just like " *I just wanted to say "coughs" he....he* **dies**
WHERES BIG Q
Tommy, Wilbur and Charlie - Messing around Phil - Actually doing stuff
Tommy saved himself from saying "Im getting sucked" 0:47
finally i'm early
Before watching, i bet that Wilbur will make a cult over the black hole and call it the “HOLE”
20:34 Toxic - Britney Spears 20:40 Stronger - Kanye West 20:44 don't know, don't care 21:00 TiK-ToK - Ke$ha  Also 22:04 Objective Charlie has been lost!
YASS

I am in my hooker palace
PHILZA had the time of his life in the nether with no kids
Bro im 13 and i know what infinetly small is

Clementine has RETURNED
The best part about these videos is that, at any given point, you can see “ *set own game to creative mode* ” in the game chat
I wish I was the hole 😉

Wilbur turned into Wario at one point. Man said "Waaaaaah!"
Wilbur is writing a different script nowadays 💀

Anyone here from London?     Cool, I’m from the US
hi tom
I'm 17
Wilbur playing clash royale
Tommy how much do I have to pay to get into the dream smp
When Wilbur "spoke Latin" the words written backwards said "damnationem latine hoc est verum latine" which (according to Google) translated to "English sentence that is true in Latin" idk I found it funny
Did I hear just cause 3 music in the nether?
I love those vids🥰🥰🥰
The Mr. Beast bit fucking killed me 💀✋
Hey Tommy, when I get two moths, I'll name one Clementine and travel to you and give u the moth.  Thank me later
its pasta time
14:24 imagine
Wilbur and charlie were singing 2010's songs- they must think were all like nine
omg this came out today     this is horrifying
I love how in all of these mod videos Philza is just trying to beat the game lol
Is wilbur in a hotel
Wilbur: what won't Tommy's audience understand? *starts singing toxic and tiKtoK* Me a 14 yo: *sings along in good music diversity*
14:05 if i get sucked in, if i get sucked in, if i get sucked in
wait- guys, i made an little edit from a snippet of this vid,, could a few of y’all maybe check it out? if not whatever idm
this is the hardest iv laughed
Nobody:    Tommy:    “Is it clementine?”
This was posted 50 something min ago so that means tommy fucking posted this at 6 something in the morning.  And I live in Canada so it’s normal for me to be awake at this time if you know what I mean
Lmao the warzone music
I was sleeping but well fuck that
I can’t wait till 6.69M xD
I love how tommy didnt even try to hide the fact that he used /locate fortress
The black hole isn't funny it's you guys                Do you know that a black hole is invincible
Bru mr beast ain’t feelin 2 good after this vis
Like if Tubbo
I'm 18 and I dont think wilbur n Charlie realise how many of us have watched Hamilton and know the songs they sang lmao
Tommy is basically just watching Dreams old videos and thinking to himself like “mhmm I think I could do that and get plenty of views from it”
Anyone going to talk about how Philza went into creative mode at 7:49 ?
It isn't the mod that makes it funny,it's the people who made it funny
He really likes the name clementine. imagine way down the line when hes 40 something and all grown up and he names his future kid *clementine*
20:23 Me, 12, Singing with them: 💃
I don’t get it lol it’s not really funny
O_O
Flash back to when Dream did this.
8:39 **spagettified**
Any one see Tommy put philza in creative. At 7.50
Am I the only one who saw tommyinnit use the locate command😂😂😂
is it bad that even as a 2006 kid I got all the references they made
Me to
wilbur: what won't tommy's audience understand? charlie: *references jet pack joyride* me: you fool, you absolute buffoon-
WILBUR WE ARENT THAT YOUNG WTF THOSE SONGS ARE OUR CHILDHOODS OK
Ummm boats
tommyinnit with a RTX 3090 at render distance 5 POG
POGGGGGGGG
Im 14 and got 2 references
The entire time I would be screaming and running because the thought of imminent death is terrifying
this game is being played by professionals that is real
gonna recreate this irl
Wil: ya all ur subs tommy r 14 Tommy: no some r 15 18  Me whos 13: 🤦🏻‍♀️ pog thru the pain
Wilbur and cicle yelling:    -Philza Set own gamemode creative-
20:32 i know every reference and it brought back such nostalgia i just had to pause the video to process, then i got hit with the 'make me stronger' twice as hard... im 14... edit: more nostalgia edit 2: ...BELIEVING HOLD ON TO THAT FEELING
"Enjoy this video" Is that a command or a suggestion.
"With the taste of your lips I'm on a riiiiiide" I get that reference >:)
Philza with persona music be lit in hell.
I don’t know why but i watch tommy for about 4 months now and i am so proud of him for how far he has come on such a young age.
who else got most of the songs Wilber and Slimecicle were singing
Pogchamp
The child has discovered ads.
Dr. Cicle: that’s my level 9 ice wizard for ya  Me: wait, isn’t that default lev-
I’m 12 and I got all the references
Maybe you could have one of y'all as a black hole like the dragon
THICC BLACK HOLE
First
Why did I know all the songs charlie and wilbur were singing?
1 HOUR LATE FU*K
“I was in the forest just looking for some tasty mud.” Me: that seems familiar... Sand Video: *exists* Me: Ah-...
U look like Gordon Ramsay
At this rate, Tommy would have a diamond play button in 2-4 months time. Mark my words
hey tommy lets be besties
Charlie and Wilbur: trying to songs that 14 year olds can’t understand.  Me being 14: Knows all the songs.
Me: *sings toxic and all the other songs they sing with them * the times stamp is 29:34 for those who are wondering
0:25 how do you wanna die?
Boat
Nobody Me:* remembers karmaland's 4 blackhole * xD
Alternative title: Me and my friends disappearing like my dad.
20:45 Why is Charlie saying singing Eliza and Peggy from Hamilton so on point
JOKES ON THEM.... I know most of those songs
"I'ma goin in a black hole" -Charlie 2021
Me born in 2007 and know every reference that wilbur made.....
:)😀
I love how Philza is just making fun of Tommy’s titles the entire time
Ee
Im 13, I understand the references though so ha.
5:01 I don't think the white girls on Twitter agree with that
looks scary!!!!!!
Low key honestly spaghettification is *H I L A R I O U S*
Charlie’s death before he got to the end has to be more heartbreaking than the entire plot of the DreamSMP
This is VERY F U N N Y
EPIC
Tommy:there not all 14 they could be 16 and 18   Me:umm I’m 9 lol
Me rewatching to find Wilburs Clash name
Alternate title: Local british child and his friends are eaten perpetually by a small black orb for 22 minutes and 55 seconds
I like how he says finally when they’ve been doing pretty well in them recently
Theres 10 year olds watching your video
Of course he posted at 4:20 pm
Lol
its scary how just a few weeks ago he was at like 4.8 million subs
Tommy.. why are u uploading at 11pm? I mean I may not have school tomorrow but still...
as someone who was born in 2005, was i not supposed to know those songs?
When tommy does /locate fortress
you should get dream in one of these lol. to see if he can like, speedrun through these dangerous mods
Tommy squad assemble
Finnaly you have been talking about this all of the past streams
Every video Tommy, is closer to his next subscriber Milestone
was that a hamilton reference !
Plot twist wilbur opening the void in the lazar mod created a black hole.
Bruh Wilbur and Charlie are over here singing songs that I know and I'm 13
From wars to messing around with mods
That's very small for black hole I see black holes that's bigger than Stars
The latin text approximately translates to "damnation in latin. This is true in latin." The grammar's a bit wonky but the editor probably spent their time learning a real language
i remember when dream was almost at 7 million ❤️
I didnt realise he uploads at liiterally 11 o clock -_-
Me encanto el final xd
WHEN TOMMYINNIT UPLOADS: clicks faster than ur mom left you
bro u channel is growing so much
i’m obsessed with these videos
13:14 all the way up till slimecicle dies would be an amazing like little animation-
Who else noticed that at 7:52 Tommy set philza's game mode to creativd
Charlie just moon walked his way into that black hole
pog
hah wilbur is on arena 11 on clash royale and im arena 12 so im better than wilbur soot st something 😎👍

I remember seeing this mod on Reddit... damn
Can all of the *disgusting* bots shut up, Tommy is a *minor* god dammit
Wilbur I was born in 2009 and I knew every single one of those songs
Nice
Clash of tommy
15:08 TommyInnit on the Battle of the bridge SMPEarth
well. they made it further than dream
Wilber always seems to start a cult in these videos.
Wilbur and Charlie singing old songs that Tommy's followers won't understand cause we're young:  me(12):With the taste of ur lips I'm on a RIIIIIIDE
Remember in a Dream's video about black hole George said he is getting sucked
PilZa was cheating with creative mode
"hey charlie" "how do you wanna die?"  This is the content I subbed for?    *lip smack* perfect.
New lyrics of smooth criminal ima go into the black hole
Oh god- this whole video-
mrbeast is going to commet on this video
Tommy is gonna overtake vikkstar
The scariest thing about this mod is that the black hole is round
not wilby thinking we don’t know kesha and britney-
54 mins ago

K

I’m Impressed by the Many Bots in the Comments Of the comments
Ah yes, MrBeast, King of Hell
I understood everydingle referance and im 14
10:10 the subtitles broken =P
MrBeast wouldn't use a million dollar golden whip alone; he'd challenge his fans to cause the most pain with four of them for 100k.
“I can’t even see it”  *lightning menacingly flashes revealing their impending doom* Tommy: *Yelling*
I know all the songs Wilbur and Charlie sang 😂
Slime as Michael Jackson is wonderful

Maybe Tommy learnt a couple video ideas or two whilst hes in prison with Dream?
I cant wait till tommy is old enough to go on love or host
I liked the part where Tommy jumps in the portal THE MOMENT the black hole gets there. Something out of a movie.
“very funny” ah yes tommy, being sucked into the black hole of the universe is *very funny.*

POG IN CHAT
Wilbur grows closer and closer to insanity everyday <3
I like how Wilbur and Charlie tried to make song references that we wouldn’t get, yet they somehow sang all of our childhood songs😂
20:39 A R O U N D T H E W O R L D
I dont find you annoying sooo... *Subscribes*
I’m a proud subscriber... and you should too.

When Tommy said shack, I half expected him to say I'm Shaq'ing off, and start screaming about 'THOSE FUCKING HOOPS'
Wilbur: “I’ve seen into the blacked eye of the event horizon” The viewers: *ah shit, here we go again*
Everyone: *joking about it’s the funnies mod ever*  Tommy: Fine, take this then  Edit: Replies sus, do NOT click on them

Fun fact : this is the first time i've seen a tommyinnit video in 1080p and i've seen alot
“we finally beat a challenge” u already did
It's a giant black balloon!
Tommy's definition of content is to make a video called the funniest mine craft video ever and put a picture of him screaming in the thumbnail
At around 1:00 why was slime's talking purple rather than the usual green?
Tommy: Phil I don’t like black holes, that’s one of the two things I’m scared of Me: is the other thing you’re scared of women?
Am I the only one that got the references that wilbur and charlie were making?
I dont like clash royale its only for simps i play clash of clans its for cool boys only

The moment I heard a robotic voice say "PANCAKES" I knew he was playing clash royale

*so there was a man walking with a young boy in the woods* Boy:Hey "mister im getting scared" Man "how do you think i feel i have to walk back alone"
The meaning of funny is tommyinnit
In Congress, July 4, 1776  The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.  He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.  He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.  He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.  He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.  He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.  He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.  He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.  He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.  He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.  He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.  He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.  He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.  He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:  For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:  For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:  For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:  For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:  For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:  For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences  For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:  For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:  For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.  He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.  He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.  He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.  He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.  He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.  In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.  Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

Tommy is hitting on a polar bear
Philza being a Persona MC in the Nether
YESSS NEW VIDEO
I don’t think Charlie and Wilbur understand that 14 year olds still get those references.
21:47 - 22:00 could make for a GREAT animatic ngl
This feels like Dream And George And Sapnap escaping the black all over again
pog
Its a black whole tommy not a moth you can't call it clementine
I’m watching Tommy as I have a little Tommy shimeji running around on my screen
big rip at the end
Evry time I watch your videos hoping for a new on you post how

It was more intense than all of Dreams manhunts Jesus, especially in the end /hj
As a fifteen year old I was not mentioned in regards to tommy's fans, and can therefore understand these references.  YOU'RE TOXIC IM SLIPPIN UNDER, THE TASTE OF A POISON _PARADIIIIIIIIIISE_

Posted: an hour ago Almost: 500k views

THE FUCKING CINEMATIC-LIKE SHIT WITH WILL AND CHARLIE IS INSANE AND IS OVERRATED.
the 3 roleplayers and their dad
Tommy, Wilbur and Charlie chilling in boats while Phil takes on a palace that looks like he🏒🏒
Thanks Tommy, I had to put my dog down today and this video made me laugh and put a smile on my face
wilburs backward thing normaly is: bamnation latine hoc est verum latine and translated from latin: this is true latin latin bamnation XDD
I found him annoying but still suscribed :)
Wilbur and Charlie making obscure references so the 14 old fans can’t understand:me understanding every single one and being born in 2006 *uH*
Flying Philza
im kinda quick but wasted
it reminds of the wither boss form mc story mode
Karl and my beast were in this without knowing
I’m 11 and I got all the references Wilbur and charlie made
Jokes on you Wilbur, my mom only had me listen to early 2000s music. I understand and know every music reference you made >:)
I’m 13 and I knew all the songs they were singing
i though Tommy said black hoe
how do I get famous tho?
rip quackity
Hi tommy how's collage even tho ur a child :)
Thank you for adding captions!
Did anyone realise Tommy went in creative
Do the flash mod next
I can’t even see it....AAAAAAAAAAAAAA   -tommy
hi
Tommy next Einstein?
.
Pov: you can't come up with a original comment
Philza is so old
stop uploading mods please go back to normal 😭😭😭😭
Tommy i just noticed that you use the same facecam photo for almost every thumbnail
Hi!
Dream copy
I get all the references and im 17
When u realise they cheated on their least funny vid
Cool
this is way better then p- nvm
Thanks for ruining my sleep schedule for like the millionth time
this was uploaded on my birthday...
bruh tommy is gaining so fast like last week he hit 6mil
Wilber I got every single reference you made and I’m younger than 14 ....
Hehehe
Here before 1 mil
Am I the only one that reads the titles with a British accent?
POV: You're over 16 and very upset.
Pog
20:05 literally looked like a horror film with that timing
Bitch I'm early
If you notice closely even the villagers are trying to run
imagine he gets cancelled for saying i dont like black holes
7:54 [philza set self gamemode to creative]
This vid has made my day cheers bro 😎
Gg no re
The songs they were singing for the 14yo I'm 14 and I know all of them their all good songs
E
Half the comments are about to be dream already did this.
Friends of mine were talking about u guys but HE is not my friend anymore...
Philza is the only one who actually plays the game
am the only one that knows what will and charlie were singing about xD
Hi
i remember tommy hitting 5 mil like, really recently, what is happening
Wow I’m early
Just realized Tommy  said I spotted that with my ears 11:49
Wilbur and Charlie having no idea what 18-16 year olds grew up with lmaoo. We grew up with all the songs their singing I think their thinking of 14-10 year olds
pause at 21:24 😳😳
No one:  Tommy: I'm friends with mrbeast
14:24 anyone else see the chat?
20:01 that was so cinematic
When I get all their references 👩‍🦲I’m 12
Neil
Dream already did this tommy. Dumb child
Alternate title the tommyinnit channel is very funny
When you think ur special cuz u were 36 minutes early but then remember that 36 minutes is a long time and Tommy is popular
Pls play more origins smp it’s so fun to watch on the tube
Tommy back with the original titles
TommyInnit’s titles be like: The nazi mod is actually funny
I came for funnies, not existential dread
wilbur has a tendency to drop banger lines like “i’ve seen into the blackened eye of the event horizon. there is no screams. i called to the stars and they laughed at me”  but then he dies to see if a fucking egg will get pulled into the black hole
jokes on wilbur i knew all those references cause my mom listens to old music
Lesson of the day: Don’t heehee near a blackhole
phil coming in clutch with the P5 style nether trades-
Why do i hear boss music?
every time I check he is 1 tenth of a mil more than the video
who else saw philza go into creative mode 7:51
Am I the only one that has noticed that Tommy really likes the name Clementine??
Who is German?😂
Charlie trying to tempt them in made me think of When Day Breaks.
This will get on trending
nice
This is some pog
If only I could turn down my render distance and neverhave to see corona
Never joke about my clash base getting raided
Up the 18 year old fans!
I heard just cause 3 music in there and instantly recognized it
Wilbur: Tommy’s audience won’t understand these references  Me born in 2005: singing along
why does wilbur think tommy’s whole fanbase is six year olds PAHAH
Some are 14 16 18 I am 10 and I watch youe vids
I was about to say ur near 7 mil but you said it in the same time
Hi
yayy im early
Alternate title:  a child an old man a guy who hates the child and a guy named charlie teach 6million people about blackholes
OMG TOMMY INNIT

9:21 Wilbur: Don’t say that I will cry Mr.Beast: What? Wilbur: What?
First of all, black holes attract like any other object in the universe (besides exotic matter), not suck like a vacuum. . Second, black holes are not black; they glow because of Hawking Radiation. Third, a black hole of that size would reach the critical point where it would instantly decay by Hawking Radiation because when black holes get smaller they emit more Hawking Radiation, so this would explode in a Kilanova explosion sending trillions of pounds of matter outwards. The singularity (A point in space where space-time curvature becomes infinite) would decay as it is not protected by an Event Horizon (The outer layer of a black hole which once something goes in, it never can ever come out according to general relativity). Just your average person who watches Tommyinnit
3 wow
Philza's music while bartering tho!!!!!
I understood all wilbur and slimes references if anything you called more of us
Yeeeee
Lol Wilbur is like Rick and Slimecicle like Morty
DUDE that scene where you couldnt see it then suddenly lightning struck was sooo crazy
Not gonna lie but I think Tommy will reach 10million sub this year
You should do something where it involves your viewers, Like a country made up of your viewers and they'll wage war with Wilbur's Country also made up by his viewers.
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride You're toxic, I'm slippin' under With a taste of a poison paradise I'm addicted to you Don't you know that you're toxic? And I love what you do Don't you know that you're toxic? Don't you know that you're toxic?
I’m 15 and I understood all of those songs CAUSE THEIR A BOP
I love these videos so much dude
When they were talking bout Tommy’s fans being 14 and over I’m younger and I understood EVERYTHING 😂😂
when youtubers run out of ideas :
wow wilbur is always doing something weird
Am I the only one that got 8 ADS IN THIS VIDEO
14:25 tommy uses cheats
Next episode, Phils just going to see the next mod and just go, "Fuck you guys, I'm going to get netherite"
Im eleven and i got the first one- Never mind i know all of them
Tommy's subtitles : - -     SO FUNNY               O
Idk what the first Latin thing was but the 2nd one was we are beggars this is true
14:28 Wtf Tommy an RTX 3090!!!
He was long then he was gone said my mom
Bet u wont reply
Congrats for coming early and seeing this
WILL POWER!?!? THERE'S FUCKING PERSONA MUSIC IN A TOMMYINNIT VIDEO
Funny enough I was born in 2006 and knew each song they sang
more intense then manhunt at the end ngl
I LOVE TOMMY
I love how Wilbur always starts some kind of weird cult or something completely irrelevant to the actual objective of the game in every single one of these.
"He got long then we was gone. He got wide then he died" My favorite quotw
21:22 That looks pretty familiar...It reminds me of what the ghost has seen in the OriginSMP
“WE GOTTA WUN”  :TommyInnt 2021
, \ \
18:09 when u r on a streak in fps games
Also some of us are 11/12-
Does Charlie not realize that to be a doctor you need to go to school for at least 10 years?? I've got a feeling he's not a real doctor....
I'm 20....I'm older than the normal tommy watcher?
The editor spelled omelet wrong 14:30 I’m not trying to be rude I was just noticing it
Born in 2009 got all references
Glitch: IF i get sucked in,
Someone was very tired when they we're doing the subtittles today
The edited-in subtitles randomly being wrong somehow made this even funnier 💀
Anyone see that slime changed his gamemode
As a teen, I understood all the references
You better sub to Tommy
the lightning revealing the black hole is genuinely terrifying
Philza does things unsuspecting persona 5 fans what do I hear in the distance.
That's intense
Its so funny
Me sitting here a 14 yr old knowing all of Wilbur and Charlie's "obscure" references like 👁️👄👁️
20:55   "we gotta wun"
Do a face reveal at 10 million subs
hi
First hour gang:
Very funny
Philza in the nether is just too intense
Y e s
I know all of those songs and I was born in 2008
i genuinely only just realised they cheat these videos
I swear that the name of all of Tommy’s videos lately have been:  Minecraft’s (Name of Mod) is the funniest thing ever!
Is it me or every episode Phil always leaves everyone behind and he ends up getting diamonds?
Tommy just made Dream's video but even more funny 🤣🤣
I subscribed.          Just saying.

20:06 hola crap that was ominous
It doesn't look Very Funny, it looks TERRIFYING.
Tommy just /located the nether fortress at 14:24 😂

Tommy vs Grian?     Also black holes are one of my worst nightmares before including the dark era of the universe
If you found this  Then your 48 minutes late
Who else think 20:07 was EXACTLY like a horror movie 🎥 ☠️
Will and Charlie are like secondary English making cults
Me who got both of their references and im younger then 14:
Hey hey Tommy I'm your fan I use tlauncher using ur skin

7 MIL???? ALREADY????? GG MAN!!
I'm not even 14 but I got all of these references and that kills me. Stronger and TiKToK were the best references.
Charlie and Wilbur: *Making references* Me: *being 15 and understanding all of them*
Phil: Gangster Kid
Jesus, why are there so many bots here?
Thats really cool tommyinnit
/gamerule commandblockoutput disabled, please

Now he’s Moddyinnit.
I like the warthog halo run music
Ok
Just as I like it Slimecicle and Wilbur are trying to get a chicken to lay an egg And Tommy and Phil are running away from the black hole
Hello tommy ive been a fan since 145k subs nice to know your going up in the ranks
I knew almost all the songs Wilbur and slime were singing and I’m 15-
I understood every reference and I loved it
POV UR EARLY
im still wondering where quackity went
Bro That ending where thet jumped into the Portal was clutch.
bold to assume us 15 year olds don’t know toxic. very bold wilbur
Lol early?!?!?!?!?!?
PLS WHEN CHARLIE AND WILBUR STARTED SINGING THOSE SONGS MY JAW LITERALLY DROPPED I GOT THROWN BACK TO 2018 SO HARD
Welcome to the life of an adult child🤣😂
When the 16 year old child makes more than both his parents yearly salary
Id rather watch this than do my homework, thank you tommy
dude all of the references that wil and slime made i knew
LOL
Anyone else hear the modern warfare lobby music when slimecicle was in the minecart
4:28
Ey support tommy for 7m subscriber
Wilbur and Charlie singing 2000 hits and not expecting Tommy’s Fan base to k ow them is so amusing to me
first
I made it I commented before 1h I made it woohooo!
creative mode
"Tommys entire audience is 14 so they wont get these refrences" i got every refrence wilbur needs to stop being a boomer
Yes
Philza carried
Even though Wilbur's references were targeted to make 14 year olds confused, I must confess that I understood every single one.
17:56 𝑨𝒏𝒅 𝒂𝒇𝒕𝒆𝒓 🤣
sorry wilbur but i actually do know who kesha is thanks
a *chewtorial*
wilbur and slime getting sucked into a black hole mean while Phil is in creative mode 7:54

"In the beginning, there was nothing. And then Mr. Beast said: "TODAY GUYS WERE GOING TO BE SURPRISING ONE LUCKY SUBSCRIBER WITH A PLANET! and there was light."
Gginnit
Anyone noticed that at 4:46, slime and wilburs' subtitle colour changed...
Tommy you probably won’t see this but I have been watching since you had 300 thousand subs and I have love your content so much yes I haven’t see every video but when I watch one of your vids I laugh so much you are such a good YouTuber

I actually got all of their song references
17:26 nice persona 5 misic there
he took 'inspiration' from green blob
help my dad swalowed my brother with his black hole
Who’s under 14 and knew all the songs Wilbur and slimecicle were singing
when you break it down this video is about four men trying to survive in the wilderness with an endgoal of killing a fucking dragon in another dimension while constantly be chased by a circle of hell
You should probably ask Mr.beast if he is okay with you saying that
Tommyinnit.
Congrats to Everyone who is early and found this comment👑

yknow I feel offended that wilbur and slimecicle didn't think we'd know some of the most iconic songs of the early 2000s
Wilbur and Charlie becoming mad scientist lol
This video is literally just a MrBeast advertisement
Tommy: Does a mod video    Wilbur: 𝗗𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗱𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗰

21:17 and onward was honestly fucking terrifying   I really want to see an animatic of it now
I knew every reference Wilbur and Charlie made about the songs and I'm 15😂😂😂
2006 and i knew every song and i am way too proud of it
“Not all of them are 14”
20:34 I’m 15 and got that reference, so suck it Wilbur.
14:11 IF i get sucked in is what he siad btw
Tommy I’m ur biggest fan

"When how the" TommyInnit -2021
7:53 did anyone else see that tommy set philzas gamemode to creative
I'm am 12 idiots
21:12 *flashbacks*
I like the avaritia mod it's a armor and weapon on and there are other really cool mods like it and there are multiple tnt mods but Idk which has the world buster tnt and half the time it breaks your game so people think that's is what it does
Education Edition: On
who else actually knows what all of them songs that charlie and wilbur where singing are?
Before tommy says it just give him likes on twitter 👯‍♀️
i dont care about the people who say your annoying, you make really funny videos and i loved the terraria one, terraria is my favorite game, i have 2000+ hours of it, so keep on making videos.
Ahhh
Wilbur and charlie were making references of stuff that literally shaped my childhood and im 13
nice, persona 5 music
"JIIIIIIIMMMMMMMIYYYYYY"    -Tommyinnit
I like how u can see that Wilbur set himself it creative mode
My mom when she see my grades 21:15

20:56 tommy uwu voice
I hope tommy does a I Minecraft's cursed mod is very cursed
Arent black holes suppose to reduce in size after it sucks on something
Imagine being in the lighting arena cringe
47 minutes POGGG!!
Holy shit
GUESS WHAT F*CKERS I KNEW 3 SONGS AND I ALREADY WATCH HAMILTON (this goes to when Slime and Wilbur tried to make jokes that 14+ wouldn't understand)
Trying to find some tasty mud- TommyInnit
3
Everyone stop subscribing at 6.999m subs
Lol Wilber and Charlie trying to sing songs to confuse the viewers and I was just jamming along with them like-
“install tinder illegally” what
Tommy stop telling me to unsubscribe
Ig im early
Now that was Very Funny
Tommy more like Captain America
Tommy has more American Subs than he has other countries
*MR BEAST, GIVER OF ALL THINGS, GOOD AND BAD...*
Lol
Last time I was this early, my dad wasn’t gone      (Btw this is a joke for peeps who didn’t get the joke.)
20:06 such a manly scream
Tbh it kinda sad that wibur and charlie think that 14 yr olds dont know these songs 20:30
I like how whenever Tommy says Clementine like ever, his voice goes all soft. Lmao
i didn't expect to hear persona music in a tommy innit video
Tommy after beating a challenge for the 10th time: WE *FINALLY* BEAT A CHALLENGE!!1!1!!!
Hey
Mr beast is not going to like this
19:99 when the lightning struck it was like a horror movie and the music just toke to a whole new level
Be Honest Before you clicked this video do you guys expect the gang to make a shit ton of butt jokes
Tommy is a stud
i do miss big Q tho
"I SPOTTED THAT WITH MY EARS"  same
14:10 the subtitles seem to be off   Also I understood all of the references they made them very obvious
16:47 you can always count on Philza to have 3 stacks of gold
7:11 This is true in Latin  Sentence in Latin
I understood the song that wilbur and charile sang and I'm 13
Did anyone see that Tommy set Phil to creative anyways this is so funny 😂
CLEMENTINE??? IS THE MOTH A BLACK WHOLE NOW??? DO I NEED TO MAKE A GOTH MOTH GIRLFRIEND FOR TOMMY NOW?? Probably not
Tommy put 8 fucking ads on a 23 minute video. Bruh.
this is much better than studying for my math test
lol i just notied that they are playing in the same map/seed of their modded smp
had to turn my volume down to 5 for this video
At this time tommy has more subs than techno      Wow
Surprised how they found the end
"It looks like were moon walking"
18:24 tommy and wilbur missed a joke there
You know they said something bad when the editor has to censor a word in a tommy in it video
Where’s the video where you played with DanTDM?
I had a stroke reading the last paragraph of the description
Quackity > Slimecicle
daft punk reference :|
if I see a comment saying first imma rage
Philza goes off camera for a second  *comes back and has 3 stacks of gold*
4:39 is where the subtitles switched colors
Wooooo
“Is it called clementine or Terrence”  What’s Tommy’s obsession with clementine, I ain’t complaining. I like the beams clementine lmao
At this point the main reason I watch these vids is to see what cult Wilbur starts
So now tommy is a funny child who messes with giant unknown death orbs
Just change man
17:34 WILL POWER
Vids sorry
My guy tommyinnit has been growing insanely fast I’ve been with him since 1,500,000 about

How to make a TommyInnit title:____ mod is THE funniest mod
Most of your videos contain the word funny in the title. Mostly at the end of the title (The last word in the title)
Hi tommy i love tou tik toks abd yt bids ur so good!

Hi i have trypophobia
Let's all be honest, who knew all the references Wilbur and Charlie made because I did and I was born in 2007.

When the lightning reveals the black hole just scared the shit outta be

I liked the video- it's very funny and I love stuff like this!
All of the references from Charlie and Wilber I understood so make them harder next time
I'm 16 and knew every one of those references 🙃
Honestly I would love to be a nerd if you want reasons then here.  1: You can get a good job 2: You can live a easy life 3: You might be like bill gates.

Why is it that in all of these videos Wilbur starts doing something weird with animals?
I subbed
Yaaaay Tommy got to love absolutely nothing cause he doesn’t reply 👏
Every single one of these mod videos is just charlie and wilbur being chaotic with tommy just being stressed while phil beats the game.
I haven't watched the video yet but I assume a religion is made around the blackhole
No one: Them: WITH THE TASTE OF IR LIPS IM ON A RIDE YOUR TOXIC IM SLIPPING UNDER

The fact that Charlie and Wilbur were making 2000s song references gave me life

7:56 [TommyInnit has set Ph1lZa’s mode to creative] LMAO

R we gonna ignore the phils game switch to creative 🤣
1:00 Tommy: "well I was in the forest lookin for sum tasty mud" Animators: "write that down write that down! "
Ahh omd I love these mod videos
so basically a summary of the video is: -Tommy acts like he is in a movie and plays intense music while running from the move -Phil actually gathers resources -Charlie and Wilber try becoming scientists and fail miserably    I copied this comment so give me more likes
I'm 9
🤔
How the fuck is your channel this big in 12 months of having 180k

Tommy and Phil were actually concerned while Charlie and Wilbur were just: 21:07
Uk_gang innit
19:28 wilbur is a mini pekka user ayy?
I'm five minutes into the video and have already gotten 7 ads. wtf is up with that?
Wilbur with the pass Royale tho🥰🥰🥰
I was actually expecting wilbur to make a black hole cult
Um I’m fourteen and I got all the references
So what Wilbur and Slimecicle don't know is I'm 12 and know all the songs they sang, so take that.
tommy I have no friends can u be my friend i am a woman :')
0-0 just 0-0
Hello Tommy The Child
Is that the Earthbound music in the background. The time 14:28
7:55 “Set Philza’s mode to Creative”
Not  wilbur underestimating my knowledge of music🙄✋
Black hole mod? Is it Poggers? 🤔
7:08 "Latin sentence. This is real Latin." Thank you Editor Larry for the chuckle
I would love to see this series with a full on mod pack just to see what they would get up to
FIRST        Oh, i guess. Not
Fun fact : you read this cus it has fun fact
alternate title: Doctor and mr beast fan get eaten in big spooky circle while old man teaches child how to not die
wilbur singing toxic thinking most of us dont know that song but that fool doesnt know
No one: Tommy watching 5 minute crafts: how to build an industructable shack
20:06 pure absolute panic
He gained 100,000 in 42 min
its not a mod video if wilbur doesnt make any alliance tommy doesnt make anybody laugh they dont end up destroying everything philza doesnt carries
Just so Wilbur and Charlie know I’m 13 and I knew all those songs, I am superior
7:56 Anyone notice that Tommy set Philza to creative or is that just me?
Claim Your Early Ticket Here!!! befor it gets 1m views

3:32 Phil died to a iron golem lmao
"no! I have gold trouser. Look, theyre pals—"  top 10 words before disaster
how old am i supposed to be to watch this channel
I cant breathe anymore-
Lets be honest.. Charlie carried the video

Imagine how much philzas back is hurting lol
This is a comment and you can not prove me wrong.
Nice
GET TOM THE POG MAN TO 7 MILL

THOMAS IS INSIDE OF IT HE IS IN THE BLACK HOLE OH MY GOD

Tommy be like: What other “holes” have you been in...read more
0:39 *After Wilbur said that he just automatically changed the original title*
cool
*F e e d   t h e   v o i d*
Charlie and Wilbur are just amazing😂
wilbur asking the most obscure reference they could make that all of us wouldn't get and then theres me knowing all of the reference and only being 13 ( well, 14 soon but still 13 )
Why so many ads ? 😂
I sense this video getting age-restricted..
Why did you upload this at midnight
As a 14 year old I feel insulted that wilbur wouldn't think I would know all those songs

As a half lesbian I can confirm that TommyInnit is actually pretty funny
AHHH
Their Powers: Slimecicle: has a laser eye Wilbur: is a ghost and also has laser eye Ph1Lza: Elytrist and has laser eye. Tommy: Chicken, black hole bender and has laser eye.

400k views in 40 minutes lmao
5:39 hmmm so charlie went in creative??
It's the fact that spaghettified is a scientific term
"He got long and then he was gone, he got wide and then he died" Charlie Slimecicle that was poetic
Hey
wilbur playing clash royale is the most wilbur thing ever
I'm a 12 year old viewer and I get some of those references.
this is STUPID....good!
i’m proud to say i understood all the “obscure references” as a 16 year old 😌
The mod aint funny your funny king
I just had a breakdown and this really helped me calm down :)
So nobody's gonna talk about how every video philza always finds a village?

Pog
LMFAOOOOOOOOOO
I like how at the egg throwing part you can hear halo music
As a Tommy fan and a 14 year old I understood every single reference Wilbur and Charlie made
21:21 "DONT STOP"

What do you call when philzas name and wilburs name mixed up
Fun fact: The black hole is black
what server do you use to make this vids?
Pog champ

The person who disliked is probably Mrbeast
tommy.... what do you think about Americans watching this video and smiping for you??
The Persona 5 music against Phil trading is amazing lmao
i love Charlie’s and Wilbur’s energy every video, it gives me my daily serotonin.
They used mw sound track. Nice

You give phillza creative cheater
Tommy and Charlie: chatting about cool kids or whatever you call that- Wilbur: acts like a shady, mysterious, drunk dealer-
Hi tommy
20:50 is where the fun begins
Never expected MrBeast to be the lord of hell
wilbur and slimecicle: making references they think that 14 year olds don’t get me (age 14): got every single one of then
that was so much more fun and entertaining then i thought it would be-
20:12 i love the way tommy says this lmao
so glad this was made before my birthday (28th of feb in Australia)
14:24 I saw that Tommy...
damnationem latine hoc est verum latine? wtf is wilbur speaking latin or italic or something that has conjugations
Do they think where all 2? I don’t Know one person that hasn’t heard those songs before

Wilbur can just turn anything into deep lore 😂
Charlie's shirt looks great
Why can I see Tommy is breaking out
This is pog.
tommy - /locate fortress Phil - I think i found it
My only question is...  HOW THE HELL DID WILBUR COME BACK WHEN THE BLACK HOLE WAS HUGE—
jokes on you wilbur, i knew every reference you made
5:00 Those are the best last words said by any man.
DADDY PHILZA FOREVER....
Wilbur, as a younger person i am highly disappointed that you think i don’t know those songs. what the freak man anyways
Did he really just use the Just Cause heat music
5:33 did I saw cheat 👀
Plot twist: Title changes to tommyinnit is the funniest
Imagine if this gets a shoutout
I'm glad wilber one that game of clash
Why is every mod in the entire universe funny
14:11 the text is wrong xD

3:30 you can see that philza was slain by the iron golem lol
Wilbur and Charlie trying to sing songs that Gen Z won’t understand went horribly wrong
_WAKE UP IN THE MORNIN FEELIN LIKE P DIDDY_
If Wilbur and slimesicke were my teachers I'd be happier
Praise God
Yea, sub to Tommy come on it’s EZ to press a button
7:56 tommy why is Philza in creative
Get him to 10million
>:O TOMMY YOU RIPOFF
Anyone else loving the HALO theme music?
I have no idea what to put hear but all I can say is... WILBUR IN DA BOAT
im surprised this somehow got dislikes
there's nothing rich folks love more
That ending with the portal made my heart rush holy crap. That was a lot more stressful then I anticipated... I wanna draw it.
sorry im late but hi! :D
I understood all but 1 reference Wilbur and Charlie made lol
EARLY GANG 😃👏🏻
wilbur singing my childhood
20:05 I can’t even see it- i can’t even- *cue dramatic lighting* AAAAAAAAAAA
Nobody:  No one ever: Wilbur and Charlie: *IMA GET A SCHOLARSHIP TO KING'S COLLEGE*
The boys always Pog Irl when big man uploads
Pog
I happen to be 14 and know all the songs Wilbur and charlie where singing :T
I understand all those references
Not wilbur and Charlie singing songs that we won’t recognise and me knowing all of them, they didn’t even come out long ago, how young do they think we are?😂
0:55 Subtitles for charlie should have been green but it's purple
IM EARLY
In a nutshell; Everyone gets sucked into the hole...
Dream Fans : _oH My GoD iS tHaT tHe ViDeo dReaM dID?!?!?_
The new physics teacher is here...
I committed several types of homicide and it was EXTREMELY FUNNY!
If im a 14 year old when i was born in 2004 and i recognize every song they were singing, the only excuse i have is JustDance. no other reason..
The Mario Galaxy music is ever so fitting
[TommyInnit:set Ph1Lza's game mode to creative mode] i wonder what that entails
Someone's probably already said this but- The subtitles  at 7:07 ish was 'this is latin' and 'this is true in latin' in latin and mirrored. :D
21:44 Wilbur and Charlie singing Hamilton: Me: *pauses the video and finishes the song*
Hi
When your 30 mins early
Pog

Jokes on you Wilbur I knew half those references.

That ending feels like a movie's dramatic ending  with the black hole creeping into the end room and the portal lit up. Tommy just yelling "JUST JUMP" Everyone expect slime makes it in.

“That was the funniest slow painful death i’ve ever seen”

I miss Quackity 😔
Nice theses videos are always funny
“We are getting close to 7 million subscribers”  I swear we’re getting close to another million every video
Back at it again with the “Most funniest mod ever”
Wilbur: “I’ve seen inside the blackened eye of the event horizon. There were no screams. I called out to the stars, and they laughed at me.” Tommy: *”do you want to shoot hoops with us”*
Ph1lza: *Does literally everything* Tommy: We finally beat a challenge!
So it’s funny, but not hilarious?
Tommy, I recon you make use of F3 + D a bit more eh?

some of us are younger than 14. Wilbur we do know those songs. Some of us were forced to listen to them on the radio for car rides for hours on end. Im deeply offended
in 6:17 is talking and tommy says do you want to go hoops with us
Almost every funny mod video Philza: The one who is actually playing normally  Tommy: The one who is behind Philza to steal loot or To check the mentally insane ones  Slimecicle and Wilbur: The mentally insane ones who randomly come up with a weird story.

You can tell the video was slightly rushed as some of the subtitles are incorrect 😂 (Edit: fuck yeah his video is #1 TRENDING FOR GAMING)
“he is like a brother to me..”  Everyone waiting for Wilbur to say “dont say that ill cry”
NO WILBFOOT!
i actually translated the thing wilbur said and idk if a comment has said this but its says: English sentence & This is true in Latin  7:07

Being 17 and understanding all those references is nice

Wilbur and Charlie singing songs that 14 year olds don’t understand and yet me a 15 year old knew each song they sang
I love how they are making their own videos now and be coming more than the guy on the dream smp
9:22 i waited but got nothing in return 😪
They just wanted to get some copper.....
I can proudly say as a thirteen year old I got all the references Charlie and Wilbur made.

ill ditch my physics teacher for this 😫🖐
I love how Ph1lza just took care of the nether, while they were in the overworld goofing off and running from the blackhole
as a 13yr old i get every single one of those references to those songs and am proud of it
When they started singing I'm just sitting here thinking, "I know every one of those songs." How coincidental.
What a cool dude
I will never insub
Slimecicle: what your favourite jet pack joyride Tommy: shut up I’m so stressed  😥🤣😂
Tommy this is like the 10th funniest mod-
Wil: lets make references tommys subscribers won’t understand   Wil and Charlie: *sing Toxic, Tiktok, and Hamilton*  Tommys subscribers: 😑 “really?”
"I got sucked into a black hole and at the end of the world there was a great white void, and hidden in there was Mr. Beast, and he said, 'Congrats, you're the lucky subscriber!' and he gave me a Mr. Beast wrapper car and brought me back to life." -Charlie Slimecicle

wilbur and Charlie singing early 2000s bops as if Tommy’s fan base isn’t entirely made up of people who have lived through that era is hilarious to me
16:03 isn’t that the music from Just Cause 3
Rlcraft?
I CANT BREATH KABWNWWHWLEBEJE RYFFIEJENEUEBDEJBE
"Some of my viewers aren't 14, they are some 16, some 18." Me understanding everything and being 10: ExCusE mE 👁👄👁
Wilbur and Charlie singing those songs was so nostalgic 🥲
5:54
IT PULLIN THE SNOW FROM ABOVVVEEE MY FEET oh
charlie and wilbur singing hamilton for 10 minutes
2:03 “that’s what she said” **insert Michael Scott laugh here**
...the Dragon doesn't have fans she has only fans..
"oh that's-" "you're a fool" PLS-
Who said schools gonna teach us physics eh?
hey you should do 'tax evasion is stupidly funny'
Man this is epic
23 minutes
wil said 'lets make a reference tommy's fans wont understand' me: knows every reference
"You can't make spaghetti with only one noodle."
The halo theme in the background is noice.
21:28 charlie is going to creative?
im 12 and even i know the songs
This is the cure for depression.
If you found this comment subscribe tommy for to 7 million
Ay I'm so -early-
Did anyone notice that they gave Phil creative at 7:50
*halo theme intensifies*
ayyyy new vid
Tommy 2 months ago:We are close to 5 million subscribers Tommy 1month ago:We are close to 6 million subscribers Tommy some hours ago:We are close to 7 million subscribers
7 mil already???
Please shout me out and your next video
I knew that in the end something was off
*Wilbur casually playing Clash Royale while the world ends*
I love how in every video Wilbur has some traumatic experience or creates some sort of cult
I hope tommy gets more subs then dream
that persona 5 music tho
My boy Wilbur really said “Clash Of Clans Royale.” 😂😂😂
30 minutes ago
Love how Wilbur and Charlie didn’t think that Tommy’s audience would understand the Brittany and Kesha references
Hello, TommyInnit.
Alexa, play supermassive black hole by muse   *I T S     V O I D     T I M E*
all of the songs they were singing were during our time
I'm 13 and got the references
been subbed since 500k love you tommy
Fun fact: tommy has gained .01 subscribers since this has uploaded
IS THAT AN EPIC I SEE
RACIST, WHERES THE WHITE HOLE
When Wilbur and Charlie were "making references Tommy fans won't get" I was confused, why? ...Because I knew the songs
Thank you for bringing me something to watch in my I’m sleep deprived tome
Hi
Hang on, he censored cocaine and not the 98237561028 swear words in this video??
YOUR NOT ANNOYING AND CHARLIE IS FUNNY
EARLY AS FUCK HEYYYYY
ohhh dweam
Bro, I just realized from the last video... Why does Wilbur always say "stop, I will cry" when Tommy says "we're like brothers" ???
yay im kind of early hello tommy
Charlie and Wilbur: let's confuse Tommy's viewers they're all like 14, right? *Start singing toxic* Me:*sweats in knowing the song and being a kid* Wil and Charlie:*start singing hamilton songs* Me:*more sweating*
This video defines physics because from the view of a science nerd a black hole need to be at least as big as the moon to grow, any black too much smaller than that will evaporate
OH SHIT here we go again
Which clan aye??
Ok so I’m kinda early not really. If you are reading this have a good day. I usually write random stuff about my life for some reason in the comments but I can’t think of anything so have a lovely day everyone.

Charlie: "That was the funniest slow painful death I've ever seen"  Wilbur Soot: Dies instantly
Yeyys
I can't believe Phil managed to carry that
Im early ┐( ͡◉ ͜ʖ ͡◉)┌
Will there be Big Q in the next video?
He’s racking up the videos nice job for a toddler
nobody:  Philza: Grinding for Ender pearls
Phil has to be in all these videos, because if it wasn't for him they'd never beat the game
congrats you guys win a 2 challenges

He litterally went in creative mode LOL
Everyone: *starts cult and does weird shit* Philza: *plays game normally*

Wait I'm british we use meters instead of feet??
the fact he has 65k likes in 30 mins in insane
22:35 POG CHAMP
your a child
Persona Philza
Hi Tommy I love your vids
The editor isn't even trying to hide that they are cheating anymore
At 16:31 I noticed that Just Cause 3 music
*Phil just wants to finish the game while Theres Charlie, Will, and Tommy waiting for their death*
20:29 That moment when your from 2007 and you understand every joke that Wilbur and Charlie made
Nice 👍
21:14 TO BE CONTINUED
7:51 pause tommy sets phils gm to creative lmao
The thunder makes it look so menacing
has nobody noticed that the subtitles have the wrong colors throughout the video?
Tommy is very much married to the grind
Anyone else see that Tommy set phils gamemode to creative ?
"Okay I have a 3 step plan I get 10 million subscribers and the download tinder....- illegally"
POG ChaMp

I love the halo music at the end.
Early, I was gonna comment on one of your videos saying”why hasn’t dream uploaded in a while?”
Wilbur... how young do you think we are? its Brittany freaking Spears. I'm not an infant for gods sake
I loved the references thank u
True
MY NOTIFICATIONS DIDNT WORK 👹👹👹👹
This is a joke: next video 9/11 mod is very funny
top 10 saddest anime deaths
I like how tommyinnit is hesitating to  upload the Dream SMP events because he’s so behind... and his solution is to upload a mod video and say it’s hilarious but now it’s just getting boring
When Wilbur and Charlie were singing, I was literally jamming and singing along with them 😂 I feel so old now man.
darm
Tommy and the boys in every challenge: *beat the game* Also Tommy and the boys:  We finally beat a challenge

As a 14 year old i understood all of those references
IM SO EARLY

First time seeing Tommy doing video while at my country its 1:34
Corporate needs you to find the differences between the last 9 thumbnails and titles They are the same thing
I love your channel every time you upload I watch and I’m subbed
Tommy went a bit ham on the mid rolls today’s
Every time all I see is Phil just trying to beat the game in every video but Tommy aaaaaaaaa how hard does this thing suck
They really thought we wouldn’t know Toxic
o god
i sense a new comfort video to rewatch when im supposed to be doing school work
Here after watching sidemen reacts creepy video they just posted, I needed a calmer video :(
It’s so funny how they make it more obvious their cheating now
*me getting the Toxic reference at an age where most of my peers don’t get the reference*
Wilbur just aims to d!e in all of these😂
1st reference is skeppy 2nd reference is the song toxic
If you see this comment like it for good luck though 2021 to 2022
20:31         Some are 11......        ':^
WTF, I LEARNED ABOUT BLACK HOLES YESTERDAY IN SCIENCE CLASS
I love how in the demonic latin bit on the screen it says 'this is real latin' Latin, backwards
Mmm

IF PHILZA WASN’T THERE THEY WOULDN’T OF EVEN GOTTEN STONE LMAO
Why tf is Wilbur play clash royale 😂
Not me being 13 and singing along to the songs 😂
Tommy, Charlie, and Wilbur: going 1mph in a boat   Phil: Literally fucking speedrunning the entire game getting everything they need to get to the end
Slimecicle is my new science teacher yay
Honestly, having a black hole suddenly gain speed and start chasing you I’d actually fucking (terrifying) HILARIOUS
DON'T STOP! MAKE IT POP! BABY BLOW MY SPEAKERS UP!
The Hamilton reference- yEs
Yes I'm early and I never am
So this counts as physics homework... right?
Tommy and phill trying to get into the end. Charlie and Wilber “wake up in the morning feeling like p diddy”
The guys: they won't know these songs Me: the walking jukebox 🎵 :how much you wanna bet?
i hate how ik all of the songs wilbur was singing
Have I ever mentioned how much I adore Phil? XD

I love how philza is just the dad carrying them all, while the childs just screw around
“I wonder how you fly through the air with a boat?”  Welcome to the world of black holes
I see I am 30 mins late
When you realize tommy is one day going to run out of mods...
My daughter made me subscribe to you.  She has become your minion.  I have lost all authority.
Hey what deck is wilbur using?? XD LMAO
I hate how when I saw the black hole I went “oh look it’s the Earth’s massive tumour”
I know all the songs they sang
so basically a summary of this video is: -Tommy acts like he is in a movie and plays intense music while running from the moving black hole -Phil actually gathers resources  -Charlie and Wil become scientist and fail miserably
fear black hole is
This was a whole movie I loved it
Woah
yes I am
Toooooooooooooooooooooooommy
Hehehe
Yo what the hell is going on, I just watched a 30 minute video about blackholes and 2 minutes after Tommy uploads a block hole mod video???
I'm really young and I got all those reference's
Every one playing clash of clans and then you just see Philz  speed running
2:34 OMG IS TOMMYINNIT RACIST?!?!? HE ONLY LIKES WHITE HOLES?!?!?!

tommy screamed like a woman XD
The backward message Wilbur is saying is actually "damnationem latine hoc est verum latine" which is Latin for "English sentence that is true in Latin". Thank you google translate!
-Your toxic I’m slipping under
I understood every reference. I am 14, they underestimated my mums raising abilities

Jokes on you Wilbur Soot. I knew all of those references!
0:08 your a wizard Harry
Everyone: *About* *to* *die*  Wilbur and Charlie: IMA GET A SCHOLARSHIP TO KINGS COLLEGE
This video is pog
As always, Charlie and Will instantly go off to do their own thing, while Phil does everything else and Tommy bothers him.
How the f**k did Wilbur guess my age...
Who’s here before he hits 7 mil!
when you actually are 14 but you get and love every reference they made 😂
"Phil where are you we gotta wun"
Tommy notice me🙄😫

i know both of those songs...
Uhh guys... I found something bad... IM 25 MINS LATE (;´༎ຶٹ༎ຶ`) sorry I’m being dramatic lol but still I wanna watch these as soon as possible ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ
I understood every reference Charlie And Wilbur made and im 14
That halo music fit so well there
So what number are we on where he has     it was so funny/hilarius in his title
Imagine if Charlie Damelio and Charli (Slimecicle) where playing together and then Tommy says "hello Charlie" the two of them will turn around the same time xD

Early
omg tommy is growing so fast, congrats dude!
wilbur and charlie: *trying to make references tommy's viewers wont understand* me: *singing along with them*
Wilbur and Charlie singing all those old songs, made me feel wayyy too nostalgic. Glad to know I grew up with the great music. the 2000's (before 2010) were amazing.
How dare wilbur sing toxic as if i wouldnt know it >:O
Why is wilber the only 1 that dies in the intros in these mod videos?
how the turn tables, will, i'm 13 and i understood all of the 'obscure' references you and charlie made  L
in the intro he said  black hole like no duree
i guess this is how i feels to die?
Tommy’s content in these videos has just become Wilbur and Charlie losing all sanity

The clash references had me dying.
A black hole is destroying the planet and there is no hope for humanity  Phil: I'm going to get diamonds!
7:07   damnationem latine = 'english sentence'  hoc est verum latine = 'this is truly latin'
When ur 14 and get the “obscure” references Wilbur and Charlie are making....

Thats intense
POGGGG

And on this week of "Minecraft's _________ Mod is Very Funny" today's guest is *Black Hole*
I'm sure someone will animate that scene of them just barely making into the portal, so much potential
Guess you can say this video pulled a lot of views.
Early

a black hole of that size probably would collapse gravity
The 100K Bois don't even look OG now lol I mean like 6.5 mil in a year wtaf Hope you do well tommy

зачем я его смотрю в 3 часа ночи?)
Me: Oooo he's high definition Also me: *looks closer* OH SHIT HE HAS BLUE EYES!
Charlie’s way of avoiding the black hole is one of the best ways to avoid your problems
I was in the middle of a test but this is way better
Hilarous
Hey Tommy
Does anyone care about the toxic by Britney Spears reference?
playing the videogame
Tomminnit exposed He dont like black Holes it's one Of The Things He Hates so I'm Guessing the other thing is Black People🤣
i love how Wilbur and Slime just play off of each other's improv bits, they mesh together so well
male chickens don't exist.
lovw ur vids tommy❤❤❤
I never thought I'd see the day that Tommy uses the song Will Power from persona 5
Yaaass
O god if mrbeast sees this o nononono
This is a awesome vid
I've never been more happy to opne YouTube!!
12,372th ha idiots
While philza is beating the game in 0.123233898 seconds, Tommy is yelling and being stressed out and Slimcicle and Wilbur are scientists :D
💞
Where's quackity
Wait, A circle in Minecaft?! THAT'S ILLEGAL
When there’s a black hole chasing after everyone.. Tommy: Let’s go do basketball and drugs”
Play in 2 speed just because....
I recognized all the songs Wilbur and Charlie Slimecicle sang and I really was fourteen
Will trying to make obscure reference that aren't obscure
Philza being the only reason they survive 😂
Upload dream smp
I took a shit while I watched this
I just noticed why charlie slimcicle replaced quackity
wow, philza coming in CLUTCH
Tommy playing Will Power in the background is pog
HA HA JOKES ON YOU WILBUR I LOVE BRITNEY SPEARS
Ok so I’m your teacher and black holes have no suck until you reach the event horizon and the closer you get to the singularity the more gravity pulls space and time
Am I the only one who knew all the music references at 14?
The amount of “THATS WHAT SHE SAID” jokes that were missed 🤦🏼😂
When they made all the jokes in the video so you can’t comment anything funny
Creative
Noice stonks
-currently in sending to my brother-
Drugs- mMmmmMMmm
18:14 tommyinnit singlehandedly solves climate change
.
imagine if mrbeast comments
„Why is no one that stressed like me?“
Y did the editor only bleep out f*ck when Tommy said it?
my favorite part was when wilbur soot appealed to the 14 year old audience with the hit song Toxic by Britney Spears
Petition to refer to TommyInnit's mother as "MommyInnit"
When I got the “taste of your lips reference” Take that Wilbur
Woohoo Philza didn't die!
Eventually, he died at the end of the video
"Go speak to Karl Jacobs, bitch!" ---Tommyinit
When you're 13 and got all the references that wilbur and Charlie were making
Imagine staying up so late to see this vid. Couldn't be me
It would have to been amazing in tensed animation
When you knew all the songs that Wilbur and Charlie were singing: 🧍
Me early lol haha
not all tommy fans are 14      im 15
no one:  literally not a single soul:  Charlie: lets just row with it...
Why does Phil always do everything lol
Bro tommy was at 500k like yesterday good for him
Mhm interesting 🤔 aha! SCIENCE! Yeahh
I would like to see ALL the references Charlie and Wilbur make 😌
6:54 mr beast be like: good ideia
Rip for Wilbur for dying so many times.
Wilbur logic: 14 year olds dont know Britney og Kesha Hehe
Wilburs happiness when he wins in clash of clans is what I need in my life.
10:08 wilbur sets mode to survival in chat lol
Tommy beat game with the black hole mod something dream couldn’t do. TommyInnit is the best minecrafter confirmed
As MrBeast said: "English sentence, this is true in Latin."
This is funny. I want thus mod
Tommy: look at this obsidian phil its the strongest block in the game Bedrock: 👁💧👄💧👁
I got the refrences they made, I was born in 2007
Tommy be like: finally we survived !! later... jumps into portal* „F*CK AHHHHH
Wilbur: dies Tommy: He was like a father to me Pewdiepie fans:
Piss Pants.
wilbur and charlie knows whats up with the music
not me being a 14 year old tommy fan but understanding all the refrences

Tommyinnit playing Persona Music pog 18:01
wilbur: tries to make references that 14 year olds won’t understand  every single 14 year old girl: ...wilbur we aren’t *THAT* uncultured-
This made me laugh 😂😂

i saw it coming
✔️
the modern warfare music got me lmao
Wildly got sink
This video came out 30 mins ago and in less than half an hour he’s got 100k subs
They still cheated less than I do when I play survival
According to google translate 7:07 is: "English sentence: "This is true in latin"
Yay I'm early :D
i think i am a black hole
The fact that the first song that Wilbur thought 14 year olds didn’t know was Toxic by The Britney Spears is just not poggers
me gusta hole
YAY I'M EARLY
is no one is going to mention that there was music from halo 3 in there??
Tommy: OHH! THE BLACK HOLE IS PULLING ME! *Yes, that's what they do*
When tommy says ohhhh you know it's about to go down
O
Did anyone else know all the songs that wilbur and charlie were referring too lmao
somethings wrong, he didnt call himself annoying

He protect He attack But most importantly...      He jump in the Cadillac
My favourite kind of vids
surprised they didn't make any hole jokes
Haha I love how phil just carries them while the three of them are just messing around
epic
Tommy went full newt mode at the end  "Please phil please"
c: hello im watching philza

Poggers

Tik Tok by Ke$ha made my childhood and it’s foolish and naive for Dr. Soot and Cicle to believe otherwise
Idk man there's a lot of women here
I didn't get any of those references
Mr beast 666 thousand
Yhhnnhhhhu

👌
7:52
Wait....I'm 14.....

Little did Wilbur know that a 15 year old would understand all of his references. I’m a genius.
philza uses crearive mode
Indonesian Sirrrrrrrr Halo halo Valo?
Willbur, Tommy and charlie just swimming in the boats    Philza *speedrunning*
The black whole is like the dream smp lore, you're sucked in and you can get out

Philza beating the game,mean while everyone screaming

I don’t appreciate the fact wilbur dosnt think us 14-17 year olds know music
Didn’t even realize I was early what’s up comment section
When I just come here but don’t know what to say anythiny
I love how Will just casually plays Clash Royale until he slowly dies in the black hole 😂
MrSatin
Everyone after Tommy's intro didn't contain the word "annoying"
Slime and will in the laser eye video:  Middle school bullies Slime and will in the morph mod: *BEE* Slime and will in the lava ravine mod: Star crossed chesticuff rivals Slime and will in this video:
totally haven’t created multiple accounts purely to only subscribe to tommy so he can reach as many subs as he wants :)
tommy why doesn’t you have not no merch?
U need a cut XD
Anyone else notice the Just Cause 3 music in the background?
This is one of the better edited tommyinnit videos
Damn 200k views in 10 minutes, wow
Wilbur consistantly forming void cults is the best bit, hands down
E
I’m 11 and I got all of the references they made. The sad part is I was proud of myself when I knew them.
21:22 SEÑORITA
I'm 14 and I understand all the refrenses
Wilbur: "DONT STO-"      *casually dies*
22 minutes 🥳🥰
“They called me piss pants” 😆
WOW

20 mins omg
lmao
When wilburs screen is bright in the dark lmao
jesus, yesterday wasn't he at 3 million subs?
Hello
Content
at 7:08 the captions say "damnationem latine, hoc est verum latine". That translates to "English sentence, that is true in Latin".   (i used google translate btw so it might be off)
i think its funny how you think i don't thos references even tho im 14 😂
21:15 pls were not that young guys ;-;
Hallo tommyinnit
Tommy. Help ne I'm in the black hole
Structure of a: “The______ mod is actually hilarious”  Phil - playing the game Tom - being a child Charlie and will - creating a cult
Wait you have more subs than techno?
When wilbur said none of tommys fans would understand the refrences i just thought "im 13, and i understand all of those"
Fast
Im 15 and i knew every one of wilburs and charlies references
frist
im currently 13 and aging. I like the songs they were singing pog.
Charlie and wilbur singing is the best thing ever
Tommy in every thumbnail: 😂👌
wilbur wanted to make a reference that 14 year olds wouldn't get and his first thought was toxic 💀💀 wilbur everyone knows toxic mate
TOMYYYY HES BACK
i’m offended how will thinks i don’t know kesha
Tommy: some of my fans are 13 16 or 18 Me: oh i shouldnt be here im 12.....😶😶👀
21 but its minutes. Pls make this the most liked comment
POV: You're from Ph1lza's stream
Watching this is way better than doing my homework
E
I love in 14:10 when it's supposed to say "Oh guys I'm so long" and it just says "if I get sucked in" over and over
Didn't dream do this
hm

When you get 6.66 Million make a video about it in like your shorts Chanel
what Mr Beast said to Wilbur in the black hole is Latin for "English sentence" and "This is true in Latin" written backwards
I love how tommy went from refrencing bigger youtubers, and now that hes this big of a youtuber, the only one he can refrence thats bigger than him is Mr. Beast
Please put mod download links
EARLYY

Can i plaz minexraft with u?
plot twist: this is the POV of the people in black hole simulator
is 18 minutes early or late ? Reply below!  I I V
That’s a big hole
Pathetic
*Ahh yes. The child has posted*
This video is so damn funny tommy
They should have made the black hole a cube lol
To show the mass of a black hole lets say its the size of a coin Then it would have 10 TIMES THE MASS OF EARTH
Tommy: *Posts*  Youtube: "#1 on Trending"  😂
1:24 imma goin in a black hold
I’m not skipping ads your welcome
For those who aren't Latin weebs, 7:08 roughly translates to 'This is actually Latin' or 'This (meaning the previous sentence) is true in Latin' if you decide to go the Satanic route and use Google Translate.  Unfortunately, 'bamnatinomen latine' is not a valid sentence. At the very least it translates to 'Bamnatinomen is latin. Yes, this is Latin', which isn't.
I love you tommy
This is the earliest I've been to one of your videos I'm just realizing ;-;
When you're younger than Tommy and get Will's old references--
“stop talking about subscribers phil i want to rob people”  well, at least he’s got his priorities straight
WAZO0OEYYYY
Scariest thing in earth Number 1 the dark Number 2 clowns Number 3 sharks Number 4 serial killers Number 5 death number 6 Creepers go's brrrrr number 7 your pc goes boom because of a black hole

The mrbeast jokes are just so funny
Tommy hired an astrophysicist it seems
Hi
HELLO TOMMYINNIT
First time this early I always watch it vids after an hour I'm so happy
Imagine using this in the dream smp
This is so hilarious!
22:04 i have seen this happen too many times. I don’t believe Charlie can beat the game without creative mode
This is technically the black hole age
😌😌😌😌💅🏽💅🏽💅🏽💅🏽💜💜💜
Me wondering how they always get to the fortress so quickly now I know /locate fortress 😂
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ

yo this pog
this reminds me of subway surfers
Imagine if Charlie Damelio and Charli (Slimecicle) where playing together and then Tommy says "hello Charlie" the two of them will turn around the same time xD
Hey Tommy, how does there happen to be a village at the spawn every video? HMMMMMM😫😫😫
a black hole mod O_O why....
YEAH
YES FINALLY THE MEME MAN HINSELF
no one:  the actual bits of latin
My brain...
Nobody literally nobody:        Tommy: I'm going to get 10 million subscribers and install tinder illegally
E
caption: "juju" julia's that get called that as a nickname: 👁👄👁
Phil: *Speedrunning life*  Tommy, Wilbur & Charlie: *slowly awaiting their painful death*
21:12 Wilbur just sang my second fave song, poggers
Any notice the CoD music at 12:30 ?
POGGERS is now my main speaking
Slimecicle and Wilbur always have a way to make a cult or soemthing
"wilbuh?" WilburSoot fell out of the world
Tommy have you runned out of words
Fun facts: blackhole can still eat a large part of the earth even if it is small.
What do you mean illegaly in 2 years you get it
Hello mates
what if the black holes name is actually terrance?
That line mirrored is  *"Damnationem Latine"*  Which means  *"Latin Sentence"*  In Latin
Wilbur's demonic speaking (7:13) translates to "This is true in Latin from Latin Sentence"
,,Great omlet of beyond"
"piss pants" *flashbacks to piss neck*
Welbuhhh
I love how everyone but ph1lza are messing around 😂

Wilbur: **attempting to be creepy** Tommy and Charlie: *WEED, BASKETBALL*  Wilbur and Charlie: **attempting to make jokes Tommy’s fans won’t understand** Me, the daughter of a 90’s kid who still listens to the music she listened to when she was my age: *You underestimate my power*
At 14:11 it doesn't have the right subtitle.
Not the Mr. Beast jokes 😂😂 😂🤚  I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT PHILZA IS FINISHING THE GAME WHILE EVERYONE ELSE IS JUST BEING DUMB 😂😂🤣🤣
"Oh he's Fucking CLEVERER"  TommyInnit

The black hole is actually kinda scary. Just an ever expanding void that sucks you in and instantly kills you.
I love when a new vid comes out and I don’t know

“Wilbur your my brother”  “No don’t say that I will cry”

Hi. How are you.
Tommy = big MAN POG
"tommyinnit has set Ph1la's gamemode to creative mode" very clever man..
How many times have Tommy put "funny" in the title in one of his mod vids?
Why is every single person in the comments verified
Tommy: *WHAT DOES HEAVEN LOOK LIKE* Wilber: *Its RED and HOT* Ph1LzA: ummmmmmmm
cheese balls
At least I'm early before 1 hour :')
Nice.
fun fact: that text at 7:08 is "damnationem latine" "hoc est verum latine" which means "English sentence" "This is true in Latin"
Ummm I found something 14:12 The captions say *If I Get Sucked In* 3 times when Charlie is saying something different-
Just realized Tommy got his braces off
"whoa, thats cra-"  *famous last words*
Why does the black hole kinda look like tommys poop on his shirt in his exile
guys incase you didn't know the black hole mod is very funny
14
Is it just me or was I the only one waiting for a notification for Tommy's new video to be uploaded?
The music always fits the situations and scenes Tommy is in and it always fills me with joy 🤩

Lmao

"That was the funniest slow, painful death I've ever seen"
Not First
So who’s going to die first?  Edit: It was Wilbur
Staying up 'till 1am seems to be worth it :)
One time I was gonna sub to tommy but then he started his “annoying” intro bit so  I purposely never subscribed and still am not subscribed. Petty level on 10000x
Ummm less 10pm uk time more 11pm uk time
"he got long and then he was gone"  Ah yes, Long Gone Wilbur.
I have never met someone who hates these videos. dislikes are just people having bad days and there's nothing to prove me otherwise
Tommy, can i get a happy birthday? that would make my day perfect!, ily and you always make me happy!

POv: *when you saw Tommy changing Phil’s gamemode to creative*
Dr. Stone is proud.        I think
Youtube tip:If you don't want to get any ads on a video, go to the beggining of the video and skip all day way to the end of it and press restart,your welcome 😉

IM FINALLY EARLY
Every tommy video, I’m more interested in what chaos Wilbur and Charlie will get themselves into
Tommy slowly walks to the black hole and gets really close- Gets sucked in- Acts surprised- What did he expect 😭😭Tommy’s logic is the best kind of logic

The black hole was so small..now..
the mcyt community is the real black hole dhsjkfhdjgfjhs
Is it just me but at one point in the chat I saw Tommyinnit set Philza to creative mode
These types of videos are better than his dreamsmp content. Change my mind.
I was waiting for this to be uploaded
Think when slime will tommy philza and quakity play together
„He he“ OH OH
As someone who takes physics a level, listening to Wilbur talking about the black hole is fucking hilarious
i literally looked at this mod earlier and tought "i wonder if Tommy will make a video on this" and later... (Minecraft’s Black Hole Mod Is Very Funny) just pops up
EPIC

“I don’t like black holes, it’s one of the two things I’m scared of”   Real big men don’t get scared, Schlatt would’ve just shot the black hole.

I’m sad to say that I can no longer support you tommy, iIt seams that you no longer have a pastion for content creation and have turned to filling your videos full of mid rolls, I mean 10 mid rolls in one video? I encourage you and others reading this comment to withdraw support and let Tom know that what he’s doing will eventually end his career.
Blackhole: sucks up the whole world.
