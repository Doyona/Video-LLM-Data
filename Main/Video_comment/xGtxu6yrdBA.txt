the movie is trash
If ragnarok is scream, love and thunder is scary movie
Just came here to say this is the worst movie i ever watched second only too Assassin creed.
Chris it’s OK to say that this movie sucked
Shit review.
Movie is 🗑 always felt this dude was kind of a shill but bey we like what we lime I guess
I think everyone's missed the point.  This was NOT a Thor movie.   This was "fans"  sharing a Thor adventure story to children. A RETELLING.  Of course it was overly ridiculous. Most retelling of these stories are highly exaggerated.
You are no longer a credible critic of films.
So, you don't usually review movies you don't like?  I guess you didn't like Eternals, I notice that seems to be the only MCU movie you didn't do a review for, which I can understand, I just recently discovered after watching Eternals a 2nd time it didn't work for me.  But, I'll talk about this, I obviously hated Thor: Love and Thunder more than you did, I was really disappointed in seeing this after Ragnorak is one of my favorite MCU movies as well!
Part of the reason for which one would tune into film-criticism, is to learn whether the critic had a positive opinion or a negative one, and why. If your declaration is that you review only that cinema which you can so positively, then there is henceforth no reason to observe any of your critiques: one may simply conclude your conclusion by default: "One thumb up."  Good-bye.
Even Chris Hemsworth hates this movie.
1:19-Question: How does one *build* a tree?
2:36 & 2 years later he still does this whenever he makes a video on a movie that’s bad
Easily the lowest point of the entire MCU....until The Marvels came out that is
The movie was bad
The two Chris's will forever be my Thor and Cap. They could not have cast them better.Honestly, all the casting throughout the entire MCU has been spot on with very few exceptions.. Like Natalie Portman... Sorry, I love her but I really don't like her in these movies!
why are you supporting this woke garbage
Only scenes I like are ewroks look alike enemies and the Zeus. Other scenes are garbage.
The Marvel formula is getting thin. Thor is an example of just running out of ideas for a character, so lets just reach to what feels new regardless of how it fits in the narrative.  The Thor line of films is so disjointed compared to the other lines, not to mention just becoming more goofy with what cud be a serious character as far as source material.  Anyone who thinks Ragnarok was good is saying alot about themselves in general. I respect opinions but that was a hot mess. C'mon!
A real contender for the dumbest movie ever made, this was the last straw that made me happy to quit Marvel forever.
The villain was the only good thing about this movie, IMHO.
Just watched it.  Wow. It was awful
every single scene with the kids was boring and didnt progress anything. just kids sitting in front of the LED wall listening to hemsworth or bale ramble...
Too much comical aspects  for this film, they just did not balance out it correctly, “Guardian” films do it much better
I just learned that this is the one movie where you get to see Chris Hemsworth’s whole family. Each of them act in clips of the movie, including his kids.
This movie was crap i couldnt finish watching
Ha Chris Why was you so mean to the GT Show it's amazing and lots of YouTube well agree with me and call it good or ok but you It feel like you Didn't every watch the movie I I'm trying to to say is your review could have been better and you let me down 😔👎 it feel like you was just trying to get money 💰🤑
The movie is awful it sucks
I held off watching this after hearing it was a big flop when it came out. After just getting through the MCU for the 3rd time I decided what the hell, sigh, it was awful. I hated almost everything about it.
When somebody criticizes a movie and people respond with "Well you couldn't make anything better", they're completely missing the point that the critic is comparing the movie's quality to other movies, not his own. You're allowed to criticize something even if you're not good at it yourself
Well, someone can not say bad things about your upcoming movie...touche salesman
it was a major rollercoaster of a film that didn't  seem to know its own tone. I didn't feel like the serious theme mixed well with the comedic moments. Marvel has an identity crisis. Are they making comedies,, action, or drama. They can make a movie incorporating all three, but they shouldn't lean on only one of those features. The whole thing couldn't be taken seriously, (and that's okay) but then you have almost Shakespearean scenes with Christian bale, and it all feels off.
Did he even rate the film? Can someone leave me a timestamp of when?
Goofy ahh movie.
The script sucked. Let’s all be honest here.
It's true Chris stuckman is now the most positive movie critic on YouTube
It was a pretty poor movie to be honest, until this came up in my feed, I would have forgotten about it...
This feminist woke bs is just ruining everything it touches 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Disney is destroying marvel, making Thor into a joke, a must see for feminists with the strong women characters and trying to make guys seem weak
I’ve stopped watching marvel movies after endgame I didn’t see captain marvel and just the reviews on the movies after were bad I saw multiverse dr strange and hated it there trying to add Mexicans and girls for some reason
This movie was garbagge. Its not the thor we knew in infinity war
Seems you're not being honest here. You hated it but want to be diplomatic.
This movie is lacking in so many ways.  It was crap.  What are the moronic writers and directors thinking???
Why aren't you rating the film? GIVE IT A RATING!  it's a 4.5/10 at best, for Bateman's performance and some Almighty Thor story bits and cool scenes here and there, but the overall film felt like a kids show. I was bored to death watching this trash
1:20 you BUILD one tree? ...where? HOW? ... What kind of tree.. Or do you build One...Three? 1,2,3 ?  I need answers
This movie is absolutely awful. Worst movie of 2022 and of the decade
Thor Rangnarok was like Batman Forver which was decent but not great. I liked that one. This new one is like Batman & Robin which is campy and destroys Thor's character. I felt like I was watching a cartoon.
I'm gonna say it because you can't, this movie is such a mess and one of the worst MCU movies
One of The dumbest movie of the year.
Worst marvel film I’ve seen so far. All marvel after end game has been so meh
They should have hired more people for visual effects
Movie was pretty bad
Finally saw this one...after checking out literally everything else on disney+ first. ^^° The opening scene is very representative for the rest of the movie: Bale as Gorr, crying and and giving a desperate performance Random god: LoL! Look at this sucker.
I finally decided to watch it, and it was even worse than I imagined. Jokes are forced, plot is boring, there's barely any direction, and the most entertainment I had were the goats cause their scream is hilarious but for that I can always watch Goat Remix of Trouble on YT. What hurts me the most is what they did to Thor which had great character arc in Infinity War. At the end of Endgame we see him as this stronger, more mature and confident guy. Here they dumbed him down to the point he's turned into mentally challenged man-child most of the movie for shit and giggles. I'm sure Chris knows that but the fact that he won't even acknowledge it makes me wonder if he should continue doing reviews. I don't follow this channel to watch him ass kissing his "fellow directors", but for genuine opinions of someone who has the balls to share it.
god awful.  more a Monty Python movie.
Biggest load of crap going with such a gay theme. It’s a kids movie ffs, forget the Marvel side of things but it’s so ‘camp’ and full of batty men ffs
It sucked 😕
Shit review… literally danced around the real topics of the film.
agreed, Ragnarok was the best Thor and Marvel movie  this one was too much disrespecting Thor
Remember in The original Avengers flick when Captain America made a ton of friends in the Wikken world when he said "There's only one God"?  Does anybody wonder what he would have thought if he'd got to live to see this planet where all the gods are partying?  Probably would have blown his 101 year old mind.  Thor seemingly was the only god he encountered in the MCU (well, unless you count Loki also).  Maybe there were some other Asgardians at the End Game battle like Valkyrie but Cap probably didn't have time to meet and greet them.
This film is atrocious. Offensively bad treatment of the cancer subject.  And it's not even a film, it's a collection of bad sketches where every charater talks the same way and has no distinct personality.  Ragnarok was...fine, but this...? I don't see how Taika is at all good.
Watch ANY other movie of the MCU before this one. Really. Its probably one if not THE worst movie so far.
Hello Chris. Hoping you could review AURORA 663? Thank you.
I dont kno w what the hell you epoeple are on about! this was a great movie!!I just watched it!~ it was great! granted im drunk as fffffffffffffff but yea I think its good, no idea if idsdgh feel tyhe same way sober but.. bamybe it was written for  youknwou people of lowered intelligencem, like drunk ppl or kids?!?Q!?!@ I loved it!! it was GREAtrgfyhf! lovwe and thunder!!1
This movie destroyed Thor, and ffs kill those stupid goat.
It is a really bad excuse of a movie.
This movie was 90% trash. It's one of the most disappointing Marvel movies I've seen. The humor is absolute vomit material.
Wahtiti went full retard with the humour in this movie!
Thor just feels so uninteresting right now. I really hate how they just give Thor powers to everyone now. Saved just to be ruined again.
Is it me or that Disney movie feel is starting to permeate into the MCU?, with this one in particular i felt out of place watching it, like falling asleep to your usual late night show and waking up in the morning to cartoons, just wth are they doing?
movie is garbage. Marketing message should have been "Not every director has a plan"
I thought the movie was the worst Thor movie made. I feel they have totally destroyed Thor as a character by making him a buffoon for some really horrible comedy. I appreciate that things cannot and should not always be serious in a movie. Lightning the mood with some funny scenes is necessary in a movie. I admit I did make it through the whole movie. Maybe somewhere further in there was SOMETHING that mad Thor seem like less of an idiot and I just didn't get there. For me they are destroying one of my favourite characters. I will try at some point to watch the movie again. I certainly don't expect my opinion will change.
There needs to be a second version released for straight  people. And bring back the macho ass kicking that makes Thor, Thor.
Blah blah blah why don't you be honest? The mpvie is shit. So disappointed with you Chris.
just say you didn't like all the polite tap dancing was exhausting
this is not a review
Trying hard to be "Loki" funny
A little funny at the beginning... but became some BS.
Jesus loves you ❤️ ❤️
I....don't wanna see another Thor from Waititi. However I would like to see a road trip special with Valkyrie, Korg and Miek.
I respect your respect for other filmmakers, Chris. But that should never stop you from making an informed and valid criticism.
So much talking but didnt point out why he said the film is strange.  Lots of bs talking.  THE FILM IS GARBAGE, END OF STORY
It was really bad ...........
i missed your grading Chris and sadly you don't do those anymore why bro i would like to know how would you grade this movie if you give Thor 3 Ragnarok 2017 a B
I really did enjoy this movie and Thor played by Chris Hemsworth he did a great job like he always does in these movies and he was awesome too and Jane Foster aka The Mighty Thor played by Natalie Portman she did a great job in this movie and she is so sexy as hell and she is so gorgeous too and it was so good to see her come back in this franchise too and Gorr the god Butcher played by Christian Bale he did a great job as the main villain in this movie and he was awesome too and I wish he was more on screen though since he barely in this movie and Valkyrie played by Tessa Thompson she did a great job too and she was badass too In this movie like she did in the previous movie and she is so beautiful and really attractive too and Idris Elba he did a great job too but he barely in it though and waste in this movie and why is the Guardian of the Galaxy were in this movie it feels I was watching two separate movies and I’m just not a fan of those movies and why are they in Thor movies I didn’t mind Hulk in the previous movie since I am a fan of Hulk I just don’t care for Guardians of the Galaxy people but just me though and Jaimie Alexander was good too in this movie but barley in it though and overall I’m gonna give Thor 4 Love and Thunder 2022 a 9/10 stars I did enjoy this movie for what it was but could of been little bit better though and I didn’t not like the post credits scenes it feels like they are setting up a another one and it just needs to die man but I will watch a another one and that’s it one more and it better be the end of Thor too since he already have 4 movies now but that just me though in my opinions on this movie Chris Stuckmann bro
This was one of the worst movies I ever seen from Marvel.... the corny jokes and this movie was like for a kid that was five and under.
Thor Love and Thunder is more enjoyable than Dr strange in the multiverse of Madness.  I loved thor in Short hair.
They destroyed all of his character growth and made him a joke and a buffoon. The humour was skewed way too silly and they gave the director, the keys and he drove off a cliff.
Let me help you make up your mind: You HATE Love and Thunder
Watiti did a better job of butchering the character of Thor than the villain did.
I watched it on Disney Plus THIS MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE ARE YOU SERIOUS
Anyone feels that "Why is Batman Who Laugh in a Marvel movie?" when watching this movie? I love Thor.. But Batman Who Laugh is the star of this movie for me.
This movie was trash…..they trying too hard to make Thor look like a buffoon. The character is based off of manly Vikings and he was anything but that. Nothing masculine about this version of Thor in this movie. Character assassination!!!!
Let's be honest!!!...you have to be high or drunk as an adult to like this movie.
This movie went totally” the woke way”, totally garbage, the best things were the goats and the anti hero
It needed Loki 😢
I recently found your channel and really enjoy your content! Just subscribed! :)
Aside from the comedic bits, the writing sucks, but everything else is fun to look at and listen to. Good music and interesting effects. I found the movie really aesthetically pleasing, with a confusing storyline and good comedy bits.
I’m not sure why they thought fans would get a kick out of seeing a bunch of kids turned into superheroes as the final scene of the movie. It was stupid, ridiculous and insulting. I’m glad I didn’t pay to see this in the theater and will not be giving any more money to Disney if this is what we have to look forward to.
Thor love an thunder, turned Thor into a comical two dimensional character, a shadow of the Thor we saw in the first movie. And they copied the concept in Doctor strange or even though strange had powerful magic he couldn't heal his hands but for some reason he has guardians who were a thousand years more advanced than humans had no way to cure Jane's cancer dumb concept made no sense. I hated what they did to Thor they really need a reboot this ridiculous childish immature cartoon Thor. And there's so many things wrong with the story itself they should have stopped with the third Thor movie.
Wasn't the best movie ever rubbish really.
Wheres the review? You spent 10 minutes talking about the marketing for the film and the trailers... How about talking about the movie itself
James gunn would be awesome doing thor. He could get rid of the childish tone waititi has brought in but also keep the humour.
I was definitely hoping we would have seen baldr the brave in this movie and I had a theory that he would have to find hela and defeat her to get the Odin force so he is powerful enough to battle gorr instead they made gorr look weak
I didn't recognized Batman as Gorr, but it's ok. I didn't like how they portrayed Zeus and Hercules looks weak - they should've got some bodybuilder. Also, this film is incredibly racist toward Viking culture because Valkyrie is black and also many children too. Black valkyrie is also king, which also stupid, no woman can be a king, only a queen.
I used to find this guy to be a very credible critic and reviewer but something changed since the day he made the last Jedi review, it's like he lost something it's like he stopped being true to us and himself, you've lost your self dude.
I feel like this was a review of press conferences and marketing than the film.
Didn't  care for this one to much
Chris,we’re close to each other! Please give me a job in a film! I have credits,and know everything about film! Thank you! Chris
The movie sucked. I didn’t like it
i feel like the children plot shouldn't have existed
Best wishes for the success of your movie.
I like this movie a lot, because it wasn't any forced serious plot or plan. It dropped many jewels in the sense, that the next generation of heroes can be formed. It was a light-hearted movie to me...I can see multiple movies being pulled out of this.
Tbh, it was poor. To many gags. All the men are goofy. Made to look like fumbling fools. All the women are stoic, brave and wise and Thor doesn’t even have a hammer. He has an axe. It just feels like a set up to weaken the worlds view of men and watch women take alleged power. It’s just a movie you say? Watch for yourself. Woke bs
I thought it was great
Thank you for having a more rational approach to critiquing this film, I have a similar perspective; not great but enjoyable.  I get the feeling that there was a lot that was shot and a fair amount was left on the cutting room floor; more Gorr would be great.
Half of your video is useless babbel
this movie is actually really good! I enjoyed it very much! 👍
Just saw this POC and I, I just can't 🥱
Not gonna be critical of others work now. Weak. Been real but I'm out. Good luck with your movie
What went wrong with Love and Thunder? Rita Ora. Everything was all good with Waititi until he got involved with her. That's who I'm blaming anyway. She's like a living breathing curse and thank your lucky stars that he didn't cast her in the movie!
I Just love how you talk about movies genuinely. I have learned a lot from you. Thanks man for making these beautiful vids. ❤️❤️❤️
I just watched this movie and I cried.  On of the worst movies I have seen.
I love the Marvel movies, but I thought this movie was garbage. Half way through I was actually annoyed at how cheesy it was. Idk Marvel has been taking a turn for the worse lately and it’s honestly so sad.
this flim is the biggest humiliation for Christian bale...
The best word I can use to describe this movie is rushed. Everything in this movie feels rushed and unfinished. This movie is 1hr and 57 to 59 minutes long. That is incredibly short. Especially for an mcu movie. Hopefully they make another one but actually be patient with it and make it with some ‘focus’ because I like Tika and his vision for Thor and I like hemsworth as this character.
I just got done watching this movie. Is Disney purposely trying to wreak the marvel stories? This movie looks like a child's movie-like chitty chitty bang bang meets Jack in the beanstalk. The pathos are so heavy handed that I thought for sure that someone was going to lose their pet dog. The comedy dialogue ia cute to the point of silly stupid. I agree with the idea but how many times do we need to hear--Women can be hero--children can be heros too. This movie might have been good but chose to be Disney instead.
Boy do I wish paramount still had control of marvel. Disney marvel sucks.
2:54 is where you lost me.... Jeremy Jahns keeps it 100%
Hands down the worst Thor movie yet how it got 64 percent  idk. But should have gotten 15 percent it was trash 👎
Honestly? They need to kick Taika Watiti out of Thor movies and bring Kenneth Branaugh back if they can. Or someone who could take the myth more seriously and stop treating it like a cartoon. Taika however could still direct future Guardians of the Galaxy movies. He seems more suited to that really. The goofy humour.
Honestly? I'm just glad Sif's still alive and the movie had the balls to kill Jane off. Gorr was great but I wish his threat was taken more seriously. And Zeus? Well he's entertaining yes and him being a dick is close to Greek Myth but he's much better in the deleted scenes and that says it all really. As for Thor, yeah he was way too dumb and goofy and Waitit so he needs a more serious direction again. You could write this all off as this being his mid life crisis. He is hundreds of years old after all.
Taika's been toking too much lately it seems. LOL.
I disagree the comedy in this movie did not work at all for me, all the forced poses. There is one pose from Valkyrie when she opens her arms wide and the camera show her from above, it made me remember the fight when Master Windu does something like that, opening his arms wide in the middle of the fight as if it was a dance or something and it looked so fake. Perhaps I see stuff other people don't? I don't know. 😞
I felt there was too much comedy put in this movie and not enough build up to how she became thor and got cancer etc and Gorr
Terrible
I couldn’t get past 30 minutes. Total garbage and not exiting or funny
Review start 2:10
I just tried to watch this film. . . .and after Christian Bales first scene. . . I just couldn't stomach it after about 15 minutes.
1.11.49 in and I turned the garbage off. Thor is  now the mosr cringe, woke BS ive seen.
“Now that I make movies that will likely suck “ lol way to hedge your bets my guy
Thanks
This is the worst marvel movie yet, it's so absurdly juvenile.  I loved all the thor movies but honestly this is a joke!!
Taika Waititi was busy tonguing Tess Thompson with his wife.
Is it obvious Chris has sold out yet?
Movie was garbage. Bale was the only good part. And to say underutilized is being nice. He was wasted. Bale probably only took the part because on paper Gorr had a lot of depth but to his dismay all of his character depth was left on the cutting room floor.
I've so far been made very bitter by much of the phase four MCU movies. So many trash films that either insult the characters, or insult the audience, but I was pleasently surprised by how entertaining this movie was. The film has a lot of issues, like how the visual effects in some scenes are weak, or how there's a contradiction in tone between thriller dark or family friendly. But I was very happy not to be given politics in a movie where it's just supposed to be about superheroes. I love how the villan was given so much respect. By far one of the best villians in trhe entire MCU.
Some of the special effects seemed rushed and not polished; which is a surprise for a Marvel movie..
i'm glad that taika brought a less serious and more light hearted kids movie feel to this movie.
This is one of the most awful movie I have ever seen the way they ridiculed Zeus who's argue as powerful as Odin, the way a mere Valkyrie could use Zeus lightning the fact that Thor could kill Zeus who's immortal lol bro Zeus will smoke Thor any day anytime he's Odin's mate not Thor's
Too many damn jokes. I checked out of the movie when Thor was talking to the kids and the annoying asshole was tickling him with a feather. Hardly a single serious moment in the entire movie.
People, I think you will appreciate this movie more after you realize that it is a parody of Marvel movies  - SPOILERS AHEAD -   If you put on the Parody glasses, it is brilliantly funny! They are undercutting any and all over-serious moment. For example with outrageous costumes, such as the doctor-cancer scene by the vending machine. They litterarly made the film black and white during the serious boss fight, where Valkyria gets cut down with a death sword, but she has plot armor so shrugs it of and "looses a kidney". Add to that the constant stream of jokes and this becomes the Space Balls / Blazing Saddles of Marvel movies.  This was my favourite marvel movie in a long time: it doesn't take itself too seriously and wears it's fabolous colours on its sleeves!
The film is so disappointing!
I rewatched this movie and it's a very good movie and the story is pretty good
The marketing should read, not every director has a plan. Lol
The movie was decent but it did nothing to move the franchise forward
I have mix feeling on beginning of the movie. But when my nephew asked "what is orgy?" Im totally speechless 😑
Consider every element that's needed to make a solid movie .... now shoot them with a blunderbuss filled with cow shit and this is what your left with.
60 seconds; like an eternity. click click click
a masterpiece of satanic ocultism
I can't believe the folks at Marvel produced such disgusting stuff. I never thought such a thing was possible and this shit has gotten great reviews on top of that. It really shows that something very bad is happening in the world and it's scary.
With the highly overdone Italian accent Zeus sported I almost expected him to hurl a pizza in place of a lightning bolt.  Thor is my favorite Marvel hero BUT just too much silliness in this one for me. Don't think I will ever want to revisit it.🎃
While the movie is far from being an actual good one because of too much comedy and most of it being just not as good as in the past there are several elements that make it at least good enough to watch even if it is a downgrade from ragnarok. Gorr’s look in my opinion is perfectly done which is something I dreaded because I didn’t want him to look like Voldemort like in the comics there has to be some difference and his goal of reaching eternity and slaying the gods like that though it doesn’t sound as fun as making the god bomb still sounds like it can be a major threat because if he reaches eternity that’s it he wins while with the god bomb there are still ways he can fail ( haven’t actually read a lot of the comics but I just wanna say eternity full-proof planet if he reaches it). He should have been a lot darker though and should have had at least 5 minutes of god-slaughtering terror and massacre on screen to make us fear him. What we got is a sad father who makes corny jokes to the kidnapped kids when he should have straight up crushed their hope with his darkness. Thor was kind of ok just his comedy is downgrading, and his arc is maybe a bit confusing as it starts with him having his heart closed then opens the plot of the corrupt gods and ends again with him opening his heart by choosing to love well…  Love. On the one hand that would indicate having the deleted scene with Zeus as a father figure and mentor complete the arc and be meaningful but on the other hand having the gods be corrupt aligns with the plot set up in eternals where they are shown to like ego only care for their own species and sacrifice entire civilisations to create more of themselves (and two were in omnipotence city so in my eyes they are gods or at least godly beings) and creates a good enough phase 5 plot to resolve while slowly preparing for the imminent arrival of kang and dr doom to bring the real terror. What should have been done at least in my eyes is for the corrupt gods arc to take place as it had then Zeus finds out they faced gorr and survived have a change of heart and have the deleted scene take place. That way thor’s arc is complete and the gods corruption will still be front center but will begin to end sooner. After credits scene would have been instead of Zeus sending Hercules to kill Thor, Zeus explaining how they have lost their way and to begin to make amends send Hercules to become a hero on earth like thor (and while I can’t wait for Thor and Hercules to collide in the future the two of them set to collide as enemies isn’t nearly as cool to anticipate as a mirror of iron man vs thor in which case they would collide for a misunderstanding but soon enough become allies )
A stupid polynesian made this film.
Just watched this with my daughter and Jesus what a disaster.  I'm not a bot who's going to wax on about the Jane Foster aspect of the story.  I need to know how a studio who does so many things right with Iron Man, Captain America and even Dr Strange can get almost everything wrong about Thor.  He's been reduced since Guardians of the Galaxy were introduced to comedy relief.  Gor was woefully under developed.  He didn't seem dangerous and wasn't fleshed out enough to make anyone care.  You cant build a God tier villain by throwing a Diablo 2 type cutscene in at the beginning and ignoring him for the next half hour 40 minutes because we all know Gor is just filler for Jane Foster and woman power.  I am all for female characters in Marvel but make them strong and dignified on their own instead of faking it by making every male character a dolt.  It's become Hollywood formula that no woman can't appear strong and smart unless the men are weak and comically dumb.  I grew up a huge Avengers fan.  Thor is more than this garbage misrepresentation.
who made this? National Lampoon? This is worse than the pissie Hulk we now have.
Ragnarok is one of my favorite Marvel movies.  Love and Thunder seemed to try to repeat most of the Ragnarok tropes, but everything seemed . . . off.  Clumsy.  Over-the-top, but not in an effective way.  Most of the jokes were just off enough that they didn't land for me.  I felt like each scene was rushed in order to get to the next one, with weak connections between them.  There is so little explanation for Jane becoming Thor - just one flashback, a quick shot the hammer self-assembling, and BOOM, she is a fully-formed Thor kicking ass and that's that.  Are you kidding me?  I want to see that transformation!  Can we at least get a montage?  Jane and Thor seem to have very little chemistry.  Natalie Portman is a great actress but her attempts at humor just don't land for me (I think the writing was just off).  Ragnarok is great because Thor shows some vulnerability and humor, while still retaining some dignity and godlike presence.  In Love and Thunder, this is pushed to the point where he is an absolute bumbling moron.  There is nothing he doesn't screw up.  It's just . . . off.  The Zeus scene was a jumbled, frenetic mess.  I found Russel Crowe extremely annoying and his accent just seemed like something you'd find in a middle-school play.  Over the top and clumsy.  I feel like someone (maybe not Taika) went "just take what you did in Ragnarok and dial it up another notch", resulting an a chaotic, forced, disjointed mess.  Hey, we have a classic rock soundtrack - check.  Slow motion jumping shots - check.  Completely useless Guardians of the Galaxy cameo (where none of them seemed excited to be in the movie" - check.  I thought Christain Bale's opening scene was great, though.  Until he ran into the God who was clumsily, one-dimensionally bad for the sake of being bad so Gorr would be justified killing him.  Can't he have a tiny bit of nuance?  Can't Gorr feel some conflict in killing his god?  This movie just does not work, and I couldn't make it all the way through.  Perhaps this is evidence of just how much of an achievement Ragnarok was, where despite lots of silliness everything was perfectly calibrated.  It just WORKED.  Maybe it's just one of those things that can only be pulled off once.    All I know is that whatever magic made Ragnarok work was completely absent in Love and Thunder.
this is where i want to separate CGI perfection from plot story.
Wasn’t good but wasn’t as bad as I expected better than multiverse of madness but still overall not very good. Bale made the movie interesting with out him there i prob wouldn’t have finished it.
i laughed , i cried , i kissed 6 bucks goodbye . a very sad ending to a once good franchise, seriously did they make it up as they went no story no action .complete waste of my time ie; garbage Disnyt better wake up , more and more flops ,enough with the woke crap   definitely need over watch on their productions  , this movie sinks along with the Disney cruise
This movie was so bad
For me it was a cringe fest  Starts with jokes after jokes  And ends with a montage of kids shooting lightning and all of a suddeb thor is a single father now wtf  The only good part was thor with jane
Geez dude talk about yourself a little more
All the reasons for why Chris Stuckman is such a a great review are right here, clear and concise about how he felt about the film but also respectful to the filmmaker (if they deserve it) and everyone involved.  Hope the development of your film is going great Chris!
If you go into this movie expecting any sort of serious tone, that's on you. It's a good movie.
Wayyyy too much comedy
Sorry chris... this was an absolute trash movie, pure garbage trash my guy and the fact your defending some of this is a bit worrying
I'm going to be real with you Chris I personally think forth installments should never be made.  Especially when the mainline trilogy is pretty solid. It wasn't the worst fourth in someone I've ever seen but it felt out of place and non essential to Thor as a character.Yes I know the dark world isn't Loved by everybody but it still played a key role in the infinity saga. This movie feels just kind of like an afterthought. Like they thought "oh crap we still have Thor what should we do with him?" which kind of bums me out because where he was left hin endgame was pretty open-ended and I'd like that more than I like this movie. Leaving it open-ended to where we could assume he got back to the old self is better than just making him a joke.
Thor peaked at Ragnararok. Love and thunder was okay.
I love marvel but this movie was ASS😂😭💯
Taika Waititi is funny. But I think that he thinks he's really really funny.
I thought this was actually one of the VERY FEW Marvel movies I enjoyed. I don't know nor care about any of that superhero crap. But it was a good comedy.
I enjoyed Thor 1 more than this.
There was so much cliche marvel superhero lines, the scenes were all over the place. You would get lost in the dialogue. So many scenes that didn't stay on the mood of the scene, it felt real sped up on Thor and Jane, Gorr was not utilized to his fullest,(not Christian bales fault) he was great but the scenes didn't compliment him. The Director is Trash no way around it. So superficial
Not good movie. For 10+ years old comedy. My score 4/10 .
This movie is a steaming pile of cinematic crap. It's silly and stupid even for a Marvel comic book hero right down to the screaming goats. I can't believe any of the actors in this film agreed to be in it. It's an excuse to push woke crap and a series of really bad one-liner jokes. Awful!! Don't waste your money or your time.
I fell asleep through it twice
It's an absolute pile of crap
Here’s a tip to everybody that just loves to type and type and type and type.  And you love posting comments that are 3 inches / 4 to 5 / 5 to 6 inches and longer.  There is this thing called paragraphs. Learn them. Use them!
This movie was so stupid!!!  So idiotic!!  not only are we glad that we didn’t spend money at the theaters to go see this piece of comical garbage that panders to the left we didn’t know if we was watching a cartoon or a movie for a good 30 minutes!!     We watched just about half of it on HBO Max and that was enough for us. What a shit for brains movie.  Chris Hemsworth should’ve never allowed himself to sign on to such a PIECE OF DINGLE BERRY SCRIPT.   (We,  meaning me and my wife. )
What a bad movie this was.  I can't believe what passes for Quality in the minds of the majority. Absolutely pathetic
I like Chris' reviews are very respectful towards the team behind a film which probably has to do with him being behind that process as well, which I'm not saying he didn't do it before that, but I do feel some evolution on his views
I dont know how Russell Crowe agreed for that role
I have mixed feelings about this movie the story could have been very good if they stuck to some of the elements of the comics when it came to the sword the “villain” had lol the fact that I can’t even remember his name or that of the sword even tho I love that story ark in the comics speaks to how disappointed I was the whole movie was all about jokes like way to much joking around idk why everyone thinks we want a Deadpoolish hero every single time it only worked with him because that’s his thing he’s known for that other then that all I’m asking for is a tad bit more seriousness in these hero movies and series like just look at the old hulk movies almost little to no jokes
I think Chris' proximity to the movie industry is going to distort or outright alter his ability or willingness to give open and honest reviews about bad movies.  There was so much hedging and preemptive backpedaling before offering up his opinion that it just felt disingenuous, probably because it was.  I'll say what the review should've said: this was a terrible movie and it doesn't deserve your time or your money.
Terrible, just terrible.  The jokes fell flat all the time. It's like the pitch were like "people loved the wacky tone of Ragnarok... MOOOORE. JUST SHOVE IT IN!!"  3 Guns n Roses songs!? One of them played twice?? I love Korg in the other movies, but he really over stayed his welcome here. Too much of a good thing! And oh my god... the wokeness... I'm so done with Marvel
not everything is supposed to be funny im 20 minutes into the movie and im about to turn it off, disney is ruining marvel
Bloody awful movie
This movie was shockingly awful. Most know this.
There were some funny moments in the first third, but the rest of the movie was very boring imo.
Nataly Portman is super overrated
Ever since Disney took over marvel . All this movies have become very goofy , stupid silly and very kiddie material . Same with Star Wars . So disappointed 👎
That was easily the worst MCU movie to date.
Just watched this. Such a mess of a film.
Love and Thunder was cheesy, cringy and too comedic for a story about a guy who’s going around killing Gods. There’s some good humor but they took the humor way WAY overboard.
Fun movie
Your video is 9 min long with a 3min intro about your sponsors...
Thor love and blunder!!!!!!!
It was always going to be hard to follow up Ragnarok but agree with others that the comedy undermined  some of the serious moments. Odins death and loss of Mojilnir in that movie allowed the comedy to be a way to deal with grief. Whereas the self identity crisis didn't hit as hard. In endgame/infinity war they did so much more for Thors internal struggle and he had a whole movie here to create depth.   And although they gave Natalie Portman more to work with, her character could have used more development--didn't feel the chemistry between her character and Thor. Just a little hollow...they should have teased the feelings more on the boat and had her show Thor the cancer as a surprise after the battle scene. Instead they fall back in love too easily.  A wasted effort from Batman.   Even with that, it was better than expected given all the mixed reviews. The cameos were not too distracting and if the story was tighten up, could have been a phase 4 masterpiece.
Just saw the movie today. Was looking forward to it but after seeing it. It was more suited to 15yr old kids and under. Was soo disappointed.
I’d been hearing people talk shit about this movie for months before I finally watched it on Disney+ last week and uh…I didn’t find it bad at all? Like I genuinely enjoyed it?   No one is talking about the power balance between Jane and Thor. There was no cringy girlbossery that played out in Jane becoming a Thor as in she didn’t act like his rival or as if she was better than him, they didn’t make Thor seem clumsy or incompetent. They truly felt like a team along with Valkyrie. Natalie did so much better in this film than the first two films. They got to be in love again and express their vulnerabilities. This is something feminists express wanting to see so badly in these types of films because the girlboss shit is so cringe and done so poorly, yet no one is talking about how beautifully this movie portrayed equality between Thor and Jane. I was so impressed.
My issues all revolve around character development.  1. Thor has grown so much in every movie. This feels like several steps backwards. 2. I wish we had more character focus on Mighty Thor and Gor. They should have been the focus and show how they're opposite sides of the same coin. 3. The Mjolnir talking jokes. Thor has never treated the hammer like that, and he's willfully let Cap use it in Endgame. It was just weird.  My wife and I just felt the movie didn't fit like it should and felt off. Marvel in general needs to dial back the jokes. You can have serious moments and just let them sink in.
I’ve always loved stuckmann’s reviews and for a long time have trusted him to guide my movie-watching… but I just didn’t really understand this review - he didn’t seem to actually explain what was good or bad about the movie in the way he always has in the past  (it seemed to be mostly just visuals good, action good, structure bad, followed by comments about things a i as viewer don’t really know about like promo production or interview leashes).   So ultimately, I think this may be the first time evert that he’s said a movie is pretty good without too many caveats, and after watching I’ve come away thinking it was absolutely unwatchably terrible.
Movie felt like it was made for kids no sense of vulnerability or seriousness though drama or deep emotion. It kept losing my interest. I felt almost embarrassed even watching the movie
Awesome shirt
Why this movie was so boring it kept losing my interest.
Nothing sucks more than being away from my phone and not being able to skip the mandatory 3 mins ads that every youtuber has at the beginning of their videos
The comedy in this film was horrible...really took away from it.
This was a parody of Thor. Plan and simple. It was a kids movie with some weird adult themes (party orgies?) it was just off.
I was a bit sickened seeing a stage 4 cancer chemo scene, and they do a Cheerio product placement. Well done for a product that probably gave someone cancer in the first place.
They’re definitely pushing the gay agenda on this movie. Lol smh horrible
Worse Marvel movie to date for me, hot garbage, too childish, forcing jokes constantly which were not funny at all, and of course, had to have some wokism shit...
Film was such a disappointing watch,waisted 2 hours on it 🤣first taikai show I hated
It is much better than Ragnaroc. It is much better than no way home
Yep totally didn’t enjoy not from a place of hate I loved ragnarok but at the end of the movie I just felt nothing
Was it supposed to be a comedy? Where is Milnir that Thor brought back from the past that Cap had?  Did he leave it behind in the past?
I was really hoping this movie was going to be better than the typical toxic reaction to everything these days.  But…it really was god awful.  I couldn’t stop cracking up at the goats just because I couldn’t believe someone thought they were a good idea.  And it was all over the place in a bad way, pacing was horrendous, agenda pushing was over the top, hated Gorr, hated the stupid Greek accent for Zeus (even though he is Greek).  Just bad.
This was one of the worst films and probably the worst opening 15 min to a movie I've ever seen.
I loved this movie. Right up there with ragnarok. Normally I hate when they put a gf into a role. But I really enjoyed seeing Jane as Thor. They added the things she could do with the hammer. People are complaining that it's too funny. It wasn't THAT funny. They were making it sound like every line was a joke. They want a serious Thor movie. Like the dark world? Lol the villain had a story of why he became bad which I always thoroughly enjoy.
I feel very weird that Christian Bale presence in the movie kinda highlight how noob the MCU stars actually are when being put side to side with Bale's performance.
it was a SHIT movie
After seeing Zeus and Hercules, I wanted to see Kratos , and now I think Gorr is similar to kratos
*inserts laugh track for the entire movie*
The movie was good. Not sure what people were expecting. Marvel movies are just fun movies, so I'm satisfied with a simple story with no major plot holes. There weren't any cringy woke moments. As an adult some of the scenes were childish, but then if you put it aside and remember that it is for kids, it's enjoyable. All these people looking for deep character development from a Marvel movie, I just don't get it.
Disney just collecting money at this point.
I just watched this movie and I liked it better than doctor strange: into the multiverse and spider man: no way home. The first 30 minutes is a bit weird but I feel like from then on the movie is quite good. Would have loved to see more of gorr and random comedic seens
So, for Love and Thunder:   At first it was a bit too silly for me. In the first act and halfway through the second act the tone was kinda all over the place, it was sad-ish, silly, serious, and foreboding, but the pace didn't really match. Once we got to Thor attacking Zeus then things started to pick up and harmonize better, it started to feel almost like Ragnarok again. There were a lot of jump cuts that didn't feel natural but on the whole, it wasn't a bad movie and it was better than Thor 2.   So for me:  1. Thor Ragnarok 2. Thor (the original) 3. Love and Thunder 4. The Dark World
I hated this movie. I’m the hugest marvel fan but they are letting TK destroy Thor. No heart. I hate Jane as “ Thor” the daughter and the stupid kids plot. Just god awful. Turning Thor into an Oaf is the biggest sin. It’s all bad. Except Bale but they even screwed THAT up by making him a glorified extra. Just awful.
This movie was horrible! That's the honest truth! Should be called Marvel get your head out of your Azz!
Thor was like a big kid in this movie I kinda hated it even the serious moments he didn’t seem to take it aeriously
I will give the movie 5 over 10
Terrible film.
For me this is the best movie of phase 4 so far. I thought Shang Chi was terrible and No Way Home was a bad movie with lots of fan service. Love And Thunder does nothing that affects the overall plot of the Multiverse saga, so secrecy might be less important for that reason?
Natalie Portman  ,in the movie  , seen when she  is die , that's her   real  face  & neck    , next seen blonde botox ! It's all in the name with  ' TOX  ' AT THE END OF  YOUR MEDIATION  ,  BE WARNED  DRUG COMPANIES  , STAY ALIVE ! BY YOU AND YOUR LOVE ONES ❤️ LIVES ,  MAN KIND IS NOT PERFECT !  YOU  PERMATIVE HUMANS  ARE ALL LONG FOR THE RIDE ,
Not a bad movie.  Just not for me.
So you are not a critic anymore? What's the point of this channel anymore? No wonder I hardly watch your reviews nowadays...
I feel like they were trying too hard to be funny. The jokes in Ragnarok worked well, but I think here, not so much. Bale was great as usual and would have loved to see more of him instead of the supposed to be funny scenes they were trying to show.
I remember when last jedi came out and I thought that was bad. Love and thunder is soooo much worse. Without a doubt, the worst marvel movie of any series.
Can’t believe these people spent a huge amount of money just to create such a farcical movie with good talented cast and crew? You could have spent one third of the cost if you want to produce a parody of a movie with Marvel characters.  And no, you won’t care about the characters given the way it’s done.
Too many characters
It feels like a Thor slice-of-life movie which I enjoy.
love and thunder > ragnarok
I'm really surprised. I went into the movie expecting to hate it, because I heard before that it's bad. ​But I loved it!  To be honest, it's kind of the opposite for me with Ragnarok. In the way that I think it was great and entertaining and I loved it, but everyone else was hyping it a little more than me...or maybe it's just my memory.   Anyhoo, I'm not really sold on Hercules as the next villain, if that's a thing now...
I've just seen the movie. Only good thing about it was Christian Bale. Movie was boring, stupid plot, childish at times, bad perfornamnce by Tessa Thompson, music of Guns and Roses again and again and again... was tiring. The Goats made me laugh, i'll give them that. I rather die on some hot desert alone, than watch this movie again. Goodbye.
They were running on a thin plot, so there was a bit too much odd social filler to demonstrate how modern their views are. Like Valkyrie being gay and called King, Korg being gay. Natalie Portman taking on the masculine role, and refusing to be called lady. Seemed a bit cheap and over the top. The axe was the best love story in the movie.
About how I felt with the movie. Nothing to rave about though an enjoyable fun watch.
I definitely don’t think it’s as bad as people make it out to be. It’s a more one off solo film that I appreciate takes the time to be it’s own thing instead of trying to fit in one big connected universe like every Marvel film now. It definitely has issues such as the wonky CGI in sections, and the characterization of Gorr, but overall I would say it was a “good” film. Not great but a fun film to take your mind off stuff. My biggest issues with the film was just how lack luster some of the characters felt such as Jane who felt like she had a lot of missing scenes and so did Gorr. I was so interesting in Christian Bale finally being apart of the MCU as he is an actor we haven’t seen in this caliber in a Marvel film. To be he was absolutely wasted in this film and could’ve had much more screen time and possibly could’ve been the best MCU villain. Christian Bale is one of those actors that the MCU doesn’t deserve and the fact they cut his performance short is a testament to me believing the producers were worried he was going to steal the spotlight from the main characters. I surly don’t think this film is the worst or even one of the worst Marvel films as there are so many more than fall into that category. This one just felt somewhat underwhelming, but still fun.
After reading all the issues of Thor: God Of Thunder, I would say that MCU literally destroyed the character of Gorr. The runtime of the movie was very less. And Gorr had a great potential in the movie. But, MCU didn't use his potential well in the movie. Gorr is a brutal character and MCU made a fun of him. Gorr the God Butcher was shown like Gorr the Children Kidnapper. We didn't see him brutally butchering a God. Also, Zeus, who is considered equal to Odin, was made a joke in the movie. The movie didn't felt like it was serious. Humor is important for a movie but there was excessive humor. Neckrosword which was able to cut the head of celestials 100 times stronger than Arishem the judge was also shown too weak. The movie should have a bit dark and brutal. It was a pg 13 movie, but you can make a movie brutal under that rating. I would say TLAT was good but Thor Ragnarok was a masterpiece. I love Taika Waiti but his direction style was not suitable for a character like Gorr. Maybe, in a parallel universe, Zack Snyder has directed the movie. And there, the movie is the best MCU movies ever. But Thor Love and Thunder disappointed me a lot. I know many people will disagree with me, but after reading the original source material, you all will agree with me. Moreover, Thor Ragnarok is best Thor movie so far.
Movie had no direction,unserious,cheap story….Was a disappointing experience 💔💔💔….looks like it was rushed 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾
Just watched this movie...and the ending alone made me hate it even worse
bruh how scared are you to express your opinion? you go back n forth on every single statement and can't come to a conclusion bc...you're afraid to hurt ppls feelings...seems like ur on track to make shit movies just like this. much love tho! :)
Finally watched that movie.  It felt very disrespectful.   It seemed like the source material and the audience is being mocked.
Way to much childish humor. Couldn't take it seriously-diologue was awful! Needed a better director and screenplay. Very disappointed
Yes this film was overly childish especially when you compare it to the godbutcher comics but after the second viewing I think  it's grown on me a bit
This film was a joke and not a funny one
Garbage movie,.....turned thor into an emotional femboy always at the brunt of jokes,.....and turned his status as a God into just an identity as they hack up some non existent story of mjolnir creating another thor but female ( gender politics ) Not sure why the entire movie needed to be a comedy, nor why they had to throw in a nod to lesbians as valkrie reveals her sexuality, which had no bearing on the movie and nobody asked or cared,....and a female monarch would be a queen not a king,....sorry wokies, facts do exist. Much like the fact that your agenda is poisoning and ruining everything you touch. Stop promoting women at the expense of men, its imbalance, and looks nothing like equality.
this movie made ragnorak worse
Wow your definitely part of the establishment… you “kid gloved” this review… Thor sucked ass…
Finally got to see it, honestly I thought it was pretty bad 😂
Movies which u say good are boring and slow to me
Disney are making marvel movies for 10 year old non binaries it like looking at Power Rangers… or some romcom.
Very disappointed with this film, to be honest more like a comedy. Please don't do another Thor movie, I think marvel are just rolling out films for the sake of it. I would say that the first avengers film is probably the best film marvel has made and the winter soldier. The rest are average. This Thor movie gets 1 ⭐
WHAT HAPPENED TO MARVEL?
When i saw Bale was on the shoulder of chris,,,I swear to god ..they are like VIKRAM AND BETAL (indian greatest ) omg...just perfectly matched...i wish MARVEL see the Ramanad sagars one...poor marvel they have everything but not that kind story we have But they can  make it by buying the rights,,and i believe it could have been a world wide blockbuster for decade...But again its a matter of EGO
Just watched the movie. I thought to many jokes. There was no time to let them breathe
Love And Thunder was really bad! And I hate Guns N Roses! Bale was great. Only ONE joke got me laughing and that was the screaming goats. Anyone who has been around goats know that goats do scream.
This was good movie, way better then the first, wich first half was great, but second half was crap of first Thor, dark world worst then thus one, ragnorok just as good this one
This MARVEL film will have Stan Lee turning in his grave!  I hope this is not the beginning of the end of the high standards Marvel films used to be known for. This was mildly entertaining but shockingly shallow and felt like it was devised by a 5 year old child!
The costumes and weapons looked like they were from a toy store. Zeus lighting bolt weapons was absolutely lame
This is not only the worst SJW woke marvel movie, but one of the worst films made in years
Worse marvel film to date, really really cheesy
Just watching this film now,its absolutely 💩
I think Disney is just trying to churn this crap out and even the actors and directors involved are starting to get their hands tied. And those involved in this phase are the first to find out after signing up a long time ago when things were good.   But I also agree, way more gore the god butcher. Be with him more, make him a more imposing threat.
2:19/2:35/5:47
I finally just watch TLAT I absolutely loved it um I’m just a fan of the comics and MCU it made me laugh and cry and I’m not overly sensitive and the ending actually made me want more Thor adventures but that’s just me, great review.
It was more like a comedy
This isn't Thor.. Disney: love and trash talk waste time movie.  Except for Christian Bale's amazing performance..
I don’t understand why they would make a movie about Gorr when he just Fort Gorr the god butcher in infinity wars the whole Thanos thing lol and the level of disrespect towards Zeus was Outrageous they had the chance to make a great movie And they FD it up. really need stand lee Marvel should have hung up the tile when Stan Lee died RIP STAND LEE. THIS MOVIE WAS GARBAGE 🗑 CAPITAL TRASH CAN 💯💯💯💯
The movie was garbage, just say it.   Your honesty is more virtuous than your kindness
DC goes dark and serious so Marvel thought they'll go full blown stupid now. Fantastic.
I was expecting to be disappointed by this movie because of how bad it would be. But after watching it, it’s more accurate to say I’m disappointed because I can see so much potential that the film had. I think this film could have been better than Ragnarok if it had taken itself a little more seriously. The Christian Bale’s acting was incredible but the character deserved more time to show why he’s both a terrifying and sympathetic character. The god he kills at the start is also _way_ to obviously despicable (it’s a little heavy handed). The Taika Waititi voice overs felt weird. The screaming goats were over played. The “love triangle” between the weapons isn’t funny to me. The children army is a bit too cheesy. Lastly, I can’t quite buy that the God Butcher would’ve entrusted his daughter’s life to Thor. Recruiting an army of children isn’t a good look for an adult looking to adopt. But the visuals were stunning, the acting was incredible, and there were elements of a truly incredible storyline that I feel wasn’t fully capitalized on.
Well I guess we just have to see some movies in a way that they aren't good or make sense. As long as it's not every single phase 4 film then I don't have a problem with 1 or 2 shit ones
next Thor will be throwing pixie dust.
Was just shite . Disaster from start to finish. I asked for my money back and went to see Top Gun.
Every time I watch a Marvel Movie, I assume it's going to be bad or more of the same. That allows me to relax and enjoy, and I did enjoy the movie. It is NOT Ragnarok, but it's funny and entertaining. It's sad people take everything seriously and just can relax.
I was on board until the floating head showed up
Meh. Not feeling this 'humour' at all. I wasn't a fan of Ragnarok but Love and Thunder was excruciating.
My problem with this movie was they just tried to make everything into a joke. I think I laughed twice in this movie and both times it was a variation on the exact same joke. If you've seen the movie it's when Corg messes up Jane's name. I don't  mind humor in these movies it's just beginning to be too much.
Bro, blink twice if Kevin Fiege is holding you hostage. You are being a little too positive for how bad this movie was.
Terrible movie that jumps all over the place with a lousy script.... Even when it is trying to be serious it still is comedy and so silly..  Natalie Portman's character feels non-existent in this movie and jumps in and out all over the place. 4.5/10  that is how bad it is compared to the better Marvel and DC movies which I am not a big fan of the comic books, but I watch the movies. Whoever is writing these scripts for Marvel movies and Marvel episodes has no idea what they are doing... Obi Wan had some very lazy script writing as well..
They absolutely butchered the whole movie complete crap I was so disappointed my expectations were so high for gor the god butcher I was completely let down
Love and Thunder was not representative of Thor marvel it sucked which is so hard for me to say bc love Marvel but this sucked. Did Marvel loose it's writers. How did this movie 🎥 pass quality control. Maybe Marvel needs to hire Marvel fans before making a movie so they can give them better ideas..  Just like this reviewer says the actors were great. I feel they used too  much comedy in such a way that it made Thor a joke the story does not make you connect to the movie. They ruined Thor......not Chris Hemsworth.....Love Thor character and probably why I even watched this movie....Just please produce better writing stop ruining  movies. It's like your writing movies to fit some agenda and not stick to Marvel comics. She hulk sucks for the same reason and This movie is not great but to no fault of the awesome actors the fault lies completely on the writers.   The actors is what made the movie bearable the writing made movie cringe worthy mixed in with an occasional joke which truely made me so sad truly sometimes didn't even want to laugh bc the movie so cringey that didn't feel good to even laugh.....this was so bad that now only hope they redeem themselves and go back to better writing. Thor and his fellow actors deserve that much and so do Marvel fans. Please do not end the Thor movies with this diaster of a movie. Please instead bring back Thor better quality movies. I hope the actors don't quit bc they are all awesome.  Wish I knew who are the people pushing writers to away from Marvel comic stories and instead writing there own agendas into the movie making them cringe worthy
Finally saw the movie free on Disney Day. The opening on the blue-people planet  was so FUCKING Stupid. Thor was made into a clown. He couldve got the goats in any other number of ways. Taika really is an idiot. Adios from Marvel and Star Wars forever, I hope.   Anyway the rest of the film was pretty good. The kids with Thor powers was adorable. Loved that Jane & Thor got back together and Jane went to Valhalla. Would love to see Thors Mom greet her at the gates ❤️
This was beyond bad! I’m ready to cancel my Disney+ subscription Marvel is literally putting out garbage now
They stopped making marvel movies for older people that young kids would enjoy. Now it literally kid movies as cheesy as cartoons. These are going to be awful movies coming up.
Ok, let me start by saying this movie ranks right there with Black Widow, Godzilla vs Kong, Wonder Woman 84.  Thor has been reduced to the mentally challenged Avenger (No offence to any challenged persons) Hemsworth has relegated himself to roles of a quasi- idiotic characters to the point where I don't want to see him in another movie.  And, furthermore is Marvel ever does another Hulk movie Keep everyone that had something to do with this movie AWAY from that movie, producers, directors, writers, everyone.
I like that Chris sees things from a professional point of view, noting everyone’s hard work that we don’t normally see… yet I see it from a theatrical point of view, the story was bad and the jokes were lame
I hated it. Just outright hated it. It felt like a parody what’s sadder is a parody of what? This adaptation of Thor seems like it could launch Thor into a second rate superhero. It’s like if Marvel bought out “The Boys” comic books and Amazon series just to fuck it up but is leaving it to the fans to decide that.
This movie sucked
Superb acting,sadly the movie felt rushed and more caterd to a younger generation who don’t mind spending a tonne on merchandise;
you talk about the marketing instead of the movie itself? this is too nice of a review, play it safe yeah?
None of the movie makes any sense because they can't figure out where they're going to have the chronology of characters my understanding was is that everyone had died including Lady sieve and the warriors 3 and now that's not the case They picked till now to have the whole Jane Foster relationship and explain that they were not going to work out for me if you spend time and effort developing something just to have it completely torn apart does not make any sense that's just stupid The movie has a hole wasn't as bad as I thought it would be there too many characters is way too much going on simultaneously to really pick and choose anything bad do I like Russell Crowe in this movie no I don't There's clearly been the wrong direction with all of what marvel has been doing the last 5 years it's gone from bad to worse and they don't know what they're doing right now they had a really good beginning and a decent middle but right now everything will come out with has been very boring and kind of blah This movie as a whole isn't bad but it's not as good as let's say the second film
The movie sucked! There; I said it.
no mention on how woke it is? really?
I really liked the final act with both Thors teaming up and the kids getting powers. Clever ending. However, earlier scenes some of the humor seemed a bit silly slapstick thrown in or ad lib at times. Effects and locations were beautiful. I like humor like in Ragnorak, but sometimes they go too far. Overall I would give the film a B+.
Have you noticed in the first battle (at the Crystal Temple), one of the tanks sounds a droideka's gun from Star Wars ? 🙂
Movie was atrocious. Worst marvel movie so far.
I thought the movie was really good. But I felt something was missing from a thor movie. Or someone.  It's loki. We should have had a loki cameo
This is nothing like the Thor from Comicbooks.. WTF?  This movie was made for 10 year old.. So cheesy and Gay.. The Valkyrie is Gay.,.Korg talking about two fathers and Zeus talking about Orgies..  And this suppose to be a family movie you can show your kids? Disney and there hidden ways..
We need Storm (X-Men) Thor collaboration⚡️
This movie was one of the worst Thor franchise movies but it wasn't as bad as I expected. As Chris said it, "visually dazzling, funny, entertaining but not worth watching more than once". If you've lost someone precious due to illness, this movie may make you emotional and almost cry (as I did).
Thor 4 like watching wonder woman 1984. Leaps and bounds worse than the previous movies.
I enjoyed the movie, I was very surprised Taika managed to slip in a mention of our war god Tumatauenga or that Maori girl sitting amongst the other gods. But I felt the film was to stupid, like overload, I couldn't process the film properly because of it, in scenes where it should have been taken seriously in terms of what was going on. Like it's hard to explain like I couldn't take the film seriously and I wasn't able to engage with what the character could be going through. When a scene I thought should be serious BAMB there's more silliness, in the end I just watched it to laugh and ignored everything else. Tough to explain.
Saw this today, and it was all I feared it to be. Taika can go beep himself. I dont ever want him to touch the MCU again. Bale was great as the villain, and COMPLETELY wasted in this crapshow of a movie. The comedy is mostly dumb. The only good idea is Jane being able to wield Mjolner for the reason she is. But its a serious idea, wasted in a kindergarten of a movie. PLEASE TAIKA STAY AWAY FROM THE MCU!
U.S.A. lost, title of the best movie 2023
Hollywood´s produce getting more adicted and cheaper every year.
FAKE NEWS: Lies of trump , by the way I´m European....

what was it : "Kindle or Kimmel?"
Given the choice of watching  love and thunder again or being reinfected with covid  I would choose covid.  At least with covid I would have a 99% chance of living.  I fear we're rewatching  love and thunder would kill an honest man. (  Upper case letters were omitted in love and thunder due to the fact  the movie was not worthy)
all like Jimmy
what a flob
drunk amd drugs adiction actors, B or C film
Some dry jokes were antagonising like the screaming goats
Can someone answer this question for me so in Thor we see Odin enchant mjolnir right but then in Thor ragnarok with him dying we see his enchantment gets released right? So why does captain America and Jane get Thor powers because he also told him that mjolnir wasn’t the score but a way of focusing his power so after Odin died they should just be picking up a heavy hammer?
Another woke wet fart from Disney and marvel.  This is worse than the last doctor strange but not as bad as Ms marvel.  Something about going woke trying to appeal to every demographic is alienating your original base.  I haven't liked a marvel movie since Civil war.
What did Chris stuckmann give this movie for a rating
Thor ragnarok was on the same level as thor 1 and 2, all mid
The MCU unfortunately doesn’t feel the same anymore.
Im not feeling Thor gf at all in the movie it should of been about Gorr VS Thor more
Did I miss it? Or this Chris really not review Jurassic World Dominion
Boring film
Just watched the movie. Not good in any way. Horrible story.
With Displate you can be scammed and get paid just a couple bucks... if you are an artist and designer for them.
seems like every movie reviewer thinks hes a writer, director, editor and even an actor. those who cant do, review. i think the thor movies are turning into a fucking comedy, i like the first ones. i like it more serious and not a joke.
Phase 4 is definitely more of an aftermath of Endgame and almost filler-ish for the MCU to introduce new heroes plus view some of the heroes' character journey. Definitely Shang-Chi and Spiderman are the high points of the Phase 4. Big fan of Shang-Chi comics and glad they finally adapted him and maybe one day the Five Weapons Society.
This was definitely one of the films ever.
All the marvel movies coming out lately have been trash.  I'm Done with marvel
Has anyone else gotten the "Text me on telegram" scam?  I keep getting it on multiple videos.
I was pretty much forced to watch this last night, I wish I didn't. Do not watch this film, it is very bad. And don't even start with those fucking goats.
At the beginig I thought it was the Trailer for Mad Max the lrgend of Furiosa lol until I realize wait a minut is Furiosas father Christian Bail???
The original comic book story is a dramatic piece. It feels like they replaced the drama with weak comedy to set it as the base for the movie, then tried to garnish it with drama. I would've preferred it the other way around.
You saying Taika Waititi physically restraining himself from making a joke during a serious moment really translated into this film. He's such a magnificent talent, but his biggest issue is tone and respecting serious moments.
This film was great! It was a fun theatre watch and I felt connected with its characters and plot. However I feel like it had a lot more potential to really be one of the best
I hope there is a director's cut
Thor is my absolute favorite character; in movies and comics. Jason Aaron’s female/unworthy Thor story arc is AMAZING. One of the best I’ve ever read. And Taika’s 6 year old bullshit irreverence absolutely ruined what should have been the best Thor movie. It took me a while to accept that this movie sucks… I didn’t want to admit it.  And I saw top gun 8 times.. lol
Video starts at 2:10. Up to then it’s just sponsored section.
There was way too many jokes in this movie and I just don’t even see the reason to even have Korg in this movie. He was just there making joke after joke. The ending fight acne when Thor gave all those kids the power of Thor and the kid with the stuffed rabbit having lightning shooting out of its eyes. I was just annoyed of this movie for me it’s like a 4 out of 10
The major opinion I had with the movie is that I felt like Thor being with the Guardians was a good opportunity, but clearly 3 minutes in and it was treated like a mistake.
Me personally, I really loved the movie, however I do feel like gorr could’ve been a bit better as a character. Also this is coming from a person that has loved Thor as a character since 5 :)
So unprofessional for a director and actress to talk shit about the CGI team and their unpolished work, maybe these aholes instead of learning a few lines and telling people what to do, can learn how to use 3d graphic engines and renders instead of talking trash....
Storytelling and character development will always suffer when written based on an agenda or political message. To much politics over there for me these days so I don’t bother with these films anymore.
Bro is such a soft liberal now
WHAT? TOP GUN???? That was so bad
Natalie Portman ruined another Thor movie.
This was one of the BIGGEST, no in fact THE BIGGEST disappointment in my 50 yrs of watching movies...I use to work with Warner Brothers... desired to work with the gaffers on set... man I'm sure those involved it the making of this film, at least those tenured in their crafts were waiting for wrap up... watching this was like pulling teeth...so much so after 16 minutes...I pulled the plug.  Wanting to not be overly "judgemental" I tried again...just couldn't sit through it... Oh "Marvel" how you have lost your MARVEL...Disney has turned you into a "Fantasy Land"!!  🤢🤮
Chris, I gotta say man, I'm just not sure this "don't talk about what I dislike" thing is a little overboard. In fact, I get why you're doing it. It makes sense, y'know, cuz you have a movie being made and obviously it would suck to be criticized about something you've made when you've criticized films heavily in the past (yourself). I'm not saying your film will be bad... but criticism is still criticism at the end of the day. People (hopefully) learn from criticism, not get deterred from it. You'll always be a critic first in my eyes, filmmaker second. You don't have to hate on a film like maybe you've done in the past, but maybe more videos like this where you talk about what you liked about the movie (and maybe what you would've done a little differently yourself) would always be nice. Constructive criticism, more-or-less.
I'll be honest, I respect Chris for going after his dreams and trying to become a director, but his reviews lately have been no reviews but kinda minesweeper games where he consistently tries to avoid any criticism towards the movie, I get it that he's got a new perspective and approach to reviewing movies but I wish he kinda went back to his old style reviews.
See rrr chris
M She U?
The comedy was good but then got overdone. But overall it was an entertaing movie. I had enough of serious marvel movies and this movie atleast had a slight different approach.
thor love of thunder was better then orther phase 4 movies mcu
Love and Thunder was as disappointing as Dead Pool 2. They both put way too many gags in the films.
Would love them to do a full movie of Thor with the Guardians Of The Galaxy ... Really love the Thor & Starlord back & forth
This movie was hard to sit through. To many  corny jokes that weren’t even funny that are very uncharacteristic of the God Thunder.   To stupid of an encounter with Zeus which made him seem like some type of fruit loop God. This movie just seemed like it was done by a kids comedy show writer, instead of anyone that has experience with action hero’s. I’m totally disappointed.
Recently I have felt that I am experiencing what everybody calls superhero fatigue. The last two movies, doctor strange and thor were moderate at best. I did not enjoy myself as much. The movies seem adequate at best, the characters felt cartoonish, the story was not engaging and I found myself yawning quite a lot. Especially thor was really disappointing. After the widely popular and fun Ragnarok, this venture was surprising in the sense that the same cast and same director could produce such a joke of a movie. I did laugh in the movie but that was a pity laugh and I was laughing at how bad a movie could be. Many believe that it was not as bad. I myself felt that I wasted my money. I did not enjoy the movie. The superhero movies are not the same. I find myself falling out of love with these kinds of movies. I think I do not have the heart of a 10-year-old anymore. I have grown I guess. I love the mature content. I love something that I could relate to. For instance, I love the boys. I love the Zack Snyder iteration of superhero movies. They have a heavy tone and contain mature content that I can resonate with. The fart jokes are not funny anymore. The audience has grown along with the movies. After such heavy movies like endgame and infinity war, going back to silly things are idiotic on the part of Marvel. Finding a balance between what you cater to the mature audience all the while keeping the children interested is the trick and Marvel should learn better to walk that fine line. But as things stand they are leaning over to the side of making small children happy. Thus, the reason for people’s low rating of recent movies. Superhero fatigue is real and has caught up to me. I don’t think I will see any of the Marvel movies unless they promise something new and mature.
Oh good you didn't like the movie I was gonna question your logic and reason or if your bought off.
Definitely wasn’t that great and it could’ve been a lot better.
... I did not care for Ragnarok and not very excited for this one ...
I disagree Chris. This movie was not at all very funny, and felt incredibly forced with its comedy.
As someone who didn't like Ragnarok at all, considering one of the worst Marvels because I felt that none of the jokes landed, all being cringe. This review makes me glad I decided to pass on it, granted I been behind on a lot of movies but, I don't think I will ever bother with Thor 4. And I only apply directors jail for Franchise movies. Granted I mostly dislike the style of Marvel jokes that started since 2012 Avengers, but Ragnarok jokes were specially worse timed and less quality.  But I did consider giving it a chance due to JoJo Rabbit, which I didn't found that groundbreaking either. In fact felt lots of it's potential was undermined by lots of hit or miss jokes though I liked only on the basis of the big tragic moment halfway landing, even if the latter half lacked the weight it should had.   I also think his jokes were the weaker aspect of his Mandalorian episode which otherwise is solid though he didn't write it. I also feel very mixed on the upcoming Waititi's Star Wars movie, and I hope he gets replaced by someone willing to cut out all the bad jokes.
I hated it even more than the previous film.
This film is hot trash.
they ruined Thor change my mind
The movie would've have been much better if they went with a darker theme. I mean the villain is literally called the "God Butcher". Should've been Gorr BUTCHERING Gods.
I actually liked this better than ragnorok
capping lately
It’s weird asking but here goes nothing... Can you please start giving honest reviews again I don’t know 🤷🏽‍♂️ if it’s Taika Waitititi spelled wrong 😑 on purpose, that’s got critics scared buh nobody will give an honest review about this terrible movie 🍿 they all hide behind it has good visuals so does a 🌹 buh it also has thorns 🥀 if you grab on to it, this was a bad movie 🎥 The Best Thing About Coming To This Channel Was An Honest Review!
Unfortunately it wasn't a good movie. Bale was great, Hemsworth was overdoing the absurd Thor facial expressions. Try and way too hard to be funny with most of the jokes not landing right. Trying way too hard which came off as needy instead of funny.  Editing was horrible I thought because they didn't show anything about the backstory of how Natalie Portman's character became lady thor. She just all of a sudden showed up as lady Thor with pretty much one line explaining how. What the heck were they doing not showing us how that happened. Isn't that a crucial part of the movie plot that we want to see happen on screen? The screaming goats were a little bit funny but mostly juvenile and weird..... And then again Thor is trying way too hard to entertain us coming off as needy with his relationship with Natalie Portman. I acted like people who didn't even really like each other for half of the movie. She just full-on ignores him at events they are doing etc as if he's just some random guy she met for 5 minutes 10 years ago and doesn't even care about. Thor is again looking needy watching her like some love sick weirdo looking needy again.  The movie was very odd. Most of it was high quality and done pretty well and the action was amazing. Thor's hammer splitting apart and coming back together and battle was incredible. Some of that was done very well but only some. Most of the movie felt like they were trying way too hard, they allowed too much creative freedom of weird badly edited plot lines. It's like they just said go crazy and do your weird thing on this movie and that's what the director did. He made it weird. Not in a good way, an off  putting way.  Parts of it were good but this movie should have been so much better than it actually was. They did under use Christian Bale. His character didn't have much to do in the movie at all. The scene with Russell Crowe and talking to the gods was kind of funny but also again odd. That weird little curtsy move with the skirt that Russell Crowe does I guess was supposed to be funny but again odd.  Compared to how good Ragnarok was this seemed like a garbage. It was barely entertaining enough garbage because we like the characters but it really wasn't that good compared to what it should have been. Why did they cut out all the story showing major plot lines like how Natalie Portman become the lady Thor? Why didn't we get better dialogue and interaction between her and Thor? Why did she act like he annoyed her and didn't care to see him instead of giving a damn that he was there? She basically traded Thor like he was a bellhop or waiter most of the movie, like he was just getting in her way. Very poor movie. I still liked it because it's Marvel but it did not live up to Marvel quality at all.
I probably understand why are you pulling your punches which may keep your professional career ahead  but this isn't you used to be... You should be direct with your criticism as you used to before
This movie was an absolute train wreck. Everyone was gay and crying all the time  Way to go eisners...  Walt was right about you people!
It was the 2nd best Thor behind Ragnarok. If they would have show and built up Gorr like they did with Helia, it would have been a better movie. It just felt rushed the interactions between the heroes and main villian to where it didn't feel like he was a threat at all. When they beat him it was like a Goku vs Pikkon and not a Goku vs Cell or Freiza.
Honestly this movie seemed very dumb to me.
Ragnorak was also terrible
Movie review turned into a talk about how actors talk about the movie
Am quaterway into this movie and am not impressed at all. The concept of God completely escapes marvel producers and directors, writers. If it can die its not a God. Marveled have never gotten thor right. He is a DEMI-GOD MEANING he should be immortal, he shouldn't have human blood running through his veins, he should be able to drink as much beer as he wants and not get a beer belly, or exercise to lose weight ect ect ect. In his movies he is powerful yet when placed with the avengers Ironman  is a March for thor?  Am sorry but the more movies marvel make the more these characters lose everything that made them awesome to begin with.  And this movie sorry but I just couldn't take this thing seriously. I think people need to remove the rose colored glasses and see these movies really see them. The comedy in this movie didn't work it was quite ridiculous, zues was simply a nonsense and mythicaly speaking how can anyone in any marvel movie have zues so comical ahhhh  this in my book was an epic fail
Are you saying you review movies the way Brad Pitt does snatch and grab jobs [Bullet Train]?
Any criticism is good, film maker or not. Just use it constructively.
Not to mention Marvel mandated that the film had to be under 2 hrs long
This movie felt like a really long Old Spice deodorant commercial
This movie was just bad. It undermined everything created before for cheap laughs. "Marvel stopped caring ..."
Honestly I had high expectations for Thor. The movie was trying too hard to be funny to the point where it became underwhelming and cringey. We were also introduced to characters that randomly came in, so it felt weird not knowing who these characters were. Jane came in with powers she's had for like one second, and easily knows how to use her powers efficiently. Which is dumb how she defeats the god butcherer, I didn't like Jane in the previous movies or even in this one, she's just there, idk tho
It's dogshit
Chris, how come you haven't reviewed The Gray Man? I'm convinced that you and Jeremy are ignoring the movie on purpose, with big names like Ryan Gosling, Chris Evans and Ana De Armas it's impossible to not have heard about it. Please review it man.
Movie 🎥 was shit
video starts at 2:10
I just got back from seeing it. I didn’t think it was as bad as everyone was saying, but I felt like this movie had an identity crisis. The highs were high, but the lows were really low, there was a lot of cringey shit in this movie. But everything with Gorr’s storyline and the fight scenes were really damn good. Christian Bale stole the show.  I liked it better than Black Widow, but it’s the second worst phase 4 movie for me.  No Way Home Shang Chi Eternals Multiverse of Madness Love and Thunder Black Widow
Just finished watching it and I liked the movie Mabye its because my hopes were so low due to the internet saying it was bad, but even with its problems it still stood on its own
There have been a few Marvel films that I thought weren’t all that great, but I still enjoyed them. This ain’t one of those. This is the first Marvel film I thought was really bad. Like, never watch again, can never get those 2 hours back, bad. It went too hard in the comedy, and the movie suffered because of it. Had the tone of the film fit more with Christian Bale’s character and story, I feel this could have been one of the better MCU films, but to me Bale was wasted here. I loved Ragnarok. Thought Goldblum and The Grandmaster were very good fits for the story and tone that film. Unfortunately, this film was missing that fit and leaned too heavily on the gags when less humor would have been better. And I’ve seen Top Gun 4 times. The last three times at thanks to my daughter who keeps asking to see it. We were going to see Bullet Train Friday night, but when she saw Top Gun was still in theaters, we had to change plans. It’s such a great film. Better than the first one. Yes, I said it. Keep doing what you’re doing, Stuckman. I’ve definitely been Stuckmanized.
The scene where Thor is talking to the kids in that cage, by whatever it's called... to get their location, to save them... where he needs to be confident and in control to ease the kids fear, and help them stay strong.... and you have Valkyrea messing with him, by using a feather or something to brush his nose...  That scene for me, tells you all you need to know about the tone of this film...  Valkyrea is supposed to be the king of the Asguardians... these children are her peoples children... in fact there entire community of children... and in such an important moment, that could determine their survival and rescue, she is playing around like a child... she knows what he is doing, she knows the kids can see this... and she knows he needs to concentrate 100% to do what he is doing, and it just makes no sense...  It's comedy for the sake of comedy, despite the situation and whether it fits or not.  The film is riddled with moments like this, and it stops this film from being beyond just okay and kind of meh
Marvel movies need to remember to have heart. I think Marvel Studios still has a lot of creative heart left, since they made Shang-chi and No Way Home, and are about to release the movie with the most heart, Black Panther 2. They might make many mediocre movies as well, but honestly, it's only going to get harder to get the creative spark going rather than easy.
Huh...... And Still no Matrix Review from one of my Favorite Reviewers....???  Chris must have REALLY hated it ! wow......
Terrible movie
The movie was really difficult for me to watch, since my father was recently diagnosed with terminal cancer... So, by the end, I was crying... So now I have some bittersweet connection with the movie... Don't know how else to describe it...
I liked it. I tend not to enjoy MCU movies but this had quite a lot of ideas that I liked which, while messy, don't seem to dropped after the first act beyond just mentioning it (which I think is a common Marvel problem). I also find that a lot of MCU stuff feels the need to apologise about how silly it is and while this is one of the silliest yet it doesn't seem emberassed about it.
So funny it missed the PLOT!  DUMB!! 🤬😡
For me this movie was fun at times I didn't think I would love two giant screaming goats but here we are I give this movie a meh + I liked it but an not planning on watching again.
awful in every way.
Dreadful movie, so disappointing, I wouldn’t know where to begin with it. I just think they turned up and made stuff up on the day,. Don’t believe there was a script, made it up as they went along.
Trailer: 10/10  Actual Movie: 2/10
I didn’t spend $10 to see Chris Hemsworth naked! I wanted to see my boi Gorr slaughtering some gods!
At least Shang Chi didn’t make me physically recoil in cringe
The fact that Chris Hemsworth said that the movie feels like it was made by a seven year old really just speaks volumes to me.
This movie was a major disappointment for me. Way to silly and cringey and didn’t show the villain nearly as much as I wanted them to. They also kept being really lighthearted, but would randomly jump into really dark topics really fast which was honestly just uncomfortable. Plus the Guardians of the Galaxy are only in the movie at the very beginning and we don’t see them again afterwards.

I don't care what u say, This movie was Absolute Dog Shit, From the dumb trying to be funny scenes, to the wasted potential of Gorr, to the stupid fact that everyone and anyone can use storm breaker, this was worse than Thor the Dark World, Absolutely dog shit, the director Really messed up trying to be even funnier then Thor Ragnorok, this proves he cannot Potray the real Thor, The Russo brothers are probly laughing, this was So bad, Only marvel fan boys who are delusional would say this was good, I will keep saying this, Marvel sucked after endgame, their best work stopped at Infinity War
Absolutely wasted potential of Gorr!!!
Too much comedy and stupidity. Thor’s other movies were pretty good but I can’t take this one serious. It’s just forgettable.
Fanboys are scared of harshly criticizing an MCU movie
So, you're a brown noser now? Should your reviews ever be taken seriously at all anymore? To me, you need to have integrity in everything and anything that you do. The moment you no longer have that integrity, you'll just accept anything. Like you have this movie.  Love and Thunder was trash, and so is X-Men Apocalypse, but you liked that film too. How does it make any sense that if you review bad films it somehow interferes with your aspiration of being a director? I really don't follow that logic. To me, you're just saying you're a sellout in an effort to further your own goals.  You're just boring now, Chris. Unbelievably boring and predictable.
It feels like you're afraid to review movies and say what you actually think and if that's the case i don't think you should do it anymore, i can't trust you're being genuine when you feel like acknowledging the bad aspects of something means you're a bad person ... reviews are supposed to inform, discuss and give perspective...and you're not doing that which is unfortunate, good luck with your film
did you beard just got.... rounder?
I don’t get why Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness got so much hate yet so many let this one slide.
Was very disappointed with this movie. Marvel definitely could’ve done better and unlike Thor The Dark World this one was just cringey not boring.
Thor is now a Frat bro…HE RODE THE AXE LIKE THE WICKED WITCH ARE YOU KIDDING ME…Disney turned this into a kids movie for the simple fact of selling merch and having kids beg their parents to buy the toys and let them see it…they lost the idealism of Thor, he’s supposed to be serious arrogant and cocky he’s a GOD now he’s an idiot doing Jean Claude van damn splits…when you make Starlord look like an intellectual it’s a problem…HE POURED BEER ON HIS AXE !!! And we end with Thor babysitting a kid and cooking breakfast with an apron MAJOR CUCK VIBES
Chris, no offence , but it's sad to hear that, while being a filmmaker , you liked " Ragnarok ", and that you kinda' endorsed " Love and Thunder"...
I am one of the rare people that actually enjoyed it. I went in with low expectations and was prepared for it to be rapid fire silly jokes. I wasn't really looking for it to be anything more than a light hearted, campy rom-com and it didn't let me down. I had a pretty heavy week, and to be honest it's exactly what I needed.
Marvel lost me a long time ago. I enjoy this review more than any marvel movie lately
I remember when u did great reviews. Now you just advertise disc plates  Sad.
Why bother with anything if anything you make sells billions. Just like shitty McDonald's burgers.
ONE THING I CAN SAY ABOUT CHRIS IF HE SAY A MOVIE IS GOOD OR BAD I TRUST HIS JUDGMENT I'M TELLING YOU THIS MAN HAS A EYE FOR THESE TYPE OF MOVIES I have been following this man for years now I might always agree but he has a eye when it comes to these movies I wish I had money to help with his project because he deserves it
I just came back from the cinema and man it was disapointing. I found there was huge imbalance between comedy and serious moments. I heard that Taika Waititi was forced to fit the 2h time and there is a lot of the movie missing. Gorr should definitely get more screen time.
Dreadful movie. I feel there is a lot of punch pulling going on here.. it’s like sparring with your kids 🤪
A real shit movie
Hey Chris, been a fans of yours for years. I can't wait to see what you bring to the big screen man, nowhere to go but up for you
Thor dkt Malaysia c blh tyg
Honestly, I thought it was shit.
Thor Love and Thunder was garbage! Period.
Christian Bale as Gorr was wasted,,,,, taika or i guess you can say the producers dropped the ball
They had Russel Crow, Sam Neil, Matt Damon and f*ing Christian Bale, THEY HAD ONE JOB, making an awsome Thor movie, instead Waitiki made a stupid ass movie, irrelevant, idiotic, boring peace of crap...
i kinda wanted this movie to be the end of thor. i feel like it should have ended with thor dying to save the children and gorr coming to his senses realising not all gods are evil and selfish
The movie was shit....
What about the decision to make Thor an idiot? He felt like the Chris Hemsworth's character from Ghostbusters 2016.
Piece of excrement movie!
Ragnarok is highly overrated, there are some good elements in it and it contrasts with the previous tone in the Thor movies to make it enjoyable to some audiences (particularly kids) but it was not a great movie. Just like black panther and other movies in the MCU it is mysteriously overrated. It must be because someone of color is a main protagonist or director because frankly I see no other reason.
The movie belongs in the trash can. Period
it's such a dissapointment because the movie is a 2 hour long SNL sketch. my god the movie cannot be serious for more than 2 minutes. i expected a darker movie considering how dark the story is in the comics, but Taika Watiti ruins any emotional scene with so many pointless scenes and jokes. there's literally a scene where valkyre and natalie portman are standing in a doorway with a speaker while they bob their heads. oh also christian bale killed it for the seven minutes he's in the movie
Bad review. This movie is trash with no storyline. Just political agenda. My last MCU and Disney movie.
kinda sucks how big chris has become that he holds back certain criticism due to the nature of his networking, but i feel like its clear no one really tried in this one
Phase Four has been bland, End game was a big act to follow, actually... thinking about it, Phase Four feels like filler.
It wasn't the best Marvel movie but I think everyone is hating on it a little too much. There were really fun scenes and the comedy was mostly on point. Some of the plot points could have been done better but I reckon it's the same for most movies. The fact that we didn't see Gor killing more gods was the only thing I genuinely didn't like about this movie.
I'm conflicted about the way Marvel has handled Thor's character. It went from mildly funny but strong and cool to a never ending joke for me. The serious scenes feel out of place in such a crazy movie.
This movie was absolutely garbage in my opinion. I fell asleep at the hokey jokey vibe. It felt like a huge cash grab and just a waste of time. Sorry to be so harsh
I didn't love it, Jane and Thor's make up was too quick and I didn't get AT ALL why she was now Mighty Thor, STEALING HIS NAME,  and I really love the song Sweet Child O' Mine, very disappointing for me when it didn't play during the final fight, Thor was too goofy during serious scenes, like yes, he's a bit of an idiot, but he shouldn't act like one all the time, and I felt like too much of the focus was on Jane, this might just be me though, Thor is like my favorite character, but whatever
I feel like if Gorr (who was GREAT) had to have underlings (aka the shadow monsters), they could have been much more interesting. Imagine if Gorr could summon the gods he had killed to fight for him. Every time Thor and Co. entered a fight we would be wondering "ooooh, which god are they going to fight this time?" Could have made the fight scenes much more interesting in my opinion.
It’s a woke piece of garbage like most everything  else that Disney and Marvel are spewing out.
Just be honest man. If you don't like a film say that. Your film will either be great or it won't. Doesn't change your opinion on other films. I subscribed because I liked your honesty, so don't hold back. Good luck with your film.
This Thor moviewas the biggest pile of crap I have seen, someone needs to fire the writer/director who hasn't done anything worthwhile in years. Stop feminizing and wokeing the hero, let's see some real men play these characters....
Horrible movie,felt like it was for 6 year old kids
You need to stop call them reviews if you don’t rate them, we get it the movies shit just say so.
Hell no kick tiki to the curve plz omg he juss killed thor
It was pretty bad. Trying too hard to be funny.
Bale was in the wrong movie.
Wow you anny me now. Terrible movie.  I'm positive yours wiiiiiilllll be worse.
So is this not a review channel anymore? I want the positive and negative. This is the first video I see where it feels like you're making excuses for the movie. I get that you empathize with them but it's ok to have constructive criticism.
Too much comedy, just tiring
Yeah, OK.   Of course you felt that way... protect the income.
I actually kept falling asleep during this movie... which hasn't happened to me since I was a kid.  The movie was kind of dumb, and had so much wasted potential.  Like REALLY wasted.
Love the shirt 🔥
Yes Taika Waititi (apologize if misspelled) cannot go more than 60 seconds without making a joke as this movie is a great example of that
No Elvis Review ?
Zeus was terrible
Wonder how many kids watched this movie asking what an orgy was afterwards.
This bloke also said NOPE was good. Can't take your opinion with much weight anymore.
We saw last nite with no expectations because everyone said it sucked...could not believe how much we enjoyed it. Exactly why u really got to see 4 urself because what sucks to one is loved by another. It's the kind of movie I will purchase and rewatch every few years and sorry, but so glad we didn't listen to all u guys.
It is funny how both movies, Ragnarok and this, had great villains played by incredible actors that were criminally underused.
Yes!
I wanted to like this movie coz I'm a big fan of MCU. Sadly it is my worst movie in phase 4. The Harry Potter scene at the end has just become the worst scene in the entire MCU. Thor seriously needs a new director! WaititiOut
We should have just left it at End Game. After that it's all full of leftist's liberal identity garbage. Pure trash.
Can you do a review of Elvis?
wow, now I remember why I don't watch this dude anymore
Seriously Chris, you should quit reviewing all together if you can’t make reviews of bad movies. I understand why it is weird to do that, but you’re literally not doing half your job.
Thor hasn’t been the same since Infinity War. That’s was the best version of Thor. This movie was way to goofy. Did not like it
Not good, 5 popped corns
Uh.. no. People aren't saying "idk how to talk about this movie".. they're clearly saying they don't like it. There are people who just like to he entertained: marvel has gained many people in that category. But the real audience hated it.
Lol?
Love & Thunder is to Ragnarok what Wonder Woman 84 was to Wonder Woman.
ELVIS
The movie is crap
chris its tota\l shite..just say it
The definition of playing devil's advocate
it was just an okay movie.. zeus part was honestly funny, but i hoped it was directed in a serious way..
I enjoyed this movie. Not as much as Ragnarok, but I'll watch it again when it comes out on Disney Plus.
This movie was like a monkey walked by and took a 💩 then a gorilla walked by and took a 💩 on the monkeys 💩 but not to be out done a hippopotamus taking a 💩 on top of everyone else's 💩 but not to be out done by the 💩 that is this piece of 💩 movie . Did I mention that it was 💩???? Okay 🤷🤦😂🤣
Very self indulgent. Are you making a movie yourself, cuz I hadn't heard that. But apparently it's the most amazing thing in the universe, cuz a movie has never been made before. Congrats. You're the first 👍
Just like Dr. Strange the plots are suffering post End Game in this phase
I thought that Thor love and thunder was very okay it just was that it was a parody of Thor and that the humor was too much but other than that I just thought also the tone didn’t fit the villain
Nobody gonna talk about all the unnecessary gay bullshit?
Do you watch the corridor crew? Their views about visual effects, production and movie making in general are really insightful.
I feel that Love and Thunder should and could have been a 2-parter.  It would have given all the new and returning supporting characters more depth, more focus on the sub plots and Bale a chance to develop his character.  Bale did a great job with what he had, but I agree, he was under utilised.  You don't waste a great actor and character like that! Valkerie also felt side lined in favour of Mighty Thor - those 2 stories could have been movies themselves, instead of being crammed into a Thor vehicle.   Also, the comedy would have been more balanced over a 2-parter, instead of being used at the expense of drama. I liked the movie, but I wanted to love it at least as much as Thor 3.  However, I won't dismiss another sequel with this team either, just balance the comedy and focus more on characterisation and have fewer sub plots.
still going on about ur movie, u like top gun , well your you longer have any creditability
They turned Thor into a corny jokester who whole personality changed movie would have better not out
I feel like the movie could've been good if it was less cringy cuz I get that marvel is supposed to be funny but the jokes in thor 4 aren't funny, they're just cringey. Ngl there were some good scenes but the other scenes had potential to be good if the cringiness didn't fuck them up.
I liked the movie I thought the visuals were good, Gorr was creepy and Thor while funny did some growing - probably one of my favorite phase 4 films
These are not Marvel movies anymore. These are Disney movies. They are live-action cartoons with comic book characters. They are aimed at children. That's all.
They made Thor into a comedian. It’s just joke after joke. I do like the screaming goats though.
I was very disappointed. I never asked for a lady Thor, the story was meh, the plot was average at best. Also there was way to much humor, It also felt like Thor wasn't the main character of his own movie, overall I give the movie 4.8 out of 10
this movie is beyond silly, this is not the THOR I grew up with, once again Christian Bale is amazing and his talents are wasted in this movie.
Eternals is only good movie so far in phase 4 after no way home.  In series it's moon knight and Hawk eye
It’s so cathartic to finally see people being honest about the MCU and not let their fandom blind them. They aren’t as amazing as everyone has been pretending they are.
I was reasonably excited to see this movie. I’m a huge fan of Ragnarok, I’ve seen it many times and it’s still as funny and exciting as the first time I saw it. But this was quite a disappointment. I was entertained, and I loved Chris Hemsworth and Christian Bale’s performances, even Tessa Thompson, but everything else felt rushed and half assed. The VFX and writing were super underwhelming. I also thought Natalie Portman’s performance left a lot to be desired. I can however say that I thought the conclusion was very satisfying. I also appreciate how they incorporated Mighty Thor. I was concerned she would awkwardly take Thor’s place and this would be Chris Hemsworth’s last movie, but I thought it was very fitting for her to pass on. It gave us a chance to see that version of the character on the big screen, yet we still get to have our mainline Thor and see him go on a few more adventures.
His reviews are boring now shame
Well…3 minutes in to this review and it still hasn’t actually started the review…I can tell you right now, you are not going to make a good film. Best of luck though, follow your passion.
They only good thing about this movie is they kill off Natalie Portman.
ok finally unsubscribed.. he is insufferable now. I guess he goes for - its a youtube channel about me, ME. while I thought of it - its a youtube channel reviewing movies. He brings up too much baggage because he is aspiring film maker and I did not subscribe to see some soft inoffensive takes and mental gymnastics to not insult someone somewhere, I just wanted normal review.
This was best Thor movie it was a good movie all around
Disappointed with this review.
I'd say the big reason it feels like there's less control from Marvel, and their output feels messier this "phase" is because I don't think they have a clear idea where they want to go next. Or rather...if they DO know where they want to take the franchise in a big-picture sense, they don't know what steps they need to take to get there just yet. So all the recent movies and shows end up feeling kind of aloof, because the sandbox they're playing in has had its pause button pushed, so to speak. And even though some of them are still great entertaining films in the own right, given that it's all a shared universe if the visionary in charge doesn't know how to navigate it to the next destination, that aloofness is gonna show no matter how good an instalment any individual makes.
“I won’t watch love and thunder again” sums this film up perfect.
hey chris where's your review of jurassic world dominion?
2 minutes of ads for an intro, no more critical reviews from a movie critic. Been a fan of this channel for a while but this video left me like this movie did, disappointed.
Watch it this weekend and thought the part about loosing your child was so sad.the part with the gadians of the gadians of the galaxies was funny but forced  .another thing that I see that is forced on the viewers is this gay  story ,woman likes woman  ,man likes man .I took my 10 yr old daughter to see this movie I think it's right to be exposing  children  too .this world is turned upside down enough already.
Just say it sucked, we heard it through your words
I loved Ragnarok and thought this movie was a waste of my time. Taika needs to stop sniffing his own farts...
Eternity, tho 👀
the movie feels like a parody, they try all sort of jokes in every scenes. when it's supposed to be serious, still got jokes. Thor has gone so far from a god to a damn joke. And the Gorr was butchered by the writing, he's barely in the movie and he doesn't do much for the god butcher. that's a main issue for Marvel as most of their villains are always forgettable, underutilized and weak that they exist because the heroes need villains.
I'm not disappointed. I thought it was a good movie.
Review starts at 2:10
I really hate how taikia's lack of quality and self-respect was apparent in this film. The vfx and sloppy cgi due to giving his team short deadlines and the overuse of comedy and failing to stick to Canon. The only reason his thor movies are decent is due to Kevin feige, the comics and the screenwriters who stay true to the comics as much as they can
It was...hammy. Like they took the humor that worked in Ragnarok and said "let's do way too much of that". Every scene was overly quippy. Even serious moments sit there for about 2.5 seconds before someone comes in with a one liner. Like if, in the middle of a drama, a main character is in a hospital bed, they die, and almost immediately, a guy runs in and cracks a joke. It just undercuts the dramatic moment for a cheap (attempt at a) laugh.
The screaming goats were so funny though hahaha 🤣
I personally really didn’t like this one. I felt it had some great moments but the pacing was completely wonk and the certain jokes were overused. There was too large a focus on jokes in general considering what the movie was actually about and the juxtaposition was just too jarring for my taste.
A meh! Review... I am surprised
I liked it. It made me feel like a kid again watching it. Which makes sense given the premise. But it also seems to play on the idea of protecting children and reminding the target adult audience of some happy nostalgia via colorful set design, narrative storytelling,   Comedy and cool action scenes. Saying that, would we really need to go that deep into a feel-good film?
Marvel tries to instill far too much bad comedy in their movies. This idea worked well in Iron Man. However, every title character spends far too much time being sarcastic and spewing out corny one-liners.
One of my favorite things about this movie is the shifts in tone depending on what's going on onscreen. Like, it feels like you're being told this story by korg while sitting around a campfire somewhere you know? The god parts are extra extravagant, the dark villainous parts are extra dark, the battles are like a romp through a playground, because of course korg wouldn't really tell a story about Thor that didn't have him confidentiality kicking butt!  Everything felt a click or two over the top, because that's how korg would tell the story, and it felt ike a really subtle way of making hamfisted stuff extra funny, or dark stuff extra dark.  Personally, I loved it, and the sideshow bob rakes rule totally applied to Thor's goats. Man that became almost my favorite part by the end of it. That is if course if it weren't for Russell Crowe's skirt flourish. Man what an outrageous movie, and a kinda fun pallet cleanser after the bigger releases recently.
This movie. SUCKS..BIG TIME**! Your honest opinion is not honest.  Shang chi, was as bad ,if not worse than this movie.  STAY OUT OF THE MOVIE CRITICS CHAIR...YOUR NOT ONE.
Heard it copied Star Wars where anyone can be a Jedi, now anyone can be a Thor. Bye-bye Marvel.
It's okay Chris, you can say this movie was a total shitshow and the only good thing about it was Gorr. It's alright, you're allowed. It sucked.
This movie was a great disappointment
Hi Chris. Indian fan here. Please watch RRR.
not weird at all to give a review for a movie you dont like if anything you could save a family or a couple from wasting there money on a bad film
Bro- the movie SUCKED! End of story.
Unsubbing. Go make your movie suck hole.
I watched  Thor 4, and I thought it was wonderful.
Worst review ever. It's like listening to a conversation between two kids during recess.
This movie is a giant joke
This movie is shit. I lose respect for you how much you danced around that fact. 😒
Fase 4 really sucked, with a few exceptions
This movie was cack; it’s like it was written by an ADHD child on speed and tonally it was all over the place. Someone butchering gods? Make a joke! Jane has cancer? Make a joke! Rinse and repeat with OTT messy visuals. Nah.
What's going on dude? It feels like you're pulling your punches on being a critic.
Whats going on is that Disney has taken away a loot of Kevin's power and say in things
The way Thor should be like is how he was in Infinity War. In that, he had some funny moments, but not at the cost of his character, and he was serious when needed.   Except No Way Home and Shang-Chi, this MCU phase has been quite underwhelming :/
Is this a channel aimed at average movie goers or film makers? There's definitely more in one group than the other.
This movie was horrible
Thor: Mid and Midder Patrick Ba- I mean Gore or whatever he is carried.
This movie was an embarrassment to Marvel
The Comic books were never intended to be movies.
All I can say is; poor Warriors Three.
I feel like 90% of the movie was a joke and 10% was the actual plot
it seems that finnaly the well has gone dry. i am just happy that the USA capitalist culture is going to stop forcing on us this super hero crap.
I liked it.  I didn't love it, but I liked it.  I liked it more than Ragnarok, to be honest.  I really thought Ragnarok was crap.  Portman, IMO, steals the movie.  She had by far the most interesting story, and while the end was somewhat predictable, I really felt the stakes.  Throwing a mortal in with the gods and superhumans was really effective in that way, and I think it paid off.  Some of the humor was a bit too cutesy, and having them broken up in the beginning of the movie kind of slows the movie down, but that isn't the movie's fault.  That decision was made beforehand in other movies.
ok so you are an industry brick now. we will never hear you say a movie is bad and why anymore because is bad for business. ok.
I enjoyed the 2nd half of the film more than the first because it got slightly more serious but still not enough. The first scene with gorr was the best. Man gorr could have been interesting but they ruined it (for the most part).
This movie is the kind that makes Martin Scorsese want to vomit. Comedy, action junk food. Overbearing
-"Plenty of the action was awesome"... Ya, but void of any real consequences or seriousness. It's all jokes. There's no feeling that the characters may fail at any point. Joking while people are laying their with their arm cut off. SMH -"I love Chris Hemsworth as Thor"... Me too, except in this movie they turned him into an absolute bumbling idiot.  -"Wonderful that Natalie Portman got to do something that was monumental".... Ya, better than Thor even though he's been training/fighting for millennia, while she picked up a hammer 5min ago. So forced. Where's the arc? -"Sequence with Russel Crowe as Zeus was really funny. A lot of the comedy really works for me".... What?! Shit was cringe my dude. Along with most the comedy in the movie.  Think the only thing you were right on was Bale and special effects, for the positives that is.
I love the Character, THOR.  But this movie was not good for me, it felt like a kiddie movie.  I was disappointed ☹️
I don't even know where to start. This Movie was just... so, so bad. Just BAD.  I laughed once. Chuckled under my breath a couple times. The rest of the time I just sat there thinking: "Why is this so horrible?"  The MCU is becoming unwatchable.  You could argue that their time has passed and people are just ready to move on. You could say that they are running out of good stories, having used up most of the great Stories from the Comics. You could argue a lot of things, but the fact is, it has been a combination of things that are taking the MCU down.  I won't get into all of the Politicized issues that get forced down pur throats in these movies nowadays, but believe me, that's part of it. I don't care if people want to admit or acknowledge that fact or not.  So far, Phase 4 of the MCU has been a failure, and if this continues, Marvel/Disney will be forced into a tough decision...
"I didn't really love this movie. I enjoyed aspects of it. . . . It's no Ragnarok."  That sums up my thoughts on the movie very well.
meh. i'll pass
I meeded more god-butchering if a character is being called “The God Butcher”.  Disappointed.
I’m so surprised - I really loved it personally and had a blast watching it - I liked it a lot more than Multiverse of Madness
I had fun.... but is was a non consequntial movie... doesn't lead the overall forward.... it doesn't need to, but is weird for marvel
This movie was shit!! Not enough Gorr butchering and no balance with comedy. Movie felt more like a parody and so much more issues. My least favorite MCU movie. And yes, I enjoyed Dark World over this movie. Yup, I said that!!
starts at 3 min in
it was tosh. Thor does panto
I am not convinced, at all, about Taika (Ragnarok notwithstanding).  I’ve seen him interviewed a couple of times and the guy has this creepy Jeff Goldblum weirdness to him.
This channel used to be about something and I enjoyed coming here for Chris' funny takes on bad films; particularly his hilarioty series. Nowadays every video he's putting out either makes reference to his film project or he's trying to stroke the erm..."egos" of his fellow filmmakers and production crew by not saying anything negative about their films. Dude are you forgetting that it is the same people that you are abandoning now are the ones who helped you get where you are? Youtube subscribers put you on the map and many of them chipped in and generously donated the obscene amout of money that you are now using to pursue your personal dreams. You've basically been living on somebody else's buck for the past 5 years so the least you can do is give back every once in a while. If you can no longer review a bad movie and give your honest opinion, then change the name of your channel to "Filmmakers Brotherhood Wankfest" or some shit like that, so your loyal subscribers can start making their way to the exit!
I loved it especially compared Shang chi & eternals 🤢
I felt this film probably had 50% of the shots cut.  The pacing and jump editing just felt dislocated.  Hope TW delivers a director's cut that's 3.5 hours long.
This movie had a great adult theme, it lost focus when it had to accommodate the Disney's side of it. I knew the moment I noticed Gold blood that this is the only blood we will see & we won't see intended Gore. From Gorr coz of kids
God this movie was ass
I don't know.  I think Taika Waititi has had a couple hits, but most of his movies were dogs.  I think the problems crop up when he tries to put in comedy.  It seems like he does OK with a serious script, but to me his comedic sense is just too sophomoric.  If you saw Taika Waititi actually playing a role in Free Guy you'll know what I mean.  It was absolutely painful to watch - like the worst kind of Saturday morning cartoons.  I felt like these recent movies by Taika, and from Marvel Studios in general, were meant to appeal to pre-teens.  If that's what phase 4 is about, to alienate the wider audience, then I feel like they're succeeding.    Maybe we just need to get away from the comic books for a while and come up with another good drama.
I dont really get all the dislike Love and Thunder or even MCU Phase 4 have gotten. If we look back, Phase 1 was just as bad because they didnt start building towards a big event until Phase 2. They were building the Avengers in Phase 1. Iron Man was excellent, but all the other movies up until The Avengers was kinda garbage. Even into Phase 2, the initial movies were bad except for Cap 2.   I just think that Chadwick's death fucked up the original plan Feige was working on. Now they are trying to decide on how to build up to Secret Invasion, Secret Wars, or stories like that. They also have to deal with some of the actors burning out before another 10-15 year build up. I think they are just keeping it light until they figure out some details, personally.
Dumbest movie from the MCU
It really felt like there was little to no love put into this movie. Tessa and Taika publicly insulting the VFX while artists are starting to come out about how Marvel treats them poorly is awful.  Taika’s redditor-type humor is also starting to get annoying
Thor is the name of a person. God of thunder is the tittle
It was certainly difficult to make this movie, considering the fact the director had actors disregard the screenplay every day. I support You, Chris - keep up building Your dream. But, this review makes no sense in light of Your previous genuine review style.
Thor now is a clown. An unfunny one.
Thor was just emasculated for "wahmen power" it was a pathetic gender political ad. Taking a male lead established franchise & jamming political garbage down our throats. Shame as Thor was the best in the MCU, now we're going to get a female Avengers movie. With Depp rejecting Disney they really don't care that they are bleeding money lol
It's crap, and people should be warned off before they waste their time and money.
Bro going see top gun 3 times this month. Ok bro we get it you a fan
No way home I thought was messy and all over the place
I also felt like it was rushed and there was so much missing):
I don’t agree with not reviewing movies you didn’t like. I feel you should share your opinion and you also add positives, even when it’s a crap movie
I liked JoJo Rabbit and Ragnarok but L+T looks a bit generic blah...
So, where is the review?
Waiki Tatiti
Great filmmaker? Lol did he just say that? For real? Seriously? Wow bro not sure what to say to that. Fucking LMFAO
Wow. I had no idea this movie was doing The God Butcher storyline. That's disconcerting. That was a great story.
Thor demonstrates femininity in this film and the “comedy” is forced. This movie was not necessary. They should’ve came out with Guardian  and gave Thor his moment in it and called it a day. Disney keeps pushing this gay/ woke Agenda they won’t have me as a marvel fan much longer. I’m waiting for Guardian , if they is too woke and suck just as bad, I’m done.
I really ilke the idea of Zeus and Hercules as villains! I cant wait for it!
Every body who sees this comment must say his height
This movie sucked
Give Valkyrie a Queen you cowards.
Horrible movie.
I finally watched it, and I must say it was way to gay for no reason.
I really wish we got to see the God Butcher butchering the Gods.
just saw it and it was so cringe.
I feel like Chris is trying to not step in the many potholes on the road to the review of Thor LoNT.
Disappointing film. I don't see how this movie was intended for kids, too many uses of inappropriate language, innuendos that don't work and felt quite vulgar.  Use the lore and history of this franchise to elevate the film. Instead it was 2 hrs of no world building and totally disregards any of the previous films. We want to see more of the badass infinity war Thor, not this hippy middle age one who constantly acts like a child and doesn't know what to do with himself.   The only decent part of this film was Natalie Portman being back, which would of made more of an impact had they kept it secret. Her best scenes are already in the trailers.  Gorr was a bore. Such a forgetful enemy. Bales acting and appearance was top notch, but just didnt really care about his character and didn't explain any of his abilities, just a conveniently placed sword, that conveniently came to his hand and now he's the God butcher. Pathetic writing.   Thanks Taika for Ragnarok, I personally didn't like it, but the character needed to be revitalised in some way. But you need to step up your game. If you're going to spend 2 hrs creating a giggle fest, then start creating your own original project's and leave the franchise for those who care about the characters.  Don't waste your money on this film. You're really not missing out  on anything meaningful.
For me this very almost the worst of the four Thor films
This movie is a parody of itself Not at all a fan of Korg or Taika Waititi
Top gun for a 3rd time lol
Thor was hot garbage🤔
My guess is that the movies are targeting a different audience now. It’s all about the younger superheroes, visuals, shorter showtimes, and entertainment. It’s not about story telling as much as about getting kids hooked for the new set of releases.
Good lord. This movie was absolutely awful! Waititi shouldn’t write for this franchise again.
he stop talking smack about movies because hes to famous now and the movie makers would come for him if he sh*t on they movie.
this movie felt like a lame sitcom with the laugh reels missing. i can count on one hand the jokes that actually landed with anyone in the theater.
This movie flopped.
Thor love and thunder is disappointing. Thor should be wearing a clown suit as the movie is comical and borders stupidity.
not a fan of horror movies but still congrats to you on Shelby Oaks. Keep going, bro. You're gonna make it. Shit, you already did. Top Gun: Maverick was cool too. Peace, man
When I see a video with this amount of dislikes thats using coming sense. *I immediately like*
Really enjoy your reviews. Apart from the sign off...As a fan of yours I think I'd prefer something other than "...and get Stuckmann-ised". Maybe...I love talking about movies for you guys and if you enjoy hearing the kind of things I say, Stick Wi' Stuckmann. " ...and get Stuckmann-ised"
Original cut for this movie was 4 hours long. Marvel told them to edit it so it will be under 2 hours.
As many have said, the characters are pretty good (the end character is super cute!), but watching the film once is enough for me.
Movie was a solid 10.  Out of 20.
This is such a strange review, mostly about marketing and very few specifics about the actual movie, seems like a you-problem
Seriously why does this Dude have tattoos on skinny ass arms?
Your transcript is wild lol
The MCU hasn't done Thor justice since Infinity War.  I thought "fat Thor" was his low point until I watched Thor:  Love and Thunder.  It was by far the worst movie in the MCU.  There were so many scenes that were cringe worthy.  The wokeness didn't help.
The God butcherer. And they show him kill 1 God. Thor literally killed the same amount in the movie.
A reviewer who doesn't make reviews for movies he doesn't like?
new marvel is trash
I'd change the end . Instead of dying gorr would win and get his daughter brought back . But seeing what her father became she chooses Thor . Enraged and twisted by the necrosword he tries to kill thor . But thor using the bifrost banishes him and breaks the sword . However in a post credit It shows a desolate plant and gorr kneeling at a throne . He wishes to kill thor and claim his daughter back . Another waves his hand and a black substance forms around gorrs hand . It becomes a more comic accurate all black . Gorr swears to kill thor and serve his new master . The camera shows knull . King of symbiotes
I though the movie was a spoof.
Remember, Disney has a play in this as well.
Nice shirt
Goodness... 1/5th of the video is sponsored messaging. Otherwise, good feedback on the movie. I also would have liked to see more of Christian Bale.
what kind of Review is this? this is not you, its like your afraid to say something,
Honestly?  I think the directors and actors were just pissed off at Feige and Disney.    (It seems) they are super meddlesome when it comes to inclusion of divisive social agendas (often at the expense of the story and character development) and they also say “full stop at 2 hours”.  Taika said it was 4 hours long.  I’d sit through a 4 hour movie if they had an intermission because I know this guy and these actors know what they are doing.  It just all seems like a waste and what you are seeing are a bunch of talented people saying “ain’t no way we are going down with the ship on this one”.  It sounds like they are dumping on the VFX people but in reality- they are angry at Feige and Disney for hamstringing their creativity
wow this is so cool and interesting.
The film felt unfocused for me as far as the storytelling and direction aspect is concerned.
There was a close up shot of storm breaker spitting out the bifrost and Thor was close up to it and the visual infidelity was shockingly poor for a Disney film
In my opinion phase 4 should have never happened I think the build-up leading up to Infinity war and end game was really outstanding and really cool and very climactic and to have it continue for the sake of profit sort of cheapens the entire thing and I hate that
Thanks Chris I’ll wait for it on Disney+
the movie was dumb and bad.
Chris, review the elvis movie!
The movie was an acid trip.
lol. why even review soomething if youre too scared to step on toes
This is my favorite Thor movie
Yeah, I gotta say, I agree. I don't love it, don't hate it. It's just kinda there.  Also, does anyone else remember watching that first trailer and wondering "what the heck is this about?" They didn't even mention Gorr until later marketing and in the movie, he's just some dude with shadow monsters, we don't really know anything about him or his kind, the opening was terrible and his ending isn't much better. If he was just getting Stormbreaker to wish his daughter back to life, then why was everyone so intent on stopping him?  Ragnarok had a very clear plot, but this...I dunno, it was all over the place. Marvel seems a bit aimless recently.
Since they started including gay characters their movies have been going downhill
I have yet to see a review that would convince me to watch this piece of shit movie. It's like a five year old wrote the script...
Worst Thor movie. And that speaks VOLUMES since Thor 2 is already one of if not the worst MCU movie
The shit sucked “the all funny Thor” 👎🏽
Intro totally had nothing to do with thor!
It seemed like this..... THEY DID NOT... CARE... they thought hey lets have fun and oh shit now we have to market this? crap
Why even make reviews if you’re afraid to critique a movie? The critical drinker and other reviewers will lapse you in success if you keep down this path. Best of luck on the movie.
Thor 1 and 2 were better than the sequels. Ragnarok was crap this is worse.
If Chris & Taika do make another movie together I feel like they need to make Thor a little bit more mature and a bit less brawn over brains next time round than he was in this movie. I do like the more funnier side of him, don’t get me wrong, but I do feel like they did a slightly better job of it in Ragnarok, Infinity War & Endgame beforehand
Because you are involved in filmaking, doesnt meam you cant speak critically about films. Thats a missed opportunity to hear. I think you bite your tongue on this film. This wasnt a very good film; it was enjoyable but with no meaning, no substsnce. In the end it was a mediocre execution that couldnt escape its boundaries. It was not innovative like Rangarok. I think you should not be afraid to be critical Chris. That is were you started, dont forget it. If you choose to be a filmaker you are double the critic. Just food for thought.
I love the movie
We donʻt support a cult that harms people.
This movie sucked
one of my favourite youtubers is almost at 2 million subscribers
You spoke a lot more about the marketing than your thoughts on the film. Go in more depth about what you think of the movie.  But I was disappointed by it. It was dazzling. But it should have been a lot better.
Thor was better when he wasn’t in on the joke.
When will you talk about ms marvel?
To it seems like Phase 4 has no clear direction so far . It doesn’t seem to be as connected as the previous films . It’s all over the place .
Great video
Now that Chris has 'made it' he's too scared to accurately review garbage movies.
It just seemed like any other marvel movie. Like it was good but basic
Am sorry but this film was dog-shit. It was like watching a film that was directed by a 5year old kid for other 5 years old kids
Agree. I think we needed more Gorr the God Butcher. He was a sick villain  Just imagine him as a Sith or Darth Bane? Ohhh boyyyy
Chris, I feel like your holding back
Your standards are way to low. to each their own, but the Movie as a whole. Sucked.
Nailed this review. Spot on.
Movie was TRASH 🗑
It’s not appropriate to criticize movies? Huh?
I think you are nitpicking, if your main issue with the movie is the marketing/ press/ talk about it, that's a no issue. The movie was fun, the characters were cool, the visuals were amazing, and the humor was on point.  I think it's an awesome complement when you want to watch more of a character/ actor, but that's what tells me they used them perfectly, always leave them wanting more.
Top Gun Maverick is amazing!!!!
That film was killed by too many jokes.
I’m unsubscribing from this YouTube Chanel cause this guy seems to now have a different motive and his “review” feels reserved for the sake of being in the good graces of big movie heads from Hollywood…  meh… guy thinks he’s the next Quentin Tarantino lol
I want to see the uncut version with all the missing scenes (Lena Headey, Peter Dinklage, Jeff Goldblum, etc.)
Love the shirt! Bad movie tho
It was horrible
Worst movie I have ever seen!!!!
You got that right Buddy!
It wasn't really a disaster but it definitely is a letdown because the movie could have been so much better considering the cast and the source materials. The potential was so high but only a measly amount of it was utilised.
About Disney and leashes, I think it's harder to leash Hemsworth, Portman,  and Bale than than the Spiderman cast
This determination for Disney to be constantly putting out content in every franchise (Marvel, Star Wars, etc.) doesn't really give the audience enough time to enjoy media and breathe in between, let alone give studios enough time to produce work they're fully happy with.
I wonder what Taika Waititi is going to do with the live-action Akira, since it seems he can do only one type of movie. I loved Hunt for the Wilderpeople, WWDITS, and Ragnarok, but I am personally starting to get tired of his formula.
I think his review has been quite generous I’ve heard reviews saying this film is absolutely terrible! The jokes are forced and the plot falls flat. Don’t listen to him when he said this film was not bad so many people hating on this film for a reason. Don’t waste your time.
To... many... jokes... The movie is a mess...
This was certainly on the bottom of my list of Marvel movies. Too much comedy. Like you said, it is like the director can't help but tell a joke. And that is all this movie is. Too much for my liking.
*Takes forever to get to the video, what with all the shelby oaks and sponsors etc goes on forever* no offense for the movie tho, all the best wishes for shelby oaks release
Love & Thunder…best THOR movie. 👏⬇
Definitely the worst Thor appearance to date.
8:39 well said... oh and Love and Thunder had too many jokes.
Thor's prosthetic eye 👁  was missing too
Chris obviously subtlety made fun of how the previews said HERstory.  Poor Chris is a coward and held at gun point.    Poor Poor coward.
Seeing Thor's character development from Infiniti War-Endgame to this was a tough watch :(
That intro music sounds like heaven to my ears ♥️
Not great. Missed opportunities.
It's not that there was too much humor, it's just that the jokes fell flat.
People are burnt out from super hero movies. Least generic super hero movies. The usual formula. We need a Hancock 2. Or better yet we need an origin story of a new super hero, but with a twist. He actually is the villian at the end and then we get a Cameo of Hancock at the end. People would lose their shit! Imagine a fight where the protag and his "anatagonist" fight on the moon and we see the big heart. Boom end it with a scene of Will Smith coming back and a whole town is devastated. Bam cut to black. Crowd screams. Roll credits and gimme the money
cringey ass humor in this movie and it was rushed. Gorr could've been used more as well they should've shown content of him actually slaying gods. But hey, he actually won against thor, and thor admitted it.
Are u gonna review stranger things 4?
Nah this movie is horrible.  Taika put his man/child personality into Thor up to 11.  That immediately took me out from enjoying the movie and not at any given moment I took this movie seriously.  3/10 imo.
This movie was like a parody movie . Zeus was a joke then the pop up by the celestial was a jk . Marvel has failed since stand lee pass away r.I.p stand lee
I loved it. Just wish they would stop pushing normalization of sexual deviancy in  Disney movies. Way too much gayness being gratuitously inserted needlessly. There is no need for that. It's offensive an innapropriate to many and will keep a lot of parents from allowing their kids to enjoy this movie.
all the trailers are pretty much the whole movie....with 2% differences
just spit it out . BAD MOVIE
Christain Bale is like a world class musician in a crappy band. He can always shine, no matter how bad the rest of the band sounds
This movie was bad and straigh up garbage. Why are critics afraid of saying it?
I actually liked Love and Thunder better than Ragnarok. The comedy felt a lot better balanced especially since it's villain is not a comedic element. And Thor's humor felt more like Thor than in most of Ragnarok. I get that maybe that's because of his identity crisis in Ragnarok but he kindof annoyed me and he felt more like Star Lord than Thor in Ragnarok
Drinking game! Take a shot every time Chris mentions his movie 😂 it will get you drunk!
It was as if his family directed,  worked special effects,  acted and had his money all tied up in this.   Wouldn't/couldn't say a bad word about anything.   Save the participation trophies for the leftist.
As a fan of the modern Thor runs, I didn’t enjoy the time shift that started in Ragnarok. So seeing how Taika was set to direct Love and Thunder too I knew it was gonna be the same “flavor” as Ragnarok. So my expectations were low to begin with and the movie was still underwhelming.
There's only so much you can do with Thor without The Avengers. He's always shined brighter as an Avengers (even in the comic books) than solo and with Steve and Tony being outta the picture, there really ain't too many places for Thor to go other than find a way to keep it going with the team (if in fact there is still a team at this point). It's really time for them to put more energy towards The FF and X'Men after they get the next Marvel movies & TV shows out of the way.
I'm going into this review having not seen an MCU film since Far From Home. Lets see...
The issue is Marvel is pumping out a lot of projects. And those projects are poor in quality. I have been extremely disappointed in all of phase 4. I hope marvel can recover from this. Because slowly I’m starting to loose my interest in the characters we know and love. I’m optimistic that they can build better material 🙏🏻🙏🏻
We need a petition to get Taika fired from Marvel or he will continue to ruin Marvel projects.
From the comment section I can tell why content creators are scared to make changes with their content because subscribers/followers do not expect change or growth from their favorite content creators. Which is strange. But if he doesn’t want to review movies he doesn’t like anymore, that’s okay? I think that is completely okay especially because all the internet is these days is complaining about shit you don’t like, spending weeks and months complaining about shit you don’t like. To them complain that there’s films that are underrated even though all you wanna talk about is shit you don’t like. Why not support films you do like, garnish more attention to it, continue to appreciate it. That makes for a much more productive conversation. Why does he need to be one of 50 thousand people talking about how bad the movie is? Also, being mindful about the way you speak on things and people because of new changes in your life such as a career change shouldn’t be criticized if it’s done in good spirit. Not all criticism needs to be brutually honest or harsh. Something as simple as “I didn’t enjoy it” is absolutely okay.
Hii will you do a movie review ab Elvis ?
This movies is trash
Compared to Critical Drinker Chris is just not a film critic anymore. Being a film critic would also mean to make critical commentary about what exactly it was you did not like in a movie, not just raving about movies you like. So to me Chris was very watchable before he started to make his own proper movies. Now he needs to adjust to this new role but unfortunatelly thats making him for me not interesting anymore. I saw the thumbnail with Love and Thunder and thought i check out what Chris is about these days. I think the last video i saw from him was over a year or more ago. And yeah, it's gotten actually worse for me as a person who is interested in honest movie reviews.
yet again...a WEAK AZZ villain that the MCU couldn't even live up to the comic origins.
Past two marvel movies have not been very good. I was shocked by how bad into the multiverse was. I know marvel movies aren’t know for there amazing dialogue but this was horrible.
"Not every god has a plan" Translation: "Disney no longer has a plan"
to sum it up in a few words, fun movie but dont go in as a hardcore comic fan.
Feels to me like the mcu team as a whole might be suffering from a degree of burnout.  For over a decade now, they've had thousands of people all over the world producing some of their best work all towards a common objective. That's no small undertaking & what we are seeing now, not just in Love &  Thunder but in the wider mcu is akin to what I imagine a marathon runner must feel the moment they cross the line.
Thor love and thunder and the casts: this is a sketch.  Bale: this is not a sketch.   Throughout the film…  Bale: just another reminder…this is not a sketch.
They skipped over a huge opportunity by not having Gorr show up at Omnipotent City and go on a total slash fest
I knew this movie was going to be bad as soon as they announce Jane Foster was returning as “Thor” But I never would’ve thought they would’ve taken the best Thor comics and turn into Batman and robin
@chris pls review succession….dying to hear ur take on it
Chris, what do you think of the documentary ، what is a woman?
Ok, Thor this Thor that, but WHERE THE F IS NORTHMAN REVIEW!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!
When did Chris stop giving a score at the end of a review?
Imagine the predicament, if the world is blown away by how awesome Shelby Oaks will be, Chris becomes a super famous and busy director, and we lose him forever.
The film would have been a lot better if Jane Foster had some personality or at least chemistry with Thor.  This was the only major character death in the MCU that felt entirely inconsequential.
I sincerely hope the four hour version gets released on Disney+
You shouldn't have to censor your reviews in order to pussyfoot around potential future producers. If a movie is ass then it's ass and this time it's ASSSSSS
Hey Chris, I think there's room for tats on your face
The movie had joke after joke after joke. So much so the movie became one big joke!
I see Marvel are pretty much done making films with care or soul now

This channel has gone so bad 👎.  Afraid to say what you really want because your directing too and don't want any blow back from other directors in the industry.   I used to always look forward to your reviews for some truth and always agreed with your take.   Not anymore
This dude is up his own ass these days
Wait.. so now Chris don't talk about movies he didn't like.. because he makes his own movies and he doesn't want to expose himself to other people that make movies?.. so what's a point of listening to this dude now? XD Bad movie = no review or even worse bad movie will get sugarcoated by him. As for Thor. I am not afraid to say that this movie is terrible.
I didn't like Ragnarok so I just know this isn't the film for me.
Christian Bale still gave an incredible performance in Thor love and thunder as the villain Gorr the god butcher! Too bad many of his scenes got cut in the end because it's a disney child-movie! He got too little screen time!
Those goat screams made me want to smash my balls with Mjolnir, become a god and stab myself with the Necro Sword.
This phase is a complete cluster
Dude. Cut the shit. You're a movie reviewer on YouTube. We all come here for that. Guys like you who become thespians of theater or follow-your-dream directors...nobody cares. for the few of you who do ...Otay
I'm sick of this constant reboot of the Thor character. He's never consistent from one movie to another. Now he's a dumb and clumsy clown... I love Taika's humour in Ragnarok but half of the jokes here (and i'm really generous) is just inappropriate.
This movie was just meh . I liked bale but that’s were my enjoyment stopped. Thompson they had her doing nothing in movie . Most comedy was over kill and missed its mark . Portman was ok . The 2 goats were dumb . It just didn’t feel like a Thor movie at all more like a long thor skit commercial
Not as good as Ragnarok but still good.
I sure miss the days when it didn't seem like Chris had been bough off by the access media. You can't rely on an honest review here anymore. Another one bites the dust. Chris is about a year away from doing collabs with Grace Randolph. 🤣
I fell asleep in the theater
Marvel's phase 2 has been absolute garbage, if they keep going like this, they'll become like the Transformers franchise.
What? Your not going to review movies you don’t like anymore? Don’t be part of the problem please
Chris please review RRR
Great shirt!
Spider-Man: No Way Home was just ok. Then I wasn't impressed with Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. Thor: Love and Thunder will probably be my last Marvel movie. Phase Four just seems to progressively turn out movies that lack quality. They are beautiful but that doesn't make up for storylines that are just ok.

What’s the point of this channel now?? You don’t even give honest reviews anymore.   This isn’t even a review of the film, it’s a review of people in the industry and how hard they work and how nice they were to you and  “ohhh I’m making a movie called Shelby oaks so people be nice to me.”   You hold yourself back from saying what you want because you want to make sure when your movie comes out people don’t automatically go out to criticize it. It’s not genuine.  Only talking about films you like isn’t being a film critic or a reviewer, it’s just you being one big commercial. Clearly you made this “review” to keep the sponsorships rolling which is understandable but bro you didn’t even enjoy making this cause you were trying to not come off like a harsh critic and it shows. 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
RRR Movie Review Bro Availabile In Netflix 💯🔥
I loved it, it felt different and unique, in a fase 4 where every movie and tv show feels kinda samey, yeah I mean it felt a bit rushed maybe, and it sometimes struggled to find it's tone but I had a blast watching, and that's what I want out of a marvel movie, fun, it was reeeaaaallllyyy fun. Also it's style and cinematography felt very rich and confident, I loved the black and white segment for example. I don't know, it felt very different and risky, was it Intentional? I don't know, and neither do I really care about that, the point is that I had a blast and it a lot more personality than the rest of the phase 4 movies so far.
Displate? What about datplate? 😁😉
The MCU was done after End Game as far as I'm concerned. Nothing but garbage since. Spider-Man doesn't count in my book since he's really a Sony property.
Why would you call it a review when there is no review, you like it but it has flaws.  Not as good as ragnarok I'm not upstanding your channel anymore, Either your going to give an honest review of a product or not and give it a rating 1-5.  I'm not sure why people just dont want to be honest anymore and this will be the last time I watch review from stuckman or a review that isnt a review.
His relationship with Stormbreaker was funny at first but then got really.... really uncomfortably awkward toward the end. Like... wtf is he doing to that thing when no one's watching??
What got me disappointed the most is how misleading the trailer is
After hearing how the extra material was cut due to those scenes going off script for unnecessary comedic purposes, it feels like there wasn't a lot of care taken for the film
Hey, someone, anyone - How did Thor get to the Eternity Gate? Maybe I micro-napped or was shoving some popcorn in my face, but Thor was on earth, in the hospital talking to Jane, then Valkyrie, then it cuts to the Eternity gate and Gorr is using Stormbreaker to open the gate, a giant stone head falls on the kids and Thor catches it.....HOW DID HE GET THERE?
Exactly what you said and here is an example:  In the trailer, Valkyrie licks a knife and yet in the movie it never happened.  That's false advertising if you will.
Like many of the comments here I didn't hate it, it wasn't terrible. I just find with phase 4 of the MCU. I don't care. I'm indifferent, that might be worse. I still watch them as they come out and I still enjoy certain things. But the MCU hype ended for me with Endgame.
Shill
Please Review The Italian Recipe (2022). It's available on my channel!
The best Thor for me was still the first Thor. I did not like Ragnarok at all. I like Love and Thunder better than it. Dark World is still the worst one though. The first one is very underrated and despite the Dutch angles, I loved the film. This one, it’s good. That’s all      Also for Phase 4 for me has both the best and worst MCU films. Best being No Way Home and worst being Eternals.
I’ll translate Chris’s video for you guys since he’s unable to say what he’s really thinking: There’s too many jokes in the movie, most are bad. Christian Bales characters should of been given way more time developing. The movie should of picked a tone and Ran with it. I met Taika, he’s a cool guy, but I don’t know what this crap was. Ragnarok was a better movie. -Chris stuckman 2022
The movie looks bad and it seems like you're dancing around that fact
I believe Jeremy Jahns put it best. It's just dumb fun, and poor story telling.
This guy still thinks he's going to be a filmmaker. Youtuber, wake up, enjoy the fact you got away with this youtube thing, dont be delusional.
This is the nicest review I've seen of this movie.  But its extremely telling that this reviewer says he is not going to go see it again.  I think its a sign of good movie is how rewatchable it is.  There are some movies I looked forward to but I came away meh or it was okay but I will never watch again which is sad.
Just watched it... Complete shit... And for a group of people who are completely against stereotypes... Guess what a load of them... Russell Crowe just looked awful... As zeus... I can't believe some people came out the cinema saying it was the funniest film ever.... I would never have waititi Direct another film again... Of course this is Disney... And they are more interested in quotas rather than making a good film... And why the f***.. Did Chris Hemsworth look like a f****** Power Ranger🤬🤬🤬🤬
guess that explains the decrease in movie review uploads.. Too bad you're no longer as honest as you were with them..
This movie definitely needed more “gore”, I mean Gorr.
Chris should go back to what he used to do. I wish he wasn't afraid to make reviews of bad movies anymore because that's what I loved about him. Something has changed in him since he got into the Hollywood business and I feel like it's tainting the quality of his movie reviews. It's disappointing because he used to be so great.
New introduction is gay bro
I feel that since Chris wants to "make it" as a film director he can't give negative reviews so as not to bother his "fellow" directors. This has been the most forward opinion since a long time. I can't see how one thing cancels the other but go figure, he wants in.
I'm sorry but I strongly disagree about Thor Ragnarok being a good movie. To each his own I guess.
Actual review starts at 8:52
This movie is complete woke garbage. Don't waste you're time with Thor & Thor. Everything woke turns to 💩. Go watch Top Gun instead..its amazing.
It's really amazing that you're moving to bigger things, Chris. I'm proud of you. But in case you have forgotten, a couple of years ago, you did a Hilariocity review and you referenced Jet Li's The One. You said that one day, you will do a Hilariocity review of that movie. What do you say, pal? One last time? 😊 It's absolutely cool if you don't want to. I'm just saying. By all means, I am a huge fan of Marvel. I personally agree with you. Love and Thunder could've been better. Ragnarok is still the best Thor movie. To be honest, I'm not a fan of horror movies but still congrats to you on Shelby Oaks. Keep going, bro. You're gonna make it. Shit, you already did. Top Gun: Maverick was cool too. Peace, man ❤
For me the creepiness of Gorr and the rest of the movie being basically stand up comedians exchanging jokes between each other didn't really glue together. I don't think Natalie Portman is a comedy star, I didn't like how goofy and silly her character was written in this movie
This is my all-time worst movie ever. It's supposed to be an action adventure not a comedy. it was way to slap stick. I walked out after the first half hour.
This was the best reaction that I can relate to. You essentially captured the exact ways that I felt when I left the movie. Good stuff man this is the first video I’ve seen of ya so I’ll subscribe and keep up!
Hi Chris, love your videos and looking forward to Shelby Oaks. Would you please review The Northman?
Chris, you should go see "Brian and Charles". It's got to be one of the great budget sci-fi comedies of the year. I loved this film. please do a review of it? regards Rob.
abysmally bad movie. as bad as matrix resurrections. tonally all over the place and unusually for a marvel movie not particularly funny
No critic on ELVIS yet? Which means you didn't like it?
Shang chi and no way home were both shit. I paid for both and really regret it.
I had a feeling that they knew that their movie was going to be in third place compared to the other two and settled in. But to be fair, we cant keep going bigger and badder with every movie villian. There has to be low level villians where its one on one. Cause if Gorr went up against the entire avenger team, the movie would be over in one sequence.
I wish for one video without Shelby oaks. I still don't care about production of movies, I'm here for reviews. (That being said Im happy if you do something you like, whatever it may be: gardening, figure skating, making movies)
Love and thunder is a good movie, in my opinion. I know the movie lack in a few places but I feel like people forgot the main purpose of the movie. Thor trying to find inner peace. It’s explained in the trailer, literally in the trailer. I feel like some people are focusing too much if the jokes are funny or not.
i dislike it more knowing it could have been one of if not the best marvel movie
Lmao the face
I did feel that they cut Bale's parts too much.
The movie gives second hand embarrasment constantly. However, every time Christian Bale makes an appearance, the movie quality goes up ten fold. They could have just cut the entire film leaving only his clips and it would be an amazing movie.
Your reviews have become so boring since you started directing your own film. So stretched out, not much said, very careful with your words instead of being honest. Honest content is the biggest draw of youtube. Playing politics now that you are sort of in the industry? That's fine, Ill be unsubbing now. Worthless dull content yikes.
I personally love your reviews but why fccus on interviews and comments on the movie from the director, etc.  Who cares? For sure, a lot of flaws.  I agree.  But I think a lot of you Youtube critics are focusing on things that are so trivial  to the average viewer. I sometimes feel like you guys are just nitpicking at nonsense.  For sure Thor has issue - but I didn’t really care in the end.
It was such a mehh movie
Chris that’s kind of some pussy shit to say you’re not gonna give an opinion on a bad movie because you’re trying to make movies, just cuz you held your tongue does not mean others will praise you for your attempts. If anything making a movie should make you more open to criticism both going and coming. Shame.
I don't watch every video chris uploads, but it's rare for him to say that a movie is bad or not recommended.
It's was shit movie
i thought it was stupid how the second trail for love and thunder had jane foster as thor. would have been nice to see that in theater
This was a terrible movie.
Disney yet again, delivers another "UPPER DECKER".
Disney Marvel/Star Wars villains are impotent and I have no fear of them.
When did superhero movies turn into slapstick comedy?
I respect what your doing but i think u should go back to what got u to the dance and thats being a movie critic. This is why I personally started listening to u and what i still identify u as. Its noble that your trying to be positive but pressure makes diamonds and we need your critical mind. I want to hear your honest thoughts. I dont want u to be too nice. True talent needs obstacles. I feel like u can be a critic without being an asshole. Let the truth free
unsub
Definitely more of a comedy than action comedy like Thor Ragnarok. Still entertaining movie 🍿
Rrr review
Saw this movie twice. The first time was with my wife and I, and the second was because a friend invited. I thought it was ok and very flawed the first time, and it definitely felt mucked around with. Interesting enough, I actually liked it more the second time. Not sure if it was because my expectations were set, or if it was because there were a lot of story details I noticed the second time around.
They are 100% releasing an editors cut extended addition, bet that was the plan all along , same audience twice
Hey Chris! When are you gonna review Jurassic World Dominion?
Those disc plates  are cool
it's F- trash.   Marvel's worst film yet.
Like for Chris Hemsworth, nothing else  just hit it
With Marvel movies and stories, we need 95% serious-Hero-story-telling-and-action, and then 5% Humor.   Taika Waititi has skewed the ratio to 60/40   and it doesn't feel right... it's off putting.  I hope he doesn't do that to Star Wars.
Chris, I love you man, been a fan of you for like 6 years now, but it was a bad move making your reviews watered down, I know you said you don't wanna disrespect the work of other movie directors or something to that effect, but in doing this you make it less honest, and not being 100% honest is gonna drive people away, regardless if you're just trying to be nice. I still like your channel and reviews, but I liked you waaaay more when your reviews were unfiltered, where you said whatever you felt.
Comedy Thor is going to get old quick.
They love punching down...
I don't know what it was but I felt like I was starting to fall asleep during the final fight scene.
I liked the video just because of the Zelda t-shirt
This movie was a mess.
Bro reviews movie from Malaysia title: “Mat Kilau”
I think the problem with this Thor is that the Villain took a back seat to the Love story/ Jane's cancer fight etc.  That was their gamble and although I did not hate this movie I think  they could have done more with Gor and less jane.  but that is my personal opinion I enjoy a good antagonist that is really showcased they gave little time to Gor
I was actually shocked at how bad this movie was, and I love Thor. The acting, pacing, story, kids at the end bad acting (again)...it seemed like a high school project from 15  year olds. So disappointed.
@ Time Stamp 7:11 - Marvel hasn't cared about the source material since I taken over by Disney. Stay true to the source material. This is nothing like the Gorr the God Butcher story.  Creating your own vision of a superhero is fine. But make it original. Don't corrupt someone else's work of art to give it your own personal twist. If you do, it shows you have no imagination and don't respect the work someone else do d that was original.  Thor peaked between Ragnarok and Infinity War. After that, instead of showing how Thor deals with defeat to return to become stronger is much different than making him fat, depressed w anxiety attacks, impotent and a bumbling fool.
Taika Waititi dumping on the effects is an admission that perhaps he wasn't fully committed to making this work.  He's the Director. He oversees all of it. For him to criticize the effects is like a Lieutenant dumping on the privates for his own crappy leadership.  He's not fully committed to the character. Where in Thor's books does he have a midlife crisis, or is overweight?  He's not.  Its simply Waititi taking something... turning it into something that even he didn't like, and then realizing it... and trying to push the responsibility onto others for his bad job.  He should have called it quits and moved on to other projects after Ragnarok.
We need a review of Stranger things season 4!
It seems like you’re really pulling punches. It’s okay to criticize art. It doesn’t mean you’re being rude or out to hurt people. Just say what you think about it and if you are worried about people criticizing your work, that’s perfectly normal but will be necessary to get better and grow.
The movie had some epic scene!! It had some terrible scene!! As a whole, it's not good.
I can’t believe you’re holding back on your review bro just because you’re a Director doesn’t mean you should hold back saying something true
i don't think you realize how pompous and annoying you can come off... you're not a legit director.. you have no actual QUALITY credits.. you're not even a real movie reviewer.. you're just a guy on youtube.. you guys are all a dime a dozen.. outisde of youtube your opinions don't matter at all..
ITS FKN WOKE!!!!! WOOOOOOOKE!!!!  LEAVE MARVEL ALONE YA WOKE TURDS!!!
Waititi is godawful
I've heard rumblings that the vfx workers at the mcu are really upset about long hourd, pay, impossible deadlines...its going to be interesting seeing how it starts to unfold in the real workd
Its funny how Chris started as my favorite film critic, for balanced and calm reviews. I didnt like Jeremy Jahns very much coz of all the over the top energy and body language. Now days Chris is almost asleep in his videos and he never gives "bad" reviews while Jeremy is a lot more palatable, calmer but still plenty of expression and honest views. Jeremy it is I guess....
My guess is that the MCU is trying to break the overbearing expectations for a meta "payoff", in order for a title to stand on it's own. If Love and Thunder seems more like a Waititi movie than an "MCU movie", then I think that's what they're going for.
Was this a review for the movie or for the marketing of the movie?
I dream of a day marvel movies are no more.
Please don't fck up blade with all this comedian sht
I just don’t get why Marvel films have to be funny. Growing up, the comics weren’t  funny, they were serious, even up till the late 90s. I can see a little “wink, wink” once in awhile but these films have descended into buffoonery.
The film was dog 💩
100% agree. I feel like this was Marvel trying to figure out how to let Natalie Portman’s character die with dignity w/out just writing her out of the MCU completely. There was no structure, humor in the wrong places & not enough use of great acting talent. I hate to blame Taika for this one but when you look at the credits, I think maybe he should have opted for different writers. His original works are goofy w/ elements of other genres & that’s precisely why T:L&T just wasn’t a good MCU film.
Pretty much every MCU movie post-Endgame was garbage. So yeah, I really don't think Feige cares anymore.
You liked Shang-Chi!!!!???? oh dear, I find that perterbing.
Tell me how mid this movie only by changing its title, for example: *Thor 3 1/2: God of Thunder’s New Groove*
Thor lost all seriousness. Everything is a joke and he's literally indestructible. I thought the movie sucked, it's like all Taika in every character.
A horrible film, marvel is so bad these days, for focusing on stupid identity politics and very bad writing, they made the a joke and made the STRONG FEMALE THOR the hero who sacrificed herself 🙄BORING
Maybe the problem is that after End Game the Marvel universe has no real direction. Ragnarok had high stakes, lots of purpose and it led straight into Infinity War.
Nothing wrong with the vFX. This movie was just not good. Gorr is not a character arc that it suited to a PG audience. They kept him so relatable throughout the whole thing that you'd get for a second that he was a God-Butcher. Worst part of it was just the emphasis on comedic tone - One scene just shows this: Thor standing next to Falligar the Behemoth (slain giant god) should've been a shocking solemn moment; that was his friend. Instead we get misplaced jokes at the expense of Sif.  The little time that Christian Bale gets in this movie is honestly the little that saves it from being a complete dumpster fire.   They need to go with a new director for Thor's next outing.
I loathed this movie and am convinced it will age as one of the worst Marvel movies ever. What little atmosphere and mood was created with the introduction of Gorr was immediately destroyed by endless joking and sidetracking. The worst part is that the concept of this movie could have been the basis of an extremely intriguing story, but instead we get a series of scenes that just feel point- and weightless.
Chris your blunt honesty has evaporated since you became a "film maker"
The gay lesbian propaganda was over the top in this film.  It breaks my heart, but I may have to skip the next one.
I think what they're doing with Thor is interesting. No, this movie isn't as strong as many other MCU films, but there's at least a consistent theme going on with Thor lately. That theme, to me, is "What do you do when your life has been completely changed?" and it's something that I feel a whole lot these past several years.   Thor: Ragnarok was an exploration of Thor learning that his family's dark past was more problematic than he comprehended, his decision on whether or not he was going to obsess over that or if he was going to do what he could to help those in need.   Avengers: Infinity War saw Thor having to deal with a threat that was out of his element, while his losses were compounded from the previous movie. We got to see him adapt and plan, while also forging new bonds with the Guardians of the Galaxy.   Avengers: Endgame did something really interesting, not just with his character, but with all the MCU cast. The running theme of that movie seemed to be all about how the characters processed trauma and how they grieved. Some of them responded by trying to help others as much as possible, as Captain America did, and others were just so overcome with their sense of failure and loss. Thor was one of the latter, as shown with his weight gain and unhealthy behavior, along with an implication that he'd become an alcoholic.   This movie is continuing where Endgame left off with his character, that being that he's working to overcome his negative behaviors and grow from the trauma he's suffered. However, it's not just like flipping a switch. We learn that he doesn't have a great history with processing loss even before the Snap, and that cost him his relationship with Jane. He's still kind of adrift, and it takes another crisis to get him to focus and actually process his emotions.
Love and Thunder was awful, by far the worst Thor movie. Marvel is a sh*t show! Dr Strange sucked too. Kevin Feige’s political agenda has comprised his ability to produce good movies like he used to.
Thor is the god of thunder one of the most powerful beings in the universe yet we constantly get a watered down version of Thor . Why is thor being marketed as a comedian I'm really disappointed in this I cant even finish the movie doesn't feel like a thor but a parody sad a god reduced to jokes
Hahaha you can't go a upload without mentioning your making a "movie", dude u sold out
So much yea for the t-shirt!
Do Father Stu
Its a hard pass from me, I want a Thor movie, not a Thor parody where he's the butt of every stupid joke.
I didn't really find it as funny as Ragnarok, which makes it feel like they're trying too hard to replicate what Ragnarok has done. Jokes were often a miss for me.   The pacing was also wonky. When there's action, it's good, but when there's none I don't feel like I like what I'm watching. Also, the final fight? I hate that they had to retreat and go to a hospital  for a minute, then go straight to fight again. I find it out of place.   Tone was also off. Does it want to be funny? Does it want to tell a love story? If it does, then why rush the love story flash back? Does it want to be serious? Cos I don't really feel there's enough stakes here.   Lastly, they wasted Jane's return and Gorr/Christian bale. They didn't even show the first time Jane transforms, or flesh out the reason more how she is worthy. And Gorr. He looked scary in trailers, felt a bit of empathy thru his back story but how am I supposed to feel scared of a God killer when I only ever saw him kill once? Dude should've been the one to kill Zeus, or at least attempt to wreak havoc in god city.
Mighty Thor would've been a spoiler, but they pretty much announced that first.
Great Movie
Nowadays, Marvel shits and we all just go to cinemas and pick it up.
Dude, do your reviews like a critic, and not as a film maker. Huge difference in your reviews. This movie was crap. Plot, writing, characters, everything.
It tells you everything you need to know, if Chris talks about the marketing , the last Thor movie and the directors character most of the time... and not about the actual movie.
Chris I’ve been a sub for over a decade and I love your reviews. But I don’t see any reason to watch anymore of you’re going to dance around how you really feel.  Just say the movie was trash if its trash.  Instead you talk about the marketing and say “structural issues”. C’mon man.
Not so good. Unfortunately
This movie was a 2 hour pull my finger joke
Nothing is good in this movie. Bale is wasted. You’ve become a shill. Zeus was a horrible joke. Thor is now an idiot.
If you dont like a movie you wont review it because it may be unprofessional? Thats the most unprofessional thing I've heard.
I feel like there's something holding you back.
You soft
Sweet shirt.. Ragnarok was HORRIBLE and destroyed the thor character.. Not surprised this movie was shit and not even interested in seeing it..
If the spec effects are bad then there is nothing wrong with saying they are bad. People being overworked is neither here nor there.
Anyone else get star wars prequel vibes when they went to the God city? Im like Portman just cant get away from this crap. This movie was kinda boring compared to Ragnarok. It needed more of that odd/dry humor that Ragnarok had.
That movie sucked. What a huge disappointment. Thor becomes stupid and is not funny at all.
Have you gotten around to seeing the northman yet?
As much as I hate this movie I might buy the blu ray just to see the deleted scenes
You could’ve gotten any displayed but why get a Thor love and thunder one
Still waiting for RRR review 🙌
This movies writing was honestly bad. It was somewhat funny and not that good of fighting scenes. Gorr stole the show in my opinion. And the movie was WAY to gay like literally….and Disney trying to force all that on us it’s just dumb for the movie and dumb for the writing and it’s not necessary. I know people will argue against it but I don’t care. One of the worst marvel movies.

Dude, what do you mean you aren’t going to review or make videos on movies you didn’t like….??? I mean I get what you’re talking about making your own movie, but I’m just gonna be real you with you because I’ve been watching you for a long time; I don’t think think that makes any sense honestly. We all are here to hear your movie reviews and funny thoughts and updates on your own movie. Not to be harsh, but if you’re going to keep doing movie reviews and not include the ones you don’t like, then what’s even the point of doing movie reviews. Because in order to have something that’s good, there has to be something bad to contrast it. I guess I just don’t understand going that direction with your artistic choice for your channel. I will however keep supporting you bro because I really do enjoy what you do. I’m just disappointed you feel as though you have censor your content for whatever reason.
I thought it balanced silly & serious, & one character's storyline hit REALLY close to home, I enjoyed it overall.
It's like a Roger Moore Bond movie that makes fun of Bond movies. It was not a great movie in about five ways.
Where’s the grading ?? What minute mark don’t want to see the whole video
There is no one on this planet who has been more passionate about the Marvel Cinematic Universe than me. I have seen  the 1st Thor movie, Thor: The Dark World,  and Thor Ragnarok  multiple times.  I will never watch Thor love and thunder ever again. I have seen the 1st doctor strange movie probably 6 times.. I will never watch Doctor Strange & The Multiverse Of Madness ever again.  I hope  that James Gunn has not fucked his own Guardians of the Galaxy Galaxy, Volume 3.
Hard pass on this dumpster fire of a movie. Don’t need to see Thor regress and be made into an idiot.
I didn’t even see this movie but I already think that ragnorak was such a good movie . I just thought this Thor was too soon .
You keep it real
Just the review I was waiting on
Kevin did say the marketing for these phases 4 movies were gonna be different then what they use to do.
First time watcher and I must say this video just seem to dance around the idea that you didn't like the movie. Hard to believe that this style got you 2 Million Subscribers. I don't care if a movie is visually stunning, the New star wars movies where visually stunning and they sucked. I'm  Looking for honest movie reviews so I can make an informed decision if I should see the movie. Not a lukewarm review that seems more indecisive than Thor lol
Marvel appears to be in the “cash cow” phase.
I was watching this movie and it made me think that this movie was bad but it wasn't the cast or writers or even directors fault but marvel making Taika cut out all the absolutely amazing stuff they probably made and I feel like that's true because marvel is really destroying itself by them actually keeping very tough constraints on it you know? It makes me mad as someone who personally knows ppl that work for marvel and they haven't told me anything happening soon in the mcu but they told me that it's hell working there right now
I enjoyed the movie, but I feel like if I never saw it then I wouldn't be missing out on anything major that happened to the character or anything that advanced the current MCU phase towards the next Avengers.
I thought that Thor was OK, enjoyable but could have been way better. It sucks cuz I guarantee there's a better movie there that we didn't get to see. If they didn't cut so many Gore the god butcher scenes and made it about two and a half hours long it could have been Great
i make flims are a small budget but if my flims suck its ok to say it sucks. how can any one get better...... if someone told me my flim was an F ill try to make it an A plus just my option.
I feel the same way. I didn't love the movie, it just didn't compare to Ragnarok to me. Not that it was terrible it just felt cheesy to me
The movie sucked
2:35 does that mean no more Hilariocity reviews?
Cool shirt bruh 😎
Are you planning to review Elvis?
Interesting to hear you say you aren't reviewing movies that you didn't enjoy. One of the things that drew me to your channel (and you're only one of two movie reviewers I watch) is that you can be critical about a movie but still cover what's good about it. For instance, I love really terrible action movies because I walk into them with expectations about the choreography and that's it. It's something that helps me personally enjoy movies, but there are very few types of movies I can do that with. I feel like you get that, and it's rare to find someone that can appreciate something for what it is and what it's trying to be but still be critical of it in that respect. Best of luck with your film and thanks for putting out great content!
The fact you gave Thor Ragnarok a pass and even praised it, despite it being the start of the mcu destroying Thor's character, is what gave the man-child director freedom to ruin him further. Also Chris, just some advice, you are a FILM CRITIC, meaning its okay to be CRITICAL of movies! Or have to fallen so far down the hollywood rabbit hole you are now afraid to say anything incase your movie gets push aside by them (which lets be real here, it Will do, because the only low budget movies getting recognised by them today are woke pieces of trash).  Sell yourself out, whatever, you had a good run, but nothing lasts forever. While the rest of us can recognise how the industries are giving fans the middle finger, maybe your realise it yourself in time too.
What's up with all the gay themes?
This movie is 3rd best in series of 4 Movie
Chris looks a little slimmer than the last video I watched. Looking good.
This movie really needed more development. We never saw Gorr kill or Jane really turn into Mighty Thor. It needed at least 30 minutes. I had a fun time watching it but it felt like something was missing.
So dope!!!  Seeing you actualize your dream is truly magnificent..
I didn’t like the movie. Didn’t hate it, but it could have been so much more. Matter of fact, I think it is so much more. After hearing so many interviews about the film, I feel that even the actors felt it was supposed to be so much more. Then to find out that Disney cut the movie in half. They basically Snydered the film. I hope to see Taika Waititi’s full vision of the film in the future. I was hoping Bale could do more, even if they needed to make a two part film.
It's funny how you mention things Martin Scorsese says when talking about the worst MCU movie ever made LMFAO
When I have no questions after a film that’s how you know it’s bad.
Do Fourth of July the movie
The Gray man review please !
Even more interested in seeing this movie. Great video
CRAP!
Hated this movie .. sucked ass ...
From what I've heard from other reviews (particularly Jeremy Jahns' review), a trend that I've seen that leads to Thor 4 (while still enjoyable)  not clicking with people as much stem from _Thor: Love and Thunder_  having TOO much jokes, to the point where it detracts from the film? That was always a lingering issue I had with _Thor: Ragnarok_ , where I liked the humor but it's excessive focus on the humor clashed with the dramatic tone it was trying to convey the other half of the time. Often times, it felt like you were watching two different movies that were mashed together. You had the gravitas of Odin's death and Hela conquering Asgard be undercut by all the jokes that Thor would make that undercut that gravitas. I think that similar to that, in Thor 4, the issue seems to be rather than Thor simply making jokes, it feels like he becomes the joke? That it feels like people are laughing at him rather than with him? That if Taiki Watiti (an immensely talented director whose usually really great at balancing tones of comedy and drama, as shown in _Jojo Rabbit_ )  was really going to commit to the humorous tone, that they should have the antagonists and stakes match that rather than feel like Thor and the main antagonists are from 2 different movies?   Honestly, I think why I consider Guardians Vol 2 and the Ant-Man films to have the right balance while considering Thor: Ragnarok to be too jokey is because of scale, stakes, and expectations. The Ant-Man films have never had end-of-the-world stakes but instead more personal stakes that affect only a select few people close to the characters. The scale of the stakes in comparison  to the humor in the Ant-Man films felt appropiate. Meanwhile with Guardians Vol 2, while the scale is certainly much bigger, it's crux lied in the very grounded, human-like emotional journey of Peter Quill/Star-Lord. It helps that the GotG films never really took themselves that seriously.    Now contrast that with the latest 2 Thor films, where the scale and expectations are much bigger. The main characters in the Thor films aren't humans or humanoid aliens but gods or at least advanced aliens mistaken for gods. When your antagonists are Hela the Goddess of Death and Gorr the Butcher of Gods, there's a rather high expectation of scale and expectations. The expectations set by Hela and Gorr being such menacing cataclysmic foes that cleave through and threaten the people and civilization of Asgard comes with it a certain expectation of gravitas and seriousness. A civilization-ending threat necessitates some gravitas.  If instead the set expectation was more like Hela or Gorr had killed a group of Asgardian children or a personal friend of Thor's like one of the Warriors Three, and Thor had set out on a quest for revenge, then the constant humor and joking wouldn't clash with the tone nearly as much because the scale and expectations are set more appropiately. There would still be stakes and dramatic moments but the scale and set  expectations of the main antagonists and how much of a threat they menace to be is scaled appropriately to the tone and humor.    It's not like the MCU haven't been able to balance humor with drama, especially when it comes to Thor. If the humor and jokes were used as a defense/coping mechanism to help with fear and trauma, like we see with Thor in _Infinity War_ and _Endgame_ , then it'd be understandable and appropriate in a sense. But when the jokes are made just because and it goes from laughing with Thor making jokes to laughing at Thor as the joke, that's when the clashing of tones is really apparent.    Concurrently, we never really see Gorr actually butcher his way through gods. I feel like that was such a letdown. Gorr is supposed to be a serial killer of _gods_ . I would've liked some more Hannibal Lecter shit, ya know? Have him massacre a few gods and/or show off a wall of grisly trophies like the heads or signature weapons of a few gods from different pantheons. Something to actually show and justify to us why Gorr deserves the title Butcher of Gods.   Instead, Hela (or Thanos) has a better showcase as a Butcher of Gods than Gorr the God-Butcher does.   Do you get what I mean? Does that describe the sort of disconnect that some people justifiably  feel with Thor 4?
Purchased 2 of the Displates which are titled Justice Duo and Victorious. Chris, you are totally on point with Thor Love and Thunder. It was Definitely No Ragnarock!!! Yes, Top Gun Maverick is 100%. Seen it 3x as well 😎👍
If the movie was trash then  say it Chris. If Taika dropped the ball then he dropped the ball. Sad Thor was one of the characters I was really looking forward to seeing how his character will grow. Phase 4 seems very..................safe, dull, and unispired. This is sadly the last Marvel movie I'll watch :-(. Tired os seeing good stories like SPIRIT.
All I remember is screaming fking jokes.. That sht was funny for the first 3 seconds after that I wanted to kick someone..
The movie is horrible. They could have made money hand over fist by following the Gorr storyline from the comics. Additionally it would have been a great way to introduce the other God Pantheons.
Can you review Ed Wood
These don't seem like real reviews anymore. It's like he's afraid to be critical of people's movies due to the fear of looking bad to the directors or missing out on opportunities. I miss when he was critical he gave praise when needed but also talked about the flaws. Now he doesn't even review movie's he doesn't like. Chris your telling me you haven't seen a movie and walked out disappointed? COME ON!
Nice vid!
Thor Love N Thunder sucked . Worst marvel movie. Best thing about it was da GOATS
Shangchi was so crap. I don't understand the love for it.
Yawwn. Boring movie
After all these years, I still love seeing Thor! His story gets better and makes complete MCU sense.
Everything about marvel is effects... it's not story telling or dialogue.
Maybe they just wanna hype people up for the director's cut.
I worked on the set of Love and Thunder in Sydney. Taika Waititi was so unprofessional. He paid a guy to laugh at all his jokes on set. He would arrive late on set at times with his entourage. He was always disorganised with other film departments. He disrespected all of his film crew so it’s no surprise he would be making fun of the work done by VFX artists.
At least it was better than the new Dr Strange
Anything that has gays and is sh*T.....................  you enjoy.    You are just a bad reviewer.
The movie was not serious for the majority. Dialogue was weird. They got way too political with everything. They emasculated Thor. It was clearly about making women look strong and support of the LGBTQ community. If Marvel keeps releasing movies like this, I’m done with them. Christian Bale was the one person who didn’t sell out in this movie. Excellent performance. Great method actor.
Personally, I liked this episode of Thor.
Worse marvel movie .
At least the MCU films are consistent.... they're getting worse...and worse....and worse.....
I suggest you watch RRR, you will regret what crap hollywood you have been watching over the years
This movie was trash
I really hated this movie. Thor was great but the rest of it was pure shit.
I hope Chris does season four of stranger things
I literally wanted to walk out of this movie
My wife didn't like how stupid they made Thor throughout the film. Basically no seriousness to him. They went overboard.
did chris just sell out?
The MCU is becoming 2003 Daredevil.
I was disappointed in this movie. I felt like they stripped away all masculinity from this - actual - God in the interest of corny jokes and a woke agenda.
"I don't make videos of movies I didn't like anymore" There goes Jurassic World: Dominion 😂
I liked "Love & Thunder" more while I was watching it. But upon reflection, it wasn't close to my favorites, but still better than "Multiverse of Madness."
Love your reviews, just curious if you ever plan to review The Northman? I remember in your The Lighthouse review saying you’re a fan of Egger’s work so I was surprised that you hadn’t made a review for it, I thought the movie was fantastic and the best film I’ve seen this year, thanks for all the reviews, love to see your opinions on movies I enjoy and even the ones I didn’t enjoy but to still see it from a different perspective
Was this a review of the movie or the promos?
That movie was terrible. Worst MCU movie ever.
Not trying to be a jerk at all but this the first video I've watched of yours in a very long time, and I was a fan. But, your statement that you don't want to review films you didn't like is exactly why I stopped watching. I can't consider you a film "critic" if you won't give your opinion on what you consider bad movies.
Phase 4 doesnt quite have a main Villain to look for. And there is so much going on, 6 tv series and 5 movies so far and no main villain in the horizon
I miss Chris reviewing serious films as well, instead of only this Hollywood CGI superhero trash.
I thought you only talk about good movies?
Chris STUCK-on-stupid-MAN has completely sold out! Because he was raised in a cult he doesn't recognize danger
Unfortunately this channel completely lost it's essence, you are afraid of being critical of movies which is literally why you gained millions of subscribers. Now you only care about being politically correct. 😔
I went in with very low expectations and was blown away on how bad it was.  Dr Strange just had awful writing and at times, just bad acting.  But this just took it to a whole new level.  And at the end when I saw it was the same director as Ragnarok I couldn't even breath.  :)  How is this possible.  After 45 minutes I was expecting fart jokes to come it was so bad. The kids are just the actors kids?  That explains a lot. I think Robert Downey and Chris Evans lucked out leaving at the high point.
Marvel/Disney has turned into a conveyor belt of content. Pump out mediocrity on a larger scale. It's so sad.
That’s why there isn’t a review of Jurassic world?
3:13
Just saw it 15 minutes ago and im shocked at just how poor it was..what a let down especially after the impressive ragnarorok
2:08 3:13 5:33
Change your titles to movies opinions/ discussions because you don’t review movies anymore your a director now 🙄
Theres rumors that Disney ceo has mandated that the marvel movies be under 2 hours I think this affects the quality of multiverse and love and thunder
I don't like the direction they are going.  It's too much. Movie needs a re-edit with less nonsense and more Gorr doing things.
Skip to 2:20
Agree with everything you said about Thor Live & Thunder but I hated Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings thought it was corny. But Eternals was way worse. Ragnarok was a great fun film I take it you will not be reviewing DC League of Superpets.
The VFX were a tiny letdown, but Taika going FULL Taika Waititi with the jokey-jokes was the real disappointment.
I really dislike the LGBT push into every single Marvel movie or show now … everything is legit a gay push and while it’s fine to be a gay character , I just don’t get why it has to be forced
I really only have 2 critiques about the film. All else is pretty good.   I really enjoyed Ragnarok. Sometimes they pushed the comedy a bit but it was okay because it was actually pretty hilarious. It also didnt set the theme of the movie. Love and Thunder broke right through those boundaries with back to back comedy that not only wasn’t funny but also mocking itself. Basically a parody.  The other ingredient I would reduce or slow down would be Thors sensitive personality. Once again I saw this in Ragnarok but they made it work somehow. In L&T not so much.
It's kinda sad to see how much your reviewing style changed since you started making films yourself! you're so scared to say you dislike something in fear that others would say the same about your work!!
The child soldiers part was really messed up and it shows Gisney doesn't care about kids killing kids every other day in school.
Who else wasn’t expecting a review for this?
I feel like Phase 4 of the MCU is another experimental phase to see what’s worth keeping and what’s worth not using. Just like Phase 1, Kevin had no idea what was gonna work in these movies, so he had to be controlling as fuck and point in a single direction, he experimented; clearly, but it was in the confines of a small box.   Now that the MCU is going into another book or chapter, I think Kevin is more loose and now let’s their creators soar into whatever they need/feel. Obviously they would need to have continuity within the MCU, but every new movie in phase 4 has had plenty of heart and voice out of their directors, showing that Kevin is not afraid to loosen the leash as you said. I’m glad and content with what we have been given, so I do see this as another example of reinventing themselves. Does it work? Sometimes. Should they stop? At some point. Do they needed to do this? Absolutely.   As another great movie said, Marvel is going “Back to formula”.
Marvel has already told the story the stories they wanted to tell. It's all been done. Now they are just making films and TV shows to keep the cash flow going and when u do something just to make money it's usually never as good as somebody making something because they have a story to tell.
Christian Bale was the best part of it and they wasted his character.
This movie sucked!
I agree with you.  I thought the supervillains, Hela and Gorr", were done very well for both Thor films.   My problem is Thor himself and the storeyline.  I am not a fan of them trying really hard to put "comedy" in Thor.  I much prefer more serious acting and plot.  Then the storyline itself is lacking substance.   They could have spent an extra 10 min on developing Jane's story and how she is able to control the Hammer and becomes a female Thor.  She literally goes from seeing the Hammer in the display to a full on superhero with ZERO footage to backup.  The whole storyline seems "choppy".  They also could have developed more of Gorr's story.  I really like the opening of the movie.
Too many dry uneccessary jokes that compromised the movie ? Could have been a lot better
Pay attention that in all the video thumbnails he has a smile just like in Grace’s Beyond the trailer channel. These two used to tear a lot of movies and shows apart and now they don’t do that anymore. Everything they watch mostly makes them happy. I am disappointed by every MCU and show lately. They follow the same formula - comedy and more focus on side characters. They were never like that. MCU turning into one giant rehash! Anyways I stopped watching Chris’s and Grace’s reviews awhile ago… just came here to say that… bye
One of the worst major release films I’ve seen in a long time
So two thors & one vylkarie fail to defeat the gorr. 😂
From all the review for thor i understood that it sucks ...lol!!i agree chris shang chi was great  and definitely i am going for the third time to see tom gun ,!!!
I kinda regret jumping down into the comment section... People just act stupid. Accept that people and their views change. Chris used to be going all in, now he's not, boohoo, cry me a river. Am I the only person, that realizes, that if you want to exist within the industry, it would be great to NOT burn bridges with everybody? Simple as that!
I couldn't take Thor nor the stakes seriously given the general tone of the movie, Ragnarok had a very fine balance which wasn't present here. It undermined Bale's Gorr performance, I feel like this would have been a better movie if it was directed by Scott Derrickson or Raimi.
this is kinda sad , we all saw Chris escape the oppression of his former religion and now he self imposes censorship upon himself to not upset the industry he is currently working in while i understand it i will no longer watch anything he produces as the loss of integrity is obvious with this  " review"  school dinners have more effort and substance than whatever this was suppose to be .
Looks like a one note director
I like Thor’s personality in Avengers imo that’s him at his best he was still funny but he wasn’t a goof like what they turned him into in the later films
Is a bad movie. Plain and simple. Bad concept and idea from beginning to end. By the way , i cant believe you actually liked ragnarok....😳
Cmon guys just say it the movie sucked!!! It was a joke literally turned the marvel universe into a b-rated sit com!!!!
Horrible cringe politically correct ass kissing  How people can watch that no idea
Clearly, they gave Taika free reign, and he exposed himself.
I hate the overall tone of Marvel movies. This could have been grade, but every secpnd sentence must be a joke.
I really don’t know about this movie like I have very mixed feelings about it. On the one hand I loved Gore‘s story because in some respects it is pretty dang relatable. What do you do in the entire world seems to have turned on you and you have nothing left? On the other hand. I thought they relied way too heavily on Guns N’ Roses to carry the film, there are three songs by this band in this film and then on top of that you’ve got a little character sequence and I’m just like um,,,  why? Can you come up with something a little better? I enjoyed the film overall especially the humor I don’t know I’d say it was better than some of the other marvel movies but not quite as good as Ragnarok or even the first Thor.  Of course I was a person who did not like Spider-Man no way home as much as everybody else and I was also a person who was not as entertain with Multiverse of madness which of the two big ones that were supposed to be a major blockbusters of  phase four. Although I did get to see it in IMAX which was a privilege that was kind of unexpected due to one of the theaters being down that was showing it that day. So that was kind of nice.
Bro Disney is killing the MCU
*To the people disappointed in the new direction this channel is taking:*  Let's get one thing out of the way: Yeah, I also found Stuckmann's channel more entertaining when he gave grades for movies and made his yearly best/worst-lists. I miss this stuff, but still I wouldnt call his new direction a disappointment or even a "sell-out".   Selling out would be, if Chris continued his old concept just to get more clicks, even if he doesn't like doing it anymore. What's happening right now, is the exact opposite. Like another commenter here already said, it's a transitional phase. Those phases are always a little murky and this is reflected by the content. The content still isn't fully adapted to the new direction and hasn't found it's groove yet. It's a in-between kinda thing. Which might make the content seem a little wishy-washy sometimes. Like there's still something missing.   But when it comes to Chris, I know he'll get there eventually. It's not the first transitional phase he went through, even if those earlier phases might have been not that obvious. So instead of using shallow phrases like "selling out", the more interesting question would be: *Why do you watch this channel?*  Is it because you are interested in Chris as a person? Or do you simply need another movie reviewer who is praising the movies you love and trashing the movies you hate? If it's the latter, you'll find a ton of those on youtube. Many of them doing the same stuff for over a decade now. But by your logic, delivering the same lame product over and over again, doesn't mean selling out. ;)  If you watch, because you are interested in Chris as a person, this transitional phase is a very interesting thing to witness. Yes, it might not be as entertaining as before. Yes, it might be a little bumpy and not every video feels as well rounded as the older stuff. But still, after following this channel for ca. 10 years now, for me it is really exciting to see Chris finally get to this point of his life. Because after watching him for so long, it was always very obvious how much he was longing to get there.   In his whole career as a movie reviewer there were always those little moments where you could feel he wanted to do something else. Even many years ago he already stated on several occasions that trashing movies isn't really that much fun for him. That he has so much respect for the movie making process and that it's getting harder for him to talk negatively about the creative endeavors of people who might have failed, but who still put tons of work and passion into the creation of the movie.   Chris began to realize how many things can go wrong during a movie production and that sometimes it's just that one decision that can destroy your whole work. A decision you might not have any influence on. A studio decision, a marketing decision, a budget decision... whatever. After realizing that Chris became more interested to find out how the whole production process works on a professional level and why it can go so incredibly wrong many times, but also can turn out so incredibly amazing many other times. This did interest him much more than simply saying "movie bad" or "movie good" and give grades that often were very one-sided and didn't fully reflect his whole opinion about the movie.   For me the answer to "Why do you watch this channel?" is pretty clear: I'm watching because I'm interested in Chris as a person. At first it might have been just the reviews, but over the span of all those many years, watching Stuckmann's personal journey (from movie nerd to movie critic to movie maker, while also becoming a husband and father inbetween) was what made me continue watching. It not only made me continue watching, it made me grow a much bigger personal attachment to this channel than most others. When Chris is releasing a new video, for me it's not just new content to waste some time and be entertained. No, it's more like a new page in a diary of a person I really like and appreciate.   So if your only reason for being here is to watch more of the same movie critic content that you can find plentiful on youtube, I somehow understand your disappointment. But if you're here for the person behind the content, this transitional phase is one of the most exciting periods this channel has ever gone through: finally witnessing how Chris Stuckmann is able to fulfill his lifelong dream.   Greetings from Germany :)
With given time and money, id direct a better movie than this one
So true about the marketing for these movies. It’s like they know it’s not good but say it’ll be fine because everyone likes it. They need to be careful with that. 😂
I liked it.
The people who made this movie completely disrespected themselves only.. I hate the fact that it's a Taika movie.
I think marvel made enough money to not give a damn anymore and that's the new phase.  Also I don't think is weird as a movie director to critic movies on the internet, specially when That literally made your career at first, I do think is weird to stop being honest just because you joined that market, what would be the next step, deleting your whole channel as soon as you find success? That, I find ridiculous.
I thought the movie was a great time!
Was excited to see Christan bale as an evil however this is worst Thor movie ever
Its a bad movie period!
honestly hope this theme park franchise ends....even the artists treat is a joke and source of easy money...it will turn a profit no matter what crap they do...a lot of people are realising this now what some understood 10 years back...copy paste corporate them park rides
2:37 aaah. So that's why you still haven't reviewed The Matrix Resurrections. While I respect you moving on to do other things I think it's a shame to lose a critical reviewer just stating his honest opinion. But I see more people think that way reading some comments. Now, on to continue watching your review :D
Review starts @2:10  Yes, really.....
It's thorbin time
On the road to 2 Million subscribers!
Definitely won't be watching any of your reviews again
The best marvel movie is Logan
Stop kissing ass, stop praising the makers of this movie .is this a review or what?
'Thor: Love & Thunder' is the 'Batman & Robin' of Thor movies. I hope history repeats itself going forward.
Haven’t seen it but is it safe to place a 10k bet on their being a Lgbtq related scene in this movie ?
If i may, are you gonna make a review for incantation.?
I like a Lot , nod a popular opinion
That was not a review... He was just saying that he saw a movie he did not like that much. The quality on this channel took a nosedive a long time ago. I think it's time to move on. Unsubscribed.
This is not a review
I loved this movie and more so twice I just loved how silly and sweet this was
it was visually ugly
2:10
Wasn’t there a 4 hour cut originally
this guy iss ultimate shill  , of course you met the producer............
Movie was garbage. Go woke, go broke.
I would say that phase 4 is probably my least favorite phase of the MCU. It just feels like marvel is rushing out content and isn't focusing on storytelling. After coming off of my favorite phase of the MCU, which is phase 3, it seems like the MCU needs some kind of direction. Phases 1-3 have infinity stones, assembling the avengers, and Thanos, but phase 4 just has a bunch of random projects thrown in. Hopefully black panther 2 won't be a disappointment like thor 4, eternals, black widow, and MOM. Without Chadwick Boseman, I just don't think black panther will ever feel the same again.
I’m really hating phase 4, nearly every movie (besides spider man) I’ve been pretty bored.
The weird press tells me that the team is unhappy and the movie was kinda butchered by the head honchos. Makes me think there's probably a "director's cut" of it that's much better. Here's hoping that, if I'm right, Marvel does release that cut.
This was a weak-ass review.
I feel like the purpose of  marvel films like this are to simply give fans a mental break  Not every film has to be a mind boggling , critically acclaimed gem 💎
I really like this film
He straight up reviewed this movie like a politician 🤦🏾‍♂️ everything that came out his mouth was calculated and carful not to offend the big guys in the DISNEY MCU Empire!😂😂😂🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️😂
Gorr was great but severely underutilized, female Thor was good too but other than that, the film is rushed and not well put together. It’s sad because MCU now just can’t keep up post End Game. They’ve lost some touch. I really hope they do better on the next films, I highly anticipate Blade tho.
The problem is that people still give Disney the benefit of the doubt
What is the point of only reviewing movies you like? Anyone can do that. It really makes reviews pointless.
Guys, don’t give Chris Stuckmann any money. He is not in any way a trained director. He is one of millions of people who love watching movies and he decided to use his YouTube fame as a way to get you to donate to him.  There are film students who spent countless time and money to learn, to work on movie sets as an extra, learning and many of them will NEVER get a chance to direct. But here Chris Stuckmann comes here, gives a bunch of superficial reviews for movies he likes, writes a book about anime. And that’s it.
Review Elvis please
I really think you missed the nuance of what taika was saying about the VFX. He was implying it was him . Sarcastically.
2 minutes of advertisement. Wtf
The film was wank.
jesus christ a 9 minute video and it doesn't start until 2 minutes 9 seconds in...
I did like the bold take for the villain.  The disillusionment in God is rare for a Disney movie
I haven't seen love and thunder but I'm starting to think that Marvel is gone with Stan lee.
You said you would only day positive things. So you liked it and it was great. Except it's terrible woke shit.
these new reviews feel fake
Alot of people are saying it's a bit all over the place and more crazy because it's all being told from krog doing the story telling which is f n awesome!
OH COME ON, it’s THOR. What’s not to love??? Music was on point.  I don’t think we needed anymore gruesomeness from Gorr. The visual was creepy enough. The joking and seriousness was very balanced in my feeble opinion, as a moviegoer for 60 years who grew up on King Kong, Bogie, Busby Berkley musicals as well as Siskel and Ebert, and Gene Shalit before them!  I only follow the MCU because of my millennial, Gen Y and Gen Z children.    And I LOVE IT.
There were 2 main issues. The first it was obviously not enough in story as if it was just a 2 hour preview for a movie vs an actual movie. The second is that the movie took things so unseriously that deadpools movies felt more serious.
I feel like with every video you upload, you’re eyes are get further & further apart.
I get the no grades,  I disagree, but I get it.  If you're going to lean into that though, you should voice why you think parts of a film failed for you structurally.  I don't want you to become so soft on other filmmakers you don't analyze. We fail to learn how you think mistakes in script and screening might have been avoided.
I agree with evrything you said. Theeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen you said top gun was great and you lost me!
I’m definitely the odd man out here. I like this more than Ragnarok
I haven't seen it but the movie looks really good. The graphics and costumes are really awesome. I'm honestly not a big marvel fan, but some of the these new movies they've put out are really good. I am really looking forward to you're movie though, Shelby Oaks, Chris. I think we need more movies like that. I used to watch a lot of movies like those back in the day and I think they're really good.
i love how you can just look at Chris’ thumbnails and you immediately know what he thinks
Korg ruined the movie......kids will love it, but the jokes were too much. Thor isn't meant to be stupid, but in this reality he is.  The change of tone every 2 minutes jolted you out of the movie, and everything that you thought had happened, ended up being zero consquences. Even death......oh no, just a kidney.....why are they scared killing characters off?
No offense but you talk too much about absolutely nothing. The first 2 minutes of your 9 minute video was a sponsor for wall art. Then for 3 minutes you spoke about yourself and how you'd produce a movie as someone who is "spending time learning to be a producer". I think I learned more about you and your hobbies than I did about the movie which is why i came here in the first place. I just feel like this 9 minute video gave no value to my opinion on the movie for better or worse and now i have to hop to the next video.
Christian Bale was the best part of the movie for sure!!!
Weak ass review. Selling out won't make your movie good
THOR love and jokes
Please review RRR
Entertaining? I think disappointing is a better interpretation.
I liked the movie. I didn't love it. I came away feeling like, "Too much money, not enough time."
Marvel should just start all over lol.
Movie was just OK. Soundtrack needed help. Just having f-ing Guns N Roses was a lazy approach. They should just went in another direction and go the Night House soundtrack route where basically it revolves around the Richard Thompson song "Calvary Cross".
I’m just waiting till Cinemasins makes a video and immediately sins it for the narrations
Beware of PS5 scams guys as I just got taken for one. I normally am better at weeding these out. However this was a text link to what looked like Chris's profiles page. I should have noticed the 1 subscriber which should have given it away. Well live & learn as expensive lessons. Interesting to hear your guys scammed stories. :/
Sweet shirt dude
It was horrible.  Nothing else to say.
This movie was a bore. I wasted my cash on this crap and walked out of the theater. Nope! Try again marvel.
"I don't do bad reviews anymore."  Think of what Siskel and Ebert would say.  This channel went seriously down the damn politicaly correct toilet. Unsubscribed.
its not terrible to look at a movie  as a rough cut.... that is fucking silly to say and think.....   just cuz fucking Marty said it doesnt mean its true... get outta here with that shit... lol...
Man I love your channel. Please do not be afraid to make negative reviews. Some of those videos were my favorites. Your reviews of Cats and DB Evolution were 2 of my favorite videos from the channel lol.
you know, chris hemsworth claimed that if thor was not funny, he would not play him anymore. plus he sticking his kids on screen that just tells me he will do like one movie more then send thor suit to the recycle bin. and that is fine by me. if he is tired of it then lets move on with a new actor that actually wanna play thor's and not just like a funny moron.
I really did like this movie, but I viewed it as more of a standalone film. It will have an impact with future stories, but for the most part it felt like a really self-contained movie. It had some parts that I found funny and other parts definitely felt like they tried too hard. It was also rough around the edges in some parts, but I still had a good time. I'm definitely glad I didn't watch a million trailers for it because it feels that lately most movies, especially MCU stuff, shows WAYYY too much in the trailers. I don't need to see the whole movie in the trailer. I'm hoping that future Thor movies aren't quite as silly as this was because I enjoyed how he was in Ragnorak, but in this movie there were times when he went way overboard and it just felt like lazy writing. Oh, and it also feels like they cut an insane amount out of this movie. Some parts just did not gel together from scene to scene and it felt like we were missing something that would have tied it all together better. Plus Christian Bale wasn't utilized as much as I'd have liked. I know I'm shredding it a bit, but I did have fun with the movie. It wasn't as good as Ragnorak though.
Displate steals art.
for me it was the dark elements of the movie , it was kinda dark
Personally I really enjoyed this movie, but in recent times I've avoided any trailers or promotional material for entertainment I already know I'm likely to see, I've found it increases my enjoyment of the product a whole lot more. Additionally while still finding most MCU films entertaining, I'm not really invested in any 'seriousness' of it after Endgame. If I still took most of these movies seriously I can see why some people wouldn't enjoy it.
I’m the only one I know experiencing this Mandela effect, but it used to be Chris “Stuckerman”
where was the review? what was your review score?
Chris, in this video you basically just said this is no longer a movie review channel but instead a movie recommendation channel. I'm happy that you have the opportunity to make your own films and I will support them! However, I do not watch your channel for movie recommendations I watch it for reviews. This decision compromises your professional integrity as a reviewer and therefore devalues the critiques and opinions you give, I sincerely hope you course correct or myself and probably others will go elsewhere for this content.
jokes are too cheesy and there is no actual god butchering scenes, it feels like this movie is like a side quest of a videogame, nothing is important. The finale battle was very anti climactic because of the kids involved, i just cant handle the scene which kids holding teddy bear, kids like 3-7 yrs old fighting it was just terrible. There are entertaining scenes and fighting scenes and the GOATS are the real mvp. over all this movie is 6/10
You are NO longer a reliable reviewer. You just suck up to movie studios thinking about your "future" projects. It's PATHETIC!!!!!
It is very weird that they publicly spoke about the VFX in that way. That's a bit yuck.
This is the fairest review I’ve seen so far. The movies been given too much hate
Talk about a "kid gloves" review. What happened to Stuckman? That was a wishy washy review. All gums, no teeth.
Everything Post-Endgame has either been a crushing disappointment, a meandering waste of time, or just straight up not up to par. You know why? The star of the damn show was killed off. Not only is there a charisma vacuum, an Iron Man shaped black hole at the heart of the MCU now, there's nothing driving these newer movies and shows at all besides the promise of some nostalgia bait from this multiverse 'plot line', which is just a cynical excuse to have a revolving door of actors prop up what is now a hollow, cynical husk of a franchise. Everything pre-Infinity War was all tethered to this backburner promise of one day having a party with Iron Man, the main protagonist, audience anchor point and driving force of the whole thing, played by the irreplaceable Robert Downey Jr. Endgame was the end folks.
You’ve gone soft as baby shit in your reviews, just because you’re making movies doesn’t mean you can’t review and critique other peoples movies, as professional or elite as they may be. It’s really taking the teeth out of your channel, which was what gave you the notoriety to begin with
i think the jankiness of the vfx was intentional, at least that's how i read it. janky vfx to up the hamminess of look and feel of the it
Lordy, what a let-down of a movie!! Too cheesy and TV episody feel for me. My wife even said 'meh.'
Three stories mashed up into one - disaster.
Zeus was horrible. This film was a travesty. The tone has gone from funny to ridiculous.
Here's a thought. Hardly anyone will see your movie except your die-hard fans. You got famous as an honest reviewer. Since you have sold out your integrity in hopes that it will keep your fan base alive, I and many others who have kept your channel afloat for years are abandoning it for honest creators who do not have delusions of grandeur. That said, I hope your movie was worth it. Peace.
This plate?. Points at bowl
WHAT THIS POOR MOVIE CRITIC MISSES ,LIKE ALMOST EVERY OTHER CRITIC= IT THE MOVIE IS A STORY BEING TOLD BY KORG TO A BUNCH OF ASGAURDIAN CHILDREN- THE STORY IOS ABOUT THE HERO THOR, FROM KPORGS POINT OF VIEW
if you liked shang-chi, then ill say thor movie is a huge bomb.
Every single marvel everything after No Way Home, feels like it has no plan. The mcu has no direction now. And marvel/disney is just throwing out random characters and stories like a box of Skittles. Hope next year is better. Not hopefully at this point..
Thor Ragnarök ruined Hulk's WWHulk storyline, as well as Korg and Miek. MoM is basically Scarlett as WWHulk. Hulk got treated even worse, and serious characters are just comedic relief now.
Passive protagonists don't belong in action movies
i have been reading marvel comics since a child in 1963= This is the first marvel movie to tell one of those kinds of stories all the way through- i finally got to see one- Stan Lee and Jack Kirby would be proud of this movie=go see it for yourself- you will be pleased.
Well, it's clear that Chris has sold out. It's really sad, since I have enjoyed his reviews. This is his second consecutive review in which he's clearly pandering and, dare I say it? Lying to his audience. I am genuinely sorry it's come to this, and I understand where he's coming from since he's in an industry that requires this kind of BS. Goodbye, Chris, at least as being an honest reviewer goes.
Yea I struggggled with this movie. 6/10 at best
The movie absolutely sucked shit. And it's what you should have said in this video.
That shirt 🔥
Thor was definitely disappointing. Lots of flaws. Russell Crowe sounded like Mario when he talked and he seemed dumb as a brick. The guardians of the galaxy were barely in it. Gorr the God butcher was barely in it either. I kept expecting some phenomenal acting scene with Bale and it just never happened. It was kind of annoying how Jane and Thor just almost basically teleport anywhere instantly at just the right moment. Just so cliché. Very little fighting compared to the comedy. So much comedy they're starting to ruin Thor like they did with the Hulk. Marvels actually starting to destroy some of their best characters. The post credit scene was really disappointing too because Hercules looked like a dork.
You guys are missing the point of the movie. It was seen through the eyes of gorg, being that’s he narrating in the beginning. That’s why it’s more comedic that serious. If gorg was not telling the story, then you would have seen more of gorr and serious thor. That’s also why you don’t see gorr kill anyone because gorg wasn’t there
hate the advertising
They're fumbling their phase 4
I would give it a B-
Worst movie since dark world in the mcu
I missed his rating
Gorr was the best part of this movie
Just not a good movie. I like the script. Honestly I thik the problem was in Director himself and decissions made in editing room by director. Waititi is victim of his style. He wants us to know that this is his movie. I think with the same script but different talented director this movie would be better.
The movie was entertaining but you're right. Pacing was off. The movie was also way too light hearted.
I liked it.
It was trash to much woke stuff killed it even more
It’s so dumb that you won’t criticize movies just because you’re making them. Like, what? How does that make sense? Your old reviews were so much better because you’d actually say what you were thinking without oatantly pulling every punch.
I thought Thor love and thunder was great and a lot of people say Gorr the god butcher was waisted but I thought he was the best MCU villain in a long time
Bale will never cease to amaze me.
When tha shadows started taking forms I thought straight away, the scene from ghost . But ghost ws terrifying where this wasn't
You just made excuses for a bad movie dude. Going forward I’ll stick with actual film review channels. Thanks for nothing.
I still don't understand not reviewing films you don't like, as it says you don't like the film, but you won't talk about it. To me, it's perfectly okay to be critical, even if your a film maker. I've made films, they are nowhere near perfect, hit I can still be critical of others. Idk, it's odd to me, considering I've watched nearly all of the hilariousicity videos
this movie deserves a Director's Cut. We all know it.
Please please if you do a review on The Outlaws (2018) i swear i'll subscribe to you <3
Woke crap, plot was junk. Who wants to see Disney deconstruct Thor?  :/
I don't think this movie will affect any of the others. This was just some insane thing that the director decided to do and, they let him, for whatever reason. It was entertaining but like you said I'll watch Ragnarok way more than this one. I think the thing that really throws people off is the bits that are stories told by Kronk they seem really rushed and weird. I look at those as being what they are, his interpretation of events but not the actual event. He makes them bigger and much sillier for his child audience.
it sucked....the comedy should be sprinkled on the serious for it to work.....the the whole movie was a comedy....thor just lost his mom,dad,brother,woman,people.....no way he looks like a dum dum doing dumb stuff being stoopid!!...loved the goats though.
This was a big letdown.  Stupid Thor, underused Gorr, slapstick comedy, sloppy writing.  Some enjoyable moments for sure but it could have been much, much better.
Hi Chris and followers, I received a comment response from a Clone account saying I won the PS five. Just be on the lookout. I flagged it as spam, I was so excited, but then I felt like a schmuck for following through. Oh well.
If there is too much comedy and everything is a joke it's hard for the audience to care. They might find it funny but there is no emotional investment. the movie dropped 80% in the box office since last week. That might be the reason.
people hatin on this way too much
This was the goofy Thor film, not only him,  other characters were also mocked. Christian Bale made a great job but was underused. And the scene of the kids being given Thor’s powers and then fighting even with their toys was ridiculous. Personally, didn’t like this movie.
I enjoyed Love and Thunder for the most part. My only complaint is Gorr. Bale looked amazing but I didn’t get a sense of him being menacing. He killed one god and the rest was simply mentioned. Would have been nice to see him butcher more gods. I do agree that phase 4 has been kind of awkward. Hopefully the next four movies will land.
Definitely seems like they didn't really know what they were doing with the movie. From a lot of the stuff thats been coming out such as MCU VFX departments feeling rushed, quotes about shooting a bunch of stuff that didn't even get used and just throwing together what seemed like it worked best this just seemed like kind of a mess. Looking back now with how long it took to get the first teaser, it seems likely that even up to a few months before the release they didn't really know exactly what this movie was. It was a fun movie, I didn't dislike it, but seems like such a miss in a lot of ways and waiting almost 5 years for another solo Thor movie seemed sort of disappointing. MoM and this both seem kind of lazy or just don't have a strong direction and the MCU seems more focused on just cool looking shots/scenes than the dialogue/character interactions/story that had made the studio so successful by not just making "another comic book movie".
It sucked,. Yes i said it..
T. Waititi is becoming a one trick pony with his screenwriting. Not everything has to be a joke, and hes relying too heavily on comedy. Theres a difference between humor, and comedy.
Man, you should watch Kung Fury if you haven't seen it. It's on Youtube and is a breeze to watch with a runtime of about 30 minutes. Sort of an 80's style action-comedy spoof made by like one guy (with a little help). I thought it was pretty funny, you might like it.
Stuckmann hitting rock bottom one day at a time.
That shirt is everything 😍 best game of all time!
Also, Natalie Portman said alot of her blood sweat and tears is on the cutting room floor. 4 Hours was the orginal cut.
Ok I'll say it. This movie sucked. Yeah I said it..
Personally I really don’t like Thor ragnorock
I miss the MCU phase 1-3. Way to much bad comedy and not taking the characters and plot seriously killed this movie for me. 4/10 won’t watch again.
Since a lot of people I know also liked the comedy I guess it’s a matter of taste. I wasn’t really a fan. I felt like this movie mocked previous movies and the entire asgardian world and it’s characters. I mean…new asgard is a literal joke.
It SUCKS it’s Garbage….. Its for Children, Its Fucking Garbage
This was the logical problem they were going to run into with this huge movie making McDonalds called the MCU, they're so busy keeping with such a tight schedule that eventually they had to sacrifice their overall quality. It's a huge business with lots of shareholders behind it, they see time as an asset and they know that they will never lose their cult-like fanbase.  This is a trend we've been witnessing with the past several movies and Streaming shows since End Game.  So far, the best has been No Way Home, you could tell there was real love for the project.
I find people who were unhappy with this movie for being "Rushed" are being ungrateful. I understand trying to help Marvel take more time with movies for their perfection.
Did he give a score or???
get this man to 2 mil
Watch RRR
I hope you and EVERYONE torrents Scamazon's Rings of Wokeness. Don't give them the ratings they need.
This movie is garbage, that Tiki Tiki or whateva director made it into parody at Scary movie level. He should be canceled
GORR SHOULDVE GOTTEN A PART TWO!
I made a video about this movie too and I agree with the overall sentiment that they have gotten too campy and silly with this character. A lot of the serious tone that was present in these movies has been drained out for The Office type humor which makes the overall marketing kind of silly and extremely nonchalant as well… STILL ENJOYED THE HELL OUT OF IT
Saw this movie yesterday... left the theater thinking, "That was just okay."  Same thing I thought after Shang-Chi and Dr. Strange MoM.  It seems to me, the jokes sometimes are a bit too much.
Dude, why are you so afraid to criticize something now. You are a critic. That's why you have this following. Here, it feels like you are trying so hard to find the things you liked with this while saying you'll never watch it again. Those two things don't go together and that's why it feels fake. You are a good critic, I don't understand why you have wanted to distance yourself from your roots. It's almost like selling out.
I can't agree with you more, me and my husband were quite disappointed from the movie.... Recently however, we started a new tv show-. Severance. Did you have a chance to see that? So good 😌
This movie was pretty bad imo. It felt all over the place.
Yes Gorr should of had way more screen time
Christ Stuckman became such a dissapointment. Like Oh i dont review movies i didnt liked. what is this a kindergarden stuff? So now you becae a sh*ll?
GARBAGE MOVIE I’d prefer to hear more about your experience making your movie Chris. At least I know that is going to have an actual story, characters that make sense and have agency and purpose, and arcs that truly tell the viewer something and allow them to connect to the movie.   This POS did none of that. Watiti is completely overrated. Sorry but true. The actors are all fine. The writing is absolute pure garbage. Watiti is not good at this genre but is too much of an egotist to admit that
You sort of have yo be from nz to get the comedy side of it. I'm do happy our comedy is getting showcased on a huge film like this I loved the comedy parts of the movie better than the storyline. It's hard to understand nz comedy and won't be funny cos u just don't get it but come here and hang with the Maoris ND you'll get it
sick shirt
I fell asleep in the cinema watching this
RRR movie with a budget of $72 million beats this high budget Marvel movie of $250 million by a great margin any day..a must watch movie if you want to have a good time enjoying....
Skip the ads to 2:10
Chris did you ever see the Northman? Really wanted to see your review
I guess this is the end for Chris and his truly objective opinion, he desperately wants to be a Movie (Hollywood) Insider and is petrified of saying anything truly critical about movies now. The only ones who are really going to listen to him now are sycophants. It's a shame I used to enjoy his channel
Quite liked this movie. Heard it was too goofy and heard Thor was a joke, but I found Thor to be a good character. He had some character development, I felt like he had an answer to everything. Second part was a lot better than the first. I wanted more Gorr mayhem and I didn't like a certain group of characters getting á certain power, other than that it was a pretty good movie. 8.143/10
Soo what did he grade the film?😂🤷🏾‍♂️
When Thor kissed Jane it was like a roided out Fabio making out with an old lady. 🤢🤢🤢
What a bad review. It was utter woke trash
This movie had no story telling, too much humor, not enough coherent plot, and was childish. And the fact that you met taika waititi and was star struck, won't change it.
Displate
I really wanted to love it... as I did with Ragnarok. But I didn't. I like comedies... this was more on the corny side. Too over the top to care about the story. It felt messy, convoluted, and didn't make me laugh that much.
Woke crap. Shoving it in our faces. RIP MCU.
They had an amazing opportunity with Bale to address the moral complexity of who and why gods are and get to be. They addressed none of it. He got no brilliant philosophical villain speech or moral exploration. I'm sure Bale is furious with the final edit.
Try I don't know...painting or an easy art before you make some turd no one watches. Your reviews are obviously poorly written and you can't be truthful with even yourself let alone the world. Do you even know who you are as an individual?
This movie wasn’t Ragnarok. I didn’t think it was bad. I enjoyed seeing it in theaters. I know that the final cut was much shorter than the original 4 hours run time so I wonder how much good stuff was cut from the film. I felt like Gor was underutilized which was disappointing because Christian Bale was awesome in the role. It wasn’t the best or worst movie from phase 4 but still very fun imo
I feel like Phase 4 is the weakest phase
This is trending!!..?
I’m liking for your tshirt alone
you are lying tooth and nail about not wanting to talk bad about movies. The truth is, it's not weird at all but you want the daddies of Hollywood to adopt you.
Marvel has diluted these movies
Seen top gun 4 times!
Can you do Jurassic world dominion review?
ya it was good, but infinity war was good with thor
Thor grew from a boy to a man from the early movies to infinity war and end-game. Now he has reverted back to a child and his love story seems adolescent at best.
When are you going to review Stranger Things S4?
Disney is killing Marvel with too much movies and shows. They cant focus and maintain quality.
Chris, I know you are a big horror buff, would you review Incantation on netflix?
Lol this guy is absolutely insufferable. Never gonna make it as a filmmaker
It’s obvious Chris doesn’t want to alienate his chances in Hollywood with the people who may ask him to join them on a new project they’re working on after he’s given their old work some praise. Even if it wasn’t really deserved. That ladies and gentlemen is called a “Sell out.”
I think its safe to say that Marvel have jumped the shark with this movie. It was a mess that made no sense in the context of the MCU. It also introduces lore that is ridiculous.
I can sum it up in 1 word. Garbage. There is no excuse. There's plenty of source material to reference. Yet they have to take the woke approach, not the true classic marvel approach. After all, that was what made Marvel great in the first place. "F" Marvel/Disney.
It’s ok to say the film was 💩  Natalie Portman was great and best thing in film   Chris was ok not great  Bale was under used - no point him doing that film .  No reason why he got those powers from that sword   Child kidnapping is just a joke holds no weight in this film  This film proves it is possible to try be too funny.  This is the end of marvel - it’s turning into DC
this has woke all over it. the movie sucked. so did jurassic park it was bad, dr strange also bad. hollywood is crap now.
It was an awful cheap looking load of garbage aimed at kids and kidults ... read the vastly better graphic novels and forget this interpretation!!
how to be a sold out.  a) start by dealing sponsorship that pays lots b) lie in your audience that you will be honest and then don’t be c) try to capitalise on your brand and be dishonest to your audience. your audience loves you because you were honest but now you need both to satisfied them but also do not go agains the people you were crotons up to a year ago that’s tart working for them. d) make a video just for the views with no hart and full of lies that you enjoyed something you did not  felt really diassapointed with this one.. stuckman use to be one of these places that you were hearing a non bias opinion.. and here we end up…
What a waste for Christian Bale to be in this movie.
It's a great movie.
This was a Thor parody basically
I think a quick backstory for The God Butcher woulda been nice. That way we’re more in our feels for Gor
He speaks of the old times, the funny times, the A Ants Life times.
Another meh Marvel movie!!!
So is Chris back to actually be able to provide constructive criticism on movies he doesnt like or is he still a hack?
Marvel seems to have trouble with even number phases.
I think definitely see Gorr take down gods, but either have it that he goes to Earth and Thor is there with all the Avengers/GotG, making him decide to flee and draw Thor away, and the Avengers/GotG stay behind to protect Earth or don't have him go to Earth at all.  Having Gorr leave the battle just made him look weak when it was only Thor et al there. His plan was to draw out Thor anyway, why go through the hoops?
man I got to be honest I have not been a fan of Tessa Thompson ever since first seeing her on screen. maybe it just has to do with the types of characters she chooses but there's not a movie or show I've seen her in where she isn't constantly making that condescending sarcastic ass face of hers. she always looks like she's right on the edge of passive aggressively roasting somebody. I know I can't be the only one right?
Thor is like a circus. You have a satire comedy on the other hand you have a kiddie  friendly and also some cheesy corny love story.
You can't review a movie without critical thinking. You don't review movies anymore. A better use of your time is to completely rethink your channel and slowly let it become something else entirely. If you can't come straight out and say honestly that a majority of this movie was a dumpster fire, then you're not being honest and there isn't a reason to come here to see your reviews. Because you don't make honest reviews, you say a few words and run because you're in the "Industry" now. It's a shame, you used to give open honest reviews... I miss those days...
Top gun is so good
They not letting nothing out on black panther THOR IS AN OUTLIER
I enjoyed what there was of the movie, but it definitely could’ve used 20 more minutes of story development. Building up the character arcs, motivation, and tone are so important. That’s what differentiates this movie from Ragnarok. I would’ve loved to seen a montage of Jane as mighty Thor, perhaps a female rock ballad of her saving lives and doing mighty things. Definitely we needed more butchering from Gore. He didn’t seem as villainous as he could’ve been. I would’ve loved to of seen a few gods from the other shows in this. It all seems disconnected. And even just a little more explanation about how Korg got his body back. We spent at least two or three movies seen Groot regrow, but cord just has a body all of a sudden. 20 more minutes could have made this film from good to great.
Thor luvin' Thunder wasn't my favorite. First of all, it only plays in this one sketchy theater in town. And second, I didn't think the big guy playing Thunder was really committed to the role.
I’m actually bummed they leaned too hard into the comedy. They spent all these movies getting Thor from young and reckless and I worthy but wanting to be king to being worthy but understands he isn’t quite ready (though he is) and it’s just turned into Thor giving you the kingdom and becoming a joke. It’s sad his character progression was moving in such a good place. The movies are fun and I enjoy it but it’s just… meh. I won’t be rewatching this one.
Does Marvel have a "big bad" to replace Thanos yet? If not, I feel that is what is missing.  A lot of the investment we have put into these stories revolves around the idea that all of these characters matter in a grander sceme.   A lot of that is lost when the films (while entertaining!) feel disposable.
My theory on why Disney is allowing the filmmakers and actors to talk about this film so dismissively is because they're trying to deflect criticism. Like "Yeah we know this movie isn't well made but we're not taking this movie seriously so you shouldn't criticize it."
Am I a winner Chris for a video game system?  Please let me know.
Lol I saw Top Gun 3 times as well. The 3rd time was in IMAX. Glad to hear you're seeing it again!
Since you've seen top gun maverick 3 times can we get a spoiler talk plz
They butchered the god butcher. Fucking called it as soon as I saw his design. Garbage. Film was okay at best. Ragnarok remains the best Thor film still and it’s not even close tbh.
I really liked it actually. Watched it with my younger brother whos around 13. We laughed the entire movie and had a great time. Sure it wasnt as good as Ragnarok. But I miss laughing at the cinema. Hadnt watched a movie this fun in a very long time☀️ The mcu is so serious nowdays and the Marvel-humour often miss the mark for me. But this was great. The majority seems to dislike this one, but just wait till the next mcu-flick. And after this response the next Thor movie will probably be darker and less funny ❤️
Taika Waititi, like Michael Bay, is a one-trick pony. His style doesn't work for everything. Thor, especially this latest offering, is one of them. It feels like we have 3 very different versions of Thor across all the Marvel movies he's appeared in. That's not a good thing.
maybe the pandemic really had an effect on it..
So beyond tired of superhero movies.  95% of it on green screens
Terribel move, comic Thor.
It would not hurt to have a peer review process for filmmakers
Seen Thor Love & Thunder 3 times now. It gets worse each time. I had more enthusiasm with Twilight.
please put in your title whether it is spoiler free or not, otherwise we wouldn't bother.
without christian bale this could easily one of the worst marvel movie
Mcu died along side Stan Lee. We are now in the MidCU
Please review Green lantern beware my power animated movie
Would not waste time or money watching this grooming brainwashing movie.
Did this channel get hijacked? I keep getting PS5 contest messages.
I went into the movie with very low expectations. It did not look good...an even with low expectations it didn't meet them..if I was grading it I would give it a D-.. it was to kiddy, childish an they continue to dumb down Thor's character!!  Like a dumb jock that they try to make funny
The movie was as passable as every Marvel film for a while now. Its hype’d up amidst its release, get promoted to no end, movie drops, 1000x Things you miss Channels do their thing, and on to the next one.
Two differences between Love and Thunder and Ragnarok that I've personally learned over the last few days: Taika Watiti co-wrote the former in addition to directing it and Marvel mandated that the final cut was two hours or less. Not sure who's more to blame for the way the final product turned out
Hey Chris!!!!  Feeling a bit better these days.  I have several autoimmune diseases and I have missed your videos for a while now from being in the hospital all of the time.  Please send your love to your family and friends from our family to yours.  I truly adore your channel always.  My Mother recently passed away at the age of 101 and she liked your videos too.  Thank you my friend for everything and we cannot wait to see your movie either!!!!  Talk to you later alligator 🐊!!!!  Love Hollis!!!!
actual video starts at 2:09
Guys it's not Marvel is freakin DISNEY! Disney are all about marketing. They ruined Star Wars and Marvel. Unfortunately they will keep doing that just for the damn money!
The MCU is really low quality and plays to the lowest levels of storytelling. They need to stop worrying about agenda driven storytelling and focus on just storytelling, which is what the first phases up to Endgame good.
No one cares get off the internet
I really liked the movie, phase 4 is so boring (except for No Way Home and Ms Marvel), because nothing feels truly special anymore and if it does, it'll end in the same standard Marvel stuff we saw over the last 4 years or so. Thor 4 is weird and way too busy to be jokey and for whatever reason that's why it worked for me. It would be a more consistent and better movie if they would've given it 20 minutes more and cut some gags for real character moments, but Marvel isn't about characters and story anymore, it's about spectacel and hype, so if thex cut character and story from the movies I'm more happy with fun jokes than with the exhaustingly standard Marvel action. I love the work the actors do, Bale and Thompson are so amazing! Especially Bale did a fantastic job, his acting in combination with the vfx was so great and sometimes even spooky. The 20 minutes I wish the film was longer, would be amazing, if we see Gorr actually kill Gods and be the murderous monster, he's supposed to be. I understand the critics, because I see the flaws and if they would've been fixed Love and Thunder would probably be one of the best Marvel movies, but for some reason Marvel, the cutters and maybe even Taika decided against a longer, a little bit more serious version. So I'm happy with this funny and weird movie. I would watch this movie over Shang-Chi, Black Widow, Black Panther or Ant-Man 2.
The MCU is completely losing me in phase 4 I am getting so tired of woke politics and identity politics going into comic book movies. It seems to me that these movies keep on getting worse. In phase 4. Gor was a complete joke.!!! The god butcher killed one god that we see in the whole movie. Why does marvel keep picking characters for shows that we absolutely do not care about. Moon knight was terrible at the end and Ms. Marvel is almost unwatchable and also absolutely no one asked for a she hulk series. Please Marvel stop killing are movies with raced character swaps,and male toxicity, with now only putting in women super heroes. In every movie. I will at least say this though. Loki/ what if/ shang chi I guess/ and spidey/ and parts of strange M.o.m we're good. Does anyone agree that this is happening.? Or am one of the only ones that think this way. Lol. Since phase 4 and Disney and the MCU going woke; their stock has gone from $209 per stock to about 85$. Go woke go broke. Please stop this bleeding Disney and make quality movies like you used too. Ugh, okay I'm done ranting.😱
me and my friend went in with very low expectations and were expecting a good laugh, it was definitely a mess but I enjoyed it. not as good as Ragnarok though
Even ignoring the eye roll diversity moments, the movie just didn't have an arc or overall vision beyond let's have Thor do funny things.  Honestly would've preferred a Gorr The God Butcher standalone instead.
They had two tones and they didn’t complement each other
Christian bale was very under used in this
Pussy film review that.
So I was a little high watching this, but I really enjoyed it. Definitely no Ragnarok, and the jokes fall a little flat at times, but it was a decent movie. Others may have said this, but the beginning with Gorr was really interesting. Worshipping, living, and dying for your god, only to find out he could not care less about your pain and existence. I wish this concept had been explored further, rather than it just being a quick 2 minute explanation as to how Gorr became the god butcher.
It feels like everyone is getting tired of it. I say end it.
Maybe speed up the review. I watched 3 minutes of blah blah before the actual review started.....
Native Portman has been going downhill she was very cringy in the new Thor movie. Idk if it was her lines or how she was just thrown in their but her acting wasn’t great tbh.
It's a SILLY Movie!  Silly!
This movie ruined Thor for me
This movie was too stupid.......That director tried to make it a comedy!
Great review, although a lot of the comedy and story didn't live up according to me. Also, I would also be going to see Top Gun for the 3rd time this weekend !! 🙌🏻
Of course i’m expecting the movie to be funny and plenty of hilarious moments but with Gorr being the villain and with Gorr’s origins i expected the movie to take itself a bit more seriously and thought it was overly comedic and didn’t balance the two tones very well. Like every single thing felt like a joke and i’d like more dark serious moments given the material in the movie and what is going on, and there is such a thing as just beating a dead horse with the comedy and having too much comedy. I was like ALRIGHT already. I don’t need one joke right after another after another after another. And I definitely expected Gorr to have a lot more screentime especially the fact they got christian bale, a phenomenal actor as Gorr. I expected it to be sorta like infinity war in that aspect, where Thanos took up most the screentime and stole the show. I expected that with Gorr. Thought it’d be more focused on him and be more serious because of that and then with hilarious mcu slapstick comedy inbetween those scenes with thor and the guardians. Also the guardians of the galaxy felt pointless. Like why have thor join them in endgame just to have a shortlived montage with them at the beginning of the next thor movie then leave. Thought thor joining the guardians in endgame was building up and leading to something storywise. Thor could have not joined the guardians and it would have made no difference.
You summed up what I thought as well nicely: didn't love or hate it, but wouldn't say I didn't like it either (I did!). It's very enjoyable and it's got a lot of great stuff overall, but nowhere near Ragnarok. I actually do wanna see it again mostly cause I'm curious as to how much it holds up on repeat viewings. The second half saved it for me in spades, honestly.
Frankly I expect so little from Marvel now that I didn't mind the film. I don't think Taika Waititi's heart was in it, so he just figured "screw it let's make a supid superhero movie". Look, Marvel is past the point of being taken seriously, and maybe this will show people that it's time for Disney to stop milking unoriginal cash cows.
has chris stopped giving scores to films?
Why do i think Chris is becoming more diplomatic as he is transitioning towards being a Director.
Bale's performance is what kept me in the theatre. I would have likely walked out otherwise. Even Taika seems to realize how bad it was. As himself is taking jabs at it's terrible editing & bad CGI lol.   Yea Taika way to pass the buck here as you probably signed off on some of that ya putz lol. I give him credit for Ragnarok but Love & Thunder isn't worth anyone's time.   It also creates problems moving foward. As what was the point in any of this. As could gave brought people back much sooner. Thantos had to have known about thus as well.
Being aware my tastes are different.  I enjoyed this movie.  I thought that the humour on the surface allowed them to talk about much more serious themes. In the majority of Superhero movies the status quo is fine and the villain is the one who disrupts the status quo.  In this one, the man of deep faith is shattered when he discovers that the being he had put all of his hope into is indifferent and abusive.  Gorr is an iconoclast destroying these false gods. This movie was religious on levels that will make a lot of people very uncomfortable.  This movie sat with grief the way that the Marvel movies have tended to avoid - even Endgame did not have this rawness with characters chatting in a grief support group.
Yeah, watching the interviews kinda gave me an insight into what may have happened with this movie. Feels like they had a very bare bones script and I'm speculating maybe Taika was a little too confident that they could improvise a lot of it and make it work in the edit. Of course first cuts are very long, but a 4-hour cut for a 2-hour movie seems a bit too much. Besides that, they say the extra material are pretty much all jokes that often sidetracked the story -- which is weird, because the movie already has plenty of that. Not to mention a few big name actors (Peter Dinklage, Jeff Goldblum) that were cut from the movie, including Lena Headey, who apparently (judging from her agents' lawsuit) had a substantial role that's nowhere to be seen.  About the possibility of Marvel changing the way they do things, I was surprised with Kevin Feige saying he wants more directors like Sam Raimi, that he can just let them do their thing and be more hands-off during the process. It's an unusually candid comment from Feige, and I feel like the man is just too tired and overworked. Maybe he felt he could do that with Taika, too. After all, Ragnarok was a big it and the man just won an Oscar for the amazing Jojo Rabbit.
It’s really nice to have my thoughts and feelings about this film said out loud. You described perfectly how I feel about it and that seems to be the same for all the films you review. Very satisfying and I appreciate your empathy for filmmakers.
It was fun and beautiful, but not what i wanted from the characters. It's my second worst MCU movie, mostly because the story they wanted to tell was very serious (don't even mentioning the source material) and supposedly introspective, but they went way too much into the goofy territory to the point I don't like this Thor anymore, because they made him just dumb. Not fish out water dumb, but stupid, irresponsible and most offensivly disrespectful.
I have the same thought Chris, I felt Gorr was SUPER underutilized. It felt like there was so much more that he did that we didn't get to see like killing those other Gods he talked about killing. 70% Gorr was just creeping around and creating those shadow monsters just for the sake of making something for our heroes to fight.
I feel like T:L&T went a little overboard with the humor. Sure, a little is ok, but when the movie stops taking itself and its universe seriously, it takes you out of the film. Like when on New Asgard you can see there's an ice-cream shop called "Infinity conez" with a huge Infinity Gauntlet holding an ice-cream cone for a sign. It's like they forgot Thanos annihilated half the surviving asgardian population after the destruction of their home. It's like they're making fun of their own people's genocide. It doens't sound like something they (or any visitors to New Asgard) would find funny after going through the Blip.
Oh my God love and thunder was The Batman bad it don't get no worse of a statement.. I have never said that: about a Marvel movie till this one!!!
The Critical Drinker was more brutally honest
Put your movie name on your t shirt..
This movie sucked!! 😩😩😩😩😩
This movie is trash
It’s the new Bob era …
The trailer told me everything I needed to know— to not go see it. Marvel seems to really be on the decline.....
I thought that the movie would focus more on Thor's existential crisis. That would be interesting to explore on a character who had lost everything. Didn't really liked the movie but I like the fact that is being so divisive.
I found myself yawning in theater and that's when I realized I didn't like it. I loved Gorr and basically all of his scenes, Russell was good. But there are so many other things that were so meh....they really failed with the whole Gun's and roses and I didn't feel much when it comes to Jane or the kid. Most jokes were misplaced and honestly the VFX are ok, they don't seem weird or super fake but it would have been great that they dedicated more time to the story and what they wanted to achieve.
Movie is hot trash.. no argument needed. It was a parody
Possibly the worst marvel movie for me. The humor was so bad, sometimes cringey, and frequent that it took away from nearly every scene. If i werent with the gf i would have left early. I wanted there to be x-men origin films or something but i say hard pass now.
I really enjoyed this film it’s easily my favourite of the Thor films, Christian Bale was great and I felt it had the right amount of jokes and serious heartfelt moments.
In other words like every critique. You critique movies because you failed becoming a director. Now that you see some pathway. You now moving like you have integrity. So you don't ruin Hollywood connects. This is what's wrong with the world today
Its time that u watch good superhero content like......The Boys
Man you said everything that I had wanted to hear. This is why I love your channel so much :)
They definitely went overboard with the jokes. Even in the serious moments they couldn't stop with the quips and gags. That's what kept the movie from being so much better. That being said, i still liked it.
Shang chi not my cup of tea.. Phase bore after all.
This movie felt like it was geared towards a younger audience. i liked it but i didn't LOVE it.
Unfortunately they ruin a great opportunity to make an amazing movie,I don't understand why they keep making thor dumber every movie 😒
Ragnarok and Love and Thunder have one thing in common then are both doing a parody of thor ..
This guy is very knowledgeable but yo he’s like boring and talks like a robot. No smile or nothing
I've already saw this movie like 3 times with the same actor portraying the same character dumb character:  Men in Black: man is put in his place and obviously, he's stupid, let's laugh at him Ragnarok: man is put in his place and obviously, he's stupid, let's laugh at him Ghostbuster: man is put in his place and obviously, he's stupid, let's laugh at him.  I don't know what's going on but someone has a fetish for humiliation.   I wish nathalie Portman had more things to do than some cliché bs, I actually loved her character but damn, I'll never watch any movie with that Chris, it's getting embrassing at this point. This movie was dogshit.
Top Gun Maverick was phenomenal. Seen it 3 times.
This movie was average at best. Just seemed like a lot of propaganda.
As I mentioned in another review, the problem with phase 4 is consistency. The writing is all over the place, the visuals range from amazing to just awful (including scenes in this film, which I don't thinkit looks that great) and everything feels rushed.   I miss the time of 1 or 2 MCU projects a year, because at least you knew they'd be high quality products, at least visually. I liked Loved & Thunder, but I'm biased because I LOVE Natalia Portman and Christian Bale so much that I decided to ignore the many flaws the film has.
It was fine, they didn't make Thor as big a joke as people are saying, but it definitely was in there.  He got his hero swagger back the last 30 minutes.
It feels like kevin fiege is pointing a gun at chris from behind thhe camera .  Cuz the chris i know  would never like a movie this much rushed.with so many great characters wasted
Just wanted to let everyone know, someone is pretending to be Chris Stuckmann, claiming to be giving away Play Station 5s. Please be careful with scammers on here, I unfortunately got duped out of $100.
How is it "weird" to review and say you disliked a film? Oh, because you want to be a part of the Hollywood scene and don't want to risk offending the wrong people. Common Chris, don't let them change you
Hi Chris. I´ve tried to DM you but could find where to. We are a group of independent filmmakers that met at film school in Miami 20 years ago. We did some amateur stuff in college and afterwards but this is the first film that gets a deal. Was made in a low to no budget of around 20,000 Dollars. It opens today at select theaters and in Itunes, apple tv as other VOD platforms like Microssoft, Prime Video, Youtube, Vimeo, Comcast etc....The name is "Marcus" directed by J.R Poli. If you can review it , it will mean a lot to us. Thanks.
Marvel was cool in the 90’s now it’s gay
Man you are very good is detailing and breaking down movies to it’s core. I find your reviews very helpful in whether or not to see a movie.   I do music and I am a rap songwriter.   Wish there was another Stuckman out there who rates albums haha
This Thor movie feels like it was made by someone who really, REALLY did not want to make a Thor movie. It's almost as if Waititi just hates Thor and made a movie solely dedicated to making him look as dumb as possible.  The coolest stuff (Everything Gorr, even Jane battling cancer) happens off screen.
“For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life. (John 3:16) The bible says the wages of sin is death. Man has broken Gods moral law and has gotten the death penalty. However due to Gods mercy Jesus lived a perfect life and died on the cross for our sins to make us right with God. “Go and sin no more”-Jesus. trust in what Jesus did for you…because He loves you.
I’m not sure I liked this review. Chris, I need to speak to you in the second school after the meeting please.
The previews just looked way too cartoonish and this whole gender situation really irritates the shit out of me. Like they couldn’t leave Thor alone they just had to add a female Thor.  I’m so sick of people manipulating storylines in movie series just to fit some gender equality leave the fucking movies alone.   This could’ve been Chris’s last movie and you guys ruined it in Hollywood.
Made Thor a dumb surfer. Bad movie could ofbeen so good.
Thor: Love and Thunder is so disjointed that not even it's reviews have a proper structure. This was mostly film apologia instead of a proper review.
Stuckmann used to be witty and funny. His hilariousity reviews were a must. But since he got ass r**ed with his "masterpiece" alternative script lines for BvS cough-"Tell that to Zodd's snapped neck"-cough, he never recovered. Turned into this "happy go lucky", NPC, reviewer, saying how much he  understands about the difficulties of scriptwriting and filmmaking, so he respects the art and the effort. It's bullshit to me. All he's doing is bulletproofing himself from criticism for when his movies come out. If you still want a light and honest review m, do to Jeremy Jahns. Respect to him for no selling out through all this years.
Its so good. Apart from the fact that Zeus got destroyed by Thor.
I didn't like it. It was to kid for me... Thor just seemed to dumb. But it's all good my kids liked it.
honestly i think it is really good
My big issue with Thor was the stakes: Gorr's wants to kill all Gods because his god let him down. Ok, cool, we saw that and we know gods in Marvel are a bit flakey, so why do we care? We like Thor and we like Valkyrie but what about the other Gods? We needed to see more of these other Gods. We needed to see the good they could do and why getting rid of some Gods is Bad.  And Gorr's plan was "steal a magic axe to open a magic door so he can meet a space genie who will give him a wish to destroy all gods". What? Why was the magic door asgardian? Why was Eternity locked up? Presumably Odin did this when he was bringing "order" to the universe with Hela but why? Is Eternity in the habit of just handing out wishes, so Odin sealed him away? We needed to _see_ this.  How did Gorr know Eternity will just grant people wishes if they go round his house for tea? Is this common knowledge? His plan was then attack New Asgard and kidnap the children to then lure Thor into the Shadowlands to steal his axe... It didn't seem like that was his plan at that time. It seemed made up on the fly. We needed to _see_ more of this.  Why was the rainbow bridge suddenly in stormbreaker or mjiolnir? The rainbow bridge was operated and controlled by Heimdal who could see through time and space.   I could go on.  There was too much missing from the film for it to be satisfying and ultimately, it just became a comedy popcorn film with an 80s vibe (and I cannot help but feel that Marvel said "We literally want more of Ragnarok please" so Taika and associates ended up doing just that, just replace the emotional beats of Loki with Jane Foster).  What would have been better than shadow monsters would be a cult-like following of former religious folks who began worshipping Gorr as their god which could tie into a greater theme of what it means to be a god. And highlight to Gorr that because a god is worshipped doesn't mean they owe anything to the people who choose to follow them. But maybe that would be too serious for their comedy popcorn film with an 80s vibe.
Yes Top Gun was AMAZING! I'll put it this way anytime I've gone to the movies with my fiance in the last 10 yrs, he's fallen asleep within 15 min BUT this is the 1st time he's stayed awake the ENTIRE film! 🤣
Nice Review. The Thor movie was good in my opinion but it felt like everything moved a little bit fast after the Gorr backstory. Other than that it’s a Marvel movie, I’d still watch it either way.
Super excited about the upcoming movie. cannot wait.
To me the movie felt rushed and some jokes felt cringe.
It's too gimmicky, every other line tries to be a joke. Asgard is now a tourist attraction, moljnir is in a display case and you now no longer have to be worthy to wield it. Its definitely the worst thor film and up there with the worst marvel films.
Movie was MID
I’ve heard this movie described as taika watiti being a bit up his own arse for this one. I’ve not seen the movie yet but it is strange how the trailers I’ve seen have been consistently labelled as misrepresented in every review I’ve read of it.
Long and short of it, Phase 4 feels like it lacks direction.  In the original movies you had this flow of Introduce The Characters -> Build Towards Avengers -> Introduce the next big threat -> Introduce more Characters -> Build towards the conflict with the next big threat -> Climax fighting the next big threat.  After that it seems to be in a phase of Introduce The Characters again.  They need stakes, and they need them fast.
I am embarrassed for Bale, Hemsworth, Portman and Crowe.
Say what needs to be said. Shit. What happened to you!!!
The movie is terrible. Glad it's banned in other countries.
👁👁🆗️
Are you watching Better call saul
Stuckman Reviews suck now. He’s now beholden to, and suckling on, Hollywood’s teat
2:35 this is why you are now a shill
I wasn't a big fan of ragnarok,   but this just looks awful...
just a water down marvel flick for 10 year olds, Disney killed marvel
I believe that you, Chris, are respected because of your honesty and sincerity. - this film was 'not' good. Not having enough time to fully complete it, or realize it, well...ok.  "Mars Attacks" was a fun film, but its Director said the same thing - he was short on time making the film he wanted, pressured to complete it sooner than he wanted by those holding the purse strings.  Marvel, and Disney, are becoming more and more (and more) desperate for 'a hit'.  It's been years since they've had one......  It almost feels like both have been taken over and are being run by children, who don't have a clue. And this movie looks and feels like a bubblegum gay fest. Which is ok, if you like that. Personally, I liked the Marvel films that were a bit more mature, with an occasional well placed humorous quip. Not endless bleating goats.
Taiki watitti is the real God killer.
i'm pretty checked out w marvel these days. overkill is real.
I found almost every aspect of it extremely underwhelming, & found myself periodically bored throughout. Most of the comedy didn't land at all for me, and some jokes that weren't really funny the first time, kept coming back. I was extremely disappointed with how they handled Gorr. Christian Bale was very well cast, but was so underutilized. Gorr's motives made no sense & he really didn't do much the whole film. I'm also getting really tired of Thor just constantly being a moron, and the butt of every joke in his own film. It wasn't funny, it felt very mean-spirited most of the time. Also, also, I despise Korg as a character. He was ok in Ragnarok, but was just so obnoxious in this film. He's just Taika's self-insert character, and it really doesn't work imo.  The Thor 4 Pitch Meetings video pretty closely sums up how I feel about it. Will probably never watch it again.
Phase 4 is hot mess, it feels so directionless. Oh, little poem there 👍
I too also briefly met Taika as well and he seems like a cool guy just loves movies like me and you,
Fuck this woke bullshit.
Don't hate. Be critical. Major difference.
Mr. Stuckmann won't review Jurassic 6. Now I know why...
You barely even spoke about the movie lol
Disappointing review. Chris seemed to dance around this being a terrible movie.
Chris grew up with Paul Allen’s review.
I personally find the Marvel movies kinda shallow at this point, but looking forward to your thoughts on "What is a Woman"
I wish they would have taken the story more seriously. Too much attempted comedy, ruined it for me.
“Im not gonna review movies I don’t like because I’m making films myself” is a really cute way of saying “I’m not gonna give my honest negative opinion on movies so please don’t speak Ill of mind”
This movie is a mess. And I'm sorry but Taika is just a more ADHD version of James Gunn. And I prefer James Gunn so mych more.
Idk if there's another Thor movie in the future but I know Taika can reallly make a movie that pulls at the heart and just not mostly comedy so I hope we can get that next time. I love Thor and I love how he's improved upon the character despite this one not being as good as Ragnarok
Tbh i think it’s clear marvel don’t know what they’re trying to do anymore. Thor already had is arc so this movie really just felt like a straight to video spin off like Aladdin and the king of thieves or something
I liked it and didn't think I would .  Not exactly motion picture high art but a fun diversion from the day to day.
It could have been so much better. The best parts were the comedy. The action was meh and the effects were kinda meh too at times. So many plot holes and nonsensical things happened. You're normally too kind and I'm glad you didn't give it a good review as it was.
more like Love and Blunder.
Please watch RRR....
Fuck me this reveiw sucked, I hated this thor but chris litterally talks about nothing from the film, explains little, talks about what others have talked about to obviously skirt around the fact that this movie sucked dick. Stop being a sell out chris and tell it how it is like you used to.
Have you seen the Anime film Belle Chris?
Bruh u barely talk about the movie...huge fan but thus review is no bueno
You take a break from making your own movies to then turn around and watch more movies? Lol incredible. Cant wait for Shelby Oaks! Im trynna temper my expectations cuz You may be under alot of pressure but Im sure the movie will be satisfying
Wow......I haven't watched you in a long while and you've definitely changed!!  Meaning the way you do reviews.  You should have torn into this movie!
I love Taika Waititi, but it's weird seeing him make fun of his own movie while promoting it. It feels like he's saying he doesn't care about it.
I just started your review and god I hope you don't think it's a good movie.  Because Thor Love and Blunder sucked giant donkey balls!!
This movie problems all started with Ragnarok, with was a very shitty Thor movie, this is just Ragnarok 2: gone wild.
you were way too kind to this movie.  it blew chunks
Chris just become a Disney woke.
Did anyone else notice that eternity looked like galactus? 🤔
I really enjoyed Thor Love & Thunder. It's more of an outright comedy than other Marvel films but it's a very, very funny comedy, so no complaints.
Nice
This movie should have been 2-1/2 hours.. They cut too much out. It felt like a mess a bit. The main story is a bit laughable. Thor has to save children… Pretty boring
Good Movie :)
Great Movie :)
Ayy
Where is the review for The Northman?😭
Just saw it... I laughed my butt off ... plus the moments that were serious were great as well.. I don't understand the critics... reminds me of Star Wars critics... never happy.
I was just disappointed in the movie. It hit me later, they didn't take the movie seriously.
Yeah the press surrounding this movie is so weird plus all of the VFX controversy that just came out idk
I don't know what's worse the movie or this "review" of the movie.
Genuinely don’t understand how anyone has Ragnarok above this movie. Same type of movie, same style of action and humor. The key difference being this one had a stronger script and story. I don’t know if it’s group-think or if it was the novelty of Ragnarok, but that movie did not have an impressive script or story *at all*, it really wasn’t even ambitious from that perspective.
I too thought Ragnarok was one of the very best Marvel films, still is. However, I thought Love and Thunder didn't have that controlled style to it running through the whole film. In fact, I thought there was a sense of style that was missing. Ragnarok had that 80's neo cyber punk vibe going on and so thought Love and Thunder should of applied a worn out VHS 90's thing going on with it's soundtrack better utilized. In this it seemed more like other Marvel films and that the studio itself had more interference. It also felt as if it was 3 films crammed into one. Once again, like so many Marvel films it jumped from key points to key points. There was no time to have scenes linger.
Can someone make a Gorr movie. 🙏 His back story is interesting 😲
This felt like a piss take marvel movie , which is why I found it fun.  whereas with doctor Strange 2 , which was trying to be serious , felt like a fucking mess 😂
Love you Chris but I do miss the brutality honest Chris.
Skipping this one. Can’t stand Portman
Very disappointed in this film. Too silly and unbalanced. Truly one of the worst MCU films to date.
I feel like as far as Phase 4 goes there have been more hits on the TV side than the movies. Spider-Man and Shang Chi are the only really solid bangers out of the bunch, with Dr. Strange: MoM and L&T being entertaining if not flawed, and only really Black widow and Eternals being a little lackluster- even though there are things to like in both of those.   But WandaVison ( minus the finale ), Loki, What IF?, Moon Knight, and Hawkeye were all really good. Ms. Marvel was cute, pretty decent, and FaTWS was the only real clunker with She Hulk looking to be a fun romp on the way.   So if you average all that out Phase 4 actually has had more successes than failures, but ppl seem to much more invested in the movies than the shows, and the focus SHOULD be on the movies in the first place since they supposed to be these epic events, and the shows should mostly act as supplemental material and/or ways to introduce newer lesser known characters.

They destroyed Thor as a charcter. Made him a bumbling idiot. The frequent jokes undermined the movie as a whole. If the movie itself isnt taking itself seriously, then why would the audience. Literally couldnt care at all about any of the characters at this point.
Not every one cares about your movie,but nice plug
Yeah this movie was a bit of a let down…I liked stuff and had fun watching it. But overall just didn’t like it. It’s good. But not great and the marketing has been SUUUPPERRR weird.
This movie is a perfect example that marvel doesn’t care anymore.
A pleasure watching your review as always, but ouch what a burn to this movie "I´m going to watch Maverik now for the third time" while stating that you don´t wanna see Love and Thunder again :D. Cheers from Denmark
Gonna get a Johnny Depp displate
It feels like the directors are over Disney pulling all the strings
Hated Thor L&T as the comedy was way too much and cheesy for me 4.5/10💩💩💩💩
please god ..stop with these movies
Thor has become the clown of the MCU universe, after the horrible movie that Ragnarok was, I refuse to see this one. Marvel needs to get his act together!
My 2 cents is that, Disney has destroyed Marvel, and all this CGI nonsense will make you more braindead. The end.
Don't fret Chris, all the movies these days seem like a let down. I hate to say it being a huge movie buff but it feels like there is a huge cloud of wokeness lurking behind any production brought to the big screen. Except Top Gun: Maverick! It's kicking ass in the theaters because It doesn't give a rats ass and is like the old fun summer movies we used to watch.
awkward cameos of famous actors, Zeus / Russell Crowe played as some drunk guy, god's butcher who killed 1 god on screen. Taika Waititi taking piss at CGI effect crew as it went to public how Disney basically abuses power to crush those poor people...  I think that Gorr, "big bad" has around 7 min of screen time...but we have like 8 scenes with screaming goats...  Imo movie had no idea what they wanted to be. Every single important thing was undercut by joke, and most jokes aren't even that funny, and whole script is lost in those jokes. There is scene where Thor is talking to those children and it's very,very important to deliver message, and you have Valyrie tickiling his nose... Who finds that funny ?  2 year olds? Somebody 10 days ago said it best, this movie feels like it was made by sitting 10- seven years old kids into a room to brainstorm about plot and saying yes to EVERY SINGLE idea that they come up with.  Axe vs hammer- yes sreaming goats from 2008 commercials- yes drunk Crowe- yes cancer plot that is being used as joke- yes gods eating kids- yes kids being human shield-yes again screaming goats- yes /yes /yes black&white screen- yes rainbow screen- yes death played as joke- yes   And after they greenlighted all of this they figured they have no plot
top gun was even better the 2nd time!
At times I felt like I was watching a parody movie. I should know, I grew up on parody movies. I will say that Christian Bale was awesome as always
Chris , are you going to review Stranger Things season 4!?😭
It feels like audiences are tired, as well as the creators. Let's just slow down a bit, Marvel.
The movie is too silly...and, like you said...without a plan. It is not a movie to watch in the theater.
I liked it!! The plot was cool! ❤love. I think Chris Hemsworth is funny.
this wasn't as good as Ragnarok because Ragnarok had Led Zeppelin.
Taika talking shit about the effects in the movie really put me off. I mean, I was not an avid marvel's movie person anyway (only seen about 3-4 of them I think) but it's so mean spirited. Especially after hearing a lot of those hired vfx artists are treated like shit, underpaid and people make changes left and right. Some have shared their experiences on their twitters and so for him to make a joke out of the abusive work environment he was apart of is just nasty to me. What was that video supposed to accomplish idk...he really put his foot in his mouth doing that.
It was a bad movie. Bale was amazing. That's about it.
This Movie felt Rushed.
They made Zeus and Eternity a joke! Eternity? For real? Look him up people....
What I'm concerned about with Marvel is I feel like they're pushing quantity over quality now and it's showing, the runtime for doctor strange and Thor is only around 2 hours and I felt like those movies were rushed and weren't given time to breath, I felt like they could've used more time to actually flesh out more parts of the movies, I think Marvel would actually benefit from holding back a little and only make like 3 or 4 movies and like 3 shows, cause they REALLY went hard with trying to pump out content with all the shows and movies we've been getting and I'd rather have 6 good movies over time rather then 2 out of 10 in half the time, Thor Love and Thunder was a 6/10 for me, it wasn't amazing or good but it wasn't terrible, it was ok but definitely has a lot of flaws, I'd rather watch Top Gun Maverick again over seeing Thor again personally
Save your money. If you like comedy and childlike simplicity then this is for you. (It's Disney folks) Visual Effects, Chris, Bale, Portman are great tho!
Love and Thunder is just a case of you thinking that sweets are wonderful and then decided to eat much more of them, then you realize you got severe diabetes thanks to that then you have no idea how the hell it happened in the first place.
Wow. I never thought I would see you completely sell out. Your disliked reviews are some of your best content. Take care Stuckman you really are a heck of a nice guy I wish you luck but I think it's time to unsubscribe. I know I can't be the only one that's stuck with you for years to feel this way....
I wish they take time with Gorr. I love his presence in the movie. Or may be me just being a bias father relate to his thinking.
My take-away from the reviews has been:  If you want to see a Waititi romantic comedy, you'll probably like the movie  If you want to see a heroic Thor movie, you probably won't like the movie.
It didn't feel like I was watching an epic god movie, I thought I was on a comedy show. Too much fun for my taste. This movie does not represent comic book fans!
So funny you mentioned Ragnorak and Shang-chi; I just watched both again between yesterday and today.  I too loved both those films.
This review was...  Ad Explaining your career Gor was great Thor was great Natalie had something to do Talk about director and the process for 5 mins.
You know who else thinks it is weird to review films as a filmmaker? Nobody.
I wanted gorr to be more evil 😂
Still waiting for Chris to say something I disagree with... still waiting... ok. We're still good. Damnit! It's like he knows what I'm thinking (about films).  On another note... can't friggin' wait to see Shelby Oaks. And oh boy, what a cast! Keith David! Brendan Sexton III! I don't recognize the other names but nonetheless look forward to seeing them in this film.
It's almost like your being Paid by Disney For Damage Control... meh movie
I agree with you that Thor - Ragnarok was great.  I've seen it many times at the theater and own the DVD. Thor - Love and Thunder was a huge disappointment and I won't be buying the DVD until it's at the 'dollar store'. Chris H. was born to be Thor and he was superb.  No gripes with him.  The problems were the story line, childish jokes, poor character development, and directing. If you're in elementary and maybe middle school, this garbage might be appealing. But, anyone else who's capable of critical thinking would see things don't make sense.  From the opening scene of Christian Bale's character being too stupid to find shelter for his daughter and himself. And, given his background and Jane Foster's too, how do they suddenly become such 'Bad Asses'? No learning curve on how to master weapons fighting! Russell Crowe's Zeus was a big, fat joke, with a corny accent, and not to be taken seriously. And, the ending with Gorr's daughter wielding 'Storm-Breaker' was written by a child for a child.
I think the director is scared to release the director cut, cause he know that is a significant better movie than this bad SNL skit that went on too long. I hope the Star Wars fans get him remove from Star Wars before we see them joking about every single thing, with screaming goats. I hated this movie. The threat never felt real at all. Even Jane dying didn't emote anything. Even the kids got tired of goofy Thor. BP2 better knock it out the park. Cause this year Marvels have not been great so far.
The movie wasn't good. I think people are afraid to just say that. It's like the movie was thrown together and made for children 12 and under. A lot of the movie put me in the mindset of those old Sinbad movies mixed with Jumanji and a strong dash of Adventures in Babysitting. Definitely one of the worst movies of MCU. I'm starting to think they know we're going to pay to see the movie because we're so invested and that leads to lack of effort. I promise the negative zone, or whatever it's called, looked like the black and white twilight zone movie with Alfred Hitchcock visual affects.
The first 6 minutes with Gorr was interesting. Then for the next 90 minutes or so, it's mostly written as a Monty Python skit. The entire scene with Zeus felt like I was watching Mel Brooks' History Of The World Part I (1981).
Stranger Things 4 review?
Best thing I heard? That you are going to be watching Top Gun for the third time!! I saw it twice and would love to see it again, but always in the theater. 🤗
Worst movie I've seen in my life.   This pile of shit was worse than Black Widow.
Bizarre plot and character choices so mired down what I thought worked for this movie that the whole thing just fell utterly flat for me. I agree 110% that they underutilized Bale as Gorr so much that he didn't feel like a genuine threat. And...um....are we just going to skim over Russel Crowe's quasi Mario accent (It's a me, a Russel Crowe!). There were gags that I found genuinely funny and really poignant moments, but they were overshadowed by everything needing to be a punchline. I'm still invested in this character, but this one was a dud for me overall. I loved Ragnarok. I'm hoping I'll connect with the next one.
Flub and Blunder.
Chris, I think you can lighten up a little bit.  You didn't have to preface your teensy bit of criticism with "He's a great director" so many times.  Good lord, was waiting for you to get to your point already!
Watch and review "RRR"  Its the most entertaining movie of this year
Nah, this movie is simply really bad. Love the other Thor movies. This one isn't funny and all over the place.
Spoiler warning- This was silly to me ( a non comic book guy who is 54 and does not normally give my two cents or care). If I told you thor was going to give super powers to a gang of ten year olds and one was going to have a stuffed bunny that shoots lazers from its eyes and kills bad guys. Would you believe that was really in the movie? Or that the main badguy would have a change of heart at the end and when standing at an all powerful being (that could have killed half the universe and saved thanos all that work to get all those stones I guess) and instead of wishing all the gods dead as he planned (or wishing everyone he knew back alive, or taking ten minutes to think of a great way to word a great wish) he wishes his daughter back to life and gives her to thor and they are then called "love and thunder" and fight badguys. I shit you not.
I saw No Way Home. It was okay. I guess I'm tired of these average Marvel movies. Oh, and Civil War was garbage.  The best so far was Enter the Spiderverse. Wish that Doc Ock returns!🤔
Honestly... those shirts
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.   We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him.  We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins.   He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.  May God Bless you all! ♥️
This movie was fcked I actually liked it lol
CHRIS! #18 ON TRENDING DUDE!
That's it Marvel, release the Snyder cut.
Just as actors get typecast for certain roles and become synonymous for being "that guy!" in every film they're in, I feel as though Taika Waititi has started to enter this territory with his approach to film-making. It's absolutely fine to have certain trademark elements present throughout your work, but when your entire film is doused in your own special sauce every single time, it can get a little tiresome. For me personally (and just reiterating this is my own opinion, feel free to disagree or change my mind) this film did not land purely because of Taika Waititi's insistence on sticking to his own formula. This film felt so disconnected from the wider MCU that it could exist as a standalone, but even then, it feels more like a Taiki Waititi film than a Marvel Film, and I think there's a critical balance there that needs to be adhered to when you're playing in such a big franchise. Also didn't help that Thor is now as dumb as a doorknob, the VFX seemed rushed and incomplete (Jane Foster's mask honeslty look like a Snapchat AR filter at one point), the story was incoherent and had no real threat in the grand scheme of things, and the resolution was just rushed.   While his other films have been great and I totally respect his creativity overall, sometimes, he needs to dial it back the Waititi a little.
Never understood why was it such a big deal not to call Jane Lady Thor and why is Valkyrie called a king instead of a queen 🤔
Go woke and you go broke I hope Marvel learns… but then again it’s Disney.
i wonder if he liked it, let's see
I hope Shelby Oaks doesn't turn out like incantation
I'm honestly going to say it, films like RRR need your support! A celebration of everything you've loved about filmmaking. Really hoping for a review for this one.
This movie was TRAAAASSSHHHH
I'm unsubscribing, the gender politics have destroyed Marvel and this dude is Stuck giving positive reviews. Oh and you don't watch movies recorded on film, stop calling the digital movies you watch "films".
Movie wasn't good on a marvel stan. Bale was wasted & the movie was almost boring. Marvel are really slipping it's so disappointing I hope it picks up
Phase 4 has been a dumpster fire of missing the mark and adding Disneys woke agenda, i truly sit back and think what Thor L&T & Dr Strange would have been if they weren’t Disney movies but Marvel movies. It’s bad when you can watch a movie and imagine how much more intense a scene/storyline or movie would have been or what the director wanted; and it’s like you can almost see where Disney stopped that from happening and influenced the outcome
We need the over arching villain like Thanos was.  Gorr was amazing and shouldn't have died.  It was a jarring mix of comedy and horror. More horror, less comedy would have been good.
It was wack bcs , Christian bale switch up to marvel . He use to be DC . SMH
The kingdom of the Lord is at hand humble yourselves, renounce the sin that clings so closely & repent and believe in the name of Jesus for the remission of your sins. christ died for us so live for him. His forgiveness is greater than any sin you could ever commit. if you don’t believe give him a try no matter what he will accept you even if you’ve never believed since birth.. confess with your mouth and believe with your heart truly believe and you shall be save it takes nothing but faith Trust Me you will feel him id rather die believing and there not be life after then there be life after and not believing Jesus knew he would be the most hated but despite that still gave up his life for us believe in that and ye shall be saved. the blood of Jesus poured for our sins so you don’t have to go to hell. God can work wonders if you let him just a little of your time. God is there for you   Matthew 18:12 “What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them gets lost, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountain and go in search of the one that is lost?  I tell you, in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance Luke 15:7
I was thoroughly disappointed with the movie
7:12 I’d say it’s a new era of marvel where they stopped trying anymore and just put stuff out there despite the bad writing and bad directors (except Sam raimi, he had to work with a bad script) (and Spider-Man no way home was great.), because they know the fans, media and critics will say good things about the movie anyways and won’t say otherwise. Well they ain’t getting any more money from me.
Your reviews are my favorite, and you’re always spot on! Best of luck to you and your filmmaking!
I understand and how people can be divisive on this one, the jokes can be too much to not let the serious storylines be fleshed out especially with Gorr. But with that being said I still had a blast with this movie, it was a lot of fun.
every scene in thor 4 seems so disjointed
Had a feeling this movie would be a wreck. If they’re being iffy about it in interviews, chances are after having fun with joking around on set and filming the movie, they saw it and even they thought the movie was way too all over the place. I saw it coming from a mike away….
He talked more about the promotional stuff than how he felt about the actual movie....
Very disappointed at the quality.
I love how all these reviewers can't bring themself to say it was terrible.  They know it's bad.   They know why it's crap.  They can list a dozen reasons why it's crap.   But can't say it was hot garbage.  I think only Jeremy jahns has been honest that it's a pos movie without a million excuses as to why
That sucks that you wont make fun of movies anymore.
The promotional material makes sense now. Even they knew it wasn't a good movie.
Stranger things s4 review !!!!!
Movie was meh.. enjoyable  but meh..
I don't get the reluctance to review a movie and talk about things you didn't like about it (if anything at all). That's the entire point of being a movie critic. You talk about the good AND the bad. And you know that.
I definitely definitely concur.
I like this film but yeah something just felt off about it. I wanna say the timing or the pacing felt a bit weird, like there were moments when something happened and you didn't have the time to process it or the tone didn't match the event you just witnessed. Then the movie jerks you in another direction right after that. Definitely felt like scenes were removed or replaced or maybe the plan changed part way through the making of the story. Also things that are revealed in this movie that should be significant to the rest of the MCU Universe, or the story telling of it anyway, just kinda fell short and felt hollow.
Living your dream! And then ya gotta watch Thor lol
Im still waiting on your spoiler review of The Scarlet Witch ft Dr. Strange
Banned in China..................... seems like every other film.
Nowhere near as good as Ragnarok doesn’t mean anything to me but each to their own. The only thing I can say is I liked Thor Ragnarok as a parody that one time but will never watch it again. As for Love and Thunder… is something that it's not even worth discussing in my opinion.   Thank you for taking time to do the video. I wish the best on your movie! Looking forward to it.
Thanks Chris, another great review.
It was entertaining and a bit too silly but I had a decent time with it
The problem with Taika is that he doesn’t take anything seriously, at least not where Thor’s concerned. Even in Jojo Rabbit, there are great emotional scenes, but he also treats most of the characters like they’re from a cartoon.
dude review jurassic world dominion lmao
Dude, when I saw this video I actually had the thought "Chris is right in the middle of the edit.  That means he's seen a rough cut.  I hope he made it through ok."  And then you said it!  The Scorsese quote is such a timelessly useful one to filmmakers because A) it's 100% true, and B) it comes from one of the greatest directors of all time, so there's some relief that if even he has felt that way about some of the greatest films he's made, then a rough cut isn't as hopeless as it seems.  Raw diamonds just look like dull glass until they've been cut and polished too.
I have a pretty good reason as to why this movie felt so different compared to what the trailers promised us AND why Taika Waititi and Christian Bale openly talked about being stripped of a good amount of their creative power: Bob Chapek. The new CEO of Disney, Bob Chapek, who’s been in power for a while now has openly expressed and proved that his philosophy is to remove the leadership from the creators and give it to his shareholders and fellow businessmen. This has been proven time and time again since Disney’s stock has been rising; but the quality of their movies and shows have felt clearly lacking compared to when Bob Iger was the CEO. That’s because Iger’s philosophy was to let the creators lead instead of shareholders and businessmen. Even when Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness came out, Kevin Feige has been very critical of the fact that he no longer has complete control over the films, shows and marketing anymore. For example: Feige never wanted the trailers for Doctor Strange to show too much of the Illuminati, but within a week of the film’s release, the trailers started to openly spoil who was on the Illuminati. Since then, much of the power now lies with Chapek, who is clearly nowhere near as passionate about the film studios as much as Feige. Look at the Disney Plus shows as well; 6 episode programs ranging from 30 to 45 minutes. That’s not enough for creators to do what they truly can to make great storytelling content, but because it’s cheaper to make, Chapek greenlit the structure anyway. This isn’t even a theory, this is a fact that I don’t think enough people know about. Want to know why Disney with Marvel and Star Wars has felt sorely lacking recently? Look at none other than Bob Chapek.
Omg, I just got stukmanized!!!
I really liked the movie. I Definitely liked it more than Doctor Strange 2.
No more bad films!!!! Noooo!!! So no more Hilariousity reviews?! Please say it ain't so!
I miss when Stuckmann would call people out for making crap movies.  I guess you can't be both a critic and a film maker.
Hi Chris totally unrelated,  did you watch Belle?
Thor 1 is still the best Thor movie
🤮 why would u get one for that horrible movie love and thunder I only get worthy movies
Every review since you started filming: (ad) I won’t say I don’t hate it and I won’t I say I don’t like it but it’s ok
Huge fan of yours, you and Jeremy Jahns are the only reviewers I’ve trusted for years. Finding out you’re a fellow ex-JW was icing on the cake.   But this review felt insincere. I’ve pretty much agreed with your reviews on every single film since I started watching them years ago. So I have a strong suspicion you were secretly very disappointed with this movie as I was. I hope your future reviews aren’t so superficial.  Thor is my favorite avenger and I have no problem saying this was a horrible movie with bad writing, subpar visuals, backwards character regression and cringey humor.
Chris Hemsworth the perfect actor to bring in another era of macho man mpvies
Can you review stranger things?
There is so many issues with this film but for me this was like watching Roadrunner without the Coyote Thor is a double act he needs Loki . I know he's dead in this timeline and maybe there wouldn't be a role for him in this story but it's that chemistry that I missed.
Finally a new fkn video
Point 1: *Love and Thunder invokes Mixed Feelings but is overall a positive experience* Point 2: *Watch Top Gun again because one time isn't enough.* Welp, I know which one I'm spending time on this weekend.
This doesn't say much to me, Because I hated Ragnoroc. I liked 1 & 2.
Will you be giving your thoughts on Elvis?
This is only in theaters right?
Ragnorak is so overrated. Love and Thunder is better
BEST SHURT EVER
I’ve noticed you’re not making a critic video as much as usual. I aware that you’re probably busy with your first film that you’re working on. But yet you chose to critic this garbage MCU film? Anyway, so basically you’re afraid to criticize a film just because you’re a film maker now? I get it. I was an artist and worked in animation industry, and many of us afraid to say anything negative about animated film because we were in it. But you started as a film critic and I remember you were quite honest. That’s why I’ve been watching your channel. These days….not so much.
RIP Stan Lee
The worst movie ever
I disagree with you big time Chris,  a movie as any other piece of art HAVE TO be criticise and sometimes those critics are positive sometimes are negative, sometimes is deserved sometimes not, what's the point to see a critic when I know you will always think is good? it's a bit pointless, not trying to be rude or anything I've been subscribe to your channel for about 7 years, just my 2 cents
Nerdrotic makes fun of you - it's the difference between ice cream and milk
Valkyrie was a job. Not a title, not a name... a job. "You're a Valkyrie!" - Thor
I mean the reason the last six or so newer movies are so unfulfilling and empty feeling is we don't have a big bad or avengers film to lead them into. All these singular entries won't really blend together well. Marvel is a huge universe so that's why I don't think post Thanos/endgame things will be as neatly fulfilled like before.
So, you're only going to talk about movies you like now?  You will destroy your YT channel if you take this road, Chris.
Problem with this review: Chris is friends with Taika Waititi and is afraid to say anything negative.
Oh man.. Mr. Stuckman. A third of this review dwells on your production of Shady ..Oaks? Geez. Let that stand on its own. I understand your platform, but shoving it in my face? You built a platform, gfu..fuk..its separate from this. A balance is needed in your delivery IMO. Stay true to your roots. If your product is good enough, it will promote itself.
like Chris said "we sacrificed the story for some jokes"  .
I loved this movie, with the right expectations. It was a good comedy.
We watched two different movies. There is no way that this movie was made for adults. This is a kids film
Chris I trust your opinion on movies, so I will go see it
I think the reason the movie didn't feel as good as Ragnarok, but feels similar is because it felt like Disney hands were on this one a bit more.  The scene with the kids, the goats, and one other scene just felt really Disney rather than Marvel.
I dont like thor, but what they did to his character is unforgivable. He is a character that lost everything, his brother,parents, his eye and hammer, his best friends and his kingdom then they turn him into a joke. They might as well have him sucking on his hammer for two hours.
He doesn't want to criticize the movie cuz he knows his is garbage 😂😂😂 He's trying to save face 😂
As a huge gorr fan- very disappointed. Legit made him so weak and got his ass kicked by mjolnir are u kidding me. In the comics fought three Thor variants and Odin force. This is so sad
When did Eternity become a wish granter?
I recently lost a son ( who's name was Axel btw 😢) so while i was watching this movie I sat there feeling all my grief along with Gorr but then the rest of the movie kept taking me out of that space and almost made me feel bad that i was going through feelings and emotions that are clearly meant to be felt when you watch a movie with such a big focus on grief. It needed to stay in those moments a bit longer because the way they played it felt like a parody of thor.
Marketing wise they tried to say as less about the movie as humanly possible
Love and Thunder is a terrible movie.
So now that you’re a film maker you’re too afraid to be critical of movies? Am I hearing that right?
It's like he lost his ability to criticize other films now that he knows he will soon be subjected to it. After all those hilariocities, he finally has respect for the process. If only the filmmakers you criticized had that opportunity huh?
I really don't like the way Chris's reviews have changed over time. I understand somewhat why he's doing this but it just feels like the reviews are hollow and holding back actual honesty. Disappointing.
bro its ok to say a movie is trash. This movie was dookie. I feel like you are afraid to criticize a movie now just because you are making one.
It’s cool now that Chris is in the industry getting a new perspective on movies through that lens.
Hype train to 2M subs!!! Sub now if you haven't already!
3.5 out of 10. Overall flop to me. Especially for the all of the talent they had.
It's almost distracting how buff Chris Hemsworth is now. Like he's hot, but he's so obviously bigger than everyone else in the movies now haha
I can't be the only one... but I really wanna see your review for jurassic world dominion 😂
The movie is not bad its just way too much of a comedy, in fact I would say if you watch with no sound this could pass for a silly musical. Clown Thor is becoming a turn off for even minor fans of Thor who only see him now as a joke or the court jester of the MCU.
I didn’t dislike this movie as much as I thought I would 😅
Why is everybody giving this movie so much grief. It's got an 80% Audience Approval rating on rotten tomatoes so clearly it's not THAT bad.
The first movie I completely disagree with you. I think it is really bad with horrible dialogues and flat jokes, mixed with a bit of en vogue woke trash. Only Christian Bale was worth it for me.
Why is everybody giving this movie so much grief. It's got an 80% Audience Approval rating on rotten tomatoes so clearly it's not THAT bad.
Why try to do Gorr "The God Butcher" and not even show him killing gods...they should've tried to follow the comic more. This movies was horrible...too much unnecessary jokes
When will these comic book studios understand not every superhero storyline has to involved a love story smh
I've had the same feeling for most of phase 4 movies, fun to watch in theaters but ultimately forgettable afterwards.
Wtf happened to Marvel, 2 misses in a row now.
For me Taika is an "old" guy trying to be edgy. It's annoying and disrespectful to fellow artists. I hated his comments about the Thor CGI and the unnecessary shade towards Zack Snyder's JL
Every movie except for the two best reviewed ones (NWH and Chang Chi) specifically deals with the events that happened in Endgame. It's like they are a response to Avengers Endgame which may be why, it feels like they have no Plan. I mean Thor is let us say, in between places. Hanging out with the Guardians while also meditating and trying to deal with his personal issues. I think Ragnarøk worked so well, because Thor himself didn't feel lost. He had a purpose serving his father and protecting the 7 realms. I had the same feeling of being lost in Doctor Strange, Spiderman Far From Home and Loki. Now I know the movie should've been longer, showcasing a bit more of The God Butchers powers, because I believe we haven't seen his true potential. Not to mention his very well, interesting and dark, kind of spooky written character. For whatever it's worth, I don't understand the critics and I stand by the fact that it has been a really good Thor and Marvel movie which entertained me in many ways, to the fullest.
Your reviews are always the best man. Just an honest viewpoint without any agenda. Good luck in your endeavors, but I wish you were still reviewing full time.
MCU is basically "Michael Baying" its fans now. Its garbage. But you'll gonna watch it anyway..
My theory is that this Thor is a skull. He is a little sillier than before and this Thor has two matching eyes. Last time we saw him he had a fake eye. Secret invasion is coming.
Worst Marvel movie ever and who gives a fuck of zeus casting hercules in the end? Loool
It seems like the MCU is doing too much in too little time. Its very noticeable in their TV series as well. The quality of their movies and shows recently have dropped considerably
feels like this was also a really traumatic production in places too, especially considering the hell it must have been through during covid. The amount of studio interference to try and disneyfie it as much as possible seems to have considerably backfired this time  It’s like all the brilliance of the mcu has slowly been sapped out ever since the debut of phase 4 and it’s slowly been getting worse, though I really look forward to seeing Thor 4, feel it’s the last straw now for the mcu.
I can’t believe we’re actually discussing this garbage. What happened to our movies today. Can’t escape the woke mob even with comic book characters
Call it how it is in a respectful way this is what caused will smith getting a standing ovation same night as slapping Chris Rock. Agree with stuckmann it is surprising to see the cast interviews but I think is a good thing.... Refreshing.
There were three major elements to this movie; Thor's self discovery,  Jane's battle with cancer and Gor's faith. Taika undermined all three with his excessive use of skit comedy. It's a shame because Gor could have been an incredible and empathetic villian.
Thank you for standing up for the SFX artists. The marvel machine is pumping out material I’m worried the artist’s final product is suffering when they don’t have the time to perfect it.
Omg dude we get it you’re making a movie. You know what else you’re making? You’re making me never want to see your movie
Marvel quit caring after Endgame.
Chris I love your humility and gentleness when it comes to the movies you review. That being said, healthy criticism is 100% okay!! Speak your mind man.
The old intro was wayyyy better bro
I've been saying it from the beginning of marvel movies. It will go to shit. Just like the comics did.
What happened to Chris' face?
Phase 4 as a whole kinda feels like Marvel's resting on their laurels and just throwing stuff out like "Ehh, people will watch whatever cause we're Marvel Studios".  With that said I was disappointed in Love & Thunder too.  Had some good moments and the film had great potential but was squandered in my opinion.
Just because you like the director doesn’t mean you cant critique his films. Movie was garbage and you know it.
Everything I saw, I loved: The Guardians, Natalie as Mighty Thor, Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie,  Gorr... I just wanted to see more of it. Also we were promised a Queen for Valkyrie's King of Asgard and we got nothing.
That is a glorious shirt
POV: you watch it anyway
Hmm I think the multiverse is a cool idea but at the end killed the franchise... Nothing that happens really matters anymore.
For me it was too much comedy, not enough Gorr and is too short. Some jokes land and some didn't but still a good movie
Best shirt you’ve worn!
If I didnt pay for the movie, I would have been okay with it. The best part of the movie was that I was able to enjoy some popcorn for the first time in a year.
What's really messed up is the director gets all the praise if a movie does well. But, he also gets all the shit if it doesn't come out good either.   But, everyone forgets that there's story writers, screenplay writers, and a lot of times the movie editor (who puts the movie together after all the scenes are done) tht can cut and paste shit how they want without the director ever seeing the finished product.   Dunno who cut out Bale's scenes, but thats the kind of shit they do to fit whatever runtime the studio is demanding. Who cares if it hurts the movie's quality, right?
I enjoyed it but view it on the same level as Shazam.
So... I guess I should go ahead and watch TOP GUN. 👍 Thanks Chris! Hahaha
The comedy in this film was painful. It was too forced and too present too much of the time.
My main criticism is Thor is the new joke.
I’ve heard that Disney mandated it to be 2 hours long, no more and that whole scenes with Jeff Goldbloom and Lena Heady were cut.  It doesn’t seem like Watiti was able to do what he wanted.
Dannnng #19 on Trending
What an incredibly obnoxiously long ad at the beginning
It felt so weird because I didn't hate this film at all. Watching it I enjoyed it but I wasn't overly thrilled about anything. Like it was kinda just like a film of things happening to be honest. I sorta watched it in the same way I would watch a generic Rock movie.
I just know we could have got an awesome Hilariosity out of this movie.
I hope Chris reviews Elvis.
Hot take…. Top Gun remake was … okay I guess. Spectacular jet scenes, but it felt way more like the cheesy 80s original than so many people are letting on.
It was a great movie, if only the villain wasn’t gorr it would been so much better. Just the idea villain being gorr ‘the god butcher’ gives too much certain expectancy that it ruins the experience.
Listening to your take on the marketing of this and how that illuminated the technical problems with the movie, I have to wonder if this is all deliberate. This is just a crackpot theory on my part, but, BUT what if all this weirdness happening in the press and the polarized opinions on this and MoM are all part and parcel of a bigger plan with Phase Four to really tear things apart, dump themselves into chaos, in order to claw back up and out to victory again. So far in P4 we don't have a real grasp on what the Endgame (pun intended) is. Everyone is still reeling from the snap, the multiverse is revealing itself and reality is... malleable? So, IRL, we get movies that stray from the Marvel look and feel. Filmmakers with a unique style are let loose and not reined in so that continuity is preserved. And that causes confusion, questions, polarization, etc. etc. The uncertainty within the MCU is bleeding into the real world. Hmm? Maybe?   Really though, I liked it a lot, but wanted more Gorr, more Mighty Thor, and more King Valkyrie. Also wanted more screaming goats. Also can we get an The Office-like New Asgard Disney+ series please?
So disappointed in this film.  I like Taika, but this was the 2nd worst MCU film after Eternals imo.  Taika can't just help himself with reigning in the humor, and this veered into camp for me.  Also he was busy with directing Mandalorian, Jojo Rabbit, acting in several films and in the background the next Star Wars film.  He spread himself far too thin imo.
i loved it. had an irreverance that i really appreciated... reminded me of the last jedi in a way... i can understand why some hardcore fans would be put off but in a vacuum i think it was a very good very enjoyable flick
Nobody cares about your films. just FYI
This movie did feel pretty aimless.  I don't think Thor really got a character arc through the movie, despite Starlord giving him the advice to "find himself".  He's basically a roaming vigilante at the start of the movie and he is a roaming vigilante at the end.
So you aren't really a film critic now?
Im not confused at all about that FX comment.  A Marvel VFX artist publicly quit. Taika comments looked like a slap in the face, you know. Talking shit about the VFX guys
Will you be reviewing Jurassic World Dominion or Matrix Resurrections?
I’m sorry but this was an extremely boring and bad MOVIE review. Chris hedged any criticism, then went on and on about  post movie commentary and other movie related stuff while barely talking about the movie in itself. Very bland actual movie opinions, not what I expect out of Chris.
Rather you enjoy a movie or not is kinda irrelevant to me. I just come for you honest opinion on films. Good bad or ugly I like your opinion.
Sweet shirt Chris!
thor sucked.  and stop giving tom cruise money so he can fuel his cult.
Taika Waititi is very Kiwi. The sarcastic humour and delivery is taken as serious comments. I’ve seen a lot of YouTube critics talking about the interviews and clearly this has gone over their heads.
Screenplay was bad. So little happened in this movie.  *spoilers*  Thor fighting in space. Thor at to Earth. Thor at Omnipotent city. Thor going to Gorr's place. Thor back to Earth again. Thor teleporting to Gorr's place.  It was padded out by jokes. It really felt they got around too easily. In Ragnarok, they had a hard time getting places. Here they practically just rolled up to the big bad guy's place.
It was ok but the jokes got to be to much. They seemed to take away from what could have been a great story. I hope they reconsider the direction they are going with this director.
This movie was corny poop.
Have you watched the new Anime movie last year titled Belle?
I didn't like Ragnarok. So I won't see this one. And man, even Chris Hemsworth said in a Collider interview "The story was sacrified for jokes". When this is good?
Terrible what's been done to Thor...whatever pushes the message I guess. I've pretty much written off anything Disney do these days.
Hey Chris. Sorry for being off topic, but have you seen Stranger Things 4? If so, are you gonna review it at some point?
The movie was a dissapointing and a huge joke for a thor movie
I think the best change the movie could have made would have been to mature Thor. And part of his maturation is to give his power away. They alluded to him having the power of Odin in giving and removing the power of Thor. He should have easily lost to Gorr. But by giving his power to others he can create an Asgardian army that serves him because he is the center of the power. Something like winning together as a people instead of a single God. And get rid of the Love girl. No need for her. Keep Gorr brutal and menacing.
I missed Jeff Goldblum, there, I've said it.
Northman review please
I feel like the issues I had with Shang Chi get worse and worse with each movie. After MoM I’m just not interested in any marvel movies. I will see Top Gun for a 4th time and wait for Thor on Disney +
So happy to see a review from you again!
I wished it showed Gor butchering gods.
I went in with VERY low expectations and so I liked it more than most people who watched it on opening night. That being said, all the issues are absolutely there and very prevalent, but the third act was overall pretty nice.  Also I wish you’d make a video about The Northman 😔
That Taika Waititi interview and all the interviews I’ve seen leading up to this release really made me dislike him
what aren't you giving a rating anymore
Let’s not forget this is a movie with hundreds of millions of dollars pumped into it. I can’t believe people are making excuses for this shitshow of a movie.  It’s clear the problems weren’t with the budget, but with the creative decisions that could have been solved with little money.
My favorite part is when Gorr swings his sword to Zeus, who says "Gorr it's you, you're Gorr the God Butcher". Truly one of the movies of all time.
They destroyed Thor, I can't believe people like this stupid joker version of Thor over the Shakespeare like Thor of the first one,the only honest thing about this is Chris Hemsworth's body,  and Nathalie Portman's arms are CGI, I didn't believe for a second it was her real arms and people keep praising her "transformation ".
This movie had 5 good minutes in the beginning, after that everything was a disaster... MCU went off cliff after end game. Woke and shit too...
I enjoyed the movie a lot, even if I agree with some issues of the movie like comedy was a bit too much sometimes, a shifting tones, I really had a good time, the story of jane made me care of her, her decisions made sense and didn't disrespect the viewer saying explicitly their thoughts, gorr was a good villain  Even if the internet wants me to feel bad about it, I'm all about more author control over movies than public, since the last feel they were made in very controled enviroment  Nothing new, but people duality of loving or hating everything seems so dumb. With this one I'm more in a grey area turning more into a good experience
Should have been better
You are too insecure and in your own head when you won’t give a proper movie review because you are attempting to create your own movies.
According to several Reddit posts, Marvel are AWFUL customers to VFX houses, always asking for a half dozen half-assed versions of a scene rather than two or three really well done versions and always asking for re-edits up to the deadline...
What this movie did was prove Taika Waititi needs overisght: his ego is so out of control he puts himself in the film as much as the protagonist, he writes the script with a screenwriter who has only a few things to her name and most definitely allowed his children to influence the storytelling: funny goats, kids having Thor's powers, lingering unfunny jokes overstaying their welcome. He clearly hates Thor, is over Valkyrie, loathes any of the lore or world that came before it, like Sif and Endgame and even mocks it on New Asgard and wastes talent such as Bale and Portman. FAIL.
Not true about displate. I have received multiple low res pics etc however they are good about returns. Also the magnets don't always hold very well.
This movie was average at best. Definitely one of the worst mcu films. Btw I miss the days when Chris would give an honest review of a movie. Just because you’ve experienced that side of the business doesn’t mean you still can’t be critical of a film. There were plenty of flaws in this movie.
This movie single handily ruined both Thor and marvel for me.
"You always know the best way to direct your movie, after youve directed youre movie", absolutely . Thats probably the most frustrating thing about making short films imo. I do as much pre-pro as possible, but there are still things I miss until I see the rough for the 1st time. Also your quote about always wanting more time is spot on. Never enough time for filmmaking imo.Cheers
"you build 1 tree"
I have the same shirt!
Wow! Chris that’s is a insanely cool shirt! Where did you find it?!?!?!?!
Bro, bring your grading and normal reviews back. This is bull sh t bruh. You are already more robotic in recent years, and now you take away grades? Dude what are you doing to your channel? Just because you make movies now, you can't have an opinion on other people's movies? Makes no sense.
I've never seen Jojo Rabbit but I know it's not for me because what kind of tasteless a-hole makes a comedy about Hitler? Taika Waititi, that's who. He's not difficult to read because he's a manic genius, he's difficult to read because he's a demented dummkopf. Elevating him in your mind can only lead to disappointment.  Ragnarok: They gave him $180 million and a finished script with a set path. He crayoned the coloring book with zany and it luckily worked. It worked *despite* him: "OMG. A hammer pulled you off?"  But also I blame Hemsworth for this worthless take on Thor. Marvel gave him total freedom and he decided Thor should go from likeable bonehead to unlikeable buffoon. That hurts because I cared about that character. Really, really disappointing.
Chris has been indoctrinated into the Hollywood illuminati now. He won’t give his honest opinion now :((
not reviewing movies u dont like just because ur making a movie shows not only a lack of confidence in your film, but it shows how little you understand the audience who loves your youtube content. perhaps you dont even care about us, because if your willing to change your content in favor of a movie your making, it shows your priority and look, i get it, you dont feel like its right to judge movies when you are making a movie, but....dude. just do your best on your film and if it turns out bad, just be honest about it and admit its flaws. people will respect that alot. i just think your taking it far too seriously. alot of the reason i came ot your channel was to see u shit on horrible movies that had no right to be so bad.
"I don't review movies i think are bad, because i am making a movie now and i can't take criticism" Dude you got famous for your honest, good reviews not this watered down version. Be yourself no matter if you are making a movie or not... People are attracted to the REAL
Apparently Feige has lost a lot of his sign off and oversight under the new Chapek management structure.
Black Phone > Thor: Bore & Blunder
Weird part, its basically like Ragnarok.   All the problems you brought up with this movie is the same that I had with Ragnarok.
This movie was entertaining but it wasn’t very engaging.   I found the humor fell flat. I think Natalie and Tessa aren’t as able to carry comedy as well. They tended to be more of the straight man in the past movies where everyone else around them was more zany.
i miss when Chris didn't hold back and was brutally honest when he didn't like something - now it just feels like he is phoning in every review.
We need a review of “RRR”!
This movie seemed targeted at a younger audience, I was left wanting more, even if they did a part 2 it would of made things a lot better, not so rushed, the goats were cool.
Not sure how people are still going to try and shit on MOM when this dumpsterfire got released
This movie gave me a new found appreciation for Thor: The Dark World.
I think I'd only want another movie from this team if they make it more structured, you know, have a plan. I've seen in another video Taika and Hemsworth say "We sacrificed story for comedy" and that they had a four hour first cut, but because so many scenes were just to be funny, they were cut to make a more cohesive film. So if Taika can reign his comedy in, I'd be for it, or have someone step in to give the film more direction and let Taika do some comedy bits.
Review starts at 2:10 every thing before is a bunch of nonsense
The highlight of the movie is Thor's ass, I was here for that...the rest was okay. If you can get past the first 15 minutes of the movie you're golden!
Terrible film I was completely let down by it
Shaun Chi was THE worst Marvel film period. It made Captain Marvel look like an Oscar winner. The only movie I would have left if I hadn’t fell asleep.
I'd honestly put "Love and Thunder" after "Ragnarök" and the original film. Just a preference, I'm not sure I want to watch this one again.
I wonder if you avoiding films you don't like means you didn't like The Northman
Christian Bale was the only good part about the movie. And he barely got enough screen time.  The opening scene gave me the false hope that maybe this movie would take itself seriously.
Chris, the way u critique movies lately is very bland.. almost like a summary filled with thoughts here and there.. go straight to the point.. the movie was garbage, u know it, i know it, the box office knows it, heck, the director himself stated so when he was interviewed on vanity fair!!.. its harsh to dump on a fellow creators work but garbage is garbage and if u aren't willing to tell us if the movie is bad or good.. then what are u doing
Visually dazzling???? HUHHHH DID YOU NOT SEE THE CGI 😭😭😭
Drinker did this better
My opinion is that the mcu is trying to hard to be more comic book like. Most of the movies that hooked me were more realistic in filming . Not just all about magic ,Not all comical and had a fairly deep story. The new shows with a few exceptions and movies go a bit to far with this. Guardians was the funny one and now it's all trying to be funny.
Let's just say it. IT'S HOT GARBAGE!
Man, what happened to the MCU? Did they really think they could just coast off reputation after endgame? Were the Russo brothers the ones holding things together throughout phase 3?
Haha, I wached Top Gun four times already and looking forward to my fifth time! I'm not even a fan of Tom Cruise😂😂😂
No one steps on an emotional moment Like Taika.   It hit me in Ragnarok when he HIMSELF as Korg, stepped on the most emotionally heavy moment of the movie by cracking a joke over the rubble of Asgard.   That’s pretty much what I expect of him now and it’s pretty accurate.
It was like a throw-away Thor movie. An SNL parody film.  Aside from the low-brow jokes and seemingly being a spoof of Thor movies, the plot was dumb. Plain dumb. Gorr needed Stormbreaker to open the gate to Eternity... Who they made into a wishing well, as opposed to one of three or four most powerful beings in existence. So, if the Rainbow Bridge can open the gate to Eternity, then the Norse gods should have a huge standing in Omnipotence City. They had a wishing well at their disposal. They had the machine that created the Rainbow Bridge, they had a god who could create it and now Thor has an axe that can make it. After Thanos wiped half the Universe, why not just go to Eternity and make a wish to bring them back? I thought Zeus' lightning bolt would be the key since they act like it's more powerful than anything they have. Turns out, it was the most useless weapon that was there. This was written so poorly in every detail. The dialogue, the low-brow humor (making it feel like a parody film like Scary Movie), the plot, the joke placement. Basically everything. This thing was a mess and it seems like, that's what they were going for. A chaotic mess.
It went woke
I used to love your videos but now it just seems you’re afraid to be critical of any films just because you’re making a film? Doesn’t make sense to me, stay true to your roots.
bra stop selling craaaaaap
I enjoyed the uniqueness of this film but the story was superficial. Some funny parts but around 60% of the comedy didn’t work for me. Goats were annoying. Thor’s suit was great though
Been watching the MCU since the original Iron Man in 2008. Seen every single MCU movie in the theater. Also watched Wandavision, Falcon and the Winter Soldier, and some of Loki (couldn't stand female Loki, such an annoying personality). But I gotta say that since Endgame the MCU has seemed aimless. While Spider-Man No Way Home was awesome for sure, and Shang-Chi was good, Black Widow seemed too late to the party for it to really matter, The Eternals was awful, and both Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness and Thor Love and Thunder were disappointing to say the least. But even for the recent good movies in the MCU it just seems like it's completely aimless now. In Phases 1-3 they were building up to a couple different things the biggest of which was Thanos and the Infinity Gems, and to a lesser extent the Avengers initiative. Now, there doesn't seem to be anything noteworthy going on behind the scenes. The extra scene of Shang-Chi was interesting regarding the origin of the rings, and Spider-Man's ending was also interesting, that no one knew who Peter was, but other than that nothing else has been interesting to me. I really thought they'd bring in another character for the new big bad like Dr. Doom or something, but that hasn't materialized yet. I just don't know where they're going, and that's a BIG problem. Phases 1-3 were exciting precisely because you had an idea of where they were headed. Now, who knows. And because of that the MCU is dragging hard for me, and I'm not sure if I'm going to stay interested in seeing the latest MCU movie unless they do something soon. Just being honest.
Review Moonlight.
I watched Ragnarök right before going to L&T & it oddly enhanced how much I enjoyed it but not enough? I felt as you did that something was a bit of a miss but still enjoyed myself. I felt parts were better than the whole though & this new phase of the MCU doesn't have a clear enough plan so everything is a "throw away" & not part of any bigger picture. Tessa as  Valkyrie is still my stand out & easily favorite part.
I can't stand the simpleton humor sense of Taika Waititi (Please apologize if this sounds bad but American humor is not very well understood outside of the US). Bad Jokes or good jokes repeated ad nauseaum (Stormbreaker is jealous, yeah we get it.) I didn't think Ragnarok was good but everyone seemed to like it and I was like yeah, maybe I didn't get it but this movei just confirm I was not totally wrong.
Taika is awesome.. but I hope he doesn't go full Snyder.  Edit: I also think Disney+ is oversaturating us with MCU content. It doesn't feel so special anymore and the tentpole movie experience for the Marvel movies are quite diminished.
Such a shame that they made Gorr, played by Christian Bale, a one movie villain who didn't butcher anyone. Gorr is one of the coolest and most formidable bad guys Marvel has created in decades and he gets minimal screen time with no continuing story. I'll probably never watch this movie again. 4/10
Where is the movie review....>50% of this video has nothing to do with movie review
Phase 4 is baddddd
👍🏻
Man, I think Ragnarok was the worst one.  It was too campy and they turned hulk into a surfer douche
Disney+ it is……….it’s nice to save some money 💰 😉
The ending should’ve had a big battle with Gorr taking out a lot of the gods in the god planet Zeus was in. I just feel like they didn’t make Gorr seem like a huge threat I never felt worried for Thor at all.
Childish humour was intolerable. Not funny after the first time.   P.s JoJo rabbit is overrated
To me it was apparent that the original cut was way longer (which we now know it was). The plot felt incredibly rushed and at certain times it felt very clear that Gorr in particular was meant to be featured much more throughout. Ragnarok struck a perfect balance between comedy and drama, and while I really enjoyed the dynamic and story of Jane and Thor, the movie as a whole was far too comedic for my tastes. Over all a decently pleasurable, but simultaneously disappointing experience.
Give it a month or two and this movie gonna go down as the worst of the Thor movies - yes, even worse than the dreaded second one.
Thor had no purpose that's what this movie was he's searching for a purpose lost his parents his brother his world his eye his sister he killed and all he has left is Jane dying from cancer what's his purpose no by frost no Asgard he killed Thanos now what.  That was me in 2003 I lost my mom my girlfriend my job my house my car I was like what am I here for!  Like Thor I got on a ship and adventure it was grayhound for me. I landed in the south changing rules fighting greedy corporations racist cop's the voting system Georgia texas Florida Tennessee Kentucky the bible belt Alabama. And like Thor I took a new love kid's lost the love I moved with a tumor I said goodbye 5yrs thinking of the surgery wasn't successful I'd be buried with family if successful like it did in 2018 I had to start from scratch as I'm doing now I needed a purpose.i found one my daughter's 11 and 13. Come home daddy fight these raciest sexiest classit bastards get our rights back.stop plastic bottles coke and Pepsi and nestle hold on babies daddy's coming.thank you Thor I'm fighting for the children now
He doesn't want to say the wrong things in case people in the industry that he might see it and look at his projects the wrong way. I think he just feels obligated to review a marvel movie despite not really enjoying it. There was ZERO "real" criticism in this review besides a very restraint comment about how everything was thrown together and that the structure was a bit odd. Half the video was talking about the artists themselves and not the movie. I love Chris and what he has done to progress his film making dream, but his reviews have become a bit too safe and free of criticism that it doesn't seem to be informative. Judging by the big dip in views the last year or so, I think most of the viewers would agree.
I really respect you not wanting to attack a movie because of your decision to go into film making! However, as an actress myself, a big part of learning the craft is learning how to critique your peers in a way that feels constructive and not reductive. you’ve always struck me as a fair and smart guy, so I’d love to hear your opinion, especially if you don’t like it. I also think it’ll help you become better - but as someone who has excelleny reviewed media on youtube for past 10 years I bet you know that! lol keep up the good work !
I was expecting Thor Ragnarok type movie, it was on point and was exciting from beginning to end. I was hoping for something similar to Love and Thunder, but Love and Thunder was too long as far as boring scenes that didn't go anywhere other than time filler, not enough Ghorr god killing scenes, and way too much needless satire, and hardly any great fighting scenes. In my opinion, which does not mean squat, Love and Thunder was a 6 out of 10.
I kinda thought this was suppose to be more of a fun lighthearted movie from the beginning it seems like it's trying to be appealing to broader audiences
All Gods are bad movie.
It's cool to see how your critiquing style evolves as you dive deeper and deeper into filmmaking/directing. You critique way more from the perspective of an artist now, and it has been cool to watch you grow and evolve over the years. Best reviewer on the platform, love to see it
This movie just looks disappointing. I liked Ragnarok a lot but this seems like a rough watch.
I think the biggest issue was how the movie was produced. The comedy was not as bad as everyone was saying. It is just a short, rushed movie, and there are scenes obviously cut out or not finished.
Chris kissing Hollywoods @@@ is boring.
Watch RRR
From now on, I'm calling this movie Thor: Fagnarok
The sillier parts don't mesh well with the actually decent serious parts. Zeus not dying kind of ruins the most subversive moment in the movie. Everything about Jane is rushed. I understand one of the themes is living in the moment and doing what's right but we barely had time to breathe before she's become a god and then dead. Feels like it could have been done better. Christian Bale as Gorr the God Butcher was the most captivating aspect of the film but, as a recent comparison, doesn't really even come close to the captivation of Homelander in The Boys. Gorr deserved more screentime and development.
People need to stop watching reviews and reading posts on Facebook before their small minds go and watch movies. The movie was probably one of the best marvel have made. People really complaining that these movies aren't serious enough need to remember these movies are based off comic books which were meant for kids lol
your film reviews aren't good anymore. anyone that can't identify the negative impact feminism has had over the past 15 years isn't a film critic, they are propagandists
Honestly I came out really enjoying this film and don’t really understand the mixed reactions it’s gotten. I do believe the narrative isn’t as tightly paced as Ragnarok and that Gorr, while still being a compelling villain, definitely needed more screentime. But other than that? This was honestly a super fun and heartfelt romp with post-Endgame Thor, and if Ragnarok was like a 9/10, then this’s like a solid 8/10 and still leagues above the first two Thor films. I just believe like people are feeling fatigued with Phase 4 and don’t really feel like it’s going anywhere, and so decide to take that ire towards this film due to it being its own self-contained thing that doesn’t really have much to do with the MCU proper. Idk, people are entitled to their opinions and all, but besides Shang-Chi and No Way Home, this’s definitely my favorite phase 4 film thus far.
Love what your arm is doing to that Zelda tee.
I was not a big fan of this movie. It feels like the peak of MCU is over
some of us saw what taika waititi was about already in ragnarok in the way he treated the characters
This film made thor look like an Idiot, worst thor Film Ever !!
I’m not gonna see it until it comes out on $5.99 rental. Top Gun I will go see again before it leaves theaters.  I’ve watched your reviews long enough to understand that you’re obviously holding back on this.  I hope Marvel figures it out.  So many disappointing movies lately.  Not excited.
I already knew it was going to suck when the movie was shorten down to an hr and 40 mins and taiko refused to release a directors cut
The movie was fire, dumpster fire
as much as i enjoy waititi's work, i never go out of my way to hear what he says in interviews. maybe he has a deep, intellectual mind, but what he chooses to share has always just been wacky (and not even all that funny)
This wasn’t even a review of the film…. You spoke maybe 3 sentences about the film lol
It was weird, like watching a comedy.  The Avengers End Game was awesome because you felt the serious tension.
i am so tired of the MCU and its lame comedy
Honestly..... I think I just noticed how nice and symmetrical the new set is 🙌🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥
Taika Waititi is too much up his butt lately. We all know how good he is, he seems like he does not realize he is not the only good artist out there. Dissing a  underpaid, overworked fx team that openly, when the rest of the movie is not even that good...like...total asshole.
it felt like a kids movie
Even the novel _Caging Skies_ was turned into comedy...
4/10. Weighed down by not enough action, too many jokes, and randomized powers
Marvel died with Endgame nothing after that was any good not that any of the others are ground breaking. Thor movies are at best passable and this one I won't be watching either
I am as close to heartbroken as one could be over how they handled Jane Foster's Might Thor. There's a version of this movie in more willing hands than Taika Watiti that could've made an exceptionally gripping story centered around Thor and Jane's reunion as well as her inevitable fate to the backdrop of the God Butcher threat. Instead, we got this lazily insulting film that continues to shred whatever's left of Thor's lore and credibility (comics and the MCU). So disappointing.
I've heard some backlash, but I figured most people still enjoyed the movie and that the critics would've given it praise and never thought to check the Rotten Tomato score. 67% fresh with 6.6/10 rating as of this comment is surprising to me.
This movie would have been so much better if they made the run time 30 minutes longer. It seemed rushed. It could have had more context for Gorr and increased the stakes of what he could do.
If the Thor movies were a TV series, then Love and Thunder would be a throw-away filler episode. And I liked Love and Thunder, but it definitely had flaws and it really doesn't compare to Ragnarok
It's strange I have almost the inverse opinion. There's a lot I love in Ragnarok, but to me a lot of it is off. Either tonally or story wise. I kinda like that love and thunder is just a simple story. Gorr has clear motivation and his decisions make sense. While there were moments that went really close to corny or cringey, I was usually able to just be down with the vibe and it wasn't a big deal.
RDJ’s departure is the MCU’s slow fall from greatness. That dude single handedly made this franchise amazing. IMO
Always enjoy your videos Man, and I'm a subscriber but did you just say you enjoyed Shang chi? Don't tell me you like the eternals too. With the exception of Spider-Man no way home and Loki the series, it seems like the MCU is kind of having trouble finding their footing start the next phase. I don't know it's just my opinion but I thought changed she was just a throwaway movie, it was just kind of blah. And even Dr Strange, who I LOVE, I was a little disappointed with the multiversive madness. Not with the movie itself so much as it used to seem like every MCU movie was leading somewhere. And it was it was leading to Infinity war and Endgame. I don't know it just seems like they're spinning their wheels and don't know where to go. I saw Thor love and thunder, but Ragnarok led to something great. I don't know where I'm going with this, just kind of find it hard to believe that Ant-Man 3 is going to be the movie to bring us to the next big bad.
Jurassic World Dominion review ?
I feel pretty much the same. Exactly. Technically, I loved the movie, yes, but I was aware that things are missing from the movie, that things were filmed and didn’t get included. If they could have stitched certain things up it may have surpassed Ragnarok for me. Like I got left a little hungry when the film was over, I wanted to become stuffed and full to the brim by Love and Thunder and I liked so many of the elements so much that I honestly needed more of some of them to flesh them out completely.
Truthfully, knowing how terrible the VFX artists conditions and deadlines are, that comment Taika made about Korg not looking real rubbed me the wrong way. I have to say I also agree with Chris, the tone of everything with marvel right now just seems so weird.
What did **you** think of Thor, elder?
The first scene was amazing. It promised a completely different movie. Then everything fell apart.
More Gorr actually butchering gods would’ve helped. Thor and team never looked like they were in real  danger.
This movie is a both good and bad but somehow I enjoyed it. It’s a marvel Thor comedy like ragnarok. It’s honestly wholesome fun so I went in and just enjoyed it without tryna piece everything together. I’m also so glad Thor is NOT connected to the terrible multiverse story Kevin is tryna do. They butchering characters and villains left and right. Gorr deserved to be in 3 movies max this shuda been an intro and at the end Gorr disappears into the shadows to go on his god butchering leading into Thor 5. Why that didn’t happen idk but marvel and Kevin are doing terrible with the direction of the phase 4 and phase 5.
Come on Chris... Be real with this....
Since you don't review bad movies anymore does that mean no more hilariousity's?
Phase 4 hasn't been as well received because the Multiverse is a really janky subject. As soon as you have a trillion versions of everybody, it's hard to give a darn about consequences.  Also the shift to making the shows absolutely necessary has hurt the MCU (and Star Wars too). I know people who have left the MCU totally behind because of them. It's just too much ongoing content to keep track of.  And that's without crap like Morbius stinking up the airwaves too, which people will see since it's 'Marvel' as well.  I think the bubble has burst due to oversaturation and from now, it will die a prolonged, very slow but inevitable death. Unless they slow down on their MCU shows and ditch the Multiverse thing quickly. The movies also need to be a little bit more self contained again too...
hated this film, i just don't get the direction.
I thought the jokes about Stormbreaker being jealous were set-up to the Necrosword actually being the villain with the plan to kill the gods. Because the sword has a history of killing gods and because Gorr had no idea of eternity until he got the sword, I assumed the sword’s plan was to kill eternity
I was talking to my boyfriend (he just graduated from an animation program and he was looking into internships and what not) and he heard that a bunch of Marvel vfx artists were rushed and were overworked for this along with being told by Disney to add things at the last minute. I can definitely see it with this film. I think he heard this from a Reddit thread where the artists were sharing their issues.
When you've seen a movie a week before Chris Stuckmann has reviewed it!....
It was absolute crap!!
I’m getting tired of people pretending, or trying so desperately to like this movie. It was legitimately bad. It’s wild that people will mock overly goofy marvel shows and movies, then tread such light ice trying to compliment this horrible movie.
It sucked.  Just admit it.
Review RRR, please!
This is the nicest way to say marvel is getting sloppy and the movies have sucked.
They're just churning out these marvel movies. When will the public wake to the fact that hollywood needed to move on from the marvel franchises years ago?
Being a kiwi myself, taika waititis humour is very much how it is in nz ie: self deprecating and a lot of "taking the piss". We actually get great mileage out of people not knowing if we're being serious or just joking, so it looks like taikas really revelled in the press promo for this movie lol.
I don't get how someone could love Ragnarok and not Love and Thunder. For me L&T has too much bathos in it but no more so than Ragnarok indeed arguably it is better at avoiding ruining the emotional or climatic scenes with a joke than Ragnarok (which destroys the logic of its own finale with a Hulk joke)...  Ok it doesn't have an action scene as good as Thor vs Hulk, but it has a better villain and as I say better used humour. Which I largely found funnier too.  So as someone that was only so so on Ragnarok I really don't get why people are complaining at this film for having all the same issues as Ragnarok when they claimed to have loved that film. It just makes no sense to me 🤷‍♂️
I'm kinda sad for what they did to Thor's character, they made him a joke. I could never take him serious at any part of this movie, it seemed like a slap in the face to any Thor fans. The film was like 70% comedy and 30% serious, every scene Christian Bale was in was amazing, they wasted sm potential.
Funny, Top Gun Maverick kept popping in my mind while watching this movie. I also plan to go see it a third time too
Dope shirt.
(God)Butchered in the editing room
I was honestly utterly disappointed in this film. I was very excited to see Gorr and his story with Thor and what we got was ok at best. I hate the amount of screentime Bale had and the story has been butchered for his character. In the comics Gorr is one of Thor's best villains traveling the multiverse killing other versions of him I thought we would see some of that, we didn't. The ending I thought was a complete waste for (SPOILERS) Jane's character. I really enjoyed her in the movie and to kill her off was a really bad decision. Just like Gorr's ending and overall the film was a complete mess for me. I thought the humor was better for this movie but with a great character like Gorr and even Mighty Thor to deduce it down to a SNL skit type tone is just disrespectful to the respective actors and characters. Marvel really needs to start doing better.
Hot take: either make Kevin Feige once again just responsible for Marvel Studios or remove him al together. As the creative head of Marvel (in its entirety) he has to much on his plate and everything is blending together.
It kinda just felt like they lost the character of Thor from Thor Ragnarock, he just felt too silly to often. When I rewatched Ragnarock he was silly and fun but took dangerous situations way more seriously. Too many jokes this time around. Not a bad movie by any means. But something that has characters with more potential than the final product.
Honestly one of the most fair and thoughtful assessments I’ve seen about this movie
Even the Hammers overacted in this movie.
Been waiting for the Stuckmann review since BEFORE I saw the movie. Holy moly it was too much, too many times.
Chris you are losing your fan base with your watered down reviews. Really disappointed in the content lately but looking forward to your film.
Elvis review Chris?
Worst Marvel movie to exist so far, hands down.
Just realized I spent the first two minutes listening to you babble about Fing ads
Yea I wasn’t huge on it either. Especially since I just watched Ragnorak to get hyped for this one. Super pale in comparison.
Why review movies if you can’t be negative?
1/10 worst director of all time after Rian Johnson
The movie should have been two and a half hours, featured more Gorr, Jane Foster and serious moments.  As it stands, it feels like a jumbled mess of comedy and serious tone and too rushed.
so many words to find a nice, corporate way to say that they didn't seem to try with this movie lol
This movie absolutely sucks. It is hot trash. God's bring killed off screen lol. We had to see the pics of their dead bodies verses actually seeing those fights. Thor was made into a joke and idiotic. Jane becomes Lady Thor off screen, which is also lame. This flick was bad..Oh Yeah Thor is a single adoptive dad now HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH. TRASH Flick. Bring back the Russo Brothers please.
*CHRIS STUCKMANN FOR OCARINA OF TIME MOVIE*
Loved this movie! Just a good time! And Thor growing was awesome! Need a directors cut
TL;DR - bad movie, okay comedy
*CHRIS STUCKMANN FOR STARFOX MOVIE*
Thor was his best in Infinity War he was funny but not at the cost of his character losing credibility. And he was serious and badass when he needed, like when he arrived in Wakanda. We need to bring back that Thor persona, especially with the short hair. Love and thunder and Endgame turned Thor into a joke of a character with no seriousness. Disappointing really.
Top Gun Maverick was a terrible film
I wish gor killed Thor in the movie and he was henceforth known as Gor the Thor butcher.  And then he went on to become a pig farmer and he'd become known as Gor the Boar butcher.  And when he got sick of that he'd move on to home demolitions and be known has Gor the Floor butcher.  Etc.
Bro, you should just review a movie like you normally do.
*Pros* • The performances of Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Tessa Thompson, Taika Waititi, and Christian Bale, *especially* Christian Bale, are top notch. • The visuals are dazzling, maybe the best in any Marvel movie to date. • The general structure of the plot is good.  *Cons* • The pacing is *breakneck* speed; this movie felt like an hour and a half to me. • Gorr isn’t in enough of the movie. • Too many jokes.  *Overall:* 7.5/10
Its just a collage of silly scenes. Taika is great but here he seems to be afraid to be serious2/3 of the movie. Some land some don’t and some stuff just overstay their welcome. Marvel is doing a lot of this setting up something in a movie and leaving it behind in another, like Mordo’s quest in the post credit scenes of Dr Strange or TGoTG with Thor. And that’s quite disappointing. The 4 phases did that so much better (not perfect). And now they seem to strugle with a Post-mega-event Syndrome where they don’t seem to be very sure of the kang thing or whether they should or not revolve around another “thanos” level threat. I see the lack of cohesion and security in a plan now.
They spent way too much time pushing M-SHE-U  Propaganda and not enough time working on a good plot and character development specifically with the protagonist and the main antagonist.  Take movies like Skyfall or The Dark Night, and how they really focused on exploring the antagonist.
I came away from the film very disappointed, should have been more serious given the use of Gorr the god butcher
Don’t start shilling please
As a 4th sequel this movie was really good. How often is a 4th sequel to something even remotely good?
This movie should have been split into 3 different movies:   1. A movie with Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy going on adventures together.  This is what Engame hinted at   2. A lady Thor movie that actually follows A Hero's Journey. to be worthy to get Mjnoir due to her cancer.   3.  Gorr butchering gods. Thor investigating. There's a lot of world building on the gods.
When you start making fun of your own movies, before people can do it in the comment section, You know you put out a half-a$$ product and are trying to play it off all cool like you don't even care what fans think. What a bunch if losers.  When the big name producers stop caring about their own product, It's time to start supporting INDEPENDENT ARTISTS!
Nice of you to promote your own little movie when we came to this channel to hear about the "Thor" review. Maybe wait until the review that we clicked on is over before you try and sell your film, yes? Edit: ffs, Two minutes of you trying to shill stuff. Take a cue from other channels that recap and either wait until towards the end or make your commercial funny, or at least interesting.
hey Chris are you going to do the review for the latest Jurassic World?
Never heard that quote before. Fun!
For me Love and Thunder felt more like an SNL skit of a Thor movie for most of it but the jokes don’t land well and runnings gags outstay their welcome. It’s almost cringe. Too many jokes and not enough time to sit in serious dramatic moments that wouldve meant more if it had more room to breathe. Plot and story felt very rushed and we got to things with characters that don’t feel earned in the midst of a million jokes a minute. The emotional beats dont make you feel the way it should. Christian Bale deserved better for sure. He was amazing as Gorr and needed more screentime to show more of his story, character and him actually butchering Gods but it kind of felt out of place in this more comedic movie. Its like if Heath Ledger as Joker in terms of performance and story was thrown into a SNL sketch. Gorr shouldn’t have been the villain for this tone of a movie which sucks to say because Christian Bale was amazing. There were no stakes really. Watched Ragnarok right before Love and Thunder and Ragnarok had a way better balance between jokes, drama, tone, dialogue, story, and character development. And the jokes in Ragnarok landed way better than in Love and Thunder. The theatre i went to only had a big laugh the first time the goats came in and screamed but that was really it. I really didnt like Thors character or his arc much in Love and Thunder. Thor has gone through the most tragedy and loss, yet his character in Love and Thunder is like when he went to SNL to do skits of Thor. He is a caricature, not someone who is humanized or one that you can empathize with. Thors best trilogy and story arc is between Ragnarok, Infinity War, and Endgame.
If you're not gonna be honest with us just for your career sake im out ,this Is not the way
You're gonna REVIEW STRANGER THINGS 4?
They are going backwards in his character development.  He has become a clown.
This was a nice review of the marketing in Thor...when will you review the movie???
Have we reviewed Top Gun? I feel like we should have reviewed Top Gun
This movie was out right garbage just like Moon knight and Eternals. Ms Marvel, hawkeye,  Loki,  Shang shi were really good and Doc Strange 2 was fine (they should have made it at least a 15 with more darker tones) also however, they should take time to release things and not rush them otherwise you'll end up with another love and thunder crap.
I have this weird feeling that I left the movie wanting to like it more than I actually did…
Did Chris find a way to review movies without reviewing them ???
I am very curious to see how they handle Black Panther 2. I have no idea how that will not be a trainwreck
Go Shelby oaks!
I miss when you would give grades and weren’t afraid to tell us which movies were shit
Chris I don't know if cutting your own ball's to be accepted as a movie maker is going to be worth it. But hey here we are, Let's hope for the Best.
The Eternals is the best Phase 4 movie for me, and as more time comes by I love it even more
Eww. Can't believe you liked this.
I’m taking my kids to see it tomorrow. I’m sure that we’re going to have a blast 💥!
It’s come out Chapek or however you spell his name made them cut a lot out of the movie and rushed the CGI. That’s why they’re so out in the open about the problems. Because they feel the CEO ruined their movie
So is Thor the all father now ?
This mofo, just said that he will only post positive reviews, and that is because he has crossed over to film making. WTF? Good or bad youre supposed to let the people know man! i can see a new arrogance about you. i dont like it either. This dude thinks he's Ron Howard now or something.  Well, at least Jahns keeps it real.
I was actually thinking 5 minutes before finishing this video to see Top gun 2 again
Too much comedy in these movies to take them seriously anymore - really takes away from the experience.  Zeus in a ballerina tutu, really?  These jokes go too far and are not laughable.
I'm so glad the Russo's plan is working basically making the best movie possible so that way they are begged to come back and help / save the company of Marvel cinematic universe. Like how in the world can you top end game?! It would have to be a battle world situation with Doom, and the Russo's are perfect for it.
I enjoyed the movie considering it was a very visually embellished and entertaining but it's not Ragnarok. However, Bale's performance was incredible. Reminded me of Pennywise in a few scenes.
I dnt like how weak zues was. He's a sky father.  I dnt know if liked how the mcu used odin either
Movie is terrible
This movie was sooo bad ….
TIME SAVER Actual review starts at 2:10
Honestly, bring back Branagh as director. I loved the first Thor. He approached it, I think, from a very Shakespearean angle (his background as a filmmaker), which worked in its favor.
This was a very non-committal review. Like he’s worried about offending anyone. The movie version of “my food wasn’t very good, but at least it was warm!”
I had been waiting on your review for this one. 🙂 My wife and I saw it a few days ago, and were underwhelmed. I agree that the visuals were great, and I loved each of the actors. But as a whole, it felt very disjointed and strange. I'm fine with a film being less structured and more chaotic, but whereas that worked for Ragnarok, it didn't really work this time I don't think.   I definitely want to see Chris Hemsworth continue to play Thor in the future, he seems to really love it. This movie screams for an extended cut, that's for sure.
Glad I’m not the only one who’s seen Top Gun: Maverick 3 times lol
I find it baffling that you never mention the feministic sjw tendency even when it is cringeworthingly obvious and reduces the quality of the story. Thy always belittle the original hero while they points to the one who will carry the torch in the future to keep milking the product. Dinsney Marvel and Star Wars is a product, not art.
Yeah that’s how I get leaving the theater with my son. It felt like it wasn’t directed by TW and I LOVED RAGNOROK. I left the theater like I watched it once and I’m good
That’s King Valkyrie to you!
Skip first three minutes
this movie felt like a 'filler' movie. Also noticed, MCU post endgame, seems very loosey goosey on continuity...
The emotional moments in this movie hit so hard
Maybe it's just me but Marvel has been off their A-game since the Infinity Saga ended. The only property that I've genuinely liked is Spiderman. Everything else has been pretty mid.
I want to see the 4 hour cut
When will you do your Spoiler review for Dr.Strange 2 ? Stop being lazy  You're just at home lying down on bed watching movies. What else do you do Chris?
Im tired of Mcu fanboys sugar coating it. This movie was really really bad. I think it’s up there with one of the worst mcu movies
Meh kinda boring. Movies suck nowadays.
2:35: "As you guys know, I don't make videos about movies that I really didn't like anymore." Chris✍️Stuckmann ✍️did✍️not✍️like✍️Elvis (2022)✍️
Is everyone else sick of this shill? Get off taika waititi dick this was just a goofy comedy not a superhero movie. Thor movies are barely even connected because they don't know how to write the character. You thought Cate Blanchett in Ragnarok was a really good villain?😳 please explain how so? I would say the first half of Ragnarok is funny sure but damn I can't watch the second half absolute trash.
why didn u review Men(
TAIKA made Thor into comedy /parody show.... Come on! The amount of cheesy and unnecessary jokes and stupidity is annoyingly trash af! Fire him and get someone who can actually make a proper movie ....
I'm also on the fence with this one. I have a feeling that there was some studio intervention that caused the disjointed feel of the movie. Russell Crowe really stole the show with playing Zues. For me it felt like his inspiration for Zues was the legendary comedic actor Dom Deluise.
it is so sad to see kevin faige, man who built MCU empier, now treated by disney like some looser. I believe the only reason why he didn't leave MCU yet is he love to much this franchise.
Congratulations on your creative endeavor!  Hope to get a chance to see it. Frankly, I'm concerned that Kevin Feige is losing creative control in the MCU due to Bob Chapek. I also feel like the MCU is lacking narrative focus.   SOOOOooooo  -  off topic  -  any chance that you'll get around to reviewing Stranger Things Season 4???  At the risk of sounding presumptuous, I think we're curious to know your thoughts.
tea

How younot gonna mention the GOATS?!? Best part of the movie for me! I loved this movie. Opened with a tragedy, lota of jokes and fun, more tragedy...and ends with Thor as a father. It was adorable and I loved it. As a father of 2 girls, it made me happy.
Yes Top Gun has so much rewatchability!
Was disppointed by Thor L&T.  Not so much that is was a bad film but that the comedy aspects were overdone that a really good potential story was lost.  Gorr could have been a Thanos level villain, someone you rooted against but understood their motivation.  Instead we get a lot of inconsistencies in particular in how Thor's power can be used by others.
Shawn Chi? Really? Also, Spider Man was a Sony movie. Disney Marvel has yet to make a good movie after End Game.
This was a good movie. I don’t understand the overly picky critiques of the visual effects. I don’t get it. They’re fine. You have to be super super picky to have something to complain about. And you’re probably under 25 years old and have been spoiled with great graphics your whole life.
omg what do u think about Elvis????
IW Thor best IMO. Too many 🤡 characters in the MCU…wait, is that what the C stands for?
The reason no way home worked so well apart from the good fan service was a darker tone but still sneaking wholesome moments and funny jokes every so often
This might be my favorite Thor film. Perfect blend of comedy and drama.
Saw that vid with the director and thompson and it made me think "boy did these people enjoy making the movie at all really? Following such a free flow doesnt give me much hope for a planned carefully thought out marvel movie.
I would love to see your Ms Marvel review!!
hi
Do they have any plates of Godzilla on tnere?
Dude u have time to review this generic movie but dont gave time to review The Northman?
What happened to the Thor of the comics??  Brutal serious and God of Thunder !!  Remember what they did with The Predator?  Well .... They've done it to Thor !  Adios Marvel it was good while it lasted
Never understood why people like marvel movies, all of them are horrible. You watch 1 you watch them all, super cheesy comedy, 90% is green screen its just really bad movies. These movies feel more like parodies instead of movies. The only good thing that i saw with a Marvel name is Netflix Daredevil and The Punisher. Everything else is pure trash and garbage.
Thud and Launder!
stranger things sason 4 review ??
The reason why people dislike this film is the reason I hate all MCU movies. Everything is just a complete joke and rarely is anything taken seriously. That's why I like DC movies betters. DC movies. Not DCEU.
ATLEAST the soundtrack is awesome!
Personally I was kinda iffy when the movie started but I quickly warmed up to it and ended up enjoying by the end.
agree with your thoughts. enjoyed movie, but pacing was off, too much of the goats, thor’s character arc didnt carry over from endgame.
Wrong villain for a comedy show.  Watiti shoulda saved all that lousy attempt at jokes to establish the God butcher as a valid Threat.  Have him kill few powerful gods, show up in omnipotent city and wreak havoc.
Chris: I'm going to see Top Gun a 3rd time. Me: You gotta pump those numbers up. Those are rookie numbers in this racket.
why isn't he rating movies anymore!
Let’s just be honest… This movie sucked because typical Hollywood always chooses to go WOKE. And they’re never going to learn that the majority of people don’t want propaganda, and agendas shoved down their throat! If that’s not true… Then why did Top Gun Maverick do so well? I’m off my soapbox.
Please make a review on the boys
Taika tried to replicate Ragnarok - but the themes in this movie were a fair bit darker, so it simply didn't gel that well. It's a decent popcorn flick, but that's about it.
Ive not seen this but with the new marvel films i don't mind spoilers at all, but by the sounds of it this films ok but not great. Ill give it a watch when its on Disney Plus, but im kinda getting that the period where Marvel films were put together better is gone. Just my opinion so don't hate me.   Also best of luck on your film Chris.
Waititi and Thompson talking like that publicly was disappointing and very unprofessional. No wonder VFX people don’t want to work with Marvel.
its a shitty movie imo
I walked out. This phase is not going well
This movie is The Wonder Woman 1984 of marvel
I miss the days when you reviewed bad films but I do understand why it's a conflict of interest for you.
Honestly didn't think you would review this movie.😬
Don't blame you for seeing Top Gun a third time. Such a f*****g awesome film
I got shit on for saying I dont wanna review movies I dont like anymore. Everyone does nothing but go on about what they hate. so wanted to just talk about what I like. And it really upset and disappointed my small following
Did you do a The Northman review? What did you think of it??
The battle harden warrior Thor from Thor 1 is now a goofy idiot.
If you think Ragnarok is great, then you never understood Thor. Aks your opinion means nothing.
After seeing this movie twice in a span of two days, it wasn't that good. I loved Gorr despite the very little screentime we got of him and the visuals were great too, like the scenes with Jane as Thor or the end battle scene but other than that, the whole movie felt like an SNL skit which didn't sit too well. Hopefully the next Thor movie has Thor battle Hercules in a more serious way. You got someone who is strong if not equal to Thor and that should build some sort of power struggle. I might just rewatch Ragnarok because that movie handled Thor so well that it's a shame Taika didn't replicate what he did back then 🤷‍♂️
Little late on this bitch.
Oooooh I’m gonna check displates
I think it was a good movie. Should have cut the humor at the final fight.  Besides that, fully enjoyed it.  Even the Jane bit. I was worried about it, but it was respectful. Loved it
I’m not cutting Marvel any slack any more. After The Batman, there’s no excuse for such low effort. Not comparing DC to Marvel, I’m just comparing two big blockbusters, the Batman cost 85 million less dollars to make, say what you will about the movie, but from a production standpoint Love and Thunder is a joke in comparison. It’s just lazy filmmaking for a deadline as opposed to anything made with real heart. And Taika is not absolved of blame, he could’ve made a good film in spite of Disney if he took it seriously at all, but he’s stated publicly that he doesn’t give a shit about continuity and source material. It’s butt asshole. It’s watchable. That’s all it is. Watchable. That doesn’t make it good. Demand better.
This movie felt more like Kevin Feige asked who wanna fill this years slot of mcu release we lack one, hmmm taika you down? we just need a filler movie so make whatever you want don’t care 🤣
Chris back in the days would've gave this movie a D+ and we all know why. This movie was god awful.
Can I work with you?
Yeah this movie was a hard one to watch since it didn’t really go anywhere Phase 4-wise. Best Phase 4 movie right now is Shang Chi only say that because I’m not sure how things are gonna go with Spider-Man in future films.
I wished you analyzed and critiqued the movie more
This movie was garbage
Nah, I'm pretty sure they're getting away with saying things disparaging the film or aspects of it, because Disney is going to recut the movie to include aspects they cut for the theatrical release. And knowing them, they'll do a full theater release again for some more sweet sweet cash. They lay the ground work for people to want a Directors Cut and they act surprised when people demand it... all the while probably working on it right now.
I really really miss the boom boom fire boom intro to your videos.
The movie is a fun movie and i enjoyed myself. 7.5/10
Watched you for years and can honestly say this might be the first time I disagreed with. All your criticisms are valid, and they seem to be what a lot of other people felt too. I didn’t compare it to Ragnorok. I just enjoyed it as a one off Thor adventure, and thought it was absolutely fun and wholesome. Saw with my kid and it was fun to watch him at the edge of his seat, when the kids had their moment.
This mf ever review Jurassic Park?
Actress who play valkyrie acts the same way in every other movie or TV show.
A lot of jokes could of been cut for more Gorr scene.  DS2 went borderline rated R with violence. This movie could of used that for gorr scenes
sick shirt <3
I think the criticism for this movie is 100% warranted. It felt like a 2 hour long SNL sketch with no impact or weight to it.
“I don’t make videos about movies I don’t like anymore” Ah so that’s why we never got a review of Jurassic World 3
A lot of complaints about Thor 4 are legitimate. But that Thor is funny at the expense of his character is a misguided opinion, I think. Thor has by far the most tragic backstory of any other hero by the time Endgame rolls around. Endgame Thor showed how he slowed down and dealt with all that anxiety and depression. He doesn't take his life as seriously and he broke down. Thor 4 isn't too long after Endgame. He's not the same. The comic moments are character moments. That culminated in the final scene of Thor 4 which I think is Thor at his best. He has a full character arc from phase 1-4 and I think is one of the best handled characters in the MCU.
So chris didn't love the minions  rise of gru 🥲
Yeah i noticed that as the last couple reviews a while back i was confused by after watching said movies in some of those reviews so i was surprised to see ya in my recommended section again but yeah kind of hard to be a movie credit if your going to just suck up to every movie u review which seemed like that was happening. Cant really be a movie critic without being a movie critic n just because u want movie critics to use kid gloves on ur projects shouldn't mean they should as thats movie making as many would love to do it so good luck old friend.
Thor Love and Thunder was so dull and unfunny. waste of my money.
I honestly had a great time with this movie, mainly because it took two of my favorite things (Marvel and Guns N’ Roses) and made something that was pretty damn entertaining. I’d give it a B+ due to some of the problems it had, some of the jokes just didn’t land with me, and it clearly didn’t equal ragnarok
Im sick of Shelby Oaks already 😂
This trainwreck of a movie even managed to make Christian Bale uninteresting. Didn't even think that was possible. Well done.
Why didn’t  Chris stuckmann give it a rating???
The movie was bad.
This wasn't a review in my opinion, more like a "The creators are friends of mine so a weak thumbs up i guess?" lol
Hey Chris. I don't want to sound rude and I know your busy with Shelby Oaks, But when are you gonna do another Hilariocity review?  Kinda wanna see Godzilla (1998), Cat in the Hat, The One.
Lost me at "sequence with Russell Crowe as Zeus was pretty funny", Chris.
Thor Love and Thunder was...um, they're ok. I must say though, I much rather liked Taika Waititi's early work. His new movie was a little too on the nose for me with his new wave sense of humor for my taste. But when Ragnarok came out in 2017, I think  he really came into his own, commercially and artistically. The whole film has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the film a big boost. He's been compared to the best of film directors, but I think Taika has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor.
I'm loving your vibe chris!
Massive pile of shite
Please tell me your movie is releasing in India
LUV to see Chris do a review on the EPIC RRR!!! Fav movie of the year (Top Gun def second)
Curious to hear his thoughts on Jurassic World
Are you not making enough money from views? Your channel has become an advert, I'm out.
I love the part when he holds his sord up and says "Through the power of Grey Skull I command you." Then the music plays and he starts dancing 🕺🎶. Then Skull 💀 face guy shows up and he's the DJ.
I hated how passive Gorr's origin was. It needed about another 15 minutes in the beginning. Losing his family one by one, but never losing faith is his god. He should have had his daughter with him when he reached the oasis, too far gone to even drink water. He should have begged the god to save her as she died, only to receive indifference. His rage should have been palpable, and the crimes and corruption of the gods undeniable. Bale's performance was suffocated by Watiti's own seeming indifference to the character.
Kevin Feige is focused on acquiring the Dragonball franchise. They’ll continue to make Marvel content, but it’s going to take a backseat to the new stuff.
needed more Gorr....thats my only complaint
the sequence with Zeus was SOOOOO FUCKING cringe
2:57 ALL OF MY CO-WORKERS are saying this! Not abysmal... but not great either. Not really interested in seeing this one 🤷🏾‍♂️⚡️⚒
Could have used more Gorr scenes instead of the unnecessary 30 minute recaps by Korg which were not funny at all. I felt myself cringing through the entire first half of the movie with how forced the humor was.
I saw it last night the only good scenes were Christian bales the rest of this movie was fucking horrible I’m glad I went on a discount day to watch this movie
I have to go see this movie again tomorrow and I'm dreading it, I don't have the heart to tell the person I'm going with that I already seen it, she really wants to see it herself.  And the worst thing is, I can't smoke weed for awhile, so I have to go moderately sober, I can still take my pain meds, but they didn't help the first time I seen it so....
I dont understand why they used the same theater gig and wasted 5 minutes of screentime, when they could've shown more of Gorr in that time. Also almost all scenes with Korg were unfunny and unnecessary for the plot. The stakes never felt big because of all the goofyness and dumb humour. Weakest Thor movie for sure.
Taika is a talented artist who is wasting that talent to churn out woke trash.
If you dont give an artist a dead line, the artist will never turn in any work. The curse of being an artist is never being satisfied with your own work. No one will criticize your work more than yourself. (If you're one of the good ones) I thought the movie was great. Not as good as Ragnorok but a good follow up. I definitely like bro Thor more than Shakespearean blonde eyebrowed Thor
Anyone else think Chris has stopped the negative criticisms in his videos because he realises people are gonna criticise his movie?
Everyone keeps talking about how this film is missing something Ragnarok had. It's very simple. Two things. One, the element of surprise. We didn't know what to expect from a Taika Waiting Marvel Fi, but now we do, so it has less impact. And two, this film has lower stakes, and that's fine. Ragnarok is the apocalyptic event in Norse Mythology. All of Asgard is at stake. In this movie, yes, the gods are at risk, but the only gods we care about are Thor and Loki. The kids are kidnapped, but we know Marvel won't kill kids on screen in a PG 13 film. This Thor movie is structured mor elije a GOTG film, where Thor is just going on an adventure than his previous films that had larger stakes. This film is just a good time and it delivered that for me.
Stranger Things Szn 4 review soon?
I honestly appreciate filmmakers who don't censor their less positive thoughts on films. If Ari Aster came out with a video explaining why he doesn't like *X* horror movie, I would likely learn so much. I understand your reluctance, though. It can be hard to criticize art without appearing like you're criticizing the artist.
Nice shirt Chris. Love you repping my all time favorite video game 😎😆
This movie was very comedic, but totally enjoyable. It wasn't completely dull like most phase 4 films.
Watiti is like one of those "avant garde" chefs that thinks it will be cool and groundbreaking to turn a steak into foam.  If what you're hungry for is steak - that doesn't fly.  It's interesting to do things people haven't done before, but lots of times there's a darn good reason nobody ever tried that thing; they knew without having to be told that that thing would suck.
I actually liked this movie a LOT more than Ragnarok. I thought the character development here was much deeper and I cared a lot more about everyone involved. I think the plot is not as good as Ragnarok but the character development is far better than ever.
Haven't seen this movie, for the same reason I haven't really watched any Phase 4 movies.  Burnout.  I was 29 when Iron Man released.  I was 39 when End Game released.  I missed 1 theatrical released during that run.   But man, after End Game the desire to see more MCU stuff just wasn't there for me.  They did everything. They got the guy.  I was invested in the Thanos arc.   What's there to be invested in now?
He’s an Angry…Video Game…Neeeeeerrrrrr…oh wait. Wrong channel.
Why do so many Marvel productions feel unfinished now? Thor 4, Doctor Strange 2, Moon Knight, etc. I think Marvel should slow down with pumping out content.
Love the shirt Chris!
Could we get a Thor movie where Thor isn’t a total joke?🤷🏼‍♂️
After watching both Doctor Strange 2 and Thor 4, it seems like Marvel is trying to shorten their movies to 2 hours max. Both films feel like they're shorter than they were supposed to be and I'm wondering if that's to help w/ "super hero fatigue." It feels like Marvel is trying to lessen the stakes in every movie, while still trying to have a compelling story. One of my biggest frustrations with movies these days is that the plot is "everything is going to end if we don't save x." And maybe this is what Marvel is trying to step aside from: make a movie w/ personal stakes and not the apocalypse.   These movies feel like [too] family-friendly versions of the 90s/early 2000s superhero movies. But, can we also take a small moment to appreciate the horror elements we've been getting?! I think they're trying to test the waters and start pushing towards these darker elements for the possible Midnight Suns movie and Blade. Blade is going to be Marvel's most important upcoming film. This is the one film they can't fuck up, otherwise the millennials are going to cut Disney's profits severely.
ok. i'm so jealous of your TShirt. I love it.
It's not just about the bad VFX. I think there were instructions from production regarding the use of 'Platelight' tech which is being standardized as a filming methodology for Disney movies where they have invested heavily. The plan is to churn out more movies over time easily, more profit. But it kind of doesn't go well with every scene and the director is going along with a limitation of bad background shots.
Y’all think he’s gonna review stranger things 4
Top gun is boring. Thor is awesome
I had fun with the movie, but I think the Thor films may be getting a bit too jokey for their own good. It's like they saw "Thor: Ragnarok" and said "Okay, do that but MORE", and it feels like too much. Humor can help bring levity to a serious film, but too much humor can make the serious beats of the film feel inconsequential and wreck the tone.
Movie sucked.
Firstly, I think Jane and Thor's story needed a book ending and there is no other comic book story other than the Mighty Thor run which would do her character justice. More so, entice Natalie enough to come back. In that respect the movie gave me what I wanted, wrapped in a half baked rom com for sure. Secondly, I agree that Christian deserved a better movie. But the only reason he did it was for his  kids who are big fans of Marvel. The tonal shift whenever he comes  on screen did seem out of place but he had some genuine scary moments which I liked. Overall I'd say the audience Marvel caters to will be satisfied but surely it needs to be held upto a higher standard as the super hero genre is being redefined everyday. Be it The Boys/Invincible. Eagerly waiting for Wakanda Forever now to lend Phase 4 some much needed spark and gravitas...
Chirs literally said "Story was cut for the sake of jokes"
Your video had a Thor themed Old Spice ad. Glorious!
Getting an actor like Christian Bale to agree to do a Marvel movie, and then cutting a bunch of his scenes is just weird. Scenes cut (confirmed by Bale himself) were scenes with Jeff Goldblum and Peter Dinklage, Gorr's aggressive scream scene, Gorr scarring and mutilating his religious tattoos. And that's only what was openly talked about
I think the next Thor movie will have him being a full badass again. He was so lost for the past several years since Jane left him and his fight with Thanos. Now he's properly motivated for real
I have to say though that your review of the John Travolta film 'The Fanatic' though critical, was flattering because it told the story that the director may have wanted...😂 I have to take a pooh.
It's so cringe watching this man going excuse after excuse to not simply admit he didn't liked a fucking movie.
I think that the Gorr storyline in the comics is relatively long and somewhat complex. Maybe they had issues squeezing that into the movie? Or maybe the source material is not as good as for some of the other movies?
Thore as the clown of thunder ⚡ Best superhero parody movie I have ever seen. I don't recommend it though. It's not that serious as Ragnarok. Or the other thore movies.  Not for children though. Unless they remove some adult content.
I guess we now know how Chris felt about The multiverse of madness lol.
Love your videos, but this was not movie review. Title is misleading. What you did is trying to find excuses to place proper critique for really sloppy piece of Taika's work. My guess is that you trying to be nice to a fellow director and you obviously can't be both in this period if your life - director and movie critic. So you've chosen to spend time evaluating MCUs marketing department. That's not what this channel was about. You should make some time and consider how you want to approach it in the future. All the best with your feature, and may it be the first of many more to come .
Ragnarok/infinity war was peak Thor
what a shill
Mcu and Taika humor reached its peak before this movie. now its just annoying
Another feminist garbage 🗑
All visual artists would love a little more time to finish their work. Time is something they never have.
It wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t good.
dude tbh this review and your rambling thoughts are just as incoherent as the film.
Yes.. the trailer was exceedingly misleading. Especially the Gorr bits... the whole idea of the threat he poses is just non-existent. I felt cheated walking out of the film. Probably the first 5 mins came closest to what the trailer seemingly promised
I simply am not here for the review
The constant joking and weird vibes in this movie put me off a lot.  It was only the last 30 minutes of the movie that saved it from me completely hating it.  If an extended cut comes out I'll watch it but otherwise, this was a meh movie.
All the best with your new journey. However, do remember why fans come to your channel and subscribe; actual reviews, and calling things as they are. Nevertheless, wish you every success possible.
Hey Chris, huge fan of your reviews! Was wondering if we will ever get a review of "the northman"? Or if you've had time to watch it?  Obviously you are super busy so I understand! Just curious
Looking forward to your film bro
Ragnarok balanced the humor around Thor way better.  Thor went from being a real character who can find himself in funny situations to a straight cartoon.  I, unfortunately, am seeing a decline in marvel content that was inevitable.
What happened to the boys season 3 review? He didn't even make a video on the first 3 episodes when they aired. Did he lose interest with season 2 since it was a downgrade?
I’m not optimistic about the future of the MCU😢
Taika said that they put in weird ideas and try to make it work as a movie. That's why it feels like a script is missing. It's just a mix of random weird ideas.
The Dark World is better than this joke
I agree with you here. The movie had some great things going for it, and I feel a good 75% of the humor lands, but the story was very weak and there some weird tone issues.   I also found out how many cooks were in the writer's room kitchen, and that explains a lot.  It's a fine movie to watch like once, but I would wait for Disney+ for this one. I feel it's easily Waititi's worst movie
Legendary
It's pretty disappointing, especially coming from Taika.  Ragnarok set the bar pretty high but this was a huge letdown.
I’m not watching this movie. But I’m so glad to see Chris back to being more overall critical than last review. It’s not bad to give a little sour with the sweet. In fact it’s the best combination when talking about art/entertainment.
No more watching marvel movies in 1st week
Taika is a brilliant actor and director, his non Disney movies are really good, it’s time he leaves Disney and mcu behind and get back to his original roots.
Chris, don’t forget why you got so many subscribers!  I’ve been with you since you had only 20k followers. I miss your reviews. You were always genuine and candid when talking about movies. Just because you’re making movies doesn’t mean you can’t give your opinion. We like you because you’re not about click bait. But suddenly since you’ve been making films you are reluctant to give your critiques. Your reviews and takes on movies is why your subscribers surpassed a million. Please don’t forget this.   Love and Thunder was a very flawed movie. No need to apologize for saying so.
So no one's gonna talk about how they humiliated Thor 😬?
I got Taika Fatigui MCU died w/Endgame✌🤷
the movie sucked balls
Marvel has a track record of polishing and improving the VFX of its titles post-release. Eric Voss on New Rockstars discusses it in a video about the criticisms of the VFX in the She Hulk trailer. He cites specific instances of Marvel "fixing bad CG." Marvel is aware, they see the criticisms as valid, and they allow artists time to polish, albeit post-release. And i applaud them for that.
To me, this felt like the first cut of a great movie. I don’t know if Feige is getting stretched too thin since there’s just so many Marvel projects being pumped out or if the same is happening with Taika, but I feel like they finished the first shoot, went “good enough,” and called it. Which is extremely odd since this movie got an extra year of development because of COVID, although filming restrictions may have played a role. Just feels very weird coming off of Ragnarok, which felt so ironed out.
Wow Thor was treated like a complete dumbass in this movie.  I didn't hate it but it was disappointing for sure.
A friend said that if you enjoy Waititi's humor in shows like WELLINGTON PARANORMAL, you'll enjoy this film.  I don't like humor based on. the main character/s being a moron/s so I doubt I'll enjoy this film.
I do wonder how much better the original 4hr cut of this movie is? 🤔
To quote Mark Benardin, I had a great time watching a film I didn't like very much. I've seen T:L&T twice and while I was entertained for the most part, it honestly wasn't very good. And there are plot holes you can drive ocean liners through. There have been some MCU missteps lately and I really believe it's because Feige doesn't have complete control over these projects. There was I'm guessing A LOT cut from L&T that we didn't get to see. Hell, Lena Headey was paid 7 mil for a role that was completely cut altogether. Jeff Goldblum and Peter Dinkledge were supposed to be in the film as well. I can only wonder how much better this film would've been if Gor was fleshed out more... And I honestly don't understand how Jane becomes Thor but continues to get sick anyway? Then what's the point? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
Taika Watiti honestly let his ego go to his head on this one. He's only interested in how many jokes he can make, and that video of them disregarding and mocking the Visual Effects is just not okay. Keep him away from Marvel.
I'm no Stan but I loved the film. And I thought Dr Strange 2 was mid and The Suicide Squad was dogshit to prove I'm no Stan. But definitely needed more Gorr.
If its in the public domain criticism and praise go hand in hand.
To be honest, I miss Chris's old reviewing style, being critical about them and giving A+ or B+, or C.
You’re so wise Chris, a true maestro🙏🏼
This movie was a disappointment. Enough said.
you don't need to hold your punches Chris... Just admit it's bad... Don't worry about being blacklisted by Disney
I can’t say what I really mean or want because I’m a film maker now and I met the director 😒
Chris told me all he had to tell me with... Ill probably never watch Love and Thunder again but I  hope they make something more like Ragnarok.....  We know Chris, we know.  It sucked.  lol
I hope Watiki doesn't do the next Thor because although he makes funny movies this Thor lacked the seriousness especially facing an opponent such as Gorr who should've gotten as much screen play like the Russo brothers did with Thanos. He put more emphasis in making the goats the center punchline in the movie than making an epic battle between Thor and Gorr. We only saw one god killed yet Gorr is a god butcher. I certainly Marvel isn't allowing Disney to wreck it like it did our beloved Star Wars by cutting out scenes that would've made this movie far more better and intense. I give it a C
I kinda think marvel should just stop ATM. There's too much and most of it is generic and filled with bad cgi. And yes, cgi is bad if the first thought i get is "that's cgi" instead "looks fucking good"
I was surprised how much I liked Thor 4. I don't think it is as good as Thor 3, but I was expecting to only find this one OK, but I kind of loved it.
Gray man review?
I think Taika is lost in his own fandom now tbh. I don't think he's passionate anymore.
Bring back Kenneth Branagh
I think the movie is deeper than most people think, probably b/c of the humor & spectacle. A 2nd watch revealed a lot of depth for me, i anticipated the jokes & spectacle so i had more headspace to devote to the quieter moments, the nuance in the drama and emotion. I think this is one of those movies that, over time, people are going to come back to and view it differently. Like, - don't watch it again until it drops on D+, then watch it and tell me it isn't a movie for Gen Z's & tweens and that it's a greater film from that POV. This is a movie that's going to lead to younger generations to discovering Frank Frazetta, American Psycho, and a fascination i myself had as a youngster with mythologies from various cultures. Think about a movie from your own young adulthood that was a gateway to developing other interests, those types of movies generally age well.
Congrats on 2 million subs Chris
I believe chapek has taken away some of the creative power from feige so it is possible it is effecting the way everyone is dealing with it
Crazy 4 Hour version of this movie so much was cut real sad
I’m glad Chris used his “meh” token on this movie. This was built up a lot and it was enjoyable but not what I thought it would should/could be with the time and talent given.
I want to see your thoughts on Incantation out on Netflix
I love how Chris' thumbnail always seems to tie to his opinion on the movie. One glance at the thumbnail and you already know what's coming.
Sorry man. This movie was boring.
Thor acting like a king in that one scene gave me some hope, but it went unnoticed and quickly back to Valkyrie doing nothing.
Lately Marvel movies feel like made for tv movies. Like they aren't spending as much time and money on them. Reminds me of when Terminator 3 came out. It was like made for tv compared to T2.
I hope that in response to this backlash that alot of phase 4 films are getting that Kevin Feige and Marvel take a step back and really rethink out their plan and take time with their content. We don't need 3 movies and 4 shows out every year. Quality over quantity.
I know you’re a busy man but would love to hear your thoughts on Stranger Things 4 if you ever get time.
X: on a level of 1-10 how much do you love Chris? me: yes
Ragnarok really grew when people could rewatch at home, I think this film will similarity benefit from this, it did feel like it needed a longer running time.  I really enjoyed it, I'm always thinking about these movies being made during pandemic, the vibes kinda janky cos reality is as well.  Phase 4 is about family, its been pretty emotional in its impact but not as engaging with the bigger picture.
This was more of a review of behind the scenes stuff than it was the movie itself.
Your thumbnail was my EXACT expression when I was leaving the movie theatre after seeing this.
i havent seen the movie yet, but it seems like we’re going back to the batman & robin, spawn, steel era of superhero films. while that is a bad thing for the state of super hero films, i think it’s a good thing for the state of cinema going forward. especially after the new top gun exceeding the box office at the moment
dude can't wait to judge your film. lol
Such a baddddd movie 😴😴😴
Oversaturated comedy which didn't give room to serious scenes of the film to breath which was needed. Pacing, plot conveniences was all over the place and made me left with more questions than answers.   Did Odin end up in Valhalla as he didn't die in battle? I thought the Bifrost was only there for the protected 9 realms? Since when did Stormbreaker have like a consciousness? Heimdall's son appeared to the move the plot along How dose Love have powers when she didn't earlier on in the movie?
What Gorr was in this movie. I thought he was a background character in a romantic comedy.
I’m glad you were critical while still maintaining your status quo
This movie sucked. It was basically dick jokes like Guardians 2. Taika has to go, he’s turned Thor into a complete idiot.
Apparently Taika Waititi was given a mandate to make the movie under 2 hours, looks like a lot of story of the film ended up in the cutting floor, that maybe why it feels a bit disjointed and given the interviews, I think Christian Bales Gorr the God Butcher suffered the most, his storyline was butchered to say the least
Gorr is my favorite Marvel villain by far because it really has a reason to be bad but not just because of money, power, or theory. What I don't like about this movie was it feels like Guardians of the Galaxy. A little too carefree. I love Thor 1, a serious movie with a good villain, and a little jokes.
This movie made me appreciate Thor Dark World more.
Ok great. But did you watch Elvis?
Lol, Chris...you are FAR too kind to this movie. Whether it be professional courtesy or not, combining Dumb and Dumber with the Hawkman from Flash Gordon, and sprinkling in a little Real Weapons Of Norse Gods reality show, you get an abysmal movie. When the titular hero is made to be the dumb jock of every bad teen angst movie ever made, it's embarrassing. Literally everyone else's characters, except the Guardians, who were reduced to battlefield fodder, were great. The problem with my criticism of the movies is that I probably laughed at 85% of it, but that's not the balance of comedy i look for in a superhero movie.
A bit disappointed, no real review of the film in this vid. Was looking forward to your thoughts of how the movie went cause a lot of film youtubers enumerated what the film's problem for them.
6/10, good movie and entertaining but just too many problems hold it down
I don't know if you read the comments, but will you do an Elvis review? I'd love o hear your thoughts
Are you gonna ever review jurassic world dominion?
There was too much buffoonery and not enough God Butchering for me to like this movie... It was so bad to me that I'm ready for a new director.
I can’t wait for the day when writers will understand that Certain comic Villains are just as important and compelling as the heros.
Hi Chris  You've actually critized a movie , that hasn't happened for a while now
You wouldn't liked the movie if you watched Ms Marvel series. Marvel set the bar really low with that one.
video starts at 2:08
“I make movies now so I won’t fully critique these shitty marvel movies anymore” is a terrible approach.  How about you instead just tell the full truth about something?  Trying to make your own movies while covering up that marvel has become a pox on the entire industry is not going to do you any favors
One of the weaker mcu movies.
Does Marvel have a "big bad" to replace Thanos yet? If not, I feel that is what is missing.  A lot of the investment we have put into these stories revolves around the idea that all of these characters matter in a grander sceme.   A lot of that is lost when the films (while entertaining!) feel disposable.
Marvel Zeus terrible DC Zeus awesome
I love Thoöa:  Lav & Thandæ But i to missed Krischen Beyle
Glad to see ya come back for the Thor review and just like you I def felt the same. But I can’t help but just laugh throughout the entire movie, which I can’t say I’ve ever laughed in a Marvel film from start to end. Yes, some of the comedy bits were over the top but that’s Taika for ya. Probably the only person I know who can make Stormbreaker hilarious 🤣🤣🤣 hope to see more from this team!
I not a fan of Thor Ragnarok, for me that film kill Thor and turn him into a joke, Waititi is a good director, but not for Thor......and this movie pretty much show why.......for me the last time Thor was an amazing character was in Infinity War, after that and Ragnarok happen......he became a MEME.
I think Taika got carried away by his earlier success. He provoked the fans several times when making this movie. I think he did that again when promoting the movie. As if as long as he didn't care，the audience couldn't blame him for anything. But that's not the case.🙄🙄🙄 BTW，good luck with everything Chris.
I did not like it.
I still loved the movie. Very uplifting in hard times like these.
There just threading water until Secret Wars .
I never felt that way about editing
Damn not Stranger Things s4 spoiler review 😔
I can't wait to see Shelby Oaks. So excited for you!
But it was "gayest" Thor film yet! I dunno how anyone can't just love this film!
I feel like Taika wanted a longer film. And they made him fit it under two hours.
It's Thor's 4th movie so I understand the loose-ness. Seems like Marvel is phasing him out yet at the same time cashing in.
Haven’t watched it ever since watching the trailer, over the top comedy made me cringe and the reviews haven’t convinced me at all.
Chris I just want to let you know that you are amazing. Despite working on a feature film and being so busy you still go out of your way to give us videos like this. Bless your soul man.
I'll wait for the 3 hour directors cut
Man, Marvel movies have turned into parodies of themselves....
Love the shirt.  ❤️
Also Disney was trying to capitalize all the money they could have therefore less movie, not 2 and half hours, so the cinemas have more screenings
This wasn't even a review? Its you talking about how hard it is being a director. Its becoming unbearable...
I thought “Not every God... has a plan” was in reference to how Gods are not looking over us, which may be seen as a knock on the Bible, but mainly, this is how Gorr came to be. The questioning of our faith should have been the theme, but it seems to be lost in all the comedy. Also, the villains should be made the focal point a this stage in the MCU. We've know enough about Thor... and the way to move forward is with interesting antagonists that challenge him. They should have done more with Gorr.
When I saw "Not every god has a plan". I was excited I thought it would be about Thor finding himself, it wasn't really like that.
After reading gorrs backstory I’m a little more irritated at the movie
Love hearing your perspective Chris ❤️
Interesting that they allowed the cast and crew to disparage the VFX artists right after an article is released about how Marvel underpays and overworks their VFX artists and VFX artists are told to avoid Marvel Studios when looking for work for this reason.  Almost as if they’re trying to make the artists seem like shitty so they can justify their shitty behavior.
This was a parody. Even Chris Hemsworth said it in an interview, "The story was sacrificed for a joke." I'm sure Taika has the actual movie stashed away somewhere. There's too much of Taika in this movie to be an actual story about the characters. Every character is the same. Taika speaks. Change costume, change character. Copy paste again.
Love & Thunder was actually the weakest of all the Thor solo films.
dude im begging you review jurassic world dominon?!
Some comics are mean to be goofy, not all serious
Review Elvis please.  Great movie
i expected this movie will be way more complicated, i thought thor'd stay fat and funny hanging out with the guardians but no, they broke up and thor got back to the boring hot guy. Then why bring them together if you just set them apart immediately?
omg good luck with the rough cut! i swear that kind of imagination challenge to pictoure what it would look like is one of the hardest part of filmaking
They have made Thor a dumb jock as a character.
Overall I really enjoyed the movie, really liked seeing Thor’s development. Although I do think there should’ve been 20 more minutes with mostly more of Gorr. I actually thought the serious moments weren’t overshadowed by comedy this time around
Bout walked out of the theater the second Jane foster came on screen
I don't think they realized that Thor killed off any credibility of the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise. Thor just came in and didn't even try and defeats an army that they were about to be destroyed by...it made no sense. This entire movie really didn't do anything to advance the story of Thor...just seems like a cash grab because Hemsworth is so popular.
I get it....but, I'll still miss Hilariousity Reviews.
That's exactly what I thought too. I didn't see enough of Gorr. A wasted character at best. There was so much they could've done with his character. And they fell flat at ever turn. The whole movie fell flat. There was very little serious tone to it
I’m happy to hear you talking about the behind the scenes of this film because I do believe it is what hindered this movie it isn’t anyone fault it happens even with big budget films like this
Dude if your movie isn’t good people are gonna tear it the fuck up but for the love of god don’t let that stop you please don’t forget the importance of criticism it helps things get better we don’t need to be complacent
lets be honest here the movie was horrible  the movie was poorly structured  there shouldn't be jokes after every serious moment and none of the jokes land  thor is a bumbling buffoon and not the hero we want  Only good thing was Gorr and he wasn't given enough screen time
The entire sequence of Shadow Realm was great
I'm a huge thor fan and a MCU apologist. A massive dumb MCU fan. I don't think a single MCU film is below a 60/10. Saying all that, this is the worst MCU film by far! This is not the thor we should be getting after his arc in infinity war and endgame. You're telling me that a character that was shown to walk to open areas before calling the bifrost, now all of a sudden calls it even in a building full of people? This should be a more mature thor who even acts more mature when he sees how all the other gods react. And what a garbage movie to use gorr and the necro sword, one of the most powerful weapons in the whole MCU! This movie is a hot mess with horrible comedy and makes a mochary on everything these characters have been through
This film honestly did feel like we needed that extra screen time with Gorr…I mean come on they have time to leave Matt Damon in their but not enough time for a key character
I see you getting close to 2mil. Just want to give you an early congrats.
Visual effects and actors can’t save a bland, boring movie.
I feel like Shelby Oaks went from crowdsourcing to post production very quickly
The review resonates. I was confused by this movie as well.
Where you been at bro ? You have not been making no reviews lately
Love and Thunder was pure bad. They went way too overboard with the comedy.
My main compliant with the last Thor was everything was a joke. Nothing mattered.  Entire civilization destroyed, and Korg makes a joke.. No stakes, nothing matters
Taika is just not a good filmmaker and he's a bit too self obsessed. People give his lackluster filmmaking a pass because he's "funny" and "quirky", but when he's constantly making jokes about being lazy, making fun of his own film's edit and VFX, gay baiting a non gay movie, it's just all about Taika. It rubs me the wrong way a lot that has come out with the marketing of this movie and the press junket with him.
Maybe stop playing onset and actually create a movie
Thought this movie was a lot of fun. Felt like a cartoon. I feel like we’ve had 3 other Thor movies at this point, we don’t need to make big steps in his character arc at this point. I wanted to see Thor and his friends do some cool shit and make me laugh and I got that, so I’m happy.
I'm not to sure why you feel like not saying you don't like a movie. I don't make movies so I really can't say you're wrong, but I have made art and felt like I shouldn't say anything that might be constructive or opinionated, but I know not to take it to far.
I’m not sure why Fiege signed off on this movie…
Where’s the stranger things review?
Apparently they were forced to condense this film down to 2 hours and had to cut A LOT out of it. Christian Bale during interviews was talking about scenes cut from the film. Yeah it’s just one big mess
I think some of the disjointed narrative can be summed up by way of the fact that it's technically Korg telling the story.
The movie was okay
So basically spiderman is carrying phase 4
I can't say I enjoyed Love and Thunder at all. Felt like Thor took a humongous step backward in his character development as if none of his growth inprevious movies ever happened
As a film critic it’s kind of your job to talk about the bad  films
Chris why didn’t you review the eternals and morbius
This is the first and only marvel film I decided to listen to spoiler talk on, particularly Jeremy Jahns’ review, and I was left scratching my head about the decisions made and I hadn’t even seen the film.
Please review minions rise of gru
This movie was just entertaining-ish. Nothing memorable (which you could say for like 95% of MCU movies/TV shows).  Infinity War (timeframe) Thor has been the best representation imo, building off of what the prior movies showed us.  I don't think Marvel can be as bad/sink as low as what WB/DC gave us, but Phase 4 overall has been pretty disappointing, to me. It's just milking the revenue streams to the max
More wokeness.  Pass.
The Boys..?
Guardians OTG should have come in for the final act, not the first
Lets be real, MCU is boring and without a thread of original thought. The plotlines read like the fevered attempts of a 3rd grader reading a book report on a book he did not read. We could have bought homes for over a thousand homeless people with the movies budget but no we get another stellar pile of sh*t from Disney and another underwhelming performance form Tessa Thompson. Well done all involved, now off to your summer homes in the Tuscan Valley.
I really am going to miss not seeing Chris' Hilariocity reviews.
This movie was a steaming pile of shit.
Tessa Thompson is always annoying in movies, and Taika publicly disparaging VFX artists was a really crap thing to do.
We get it bro.. You a filmmaker and you empathize with the people working on the movie.. But it’s affecting the reviews. If it’s bad it’s bad. The 2 minute justification and pity party for the filmmakers is unnecessary
No Way Home was Barely a MCU project
The best compliment I can give is: It's better than The Eternals.
I think the cast and director held back their frustration with Marvel. They were mandated to keep the movie under 2 hours. I don't think this is Kevin Feige's fault. It's upper management's fault. And I blame Bob Chapek for it
Christian Bale deserves better than this. Casting a legend like Bale in the mickey mouse club flicks is the same as ordering filet mignon to go along with your happy meal.
MCU as  an whole had went down hill big time. It is nothing as it once was. This movie sucks(in my opinion) . I used to love Thor alot.i will not watch another Thor movie again.
Dark World > Love & Thunder. Outside of Christian Bale scenes this was horrible
Chris just likes everything now.
Does anyone else feel like things are moving way too fast in the latest Marvel movies? They establish entire characters arcs in the space of 90 seconds, and characters are visiting completely different set pieces every 5 minutes - was it always like that?
Jesus. Thor Ragnarok is everything BUT one of my favorite MCU movies and the non-stop humour annoyed the shit out of me, so I guess, "Love and Thunder" (sigh) won't be my thing.
I went in with a low expectation due to other reviews and really loved it. I thought it was a step up from ragnarok in many ways. The cheesy ness and humor worked for me
I was honestly disappointed in this movie and I didn’t think you were gonna review and it’s surprises me that you were honest. Not only the structure falls flat, it felt rushed. I heard that some scenes were cut from the movie with Jeff Goldblum, Peter Dinklage and Lena Headey. Greatfully for Goldblum I want to see more of him. I like seeing these characters very entertaining. Christian Bale was really good but I wanted more of him bc he was unutilised. I still think Ragnarok was better than this and I hope they make another as long they do great
Hearing Christian Bale talk in an interview about how the work of Aphex Twin and Chris Cunningham's collaborations inspired his portrayal of Gorr, and then hearing Thor say "Come to Daddy" in the film, was a nice treat. Though I did hope to see a direct reference to RDJ album's cover in a shot at some point.
I just can’t help but feel like this is a movie that really has no reason for existing. It feels very inconsequential in the grand scheme of the MCU, and it honestly feels like a Disney+ special at times. Very thin plot
I’m gonna keep it simple: the film was ass.
Plant* you don't build a tree.
Christian Bale wiped the floor with everyone. He was acting 3 levels above everyone around him, and it was obvious everyone was running to catch up.  People are asking for a Gore movie not because it was written well, but because it was acted so well. Bale can polish a turd. Seriously.
Man I found this film awful. It's just boring. Pretty much done with the MCU stuff. I know it's fairly clear what to expect going in but this film just wasn't interesting at all.l
This movie was underwhelming! Thor should have been more serious. Gorr should have had way more scenes and more fighting and story arc. The beginning scene should have been more intense. The story itself just wasn’t it, and could have been much better! Russos brothers could direct a beast Thor movie since fat Thor is gone now.
Omg again with the movie promotion instead of the review ... Skipped so many reviews due to this shite
The one marvel movie I won't pay for
As long as Wolverine and Doctor doom are done correctly all else doesn’t matter to me!
I feel like phase 4 projects are about as good as phase 1 which is a far cry from pretty much all of the phase 3 projects. It seems like between the 3 movies and 4 disney+ series a year, they are having difficulty maintaining quality as resources are stretched thin. I think the same care is there as before but the time isn't.
This movie is a prime example of why we need DC.
The problem with Disney is that they keep puking movies and shows every month… at the rate they’re going, you’re bound to become stale
Hot take: I find there’s not much to take away from Chris Stuckmann reviews anymore. He just doesn’t say much for 5 to 9 minutes. Says how he feels, uses generic reasoning very quickly, doesn’t go into hardly any details, doesn’t use any interesting logic or anything, and just sounds monotone the whole time. This was more of a casual discussion about Marvel rather than a review of the film. I feel Chris has gotten worse over time at reviewing films. Like his heart just isn’t in it any more and he’d rather be making movies than reviewing them anymore. Which is fine. But it’s noticeable how poorly structured his current reviews are now and how he doesn’t really say anything of real merit for 9 minutes then calls it good.
I was expecting Sif to play a bigger role. I thought there would be a payoff to her feelings for Thor that were revealed in Dark World. Thor would see her in a new light having gotten over Jane. I mean in comics AND Norse mythology, they end up together. Even in that one storyline, Sif and Thor have a daughter, Torunn, who becomes part of the Young Avengers. She could have been the kid who Thor takes care of at the end.  With Jane, I thought they would create a dynamic with her & Thor that wasn’t based on romance but mutual respect and friendship. I know that in comics recently Jane and Sam (Captain America/Falcon) have become a thing. I know, I know “comics this, comics that”, but the MCU is based off comic book storylines and it has indeed adapted many many plot aspects from comics.  Jane could have been part of the next generation of Avengers along with Thor, Sam, Bucky, Dr. Strange, etc. Well she most likely will return which brings me to the next point…  The deaths: Korg don’t die, Zeus don’t die, even though we saw them be killed. This makes the audience not take death seriously. If a character dies in fiction, we should feel some sort of way for him/her, but instead you think “oh they’ll come back later meh”. For example, when Valkyrie got injured, you would think “oh no! I hope she’s ok” but instead you think “eh she’ll be fine”.  Overall, too much jokes to take a moment seriously. It would be better if the jokes were actually funny but most of them just didn’t land. I know it wasn’t just me because my theater would just not laugh either. In the beginning sure, but it gradually became silent. I literally heard one guy sigh at one point. And serious scenes would just be interrupted with a joke. Jane destroys a sink and has a talk with Valkyrie…nope gotta put in the Bluetooth speaker joke. Gorr is dying and meets his god…nope, the god gotta contradict the feel of the scene with funny sass.  Too little character development. The pace was just scene after scene with no room to digest. The audience doesn’t have time to care for a character/moment because they’re already being thrown into the next scene.   However, Christian Bale did amazing with what he was given though. He was the standout in my eyes. He needed more screen time. Ok I’m done lol
We thought it was great! This movie is pretty stand alone.
If this film was more serious, like Winter Soldier, it would have been 100x better. What a wasted potential in Christian Bale.  Speaking of Marvel, use the parallel universes to bring back a good version of Thanos, another amazing character that could use more screen time.
Your intro music is like a knife to my ears
Movie was ok, Ragnorak was better though.
Review “Brian and Charles” and “The Sea Beast”
A cancer comedy...this was a dumpster fire
Also, VFX artists don't have a union. If they're working overtime, which they often do, they don't get paid OT. And often, they get laid off after the project is over.
I don't know how I feel about this film🙈😔 and it's personal...I could go into such details about how I fell in love with Christian Bale💖 in The prestige !! Or how I absolutely adored Natalie Portman in Leon 💖 !! I really truly want to go see it..but the fact that the big ugly C is involved hits too close to home.. Take Care All 💄🖤💎💜⚡❤🎠🌈🌷💕🥂
this movie's garbage
Chris!!! This movie sucks and YOU KNOW IT
The problem with Gorr is that he's supposed to be threatening, and we get to the see the aftermath of what he did, but you don't get to see him do it, aside from brief event in the beginning.
It’s like Disney isn’t trying hard anymore. It’s a disappointment some shots were literally copied from Thor comic panels but the comic is still more epic than the movie. And the greenscreen effects is like a sore thumb. The Godbutcher is under utilized given an amazing source material. Such a waste for good actors like Natalie Portman and Christian Bale.
Either myself and the audience who watched the opening showing (Dayton, Ohio) are a strange anomaly that happened to show up at the same movie theater at the same time, AND we all were greatly disappointed, OR many YouTube channels with large number of subscribers are major propaganda outlets for the MCU! As a very long time Marvel Comic book fan, AND A Bigtime MCU Fan, this movie was Horrible on many Levels! In general it was extremely (B-Movie level) Hokey, Predictable and more like a parody . The visual effects was super bright and somewhat cheezy, and the hyper-rushed and crammed multi-layered stories/plots made the final product seem like a 3 movie trilogy squeezed into a 30-minute sitcom! There was no real drama (and it clearly should have been), no heart-wrenching twists, no cliffhanger moments worthy of even PG-10 level rating. The few decent humorous moments were cluttered with annoying attempts of forced "corny-dad-humor." As I stated earlier no one, I mean absolutely no one clapped at the end of the movie, no cheering and moist eyes during it either. It literally felt like an additional 10 minutes would have caused a massive walkout before it ended.
This is definitely a Disney thing Fiege has lost the iron gripe he’s had on his Marvel projects ever since Bob Chapek helmed the ship and we’re starting to see some of that seep through.
Christian Bale ruined the film by stealing the whole show even in thought during scenes he were not in.
I just realize that the 4 Batman movies from the 90s and the 4 Thor movies from the MCU have a lot in common   The 1st movie (Batman / Thor) was a good introduction to the hero with one of the best movie villains of all time. And the villain falls to his death at the end..  The 2nd movie (Batman Returns / Thor The Dark World) had a much more dark tone with a love story that doesn't work out in the end, and you think the anti villain working with the hero dies but revealed that they survived as the credits role.   The 3rd movie (Batman Forever / Thor Ragnarok) gets a different director and makes the franchise more colorful and comedic, and has a villain that wears green and another with a burned face. And also teams up with someone that is green. Also the death of a father that motivates them to fight.   The 4th movie (Batman and Robin / Thor Love And Thunder) has the same director as the 3rd and takes that comedic tone to another level that it makes the entire movie look like a Saturday morning cartoon and the outfits look more like toys rather than armor. Plus has a female version who suddenly gets the same powers with no training, but able to fight with the suit on.
I have the same thoughts but my local cinema are clapping for this and Dominion.
Nearly at 2 Million. Congratulations
6 minutes of review and the rest is just you talking smack. I miss when you used to make reviews the whole video since you started till u end it. I don’t want to lose 3 minutes seeing you talk about a sponsor or just you talking smack. It truly bothers me. I guess I have to watch other peoples reviews since you been slacking off lately. Gotta unsubscribe. Bye
The way he goes about not wanting to to sh1t on films and is in the industry, sounds like you should quit reviews entirely, you are embarrassing yourself at this point, between this and the obi wan review, you are ruining any little credibility you had.  I am now certain this guy is a hack a hypocrite and a shill. Hope he fails with his movie he is protecting the same people that are ruining everything just so he doesn't get blacklisted. Also f off with your displate and start giving honest reviews about some of the worst "products" that have passed through the silver screen  lately.
Don’t love the movie, but don’t hate it either. But I find for Taika Waititi movies it takes several viewings to let the humor sink in. It’s like this w Boy, or what we do in the shadows, and also Ragnorok. Some of this humor just flies over my head the first time round. Hopefully when Love and Thunder comes out on Disney+ I get to rewatch it again.
I genuinely enjoyed this movie A LOT!!! Of course Ragnarok was better. But this was such a GREAT time.
I get that Shelby Oaks occupies you a whole lot, but that said I am still surprised by the movies you do choose to review with your limited capacity. No wonder the Northman had bad box office if not even movie fans find time to see and promote it.
Wait...you're making a film called Shelby Oaks?
Glad to see your take on it. I heard there was possibly some sort of mandate put on Taika to make this film 2 hours or less. I think there was some issues with the production of this film whether those fall on Taika or not I can't say for sure. But being a huge Taika fan, and Ragnarok fan I thought this didn't quite feel like his work through and through. It's very messy, unlike anything else he's ever made.
“Visually Dazzling”…???  You can’t be serious.  I’m hoping a body language expert watching this vid and points out all the times you’re being deceptive.
Meh movie 6/10
I totally agree; the whole film felt off for me. I didn’t dislike it, but it left me feeling wanting. The story felt disjointed and Gorr felt underutilized. Apparently there’s characters that filmed and were pulled out. I feel that’s story plot that was needed to make the film feel bigger than it ultimately was.
More than 2 min to get to the review? 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I fear Disney/Marvel will only consider the box office returns and assume that this is the tone that works for this particular franchise (it's not).  I did a lot of yawning during this one...
Still waiting on your review of The Northman!… one of the more interesting films this year.. when you find the time of course 👍🏻
Terrible movie crappy jokes sloppy screen writing and filmmaking This thing is gonna take a huge nose dive in its 2nd week
They destroyed Hulk in Phase 3, now they're after Thor to ruin.
Really interesting to hear about the creative process of your movie, I’m an artist and know the feeling you described but I always try to remember, never judge an unfinished drawing, It’s all a process
I think a lot of people can’t put their critical brain away and enjoy things.
Why does everyone rate Ragnarok so highly? I thought it was just as good as the average MCU movie. Maybe I just don't prefer comedies that aren't incredibly dark like Burn After Reading, Fight Club, A Serious Man, In Bruges, The Boys and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Misouri, other than Wolf of Wall Street, which is also really adult, just in a more raucous way than in a dark way...
Watching the film it felt like Taika was trying to make a Monty Python Marvel movie...not what I expected, and fell flat with me. Shame because like Chris I really enjoyed the previous Thor outing,
I think Korg had more screentime than Thor. They didn't show Gorr as an actual threat. I am so disappointed, I really wanted this to be on the same level as Ragnarok. MCU not doing very well recently.
You don’t have to talk about your movie in every review you do…..
Korg looked pretty bad in this film compared to the other films he's in
It amazes me that people can't seem to point out that Natalie Portman is a bad actress.
I’ve seen Thor Love and Thunder 3 times!! I liked seeing the guardians of the galaxy and Matt Damon!
A funny movie..but very disappointing in many areas..goofy is one thing..but stupid is quite another thing. The worst of the four movies..and #2 was bad. There were 14 people in my theatre.
I didn’t like Ragnarok at all so I can only anticipate I’ll hate this one :(
When are we getting our live-action Legend of Zelda??
Is Marvel getting complacent ?
Yeah, I think so far Phase 4 is by far the weakest one; primarily because I feel it lacks the tonal diversity of the previous phases, which really celebrated the multiculturalism of style and genres from the comics. By contrast, every film in Phase 4 feels tonally and structurally interchangeable, without that diverse nuance that made the series great to begin with.
This movie should have been as long as The Dark Knight. If they wanted to get the story Right.
Chris could you review RRR(rise roar revolt)
This marvel phase has really been quantity over quality. Some of the movies and shows deserved more time for the writing than was given
It's funny that normally I agree with Chris but this time for me it's the complete opposite. I didn't really enjoy Ragnarok but I'm certainly looking forward to see Love & Thunder again.
i liked the second half of Love and Thunder. the first half had so many unnecessary jokes no-one laughed at, i just wanted them to move the plot forward instead of spending time on that stuff. i did however laugh a lot, and i did enjoy Jane and Thor's relationship. it was a solid 6,5/10
Look like they start doin Thor same thing they do to hulk...just make him a bitch
Thor is a clown, the movie was terribly unfunny.
Chris Stuckmann  You're probably one of my favorite reviewer's and this video was proof.  I don't think I always agree with the movies you love, but I think there's some middle ground.  I loved Thor Ragnarok and that's one of the Marvel movies I can constantly go back to, laugh, and enjoy it over and over again  That being said  I actually really enjoyed Thor Love and Thunder and have seen it twice already.  Loved the scene with Thor meditating and saving the Guardians  Loved the humor  Actually really like Jane Foster's story/reason for becoming the mighty Thor  Loved the scene explaining Thor and Jane's relationship  Loved the scene with the gods/Russel Crowes performance as Zeus  Loved Christian Bale as Gor  I know you pointed out the marketing,. saying not all gods have a plan  But that's part of what made this movie so great and opened it up for humor  Half, if not MOST of the humor in this movie and Ragnarok would not work... If Chris Hemsworth played Thor as a straight man/having a plan  It works with Thor kinda being an idiot/thinking he's got together when he doesn't  That is when I actually can get behind him and find him more interesting than the guy that always knows what he's doing  If you tried to play the level of humor off in another Marvel movie .. I don't think it would work   In Thor and what Taki has done... It's a masterstroke and I think the best fit, and Chris Hemsworth just sells it for me  The ONLY thing I didn't like about this movie  Gor not being shown killing other gods... This isn't a HUGE complaint, because it is Marvel and also a family movie. But I think they could've found a 0g-13  way of getting it done  The Korg thing ie his father's ie him not finding a female to be with  Valkerie not being into dudes  Zeus's lighting bolt not being MORE powerful  The actor they got for Hercules... Could not be a WORSER choice  He's short and skinny  Funny... I thought Hercules was supposed to be tall and buff  My mistake Kevin Fiege hahahaha  Final consensus  I'm not sure I liked this as much as Thor Ragnarok, but it's dang close  Oh hahaha   And I loved/disliked the goats haha they were funny and annoying at the same time  I'm confused on their marketing too   Like almost like the media and stars/director are trying to see if they can deture people for some reason  I'm glad, I didn't listen to the naysayers   I was so DISAPPOINTED with Dr Strange multiverse of madness, that I was like.... Seriously  Another bad movie   But Thor Love and Thunder was a MILLION times better than Dr. strange multiverse of madness  Why would Taiki and Tessa Thompson tear down the CGI?  Unless it was a joke  But that's a weird joke/almost insulting  I thought the CGI/special effects were amazing and don't know why people criticize   Other movies... Not so good sometimes  But Marvel makes every scene just look amazing  Like a live action Pixar movie
I freaking loved this movie.  I can understand why some people didn't enjoy it but it feels like almost universally people are Meh in it.  Aside from Loki it's the best the MCU has offered me in phase 4 and it might be in the top 5 overall for the MCU.  While I'd probably take a longer directors cut with more Gorr, Mighty Thor, and Guardians I really appreciated the sub 2hr runtime and the straightforwardness of the entire story.  Oh well.  Hopefully Taika gets to make about one and gets to keep doing his thang because I'm totally here for it.
Considering I'm pretty sure Comics-Gorr is powerful enough to be the next thanos, I was massively disappointed that he was defeated and killed in this movie. I know a lot of comic characters are nerfed in the mcu, but while I liked mcu Gorr he was way weaker than I was hoping
I went into it knowing what was said about the film, and how it veered way more towards the humorous route, but came out enjoying it overall. It's definitely not as good as Ragnarok but I think it's better than his first two films. At least the second one for sure. I do hope they take him in a more serious route moving forward though, cause this tone will wear out its welcome and it's time they gave the character a more dramatic and weighty presence.
Gorr is suppose to butcher gods, but the only god butchered was Thor’s character.
Better than the first two movies but not as good as Ragnarok, I miss the synthwave soundtrack from Ragnarok
They stopped caring altogether.. apart from money of course
Bro love the shirt ❤️
Hey nice shirt there
Let's face it... Thor died in the beginning of End Game when he killed Thanos...marvel should have buried him then and there.
The amount the actors and creators have been subtly shit talking this movie has been really off putting, especially when talking about how much content was cut for the movie and the planning process behind the story and structure.
Thor 5 needs to be like infinity war
Great review, Chris. Excited for Shelby Oaks
I am very interested to see what the extended cut is like. I wonder if they cut a lot of scenes because the VFX weren’t finished in time and that’s why they’ve mentioned it in the press. Most of the recent Marvel projects feel like they should have been delayed.
lets not forget the message "white men are bad"
Gorr was the best part of this movie. And the story had some great ideas and great scenes. But it was so scatterbrained and so fast-paced and lighthearted that I never felt like any of those ideas had time to really get fleshed out. I was entertained but then the movie ended and I thought “eh, okay. That was fun but kind of unnecessary.”
I haven’t seen review yet but I bet you didn’t like it cuz of the tone
Always on point man. 💯
Marvel is starting to give the fans quantity over quality and sadly it is dividing the fans so much in phase 4 still I enjoyed thor 4 but it is something forgetable
The movie was really really bad
This movie is shit in a gold trashbag
I thought this movie was just ok. It’s my least favorite thor movie in the series. Ragnarok is better in all aspects.
Thor reached his peak at Infinity/End Game. Love and Thunder is good but is way too much of a comedy.
The film just comes off super rushed, heavily cut of character development & emotional pause, too much humor and so many missed opportunities in terms of phase 4 with all the new concepts & a lot less collective cohesion. It’s not confirmed, but I feel like the studio pushed script concepts & extreme cuts like Lena Headey’s $7.5 million role & scenes and overly relied on CGI when practical effects & sets would have given us dimensions more. Add to that Feige has stretched himself to thin.
I also absolutely loved Ragnarok, and it's very disappointing that this seems to be getting universally less praise. Then again, Eternals was ripped apart as the "worst MCU movie" and I really liked that, so we'll see what I think when I actually see it.
5:29 Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness*
The only movie can save marvel now is - guardians of the galaxy 3
I just saw thor love and thunder yesterday. I thought it was funny had a dark villain, it was emotional to me and had a good backstorty and tragic for gor
But Chris...that is why you should do reviews of films you didn't like; from a filmmaker's perspective. Some of us may appreciate that. Just a thought.
why hes stop rating the movies ?!
it was a feminist lgbtq rainbow  colour drenched film none of the women were the butt of any jokes the jokes were on thor a straight white male,it was supposed to be HIS film not janes and valkyres...its got nothing to do with effects its about entertainment(beavis and butthead do the universe)......it wasnt about thor it was about promoting jane,female thor for marvels women phase nobody is interested in their far left feminist crap so they use legacy characters to shoe horn it in,but it still doesnt work and they still dont get it
So many of these reviews start with something along the lines of "you know, I really liked Ragnarok..." it says a lot.
The choices made in this movie were questionable. They played it off like a kids movie, then included the only nudity you'll ever see in a Marvel movie. And it was gratuitous.    The cgi shadow mosters were just lazy vfx. Most of the cgi looked substandard. Most the cgi looked like Superman's mustache had been removed.
I always wondered why you don't critique movies . Interesting
Late out of date review
I feel like Ragnarok had a very classic 3-act structure: can our heroes prevail; no the obstacle (Hella) is too overwhelming; they overcome nonetheless (by changing the win conditions). As much as I enjoyed Love & Thunder, it doesn't seem to have a structure of any kind. What should have been the main story (Gorr) was instead treated as a backdrop for other stories. Those other stories weren't built upon any kind of structure, no rising tension followed by release. The script was like a 5 year old telling a story: "This happened, then this happened, then this happened, then this happened." Each individual thing that happened is interesting, but there's no structure behind it.
I really hope Disney allows a Gorr cut of this film with the additional Gorr stuff put in.
OK great review Chris. 👍 Love you 😍 Rock your ink 🖋🥓🥗🧚‍♂️🪄✌️😢✌️
Sorry, I like this film better than Ragnarok. Dead wrong, dude.
As someone who LOVED this film, I feel like it was a really good draft, in that I enjoyed everything I got within reason, however I know it could've been a better film overall (Still a 10 for me in terms of pure, mad enjoyment though haha)
It's style of comedy for the first half of the film almost felt like it was insulting me for wanting to care about "a classic Thor adventure" before giving me a second half that gives us exactly that in an ironic manner. The dramatic and serious moments and elements were cool, but it rang completely hollow after going out of its way to make fun of the characters and their premises themselves and laughing at me for caring in the first place. I like a number of Waititi's other movies, and I really liked parts of this, but the comedy in so much of this movie almost felt a bit mean-spirited toward the audience from a meta perspective. I really wanted to like this, but I really didn't... I really think Waititi is just one of those auteur creators who us vest working on original films, because I really don't want to see him back for whatever is next for Thor, and if this kind of stuff is what we have to expect, I loathe to see what he'll do with his Star Wars project.
Stay strong through production, Chris! We're rooting for you! 🤟
Bro what are you trying to say? I just watched 10min of a man saying literally nothing
Loved the MCU, not a fan of the new MD+U.
I honestly thought this was one of the worst superhero movies I've seen. Shit felt like batman at robin at times on a massive budget...
Visually it was great to me. I enjoyed it and more in some areas than others. I heard Hemsworth saying how great of an actor Bale is and it makes you want to work harder bug yet I felt like they didnt show enough of him. I wanted darker from him. I felt like it needed another 20-30 minutes of material. The only big disappointment for me was that I was hoping to see more characters introduced like Beta Ray Bill
Dude u have become an excuse artist the ten rings was garbage!
They wasted Christian Bale so badly. I’m surprised he took/backed this project the way it came out. But hey, I’m sure he got a sweet payday out of it!
I did a review on this movie
Christian Bale was the best actor for me. I felt like he wasn't given enough screentime.
If Ragnarok was a 9, Love and Thunder is like an 8.5. I don't know what movie the people who say this is some big drop-off saw.
They threw away all of Thor's character growth.   I understand the decision not to shit on your own industry.  But, let's not pretend it's anything more than a financial choice.
Gonna keep this simple, I love Taika. But he should never touch the guardians again. Leave that to James Gunn. Thor needs to be over with, and we’re seriously cutting out parts of Gorr for what? If we’re gonna let Sam Raimi go crazy, keep that energy for everyone you have working on your films.
Chris I know you said you weren't going to talk negatively about films anymore, but it seems like you're going halfway with your review here. You didn't really talk about the movie and what did or didn't work for you while awkwardly  focusing on the film's marketing. A weird review.  love ya, excited for your movie
I wasn't too fond of the children plotlines and the tonal shifts.   It's pretty clear Gorr was substantially cut out of the film and I find that disappointing.  I was fully expecting Gorr to slaughter a bunch of gods in this film but we really don't get to see any of that.  I loved everything with Jane but I feel the plotline was rushed.  I am excited to see what they do with Hercules but I am still on the fence about Love.
Badass shirt!
“Not every god has a plan” are they talking about Thor or Kevin Feige?
This film reeks of studio interference and control over the story. It’s not that Taika Waititi can’t make a bad film, but honestly a lot of this film didn’t feel like it was his. And every single film he’s made has had that feeling. I think Waititi wanted to make something else more focused on faith and love and Marvel didn’t want it. They rushed him and he was busy with other projects that he was way more passionate about. During press for this film he’s seemed more excited to talk about Our Flag Means Death than the film he’s there to interview for. Marvel takes these smaller-ish, more indie directors, strips them of their personality over time, and leaves them exhausted. I also can’t imagine seeing the MCU butcher Thor’s character in IF and Endgame and having to move on from that.
Gorr should had been in a Mighty Thor movie that had Jane as the main character, and with a different director. I'm kinda missing Branagh's style.
ALREADY KNOW THIS SHILL WILL GIVE IT A POSITIVE SCORE.....TYPICAL OF A SELLOUT.
I loved the movie. It actually made me laugh and cry but yes, Ragnarok is still better. My issue is more on the pacing and length. The jokes arent as slapstick now and are more inside jokes but they still sorta come at wrong times and doesnt give serious scenes enough time to breath. Like when the kids were taken, we didnt dwell long enough on the parents' worries since we immediately cut to theater Thor and Loki wanting to write a play bout it.   There is also the issue of not giving Gorr much scenes. Aside from that Christian Bale is an awesome actor, they made his character unintentionally sympathetic. I feel if they showed his kills on screen and the effects, we would actually think him getting defeated be a good thing. Aside from Thor, so far the gods weve seen onscreen are obnoxious uncaring jerks that it gives makes Gorr's argument that all of them dying to be sorta reasonable idea in turn.    The planet where they found the god Falligar slain, Thor mentioned he's a nice guy. It would've really been nice to see Falligar is no jerk and see his battle with Gorr and it's aftermath (Now he's gone, no one is doing his job and his people are no longer protected) so to point out even if Gorr's sympathetic, he's in the wrong.    The movie is only 2 hours which is strange because Ragnarok was longer. I feel if they were given more time, they wouldve been able to add more important scenes and give existing important scenes more time to breath. But maybe something happened and they decided to just keep one part in exchange for a shorter run time.   The last post credit scene though is very much deserved.
Gorr was the best part of the movie for me! I also thought that Jane's inclusion and their relationship ended really well. The biggest problem I had with the movie though was with the comedy. So many of the jokes for me just fell flat which resulted in a cringey viewing experience for me. Overall I was super disappointed!
Wtf. Ragnarok was good. Why would anyone watch it more than MAYBE twice is a mystery.
*Agree with almost everythin,* Ragnorak had a better balance in tone. I didn't dislike this movie but didn't love it.  Shang-Chi and No Way Home were phenominal but the rest have fallen a little flat.
Chris: I grew up with Marvel comics. But as a director Thor was too fun and not like Top Gun or a drama film. Something about “movies aren’t like they used to be”, Im gonna give it a C-!
Sorry but Ragnarok wasn't for me, there are cool things in it but too much comedy and wasted characters and story lines. My biggest issue Hulk.
Gorr was wasted in this kid friendly film. Wish we saw more violence really...
Ass. The movie was complete ass. It clearly wasn’t written by people who actually like the character.
so you're only reviewing movies you like now? whats the point of this channel?
Terrible movie
Video 99 Metropolis review request   (?)
I loved this movie. It's clearly not perfect, but Christian Bale as Gorr was freaking amazing, and the whole humor thing was fine to me. Thor was using humor to avoid getting into another serious loving relationship with someone. It was always part of his character, but it became so more and more, especially when he lost Jane. When this movie needed heart, or serious moments, I felt like Thor's character rose to the challenge and made me feel what I needed to feel, and I didn't feel like the humor of the movie took away from that.
I believe someone, at leas one person should have made sure that the production of this film was going in a right direction and kept Taika's ambitious and vision in check.
The movie felt like 2 movies condensed into one. With the Guardians, Thor dealing with grief and loss, the backstory with Jane and how many gods Gorr killed it needed to be two movies.
I really need your shirt pretty awesome
I didn’t like the movie at all . It’s unnecessary comedy now . Thor is the biggest dumbass and all the women are smart and level headed . I get women empowerment but dude they ruining characters left and right now . They did so with dr strange now Thor . Mcu is trash now
This is the second film Marvel has forced cuts onto their movies. The rumored run time for Strange 2 was far from what we got and it made sense when we were told a lot of the run time was trimmed off
Thor: Love and Thunder is really good! I agree Ragnarok is better.
Thor and Hulk became the Dan Hibiki's of the MCU.
The whole MCU phase 4 was trash
My contention with this movie is that it feels like a forced entry to fill gaps between other projects. That said, it feel like a movie that otherwise doesn't really serve a purpose. It isn't doing anything to the bigger picture or bringing us closer to the next big bad, it feels like this movie only exists to do Jane justice.
Starts at 2:13
Disney owes us the 4hr directors cut
Thank you so very much for this! Heard a lot of rumors that the movie felt Rush, but it's okay hopefully they learn next time.. 👊👊
I loved Ragnarok, but somehow I have no desire to go and see this, will give it a watch when it hits Disney+...
I thot they joked to much in this movie...i felt let down like Thor did hen he met zeus...& those irritating screaming goats were annoying...but Yes i would watch again & again b/c i love the MCU
Marvel is dying
I heard there was a longer Director CUT ✂️
Man you are reviewing this but you have not yet reviewed Elvis man , c'mon waiting for your review of Elvis.
movie had plot holes
I miss when he covered bad movies but he needs to kiss Hollywood’s ass and get on their good side.
My main problem with phase 4 is that there doesn't seem to be any over arching story they're working towards. So it feels very directionless to me.
We appreciate that you keep it real 💯
I hated Zeus in this movie! Especially after seeing Zeus fighting Darksied in ZSJL. Taika Watiti is suffering from lack of criticism from media outlets and critics. Never understood why they treat him like he’s Hollywood darling
The gags were stretched too far. Bale is an amazing actor and his talent was wasted.
Chris, the MCU is dead. They will continue to make money (already less than before) for maybe a couple of years, but they are done. They are taking a completely different direction than in the past, focusing on everything except storytelling. This movie marks the last time i''ve spent money for the MCU.
I'm just so done and burned out on Marvel. I was kinda already burned out on it even ten years ago.
I get it. You are making movies now so you have to play nice. But I have been watching you for years and I KNOW you know this movie sucks.
Only serious scene I saw Thor have was at the end when Jane told him about her cancer. He needs to be little less comedic
If you haven't seen this movie, just wait for it to drop at D+.
Your attempt at becoming a filmmaker has hurt your reviews. You held back on this one.
I thought this movie was fucking horrible.
I have been dissapointed with Phase 4 movies that I will not go and see Thor 4. My predictions came true for this movie that I lost any hype for this movie.  The Batman is far superior than just about all their phase 4 movies combined.   I am now worried about Black Panther 2
This is an interesting case where as a whole or retrospectively, I’d argue it’s pretty bad, but in the moment, I was having a blast. Some comedy didn’t work but I was mainly thinking- this works.
Will you be reviewing Stranger Things Season 4? I’d love to hear your thoughts
Hhmm.  Interesting.  ~_~
Gorr made one of those "surprise guest appearances" like you see in tv shows
Supposedly the movie got mandated to be under 2 hours which SUCKS. I don't think this is coming from Marvel or Feige either. Disney had a huge structural and management shakeup when Chapek took over and Feige has less power now than he did under Iger. I think Disney higher ups are mandating shorter movies and it's affecting then MCU. Doctor Strange felt too short as well.  People have been very vocal about how Disney are bad to work with now under Chapek and I think that's where the weird press is coming from.
I don’t even watch these garbage movies anymore. If it’s something that I’m interested in though I just watch the reviews like this that remind me how smart I was to avoid it in the first place.
If they make another movie like this imma stop going to the theatres to watch these MCU movies.
>Father gone >Mother gone >Homeland gone >Brother gone Thor: "HAHA IT'S HAMMER TIME"   Get us a director that knows the weight of past events please...
Chris, this review sounded like you were in a corporate meeting not giving your real opinion at the risk of jeopardizing your career.  I liked your unfiltered reviews better.  Still love ya !!
I knew you were going to do a review for Thor: Love and Thunder eventually! XD Hope everything’s going great for your post-production for Shelby Oaks :)
Maybe it is I am an Asian who watched so much of kungfu movies but Shang-Chi was not good at all. All those actions scenes are just reused action sequences from any other Chinese movies. Honestly tired of all those dragon stories and ancient stories. I can't speak for other Asians but lot of my friends were tired of the same old stuff. Lot of us just want movies where we are like regular people doing regular stuff.
For crying out loud this movie was garbage!!! It’s almost like you’re looking for anything else to talk about. The plot was garbage, the comedy was way too much. Thor is a buffoon.. this guy ruined this character.
Talk about eating around the bush 😩. Unsubcribed
i absolutely HATED this movie. it took everything i didn’t like from ragnarok (i just thought it was meh) and turned it up to 25. the humor is awful, thor is an idiot, there’s so many plot holes, continuity errors, and inconsistencies, korg is even more annoying than ragnarok, the effects are terrible. only good things were christain bale, natalie portman, and the soundtrack (when it wasn’t only relying on guns n roses). i never want to see taika waititi write or direct an mcu movie ever again.
The Boys: Shows Butcher killing supes.   Invincible: Omni Man killing The Guardians of the Globe and a lot of people  Thor L&T: It's too scary to show it to kids.
QQ: you didn't score this movie because you like the director?
I thought Christian Bale was great as Gorr. I'm so glad they didn't go the CGI route. Bale's performance was creepy and oh so villainous
Brett Goldstein as Hercules?? Awful, awful casting there.
To me, this was the worst Thor movie of them all. Gore did not butcher any Gods throughout the entire movie
The MCU is in a weird place right now. Phases 1-3 had a clear agenda of what was to come with Thanos and the infinity stones that the causal audience could follow. They then had their 2 most popular characters retire from the franchise with their next most popular character being controlled by another movie studio.Then comes the nature of movies in todays society. With movies staying in movie theaters shorter than ever before I feel that could cause movie studios to care less about the quality of the movies they produce.
It's always bothered me how much Thor changed in Ragnarok with very little explanation as to why.
They know they can say absolutely anything and it's still going to make money lol
It would be great to see Director’s Review
Loving that post-production smile. It suits you. I'm super happy for you and your journey as a filmmaker and just a resilient human being. You've shared so much of your life and passions with the world and even setbacks and challenges that most people wouldn't be able to handle so getting to see you at this point is incredibly inspiring. I'll see Love and Thunder at some point but I feel more inclined to watch Ragnarok again after this review! Thanks for the great content, as always!
How woke is Love and Thunder out of 10?
This really felt like an OK movie stuck in between 2 better movies.
Chris,I totally love your T-shirt. Not only was Zelda my favorite game series of all time, but the Orinca of Time has been my favorite of the Zelda games Ive  played so far.
Ive only watched it once but can anyone tell me who killed the first guy who had the necroblade? If it took 2 thors to take gor down, how many did it take to take the first guy down. Thanks!
Huge letdown of a film. Yes, Christian Bale was very good and you understood his motive, but they must have cut out scenes where he actually did some "bad guy stuff" because there was none of it. The humor fell flat for me besides one or two laughs here and there. And I found them constantly repeating the same jokes whether it was the screaming goats or Crowe saying "orgy" over and over again, it's like, we get it dude. I think it would have been cool if they kept Jane's story secret and it's revealed in the film that theres a new mysterious hero and we dont find out who it is until we as an audience see the movie, but then also during the film, we flashback to see how Jane came upon the hammer/revealing her sickness, etc. The movie was just all over the place with structure, plot, devlopment, and in the end, I just didnt care about what I was watching. The Guardians were completely unnecessary and also wasted. It's always a shock to me when they have films where the main characters are ones you already love and care for but the film manages to find a way thru lack of story telling to fall completely flat on its face. The idea of killing a god/gods and the ideas of servitude and faith, etc, would be such a great concept of these stories to explore and even that just didnt come thru. Just a mesy hodge podge of bad humor, lack of character, and action that didnt seem to matter and keep you invested.
To me this movie was... A parody? You guys remember the "Scary Movies"? They were a parody of actual horror movies like The Ring and Scream, and every character in those films was extremely zany and made jokes 24/7. This is Thor Love and Thunder. Having Chris Hemsworth playing 'this' Thor is like having Jennifer Lawrence as 'Kantmiss Evershot' in the Starving Games parody. It's just like that. Only funnier.  And you know what's weird? That this rated-E Deadpool somehow... manages to not be a bad movie.  But it's still unnecessary IMO. You go to the cinema expecting an action-superhero-movie... But you find yourself looking at one of those purposedly cringe theatrical recaps at the beginning of every Thor movie. And it's the whole movie.
Didn't they have a caption at the end of the film that said thor will be back? I hope that means Chris Hemsworth is back and that they're not recasting the character.
I’m genuinely curious: Do many of you consider this guy to be a legitimate movie critic? I ask because even after watching about a dozen or so of his reviews, I get almost nothing from them as he speaks almost exclusively in generalities.
Oh come on.  Rip into this film already. Set your love for the director aside and just rip it. They RUINED Thor’s character arc:
The Boys review pls
Just wanted to say that I really appreciate your shift towards positivity and making videos about films you enjoy. It's an incredibly refreshing and welcomed change, especially in an environment like YouTube where vitriol and negativity regularly run rampant. Definitely proud to still be Stuckmanized.
fuck this movie
I hate how hindsight is 2020
Too much jokes in this movie and they just tried to be funny throughout the whole movie where you feel exhausted.
Soooo can you review The Boys? D: lol
When you don't like a movie... But you GOTTA review it... Cause your afraid of burning future bridges.
When is the Jurassic world:dominion review coming???
This movie was a joke…LITERALLY!
Way too much comedy for me. Thor is just a dumb Jock at this point it's embarrassing. Best bits were the serious stuff and when Bale was on screen, which is only a very small portion of the film.
Please check RRR
The part where Thor yelled out “IT’S THUNDERIN TIME!” Was the greatest scene in the entire movie and definitely made it 20x better than it already was!!🌟
This movie was a very expensive SNL sketch. I could barely tolerate it.
So you’re no longer reviewing movies you thought were bad and focusing on positive ones? That’s absolute ridiculousness. So now you’re just going to shill for movies you like. Why bother watching your videos. Just see if he uploaded and then know the movie was good.
They’re calling this Marvel Phase Bore.
That T-Shirt tho 🔥
what’s up Youngblood, I see U rocking that tri force my dude🙌🤩🙌
Let's say...It was a crappy movie.
I am not sure if you liked it or not but yeah it sucked
I was super pumped for this movie and left the theater feeling pretty disappointed. I will agree that I was entertained but not nearly as much as watching the amazing Ragnarok! I've never been a fan of Natalie Portman so I was super happy when they scrapped her character in Ragnarok and so hugely bummed when they brought her back, I just don't see a reason for that character to be in the Thor story other then having Thor have a love interest, which a cool Marvel character DOESN'T NEED ALL THE TIME!! And her plot line was just super fucking weird and nonsensical in my opinion. Made no god damn sense what was happening! I won't spoil it for anyone but I was not happy about the plot of this movie.. did love the goats though
Thje way you described Taika in his interviews where he cannot be serious for too long without making jokes is exactly how the film played out. If they wanted to use Gor then they needed a badass Thor instead of the dude bro without a clue who relies too much on his friends.
Im done with Mcu and franchises
This is the Batman & Robin of the Thor saga, and the Lady in the Water of Taika Watiti...  This movie is so bad , it ruined Guardians of the Galaxy for me, and I no longer want to see any MCU movies again...
On one hand, I respect Taika for making a goofy space comedy with his friends for the fun of $200 million and not giving an f. On the other hand, I wish they would actually try to make an epic great film like Infinity War. It’s THOR, not Ace Ventura.
For the children... Alot of the cast's kids were in the film. Taika probably G rated the movie a little for the premiere screenings
They also market the movie as the gayest marvel movie and I am shocked Chris didn’t mention that aspect of it. I watched a clown fish video about FX people complaining about working for Disney.
I just did a review on it too. Please go check it out 💕
Where's stranger things 4 review?
Why can't thor be like Kratos??
The reason it didn't "work" is because the subject matter was very very serious. Jane is dying from cancer, kids get kidnapped, we have a god killer, and the tone is still extremely goofy.  It just doesn't match. Its hard to emotionally connect cause the movie didn't want to take its own theme seriously (except for maybe the end?)
Bale could play the joker and kill on the role but you normies arent ready for that yet
Chapek era is going to try and undo everything Feige accomplished. Hopefully I'm wrong.
I’d love to see you review Stranger things season 4
Sorry but Taika sounds like an ass hole for shitting on the VFX artists. This whole phase has been disappointing at best
Three displates for this shi**y movie? Okay then.
I actually enjoyed the movie lol it wasnt as good as i hoped it would be but i still liked it.
From what I can tell, you not wanting to poke fun at bad movies is related to you realizing what it would be like to be at the receiving end of it. The thing is, no one will hold you to a higher standard than a fellow director or a movie critic. The effect and reaction depends on the author, not the critic. Compare the way Tommy Wisseau took all the criticism thrown his way with how M. Night Shyamalan took it. Tommy rolled with it, accepted it, "adopted the meme" and people both like and respect him for it. Shyamalan added whole scenes in his movies just to caricaturize movie critics, and it made him look pretty bad. If something in a film is silly, I think it's fair to point it out. Most film critics don't personally attack the authors, but their works, and that's okay.
I'd do anything to watch a movie again that made me feel the way infinity war did in the middle of watching it and after it was over
This movie is postponed "indefinitely" in my country but like Lightyear, it might as well be banned. Somehow, I don't feel that bad for missing it out and be a pirate.  Seriously what the hell is going on with the MCU? Disney+ shows aside, Phase 4 is so underwhelming. No interest in Black Widow and Eternals, Shang Chi is just fine, Doctor Strange and now Thor are underwhelming, No Way Home is the only movie that's at least good. And I'm just saying this as a casual viewer so comic accuracy is the least of my problem. Like, I really wish the issue is just the 2 years of the pandemic made me extremely cynical.  I feel like the issue has less to do with the MCU or Taika and more towards Disney itself. I mean, it happened with Star Wars and the MCU has been doing relatively well with its previous 3 phases. Plus, the recent issue from former FX artists that worked on Thor.
I’m so glad Chris hasn’t abandoned his reviews. I trust his opinion over most.
I’m in the same boat I’ll probably never watch this again
Saying something sucks isn't an appropriate take but this movie sucks
Yea...this film did feel like a rushed product. Still fun to watch tho. 1 or 2nd time around. So...I guess Thor got his eye back. ? 20/20 vision ?
I feel like we're sort of on the same page with this. I loved Ragnarock, but only somewhat enjoyed Love & Thunder. In a weird twist for an MCU film, I thought the first half was bloated and kinda boring, but the back half was great. Sort of a polar opposite to movies like Shang-Chi and so many others, that have me totally onboard until they turn into CGI explosions & weightless action. Instead of tuning out during the final battle as I often do, that was where I experienced a surprising bit of emotion (even when one of my least favorite Guns N Roses songs, November Rain, kicked in).  I think it was when they showed up at Omnipotence City that the film finally found itself and became engaging. I also really loved Bale as the God Butcher.  Honestly, he wasn't a super interesting villain in an otherwise fantastic run of the comics, but I found Bale's performance to be one of the better I've seen from him in recent years.  And yeah, I'd still love to see another film from this team.
I think Covid really changed the MCU. I think the level of importance people put into the stories, letting them brew for a little over a year before anything new came out, changed the momentum they had. It put a lot more importance into EndGame and made people forget how long it took to get there. Just look at the numbers New Rockstars was doing during the pandemic. They grew a ton even pre-Wandavision. That's all these people who were re-watching the movies and growing a deeper connection to the projects and a level of excitement that just wasn't the same pre-covid. We're not watching movies leading to Infinity War, we're basically back in the new Phase 2 where things are planned, but we don't really have a clue of the final baddie that's being led up to. Not many of those movies were really good back then either.  Another issue is with every new show and new movie, there's new strings attached to each project. Because every movie and show introduces new characters, they're all in different parts of space, and they're all building to new Infinity War-like movies. So they have to introduce new characters, introduce concepts like multiverses for audiences, and then sunset characters for actors who don't want to keep playing them or so they can take a break.   SPOILERS: So this movie had to introduce Gorr's daughter, sunset Natalie Portman's story, give Hemsworth a break, probably had to introduce the concept of the Gods, and push Tessa Thompson further. Not as much as some movies like Multiverse of Madness had to do, but they had goals of this movie they had to meet. So they can only play in that little box. Every single movie that comes out, the box to play in seems smaller and smaller. Can't imagine how they're going to handle Black Panther 2 with no Boseman, no Kaluuya, and the sister being a major Anti-vaxxer on a Hollywood set.
The best part of this movie was the first 5 minutes. Everything after was a convoluted moments setting up the next bad joke. Phase 4 is weak.
this movie suck asss
I completely hear everybody's disappointment in Thor: love and thunder. What you need to do is look at it from a children's movie point of view. When you look at it from that gaze the movie makes complete sense and it's probably going to get a lot of rewatchability on Disney Plus mainly for kids to put it on in the background.
Taika Waititi is one of my favorite writer/directors.  Dude is my type of humor. Loved him ever since 'What We Do In The Shadows'
still waiting for elvis (i know you're busy haha)
Silly and forgettable. In fact the silliest MCU film of them all. A pretty dangerous slide.  James Gunn can blend humour and emotion into a gripping story far, far better. Sure, the MCU Thor is Space Vikings but Taika Waititi seems to be hooked into having more fun pushing the humour beyond funny to the point of pythoneque absurdity rather than telling a compelling story. A pity.
Any plans for stranger things 4?
This is the version of Chris I’ve missed. I miss his honesty about film. Thank you for not only saying what you liked and being real this time.
Yeah phase 4 has been really disappointing, so much content but other than Spiderman, Shang chi and Loki, I haven’t enjoyed anything else
To best summarize the movie for me, first half was mostly dogsh*t with Minions like humor, 2nd half was a pretty decent Thor movie
Maybe it wouldn’t hurt to see it a second time. I know I’ve had knee jerk reactions to movies, but when I see it a second time, I’m able to absorb it better and maybe see stuff I wasn’t paying attention to. I do agree that Christian Bale needed more on screen time, but it was fun ride. I suppose they could have took a bit more time to emotional build up, but I appreciate what they were able to say. There’s an interesting video on Screencrush talking about the wealthy and the poor. I did like the parallels between Jane and Gorr wielding great power at a cost and utilizing it to opposite degrees, but both having strong convictions that what they’re doing is right. I know you’ve already have made up your mind, but it wouldn’t hurt giving it a second chance.
I'm so suprised by the universal criticism. I found this Thor outing lovely - dumb and hollow in all the right ways. Like... not even pretending to be anything more than it is. Every other marvel movie is just as plotholy as this, so I really wonder why the reception this time around is the way it is. Maybe Marvel-overdose after a slew of tv shows that all had their fair share of problems?
It is sad to say but Marvel seems to be cutting back on their movies and shows since the first outings..
Maybe they're rushing to get the kid avengers out? That what I think.  How many kids with superpowers is that now?
Clearly, there should have been an actual script written and Feige should have been reigning Taika in a bit more. You cannot make a movie with serious themes like cancer and faith using continual jokes and slapstick gags.
Chris is back!!! I thought I lost you.  I felt just like you about this movie, I like it but it’s no Ragnarok, maybe the expectation was too high
I'm really tired of only being happy with just aspects of a movie, so mediocre
Yipp this movie is all Taika watiti
Personally, I liked this movie more than the previous, since I've always been a bit more iffy on Ragnarok than most people. I like it well enough, and maybe my opinion will change, but it's really just okay to good, for me. This movie felt more simple with a more straightforward plot than Ragnarok. I think they did Jane Foster much better in this movie than in the first two Thor movies, I chuckled every single time the goats showed up screaming, the monochrome fight between Gorr and Thor was cool and creepy, and the ending is touching and beautiful.
Thanks for the review Chris. Congrats on your endeavors. Wishing you the best!
Love your shirt Chris!
MCU is all garbage now. both Taika Thors were trash. Keep Taika far away from Thor for the love of god.
The fact that you have no inclination to watch Taika's overblown vanity project again but are going to watch Top Gun: Maverick for a third time should be everything you need to acknowledge the current state of Marvel and Hollywood in general.  $250 million dollars for this shit when a far better film earlier this year, The Northman, was made for far less than half that sum.  Not to mention Maverick, which cost $80 million less and looks 1000% better, visually-- hell, Interstellar came out eight years ago, cost less than even Maverick and still looks better than anything in Love and Thunder's mess of over-abundant CGI, largely thanks to so much of the film clearly having been shot in The Volume.  And none of that even approaches the myriad other problems this film has, from tone to characterization to "story" to pacing.  Stop simping for this shit, Chris.  You know better.
The kids getting powers kind of cringy for me
This wasnt a review
They had to remove interesting content to give time to inclusion, representation and more woke shit, its as easy as that. Unnecesary characters, unnecesary moments... less of the important shit that actually makes a movie good.
Ragnarok was my favorite Thor movie..Love and Thunder is my least favorite..Gorr was severely underutilized…Janes arc was rushed…and wayyy too much comedy. There was a lot of potential with the movie…it’s sad it was mostly wasted.
Not really sure why being a critic is weird just because you’re making film yourself. This was hardly a review. Use to come to hear you actually discuss the movie, breakdown the movie, and give your final thoughts. Not pander just because you’re making films now.
I think I was just disappointed that the trailers made me think Thor was going to have a funny/secretly deep (in taika waititi fashion) story about not wanting to do super hero stuff anymore because of all he’s lost and then realizing that people do need him and sacrifice is part of what it means to be a hero. I compared it to Metroman in megamind becoming musicman. And it’s annoying cause the start of the movie where the guardians gotta convince him to single-handedly save the day and he’s just not into it felt in the vein of that idea.
I loved the movie tbh. But I do wish we had more with Gorr cause Christian Bale did an AMAZING job and was the best of the movie imo.   I think Ragnarok might be a bit better, but this was still great.
Yeeees , missed your videos
Idk, i respect you a lot, but this and Ragnarock are just as weak. Both very funny, both of them really visual, both tell dumb stories filled with plot holes. Ragnarock is better edited, but hardly a great movie.
You like Thor: Love and Thunder? The movies early work was a little to new wave for my taste, but when Gorr came out in the beginning, I think it really came into it's own, both commercially and artistically. The whole movie has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the movie a big boost.
This movie was 🔥 🗑. These Marvel movies are just getting worse by every release. Something’s gotta give, we need to get back to the phase one days.
I don't care what anyone said, the Shakespearean tragedy undertones of Thor 1 and his development into Thor Dark World were ultimately his best movie depiction. I'm sick of comedic Thor, and I'm sick and tired of Taika Waititi thinking that literally EVERYTHING has to be funny. The best character arc in Avengers IW and Endgame was Thors. Seeing  a glimmer of his tragic character again when talking to Raccoon brought me back to his original serious self that I loved from his former movies. But this, no, if they continue with him being comedic and there being no lingering serious undertones to any of his films, then I'm done.
OMG SCREAMING GOATS!!!!!!!!!
maybe they had to cut a lot of the movie because the CGI was not ready and there was problems with the VFX studios ??
This was one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen. A movie about stopping the god killer but goes and kills gods himself. Called love and thunder but literally only get 1 minute of love and thunder…I could go on but. It’s no point. -2 out of 10
Review starts at 2:09
Portman gave an interview the other day saying HEAPS of dramatic scenes were cut and she's gutted about it, PLUS Gorr scenes of him killing other Gods was also cut. So fuck knows what happened during production.
Always waiting for your review. ❤
Complete and utter cinematic failure
Yeah, I kinda hate I thought the same. A LOT of good elements, but it was a bit disjointed.   It doesn't help that I was blown away by Top Gun: Maverick immediately afterwards.
I actually really liked the movie, I'm kinda perplexed by the level of negativity surrounding it. I just wish we got more Gorr, Christian Bale was fantastic
This is a complex movie just because it feels like it's all over the place. Personally the humor doesn't feel as flushed out it as entertaining as Ragnarok was.
you sir are stepping into an industry that does not care for the characters nor the staff that works for them
I almost walked out when he poured the beer on Stormbreaker smh...I was like wtf is this??
It wasnt good, not good at all, they should let marvel films rest, its done
The best movie I've seen this year is Top Gun: Maverick. But my favorite is Elvis. Multiverse Of Madness and Love And Thunder are two of the worst films I've seen this year. Beavis And Butt-Head Do The Universe is better.
Watched this last night. Christian Bale's Gorr was def the standout performance &, of course, Chris Hemsworth's Thor is loveable & entertaining as always.  Didn't much like the annoying kids & WTF was going on with Russell Crowe's accent? 🤔 A shame the Asgardians of The Galaxy weren't it it for longer but I realise that may have taken up more of the already compressed storylines of Lady Thor & Gorr. I did read that Love & Thunder was cut in half from the original 4 hour film so hopefully we may get the full director's cut on bluray? 🤞
It's a cringy comedy, it's another MCU garbage 🤷🏾‍♂️
Marvel needs a Chris Stuckman cameo. Reviewing the heroes actions. Maybe on "The Boys" reviewing the movies the heroes do.
Marvel movies suck now.
Do a review of RRR
Allowing Jane to wield Mjolnir is mega-cringe.
Do a review of RRR
Gorr was the best part but was underutilized. There was way too many jokes in this movie. It worked in the previous Thor movie but this one had too many. It was too invasive that every scene had a joke that just didn’t land. I couldn’t take the heavy subject matter seriously because of how many jokes were stuffed in. Aside from that, I really loved how it ended.
The potential for a great film is definitely visible. It feels like the film completely changed direction on the cutting room floor, and was watered down for child audiences. Which is why we don't see much of Gor. Many of his scenes were too mature for kids. This Thor film felt more like a Nickelodeon TV series, and I'm sure Taika didn't want that. I personally wanted more scenes like the one when Odin passes away.
TOP GUN MAVERICK proves others are also ready for something other than cheap-looking superhero movies.
The Russo's version of Thor is the best yet. Let's get them for thor 5. That's how u get this franchise to a billion
This movie was so weird. It felt like two halves of two separate movies, stitched together. Just didn't love it. Loved everything with Gorr, and the serious scenes with Jane, but overall just fell flat.
build one tree
Talk about under-utilising a character, you get Christian Bale playing Gorr the God Butcher and we see him kill 1 God on screen. . . And that’s in the first 5 mins of the movie
Supposedly the rough cut was 4 hours long.  There are so many different threads dangling that a lot of it gets short-changed.  At that point why not just break it into two movies?  Sure you spend a little more on marketing and distribution, maybe some quick reshoots so the 2 movie flow is a little more seamless.  In the end you're going to make double the money anyway!  So I'm kind of shocked they didn't talk about going that route.
I'm really worried Taika seems to be following a Shyamalan-ish path; this movie was his "The Village", and his Star Wars movie may end up being another "The Last Airbender" if he isn't careful...
They should of did 3 parts with the real god butcher story. Creating the Thor Core
Since the stupid god characters (at least the few we get to see, and that includes Thor) basically act like the superheroes from The Boys it's hard to feel compassion when they're getting slaughtered. I actually rooted for Gorr, to be honest, since he's the only character with any motivation or emotional ark.
People are giving this guy Taika waaay too much credit. I remember when M. Night Shyamalan was the hot new director everyone was in love with, then we grew accustomed to his style, and these days we know exactly what to expect from one of his films. I predict Taika Waititi will go down this same road in the years to come. And people are going to keep using the “b-but he made Jojo Rabbit!” excuse, yeah M. Night also made The Sixth Sense once upon a time.
I think Marvel needs to fail, at least for a while. I actually think it would be good for the industry, overall. I'm so ready to be wowed by an original blockbuster again.
Did anyone else think Gorr sucked?  I didn’t care about him as a villain.  I didn’t think Christian Bale’s performance was any good.  Am I the only person who felt this way?  P.s.  I didn’t like any of the movie tbh
Hoping we get a Stranger Things 4 review. Know Chris is a busy man and there's a lot of hours to watch but always enjoy his takes on shows.
They took Hemsworth from That god awful 2016 Ghostbusters, gave it all the steroids and plugged him into this Thor movie. What a massive let down.
Gorr was awesome, but his threat level was told to us not shown. Yes he attacked new Asgard, but if he showed up to the City of the Gods and start wrecking the place and Killing Gods left and right… would had been more impactful:
I must be the only one lovning this movie. The absolute insanity and the totally dark scenes make a good balance for the movie in total I think.
2:45 there's nothing wrong with making a review of bad movies, and just warn your audience, save their time and money. It's still bothering me that you did not make Matrix and Resident Evil film review...  I've paid and go to cinema to watch this shit.
oh my God, I though I was the only weirdo that keeps rewatching Top Gun lol. I went last week again, that was my fourth time & now I'm trying to stop myself bcs enough is enough lol. But it was definitely worth it each time

Heimdall's son, Astrid, wanted to be called Axl from Axl Rose of Guns N Roses. If you listen carefully, Korg, says just call him a--hole.. 🤣 It's kinda a shot at Axl Rose because he acts like that towards fans in concerts.
They are clowning their own movie in various interviews, and laughing hysterically about it. They shovel crap, and rake in the billions.  They doubled down on everything that made Ragnarok a success.  Its a joke to them because they actually believe this is what we want.  With  every Marvel movie as of late, I appreciate SHAZAM more and more
Great T-shirt
What a shitty movie, 1-star!
Your reviews were better b4 you started making your own. This review feels like an advertising cash grab. Did you even review the movie or ramble on about the leash coming off?!?!?
I loved Ragnarok. I feel like there were a lot of serious and epic scenes to balance out the jokes. But this one just felt like...an exhausting stand up comedy show
Marvel movies have been crap for a while now
I heard it was a romantic comedy movie lol
The only Waititi's film that I like is "What We Do in the Shadows"
Thor going heavy into comedy was a nice change of pace, for people who want to watch a variety of film styles. Instead of the same old formulaic stuff
The movie was terrible. It makes very little effort to get serious with the story or the characters. It was more interested in jokes. the jokes don't land so you're left with weak characters and a non existent story. made the whole experience totally unbearable. Not offen I want to leave the cinema early. The last time was the last jedi. Both Disney films 🤔.
It's a better film than Ragnarok. I saw Ragnarok once loved it but had no particular want to watch it a second time. I saw love and thunder and it built on all that was good about Ragnarok and just did it better. It was a great RomCom in space with great action, characters and an emotional core. I have seen it twice already and can't wait to see it again. Best Thor movie and a top MCU movie.
Being visually stunning does not make a good movie. This movie is trash and the fact that you admitted you won't be seeing the movie again even though you've watch other Thor movies multiple times is very telling of how trash this movie is. Don't try to downplay how trash this movie is just because you want in on the business.
Oh you are like me, Chris. When in doubt just go see Top Gun again.
WATCH MS MARVEL ASAP DUDE  Also, REVIEW ETERNALS YOU COWARD
This was a terrible review. Just sayin. I guess not every review can be great 🤷🏽‍♂️
I just skipped it. It simply did not look good. Like, NWH, DS2 and Shang Chi have been great but with the mediore "time wasting" D+ shows and a feel like keeping up with the MCU is becoming homework, the marvel FOMO aint a thing for me anymore. Like, why watch Thor when you can wait the 45 days and watch The Boys or Stranger Things S4. Watching a film is an investment of time and money and id rather pay to watch Top Gun and not a 200 million dollar SNL sketch
I pray this movie bombs. Please people stream this movie, do not reward this unwatchable trash with your hard earned money. This is the worst MCU movie I've ever seen. A tonal catastrophe, muddled, far too short, jokes at every single second, Thor has been entirely character assassinated to be a bumbling, insufferable (now the Guardians look bored and annoyed whenever he's doing anything), silly idiot who weeps at movies on dates with Jane, calls his hammer like it's a dog and annoys everyone he's around (Heimdall's son gets bored of him and tells him to go away, the Guardians look exasperated by him now being an idiot, Valkryie and Jane look at him like a fool when he, for some random reason, falls out of the Bifrost and destroys part of New Asgard like he accidentally destroys the temple of the people he's trying to save). I am astonished how bad this movie is. You get brief moments where Thor acts like Thor but then he resumes being this new airhead simpleton jock character that Taika and Chris are loving to turn him into. It's such a shame, there's a really brilliant outline here but it's just absolutely saturated, stuffed to the gills with silliness and tension breaking comedy and character assassination (with Thor). Like Gorr. Bale is predictably phenomenal as him but he’s so, so underutilised and they completely avoid some of the best moments of his comic run like the Godbomb and deny him any kind of actual character like: Is he evil or is it just the sword whispering to him and manipulating him, it’s never explained? We literally get an hour and 20 minutes into this movie that doesn’t even reach 2 hours long, before we actually get a meaningful, legitimate conversation between Thor and Gorr, aside from one fight where they throw a few small exchanges with no substance. We see next to none of his brutality against the Gods like in the comic where it’s more of a haunting, murder mystery involving Gods being hunted like prey, tortured extensively and butchered. He’s truly tame here. He kills one God at the beginning of the movie, Thor finds Sif in the aftermath of his next butchering (they don’t even explain why she’s been gone for about 9 years in universe and instead make time for jokes despite her having lost an arm) and then Zeus references some killings. That’s literally it. You get absolutely nothing in terms of actual God butchering. Where was his torture of Thor from the comics? Why didn’t they write it so that Gorr had met Thor years before like in the comics? He’s so disappointingly handled and truly, truly surface level, a Malekith/Ivan Vanko level of mishandling and lack of care by the script. unfortunately for Bale.    And again, seriously, why is Thor an absolute bumbling, aloof, head in the clouds simpleton now? Seriously, did he get CTE from all his years fighting bad guys? He acts like someone who's not all there and the joke is that the characters are written and directed to mirror that. Notice how loads of times in the movie, characters look annoyed or bored with Thor, like he's a bad smell, because he's written to act like an annoying, absent-minded screw up? He flies away and then...for some reason...smashes into and breaks one of the pillars in New Asgard, much to the dismay of the people, which already is a copy of an earlier part of the movie where he smashes the sacred temple that the whole point was to preserve? And it's all because of Taika's obsessive need to write jokes for 4-year-olds. It is literally farting in the bathtub, laughing at the bubbles level of humour. Taika Waititi forgot the first rule: Never go full retard.   And why did Thor go back to using Mjolnir? Obviously it’s his longstanding weapon in the comics but in the context of the MCU, Stormbreaker (exclusively Beta Rey Bill’s in the comic) was the upgrade, the King’s weapon, why did he regress back to Mjolnir? I'm honestly shocked how awful it is. Thank God I didn't pay money to be disappointed by this and fund the Mouse. Oh, and I adored Ragnarok. Absolutely loved it, aside from the odd one or two goofy moments that encapsulate this entire movie. That's the problem. Taika saw what people loved in Ragnarok (playing popular rock music over Thor – 4 Guns N Roses tracks, 4?!, I love Guns but 4 tracks from the same band as well as a character being named after them and Guns being referenced? - the play scene with Matt Damon, Luke Hemsworth and Sam Neil, Thor shrieking like a little girl at the Grandmaster) and just turned that all up to 11 and repeated it all again but without any rhyme or reason. I haven't seen Eternals, which people gave bad reviews, but this movie is just appallingly bad. It's exactly as advertised though. A spoiled, 6 year old's fever dream of a movie, which is exactly what Hemsworth and Waititi said it would be, that Waititi had the 'imagination of a child' but sadly the MCU, banking on Ragnarok's success, let him have free reign to butcher Thor. Now I know how the people who hated Ragnarok felt for what they saw as Thor being made into a goofy idiot. I didn't feel that there but I 100% felt it here. ‘I’ll ruin your mythos in a minute baby’. Thanks Taika, you did.
I respect other opinions, but for me this movie was bad! The only good thing was Christian Bale
Isn't there supposed to be a 4 hour cut somewhere?
Chris Stuckmann, you should have followed your own advice and didn't review this movie, instead of trying to find it watchable. Sorry, but Thor: Love and Thunder was horrible. You should watch reviews by The Critical Drinker (with MauLer) and Nedrotic, they destroyed the movie.
Appreciate this review. Just saw the movie last night and agree with many of your points. Coincidentally I have also seen Top Gun 3 times!
The movie was terrible, Taika Waititi should never direct another Marvel movie again. I feel like he seems Thor as a joke, like a silly goofy character that shouldn’t be taken seriously. He sucks, he’s not funny, and he ruined the character of Thor.
Chris Hemsworth was an executive producer for this film, so he got his real-life daughter and wife in it. Gorr's daughter, Love, is really Hemsworth's eldest daughter. His wife, Elsa, was the wolf woman on a female wolf.
The comments from Bale and Waika just hint that there was a LOT of studio interference mucking things up and now they're trolling Disney because of the end result.
".... I'm going to watch Top Gun for the third time" in a Thor review, yep same way I felt about it...
I miss hillariocity, a reviewer not criticizing bad movies is kinda lame, shang shi was in your best movies of the year so, im kinda concerned that you are going to become james rolfe 2.0.
I just hated the dark gorr scenes we got then it would transition into a goat yelling. Completely lost me emotionally
I'm guessing he'd give it about a B-. At least a C+.
You are so pretentious I can't stand you! I used to think that you are a true fan, but no! You are just another woke, pretentious, self absorbed celebrity that we are all sick off by now. Only you would like a film as bad as this.
Video starts at 2:08.  Thank me later!  23% runtime off your back.
personally i felt the potential was somewhat wasted. there is a much better film hidden in that story. comedy was tuned up a bit too much, made the dramatic parts feel somewhat flat to me. ragnarok balanced it a lot better.
Hey Chris, mad appreciate you and what you do! Gotta ask though, where is your review of The Northman?!?!?!?! Really curious to hear your thoughts.
have you watched elvis?
It's definitely the most adult MCU film. We see Thor's buttocks. Zeus says orgy at least 3x. They say sh💩t at least half a dozen times. Lady Sif says "Oh s--t" after she realizes she won't make it to Valhalla because she survived.
STOP. MAKING. SHITTY. MARVEL. MOVIES.
No Way Home isn't exactly an MCU film the way Thor L&T is.
I think it was a waste of characters and actors... Like they could have done so much more with Gorr, Jane and Valkyrie. Even Thor is reduced to a couple of jokes. And you have more goat jokes than proper development or story...  I've watched Thor's movies a couple of times, at cinema and at home and let's say that with this one I'm not looking forward to repeat. As a matter of fact I'm less interested in this UMC Phase 4.
Thor Love and Thunder is definitely a video tape I'd return.
This wasn't a good Film Chris. Let's be honest here, if this wasn't marvel it would be a flat out bomb.
I only want to see people viciously criticizing this movie it has no redeeming qualities and deserves as much negativity as possible
I enjoyed this movie
I actually kinda liked the film it’s no Ragnarok but I just thought it was a solid fun and hilarious marvel movie 7/10
Lmao when you realise Chris never reviewed The Eternals
HiTop Films had the best takeaway imo: It almost feels like Taiko Waititi is making fun of the entire MCU at this point.
hmm i think we all agree the clash tones in this movie is the reason for the backlash.
I didnt like the movie but I m glad that movie was great for some people.
Well, maybe if the creative team and writing staff at Marvel were less concerned about social politics and political correctness and put…wait for it…the STORY at the forefront of their writing process, we may see an improvement. Just a thought.
Thor 4 1. They ruined Thor. 2. Cringe identity politics.
Jane foster had a serious condition and I feel all the jokes undercut that loss thst should have felt sad. Instead it fell flat.  I also believe Gorr was so under utilized. I'm hoping that they make an extended cut on blue ray DVDs. 🙏  please 🙏  give me something more tangible that highlights the seriousness of the situations happening on screen.
5:48 that is correct. it really sucks that they aren't unionized. some of the vfx in this film aren't rendered properly and then that article came out regarding marvel enforcing unrealistic deadlines and last minute vfx changes whilst underpaying and crunching those vfx artists.
Thor: Love and Thunder feels boggled down by its tonal inconsistencies and rushed pacing, most likely due to its short runtime.  But it still manages to deliver a vast amount of energy and humour with impressive action sequences, and a great villain portrayed brilliantly by Christian Bale.  I’d give Thor: Love and Thunder a B.
The main problem was that the director tried to tell 2 long different stories in 1 short movie. Thor vs Gorr should have been it's own movie and the same applies to Jane Foster.   Gorr barely appeared on the screen, wasn't developed enough to feel like a real threat. You can replace Gorr with that Elf villain from Thor 2 and the story would have been the same.  It wasn't Christian Bale's fault, but that of the script writer. In this movie Gorr is a forgetable villain.  Jane Foster deserved a movie of her own. There should have been more focus on her struggle to fight cancer while also trying to protect the world from villains.  I think these 2 stories don't mix well together, because you can't fully develope one without taking the center stage from the other. What we got was a half-baked compromise which fails to deliver a memorable villain and it's serious moments are compromised by childish humor.   I am not against comedy, I even enjoyed some of the jokes, but they remove any sense of danger from the villain's part and they take from the time which could have been used to improve the plot.  I'm tired of this depressed Thor who is constantly dealt bad hands. This guy went through so many emotional crisis by this point (all his family dead, his home destroyed, his friends either died or left him and his ex girlfriend had cancer). Why does Marvel hate Thor so much?  Will we ever see a movie where he tackles his issues head on without everything being turned into a joke? Will we see Thor take responsibility and lead his people like the hero his father wanted him to be? Not in the MCU, that's for sure!
Nowadays, watching a Marvel production is a slog of watching that one drunk in the bar who thinks he's really funny when really all he is, is loud, stupid, and obnoxious and doesn't know when leave.
1. VFX issue is typical Disney being a douche but they also are starting to use the LED walls more and are probably just still learning how to use that technology efficiently. 2. Gorr did zero butchering. Massively wasted villain. 3. Taika turns every serious moment into a damn joke.
The screaming goats just screamed a bit too much.. the whole Zeus thing seemed like a bad joke.. thor himself was a parody .. just made him look dumb af..  Gorr was awesome and should have had a lot more screen time
He said something negative about the VFX... And? What's the big deal?
Thor with short hair was more serious and spot on funny when he needed to be
******** One critic called it the jumping of the shark ..... its known as  the Clooney "Batman and Robin" of Marvel. Its over folks. Its just complete garbage. Money grabs. CGI crap. The Batman was GREAT. Logan was great. That's it. This garbage and all the Marvel TV shows and movies along with the sewer Star Wars garbage should all be thrown in the trash and rebooted. Enough of this. Scorsese was 100% correct. Its comic books on screen. The END of Cinema *********
Couldn't agree more, like I enjoyed it but I wouldn't say it's great. Like a solid 2nd best Thor movie. Probably will watch the Zeus/God based scene a few times because there was some majorly interesting gods portrayed there (like the Polynesian one that hasn't ever been seen on film before) but otherwise I'll probably not be bothered. If anything I'm a bit disappointed with the Jane situation, Natalie Portman still being absolutely wasted but less so than before lol. Also, if they do make another Thor movie they'll probably introduce a dog or something that he loves just to kill it off because apparently every movie has to really hurt him??
The movie was a load of horse shxt. I rewatches No way home, Multiverse again.... The actually sucked too second go round.
is there going to be a sideline of "gender" agenda again like in the past few movies? If it is I'm done.
Dude you were way too nice about this movie. Like, visually dazzling? visual artists are being exploited and they're not being given enough time to complete tasks and it really shows. I'm sad that you can't really express yourself freely anymore now that you need to tame your opinion to make your way into the industry. I still love your channel, but now I'll watch your videos with a huge grain of salt.
The first 6 minutes with Gorr was interesting. Then for the next 90 minutes or so, it's mostly written as a Monty Python skit. The entire scene with Zeus felt like I was watching Mel Brooks' History Of The World Part I (1981).
I just hope Korg gets a shit ton of screentime! Going to see the film on Sunday. :)
Finally you made a review I been waiting lol
So disappointed in this movie.
When are you reviewing the Northman?
Chris.. hate to break it to you but Taika made those comment because he is a jerk. There's no way around it. He prides himself of being a jerk anyway. It's his persona. I know you love the director and its hard to comment on other director while being one. But it just had to be said.
It felt like someone gave Adam Sandler the reigns for like 1/4 of the movie
Its not boring but it feels a bit like lots of comedy sketches thrown together
Worst MCU film of all.  Thank you for the video, and I love your shirt!
This movie is trash!!
Chris, you should watch and make a review about the new horror film (found footage film) called incantation. It is on netflix, definitely give a watch. People loving it
I've seen it 4x and the one scene that completely falls apart is when Thor empowers all the children. That scene was awful. One girl used a stuffed rabbit to kill baddies. Then when Jane came back to say all her cheesy lines.
It was cut from 4hrs to 2hrs. A lot of stuff was thrown out. Should have been 3hrs at least.
Hi Chris Please review Stranger Things Season 4
I only enjoyed for the experience and personal reasons. But for movie I understand. People think we are clown if we laugh at stupid joke. Tell me people, is it clown to laugh at stupid joke or is gatekeeping how we feel about the movie is consider clown?
Man, the MCU struggles hard with Thor. While I did like Ragnarok, I thought even that was a wild departure for his character. Is it too much to ask for a silly movie that handles Thor with the maturity of Infinity War?
I truly don’t understand and am completely confused because I didn’t necessarily feel like Ragnarok was memorable and love and thunder was a great time and completely enjoyable.
It almost felt as if there was no actual script. Just a barely put together mesh of ideas that didn't get explored enough. I actually really liked the movie but this bothered me throughout the 2 hours. We suddenly got from the prologue to the final encounter? It felt like zero exposure was given to the characters in that frame.   At least it was enjoyable and they redeemed Jane , which wasn't that developed in the past. Also the actors did really well all things considered.
The first 2 acts are a bit choppy. Comedy is overabundant to a point that takes away from the movie. Though since watching it, I'm starting to believe that though not properly explained, this is not how the real events went by, but rather, how Korg is telling a group of children of them. Considering the movie starts and ends with Korg telling the "Tale of Thor and Jane Foster" it could be the reason. Doesn't make the bad parts better. At the same time, all the Jane stuff, if you have had somebody go through that, yeah it is really accurate especially before the final confrontation.
What is the wokeness level of this movie?
One of the worst movies.
Gorr the God Butcher in the comics is an incredibly serious and somewhat dark story. This definitely has some conflicts to the overall comedic tone of Thor movie franchise.
a film critic that cant critique has no value.
The Russo’s took what Waititi was going for and mastered it in Infinity War…
Can I write the score for your film Chris?
Almost at 2 million subs!
Been waiting for this!
Taika Waititi should be given a Deadpool film. He would thrive there.
Chris is a fanboy who can't say when a movie in a franchise he enjoys actually sucked. AGAIN, he's being far too nice. "The marketing confused me."  JUST REVIEW THE FILM. Did you like it??!
Your wife “got Stuckmanized” and had twins! I’ll pass on it but enjoyed the review… so there’s that
Video starts at 2:09
Review of stranger things 4?
That displate website is broken. Nothing loads for me. If you're gonna be a shill at least shill decent stuff.
Top Gun 3: Love & Thunder is going to be even better than Maverick. They’re bringing Val Kilmer back as IceMan the Pilot Butcher.
I'm really confused about why people see Ragnarok as a "good" film. It can be totally fun, but "good? So much comedy and unnecessary jokes in a story like The Ragnarok (some comic book readers compare the its epic to the LOTR) takes you out of the tension that should exist, it's the destruction of Asgard and Thor seems very calmed and confident. I'm not surprised by a divisive opinion on Love and Thunder. Apparently is just more of the same 🤷🏻‍♂️
You reviewed this MCU trash but you didn't review the Northman? Odin must be very disappointed in you.
The fact that someone thought it was a good idea to cut Christian Bale footage is both the dumbest and funniest shit ever
Thor movie is trash 🗑
You liked Thore in this movie? (who suddenly was a complete moron) and you liked the comedy? Which was just dumb the top stupid slapstick and had no balance at all (If wan thinks MCU is only stupid jokes - yeah her it was). BUT the structure was your problem??????????????????????????????? Believe me when the movie will drop hugely next weekend It is not because of the structure.
This movie wasted some very interesting premises.  The most appealing set-up from 'Endgame' was Thor's freedom. He had spent his life up to that point following the fate written for him, so in the end, he decided to write his own fate with the Guardians of the Galaxy.  And the foundation of that team is really of loss. "Losers", as said by Peter Quill himself. And after 'Infinity War', Thor might just be the biggest one in there.  Then, there's Jane's cancer. Quill lost his mother to cancer, surely there's a lot they could've done with this.  Add in misfires of humor, underutilization of Christian Bale, sloppy writing that's pretty much demanded by Phase 4, and disposal of '80s throwback that made 'Ragnarok' so effective; we get the most underwhelming Phase 4 MCU movie.
I think this was a good movie... But, I'm done with thor solo films. Thor: Rag was awesome because the Hulk/Banner aspect really created a lot of depth for both characters!   But, love and thunder really suffered from clearly heading in a comedy over the top action direction... But, then it gets kind of dark world-ish.  Give me more of the characters of the Thor story... But, not together anymore... Team Thor with spiderman, Valkyrie and Strange, Mighty Thor and fucking hawkeye... Anything but another thor solo film.
I agree something behind the scenes is different. This movie, along with Eternals and Doctor Strange 2, feel much more free wheeling and less "focused" on the main external narrative. I appreciate the experiment, even as some of the flaws in the films are grating a bit. That said, this is what MCU detractors asked for: less committee, more director driven, less tie ins.  I believe Feige is still playing the long game, but accommodating these complaints is starting to have an impact on the quality of the franchise. I blame Chapek.
the movie is a 5 out of 10 and the interviews make it a 3 out of 10
The marvel comedic universe is done
Taika Waititi himself admitted that he shot the first season of "Our Flag Means Death" (which is fantastic by the way) WHILE editing this movie. And maaaaan does it show! I love Taika but I am worried that he's got too many pots on the boil and that his work is going to suffer for it. Have you seen the dude's upcoming filmography? He must be exhausted! Still looking forward to "Next Goal Wins" though.  Also is it just me, or are people really feeling the Marvel burnout? I know I am, and I think they really stepped on their own dick in the long run when it came to bombarding us with all of these shows in between movies every three to four months. That's just too much homework for me!
Honestly, shame on Taika Waititi in that featurette for making fun of the VFX (or any work that wasn't his), especially when there are aspects of the screenplay (which was his work) that are arguably just as flawed, if not more so.  I've generally liked his stuff too, but that featurette feels like it crosses a line.
Seems like it could be a case of some studio meddling, Taika is very capable of balancing humor with drama. We've seen him do it before, and then suddenly he couldn't in this movie, which mind you, is an MCU movie. Given how MCU loves to crack jokes every scene now, I have a feeling they wanted Taika to up the 'comedy' despite his wishes.
Where's your Northman review, BRUHHH
chris would’ve shat on this film a few years back
Final saw Thor. What a terrible movie. I mean everything was bad. The writing, pacing, jokes, acting all bad. They made a mockery out of what should have been serious moments. The jokes don’t land and Jane Foster Thor was a poor realization of the character. Terrible use of Gorr and his plan made no sense. Outside of No Way Home, phase 4 has been below average.
Honestly the 3rd act was brilliant imo and the other acts are good but as a whole the movie feels unbalanced. Also why do we not see Gorr actually butcher gods apart from 1, very strange.
Almost all the funny parts were in the trailer
smh wow............knew he was gonna shill this OMG facepalming........ has anyone heard anyone who is a movie critic say they enjoyed it??? praising "a lot of the comedy worked for me".......woe
The Thor we know died in Infinity War 2. Now his character is just a tool those woke idiots.  He is now reduced to a sidekick drag queen.B4 we even know, he will b revealed gay.
A complete deconstruction.  Hated thor 4.  Terrible, moreso because of lost potential.
I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I think it’s being overhated to be quite honest. I think they needed a little bit of scenes with Gorr actually butchering gods. I think it also could’ve benefited from more Valkyrie and time to breath during some serious moments. I enjoyed it more on my second watch though I think it’s up there with Ragnarok.
The review I was waiting for💯💯😭
Almost at 2 million‼️
A review of Jurassic World Dominion?
I think I like Stuckmann better before he became a full-fledge director/producer/worker in the industry...I feel like his channel has been watered down and his criticisms have been dulled now that he is in...most of those jokes in Thor was not good and didn't land...a little too much comedy and not enough seriousness when you felt it merited it....
I hated Thor love and thunder.
Do a review on Baz Luhrmann's ELVIS.
They tried to make this a straight up comedy, but it wasn't that funny. I thought Natalie Portman as a quippy superhero was borderline terrible, as she's not a strong comedic actress.   Hemsworth and Bale clearly had a lot of fun making this, I'm jealous...because I didn't have a ton of fun watching it.
This Thor movie just wasnt it. It was decent, but not up to MCU caliber whatsoever. Needs a new director moving forward.
Review in 🇮🇳 INDIAN 3D  Movie 🎥 " Vikranthrona " Trailer and Rakkamma songs  Sir ... Please 🙏 your best  Reviewr👌........am wetting for you Review..,❤️💓💓💓💓
Only GOG is only anticipated for me. Nothing much exciting now. I have huge excitement in T&L & MOM but they haven't reached apart. NWH, Loki & Shang Chi was something I loved so far + moonlight somewhere but not a brilliant.  Coming other projects have not much ace to put on like.
I'm starting to feel the fatigue. Marvel needs to take a break.
I have to be honest and say I miss brutally honest Chris. Will we ever see the fant4stic version of him again?
I really liked the movie, but I think it could’ve used another 20-30 minutes. I get not everyone likes 2.5 hour movies, but more scenes with gorr slaying gods would’ve been great!
Here we go
I still like Chris but why can’t he just have integrity and criticize films
I feel like having to scroll more than 20% in to get to the review is a problem
The good parts where really really good, the bad things were sort of bad. On the whole I enjoyed Thor Four.
Can't wait to see your movie!
Leave it to Waititi to make another cookie cutter cash grab that prioritizes giggles over tension.
Good luck with your flick, Chris!
Stranger things?
Great review! 👍
0:10 Oh, you're releasing a film? Nice.
This movie definitely needed more Gorr!… that came out wrong. But in all seriousness I think compared to the Infinity Saga, Phase 4 can be summed up as “wtf is my identity?” or “where am I going with this?”
Me: Thor Love And Thunder wasn't great.  Chris: I don't review movies I didn't really like. Me: uh oh.
Funniest joke was Korg getting a lover, a rockman named Dwayne, lol pretty hard on that one.
Great video- refreshing style for a review.
Thor is honestly one if my favorite MCU characters. Wished they took this film more seriously at certain areas, made it longer, and gave Gorr more screen time
Real OLD COMIC THOR fans knows the pain!! they just turn The GOD into joker! why MCU Downplaying male superheroes.
Gorr: Ask me a question. Thor: So, what do you do? Gorr: I'm into, uh well, murders and executions, mostly.
Phase 3 was the Gold Standard
This is my second favorite Thor movie
Remember in early 2010s when Pixar suddenly dropped in quality of movies? They went from movies like WALL-E, Up & Toy Story 3 to movies like Cars 2, Brave, The Good Dinosaur & Monsters University & many more, with few good movies in between like Coco & Inside Out.   It feels like Marvel is also going through that phase.
i Really enjoyed Ragnarok much more.. This movie is waaaay to silly for me. They have made Thor really just a goof ball and borderline kinda retarded. everything is a joke, doing a stupid split to stop the motor bikes, storm breaker acting like a jealous girlfriend.. Its an earth shattering weapon! I couldn't even get into the severity of the situation that was occurring in the story because it was just silliness after silliness constantly. I miss the dramatic and exciting parts of these movies.
This movie was so incredibly boring to me. The humor fell flat, the performances were meh, and I was struggling to stay awake through parts of it. Could be me, maybe I'm just Marvel'd out, but I likely won't be catching this again anytime soon. And Jane? Why tease her return like that?
Lot of spoilers in these comments. Good job people 👏
An extended Bale cut would ideal
As a Filmaker, you’re still allowed to be critical of someone else’s work. At the end of the day, you’re a fan of this franchise and are still allowed to be disappointed when it doesn’t meet your expectations. It doesn’t make you unprofessional if you don’t hold your punches, as long as it comes from a place of good intent. 👍
Wow, one of the very rare moments in which I disagree with Chris. Yes, Taika is a master but this movie was so silly. And it was such a waste of an opportunity. The Gorr scenes are by far the only great thing. And it's only visually strong when Gorr is on screen (especially the black and white scenes). Otherwise this movie is a pointless mess. Most of the jokes don't land. Natalie portman does a decent job but there is no point to her character. Just a vehicle by which thor can end up with a little girl. Who btw isn't even part of most of the storyline. This movie was utter nonsense. I think it's getting away with it because we are all so obsessed with taika waititi after jojo rabbit, we are just happy to let this mess slide. Very unfortunate
Before now, every marvel movie in the MCU felt like a chess piece being moved to create an endgame (no pun intended) to LEAD us to Infinity War/Endgame... but now, in phase 4, it doesn't feel that way... especially with this movie... because, and I truly ask, what difference, in the GRANDER scheme of the MCU, does this movie make? No new character added. No new plot point added. They mcguffined some context. Killed off a character that we all assumed we'd never see again anyway. Nothing about asgard is newly added. Thor doesn't get a send off.  With every other MCU movie, ending at "Far From Home", if you plucked any single movie out of the MCU, you are missing a puzzle piece form the whole picture... but if this movie never happened, until I GUESS we see other wise, it really didn't need to exist
Apparently they cut a lot of Gorr scenes which is disappointing
Stranger Things 4 review?
was a entertaining movie, at the same time, a waste of potential.  Natalie was super badass💪
Give Taika Star Wars and give Thor a new director.
At first I didn't think L&T was that bad but then I went to sleep and thought about it more and yeah it's pretty bad. They made Thor a moron, Korg isn't funny and the writing is all over the place. I wish they'd release an extended cut
One thing that really annoyed me about the movie.  !!SPOILERS  INCOMMING STOP NOW!!          The "killing" of Korg felt like a saving on the effects budget vs being something had to happen especially they reversed the "death".
I feel that that "Love and Thunder" sacrificed the more rigid "buddy road trip to the end of the world" structure of "Ragnarok" for a more emotional journey for the characters. I think it went in some really dark and sad places and the excessive humor was there to balance it out. Also the plot being kind of all over the place was true to what Thor as a character goes through in this time of the MCU's story. Now, I'm not saying this is better or worse, I'm just saying that's how I see it. Every opinion is valid as long as one is  polite and willing to discuss. So, keep up the great work, do your best and take care mr Stuckmann! And good luck with "Shelby Oaks"! I'm sure it will be great!
I know this has nothing to do with the video but at the end you mentioned seeing 'top gun maverick' again and just gotta say, I've seen it four times now and it gets better every time. I'm definitely going more before it leaves theaters lol
If it was a other villian it could have been some what better
You should watch incantation from netflix
It's good, not great. Funny but really didn't explore the dark elements enough. And ultimately forgettable
Please watch rrr if you truly are a action junkie
Love your growth good brother can't wait to see ur movie
Thank you for making the time for this Chris. I really wanted to hear your opinion on this movie.
Waititi and Disney have become a little too “woke” for their own good.
Good luck on your TV show !
🎼  *_I... AM.... THE GREAT MIGHTY POO!..._*  🎶😅🤭
I didn't not like this movie at all
Even though I enjoyed Ragnarok more, Love and Thunder is still a close second. It was hilarious and a visual spectacle and it felt a movie Waititi wanted to make. I had a wonderful time with this movie.
This movies was bad 👎
I love this movie because it’s the first film that I teared laughing at it for how awful it was  I’m sorry but it was dogshit and I’m not saying that just because I want to hate on marvel  Im the guy who was addicted to ultimate alliance
Can we expect an Elvis review?
I really miss hilariocity reviews.
After seeing a couple of reviews, and thoughts on the movie, I am starting to wonder if perhaps Taika Waititi made this movie sort of as a spoof of the MCU.
This movie is about a PAGAN GOD???!!! 0/10!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
Personally I think you are being far to lenient with this movie. I’d say it’s easily bottom 3 Marvel movies, maybe even being the worst.  This will sound like I’m exaggerating, but I’m not. Not a single person audibly laughed in my packed theatre. I’ve never experienced that with a Marvel movie, or even a Disney movie for that matter.  Christian Bale is honestly the only redeeming part of this movie. It lacked in almost every department.
Please do RRR film review. The movie is present on Netflix with English subtitles. The movie's original language is telugu but the only version available is in Hindi language dubbed on Netflix. Please please check it out.
This movie was super disappointing for me. I walked out half an hour in the humour was just way too much, it legit felt like a total parody of Thor and the MCU. In my opinion it’s the worst of all the Thor movies to me.
playing too safe
“With every displays you buy, you build one tree”. How do I build a tree lol
It's okay, you can say the movie is complete garbage. Movies this bad should be criticized correctly. You can't let them get away with this.
People will soon get tired of the MCU i been stopped watching its too much and its all over the place
I find it odd that Chris hemsworth said that it was the best movie he has ever made or something of the like. and yet we get this version that seems very oddly edited and rushed. i would really love the 4 hour cut on d+ even if taika doesn't want it.
What I didn't like the most is the amount of narration. Is this how every movie is going to be? We are going to hear 15-20 minutes of explanations about previous installments?
Thor Literally stole Zeus’ Thunder! Lol 😂
It was a mess with some great bits.
I get that Chris is a filmmaker now, but I don’t think that means he should feel like he can’t say anything negative about movies. RLM make movies (very low budget ones, but still) and they do not hold back on their criticism.   And movies like this absolutely deserve it. I can’t believe he didn’t touch on just how uncomfortably unfunny this movie is. Screaming goats, really? This makes the “what are those?” joke in Black Panther look cutting edge in comparison. The Marvel formula is getting really stale, and the humor is just getting lazier with each passing movie.
My least favorite Waititi film 🎥 I feel exactly the same. I’ve watched Ragnarok many times. I’ll never watch this one again.
Why do I feel like this was almost good, like it I can feel it had the potential. It wasn’t completely doomed but it was in the end
2:35 Yeah, I still really don´t get that decision. Professional filmmakers are allowed to not like other filmmakers´ movies. It´s called word of mouth. We´re all human beings. You don´t have to shit on other people´s work but you can bring attention to what can be improved. Idk... Maybe it´s just me, but I still see you as a professional film critic AND filmmaker now. And as a critic you surely should be allowed to let your viewers know about all sorts of movies, not only the good ones. I also didn´t like that you stopped giving movies grades. Because here´s the thing: Even if you gave a movie a bad grade, that still didn´t stop me to watch a movie occasionally. Because I still want to make up my own mind. Opinions are like assholes! Everyone´s got one!
I totally agree! Hoping to hear your thoughts about Ms. Marvel
damn im gonna miss the ruthless chris stuckmann
You have the time to make money on YouTube? Nothing to supervice? It will be great!
there is something wrong with you audio.
bob chapek, there
Man, everyone hating on this movie makes me feel like when I got out of The Last Jedi. 😂 it’s like I saw a totally different movie! I had a great time with this, probably my favorite out of the new Marvel stuff besides some of the Disney+ shows which have been really good.
The movie was garbage, but you can keep simping for the director.  Maybe he'll let you peg him one day, since you're both into that.
Best T-shirt ever Chris 👏
Thor: Bored and Blunder
Chris you can be a film maker and still be critical of other people's work. Is ok
It’s wasn’t your imagination, Chris, a lot was missing from the movie. Taika and Chris Hemsworth both confirmed that there’s a 4 hour cut of the film. The same thing happened with Multiverse of Madness; Sam Raimi said that Marvel cut 45 minutes from the theatrical version of the film, thus, resulting in the plot holes and pacing issues( which Love and Thunder also has). Even No Way Home is re-released in September with the deleted scenes/footage put back in.  I hope Marvel is careful about this… They don’t want to get the same reputation that DC did with the extended cuts of their movies being the better version, and only getting released on Blu-Ray in order to make more money. It’s perpetuates the “ I’ll wait for it to stream “ mentality.
I thought it was terrible... like most of phase 4. Way too much comedy, and bad jokes at that, while butchering 2 of the best thor comics.
Maybe because I could have not cared less for most of this phase's projects, this one I actually enjoyed quite a bit! Yes it was utterly stupid and random but at least it had plenty new and surprising elements to it.
It sucks chris can’t be honest anymore. I’d imagine being a Hollywood phony wouldn’t be worth his time/ he was above it. But I guess no one is. I hate reviews where they tip-toe on their words
Apparently, the VFX artists that worked on various MCU films have been treated so badly by Marvel Studios. I think everyone should read up more about this situation, and more about vfx artists' struggles with low pay and being overworked.
I refuse to believe Taika was given any freedom on this project. Single handedly wasted the talents of Bale & Portman while also making a joke out of the character who's gone through the most amount of grief. Underwhelming in every aspect, except maybe the score.
Some people from the VFX studios have been complaining about Disney.  IMO that is the reason why Taika Waititi made fun of the CGI in his own movie.  I wouldn't be shocked to find out that someone at Disney encouraged him to do it.    Also, Christian Bale is a top star.  He can say whatever he wants during a interview and get away with it.
Loved the movie just wanted more Gorr. I think that's the common sentiment though.
Ocarina of Time!
0:12 I think of that quote all the time when I’m filming. I’m almost excited to feel like that once I go into post production on the film I’m working on which is my first. I bet every filmmaker probably thinks “yeah but this is actually horrible and unfixable” even though every rough cut for every film on the planet is the worst thing ever.
First Thor movie without Loki😢! Wasn’t ready!
Thank you for supporting vfx artists
It feels like taika made this movie for their kids family members and friends only 😒🙄👎 not for marvel fans
It was just a mess.
Lol, He barely talked about the movie. Honestly the Behind the scenes nonsense sounds more interesting than the film itself.
Gorr story should had stick to comic like god bomb, they would have brought back team thor&hulk for final battle and made thor&hulk absorbed god bomb energy to save everyone, we need infinity war like movies director direction serious brutal action pact when story needed, taika stop turning gods and super heroes in comedy circus 😒🙄👎
more and more i am starting to think, as talented and funny as he may be, that Taika Waititi is kind of a prick. maybe.
But... Shang Chi really wasn't even as good as Dr Strange in The Multiverse of Madness, and that movie (Dr Strange) was not particularly good.
I've been very torn on this movie. I wanted to watch it for ages because duh. then the trailer dropped... ok they ruined 2 big surprises that I would've loved to watch unspoiled but can't now. and it looked cringey like marvel at its worst. phase 4 hasn't been that great imo. then I read some reviews... idk I think I should skip this one. I'm afraid it will turn me into a more cynical being, more critical towards the mcu in general. so far I liked 80% of these movies in this universe and I'm fine with skipping the ones I don't wanna watch. also I kinda like taika less after unfortunately finding out some stuff about his private life. I also like tessa thompson less... ahhh for my own sanity I should keep myself from watching this movie and go back to ragnarök when times were simpler and better^^
I haven't seen it yet looks good though thanks for sharing and reviewing it and sharing your thoughts on it
Hi Chris,  I have been following you from a long time. It was great to see you going after your passion for film and filmmaking. From your talk, you have been lucky to get an at least good Indie-level budget to complete your film. I am sure you will ace the film with a good, if not the best, presentation. I too have started my First Feature Film in a 'shoe-laces' budget. I finished shooting all in January and, currently, it is in the final stage of editing.  All the best for your film. Shivesh From Bangalore, India
I actually really liked it  I hope though he goes in a more serious direction though. Plus it was packed with Guns N Rose's 🤘
Remarkably underwhelming. Give me Infinity War Thor not this buffoon~!
Chris, when you have the time I highly recommend the show The Expanse! I'd love to hear your thoughts on it, I personally think it's a modern classic that stands shoulder to shoulder with Babylon 5 and Battlestar Galactica. Anyway, love your video man, can't wait to see your film!
As usual love the videos. You're a real swell guy, and I hope to see Shelby Oaks.
I wanted to see Gorr actually butchering and watch more of him on screen, Christian Bale is one of the best actors ever
What Chris's review meant:- I loved Ragnarok, i also secretly love this movie but I ain't gonna tell you that cuz people don't seem to like this one so I'm gonna talk about complete nonsense for 9 mins
Top Gun!
I feel like two things may of happened  1. Taika Waititi wanted to make a darker, more mature movie about faith and mortality but Disney wanted Ragnarok 2.0 from him. Kevin Feige stepped in to mediate and there was a 60-40 compromise with the humorous stuff taking the front seat.  2. Taika Waititi had complete creative control over Love & Thunder with little interference from Kevin Feige or Disney and unfortunately he doesn't know how to handle very serious subjects or balance them with the humor he was going for.
I agree with many takes here,  there's something underlying that felt off. To me, the tone of the movie was off at times and the movie felt different during different parts. It's enjoyable but it doesn't have that tight feeling that Ragnarok had. The ending was damn good though for sure.
After looking into taika waititi Twitter history! He made it very clear he doesn’t care about the fans. He refused to read comics, and told us to be expecting disappointment. He also cut a lot of scenes that made the movie Excellent! But instead he rather have a comedy film…..  He pretty much told the fans to screw off and he doesn’t care about the concerns for the Thor character! Thor has comic storylines that people want to be taken seriously. For a better excellent character arc. But it’s pretty obvious he doesn’t care about that, and he wants to make Thor in his Image! And not the canon version of Thor! If Kevin foggy keeps getting less involved. Than Marvel movies are doomed!
Hey Chris. I am from India. And have been following you since 8 plus years. Will the film get an international release? (Shelby oaks)
To me, both Ragnarok and this one sucked haha
I don't see Thor as a God anymore. He's done his Godly duties for thousands of years, why can't we just let him be a goofy dad? That's his purpose now, he no longer has to bare the weight of the universe on his shoulders.
I thoroghly enjoy your work on this channel. I know you haven't reviewed any Indian movies before, but would love to hear your opinion about RRR.
Letting people talk about the movies in a negative way started with multiverse to a lesser degree. Bruce Campbell especially was pretty rough on the movie in interviews. Honestly, right now the MCU in general is sort of a drift. I don't feel like were moving towards anything other then "hey, the multiverse is a thing!". Everything just feels like a one off right now. Which is fine but they spent 3 phases conditioning us to expect that this is building to something. Even if this all does lead somewhere it's very very messy.
When are you going to start making videos on how to make it in Hollywood?
I've heard that there was a much longer 4h cut of the film, but they had to cut it down to be shown in theaters
Taika can only direct comedies and kids movies, dude literally has the mind of a 7 yr old.
Yo.. let's get Chris to 2mil
Not gonna lie.  I was absolutely dissapointed with the amount of comedy.  Too much, terribly placed jokes..  I love comedy sprinkled in there. But this was a bit more than needed. I surely hope he doesn't do this to his  Star Wars...
I loved Thor: Love & Thunder!
Hey Chris, I’m looking forward to your reviews for Jurassic World 3: Dominion, Lightyear, Elvis, and Minions 2: The Rise of Gru.
My thoughts on this movie. SPOILERS! .....      I LOVED the ending. There was no HUGE battle, the bad guy WON, Jane died, AND Thor finally found a purpose in life that's bigger than himself and his legacy.  The rest of the film, however, meh.
Video starts at 2:00
Love and Thunder was a lot of fun.  That is all i ever needed it to be.
Almost to 2 mil!!!! Congrats Chris!! Been here for awhile and it’s been an honor sir!!
Thorbin time anyone ?
After your movie comes out, many years down the road could Tommy Wiseau play Chris and show the struggles of making the movie?
Please make a review on RRR. I'm sure you will have a blast watching it 🔥🔥🔥
Marvel is nothing after Spider-Man No Way Home 🤨
When Chris didn't release a video on LaT I inferred he didn't like it. Nice to hear his thoughts on the movie in the end (similar opinion, it disappointed me but I didn't dislike it)

It felt like a teen titans go cartoon but in live action
I remember when Taika out of the blue in an interview went on a rant about the macbook's new keyboard design being bad to write scripts on. I'm not saying it's directly related to them promptly ending that type of keyboard (high RMA rates likely did), but it shook tech media for a little while and people with contacts claimed Apple took notice. Big name, heavy weight.
It's funny hearing Chris talk about a first cut. I'm working on sound on a short film i made with a film crew RIGHT NOW, and the director is so sad seeing an unfinished, extremely rough cut 😂 But, I'm finishing the sound up, which is already making him feel better.
Love and thunder was *slightly* less horrible than Ragnarok.  Mostly thanks to Christian Bale.
Why Korg though? He's just a rock dude
If you are the director and have no direction for your movie your in trouble. I say this about Taika and I loved Ragnarok but Love & Thunder will not get my money. I heard they make Thor a complete baffoon imagine that the hero of his own movie is clown. Also Taika is known for his SJW views I don't give a damn about Valkyrie being a lesbian who cares? This is where check out no thanks!
I thought Dr. Strange, Thor, and Black Panther(RIP) were supposed to be the 'serious' characters to balance out the MCU. The MCU is hero-comedy now.
I oddly find this film BETTER than Ragnarok. I felt it landed it's emotional beats without undercutting them with too much humour. I didn't mind the "stupid" as long as when heart was on screen, it remained.
I want to go back to the 90's where filmmakers really had passion on film other  than money.
Chris should review the boys
I liked Thor the most as a character in the first movie
I always love your honest opinion, Chris. It's okay to criticize Love & Thunder. Everyone knows the movie is far from perfect.
It's such a mediocre film
There really needed to be more Gorr Hela did more killing than Gorr, and he’s the god butcher  The entire scene with Zeus was a waste Russell Crow sounded stupid   Thor being overly simple is also overly done.  The character has lost so much, and yet he still acts childish  The jokes have gotten to be too much! I mean , hell, they should have had Gorr say the line, “ I am Vengeance!”  Just to get the laugh.
They need to drop Thor now before totally annihilating his character. This movie sucked and this is coming from someone who loved Ragnarok.
“New Era of Marvel” I think we need to talk about Bob Chapek…
also what marvel has done so far, it just makes us inevitably expect more out of their movies and i think marvel is taking a laidback route and i think the audience should do the same as well
Pointless movie reviewer now. If you don't like it....tell us. Or dont bother
SHELBY OAKS! SHELBY OAKS! SHELBY OAKS!
It feels like they completely nuked this movie in the edit. They took out any emotional weight in the Gorr story
When I saw this I was kinda comcerned you were gonna give it a glowing review. I’m very happy you were honest and critical
Sir i know you are really busy in post prod... but do make time for THE GRAY MAN by  Russo Brothers... the early reaction were positive but i would like to know your take on the same... BTW <3 LOVE from INDIA
This movie had a LOT of continuity issues that people seem to completely forget... if everyone Watched Thor, Thor 3, Infinity War and Endgame with in a week of watching Love and Thunder, their qualms with this movie would be a lot bigger... opinions aside, there are MAJOR issues with the world and continuity they built before... and the ones they show in this movie.  ANOTHER major issue, is you come away from the film exactly where you started off. Ok so Jane's dead.... well... up until this film, to the audience and story, she might not have ever shown up again anyway. So her death isn't significant.  Valkerie... she's right back to where she was jn the beginning of the film... they made it seem like she misses the adventurous and warrior lifestyle. But as soon as shes stabbed; she's down for the count and u never see her again. Thor... soooo he now has a mcguffined adoptive daughter/niece, which was never earned in the entire film btw, and so his life has meaning... and the 2 of them are gonna fight the forces of evil together?
I had fun with it, and I agree I don't think I'm going to watch it as much as Ragnarok. Not the worst Thor movie (looking at you, Dark World).
This movie was 🗑 hot garbage, basura, put it in the dumpster, throw it in the sea
The movie was hot garbage. I saw it for free and still want my money back. Bale was the best the film had to offer and he spends 30 seconds on the screen. I wish that were hyperbole and not mere exaggeration. Hemsworth should have said no to this script.
I blame the Russo's for leaving Thor without direction or purpose in Endgame. They should have made him darker and more serious. Would have been cool if he were an overprotective King, and married to Lady Sif. Then in the 4th film he has children of his own, and has to deal Gorr(who lost his daughter). There would be a grrater focus on fatherhood.
You call watching a movie 4 or 5 times “many times?”   If I love a movie, there’s no telling HOW many times I will watch that movie.
Review stranger things season 4
Too choppy and cartoony. Really wasted bale's performance.
Out of all the Thor movies, this one left me utterly disappointed. I missed when Thor was funny and had a seriousness to him. Infinity War was the perfect example of that, and they clearly need to bring back that badass Thor in the MCU. The only best part of this movie was undoubtedly Gorr. I knew that Bale would nail that role, but I was unhappy with the amount of screentime we got from him. We had the potential to have the next intimidating villain that would make history in the MCU, and it all went down the drain.
7:17 Spiderman No Way Home is a Sony movie though, they all are.
Been waiting for Chris to talk abt how Bad Thor love and thunder is
He liked Shang-Chi?!?  I thought that was an even bigger mess than Love and Thunder...
I’ll see it soon and most are saying it wasn’t good but might of been due to cuts.
Iron Man to Endgame: Quality > Quantity Post Endgame: Quantity > Quality
Taika Waititi must be stopped
The Bob Chapek effect is looking really bad.
Chris I’ve been a huge fan for years and I’m so happy for you that you’re able to live your dream and make films! I also wonder honestly wth marvel has a doing right now with just how much content they’ve been pumping out and I haven’t loved any of them so far. Curious as to yalls thoughts and maybe Chris’s as to why this phase of marvel has been so bad compared to the earlier ones?
Thor is always finding himself I'm sick of it, how many times has Thor got to find himself its getting boring.
Love your OOT shirt ❤
The issue to the problem with the film is that Marvel studios had many scenes removed from the final cut with new worlds, characters, and funny sequences. Really wished that they kept it as 3 hours.
Honestly I think a better film could've been made in the editing room
Taking about movies you don’t like should be okay, as long as it’s constructive, respectful, and in good faith
Something about the film feels strangely low energy. Like there's not much urgency to the events that are happening.
Some of Marvels vfx has become tv level in this new phase of marvel movies
I think Loki is a huge missing piece when it comes to a Thor movie.
My problem is what they did to Thor. They turned Thor into "Thor making jokes" into 'Thor is the joke". At some point, Marvel needs to tone down the comedic aspect of it.
Nice review but stranger things???
*"I don't make reviews on movies I don't like anymore, it's weird"*  Oh, so he liked it  *"So this is gonna be one of those weird ones"*  Oh wait, he didn't like it  *"I wouldn't even say I didn't like it"*   Why would you do this to me Mr. Stuckmann? I can't take all of these twists and turns
Great review
*People kept saying* (including myself) that Thor became a joke cracking character as a coping mechanism for losing so much… but it’s become apparent that Taika just did that because he wanted to make Thor “funny”
Another woke garbage. Horrible movie.
Is it just me or is his FOREHEAD getting HELLA BIG like MEGAMING BIG.
When everything is a joke nothing is funny
Lol Chris I just got out of the shower and put on the exact same ocarina of time T-shirt you wore for the review.
its because of Chapek, the CEO of Disney. Feige dont have the kind of control as he used to and things like Chapek saying that the movie couldnt be over 2 hours long, means that stuff like this happens. I think Waititi is so open about it, is because of this situation
It was a really good movie 🎬 definitely worth the ticket price
Gorr deserved more movies to flesh his character and motivations further. This classic MCU trope of introducing and killing off a villain in the same movie is seriously getting tiring.
Marvel's worst movie...definitely a disappointment
I haven't been this disappointed since my kids were born...
Kind of weird how Taika talked about the VFX ..and some VFX artists actually said working for Disney/Marvel SUCKED.  The timing of that was very curious.
Gorr was the first villain I ever read about, I’ll never forgive the MCU for how this movie did Gorr. Love the MCU but this can’t slide.
I’m really glad that Taika Waititi did brought back Natalie Portman to play Jane Foster and to be the Mighty Thor , I just wish we could’ve seen how she would’ve transformed into Thor without just instantly becomes the hero
Wasn’t as good as Ragnorak but I’d still watch Love and Thunder over the first two Thors. And Mighty Thor Jane was awesome… plus buff af
I don't really get the love for Shang-Chi. it was boring, predictable and Simu's acting was horrible. he was the worst actor in his own movie.
My biggest issues of the movie was Gorr’s limited screentime, the cringey jokes, sidelining Valkyrie, and making Thor a joke yet again. Overall, I loved the movie and Mighty Thor.
Not every film has a plan. - Got it.
I’m going to talk about Thor…a little bit? We get it, you’re making a film. That’s awesome. But I clicked on this because I want to hear you talk about Thor. You start by talking about your film, then say you’ll talk about Thor a little bit and then hit us with a Displate ad? What did I click on?
PS, Spoilers,I love Natalie,but Cancer,and we make jokes?
Audiences have overly criticized Thor 2 and may be paying karma for it. Although Thor 2 didn't have as much fun tone as the other MCUs, it was a huge help to the character's narrative.
At this point we are just going through the motions with MCU movies.
Any excuse to get Chris Stuckmann to pull his terrifying 🗿 face is a good one
2:53 Chris is your left arm ok? Looks quite a bit smaller than your right
So far Chris is the only one giving it a halfway decent positive review every other person that I've watcheda review of it says that this thing sucks ass
As I say with most videos that I see Displate as the sponsor; drill your magnets into the wall.  The adhesive for the magnets have a tendency to dwindle over time, which will result in them falling down.  As someone with about fifteen posters, drilling the magnets into the wall negates that pretty much completely.
Kinda didn’t enjoy the movie very much at all for the first maybe half of it, except the scenes with Gorr, but everything from the black and white fight onwards was pretty damn great.
Chris, I think you should go on tik tok too
Oh my god that movie Fing sucked 🤦‍♂️
Can you please review this movie called RRR on netflix if you are able to find time from your busy schedule, also all the best for Shelby Oaks, cant wait to see it.
It’s not great but I actually liked this movie more than many! Christian Bale played a great villain and the action was very well done! It’s a lot like the Phantom Menace. Silly I’m a few scenes and annoying, but good fun!
Bro so keen for your movie
So it’s pretty obvious they’re gonna continue Thor in the mcu so what I think they should is basically what they did after The Dark World. Get a new director and embrace a different side of the character. The first two films embraced the mythology, the second two embraced the comedy, maybe Thor 5 should do something more fantastical and melodramatic. Something that feels more true to the character at this point in his story cuz Thor’s a dad now.
We’re all excited to see Shelby Oaks Chris !!!! Keep up the good work my guy
You should review The Northman!
It wasn't bad, I laughed and had a fun time with friends. But it wasn't Ragnorock or NWH
Great video as always Chris.  So excited fo Shelby Oaks!  I know your super busy so no biggie but would love to hear you thoughts on Stranger Things new season!
" eat my hammer " 🥴
Chris Stuckmann still trying to cranking them out despite making a movie 👏👏👏👏👏👏 really glad he’s still making these
DO A JURASSIC DOMINION REVIEW ALREADY AND GIVE IT A FAT F
Major dissapointment, marvel movies are getting worse and worse with each one I doubt I'll even watch the next one tbh.
I’m definitely feeling the Disney fatigue rn
I am glad Chris didnt SHILL. Great analysis. other than " a lot of the comedy was funny". smdh. Too much comedy.
WE’VE BEEN WAITING!
Korg was useless in this movie. You erase him from this movie including his narration, the movie would've still look the same. They could've just used removed Korg and give that much screentime for Gorr to shine a bit
I was hoping for a hilariocity review on thor love and thunder
Honestly these Marvel comedies/actions movie are getting very annoying and repetitive
There is no way in Hell,You are going to give this a positive review.I Walked out with about 8 people behind me,Thor peting his hammer and feeding it beer Wtf,Is This Mess
Feels like the all the development that Thor went through in the infinity saga just went down the drain here
I disliked this movie so much
Taika Waititi is just an overrated director. Idk why people look up on him.
Oh  am I earlier  then paul Allan.
Way too much faith in the director on this one.  I couldn't help but wonder if the House of Mouse simply doesn't believe in oversight of it's projects anymore.  The Canon Star Wars movie sequels didn't have an overarching story.  And now Thor doesn't seem to have anyone reading or screening daily's .
When will you review The Quarry (2022) ?
Gorr definitely should have had more scenes doing some actual butchering. To show why he is an actual threat. I mean it took 2 thors and a valkyrie to stop him.
No stranger things review ?
You know your movie is a massive letdown when it gets Chris Stuckmann to make his first video about a movie he didn't like in quite a long time  sidenote: i always thought that the "Not every god has a plan" tagline from the trailer was a Drake joke (he has a song called "God's Plan") but yeah in a way it felt like the movie was criticizing itself
I have alot of issues witht this film but I was still able to have fun with it
Hated it. Hated Ragnarok too.
For me, This movie was extremely disappointing
What studio is the publisher of your movie?  something like paramount,disney and more.
Hearing about all those deleted Gorr scenes was very disappointing...could've really boosted this Movie's score.  The best piece of the movie was barely in it.
This really felt like a cheap Ragnarok retread / knockoff, was really looking forward to this one too
What ever happened to your multiverse of madness spoiler review? I would love to see that still
I actually really liked this movie. My second favorite Phase 4 movie after Spider-Man. It was just a fun movie with some good Laughs. I really liked the art direction they went with in the battle against Gorr making it monochromatic was really cool. Never really liked Jane as a character before but she was great in this without feeling like she was sidelining Thor in his own movie. The ending with where they left Thor off was heartwarming.
I'm very surprised of no Elvis review!!! 😮
It was the second worst Thor movie in my opinion, and it’s a shame because ragnarok was great. It just made Natalie Portman, Russell Crowe and Christian bale look like bad actors, with the terrible jokes and cringey lines
Chris is still cranking them out, despite making a movie.
I really wanted to like the movie but I came out very dissapointed
Chris I can tell how excited you are to release your movie and I’m glad to see that excitement. I can’t wait to get my blu ray👍🏼
0:33 I get what you mean, I'm not a filmmaker but as a musician I can equate what you said to being in a band and recording songs. Even a good song can sound really rough until the recording engineer works their magic.
I’m Too Damn Excited For Shelby Oaks!
Third comment *
Come on Chris I'm Early... Give me some love.  Good work as usual 🔥
Chris has gotten pretty hefty
Babe a new Chris Stuckman came out
I thought the scenes with gorr compared to the goofy rest of the movie, didn’t fit and felt out of place.
Looking forward in seeing Shelby Oaks. Thor sucked IMO
Mcu greatness
I think this is one of the worst MCU offerings in a long time. It’s paper thin which is weird because it’s got everything it needs to be interesting.
Thor became a joke and kind of a dumb character.. last 30 minutes and every scene with Christain bale was great though
I can’t wait to see your film!
Movie was very mid ngl.
I look forward for this movie of his to come out ..so he can stop talking about it constantly
I HOPE IT'S A GOOD MOVIE ......!!!!!!!! Chris: It's not Ragnarok
this movie really sucked
Impressive. Very Nice. Let’s see Paul Allen’s review.
Thor love and mid
Review RRR
Mid movie
Definitely felt a lot missing in this movie
We’re all so excited to watch Shelby Oaks! Keep up the great work as always!
Yo
First
