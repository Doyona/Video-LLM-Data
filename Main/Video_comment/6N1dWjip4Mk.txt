Cannot wait!! Seeing this evening. Catching up on your videos Ryan.
Im gonna cry so ugly hard when Rocket dies.....
They will be replaced by original Guardians from the comics. They showed them before.
I dont think Quill would scream like that over Rocket. It has to be either his sister or his lover.
He looks like MCU's G.O.A.T mega-villain Thanos' lovechild from another multiverse! Perhaps with Storm??? 🤣☹🙄😁😁😁😁😁😁
Wow this is impressive knowledge. Thank u!
So the Russo brothers claim that Nova is in the final battle against Thanos. No on eras found him but supposedly he is there.
That explains why Drax face gets wide. He grew som face fat due to age. Glad Drax is still being played by him.
Hard to believe Will Poulter also played nutsack spiderbite from We're The Millers. They grow up so damn fast.
This GOTG looks sad and disturbing
The High Evolutionary created a Planet similar to earth that his creations could Live.. in Silver Surfer its literally called the Island of Dr.Moreau
Pulp Fiction Easter Egg I heard!!
Excellent job!
The suits look like the among us game
"I bet that dog got a big welcome when he came home!"  "Sure did..."  Lmfao
That is some "version" of the statue of liberty, but it definitely isn't. That skyline doesn't look anything like the skyline behind lady liberty.
7:17 i’ve never heard a more true, accurate description
So pretty much now we have to go along with the fact that Star-Lord and mantis are half brother and half sister.
Something tells me that this going to be the last Marvel movie that James gun completely destroys what is left of the the DC movie universe
with all things considered, i think the “we are groot” line is actually dubbed over. groot may actually be saying it during rockets death scene to comfort him.
Adam Warlock yet another character Marvel totally boned
So they made Adam Warlock look like a kid? Not sure if that's going to hit.
Seeing as you are a Warlock fan and I know little to nothing about him, I want to hear how you think he will be implemented into the MCU
Was wondering who the gold monkey looking guy was..
Yay guardians. Boo blackwashing MsheU.
*Maria BaKAlova :)
Spoilers man, come one!!!
Seriously...that is who they cast as Adam Warlock...who they sidelined in the first place in order to shoehorn Captain Marvel into the MCU too early.
“I bet that dog got a big welcome when he came home…. Sure did!” 😂😂😂 I died 😂
A wise man once said “I’m Mary Poppins y’all!”
Maria Bakalova not Belova :)
Kill the guy in front of his family......Dark...... WTF !!! LMAO
I think there was a short moment in the trailer showing rocket in a bright all white place. Possibly heaven?
Looks horrible
ScreenCrush: "Her and Peter are one of the sweetest couples in the MCU". Me: Literally no recollection of a Gamora and Peter relationship.
Doug's a little gangster I love Doug I want your dog your dog is awesome!
Was the “dark” comment by the dog at the end really necessary? Why would you make a comment like that so randomly? Not cool.
I am praying they dont kill Rocket.... i dont need that
I bet the dog got a big welcome when it got home… Sure it did. 😂😂😂
The Adam warlock arc already happened in the marvel’s guardians of the galaxy video game
Maybe they just didn't re-add the towers out of respect
lol you got me at the end there. "dark" lmao. Great break down video!
I thought you said groot did in the last movie. How does he repeat his line?
Ah it happened again. Second video of yours I watched and then the in-video ad comes in and I just... Can't.
It’s going to be Drax is going to be rocket and Drax!
Groot isn't swoll he's just really handsy. look at his arms in 17:23 and his body is really thin underneath.
I feel like craiglin will become more important to rocket during this movie because everyone forgets that craiglin was there for that moment between yondu and rocket
Why would humans use forks when they have hands? And why would they use plates and tables when they have perfectly good bellies
Just another attack on God. Different looking package.
Can't wait for 3 to come out! That's a, go to the theater event for me
I'm not ready to see rocket die 🥲
ROCKET DIES
Why is Lil Uzi Vert in the thumbnail
“We are Groot” is the craziest thing that has ever given me goosebumps
If a 2 minute trailer needs an 18 minute explainer things have gotten too complicated.
"I bet that dog got a big welcome when he got home?" "Sure he did." lol
Doug needs his own adventure show
I am just ever so glad James Gunn is back to do GOTG Vol 3. Nobody but him can do it. He's literally the heart and soul of the films, and you can tell he's pouring everything into it.   Rocket's death will be a gut punch, but it will be emotionally satisfying.
Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel deserve an award!
Just speculation I believe that the  High evolutionary wanted Peter too as a child but the Ravager's decided to take him too like the option was on the table they did do anything for loot
What if Drax' comment about killing "one stupid guy that no one cares about" is about himself? Jokingly foreshadowing his own death??
Last time I cried was Spider-Man 3 when Harry Died I AM NOT READY FOR THIS
That’s Pom Klementieff being watched by the High Evolutionary, she just does not have her Mantis makeup and VFX
As much as we all hate commercial breaks and ads, I gotta say, Screencrush is KILLING it with the transitions. Doug googling something he doesn't believe to transition is perfect
The scene of rocket laying down is with the high evolutionary before he is freed by lady lyla
Maria Bakalova* not Balova
no where in the marvel universe has it been said thats groots son 😂😂😂😂 thats the same groot just reborn
Rockets death is in the comics.
Was the dog always part of the show? I find it annoying.
Gamora looks smokin hot
I mean I think groot should shout out we are family instead of groot……. Lol
Another movie that won’t live up to the hype
Gemora was destroyed with Thanos when someone used the ifinity stone to send everyone who does not belong here away. She disappeared just like everyone els. So how could she now be back? Sinds both versions of gemoria are dead or disappeared by the infinity stones.
In the comics Adam warlock is a man that is phenomally strong. Not a gay looking kid. Way to go Disney for ruining another marvel character
Maybe they’ll introduce the missing gem/stone and make that what’s in his head?
I feel like James Gunn said gamora is the leader of the ravagers now
I fell asleep wa5ching GotG 1... twice. These movies never made it for me.
anyone else noticed that each uniform looks like it has has a different emblem ? or just perspective ?
I think the pre-smart Rocket looks more like a polecat than anything. This is also supported by Rocket's line in an earlier movie: "I'M NOT A RACCOON!"
The High Evolutionary creations are called "New Men.".
Something I didn't think about until now: Peter's always been stuck in the 80s. The song throughout the trailer is Spacehog's "In the Meantime," released in the 90s. I think that was more than obviously intentional. Not only was he using newer technology to listen to his music, but his music has started to progress through the decades. The song in the trailer itself is evidence of Peter's growth as a human.
Because the Gunn Bros. have worked on all the movies.. I feel they're the most tightly knit out of all the series..
The Guardians have a "headquarters" xD
I think you may have slightly mispronounced the actor that voices Cosmo! Her name is Maria Bakalova, it sounded like you said "Belova" which is Yelena's (Pugh's Widow) name.
11:59 what is that the otter riding an ostrich cartoon? Seems like South Park?
Dude, how old are you?
Hi Ryan
Love seeing your enthusiasm for Warlock. Don't know much about the character myself, but now you've got me excited!
🤣 Spanus
I feel a bit apprehensive about these "Animen". See, I've seen several variations of the animal/human concept, in art and anime and film.  To me, one of the better directions to go in, is the Lion-king/Zootopia route.  When you put "animal heads" on fully human bodies, no amount of fur is going to make it look any less weird.  This works in Moon Knight where the "gods" are supposed to be strange, foreign, alien, and weird looking, to an extent. It works for them. Though for me the Hippo was pushing it a little.  But, when you take a fully animal model and stretch it a bit to make it able to walk and move in a more human-like way, that sends a completely different message.  Having something that looks human but clearly isn't gets really close to the uncanny valley. Having a human body with a non-human head is borderline body-horror territory.  Having, like they did in Zootopia, have animal characters be made incrementally more human until they had a good balance. That can work.  It's also like there's a human "inside" the animal. We can clearly see it isn't human... but it acts, behaves, walks and moves like a human does. That's what I mean by "sends a completely different message".  I hope that we don't see to much of these "animen" because... I'll be honest... I don't like the look of them.
Technically the Statue of Liberty always welcomed aliens
Adam Warlock looks HORRIBLE 🤣🤣🤣
The line "We've been gone for quite a while" Was also referring to the snap. In which most of them were gone for 5 years and therefore the team as a whole were gone.
If he had an established title, that means he has diplomatic immunity, right? :D  (yes, I know they are a scam.)
I'm expecting Adam Warlock to be nerfed and played for comedic relief.
What do you mean that’s the son of Groot? In the comics he’s always just Groot. As long as the tiniest sliver survives, he’s able to grow back from it, he’s still Groot
Did he say anus portal?
If they kill rocket… I will riot. Just kill drax so he can be with his family, and maybe nebula too so the stakes are higher but let quill and gamora ride off and run knowhere together and have rocket groot and kraglin recruit some new heroes to keep guarding the galaxy, maybe Adam warlock will join
Giant what portal
I dont get the comments saying I cant wait to find out about rockets backstory. Just read the comics.
Those space suits remind me of the vespa crew in book of boba Fett...💚🇬🇧🌱
Another view might be that James Gunn may leave marvel with a doozie because he's off to work for the competition?
are we really going to hype up the villain again?  They are going to kill him off at the climax of the film.... I don't want it to be this way... but marvel has been great at killing off great villains and no using them to their full potential... I got faith that Gunn will do it right, but i've been burned before.
Adam warlock IS awesome, but the mcu has lately taken awesome characters and put sh1t actors in the rolls that don't even closely resemble the characters (Namor? fat? short and flabby) and the actor they choose for warlock is terrible looking for the role.
Mate please stop with the dogs voice.
@ScreenCrush why aren't you covering "The Peripheral" series on Amazon?..... please do it's a phenomenal show by Westworld creators
Saw their X-mas special and is left me ready for more
I think what you say is an anus in space is actually an eye of a celestial and that prison may be in that Celestial also, I don't know I'm still trying to figure it out.
Bruh that ad was way out of hand
i want to see starlord's original weapon the element gun
if the space anus is how they get to counter-earth, and the ship is shown on counter-earth, why would they be jumping out of the ship in EVA suits towards the anus?
Honestly, I have been supportive and understanding towards Marvel/Disney and their adaptation of the comics to film, and they have been somewhat accurate on most characters, like Iron Man. However, I am seeing more and more the MCU becoming an unrecognizable story filled with unrecognizable characters because of 'what'? They believe that people won't like the characters if they look like they do in the comics? It's a comic book story, not reality, so the 'theatrical' Marvel universe should be the 'comic' universe. That means having a five hundred foot cosmic giant in purple and blue consuming planets, and the High Evolutionary should be a character in red and white 'armor' and a handle on top of his head, NOT a reimagined version of the character. If they do this to Galactus, I will be done with the MCU.
Dang Doug went dark there at the end 🤣 I can't wait for this movie, it comes out my birthday weekend so HBD to me !!! I'm going to be a blubbering mess after seeing this movie, OH THE FEELS !!!
Ryan—aren’t you a former teacher? Doesn’t promoting your VPN ad, saying you can use it to deceive your location, throw up some unethical and immoral flags?  You just issued a statement on one of your other ads. Come on, do better.
I believe the planet is probably Half world, Rocket's planet of origin from GotG, and he's not with them when they land.
Spoiler, Dave Bautista, this will be his final performance in the Guardians of the Galaxy his character will die heroically, and repeat these words first heard in  Guardians of the Galaxy 2014, I will fight beside you, and in the end, I will see my wife and daughter again. As for Rocket, he explained in Guardians of the Galaxy 2014,Oh what the hell. I don't get that long a lifespan, anyway. Keep in mind Rocket at this time is becoming an old man, and happy to be back in the arms of his lover, think retirement. About Groot, we have meet baby Groot, Teenager Groot, and now we meet the young adult Groot, and also remember the original Groot was hundreds of years old
Come on….Mantis reveals that she is Peter’s sister….we think someone dies in this movie…it’s gotta be Mantis. They created that emotional attachment and gave the fans a reason to invest more in her so that her death hits harder.
DEADPOOL 3 THEORY..  What if becoz of Deadpool 2 ending where Deadpool just goes to different timelines and changes everything is the reason for all the branches in timeline at LOKI 's ending... Maybe THE ONE WHO REMAINS has no idea what to expect from Deadpool after he gets the time watch??  May be thts how TVA catches Deadpool and he runs from them to a different timeline and finds Wolverine and they run on a road trip...
Sovereign was GOTG2 you need another vacay bro
@15:45 It really would be nice if that was the Soul Gem and he was able to reunite Gamora’s soul with her time displaced self at the end of the movie.
Nice talking doggie
I feel like there's no real point to it. They killed off Yondu, and he was one of the biggest parts of it next to Peter Quill.
I know you have to make money, but I pay for YouTube premium for a reason. Your annoying ads are ruining the experience of watching your videos
Movie looks exciting. Thanks for the details. Cool video.
I want the Starjammers!
This is sad this is the end of my favorite movie collection.😞
Thumbnail made me think about his father, alarz or however you spell em
RIP Laika
I love your videos but them 30 minutes sponsor ad between your 15 minutes video is annoying asf
I hope there is an important role for Karen Gillan, she's great!
I think Drax is going to die because David Batista don’t want to play the role anymore from what I’ve heard 🤷🏽‍♂️ just a theory thou
THATS PROBABLY WHERE RINTRAH IS FROM
I think we can describe Adam Warlock as the Marvel writers at the time having no idea what to do with the character for about two and a half decades. It's why he is so convoluted.
Can you believe they took the magus  froe away for a man bun before man buns were "cool"
Maybe it's setting up the annihilators...if star lord survives.
In the Guardians of the Galaxy game from Telltale Games, we meet Lylla in one of Rocket's flashbacks, I don't remember well how it was but they were escaping their captivity.
ok, the HE didnt create rocket. also, the HE doesnt create cyborgs or augments. he EVOLVES creatures.
What if Adam Warlocks forehead gem *is* an infinity stone from another timeline/universe?
Among us
Gotta love DOUG
If they kill rocket,I’M JUST GONNA CRAWL INTO A HOLE AND DIE!!!!
@screencrush SO YOU GUYS PROMOTE SCAMS. “Lord of bs” established title? EXPLAIN?!
I think Adam Warlock has the Ego Stone in his head
Space sphincter
Can Drax please have some character growth? Seriously, this isn't at all what his character is like in the comics, does he have to be a moron forever? It was funny at first but it's getting old.
I LOVE THANOS ✝️👸🏻🛡🗡🔥
13:12 I would be so sad if mantis dies
Dude drop the dog voice
Am I the only one who thinks that spaceship resembles the Brood Queen?
Dark, Doug... but still adorable.
I have  a theory and its that rocket a Groot both were made from the high evolutionary and the reason why rocket is the only one who remembered was because that version of Groot died and the new Groot didn't come from the high evolutionary .
Why was Gamorra there? She died for the Infinity Stone. How is she back now?? I admit, it looks interesting but I will make 100% sure that Taiko has not been near the director's chair for a mill. kilometres before I trust that trailer enough to buy a ticket.
Adam warlock suit is a bit to much I feel like his golden beautiful skin doesn’t look and I’m wondering what’s in his head
It look like Peter sacrificed himself to save gamora
Question. If the new guardians will be comprised of Stallone’s crew from the ending of vol.2. Will Michelle Yeoh exist in both Shang Chi and Guardians?
That doesn't look like Nebula carrying Quill at 8:18. The body shape and facial structure are wrong. Maybe it's a relative? Or, more than likely, maybe it's a body double (strong enough to carry Chris Pratt) that hasn't been fully fixed to look like Karen Gillan, yet.
Does anyone else think the colored spacesuits are a reference to the famous Pac-Man fanart "The Madness of Mission Six"? It would make sense, given Quill's use of a Pac-Man avatar in his battle with Ego in volume 2.
More than one will die, Drax will as well.. Bautista is done with the role altogether he wants to move on from Marvel. He wears a sweater in the holiday special and a suit in this one I'd assume cuz it takes wayyy too long to do all that makeup
What?  Mantis is who's brother?  Destroy destroy destroy
"Sure it did."  Hahahaha
0:28 Additionally, an in-universe explanation is that most of the Guardians were blipped. 9:43 From what I’ve heard, Gamora is now leading the Ravagers.
hopefully it doesnt suck like every other thing Marvel has done in the past year
Wait no Beta Ray Bill?
I would the Adam guy would be better looking
For real, teach your dog to high five. Forcing it is so sad.
Also a vpn isn’t gonna stop someone from hacking your pc through a wifi connection 😂
Not gonna lie. Rockets backstory is nice an all but definitely not a movie worth occurance 😂 like a top 3 Disney + show would have been top tier for his bqckstory
"sure it did" NOOO
Since this is the last guardians of the galaxy movie what will happen to them in the future of marvel would they be able to pop out again in future films or is it that the complete end???!
I find guardian holiday more entertaining than last Thor movie
Groot has become General Grievous with guns and not lightsabers
Actually the animal people of counter Earth are not animal human hybrids they are actually  Evolved animals who have taken humanoid form and intelligence.
Have you watched the music video for the Spacehog song they use in the this trailer? I find it interesting that the guitar player has what looks to me like a silver surfer statue on his guitar amp.
I think it's inevitable that the Guardians won't survive in their entirety. But I'm hoping that a few of them can survive and continue on. Side note, shouldn't Gamora be a target for the TVA, or did the Loki finale imply that variants and people in the wrong timelines are free do to what they want?
Is that Luke Cages brother?
Groot looks like he’s been taking steroids
I like that they made special comfy clothes for Drax to not iritate his sensible nipples.
I dont know whats worse, the amount of things goten wrong about the movie or the fact that a vpn was just made out to be some form of ultimate protection for a computer, please saps a vpn CANNOT protect you pc or laptop on a wifi network, a vpn just lures people into a false sense of security.
667th comment to prevent the rise of Satan
Adam was made to stop the fantastic 4.
I LOVE ADAM WARLOCK.  He's my most favourite Marvel character, so your quick synopsis of his early story was splendid to see!!!  Glad to see another Adam Warlock fan!
Its was a good time for this trailer cause every time i open utube i see a guy talkin bout tarantino ''destroying'' mcu im kinda tired...tho i did hate phase 4 except for loki
I love Doug.
I have a feeling we lose Drax not Rocket
I think rocket gonna die in this movie
i think we're supposed to THINK Rocket dies, but it's Peter that will end up dying, and Gamora becomes the new Star-Lord.
Warlock looks terrible.
Very weird to say the new suits look like Rocket in the comics when they were the entire team's uniforms in 2008. What's going on there? What's the deal with that?
Counter Earth was featured in the Spiderman animated series in the 90s. I wonder if they'll still have the futurist weapons and vehicles while remaining in an older decade, similar to Blade Runner
The dog is really annoying
The Sovereign are from the second movie, not the first.
Ive gone from maybe watching it, to definatley giving it a miss...
"Pete" Is that the 1st time Rocket's called Him That!? Can't wait to see a Proper MCU Film instead of The Message! Gunn knows it's His last and what he's Doing! So he's gonna go out With a Bang! Plus Guardians 1 and 2 Are Defo Top 10 and 1 Top 5 For Me! Cheers SC 🍻
Gamora was an assassin yes... but she was dominantly a tool for her fathers purposes. "For hire". She wasnt some bounty hunter independent of her father. She served her father and wasnt available for others to just hire. She wasnt hired by Ronan. Thanos was trading w Ronan... retrieve the stone and he would destroy Zandar. "Here are my daughters to assist you on your part of our bargain". And the bounty on the stone is still not hiring her as an assassin.  She became known as the deadliest woman in the galaxy serving her father.
Peter and Groot doing a bullet sprinkler like Jake Peralta and Charles Boyle. Awesome.
I wonder if Peter is crying out at another version of his Mother dying in Half World? Maybe all the people in half world are clones of the real world?
You are trending!
I haven't heard of anyone mentioning the terrible make up job on Adam Warlock's face 🤷🏻‍♂️
The actor for adam warlock is the first MCU cast who I feel eek about
Starlord = dead Racoon = dead Drax = dead Gamora = dead  Nebula= dead  New guardians are coming with Mantis and tree guy as the only survivors
Marvel comic writers were doing acid back then i swear
Seeing Rocket little from behind then the front with his big eyes is such an aw moment. This movie is gonna be a tear jerker.
Drax might die too because Dave Batista said that after this film he won’t be coming back to play drax
I’m extremely hyped for this movie! I’ve always loved the Guardians and it’ll be super emotional and wholesome to see their final adventure
I really want Rocket to have a solo movie. I’d love to see him team up with a lesser known character n do a buddy-cop film with Groot in the background being Groot.
First the posters. Now the Wi-fi. Careful Mr. Sock, careful.
The colored space suits look like the celestial's face from eternals
I think drax will die since Bautista said he can’t do the role anymore but this movie is going to be a massive emotional gut punch
I'm sorry, they can spray him with as much gold paint as they want but he ain't never guna look like Adam Warlock.
* Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.   (Proverbs 4:23) * For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.   (Romans 8:13) * The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.   (Romans 13:12)
7:44 and no one is wondering where the TVA is?? To arrest her like they did Loki?? I smell a plot whole already……
The new ship is called Bowie
People have no problem with 2014 Gomorrah hooking back up with the Guardians but drawn the line with 2012 Loki reuniting with Thor. 🤦🏻‍♀️ usually saying “that’s not Thor’s Loki so it’s dumb”. Same argument with her but people love it. I don’t get it.
Ummm unless something changed RECENTLY. nordVPN doesn’t let you get alternant shows on Netflix. Surfshark doesn though.
I love how the frame shot shifts when Ryan goes all Rob Jefferson and shxt… this was the perfect moment to go, maaaaaaaaaaan, letmetellyasuuuuuuuuuumn.
“I bet that dog got a big welcome when it came home” “Sure it did” Yikes. Yeah. Some things ya just don’t want to know.
Doug,  I have a project where I need you to do the vocals. Tried sending multiple messages but I guess your paw is inept... Lmk if you're interested 🙂
I think it is a real stone. They always come back
More Easter eggs  1 gold people both them are academy 2 Gamora is back she not long died team are back together again  3 rocket story cute and sad story  4 Groot say i am Groot father sad that guardians of the galaxy 1 and 2 and avengers infinitely war  5 rocket will died  Peter Quill rocket more than raccoon he our friend i and marvel fans drax and Mantis Peter Quill lost Tony stark and blue alien father Ego  6 thor back guardians of the galaxy never see thor love and thunder thor and Peter Quill good friends teammates 7 infinity gauntlet see infinitely  gauntlet on avengers infinitely war and avengers endgame infinitely stones in avengers age of Ultron wandavision Agatha Harkness what her Powers come from trying help her Wanda lost her parents and her brother and vision Wanda lost everything lost herself herself Powers on control her Powers make this worst
Pretty cool video thanks for the info.
LOL Ryan, when you do that moment when you 'don't' talk about the fate of the first dog in space.  Doug will be heartbroken if he finds out.
This is boring.☹️
I never knew that Steve Carell's lesser known brother still had enough clout to be hosting a popular YouTube channel. 🤔😆
I think this will be better than any movie in phase four! At least I hope it will LOL
Yeah these Younghans don’t know how to make good movies are stealing from the old people that used to make good movies they should learn how to create their own movies and I always blame and cover or something I should be still making movies most of the Younghans are cowards they’re frayed of everything
"I'm done runnin" by Rocket is the highlight for me 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"I'm done runnin" by Rocket is the highlight for me 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"I'm done runnin" by Rocket is the highlight for me 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"Oh, I bet that dog got a big welcome when he came home!" 💔💔
If I use VPN to access a Netflix movie in another country will that movie be available in English?
WOAH, Doug went a little crazy at the end there, lol.
2:15 isnt that the alien world?
Honestly, I think it’s Drax.  The response from Mantis and the rumors about him not wanting to do the part.  Just my thoughts.
FYI drax,I loved Thanos and always will
Boy that's one Dangerous little dog!!!!😵🐺
i’m never going to see that portal as anything other than an an*s now thanks 😂
Drax.  Please, in Soul World...DRAX!!!!  Right there in the purple cape.  And gloves. I know.  It doesn't look like Drax. But it is. I have the original (I bought it when it came out...) SHOW US MORE DRAX!!!
The spacesuits in the trailer remind me of that Travis Pitts picture.
"Oh I'm sure that dog got a big welcome when it came home!" "Sure it did..."  this was a very underrated quip
Poor Doug just doesn’t understand what happened to the Russian dog 🤣🤣🤣
Another thing is the Guardians Logo colors are resemble Rocket. Volume 1 Groot Died & the Logo was his form. Volume 2 had the Blue and Red and Yondu Died. This could be the end of Rocket as we know him
With all this Talkin may as well keep the kids watching fairy Odd Parents.
This fox in the movie with red n blue he must have been in the Newspapers lol
Why they put him (lil grout) in the shawman toilet paep?
I going to lose it if Rocket dies in this one.
Anyone surprised we got a full trailer instead of a teaser? Very interesting
Is it just me or are the space suits the same color as the stones
You've got to learn your s*** before you make videos The new ship is the Bowie and their home base is nowhere They bought it from the collector
Doug chill
The anus portal looks like rocks to me. Not some kind of monster. Lol
The rock don't have aging problems and still doesn't need a shirt. Hahahaha!! They're about a similar age. Lol
Hey everyone! Check out the community tab where discussion over ScreenCrush endorsement of established titles. ScreenCrush is active in the comments continuing to defend ET while disregarding and often insulting the intelligence of this audience. Just letting everyone know and suggesting to check out some of the many other marvel/breakdown channels that have heard their audience and parted ways with ET.
Im not sure if soulmate correlates with mother or sister
i think the part of being gone for a long time means the blip
I’m waiting for Jack of hearts to be casted at some stage, he’s my favourite character of all time
High 5 Doug. Hope you sorted out your hard drive.
But why was 2014 Gamora exempt from the final snap?
Looking forward to Peter Gunn's last work in the MCU. Everything since Endgame has sucked so bad I cancelled Disney+. Gunn will be a great loss, the lack of the work from Favreau, the Whedon's, the Russo's, have been greatly felt.
It’s not Manhattan.
You just ruined Doug......
My guess is, that scene with Rocket is when he loses most of the team and hates the fact he can't die. As I understand, James Gunn will make sort of free opening, for future Guardians teams, but it's better for him to leave characters that can be easily recreated with CGI or different actresses or actors:  like Rocket, Groot, Mantis. And others like Drax, Peter, Gamorra, are most suited to "leave". Hard to say what JG may do with Nebula, though. So I think Peter might reborn into some sort of being, like his father, Drax will probably die, Gamorra probably leaves for good right after. And I think she might stay with new "Peter". Nebula is a mystery, she is good for any outcome: leading new Guardins, staying with her sister or hiding somewhere(In case Gamorra dies and Peter not around). And Adam is a good choice to succeed Peter
Your transition game into the the product placement is unmatched 👌🏿
Oh shit the little doh gonna start sliding on mothafuckas soon lol
The ship they called “the Bowie”
Racoons only get 20 years of life in captivity. Rocket is getting pretty old.
The Guardians is just how F4 should feel in the movies, a FAMILY.
Rocket says in 1 of the previous movies that Groot had become a complete D bag since he got small giving the appearance that it is the same Groot not his son or offspring
I hope the teasing of Rocket's death is a misdirect and that another character we aren't expecting to die, dies. I'm gonna be so upset if they take Rocket away.
Do you intentionally mispronounce things? Your script editor and producer need to make sure you pronounce names and character names correctly
Thanks Ryan. I love inside baseball!!!
I love how they've named the ships: The Milano, the Benatar, and now the Bowie
2nd movie not first
"Dark" lmao
please do the Transformers Rise of The Beasts trailer breakdown, bcus some ppl are confuse about why theres optimus truck and optimus gorilla in one scene/movie? i thought the Gorilla is the truck and the Chetor is the bumblebee
I'm a HUGE Guardian's of the Galaxy Fan and I have been waiting 6 long years for this movie 🎬 🎞 🎥 to drop!! So pumped for this movie!!! Going to get Pre Sale Tickets 🎟 as soon as possible!!!!!
Tha Laika reference 🤣🤣  “I bet that dog got a big welcome when they came home” ☠️☠️
Not so sure that suburb is stuck in the '80's - The house on the right has solar panels on the roof. Also, I wonder if the brightly colored spacesuits are a nod to George Pal's "Destination Moon"?
Adam Warlock looks like Bidens Nuclear waste luggage stealer
I genuinely don’t get how people are mad at Peter from Infinity War in the first place, Doctor Strange literally said that it was “the only way” numerous times
There is a super annoying ad from 2:20 to 4:00 I suggest everyone skip that
if rocket passes, it'll be like the flood gates opened. bunch of crying going on in that theater for sure.
That’s not the NYC skyline though.
I like Dark Doug.
Drax and Rocket dying is absolutely going to destroy me.
Laika died from overheating due to the lack of knowledge to de-orbit. She was never expected to make it back :( 8:29
Are you actually friends with Eric Voss?
I havent heard anyone mention that Ravager captain doing Dr. Strange type magic WTF is up with that.
I hope they at least are in secrets war and such
I still got a bad taste in my mouth about Peter in Endgame.
Unfortunately Disney/Marvel is crashing and a lot of this stuff will never come to fruition.
"Anus Portal"
Jeez they really dropped the ball on the High Evolutionary costume and design. He looks nothing like what he should, I never expect the characters to look just like they do in the comics but man, this isn't even close, he's more like an alternate Kang to be honest.
Is it just me or does Adam Warlock look a lot like the creepy boomerang kid from 'The Road Warrior' ?
Jeez Doug, chill lol
I don’t know how much credit you get for this, but the Doug bits always kill me 😂
am i the only one notice after the xmas special of guardians and this vol. 3, groots face is somewhat similar to vin diesel's face?
So you not gone do a transformers video(
Your quick
A lot of the scenes, like the anus, the red shiny flat surface and them bouncing on a planet surface seems like scenes for the Guardians of the Galaxy video game so I'll bet some of that story is used here as well.
I’m very worried about Rocket
"I bet that dog got a huge welcome when it got home" LOL
Now. Now please. is NOW good? That would be cool. So yeah. Now? Thanks.
Why should people listen to your channel if you can’t even be bothered to research the costumes? Honesty this channels so much worse than many others and I think people know that now
If rocket dies i'm gonna cry
They bring Adam warlock and then there was talks about king thanos so that might be a next movie for Adam
Lol that Laika joke was too good. Dark... but good haha
One thing i just noticed on my...third.. fourth, i can stop any time i want to.. viewing is that Lyra seems to have a mechanical arm/hand she's hugging rocket with
I’m really hyped for this film.
"We're all mad at Peter..."  Please don't presume to speak for me, Screencrush.
The Link for Nord worked last night but won't work now
Adam warlock terrible casting dam another miss
Since Rocket is from Half-world, similar planet to Counter earth, are they going to change that up and say the H.E. made him? If so I hope we still see Wal Rus and Blackjack O’Hare fight rocket
i wish thor 4 had this groot
Maybe it will be revealed that Rocket ended up stealing off of the sovereign in the second movie because those batteries they had were helping to fuel the high evolutionary with his experiments
Sure it did😅😂😂😂😂
That Groot and Quill back to back scene makes me believe, at that point, those are the only 2 Guardians left. Batista said he can't keep the workouts up anymore to be Drax. They took Stark and Widow and Cap away in the same movie. I think we're going to lose a few Guardians in this one.  :(
Rocket can't grow back like Groot. :(  I don't want Rocket to die.
You know what I love about the Guardians? They don't have advertise scams like Established Titles.
I’m about to date myself but this must be done. All I need to see is Magus with the Michael Brady Fro!!!!
I’m thinking we’ll get to Rocket’s backstory and creation also I think Rocket dies in this movie as well .
"Dark" I laughed so f-in  hard
Yay! Another sad MCU movie! My kids are going to love it!!! </sarcasm>
mf looks like lil uzi vert with that shit stuck to his forehead
the first thing my 17 yr old son said after we watched the Trailer was "oh no!! I think Rocket is going to die!!" His reasoning included the fact that the Marvel intro logo is a brownish color, and they almost always make the intro background color mirror a person that dies in whatever movie the intro is attached to.
It would be good if Adam warlock falls in with high evolutionary because he becomes aimless and lost after the snap and the loss of any mentoring
14:27 we as a collective of fans complain too much about heroes always having to fight the evil versions of themselves to accept Adam Warlock literally fighting himself.
The comics universe is way too dense and weird for me.  Glad we've got you here to summarize it!
It wont be the end of the guardians  It’ll just be the end of James Gunn’s run with the team   For example, Bendis took over as Avengers writer with his New Avengers run  Then Hickman took over New Avengers as writer   It wont be the end of the team itself, just this current version of the team
Just the trailer gives me chills and tears lol
I Think NO MORE Horror Films For Doug!
That dog bit is so played out.
In Guardians 1, when Rocket said how he was taken apart and put back together over n over. Made me wanna slap tf outta his creator.
Adam Warlock ( the Perfect man in the universe) This version of Adam Warlock look like he just came out of Rehab.
It’s going to be drax that dies
Among us reference
I'm so excited!
That "new" ship is the bowie seen in the Christmas special
I'm pretty sure the colorful space uniforms was a nod to Among Us which was played so much over the pandemic as the film was delayed.
That's actually a version of earth that is modern but also stuck in the 80s everything that happened on earth happens there too but fashion is slower
Love these breakdowns…but you really got stop the bit where you have the dog talk in a cartoon voice. It adds nothing and is just embarrassing.
DON’T HATE ON MY BOI EM FOR THAT VENOM SONG BRUH…THAT WAS ALL BARS HOMIE
The Guadians' new ship is called the Bowie 🔥
I've been waiting for Adam Warlock since he was teased in GotG 2, I was hoping he would make an appearance in Infinity War, but this is good too.
I think the new ship is called the Bowie (at least according to the Holiday Special.  Quinn says 'Prepare the Bowie for his transport back to Earth"  probably meaning the ship they used)
Baby Rocket…😍
First movie? You just continue to lose credibility.
It was actually the 2nd movie where they pissed off the  sovereign lol
That 👎 was me
It's amazing what these shills will say for a marvel tote bag and free movie tickets
Dog gonna tear that sock TF up!!!
Rockets dying.
Actually humans ARE animals.
So after saving the universe, Star Lord was able to acquire vast property (Knowhere) while Falcon cant get a loan. Got it.
Peter and Rocket both die. The End.
Rocket said he was diassembled and reassembled alot of times. In here he says, he has a very short lifespan. Maybe he will be reborn in the movie.
Ryan just reaches touch for me
Does there need to be a story behind what's on Adam's forhead given there are no infinity stones but it's replaced with something?
In wanda vision, sheild found a way to harness Wanda's powers given to her by the mind stone to power white vision. If the sovereign can create Adam warlock, could/should they be able to do something similar?
Wow Doug, dark indeed.
We don't know that baby rocket is on earth. Its a dark dingy mad scientist cage, they have those on most planets and some space ships.  Quill thinks he looks like a raccoon, Drax thinks he looks just like some species his kids roasted over a fire when camping. So much like the raccoon and tanuki there's some convergent evolution going on here.   I don't think he's going to die. When he says we'll fly away together one last time, its a flashback. He's naked, and probably talking to lyra/ whatever they name the otterly adorable otter he's hugging. In the scene in G2 when he's fighting with Quill over the pilots seat, he said that he was literally made to fly. The high evolutionary needed a pilot (either for his big ship or some defense fighters) so he's enacting an escape plan there. We know rocket makes it out. Lyra.. not so much.
Adam Warlock looks horrible
The guardians films have easily been my favourites- I really hope this isn’t the last one, but it sure won’t be the same without James Gunn directing.
I kind of thought that gamora with the Polaroid was a reference to memento because they both are people who have had lapses in their memory
I have a Theory: Nebula was "evolved" by tech, what if the way Thanos made Gamora stronger was with the help of the High Evolutionary?
Ratcatcher II is in the movie. Who does she play?
Lika never came home.. but it did find a happy dog planet. In 50 years they were set to all come to earth and bite everybody.. but at the moment their dancing
I’m not emotionally ready for any of the guardians to die. Especially not Rocket
My question is why can't Warlock heal or resurrect whoever dies in the movie? He has that power.
Adam Warlock is definitely Quills son.  In some way.  Iesha was very fascinated with what she felt in Quills DNA. And she flirted with him in the scene where they were talking about reproducing the old fashion way.  I say she got his DNA and used it to make Adam Warlock.  And was able to use the celestial gene to make Adam so powerful.
Dark Doug!!!
8:42...um who's gonna tell him?
The suits look like a reference to Among Us.
How much for the dog
I liked the Adam Warlock fanboy moment here.  I can't imagine they can touch on too much of Infinity War/Crusade in the movies, but it is fun to imagine.
Their ship is named in the special. The Bowie.
It's weird. Adam is meant to be perfect but then they decide to hire a aardman studios figure to play the character. It's weird.
Predictions:  Deaths: Drax and Nebula with a fake out for Rocket   Rocket on the table is talking to Lyra and set in the past, and it will foreshadow the ending of him leaving the guardians with her.   Peter will not be back with Gamora he will learn to let her go  Peter assembles a new team of guardians including Adam and Nova with the left over guardians, mantis, cosmo and kraglin
great video, loved all the facts
Maria BAKALOVA
When I saw the Animen, I couldn't help but think that they could actually Maybe pull off a series based on the comic SAGA.
I’m more attached to the guardians than 90% of phase 4
I'm moving from Marvel to DC after the movie comes out. Lately Marvel content has been...not was I hoped for, except the xmas special and, I hope, this movie
I was dying over Doug’s innocence in regards to Laika’s fate.
Your saying more race swopping?.... Nice, another movie to skip.
I believe Adam warlock dose indeed have the soul gem in his head he did not come out of his incubator untill the soul gems were returned and we all know the soul gem can't just be returned instead I believe Steve tried to return it and the gold guys got a hold of it to bring Adam to life
Bet that dog got a big welcome , poor dog
Definitely hyped for Adam warlock
That new ship is The Bowie.
Surely can't be any worse than the 2nd one!
The Ravager symbol on their uniforms has the Nova Corps symbol in the middle of it... so the two officially teamed up?
61 easter eggs for a trailer. This is why the MCU sucks now. Can't simply watch a movie and enjoy it for what it is. No, you need to know about every little thing. It's exhausting and lame. Guardians 3 and Antman 3 is the end for me. MCU is corny af now.  Btw the giant anus portal being a portal doesn't quite make sense. Why would the Guardians be shown landing on counter earth in their new ship but later on have to go to this portal outside of their ship wearing space suits? Calling it now, Nebula, Drax, and Rocket all die. Dave Bautista has said this is the last time he will play Drax. Karen Gillian 6 months ago on Instagram basically said she is done as Nebula. I could see Mantis being killed off too but after her recent reveal being Quill's sister maybe they keep her around but idk. Gunn has stated multiple characters die in this film. And I don't see any other director wanting to follow Gunn with this franchise. It's the end of the Guardians.
When you called Cosmo a "space dog" i was immediately reminded of rocket fighting in Wakanda "get some get some get some"
I'm loving that the Abrams puppet is a reoccurring character now.
I think the high evolution is the one who gave nebulas her prosthetics. Hence why gamoura will be after him
I’d be down for a ravagers movie
The skyline behind the Statue of Liberty is jersey city , not Manhattan
Will we see Howard the Duck ?
Isn't the statue of liberty still part of the bay? Thought the "Hudson" begins further north,?
Just don't kill rocket, please, please, please.
Space anus = "Spanus", surely?
Rocket is definitely going to die. It was clear from the first movie that his arc was set up with him sacrificing himself for the team in the thrid movie.
The trailer is very cool. Gamora's new design is great. Drax and Rocket Raccoon will probably die
Drax is wearing a suit. But what about his sensitive nipples he mentioned in gotg2?! 😂
I guess you like Adam Warlock ;)
Let’s do this boys ❤
Will we finally see what happens to nova Corps in infinity war
Will we finally see what happens to nova Corps in infinity war
Will we finally see what happens to nova Corps in infinity war
Trailer just shows how Gunn is superior to Waititi in every way
Bautista looks noticeable heavier in this one, I don't blame him for wanting to wear a shirt.
Is that heckle dog
Haha they have a "Head"quarters
I dont think that the orange suits are prison jump suits i think they are the under layers to their space suits. Drax has a hole in his like he got hit by something on their way into what ever the room is that looks very similar to egos ship.  Once inside they could ditch their space gear.
The space suits are the colours of Pac-Man and the Ghost, Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde
If Rocket dies in this movie, I will cry. I'm not ready for this 😭😭😭😭😭😭.
Isn't counter earth also on the Spiderman Unlimited series? Or is that too obscure?
They met the sovereign in vol 2 not the first movie
I think the multi colored suits is an Among Us reference
Where can I get one of those custom keyboards made for dogs? Like Doug must be using, It's not like he could use a regular keyboard. I mean he is a dog.
Dang that puppy is a Gangsta.
The guy peter is tackling looks very familiar to the one xandarian he tries to sell the orb/power stone in the first part
The talking dog was bad.   The sock puppet was too much.   No matter if his ideas are good, his weirdness ruins it.
James Gunn has been on 🔥🔥🔥Holiday Special The Sucide Squad Peacemaker now Guardians Vol 3 and I loved Vol 1 and 2 can't wait to see what he does next with the DCU!  Hopefully Blackest Night or Kingdom Come.
Rocket or drax dies.
Not telling Doug about Laika was the good choice 😆
They allwearthose classic uniforms in the comics. Not just roket. Who is double checking your vids, Doug?
I need more breakdowns on this trailer. There was not enough in this video!
You forgot to mention that they're wearing Among Us space suits.
The guardians game use that storyline of Adam warlock and rhw church. It's a pretty good version of it was a very underrated game
What makes me DEFINITIVELY think that Rocket bites it is that guns are Rocket’s thing, and Groot is his buddy, so why isn’t he with Groot shooting guns on his shoulder?
If he kills Rocket ...James will have a bad day.
This man made a longer Nord VPN add in a 17 minute long video about a sub 2 minutes trailer....  What have we become?
Amogus
Wasn't Magus interdimentional? And not just a future version of Adam? He was from the Cancerverse I thought?
I really don't want rocket to die 🥺  He's my fav gaurdian and one of my fav characters in MCU
So is the 80s going to defeat the High Evolutionary like dance defeated Ronan in the first film?
Man, give your dog some bath
Rocket may be die😥😥😥
Rocket and drax also has a high chance of dieing
Groot died 🤯 I always thought he resurrected
oooh I'm probably going to end up crying my eyes out on this one...hope they don't kill any of them off..
From the first release.. instantly became my favorite storyline next to Captain Americas... Thor got demoted... lol
Maybe the squid world is the remains of a dead celestial, and the high evolutionary is harnessing it with the rings.
If Rocket dies I quit
I bet money Disney is going to throw some gayness in this movie and ruin it like they did Thor love and thunder.
I feel like this one is gonna get me.
Maria Bacalova not balova
I think 🤔 drax dies
I hate the dogs voice
I love rabbit
Wouldn’t it be kinda neat if Adam ends up with the solar gem since vision ended up with an infinity gem.
Why on earth did they fire James Gunn?
A channel called Ben's Worx uses the same exit music as you. Kinda weird.
Well we gotta remember that in every third film they always lose something 😢
Guarantee Rocket isn't dying in those scenes in the trailer. It's probably a flashback given the pellets and flooring he seems to be laying on. I'm hoping the whole thing ends in a cliche "[insert character] went off on a round the world expedition and was never head from again" freeze frame ending.
Counter Earth is also where Spider-Man Unlimited takes place!
So I’m guessing PhyLa Vel and moondragon will be in the next GOTG team.
Bruh. What is the space-anus is literal? (Being a Celestial's)
I noticed at the end you referred to Swoll Groot as Groot v1 😂
Damn Doug is dark
Peter will try to get Gramora to remember him and fall in love with him again but she won’t and he’ll have to live with the version of Gramora  he loved being dead for good. It’ll be a said movie
Yea pretty sure that’s not New York nor the Statue of Liberty lol
Wait ! Groot died ?!? That's his son ?! 😭😭😭
I’m extremely hyped for this movie! I’ve always loved the Guardians and it’ll be super emotional and wholesome to see their final adventure
The Beastie Boys have to be the reason for the coloured space suits and the floaty walk.
I really wonder what rocket is building. Maybe it ends up being something that helps them beat the the high evolutionary
8:23 Props for not glossing over the messed up way they sent a dog to just ...die in space.
For some reason the keeps ad doesn’t hit the same coming from him
You didn’t mention them carrying Peter out ‘injured’ in the beginning of the trailer.  I think we are going to lose at least Rocket and Drax, Peter could go too.
Now your making it sad
I just hope no one dies,  and Lylla isn't part of a tragic backstory cause she has been that alot sadly. also Lylla is his girlfriend not mom or sister
I'm hoping Adam warlock is a partial clone of quill and the gem is a piece of Ego, giving him the matter powers Ego has.
"Surrogate sister or mother" Your idea of what a soulmate is weirds me out
Is it just me or did that guy who yells at Drax seem like a James Gunn cameo? Lol. It kinda sounded like him.
Interesting how everyone's assuming Lylla's still alive in the present.
Oh lawd 7:17🤣🤣
1:38 The new ship is called Bowie, according to the Christmas special.
I'm sorry as much as I enjoy your breakdowns,  that dog sounds is irritating. I hate skipping but I've to so I'm going to stop following you. SORRY
DOUG IS THAT DUDE
Does... does Doug have rabies?
Also I believe those colored space suits are paying homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey
Will we see Moondragon?
Man I want them to at least make it to secret wars! Damn it
I’m beginning to hate the term Easter egg,  give it back to its original term
RIP James gunn
I don't know why your calling their uniforms "Red and blue"  when the uniforms are BLUE *with* red *trim*,  you only say "red and blue" if the colors are red dominant with only a little bit of blue, which they aren't.   That thing your disgustingly calling a "space anus" is probably an organ of a dead Celestial that was made a part of the High Evolutionary's Biological Research Lab, it's probably a satellite, and at it's center may be a portal to Half World/Counter-Earth where all the AniMen live...
Is no one gonna mention that the dog is still in space!!!???
they are killing rocket!!!!
It still cracks me up humans first thought was to send a dog into space.. lol
Too bad Batista is getting a bit long on the tooth & likely won't make any more movies after this one. I for one would've loved to have seen a movie w/Drax, Rocket & Groot. In fact, if there are GotG characters who could use their own adventure series of films, it's Rocket & Groot.
"Giant anus portal" had me DYING lmao!!!
Just g9tt a say please do not make fun of me or get mad but Star Lord is my NUMBER 1 MOST FAVORITE character in Marvel and the 1st Guardians movie is still to this day at my favorite mcu movie special presentation short series one shot anything and Chris Pratt is my most favorite actor so I am gonna be so sad to see them go if they do Disney screwed up and if star lord dies I am probably not gonna watch marvel again or T least it will, super also u r my fav youtuber thx for making these videos
At the 15:20 is that Yoda holding a sign between nebula and mantis?
Doug is scary
Don't eff with Doug
I want a shirt of Doug with the quote "I'd kill him in front of his family too" 😍😍😍😍 then on the back have a picture of Ryan with a quote of "......dark......"
I have to know, why is the lighting for the sponsored content always so harsh and different from the rest of the video?
Phyla-Vell is the girl running in front of the Higher Evolutionarily in the mouse wheel she'll take Draks role
Ryan, do you think the High Evolutionary is ever going to come looking for Doug back?
Gamorah is extra foxy in this movie for some reason
It kinda looks like that wasn't Rocket. It was otter we see later
It looks like rocket might have a couple family members with him in that cage when that hands reaching in for him in the foreground there's a couple other fuzzies
8:40 definitely was me in school 😂
Colored spacesuits they're wearing are similar to the colours of the infinity stones.
Seems typical that when they hint/make us expect one major character will die, there will be more than one.
The thing in Adam warlock’s head looks a lot like the metal we see in rockets back from his time as an experiment of the high evolutionary…
It's crazy that this is coming out almost 10 years after the first movie! I didn't even realize the second movie came out six years ago. I remember it like it was yesterday. Still the movie I've seen the most times in theaters.
The point about the Zune and Peter growing up has validity with this trailer. Guardians 1-2 featured exclusively 70s-80s music, but the song in this trailer (In the Meantime by Spacehog) is not only from 1995 but is very of that era stylistically.
Thanks Doug
I come here for the videos but I stay for the dog
SPOILERS - you didn't mention that!
Dave Bautista was putting on weight for a movie role so hence his chubbier face.
Not a single line for Nebula´s new arm?
RIP Leika :,(
You don't see the skyline because you're looking at New Jersey.
I am not ashamed to admit, if Rocket dies, I will be sobbing uncontrollably and the theater ushers will likely ask me to leave.
And Rocket is also the most likely to die because he’s the most painstaking to animate and Disney has been getting lazy about their CGI
"Sure it did." Dark, Dude. Dark...
You really just opened my eyes to Adam warlock, forreal! Thanks!
How do you think marvel plans their movies and content? How long do you think Kevin will stay in charge in marvel, because I am wondering about how far he has planned ahead. I don’t think he is someone that just leaves.
Wrote this comment under the official trailer BUT IF ROCKET RACOON D1ES, I WILL SMASH SOMETHING AND SOMEONE
Oh no… no no no.. rocket’s gonna…oh no.. 😢
Wait so are you frfr that’s Groots son??😮‍💨
No way that’s Groots kid,,,,,,,?
I hope John C. Reilly is in this movie!
Why they keep making this character different races 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
James Gunn gonna light some fireworks at DC
Right before Guardians 2 came out I got my newborn kitten a raccoon toy and called it rocket. He is a tabby cat and I always said his tail and coat looks like a raccoon so that’s why I got him that toy. To this day my cat still has the same raccoon toy and he brings it with him all over the house. I always ask him “where’s you friend Rocket Raccoon at today?” Rocket Raccoon has been a part of my family for years now please let come out this movie alive!!!!😢
Based on the position of the STatue of Liberty, the shot of NYC looks to actually be the New Jersey side. i.e. looking _from_ NYC toward NJ
Express VPN is far safer, don't use NORD just like you shouldn't use or trust McAfee.
Correction: Their outfits aren't just a nod to Rocket's look in the comics. It's a nod to their whole team's outfits in the comics when they became popular during the DnA run (around late 2000s). They all wore these exact red and blue outfits.  Read your comics instead of scrolling wikis.
I am going to ugly cry so badly when rocket dies, lord help me
What happened to the benatar
I cannot recommend the Guardians of the Galaxy cartoon enough. It's fun, but they did a pretty big dive into Rocket's origins.   Also, what if that's a Celestial's anus? 😂
Maria Bakalova. Not Belova. She's not Yelena's sister.
Calling that Rocket will either sacrifice himself or retire with his otter girlfriend.
Once Quill is fully matured he'll be listening to an iPod nano.
I think the High Evolutionary is using  the Celestial anus from the same celestial from nowhere. 🤔
This movie looks like it’s going to be the best yet! JG is such a talented director and he loves this franchise which is clear when u see the detail in this movie not just with the story but the visual effects quality of this movie will be amazing to put lightly. I love the choice of song for the trailer.
Why Gamora didn’t make any kind of nexus event???
I hope the entire trailer was a big red herring and the real plot is Rocket and the Otter getting married.  The trip to Counter Earth is to invite everyone to the wedding.    GOTG are in the wedding party.  The High Evolutionary will be the officiant of the wedding.  Everyone lives happily ever after.
Why is the high evolutionary a black guy? Why can't we cgi the real high evolutionary in?, and if it was a white guy in the comics, why??? Why marvel whyyyy
Is this the same high evolutionary as the one from Spider-Man Unlimited ??
"Lyl and her man, who called himself Dan, were in the next room at the ho down."  "He said "Rocky you met your match," Rocky said "Doc it's only a scratch...and I'll be better as soon as I am able."
What happen with Adam? Oh never mind. Lol.
Disney are literally destroying marvel, as a life long fan I’ll probably never watch a marvel movie again thanks to Disney 😥
I really think this is gonna be drax's last movie. My prediction is, he will find out his daughter survived, and sacrifice himself to save someone.
What a cute dog!
Dude the Guardians AS A TEAM and Starlord in particular were wearing those Uniforms since ANNIHILATION: CONQUEST if not before. The Guardians regular series(2010) actually featured most of the movie line up IN THOSE UNIFORMS.
Dang Doug went full gangsta on that wifi 💩
I know rocket will died 😕😮‍💨
Giant anus portal is wild
Ah yes… typical Marvel to spoil the look and excitement of Adam Warlock.   Sure, of course we knew he would be in it, but it would’ve been so much more exciting to see his appearance IN the movie.   Shit like this ruins the mystery.
So...... nobody is going to mention the space costumes are the *same* colors as the Infinity stones? 🤔
For the first time since Spider-Man, no way home, I’m excited for a marvel film.
The colored space suits reminded me of Capt Charlie 27 from the Guradian's first appearance in MSH Presents
How do you do this so fast
Hope people read their copies of The Island of Doctor Moreau before this comes out because it's looking to be a better adaptation of the book than any of its actual film adaptations. Let's! Get! Literary!
Pretty sure it's pronounced mage-us
Doug is a savage. YEAH DOUG!!
*_Baby Rocket - Cutese 😍_*
Seeing Adam Warlock ,finally in love action ,I’m so excited I think William Poulter is gonna kill it wit this role
Damn Doug… kill him in front of his family? Bad dog… a little
Bro make a video on Transformers rise of the beasts
Does Adam warlock have any encounters wit kang?
poor doug he thinks she actually survived and returned to earth
I still think some of them will show up in Secret Wars so no deaths
7:10 AMONG US!!
She’s a new Ravager Leader btw
Death list I think will be  1. Rocket 2. Drax 3. Nebula  4.kraglin  Maybe Star lord but I think he has a bit more story left with the rest of the guardians
Oh this movie is gonna f—k me up. I’ll be there. RIP Rocket. 😢
Not a single thing said sells the idea that Adam Warlock is great lmao
That anus portal though 😂
The Guardians franchise is one of my favorites in the mcu. It's gonna be bittersweet to see the movie...
I think mantis is gonna die ....
I would pay actual money to watch Doug kill that friggin' sock.
Phase 4...didn't happen. we've gone to plaid and skipped straight Phase 5 - Thank you Uncle Thanos!
Sure it did 😂
7:11 SUS
I am also going to enjoy adam warlock subplot , though I kept wondering when relooking him up will we see him serve as hero or guardian of counter earth. I also hope we see a version of infinity watch.  while star fox and pip are busy it would be cool if that's new guardians of galaxy team Gunn hinted at as he said this is the end of this version. we have Sylvesters team who are known as the ravages as both him and yondu were space heroes in the 60s specifically 1969 the year we began space travel.
Does look trapped in the 80s, except you see a few solar panels on a roof.
The universal church of truth would be such a good story line.
10:10
....I feel like Rocket is gonna die in this movie :(
Thier space suits kinda match the colors of the Infinity Stones...
“Pete. I'm done running” - Rocket   This right here. This glorious moment is when Rocket’s character arc comes full circle. He's been running away from his past for too long. He's now ready to confront it. Even if it costs him his life. It's all for saving his family. I also love that Rocket is calling Star-Lord “Pete” instead of “Quill” because it gives me a feeling that at that point, Rocket trusts him enough that he is willing to die with him to save the galaxy. Because after all, the galaxy needs it's Guardians.   🚀💫❤️🔥
This made me laugh out loud when I saw the thumbnail because I was really excited to watch the breakdown and I hadn’t expected to see it yet. Nice
Isn't Cosmo a he not a she
I love how they introduced counter earth in this film. I first heard of it on the infamous spiderman  cartoon. what's weird is rocket hailed from halfworld originally  used as failed mental asylum where rocket and several other ulifted animals  who were serve as orderlies. until the orderliness. made the aslum abandoned it and left rocket and his halfworlders to their own devices
I really want Rocket to have a solo movie. I’d love to see him team up with a lesser known character n do a buddy-cop film with Groot in the background being Groot.
“Earth Girls Are Easy” reference? Lol
The multi color suits remind me of the beastie boys “alive” video. Twin towers are in that video fwiw
Maybe counter earth will take us on a guided history of all the travesties that have occurred over the course of that societies existence to see if they match up with ours 🙄. So bizarre to mention pre 9/11 World Trade Center as something that’s being hidden for a possible reveal.
The High Evolutionary is using that weird machine to turn many planets into his humanimal
Where did High Evolutionary get baby Wanda and Pete from?
What was up with those Among Us space suits, though?
i want Adam Warlock with a long hair like Sephiroth..!!
Yeah, I think we're going to see the death of Rocket in this one. It's going to be tough.
Wait. So how is that planet still a planet? Lol
2:08 if the Twin Towers are on Counter-Earth, I'll appreciate this movie that much more
Spacehog: no one remembers our hit song James Gunn: I can help with that
Ryan I hope you do a transformers trailer breakdown video too 🙏
Nebula has gotten thicc!
We haven't seen a  Guardians of Galaxy since 2017 also because of Thanos snapping most of them away for 5 years
She should be with the TVA
The dog wants to kill the hacker that stole his data in front of his family 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
7:20 I'm not sure about that, why would they all disembark from the ship to spacewalk towards it, then go back & enter it in the ship? I guess they could be checking it out, but surely they could do that in a safer way by just staying in the ship.
Divine is mine!
I am now going to have a Space Anus in my head for a while so thanks for that.
Wonder if Nebula and Rocket got close during the blip
Back to back Monty Python references. Nice.
The guy in white that Peter saves by jumping off a building could be The Broker. He wore a white suit, right?
If rocket dies, I'm gonna be so angry...
Great write up. I just hope that Quill and Gamora get back together and she doesn't die, AGAIN.
Adam Warlock was teased at the end of the second GOTG movie, not the first one.
crazy seeing Gunn swtich sides and join DC
It almost looks like there's an otter skull on Adam's chest piece, like a trophy, and I hope it isn't Rocket's girlfriend's
Correction: the Statue of Liberty is in Jersey City not Manhattan
why do I have a feeling we'll see Nova and Starfox in the post credits and mid credits scene
This trailer forecasted the death of Rocket so much. Too much. If he ends up dying, I’m going to be pissed it was spoiled.
How many of you people think that marvel will recast the core avengers and X-Men and  soft reboot the MCU as a whole after secret wars?
That isn’t the Statue of Liberty. That’s your mom.
Bruh the “sure he did” to Doug sent me.  💀💀💀
I think rocket is gonna die :,(
Hopefully, this movie right the ship for Marvel.  Suck that Gunn is leaving as I'd rather he take over from Feige.
Your response to the scam titles controversy is super disappointing my dude.
If rocket passes im going to freak out straight up balling in the theater. Rocket's a G...
Are we just going to ignore the scene of everyone dressed like five of the six Infinity Stones?
"Sure he did" poor doggo
The new ship's name is Bowie (named after late David Bowie). It made its debut in the special presentation.
I swear to God if they kill Rocket!!!!!
It would be sad if they kill off Mantis. Especially after the revelation in the holiday special. That would be a big gut punch for certain person/persons
I wish you wouldn't post spoilers from trailors.
Great video.
ScreenCrush, 13:54. Second movie.
If this gardians movie makes 900 million to a billion we will get another one.
The Milano: Alyssa Milano The Benetar: Pat Benetar New ship: The Bowie: David Bowie Peter loves his '80s Pop culture!
dog is a paid actor.
I was gonna say, Nowhere's body gotta be out there somewhere. In pieces it looks like.
10:38 funny stutter
Are you sure that's Peter or is that a "put to sleep" Kevin Bacon from when Kevin Bacon ran off in the Xmas special?
THANKS for this! Adam was introduced in Vol. 2, by the way.
Holy shit Doug
when peter said they were gone for awhile it could also be referencing thanos snap
Kraglin is not in a lot of the trailer. I think he is going to die early on in the movie.
Maybe White Vision? Not Xandar?
THE BOWIE!!!
I’m gonna miss James Gunn so much 😢 Disney didn’t appreciate his hard work
Hamster wheel is straight out of 2001 A space Odessy.
The new ship is called THE BOWIE I think. Pretty sure it was mentioned in the Holiday Special.
Sylvester Stallone was listed in the credits. So the next version will likely have him, Adam Warlock, Cosmos and maybe a few of the original guardians like Groot, Mantis and Nebula
Hearing groot saying we are groot again gives me PTSD
The trailer just came out, how do you have all this information already?
Ant-Man and GOTG3 are giving a promising start to Phase 5… hopefully it’s even better than Phase 4
Spiderman Unlimited cameo?
There was a Bova reference in WandaVision.
Thanks for another great video as always Ryan ,and doug your details ,and analysis are always top notch 👌🏾
The woman walking around in a circle reminded me of that shot in 2001
i think someone gonna die 😢
Super hype for this. So many things I really wanna see. High Evolutionary, Adam Warlock, and Rockets love intrest from the comics. Forget the name.
Shows what you know I came up with 78 easter eggs.
My heart will break if Rocket dies. The Guardians are my favorite franchise in the MCU.
Im happy to see rocket backstory but, I'm going to be devastated if he died💔.
I really hope this movie is good. Marvel has blown for a while now it feels like.
Already crying from the trailer… imagine actually watching the movie, GOING TO CRY MY EYES OUT :(
If rocket dies I’m sending marvel the therapy bill
The High Evolutionary's creations are called the New Men (although one small group of the New Men were called Animen not to be confused with the Ani-Men that debuted in Daredevil).
I foresee a sad/funny moment when Rocket comes face-to-face with the fact he IS a raccoon
Can't wait to see Adam warlock in action.
did you just reuse the joke about cosmo? I think so, yes.😁
The guardians have always been the group with the most heart in the MCU to me. I love a group of misfits...I just know it's going to be a tear- jerker.
I'm not ready for rockets story 😭
Sweet I was not expecting this!!
Cmon Ryan stop defending established titles it’s very obvious it’s a scam
Guardians of the Galaxy is going to be an emotional roller coaster. I’m really excited to learn about Rocket’s backstory as well
Phrase 5 already going to be very serious and a emotional roller coaster
Need Trailer Easter Eggs for Indiana Jones 5 & Transformers Rise of Beasts
Rip rocket 😢😢
Gamora is always successful. So the high evolutionary is studying her
Song choice always reveals so much. Bravo James Gunn, sucks ass he going to DC
Hey why is Ned interested in my personal data 😂
SPACEHOG!
Screen crush made me like marvel.
lol perfect timing '
Phase 4 of the MCU has been pretty meh but this trailer… man, it’s so epic and emotional.
I been waiting for your video 💯🔥
