that unnecessary chunk Filly did to Charlie looks on purpose, just because u pay them it doesn't mean u can do anything to their hair. Honestly this is one of the reasons i hate Filly

So many comments about how people feel bad for Charlie because he looked scared/nervous or upset, I could be wrong but im pretty sure Chalie has asberges or mild autism, you can tell towards then end he was opening up, he came out, went on a show with some big personalities, that takes BALLS, bigger balls than I got, respect Charlie, your the man and 200 squid for you troubles niioce
Filly and Sharky always messes folks hair up Nella can do the same 🤣🤣
filly you done him dirty bro
Charlie literally started crying, i was nearly crying it was so sad
Wait people really laughing at Charlie though. Man UK moves crazy 😢

I’m sorry Charlie, about your experience here. Hope you’re doing okay
What's KDB doing here
I felt so awful for the guy Nella had. I know he signed up for it but it just felt like he was almost being bullied and I honestly think they need to choose better on who they pick for something like this. Not a good look at all!

Scary is really cute no lie
Charlie's trim looked calm until filly took off a whole chunk off the poor guys head😭
haaa charlie was probably cried after the camera man said thanks man.
I felt so bad for charlie, bro was holding back his tears ever since he sat in that chair 😭 but I mean at the end of the day what did he expect? he probably got scouted from the streets or sum and his hair already looked good so there was no need for him to get a haircut
I honestly feel soo bad for Charlie😕

Filly why you violating a person like that, so what if a man has Dandruff.. instead of Maybe advising a person a Dandruff Shampoo, you are trying so hard to show everyone that he has a Dandruff. I like you, but this is an L.
Again, do people even know ANYTHING about what will happen before coming on this show?

Nellas laughter made it 10000% more painful yet funny 🤣🤣🤣
@Yung Filly actually made that Charlie guy cry, i think Filly will apologies....maybe even call him to link up Charlie could legit be going through some emotional stuff
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣I'm crying, Filly is evil for that😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Filly so why ain't you done a rap battle?
Charlie looked like he wanted to cry wagwaan😭🤣
Listennn there’s NO AMOUNT OF MONEY  YOU CAN GIVE TO A BLACK GIRL TO MASH UP THEIR HAIR!🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️😂
Charlie seems depressed personally don’t think he should have participated. At the end it seemed that he was going to cry felt bad for him.
I really feel bad for Charlie, I hope the money was good enough to cosole him
get chunkz in not sharky
I'd love to see more of Charles, he was hilarious
sharky listening to odd future and the members in OF makes him even more attractive
Why is this feeling like reparations
Charlie holding tears brudda. The cat wasnt even that bad until the chunk😭😭😭
Filly gave the worst trim of all 3 😂😂😂I was going to say Sharkey but Charles kept laughing the entire time so he was feeling it and Nella because she's so sweet her customer didn't care as much. Buy Filly !!!😂😂😂🤣🤣I'm rolling . The boy was in tears Filly 🤣
Honestly if I ever came on this show I would wear a wig so at least I'm safe
Charlie had tears in his eyes😭
Philly had the worse ge made the boy cry 😕😂😂
Life after the cut….should be a new show 🤣🤣🤣
Poor Charlie was depressed right after and cried
Charlie reminds me of JJ so much 😭
Funny how they only ruin the White peoples hair and not the black guys... Beard🧔🏽 GAY PHILLY👶🏾 PEPA GAL 🐖
When are these lot getting a proper job?
Reading this comments is killing me of how the way people are spelling Charly's name wrong. I'm legit friends with him and I know it proper upset him and it would really annoy him the way everyone's spelt his name 🤣🤣
Charles is so handsome
You should do a episode of bring some of the people with the worse haircuts on the show and reveal how their hair got fixed up
NELLA PERSON HAD THE WORST TRIM
Nah filly did Charlie wrong
I see Nella Rose, I click. Simple.
Why did he sign up for the show? Charlie confused me, bless him.
Very time I see the thumbnail I no it is a banger am I right✌
Not Charlie crying at the end😭😭😂😂💔💔
Charli was deadass gonna cry at the end 😭😭
"Charlie you kinda remind me of Charli and the Chocolate factory"  C: I do?  "yeah you look like a fucking oompa loompa"
I know Charlie from work 😂😂😂 he couldn’t even look me in my eyes at work I don’t know how he’s doing thisb
FootAsylum you won’t fligh me out to London to cut Philly’s waves you wontnntntntntn. U probably wont even respond to this comment
Philly is the worst but sharky is a very close second
„What was your response? Did you bark?“ hahahah 😂😂

I don't like this series.
NOT CHARLIE CRYING AWWW ITLL GROW BACK WEAR A BEANIE
“ hideous, horrendous “ 😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂
Poor Charlie. Probably regret all his thoughts to come on the show. Bless him trying to hold on his tears.
What was your response, did you bark? I am DONE with Filly 🫠😩😭😭😭😭
Nella defo had the werst trim but she also had the hardest guy out of all of dem
Nah Filly wrong to ask Charlie to spit lyrics after that shave 😭 He was crying inside, outside and all around and he still complimented Filly ✊
I knew Filly was gonna say Rock gyal @18:42 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I feel bad for charlie man he almost cried  why did you do my mans like that phily you foul 😂
Sharky putting down the trimmer and really getting into the meowing story is something else😂😂
10:54 Nella killing the camera with her moves lol
11:58 "An attempt was made" lol I can't--
Nah of course filly loves conceited.... The irony 🤣
The last guy is like joker 😭😭😭if you have watched the movie u know 😭😭
We need does the shoe fit again pls🔥
Nah this one had me cryin real tears
Filly made man cry 🤣
I get my trim done every week and always look sick no problems what so ever so I left it for about 3 weeks and it got quite long so I was gassed to get a trim and get patterned...anyway I goes to the barber and see a new worker so I was a little bit sceptical at first and thought fuck it what can possibly go wrong...sit in the chair told man what I wanted and he done the complete opposite and didn't listen to me what so ever! so now I look like an ice gem and have to wear my hood for 2 weeks until I go back...moral of the story don't go to the new worker in any barbershop!!!
Filly you horrible person😭😭🤣🤣Nella told you that Charlie has tears and at the end he was sniffling 😔😔poor Charlie😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nella is the GOAT!!!!!!

Sharky's was the worst only cos he violated from the start
Charlie's haircut should be called the thinaroonies
Filly should go according to the style  Follow the rule!!!!
LMAOOOOOO not Filly talking about rock gyal 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The “Rock gyal” is undefeated😂😂
I don't think Charlie is okay.
Charles is the dude that did the spiderman meme bruvvv small world
bro charlie knew what he was getting himself into, you cant start crying bigman
Another week of telling y'all that @Sharky can gerrrit...🤩
When will there be a new season of does the shoe fit?
Filly did him(Charlie) dirty 😭
when filly started yelling at me, i ran to the comments. liked & subscribed king

LUCA DO AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I did not expect charlie to actually be crying
I love Nella rose 🌹. I wanna live in London 😭
Lmaoo it’s like I want to feel bad for them but they signed up for it😭

Charlie was on the verge of tears 😭
Oy nah charlie shouldn't have come, he set himself up fr😭😭😩🤚🏼
I wanna see them do someones trim good brav
Nella ruined the guy’s whole career with that haircut 😭😭
Charlie got the least noticeable one if he spray black on the back it won’t be easy to notice plus a month to grow is good
When Filly took off the bowl and put it back 💀💀💀💀
I don't know about you lot but I kinda liked it watching charlie cry😂
Why do people sign up for this knowing it's gonna be bad and still be upset 😂💀😂💀😂 n they get paid
Charlie should’ve stayed at home
Charlie was crying fam😂😂😂
I bloody love filly LOOOOOOOL
12:19 bro cried😭
😭😭😭😭😂 filly you mess up big time sir 😭😭😭😭
i get the feeling they dont really tell the people what theyre signing up for like why else would you cry, if you knew they could potentially fuck up your hair they always seem like they feel betrayed
"How does it look?" "Charlieee...I think you're a great guy" loooooooool
No Charlie, he had tears at the reveal 🥺
At 4:45 Nella knew she fvcked up LOL
Brah Big man Filly I hope you apologize fr fr
Filly got no brain at all wtf
My guy Charlie is going through it brooo
NELLLLLAAAA looked in his face and couldn’t help but laugh 😭 I’m sorry I dying at that point too 😂 God forgive me man 🤣🤣🤣 as for Charlie, pele. Stressful settings 😅 lastly the drenching of water wow 😯 loool 👏🏾

Charles personality it the best!!! He laughed all the way.
I wonder if they will eventually become good barbers from all these episodes😂
Charlie was not built for this, bless him 😅
Filly really doesn’t feel the rock gyals 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nella is just annoying
Sharky is so fine (I’m a guy)
First guy looked like that don in toy story 2 who fixes woodys arm after Bella was finished with him🤣🤣
Charlie here. Update: the hair is still shit. A lot of people are saying I look scared, and I was. But I was scared because I'm a little bitch boy when it comes to talking to people. This was about a month ago and I still miss my hair. Sad face.  Also, I know I was really fucking boring for the rap bit, but my mind did legitimately go blank ☹️
I love how Charles laughs so much 💀😭
Charlie finna cry tonight!😭😭
Charlie count yourself lucky lad, at least u left with most ur hair on ya head lol
nah this dont sit right with me or maybe I'm being too emotional but still😢😢
The cut wasn’t even that bad for Charlie until that chunk 😭
Emotional damage…
Omg omg Charlie wanted tooo cry it was tooo painful man !!
Shame I adore them but I'd never do this shem. I value my hair. And Filly should've just left that hair after taking off the bowl. It was fine😂😂😂😭🙌💔
“It’s absolutely ridiculous - horrendous” 😭😭😭
Charles is the goat LOOL 20:26
Charlie, must have been the worse cut poor boy waa crying afterwards.... bad form  🤣🤣🤣🤣
