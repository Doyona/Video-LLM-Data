Love how he wanted tobi and manny and in the first pre recorded clip he's wearing Illvzn incase they did 🤣
Your two ways are one of the ugliest trainers ever seen made tbh
Max and Zac deserve more love in the scene. They make incredible content. Good shit as always Cal!
Maybe if you change the title a few more times you’ll actually get some views
Clickbait vid
It's small
Why is Raid Shadow Legends catching shots 😂
He says the shoe is made from the same material as the Nike Jordan 1 Dior shoes and that they are durable and comfortable but then proceeds to put them on without untying them

ayyy
Yeah give it to Prince Charles, he loves suitcases full of cash.
Wake up   Jesus is coming back a lot of people have been ignoring the warnings since 2020 and the only person you’re hurting by doing that is yourself and you’re family   God is doing so much and has done so much for you to wake up and understand the times and season you’re living in so you can repent and be saved   it’s like the days of noah. God sending his servants in love because God loves you to warn you before judgment comes and yes of course human nature   Human beings ignoring God just like the days Noah mockers and scoffers laughing at the preaching of the word  scoffing at the preachers and persecuting those that come in love and share in love   scoffing at the word of God and all this scoffing and mocking even after all that you’ve seen since 2020 and have experienced  Yet everyday life continuing people oblivious to the coming judgement upon this world like the days of noah and ignoring everything that they’ve seen and are seeing   ignoring the fact that there’s a war happening in Ukraine which could potentially lead to nuclear war also ignoring the fact that Israel is about to go to war with Iran and China is about to go to war with Twain   Ignoring the fact that food prices are rising aswell as fuel prices there’s talks of worldwide famines by 2023 new diseases monkeypox after we just had a virus cause havoc on this world for two years and now we have a new one   yet people are choosing to ignore all this signs when the bible told you that this would happen in the last days  A time prophesied by Jesus - a time worser then anything that’s happened  in this world yet you can still be saved out of that time and out of the tribulation and it’s only through Jesus that you can be saved from the wrath to come and from hell and from eternal Separation from God because of you’re sins for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus   you’re in the middle of a spiritual warfare light - against -darkness and you have no idea how great or wicked that darkness is nor what that darkness is doing or planning for you   the Lord Jesus Christ is coming back to judge this world and to put everything right  God’s will is for all to be saved and for none to perish but time is running out this is not the time to be running away from God but rather to God and for my brothers and sisters in Christ   my fellow Christians don’t play church you’re either with Christ or you’re not beloved. Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.  you’re either in the light or in the darkness you’re either on Gods side or Satan’s side beloved Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.  Beloved You have to pick up you’re cross and follow Jesus and deny yourself daily and crucify your flesh daily and be holy because God is holy offer you’re body as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing unto God beloved strive i repeat strive ! to enter through the narrow gate for many will try but will not be able too   This message is shared out of love to everyone so you can be saved   So Repent and give you’re life to Jesus accept him as you’re Lord and saviour and receive forgiveness and salvation through Christ Jesus    Acts 4.12  And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved   John 14:6 6 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me  God bless
Great video
The green suits and the editing around their heads made the whole video
Nice
Lame idea for a video, man's trying to flex he's got money by giving it away 🤦🏽‍♂️🤡
Callum, I’m no youtube genius but if you see this you gotta work on your title game, although having just finished the vid it was a banger
Raid just got a free shoutout
So i watched this thinking you was giving money away.didnt think big youubers make click bait videos.
Great format mate really enjoyed the video
Pickachu? Nah, Nonce.
It would be great if you could reduce the background noise
Money is an issue that everyone has for a better and luxurious life was hard for me until I started trading Bitcoin and am now earning $ 18,435 per week
Hi
MAC CHAPMAN!!!!

this is what happens when you put a shoe maker in charge of the green screen :)))
Decent vid but way to much green screen edits.
Clear Max and Zac did shit views being in the thumbnail and title 😂😂

are u shadowbanned?
Possibly get both Danny’s and bowen⚒
Sidemen should do a video with Danny dire
Great video. you've remind me of what someone once said❤️ "The mind is the man, the poor is in it and the rich is it too". This sentence is the secret of most successful investors. I once attended similar and ever since then i been waxing strong financially, and i most tell you the truth.
Max and Zac were superb in this. Good stuff
In before the name change
that clickbait is insane lmao
Changed the title and thumbnail like we wouldn't notice
Cal freezy reuplods and you changing title , videos not performing?
yeah but jordans are much better than no two ways
Was that the Happy Hour theme tune? 4:45
Am I the only one who wants to hear more about the behind the scenes competition with Cal? They keep uploading on the same day, there is definitely a bet going on!
Um new here❤️❤️❤️😭 can I have $83
This thumbnail is killing the view rate
Callux is the better cal also quality  vid
2 of my favourite youtubers... and callux
Good to see Camel-toe and Moose-knuckle making a big appearance in this episode
Raid getting the sponsor for free man
Only ogs know he changed the title from me and max fosh give out free money to people
Why did you take Max and Zac out of the thumbnail and title?
Title changeeee
this editing is crazy
This is one of the most hilarious videos because of the green screens The Logan Paul green screen was the best 😂keep it up Callux you’re the best in the YouTube game rn
You looked at the bottom card of the part of deck you put ontop of their card so when you flip them over their card is the one after the one you looked at? Seems pretty simple to me. The final shuffle makes it fail sometimes but mostly works I'm guessing?

Anyone notice callux and calfreezy have been putting out videos at the same time or an hour apart for the last couple of vids , I wonder if it’s a bet between them to see who gets the best content / subs/ views . Or if callux is trolling freezy by posting an hour after him and the whole thing is a video idea
Jj and deji on this would be gas😂😂
why u click baiting baldy
Need to bring the suits with the hoods back

loved max and zac in this vid!
I am very excited about the prospect of using cryptocurrency, not just as a money equivalent, but using it as a way to earn something as a result of doing some type of work..
Lux seeing as ur giving money away. U might aswell give me a pair of ntw’s ngl I would prefer them more
Look all i wanna know is, you alright mate ?
I hope the white ntw can become a staple white shoe like the air force but no doubt they'll go in 45 seconds and there will be no chance of getting them resale under $250
i wasnt subbed but now i am👍
The problem with Callux's shoes is that... they are so fricking ugly. I wouldn't mind supporting but god damn those are hideous.
Men who wear white shoes 🤮🤮🤮
Oh yes ding dong love that snack from the Philippines 🤤😍
I find it very satisfying that the Zac and Jay channel hasn’t hit 1 mil subs yet. F them
"what happens in Mami" then a clip of the Joshua trees which is in the Vegas area 🤣 no where near Mami
Outro 💣💥
Did he do the happy hour theme tune
Zac singing JaackMaates happy hour whilst spinning😂
1:43 repping the pajama bottoms and clown shoes jheez...

Unreal trio
Yes
