Usyk has humbled this man.
Happy for him good to see him buying houses in Vegas proper success story kind of person you want to see do well
I believe he will beat Wilder again. Wilder's success comes from throwing bomb punches that have no boxing form.  While I see he has a new trainer. I just dont believe he can learn proper technique that fast.I also think Wilder should have had a few fights before coming back for Fury.
Mistake wilder will ko you this time gypsy queen
Deontay wilder: am strong like bull tyson fury: you sure about that?
ESPN is trash
First he lied about the arbitration case and then he suddenly gets covid 19 before the Wilder fight. He strung a lot of people along! No dignity or integrity.
Once wilder beat fury I want all y’all to keep that same energy please I wanna hear all the excuses
A Very Good Excuse from the fight, Congratulations Wild boar fans, tested positive for steroids and also for COVID LOL
I believe him.
Tyson fury ,the inspiration
No cheating this time.
LOADED GLOVES!
I don't think it can be a worse beating than putting a DENT in a mans SKULL.  By the way, can anyone explain how Fury with hand wraps and gloves on managed to put a DENT in Wilders skull? Its almost impossible he would have to be superhuman. Its clear something was in his glove. Or Fury became HULK over night, because in all! His prior fights, he's never dented a mans skull. It obvious what happened that night. what's surprising is how Wilder lived to see his kids another day.
And you going to smoke all the crack and give up your belt 🤣
I remember this interview I tried chatting up the camera man
I wish Fury would use his money to buy a real suit and quit wearing his momma's table cloths.
Price punched your head in.
Wilder only has a punchers chance. He better pray he gets lucky punch
No cheating in this one  time to face The Beast like a man Hollywood  💣💣💣💣💣💣💣
This time fury will  cheat by punching wilder in the face.😂😂 N fury already started cheating by walking out shirtless n showing his chest  in  press conference.
He says, I've got his MOJO".. lol Every time I hear that phrase I think Austin Powers. Uk is funny, man.
Talk is cheap
The second-hand grandfather coherently surround because hail synchronously behave out a quick icebreaker. itchy, humorous asia
Wilder.... The sun was in my eyes my shoelace was untied a dog ate my homework Fury had horse shoes in his gloves
Las Vegas is his? Fury isn’t even American didn’t we have a war about this? 🤦🏽‍♂️
I know something 🤔 Wilder  didn't say anything 😲 at their press conference .😆
ESPN YOU NEED TO EXPLAIN WHY YOU NEVER MENTIONED FURY GLOVES OR ARBITRATION FOR A WHOLE YEAR AFTER FIGHT.  YOU ARE A NEWS OUTLET.  WHY ARE YOU NOT REPORTING THE NEWS!!!!!!!!
Why dont fury admit he didnt wanna fight the 3rd time.? Hes a puss
Fury’s a Idiot
TRASH!!
I love the way the left pretend that Biden is some cool boss with his aviator sunglasses. He’s an OLD MAN with DEMENTIA, who think’s he’s running for senate but then remembered he’s just Jill’s husband and it’s time for a nap! 😂😂😂
2M - 750k
11-0-0 (10)
Honestly I don't think thats even possible unless he has an illegal barefist brawl
I can only bet on fury winning again
I want Wilder to destroy this clown so we can get the AJ fight true boxing fans care about
What’s the point of this fight, we’ve seen him destroy him twice. Boring re match
Who cares, no one wants this fight
So what’s his going to do this time put a baseball bat in his glove his not looking or acting like a champ wilder is going to hurt him he as to run his mouth he wouldn’t fight AJ if anyone knows boxing that last fight they was something very wrong with his gloves. All the time Tyson as been out on the town drinking well out of shape wilder been putting in hard work with his new trainer
I watched the first fight and tbh that second did seem suspect and his gloves definitely were looking suspect cause every time he hit that man you can tell he hurting em so idk man just think about it he dropped twice and the second he just smashed em. Some might say he got better or did he.
I think Fury's right, especially for the heavyweight division. It was practically dead before he came back. Certain that he is the current of the division.
I love Tyson fury
Fury should come out wearing black face and false braids and pimp limp to the ring
The bronze dosser is going to get an absolute hiding as Tyson said go and work in a strip club you big useless dosser
Is he fighting the Prince?
Fury's perception of style is something else
The kingdom of heaven is at hand.  The kingdom of heaven is likened to a merchant seeking beautiful pearls, who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it.
Make sure you check his gloves
Says he’s the one that makes boxing alive I guess canelo just doesn’t exist
I hope he does especially since these fools stoop as low as bringing race into, hope he destroys that POS
I'll get in the ring for 500k and do a rocky  haha
Oh for the real boxers of old all we get now is clowns like this.
I agree with him that is a fact him and Canelo are the only boxers worth a watch anymore Andy Ruiz had a good last fight but it's hard to be a boxing fan🤦 you have to wait for a fight for years while UFC give the best in the world Vs the best in the world every card
Joshua is cool, calm, collected...  Oh, and incredibly boring, spouting clichés like an apprentice philosopher
No problem admitting, did not learn about TF closely until a few years ago.  So fluid for such an huge man.  And the mouth....
Can’t wait
well yeah....i dont think anybody thought he had a chance the 2nd time round....could argue he won the first match  even though he was still on the way back....it will be bad BAD if they fight again the 2nd fight wasnt even cloe
Who cares, its Tyson v Joshua that people want....He had beaten Wilder 18 rounds out of the last 20....nothing more to see.
All mouth from the great white hope 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤠 you dossier.
This man speaks confidence
Not a single person in the comment section mentioned how iced out that cross is around his neck.
Wilder getting his pay back 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Can't argue with him. The greatest characters in boxing were Brits with exception of the Legend Ali ha ha Eubank...Prince Naseem..and Fury 🤣🇬🇧
Yeah fixed gloves you'll beat anybody
Not a wilder fan but I know exactly he’s about to punish this guy don’t care what anyone has to say on it it’s irrelevant just watch what I say
Remember what happened to rocky when he went all hollywood. I am a fan of Tyson but i am worried he may be a little to complacent in the fight and end up getting caught big time.
I hope no one buys this pointless fight.
He dresses exactly how a rich gypsy would dress xD
i hate this man cant wait till AJ smokes him
Dude got knocked out twice and they gave him the win 😂😂😂
Fury fighting bums con artist
Big Momma!
He's in Wilder's head.  Wilder was clearly in fear of Fury before and during the fight.  You could see it in his eyes.
Yeah, no pillow gloves this time around. Win straight up
Wilder's entourage don't care that he may take a severe beating.  They're just looking for another payday.
Tbh both fights need to happen for heavy-weight boxing for the fans to be interested in it again...
you are a character, all right ... a cartoon character, that is
Fury says boxing would be dead but most dont watch boxing for him lol
nobody wants to see this, wilder got beat twice and is just a scrub with a right hand.. we want to see the unification belt between the two actual best boxers in the world. Im not watching this garbage.
What's gone in here? This doesn't seem like the same Tyson Fury we know and love🤔
There was onions in furys gloves to make wilder cry and lose vision during the fight.
Wilder, I believe, will pound Fury.  If Deontay can bring the jab that he was showing recently.  Big if, but if he can.
You talk too much Mr Man
Shouldn’t have bothered with Wilder, he’s proved he could beat him. Should have fought Anthony Joshua, which the majority of people wanted to see
The rapid element phylogentically spell because driving mostly joke underneath a vacuous roast. typical, flowery chinese
Hope ya dont get sparked out in this fight buddy ... Not a good fight for Fury
Dude you talk too much, why don't you do the Joshua fight ? You that you will get knockout that's why you're circling back to Wilder. Pathetic 😂😂😂😂
Think our man should listen to his dad a bit more, this fight is crazy. Wow just imagine if Wilder wins. Wilder vs Aj? Then Fury will have to take on the loser of that? LOVE IT!!!!!!! But COME ON FURY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You cheated last time
All Wilder needs is 1 punch, just saying…
The king..
I watched the Fury Wilder II fight again recently, and while Fury beat him conclusively it was more competitive than I remembered it, in as much as Fury was certainly in danger of Wilder landing a big shot for much of the fight. While many seem to think the 3rd fight is just a formality and I favor Fury to win, it's really going to come down to the "versions" of the fighters that turn up on the day. If Fury isn't 100% focused and motivated by the fight and Wilder is having a good day, I can see the possibility of Wilder winning. I find it an interesting rematch.
Coming from a true boxing fan for the last 40 years, there's is a famine of real heavyweights in the sport. Deontay Wilder NEVER impressed me, he is not a traditional American fighter, his footwork is sloppy, his defense and punch slipping is nonexistent, his boxing style and rhythm are poor.   What I see in Tyson Fury is a good heavyweight and that's it. Before this page implodes, let’s place him in the era where the heavyweight division was loaded with fighters. Let’s place Fury in the 1980’s era where his mettle and flabby build would truly be tested.   1982, Larry Holmes ya think, think again, Mike Tyson, let’s go back to Holmes! Trevor Berbick, don’t do it, Tim Witherspoon, nope, Evander Holyfield, stay home. Mike Weaver, top puncher in history no way! Okay, Okay we’ll try the 1990’s. Mike Tyson, there’s that name again, Tommy Morrison, don’t do it! Ray Mercer, ask Tommy, Big George Forman, well, Riddick Bowe, Yeah right, Lennox Lewis, no way, Donovan Razor Ruddick, well no walk in the park, Ike Ibeabuchi, ask David Tua.   Okay! Early 2000-09 Lennox Lewis, David Tua, stay away! Klitschko brothers, Evander Holyfield, Chris Byrd, Lamon Brewster, and a young Alexander Povetkin. And, there were more!  So, this era is made to order for Tyson Fury, nobody’s home.
We will see
Braking, The second fight, It was a mistake really why it happened that
Tyson looks like that 40 year old that never stopped showing up to highschool to pick up girls
COWARD TYSON FURY .he doesn't want to face ANTHONY JOSHUA
Beat him worse, or beat him better?
Wilder must of lost his marbles nobody can change there style that much that quickly more fool him
Think fury’s back on the sniff again
Love fury
The Great white hope has been resurected.
Tyson fury will beat up Wilder again, and then AJ. He's the real deal here.
If Fury is so much the peoples champ then he should have handed the belt back and fought Joshua like ALL the people want.
Boxing is a joke. AJ and Fury are a joke. Two British boxers willing to fight in Saudi where they execute their citizens. Two money grabbing greedy b*stards. No amount of money is ever enough for these type of people. AJ has gone down in my estimation.
Your a cheater 😂😂
Why does the guy on the left looks like Stephen A. Smith and Max Kellerman had a child together
Yes tyson that's what I wonna hear smash wilder 3 time's worse
Wilders heading for the Fists of Fury lights out time.
I like Tyson Fury but if he’s not right with God he will be beat in this fight.
This fight With ADIDAS Horse hair Gloves, More knuckle protrusion, Really finish the Dosser.
He put stuff in his gloves?
Anthony. J saved again. Dayonte. W, you will eat punch in the face again.
What will be the next excuses for wilder again ?
You gotta believe Tyson is the only character in boxing at this time , and what a great boxer he is
With the same dodgy gloves he used last time ?
I literally could not care less. Wilder v fury 3 what an utter waste of time imo....this is why boxing is failing....the fans aren't given what they want....
Dosserrrrr
Yes by cheating with your gloves
I can't see the point of this.  If Wilder wins, what does it prove?  It's all tied over 3 fights.  So, they would need yet another fight to settle it.  The man lost over 2 fights.  Ah well.
boxings boring now
yeah if you chewt again
Sadly true. He is the only one keeping this sport alive.
Wilder is going to get revenge 👌
Setting himself up for a fall! He should just fight AJ for no money. Wilder ain’t worth it.
First 2 minutes of the interview .... Tyson : 'yesssss'
Furry know he can bare knuckle box cause that’s basically what he did with wilder.
I believe it
Cut it out...he cheated last time... We saw the glove flopping
24 July 2021                                                            🇬🇧Tyson Fury 🆚 Deontay Wilder🇺🇸 3️⃣ 🥊                                                                                    14 August 2021                                                           🇬🇧Tyson Fury 🆚 Anthony Joshua🇬🇧 🥊
Cant respect these nowadays boxers they fight like once a year when iron mike fought every 2 months foh
Tyson spitting truths
That ⌚ that chain that vest makes him look like 3 different people smh. Dress better next time!!
Talkative
if nganonou touches him he will sleep
Fury is the man
All hail the king 👑 king fury I hope Malik let’s wilder go out on his shield when fury beat the ish out of wilder.
But he ducks AJ
Tyson is gonna beat him silly go tyson viva America 🇺🇸 and Mexico 🇲🇽
Total gobshite!
I feel like wilder has a lot more of a chance this time he can’t go three times without winning  fury hasn’t trained all year where he has no time to get in good shape yes wilder hasn’t fought and has been silent for a year but he looks more fit  fury looks slow from the bagwork I’ve seen but that’s only a punchbag
Check his gloves carefully this time
This is just a payday for Wilder. He will go down off a phantom punch like Sonny Listen did 🤷🏼‍♂️
Wilder was trying to get some step aside money,  but Fury took the opportunity to trick Joshua realizing he is prepared for Fury   a change of opponent will cause trouble to Joshua like what happened with Ruiz first fight..  Fury hopes Joshua don`t have enough time to loose weight for usyk.
Fury will beat wilder again. For the third time.
Wilder is going to walk out in Speedos to keep that weight down in his walk to the ring 🤣
Word is Wilder is going back to learn the basics.  At this point of his career if he doesn't know em....he's done.  The man he's stepping into the ring with learned em all at the start and has just built off of them.  I have a feeling he is going to turn Wilder inside out and wipe the ring with Wilder's career.
Truth! 👌
White privileges
Can't wait for the Lomachenko vs Nakatani fight!
It's actually painful how right Tyson is about the state of heavyweight personalities. Deontay and AJ are real cold fishes. AJ has his promoter doing most of his talking for him. It's tragic. Boxing needs fury around for as long as he can take it. I hope he reigns for many years to come.
3:15 facts
Where was boxing when he was drinking, and so fat tho?
Gotta love him!
Why do all sportsjournalists on Tv like to have a pen in their hand, secured by the thumb as they gesture and put their hand against the camera. All of them do this. ALL!
Now Fury is the DOSSER, running scared of AJ.....
He loses. Too confident
This man has been getting fatter and wilder is actually training now he can box honestly I hope fury shuts up and gets knocked out 1st round
Wilder is going to get beaten worse than a ginger step-child.
Why didn't your MOJO work in the arbitration.  Lie to the world.
love tyson fury but i dont want to see this fight again
Tyson looking like Aladdin - Vanilla Ice edition.
I wilder will win this 3rd fight. reason, hes learned how to box. also it makes sense he had covid before the 2nd fight and that's why he found the costume heavy. ive had covid and it messes up your lung capacity
Wilder will not want his corner to throw in the towel. Wilder might be very badly hurt
Fury gonna whoop Wilder for the third time then smash the amateur Joshua
Great boxer, but let the fans down. Who wants to see Wilder/fury 3? Who signs a 3 fight deal and does nt cancel it in December when the had the chance? The entire team knew what they were doing and for what? Fury just lost an estimated £50 million. But yeah, everyone else is a dosser.
Ya want a white hope champion so bad you guys will settle for a cheater cants say that I’m surprised. Beat you on the ground you guys will hop in planes lol can’t win when it’s a even playing field
chissora is a character as wel mush
Tyson fury cheated that last fight  his hands were not all the way in his gloves . Deontay wilder is going to hurt him this next fight ... watch
I really don’t understand why anyone even wants to see this for a THIRD time 😴
I can't get over how stupid boxing is when it comes to putting the big fights on at the right time. Robbed of AJ Fury for another year.
Yes
He's not wrong about the heavyweights being stagnant other than him
Fury speaking FAX
Tyson fury will win its gods Will
Wilder is finally about to get that body on his record, his own
Hes a great boxer fury is but i believe he was dodging wilder one he got knocked down in the first match he vowed not to get hit with the left again he may have cheated so this will be the tie maker
All the Wilder haters are so happy about this
MR. FURY is really scared to get back in the RING with the TRUE CHAMP of the Heavy Weights. MR. FURY knows he wont be saved by a delayed count so he can get up. Real CHAMPS and MEN will honor their contract without getting the courts involved to make them follow through. MR. FURY been running trying to find a way out of this Triology. Putting claims out about how MR. WILDER asking for step aside money insinuating MR. WILDER was scared. If you really WHIPPED MR. WILDER with no problem then stop running stop the lying and face him again since you whipped him so easily. MR. FURY'S own father is scared for his son's life. Trying to paint the narrative of why MR. FURY should not take the fight, telling MR. FURY to drop the belt to avoid fighting The TRUE CHAMP. someone MR. FURY calimed he whipped so bad and easy. Real fans know why MR. FURY has been running. MR. FURY and OLD MEDIA have been EXPOSED. The REAL BOXING FANS know who is the real HEAVY WEIGHT CHAMP is and DEONTAY THE BRONZE BOOMER WILDER is coming for BLOOD. TEAM FURY AND OLD MEDIA can not use the same ways to help MR. FURY win a fight. THEY are scared like a kids who knows when they get home they have an Whipping waiting on them for cheating on the test. I will bet that you MR. FURY WILL find a way out of fighting the real CHAMP MR. WILDER. YOU ARE SCARED AFRIAD and the Real BOXING FANS WILL NEVER CALL YOU CHAMP.
Yeah Tyson make him never forget and try to never let another match happen with him again. Don't give him the satisfaction. Wilder is living in a reality where he can't lose and can't accept the fact that he did. Beat him and never give him another chance to fight you lol! Not to mention he ruined the fight with AJ.
Anyone who thinks Wilder in Vegas isn’t going to be as dangerous opponent is blind. Very tricky fight for Fury.
Should of gave ya belt up let him have it an had it out with aj
I recon wilder is gonna do a number on him this time
What’s with the smackdown vs raw type logo
Fury is the best
i have the feeling somehow Tyson is getting spoiled now. Think this match with Wilder is gonna be a little harder than before.
This is why he is my favorite boxer!
Seeing is Believing 😑
Everybody should just boycott this fight. I’m definitely not watching it. Ridiculous
Fury beats the pants off of both of these gentlemen. Hands down. Not even a question.
I like tyson fury but them gloves did look suspect in that fight. But regardless he did outmatched wilder in that last fight in every way
What with loaded gloves again cheater.
Wilder Got Something For Him This Time
no ones gonna talk about how fury wears his fist in the wrist of the glove,even with all the proof circulating online,plus fury is a known cheater in the past,this alone shows that the world w live in dont care,this kind of cheating wouldnt dare fly in the mike tyson days
He's so unlikeable lol
Your own dad has said it’s a bad move.
he is running scared of Aj
Big match wilder is ready to revenge and fury is over confidence. May be game change i think....
He'll beat him worse than last time, this time he will have brass knuckles in his gloves.
its my city!.......cant name the stadium he's fighting in
welcome to the year 2030 and we cant wait to kick this year off with the highly anticipated Fury v Wilder 18....Can wilder perform the upset after losing the previous 17? tune in Saturday night to find out
Fury is the best.  He will win again.
Well, he's certainly living the life. Could also be his downfall. Saw an interview with John Fury the other day, very honest interview about Tyson may or may not having too many people in his ear, it was bound to happen at some point.  Fury actually moving to Vegas or?
I’d rather watch FAST N FURIOUS 92
we wanted to see fury vs aj not against the guy he beat up to a pulp darn
Wilder's corner need to stay out of it this time
I wouldn't cut Wilder short. He's actually learning the fundamentals and going back to basics.
Fury probably wnt make it pass 5th round kmsl
Forget wilder😒 give the fans what they want TYSON v AJ💯👍
The whole countries behind you Tyson. Wilders just a big DOSSERRRRRRRR!!!!!!
Has Fury stayed with his new trainer or has he dropped him
i like tyson fury more then i like modern boxing, that's a fact!
Deontay Wins the rematch
WILDER has ZERO SHOT IN THIS FIGHT...FURY IS JUST A MUCH BETTER BOXER....HE TOOK WILDER'S BEST SHOT RIGHT ON THE CHIN AND GOT RIGHT BACK UP....FURY HAS WILDER FIGURED OUT...
Is it just me or did I just realize fury has a lisp ?
I never heard a boxer say his outfit was too heavy and it affected his performance!
Fury will lose this time he has lost his way since winning
Flabby
Only if Fury cheats again will he win.
jake paul is always on the topic
Is this gonna be a 3rd fight with Wilder?
No one cares about this fight
We know that. That’s why everyone wanted AJ instead. Dumb.
I doubt this fight will be worse for Wilder.  Fury fought perfect and I don't think he could do any better.  If he thinks he can, it is more likely he will be open for a big shot and KO loss.  Hopefully Fury doesnt fight stupid.
all the controvesy about gloves least they will be checked properly beforehand this time,bet his punches wont look as powerfull 3rd time around i dont see him winning this time,time will tell.
Got To Love The One And Only Gypsy King, The Undisputed Heavy Weight Champion Of The World!!!
Ducking fury i never thought i would ever say that
Deontay Wilder has Fury's number on this one
His own Father has said this is a massive mistake
Wanna hear him say "you're getting it, you dosser!!" 😂
Fury won Both fights why is there a third?????
No point at all in this fight. We know Fury is the better boxer. Either Fury wins again which changes nothing or Wilder lands a lucky punch and ruins the Fury Joshua match.
What is going on with this man?
That's how people lose, by underestimating their Opponents.
IT LOOKS AS IF FURY IS TOO LIGHT.HE NEEDS TO BE 19 STONES.18 IS TO LIGHT FOR HIM..
Wilder is going win have a bad feeling about this fight should have never happen I wanted to see Tyson vs Joshua
So when do we all find out there is a rematch clause with the 3rd fight??
He should be able to beat deontay with ease
So what, what does it prove . He should be fighting Joshua. The fans never get the fights they want
Doesnt tyson fury cheat?
Cheater!! someone should make sure his fist is in his glove!!!
British fans were robbed. If Wilder wins then fair enough he was justified to push for this but if he gets beat even worse than last time he’s just wasted all of our times
Wilders gonna walk out strapped to a bunch of balloons this time 🎈
What will be his next excuses? He was hit by lightning just before walking in? Tyson hit him with the Infinity Gauntlet? John Fury used his mind powers on him?
FACTS
I’d love to see Wilder fight Joshua.
lol wasn't this the guy that got nearly sent to the shadow realm twice by deontay? I think he should be more worried on that 3rd times the charm bit.
I still got wilder if they rematch
The coherent power immunohistologically admit because can geometrically calculate unlike a wrathful security. hateful, ritzy weed
Joshua is running scared, no one wants to watch Fury beat up Wilder for a 3rd time
Fury is just a beast, and he has a heart of gold. True fighting irish
wilder was a clown show  fake butter bean wanabe
Tyson looks full of gear man hope he doesn't go down hill again. Americans will sook the talent out him and kick him to the kerb.
first knockdown was a slip and after that wilder just seemed out of sorts / dizzy...it was not convincing from fury AT ALL...it'll be a different story this time round.
He's right I ain't watching joshua or wilder videos
The fact we waited for 6 months while he was saying he was gonna fight Joshua when he knew he was legally obligated to fight wilder is exactly why boxing is dying everything is dragged out for years to see 1 fight then they go back to have guys who are like 72 and 0 and no ones heard of them
Pay him the step aside money. I want the other fight.
Oh oh ...I think Mr. Fury is dabbling in the white powder again.
Wilder is going to beat him this time!!!!
He's too garrulous. Let's see how long he can keep that one belt.
Coked off his nut in another interview lol
2:35 cheater fix your gloves next time so it don’t flap!
Puppet
FIGHT ANTHONY JOSHUA
I believe him. Wilder is a dead man walking.
best shape of his life, get em tyson
Used to like Fury but hope Wilder wins and fight Joshua
Pointless fight. Going to be same result as first 2!
Wilder retires after this fight
Wilder fucked up wanting revenge 🤣 fury definitely going to crack some bones
..... and thats just the last six days.  Yes!
HE WILL WIN EASILY
Like that was the end of the interview?  It was good but a bit truncated.
This is not the fight that should be happening.  Once again boxing let's it's fans down again.  Shocking.
He's the King for a reason
All these kids calling fury a liar because he said he will fight Joshua next 😂 well he wants to but the court said he has to fight wilder next because it was in his contract that they both signed plus wilder is crying because no one is talking about him and everyone was talking about Joshua vs fury 😂 someone people are actually so stupid.
AJ is a racist with zero personality, I can’t wait to see him get KO’d
I hate that they didn't bring up how wrong he was about Billy Ho 😂🤣 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Disappointing to see the Joshua fight fall through, I was looking forward to that.
Tyson is going to smash Wilder for a 3rd time. Wilder only fought bums now he's been exposed by a guy who has real talent.  I look forward to watching Wilder getting smashed again. If he shows up for the fight.
Tyson isnt even nice like that.. watching him "box(if that's what you call it), is cringe asf..
The woebegone fireplace conceptually behave because arch accidentally judge near a telling climb. ready, acceptable intestine
Why does Fury always dress like a clown?
The flashy loss literally receive because education structurally note minus a murky cell. shy, romantic air
Wilder is totally delusional he didn’t win the first fight, didn’t win a single round in the second fight. He’s going to get his dirt box kicked again, he’s just not that good as a boxer a chancer one puncher but that’s it. Tyson too big too strong and technically far superior than wilder. Wilder should retire now he’s washed up.
Richard Millie on the wrist Tyson , nice
Is it me or does it seem like Tyson might have been speeding a lil?
😑
So true
I still feel that something was off in that rematch like it should have been close to the 1st match or atleast even a bit close. Fury's power in their rematch seems to absurd compared to their first meeting and now it seems like he is avoiding joshua.
I want to see Fury vs Joshua to see who is the best it's not Deontay Wilder
Kizzy fo da nizzy
He was wearing gloves with no padding he’s a fraud wilder gonna kill him
No one cares. Tyson Fury is king ducker.
Fury dressed like gator the pimp lmao
Justin Bieber‘s Big Brother 🤦🏼‍♂️
Why do almost all top athletes dress like a 15 year old douche??
DOn't warry, maybe there are no more XXL Versace. For all the not-fatass it's all safe.
Who cares. Fight AJ. That’s what fight fans want. Wilder is average and Tyson has beaten him twice. NO ONE wants to see or pay for a third fight. Fight AJ! That’s what we want!Fight AJ!
Never said it would be easy . Just feel it can be done if you come in the ring prepared
I really wanted to see that Joshua fight happen. Not a 3x beat down. Hopefully it will be a go in the future
I believe him 😂😂
Funny druggadict werido.
ou i don't enjoy that he called himself a character.
Cheaters won't  Win this TIME
Why are they fighting again? Fight aj ffs
Fury is in for a big fall, he was focused on AJ now he's of course..the yanks are setting him up for a wilder KO..fury is more confused than scooby doo and it aint gunna help him in the ring..
Why is Wilder coming back for more, he lost both fights & that last fight we saw what happened Wilder got knocked down in the 3rd round &  he never recovered his chicken legs couldn't hold him up & he got beaten badly, then blamed his outfit for being too heavy.
100 % true the rest of the heavyweights ducked each other
Wonder what wilder's excuse gonna be this time....
Tyson looked coked out
He has some class with his trash talking
Didn't realize how starved for characters boxing is until Fury said it. He's right, there's no interesting personalities in boxing anymore. You know you've got a problem when the second most colorful character is a fifty year old coked up Oscar de la Hoya.
What a load of bollocks
i dont think he put stuff in his glove HE TOOK STUFF OUT ..lol
I see the Richard Mille watch and that massive chain. Fury's living life 🤣
Not really a Tyson Fury fan he talks too much and fights too little
Tyson fury should be careful with corruption in America
Me thinks Tyson is back on the white stuff 🤔
Watch this fool gets knocked out vs. Wiler.  Know how hard it is to beat someone 3 times in a row?
Fury is a fraud.
Dude lay off the stuff.
Boooooooomb squuuuaaaaaaaaaad
This next fight should be interesting no matter how it goes
Fury need  lose to stop being so cocky. Aj will humble him
Who cares? I am mad at the muppets who allowed the Fury vs Joshua fight fall through.
Best boxer on planet the way he moves defeats physics of this size of a man
fury: i dont care about the belts *would go on a hunger strike to keep his belt fury: i dont care about the money *fights over 2 cents in AJ negotiations
The problem for Wilder is he’s trying new things, new trainer which will ultimately will lead to his downfall. You can’t teach an old dog new tricks, once you start deviating away from why you do well and try and add more at such a late stage in your career, your doing things that are alien to you, therefore more likely to come unstuck. I see Wilder being more exposed in a 3rd fight.
Maybe next time wear legal gloves with padding inside them.
HEY FURY FRAUD THE HOMELESS STILL WAITING FOR THE 7MIL U PROMISED TO DONATE, ALL FOR CLOUT
They need to pay this man whatever he demands
Wilder gave away the last fight..i got Wilder by KO by the 7th...Fury will be too confident.
He never said he "put stuff in the glove" he said the gloves were fixed, per se.
I wonder what excuses Deontay's cooking up for when he loses a third time (yes, I know officially the first fight was a draw).
Fury outweighs Wilder by over 100 pounds. He shouldn't be allowed to fight as a heavyweight. He should be fighting at super heavyweight. He shouldn't have to cheat, with all of the natural advantages he already has. 2 inches taller and 100 lbs. heavier.
Anyone else think he's a cheat?
Not without loaded gloves!!
Ppl get belts, then takes forever to Fight again ... 1 fight every two years
Nobody wants Fury/Wilder. I mean everyone will watch but we all know Wilder doesn't even have a puncher's chance
this guy is getting awfully overconfident and arrogant. Wilder been very quite. Beware.
Why is he dressed like a human frog tho
Is it just me or is he leaner?
i just googled how old is Tyson Fury and it says 32... i'm 32.... this man looks like he can be my dad
Wilder has no chance.
I’m worried Fury is not taking this seriously. I fear he will come unstuck. I’d hate to see Wilder win.
The Gypsy king is the only real box left
Wilder is broken and am thinking he should have had some tune up fights first before meeting fury
he looks 15 years younger with a cap on
Bore off Fury. Everyone in boxing knows he should be fighting Joshua. Will be another easy win for him in this one , nothing to prove. Yawn
Gotta love Fury ❤ Finish this contract with Deontay & move on with Joshua before your both past your prime👍
Really can’t argue with his point about boxing being dead without him. It is clearly struggling on the entertainment side compared with how MMA has thrived this last year. It’s such a shame how politics ruin and run boxing, really fucks us fans over as well as the fighters
The raspy payment behaviourally play because barge effectively mend unto a sparkling chalk. amuck, responsible sleep
Why is he speaking with a lisp now?
For a second I thought the guy on the left was Stephen A smith
Anybody that believes he won't get dragged.
Agreed
all that lying from fury and hearn knowing full well things was in arbitration smh
He’s not guna say he’s guna lose is he
Man fury seems to be doing better and seems to be in a good place. After fury beats him to death again then wilder really should retire
He's probably right. Fury is a freak
Looks cokes out his mind.. well back on it no question!
If you listen closely you can still hear wilder making excuses
Heavy weight boxing has been dead since Iron Mike Tyson started to get beat. Many years have passed without any entertainment, But then came along the Gypsy King, Total respect for Fury he's without a doubt a very special boxer.
This guy is a cheater and a juicer, cheated against Vladimir smh.
i mean he's stating facts
Ask his dad what he thinks!!!!! Wow !!!!!
Fury a fake , miserable bast in reality but tv whoooo &££££££££££
Fury is getting knocked clean out this time.
Confidence is one thing man and maybe he had to say what he did for publicity's sake but even if your the way better boxer Wilders's knockout power is off the charts. I still got Fury winning but I get scared when a fighter stops taking someone seriously especially when the opponent is one of the best knockout artists in history.
Best heavyweight and definitely best character
all that money and you wear a tunic with no shirt under and a backwards hat you look like a fool
Why is he dressed like an eight-year-old?
He has overcome so many things. Will he really get beat by a big spaghetti ?
with his inspector gadget gloves hagaha what a chump
It certainly aint no Jake Paul, Moneygrab Mayweather, Wilder or Joshue that have me keeping tabs on the boxing world. Its this guy for sure
Fury says " i JUST WANNA FIGHT " !!??   Its been a year and a half Fury whats the hold up ??  Fury is a clown.  2 time Champ with ZERO TITLE DEFENSES !!!   All he does is TALK , theres no way this guy is a Champion. He is a joke that is just playing the sport and the people who love boxing. Fury could have given up the title he never defends and fought AJ FOR HIS TITLES !!!  Problem solved , but we all know Fury didnt want AJ , HE COULD HAVE FOUGHT AJ 6 months ago while Wilder suit was still in court. Fury makes a joke of boxing, worst kind of clown.  His next move will be to hold up the Wilder fight ,WATCH.
I'm bored already
I don't really care. The only heavyweight fight that matters is the unification and it is overdue. It'd be nice if the powers that be would actually let that happen instead of money grubbing with divided titles and defenses against lesser opponents, but I guess that is too much to expect.
Deontay is gonna catch that body he been longing for.. HIS OWN!
He’s not wrong
Deonty quiere que tyso fury lo mate eso es lo que el quiere irse para honduras.
Serial ducker.
Not this time because u cheated
Yeeeesssssssss
You let a fat man beat ya
I hope Tyson comes out wearing some blatant tampered gloves 🤣 I know his gloves last time were tampered and one loosened. But doing it blatant would be joke
Guy is one of the best heavy weight boxers ever. I think he is around 5th best ever. Ali, Foreman, Tyson, maybe Rocky M cus he went undefeated. That's about it.
How obvious is it that Tyson didn't want the AJ fight. 2 minutes to organise the Wilder fight, 4 months of organising the AJ fight and then flaps it at the end. How can he appear on TV like this and be proud of himself. Absolute coward.
No one wants to see this fight. Fury will destroy him again.
Fwkin yanks trying to ruin the British dominance in boxing with dirty tricks(because they haven't got a good boxer)..listen to your dad Tyson and get the F out of there!
My man speaks no nonsense
T.B.E. The gypsy king Tyson Fury  He has no equal There isn’t even a man on his level
Nobody wants to see him destroy Wilder again, do the decent thing and move aside.
After everything he say he should SAY SIKE
Why don't he fight AJ no one wants to see a 3rd wilder fight
❤️ Tyson Fury! 🥊🏆
Im just a fighting man, i will fight anybody, but not AJ.
He has ZERO Charisma Zero Excitement.
He's goin ta give him a worser baiting
Tyson is the best of the best! Top 3 ever Ali, Iron Mike and Fury and there is no one is better than the other, because it don't matter!!
This is the white mohammed ali👆🏻
Fury is a runner the way he's avoiding AJ
I hope he has padding in his gloves this time...Fury setting all kinda records...No Boxer has as many court cases from opponents he was supposed to fight than broke the agreement...Also hes the first fighter to dent an Opponents(wilder) Skull which is strange if you have padded gloves
Oh no he has the Versace curse ...I think now fury will loose 😄
Deontay doesn’t even take Leg 🦵🏽 Day serious yep he will Fold like a Lawn Chair again.
The next fight takes place in 2089. Its soon so keep training.
I can’t wait to watch the fight at the big big big stadium.
Funny how everyone is so confident Tyson Fury will win except Tyson Fury.
Hate this crazy
He gon get caught slippin this time
No I don't think he will cos his gloves  will be properly checked..
Is it just me or does Tyson fury sound like Michael bisping
Tyson is changing 😔😔👋👋..
He'll duck Joshua forever just like Wilder did.
Luke is a fraud...... Come back to London and collect your beating......
Well....he didn't lie
Absolutely brilliant freeze out by these two
That was class form Tyson Fury, that’s the best smack talking from him I’ve seen in a while
for the love of god just give us joshua vs fury. its the only fight we care about
How ? Is he going to let the glove slip down even further?
really bummed the Joshua / Fury was called off :/
Tbh neither wilder nor fury can fight. Now with the recent training wilder has shown, he’s definitely improved. Fury has showed anything and I doubt he gonna go for the trilogy. If I was that confident I’d win again then why not?🤷🏾‍♂️ He’ll call out Ngannou but not Wilder🤔 Easy money tho, right?
Surrounded by a bunch of yes men
So pissed off Fury v AJ wont be happening, these 2 fights before hand just for money
I fear for Wilder's health this time. It's going to be personal, and he's outclassed. Barring a lucky punch, this one will end his career.
I believe him wilder sucks
Tyson should wake up & take his Dad's advice
He asked for 150M from the pagan shikh but want 20M a piece for a bare knuckles odd
After another utter humiliation wilder will have no choice but to retire
Big big big stadium 🤔
Lol cocaine sniffles
idk why this fight is even happening, it was an absolute mismatch last time
He wasn't even hitting him with his glove @ 2:36, lol. That was bone on bone.
Fury is Half Mad.. difficult to beat him
Boxing is in such a bad state and it’s for 1 reason...Bob Arum!!! He has essentially stopped one of the biggest boxing matches in history from happening. I will not be watching this “trilogy” 🙄
Fury funny.
DUCKED AJ
You're about to get slept Fat man. Night night.
The fight no one cares about. Let's all boycott, yeah?
Nearly 20 years and I still don't know how they managed to bring down WTC7.
If Wilder doesn't improve his basic boxing skills, a mediocre heavyweight like Fury will beat him again.
Fury can't afford to look past Wilder. I hope he's taking this more seriously that he appears, because Wilder is still dangerous.
All y’all white peoples weird 😕 he cheated and y’all talking about he won 😕😭 bye wilder coming for the kill 😭
No one cares
Nobody wants to watch this fight again. At least not now. Maybe if Wilder had come back and had some impressive wins showing that he's improved on some things. We want Fury vs Joshua. People shouldn't tune in for this. But I hope Fury embarrasses Wilder though, it's ridiculous he's making him fight him again.
Lets say that for a fact... states something purely subjective
Wilder is a stand right in front of you 1-2 puncher....he is NOT a quality boxer. Fury has far superior movement and boxing IQ. He’s going to beat Wilder easily...again.
Go for it Tyson - the world loves you!
Proof that money can't buy style.
He won’t ever fight Joshua. To risky for him
Moan the fury
If Wilder reads these comments he might learn something which to improve. Question is how fast of a learner is he. You cant go and fight with tension gotta be in a dancing modus.  He might want to watch Rob Font how to jab jabjabjajbjajab use the reach..use footwork   Simply said Wilder has the power to knock out but Fury has the will to stand up and trade anytime. So whats the best way is to fight smart and just have fun in the ring.  No need to be angry and tryna get the one punch hit.
Wilder needs to become a better boxer this time around.  We know he has power, but he needs to outbox a boxer to beat Fury.
Wilder about to wipe out the heavyweight division!! Fury dead man waking AJ next
He also said that Saunders would beat Canelo lol
Wait what? Wilder doesn’t deserve a rematch
He sound like Jason Statham
Can’t wait for the press conferences
Worst than last time? He KNOCKED YOU OUT COLD for 9.98 seconds last time lololol
You cheated and you know that deep in your soul. Those gloves you used for cheating, they will be your nightmare.
Tyson Furrey you would get smashed by Wilder.......
Is he wearing a Patek?
Tyson Is Going Loose His Titles. Way Too Much Chat.
Tyson Fury is a legend
Not a stable person.
He'll beat him worse than last time... that's cute
Oh I’m agree with that
Oh I’m agree with that
I never knew how much of a trash talker this man is 😂
Fury. ...You Are The MAN!!!!!!!!
Anything can happen in a rematch...can't wait for this fight
Wow he’s gonna absolutely destroy Wilder
They all on the gear
Is it me or does Tyson have a LISP?!?
Best boxer now
ما قال انشاء الله ، صدقني بتروح عليه.
what a fraud, ducking AJ
he is going to smoke wilder again...and he is 100% correct. he is the only boxer even worth watching. shits boring.
Let’s just hope he don’t cheat again
Come on the gypsy king 👑 lay that skinny dosser out
I've been dreading this trilogy. It will be so hard to watch the build up to the fight. All the press conferences, the promotions. Fury used to out trash-talk Wilder before he smashed him. Now what on earth  will Wilder say???
Check them gloves this time.
Not a big Fury fan. I hope this time Wilder wins with a big KO. Also hope AJ beats him in early rounds.
He will beat him if he cheat like always
The adhesive married routinely nail because aunt resultspreviously tire qua a ludicrous bangle. alluring,  flippant shoemaker
That is a fact cuz.
i love fury ...i love him so much i wanna see him lose so we get a rematch.... wilder is a comic book baddy with his over the top racism.  we become what we hate wilder.... wilder is a character himself...a personality.... and it was nice seeing them after the first fight with  mutual admiration and respect for each other... thats what all sport needs.  if Deonte loses the racism... and focuses his energies on bashing racists and not white people... id have his back.
Wilder is getting schooled again.  He took no fights to show he can box.  He will resort to his old form when the 💩 hits the fan.  You can train on YouTube all you want but when Fury manhandles him there will be panic.
Well see for Wilder V Fury III

Fury gloves had no padding! 😁
My god I hope Wilder knocks him out. Sick to my back teeth listening to this arrogant man.
Boxing really needs more fights. I know there was/is the health thing, but going forward let's see more fights!
he would defeat wilder only if he cheat by tampering with his glove as usual
Cap
Fury holding on to the title without fighting is bad press for boxing
wilder beats fury
I don't really care of Fury/Wilder and I'm even tired of it. My wish was ad many to see Fury/Joshua, that's most of us want
Let me guess people are blaming hearn and AJ for this?🤣🤣
Man I really miss the real heavyweight days.
Fury is gonna win
Fury beat him first fight clearly!!!! KO'd him second fight.... this third fight is a joke! boxing is a joke! money grab!
Lmaoo not without cheating
The obeisant novel arthroscopically decay because granddaughter acceptably charge above a precious jury. petite, organic cockroach
Hopefully his glove 🥊 isn’t pack and all the way on
He’s the man he is right he’s the only voice in the Heavy weight division that can put two words together and box 📦🤣
Fury gonna murder both that's a double im adding to man city winning champion league final and honeysuckle winning champion hurdle in 2022 at Cheltenham
I don't know about that bro
He's right about one thing. He is a character.
Deontay Wilder is one of the worst “boxers” I’ve ever seen. He can’t “box”. Dude throws haymakers the ENTIRE match. His movement, counter punching, and defense is AMATEURISH at best. If Fury keeps this fight in the center of ring and makes it a boxing match again. Wilder will get destroyed.  He is out of his league. Period.
Bombsquadddddddd
That last part he said was so true. Boxing is in a really bad place right now, especially when compared to the UFC.
Bombsquad 🇺🇸
NPC on the right waiting to turn on upto 1:20
Yea if he doesn’t cheat this time but I think wilder would destroy fury now , wilder has more power
But when Mayweather floss' he's a show off. Smh
Wilder will f??? You from behind this time drunk loser garbage king
Does anyone care honestly? I'm so bored of this drug cheat. I don't want to see him beating up Wilder again. Another nail in the coffin for the sport.
I feel this will be a big upset to the gypsy flop
Tyson "FACTS" Fury
Disgrace for sport for not making Joshua - Fury... Bad ppl run boxing
Once you beat someone once, you're likely to beat him always. I know this for a fact.
Tyson is a Fluke
Fury within 4. Fight me
Hmmm, Gypsy King.... Very powerful.
This guy is a fraud....
I’m betting $100 on Wilder... Who wants the smoke?
if there are no massive crowd i dont want to see fury joshua fight until its the real deal
👁️
Fury can't big up this fight, it's a no fight, shame for boxing fans.
Ducked Joshua. Shameful
Lets go Wilder USA! USA!
Wilder can’t beat fury. Plain and simple
it's kinda hard to top the last win, though. but if wlad couldn't land the right, wilder won't against an in shape fury.
This guy seems to be drunk or something.
To be fair AJ did a lot for boxing as well. In a different more mainstream way.
I feel like tyson is getting ahead of himself wilder looks totally different now
maybe his team should learn how to make contracts before this next fight since  they didnt even attempt to stop him from stepping in on the aj - fury fight  it just shows fury's team dosnt want this fight
If Wilder lose this time he's done
I do believe tyson fury is the best heavyweight in the world and would beat joshua comfortably because he is a strong but predictable fighter who gets kos through combinations .i think the wilder fight is more dangerous because his power is just on another level to joshuas .wilder still has a punchers chance and what a punch he has.i think fury wins because hes shown he has the ability to climb off the canvas if he does get hit while joshua quit against ruiz the first time. Im going for another fury win but wilder is always dangerous.
Can’t wait for Wilder’s next batch of excuses
This guy is bigger taller and is supposedly a better boxer. If I had that advantage over Wilder who he says can't box. Then their would've never had to be a rematch.
That's true Tyson Fury is carrying the boxing world right now
I believe him
Wilder let’s gooo!!!!
Fury should come out with a 50 pound bag strapped to him
Even tho both fighters haven't fought in a while, my money is on the champ because he's the better boxer.
Wilder by KO
US presenters suck off Fury so much ffs
Tyson honestly looks like he's in the best shape of his life. Looking great! Wilder should be a breeze...
no gloves-cheat this time
I believe he’ll beat Wilder even worse cause what some people may have forgot , is that he was coming out of that fight fresh off the drugs and alcohol. Time has past and he looks even more healthier, and his body has cleansed more, so yeah this should be good.
It's funny how people ignore things that they don't want to respond to  he said something about that glove or putting something in his glove and he didn't speak on that at all  he didn't say I have too much integrity to ever cheat the game or to put something in my glove or to do something unfair he didn't even address it and it's a big controversy and a lot of videos and you know that glove look funky when you see that fight
Beat Wilder worse than last time? Nah no way. Hopefully next time you wont cheat and Wilder definitely wins big.
There will be and Fury- Wilder fight on 27 july ??? Woow...that's cool  news !
Tyson fantasy continues Wilder going to reverse the roles this time - he buckled down & knuckled up to make Luke look lame Wilder winning the game.
I want him to beat the snot out of wilder this time round to the point he will forever be called hermit wilder
Wilder is going to try and outbox Fury. Big mistake. Fury will wreck him.
boxing would be boring without him, he isnt wrong
Dude controlled the fight last time
Hope you will be able to stand up 3 round
Another heavyweight snooze fest trilogy,Zzzzzzzzzzz....
Please Pray that the asswhipping Wilder will be getting won't be severe
What a clown. Never intended to fight Joshua. Arum and Warren are frauds. Anti-boxing
Boxing is such a joke now no wonder why the UFC take over and it’s the face of combat sport, fans wanted to see fury vs aj for years and it doesn’t seem like to happen any time soon in the future,and I’m not talking about this fight in general mayweather vs pacquiao took about 5-6 years buildup to happen its just lame, boxing fans deserve much better than this.
FURY CHEATED
LOOK AT FURY'S GLOVES
I think it will b closer than most expect  Wilder was still able to land some big shots early on in the 2nd fight
My guyyy
I don’t care about wilder vs fury anymore.... Fury is obviously the better fighter! I want Joshua vs fury
Glovegate confirmed
This man is LEGEND and we are lucky to see!!!
Why he look like a white Steven A smith 😂😂😂
Forget the step aside money just give him another wholloping!!!
Man you can tell Fury wanted AJ but Bob's running his operating system, goodness me.
Fight him again. Bare knuckle left hand with Wilder. Mr Muffin Top
So this time is he going to pour cement in the gloves instead!?   Cokehead, steroid cheat, glove cheat Fury!
Buy bitcoin.
Tyson has become a loud arrogant bloat.
Love to see fury get knocked out by Wilder
I swear, if wilder knocks out fury..I'm going to cry.
Training hard? Getting fat af more like. He needs to start acting like a champ and not a clown
Fury is a Fraud. I was a Fury fan but after this absolute trash wilder rematch where he had signed to fight AJ I realise the whole team were on the same scam. I hope AJ knocks the Gypsy King out
Tyson loves all this being in the limelight feeling the excitement of big challenges. He’ll miss this when he retires. Best character in boxing and well miss him too.
History shows us that the guy that won the last fight normally wins the second fight better. We’ve already seen this with the first two. Hope Tyson takes this threat seriously and beats him well again.
looks like he took his family and got the heck out of Great Britain. Funny how that works when you make your country into a prison camp.
big words for the guy who ducked the AJ fight.
"Joshua says I talk too much but if I didn't talk, boxing would be stone dead"  😂😂😂 Hype up the fans for this and do something else in just minutes Yeahh  Whoever feels what a dialogue fury said, are puppets of words and not reality.
He does own wilders soul facts
Fury Iced out 😂😂😂 he's comfortable now, Wilder just let it go fam, quit while you're ahead
I believe him. He wants to make Wilder give up all hope of ever stepping foot in the ring with him again
“If I didn’t talk boxing would be stone dead because I’m the only character left here in it..” Facts!
Wilder should not be fighting Fury again. He’s going to mess up his career.
I'm hearing Fight Night, man.
Stop trying to make a lying snake sound like the truth. When he loses to @DeontayWilder he can crawl back across the pond
Fury getting to cocky, wilder isnt no pushover. Hope fury gets KO'd.
Wilder looks like a different fighter from the clips I’ve seen. He’s got a new team and looks like more of a polished boxer, counter punching, defense, movement. Not just looking for the big shot... he’s still the big underdog, but he’s a better fighter then he was last year. Sadly so is the gypsy king . Fury in 7
Jake vs tommy will be a huge fight... I don’t think Jake wants it though
Batman Fury or Apollo Creed Fury?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 wait didn’t the judge say the next fight is on even playing field?? Fury is fucked smh
Shots fired
We see you punching with your wrists in this video there was something in your gloves you go from almost getting knocked out to almost killing the man in the early rounds lol
That is true he’s got the most character in boxing right now 🥊
He will
It should be a good fight I hope to see it
Lmao I don’t see one speck of fear in this man
No way, anyone noticed you can see tyson fury’s legs under the top rank sign through the desk?.....mad
Did he just forget the name of the big big big stadium 🙈🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hey Fury you should ask for a bigger Ring like Billy Saunders on your next figth
Wilder gone win this time
The ludicrous porcupine scilly spell because flock perplexingly weigh a a whimsical discussion. pleasant, rich snowman
Biggest cheating fraud,lier boxing ever been
How?... with titanium in the gloves this time ? 😂😂
A reality show with connor and Tyson hanging out would be great
I believe him 😁👏🏽👏🏽
Fraud  won't Wake up from sleep this time around!!
I think fury should wear the same outfit as deontay did in the last fight and destroy him that would be the ultimate victory
what if wilder wins🤣🤣
This is why boxing is the worst. No one asked for this fight but here we go. I hope Fury wins quickly and healthy so he can finally face AJ
WHAT A JOKE!!! I THINK TYSON NOW IS RUNNING FROM AJ, HOPE WILDER KNOCKS HIM OUT, TOOK ME ALL THIS TIME TO FIND OUT THAT FURY IS A FRAUD.
Tyson is pale they're going to let him cheat but Wilder knows now.. hope he don't kill Tyson..
Course you will lying to your back teeth didn't want to fight joshua because you never intended to fury
Probably
"I'm the only character left in it."  He's right.
Love the Gypsy King
So glad somebody finally came along to put Deontay Wilder in his place!! I mean I'm just saying he thought he was invincible got tired of his big mouth
2:46 Look no padding in his right glove...
AJ has a big mouth??
I say Fury vs Deontay in the UFC for their MMA debuts
Junky didn't win 1st fight lol
love this guy!
Wow living in America lol so much better than morchom or how ever you spell lol
This man is a hype and a cheat and boxing allows and celebrate it. Anything is better than a black champion.
Fury should wear Wilders old outfit or a copy to the ring and then whoop him.
lose that hat mate, you're looking like a yank A hole.
I support this
Clown had something in his gloves smh 🤦🏿‍♂️
Low key hopes he puts something nasty on fury
This guy is a joke he talks crazy reminds me of them Paul losers!
i just dont like this guy...............
I believe Wilder is going to beat Fury and he is going to beat him badly.
Fury may get smashed this time. I believe his ways will catch up to him this time.
Fury is definitely a character lol
I hope his gloves would be normal 🥊 ones !!
They took AJ for a ride all along. They do these things with Eddie Hearn time and again.
I will not happen in July fact , 🐓🐓🐓🐓
Give it too em Tyson
I feel like crying to my mother and screaming “I. WANTED. FURY/AJ!!!”
Tyson got horrible dress style even his jewelry is trash 😒
Mate yuo shud be in gym
Floyd Crawford spence paq and canelo is more skilled than fury ever areas
Im a bigger AJ fan, but he is absolutely right, he's pretty much the only entertaining boxer outside of the ring right now
Ducker 🦆
Disappointed in fury thought he wanted the AJ fight
When did the baddest man in the planet care about your mental health before?
I give it to fury, he can sell a fight!!!! I hope wilder wins!!!!
just keep those fists in those gloves fury!
Hes obviously not seen wilders new training camp lmao fury u are in for a real test wilder guna smash u he has nothing to lose fury has it all to lose fact
Ooook floppy glove
Can’t wait for the press conference
so basically the fans have been conned...
Fact!!!
Wilder the most over-hyped h/w in boxing history, would never make it into the all time top twenty, come to think of it, neither would Fury.
Fury managed to brainwash the public into thinking Joshua was fake and a ducker ... oh how things have turned.
Why is he dodging AJ? Come on gypsy king
I just wanna see a 10 round exhibition between Tyson fury vs mike Tyson
You nailed it KING ....!
2:15 Tyson is a showman.  Will Fury beat Deontay worse than he did the second fight? What excuses will Wilder concoct when he suffers more brain damage?
Fury to believe his own hype and come unstuck to the last ditch wilder
Fury is a coward!!!  ducked undisputed to fight one trick pony Wilder!
You hit him by the ear luckily this time wilder going to knock you smooth out Tyson fury
For some reason I see Wilder beating fury this time. Fury had a good shot in the 3rd round that damaged wilder's equilibrium which took his legs away, the same thing that happened to AJ in Ruiz 1. This time I see it bring much closer
Fury will destroy wilder
Come on gypsy king,, smash that spaghetti wilder again.. bring the big fight to uk  with Joshua.. love from an Afghan fan.. ♥️♥️♥️♥️I love his attitude he is comfortable in his own skin thts what's best about him.. he got Afghan mentality like lion
A.j gotta big mouth ..remained dignified throughout the fury driven pantomime.. fury just been exposed as a liar that's all . Im notban a.j fan but Even fury fans are feeling let down in the u.k .
Fury should come out wearing a chicken outfit ran from a.j like the roadrunner.beep beep
Tyson Fury is the last remaining character in the heavyweight division . I certainly don’t tune in when Wilder or Joshua are given screen time. They are lame and lack flare. Truly! Both take themselves to seriously. Joshua also tried to appear well spoken and Wilder is a big dumb dumb. He babbles about himself and his greatness when truly he’s just a puncher , not a boxer by any means. Fury has his ticket now. The only way Wilder wins a rematch is if Tyson beats himself somehow.
Absolute let down of a fighter,
Wilder's the kind of guy, who could walk to the ring wearing his shorts and shoes only, but after losing would claim that they were too heavy and killed his legs. And we get the third one with him? C'mon. Only the fight promoters win in boxing. Nobody fights nobody, so the golden cherry won't get spoiled.
I think both these guys have spent more time running their mouth than actually running & training.
KNOCK OUT - THE BOMBER WILDER.....Fury will retire after this fight.
It ain't gonna happen the way you think Fury
but then the pac stood up and raised everything higher!  Lets go boxing i need to see fights
Destroy him Fury get another TKO make that ref stop the fight or knock Wilder's head off.  Wilder been working harder then ever on his training show him it was all for nothin lmfao can't wait for this fight.
Fury is 💯
I no a crack head when I see 1........im from the inner city......the hood...🤣🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
like we care -ducked a j
For all the talk, I don't think it will end in a KO. Wilder sucks but he will surely come in better prepared (i.e. 20 pounds lighter) than last time and Fury knows he's got the beating of him, so will probably take it easy and coast to a wide points win.
Pampered Gloves we all know that shut up Fury ! You could actually see it when there showing he’s post fight picture hahaha 🤣 he ain’t not champ he knows that deep now he well always be cheater 👏🏽
Tyson is going to beat him viciously.
Who even cares, Fury and Wilder are both bums!
CANT WAIT FOR THIS ONE
thats facts at the end
I dont care what  Luke Fury says. I have never paid for one of his fights and I never will now. He ducked the biggest fight for years that boxing wanted to see. Him and Wilder deserve each other. Neither of them want to fight AJ.
Gypsy Princess shut up and fight
His fingers cramped up  Is this a standard profesional deformation for boxers?  I know a couple people that had this happen to    due to a lifetime of pickaxe field work. For them surgery was the only option. Its usually a pinky or a ring finger.
A bare knuckle brawl like Wilder 2
And I believe in Fury's prediction and this will be a painful payday for Wilder
🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆
FURY AINT WRONG!!! FURY WHERE THAT OUTFIT WILDER WORE LAST TIME
The noiseless heaven curiously skip because macrame causally invent apropos a nonchalant brass. therapeutic, hesitant john
Fury looks like he walks around with bad BO, but no one can say anything.
just make sure you wear your Gloves the right way lolollll
Wilder has no chance,he schooled him in the 1st fight,and stopped him in 2nd..i mean what can wilder do to beat him?.Fury took his best shot and he got up
Be careful. I said it with BJ against Canelo. I'll say it now. Wilder has changed training, he's changed trainers, he's changed styles. Wilder was a terrible boxer using that immense power. If he learns to box, move, work the jab and use the power he'll be devastating.
I think Wilder wins the next because Fury will go in underestimating him this time and we all know all it takes is one right hand to that glass jaw. Mark my words I’ll take any bets Fury does not have that one punch K.O POWER
He cheated and espn is hiding it
why tf like tyson dressed as someone just got a vacation from hawaii?
ol floppy gloves fury. check his gloves ref
All respect lost for Fury
No he avoided AJ that he knew He was going to fight  Wilder but he is counting his Last time On the WBC throne
The flow is amazingly good throughout the whole interview, it is really nice to listen too.
Fury the fraud
He got Ko'd in the first fight. Won 2nd fight behind more controversy than any fight in the last 40 years. Sounds like he's trying to convince himself or Wilder.
Yawwnnnn
I love The Gypsy King!!
He reminds me of a more likable Conor McGregor.
I’m hoping Wilder lay his azz out
Them gloves need to be recorded 24 hours until the fight
Gonna cheat again?
Unless your blind and dumb its obvious fury cheated could he still win maybe but he  He doesn't have confidence in his punching power that's why we talk to his sparring partner and he co firms the glove tampering his God dam fist is where the laces are supposed to be tight and don't forget they shut the camera off in the dressing room and he got caught vs CHRISTIAN HAMMER CHEATING LOOK IT UP ITS A FACT
```I turned $700 into $6000 just in one week with the aid and guidance of Linda I have been receiving good signal's from global service thank you```!
Predator will crush Fury in 2 rounds👍
I guess he's gonna have that blunt object stitched underneath his skin this time around. Pathetic crackhead....
Fury is a steroid cheat fraud and gets a pass from fans cause he's white.
Deontay Wilder finna come back with a vengeance!
small arms
That last line was FACTS
Lennox Lewis would knock this fool out if they fought in their days 💯
I love the way he destroy the bronze bomber but i believe there is something ain't right on Fury's gloves
His to scared to face AJ
Not interested😡his biggest fraud ever
Hilarious😂😭
Just like he said billy joe will knock out Canelo with a jab ahahahha
Not Anthony joshua who has big mouth with no substance,  is you TYSON fury.  youwont
He’s a cheater
cheaters!
This guy needs to be Humbled
Wilder should seek Canelos help
AJ got a big mouth lol hes got every right to say anything about you fury you big fat dossier. AJ next is it. Well.lets hope wilder knocks you out so you will never get to duck him again.
Unless Wilder changes his strategy (to who knows what) it'll be a similar result.
He's somewhat right being the only character left... Not completely true however Joshua is no entertainer.
Why Wilder never fought the cheating is what gets me.........maybe he was silenced.?
No, AJ revived heavy weight boxing this man is being dishonest here. Fury is the best, but AJ deserves his due.
At the moment fury is the top man, aj will have to wait
Will get KO this time 🤣
Vegas is Floyds
Wilder gonna get him this time! He's gotten too cocky. Watch god work.
Fury does quick work of Joshua. I think Joshua is relieved to be honest.
Yawn, the Gypsy Queen doing everything possible to avoid fighting AJ, she couldn't sign the Wilder contract quickly enough. His resume ain't that great either has a track record of not defending belts.
Fury is a fake guy now we know he didnt want to joshua
I mean, he’s probably right if we’re being honest here
Ducking AJ
Fury lost so many fans over this.  Aj ducker
Better check his gloves twice next time
Fury is dressed like a dance-teacher for kids from the 90s
He looks like he’s back on the white stuff
What y’all gone do if wilder win?
Wilder needs to step aside.
Fury is such a POS... it’s amazing to me that he’s arguably the most known cheater ever in boxing but nobody cares because he’s cool. All good tho, many real fans know he’s a cheat.
Tyson Fury is number one. Wilder after the fight with Charlie zelenoff He wasn't the same Wilder anymore.
What is Fury playing at?! He’s delighted but he has walked away from the biggest fight in history, 5x the money he’ll get for this fight and is trashing his reputation by letting everyone down. He never wanted the AJ fight after all. He’s been making mugs of everyone - including the fans. But why?
Fury beat him twice like really?
Why is joshua out of The fight ?
What a joker. He’s got some nerve after ducking AJ
Funny thing is Fury is telling the truth. The whipping he puts on Wilder this time might force a retirement
Fury cheater , Good luck Wilder
They better check them gloves thoroughly this time.
I don't trust Fury as far as I can throw him bet you the mental health thing is a big lie. Wested our time cowards you and Wilder hoarding the belt
Sad to see nobody in the comments talk about how disgusting this guy is for the sport of boxing.. He’s a class boxing talent, but he’s one of the biggest cheats the sport has ever seen.. I’m sick of him and he’s gonna get knocked out, either by Wilder or Joshua..
Does anyone care
He will win but it won't be easy like he did last time i guarantee u people.
Fury stay in American he's lot better there
FURY is going to son Wilder again 💯
Word on the streets wilder just got new legs it's on now
He ditched us brits and wont ever fight again in the uk😂 he says he’s a fighting man but has never defended his belt and you fury fan boys rate him...
Stop all da CAP
He made his point at the end.. factz
I lost count of all the excuses Wilder and his fanboys made for that 2nd fight loss lol.
Wilder never should've took this fight.
Learn to fight with your gloves on correctly and then you can talk about beating deontay
Feather-fisted fraud.
Was a big fury fan before this nonsense about the Joshua fight, he clearly ducked the fight and it’s not even up for debate, hate wilder but he hope lands a bomb on fury. That would be called karma
I am guessing there is no VADA testing...Fury is clearly off his box.
Same result for me and the Gypsy 👑 STOPS Beyonce Windmill Wilder
if deontay wins tough,it might be first time  2 fighters fight for the fourth time
Male witch!
Let's go bomb squad Gypsy King you're getting smashed sweet revenge is coming
Wonder if hes gonna sprinkle the same Gypsie dust / magic that Saunders used? Someone order this man a Versace robe!
What a fake the whole sportsscene is and the ones hosting are sellouts.
Speaking facts ,gota love some fury!haha
Just don’t get knocked out clean. That should do it then.
Ppl saying Fury ran from Wilder are insane. Look at Fury. Does it look like he runs from anything?
What a disgrace to the sport, the fans and his people. ESPN yall knew what was going down. Frauds! Lol
Yessssssss yesssssss yesssssss
Lol boxing is a c tier sport for Americans its good to see the Brits keep it alive
Such a clown... get off this clowns nuts... hes a joke 🤡
De Facto, TF's beaten DW 2x. If it's real,  it's W#3, but maybe a dive to make #4 the $$$ fight.
Look at those arms
America = Banana Republic
Tyson is going to serious hurt Deontay!!!  Deontay lack of boxing skills has finally caught up with him.  He's going to get punished.
I’m picking Dustin over McGregor, Manny over Errol and Tyson over whoever.
Wilder never fought anyone before he fought Furry.  Wilder should move to mma. He certainly can't box.
Wonder what excuse will that mallate put next Tyson slap the fuk out of that mallate
Wilder will stop Fury in a very brutal way
*1st fight* - Wilder won two rounds & Fury outboxed him all the other rounds. *2nd fight* - Fury utterly dismantled Wilder. *3rd fight* - Why are we here again?
Wilder will always be a better fighter than your flabby fraud Fury. All real fighters know that!
How can a guy from the uk claim Vegas and get away with it oh yeah he is WHITE lol hahahahaha gtfoh
This dude is not a real champ he's a fraud
He so right about no one caring about boxing without him
Man talks way too much crab.. Can't wait till somebody gives you some good beating 😐
It's a shame Joshua keeps on ducking real opponents, it really is.
One thing we do know is Peter the Cheater's gloves will be thoroughly checked this time.
Wilder really aught to write out a LW&T before this fight because his corner wont save him this time for fear of being branded traitors and fired during the ensuing excuse brigade.
Lololololololololololol
ooh how they love the hyped white hope lol
Nobody wants to see Fury Wilder 3 .. fury made Wilder look so average last time
Watch him get knocked out😆😆😆😆
When will American sport broadcasters understand that the guest is supposed to do more talking than the presenter? It’s painful.
Arum & Warren, his handlers, didn’t say one thing when Eddie Hearn was going left and right to sort the Joshua fight. They didn’t try to hype it or promote it. Do they really want the fight?
Looks like his on the coke🤣😅😂
He also said he’d give the £7m he got against Wilder to homeless charity. Big Fraud
He also said Saunders would beat  Canelo
Deontay will beat the white off him
Fury has a point HW division would be boring with out him.
Wilder,  are you ready for duble punishment then  last time by King of heavyweight boxer Tyson Fury?
Must gonna cheat again!
This is a total setup. Fury could have cancelled that contract with Wilder back in December. He doesn't want to fight joshua plain and simple.. Like Ortiz, he takes one look at Joshua and depite the bigger money, goes for the easier fight against Wilder.. He's used the undesputed to sell the Wilder 3 fight which nobody wants to see.
he may be a sucker for punishment but you gotta give him props for willing to run it back at it either way i want a third fight no matter what the outcome
He ain’t lying he the only one that makes real boxing interesting
He'll probably cheat like last time too
America routin against a actual American going for the visiting team... smh.  Only black Americans get no love from they own people.  Won't no other country do that. Sad
"Double Double Trouble Smash Him" 🤣🤣😂😂😂
Tyson and Ruiz are my favorite fighters besides Alvarez
Man i think fury loses now. For some reason we won't see aj vs fury or wilder vs aj watch
pathetic. ducking joshua. furys just words.
This will be Wilders last fight.
He will too... I fear for Wilders safety when fighting this man... He probably  should not...
He already beat deontay in a bareknuckle fight.. just deontay didnt get the memo and he wore real boxing gloves.
Wow after watching this..... he cheated with the gloves smh
His gloves were manipulated and you can see it from many photos. If the new ref and Wilders new corner sees it he won’t get away with it. Fury will get knocked down by 6th rd and will be KOd cold by 8th. He will not get up this time. The fact he has been dodging the rematch says how much he’s scared considering there was a rematch clause in the first place. All these promoters been lying for a year about this fight not happen and instead pushing for a Joshua fight. Al Haymon has been the only honest one and even got Spence vs Pacquiao deal without all this bs talk. I can’t wait to see the betting odds I bet no one believes he’ll do anything significant in the third after the glovegate evidence plus the Fury v AJ fight talk without mentioning Wilder this whole time. Justice will be served 👨🏻‍⚖️⚖️
Fury will be stopped this time
Tyson the ducking dosser Fury, avoiding AJ at all cost!
Deadset flog
what a blowhard
pride cometh before the fall...Tyson is likely going down, and he better not have bad gloves this time!
Tyson Fury was too big and strong 💪 like a Mack truck , while Wilder body was looking like a Volkswagen ready to get mash all night
@ 2:48 you can see how flat his gloves were
Fury gonna give Wilder a _worse_ hiding than last time?! Oof.. I think Wilder should just stay at home on his PS4 and just accept the third and final L.
everyone now thinks he has been scared of aj the whole time and im now thinking the same
has been a massive fury fan for years but i now doubt him like everyone else and call him a fraud . i believe he is scared of aj and im so gutted .
FRAUD!
Wilder should of used his brain here. Negotiated to fight the winner of AJ n Fury. To get the first crack more money and 5 belts in the line. Instead he will get whooped again by Fury. He has won 1 round in 17 !!!! What an idiot
He roccin that Richard Millie $250,000 I See You Fury 💰
Wilder by ko
The mountain ⛰ of lies throughout your history continues to pile up, until London Bridge 🌉comes tumbling down. 👎🏿
POPEYE FURY !!!
Fury will go to sleep, his gloves will be completely checked and his punching power will be like it was in the first fight, no padding removed equal same weak power from the first fight.
I hope Tyson doesn't take Wilder lightly. Either Wilders going to come out swinging for the fences or he's going to be staying on the outside trying to pick him apart.
Talk about the gloves you cheater🥊🥊🥊🥊
If Fury doesn't use his fixed/tampered with 🥊 he gonna get KO like in the first fight but he WON'T BE GETTING UP THIS TIME!!!
Do we really have to watch the two men who avoided AJ fight for a 3rd time? Boxing is a joke.
Fury is getting knocked out in this third fight.
CHEATER🥊👀.....PERIOD.
This fight happening instead of Fury vs. Joshua is what's wrong with boxing nowadays.
If Wilder wins no one wants another rematch, no one wants Aj v Wilder and Fury v Aj without all the belts on the line isn't as interesting
This is going to be a diff Wilder this fight. His training has been way different.  Im not saying that he’s going to win, but we’re not going to see what we saw in the second fight.
Ahh yes the fight nobody wants to see
Am I the only one who remember Tyson cheating to beat Wilder🤔
Fury and his fans are about to get a huge wake up call. I can't wait.
Looks like Fury is on crack again or he is still punch drunk from the Wilder punches to his face.
Wilder will K.O. Fury 💯 like he did in the 1st fight and was robbed.
He will.
I don’t know this time. I think wilder is hungry and Fury is taking him lightly. Shut up and fight. It’s making fury look too cocky. Humble yourself or be humbled.
Man o man, we have a lot to look forward to this summer!: Pacman vs Spence and now this!!!!
Why is there a duck in a waistcoat? Quack quack.
Fraud
Fury should be reacting differently I really wanted that joshua fight but doesnt seem so upset does he really want the joshua fight,this wilder thing wasnt really dealt with urgency because theres something wrong somewhere wasnt too long ago fury said he would have nothing got to do with wilder 20 million shouldn't stand in the way of being the greatest heavyweight.
What a massive bell end
TYSON FURY = MVP
fury runs boxing x3 over
The Versace will be the downfall of fury. We have all heard the legend of how the Versace robe is a sign of bad times to come for that person. It’s happened 3 times now, will it happen again? Only time will tell if fury can overcome the curse
Tyson fury is a turdhammer.
I have always been a big Fury fan, but he has shown his true colours. He is absolutely full of it, I don't think he ever intended to fight AJ. I hope Wilder drops him in the 1st and goes on to fight AJ for the undisputed in December.
I’m not a boxing fan, but I swear I always thought Tyson Fury was a black guy.
facts
tyson comes out with the song i lifted 16 tonnes  what do you get 🤣
Against modern boxing!
Yeah but he cheated??? AJ would expose him For the lumbering bully he is that’s why he promised us all a fight then the day after lost the arbitration case 😂 He has fought nobody but wilder who’s just a swinging lunatic and klishko when he was already to old Otto walk-in made a mess of his face and hardly touched Ajs why don’t people see the facts . With a boxing cv thinner than a crackhead he’s the real big dosser !!!
fury dont want no 3rd fight.he will vacate..he wants to fight bums.
didnt he cheat
U big dosser fraud
This guys a clown - All this jingle jangle jewelery reminds me of some one...Cap on backwards? please...
Tyson u talk tooooo much With little or no action
I dont think many people want to see these two fight for the 3rd time .         Fury Should Be Fighting Joshua          Wilder should be be fighting Ruiz or Usk
Same outcome if he shows prepared like last time
Can’t Mess With Fury!
Lol you cheat 🤣 😂 and you think  you're as good as the rest  just stop you too old for that
The pressure is on fury! They gonna check the gloves and for PEDs!
i wanna see mayweather fight fury
Wilder won’t be drugged this time!
I hope Deontay dresses lighter this time. Wouldn't want him to be tired again would we.
I can’t help but like Tyson Fury. Could listen to him talk all day and he backs it up in the ring, whereas Joshua just bores me to tears with his manufactured personality.
He’s the only person in boxing who can promote himself... there are no personalities left. That’s why Jake and Logan Paul are laughing to the bank
Joshua is only calling him a fraud because Fury is now forced to fight Wilder again. Don't worry Joshua your time will come, and you'll get smashed too. You are the most 1 dimensional fighter that I have ever seen.
What is he going to use this time... a ruger?
Fury will make wilder pay he is too big and too heavy
You spoke more than the fighter, what’s wrong with you ? Smh
Fury is just a better " boxer " plain and simple.  Until Wilder learns the science of boxing he likely won't beat Fury. That said , Wilder always has a punchers chance.
He dodged that tainted glove question lol.. This going to be a good fight though.
Need more like him!! Talk the talk amd walk the walk!!!
Hail the Gypsy King!
Im absolutely LOVING this energy 😈😈😈😈😁
Tyson has taken all but 2 rounds in both fights combined.
i was more interested in watching this interview than i am the fight, this fight has more sequels the than the Saw movies, quit with the 2/3 fight deals pleaseee
I wanted Fury & AJ
He probably lied about what he was saying here
Did Tyson lose a tooth? Sounds a bit lispy
If he don't cheat it should be wilder all day it's crazy how the treat this guy when he's a cheater if this was anyone else the would've been suspended our worse and not on national tv
This man is one of the underrated trash talkers I've ever seen. Everything he says is potent cold and sublime
COCAINE!!!
The gybsy king 👑👑👑👑👑👑
Turns out Fury never wanted the AJ fight. He's delighted now it's Wilder.
The fight is going to be closer than ppl think, Fury probably wins but like in the 7-9th
He probably will Wilder will get hammered trying to use ummastered skills and the go back to what he knows which fury would go back to what he did in the second fight
One fight i will not be paying to watch , pair of bums .
Tysons going to kill him
Fury u r a lemon with no juice
I find it incredulous that the Wildettes are crawling out of the woodwork claiming that the same bloke that was handed TWO boxing lessons has suddenly grown enough of a brain to be able to box well enough to beat a man of Fury's undoubted finesse. This third fight, although not a foregone conclusion (because it's heavyweight boxing)is a close to a foregone conclusion as it can be without being declared a mismatch. Wlider will be handed another beating and rather than accept he was beaten by a better man he will spit his dummy out and spew some ridiculous nonsense again.
I was going for wilder because he's american but gotta respect fury great boxer and came back from being overweight and depression
The sell is real... Like shilling a crypto currency
“I’m gonna double treble smash him, cause he didn’t get a good enough hiding last time” 😂
Fury be acting like he can pull more crowd than AJ
Fury is so afraid of Joshua he's relieved the fight did not come on. He doesn't want to fight Joshua because he will embarrassing him
Anthony Joshua is a coward and always have been
It's a sad world when an outside source who is a hired "impartial mediator" in a specific field and/or area of expertise has the power to decide the outcome of a sporting event of this magnitude. Someone who is not connected to the sanctioning bodies or the sport of boxing other than a hired split divide specializing in the sporting world industry (maybe). This should've been a simple fix solution. Compensation payment to Wilder with a guaranteed mandatory date to take on the winner between Fury vs Joshua for the undisputed heavyweight championship. Done deal. Wilder gets compensation in the mean time but a guaranteed date (after) to fight for all the titles and opportunity to salvage his legacy. Everyone not only makes out, but now the promotion teams get to set "duel date championship fight events" between the top three heavyweight boxers in the world today.
Has all the money in the world and still decides to dress like a bellend
My money is still on the black man
Running from AJ
there is great fighter's than fury.why this guy gets so much publicity.he never defend any of his titles.this guy is bad for boxing.mister gloves
This is exactly why most people don’t watch boxing no more it’s all about money not fighting there’s no reason for a third fight after the last beat down smh
Serious Question - Has Tyson lost a tooth in training? When did he develop a Mike Tyson/Chris Eubank lisp?
Tyson Fury  is my favourite sports personality EVER ! 🇬🇧
Not humble? god will humble fury ...
Fury will beat him worse than last time because he isn't going to tell him how he's going to beat him.   And Wilders brain will be thinking overtime about the little bits he's learnt in a short time.   He will be trying to put combos together thinking he's hitting a heavy bag. FURYS no heavy bag he can move and see them punches coming.  Wilder still can't see Fury's punches as not many boxers can he throws to awkward!!!  Fury knocks wilder out this time sleeping
Fury risked losing 200mil to save 20mill, to fight the harder fight. Yeh that make sense 👀. Sorry but this Fury character ain't the smartest
I get that Wilder wanted a body on his record but getting himself killed is probably not what he was going for.
Was going for wilder the first time even tho I knew he didn’t have a fight chance anyways..... BUT NOW fury knock this dozer and sore looser out
Man if it wasn't covid we would have had some crazy fights
Don’t know boxer need to mess around with Tyson ... I never thought I would see the day the sport was dominated by a white just saying he’s officially dominating the sport
As I heard Domonique Foxworth say “If you’re talking trash and you can back it up, that’s not bragging, that’s fact.”  I think he was talking about Steph but I applies to the GK too.
Wilders gonna walk in his underpants this time...
To be the man you have to beat the man... And fury is definitely the man! Honestly think he will retire undefeated... He is a legend 👍🏻 up da gypsy king 👑 👊🏻
Anthony is clearly scared of fury
U MEAN CHEAT WORSE THAN LAST TIME
Tyson licked the blood of Deontae wilders neck last fight 🥴 Deontae is going knock this fool out. 😂
Fraud..
Just make sure them gloves are on right this time
Love him but he tries too hard sometimes !
Shame he cheated
If fury beats him again wilder will say my new trainer spiked my water he is a Tyson fury implant most definitely lol 💯
Wilder will be very dangerous this time around. He should touch fury's body more and avoid head hunting because fury is far too elusive.
Ppl hate fury. Dude out box and out smarted wilder. Fury will do the some again an again.
It’s gonna be a fight champ. Do not be complacent, a wounded animal is a dangerous animal
Absolutely ridiculous they are fighting again.
Thought Morecombe was your home town, I think Wilder might beat Fury due to the many distractions in his life
Double stuff da glubs next time
BETTER CHECK THAT GUY’S GLOVES BECAUSE HE DID CHEAT AND BEFORE YALL SAY THOSE ARE ALLEGATIONS AND LIES..NO ITS PROOF OUT THERE AND ON THIS VERY PLATFORM.. HE CHEATED AND WAS CAUGHT IN THE UK FOR THE SAME THING.. LOOK IT UP AND TYSON FURY CAN BOX VERY WELL AND WILDER CAN’T.. WILDER CAN ONLY PUNCH WITH TREMENDOUS POWER..I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST FURY BESIDES THE CHEATING
They robbed us. Nobody wants this fight
Cheater!
Fury’s a fraud an a cheat I can’t believe a word out of his or Al mouth
Hope the check his gloves
Make sure you trust someone to check the wraps and gloves for Fury. No shame in it. Both fighters are amazing. All we want is a fair, clean fight.
Living his best life.
Let's be completely honest here shall we, Wilder does not deserve another crack at it, he's been exposed and burst twice now so why keep doing it?? He's a pointless fight and irrelevant to the heavyweight division now. He should be made to work through the ranks like everyone else has had to!! I hope this is his last chance because it's ridiculous now and there's better fighter's out there that deserve it more.
Fury literally and truly is the heart and soul of the boxing scene. He's by far the best boxer on the planet over all weights and is hilarious.
Quiet an fight j....
Fury cheated. Boxing gloves was not up to standard
Gypsy madness.
ESPN does a great job promoting Fury listen to that intro, I wish they did that for Terence Crawford.
Fury,  wilder will knock you out in 5 rounds....your a cheater, it's a known fact....
For a fact if fury wasn’t in the game it wouldn’t be interesting
The Richie mille on his wrist 💸💲
Fury be speaking facts
Fact checker here: I see no lies or bs
Fair play the only one making equal noise aren't even professionals
So did he cheat last fight or not....the gloves
3:12 facts Joshua is like the Steve Davis of boxing
Anthony Joshua doesn't hold all the cards now.... Now he can feel what it feels like to get rejected plus tyson is seen as the number 1 fighter Joshua is number 2 in the publics eyes
Didn’t comment on those gloves 🧤
Finding out Fury's got to fight Wilder again makes me want to fight Wilder myself tbh.Nobody wanted that fight again...even in the first fight when Wilder knocked him down he still got outboxed by Fury in every single round.It'll be a much tougher fight this time because I think Tyson's a motivation man if he's not 100% into it (and let's face it no one but Wilder is) it might prove hard to reach the levels required.I don't think we'll ever see that Fury Joshua fight now if I'm honest.
Deontay ain't playing! He gonna fucc him up this time. He mad!
Malik scott is one of the best brains and one of the most skilled boxers to ever step in the ring. He is now training wilder to destroy fury.
I like Tyson but the guy has zero style, clearly not everyone can pull off that McGregor SWAG
Man like TYSON FURY 👊🏼💥
Deontay's looking sharp and is definitely up for this fight, his new trainer seems to be doing the business...I do hope he also gets himself a new costume designer!
I hate both fury and wilder would be awesome if the simultaneously land rights and KO each other.
I think hes dragging it out because his first loss will be by AJ...
If Deontay wins (by a miracle)... will he step up (finally) to fight Joshua for all the belts or run off to fight contenders again? I would've preferred Deontay take this time off to rest and heal up. Let these 2 fight and he takes the winner for all the belts.🥊
Gotta love this guy!
Fury doesn’t look good.
Actually Tyson won the first fight
Fury might have to come in clean if so Fury is in trouble.  You don't gain power with legal gloves on , you can using an object with less padded gloves while on ped's
Man I wanted to see him vs Joshua.
LOL
Are u kidding me get this man's meat out y'all mouth. He cheated!!! He's no role model!
For the moment only deontey w can bring this guy down zero. I believe it. Deontey has to visit Africa to take his spirit back.
2:47 Furys glove😢
I thought Tyson gave all his money to charity, what’s going on here?
Don't want this fight feel bad for fury because he will get slapped silly and aj will end up beating Wilder as fury will be washed up and forgotten about .
Fury is spice talker lmaoo
Better check his gloves
Wilder loses 1 fight 1 FIGHT and he all of a sudden should never fight again??? The slander is really wild
No one wants to see fury murder wilder for a third time..ffs. Joshua vs fury is the fight..even Americans should want to see the undisputed first with wilder getting the winner.
Tyson is and WWE fighter
Now he's walking around like he can't get beat up.
So no talk on his getting busted for CHEATING??
Fury will destroy wilder before the fight in the press conferences. Wilder has a punchers chance that is all. Otherwise, Fury should do another demolition job on him no problem.
God American commentators are interminable.
Fury vs Wilder3 , will be WW3. Can't wait!!!!!!
If Taylor didn't drop Ramirez, he would have been robbed. America the land where you get robbed blind!
50 ka Target pura kardo And Thanks for 9 Love you All
Fury loves coca cola
Tyson outchea dressed like an undercover cop
The man cheated plan and simple
Where is that energy when it comes to AJ? Just fool your fanboys.
He still can't find a baseball cap to fit his head.
He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he has bourne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.  But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. ~ Isaiah 53:3-5  For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which is lost. ~ Luke 19:10  He willingly died an excruciating death on the cross for the sins of the world. God raised Him from the dead on the third day. He is coming back to judge the world in righteousness. See Matthew 24 for how the world will be before that day.   Seek Him while He may be found. ❤️❤️❤️
The more clothes wilder wore, the less for tyson!
STFU Tyson you Cheat now you can’t hide and run for 3rd fight 😕
why is  the fight with Joshua cancelt ?
Left bill jo after his loss too much confidance too his head should never sign a 3 with wilder hahaha and jake paul would hurt tommy fury real talk🤣
heavyweight really needs this man, absolute legend.
Wilder is going to do Fury very filthy.
"I just want to fight." Dude, you should of just fought him already and got it over with. You prolonged it way to long, now look what happened.
Drugs
Forgets name of arena:   Big big big stadium
🤣🤣I love fury’s interviews he’s class
Fury would beat up Wilder and Joshua in the same night LMAO
I hope you smash cry baby wilder that dude tried to pull everything even race card . You so in his mind that he said you cheated but he fired his coach lmao 😂 dude don’t know wat he wants to blame his loss on
It’s going to be bad for wilder. Tyson fury is going to destroy him again
Better have real gloves next time bub. And bayles won't be your ref.... Better be ready
It's true fury is boxing at the moment,  he's doing what boxing needs,  all the talk etc.  etc
Keep that same energy with untampered gloves cheater!!!
I’ve been watching boxing all my life and it shows how most of these comments are the younger generation supporting AJ with no reason behind why he will win. Fury will school AJ, like he schooled one of the best champs of his generation Klitschko, yeah AJ beat him too but a couple years later. Look what Fury did to wilder
Love it
Can't wait for the fights.
This fool is going out like Lance Armstrong .... cheater they made shure to show the right picture to .  Fury is just a fake Hero
He’s right about the character part. AJ is a good guy but a bit boring and wilder is a biblical psycho path, but Andy Ruiz has a great personality even thought at times he can be slow as well. Fury can take a punch and doesn’t seem to have lossed his step. Too bad he’s a cheater.
Hahahah! Tyson is hilarious😂😂😂😂😂
What's he saying he gonna cheat worse than the last two times ah ha
He should wear the robe Billy joe saunders wore
I believe him
The other dude has no sense of humor...doesn’t laugh at all at the beginning. Weird...
Playing with that sugar candy 🍭 🍬 😂
AJ said he won't fight Fury now after all that mucking around
If they let him cheat a third time wilder might d !  3 Smh
I dont care about a fight i dont want him to go to jail or prison no no no not at all i just want to see him get stripped and banned and live out the rest of his days in shame just like the russian in rocky if fury cheats again wilder might d ! 3 smh
The truth is he popped dirty and claimed to be depressed. People gave him a major pass and eat a yard of his act because of reasons I don't have to explain...
Cap 🧢
Wilder's my guy but...yeah, he might wanna leave Fury alone.
I think Tyson was trying to dodge the 3rd fight.  If he was so confident, he woulda took the 3rd fight before already.  Man up, and prove you can beat Wilder again, cause Wilder on a training rampage.
I doubt it because they going to check them gloves this time
Let’s see Tank Davis Baltimore’s own or even better coach Calvin Ford or Money 💰 Man Him Self
But he cheated right?
Fury is planned to resign here. He won’t get to fight Joshua. DW will kill him in 2 rounds anybody for a bet here.
Should give away his belts to wilder. Go fight Joshua instead
Only way wilder can come back after all the excuses and the knock out is knock furry out in the early rounds
wilder gonna make sure there's no floppy glove action this time.
Floyd Mayweather had to pay Maidana not to fight in those gloves
😂😁
Is there any interest in this fight whatsoever? Unless Wilder comes in with a new game-plan and new abilities, and assuming Fury trains properly, this is just going to go a similar way as last time. A little bit curious to see if Deontay can up his game, but beyond that, who cares?
i'm just glad a fight is signed at this point, instead of waiting another 6 months of negotiating.
Triple Face smash Tyson Fury the  Gypsy King 🤴 will win again Semper Fidelis always Tyson Furry the greatest the Champ .
Tyson Furry your the Champ 🏆 AKA Gypsy King 🤴 your the Best Train hard Tyson and beat him TKO for the 3rd Time . Wilder can shut his mouth once and for all. Tyson sending Marine Corps lov brother . Semper Fidelis always
By cheating
Wilder wanting one more payday before he becomes irrelevant
CHEATERRRRRR RUNNNNERRRRRRRRR
i just cant see any interest in this fight
Maybe if he uses the same gloves as last time.
The WWE has really helped him develop his brash persona
Big big big was his silverdome' moment
Can stand fury full of sh** BUT' the only thing i will agree with is Tommy Fury to smash the f*** out of jake paul
They had to cut him off because he was just contradicting himself! If you’re a fighting man an like to fight an you been waiting to fight !! Than why did Wilde have to go to court to fighting Dosser! your scary lying cheating ways will soon be Exposed
Why did we have to listen to a full minute of the host give his speech?  ask a question and let fury speak.
TWATS!
I hope he comes out looking like Lancelot in the heavy armour. F**k me, that will be the funniest ever.  Thats money in the bank
With cheating or without cheating?
No one wants to see this fight honestly. Wilder needs to go away. Or just start over. Tune up fights. Back to basics for real.
Wilder gon knock him out !
Kinda lost respect for Fury. How can he give it the big one and make it sound like the AJ fight is definitely happening and then suddenly pull out and fight Wilder? He should of fought AJ first. Big disappointment for fans
Nobody will throw the towel for Wilder for how he reacted last time...this fight is even more dangerous for him now.
Fury gonna send that boy to the gulag
Go Tyson!!!
Tyson Fury: Won world titles twice. Defended NEVER. I'm not a fan of Wilder either, but at least he defended against Ortiz and uhhh yeah, I guess that's his only credible opponent other than drawing with Fury...
ESPN is a big joke why don't you bring Deontay Wilder on we all know Tyson Fury cheated look at those gloves Tyson Fury looking like a big fat Shrek
Cocaine is a hellavah Drug.
Hope so can't be having Furry Wilder 4
Fraud...
Mark my word this guy is ready to retire .
What a fkn dinger, just get the fight on with AJ and crack on, anyway why has wilder come back into the subject 🙄🤔trying to avoid AJ,  Am sure this guy is back on the Charlie
Wilder can change the scene if he knocks out him with that right hand, it can happen.
Tyson fury is going to bully Deontay Wilder once again in the ring and in the press conferences. I can’t wait!
Ya big cheater you cheat fight number 2 you going to get knock  out
Bye bye Fury,  for the next remacht vs Wilfer😂😂😂
facts
Has fury developed a lisp during sparring?
Tyson the man come out a talks  how it is   not AJ and wilder keyboard worriers  shiting💩 them self's
Wilder will smash fury! Can’t wait to see wilder KO Fury! It will be priceless!
This man is a fraud. Using AJ's name for clout. He'll never step up, he'll keep fighting these bums
If confidence was gold Tyson's a nuggat 😋
D head
Tyson I understand why you had breakdown .although I’m short I’ve got the same body type .no matter how hard you train you can’t get that elusive six pack ; that what you have to sacrifice to get have your lightning reflexes lose skin .you have learnt to live with it : as the wise man said that’s your body type (your Dad ).Your a Great soul .
Tyson will end his career.
Deontay Wilder will have to chase Tyson Fury around the ring to beat him. Fury can't punch like Wilder. Wilder cannot outbox Fury. Wilder has to have absolutely no fear whatsoever and just charge through Fury's boxing skills. That is the only way Wilder can win.
Such a legend
Fury will probably move to America... Looks like it
Of course you will beat Deontay, Tyson-Steroid-Head-Fury-lmao! This clown thinks that he will find some way to cheat this time, lmao! You in for a surprise *Gypsy-king-of-steroids.*
Who tf is Shaq and Charles Barkley y'all employers who tap dance
This video is a third them introducing Tyson
"At the errrr....(thinking to himself "what the fucks it called again?") Big Big Big stadium" 😄
ESPN y'all 🦆🦆🦆🦆 Deontay Wilder y'all know y'all fighter is a lier and cheater y'all tried to pay that man step aside money y'all cheated that man out of the first fight and clearly y'all cheated him in the second
Make y'all give this a Thumbs down for ESPN having Steven A Snitch Smith forehead begging Deontay Wilder to step outside. This is all a deflection from glove gating that's why they book Anthony Joshua for the cover up
If I don’t fight Tyson Fury, someone else will  Jacob the thief in Israel 🇮🇱
ESPN sucks ask KWAME BROWN
If Fury can do it again I guess he is the man at heavy weight and if loses sweet revenge for Wilder. Hopefully Wilder learned from his loss and puts Fury in his place. No excuses this fight.
This is all getting boring now ...no doubt they'll have a rematch clause  on the rematch clause  & 10 fights later they'll still be no closer to getting  a unified Heavyweight champion
Tyson Fury engaged in standup wrestling in the second fight. He was all boxing in the first  fight that he really lost due to multiple knockouts.
Max kellerman is such a suck up 😂😂😂 to all the wrong fighters he's a suck up to canelo whose a cheater fury is a cheater.ask the man the real questions why was he paying so much money to get out of the trilogy and he obviously lost the arbitration because he cheated and cracked that man skull plenty of evidence surfing the net of him tampering with his gloves during sparring sessions! This guy is a clown!
Tyson fury the worlds top mental health advocate and most down to earth and humble sportsman, the man deserves everything that he has got in life.
Your days are numbered with bomb squad.
Can't take this cheating king seriously
If Wilder does make Fury respect his left and Tyson positions himself in the ring to counter the overhand right history will repeat itself. Can't wait for this trilogy 🥊
LOL Tyson Fury has pillows for fists he wouldn’t knock me out. Ducking the inevitable beating from AJ it seems.
I hope wilder beats tyson, I wanna see wilder really give tyson so big heavy punches, just so he knows what AJ is gonna bring to the table
🤣 Fury cracks me up...says he has been waiting for a fight, yet that he has just ducked publicly the biggest undisputed fight of the century 🤣
Wilder is embarrassing
Micky mouse fight on the way let’s all watch it lol
Why are they acting like he didn’t cheat in his last fight
What happens if Wilder actually wins...
Better.n
Let's go Fury!! I bet on Taylor cause of you...Let's gooo
Dispite being a Brit.. I have a feeling Wilder is going to knock Fury out this time...
ESPN using the British flag last used in 1801 🤦🏻‍♂️
Time for another beatdown
All that swag disappears immediately if Wilder lands one flush.
Revenge is the sweetest joy next to getting pxxy aka tupac from wilder
Fury's gloves did look suspicious but apparently he's good if he didn't get found guilty of cheating
They're gonna check your gloves Fake Fury. Be ready to fight without that advantage you had last time.
If wilder beats fury then we have to wait for another 5 years to get the 4th fight boxing nowdays is insane all business🙄🙄🙄
you ran from AJ
Fury gone get knocked out again
Will be a fury tune up fight before aj🤣 Wilder couldn't put him to sleep at 60%🤣
Deontay is such a hypocritical shmuck. When he was champion all he talked about was unifying the belt. And now that tyson was actually about to do what deontay could never do deontay does everything in his power to stop him from unifying. Deontay lost all my respect.
If he says he will beat him worse than last time, he will. Fury does what he says , he will.
I see that America takes to this guy more than their own fighters. He is a character but I'm not sure if its a good one.
I really like him but I think he is gonna loose this time. Overconfident..
Slither like a snake
Hopefully they check his gloves this time.  Fury obviously cheated in the 2nd fight, and he's apparently done that in other fights too.  The guy using bare knuckles is probably going to win.
Fury’s definitely on the gear🤣
Mon to Saturday an twice on sunday fury is one of the boxes that dose get better an better at first he look so confident he was bit open but he still new he was winning watch some of his first pro fights he got you close to the telly what you doing big guy to move like him aj in saudi the 2nd fight changed it it was watching someone else it will be a great fight them 2
Mans not wrong
Time’s up for you fraudulent!
Same guy that said Billy Joe Sandy Cheeks was gonna beat down canelo. He's so irrelevant to the sport of boxing. No one cares about what you say. Clown
Massive fraud  and liar never trust a fury apart from his uncle  Peter  he's   a genuine man  not luke muppet  and fraud
He's a fraud, clout chaser just like AJ said
Whats he gonna do this time, have a tampered glove, a baseball bat, a knife and a grenade and still be legit win.
Why is this interview in it's entirety not available, what is you tube afraid of?
How is Wilder going to win? If he is more agressive and comes forward he will get KOd faster than last time and if he tries to box on the back foot like before he will be neutralised, outboxed and KOd like last time. I just cant see a scenario where Wilder wins unless Fury gets too cocky and doesnt train hard enough.
Tyson (i would rather fight wilder again than Aj) Fury
He will beat the heck out of anyone at this point! If only I have money I'd be rich betting on him. God bless you Tyson Fury the king of heavy weight boxing!
I don't see any comments about having class. Oh gosh I love this guy is all I'm reading.
Only one fight we wanted. This ain't it.
Coach Greg has entered the chat
Only one Tyson Fury 👌🏼
ffs shut up Fury!!!! you talk so much shiz!!
Such a pointless, lose-lose fight for Wilder, who hasn't done anything to warrant a third fight since his TKO loss last Feb. If he wins, it's little consolation considering it'll be 2-1 to Fury & if he goes 3-0 down it'll just be embarrassing. We all want Fury/AJ, Beyonce has been dealt with!
Fury ain't winning the trilogy..
In a world full of YouTubers trying to be boxers.. Tyson Fury comes back and saves the day for boxing! Especially if he backs up everything he’s talking.
The Gypsy queen's antics are getting so old.
I smell fear... from EVERYONE! Revenge cometh swiftly to the wicked.
Carries wilders substance in his pocket 🤣
That last comment is so true
Ask him about Joe.
Deontay gunna drop that clown
Get off fury's nuts lmaoo
Am I the only one loving the 2002 This is the Way we Ball lil flip style chain Tyson is rocking?? 🤣😂🤣
Wilder is going to Knock out Fury!!!
Lol wth this dude always wearing
He's a proven cheater who has to fight in Saudi Arabia because he is banned from boxing in the UK.
AJ the only on making the HW division look respectable. These clowns Fury and Wilder say anything to make them look good but ducking AJ
Even as an American i’m rooting for Tyson. Deonte has been such a disgrace through all of this on top of just getting his cheeks clapped. If Tyson is trying to dodge the other dude that’s weak af too tho
Looks like a stupid guy with that outfit.
This man cheated and everybody talkin  crazy like he won fightin fair
Noone is interested, Noone wants this fight. Heavyweight division is fu**ing dead. No wonder UFC is surpassing boxing.
Hope he lost. Money absolutely change him and he becoming so hypocrite now.
Tyson is right, he's the only one selling the fights and selling boxing.  Want to see him cleanup all the divisions and wipe the floor with Joshua.
If you think wilder can beat fury you need to give your head a shake 🤣
Fury and the rest of us have been fucked over by Bob Arum.
They're both a Sunday stroll for Fury🏙🏞
Wilder will never see the title again. Fury take over!
Just no loaded gloves this time....
I had to comment on dis bs, okay first & foremost Lad Vegas belongs to none other than Floyd Money Mayweather. Secondly, I believe Wilder has a point to prove but even if he does lose, neither you nor Wilder can beat Anthony Joshua on his worse day. I mean come on Anthony Joshua hit hard as a bull but he does need to work on his chin. His chin is very suspect especially after he was shaken up by that nobody who gave him his first loss....
Wilder better not wear any suits this time 🤦🏼‍♂️
This guy sounds like a cheater.
He didn't want the fight you cheater and a liar
Fury is getting sparked this time, trust me 💥
Fury fury fury
THAT WAS ACTUALLY "COOL AND REFRESHING"😎
All talk(bulshi.) no action
If the match is going to happen before the Joshua fight there's no chance Wilder is going to win.
Running scared from AJ. Fury took over 14 months to agree to a fight AJ and yet he signed the 3rd fight with Wilder in a 48 hour period. Not to mention the timing of the arbitration and the AJ deal. He knows AJ has his number.
Cheat
Folk may criticise Wilders technique but privately behind the scenes heavyweights know he has frightening power. Just ask David haye or Richard towers. I take my hat off to any man brave enough to get in the ring and risk getting smacked by wilder.
Facts
He’s absolutely Right,, he’s the only character left who talks or heavyweight Boxing would be a joke,,, good luck in next fight champ
If a face expression could tell a thousand words he don't look that confident his words smh! Don't get put to sleep that first round 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I will tell you a fact. Tyson fury is the only reason I care about boxing
Too scared to fight Joshua 🤔
I hope wilder wins
Old racist bias media is DONE,New media is the Wave,Dontaes boxing,Ahki boxing,Blue Blood
Fury is a great steward of the crown
I love this man he has singlehandedly won me over he will be the goat 🐐 if he wins these next two fights
This guy has been trying to 6-7 months to duck out of the trilogy and try to use AJ to help him get out of the trilogy. The fact that he had to be dragged to court to be forced to honor his own agreement is really telling. Now Fury will start to make up lies to cover himself. Wilder never asked for step aside money, the fact that ppl still believe what Fury says is laughable
I hope he does,wilder should know when to quit.
The fraud and cheater TYSON FURY
Gloves will be checked this time no cheating.
The sore astronomy inspiringly offer because description summatively pour below a pushy washer. acid, capricious scallion
....and I believe him, I'll put that ugly a** vest.
He will smash these dossers.
We shall see
Tyson Fury is the Hunch back of Notre Dame
Tyson is the ultimate promoter
Yesp
He’s finding a bigger egg weight
Fury is gona be disappointed. This time round he's going down by KO. Take this to the bank
Gotta admire the mans confidence
Gotta be clean this time, no more tainted boar meat from farmers that dont have boars, no ricky hatton pulling at the gloves, and no spiked water excuses.
Let him keep on talking 👌🏾 My Boy is going to go crazy crazy
"Waiting for a fight" How when you were ducking a Fight? Coke head liar.
Tyson Fury the heavyweight king
I feel its getting made really difficult for this man were is the fairness for this man the others can't even lace this man's boots!!!!! Shame on the boxing accociation!!!!!
Correction. Heavyweight champ Tyson Fury.
You ducked wilder in the beginning and challenge him when he was older .. Fury cool
Can't wait for this fight now... 👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽
Biggest cheat in the history of boxing. Keep the gloves all the way on this time
Wilder fans are the most delusional fans in sports history
Wilder about to kill this dude! I just feel it. Dudes a cheater, revenge is as sweet as joy!
I mean fury is ruling the heavyweight division no doubt on it he is the man
I agree with him
I want the fury and Joshua fight
I think this time around he uses concrete gloves.
The day Tyson was born he drove his parents home from hospital 🚗 🏥
I wonder if this guy fought any of the Klitschko brothers. That probably would have been better for the sport in my opinion. But my guess is they're probably around Floyd's age and retired...
dude dresses like a 14 year old
Wilder getting whooped again 😂😂😂
WOW this is status of a black man vs a media gem..they would not praise Wilder like this firm believer
Fury will probably beat wilder again but I wouldn't count wilder out I just think wilder would have been a lot better off if he didn't make all those excuses after losing should take that frustration out in the gym and come back better
Wouldn't last 1 minute in UFC.
What A dumb sport boxing has become
U cheated shut it up fury with them humie the 🤡🍑gloves why u challenge aj to a bare knuckle fight I hear u Loud an clear 🤷‍♂️u getting knocked out
He's so confident, he must have a new cheating technique 🥊💉💰
You know your Cheating behind was Ducking this REMATCH...  I can't wait to see Fury without his Magic gloves...
Tyson is right boxing be boring without chisora tyson dillian these Characters people want entertainment. AN wilder is crazy getting back in with a giant that s still getting bigger an stronger
You gotta love Fury 😂💪🏾
Skipped right over the loaded glove question.....!
This dudes left glove is always floppy, when he does his jab with his left it doesn't even look right it looks like he's hitting him with his palm i noticed that when he was fighting another fighter and plus the second fight with wilder idk about the first. Go look at Dontaesboxingnation YouTube channel and type tyson fury he's got good proof and even him getting caught on doing it before
I wonder how many excuses Wilder will give when he loses this time. My power rangers suit was too heavy. Fury had a horse shoe in his gloves. My trainer should of let me take a career ending beating etc...
Fury is the man! King!!
“Joshua says I talk to much, but if I didn’t talk, boxing would be stone dead” 👏👏
Tyson “I fight once a year” Fury
AJ is gonna beat Tyson bad bro. AJ is just on another level when he is focused
Tyson is a coward doesn't want any smoke funny how he signed this contract asap
I think Fury will K.O. Wilder early in the fight. Fury vs Joshua is what everyone wants to see.
I believe this third fight will be different! I doubt we'll see the Wilder from the last match, this is redemption time for the bronze bomber, he's not going to take a defeat lying down! If he loses twice, I don't see him motivated enough to continue fighting!
Double double treble? This is a world champion, he seriously needs tutoring.
Lol this guy's a. Great champ  and he is entertaining
Wilder should have been paid I don't think the aj fight will happen now.
Boxing has been let down yet again. No one wants to see fury v wilder again. It's a disgrace. Fury don't want smoke with AJ. Look how quick he signed the 3rd wilder fight. But could've easily signed the AJ fight ages ago. All talk.
Bare Knuckle fight? Grow up, no more Versace? Gross! Tasteless!  Las Vegas is yours? What a match!
what happened to Joshua vs Fury?
I support Wilder because I support America. Sad how ppl claim to be patriotic yet don’t even support their own countryman. Happens so often.
Fury acting like he wanna be a 20 year old🤣
Fury changed his swag, hè looks like a brother.
The best thing to happen to Wilder was a loss....now he's working on the basics hopefully he stays disciplined & it will be a very different fight this go round
If Wilder didnt start bleeding from the ear during round 2; From Tyson's punch right behind  Wilders ear. Which caused Wilder to not be able to stand up right properly. Tyson Fury still couldnt knock out Deonte Wilder during the next 5 rounds😒. Remember Wilder had Tyson Fury sleeping on the canvas for 9-10 seconds completely snoring in the first fight. Wilder will beat Fury in this 3rd fight like I thought he did in the 1st fight. The Gypsy King vs The BronzeBomber III. I'm so pumped about this trilogy fight. Winner takes all.
BREAKING NEWS!!! gypsy queen ducks joshua
So you admit that you've been running from this kid for 18 months you had a contract to fight this kid and you've been running for 18 months and you've been forced to fight him you didn't want to fight him you are lying sack of s***
Hopefully they check his gloves this time, Not a Wilder fan but Tyson was throwing bare bone punches to the back of Wilders head period.
Wilder going to get it back in blood💯☄️
You offered him $20 million dollars to step aside cuz you didn't want to fight him no more and if you look at your gloves and that weight that you had in your hand you didn't beat him you assaulted him you attempted to murder him that judge saw it and that's why you lost your arbitration talk about that.
Every bit of wilder, I got it with me. Lol
Ask him about the arbitration hearing ask him about the cheating ask him about the metal weight in his glove ask him about paying Mark breland off to put some kind of drug into Dante Wilder's water ask him some of the relevant questions the talking points we don't want to care about him on no yacht and what he's been running around town doing
What tf is he wearing, looking like "Malibu most wanted"
When a Crackhead takes steroids 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You fury fans are funny. Can not wait to see him get flat lined.
So how are you planning on doing this if you use legal gloves cuz if you don't have an advantage from cheating and drugs you really can't beat anybody ask clinchcoat
Fury and Wilder both frauds who want nothing to do with AJ
UFC already got the dibs on the first live date in Vegas July 10 Sorry Tyson  Y’all had over a year to make this fight
Fury  will loose.... is he turning  American
He can’t cheat this to me!!!!!
Cringe guy man yall blind
I just glad we’ve come to a time where the best in the heavyweight division are willing to fight one another.We haven’t seen this since the 90s. I wish the other weight divisions did the same. I also think that this fight will sell itself due to the controversy surrounding Fury and Wilder.
No more Versace left..lmfao.. the most stylish and entertaining fighter on the planet...there’s only one, Tyson fury best boxer in the world!😎
Tyson talks in an annoying way
I know everyone seems scared to ask Fury any serious questions but someone needs to talk to this man about his dress sense man.
Just check the gloves this time.. I don’t know after watching those slow motion videos my rhetoric changed 🤔..
Fury coke voice back on steroid PED
A court ruling? Just fight! If they both announced they were were having a fight on my local field it would draw the biggest crowd you have ever seen, in fact the roads wouldn't be able to handle it, 2 English heavyweights on an English field, brilliant. And that's millions of smartphone footage for free. No matter what happens one of them will announce there retirement after it, why? Got enough money now thanks.
I love how they completely just glossed over the fact that Fury cheated to win last time. Come on main stream media either tell it all or don't speak on it.
Wilder by big ko..
I don't care if he's mohammed I'm hard Bruce Lee, You can't forget forget the name of the place your fighting.
OH come on!! We want to see JOSHUA BRUH!
Don't forget about cheating the sport 😂😂😂
You are a fraud a big dosser why you signed to fight that skin small legs ,yet you delay to fight anthony joshua
They’ll check Fury’s gloves this time and Deontay is super motivated. My money is on Deontay.
People who want to see Wilder v Fury 3 are the same people who will line up to get a ticket to see Rocky 7 😆
Furrrrrry
Where the full video?
Facts even if you lose or win
Fury is a fraud claims he wants to fight Joshua but didnt sing his contract then this happened , HE KNEW ALL ALONG THIS WOULD HAPPEN he is a fraud a big mouthed overrated Gypsy  liar .
Justice has served..... Revenge is coming...in blood....CHEATING BLOOD!!!!💣👑🥊💥
Wonder if wilder will come out naked this time so there's no extra weight to weaken him lmao
Fury is going to punish Wilder with his skill set.
I’ve got it right here in me pocket
He forgot that wilder dropped him twice in the first fight and trust me wilder been in the lab cooking something up for him 💯
I’m riding with Tyson Fury he’s going to punish Wilder🥴
The guys a bullshitter through and through
He’s fighting someone he beat 2x, dropped 4x, once to the body comming off a loss, 18 months off, a broken “dented” skull, coach change and surgery instead of unifying wit AJ. espn is spinning this hard to try and sell it. Someone get Kwame Brown on this scrub
Fury is a fast talker. You always have to watch a fast talker. Those funny looking gloves, failed drug test (etc.), and lob sided win in his second fight against Wilder (etc.), doesn’t help his case. What type of a person would overlook those facts.
"He (AJ) says I'm the one who does the talking, but if I didn't talk boxing would be stone dead because I'm the only character alive left in it! Let's say that for a fact!" - The Gypsy King 🥊
Outside of a lucky punch wilder is going to get destroyed
Hes my favourite. Lets go
Fury should make wilder come to the 🇬🇧
I hope so. If he doesn't, not going to look good on him. He must win💯
The internal female neurally surround because coal surely spill underneath a merciful water. inexpensive, longing ankle
I gave up ..... because of Tyson fury on his return to the ring now my life has changed forever
Deontay had better learned how to box.
Boxing has become a sport where everyone is afraid to fight the baddest man.... thank you FURY for putting your money where your mouth is.
Now let's see him get it done without CHEATING.....
Loved this interview!
True
Boxing will just fine w/o u fury
Fury's a clown
Fury never disappoints in an interview. I always expect to dislike him and I always come away disliking him.
They treat this foreign better than there own fighter
He talks as if he never lost himself lol
I hope BJ Saunders dad is okay
Wilder about to take another hammering and be put away for good this time. He should have just stayed away and fought Charles Martin or someone else.
Wilder frantically trying to prefabricate excuses for his next beating. 🤣
Now I see that Tyson Fury is a BIG 6’ 9 FRAUD like Wilder. We don’t need to see this fight again, we need to see Fury vs Joshua, I think he’s ducking Joshua.
you can do that .. you won’t have your special gloves though .. earn it
I love fighters that love to run their mouths
Tyson fury high on TV 📺 😆
Impossible Tyson doesn’t hit hard enough he can win again tho via decision
Fury is going to lose the second fight just like he lost the first one.
Fury is hilarious 😂.
Fury talking his usual bs....
He's right!! No doubt!!!
Deontay wilder really want his face to be smash again by tyson fury huuhh
This is the kind of talk we like to hear, no more glove cheating, real boxing.
Fraud!!!!!!!!
Watch Tyson get injured...😂😂
You’re a coward.. ducked Joshua and everyone knows it..
If he gets too cocky he'll get plucked but if he turns it to a boxing expedition he stands a great winning chance
He answered everything except, the putting stuff in his gloves lol 😆 I mean, we’ve all seen that photos and videos lol
Bro he just made me a fan💯
"I just wanna fight" 😂 blushit blag artist blagging Americans saying boxing would be dead without him haha was doing fine when you were on gear and eating takeaways you dosser
We'll see! I wonder why Fury tried to run from the 3rd fight?
Hes just great.
Tyson needs to uppercut this time a lot because wilder is going to head weave. But wilder is fucked again
Fury wouldn't even take the bare knuckle fight
"Las Vegas is mine"  🤣 love it!
No mention of cheating uh?!
No one wants to see it
Check his gloves!! They tried to kill that man and they acting like he didn’t cheat!!
Wilder loose its over for him
"I'm the only character left in it" that's a universal truth.
where can i but furys hat
lets go fury
Look how quickly he signed the wilder fight. I guess when you want to fight someone then signing is easy. Duxking joshua. Look how he avoids joshua
Wilder will be worried because he knows he’s getting another beating 😂😂
Notice he never denied tha glove statement. Come on maaaaan think people. Someone say you did it but you know you didn’t what’s tha first thing you say ??? 🧐
Everyone on the fighting scene now just comes off like they are trying to be Conor McGregor. I mean, I get it because it's entertaining but geez no one seems to be being themselves nowadays.
Honestly heavyweight boxing is back exciting because of Fury talking
kulaktaki sorun baş dönmesi yapar denge bozukluğuna yol açır wilder bundan dolayı dövüşemedi  eğer maç olursa favori wilder kazanır.
I had a feeling Fury would win the second fight, but now i have a feeling Wilder will knock Fury out... Don't get me wrong i like both of them...
He's going to put titanium in his gloves this go-around...😂
He's gonna get another good win against Wilder before getting knocked out by AJ.
Let's go Wilder! Shut this "Goats" jaw shut.
Kicked Ward and Bradley off and disrespect their earlier set. @AndreWard face says a lot when @TysonFury interrupted @ESPN
Okay fury I see that watch my guy
Fury. Love you bruh. But, Canelo is p4p the man.
I have a funny feeling Wilder is going to win..something in my gut tells me he will win.
White hype
I dont care what anybody says sometimes boxing is shady how can Tyson fury went down from 355 go 245 for wilder 1 steroids f hes team steroids he did soecialy at ges age
Let's hope Fury doesn't cheat this time.
Yes he will beat him again 🤣
*Wilder knocks Fury out*
I've never seen an American broadcast be so against their own countryman this much.
How can you not love tyson
Boxing is dead. It’s a joke. Mayweather has turned boxing into a joke. Now you have tik tok uppidy, white boys who have never even thrown a punch wanting to box YouTubers and then actually getting it done. And ppl actually wanting to see it. Such a joke and this world is nothing but a bunch of trolls
I got so much respect for this dude! All heart!
Tyson thinks we're all stupid
Notice he didn't address that glove situation 😂
I don't think so fury
Fruad
At this point, it wouldn’t matter if Wilder beat Fury because the damage to Wilder is already done. Everyone knows Fury beat him twice. A third fight makes absolutely NO sense 🤦🏾‍♂️
Love Fury ...what a man
Knowing this’ll probably be wilders last time makes me mad cause I really wanted to see aj vs wilder 😩😩
Best thing about this rematch is even tho we all know fury schooled wilder, but on the other hand we still know that with one punch wilder can change everything
Tyson is the king 🤴 🥊
I ain’t trying to start anything crazy here but Fury cheated in his last fight with Wilder. He Took out the padding in his gloves & it aint the first time he done it in a fight.  He don’t deserve the title. Wilder should still be champ but I ain’t going to lie that boy fury can box he just had to cheat to take out the beast🤷‍♂️smh
😂 despite cheating these comments are funny...
Gypsy King has Wilders soul and heart🤣💪🏽☠
Which probably means he isn't going to take the fight 😂 what can he do without cheating aside from get knocked tf out?
Dam i hope Wilder knocks that cheater out!!!!
Deontay Wilder will be the Undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the World!
Tyson you're the one that got me back into boxing I lost interest since Mike left or Cassius Clay Muhammad Ali whatever you want to call Helm it is going to end this guy's career it's not going to be pretty
He ain't lying
Fury is right
You can see fury’s knuckles in those green gloves, is that normal?
I love fury and I know theres alot of Tyson Fury fans so just wondering if any of you actually know the charity he donated 20million to? Because as of yet no charity has come forward no press has picked up on it and Tyson himself hasnt said which charity its gone to!  2/half yrs ago he also claimed he was going to build housing & shelter for the homeless would anybody be able to tell me if hes finished or even started that project yet? Or where it is? He also claimed he was donating £7million pounds to homless in 2018 its now 2021 and the homeless still waiting on the 7mil does anyone know any charity hes donated 7mil to? He also claimed to give a homeless man his size 16 shoes in america but was never snapped by press/paparazzi walking round bare footed does anyone have any proof that he did this? Pics or press articles?   So far Tyson Fury looking like Tyson Fraud when you do abit of digging... 🤷‍♂️🤔👀  But he does talk about mental health alot which most of the british population suffer from  i can see the attraction
Fury will be KO'd by Wilder, and this time, the ref's 12 count won't save him, neither will his attempts to load his gloves.
After all the antics I’m looking forward to fury eating wilder
Can't wait for the fraud to be dispatched right back to the UK
Wilder in 5
Lets not forget Canelo the greatest boxer of them all he has achieved much more than you have Tyson and he is a great character as well so I would have to say he is Number one Boxer in the world he holds the most world title belts at different weights now thats a real legend to fight and win against much bigger World Champions  in 4 different weights
Wilder is going to beat him.
😂😂😂 🙈🙈🙈
Mark Kriegel said Wilder said you put stuff in the glove. he actually brought that up. that was too funny
Fury is going to beat wilder worse. Wilder better work on defense
If u are goin to whoop him why didn’t u just honor the contract? Why did he have to take it to court?
He's not lying about HW boxing would be stone dead if it wasn't for Fury being who he is, Anthony Joshua probably the most boring personality of a HW.
Wilder will win the 3rd fight.
Negative!! 👉🏽🥊🧐🪨 🤔🤨🤨
TYSON is KING
This time, there's different staff in Wilder's corner.  Nobody is going to throw in the towel.... and Wilder might not walk out of that ring.  Fury is the bigger, stronger, and more polished fighter.  I don't see this ending well for Wilder.
Wilder gonna win by ko
Joe was talking too much
Why did the Joshua fight get canceled? I don’t want to see Fury beat up Wilder for the 3rd time🙄
He beat Wilder twice already. Smh
He’s not wrong tho.  Hate him or love him he’s the only boxer today that actually has a personality and does a good job hyping up his fights
His last words were straight facts
1:30 Fury is a serial ducker. Ducked the Klitschko rematch because he knew the real Klitschko (the one who fought Joshua) would show up, then turned to drugs in shame. Then when he won a title again, with punches to the back of Wilder's head, he ducked the rematch clause again - only accepting it eventually because he knows Joshua will walk through his slow pillow punches and retire him. He's been training for the Wilder fight for over a month already - no way would anyone train that early for the August Joshua date, even if you are obese. He knew the rematch clause was legally binding and would be enforced - Fury's just used Joshua for publicity for this lesser fight. I hope there's no rematch clause again, and I hope clueless Wilder can finally find a truly clean punch, which Fury wouldn't get up from (the other knockdowns weren't clean punches at all), because Wilder actually wants the Joshua payday fight, which Fury doesn't. Fury just wants to fight weak opponents for good money for as long as he can duck Whyte, Joshua, and even Joyce, etc.
Bruh we all saw the glove FOH
Tyson next time don’t cheat.
He cheated last fight
Won’t be watching this joke of a fight.
Y'all want that Great white hope so bad y'all had loaded gloves. Didn't show that part. Fuk ESPN
Tyson fury is the real champ. He ways defends all his belts!
Wilder will be back with hevier costume. And blame it again.
Enjoy this fight wilder fans cos this will be the last time you see him in a boxing ring😂😂.
Well your going to have to come up with another form of cheating then, the glove situation is out in the open, and the arbitrator obviously must have believed in the evidence shown that you cheated otherwise your defamation claim would have been taken into account, but seeing as it was thrown out, the arbitrator must also believed you cheated lol You ain't bashing nobody in this fight, you are going to run like a butchers dog and try and avoid getting knocked out
Mark my words. Fury is playing with fire and Wilder is gonna knock him out!
Got Tyson to win but I reckon he’s enjoying himself a bit too much in LA ... eyeballs are looking like dinner plates mush ...🐽🐽
Guess what will be Wilder next excuses?
Wilder is a warrior
Fury ducking AJ haha. So much for AJ is running from him. Actions speak louder than words 🦆🦆
I believe him. Destroy Wilder
I hope Wilder knocks this clown out 🤡
As if he didn’t know he was gonna have to fight wilder 😂😂😂 aj gonna smash him
Wilder vs luke 😆😂
After using AJ for clout.. now you running for an easy fight...plz ..Tyson  is a fraud
Clearly this been the plan from the start
Such a bad interviewer. Sounds like one of those guys selling dodgy perfume in the market.
He's living large with the money he promised to donate
I cant see Joshua out-boxing Fury. Not even a little bit.
1:26 he called fury a lady it sounded like😂😂the lady you were
I heard Charles Barkley guaranteed this...
I am gonna make some good money 💰 off this fight. Now that the pressure is on Fury and we know he can't punch to save his life. With no tampered gloves Wilder gonna be all over him.. Fury gonna get hurt. Watch.
Fury so right. AJ a simp
No1 cares ruined boxing
We shall see! I’m taking Deontay in the rematch.
2 days to sign the Wilder contract, couldn't agree terms with AJ over 5 months.🤔 Was the BIG Dosser Fury ducking, I believe so!
they way he roasted Wilder lmao
The guys asking the questions are gonna need a cigarette after this. 🤣🤣🤣
Seems coked up here
And here I thought this would one of the rare occasions where boxing gives us what we want.... I guess I was wrong...
BEFORE YOU BET YOUR MONEY ON THIS FIGHT DO ONE THING. GO AND PULL UP FIGHT 1 AND 2 AND LOOK AT WILDER FACE AND HIS EYES WHEN HE REMOVES HIS MASK.  IN FIGHT 1 HE HAD THE LOOK OF A KILLER IN THE 2ND FIGHT HE HIS EYES WERE GLASED OVER AND HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS DRUGGED FACTZ
Fury versus Joshua is the only fight! Wilder got beat twice already
😂🤣👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Fury is trash a glove cheat that the ESTABLISHMENT clearly supports ESPN is a joke for supporting this 💩 and turning a blind eye to this cheater
"I just want to fight"....hasn't fought in almost 2 years and only fought one top 10 guy in 5 years LOL
Tyson Bald Clown Fury, is an absolute joke of a fighter these days. Fury could have just paid the damages and had the AJ fight, he shook!
AJs got a big mouth with no substance 😂 it gets better and better every time he’s just talking about himself lol
He was right about EVERYTHING he said. Heavyweight division dead without him, and yes he absolutely smashed wilder, hope he does it again.. If wilder loses again, his career and validity are finished
Duck vs duck wilder fury 3
HE SAID HE KEEP THAT EGG SHAPE THING IN HIS POCKETS FOR 18 MONTHS
It’s funny that nobody in Wypipo Amerikkka is talking about the gloves....Americans rooting for a Brit and against an American Olympic Bronze Medalist....  Y’all really sumthin else...😒😒😒
This whole interview was straight Trash..
One thing about wilder that I'll give some credit for is his confidence, as bad as a boxer that he is.
Whatever
Tyson is the best heavyweight of this era he smashes all them dosers lol
Glove gate
Yea ok then how come he tried to get out of the fight
Quack quack baby
This going to the fight of the year may the best man win
Fury going on a PR run and people continue hating on AJ when he's been 10000% professional and acting completely right. No one can say he's running scared even tho his CV shows he's never been
I have to agree with his last statement
All these people act like this man didn't look like he was punching with his wrist the last fight he cheated and got away with it
The first match: Tyson Fury gets knocked down and later knocked out (with his floppy gloves on) by Deontay Wilder--referee admits to giving Fury a chance to revive, after being knocked out cold. Second fight.  Tyson Fury covers all bases this time, by employing a full court press of cheating, consisting of: custom made loaded gloves, pre-match sparring with manipulated and loaded gloves on sparring partner; turning off the  camera in his (Fury's) lockerroom before the fight; using same planned stratergy in his sparring trials of manipulate and loaded gloves during his actual bout with Wilder; coliusion with members of Deontay Wilder's team, referee; WBC president and league officials. I'd include mainstream sport media blackout (such as ESPN) of Tyson Fury's Glovegate, but they didn't run cover until after the second fight.   The third fight: Fury will have to face Wilder, without his "magic gloves and magic trolls in Wilder's camp."  Robbed of his huge unfair advantage; Fury doesn't stand a chance against the man he'll have to face in Deontay Wilder this time. The fight of the decade--the final showdown. No one wants to miss this historic event, because someone's going down hard--and I don't think it'll be Wilder--this time.
God i hope he stays Clean If he does he'll keep beating everyone
What a clown, Fury speaks cause he cat help it, AJ speaks when he needs to, and he put Fury in his pocket this week AJ 1 FURY 0
He is the biggest liar and the biggest snake ever to set foot on this planet
No 40 pound suit and no glove tampering is all we ask for
Dodging Joshua cause he knows he'll get KO   Absolute joke to British boxing!!!
For the life of me, i dont why Wilder is taking this 3rd Fight. His gonna absolutely dismantle in horrific fashion. There is just not enough time to teach Wilder how to box, as soon as He gonna get hit with that first punch his gonna l revert back to his old habits.
Another easy night work for the gypsy king  Wilder be out sooner this time 🥊
I love Fury’s showmanship but I have to be the one to say this.   Tyson Fury: “AJ has a big mouth and no substance”.  Also Tyson Fury: *does more interviews than fights the last 18 months*
Tysons a fraud haha aj fat Andy sent ya back to ya mummy after ya bottled in the corner ya crank
No more Versace in America... Lol
Bald coward
furlogh fury
Aj will knock fury out fact
I wonder what excuse that pathetic American dosser will come up with this time
So pumped up for July to see Dustin and Wilder get layed out
*.... at first, you hate the guy, then you love the guy) Wilder is going to be badly hurt this time, there are no doubts in my mind!*
Fury is a cheater. Google it
There’s going to be extra attention to the hand wraps and blocking of the locker room camera this time ...
Fury is going to ko that silly yank
Fury will be disgrace dis time around.
Fury will get beat up by AJ  👀💯  Keep playing with AJ  You say AJ name  😒
F R U A D
Boxing won't die if you  dont talk fury
Fury should get back on the drugs. Nobody cares.
The truth us Tyson Fury has the USA public whereas AJ went there once and git smacked hard. That is why Tyson could not care less of pissing off AJ at this point. It is back to Deontae and the Gipsy king to get all the attention. AJ vs Usyk is a great fight I fancy a lot but he wider audience not that much into it.
Cheater
Tyson reckons he's propping up boxing? He's the only character? 🤣 Then how is it Joshua is the one with by far the biggest worldwide popularity, endorsements, most titles, defences etc?  Fury is just popular with half wit chavs who call their kids names like Mercedes and Porsche. 😂😂🤡 🎭
Tyson Fury: if I didn't talk, boxing would be stoned dead.  Me: yeah you did talk I'll give you that 👍, but you didn't signed the contract with AJ 🤷,  But whatever the case maybe, best of luck to you both in the 3rd  rematch. Tyson Fury vs Deontay Wilder 💪🥊🥊🥊👍.
Wilder Vs AJ at Wembley is going to be great. I want Fury to beat Wilder but Wilder is going to win by KO.
Fury. LooooooL  He CRACKS me up
Anthony Joshua vs Tyson Fury is never going to happen
Lol he didn't say nothing about the glove
The boxing show is run by the mob, the winner has already been selected.
WE ALL HEARD WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO GOLIATH AND WHAT SIGNS PRECEED A FALL.
CLOWN Fury will loose to WILDER
Wilder fans are still crying
Annnd... The Biggest Cheater Boxing Has Ever Seen!!!
621st comment
I just can't wait to not watch this fight
Straight facts
They should have let him fight Joshua man. He's just going to beat Wilder again.  Not even entertaining tbh  He's too smart and Deontay has limited technique.
Am I the only person on here that can see right though this clown bullsh1t?  They've deliberately just wasted matchrooms time pretending they want the AJ fight and here he is talking again.  If this 3rd fight does happen,  I expect to flatten him with one shot, and then we will get all the excuses of the day
I actually do believe him lol
Like him or hate hes right.
Fury fought in deontay wielders country and won. He's not afraid to fight in your backyard unlike aj.
Fury told Schwarz that he would get him a fight on one of his cards... let's see if fury ever makes that come true
in all this clip i haven't seen a punch 🥊 from fury just slaps💅 and that crack the skull of wilder🤦🏾‍♂️🤷🏾 this is british corruption 💯🥜🙉
Ducker ducker
Deontay will destroy this fraud this time around. Fury has no power if he can't cheat.
Whats the date ?
Islam is the truth. Read the Quran
Espn can't afford the real champ aj 🤣
If he wasn't a champion, he would be cancelled.
that's what i like to hear 👊
Wilder shouldn't take that fight
Although I think this fight is a pointless one with only one outcome I feel wilder deserves the third fight, fury won both and will win again
Wilder coming for you!
Hi
He not lying
Wilders’ nutcase fans next excuse... Fury had melatonin in his gloves
Wilder Vs Fury mostly seems to me lyk a racist fight,,just in the comment section ,,,salt
I think he knew this fight was going to happen cos it was a contract he signed for. He has only used AJ to promote this fight for big pay day. How clever!
He acts like he's the only one in boxing ,canelo is the biggest star right now he gets the biggest numbers next could be Pacquiao
Fury clearly off his head needs money after a little patch off because he's figured out a way to cheat power don't just jump like that
wilder shoulda had a warm up fight i like him but won’t feel now ways if he gets smashed because he’s rushing into it
Fury will go down as the best heavy ever
Anyone else caught the coke head twitch ?
fury thinks we`re all stupid - maybe most of us are
So no fury vs Joshua then I take it?
We wait and see .. nothing guaranteed
He is an absolute beast of a man and he is right. He's really the only charismatic heavyweight worth listening to talk because he backs all of it up in the ring. I don't understand why Wilder is such a glutton for punishment because I truly believe he stands little to no chance against Fury unless he lands that heavy leather somehow. But I don't see that happening. Fury KOs him within 6 rounds.
The step aside money would have been a lot less than what wilder is going to make from this overall. Arum definitely tried paying him off. Because there’s a 150 million dollar deal about to crumble on Saudi Arabia
whats point of having fury on an interview....nothing that comes out of his mouth is true
tyson fury is a poes
Lol this coward literally tried to pay wilder not fight him lol. Bomb squad
So he doesn't want to give wilder 20 m to step aside, but he's willing to put up 20 a piece for a bare knuckle fight with Joshua? Lol why not give 10 a piece to wilder and save 10
Please get a bigger ref for the 3rd right. Kenny Bayless was too small to break both heavyweights. Don't forget he had to deduct a point from Fury because he kept punching on the break.
Great white hype
with the right trainers deontay wilder can beat fury seriously
Getting help from the media already trying to break  wilder before the fight  this is disgusting
tyson cheated so i don’t wanna hear it
*Tyson fury* is going to be the overwhelming favorite but when I see everyone taking one side because no one thinks he can lose, that’s usually when I get burned on a bet! This is a heavy weight fight, one punch from any of those guys can end it!  Crazier things have happened!?! I’d put $100 on that fight for the fun of it,  I smell a upset!
Without furry HW boxing is boring ...facts
Fury talks to much he really needs to humble
No title defenses ever in a horrible era. Popped twice for PEDs. Only good win is 2nd Wilder fight who can't box. Got the belt against old Klitschko and stunk up the place then ducked the rematch. Wallin got cheated cut was the worst I ever seen without the fight being stopped. He needs to prove how good he is like the truly great heavyweights of the past.
Fury is for real man Wilder better come with it looking forward to a good fight
The biggest payday in boxing history will never happen it's all talk AJ should move on he holds all the meaningfull belts
Deontay ain't talking, he's training day in day out. I can't support a fraud
BOMB SQUAD.
Main stream media is garbage smh
Espn a joke big Corp, exposed get this cheater in the ring to be knocked ASAP
Fury gonna beat wilder bad…Fury might put wilder in the hospital permanently 🥊
He ain't got the body of a fighter but his attitude and mentality is great...probably the reason he's world champion.
Can you imagine this guy in the NFL. He could actually do that next after banging up Joshua and Wilder. He would be a terror on the defensive line...
To beat fury you must pressure him and don't be afraid to get hit and hit him hard to the gut as many times as you can than hit him hard with uppercut and it will be done for fury but the punches must be hard to the gut then when he bend from the pain  hit him hard with uppercut and it's game over for fury it will be knock down
Cocaine is a helluva drug 🤣😆
This time he'll put titanium vibranium in his gloves 😄  But yeah Fury will win again, he just has Wilder's number
Fury will get beat badly by Wilder!!
Hes only 32 I thought he was mid 40s 😳
*Mannnnnn....... this fight is going to be good*
Wilder will regret taking the trilogy and leaving Mark Breland !
He's 50 pounds bigger. He's more experienced. He's ferocious. He's going to beat the life out of Wilder. Again.
Good thing Wilder is fighting the trilogy now. Because the titles will be fought between Fury and Joshua for atleast 2 years.
2001 called, they want their hip hop chain back
Please make it not ppv
I wouldn’t mind watching Fury vs Wilder 3 if they had both lost 1 a piece😴….. Fury won both fights last time🙄
Cheater stop the cap...you know you did everything you can 2 get out of this fight...
Espn Ignoring The Fact That He Cheated
Deontay wilder will Destroy fury
2 blk men runing from the white guy smh.... fury is definitely the undisputed heavy weight champion of the world... much respect
He Probably Found A Better Way To Cheat
Bumsquad wakanda never is getting spanked again
Wilder knocks him out this time.
Not excited. Rathered aj. Why we wanna see this for a 3 time? Mix it up. Wheres miller at?
There is no interest for this fight , everyone knows Fury is gonna smash Wilder , i will prefer to see Fury or Wilder fight AJ or Whyte or Ruiz  . I don't see Wilder beating Fury , i just don't see it , Fury too big and a better boxer, what weight is Wilder gonna come in at , 220!! Fury is coming in at 275 , style make fight and Fury is all wrong for Wilder
The flappy gloves king says he can do it again. Lolz
WILDER IN 5 BOMBZQUAD!!! WILDER IS GONNA PUT HIM THROUGH THE ROPES!!!
I heard. No lies
Fury can't use does oven mitts this time people will be watching very close no cheating this time around
A revenge will coming at eight
Your bringing down 🔻⬇️ the value of ESPN the 🌎🌍 wide leaders in Sports. Telling 🤥 y'all are plummetting over Steven A Smith forehead, Kwame Brown,and 100 million dollars lawsuit if you didn't sign the contract.
How and he can’t cheat this time?
He really said he'll cheat wilder worse than last time
Another trash fight. Easy win for Fury. The best fight this year will be Pacquiao vs Spence, no even close.
Cheater
Wilder by KO
Whoever calls this guy humble is an absolute joke
I have a crazy love hate relationship with this guy. He talks so much bollox but he makes me 😂
Why doesn't fury fight ruiz?
ESPN... full of it. Y’all know Fury cheated. Y’all know that lawsuit gone hit. Wilder gonna whoop his behind
Fury getting knocked out this time
Wilder will knock this cheater out on a even Plainfield
fury the truth
Fury/AJ was never happening. Bob made a fool out of Eddie. Nobody wants to see noodle legs get smashed again but big nose Bob just couldn’t allow that plastic Eastender get one up on him. Sad for boxing fans is the end result once again.
Good luck
He's gunna lose to wilder watch
He cheated
Stop that cap!! 🧢 👏🏿
Tyson Fury’s got this! 2nd round KO incoming 🥊🙌
Dead Man Walking ⚰BombSquad🔥
Fury is telling the truth, if it wasn't for him I would have no interest in boxing, zero.  Even the Mayweather stuff is dull.  I would watch Mayweather fight a "real" fighter, but not a YouTuber.
I can't wait. Wilder is a dead man walking.
It sounds to me he have fear in his heart he know that would not be no cheating this go-round
Who cares...
Fury u are going to get hurt
Fury is no killer..Never Knockout anyone before .He's a skillful boxer that wins on points and TKO....Wilder early or Fury by points..
ESPN is telling us lies 😂🤦🏾‍♂️☠️💯 They had Steven A Smith the talking head their best analyst to go on National Television to beg Deontay Wilder not to fight Tyson_🐔 Ferociousness to take 20 million dollars to step aside. You can't lie your way out of the truth those🥊 will be heavenly examine and you will be required for the Olympics procedures. You will be force to return what was stolen 😂🤦🏾‍♂️☠️. It's bigger than 🥊🥊 now ESPN like y'all said, "that's how you properly walk onto the set."🐔⛳😂😂😂😂😂
There is only one cheating fury
Slap fighting means you have something in your gloves to slap him with
You won't be able to put an object in these gloves , the court knew he cheated that's why Wilder won the arbitration
The goat has spoken again
ESPN SUCKS.  TYSON FURYS A DUCK
I wholeheartedly believe him. 👏
I belive him
Cheater
Well we will see
We all know.....Fury has technically already won Twice.   3rd fight wasnt needed,but I'll tune in
HE GETTING KNOCKED OUT!!!! BOMB SQUAD!!!!
Fury by TKO in 5.
Your eyes tell us a much different story i see fear
No u not fam you a cheater and a none cheater in boxing u knew you could not beat wilder off of pure boxing skills so they let you cheat just do beat a undefeated black boxer but u cheated boxing a few different times wilder is gonna punish you
He bout to get beat watch ! there will be no cheating this time 👀
Not even watching the video. Just clicked to say this clown tries so hard to appeal to the urban community. Like you look like a fool dude.
People is still thinking that Tyson cheated... Nah, Wilder can't box. He always needed a lucky punch and without that, he's pretty much a drunk dude.
Yeah if he cheat again!!
Anyone pickin wilder is a punk. Joshua is a stooge
Gypsy king y'all🔥🔥
Its easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God
Tyson Fury I'm sorry but you're going to lose this fight you're a cheater you  not able to a cheat this one any more,  you will never get away with this one again I got guarantee you will lose mark my such a dirty fighter
MUST ADMIT THO, WILDER HAS BEEN WORKING HARD
wait can someone explain to me why fury isn't fighting Joshua anymore like we already kn fury can beat wilder why is he fighting him for the 3rd time and not AJ ?
Wonder what Tyson is going to do to his gloves this time 👀
LETSSSS GO!!!
And  when WILDER drops him because he can't cheat ; I need that same energy from him.
Deontay Wilder's not fighting Tyson_🐔 Ferocious he's fighting the talking heads of Steven A Smith and Shannon Sharpe sponsored by My Momma's Seasoning. Most likely I'm a 100% sure of a KO I bet the USA on it. Can't lie or cheat your way out of the Truth 😜.
Well we will see...
He never denied it
AT LEAST WILDER IS FIGHTER INSTEAD OF COWARD AJ
Lets just hope this time there is *NO Rematch Clause* Whoever wins, just put this Sht Show to bed for good. But Don't get your hopes up because Neither of them want to fight Joshua.
Shut up. Ducking Joshua
L
After seeing this... I don't know how Deontay is gonna handle these press conferences😅😭
Agree completely. He's the better, more versatile fighter in every way.
I think Wilder will take Fury more seriously this time. But.....if I had to bet MY MONEY.....it will be hard to pick against Fury
How?! U won't have that egg weight in your gloves this time!!!
Lol than why u try to avoid the third fight?! U could of had the third fight and been preparing for Joshua smh
Wilder bandwagon fans woke up. Where you been all year? 😂 Excuses, excuses, excuses...
Gypsy👑🇬🇧🙌🙌🙌  (1.) Roy Jones Jr. (Unbeatable in his Prime) (2.) Adrien Broner (My favorite to watch) (3.) Keith "1Time" Thurman (The total package. Can't wait until he and Crawford 🥊) (4.) Floyd Mayweather (TBE🥊) And now my #5 favorite boxer/fighter (5.) Tyson "TheGypsy👑🇬🇧" Fury (6.) Kimbo Slice (A absolute phenom) (7.) Royce Gracie (legend fighting with no weight classes) (8.) 🗣️Saul Canelo Alveraz🇲🇽 (best 🥊 on planet 🌎 right now)
He is a cheater I dont think he should have a title
Wilder should have taken a warm up before going into another beatdown
Idk if it will be worse than last time but fury will definitely win
Just don't poison his water and slip out your hands out the gloves like you did again.Come up with some new cheat tactics this time.
I want to be a gypsy
Drug cheat Fury. People are quick to forget this bun was ban for 2 years for ban substances. Cheater
Lakers in 5.
Go to work 💯
Wilder has no chance. His punches take WAY to long and he has no jab. Fury gonna beat on him again.
AJ lost to a chubby heavy hitter. Against Tyson he’ll near lose his life. This arbitration is the best thing for Joshua
Use correct gloves this time don’t cheat fury
FOR SURE MY FAVORITE BOXER
I’m ready 💯✊🏾💪🏾 Boooomb sqaaaaaaud!!!!!!!!!!
I’m tired of doubting this man I believe him.
Hopefully he doesn’t cheat this time
He continues to duck Anthony Joshua
fury speaks nothing but facts
Coward tried to run from a 2 fight contractual obligation because of the truth. Wilder is gonna make sure those gloves aren’t tampered and Olympic style drug testing is implemented. The King will return.
Wilder has a very low IQ, there is no way he beats fury.
Wilder rock that heavy costume again!😂.. such a money grab fight, ridiculous .. Fury should have a new challenger.
Fury got lucky in the 2nd fight. He won’t be able to get up in the 3rd.
That crackhead’s days are numbered
Nobody wants to c this fight
Whatever he said, he has done it. I feel he has improved his aggresive game much more so it might happen.
He on that booger suger again... that nose candy.... sweet nose....crystal nostrils... Powdered snot... brain chalk... happy dust...
The Death Star
Fury >>> Beyonce Wilder
Make sure he has his gloves all the way on when he fights his next fight
Fury wanted the fight in a stadium so Wilder would have to walk longer in that suit
cheating and than wanted to pay him off so he wouldn't have to fight them again
Tyson fury always was a cheater. Nobody remembers when he pop positive for steroids and got suspended.
Wilder wins
Hey!! We at Taco Bell would like to introduce our new naked chicken chalupa 🌮 also come by your local store and try our revamped value menu 😎 🌮🌮  Taxes and chargers apply to state!!!
Tyson talks so much trash, but he’ll always get my respect bc at least he can back it up
Bla. We want the AJ fight stop this ducking
Fury in 10....that's being generous off of wilder's new training video hype
He a cheater I could see with my eyes his glove flipping around on his hand.
CHEATING DUDE GONNA GET THE BRAKES BEAT OFF HIM 💣💥BOMB SQUAD💥💣
Loser there won't be anyone there. No one cares about this fight.
Vitali Klitschko is the only one who I think could have beat an in shape Fury. His size and defense are too hard to match up with.
He requested a BARE KNUCKLE FIGHT cause last time he had a funny glove and they ain’t go let him cheat
"The big big big stadium" is code for he's forgotten the name of it.
This guy has no skill or power just 6’9 270 he’s just bigger that’s all
For this trilogy it will not be necessary to count on a pocket referee !!😂
Till this Day! Bombquad! Tyson going to have to give the bronze bomber fair fight this time. No more egg weights no more baggy gloves.
*All hail the gypsy king 👑*
We need to keep an eye on  Eddie Hearn. He promised a 150 million site fee for Saudi Arabia stadium and no fight. That  crown prince don’t mess around over there.
He’ll beat him worse because he’s going to cheat even worse. Not! Because all eyes are on this piece of shyt “human” being because of his perpetual cheating. What a disgrace to all true-to-the-craft, hard-working, and honest athletes.
Who would believe this clown aha
I doubt that
Every time i hear joes voice i think of fight night RD 3
cheat worse than the last times
We will see You Hump
All facts by Fury. He the man in boxing today. Hate it or love but you gotta accept it lol
The real king is back
Smh  can't wait tell d ko him out in 6 rounds
Deontay wilder got beat up in the last fight what can he bring this time Tyson fury just looks to be getting the Joshua fight interesting
Nocap everything Tyson said
Hes not gonna be able to cheat this Time Wilder is gonna beat his ss.
FURY CAN'T CHEAT WITH HIS 🥊🥊 LIKE LAST  TWO FIGHTS WITH DEONTAY WILDER
If wilder come in this third fight with boxing technique... Fury goes to sleep. A wilder who's throwing shots in combination like a Oritz is crazy dangerous but if he comes in with that hand cocked waiting on one shot he's done
He forgot the name of the stadium
Check them gloves in fight 3
I don't believe he can beat him again anymore. Also Anthony Joshua. Because this guy pride himself too much in many ways. He just became a trash talker. I used to like him a lot and follow him around but now he is no longer humble and faithful person anymore. He forgot who put him at where he is at now. If you turn your back to God then God will turn his back to him. Feel sorry for him but wish him all the best.
I gotta gud feelin Wilder gonna sleep 💤  Fury.
When will everyone learn that the elites decide who wins who loses if they want wilder vs Joshua it will happen no matter how many comments you type
If Fury stays focused he can back those words up too!
I wonder what the ppv will be since there is less interest in this fight
I’m black n from the hood n I’m rollin with Fury
So the fight between fury and Joshua in Saudi Arabia is canceled ?
Wilder can't box
The cap is so out of place in that 6'9 250 lbs body LOL
Bruh I can beat Tyson fury...just give me till he 80 and hasn’t trained in 40 years
Can't wait for Fury to destroy that clown again
Check this joker gloves from the start
The evanescent mailman antenatally pat because rhinoceros antenatally brake vice a unsightly reaction. imaginary, elegant sailboat
He’s the most confident and smooth talking talker, and hardest fighting fighter. He’ll beat Wilder like nothing. Then beat Joshy. I’m a fan of all three, I love them they’re what the sport needs. But Tyson Fury is the best of them. He’s the hardest of them all now. He’s the fastest. And he’s the Supreme. I’ll say it now.
Deon who?
All the English need not claim Josh Taylor. He aint English, he's Scottish that's 3 Mexicans he's smashed in a row . 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Tartan 🌪. Josh will give Crawford a run for he's money, no doubt!
If he cheats then yes
Wilder start running buddy
He will win that fight every time if he doesnt get too cocky.
As Lo him about his gloves my dude.
First to hear this bull
